continue tonight maybe go up a little step a little bit higher but we'll get to it in just a second I want get to something I want you to really see something I believe the Lord I was skipping through all this and and it just something told me to go back so I went back to to the Book of John because we're if we're required to have these virtues right they're requirement right they're requirement to come to adoption all right and if Jesus came to adoption on River Jordan by I mean not River Jordan at Mount Transfiguration by type then there's got to be somewhere that he Jesus opened the door that that can happen to us right and he did and we'll read it this we'll read it tonight so let's go to the Lord in prayer Lord thank you for this evening that you've give us thank you for the song service Lord and the musicians and all the ones that come Lord on the Wednesday night father I pray that You' just strengthen all of our bodies Lord and keep us keep us healthy Lord for the journey ahead Lord I pray that you'd be with the ones that are sick that you'd raise them up Lord for for your honor and Glory father May there be a testimony in all this that we're not seeing now but Lord may we see it a little bit later father just bless us now touch the ones Lord that are traveling ones that are not with us I pray that you'd be with them be with the missionaries on the Foreign Fields be with Brother David and sister L they come in Lord this weekend and brother George next weekend Lord I pray that you'd touch them Lord be brother Vernon also have a safe trip over here father just be with each one give us this day our daily bread in Jesus name we pray amen the Bible says in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth now you take this man that we've been talking about that word was the what that was the theophany that was the that was the logos the speech the word it's all Jesus Christ it's all God it's all the father it's only one person all right everybody with me so that word is going to be was made flesh back then and now that same word in all those attributes except for we're not healer or savior or Redeemer but how close are we though where the Bible says that eternal life will be given to someone for being good to you is't that you imparting eternal life okay let's see what we got here in the Book of John so full of grace and truth let me read one more then you sit down Jesus answered and S them very I say to thee except a man be born again he cannot see or understand the kingdom of God and you be seated the Lord as his Blessing to the reading of the word again thank you for coming and we appreciate all of you love you with the love of the Lord and we thank you for all the things that you've done for the again for the funeral last week and and we sure did uh we sure did appreciate all of you coming and working and and um taking a little bit of load off of us we sure appreciate that John John 16:12 says I have yet many things to say unto you now look this is John 16 all right we're fixing to go to John 17 this is John 16 Jesus is Jesus is getting ready to leave all right he is the spirit of truth right I know it's Wednesday night but an amen will do just fine like Sunday and Wednesday be good to say Amen okay if you don't believe the scripture then you're in the wrong place you need to go find another building but Jesus was standing there he said look I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now in other words why was he going to tell them everything and they not understand it right so he was going to hang on and he said hang on a minute how be it hang on that's good um southern English how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all truth there was one man standing there that had all the truth he was the truth all right but he knew that there was something inside of him that was going to come out on the day of pentec or the burial and Resurrection but on the day of Pentecost that was going to divide Out Among a group of people and then they were going to start understanding what he said all right same way with me and you you go through your life you you go through your life numb and talking to somebody the other day just you're in a fog you think you're you think you're clear and you think your thinking is clear and you think everything's clear and I'm clearly thinking and I'm clearly doing and if you born again you're in fog the devil's got a big old fog over your brain all right why to make you believe something that you shouldn't believe whatever the world gives you but now look but when he the spirit of Truth has come all right he will guide you into all truth so then he there's your guide that's going to guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself like I said before he's going to speak through Ministry to a group of people called the bride and we're going to see in just a minute that even Jesus I caught this in this um uh what we're going to read the in John 17 we' read it many many times before but remember Jesus is he he come to die for everybody all right all right just listen to me he came to die for everybody John 3:16 whosoever believeth on him all right okay for God shall love the world he gave his only begotten son who shall believe in him shall not perish but have everlasting life all right there's a group that that's going to cover everybody with me all right but there's a group that's going to go on and not just him going to to save them there's a group of people that's going to be him John 3:16 is not he didn't say be like me he said I'm going to die to save you if you'll accept me so while this growth if there's not something else in the scripture where Jesus is standing there he's going I know there's going to be a group that just going to that's just going to love me and and I'm going to be their Savior and that's going to be pretty much it and then you got the foolish virgin you got the people that are you know cup of water in my name which really not even included any of this but the foolish virgin at least is Sanctified by the Holy Ghost right but there's a group of people when Jesus was standing there we'll read it in just a few minutes where he just totally separated the group I'll show it to you in just a minute cuz whosoever whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he shall show you things to come and thank God he gives us revelation we should be Revelation people all right and when we get into this statue of perfect man up to The Headstone where we see the headship of the church coming back in the opening of the seals that's not skim melt that's not baby food all right you're not going to get it pureed or pureed or pure Aid how you say that y'all said it three different ways so I'll say it scrambled up Mama used to way before there was Gerber when we were growing up she'd take English peas and just mash them up you know and feed them to terance that's why he is the way he is so can't eat anything green but that's what God's done though through all the years he's pureed ped beat up patted the word and said here baby you can swallow this but remember then when you get to the Apostle Paul who never knew Jesus but when the Holy Ghost filled him and he became an apostle and when he became a prophet to the church age especially when he saw that group at Ephesus he knew that there'd be a group that would understand this and then there'd be a group that would understand this and it'd be a group that would understand more cuz even his brother Peter brother Peter Peter and Paul comes together after so many years preaching the same thing why they got the same Holy Ghost all right so then he looks at Peter and Peter looks at John at Paul and says um Paul says things hard to be understood and we wrestle at those things you know to their own destruction but then Peter comes up in in First Peter second Peter and he's saying just what we were talking about Statue of perfect man he's the one that brings us the Statue of perfect man and then it took a a prophet brother brandham to the master builder to bring it all back together all right so that you can so that you can now physically see what a pyramid is for whatever thing is for it where the headstone is why there's a gap in there where it says holy spirit we ought to get to that sometime but listen to this and I heard it word a voice of great multitude and the voice of many Waters and the voice of Mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be a raid and fine linen clean and white for the final linen is the righteousness it doesn't say of God it says of the Saints you have come to a place of righteousness not self-righteousness no way but righteousness through Jesus Christ through a mature understanding of the message now I don't mean just the message I mean the Bible all right when I say the message the Bible is included we don't disclude the Bible and just take the message all right if you're going to throw one away I'll throw the message away give me the Bible then know what brother Ram said fa found a resting place lays in the word of God all right but we know that it does tie together we know that for a fact and no matter how much we try to think that we're right and saying a Creed or joining Church you'll steal what you were until you're actually born again of the spirit of God it doesn't change you what all this other stuff doesn't change you the new birth is an experience that's what changes you that's what puts you in the body that's what puts you in this as we were saying the other day that's what puts you into the line of adoption it puts you in family to where you can even be considered an adoption all right cuz remember the devil has got kids and and Jesus Christ never spoke of them people well he did called them snakes vipers and all that other stuff all right told them they was of their father he told them what lineage they were all right but now he did tell us though in the Bible what lineage we are cuz there's going to be a group of people that's going to be like him now what is him what is Jesus Christ that right that's the fullness of Jesus Christ headstone the whole thing the head and the body is together in this picture right here but now you got to remember that this part up here when he died and went to heaven come back as the Holy Ghost he came back as the Cornerstone the Chief Cornerstone bbody with me this was not on the church now in part it was all right because it was they were led by the Holy Ghost but as we've been reading for many times right here the Antichrist Spirit comes into the church and even into the bride even into the bride brother Ram said the bride went to NAA to try to help and change everything and got caught up in that same system all right how that the Antichrist would come into the church file it make it lukewarm formal and Powerless all right now hang on with me just for a minute let's go to St John 17 this is where I want you to see something real quick then we'll move on I was looking for you know you look at Jesus and you say well that's the embodiment of God right that's the embod Jesus is everything that we need all right he's the whole he's the whole the whole Angela if you want to say that he's everything there's no title that he doesn't cover in Christianity all right now there's no there is no listen to me there is no attribute of God that's not right there every attribute of God that is God that is Jesus Christ in human flesh God in human flesh Jesus Christ standing on the earth speaking to people because the only thing we've got even to the even to the headship even to the uh when the Bible says The Headstone was rejected we'll get into that a little bit later on but remember when I say headstone I'm talking about Jesus Christ the fullness all right the fullness of Jesus Christ is him standing on Earth in a human body called the son of man all right is everybody with me now but what is inside that son of man God we know that the Holy Ghost everything that Spirit of Truth um the faith of Jesus Christ brother R says the virtue of Jesus Christ the knowledge of Jesus Christ The Temperance of Jesus Christ the patience of Jesus Christ the godliness of Jesus Christ he says the brotherly kindness of Jesus Christ he said love which is Jesus Christ all right so that's all Jesus Christ so now wherever he's standing he is the embodiment of all that right now we know we got to be a part of it somewhere right we have to be a part of this this is where I was looking at just a little bit ago at home but watch now here's Jesus the fullness of the godhead bodily nothing else outside of the Bride he's it and remember when he was talking the bride's inside of him you and me are inside of him when he's speaking this message all right and we've got three and a half years to listen to what he's got to say and that's pretty much all we got to go on but Paul can write 80% of the New Testament off of those three and 1/2 years that Jesus lived on Earth and he wasn't even there but the holy ghost that was in him was there the holy ghost that was in Paul was there so now here's St John 17:8 now watch he's he's standing and to me this is The Lord's Prayer to me we know what the Lord's Prayer is Our Father who are in heaven Hallowed be thy name right but to me this is the prayer to the bride separating us from the world not not putting not taking us out of the world but separating us from the world cuz remember there was a day when brother brandham now he wasn't Jesus Christ but he was more of Jesus Christ than me and you are right now I'll promise you that everybody say Amen all right he was a prophet an end time Prophet that God spoke through him so much to where he said on tape one time he said this is not William Brown speaking this is God speaking I'm just using his voice and you know what you know what it sounded like right it didn't sound like some great Thunder it was brother Brown's voice okay so this is a man brother brandom has come to the end time to bring us come at the end time to bring us that part of Jesus Christ back that had never been here before that was the fullness he was in part I know in part Paul said even I prophesy in part but that which is perfect is come that which is in part will be done away not done away done away thrown in the trash but built on to everybody with me cuz even during Paul's time The Headstone was not understood like it is now okay he didn't have the seals he didn't have the great opening of the word like that John John had it in a in an image form or in a he could see what was going on and he had a small Revelation but he was only told to write right he was only told to write it down what he saw all right well now you and I are reading what he saw amen but we got to make it live remember we were talking about the white paper and the black ink pretty cheap to do that but when you live it and worth 10,000 worlds so now read with me real quick this is Jesus now he's getting ready to leave all right now if I'm not mistaken I did this in a hurry this afternoon if I'm not mistaken this prayer is prayed somewhere around the upper room somewhere close I'll verify that make sure of it somewhere around the upper room now he may not be in there with them but he's praying this prayer somewhere out maybe Garden of Gethsemane I don't know I'm we'll look and see but he's doing one thing he's by himself and he's praying right and then when he talks about them now watch when he talks about them everybody with me we're going to go slow you don't have to say Amen just listen to me when he talks about them that's talking about the ones that are there with him which it was only 11 at the time Judas if it was The Upper Room Judas had already left he was the devil anyway so he wasn't going to understand this so it was only to 11 people so after they died we're finished no he must be speaking to the group when he says them he's speaking of them and them because watch what he says for I have given unto them The Words which thou gavest me and they have received them and have known surely they didn't know that at that time if they' have known who he was he wouldn't have died alone they ran away when he died on the cross there was no one there not one person hung around and said hey that's my savior that no because that I can prove it to you because as soon as now he's Jesus die buried resurrected live for 50 days walking among his his people and he's getting ready to ascend and and he says I'm getting ready to go and he says go and receive power on high you know we've been reading that scripture what's the first thing they ask him are you going to restore the kingdom we heard you say that several days ago you were going to you know a month or two ago we heard you say was going to destroy this Temple and raise it up in three days and we want to get rid of these Romans so we really ain't understanding what's going on but we know you're pretty tight guy with God so you know are you going to you know like wipe these people off he said no he said go to Jerusalem go to Jerusalem and wait what to be endued with power from on high in other words wait until the Holy Ghost comes inside of you and quickens what I've already said so this group of people that's why St John 17 is to the right of the first church age but he's also speaking to the Bride of the last Church age cuz we're going to culminate this now the bride in the middle there's no problem with them but remember he's standing in the Candlestick with his hands out the Alpha and Omega right but he is everything in between there is bride down through the church ages but that first church had to be established because it was the foundation of all Christianity is in first church and God is is through Jesus Christ is depending on them to start it but they're not starting it right here so God is p praying a prophecy everybody with me he's praying a prophecy listen he's not a prophet he's the prophet okay he is the prophet and he's getting ready to go to Calvary he's had the mount Transfiguration they've told him what he was going to do he told them in the upper room what was going to happen and this right here watch but just let just just watch just just pretend you're you're sitting there and you're sitting at the Rock on the Rock beside of Jesus and he's praying nobody but him but you can listen well we were there cuz we were in him in Holy Ghost form you know so we didn't actually hear it with our ears but it is part of your attribute right this right here is part of your attribute all right so this is part of the statute of perfect man this is the part that to me brings it together and then separates what needs to be separated watch for I have G given unto them The Words which thou Gest me all right so he gave a three and a half year sermon to a group of people that no one listen No One understood except just a little bit Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God we don't know what's going on but we just believe what you said then Peter jumps up and saysi just cut the guy's ear off so you know so they were confused they have received them what the words what Jesus spoke the words I spoke they have received them and have known surely that I came out from thee and they have believed that thou did send me now that had to be a prophecy no one standing where he was at on that day knew what he was talking about with me I pray for them I pray not for the world there's been Brides brides churches Brides I'm going to read it in a minute brother Brown separated it God's going to do it right here I pray not for the world but for them which thou Hast given me wait a minute for they are thine he's putting it back on the father all right and all mine are are thine not two people but but in in in form of Father and Son and thine are mine puts it right back in him and I am glorified in myself he said I am glorified in them that I'm talking about now if he's glorified in them he's already put us in a position of glorification everybody with me now let's continue on and you'll see the rest of this story unfold and now I am no more in the world he was standing right there in the world breathing but he had moved into another dimension or another another place of he was praying this prayer for us all right but these are in the world and I come to thee in other words he's leaving Holy Father keep through thine own name which is who what's the name of the father Jesus Christ keep through Thine Own Name Look Those whom thou Hast given me now he's separated from the world right that's not talking about the whole world that's talking about his people his his K folks bride look that they may be one as we are one now if if he has took this and says all right thou H has given me these group of people and this group of people are going to be just like me he separated a whole group of people there's some that's not going to reach the statute of perfect man and be just like him they're going to be saved according to John 3:16 and he's laid that out but he's separated a group of people that they he come from them to they while I was with them in the world what now listen when he was how many people followed him when he was in the world 12 one of them was the devil everybody with me while I was with them in the world I kept them in thy name those that thou gavest me I have kept and none of them is lost but the son of predition that the scripture might be fulfilled now watch and now come I to thee I'm leaving and these things I speak while I'm in the world that they might have my joy fullfilled in themsel come on he's not talking about himself we're back to this scripture over here he's not going to speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak what through the bride and show you things to come that's where we're at now but watch oh not that far that they might have my joy what is his Joy it's his character his Joy is his character what is his character you're looking at it on a board that's his character that they might have my joy that they might have my potentials my attributes my virtues that's right that's right amen fulfilled in [Music] themsel now let's go to St John 17 same prayer he just keeps going he says sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth but now watch look and for their sake for their sake I sanctify myself that they also now we're back to the they again they also might be Sanctified through the truth now listen that does include sanctification before you're born again but that also if he you're going to be Sanctified through the truth there's your San San ification we're looking at right now anybody with me right there you've had your baby form sanctification you quit your smoking drinking you cussing you've quit all that down here right if you're still doing that you're not up here yet but if you've done all that and you you you do the things of God we make mistakes we know that for a fact but we don't do the things we used to do I hope not so this is the sanctifying down here of the Soul we were talking about the other day down here unclean Spirit goes out God can't dwell in unclean vessel Holy Ghost comes in seals you in and you are born again but you are not ad I mean you're not adopted you're in the line of adoption but you're not adopted you're a newborn baby in Christ Desiring the sin in milk of the word preach me the gospel tell me something about my salvation then we get to where now in John 17 he's saying hey now you got to be like me come on now you got to be like me and that's like him and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified what through the truth there's no other way that's why down through the church ages they couldn't get all the way out the prophet of God said because they didn't have all these virtues because they hung on some to their old to their old tradition are their own idea come on that's why we had to come back to water baptism name of the Lord Jesus Christ cuz the other one was not right we had to come back to no eternal hell cuz that other one was not right we had to come back to no Trinity Doctrine cuz that's what the truth is a trium being that's why we had to come back so that we could even start up the statue perfect man that's not even in the seals that's not even the son of man ministry right that's receiving the Holy Ghost and being a Christian this is being him remember you get a checkbook at the bottom of the pyramid you get a checkbook with his name written on it and when you write the check he verifies it and then he is the one that takes care of it when we get up to adoption he hands you the checkbook there's nothing on it you write the check and you sign your name watch this that they also might be Sanctified through the truth now so it's got to be the truth remember Jesus was standing speaking this word right here look at me speaking this word right here he was the truth there was no error in him there was no there was no thought of a trinity there was no thought of all these doctrines that's going around that was not in him the truth was in him sanctify them them through thy truth then he said before Thy word is truth am I getting somewhere you see where where he's do you see where he's just pulling this thing apart he said there's going to be a group that's going to believe on me they're going to be saved Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost and then they're just going to be a baby by their own choice but there'll be a group of people that's going to be just like me cuz remember Jesus started as a baby standing here he's 33 years old right he's a going man and for their sake I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth now watch verse 20 here's the separation look neither pray I for these alone so it looks like up here he he took a group of people and he separated them said they're going to be just like me now he says neither I pray for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word St John 3:16 or believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved but watch that they all may be one when we get to heaven yes there's going to be crowns and we're going to know brother Brown was a prophet cuz they know it now they're going to know that that maybe that brother Dell was a pastor the church and he took a group of people to The Headstone and and whatever you want to say and brother bisc and different ones right they're going to get their Crown they're going to get their reward but listen same Holy Ghost amen same Holy Ghost everybody gets the same Holy Ghost if you got the Holy Ghost all right so he said that they all may be one we're not going to get to heaven and go well now bless God you might have made it but I I got this in my house and I I got transparent walls so you can be able to see through it I did this right here I got I look look at where my star was no we're all born again we're all Brothers when we cross a curtain of time my precious brother that's all they said they didn't come up and say Hey Brother r i preacher mer message Right Down the Line no they were just glad they made it that they all may be one now look hold on as thou father art in me and I in thee that they there's that lay again that they also may be one in us so he brings it all back together that the world may believe that thou has sent me let me add just a little bit sorry I'm going to add to the word through them that's what he's saying cuz he says right here and the glory which thou Gest me I give to them no less the same that that they may be one even as we are one now I've covered this many times before he's standing there saying that we're going to be him if he said I and my father are one you and I are going to have to be able to say I am my father one that the glory which thou gavest me I have given them that they may be one as we're one i in them thou and me look that they may be made perfect that's the only way you're going to get perfect that's why we had to have the Prophet come to line it all back up as Elijah did at on Mount Carmel he put all them rocks back where they supposed to go he put everything back in order and then the fire fell they had to get everything back in order though cuz what the churches denominations 400 prophets had beat the thing up they kicked the rocks out they they you know it was a bloody mess cuz they cut theirself and all the other stuff what did they get out of that yeah nothing but all Elijah had to do was put everything back together and he said okay Lord I you told me to put the water around here every how many three pots or whatever many pots it was you told me to dig the D ditch and I've done everything at your word then the fire fell all right and consumed the sacrifice I and them thou and me that they may be perfect in one or complete and that the world may know now how's the world going to know through you that's right that thou has sent me and has loved them now watch love them as thou love me he's lying if we missed it somewhere so he's opened a door there's that door in John 17 he's opened the door he said all right there's going to be something in the world that's just going to believe on me and that's okay but then there's going to group be a group that's going to be perfected they're going to be just like me because they're going to be me listen without the Holy Ghost you can't be God but with the Holy Ghost you have a chance I said you have a chance cuz you're still a free moral agent everybody good with that I just I just thought man this is so wonderful that I I wanted to find somewhere where where Jesus just separated a whole bunch he separated right there in John 17 he let us know what we're supposed to be he let us know there'd be a group of people that would just believe on him but they would be a they and a them that would do more than just believe that they would yield their self and be that same person that walked on the earth called Jesus Christ all except the Healer and but I'm talking about where does healing come from comes from God but lay hands on the sick and they shall recover okay you didn't do it but there's a contact right couple water my name though we get to the other side you know white Throne judgment how's he going how's that person going to get eternal life through you listen Paul couldn't receive the Holy Ghost Cornelius couldn't receive the Holy Ghost until somebody with the Holy Ghost was there to give it to him yeah right right the seed life comes through the body prophets already told us that you got to have somebody you got to have a connection well that connection is who God somebody a god-filled man to lead us through that's right we don't put anything on the man y'all know that you understand what I'm saying but if the if all this is Jesus is saying all this through the world there I'm not going to be here but there's going to be a group of people that's going to show me in the world that's going to show me and we sometimes we look so ragtag and so horrible and pitiful but I'm like what brother Boyd said I when when a sister was singing the song how do they do without God how do you get up in the morning without God how do you get up like I was saying at the funeral if you if this is all we got we're in trouble if we'd be you know like somebody say you know it'd be we'd be people most miserable we'd be miserable group of people if that was the end no that was just the beginning it got brother how back to that place to where the Holy Ghost took him across and he's living in it right now he's living in that theophany waiting to come back here to get his body glorified everybody all right I mean I love the Lord when he when he just backs you up and shows you stuff and say well I was wondering I was I thought Lord there's got to be where you can tell the people you separated them out because most of the time he didn't now sure he separated the snakes and the Vipers and the year of your father the devil that was a group over here but when he was John 17 he wasn't sure he was dying for them you understand what I'm talking about but there only group of people going to believe him he died for all but only a certain amount of people are going to believe him right but there's going to be a certain amount of people like he said that's going to be one just like he was standing there him and the father was one they're going to stand on this Earth and be one just like him impossible yes without him but with him I'm going to take what he said I'm going to take what he said what he said 2,000 years ago so then brother random having the spirit of God having the prophetic in his soul just like come on just like Jesus he wasn't the prophet he was an a prophet but he had to come to bring a special message to hone it down so that we can say we was he talking about or was he talking about the Baptist or was talking much to mthod this no he said I'm not going to call you a church anymore the church the church get saved but the bride gets born again the bride has his potentials the bride has an ability to be adopted or an ability to you say well what are you talking about listen if you got the baptism of Holy Ghost there's got to be something inside of you pulling you up I want more I'm having a problem right here help me right here Lord but when that problem's over take me up a little higher take me up a little higher let me understand what brother Dell saying let me you understand what these brothers are saying that's right listen he'll have to lead you and guide you if truth is told to you he promised he would so now he's standing in spirit form he standing in a prophet he said now I'm going to call you bride I'm going back to St John 17 I'm going to tell you there's going to be a church there's going to be a bride that you'll understand because remember he's getting ready that's at the first seal right at the first of it he says look broken to who not to Christ but to the church and then he he kind of mumbles around he goes I I hope I mean you people I'm GNA call you bride all right so now let's go back and listen this is what he's this is what he was saying broken to whom not to not to Christ but to the bride it these seals will not be broke to the church church nominal and probably 90% of the people in the message but I'm going to call you bride I'm going to say he's talking to me giving me a chance to be able to understand not just that God sent a prophet so never since Jesus Christ was on the earth in St John 17 telling us what we're supposed to be telling us there'd be a group of people that would not get it all that'd be a group of people he would save because they just said' Lord save my soul' you died for me on the cross at Calvary and I give myself to you well praise God they'll be in heaven all right but there's a group though that's got Satan's answer that's a formid who was the most formidable opponent on Earth the one I just talking about so now if he said if he was the most formidable opponent that Satan had 2,000 years ago Jesus standing on Earth in flesh and he's praying for me and you to be just like him so the most formidable opponent on earth now is his bride cuz he's not here he's depending on us listen all the other Church ages are dependent on us cuz see let me tell you this when when Martin Luther when he passed away all right ever have any hundreds of years ago when he passed away he was a bride Church age messenger with a message people believe that message were called out of the age right but remember brother Ram said not all the way out cuz they kept a little bit of few doctrines they kept a few stones of stumbling that's all right everybody is that okay false Doctrine but stumbling stones but when he went across a curtain of time God didn't start throwing stuff at him he made it he said here's your place this is your place you were a church a messenger and these are your people cuz what happened to brother brandham when he went across a curtain of to he said oh these all Brams he said no they're your your converts Millions they're your converts they're not Paul's they're not irenius they're not Martin Luther Wesley they're yours when Luther went across a curtain of time he had to stay there cuz he didn't get to come back across the curtain he stayed over there but there was a group of people that I'm sure hugged his neck and said thank you for getting us out of that Catholic Church I believed your message for the day now I don't know where these other ones are but I know this is a safe place I know now see they didn't none of them know it was a sixth Dimension they just knew it was the place they went to we know that's why we can answer any question almost that's asked brother randam has just covered it all and we can go back and say no that's a sixth Dimension no they're not in the arms of Jesus no they're not walking on streets of gold come on somebody no they're Mama's not sitting at the feet of Jesus right now she's in a sixth Dimension an eternal place and they're sitting there I don't know they can sit on a rock whatever they want to sit on listen they can stand for 50,000 years it ain't going to matter but they're in a place waiting on a pull to get them out cuz remember they told brother bandam said look we're not complete here we don't eat and we don't drink but we're coming back to Earth with you wow guess who's going to guess who's going to be the one that opens the door not a church not many brides one one bride final voice not voices final voice to the final age under her messenger is the bride in the end time the St John 17 bride that he stood and in his infinite mind God infinite mind he saw us tonight reading that same scripture and knew somebody was going to come to that Perfection that Jesus prayed we'd all come to now listen Jesus prayed that's a pretty good prayer I'll take a prayer from Brother D any day but now Jesus trumps him okay I'll take a prayer from Jesus all right so he stood there and told me what I was going to be all right then he sent somebody like brother Dale to remind me of what was said all right remember Jesus didn't come to bring you your inheritance he came to get you back to your inheritance all right cuz your inheritance never was lost in eternity you can't lose something in eternity it got l lost when we got put in a pawn shop down here like I said Sunday this was all withheld he had to hold the book he couldn't send us down and and that's why I don't agree with the people that thinks that we come here with eternal life no way I want a hand no not that kind of hand I want a hand if you knew and I'm I'm serious you knew you were lost if you knew when you when you come through your life you knew you were lost well praise God the rest of y'all must be saved from the foundation of the world we are but you realized you were lost every one of us in this building some of you ought to realize you're still lost well I didn't say that but if we we were lost there's no way we can have eternal life inside of our soul God won't dwell in unclean vessel remember there's only God or Satan that's why I want to know where that seed was if we had some kind of seed in us where was it it cannot be in your soul and that's where it's supposed to be cuz when you get born again it's in your soul not in your spirit not in your body let's just realize we were all lost we needed Jesus Christ to come from Glory through some way of Salvation I'm saying for us to believe that way of Salvation to believe that he died for us and then the Holy Ghost comes in us as on the day of Pentecost listen why didn't on day of Pentecost why didn't just Peter just stand up and say we had it to begin with no Peter was the first one to stood up and said this is that that was told by by the prophet Joel that I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh he realized he was lost if there ever a person realized they was lost was Peter and then he realized he got saved got the Holy Ghost got the new birth all right so let's just put that away but those names could not be released me and Susan was talking about the other day listen there's no way we were individuals before you came on Earth only in the mind of God and it was a Jee pool of God sure he knows exactly but you and I even as fathers I didn't know I only had two kids inside of me but if I was a heavenly father that knew from beginning to end I'd know exactly how many kids I had and when they'd come how they'd come what n or day they'd get born again and I would give them eternal life and bring them into the family to me that's very simple all right not that we always was and we just realized brother R was a prophet listen Satan knew brother R was a prophet why did he Badger him all the time why' he fight them demons all the time like he said he did go back to a motel room and them demons bother him that he cast out in the in uh I was thinking about that folks listen I'm going to tell you something sometimes my dad gets in a state of torment and I think man devil you got to leave think of all the demons though that my dad's had to do cast out of us maybe not by land off hands but by the word of God that's the only way the the real that's the only way the real devil's going to get cast out is by the word of God not by shaking shouting speaking in tongues and all that other it's preaching the word of God and if somebody preaches the word of God it actually does it cast them out of me because I had a lot of different things going on in my life I don't know about y'all am I just the only one you CLE times you look at me like are you really that bad yes I was really that bad so were you but I thought I thought devil I talking about was yesterday when we put him in that new facility I said you devil I said you need to get away but if brother Bram had that problem remember he said he it would keep him up at night them demons would come into the motel room and torment him for casting them at being you know you cast a demon out where'd it go it went them swine it went somewhere brother R said you better keep your eyes closed he said that demon will come into you he said keep your eyes closed be reverent don't move around he said that demon of epilepsy number one he always talked about epilepsy was a was a real horrible demon and and you know what brother I mean Jesus had to deal with it too remember he come to them people and they said well your your um your 12 can't cast them out he was rolling around and frothing into mouth and falling in the fire and all that that's an epileptic fit Jesus said only by prayer and fasting can we cast these out there are some demons that are rough and there are some demons that are not too rough that's just the way I see it so let's pray for a pastor let's pray for all these preachers you don't know how many times you know you get up here and you and you and you speak and then you get home and you got a pound and headache or or something happens or or you just have a horrible Monday or something you know well it could be that there was a demon had to leave somebody by the preaching of the word of God and that demon was trying to find a place to go so he just come back and torments you I'm talking about all of you you think about it listen there's more going on in the spiritual world than you are in the natural world it's real busy in these other dimensions come on it's real busy we're we think we're busy they're busy 24/7 they don't get tired they just keep pounding and pounding and pounding all right so pray just pray for you pray for you preachers and Elders deacons all pray for everybody that that has a position in church cuz the devil hates us he hates us he don't even like us a little bit he hates us we hate him too but there's got to come one there's got to come a real bride in other words St John 17 has got to come into being in a bride in the end time and be Jesus Christ because the head stone is him complete right that's what we're heading toward and see look as it gets more narrow and narrow and narrow and narrow to a point there's listen in in just listen to me for a minute in in all of Christianity it started on the day of Pentecost First Church age right A lot of people less less less you said oh now we got 7 billion people well 8 billion now I think it went to 8 billion people on the Earth but how many real bride how many real bride not just churches not foolish virgin bride Born Again filled with the Holy Ghost Bride in the world right now I don't think they as many as there was when it wasn't many people on Earth but there's got to come one cuz brother Ram always talked about honing he always talked about you know the RoR The Razor's Edge the the cutting the the the the cutting away and all the different things like we were talking about the the two-edged sword that that divided the soul and the spirit and the body so in other words there must come one who's this one this one is them the them of John 17 is this one right here everybody with me see I don't want to be exclusive but God made us exclusive because he's going to have somebody that's going to be like him don't matter if it's two or three or four or one he's going to have somebody like him he made a way for it and he even prayed for us to get there why are we not there yet Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God now not not somebody not a preacher they can preach real good but the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword see even to the dividing aunder of Soul and Spirit and of the joints and Marrow so there's Soul spirit and where's your joint and Marrow in your body your flesh right so it's dividing those three up Paul says and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and we saw that through brother R's Ministry we've seen it several times here all right so now the soul of man is that Genesis 126 man you got to think back what we were talking about this this past weekend that is what I'm talking about that's that Genesis 1 126 man is that part of the them bride that's not foolish virgin that's not IM Isaiah Jeremiah Abraham it's only the redeemed the Born Again redeemed all right so you take that group of people and you put them in a place and you tell them say look you now have the divine power of God inside of your soul you are now a Christian you are now in line of adoption you're not adopted but you're in line because look according as his divine power and who is divine there's only one Divine there ain't a Divine person on Earth ex the bride you forgot her we can't forget the bride his divine power who Jesus Christ had given unto us oh so that divine power has been given to us has given unto us all all things that pertain on the life of godliness to the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises brother Ram said that by these promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature right having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust so we don't have to go to judgment the lust of the World by the new birth is not in your soul we could say something about that but I'm not going to say anything right now all right so the word divine means Theos which is the godhead of Christ spoken of the only and true God whatever can in any respect be likened to God now Jesus didn't liking us to God he said if we'll do what he says we be God right that we may be one as I and the father are one they be one all right Romans 8:14 for many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God in other words you receive the divine nature of God after the New Birth all right but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry daddy daddy Our Father father the spirit itself bearing witness with our spirit now look that we are the children of God there's come a time and place where you got to settle the settlement I am a child of God or I'm not all right cuz listen once you see that you're a child of God you get these promises of joint Airship with Christ cuz that's what Christ was doing in St John 17 he said look whatever I got give it to them but they will be a group that'll be Sanctified separate from that that'll get me and its fullness everybody with me if so be that we suffer with him so it's not going to be easy or even pretty had a girl today at work Kelly her hair's getting down about this long she said I just can't stand it when my hair touches my shoulders I said well June can stand when her hair touches the back of her leg at the bottom and I said sister Rachel y'all know her that's a little Rose girl that that that ships all that stuff hers touches the ground she's never cut her hair what I know y'all believe different no I said we believe the Bible I said we don't we don't worry about our sister don't worry about where their hair touches she was she was it was bothering her you because it was on her shoulder it never been that alone before so anyway but see that's the thought process of the world our thought process is sisters I know it's tough to do your hair not when it gets thin and when Jun was having her surgery and all I kind of washed her hair over the sink and stuff you know and I thought man it's like a Chia Pet you know in your hand but and and then like brother Donnie Reagan you know if if somebody out in the world you know somebody comes says oh man I got one of my wife's hairs and they go oh well no we're like nope I got one of my wife's hair stuck in my shirt yeah it's all for the it's all for what the Bible says all right I said I said Kelly the Bible tells you not to do it I said it's not me saying or our religion saying that the Bible tells you not to do that of course all them other women in the in the post office they head back toward the back and Kelly blessed her heart she's a she's a she's about a 2third contic Yankee she just stood there and took it the rest of them buddy they just go back and sit down in the in the kitchen back in the back wait till I get done then they come out why cuz it's condemnation you sisters when if somebody preaches and says it's Abomination for you to cut your hair now if you've never cut your hair you're like a ain't talking to me and there's no condemnation but if you've trimmed your hair you don't need a lot of discernment when you start talking about hair in the and go they go off in that little safe place praise the Lord anyhow you know you just tell the people say look I can see in the Bible where we're not supposed to show me where it says you can if you're and she's not even a Bible believer I mean she probably never even opened a the book they were Catholics she said Catholic by name so they were just name Catholics so she probably didn't even know where the Bible said that she wasn't supposed to do that so but still just just say hey we're doing what the Bible says I don't know whether you think we've got this awkward religion or this we're over here on this no Bible tells you not to do it and it's Abomination for you to do it tell me where somebody told you you could do it it had to be your denomination because it wasn't God all right and then they start on the dress thing you know well that's in the Old Testament well why you got the Ten Commandments in your yard that's Old Testament so anyway you got the devil's answer not calling him a devil but there's one inside of them if they're not born again you know that's really the devil speaking when when you when you get somebody upset and they're not they're not a Christian that's not them cuz any other time normally you're sitting there drinking coffee and talking to them but you start you you you bump that soul and give them a little condemnation the burner comes on it's not them cuz it's the same person that was sitting there laughing and talking to you about football or or hunting or whatever it is then all of a sudden you get on religion and when it ain't got nowhere to go it really is bad do like me chase them I'm going back to Kitchen next time we talk about that wherefore laying aside all malice all Gile and hypocrisy and enies and evil speaking look as a newborn baby so we should be getting rid of that stuff right there at the new birth as newborn babies desire the sincere milk of the word that we may grow thereby a baby depends on you to feed it right all right but now um um and that is good but you can't stay that way because you got you got to come to a place where you study for yourself you got to come to a place where you eat food when you need food am I making any sense you just got to look at your kid look at kids kids growing up they're just like I said you put lay a baby right here the baby will fall straight off in the floor but you put a cat here and a little baby cat will'll never do that it'll look down there but it'll never get off but that baby will just go fall why they're a newborn baby they've not developed even though they got a soul they're not developed well listen at the new birth you get the soul of God right you're not fully developed though and God knows that that's why he came and prayed that prayer he said hold them Lord keep them don't take them out of the world but keep them in the world but keep the world away from them in other words coming inside so God knows we're all going to start off his babies and listen he's your biggest cheerleader he he's your biggest cheerleader come on come on come on and not the devil as newborn babies desire in a sense of milk of the word that you look that you may grow now listen babies drink milk and they grow right but now 16 year old kid just drinking milk I don't know how that happen now you know what though that kid desires something else I didn't desire them peas mashed up all the time oh still don't Bo said still don't if so be look that ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious so you got to taste it you got to participate all right some of y'all ought to try that sometime to whom coming as unto a a living Stone disallowed of men but chosen of God and precious that's me and you all right where I think Pentecost fail brother R said look God gives him a checkbook that'll last him all through his life talking about look when a man is Born Again of the the spirit of God God gives him a checkbook that'll last him through his life's journey and at the bottom of each check has got Jesus's name on it and you just fill it out for whatever Redemptive blessing that you need it's yours already paid for now surely you're not afraid that it won't be cast if you're afraid you're just going to hold the book in your pocket in other words you're not going to claim your healing you're not going to claim your salvation all right so that's in the soul so now we're coming out to the spirit realm which is second Peter 1 ver5 and beside Bes this what in other words besides all this we've been talking about about the New Birth newborn babies in Christ and all that besides that look giving all diligence you know a little baby you take a little baby to a to a all you can eat buffet the best in the world let's just say it's the best place to eat food looks super I mean they got it laid out you can smell it right now I'm hungry but a baby just lays there and go bottle right that baby don't come in the door going wow all this food you way get us about uh I'm not going to say an Sarah but you wait a minute you let him get Luke's age thank you for being here Luke he gets Luke are are are Jonas's age and they're like Buffet wow can I have some of that and some of that and some of that some of that some of that that's like us when you're a newborn babe you're you have a narrow sense of what God is now am I not am I telling the truth when you get born again listen your whole nature part of you is contrary to God it is so contrary to God it's not of God until God comes inside but remember he goes through that developmental stage where he takes your Stony heart out and he gives you a new heart and he softens you up a little bit then when he gives you the Holy Ghost you're still sitting there going what's next what's next feed me Lord all right that's why coming to church is important you can believe it or not but you can't get fed at home you got to come to the buffet all right and you will if you're born again I like what brother darl Ward said he said you don't have to preach to Christians to get them to come to church cuz I want a buffet I come looking for something goody ribs steak I mean Deer Lodge Danny dear Lodge brother Danny right I'm inan a state that hangs over the plate like Murphy now we getting big time right there buddy that's a Capstone there's two good things in Oklahoma Murphy's and brother Claude and his church that's about it but if you desire the Sensei of milk of the word listen if you desire that it's going to take you to the buffet it's going to take you now whether you eat it or not you can go stand at that buffet and say man this looks good remember though you've got the check to pay for it it's already signed don't matter how much that Buffet cost Jesus signed it go get it right everybody with me but besides this giving all diligence in other words like I said as a baby a baby lays in the crib or you let it run around on the floor but when when Jonas or Luke goes in that Buffet line and and Zach black if he was here I can imagine him going through and and Michael brother Michael in a buffet line but when he was a little baby it didn't bother him but it was still there right the buffet was still there it was for the people that had become of age more and you know before that but here they come and they're going to be diligent about getting in line you better get out of the way right so that's the way we should be as Christians we should hey get out of my way remember my old football coach he said either lead follow or get out of the way don't stand in somebody's way if you can't get it if you can't go yourself and Lead get out of the way and let somebody go through there get in that Buffet line this word of God should mean more now to you than ever before if it doesn't something's wrong you're right malnourished if you're malnourished because of the word of God it's your fault you know where to get it and besides this besides New Birth besides starting coming to church and reading your Bible and praying to the Lord and the Lord answering your prayer and and and having faith that God will do things you got to add some things things to it right which would be virtue knowledge Temperance and that emanates out of your soul it's already in there it just emanates out of your soul into your spirit because your spirit realm didn't get the new birth no I wished I wished but it didn't there's the playground that's the battle listen the battle is not in your in your flesh excuse me the battle's not in your flesh the battle is in your mind your reasoning your conscious affs and Imagination that's where the realm that he's God is trying to get these virtues put in as brother Ry says the Lord goes into your door you allowed him in allow him into your room but you got doors that are closed and he won't go in them because he's timid he's a gentleman you've got to open the door and he calls them all out Pride selfishness all the different things that's contrary to this all right but what does he want to give you who wants to give you these all right right and to knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness to Godliness brotherly kindness to brotherly kindness charity Ephesians 4:14 say that we henceforth be no more children all right we get in the spirit realm we start up the statue of perfect man we will not be children if you're if you're climbing up that statue of perfect man you're not a child anymore all right look tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the glot of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lying weight to deceive preachers but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him look in all things there's a promise in all things which is the head even Christ 1 Peter 2 vers1 you also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also show is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a chief what a Chief Cornerstone down here corner Cornerstone not headstone Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be what confounded unto you therefore which believe he is precious but them which be disobedient the stone which the Builder disallowed the same is made the head of the corner which he tells where it's at but it's made a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense even to them which stumble look at the word why being disobedient I got a quote down here probably not going to get to it where brother R says bottom line is obedience obedience to the word of God I may try to get to that for we we'll get ready we'll get done here in just a second but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation of peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him that called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light now listen there's a group of people that did that first church AE second third fourth fifth six part of seventh they're gone already they can't Manifest this anymore they were a chosen generation but you and I are this part now we're alive we're Lively Stones yes which in times past were not a people but are now the people of God which had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy 1 Peter 1:22 says seeing you look seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit under unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed so you cannot get you can't grow in God with corruptible seed cuz listen God hates that stuff did he not say he hated the Deeds of nians and he said he hated it he didn't say he didn't like it he hated it being born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by what by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever Hebrews 5:10 says called of God and high priest after the order of MDC of whom we have so many things to say and hard to be uttered look seeing you are dull of hearing this is Paul talking to a con congregation and you think we're rough every once in a while you ain't listening you ain't getting this you're dull of hearing for when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God which is you must be born again and all that other that goes with it and I know I know for a fact there's no way that every church member is going to be born again I hate that but you have to go back to what brother Brown said he he said in every congregation that's why I don't like small congregations and I in them he said he says there's M Believers M Believers and unbelievers right in every congregation so if there's three people there but if they're there but listen if you're conscious of that if this is bothering you to come to church and listen to a message you need to get born again or need to grow you need to grow a little more say God I need to grow a little more I still say God and need listen we're going to actually ask God to grow a little more the day of the change right for when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God in other words we got to back up and talk about a new birth cuz we got new people come in then we going up a little higher then we have to back up a little bit cuz we got new people come in or somebody that's really hadn't been seeking it now seeking it but you have to discern that um through prayer and and U just watching people you can really see that and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that uses milk look is unskillful listen you get the checkbook with Jesus's name on it when you're born again but you are still unskillful or he would give it to you blank and you put your name on it so he makes sure that you don't make a real bad boo boo he gives you a check puts his name on it so he can back it up for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belongs to them that are of full age even those who by look by reason of use have their senses where are your senses you only got one in the middle you you're either born again or not you got five in the second realm senses and you got five out here having their senses exercised to discern both good and evil you have discernment to do that Ephesians 4 1:4 said according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love I I brother Dale broke this down years and years ago and I still got it in my Bible cuz look at this point of the journey you're not holy and you're not without blame but he says that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love that's what God saw before the foundation of the world then we had to come down here by predetermining or predestined Us by seeing by for knowledge that there would be a group of people that would come to adoption by Jesus Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will now brother Bri right here I guess we'll stop right here again musicians come on now what is adoption now let me get this now I don't know whether I won't have time to get through this and he keeps going he says look here's another time now you watch brother brandham brother brandham is a restorer of the word but being a Resto of the word he has to use the sword to divide I just read you Ephesians 4 rightly dividing the word of Truth Now look brother R says look your adoption is not your birth all right so he divided it right there your adoption is not your birth you can be born again and not come to adoption but you can't come to adoption without being born again all right you're in line you have the full potential to do it but you can stop it if you don't think you're your worst enemy then blame me thank you but you're your worst enemy I'm my worst enemy amen but your adoption is not your birth your adoption is your placing now we'll start talk we're going I've been trying to get this for two weeks but keep going back adding a piece I want you to see what your placing is cuz your adoption is your placing what does he mean by placing like chest pieces on a chest board we'll talk about that but we were predestinated to adoption all right look now look when you were born again St John 1:17 I believe when you are born again of the spirit of God we are the sons of God all right we're born again but we were predestinated now what we predestinated to adoption no other group no other age could come to adoption except this age let me read this real quick everybody stand now we went through second Peter 1 he's talking about the divine nature of God receiving the new birth is everybody with me receiving the the the the new birth and then besides this right add to your faith virtue knowledge temper patience now look now we're at this part this is the adoption part look for if these things be in you they weren't in you to begin with hello they weren't in you to begin with for if these things be in you and abound they make you they'll make you do things you really didn't do when you were a little kid they make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ look but he that lath these things is blind Christians there's no one worse than a blind Christian but he that lath these things is blind but where are you blind at you're blind by letting your memory reason conscious affection and Imagination take over that Faith that's supposed to be building up inside you that says hey I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me but he that lack at these things is blind look and cannot see it far off cut your Revelation right off and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sin wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence he said that three times in this verse one through about 12 give diligence to make your calling and election sure there's your placing we'll talk about it for if you do these things you shall never fall what a promise you shall never fall for as so an entrance shall be ministered unto you what through the gospel a door open unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things Peter says I'm I'm going to preach this and preach this and preach this and preach this and preach this and preach this I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in this present day truth this present day truth this today this present day truth you love the Lord let's sing a song [Music] and mercy shall fall me all the days all the days of my life surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the day all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever I will at the table spread for me brother Brown said and hear you himym 1960 that's where I was trying to get to talking about the chapbook he said the church has got to come to a place where it's disciplined that's the placing know your place stay in your place God God's Own that work right now discipline so we'll read that next time we preach follow me all the days all the days of my life surely goodness and mercy [Music] shall if you have a need all the all the days of my life listen we got long days a lot of us are all been in this message a long time about time for us to get ahead of something get to that headstone bring that headstone here it'll only come through you and me through and you surely goodness and mercy shall me all the days all the days of my life amen you love the Lord he's good to us he's good he's he's good to to give us good uh we have bad days I know as human beings but but as a Christian you should have a good day all the time amen somewhere in a trial there's got to be something that you realize hey this is for me I need this for some reason cuz I was telling somebody uh uh sister Audrey the other day I said God promised us he'd never put on us more than we can stand is that not is that Bible he said promised us he said I'll never put more on you than you can stand we just don't know how much we can stand until he does put us to a through a trial and we say oh I can stand that or if I can't stand it I better get some praying and some reading and some studying and some counseling and some talking and and talk to the master and and ask him hey where am I missing it at that's what I listen All Those Years brother Dale sat and I sat right there where Donnie's satting I'm like Lord put the pieces together for me put the pieces get it from me I'm selfish you can get it if you want to put the pieces together for me I was telling you U brother Harris was preaching here one night and I sitting there and I had a bunch of questions on predestination and he wasn't even preaching on predestination but he hit a little something about adoption or or predes predestined or something he said that word and I never had it happen before but I just looked up and right here a book opened and like it folded open and there was the whole forn knowledge predetermined predestined ation all down the line it was just it just come to me and written right straight out and put it every bit right straight together I never had that happen before but but when you do have that happen you know what that is that's that portal that opens up remember brother Dell told us he said when you get a revelation or you get something from God my children he said because God's real close God's real close right then if he's G you a revelation you sure know it ain't the devil so God's more prevalent right then than just say hey father why you in the house why you in the house why you here I need something I need my kids safe there's more going on in that Dimension than this Dimension but sometimes that Dimension kind of Breaks Loose a little bit and you get a revelation or God gives you something you go man like St John 17 I was saying today I thought now Lord there's something in here where you you pulled it apart and then you put it back together he said you like St John 17 right so I just flipped right to it and started reading it and I said well that's what Jesus stood there and praying you know I mean this is like like Daddy said you know he wasn't talking to the secretary he's talking to the father about me and you so now I can put my faith in that that it didn't get through a secretary that had two or three different meanings to it and that was his words praying for us his words knowing that a group of people would come to adoption that would come and would need that prayer that's why he prayed it he knew we'd need it he said save them Father keep them in the world but keep them Sanctified trust trust the Lord trust the Lord amen let's bow our heads Lord thank you so much for this night Lord we pray that you'd be with us we hope we've said something Lord to be pleasing to the people Lord I pray that you'd be with the ones that are not here that are sick Lord different things Lord I pray that you'd touch them Father just be with us Lord in continuation of this week Lord just bless this day Lord not just a 24-hour day but this is as John said the day of the Lord this is the day of us getting together and going home Lord learning our position and knowing what to do with that position Lord and staying in it Lord I pray that you just be with us now as we leave Lord just be with us on the highways be with the brother and and sister that's coming this weekend Lord and all the ones that are coming to the Bible study and different things Lord the prayer meeting father just be with brother George Quinn as he's coming in like the middle of next week but will be with us the next weekend Lord I pray that you just bless him now be with us as we go in Jesus name amen God bless you you're dismissed 500 all the days are my
