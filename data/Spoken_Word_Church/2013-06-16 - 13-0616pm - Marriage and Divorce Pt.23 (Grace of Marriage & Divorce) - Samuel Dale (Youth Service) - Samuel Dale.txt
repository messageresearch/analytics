this morning our brother brought just pray the Lord would bless them as they're traveling down to Florida and everything be with them amen if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn where we've been reading in Romans 7 but we also want to read in Zechariah 4 Romans 7 Zechariah 4 just remember these remember Wai June will be going away next weekend so remember that and pray that the Lord would bless them and all of the things and just pray the Lord would guide each and every one of us in his Loving Grace right right because that's what we need more than anything else is Grace amen amen Heavenly Father we thank you for your love and your understanding your guidance thank you for being you and Lord then by being you we can depend upon you to keep your word to do as you say you'll do and to honor your word because if we can bring the word before you the prophet said you're obligated to it so then we we just bring you that that too not you're not obligated to us you're just obligated to your word we thank you just have your way bless our brothers and sisters there as they travel down the highways take care of them Lord and give them a safe journey and father be with each and every one here be with the sick among us and Lord be with the sin sick and just reach down and touch each one of them have your way now guide us forgive our sins because we want to stand complete in you we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen Romans 7 and then we'll go into Zechariah know you not brethren for I speak to them that know the law how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth but the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loose from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulterous though she be married to another man wherefore my brethren you also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ yet you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God and when we were in the flesh the Motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in the newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter amen now let's go to Zechariah and we'll just start verse two Zechariah 4 the angel came to him there in verse one wakened him and said unto me what seest thou and I said said I have looked and behold a Candlestick of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps there own and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof so I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my Lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest not what these be and I said no my Lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubu saying not by P might nor by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord of hosts who art thou oh great Mountain before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth a headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it you may be SE the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've we spent quite a Time speaking about the new birth and remember what we've tried to bring out that in the invisible Union the message we've asked you to read that the prophet in it explains that Paul is not speaking here on uh marriage and divorce he's just illustrating his point that is really speaking on Law and Grace and we covered then that you know we must first have one thing and that was the New Birth all right see we can talk about marriag and divorce try to get free from this or free from that you know uh can we be free and and we've made that to be the basis of U the uh headstone own Grace you know and it is it's great it's Grace it's amazing grace but yet there is how things than to just see that our natural lives are set free because we must go on further into the message than that and it's great to find out that we''re set free but how can we be free if we're not born again that's right see the prophet said that that the marriage and divorce was to his followers only well now his followers is those with the new birth cuz that's the only ones that can follow him the rest of it can't follow because they'll go off somewhere and miss it somewhere see the most important thing then is first to know that we have the new birth all right so we spent uh about three or four Services speaking of the new birth and it was very I think very needful Maybe you know company came in and different things and I didn't drop back as much as you would think because you know uh I believe we need to understand the new birth because in that if we understand the new birth how the soul is set free right right and we can follow that thought of the setting free of the soul of mankind and it becoming so uh Eternal and and becoming so perfect and and totally justified and we can see that that you as a person can die to their s that's right and become born again and it sets that to that Soul totally free well then that is the key to me to understand the even the things of marriage and divorce is because if we can't believe that we're free then we're not free if we can't believe we have eternal life we don't have it right if we can't believe the New Birth has made us just as in Soul now just as perfect and just as Eternal as almighty God is amen that's right then you know if if we can't believe believe that then we're we're Bound by something amen and that's the thing that we'll get to the next message by which is the law right right you know the thoughts of mankind Not Just the Ten Commandment law somebody hearing that law is any word that we have to try to Bitter ourselves right or whatever you know trying to appease an Angry God to follow you know to follow a set of rules or regulations or thoughts It all becomes law right and in doing that then if we can't believe that the new birth makes our soul free how could we ever believe or comprehend think of it have any concept or thought whatsoever as to a body being set free all right and then if we can't get that right how can we comprehend us dying to the law and if you don't get nothing out of the message today I pray you get this point we saw in the messages of the new birth that that old first husband that adamic nature he must be dead not just put away and pick him up later or you know he said well brother Dale you know I wouldn't do that but see just lay him aside and then come back and flirt with him and do things you know see that would be deaths because we'd be proven we wouldn't Born Again amen but see he's got to be dead ever respect of him that's right he said but brother Dale I have problems yes well all right is we're in this world as long as we're here we're going to have problems that's right do you think you'll ever come to a place boy one of these days you come to place I just won't have no more problems I won't think nothing else wrong I want to you might as well forget it that's right cuzz that'll never take place amen I can there's a lot of things I can't guarantee but I can guarantee that one the devil's not going to let us we're going to fight to be free that's right amen you know you think about the greatest battle ever fought you think about the battles of the world has been fought for the freedom of mankind but see the greatest battle in the world of anything all the wars and battles is nothing compared to what we're fighting now that's right amen we're fighting ourselves right because that's our worst enemy that's right right and self- condemnation yes right is the worst enemy anybody could have that's right see you'll never be free as long as you keep condemning yourself you said well you you don't think ought to repent I agree we ought to repent I do every day prophet of God said do we sin he said every day he said I sin every day so but see we don't want to get down to those things and earn it all out we want to be told how good we are well that's wonderful you know that's good but somebody's got to make us realize we need something to make us good right maybe that's not the right way of saying it but all right somebody's got to let us know where we stand yes that's right CU we don't know where we stand we can't be set free that's right amen and the worst bondage we will get to it eventually the worst bondage was like those Pharisees yes as I tell you they said to Jesus we were never in bondage to no man right that's right and right at that time they were under the Roman government that was killing them that's right but you see they still thought we're free well that's good good it's a good to think like that but I'd rather look at something straight up and just face it yes you know CU running from your enemies will never settle especially when you're own when you are your own enemy that's right amen that's why you have people you know changes churches and things because they're trying to find a place that'll tell them they're okay you know and you keep on mov moving after a while you're going to find one that let you you know they tell you you're okay right right but yet what good would that have done in the days of Martin Luther right for him to a change and started another church you know started another Catholic you know there are what two two Catholics Orthodox and the other something you know ever what those are there's two different kind kind of Catholics Romans and everything else and uh would just move over to another place and I'm sure he had tried to do many things but one day God spoke to him and said that just shall live by faith amen all right that anchored in the man's heart that he could face the world with like I always say about in the upper room there they were scared to death one wondering what was going to take place but when that Holy Ghost came amen they were not afraid anymore right all was well they wouldn't no problems they was ready to die right for what they believed and you know what they believ that the day before the Holy Ghost came right but they wern't ready to die that's right that's right so it makes a lot of difference that's right you remember the prophet said on marriage and divorce he said it's got to be revealed to you right that if it's not revealed you don't have it that's right all right now what I want us to do today is to take and I may this quote basically what I want you to think about if they're fast enough to grab it up and run it then that's good but if not I'm not concerned because I I just want to talk to Lula this is to Lula this is this is me talking to you if somebody else is trying to uh listen in you know and and understand or whatever uh that's fine check the message out and see where it's true or not that's right right but if we can't take the new birth and see that we're free in our soul right right then we'll never be free that's right that's right in this life right right and then we would never see as I said we we gave it and over and over and over where the Prophet said that Romans 7 was a prophecy and said he's illustrating that this is not talking about marriage and divorce he's illustrating it then he gets into invisible Union and says this is a greater portion right so there's something greater than the the the natural Grace of marriage and divorce or that's a caral way of saying it CU All Things Are Spiritual you know what I'm talking about the literal things of Life yes and I've told you what I believed I've done this not because anybody's here that's come here whatever has done I've told you this forever since I've been in the message I said it back probably now over 40 years ago and I have nobody in reference you know as to say well it's you but I've said it over and over to you this is not something new I come up and say and and people don't like for me to be that way they think I'm offensive but if we have a marital problem of the flesh if that cannot be set free made right brought to a complete understanding I said it 40 years ago I say it again we're going to die and go by the grave that's right that's right amen well you sure are a carnal preacher I agree with you but that's what I believe 40 years ago or more I still believe it today amen because see I believe the Bible said he that the son has set free it's free indeed amen amen that's right right that's right but if we can't believe that it's for us that's right amen yes sir what good is it that's right it's good for everybody house maybe yes but if we can't believe it for ourselves amen and say well Lord I need that that's right I need so we go through serieses and things to show that we need it because of this this because of that you know we done this we done that in our lives to bring us to a place of understanding yes but yet somewhere it's got to become a reality amen right that's right sir and see as I said about Martin Luther it was revealed to him that the J shall live by faith you realize he knew that he would be automatically be ex communicated and in the Catholicism to be excommunicated is to be lost and die and go to hell not to just go to the Purgatory that the pope goes to and has to make his Whistle Stop and can come out the other end right Martin L Luther knew that if he was excommunicated they couldn't pray him out of hell that there wasn't enough money in the world to buy him out of it because it'd be contrary to the Catholicism and see when are we going to put our whole lives on something that's right oh brother D I've got my whole life in this message I I believe it well why do we still have our little thoughts and little ideas though that's right of some reason why yes well I've been a good person there's a lady down here on the side of the road going down on 51 uh we were talking to her one day and she said that preachers and everybody said she is going to go to heaven cuz she'd been good to people well and you think you could convince her that she wasn't going I think by now she's done deding went on I'm not certain but you know but you know she was well I've been good well that's wonderful but if you're not born again what good is your being good that's right that's a good neighbor it's a good person but you see then I make statements and people brother Dale you you're putting me to a position that I know I'm going to die if you are believing that you are going to die and go by the grave I'm trying to preach the truth that can set us free all right that's right but if we will not accept that okay and because of some statement somebody makes you will then become condemned well there was something wrong with your believing before I said that that's right I just exposed it that's right you've got to believe that you're free amen amen you got to believe that you're born again amen not that I'm born again not that brother random was born again amen you got to believe that you're born again that's right you got to believe the son has set you free that's right all right now so is it with the fact of this old second husband or second wife or whatever you do when you get into the marri marriage in the divorce situation and a lot of people will tell you bless God I'll show you that I've never been married before but was they ever engaged if there was is married would you see then all right my point is this flesh has us bound yes now what I mean by that is is long as we're in this flesh Paul says this flesh is carnal that's right sold under sin all right now how else can you say it the flesh without the spirit is dead we know that so it's really the spirit man right that's inside of us is our problem that's right that Soul can be totally perfectly pure by the new birth that's right and yet Satan still has an inroad into our spirit yes that's right right amen there is where our trouble is at is the spirit and the and the body is a display that's right right it makes manifest now let me make sure that that you understand what I said a minute ago cuz sometimes I say something and drop off and don't get it I have never said that it was impossible for you to go if you go by the grave because of a marital situation to not be in the bride of Christ I have never taught no such thing that's right I have never taught that you wouldn't raise in the resurrection and going in Rapture right what I've always said was that our our part that binds us to this earth if it's not set free by the word of God that's right the change in the moment the twinkle of an eye is not going to be done by us if we have a problem so we got to find a way yes to get that set free that's right he that knows the truth see the truth will set you free that's right amen well just don't tell me about it brother D don't know it well then you're not free that's right that's right right I mean you're not free you're saying I don't want to be free M but really what you're saying is you don't want to face reality you know of life like it is but we can't be free without the word why do you think it's message came right right amen that's right or it come to set you and I free and then if you you'll understand and keep reading invisible Union you'll go through that invisible Union book seeing that new birth yes and how that new birth makes makes you perfectly totally free makes you Justified yes amen which starts off saying you done it then you're forgiven that's right then it's as though you never done it right and then it's you never done it that's right now you got to the place yet to be able to say I never done it when everybody in the world knows you did that's right and you better believe the devil ain't gonna never let up on you telling you about how you done it that's right but what about a person that's what I was trying to get at to last message what about a person standing there with that new birth and that soul and that person is perfectly totally free Eternal but yet every nobody else knows what he's done but God don't know what he done that's right amen cuz God put it in his sea of forgetfulness amen amen he rised out your old record totally annihilated the record amen then to prove what he done he transferred your name that's right you remember that yes from The Book of Records that's right into the eternal life section all right and then when you see it that way you see that eternal life section was written before the world the Earthly life wasn't written before the world that wasn't written before the world but to eternal life was written there all right and until we're born again we have nothing to do with that eternal life section amen right right see because we don't even know about it that's right that's right amen right but see the new birth then can make us free amen amen all right but what I've tried to explain and I know some believe that well the new birth sets me free only in Soul amen that's right amen that's right yes sir and to prove that point I wrote a note for myself uh do you believe in asking the Lord to forgive you I mean after you're born again you know after you're born again do you ever ask the Lord to forgive you well if your soul set free why you asking him to forgive you because everybody around you knows you're guilty and you do too right I don't repent for what brother collie does he got to take care of his own part I repent for what I do all right see then that new birth doesn't do and that's what the point I want you to get for a little while and if we have to we'll pick this up Wednesday on a fman on it but the point I want you to see is if the new virus sets you free why did the prophet have to preach marriage and divorce amen right there was no need of preaching it he just tell you the new birth set you free but see the new birth only set the soul free amen right right that's right we get a new spirit yes but that's not taking your spirit out and putting another spirit in there that's right right it's just working on that thing amen and see in doing that then we're supposed to be controlled from the inside out so inside you're perfectly totally free amen but yet that's only part of the Plan of Redemption right so well I if I'm redeemed I'm redeemed well now all I want is scripture for it that's right you if the new birth set you free of your imin divorce and some of you heard it talk all right no problem it's just the fact that I just tell you I don't agree with it right all right but see we only get when we're borned again the new birth is only the earnest of of your inheritance right sir amen we don't call my new bir no Earnest well let's let the Bible call it that go ahead start brother ever who's on the stand today pull up number one which is Ephesians 1 yes sir 13:14 huh in whom you trusted after you heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise right now what is the holy spirit of Promise which is the earnest of our inheritance what until the Redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory right Jesus Christ paid for it that Calvary it's all done that's what your preachers preach right it's a good point but you know the Jews was redeemed at Calvary are they saved no he's not dealing with them that's right so then the Plan of Redemption is not complete that's right and one reason I know it's not I I'm looking at it and you're looking at it meaning us right right as long as we can see us you know that's right the Plan of Redemption is not finished that's why there had to be the seals to be brought to bring us the complete plan of Redemption right that even in the disciples the earnest of your inheritance is the new birth which is Faith right and they taught ver we need virtue knowledge Temperance fa godl brotherly kindness and holy spirit they taught it and that's what we need that's right all right now the new birth at the bottom of the pyramid is the earnest right that's right the new birth as the disciples had it was a fulfillment of a lot of things but it was not the ending of all things it was just bringing the person to the position to where we could start dealing with our spirit and body amen why would you need Temperance if everything went out of you and if it went out and you got the Holy Ghost you didn't need because he is the Holy Ghost you didn't need godliness cuz he is godliness but yet if we had what they had there it would still not be the Redemption of the body right this message come to finish the Plan of Redemption that's right amen which would first show us the new birth because it had to we had gotten so far away away from understanding what it was until we you know we thought it was shouting speaking in tongues crying doing this or doing that or whatever you know but see we had to be brought back to the face of the fathers yes that's right and I know that's offensive to people see we must come back to the faith of the fathers before we can even talk about the seals being broke that's right I know I've been offensive to people for making that statement but why not it's the truth I heard that problem first time man I understand all about them themselves yeah course a lot of people thinks he's wrong on all of it anyway so but listen the earnest of something is just a down payment amen you go down and you buy a house you put down the earnest money really all that does is gives you a right to live in it and pay for it that's right I mean just plain right you go buy your car you put down the earnest money you it just means you can park it in your house in the parking lot and make the payments on it if you stop making the payments on it they come and get it so it proves it don't belong to you right but see the earnest let's read a couple of what the prophet has to say on this is to where anybody out there that hasn't don't know it you'll know the prophet taught these things this is a message Called Moses preached in 1950 110 e29 he's talking about how he died for the purpose you know it's in the Plan of Redemption you were redeemed you're when you get to baptism with the Holy Spirit that's the earnest of your salvation is that right in other words it's a down payment and if it'll make me feel like that as a down payment what would it be see Divine Healing is a down payment or an Earnest of a change of a body right all right see Paul said then that we have the earnest of our inheritance until the what the purchase of the whole thing comes into view in other words a whole plan made manifest that's right all right look at the next one see you because you got an Earnest it doesn't mean you got all of it this is Jehovah Gyra preaching 57 paragraph E7 e67 and the blood of Jesus Christ has covered us covered and redeemed you from everything that Adam did now you don't have it in the fullness but you have it as an Earnest of your salvation what's see then to me now I don't care what you think and what you believe and how you can scream and holler you know it it doesn't impress me what impresses me is for you to speak to me about the word in the correct order see for you to blow up and bless God I'll tell you I'm born again why you blowing and huffing and puffing there something wrong reason you are that's right amen but you see that new birth you receive it doesn't redeem the body Jesus Jesus's body came out of this earth and the Holy Spirit come down to to redeem this Earth and redeem that portion he was standing in that's right but the the rest of it wasn't redeemed there only the portion he was living in that's right see then the new birth doesn't make your body and spirit free that's right it makes your soul free well I don't like the way you preach cuz you leave me bound you're only Bound by your own thinking that's right see then let's look at another scripture number four there brother while we at 1 Corinthians 6:18 I know I've got into trouble with this scripture but I still believe it I've had people to not want to take what is literally said Paul says flee fornication every sin that a man doeth is without the body but he that committed fornication sinth against his own body that's why if you you do something wrong between husband and wife you got to correct that cuz that's your body and see you sinned against your own body that's your body that's why you got to keep those things straight between husband and wife but look what it's saying every sin that a man doeth is without the body but he that committed fornication sinth against his own body see fornication is done by the body caused by the spirit of motivation right motivates it makes it do that's right that's why it's dire because now if we believe the Bible and believe the prophet see we can go into John yes we've been through that we' went through that and organized religion right the Bible says there in the John that he that is born of God does not commit sin and see we'd argue over what that commit means and you know practice it and do it you know we didn't keep on doing it and we just you know but you know that's why I love the way brother Brandon preached because he was honest enough to tell us that he was a sinner right and he had to repent get them big old theologians to admit that no they got their words right you know I just don't commit it well do you do it have you done it no no I I didn't do it well who done it then you know that would be like telling the judge your honor I didn't steal that set on a case in gains one time where I wouldn't on it sit and waiting on the other and this man said I didn't steal that car car your honor he said I just woke up and it was parked in my driveway and the guy said well what' you do he said I got in it and drove it downtown to try to find who it belonged to well that didn't work too good with a jury but you see that's the way we want to do it we get caught you know it's not a sin until you get caught is that the way we believe it you know is hidden until then but what about a prophet that would say we sin daily now I've had this discussion with people do we sin as a unit I'm born again Christian now a natural sinner with sin is a unit right Body Spirit and soul unit Body Spirit soul is all sin all right but when you're born again you're born again in your soul that's right right right so you can't sin anymore from th so who's the sinner who was the guy the prophet was saying we sin every day it's got to be the body and spirit of the person but if it's the soul doing it you're lost that's right all right that's the way the prophet's message divides things thank you Jesus the opening of the word right all right so then what I need to deal with on Redemption you know what do I need to deal with with on Redemption if my soul is eternal that's right what do I need to deal with I need to deal with this body and spirit man that's right right that's right and see that way then I've got to get that set free and if that man does something wrong you better repent because if you don't that's right the Bible says we're going to give a answer of the Deeds that are done that's right as a Christian that's right amen if we don't clean it up here we're going to face it somewhere else amen well see then it's not the soul that sinth that's what John says his seed remaineth in it and that seed of eternal life can't sin right that new birth can't sin right see that Soul can't sin right but I have to keep under subjection as Paul said my spirit and my body all right now then it was my body as we've just read that committed fornication cuz that's the part that does it that's right is the body motivated by the spirit you so well Born Again Christians can't do that well why did brother Brandon preached marriage and divorce right right he said true Christians married three or four times why right he said because of misinterpreted theology that's right because it wasn't taught we wasn't told not to do this or not do that I well remember in the days when we was told not to do a lot of time but they still couldn't get it I remember in the Baptist when a Baptist preacher if he had two wives he didn't preach in the Baptist Church right some of you remember that from the churches you was in then they started you know bringing them in breaking it down they didn't let them preach now they didn't know much about you know um engagements being weddings or something you know but yet they were straight enough to keep some things in line and his brother R said if it's good enough for Mom and Dad I think it's good enough for me and you you know if it's good enough to try to keep it in line there I think it's good enough to try to keep it now right but see why do we need the grace of marriage and divorce if everything went out at the new birth you see that's misinterpreted theology that's right that's someone's IDE idea that can't be proved by the word that's right all right brother Brandon said what we do invisible Union you remember reading this one he said we disassociate ourselves he said that's what mankind has done you can pull that up if you want to that's number 8 seven excuse me number seven we disassociate ourselves and we separate people that's right the marriage and divorce is the biggest separation that there is in the world you know because people have their ways of thinking their ideas and there so much even into this message even after the prophet taught it and he says we disassociate ourselves we separate people what are you separating them from come on what's he talking about what are you separating people from the revealed word I don't go for Lula brother Dale just an intellectual we think he's a fine brother he's a good guy and all I that but you you just can't understand him cuz he's an intellectual see that's all takes right now you say but brother Dale now watch this one we disassociate people from the word amen or we separate them and see we'd say but but I never you know I never heard nothing like this taught on until I come to Lula you know about marriage and divorce well that's what I'm talking about that's why we that's how we've been disassociated because we haven't been told the truth that's right amen right right we had no problems because it had not been exposed it's kind of like Jesus with the Pharisees when he said if I had spoke to you you had a cloak but he said now that I spoke you don't have any covering right you've heard brother and say well I didn't know that he said you know it now see we disassociate ourselves from the word through our Traditions our denominations right it separated us from the word of God Amen but I never heard none of them teach on it that is what I'm talking about right that's the problem right we have been pushed so far away from the reveal word right until it's hard to even talk to people about it because the way the mindset is see like I was talking about Wednesday that old husband around and saids got to be dead that's right what do you mean Brother D I just believed and and I think I can just stay right here in my church I can serve God here I know that you've told us this was denominationalism is wrong but said see I've had people to talk talk to me like that I I'll stay there and see if I can lead them to the Lord and then they'll throw it back in your face see oh didn't you do that yeah I did too cuz I just like the rest of us I just like all of us I thought I could win the church over you know that Martin Luther did not want to leave the Catholic church that's his own writings he wanted to convert the church y the Bible says they'll take your words and ring you with it people can remember good but now listen if in the marriage and if in the new birth that old husband must be dead right to be married to Christ that's right well then can't you see in the marriage and divorce situation the natural you know the literal what you want to call it the things of life if that's not dead then we're going to have to face it somewhere see right amen well don't matter me as long as I get to heaven that's that's good thinking but I thought Paul said if you were striving for the Mastery or what is that word you know strive for the best that's right right that's right why you want to settle by going by the grave right right when you can believe God and stand there and be changed in a moment the twinkl of an ey if you can believe it right amen see some people you know in our doings we done a lot of things while we were in in the world you know and that binds us to a position or a place or a problem and then we find a message that can set us free that's right now I'm going to put it here and then I'll keep on I'll try to preach on it if I don't get there we'll cover up to it I believe just like the new birth that the grace of almighty God come down and set that Soul perfectly totally free from all sin made it Eternal just as Eternal as God is because he got God's own life and just as Justified as God is amen amen and you remember justified in The Invisible Union do you never done it that's right now that was in God's book that was recorded that we done it but then the lounge book of life is when your name's transferred and see to do that your old husband's got to be dead all right now the only way in the marriage and divorce situation if you got one is that that partner husband or wife cuz we dealing boys that person you were married to before Paul says if they're dead you're free and Corinthians says you're free to marry only in the Lord you know cuz you can't go out and jump and do problem but if the husband Paul said is dead the woman's free to marry again but if he's still alive you got two husbands or two wives cuz we're covering it both ways cuz we're getting into the marriage and divorce situation right and see then in indivisual Union he said you can be forgiven a woman you know whatever a man you can be forgiven but said you can never be justified right CU you done it now as I said moment ago you know you know that people you do you think this way I hope you consider my point people would tell you with those people L they're good people but we just don't believe like they believe they believe a prophet Etc you know but they're good people they say that but they say well there ain't no different than we are you say well the people at Lula's born again but they're not now go convince them of that I'm having trouble at Lula convincing some people that they're not born again amen that's right you say you talking about me why you asking the question don't raise your hand if you don't want you know brother Mo sitting there in the military he said they'd be crawling out through there firing over the top of them long you don't raise your head up you don't get shot right not my fault you jump up right right but now think about it the people around you see you as no different than they are that's right you know what I mean they they know you hire you dress you close and we're fanatical and we believe a prophet came Etc but in finality they look at you just like like that well you're Christians just like we are right right and they don't see that you have the new birth cuz they believe they do too and the thing of what I'm getting at they can always say you remember when you say well brothers or something I I'm in the Lord I'm perfect you remember what you used to do you remember when you went over to you know what you done a can still remember it but what about a god it can't that's right amen right I've always believed it I always said try to explain it if you do wrong and you say well Lord I'm sorry he puts that in to see if his forgetfulness he'll never remind you of that that's right so if something keeps reminding you of things you done you ought to remember it's not the Lord that's right amen right that's right you to remember it's the devil reminding you that's right amen cu the Lord says I don't see it when I get up into the marital situation of life you know of doing wrong and married two or three times or whatever you see one the prophet said you can be forgiven but never Justified because they're going to tell you they're going to remember you go down to the courthouse there's two records down there we remember when you got married we know you've been married to this woman you've been married to that woman but my point today if you don't get nothing else I believe that's what's holding off the Rapture the change amen is the fact that we are listening to what they say about us our memory reason conscience affections Etc is remembering all of those things that we done that's right and we're not dealing with trying to say Lord Set Me Free that's right that's why I've always said you know we pick on the women all the time we preach against the girls all the time we don't preach against the boys you know better than that here Paul says a man's got a virginity just as well as a woman's got a virginity and he'll answer for that right we think it's okay for the boy to go do it the prophet said he could but she can't what did he say he could I spent whole services on one thing he can put her away but she can't put him away right how was it he could put her away only one way and marry again and be right there was only one way that's right and that was the Matthew that we read put away his wife except it be for fornication and marry another amen so everybody said well it's the prophet said he can he can't but do it for that one thing now I want that in the scriptures and I want in the prophet's message to show me where you can put them away for man can put away his wife for any other reason that goes on internet that's open to the world well see we just quote that for what do you mean I know I done this but he said we could but you can't don't work I'm sorry but listen compare the new birth as the grace that is given unto you and I that's right come on are are are we saved by grace through faith yes we're not saved through faith we're saved by Grace right through faith amen amen now comparing that new birth saved by grace through faith and going through what we went they brother R said God let that old husband die right see because we can't kill him that's right we try to kill him it just means a divorce I mean really is that truthfully we try to do it it's just he'll jump right back up but he let it die now some were then with a marital problem you married before whatever now if we can compare that with a new birth then we've got to realize somewhere that God let that old wife or husband right die yes and they're still living right are you with me yes now when you was born again he let that old husband die right that nature yes did that stop the world from having that nature did that stop the neighbor or did it stop your wife if you got born again did that stop your wife from having that nature no did it stop the kids from having it did it stop anybody else from having that nature besides you that's right so as I said a moment ago they can still remember all we do and so can we and so will the devil keep reminding you what you do amen amen but see I believe somebody's going to come under the grace of marriage and divorce that they're going to see grace that's right and there truly going to be Grace Grace as we read in Zechariah that's right that we can be totally free and that old husband that old wife just paraphrasing the point for marriage and divorce is so dead until God don't count it no more and yet they're living next door to you or something you know you know what it means they're still alive they're still out there doing they're still going right and they're still saying that was my wife at one time or that was my husband you know we're going to have to get to the place that we can say that God says he's dead cuz he said he's dead that's right amen that's right or she's dead whether it be man or woman whatever that's right if we can't realize that then we're not free that's right you mean God let all of them old things that I done he let that die yes yes yes cuz he's the only one that could that's right amen and see being the only one that could do it then he's got to let this of the grace of marriage and divorce let it be to the basis that he can let it die that's right well I just don't see how that can be done within you can't never be set free that's right amen and if you can't believe it's for you it's not that's right if you believe it's for others yes yes yeah don't do you a bit of good you believe it's for you that's right yeah but look what I done as I've always said I've never read anywhere that a marital situation was blaspheming was blaspheming the Holy Ghost have you but if we don't accept it because of some idea that man has put in our head that's right right then we're cutting our own selves off amen we're refusing to accept God's grace that's right that's the same as a man with a pardon without a pardon that's right amen it's not one unless it's received as a pardon that's right it's no good that's right see to compare the things of the new birth and compare it with marital lives we can look and see there's a possibility there's a possibility that's right see the new birth is the foundation right for coming to the understanding that's right and that brings a possibility to where we could be set free right right amen see the only way you can get the new birth is for that old husband to die see then there's the only way to be set from free from husband wife Etc situation of marriage and divorce is we got to realize that other person's dead that's right now I told you it wouldn't do no good to go out and shoot him right like you murderer a problem but what about living next door to somebody or something and seeing them every day and but yet God can let that die now come on as I said the other day brother Tom was referring to it you shave that old boy you ladies fix that old fell up all the time you know right you know he's still alive everybody in the world knows he's still alive God says he's dead the problem is we don't say what God says that's right that's right see God is the only one that can let it die yes and not kill the person that is in right that's MH you understand what I mean yes that husband that wife situation walking right on down the road and maybe you're even paying child support and having to mail it to them or or whatever you know and yet God can say it's gone you so well brother Dale it really would be a revelation with but you see we can't do that by holding on to The Telltale parts and signs that's right you know what are you tell me to do not speak to that person no more a don't be silly that's right I hope I'm not that carnal I hope you understand what I'm talking about if not you're that carnal that's right amen God let it die that's right God let that nature that world die that nature of that world is still out here doing everything and he's still working through my body and my spirit right and you may think he's not in yours I just tell you up front there's something wrong with you that's right he's done got you's reason no problems with him that's right amen all right see if God says it's gone why can't we say it's gone Paul said I'm dead is that right that's right the life that I now live in the flesh okay I live by the faith of the Son of God you see we we we can't move into receiving our freedom you know because there too much memory too much of ourselves that's involved in the memory phases of our life that's right and Satan can talk to us in there that's right but you know he could talk to Jesus there and did but he said just get on behind me right right brother brandom said the reason we can be you've been in invisible Union reading it he said that old husband's got to be dead said we've got to be Washed by the Water of the word that's right he said not by the water of the church now that's right that's right he said but Washed by the Water of the word yes he said then our name has been transferred well I don't understand brother R said that's where you won't understand the two books okay he said which is not two books but is one book amen and one book leads out out to the other one he said so this Bible tells of the Apostle Paul and how he was killing the Christians then it leads out to the road to Damascus and Paul died and he come forth as a born again Christian amen mhm so his name was transferred he said well what other word could you use brother Dale to express that well and know I know that transferred seemed like it's taken out and rubbed out put over this way why not just take it this way there's got to come a time where we can look at her old past and her old deeds in life and realize he gone that's right and look into God's word to see ourselves that's right as God sees us that's right he told Israel he said you're the apple of my eye he told bam when he was trying to curse Israel I see no sin amen right right Bam could say now wait a minute Lord the Lord had say bam you don't have to explain it to me I know your whole story but I don't see them they've got the atonement right amen right right but see if we can see that we have our life is not just say cut out here and put over here transferred why not just realize it's written there that's right wouldn't that be the best way to say it instead of transferring it to just come in this life and realize that's right by the new birth that my name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world Amen and I'm now proving it yes by the way that I live and the what that I do amen and F in this word see human terminology sometime it's confusing to where that it's you know and then simple terminology is correct and my wife we were talking the other day about the book and she made a good point she said y'all talk about the book said I never could realize what the book he talking about he said until one day and I hope I get the point to correct directly worship he said one day I realized that Adam didn't have a book but he was supposed to brought forth the human race we said he just didn't do it right he brought it forth in sin which started the other book to be written you know the record right it wouldn't have been no book you know it wouldn't have been a book If it hadn't been for sin amen see Church do we know and realize brother BR says it three times I'm pretty sure in invisible Union that he said God let it die that's right he said them old denominations is dead we'll get to that one when we get into the to that old husband am cuz you see what's wrong with us now is misinterpreted theology by denominationalism that's right and it's causing us to not be able to be free right of what we've been taught amen Amen brother randam gets kind of down to the end of the invisible Union and he says to find a place to realize that we're dead to them old husbands now I'm going to make a statement cuz I got to clarify it way on down the road but I'll make it now I believe it's worse to be married to organized religion and won't line up you know it confess the truth and see it and stay in what we've been taught than it is to be married a half a dozen times literally you might not agree with that that's all right that's just me that's the way I think I don't think brother brandham had a maracal problem in his life do you no no but I think brother randam was married to organized religion just like you and I that's right that's going to go over good you want quotes he said I cared a Baptist Bible and converted them to a Baptist Faith that's right but see that we don't want it that way you say Brother D are you saying I'm saying in this for later year down the road probably about 6 months from now one of these days we're going to have to realize that marriage and divorce is that middle stage you got the new birth and then you got the marriage and divorce and then you got your law and Grace okay and that's what's holding us here okay that's right is what we've been taught that's right amen he said we're in this problem with marriage and divorce because of misinterpreted theology okay that's right people never taught us it was wrong to do these things that's right where did you ever hear it Tau it was wrong to do no well they didn't never well that's the problem they didn't never teach us but I want to go down to number 19 and we'll just read it it's take on Christ revealing his own word if you can get down to that one pretty fast and just listen to what the prophet had to say about marriage and in divorce yes Christ revealing his own word yeah 1965 822 and by the way people listening in these tapes some are so many sends in said why in the Mar in the marriage and divorce you said this and you said that I said that so many many times these tapes are only I'm speaking to my congregation brother I'm not responsible for what God give you to Shepherd I'm responsible for what kind of food I feed these people this is for this Tabernacle only and now if the people want to listen to the Tes that's up to them but I'm speaking to what God has given me it was their sins that was omitted that's what they accused him of saying right and he admits it you said no that's just him coming down here and coming back to his thought and he said it's them saying their sins were that's that me that's that mind read it what happened he said people hugging each other their sins he said this is to my people only you get a revelation from God and do what you want to what you doing he said it was their sins that was remitted if you'll read in marriage and divorce you'll find brother brand would say Moses found his people in that condition God granted a right of divorcement and counted it righteousness he said Paul in his day and said would not he come in this last days to us CU you see I believe that's what's binding us to this world Amen is our spirit and our body that's right right amen because if we're allowing it to keep control of us that's right as I say and I said to start with don't think you'll ever become a zombie ain't going to do that going to do that no don't look eyes go straight no won't do no good same old brain is thinking going that way as it is looking that way the best thing to do is just say Lord forgive me amen that's it Lord forgive me help me you let that die sir as you let that nature of the world die in my soul but yet I still love to hunt and fish and right I said let that old nature of that world die right you see Church what I'm trying to say is one thing there was a lot of people done things before they come into the message that puts a person in a level that gives a understanding or a hope there because they didn't know and then they can read the marriage and divorce and receive what the prophet has to say some come along later and done things after coming into the message the in problems we see everybody's going to have to answer theirselves cuz I don't have an answer for nobody I have a a thing to let you know one thing if God will set you free you're free you got to talk to him to find out if you're free that's right you got to discuss it to him with him to see no preacher's words can't set you free that's right well brother brandom told me I was okay that's all right like people say brother around and said he saw me there another brother come up you know we're all smart in our brains and he come up and said he was in hell and he was in heaven said now where did he see you at and that's true but you see Church we've been disassociated from the revealed word of God by organized religion that's right and that's the reason of the married two or three times that's right that's why I tell everybody you go to God for that that's right you talk to God about your life amen I I I can't answer questions because I don't know brother brandham had the discernment he could stand and say why did you leave this out of your story I don't have that so don't come to me and say brother Dale do you think I'm free I'm I'm going to ask you a simple question do you think you're free that's right I'm not going to ask you are you born again you're going to tell me you are but I will tell you what we do in life about the new birth or about marriage and divorce will prove prove what we are you run off all upset at me because of some things that I've said about marriage and divorce and things then that's your problem that's your that's right but you remember one thing you're going to be running from somebody who tried to tell you the truth so then that means you're going to be leaving the word and you're going to be disassociating yourself from the truth amen now brother Dale don't talk like that a lot of times but I think that ought to be said yes but you see if you can't believe you're free you can't be free that's my mama told me I was all right I'm sorry my mama wasn't God that's right that's right I don't think your are either right nor your daddy nor your pastor your whatever you're talking about that's why I don't tell nobody you ask me what I think about you I'll say well what do you think about you because it's not what I think it's between you and God that's right amen the grace of marriage and divorce if you will not receive it it is not for you but if you can receive it it was their sins was the last quote it was their sins that was remitted right see it calvary sin was remitted but one day it was applied right and then when we can receive it and let it be applied we can say I'm free right well until then what do we do I made a statement here a while back I only told my wife about it I made it deliberately brother BR says on marriage and divorce go on As You Are he doesn't say on marriage and divorce that I explained all these things he didn't explain them he just says go on as you are God has made a way before like this right but see when he comes over here and he says it was their sins that was remitted when he gets invisible union he realiz is what marriage and divorce has done and if God can let that old husband or that old wife die and we can be free I ain't never have none of them troubles sorry praise God there are people like that but that's where we we going to move up into the law and Grace now and we're going to find out that everybody's guilty right we're going to talk about an apostle Paul that was guilty and God made free we're going to talk about a William brandham that was guilty and God made him free amen and then you're going to realize one of these days why Hebrews 11:40 says what what it says that they without us cannot be complete God's waiting on somebody that can believe what he says I believe that I kind of like what one of the disciples said one day or something said help thou my unbelief that's right help me Lord you can get enough believing in me that I can receive it but you got a marital problem you've been married twice or this that or the other what good does it do to try to go back and tear up old records and rip them up and do this that or the other why don't you just believe what he said going as you are that's right I didn't mean go home with four wives uh-uh they went home with the one they got you take Paul in his day what about a Grace you think a man that was under a time of that polygamy was legal with Apostle Paul in that time it was still there and there's Paul talking to a man that's got a half a dozen wives what's he going to do well go home with all your wives and have kids and ra no oh no no he's born again he's got to have the mind of Christ that's right I told you about it which he told it here brother Theo arasmus and them when they was in Africa there and those people that were living together underground and didn't know who was the daddy of what just living together just you know in a communal thing well they wanted to be Christians and they started wanting to receive the Lord and getting baptized and now what would you do with that and I thought that man had wisdom he said you get it all straightened out and said we come up our one day and said okay who is your wife well I got three of of them no no no no no you pick you one that's your wife what would you do but I put on it a little bit more than what they said they done and they done that and they just had a communal wedding you know all of you know at a wedding I put a little more on that my point is Paul what would you do Paul says which one is your wife that one Paul would tell that person you're going to feed that other family and you going to take care of them other women if you going to claim to be a Christian that's right he said well how do you know that well I don't know how do you know it ain't right what would you do I certainly wouldn't tell him to throw them all out and say you get you a wife and you better not flirt with one of them others or think about it but you going to feed that other ones and you're going to feed them kids that's true he said you just too tough y people don't like my ways of doing I'm sorry but I think it's pretty good rules that's right you know right what would you do see CU all things has got to be made right somewhere that's true and we as Christians ought to be that's right come on Brothers but if you can accept the grace of marriage and divorce it's for you if you can't it's not so it's not whether or not I tell you or anybody tells you right it's whether or not you can believe it the grace of marriage and divorce crying Grace Grace why do we not want to be right amen and be straight but you see we all got that little thing you know I get into it when I try to explain it but women will say well it's just hard living alone well Paul said if you just commit yourself to the Lord that he would take care of of everything and you ain't got a husband to put up with but women will say I just can't live alone then they go marry somebody and they can't live with them it doesn't look sensible does it we try to
