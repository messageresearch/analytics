[8:45] you know that's always a memorable time
[8:47] and brother Donnie there got to come out
[8:49] and and big old motor homes made their
[8:51] way all the way out there and back and
[8:54] we had a wonderful time let's read our
[8:56] scripture while you're standing and and
[8:58] just Genesis 12 now the Lord had said
[9:01] unto
[9:03] Abram get thee out of thy country and
[9:06] from thy Kindred and from thy Father's
[9:08] House unto a land that I will show thee
[9:12] right and our text is right there in
[9:14] verse two and I will you got to remember
[9:16] the part of that I will make of thee a
[9:19] great nation we're going to talk about a
[9:21] great nation a little bit this morning
[9:22] the steps that Abraham went through to
[9:25] fulfill this I will make of thee a great
[9:28] nation and I will bless thee and I will
[9:30] make thy name great and thou shalt be a
[9:32] blessing and I will bless them that
[9:34] bless thee and curse him that curseth
[9:37] thee and in thee shall all families of
[9:39] the earth be blessed in verse four so
[9:42] Abram departed just like that so Abram
[9:46] departed as the Lord had spoken unto him
[9:49] now there's a quote I want him to put up
[9:51] out of the Easter seal before we pray
[9:53] and and as we read this quote I want you
[9:55] to think about Abraham it's down in that
[9:57] second part where brother brandham talks
[10:00] about there he says now let me my my
[10:05] sister my brother let me say to you in
[10:07] Godly fear knowing that I may never live
[10:10] to see an Easter again but there's one
[10:12] thing sure you want a sure thing from
[10:14] Brother brand here it is y when a
[10:16] genuine for ordained Son of God by the
[10:20] word of God hears that voice of God
[10:23] right he'll rise and go to meet it
[10:25] that's right that's right now not
[10:27] everybody is going to rise and go to
[10:28] meet that
[10:29] they let's qualify that again when a
[10:33] genuine for ordained Son of God by the
[10:37] word of God hears that voice of God
[10:39] he'll rise and go to meet it how many
[10:42] believe Abraham started us on that way
[10:44] because the Lord said get thee out and
[10:46] Abraham just got out that's too easy
[10:49] isn't it it's the potentials that he's
[10:52] going to meet the real living word amen
[10:55] let's pray Heavenly Father this morning
[10:56] it's so good to see the house full and
[10:59] all these people coming out to worship
[11:01] you and to to sit under the word these
[11:03] few minutes we pray you'll bless them
[11:05] you'll encourage our hearts their hearts
[11:08] encourage the the the minds of the
[11:10] people to continue steadfastly looking
[11:13] into the things of God progressing along
[11:16] moving on the journey just as Abraham
[11:18] did and we pray this morning Lord that
[11:20] the things we say knowing it's their
[11:22] their time what they call a Sunday
[11:24] school lesson and a a time for beginning
[11:26] to look into the word we pray that we'll
[11:28] have something that'll that that'll
[11:30] quicken in their hearts and minds and
[11:32] give them courage for the journey ahead
[11:34] cuz it's been a long journey already
[11:35] it's been a tiring Journey sometimes we
[11:38] think the people are just tired and and
[11:40] and we understand that but we pray Lord
[11:43] to yes today that you'll just bless us
[11:45] in your name amen amen God bless you you
[11:47] may be seated it's all right because of
[11:50] warmth I'll just take my coat off right
[11:52] away
[11:53] and and El but yeah it's good to be here
[11:57] it's been like what 7 months now now we
[11:59] were here at new years's and so all of
[12:02] you that are continuing the journey here
[12:04] we just we just appreciate you being
[12:06] here and being out this morning we trust
[12:08] the Lord will help us help us in our in
[12:11] our text today
[12:14] amen of course nobody is more enjoyable
[12:18] to preach on than Abraham I
[12:21] mean he's just it it's not only easy
[12:25] because brother brandham has already
[12:26] told us so many things about him but
[12:29] it's just a joy to preach on our Father
[12:33] Abraham and this quote way down in
[12:37] 1965 just matched up to those verses so
[12:40] well in Genesis 12 that I had to read
[12:42] the two together right because as we as
[12:46] we're going to look and some of the
[12:47] things we'll quote and say from Brother
[12:49] bram's message will'll be very familiar
[12:51] to you but Abraham was just an ordinary
[12:55] man and you'll see that in a few I many
[12:57] remember brother BR telling us that over
[12:59] and over and over there was some things
[13:01] that we had to learn about Abraham or as
[13:03] he was known as Abram here in Genesis
[13:06] 12 that that helped us on the journey
[13:09] but let me say again brother Pinkston
[13:11] texted me a little bit ago while I was
[13:12] back there and said said to make sure to
[13:15] greet you all I know he's been out here
[13:16] with you before and and and like I said
[13:19] we get enough of y'all coming our way
[13:21] now to to keep us mindful of who you are
[13:24] and and we have good Fellowship I I I I
[13:27] do have to stick a fork and I my brother
[13:30] waited here every once in a while to
[13:32] make sure he still he still treats me
[13:34] right we just he come to my house and he
[13:37] just he was just there at my house
[13:39] that's all I can say you know we we sure
[13:42] enjoyed having him out and got to put
[13:43] him up in my home and that that was just
[13:45] a real blessing they they take care of
[13:47] us well so y'all y'all got some Fine
[13:50] Brothers Here leading the church and
[13:52] helping you in the word of God and we
[13:54] appreciate that and we appreciate yall
[13:56] being here this morning but but we're
[13:58] going to quickly look and I know it's a
[13:59] morning and and I've never had a a 10:00
[14:02] and then a 2:00 service so this is new
[14:05] for me so y'all are used to that but I
[14:08] man I've heard so many things are going
[14:09] to happen this afternoon I I didn't
[14:11] write them down I'm going to get them
[14:12] out of
[14:13] order I mean I'll be up there at to
[14:15] baptism and y'all will be having a baby
[14:16] shower down here at the church so so I'm
[14:19] going to have to follow because I I they
[14:21] they gave it all to me in one big lump
[14:23] package and now I don't know what I'm
[14:25] supposed so y'all just if you see me
[14:26] wandering around aimlessly not knowing
[14:28] what's going on then you'll understand
[14:30] it that was just too much information
[14:32] for an old guy like me at one time so so
[14:35] y'all just follow along help help me
[14:37] preach this morning help me get through
[14:39] this and then hopefully we'll come back
[14:41] this afternoon and look at it some more
[14:43] and the good thing about two services
[14:45] that close together is maybe you won't
[14:47] forget what I said this morning by this
[14:50] afternoon so so maybe you can retain it
[14:52] and hold on to it for just a few hours
[14:55] and we don't have to go back and am and
[14:57] regroup and and do too much of the
[14:58] morning but but but the promise to
[15:01] Abraham I will make of thee a great
[15:04] nation now let's look at a couple other
[15:06] vers go flip over one page there Genesis
[15:09] 13 I want you to see a few of these
[15:11] verses together and and it seems like
[15:14] every time and you'll notice as we run
[15:16] through a couple of these that every
[15:18] time the Lord came and had anything to
[15:20] say to Abraham he kept telling him the
[15:23] same thing over and over watch this
[15:25] verse 14 Genesis 13 and verse1 14 the
[15:28] Lord said unto Abram after the lot was
[15:30] separated lift up your eyes look from
[15:32] the place where you are northward
[15:33] Southward Eastward Westward all the land
[15:36] which thou seest to thee will I give it
[15:38] to thy seed forever and I will make thy
[15:41] seed as the dust of the earth amen think
[15:44] of that he just told him here one
[15:45] chapter earlier when he first met him y
[15:48] that's that's his first meeting when he
[15:49] first met him he said Abram I'm going to
[15:51] make a great nation out of you hooks up
[15:54] with him again here in Chapter 13 and he
[15:57] says you know Abram here's what I want
[15:58] to tell you today I will make thy seed
[16:01] as the dust of the earth so that if a
[16:04] man can number the dust of the earth
[16:06] then shall thy seed also be numbered
[16:08] right amen same thing he told him over
[16:10] there in chapter 12 I'm going to have a
[16:12] great nation you're go over to Genesis
[16:14] 15 flip over one more page you're going
[16:16] to find Genesis 15 and verse
[16:21] 4 and behold the word of the Lord came
[16:24] unto him saying this shall not be thine
[16:26] air of course he's asking about about
[16:29] the other one there but he that shall
[16:30] come forth out of thine out of thine own
[16:33] bow shall be thine air and he brought
[16:35] him forth a broad and he said look now
[16:37] toward Heaven Y and tell the Stars if
[16:41] thou be able to number them and he said
[16:42] unto him so shall thy seed be am same
[16:47] message same message three chapters same
[16:49] message going over to Genesis chapter
[16:52] 17 you reckon the Lord wanted Abraham to
[16:55] understand something come come on amen
[16:59] you talk about a Johnny one note this is
[17:01] a Johnny one note message for Abraham I
[17:04] am going to make a great nation out of
[17:06] you they're going to be like the dust of
[17:08] the earth they're going to be like the
[17:09] stars of Heaven he told him in chapter
[17:11] 17 Abram now he's 90 years old and nine
[17:14] he was only 75 back over there in
[17:16] chapter 12 here he is 90 years old and
[17:19] nine the Lord appeared to him and said I
[17:21] am the almighty God walk before me be
[17:23] thou perfect and I will make my Covenant
[17:25] between me and thee and will mult M
[17:28] Supply thee
[17:30] exceedingly he fell on his face and God
[17:33] talked with him saying as for me behold
[17:36] my Covenant is with thee and you'll be a
[17:38] father of many nations right neither
[17:40] shall thy name anymore be called Abram
[17:42] but thy name Shall be Called Abraham for
[17:44] a father of many nations have I made
[17:47] thee and I will make thee exceeding
[17:49] fruitful right I will make nations of
[17:52] thee and Kings shall come out of thee
[17:56] amen ain't that amazing one message
[17:59] this is all I got to say to you Abraham
[18:02] leave your Kindred come out and I am
[18:04] going to make a great nation out of thee
[18:08] and when he got a a chance to talk to
[18:10] him again you know what God's message
[18:11] was I will make a great nation Out Of
[18:14] Thee I will multiply Thee I will
[18:16] increase thee exceedingly right now we
[18:20] know what Abraham's seed became but
[18:22] quickly go over to Exodus chap 1 and I
[18:25] want you to see one thing as we get into
[18:27] our text
[18:29] because you'll find something and I
[18:31] found this very alarming after God comes
[18:33] to Abram over and over and over and
[18:36] after his name was changed to Abraham
[18:39] he's coming by and he's telling him the
[18:41] same thing but we get over to Exodus
[18:43] chapter
[18:45] 1 and the scripture tells us these are
[18:48] the names of the children of Israel
[18:50] which came into Egypt every man in this
[18:52] houseold came with Jacob Reuben Simeon
[18:55] Levi Judah isachar zebulun Benjamin D
[18:58] Napal Gad and Asher look at verse 5 and
[19:02] all the souls that came out of the loins
[19:04] of Jacob right how
[19:07] many 70 right 70 wait a minute wait a
[19:13] minute I'm going to make a great nation
[19:15] out of thee yeah I'm going to multiply
[19:18] thee exceedingly right and 200 years
[19:22] later through four
[19:25] generations now I know you're sitting
[19:27] down you're thinking oh man what's
[19:28] what's wrong with this picture that's
[19:30] what I was thinking right 70 the the
[19:34] souls that came into Egypt out of the
[19:36] loins of Jacob were 70 Souls now that's
[19:39] Abraham Isaac and now Jacob right and
[19:42] there's 70 Souls of that house of Jacob
[19:46] right went into Egypt for Joseph was in
[19:48] Egypt already yep
[19:52] 70 now I I I just only want to stop here
[19:56] and have you think about that for a a
[19:58] minute because Abraham had already lived
[20:00] through 25 years of
[20:03] frustration okay come
[20:05] on no y'all I know what you're going to
[20:07] do you're going to jump over there where
[20:08] Paul said
[20:10] Abraham believed and it was accounted
[20:12] unto him for righteousness and Abraham
[20:15] had a great time walking around for
[20:16] those 25 years well I'm going to
[20:19] disagree with that how wonderful of a
[20:21] time he was having he tried a few times
[20:23] to help God's program along right sure
[20:26] did but do you see the point trying to
[20:28] make after 200 years through Abraham
[20:31] through Isaac through Jacob the seed of
[20:33] Jacob was 70 right y 70 Souls y right
[20:40] now of course if you read just a couple
[20:42] of more chapters you'll find out and the
[20:44] children of Israel were fruitful right
[20:47] brother random said when the time of the
[20:48] promise draws nigh God has a way of
[20:51] making it work out right amen right see
[20:54] I want to stop I'm going to hammer this
[20:56] down for just a minute because I want
[20:57] you to understand understand
[20:59] Abraham's mental dilemma every time I
[21:01] talk to you Lord I'm going to be
[21:03] multiplied I'm going to be fruitful
[21:04] there's going to be lots of me yeah I'm
[21:06] going to have kids and grandkids and
[21:08] they're there's going to be many many
[21:09] many fruit the sand of the sea the stars
[21:12] of heaven but after 200 years he calls a
[21:16] family reunion yeah with Jacob and all
[21:19] of his family and you know how many show
[21:21] up 70 right I know there's more Dales
[21:25] than that around here yeah come on come
[21:28] on that a that won't even scratch the
[21:30] Dale family
[21:31] exactly after 200 years
[21:34] Abraham's promised
[21:36] lineage had grew to
[21:41] 70 I me believe he had to hold on to the
[21:44] promise how many you believe he had to
[21:46] instill that promise in Isaac's heart
[21:47] and in Jacob's heart because we find out
[21:50] that soon after they got down there into
[21:53] Egypt the Pharaoh looked around and said
[21:54] wait a minute something is happening
[21:56] here to Abraham SE yeah they are
[21:59] multiplying like rabbits I mean there
[22:01] are just children of Israel
[22:04] everywhere and so what did Pharaoh do he
[22:06] started on a population control yeah
[22:10] yeah sure he did There Rose up a pharaoh
[22:12] we could read it but to save time there
[22:14] rose up a pharaoh who knew not Joseph
[22:16] right and so he looked around and all
[22:18] these Israelites were were were growing
[22:20] in numbers and he said wow if another
[22:22] king invades us they're going to join up
[22:23] with him and we're going to be in
[22:25] trouble so we better do something y you
[22:28] know what the first thing he was to hold
[22:29] down the seat of Abraham was he the
[22:31] first thing he did was he worked the men
[22:33] so hard come on you remember read it you
[22:36] can read it when you go home put them to
[22:38] work we're going to take away your straw
[22:41] but we need just as many bricks as you
[22:42] ever gave us before sounds like our
[22:45] economy today don't it come on come on
[22:49] how many believe the devil will put you
[22:51] under so much Financial strain even if
[22:53] you've read Dr Ramsay's book but he will
[22:56] still put you under so much Financial
[22:59] strain that the enemy will come along
[23:01] and say man you need two jobs or three
[23:03] jobs in order to make it come which if
[23:05] you do that we'll take you right out of
[23:07] church and you'll never have time for
[23:09] God
[23:10] anymore that's what Pharaoh does pharaoh
[23:14] said look we got to hold this down and
[23:16] so what he did he worked the men so hard
[23:18] that when they would get home he was
[23:19] hoping they wouldn't come in under their
[23:21] wives and bear more children yeah M is't
[23:24] that what the enemy wants us to do work
[23:26] so hard he wants us
[23:28] I was telling somebody the other day it
[23:30] used to be when I first came in this
[23:32] message back in the in 1969 in those
[23:34] early years those
[23:36] 7s people would move 200 miles to go to
[23:39] a
[23:40] church you don't find that happening no
[23:42] more now they're moving 200 miles away
[23:44] to go to a job back then they' leave
[23:47] their job and come to the church and now
[23:49] they'll leave the church and go to their
[23:51] job what's wrong with this picture
[23:54] that's right right but but these
[23:55] children of Israel were multiplying
[23:57] until a few hundred years later we went
[24:00] in 70 and how many came out yeah right 2
[24:04] million right the promise was not
[24:07] negated right the power to fulfill that
[24:09] promise lay in the promise
[24:12] itself Abraham I will help you I will do
[24:16] this I will multiply you and then when
[24:18] the time of the promise Drew nigh Israel
[24:21] began to populate right amen and Pharaoh
[24:24] looked around says wow how they do
[24:25] populate how they are growing right and
[24:28] so he he be but of course after the
[24:31] after he worked the men so hard there
[24:32] was still children coming so he said
[24:35] well we got to do something else let's
[24:36] just uh get the midwives on our team and
[24:38] we'll hire The Midwives and when the
[24:40] children are born we'll just have them
[24:41] take care of at that point in time we'll
[24:44] you know how miserably that failed The
[24:45] Midwives says we don't want no part of
[24:47] that Pharaoh called him back in says
[24:49] what's wrong you're not doing what I
[24:50] told you so well man these Hebrew women
[24:52] when they when they have those babies
[24:54] they're Lively and they're just there we
[24:56] know it right the babies come and and
[25:00] man sounds like some of our message
[25:01] churches don't it that's right amen some
[25:03] of our message churches are building
[25:05] themselves one baby at a time you know
[25:07] just the nurseries aren't big enough
[25:09] anymore right amen but but the point is
[25:11] he said the midwives fail so then he
[25:14] said hey that's not working let's let's
[25:16] just throw them in the river yeah you
[25:18] remember how that that went you know
[25:20] there was an amram and right and a joker
[25:23] bed down there say wait a minute this
[25:25] child is born a goodly child and that's
[25:27] why brother and when the time of the
[25:28] promise of bringing those children out
[25:30] after being down there for 400 years
[25:33] when the time of that promise Drew nigh
[25:35] God raised up a deliverer and you know
[25:38] the story of Moses and we're on Abraham
[25:39] we're not going to get to Moses but the
[25:41] point that we're trying to make is this
[25:43] the promise began to be fulfilled right
[25:46] and and and this is the text we want to
[25:48] look at this morning go back with me if
[25:50] you will and I want you to follow and I
[25:53] and I'm going to be real conscious of
[25:54] the time so we have time for our lunch
[25:56] and our all the things that we're doing
[26:00] today but we'll go back to Genesis if
[26:03] you will and again in chapter 12 you got
[26:07] to First establish anytime you talk
[26:09] about Abraham you got to First establish
[26:11] some of the most fundamental principles
[26:14] of his life that brother brandham gave
[26:16] us there's a quote in Israel in the
[26:18] church that I want you to notice Genesis
[26:20] 12 and verse1 the Lord said Abram get
[26:23] thee out and I want you to notice in
[26:25] this message it's in Israel in the
[26:26] church 19
[26:28] 53 he says brother R says Abraham was
[26:31] coming from Babylon with his father down
[26:33] into Shar the valley of Shar where the
[26:36] souls of many journeyed after the
[26:38] destroying of Babylon or the confusion
[26:41] Abraham's father parent brought Abraham
[26:43] and his loved ones down into Shar and
[26:46] all that land listen at this quote now
[26:49] all that land among all those people God
[26:52] found favor with one brother Rand stops
[26:55] he says one man found favor with God
[26:58] now here's an odd statement for brother
[27:00] Rand to make now I want you to notice
[27:03] that is the beginning of Christianity of
[27:06] the church right mhm think of that that
[27:09] is the beginning of the Christianity of
[27:12] the church right amen everybody out in
[27:14] the land might not understand what
[27:16] brother brandom is saying because
[27:17] they'll say well Calvary was the
[27:18] beginning of Christianity of the church
[27:21] right but brother brandham took it back
[27:23] to Abraham he said I want you to notice
[27:25] that is the beginning of Christianity
[27:28] right amen I know you got you're going
[27:31] to think of some other things brother
[27:32] Ram said he said back in the garden that
[27:34] Cain was worshiping and Abel was
[27:36] worshiping so maybe maybe he didn't
[27:38] really mean what he said but you have to
[27:40] understand him looking at Abraham mhm
[27:43] what brother brandom is telling us that
[27:45] here's he goes on follow with me just a
[27:48] minute I want you to notice it wasn't
[27:50] because Abraham was a good man it was
[27:54] because God elected and chose Abraham
[27:56] right it wasn't Abraham choosing God it
[28:00] was God choosing Abraham can you see it
[28:03] that's right and now watch now as it was
[28:06] then so is it today it isn't you
[28:07] choosing God it's God choosing you
[28:11] that's right how many don't like to hear
[28:13] messages on Election you know why you
[28:16] enjoy them because you believe you're a
[28:18] part of it I love messages on election
[28:21] man I didn't choose God God chose
[28:24] me on on down in the message after that
[28:28] one called Jehovah Gyra
[28:29] 1957 now God called Abraham not because
[28:33] he was Abraham God called Abraham by
[28:36] election right Abraham was no good man
[28:41] right no better than anybody else that's
[28:45] right he probably come out of the group
[28:47] of idolators down there from the Tower
[28:49] of Babel where they worship the roots of
[28:51] the
[28:52] ground he was a root worshipper yeah and
[28:56] God chose him yeah and they had a woman
[28:58] up there she had all kinds of curious
[29:00] arts and practices if you've ever read
[29:02] the history that's where the first
[29:04] organized church ever begin was in
[29:06] Babylon by Nimrod organized all the
[29:08] cities and they paid tribute now
[29:10] Abraham's father brought him down from
[29:12] Babylon they dwelt in the city of ER in
[29:14] the land of Cala and Abraham and over
[29:18] and over brother brandham uses these
[29:19] words Abraham was just an ordinary man
[29:23] like you and I amen just an ordinary man
[29:26] oh I I want you to get it God by forn
[29:29] knowledge called and elected Abraham he
[29:32] knew his heart he knew him before the
[29:36] foundation of the world and Abraham only
[29:38] fit into God's program oh my brothers
[29:41] and sisters if there's anything I want
[29:42] this morning and that is to fit into
[29:44] God's program by election and by calling
[29:48] I want to fit into God's program
[29:51] wherever that is that's right and
[29:52] Abraham's wife was named Sarah on down
[29:55] in a message called Jesus on the
[29:56] authority of the word word brother says
[29:58] seeing Abraham back there no more than
[30:01] any other man out of the land of Cala
[30:04] coming down from out of The Valleys of
[30:06] Shar perhaps an
[30:09] idolator perhap but
[30:12] God God by Sovereign election shows him
[30:16] that's right Abraham I have saved you
[30:19] and your seed after you oh God told him
[30:22] to look at the dust of the earth and
[30:23] number it then the Sands of the sea and
[30:26] then the Stars of Heaven innumerable I
[30:29] like this little quote his seed would be
[30:31] coming from the dust to the Stars oh
[30:34] don't you see brothers and sisters over
[30:36] and over brother Brandon wanted us
[30:37] here's some I'll run through real
[30:40] quickly but God called Abraham not
[30:43] because he was good but because God
[30:46] chose Abraham notice Abraham was just an
[30:49] ordinary man come down from Babylon he
[30:51] dwelt in the land of Shar perhaps his
[30:54] diet was he'd go out in the morning and
[30:56] he'd picked some berries from the the
[30:57] bushes go out and kill an animal and
[30:59] have his Noonday meal and some more
[31:01] berries for supper and so forth and
[31:03] while Abraham being just an ordinary man
[31:06] God chose Abraham by election that's
[31:09] right how many are glad you can sit back
[31:11] and say man I just want to be ordinary
[31:13] right you know being ordinary in 2012
[31:16] ain't quite good enough for most folks
[31:19] no they got to be something being
[31:21] ordinary ain't very popular
[31:24] anymore because who wants to be ordinary
[31:26] I do right because brother said Abraham
[31:29] was ordinary just like me and you picked
[31:32] berries in the morning killed an animal
[31:34] for lunch pick berries in the even one
[31:36] place brother R said he did pretty well
[31:38] financially in the land yeah he one
[31:42] place brother R said I got here he said
[31:43] he wasn't much of a Holiness man why he
[31:46] was an idolator he was a farmer down
[31:49] there farming berries and and worshiping
[31:52] the roots of trees and God called him
[31:57] and said Abraham come out I am going to
[31:59] do this to you unconditional how many
[32:03] times did Brother R use the word
[32:05] unconditional when when when working
[32:07] with Abraham all over and over one day
[32:10] Abraham was out walking around at 75
[32:12] years old there he goes again married to
[32:15] Sarah she was just a girl 65 years
[32:18] old don't you see he made in Abraham's
[32:22] Grace Covenant brother said he made it
[32:24] to Abraham not Abraham if you will do a
[32:26] certain thing I'll make a great nation
[32:27] out of you and make you a father of
[32:29] Nations he said I have done it Glory
[32:33] when it let me tell you and then let me
[32:35] read this other quote and you'll
[32:37] understand why brother brandham called
[32:38] Abraham the beginning of Christianity in
[32:41] Israel in the church in 1953 brother Ram
[32:44] says he elected Abra Abraham now listen
[32:48] and that was the very
[32:50] beginning of our Salvation right right
[32:53] amen God's call to Abraham was the very
[32:56] beginning beginning of our Salvation
[32:59] that was given to a man when he called
[33:01] him and elected him and predestinated
[33:03] him and gave him a promise and made a
[33:05] covenant with Abraham and his seed
[33:07] forever he said we could go ahead and
[33:09] read a full chapter but we haven't got
[33:11] the time God called watch when he called
[33:14] Abraham here he called him by election
[33:17] amen not because he was because God
[33:22] was that's right don't you remember this
[33:24] is the point of Abraham and brother
[33:27] brandom in two places over here he said
[33:29] it was the beginning of Christianity and
[33:31] Not only was it the beginning of all
[33:33] Christianity it was the beginning of our
[33:36] Salvation now why would brother renam
[33:39] tell us that amen it's because he's
[33:41] looking at a man yeah a man that Paul
[33:44] wrote over there that and said in in
[33:47] Galatians that Abraham
[33:50] believed and it was accounted unto him
[33:52] for righteousness amen that's right
[33:54] brother brandham looked at the beginning
[33:56] of Christian ity is simply being a man
[33:59] that could be walking around living an
[34:01] everyday normal life very
[34:03] ordinary and he could have the word of
[34:05] the Lord come and speak to him right and
[34:08] he would just simply say if I can
[34:11] paraphrase sister hadie right that ain't
[34:13] nothing but the truth right amen right
[34:16] that was the beginning of Christianity
[34:18] was when the word came and a man who had
[34:21] no background no training no religious
[34:25] experience nothing good about him he was
[34:28] an idolator he wasn't a Holiness man he
[34:30] was an ordinary man and Christianity
[34:33] began when a man could hear the word of
[34:35] the Lord and could believe it and follow
[34:38] it amen and say that ain't nothing but
[34:40] the truth right amen all I'm trying to
[34:43] say to you brothers and sisters is
[34:45] Christianity began that way and
[34:47] Christianity is going to end that way
[34:50] because there is going to be a bride
[34:52] here in the end time that can simply
[34:54] look at the word of the Lord that can
[34:57] stare at it and the word of the Lord can
[34:58] come and it can be quickened to her and
[35:02] all she can say is what Abraham said I
[35:04] believe it that ain't nothing but the
[35:07] truth and Christianity will go out the
[35:10] same way right Christianity came in that
[35:13] way and there's going to be a little
[35:14] bride standing here in the end time that
[35:17] says we shall not prevent or hinder
[35:19] those which are asleep but we shall all
[35:22] be changed in the moment in the
[35:24] twinkling of an ey how are you going to
[35:26] go help that program along right amen
[35:29] come on I can't even change myself
[35:31] that's right I'm sure I can lose a
[35:33] little weight I can try to get some
[35:35] six-pack abs under all these layers of
[35:37] other fleshly matter that is there
[35:40] covering them over I can do that but
[35:43] that ain't going to change me that's not
[35:45] going to give me a glorified body to
[35:47] meet him in N right I am sitting here
[35:50] like Abraham was a word of the Lord that
[35:52] says you are my elected I have chosen
[35:56] you
[35:57] to fulfill exactly my
[36:00] plan oh I go into churches sometimes and
[36:04] and you know everybody you know the old
[36:05] Pentecostal way you remember the old
[36:07] Pentecostal way of testifying and I I
[36:10] hope I ain't picking on nobody here I
[36:12] don't mean to do that oh oh get a good
[36:14] old Pentecostal sister up and she get
[36:16] all emotional oh I just want to go home
[36:18] so bad you remember those test I just
[36:21] want to see Jesus just that's good I
[36:23] mean we all want to see Jesus right yeah
[36:25] just want to see Jesus is so bad and
[36:28] sure enough the next week she'll come
[36:29] down with some kind of an ailment yeah
[36:32] and and I'm sitting around thinking I
[36:34] just heard her say she was wanting to go
[36:35] home right yeah but the time I get back
[36:38] to church you know what's laying on the
[36:39] pull pit of prayer request oh
[36:41] my those two things aren't adding up
[36:44] right I thought she want to go
[36:49] home all of a sudden she's down at the
[36:51] doctor looking for some stay longer
[36:53] pills come
[36:55] on are you following me that's right see
[36:58] sometimes we don't know what we want I
[37:01] feel like Paul whether present or absent
[37:03] I want to be accepted if I go by the way
[37:06] of the Grave I want to be accepted but I
[37:09] am here believing that as the bride in
[37:11] the end time there is an elect lady that
[37:14] will take a change of the body and I
[37:16] want to go home but to be honest with
[37:18] you I want to go that way right amen I
[37:21] mean I'm going to keep this old fell
[37:22] around as long as I can it gets a little
[37:25] bit morbid when you get the the other
[37:27] way right I used I used to sit back and
[37:29] say man she want to go home she want to
[37:31] go home you know and then she gets sick
[37:33] and she don't want to go home so I was
[37:35] confused we all want to go home we want
[37:37] it to be over but we want to be here
[37:41] because the word has promised there is
[37:44] an elect lady that will fill that word
[37:47] sir and I believe brothers and sisters
[37:49] we are living in that age everything we
[37:52] have from this message convinces us and
[37:55] if it's all right you I'm just going to
[37:57] hang around till then amen and if I
[37:59] don't hang around then just wish me a
[38:01] goodbye and I'll see you very soon
[38:03] there's no shame in those hav gone on
[38:05] before there's no disgrace because
[38:07] they're getting up first amen come on y
[38:11] I'm not going to stop them no you know
[38:13] everybody reads it we not prevent or
[38:15] hinder you know what prevent or
[38:16] hindering that means we're going to God
[38:18] won't even let us get in the way of that
[38:20] happening we shall not prevent or hinder
[38:23] those which are asleep but they shall be
[38:26] quick and they shall be raised amen
[38:29] that's right don't you see that is the
[38:31] very beginning of Christianity the
[38:33] beginning of Salvation when there is
[38:35] just simply an ordinary man that can
[38:39] look at the word of God that comes to
[38:40] him and he can rise and go to meet it
[38:43] amen that's what Abraham did when he
[38:45] hears the word a for ordained son hears
[38:47] the word he'll rise and go to meet it
[38:50] and that's what Abraham did and that's
[38:52] all we can do here in the end time is
[38:54] rise and go to me whatever part of the
[38:56] word thank you Lord It's fulfilled in it
[38:58] you're going to ask me then do you
[38:59] believe you're going to be here till the
[39:00] change yes my dear brother yes that's
[39:02] right I believe the Lord has let me come
[39:04] in an age in a time when that word is
[39:08] going to be fulfilled amen and I want
[39:10] him to continue quickening in my heart
[39:13] this word to pull me to that chain to
[39:16] pull me to that Resurrection amen I'm
[39:18] counting on right that's right I'm only
[39:21] 53 you're talking to a man that thought
[39:23] it would be over in
[39:24] 1977 right yeah I mean y'all been around
[39:27] that long we did everything leading up
[39:29] to 1977 we had the little purple books
[39:32] we we prepared we we did everything we
[39:35] could do to get ready because we just we
[39:38] just didn't we did the best we could we
[39:40] didn't understand I where we live there
[39:43] in Tennessee the dear brother he was
[39:44] doing the best he could at one point in
[39:46] time he had a stored up canned goods I
[39:48] never could quite figure out what that
[39:49] was about yeah canned goods aren't
[39:51] needed for the change I want you to know
[39:53] that don't rush home and stock up your
[39:56] pant
[39:57] you ain't going to get through the
[39:58] squeeze unscathed I hate to tell you
[40:00] that this morning that's right I don't
[40:02] mean I don't I don't mean to man man get
[40:04] all depressing now I gets to talk about
[40:06] the squeeze you're not going to get
[40:08] through unscathed right I don't know how
[40:11] to read those quotes about when that
[40:13] little hunted persecuted group how do
[40:16] you put little hunted and persecuted
[40:18] into one sentence and think we're going
[40:20] to get by yeah yeah right when brother
[40:23] brand said you that follow the pillar of
[40:24] fire you're going to have a rough time
[40:26] of it
[40:27] right and I know and I forgive me but I
[40:30] know some well that's going to be a
[40:32] mental squeeze well yes we're going to
[40:33] be mentally squeeze yeah but I don't
[40:36] think little hunted and persecuted in a
[40:38] rough time go along with a mental
[40:41] squeeze when I'm traveling I'm still
[40:43] staying in the holiday ends I mean
[40:45] that's not the squeeze yet I want you to
[40:47] know that that's right come
[40:49] on oh would you don't understand I can't
[40:52] pay my power bill that's the squeeze
[40:54] your power bill is not the squeeze
[40:58] the fact you can't make your mortgage is
[41:00] not the squeeze the squeeze is the wrath
[41:03] of Satan where the Book of Revelations
[41:05] tells us that he will be very wroth
[41:07] right and he will come after a little
[41:09] hunted and persecuted group and the only
[41:12] reason you will be squeezed is because
[41:14] you are identified with that Pillar of
[41:17] Fire there are many Believers message
[41:20] Believers that the squeeze will be going
[41:22] on and they won't even know the squeeze
[41:24] is on right because they're not
[41:27] identified with the pillar of fire amen
[41:29] and I don't even want to preach on I got
[41:31] notes on it but I don't want to do that
[41:32] right because as soon as you do
[41:34] everybody go oh man we got to get some
[41:35] more shotguns more more ammunition yeah
[41:38] there ain't enough ammo ain't enough
[41:42] food ain't enough of your
[41:45] abilities do I look forward to it I'm no
[41:49] you know I don't like pain right I don't
[41:52] like pain my wife left my charger cord
[41:54] to my electric shaver in the hotel in
[41:56] Ohio the other day can y'all believe she
[41:57] would do that and so I had to get me one
[42:00] of those mock threes out of the out of
[42:02] the drugstore the other day and a can of
[42:03] shaving cream and I cut my lip this
[42:06] morning right here I'm still

[42:11] that's my wife's fault back there that's
[42:14] right am cuz I said have you got
[42:17] everything think I got
[42:25] everything
[42:26] yeah it's right here can you see it it's
[42:28] swelled up it
[42:31] hurts it's not her fault I plugged it in
[42:33] over there where we left it there you go
[42:35] and I remember the court dropping down
[42:37] kind of behind the little cabinet they
[42:39] had there so true brother true so it
[42:41] ain't my
[42:43] fault even though I plugged it
[42:47] in we have a wonderful system my wife
[42:50] and I when we travel I do nothing and
[42:52] she does
[42:55] everything it's a great system see yeah
[42:58] she
[42:59] does I got a great
[43:02] system I lay there on the bed tell me
[43:05] when we're
[43:07] packed if I feel well I will help you
[43:09] get it out to the
[43:11] car no I help get it in the car but she
[43:13] does all the
[43:15] packing gives me something to talk to
[43:18] her about I can come charging out of the
[43:20] I had to come out yesterday I can't find
[43:22] nothing I mean you think you'd be able
[43:24] to find the stuff you need
[43:27] you pack you that's true brother way is
[43:29] right if I packed it I'd know where it
[43:30] was
[43:32] but the Lord has been good gave me a
[43:34] wife that could put up with me that's
[43:36] right yes
[43:42] sir and I could go on and say that for
[43:44] sister June back
[43:47] there oh
[43:50] man
[43:51] yeah I tell you what it's gotten to
[43:54] where they're inviting sister tun Back
[43:56] to Witch
[43:57] talk I I I guess they assume brother
[44:00] Wade will come along
[44:02] but yes the Lord is Blessing
[44:06] you amen all right my goodness my
[44:08] goodness but do you see our where where
[44:11] was I at we're down to that point of the
[44:14] beginning of our Salvation was simply a
[44:16] man that could take the word of God and
[44:19] say right as sister hadri did that ain't
[44:22] nothing but the truth what's expected of
[44:23] us here in the end is to take that
[44:26] reveal word and simply believe and it
[44:28] was accounted unto him right for
[44:31] righteousness amen now see we always we
[44:34] we we all man up here in the end time we
[44:36] read all these things about Abraham and
[44:38] when our minds go to
[44:39] Abraham all we can remember is the good
[44:42] stuff yeah right how many agree with me
[44:44] come onen sure how many when you think
[44:47] of of your father Abraham remember
[44:50] because because Paul over there says
[44:52] that that Abraham staggered not at the
[44:55] promise of God but was strong in faith
[44:58] holding on to that promise and I read
[45:01] that scripture and Paul is just like us
[45:03] we're looking back at Abraham and all we
[45:05] can remember about him is the good stuff
[45:08] right yeah but when a Paul said Abraham
[45:12] staggered not at the promise of God I'm
[45:14] I'm again sitting back reading the
[45:16] scripture and saying wait a
[45:18] minute wait a minute hold on Paul I'm
[45:21] reading Genesis and I'm reading about
[45:24] Abraham living through 10 or 12 12 of
[45:26] those 25 years without the promised son
[45:29] right and I'm
[45:32] remembering Hagar coming along Sarah
[45:35] saying wait a minute Abraham it's not
[45:37] working out I done what did Brother say
[45:39] she had done knitted so many booties
[45:40] they were piling up all around her
[45:42] waiting on the promised son and she came
[45:45] along and said Abraham what about taking
[45:46] Hagar my handmaid and fulfill the
[45:48] promise through her yeah so Abraham went
[45:51] to the Lord and said well if you're
[45:52] going to ask you just go ahead and do it
[45:53] that that yep yeah and I'm remembering
[45:56] that but Paul's getting over there and
[45:58] this is a good quote that brother
[45:59] brother Brandon made let me read it out
[46:01] of the message of Grace in 1961 he said
[46:04] when I think of Abraham of all the
[46:07] mistakes that he made right see brother
[46:10] brandom thought about them mistakes too
[46:12] all right when I think of Abraham of all
[46:14] the mistakes that he made and Moses and
[46:17] his mistakes but when Abraham's
[46:20] commentary was written now listen when
[46:22] the Divine commentary was written right
[46:25] when Paul wrote Abraham's commentary he
[46:29] never mentioned one thing about
[46:31] Abraham's unbelief no no never was even
[46:35] accounted to him
[46:37] amen right when I think about it brother
[46:40] brand says don't don't don't un
[46:42] christianize me for me thinking about it
[46:44] because brother said when I think about
[46:46] it and all the mistakes he made come on
[46:50] oh brother say my humble prayer is
[46:52] before the grace of God that's here this
[46:54] morning I hope mind wrote like that that
[46:57] he won't see my mistakes that's right
[46:59] that when my commentary is written my
[47:01] obituary that it won't be read out that
[47:04] I made mistakes and done wrong but he'll
[47:07] only see the things that I tried to do
[47:09] for him sir oh my he'll take the grace
[47:12] of God that I believe in and that's
[47:13] where I'm solely trusting upon my merits
[47:16] I could no more go in none of the rest
[47:18] but upon the grace of God I'm depending
[47:20] yes it's Grace that I'm depending on
[47:23] brother sister when I think of Abraham
[47:26] he mentioned all the mistakes he
[47:28] mentioned ishmail coming on the scene
[47:30] trying to fulfill the promise of God
[47:32] brother R in one place he says how could
[47:34] Abraham go down there and let ailec take
[47:37] his wife like that he says that ain't
[47:39] even a Christian thing to do to let
[47:41] another man take your wife to save your
[47:43] own skin right he said that's not even
[47:46] right that's a mistake Abraham made but
[47:48] yet when Paul wrote that commentary the
[47:51] Divine commentary aren't you glad
[47:54] there's a commentary and Divine
[47:56] commentary yes sir what we all see here
[47:59] living every day rubbing shoulders
[48:00] together bumping into each other that's
[48:02] commentary right but on the other side
[48:05] my dear brothers and sisters there's a
[48:07] Divine commentary and in that Divine
[48:09] commentary is wrote over the top I am my
[48:12] beloveds and he is mine and His Banner
[48:14] Over Me Is Life there is a people that
[48:17] can believe that in spite of all of our
[48:19] mistakes in spite of all of our
[48:21] stumblings in spite of all of our
[48:23] blunderings that we are still yes amen
[48:26] that's right oh don't you see God knew
[48:28] the heart of Abraham oh I'm only
[48:31] interested in the Divine commentary
[48:33] right that's why when I go over there
[48:35] and I read Paul that great author
[48:38] brother brand said Paul had one thing in
[48:40] mind as he taught on adoption and that
[48:42] was to knock out every fear of ever
[48:45] falling away right right right knock it
[48:47] out y not stand up and remind people if
[48:50] you don't do this you might not make it
[48:52] and if you don't do that you might not
[48:53] make it and if you do that there's no
[48:55] hope for you yeah brother brandom said
[48:58] Paul had to knock that out of the
[48:59] people's mind that they could be saved
[49:02] one day and then fall again the next day
[49:04] and then save back again another day you
[49:07] know what brother R call that kind of
[49:08] preaching nonsense right he said that's
[49:12] nonsense he said once you have the Holy
[49:15] Ghost you are sealed until the day of
[49:17] your Redemption Lord but preachers will
[49:20] still get up and they'll they'll they'll
[49:22] they'll read you your commentary right
[49:24] this natural you did this and you did
[49:27] that and you did this and you you and
[49:29] and all I can see is you doing all of
[49:31] these things I've had to remind some
[49:33] brothers along the way but there is a
[49:35] Divine commentary ready I will
[49:37] acknowledge yes I stumbled yes I fell
[49:40] yes I have to repent every day just like
[49:42] brother brandham did right but in my
[49:44] Divine commentary it's not even written
[49:47] I am like Abraham right he wrote A
[49:50] Commentary about me on the other side
[49:51] that said he never did it go back to
[49:54] Invisible Union of the bride ask me how
[49:56] many times brother brandom can say she
[49:58] never did it she never did it she never
[50:02] did it talking about that bride but the
[50:05] devil will come along and say I know you
[50:07] did it and and he knows you did it and
[50:09] she knows you did it and you know you
[50:11] did it we all know you did it he's just
[50:13] reading the wrong commentary there is a
[50:16] Divine commentary that says though I may
[50:18] fall 10,000 times he'll pick me up again
[50:22] because I'm his all that kind of
[50:24] teaching on a is hard on people brother
[50:27] said when you get to teaching on
[50:29] predestination and adoption and God's
[50:31] sealing you in that's hard on people y
[50:34] sure it's hard on people it's not for
[50:37] everybody that's right not everybody can
[50:39] grasp on to that there's there's a
[50:40] little quote I want you to notice this
[50:42] is an Abraham and his seed after him is
[50:45] this water yes sir this water are you
[50:46] sure
[50:49] not thank you find this quote for me
[50:52] Abraham in a seat brother starts out I'm
[50:54] going to put two books up here we put
[50:57] two books up here and he was laying two
[50:59] books like this and call these books to
[51:02] Abraham and his seed after him yeah now
[51:05] what he did for Abraham he done for his
[51:08] seed after him glory amen all that
[51:11] understand that Clearly say amen amen
[51:13] amen
[51:14] now now if you notice in Genesis 12 God
[51:17] called Abraham by election not because
[51:20] Abraham had done anything to deserve it
[51:23] he might have been an idolor I don't
[51:25] know at Babylon they worship roots and
[51:27] Abraham had come down from there with
[51:29] his father now God called him by
[51:31] election now I want to stop here on this
[51:33] teaching on election and I want you to
[51:35] notice this next quote now God called
[51:38] him by election he says now
[51:41] Brethren my precious darling Brethren if
[51:44] I happen to get out of order in the
[51:46] scriptural Doctrine will you just
[51:48] forgive me for it and know it's my
[51:51] ignorance will you do it that's a nice
[51:54] nice sentiment you my precious darling
[51:56] Brethren if I get out on a election here
[51:58] and and I'm teaching will you just
[52:00] forgive me for it dot dot dot question
[52:03] mark you see it there and he says and my
[52:07] theological Brethren out there if you
[52:09] feel my Doctrine is
[52:11] wrong will you just forget it yeah
[52:15] right I want to stop there a Mane these
[52:18] kind of things always strike me a little
[52:20] alive I'm going to I'm going to shove
[52:23] this down I'm going to teach on Doctrine
[52:25] election hearing about Abraham and he
[52:27] says now my precious he's got how many
[52:30] will believe with me from that quote
[52:31] that brother brandham has two sets of
[52:33] Brethren sitting out there in front of
[52:35] me one group is called my precious
[52:38] darling Brethren and the other group is
[52:40] called my theological Brethren he says
[52:44] now my precious darling Brethren out
[52:46] there and that's the group that wants to
[52:48] follow the word that wants to receive
[52:50] from the ministry that wants to hear
[52:51] what God is doing he says if I get out
[52:54] of order will you just forgive me for
[52:56] it that's one group yeah and he says now
[52:59] my theological Brethren out there if you
[53:01] hear me teaching something that you
[53:02] don't agree with you know what I want
[53:04] you to do I want you to go out and
[53:05] forget about
[53:07] it yeah that's what he said will you
[53:11] just go on and leave the meeting and
[53:13] forget about it because why it ain't for
[53:16] them right there's the precious there's
[53:19] going to be theological Brethren as long
[53:21] as we are here I want you to know yet
[53:23] and they are going to hear things and
[53:25] years down the way they're going to
[53:26] wonder about the cloud and they're going
[53:28] to have problems with this and that and
[53:30] the other and there's going to be
[53:31] theological Minds that are going to look
[53:33] at this message Y and they're going to
[53:35] argue with you until doomsday yeah
[53:38] they're going to argue with you until
[53:39] the change of our bodies and they're
[53:41] going to go on forums on the internet
[53:43] and they're going to debate back and
[53:45] forth about this word and they're going
[53:47] to get all mentally stimulated by it Y
[53:50] and they would have been better as
[53:52] brother random said if you are a
[53:54] theological brother and you can't get it
[53:56] then just forget about it right there
[53:59] are a lot of message churches it would
[54:01] have been better if they had have stayed
[54:02] in the organization and never come out
[54:05] because they've turned into Cults we got
[54:06] Cults inside of this message they' have
[54:09] been better if they had never heard the
[54:10] word of God it have been better if a a
[54:13] millstone was hanged about their neck
[54:15] and cast into the sea than they would to
[54:17] be to take this precious word that that
[54:20] was delivered by Elijah right and just
[54:22] debate it and and question it and make a
[54:25] oh I like that and you theological
[54:27] Brethren if you feel my Doctrine is
[54:30] wrong here's what I want you to do just
[54:33] forget about it yeah right just call out
[54:36] act like you weren't even here now

[54:43] that I say ask your pastor I'll do
[54:45] anything I can to answer you on great
[54:46] fundamental Evangelical doctrines of the
[54:48] Bible but when it comes to should we do
[54:51] this and do that always refer to your
[54:52] pastor each man there isn't two here but
[54:54] what would disagree with one another on
[54:57] little technical things whether we
[54:59] should comb our hair on the right side
[55:01] or the left yeah I ain't had much
[55:03] disagreement about that I like what

[55:49] answers in those old cood volumes they
[55:51] called them conduct order and Doctrine
[55:53] brother random never labeled them that
[55:54] right but what they did is they took all
[55:56] the questions and answers and and they
[55:58] began sending in questions about little
[56:00] technical things yeah sure I love
[56:03] reading questions and ask but you get in

[57:20] of Christianity was a man who could
[57:21] stand there and simply believe the word
[57:24] of God
[57:25] y time after time I'm going to do this
[57:28] for you I'm going to do it I'm going to
[57:29] do it it was God's program right yeah
[57:32] and the Fulfillment of the word here in
[57:34] the end time is also God's program there
[57:37] is no way we can help this program along
[57:40] right then you know you're going to be
[57:41] like what brother said then why you
[57:43] preaching if it's all wrapped up in one
[57:44] big core of election and then why you
[57:47] preaching he said preaching is God's
[57:49] program that's why we still do it is so
[57:52] that that word will hopefully quicken in
[57:54] your heart
[57:56] but I want you to notice something with
[57:57] me here's God calling
[58:00] Abraham let me ask you before we read
[58:02] this how many love the those long
[58:04] genealogies in the Bible how many of you
[58:06] ever read the
[58:07] genealogy let me get an honest response
[58:09] I like crowd
[58:10] participation how many of you are ever
[58:12] reading over in Deuteronomy and
[58:14] Leviticus and even over in the New
[58:16] Testament about the lineage of our Lord
[58:17] and so and so be so and so and so and so
[58:20] be so and so so right yeah how many of
[58:22] you ever skipped that yeah come on
[58:25] everybody how many of you never skip how
[58:27] many read every word of the
[58:29] Bible I know you probably read through
[58:32] them at sometime or not but if I'll be
[58:34] honest with you I get into genealogy
[58:37] sometimes and I'm like wow that's a lot
[58:39] of information I don't know any of those
[58:43] people but this one is important and I
[58:45] want to show you why this one genealogy
[58:47] I hate to read genealogies in front of
[58:49] the church but I got to do this one
[58:50] Genesis 11 how many know who
[58:53] Abraham's great great great great 10
[58:56] generation back grandfather was there
[58:58] was only three come out of the AR right
[59:01] ham sham and J how many of you can you I
[59:04] I I asked for guesses one day people
[59:05] were getting the wrong one they they
[59:07] said ham and Jet but it was sham right
[59:10] Shem was Abraham now how many know and I
[59:13] ain't got time for all this but how many
[59:15] know from Adam to Noah was 10
[59:17] Generations absolutely you know from
[59:20] Noah to Abraham was how many right 10
[59:22] Generations right see the the the Earth
[59:24] had become defiled back in Noah's day
[59:26] and God said wow the Earth is so wicked
[59:29] and corrupt after 10 Generations I'm
[59:31] just going to wipe it all off well Noah
[59:34] came out on the other side and you know
[59:35] what had happened by 10 Generations
[59:37] Nimrod and Babylon and all the rest of
[59:40] it and God had promised he wouldn't
[59:43] destroy man again so he says I'm going
[59:45] to build my church another way yeah
[59:48] rather than wipe it off and have one man
[59:50] start over again I'm just going to
[59:51] choose a man out there by the name of
[59:54] Abraham
[59:55] and he's going to fill the world with
[59:57] righteousness because it was accounted
[59:59] unto him for righteousness you see the
[1:00:02] after 10 generation but here was sham
[1:00:04] and I want you to follow with me from
[1:00:06] from verse 10 of Genesis 11 now these
[1:00:10] are the generations of shim shim was 100
[1:00:13] years old got to get my glasses on

[1:01:46] getting the picture from sh on down y
[1:01:50] every generation he had this eldest and
[1:01:53] then he had more y the eldest and more
[1:01:55] the eldest and more and begat sons and
[1:01:58] daughters and begat sons and beg what
[1:02:00] was the lineage of shim it was a very
[1:02:02] prolific right it was a
[1:02:05] very fertilized nation that was coming
[1:02:08] along how do I say that every generation
[1:02:12] it was it was prolific with children y
[1:02:16] Sons and Daughters after every one of
[1:02:18] Abraham's
[1:02:20] grandparents and we get down to terara
[1:02:23] right he Liv 70 be got Abraham neor
[1:02:25] haran these are the generations of Tera
[1:02:27] verse 27 Abraham neor abror tan haran
[1:02:31] begat lot haran died again more of that
[1:02:33] genealogy stuff that just helps us along
[1:02:36] verse
[1:02:37] 29 and Abram and nahor took them wives
[1:02:40] the name of Abram's wife was Sarah the
[1:02:41] name of ne's wife milka the daughter of
[1:02:43] heran the father of milka and the father
[1:02:46] of Isaac verse
[1:02:48] 30
[1:02:49] but all of a sudden after 10 generations
[1:02:52] of children yeah there's one man Abraham
[1:02:56] comes along out of the loins of Sarah
[1:02:58] out of the loins of of of tra and he
[1:03:01] married a wife named Sarah but Sarah was
[1:03:05] Barren
[1:03:07] right she had no
[1:03:10] child but Sarah
[1:03:13] was
[1:03:16] Barren and God says and God
[1:03:20] says there's a man down there named
[1:03:22] Abraham Abram he's he's going to marry a
[1:03:25] wife and her name's Sarah and out of his
[1:03:28] loins out of his loins I am going to
[1:03:31] make a great nation right I'm going to
[1:03:35] have so much population out of the loins
[1:03:37] of Abraham it's going to be as the dust
[1:03:39] of the earth and as the sand of the sea
[1:03:41] and as the stars of Heaven y right and
[1:03:44] you know what just so everybody will
[1:03:47] understand this is my program you know
[1:03:48] what else I'm going to do I'm going to
[1:03:51] give him a Barren life yeah yeah yeah
[1:03:56] you want it to be all God's program you
[1:03:58] will understand that right there right
[1:03:59] amen Sons and Daughters Sons and
[1:04:02] Daughters 10 Generations if I was
[1:04:03] sitting back on the sidelines and I was
[1:04:05] saying Lord you need to choose a man if
[1:04:07] you're going to have a great and mighty
[1:04:09] nation and you're going to have
[1:04:10] population springing out from his
[1:04:14] loins surely surely you wouldn't hook
[1:04:17] him up with a baron wife right come on
[1:04:21] I'm looking at the program of God and
[1:04:23] I'm thinking he did a pretty good job
[1:04:24] picking Abraham right because Abraham's
[1:04:27] 10 Generations back were breeders yeah
[1:04:31] right how do I tell you that any other
[1:04:33] way right they were breeders children
[1:04:37] more children Sons and Daughters all of
[1:04:39] them until we get down to Abraham yeah
[1:04:43] and Abraham says I want the people and
[1:04:45] his seed after him to understand one
[1:04:47] thing this is my program and I will make
[1:04:52] of thee a great nation and you know how
[1:04:53] I'm going to prove it to you Abraham
[1:04:55] Sarah will have a son and one of these
[1:04:58] days you're going to take him up on the
[1:04:59] mountain even though you've had another
[1:05:01] child by Hagar over there and I'm going
[1:05:03] to remind you to take your son your only
[1:05:06] son up there on the mountain exactly the
[1:05:09] only one that's counted right the one
[1:05:11] that's got a Divine commentary written
[1:05:14] behind his name and I want you to offer
[1:05:16] him up don't you see brothers and
[1:05:18] sisters if I was in God's shoes I would
[1:05:20] think that's a good choice Abraham is a
[1:05:23] good choice his grandparents all behind
[1:05:25] him has a huge
[1:05:28] family but I'm going to choose
[1:05:30] Abraham and I'm going to give him
[1:05:34] Sarah and you know what I'm let turn
[1:05:36] over to Genesis 25 this is in the and
[1:05:39] the Lord is sitting back there thinking
[1:05:41] and you know what I'm going to make it
[1:05:42] even harder because once he gets Isaac
[1:05:45] and once he has that promise son after
[1:05:47] Holding Out for 25 years yeah and Isaac
[1:05:51] grows up and he's going to choose him a
[1:05:52] wife over in Genesis 2519 these are the
[1:05:55] generations of Isaac Abraham's son
[1:05:58] Abraham begot Isaac Isaac was 40 years
[1:06:01] old when he took rebe at a wife the
[1:06:02] daughter of bethuel the Syrian of
[1:06:05] padanam the sister to laan the Syria
[1:06:08] Syrian and Isaac in treated the Lord for
[1:06:11] his
[1:06:12] wife are you with me why because she was
[1:06:17] baren exact come on Abraham your seed is
[1:06:22] going to number as the sand of the sea
[1:06:24] and as the stars of Heaven you're going
[1:06:27] to be a father of Nations great Nations
[1:06:29] Kings will come out of you and you know
[1:06:32] how I want to prove to you it's going to
[1:06:34] be my program I'm going to give you a
[1:06:35] Barren wife and you're finally going to
[1:06:37] get the promised son and guess what he's
[1:06:39] going to get a Barren wife right because
[1:06:43] why God wanted his seed to know it was
[1:06:45] his program right amen that she was not
[1:06:48] able to reproduce
[1:06:50] herself amen and if that wasn't bad
[1:06:53] enough go over to Genesis
[1:06:55] 29 you you know what's next right come
[1:06:59] on Jacob verse 28 fullfilled her week he
[1:07:03] gave him Rachel to wife laan gave to
[1:07:06] Rachel his daughter Billa he went under
[1:07:09] Rachel and he loved also Rachel more
[1:07:11] than Leah served with him yet seven
[1:07:13] other years and when the Lord saw that
[1:07:14] Leah was Barren he opened her womb but
[1:07:19] Jacob's dearly beloved wife Rachel
[1:07:22] was Baron right Abraham I am going to
[1:07:27] make the Nations multiplied right and
[1:07:32] you know I said it the other day when I
[1:07:33] was talking to the home church about
[1:07:35] this you think about that if you were
[1:07:38] Abraham you got Isaac you got the
[1:07:40] promised son now he's running around
[1:07:42] he's growing up at 12 years old you went
[1:07:44] up there to sacrific him the Lord stayed
[1:07:46] your hand all that's behind you you
[1:07:49] would think after all the 25 years of
[1:07:51] frustration that Abraham had the first
[1:07:53] thing he would have been telling Isaac
[1:07:56] is look man whatever you do when you go
[1:07:57] get a
[1:08:00] wife I want you to make sure she can
[1:08:02] have children that's right come
[1:08:04] on now I don't know how they would have
[1:08:06] known back then but but I would think
[1:08:08] that he would be like come on
[1:08:10] Isaac ask around is her family fruitful
[1:08:14] is is but he gets him a wife and she's
[1:08:18] Barren and then you would have thought
[1:08:20] when it come Jacob's turn and he was on
[1:08:21] down the way looking for a wife y
[1:08:24] that that Isaac would have been like wow
[1:08:26] me me and your grandfather Abraham we
[1:08:28] already done been through this yeah we
[1:08:30] done been down this road now I am
[1:08:32] suggesting when you choose a wife check
[1:08:35] it out somehow figure out ask her family
[1:08:38] check around put out some
[1:08:41] feelers see if your wife can have a baby
[1:08:44] or
[1:08:44] not but God In by divine grace and
[1:08:49] Sovereign Grace amen for three
[1:08:51] generations is it a mystery to you now
[1:08:54] why when it got down to the loins of
[1:08:55] Jacob how many were there 70 right and
[1:08:59] they weren't even all out of the the
[1:09:00] barren wife there was Leah's children
[1:09:02] there was the handmaid's children on
[1:09:04] both sides and then there was Joseph the
[1:09:07] promised son amen but God's promise was
[1:09:10] still being fulfilled and that's all I'm
[1:09:12] trying to say to you this morning in the
[1:09:13] face of all that impossibility right in
[1:09:16] the face of all the inability of the
[1:09:18] natural lineage of Abraham to fulfill
[1:09:20] the word the word was still fulfilled
[1:09:24] and those 70 Souls went down there in
[1:09:26] Egypt and they came out of Great and
[1:09:27] Mighty Army and a great nation will I
[1:09:30] build you amen and that's what I'm
[1:09:32] saying to you this morning my dear
[1:09:33] brothers and sisters even though the the
[1:09:36] natural cards were stacked against the
[1:09:38] Fulfillment of the promise the promise
[1:09:40] was going to be three three generations
[1:09:43] of
[1:09:45] barrenness I like something one of the
[1:09:47] commentators said about
[1:09:48] Isaac when and musicians can come if
[1:09:51] they want to come up now one of the one
[1:09:54] of the Jewish writers talked about Isaac
[1:09:56] when him and Rebecca went up there to
[1:09:59] entreat the Lord that they would be
[1:10:00] healed you know where they believe he
[1:10:01] went right back there on Mount Mariah
[1:10:04] where he had where he had been spared
[1:10:06] right they believe that he took Rebecca
[1:10:08] back up on there to mount Mariah and he
[1:10:10] said look honey he said this is where I
[1:10:12] was raised from the dead and the promise
[1:10:15] that God gave to my father Abraham will
[1:10:17] fulfill in us and they entreated the
[1:10:20] Lord and the Lord opened her womb and
[1:10:22] then we get down there to and Jacob
[1:10:24] entreated the Lord and the Lord opened
[1:10:25] her room now that was you know we're
[1:10:28] going to look back and that that's a
[1:10:29] good commentary but it wasn't fun days
[1:10:31] in those days either I mean laan is
[1:10:33] producing the children Rachel is Baron y
[1:10:36] oh my yep aren't you glad you're one of
[1:10:39] them amen aren't you glad that there's a
[1:10:41] Divine commentary written that says I am
[1:10:43] one of them let's stand together and
[1:10:45] sing it there are people almost
