[0:03] god bless you saints
[0:05] you happy to be in church this morning
[0:09] like that song says i woke up this
[0:11] morning feeling fine i woke up with
[0:12] heaven on my mind
[0:19] we've been studying on uh hebrews
[0:21] chapter six
[0:23] and the whole book of hebrews and we've
[0:24] about made it to
[0:26] about made it halfway through uh chapter
[0:28] six
[0:30] so we'll see if we can if we can finish
[0:32] today
[0:33] lord jesus we just ask you lord to bless
[0:36] the reading of your word and our study
[0:37] this morning bless brother wade as he
[0:39] studied preparing back there lord and
[0:40] we'd like we'd ask lord that you'll just
[0:42] answer every need this this morning lord
[0:44] as we come expected and we pray in the
[0:45] name of the lord jesus amen
[0:48] so hebrews chapter six and really
[0:50] hebrews chapter six is talking about
[0:52] anointed ones and those that uh
[0:54] turn back and begin to strike at the
[0:57] word um
[0:59] so hebrews chapter 6 says for it is
[1:01] impossible for those who were once
[1:02] enlightened and have tasted of the
[1:04] heavenly gift
[1:05] and we're made partakers of the holy
[1:07] ghost and have tasted the good word of
[1:09] god and the powers of the world to come
[1:11] if they should fall away to renew them
[1:13] again unto repentance seeing they
[1:15] crucify to themselves the son of god
[1:18] afresh
[1:19] and put him to an open shame
[1:21] for the earth which strengtheneth in the
[1:22] rain that cometh oft upon it and
[1:24] bringeth forth herbs meat for them by
[1:26] whom it is dressed receiveth blessing
[1:28] from god
[1:29] but but that which beareth thorns and
[1:31] briars is rejected and is nigh into
[1:33] cursing whose end is to be burned
[1:38] so paul is talking about he's laying out
[1:40] a scene that we can uh if you just kind
[1:42] of picture that in your mind of of rain
[1:45] falling on the earth and and um
[1:47] and and it brings up different kinds of
[1:49] seeds that been planted all the
[1:51] different kinds of seeds benefit
[1:53] thorns and briars and then the true seed
[1:56] that's been planted
[1:58] but uh it the ones that have
[2:02] that you're going to have some that that
[2:03] that actually come to church and and
[2:05] benefit with the of the holy ghost
[2:07] falling on the people and and they they
[2:09] tasted the word and they they they they
[2:11] benefit from it and they but yet there's
[2:13] there's
[2:14] they don't continue on to the holy ghost
[2:17] so if you
[2:18] if you fall away from that if you turn
[2:20] back
[2:21] and begin to strike back at it and say
[2:24] brother branham's not right and the the
[2:26] messenger from the for the day is not
[2:28] right and those kind of things how can
[2:30] you
[2:31] how can you you actually are crucifying
[2:33] god afresh by ref rejecting the word for
[2:36] your day
[2:37] so how
[2:38] how can uh how can you be if you fall
[2:41] away to renew them against it would be
[2:42] impossible to renew them again to
[2:44] repentance seeing they crucify to
[2:45] themselves the very thing you're
[2:47] crucifying the very thing that would
[2:48] save you and put him to an open shame
[2:52] so brother brown when the message
[2:53] anointed once he talked about you know
[2:55] both but you got brain falling on all
[2:57] these different kinds of people both
[2:58] partake of the same nourishment water
[3:01] and sun both prayed
[3:03] now you think about that both prayed
[3:06] both like like balaam all these examples
[3:08] in in the bible balaam had all the
[3:10] different sacrifices he was it looked
[3:12] like he was doing the same thing cain
[3:14] looked like he was a good religious
[3:16] person
[3:17] both particular the same nourishment
[3:19] water and sun both prayed both received
[3:21] help from god for he maketh his son and
[3:23] reign to fall on both good and evil and
[3:25] though they both had the same wonderful
[3:27] blessing and both had the same wonderful
[3:29] manifestations that will steal that one
[3:31] great difference
[3:32] they were of different seed
[3:34] so the seed is what makes the difference
[3:37] and and in matthew chapter 13 we last
[3:39] time we kind of looked at that parable
[3:41] of the sower that that the the word is
[3:44] sown and and
[3:45] and received in different ways the sun
[3:47] will burn it out and
[3:49] you know somebody will
[3:50] that all the cares of life will choke it
[3:52] out and
[3:53] but if you just hang on to that word and
[3:55] receive it in good ground
[3:57] ground that sometimes is
[3:59] god will get you to a spot where you get
[4:01] that you get
[4:03] take he'll take you to a valley where
[4:05] you you do a a valley of desperation
[4:07] where you begin to realize that
[4:08] something's got to take place in my life
[4:10] i'm tired of the situation that i'm at
[4:13] so jesus is saying that he that
[4:14] receiveth great seed into the good
[4:16] ground is he that heareth the word and
[4:18] understandeth it which also beareth
[4:20] fruit and bringeth forth seven
[4:22] hundredfolds some sixty some thirty
[4:24] and understanding doesn't necessarily
[4:26] mean just with your intellectual mind
[4:28] but understanding this kind of
[4:30] understanding i believe comes from from
[4:32] actually a relationship with jesus
[4:34] christ where he reveals to you what the
[4:36] word is speaking and you don't read it
[4:38] the word necessarily like a newspaper
[4:40] anymore but you're reading it like a
[4:42] love letter
[4:43] where you read between the lines where
[4:45] you read the story of abraham and sarah
[4:46] and
[4:47] you began to read between the lines and
[4:49] see how that their body was changed back
[4:51] and you begin to read between the lines
[4:53] and you begin to understand that all all
[4:56] these all these mysteries that are that
[4:58] are laying there
[4:59] in the bible but you begin to get the
[5:01] sense of it the essence of what the
[5:04] gospel is
[5:05] and how can you get the essence of it
[5:07] unless you have a relationship with
[5:09] christ
[5:10] christ is our absolute he's the one that
[5:12] we're our rock and our foundation
[5:15] and he's the one if you've got if you've
[5:17] got the author of the bible in you he
[5:19] will give you the understanding and give
[5:20] you the sense of what you're reading
[5:23] so you see
[5:24] see the difference is the seed the
[5:26] difference is the seed the revelation of
[5:29] what the bible is about the revelation
[5:31] and the revelation comes by receiving
[5:34] that word and hanging on to it until god
[5:37] can make it manifest in your life
[5:40] so brother brown would say
[5:42] uh or actually this
[5:44] this is the bible jesus jesus said in
[5:46] matthew chapter 7
[5:48] not everyone that saith unto me lord
[5:50] lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[5:51] heaven not everybody that goes to church
[5:53] and cast out devils and preaches the
[5:55] gospel not everybody but he that doeth
[5:57] the will of my father which is in heaven
[5:59] and the will is the word which means the
[6:02] word is that seed so he that doeth the
[6:04] will of my father which is in heaven the
[6:07] will
[6:08] now see if you're walking in the word
[6:10] and you're doing the will of the father
[6:12] then that means that your your life
[6:14] begins to match up right see how it's
[6:16] all tied together with if you have a
[6:17] revelation then acts your works will
[6:21] begin to follow
[6:22] you're going to go to church you're
[6:23] going to pay your tithes you're going to
[6:25] do the things that are required you're
[6:26] going to be baptized the right way
[6:28] you're going to outwardly demonstrate
[6:30] the faith that's on the inside that you
[6:32] have received because the word is
[6:33] becoming real to you so he that doeth
[6:36] the will of my father which is in heaven
[6:38] many will say to me in that day lord
[6:40] lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[6:42] and in thy name i've cast out devils and
[6:44] in thy name done many wonderful works
[6:47] and then i will prophesy profess unto
[6:48] them i never knew you
[6:51] i never have a relationship with you
[6:53] i i never i i never revealed myself to
[6:56] you because you didn't receive my word
[6:59] depart from me you that work iniquity
[7:01] therefore whosoever heareth these
[7:03] sayings of mine and do with them i will
[7:06] liken unto him like him liking him unto
[7:08] a wise man
[7:10] which built his south house upon a rock
[7:14] right there
[7:16] which built his house upon a rock and
[7:18] the rock is the revelation of jesus
[7:19] christ
[7:20] now now you notice in verse 23 it says i
[7:23] never knew you depart from me ye that
[7:25] work iniquity
[7:26] so there's really the problem that we're
[7:28] gonna we're gonna uh maybe take a brief
[7:32] diversion into this uh into into what
[7:34] iniquity means here in just a second
[7:37] and the pergament church age brother and
[7:38] said and there it is you can't claim
[7:40] that manifestation is the evidence of
[7:42] being spirit born spirit-filled no sir
[7:46] i will admit that true manifestation is
[7:49] the evidence of the holy spirit doing
[7:50] mighty acts
[7:52] but it is not the evidence of the
[7:54] individual being spirit-filled even
[7:56] though that individual has an abundance
[7:58] of those manifestations
[8:00] now isn't that interesting
[8:02] that just because you come to church and
[8:04] shout and rejoice and run up and down
[8:05] the aisles that that that's good
[8:08] but that is not the evidence the
[8:10] evidence
[8:11] is that you've received the word for
[8:13] your day
[8:14] and it's manifested in your life with
[8:17] acts following what kind of acts
[8:20] virtue temperance knowledge patience the
[8:23] same kind of acts
[8:25] that were demonstrated in jesus's life
[8:28] because when you believe and it's
[8:30] bottled up on the inside you
[8:32] sooner or later it's going to work
[8:33] itself out and you're going to
[8:35] demonstrate those same acts of a
[8:36] believer you're going to be in church
[8:39] and paying your tithes and doing what a
[8:41] believer does
[8:42] because a believer if christ is living
[8:44] on the inside of you then it can't help
[8:46] but manifest
[8:48] the evidence of receiving the holy ghost
[8:50] today is just the same as it was back in
[8:52] the day of our lord it is receiving the
[8:53] word of truth
[8:55] for the day in which you live
[8:57] jesus never did stress the importance of
[8:59] the works as he did the word
[9:01] he knew that if the people got the word
[9:04] the works would follow
[9:07] if you get the word
[9:09] the works are going to follow
[9:12] so we don't we don't major so much on
[9:14] well
[9:15] because you know the pentecostal the
[9:17] pentecostal ideas let's force something
[9:19] to happen
[9:20] but you get the word and you don't have
[9:22] to force nothing to happen
[9:23] all you got to do is relax and let it
[9:25] automatically happen like a lamb that
[9:27] eats eats grass and boom out it all of a
[9:30] sudden out out comes wool or a little
[9:33] dove that's just eating and eating what
[9:35] is going to eat and and it just
[9:37] naturally produces that oil out of its
[9:38] feathers
[9:40] out of its skin and doesn't have to
[9:42] force nothing to happen at all it just
[9:44] automatically happens
[9:47] so why would they not go on
[9:49] why would you just not go on and why
[9:52] would why would david and corey and all
[9:53] those not go on why would that walk with
[9:56] with moses and saw the actual pillar of
[9:59] fire and the manifestation of the signs
[10:01] and wonders and and all the things that
[10:04] moses demonstrated why would they god
[10:06] not go on
[10:07] now in luke chapter 13 and i got my
[10:10] little diagram of body spirit and soul
[10:12] of a person that's anointed and and in
[10:15] church but an anointed with the baptism
[10:17] of the holy ghost on their spirit
[10:19] but in luke chapter 13 it says jesus
[10:21] said then said one unto him that they
[10:23] were asking jesus lord are there few
[10:25] that be saved
[10:27] and he said unto them strive to enter in
[10:29] at the straight gate for many i say unto
[10:31] you will seek to enter in
[10:33] and shall not be able there's many that
[10:35] come to church but the swinging incense
[10:37] in front of you doesn't save you
[10:39] confessing things to a priest doesn't
[10:40] save you as many come to church and they
[10:42] want to get in but what gets you in is
[10:45] receiving the word for your day
[10:47] when once the master of the house has
[10:49] risen up and has shut to the door and
[10:51] you begin to stand without and to knock
[10:53] at the door saying lord lord open unto
[10:55] us
[10:56] and he shall answer it and say unto you
[10:58] i know not i know you not whence you are
[11:01] i i don't know where you come from i
[11:02] don't i don't recognize you
[11:04] then shall you begin to say we have
[11:06] eaten and drunk in thy presence we we
[11:09] went to church we were there we we felt
[11:11] the baptism in the holy ghost maybe
[11:13] maybe somebody will say that i said and
[11:15] i said in brother branham's camp
[11:17] meetings and and i was there and i saw
[11:19] things moving and i saw the presence of
[11:22] the lord doing things
[11:24] and thou has taught in our streets but
[11:26] he shall say i tell you i know you not
[11:28] when you are depart from me
[11:30] all you workers of iniquity
[11:33] all you workers of iniquity
[11:35] so the problem is iniquity
[11:37] iniquity now iniquity is one of those
[11:40] words that uh we we don't use you know
[11:42] you don't if if you see something wrong
[11:44] in the grocery store when you're
[11:46] standing in the checkout line you're
[11:47] looking at the magazines you don't say
[11:48] look at that iniquity that's not a word
[11:51] that we use commonly that's but but if
[11:53] you really
[11:54] if you want to understand what the
[11:56] bible's talking about and how he was
[11:58] bruised for our iniquities and and he he
[12:00] paid the price for our iniquity you've
[12:02] got to understand if you don't
[12:03] understand what iniquity is then you
[12:05] won't get the sense the essence of what
[12:07] the bible is about
[12:08] because you got to to know that you're
[12:10] born and sin shaping in iniquity
[12:13] that you come that way and you need
[12:15] something to pay the price for that
[12:16] iniquity
[12:17] if you don't know what iniquity is then
[12:19] you don't realize what what situation
[12:21] you're in
[12:22] brother brown will say iniquity
[12:25] i got this picture of a crossroads you
[12:27] got a crossroads and you got evil and
[12:29] good
[12:29] you you got and every one of us are at
[12:31] the crossroads where we we've got a
[12:33] choice laid before us just like just
[12:35] like adam and eve which way you're gonna
[12:37] go
[12:39] the choice was laying before adam and
[12:40] eve don't don't eat from the tree of got
[12:43] knowledge of good and evil don't don't
[12:45] do what god says don't do and they had
[12:47] that choice
[12:48] now
[12:49] when he got to listening to the to the
[12:50] beast that the devil speaking through
[12:52] the beast she began to look at maybe
[12:55] look at things in a different way and
[12:57] think maybe she had a little bit more
[12:58] understanding than her husband did and
[13:00] and and she had that choice presented to
[13:03] her and iniquity got to working what is
[13:06] iniquity to know
[13:08] to know
[13:09] what to do
[13:11] and to go the other way
[13:12] now now think about what a strange thing
[13:14] it is
[13:16] to know what to do if you know what to
[13:19] do and you know what's right and you
[13:21] won't do it that seems like the
[13:24] confession of a madman
[13:26] if you know what to do and you won't do
[13:28] it but yet we were born that way we come
[13:31] into the world because we're a product
[13:33] of that decision
[13:34] that adam and eve made adam knowingly
[13:38] eve
[13:39] deceived into it and and from that from
[13:42] that uh that decision that they made
[13:45] everyone came forth from that shaping
[13:47] that way shaping in iniquity
[13:50] to know what to do and to not do it
[13:53] you think of all the all the decisions
[13:55] all the things that are placed in front
[13:56] of us
[13:57] that you know uh even this morning when
[13:59] you got up you had a decision whether to
[14:01] come to church or not or to you know to
[14:03] to just sit home with your with maybe
[14:06] with your nose running or whatever and
[14:08] say i'm not going to do it you had you
[14:09] had a decision you have a decision
[14:12] whether to pay your tithes or not and
[14:14] see my i use a lot of people get antsy
[14:16] when the preacher starts talking about
[14:18] paying tithes because they think well
[14:19] you're you're pulling for money or or
[14:21] whatnot but
[14:22] you know paying tithes is uh
[14:24] there's a blessing
[14:26] in malachi 3
[14:27] that if you pay tithes he will rebuke
[14:30] the devourer
[14:31] he'll rebuke the devourer so that means
[14:33] when somebody when the economy starts
[14:35] crashing or something or you get laid
[14:37] off then you can lay that before god and
[14:40] say well i did everything you're saying
[14:43] and you can you can you can you have
[14:45] something that you can you can say lord
[14:47] i've done everything that you require
[14:49] now i i come on the scene and fight for
[14:51] me
[14:52] because you promised that you would
[14:53] rebuke the devourer
[14:55] but if you're not paying your tithes
[14:58] then
[14:59] see there's iniquity
[15:01] because you know
[15:02] what to do
[15:04] and you won't do it
[15:05] something that you actually know is
[15:07] right and you won't do it
[15:10] now so so brother ram said workers of
[15:12] iniquity
[15:14] something that you know that you ought
[15:15] to do and will not do it and the
[15:17] international standard bible
[15:18] encyclopedia says not an action
[15:21] but the character of an action so before
[15:24] before you sin before sin comes into the
[15:26] picture there's iniquity so let's
[15:29] picture you at that crossroads and you
[15:31] before you take the first step you got
[15:33] your foot up in the air
[15:34] you're you're thinking
[15:36] i'm not
[15:37] i'm not going to church
[15:40] or or let's do
[15:42] you know you need to be born again and
[15:45] you think i i don't need to be born
[15:47] again
[15:48] and before you take that step
[15:50] there's iniquity
[15:51] because iniquity is what drives the
[15:54] action
[15:55] a new what is iniquity iniquity is
[15:57] it comes from that the the hebrew evol
[16:00] which means crooked or bent like a like
[16:03] an old man that's bent over or a road
[16:05] that's twisted and so
[16:07] iniquity is when you take the truth the
[16:09] correct the correct meaning of the thing
[16:12] the correct actioning
[16:13] and you twist it up so that it means
[16:15] something different now isn't that what
[16:18] he didn't have what the uh the the devil
[16:20] told eve in the garden he took the truth
[16:23] and twisted it up by just adding a
[16:25] little bit extra to it you'll not surely
[16:27] die
[16:28] you'll not surely die
[16:30] and twisted it up and and then iniquity
[16:32] entered the picture and it got it
[16:34] twisted up all the action it twisted up
[16:36] all
[16:37] every everything from that point forward
[16:40] crookedness perverseness evil regarded
[16:43] as that which is not str straight or
[16:45] upright
[16:46] moral distinction
[16:48] to bend
[16:49] make crooked or perverted
[16:52] now see that's what paul's talking about
[16:55] these
[16:55] workers of iniquity that that the the
[16:59] reason they didn't go forward was
[17:00] because there was iniquity in them
[17:06] you think about jesus sitting there
[17:07] talking with nicodemus at night
[17:09] telling him explain to him you need to
[17:12] be born again
[17:14] why would nicodemus not keep going on
[17:17] last next time we find is nicodemus
[17:19] nicodemus there
[17:20] at the cross helping take jesus down off
[17:22] the cross but he didn't wind up at
[17:24] pentecost
[17:26] why would he not keep going on
[17:30] brother brown said what is iniquity
[17:33] it's something that you know that's
[17:34] right and you concede it
[17:37] and won't do it
[17:38] in your heart
[17:40] when you know that that bible teaches a
[17:42] certain thing and you won't do it
[17:44] that's iniquity and david said if i hide
[17:47] iniquity in my heart god will not even
[17:50] hear my prayer
[17:51] why would god hear a prayer of a man
[17:53] that knows he's supposed to do something
[17:55] and down in his heart he's like yeah i
[17:57] should have done that but he won't
[17:58] confess it and make it right
[18:00] but if you repent with a pure and a
[18:03] contract heart lay it out there before
[18:04] god
[18:06] just lay it out there and admit your
[18:07] wrongs that's the heart that god will
[18:09] forgive but if you're holding in there i
[18:11] will i know that i'm doing something
[18:13] wrong but but i'm not going to make it
[18:15] right
[18:16] god won't hear hear that
[18:19] brother brown will say iniquity is
[18:20] something that you going out and you do
[18:22] it and you know you ought to have done
[18:24] it
[18:25] now now look let's keep it in the
[18:27] context of what we're reading hebrews
[18:28] chapter six
[18:30] taste of the good word of god and the
[18:32] powers of the world to come
[18:34] and if they shall fall away to renew
[18:36] them again under repentance
[18:38] this is really the problem the root of
[18:40] the problem what is iniquity iniquity is
[18:43] something that you know that you're
[18:45] doing that you ought not to do and still
[18:47] won't repent of it
[18:48] if i regard iniquity in my heart knowing
[18:50] that i should do it and don't do it then
[18:53] god promised the bible promises that god
[18:55] will not hear your prayer
[18:57] if you know you should do it and won't
[18:58] do it
[19:00] what is iniquity
[19:02] and i just got all these quotes kind of
[19:03] strung together here
[19:05] inequity is something that you know you
[19:07] ought not to do and you do it anyhow
[19:10] iniquity is something that you know that
[19:12] you ought to do and you won't do it you
[19:14] know better but won't do it
[19:17] it's iniquity see
[19:18] you know they should stay with the word
[19:21] of god
[19:22] but for the church's sake
[19:24] or somebody else's sake
[19:26] or something else you'll stray from the
[19:29] word of god
[19:30] and do what the organization says
[19:34] so there we got the sense of what
[19:35] iniquity is when you won't do what the
[19:38] word says because of your pride well i
[19:40] can't do that because i might i don't
[19:42] want to get born again because i don't
[19:44] want my parents to get credit for
[19:45] anything that i've done with my
[19:47] salvation i don't want somebody to see
[19:49] me jump and shout
[19:50] i don't want to preach the truth because
[19:53] my organization stands for it
[19:55] differently or or anything anything that
[19:57] you put in front of the word of god
[20:00] so
[20:01] let's go to this next lie y'all like
[20:03] this
[20:04] these are not quotes for brother randall
[20:06] these are quotes from brother dale
[20:08] this is what brother dale said
[20:12] iniquity is the conceiving part of it
[20:15] the baby is the product the baby is
[20:17] what's brought forth
[20:19] and we've already seen we were products
[20:21] of iniquity the new birth took care of
[20:24] the iniquity for our soul made a way for
[20:26] the body to be redeemed but the body is
[20:28] not yet redeemed is not redeemed yet
[20:30] it's still a product of iniquity
[20:32] and unless you're born again
[20:34] unless you are a christian you are
[20:36] totally a product of iniquity
[20:39] your soul is doomed for a devil's hell
[20:43] so look now you come born in sin shape
[20:46] and iniquity you come the wrong way and
[20:49] you need something to make your soul
[20:51] right
[20:52] you need something to make your spirit
[20:53] right you need something to make your
[20:55] body right but god starts with your soul
[20:59] and every man knows that he's got to be
[21:01] born again by the spirit of god this is
[21:03] what brother brown said you've got to
[21:04] receive the holy ghost so to go away
[21:06] from that and to turn back from it like
[21:09] dathan or cora or judas did is iniquity
[21:12] because you know you need to be born
[21:14] again that's everything just runs up
[21:17] into that
[21:18] the umbrella of all those things is that
[21:21] you've got to be born again because
[21:22] being born again
[21:24] is what takes care of the iniquity
[21:25] problem in your soul you're not even
[21:27] positioned to believe right if you don't
[21:29] have if you're not born again but when
[21:32] god enters into your soul
[21:33] then you start thinking right you start
[21:36] thinking looking at the scripture
[21:37] differently because now that iniquity
[21:39] problems taken care of in your soul
[21:42] look at what the bible says about
[21:43] iniquity in job chapter 34 there is no
[21:46] darkness nor shadow of death where the
[21:47] workers of iniquity may hide themselves
[21:50] in psalm chapter 14 have all the workers
[21:52] of iniquity no knowledge who eat of my
[21:55] people as they eat bread and call not
[21:56] upon the lord
[21:58] in psalm 37 a psalm of david frett not
[22:01] thyself
[22:02] because of evil doers
[22:04] neither neither be thou envious
[22:06] against the workers of iniquity
[22:08] somebody that knows what the right path
[22:11] is to take but they won't do it
[22:13] the way of the lord is strength to the
[22:15] upright but destruction shall be to the
[22:17] workers of iniquity
[22:20] draw me not away with the wicked and
[22:21] with the workers of iniquity which speak
[22:24] peace to their neighbors but mischief
[22:27] is in their hearts
[22:29] because they know the right way to go
[22:32] but they won't do it
[22:36] in luke 13 he said but he shall not say
[22:39] i tell you i know you not whence you are
[22:41] depart from me all you workers of
[22:43] iniquity
[22:44] and in second thessalonians remember you
[22:47] not that when i was yet with you i told
[22:49] you these things
[22:50] and now you know that with what
[22:52] withholdeth that he might be revealed in
[22:53] his time for the mystery of iniquity
[22:56] does already work now what's the mystery
[22:58] of iniquity deception
[23:01] you know it's it's the devil working and
[23:04] starting off in a little baby form where
[23:06] eventually he winds up well there's
[23:07] there's iniquity
[23:09] and maturity but the iniquity iniquity
[23:12] is deception
[23:13] iniquity is is a lie something to
[23:16] deceive you with
[23:18] to make you do
[23:20] what you know the opposite of what you
[23:23] know to do now now look let's just tie
[23:25] in daniel 9 70 weeks are coming upon thy
[23:27] people and upon thy holy city to finish
[23:30] their transgression and to make an end
[23:31] of sins and to make reconciliation for
[23:34] iniquity
[23:35] and see the jews need something
[23:37] something an antidote for their iniquity
[23:40] and there's another quote for brother
[23:41] dale
[23:42] when they see him incarnate
[23:44] that proves that their iniquity
[23:47] is gone
[23:52] and leadership brother ram said many of
[23:54] you think i got the baptism the holy
[23:55] ghost i'm going to heaven
[23:57] that don't mean one thing that you're
[23:59] going to heaven you can have the baptism
[24:01] of the holy ghost every hour in your
[24:03] life
[24:04] and still be lost and go to hell
[24:07] how can that be
[24:09] if you've still got iniquity in your
[24:10] heart
[24:12] and you won't receive the word for your
[24:13] day you won't do what god says for you
[24:16] to do if you've got iniquity and you
[24:18] know that you need to be baptized but
[24:20] you won't do it or you know that you
[24:22] need to be born again it doesn't matter
[24:25] if you're baptist baptized with the holy
[24:26] ghost in your spirit on your flesh it
[24:29] doesn't matter because down on the
[24:31] inside
[24:32] of your soul the thing that drives your
[24:34] being the thing that that that that
[24:36] drives the course of your life
[24:38] there's something wrong
[24:43] you look at this diagram of a believer
[24:45] on the left
[24:46] there's a i got a little a little
[24:48] serpent down in the bottom of that uh
[24:50] and on the inside of the soul with in
[24:52] the body and spirit you could be
[24:53] anointed but there's there's something
[24:55] wrong on the inside but
[24:58] but when you receive the word for your
[25:00] age and it's quicken it lights up that
[25:03] that soul
[25:04] drives out the iniquity changes that
[25:06] heart so you're positioned to believe
[25:08] and you begin reading the bible
[25:10] differently
[25:14] but you you know god the the the what
[25:16] god and i'm i'm going to wrap up here in
[25:18] just a minute but god wants to take over
[25:20] all of your soul and your spirit and
[25:22] your body and that message the door to
[25:24] the heart he said you want him as a
[25:25] savior but what about him being your
[25:27] lord that'll control you control your
[25:29] emotions control your thinking control
[25:31] your every fiber of you that you could
[25:34] say like the man years ago who led him
[25:35] in for me to live as christ
[25:38] and to die is gain
[25:41] so brother adam would say and the
[25:42] anointing ones at the end time he said
[25:43] what is iniquity
[25:47] it's something that you know you ought
[25:48] to do and you won't do it
[25:50] they know that word
[25:52] they hear it you're listening to this
[25:54] tape you're listening to this message
[25:58] that's a strong statement right there
[26:00] somebody be listening to the same
[26:02] message
[26:03] but yes have something something askew
[26:06] in their heart
[26:08] you see the lord god said so
[26:10] you see him confirm it make it true
[26:13] and you know this just as plain as the
[26:15] sun is shining outside
[26:17] but you that'll hold on to your
[26:19] denomination the musicians can go ahead
[26:20] and come forward hold on to those false
[26:23] things you worker of iniquity
[26:26] oh yeah i did i had great campaigns i'd
[26:29] done this i'd done that said you depart
[26:31] from me you worker of iniquity i never
[26:33] knew you well the holy ghost fell on me
[26:35] i don't doubt that a bit
[26:37] i spoke in tongues i sing in the spirit
[26:39] i don't doubt that'll be it no question
[26:41] of that old brother sister what kind of
[26:43] a condition
[26:45] this is a trembling time
[26:47] where we at
[26:49] this word is coming to life now
[26:52] god bless you thanks
[26:54] [Applause]
[27:14] you
