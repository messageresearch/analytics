[18:45] that we haven't read but 11 times so far
[18:48] so well I thought well we're going to
[18:50] end this today
[18:52] sitting in there now I got about eight
[18:54] more sermons okay so you know it just
[18:57] goes out of way but we're going to first
[18:59] Peter 1:13 and then we'll go over to
[19:06] revelations 3:21 okay father we thank
[19:16] you for this day and the opportunity to
[19:18] be able to fellowship together around
[19:20] your word we pray that you'd be with us
[19:22] and got each and every one of us and
[19:24] Lord open our eyes to not understanding
[19:27] that we might walk in your love in your
[19:29] grace be with each one remember brother
[19:32] dougherty's our Lord touch his eyesight
[19:34] and just remember all the other
[19:36] sicknesses among us remember a wife Lord
[19:38] and having the problem with the sinuses
[19:40] and congestion 'z and the things and
[19:42] Lourdes little Abbey with ear infection
[19:46] and for the owl
[19:47] Lord and just many of us that are sick
[19:50] you said you sent your word and healed
[19:52] us so we believe you just have your way
[19:55] now forgive our sins cleanse us and got
[19:58] us in Jesus name Amen
[20:01] okay and we've read this before and what
[20:05] it is it's coming down to a point to
[20:08] establishing something that I believe is
[20:12] taking place in this day I remember my
[20:16] whole emphasis whole point out of
[20:21] messages has been one thing to try to
[20:25] get us to look at things more positive
[20:30] to look at what we're doing look at
[20:35] today in the hour we're following we can
[20:38] look out there and see the world and how
[20:39] it's falling we could say all those
[20:41] things but that is not going to put us
[20:43] in the rapture I don't care who what
[20:47] goes on out dire its the revealed word
[20:50] that is the thing that we need all right
[20:53] so that's doing that and it's getting to
[20:56] the point of what present tense right
[21:01] you remember what the prophets said I'll
[21:03] review this in a minute say it to 15
[21:05] times all right our problem is looking
[21:08] back and looking forward he said that's
[21:15] where Satan's tactic was to get us to
[21:18] look backward or look forward and not
[21:20] look at what's taking place right now
[21:23] you say but brother Dale I don't see
[21:27] much going on open your eyes you can
[21:31] read the newspaper and see what's going
[21:33] on well you know if that's going on
[21:35] there has to be something taking place
[21:38] in the bride all right no what did the
[21:40] prophets say when the bride realizes who
[21:43] she is and what she's here for Satan
[21:46] will be powerless before her oh that's a
[21:52] simple statement in there okay but just
[21:54] remember that we're for a gird up the
[21:58] loins of your mind be sober and hope to
[22:01] the end for the grace that is to be
[22:03] brought unto you at the revelation of
[22:07] Jesus Christ now at the end time to
[22:11] where the Word of God is fully revealed
[22:13] is that what he said all right now let's
[22:17] go to Revelation 3:21
[22:20] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[22:23] sit with me in my throne even as I also
[22:27] overcame and I'm set down with my father
[22:29] in his throne he that hath an ear let
[22:32] him hear what the spirit saith
[22:35] unto the churches you may be seated the
[22:37] Lord at his blessing to the reading of
[22:40] the word now as I said what has been our
[22:44] point why is it that we cannot stay on
[22:53] the level that the prophet left when he
[22:57] was here now I say that with respect to
[23:01] the point of what I'm talking about
[23:02] I believe if anybody ever had a positive
[23:05] attitude all right not talking about our
[23:09] day in people in times you know I
[23:11] believe it was the Prophet don't you
[23:14] that everything was positive with him it
[23:17] was never negative
[23:19] it was always positive to you okay now
[23:23] and if that now that didn't do away with
[23:25] his heart aches and troubles as a matter
[23:29] of fact that brought more of them that
[23:31] created a lot of problems but a positive
[23:35] attitude is the thing that we all need
[23:38] and why not we're 50 years almost or
[23:42] something heists the going of the
[23:44] Prophet all right as I kept emphasizing
[23:47] why did the children of Israel have to
[23:50] stay 40 more years or 30 technically and
[23:53] down in Egypt was because they had
[23:57] turned down the word that had been
[24:00] brought to him right now
[24:03] could it be that that's what's happening
[24:05] now or is God given an opportunity for
[24:09] mankind to turn it down and it sure
[24:11] looks like they're doing it because what
[24:13] used to be even on your Internet's and
[24:18] things of great things you know I'll
[24:20] catch the vid not that what does the
[24:23] other one bleed the sign oh boy great
[24:26] brother branham was a prophet everything
[24:27] was great all that once brought around
[24:31] as a false prophet
[24:33] now that's according to them you going
[24:36] the internet now and they see what
[24:37] they're doing to this message now then
[24:40] the message is fine it's what we're
[24:42] doing with it
[24:44] all right it's what we're doing is
[24:46] messing everything up so that we don't
[24:49] need our folks all right 50 years we've
[24:54] been here because of you and me with
[25:00] brother Dale I've been alright you know
[25:05] I'm just sitting telling it like it is
[25:08] we don't have 50 more years
[25:11] a few more we're gonna be in a nursing
[25:13] home if possible you know but I want to
[25:23] get out of here don't you all right
[25:26] I want to believe what has been brought
[25:28] unto us so what did the Prophet bring
[25:31] recognizing your day and its message all
[25:36] right there shouldn't be any problem to
[25:39] recognize the the fact that God has sent
[25:42] a prophet that shouldn't be any problem
[25:45] there's witnesses sitting here that was
[25:48] Darwin the Dead was raised the sick was
[25:51] healed and things like that to the word
[25:53] you know by the prophets ministry all
[25:56] right so I'm sitting here that was dark
[25:58] all right
[25:59] we don't have we've got witnesses living
[26:02] witnesses still unto that day as being
[26:05] true you know all right now then the
[26:10] problem must be in the basis that we're
[26:13] not accepting what God has declared for
[26:18] the day that we're living you know we're
[26:21] not accepting who we are and what we're
[26:24] here for
[26:25] thank God did he sent us a prophet amen
[26:28] but that didn't finish it all there's
[26:31] got to be a bride who becomes the word
[26:35] all right and not to just read it not to
[26:41] be able to quote it okay but for it to
[26:45] be a living reality in our hearts and
[26:48] our lives and that's been my whole point
[26:50] just to try to get us to see if we are
[26:55] the bride
[26:57] then when are we going to start walking
[26:59] in the light of the bride that now I'm
[27:02] not folks I'm not this way well I I
[27:05] think one of these days something's
[27:07] gonna happen make us get desperate
[27:09] you better get desperate down I mean you
[27:15] said well it's gonna bring desperation
[27:17] is gonna put us where we need to be
[27:21] let me quote your prophet all right we
[27:24] believe him what is supposed to bring to
[27:28] pass the things upon the bride if you're
[27:36] looking for persecutions and things to
[27:38] happen what's supposed to bring it I
[27:40] thought it was the readiness of the
[27:43] bride I thought it was the bride when
[27:45] she begins to realize who she is then
[27:48] that out there it's already set in
[27:50] motion but then it's gonna come after
[27:52] the bride but it's because the bride has
[27:56] realized who she is what she's doing all
[27:58] right see then we start should start
[28:02] saying thank you lord you know for
[28:05] giving me what you have given me the
[28:07] message that I can can study it and
[28:09] believe it all right now get that point
[28:12] across and we'll move on now so we've
[28:16] come up through the church ages we
[28:18] started to lose series about nine or ten
[28:21] messages ago on the seven church ages
[28:25] all right and bringing up those ages
[28:29] give you a Feist run through to the
[28:32] visitors and I ask you to read the
[28:35] church ages and you'll see what is each
[28:37] one you'll find four things that happens
[28:42] in each church age and if you'll read it
[28:45] you'll see each church age has those
[28:47] four things all right so it's a pattern
[28:50] or a layout of the way God does things
[28:53] first he'll always tell the church who
[28:58] is the unto the Angel of the Church of
[29:02] this unto the angel Church then he'll
[29:06] say the saith the Amen the faithful and
[29:08] true witness all right so number one is
[29:11] what always he tells who he is
[29:15] okay second now they may not be laid
[29:19] perfectly in order to read them but
[29:22] they'll be in each search aid the second
[29:24] thing we talked about was the fact of
[29:27] God would praise his people for their
[29:32] stand for the word he saves had a praise
[29:36] or has praised - showing the the fact of
[29:41] what each age is going through now he
[29:44] said what each overcomer will relate to
[29:46] that age we have we we're not trying to
[29:49] drag this out of trying to cut it short
[29:52] but see each age there overcomer will be
[29:56] related to the age of what's taking
[29:58] place all right no number one he shows
[30:01] the church who he is
[30:03] number two never aged now you read it
[30:07] number two he praises that church broad
[30:10] let me say bride because you know the
[30:13] Prophet uses church a lot but let me say
[30:16] bride all right number three he rebukes
[30:20] every age for leaving the word for the
[30:25] things they have among them for the
[30:28] things that are that has been brought
[30:30] you said but the bride now there's word
[30:32] that we go into you know we go in the
[30:34] message people well and I've heard this
[30:36] - God didn't rebuke that true bride if I
[30:43] knew I'd read a little bit I mean they
[30:46] something wrong you're reading he
[30:48] rebukes the true bride just as well as
[30:51] he rebukes the false bride God because
[30:56] he rebukes him for getting away from the
[30:58] word oh no they stayed with the word no
[31:00] now you're in bad shape because I got
[31:04] pretty good remember of natural thing
[31:06] you know we used to basically all be
[31:09] tied up and organized religion somewhere
[31:11] following somebody or somebodies twisted
[31:14] up for thoughts and Trinities and no
[31:17] eternal hills and ideals like that so
[31:20] don't think we've come down through
[31:21] there as a goody two-shoes now he
[31:24] rebukes ever
[31:25] age for getting away from the Word of
[31:26] God all right so what does he do
[31:30] first tells who he is second he praises
[31:32] the church third he rebukes them but
[31:35] that's not the end of it because every
[31:38] age every age it ends with an overcomer
[31:43] and telling that overcomer what a great
[31:47] opportunity it is to be in Christ for
[31:49] that day in time that you're living and
[31:51] he shows these age what their
[31:54] inheritance is all right there's your
[31:58] four things now each age will do that
[32:01] you read it then you read the next stage
[32:04] the next day all right it's a pattern
[32:06] that God lays down to wear that we can
[32:09] follow and see where we're at now you
[32:13] get to the seventh church age there's
[32:15] very little preysing
[32:17] now each starts off telling that he's
[32:20] the beginning of the creation of God
[32:22] revelation 3:14 next he does a little
[32:26] praise of the bride coming through but
[32:29] not as much praising as the previous
[32:32] ages a lot of times because look how far
[32:35] we have gotten away from the truth so
[32:38] perverted and so twisted up until you
[32:42] know there was hardly anything left
[32:44] until he wound up being were you say
[32:47] don't rebuke they will how come he's
[32:49] knocking at the door of the bride trying
[32:53] to get back into his bride right so it's
[32:58] a it's always telling who he is telling
[33:03] the point of praise telling the point of
[33:07] rebuking but then telling to the
[33:09] overcomer what what each overcomer
[33:12] expects you remember how we started the
[33:15] series
[33:16] to me it's marvelous that before he even
[33:20] started writing to the church ages you
[33:24] remember what that was chapter one he
[33:28] spends verse 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 or 11
[33:32] all pray telling who he is
[33:38] now what's the next thing verse 12 13
[33:42] going on to that one standing in the
[33:44] midst of seven golden candlesticks like
[33:46] unto the Son of Man Girt about the paps
[33:48] with a golden girdle that's God in broad
[33:51] form feminist perhaps but you know God
[33:56] in right and in broad form alright so
[34:02] here was my point and it's always been
[34:04] before he starts anything of the book of
[34:06] Revelation you would have you would
[34:08] agree at least that the book of
[34:10] Revelation shows the most horrible
[34:12] things that art will take place in this
[34:15] day right you know you got your floods
[34:19] you've got your earthquakes you've got
[34:20] all of your things you got all of the
[34:22] world falling apart everything coming to
[34:24] an end all of that is in the Book of
[34:26] Revelations but before he starts telling
[34:29] all of that he tells you how perfect the
[34:31] bride is you remember that that before
[34:36] he starts telling all the bad thing he
[34:38] tells you how perfect you are all right
[34:42] then he writes the ages and the finality
[34:45] of each age is to the overcomer of that
[34:49] age and what they're going to inherit
[34:54] all right to the overcomer they're going
[34:58] to inherit certain things alright now
[35:03] here's the point you remember he said
[35:08] that each church age inherits what to
[35:13] proceed in church age brought forth now
[35:18] proceeding means to go forward but don't
[35:20] get tied up with it if you look it up
[35:22] Webster it can go backward alright so
[35:26] that's a perfect word that he used the
[35:28] Prophet used that to say each church age
[35:31] inherits what the previous age gets with
[35:38] it'll also hold hold what the future
[35:41] ages will get and then we're gonna read
[35:45] scripture in a minute and then you'll
[35:46] see what I'm talking about
[35:48] but get the point each age inherits the
[35:54] same as the other now listen listen to
[35:57] I'll try to explain something and and I
[36:00] get tangled up in it there's a human
[36:02] being but I believe that there's degrees
[36:05] in the body of Christ you you agree with
[36:08] that there's degrees in the body where
[36:10] everybody's not at the same level same
[36:13] point or same taller it's according to
[36:16] our abilities it's according to our
[36:19] amount of word that we've been able to
[36:22] hear it's according to what and and each
[36:25] one of us can be at a different level
[36:27] and different thoughts you get the
[36:28] Statue of a perfect man see you've got
[36:31] people all the way up through here okay
[36:35] are you listening then that that way
[36:39] we're not on the same level of
[36:44] understanding because that's normal I
[36:47] mean you run an IQ in here and what we'd
[36:51] have you'd have from my body part mine
[36:54] on the bottom all the way up to the top
[36:56] you know because I figure I'd be the
[36:58] lowest IQ in the crowd because that
[37:01] would be that's this truth all right see
[37:04] we're not the same all right now now
[37:06] don't get misunderstand when I'm talking
[37:08] about the proceeding aids inherit what
[37:11] this aids gets or that age over here
[37:13] gets what this aids get and we all come
[37:15] out to be to where that we inherit all
[37:18] things all right now so you didn't
[37:25] understand what I'm getting at so you
[37:28] take the ages and you get the first
[37:31] church age to the overcomer that age he
[37:34] has a right to eat of the Tree of Life
[37:36] which is in the paradise of God second
[37:40] church age he gets a crown of life and
[37:44] he's not to be hurt with the second
[37:46] death third church age he gets to eat of
[37:49] the hidden manna a new name written
[37:51] within that all right fourth age power
[37:57] over the nation's give him the morning
[38:00] star
[38:01] yeah future change clothed with white
[38:05] raiment I'll confess his name before my
[38:08] father six church age pillar of the in
[38:12] the temple of my god you coma no more
[38:15] out and I'll ride up on him my new name
[38:18] seventh sit with me in my throne as I
[38:23] overcame and sit with him and his strong
[38:26] all right now those things Darnell is
[38:31] not talking about your education
[38:33] abilities
[38:35] all right you following me it's not
[38:37] talking about where you are in the basis
[38:42] of what stage you are in Christianity or
[38:46] anything like that
[38:47] I hope you understand what I'm talking
[38:49] about that goes with that point that
[38:51] that's according to our abilities you
[38:54] know allows us to be but when you're
[38:56] talking about the church ages now each
[39:01] church age gets the new birth you agree
[39:07] no matter what church age it is each
[39:10] church age gets the new birth all right
[39:13] so now each church age then would have
[39:16] these things laid in front of it
[39:20] to be for the overcomer sure the part of
[39:25] the overcomer has related to the age
[39:27] that you're in okay that's to the
[39:31] overcomer in the age you're in that's
[39:34] related to that in the morning stars
[39:36] because the so and so because of this
[39:39] alright but understand what I'm saying
[39:42] it's not talking about your growth
[39:45] development as much as it's talking
[39:47] about what you are given
[39:51] think about it then the think about a
[39:56] wonderful age that we live in we just
[40:01] don't get to sit in his throne that's
[40:04] wonderful
[40:05] that's great but we get white raiment
[40:13] and your name confession before the
[40:14] Angels you get to eat of the hidden
[40:17] manna you get a new name you'll not be
[40:24] heard of the second death I mean is that
[40:27] the only age where it says number two
[40:29] age says you won't be heard of the Santa
[40:31] you mean all the rest I'm gonna let you
[40:32] be hurt of the second death no that's
[40:34] not the emphasis the emphasis as each
[40:37] age gets all of these things that was
[40:41] where we kind of ending up the point to
[40:43] talk about the first agents you get to
[40:45] eat of the Tree of Life which is in the
[40:46] paradise of God see everybody gets that
[40:50] ever born-again believer gets a right to
[40:54] the Tree of Life
[40:55] every born-again believer gets a right
[40:58] to these things that the others are
[41:02] counted overcomer but like I said the
[41:04] main thing of you dealing with overcomer
[41:07] maybe I should take 1015 messages on
[41:10] that but you know the main thing you're
[41:13] talking about the overcomer is this in
[41:16] relation to the age it's in relation to
[41:20] the bad it's not in relation to your new
[41:24] birth you have the new birth if you have
[41:28] the do burfi don't you are in age and
[41:31] got the problem but if you've got the
[41:33] new birth all right
[41:36] you will one day maybe not as daebak
[41:40] that maybe they didn't understand that
[41:44] maybe they didn't understand what they
[41:46] were getting but to you and me in this
[41:51] age we are supposed to have the complete
[41:56] revelation of Jesus Christ as we keep
[41:58] reading from 1st Peter at the revelation
[42:02] of Jesus Christ at the revelation of the
[42:05] full word at the completion of all
[42:08] things we should come forth to say hey
[42:13] I've been able to either the tree of
[42:15] life is this message the tree of life
[42:21] did he put us into the paradise of God
[42:25] by the new birth won't be hurt in a
[42:30] second death
[42:34] we can either the hidden manna we can be
[42:40] a pillar in the temple of God that's the
[42:42] six churches coming forth getting ready
[42:44] for the seventh and listen what is that
[42:47] what is the pillar in the temple of my
[42:49] god but a resin said it's a revelation
[42:53] of Jesus Christ coming forth in that
[42:56] sixth church age as the name being
[42:59] restored right six church age the name
[43:05] is coming back really it starts back in
[43:07] the fifth because it winds up with a
[43:11] name David and they're dead but yet that
[43:13] means there's something fixing to come
[43:15] forth and that six church age brought
[43:17] forth the pillar in the temple of my god
[43:20] what a revelation of Jesus Christ what
[43:24] are we talking about I got one in here
[43:25] where the Prophet said it what are we
[43:27] talking about what are all these things
[43:30] the revelation of Jesus Christ and where
[43:34] he's at and what he's doing and the
[43:36] overcomer in relations are said to the
[43:38] aged read then they overcome under each
[43:41] age get to church age book read what the
[43:44] Prophet says about that in relation to
[43:46] the age you're living all right now you
[43:52] following me get it in the relation of
[43:56] the age that you're living so what would
[43:59] be the greatest of all revelations that
[44:01] would wind up in this seventh church age
[44:06] even though it's the worst of all ages
[44:10] even though it's the the most horrible
[44:13] of every age the most deceptive the most
[44:16] you know spiritually speaking of a
[44:19] literacy you know not having knowledge
[44:23] of what's taking place is what I mean
[44:27] and coming to the point of in this age
[44:36] to be able to get to it this morning I
[44:37] know but remember in this age we come to
[44:41] be able to see how that we sit in the
[44:45] throne
[44:46] not on the throne there's only one we're
[44:55] going to Revelation 4:1 so you can go
[44:56] ahead and read it and get ready there's
[45:01] only one on the throne in Revelation 4:1
[45:07] there's not a bunch of people sitting up
[45:09] on the throne well get all that out of
[45:12] your mind it's a revelation of Jesus
[45:14] Christ
[45:16] let her run him in what in the seal book
[45:19] where he says that lamb takes the book
[45:21] climbs up on the throne I believe it's
[45:23] in the sealed book right and sits down
[45:24] right Loretta said he becomes the one on
[45:31] the throne he said what is that
[45:33] he says the revelation of Jesus Christ
[45:37] it's not a troll' and a place to sit I'm
[45:42] serious I don't care about sitting on
[45:44] the throne with him you know maybe
[45:48] that's carnal to you and you don't like
[45:50] it but that's me as a human I don't want
[45:54] to sit on the throne none of us have any
[45:58] right and listen we have no right as
[46:01] human beings to consider the point of
[46:03] trying to sit on the throne with him
[46:07] what would give us the right to sit down
[46:11] no one has the right to sit there he's
[46:15] died by himself revelations 4:1
[46:18] revelation 5 the lamb comes forth takes
[46:24] the book out of the hand of the one
[46:25] sitting on the throne what now and
[46:27] climbs up on the throne and sits down
[46:29] and said I'm the one that did it
[46:32] there are we in the message what are you
[46:36] listening each age inherits the previous
[46:40] age or even the preceding could get
[46:42] something they will get it eventually
[46:45] maybe they didn't understand in the day
[46:49] they
[46:49] living let's try to emphasize that a
[46:52] minute ago maybe they didn't follow that
[46:54] maybe they couldn't understand because
[46:57] you can see them with Trinity doctrines
[46:58] you can see how kind but yet still God
[47:00] never took him away from being his
[47:08] children Martin Luther might have been a
[47:12] Trinitarian to the core of all kind of
[47:16] books you know about him is what is his
[47:19] teachings but yet he wasn't thrown out
[47:24] of the kingdom so when the life stage
[47:28] gets to the overcomer of the life stage
[47:30] you see the overcomer of that age as I
[47:35] read anything the overcomer of that age
[47:39] gets to either the tree of life which is
[47:43] this message that we're devouring he's
[47:46] not going to be hurt with a second death
[47:48] cause he's gonna get a crown of life he
[47:52] gets to eat of the hidden manna the
[47:54] secret mysteries of the entire Bible he
[48:00] has power over the nation's because he's
[48:02] given it to you you've given the
[48:06] Morningstar
[48:07] good morning stars Jesus Christ is it
[48:11] gonna give you stars they're gonna give
[48:12] you a monitor no all of these is
[48:14] revelations about Jesus Christ you be
[48:21] clothed in white raiment but everybody
[48:25] gets clothed in white raiment all bride
[48:29] right and he'll confess our name will be
[48:38] in the pillar of the temple of my god
[48:39] what a run City taking brought back to
[48:41] the foundation of the apostles and
[48:44] prophets
[48:44] that's the pillar in the temple of God
[48:47] see he take heed back to the revelation
[48:51] it's not a building sitting out to her
[48:52] it's not a pushing a stone in a corner
[48:55] you say your carnal well is that
[48:59] striking Oh
[49:02] that I may be talking about me and you
[49:06] remember I don't preach somewheres else
[49:08] I'm not preaching to the Internet
[49:10] that's because they just get in if they
[49:13] won't it I'm preaching to what sitting
[49:15] right here today trying to get us to see
[49:20] who we are but what is the life's
[49:23] revelation that we read from revelations
[49:28] 321 sit with me in my throne all right
[49:39] not only strong though we're not trying
[49:42] to be that you remember the lady asked
[49:46] can my son sit on one side of the and on
[49:50] the other side of thee in your kingdom
[49:54] cause now listen what's he saying he
[49:58] said what a woman would have in her
[49:59] heart for her children to do that all
[50:02] right
[50:02] that's wonderful but just remember one
[50:05] time she was looking at something
[50:08] natural right she was looking at the
[50:14] natural instead of the spiritual she
[50:18] wanted one son to sit on one side of him
[50:21] and the other one said on the other now
[50:24] watch that can't be done because that
[50:29] puts somebody on the throne are you
[50:33] listening so he told her he said now
[50:38] it's not for me to give that right
[50:43] that's what Jesus told the lady little
[50:45] random said that trial our test had
[50:49] never come into being yet but it said it
[50:53] will and somebody will be able to do
[50:57] that not sit on his throne now we walk
[51:03] into the real truth evident one it's not
[51:05] only a strong prophet said it no that's
[51:08] not what it is it's in his throne a lot
[51:12] of difference in sitting in his throne
[51:13] and only strong
[51:15] always thrown you're gonna have problem
[51:18] because they can't be but one on that
[51:20] throne Oh wait'll we get down one of
[51:25] these days it'll strike home and you
[51:28] realize that someday I'm gonna say this
[51:31] this say it and then back away from it
[51:33] completely
[51:33] oh there's dozen messages down the road
[51:36] do you realize that one of these days
[51:40] the Sun ship will terminate oh I'm in
[51:49] the scripture and in the prophets
[51:50] message let's see if you can handle it
[51:52] so as I always say swallow take a good
[51:56] deep breath I'm not gonna say no more
[51:58] about it but you've got a time to think
[52:01] it over that the Sun will become subject
[52:09] they never will be but one on the throne
[52:13] they ain't gonna be no father and the
[52:16] Son and the Holy Spirit sitting on the
[52:19] throne yeah we got a long ways to go
[52:24] help me okay now listen that's off the
[52:29] message how can I overcome to make sure
[52:31] that everybody gets it on the Internet
[52:33] where he says each age the one preceding
[52:39] it in her it's all that the other one's
[52:43] offered alright so it doesn't matter
[52:47] whether it's forward or backward it
[52:50] doesn't matter if you're in the middle
[52:51] church age and you're going backwards or
[52:53] forward that's why I know I'm so carnal
[52:55] and that's what gets me everybody says
[52:57] brother Dale is so deep enough I'm so
[53:00] carnal until it's pitiful because you
[53:05] know how carnal I think everybody wants
[53:09] Alpha and Omega for the church ages he's
[53:13] how fun he's Omega and he's nothing in
[53:15] between my prophet said he's everything
[53:20] that's in between now he's when it made
[53:22] the statements there's nothing in
[53:23] between
[53:23] because there is nothing between Alpha
[53:25] and Omega it's the same God
[53:28] being Raviv but that's how carnal I get
[53:31] now looking at the it's a candlestick
[53:36] which would be the greatest age you'd
[53:38] never begin scripturally speaking if
[53:41] you're gonna take it literal and
[53:42] compound
[53:43] I'd rather been in the middle age which
[53:47] would be here right one two three and
[53:50] one two three yeah talk to our
[53:52] temperance
[53:54] he said what because the Bible says that
[53:59] he's in the midst of the seven golden
[54:01] candlesticks
[54:03] does that mean he's more in the middle
[54:06] or is he more in the beginning or is he
[54:08] more in the ending or or is it all of
[54:11] this and everybody preaches that he's
[54:12] Alpha and Omega and nothing in between
[54:19] that's the way they appreciate he's all
[54:23] that's in between he's everything so if
[54:29] you're gonna be carnal I'll be carnal
[54:31] with you so the Bible said he's in the
[54:34] midst so that would mean he's more in
[54:36] the tottering age than anywhere else not
[54:39] a rock he's the same in every age
[54:43] according to your prophet notice the
[54:45] Holy Ghost the Prophet said in every age
[54:47] right and the Holy Ghost is the same now
[54:51] who he's working through might be
[54:53] degreed because if they cannot have the
[54:55] ability to understand the word but he's
[54:57] still in every church age he's in the
[54:59] midst and each church age just keeps it
[55:04] keeps piling up until this age then what
[55:07] a wonderful statement to make to this
[55:08] age what a wonderful thing to come to
[55:15] this age and say
[55:19] to him that overcometh
[55:25] know what a horrible age to overcome but
[55:30] Brennan said one day they overcome soft
[55:32] living you know that's one of the things
[55:35] you think it ain't ain't none of us
[55:38] wanted to walk home you go over in
[55:41] Jamaica and it's raining and it's doing
[55:45] everything in the book and there's two
[55:47] 300 people sitting in a building and
[55:49] half of them are three-quarters of them
[55:51] had to walk to get there make us ashamed
[55:55] of herself and they're there rain sleet
[55:59] or whatever they're there now these
[56:02] brothers has been there they and witness
[56:04] to that and see whether the Lewis has
[56:06] been a lot of places were the biggest
[56:08] ports and the people had to walk get to
[56:10] church but you talk about when it shows
[56:13] up knowing that day they remember I
[56:15] don't believe I believe the Bible the
[56:20] Bible says we're all gonna stand before
[56:22] the judgment seat of Christ not the
[56:25] white throne no don't go wrong it ain't
[56:29] the white throne we stand before but
[56:31] we're gonna stand before the judge the
[56:33] deeds done in the body whether good or
[56:35] bad and yet you can lay out of church in
[56:39] time you want to and just justified well
[56:42] well we'll listen to the tape I don't
[56:47] ask for a raise of hand because it's the
[56:51] embarrassing how many of you listen to
[56:54] every service
[57:01] I listen to my own self two or three
[57:03] times a week me in a while or preach the
[57:06] next week I listen to or three time
[57:10] sometimes I learned from ownself and I
[57:16] sit there and Luke said Lord that was a
[57:17] good thought I'm glad you brought that
[57:20] in out okay forget it
[57:24] but listen what does it mean to sit in
[57:29] his throne instead of on sitting on
[57:31] that's easy to understand could you just
[57:33] climb up these chairs and you drive
[57:34] around but there's no such thing now
[57:36] here's one there's no seats the seats
[57:39] out around is left sure it's for the for
[57:42] you and me but it's not up on a throne
[57:44] it's not up on a platform as we'd call
[57:46] it a throne you know said no the 24
[57:50] elders are all around all the seven you
[57:53] know I mean although the combat beasts
[57:55] all the things is there in Revelations
[57:57] for one we'll get back to it but there's
[58:00] one sitting on the throne how is it that
[58:08] you and I can think about sitting in his
[58:12] strong to him that overcometh remember
[58:18] what the prophets said he said it's not
[58:20] what we overcome it's how we overcome
[58:23] right it's not what we overcome it's how
[58:27] we overcome and we can only overcome by
[58:30] being in Jesus Christ right by the new
[58:33] birth is the only way we can be an
[58:35] overcomer without the new birth you're
[58:37] not an overcomer I don't care what it is
[58:38] how old you are how young you are
[58:40] without the new birth
[58:41] you're not in sitting in the throne
[58:48] you might try to manufacture something
[58:51] to try to get sitting on something but
[58:52] it won't work I just went through that
[58:54] there's only one there there never will
[58:56] be but wonder when the sonship
[59:00] terminates there never will be but one
[59:01] dark and that doesn't terminate like you
[59:05] think I'm saying it but it's way the
[59:06] prophet in the Bible says it so that's
[59:08] enough for me alright that'll come later
[59:11] but listen to see
[59:14] in his strong is in his domain which is
[59:19] the baptism of the holy ghost
[59:21] rah come on he we've been through all
[59:28] the years of the message in trying to
[59:30] comprehend this had any other surely
[59:32] it's easy to understand if you're
[59:34] sitting in his throne that you're in his
[59:36] kingdom and his kingdom is the baptism
[59:40] of the Holy Ghost the new birth in your
[59:43] soul now that's how it comes up two
[59:46] bases to where we can say then he can
[59:49] say will sit with me in my throne even
[59:54] as I overcame and sit with the father
[59:57] and get strong not gonna spend a lot of
[1:00:01] time thought it goes too much into the
[1:00:03] message to take it but just remember the
[1:00:09] Father's throne is the baptism of the
[1:00:11] Holy Ghost the new birth so you'll sit
[1:00:16] with me in my throne as I overcame and
[1:00:21] sit with my father in his throne now how
[1:00:25] did he overcome he came to earth lived
[1:00:29] on the earth he didn't have to receive
[1:00:30] the new birth to make him - that he
[1:00:32] already had he turn life it's situations
[1:00:35] of explaining our places all right so
[1:00:39] how do we get it in that thrown by the
[1:00:42] new birth that's simple the Newburg puts
[1:00:47] us in the body of Christ puts it here at
[1:00:49] faith in the body of Christ then the
[1:00:51] growth development brings on all the
[1:00:52] other put ever born-again believers in
[1:00:55] the body of Christ that's why ever
[1:00:56] born-again believer then get these
[1:00:59] things it's not that he chooses one age
[1:01:05] because of this or another age because
[1:01:07] I've explained that it's the overcomer
[1:01:09] part is because of the situation of life
[1:01:12] of that age yet but it is not given the
[1:01:15] new birth to one and not giving it to
[1:01:17] the other you know heard great men say
[1:01:23] you know well Luther didn't have the new
[1:01:25] birth Wesley didn't have it Pentecost
[1:01:26] didn't have it
[1:01:27] now to me that's his line as much as
[1:01:29] anything could be lying about because
[1:01:32] your profit covers a whole message in
[1:01:34] the church age will call the Holy Ghost
[1:01:36] in every age you say well now we didn't
[1:01:39] have this we didn't have that come on
[1:01:41] get down let's study the message are you
[1:01:45] gonna say the new birth is not the new
[1:01:47] birth are you gonna say he was wrong
[1:01:49] when he said the Holy Ghost in each age
[1:01:51] is that new birth just because you have
[1:01:55] a preconceived idea of something well we
[1:01:58] don't have what this has why not our
[1:02:01] quote would brother branham I'll show
[1:02:04] you where he put it in I beg you to show
[1:02:07] me where he took it out to East Church
[1:02:12] age would get the new birth in the body
[1:02:15] of Christ they would be a born-again
[1:02:20] believer in each age to receive the word
[1:02:24] of that age and make it live yes but we
[1:02:28] just don't have it like you see you tell
[1:02:30] me go even the prophets message where
[1:02:33] brother Brennan said the baptism of the
[1:02:35] Holy Ghost is was here back in the 50s
[1:02:38] he said just exactly like it was in the
[1:02:40] book of Acts now argue with those things
[1:02:43] you know you can't argue with it you're
[1:02:46] just squatting up and don't say anything
[1:02:50] see but tell me where it's at I'll show
[1:02:53] you where he put it in you show me where
[1:02:55] he took it out I'll show you where he
[1:02:58] said this in each age you showed me
[1:02:59] where he said it's not in each age so he
[1:03:04] says-- inherits the same thing
[1:03:09] now come on I thought you believed the
[1:03:11] scriptures I thought we was kind of over
[1:03:14] in Romans about eight what is it 14 15
[1:03:18] 16 so 14 15 where he's talking about
[1:03:21] that we are heirs and joint heirs with
[1:03:26] Jesus Christ oh now how did we wind up
[1:03:32] being joint our heirs by the new birth
[1:03:36] right the new birth gives our soul
[1:03:40] eternal life
[1:03:41] just as eternal what it is his love is
[1:03:44] nothing to say
[1:03:45] just as eternal is here it is his life
[1:03:49] the new birth is the birth of the word
[1:03:51] for every age and every time so it puts
[1:03:54] all of us into the same position but
[1:03:58] this age this is the age that it comes
[1:04:03] to that that will sit with me and my
[1:04:07] throne
[1:04:08] why did he place it in the seven
[1:04:11] churches why did he not put that in the
[1:04:13] first because they'd be no way to go to
[1:04:19] revelations for revelations for you find
[1:04:26] that throne revelation for you find that
[1:04:29] Kingdom you find that one sitting on the
[1:04:33] throne relations for okay because that's
[1:04:45] the one who goes and takes the book the
[1:04:48] new birth and all of the things alright
[1:04:51] not what we overcome but how we overcome
[1:04:56] the proceeding age okay we'll get
[1:05:02] everything so this age we'll have it all
[1:05:08] lumped up into our hands we get the Tree
[1:05:11] of Life we get all of the things that we
[1:05:13] read in this age what a wonderful age to
[1:05:18] live in we inherit all things no brother
[1:05:26] dad we just in hurt we just didn't hurt
[1:05:32] this we just got something for that age
[1:05:34] with okay go ahead and pull up number
[1:05:37] three let's read the Bible go ahead
[1:05:43] brothers pull up number three
[1:05:50] he that said upon the throne said behold
[1:05:52] I make all things new and he said unto
[1:05:57] me write for these words are true and
[1:05:58] faithful he said unto me it is done I am
[1:06:02] Alpha and Omega the beginning and the
[1:06:04] end I will give unto him that is athirst
[1:06:07] of the fountain of life freely
[1:06:11] he that overcometh shall inherit all
[1:06:16] things and I will be his God and he
[1:06:22] shall be my son that's not just a 7th
[1:06:25] church age that's ever born-again
[1:06:27] believer ever born-again believer in her
[1:06:31] it's eternal life to be heirs and join
[1:06:36] heirs with Jesus Christ heirs of the
[1:06:40] Father because we received that eternal
[1:06:43] life joint heirs with Jesus Christ that
[1:06:45] puts us sitting with him in his throne
[1:06:50] now his thrones not to baptism with all
[1:06:53] those wait a minute now you're getting
[1:07:02] out of it well what is his throne
[1:07:06] because he emphasized to this church age
[1:07:12] if you'll sit with me in my throne as I
[1:07:15] overcome and sit with my father in his
[1:07:17] throne how did he become one with a one
[1:07:20] on the throne they know two people
[1:07:25] sitting up there now get that out of
[1:07:29] your mind
[1:07:29] it ain't Jesus and the father sitting
[1:07:32] there right
[1:07:38] what is his throne the Father's throne
[1:07:43] is the baptism of the Holy Ghost every
[1:07:46] church age has that what is his throne
[1:07:50] that we're gonna have the right to sit
[1:07:52] with him in his strong now remember not
[1:07:57] on but in his throne this age has the
[1:08:03] greatest opportunity sure because we let
[1:08:08] stand in a position of a wonderful thing
[1:08:11] because remember they without us
[1:08:14] cannot be made perfect day without us
[1:08:24] cannot be brought forth into the
[1:08:27] position they're supposed to be so it's
[1:08:30] gonna take us to do the pulling and what
[1:08:34] is our pulling we go through the statue
[1:08:38] of a perfect man we received the new
[1:08:41] birth and then we start the process of
[1:08:44] adoption adoption to bring us to the
[1:08:51] position that sure Luther Wesleyan never
[1:08:55] came into the adoption all stages that
[1:08:59] was reserved for this age but don't
[1:09:06] misunderstand now Martin Luther named
[1:09:09] everybody in this pyramid received the
[1:09:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost no matter what
[1:09:14] age it was the new birth of that age you
[1:09:24] see you're gonna listen to what brother
[1:09:25] so-and-so said he's to understood right
[1:09:31] here and declared it and I done told him
[1:09:34] twice that wasn't right I told him
[1:09:38] before he come to this building he
[1:09:40] wouldn't write he come right here and
[1:09:42] said it I said it again
[1:09:44] he said Luther and Wesleyan him and a
[1:09:47] juicer Street didn't have a baptism in
[1:09:49] the Holy Ghost
[1:09:51] I said brother we'll take bread around
[1:09:53] us a message and we'll just let hit
[1:09:56] answer you where the Prophet said I met
[1:10:00] people with the Holy Ghost what 50 years
[1:10:02] before he said exactly like the day of
[1:10:04] Pentecost well I don't understand that
[1:10:07] I ain't got nothing do with it does that
[1:10:10] make it not right because you don't
[1:10:12] understand it
[1:10:16] I'd listen if I was you I'd go back and
[1:10:20] listen I'd read it over because their
[1:10:26] simple illustration on the day of
[1:10:29] Pentecost 120 received the Holy Spirit
[1:10:38] outside there was three thousand her
[1:10:40] 42:5 three or five they received the
[1:10:44] baptism in the Holy Ghost that only got
[1:10:47] it at faith because they had no tutoring
[1:10:50] of the word so what happened on the
[1:10:54] Zeus's tree Azusa Street had the
[1:10:57] original genuine baptism of the Holy
[1:10:59] Ghost that 2/3 of the to 3,000 outside
[1:11:02] God but around was exactly right yeah we
[1:11:07] think that we've got this figured out
[1:11:09] and I figured out come on let's talk
[1:11:11] about it why cause my soul is involved
[1:11:15] in this time it's not just the fact that
[1:11:17] I try to preach if my soul is involved
[1:11:24] but you see Jesus is thrown he had to
[1:11:33] come through and give the life that was
[1:11:34] in him and that made a way that the
[1:11:37] father's thrown the baptism of the Holy
[1:11:38] Ghost could come on their pinnacle the
[1:11:41] new birth all right and in the
[1:11:45] inheritances and the things down through
[1:11:46] the church ages would be dealing with
[1:11:48] the father strong spirit I'm quoting
[1:11:51] brother Branham but see that's not
[1:11:55] that's not Jesus is strong you said wait
[1:11:58] a minute you you you you you tell that
[1:12:00] to God no I'm not I'm not to God I'm
[1:12:02] talking about the God that's going to in
[1:12:04] more
[1:12:04] in this last days change his form in
[1:12:09] this last days to exist on the earth
[1:12:18] because remember now the next form that
[1:12:27] he goes to is the Millennium which is
[1:12:32] son of David you need to quote that is
[1:12:40] the promise that Jesus will sit on the
[1:12:43] throne as the son of David in the
[1:12:46] millennial reign the son of David the
[1:12:51] son of David is God in human flesh son
[1:12:59] of god was God in spirit phone so then
[1:13:07] for just a moment before it comes into
[1:13:09] that position out to be in the son of
[1:13:14] David to fulfill exactly he comes back
[1:13:17] as son of man all right as decent a van
[1:13:27] let me stay each other way to where
[1:13:29] you'll follow it because brother branham
[1:13:31] was ice on a man but a random was not
[1:13:33] the son of man all right well that's
[1:13:37] where we stand blunt and flying is we
[1:13:39] can be on that because you can't make
[1:13:41] him them but the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:13:43] is these will be the son of man the Word
[1:13:48] made flesh there is your age and what
[1:13:52] God is waiting for you and I to come to
[1:13:55] a place so is everybody else waiting for
[1:13:57] you and I to receive the word what is
[1:14:00] the son of man onto a page 12 I believe
[1:14:05] it's right either surprising the son but
[1:14:06] there's no problem what it is there
[1:14:09] something he said in the beginning was
[1:14:10] the word word was with god and the word
[1:14:12] was god
[1:14:16] he he goes from his throne goes for the
[1:14:21] Father's throne the new birth all right
[1:14:25] and then we get to sit with him in here
[1:14:29] strong why cause we sit with him in the
[1:14:32] father's from we got dire to the
[1:14:35] position by coming in the father strong
[1:14:37] the baptism when the Holy Ghost
[1:14:39] the new birth all right see somebody's
[1:14:44] gonna realize what's taking place all
[1:14:48] right not bragging been serious to think
[1:14:55] an old Trinitarian Baptist would come
[1:15:01] into this message and pick up this
[1:15:04] message and walk forth in it I preached
[1:15:09] my first sermon in nineteen in 69 also
[1:15:15] receive the baptism and Holy Ghost that
[1:15:16] year and that was two years and a
[1:15:19] message for I received it so I didn't do
[1:15:21] like most of you say that you're in the
[1:15:23] message so you know you've got the
[1:15:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost I never
[1:15:26] claimed that I waited until I had
[1:15:30] something certain I preached my first
[1:15:33] sermon and it was what the pride of
[1:15:35] Jesus Christ would be the son of man and
[1:15:40] I read from brother Brandon back then
[1:15:41] all I could read we got a whole lot more
[1:15:43] to read now you say what are you trying
[1:15:47] to make us the Word made flesh what is
[1:15:51] to end this thing up the Word made flesh
[1:15:53] who's the ended up the Word made flesh
[1:15:55] who's the word made faith the bride of
[1:15:57] Jesus Christ the body of Jesus Christ is
[1:15:59] the Word made flesh God he was the Word
[1:16:02] made flesh John 14 what did I want to
[1:16:06] get down at 14 or what and then the word
[1:16:08] was made flesh and dwelt among us who
[1:16:11] was he he was the word who are we the
[1:16:15] word the probably said you become the
[1:16:18] word as you received the word
[1:16:25] let's say you're not gonna get it
[1:16:27] reading verse Almanac you say well how
[1:16:38] are we gonna get it you're gonna get it
[1:16:39] by hearing the word has to become any
[1:16:46] you and me these hours he is thrown
[1:16:50] that's the real throne he always wanted
[1:16:52] because that's his throne where his
[1:16:53] brothers are at right going the Romans
[1:16:58] they were join tires come on until you
[1:17:06] hit the millennium you have to stay in
[1:17:14] connection to get to the millennium
[1:17:17] because the millennium is God in human
[1:17:19] flesh the son of David his rightful
[1:17:23] throne son of David to do that you'll
[1:17:33] read it's not the mighty God I'm Way
[1:17:40] over I'll get it in a minute but anyhow
[1:17:42] we must become the word that's our job
[1:17:52] that's our position there's not a job as
[1:17:54] a position or a thought it would brother
[1:17:58] Dale how are we gonna I didn't make the
[1:18:01] books I didn't write it
[1:18:03] I'm sorry that I was able to read
[1:18:06] because by being able to read I've
[1:18:08] offended people I've become the enemy to
[1:18:11] people because I can read well I'm sorry
[1:18:15] for that but not sorry for the word this
[1:18:22] message is to be made alive by somebody
[1:18:27] and there is that throne that Jesus
[1:18:31] Christ had wrought to and gave up his
[1:18:36] right to then at that time he gave up
[1:18:40] that seat of that throne at that time
[1:18:42] now listen to what I'm saying he died he
[1:18:46] went to the grave he went for he gave up
[1:18:49] the right to walk right into that tree
[1:18:53] of life he gave it up and went to death
[1:19:02] but he walked out of there
[1:19:04] and defeated death we're gonna have to
[1:19:08] walk out of death we're gonna out and
[1:19:11] look at it face to face and just say
[1:19:13] forget it well are you afraid of die I
[1:19:19] can't die I can't die I died a long time
[1:19:26] ago that's not the point if you're
[1:19:29] afraid of dying
[1:19:30] then there's something wrong with your
[1:19:31] experience now humanly come on we gonna
[1:19:33] put a gun there ahead and go glory
[1:19:35] brains out and run in front of a train
[1:19:37] to prove something we're human beings
[1:19:42] that have problems about death when I
[1:19:45] look at somebody my sister burn the
[1:19:47] other day I ask the question always ask
[1:19:49] it from job every funeral I do I ask
[1:19:54] that question job said I know my
[1:19:57] redeemer liveth I asked that question
[1:19:59] because death has a sting to it until
