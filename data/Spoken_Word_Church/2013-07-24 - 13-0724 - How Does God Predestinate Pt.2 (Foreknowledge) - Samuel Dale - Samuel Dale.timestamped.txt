[0:01] shining in the light of your
[0:03] voice
[0:33] amen and amen and amen I want to see him
[0:35] don't you
[0:37] and it's fast getting to a close
[0:40] to be able to come to a time to see him
[0:42] because there's one thing about it every
[0:44] day is 24 hours closer so
[0:48] you know he's made his promises and we
[0:50] believe it don't we it's good to see
[0:52] everybody in the house of the Lord but
[0:54] to have a June's dad back there with his
[0:56] Gene and just
[0:58] for him to come and be with us and uh
[1:01] we're glad to have Brother Ray and
[1:02] sister Kathy back with us on Wednesday
[1:05] she's having to work on Wednesday for a
[1:08] while but things has changed so now
[1:10] they're get to be with us on Wednesday
[1:12] because we miss you when you're not here
[1:18] if you'd like turning your scriptures
[1:19] turn where we've been reading in Romans
[1:22] and then we will go to Romans 8. and
[1:27] then we'll go to Malachi 4.
[1:30] in Malachi Malachi 1 excuse me verse one
[1:34] and three
[1:35] and uh just remember the announcements
[1:37] as I reckon all of the announcements is
[1:40] over we're all except scheduling not
[1:43] this coming Wednesday but what is it the
[1:46] 30th
[1:47] which would be next Wednesday brother
[1:49] four needs to be with us and then a
[1:51] weekend or so later brother Quinn from
[1:53] Ireland is to be with us and then
[1:55] brother Danny Del munde from the
[1:58] Philippines will be with us so we've got
[2:00] to just schedule ahead when it comes
[2:02] around about last of July and the first
[2:04] of August and through there I just I'm
[2:06] just a scheduler so that's it works out
[2:09] pretty good letting all these brothers
[2:11] preach and I get to rest a while but we
[2:13] pray the Lord we're bless amen
[2:17] Romans 8
[2:19] and Malachi 1.
[2:21] do you have any father we thank you
[2:23] tonight for an opportunity to be able to
[2:25] come together and thank you for your
[2:26] love and your grace unto us
[2:28] thank you for Calvary because without
[2:30] that Lord it wouldn't be any need of us
[2:32] being here but we pray that you'd just
[2:34] bless us and father give us
[2:36] understanding of you and reach down and
[2:39] touch us with your love and grace this
[2:41] night
[2:42] you said you'd be with us and you
[2:43] promised it in your word you said you'd
[2:45] you would heal the sick and deliver from
[2:48] destruction when your word went forth
[2:50] and we try our best to preach is what we
[2:52] can of the word so we believe you will
[2:55] be with us tonight and honor that word
[2:57] and just touch the sick among us and
[2:59] just have your way we love you and we
[3:01] thank you
[3:03] just let your grace be sufficient for
[3:05] all the needs that we have and we truly
[3:08] know that it will be we love you and we
[3:10] thank you in Jesus name amen
[3:14] Romans
[3:16] eight
[3:20] let's start with verse 28.
[3:23] and we know that all things work
[3:24] together for good to them that love God
[3:27] to them who are they called according to
[3:29] his purpose
[3:31] for whom he did for no he also did
[3:33] predestinate to be conformed to the
[3:36] image of his son that he might be the
[3:38] firstborn among many brethren
[3:41] moreover whom he did predestinate than
[3:43] he also called and whom he called them
[3:45] he also justified in whom he justified
[3:49] them he also glorified
[3:51] what shall we then say to these things
[3:53] question right if God be for us
[3:57] who can be against us amen
[4:00] let's go over to Malachi and then read
[4:02] and then we're picking up her to talk
[4:05] tonight on this
[4:06] says the burden of the word of the Lord
[4:09] to I to Israel from Malachi I have loved
[4:13] you saith the Lord
[4:15] yet you say we're in had
[4:18] thou loved us
[4:20] now look at look at the point
[4:23] what would choosing of Jacob Esau Etc
[4:27] have to do with thinking about
[4:30] that you know you question God whether
[4:32] he loves you or not
[4:35] right so you might say well Lord I don't
[4:38] know where you love me or not
[4:40] you see because you say I have loved you
[4:44] saith the Lord
[4:46] if you say we're in house thou loved us
[4:50] was not Esau Jacob's brother saith the
[4:52] Lord
[4:53] yet I love Jacob and I hated Esau and
[4:56] laid his mountains in his Heritage ways
[4:58] for the dragons of the Wilderness you
[5:02] may be seated the Lord had his Blessing
[5:04] to the reading of the word
[5:06] now
[5:08] more or less I've done a good bit of
[5:10] preaching there Sunday
[5:12] afternoon and I'll be doing a good bit
[5:14] of reading tonight
[5:15] but I want to get a point into our minds
[5:20] because I'm heading toward a thought
[5:23] that we will be dealing with for some
[5:25] time
[5:26] and I I just pray that you'll bear with
[5:29] me until I get over far enough to start
[5:32] you know considering the things but I
[5:36] want these things out of the way
[5:38] there are things you know that to me
[5:40] that are in the Bible that you know are
[5:43] a foundation
[5:45] and the Lord laying it down showing us
[5:49] and just like I was saying Darcy we
[5:51] would even question and say well now
[5:54] Lord
[5:56] how do we know you loved us
[5:59] you know
[6:00] he says well I called Jacob
[6:04] and I hated Esau
[6:06] he said well what's that got to do with
[6:08] loving
[6:09] well
[6:13] Jacob loved
[6:15] God
[6:17] he said what Esau did too yes but his
[6:20] was not in the correct manifestation
[6:23] so it wound up being in a different
[6:25] point so just think about that now we'll
[6:28] get back to it in a minute in the
[6:29] thought and carry it on
[6:32] but
[6:34] I asked a question and I'll be on this
[6:36] for a while using this as a title how
[6:39] does God predestinate
[6:43] all right now that's been a battle and
[6:45] an argument among organized religions
[6:48] you have what you call the calvinist and
[6:50] then you have the Armenians and they
[6:53] argue backwards and forth about this
[6:56] point of predestination one of them will
[7:00] say yes I believe it this way the others
[7:02] say well I don't believe that but I
[7:03] believe this
[7:04] all right but now
[7:07] what was the thought that we got down to
[7:10] on Sunday there how does God
[7:14] predestinate
[7:16] now if he predetermines something to
[7:19] take place
[7:20] you know like a person lost or something
[7:22] then that would make him a respecter of
[7:25] persons you know
[7:28] that wouldn't be a just God so we
[7:30] believe in a a just God who will you
[7:33] know he he will keep his word
[7:37] all right so then we talk about
[7:41] how will God predestinate how would he
[7:43] do it
[7:46] if he sat down and he picked one
[7:48] and left the other one out for any
[7:51] reason
[7:52] then he'd be a respecter of persons and
[7:56] that would be a very poor God to try to
[7:58] serve because you'd never know which way
[8:00] uh you know you would be in the argument
[8:03] among yourself as to finding out which
[8:06] side you're landing on you know which
[8:09] side is working and you know we don't
[8:12] want to do that which then that way you
[8:14] would try to uh say well if it's this
[8:16] side over here let me find out what that
[8:19] group of people done
[8:21] or are doing you know and I'll try to
[8:24] line up with that
[8:25] and then you say well no it's not that
[8:27] group it's it's this way well let me get
[8:30] in that group you know and find out how
[8:33] they uh how they're doing you know
[8:36] because I want to serve God don't you
[8:39] man I want to please him I want to honor
[8:42] him and I you know and all and and but I
[8:46] I just can't believe that
[8:49] in the words I believe our main point is
[8:51] that we don't see the real truth of
[8:53] predestination is the fact of whether or
[8:56] not we believe God is real
[8:59] and whether or not we believe
[9:01] how really is
[9:04] I'll keep making that emphasis unto us
[9:06] on this part or series as we go along
[9:11] how do you feel about God
[9:16] if God can't keep his word while serving
[9:19] you know
[9:20] I'm serious I'm not uh you know
[9:24] I'm 73 years old there's no need of
[9:26] trying to play games now
[9:28] you know
[9:29] but if God is not real then
[9:32] there's no need of coming to church and
[9:34] doing which is we're wasting our time
[9:37] you know we could eat drink and be merry
[9:39] cause them are we all died we just fell
[9:42] off with some glorified uh Monkey Tree
[9:45] as they call them Evolution and you know
[9:49] I don't believe it that way I believe
[9:51] that God is real
[9:54] and I don't believe that he sat down
[9:57] before the world and picked that one
[10:00] person and rejected the other one
[10:04] because I said you would be wanting to
[10:06] find out instead of trying to find God
[10:09] to save you
[10:11] do you understand what I'm getting at by
[10:13] my illustration that we all should want
[10:16] to know how to come to God for salvation
[10:19] right right
[10:20] and if it's this side over here you know
[10:24] if it's the Armenian doctrine of keeping
[10:27] on all of the ordinances and dates times
[10:31] and Seasons or whatever
[10:33] and trying to be legalistic about it
[10:36] then you know we want to do that
[10:40] because I want to be saved don't you
[10:43] all right well if it's the calvinist so
[10:46] I did just well it just don't make no
[10:48] difference I'm saved anyway
[10:50] well I want to put my whole heart and
[10:53] desire into that point
[10:56] of where I believe the Salvation is
[10:58] linked to
[11:01] and I believe I believe our Salvation is
[11:03] linked to the word that's right
[11:06] because how else could we hear or
[11:08] whatever we have need of you know
[11:11] which I believe we need to go into the
[11:13] word and study the word and from the
[11:16] study of the word then it will bring us
[11:19] the uh
[11:20] the understanding
[11:23] right oh salvation of what we're doing
[11:25] and and all like that
[11:28] so that's what I believe in it that we
[11:30] got down to the point of of reading
[11:32] where brother Branham was given the the
[11:34] thoughts on
[11:36] for knowledge and predestination
[11:43] but I want to make sure that we follow
[11:45] that in the right order
[11:48] all right we read it our Sunday and we
[11:50] tried to illustrate a little in our
[11:53] thoughts
[11:54] we'll read it again in a moment
[11:56] where the prophet of God says
[11:59] predestination looks back
[12:02] to foreknowledge amen
[12:07] he said for knowledge
[12:10] looks to Destiny
[12:12] well
[12:13] so that would mean then
[12:15] as I was trying to illustrate Sunday
[12:18] that the most important thing is the
[12:20] foreknowledge of God
[12:23] we've always been concerned about what
[12:25] was predetermined you know
[12:29] and if it was predetermined we'd we
[12:31] would fight and argue about whether we
[12:33] had a choice
[12:34] of you know
[12:37] or we're just predetermined is going to
[12:39] be what I'm going to be
[12:41] but when you start dealing with
[12:43] foreknowledge
[12:46] I know and realize that in dealing with
[12:49] foreknowledge
[12:50] that we're going to develop a thought in
[12:53] our mind
[12:55] that
[12:57] um
[12:58] well it's based upon what I do
[13:05] for knowledge
[13:09] and that's true but now we'll get down
[13:11] to it one of these days
[13:12] we're
[13:14] you know
[13:17] God already he sent word down to a man
[13:19] one time and didn't make his house in
[13:21] order Hezekiah you know he said you're
[13:24] going to die
[13:25] right
[13:27] that's right well he turned his head to
[13:29] the wall and began to pray and he begged
[13:31] God and
[13:32] God sent that same Prophet back
[13:36] that Prophet went down and told him thus
[13:38] saith the Lord
[13:40] you're going to die
[13:43] God sent the same Prophet back
[13:47] and said thus saith the Lord you're not
[13:49] going to die
[13:51] he said I'm going to give you 15 years
[13:54] well he did well we know the story
[13:57] it would have been better for Hezekiah
[13:59] to really die
[14:01] because he put Israel into a
[14:04] deep deep hole of sin with that 15 years
[14:09] but it's still the point is God
[14:12] for some reason
[14:17] he changed his mind
[14:20] he said well God don't change his mind
[14:25] well something happened
[14:28] because he told him he's going to die
[14:32] and then he told him he's going to live
[14:35] now see that way we think we understand
[14:38] foreknowledge
[14:39] foreign
[14:43] we'll get to that
[14:45] as a point as we try to go along
[14:47] but just remember
[14:51] God don't change his mind about his word
[14:55] all he done to Hezekiah was extended his
[14:58] life
[15:01] he died
[15:04] he died 15 years later
[15:07] so he didn't have to change his mind
[15:09] like we think
[15:13] but he did change his mind
[15:18] you know that
[15:22] life consists of a lot of things that we
[15:24] need to maybe sometimes change our minds
[15:27] about
[15:29] and praying
[15:31] you know
[15:32] pray for your kids
[15:36] pray for your wife your husband Etc
[15:38] that's not serving the lord
[15:43] you know it might be that God might
[15:46] change his mind
[15:48] right he said well you you sound like
[15:50] one time you're talking about an
[15:52] infinite God that can't never make
[15:54] another decision and then you'd look
[15:55] like he turned around said well look
[15:57] like he just changed his mind you know
[16:00] that's what I'm saying do we understand
[16:06] by God's foreknowledge
[16:09] he knew what he was going to do
[16:12] when he sent the prophet to Hezekiah
[16:17] he knew or else he's not God
[16:22] he knew he was going to extend his life
[16:27] well did he change his mind as much as
[16:29] we think
[16:35] if Hezekiah went into the bad things
[16:37] that
[16:38] we're going to have to deal with a
[16:40] little something and we'll get back to
[16:42] it Sunday but I'm just laying this down
[16:43] then we'll back up
[16:47] what do you think about permissive will
[16:51] and perfect will
[16:59] permissive will is not perfect will
[17:01] right
[17:03] no because it won't work
[17:05] but yet God can take permissive will
[17:10] and make it work out
[17:12] for his perfect will
[17:18] so really do we understand
[17:22] I say this because
[17:24] you know the reason I I lay things out
[17:26] like that sometimes and just lay it out
[17:28] a little bit and then back away
[17:30] is because that we get Soul set in our
[17:34] mind that we we say I know what that is
[17:37] it's just for knowledge
[17:41] you know it's just God's foreknowledge
[17:44] well it's not just God's foreknowledge
[17:53] sure he knows what he's going to do
[17:56] but how can he judge us
[18:00] if he makes us do it
[18:03] amen
[18:05] you can't my brother says he can't judge
[18:08] me for being a sinner because he made me
[18:10] a sinner
[18:12] I said no he didn't make us sinner
[18:15] I said he made you on a free moral
[18:17] agency just like anyone else
[18:19] and you accepted the fact of of being a
[18:22] sinner
[18:23] he made you with a choice
[18:26] so you don't blame God for it
[18:29] but that I say those things and you see
[18:32] I know that sometimes I watch and
[18:34] sometimes you reactions and I don't need
[18:36] the reactions a lot of times to know
[18:38] thoughts of human beings but I'm trying
[18:40] to get us to not just lock down on one
[18:44] thing
[18:46] because when we do we're just like
[18:51] the Armenians are the the calvinist
[18:56] we take our thoughts and ideas and we
[18:58] put a period
[19:02] you know
[19:03] we say it can't be any other way
[19:12] is that right
[19:15] he said what
[19:17] you know I know
[19:20] righteous together make you think
[19:24] you go home and think about what I'm
[19:25] saying
[19:29] because if you're not careful
[19:31] you'll get on the four knowledge points
[19:34] so much
[19:36] until you'll just run your router for
[19:39] knowledge
[19:41] and you'll say well God thought I was
[19:44] going to be sick so I'm sick
[19:51] right
[19:54] and then we'll run on that route with it
[19:56] well maybe he wants me to stay sick
[19:59] right
[20:09] see sometimes he wants us change our
[20:12] minds amen amen more than changing his
[20:17] that's what I'm saying see we could just
[20:19] we just get on a point and we just well
[20:21] that's it
[20:24] when you get into God and dealing with
[20:27] his ways and doings
[20:29] you know
[20:33] we don't want to drive down a stake
[20:35] somewhere and just try to stop on
[20:37] something
[20:40] remember that's organized religion
[20:44] they say we believe this
[20:47] made you stop
[20:50] you and I can do the same thing
[20:54] so don't don't just think about four
[20:57] knowledge is you know it's
[21:00] totally what God for knew and that's
[21:02] true he did
[21:04] that's where the truth is so hard to
[21:06] preach
[21:09] he said hard to preach the truth yeah
[21:12] because the way man's mind has been
[21:13] taught
[21:15] he said would I've never been taught
[21:17] nothing about predestination
[21:21] you sit and listen to Mom and Daddy talk
[21:23] sometime in the floor and that held with
[21:25] you
[21:28] well I guess that was predetermined to
[21:31] happen so it's got to happen
[21:34] well let me give you a scripture
[21:37] let's see if we can deal with
[21:39] foreknowledge and and deal with what I'm
[21:41] trying to say by scripture
[21:43] the Bible says it's appointed unto man
[21:45] wants to die
[21:49] is that Bible
[21:53] well we're all gonna die
[21:58] is that the way we think about it
[22:03] if it is we're all gonna die
[22:07] so see you can drive your your point of
[22:10] foreknowledge to to where it just I've
[22:13] been thinking on this all day today and
[22:15] I thought in my mind and I wrote a few
[22:17] notes down but
[22:19] I see we can just deal with with the
[22:21] four knowledge point until we can
[22:24] we run to the ground
[22:28] because it's appointed and the man wants
[22:30] to die
[22:32] you know somebody has got to come to a
[22:35] place
[22:37] right that they can search the
[22:39] scriptures enough to find something in
[22:42] the scriptures
[22:43] that will not destroy that scripture
[22:49] but we'll magnify it or you know Jesus
[22:54] never come to destroy the law under the
[22:55] scriptures or anything he came to
[22:57] magnify the law
[22:58] he said you said of old Thou shalt not
[23:02] commit adultery he said but I say unto
[23:04] thee if you look on a woman or lust
[23:05] actor in your heart said you committed a
[23:07] daughter already he magnified it
[23:10] all right
[23:12] see then you take the scripture there
[23:14] where it says it's appointed unto man
[23:15] wants to die
[23:17] you know that actually Jesus Christ by
[23:20] his death to take my place he broke that
[23:24] scripture
[23:26] he didn't annihilate it because people
[23:28] are still dying
[23:33] but he took my place
[23:39] see then that scripture can't apply to
[23:41] me right
[23:43] right somebody's gonna have to say that
[23:45] one of these days
[23:46] because the Bible says you're Chained
[23:48] and won't drink with an eye
[23:50] see we look at it as everybody's going
[23:52] to die
[23:54] no
[23:56] everybody's not going to die
[23:58] Enoch didn't die
[24:01] Elijah didn't die
[24:05] right
[24:08] well see my point that I'm trying to get
[24:10] you we when I lay hat I will and I'll
[24:13] lay heavily on for knowledge
[24:16] but just don't run your foreknowledge so
[24:18] far back until you can't keep a level
[24:21] ahead in the rest of the scripture
[24:24] because when you do you're gonna you'll
[24:26] be out on the on the end of the limb you
[24:28] know
[24:30] so think about it
[24:33] for knowledge
[24:36] is a wonderful thing
[24:41] it is actually a knowledge Webster says
[24:46] of something before
[24:50] that's why it's called for knowledge
[24:53] all right
[24:55] the Bible says those who he foreknew
[24:59] he did predestinate
[25:02] all right
[25:05] then
[25:07] coming down to where we're at and
[25:09] looking at
[25:11] it he's taking what he said to us that
[25:14] predestination
[25:17] it looks back
[25:20] to foreknowledge
[25:24] all right
[25:26] but then when you come back to
[25:28] foreknowledge
[25:31] you can see the destiny
[25:35] it laid out in front of you
[25:41] and see to me now
[25:45] this is this is my thought so just
[25:47] forgive me this to bring your thoughts
[25:49] Connor I don't want to just preach free
[25:51] destination for not only just read a
[25:52] bunch of quotes right
[25:55] for me to think about
[25:59] for knowledge
[26:02] as being that God foreknew
[26:08] all things
[26:12] then he could according to Revelation 13
[26:15] 8 he could write all the names in the
[26:16] land Book of Life for the foundation
[26:18] world
[26:20] and it could be that's the scripture
[26:21] says that Jesus Christ stood as a lamb
[26:23] slain before the foundation of the world
[26:30] but that took place two thousand years
[26:32] ago
[26:34] this Christ being crucified
[26:38] you see then foreknowledge
[26:43] it means that God in his mind
[26:48] before the world ever begun before there
[26:50] was anything
[26:51] a world or anything
[26:56] we know that the Bible calls him or the
[26:58] words used in it speaks of Elohim
[27:02] which means self-existing that's the
[27:04] best words they can use for it
[27:10] existed alone
[27:15] but he wasn't alone he had his thoughts
[27:25] now don't you think that he knew that we
[27:28] would fall if he created us as was
[27:30] bringing out Sunday
[27:33] if he didn't he's not God
[27:36] that's my whole point
[27:40] does God know everything
[27:43] if he doesn't he's not God he's one of
[27:46] the Gods
[27:48] we certainly don't want to go that way
[27:49] do we
[27:55] we're not dealing with just some thought
[27:57] of a
[27:58] of a God you know or some idea
[28:04] then it puts foreknowledge to me as one
[28:07] of the greatest things that could ever
[28:08] be thought of
[28:16] foreknowledge is the greatest thought it
[28:19] could ever be
[28:20] in any way
[28:25] because he knew
[28:27] I would want to be saved
[28:36] he knew that by his foreknowledge
[28:41] no I
[28:43] don't know we preached it I can go all
[28:46] the way back and we will
[28:52] but I want you to think about
[28:53] foreknowledge
[28:58] and you know what that gives you a
[28:59] connection that maybe you'd never
[29:01] thought of
[29:07] because then it's not a stamped thing of
[29:11] predetermining it
[29:19] God would not desire for anybody to be
[29:21] lost
[29:24] he wanted everybody saved
[29:27] right
[29:32] and then to think about it for knowledge
[29:37] that
[29:40] you've got a part of it
[29:47] I wasn't going to go this way tonight
[29:49] but I will for a second then back up and
[29:51] go back on it Sunday
[29:53] you got a part to do with it right
[30:01] he saw your desire
[30:09] he saw what you wanted
[30:12] my brother down I definitely didn't want
[30:14] it I was out there in the world of sin
[30:18] you know but something happened didn't
[30:20] it
[30:22] something changed you didn't
[30:31] we want to try to be some kind of a
[30:33] great big super duper uh
[30:36] seed
[30:42] we want to try to make it something some
[30:45] great big thing that's within us
[30:51] when the prophet of God said every
[30:53] person in the world
[30:55] was born because of a Creator creating
[31:00] us
[31:02] whether it be hot and taught that's
[31:05] never heard of Jesus Christ
[31:07] Yeti worships alligators he worships his
[31:10] son he worship animals he worship why
[31:13] why does he do that
[31:18] because he's a creation
[31:21] and he knows as a creator
[31:26] and he longs to try to find that creator
[31:31] or in some way satisfy him
[31:37] so they'll feed their babies and
[31:38] alligators
[31:40] right to try to
[31:42] get along with their God
[31:48] but I want you to think just get that in
[31:50] your mind and then I'll get off of it
[31:52] foreknowledge is the greatest thing that
[31:54] you could ever think of
[32:01] God doesn't choose by
[32:04] who's good and who's not good
[32:07] if he did he goofed up
[32:13] right
[32:16] Moses
[32:18] what about Paul killing all the
[32:20] Christians
[32:23] putting them to death
[32:26] signing this signature to
[32:29] no telling how many of that they killed
[32:34] and yet God saved him
[32:41] don't you ever think about yourself
[32:46] why did God save you
[32:48] you don't ever think that way
[32:52] you don't ever even consider it do you
[32:54] think it's some great big something some
[32:56] thing you've done or didn't do or
[33:06] you have four knowledge goes all the way
[33:08] back
[33:09] into God's mind
[33:14] any four new all kinds
[33:21] then he could set in motion
[33:23] on the Earth
[33:26] things to make it come to his perfect
[33:28] will
[33:36] it was not God's perfect will to bring
[33:38] you an eye on the earth in the
[33:40] conditioned existence that we are
[33:46] you know what he's going to change these
[33:48] bodies
[33:51] to make his perfect will come into being
[33:57] yet he will take his permission will
[34:02] and bless and honor
[34:05] until he comes to a time that we can be
[34:07] made eternal
[34:11] permissive will
[34:15] if there hadn't been a permissive will
[34:22] I'm giving you some things to think on
[34:26] if there hadn't been a permissive will
[34:27] how would he have ever displayed his
[34:31] attributes
[34:38] what about a permissive will to bring
[34:40] God's attributes into being
[34:45] sounds like a perfect wheel don't it
[34:49] but it's only permissive
[34:54] see we want to make ourselves to be some
[34:56] kind of a great son instead of Simply
[34:59] thinking about your life
[35:04] you don't ever sit down sometimes and
[35:07] just Ponder
[35:08] you know just think about your life
[35:11] you think about what you were doing
[35:17] and then something happened
[35:19] to turn you around
[35:24] something just changed things
[35:28] you can't explain it can you
[35:32] don't need any trying
[35:36] see that's the foreknowledge of God now
[35:38] all right
[35:41] now when we get down into minutes you'll
[35:43] see more of what I'm talking about so
[35:44] let's go ahead and do a little reading
[35:45] because I want to stay on this until we
[35:48] see it
[35:49] amen but look what the prophet of God
[35:51] said look at number four go ahead these
[35:54] are the Sunday Sunday Services notes
[35:57] I just got so far
[35:59] look what he said on the message called
[36:01] the power of God in 1955 1006 the
[36:04] evening sir the word predestinate that's
[36:06] not a good word to use the word
[36:08] foreknowledge is better see because
[36:09] there's so many doctrines of
[36:11] predestination
[36:12] I'll read you one to many where he says
[36:14] there's a Doctrine predestination it's
[36:16] just it's garbage
[36:19] and see most people's ideas yours and
[36:23] mine upon
[36:25] predestination
[36:28] we're garbage cans
[36:31] sorry
[36:33] well we had it right
[36:36] you couldn't explain Hezekiah
[36:41] oh you didn't have it right
[36:45] he was only in permissive
[36:48] but look what he says
[36:50] predestination looks back to
[36:52] foreknowledge
[36:56] and foreknowledge looks to the
[36:57] destination
[36:59] all right so which one's first
[37:03] did God sit down draw out a road map
[37:06] make pictures do whatever
[37:08] this is the way it's going to be
[37:13] that would be predetermining
[37:20] well what about an infinite God that
[37:22] knew what everything was going to be
[37:27] then he doesn't have to predetermine
[37:29] does he
[37:34] now there are things in God that he does
[37:37] we will eventually get to it
[37:40] you realize the fivefold ministry
[37:46] faithful Ministry is a predestinated
[37:49] Eternal gift
[37:50] from God
[37:54] that's what your Prophet says unless if
[37:56] you believe it when we get there
[38:01] what do you understand
[38:06] God not making
[38:09] said it in order a little hole that you
[38:12] have to go through
[38:13] and can't go no other way
[38:25] it can't be
[38:29] it can't be a hole he just puts you in
[38:31] and makes you go through
[38:39] it gives you a choice
[38:45] you had a choice whether to come to
[38:47] church or not or not
[38:50] probably long about now you're wondering
[38:51] what in the world I'm preaching I
[38:52] probably said well I wish I just stayed
[38:54] home
[38:57] hey
[39:02] we want to make it something see like
[39:04] he's saying there we want to make it
[39:06] something that that predestination is
[39:09] just a hole and he puts you in that hole
[39:13] and makes you go
[39:17] then we'll back up and say uh no that's
[39:19] not right he foreknew
[39:27] he forward knew he's going to put you in
[39:28] a hole and push you through it
[39:31] now you're in the same shape
[39:33] are you listening you're in the same
[39:36] shape as in you got put in the hole push
[39:39] through it
[39:46] God don't do his works like that
[39:48] that's why I love him
[39:54] he's working on your
[39:58] desire
[40:06] he'll give you just exactly
[40:08] the amount you desire
[40:15] but you certainly don't believe in
[40:17] predestination
[40:20] for knowledge first
[40:25] and I believe then that he predestinates
[40:28] our sets of Destiny
[40:30] that this world is going to last so long
[40:32] that it's going to do this there was a
[40:34] predestination of this is going to
[40:36] happen uh that's going to happen
[40:43] but he knew it would happen
[40:50] see we don't want to pray because we
[40:52] might be praying against the will of God
[40:58] you'll never come up with that idea have
[41:00] you
[41:04] no Baptist Church way back
[41:07] they had a Doctrine
[41:12] they believed that they didn't want to
[41:14] have no Revival
[41:18] you know why
[41:20] because they afraid you they wouldn't
[41:22] take your kids to their kids to a
[41:24] Revival
[41:25] because they're afraid they might get
[41:27] saved it wouldn't be God's will
[41:37] uh come on
[41:39] may we quote in the message people
[41:45] said one time he said I'd like for me
[41:47] and my wife to have another child
[41:51] but said I'm afraid it might not be a
[41:52] predestinated seed
[42:03] okay what's your thoughts
[42:08] what's your thoughts
[42:11] look
[42:14] but God's not making it said and said it
[42:17] in order a little hole that you have to
[42:19] go through and can't go no other way but
[42:22] God in order to be God he knowed the end
[42:25] from the beginning so he could predict
[42:27] and set things in order to happen
[42:30] true
[42:36] but he's working according to your
[42:38] desires
[42:40] because he desired it everybody to be
[42:42] saved
[42:46] okay
[42:48] what about the next one where I think
[42:50] Pentecost fail 1955-11-11
[42:57] and the word here is used in the fifth
[42:58] verse of predestination
[43:00] predestinated it's not a very good word
[43:02] reason he's saying it's not a good word
[43:04] is because of what I said
[43:05] you know you'll hear it over and over
[43:07] and over and it's not a good word it
[43:09] doesn't mean it's not a right word or
[43:11] right
[43:12] predestination is right it's just that
[43:14] mankind and their ideas when you say
[43:17] predestination he's a presbyterian
[43:21] right
[43:22] because that was the Presbyterian
[43:24] Doctrine all right he's a Baptist that
[43:26] was a Baptist doctor the Baptist Church
[43:28] was split by Two Brothers over
[43:30] predestination
[43:35] see so you said predestin well he's he's
[43:37] Presbyterian
[43:41] you see that it's not a good word to use
[43:46] well because it gives you the wrong
[43:49] thought
[43:51] because your mind is trained of what
[43:54] that word predestination means
[44:00] I hope one of these days to be able to
[44:02] preach enough about it
[44:04] until God's predestination
[44:11] will so Captivate you and I until we'll
[44:14] see his foreknowledge
[44:23] you see that sounds silly sure does
[44:26] that's the way I think
[44:31] I don't want us to get worthy we just X
[44:34] Out predestination
[44:38] says all for knowledge
[44:44] I want us to be able to use these words
[44:49] but yet not be confused
[44:52] do you follow me
[44:57] supercars kind of confuses people when
[44:59] you say free that's tonight
[45:01] predestination speaks looks back to
[45:03] foreknowledge foreknowledge looks to
[45:05] destination
[45:07] predestination goes back to the
[45:09] foreknowledge foreknowledge goes to the
[45:12] destiny it's all right for knowledge is
[45:14] the greatest understanding of all
[45:18] right we've tried to figure out
[45:19] predestination
[45:22] why not try to figure out foreknowledge
[45:33] well it just simply means god look down
[45:35] through
[45:40] well why didn't he just go on vacation
[45:42] until the world got through
[45:44] and leave us alone and let us just do
[45:46] whatever we're going to do
[45:50] when I first heard that Prophet make
[45:51] that statement one day
[45:53] I was shouting about it
[45:56] he said even though God had done what he
[45:59] done and provided a lamb and Etc
[46:01] he said he didn't step in heaven
[46:04] he said he come down here to live
[46:06] through life with you and I
[46:10] that's right if it's all preterm
[46:13] determined set
[46:14] why did he need to come
[46:22] see I want to drive it down until we'll
[46:24] see predestination is a good word
[46:30] because it's in God's word
[46:36] he's explaining for knowledge
[46:39] he's explained it's going to explain
[46:40] predestination goes back to full
[46:42] knowledge
[46:44] before knowledge goes to Destiny
[46:47] see we want to come over here we're to
[46:49] predestinating that
[46:51] oh I could just see that predestinated
[46:53] seat I just believe you know like I said
[46:54] Napoleon stick his hand in he I think I
[46:57] was here before
[47:00] that's what Napoleon thought
[47:02] well I think I'm a seed
[47:05] You Think You Are
[47:08] you don't know what you are
[47:16] look he's explaining it
[47:18] in other words God didn't say now I'll
[47:22] make this man be this and I'll make this
[47:25] man be that
[47:26] he didn't do it
[47:29] but in order to be God he had to know
[47:32] the end from the beginning amen
[47:36] so in order to
[47:39] for knowledge that he knew he could say
[47:42] this would happen and that would happen
[47:45] because he was God
[47:47] and knowed where everything would be
[47:50] placed
[47:52] what and therefore he could ordain
[47:55] certain things
[47:57] for certain ages
[48:03] you believe that
[48:05] that's the scriptures he said
[48:10] certain things for certain ages
[48:12] that's where I ended Sunday
[48:18] now
[48:21] think about these things
[48:24] let's read one more
[48:26] number six
[48:29] Junction of time 1956.
[48:33] 122.
[48:36] did you ever read over in Romans 9 and
[48:38] we're going to get that in just a second
[48:40] how did he said before either boy was
[48:42] born
[48:43] Esau and Jacob said I hate one
[48:48] and love the other
[48:51] how can he be just
[48:54] and do that
[48:57] what he said
[49:02] how can he be just
[49:05] and love Jacob and Haiti saw
[49:14] how did he say it is by foreknowledge he
[49:17] knew what a rascal he saw was
[49:21] seeing he could predestinate not just
[49:24] say say that the word predestinate is
[49:26] not a good word to use it's
[49:28] foreknowledge because he wouldn't just
[49:31] be deliberately turn you away now here's
[49:34] the one we got to Sunday because it's
[49:36] because you have he wants you to go away
[49:38] now the prophet's not saying he wants
[49:40] you to go away
[49:41] pull that part out right
[49:43] because stop your sentence here because
[49:47] it's not that he wants you to go away
[49:48] God don't want you to go away
[49:51] right
[49:53] read it over and over and over to you
[49:54] get the point he's not wanting you to go
[49:56] away
[49:57] he's wanting you to be saved
[50:00] and he wouldn't do it that way
[50:03] he's not willing that any of you should
[50:05] perish but before knowledge he knows
[50:07] what he will do even before you ever
[50:10] come on to Earth sure for knowledge
[50:14] he's infinite he's God he's omnipotent
[50:16] I'm the president omniscient and he
[50:19] knows all things all wisdom and all time
[50:21] covered all his face and all power he's
[50:24] infinite and if he isn't that he's not
[50:27] God if he is an almighty God if he can't
[50:31] do all things he's not almighty God but
[50:33] if he's almighty God he can do all
[50:35] things see so that's the way we have to
[50:38] believe him
[50:40] we got to believe that he didn't make no
[50:42] mistakes
[50:45] right
[50:47] that he can't make a mistake
[50:52] we've got to believe that
[50:55] or else we wind up wondering what he's
[50:58] doing
[51:02] he didn't want nobody to be lost
[51:06] he wants everybody to be saved
[51:13] but no
[51:16] no who will be saved and who won't now
[51:17] you're you put your God in a peanut
[51:20] brain situation like you and I are in
[51:24] see he can't never have a new thought
[51:31] you and I do all the time and he can't
[51:33] do it
[51:34] look what he's saying now he said go to
[51:35] Romans 9. let's pull that up and just
[51:37] read it
[51:38] Romans 9.
[51:42] or 6 through 13.
[51:46] not as though the word of God hath taken
[51:48] none effect
[51:50] but they are not always Israel which are
[51:52] of Israel
[51:53] neither because they are the Seed of
[51:55] Abraham
[51:57] are they all children
[51:59] but in Isaac
[52:01] shall thy seed be called
[52:06] this is they which are the children of
[52:09] the flesh
[52:12] these are not the children of God
[52:16] the children of flesh is not the
[52:18] children of God
[52:20] come on
[52:21] but the children of the promised
[52:25] are counted for the seed
[52:32] yeah I hope you catching them now you
[52:33] ought to see where we're going we're
[52:34] going down eventually you get to talk
[52:36] about that seed
[52:41] listen
[52:42] for This Is The Word of Promise
[52:45] at this time will I come and say Rose
[52:47] shall have a son
[52:50] now that's
[52:52] dealing real good in the line of Sarah
[52:55] and
[52:56] Isaac and Isaac be in the seed of
[52:59] promise and
[53:01] right Paul coming down explaining it now
[53:04] look what he says
[53:08] but not only this but when Rebecca had
[53:11] conceived by one even by Our Father
[53:12] Isaac
[53:14] for the children being not yet born
[53:18] neither haven't done any good or evil
[53:22] that the purpose of God according to
[53:24] election might stand
[53:25] not of works but of him that calleth
[53:28] it was said unto her the Elder Shall
[53:30] Serve the younger
[53:34] as it is written Jacob have I loved but
[53:37] he saw how I hated
[53:44] now what has that to do with the text
[53:47] that Paul is in
[53:52] he's just got to explaining though that
[53:55] are not those that are of the flesh are
[53:58] not
[53:59] the children of the promise
[54:05] that's what he's explaining
[54:07] Jacob and Esau both was lost
[54:13] both of them needed a sacrifice
[54:17] the flesh is not involved
[54:19] right
[54:22] it's a promise
[54:27] see that away Jacob and Esau could have
[54:30] the same mom and daddy
[54:38] and yet God loved Jacob in 80s are
[54:46] it's not a seat of the pr of the law the
[54:49] seat of the prime of that it's the seed
[54:50] of promise
[54:51] we're going to get to that point when
[54:53] you get back to that scripture but
[54:55] you'll see what I'm talking about
[54:58] look at number seven
[55:03] which is uh God's covenant with Abraham
[55:05] in his seat 56-23
[55:09] . now Jesus didn't come to Calvary just
[55:12] for a haphazard thought
[55:14] what
[55:16] well I'll die up there and perhaps maybe
[55:19] somebody
[55:20] will feel sorry for me and come down and
[55:24] get saved
[55:26] he said no no God don't run his office
[55:29] like that you don't run your office like
[55:31] that
[55:33] now if it's a hole that you put in and
[55:36] pushed through
[55:44] that would be your haphazard thought
[55:49] come on
[55:51] Jesus never come to Calvary
[55:54] to make you go any certain way
[55:59] he come at Calvary to die for everyone
[56:08] amen now if you don't believe it that
[56:10] way you're going to predetermined
[56:12] totally
[56:13] so just go on with your Doctrine
[56:18] Jesus never come to save this certain
[56:21] people
[56:22] he comes to save everybody
[56:26] he paid the price for everybody
[56:31] he said well he knew who would be saved
[56:33] and who wouldn't
[56:34] it's all right
[56:38] now you're going back to foreknowledge
[56:45] because you done got off your haphazard
[56:47] dog you've lost it in predestination
[56:53] well God before the world he just saw
[56:55] certain people be saved and he come down
[56:57] to die for that
[56:59] that's no more than what he says there
[57:01] that you think maybe that you come down
[57:03] on the cross and he said and that's my
[57:06] brother he's a Methodist preacher this
[57:08] is what he says about it he said told me
[57:10] one day he said I think everything in
[57:12] the is just kind of haphazard in life
[57:14] but said there are certain things that
[57:16] are predetermined but said I don't think
[57:18] one of them is Jesus died on the cross
[57:20] and I said what do you mean he said well
[57:22] what he done he just come down to die
[57:24] hoping somebody feel sorry for him get
[57:26] saved I didn't know that was what that
[57:28] man come on down later
[57:30] and I know he didn't hear it
[57:34] but he said he he just died for this you
[57:36] know this morning to anybody now there's
[57:38] your
[57:41] Crossing you for knowledge in your
[57:42] predestination
[57:44] he didn't come down to do that
[57:46] he come to seek and save those that was
[57:48] lost which was everybody
[57:51] when you make salvation only for a
[57:53] certain seed
[57:54] or group of people
[57:56] you've done gone into predetermine
[58:00] You've Lost Your foreknowledge
[58:05] but if you leave it to the point of
[58:07] where that he knows what you're going to
[58:09] do
[58:10] before you ever do it that's no problem
[58:16] why would he hate Jacob and love Esau
[58:18] that's no problem let's read
[58:21] he'll run it off it's like that Jesus
[58:24] come
[58:25] for one specific purpose that was to
[58:28] redeem those that God foreknew
[58:31] would be redeemed
[58:34] he said what you just said he come to
[58:36] die for everybody that's right
[58:40] and that's what he's saying
[58:45] come on
[58:46] everybody's got to have the opportunity
[58:48] to be saved
[58:50] but yet by knowing who would be saved
[58:53] and who wouldn't
[58:56] he knows who he come to die for
[59:00] salvation is for everybody
[59:02] but everybody won't have it right
[59:06] so it's not for everybody then right
[59:11] because it won't have it
[59:14] God's not willing that any should perish
[59:16] but it all would come to repentance but
[59:19] in order to be God he had to know
[59:21] now the word predestinate is used in
[59:23] Ephesians 1 5 predestinate there isn't a
[59:26] good word it means
[59:30] in in speaking of three destinations
[59:32] people sometimes lead them to think that
[59:34] God just predestinated you to push you
[59:36] through a little pipe
[59:39] same quote as well ago right
[59:41] or something that's not right
[59:43] predestination looks back to
[59:45] foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks to
[59:47] Destiny therefore God being God before
[59:50] the foundation of the world knew that
[59:53] who would be saved and who would not
[59:56] Romans 8. he could say that he hated
[59:59] which is Romans 9.
[1:00:01] Esau and loved Jacob before either child
[1:00:04] was born four by four knowledge he
[1:00:06] knowed what a little shyster that he saw
[1:00:09] would be
[1:00:12] and how he would save Jacob so therefore
[1:00:15] by foreknowledge God knew those things
[1:00:18] see for knowledge so then
[1:00:21] look now and I'm basing something I wish
[1:00:24] we had more time about his subject he's
[1:00:26] basing it on the facts of foreknowledge
[1:00:28] and God knew and didn't say that there
[1:00:31] will be he said there'd be a church God
[1:00:34] knew there'd be a church
[1:00:36] but let me get just a thought
[1:00:42] see we want to put everything on the
[1:00:45] we used to put everything on the
[1:00:46] predestinate
[1:00:49] huh
[1:00:51] then we learned of the foreknowledge
[1:00:54] of existing before the predestination
[1:01:00] and then now we want to put everything
[1:01:01] under the foreknowledge that's fine
[1:01:04] because before new all things
[1:01:06] hold a Pony for new
[1:01:09] all time
[1:01:11] but now as I said while ago
[1:01:15] he foreknew Hezekiah would want 15 years
[1:01:21] so he gave it to him
[1:01:24] yet he had already told him
[1:01:26] he was going to die
[1:01:29] so it never changed his mind about him
[1:01:31] dying
[1:01:39] but he knew what would happen
[1:01:42] what about your foreknowledge
[1:01:47] see he knew
[1:01:51] Jacob would be a little shyster
[1:01:56] and like I said the other day
[1:01:58] we want to take Jacob and Esau and make
[1:02:00] some form of a salvational point out of
[1:02:02] it but just remember
[1:02:04] that's only type in your salvation
[1:02:08] did you understand that Sunday
[1:02:11] because Jacob and Esau is not talking
[1:02:13] about salvation
[1:02:16] Jacob and Esau was talking about a
[1:02:18] Birthright
[1:02:19] which is the top of the baptism of the
[1:02:21] Holy Ghost but Jacob
[1:02:25] he wasn't dealing with trying to get
[1:02:27] stuff away from Esau
[1:02:29] to go to heaven
[1:02:32] did you understand me Sunday I mean I
[1:02:34] don't know where you'd ever thought on
[1:02:35] that line Jacob and Esau is not talking
[1:02:38] about salvation he's talking about
[1:02:39] natural properties
[1:02:44] Jacob wanted the birthright
[1:02:47] which meant a double portion
[1:02:51] the birthright was supposed to go to the
[1:02:53] oldest
[1:02:54] when it already said the younger would
[1:02:57] you know the older would serve the
[1:02:59] younger so there was nothing that could
[1:03:00] be done back there in it
[1:03:02] but Jacob and Esau not talking about
[1:03:04] Heavenly matters Jacob and Esau talking
[1:03:07] about natural things
[1:03:13] it wasn't that Jacob loved God
[1:03:18] and Esau hated God
[1:03:22] I wonder what it was
[1:03:24] it's over a Birthright
[1:03:30] Esau sold it out for a
[1:03:33] Mr meal cause he was starving to death
[1:03:36] he's hungry
[1:03:40] see that touch
[1:03:43] you and I
[1:03:48] and I that's a type of salvation
[1:03:51] to where you and I
[1:03:54] want the birthright
[1:03:57] the new birth
[1:04:00] he saw was was one it was just
[1:04:04] it didn't matter
[1:04:07] he's like a worldly person today that it
[1:04:09] don't matter
[1:04:10] you know
[1:04:13] but Jacob wanted that natural Birthright
[1:04:17] get your story straight and in the 50
[1:04:20] picture
[1:04:24] Esau then
[1:04:26] he didn't care
[1:04:31] he didn't care about
[1:04:34] all this other
[1:04:39] he just wanted something to eat
[1:04:41] all right
[1:04:45] but see that's a type
[1:04:49] of you Desiring the New Birth when other
[1:04:52] people's not Desiring it
[1:04:56] all right so what's God looking at
[1:05:00] oh shyster
[1:05:04] that's what Jacob was
[1:05:08] you mean God likes a shyster better than
[1:05:10] he likes a good person
[1:05:13] come on
[1:05:15] we're going back to the foreknowledge
[1:05:22] Jacob what
[1:05:23] what but a steer
[1:05:25] he stole that by Birthright
[1:05:31] come on get your natural story ride
[1:05:34] wouldn't that be something brother dick
[1:05:35] come to me and starving to death
[1:05:39] I'd send him say
[1:05:41] okay give me 20 bucks I'll feed you a
[1:05:43] meal
[1:05:45] I said yeah but I'm starving to death
[1:05:48] I'm famished
[1:05:50] give me 20 bucks
[1:05:52] I sure ain't Christianity
[1:05:56] that's a natural story all right
[1:06:01] but with a spiritual application to come
[1:06:04] in that you and I
[1:06:06] but would you today would you deny
[1:06:08] somebody's salvation that would want to
[1:06:10] come to you and talk to you about the
[1:06:12] Lord
[1:06:13] well I'm I'm predestinated seat I don't
[1:06:16] need fool around the rest y'all guys you
[1:06:18] tell me that ain't the message right now
[1:06:20] I'll tell you you need to get some tapes
[1:06:22] and start listening to it
[1:06:32] oh my god listen Jacob was a natural
[1:06:36] story
[1:06:39] that typed your new birth
[1:06:44] Esau was a natural human being
[1:06:49] see that's why you can't go in the Bible
[1:06:51] and take things out of it just any way
[1:06:53] you want to
[1:06:57] now what about Jacob being the dirty
[1:07:00] Rascal he was that wouldn't give his
[1:07:02] brother his meal and stole his
[1:07:03] Birthright
[1:07:05] come on
[1:07:07] but have you ever read the rest of the
[1:07:08] story
[1:07:13] Jacob's names came to Israel but he's on
[1:07:16] his way back home
[1:07:17] he's scared to death and he saw because
[1:07:19] he figured he's going to kill him right
[1:07:23] right by every right he saw header out
[1:07:25] to kill him he was a shyster
[1:07:32] but when he got back there we saw this
[1:07:34] one of them right crafty
[1:07:38] Hallelujah grabbed him and started
[1:07:40] hugging him
[1:07:41] he said it's actually a family
[1:07:44] is that your family
[1:07:47] and check if he's trying to give him
[1:07:48] everything he saw says I don't need none
[1:07:50] of your stuff I got plenty come on
[1:07:54] you don't have to read all the story
[1:08:00] we talk about how that Sarah and the you
[1:08:04] know found the Water of Life
[1:08:06] but we don't ever talk about Hagar when
[1:08:08] she was laying on without crying out for
[1:08:10] that baby
[1:08:12] and God came down
[1:08:16] and spoke to Hagar and said tires the
[1:08:19] water get it and you're in the child to
[1:08:20] live
[1:08:22] so that was where natural things to type
[1:08:32] yeah we talk about foreknowledge
[1:08:37] could we be using that as this what I'm
[1:08:39] talking about
[1:08:41] not going all the way back to see what
[1:08:44] would cause the four dollies to happen
[1:08:47] see I'm not through with the message I'm
[1:08:49] just getting started
[1:08:52] something triggered that for knowledge
[1:08:56] what was it
[1:09:03] something caused me to think
[1:09:08] it's the only one he just thought about
[1:09:09] what he was going to do that's a good
[1:09:11] point to hold you for a while
[1:09:16] because I said let's get into the story
[1:09:18] of the Bible let's get into the things
[1:09:19] of God
[1:09:24] let's don't stamp this thing and make it
[1:09:27] one way
[1:09:35] let's think about the choices we've made
[1:09:43] read around and said how could that
[1:09:45] predestinated seed and he said it did
[1:09:48] end up then that rehab to harlot
[1:09:54] she was a predestinated seat
[1:10:01] but see we got it all figured out
[1:10:04] so we've left our predestination to
[1:10:06] determined in factor and thoughts and
[1:10:08] now we're on for knowledge with amen
[1:10:10] we're on a good place to start
[1:10:13] I said start
[1:10:17] we're in a good place to start thinking
[1:10:19] about ourselves
[1:10:21] and thinking about the choices we made
[1:10:24] in life
[1:10:26] and the things that caused us to come to
[1:10:29] this message of the hour
[1:10:31] and you hear the word of God
[1:10:40] the Bible said it sacrifice and
[1:10:42] offerings I would as not
[1:10:45] you know the Bible says God's nostrils
[1:10:47] he said my nostrils are stinking
[1:10:50] with all your sacrifices and offerings
[1:10:57] but he said an honest and a contrite
[1:10:59] heart
[1:11:00] is what I desire
[1:11:06] do we make mistakes we just been through
[1:11:08] all of that
[1:11:10] the Christians fall in sin yes we sin
[1:11:12] every day
[1:11:14] but our sin is not the word unbelief
[1:11:17] you've got to break that down if you
[1:11:19] don't you've done isolated yourself out
[1:11:21] and stamped your Doctrine
[1:11:25] with a period and you can't understand
[1:11:30] but before knowledge you can look back
[1:11:38] and you can see
[1:11:43] you can see why David could be a man
[1:11:46] after God's Own Heart
[1:11:49] yet he'd have a man killed to get his
[1:11:51] wife
[1:11:58] see we'll get down one of these days to
[1:12:00] understand what God is dealing with
[1:12:05] and why would he hate Esau because he
[1:12:08] knew Esau wouldn't make no difference
[1:12:10] we sing that song wait a little longer
[1:12:12] please Jesus until we get our families
[1:12:14] in
[1:12:15] I want to see my family serving God yes
[1:12:18] I've claimed every one of them and
[1:12:19] they'll come I believe it
[1:12:22] because I'll be there with my Offspring
[1:12:23] I've claimed those scriptures and I'll
[1:12:25] believe them
[1:12:29] but you know what that makes
[1:12:32] that makes a hard Road for them
[1:12:35] like I used to tell June when Wade was
[1:12:37] backslid I said every time I look at him
[1:12:39] I said I laugh and I didn't mean I'll
[1:12:41] laugh at him and making fun of him
[1:12:43] I had no thoughts for that I said I lied
[1:12:46] I said because I know what he's going to
[1:12:48] go through
[1:12:50] you say go through bad things in your
[1:12:52] life about it yeah because God was going
[1:12:54] to get his attention
[1:13:00] here's your predestination there's your
[1:13:02] full knowledge
[1:13:05] if you can believe
[1:13:08] can I quote the prophet
[1:13:11] he said if you don't have enough
[1:13:14] ability to believe for your family
[1:13:17] he says I doubt you're believing for
[1:13:21] yourself
[1:13:24] is that what he said
[1:13:29] yeah but I just don't see brother Dale
[1:13:31] how things can be changed
[1:13:35] why did you stamp them
[1:13:38] you stepped them predestinated
[1:13:42] you stopped your families predetermined
[1:13:44] when you said that no hope
[1:13:48] that's what I know I got in trouble
[1:13:49] about the marriage and divorce I got
[1:13:50] into trouble about everything but I stay
[1:13:53] in it I want and don't worry about it
[1:13:55] I say God is there for you if you can
[1:13:57] accept him
[1:13:59] don't worry about what you've done and
[1:14:01] didn't do right
[1:14:04] right at least be a Jacob and have a
[1:14:06] desire for the birthright
[1:14:11] desire for God to come and live in your
[1:14:13] heart
[1:14:18] but brother Dale I've prayed for my
[1:14:20] families and they just ain't come
[1:14:24] you're gonna quit
[1:14:28] poor little guy
[1:14:31] you want somebody to pet you
[1:14:37] keep praying keep crying out before God
[1:14:41] until they come
[1:14:46] and then when you see them come you'll
[1:14:48] realize
[1:14:52] can I say it this way
[1:14:55] you'll realize that you had something to
[1:14:57] do
[1:14:58] with your family coming
[1:15:02] now stamp that with a predetermined or
[1:15:04] just roll it over to foreignology either
[1:15:06] way you want to
[1:15:12] God knew whether or not she was going to
[1:15:13] pray for your children
[1:15:17] as I said while ago there's no such
[1:15:19] thing as wait a longer until people get
[1:15:21] saved no there ain't going to be one
[1:15:23] person there that's not saved
[1:15:29] for knowledge
[1:15:33] a knowledge beforehand
[1:15:39] now I'm going to end it with doing it
[1:15:41] this way then
[1:15:47] did God before the world sit down and
[1:15:49] think this thing out
[1:15:53] in his foreknowledge
[1:15:59] or are we living God's
[1:16:02] part
[1:16:05] are we living it
[1:16:09] are we in the foreknowledge of God
[1:16:21] is this what it is
[1:16:23] well if you don't say sit back before
[1:16:25] the world saw it but okay go ahead this
[1:16:28] still is what it is
[1:16:32] all things are possible what
[1:16:35] to God yes
[1:16:37] that's not what the Bible says that all
[1:16:40] things are possible to them that believe
[1:16:45] come on folks you believe enough to get

[1:18:52] I'm a firm believer
[1:18:54] in God before the world ever begun
[1:18:57] could look down through time
[1:19:00] and see every spec second
[1:19:02] have you ever heard this in the prophet
[1:19:04] he said he never gnat
[1:19:06] and every time that nap would bat its
[1:19:08] eye
[1:19:09] and how much tower that and that would
[1:19:11] make I never didn't know that's made
[1:19:13] Tyler but evidently do because he said
[1:19:15] they did
[1:19:19] but yet I don't look at it then it's
[1:19:21] tomorrow that something happens I said
[1:19:23] well that was just God God knew that's
[1:19:25] going to happen now I wonder what he
[1:19:27] knows gonna happen next you're going to
[1:19:29] scare yourself to death
[1:19:33] I walked day by day saying Lord
[1:19:36] there is no future to me
[1:19:40] and I don't want my past
[1:19:42] I just want to live day by day
[1:19:47] I just want to be what I am today
[1:19:51] I told my wife the other day I just
[1:19:55] kind of a little cranky I guess whether
[1:19:57] or not I just apologize you know what I
[1:19:58] said she didn't even understand it she
[1:20:00] told me she didn't
[1:20:02] I said honey forgive me for being what I
[1:20:04] am
[1:20:07] she said forgive me for being what you
[1:20:09] are
[1:20:11] no need to try and explain it I just
[1:20:12] left the room
[1:20:21] but listen church I believe in an
[1:20:22] eternal God
[1:20:24] I believe in his eternal wisdom that he
[1:20:26] could look down through time
[1:20:29] and he could see today having to be here
[1:20:31] in the church
[1:20:37] but I know he could be looking at your
[1:20:39] desires right now
[1:20:43] he's looking at the desires we have
[1:20:45] right now
[1:20:51] I've always told you a secret
[1:20:54] many many years ago
[1:20:56] I told you a secret way
[1:20:59] to do things
[1:21:02] how many remembers this story
[1:21:06] I said when you're set and listening to
[1:21:07] some preacher
[1:21:10] he's brought down the presence of God to
[1:21:12] you and he begins to explain God to you
[1:21:14] and talking
[1:21:16] and this is about the time he revealed
[1:21:18] something to you I said just raise your
[1:21:20] hand and say my family
[1:21:25] you'll find out one of these days that's
[1:21:27] no garbage can that's a way of knowing

[1:21:58] and I'm not over under
[1:22:01] I'm here you know God's not over there
[1:22:04] and God's not back there God is here
[1:22:07] with you and I because he said I'll be
[1:22:09] with you always
[1:22:10] no he didn't say always we want to
[1:22:13] translate that don't we
[1:22:14] it is always looking up and he said I'll
[1:22:16] wait
[1:22:18] always would mean he would be there all
[1:22:21] the time no matter what she'd done he'd
[1:22:22] be he's not going to do it because
[1:22:23] sometimes he's going to take his
[1:22:25] blindfold away from us but he's going to
[1:22:27] be there all way
[1:22:28] all the way through the Journey
[1:22:32] he's going to be with me
