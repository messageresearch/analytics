[0:00] thank you
[0:22] brother Joe's got all the my notes from
[0:25] last uh the last time so if you want to
[0:27] print them out or anything
[0:28] Joe
[0:45] all right last time we were on verse six
[0:48] and the Lord said in the
[0:51] cane wire that Roth and why is that
[0:53] counting was falling if thou do us well
[0:55] shall thou not be accepted
[0:58] and if thou doest not well send life at
[1:00] the door and underneath shall be his
[1:01] desire and thou shalt rule everything
[1:04] so just to recap we started talking
[1:07] about how the devil will put things in
[1:09] your path when you want to be saved when
[1:11] you want to be healed and this is one of
[1:13] the things that you when you want to be
[1:14] to when you're seeking the Holy Ghost
[1:16] then put in your path that
[1:19] something in your past is keeping you
[1:21] from being from receiving the holy ghost
[1:23] or your genealogy
[1:25] so we talked about
[1:27] um
[1:27] we went through
[1:30] lots of different people in the Bible
[1:32] that do not have
[1:33] uh the best genealogies and I just found
[1:36] this quote
[1:38] last night that I wanted to read
[1:44] and talked about whether or not Cain
[1:46] could be saved
[1:49] I'll read this real slow because this is
[1:50] such a good quote
[1:52] that's in the token
[1:56] paragraph 357.
[1:59] now if you I'm gonna do this a long
[2:01] quote so I'm gonna read it and I'll tell
[2:03] you when I'm getting to the good part
[2:04] now if you get that in Genesis 4 10 then
[2:07] in Hebrews 12 24 start reading he's
[2:10] talking about how the blood of Jesus
[2:13] speaks better things in the blood of
[2:14] Abel in Hebrews 10 12 to 4 said the
[2:18] blood of Jesus speak of better things
[2:20] than that available
[2:22] see Abel he was a righteous man he died
[2:25] he died innocent because he was in the
[2:27] way
[2:28] he was in the way standing for the real
[2:30] Revelation he had
[2:32] spoke and cried out
[2:34] the Justice blood of evil cried out
[2:36] against Cain
[2:38] but the blood of Jesus Christ not only
[2:40] cried out he redeemed
[2:43] amen
[2:45] better things
[2:47] now here comes get ready pay attention
[2:50] it makes you sons and daughters
[2:53] it hides you from the wrath of God see
[2:56] the blood of Abel could not hide cane
[2:59] see but the blood of Jesus can amen amen
[3:02] so old Cain come out today if you've
[3:05] been a persecutor against the word and
[3:06] say days of Miracles has passed this
[3:08] thing is all nonsense and things
[3:10] is crying out you see the blood of Jesus
[3:13] Christ Cries Out
[3:14] but there is forgiveness in it if you'll
[3:17] just accept it wish we could stay a
[3:19] little while on that see blood speakers
[3:21] better things
[3:23] the blood of Jesus Christ has been
[3:24] covered from all sins and you know
[3:27] God gave Canaan promise and he's giving
[3:29] us a promise too that if he said if he
[3:32] that comes to me all in no wise cast out
[3:35] if you come to him you don't have to
[3:36] worry about your genealogy or the things
[3:40] that your parents did or anything if you
[3:43] have a desire come and you can receive
[3:45] it
[3:47] huh
[3:53] and I think last time we talked about um
[3:56] if thou do it's not well same life at
[3:59] the door underneath shall be his desire
[4:00] because
[4:01] um
[4:03] a Christian is
[4:05] God washes out for the Christian puts it
[4:08] puts us over the bill
[4:12] let's see
[4:14] let's go to verse 8.
[4:17] and Cain talked with Abel his brother
[4:19] and it came to pass when they were in
[4:21] the field that Cain rose up against
[4:22] Abel's brother and slew him
[4:26] now last time we went through John
[4:28] chapter eight and looked at the
[4:31] conversation that Jesus had with the
[4:32] Pharisees
[4:33] and uh
[4:35] if you if you put two and two together
[4:37] we know Kane talked with Abel
[4:39] and then Kane got really upset so just
[4:43] putting two two together we know I I
[4:46] believe that the conversation was able
[4:48] to own King's revelation
[4:50] and you know it's still true today when
[4:55] somebody an unbeliever a lot many times
[4:59] they see your Revelation or hear your
[5:02] experience with God and
[5:03] they uh
[5:06] let's turn the numbers 14.
[5:15] because uh there's this is the story of
[5:18] today's Cornelia
[5:20] and there's a little detail in here that
[5:22] a lot of people usually when you tell
[5:25] the story you remember about Joshua and
[5:28] Caleb uh coming back and they testified
[5:30] that we can take the land and all the
[5:32] other
[5:33] all the others did uh there's no way we
[5:36] can take the land
[5:38] that ties in with what came to Abel
[5:44] see
[5:46] let's start at verse one let's just read
[5:48] the whole story
[5:50] chapter 14 of Numbers verse 1.
[5:54] and all the congregation lifted up their
[5:56] voice and cried and the people whipped
[5:58] that night
[5:59] and all the children of Israel murmur
[6:01] against Moses and against Aaron
[6:04] and the whole congregation said unto
[6:06] them with God that we had died in the
[6:07] land of Egypt with God we had died in
[6:10] his wilderness
[6:12] I'm wearing four hath the Lord brought
[6:14] us into this land
[6:16] follow my sore that our wives and our
[6:18] children should be afraid we're not
[6:20] better for us to return unto Egypt
[6:22] and they said one to another let us make
[6:25] a captain and let us return into Egypt
[6:29] then Moses and Heir and fell on their
[6:31] faces before all the Assembly of the
[6:33] congregation of the children of Israel
[6:35] and Joshua the son of nun and Caleb the
[6:38] son of jafana
[6:39] which were of them that searched the
[6:41] land rent their clothes
[6:43] and they speak I think about this
[6:46] they've been they've told their
[6:48] revelation we can take the land just
[6:50] like Abel told his revelation
[6:54] and they're speaking to all the company
[6:56] of the children of Israel saying the
[6:58] land which we pass through to search it
[7:01] is an exceedingly good exceeding good
[7:03] land
[7:04] if the Lord delighted us then he will
[7:06] bring us into this land and give it to
[7:08] us a land which floweth with a milk and
[7:11] honey
[7:12] only Rebel not you against the Lord
[7:14] neither fear ye the people of the land
[7:17] for they have bread for us their defense
[7:19] has departed from them and the Lord Is
[7:21] With Us fear them not
[7:24] here's what came to the table but all
[7:27] the congregation babes Stone them with
[7:30] stones and the glory of the Lord
[7:32] appeared in the Tabernacle of the
[7:34] congregation before all the children of
[7:36] Israel so they just didn't say I don't
[7:38] believe it they were ready to kill them
[7:43] um
[7:43] so let's read um
[7:46] let's look at a few cloaks that brother
[7:49] Brandon said about this conversation
[7:52] and what Cain did in the mark of the
[7:54] beast
[7:55] 1961 he said now we find out that the
[7:58] calls that Cain listened to the enemy
[8:01] then what happened he become the first
[8:03] murderer
[8:04] he become the first one that had
[8:06] jealousy
[8:08] let me skip down and see
[8:11] came by taking on this evil took the
[8:14] first Mark God marked him no one was to
[8:17] kill him let him alone
[8:18] but you remember as soon as he marked
[8:21] him he went out from the presence of God
[8:22] hold on to that now
[8:26] no one was to kill him and if you look
[8:28] at it we'll we'll go down through all
[8:30] the
[8:31] stories of uh people that have been
[8:33] marked but you look at that kides Barney
[8:36] they didn't
[8:38] it was just Moses and Joshua and Caleb
[8:40] and they didn't tell everybody else to
[8:42] get out they still stayed with him for
[8:45] 40 years and went through the Wilderness
[8:46] that weren't excommunicated unless we'll
[8:49] see what brother Brown says about that
[8:51] in just a second and I will restore
[8:53] saith the Lord
[8:55] he said that's true certainly God is the
[8:58] only Creator but through the spirit that
[9:00] he let come upon him
[9:02] that's why candy did what he did because
[9:04] of the spirit that he let he allowed he
[9:08] accepted Satan's life
[9:10] you couldn't attach that evil thing of
[9:12] Cain upon God where did he get that
[9:13] nature he had to be jealous from Satan
[9:16] his father
[9:18] the Jehovah Jireh
[9:23] and what is a sinner a man that drinks a
[9:26] man that commits adultery what is a
[9:28] sinner an unbeliever
[9:29] no matter how religious you are and how
[9:32] holy you are that has nothing to do with
[9:34] it you're Holiness would nothing like
[9:36] come up to the Pharisees and Sadducees
[9:38] and Jesus said you are your father the
[9:40] devil
[9:40] and the works of your father you'll do
[9:42] he that believeth not is condemned
[9:44] already and every unbeliever must go to
[9:46] hell
[9:48] so what makes you a child of the devil
[9:50] no matter how many Sensational outfits
[9:53] are you must be born again 1961. no
[9:55] matter how many Sensations you have
[9:57] still a child of Satan until you become
[9:59] dead to the world and alive in Christ
[10:01] listen quickly now
[10:04] in Luke 16 13 that I'll just read it
[10:06] real quick no servant can serve two
[10:08] masters for either who will hate the one
[10:10] and love the other else he will hold to
[10:11] the one and despise the other he cannot
[10:13] serve God and Mammon in First John 3 9
[10:15] 10 whosoever is born of God does not
[10:18] commit sin for his seed remaineth in him
[10:20] and cannot sin because because he's born
[10:22] of God
[10:23] and this
[10:24] the children of God are manifest and the
[10:27] children of the devil whosoever did not
[10:29] do without righteousness is not of God
[10:31] neither he that loveth not his brother
[10:34] now let's move on down to chapter to
[10:37] verse 9.
[10:42] said unto King
[10:45] where is Abel thy brother
[10:47] and he says
[10:49] I know y'all am I My Brother's Keeper
[10:55] well that's another way of saying
[10:58] aren't you my brother's people
[11:03] which is just unbelievable the
[11:05] rationalist that he had
[11:09] and furthermore he didn't know
[11:12] he committed a sin and that sin led to
[11:14] another sin
[11:15] that he told a lie right
[11:20] and uh I was
[11:23] I found this this really good quote that
[11:25] irenia said
[11:28] um he wrote this uh
[11:32] he wrote a big book called against
[11:34] heresies when uh
[11:38] when he was alive
[11:40] see and he said and he was not soft he's
[11:43] talking about this verse
[11:45] and he was not softened even by this nor
[11:47] did he stopped short for that evil deed
[11:49] but being asked for his brother was he
[11:51] said I know not am I My Brother's Keeper
[11:53] extending and aggravating his wickedness
[11:55] by his answer
[11:57] if it is a wicked to slay a brother much
[11:59] worse as it does insolently and never
[12:01] ever irrelevantly irreverently
[12:03] to reply to the omniscient God as if he
[12:06] could battle him
[12:08] and for this he did himself very curse
[12:11] about with him
[12:12] because he gratuitously brought an
[12:14] offering of sin having had no reverence
[12:16] for God
[12:17] nor being put to Confusion by the act of
[12:20] fracture side franchise Killian brother
[12:22] and sister
[12:24] so he's
[12:27] he's not concerned at all for his soul
[12:32] the verse 10 and he said what has thou
[12:36] do in the voice of thyroid blood cries
[12:38] unto me from the ground and we knew
[12:41] about Hebrews 12 24 that says unto Jesus
[12:44] the mediator of the New Covenant into
[12:46] the blood of sprinkling that speaketh
[12:47] better things than that available
[12:49] so let's compare
[12:51] the two what the two uh
[12:55] what what Abel's blood and Jesus was
[12:58] said well you know the blood is just
[13:01] chemistry it doesn't speak what speaks
[13:04] is the life behind the blood the Abel's
[13:06] blood
[13:07] spoke
[13:09] he cried out for justice
[13:11] they came and killed him
[13:14] but Jesus blood identifies us with him
[13:19] and speaks forgiveness
[13:22] speaks perfection
[13:24] and the token brother random said how
[13:27] can the chemistry speak it's the life
[13:28] that's in the blood that does the
[13:30] speaking
[13:31] the soul that was in King and cried out
[13:33] or enable it was a life that was in
[13:36] Christ that cries out better things than
[13:37] any it speaks and it speaks loud it's
[13:40] the Holy Spirit
[13:42] it speaks plain it tells us that the
[13:44] time is here
[13:46] when we see it where it said it would
[13:48] say it and then we see it come back and
[13:50] identify what it said
[13:52] there's nothing else left but to believe
[13:55] it
[13:55] that's right to receive it
[14:01] and also in the token
[14:04] he he talks about this a lot
[14:07] we find out the blood does speak it
[14:10] speaks in your behalf
[14:11] the life that's in you speaks from the
[14:13] shed blood amen oh brother I wish
[14:15] everybody could see that see if you can
[14:17] see what it is the life that's in you
[14:19] see that blood is identifying you with
[14:21] it it's the token
[14:23] what it is the blood was shed for you
[14:25] you've accepted and the life that's
[14:27] coming to you you have the token that's
[14:29] the Holy Spirit
[14:31] Paul tells us that the blood speaks that
[14:33] anyone knows the blood is actually
[14:35] itself can't speak
[14:37] it's a chemistry is that right how many
[14:39] knows that
[14:40] but how many knows that the blood speaks
[14:43] what about your brother said his blood
[14:45] cries from the earth against you is that
[14:48] right his blood is a speaking God said
[14:50] what about him he said am I My Brother's
[14:52] Keeper said his blood is crying out his
[14:54] blood isn't crying out it's a token
[14:57] it's a token that he had been killed his
[14:59] blood was crying out against him
[15:02] and then also in the token was the one
[15:04] that I just read about
[15:06] uh it makes you Sons and Daughters it
[15:08] hides you from the wrath of God the
[15:10] blood of Abel cannot hide Kings even the
[15:12] blood of Jesus can
[15:16] now let's look at verse 11.
[15:19] okay
[15:21] and now are thou cursed from the Earth
[15:25] which hath opened her mouth to receive
[15:27] that Blood Brothers blood
[15:33] so he's cursed from receiving any
[15:36] benefit and enjoying the fruits on the
[15:38] Earth
[15:39] uh in the next verse and we'll see how
[15:42] he's cursed from even
[15:43] having any kind of settled
[15:45] being able to enjoy just a peaceful life
[15:49] let's look at that verse 12. when thou
[15:51] tillest the ground it shall not
[15:53] henceforth yield unto thee her feet her
[15:55] strength
[15:56] fugitive and a vagabond shall thou be in
[15:58] the Earth
[16:00] and he gave him
[16:02] it's an addition to Adam's curse if you
[16:04] go back to Genesis 3 17.
[16:08] he said that curse was to Adam he said
[16:11] because I was talking into the voice of
[16:12] thy wife and that's eating of the tree
[16:14] for which I commanded these things thou
[16:16] shall not eat of it curse it is the
[16:18] ground that I say can sorrow shall I eat
[16:20] of it all the days of my life in
[16:22] addition to that now all the ground's
[16:24] not gonna
[16:26] um
[16:26] yield unto thee her strength
[16:29] and this was particular to Cain because
[16:31] he was that was his occupation with a
[16:33] farmer
[16:36] in verse 13.
[16:37] and Cain said unto the Lord my
[16:39] punishment is greater than I can bear
[16:43] and it seems like he got off pretty easy
[16:45] for killing his killing his brother
[16:47] Kane's not really so much interested in
[16:50] his own salvation
[16:52] he's interested in
[16:53] how bad he's gonna get punished
[16:59] he's actually complaining about the
[17:00] mercy of God
[17:08] we mentioned earlier about um
[17:13] sitting away your day of Grace and this
[17:15] is another thing that the devil will
[17:16] kind of throw in your way
[17:18] so let's read some quotes about
[17:21] you know Kings Kings crossing the line
[17:24] and what happens when you cross the line
[17:26] is you just
[17:27] you don't really care
[17:29] sweet roast fruit or brown said about it
[17:31] and it misses expectancy 1953
[17:35] he's talking to somebody coming through
[17:36] the prayer line he says howdy do sir now
[17:38] there's something strange about you sir
[17:41] Satan has desire to take your life
[17:43] you are all tore up
[17:46] you think you send away your day of
[17:48] Grace
[17:48] you think your life is ruined do you
[17:50] love Jesus what makes you love it
[17:53] before there could be anything to their
[17:55] make you love him there has to be a
[17:57] Creator to create the love in your heart
[18:00] is that right if you'd send away your
[18:02] day of Grace you would hate Jesus but
[18:05] you love him and you're all right and
[18:07] the devil's just lying to you you're
[18:09] nervous come here and I'll cast him away
[18:10] for for you if you'll believe do you
[18:13] believe it
[18:17] he prays for him and he says now you're
[18:19] all right
[18:20] now you can raise your head feel all
[18:22] right now son is that all right the
[18:24] Devils you have committed suicide in a
[18:26] few days that was on his mind he thought
[18:29] he'd send away his day of Grace when he
[18:31] come up for real black heavy like a fog
[18:33] meeting me in the face
[18:34] that's devils
[18:36] the boy is free now I feel happy go on
[18:39] home rejoicing thanking God for his
[18:41] goodness to you God bless you
[18:43] and the Waters of separation
[18:47] he's talking about a a young girl that
[18:49] buried a husband and started drinking
[18:51] and uh he said I said look do you still
[18:55] have respect for the Lord Jesus she said
[18:57] I do sir
[18:58] I said then he hasn't left you I said no
[19:01] he's still got Mercy for you
[19:03] said you you think he'd receive me like
[19:05] right like this I said yes ma'am
[19:08] I took her by the hand knelt down there
[19:10] that place
[19:12] brother we brought that place up into a
[19:14] prayer meeting and he led her to the
[19:16] Lord Jesus yes
[19:21] speak to the Rock he said listen these
[19:23] churches and things as having a form of
[19:25] godliness but denying the power of the
[19:26] Earth
[19:27] find out they go in there it's not a
[19:29] natural death
[19:30] that's a spiritual death a natural death
[19:33] is not very bad but a spiritual death
[19:35] being separated and cut off from God
[19:37] send away their day of Grace went over
[19:40] and looked out said a bunch of Holy
[19:41] Rollers
[19:42] don't pay any attention to that Devil's
[19:45] in the football that sure is the world
[19:46] certainly so Cain was at a place where
[19:49] he just
[19:50] didn't care anymore
[19:52] number so let's look at verse 14.
[19:58] behold thou has driven me out this day
[20:01] from the face of the Earth
[20:04] and from that face I shall I be here
[20:07] and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond
[20:09] in the Earth
[20:11] and it shall come to pass that everyone
[20:12] that findeth me shall slay me
[20:19] now when it says
[20:22] from thy face shall I be healed he's not
[20:24] talking about from the uh from God
[20:26] knowing anything about him obviously but
[20:29] just from the favoring the will of God
[20:32] and from fellowship with him
[20:34] and I shall be a fugitive in my back and
[20:36] a vagabond in the Earth
[20:38] you know again he's more afraid of uh a
[20:43] natural death
[20:44] than any concerned about his soul
[20:47] and brother random in the mark of the
[20:49] beast and the Seal of God he said
[20:51] the mark of the beast a Wonder
[20:53] refugitive don't know where he's going
[20:55] don't know where he's where he what he
[20:57] knows don't know what he doesn't want
[20:59] he's a fugitive just somebody wondering
[21:05] let's go to the verse 15.
[21:08] just keep on
[21:09] and the Lord said unto him therefore
[21:11] whosoever saith came
[21:14] Vengeance shall be taken on him
[21:16] Sevenfold
[21:17] and the Lord set a mark upon Cain lest
[21:20] any finding him should kill him
[21:22] and you know you can follow this Mark
[21:24] all the way to Revelations where
[21:27] Revelations 13 it says and he calls with
[21:29] all the small and great reason for free
[21:31] and bond to receive a mark in their
[21:33] right hand or in their forehead
[21:35] and then no man might buy ourselves
[21:37] they've either had the Mark or the name
[21:38] of the Beast or the number of his name
[21:41] and the Oneness of unity brother random
[21:43] said what is the mark of the beast
[21:45] unbelief
[21:47] the mark of the beast and the Seal of
[21:49] God 1961 said a mark is a distinction
[21:52] it makes a difference it separates
[21:54] something
[21:55] but like you say you got one Mark
[21:57] against you to mark but you never said
[21:59] you had one seal against you you got one
[22:01] Mark against you
[22:02] and the seal is a sign of ownership a
[22:05] Mark it's a distinction
[22:07] when the church is sealed by the Holy
[22:09] Spirit showing his ownership God owns
[22:11] the church the mark of the beast is the
[22:13] way with the outcasts that refused to
[22:15] take and come God's provided away
[22:18] Kane as soon as he was marked was sent
[22:20] away
[22:21] to death
[22:24] the mark of the beast and the still of
[22:26] gods paragraph e69 he said he that sins
[22:29] what is sin unbelief
[22:31] you turn your back on God what do you do
[22:33] then steal yourself away and take the
[22:35] mark of the beast and go off like Cain
[22:37] did for the presence of God
[22:39] come right up to the borderline and then
[22:41] don't believe it you believe it but
[22:42] you're scared to take it
[22:44] you get that sentence willfully just
[22:45] believe willfully after he's received
[22:47] the knowledge of the truth
[22:49] there remaineth no more sacrifice for
[22:51] sin
[22:52] it's a fearful thing to fall into the
[22:54] hands of the Living God
[22:56] the mark of the beasts and the Son of
[22:58] God are E71 now after this night it's on
[23:02] your hands eat it will just believe it
[23:04] willfully after he has received
[23:06] knowledge of the truth seeing the angel
[23:09] of the Lord coming
[23:10] proving everything at the last day
[23:12] seeing the Everlasting gospel being
[23:14] preached by Luther sanctification by
[23:16] Wesley and all the gospel and he'll
[23:18] warning you against Marky and don't turn
[23:20] away come up close to Christ
[23:23] you say now brother Branham that's the
[23:25] mark
[23:26] and this uh
[23:31] when he when he marked King
[23:34] nobody wants to kill him
[23:37] and you can find this uh
[23:40] this kind of thing
[23:42] laid him alone all through the Bible
[23:45] like in uh
[23:50] Hosea chapter 4 17 where Ephraim
[23:55] the tribe of Ephraim
[23:57] went into idolatry and the scripture
[24:01] says that Ephraim is married to his
[24:02] idols leave him alone
[24:07] in Romans 12 19.
[24:10] dearly beloved Avengers not yourselves
[24:12] but rather give place at the Wrath
[24:14] for his written benches his mind I will
[24:16] repeat saith the Lord
[24:18] you remember when the
[24:20] the uh Peter and the other Apostles and
[24:23] disciples were discouraged in the in the
[24:25] temple he said we thank God because
[24:28] we're allowed to suffer the thing the
[24:30] afflictions
[24:31] except for the same reproves that our
[24:33] Lord did
[24:35] they didn't roll back just because
[24:38] somebody
[24:41] treated them poorly or talked talked
[24:44] about the gospel
[24:46] Proverbs 20 22 say not thou I will
[24:48] recompense evil
[24:50] but wait on the Lord and he shall save
[24:52] thee
[24:52] we're almost 12 17 recompense no man for
[24:55] evil provide things honest and the side
[24:58] of all men
[25:01] and uh
[25:03] one story that I think really
[25:05] illustrates this is the story of David
[25:07] and shimmy
[25:09] in second Samuel chapter 16.
[25:16] a lot of times the story has the Bible
[25:18] has so many good stories that
[25:20] illustrates these points a lot of times
[25:21] it just helps too
[25:33] second Samuel chapter 16.
[25:40] let's start at verse five
[25:45] and when King David came to her own
[25:48] behold fence came out of a man of the
[25:50] family of the House of Saul whose name
[25:51] was shimmy the son of Guerra he came
[25:54] forth and cursed still as he came and he
[25:56] cast Souls of David and all the Servants
[25:58] of King David and all the people and all
[26:01] the mighty men were on his right hand
[26:03] and on his left
[26:04] and this says to me when he cursed come
[26:07] out come out thou bloody man and thou
[26:08] man of Belial the Lord hath returned
[26:11] upon me all the blood of the House of
[26:12] Saul and who stead the ice rain and the
[26:14] Lord hath delivered the kingdom into the
[26:16] hand of Absalom thy son
[26:18] then behold Thou Art taken and I
[26:20] Mischief because thou art a bloody man
[26:23] this is the center of zero I unto the
[26:25] king why should this dead dog curse my
[26:27] Lord the king let me go over I pray thee
[26:29] and take off his head
[26:31] and the King said what have I to do with
[26:33] you you sons of zero why so let him
[26:35] curse because the Lord has said unto him
[26:37] cursed David who shall then say
[26:39] wherefore hast thou done so and David
[26:42] said to abishad had to always servants
[26:43] behold my son which came forth out of my
[26:45] mouth
[26:46] seeketh my life
[26:48] how much more now may this Benjamin do
[26:50] it let him alone and let him curse for
[26:53] the Lord has been him
[26:57] let him alone that whole thing is
[26:59] Through the Bible and somebody curses
[27:01] you to leave them alone and uh
[27:04] let's see what brother Brown said about
[27:05] the discernment of spirit
[27:08] about this story
[27:09] did you notice when David was rejected
[27:12] as king he went out of the city and a
[27:14] little Benjamin Benjamin which was
[27:16] supposed to have been a brother to him
[27:17] should have been sorry because he was
[27:19] convicted
[27:20] but what he was a crippled man and he
[27:22] drugged along there with his crippled
[27:23] condition
[27:24] throwing dirt on David and calling him
[27:26] all kinds of bad names and cursing him
[27:28] in the name of the Lord cursing King
[27:29] David in the name of the Lord this
[27:31] little old crippled up benjamite watch
[27:33] the spirit of God and the spirit of the
[27:35] devil working
[27:36] the spirit of the devil would walk to
[27:40] cut his head off
[27:42] but not the spirit of God
[27:46] I'm deserving the spirit in paragraph
[27:48] four to watch the spirit of Christ and
[27:50] David let him alone for the Lord has
[27:52] told him to curse me do you catch that
[27:54] let him alone the Lord has told him to
[27:56] curse me
[27:58] but then when David returned in glory I
[28:01] mean it returned to his his position of
[28:04] powers like our Lord will return
[28:08] then
[28:09] brother when I said uh that little dirt
[28:12] thrower fell on his face and begged for
[28:14] mercy
[28:15] when the Judgment came
[28:17] let him alone the spirit of Christ in us
[28:20] don't excommunicated
[28:22] let's remember that all these things has
[28:24] got to come to pass we've got one thing
[28:25] to do move on
[28:27] God promised that he'd make everything
[28:29] work together for good to him that love
[28:31] him let's keep the deserving of spirit
[28:32] keep the objective right we're here to
[28:34] serve God each one fellowship and going
[28:36] along and serving God if the man's got
[28:39] the wrong kind of an object objective
[28:41] then what will happen
[28:43] and that's probably a good stop and play
[28:46] for today
[28:49] thank you
