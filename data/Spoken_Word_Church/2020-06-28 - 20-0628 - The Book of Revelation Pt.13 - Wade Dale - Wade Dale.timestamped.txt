[2:07] okay but let's keep their buying up in
[2:11] the prayers for the we have another
[2:12] table the dark traveling to come and
[2:15] that will have a safe and wonderful time
[2:19] in reward the Landrieu Glover is coming

[2:27] have regular service on Sunday but the
[2:29] youth will be conducting the Sunday
[2:31] afternoon service just like always
[2:35] D'Angelo ain't no little part of that
[2:40] John says Annabelle had to drive around
[2:43] because he was 15 years old hearty
[2:45] preaching yeah call brother he's he's
[2:49] rather skinny now he may not married and
[2:51] his wife is trending down I guess but
[2:54] the guys to same good brother good
[2:58] brother angry
[3:02] hey yeah I thank you all right so now
[3:08] we've been talking about the search
[3:09] agents now we know we done took the
[3:13] rapture yes so let's go through this one
[3:18] more time and after this after what
[3:21] after this after the church ages after
[3:24] this which was chapter one two three of
[3:28] Revelation after this I looked and
[3:30] behold a door was open in heaven and the
[3:33] first voice which I heard was as it were
[3:34] of a trumpet talking to me so we know it
[3:36] was the Lord speaking to John typing the
[3:40] bride saying come up hither right and I
[3:45] will show thee things which must be
[3:47] Hereafter
[3:50] now remember the bride goes up in
[3:53] chapter 4:1
[3:56] this is when the bride believes the
[3:57] earth because the turqu ages are over if
[4:01] I got that okay now it's giving we're
[4:06] going to look at thee these are heavenly
[4:07] scenes that we're going to look at her
[4:09] here for a minute because you can't take
[4:12] revelations in five and say it happen
[4:14] that for the rapture you got to have a
[4:16] revelation about this folks I mean you
[4:18] can't just it's not chronologically in
[4:22] order nobody got that it's not we know
[4:26] chapter one two and three but now
[4:28] remember chapter one takes you back to
[4:31] the beginning of the church ages through
[4:35] the church ages and they are in order
[4:38] chapter four is an order as we go the
[4:42] bride of Jesus Christ the born-again
[4:45] believers go up in Chapter four actually
[4:47] for one John topping the bride so we're
[4:51] following John as you would follow the
[4:55] voice of God because he he he heard that
[4:58] voice now I believe it was that same
[5:01] voice that spoke to John it's didn't
[5:03] turn around
[5:03] one that talked to John while Jesus was
[5:07] here on earth so he understood the voice
[5:10] that's why I believe John was
[5:11] commissioned to do all this because John
[5:13] was young and he was with him the whole
[5:15] time right and he was able to understand
[5:19] that this voice he had heard before you
[5:22] and I same way need to hear that same
[5:24] voice say come up hither now come up
[5:28] hither has two meanings come up hither
[5:32] is an actual rapture but if you don't
[5:35] come up hither in Revelation and show
[5:38] these things which must be Hereafter
[5:42] same way with us we have a we have a
[5:45] brother any calls an updated revelation
[5:47] right we don't have to read the
[5:49] newspaper we know what's going to happen
[5:51] we've already bent by the prophet of God
[5:54] and now that getting us through all that
[5:56] we have been put in a place to where
[5:59] like oh they'll say last Sunday with man
[6:01] and brother Bob bro the lease has been
[6:03] preaching about we don't have to worry
[6:05] about what's going on in the world right
[6:08] it should not affect us spiritually now
[6:12] physically when we know that because we
[6:15] live in LA but see we live in the
[6:16] pressure way out of sin but it should
[6:19] not bother us or make us nervous if
[6:22] you're nervous then you need to check
[6:24] you you need to check your spirituality
[6:26] if you're nervous about what's going on
[6:28] okay but we still need to be diligent we
[6:31] still need to be humans use our human
[6:33] brain and I believe we have I believe
[6:36] brother Dale this has took action I
[6:39] think about this morning because there
[6:40] are several churches in the message that
[6:42] Cobra has gotten into just for a second
[6:45] and a couple of big name preachers of
[6:47] God and they're in the hospital but
[6:49] that's not saying one thing about them
[6:51] I'm just telling you brother Dale the
[6:53] first thing he done was he grabbed a
[6:55] prayer cloth and he went applaud him
[6:57] over every door every door in this
[7:01] church has done prayer cloth over it
[7:02] specifically to keep that coating
[7:05] out of this church
[7:06] now I'm just gonna believe that I'm just
[7:09] gonna be dumb enough I think tracks loss
[7:11] will be put everywhere and supernatural
[7:14] things happen so God knows our heart we
[7:18] want to worship God brother Dale when I
[7:19] keep this church going but you don't
[7:21] want them he would not want to make you
[7:23] a target for this thing that's coming
[7:27] around in the world but because the
[7:30] reason I'm saying this is is because I
[7:32] thinking the other day I'm doing the
[7:34] series on the on the you know we start
[7:36] with the Passover but I thought the
[7:39] other day and it's a little bit comical
[7:40] but but it's not it's what God would do
[7:43] because he told the children of Israel
[7:44] he said God said I'm gonna lay these
[7:47] plagues on Israel I mean on Egypt but
[7:51] they're not going to thank you right
[7:53] when it was so dark you couldn't see I
[7:56] was thinking other than just a little
[7:58] just a little given and it's the way I
[8:00] think you know here comes here comes out
[8:03] of the israelian into work into the
[8:05] brick house he's getting ready to make
[8:07] bricks and then here comes Earl the
[8:10] Egyptian in and he looks like ants left
[8:12] three four days he's done balls all over
[8:14] his face he's inching everywhere and and
[8:18] this you know I was ready to go to work
[8:19] he said he's a minute pieces from
[8:21] children of Israel he had no he had no
[8:24] problems in his bed he had no locusts in
[8:27] his hair he had no fleas in his bed but
[8:31] this other God has it's all because
[8:34] remember these rays would all I mean or
[8:36] Israel would go to work they were slaves
[8:38] lit well here the taskmasters are
[8:40] standing there like that you know and
[8:42] everybody knows but see us have got
[8:47] protective people if you'll just take
[8:48] him at his word then you made this word
[8:51] and walk straight on they knew they were
[8:55] the children of Israel and
[8:57] you've got would protect them if you get
[8:58] a revelation like that you ain't gotta
[9:02] worry about Egypt so this one ever
[9:05] worried about Egypt Egypt was always
[9:07] trying to hold on to that the Israeli
[9:10] they were trying to hold on to that
[9:11] group of people to make them work but as
[9:13] we're going to talk about this afternoon
[9:15] finally the Passover came debt came in
[9:18] the count and Pharaoh finally said leave
[9:22] you know I've had enough of this so you
[9:24] know what the devil one day will do the
[9:28] same thing he'll try his best he'll try
[9:31] his best
[9:32] but you remember though as I've been
[9:35] reading also in chronicles and in Kings
[9:37] some of the Kings worshipped God and God
[9:40] blessed them some of the Kings didn't
[9:42] worship done and God brought plagues on
[9:44] them so you have to be careful and say
[9:46] well I'm a Christian nothing can happen
[9:48] to me Don don't be silly
[9:53] no don't tempt God but there's a place
[9:56] we have to go though to where that that
[9:58] we stay with the children of Israel and
[10:00] that we can live in Goshen and that we
[10:03] can that God can protect us from what's
[10:06] coming this is just a pimple of what's
[10:08] coming this is not even this ain't even
[10:12] close to what's coming when we get out
[10:16] of here so anyway so we're fixing to
[10:19] leave now we're leaving here as the
[10:21] pride but we have to come back watch
[10:25] what I'm saying revelation 4 is the
[10:27] scene in heaven not on earth because
[10:32] we're we've come up we're gonna be like
[10:35] I said before we're gonna be for three
[10:38] and a half years the seat now what I
[10:41] took I took my peanuts there
[10:47] here I know I was hoping they weren't
[10:50] there
[11:00] at the bomb plant is a it up at the fire
[11:02] last night tell me all these get that
[11:07] there was no man I used to work with
[11:09] chicken flat they tell me I drop
[11:11] something he said but we're not working
[11:13] at the bomb plant they be our last day
[11:16] so this is a three and a half years that
[11:18] you and I are going to be away from the
[11:23] earth if I got that but from four one
[11:26] two revelations 19 it's not three and a
[11:29] half years yeah I got that that's right
[11:33] so you got dual meaning that's not it's
[11:35] not exactly when we leave yeah we're
[11:38] going to come back to Revelation 19
[11:39] we're going to come back but remember
[11:44] how many years were left after the
[11:46] rapture 14th and Daniel 7 u8 7 years not
[11:50] three and a half so this is going to
[11:51] take place in a seven-year period ok
[11:54] then I got that now revelations for
[11:57] though is a scene in heaven Revelations
[11:59] 5 that's the scene in heaven but
[12:01] remember brother branham emphatic Lee
[12:03] tells us in Revelation chapter 6 that
[12:05] the seals are broken earth none at him
[12:08] so 4 and 5 we're going to talk about a
[12:12] heavenly scene okay revelation 6 we got
[12:16] to come back to earth and he's going to
[12:18] literally break those seals on earth he
[12:22] breaks them to us spiritually breaks
[12:25] them to the world naturally have I got
[12:28] that right
[12:30] then and you've gone revelation 7 8 9 10
[12:37] even 11 12 13 you've got the United
[12:40] States involved in the image to the
[12:44] beach we won't be here 14 15 we'll keep
[12:48] reading a little bit like 16 17 18 19
[12:53] it's when we come back alright so as a
[12:57] timeline
[12:58] as that you and I are going to be here
[13:00] we won't not now listen I've told you a
[13:04] hundred times this is a hundred and
[13:06] first time if you don't able to get a
[13:07] revelation into anything get a
[13:09] revelation one thing you don't have to
[13:11] go through the tribulation if you're
[13:14] born again you are have got a free trip
[13:17] up here and then you've got people in
[13:21] the message in the house and your way
[13:23] what people say but then they go well
[13:25] what are we gonna do for them seven
[13:26] years if you say it's three and a half
[13:27] wheels are gonna help there's nowhere in
[13:29] the Bible that it says the man suffers
[13:31] three-and-a-half you show it to me right
[13:35] away nowhere in the bible does it say
[13:37] we're going to be in heaven in a wedding
[13:39] supper it just says the marriage supper
[13:41] of the lamb no brother branham brings
[13:43] them in that's three and a half years
[13:45] when God's dealing with the Jews
[13:47] we're off Mary so if I got that but we
[13:52] know according to the Bible that thing
[13:54] that has to be seven earthly years left
[13:57] after we leave after church leaves to
[13:59] fulfil dang seventy weeks because
[14:01] nineteen seventy weeks will be fulfilled
[14:03] when we ride back in the Millennium
[14:06] after they build a temple that's how
[14:07] important it is to see damn seventy
[14:09] weeks in that there's not just three and
[14:11] a half years left after the rapture but
[14:14] I have told somebody one time before I
[14:15] said I really this is my intro I don't
[14:19] care what can happen I don't care what
[14:20] we're gonna eat they doesn't matter just
[14:23] get down and then it'll all be made
[14:27] known to us and you know what we're in
[14:29] eternity anyway this time elements gonna
[14:32] be back down here on this earth because
[14:35] we've already look from right here we
[14:39] have took a body change we have entered
[14:41] into the eighth day in body
[14:44] we don't have listen time was no longer
[14:47] inside of you when you got morning in
[14:49] but we're still in time obviously we
[14:52] have
[14:52] more slowly right but one day though
[14:59] Abraham woke up and he didn't have to
[15:03] crawl out of bed he jumped up out there
[15:06] because he was changed back to a 20 year
[15:08] old young man so we take a change right
[15:11] here that's final in the Bible this one
[15:15] revelation 4:1 tells you there was a
[15:20] group of people that had a revelation of
[15:24] a resurrection there was a resurrection
[15:27] of the dead Saints that were born again
[15:29] all down through the church ages right
[15:30] here in this one scripture we took a
[15:34] body change and we the director with
[15:37] them doughnuts nobody on the earth at
[15:40] this point there's no one on the earth
[15:42] except two witnesses 144,000 and all the
[15:47] other whatever you want to call them who
[15:51] the Spurgeon people will never get
[15:53] eternal life the Beast the Catholic
[15:57] Church you have counterpart at the
[15:58] Catholic Church still be here but we
[16:02] will not so let's don't worry about how
[16:04] long the time we got but we must place
[16:06] it to be able to see the book of
[16:08] Revelation you can't see the book of
[16:10] Revelation for that same 1970 week you
[16:12] cannot you can't place it there is
[16:15] nowhere you can place it anywhere in
[16:18] scripture unless you understand seven
[16:21] movies a day because when we leave right
[16:25] here when that when that period when he
[16:28] says come up here there no you think
[16:29] period rest of the image to the youth
[16:33] that's my brother around so in fact the
[16:35] rest of them now for one I mean four and
[16:37] five is heavenly same with six one is
[16:40] the plates being poured out and all the
[16:42] vowels and all based on people on earth
[16:43] and wonderful
[16:44] for thousands call them you're not going
[16:46] to be here but we have to have every
[16:50] scripture revealed to us spiritually
[16:53] because we are spiritual view just like
[16:55] today there's a natural jus that's gonna
[16:59] naturally things going to happen but you
[17:00] and I are Jews and spiritual that's
[17:03] baked because we can go back to the Old
[17:05] Testament and we can relive the Passover
[17:09] not as killing over the coming of a baby
[17:13] sheep yes we know that it's a simple and
[17:18] tight that the Lamb of God came God came
[17:21] on earth and He gave His life on the
[17:24] Passover day the very day they killed
[17:27] the lamb they were killing two lambs at
[17:29] one time they were killing Jesus the
[17:32] perfect lamb and they were killing a
[17:33] regular lamb because it was Passover he
[17:36] died on exactly the day that they killed
[17:39] the Passover lamb and then we know what
[17:43] happened after that but we just going to
[17:44] stick on Passover right now so on
[17:46] upstairs with me so now immediately I
[17:49] was in the spirit so watch he wasn't he
[17:52] wasn't in the natural you know in other
[17:55] words he was sure he was standing on her
[17:57] but God took him up to a place to show
[17:59] them things that must be Hereafter
[18:02] I'm telling you this because you and
[18:04] your human brain are going to come back
[18:07] to earth with a bunch of this stuff of
[18:08] this of this scripture don't do that
[18:11] it's a heavenly scene because number one
[18:15] I throw them what's that in heaven and
[18:17] one sat on the throne now there's
[18:18] revelations of one God Peter said I look
[18:22] like Jasper and sardine stone it was a
[18:23] rainbow about the throne now like
[18:25] brother Graham stated you'll read in the
[18:26] church age book we only stay a half
[18:29] rainbow and he quotes of the
[18:34] the song that happens you have been told
[18:36] we got a half but when we get to heaven
[18:39] that's a full rainbow is so it's a full
[18:42] revelation and I believe that's what
[18:45] we're getting right now we got to have a
[18:46] full revelation here to take it to that
[18:48] place
[18:49] okay leave we can't have a half
[18:52] revelation we gotta have a full
[18:53] revelation because remember the four
[18:55] words been made known in the end time
[18:57] that's what's going to change our body
[18:59] say John couldn't take the change
[19:01] God didn't take him up in flesh I don't
[19:03] believe because he said it was
[19:05] immediately I was in the spirit so God
[19:08] took him maybe like he did brother Brown
[19:10] in a vision or cooking over into another
[19:12] dimension and let him watch the stain of
[19:15] what was going to happen and you say
[19:17] well that's impossible
[19:18] how do you think Moses wrote the first
[19:20] five books of the Bible when he wasn't
[19:22] there basically almost the first two he
[19:26] was not there in the book of Genesis the
[19:28] whole Genesis was written from Moses
[19:31] watching television it was a vision yeah
[19:37] I believe I'm justice I believe that
[19:39] even when brother Brown my belief when
[19:41] he was discerning those people you watch
[19:42] you heat in that film he's never looked
[19:44] at them eyeball to eyeball he's looking
[19:46] off to the side he's watching the screen
[19:48] pop up and God shows him these people in
[19:52] their blue suit that comes to 245 he
[19:57] actually sees the guy doing this in his
[19:59] 2 4 or 5 Mulberry Street so he's seen
[20:02] the vision he see him but you remember a
[20:05] lot of things were the past we can deal
[20:07] with that the law that was in the future
[20:10] so we know it had to be God
[20:12] god only knows the future and he don't
[20:15] right
[20:16] so God was giving him a projection or a
[20:19] revelation what he saying by the way we
[20:22] gotta have that same thing maybe not a
[20:23] television screen opened up but we have
[20:25] a prophet come a porter a gamekeeper my
[20:30] doorkeeper and he opened the door and he
[20:33] not only went in and come out and told
[20:35] us what was going on we get to go in
[20:38] yes okay if not then we program left
[20:41] worked up we're done we're waiting on
[20:43] another Porter to stand in that no open
[20:47] in heaven
[20:49] brother Brown gave us the most updated
[20:53] heavenly revelation of anybody on earth
[20:56] except Jesus and they hardly understood
[20:58] him I call him a devil I called him all
[21:02] kind of different thing that's what's
[21:05] special about our day God send us a
[21:07] prophet that he could go up in the
[21:10] spirit and see these things as the eagle
[21:12] he could see these things and come tell
[21:15] us about that's it I like what brother
[21:19] Klaus Weisinger says you know brother
[21:21] Browns tells you many many times he said
[21:22] I just can't keep a secret I just can't
[21:24] keep a secret
[21:25] thank God he can't keep a secret that's
[21:28] my brother Brown that's why I got put
[21:29] brother Graham on the earth and giving
[21:30] the revelation so it went he went
[21:32] keeping the secret he tell it to us all
[21:35] right
[21:36] just like typing Abraham because why did
[21:39] they were hell mighty God go to Abraham
[21:41] somebody ready the other night because
[21:44] he knew that Abraham would tell his
[21:47] generation that will tell the next
[21:49] generation that because remember they
[21:51] didn't help cell phones iPads and they
[21:56] wrote they literally had to speak to the
[21:59] next generation and they would write it
[22:01] down or or would tell the story and they
[22:05] had to be highly accurate because how
[22:06] many times of you and I heard a story
[22:08] that became third person and fourth
[22:10] person and there was a little part left
[22:11] down right our attitude under the crest
[22:15] so you can't add in the word I take away
[22:18] from the words I think right so they had
[22:21] to be so that's why Moses I believe God
[22:23] just didn't speak to Moses I believe he
[22:25] showed him what happened in the garden
[22:26] he showed him what happened in Abraham's
[22:29] life
[22:29] he showed Moses his own death he got off
[22:33] Moses wrote I'm dying he's on death
[22:36] connie wrote the first five books in the
[22:38] Bible so
[22:40] it to me you ought to be so humble that
[22:46] you can that we can sit in there talk
[22:48] about if not just makes that enough here
[22:49] but all of us can see not see but and
[22:53] understand when somebody says something
[22:54] I was in the spirit you go no no we know
[22:59] exactly what happened
[23:00] God took him up in Revelation and showed
[23:04] him things to come right and behold a
[23:07] throne was set in heaven and one sat on
[23:09] the throne he the steps look like a
[23:10] desperate
[23:11] we never go get paying for the
[23:12] revelation and there was a rainbow about
[23:17] the throne and in sight like unto an
[23:19] emerald a brother Graham called that
[23:21] emerald light remember mm-hmm and round
[23:25] about the throne were more in 20 seats
[23:27] and upon these seats I saw four and
[23:30] twenty elders now what are the four and
[23:32] twenty elders recovering it's like we
[23:33] covered again twelve patriarchs in the
[23:37] Old Testament if I got that and twelve
[23:41] apostles in the New Testament
[23:42] so John had to see yourself sitting
[23:45] there but remember is in a vision okay
[23:49] that's alright
[23:50] so can't see yourself in a vision
[23:52] brother I'm so I self in the video all
[23:55] right all right go around about the
[23:56] throne were four twenty states and upon
[23:58] the seats I saw four and 20 elders
[24:00] sitting clothed in white raiment know
[24:02] where they were all at all
[24:04] I had a holy go he's a binman Old
[24:07] Testament yeah they're giving the Holy
[24:08] Ghost about this time they got it
[24:10] nothing here how you gonna happy gonna
[24:14] get them where they're at without
[24:17] imparting the Holy Ghost to them if I
[24:19] got that never okay with that okay you
[24:22] got to be careful you cuz see you Monica
[24:24] go back say well then gift about this
[24:26] behold ago no now he related you notice
[24:30] I didn't say me birth either I said the
[24:33] baptism of the Holy go kalenna John the
[24:35] man has got the baptism the Holy Ghost
[24:37] but he didn't get from your birth go
[24:40] backstage
[24:42] no one until Jesus died could have an
[24:45] indwelling of the new birth no one not
[24:51] even Adam Adam was imparted right Adam
[24:56] was in part of the eternal life
[24:58] he didn't receive the new birth no one
[25:00] in the Old Testament
[25:01] you can't give somebody the new birth
[25:03] when you got bulls and goats and all
[25:06] these animals you gotta sacrifice all it
[25:08] done was covered sin until Christ come
[25:11] the Passover we're going to talk about
[25:13] today's the Passover lamb so so these
[25:16] you said all the great apron oh yeah
[25:18] watch my brother prime say the Prophet
[25:20] brother around of many many times he
[25:21] said see what these people did without
[25:23] the baptism of Holy go right in the Old
[25:27] Testament that's what should make us
[25:28] ashamed it's because we got it inside of
[25:30] us they had an indwelling them on their
[25:34] spirit realm after so long in the spirit
[25:36] realm to anoint them to do David but
[25:40] look at them although they all had a
[25:41] flaw somewhere that you and I wouldn't
[25:44] have that flaw David wouldn't had the
[25:46] flaw of watching Bathsheba take a bath
[25:48] because brother Graham said then the
[25:50] Holy Ghost would make you turn away from
[25:51] a naked woman see but he didn't have
[25:54] that indwelling and that desire was
[25:56] still there so he took Bathsheba so that
[25:59] proved he did have them you learn then
[26:02] you birth changes from all that this
[26:03] okay am i okay with that only until they
[26:08] 120 in the upper room was there an
[26:10] indwelling of the Holy Ghost
[26:12] except for Adam who was in part of
[26:15] eternal life as a full-grown man
[26:18] not as a baby memory didn't grow as a
[26:20] baby he repeat he came here as a
[26:22] full-grown man right so I want to make
[26:25] that I want to make that point but now
[26:29] here there sitting what did the Holy
[26:32] Ghost but they're not bright now the 12
[26:36] the plots of law but the 12 apostles top
[26:39] the bride with 12 patriarchs got the Old
[26:41] Testament saying if I got that
[26:44] 12:12 and they're sitting here now
[26:47] remember this is a scene in heaven
[26:50] because literally they are somewhere
[26:53] right now literally they're all
[26:56] somewhere but they're not sitting
[26:58] together yet okay now brother Graham did
[27:05] see him on the sixth dimension either he
[27:07] saw his people so we got dimensions
[27:10] inside of dimension okay around about
[27:13] the throne were four and 20 seats for 20
[27:15] elders sitting clothed in white raiment
[27:17] and they had on their heads crowns of
[27:20] gold they had come to the position they
[27:21] come to a place and we need to go we
[27:25] need to go and now the throne feel I
[27:27] have done voices of seven well we'll get
[27:29] you that right there like we did like
[27:31] sleep we'll try to get to latinum no
[27:34] mistakes let's go we try and get out of
