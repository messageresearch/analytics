[0:00] your brother not for stepping in amen so
[0:03] this morning we want to we want to see
[0:06] where this stop is gonna lead us you
[0:10] know we look at the at the Bible and we
[0:12] see the kingdom of God the kingdom of
[0:14] heaven in handy yeah I see much okay
[0:21] right yeah the kingdom of God the
[0:24] kingdom of heaven we see that it says
[0:26] that in the scriptures it also calls it
[0:28] the kingdom that's right but what is the
[0:30] kingdom of God what is the kingdom of
[0:33] heaven so we want to take this month and
[0:35] kind of look a little bit in depth as to
[0:38] what the kingdom is maybe look at this
[0:42] and then on the third Sunday maybe look
[0:44] at something else just kind of take a
[0:46] little break and then the last Sunday
[0:48] we'll finish it up but we'll see how the
[0:50] Lord leads so all right so the phrase
[0:58] the kingdom of God it started to be used
[1:01] at the time of John the Baptist coming
[1:04] now we know in the Old Testament you
[1:06] know it talks about the kingdom and
[1:08] that's something later on in Daniel
[1:11] where the Daniel 7 and but we'll look at
[1:17] that later but this process when it
[1:21] started being used it was in the in the
[1:24] New Testament even where the phrase was
[1:26] used interchangeably with the phrases
[1:28] the Kingdom of Heaven or the kingdom
[1:30] amen referring to the same thing they
[1:33] meant the kingdom of God it was first
[1:38] used in Matthew chapter 3 verse 2 and
[1:42] this is the scripture here says in those
[1:45] days Came John the Baptist preaching in
[1:47] the wilderness of Judea verse 2 and
[1:51] saying repent ye for the kingdom of
[1:53] heaven is at hand
[1:55] in other words the God's God's Word
[2:00] amen was coming at him they measured the
[2:04] the fullness of God's work amen praise
[2:07] God at that Amen was at him amen and so
[2:14] John was preaching this already of
[2:17] course if we know it was a revelation to
[2:19] him I believe it was a revelation to him
[2:21] right because it was God who revealed to
[2:24] to John the - John - John and behold the
[2:28] lamb of God cometh they taketh away the
[2:30] sin of the world
[2:31] amen hmm and in Matthew 4:17
[2:36] Jesus says from that or the Bosma
[2:39] scripture says from that time Jesus
[2:40] began to preach and to say repent for
[2:44] the kingdom of heaven is at hand
[2:46] amen praise God so we see those those
[2:51] there now when you look at that word
[2:52] kingdom in the scripture in the
[2:54] scripture when you look at at the what
[2:59] is Strong's Concordance in the Greek
[3:01] it's the word of Basile Ava and it means
[3:05] kingdom of God kingdom of heaven Kingdom
[3:08] General or evil guy or than Kingdom his
[3:11] kingdom look at this one royal power
[3:14] kingship Dominion rule not to be
[3:18] confused with an actual Kingdom but
[3:20] rather the right or authority to rule
[3:23] over a kingdom now think about that they
[3:27] meant because Jesus they come here to
[3:30] establish the physical Kingdom amen and
[3:33] we're gonna read we have time we're
[3:35] gonna read something here in just a
[3:36] moment when he was talking to Pilate
[3:38] amen he didn't come here to establish
[3:41] but there were people the Jews were
[3:43] waiting for a messiah to come to
[3:45] establish a physical King that's right
[3:47] they were waiting for somebody like
[3:49] brother Brad said waiting for somebody
[3:51] to come and stomp out the Romans and and
[3:54] and for political for the Jews to be a
[3:58] great again politically and for the days
[4:00] of Solomon to return say the days of
[4:03] Solomon work
[4:04] and the Jews who were wanting that back
[4:07] and they thought that they would get it
[4:08] through the Messiah that this the
[4:10] Messiah was supposed to come that way
[4:11] but we know he came a totally different
[4:14] way and I like that's how God that's how
[4:17] God works he totally bamboozles us with
[4:20] the way he does things right you think
[4:24] that God is this goal is working one way
[4:26] and really he's doing it the another way
[4:28] not sure but it comes out perfect all
[4:30] the time
[4:31] amen but he had to be born in a manger a
[4:35] man matter he had he had to be a dentist
[4:39] that doesn't collect it too keen but he
[4:42] had to be born in a manger
[4:46] so was that it wasn't it wasn't I mean
[4:49] they felt that he was gonna come down to
[4:51] quarters down to kfs the high priests
[4:54] come down and and established it just
[4:57] sit on a throne you know just kind of
[5:00] sit and start ruling but that's not how
[5:04] you can you know sometimes you know we
[5:06] think should do things a certain way
[5:09] or that's something that we see that's
[5:11] going on it's happening because of this
[5:14] and in actuality then it turns out a
[5:17] good example is blast last year was the
[5:21] last year when we had the elections yes
[5:24] not two years ago four years ago well
[5:26] everybody thought Hillary Clinton was
[5:28] going to get in but three-quarters of
[5:30] the people in the message thought that
[5:32] that Hillary Clinton was going to get in
[5:34] to fulfill that prophecy that or that
[5:36] that what brother Brennan said there's
[5:38] got to be a you know a woman in the
[5:40] White House or on that bed and Hillary
[5:43] Clinton ain't getting a dress bride I'm
[5:45] sure so many a lot of people left the
[5:46] message because of that
[5:49] all right you know all right the same
[5:52] thing with 1900
[5:54] same thing with 1977 brother branham
[5:56] brother Brandon clearly said you know I
[5:58] don't prophesied that this is to come
[6:00] out of the Lord
[6:01] you're not just predict that the coming
[6:03] of the Lord things are looking so bleak
[6:04] and so dark and looking so dark by then
[6:07] that I the coming of the Lord you know
[6:10] could be eminent by that you know yes
[6:12] but when the things then happened
[6:14] exactly the way they thought it was
[6:15] gonna happen a lot of people took down
[6:18] and I heard I was I'm glad it didn't
[6:21] happen that time cuz 3 years laters when
[6:23] I was going to be born my mom and dad
[6:26] were just getting married in 1977 yeah
[6:31] you know so I had to come here to be
[6:33] expressed see just like you know we were
[6:37] talking last night and you know the Lamb
[6:40] of God was slain before the foundation
[6:43] of the world right he had to face him
[6:45] but but even though that took place in
[6:47] the mind of God it then actually
[6:49] happened there in heaven you know he'd
[6:52] even physically bleed no you know he had
[6:55] to come down down to earth to release
[6:59] his life just as we had to come down to
[7:02] earth so that we can receive that life
[7:04] I'm seeing and so I had to come down
[7:05] here to earth in 1980 to receive the
[7:10] later on machine right clutter I didn't
[7:12] come to the message until 1999 but I
[7:15] wanted to remove the 7 church ages of
[7:18] denominations before that time of living
[7:20] I bet I've been through different
[7:22] churches if you don't know I've been
[7:24] Catholic
[7:25] I've been Baptist I've been Wesleyan
[7:27] back to the Baptist Pentecostal and then
[7:30] message and that's the full word right
[7:33] there yeah I stay with that it's not
[7:37] with the denomination I stay with the
[7:38] word I praise God some people may say
[7:42] well you're just a you're just a church
[7:44] hopper you know but we call my mom and
[7:47] dad Church hopper but not me because I
[7:49] was living with them at the time but you
[7:51] know what my mom and dad
[7:52] Laure they love this message and it was
[7:55] God just leading them through you know
[7:57] it was just the Lord just they wanted
[8:00] something more even drug believe I'm
[8:03] sorry you were drugged I was drugged you
[8:05] were drugged you were gurgling water
[8:09] yeah and you know in between there you
[8:13] know you you get those that teenage
[8:15] spirit you start getting rebellion
[8:17] essential in the Baptist Church and but
[8:20] you know when God is dealing with you
[8:21] because listen st. John I don't know I'm
[8:24] going this way but all right go ahead
[8:25] but don't name them absolutely and and
[8:31] when I was when I was nine ten years old
[8:34] when we were when we were at the idea
[8:38] with the Jehovah's Witness I would sit
[8:41] there and read their literature at nine
[8:44] ten years old my mom and dad would never
[8:47] asked me to sit down and read their
[8:49] books you know or or their Watchtower
[8:51] magazine I would just go pick up pick up
[8:54] a book and start reading on my own not
[8:56] and it was because there was something
[8:58] in me that wanted to know more about God
[9:00] you know they wanted more and that was
[9:03] the only thing that I had at the time so
[9:06] then that you know just kind of started
[9:08] growing but it's God leading you short
[9:10] I'm a madman so this is not a physical
[9:13] Kingdom it's it's not to be confused
[9:16] with a natural Kingdom but rather the
[9:18] right or authority to rule over a
[9:20] kingdom amen praise God now I want us to
[9:24] read Matthew chapter 6 and listen we're
[9:27] gonna take our time even we got a whole
[9:29] month and so we're gonna just read the
[9:32] scriptures and kind of dissect things as
[9:35] uh you know I believe that it's good for
[9:38] us to do that sometimes it we might get
[9:40] a little because the title is is it
[9:43] internal or is it external but you might
[9:45] get a little carnal you know talk about
[9:48] some some some things because sometimes
[9:51] you know we we talk about you know the
[9:54] great things of God and
[9:57] it's very important you know brother
[9:59] weights bringing out the seals but
[10:01] they'll talking about salvation then you
[10:03] birth and all these things but sometimes
[10:05] there's people that have questions in
[10:08] their mind about external things
[10:10] happening in their life that they can't
[10:12] they can't they don't if you don't if
[10:15] you're not there to help them they're
[10:18] just as good I mean Paul talked about
[10:19] these things you see and we're gonna
[10:21] read later on something that that is
[10:24] very very important Paul had to deal
[10:26] with these things with the Corinthians
[10:28] with neuro medicines and so on
[10:30] it affects our life and it's very
[10:31] important for our lives amen so Matthew
[10:38] chapter 6 verse 25 therefore I say unto
[10:40] you take no thought for your life what
[10:42] you shall eat or what ye shall drink nor
[10:46] yet for your body what ye shall put on
[10:48] it's not the life more than meat and the
[10:51] body than raiment so here Jesus is
[10:55] dealing with it says take no thought for
[10:59] your life with the were eNOS that we get
[11:02] sometimes in life about what am I gonna
[11:05] wear what am I gonna wear where am I
[11:07] gonna eat what am I gonna wear am I
[11:09] gonna sleep or where am i what am I
[11:10] gonna do about this bill what am I gonna
[11:12] do about that
[11:13] he said take no thought about it in
[11:15] other words he didn't say don't think
[11:17] about it cuz you have to pay your bills
[11:19] you realize a month later that you can
[11:22] pay your bills again when the power gets
[11:25] cut off but he said don't worry about it
[11:29] don't consume yourself in those things
[11:32] so many people get so concerned with
[11:34] different areas in their life and forget
[11:37] that there's a god that is in complete
[11:39] control
[11:40] you know when I was when I was several
[11:43] years back my wife and testify about
[11:46] this I was so consumed with conspiracy
[11:49] theories and I would get in conspiracy
[11:52] theories and I would you know and and
[11:55] and I was consumed by that and then one
[11:58] day I realized wait a second this is
[12:00] taking me away from the Word of God
[12:02] no matter how true they could be or no
[12:05] matter how how no matter what happened I
[12:09] realized that uh everything that takes
[12:11] place around the world is because God
[12:13] just wants to fulfill his word and it's
[12:16] preparing and the bride is really
[12:17] prepared amen
[12:19] no matter who did what or what it
[12:21] doesn't matter and some people get so
[12:23] consumed by that enough and I preached
[12:25] at a church one time in South Carolina
[12:27] and a sister came up to me afterwards
[12:30] and I mentioned something like that and
[12:32] the sister came up to me and said I
[12:34] started talking about how the government
[12:36] in the area and how it was some sort of
[12:39] conspiracy about the water supply and
[12:42] all this kind of stuff that's that
[12:43] sister you know why why do you consume
[12:47] yourself by that do you realize that if
[12:49] everything that needs to happen happens
[12:51] in order to fulfill the Word of God he
[12:53] said look at it that way because Satan
[12:57] is anointing man right her to do things
[13:01] but it's but if you go brother Graham
[13:03] said that Satan is a tool in the hands
[13:05] of God
[13:05] so whatever God has to do it you know
[13:08] you know let's just let's consume
[13:10] ourselves into work yeah man
[13:11] that's where we need to consume
[13:13] ourselves with no nor yet for your body
[13:15] one day ye shall put on it's not life
[13:18] more than meat and the body than raiment
[13:20] so your life is more than these external
[13:23] things behold the fowls of the air for
[13:25] they sow not neither do they reap nor
[13:27] gather into barns yet your heavenly
[13:29] Father feedeth them are ye not much
[13:31] better than this right which of you by
[13:35] taking thought can add one cubit unto
[13:37] his stature how many would like that
[13:41] I'm sure the tall people wouldn't care
[13:45] too much about that and why take ye
[13:49] thought for raiment why do you worry
[13:52] about raiment or clothing consider the
[13:55] lilies of the field how they grow they
[13:58] don't they don't tall neither do they
[14:01] spin in other words they don't they're
[14:03] not moving around they're not working
[14:04] and yea I say unto you that even Solomon
[14:07] in all his glory was not arrayed like
[14:09] one of these women never think about
[14:12] that you know because Solomon he was the
[14:14] bridge probably the richest man that
[14:16] ever lived
[14:16] why is this man that ever lived probably
[14:19] had everything the most beautiful
[14:20] clothes that Kara had but he was not
[14:22] even clothes like these these these
[14:26] flowers and things you know that we see
[14:28] out here nature that sometimes we just
[14:29] just step on firemen don't even think
[14:32] about him one time that God was the one
[14:34] who gave who gave the increase
[14:37] wherefore if God so clothes the grass of
[14:40] the field which today is and tomorrow is
[14:42] cast into the oven shall he not much
[14:44] more clothe you in other words if he
[14:46] clothes though the flowers the grass out
[14:49] in the field if he gives him their color
[14:51] he does all these things because all
[14:52] those all those things are complex what
[14:55] happens is nature in nature is complex
[14:57] but yet God is in control of all these
[15:00] statement how much more will he me am
[15:02] not able to provide especially for his
[15:04] children even Radice man therefore take
[15:07] no Thought saying what shall we eat what
[15:09] shall we drink or wherewithal shall we
[15:11] be clothed for after all these things do
[15:14] the Gentiles see now we are all Gentiles
[15:17] so we are prone to doing this then Jesus
[15:22] says except for after all these things
[15:24] do the Gentiles seek or in other words
[15:26] there they get consumed by all these
[15:29] things so I gotta work I gotta I gotta
[15:31] make money I got to do all these things
[15:33] I gotta because if I don't do it then it
[15:35] won't be done
[15:38] take a deep breath breathe deeply and
[15:42] say 3 2 1 1 2 3 what in the world is
[15:47] bothering me 3 2 1 1 2 3 what the heck
[15:57] is bothering me
[16:07] [Laughter]
[16:13] so 1 1 I used to watch TV
[16:15] yeah for your heavenly Father knoweth
[16:19] that ye have need of all these things
[16:21] you see you know is that you have better
[16:24] things so why in the world worry
[16:27] I don't know between my wife and me I
[16:31] think maybe she might tend to be a
[16:34] little bit more she gets it from her dad
[16:36] she and she tends to be the more of the
[16:38] worrier you know and I just I just like
[16:43] listen it'll get taken care of somehow
[16:47] but at the same time she's learned that
[16:49] part from me you know to not worry but
[16:51] at the same time I learned from her that
[16:54] things do need to get taken care of at
[16:56] times if not the ceiling will fall on
[17:00] your head and the termites will eat your
[17:02] house which happened to me in Anderson
[17:04] South Carolina and and I thought ah it's
[17:08] fine it's just sagging a little bit but
[17:10] it's no problem
[17:11] termites were eating that whole corner
[17:13] up so sometimes you can be too calm
[17:19] you see yeah there has to be a balance
[17:22] God is a God of balance but seek ye
[17:25] first the kingdom of God the man you
[17:29] seek seek ye first the kingdom of God in
[17:33] every single thing that you do or about
[17:37] to do ask ask the Lord about it
[17:39] ask him Lord is this part of your
[17:42] kingdom
[17:43] right is this what you is this is this
[17:48] is this in your word does this agree
[17:51] with your working as a team and his
[17:53] righteousness and all these things shall
[17:56] be added unto you now look what Jesus
[17:58] says it's not that uh none of these
[18:01] things are bad you need to have clothes
[18:04] you need to have a food you need to have
[18:07] all these things it's nice to be able to
[18:09] drive a nice car and these things right
[18:12] sure but when you seek the kingdom of
[18:15] God first then all these things will be
[18:17] added unto you right now it's not saying
[18:20] no God knows what you can hand on what
[18:23] you can't handle there are some people
[18:26] that can't handle money and God won't
[18:28] bless them with money and there they're
[18:30] working their life in there and they're
[18:32] peddling and striving and they seem like
[18:36] they never get where they really want to
[18:39] get but it's because God knows you
[18:41] better than you know yourself god bless
[18:43] you brother brother
[18:53] [Music]
[18:55] God knows you God knows you in your
[18:59] heart better than you know yourself
[19:01] that's right now there's not a lot of
[19:03] Christian people that are wealthy now I
[19:07] wonder why you know we all work we all
[19:11] make money we all but why is it there
[19:14] some of them some of some of us just a
[19:17] few or actually have well I honestly
[19:21] believe that God really knows that they
[19:24] can handle that can handle the money you
[19:27] know and they know what well I didn't
[19:28] the money won't handle them right they
[19:30] know how to handle the money you see so
[19:34] and they know that they can be a
[19:36] blessing to the bride into the ministry
[19:38] around the world with that money there
[19:40] you know and all these things shall be
[19:44] added unto you take therefore no thought
[19:46] for tomorrow for the morrow shall take
[19:48] thought for the things of itself
[19:50] sufficient unto the day is the evil
[19:53] thereof can somebody tell me what that
[19:55] last part means sufficient unto the day
[19:58] is the evil thereof who don't get a
[20:01] little class participation but I want to
[20:03] I want somebody to tell me what that
[20:04] means
[20:06] sufficient unto the day is the evil
[20:08] thereof nobody
[20:15] [Laughter]
[20:19] it means that what we go through in that
[20:23] day is already enough this right the
[20:26] hardships of that day is already enough
[20:28] for you to have to worry about these
[20:30] other statements and Truong insane so
[20:33] you you've bothered end of the day you
[20:35] know us that we're getting older and
[20:37] just a Peggy I'm sure you feel this
[20:40] by the end of the day you've already
[20:42] probably you're ready just go to sleep
[20:54] there isn't they still all right so
[20:57] nobly you have to know she's still about
[21:00] twenty year old but you know why consume
[21:12] yourself above these things when you
[21:14] already have so much troubles going on
[21:16] especially if you still have kids living
[21:17] in the house you know you got the run
[21:22] here run there with them go here and do
[21:25] this and yell at one for a little while
[21:27] and not necessarily yell at one but
[21:31] sometimes you have to raise your voice
[22:05] up now she said I should have beat you
[22:14] okay boy all right
[22:16] point all right let's continue so
[22:22] brother Branham says in the Smyrna
[22:24] Church age he says here is where you
[22:28] have to believe again in the love and
[22:30] goodness and wisdom of God this too is
[22:32] need for remember he admonished take no
[22:35] thought for tomorrow what you shall eat
[22:37] or what ye shall put on your father
[22:40] knoweth the things you have need of he
[22:43] who clothes the lily and feeds the
[22:45] sparrow shall be much more for you these
[22:48] physical things are not the true basic
[22:50] necessities of your life for a man's
[22:53] life consisteth none of the things he
[22:55] possesses but rather seek ye first the
[22:58] kingdom of God and His righteousness and
[22:59] all material necessities will be added
[23:03] unto you the people of God are not
[23:05] material minded they are Christ minded
[23:10] they do not seek the treasures that are
[23:12] below they seek those above it is
[23:16] absolutely true the majority of
[23:18] Christians are not wealthy rather they
[23:21] are on the poor side it was so in Jesus
[23:24] day it was true and Paul's what in
[23:27] Paul's day and it should be true today
[23:30] now brother Branham is not saying that
[23:32] it's bad for you to have money now but
[23:35] it's just that's just uh
[23:37] things because I'm saying the majority
[23:38] of us do not know how to handle money
[23:40] that we let money handle us
[23:42] oh oh it's not it's not true today for
[23:48] the latest series for the Laodicean age
[23:50] is one of vast wealth where often the
[23:54] criterion of spirituality is an
[23:56] abundance of earthly Goods that's how
[23:59] that's the mentality of Laodicea today
[24:01] and a lot of people today have a such
[24:06] great opportunity to have more money
[24:08] today especially after the internet came
[24:11] out you can make you can make butchers
[24:13] of money off the internet
[24:15] Lucy and so as given layer Asiya an
[24:19] opportunity to have more money more
[24:21] thing to to fulfill this you know I know
[24:25] a lot of the olders older generation you
[24:29] know they the mentality was I go to a
[24:32] job I work eight hours 12 hours a day I
[24:35] not retired you know I work 40 35 40
[24:38] years but the mentality now free younger
[24:41] generation is totally fit our family you
[24:44] know they were there they want money
[24:47] working for them and instead of them
[24:49] working for money and that opportunity
[24:52] is out there see and so that's the
[24:54] reason why I believe that's the reason
[24:56] why Lee Rossio has you know they have
[24:59] money and earthly things but that
[25:02] doesn't mean they have got my how rich
[25:07] the churches and goods but how poor in
[25:09] spirit blessed blessed be he poor for
[25:13] yours is the kingdom of God the kingdom
[25:15] of God is not meat and drink it's not
[25:17] material it is within us a rich man is
[25:20] reaching God not inwardly thing there
[25:23] praise the Lord David and I started with
[25:27] this point about seeking the seeking
[25:29] first the kingdom of God because as we
[25:31] talk about this kingdom amen we need to
[25:34] seek the kingdom of God first look this
[25:36] is the first and foremost thing thank
[25:38] you
[25:38] so that's where that's the reason why
[25:41] now in Luke 18 says verse 28 then Peter
[25:47] said lo we have left all and followed
[25:49] thee speaking to Jesus and Jesus replies
[25:53] and says and he said unto them verily I
[25:55] say unto you there is no man that hath
[25:57] left house parents or parents or
[25:59] brethren or wife or children for the
[26:02] kingdom of God's sake who shall not
[26:04] receive manifold more in this present
[26:07] time and in the world to come life ever
[26:11] lasts mmm so when you give a sacrifice
[26:16] when you sacrifice of yourself when you
[26:19] sacrifice even your own family to obtain
[26:22] this kingdom yes amen
[26:24] there's there's a blessing for that
[26:29] there's been a lot there's been a lot of
[26:32] people a lot of Christians would have
[26:34] done that and God has restored you know
[26:37] families and things like that and then
[26:40] he does the miraculous when you when you
[26:42] let them do the miraculous events but
[26:45] when you sometimes they're not just
[26:48] speak it personally you see sometimes we
[26:52] kind of let the importance of spending
[26:55] time with your children the importance
[26:57] of spending time with your with your
[26:59] wife with your husband and the important
[27:01] it's so important but yet when that time
[27:05] is gonna sacrifice your time with God or
[27:08] your time to be a church or your time or
[27:11] your time to read the word or pray you
[27:14] know whatever that is a hindrance to you
[27:17] spiritually safely and so we need to we
[27:21] need to put those things in priority I
[27:23] love my wife I love my children but I
[27:26] have in the past
[27:27] I have let my time with God be
[27:31] sacrificed in order to dispense um any
[27:33] timing with with my children or spend
[27:35] some time and then I realized right a
[27:37] second that shouldn't have happened
[27:39] you see I think maybe we should have
[27:40] just all spent time with the Lord and it
[27:44] would have been better but though so
[27:47] nothing my wife pulls me or anything
[27:50] like that yeah this is a honey I'm gonna
[27:52] go pregnant pray me to come here and
[27:54] talk to me a massage you know she
[27:57] doesn't do that it's not that she does
[28:05] that but sometimes you have it in your
[28:07] mind I want to go do this I want to sit
[28:10] down and read and then something just
[28:11] kind of just pulls you away yeah let me
[28:14] tell you you regret it
[28:16] then I feel bad why because you you were
[28:20] not seeking the kingdom something else
[28:22] was dragging amen praise God now so it's
[28:27] the kingdom of God external what the
[28:29] kingdom of is not John six then those
[28:33] men verse 14 that does man when they had
[28:36] seen the miracle that Jesus did said
[28:38] this is of a truth that prophet that
[28:41] should come into the world when Jesus
[28:43] therefore perceived that they would come
[28:45] and take him by force to make him a king
[28:48] he departed again into a mountain
[28:51] himself alone so here we see example of
[28:55] the Jews thinking having that mentality
[28:58] they wanted a physical Kingdom that's
[29:00] what they thought the Messiah was going
[29:02] to come in and set a physical Kingdom
[29:04] and stop the Romans and take us back to
[29:07] the golden days of Solomon but Jesus
[29:10] that wasn't his mentality that's not
[29:12] what he came here for and he departed in
[29:15] other words he got away from that they
[29:16] were gonna make him a king I don't know
[29:18] how the details as to as to as to that
[29:21] but they wanted to make him a king so
[29:24] they realized he was an important person
[29:26] maybe some of those they thought he this
[29:29] is the Messiah
[29:30] gonna be the king no but that's not what
[29:34] he came in another example Luke chapter
[29:38] 19 for the Son of man has come to seek
[29:40] and to save that which was lost
[29:42] verse 11 and as they heard these things
[29:45] he added and spake a parable because he
[29:48] was 9 to Jerusalem and because they
[29:50] thought that the kingdom of God should
[29:51] immediately appear so they thought that
[29:55] the kingdom of God should immediately a
[29:57] physical Kingdom should immediately
[29:58] appear now joseph of arimathea in mark
[30:01] chapter 15 i put question marks here
[30:05] because i get i don't know you could go
[30:07] both ways I'm not sure brother brother
[30:09] wait but he was that he was a Jew and it
[30:12] says Joseph of Arimathea an honourable
[30:15] counsellor which also waited for the
[30:17] kingdom of God came and went in boldly
[30:20] unto Pilate and craved the body of Jesus
[30:22] joseph of arimathea us that's the tomb
[30:24] that it was Joseph's that's what he says
[30:27] was buried let's see me take it both
[30:30] ways I guess maybe he was seeking the
[30:31] real thing you know with the spiritual
[30:33] aspect of the kingdom but being a Jew he
[30:36] could also be thinking the same thing as
[30:38] well you know physical Kingdom the
[30:39] established and all that so and in two
[30:44] more scriptures Luke chapter 17 verse 20
[30:47] and when he was demanded of the
[30:48] Pharisees when the kingdom of God should
[30:50] come so the Pharisees come to Jesus and
[30:52] ask him when is the kingdom of God
[30:54] supposed to be established and looking
[30:57] for a physical Kingdom not looking at
[30:58] anything spiritual right he answered
[31:01] them and said the kingdom of God cometh
[31:03] not with observation now what does that
[31:06] mean that the kingdom of God comes
[31:09] without observation the kingdom of God
[31:12] is this is being established it's being
[31:16] established even now and people have no
[31:18] idea that it's being stubbs because why
[31:21] the kingdom of God is a spiritual
[31:23] Kingdom
[31:25] you are the kingdom
[31:28] right the kingdom of God dwells within
[31:30] let me see
[31:31] amen it's a spiritual Kingdom and nobody
[31:34] will know anything about it hmm
[31:37] that's what I was talking to uh I think
[31:39] I think it was brother Joe and you know
[31:44] we were discussing how how things are
[31:47] shaping up right now Billy Graham's
[31:50] death and and the things that are taking
[31:52] place around the world and and all these
[31:54] things and in Billy Graham's death and
[31:58] yet people just go on it's just like
[32:01] another preacher just just just died and
[32:03] they have no idea what the significance
[32:05] of that is do you know that that I don't
[32:07] know how if any of you watched the Billy
[32:11] Graham's funeral service the other day
[32:13] was lying
[32:15] one of his daughters gets up and speaks
[32:17] and I think she's a woman preacher yes
[32:20] she is okay but what she said was so
[32:23] interesting and she said she said my
[32:27] father's she said my father's death it's
[32:32] much more significant than his life was
[32:35] that's what she said she said she said
[32:39] um she said because I seek the kingdom
[32:47] first she said because she said no now
[32:55] listen to this because we know brother
[32:56] Branham he typed he typed Moses we know
[32:59] he typed Elisha he said because his life
[33:03] typed that of Moses is what she was
[33:07] saying
[33:07] right he was kind of like the Moses went
[33:10] off the scene but now Joshua was the one
[33:14] who took the children of Israel into the
[33:15] Promised Land right and and and then she
[33:20] goes now the name Joshua is the name it
[33:24] means Jesus right and it was Jesus the
[33:28] Holy Spirit that is to take the church
[33:30] in now this is this is this is a nominal
[33:33] woman talking this way I say
[33:35] so you know how she brings out that his
[33:39] death is much more so and president
[33:41] Trump is right there the vice president
[33:43] was right there and yeah
[33:47] type type yeah type of Billy Graham as
[33:49] Moses right did I say something else and
[33:56] I've seen that's the way around her
[33:58] famine they have we the understanding of
[34:00] the Prophet know that he was what he was
[34:02] given was but they put him in that
[34:03] position right it's kind of strange to
[34:05] her name blacks name blog is that her
[34:08] last night all right
[34:15] people sent this out of them call out
[34:19] what so let's do this so I thought that
[34:31] was very interesting stone a lot of
[34:33] people you know they have things going
[34:37] on around the world politically and have
[34:39] no idea what's not you know what's
[34:42] taking place
[34:42] mmm but blessed are your eyes for they
[34:45] see from the short lives yeah and your
[34:47] ears for the here in the same and it
[34:50] shouldn't alarm missus Karras that's
[34:52] right right
[34:53] it should just cause us to be me already
[34:55] you know know it's Louise yes brother
[34:59] Louise me sir call me Louis - but you
[35:03] know okay boy you guys here's a little
[35:07] more than historical perspective we do
[35:09] know John joking on the Baptist he was
[35:14] proclaiming repentance in the kingdom of
[35:16] God and all the Judea said was stirring
[35:20] so the only thing that you said they had
[35:24] in their thinking was okay
[35:27] Davis rain is gonna start again and
[35:29] they're they're hot were the one to do
[35:30] it and it's not like there weren't other
[35:33] people that were out there leading
[35:35] revolts against
[35:37] yeah already sure higher education a
[35:40] matter of fact there was one even though
[35:42] I think it was an Angels remember ones
[35:44] who may have said hey this if this comes
[35:46] of anything you better not fight called
[35:47] his dog cuz remember that other guy came
[35:49] and took four hundred down the desert
[35:51] and he disappeared
[35:52] yeah let him know now that was Jesus
[35:55] what the old one that that was me and he
[35:57] wasn't revolting the people around him
[35:59] forever
[36:00] yeah kind of like you know the Tim Jones
[36:02] of that car well they wanted the kingdom
[36:04] to come I mean they wanted to came out
[36:05] there they've been ruled by fresh by
[36:07] Robin for many years they wanted some
[36:11] release
[36:12] Ron when I finally found a man they
[36:14] think we're at least I know since the
[36:15] death of though oh absolutely were under
[36:18] the needs intrusion yeah then and then
[36:20] they were under the grease and together
[36:21] and that's all they've known as a
[36:23] physical Kingdom right and if it is
[36:26] promised right try the God that brought
[36:28] most took them out of the wilderness the
[36:30] holes of the heater that there was
[36:32] coming a time right but of the Torah
[36:35] they were like we talked all about they
[36:38] look at the Victorian someone's
[36:40] coming
[36:41] you know when somebody or they just dies
[36:44] like that the muffler's come in just
[36:46] like in Jesus name and the way that I
[36:48] was saying I hope he was in hell so like
[36:51] I say there's two Spears in the world
[37:00] spiritual things I guess we'll stop it
[37:03] right there no real good
[37:07] okay all right so uh and so this kingdom
[37:16] of God is not something that is
[37:18] observable right first 2117 neither
[37:23] shall they say lo here or lo there for
[37:25] behold the kingdom of God is within you
[37:29] nobody we will be able to point out well
[37:32] the head is the kingdom of God there is
[37:34] the kingdom of God
[37:35] no nobody doesn't know but you know if
[37:40] the Word of God is the new birth is the
[37:43] word Amen if you have the fever x1 when
[37:47] they therefore were come together they
[37:49] asked of him saying Lord will thou at
[37:51] this time restore again the kingdom to
[37:53] Israel this is their disciples speaking
[37:55] this is after Jesus resurrection so
[37:59] there look they're still seeking a
[38:01] physical Kingdom surely here and he said
[38:04] unto them it is not for you to know the
[38:06] times or the seasons now to me that
[38:08] seems like uh that that there will be
[38:11] something physical for the Jews that
[38:13] will be established at the Millennium no
[38:15] doubt right yes mm-hmm and we're gonna
[38:18] be part of it as well well who's gonna
[38:21] be sitting with them that's right right
[38:26] I'm not sure whether your statement
[38:28] worth what you're thinking your part is
[38:29] going to be in the millennial reign but
[38:32] we are going to be ruling and reigning
[38:33] with absolutely that's less SIA over the
[38:36] nation's not just over the nation's
[38:38] absolutely remember on the truck it's
[38:40] exactly so we don't know the time they
[38:45] didn't know the times or the seasons
[38:46] which the father hath put in his power
[38:49] right so he has he has control of all
[38:51] these things he knows but you shall
[38:53] receive power now look how Jesus turns
[38:55] it into the spiritual he said alright
[38:58] but you shall receive power after that
[39:01] the Holy Ghost is come upon you right
[39:03] and ye shall be witnesses unto me both
[39:06] in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in
[39:09] Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of
[39:11] the earth amen
[39:13] so again Jesus showing us that he was
[39:16] more concerned about because listen
[39:18] Saints if the kingdom of God if you
[39:20] can't if you can't possess your kingdom
[39:23] amen this kingdom here right now however
[39:26] in the where are you gonna reign there
[39:27] like you see we are we are called to be
[39:31] kings and priests right now in God's
[39:35] eyes and that's the reason why I believe
[39:37] that we need to start acting my kings we
[39:40] need to start acting like priests and
[39:43] we're gonna we're gonna talk about some
[39:45] other things Lord willing next Sunday
[39:48] I see
[39:52] to me that's the new birth absolutely
[39:56] she gotta remember if it was so built on
[39:59] buildings buildings walls temples
[40:02] they're looking for a physical Kingdom
[40:04] which they will get in the Millennium
[40:06] and they'll have a temple you know there
[40:07] but then Jesus kept saying no moving in
[40:12] and then when the Holy Ghost fell just a
[40:14] few days after that x1 they realized
[40:16] Peter and said okay this is what is that
[40:20] I remember - there you say love should
[40:37] be my watch want to belong to the sale
[40:39] we bought new ones will they're back
[40:41] there in the lab
