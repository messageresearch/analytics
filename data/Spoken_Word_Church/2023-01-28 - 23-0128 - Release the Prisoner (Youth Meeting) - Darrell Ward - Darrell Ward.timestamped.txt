[11:25] if anyone has an unannounced special
[11:28] you know don't be afraid to raise your
[11:29] hand at this time in any any other time
[11:33] I always want to hear it special
[11:35] but uh if not at this time I'd like to
[11:37] ask a sister Nelly to give her testimony
[11:39] the Nicaragua shirt
[11:54] God bless you Saints
[11:57] I'm sorry I'm really nervous
[12:00] um first I just want to start by
[12:03] thanking brother and sister Eureka for
[12:07] um arranging everything and taking care
[12:10] of all of us and being the best tour
[12:12] guides
[12:13] um I want to thank my parents mom and
[12:15] dad for allowing me to go
[12:19] um
[12:20] I'm sorry
[12:21] so as you know we were supposed to reach
[12:24] Managua Wednesday
[12:26] but we only got to Houston
[12:29] and um after we got out off the plane we
[12:34] went in this line to see if we can um
[12:36] get another flight basically for that
[12:38] day or if they could schedule another
[12:40] flight and everyone was just tired and
[12:43] hungry and just exhausted
[12:47] um
[12:48] I know and the lesson I really learned
[12:51] from that was just putting it into the
[12:53] Lord's hands because we were like you
[12:55] know if it's if it's not your will Lord
[12:57] we won't go
[13:00] um maybe brother Louise and brother Bob
[13:01] can go but everyone else would just you
[13:03] know go home but um I really learned to
[13:06] just you know pray about and just put
[13:08] into the Lord's hands and he just makes
[13:10] a way and um that was that was a that
[13:13] was a real blessing
[13:14] um we so we um
[13:17] we got a flight for Friday and there was
[13:19] exactly you know eight seats and there
[13:21] was eight people so you know that was a
[13:24] real miracle and I just want to thank
[13:25] the Lord for that
[13:27] um
[13:28] in Nicaragua what um my gist of it was
[13:31] you know from washing dishes by hand and
[13:35] um being in Believers homes that didn't
[13:37] you know had um dirt flooring or using
[13:41] outhouses
[13:42] all I could see was just the happiness
[13:45] in their eyes and their hearts and how
[13:48] serious they were about the Lord how
[13:50] content they were and I just wish that
[13:53] we could be more like that you know um
[13:56] to have very little and still put God
[13:58] above everything
[14:00] and um I just love being with them the
[14:04] atmosphere they're really sweet people
[14:07] they're just wonderful brothers and
[14:09] sisters and honestly when Christy and
[14:12] them go back I'm on the next flight back
[14:13] it was just a real blessing and um
[14:17] putting all of these things into
[14:18] perspective has just moved my heart
[14:20] closer to the Lord and I was very
[14:22] humbled by this experience so thank you
[14:24] all for praying with us praying for us
[14:26] it was just a real blessing thank you
[14:30] [Applause]
[14:36] amen
[14:38] I will now give my testimony of the trip
[14:41] um
[14:43] once again if anyone has a special
[14:44] they'll be afraid to raise your hand
[14:47] uh I actually I can start off with that
[14:49] that in Nicaragua almost every uh
[14:52] service we went to there was at least
[14:53] like four or five specials so
[14:55] maybe we could think about that
[14:58] and just feel free to come up but um I
[15:03] know I want to thank uh brother Louise
[15:06] Sister Christine for uh facilitating the
[15:09] whole trip you know allowing us to
[15:11] you know they know people and allowing
[15:13] us to go with them and for the church
[15:15] and all the donations and everything
[15:16] that really helped out with the trip
[15:19] Miss Percy once thought our flights got
[15:21] delayed and canceled and all that you
[15:24] know your money really kept us afloat
[15:26] that we were able to stay at a hotel you
[15:28] know and because God wanted us to go on
[15:30] this trip like in Central Iowa said
[15:31] there was only eight seats and sorry
[15:33] there was only eight seats
[15:36] and uh we were able to all eight of us
[15:38] were able to get on so like like
[15:39] shanella said that was really a miracle
[15:41] and God really wanted us to go right so
[15:45] so thank you for your donations uh
[15:48] everyone if your first language is
[15:50] English please raise your hand
[15:53] that's wonderful okay I think we should
[15:56] all thank God that our first language
[15:57] first language is English because this
[16:01] message came in English and we're all
[16:04] able to easily read it read the tapes
[16:06] read the books listen to the message and
[16:09] and in different parts of the country
[16:11] where the first language isn't English
[16:13] they need interpreters they need
[16:14] translators they need
[16:16] all these different we need many people
[16:18] from here to go over there who know both
[16:20] languages many people like maybe brother
[16:22] Bob who only knows one language but he
[16:24] can't just go by himself and he's
[16:25] someone like brother Louise and there's
[16:26] just so much more that there's so many
[16:28] more barriers that they have to go
[16:30] through to get to this message
[16:32] so we should just all be that grateful
[16:34] that we happen to speak English and that
[16:36] should happen to be our first thing we
[16:37] haven't been born in a English-speaking
[16:39] country where the message came in
[16:41] English and that's why brother Branham
[16:42] says that America is going to get a
[16:44] special you know punishment because we
[16:47] speak English the message came in
[16:48] English that we had an American prophet
[16:51] and and we have all this technology and
[16:53] all this all this access and information
[16:55] and we just don't use it right so we're
[16:57] going to get a special punishment if we
[16:58] don't grasp this word and really take
[17:00] hold of all the blessings that we've
[17:02] just been blessed with there's nothing
[17:03] of our own Merit we've just been born
[17:05] here and that's just it's incredible and
[17:08] we need to be thankful for that every
[17:09] day
[17:10] and also want to
[17:12] talk about just uh something this trip
[17:15] made me really grateful for is the
[17:17] progress that the missionary field has
[17:18] made in in all the years because it's
[17:21] just
[17:22] you know when that scripture says that
[17:24] you know spread the gospel to the utmost
[17:25] parts of the earth you know and we go to
[17:27] this this small little Island
[17:29] where I mean there's one message Church
[17:32] on the entire island people have dirt
[17:34] houses you know they're washing clothes
[17:36] by hand they're washing everything by
[17:37] hand they're doing everything by hand
[17:39] there's no they don't call a plumber
[17:41] they don't call a carpenter unless it's
[17:44] the guy around the around the street
[17:45] that they know that it works with wood
[17:47] but they they have so little and they're
[17:49] just so out of the way but the fact that
[17:51] we're able to get to them and minister
[17:53] to them and fellowship with them it's
[17:56] it's truly a blessing so the the just
[17:59] the progress that the missionary field
[18:00] has made and message analysis was saying
[18:02] they're all very friendly people even
[18:03] through the language barrier we're
[18:05] trying to understand them but they're a
[18:06] very happy smiling up ready to talk to
[18:09] you
[18:10] it's an incredible thing and and also
[18:13] the the progress of the missionary field
[18:15] is also my own personal testimony
[18:17] because you know a prophet one time went
[18:20] to Africa to do some
[18:22] some missionary work and that missionary
[18:24] work spread all the way to Zimbabwe
[18:26] where my method his grandfather had a
[18:29] firstborn daughter who could then meet
[18:31] someone who was in the message
[18:33] and then comes me who I can also be born
[18:36] to the message and born you know under
[18:38] under the right atmosphere to receive
[18:40] the message as well so that's just the
[18:42] progress of that and how how much it
[18:44] spread and that's why that's why
[18:46] we're called to spread the gospel we're
[18:48] called to you know whoever we run into
[18:50] we need to we need to try and get that
[18:51] word out and that's how we're gonna
[18:53] that's how we're gonna get out of here
[18:55] is making sure every every child every
[18:57] every person of God gets that new birth
[18:59] gets that experience kind of Statute
[19:01] perfect man comes to Perfection and then
[19:02] we can all leave so that's why we need
[19:05] to continue the missionary field so I'm
[19:06] very grateful for that
[19:08] and also just um
[19:11] just to know that you know we have
[19:12] brothers and sisters everywhere and that
[19:14] we all know each other you know by
[19:16] by the spirit you know even brother
[19:18] Brandon said you can talk to someone and
[19:19] you can figure out that whether or not
[19:21] they're a Christian within five minutes
[19:22] so and just to be able to talk to people
[19:24] and even through the language barrier we
[19:26] can understand that they're you know
[19:27] Spirit-filled Christians and
[19:28] Spirit-filled Believers it was good to
[19:30] know them so I think that first well
[19:31] with uh the song I want to sing
[19:33] which is they will know we were
[19:35] Christians by our love

[19:52] are one in the Lord and we pray that all

[24:49] know just a world but they're so sweet
[24:51] to me I didn't know what was different
[24:52] about them
[24:53] but now they're messy Believers maybe
[24:54] they pray for me
[24:56] so I'm just grateful for their kindness
[24:58] so you never know you're meeting like
[24:59] how they look or don't judge people how
[25:01] they look don't judge a book by its
[25:03] cover

[25:05] heart you know I know in my heart like I
[25:07] always want to be clean and that's what
[25:09] drawed me to this message it's like we
[25:11] went to like some kind of little fake
[25:12] church I just call it that before we end
[25:15] up comes to the message he was raising
[25:16] the message and I came to the next

[25:19] dress better I was like I'm like what
[25:20] these other girls dressing bad I'm gonna
[25:21] continue and how I need to dress but
[25:24] when I heard the true word of the
[25:25] message like I knew that this was a true
[25:28] salvation for a woman to wear a dress
[25:30] like you know like the 100 way like not
[25:32] 60 not 40 not 10 and I want to encourage
[25:36] every sister and brother to keep your
[25:38] purity

[25:42] your Purity is worth so much it's so

[31:30] [Applause]
[31:39] but you know it was even better when she
[31:42] stuck her testimony into that right when
[31:45] you plug yourself into these songs is
[31:46] what they don't just write them in fill
[31:48] up paper
[31:50] it's got to mean something and when they
[31:52] got the inspiration to write it God was
[31:55] telling that writer to put it on paper
[31:56] so that sister Alicia can sing it today
[31:58] that's the way I see
[32:01] the thing the the inspiration that's why
[32:03] I like specials
[32:05] because it comes from your heart not
[32:07] everybody's saying and it comes from
[32:08] your heart it's a special God put on
[32:09] your heart to sing to the people well
[32:11] that thought was before the foundation
[32:12] of the world Amen we thank all ever we
[32:15] always think brother John the preacher
[32:17] the preacher preaching is number one we
[32:19] know that but thank God for inspired
[32:22] songwriters like we were talking about
[32:24] John and Charles Wesley Charles Wesley
[32:26] you know John Wesley was a messenger to
[32:27] the church age but Charles Wesley wrote
[32:30] 6 000 songs and they weren't Boogie
[32:32] Woogie
[32:33] for those of you that know what Boogie
[32:35] Woogie is that's rock music and all that
[32:38] other stuff no he wrote 6 000 songs that
[32:40] you and I can connect to God with amen
[32:44] through song that's why David the
[32:46] psalmist David
[32:48] was a man after God's Own Heart because
[32:50] he sang
[32:51] and those evil spirits would just go
[32:52] away from you'll try that sometime have

[38:06] when you see the word promise for your
[38:08] day being manifested you have saw Jesus
[38:11] for he is the word amen
[38:13] he's just changed his mask
[38:16] you know here not long ago when we was
[38:17] all wearing masks I had traveled
[38:19] somewhere to preach I stopped in to get
[38:21] something to drink and I was standing
[38:23] there next to the Tater chips and this
[38:25] guy comes walking in he must have been a
[38:27] local and the lady behind the cash
[38:28] register she she looked at him when she
[38:31] comes in she does it a double take she
[38:32] goes why John you've changed your mask
[38:36] in which she said when she said that I
[38:38] about shouted past the potato chips
[38:40] because I just called a revelation I
[38:42] thought that's exactly right he's just
[38:43] changed his mask the same God that was
[38:46] in Jesus the groom is now in his bride
[38:49] making himself the same yesterday today
[38:51] and forever what a privilege it is to
[38:53] know the truth amen
[38:55] when we're living in a time when nobody
[38:57] knows what to believe no more CNN says
[39:00] Fox is wrong fox says CNN's line and oh
[39:03] my but I'm so glad that we don't have
[39:05] Fox News but we got the good news
[39:07] amen and we can look in the back of the
[39:10] book and we find out we win
[39:12] we win amen we need to fight with that
[39:15] revelation
[39:16] that we win is that right you know when
[39:19] I was in the Army many many years ago I
[39:21] was up at Fort Bragg with the 18th
[39:22] Airborne Corps up there as Airborne
[39:24] artillery and
[39:25] it gave me a steel pot they gave me an
[39:28] M16 rifle that gave me a m203 grenade
[39:31] launcher that was mounted underneath my
[39:33] 16 they gave me combat boots they gave
[39:35] me a backpack they gave me all this
[39:37] stuff to fight with but they never gave
[39:39] me a promise that I would win
[39:43] no they didn't they said go in there you
[39:45] know good luck
[39:47] but in God's Army
[39:49] he gave us the helmet of salvation amen
[39:52] he shot her feet with the preparation of
[39:54] the gospel and he gave us the promise we
[39:58] win
[40:00] praise the lord well if you have your
[40:02] Bibles to see the true words of the book
[40:03] of Matthews want to read from Matthews
[40:05] chapter 27 starting at verse 15. we
[40:08] greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[40:09] and I was supposed to be in the
[40:12] Nicaragua Nicaragua meetings myself this
[40:15] year but my wife was in an automobile
[40:17] accident and totaled the car and she
[40:19] suffered a concussion and some some back
[40:21] injury and I just I just couldn't leave
[40:24] My Little Queen so uh so we uh canceled
[40:28] and didn't go but I heard the meetings
[40:29] was really good and we're just just
[40:31] grateful for those that were able to go
[40:32] and if you've never been there it is a
[40:34] humbling experience
[40:36] just precious precious people you know
[40:38] barbam said about the Spanish people
[40:39] said they get their healing because
[40:41] they're willing to eat the crumbs and
[40:43] just just a real humble people that that
[40:46] would have been my 15th trip I think a
[40:48] guy or two Nicaragua but I've been there
[40:50] with brother Louise before just really
[40:52] good people there and I'm sorry we
[40:54] couldn't get to go but I've certainly
[40:56] heard some good reports from the meeting
[40:57] so we're thankful for that I want to
[40:59] read now from Matthew chapter 27
[41:01] starting at verse 15 and I know I spit a
[41:04] little bit when I preached but I didn't
[41:06] realize I spit that bad everybody's
[41:07] sitting towards the back so
[41:09] but I'll try to watch it y'all move a
[41:13] little bit closer in the morning and
[41:14] I'll try to watch it I'm not just
[41:16] kidding just
[41:17] Matthew 27 starting at 15. do you love
[41:20] him
[41:22] the Bible says this
[41:24] now at the feast the governor was want
[41:26] to release unto the people a prisoner
[41:29] whom they would
[41:31] and they had then a noble prisoner
[41:33] called Barabbas
[41:34] and therefore when they were gathered
[41:36] together pilate said unto them whom were
[41:39] ye that I release unto you Barabbas
[41:42] or Jesus which is called Christ
[41:46] for he knew that for Envy they had
[41:49] delivered him
[41:50] and when he was set down on the Judgment
[41:52] seat his wife said unto him saying how
[41:54] thou nothing to do with this just man
[41:55] for I've suffered many things this day
[41:57] in a dream because of him
[42:00] but the chief priests and the elders
[42:02] persuaded the multitude be careful who
[42:05] persuades you
[42:06] the chief priests and the elders
[42:08] persuaded the multitude that they should
[42:10] ask Barabbas and Destroy Jesus and the
[42:15] governor answered and said unto them
[42:17] whether of the twain will ye that I
[42:18] release unto you and they said Barabbas
[42:22] and pilate said unto them what shall I
[42:25] do then with Jesus which is called
[42:27] Christ and they all said unto him let
[42:31] him be crucified
[42:33] and the governor said why
[42:36] what evil hath he done but they cried
[42:39] out the more saying let him be crucified
[42:42] and when pilate saw that he could
[42:45] Prevail nothing but rather atonement was
[42:47] made and he took water and washed his
[42:49] hands before the multitude saying I am
[42:51] innocent of the blood of this just
[42:54] person
[42:55] but you see the prophet taught us the
[42:57] only way to get his blood off of your
[42:58] hands is to receive it into your heart
[43:02] I'm innocent of the blood of this just
[43:04] person see you to it then answered all
[43:07] the people and said his blood be on us
[43:10] and on our children
[43:12] then released he Barabbas unto them and
[43:15] when he had scourged Jesus he delivered
[43:18] him to be crucified
[43:20] let us bow our heads
[43:23] I want to speak to you for a few minutes
[43:24] this evening on release
[43:27] the prisoner
[43:32] Heavenly Father
[43:37] Lord as we bow our heads before you
[43:43] we are so grateful dear God for your
[43:46] word
[43:48] and Lord that it's not just letter only
[43:50] but there's a life behind the word
[43:55] and Lord that your word can still speak
[43:58] to our hearts Lord and change the
[44:02] condition of people's lives
[44:05] and Lord I pray this afternoon as we've
[44:07] gathered here Lord with these young
[44:09] people
[44:10] the father may be something be said that
[44:12] would encourage them Lord to look
[44:15] to see Lord that a way of Escape has
[44:19] been provided
[44:21] for David said unto our God belongs the
[44:24] issue from death and that word means the
[44:27] Escape you are the Escape Route Lord the
[44:30] exit door out of here
[44:31] we are so grateful Lord in such a
[44:34] Troublesome time
[44:36] when men's hearts are continually evil
[44:39] yet Lord your word will prevail
[44:42] and I pray dear Lord may you receive
[44:44] honor and Glory unto yourself
[44:46] father God if this whole Gathering to
[44:49] this week and would be for the sake of
[44:51] one's soul
[44:52] may your word touch that Soul this day I
[44:55] pray
[44:56] heal our sick Lord and encourage those
[44:59] that are discouraged
[45:01] set the prisoner free
[45:03] granted Lord for we ask these things in
[45:06] Jesus name and the bride says
[45:09] God bless you may be seated
[45:14] amen
[45:17] as our scriptures open this afternoon
[45:21] we find ourself in a Roman prison house
[45:27] now come with me for just a few minutes
[45:30] in your mind
[45:32] let's take this little trip back to this
[45:34] Roman prison
[45:37] and as we make our way down the hall of
[45:40] this pest House of a prison
[45:44] we come to realize that we are making
[45:47] our way down death row
[45:50] that these are the cells of the
[45:52] prisoners of Rome
[45:54] who have been sentenced to death for
[45:57] their crimes against Rome
[46:01] can you imagine
[46:03] the smell
[46:05] the the unsanitary conditions and the
[46:08] the the the rats and no good food and no
[46:11] good water because after all these men
[46:14] are condemned to death
[46:17] so there's no use to try to preserve
[46:19] their life when they've been condemned
[46:21] to die
[46:23] but let me say this afternoon that every
[46:26] person born on this Earth was born under
[46:29] a sentence of death
[46:32] we were if you will we were born on
[46:35] death row
[46:37] for David said behold I was shaped in
[46:39] iniquity and did an incended my mother
[46:42] conceive me
[46:44] from the moment that we were conceived
[46:47] we are on our path to death
[46:51] you know many people today they have
[46:53] this idea I don't need nobody
[46:55] I don't need no friends I I don't need
[46:58] no help I'm doing all right by myself
[47:00] I'm I'm smart and I I've got money and I
[47:04] can figure it out and I can make my own
[47:06] way
[47:07] but you see the prophet of God said you
[47:09] were born defeated
[47:11] and that birth can never bring you to
[47:14] life
[47:15] people strive so hard to be famous or to
[47:18] be popular or to be a movie star but
[47:21] nine times out of ten most of those
[47:23] people end up with their lives destroyed
[47:27] Katie Spade that people spends thousands
[47:30] of dollars to buy a Katie Spade purse
[47:33] what did Katie Spade do hang herself in
[47:36] a hotel room
[47:38] Robin Williams a comedian that made
[47:41] everybody laugh and everybody what did
[47:43] he do hung himself in a hotel room
[47:47] because we're born defeated and there's
[47:50] nothing that we can ever do within
[47:51] ourself that would ever bring us to life
[47:54] the prophet said you're in a defeated
[47:57] World amongst defeated people amongst
[47:59] defeated Creeds and defeated
[48:01] denominations but you've got to come to
[48:04] Victory somehow
[48:06] and before there could ever be a victory
[48:08] there must be a Victor
[48:13] but you see man was not born that way
[48:15] man was meant to be born free
[48:19] but now we find them
[48:22] that these men here on death row that
[48:24] they have been sentenced to die by
[48:27] crucifixion
[48:28] one of the most horrible forms of death
[48:31] that there were
[48:33] right oh friends it's terrible what sin
[48:36] can do to you
[48:39] you know brother man talked about the
[48:41] eagle that was in a cage
[48:43] and they said that eagle had just been
[48:45] captured and it was one of the most
[48:46] pitiful sights that I ever had the
[48:48] privilege of seeing he said that great
[48:51] Heavenly bird had been captured and
[48:53] netted by someone and thrown into a cage
[48:56] and that poor fellow was so out of place
[48:59] that he would jump with all with that
[49:01] was within him against those big bars
[49:03] flopping his wings only to find himself
[49:06] to fall back on his back and he said
[49:08] then that poor Eagle had beat himself
[49:10] against those bars until all of his
[49:12] feathers was beat off from his wings and
[49:14] his head and his face was bruised and he
[49:16] said I watched him again proudly walked
[49:18] back and with all that was in he report
[49:20] himself against the bars only to find
[49:23] himself not backwards again
[49:25] but he said that eagle he wouldn't quit
[49:28] because he was out of place he didn't
[49:30] blow over
[49:32] he wanted to be free he was born to be
[49:35] free there was something in him that
[49:37] told him this ain't who you really are
[49:41] right oh my saints of God let me say
[49:43] this afternoon I'm not going to quit if
[49:46] I get knocked down I'm going to get back
[49:47] up if I fail I'm going to ask
[49:49] forgiveness but I'm not going to quit
[49:51] because I don't belong here I come from
[49:54] somewhere else amen I come from God I
[49:56] must go back to God
[49:58] [Applause]
[50:01] prophes Tennessee laid there on that
[50:03] floor in those weary eyes soared the
[50:04] skies he said I thought what a pitiful
[50:06] sight made not to be on the earth here
[50:09] he's a Heavenly bird his whole makeup
[50:11] was to live in the blue way above the
[50:13] honks and the cares of this world but to
[50:16] see a bird like that that was made up
[50:18] borned into Earth to soar the skies
[50:23] yet caged in such a way that it could
[50:27] never soar the skies again
[50:31] a prisoner and a man made
[50:35] cage
[50:37] a prisoner
[50:39] and the prophet said as he laid there
[50:41] looking at that place where he had been
[50:43] made born to soar
[50:46] he would not give up because something
[50:48] inside of him kept telling him I don't
[50:51] belong here
[50:53] maybe you're sitting here this afternoon
[50:56] you're singing the songs
[50:59] and you with the song service and you as
[51:01] a part of it and singing the songs
[51:03] and you're looking at a place and
[51:05] something in your heart is telling you
[51:07] this is where you belong
[51:09] this is where you belong maybe you've
[51:11] never surrendered to God in your life
[51:13] and maybe you've just been but something
[51:15] you keep hearing the songs and the
[51:16] testimonies and the sisters he poured
[51:19] out our heart and something keeps
[51:20] telling you this is where I belong this
[51:22] is what I'm missing in my life
[51:26] in that ego you know you know this this
[51:28] is not where I belong this is not what I
[51:30] was born to be but by the cunniness of
[51:33] man this ego had been cased for life and
[51:35] the promise said what a pitiful sight it
[51:37] is but I tell you something friends
[51:39] something more pitiful than that is to
[51:41] see men and women who were born and
[51:43] shaped in the image of God to be Sons
[51:45] and Daughters of God to be find them
[51:48] caged by sin and habits and the cares of
[51:52] this world I'm not talking about just
[51:54] the ones out there in the bar room I'm
[51:55] talking about the ones that set Among Us
[51:57] on message views and yet they're still
[51:59] caged
[52:01] it's far more pitiful than that eagle
[52:04] man was not made to be bound man is a
[52:07] free man whom the son hath made free
[52:10] it's free indeed
[52:12] man doesn't have to be bound like that
[52:16] oh my the different things that cages
[52:18] men and deny them of their god-given
[52:21] privileges man-made man made in the
[52:25] image of his God
[52:26] it doesn't have to be us it doesn't have
[52:30] to be bound a slave to Satan he wasn't
[52:33] made to be a Slave
[52:35] it was made to be a Son of God God made
[52:38] man in his own image amen
[52:41] as we move
[52:43] down this Hall
[52:44] we come to sell number five
[52:49] now this cell belongs to the most feared
[52:52] probably the meanest man in the region
[52:55] his name is Barabbas
[52:58] is actually his name is Jesus Barabbas
[53:02] which means Barabbas means son of the
[53:05] father
[53:06] this man was a murderer
[53:09] he was a thief he was a credible but all
[53:12] of his meanness and his evilness had
[53:14] caught up with him and now he was going
[53:16] to pay the price
[53:18] and let me say young people you may
[53:20] think you're getting away with it you
[53:22] may think that what you're doing that
[53:23] nobody knows that you're doing it
[53:25] but I want you to understand this
[53:27] afternoon there is an All-Seeing Eye
[53:30] watching every one of us
[53:33] and there is a payday that's coming
[53:36] for being assured if we sow it we will
[53:39] also reap it amen
[53:42] this man Barabbas who had brought such
[53:44] fear upon the people when you mentioned
[53:47] his name people were scared to death of
[53:49] the name of Barabbas
[53:51] but this man who had brought such fear
[53:54] and such distress now he was feeling it
[53:58] himself
[54:01] the prophet said all night long he
[54:03] walked up and down that jail pulling his
[54:05] hair for the next morning he would go to
[54:07] a cross capital punishment he would die
[54:10] and have the nightmares passed over him
[54:12] that night and how he couldn't rest
[54:14] knowing the agony and the pain that he
[54:17] would soon face death by crucifixion
[54:21] you see where sin had brought him to
[54:25] that's what sin had brought him to
[54:28] oh he thought he's having him a big time
[54:30] when he was doing it
[54:32] reaping the benefits of his evilness
[54:35] but now and at all
[54:37] up to him
[54:39] and the one who had brought such fear
[54:42] was now experiencing fear himself
[54:47] you know that was in Matamoras Mexico
[54:51] a sister there had a young boy raised in
[54:53] a message Church
[54:55] but he wanted to be a part of this
[54:57] cartel
[55:00] so he left the message Church to follow
[55:02] this this idea of being a gangster
[55:07] but all this gangster caught up with him
[55:10] because the boy disappeared
[55:14] and his mother salt and salt and salt to
[55:16] find out what happened to her son who
[55:20] went to a message search his grandfather
[55:22] was the pastor of the church
[55:25] and finally she got word from the cartel
[55:28] do not look for your son
[55:31] there is no body
[55:33] for we bear we we put him in a barrel of
[55:36] acid
[55:38] and this there is nobody because she
[55:40] asked him if he would just give me my
[55:41] son's body that I could bury him and
[55:44] finally after all these months of
[55:46] Wayland And they said word do not look
[55:48] for your son there is no body
[55:54] so all of his desire to be a gangster
[55:57] look what his gangster brought him
[56:00] and that's where we find barabba smell
[56:03] it had all caught up with him
[56:06] and let me say this afternoon that there
[56:09] is in this building a thief
[56:14] but this thief he doesn't want your

[1:03:46] floor knowing the prophet said that in
[1:03:48] the next morning no breakfast or nothing
[1:03:50] knowing that his blood would be strung
[1:03:52] out like among the wolves

[1:03:56] rattling Prophet said trampling of the
[1:03:58] soldiers Here Comes four or five maybe a
[1:03:59] battalion of Roman soldiers and Spirits
[1:04:01] glittering walking up there in that big
[1:04:03] Jailer turns the key says Barabbas walk
[1:04:05] out
[1:04:07] so you think he felt that morning when
[1:04:10] you heard the Romans coming with those
[1:04:11] big galleries the Big Iron shoes are
[1:04:13] stopping along chains around the spirits
[1:04:15] dragging on the street to know he's
[1:04:16] going to be killed when he opened up the
[1:04:19] doors Barabbas trembled and cried ready
[1:04:21] to run saying this is the end of me
[1:04:24] and now we seem are you still with me
[1:04:27] and now you see we see here
[1:04:30] Jesus
[1:04:31] we see pilate Jesus is on the right hand
[1:04:35] the rabbits on Pilots left standing
[1:04:38] before the people
[1:04:40] knowing that the Jews would release one
[1:04:44] pilate says who do you want
[1:04:48] on one hand was Barabbas a thief a
[1:04:51] murderer a liar evil in his flesh he
[1:04:55] wasn't accused of this that's who he
[1:04:57] actually was
[1:05:02] he wasn't falsely accused he was guilty
[1:05:04] he knew he was guilty
[1:05:10] and on the other hand was Jesus the son
[1:05:13] of God the Holy One the Messiah
[1:05:15] one who done nothing but evil and one
[1:05:18] who'd done nothing but good healed the
[1:05:21] sick raised the dead there was no
[1:05:23] comparison
[1:05:25] the crowd
[1:05:27] Cries Out
[1:05:29] Barabbas
[1:05:31] give us Barabbas
[1:05:35] what shall I do with Jesus called the
[1:05:37] Christ crucify him
[1:05:39] they were crying for his blood
[1:05:43] but little did they know that's exactly
[1:05:46] what they needed
[1:05:49] they didn't realize it
[1:05:52] maybe you fail to realize the thing you
[1:05:55] need the thing you need to make your
[1:05:57] life complete is in this building right
[1:06:00] now
[1:06:06] release the prisoner release the
[1:06:09] prisoner release Barabbas
[1:06:11] give us Barabbas and Jesus stood there
[1:06:16] oh I can see it in my mind Jesus stood
[1:06:18] there silently for he knew the will of
[1:06:21] the father
[1:06:22] he knew the father's will
[1:06:25] he said father let them have Barabbas
[1:06:28] for Jesus knew
[1:06:35] that's our sister sunk there is no
[1:06:37] friend
[1:06:38] like the lovely Jesus he stood there
[1:06:41] silent his father give them the rabbits
[1:06:44] because he knew
[1:06:48] the father would have to treat Jesus
[1:06:50] like Barabbas so he could treat Barabbas
[1:06:53] like Jesus
[1:07:00] he became me that I might become him by
[1:07:04] grace
[1:07:06] you see Barabbas story was the people
[1:07:08] that made him free
[1:07:11] he thought it was the will of the people
[1:07:13] that set him free and let me save this
[1:07:15] nation it's been upon liberty and
[1:07:17] justice for all and in their desire to
[1:07:20] be free they are more bound than ever
[1:07:24] listen to me there is no law there is no
[1:07:28] law made by man that will ever make us
[1:07:31] free
[1:07:34] amen
[1:07:36] no no Barabbas
[1:07:39] no
[1:07:40] it wasn't the people that set you free
[1:07:43] it was the love of God that set him free
[1:07:47] for you see Jesus was the very Heart Of
[1:07:50] God expressed

[1:08:22] for us

[1:08:28] platform in my sins and my guilt and my
[1:08:31] failures I condemned prisoner Chained
[1:08:34] and Shackled by Satan caught up in his
[1:08:36] wealth Guilty by birth but Jesus said

[1:08:44] let wait go
[1:08:49] son of the father son of the father let
[1:08:52] him go let the prisoner go

[1:08:57] they took him to Calvary and there they
[1:09:00] crucified him and in his dying minutes
[1:09:03] minutes his life leaving his body and
[1:09:06] the pain was so great
[1:09:08] he cried out either
[1:09:14] my God my God why is Thou forsaken me

[1:10:49] but Jesus said my blood is still wet on
[1:10:52] the cross and God paid the price for the
[1:10:55] sin yes sir and I've come to take over

[1:14:11] alcoholic

[1:14:16] program three different times she said I
[1:14:20] cannot stop drinking
[1:14:23] she said I'll go for a while and then I
[1:14:25] fall right back into it I've got a young
[1:14:27] child I don't even know who the father
[1:14:28] is because I was drunk
[1:14:32] and I said you know what I do if I was
[1:14:34] you sis I would lay that alcohol at the
[1:14:37] altar
[1:14:38] right and I would take my freedom in
[1:14:41] Christ
[1:14:43] you lay it down and accept what it for
[1:14:45] you
[1:14:46] and I begin to pray for that young girl
[1:14:48] I'll never forget it she began to scream
[1:14:50] to the top of her lungs I'm free I'm
[1:14:54] free I'm free
[1:14:56] Hallelujah and I was up there just the
[1:14:58] other night not long ago and she came up

[1:15:03] been sober for two years why because
[1:15:05] whom the son hath made free is free
[1:15:08] indeed
[1:15:09] [Applause]
[1:15:10] if he can do that in Alaska he could do

[1:15:16] fear oppression depression
[1:15:21] you can go free

[1:15:29] and you this afternoon I don't care if
[1:15:31] you're eight or eighty

[1:15:45] you can close the door
[1:15:47] stay in your cell
[1:15:50] net pastels
[1:15:52] and that coldness of fear isolation
[1:15:57] or you can go free
[1:16:00] the door's been open
[1:16:02] well if he would only do it he's already
[1:16:04] done it
[1:16:06] you just have to receive it
[1:16:08] you know I was eating in the restaurant
[1:16:09] the other day I'm closing
[1:16:13] I was in a restaurant the other day
[1:16:15] the waitress come up to me and said with
[1:16:17] my family said is there anything else
[1:16:18] you want I said no ma'am that's that's
[1:16:20] fine I said if you'll just bring the
[1:16:21] check
[1:16:23] she said your check has been took care
[1:16:25] of
[1:16:26] I said excuse me she said somebody saw
[1:16:28] you in here and they wanted to buy your
[1:16:30] meal
[1:16:32] said I said well let me give you she
[1:16:34] said the tip they even gave me a tip
[1:16:38] now I could have done one or two things
[1:16:40] I could have argued with her are you
[1:16:42] sure it's me maybe it's that table over
[1:16:44] there you're talking about her yeah I
[1:16:46] didn't see nobody in here that that knew
[1:16:47] me you are you sure it's me are you sure
[1:16:50] but maybe I better go ahead and pay it
[1:16:52] because I'll go out that door and you'll
[1:16:53] you'll say I'll try to steal a meal
[1:16:58] I could have sat there and argued just
[1:17:00] like some of you argue with him
[1:17:04] or I could have received what was done
[1:17:08] for me and walk out
[1:17:10] with a free meal
[1:17:14] you can receive
[1:17:16] what he's done for you
[1:17:18] and walk out
[1:17:19] with a free meal
[1:17:21] and that pizza will taste a whole lot
[1:17:23] better
[1:17:24] when the chains of your enemy
[1:17:27] is off of you
[1:17:29] to be
[1:17:30] Unshackled
[1:17:33] I wonder if we can see what Barabbas saw
[1:17:37] someone taking their place
[1:17:40] think about it
[1:17:43] can we come this afternoon
[1:17:45] on the basis
[1:17:46] of what Christ's done for me
[1:17:49] just do like that young girl give him
[1:17:51] your shame give him your pain give him
[1:17:54] your weakness give him your sin give him
[1:17:57] your habit give him your fear give him
[1:18:00] your depression
[1:18:03] give it to you
[1:18:07] and walk away
[1:18:09] free
[1:18:11] for he said release
[1:18:13] the prisoner
[1:18:15] let the son of the father
[1:18:18] go free
[1:18:25] amen he took our place
[1:18:28] he went from the cross to the Grave
[1:18:31] from the grave to the sky and he said
[1:18:34] where I am
[1:18:36] there
[1:18:37] shall you be also
[1:18:40] the prison doors are open for it you can
[1:18:42] step out this afternoon you see Jesus
[1:18:45] was the conduit he was the channel
[1:18:47] that brought the son
[1:18:49] back to
[1:18:50] the father
[1:18:52] do you love him
[1:18:55] let us power us
[1:18:59] oh Heavenly Father
[1:19:02] thank you Lord Jesus
[1:19:06] thank you Lord Jesus
[1:19:11] thank you Lord
[1:19:13] what a friend
[1:19:15] we have in Jesus
[1:19:18] where no one could help me
[1:19:21] when I couldn't even help myself
[1:19:23] you've done for me
[1:19:26] but no other
[1:19:27] could do
[1:19:30] oh God
[1:19:33] maybe Satan's been lying to some of
[1:19:35] these young people
[1:19:36] maybe they've been coming to this church
[1:19:39] just sitting on the people they feel
[1:19:40] like they don't fit in they don't belong
[1:19:44] because Satan has told him it's not for
[1:19:46] you
[1:19:47] you're not one of them
[1:19:49] or maybe they've looked at some of the
[1:19:51] lies that's been posted on the internet
[1:19:53] and it's confused their minds
[1:19:56] Satan trying to lock them up
[1:19:59] in a prison House of confusion
[1:20:03] or whatever it would be Lord
[1:20:06] we spoke of many different things but
[1:20:08] maybe something here that someone's
[1:20:10] dealing with that wasn't a Spoke but
[1:20:11] Lord may they realize even though I
[1:20:12] wasn't spoke
[1:20:14] they can still go free from that Lord
[1:20:17] For Whom the son is made free
[1:20:20] is free indeed
[1:20:23] oh Father may we realize
[1:20:26] May each of us realize Lord
[1:20:28] that Barabbas
[1:20:31] it's me
[1:20:33] son of the father
[1:20:37] and oh God I prayed this afternoon
[1:20:42] let there be one Lord who could step out
[1:20:44] free
[1:20:47] in these meetings have not been invading
[1:20:49] Lord
[1:20:51] God you see the needs of your people the
[1:20:54] congregation decides Lord no doubt
[1:20:56] there's many needs some sick Lord some
[1:20:57] battling different things cancers Lord
[1:21:00] whatever it would be I I don't know Lord
[1:21:03] but you know every person here
[1:21:06] and I pray in the name of Jesus by the
[1:21:08] same anointing that raised my Lord from
[1:21:10] the grave
[1:21:11] may it move upon each heart
[1:21:14] and upon each home Lord
[1:21:17] granted this afternoon I pray father God
[1:21:20] in Jesus name
[1:21:23] whatever heads bowed just a moment not
[1:21:24] to point you out friend I would never do
[1:21:26] that
[1:21:27] but if you're here
[1:21:29] and you believe that God sent this
[1:21:31] message for you and maybe you're dealing
[1:21:33] with things your parents don't even know
[1:21:34] your brothers and sisters don't know
[1:21:35] your husband your wife nobody knows but
[1:21:38] you
[1:21:39] that this message just spoke to you and
[1:21:41] you believe the report
[1:21:43] you know I I don't know what Barabbas
[1:21:45] done I I've looked at different places
[1:21:47] I've never really found out
[1:21:50] what Barabbas done with this freedom
[1:21:52] but I want to ask you this afternoon
[1:21:54] what are you going to do with your
[1:21:56] freedom
[1:21:57] that's already been given to you we'll
[1:21:59] accept it
[1:22:00] or will you close the prison door and
[1:22:03] stay because you see anytime you come to
[1:22:05] a service the prophet said you will be
[1:22:07] better or worse off
[1:22:09] and I say to you don't leave worse
[1:22:12] the prison door is opened
[1:22:14] if he'd done it up here in Alaska for
[1:22:16] that young girl
[1:22:18] he could do it here in Lula Georgia for
[1:22:20] you
[1:22:21] and if you're here I just wonder if you
[1:22:23] would just slip up to your feet and say
[1:22:25] would you remember me brother Daryl
[1:22:27] ah
[1:22:29] friend I don't need to know he knows he
[1:22:32] already knows
[1:22:34] what would you say I want to accept my
[1:22:36] freedom today
[1:22:37] Satan's been lying to me I ain't gonna
[1:22:40] take that lie no more I'm going to stand
[1:22:42] on the promise of the word
[1:22:44] would there be one
[1:22:46] would there be one
[1:22:53] amen

[1:22:59] look at the freedom he gave you
[1:23:01] know why don't you give him your shame
[1:23:04] why don't you give him your fear why
[1:23:07] don't you give him that besetting sin
[1:23:10] and step out free
[1:23:13] would there be anyone

[1:33:38] let's give our brother a good hands
[1:33:43] he opened his heart out to him
[1:33:47] now let's open our heart out
[1:33:50] and praise God that's who he was
[1:33:52] preaching about he wasn't preaching
[1:33:53] about himself he was preaching about God
[1:33:56] I was thinking while he was ministering
[1:33:59] you know I read you that quote not too
[1:34:01] long ago where brother Brown said
[1:34:03] uh sister Alicia was talking about
[1:34:04] holding yourself that's why that's why
[1:34:07] your virginity that's why you're that's
[1:34:10] why it's so important because you take
[1:34:12] it over to the spiritual part
[1:34:13] and and listen
[1:34:17] but there comes one time remember I read
[1:34:19] the quote brother Brown said you've held
[1:34:21] yourself
[1:34:22] all your life
[1:34:24] all your life you've held yourself you
[1:34:27] fought off them Devils called boys you
[1:34:29] thought off all the things to stay pure
[1:34:31] but there's one day you got to give up
[1:34:34] what you've been saving all your life
[1:34:37] when you give it all to your husband
[1:34:39] [Music]
[1:34:41] what a special thing so now let's take
[1:34:44] it over to the spiritual part we've had
[1:34:46] demons beat on us we've had Devils all
[1:34:49] over us and we've tried our best to stay
[1:34:51] the Virgin bride of Jesus Christ but one
[1:34:53] day folks we got to give it we got to
[1:34:55] surrender everything we are
[1:34:57] to our husband he'll never do us wrong
[1:35:01] he'll never divorce US
[1:35:03] amen we're the bride
[1:35:05] we're the reason
[1:35:07] that he came back
[1:35:10] on the day of Pentecost was to get a
[1:35:12] bride ready
[1:35:14] but have we surrendered all
[1:35:16] have we went ahead and said Okay God
[1:35:19] you're my husband
[1:35:21] I'm giving you everything I got
[1:35:24] everything I got
[1:35:26] that's why the song I surrender all
[1:35:28] that's good
[1:35:30] but if you're not raising your hand you
[1:35:32] ain't surrender
[1:35:34] universal sign of surrender Universal
[1:35:37] all over the world when you throw both
[1:35:39] hands up like this you've surrendered
[1:35:43] now what I tell you if you put one hand
[1:35:45] behind your back and you surrender like
[1:35:47] this
[1:35:48] no you might get shot
[1:35:52] because you can use this hand to get
[1:35:53] whatever gun knife whatever but when you
[1:35:55] got both hands up in the air
[1:35:58] there's nothing you can do
[1:36:01] so that's what we're going to do today
[1:36:03] we're going to give our all
[1:36:05] like that sign says back there and that
[1:36:07] brother Daryl preached that sermon years
[1:36:09] ago
[1:36:11] about giving our All to Jesus Christ and
[1:36:13] that's why it's on that door back there
[1:36:14] as you walk in
[1:36:16] he's talking about the football team you
[1:36:17] know saying that we give today we give
[1:36:19] all the Tennessee football he had been
[1:36:21] down there and looked in the stadium and
[1:36:23] they hit it they hit the door every time
[1:36:26] they go out
[1:36:28] have you give your all today
[1:36:30] if they can do it out in the world and
[1:36:32] act crazy jump up and down shout and
[1:36:35] scream for their favorite team I think
[1:36:36] we ought to do the same thing for our
[1:36:38] favorite team amen team Jesus amen team
[1:36:42] Jesus will never let he'll never lose
[1:36:46] yeah you ain't got to look for the score
[1:36:48] it's already done
[1:36:50] he wanted Calvary but thank God there
[1:36:54] was a Barabbas
[1:36:56] because it proved who Jesus was
[1:36:59] right it proved who Jesus was it proved
[1:37:02] that somebody had to take my place
[1:37:06] so that I could go free
[1:37:08] right Hey listen the crowd they hated
[1:37:11] Jesus
[1:37:12] they gonna hate you
[1:37:14] they wanted Barabbas they wanted a thief
[1:37:15] and a liar that's what same thing in the
[1:37:17] world all you young people they love you
[1:37:18] out there why they love you out there
[1:37:20] because you just like them
[1:37:21] but when you make a stand for God when
[1:37:24] you surrender yourself to him
[1:37:26] you become real odd to the world because
[1:37:29] the world will surrender themselves to
[1:37:31] drugs alcohol all the different things
[1:37:33] of the world
[1:37:35] but if you surrender today you surrender
[1:37:36] all to Jesus Christ you'll never lose
[1:37:40] and he said I'll never leave you he said
[1:37:42] I never forsake Him
[1:37:44] we've had a good time
[1:37:46] just getting started everything's all
[1:37:48] good good to see everybody here again

[2:09:38] I'm watching online somebody wasn't even
[2:09:40] a message preacher oh good grief
[2:09:47] but you know
[2:09:49] I always wondered why the prodigal son's
[2:09:52] father
[2:09:54] ran to him
[2:09:56] the Bible tells us when he sees when he
[2:09:59] sees them when he sees his son
[2:10:02] he runs to him
[2:10:05] you know why
[2:10:07] now that's not in the Bible but Jewish
[2:10:09] tradition
[2:10:10] tells us or told that person that done
[2:10:13] some study the reason the father had to
[2:10:16] run to the gates of the city to get the
[2:10:18] sun before the sun entered into the
[2:10:21] into the city was that under Jewish
[2:10:25] tradition if you got an inheritance and
[2:10:28] you wasted it on Gentile
[2:10:31] righteous living you know he went out he
[2:10:33] got rid of all his money and he bought
[2:10:36] and sold and got all kind of stuff and
[2:10:38] got in a bad way
[2:10:39] but you couldn't come back in the city
[2:10:41] they'd Stone you
[2:10:44] so the father
[2:10:47] the father knew that
[2:10:49] right and before the devil the people of
[2:10:52] the because see if he didn't let that
[2:10:53] guy walk on him if he'd let his son walk
[2:10:55] on it doesn't matter son or not they
[2:10:57] could have stoned him they could have
[2:10:58] killed him but he went out remember put
[2:11:01] the code around him he said welcome home
[2:11:03] right in other words I'm going to take
[2:11:05] your shame and I'm going to bring you
[2:11:07] back into where you're supposed to be
[2:11:08] well praise God if that didn't if that
[2:11:10] didn't help you it sure helped me amen I
[2:11:13] always wonder why he ran out sure you
[2:11:15] know you're happy and but why couldn't
[2:11:16] the guy you know the son come no he had
[2:11:18] to go get him right he had to go protect
[2:11:21] him as we were talking as brother Dale
[2:11:23] was talking about Jesus looked over and
[2:11:25] he said in his in his mind he said
[2:11:27] Barabbas I Gotta Die For You
[2:11:30] I'm gonna die for you this day
[2:11:33] I'm gonna die I'm going to take your
[2:11:35] place
[2:11:37] and if he would accept in Jesus Christ
[2:11:39] you know what he would have been a
[2:11:41] Christian but he didn't we know what
[2:11:43] happened or we don't know what happened
[2:11:44] but he never was recorded anymore but we
[2:11:47] sure appreciate all of you coming let's
[2:11:48] give brother Daryl another hand and all
