[35:25] emotional and cry so y'all forgive me if
[35:27] I do cry I'm a crybaby but um when we
[35:30] first came here to preach
[35:32] um
[35:33] uh I didn't know that a few months later
[35:36] that the doctor would tell me that
[35:39] uh before we moved before we moved to
[35:42] North Carolina
[35:43] um the doctor diagnosed me with a
[35:46] condition
[35:47] um that he said I would have with I
[35:49] would have for the rest of my life
[35:51] and um
[35:53] I got discouraged and I began to accept
[35:55] what the doctor said you know even
[35:57] though the word says that God has the
[36:00] final say so
[36:01] and uh I got the I Was Defeated Within
[36:04] Myself
[36:06] um but when God wants to do something in
[36:08] your life he's going to send you some
[36:10] encouragement
[36:11] and that night I went to work and um it
[36:14] was a clip of brother uh of a pastor
[36:16] preaching and he said uh sometimes God
[36:19] allows conditions to come in your life
[36:21] just to see if you'd be crazy enough to
[36:24] believe that he'll heal you from it
[36:26] and of course y'all know me I'm I'm I
[36:29] love saying that God is going to do
[36:31] something Supernatural but not believing
[36:34] it at that time and so from that point
[36:37] on I took it and I ran with it and uh
[36:39] moved up to North Carolina and one of
[36:41] the conditions was it was a possibility
[36:43] I couldn't have children anymore
[36:45] and um
[36:47] so we were praying for a daughter and
[36:51] it just wasn't working out wasn't
[36:52] working out and we got so low to the
[36:55] point to where we both got depressed and
[36:57] broke down and
[37:01] um one day that one day it got really
[37:03] really bad and the inspiration of the
[37:06] Lord came at the right time and
[37:07] something came over me
[37:09] and I went to my wife and I said you
[37:11] tell me what you want
[37:13] and she said I want my babies and I said
[37:16] God said you'll have them

[1:02:53] anyways
[1:02:54] I'm reminded of something I believe it
[1:02:56] was Dwight Moody if I'm not mistaken
[1:02:59] said
[1:03:00] a reporter or somebody came out to see
[1:03:02] him when he was speaking and uh
[1:03:04] and went back and wrote his article and
[1:03:06] told him he said I don't know why
[1:03:07] anybody would want to go see that Dwight
[1:03:09] Moody
[1:03:10] he said he's on I forget all the terms
[1:03:12] pretty much he was country you couldn't
[1:03:14] understand him he was uncouth and this
[1:03:16] and that he wasn't educated and all
[1:03:18] these things and
[1:03:20] they brought the paper in and showed
[1:03:22] showed the white and they said you know
[1:03:24] what do you think about that he just
[1:03:25] laughed he said well of course not they
[1:03:27] didn't come to see me they came to see
[1:03:28] Jesus right amen amen we want to see him
[1:03:32] that's what it's all about amen just to
[1:03:34] see the Lord Jesus Christ you know the
[1:03:36] there's there's a greater need for Jesus
[1:03:40] Christ right now than there has ever
[1:03:42] been in the world before
[1:03:45] this world is in the Sawyer come up a
[1:03:47] little bit
[1:03:48] this world is in a sorrier state than it
[1:03:50] has ever been that's good I got the
[1:03:52] thumbs up back there I think we're all
[1:03:53] right
[1:03:54] amen

[1:03:59] got Jesus do you love him this morning
[1:04:00] amen I'm going to say morning while I
[1:04:03] can still say this morning amen and uh
[1:04:05] brother brother Wade was so gracious to
[1:04:07] to remind me of something that brother
[1:04:08] Dan daisley said he said if you sing for
[1:04:10] an hour and a half I'm going to preach
[1:04:11] for an hour and a half
[1:04:13] you didn't quite make an hour and a half

[1:04:18] uh anyways it is good to be in church
[1:04:20] this morning amen it is wonderful to be
[1:04:23] in the house of the Lord this morning I

[1:04:29] fun evening for sure amen and we we made
[1:04:31] it back to the room with no problems

[1:04:34] it's got colder as the day went on got a
[1:04:37] little rest
[1:04:38] I feel bad for the for the ministers
[1:04:40] here though
[1:04:41] I I just can imagine that that after
[1:04:44] that last game you probably had to stick
[1:04:45] around to past midnight in the
[1:04:47] counseling sessions and everything else
[1:04:50] there's just nothing like seeing a man
[1:04:52] when they say you know who who does your
[1:04:54] wife say you are Prince Charming
[1:04:57] goofy sleepy enough Dopey
[1:05:00] and the men are all like Prince Charming
[1:05:06] Goofy
[1:05:07] Goofy
[1:05:09] Dopey sleepy
[1:05:12] anything but Prince Charming the man the
[1:05:14] look that comes over those faces at that
[1:05:16] time oh my goodness gracious it's
[1:05:17] Priceless you know really
[1:05:19] you know but I told April when all this
[1:05:21] was going on brother wait I said you
[1:05:22] know I said I'm reminded of what Jesus
[1:05:23] said he said when you go to the feast
[1:05:26] don't begin to take the seat that's the
[1:05:28] highest unless they come and put you
[1:05:30] down low right so you want to put
[1:05:32] yourself low and let them bring you back
[1:05:33] up high amen so I chose Goofy
[1:05:39] but I was wrong she said sleepy amen I
[1:05:42] still wasn't I still wanting the prince
[1:05:44] charming by no means but Sleepy's a
[1:05:46] little bit better than goofy I'll take
[1:05:47] that amen

[1:05:51] really really had a good time amen and
[1:05:53] uh also I want to tell you that you know

[1:05:57] brother Wade told me to take as long
[1:05:59] as I like right as long as I like this
[1:06:03] morning and uh that that usually goes to
[1:06:07] me means long you know it translates
[1:06:08] along with me but I want to try my best
[1:06:10] not to amen and uh maybe I should just
[1:06:13] cut it short and let's just have prayer
[1:06:14] meeting this morning

[1:08:41] years ago

[1:08:46] been when those cruel cruel Roman
[1:08:50] whips were lashing across his back
[1:08:56] brother Branham said there were pieces
[1:08:57] of Glass and Metal and everything else
[1:08:59] embedded in the tips of those whips and
[1:09:03] with every every lash that it would it
[1:09:05] would grab hold of a piece of Flesh and
[1:09:07] just Yank A chunk of that flesh out
[1:09:12] the scripture says that my bones they
[1:09:14] stare out at me right
[1:09:18] and with every lash that he was taking
[1:09:20] at that time
[1:09:22] he was taking it for you and me

[1:10:42] Genesis and for those of you who were
[1:10:43] not at last night's couple's banquet
[1:10:45] there I say back because I read from
[1:10:47] Genesis last night too
[1:10:49] um
[1:10:50] this is just such an awesome portion of
[1:10:53] scripture really here and God puts
[1:10:57] everything in its proper order right if
[1:11:00] you want to know what the proper order
[1:11:01] for God for God is go back to Genesis
[1:11:04] and look at it he shows you exactly what
[1:11:07] it is he puts everything in his proper
[1:11:08] order there and mercy me ain't that what
[1:11:10] this world needs today you know it needs
[1:11:13] to be it needs some order to things we
[1:11:16] need to order two things here we've
[1:11:18] we've sang this song for years I believe
[1:11:19] is what this world is falling apart you
[1:11:23] tell I'm not a singer I'm so glad I got
[1:11:25] Jesus down in my heart is that right and
[1:11:28] that's the truth this world has fallen
[1:11:30] apart but you know what we can look
[1:11:31] around now today more than ever you know
[1:11:33] and before I used to love to sing that
[1:11:35] song I can sing it better when I'm in my
[1:11:36] truck by myself and and you know I used
[1:11:38] to love to sing that song and we'd go
[1:11:40] through those things he said man it is
[1:11:42] everything's falling apart but you know
[1:11:43] the day that we're in right now we look
[1:11:45] at these things we think
[1:11:46] man it's shot
[1:11:48] you know I mean it's not just it is
[1:11:50] falling apart it has fallen apart right
[1:11:53] we look around now and no matter where
[1:11:55] you look at you no matter what you Turn
[1:11:56] Your Eyes Upon it has already fallen
[1:11:59] apart the politics are gone the
[1:12:01] education system's gone the medical
[1:12:04] system is gone the supply chains are
[1:12:06] broken right the minds of the people are
[1:12:09] broken the spirits of the people are
[1:12:11] broken that's even worse
[1:12:13] it takes a 399
[1:12:16] no 399 500 missile
[1:12:22] flying out of a 216 million dollar jet
[1:12:25] to bust a balloon
[1:12:30] I mean come on you know
[1:12:32] they they need to go see the mcculloughs
[1:12:34] down in down down in Macon
[1:12:37] we'd go down to their birthday parties
[1:12:39] and they'd let balloons loose and we'd
[1:12:40] all be sitting there go boom boom boom
[1:12:41] and blowing those balloons out you know
[1:12:43] with whatever you have
[1:12:45] they've shot more balloons down than I
[1:12:46] guess this government's ever done you
[1:12:48] know
[1:12:50] it was kind of exciting to watch it kind
[1:12:52] of go across the country though it was
[1:12:53] almost the most fun I've had since the
[1:12:54] O.J Simpson chase you know
[1:12:57] some of you are too old too young to get
[1:13:00] that
[1:13:01] some of us are too old to remember it
[1:13:05] good grief amen that's the state of
[1:13:07] things anyways
[1:13:08] I think we could stand a good old dose
[1:13:10] of God ordained order at least this time
[1:13:13] right now amen so anyways Genesis
[1:13:15] chapter two don't worry I'm not going to
[1:13:16] try to put everything back in order here
[1:13:18] this morning that would really take a
[1:13:19] long time here amen but uh
[1:13:22] hey just be sure though that the answers
[1:13:24] to put it all back in order and those
[1:13:25] those good old books you're holding in
[1:13:27] your hands right there right it's in
[1:13:29] those Bibles amen
[1:13:31] but I just thought again since this
[1:13:32] weekend you know I'm not going to try to
[1:13:34] do it all at one time but I just thought
[1:13:35] since this weekend is uh
[1:13:37] it was the couple's banquet and Tuesday
[1:13:40] is a holiday this this honoring some
[1:13:42] naked baby with wings doing flybys and
[1:13:45] shooting arrows you know and everything
[1:13:47] maybe I just take a thought this morning
[1:13:49] from Genesis where God put everything in
[1:13:51] place for the man and the woman you know
[1:13:53] the man and the woman here the man and
[1:13:54] his wife and the woman her husband
[1:13:57] and don't worry brother Wade I'm not
[1:13:58] gonna blow it up so bad that you gotta
[1:14:00] put everything back together I pray amen
[1:14:03] if I do then I will never be back but I
[1:14:06] don't want to make brother Wade mad
[1:14:07] because he's got to come back and preach
[1:14:09] for us again
[1:14:10] yeah I know I know
[1:14:12] so I'm going to title this this has
[1:14:13] already been up there for a while they
[1:14:14] twain shall be won before we read our
[1:14:16] scripture let's bow our heads right
[1:14:17] quick Heavenly Father dear God we love
[1:14:20] you this morning we love you with
[1:14:22] everything that we have in our hearts
[1:14:24] our hearts are full this morning dear
[1:14:25] God when we think of the goodness and
[1:14:27] the grace of the faithfulness Lord
[1:14:29] we think of the promises that you've
[1:14:31] give us Lord
[1:14:32] the prayers have been answered dear Lord
[1:14:34] Jesus and most of all dear God we think
[1:14:36] of the faith and the stand of the people
[1:14:38] here they couldn't do that if it were
[1:14:39] not for the Holy Ghost
[1:14:41] so Lord we just pray this morning that
[1:14:43] you would just that you would come
[1:14:45] amongst us Lord you're already here Lord
[1:14:47] but I pray that you would just just move
[1:14:48] amongst us in such a way dear God to to
[1:14:51] speak to our hearts to encourage us and
[1:14:53] help us Lord
[1:14:55] to do whatever needs to be done to do
[1:14:57] the Greater Works dear God that you
[1:14:59] promised that you would do Lord
[1:15:01] the Lord we thank you we pray that you
[1:15:02] take these words that I have Lord open
[1:15:05] them to our hearts Lord take the
[1:15:07] thoughts that are Upon My Heart Lord
[1:15:08] Jesus dear God and just deliver it in
[1:15:10] whichever way would seem pleasing to you
[1:15:12] let you speak the Lord
[1:15:15] in Jesus name we pray amen
[1:15:18] Genesis chapter 2 verse 21
[1:15:22] and the lord caught the Lord God calls
[1:15:24] the Deep Sleep to fall upon Adam and he
[1:15:26] slept and he took and he took one of his
[1:15:29] ribs and closed up the flesh instead
[1:15:32] thereof
[1:15:33] and here we see the great physician
[1:15:35] performed the world's first operation
[1:15:37] right the first surgery amen so verse 22
[1:15:41] and the rib which the Lord God had taken
[1:15:43] from the man made he a woman and brought
[1:15:46] her into the man and Adam said this is
[1:15:49] now bone of my bones and Flesh of My
[1:15:51] Flesh she shall be called woman because
[1:15:52] she was taken out of man
[1:15:55] therefore shall a man leave his father
[1:15:57] and his mother and shall cleave unto his
[1:16:00] wife and they shall be one flesh
[1:16:02] and they were both naked the man and his
[1:16:05] wife and they were not ashamed amen God
[1:16:07] bless you you may be seated here this
[1:16:10] morning amen
[1:16:11] so I want to start out just by looking
[1:16:13] at the uh
[1:16:15] looking at this scripture and
[1:16:19] looking at the the woman that came out
[1:16:22] of Adam
[1:16:23] or like I like to say sometimes looking
[1:16:25] at the whoa men that came out of Adam
[1:16:28] right
[1:16:29] I got in trouble for saying it that way
[1:16:31] one time years ago but the Whoa man that
[1:16:34] came out of Adam
[1:16:36] who is the spoken word Son of God right
[1:16:41] we know that it's true and and I say
[1:16:43] that he is
[1:16:45] the spoken word Son of God because Adam
[1:16:48] is eternal
[1:16:50] right he's Eternal yeah
[1:16:53] Adam was the first Earth the first
[1:16:55] Earthen vessel to have been filled with
[1:16:58] eternal life when this world was formed
[1:17:00] he is the first vessel flesh and blood
[1:17:03] vessel
[1:17:04] to have been filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:17:07] amen
[1:17:08] amen praise the Lord
[1:17:09] and the Bible tells us in Genesis
[1:17:11] chapter 2 that the Lord God formed his
[1:17:14] body
[1:17:15] Out of the Dust right
[1:17:18] and then he breathed the Breath of Life
[1:17:21] into his nostrils
[1:17:23] and he became a living Soul right amen
[1:17:27] Adam was not even called Adam until
[1:17:29] Genesis 2 when he was formed Out of the
[1:17:31] Dust which means red Ruddy you know that
[1:17:34] sort of thing it was a man that was
[1:17:35] there and that that vessel that vessel
[1:17:37] became the the the the the the holding
[1:17:40] Place amen it became the dwelling place
[1:17:42] for the life of God for the Breath of
[1:17:45] God
[1:17:46] that word breath there when you you
[1:17:48] break it down is a very simple word it
[1:17:50] means to to blow or to be blown
[1:17:53] is to cause to breathe out
[1:17:56] and also to give up life God gave up
[1:17:59] life listen to this now that don't mean
[1:18:01] that he did away with his life but he
[1:18:02] gave up life
[1:18:04] in order to be able to breathe it into
[1:18:07] the nostrils of Adam
[1:18:09] look at what he's done for you today
[1:18:12] look at the breath that he's put in you
[1:18:14] today
[1:18:15] for God so loved the world that he gave
[1:18:18] his only begotten son right amen
[1:18:21] yeah and he said he he breathed upon
[1:18:23] them right receive ye the Holy Ghost
[1:18:26] amen and so that's what that's what the
[1:18:28] word there literally to breathe means
[1:18:30] amen so so you know God breathed he he
[1:18:33] literally breathed into into the
[1:18:35] nostrils into this vessel he he blowed
[1:18:38] his breath into that don't tell me God's
[1:18:40] not real
[1:18:42] he's got breath right yeah he's got
[1:18:46] breath
[1:18:47] he can breathe there must be some lungs
[1:18:50] or something that can squish some breath
[1:18:51] out some way or another there was
[1:18:53] something that was that was placed into
[1:18:55] this into this vessel that we'd call
[1:18:57] Adam here
[1:18:58] correct
[1:19:00] and by the way again that word used for
[1:19:03] Life there he breathed the breath of
[1:19:04] life that word for use for Life there is
[1:19:07] the same word that God uses just two
[1:19:08] verses below there in verse nine it's
[1:19:11] the very same word that he uses there
[1:19:12] when he first speaks of the Tree of Life
[1:19:15] the first mentioned the first idea the
[1:19:18] first concept that Humanity has of
[1:19:20] something called the the tree of life
[1:19:22] amen and he takes that same life and he
[1:19:25] breathes it into that spoken word Son of
[1:19:28] God
[1:19:29] right
[1:19:33] like same life
[1:19:36] same life that was flowing through the
[1:19:37] tree life
[1:19:39] and we know who that tree of life is
[1:19:43] Jesus Christ is that tree of life it's
[1:19:46] Christ
[1:19:47] God
[1:19:50] and that same life that flowed through
[1:19:52] the Tree of Life In The Garden it's the
[1:19:53] same life which the Lord God breathed
[1:19:55] into Adam and then and that flesh and
[1:19:57] blood formation from the dust of the
[1:19:59] earth became a living Soul he was an
[1:20:02] eternal Soul which came forth from the
[1:20:04] life source of God himself
[1:20:07] come on now all right
[1:20:10] the same Life Source
[1:20:13] who is he's the word
[1:20:17] and Adam's a spoken word Son of God
[1:20:20] and that same spoken word Son of God or
[1:20:23] seed of God that was spoken Genesis 1 he
[1:20:26] placed there God said in Genesis chapter
[1:20:27] 1 verse 26 and 27 and God said let us
[1:20:30] make man in our image and after our
[1:20:33] likeness
[1:20:34] and let them have dominion over the fish
[1:20:36] of the sea and over the fowl of the air
[1:20:38] and over the cattle and over to all the
[1:20:40] Earth and over every creeping thing that
[1:20:41] creepeth upon the Earth so God created
[1:20:44] him in his own image in the image of God
[1:20:47] created he him male and female created
[1:20:50] he them is that right
[1:20:53] all right good and in the day that God
[1:20:55] created man in Genesis 1 in the day that
[1:20:58] God created man he created him male and
[1:21:01] female
[1:21:04] and they were created as we said last
[1:21:06] night as one unit
[1:21:08] one unit
[1:21:12] he was male
[1:21:14] she was female
[1:21:18] and they were one
[1:21:21] and there was no such thing as a wool
[1:21:23] man at the time of Genesis 1.
[1:21:26] until she came out of Adam
[1:21:29] and then when she came out of Adam oh
[1:21:30] boy we got a lot of whoa
[1:21:33] oh I'm going to get in trouble
[1:21:39] but hold on trust me here I'm not trust
[1:21:41] me I'm not a card-carrying member of the
[1:21:43] He-Man Woman Haters Club I am not you
[1:21:45] can ask my wife
[1:21:48] you know when we first got married
[1:21:51] we first got married oh my there's a lot
[1:21:53] of good stories
[1:21:56] yeah I think I think she left she has
[1:21:58] left the building
[1:22:00] when we first got married we you know
[1:22:03] actually let me back up even before we
[1:22:04] got married we were uh we were just

[1:22:22] like five months before we were so we
[1:22:24] were all pretty much learning at the
[1:22:26] same time
[1:22:28] you know and again it's all about this
[1:22:30] concept of unity of of they twain shall
[1:22:32] be won right and so so we go and and we
[1:22:34] sit down and and I'll just raise a
[1:22:36] little Methodist boy as I said last

[1:22:43] we did and and you know you just you're
[1:22:46] we were just out there and and but but
[1:22:48] you know there was something in my heart
[1:22:49] that God had been pulling along right
[1:22:51] and and my wife as I said last night
[1:22:53] again she was my end she was the one
[1:22:55] that witnessed to me and and gave me the
[1:22:57] opportunity to to hear the voice of God

[1:24:50] we had to learn you know there's a
[1:24:52] family we came together and we had to
[1:24:53] learn and this was a lesson for some
[1:24:55] maybe some of the younger ones here I
[1:24:56] don't know I see a lot of young faces
[1:24:57] here this morning
[1:25:00] you know perhaps you're thinking you

[1:25:19] turned 13 the day they turned 13 somehow
[1:25:22] between the night when we went to bed
[1:25:24] they were 12 years old and the morning
[1:25:25] when we woke up and they were 13
[1:25:27] somebody slipped in my house and they
[1:25:28] found a switch that I never could find
[1:25:30] and they flipped that switch and it was
[1:25:33] like the invasions of the Body Snatchers
[1:25:35] came in and they took my 12 year old
[1:25:38] girls and they placed something there I
[1:25:40] don't know what it was and man they were
[1:25:42] grown
[1:25:44] you're not going to tell me what to do
[1:25:48] you know it's lessons that you learn
[1:25:52] but as you're young the younger ones
[1:25:53] that are here and everything else don't
[1:25:54] get this idea in your head that you're
[1:25:56] going to listen I'm gonna go out I'm
[1:25:57] going to be I'm going to get married and
[1:25:59] and nobody's going to tell me what to do
[1:26:02] and and we're it's everything's gonna be
[1:26:04] easy and everything's gonna be wonderful
[1:26:08] and and you know I'm gonna get to eat
[1:26:10] all the ice cream that I want
[1:26:13] be careful you'll get a figure like mine
[1:26:15] if you do that
[1:26:18] I'm gonna be to do all these things like
[1:26:20] that but you know the thing of it is
[1:26:21] when we when we got together when we
[1:26:23] began dating and we we got you know we
[1:26:25] finally got married and everything else
[1:26:26] we I found that you know it's one thing
[1:26:29] when you're when you're one individual
[1:26:31] living under your parents house and
[1:26:32] you've got you you know the rules you
[1:26:35] might Buck the rules but you know the
[1:26:37] rules right
[1:26:38] you know what they are and they're there
[1:26:41] for a reason they are there's an order
[1:26:44] to things and it has to go a certain way
[1:26:47] right it has to go a certain way or
[1:26:49] there's chaos and God is not the author
[1:26:51] of Chaos
[1:26:53] so if what you're thinking and what
[1:26:54] you're going through is bringing chaos
[1:26:55] and everything in you need to realize
[1:26:57] listen this might not be from God
[1:27:00] God might not might not mean for me to
[1:27:02] go out and be a full-grown man when I'm
[1:27:04] 13 years old
[1:27:06] right
[1:27:07] he might not mean for me to be a
[1:27:09] full-grown woman when I'm 13 years old
[1:27:13] but there's an order
[1:27:16] there's an order that's taking place and
[1:27:18] after we you know when we came up we one
[1:27:20] thing I found was again we were taking a
[1:27:21] I was taking my life my life that had
[1:27:24] been raised up under my mom and dad and
[1:27:25] there was an order to things and and you
[1:27:27] know regardless whether I enjoyed all
[1:27:29] that order or not it was there yeah yeah
[1:27:32] but then but then you know then I come
[1:27:34] and again I find the the girl of my
[1:27:37] dreams and and we get married and but
[1:27:39] you know what she was raised up that's
[1:27:41] that and her in order too it was a
[1:27:43] different order than what my order was
[1:27:46] and the challenge was bringing these two
[1:27:49] lives together
[1:27:51] in such a way that it could produce
[1:27:54] something Godly amen and beautiful right
[1:27:58] useful
[1:27:59] something that has a purpose to it right
[1:28:02] because you say God always has a purpose
[1:28:04] if God's going to do something in your
[1:28:05] life there's a purpose for it right
[1:28:07] if you're going whatever it is that
[1:28:09] you're going through right now there's a
[1:28:11] purpose for it I know that's hard to say
[1:28:12] sometimes when we look and the pain and
[1:28:14] the hurt and the uncertainty and and
[1:28:16] life is you know life is it's not just
[1:28:18] rough life is terrible sometimes it's
[1:28:21] brutal right
[1:28:24] don't seem like there's an answer
[1:28:26] right it seems like it's full of chaos
[1:28:28] and pain and hurt and Terror and all the
[1:28:31] different things like that but I just
[1:28:32] want you to kind of step back and just
[1:28:34] realize that God is in control
[1:28:36] he is in control and there is a purpose
[1:28:40] he's actually bringing about an order to
[1:28:43] things
[1:28:44] right in order and as Christians
[1:28:48] we want God's order
[1:28:50] because we realize that God's will is
[1:28:52] best right God Knows Best
[1:28:55] God Knows Best
[1:28:57] and when it's his time for me to get out
[1:28:58] of here when it's his time when he's
[1:29:00] done with me that I'm ready for my my
[1:29:01] purpose is over I'm ready to go right I
[1:29:04] want to fulfill his purpose and I want
[1:29:05] to go home right
[1:29:08] but again I remember going through these
[1:29:10] things and trying to put all these
[1:29:11] things together and come under you know
[1:29:13] try to try to put things in in order in
[1:29:16] a seeming order that's there
[1:29:18] it's hard to do that
[1:29:21] you need the Lord
[1:29:23] you need the Holy Ghost
[1:29:24] this is hard to do that sometimes it's
[1:29:27] really really hard to do that sometimes
[1:29:28] you know I can imagine as I was trying
[1:29:30] or I don't have to imagine but I
[1:29:31] remember when we were trying to get
[1:29:32] things together before we were you know
[1:29:34] we were just fixing to be engaged we
[1:29:36] were just dating and everything else and
[1:29:38] I remember you know what the order I was
[1:29:40] seeing was that I was going to marry
[1:29:41] this beautiful lady and that we were
[1:29:44] going to go off into the sunset and it
[1:29:47] was going to be wonderful right there's
[1:29:48] not going to be any anything that's
[1:29:50] going to stand in our way hey the the
[1:29:52] sky's the limit right
[1:29:54] now I was working at a plant making like
[1:29:57] 200 a week
[1:29:59] and after we paid you after I paid
[1:30:01] everything I didn't have money for
[1:30:02] nothing but man it was going to be
[1:30:03] wonderful
[1:30:06] but there was a hurdle I had to pass I
[1:30:09] had to get over and that hurdle was her
[1:30:10] dad
[1:30:12] and I remember I remember going in and
[1:30:15] saying you know what I've got to ask for
[1:30:17] her hand in marriage I'll just
[1:30:18] old-fashioned enough to think that you
[1:30:19] still need to ask permission right
[1:30:22] now
[1:30:23] so I walked up to you one morning I got
[1:30:25] up she wasn't there I got up and we'd
[1:30:27] already discussed that I was going to
[1:30:28] talk to her dad and she was going to
[1:30:30] talk to her mom
[1:30:31] because I was more scared of her mom
[1:30:33] than I was her dad
[1:30:35] still am in a lot of ways
[1:30:39] but I remember I got up early and you
[1:30:41] know I worked second shift but I got up
[1:30:42] early one morning and it was a hot
[1:30:44] summer day and and I drove over to their
[1:30:46] house and I get out April's not even
[1:30:49] here I'm not even seeing her yet or
[1:30:50] anything wouldn't see her for the rest
[1:30:52] of the day after what I was about to do
[1:30:53] and so I go up you know I get out of the
[1:30:55] truck my whole truck and I walk up there
[1:30:57] and her dad I don't know if you know
[1:30:59] some of you know him some of you don't
[1:31:00] he he was about he was in his early 40s
[1:31:02] I think at the time and
[1:31:04] he was a man
[1:31:06] and I was not
[1:31:08] he was a mechanic he had these big old
[1:31:11] Popeye arms you know he was muscles he
[1:31:13] could pick up a a 350 and walk with it I
[1:31:16] mean the dude was a he was a horse he
[1:31:19] still is he's in better shape now than
[1:31:21] I've ever been in my life my shape is
[1:31:24] round he's still got he's still got a
[1:31:26] trim figure I don't know how he does it
[1:31:28] my wife's got good genes
[1:31:31] so I stepped out of the truck and the
[1:31:33] first thing he comes out of the shop and
[1:31:34] it's hot
[1:31:36] and he don't have his shirt on because
[1:31:38] he's working on the shop at home and
[1:31:40] there's nobody around and it's hot and
[1:31:42] he's so sweaty
[1:31:44] and those muscles are huge
[1:31:47] and I get to look into those hands
[1:31:49] I mean have you ever you know mechanics
[1:31:51] hands they're not like a normal person's
[1:31:52] hands mechanics and and concrete workers
[1:31:55] do not mess with those two individuals
[1:31:58] right I mean they got hands that could
[1:32:00] ring the bell on the whole world at one
[1:32:02] time I don't know what it is but and I
[1:32:04] walked up to him and I said I said well
[1:32:06] I'm here sir I'm here I'm gonna I'm
[1:32:08] gonna I need to I need to ask you
[1:32:09] something and he just looking at me like
[1:32:11] what is wrong with you boy
[1:32:13] and I said I I I wanna
[1:32:16] I wanna ask for for your your daughter's
[1:32:19] hand in marriage I want to marry April
[1:32:23] and he he just kind of stands there
[1:32:30] and the only word that comes out of his
[1:32:31] mouth is
[1:32:33] Mercy
[1:32:38] looking back I think he was praying that
[1:32:40] God would have mercy on me because he
[1:32:42] knew what he wanted to do right
[1:32:45] and he didn't say nothing else
[1:32:48] he didn't say anything else
[1:32:51] so I said finally I said now that I have
[1:32:54] ruined your day
[1:32:55] I'm going to get back in my truck and go
[1:32:58] home that's what I said I'm going to get
[1:32:59] back in my truck and go home and all he
[1:33:01] said I think it would be best
[1:33:03] and I hightailed it back to that truck
[1:33:05] and I'm here oh and I'm down the road
[1:33:07] April it's your turn you gotta go talk
[1:33:09] to your mama right
[1:33:12] but as I said last night I was
[1:33:14] persistent you know and we kept the
[1:33:16] course and and we finally we were
[1:33:18] married right we were married
[1:33:20] and I thought that was a big hurdle it
[1:33:21] was at the time but that was nothing to
[1:33:23] what was coming
[1:33:25] putting two pieces together
[1:33:29] we put our two little pieces together
[1:33:30] and
[1:33:32] her her brother and her sister and their
[1:33:34] their wives and their husbands they put
[1:33:35] their two little pieces together and
[1:33:36] then we tried to bring this whole family
[1:33:37] so now we had three or four families all
[1:33:39] coming together man you talk about some
[1:33:42] some hot nights on the back of the
[1:33:43] desert you know the brother Branham said
[1:33:45] Moses back there and his wife a
[1:33:46] hot-headed wife not saying my wife is
[1:33:48] hot headed don't take that wrong that
[1:33:50] came out wrong
[1:33:52] but just trying to put things together
[1:33:54] and make it work it was hard to do
[1:33:59] but I want to tell you it was worth it
[1:34:03] 34 years and three months today
[1:34:08] right
[1:34:10] we made it
[1:34:12] we made it
[1:34:16] I'm so glad that we make it
[1:34:21] there's a lot of work that goes into
[1:34:22] these things
[1:34:24] to bring two into into one
[1:34:28] in one relationship one bonding one they
[1:34:31] twang shall be one
[1:34:33] and you put these two things together
[1:34:35] and boy the fun times are on buddy
[1:34:37] right tough times Rough Waters
[1:34:40] decisions lots of discussions
[1:34:45] sometimes they get you know the voices
[1:34:47] get up a little bit and sometimes they
[1:34:48] come down a little bit
[1:34:52] sometimes this you know we we get these
[1:34:54] things and we put all this together and
[1:34:56] we call it this wonderful institution of
[1:34:59] marriage right
[1:35:02] and you know what it is wonderful yeah
[1:35:04] yeah it really is it's wonderful in the
[1:35:06] good times
[1:35:08] there's nothing like it when
[1:35:10] everything's going right
[1:35:12] yeah but you know what there's also
[1:35:14] definitely definitely nothing like it
[1:35:16] when things are not going right either
[1:35:17] amen
[1:35:19] and the Lord can bless that relationship
[1:35:27] 34 34 years or three months my goodness
[1:35:30] gracious
[1:35:31] we used to come with one of the lessons
[1:35:32] we used to have we used to come to a
[1:35:33] place and and us us people us men of the
[1:35:36] the Tatum Clan would joke and we'd say
[1:35:38] woman get in your place
[1:35:41] yeah you talk about for a smooth and
[1:35:44] righteous sell and that'll do it every
[1:35:45] time right
[1:35:47] we were kidding we really were kidding
[1:35:49] but there's nothing like that as a the
[1:35:51] the all arms start going off the blaring
[1:35:53] and everything all hands on deck
[1:35:56] I spurred directly ahead
[1:36:00] but we survived these things and again
[1:36:03] at the end I think that the success of
[1:36:04] our marriage has to do with us both it
[1:36:08] takes both one on one cannot do it alone
[1:36:13] and your brother's sitting here this
[1:36:15] this morning
[1:36:16] you need to be the husband that God
[1:36:18] meant for you to be
[1:36:20] I'm going to tell you a little bit here
[1:36:21] how to do that just just a little bit if
[1:36:23] this is okay but you need to be the
[1:36:25] husband that she needs you to be
[1:36:28] you're the one that said I do
[1:36:30] you did
[1:36:32] play time's over
[1:36:35] and sisters you got to be the wife that
[1:36:38] he needs you to be that God meant for
[1:36:40] you to be right
[1:36:42] not just that he wants you to be because
[1:36:44] sometimes us men we're stupid and we
[1:36:46] don't know what's best but you know God
[1:36:48] has a way and you as sisters you have a
[1:36:50] wisdom about you that sometimes a whole
[1:36:53] lot more than the men do about what
[1:36:54] needs to be done or what needs to be
[1:36:56] said
[1:36:57] I loved it last night one of the
[1:36:58] questions wait a minute I was told that
[1:37:00] what happened they were supposed to stay
[1:37:02] there
[1:37:04] well I'm going to anyways
[1:37:07] but I loved I loved it one of the
[1:37:09] questions there was who who is the more
[1:37:11] decisive one
[1:37:13] yes
[1:37:15] I'm just gonna go ahead and say it
[1:37:17] probably seven eights almost every one
[1:37:18] of them in there was saying her her her
[1:37:20] her I did too her
[1:37:24] yeah he'd say my goodness these bossy
[1:37:26] women
[1:37:28] no
[1:37:29] it's God puts away God put a wisdom in
[1:37:32] you
[1:37:33] right it takes both to work together
[1:37:35] right
[1:37:36] and God's able to do that and do that in
[1:37:39] such a way that the marriage works now
[1:37:41] I'm not telling you to be bossy women
[1:37:42] don't get me wrong
[1:37:44] but but you know the thing God puts this
[1:37:46] thing together so that it works
[1:37:48] amen and God God needs you to be the
[1:37:50] wife that God meant for you to be and
[1:37:53] sometimes it's to stand there and to
[1:37:54] make a decision and say you know what we
[1:37:56] need to pray more about this
[1:37:58] right maybe we need to pray more about
[1:38:00] this when the husband gets all excited
[1:38:02] about something we're going to go do
[1:38:03] this and we're going to go do that or I
[1:38:05] want this and I want that maybe the wife
[1:38:06] is the one that stands up and says whoa
[1:38:09] whoa right
[1:38:12] or it might be vice versa it could be
[1:38:14] the other way too and the woman but the
[1:38:16] the point I'm trying to make is it you
[1:38:18] need to be that spouse that God meant
[1:38:20] for you to be he gave us the order
[1:38:22] through his word
[1:38:24] they twang shall be one it takes one
[1:38:27] unit
[1:38:28] to make this thing work
[1:38:31] because if we if we go in too many times
[1:38:33] I used to work for my parents they had a
[1:38:35] they had a grocery store they had a
[1:38:37] convenience store sorry a convenience
[1:38:38] store with the gas pumps out front and
[1:38:40] these were you know this was the days
[1:38:42] when there was no such thing as self-pay
[1:38:45] I know some of you have never even lived
[1:38:46] in times when there was no self-pay it
[1:38:48] was all now I was all we I am young
[1:38:50] enough to say that the full service gas
[1:38:53] stations were almost gone at that time
[1:38:55] do you know there's places in the U.S
[1:38:57] you can go where they they have to be
[1:38:59] full stage yeah they have to there's
[1:39:00] it's against the law for you to pump
[1:39:01] your own gas
[1:39:02] New Jersey that's right
[1:39:04] I got out there as fast as I could
[1:39:12] but you would where was I going with
[1:39:14] that good grief
[1:39:16] but
[1:39:18] they did they did by the way they owned
[1:39:21] a convenience store
[1:39:23] and one thing I would see
[1:39:26] preach brother Wade
[1:39:29] one thing I would say is that people
[1:39:31] would come in you know this then they
[1:39:32] would come in they'd go up and you'd
[1:39:33] have your cars come in from two
[1:39:34] different directions and one pull up
[1:39:35] this side of the station the gas pump so
[1:39:37] this and pull up over here and the same
[1:39:38] gas pumps you know you got gas nozzles
[1:39:40] on both sides and they pull up like this
[1:39:41] and and so so the the man would get out
[1:39:44] and he'd get it say is put it in the
[1:39:45] tank and he's sitting there
[1:39:47] before cell phones too so you know they
[1:39:50] wasn't sitting here doing this number
[1:39:52] right that's what you do now right
[1:39:53] everybody gets at it when they're
[1:39:54] pumping gas they're doing this number
[1:39:55] when they're waiting in the line they're
[1:39:56] doing this number they're going down the
[1:39:58] road they're doing this number whatever
[1:39:59] and but they would sit there before that
[1:40:01] they would sit there at that tank and he
[1:40:03] would sit there and just kind of like
[1:40:05] and the wife and if you didn't know him
[1:40:08] you didn't know it was the wife
[1:40:09] but the the wife would be here on her
[1:40:11] car over here on this side facing him
[1:40:14] because you know they're they're like
[1:40:15] this so she's facing him going
[1:40:20] and it wasn't just they were mad it
[1:40:21] wasn't that they were mad you can tell
[1:40:22] when they get mad
[1:40:24] right you can tell when your spouse is
[1:40:26] mad and you can tell when somebody
[1:40:27] else's spouse is mad I know that look
[1:40:29] right but they you you there was no it
[1:40:34] was like there was no Community there
[1:40:35] was not even just no communication it's
[1:40:36] like they never they didn't even really
[1:40:38] know each other there was no
[1:40:39] relationship there there was nothing and
[1:40:41] they would put their gas in their
[1:40:43] nozzles back in the you know the tank
[1:40:44] when they're done and they'd come into
[1:40:46] the store one would walk behind the
[1:40:47] other just like strangers and they would
[1:40:49] come in there and they would wait in the
[1:40:51] line
[1:40:51] just like this he'd fiddle with
[1:40:53] something on the counter she'd fiddle
[1:40:54] with something over there he'd come up
[1:40:56] there he'd break his wallet out and he'd
[1:40:58] pay for the gas and he turned around and
[1:41:00] he'd walk out turn around and walk right
[1:41:02] past her and never even look at her and
[1:41:04] she would come up there and she would
[1:41:05] pay for her gas like that and she would
[1:41:07] turn around and follow him right out the
[1:41:08] door they would get in their cars and
[1:41:09] put them separate ways and I'd sit there
[1:41:11] and I'm thinking they're married
[1:41:16] they're married
[1:41:18] I didn't even know there was a scripture
[1:41:20] at the time saying that they twain shall
[1:41:22] be won I didn't know that I had never
[1:41:24] read that at that time
[1:41:25] but I knew something was off
[1:41:28] wouldn't you like to be in that house
[1:41:30] tonight no you talk about iceberg
[1:41:33] right
[1:41:36] but there was something that was missing
[1:41:37] and I tell you what that something
[1:41:39] that's missing and it's still missing
[1:41:40] for so many today is that it's that
[1:41:42] ability to let go of yourself to die to
[1:41:46] yourself and become one
[1:41:48] and become one this is kind of practical
[1:41:51] stuff we're talking about Valentine's
[1:41:53] Day right so it's a it's that ability to
[1:41:55] become one
[1:41:57] because without it the relationship just
[1:42:00] does not work
[1:42:04] the secret
[1:42:07] to a good marriage
[1:42:09] is first it takes both
[1:42:15] amen and the main secret to that is that
[1:42:17] both must know their positions in the
[1:42:19] one body
[1:42:22] that is who God created us to be
[1:42:25] the one body he created us to be one and
[1:42:28] I don't I'm not just you know I'm not
[1:42:30] I'm not taking that figuratively there
[1:42:32] it's a matter of speech no
[1:42:34] he said so God created Ant-Man in his
[1:42:38] own image in the image of God created he
[1:42:41] them male and female created he them
[1:42:44] and if you think there's two of them
[1:42:46] there
[1:42:47] just go over and read in Revelation
[1:42:49] Revelation where'd that come from
[1:42:50] Genesis and Revelation just go over and
[1:42:52] read in Genesis chapter 2 when God
[1:42:54] created Adam where we just read and he
[1:42:56] created him out the dust of the earth
[1:42:57] there was still just one you looked and
[1:42:59] you could only see one
[1:43:01] but there were two in that one right
[1:43:04] they were so much they were there were
[1:43:06] so much of two in that one
[1:43:08] that God had to put Adam into his sleep
[1:43:11] and sleep he did
[1:43:13] and then reach into his side
[1:43:16] I wonder how do you cut him open
[1:43:20] hmm probably just just think it's the
[1:43:23] way he just spoke
[1:43:25] God's light maybe he used laser surgery
[1:43:27] I don't know
[1:43:29] whatever how it was he reached inside
[1:43:31] and he took a rib out of his side and he
[1:43:34] closed up the flesh thereof right they
[1:43:36] were so much there was two in that one
[1:43:38] so much so that God could literally
[1:43:39] reach inside of him and pull the woman
[1:43:41] out amen
[1:43:43] come on brother that's right
[1:43:46] it's an amazing thing
[1:43:48] yeah it is an amazing thing
[1:43:54] and she became
[1:43:56] Whoa man yeah
[1:43:57] she became woman right
[1:43:59] she became woman
[1:44:02] they were created one then God separated
[1:44:05] them but I want you to notice this
[1:44:06] before the fall now I want you to notice
[1:44:08] something though that that even though
[1:44:10] with the rib being removed from his side
[1:44:12] from that there was a separation that
[1:44:14] took place between the male and the
[1:44:16] female there but I want to just point
[1:44:17] out again that separation did nothing to
[1:44:20] negate the truth that they were created
[1:44:22] one in the very beginning
[1:44:25] they had to be one there's a purpose for
[1:44:28] me saying this this morning there has to
[1:44:29] be that Union take place there's got to
[1:44:31] be a Oneness take place
[1:44:36] so amazing when I was when I first came
[1:44:38] into this message I remember reading a
[1:44:39] sermon or having questions about the
[1:44:41] Trinity and the godhead and all these
[1:44:43] things I may have said this here I say
[1:44:44] it a lot but but I remember you know
[1:44:46] what I wanted to understand what the
[1:44:47] godhead was I wanted to understand these
[1:44:49] things and you know I came from a
[1:44:50] trinitarian background but now here here
[1:44:52] we are in the message and brother Brad
[1:44:53] I'm talking about Oneness and
[1:44:54] everybody's talking about Oneness and I
[1:44:55] was just baptized in the name of the
[1:44:57] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:44:58] not in the father's Unholy ghost right
[1:45:01] and all these things come together and I
[1:45:02] believe that don't get me wrong I
[1:45:04] believe that I believe what my pastor
[1:45:05] told me I believe what I read in the
[1:45:07] books I believe what the Bible said but
[1:45:08] you know you're always you you just you
[1:45:10] won't understand right
[1:45:12] and then I I get this this sermon I pull
[1:45:15] up a book and this is before the
[1:45:16] computer days and I pull up and I found
[1:45:18] a book Oneness and I thought yes that's
[1:45:20] going to show me everything I need to
[1:45:22] know about that and I open up and I
[1:45:23] start reading
[1:45:25] and I was floored flummoxed
[1:45:29] what I don't know what do you call just
[1:45:31] a shot he was not talking about the
[1:45:33] Trinity nearly so much as he was talking
[1:45:36] about the Oneness between the bride and
[1:45:38] her husband Jesus Christ
[1:45:41] the Oneness of the godhead and he was
[1:45:43] taking me and he was putting me in that
[1:45:46] godhead
[1:45:48] and I thought Lord have mercy
[1:45:50] what have I missed my whole life
[1:45:54] right what have I missed
[1:45:56] and look at it I could say this is
[1:45:58] awesome
[1:46:00] this is wonderful stuff
[1:46:03] right
[1:46:05] so so when Adam and Eve when they're
[1:46:07] separated at that time remember now
[1:46:08] before the fall that they were still it
[1:46:11] did nothing that separation did nothing
[1:46:13] to negate the truth that they were
[1:46:15] created one in the beginning that was
[1:46:16] still there that Oneness was the truth
[1:46:19] according to God's word and I'm just
[1:46:21] going to go ahead and tell you this
[1:46:22] morning I might get out there just a
[1:46:24] little bit here in a second but I really
[1:46:25] believe that Oneness still exists
[1:46:28] [Music]
[1:46:29] and for true happiness in the in in the
[1:46:32] marriage you must find that Unity again
[1:46:37] you've got to come back to that Genesis
[1:46:39] 1 Unity
[1:46:42] right
[1:46:43] Genesis 2 24 therefore shall a man leave
[1:46:45] his father and mother and shall cleave
[1:46:47] unto his wife and they shall be one
[1:46:49] flesh
[1:46:51] Jesus said in Matthew chapter 19
[1:46:55] have you not read
[1:46:57] that he which made them at the beginning
[1:46:59] made them male and female
[1:47:01] and said for this call shall a man leave
[1:47:04] father and mother and shall cleave to
[1:47:05] his wife and they twain shall be one
[1:47:08] flesh
[1:47:09] wherefore they are no more Twain but one
[1:47:13] flesh
[1:47:14] what therefore God hath joined together
[1:47:17] let no man put asunder right
[1:47:22] I think the problem today
[1:47:26] and we see it all over you used to be
[1:47:28] the problem that you would see outside
[1:47:29] the message ranks
[1:47:30] but we see it a lot in the message ranks
[1:47:32] now too
[1:47:34] but I think the problem today
[1:47:36] that we see way too too many times
[1:47:39] is that there are far too many marriages
[1:47:41] that have never truly been joined
[1:47:43] together I don't care what the preacher
[1:47:46] said
[1:47:47] I don't care how long the honeymoon was
[1:47:50] they have never joined together
[1:47:53] the two remain two separate individuals
[1:47:56] right through the fall that's what
[1:47:59] happened the they were they had before
[1:48:01] the fall they were they were they were
[1:48:03] Twain amen after the father came a
[1:48:05] separation there was sin separated there
[1:48:07] amen
[1:48:09] I praise the Lord
[1:48:10] God's able to heal things
[1:48:13] God's able to put stuff back together
[1:48:16] God's able to fix marriages
[1:48:18] God's able to blend a relationship back
[1:48:21] together amen
[1:48:22] if he was not able to do that I
[1:48:24] guarantee you it would be a much worse
[1:48:26] world than it is right now thank God for
[1:48:28] True Christians that can stand up for a
[1:48:30] word of God Amen
[1:48:32] but the problem is is that people have
[1:48:34] not joined together
[1:48:38] they've not really United they've
[1:48:40] remained two individuals instead of
[1:48:42] coming together as that one that God saw
[1:48:45] and spoke them to be before the
[1:48:46] foundation of the world
[1:48:48] and the woman has a hard time coming
[1:48:51] under the headship of the man
[1:48:53] and losing her own fleshly identity
[1:48:57] and truly taking on his name his
[1:48:59] identity
[1:49:00] now I don't know you folks some of you
[1:49:02] folks and if I say something it might
[1:49:04] kind of step on your toes I'm sorry here
[1:49:06] but one of the things that just gripes
[1:49:07] me to know in
[1:49:09] is to see these newfangled marriages
[1:49:11] yeah where the where the woman will not
[1:49:13] take the man's name
[1:49:15] or it's a hyphenated name yeah
[1:49:19] call me old-fashioned I don't care I'm
[1:49:21] old enough to not care right
[1:49:25] if she's not if she's if she's holding
[1:49:27] on to enough identity up from her past
[1:49:29] life she can that she will not surrender
[1:49:32] her last name
[1:49:34] then she is not she is not going to join
[1:49:37] she's not going to be able to adequately
[1:49:39] join
[1:49:41] this is just practical stuff brother
[1:49:42] wait I'm sorry but it's just you're not
[1:49:44] going to be able to just add
[1:49:46] adequately no that's a tongue twister if
[1:49:48] you've got a tongue from Plainville
[1:49:49] adequately
[1:49:52] join together amen and be the kind of
[1:49:55] husband or wife that you're supposed to
[1:49:58] be
[1:49:58] I was told a while back said well you
[1:50:00] know in some places overseas the man
[1:50:02] takes the wife's wife's name
[1:50:05] and it's true
[1:50:07] and I said but they ain't Christian
[1:50:09] right
[1:50:10] and I don't care if they do or they
[1:50:12] don't or whatever I don't want to
[1:50:13] identify with that I identify with the
[1:50:15] Bible
[1:50:16] I identify as a Christian I'm a
[1:50:18] Christian it's not even an American
[1:50:19] thing or a western thing or this thing
[1:50:21] or that I'm a Christian it's a Bible
[1:50:23] thing
[1:50:24] and the woman is supposed to yield up
[1:50:26] surrender her identity to her husband
[1:50:29] it's called headship
[1:50:31] and the problem is is that they don't
[1:50:33] that the Lots will not come under that
[1:50:35] headship now I'm not just talking about
[1:50:37] the women because the problem I see too
[1:50:38] is the men will go many times and they
[1:50:41] will not yield up their identity you say
[1:50:43] wait a minute I'm the man I'm in control
[1:50:45] listen he took her it took the rib out
[1:50:47] of the side
[1:50:48] not the bone out of the foot
[1:50:51] right
[1:50:53] well she's got to do what I say
[1:50:56] no she won't with that attitude
[1:50:59] or if she does you better watch out
[1:51:01] there's going to be something in your
[1:51:03] food
[1:51:04] and you've got to go to sleep sometime
[1:51:07] right
[1:51:10] he said oh she's so Meek and timid she
[1:51:11] would never do something like that you'd
[1:51:13] be surprised
[1:51:16] humans are ingenious things
[1:51:19] they'll figure out a way to get you back
[1:51:21] right
[1:51:24] just smile all along yes my Lord
[1:51:28] yes my Lord
[1:51:32] oh my
[1:51:35] God it's a it's a lack of ability to
[1:51:38] I'll tell you what it is it's
[1:51:39] selfishness
[1:51:41] I mean just be plain spoken in
[1:51:43] selfishness you know
[1:51:46] I know in 2023 that sounded like an
[1:51:49] outdated narrow-minded hateful position
[1:51:51] to take but it's the truth
[1:51:54] times have changed but the word of God
[1:51:56] has not
[1:51:59] there could be many reasons there's
[1:52:01] really there's a lot of reasons for this
[1:52:03] lack of unity there you know the fear of
[1:52:04] losing one's individual identities as we
[1:52:07] said I'm my own person
[1:52:11] but what Satan hides are and he's really
[1:52:13] good at hiding things but what Satan
[1:52:15] hides here is the fact that neither the
[1:52:18] man nor the woman can ever truly know
[1:52:20] their God given their full god-given
[1:52:24] identities and Freedoms
[1:52:28] because man there is nothing like the
[1:52:30] freedom that comes with having the right
[1:52:32] kind of relationship with your wife or
[1:52:35] your husband
[1:52:36] there's nothing like the freedom that
[1:52:38] comes with that
[1:52:40] I can go home and I can just open myself
[1:52:43] up
[1:52:44] I can unburden myself from the day not
[1:52:46] that I just want to go dump on my wife
[1:52:48] at the end of the day I don't do that
[1:52:49] but at the same time I'm able to talk
[1:52:51] about open up share my feelings share my
[1:52:53] love everything else and it's just it's
[1:52:55] a freeing thing if I had to carry
[1:52:58] everything by myself I would be a
[1:53:00] miserable human being
[1:53:02] and to be honest with you I don't think
[1:53:04] I'm strong enough to carry it all by
[1:53:05] myself
[1:53:07] I don't think I am
[1:53:09] I think I'd be so overwhelmed and listen
[1:53:11] guys do not take your wife for granted
[1:53:15] God give you the best thing he could
[1:53:17] give you outside of Salvation when he
[1:53:19] gave you a wife
[1:53:20] right
[1:53:22] a Godly wife
[1:53:25] don't take it for granted
[1:53:30] Satan is so good at hiding that though
[1:53:32] and saying well you know you're gonna if
[1:53:34] you do that if you if you have that
[1:53:36] attitude or if you think about it this
[1:53:37] way if you you know whatever it might be
[1:53:39] if you go by the word of God if you do
[1:53:40] this you're you're not going to even be
[1:53:42] a person anymore
[1:53:48] he robs them of that blessing of they
[1:53:51] twain shall be won
[1:53:52] robs him of it I mean he just reaches
[1:53:55] down there and snatches it right out of
[1:53:56] him
[1:53:57] too many times he puts a line such a way
[1:53:59] that they can they'll just freely give
[1:54:01] it over
[1:54:02] right
[1:54:03] but God said he made you male and female
[1:54:06] he made you one Yes Man
[1:54:09] now I'm talking about marriage here
[1:54:10] obviously I'm talking about marriage
[1:54:12] here this morning and I know according
[1:54:13] to to Paul that marriage is not for
[1:54:15] everyone he he did say that he plainly
[1:54:18] said that in his opinion it was better
[1:54:20] if you stayed as he was right as he was
[1:54:24] but then he turned around and said but
[1:54:26] not many can do that
[1:54:29] and it's better to marry than to burn
[1:54:32] that's not the reason you get married
[1:54:34] but it's better to marry than to burn
[1:54:38] the problem though again is that they
[1:54:40] never
[1:54:41] they never truly the problem is they
[1:54:43] never truly die to themselves and
[1:54:44] they're they're
[1:54:45] selfish natures and all these things in
[1:54:48] order to advance the cause and the
[1:54:50] purpose of the family unit
[1:54:53] the family unit must come first there
[1:54:56] must be a true Union take place for
[1:54:57] everything to work right and again that
[1:54:59] so far here I've been just talking about
[1:55:01] marriage relationships that it's not
[1:55:03] just the natural marriage relationship
[1:55:04] here but this is a type of a
[1:55:06] relationship with our husband
[1:55:08] with the Lord Jesus Christ right we are
[1:55:11] his bride
[1:55:13] amen and through the marriage Union of
[1:55:15] the baptism of the Holy Ghost for this
[1:55:17] day through the bonds of holy matrimony
[1:55:20] to the Lord Jesus Christ we have become
[1:55:22] wife
[1:55:26] in every sense of the word
[1:55:29] Ephesians chapter 5 verse 22 says wives
[1:55:32] submit yourselves unto your own husbands
[1:55:34] as unto the Lord
[1:55:40] have your way Lord right amen
[1:55:43] for the husband is the head of the wife
[1:55:44] even as Christ is the head of the church
[1:55:46] and he is the savior of the body
[1:55:47] therefore as the church is subject unto
[1:55:50] Christ so let the wives be to their own
[1:55:51] husbands and everything husbands love
[1:55:53] your wives and I pointed out last night
[1:55:56] that word love there that's a special
[1:55:58] word that word there husband love your
[1:56:00] wives That's not the Greek word Eros
[1:56:02] which is a lustful word it's the lower
[1:56:04] the lowest form but the lowest form of
[1:56:06] love that there can be Eros
[1:56:10] and he did not say husbands filio your
[1:56:13] wives That's to have an affection for
[1:56:14] you know I kind of like her
[1:56:17] she cooks really good
[1:56:20] since I've been married I put on 80
[1:56:21] pounds
[1:56:23] my wife can cook
[1:56:27] she gets it from her mama
[1:56:32] honey I feel you owe you
[1:56:37] I love how it feels to sit up pull up to
[1:56:39] the table and be able to you know just
[1:56:41] just eat to you know my heart's content
[1:56:44] I have affection for you you're so
[1:56:47] pretty you know
[1:56:50] and all that may be true there's nothing
[1:56:51] wrong with that that's true but that's
[1:56:54] not what what God is commanding us here
[1:56:55] that's not what Jesus is saying he's
[1:56:57] saying husband loves your wife and it's
[1:56:59] the word it's the Greek word agape
[1:57:02] yeah I'm probably not putting enough oil
[1:57:03] to that or oh or something to that but
[1:57:05] of the GoPro that's my playable Greek
[1:57:09] and Agape means according to the prophet
[1:57:11] he said it's not filio
[1:57:13] he said we're talking about the love of
[1:57:15] God right
[1:57:17] so husbands agapo your wives
[1:57:22] love her just as Christ loves his church

[1:59:02] that he might present it to himself a
[1:59:04] glorious church not having spot or a
[1:59:05] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[1:59:07] should be holy and without blemish I

[1:59:26] when you walk the streets when you go to
[1:59:28] Walmart I used to say you know I used to
[1:59:30] say all the time when you go through
[1:59:31] that Walmart or cashier and you and
[1:59:34] everything they don't have those anymore
[1:59:35] right now you're just in this big thing
[1:59:37] and you're having to do it all yourself
[1:59:38] and then they got the audacity to check

[1:59:42] you did it right when you get to the
[1:59:43] door listen Bob if you're not going to

[1:59:55] Walmart or Home Goods or tarsier or
[1:59:58] wherever it is that you like to shop we
[2:00:00] heard a lot of that last night
[2:00:02] even Amazon somehow I figured that one
[2:00:04] out see I'm old school still yeah
[2:00:07] I'm afraid if I ordered through Amazon
[2:00:08] it ain't going to fit yeah
[2:00:10] you know
[2:00:11] I'm not going to like it
[2:00:14] I ordered a kit one time on Amazon it

[2:00:17] was a wall you remember back in 2020 19
[2:00:19] whatever it was and the trumps thing
[2:00:21] would build the wall
[2:00:23] and everybody boy everybody yeah yeah
[2:00:25] yeah you know all this kind of stuff and
[2:00:26] I did it as a joke with a little a
[2:00:28] little party gift to give to to my
[2:00:30] nephew or different ones I thought this
[2:00:31] is going to be such a hit and the other
[2:00:33] pitcher had this this wall the Lego wall
[2:00:35] and Trump with his big hair and
[2:00:37] everything else and I ordered that thing

[2:00:40] thing and when it came in it was in a
[2:00:43] box this big
[2:00:48] and I was like I I sent them an email I
[2:00:51] have been gypped
[2:00:53] Trump is a Salesman but you guys ripped
[2:00:55] me off you know the blocks were like you
[2:00:58] know the smaller than the size of my
[2:00:59] pinky nail
[2:01:03] but don't you know that when you go to
[2:01:05] these different places I know I get
[2:01:07] sidetracked way too easy but when you go
[2:01:08] to these places and and you're walking
[2:01:10] through the you're wherever it might be
[2:01:12] in the workplace or here or there and
[2:01:14] all these things and you're walking and
[2:01:15] people are looking at you and you're
[2:01:17] you're Heavenly bridegroom your heavenly

[2:01:33] there's none like her she's beautiful
[2:01:35] she's gorgeous this is the it's
[2:01:39] everything I have to have thought about
[2:01:40] everything I have created everything I
[2:01:42] have done is wrapped up in this one this
[2:01:45] one this not an individual this one unit
[2:01:48] this one relationship this one bride
[2:01:50] this one wife right hallelujah amen
[2:01:53] that's who you are and he looks at you
[2:01:55] and he's just so proud of that amen
[2:01:57] that's right
[2:01:59] sometimes he sends you to the doctor's
[2:02:01] office to put his
[2:02:04] Union his Oneness on display
[2:02:07] sometimes he puts you in an MRI machine
[2:02:13] sometimes he sometimes he puts you in an
[2:02:15] oncologist office right
[2:02:21] what is he doing he's putting you on
[2:02:23] display
[2:02:24] because you're his wife
[2:02:26] can you just imagine what it must have
[2:02:28] been for job
[2:02:29] oh Lord I'm going to I'm about to be
[2:02:31] careful I'm just I won't finish and
[2:02:33] y'all just go eat
[2:02:37] there ain't no finishing that's the
[2:02:38] problem
[2:02:42] see he told me to
[2:02:45] can you just imagine what it was for job
[2:02:48] I mean we think of hard times
[2:02:50] I mean there's some pretty hard times
[2:02:53] but I mean you know when people go
[2:02:54] bankrupt and man I've seen people go
[2:02:56] bankrupt by the Lord's Grace I've never
[2:02:57] had to go bankrupt I've got really close
[2:03:00] we used to come through our through our
[2:03:01] years and I'd have after I paid my bills
[2:03:04] I had nine dollars to put gas in the
[2:03:06] tank that wouldn't work today nine
[2:03:07] dollars put gas in the tank and buy some
[2:03:09] hot dogs or a bag of potatoes or
[2:03:11] whatever for us to live on the rest of
[2:03:12] the week
[2:03:14] and we made it we did it
[2:03:16] we ate a lot of of homemade fries fried
[2:03:19] Eddie fries and and Polish sausages they
[2:03:21] were cheap back then you get a bag of
[2:03:24] five pound bag of potatoes that last you
[2:03:25] about all week long
[2:03:27] for a buck fifty
[2:03:32] yeah no wonder I put on 80 pounds and I
[2:03:33] think about it that way
[2:03:41] can you imagine though I mean here's job
[2:03:43] and and job goes through these things
[2:03:45] and and and and he loses he loses all
[2:03:49] his you know his cows are gone his his
[2:03:51] camels are gone his sheep are gone he
[2:03:53] loses everything
[2:03:56] that's that's enough to take a family
[2:03:58] down but you know it just stops there
[2:03:59] didn't it
[2:04:01] and then he lost his kids
[2:04:05] he lost his reputation
[2:04:09] his friends came so-called friends came
[2:04:11] they turned their back to him wouldn't
[2:04:12] even talk to him for seven days and then
[2:04:14] when they finally did start talking to
[2:04:16] him oh my goodness the the vitriol the
[2:04:18] vial that was coming out of their mouths
[2:04:21] you're a secret sinner we knew it all
[2:04:23] along well just it was the you could
[2:04:25] tell it was just the jealousy that was
[2:04:27] in them
[2:04:28] absolutely right his own wife literally
[2:04:30] almost verbatim almost verbatim quoted
[2:04:35] Satan back to job
[2:04:37] Satan had stood before God and and
[2:04:39] talking about putting on display it
[2:04:41] wasn't that Satan came up and said hey
[2:04:43] there's a man down there you got a hedge
[2:04:45] built around and I think I should be
[2:04:46] able to get to him that ain't what he
[2:04:48] said he comes up and and God just says
[2:04:51] oh catch me oh where you been
[2:04:53] what are you doing
[2:04:55] have you have you considered my servant
[2:04:57] job
[2:04:58] now we would think
[2:05:00] hush don't do that
[2:05:03] don't spring my name up
[2:05:06] but you see God had so much confidence
[2:05:08] so much love that Union was so he knew
[2:05:10] that he could trust job there was a
[2:05:13] union that had taken place and he put
[2:05:15] him in the hardest of places the hardest
[2:05:17] of conditions amen all at one time
[2:05:20] because he knew what God what what job
[2:05:22] was capable of even when job didn't know
[2:05:25] what he was capable of God knew what he
[2:05:27] was capable of right
[2:05:29] he knew what he had in him
[2:05:32] have you considered my servant job off
[2:05:36] you won't let me at him he's privileged
[2:05:39] yeah he's got privilege he's got this
[2:05:42] he's got a hedge built around him he's
[2:05:44] got all the different things and God
[2:05:45] says okay
[2:05:47] I'll show you I'll take the Hedge away
[2:05:50] have at him and job gets down to the
[2:05:52] place we know the story gets down to the
[2:05:54] place he's on the ash sheep he's
[2:05:55] scraping his boils and everything else
[2:05:57] he's lost everything he's wailing don't
[2:05:59] get me wrong Joe wants some superhuman
[2:06:01] that's sitting there saying ah God's got
[2:06:03] this he's in control that wasn't job at
[2:06:06] all he was human just like me and you
[2:06:08] and literally job's own wife turns to
[2:06:11] him and says why don't you curse God and
[2:06:14] die that's almost exactly what Satan
[2:06:16] told told God Satan took to him he said
[2:06:18] if you were to take that hedge off and
[2:06:20] you let me touch him let me get a hold
[2:06:22] of him he'll curse you to your face
[2:06:25] and here's his wife saying why don't you
[2:06:27] curse God and die
[2:06:30] shows where her inspiration came from
[2:06:33] that was not a Godly wife being
[2:06:34] represented there
[2:06:36] yeah
[2:06:38] a Godly wife would have been falling on
[2:06:39] her knees and praying with her husband
[2:06:41] at that time right amen
[2:06:44] so but job but job stood there and that
[2:06:46] was all because God had put him on
[2:06:48] display I preached a message one time
[2:06:50] called God's display case
[2:06:52] we think oh that's where you put your
[2:06:54] grandma's China and that's where you put
[2:06:56] your your great Grandmama's silverware
[2:06:58] and this and that and the little
[2:07:00] knickknacks that you collect that your
[2:07:02] kids give you and everything all these
[2:07:03] things that you want to put on display
[2:07:05] for for whoever comes into your house
[2:07:07] that you invite in your house you want
[2:07:08] to be able to display that and say look
[2:07:10] this this was special to me this is this
[2:07:14] is not just something that stuck back in
[2:07:15] the drawer this is something that's
[2:07:17] special to me oh you're special to him
[2:07:19] Saints
[2:07:21] and then he takes him and he puts it up
[2:07:23] there in the display case but God's
[2:07:24] display case is not like our display
[2:07:26] case and God in your iron display case
[2:07:28] except for the stuff that we don't want
[2:07:29] nobody to touch God sits there and says
[2:07:31] touch them
[2:07:33] kick them
[2:07:35] bite them
[2:07:36] custom
[2:07:38] tear them tear their hearts out of them
[2:07:43] tear their everything but their soul you
[2:07:46] just can't touch their life you can
[2:07:47] touch their mind you can touch their
[2:07:49] body you can touch their Spirit even you
[2:07:52] can break their Spirit even
[2:07:54] sure yes all right
[2:07:57] hey man but there's something inside of
[2:07:59] you
[2:08:01] Satan can't get a hold of
[2:08:04] Hallelujah
[2:08:06] it's a seed of God it was predestinated
[2:08:08] before the foundation of the world
[2:08:11] to believe his word because God said in
[2:08:13] the beginning he created them as one
[2:08:15] one
[2:08:17] for a part of him in the beginning you
[2:08:19] were one
[2:08:21] and if you were there in the beginning
[2:08:22] you'll be there in the ending right
[2:08:25] praise the Lord Jesus amen praise the
[2:08:28] Lord Jesus
[2:08:30] oh my
[2:08:34] God husbands love your wives
[2:08:37] he presents it to himself a glorious
[2:08:38] church not having spotted a wrinkle or
[2:08:40] any such thing but then it should be
[2:08:41] holy and without blemish so ought men to
[2:08:43] love their wives as their own bodies
[2:08:44] that he that loveth his wife loveth
[2:08:45] himself for no man ever hated his own
[2:08:48] flesh but nourisheth and cherished in it
[2:08:50] even as the Lord the church for we are
[2:08:52] members of his body of his flesh and of
[2:08:54] his bones bone of his bones and flesh of
[2:08:57] his flesh is that right for this call
[2:08:59] shall a man leave his father and his
[2:09:00] mother and shall be joined into his wife
[2:09:02] and they too shall be one flesh this is
[2:09:05] a great mystery
[2:09:07] but I speak concerning Christ in the
[2:09:10] church I guarantee you this is not just
[2:09:12] a church-going experience this is not a
[2:09:14] Pew sitting experience this is not
[2:09:16] something to where somebody just gets oh
[2:09:18] I've read a few books or something like
[2:09:19] that I've got some ideas
[2:09:23] I tell you I think some of the hardest
[2:09:25] sermons I've ever preached
[2:09:27] was when there was this one particular
[2:09:29] individual that would come visit with
[2:09:31] his soon-to-be wife at the time
[2:09:34] and he had he had read he had studied
[2:09:36] Buddhism he had studied Shamanism he had
[2:09:40] studied the Catholics he had started the
[2:09:42] Protestants the Pentecostals he had
[2:09:43] studied uh Hinduism he had studied I
[2:09:46] mean he got smart he's super smart he
[2:09:49] had all these things going through his
[2:09:50] head and Islam and all the things going
[2:09:52] through his head
[2:09:53] and he didn't he didn't believe any of
[2:09:55] it
[2:09:56] and he'd sit there in that church in my
[2:09:59] church and he'd sit there and he'd
[2:10:00] listen to me preach and I'd preached to
[2:10:02] who wouldn't have it but it just seemed
[2:10:03] like it wasn't going nowhere it made it
[2:10:05] so hard those are some of the hardest
[2:10:06] sermons I ever preached because it just
[2:10:08] it was just the man thought he knew
[2:10:09] enough there was no way that you could
[2:10:11] get to the man
[2:10:15] because you see he was so full of
[2:10:18] himself
[2:10:22] there's a reason he said let us be
[2:10:23] living sacrifices
[2:10:25] remember
[2:10:26] oh it's a mystery all right yeah
[2:10:29] it's a great mystery
[2:10:32] it's a mystery that Satan with all his
[2:10:33] lies and his lustful Spirits is covered
[2:10:35] over and buried very well today amen
[2:10:38] very well
[2:10:41] but God wants us to be one
[2:10:46] even as we sit down here and Satan's
[2:10:48] Eden
[2:10:49] and we can definitely say we are the
[2:10:50] wool man
[2:10:52] we've got a lot of whoa that we go
[2:10:54] through
[2:10:54] right we've got a lot of that stuff that
[2:10:56] we have to face fights or battles we
[2:10:57] have to fight all these different things
[2:10:59] amen that's the truth
[2:11:01] man
[2:11:04] but you gotta understand you got to
[2:11:05] remember you were taken out of his side
[2:11:11] the woman was taken out of the side of
[2:11:14] her spoken word husband
[2:11:17] Hallelujah
[2:11:18] praise the Lord the woman came out of
[2:11:20] the side
[2:11:22] of the spoken word Son of God
[2:11:24] the second Adam
[2:11:27] right amen he said it's necessary that I
[2:11:30] go
[2:11:31] it's necessary that I do this for if I
[2:11:33] don't go you can't come where I am
[2:11:35] there had to come a there had to come a
[2:11:37] separation even from that they had to
[2:11:39] come in Separation The Bride had to be
[2:11:41] pulled out
[2:11:45] she came out from that Riven side of
[2:11:48] Jesus Christ and as that blood and water
[2:11:50] poured out of that precious body there
[2:11:52] was a life given to the Bride of Jesus
[2:11:55] Christ and through that life we can find
[2:11:57] our
[2:11:59] true Oneness in him
[2:12:01] ain't that something that had to come
[2:12:02] out of his side so that we could go back
[2:12:04] into him right
[2:12:06] what a paradox
[2:12:09] he'd have to go to the cross and die and
[2:12:12] go through all these things and and
[2:12:13] literally have that life the life
[2:12:15] remember all he was the fullness of the
[2:12:17] godhead bodily it was dwelling within
[2:12:18] him that God seed that God life was held
[2:12:21] within that blood cell the life was in
[2:12:23] the blood and it was in there but for
[2:12:25] but for us to truly be able to come back
[2:12:27] and be one with him it had to be set
[2:12:29] loose
[2:12:33] there's a saying what if you love
[2:12:35] something let it go right
[2:12:37] if you love something let it go
[2:12:41] I'll pick up my little niece here well
[2:12:43] we got I've got this this gorgeous
[2:12:44] little great niece and you just want to
[2:12:45] pick her up I could just scream
[2:12:48] just go out there you know she's so cute
[2:12:53] after a while she's gonna have to get up
[2:12:54] and she's gonna have to go on her own
[2:12:55] and express who she is and that's what
[2:12:57] God knew he had to set you free so you
[2:12:58] could express who you are in him
[2:13:03] he gave you the ability to express Jesus
[2:13:06] Christ the same yesterday today and
[2:13:07] forever
[2:13:11] across the mystery brother Brandon said
[2:13:12] now you see the secret
[2:13:14] what two
[2:13:16] to restore Fallen Eve sorry Brothers I
[2:13:19] didn't get you that quote
[2:13:22] the secret what to to restore Fallen Eve
[2:13:25] as she was a free figure of the church
[2:13:29] and now notice as God opened up the side
[2:13:31] of Adam and took out Eve by his own
[2:13:33] flesh and blood and divided his Spirit
[2:13:35] from masculine and feminist to feminist
[2:13:38] and he put it in eve took the rip from
[2:13:40] under his side and made Eve out of it so
[2:13:42] God did the same thing taking out of the
[2:13:44] sight of Christ the blood and the water
[2:13:46] and Christ is the word
[2:13:49] and taking the word and making up his
[2:13:51] church Eve see back to himself again
[2:13:54] Redeemed by the blood that was come from
[2:13:56] his body you see it now God's great
[2:13:59] mystery being unfolded that's been hit
[2:14:01] since the foundation of the world but
[2:14:04] prefigured it all the way down through
[2:14:06] Ain't That Wonderful Paul said it's a
[2:14:08] great mystery it's a great mystery
[2:14:12] and here in this day we have a prophet
[2:14:13] comes and he says oh you see it now
[2:14:15] God's great mystery being unfolded
[2:14:18] that's been hid since the foundation of
[2:14:20] the world but prefigured all the way
[2:14:22] down through Hallelujah
[2:14:25] and glory to God
[2:14:27] the way was made through the death of
[2:14:29] Jesus
[2:14:32] and the wife was set free
[2:14:35] perfect type
[2:14:38] perfect type
[2:14:42] the woman
[2:14:46] and it truly is I mean this fleshly
[2:14:49] Journey that we're on you know we're I
[2:14:52] love brother brother
[2:14:53] Ernie used to say he said we're not
[2:14:54] fleshly beings Heaven having a spiritual
[2:14:56] experience he said but no he said We Are
[2:14:59] Spiritual Beings having an Earthly
[2:15:01] Earthly experience right
[2:15:03] we're literally we're literally
[2:15:05] Spiritual Beings having a a an Earthly
[2:15:08] experience down here in flesh and you
[2:15:10] know what it's not easy not at all it's
[2:15:12] it is full of Woe and it's full of
[2:15:14] Sorrows and it's full of heart
[2:15:16] heartaches and all these different
[2:15:17] things to all who are dwelling in these
[2:15:19] fleshly Dwelling Places is hard it's not
[2:15:22] exclusive to the Christians either it's
[2:15:24] hard all over the world breaks your
[2:15:26] heart when you see somebody go through
[2:15:27] some of the hardest things of life and
[2:15:29] they don't know Jesus man if only you
[2:15:32] know Jesus right
[2:15:33] I had an employer one time first survey
[2:15:36] I ever worked for and he was an
[2:15:37] alcoholic and and druggie prescription
[2:15:39] druggie
[2:15:41] genius it's just a genius absolutely
[2:15:44] Genius of a man could figure things in
[2:15:46] his mind faster than 10 times faster
[2:15:49] than I can do it on a calculator
[2:15:51] and he would he would he would sit there
[2:15:53] and he would just get so strung out and
[2:15:55] everything else and he'd cry and
[2:15:57] everything else and he's I don't know
[2:15:58] why and you know one time he actually
[2:16:00] broke down he said Dutch I don't know
[2:16:01] what's wrong I don't know how to fix it
[2:16:03] I don't know what to do and all these
[2:16:05] things and I said Anthony listen you
[2:16:07] need Jesus
[2:16:10] you need Jesus I don't know the answers
[2:16:13] to all these things but I know Jesus
[2:16:15] does and Jesus Christ can fix this
[2:16:17] situation he can break these bonds he
[2:16:19] could break these Cycles he could do all
[2:16:21] these you need Jesus
[2:16:24] and he looked at me and he said Jesus is
[2:16:26] mad at me
[2:16:28] I said no he's not Anthony no he's not
[2:16:32] he says he's not mad at me he's not mad
[2:16:34] at you he's calling for you to come back
[2:16:37] he's calling for you to come back
[2:16:39] never could get over that hump
[2:16:42] never could get over that hump
[2:16:45] I walked in and I found him dead of an
[2:16:47] overdose
[2:16:48] he took blood pressure medicine in a 24
[2:16:51] case a 24 case of these huge beard but
[2:16:55] ice or whatever it was nasty stuff
[2:16:58] drank himself to death with a blood
[2:17:00] pressure medicine stroked out right
[2:17:01] there
[2:17:04] four days later
[2:17:06] you know brother Brown talks about those
[2:17:08] ones that that die and it hurts to say
[2:17:11] this I'll just tell you that but he
[2:17:12] talks about those ones that
[2:17:14] that die but they don't have a body to
[2:17:16] go to remember
[2:17:19] you've got a word body
[2:17:22] are you are you a Christian today are
[2:17:25] you a Believer today
[2:17:27] you've got a word body
[2:17:29] if this if this Earthly Tabernacle be
[2:17:31] dissolved we have one waiting for us
[2:17:34] Eternal in the heavens right
[2:17:36] there's a sixth Dimension that is full
[2:17:38] of theophanese word bodies that are
[2:17:39] there amen and if if I was to fall over
[2:17:42] Dead with a heart attack right now and
[2:17:45] and I'd be I'd be there I'd go I know my
[2:17:48] Lord amen I trust him I believe him I
[2:17:50] have no doubt whatsoever that when I'm
[2:17:52] absent here I want to be present there
[2:17:55] I'll close my eyes here and I'll wake up
[2:17:57] over there Hallelujah right oh what a
[2:18:00] time that's going to be praise the Lord
[2:18:02] amen
[2:18:04] but he said if you don't have that if
[2:18:06] they don't have those those that
[2:18:07] theophany that word body waiting for him
[2:18:09] he said they're they're just kind of
[2:18:11] there many times not all the time but
[2:18:13] many times it's almost like limbo
[2:18:15] they're just stuck they can't go there
[2:18:17] because they don't have a body and they
[2:18:19] they're not it's not judgment yet they
[2:18:21] can't go to the Judgment so they're just
[2:18:22] kind of stuck
[2:18:24] and he said well do you think the loss
[2:18:26] would go to hell that is a hell
[2:18:29] it's a separation which is what death is
[2:18:31] death is a separation
[2:18:33] there's a natural death and it's nothing
[2:18:34] but a separation from this Earthly body
[2:18:36] that has nothing to do with who you are
[2:18:38] Christians do not die
[2:18:40] amen because they cannot be separated
[2:18:43] from Christ Jesus who loves them
[2:18:45] right
[2:18:47] but when they go you know if they were
[2:18:49] to go on beyond that that without that
[2:18:51] without that love of Christ without that
[2:18:53] Assurance without that body and they go
[2:18:54] he said they're just kind of wondering
[2:18:57] four days after my my boss my friend
[2:19:00] because we'd become close by that time
[2:19:02] four days after that
[2:19:05] my other bosses at the time his wife

[2:20:00] was so happy because she felt like she

[2:38:41] that he'll take you

[2:38:47] takes her under his
[2:38:49] wing
[2:38:51] and he's your protector
[2:38:54] his brother Dutch said he's your healer
[2:38:58] he'll never turn you away
[2:39:00] and you know what he can't be mad at you
[2:39:03] if he loved you before the foundation of
[2:39:06] the world he can't change his mind he
[2:39:09] loves you now you just might think he
[2:39:11] doesn't because he has ways that we we
[2:39:14] don't have but it all works out for the
[2:39:16] good

[2:39:55] you all for coming brother Daniel and
[2:39:57] your wife and if I miss your name I just
[2:39:59] Lord bless you
[2:40:01] um the group from Ohio and just part of
[2:40:04] a sign
[2:40:04] we appreciate them and their sacrifice
[2:40:07] for coming down and and being with us
[2:40:10] and and brother Eduardo and sister Emily
[2:40:13] she fit right in
[2:40:15] fair right in that's uh brother
[2:40:18] Christians um stepdad and and mother
[2:40:22] and we sure they they sure had fun last
[2:40:24] night
[2:40:25] so and we appreciate them show the love
[2:40:28] of God this world will never see the
[2:40:30] love of God outside of me and you never
[2:40:33] will hatred vile things go on in the
[2:40:36] world that ain't God
[2:40:39] but like brother Dutch says
[2:40:41] you sisters why would God put you on
[2:40:44] display that you don't cut your hair
[2:40:46] that you don't wear in modest clothes
[2:40:48] that people can go instead of turning
[2:40:50] looking oh my God they turn and look oh
[2:40:52] I see God right there's a big difference
[2:40:55] in saying oh my God like but oh they
[2:40:59] look just like God they Godly
[2:41:01] there was a man that left close to
[2:41:04] Gillsville that he saw June one time in
[2:41:07] Walmart and he's walking down he looks
[2:41:08] back and he says I just want to shake
[2:41:10] your hand he said he said I don't see
[2:41:13] many Godly women so see that's your
[2:41:16] that's you on display that's you showing
[2:41:18] the world that there is somebody that is
[2:41:21] Godly that God can live a life through
[2:41:24] and us being the bride you men you got
[2:41:27] to do the same thing too you want don't
[2:41:29] be cussing fussing he's right running
[2:41:31] people off the road
[2:41:34] first time
[2:41:35] getting tickets
[2:41:42] we learn a lot when you get people
[2:41:43] coming to the Valentine's banquet but
[2:41:46] listen we're all human beings but you
[2:41:48] know at least one thing different
[2:41:49] between us and Them is we've got God in
[2:41:52] our heart amen we've got our spiritual
[2:41:54] Rudder that when things go wrong and
[2:41:57] things don't go the way you think it
[2:41:58] ought to go there's a Rudder that turns
[2:42:00] you yes the storms of life may want to
[2:42:02] blow you all the way across the ocean
[2:42:04] but there's a Rudder that little bitty
[2:42:05] thing that big ship is run by one little
[2:42:08] bitty thing that'll turn and when it'll
[2:42:10] do brother John it'll put you right in
[2:42:11] the winds
[2:42:13] it'll put you right in the place you're
[2:42:15] supposed to be and we uh we're I believe
[2:42:19] we're in the place we're supposed to be
[2:42:20] I believe this is there's not I'm not
[2:42:21] searching for nothing else I'm not
[2:42:24] looking for another message I'm not
[2:42:25] looking for another prophet
[2:42:27] I'm looking for us to just finally do
[2:42:28] what the prophet said amen be what he
[2:42:32] said
[2:42:33] that's the greatest thing is just is to
[2:42:34] be what he said not to sit in church and
[2:42:37] you know be a message believer
[2:42:39] but be what he said amen how many times
[2:42:42] have I told you the greatest gift you
[2:42:43] could give your pastor we give Dad many
[2:42:45] things but I'll guarantee you he'll tell
[2:42:47] you that if you'll just live what I
[2:42:49] preach he said that's the greatest gift
[2:42:51] you've ever ever get to live what I
[2:42:54] preach because no money can buy that
[2:42:56] right there's no dollar amount that'll
[2:42:59] buy that it comes from the heart and
[2:43:01] it's totally free amen totally free
[2:43:04] just accept it you love the Lord amen
