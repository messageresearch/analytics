[26:20] let's go to revelations
[26:22] eight we've been speaking on the shout
[26:25] but today we're going to kind of
[26:26] continue with that but we're also to go
[26:28] into the voice this would be part four
[26:33] of the seventh sealed the voice I talked
[26:36] to brother Claude yesterday and we
[26:37] talked for about an hour and he's on
[26:38] he's on part 21 on the seventh seal so
[26:43] see what you got to look forward to and
[26:46] we had opened the Seventh Seal There was
[26:47] silence in heaven about the space
[26:49] of a half-an-hour let's bow our heads
[26:52] down Lee father thank you today Lord
[26:53] that we have a opportunity to stand
[26:56] before the greatest people in the face
[26:57] of this earth the bride of Jesus Christ
[27:00] and Lord that we can speak Lord and lets
[27:06] you do the speaking you do the revealing
[27:08] Lord you do you do what you're supposed
[27:11] to do you said If any man hear my voice
[27:16] then you said my sheep hear my voice and
[27:19] a stranger they will not follow so lord
[27:22] I pray that we hear the voice of you
[27:25] today that'll not be a strange voice as
[27:28] in past times we've we've heard strange
[27:32] voices of strange doctrines strange
[27:34] ideas but Lord there is one voice that
[27:36] is correct and that's your voice Lord
[27:40] you've never had to take back a word
[27:41] that you've ever said we thank you for
[27:43] that Lord we put all of our confidence
[27:45] in what you said why do we ask you to
[27:48] forgive us of our sins be with us Lord
[27:50] in the further min of this service you
[27:52] take over Father for your honor and
[27:53] glory in Jesus name Amen you be seated
[27:56] we'll read John 19 verse 30 said when
[27:58] Jesus therefore had received the vinegar
[28:00] he said it is finished and bowed his
[28:02] head and gave up the ghost eventually
[28:04] we'll get into that but as of right now
[28:06] we won't be but we're gonna read that so
[28:08] that just puts the little seed in your
[28:09] head because he said it is finished in
[28:13] other words his earthly journey was over
[28:15] with as far as being that part he was
[28:19] done it was finished but did that finish
[28:21] his work no no that just actually begun
[28:25] his work he bowed his head and gave up
[28:27] the ghost that's why we're talking about
[28:28] the seventh seal the silence in heaven
[28:30] there's nothing we can write on the
[28:31] board we make it into something later on
[28:34] or maybe I be able to write something on
[28:35] the board as God reveals it but right
[28:37] now you'll not see that board because
[28:39] there's nothing gonna be put on the
[28:40] board because there's silence in heaven
[28:42] for the space of a half an hour
[28:43] nothing's going on
[28:45] but don't tell me when Jesus said it is
[28:49] finished that that was it no he just
[28:52] continued doing his work he went on to
[28:54] the to the souls in prison he came and
[28:57] got the people paradise he went and took
[28:59] his body and got it glorified walk step
[29:02] back on
[29:02] the earth won't drop back among the
[29:04] disciples left them and told them I'll
[29:06] be right back in just a few days and
[29:08] came back on the day of Pentecost and he
[29:09] has not rested since and man he's been
[29:12] doing a job and today that's what we're
[29:14] going to talk about a little bit now the
[29:15] shout sometimes when you see a shout you
[29:20] it's when somebody shouts you turn to
[29:23] see what's going on anytime in a crowd
[29:26] somebody shouts you see what's to see
[29:28] what you look turn to see what's going
[29:30] on but now as we go into the voice I've
[29:34] said many times before you know you can
[29:36] you can be in a crowd and and they're
[29:39] all talking and all you hear is just
[29:41] this muddled muddled words but all of a
[29:45] sudden your child says mama our daddy
[29:50] right what do you do you know there's
[29:54] silence all the way around you then
[29:56] you're focused on what that child killed
[29:59] that's your child and you are connected
[30:01] to that child mmm
[30:03] so that's the same way with God when
[30:05] John turn to see the voice in
[30:08] Revelations we'll get to it he turned to
[30:10] see the voice and what did he see he saw
[30:12] seven golden candlesticks and one lock
[30:15] into the son of man standing there
[30:17] John realizing he knew that voice was
[30:19] all right so that's what our whole thing
[30:23] now is to see the shout of the voice and
[30:25] the Trump because the voice is the voice
[30:27] of the resurrection so it cannot be a
[30:29] voice just a voice it's got to be the
[30:32] voice of God amen so that's what we're
[30:35] going to get into today but let's kind
[30:36] of background a little bit the Bible
[30:38] says also in Ephesians 4:30 grieve not
[30:40] the Holy Spirit of God whereby you're
[30:42] sealed until the day of your redemption
[30:45] now remember everybody's made the
[30:48] seventh seal this and that and the other
[30:49] and all these different things
[30:51] you heard many doctrines and many things
[30:53] talked about the seventh seal but if
[30:55] brother Claude and I were talking
[30:56] yesterday
[30:57] there's your seal grieve not the Holy
[30:59] Spirit of God we are you're see where
[31:01] are you are sealed until the day of your
[31:03] redemption the seventh seal is your
[31:06] total Redemption your total Redemption
[31:09] not seven men with voice is not tenth
[31:13] vision
[31:14] not return ministry the Seventh Seal is
[31:19] your redemption so it's they've made it
[31:23] everything else I we were talking last
[31:25] night and it's true Satan Satan loves us
[31:29] to believe those different things that
[31:32] Satan's job is to get us to what get us
[31:34] offline from listening to the real voice
[31:37] of God that tells you that if this
[31:39] seventh seal book is a book of
[31:42] redemption who gets redeemed first me
[31:46] and you so it's the seventh seal is not
[31:49] this out here and and you know brother
[31:51] Brown says you know what this man do he
[31:53] looks and sees what's coming he see
[31:54] what's behind but he forgets what's
[31:56] going on right now well what's going
[31:57] right now on right now is it's the seven
[32:00] seals being open it's being open now in
[32:03] an individual form sure brother branham
[32:06] back ever how many years ago that was
[32:07] that seal open to him and he saw what he
[32:11] was but he couldn't tell all the three
[32:13] parts remember he said one part open
[32:15] yesterday one today and one was in an
[32:18] unknown language not that I know
[32:20] language is one that you and I gonna
[32:21] talk about maybe about 30 sermons from
[32:23] now hmmm
[32:25] Colet I believe that there's three parts
[32:27] to it and the unknown part that was in
[32:31] an unknown language has got to be
[32:33] revealed before the seventh seal can
[32:36] totally open all right so now let's just
[32:38] background a little bit of what we've
[32:41] been talking about looking go to number
[32:42] one but I wants to keep this in mind the
[32:46] seventh seal is not a happening that you
[32:53] can write on the board now we took the
[32:57] first seal wild horse rider and we wrote
[32:59] him across and we put white and we put a
[33:01] church and we put a church age with it
[33:03] and we put this with it and we put the
[33:05] number two and number three and number
[33:07] four number five and number six we just
[33:09] fill the board full right with symbols
[33:12] and acts and things that went on but the
[33:16] Seventh Seal you can't put anything up
[33:18] there it's disappeared but it's being
[33:23] made known
[33:25] amen and where's it disappeared out in
[33:28] you all that drawings is all disappeared
[33:32] where's it disappeared it's disappeared
[33:34] in your revelation this whole seventh
[33:37] seal is about you not about this one
[33:39] than that one and the other one and this
[33:40] is happening and this one coming back
[33:42] and this one this this and that and this
[33:44] and the other everybody's waiting on the
[33:46] third pool third polls are opening of
[33:48] the word if it's not opening to you then
[33:49] you're on the admit in the second pool
[33:50] yet okay let's just be that's what means
[33:53] brother clock were talking about last
[33:55] night everybody screaming third pool
[33:56] third pool they can't get out of the
[33:58] second pool they can't get out the first
[34:01] pool some of them that was a healing
[34:03] campaign they can't get out of that the
[34:05] third pools not the healing campaign the
[34:07] third polls the opening of this seal
[34:09] right here the opening of the word amen
[34:11] it's not carnal reform carnal reform is
[34:15] laying on of hands and all those other
[34:17] things we've been through all that
[34:19] hey ma'am I'm just telling you what
[34:21] brother Brown said so look let's get
[34:24] number one a break he breaks the seal so
[34:26] now we know one thing's for sure he's
[34:27] the only one can break the seal reveals
[34:30] gives us his inheritance to his people
[34:33] he gives the inheritance that he
[34:35] inherited now we all know that but some
[34:37] of you that our brother John and sister
[34:40] my back with us for at least for one day
[34:43] I really wish we could lock them up and
[34:45] and keep him here but sister mice she
[34:51] said something about going back home so
[34:53] Oh blame her I'm not gonna blame
[35:00] brothers you animal blame her but but we
[35:04] were on the seals when they were hit
[35:05] last time but we're on number seven now
[35:07] but this inheritance that Jesus
[35:10] inherited remember he inherited eternal
[35:13] eternal life in his body all right his
[35:17] body was not redeemed until it was
[35:21] changed okay all right and it was not
[35:24] eternal now it is eternal when he walked
[35:27] out of that tomb he inherited eternal
[35:31] life becoming kinsman redeemer why
[35:34] kinsman redeemer has to be a flesh cuz
[35:37] ah rake flesh kinfolk alright Christ
[35:42] couldn't be our kin Jesus class had to
[35:45] be our kin amen alright because remember
[35:48] Christ is the anointing in Christ could
[35:50] anoint people but when Jesus Christ came
[35:51] on earth as a human being that was our
[35:55] kinsman redeemer we could go to him and
[35:57] he could what he could take back all
[35:59] that that Satan had took away from us he
[36:02] could take that back
[36:04] being kinsmen he inherited eternal life
[36:07] and who is the seal we're going to talk
[36:10] about in just a minute
[36:11] Jesus Christ is the seventh seal we are
[36:13] we're gonna read that in just a minute
[36:14] Christ is the seventh seal alright and
[36:15] freely gives it out to who us so what
[36:19] are you and I we are recipients of
[36:21] whatever he gets that's pretty simple
[36:24] but we are recipients we just not really
[36:27] believe that yet we are recipients of
[36:30] this eternal inheritance all right he
[36:33] was the one who redeemed but instead of
[36:36] keeping himself he gives it back to what
[36:38] the people me and you that's his love
[36:42] for us all right let's go to the second
[36:44] one I'm gonna try to stay on my notes
[36:46] today number two the breach preach one
[36:50] of these seals the whole thing together
[36:52] now look the whole mystery lays in these
[36:54] seals every mystery of the Bible lays in
[36:59] these seals and the seals cannot be
[37:01] broken until that time I noticed the
[37:04] book remember sealed here's remember it
[37:06] was sealed up wrapped up but look what
[37:08] he says it's a book of redemption well
[37:13] so now look so you can't take seal 1
[37:16] through 6 and say well that was
[37:17] redemption and then the seventh seal
[37:19] something different it's a total plan of
[37:23] redemption remember 7 is completion that
[37:27] completes the whole plan of redemption
[37:29] is that number 7 we went through that
[37:33] number 7 number 7 is God's completed
[37:36] number alright so number 7 and the whole
[37:39] thing together makes the book and it's
[37:40] sealed with seven seals now remember we
[37:42] saw it where the seals are open now you
[37:44] can read what's on the pages from
[37:46] Genesis to Revelation a complete plan of
[37:48] redemption
[37:49] is revealed in these seven seals now who
[37:52] does that start with now it says a
[37:53] complete plan of redemption but you and
[37:57] I have to reveal redeemed first then the
[38:00] earth actually look hold on us 144,000
[38:04] then the earth then the foolish virgin
[38:08] white throne judgment and then full
[38:11] Redemption only happens when we walk
[38:13] into that new city
[38:14] all right that's when full redemption is
[38:16] over it's when we walk into that city
[38:19] but remember redemption is over for us
[38:22] here that's why the Bible says in
[38:24] Revelations 10 times shall be no longer
[38:27] you and I have entered it not we're not
[38:30] in a church age we're not in any age at
[38:33] all we're in the bride age just like
[38:35] everybody else just come out but I want
[38:37] you to really see something that they
[38:38] brought the club brought to my attention
[38:40] and I want to read it to you in just a
[38:42] little bit but from Genesis to
[38:44] Revelation a complete plan of redemption
[38:45] is revealed in these seven seals oh it's
[38:48] an important time now is it important to
[38:50] you is it important to you or are we
[38:55] just coming to church again that's my
[39:01] question to you is it important all
[39:03] right let's go to number three it's
[39:05] rising a son look what we've seen in
[39:09] this day the quickening power has come
[39:11] to us to open the seven seals what was
[39:14] it the intelligence of a man no the
[39:17] quickening power of God
[39:19] now remember during that whole seven or
[39:23] actually it was eight days of those
[39:25] meetings brother Branham hardly raised
[39:29] his voice there was no there was a
[39:32] prayer line on the day of the questions
[39:35] and answers and if you'll read that
[39:36] prayer line he hardly does any
[39:39] discernment
[39:40] he just says God bless you in the name
[39:42] of the Lord bless you look read your
[39:43] book read your still book in the name of
[39:46] Jesus receive your healing he just went
[39:47] in other words what am I saying
[39:49] there was no shouting no no screaming no
[39:51] no great what we would call an anointing
[39:54] but he said it was the greatest
[39:56] anointing he ever worked under and it
[39:58] was a quickening power now what are you
[39:59] and I looking for we're looking for a
[40:01] quickening power to where we do like
[40:03] the Joe is we we get up and we we gonna
[40:08] do that you'll fall asleep bro Joe's
[40:10] coming out of that building not the ace
[40:12] I told him to keep this thing on cuz we
[40:14] coming out here we gonna walk around
[40:16] we're gonna find Jesus today
[40:18] alright but look the quickening power of
[40:22] God is when God quickens the word to you
[40:24] not your neighbor not brother day on my
[40:28] brother way when God quickens the word
[40:29] to you that's why we keep asking even
[40:32] brother Dale where is your experience
[40:34] can you actually go back and find out
[40:38] where you were justified know where you
[40:40] were sanctified know where you received
[40:43] the new birth know that God has worked
[40:45] on your life for no micariff you've been
[40:48] in the mentioned 50 years of 15 minutes
[40:49] if you got the new birth you're that
[40:52] 11th hour worker that come in right now
[40:54] today and you get just as much as those
[40:57] people that I told them many times
[40:59] before
[41:00] here we are with brother down we got
[41:02] brother all the different ones just went
[41:05] on and you got brother Howard Carol and
[41:08] different ones that I mean they just
[41:09] paid the road for us us young preachers
[41:13] we should be I'm not young by no means
[41:14] but I'm a young preacher but by no means
[41:16] should we have to have all this garbage
[41:20] in front of us they went through the
[41:24] garbage they blazed the trail they've
[41:27] cut back all the unbelief where we
[41:29] should have a free Road to where we just
[41:31] take it right on to the coming of the
[41:33] Lord amen so we ought to thank God that
[41:36] that we are now at the end time when
[41:39] everything is coming apart out there but
[41:42] it's coming together in here all right
[41:45] here's the one who opened those seals he
[41:48] is those sails now look so if you open a
[41:51] seal and if you see the seals and if you
[41:53] talk about the seven seals you got to
[41:56] talk about Christ and Christ is the
[42:02] seals that was open not the Antichrist
[42:05] it exposed the Antichrist but it
[42:09] revealed Christ what is the opening of
[42:12] seals then revealing Christ number one
[42:15] number two number three number four
[42:17] five number six and number seven is
[42:20] revealing of Christ because if you
[42:23] didn't have Christ on the first seal who
[42:25] opened the first seal to the Prophet
[42:27] brother branham the seventh seal did
[42:29] Christ open that seal brother Brahm
[42:32] didn't open seal Christ opened the seals
[42:37] the whole Word of God is Christ and
[42:40] Christ is the seals that was open
[42:41] everybody alright with that say Amen so
[42:44] now let me ask you a question you say oh
[42:46] well the seals were were there tonight
[42:48] in the other let's narrow it down narrow
[42:52] it down today we're going to narrow it
[42:53] down
[42:53] what is the opening of the seals
[42:55] revealing Christ all right let's go to
[42:57] the next Scripture Colossians 1 verse 26
[43:00] we've read this a million times even the
[43:02] mystery which has been hidden from ages
[43:07] and from generations now what is
[43:08] happening Paul is standing in a position
[43:11] and he's looking back through the Old
[43:14] Testament because remember he's writing
[43:17] the New Testament hey he's not even
[43:20] gotten you know there's not even search
[43:22] agent just barely started when he wrote
[43:24] Colossians amen
[43:25] all right so what's he doing even the
[43:27] mystery which have been hid from ages
[43:29] and from generations but now it's made
[43:32] manifest to his Saints to whom god would
[43:35] make known what is the riches of the
[43:37] glory of this mystery among the gentiles
[43:41] which is christ in you the hope of glory
[43:46] whom we preach warning every man that's
[43:50] what we've been doing for 50 years since
[43:52] the prophets left and teaching every man
[43:55] and all wisdom that we may present every
[43:58] man perfect in Christ Jesus so where's
[44:06] the Seventh Seal today oh it's brother
[44:08] Branham coming back artist 10 oh it's
[44:10] this boat all right this plane all right
[44:12] we made it no I'm sorry Satan has made
[44:15] it everything but the truth the truth is
[44:18] the Seventh Seal is you if it don't open
[44:22] to you and if you don't manifest if we
[44:23] don't take a body change then this thing
[44:25] is totally wrong brother Branham wasted
[44:29] his time
[44:30] but we know he did because that was the
[44:33] voice of God speaking to me and you and
[44:35] you and I are now commissioned to carry
[44:39] this thing on amen
[44:41] the same voice though not another voice
[44:44] not another doctrine not another
[44:45] denomination there's more denominations
[44:48] in this message and they are out there
[44:49] in the world but how can there be if
[44:53] it's the voice of God just what a
[44:54] million brother clock worked on them you
[44:56] see the voice of God written on a book
[44:57] right it used to be called voice of God
[45:00] recording or I guess it is now used to
[45:02] be spoken word now it's voice of God
[45:03] really really and they tell you to stay
[45:07] home and less than the state that ain't
[45:10] divorce the guard folks you hear me that
[45:14] ain't the voice of God that's the voice
[45:16] of a man but the voice of God will tell
[45:19] you to do what that Bible says
[45:21] regardless of anything else it will tell
[45:23] you to do what the Bible says because
[45:25] Christ is the seals Christ is the word
[45:28] in Christ is for in you so how can you
[45:31] say something different in that chain of
[45:33] command you can't you can't alright
[45:41] let's go to Matthew they say this is
[45:44] revealing Christ and what was the
[45:45] mystery the mystery the mystery was
[45:48] Christ in you the hope of glory that's
[45:50] the great mystery now Jesus is telling
[45:53] them after this isn't Matthew 24 right
[45:56] it's amongst right at the end of the
[45:57] seals remember he's not speaking of the
[45:59] seventh seal but watch what he says and
[46:01] except those days be shortened there
[46:03] shall be no flesh there should no flesh
[46:05] be saved but for the elects sake those
[46:08] days shall be shortened we're fulfilling
[46:10] that Scripture that's me and you I'm
[46:15] gonna get to something in just a minute
[46:17] there's some script listen folks there's
[46:19] some scripture in this Bible that's not
[46:22] to you there's some scripture in this
[46:27] Bible is to you and everybody else there
[46:30] scripture in this Bible that's just to
[46:31] you only and nobody else we got to find
[46:34] the ones that are to us and nobody else
[46:36] all right for the Lord himself shall
[46:39] descend from heaven with a shout in the
[46:40] voice who is that - that's to you
[46:44] that's to no-one else you no one heard
[46:47] the shout no one else heard the voice
[46:50] except you're not done you say throw
[46:54] away all the other scriptures no I
[46:56] didn't say that but you got to read the
[46:58] ones this to you brother Brown said a
[47:03] present-day truth a present-day
[47:06] revelation they didn't have that
[47:09] revelation even when brother Branham was
[47:11] here of the shout in the voice in the
[47:13] Archangel really no they didn't there
[47:18] was no resurrection in brother Browns
[47:20] ministry now I'm talking bout no
[47:21] resurrection I'm talking about big
[47:22] regulation not just resurrection of the
[47:24] Dead and then there wasn't that's now
[47:29] look then if any man shall say unto you
[47:33] lo here is the seventh seal are there
[47:39] believe it not for there shall arise
[47:42] false Christ's and false prophets and
[47:45] shall show great signs and wonders I
[47:48] mean come on people that what we're
[47:50] living under great signs and wonders and
[47:53] so much that if it were possible they
[47:55] shall deceive the very elect jesus said
[48:00] behold I have told you before wherefore
[48:05] if they shall say unto you behold he is
[48:07] in the desert go not forth behold he is
[48:12] in the secret chambers believe it not
[48:16] for as the Lightning cometh out of the
[48:18] east and shines even to the west so
[48:20] shall also the coming of the Son of man
[48:23] be how are you gonna know where Christ
[48:26] is if he's in you you know where he is
[48:33] if he's in you you don't have to if
[48:36] someone comes you said well you need to
[48:38] go so-and-so Church they got this
[48:39] doctrine that you need to believe well
[48:41] you know what if you got the Holy Ghost
[48:42] inside of you it'll say know some new
[48:47] doctrine come up and if it's not true
[48:48] what's that Holy Ghost supposed to do it
[48:50] protects the word but it protects you
[48:53] because you're part of the word
[48:55] and then that's what we have to do we
[48:57] have to look for the protection of the
[48:58] words but look nobody you know when that
[49:00] light is where you know you say well it
[49:02] comes from over here it came from over
[49:03] here that same wave you know we're a
[49:05] mystery
[49:06] we are the hidden mystery from the
[49:09] beginning of time is that there's a
[49:13] bride standing on this earth with all
[49:14] this junk going on all these things
[49:16] going on in politics and going on in
[49:18] religion and going on even in this
[49:19] message amen that you and I can
[49:24] understand it and not be rattled not be
[49:28] fearful not be wandering back and forth
[49:31] that's what they did in the wilderness
[49:32] they wandered over here they wandered
[49:34] over there amen that's what you and I
[49:36] are doing we're not wandering in the
[49:37] wilderness we're wondering whether it's
[49:40] so-and-so is right or whether this one's
[49:42] writing hurt some things brother Claude
[49:45] told me that his brother told him though
[49:46] if anybody wants to know it and private
[49:48] I'll not say it out loud but my heaven I
[49:50] can't believe messy people or preaching
[49:51] what they're preaching I just cannot
[49:53] believe it well yeah I guess - because
[49:56] roll that back down for there shall
[49:59] arise false Christ's and false prophets
[50:03] and shall grow show great signs and
[50:06] wonders and so much that if it were
[50:10] possible they shall deceive the very
[50:12] elect
[50:14] now Jesus is talking that's red letters
[50:18] babe that's talking to me and you hey
[50:20] man that's red letter I didn't put that
[50:23] red letter there that's in the Bible in
[50:24] red letter that's Jesus talking
[50:29] everybody got it up maybe I understand
[50:35] but if Christ in you he can't be if it's
[50:38] the real if it's Christ it can't be
[50:39] false can't be false all right but there
[50:44] shall arise false Christ's and show
[50:46] great signs and wonders and so much that
[50:50] if are possible they shall deceive very
[50:52] late
[50:53] all right let's look at number four now
[50:58] what is the Seventh Seal here we go to
[50:59] what we were we were going back to what
[51:01] the seal is we must remember that the
[51:03] seventh seal is the end of time of all
[51:06] things that's right the things written
[51:08] in this
[51:09] have a sealed book sealed up of the
[51:10] white plan of redemption I want that to
[51:13] go over and over in your head if anybody
[51:15] says the Seventh Seal is this or that or
[51:16] the other say does it do does it is it
[51:21] my Redemption is it has something to do
[51:23] with my Redemption I'll listen to you
[51:24] buddy if they don't have anything to do
[51:26] with my Redemption if it's got where it
[51:28] makes this brother this and this brother
[51:29] that and this brother that I don't want
[51:31] it I want to know about to plan a
[51:34] Redemption for me
[51:35] amen and you should say the same thing
[51:38] about you so if somebody comes to you
[51:40] with a false doctrine it doesn't have to
[51:42] do with the plan of redemption get away
[51:44] from it I mean really come on there's no
[51:47] redemption and let's be honest there's
[51:50] no redemption in an airplane or killing
[51:52] a black bear you don't understand what I
[51:54] mean that we need to focus on what God's
[51:56] told telling me and you and man what God
[51:59] is telling us that's the plan of
[52:02] redemption the seals of the plan of
[52:03] redemption this Bible has the plan of
[52:06] redemption in it but now look it every
[52:08] bit ends it is the end now look remember
[52:11] that word end that word in is not like
[52:14] me and you think we said well I'm my
[52:18] life has ended no that's not what that
[52:22] end is because look it said it's the end
[52:25] of the struggling world now is the end
[52:27] of the world no because when we take a
[52:31] body change and we leave here the
[52:32] world's gonna continue to go on actually
[52:36] in the millennium it's gonna go on
[52:37] another thousand years then when we get
[52:40] to the white cone judgment we got a new
[52:43] heaven and a new earth the earth is
[52:45] eternal so it's not gonna pass away so
[52:47] it's not the end it's the end of the
[52:49] what just like I was trying to explain
[52:51] the other day with with with hope back
[52:53] there she didn't die she just became a
[52:55] mama well that ended her life of being
[52:59] without a child right so we got to do
[53:02] the same thing when you became a
[53:03] Christian it ended your life of being a
[53:06] sinner amen
[53:08] so that's the end that we're looking for
[53:09] we're looking for the end of our
[53:11] redemption which is the full possession
[53:14] of our body change that is what we're
[53:18] looking for
[53:21] and you know what let me add one in here
[53:24] it's the end of death death has been
[53:28] destroyed even Paul tells us death
[53:30] where's your strain it's been great for
[53:32] you victory it's the end of the
[53:34] struggling world it's the end of the
[53:35] struggling nature it's the end of
[53:37] everything and there's the end of the
[53:39] trumpet's because you know what the end
[53:41] of the trumpets is when God goes to the
[53:42] Jews and the seven trumpets open under
[53:45] the sixth seal and what happens Christ
[53:49] comes and takes 144,000 and takes them
[53:52] in a rapture amen
[53:54] so that's the end of the 144,000 but
[53:57] remember that's just their beginning
[53:59] I've been 244,000 eternal ones alright
[54:03] it's the end of everything so remember
[54:06] let's not look and say well brother
[54:07] Brown the seven seals just that's the
[54:09] end you know there's a wall right there
[54:12] at the end no no when it when God brings
[54:14] something to an end it's just the
[54:15] beginning of something else cuz remember
[54:16] it's eternal it's just a circle find
[54:20] find the end of the circle you can't
[54:22] find it but there is a phase you go
[54:25] through because there's an end of this
[54:27] and end of that and the end of this and
[54:29] the end of that listen there should be
[54:31] in the end of you and I struggling
[54:34] struggling with our salvation
[54:37] that's what brother Dale's trying to
[54:39] teach us right now is the end of our
[54:42] struggling of our salvation then God can
[54:46] take us on up the Statue of a perfect
[54:48] man then God can speak to us more and
[54:51] more but if you sit there worrying every
[54:53] day I gotta do something about it he's
[54:57] laid to plan out I mean you couldn't do
[54:58] no more than write it on that wall Ron
[55:06] did you put that there
[55:08] hey yeah hey I got where's the stick at
[55:16] it's the end of the trumpets that's the
[55:19] end of the symbol it's the end of the
[55:21] vials it's the end of the earth now see
[55:23] it's the end of the earth but it's not
[55:25] the end of the earth like we think it's
[55:26] the end of the earth and then so let's
[55:28] don't look at that word in like abrupt
[55:30] stop it's my brother now said that
[55:34] even brother mode I think was teaching
[55:36] her brother Dale was teaching the end of
[55:37] one step it's the beginning of another
[55:42] you in this step now what is that step
[55:45] that step if this step is built on top
[55:48] of that bottom step so this ends this
[55:51] step and begins this one but when you
[55:53] get on this step it ends this one and
[55:55] begins this one alright so that's the
[55:58] way God is because God never how can an
[56:00] eternal God bring something to an abrupt
[56:02] end AJ and when they sin God it just
[56:05] keeps going and going and going
[56:07] alright now that will be an end of
[56:09] sinners there'll be an end of a sinful
[56:11] world what see that's not part of God
[56:13] anything it's not part of God we'll have
[56:16] it in but Christ can't have it in that's
[56:20] wife is inside of you you can't have an
[56:21] end and then it's the even the end of
[56:24] time time runs out but now look time
[56:28] runs out for me and you but not for the
[56:31] Jews so they've got 1260 days they've
[56:35] got to be brought to salvation then in
[56:39] the Millennium you've got 1,000 years of
[56:42] daylight dark daylight dark you see what
[56:45] I'm saying but we are not we are eternal
[56:48] creatures right now we just got to get
[56:50] this thing to catch up with what's
[56:51] inside and when we do that then time
[56:54] will run out for us that's the Seventh
[56:57] Seal when the Seventh Seal produces
[56:59] itself it's Christ back on earth in
[57:01] human flesh
[57:02] all those times where we were preaching
[57:04] on the I am and all these different
[57:06] things where you can say I and my father
[57:08] are one I came from God I go back to God
[57:11] that's what that said one said it was it
[57:14] was telling you that that's what we're
[57:15] coming to we're coming to a realization
[57:17] that that's who we are but you hear me
[57:22] it's not an event do you know what the
[57:24] Seventh Seal is y'all wind up we don't
[57:28] do it now but y'all line up and if you
[57:30] want to see the Seventh Seal I'll put
[57:31] the chart back right here but
[57:33] everybody's born again come stand in
[57:35] front of it that's the Seventh Seal is
[57:39] your life standing there what's your
[57:41] life in Christ is because it's Christ in
[57:42] you the hope of glory right so you're
[57:45] bringing Christ revealed but
[57:47] remember it's a secret to everybody else
[57:50] try to explain your crazy life to
[57:53] somebody else how many times have you
[57:58] tried to explain your heart to somebody
[58:00] else what the Lord's done for me and
[58:02] they go yeah right sure right well
[58:06] that's a mystery but until but now what
[58:08] if you can get Christ in them then they
[58:11] got a story then thank God they say oh
[58:14] yeah I believe that well let me tell you
[58:16] about my experience it just keeps going
[58:18] on and on amen so it's the end
[58:20] everything runs out in this time the end
[58:22] of the end of this seventh seal all
[58:26] rights go to number five I'm sorry let's
[58:31] read that notice this the end of the
[58:32] church age it's the end of the seven
[58:35] seals because remember what is the seven
[58:39] cells Redemption when you come to a body
[58:42] change your redemption is over now not
[58:44] the world and not the 144,000 but yours
[58:47] that's what I'm telling you you need to
[58:49] find the scripture that pertains just to
[58:51] you because you're reading revelation is
[58:58] not about two witnesses that's not to
[59:00] you we can glory that they are a product
[59:04] of when we leave but that's not to you
[59:07] that 1260 days I'll promise you you
[59:11] don't want to be here during that time
[59:12] so that's not to you set that aside
[59:15] that's not to you Lord we glory that
[59:17] there's going to be 1260 days sermon to
[59:20] the Jews but you're getting yours now if
[59:22] you miss it now you're not going to get
[59:25] it over there because that part of the
[59:26] scripture is not to you you got to find
[59:29] the scripture that is to you
[59:32] alright number five and in Sabino Canyon
[59:36] says this is the third pole now he's on
[59:41] the Seventh Seal he's talking about the
[59:43] Seventh Seal this is the third pole then
[59:45] there's three great things that goes
[59:47] with it
[59:48] one unfolded today that's what he was
[59:50] preaching on or yesterday the other one
[59:52] unfolded today and there's one that I
[59:53] cannot interpret because it's in an
[59:56] unknown language but I was standing
[59:58] right there look
[59:59] and this is the third poll coming up now
[1:00:02] what is the third poll the opening of
[1:00:04] the word it's the catching of the big
[1:00:07] trout go back to the vision it's the
[1:00:12] catching of the big trout remember the
[1:00:15] bait on the hook was the healing
[1:00:17] campaign but it wasn't the hook that
[1:00:20] caught the bait doesn't catch the fish
[1:00:22] it attracts it to the hook that you hide
[1:00:27] that hidden mystery you hide in flesh
[1:00:35] that's what catches the trout
[1:00:37] it's the hook that catches the trout not
[1:00:40] the bait now the bait attracts it you've
[1:00:41] got to have bait to get to it but we've
[1:00:45] had many times bait stolen brother Danny
[1:00:48] did we catch any fish from Matt no but
[1:00:53] when we hid the but when we hid the hook
[1:00:56] when we hid the hook and made the fish
[1:00:58] take it and eat it and it caught that
[1:01:01] rainbow trout all right
[1:01:03] so now he was standing a look this is
[1:01:07] the third pole coming up the Holy Spirit
[1:01:08] of God oh my that's the reason all
[1:01:09] heaven was silent just shows it's from
[1:01:14] God now we're gonna get to that just a
[1:01:15] second about the shout in the voice it's
[1:01:18] from God for it fits exactly in the
[1:01:21] promises of God form from from the end
[1:01:25] of the message and notice notice now for
[1:01:28] the end of time message you and I are
[1:01:31] under the end of time message and man
[1:01:34] this is the only message you're going to
[1:01:37] get this is that after all he's revealed
[1:01:44] all the six seals but don't say nothing
[1:01:47] about the seventh remember there's no
[1:01:49] symbol and the end time seal when it
[1:01:53] starts will be absolutely a total secret
[1:01:57] according to the Bible now it'll be a
[1:02:00] total secret but remember we go back to
[1:02:02] the mystery if they're revealing if
[1:02:04] revealing Christ is the seventh seal and
[1:02:06] Christ in you as the sea is the mystery
[1:02:09] that where's the mystery lay it lay
[1:02:11] you please realize that and I'll promise
[1:02:17] you it'll take care of all this
[1:02:18] confusion of all these other things that
[1:02:21] needs to happen that we think needs to
[1:02:22] happen yeah I'm only concerned with
[1:02:28] what's happening to me and you I'm not
[1:02:32] concerned with all this other stuff I'm
[1:02:33] concerned with what's happening inside
[1:02:34] of you and inside of me because let me
[1:02:38] read your scripture this real plain and
[1:02:40] simple have you read this before yeah we
[1:02:43] just read it a couple of Sundays ago
[1:02:44] with my Sunday but look let me go back
[1:02:49] to that quote just a minute ago rent the
[1:02:51] end time seal when it starts will be
[1:02:53] absolutely a total secret so it's not
[1:02:55] for everybody
[1:02:58] it's not for it's not for all the bride
[1:03:04] it's only for the body change the group
[1:03:07] that's gonna take a body change those
[1:03:09] that have went on and passed on and
[1:03:11] they're enter in the grave and no
[1:03:12] they're not in the grave forget that
[1:03:13] Lord stop it they're not the graves
[1:03:15] they're sitting over there waiting on us
[1:03:16] in the sixth dimension waiting on us to
[1:03:18] get off and on and then so they're
[1:03:21] waiting on us what they've come to their
[1:03:23] part they've come to their perfection
[1:03:24] amen but somebody's got to come to the
[1:03:27] perfection here and draw them out of the
[1:03:29] grave it'll be a third Pole I'll promise
[1:03:32] you that it'll be a pull cuz it's gonna
[1:03:33] pull them right out of that grave amen
[1:03:36] so this message look this message around
[1:03:39] the world is a total secret tried it and
[1:03:43] really go take this message to the White
[1:03:46] House go take this message to your
[1:03:50] neighborhood Church it's a mystery they
[1:03:55] don't believe it so why are you sitting
[1:03:58] here so why are you sitting here oh you
[1:04:04] believe it right it's just as plain as
[1:04:06] day to us you know why it's plain cuz
[1:04:09] what's this for this we say unto you by
[1:04:13] the word of the Lord that we take your
[1:04:18] Bible in circle that word we because
[1:04:21] that's talking about no one but you
[1:04:25] that's not even talking about Paul now
[1:04:30] we Paul became of a we which are alive
[1:04:41] and remain unto the coming of the Lord
[1:04:46] now what coming of the Lord is that see
[1:04:48] the denomination is gonna read this and
[1:04:50] they're gonna say oh that's got to
[1:04:52] happen you know when we see Christ
[1:04:54] coming from spread the eastern skies and
[1:04:56] he's gonna come walking down you know
[1:04:59] and and he's gonna come and get us left
[1:05:04] behind go watch that movie now the whole
[1:05:11] world thinks it's a great movie and it's
[1:05:12] right in line with their denomination
[1:05:14] lined is why it's wrong you miss the
[1:05:18] ripe tree you're not gonna get a second
[1:05:19] shot they get a second shot cuz it's
[1:05:23] that Left Behind thing now if you left
[1:05:26] behind you gonna be left behind alright
[1:05:29] my brother Dale said the other day is
[1:05:31] weaken a lot of people in plead
[1:05:33] ignorance you can't plead ignorance in
[1:05:35] this church you've been told all the
[1:05:38] mysteries that's what me and Klaus been
[1:05:39] talking about you've been told all the
[1:05:41] mysteries you've been given to full
[1:05:44] seven-course meal now what do you
[1:05:50] believe it or not that's your business
[1:05:51] but you've been given you can't plead
[1:05:54] ignorance you can't plead you can't sit
[1:05:56] there and look off on the wall somewhere
[1:05:57] and say I didn't hear that no you heard
[1:05:59] it if your a lot if you're not asleep
[1:06:01] you heard it boy you better woke up
[1:06:10] that's coming after you I just didn't
[1:06:14] want you to fall out in the floor or was
[1:06:20] that that we which are alive and remain
[1:06:22] we which are alive and remain until the
[1:06:26] coming of Lord shall not prevent them
[1:06:27] which are asleep for the Lord Himself
[1:06:30] that's a personal pronoun the Lord
[1:06:33] himself shall descend from heaven - who
[1:06:36] - you
[1:06:38] to the Wii to the Wii with a what a
[1:06:45] shout with the voice of the Archangel
[1:06:48] and with the Trump of God and the dead
[1:06:50] in Christ shall rise first that's why I
[1:06:53] said brother John I'm not looking for a
[1:06:55] rapture
[1:06:56] I forgot that rapture just in the event
[1:07:03] that's coming right there's got to be a
[1:07:08] resurrection first there's got to be a
[1:07:11] body change second then there's a
[1:07:13] rapture and the rapture happens only
[1:07:16] because the first to happen first so you
[1:07:19] can preach I'll see you in the rapture
[1:07:21] and all these other things that's okay
[1:07:22] that's alright you say that don't do
[1:07:24] wait with a song some people get so
[1:07:28] dogmatic about other things I'm not
[1:07:31] saying that I'm just telling you though
[1:07:32] why focus on a rapture Satan would love
[1:07:37] for you to focus on the rapture that
[1:07:39] Left Behind thing but I want to focus on
[1:07:44] what the dead in Christ shall rise first
[1:07:48] then circle that word again we which are
[1:07:55] alive and remain shall be caught up
[1:07:58] together there's the rapture the
[1:08:00] remember the word rapture is not even in
[1:08:01] the Bible and then but now the
[1:08:03] resurrection sure is and the body change
[1:08:06] sir is to wit the redemption of the body
[1:08:09] right Romans 8 I want to read that to
[1:08:11] that brother sometime I fell back to
[1:08:13] Romans 8 said to wit the redemption of
[1:08:15] the body don't tell me there's not
[1:08:17] enough redemption for the body it's in
[1:08:18] the Bible they will eat you are alive
[1:08:21] endure then we which are alive and
[1:08:23] remain shall be caught up together we
[1:08:27] shall be caught up with them in the
[1:08:31] clouds to meet the Lord in the air so
[1:08:33] shall we ever be with law remember we
[1:08:34] meet him there so brother Brad was going
[1:08:36] to tell us in his descending he does
[1:08:38] these three things now remember we were
[1:08:40] talking about this couple of Sundays ago
[1:08:42] it's not that God is up there descending
[1:08:47] down so that we can see him the Lord
[1:08:50] himself shall do
[1:08:52] sin now remember he descended on the day
[1:08:57] of Pentecost went in 120 people and he
[1:09:01] didn't leave he's still here
[1:09:03] but he's descending in the word that we
[1:09:06] hear he's descending how can you do I
[1:09:09] looked up the definition of descent that
[1:09:12] means to go from a higher form to a
[1:09:13] lower form well what's he doing he's
[1:09:15] descending from a form we can't
[1:09:17] understand to a form we can't understand
[1:09:21] now what's the form that you and I can
[1:09:23] understand
[1:09:26] thank you sister
[1:09:28] Christ in you I can understand when I
[1:09:32] see lie brother Dell said this morning
[1:09:33] you're Christian because you act like
[1:09:35] Christ so what do you see you see Christ
[1:09:37] do you see the person no you see Christ
[1:09:40] that's the mystery then we which are
[1:09:43] alive and remain shall be caught up
[1:09:44] together with them in the clouds to meet
[1:09:46] the Lord in the air so shall we ever be
[1:09:47] with the Lord wherefore comfort one
[1:09:49] another with these words and that's what
[1:09:52] we do every Sunday and every Wednesday
[1:09:53] and every time we want to we match play
[1:09:56] but that scripture look is specific to
[1:09:59] me and you that's not to the first
[1:10:01] church age that's not to the second
[1:10:04] church age
[1:10:04] that's not to the third church age of
[1:10:06] the fourth of the fifth of the six and
[1:10:08] not even really to the seventh search
[1:10:09] age that's to you and me because you and
[1:10:13] I are the only one that's going to hear
[1:10:14] the shout we're the only one that's
[1:10:17] going to have the voice of the
[1:10:18] resurrection and we're the only one
[1:10:20] brother Brown said the Trump always
[1:10:22] gathers two people together he said to
[1:10:24] us that's for the marriage supper okay
[1:10:27] so that takes us right to the marriage
[1:10:29] supper of the lamb we've already went
[1:10:30] through a resurrection of body change
[1:10:33] and being caught up right there then
[1:10:35] Williams reliable remain shall be caught
[1:10:36] up together with them in the clouds to
[1:10:38] meet the Lord and there let's go the
[1:10:40] rapture message number six now I want
[1:10:43] you to notice a great thing taking place
[1:10:45] here don't miss this see notice the word
[1:10:47] says here in 2nd Thessalonians that
[1:10:49] there's three things notice in it
[1:10:51] strange there was three things in the
[1:10:52] opening of the seventh seal now there's
[1:10:54] three things in the descending of God
[1:10:55] there was three things in the sixth seal
[1:10:57] the open all right so three is what
[1:10:59] perfection notice from the 13th to the
[1:11:02] 16th birth there is three things that
[1:11:05] has to happen
[1:11:05] for the Lord himself appears now
[1:11:08] remember he will never appear in a body
[1:11:10] form on the earth until the Millennium
[1:11:13] right so who's he going to appear in yo
[1:11:21] sorry
[1:11:22] okay I can keep you awake screaming at
[1:11:27] you you and brother Larry brother
[1:11:28] Larry's got his earphones in I mean as
[1:11:30] the earplugs in so it just muffles it
[1:11:33] doesn't take the sound away just muffles
[1:11:35] the sound right that's right and that's
[1:11:38] all right with me that's okay ain't got
[1:11:39] a problem with that at least he stays
[1:11:42] awake but quickly now we can cluck so we
[1:11:47] can close same we're here notice a shout
[1:11:48] of voice of trumpet let's read now for
[1:11:51] Lord Himself sick things first shall
[1:11:52] descend from heaven with a shout with
[1:11:53] the voice of the Archangel Trump of God
[1:11:55] three things happen a voice a shout a
[1:11:57] voice a trumpet has to happen before
[1:12:00] Jesus appears remember he does not
[1:12:02] appear in body form her brother branham
[1:12:04] said that he would become so visible
[1:12:06] among us that he would change us and
[1:12:08] we're going to rapture right I'll bring
[1:12:10] that quote next Sunday Jesus does all
[1:12:12] three of them when he's descending now
[1:12:14] where's he descending from not from
[1:12:16] heaven even Moses told the people a long
[1:12:19] time ago he said he's not in heaven
[1:12:21] he's Navi even in my mouth the word of
[1:12:26] faith you preach you got to bring this
[1:12:30] thing personal I'm telling you folks and
[1:12:34] I'm just gonna be really honest with you
[1:12:35] what club says I'll be really honest
[1:12:37] with you that means I'm not gonna like
[1:12:38] it
[1:12:39] we have come to this far in this message
[1:12:42] and we've got so many Catholic ideas
[1:12:46] till it's horrible brother Dale pray for
[1:12:50] my kids brother Dale save my kids
[1:12:53] brother Dale take care of all my
[1:12:55] problems I think you need to do the own
[1:12:59] prayer because he didn't descend now
[1:13:01] sure now look he's got to descend in the
[1:13:06] ministry first because we're first
[1:13:08] particulars of the but you you part of
[1:13:10] that brother branham does a bride have a
[1:13:14] ministry yes and it's going on right now
[1:13:18] a man three things a shout voice of
[1:13:23] trumpet now Jesus does all of them when
[1:13:25] he's descending a shout what is the
[1:13:28] shout all right brother branham he's
[1:13:30] gonna take this big dance a shout now
[1:13:32] what is it it's the message he narrows
[1:13:36] it down it's the message going forth
[1:13:39] first the Living bread of life bringing
[1:13:41] forth who the bride who are you thank
[1:13:47] you three things happen a voice a shout
[1:13:50] has to happen before Jesus appears he
[1:13:52] does all these strings as descending
[1:13:53] alright let's go to the next quote
[1:13:54] number seven rapture message the first
[1:13:56] thing comes when he starts descending
[1:13:58] from heaven now remember what is heaven
[1:14:02] heaven is the word - where's he
[1:14:09] descended from he's descending from the
[1:14:11] word he's always been in the word he's
[1:14:13] just stepping forth - Shh hey shout got
[1:14:23] your attention
[1:14:25] but what happened look you were you were
[1:14:27] going through life and then all of a
[1:14:29] sudden that was a shout now I didn't get
[1:14:38] well yeah I got shouted up by my mama
[1:14:39] but most of you did - most of you did -
[1:14:46] okey-dokey then
[1:14:47] so anyway but we didn't hear a physical
[1:14:51] shot what you hear you heard a message
[1:14:53] you heard something you'd never heard
[1:14:55] before you had heard something that that
[1:14:57] that tweets your attention than you went
[1:15:01] where'd that come from
[1:15:02] I thought how was the Christian I
[1:15:05] thought I already had it you just didn't
[1:15:09] know right yeah but that shot wasn't a
[1:15:12] physical hey but it was so profound
[1:15:16] though that it turns you like brother
[1:15:18] Dale said you were going in this
[1:15:19] direction and that thinks that shout
[1:15:22] coming you turn and you didn't go what
[1:15:27] no you do that well somebody men on it
[1:15:29] but you didn't do that you didn't go you
[1:15:31] start going back with no you turn and
[1:15:33] start headed toward that shout you
[1:15:36] headed toward that message the first
[1:15:39] thing is a shout so it's got to be the
[1:15:41] message to get the people together
[1:15:43] that's why you gathered here today you
[1:15:45] didn't gather here because it was lula
[1:15:46] georgia or because brother Dale is the
[1:15:48] preacher you gathered here because you
[1:15:51] knew the message was going to come forth
[1:15:53] from somebody and that you were going to
[1:15:55] share the message with somebody right
[1:15:57] here in this sanctuary all right so a
[1:16:00] message to get the people together a
[1:16:02] message come forth first what lamp
[1:16:06] trimming time now what is that that was
[1:16:12] the part of the message that brought you
[1:16:14] to the lamp trimming time you know what
[1:16:15] you still even though you might have
[1:16:17] been a Christian in a denominational
[1:16:19] Church which you could I'm not arguing
[1:16:21] with you but you still when you came to
[1:16:24] the message you still had to what there
[1:16:27] was one thing you quit trimming it was
[1:16:32] one thing you quit driven that was your
[1:16:35] hair sisters a man though you might have
[1:16:38] been walking in this direction and
[1:16:39] everything is no game but something
[1:16:42] turns you and said hey it's wrong to do
[1:16:45] that
[1:16:46] rise and trim your lamps what watch was
[1:16:49] it the seventh watch not the sixth the
[1:16:54] seventh behold what behold a shout
[1:16:58] behold the bridegroom cometh now
[1:17:03] remember the Bible says the voice of the
[1:17:05] bride and the voice of the bridegroom
[1:17:06] will not be heard in her anymore talking
[1:17:10] about the denominational world in the
[1:17:13] old mother horn that will read that next
[1:17:15] Sunday says rise and trim your lamps
[1:17:18] what in this seventh watch which is who
[1:17:20] you and I and they did some of them
[1:17:24] found they didn't have any oil in their
[1:17:26] lamp
[1:17:27] that's the foolish virgin that's the
[1:17:30] people that have struggled through all
[1:17:31] these years and not have been talked
[1:17:32] correct how to get the new birth because
[1:17:37] remember foolish virgins don't have the
[1:17:39] new birth so somewhere alone
[1:17:40] and they were justified and sanctified
[1:17:42] and nobody could take him on to the
[1:17:44] baptism of the holy ghost in their soul
[1:17:46] it could have been an anointing thank
[1:17:53] god brother branham taught us about it
[1:17:56] only one but it's lamp trimming time all
[1:18:01] right let's go to the next one what does
[1:18:03] the shout mean the shout means an order
[1:18:06] a command specifically a stimulating cry
[1:18:13] huh either that by which animals are
[1:18:17] roused and urged on by man as horses by
[1:18:20] charioteers hounds by hunters are that
[1:18:23] by which they signal is given to men a
[1:18:28] signal was given to us by a prophet and
[1:18:33] said here is God exactly you want to I
[1:18:38] was just gonna say Frieda said come out
[1:18:41] of her my people that's exactly what it
[1:18:42] was that was the shout the shout was

[1:18:47] as red as a dress is that you but she
[1:18:50] but yeah she but you said you didn't

[1:18:56] thank God for these people that if these
[1:18:58] brothers and sisters that we walked with
[1:19:00] when we were a little kids and now
[1:19:01] they're all made a circle around and and
[1:19:05] and come back in there in our age and
[1:19:12] and being good solid Christians you know

[1:19:25] just a picture on the wall you know what
[1:19:26] I mean about brother branham's just a
[1:19:27] picture on the wall but now it's not
[1:19:29] it's become something in our heart it's
[1:19:30] become a life it's become something
[1:19:32] God's give us and thank God God give us
[1:19:35] time thank God he didn't cut this thing
[1:19:39] off in 1965 how many of you in 1965 were

[1:19:51] see what I mean rest of us is what
[1:19:54] dead we were dead dead in trespasses and
[1:19:59] sins then the denomination we were dead
[1:20:01] somewhere but see God's give us time
[1:20:04] right the gods give us time to bring
[1:20:07] this thing together but now look he's
[1:20:11] long-suffering but remember there's a
[1:20:13] time that he's going to bring an end to
[1:20:15] this thing so you and I are gonna have
[1:20:18] to get off and on and start doing we

[1:20:52] somebody coming well you know the one
[1:20:53] that was a shout to get everybody's
[1:20:55] attention to get the attention of the
[1:20:56] people well that's what brother Branham
[1:20:58] came to this earth to do was to get us
[1:21:01] not to get our attention on him but to
[1:21:05] get our attention on Christ and what
[1:21:08] Christ is doing for you and me amen now
[1:21:13] look let's see number eight
[1:21:15] mmm-hmm the rapture message now first
[1:21:17] thing is the sounding first thing is the
[1:21:19] trumpet and he gets a little confused
[1:21:21] here let's go back a shout the voice of
[1:21:23] trumpet shout is a messenger getting the
[1:21:26] people ready now who's the people me and
[1:21:31] you remember this shout voice in
[1:21:33] Archangel it's not going to happen but
[1:21:35] the one group of people the second is a
[1:21:42] voice of the resurrection the same voice
[1:21:46] now look not a different voice the same
[1:21:50] voice that ain't allowed voice in Saint
[1:21:52] John 11 38 to 44 that called Lazarus
[1:21:55] from the grave remember brother Branham
[1:21:57] I'll bring it to you next Sunday brother
[1:21:59] Branham said if Jesus would have said
[1:22:02] everyone come forth they would have come
[1:22:04] out of the grave
[1:22:05] he said he said Lazarus to bring one man
[1:22:09] out
[1:22:09] but I'll promise you that won't happen
[1:22:11] anymore
[1:22:12] this voice of the resurrection is for
[1:22:15] those dead saints that are in the other
[1:22:17] dimension that's going to come into this
[1:22:19] dimension because look it says getting
[1:22:21] the bride together and then the
[1:22:25] resurrection of the Dead to be caught up
[1:22:28] with it now watch the three things take
[1:22:30] place the next what was a trumpet voice
[1:22:32] shouting trumpet now the third thing is
[1:22:34] the trumpet we'll cover that later on
[1:22:36] which always at the Feast of Trumpets is
[1:22:38] calling the people to the feast and
[1:22:40] that'll be the bride supper the lamb
[1:22:43] supper with the bride in the sky see
[1:22:45] because when we start getting the Feast
[1:22:48] of Trumpets which brings everybody
[1:22:49] together for a feast
[1:22:51] the Jews down here in this on this earth
[1:22:54] is getting their trumpets the seven
[1:22:57] trumpets they're getting because the
[1:23:00] seven trumpets are not to us but the
[1:23:01] feasts of the Trump is is to us it's a
[1:23:04] gathering come together right the first
[1:23:08] thing comes forth is his message calling
[1:23:10] the bride together the next thing is a
[1:23:13] resurrection of the sleeping bride so
[1:23:15] what's the next thing we're looking for
[1:23:17] so you don't look at me cross-eyed when
[1:23:20] I say I'm not looking for a rapture but
[1:23:21] he's not either he's preaching the
[1:23:23] rapture message but he tells us look the
[1:23:27] first is the message calling the bride
[1:23:29] together the next thing is the
[1:23:31] resurrection of the sleeping bride now
[1:23:34] who brought Lazarus from the grave Jesus
[1:23:38] Christ God in human flesh brought
[1:23:42] Lazarus out of the grave the Son of Man
[1:23:45] brought Lazarus out of the grave what
[1:23:50] ministry are you and I under right now
[1:23:53] the Ministry of the son of man Christ
[1:23:56] back again not in one flesh william
[1:24:00] branham but in all the flesh of the
[1:24:02] bride of Jesus Christ amen
[1:24:05] there's a seventh seal but see nobody
[1:24:08] wants to talk about it because what's
[1:24:11] this great thing going on Wow do you
[1:24:14] think you got something yeah yeah I do
[1:24:16] I've got what everything he told me I
[1:24:17] guys
[1:24:18] amen romans 8 says where errors and
[1:24:23] joint-heirs with Christ believe it the
[1:24:28] next thing is resurrection of the
[1:24:29] sleeping Brides the ones died back in
[1:24:31] the other ages they're caught together
[1:24:32] and the trumpet the feast in the heavens
[1:24:34] in the sky while that's the thing that
[1:24:36] take place friends so what are we
[1:24:37] looking for the message to call us
[1:24:39] together has this message already called
[1:24:41] us together yes calling us now together
[1:24:45] now the problem is like me and brother
[1:24:48] Clark we're talking about how can you
[1:24:50] call the bride together under all these
[1:24:52] different doctrines that's not the voice
[1:24:57] of God but there if somebody is going to
[1:25:00] have to come together under the voice of
[1:25:04] God not the voice of so-and-so or
[1:25:07] brother so-and-so or sister so and so or
[1:25:09] this so-and-so or that so and so God's
[1:25:13] not that confused this message is not
[1:25:16] that confused
[1:25:19] Amen it is not but what's this let's
[1:25:27] read them now the first thing comes
[1:25:29] forth ain't go back then the next thing
[1:25:31] is resurrection of the sleeping bride
[1:25:34] yeah once died bucking the other agents
[1:25:36] they're called together and the trumpet
[1:25:37] the feast in Heaven's in the sky well
[1:25:39] that's the thing it takes place we're
[1:25:40] right there ready now the only thing the
[1:25:47] church coming out has got to lay before
[1:25:50] the Esso in to Robin that's been our
[1:25:54] fifty year journey or sixty year journey
[1:25:57] almost since the prophets died
[1:25:59] it's what lay before the Esso end we've
[1:26:03] made it lay before somebody else but we
[1:26:06] got to lay before the Esso end to what
[1:26:08] to ripen alright let's go the next quote
[1:26:13] now watch this right here
[1:26:15] godless evil age that's a good message
[1:26:17] for y'all to read if you got time you
[1:26:20] listen only to one voice my sheep know
[1:26:28] my voice
[1:26:31] and a stranger they'll not up what is
[1:26:36] his voice any man's voice is his word so
[1:26:43] what is the voice
[1:26:44] it's his word and this is it the Bible
[1:26:51] not one word to be added to it are taken
[1:26:55] from it just stay right with that voice
[1:26:58] a stranger they won't follow a
[1:27:01] denomination might I add a little bit to
[1:27:03] that a false doctrine listen how can the
[1:27:08] Holy Ghost send you to a false doctrine
[1:27:11] you can't have a pure lead you to impure
[1:27:15] now you can have an impure doctrine and
[1:27:18] lead you to pure but you can't have a
[1:27:20] pure you can have the Holy Ghost and it
[1:27:22] leads you to evolved doctrine now listen
[1:27:25] folks you say well what about Luther
[1:27:26] Wesley God winked at there ignatow there
[1:27:29] was God had not descended to them in
[1:27:33] that form that he's descended into us
[1:27:36] now if you got that he descended to
[1:27:39] Luther and the just shall live by faith
[1:27:41] Luther was over here drinking a beer and
[1:27:43] smoking a pipe in a pub he was a German
[1:27:46] but that was his message God winked at
[1:27:50] the ignorance of that man being a
[1:27:51] Trinitarian and baptizing the name of
[1:27:53] Father Son Holy Ghost but you come
[1:27:55] through the next one got a little bit
[1:27:57] better than you come through the
[1:27:58] Pentecostals to come with the gifts and
[1:27:59] all that then you come into the oneness
[1:28:01] then you come into the baptism name Lord
[1:28:03] Jesus Christ then you got the message
[1:28:05] they tied up all those loose ends and
[1:28:08] brought us what see look brother branham
[1:28:12] had to God through William Branham had
[1:28:14] to bring all the loose ends together and
[1:28:16] then bring his message that's our
[1:28:18] problem we major on the minor the minor
[1:28:23] was two loose ends kinda the minor was
[1:28:26] the healing campaign the minor was all
[1:28:28] that the major is what we're bringing
[1:28:33] now the major is the opening of those
[1:28:37] seven seals to change our body without
[1:28:40] it there was no one else
[1:28:42] no other messenger except Jesus Christ
[1:28:45] himself that's why the son of man
[1:28:47] ministry has to be here as pure as it
[1:28:49] was on the face of the earth in AD 30 to
[1:28:54] change our body called this the only
[1:28:56] thing he's changed is you know what
[1:28:58] changed his body the word you know
[1:29:01] what's gonna change your body the word
[1:29:03] not something happening not something my
[1:29:05] print on this board up here gonna be
[1:29:07] something for you you listen to only one
[1:29:11] voice what does that mean let's go let's
[1:29:14] see now what we got we went from shout
[1:29:15] to voice let's see what voice is right
[1:29:18] here real quick voice is a sound or B
[1:29:22] noised abroad and noise a sound a tone
[1:29:25] of inanimate things as musical
[1:29:28] instruments but watch this right here a
[1:29:30] voice in other words the sound of
[1:29:33] uttered words there's the voice the
[1:29:41] sound of uttered words not false listen
[1:29:47] we now live under the voice of God not a
[1:29:54] voice the voice the voice of God is to
[1:29:58] get our bodies ready for a change and
[1:30:01] it's right there in the scripture is not
[1:30:04] a new Bible that had to be written we
[1:30:06] just got to take the prophets message
[1:30:07] and lay it right in that Bible and I'll
[1:30:10] guarantee it'll fit you just got to
[1:30:12] believe listen to this watch this you
[1:30:14] don't know why Thunder is next quote
[1:30:22] somebody live voices and voices the
[1:30:25] voices what's this all right here was
[1:30:28] voices oh how we need in Lulla Georgia
[1:30:32] thousands of lived voices the thunder of
[1:30:37] God thundering out in sweetness and
[1:30:40] holiness purity undefiled lives walking
[1:30:44] around in the earth today without a
[1:30:46] blemish brother Branham who are you
[1:30:48] talking about he's how much you
[1:30:51] yes sir real Christians that's thunder
[1:30:56] against the enemy the devil don't count
[1:30:59] how loud you can holler the devil don't
[1:31:03] care how much you can jump or how much
[1:31:05] can you do this or shout but what hurts
[1:31:09] the devil is to see that sanctified holy
[1:31:12] life
[1:31:13] consecrated to God say anything to him
[1:31:16] call him anything just as sweet as it
[1:31:18] can be and move right on oh my that
[1:31:20] throws him away that's the thunder that
[1:31:23] shakes the devil thousands of lived
[1:31:28] voices this message is absolutely no
[1:31:32] good without you and me it's got to be
[1:31:38] someone speak it and someone receive it
[1:31:41] and becoming and God never speaks a
[1:31:45] voice without somebody to respond to he
[1:31:49] does not cast his pearls before swine's
[1:31:52] he does not what he does not have a word
[1:31:56] return void you and I can set up here
[1:31:59] and we can talk and just stuff about you
[1:32:01] know work and all this stuff that's just
[1:32:03] junk but when God speaks to us there's
[1:32:08] got to be a speech and a reception amen
[1:32:13] so that's what you and I are we are now
[1:32:16] thousands of live voices the thunder of
[1:32:19] God thundering out in sweetness and
[1:32:21] holiness purity undefiled bodies walk
[1:32:24] around earth today without a blemish
[1:32:27] that's 1961 before the seals open see
[1:32:33] that that's the thunder that shakes the
[1:32:36] devil number 11 we got two more living
[1:32:39] and twila thing and God has promised to
[1:32:42] meet the need of the hour
[1:32:45] all right he always does that and we
[1:32:49] need the voice of God today to meet the
[1:32:53] need of the hour to meet the time we're
[1:32:55] living in remember what I said about
[1:32:56] scriptures there's certain scriptures
[1:32:59] that means exactly you you personally
[1:33:02] God wrote that scripture knowing you
[1:33:04] would read it and be part of it right
[1:33:05] here well that ought to shake you that
[1:33:08] ought to shake you spoon
[1:33:09] right out of the bowl Aaron and after he
[1:33:18] has promised that we can rest assured
[1:33:20] that he will keep his promise that's the
[1:33:22] confidence that the believer has in his
[1:33:24] maker that he promised to meet the need
[1:33:26] and today one reason that the church is
[1:33:29] in the condition that it's in is because
[1:33:31] there is so many voices so many other
[1:33:36] voices to attract the church from the
[1:33:40] voice of God till it's very doubtful
[1:33:44] that many would hear the voice of God
[1:33:47] though it spoke right in their myths
[1:33:52] well let's don't let that happen to us
[1:33:55] let's don't let that happen to us they
[1:33:58] perhaps wouldn't even understand it
[1:34:00] because it would be foreign to them they
[1:34:04] have got themselves so much centered on
[1:34:06] the voices of the day let's don't be
[1:34:10] that way and if we notice in our
[1:34:13] scripture reading that the voice of God
[1:34:15] was foreign to them you know you see
[1:34:17] many times in the Bible you saw Paul got
[1:34:19] knocked down by light and God spoke to
[1:34:21] him but all they heard around him was
[1:34:22] noise when Jesus went remember when God
[1:34:25] thundered down to Jesus and remember
[1:34:27] even when brother Branham was standing
[1:34:29] there in the in the canyon on that rock
[1:34:32] and the in the whirlwind came down now
[1:34:37] buddy
[1:34:37] them guys got under under cars and got
[1:34:41] hid behind rocks and hid everywhere and
[1:34:43] here's brother I'm standing right in the
[1:34:45] middle of it he didn't have one scratch
[1:34:47] on him but you know what happened they
[1:34:50] didn't hear all they saw was rocks and
[1:34:53] noise member brother Brown said that was
[1:34:56] the angel telling me that judgment would
[1:34:58] strike the west coast see there was a
[1:35:01] voice in that like like in job there was
[1:35:04] a voice out of that whirlwind all that
[1:35:06] stuff now remember you take eli jie
[1:35:09] elijah he heard the thunder he saw the
[1:35:11] lightning he saw all these different
[1:35:13] things but did he move no he only moved
[1:35:16] when that still small voice of god said
[1:35:20] go out to the end of the cave I got
[1:35:22] something I want to take
[1:35:23] you remembered Elijah was so lousy Wow
[1:35:26] jiwoo I'm the only one left in Israel
[1:35:29] they ain't nobody serving you God but me
[1:35:32] God said come on out here
[1:35:34] stand right here at the end of the cave
[1:35:36] he said there 7000 that I've got hid
[1:35:40] away that believed the same message you
[1:35:43] do brother Brown said they believed the
[1:35:44] same message you do so quit that lousy
[1:35:46] while you of stuff but it's foreign to
[1:35:49] people for the voice of God was foreign
[1:35:52] to them let's don't let the voice of God
[1:35:53] be foreign to us and it's become that
[1:35:56] way again today that the voice of God
[1:35:59] there's so many other voices and then if
[1:36:03] God promised he would give us that and
[1:36:06] if other voices are contrary to the
[1:36:09] voice of God then it must be the voice
[1:36:12] of our enemy to confuse us and that's
[1:36:15] our problem that we would not understand
[1:36:18] the voice of God when it spoke well
[1:36:22] that's a wonderful powerful quote right
[1:36:23] now that is a powerful quote alright
[1:36:28] let's go to the net number 12 uniting
[1:36:30] time and son what do you say in Malachi
[1:36:33] 4 would restore restore back the
[1:36:34] original Pentecostal faith back to the
[1:36:36] people with the same Pentecostal message
[1:36:38] saying Pentecostal sign same Pentecostal
[1:36:41] evidence the same God the same power
[1:36:42] same teaching everything exactly with
[1:36:44] the vindication of the same pillow fire
[1:36:46] struck Paul down the road now look he's
[1:36:48] showing all these vindications hmm all
[1:36:51] these external things but now remember
[1:36:56] that uniting is a secret your marriage
[1:37:03] to Christ is a secret what we see the
[1:37:07] nations uniting we see the world uniting
[1:37:11] we see the churches uniting we see the
[1:37:14] bride uniting what uniting with the word
[1:37:17] why the word is God and as the word as
[1:37:20] the bridegroom being the word and the
[1:37:24] bride being to hear remember there's got
[1:37:25] to be the receptor they come together in
[1:37:28] a union they unite like a wedding see
[1:37:30] they're getting ready for a wedding and
[1:37:32] they become one the word becomes you
[1:37:37] now it he didn't say part of it the word
[1:37:42] becomes you and you become the word
[1:37:46] Jesus said that that day you know what
[1:37:49] all the father is I am and I'll I am you
[1:37:54] are and all you are I am and that day
[1:38:01] you'll know that I am the father father
[1:38:04] in me I and you and you and me see at
[1:38:06] that day what day so there's you another
[1:38:10] scripture that you can say that one for
[1:38:11] this one to that one for the other
[1:38:12] that's for us today we find out the
[1:38:16] great hidden mysteries of God being
[1:38:17] revealed oh how I like that so the word
[1:38:22] is the voice of the day and where is
[1:38:25] that word is in the bride right now
[1:38:28] watch let's go to the next one we read
[1:38:30] this and lesson under this read this and
[1:38:31] then we'll finish the rising of the Sun
[1:38:33] I like this sir I love this message now
[1:38:35] notice this quickening power Zoe
[1:38:38] bringing the word the mind that was in
[1:38:41] Christ wasn't you then I'm trying to
[1:38:45] show you that you when you raved when
[1:38:49] God raised Jesus from the dead he raised
[1:38:52] up you also when we gonna start
[1:38:54] believing the Prophet he raised up you
[1:38:58] also and also quickened to life with him
[1:39:02] you are now quickened to life although
[1:39:05] then you were but an attribute in his
[1:39:07] thought what when God came out of the
[1:39:09] grave when Jesus Christ came out of the
[1:39:11] grave you were an attribute you wasn't a
[1:39:12] person you were an attribute in that man
[1:39:14] although then you were but an attribute
[1:39:16] in this thoughts but God had saw all in
[1:39:19] him at the end seventh seal at the end
[1:39:28] when God looked upon the body the spirit
[1:39:31] left him in the garden again cemani had
[1:39:32] to die a man remember friends he didn't
[1:39:35] have to do that that was God God
[1:39:37] anointed that flesh which was human
[1:39:38] flesh man if he had had went up there as
[1:39:41] God he'd have never died that kind of
[1:39:42] death we know the spirit left him so he
[1:39:44] could die okay can't kill God but he
[1:39:46] didn't have to do it but remember he
[1:39:48] went there with you
[1:39:51] him see God had never separated the
[1:39:55] bride from the groom yet so when God
[1:39:58] looked down upon the body of Christ he
[1:40:01] saw both male and female back to the
[1:40:03] same thing in the beginning with Adam
[1:40:08] when he looked at at him he saw both
[1:40:10] male and female it was all redeemed in
[1:40:15] that one buddy see they are one same
[1:40:20] same word the same word spoke of the
[1:40:23] groom speak of the bride so you read
[1:40:29] these great things that happen to our
[1:40:31] Lord Jesus and remember that your
[1:40:34] prophet said that whatever speaks of him
[1:40:36] speaks of you that's why you and I can
[1:40:38] do it we can be the I am cuz he told us
[1:40:42] we could be we can be the one that came
[1:40:45] from God the one who went back to God we
[1:40:48] can be there because he told us that's
[1:40:49] what we are
[1:40:50] she is him what we gonna believe that
[1:40:54] when we see that happening we'll take a
[1:40:57] body change let's stand our feet
[1:40:59] musicians come
[1:41:07] at same boys they brought Lazarus from
[1:41:11] the grave if that's what he spoke of him
[1:41:16] he's hey he's the bridegroom amen
[1:41:19] he's the bridegroom and we're the bride
[1:41:22] we were in him when he said Lazarus come
[1:41:28] forth when he told Martha or Mary
[1:41:32] whichever one he said I am the
[1:41:33] resurrection and the life you and I were
[1:41:37] in him and represented in him at that
[1:41:41] time when did we go and start believing

[1:53:04] song wrote this song with so much

[1:53:13] with the soul that didn't change him at
[1:53:14] all he didn't go crazy he didn't quit

[1:53:18] mean to him no he just kept living this
[1:53:20] life wrote that beautiful song and kept
[1:53:22] right on going and went on and remarried
[1:53:25] again had more family you know what he
[1:53:27] just kept going on because it was well
[1:53:29] with his soul now I'm sure he fought
[1:53:32] that a lot in his human spirit but now
[1:53:37] that anchor of the soul is what kept him
