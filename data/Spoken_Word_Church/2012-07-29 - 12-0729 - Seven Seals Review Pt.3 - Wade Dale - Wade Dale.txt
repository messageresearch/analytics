leave the store open board comes in or anybody com in that it's not coming in it's not Wednesday can't get can't walk W okay all right on his KN KNE that's right he had knee had his knee something like scop it so it wasn't a replacement but whatever they scop it all right Revelations chapter 6 and for you that are here that are going to take the Ramy course uh we're going to be giving the kits out today I know we're packed but I'd like for you to have your kit they're back there so we'll get it after or between services so then I'll make the announcement this afternoon but we're going to have a baptism this afternoon so we're going to have to rush out of here and uh go down to the baptism so okay I think to do it oh fantastic great great so they're coming this morning or yeah they're okay they would just go upstairs okay but yeah all right Revelations chapter 6 now last Sunday we kind went back through one back through two and up to three and never really got to four and we're talking on the Seven Seals uh the first four seals we stayed on oh man it was how many 20s something Sundays so we may do 20 something Sundays on 5 six and 7even but we'll see but let's just get a u basis of what 1 2 3 and 4 is and this is very important and I don't want to be I don't want to be discouraging but if 1 2 3 and four has not been revealed to you 5 six and S is going to do you no good mhm okay the first four is your Redemption the Redemption of you having the new birth because that new birth is what's going to take you in the Rapture if you don't have the revelation of 5 6 and 7 then you're still going to be I mean there's people let me put it this way there's going to be millions of people that are bride that never understand the seal Millions but there not prere reccord that that you understand the seals to be born again now the Born Again experience is the life of Jesus Christ Paul said the life I now live I live by the seal no he didn't say that he said I live by the faith of the Son of God right Jesus Christ accept him as your savior going through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost getting that unclean Spirit out keeping the guy out putting the holy guy in and and then that gives you rapturing Faith now that doesn't say body change Faith but there is a group in there that's going to have a body change Faith but rapturing Faith uh lies in the tapes and the books brother Brown said well there's only going to be a small group that's going to that's going to literally stand here without death the rest are going to have to die and go by the grave but they still have Rapture and Faith cuz what's going to bring them up Rapture and faith faith their faith Romans 8 the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead if that be in you it'll Quicken your mortal body what whether you're alive or whether you're dead in the grave he going to Quicken that mortal body one way or the other by his spirit that dwelleth in you all right dwelleth means an ongoing not just an anointing but an ongoing process all right so the revelation of the seals was was to help us understand the Redemption of the body um because in the for seal the Rapture takes place TimeWise TimeWise does everybody understand that TimeWise the Rapture takes place on the four Cale but you got to have five six and seven you got to have 56 and 7 somebody does has got to have the revelation of 56 and 7 to make this happen cuz there got to be somebody standing at a body change somebody's got to stand and say Dead come out of the ground all right so that's the that's the group of people I want to be in but it's like brother dick said uh Paul was prophesying they without us cannot be made perfect well when Paul died he became part of the they right Paul said they without us who the Old Testament but then when Paul died we stand in the in time and say they Paul irenius Martin Columba William brandom cannot be made perfect without us somebody speaking the word all right so but so the first four four seals the first four seals shows rapturing Faith cuz you got justification sanctification baptism of Holy Ghost and I put rapturing Faith are brother Brown said the word because four de Messengers remember the Palmer worm Locust caterpillar and whatever the other one is four four eat it down Four's got to bring it back all right four is not a bad number if it's in restoration um or is an Earthly number which we got to have Earthly Redemption we got Earthly restoration all right so justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost that's your walk with God and then seal number four wraps up 5 six and 7even somebody's got to have a revelation of of of seal 5 6 and 7 to bring it back to this rapturing faith in Seal number four but in TimeWise seal number four is when the Rapture takes place because what is five five is the Dead Jews under the altar saying how long to avenge our blood that happens after we're gone right six seal happens when after we're gone two prophets go to Israel and open the six seal and then Jesus Christ coming to us and coming to Israel is the seventh seal which is Jesus Christ revealed in flesh for us to take a Rapture and revealed in flesh for the Jews to take a Rapture because in Ezekiel it says where did get those SCS they reveal Jesus Christ so much to the Jews not a literal man but a spiritual man though into prophets revealed Jesus so much just like we and brown did with us and what we're trying to do with each other is to show Jesus Christ in us right till they're going to say where'd you get those scars in other words where where and why were you crucified and he'll tell them where you missed it back there and why cuz yall said let his blood be on us and our children going back to Daniel 70 weeks to make an end of sin a Reconciliation of iniquity uh bringing Everlasting righteousness anointing most I mean U seal up div vision and prophecy anoint the most holy that's restoring Israel back in the natural that'll happen after we're gone that'll happen in that last week that's left over after the Rapture all right so at all times together and that's why brother R said Daniel 7 weeks is important I want yall to be praying we've got two months dad and I are going to be the featured speaker at the next Minister meeting and it's going to be on Daniel 70 weeks so just keep us in your prayer and that we'll say the right thing and that people will understand because same way with the seals the seals were in the Bible in the 1500s but there was nobody could break that seal right like we were talking you know preaching last Sunday about Revelations 5 see there's a lot of sayings a lot of loose ends a lot of things tied up but when that father brought that cloth out there and said hey my wife my daughter was a virgin and here's the proof that's exactly what he was doing with the Bible hey you're virgin here's the proof amen the blood of Jesus Christ has made us free from everything Body Spirit and soul but it's got to be open and revealed right can't be just shut up hid in the closet somewhere right can't be shut up here in the closet it's got to be open so you can see it right right it does you no good if I see it right but through the through the um through the gospel through preachers teachers evangelist pastors is where you get your Perfection we all do because faith comes by hearing not preaching so it does come by hearing and hearing the word of God but to have this rapturing faith we got to understand that what brother Brandon brought to us was rapturing Faith No no ever else had this Faith nobody was required to have this faith that lamb had seven horns and seven eyes he didn't have six and A2 horns and six and a half eyes he had seven horns and seven eyes which is seven complete Church Ages was able then to take the book like we were saying last Sunday I hope you caught that the book is worthy that's right the book's worthy or or Christ would he just he just he didn't lose it but remember God took it back because Adam couldn't produce it it made Adam not worthy the book didn't become unworthy Adam become unworthy so that made you and I unworthy so we're down here unworthy that's why John was saying hey I've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I got this right here he had rapturing Faith M he'll come up with it he'll come up with that Rapture in faith right so he had Rapture and faith for his time all right for his time he had Rapture in faith he's not going to call for the Rapture cuz he's dead the ones that are dead can't call for a Rapture it's got to be live people all right so he had rapturing faith for his time but he was looking at the no man is worthy neither under the Earth above the Earth or in the earth no man was worthy to take that book no man so so there was a still there was a space a Gap a Chasm a breach mhm then when the lamb came up and grabbed the book John knew then that now somebody that was worthy could take a hold of the ones that were worthy and we could bring them together so it was God and human flesh bringing the U bringing the seal that's why brother R to say here stands a lamb with a book in his hand he wasn't Jesus Christ but he was the nearest thing to it preaching to us right he wasn't God he wasn't Jesus Christ but he was the closest thing to it because he was not physically standing in the Gap like Dad he was talking about that's Jesus Christ but what was he doing he was saying you're worthy right who's worthy to open the book and loose the seal well it was the lamb that was one that was worthy but you know what if that lamb resides in you makes you worthy that's right so that's where we're going to get rapture in faith when we start realizing like brother for preached Wednesday night that was really good to bring that on Wednesday coming in from what from what Dad and I had had ministered on Sunday is bringing that there's there there no condemnation ifes said who can condemn me a sin why can't we but you better not be with sin that's true or you can be condemned that's right so let's let's don't get so high and walk so high and mighty let God do it for us that's right if God will do it for you it's like the Bible says you walk in and sit on the back row God will put you on the front row if God put you on the front row man don't have nothing to do with it that's right but if you go up there and sit on the front row mhm and you think you're something then and God's going to put you on the back that's what the Bible says so you're going to be put on the back row if you go up remember brother Rand that preacher he said if that preacher would have went up like he came down he would have came down like he went up cuz what he went up there with a big head and exalted itself and he couldn't get his thoughts together nothing nothing went right and he came down dejected remember brother said if he went up dejected and had the right attitude went up dejected God would have anointed him he to come down with power of not him but of God all right so that's what we're looking at in the seal we're not trying to find a powerful person the powerful person is already there the Lamb's always been there he's just being made known now that we are worthy that he did you know covers in his blood no part missed same thing with with rapturing faith rapturing faith lies in the books and Tes so seal number four let's read that here and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth Beast say come and see and I looked and behold a Pale Horse and his name that set on him was death and Hell Followed With Him and power was given here we go with a given power now unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with a sword and with hunger and with death and with the Beast of the Earth all right now you see now let's go through in the fourth seal we see it's a Pale Horse Now what is pale if you mix black red and white and mix it up in a in a dish or in a bowl you're going to get the most pale gray try it sometimes it's just an awful color but that's what brother Brown said it was all three of these horses wrapped up into one same way with the force seal in the spiritual sense is justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost if you have that if you have that that's what wraps you up in the word it's not pale but it's spiritual it's all these three wrapped up together if you have these three then you will have the word there's no way to get around it if you have the Holy Ghost it'll compare with the word you might understand every every sentence or word or whatever true but you just keep holding it there long enough God will make it known he'll reveal it to you all right but you got to have these first That's the basis of all things then you have then the word of God comes to the spirit felli which is the ones that have the Holy Ghost which is what all three of these brother R said these three complete the birth one 2 three that completes the birth then you start your walk and this is your walking God but look at you and I we're compared now with the eagle which is the last of the combat Beast no more combat Beast after that why we don't need any more combat Beast we already got all four of them there is no more there's only four four life Messengers for death Messengers eat it down which is what these right here these horses still ride today white red black and pale they still ride they're still here there's still demon powers there's still things that make us do wrong there's still things that make us uh think wrong and and because we're in this world right but then we have the line ox man and Eagle see in the in this age they only had just enough light to get them through the age they sacrificed their s they weren't bold sure they were bold in the sense that they stood up for God but this was the pure word going forth well the pure word went in the ground right here in the fourth Church age cuz I'm reading some more history on the Roman Catholic church and and man you'd be surprised at what some of those popes did during this fourth age about you know 11 uh probably right at 1,000 ad to about 1500 ad they ruled the world I mean they just ruled the world there nobody stood against them except a little group of people all right but when you come out of that age you see a man named Martin Luther he come out of the very thing that was killing the people he come out of the Catholic church but he didn't get all the Catholic church out of him he still had father son Holy Ghost baptism you see why as you progress it gets more and more into the Perfection they couldn't be made perfect here they're made perfect by the word for their hour amen they're sealed in for the word of their hour all right but they were not and they're the ones that were in that book that was worthy but it had to be a man reach and get that book all right had to be somebody with flesh so somebody's got to be alive right right cuz once that book's finished redemption's over there's no more getting saved all right you'll be given eternal life like I was preaching last Sunday about works the Bible says you'll be judged by your works if you're not born again cuz if you're born again you're covered by the blood and you're judged by his works and if he's righteous and perfect and clean and holy then you're righteous and perfect and clean and holy but if you're out from under that blood guess what works dos and don'ts right and there's going to be a group that will be put in by dos and don'ts there'll be people giving eternal life brother R I read you the quote Millions more then what will be struggling to receive it are going to be the ones that are going to be given eternal life for their standing the gospel and that's every age not just our age but it's in every age but you had the man age fifth and sixth age which is Lutheran Wesley pron presses and all look at look at what look at what's happened Even in our age in just 100 years say 112 years from 1900 to 2012 look what we've went from right hardly no electricity no telephone to now we've got Self Service anywhere in the world we instant messaging instant turn that thing on instantly around the world if we're hooked up to a cable that we can get news we got news around the world all right so that's what we've come in just 100 years well we come out of the man age into the eagle age and it's like man has just took the lid off everything and they're just shooting forward I mean they're just the advancement of man but we know that's the advancement of man but why but why is the advancement of man going so far cu the advancement of God went first they had an eagle Prophet which come in the end time to break that seal open so that we can SAR up in the skies man was afraid to go up that High um I'd be scared to grab a hold of an eagle's foot and take off but if I become the eagle that's right say if I just grabbed a hold of the Eagle's foot and said hey I'm an eagle I'm an eagle and he takes off about 20,000 ft up no but when you become the eagle 20,000 ft don't mean that or 2,000 ft don't mean anything right so that's what we got to do as far as and I hate to say the word develop but it's what we develop into you it's like a child right they got everything they need they just got to develop develop into it that's right all right same way with mercy and and Harmony over there got everything they need to be mother grandma and life goes on all that care eristics in those children but they got to what develop to that to where they can understand what's going on that's why the laws protect children from 16 or 17 years down cuz they've not developed yet all right but you see now girls 12 and 13 years old developing a lot more than when even when we were growing up but you see Satan has went right along with God he's not just you say well that eagle anointing puts us way up here well guess what guess who's following us the devil's falling right behind that's right if he's left if he's if he has left you alone I need to talk to you that's right I mean if you're up here getting good Revelation and Satan's nowhere around I I need to stop talk to you because maybe I got a problem but no no he's right up there almost with us right so don't ever think you've left him down here you've not left him anywhere that's right he right there that's right all right cuz see he'll quote you the word but this is what he doesn't have this is my key today he does not have Rapture in faith cuz if he did he'd be your brother he'd be born again and you could you could identify with him and be his brother but he does not have Rapture in faith he does not understand the Revelation behind the word of God he understands the word of God the Bible says he believes in one God and trembles all right but he gets on this Pale Horse which is all these powers mixed together and he heads up in a beast power at the end time which is going to come out of the Roman Catholic church but see we're not going to see that man of sin sitting in the temple if you see him you already missed the Rapture so don't worry about say we're going to who's is the pope or is it Obama or is it this one don't worry about that if you see him physically you're you've already missed the Rapture so so forget about that all right you worry about the man s sitting in the temple of God right here showing himself to be as God so that's where you got to watch cuz you know what brother Brown said the two spirits will be so close it'll almost deceive the very elect if it were possible that's what I mean don't think boy we're at this Eagle Ag and we're going to fly out of here we are going to fly out of here but the devil's going to be right on our heels doing this y so this thing right here is going to be sticky the prophet said until the day we're changed so don't think you've ever got this this thing conquered because you know what you won't but God will tell you when this thing's conquered he'll have to cuz he'll have to come and reveal himself that hey this is my flesh Flesh of My Flesh and bone of my bone see we quote these things but we're heading toward them right all right if you're heading toward them that's fine but you got to remember like brother Dale said those who prophesy must die so if we prophesy that there's a coming of people that's going to get a body chain then we're all going to die but when you say the one is going to happen to then you've made that prophecy come you've took the breach and brought the breach together right cuz that's what happened in Revelations 5 when when lamb took the book he didn't walk off somewhere else no he just became the one on the throne it was just like a pull that pulled him right up there and set him right down on the throne which was then the son of man ruling and reigning in me and you cuz it's got to be a son of man can't be the Son of God Son of God's been all down through here they've had rapturing faith for all these Church Church ages millions of people but they've never had the son of man Revelation where it and that was God in human flesh not a lesser person not a lesser person same person of God in another form well what are we we're either the same God in another form or the Antichrist in another another form but you see what we're heading toward we're heading we we're putting these together and in this last age like I said it had to be seven horns seven eyes so those seven horns was all that Lamb's characteristic so it had to be all seven Church ages all four beasts all four of these riters in a spiritual form so that we can get the Revelation all right all wrapped up into me and you we need this bonus of the line cuz they had the truth of of M of U one God and water baptism and what happened in the in the garden it was lost here coming back here a little bit but it had to be restored here the two book end first few ages to the last age so all this you're going to have to push here push it here push it here and it all comes into that fourth age I mean fourth seal which was the Rapture so any question we got about 5 minutes any questions kind of kind of confusing a little bit but just remember this is the Holy Ghost for all ages the first four seal cuz they're not going to get the change Faith they all have rapturing faith all right everybody understand they have rapturing faith for their time they'll come up with their group the last to be first so brother brand will come up first with his Church age then Wesley will come up with his then Luther will come up with his and then Columba and then then um Paul Martin irenius and Paul will be the last one up but they're all going to come up by rapturing faith that they had see to make a long story short they had all this in the Holy G that was in them that came to them even in the oxas all this brother R said whatever you need for your journey when you get the Holy Ghost that's what you get right well their Journey was through everybody that got the Holy Ghost the prophet said went through justification baptism the Holy Ghost but they didn't know to name that only in the eagle age were we able and even in this four seal they were able his name that set on him was death now he was death from the first from right here he was death right remember Untold billions he killed with his Doctrine right here so he was was already in here death and hell was already started right here because those that turned God down died spiritually went to hell spiritually and they're going to come up and be have to give an account and go right back to hell okay everybody understand that but only in this age and I look and behold a Pale Horse and his name his name that set on him was death and Hell Followed with him so all this was already in these people they just couldn't see but just a part of them part of the of a spot for their age Martin Luther just youall live by faith but when Martin Luther which type justification but he had to go through a form of sanctification to get to the Holy Ghost because brother R said everybody goes through justification San you might go through it in 15 minutes or 15 years doesn't matter Luther had to come the same way Wesley but they couldn't name it see they couldn't name it because the name had not been the name had died here see they could see even Paul said Grievious wolf John was the only one that said Antichrist because he's the one that went to Revelations and saw the Antichrist knew the name of it wrote it down and come back and said the Antichrist is working already in the group of people but Paul said Grievous wolves what is Grievous wolves the same people that's in this end time persecuting the bride Same Spirit but we know it is the Antichrist or the Beast system or the false system because there wasn't a Roman there was Roman government here but there wasn't a Roman religion there was no Roman Catholic church till about the third age second and third age somewhere in there it started in um Nan Council 325 ad is when they started putting everything together all right Constantine came up and he took Rome power of physical Rome and took spiritual power and put them together so they started worshiping all these different gods and took the name of the Lord Jesus Christ out and put Father Son and Holy Ghost well that held all the way through to right in here then the name became restored just like this right here it was always called Death it was always called hell Antichrist Beast falsy same person it's a devil we just see that he started as a deed a Doctrine a say a a saying a deed a Doctrine but he comes right on over here and right here he's going to be absolutely put in the power that he wants to be put in right right which is the false system or you can say Roman Catholic church but you don't have to say Roman Catholic Church cuz it's all denominations now cuz they had daughters in with that Harlot the daughters was the same as the Harlot all right so there's the first four seals U next Sunday we'll start on the uh on the fifth seal so read the fifth seal all right let's go Lord bless you
