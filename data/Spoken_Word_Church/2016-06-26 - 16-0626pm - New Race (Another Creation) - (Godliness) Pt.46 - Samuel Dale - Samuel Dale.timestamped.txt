[17:07] Peter verse
[17:09] one Simon Peter servant and Apostle of
[17:12] Jesus Christ to them that have obtained
[17:14] like Precious Faith with us through the
[17:16] righteousness of God and our Savior
[17:18] Jesus Christ Grace and peace be
[17:20] multiplied unto you through the
[17:22] knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord
[17:25] according as his divine power hath given
[17:27] unto us all things that pertain unto
[17:30] life and godliness through the knowledge
[17:33] of him that hath called us to glory and
[17:35] virtue we by given unto us exceeding
[17:38] great and precious promises that by
[17:41] these as a prophet would say these
[17:43] promises you might be partakers of the
[17:45] divine nature having escaped the
[17:48] corruption that is in the world through
[17:50] lust and beside this giv all diligence
[17:52] add to your faith virtue and virtue
[17:54] knowledge and to knowledge Temperance
[17:57] and to Temperance patience and the
[17:59] patience godliness and the godliness
[18:02] brotherly kindness and the brotherly
[18:04] kindness charity for if these things be
[18:06] in you and abound they make you that you
[18:09] shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful
[18:12] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[18:14] Christ you may be seated the Lord at his
[18:17] Blessing to the reading of the
[18:21] word
[18:24] now we're coming up through and getting
[18:26] on into deeper depths and higher points
[18:30] of understanding so I pray that you will
[18:33] just you know go along with us and just
[18:36] stay in those places and come to where
[18:39] that we're talking about the word and
[18:42] knowing that in this
[18:45] hour it's required for
[18:49] somebody you know I believe somebody is
[18:51] going to be changed don't you all right
[18:54] that's a requirement it's it's spoke of
[18:57] in the word and all and it's there and
[18:59] it'll be changed in a moment twinkle of
[19:01] an eye now that way then the biggest
[19:05] portion is not going to be that but
[19:08] they're going to die and go by the grave
[19:10] so that's that's fine too no problem
[19:12] because uh as sister Ceta used to say
[19:15] she said if I die before you do I'll
[19:17] just beat you up so that's a pretty good
[19:20] point you just get up before you do you
[19:22] know because that's the way it is the
[19:23] dead in Christ shall rise for then we
[19:26] shall be changed all right but that's
[19:29] that's just the day and the hour that
[19:31] we're living and I believe
[19:34] now that this is the end of all things
[19:39] of time we never have been date Setters
[19:42] or no points but we've always been to
[19:44] the point of of looking and talking with
[19:46] a sister last night about it I'm not
[19:48] looking as I said this morning about the
[19:50] governments the times you know what all
[19:52] of this is all of that is is there but I
[19:56] look to the revealing of the word of God
[19:59] all right because it's not going to
[20:01] create a
[20:02] Revival to find out Hillary's in the
[20:05] White House amen you know that's not
[20:08] going to do it that's that's not going
[20:10] to bring it it's going to be the
[20:11] revealing of God's word that will bring
[20:14] us to that well it's going to be the
[20:16] revealing of God's word that brings the
[20:20] uh the church World system after us
[20:24] too that's that's the point when God
[20:26] pours out himself among the bride then
[20:29] they're going to come after us according
[20:30] to the prophet well I've never looked
[20:33] forward and been pessimistic nor
[20:35] optimistic I just be at myself we just
[20:38] take it as we come day by day and
[20:41] believe that God will be there to supply
[20:43] whatever we have need of right because
[20:46] it's not something that we if we could
[20:49] try to plan to get ahead on doing
[20:51] something what good would it do because
[20:53] at 90% of the time our plans are are no
[20:55] good anyway they don't work out all
[20:58] right but to wait upon God and that's
[21:00] what we were talking about this morning
[21:02] about
[21:03] patience is to wait on God and believe
[21:06] that he gave the promise all right but
[21:09] we talked about too in the message this
[21:12] morning that God was waiting on
[21:15] us right all right then you know I keep
[21:20] quoting that where the Prophet said he's
[21:21] seen nothing outside of the Readiness of
[21:23] the
[21:24] Bride see all right then that's what we
[21:26] need to do is try to get ourselves ready
[21:29] for the day and the hour and the time
[21:31] and whatever it be and and wait with
[21:36] patience but in patience see not waiting
[21:40] just like we're sitting down
[21:42] waiting if you got a place that you got
[21:45] to be at you know you you're supposed to
[21:48] be at the airplane you know supposed to
[21:50] be down at the
[21:51] airport and you go over to the bus depot
[21:54] and you say well I'm
[21:55] waiting no that's the wrong place you
[21:58] got to be at the right spot the right
[22:00] thing of what's taking place and I do
[22:03] truly believe that we're in the last
[22:06] days you know a time is fastly running
[22:09] out on you and I all right that's not
[22:12] obscure tactic that's telling the truth
[22:15] all right if it don't one way or the
[22:17] other it's going to get us AG is going
[22:18] to get us or something anyway so that's
[22:21] going to be the point but I believe that
[22:23] God is
[22:24] waiting on you and
[22:27] I to stand up and accept a position of
[22:31] where we're at and believe
[22:32] it now every age I believe this church
[22:36] and I've always believed it this way and
[22:37] I've always taught it this way every age
[22:40] had a word for that age which you know
[22:43] what somebody had to stand up and
[22:46] declare
[22:48] that for that age right just because the
[22:51] messenger of the age came out with a
[22:55] message see I like I always said about
[22:58] Martin Luther sure he had the message of
[23:00] the just shall live by faith and you
[23:02] know the Catholic Church wasn't
[23:03] concerned about him I mean he was just
[23:05] one person they didn't get all upset
[23:07] when he began to do all those things and
[23:10] nail his thesis up and do those things
[23:13] that didn't bother him he just one
[23:14] person but when the people begin to
[23:19] stand up for what Luther had taught
[23:22] right and proclaimed for themselves and
[23:25] started pulling away then the Catholic
[23:28] Church got upset about it all right see
[23:31] then I
[23:32] believe that we're sitting here in the
[23:34] end time we've had the message it's been
[23:37] delivered unto us now it's time for
[23:40] somebody to say this is
[23:42] that all right and say it not by just
[23:46] head knowledge remember that was in the
[23:48] message of knowledge it's Holy Ghost
[23:50] knowledge you this is that that was
[23:52] spoken of in the scriptures all right
[23:55] and believing who we are all right why
[23:58] not because it is the last hour there's
[24:01] not another age to be promised
[24:04] anywhere is that true it's not another
[24:07] day or a time to be promised it's this
[24:10] is the day of salvation this is the end
[24:12] of all things all right why can't we
[24:14] didn't stand up and say all right I
[24:16] believe it right I believe it you know
[24:21] as I've always told you you got to
[24:24] confess that you're healed before you're
[24:26] healed right that's Bible before you're
[24:30] saved you got to confess that you're
[24:32] saved
[24:33] right confess with a mouth believe in
[24:35] the heart it's got to be done all right
[24:39] now it's not an automatic process for
[24:42] salvation to come it's on the basis of
[24:44] what you
[24:45] confess then God will come on the scene
[24:48] all right well then wouldn't the Rapture
[24:50] the chains be the same
[24:53] thing would not it be that somebody will
[24:56] say this is that
[24:59] we're
[25:00] here and believe it and let God make it
[25:04] manifest well I just don't believe it
[25:07] you know why that's that way you know
[25:09] why people make that statement because
[25:11] they're not prepared right they're not
[25:15] ready and they know they're not
[25:17] ready why is it you can be talking to
[25:20] somebody you know you mention the P you
[25:21] know I'm talking about denominationalism
[25:23] or people know nobody knows the day or
[25:26] the hour
[25:28] nobody knows these
[25:30] things well you're not saying anybody
[25:32] does you're just talking about the End
[25:33] of Time see they're not
[25:37] ready you
[25:39] know like I said this morning where was
[25:41] the little policeman at standing over
[25:43] there in Scotland or what it was when
[25:45] they ask him where the Revival was he
[25:46] said I'm the
[25:48] Revival well when are we going to start
[25:50] making this person on to you and I
[25:54] right the day and hour We're living to
[25:56] make it personal real to us and start
[26:00] saying we're here amen all right now so
[26:04] we talked about patience this
[26:06] morning and that's what I said in the
[26:08] message this morning you know that God
[26:11] has been waiting on the church we gave
[26:14] that quote this morning God has been
[26:16] waiting on the church the prophet said
[26:18] it's on uh I just ran it all while AG go
[26:20] I didn't give it to them it's on the
[26:22] message what was the Holy Ghost given
[26:23] for he's talking about he's pouring in
[26:25] his Spirit those that are in are resting
[26:28] out under in the grave or under the
[26:30] altar of God as the scripture says
[26:32] crying how long how long how much longer
[26:35] what how much longer they're not saying
[26:37] how long how long to avenge our blood
[26:39] right they're saying how much how long
[26:41] how long how much longer God's waiting
[26:44] on me and you the church is waiting on
[26:47] me and you adoption time when God can
[26:50] pour into us his fullness his power his
[26:54] resurrection that when the church and
[26:57] Christ become come so close together
[27:00] till Christ becomes visible Among Us and
[27:03] raises the dead and we go into Rapture
[27:06] all
[27:08] right so God's waiting on you and
[27:10] I now you say well well wait well some
[27:16] of us have been around long enough to
[27:17] know what I'm talking
[27:20] about it's been about 51 years since the
[27:24] prophet left the
[27:26] S don't you think God has been patiently
[27:31] waiting
[27:33] right God has been patiently
[27:37] waiting on somebody to stand
[27:40] up and say where we're
[27:43] at well we're not looking for a

[27:57] Revival yet it'll take them seven
[28:00] unknown Thunders well whatever you're
[28:02] expecting to come out of that
[28:05] situation you know what I mean by that
[28:07] cuz most of the people are waiting on
[28:09] brother brandom to come back Etc to do
[28:11] this to do that do that all if that's
[28:13] what you're waiting
[28:14] on we see this got to
[28:18] happen
[28:20] right irregardless of what you want to
[28:22] stay in your mind you're waiting on then
[28:24] it's got to happen well what not make
[28:27] why not get PR fired like I said about
[28:29] those Brothers I'm not throwing off on
[28:31] them they said they had that airplane
[28:33] that brother Brown was supposed to
[28:35] fly you know we said we got it out there
[28:39] we said it'll take us two years to get
[28:41] it
[28:45] flyable but the Lord can come anytime
[28:47] you
[28:48] know but it take two years to get the
[28:50] thing flyable he
[28:52] said well I've always told you what I am
[28:56] sorry if I believed it that way that
[28:59] airplane be sitting on that Runway brand
[29:01] new set of tires every day right brand
[29:04] new tank full of gas every day and
[29:07] cranked up and flew out and come back
[29:09] and
[29:11] landed see we make fun of the uh White
[29:15] Horse of
[29:17] Muhammad right we laugh at that but at
[29:21] least they change the horse that's
[29:25] right they don't let the horse stand
[29:27] there and stve to
[29:30] death you see what I'm saying I've
[29:32] always just been
[29:36] plain we are the people that's what God
[29:38] is waiting on that's right and I think
[29:42] his patience is about run
[29:44] out that's about as truthful as I can
[29:46] make
[29:47] it he's going to move on the scene yeah
[29:50] why because he promised it
[29:53] right you know why there's going to be a
[29:55] resurrection and a rapture
[29:59] because God promised
[30:01] it and it'll be right on time you
[30:04] remember nothing I of cater with with
[30:08] God so you think that we ought to be at
[30:10] least thinking about things that we've
[30:12] had you say well why are we here 50
[30:14] years later God's waiting on somebody to
[30:16] stand up and say we're here
[30:20] right why
[30:24] not but you know what is happening
[30:26] instead people are just falling off
[30:28] falling off dropping
[30:31] off yeah
[30:34] okay but he's waiting on the
[30:37] church 50 years since the prophets going
[30:41] that God has
[30:44] waited but it keeps getting worse and
[30:46] worse and worse and worse
[30:49] okay now get on to the message remember
[30:52] what I said we would put in to each
[30:55] stage first you must have Faith the new
[31:00] birth then you add virtue which is the
[31:04] same material as faith is or it won't
[31:08] vcan IE right Faith virtue knowledge
[31:12] temper all that's the same material
[31:14] called it's holy it's Holy
[31:16] Ghost material all right so then where
[31:19] are we talking about faith you had
[31:22] virtue you had knowledge remember the
[31:24] prophet if it's a right kind of
[31:26] knowledge if it's a right kind of Faith
[31:29] Temperance all right this morning
[31:31] getting down to
[31:34] patience patience you know that God has
[31:38] waiting on you and
[31:43] I to have these
[31:46] virtues what is he waiting
[31:50] on times running out Hillary in the
[31:52] White House coming after what do we got
[31:59] God's waiting on you and I to have these
[32:01] virtues a Rapture can't come without
[32:04] these virtues in an individual I'm
[32:06] talking Rapture chain the M twinkling an
[32:08] eye now those that die and go by the
[32:09] grave are going to come up and go in a
[32:10] Rapture right come on but those that are
[32:13] chained in a moment twinkling I don't
[32:15] tell me you're going to have a novice
[32:16] come walking up through there they
[32:18] didn't start the church off as a
[32:21] novice right he started the church off
[32:24] with a great
[32:26] stage right
[32:28] so what's he going to do now see see you
[32:32] must have
[32:34] patience before you can come to the
[32:36] point of talking about
[32:40] godliness
[32:42] right then remember these are the things
[32:47] that God expects us to add now he's gave
[32:51] us the
[32:53] material and you remember how I preached
[32:55] it how do we get these virtues
[33:00] they have to be by the opening of God's
[33:04] word right right not CA I'm in the
[33:08] message and I've done I'm older
[33:09] seniority and all y'all yeah I know I I
[33:12] I slept with the prophet I I ate with
[33:14] him I don't that's wonderful praise
[33:18] God but we're seniority getting us
[33:20] anything with
[33:23] God
[33:26] no you see that's why I said that like
[33:29] that this Wednesday night why is it that
[33:31] your family is not in the
[33:33] message I know that offend I know it
[33:36] does I know it ties but it ought to I
[33:40] mean for it too okay you mean to hurt
[33:43] our feelings no no I mean to tell you
[33:45] the
[33:47] truth have I become your enemy then
[33:49] because I tell you the
[33:53] truth Temperance our kids are watching
[33:56] us
[33:59] the neighbor is watching
[34:01] you you know
[34:03] right everybody works watching you
[34:08] amen and you claim to be something one
[34:11] day and there you are the other
[34:13] what
[34:15] okay remember these virtues we gave it
[34:20] where the Prophet was talking about
[34:22] it he expects us to have these or why
[34:26] would he tell
[34:28] add patience aders why would he tell it
[34:31] if it wasn't there expecting us to
[34:33] receive it all right now as I say and
[34:36] repeat it what he's given us the
[34:40] material now we've had 50
[34:43] years I'm talking about since the
[34:45] prophet left to sink 50 years to study
[34:48] the message we've only got one
[34:52] message that proclaims one gospel one
[34:56] God one Faith one Lord one baptism it's
[35:00] all one right
[35:04] right he's give us 50 years to study
[35:08] it you know if you were going to study
[35:10] to be a doctor and you studied 50 years
[35:12] that'd be something wouldn't
[35:14] it what of your requirements to be a
[35:17] doctor what tickles me to death is I
[35:19] think now I'm just going to say I know
[35:21] they have to have the interns but you go
[35:23] like eight years to college to be a
[35:26] doctor you know how how long it takes
[35:28] you to be a doctor to be a a
[35:31] veterinarian 12
[35:33] years oh I know there excuses animals
[35:36] are not all the same come on garbage can
[35:38] they think more of the animals than they
[35:40] do as
[35:41] humans they require 12 years to be a
[35:45] veterinarian 8 years to be a surgeon you
[35:52] know listen the prophet said these
[35:56] virtues what must come from the inside
[36:00] out right and that we must be partakers
[36:04] of his divine
[36:06] nature so they come from the inside out
[36:09] so then there's nothing we can
[36:14] manufactor and all we got to do is read
[36:17] the
[36:19] book
[36:21] you read the Bible read the message
[36:25] that's all God expects us to do
[36:29] right he's going to supply what we have
[36:32] need of from how much we've done
[36:37] that now you see why some gain quicker
[36:40] than
[36:43] others most of you know more a whole lot
[36:45] more about all these other things you
[36:48] know know than you know about the word
[36:49] of
[36:51] God
[36:53] right but now watch here we come okay
[36:57] can we going going come back to this
[36:58] statement in a
[37:00] minute you know that we come all the way
[37:02] up because we're going to talk about
[37:04] godliness you know that we come all the
[37:05] way up to Godliness and watch this
[37:09] statement you come all the way to
[37:11] Godliness godliness before he expects
[37:14] you to be like
[37:19] God
[37:23] right now let that choke a little
[37:26] while he he comes all the way to to this
[37:29] position all the way through faith
[37:31] virtue knowledge Temperance
[37:34] patience now he expects you to
[37:37] be like
[37:42] God
[37:44] right because what is
[37:49] godliness sure we know the
[37:51] definition is to be like
[37:54] God well now we got the only way you can
[37:56] be like God now listen the only way you
[37:58] can be like God is to have
[38:01] faith now in action not just talking
[38:05] Faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[38:12] patience he doesn't expect you to be
[38:14] like
[38:17] God until you come to
[38:23] Godliness
[38:26] W oh I didn't think of it like that well
[38:30] why is it that
[38:35] way to be like
[38:39] God first definition we'll get on down
[38:41] in a minute we'll read it it means
[38:44] Holiness well according to my Bible the
[38:46] it says that without Holiness no man
[38:51] shall see the Lord that's
[38:55] right now
[38:58] I'm laying a foundation for Wednesday
[39:00] night
[39:03] okay so then you got to come all the way
[39:05] to this place before he expects you to
[39:08] be like
[39:10] him now listen
[39:12] folks when you're born
[39:16] again you then have the nature of God in
[39:20] your
[39:21] soul as a child
[39:24] right an earnest
[39:29] right all
[39:31] right now he expects us to act like
[39:34] Christians at that
[39:37] stage right right you not supposed to
[39:41] act like the
[39:42] devil w't to act like a Christian at the
[39:45] new
[39:48] birth if not then he's not going to give
[39:51] you virtue
[39:58] now it don't
[40:00] click it don't click in what I'm
[40:04] saying you mean he waits he you have to
[40:07] you come all the way up to Godliness
[40:10] before you got to be like
[40:13] God yet he expects you to be like God
[40:16] when you're born again but that's only
[40:19] in the baby
[40:20] stage
[40:24] right come on are you following me amen
[40:27] right then it surely is a growth
[40:30] development sir it's not an automatic
[40:34] process that just when we we get born
[40:36] again we get
[40:39] everything well why did Peter say
[40:44] add are you with
[40:46] me this is background for a few minutes
[40:49] to for sun for Wednesday now why is it
[40:52] that it that God would what would be his
[40:55] whole point as you mean that he would
[40:58] give you the new birth he would even
[41:00] give you virtue even give you knowledge
[41:02] even give you Temperance even give you
[41:05] patience and he still doesn't act expect
[41:08] you to be like
[41:18] God come
[41:20] on I'm quoting the prophet whether you
[41:22] know it or not so you already to know I
[41:25] don't make statements without quoting
[41:31] okay so what is
[41:35] it there must be something about this
[41:37] that we're not
[41:40] comprehending and the main the main
[41:42] thing to me is that we're not
[41:44] comprehending the new
[41:47] birth because the new birth brings us
[41:50] the very nature of almighty
[41:52] God
[41:54] right but that's in a baby form that's
[41:56] not a growth that's not a full grown
[41:59] child we're talking about a growing in
[42:01] Grace and
[42:06] knowledge can you relate to any of the
[42:09] things that we've been talking
[42:13] about can you relate
[42:16] to that it's not just there just because
[42:19] you say it's
[42:21] there
[42:23] amen it's not there just because I've
[42:25] been in the message
[42:37] years why is it that most of the people
[42:39] of this message are
[42:42] backslid you said yet there's Millions
[42:44] yeah there's Millions counting the ones
[42:51] overseas but where is there really just
[42:53] an anchored group of people that
[42:58] is holding
[43:02] on
[43:07] okay but when you come to Godliness
[43:10] you've come all this way before he
[43:12] expects you to be like
[43:19] God well I don't I don't understand that
[43:23] I know you don't understand that because
[43:25] you're not listening to you're you're
[43:27] not praying to listen you're listening
[43:29] to refute instead of just wondering what
[43:32] somebody's
[43:33] saying instead of being serious about it
[43:35] and saying brother you're
[43:40] right God gives us a new
[43:43] birth but that's not all of it that's
[43:48] right well how do you get the rest of it
[43:51] like I said this morning people say oh
[43:54] we we right up here cuz we born in this
[43:57] age well how'd you get up
[44:00] there the only question I
[44:05] got Peter tells you how to get
[44:08] there but we there just because of the
[44:11] age or a time or
[44:15] something I'm
[44:19] sorry but one day you'll find
[44:24] out that I've got one goal and that's to
[44:26] try to get you and
[44:29] I to find our
[44:31] place to get where we're supposed to be
[44:34] and let God come on the
[44:36] scene all
[44:38] right okay what is
[44:43] godliness
[44:46] right just remember you can't jump rungs
[44:49] and go up you got to start at the bottom
[44:52] that's right and go up all right go
[44:55] ahead and pull number one up and let's
[44:56] get started
[44:58] this is paragraph 309 of the Statue of a
[45:00] perfect man then we're going to drop
[45:03] back come back
[45:05] through
[45:07] look after you done come from here to
[45:10] here to here to here to here to here now
[45:14] you're coming into the full stature now
[45:18] of a Son of
[45:20] God but you got to have
[45:23] this plus all
[45:25] this and you you can't even start until
[45:29] you get
[45:31] this right what's he saying you can't
[45:34] start till you get the new birth so the
[45:37] prophet what did he say one day the new
[45:39] birth is the most important thing in
[45:41] your
[45:43] life is the new birth cuz you can't even
[45:47] start without it now remember the black
[45:49] bird with the peacock feathers don't
[45:50] forget himc don't try to add it till you
[45:53] actually you're actually born again
[45:57] oh got to drop to don't try to add it
[45:59] till you're actually born again C you it
[46:02] won't
[46:04] work and you you can't make it
[46:08] work until you get a new birth it won't
[46:11] work that's what he
[46:14] said it'll come to this or this here
[46:17] it'll crumble somewhere what was we
[46:19] reading this morning where brother
[46:21] Brandon said if you come up and had you
[46:23] Faith virtue knowledge and temperance
[46:27] and your per your patience wasn't
[46:30] correct he said it'll crumble the whole
[46:34] thing why would brother R and
[46:37] say the
[46:39] gifts without the
[46:42] virtues is a stumbling
[46:44] block to the
[46:49] unbeliever
[46:50] okay now remember the black bird with
[46:52] the peacock feed don't don't try to add
[46:54] it till you actually born again cuz it
[46:56] won't work and you you can't make it
[46:58] work it come to this or this here it'll
[47:01] crumble somewhere but when you get down
[47:03] here a genuine Born Again Dove then you
[47:06] don't add nothing it adds to you see it
[47:10] comes on up all right coming into
[47:12] Perfection
[47:14] now all right if you're a true peacock
[47:17] you'll have peacock feathers right right
[47:21] amen you don't have to worry about it
[47:22] look at the next one now let's let's
[47:24] read paragraph 2 299
[47:27] but if you got genuine Faith then
[47:29] genuine ver then put genuine virtue to
[47:32] it then genuine knowledge then genuine
[47:34] Temperance then genuine patience you're
[47:36] moving right on up the line right now
[47:40] fifthly add godliness oh my godliness to
[47:45] be added what does godliness mean he
[47:47] said he looked it up in four five
[47:48] dictionary and couldn't find it finally
[47:50] brother Jeff they found it in the
[47:51] dictionary godliness means to be like
[47:55] God
[47:57] then
[47:59] what oh my after you got Fai virtue
[48:03] knowledge
[48:04] Temperance then be like God and you
[48:08] thought while ago I was just using my
[48:09] own thoughts right you're no better than
[48:12] that when I'm saying you can't do this
[48:14] you can't do that you can't have ver you
[48:17] can't have knowledge until and he don't
[48:19] expect you to have knowledge until you
[48:21] have all these other virtues that's
[48:23] right are you reading that's not the
[48:25] only quote but after you got Faith
[48:27] virtue knowledge temper patience then be
[48:29] like
[48:31] God God don't expect you to do
[48:36] it right you say I can't do that brother
[48:39] br oh yes you
[48:43] can that's what he says let me just read
[48:46] you a few scriptures here just a
[48:49] minute Matthew 5:48 we'll take this one
[48:51] and see what it sounds like Matthew 5:48
[48:54] and see if you're supposed to be like
[49:00] God you know the Bible says you're
[49:04] Gods right Jesus said
[49:08] so why all the virtue all the things
[49:12] that's in God is in
[49:16] you Matthew 5:48 be ye Jesus speaking in
[49:20] the Beatitudes now we're stopping right
[49:24] here today we're not going to get on to
[49:27] Matthew
[49:29] 5:48 that'll be Wednesday okay let's
[49:32] stay with what he says here let's stay
[49:35] with the point of what he says what is
[49:38] godliness to be like
[49:45] God to be like
[49:47] God then he brings it to a conclusion or
[49:50] thought of
[49:52] what that you are gods
[49:57] I see that's where everybody goes that's
[49:59] great people of the message no now in a
[50:01] way in a way you can say
[50:04] that brother Brown didn't say it that
[50:06] way did he what did he say he said not
[50:08] such a thing as saying in a way it's
[50:10] either it or not
[50:13] right
[50:15] right all right look now holding it to
[50:20] what holding it to the point that we're
[50:23] going to talk about godliness
[50:27] as to be like
[50:29] God and then our thought will be
[50:35] today of your
[50:42] Gods well if you can't
[50:45] comprehend that you're
[50:48] Gods you certainly can't comprehend
[50:54] godliness cuz the only thing we we think
[50:56] about like uh godliness is be like God
[50:59] we just think about being
[51:01] good that's part of it but there's a lot
[51:04] more goes with it besid just being
[51:08] good is that all you think about God
[51:10] that he was good I can show you a God
[51:13] that one day will destroy every moving
[51:16] living human being that is not in the
[51:18] right place
[51:21] amen right I'll show you a God in the
[51:25] word that says go out and destroy that
[51:28] whole
[51:29] nation men women children babies kill
[51:33] them all that's
[51:36] right and he's
[51:40] God it's not just being good is to say
[51:43] to be like God well I'll just be
[51:45] good that's part of
[51:48] it but that order had its basis in the
[51:51] faith of the new birth
[51:57] okay you're a little slow this afternoon
[51:59] so it's a good point I
[52:03] guess let's continue on but like I said
[52:06] now we're dividing we're not going to
[52:08] get on to that Matthew
[52:10] 5:48 we're just going to get on to the
[52:12] point of to be like God is to be
[52:19] God because that's what the scripture
[52:22] says right but I want to make sure you
[52:25] follow me what I'm talking about cuz I
[52:27] gave this this morning and I want you to
[52:29] follow go ahead number three taking some
[52:31] Blasphemous names brother Brown makes an
[52:34] outstanding
[52:35] statement I want to make sure you get
[52:38] this to have an understanding to my
[52:41] knowledge I had Temperance self-control
[52:44] I like that my country T the crown my
[52:46] soul with self soul with self-control
[52:48] from SE The Shining Seas patience oh my
[52:51] tested don't you worry Satan will come
[52:54] we'll count them for you I'm climing up
[52:56] the ladder now now watch
[52:59] him I've added virtue so he means you
[53:02] have to have the faith right I've added
[53:04] virtue knowledge
[53:06] Temperance now I got to have
[53:09] patience see that was the point we was
[53:11] covering this morning watch him I still
[53:14] ain't got the Holy
[53:17] Ghost that's what I said those are the
[53:20] quotes that people use to prove their
[53:23] point that we don't have the Holy Ghost
[53:26] like the disciples had the Holy
[53:28] Ghost
[53:32] amen I can go along with that to one
[53:34] point but I can't on all the point cuz
[53:36] on the day of Pentecost that's where
[53:38] people don't get
[53:39] it on the day of Pentecost you got two
[53:44] situations one group in the upper room
[53:47] that had been tutored for three and a
[53:49] half years maybe not all of them cuz you
[53:51] got 120 up there but they'd been
[53:54] tutored the group downstairs are the the
[53:56] 3,000 heard one
[53:58] sermon
[54:01] right brother brandham said the
[54:06] disciples had these virtues and I cover
[54:09] up love because he said The Headstone
[54:11] ain't come
[54:13] yet that's better known as what would be
[54:16] called a faith of the
[54:20] fathers so if you're just a born again
[54:22] novice a born again Earnest of our
[54:25] inheritance we don't have it like the
[54:27] disciples had it as the faith of the
[54:30] fathers amen that's
[54:34] sensible that don't mean it ain't here
[54:36] for us right and that's where the people
[54:38] talk about that we don't have the Holy
[54:40] Ghost like they had on the day of
[54:43] Pentecost if you got the new birth you
[54:45] got it exactly the way it was on the day
[54:47] of Pentecost cuz that's the only way to
[54:48] have it right right so what's he
[54:53] saying you get born again
[54:57] it's a great wonderful climb right we're
[54:59] good up to here we get up to brother
[55:01] cless
[55:05] later I can say we don't have the Holy
[55:09] Spirit that's what he
[55:12] says but what's he
[55:15] saying well you're trying to interpret
[55:19] it don't play games with me and I won't
[55:21] with you okay because hey you take that
[55:24] and twist it on the other side and say
[55:26] of the Prophet said we ain't got the
[55:28] Holy Ghost yet that's your
[55:31] interpretation now you've done the same
[55:33] thing I have you've made a statement
[55:35] from your
[55:36] interpretation so don't play with me
[55:39] it's too late it's what I said we're
[55:41] we're we're here at the end of all of
[55:43] these things and we better get settled
[55:45] down into something because it ain't
[55:47] going to be playing games when they come
[55:49] after
[55:50] you I gave you the quotes s the other
[55:53] night about if you didn't get them make
[55:55] sure you get a copy of them I got
[55:56] someone on my desk where brother rown
[55:58] says two times thus sayith the Lord
[56:00] there will be a
[56:05] persecution well if we believe the end
[56:06] of time is close then things better
[56:09] start
[56:12] happening well brother they you scare me
[56:15] my
[56:16] kids if you can't have faith for your
[56:18] kids today in the Rapture to come
[56:20] tomorrow what are you going to have
[56:22] anyway sorry but look what he said he
[56:25] comes up he said I got
[56:27] patience that's a long ways up right
[56:30] Faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[56:32] patience he said I ain't got the Holy
[56:34] Ghost
[56:38] yet when he done told you you had the
[56:40] holy ghost at the new birth and faith
[56:43] that is the Holy Ghost
[56:48] amen then after I had patience I had
[56:52] godliness you know what that is like God
[56:55] I add that that don't misbehave myself
[56:58] go like a Christian gentleman ought to
[57:00] be let that not be a put on something in
[57:03] me that not be a put on something in me
[57:05] the love of God just boiling you see not
[57:08] say boy I could do this but maybe I'd
[57:11] better not see ha it's there anyhow he
[57:15] said it's a birth I've been birthed into
[57:18] this into this into this into this and
[57:20] this and then the love of God Christ
[57:23] comes down and seals all that up in me
[57:27] for
[57:30] service there's not seven new
[57:32] births there's one you birth amen but
[57:35] the seven birth into
[57:37] virtues cuz you birth
[57:40] into virtue you're birth into knowledge
[57:43] you're birth into Temperance you're
[57:44] birth into
[57:46] patience right a birth means a coming
[57:48] forth in
[57:50] two
[57:52] right so then we do need
[57:57] these things to be like the
[57:59] disciples why was Peter trying to tell
[58:01] you where to come
[58:03] to trying to tell you to come where he
[58:05] was
[58:08] at
[58:10] right but that's where we got that point
[58:13] right like I said this morning I wasn't
[58:15] the one that wrote the book over to back
[58:17] close to the back of the book brother
[58:18] Brown say statue of a perfect man he
[58:20] said fill me up Lord with these things
[58:22] Faith virtue knowledge temper fa and
[58:23] godliness brotherly kindness and love he
[58:26] said that I may teach others Apostles
[58:28] prophets evangelist pastors and teachers
[58:31] that they may bring these virtues into
[58:34] the
[58:37] body but see we don't need a
[58:40] pastor we don't need these
[58:44] things we just get it straight from the
[58:47] prophet the most backsliding people
[58:49] you've ever seen is what I told a man
[58:50] one time I said you show me that type of
[58:53] people and I'll show you back toling
[58:54] bunch of people
[58:56] oh of course
[58:58] no okay all right but
[59:02] listen what
[59:06] is
[59:08] godliness strong concordance go ahead
[59:10] number
[59:12] four it
[59:14] means godliness it means Holiness now
[59:18] see the reason to give those words you
[59:19] can take this and go back up and click
[59:21] on and get more wordings with it it'll
[59:24] be different wordings to be used but
[59:26] reason it's got that like that always it
[59:28] will give you the main number first
[59:30] godliness or if it's patience it gives
[59:32] you patience first and then comes down
[59:35] all right listen it means Holiness
[59:37] without Holiness no man can see the
[59:39] Lord it means
[59:42] reverence now that's what this godliness
[59:45] means the prophets done told us is to be
[59:47] like
[59:48] God now it means respect piety which
[59:52] means reverence towards God see piety
[59:55] towards God reverence respect and all
[59:58] toward God it means
[1:00:01] godliness what a wonderful
[1:00:03] word of
[1:00:07] godliness but remember the point I
[1:00:12] said that we're going to deal with
[1:00:15] talking about godliness to be like God
[1:00:18] we know that definition we've got those
[1:00:20] things
[1:00:21] there but let's deal with it in the
[1:00:24] scriptures of what brother random gave
[1:00:26] us on that quote while
[1:00:29] ago cuz when he was listed Matthew 5:48
[1:00:32] Matthew 5:48 says Be You therefore
[1:00:33] perfect even as your father in Heaven is
[1:00:35] perfect Matthew 4 5:48 doesn't say
[1:00:37] you're are
[1:00:40] Gods right brother BR said he'll give
[1:00:44] you a couple of scriptures he mentioned
[1:00:47] Matthew 28 I mean mentions
[1:00:51] uh they're about to being
[1:00:53] perfect but he starts off by talking
[1:00:56] about your Gods you know if you're going
[1:00:59] to be like
[1:01:00] God now let's take a
[1:01:03] definition we think and we've been
[1:01:05] taught to be like God is means that uh
[1:01:08] we know we're not really nothing and all
[1:01:10] but we're doing the best we can do and
[1:01:11] we're trying the best we can do so we'll
[1:01:13] just be likeing the best we can
[1:01:16] be have you ever looked up the word
[1:01:23] like never looked up the word like
[1:01:28] the word like doesn't mean a second
[1:01:31] person you said I don't want to be like
[1:01:33] brother K that that's our human
[1:01:36] terminologies but in scriptural
[1:01:38] terminologies like is the same image
[1:01:42] that's why it says in in Genesis let us
[1:01:45] make man in our image and our
[1:01:49] likeness cuz the word image is not
[1:01:52] something like
[1:01:53] it it's not a photostatic copy
[1:01:56] or a
[1:01:58] cologne it means the same
[1:02:03] person just in another
[1:02:07] body then we know for certain Jesus was
[1:02:10] God
[1:02:14] right we understand that
[1:02:17] perfectly well now let's just read some
[1:02:19] scriptures that goes with it we'll go as
[1:02:21] far as we can we'll break off go ahead
[1:02:24] with number five
[1:02:26] let's see what Jesus has to say about
[1:02:31] something my sheep hear my voice and I
[1:02:33] know them they follow me and I give unto
[1:02:35] them eternal life his life okay and they
[1:02:39] shall never perish neither shall any man
[1:02:41] pluck them out of my hand my Father
[1:02:43] which gave them me is greater than I and
[1:02:46] no man is able to pluck them from my
[1:02:49] father's hand I and my father are
[1:02:52] one now watching you know what brother
[1:02:55] around said with would bring the World
[1:02:56] Council of churches after
[1:02:59] you he said when the bride begins to say
[1:03:03] I am my father are one and these other
[1:03:06] things he said they'll come after us cuz
[1:03:10] that's what they done with the Lord
[1:03:11] Jesus he turned around he said I and my
[1:03:14] father one now I wish you would think
[1:03:17] about it but we don't have to drop cuz
[1:03:18] it's way on down but he gets on down a
[1:03:20] little further in this same writing and
[1:03:22] he says if you don't believe me he said
[1:03:26] you believe the works cuz he said they
[1:03:28] testify of who I am was it not true that
[1:03:32] Nicodemus said we know that thou art a
[1:03:35] man come from God cuz no man can do the
[1:03:37] things you're doing unless he be of
[1:03:40] God right come on when Jesus said I my
[1:03:43] father one then the Jews took up stones
[1:03:46] again to Stone him and Jesus answered
[1:03:47] many good works have I showed you from
[1:03:50] my father for which of those Works do
[1:03:52] you Stone me the Jews answered him
[1:03:55] saying for a good work we Stone thee
[1:04:00] not but for
[1:04:02] blasphemy and because that thou being a
[1:04:05] man maketh thyself
[1:04:10] God and Jesus knew how to answer them
[1:04:12] didn't
[1:04:13] he he trapped them with their own words
[1:04:17] that's a good way to solve an argument
[1:04:19] with
[1:04:21] anybody watch him trap him Jesus
[1:04:24] answered it is
[1:04:26] is it not written in your
[1:04:32] law now they were the guys that noted to
[1:04:35] the
[1:04:35] letter and he called it their
[1:04:38] law because it was given to them look is
[1:04:43] it not written in your law I said you're
[1:04:49] Gods if he called them unto whom to whom
[1:04:53] the word of God came and the scripture
[1:04:55] came not be
[1:04:58] broken say ye of him whom the father has
[1:05:01] Sanctified and sent into the world th
[1:05:03] blasphemy is because I said I'm a Son of
[1:05:05] God if I do not the works of my father
[1:05:08] believeing not yours at but if I do
[1:05:10] though you believe not me believe the
[1:05:12] works that you may know and believe that
[1:05:15] the father is in me and I in you Jesus
[1:05:18] said your own
[1:05:21] law has condemned you
[1:05:25] now watch you where's that at in the
[1:05:29] scripture go ahead to number
[1:05:32] six
[1:05:35] Psalms
[1:05:39] 82 God standeth in the congregation of
[1:05:41] the mighty he judges among the gods how
[1:05:44] long will you judge unjustly and accept
[1:05:46] the persons of the
[1:05:48] wicked defend the poor and fatherless to
[1:05:52] Justice to defend the poor and
[1:05:54] fatherless do justice to The Afflicted
[1:05:56] and needy deliver the poor and needy rid
[1:05:59] them out of the hand of the
[1:06:02] wicked they know not neither will they
[1:06:05] understand they walk on in darkness
[1:06:07] that's the other parts of the people
[1:06:10] right all the foundation of the Earth
[1:06:12] are out of course I have
[1:06:16] said ye are
[1:06:20] gods and all of
[1:06:23] you are children
[1:06:26] of the most
[1:06:31] high the children of
[1:06:33] God are his offspring
[1:06:37] right then if you're his offspring
[1:06:39] you're his
[1:06:42] child if he was God you're
[1:06:45] God oh but now that's just a little bit
[1:06:47] too far no that is stand far
[1:06:53] enough I ain't far enough right right
[1:06:57] you're not understanding what it means
[1:06:59] to be a child of
[1:07:02] God I thought we believe that Jesus was
[1:07:06] not a second
[1:07:07] person that's what I thought now right
[1:07:11] and by saying he's not a second person
[1:07:13] then it means he's not even the first
[1:07:15] person because you can have other
[1:07:17] persons but he is the person of almighty
[1:07:19] God
[1:07:21] Amen now if his offsprings are his
[1:07:24] children who are they
[1:07:29] you don't realize what the new birth
[1:07:30] makes you
[1:07:32] Church the new birth makes you God made
[1:07:35] manifest in another
[1:07:38] form called a bride or called children
[1:07:41] of God and look what he says in the Old
[1:07:45] Testament Jesus is quoting back to him
[1:07:48] he's quoting probably back from some of
[1:07:50] the thought that you could pick up
[1:07:51] through the scriptures but I have said
[1:07:54] you're gods and all of you are the
[1:07:58] children of the most
[1:08:01] high what about
[1:08:05] that going on to the next one number
[1:08:11] seven Isaiah
[1:08:13] 41 when the poor needy needy seek water
[1:08:16] and there is none and their tongue
[1:08:18] faileth for thirst I the Lord will hear
[1:08:20] them I the Lord I the the god of Israel
[1:08:24] will not forsake them him I will open
[1:08:26] rivers in high places and fountains in
[1:08:28] the midst of the valley that's what he
[1:08:30] thinks of his people right I will make
[1:08:32] the Wilderness a pool of water and the
[1:08:34] dry land Springs of water I will plant
[1:08:36] in the wilderness the Cedar and the
[1:08:38] sidam tree and the Myrtle and the oil
[1:08:40] tree that's what he thinks of his family
[1:08:42] I will set it in the desert you know the
[1:08:45] fur tree and the pine and the Box tree
[1:08:47] together and they may see and know that
[1:08:50] I consider and understand together that
[1:08:53] the hand of the Lord ha done this
[1:08:56] and the Holy One hath of Israel hath
[1:08:59] created
[1:09:00] it produce your cause sayith the Lord
[1:09:05] bring forth your strong
[1:09:07] reasonings sayith the king of Jacob let
[1:09:10] them bring them forth and show us what
[1:09:11] shall happen let them show the former
[1:09:15] things that they be that we may consider
[1:09:18] them and know the latter end of them and
[1:09:20] declare us things for to come show the
[1:09:24] things that are to come here
[1:09:27] after that we may
[1:09:30] know that you are
[1:09:35] Gods y do good or do
[1:09:39] evil that we may be dismayed and behold
[1:09:43] it
[1:09:44] together show the things that are to
[1:09:47] come
[1:09:48] Hereafter that we may
[1:09:50] know that you are gods
[1:09:56] so to be godliness is going to have to
[1:09:58] deal with being
[1:10:02] God course we don't want to go it that
[1:10:04] way do we now that's just going a little
[1:10:06] bit too far now oh now now a son well
[1:10:10] what is the Son of
[1:10:12] God uh you shouldn't agreed with me
[1:10:14] while ago
[1:10:16] okay you agreed that Jesus was not a
[1:10:19] second
[1:10:23] person that he was the person of
[1:10:26] God then what are his
[1:10:29] offspring his sons and
[1:10:31] daughters I thought the Bible
[1:10:35] says there in Romans
[1:10:39] 8 I thought it said something like that
[1:10:42] we
[1:10:43] were ARS of
[1:10:46] Salvation And how that we were join ours
[1:10:50] with Jesus
[1:10:52] Christ so every what he's got I've got
[1:10:56] and what he is I
[1:10:59] am see that's why people wouldn't
[1:11:01] understand in brother
[1:11:03] brandham when I first heard this man
[1:11:05] talking we call William brandham that
[1:11:07] was what I was looking at I was looking
[1:11:08] at a man that was talking a strange
[1:11:10] language to the religious world no
[1:11:13] wonder they couldn't follow
[1:11:17] him but no wonder he would tell it and
[1:11:20] he'd say you killed him back there for
[1:11:21] that and you doing it now
[1:11:25] CU you're killing the the the respect
[1:11:28] the things that he was speaking of you
[1:11:31] crucified and there and the Bible said
[1:11:32] he crucify him
[1:11:34] again put him to an open shame the
[1:11:36] scripture
[1:11:37] says listening to a man that spake like
[1:11:41] he was
[1:11:44] God and that he was telling I know what
[1:11:47] the Bible says about it we' got them in
[1:11:49] here we're going to read some more you
[1:11:52] call them Gods to whom the word of God
[1:11:54] come to that's the
[1:11:57] prophets the prophets were called Gods
[1:12:02] amen Moses God said what I'll make you
[1:12:08] God and Aaron to be your
[1:12:14] Prophet then we know the human side of
[1:12:16] it
[1:12:17] right but Moses stepped out with the
[1:12:20] word he was God when he stepped back he
[1:12:22] was
[1:12:22] Moses but I'll remind you
[1:12:25] he stepped out and he was God and
[1:12:27] brought the word when he stepped back as
[1:12:28] Moses they couldn't look on his
[1:12:34] face
[1:12:36] right because it was too much
[1:12:39] there
[1:12:41] okay what about
[1:12:44] it do you think the children of God has
[1:12:47] God made manifest another
[1:12:50] form I
[1:12:52] do there's where you godliness comes in
[1:12:56] to be like God not to be like God
[1:12:58] because he's one image and we're another
[1:13:00] but we're trying to act like him and be
[1:13:02] like
[1:13:04] him that's not God
[1:13:07] in that's not your prophet's definition
[1:13:09] your Prophet gave the definition we're
[1:13:11] going to read it again he gave the
[1:13:15] definition and immediately turned to the
[1:13:18] scriptures your God's and immediately
[1:13:21] determined Matthew 5:48 to be his point
[1:13:26] that you're
[1:13:27] perfect well ain't none of us
[1:13:31] perfect I think it's time to get rid of
[1:13:33] some of that after 50 years of hearing
[1:13:37] it ain't good to bring
[1:13:42] it what about
[1:13:49] it and I thought now come on we're going
[1:13:53] to solve it all the way through
[1:13:55] we're going to talk about the prophets
[1:13:57] were
[1:13:58] gods to the
[1:14:01] people but we're going to remember that
[1:14:03] the greatest of all prophets was John
[1:14:05] the
[1:14:07] Baptist
[1:14:09] right is that
[1:14:11] scripture but we better remember the
[1:14:13] rest the least in the kingdom is greater
[1:14:16] than
[1:14:18] John we remember that that's why I love
[1:14:21] the Bible
[1:14:22] see like what one brother said he said I
[1:14:25] read it you know I found it still says
[1:14:26] the same thing well you know that's good
[1:14:29] it don't change all right now we claim
[1:14:32] to believe a prophet's message
[1:14:35] right you know we claim to believe a
[1:14:37] prophet's message so we claim to say
[1:14:40] well okay if we have any question about
[1:14:41] anything we just go to the prophet we
[1:14:43] ask the prophet what
[1:14:46] right go we're not like to denominations
[1:14:48] that got to ask the high priest or the
[1:14:50] big guy in the front or who this is or
[1:14:52] that is
[1:14:55] hey did you see the other day what Trump
[1:14:56] done you think that old boy ain't
[1:15:01] smart you know that in the paper now I
[1:15:03] am quoting that you know that Jensen
[1:15:06] Franklin Free Chapel
[1:15:09] Pastor had already been chosen to be one
[1:15:11] of his advisors so would Jerry fwell
[1:15:18] Jr has done been chosen not the senior
[1:15:20] now I don't know he may be dead but
[1:15:23] Jerry fwell Jr in Jensen Franklin it
[1:15:26] pastors the Free Chapel Church of in
[1:15:28] Gainsville and done been pick to be his
[1:15:34] advisors oh
[1:15:37] rude
[1:15:38] right now listen so let's read a few
[1:15:42] things from Brother randam about this
[1:15:44] point of year
[1:15:47] gods and see if we can follow it and see
[1:15:49] what the that the Lord Jesus is really
[1:15:51] saying when he says you are Gods he told
[1:15:53] them you are gods
[1:15:55] now remember Paul on Mars
[1:15:59] Hill you remember what he
[1:16:01] said you know they had all these images
[1:16:03] and all these images sitting around and
[1:16:05] then it just probably had one little old
[1:16:06] Blank Space sitting there you know
[1:16:08] probably had a little stool fixed or
[1:16:10] whatever and he he said uh uh what's
[1:16:13] that
[1:16:14] father and that said uh well you know
[1:16:17] we've got about 4,000 Gods up here but
[1:16:20] just in case we miss one of
[1:16:22] them said that's to the unknown God
[1:16:25] God what Paul say Paul said okay that's
[1:16:29] good I'll just take
[1:16:31] that he said let me talk to you about
[1:16:33] this unknown
[1:16:36] God
[1:16:39] right and he said you say and so does
[1:16:43] your
[1:16:43] poets that we are his
[1:16:48] offspring now was Paul speaking of a God
[1:16:51] in heaven or somebody to come need to
[1:16:53] take the stool in front of him or was he
[1:16:56] speaking of what he had in his own
[1:16:58] life
[1:17:02] right he said you say and your poets are
[1:17:05] right he said paraphrase just a
[1:17:08] little and
[1:17:10] said we are his
[1:17:14] offspring okay brother Brandon we want
[1:17:16] to talk about this a little bit let's
[1:17:18] goe with number8 which is the deity of
[1:17:21] Jesus Christ 1949
[1:17:25] you cannot be saved only by accepting J
[1:17:29] Christ by the Holy Spirit if he's in you
[1:17:31] he's the power of God live by it he's
[1:17:34] God in you the Bible said and we thank
[1:17:36] God it's is upon me oh God and Jesus
[1:17:39] said listen the Pharisees answered said
[1:17:42] you make yourself
[1:17:44] God said isn't it written in your law
[1:17:48] you're
[1:17:51] Gods see they going to have to break
[1:17:53] that out of their scriptures you know
[1:17:55] okay he made Moses a God to Pharaoh
[1:18:00] once and he made you a God to the people
[1:18:04] that's right and you this morning are
[1:18:07] written Epistles of God your your lives
[1:18:11] are of God and even carries that Holy
[1:18:16] Ghost now what are we goe to the next
[1:18:19] resurrection of
[1:18:22] Lazarus that's what's the matter with
[1:18:24] the Pentecost people they don't
[1:18:26] recognize who they are you're Sons and
[1:18:28] Daughters of God you have in your hand
[1:18:31] look then Jesus it was one time quoted
[1:18:33] in the scripture you're
[1:18:35] gods look deity I'm a part of Charles
[1:18:39] brandom because I was born of Charles
[1:18:41] brandom my Daddy I'm a part of him I got
[1:18:44] a forehead like him my hair was like him
[1:18:47] I'm a small man like him I'm in the
[1:18:49] nature like him God he's my dad and if
[1:18:51] we become in spirit sons of God deity
[1:18:54] dwell DS in the man Hallelujah then you
[1:18:57] talk about blind eyes being
[1:19:01] open they said nothing impossible to
[1:19:05] God God says nothing impossible with
[1:19:09] you right if you
[1:19:12] believe not with God but you deity in
[1:19:15] the man the very God that stood back
[1:19:18] there on the mythical platform of the
[1:19:20] eternities and roll World off of his
[1:19:22] hands and created these things things
[1:19:25] give you the privilege to be his son and
[1:19:28] you're a part of him and God dwells in
[1:19:31] mankind and man himself is deity
[1:19:34] Allelujah there you are it might choke
[1:19:37] you but study over that a little while
[1:19:39] see he is God dwells in man and man
[1:19:43] becomes the Son of God not him in
[1:19:46] himself but the Holy Spirit that's in
[1:19:48] him is God the Creator lives in the
[1:19:50] creation oh my how I think of that then
[1:19:53] stand with an unwaver bring Faith and
[1:19:55] ask God what you will it'll be done unto
[1:19:57] you there he
[1:20:00] is which one will God
[1:20:04] hear an
[1:20:08] angel or a son of
[1:20:11] God he said he you're a Son of God
[1:20:15] first go ahead to the next testimony of
[1:20:17] Jesus
[1:20:21] Christ you see if a man does not have
[1:20:24] the Holy Spirit he cannot believe those
[1:20:27] things good point because when a man is
[1:20:29] born to the spirit of God he becomes a
[1:20:31] Son of God his nature is likened unto
[1:20:34] God that's the reason Jesus said did not
[1:20:37] it say in your laws you're
[1:20:40] Gods
[1:20:42] because you're an attributes of
[1:20:46] God an attribute of God is a part of
[1:20:50] God right go to the next
[1:20:55] of the discernment of
[1:20:57] spirits now the spirit of God working in
[1:21:00] man makes man act like God no wonder
[1:21:03] Jesus said is it not is not it written
[1:21:06] you're gods and they called him God to
[1:21:08] whom the spirit of God came to how can
[1:21:11] you condemn me then when I am the Son of
[1:21:13] God if you could see the spirit of God
[1:21:16] in Moses which he was God Moses was a
[1:21:19] god Joseph was a God the prophets were
[1:21:20] Gods the Bible said they were they were
[1:21:23] Gods because it they had completely
[1:21:26] surrendered themselves to the spirit of
[1:21:29] God that they were working for the glory
[1:21:32] of God and when a man is so Anointed
[1:21:34] with the spirit now that just go real
[1:21:37] deep under the fifth rib on the left
[1:21:39] side when a man is Anointed of the
[1:21:42] spirit of God his habits his actions and
[1:21:45] everything is God moving in
[1:21:48] him sometimes he's
[1:21:51] misjudged but just think about it
[1:21:57] one more then we'll get into some
[1:21:59] scriptures God hiding in Simplicity but
[1:22:02] an aluer in New Mexico confess your sins
[1:22:05] upon the blood of Jesus Christ it omits
[1:22:06] it puts it in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:22:08] and to be remembered no more against you
[1:22:10] at all now where is the church today
[1:22:12] Brethren if we are born to be sons of
[1:22:15] God and Jesus himself said said if
[1:22:18] you're law if your own law said ye are
[1:22:21] Gods amateur Gods with control of the
[1:22:23] Earth he said if they call them Gods
[1:22:26] unto whom the word of the God come to
[1:22:28] which was the prophets the word of the
[1:22:30] Lord comes to the prophets prophet and
[1:22:33] if you'll call them Gods how do you
[1:22:36] condemn me he said when I say I'm the
[1:22:38] Son of
[1:22:39] God what about
[1:22:42] it what do you think about your are
[1:22:47] Gods well that's only for the prophets
[1:22:50] well we gave them in there we're talking
[1:22:52] about the children so it's all right
[1:22:54] with me but that's you're not going to
[1:22:56] listen to that anyway you're going to
[1:22:57] hold to the prophets were
[1:22:59] Gods
[1:23:01] well if you're going to hold to that why
[1:23:03] don't you worship brother brandom as
[1:23:06] deity
[1:23:08] oh
[1:23:10] oh we're not that
[1:23:13] far well we don't worship deity and E
[1:23:16] each other do
[1:23:17] we I don't worship the god in you
[1:23:24] the God in Me is the one I
[1:23:27] worship not the god of William
[1:23:30] bradam no
[1:23:32] way see you're getting in the wrong
[1:23:34] place when you start talking about cuz
[1:23:36] God is a personal God to each and every
[1:23:38] one of
[1:23:40] us well brother d i Jesus was in brother
[1:23:44] brand when I worshiped Jesus be real
[1:23:45] careful you're getting very
[1:23:48] close to your
[1:23:50] deity and I'm a firm believer in deity
[1:23:54] with we stand up Jeffersonville Indiana
[1:23:56] right after coming to the message and I
[1:23:57] walk up to a man up there and he starts
[1:23:59] talking about brother brandham being
[1:24:00] deity I said I'll tell you what I'll go
[1:24:03] along with you if you'll go along with
[1:24:04] me he said what I said that brother
[1:24:07] right there he we we say he's got the
[1:24:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost he's got the
[1:24:10] new birth he said okay I said right now
[1:24:15] I'll go along with you if you go along
[1:24:16] with this
[1:24:18] way that new birth in him is the spirit
[1:24:20] of almighty God that's deity dwelling in
[1:24:23] him
[1:24:24] that's right right take away gifts and
[1:24:27] signs and wonders put brother brandom on
[1:24:29] the other side I said it's the same God
[1:24:32] isn't it he said oh
[1:24:35] no well they would no need a
[1:24:38] talking right because he was believing
[1:24:40] brother BR was
[1:24:42] de but I was explaining him brother BR
[1:24:45] said any believer that takes the word of
[1:24:47] God upon his lips one time he say is as
[1:24:49] deity the other time you say that is
[1:24:51] deity
[1:24:56] right let's read a few scriptures real
[1:24:58] fast okay pull all these up on the end
[1:25:00] brother there they'll be on one you can
[1:25:03] do like you done this morning we'll just
[1:25:04] read okay I exhort take it from 1
[1:25:07] Timothy 2 1-3 I exhort therefore that
[1:25:11] first of all supplications prayer
[1:25:12] intercessions and giv of thanks be made
[1:25:15] for all
[1:25:16] man for kings and for all that are in
[1:25:19] Authority that we may lead a quiet and
[1:25:22] Peaceable life in all good godliness and
[1:25:26] honesty for this is good and acceptable
[1:25:29] in the sight of God
[1:25:31] godliness 1 Timothy 47 and8 but refuse
[1:25:36] profane and wi wise fables and excuse
[1:25:39] thyself rather excuse me and exercise
[1:25:42] thyself rather unto
[1:25:46] godliness
[1:25:48] exercise but Godly exercise profit
[1:25:50] little but godliness is profit unto all
[1:25:53] things
[1:25:55] having promise of the life that is now
[1:25:58] is and that which is to come so we can
[1:26:01] exercise godliness we need to but then
[1:26:03] not godly exercise not to but godliness
[1:26:06] is profitable to everything you know to
[1:26:08] live like God to be like God go ahead 1
[1:26:12] Timothy 6 3 and 6 If any man Teach
[1:26:15] otherwise and consent not to Wholesome
[1:26:17] words even the words of our Lord Jesus
[1:26:20] and to the
[1:26:22] doctrine which is according
[1:26:25] to
[1:26:27] Godliness oh it's a
[1:26:32] Doctrine
[1:26:33] remember Holiness without no man can see
[1:26:36] God he is proud knowing nothing but
[1:26:39] dating about questions and stri of words
[1:26:41] whereof cometh even to strive really
[1:26:43] okay perverse disputing of men of
[1:26:46] corrupt minds and destitute of the truth
[1:26:49] supposing that gain is godliness from
[1:26:52] such withdraw thyself
[1:26:54] but godliness with contentment is great
[1:26:59] gain you remember see it comes to my
[1:27:01] mind that brother Randon was talking to
[1:27:04] those guys cuz it was somewhere overseas
[1:27:06] or something and they got up and told
[1:27:08] that they were this poor evangelist but
[1:27:10] yet that God came on the scene with them
[1:27:13] and they they had Cadillacs and had all
[1:27:15] kind of things you remember him telling
[1:27:17] that brother said that ain't
[1:27:19] right he said game like that is not
[1:27:22] showing godliness or truth
[1:27:27] he was telling them oh when I got saved
[1:27:28] I had to got a fleet of Cadillacs I got
[1:27:30] all
[1:27:32] these you certainly couldn't put that in
[1:27:34] the scripture where Peter and John said
[1:27:36] what Cadillacs Have I
[1:27:41] None right I to wake you up okay
[1:27:48] next 1 Timothy 6:1 but thou oh man of
[1:27:52] God flee these things and follow after
[1:27:55] righteousness what are we to follow
[1:27:56] after
[1:27:58] righteousness godliness Faith love
[1:28:01] patience meekness look like he's putting
[1:28:04] us in a pretty good place with God in
[1:28:05] this don't it 2 Timothy 3:6 and 7 for
[1:28:09] this sort are they which creep into
[1:28:11] houses and led captivity you know ever
[1:28:14] learning but never able to come to the
[1:28:15] knowledge of the truth
[1:28:18] right they don't have no godliness ever
[1:28:21] learning but never coming into the
[1:28:23] knowledge of the the truth ain't no
[1:28:26] godliness to all of those things L after
[1:28:28] silly go ahead to the
[1:28:31] next let's see 17
[1:28:34] 18 Paul a servant of Jesus Christ and
[1:28:37] apost servant of God and Apostle of
[1:28:39] Jesus Christ according to the faith of
[1:28:41] God's
[1:28:41] elect and the acknowledging of the
[1:28:45] [Music]
[1:28:46] truth which is after
[1:28:52] godliness now you reading that
[1:28:55] scripture read
[1:28:58] it Paul and the servant of God and
[1:29:00] Apostle of Jesus Christ according to the
[1:29:03] faith of God's
[1:29:06] elect and the
[1:29:09] acknowledging of the
[1:29:11] truth which is after
[1:29:14] godliness what should all of our truth
[1:29:16] be after
[1:29:19] godliness
[1:29:21] right last one we don't get on to that
[1:29:23] one
[1:29:27] he'll be desol what manner of person
[1:29:28] ought you to be okay we got something
[1:29:30] messed up on that when I I gave him the
[1:29:32] wrong
[1:29:36] quote cuz what I was wanting
[1:29:39] was
[1:29:41] yeah second Peter
[1:29:44] 3 11 is that it okay now we got it
[1:29:47] seeing then that all these things shall
[1:29:50] be dissolved what manner of person ought
[1:29:53] we to be
[1:29:54] in all holy
[1:29:56] conversation and
[1:29:59] godliness what kind of a person should
[1:30:01] we
[1:30:04] be
[1:30:06] godliness to be like
[1:30:08] God you know a child of
[1:30:11] God is God made manifest in another
[1:30:19] form yeah but see we're supposed that's
[1:30:22] what we are
[1:30:24] just remember we get him by
[1:30:28] measure Jesus had all of it you know
[1:30:31] what all that was in
[1:30:33] him if I got a measure it's the same
[1:30:37] thing that was in
[1:30:39] him the only thing you're going to do is
[1:30:41] degree
[1:30:43] it but remember a spoon full of water
[1:30:45] out of the
[1:30:46] ocean same chemical same thing is a
[1:30:50] whole ocean right amen so then go
[1:30:54] God living whether it be back there or
[1:30:57] living
[1:31:00] now
[1:31:01] godliness now we're going to go on to
[1:31:03] that because you come all this way
[1:31:05] before godliness is required then we'll
[1:31:07] get Matthew
[1:31:10] 5:48 to be you therefore perfect even as
[1:31:13] your father in Heaven is perfect but I'm
[1:31:14] not going that way I'm going to hold it
[1:31:16] off till Wednesday night Lord
[1:31:21] winning your gods
[1:31:24] that's
[1:31:27] right would it not
[1:31:30] be feasible or thoughtful enough to
[1:31:33] think about if you're God then you're
[1:31:34] supposed to act like him so wouldn't
[1:31:36] that be the definition of God in this to
[1:31:39] be like
[1:31:40] God what would he do in the case I said
[1:31:44] we used to see the kids with a band on
[1:31:46] what would Jesus do you
[1:31:49] know well why don't we take it to be
[1:31:52] that way if we claim to have his
[1:31:56] faith his
[1:31:58] virtue his
[1:32:00] knowledge his
[1:32:02] Temperance his
[1:32:07] patience and now all he wants us to do
[1:32:10] is just be like
[1:32:11] him but if you're understanding what I'm
[1:32:13] saying you can't be like him until you
[1:32:17] have those virtues that's right you're
[1:32:20] only a baby when you get to New Birth
[1:32:24] you're like him because you're a child
[1:32:26] of God but he's wanting growth
[1:32:30] development he's wanting that adoption
[1:32:32] to
[1:32:36] come and then I thought when adoption
[1:32:38] came
[1:32:39] that our name was just as good on a
[1:32:42] checkbook as
[1:32:46] his
[1:32:50] right I've always told you about
[1:32:52] adoption and I think people going went
[1:32:54] the wrong
[1:32:55] way what I've all heard I'm just putting
[1:32:57] what I've heard it's like that that
[1:33:01] you're coming on the scene and to be
[1:33:02] something great and this is lining up
[1:33:04] with what I'm talking about that you're
[1:33:06] God's but I take most people's adoption
[1:33:08] oral form as being that God is leaving
[1:33:12] and you're coming on the scene look at
[1:33:16] me
[1:33:18] no that is not adoption adoption is you
[1:33:22] going off the scene and God coming on
[1:33:25] the scene right now you tell me anything
[1:33:28] else about adoption well he just making
[1:33:30] it where you yeah he's making it where
[1:33:32] you and him but he's making it because
[1:33:33] he's in you adoption is God coming on
[1:33:36] the scene the
[1:33:38] tutor is to teach the
[1:33:41] nature of the father to the child until
[1:33:44] the child doesn't come the nature of the
[1:33:48] tutor right he becomes the nature of the
[1:33:51] father
[1:33:52] right so who's supposed to come on the
[1:33:55] scene God's supposed to come on the
[1:33:57] scene but where's he at he's in his
[1:34:03] people the new birth makes you God made
[1:34:08] manifest like a sister told us he used
[1:34:10] to play the piano fars years ago she
[1:34:12] said the way you're teaching it way
[1:34:13] brother mod is teaching it she said it
[1:34:15] don't make no difference how I live cuz
[1:34:17] I'm
[1:34:19] God I said you ain't getting
[1:34:21] it I said you need to go go back and
[1:34:24] listen a whole lot I said we ain't never
[1:34:26] talk nothing like
[1:34:28] that my teaching is God coming on the
[1:34:31] scene not leaving the scene and leaving
[1:34:33] it with
[1:34:34] me if his nature is in me then I'm to be
[1:34:37] like
[1:34:40] him and remember to be like him and like
[1:34:43] genesis let us make man in our own
[1:34:47] image come on musician in our own image
[1:34:50] he
[1:34:51] said with image
[1:34:54] is the very same
[1:34:56] person
[1:34:59] right we're not talking about another
[1:35:01] God coming on the scene we're talking
[1:35:03] about the same God but that's why we're
[1:35:05] not believing
[1:35:06] it we're not believing it the way that
[1:35:09] God is saying it we have our own
[1:35:12] interpretation to those thoughts and
[1:35:14] ideas instead of letting him say
[1:35:19] it I thought the Bible said that he was
[1:35:22] pleased to well
[1:35:27] amen wasn't that what it said about
[1:35:29] Jesus and whom I'm pleased to dwell
[1:35:32] brother brand saids please to dwell in
[1:35:34] you to honor your
[1:35:41] word

[1:35:48] are why don't we take it to be what we
[1:35:51] are what we got L's thing 604 in the
[1:35:53] spiral
[1:35:56] why not take it what God says about
