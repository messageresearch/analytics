[2:49] there's many many sicknesses and things
[2:51] that are among us we know that we're all
[2:53] getting older and all but that still
[2:55] doesn't mean we can't be healed because
[2:58] we believe you and we thank you as a
[3:01] prophet said we can't ask you maybe to
[3:03] turn back our age because that's part of
[3:06] life but we don't have to accept it
[3:09] either so we can walk in your loving
[3:11] grace and believe thank you for all of
[3:14] these things have your way as we read
[3:15] your word you come and speak to our
[3:17] hearts in Jesus name Colossians 3
[3:25] verse 9 lie not one to another seeing
[3:29] that you have put off the old man with
[3:31] his deeds all right now thee that order
[3:34] stop all the line that solves that
[3:36] that's what goes with him right and have
[3:39] put on the new man which is renewed and
[3:43] knowledge after the image of him that
[3:46] created him where there it is neither a
[3:50] Greek nor Jew or in him now circumcision
[3:55] nuns are uncircumcised barbarian
[3:57] Scythian bond or free but Christ is all
[4:00] and in all right now we'll go to
[4:05] Ephesians 4 verse 4 there is one body on
[4:11] spirit as we are all as ye are called in
[4:16] one hope of your calling one Lord one
[4:20] faith one baptism one God and Father of
[4:23] all who is above all and through all and
[4:27] in you all then you may be seated the
[4:29] Lord at his blessing to the reading of
[4:32] the word now we we've been on this
[4:34] thought for a few services of talking
[4:39] about the all-in-all and I want to kind
[4:43] of just run straight through it tonight
[4:47] and to make sure you follow what I'm
[4:50] talking about you know and then that way
[4:53] you know I had said we'd have questions
[4:57] and answers but we didn't get enough to
[5:00] cover a whole service but if we get to
[5:03] in time tonight we'll at this stage if
[5:05] you got any questions or whatever you
[5:07] know what we're talking about then we'll
[5:11] have questions if not maybe we'll have
[5:12] them Sunday or something so remember
[5:15] that now we have been talking about
[5:18] something that I don't believe this is
[5:21] understood by most people I'm just
[5:26] honest and I'm seeing it from the
[5:29] background of what I've heard and what
[5:31] has you know a little bit I have heard
[5:33] taught and I ain't saying ain't nobody
[5:35] got this we're only one God
[5:37] so you go ahead and think what you won't
[5:39] do that's your business but it ain't
[5:41] none of mine I don't know how to worry
[5:43] about what they're doing somewheres else
[5:44] I'm just trying to get you to see what
[5:47] I'm talking about
[5:48] alright now we talked about the word
[5:51] restoration alright and we say
[5:55] restoration means to restore all things
[5:57] in other words it means something that
[6:00] was previously in existence all right
[6:04] it's restored okay now and sometimes
[6:11] that restoration is a higher development
[6:18] I don't know the word to use correctly
[6:20] to say it but you know it may be in a
[6:24] higher form than originally what was
[6:27] there because it can be you know more
[6:31] coming forth more being said more being
[6:33] done more being revealed alright now we
[6:38] talk about the revealing and look of God
[6:41] okay and we say well now crisis the
[6:44] mystery of God revealed okay all right
[6:46] now then that mystery is hidden in the
[6:52] Word of God and to be revealed totally
[6:57] here in this last day now in doing that
[7:02] then we keep the mind thought of
[7:05] restoration no matter what we're talking
[7:07] about or we've been talking about that
[7:10] God came in three sons names all right
[7:15] son of man son of God son of David now
[7:21] that's the way your prophet we gave you
[7:23] enough I'll read a little bit in them
[7:24] you know to make sure the ones that
[7:26] hadn't heard it won't think it's some
[7:28] brother Dale idea no it's what the
[7:31] Prophet talked that there's three sons
[7:35] names all right now as I was saying
[7:38] Sunday trying to get the thought across
[7:41] remember that anything that would be
[7:45] revealed will be revealed in one of
[7:49] those
[7:51] stations amorphous changing his form
[7:57] revealing himself the way he's making
[7:59] himself manifest or will be involved in
[8:03] son of man son of God son of David
[8:06] alright and it will never end that that
[8:10] won't be done away but that doesn't
[8:12] reveal three gods
[8:13] you know that's three times God is
[8:17] manifesting or it's changing his form to
[8:21] reveal himself to mankind all right now
[8:26] see then a son of man that would be
[8:32] prophet okay now in the Old Testament
[8:37] it was dealing basically with son of man
[8:41] right the prophets son of man prophesy
[8:44] on a man is God revealing short Himself
[8:47] has to be the word you know to come
[8:51] forth all right now then one day that
[8:55] son of man himself walked up on earth in
[8:58] a body called Jesus Christ he was the
[9:03] son of man all right now then he spent
[9:06] all of his life declaring that and never
[9:09] did he openly declare himself to be the
[9:13] Son of God because he was not fulfilling
[9:17] that office all right or that time okay
[9:22] now keep that in your mind that whatever
[9:25] office you're dealing with you're
[9:27] dealing with a specific point and stay
[9:30] with that okay see throughout the Old
[9:33] Testament he could not be made known as
[9:35] son of God you have a couple of
[9:38] instances to work that you could bring
[9:40] forth the word son of God like the the
[9:42] three Hebrew children and one like under
[9:44] the son of God you know you can you
[9:46] ain't say it when I make a statement I
[9:48] wish you would listen I'm not making
[9:51] that there's nothing there but this I'm
[9:53] making the illustration our point that
[9:58] the manifestation is in in greater way
[10:01] of bringing for at that point
[10:04] alright Son of Man throughout the Old
[10:06] Testament
[10:07] alright then brother Brennan said he was
[10:10] birthed into human flesh being the son
[10:14] of man he constantly declared himself I
[10:18] the son of man son of man son of man
[10:20] who'd a man say you are the son of man
[10:22] am
[10:22] he was constantly speaking of son of man
[10:25] alright but then on the day of Pentecost
[10:28] when the Holy Ghost that that son of man
[10:30] released to where it could come back up
[10:32] on the church on the day of Pentecost he
[10:35] didn't come back a son of man time so
[10:39] God changes the dispensation hour
[10:41] changes is amore fiar changes his form
[10:44] from son of man to son of God alright
[10:50] the Prophet said now down to the ages
[10:53] then the church ages
[10:54] he was the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[10:56] which is son of God
[10:59] alright the spirit dwelling within each
[11:02] one of us and remember that the spirit
[11:05] the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God so
[11:08] now remember this don't ever forget that
[11:11] God isn't spirit I mean after all I'll
[11:14] try to teach so much to to bring him
[11:16] more into manifestation to where you can
[11:20] see him more with these spiritual eyes
[11:23] and and trying to make know never forget
[11:26] that he is that that God is the spirit
[11:32] all right
[11:33] now he made himself manifest are brought
[11:37] forth himself in the Old Testament and
[11:40] was showing that but he was showing it
[11:44] as son of man all right then has he come
[11:49] forth in human flesh then see that son
[11:51] of man was standing well where was the
[11:53] son of God inside the Son of Man the Son
[11:57] of man is more referencing to the flesh
[12:00] part are the the manifestation that you
[12:03] can see because you can't see a spirit
[12:07] now that's one thing that we were going
[12:10] to have to remember and I asked you over
[12:12] a couple of services about it I said
[12:15] when you get up to heaven or the future
[12:17] home
[12:18] what are you gonna see we'll see then
[12:23] if God is the spirit you can't see his
[12:26] spirit now come on we've been through
[12:29] that the prophets been through it you
[12:31] ought to know that the head goes this
[12:32] way you means okay you know see then
[12:36] spirit God our God in spirit form
[12:41] that's how do you what he is and he
[12:43] always will be good you'll never do away
[12:48] with spirit God it's the same it's the
[12:52] same God there on earth the Bible
[12:55] according to Scripture said in him dwell
[12:59] the fullness of the Godhead bodily all
[13:02] right what is the fullness of the
[13:03] Godhead by Father Son and Holy Ghost was
[13:05] dwelling in flash right the very soul
[13:09] the very spirit of Almighty God was
[13:13] dwelling in a body that had been spoken
[13:15] into existence by the word and he had
[13:18] become the word according to John 14 and
[13:21] dwelt among us all right now see then
[13:26] following that thought you you keep it
[13:28] lined up see he was the son of man all
[13:33] right when it comes into the church age
[13:35] is the son of God
[13:37] all right now then you got the Nexus son
[13:41] of David well I've asked that simple
[13:43] question to me it's to me it's always
[13:45] been that because I've always decided to
[13:48] look into things like that that how can
[13:51] you go from son of God in a dispensation
[13:54] of the Gentiles of the baptism of the
[13:57] Holy Ghost and then go to Israel as son
[14:03] of David that may not mean a thing to
[14:07] you and I wrote my own self a note you
[14:09] say I do not need to know under these
[14:12] things or don't need to understand them
[14:14] well you don't need to understand
[14:16] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[14:18] Christ I guess you don't need to
[14:24] understand there's just one true and
[14:25] living God hey let's go home
[14:30] we've wasted a lot of trouble to not
[14:33] people getting ready driving and coming
[14:35] here and I spent two weeks meditating on
[14:38] this thought to try to get it presented
[14:41] in the correct way
[14:43] if there's no God if there's not we
[14:45] might as well go home and forget it
[14:47] let's eat drink and be merry because
[14:48] tomorrow we die it's the brother Dale
[14:51] you're stealing no this exposing the
[14:54] carnality of all of us if we believe
[14:58] it's very important to understand God's
[15:02] Word now you explain restoration to me
[15:08] restoration means to restore what
[15:10] originally was all right now see then
[15:17] you got three sons named son of a man no
[15:21] no God son of David but then brother
[15:25] Branham when we'll read it I don't want
[15:27] to read to put it on here he says in
[15:30] between here he returns his son of man
[15:34] hey now we're right in the middle of
[15:37] restoration you never thought about the
[15:40] son of man had to be restored no we just
[15:46] talked about son of God being restored
[15:48] we talking about the word been destroyed
[15:49] well who in the world do you think I'm
[15:51] talking about the son of man is the word
[15:55] is the god of the word he's the very God
[15:58] himself being made manifest this in a
[16:01] different form or manifestation so then
[16:07] for a little while he comes back at son
[16:09] of man ended odd all of the world in
[16:15] their doings nobody picks it up here
[16:18] comes a little o prophet starts about
[16:21] 1949 this first one I could find
[16:25] saying son of man son of man son of man
[16:33] service either service son of man son of
[16:36] man showing that the god of that had
[16:43] Walt
[16:43] on the shores of Galilee the God that
[16:46] that had created all things was again
[16:50] walking on earth not brother branham now
[16:55] because brother Branham is not the Son
[16:57] of man I've said that in 1969 and I'm
[17:02] still holding on to it all right brother
[17:08] Branham as a son of man the son of man
[17:11] was living in Nice on a man ride
[17:13] very close I'll put it to what he said
[17:17] about us outside of the corporal body
[17:24] there walked in a man on this earth that
[17:27] we call William Branham that outside of
[17:34] the virgin birth and the things of the
[17:36] Lord Jesus it was so close until it's
[17:39] very amazing how he was being used until
[17:44] you can talk about the son of man and
[17:47] that's what I was saying it's in
[17:50] restoration you may have one to be
[17:53] restored
[17:54] you know seeing looking at but when it's
[17:57] made manifest it's a many members body
[18:00] has come from one point back here one
[18:04] was the son of man now coming in the end
[18:07] time to the son of man it comes to bride
[18:09] phone multiple many well-known I just
[18:16] don't see brother Dale I know it you
[18:18] don't see it because you ain't even
[18:19] paying that much attention in the
[18:20] listening you ain't listening to what
[18:22] I'm saying you're listening to what you
[18:24] want me to say you're not paying
[18:27] attention to what I'm trying to say see
[18:31] that son of man back there was promised
[18:33] to be restored we only deal with son of
[18:36] God being restored because that's more
[18:39] or less you know in hours through the
[18:41] ages and the things but why not the son
[18:44] of man being restored now you've got the
[18:48] key that we needed see to be able to
[18:50] balance out and give a correct
[18:52] understanding of how to move along in
[18:54] the gospel that then he
[18:57] go from son of man word made flesh in
[19:03] one human being come over as son of God
[19:09] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost down
[19:12] through the ages then come back in the
[19:15] end time returns the restorer back that
[19:21] son of man that a man will stand there
[19:25] and say more done in my services one not
[19:30] than what's done in the Bible recorded
[19:32] or something you know now that's amazing
[19:35] in it when it was restoration we talked
[19:40] about to some God a restoration we
[19:42] believe in that return the same son of
[19:46] god back he's on the defini Coast
[19:48] restoration all right see then you can
[19:55] go then from son of man son of God son
[20:00] of man son of David know that what
[20:04] brother Dale you got forward now no I
[20:05] ain't got form only region will read to
[20:08] you where the Prophet covers it but that
[20:11] don't stop it see if you're lost into
[20:14] that deal surely what I've been trying
[20:17] to bring out has blinded your eyes I'm
[20:20] serious
[20:21] open your eyes and listen if you can't
[20:24] understand the simplicity how are you
[20:26] going to keep up with a you can't do
[20:28] with the footmen how you gonna keep up
[20:30] with a horsemen gets here see because
[20:35] there's more to it then son of man son
[20:39] of God son of man son of David
[20:44] we got another step to be covered
[20:50] another manifestation another amor fee
[20:55] of Almighty God to make it in five
[20:59] minutes tations now I covered it come on
[21:04] don't don't lose me there's three sons
[21:08] name
[21:10] all right all these five has got to fall
[21:13] under three sons name it's not an
[21:16] addition all right just like brother
[21:20] Branham says see we talked about five
[21:22] three men at three sons night but a
[21:25] brother said he comes in four titles and
[21:30] he brings in son of man a son of Abraham
[21:34] royal grant see he's trying to get us to
[21:39] see the opening of the word that truly
[21:49] that God may be all and in all
[21:53] as I said son Danis it's a shame for you
[21:56] have to express it but when you read the
[21:59] Bible and say that God is all in all
[22:02] that does not mean that everybody in the
[22:06] world has got the new birth that does
[22:08] not mean everybody in the world is safe
[22:11] guess you could read it what I read it
[22:13] to you all and in all
[22:18] so that means he's in everybody like
[22:21] I've told you brother here one time
[22:23] tried to give the Holy Ghost to the
[22:24] cabbage but I didn't agree with it the
[22:29] reason I didn't agree with it it's
[22:30] because I didn't agree with the fact
[22:32] that everybody be safe if you're gonna
[22:35] save with cabbage surely you can save
[22:36] everybody else you say silly that's
[22:40] right
[22:42] but now look what I'm talking about
[22:44] then we'll read it John a man throughout
[22:50] the Old Testament the Ministry of Jesus
[22:52] Christ son of God come on there
[22:56] Pentecost we had a fall in a way of that
[22:59] had to have restorations right but we
[23:02] don't look back at son of man being
[23:04] restored would you look at son of God
[23:07] and remember son of man the Word made
[23:11] flesh son of God the Holy Spirit in
[23:16] mankind God living on in his bride comes
[23:20] back in the son of man
[23:24] through one man yes that then goes out
[23:29] because it was not meant to be left in
[23:32] one man he said how do you know that
[23:35] because if it was only meant to be in
[23:37] one land that had been only one person
[23:39] received the baptism when all the ghosts
[23:41] from their Pentagon so come on get your
[23:44] mind straight did you catch that point
[23:46] if it's just to stay in one man then go
[23:51] back to one man give one man the Holy
[23:54] Ghost under there Pentecost the rest of
[23:55] us are lost so now you know that ain't
[23:58] right
[23:59] okay you see there we hope son of man
[24:04] son of God son of man son of David now
[24:17] remember son of David will be Jesus
[24:21] Christ sitting on the throne of David in
[24:25] the Millennium what's gonna be in the
[24:32] future home
[24:38] that's all I'm asking you son of David
[24:43] is to the millennial reign which is
[24:46] still in time I ask you to read or
[24:50] listen to the tape the future home I'm
[24:54] not going to ask you how many of you did
[24:55] cuz I'm gonna say it most of you didn't
[24:59] I'd only I heard that the other day
[25:02] well you might ought to go listen to it
[25:07] you know brother branham could pick up
[25:09] an eighth day and put it together all
[25:14] the way through the word and come out to
[25:15] the end of it with a number eight
[25:19] mankind was as far as they went was the
[25:22] number seven you know that but there are
[25:26] seven listen the seventh organization is
[25:29] night was the baptism of the holy ghost
[25:31] in arrest right they told it is arrest a
[25:37] new birth is arrest well that's true but
[25:42] the eight goes into the eternity what is
[25:46] he gonna be in eternity what are you
[25:51] expecting to see expected lecture
[25:58] denomination here's the father sitting
[26:00] over here he's got a long beard he's old
[26:02] man here's the son over here
[26:04] he's young looking he's you know and
[26:07] over here is the Holy Ghost fluttering
[26:08] like a dove and you got the Great
[26:11] Trinity
[26:19] from my understanding of the Bible
[26:23] brother Herman Garland I like his leaves
[26:26] and he said I know that's in there cuz I
[26:29] just read it that was just kind of a
[26:32] statement it's worth I know it's in
[26:34] there I just ready well you know
[26:36] according to what I understand the Bible
[26:39] Jesus said I and my father are one and
[26:44] according to that he said if you've seen
[26:45] me you've seen the father
[26:49] well then what if the father look like
[26:52] the son what does a son look like the
[26:54] father okay that's why I said what are
[27:00] you going what are you expecting to see
[27:02] when you get over there on our old man
[27:07] some kind of dove some kind of form hmm
[27:14] I'm expecting to see Jesus cuz he said
[27:19] if you've seen me you've seen the father
[27:27] well you can't see the father that
[27:30] spirit right we'll get to the back to
[27:34] that in a minute but I want to make sure
[27:37] you follow the line up to a spot then
[27:40] we'll continue the thought and go into
[27:43] the future home but I want you to think
[27:46] about it alright then he comes in three
[27:53] sons named son of man son of God son of
[27:57] David this is taking off with God's
[27:59] provided place of worship please I
[28:01] forgot how many times he makes this one
[28:03] statement I just picked this one because
[28:05] uh well as Ricardo read it again the
[28:07] other day you know here now remember
[28:10] they don't have this one they have the
[28:12] they can go ahead and pull up number one
[28:15] go ahead and pull up number one cuz this
[28:17] is a top part right above it remember
[28:20] and the day of the Son of Man will be
[28:24] revealed now remember the son not the
[28:27] son of God he came in three sons named
[28:30] son of man son of God son of David
[28:32] when he was on earth he come as son of
[28:35] man he was a prophet son of man is a
[28:39] prophet Jeremiah self prophets problem
[28:42] on according to the scripture a son of
[28:44] man all right but after his death burial
[28:49] and resurrection now he has been the son
[28:52] of God the supernatural the holy spirit
[28:55] all right did you get number one sorry
[29:01] this is continuation what I just reading
[29:05] but he promised before the coming of the
[29:07] end time the world would get like it was
[29:10] in Sodom when a man came down in human
[29:12] form three of them two angels coming all
[29:15] the way down to where we're doing what's
[29:16] now Jesus himself at that the day when
[29:19] the Son of Man is being revealed in
[29:22] other words the Son of Man the Ministry
[29:25] of Jesus Christ himself brother Branham
[29:30] had the Ministry of Jesus Christ I'll go
[29:33] with our 100% because that's the only
[29:36] thing he couldn't wait could have been
[29:37] that don't make him God but it's the
[29:42] ministry once the church will come
[29:46] through justification through Luther
[29:48] through sanctification through Wesley
[29:50] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[29:52] are the Pentecostals knowing and go
[29:55] right on into the perfection of the Son
[29:58] of Man
[30:04] so now he's got it son of man son of God
[30:07] son of man now we can go to son of David
[30:13] look what he says go right on into the
[30:17] perfection of the Son of Man that when
[30:19] the husband and wife will be the same
[30:21] self persons read that God will be so
[30:27] manifested into his bride his church
[30:29] till they will both be the same they are
[30:33] one now do you see where we're at
[30:35] alright so what is it to do
[30:42] number two the unveiling of God he came
[30:47] first as a prophet they crucified him
[30:50] his own crucified he came as a son of
[30:52] man then after the Holy Spirit came he
[30:55] was then the son of God God is the
[30:57] spirit he was the holy spirit from God
[30:59] he lived through the church ages the Son
[31:01] of God and now in the Millennium he be
[31:04] the son of David sitting upon the throne
[31:05] of his father David he is the son of
[31:08] David now because that's revealing to
[31:10] you and I we see him already of what
[31:12] he's going to do right look and remember
[31:15] between the son of God not between the
[31:18] son of God where would that be between
[31:21] the son of God and the dispensation or
[31:24] the point you're going to what
[31:25] and remember between the son of God in
[31:28] the lady of sea in church age they put
[31:30] him out who did who did it put out they
[31:35] won't the son of God they won't signs
[31:39] and wonders they won't healings and
[31:41] deliverances and things but they put out
[31:44] the word through the Prophet right come
[31:50] on when the son of man stood here in a
[31:54] human vessel and that don't make him the
[31:58] son of man they say son of man but when
[32:03] he did he stood here and spoke out they
[32:05] put him out they put this message out
[32:10] they don't want this man ain't thought
[32:12] of nobody
[32:13] you think the churches want to get rid
[32:15] of the Holy Ghost come on don't get the
[32:17] wrong idea they won't the Holy Ghost
[32:19] they want the signs and the wonders and
[32:21] the healings and deliverances and
[32:23] salvation which they don't want nothing
[32:25] to do with Son of Man one reason they
[32:29] don't understand it and remember between
[32:32] the Son of God and the latest in church
[32:34] had you put him out and in Luke he said
[32:36] he would be revealed again it's on Son
[32:38] of Man the Prophet fulfilling the rest
[32:41] of it see the Scriptures taught
[32:42] perfectly together son of man son of God
[32:45] son of David what was it it's the same
[32:48] God all the time just changing his form
[32:51] in more feet he just changed it it's a
[32:54] great drama to him
[32:57] is acting yeah all right no listen II
[33:08] what paragraph will be all I'm 72 going
[33:11] down to 73 for for his acts he changes
[33:18] his form then he came the son of form of
[33:22] the son of man for the Reformers aged
[33:25] Wesley Luther he didn't come from a man
[33:27] in Lutheran Westland him right come on
[33:29] what's he saying he came in the form of
[33:31] the son of man to give his life in it
[33:33] now for the Reformers age
[33:35] Wesley Luke and all down through we find
[33:37] out that they got it so bundled up just
[33:40] like the is life still do it does not
[33:42] appear he does appear in the last days
[33:44] in the Pentecostal age as the Holy
[33:46] Spirit they rejected they did the same
[33:50] thing Israel and what does he do now
[33:53] return that son of man in the church
[33:59] ages now return to some of them and then
[34:02] from that son of David see how close we
[34:05] are son of man son of David son of God
[34:07] he's revealed in the last days the son
[34:09] of man according to Malachi 4 and the
[34:12] rest of the prophets pertain and they
[34:14] put him outside he's knocking at the
[34:16] door so he comes back as what sort of
[34:22] man at the end of the last age come back
[34:27] his son of man ok restoration not a man
[34:35] restoration ok
[34:41] go ahead in number three cause this is
[34:45] one I like it's taken four crosses the
[34:50] mystery of God revealed they may not
[34:53] have it cuz I change these around so
[34:56] much paragraph 448 we got it they notice
[35:01] God making himself known
[35:02] now we're not supposed to make converts
[35:05] to Christianity by government but by the
[35:06] revelation the Christ in you as God was
[35:09] in Christ as God was in Christ Christ is
[35:12] in you when what God did in Christ
[35:16] Christ does in you what signs did God in
[35:19] Christ Christ does in you
[35:20] isn't that beautiful oh I like it Jesus
[35:24] said at that day for therefore - John
[35:27] 1420 lat
[35:30] this day when this revelation is made
[35:36] known what revelation crisis the mystery
[35:40] of God revealed right you will know that
[35:47] I am in the father and the father in me
[35:51] that's like I said Sunday and I said it
[35:53] over and over that's easy to understand
[35:56] the father was in him the father gave
[35:59] His life and let his life be transmitted
[36:01] that life can be transmitted into you a
[36:06] simple we're look at what the revelation
[36:10] is you will know that I am in the father
[36:13] and the father in me I in you and you
[36:17] and me now explain that I in you as the
[36:22] Holy Ghost coming and living in you
[36:23] right the new birth
[36:26] what is it when it's saying and you and
[36:30] me it's a greater revelation and what we
[36:37] think we think crisis the mystery of God
[36:39] revealed we understand that that just
[36:41] puts Christ in you letter ends wonders
[36:47] in
[36:49] that day you'll know that I am in the
[36:52] father and I knew but what its gonna be
[36:57] when it's you and me
[37:04] how can a mortal be and be a part of God
[37:11] come on we'll get to it man at that day
[37:16] you shall know that I and the father are
[37:17] one I am in the father and the father is
[37:20] in me
[37:21] then when the revelation comes forth
[37:23] then it's I in you and you and me there
[37:29] you are
[37:29] the manifold freefall manner I in you
[37:35] the Holy Ghost coming and living in you
[37:38] but you in me you mean we were in God
[37:49] now that's what the scripture says but
[37:53] yet you're gonna blot yourself out and
[37:55] say I don't believe it
[37:56] and then I'm just too deep and too
[37:59] intellectual I can't understand brother
[38:01] Dale I didn't say it tell me you don't
[38:11] understand the Prophet don't tell me you
[38:13] don't understand me I didn't say it the
[38:19] Prophet is one that said it right
[38:25] now are you with me them God has to be
[38:34] made manifest for changes form you go
[38:38] son of man son God son of man son David
[38:46] now you got four manifestations not for
[38:50] God's you got four times that he's
[38:55] changing dispensations come only one
[39:01] from dispensation Old Testament the New
[39:02] Testament come only when the
[39:03] dispensation the baptism when Holy Ghost
[39:05] coming to the Son of man that's what we
[39:07] just been reading then from the Son of
[39:09] Man he goes to son of David then when he
[39:11] goes to the son of David to the Future
[39:12] home what is he what about him how's he
[39:23] gonna reveal itself then we read the
[39:30] scripture from Galatians and from
[39:36] Ephesians and come in collations
[39:41] colossians colossians 3 said that God
[39:47] may be all and in all something's got to
[39:56] happen something's got to take place
[40:04] what transpires what's gonna happen I
[40:13] kept on that over and over and over it
[40:16] you know how are we gonna be able to go
[40:18] from son of God to son of David you know
[40:21] just wore out on that and you just dried
[40:24] up and said what in the world you're
[40:26] talking about well if I preach father
[40:30] and son Holy Ghost baptism you get on
[40:32] the same time you just drive up well see
[40:37] if one's not important or that's not
[40:38] important to me every word of God is
[40:42] important there's no such thing as
[40:46] something that not being important and
[40:50] there's no such thing as something that
[40:52] said they takes things in the Bible that
[40:54] we'll never be able to be made manifest
[40:56] I don't agree with that your prophets
[40:58] that ever word had to be made benefit I
[41:00] believed him I don't care who else now
[41:02] he said every word has to be made
[41:04] manifest mm-hmm but now listen what's it
[41:11] gonna be like in heaven then we went
[41:19] through the point of what his plan it's
[41:21] not a man son of God son of man son of
[41:24] David we're still in time we're hooked
[41:30] in the Millennium that's the seventh day
[41:34] that's the day that comes back because
[41:36] man fell in the seventh day he didn't
[41:39] fall in the sixth day he created this is
[41:42] he fell on the seventh day as God rested
[41:50] why do you have a millennium the Prophet
[41:54] said to prove the sin curse was gone you
[41:59] were going to house somebody live a
[42:01] thousand years it ain't gonna matter to
[42:03] me and you
[42:04] we're gonna be there on a honeymoon as
[42:06] the eternal as forever will ever be
[42:08] eternal will be that in the Millennium
[42:12] right with somebody he's gonna live a
[42:17] thousand years because he you're still
[42:21] in time
[42:25] by the new birth you have the eighth day
[42:27] in your soul by the new birth which is
[42:30] eternal life but you're still living in
[42:33] a seven in the Millennium so now what
[42:36] are you gonna do what's gonna change us
[42:39] from time to eternity they come on I
[42:49] just said we're eternal when we get dark
[42:52] oh we've got the store and we know what
[42:54] it is we've got the mystery we
[42:56] understand the crisis of ministry we
[42:58] understand why brother Branham would say
[43:00] he said if you get to know seals and
[43:03] don't understand
[43:04] listen to him it's in Chrysler mystery
[43:06] he said come back to this message to
[43:10] understand the seals we go to Chrysler
[43:12] mystery that's what he said you know
[43:18] then the Chrysler mystery let her run
[43:20] and push you in the millennium and puts
[43:22] David on the throne read christ the
[43:25] mystery and you'll see it
[43:29] he puts David on the throne in the
[43:33] Millennium because that's where he's
[43:35] supposed to be that's the promise to
[43:37] David his son Solomon was the natural
[43:41] the Lord Jesus is the spiritual okay
[43:48] what you're hooked in time no wonder
[43:57] brother branham could say and it was
[43:58] told they'd better run the master do you
[44:01] understand what I saw yeah he said I
[44:05] asked you do you understand
[44:06] he said no daddy he said I could count
[44:15] on the hands dealing that understood
[44:17] now that's according to don't quote me
[44:23] as the authority he's playing common
[44:27] sense and you're in the Millennium
[44:30] you're still hooked in time now that's
[44:33] hard to think at little pea-brain
[44:36] brain we've got can't comprehend right
[44:41] well we gonna be there is eternal right
[44:44] because we're already got it here we
[44:46] already have the eighth day of the
[44:48] baptism of the Holy Ghost in our soul
[44:50] what we need is the redemption of the
[44:52] body that comes under the son of man
[45:01] come home sure I know you don't like me
[45:07] but what does the son of man mean to you
[45:12] you know that we Baptist taught the Son
[45:15] of man was resurrection sign
[45:26] it's not a man's sign of the
[45:27] resurrection well I don't care what the
[45:31] Baptist out after will see what I'm
[45:33] getting you just the point I'm trying to
[45:34] get you to see is that brother Branham
[45:37] when he was standing here had the
[45:39] resurrection sign that was the sign of
[45:43] the Son of Man no wonder he can say
[45:48] bring me 24 I believe it was with it of
[45:51] your worst cases I'll guarantee your
[45:53] healing for every one of them right
[45:59] because he had a resurrection sign
[46:06] that's the sign of the son of Mike come
[46:10] on but what about this future home what
[46:20] about this time that you'll go into
[46:23] eternity how are we gonna get from the
[46:29] Millennium to the future home and what's
[46:38] it going to be like remember whatever it
[46:46] is has got to be related to three sons
[46:50] name whatever is in the future home
[46:53] whatever is in eternity as we call it
[46:56] heaven or whatever you want to call it
[46:58] just remember it starts here your
[47:04] eternal life the Prophet says be getting
[47:06] right here to alter we've done had to
[47:12] sign I mean the Lord Jesus has already
[47:14] went through all of those things taking
[47:16] to everything going to the change of the
[47:18] body in walking home the prophets
[47:23] already brought us the message to change
[47:26] these bodies that is the son of man do
[47:34] you not mmm oh
[47:37] how close
[47:40] no wonder the people this message they
[47:43] looked at and I couldn't help it I'd say
[47:49] every one of us in this building to be
[47:50] the same way if we just said with him
[47:52] day in and day out and he said to our
[47:55] encode you have anythi she's gonna catch
[47:56] him any deer he is gonna kill where
[47:59] there's that and what to do it'd be hard
[48:04] to sit there without thinking there's
[48:09] something different about this man
[48:11] right but the main thing about that man
[48:15] was the word not the signs and the
[48:18] wonders but the word signs and wonders
[48:21] was only the bait to catch us put on the
[48:24] hook to catch us it's the word now
[48:31] what's it gonna be like and how can we
[48:35] get there okay let's see what brother
[48:40] Branham had to say about this little
[48:44] point from he covers it in Christ some
[48:46] history then he goes in the future on
[48:48] number four and got it that day the
[48:55] kingdom be given over to the father he
[48:58] might be oh you know the kingdoms got to
[49:06] be given over to the Father
[49:07] now we're gonna read the scripture that
[49:09] we've been reading before only out of
[49:11] Corinthians but just look at what he's
[49:15] saying what Kingdom he that sits with me
[49:21] in my throne
[49:22] what was it as I did overcome sit with
[49:26] my father and his strong sons throne is
[49:33] the millennial reign finality no I said
[49:39] finality don't hold me to the rest of it
[49:41] finality the sun's reign will be in the
[49:44] Millennium sitting on the throne of
[49:45] David
[49:47] we'll be sitting on that wrong
[49:58] will it be just Jesus sitting there who
[50:02] will be there now Luke can read and that
[50:08] that day the kingdom be given over to
[50:12] the father he might be all in all
[50:15] while he's yet speaking out here David
[50:17] crying that's millennium so he ties
[50:20] future home Christ some history ties
[50:22] millennium in the future home into one
[50:25] bundle cause listen to it because that's
[50:27] the millennium David sitting on the
[50:30] throne the king over the whole human
[50:33] race and the water yet speaking I don't
[50:35] know what they're thinking about
[50:36] will they speak I'll answer the wolf and
[50:40] the lamb shall feed together millennium
[50:47] knows what I'm talking about he's gonna
[50:50] have to start in the Millennium to
[50:53] finish in the future home what I've
[50:57] tried to get you to see go ahead to the
[51:01] next time go to the future home and
[51:03] watch TV with his throne in the Trop
[51:08] revelation 21:23
[51:10] they know life for the lamb landlord is
[51:12] the light there oh the Lord God is the
[51:15] pillar fire that followed the children
[51:17] of Israel through the wilderness and he
[51:19] is ascended up on the throne in that
[51:24] perfect kingdoms one time the kingdom
[51:28] that Jesus is to surrender to the father
[51:38] that God might be all and in all
[51:43] if it don't climax with him being all
[51:47] and in all Jesus's kingdom which wrought
[51:50] on earth because it would stop in time
[51:56] hey come on folks it's time to wake up
[52:01] Jesus sets upon his throne here is our
[52:04] Joseph and the king is that light that
[52:07] will be on top of the mountain in his
[52:09] holy light will flood the entire
[52:12] the kingdom that Jesus is to surrender
[52:15] worth that ad in the scripture I'm glad
[52:21] you asked that
[52:22] go to number seven brothers we'll get
[52:25] back to six but I want number seven and
[52:29] we read this over and over
[52:32] first Corinthians 15:22 23 whereas in
[52:37] Adam all die even so in Christ shall all
[52:40] be made alive but every man in his own
[52:42] order Christ the firstfruits afterward
[52:45] they that are Christ's at his coming
[52:48] knit all together then cometh the end
[52:51] when he shall have delivered up the
[52:54] kingdom to God who did what the kingdom
[53:00] that he has delivered delivered up the
[53:05] kingdom to God even the father when he
[53:09] shall have put down all rule and all
[53:11] authority and power listen he who Jesus
[53:18] for he must reign till he hath put all
[53:22] enemies under his feet the last enemy

[54:26] but they ain't you ain't gonna do it
[54:27] anyway so forget it study the prophets
[54:29] message and see if that's what he say it
[54:32] go get him I'll give you the page where
[54:35] he done I wrote it down where he said
[54:37] this happened this happened this
[54:38] happened this out this happens this
[54:40] happened all right what am I gonna do
[54:42] preach it gotta get this in line with
[54:44] this and the line with this and the line
[54:45] with is wrong over there all right right
[54:50] well what does that matter most of you
[54:54] don't even know maher mageddon is on
[54:56] this side of the millennium there's a
[54:58] thousand years then you got gog and
[54:59] magog Goggin armageddon is more of a
[55:03] nuclear style of destructive they will
[55:05] not blow everything to pieces but Gog
[55:09] and Magog burns ever sinned even sin and
[55:13] even the sinner even the devil and all
[55:16] of that is destroyed in the lake of fire
[55:18] that's gog and magog till the last enemy
[55:27] to be destroyed spiritual death is
[55:31] destroyed by the new birth the physical
[55:35] death was still dying so until that
[55:38] happens until we stop dying once we have
[55:46] to put all things under his feet but
[55:49] when he said all things are put under
[55:51] him it is manifest that he is excepted
[55:55] which did put all things under him
[56:02] that's not a CCE PT he takes accepted
[56:06] that's accepted exe EPT edy I told you
[56:13] go home look it up in the dictionary
[56:14] you don't have a PI's tense of the word
[56:17] except you have accept and you have
[56:19] exception they don't give you the PI's
[56:24] tense and then go into your Strong's and
[56:29] see what it gives you you realize what
[56:31] it's saying come on church
[56:36] okay who guard him sale has put all
[56:42] things under his feet
[56:43] whose feet Jesus's feet you're trying to
[56:47] turn heaven help you look well when he
[56:52] says all things are put under him it is
[56:57] manifest made known or shown that he is
[57:02] accepted not accepted accepted zero and
[57:14] realize what that simply saying when it
[57:18] is manifest this one you're talking
[57:19] about his manifest that he is the all
[57:23] and all not that he's accepted for being
[57:26] that but he is the one who has accepted
[57:30] your name did the Prophet said that it's
[57:38] now that you accepted him he said it's
[57:43] whether or not he's accepted you now
[57:46] we're right back to you in God and God
[57:51] in you if you can get to the God being
[57:57] in you and find out how you and God are
[57:59] one now you're getting to the capability
[58:04] of understanding while that word is put
[58:06] though it's put our to show you not that
[58:10] he's accepted for doing it he is the one
[58:12] who has accepted you come on church
[58:20] which did put all things under him now
[58:23] lift the scripture and when all things
[58:25] shall be subdued unto Him that's when
[58:31] all of this has finished the life the
[58:33] enemy all of these things and when all
[58:38] things shall be subdued unto him then
[58:41] shall the son also himself be subject
[58:46] unto him that put all things under
[58:50] him that God may be all in all read it
[58:59] the son himself shall be be subject are
[59:04] you shall be subject subject unto him
[59:08] that put all kinds is the sonship gonna
[59:11] terminate natural reading that's what
[59:17] it's saying son chef ain't gonna
[59:20] terminate but the son ship will become
[59:26] subject okay
[59:31] what about it go back to number six now
[59:36] there you go they're getting faced on
[59:39] this thing on top of Mount Zion will set
[59:42] the lamb and the city only no neither
[59:44] the land above the lamb will be the
[59:46] father
[59:47] listen sounds just like it said
[59:51] something's up here and ones down here
[59:53] and this is going that away and that's
[59:55] it going that away like this that old
[59:59] Catholic priests this is the way it is
[1:00:02] okay
[1:00:05] look no need no light for the lamb is a
[1:00:09] lot their oven above the lamb will be
[1:00:11] the father which is the low gosh God the
[1:00:14] great light the eternal light that's
[1:00:16] that'll shine just above the throne and
[1:00:20] Jesus will not be on his Father's throne
[1:00:27] he'll be on his throne the life form
[1:00:33] before the future home
[1:00:36] he's son of David come on he'll be on
[1:00:48] his throne now listen listen to your
[1:00:51] prophet and the father will hover over
[1:00:54] the son which the father and son will be
[1:01:01] one and while they're yet speaking I'll
[1:01:04] answer before they think I'm thinking
[1:01:06] farther in my life that that's right
[1:01:08] and Jesus will commit a perfect perfect
[1:01:12] age to the the perfect Living God that
[1:01:16] he has redeemed and give over to the
[1:01:20] father is that right we'll turn to God
[1:01:24] the Father which is spirit not a man
[1:01:26] spirit all nature of goodness and
[1:01:29] getting everything together us in the
[1:01:30] end good anything is perverted to form
[1:01:33] is Satan what's he gonna do the father
[1:01:37] will hover over the Sun the Sun setting
[1:01:43] on the throne of David that's where he
[1:01:48] said that's his last appearance before
[1:01:51] the future home his son of David son of
[1:02:00] David is the his Jesus's kingdom
[1:02:04] remember they asked one set on this side
[1:02:06] one on that night Kingdom he said I'm
[1:02:08] not ralphie to do it I can't give all
[1:02:10] that
[1:02:16] you realize have you listened see then
[1:02:21] there's five times see he changed sort
[1:02:26] of man changed his phone the son of day
[1:02:30] is I mean son of God
[1:02:32] James is formed from son of God
[1:02:35] back to son of man to bring the Pais all
[1:02:39] of these things then he goes a son of
[1:02:42] David there's one more change in that
[1:02:48] future home according to what your
[1:02:50] prophet is saying Jesus will be sitting
[1:02:57] on a throne and the father will hover on
[1:03:04] hover over a little over him that God
[1:03:08] may be all in all very simple now you
[1:03:16] can see what he's gonna be you say
[1:03:18] what's he gonna be like I told you the
[1:03:22] other day we can thank see we're human
[1:03:24] beings and these people right over here
[1:03:25] these denominator think we're crazy well
[1:03:27] okay let me go ahead what you see
[1:03:30] brother branham didn't say the 33 of
[1:03:32] Hoffman's head of Christ was exactly
[1:03:35] like the Lord Jesus when he said the
[1:03:36] closest he'd ever seen
[1:03:37] so what's God look like no no wait a
[1:03:42] minute that's Jesus well jesus said if
[1:03:47] you've seen me you've seen the father if
[1:03:51] the father gonna look like an old man
[1:03:53] with long hair no beard while walking
[1:03:55] with a croc instead it's gonna be about
[1:04:00] 19 over here then there'll be a flutter
[1:04:03] of a dive-off over here and we got it
[1:04:05] all beautiful in the Bible hog wash his
[1:04:11] brother done so you say it's a good
[1:04:13] point
[1:04:14] hogwash I haven't read what I believe
[1:04:20] I've read what he said
[1:04:24] someday the son himself is gonna become
[1:04:28] subject not that it's going to vanish
[1:04:31] and do away no that's where you're wrong
[1:04:34] you ain't listening you cannot see
[1:04:39] spirit God are you women now now come on
[1:04:44] hello you want to say did brother
[1:04:46] Branham say there's a spirit within me
[1:04:48] but he said you can't see it is that
[1:04:53] right that you can't see me
[1:04:56] he said code I'm a spirit remember in
[1:05:03] the beginning it was God's plan to
[1:05:05] reveal himself so he had to change
[1:05:07] yourself into more of a form tangibility
[1:05:10] x' or something to the word the logos
[1:05:13] the theophany then he began to create
[1:05:15] the world that was that spirit God that
[1:05:20] was that Bible John 14 120 something
[1:05:23] where he says God is a spirit and they
[1:05:27] that worship Him must worship Him in
[1:05:30] spirit and in truth though when we get
[1:05:35] there that'll be the five times that he
[1:05:38] changes his form or the fifth time it
[1:05:40] won't change the more it's the kingdom
[1:05:44] that the son himself I told you 20 years
[1:05:49] ago I said one of these days I'll preach
[1:05:52] to you one card from Genesis all the way
[1:05:58] from Genesis that same God it just keeps
[1:06:02] changing its form
[1:06:03] he just keeps making himself known in
[1:06:07] another form another form another form
[1:06:09] if we don't keep that lined up we're
[1:06:12] just this Trinitarian there's anybody
[1:06:13] else was Jesus lying when he said I and
[1:06:19] my father one you've seen me you've seen
[1:06:22] the father I come in my father's name
[1:06:28] see that what's the trouble they killed
[1:06:31] him because he was claiming he was God
[1:06:36] he wasn't claiming this s to be just the
[1:06:38] Son of God he was cleaning said to be
[1:06:40] the son of man and Israel was to be
[1:06:43] expecting prophets prophets prophets
[1:06:45] because they went on that son of man
[1:06:50] remember who was it John which one ass
[1:06:52] and said well you're their senator or
[1:06:54] you won the prophets see they look for
[1:06:56] them prophets I mean life's word see all
[1:07:04] of this when it keeps unfailing it will
[1:07:08] finally unveil to the finality that in
[1:07:12] the future home not the son is a second
[1:07:18] person or a third person or whatever but
[1:07:21] the son of man himself the Lord Jesus
[1:07:25] Christ that has been made eternal by
[1:07:29] resurrection and everything a change
[1:07:34] you'll be there but the father will show
[1:07:38] that he's accepted EXE EP not he is
[1:07:43] accepted ACC EPT not that he doesn't
[1:07:48] just accept Jesus he becomes Jesus made
[1:07:57] manifest
[1:08:04] because you can't see spirit so he's
[1:08:07] gonna have to always have a phone then
[1:08:12] one second that God may be all and in
[1:08:18] all
[1:08:18] I asked the question another day at the
[1:08:24] end can you understand not to sonship
[1:08:29] terminates like being done away with but
[1:08:31] son becomes totally subjected until
[1:08:34] everything is in subjection and he the
[1:08:38] spirit God himself just hovers over that
[1:08:41] flesh well now let me ask you a question
[1:08:47] what about the all and all brother
[1:08:52] Branham said God is not complete without
[1:08:56] you right do you need for me to pull it
[1:08:58] up they've got it
[1:09:00] God is not complete without you come on
[1:09:06] you mean God's not complete without you
[1:09:10] you're looking at the wrong thing
[1:09:12] he didn't need this anyway this garbage
[1:09:17] can to him but when he's in you he has
[1:09:24] accepted you as being his children that
[1:09:31] all in all he's in he's in here and he's
[1:09:37] in all he's in his fullness sitting
[1:09:40] there and brother around him said it
[1:09:42] I'll get back to these later in him
[1:09:45] throughout the fullness of the Godhead
[1:09:47] bodily
[1:09:47] he said no leaven among the bride brings
[1:09:50] the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[1:09:59] you see Church what I saw in 1769 and
[1:10:03] preached it to bride of Jesus Christ
[1:10:06] would be the son of Leah now you tell me
[1:10:17] you're not the word my flesh well then
[1:10:18] what are you
[1:10:19] I mean what do you expect you to be what
[1:10:22] are you thinking going to take place I'm
[1:10:24] thinking that when we get dire we're
[1:10:26] going to gather around the throne and
[1:10:27] when the father hovers over the Sun
[1:10:30] it'll over over over ever Sun because
[1:10:35] we're his offspring oh do we need to go
[1:10:41] in and on it once
[1:10:45] do we need to discuss anointed ones and
[1:10:52] his Spirit II and you makes you an
[1:10:53] anointed one makes you a little Christ
[1:10:56] what about the remember my point if you
[1:11:03] don't go into the future home and pick
[1:11:05] that eighth day that prophet taught in
[1:11:07] the future home if you don't pick it up
[1:11:09] correctly you're gonna remain under
[1:11:10] seven and you're gonna keep on going
[1:11:12] we're going to all die and go by the
[1:11:13] flesh by the way of the grave and so
[1:11:16] will everybody from now on
[1:11:25] we've got to make a step from there the
[1:11:28] point of son of David and understanding
[1:11:30] we're not dire and understanding when we
[1:11:32] get to the Millennium now listen if you
[1:11:35] think this ain't right when we get to
[1:11:37] the Millennium you did at least bumps
[1:11:39] your head or grinned a little bit while
[1:11:41] ago when we get to the Millennium you
[1:11:44] know we can sit on the throne with him
[1:11:47] right is that scripture do we sit on the
[1:11:51] throne way I mean he promised us that in
[1:11:52] his game time we said on a kingdom I
[1:11:56] thought brother Branham told Daniel that
[1:12:02] the bride would be the anointing to the
[1:12:05] temple in the Millennium now the bride
[1:12:12] ain't anointing to the temple in the
[1:12:14] future home cause ain't gonna be no
[1:12:17] temple in the future home the lamb is
[1:12:22] the temple you say what do you need a
[1:12:27] temple in the Millennium brother branham
[1:12:30] said there'll be things in the
[1:12:31] Millennium that won't be in the future
[1:12:34] in the Millennium you're gonna have a
[1:12:36] temple to explain all of these things
[1:12:41] but you don't need it you don't need a
[1:12:44] sacrifice altar that's not in the
[1:12:47] Millennium in the future home you won't
[1:12:49] even have a temple you won't even have a
[1:12:52] lot burb they life at us they've lasted
[1:12:57] us for years
[1:12:58] me and Lisa we made the most horrible
[1:13:02] sin that could ever be found out they
[1:13:06] called her up and it was a police
[1:13:08] department or something win it anyhow
[1:13:11] they wanted her to donate they want her
[1:13:15] to buy some lightbulbs well she bought
[1:13:18] some lightbulbs well a few days later
[1:13:21] they called me I bought some lightbulbs
[1:13:24] willing blockburger this is about as
[1:13:26] good as the police department I don't
[1:13:29] make no joke out of that point it's just
[1:13:31] they didn't last too long
[1:13:34] so ever since then when something comes
[1:13:35] up about light bulbs everybody gets me
[1:13:38] and Lisa about the light
[1:13:40] alright you ain't gonna need no light
[1:13:44] bub in the future home you know in the
[1:13:48] millennium you can have new moons and
[1:13:49] Sabbath's come on in the millenniums you
[1:13:54] have new moons and Salva you don't have
[1:13:56] no new moons and Sabbath's in the future
[1:13:58] because everything is eternal that's
[1:14:01] what I said we we're sitting here
[1:14:03] thinking boy if we could just get
[1:14:05] through the millennium know somebody's
[1:14:11] got to go beyond our and for somebody to
[1:14:14] go beyond our he's gonna have to be
[1:14:16] revealed here how we get there come home
[1:14:21] you see since any question excuse me on
[1:14:24] Star Trek hold it a minute musician any
[1:14:27] questions you mean I didn't arouse no
[1:14:34] question that means one or two things
[1:14:38] you didn't understand me all mixed up
[1:14:41] one no I'm just kidding come on you see
[1:14:44] you have some questions write them down
[1:14:46] I love questions come to the Bible study
[1:14:49] you'll find out we have a good time we
[1:14:54] have a good time asking questions I have
[1:15:01] two or three in relation to back part of
[1:15:03] the message if we get any more of our
[1:15:05] Sunday we'll cover them cuz I love
[1:15:07] questions you know but I don't love
[1:15:12] questions because question of gender
[1:15:14] strife you got the scripture but now may
[1:15:19] I quote the prophet not to change the
[1:15:25] scripture well what did the prophets say
[1:15:29] questions makes a strong Church that's
[1:15:34] what he says
[1:15:36] questions makes a strong Church when I
[1:15:40] say it this way questions with answers
[1:15:43] to them makes a strong Church I'm not
[1:15:46] correcting him
[1:15:47] I'm just saying much truth if we just
[1:15:50] all have questions that ask on
[1:15:53] gender strife right but if we have
[1:15:58] questions with answers and a wonderful
[1:16:04] day going brother well we got less time
[1:16:06] think on these things
[1:16:08] five manifestations of God so the man
[1:16:13] son of God sort of man son of David all
[1:16:18] in all the son himself becomes subject
[1:16:25] and God just hovers over him because God
[1:16:28] is a spirit you can't see him you'll
[1:16:32] always have to have a form to live in to
[1:16:37] make yourself manifest would you know he
[1:16:40] chose that come on let us make man in
[1:16:45] our own image right did he choose the
[1:16:51] way we are did he choose the way he is

[1:20:11] everything
[1:20:14] another will do
[1:20:19] what about it what are you looking
[1:20:23] forward to you think we're gonna get up
[1:20:26] into heaven and it says it's gonna be I
[1:20:28] know what a lot of I've heard this
[1:20:30] talking to message me maybe you hadn't
[1:20:32] but I heard that ain't gonna be no
[1:20:33] garden when we get up there we just
[1:20:35] gonna see each other never heard that
[1:20:38] one we just gonna see each other and we
[1:20:41] gonna be God now that's going just a
[1:20:43] little bit too far you'll see you're
[1:20:47] doing away with something I've never
[1:20:50] taught anything in God about doing away
[1:20:52] he never does away
[1:20:54] he keeps increasing come on church now
[1:20:58] listen we can go for the millennium and
[1:21:02] then go to the future home but remember
[1:21:04] they'll be the according to the Prophet
[1:21:06] there'll be a message of cheer down
[1:21:08] through the ages after we get out of
[1:21:11] here so it's not over with it's just
[1:21:15] getting us the place to where we can
[1:21:17] understand
[1:21:21] God will see him
[1:21:24] we'll be like him we'll have a body like
[1:21:27] unto his own glorious body we'll see him
[1:21:31] as he is you know what then wouldn't it
[1:21:36] be something if he could take your
[1:21:37] revelation back up in time towards Jesus
[1:21:41] was standing there and said if Philip
[1:21:43] how have I been so long we have you've
[1:21:46] seen me you've seen the father
