[2:49] lot of other things to do so we'll try

[2:53] everything but
[2:57] isaiah 53
[3:00] heavenly father we thank you for the
[3:02] grace and love that you've bestowed upon
[3:04] us and thank you for everything we ask
[3:06] you now that you would just be with us
[3:08] and that you'd guide us in your love and
[3:10] let your light shine
[3:11] into our hearts that we may follow into
[3:14] you and your word and just walk in the
[3:16] light and see the hour that we're living
[3:18] because that's the major point on our
[3:20] thoughts today is to see right where
[3:22] we're at and what's going on and we ask
[3:24] you to just have your way lord be with
[3:26] the sick ones among us remember the ones
[3:29] lord darby brother isles just to anand
[3:31] for
[3:32] lord for
[3:33] brother dale be with him and lord just
[3:35] touch him be with sister
[3:39] sister trudy and all of the different
[3:41] ones that are sick among us and needing

[4:02] blood and just have your way let it it
[4:05] be you that would answer all of our
[4:07] prayers and our thoughts in jesus name
[4:10] amen
[4:11] so that's
[4:12] isaiah 50
[4:14] 9
[4:20] so shall they fear the name of the lord
[4:22] from the west and his glory from the
[4:24] rising of the sun
[4:26] when the enemy shall come in like a
[4:28] flood the spirit of the lord shall raise
[4:31] up a standard against him
[4:33] and the redeemer shall come to zion and
[4:35] unto
[4:36] and unto them that turned
[4:39] from transgressions in jacob saith the
[4:41] lord so to come to zion come to the
[4:42] bride zion is the bride the church
[4:45] you know the true bride as for me this
[4:47] is my covenant with them saith the lord
[4:50] my spirit that is upon thee and my
[4:53] words which i have put in thy mouth
[4:55] shall not depart out of thy mouth or out
[4:58] of the mouth of thy seed
[5:01] nor out of the mouth of this thy seed
[5:03] seed saith the lord
[5:06] saith the lord from henceforth and
[5:08] forever you may be seated the lord at
[5:11] his blessing to the reading of the word
[5:14] we'll try to back up
[5:17] a little bit in our thoughts to not lose
[5:19] anyone but to
[5:20] to try to continue on and we'll
[5:22] take taking this part
[5:24] because i just decided to take a time
[5:27] while we were
[5:28] well i was kind of
[5:30] under the point because i didn't have
[5:31] any problems like i said i was a
[5:33] negative the whole time but my wife was
[5:35] positive so i couldn't i had to stay and
[5:37] take care of her and doing the the
[5:39] things and and you know being in the
[5:42] home there but the lord just took care
[5:44] of all of that
[5:46] but he gave me time to think things over
[5:48] and try to look up a few things and just
[5:51] you know meditate upon
[5:53] the hour that we're living and that's
[5:55] what i'm trying to get us to see
[5:57] even now the things that it's so
[5:59] prevalent
[6:01] that how could you turn against seeing
[6:03] it amen you know
[6:05] we're looking for this to happen we're
[6:07] looking for that to happen and right
[6:08] among us it's just going right along
[6:10] just as easy and everything's going
[6:12] right on time and and all like that and
[6:15] the churches and things everything's
[6:17] getting just right
[6:18] setting it up to where that uh all can
[6:20] be handled the government's getting it
[6:22] from there and that's what we'll be
[6:23] dealing with a little bit this not
[6:25] trying to be a doomsday but to be honest
[6:27] and straight as to the hour that we're
[6:29] living and what's taking place because
[6:32] satan is is running like a roaring lion
[6:35] but we promised because we read that so
[6:38] we're not
[6:39] that far down we're talking about what
[6:40] now persecution
[6:42] from persecution to revival now that's
[6:45] uh odd situation right because it it
[6:48] doesn't seem to fit
[6:50] but it does if we take it in the right
[6:52] order and follow it in line because
[6:56] as i said we you take each church age
[6:59] in each church age you would have a
[7:00] messenger come forth that would be a
[7:02] great revival it would run you know
[7:05] martin luther the just shall live by
[7:06] faith he preached that message
[7:08] but the reason he could come on the
[7:10] scene and do as he did was because of
[7:12] the depressions
[7:14] the
[7:15] persecutions and the things that had
[7:17] been prior to that it made the people to
[7:20] start thinking and they get just a
[7:22] little
[7:23] if you get a little thought in people's
[7:24] mind that's i found that out a long time
[7:27] ago i don't try to make them i don't try
[7:30] to get a big thought to you
[7:32] i've learned that that's hard to do
[7:34] sometimes because you you're trying to
[7:35] get a and i may think you know you may
[7:38] think i do because of the way that i
[7:40] preach and the way i go but i'm trying
[7:42] to get one little point
[7:44] because if i can get brother zach just
[7:47] one little point
[7:49] and see for a while he's going to think
[7:51] about that
[7:53] he's going to consider that
[7:55] he's going to go as like a like i've
[7:57] always said about you know you didn't
[7:59] think about the name being in the bible
[8:01] name you know you didn't think too much
[8:03] about it
[8:04] you know well there it is it's in there
[8:06] it's that way but then you come to
[8:08] to the point of you know getting
[8:10] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[8:12] christ well see you get concerned of
[8:14] saying it's a name
[8:16] well you know what then every page you
[8:17] turn in the bible everything you look at
[8:20] it has got something about the name
[8:22] because that's that little thing that's
[8:23] clicked right
[8:26] just get that little thought
[8:28] and and get it to the people and it'll
[8:30] carry on
[8:32] because that's the way that it's
[8:33] supposed to be and it'll it'll run then
[8:36] in the right way so see luther
[8:39] he's seen what had happened to all the
[8:41] the church and what you know
[8:44] the systems was throughout there and
[8:45] coming up into that point and he's seen
[8:48] all of that and he he's
[8:50] cried out against it
[8:52] and when he did it started a revival in
[8:54] the hearts of the people
[8:56] so then it's not bad to think about that
[8:58] we're going through times of of
[9:00] persecution
[9:02] you say well we're not and we're not
[9:03] we're not being persecuted we're not uh
[9:06] dying for our faith and and doing but
[9:10] we're just being
[9:11] slowly gradually the devil's doing that
[9:14] too getting a little bit
[9:16] of something in there to make us think
[9:18] on and then and he's got it to go into
[9:21] where that you know you get that point
[9:23] in your mind of what he's doing it'll
[9:25] work the same way for him and he'll get
[9:27] his thought in and and all and you it
[9:30] just comes in so flattery you know
[9:32] because that's what the bible said he
[9:33] would do
[9:34] he'd come in by flattery come in
[9:37] so easy that means you invite him in
[9:40] and i remember years ago i i don't know
[9:42] about it now but the uh
[9:44] when i was thinking on that probably
[9:46] maybe 10 15 years ago something like i
[9:48] don't know but at that time
[9:50] the specific time the world the uh
[9:53] catholic church was not a member of the
[9:54] world council of churches
[9:56] he said well they started no they didn't
[9:58] started it
[9:59] they weren't a member of the world
[10:01] council churches at the time that's 20
[10:02] 30 years ago down the line
[10:04] see but they've been invited in
[10:07] because at that time
[10:09] they were people voted in
[10:12] to the
[10:14] church system
[10:15] that you know ministers and big guys
[10:18] with the names and
[10:19] to to be a part of it that were not even
[10:23] voted into the cattle they weren't they
[10:24] you know they they weren't supposed to
[10:26] be there that line they
[10:27] they brought them in by flattery
[10:30] to get everything to do with it and you
[10:32] say well now you know i mean hey
[10:36] we don't have
[10:37] the the guy that's the pope now i mean i
[10:39] have nothing against him he's not a he's
[10:41] not a um
[10:43] adolf hitler going out and killing
[10:45] everybody and doing this and that and
[10:46] the other he's a nice guy
[10:48] you know i mean things are going pretty
[10:50] good on a lot of scales and and stuff
[10:52] like that so it's not a
[10:54] something that's you know out of order
[10:57] so it's not something we're looking for
[10:58] something to be bad a big thing come up
[11:01] you know the image to the beast and
[11:02] stuff like that and we looked at it like
[11:05] i remember my brother was a baptist
[11:07] preacher brother-in-law excuse me was a
[11:09] baptist preacher and we were talking
[11:11] about the
[11:12] the great beast of revelations are you
[11:14] know that comes up and he's walking
[11:17] across the land you know and things and
[11:19] and i said what do you think about that
[11:22] you know he said yes and one of these
[11:23] days said there'll be a great big animal
[11:25] just stand up and just walk across the
[11:28] earth
[11:28] well i said
[11:31] a big old animal like a king kong
[11:35] and he said yeah i said that's what
[11:37] it'll be i said well where's the
[11:38] deceiving part
[11:41] i thought it was supposed to be a beast
[11:42] raise up and deceiving but see he had
[11:44] that beast as literal
[11:47] well we want to know by now it's not
[11:49] that way
[11:50] i told him i said where do you think a
[11:52] big king kong is going to deceive me i
[11:54] said no it'd be the best thing try to
[11:56] get rid of him
[11:58] but the thing of it is see we get our
[12:00] minds set by what we've been taught
[12:04] okay and and the people of this message
[12:07] has been taught some things you know
[12:09] that i've been against them from a very
[12:11] beginning in the basis of trying to get
[12:14] to people to see when brother branham is
[12:16] talking about something look at what
[12:18] he's talking about but remember he's
[12:20] talking about something related to me
[12:22] and you so let's get this thing to be
[12:25] important to us or the thoughts to us
[12:27] that's right you know what's going on in
[12:29] the land today i'm trying to get you to
[12:31] look at it
[12:33] that six months ago we had nothing to
[12:35] worry about we were everything was
[12:37] running you know i mean the economy was
[12:39] the best it had been in many years
[12:42] and things and it was just uh
[12:44] going grave and all at once it just
[12:47] you know well
[12:49] what had happened
[12:52] see
[12:53] the people of the end time message had
[12:55] turned down the message on the basis of
[12:57] what the prophet was teaching
[12:59] as it did then god is putting the church
[13:02] under persecution
[13:04] driver to her knees
[13:06] because that way she's going to do one
[13:07] or two she's going to get out or get in
[13:11] and you say well you mean god would do
[13:13] those things god will do things to try
[13:15] you and me to see if we're going to
[13:17] stand for the truth or not that's right
[13:19] he'll do that because that's his part
[13:21] because remember he's on the end of
[13:23] looking at it he knows the beginning for
[13:25] the ending
[13:26] he knows what you're going to do he he's
[13:28] not concerned well if i do this see i i
[13:31] say well if i said something brother
[13:33] donnie i might hurt his feelings and
[13:34] cause him to get mad at me and say god
[13:36] ain't that away
[13:37] god knows exactly what he's thinking
[13:39] right now and knows exactly what he'll
[13:40] think 10 years from now and and he knows
[13:43] all about it he don't have to worry
[13:44] about it he's got to figure out am i
[13:46] going to hurt her feelings
[13:48] because he's a pretty good uh oh brother
[13:50] gary atkins he's in the way he'd always
[13:52] say he said god is a
[13:54] is a good razor of children
[13:56] you know because the bible says you know
[13:58] raise up a child and wet she'll go or
[14:00] even says beat a child it won't die
[14:02] you know i mean you know the lord's
[14:04] pretty strong sometimes he
[14:07] he says it and means it and means it and
[14:09] you know we're supposed to follow it but
[14:12] all right but now that's what i'm
[14:14] getting at or what i was talking about
[14:15] we're trying to use some of the quotes
[14:17] this morning to bring it down to a point
[14:19] of thinking about
[14:22] that here we are in the last days now
[14:24] what are you expecting brother dale
[14:27] there's a great
[14:29] depression going on right now
[14:32] it's the world system and i'm talking
[14:34] about a full world system
[14:36] we were ending up our thoughts this
[14:37] morning see there has never been
[14:40] a time
[14:41] that there has been a uh depression etc
[14:46] uh whatever worldwide
[14:48] never been a time that there's been a
[14:51] uh plague
[14:52] or a virus or of because i can't
[14:55] pronounce them you
[14:57] i can't get all that in there straight
[14:59] so i call it a a you know just a a virus
[15:03] cause that's what it is you know but see
[15:06] it it's
[15:07] it's never been like this
[15:09] it's all over the world
[15:12] everybody is concerned with it some of
[15:14] those countries over there are just
[15:15] totally shut down
[15:18] now you just think about the the uh say
[15:20] because i don't know that much about it
[15:22] but had a little opportunity to be go
[15:24] back to jamaica well see you'd go there
[15:26] and you look around and you say hey
[15:29] their economy is built on
[15:32] people coming here as visitors
[15:34] tourists
[15:35] well you do away with that
[15:39] what have you got man they just busted
[15:42] i mean the poor old people they ain't
[15:43] got a thing
[15:44] they ain't got no hopes like my wife
[15:46] used to doing with gorge he said why
[15:48] don't they get up enough money and leave
[15:49] here and go to america i said where are
[15:51] you gonna get the
[15:52] money i said
[15:54] they can't make no money they're doing
[15:56] the best they can to even eat off the
[15:58] trees that's around here
[16:00] but now see that's my point
[16:06] looking at uh recessions and
[16:09] and depressions and things like that is
[16:11] a horrible thing we know that it's it's
[16:13] bad you know for people to be hungry and
[16:16] you just think of all of this and i mean
[16:18] my wife she uh you know darcy everybody
[16:21] know she was in the
[16:22] hospital twice during the times and
[16:24] because she got worried she couldn't
[16:26] breathe and things so i had to take her
[16:28] and uh i mean you know they put her
[16:30] right in
[16:32] and and uh
[16:34] you know the old day of going to the
[16:35] hospital
[16:36] first thing they've done is what iv
[16:39] start running the fluids right it
[16:41] doesn't matter what you're in there for
[16:44] they gotta have a bit you know
[16:46] you got that
[16:48] but they put her in there kept her
[16:49] overnight and everything else moved her
[16:51] from one place to the other they said
[16:52] never gave her about to eat she had to
[16:54] just about beg them to get some water to
[16:56] drink and they were telling them that
[16:58] they could not
[16:59] you know give her maybe these things or
[17:02] something because it it's it's what they
[17:04] was looking for and she was trying to
[17:06] tell us oh here's the sinus problems
[17:08] that's bothering me here and they say
[17:09] yeah but we're we're not interested in
[17:11] that that's not our concern we're
[17:12] concerned with the heart we're concerned
[17:14] with the lungs and those those things
[17:16] and said we can give you something to
[17:17] take care of those other but they never
[17:19] give her nothing sent her back home with
[17:21] nothing
[17:23] i mean literally she went upstate all
[17:24] night long the hospital came back not
[17:27] even an aspirin
[17:29] not even a thing they didn't give her
[17:31] nothing
[17:32] you know why
[17:35] because they run the test to see if she
[17:37] was
[17:39] positive
[17:41] and according to their book
[17:43] we don't do anything till we find out if
[17:45] she's positive
[17:47] then if she's positive we'll go do this
[17:51] when you think the world would never
[17:53] come to a place like that where that you
[17:54] would actually beg for something in a
[17:56] hospital
[17:58] and there she come out of the hospital
[18:01] and even though they proved the point of
[18:03] it you know of her being contagious as
[18:05] we call it
[18:06] they just sit at home
[18:10] they didn't give you no they didn't give
[18:11] us no guideline book
[18:13] they didn't tell us what to do
[18:16] they just put out the door
[18:18] they called me up hey i was at home
[18:20] because i couldn't go in that thing call
[18:21] me up come get me
[18:24] well then she got real sick again a few
[18:26] days later and i took her back to the
[18:27] hospital
[18:28] well they tried a little bit different
[18:30] things but still my point is
[18:33] they wound up with this virus thing that
[18:35] they've got now they've got books
[18:38] ways and things they're not going to do
[18:40] nothing
[18:42] they're not going to treat you
[18:45] call you if you're positive
[18:48] any of you has ever been positive or not
[18:50] but say if i'm positive or use positive
[18:54] call the doctor
[18:56] you can't go to the office
[19:02] they won't they will not allow you in
[19:03] the office
[19:07] you say oh yes they will they'll do i i
[19:09] can go down there and demand
[19:14] when i took my wife in the first time i
[19:16] walked in the door with her and i was
[19:17] lucky to do that
[19:19] because if we went in the front door
[19:21] it would have just been you up here
[19:23] right now
[19:24] let me just say like take your wife up
[19:26] there she's sick you walk up to the
[19:27] front door
[19:29] that's it you ain't going to see her
[19:30] until they dismiss her
[19:34] right
[19:35] he's all you're crying that's right come
[19:37] on
[19:40] go friend ask him about it it won't work
[19:44] they told me the guy told me he said you
[19:46] ain't gonna go no further
[19:49] well i didn't even get a chance to tell
[19:50] my wife goodbye because the lady called
[19:52] me told me to turn around what's your
[19:53] name i turned around here they're gone
[19:58] i didn't go in with her nowhere
[20:00] i went up there to get her i went back
[20:01] to the
[20:04] to the front door part of it and i mean
[20:06] they they rolled her right out the
[20:08] parking lot
[20:10] i told that lady i said well i'll go
[20:11] park and come back she said park your
[20:13] car right there said they'll be out here
[20:15] with her in a little bit
[20:17] okay
[20:19] i mean it wasn't me going into hospital
[20:21] and getting her to come out they rolled
[20:22] her right back out
[20:25] what's your point my point is one thing
[20:26] they're doing what they what they've got
[20:28] the books and lines and the things those
[20:30] guidelines have told them to do this
[20:33] check the heart check the lungs
[20:36] don't worry about nothing else
[20:40] do you know that every time you enter
[20:42] the hospital you're going to be tested
[20:46] you're tested for a virus as quick as
[20:48] you enter the hospital
[20:52] you say yeah but they can't do those
[20:54] things
[20:55] what are you going to do
[20:58] call your house of representative
[21:02] tilly nemesis hospital
[21:07] you understand
[21:08] my point is what we have reached a stage
[21:12] that i hope to god that it'll open the
[21:14] eyes to people that are at least
[21:16] listening to what i'm saying to the
[21:18] point of one thing
[21:19] we're at a place now they can do
[21:21] anything they want to do and there's
[21:23] nothing you can do about it
[21:26] i'll get me a lawyer
[21:28] he ain't getting in the hospital
[21:32] if he is he's tested for a virus and
[21:34] throws in the bed
[21:39] my wife are telling him i need something
[21:41] to drink i need some bathrooms right
[21:43] around there
[21:44] they didn't get her up and take her
[21:46] around there she had to go
[21:48] i mean they just
[21:51] why because it's the point that they
[21:52] just they're set to do what they're
[21:54] doing
[21:57] i ain't saying that the nurse is his
[21:58] problem
[22:00] see they just so shortcut until they had
[22:02] to do
[22:03] man i turned around when when i was
[22:05] looking for a wife i turned around and
[22:06] looked down through the hall oh my lord
[22:09] is all these people
[22:10] sick because all i could see for a
[22:13] hundred foot was people this is jesus
[22:16] it's like that
[22:18] you know
[22:19] and he said you're not going no further
[22:21] i didn't want to go no further
[22:25] but you understand my point
[22:27] my point is one thing
[22:29] don't get it in your mind that you are
[22:32] so special of people you are this you
[22:35] are that and you're not going to have
[22:37] problems
[22:40] and don't get it in your mind that god
[22:42] is going to daddy you like a a dodie old
[22:45] granddaddy
[22:47] he wants to know if his children will
[22:48] stand for the word that's right
[22:50] if he's got to put us through tests and
[22:52] trials he'll put us through it
[22:57] you remember the story i always tell of
[22:58] the two times in the bible there were
[23:00] you know
[23:02] if if a prophet come and give you a sign
[23:04] and it come to pass you're supposed to
[23:05] hear them
[23:06] but there's another one in earth he
[23:08] comes and gives you a sign and it comes
[23:10] to piss
[23:11] but he leads you to other gods
[23:13] don't hear him because i sent him among
[23:16] you to test you and try you
[23:22] i love to get those quotes where the
[23:24] prophet said
[23:25] god wants us the the devil to see
[23:30] who he's fighting against
[23:32] well i want him to know who i'm fighting
[23:34] i'm like this i'm sorry i'm just human
[23:36] and the way i talk is crazy i know it
[23:38] i'm i'm never mad at the devil old
[23:40] people say i'm so mad at the devil i'm
[23:42] just so mad at i just i would love to
[23:44] beat him up i would
[23:49] he love help being who he is and what he
[23:52] is
[23:54] he's doing a good job
[23:57] and you know what he's driving you to
[23:58] the lord amen
[23:59] amen
[24:01] he beat them children of israel
[24:04] until they was ready to leave egypt but
[24:10] you say yeah but i just can't see it
[24:11] well why not read your bible one time
[24:14] and see what you're talking about the
[24:15] things
[24:18] and you'll see that we're right here at
[24:19] the end
[24:22] well right here now at the point of what
[24:24] we looked at at times past
[24:26] and tried to figure out what did this
[24:28] mean what does that mean what is to come
[24:30] in the end time how is it to be what is
[24:32] to bring this to pisces
[24:36] and none of us had any idea
[24:39] when we read things
[24:41] we had a concept or a thought
[24:44] but no but now we're living it
[24:48] that's right that's
[24:50] you don't get nothing out of the message
[24:51] today get that one thing this has been
[24:53] on my heart for months and years really
[24:55] to try to get you to see where we are
[24:57] right now
[25:01] and that's not doomsday because that's
[25:02] what i titled a message to her that it
[25:05] would even the message title from
[25:07] persecution
[25:10] to revival
[25:12] but my approach is from what persecution
[25:16] is what drives us to our knees and
[25:18] driving us to the knees brings god on
[25:20] the scene and god coming on the scene he
[25:23] revives us
[25:27] so it's not to say we're glad for the
[25:29] doomsdays
[25:31] no i'm glad to have the truth for the
[25:33] doomsday
[25:35] that's right yes sir
[25:38] it may not mean a thing in the world to
[25:40] you but it's just like i said there this
[25:41] morning where i heard this brother had
[25:43] said that you know the bride wouldn't
[25:45] take none of these viruses the real true
[25:47] bride now
[25:49] i don't agree with it
[25:51] you know why
[25:53] because i watched my wife for two months
[25:56] going through horrible
[25:58] in and out of hospitals and all like
[26:00] that i believe she's a part of the bride
[26:02] of christ
[26:06] but i've seen that to word at it
[26:08] seemingly that pray and god wouldn't
[26:09] even seem to hear me
[26:12] i'd pray and ask him said lord have i
[26:15] done something wrong
[26:17] reveal to me is something wrong i'm her
[26:19] pastor
[26:24] yeah
[26:25] but you see
[26:27] sometimes then you'd have to just sit
[26:29] down and think
[26:31] and listen
[26:33] and eventually he'll find you somewhere
[26:34] and talk to you
[26:39] and you go through a couple of months
[26:40] with this horrible like but didn't come
[26:42] out of it thinking like this you know
[26:44] what
[26:45] to think
[26:47] that my wife was to the point that god
[26:50] could trust her to be what she's
[26:53] supposed to be and he would trust her
[26:55] and allow the devil to get after with
[26:57] all of his sicknesses and things
[27:00] because that's what we're supposed to do
[27:05] we're supposed to be happy whatever
[27:07] takes place
[27:09] that's right and to realize then that
[27:11] satan cannot get to you and me when the
[27:14] enemy comes in like a flood it doesn't
[27:16] say the enemy comes through now when the
[27:18] enemy comes in like then god will raise
[27:20] up a standard that's right
[27:24] and that's what he's doing now
[27:26] see if we'll just listen to that and
[27:27] take it from there on and go
[27:31] and say all right satan bring it on
[27:36] it's nice to think that your name is
[27:37] thought of in heaven
[27:41] well ain't doing too good i'm sick
[27:44] it's like i told a lady one time i said
[27:45] the bible said all things to work
[27:47] together for good she said look you're
[27:49] telling me that said my husband is dead
[27:51] and said my son has stopped her
[27:53] she knows what i meant i mean the boy
[27:55] was
[27:56] a little off a little bit you know and
[27:57] said you say that that's
[28:01] that i'm supposed to be content
[28:04] well see she never thought anything
[28:05] whatsoever about what i was talking
[28:07] about
[28:10] the bible says whatever state you're in
[28:14] do you realize that
[28:19] that he would actually think enough of
[28:21] you
[28:22] to turn the devil loose on you
[28:28] but there's one thing he always says
[28:31] you can only go so far
[28:35] right
[28:37] only so far satan you ain't going to get
[28:39] his life
[28:40] you can do this you can take his family
[28:41] you can take all these things he said
[28:42] you ain't getting his wife
[28:44] because she was part of his life
[28:47] and they ain't getting you he can't take
[28:49] you down amen
[28:51] come on that's right we're to change our
[28:53] thoughts about what we're doing instead
[28:55] of thinking that we're oh we're pity by
[28:56] the way
[28:57] we didn't have so many problems i like
[29:00] brother foreign in that wowzy wowzy woo
[29:02] i want to get to hear that again
[29:05] i'm glad he's on he's up preaching
[29:08] we need him amen
[29:10] we need to ministry in this message to
[29:12] declare the thing and sometimes you got
[29:14] to go through a whole
[29:15] bunch of troubles and heartaches and
[29:17] trials to wind up with the right answer
[29:21] to be able to see
[29:23] but listen let's let's let's get a few
[29:25] more of these quotes we were doing this
[29:27] morning and then let's get to a thought
[29:30] all right let's go back to number nine
[29:32] that you was this morning uh
[29:37] oh yeah thank you i wrote my won't have
[29:39] a note and forgot it uh thank everybody
[29:42] for coming our you know our anniversary
[29:44] was uh
[29:45] thursday i mean a friday friday the
[29:48] seventh
[29:49] of this month and uh you know it was
[29:52] nice to have people to come
[29:54] when they know hey you got to stay over
[29:56] there because you're supposed to be
[29:57] contagious you know and you stay over
[29:59] there we come over here and we try to do
[30:02] the best we could to be not but to think
[30:04] that there was a lot of you chose to
[30:06] come that day
[30:07] and and fellowship our anniversary
[30:10] our 62nd anniversary now that's that's
[30:14] that was a good and i'm glad of you of
[30:16] you getting to come in to do okay all
[30:18] right let's go let's go to number
[30:20] let's pick up on number
[30:23] nine okay now we've done read maybe some
[30:25] of this but we'll get the point what are
[30:27] we trying what is our point what is our
[30:28] thought
[30:32] the bride of jesus christ we're not
[30:33] concerned with the jews we're not
[30:35] concerned with the foolish virgins we're
[30:37] not concerned with those things we're
[30:39] concerned with the things that are said
[30:41] in relation to the bride of jesus christ
[30:43] all right and the bride of jesus christ
[30:46] that there's going to be persecution
[30:48] brought upon the people that are even
[30:50] the true bride of christ
[30:52] but see that's where we think but god
[30:54] would not let us put go through these
[30:57] troubles and things that's where you
[30:59] don't know god that's right
[31:02] you think you do you don't know god he's
[31:05] doing that to try to make something out
[31:07] of us instead of tearing us down
[31:10] right
[31:11] now listen
[31:13] and what about that's what made me think
[31:15] of the wade was joking him the other day
[31:17] what about he lost everything
[31:19] multi-millionaire form as we call it
[31:21] today lost everybody that lost all of
[31:23] his kids lost everything he had
[31:29] yet when he
[31:30] finished he had a revival
[31:33] because he had double his animals and
[31:36] double his children right man and now
[31:38] you remember what that was not double
[31:40] his children i forgot how many had
[31:42] anybody
[31:43] had seven and died so see god gave him
[31:46] seven
[31:48] more not seven more numbers he didn't
[31:50] get 14 kids
[31:51] he made sure these you know this seven
[31:53] over and glory was his
[31:55] and this seven over here was he that's
[31:57] the 14 you get out of it you know and
[32:00] bring it because that was that was his
[32:01] point you know he gave him them all
[32:03] right
[32:05] so then let's look at the church system
[32:07] and see what's taking place and then
[32:08] we'll see just for a minute what what is
[32:10] going to be done in the future of that
[32:13] it is in this age that the churches are
[32:15] going to come together
[32:16] and as they even now
[32:18] are even now controlling world politics
[32:22] now you see what they're doing now
[32:24] they're controlling the politics
[32:27] okay they put in who they want to and
[32:29] take out who they want to
[32:31] all right they will soon control the
[32:33] finances of the world why because
[32:35] they're going to make a covenant
[32:37] all right
[32:40] and then if you don't belong to the
[32:41] world organization of churches
[32:43] you won't be able to buy or sell
[32:45] you will lose all
[32:48] okay
[32:50] those who stay true to god and keep
[32:52] their garments clean from the defilement
[32:54] of this world system of church
[32:57] church orders will be physically beraff
[33:04] you know that's what i said you go ahead
[33:05] and do what you want to you say oh
[33:06] that's foolish virgins brother dale you
[33:09] just don't understand
[33:10] i just understand you're scared to death
[33:13] let me back up no way for nothing
[33:16] i know what fear is and i know what
[33:18] it'll do to you
[33:20] and you get that fear in your mind that
[33:22] there's something there that's not right
[33:24] you better get it right
[33:27] because fear is worse than anything in
[33:28] the world i'd rather face any line in
[33:30] the world than to see an act of fear
[33:34] because we could at least stand with god
[33:41] and say come on
[33:44] satan take me
[33:46] but you ain't gonna get all of me
[33:49] because there's something inside of here
[33:52] that you can't touch
[33:54] you can't move it from that listen
[33:58] so there will be presented to them a
[34:00] great temptation to give in preachers
[34:02] will give in with the excuse that they
[34:05] will serve god within the framework of
[34:08] the
[34:09] antichrist beast system they will give
[34:12] in to the flatteries
[34:14] and banishments of the hierarchy
[34:17] comes to mind brother tom brother tom
[34:19] fox bush he he saw the water baptism he
[34:22] was a methodist and i think that's right
[34:24] method yeah and uh so he goes and gets a
[34:27] an audience with a pastor and it's three
[34:30] or four thousand people you know so he
[34:31] got a chance to talk to him and he went
[34:34] in and
[34:35] he started talking to him
[34:37] and an old pastor was a good old pastor
[34:40] you know i could just see him now he
[34:41] just said he asked her and tom was
[34:44] telling him this was wrong and that was
[34:45] wrong yes sir yes sir and all i can tom
[34:49] he was just i'd got it walked out but
[34:50] tom's like here
[34:52] he said
[34:53] now what are you going to do about it
[34:56] and the guy said do about what
[34:59] he said what are you going to do about
[35:00] that water baptism
[35:03] he said i'm going to just have to stay
[35:06] with what my
[35:07] my
[35:08] church doctrine
[35:12] see
[35:13] it didn't make no difference what the
[35:14] word of god said it's going to be his
[35:16] church doctrine
[35:18] listen
[35:19] holding hands with the devil it is time
[35:21] to wake up
[35:22] and hear the voice of god okay run it on
[35:24] over let's go number
[35:26] 10.
[35:28] the false church groups will come
[35:30] together in a world council of churches
[35:32] this world council of churches is the
[35:34] image erected to the beast revelations
[35:37] 13 8 11 through 18 is run under there i
[35:40] cut that and splashed it but that's all
[35:41] right it's not taking nothing out this
[35:44] may seem far-fetched to some but
[35:46] actually it is very plain for all to see
[35:50] because right now the churches are
[35:51] controlling politics and at the
[35:54] opportune time will manifest exactly how
[35:57] great
[35:59] is that control so you say oh well the
[36:02] churches don't control
[36:04] i'm glad you said that
[36:06] the churches don't control that's my
[36:08] point for the whole rest of the evening
[36:09] the church is not the control
[36:11] it's other people
[36:14] you've got to worry about the church
[36:17] it's the people
[36:18] you say well the people's the church
[36:20] okay what can i call you
[36:22] he says this ecumenical move will end up
[36:24] with rome at the head even though the
[36:26] people did not envision
[36:28] it that way how's it going up at the
[36:30] head they're going to vote him ahead
[36:32] now with it in the beasts and the things
[36:34] he
[36:34] you know they vote him in we give him
[36:36] the power
[36:38] we are the people that give the devil
[36:40] the power
[36:43] this is so because in revelation 17 3-6
[36:46] it states that the mystery babylon
[36:49] is seated on the beast she is
[36:51] controlling the lies
[36:52] our fourth empire this roman catholic
[36:55] chur roman church is doing that with the
[36:58] world church system under her
[37:00] rome will
[37:02] be controlling
[37:04] and this image church system will be
[37:07] obedient to the rome because rome
[37:09] controls the gold of the world now
[37:11] there's the key for the rest of for an
[37:13] hour now for we're going to hold women
[37:15] the gold of the world
[37:18] the catholic church
[37:19] back 61 i think it was they had
[37:22] 168 billion
[37:25] dollars ago brother joe gave me a
[37:27] readout of some things that goes with it
[37:29] and uh
[37:30] but you think of what that means today
[37:31] if 1960
[37:34] gold was maybe might have been 100 an
[37:36] ounce but 60. i don't i know it used to
[37:38] be 35 an ounce is what it was
[37:40] and you think now what is 1500 or so an
[37:43] ounce
[37:45] and you take
[37:47] 168 billion
[37:49] and multiplied that by 1500
[37:55] bill gates wouldn't have changed
[37:57] none of them got put them all together
[37:59] and they wouldn't have a chance that's
[38:00] what we're going to get to in a minute
[38:02] what i want you to see is there's
[38:04] something run in this thing
[38:06] this didn't happen haphazardly
[38:08] this virus didn't come into place
[38:10] haphazardly
[38:14] as a fellow out of texas out there i
[38:15] won't quote his name but he said that
[38:19] the thing of it was said the people
[38:21] the the money
[38:23] he said

[38:26] that's doing it there
[38:28] see they're controlling
[38:30] it's not what you see
[38:33] it's not what's out in front of us
[38:35] the thing out in front of us is happy
[38:40] everything's running good
[38:43] it's what you don't
[38:44] see is the danger
[38:47] of what these things is meaning to all
[38:49] of us right watch now
[38:51] does all the people have to belong to
[38:53] the world church system or be at the
[38:54] mercy of the elements
[38:57] for they cannot buy or sell without the
[38:59] mark of the beast in the hand our
[39:02] head let me say this without a big life
[39:05] out of you
[39:07] three months ago you couldn't buy toilet

[39:28] i mean all at once we have toilet paper
[39:31] all at once toilet paper is going
[39:32] sky-high you can't even find it and then
[39:34] a virus hits
[39:39] what's them two got to do with each
[39:41] other
[39:45] that man said
[39:46] he said the chinese knew
[39:51] that they could force us into
[39:54] a worldwide depression
[39:56] some of you may heard him remember it
[39:59] said they knew
[40:00] they could force us into a depression
[40:05] you say what's toilet paper got to do
[40:06] with it right what's got to do with it
[40:08] it just shows it can be done
[40:10] right
[40:13] it's just showing it can be done
[40:18] you couldn't go to the store
[40:22] now come on folks something is going
[40:25] wrong here somebody tell me something
[40:28] because here we are in a day when
[40:31] all these big corporations
[40:34] big things
[40:38] it just shut down
[40:45] airplanes can't fly no more
[40:47] you can't do anything
[40:52] who's in charge
[40:57] i remember when they in the 50s that
[40:59] they had an anti-trust suit against
[41:00] general motors because general motors
[41:02] was bigger than the government
[41:06] and now the government just tell general
[41:08] motor shut down
[41:10] stop all the airplanes shut her down
[41:13] who gives orders
[41:19] somebody did
[41:21] but nobody'll stand up and say
[41:24] if they think
[41:26] china done this why have they not
[41:28] retaliated against china
[41:30] because they can't prove it
[41:36] come on
[41:40] you mean to tell me that china could
[41:42] come up and bring up all of these things
[41:44] and we won't throw a bomb down and we've
[41:45] done it in japan
[41:49] we done it back in world war ii
[41:52] because the country went against us we
[41:53] bombed them
[41:57] but you see somebody
[42:00] is pulling the strings
[42:03] it ain't just what you're looking at
[42:06] i want you to get that little thought in
[42:08] your mind and then just consider the
[42:09] rest of the day of what you're talking
[42:11] about
[42:12] rolling this great
[42:16] power the church system will persecute
[42:18] the true bride
[42:21] you say it ain't coming he said it so go
[42:23] ahead do what you want to
[42:25] this image will try to keep the bride
[42:27] from
[42:27] preaching and teaching
[42:30] her ministers will be forbidden to give
[42:32] comfort and
[42:33] and truth to the people who need it
[42:37] but this is the part i love see that's
[42:38] why i don't i'm not a doomsday
[42:42] but he says it's going to come upon the
[42:44] true bride right you agree with that
[42:46] part up there it's going to come on now
[42:47] i can get this part and agree with it
[42:49] easily then but before the antichrist in
[42:51] person takes over
[42:56] this complete world system before he
[42:58] fully takes everything over
[43:01] of the churches the true bride will be
[43:03] taken away from this world to be with
[43:05] the lord god will catch away his bride
[43:08] it's a great marriage supper we've got
[43:10] something to look forward to we got a
[43:11] wonderful thing laying right ahead of us
[43:15] all right but you've got to go through
[43:17] these steps to get there
[43:20] don't get caught up into the little
[43:22] steps of things
[43:24] you know
[43:25] walk as we walk
[43:29] i ain't going to the white house and say
[43:31] i'll tell you what let's jump now i got
[43:32] this thing figured out i want you to let
[43:34] me in here and up and get me on there
[43:35] and i'll i'll tell the world how to run
[43:38] everything don't want nobody tell them
[43:40] how to run it
[43:45] the guy that's smart enough to run it
[43:47] knows how he's running it and he's doing
[43:48] it
[43:52] it don't have to be one man see we've
[43:54] always looked at the antichrist as being
[43:56] one man
[43:57] remember
[43:59] you've got to have a people
[44:01] with a pope as head of to be an
[44:03] antichrist
[44:05] but not just by one not a pope you know
[44:07] that's right
[44:09] you can't do that you've got to have a
[44:10] system
[44:13] because he's going to stand out that's
[44:15] what i've always told you he's going to
[44:16] stand out and open
[44:18] and the people are going to be so happy
[44:20] about him oh any nice look how nice look
[44:22] what he's doing he's paying off all of
[44:24] our national debt
[44:25] because see the church ain't going to be
[44:27] mentioned that's what i want to get to
[44:29] if i miss it i'll get it later when i
[44:30] preach it
[44:31] it's the point
[44:34] the church ain't out in the open
[44:37] this image to the beast and thing is
[44:39] going to be made to work it will pay off
[44:41] our national debt
[44:43] which national debt would be the
[44:44] worldwide national debt of all the
[44:47] countries that are on the gold standard
[44:53] as i said this morning then if they got
[44:55] 168 billion dollars to go i don't see
[44:57] the vatican and them walking on the gold
[44:59] you know no no that's silly
[45:04] at one time general motors was larger
[45:06] than than the government all right
[45:07] general motors will say had a hundred
[45:09] billion dollars in assets
[45:12] you didn't look around and where's that
[45:14] no that's mine and that's mine that's my
[45:16] pile of million dollar bills that's my
[45:19] you see you're silly that's exactly what
[45:20] i'm trying to get
[45:28] who was it no walton
[45:31] you lost millions of being he said
[45:32] paperwork
[45:34] you don't mean a thing just paperwork
[45:37] you say well get on to watch it okay
[45:38] let's get on to what we're doing
[45:40] come on where are we at we're on number
[45:42] which one i think we're on 10 or 11.
[45:46] all right let's go to 11.
[45:49] now watch him this is from the message
[45:50] spoken word of the original seat now i
[45:52] believe with all my heart
[45:57] that's the way it'll wind up
[46:00] there will be like a union
[46:03] a boycott
[46:04] all such places as this here will be
[46:07] closed down
[46:08] and you'll not be able to speak unless
[46:10] you've got a
[46:12] prim permission or a license from this
[46:16] federation of churches
[46:18] to hold a service
[46:20] it's almost as shows it does that now
[46:23] even in the denomination shows where
[46:26] it's at yes sir you have to have it
[46:29] and that's where it'll wind up at
[46:32] that's my prediction now listen to it
[46:35] that's what i don't mind giving all the
[46:36] holy what i said because i'm trying my
[46:38] best you ain't gonna come up well
[46:39] brother dale i found one you didn't find
[46:41] out that's the prediction
[46:43] now i'm going to show you the prophet
[46:44] said the prediction but i'd rather have
[46:45] the prophet's prediction then your thus
[46:47] saith the lord
[46:50] and you hurt feelings
[46:52] right put them in a seat in the bridge
[46:53] and sit down
[46:56] listen
[46:58] and that's where it'll wind up at
[47:01] that's my prediction as a servant of
[47:03] christ through the understanding that i
[47:05] have of the word and the inspiration
[47:08] that's where he'll come the all signs
[47:11] are pointing to the end i just got
[47:13] through speaking on that and it's even
[47:16] to the the unwise virgins with the
[47:18] beginning and i'll go ahead and run it
[47:20] on up and thank you
[47:21] no okay go ahead then number 12.
[47:26] this is from a super sign 62.
[47:28] let me make a prediction
[47:31] i'm not prophesying
[47:32] i'm predicting
[47:35] okay
[47:36] i predict that in the next few years
[47:40] that all organizations
[47:42] organization religions will be forced to
[47:45] take a stand
[47:46] and they will have a union of churches
[47:49] and a great boycott will follow this
[47:51] union of churches all denominations will
[47:54] be forced into
[47:55] it
[47:56] all of them
[47:58] if they don't there will be a horrible
[48:00] boycott
[48:02] nearly every one of them today has not
[48:05] knowingly joined the that world council
[48:08] of churches
[48:10] selling their birthrights
[48:14] protestants brothers
[48:16] with a mother catholic rome they'll do
[48:19] that you know the bible said that the
[48:21] tires will be bound
[48:23] bonnell first they are bundling all in
[48:25] one great group
[48:27] the bible said they would make an image
[48:30] unto the beast i believe it will come in
[48:33] come to price that shortly that if
[48:36] people do not join some organization
[48:39] some churches go into their own doors
[48:41] will be closed
[48:43] okay
[48:44] let's go got a couple more then i want
[48:45] to slam the one and we'll quit then
[48:48] questions and answers 1959
[48:50] then the dragon spurts water out of his
[48:52] mouth to make war with the remnant of
[48:55] the seed
[48:56] that's when you you protestant churches
[48:59] under the federal federal federation
[49:03] of churches which is the image to the
[49:05] beast which is now being formed and
[49:08] there will be a boycott upon all
[49:10] churches like this
[49:12] like we're in a great tax gathering
[49:14] right now here now
[49:17] now that's him
[49:19] because remember what there was they had
[49:20] the tax case against him
[49:23] okay listen like we're in the great tax
[49:26] gathering right here now a dispute
[49:28] trying to say that there we're not a
[49:30] church
[49:31] we've got a constitutional right to say
[49:33] that we're a church
[49:36] all right come on wrote enough
[49:38] we've broken every constitutional law
[49:40] that they can break and soon the
[49:41] federation of churches which all the
[49:44] churches and the denominations are
[49:46] invited into and the devil's got in and
[49:49] making
[49:50] worldliness and everything else in local
[49:52] churches members so forth like that and
[49:55] great congregations and classes in
[49:57] society when the little old church is
[50:00] still down yonder
[50:03] now i like that one
[50:06] even though all that's going on what's
[50:07] happening little old church is still
[50:09] down yonder being born again in a mess
[50:12] like any birth is
[50:15] still paying the price
[50:17] still getting down and dying out acting
[50:19] the same way
[50:23] it's in this day
[50:24] all right go ahead to the next one
[50:29] mark of the beast on today and the seal
[50:32] of god is the holy spirit to reject it
[50:34] is the mark of the beast ever who sees
[50:37] the holy ghost
[50:39] that you're supposed to receive it
[50:42] and don't do it automatically you take
[50:45] the mark of the beast
[50:50] and see how easy
[50:53] if you don't have the baptism of the
[50:55] holy ghost today you've got the mark of
[50:57] the beast no i ain't got the mark of the
[50:59] beast on me boy i tell you what no you
[51:01] don't even know what the mark of the
[51:02] beast is
[51:03] he just told you
[51:08] the mark of the beast is to reject the
[51:10] baptism of the holy ghost
[51:13] there ain't no stamps and this idea is
[51:15] that ideas come on
[51:17] automatically you'll take the mark of
[51:18] the beast because there's only two
[51:19] classes to exist right okay go ahead
[51:23] 14. therefore there are uniting they are
[51:26] uniting themselves now and your pastor
[51:29] here and many can tell you that's
[51:31] reading that they are how the
[51:33] economical movement of the world and
[51:37] then there's a lutheran minister over it
[51:40] that if there there comes a disaster
[51:43] would happen in this neighborhood here
[51:46] if we are not united with that
[51:48] economical move then our churches can no
[51:51] more be churchy no more be church
[51:53] and they can use it for our storehouse
[51:56] or if one of us brothers would see
[51:59] somebody dying or hurt and try to
[52:01] minister to him any spiritual blessings
[52:05] we could be shot
[52:07] for it exactly right
[52:10] we could be given 10 years
[52:13] in federal prison
[52:15] to ministering to the sick
[52:22] i think that's in where we're at so go
[52:23] ahead and roll
[52:24] what are we on fifteen okay
[52:27] and he's talking about the kings of the
[52:28] earth so roll it on that door
[52:30] wine and what it is and all scarlet in
[52:32] the bible represents royals or color
[52:35] scarlet means red
[52:36] and beast represents power did you
[52:39] notice the beast come up out of the sea
[52:42] that was in the revelations the 13th and
[52:46] when you see the beast
[52:48] coming up out of the sea
[52:50] it's meant that this power was raising
[52:54] up among the people
[52:56] okay now listen
[52:57] but in revelation 13
[53:01] when this lamb came up he came up out of
[53:03] the earth no people
[53:05] united states that was the whole thing
[53:07] but then after he had
[53:09] two little horns civil and
[53:11] ecclesiastical power and then he
[53:13] received power and spoke of like a
[53:15] dragon did before you just got to mark
[53:18] it down we are coming into a religious
[53:20] persecution with the same thing
[53:24] that they did in pagan rome many years
[53:27] ago for it's thus saith the lord
[53:31] okay
[53:32] now what's it settling
[53:34] upon a beast of power
[53:37] okay
[53:38] now look at the next one and then we'll
[53:39] try to get to our thought
[53:41] for the time
[53:42] all right
[53:44] because this is there is a man here that
[53:45] can turn on the lives 1963. now they
[53:48] we're on this 91 this is one right for
[53:51] that cause it's a cult
[53:53] we're going to close up
[53:55] you have to be one of them or not you're
[53:57] either in that or you can't do nothing
[54:00] can't even buy or sell that's it
[54:03] you're dyson to pay for the pray for the
[54:05] sick and if you're caught ministering to
[54:07] any of the sick or any person with any
[54:10] script
[54:10] script spiritual thing in there
[54:13] you're subject to a federal law to be
[54:16] executed that's exactly right the you
[54:19] know that that's right it's in their
[54:21] papers yes sir
[54:23] and you cannot do it you have to be
[54:26] to be to belong to the cult
[54:31] you have to belong to the cult
[54:35] now cult is anything that's not a
[54:37] accepted practice
[54:39] there ain't no accepted practice of what
[54:40] they're doing
[54:42] all right roll it on up on to get this
[54:43] next one then we'll just preach for a
[54:45] minute
[54:46] off the message the statue of perfect
[54:48] man
[54:49] see how that deceit
[54:51] what they're trying to do
[54:53] give money away
[54:54] to buy one
[54:56] they're trying to break it
[54:59] and then that's something that you think
[55:00] about what he's talking about he's
[55:01] talking about we
[55:03] we're friends
[55:05] now now where you
[55:07] think with me i know i'm carnal but
[55:08] think with me we think that china
[55:12] brought up something of this or had
[55:14] something to do with this virus
[55:18] did they stop buying from china
[55:24] you know that china's in charge of most
[55:25] of his medication
[55:31] now why didn't they immediately if they
[55:33] could stop every airplane in the iron 45
[55:35] minutes
[55:38] why didn't trump as quick as that happen
[55:42] say
[55:43] and cut off all connections to china
[55:46] no
[55:50] even though you think that's your crook
[55:51] he's the one that pulled the plug he's
[55:52] the one that blowed us up
[55:55] it's just not
[55:57] there's something else behind this thing
[55:59] more than what you're thinking
[56:02] somebody's behind it not not what you're
[56:04] looking at
[56:05] you see
[56:06] they're trying to break it's on the gold
[56:08] standard and the catholic church the
[56:09] hierarchy owns the gold of the world
[56:11] someone says
[56:14] 168 billion dollars 168 billion there
[56:18] you are throw her right back on the gold
[56:20] standard and you people
[56:23] just keep your homes
[56:25] and things but you belong
[56:28] to the catholic church
[56:30] the nation
[56:31] belongs to the catholic church right
[56:35] now you can argue with him
[56:36] that's what i said you know what really
[56:38] to me and i'm so sorry and ashamed of
[56:40] the fact of doing it but you realize
[56:42] that when you expose error
[56:44] that people are going to make a choice
[56:50] they'll make a choice
[56:51] when you expose error people will make a
[56:53] choice
[56:56] and they'll say i don't agree with you
[56:59] well if you don't agree what i just read
[57:00] then you're saying you don't agree with
[57:01] brother brown oh i agree what he said
[57:04] well he just said
[57:08] those are right back on the gold
[57:09] standard
[57:12] now the gold standard is the only thing
[57:13] that gold is on things acceptable for
[57:16] paying debts
[57:18] you know what i'm talking about
[57:20] you don't pay debts with
[57:22] with money you pay debts with backing of
[57:24] whether you got the gold or not
[57:26] all right now for a few minutes i want
[57:28] to take that thought
[57:30] brother random emphatically i've got
[57:32] them if you want them you'll be glad to
[57:33] give them to you or you're talking about
[57:35] that
[57:38] the catholic church
[57:41] will pay off the national debt
[57:44] well that's where i had my ideas set
[57:46] more on and they still are i'll get to
[57:48] that
[57:49] of the church and the catholic church
[57:51] paying debts
[57:53] no
[57:56] it's the national debt of the entire
[57:58] world that's being concerned right now
[58:00] not where the catholic is going to give
[58:02] us we don't need no money for catholic
[58:04] churches
[58:08] but now listen for a minute
[58:11] because you wind up and sell your
[58:13] birthright
[58:15] by falling after the gold
[58:18] the jews
[58:19] have the stocks and bonds
[58:23] all right now they have gold and all
[58:25] don't miss
[58:26] just get the profit what he's saying but
[58:29] rome has the gold
[58:32] it's not rome as a nation of rome
[58:37] right
[58:38] it's kind of funny that that little
[58:40] place over there called the vatican is
[58:42] not even a nation
[58:46] it's a nation of its own self
[58:54] but now listen
[58:57] one of these days we know the bible says
[59:00] that there'll be a covenant made between
[59:02] the
[59:02] jews
[59:04] and the antichrist
[59:07] all right
[59:08] they're going to pay off the national
[59:10] debt
[59:12] well
[59:13] you've heard him tell it over and over
[59:14] he said you thank them to back accompany
[59:16] people and it's that and the others
[59:18] going to wind up and and uh
[59:21] do away with the monies and this and the
[59:22] other or do it a sensible way like
[59:24] castro did he come in done away with
[59:26] everything took in the bonds burned him
[59:28] and done all kind of thing made new
[59:29] money and started it over
[59:31] he said you think they're going to do it
[59:32] here he said no
[59:36] they're not going to do that here
[59:38] he said because these brown and tobacco
[59:39] companies own too many millions of
[59:41] dollars and they're not going to do it
[59:43] so what's it going to do
[59:46] they're going to pay off our national
[59:47] debt
[59:48] national debt not of the church
[59:54] i hope that clicks in you because maybe
[59:55] it would i know listen i got a little
[59:57] sense i know they pay the national debt
[1:00:00] but i always looked in that national
[1:00:02] debt and i'm still looking at it suppose
[1:00:04] we'll get to that in a second
[1:00:06] there is a connection in the national
[1:00:08] debt because if they pay off our
[1:00:10] national debt
[1:00:14] then we don't owe nothing
[1:00:17] because church is going to be great we
[1:00:18] don't know nothing
[1:00:20] this would be automatic to be in the
[1:00:21] church
[1:00:22] but my point was just looking at it like
[1:00:24] they're going to pay off a church is
[1:00:25] dead churches don't have any debt
[1:00:30] it's the world system
[1:00:34] and who controls the world system
[1:00:38] i don't have to worry about the
[1:00:41] government getting an anti-trust suit
[1:00:43] against me
[1:00:45] how about you donnie uh are you
[1:00:48] you think they better be careful what
[1:00:49] they're doing because they you've got
[1:00:50] more money than they got oh no no you
[1:00:53] say well that's silly
[1:00:55] that's true
[1:00:57] instead of you getting your eyes on one
[1:00:59] man as the pope as this whole thing has
[1:01:01] taken place why don't you get your eyes
[1:01:02] on a system
[1:01:07] a system that has everything set to
[1:01:09] where they can pay it off
[1:01:12] and now i wouldn't name the guys but you
[1:01:14] know what i'm talking about take the
[1:01:15] illuminati
[1:01:16] you go home and get this what you call
[1:01:18] it we a thing of fortune they have 400
[1:01:21] 500 billionaires
[1:01:24] and you know what's so funny to me when
[1:01:26] it happened
[1:01:27] i read this one day in the paper and i
[1:01:29] said or not it's dying laughing
[1:01:31] this is a few years ago when russia went
[1:01:33] fail
[1:01:34] you know that there's more billionaires
[1:01:35] in russia now in the united states now
[1:01:38] that was according to the news when
[1:01:39] russia went down
[1:01:42] there's more billionaires in russia
[1:01:44] putin
[1:01:46] has his own hundred airplanes
[1:01:48] he's got his own army
[1:01:54] those people are filthy rich we think of
[1:01:56] them as pulpers
[1:01:58] no
[1:02:00] think of your super rich you name them
[1:02:02] in your mind without having a name put
[1:02:03] it on tape or does that and you'd get
[1:02:05] this one wrong this and this and my dad
[1:02:06] and it's done that hasn't done that and
[1:02:08] you got what
[1:02:10] 50 we'll call it as a number
[1:02:12] of people who have
[1:02:15] hundreds of billions of dollars
[1:02:19] in assets
[1:02:21] which are backed by bonds are money won
[1:02:25] i mean it all's got to be backed by
[1:02:26] bonds
[1:02:28] because that's lifts you apart but then
[1:02:29] you do away with the bonds
[1:02:34] what are you saying
[1:02:36] we better be looking for who the big guy
[1:02:38] is instead of fooling with a little
[1:02:39] puppy dog
[1:02:42] because the little puppy dog he might
[1:02:44] bite you in the heels
[1:02:46] but the guy that's got to control
[1:02:53] you mean they can tell you you can't
[1:02:55] sell toilet paper
[1:03:00] they can tell you that
[1:03:03] this that or the other
[1:03:06] but it's the national debt
[1:03:09] that we owe
[1:03:12] not just the national debt of america
[1:03:15] that's the part we're concerned with
[1:03:18] the national debt of the entire world
[1:03:21] that's on the gold standard
[1:03:25] like i said two or three times isn't it
[1:03:27] odd all of this virus is struck all over
[1:03:29] the world
[1:03:32] the national economy is going down
[1:03:34] because all over the world every nation
[1:03:36] is failing
[1:03:38] let it keep rolling for a little while
[1:03:41] how many trillions have we borrowed
[1:03:43] since
[1:03:44] they started the virus
[1:03:48] you realize what a trillion is
[1:03:51] i can't think that way
[1:03:56] how many billions it takes to make a
[1:03:58] trillion
[1:03:59] a hundred billion to make a trillion or
[1:04:01] something
[1:04:03] somebody give me numbers
[1:04:05] that's
[1:04:06] but anyhow trillion is higher
[1:04:10] okay one thousand
[1:04:13] one thousand billion one thousand
[1:04:15] billion anyway
[1:04:18] my goodness
[1:04:21] and they've already borrowed what we
[1:04:23] already had before this started we were
[1:04:25] already 10 or 13 i remember enough
[1:04:29] 17 trillion was already our national
[1:04:32] debt before anything started
[1:04:34] now they've added we'll say another 10
[1:04:37] trillion this is a number
[1:04:40] how in the world are you going to pay
[1:04:41] that off
[1:04:42] it's the prime time for the antichrist
[1:04:45] to step in now amen
[1:04:49] and take over
[1:04:51] and pay off our national debt well all
[1:04:53] right now
[1:04:57] that's who you belong to
[1:05:01] they what you want to
[1:05:03] i'll tell you what i'm i'm missing i'm
[1:05:05] my own man i'm
[1:05:07] that's okay
[1:05:09] but if you can't buy a roll of toilet
[1:05:11] paper you order to learn a little bit
[1:05:13] and i don't make that as a joke i just
[1:05:15] make it it's so silly it's because
[1:05:17] something happened
[1:05:19] somebody wound up with toilet paper
[1:05:22] involved
[1:05:27] well what if you owned all the toilet
[1:05:28] paper
[1:05:30] on there and what would you do if you
[1:05:31] owned all the toilet paper i just raised
[1:05:33] the price of toilet paper and then i'd
[1:05:34] be an instant trillionaire and
[1:05:36] billionaires
[1:05:39] i'm just making a point
[1:05:42] forgive me taking a little time to just
[1:05:44] talk to you about it
[1:05:46] we're sitting in the worst depression
[1:05:48] that has ever been
[1:05:50] when any move whatsoever now determines
[1:05:53] whether we exist another month
[1:05:58] you think you're going to take away this
[1:06:00] thing now that you've already said in
[1:06:01] the mind of the people
[1:06:03] that if they get sick they just got to
[1:06:05] tell their boss
[1:06:07] i don't feel good he says well go home
[1:06:10] government will pay your pay
[1:06:12] they go home get paid
[1:06:16] what's going to happen if they stop that
[1:06:24] or old people going to have no way to go
[1:06:30] they've got us right where they want it
[1:06:31] this is the end the beginning of the end
[1:06:36] they can call in anything they want to
[1:06:39] it doesn't matter what you've got in the
[1:06:40] bank
[1:06:43] i'll show you one in here where brother
[1:06:44] brown says they have the paper
[1:06:48] he's talking about the the bonds and the
[1:06:50] and the the cash and he said and they
[1:06:52] have the paper
[1:06:54] that they can change the money
[1:06:56] well that guy out of texas they asked
[1:06:58] him
[1:06:59] one day he asked a fellow big man and
[1:07:02] said
[1:07:03] they're talking about changing the
[1:07:05] plastic you know going to credit cards
[1:07:07] right
[1:07:08] he said how long would that take to
[1:07:09] enact he said overnight
[1:07:17] you got a pocket full of money
[1:07:19] you got ten thousand dollars in your hip
[1:07:21] pocket and mud i'll tell you that's what
[1:07:23] tom was i ain't throwing on him because
[1:07:24] he didn't gone
[1:07:26] but uh he talking about like a man that
[1:07:28] guilt they asked him one day he was
[1:07:31] selling his son was
[1:07:32] was uh
[1:07:34] paying somebody for buying a house
[1:07:36] and the son couldn't the bank wouldn't
[1:07:37] let him have the money instantly and you
[1:07:39] know the daddy looked over at those
[1:07:41] shorty standards and then was
[1:07:43] he looked over at him and said daddy you
[1:07:44] got any money he said how much is it
[1:07:48] a lot of money then about thirteen
[1:07:50] thousand dollars he just pulled out his
[1:07:51] billfold you know and just laid out the
[1:07:53] money you know
[1:07:55] he had it with him you know
[1:07:57] you think you got that
[1:07:59] all they got to declare
[1:08:01] you remember here a few months ago when
[1:08:03] that one of those big guys overseas in
[1:08:05] the church
[1:08:08] they called in all of that money
[1:08:10] and we'll say 100 bills they called it
[1:08:12] in he brought in millions that he had
[1:08:14] stored up
[1:08:16] and had them just sitting in a room
[1:08:18] millions of dollars they took every one
[1:08:20] of
[1:08:22] them was nothing they could do
[1:08:26] well they can't get my money
[1:08:31] well
[1:08:32] i don't believe in burning it but it'd
[1:08:34] probably be a good thing to do
[1:08:36] you know
[1:08:39] i'm just trying to be straight to get
[1:08:41] you to think one thing about what's
[1:08:42] going on today
[1:08:44] the world today is in the very primest
[1:08:47] time that it could have ever been for
[1:08:49] the antichrist to take over and pay off
[1:08:52] the debts and pay off the thing they pay
[1:08:54] our national debts off and when they do
[1:08:56] we belong to them
[1:08:59] and you can't buy or sell without having
[1:09:01] their
[1:09:03] card
[1:09:04] it's stones
[1:09:06] but we'll just fight
[1:09:08] fight what
[1:09:15] come on
[1:09:17] all over the whole world
[1:09:25] not just one country
[1:09:27] in troubles all over the whole world
[1:09:31] come on musician
[1:09:33] think on these things
[1:09:35] they have the gold
[1:09:38] they have the bonds
[1:09:40] the contract between the antichrist and
[1:09:42] the jews
[1:09:43] will not be seen i'm quoting brother
[1:09:45] branham will not be seen by the bride of
[1:09:48] jesus christ i'm glad for that i believe
[1:09:51] that
[1:09:52] all right but it don't mean it can't be
[1:09:54] made
[1:09:56] or set in order
[1:09:58] then
[1:09:59] because i did learn a little bit tony
[1:10:01] and us could tell you a little bit about
[1:10:02] general motors when they
[1:10:05] they come in and they voted in a new
[1:10:06] contract
[1:10:09] that was not we get on the news and
[1:10:10] they'd say oh general motors and
[1:10:13] them has reached an agreement on the
[1:10:15] contract they got a contract
[1:10:21] you don't have a contract until you've
[1:10:22] got to rank and file
[1:10:25] rank and file voted the contract to
[1:10:26] accept it or reject it if they rejected
[1:10:29] that contract they went back and started
[1:10:30] contracting again
[1:10:33] they
[1:10:35] what are you saying
[1:10:37] they can do what they want to
[1:10:40] and ain't nothing you can do
[1:10:43] well i'll just get me a gun and i'll go
[1:10:44] out here help yourself
[1:10:47] we'll see you down to jail
[1:10:49] if you live
[1:10:52] well what are you going to do
[1:10:54] i'll find that quote in there and i'll
[1:10:56] give it back to you we're running around
[1:10:57] and says you'll meet in homes
[1:11:02] you're meeting old store buildings in
[1:11:04] places
[1:11:06] but you won't be telling nobody you're
[1:11:08] going to have a meeting
[1:11:11] because you don't dare do that
[1:11:14] you say yeah but we can't travel
[1:11:16] no but we may be able to get together
[1:11:18] where we're at
[1:11:20] we will serve god if you understand what
[1:11:22] i mean all of these things is not
[1:11:24] bringing me to a down and out situation
[1:11:26] it's bringing me to a place of
[1:11:27] understanding one thing when the enemy
[1:11:30] comes in like a flood the spirit of the
[1:11:31] lord will raise up a standard because
[1:11:33] when that happens out there and all
[1:11:35] those things start pounding on us in the
[1:11:36] wrong way god will move on the scene
[1:11:39] i'm in there i'm in that point on stay
[1:11:41] in that point he will always take care
[1:11:43] of his people
[1:11:45] you don't have to worry about it
[1:11:46] if you're hungry just speak it
[1:11:49] you don't have to worry about it
[1:11:52] all of that is in order
[1:11:54] amen
[1:11:57] think on these things
[1:11:59] maybe i've been slamming around all day
[1:12:01] long enough for you to get something out
[1:12:03] of it
[1:12:06] but i'm looking for the greatest revival
[1:12:08] that has ever been in the world
[1:12:11] because if you understand why i keep
[1:12:13] emphasizing
[1:12:14] the whole world is in a depression well
[1:12:16] you know what
[1:12:18] the little bride is around the world
[1:12:22] maybe little groups here little groups
[1:12:24] are around the world
[1:12:27] little people down here in this place
[1:12:28] little people there
[1:12:31] serving god
[1:12:33] she ain't forsaken
[1:12:38] he's going up
[1:12:39] let's stand father
[1:12:41] we've tried to make it plain and i know
[1:12:43] we're just sorry
[1:12:46] but you take it and you make it plain
[1:12:50] we're not doomsdays
[1:12:52] we're honoring glory your name because
[1:12:54] you've told us what'll take place
[1:12:56] we know what to look for
[1:12:58] we know to know and to realize that
[1:13:00] you'll be right there when we have need
[1:13:02] of
[1:13:03] we don't have to worry about it
[1:13:05] because you always are it may look bad
[1:13:08] it may look horrible
[1:13:10] but yet who worries about what it looks
[1:13:11] like is what you are what you've said we
[1:13:14] love you and we thank you be with the
[1:13:15] people on the way home and said lord
[1:13:17] consider these things and just let it be
[1:13:19] in their mind and thinking
[1:13:21] lord we're trying to get one thing
[1:13:25] send the persecution
[1:13:28] because
[1:13:29] there'll be a revival
[1:13:31] follower thereafter
[1:13:33] and we love you and we thank you
[1:13:35] in jesus name
[1:13:37] and listen
[1:13:38] what we got
[1:13:41] that sounds like home
[1:13:44] to me
[1:13:47] like where i
[1:13:50] want to be
[1:13:56] [Music]
[1:14:09] for persecution
[1:14:11] [Music]

[1:14:27] that word
[1:14:28] [Music]
[1:14:37] back where i was are you worried
[1:14:42] [Music]
[1:14:50] we're not thinking about coming 50 years
[1:14:54] of studying one prophet's message
[1:14:58] with
[1:14:59] the story
[1:15:00] you say yeah but you got conjured up
[1:15:02] show me come on
[1:15:04] i'll at least do that you come and show
[1:15:07] me the contradictions in this message

[1:17:03] i can know that you have everything in
[1:17:05] charge
