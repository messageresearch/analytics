[46:47] honest testimony because i watched him
[46:49] for the rest of the day and he was just
[46:51] like a young he'd been about 50 i think

[46:56] watched him for the rest of the day and
[46:58] he was serving everybody and smiling and
[47:01] going on and halloween and all the rest
[47:04] today and i stopped him at one one stage
[47:06] and i said tell me i said how's your
[47:08] peace

[47:30] them to the lord amen and you just go on
[47:32] your way it's just so wonderful so
[47:34] wonderful praise the lord and this year
[47:36] we also went over that was november and
[47:39] this year we went over to uh to thailand
[47:42] and vietnam and there's a couple of
[47:45] people that
[47:46] really come to hear me in thailand and
[47:48] then they go off again and wander off
[47:50] but this year when they came amen i
[47:53] don't think they maybe really expected
[47:55] to but the holy spirit got a real hold
[47:57] of them and so we ended up baptizing
[48:00] eight people in thailand this year here
[48:02] people thai souls hit people amen i
[48:05] can't some of them can speak my language
[48:06] and some of them can
[48:08] and it was it was wonderful praise the
[48:10] lord i just told my soul it amen a new
[48:13] beginning amen and so that was wonderful
[48:16] and also we used
[48:18] the money that with the moneys that
[48:20] we've got amen
[48:22] uh so to buy the food
[48:25] everywhere we go
[48:26] in india everywhere we go when we go up
[48:29] into the hills or something like that
[48:30] not to a rich church now some churches
[48:32] can take care of themselves um but you
[48:35] know when you go into the poor places we
[48:37] always buy them rice and good rice hey
[48:40] man i believe god does things good and
[48:42] those things
[48:44] and uh not just old scrappy stuff just
[48:46] good the best you can get
[48:48] and uh we leave it with the purse amen
[48:51] and to help them and so we did that in
[48:53] thailand as well and it was i just
[48:56] rejoice in it you know and sometimes you
[48:58] know you'd be watching a whole church
[49:00] like if we were all fed later on and you
[49:02] were all sitting around and a big again
[49:04] and all the rest is getting served out
[49:06] to you and you're eating it all the way
[49:08] in the end you know and they're happy so
[49:10] if you're happy they're happy and i'm
[49:11] happy
[49:12] and the lord's helping sure
[49:15] wonderful and we went on down to vietnam
[49:18] and we had another wonderful time all
[49:21] there was about 25 pastors there and i
[49:24] love it because when they go back even
[49:26] they're going to tell what they've heard
[49:28] they're going to tell what they've heard
[49:30] amen and i'm marvelous i'm getting to
[49:32] know some of them well and so we had
[49:35] three days of good teaching with them
[49:36] pastors amen and all the funds fed them
[49:40] i
[49:40] paid for their petrols and whatnot and
[49:42] their bus first some of them and someone
[49:44] won their motorcycles uh so it was
[49:46] wonderful that's where it all goes you
[49:48] know
[49:49] and then
[49:50] we went off to see one of the young
[49:52] pastors that was there and we went off
[49:54] to his little church he started six
[49:56] months prior and
[49:59] it was wonderful that day it was two
[50:01] hours on a motorbike now i have hit my
[50:03] 64th year
[50:07] two hours on the motorbike behind you
[50:09] know
[50:10] and i've had
[50:13] but the lord gave us the strength and we
[50:16] stopped off this lovely sunny day and
[50:17] the lord gave us a strength and we
[50:19] stopped off uh uh you know and so to
[50:22] have some refreshments and then we got
[50:24] to the police
[50:25] and
[50:26] they had to when we got to this place
[50:28] the pastor was there but when i got out
[50:30] of the bus the first thing they did was
[50:32] they gave me or sorry not the bus um
[50:35] uh we had to go by bus to this place
[50:38] and uh when we got off we had to get all
[50:41] the motorbike stuff on with a mask
[50:45] and and radar like that there and they
[50:47] gave me one of their jackets these
[50:49] vietnamese jackets so that would be
[50:51] disguised now i'm
[50:53] this morning
[50:55] i forgot to put my wife because of
[50:56] what's happened you know forgot to fill
[50:58] my wife forgot to bring the photographs
[51:01] i'm so sorry
[51:02] but about that i would love you to see
[51:04] them but i want to show them to your
[51:05] pastor and the stem few and uh anyway
[51:08] you wouldn't recognize it's me and
[51:10] somebody said what did you do with your
[51:11] hands i said i made sure my hands was
[51:12] like that
[51:13] so so nobody they could they really
[51:15] didn't want they didn't want any of the
[51:17] authorities of the place there's a big
[51:18] army camp and plenty of activity
[51:21] and they didn't want they didn't want
[51:22] them to know that i was there as a white
[51:24] man so that was fine and then we got
[51:26] into a little village away off the main
[51:28] road so nobody cared very much then and
[51:30] i could take it off and preach and that
[51:33] there's about 15 16 people there but
[51:35] about seven of them came to the lord
[51:37] amen
[51:38] accepted the lord so obviously we just
[51:40] weren't going to baptize them right away
[51:42] but that young man will do it and god
[51:44] love him he had a corrugated iron house
[51:46] maybe from that wall to where i am about
[51:49] that that long that's that's what he's
[51:50] got him in his wagon his little child
[51:52] and the little fella was out there with
[51:53] his uh little uh tricycle good running
[51:56] around there was all these trees with
[51:58] that oh uh what is it the rubber rubber
[52:00] trees that's the break in the middle and
[52:02] that little place and uh they don't have
[52:04] much i laid down on their wooden bed i
[52:06] was tired and i laid down on their
[52:08] wooden bed but what a wonderful time
[52:10] what a wonderful time it was and back
[52:12] back in saigon we had seen the hub
[52:15] last
[52:16] year when uh i was talking to brother
[52:19] joe there at the back and we got talking
[52:21] about that when i went home i thought
[52:23] you know that would be a wonderful thing
[52:24] to do and just coming up to one trip to
[52:27] go to india and spending all this money
[52:30] on a hub machine i thought oh that's
[52:32] going to be tight
[52:33] right but you know god provides he
[52:34] really does provide and so um i knew
[52:38] that the price of it and the taxes and
[52:40] all and to buy it and you know we don't
[52:42] send books over to vietnam we let them
[52:43] print their own books now
[52:45] and so that's a thrill of my heart
[52:47] that's a joy you couldn't imagine how
[52:49] much joy i've got in my heart to see
[52:51] this message that we love printed in
[52:54] vietnamese amen i know they've done it
[52:56] up in vancouver and all that that's fine
[52:58] but these guys have got it now they can

[53:02] more uh paper and an ink and and they're
[53:05] printing it in in vietnamese you
[53:07] wouldn't understand a word of it but
[53:08] it's been all and he said it's good
[53:10] translation so thank god for that and it

[53:22] his little baby as well uh that was a
[53:24] wonderful thing

[1:02:09] table amen but that was lit that you
[1:02:12] could have light hallelujah even the
[1:02:14] high priest that he could see his way
[1:02:16] into the holy holy spirit amen so uh
[1:02:19] amen and of course as i said it was
[1:02:21] based on the fashion of the original and
[1:02:24] the tabernacle uh in exodus 25 if you
[1:02:27] want to note it verse 30 uh 39 31 to 39
[1:02:31] extremes of all and uh the lovely thing
[1:02:34] to note about it is this that it was a
[1:02:36] heavenly origin amen this was not
[1:02:39] thought of in man's head this came down
[1:02:41] from from god i'm glory amen and that's
[1:02:44] a wonderful thing praise the lord and it
[1:02:47] was pure gold and moses because all the
[1:02:50] other ones were based on moses one in
[1:02:52] the tabernacle and you run them and
[1:02:53] compare them uh and so um like uh if you
[1:02:58] just look at the tabernacle was a a
[1:03:00] desert floor they never had any flooring
[1:03:02] in the tabernacle but the temple did
[1:03:04] amen and of course it was covered in
[1:03:06] gold amen and it's symbolic that it's
[1:03:09] the church you're talking about in the
[1:03:10] temple and we will walk the streets of
[1:03:12] gold one day amen but here in the
[1:03:14] tabernacle on an earthly journey you're
[1:03:16] you know and that's what the man said
[1:03:18] some people are so heavenly minded that
[1:03:20] they're no earthly good all right so so
[1:03:21] you want to keep your feet on the ground
[1:03:24] all right nine praise the lord but it
[1:03:26] was pure gold amen and it was it spoke
[1:03:29] of christ the deity of christ pure gold
[1:03:31] absolutely the light of the world
[1:03:34] hallelujah and we know that i could give
[1:03:36] you more illustrations and take me to
[1:03:37] anoint me that i've talked to people
[1:03:39] muslims and i've talked to hindus and
[1:03:41] i've talked to all kinds of people
[1:03:42] showing them uh that they're too lit
[1:03:45] that we've got the message of the honor
[1:03:47] vindicated hallelujah
[1:03:49] feels amen he can't open anybody's eyes
[1:03:52] but jesus christ time amen
[1:03:54] hallelujah and that's the kind of thing
[1:03:56] i can say folks if i met somebody
[1:03:59] and i do meet people like that and i've
[1:04:01] seen these uh humans happen brother wait
[1:04:03] i can say then please you explain to me
[1:04:05] who did that exactly right who did that
[1:04:07] hallelujah
[1:04:09] amen see so amen here he is he's the
[1:04:12] light of the world the light of god amen
[1:04:14] and brother brother said life is the
[1:04:16] revealed word of god amen he said i'd
[1:04:18] say to that there is no light so he is
[1:04:20] the light of the revealed word of god
[1:04:22] that's what he is today amen and it was
[1:04:25] a pure amen
[1:04:27] amen
[1:04:28] a pure white light amen there was no sin
[1:04:31] or no impurity and him he was
[1:04:34] incorruptable that flesh amen never
[1:04:36] corrupted is that right right certain it
[1:04:38] is hallelujah and the light of the glory
[1:04:42] the shekinah of god
[1:04:44] was seen in the face of jesus christ
[1:04:47] amen so wonderful and it was a beating
[1:04:49] work amen it had to be molded and beaten
[1:04:53] and worked out amen and it speaks of the
[1:04:55] sufferings of christ honest church as
[1:04:57] you go into these these lamps same
[1:04:59] analogy i'll just go through it very
[1:05:02] soon this is just a background actually
[1:05:04] amen trying to get you up to your
[1:05:05] crescendo amen and uh praise the lord it
[1:05:08] was made of one piece of pure gold i
[1:05:11] remember robbie richie was saying that
[1:05:12] the one they i think the one they have
[1:05:14] nine
[1:05:15] is a gold plated but he said it is their
[1:05:18] desire that one day they will actually
[1:05:22] uh have a pure gold menorah okay all
[1:05:24] right principle we've got a pure gold
[1:05:26] menorah
[1:05:27] hallelujah amen
[1:05:29] uh dr uh zeon and we call it the zion
[1:05:33] but they call it the jews call it zeon
[1:05:34] when dr zeon every went back to israel
[1:05:38] he said i i pray for you at the western
[1:05:41] wall and he's the apostle of ireland i
[1:05:43] need to finish this tour and i said
[1:05:45] that's fine i said
[1:05:47] thank you very much and i said we'll
[1:05:58] amen one piece of pure gold speaking of
[1:06:01] the unity of christ and his church
[1:06:04] hallelujah that we're part of that amen
[1:06:06] we're going to show you that right now
[1:06:08] because you know uh the brother branham
[1:06:11] always taught us that no scriptures have
[1:06:13] any private interpretation amen but when
[1:06:15] it interprets itself god is his own
[1:06:17] interpreter and the the lovely thing
[1:06:20] about this is that he interprets it for
[1:06:22] us doesn't it amen and you just get it
[1:06:24] have you turned with me here i just in
[1:06:26] the very book of revelation one
[1:06:28] praise the lord and there he was in the
[1:06:30] midst of the seven candlesticks one leg
[1:06:33] unto the son of man clover the garment
[1:06:35] see and so write these things in verse
[1:06:38] 19 chapter one and what i have seen and
[1:06:41] the things that shall be hereafter and
[1:06:43] he said the mystery of the seven stars
[1:06:46] amen and we've got it they're not so
[1:06:47] little obscure uh things that are right
[1:06:50] in the right hand of jesus christ
[1:06:51] hallelujah and they're there and he says
[1:06:55] which thy source in the right hand
[1:06:57] that's the power and authority it says
[1:07:00] are the seven golden candlesticks the
[1:07:02] seven stars are the angels or the
[1:07:05] messengers
[1:07:06] of the seven churches and the seven
[1:07:08] candlesticks which thou sourced are the
[1:07:11] seven churches amen so each each part of
[1:07:14] that there would speak of
[1:07:17] each of the seven church teachers amen
[1:07:19] praise the lord that's wonderful amen
[1:07:21] and uh praise god a seven branch lamb
[1:07:24] stand because that's really what it was
[1:07:26] amen and you know that's what they
[1:07:29] represent and uh
[1:07:32] jesus said ye are the light of the world
[1:07:33] right praise god so we gotta let her
[1:07:35] shine you know let's let's
[1:07:38] never be ashamed praise god of people
[1:07:41] knowing that you're a christian amen
[1:07:43] you come around my area and people that
[1:07:45] know me you ask him am i a christian and
[1:07:47] let them answer the question for you
[1:07:49] matter of fact i'll give you a one
[1:07:50] little illustration you know uh we've
[1:07:52] got a couple of dogs that only keep
[1:07:54] golden retrievers but i we keep a few
[1:07:57] and we love them all we love doing the
[1:07:58] best you know and uh
[1:08:00] they usually miss me when i'm away but
[1:08:02] the thing is that uh i my boss came on
[1:08:05] the phone and i was answering the phone
[1:08:07] and of course the dogs had heard the
[1:08:09] phone ringing so they have to chirp up
[1:08:11] and they're all parking their heads up
[1:08:13] they're doing that they're barking about
[1:08:14] it but they're all bargaining
[1:08:16] and i i so i said be quiet you know the
[1:08:19] word listening they're still barking i'm
[1:08:20] saying excuse me excuse me and i said
[1:08:23] shut up
[1:08:26] well you know what that's a language
[1:08:28] understand
[1:08:30] you know so i i went back on the phone
[1:08:32] brother
[1:08:33] my boss says charge
[1:08:35] and i said yes
[1:08:36] she said that's the first time i've
[1:08:38] heard you raise your voice in nine years
[1:08:44] and actually my dog will understand you
[1:08:46] you say go home go home and just look up
[1:08:48] you know he's like go home
[1:08:50] get
[1:08:56] you know brother branham said there was
[1:08:58] seven church jesus in the old testament
[1:09:00] often worked it right and i'll tell you
[1:09:02] one thing i'm not gonna do it for you
[1:09:03] this morning because i'm you know i'm
[1:09:05] just not going to do it but if there's
[1:09:06] seven churches there have to be seven
[1:09:07] churches messengers
[1:09:09] amen i think truly and when i thought
[1:09:11] about it i'm not gonna go to the night
[1:09:13] but you know i mean moses moses and paul
[1:09:15] go along so so well because moses wrote
[1:09:18] the first five books and paul wrote the
[1:09:20] the
[1:09:21] two thirds of the new testament or
[1:09:22] whatever it was and uh you know the
[1:09:24] first church messenger we know john the
[1:09:27] baptist uh uh finished it up and we know
[1:09:29] brother branham finished the larger
[1:09:30] change so you can work out the rest for
[1:09:32] yourself
[1:09:36] i'll tell you what i could i could go
[1:09:37] through it and i'll tell you i've got a
[1:09:38] good idea of who them church messengers
[1:09:40] were i just got a little a little dirt
[1:09:43] in my mind you know because elijah uh
[1:09:45] brown said that the the the dark ages
[1:09:48] and the old testament was was right
[1:09:50] there
[1:09:52] under that king ahab amen so anyway
[1:09:54] we'll we'll leave that praise the lord
[1:09:56] and uh just go on but the branches the
[1:09:59] shafts the knots the little balls the
[1:10:01] flowers and the buds each group of three
[1:10:04] and three and three nine and complete
[1:10:07] everything's complete everything speaks
[1:10:09] to you everything is complete amen is
[1:10:11] the most beautiful thank praise the lord
[1:10:13] and the natural amen and uh nine at this
[1:10:16] fruit of the spirit amen completeness
[1:10:19] praise god do not tear fruit of the
[1:10:20] spirit there are nine for the spirit and
[1:10:22] the nine gifts of the spirit amen nine
[1:10:24] gifts also of the spirit meaning
[1:10:26] complete amman is complete praise the
[1:10:29] lord and i've always believed in the
[1:10:31] gifts of the spirit folks because you do
[1:10:33] not go one of the the brother whose wife
[1:10:36] as mother was raised his 12 year old
[1:10:39] girl they were in a village and the
[1:10:41] witch doctor put a curse on her and she
[1:10:43] died at 12 years of age
[1:10:45] and i was able to tell brother timothy
[1:10:47] where she is praise god amen where she
[1:10:50] is today she's in at the opening today
[1:10:52] hallelujah and he was so happy amen to
[1:10:54] know hallelujah that she's under that
[1:10:56] power of fire this morning
[1:10:58] and uh that that is wonderful but you
[1:11:00] know you cannot go to a place like that
[1:11:02] if you're not prepared to meet the devil
[1:11:04] amen and if he's going to go toe to toe
[1:11:06] with you you have to be prepared to to
[1:11:09] take him on amen and we're not afraid to
[1:11:11] do that because creator is he that's in
[1:11:13] us that he that's in the world so if
[1:11:15] you're in a job or something someone's
[1:11:17] getting on your back now why would i say
[1:11:19] that this morning amen you see and
[1:11:22] someone's getting on your back or the
[1:11:23] neighbors being nasty to you or
[1:11:25] something greater is he that is in you
[1:11:27] that he that is in the world praise god
[1:11:30] you just keep going being a christian
[1:11:31] amen and you will get the victory
[1:11:33] hallelujah
[1:11:34] i remember i know i'm not gonna tell you
[1:11:36] i'm gonna tell you one illustration but
[1:11:38] i'll leave that amen and uh praise the
[1:11:40] lord even on the main shaft
[1:11:43] there's four groups of nuts and bolts
[1:11:45] four groups of flowers and buds and
[1:11:47] you've got twelve just even in the main
[1:11:49] stem which speaks of christ when you're
[1:11:51] talking about the rest of the things and
[1:11:53] uh 12 is divine government amen divine
[1:11:56] government you've got the twelve
[1:11:57] apostles of the lamb the twelve trades
[1:11:59] of israel and there was twelve baskets
[1:12:01] full praise alone and it never misses
[1:12:03] brother brother said god's mathematics
[1:12:05] are correct hallelujah and so they are
[1:12:07] amen and it all sings that they were
[1:12:10] they were beasts uh maybe before i don't
[1:12:12] know but but aaron's rod that that the
[1:12:15] buddha amen speaking of the resurrection
[1:12:17] that this seemed to be based on that uh
[1:12:19] that three amen not that almond tree
[1:12:22] whatever it was these were put together
[1:12:24] and this in this shape and form but
[1:12:26] completely beautiful uh i'm sorry these
[1:12:29] are a little bit more than tour but but
[1:12:31] i mean that's beautiful if you want to
[1:12:32] have a look at that later it's so
[1:12:34] beautiful praise god the workmanship
[1:12:37] that that went into it amen and anyway
[1:12:39] let's go on
[1:12:40] praise god that uh uh so and there was
[1:12:43] 66 and all amen and we've got our 66
[1:12:46] books of the bible amen now i praise the
[1:12:49] lord there was three million knots amen
[1:12:51] and the center one and they were
[1:12:53] supported they supported the six
[1:12:56] branches going out amen and of course
[1:12:58] that speaks of us as our own godhead
[1:13:00] amen not not three separate gods but one
[1:13:03] god and three officers amen and of
[1:13:06] course we looked at the lampstands the
[1:13:07] church ages and complete and perfect
[1:13:11] amen the churches are complete and
[1:13:12] perfect jesus is the light of the world
[1:13:14] and number 10
[1:13:16] there was ten lampstands in the temple
[1:13:18] right five down this way five down that
[1:13:20] way amen and uh praise the lord and the
[1:13:24] in the tabernacle there was one just one
[1:13:26] christ but here there was five on each
[1:13:28] side that's ten and that speaks of the
[1:13:30] speaks of the uh
[1:13:32] the the church of jesus christ amen and
[1:13:35] ten in the scripture is the number of
[1:13:37] divine law amen will just
[1:13:40] got it right amen they're not 11 not 12
[1:13:43] there's 10 divine law as in the ten
[1:13:46] commandments as in that ten lepers were
[1:13:48] healed amen the divine lord to heal the
[1:13:51] ten right amen and the disciples with it
[1:13:54] ten days for the coming of the holy
[1:13:56] spirit just after the law comes grace
[1:13:59] and it's also beautiful amen after the
[1:14:02] ascension amen they win at the ten days
[1:14:04] right praise the lord and uh divine law
[1:14:06] and order then grace and of course also
[1:14:09] a ten is the number of responsibility
[1:14:13] and i'm just going to give you a little
[1:14:14] quote out of revelation again in a
[1:14:16] moment but 10 is the number of
[1:14:17] responsibility and we know that because
[1:14:19] it was 10 virgins right amen they were
[1:14:22] responsible they were responsible as we
[1:14:24] often were talking even now over the
[1:14:26] time that god has no grandchildren right
[1:14:29] amen we're all responsible here today
[1:14:31] it's not your mom it's not your god it's
[1:14:33] you hallelujah you've got to meet god
[1:14:35] yourself and the god that i'm talking
[1:14:37] about is a stranger and i'm leaving you
[1:14:39] today you're going to have
[1:14:55] to to to have oil in your room amen
[1:14:57] praise god and then finally amen will
[1:15:01] if you've got ten uh ten uh uh
[1:15:04] candlesticks at all and uh you multiply
[1:15:07] that by seven little branches each
[1:15:08] you've got 70 and and 70 is always in
[1:15:11] the bible the number prior to increase
[1:15:14] amen amen and uh the 70 sons of jacob
[1:15:18] went into egypt amen prior to the
[1:15:20] killing within 70 souls and they come
[1:15:22] out like 2 million or something that's
[1:15:24] what the prophet said and then we know
[1:15:25] that to be true amen and so praise the
[1:15:27] lord there were 70 pounds of elim and
[1:15:30] they were 70 years in exile amen you
[1:15:34] know that jeremiah said you'll be there
[1:15:36] and and that temple amen
[1:15:39] jerusalem fell the temple was destroyed
[1:15:41] 586 amen right bc and because you're
[1:15:44] working backwards it was restarted again
[1:15:47] and in 5 16 amen and if you take that
[1:15:51] just a simple calculation you'll see
[1:15:52] that 70 years right amen and so the the
[1:15:55] mathematics are absolutely pure and true
[1:15:58] nine the improvement of the seven lumps
[1:16:00] that's what it's called when a priest if
[1:16:03] it was my uh a duty to look after the
[1:16:07] candelabra or the menorah uh or the
[1:16:09] menorahs as it was in the temple um amen
[1:16:13] uh i'll show you the position they were
[1:16:15] in a moment but it's called the
[1:16:18] improvement of the lungs so that's
[1:16:20] probably what you'd have been getting
[1:16:22] you know
[1:16:23] next week you'll be on the improvement
[1:16:24] of the lunch you know so praise the lord
[1:16:27] and as a priest we've got to keep the
[1:16:28] improvement of the lambs amen
[1:16:30] and
[1:16:32] of course if you think about the god
[1:16:34] that we know and look at all them the
[1:16:36] stars and space and harborings just
[1:16:39] burning around
[1:16:40] amen and perfect harmony
[1:16:43] you know you see that god is a god of
[1:16:46] harmony and perfection amen and he just
[1:16:49] does not do anything uh like haphazard
[1:16:52] right you know what i mean it's all
[1:16:54] ordered hallelujah by the lord amen and
[1:16:58] the candelabra it was i think it was uh
[1:17:01] it tells you it's eighteen hundredths
[1:17:04] now as someone said to me a home breath
[1:17:05] says four inches and might be but i
[1:17:07] think it may have been a little bit
[1:17:08] bigger than six foot because they had
[1:17:11] three steps of ascension amen praise the
[1:17:15] lord the three steps of attention and uh
[1:17:18] when the in the old testament talks
[1:17:20] about going up to the menorah it meant
[1:17:23] one two three amen so that's the way
[1:17:25] they did it amen and by the priest and
[1:17:28] you are a priest today amen and praise
[1:17:31] the lord you go up amen and you wrote
[1:17:33] eye level with this here amen you're not
[1:17:36] looking down trying to light it like
[1:17:38] that that's the way the catholic priest
[1:17:39] does it but you are laid it amen
[1:17:42] at eye level amen and you clean it all
[1:17:45] at eye level and put in the new uh uh
[1:17:47] things in it at that level amen and so
[1:17:51] amen now let me see here
[1:17:53] praise the lord it says in numbers it
[1:17:55] says aaron we're now lightest alums the
[1:17:58] seven lamps shall give light over the
[1:18:00] menorah on an exodus on you shall make
[1:18:03] the seven lobster off and the light of
[1:18:05] the seven lumps they're off that they
[1:18:07] may light over against it that it may
[1:18:10] shine towards the center no i what i'm
[1:18:13] doing and i'm just building you right up
[1:18:15] here for because i want to bring this
[1:18:17] into the message amen i want to show you
[1:18:19] something that happened to bring it into
[1:18:20] our day and to our edge amen praise the
[1:18:22] lord that's
[1:18:24] amen that my leg toward the center so
[1:18:26] that all lit would give a glorious light
[1:18:29] right across the whole of the holy uh
[1:18:31] place amen and of course we shouldn't
[1:18:34] even have to be told that the oil that
[1:18:36] pure olive oil that was used is a type
[1:18:38] of the holy ghost amen hallelujah and
[1:18:41] you we need your oil every day amen not
[1:18:44] just sunday morning monday morning
[1:18:46] praise god when you go to work when you
[1:18:47] come back from work in the house doing
[1:18:49] your dishes whatever you're doing you
[1:18:50] need the oil hallelujah to keep you
[1:18:52] burning
[1:18:54] amen
[1:18:55] praise god amen
[1:18:58] uh if i may just read this here amen to
[1:19:01] you
[1:19:02] praise god and uh
[1:19:05] i just want you to listen to this and
[1:19:07] you know you will get it praise the lord
[1:19:09] amen now
[1:19:11] the priest here
[1:19:13] when he comes in in the morning time
[1:19:15] and he look up the first thing you do
[1:19:17] look at the candelabra and
[1:19:20] he'll see if anyone have went out okay
[1:19:23] now i'm going to bring in a few little
[1:19:24] things here but he would see a better
[1:19:25] one
[1:19:26] and he just didn't start anywhere this
[1:19:29] was all ordered amen i mean he started
[1:19:32] and i had a fashion and uh so uh he he
[1:19:37] always divided that's why i called it
[1:19:39] the lighting of the lumps five and two
[1:19:41] he always divided his work between five
[1:19:44] and two
[1:19:45] he was either working with the two of
[1:19:46] them or he was working with a five now
[1:19:48] in the morning okay if the two were left
[1:19:52] he would immediately
[1:19:53] snowbird number five clean them all up
[1:19:56] fill them with oil and re-kindle them
[1:19:58] that's what he did amen
[1:19:59] and uh then even if the two had gone out
[1:20:04] and the five were lit he would still
[1:20:05] have done that he worked on the five uh
[1:20:08] at the start amen and i want to bring in
[1:20:11] that i hope you're with me that you can
[1:20:14] right away say well five is grace just
[1:20:16] keep that in thought five is grace
[1:20:18] hallelujah
[1:20:20] amen but that's the way he did it amen
[1:20:23] and it says even if he enters to find
[1:20:25] that the other five flames are still
[1:20:26] burning
[1:20:27] from the previous day he extinguishes
[1:20:30] them and replaces their oil and wicks uh
[1:20:32] and and and fills them again and
[1:20:34] rekindles them that's what he did now
[1:20:36] can you follow that so far
[1:20:38] okay amen now then you say what about
[1:20:40] the other two well if he looks over and
[1:20:42] says they're burning he lets them keep
[1:20:44] boarding and they are not touched until
[1:20:47] all the sacrifices of the day are over
[1:20:50] he might even be offering other
[1:20:51] sacrifices or he might be but he didn't
[1:20:53] touch them amen he didn't touch him
[1:20:56] until all them animals had been offered
[1:20:59] on the sacrificial altar amen and that
[1:21:01] was all done and even it is thought that
[1:21:05] the incense had already gone up before
[1:21:10] he worked on these last two amen and you
[1:21:12] know you look at the little steps baby
[1:21:15] steps i mean we we
[1:21:16] we have our sacrifice hallelujah we have
[1:21:19] the blood sacrifice for ourselves amen
[1:21:22] we're in a place night where we can pray
[1:21:25] hallelujah
[1:21:26] and prayer after that will bring
[1:21:30] testimony on witness
[1:21:32] that's the way it will work amen praise
[1:21:34] the lord right now
[1:21:36] praise the lord i want to just go on
[1:21:38] step up a little further here and uh i
[1:21:41] think we're doing all right for time i'd
[1:21:42] love to finish early but praise the lord
[1:21:45] amen
[1:21:46] amen
[1:21:48] okay
[1:21:49] now if you just can't have a look at
[1:21:51] that there i don't know what way this
[1:21:52] building's running brother brother dale
[1:21:54] but it doesn't really matter because
[1:21:55] that's the front door okay so let's just
[1:21:57] say uh it might not be but let's just
[1:22:00] say that's the east okay so that must be
[1:22:02] the west end and that's the way it is
[1:22:04] and and the temple and jerusalem amen
[1:22:07] and it's from east to west okay so if
[1:22:09] you come in and that door you would find
[1:22:12] five of these that way there the whole
[1:22:14] day one five la cantera they wouldn't be
[1:22:16] pointing that way when you come in the
[1:22:17] door they would be pointing that way so
[1:22:19] you'd have to come right okay and
[1:22:20] there'd be five here five five there
[1:22:22] amen and uh praise the lord as i say he
[1:22:26] would look at these five ones here
[1:22:28] and that's what he would first work on
[1:22:31] then an evening time he would work at
[1:22:32] these two because these two were kind of
[1:22:34] looked upon as special amen and uh
[1:22:37] praise the lord and let me just read
[1:22:39] what they say about amen that these
[1:22:43] flames had to uh be raised up constantly
[1:22:46] uh before the lord and uh it seems that
[1:22:50] if they did go out they would be relent
[1:22:52] amen but these two apparently for a long
[1:22:55] long time from the when when the altar
[1:22:57] the first time it came it was closed off
[1:22:58] the altar god lit that fire and from
[1:23:01] then on apparently either one of these
[1:23:04] or the two of them are born perpetually
[1:23:06] they didn't even have to change it and
[1:23:08] they would let them keep burning and
[1:23:09] that was a testimony that god was in
[1:23:13] with israel hallelujah that the priest
[1:23:15] could come out and say that is still
[1:23:17] burning and it was my grandfather's day
[1:23:20] we haven't put any oil in it we haven't
[1:23:21] changed the wick it's burning it was
[1:23:23] called the western candle amen and you
[1:23:25] know folks like i don't want to take you
[1:23:28] out of this church but you know
[1:23:30] something the western brother branham
[1:23:32] said that's coming from the east and it
[1:23:34] went to the west hallelujah and it's
[1:23:36] still burning hallelujah that to this
[1:23:38] day the light of god amen it was to be
[1:23:41] perpetual it wasn't the white amen and
[1:23:45] so uh praise the lord and uh the whole
[1:23:48] idea was that the improving uh the
[1:23:51] improvement of the the flames that's
[1:23:53] what you had been called the task the
[1:23:54] whole task but these these ones here
[1:23:57] were the improving of the flames and
[1:23:59] they happened after the blood sacrifice
[1:24:02] so you've got that so far it's not it's
[1:24:03] not too far on you okay praise the lord
[1:24:06] amen now the western candle
[1:24:08] yes amen and this this was this was this
[1:24:11] was quite something here because you can
[1:24:14] see him here working at the western
[1:24:16] candle amen so if you're coming in
[1:24:19] this one here is called the east
[1:24:20] actually and this is a bit irish to me
[1:24:23] you know
[1:24:26] but these two are called the eastern
[1:24:29] candles
[1:24:30] okay because they're closest to the east
[1:24:33] you see when you come in and under so
[1:24:35] they're closer there's this door you
[1:24:36] come in and the whole way down these two
[1:24:39] are closer they have to be closer to the
[1:24:40] least if they're pointed that way
[1:24:42] and so but this fella here the second
[1:24:46] one in was called the western candle you
[1:24:48] see although it was the too close and
[1:24:51] they were called the eastern but that
[1:24:52] one was called the western right now a
[1:24:54] brother saw me that probably never
[1:24:55] killed a man with us but if you left
[1:24:57] dublin airport and went down to the
[1:24:59] highway and it says
[1:25:01] sorry and you know i don't want to go
[1:25:02] outside i want to go north but actually
[1:25:04] you got to go right down south until you
[1:25:06] join the road that goes north
[1:25:09] that's the way it is both of them are
[1:25:11] called eastern but the one on the inside
[1:25:12] is called the western the western candle
[1:25:15] amen and praise the lord that was uh
[1:25:18] that was the one that had to be
[1:25:19] perpetually burning and uh well i i i i
[1:25:24] tell you what i suppose i could make a
[1:25:26] little uh a quote or not there
[1:25:29] amen
[1:25:30] fma
[1:25:31] as i say uh
[1:25:33] we just got some some time here amen
[1:25:39] the western candle uh one of the flames
[1:25:41] on the menorah the western which i just
[1:25:43] explained burned perpetually this is
[1:25:45] what they say and this love was never
[1:25:47] extinguished but it did it did go out in
[1:25:50] time so as i say he'd come in and
[1:25:53] he would work with them two at night
[1:25:55] after after all the sacrifices he would
[1:25:57] make sure if they're out they re-lit
[1:25:59] okay and then all the things burning
[1:26:01] into one light into one one lampstand
[1:26:04] amen and so uh here he is and uh it was
[1:26:08] to rise up constant constantly burning a
[1:26:10] lump amen
[1:26:11] and uh
[1:26:12] you know i was just thinking about it
[1:26:14] and i'm not here saying this this is a
[1:26:17] thoughts for you this morning amen that
[1:26:19] if you looked at it in the seven church
[1:26:21] ages well we certainly know on the day
[1:26:23] of pentecost god lit the light
[1:26:25] hallelujah that was the church he had
[1:26:27] started amen he certainly did like the
[1:26:28] light amen and if you looked at that and
[1:26:31] and the light of what just was said amen
[1:26:33] which i couldn't prove at all but the
[1:26:35] thing is that
[1:26:36] i can take it that that's the way they
[1:26:37] did it and uh that second what i was
[1:26:40] thinking well that would have been
[1:26:41] iranians
[1:26:42] and uh a perpetual late and brother
[1:26:45] branham said you know arenas was was the
[1:26:48] man that set the whole scriptures in
[1:26:50] order right iran as you ever read his
[1:26:52] writings he'll tell you that there was
[1:26:54] not five gospels there was four gospels
[1:26:58] now that might seem elementary to us but
[1:27:01] when you go deeper into it hallelujah
[1:27:03] around that tabernacle you had to for
[1:27:05] them tribes amen and around the throne
[1:27:08] you had the cherubims the fourth
[1:27:09] serbians and it has to be forward and
[1:27:12] you've got the holy ghost in the mirror
[1:27:14] you kind of fire gospels why because
[1:27:16] it's matthew mark luke and john
[1:27:19] goes to the middle of the book of acts
[1:27:21] so your your numerology is important
[1:27:23] hallelujah and it has to be correct amen
[1:27:26] and so i i was thinking about that and
[1:27:29] and and i really just did that for us
[1:27:31] hallelujah and then we could see why he
[1:27:33] did it right with the revolution we've
[1:27:34] got and then not only that there but
[1:27:38] brother brown said iranians taught the
[1:27:40] rapture
[1:27:41] like we believe it right he did
[1:27:43] hallelujah and the thing about it is
[1:27:45] this that folks that is a perpetual
[1:27:48] light all right man hey man they're not
[1:27:50] going to be too different
[1:27:52] they're going to be two different
[1:27:53] raptures right then poor are you going
[1:27:55] to go up first with his left and you
[1:27:56] know all willy nilly and god said hold
[1:27:58] on who's coming now it ain't going to
[1:28:00] work like that hallelujah amen it's a
[1:28:02] perpetual light hallelujah what a
[1:28:05] realist believe in his people and we
[1:28:08] believe i'm the dead in christ shall
[1:28:10] rise first and then we which elijah
[1:28:12] shall go to be with the lord i mean
[1:28:13] we'll meet the lord in there
[1:28:15] so it's a perpetual life and also he he
[1:28:18] he he taught the oneness of the godhead
[1:28:21] right i realized
[1:28:22] so the thing is
[1:28:24] amen thank you you know i praise god
[1:28:26] hallelujah that he had that revelation
[1:28:29] amen he didn't get sucked into some
[1:28:31] roman doctrine
[1:28:32] and you know where is every church in
[1:28:35] the world today that's hanging under the
[1:28:37] coattails of the church of rome right
[1:28:40] amen
[1:28:41] that's the ones that brought it in at
[1:28:43] the council of nazia that taught that
[1:28:45] there was a father son holy ghost and
[1:28:47] three persons
[1:28:48] something that the bible has never said
[1:28:50] i never will say right
[1:28:52] so he taught that as a perpetual night
[1:28:55] folks hallelujah
[1:28:56] whatever then to see uh last year when i
[1:28:59] left you and i got the dublin my wife
[1:29:01] was already waiting for me i'm my
[1:29:03] sister-in-law i could see drove
[1:29:06] and i changed into my suit and we went
[1:29:08] down to the israeli embassy i had all my
[1:29:10] luggage in the back of the car i thought
[1:29:12] they're going to make it hard for me
[1:29:13] here because
[1:29:14] but they didn't they just opened up the
[1:29:16] gate you're expected come on in so i
[1:29:18] parked the car jumped up we went through
[1:29:20] their little security thing not very
[1:29:21] much i can tell you and we had a little
[1:29:24] gifts on that the the the security
[1:29:26] people wanted to look at that
[1:29:28] and they did but then he brought it up
[1:29:30] to the ambassador and we were up in a
[1:29:32] suite and as we talked about the times
[1:29:35] we'd hired and and a lovely man he came
[1:29:37] right up the dummy goal and it was
[1:29:39] wonderful and uh so i was saying you
[1:29:42] know ambassador there's one thing i want
[1:29:44] to tell you before you go back to israel
[1:29:46] and he said yes because i always bring
[1:29:48] him back to scripture sometimes he would
[1:29:50] go off into the sector and bring them
[1:29:51] back again right and
[1:29:53] anyway it's a good job
[1:29:57] and i'll tell you what
[1:30:00] that i said mr ambassador i want you to
[1:30:02] know some things that i do not believe
[1:30:06] in a godhead of three persons right
[1:30:08] right
[1:30:09] i told him
[1:30:11] you see
[1:30:12] i asked and i know you're a good friend
[1:30:14] of john
[1:30:14] okay
[1:30:16] he said yes he said we never say too
[1:30:18] much about doctrine we're over there
[1:30:22] i said well i want you to know that the
[1:30:24] fellow you're talking to believes and
[1:30:26] the god god of abraham isaac and jacob
[1:30:30] hallelujah amen i couldn't expect them
[1:30:33] brother dick to go into the full
[1:30:34] revolution but i'll tell you what he
[1:30:36] believes in one god hallelujah they were
[1:30:38] slaughtered because they believed in one
[1:30:40] god right and that's the testimony they
[1:30:42] carried amen and that's the testimony we
[1:30:44] carry that's the testimony that an
[1:30:46] iranian
[1:30:49] amen and burning burning so ever
[1:30:52] brightly amen praise the lord okay well
[1:30:55] not doing so bad don't think for time
[1:30:57] praise the lord five five and two amen
[1:31:00] no i just so we've got that all laid
[1:31:02] down for you a little bit of foundation
[1:31:05] praise the lord
[1:31:07] you know i'll give you an opportunity
[1:31:09] here this morning just for a second
[1:31:11] where in the bible do you read a five
[1:31:13] and two
[1:31:14] just think about it no it's not a trick
[1:31:16] question
[1:31:18] and the life of jesus
[1:31:19] there was a time when there was five and
[1:31:21] two wasn't there what was it that's when
[1:31:23] a little boy
[1:31:25] brought his five years and two faces
[1:31:27] right now i'm not trying to make them in
[1:31:28] order five rules and two faces but i'm
[1:31:31] just trying to show you that it was the
[1:31:32] grace of god and it was a witness
[1:31:35] hallelujah and a testimony
[1:31:37] amen and there he was and why did he
[1:31:39] bring that bread
[1:31:41] it was that christ could feed a hungry
[1:31:45] people
[1:31:45] hallelujah why did he come that he could
[1:31:48] feed a hungry people amen the true
[1:31:52] bread of god that came down from heaven
[1:31:55] john 6 if you're looking it up john 6 33
[1:31:58] 35 51 read the whole chapter amen i am
[1:32:02] the true bread that is combined from
[1:32:04] heaven hallelujah amen and giveth life
[1:32:08] to the world right praise god you know
[1:32:11] we were making little jokes and all that
[1:32:13] but i remember hearing a story one time
[1:32:15] i don't know if i ever told you but i'll
[1:32:16] tell you not just very briefly and you
[1:32:19] know when you're rich and you can do a
[1:32:21] lot of things so there must have been a
[1:32:22] big cemetery hell and this little guy
[1:32:24] must have been a multi-billionaire
[1:32:26] whatever he was and he loved his
[1:32:28] gold-plated cadillac
[1:32:30] he loved that so he decided because
[1:32:32] money talks he decided that he was going
[1:32:34] to be buried in his gold plated cadillac
[1:32:38] well that's his business
[1:32:40] and so the day the funeral came and they
[1:32:43] were all organized and there he was he
[1:32:45] was placed into the front driver's seat
[1:32:47] hey man probably hold on to the weight
[1:32:49] don't know what he was going to drive to
[1:32:51] he's right
[1:33:04] and so anyway they got him up
[1:33:06] and it was just too much for one of
[1:33:08] these great gravediggers you know and
[1:33:10] there they were lowering them down you
[1:33:12] know i
[1:33:13] i

[1:33:16] into the hole

[1:33:19] over and the other one he said money

[1:48:25] when i'm what i'm going to tell you now
[1:48:27] she's talking about marriage and divorce
[1:48:28] but i want you to just generalize it the
[1:48:30] whole message amen because he got it he
[1:48:32] got the series by revelation he said i
[1:48:34] didn't know what it was and he got it by
[1:48:36] revelation praise the lord i'm just
[1:48:37] going to bring out something that this
[1:48:39] afternoon amen god willing no i praise
[1:48:41] the lord amen and he says here i was
[1:48:44] it's going to be revealed to me and he
[1:48:46] said i'm speaking to my followers only
[1:48:48] people in the message and uh a bear me
[1:48:50] record before god and he said now we
[1:48:53] find out this mess because of
[1:48:55] misinterpreted theology
[1:48:57] look at the many things theology has
[1:48:59] misinterpreted
[1:49:00] my mind they tell us so much hallelujah
[1:49:02] and they kind of they're so blind
[1:49:04] themselves blind ludacea they cannot see
[1:49:06] themselves amen praise the lord and here
[1:49:09] he was and then he talks about how the
[1:49:12] lord had granted moses a bill of
[1:49:14] divorcement amen because of the hardness
[1:49:16] of their heart and my brother brought
[1:49:18] him to stand up and in that tabernacle
[1:49:20] and say no i that every one of you here
[1:49:22] was waiting for this answer that up to
[1:49:25] that moment right to that moment if you
[1:49:26] have been married two or three times
[1:49:28] don't do it again stay with your partner
[1:49:30] don't leave or not you know the story as
[1:49:32] well as i do so that got sorted out but
[1:49:34] never do it again hallelujah so we don't
[1:49:37] marry twice or three times say man i'll
[1:49:39] tell you what it's a time that's a dodgy
[1:49:40] thing praise god you'll never break that
[1:49:42] claim amen so anyway
[1:49:45] praise the lord and you know i can even
[1:49:48] say that we talked about moses we talked
[1:49:49] about brother branham and you know these
[1:49:52] men of god
[1:49:53] do get
[1:49:54] these things from god right as he said
[1:49:56] he got it there god was speaking to him
[1:49:59] okay and
[1:50:00] when saint patrick was praying for
[1:50:03] ireland he had a special request to god
[1:50:06] that no irish man living would serve the
[1:50:09] antichrist
[1:50:11] and all i can tell you friends is this
[1:50:13] that god said
[1:50:15] i hear your prayer
[1:50:16] i hear your prayer i've got in my bible
[1:50:19] here a way back in the psalms or
[1:50:21] somewhere i got there don't know if i
[1:50:22] could even get it for you tonight it's
[1:50:23] but it's in here somewhere last year
[1:50:25] i've got it written down i've got
[1:50:27] brother uh raju babu his name on it i've
[1:50:30] got his little uh wife's name i think

[1:50:34] rhea she's always corrected me or not
[1:50:36] and it's ria and they had no child amen
[1:50:39] and i'll tell you what i was delighted
[1:50:41] to come back from india last year and
[1:50:44] brother freddie wrote me this year that
[1:50:46] she's expecting her first baby amen and
[1:50:49] i've got it written down and all it was
[1:50:51] is the lord said i have heard your
[1:50:53] prayer right here that's all right
[1:50:56] praise god so it's wonderful hallelujah
[1:50:59] amen and and patrick got that from god
[1:51:03] that he heard his prayer no irish man
[1:51:05] will be living to serve the antichrist
[1:51:07] on ireland you know why
[1:51:09] because it will be flooded out right
[1:51:11] that's why there'll be none there over
[1:51:13] that great tribulation to serve the
[1:51:15] antichrist amen i'm so glad about that
[1:51:17] praise the lord so amen and here it was
[1:51:20] but i wonder just in the last couple of
[1:51:22] minutes of the of the ministry this
[1:51:24] morning and i want you to
[1:51:27] this is where i found it in that
[1:51:29] generation book
[1:51:30] sister evans and brother ronnie evans
[1:51:32] testimony of what they said and then
[1:51:35] tied them with what i told you this
[1:51:36] morning
[1:51:37] it says
[1:51:39] one morning welch had gone to the stage
[1:51:41] and that's her husband and ronnie and i
[1:51:43] took martha g and my youngest to school
[1:51:46] it was a beautiful day and there could
[1:51:47] be some beautiful days in tucson and
[1:51:49] there was not a cloud in the sky
[1:51:51] we dropped her off and we're on our way
[1:51:54] back to the station when ronnie said
[1:51:56] mama look at the mountains
[1:51:59] look at them clothes okay clouds not
[1:52:02] climbing clouds now broadband said cloud
[1:52:04] and it was a cloud because when you
[1:52:06] light the seven you get a cloud amen
[1:52:08] okay and so he says i looked it was
[1:52:11] right
[1:52:12] up the place called finger rock and
[1:52:14] there was this cluster
[1:52:16] of amber
[1:52:17] clouds amen
[1:52:19] and we watched them
[1:52:20] and sometime
[1:52:22] there would appear five
[1:52:25] and here
[1:52:26] too
[1:52:27] amen
[1:52:29] am i reading this right here
[1:52:30] yes i'm reading right
[1:52:32] then
[1:52:33] they changed the rhyme
[1:52:36] and then there would be two
[1:52:38] and five
[1:52:40] you see
[1:52:41] for about 45 minutes
[1:52:43] it was strange we sat there
[1:52:46] and we watched ronnie said i know where
[1:52:48] brother brown's at it's got to be right
[1:52:50] up there i said you know only god could
[1:52:53] do that it's so different i've never
[1:52:55] seen anything like that amen praise the
[1:52:59] lord never seen anything like that amen
[1:53:02] and that is wonderful praise the lord
[1:53:05] can you see god keeping his same order
[1:53:08] right as he had there let it in the
[1:53:10] tabernacle amen he's talking to his
[1:53:13] prophet right he hasn't changed
[1:53:16] this wouldn't mean i think i'd say this
[1:53:17] message
[1:53:19] people would incur anything
[1:53:21] you see
[1:53:23] about that
[1:53:24] and as i said earlier that first church
[1:53:27] is he said if you don't repent he said i
[1:53:29] will remove the candlestick
[1:53:31] i'll remove the witness right yep that's
[1:53:33] right
[1:53:34] and so here you have it email imagine
[1:53:36] five and two
[1:53:38] then two and five right now why was it
[1:53:41] not four and three and and or section
[1:53:43] one or not because god was keeping his
[1:53:45] order right that's what as he talked to
[1:53:48] brother branham and he's talking to us
[1:53:50] he said i am a god of order hallelujah
[1:53:52] my message is one hallelujah i'm
[1:53:54] unchanging my word doesn't change
[1:53:57] hallelujah how i did it at the beginning
[1:53:59] the original seed is the same way as it
[1:54:01] is the whole way through amen and praise
[1:54:04] the lord amen that's just wonderful
[1:54:06] praise god amen speaking forth the
[1:54:09] revelation amen of grace
[1:54:12] right grace to his bride hallelujah and
[1:54:16] witness witnessing to it as you have the
[1:54:18] two amber amber lumps
[1:54:21] praise god coming up and dying amen so
[1:54:23] that's just that's where i got them
[1:54:25] thoughts
[1:54:26] amen and just to see god
[1:54:28] keeping his continuity right amen not
[1:54:30] changing it five and two that's what you
[1:54:33] saw and then they would all come into
[1:54:34] one cluster and whatever not and it's
[1:54:36] beautiful hallelujah that god never
[1:54:39] changes his order he never changes his
[1:54:41] way to do things you know folks i think
[1:54:43] we started somewhere this morning your
[1:54:45] only belief i tell you what you get me
[1:54:48] somewhere where it says only believe on
[1:54:50] right
[1:54:51] right right god will not change his
[1:54:53] order amen praise god as you approach
[1:54:55] him right there in that tabernacle
[1:54:58] he will not change his order praise god
[1:55:00] and so it's so wonderful this morning
[1:55:02] hallelujah i'm glad we've got to go like
[1:55:04] that
[1:55:06] that's perfect hallelujah and all things
[1:55:09] are amen as brother ronald was saying up
[1:55:11] there i mean god doesn't have to call a
[1:55:13] crisis meeting
[1:55:15] we we might have to but i'll tell you
[1:55:16] what he certainly does not
[1:55:18] praise god yes amen i wanted i can't
