[12:07] to Athens and a doctor and Athens said I
[12:11] don't say they didn't even mention

[13:32] Revelations 1
[13:36] 1-3
[13:38] the revelation of Jesus Christ was God
[13:40] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[13:42] things which must shortly
[13:43] come to pass any sin and signified it by
[13:46] his Angel unto his servant John
[13:49] who by record of the word of God and the
[13:51] testimony of Jesus Christ of all things
[13:53] that he saw
[13:55] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[13:57] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[14:00] those things which are written therein
[14:02] for the time is at hand what the time to
[14:05] understand is at hand now First Peter 1
[14:09] 9 receiving the end of your faith even
[14:11] the salvation of your souls of which
[14:14] salvation of the prophets have inquired
[14:16] in church diligently who profits out of
[14:19] the grace that should come unto you
[14:21] searching what or what manner of time
[14:23] the spirit of Christ which is in them
[14:25] did signify when it testified beforehand
[14:28] the sufferings of Christ and the glory
[14:30] that should follow
[14:31] unto whom it was revealed that not unto
[14:34] themselves but unto us they did Minister
[14:36] the things which are now recorded unto
[14:39] you
[14:40] by them that have preached the gospel
[14:43] unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down
[14:45] from heaven which things the Angels
[14:48] desire to look into
[14:50] look what he concludes it wherefore gird
[14:52] up the loins of your mind be sober and
[14:54] hope to the end for the grace that is to
[14:58] be brought to you at the revelation of
[15:01] Jesus Christ you may be seated the Lord
[15:04] that is blessing
[15:06] to the reading of the word
[15:09] now
[15:11] we've got through
[15:14] covered basically
[15:16] chapter 5 and all and now we're going to
[15:19] a little bit we read Revelation 6 1 and
[15:22] then we'll
[15:23] start in our thoughts but
[15:26] you know
[15:28] the main thing I'm wanting you to see is
[15:30] like I've tried to emphasize over and
[15:32] over
[15:35] that
[15:36] the actual seal itself are the
[15:38] manifestation maybe as a way of saying
[15:42] it of those things under the seals will
[15:46] transpire after we leave out of here
[15:49] we have already be in the Rapture we'll
[15:51] already be in glory while that is taking
[15:54] place upon the Earth all right see in
[15:58] doing that then we look back like we
[16:00] were talking this morning that actually
[16:02] the seals broke
[16:04] back there to over 2 000 years ago
[16:07] because Jesus actually preached them
[16:11] in the scriptures of Matthew 24.
[16:14] he breathed six of us the yields and
[16:17] placed it there in the scripture all
[16:18] right then John goes to Patmos
[16:21] and what does he see he sees what Jesus
[16:25] preached
[16:27] amen but he can only get it as it's
[16:30] revealed to it and we'll cover this in a
[16:33] minute then he'll get it in a symbol
[16:35] form
[16:38] all right in that symbol form was to
[16:41] last until the end time
[16:43] when God would send us a prophet
[16:47] to be able to understand the symbols of
[16:51] the Bible and then he could break those
[16:54] things to the prophet or reveal it to
[16:57] him because it's already broken I keep
[16:59] emphasizing that people they're arguing
[17:02] now among the message people that six of
[17:05] the seals are broke and and the sale
[17:07] it's not broke yet all right then others
[17:09] pick it up and say that the Sabbath is
[17:12] not revealed yet you know it's just one
[17:15] thing after another of mankind trying to
[17:18] figure out those things but the Bible
[17:21] says it's open well then at least at
[17:24] least we should agree with that part
[17:26] right
[17:27] so it comes in Revelation 8 1 it says
[17:29] you know in the opening the seventh seal
[17:31] all right it has to be opened or John
[17:35] would not have been able to spoke about
[17:37] it nmc bringing it to us as a church
[17:41] symbol
[17:42] and we even read there to last this
[17:45] morning that Lorena said we're seeing
[17:47] here tonight on the seventh seal what
[17:49] took place in heaven two thousand years
[17:52] ago are in glory
[17:54] all right John was taken up
[17:57] in Revelations 4 1.
[18:01] and he sees all of these things
[18:04] and he writes it down all right now
[18:07] seeing it from a Heavenly scene
[18:10] then God is revealing that that's going
[18:14] to take place on the earth and that's
[18:16] what we want to deal with it is the part
[18:19] of being on Earth
[18:21] in a manifestation down here on Earth
[18:23] and seeing and see our day and its time
[18:26] but the main thing if you're
[18:28] understanding me then the seals are
[18:30] broke
[18:31] the prophet didn't break the seals the
[18:34] prophet was the seals were revealed to
[18:37] the prophet because they were already
[18:39] broken
[18:41] you'll read quotes now and and all and I
[18:43] know people will read it and they'll
[18:45] take it but they won't take everything
[18:47] but they'll read you know that they'll
[18:49] find where brother man said see there
[18:51] said the lamb broke the seal
[18:54] the lamb opened the seal well just
[18:56] remember that's what is happening
[18:58] but it started 2 000 years ago
[19:03] back there when John went to Patmos and
[19:06] saw these things huh
[19:08] but then it was placed before Mankind in
[19:12] a symbol form
[19:14] waiting the opportunity for the prophet
[19:18] to come to be able to speak to us amen
[19:20] and tell us what these things are
[19:23] and that was worth it he made his
[19:25] mistake in his early Ministry but he was
[19:27] preaching the white horse rider
[19:30] as Jesus Christ
[19:32] then he comes on over later like it's in
[19:35] one is in another sister we're talking
[19:37] about want to go it's in Daniel 70 weeks
[19:39] he mentions that the white horse riders
[19:41] the Antichrist
[19:43] you see clerks Larkin
[19:46] preached the one horse rider
[19:49] was the Antichrist before brother
[19:51] Randall never came along
[19:53] but he wasn't the prophet amen I've
[19:56] always said it and I don't mean it as a
[19:58] joke
[19:59] he was in the system
[20:02] that was the Antichrist system
[20:05] and it was a trinitarian probably
[20:09] and so the the scripture couldn't have
[20:11] been broke but he was just saying for
[20:13] what he could see
[20:14] point something to him all right and
[20:17] that was well and good whatever he saw
[20:19] but he wasn't the prophet
[20:22] see the symbol couldn't break
[20:24] he couldn't see what that was because
[20:27] the prophet said it was sealed until and
[20:31] the Bible said it was even Daniel says
[20:33] the book is sealed me
[20:36] right it was a seal book well I was
[20:38] looking at it this morning would run
[20:39] around and said they're laying back
[20:41] there he said
[20:43] we didn't know the book was sealed
[20:47] well that's in the silver
[20:50] well you know how many times right now
[20:52] how many times he said before that the
[20:54] book was see him
[20:57] but he in other words it's coming down
[20:59] that we didn't know how it's sealed
[21:01] what's going on
[21:03] but now we can see it
[21:06] so there was no way that the prophet
[21:08] could be the lamb
[21:10] he couldn't take the book you couldn't
[21:13] reveal the book because that was the
[21:14] statement or the proclamation
[21:18] that no man was worthy right
[21:23] the only one that was worthy was the
[21:25] Lord Jesus Christ amen the only one who
[21:28] could take the book
[21:29] open the seals
[21:31] is the Lord Jesus Christ the only one
[21:34] that can reveal the seals is the Lord
[21:35] Jesus Christ so we thank God for the
[21:38] prophet that could tell us these things
[21:42] and he was the one making those
[21:44] statements
[21:46] and bringing it to where you and I could
[21:48] follow it
[21:50] and then see the end time
[21:53] that we would be waiting it was in a
[21:56] symbol for him the word that the church
[21:58] wouldn't see what's going on like I said
[22:01] if we if it wasn't in symbol for him
[22:05] see they wouldn't be no mystery
[22:08] there wouldn't be no waiting
[22:11] and all this be open right the whole
[22:15] Bible is written symbols on
[22:18] Parables and money amen that way
[22:23] he would keep you and I on our toes
[22:25] trying to study it out
[22:27] trying to see wanting to know
[22:31] yes man what these things work
[22:34] you see I thank God I run into the man I
[22:36] did to introduce me to the message
[22:39] because he began to talk about the seals
[22:41] and the things
[22:43] he would just talk a little and
[22:45] I had beginning to read
[22:47] well I wanted one of them seal books
[22:50] you know
[22:52] but he didn't want me to have one of
[22:54] them
[22:56] and he told me he did
[22:59] I said well I want to get in them seals
[23:01] he said don't want you to
[23:04] he said I want you to get a background a
[23:06] study
[23:09] so he gave me certain messages
[23:12] he gave me a church age book in the
[23:14] things you know
[23:16] I've told you this many times before but
[23:19] did it finally one day he said I think
[23:21] you can understand here you can now see
[23:23] a book
[23:24] well you know what I'm honest and admit
[23:26] it I ain't really enjoyed it it was
[23:28] really opening of a lot of things in my
[23:30] eyes but
[23:32] I'm as honest as can be where most
[23:34] people say well well I read that to your
[23:36] book
[23:37] and man that's wonderful
[23:39] well that's true
[23:41] do you know what I'm doing
[23:44] I realized that I wasn't understanding
[23:46] what he was saying
[23:50] you know what I've done
[23:52] I like to see a book down
[23:54] I went back to the church handbook
[23:58] because I had enough understanding
[24:01] that I had to get a background
[24:04] because if it wasn't opening up the way
[24:06] that I thought it would I realized I
[24:09] must go back
[24:10] I went back to the church age book I
[24:12] studied that church a book about the
[24:15] ages and things
[24:17] and then one day I started back in
[24:19] reading the seal book
[24:21] well you know what I got a lot better
[24:23] understanding
[24:24] because I began to see the layout the
[24:27] ways he was speaking and the things that
[24:30] would help me to understand
[24:33] but what if I didn't have the background
[24:35] now we're going to read in a minute
[24:37] and we're going to show that the
[24:38] Antichrist
[24:41] is a spirit
[24:43] right right now what if you didn't have
[24:45] the background to see how the ages came
[24:47] down
[24:50] and at that nickel Nathan Spirit started
[24:52] back there
[24:54] and come down
[24:55] and he's still here today
[24:58] how would you understand the Antichrist
[25:02] but see then that's what I've tried to
[25:04] get people to see the seals is a
[25:06] revelation of Jesus Christ
[25:10] it's not revealing the Antichrist
[25:14] the Antichrist is revealed in opposition
[25:19] I ordered trinitarian take a seal book
[25:22] you pick it up and read and eat it you
[25:24] know we just give him a little bit out
[25:26] of him and you read Diary Norman Blood
[25:29] Horse ridership
[25:31] Antichrist
[25:38] Larkin said that
[25:41] many other people may have said that
[25:45] it wouldn't mean a thing
[25:49] but you see that's why that struck me
[25:50] because that's
[25:52] the way they open to me
[25:55] and I was telling you I told you many
[25:57] times I was running a job that that it
[25:59] took two men to run when I was out
[26:02] they were trying to pressure me into
[26:04] quitting
[26:05] and I just held on
[26:08] until the God come on the scene to
[26:10] release it
[26:12] but in doing all of that I was writing
[26:14] notes
[26:15] to come home and preach
[26:18] off the seals and things
[26:20] well then it just unfolded that first
[26:22] seal if it wasn't the Antichrist
[26:25] being revealed it was a revelation of
[26:28] Jesus Christ
[26:30] all right now I could see that
[26:33] but then one day and just something just
[26:35] down through my knowledge just spoke
[26:39] he said
[26:40] when you see two people in the Bible
[26:43] one of them's got to be in the
[26:44] Antichrist
[26:47] because there's no two people in God
[26:50] right
[26:52] that's what people in this message the
[26:54] two Lords of people like that
[26:56] they say that Jesus was one person and
[26:58] God was another
[27:02] that's his trinitarianism any
[27:04] trinitarian concept we're right
[27:06] when you say this two persons there's
[27:09] many manifestations of God
[27:12] but there's only one Reverend said he is
[27:14] not the second person he's not the
[27:17] first even the first person right
[27:21] he said he is the person that's right
[27:24] all right
[27:25] so then when I read to see a book the
[27:27] next time I began to see
[27:30] you know invite you to go through the
[27:31] seal book and just read and underline
[27:35] every time he talks about
[27:37] that Antichrist and he'll say see that
[27:41] other guy
[27:43] see that other fellow
[27:46] see him riding off I'm sitting here
[27:49] stands a lamb
[27:50] with a book in his hand
[27:52] went to a trinitarian I wouldn't mean a
[27:55] thing with it a trinitarian you can have
[27:57] three or four people sitting on the book
[27:59] in his hand
[28:02] you know he got all in person running
[28:03] around right
[28:06] my brother around him you know what he
[28:07] said he says my Revelation Christ the
[28:10] lamb and the Holy Ghost is the same
[28:12] person
[28:14] amen and he said then that other fellow
[28:17] writing off
[28:20] another guy leaving right
[28:23] you would have to be the Antichrist
[28:24] right right
[28:26] George revealing Jesus Christ
[28:32] not revealing of the of the Antichrist
[28:37] it's a revealing of Jesus Christ amen
[28:39] let's quote prayer this morning who is
[28:41] those seal
[28:43] it's revelation of Jesus Christ
[28:45] amen he is no seals the prophet would
[28:48] say
[28:49] you see then you said well what about
[28:51] the Antichrist that's the opposition
[28:56] you know you see people in the message
[28:57] preachers they're constantly beating you
[29:00] over the head with everything
[29:03] and they said boy we got a hard message
[29:06] well we got a hard Mission 40 years
[29:08] later boy we got a heart mission
[29:10] 40 years later they're still preaching
[29:12] the same thing they was 40 years ago
[29:17] he said well no no I ain't tell nobody
[29:19] how to preach
[29:21] I'm just telling you how that it looks
[29:23] to me okay right
[29:26] if you haven't progressed an
[29:28] understanding in 40 years
[29:30] I'm not going to sell you your back foot
[29:33] I'm going to tell you you're lost
[29:38] that point enough I'm not going to say
[29:41] you're back to it I'm going to say
[29:43] you're lost
[29:45] you mean we've been studying a book
[29:48] will that be something for the doctors
[29:52] a little over 100 years ago
[29:55] somebody get sick man you're just so
[29:58] weak and rung out you go to the doctor
[30:00] and then you just you're staggering to
[30:03] get in he sets you down he said yep
[30:07] we need to be bleed you a pie
[30:11] right right
[30:14] that was their way of
[30:16] getting the blood to redo itself and you
[30:19] know what a lot of people got well but
[30:21] you know what a lot of people died they
[30:24] needed a couple of pints instead of
[30:26] making a few out of them what would the
[30:29] doctors today say come on
[30:32] well I think that's the way it is in the
[30:35] message
[30:36] I think it's about time the prophet said
[30:38] to rub out some unbelief yeah yes the
[30:41] more we can see the true revelation of
[30:44] Jesus Christ
[30:46] amen right well brother damn all I've
[30:48] ever known my whole life is I read the
[30:49] seal books and that first seals one or
[30:52] Friday
[30:53] yeah because that's where you've been
[30:54] touted
[30:58] but have you seen Jesus Christ
[31:02] if you haven't seen Jesus Christ through
[31:04] the opening of the word
[31:06] then the word's not open not plan enough
[31:09] right amen no stumbling stuttering
[31:11] there's nothing just plain
[31:14] Lauren said if you read the Bible
[31:16] and don't see Christ in every verse
[31:19] what did he say he said go back and read
[31:23] it again cause you missed something
[31:27] joints over God so and so and so and so
[31:29] we got so-and-so and so and so to God so
[31:31] and so and so and so they got so and so
[31:33] and I'm quoting scripture right
[31:37] that's hard to see Christ isn't it
[31:43] that's what he said
[31:45] but after a while you find out them
[31:47] shorts over God so-and-so leads you
[31:49] right down to David
[31:51] all right so until we got so-and-so
[31:55] leads you right down to Jesus Christ
[31:56] right
[31:58] so it is Christ in every verse
[32:00] you're not looking for Jesus in every
[32:02] word
[32:04] he's looking for Christ
[32:06] all right see when you see the Christ
[32:11] in your true born-again Christian
[32:13] you won't see Christ somewhere else
[32:15] we're going to get to that in a minute
[32:16] now
[32:19] you don't see Christ somewhere else
[32:23] brother told me one time he said I see
[32:27] Christ in in myself I said good
[32:30] but you got to see Christ in Jesus first
[32:34] because you see it in yourself you might
[32:36] wind up being Antichrist
[32:40] come on
[32:41] but if you see it in Jesus and then see
[32:43] that same Christ
[32:46] dwelling in you
[32:49] then you see in Jesus Christ
[32:51] that's all the message the prophet broke
[32:54] I thought the whole Bible was a
[32:56] revelation of Jesus Christ
[33:01] see then if you look at that first
[33:02] ceiling read it you'll see that he's
[33:05] talking about some other fellow and some
[33:06] other guy something else
[33:09] please
[33:11] in opposition to you
[33:15] but as I said now we'll get back to the
[33:17] scripture in a minute
[33:19] if you can't see Christ in the Bible
[33:23] and now you're going to see them in
[33:24] yourself
[33:25] that's right right
[33:29] and then what are you going to do with
[33:30] no man be called Jesus the Christ
[33:34] accepted me by what somebody else say it
[33:37] and then what scripture is saying
[33:40] no
[33:42] except it be the Christ is in you
[33:47] all right
[33:48] the Christ is in you then you can see it
[33:50] all right so let's think on these things
[33:53] now and just start on something
[33:56] John sees whoever ended up this morning
[33:59] two thousand years ago
[34:01] in glory of the opening of the seals
[34:06] it was almost 2 000 years
[34:09] before it would come down to someone
[34:14] that would be on earth
[34:18] that could understand those symbols
[34:21] right
[34:23] that's right I hope you see where the
[34:25] emphasis is being put if God hadn't sent
[34:27] us a prophet
[34:29] where would we be
[34:33] where would we be today if God hadn't
[34:35] sent a prophet to you and I
[34:37] will be sitting out there unorganized
[34:39] religion this is like everything else
[34:40] and you know what we'd be doing right
[34:45] right I know you don't like to meet
[34:47] Grand because you know something's
[34:48] fixing to come
[34:50] we would be Glory Hallelujah we're in
[34:53] the bride
[34:55] playing it great that we're serving God
[34:58] one of the one of them because it's
[35:01] three persons of him and we don't know
[35:03] so maybe one of them is taking care of
[35:06] us
[35:08] right right
[35:13] where would we be if God hadn't sent a
[35:15] prophet
[35:21] he promised he'd do it
[35:23] amen what's that Prophet to do
[35:27] take all of the Loose Ends that man has
[35:30] left
[35:34] foreign
[35:37] and reveal the word
[35:39] that's right
[35:40] do you and I
[35:44] that we could become that word and walk
[35:46] off the earth
[35:48] so now
[35:51] and we were saying that
[35:53] as we start on this we back up to where
[35:55] we were in chapter five the prophet said
[35:58] this is the accident opening of those
[36:00] seals
[36:02] because the bride is in glory at that
[36:04] time
[36:09] but you know what like I've always told
[36:12] you now matching pieces right
[36:16] until we match what's there and we're
[36:18] not going there amen that's right is
[36:21] that a sensible statement amen right
[36:23] right when Martin Luther
[36:25] preached the just shall live by faith
[36:28] that was that angel in glory that was
[36:31] with the what is the Everlasting gospel
[36:33] remember that
[36:36] Monroe said that was Everlasting gospel
[36:38] what the just to live by faith
[36:42] you know until he came to that place
[36:45] he didn't match what was in heaven that
[36:47] was singing him
[36:49] but one day he did
[36:53] when you and I match it will be gone
[36:58] won't be because the bus is just pulling
[37:00] up for us
[37:04] it'll be what the scripture said they
[37:06] without us cannot be made perfect
[37:09] right right
[37:12] it'll be what Romans says
[37:16] but the whole world is growing and
[37:18] waiting
[37:19] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[37:27] all right you remember that message
[37:28] don't you
[37:30] what does the word manifestation mean
[37:36] well a great signs and wonders right
[37:39] there
[37:40] yeah yeah
[37:43] manifest means to make known
[37:48] right you know what right around done
[37:51] he stood on the platform and made God
[37:54] known all right I told you my personal
[37:57] opinion this is personal that was why he
[37:59] wouldn't let nobody preach he did for a
[38:01] long time you let people preach and he'd
[38:04] come out and pray for the sick
[38:06] right that was an early Ministry
[38:09] why don't you quit that
[38:14] because there wasn't none of them
[38:15] preaching it the way he wanted to preach
[38:17] that's right that's my opinion whatever
[38:20] yours is I don't know
[38:24] but see he didn't there was no message
[38:26] involved
[38:29] and he knew he'd come to bring a message
[38:32] amen so he brought his own message yeah
[38:35] many people
[38:37] went with the signs and wonders because
[38:40] it was the opening of the word see
[38:42] that's what the whole world was waiting
[38:44] on
[38:46] him and for a moment there it shall
[38:49] but it was Desiring
[38:53] all right
[38:54] now
[38:57] but yet as great as he was and all that
[39:00] brought around him done
[39:03] that didn't save one person
[39:07] I know that's hard speech to people but
[39:10] if I hadn't put enough emphasis upon
[39:12] what I believe you're in that
[39:15] the whole world was waiting upon this
[39:17] man we call William Branham to come
[39:22] we get a good save nobody
[39:25] that's right
[39:27] no Jesus Christ is the only one could
[39:29] save anybody
[39:32] he can't reveal anything
[39:35] his lips can be used
[39:38] his thoughts could be used
[39:40] but he couldn't reveal it takes the Holy
[39:42] Spirit to reveal it
[39:45] see then once you start then as we're
[39:47] going to do in the symbols
[39:52] just remember
[39:56] in his early Ministry even he didn't
[39:58] know these things
[40:01] because he preached it
[40:05] he preached the white horse rider was
[40:07] the Holy Ghost
[40:12] but then God revealed it
[40:16] and he got it in the right of that crime
[40:18] all right
[40:20] so let's just get started now let's go
[40:21] to Revelations six
[40:25] let's start on these
[40:27] things
[40:36] Revelation 6 1.
[40:40] I saw when the lamb opened one of the
[40:42] seals and I heard it where the noise of
[40:44] thunder
[40:45] one of the four beasts saying come and
[40:48] see
[40:50] all right
[40:52] one of the four bees
[40:56] I don't want to get that part we'll pick
[40:58] that up maybe later we'll but in the
[41:00] Thunder part of it we'll pick that up in
[41:02] the next Mexico really
[41:03] but the main thing I want you to see it
[41:05] was one of the Four B's
[41:08] he said well that was brother random one
[41:10] that's all right
[41:14] why don't just make it all the Four B's
[41:16] and forget it make it the Holy Spirit
[41:20] you're a hamburger bread
[41:24] they was in all of the ages coming down
[41:28] and that way you're not trying to make
[41:30] one or the other to try to prove a point
[41:32] because it's not going to prove any
[41:33] point
[41:35] look and I saw and behold of white horse
[41:38] he didn't sit on him had a bow and a
[41:40] Grandma's giving it to him and he went
[41:42] forth concrete and to conquer
[41:45] all right now brother Brown says go
[41:48] ahead brother
[41:49] look
[41:50] number one
[41:58] remember says it comes forth in a church
[42:01] symbol
[42:02] you get into all of this and everybody's
[42:04] arguing Thunders and voices and whatever
[42:07] but look
[42:08] let it come in a symbol
[42:12] that's the main thing I want you to
[42:14] think about
[42:15] and it came in a symbol
[42:18] a symbol was sent to the church
[42:21] okay
[42:23] we can argue about the voice and the
[42:25] Thunder and what this that
[42:27] a symbol
[42:29] they cannot be revealed until what he
[42:31] said here at the end time
[42:33] so it couldn't be made known down
[42:35] through there you read the first meal
[42:36] you'll hear the prophet saying these
[42:38] things
[42:39] there was no way for it to be known
[42:43] it was sent to the church as a symbol
[42:45] to keep her watching
[42:49] keep her studying
[42:54] then up watch when we get to it in a
[42:57] minute
[42:58] how could you write what's up there
[43:02] we're
[43:04] going to make a story on
[43:08] what if the Bible was written and it
[43:10] said
[43:12] the Antichrist
[43:15] will be Pope number so and so and so
[43:17] enjoy so much
[43:19] and his name will be so-and-so
[43:24] we'll never imagine this madness
[43:27] Presbyterian anybody could read the
[43:28] Bible
[43:30] let's say well we know who the
[43:31] Antichrist is
[43:34] but instead you got an interpretation
[43:38] from basically ever denomination
[43:42] about the Antichrist
[43:48] my brother-in-law is a Baptist preacher
[43:52] he said one day that Antichrist becomes
[43:54] it'll be a great big old Beast rise up
[43:57] alios
[43:59] I'm walking
[44:02] I said we're not going to deceive
[44:04] anybody
[44:08] yeah good brother
[44:11] that's what he thought
[44:14] no there's a Doctrine among organized
[44:17] religion and I never didn't understand
[44:18] Europe some of you maybe know more about
[44:20] it I'm sure than I do but it was to be a
[44:23] Syrian coming from somewhere certain
[44:25] country
[44:27] who's to be that
[44:30] for those that are believe in that are
[44:31] always looking for somebody from Syria
[44:35] you know this next folk comes from Syria
[44:39] that's him
[44:44] well
[44:47] you know
[44:50] I've always been one thing I believe in
[44:52] anchoring you feed into what's right but
[44:55] I never believed in paddling mud you
[44:58] know
[44:59] I believe in getting anchored
[45:03] and see you get your eyes set on looking
[45:04] for a certain thing
[45:08] what if it don't come that way
[45:13] they're teaching some in the message now
[45:15] that this pope now has got a dime get
[45:17] out of the way go to number so and so
[45:19] and so and so and so and so according to
[45:21] their records gonna be the last one
[45:26] well according to the Mayan calendar
[45:30] it's supposed to be the last year on the
[45:32] Earth
[45:39] but if you've checked into that and you
[45:41] know I read but I read a little bit of
[45:43] the fine print a lot of people read the
[45:45] front headlines and quit
[45:49] the Mayans had even things that spoke of
[45:52] later after this year
[45:58] and that's the kind of the way people
[46:00] are
[46:01] this next Pope coming up is supposed to
[46:03] be the one to bring the end of the world
[46:05] but just in case he's not we got a poke
[46:08] a second ago with third and fourth and
[46:10] fifth to come after him you know
[46:12] you know what I mean right right
[46:14] yeah but always got it figured out
[46:17] like a brother said they're in 63 he
[46:19] said
[46:21] what do you think about this Rapture
[46:22] coming in Easter Sunday Resurrection
[46:25] rapture
[46:27] 73.
[46:29] I mean 63 73 73.
[46:34] praise the Lord
[46:37] he said you sound like you don't blame
[46:39] it
[46:42] I said well we don't have anything by
[46:44] the prophet to say
[46:46] he said well
[46:48] said they do have it figured out if it
[46:50] don't come on Good Friday it'll come 40
[46:52] days later or something like that
[46:56] I know I mean you know what I said I
[46:58] said now sounds like you don't believe
[47:00] it
[47:01] no they already had 30 40 days left over
[47:04] just in case
[47:06] right
[47:07] that's what people do why don't you
[47:09] stand out there and say this is it
[47:11] that's right
[47:16] but people don't want you to say that
[47:20] they want you to have opinions
[47:23] I approved in 1974 that we could pass
[47:26] the year 2026 and not break right around
[47:29] this message
[47:32] but nobody wants to hear it why
[47:35] I said it
[47:37] but you know what we're here
[47:39] we passed it a long ways
[47:47] see if you know where he is you don't
[47:48] have to worry about it
[47:50] but if you don't then you're worried
[47:52] but see it was right in a symbol form
[47:56] to keep the church waiting
[48:02] a symbol of them
[48:04] Bible horse
[48:07] and a writer
[48:09] sitting on his back
[48:15] we thank it like running around and said
[48:16] in his early Ministry
[48:19] that it was like that
[48:21] he had a
[48:22] the Cupid Had a Little Bow and he's
[48:25] riding shooting the Holy Spirit was
[48:27] shooting
[48:28] the people you know the love
[48:33] but you know what
[48:38] it says there that he had a bow and
[48:40] didn't I know Iris
[48:41] so if that was Cupid he couldn't shoot
[48:44] too much
[48:47] right that's right see we don't think
[48:50] when we're reading
[48:52] the prophet didn't say that that was
[48:54] Cupid Shuffle Iris he was telling what
[48:57] other people believed right I don't
[49:00] think he ever did believe it was Cupid
[49:02] doing that
[49:04] thank you
[49:05] but what he believed it finally come out
[49:08] to the right thing
[49:09] all right
[49:11] but now look
[49:13] it's in a symbol form
[49:18] it's Satan he said
[49:21] changing his mask
[49:27] and he says you want me to tell you who
[49:29] this is
[49:32] he said it's the Antichrist
[49:34] he wouldn't pull nothing up bro let's
[49:36] see what is it
[49:40] okay number three
[49:45] number three let's look what he says
[49:47] that's
[49:49] paragraph 293 of the first seal
[49:53] all right and the second seal comes
[49:55] forth and goes around out into the end
[49:57] third seal kind of go down to N4 field
[49:59] six up one to about an end at the end
[50:02] time these books that's been rolled up
[50:04] all this time with these Mysteries into
[50:06] them is broken and out comes the mission
[50:09] to see what it is
[50:10] but actually we started Ford they
[50:13] started for it at the first church age
[50:18] I want you because the first church they
[50:21] received a message like this
[50:24] a white horse rider went out see who is
[50:26] he he's Mighty in his conquering power
[50:29] he is a great Feller in this talking
[50:31] power you want me to tell you who he is
[50:33] he's the Antichrist
[50:37] he said he started out
[50:40] in the first church age
[50:44] church that's what I don't understand
[50:45] why the people would turn off from me to
[50:48] speak and say that the actual
[50:50] manifestation of those things is to take
[50:53] place when we leave out of here
[50:56] when we see the greatest revelation of
[50:58] all
[51:01] we can see where the Antichrist started
[51:06] and now it's LED down to where it is
[51:12] what else would you want
[51:16] and to see that Antichrist as it starts
[51:18] as he's written there
[51:21] a white horse rider went out who is he
[51:23] signed the crowd he's minding his power
[51:25] was a great fell in his conquering power
[51:27] he only tell you who it is the
[51:28] Antichrist
[51:31] because you see if an antichrist Jesus
[51:34] said that the two would be so close
[51:36] together until it would deceive the very
[51:38] elected the right if it was possible
[51:41] Antichrist is the Antichrist spirit
[51:46] now go back and read the seal book first
[51:49] seal
[51:53] he never walked out there as a man
[51:57] the Antichrist
[52:00] now listen
[52:02] he's not a man
[52:12] it's a spirit
[52:13] that's right
[52:16] the spirit becomes incarnate
[52:19] in a man
[52:23] amen now you got his connection but he's
[52:26] a spirit to start with that's right
[52:30] they didn't go out in the first church
[52:32] age
[52:33] the Antichrist it didn't conquer that
[52:35] much it was conquered by the people who
[52:38] preached against it
[52:40] God is the spirit
[52:43] it's not to say a man
[52:46] all right
[52:47] let's just read these scriptures you
[52:48] know that John
[52:50] Little John saw the Antichrist
[52:53] you know that John's the only one that
[52:55] called it the Antichrist
[52:58] you know that Paul did as much as he saw
[53:00] never called it the Antichrist
[53:03] he called it Grievous wool
[53:07] he saw the spirit and what it was
[53:10] go ahead and pull up
[53:12] the scriptures
[53:14] John there
[53:16] but Paul never saw
[53:19] what John saw
[53:23] John went to Patmos and come back and
[53:25] wrote it
[53:27] all right
[53:29] now this in the Little John's
[53:33] The Book of John that John was the
[53:35] author of was written somewhere pretty
[53:38] close to 80 50.
[53:41] most everybody thinks of what Jesus was
[53:43] going along you know the disciples had a
[53:46] pen and a piece of paper
[53:48] yes
[53:53] just Regina she's reading the Bible
[53:56] she read so far she didn't sign that I
[53:59] don't know why she wanted me to sign
[54:00] she's reading it but that's what she
[54:02] wants so I signed it no okay
[54:05] if it's the show that she read the Bible
[54:06] and I signed it okay
[54:11] but listen Church
[54:16] that Antichrist spirit
[54:19] didn't start out as a man
[54:23] he was a spirit that's right
[54:27] the Pope
[54:29] that one day will be Satan incarnate
[54:34] the pope himself will not be the devil
[54:38] right
[54:39] amen you're just being the one that
[54:42] Satan is Incarnate in
[54:46] now so what does John called as I said
[54:49] Paul
[54:50] he said Grievous wolves
[54:52] John wrote in the Book of John
[54:55] about 80 50.
[54:57] he goes to Batman's around 1895-96
[55:02] he comes back writes the book of
[55:04] Revelation then he writes the
[55:07] the little Johns we call it
[55:10] first second third John he writes them
[55:13] after he comes back
[55:15] because he's seen the Antichrist
[55:21] he's seen it as a white righteous Church
[55:25] but Paul would only call it Grievous
[55:27] wolves because he was not chosen for
[55:29] that part
[55:30] but look like John we say with the
[55:32] Antichrist
[55:36] John 2 and 18 said little children
[55:39] it is the last time as you have heard
[55:42] the Antichrist shall come
[55:45] even now there are many Antichrist
[55:48] whereby we know that it is the last time
[55:53] there's many Antichrist
[56:00] now how did he know it was an antichrist
[56:06] look at the next one
[56:08] John 1 22. I joined first John 2 22.
[56:15] who is a liar
[56:18] but he that denied that Jesus
[56:21] is the Christ
[56:23] not was the Christ he is the Christ
[56:28] he is Antichrist
[56:30] that denied the father and the son
[56:35] you know I've had trinitarians to say if
[56:38] I deny the father I would deny the son
[56:40] if I don't believe in a trinity
[56:43] you ever talked to one had you say that
[56:45] to you using that verse scripture
[56:48] they say I can't deny the Trinity
[56:51] because I deny one of them because if I
[56:53] did not want on God the other one
[56:56] that's how deceiving it is but John
[56:59] calls it a liar
[57:03] a person that believes that
[57:06] Jesus is not the Christ
[57:10] is a liar
[57:12] he's already caught by an antichrist
[57:14] spirit
[57:17] that's right
[57:20] yet he thinks he's in the gospel
[57:23] look at the next one
[57:25] first John 4 and 3. in every spirit that
[57:28] confesses not that Jesus Christ
[57:31] is come in the flesh
[57:35] is not of God
[57:38] and this is that Spirit of antichrist
[57:44] whereof you have heard that it should
[57:47] come in even now already is it in the
[57:50] world
[57:54] now trinitarian Doctrine believes that
[57:57] Jesus Christ
[57:59] come in the flesh
[58:06] right
[58:07] that's a predator and Doctrine
[58:10] that Jesus Christ come in the flesh
[58:13] that he was here
[58:16] that's not scripture
[58:18] right
[58:20] you that denied that Jesus Christ is
[58:22] come in the flesh
[58:27] now that's right here today
[58:29] he is his present tense
[58:33] all right
[58:35] now
[58:37] look at the lights one second John 1 7
[58:40] for many deceivers are entered into the
[58:43] world
[58:44] who confess not that Jesus is come in
[58:47] the flesh
[58:48] this is a deceiver and an antichrist
[58:54] now John said the Antichrist was already
[58:56] dark
[59:01] but remember what the first sealed then
[59:04] when it would break
[59:07] it would show
[59:09] this horse and the rider
[59:13] run around say it's the Antichrist
[59:19] and it starts out
[59:21] I've got these on down through here but
[59:22] you need to see a book
[59:25] it starts out as a little Saiyan
[59:32] a Saiyan becomes a Doctrine
[59:37] a Doctrine becomes a law or a
[59:41] set of rules whatever you want to call
[59:42] it
[59:48] you know what caused
[59:50] came to kill Abel
[59:57] it was his Doctrine
[1:00:01] okay
[1:00:03] because he was rejected
[1:00:06] as to his sacrifice
[1:00:08] made him highly upset
[1:00:12] that was his deed
[1:00:15] he offered what he thought God
[1:00:20] worked like everything to bring forth
[1:00:28] his little thing his little thoughts in
[1:00:30] his mind his little saying little
[1:00:32] you know
[1:00:37] he put it into a deed
[1:00:41] he went out and
[1:00:44] gathered all in the fruit made a
[1:00:48] beautiful offering
[1:00:52] but then he jumped onto able about it
[1:01:00] because God had told us it came
[1:01:03] if you had done like your brother
[1:01:05] you have been received
[1:01:10] his deed his Saiyan become a deed his
[1:01:14] deed become a Doctrine
[1:01:16] and that's where you'll find a second
[1:01:18] seal when we get to it
[1:01:22] or the red horse rider
[1:01:28] he went out and killed Cain because of
[1:01:30] his Doctrine
[1:01:35] am I right amen
[1:01:38] because God rejected what he's done
[1:01:41] when did he get mad at God
[1:01:47] no
[1:01:49] we ain't gonna do that
[1:01:54] to his Doctrine caused him to kill
[1:01:57] right
[1:02:02] there's plenty of people in this message
[1:02:04] now I'm going to say the way I believe
[1:02:06] it right there's plenty of people in
[1:02:08] this message would like to shut me up
[1:02:10] I don't mean they want to kill me I
[1:02:12] ain't saying somebody wants to they can
[1:02:14] ring in that and kill you and cut your
[1:02:15] throat because Cain didn't want to do
[1:02:17] that start with
[1:02:19] it
[1:02:21] had to be that Satan become incarnate in
[1:02:25] Cain
[1:02:26] you agree amen right when there's
[1:02:30] thoughts and his ideas
[1:02:31] that was his blood brother
[1:02:34] because they were two different Bloods
[1:02:36] that's all right
[1:02:37] same mama
[1:02:42] but it become so straight
[1:02:46] until Cain
[1:02:49] finally killed his brother
[1:02:55] that's your Antichrist
[1:02:57] you ever notice it run around says
[1:02:59] everything started in Genesis
[1:03:03] he said all these doctrines started in
[1:03:06] Genesis
[1:03:09] now that's something ain't it Methodist
[1:03:11] Baptist Presbyterian randomize a little
[1:03:15] ice who the eyes or wherever you want to
[1:03:17] go
[1:03:21] we have a doctor in this contrary to
[1:03:23] God's word it surely didn't begin in
[1:03:24] heaven
[1:03:29] the prophecy to be gone in the garden
[1:03:32] right
[1:03:36] you see anything that denies that Jesus
[1:03:38] Christ has now come into flesh
[1:03:41] now if you think I ain't right find you
[1:03:43] a trinitarian and tell him that
[1:03:47] and ask him do you think Jesus Christ is
[1:03:49] now in flesh
[1:03:55] brother you're crazy
[1:03:57] so I'm not talking about a human mortal
[1:03:59] standing there Jesus I'm talking about
[1:04:01] living in you
[1:04:04] well now in a way
[1:04:07] run
[1:04:10] I guess you could say that
[1:04:13] but let's don't go too far now
[1:04:15] we make too much out of ourselves
[1:04:17] thank you
[1:04:20] I don't think we went far enough
[1:04:25] I used to like brother most definition
[1:04:27] of a lot of things I love this one
[1:04:32] you said you can't sin enough to be lost
[1:04:35] all right
[1:04:37] if you're born again
[1:04:41] you can't say enough to be lost
[1:04:43] I like that
[1:04:46] then you turn around say yeah but if you
[1:04:48] ever if you're saved you ain't gonna be
[1:04:50] well
[1:04:52] you ain't getting the point either
[1:04:55] but listen
[1:04:56] okay
[1:04:57] never spirit
[1:05:01] isn't that Spirit one of you agree
[1:05:04] that the new birth in your heart
[1:05:09] is the baptism of the Holy Ghost is like
[1:05:11] Jesus said it all right
[1:05:13] it's an antichrist spirit
[1:05:22] you remember I told you about the man
[1:05:24] that Jeff that time was oh man Alberta
[1:05:26] Brown was deity
[1:05:29] I said well brother I believe in deity
[1:05:33] I guess he thought he had him a good
[1:05:34] convert
[1:05:35] but
[1:05:37] I said now take it apart the fact that
[1:05:40] brother Reynold was a prophet and the
[1:05:41] gifts and the sons the things that went
[1:05:43] with his life I said separate that part
[1:05:47] I said brother Brown had the baptism
[1:05:48] when the Holy Ghost you agree he said
[1:05:50] yes I said well I believe in that being
[1:05:52] God in him but I said this brother right
[1:05:54] here if he's got the baptism with the
[1:05:57] Holy Ghost I said that's deity also
[1:06:01] he said no I don't agree with you
[1:06:04] what's that
[1:06:06] glad you I was talking to a person who
[1:06:08] believed right around was God
[1:06:10] right
[1:06:11] see I believe ever born again Christian
[1:06:14] remember said it was deity speaking
[1:06:16] right right
[1:06:18] look at that
[1:06:21] but you see it's all in the way you say
[1:06:23] nice
[1:06:25] he doesn't believeth that Jesus Christ
[1:06:27] is come in the flesh is of God
[1:06:34] with he that denied that Jesus Christ
[1:06:36] has come into flesh is an antichrist
[1:06:41] see now watch what I'm saying
[1:06:43] at the time he started out
[1:06:48] he had no horse to ride
[1:06:52] you remember it says that there was one
[1:06:54] horse
[1:06:54] he'd sit on him you know
[1:06:57] but in his beginning he didn't have a
[1:06:58] horse to be able to ride it was just a
[1:07:01] spirit
[1:07:03] it's the spirit among the people
[1:07:09] after a while you connect on over
[1:07:13] that we got
[1:07:15] it becomes from a
[1:07:18] Antichrist spirit
[1:07:22] you come to a prophet
[1:07:30] come on
[1:07:33] you've read you see a book and
[1:07:36] to a prophet now not talking about a
[1:07:37] true prophet
[1:07:41] a prophet is one who teaches a message
[1:07:44] or a Doctrine
[1:07:46] see that Antichrist spirit
[1:07:49] it says it and he had a bow and no
[1:07:53] errors
[1:07:56] right right
[1:07:58] the bluff the prophet said
[1:08:00] all right
[1:08:01] and what did it say about him
[1:08:07] he that set upon him in a bowl and a
[1:08:10] crown was given him
[1:08:14] you can't Crown the spirit
[1:08:17] that's right
[1:08:19] right
[1:08:21] it's going to be coming the next stage
[1:08:23] of understanding
[1:08:25] he became a false prophet
[1:08:31] that's where he got his crown
[1:08:38] you just started out teaching it
[1:08:41] making Bishops and making all kind of
[1:08:43] things that's why I said it I really
[1:08:45] enjoyed the church age book
[1:08:47] because I could follow a chain of those
[1:08:49] things
[1:08:52] but there he was
[1:08:54] a prophet
[1:08:56] our people begin to take that Doctrine
[1:09:01] and they begin to preach it
[1:09:05] here's where the people miss it stood in
[1:09:07] the seal book
[1:09:09] but Arundel mentioned it he says
[1:09:11] Antichrist
[1:09:12] Prophet Beast
[1:09:16] they don't listen careful enough then to
[1:09:18] keep reading until he says it this way
[1:09:20] to make it right Antichrist prophet
[1:09:24] incarnate folks brother
[1:09:27] that's in the seal book
[1:09:29] he said then he becomes the Beast
[1:09:31] I've got a quote laying up here then
[1:09:33] when he first started out he couldn't be
[1:09:34] the Beast
[1:09:39] you can only be an antichrist
[1:09:44] you see the revealing of Jesus Christ
[1:09:46] shows us who the Antichrist is
[1:09:48] Jesus Christ he has come in the flesh by
[1:09:51] the new birth right
[1:09:55] Satan denies that wants to make it the
[1:09:57] second person or something
[1:10:00] right yeah that's right
[1:10:05] but did he become a prophet down through
[1:10:07] the time you read the seal book and see
[1:10:08] if I'm right
[1:10:10] you become a prophet
[1:10:12] that began to preach his message
[1:10:16] you know Satan's got a five-fold
[1:10:18] Ministry
[1:10:19] hmm
[1:10:24] you didn't know that
[1:10:27] and they can be transformed even as the
[1:10:30] scripture says
[1:10:31] angels of life
[1:10:39] now he's got his own faithful Ministry
[1:10:43] and he began to send it out teaching
[1:10:45] teaches Doctrine
[1:10:48] and after a while they become so
[1:10:50] connected to that Doctrine they become
[1:10:52] one with it to become a prophet of that
[1:10:54] system
[1:11:00] Same Spirit
[1:11:03] begins to pick up then and come into the
[1:11:05] stage of Incarnate false prophet
[1:11:09] nurse when you Pope comes in
[1:11:14] do you know it didn't start out with a
[1:11:16] pope by turning the time of tall there
[1:11:18] was no Pope
[1:11:20] you call them Grievous wolves
[1:11:25] come on read yourself book I'm in the
[1:11:27] cell message I'm bringing it right out
[1:11:28] of the boat
[1:11:32] he becoming incarnate false prophet
[1:11:36] that's when he got his crown
[1:11:40] a triple ruling crown of Rome right
[1:11:46] when you become an incarnate false
[1:11:48] prophet an antichrist incarnate a spirit
[1:11:52] becomes incarnate
[1:11:56] he started out in the ages
[1:12:01] as just being a little saying a little
[1:12:03] Doctrine then if it started from a
[1:12:05] saying to a doctrine of mankind and they
[1:12:08] become a preacher to that Doctrine
[1:12:11] prophets of that Doctrine
[1:12:15] but then one day he got a crown
[1:12:22] they're coming in according to false
[1:12:24] prophet
[1:12:26] you see one day that same Antichrist
[1:12:28] spirit
[1:12:29] will finally turn out to be the Beast
[1:12:36] we'll see you and I
[1:12:40] see what I'm so happy about the way that
[1:12:42] I believe
[1:12:44] because I can look back there
[1:12:47] and see what that Prophet said
[1:12:51] and I can watch that spirit
[1:12:54] and I look around the people in the
[1:12:56] message especially the ministry
[1:13:00] you see good honest-hearted sincere
[1:13:03] preacher
[1:13:05] but you see little doctor and little
[1:13:07] Saiyans
[1:13:09] we've had them to come right here right
[1:13:15] and when I questioned a brother later
[1:13:17] and told him I didn't agree he said well
[1:13:19] you know people preach that and I just
[1:13:21] believed it
[1:13:24] um
[1:13:27] you remember
[1:13:30] you remember about the Judah and the
[1:13:31] Tamar they were trying to preach
[1:13:34] now that was a great lineage to come
[1:13:36] down
[1:13:39] and Judah planted his seed into Tamar to
[1:13:43] save her
[1:13:45] I told him I said that'd make sex a
[1:13:47] savior and I don't agree with it
[1:13:51] I said seed went Blended in our savior
[1:13:54] well you better be careful because that
[1:13:56] same seed in there produced winds
[1:13:59] right
[1:14:01] one of them was forever right but I said
[1:14:03] come down to David
[1:14:05] the other one I can't remember his name
[1:14:06] you know where it went it went to Aiken
[1:14:09] you remember that with the Babylonian
[1:14:11] garment that's where the other line went
[1:14:14] to
[1:14:15] but you see
[1:14:17] it was a saying
[1:14:19] it just sound good
[1:14:23] well all the big preachers are preaching
[1:14:25] it
[1:14:27] oh my
[1:14:30] you remember the story I told you about
[1:14:32] the brother preaching it
[1:14:36] they brought around was the one to come
[1:14:38] to General Patton
[1:14:43] and I just told him I said don't believe
[1:14:45] it but
[1:14:47] amen
[1:14:48] I still believe it was the Lord Jesus
[1:14:50] Christ that done the brother animal path
[1:14:52] he said yeah but it's got to be an angel
[1:14:53] that's who it was the angel of the Lord
[1:14:55] Jesus Christ the prophet
[1:15:00] what you see his point was
[1:15:03] that's what people preach
[1:15:07] these four brothers overseas
[1:15:11] you at least got the tapes in the books
[1:15:13] to check out Honeys with
[1:15:15] these four brothers that come from
[1:15:16] overseas like the brother stood here to
[1:15:18] Wednesday night and said we only got
[1:15:19] about 200 messages
[1:15:21] in our language
[1:15:25] well
[1:15:28] and then people go over there you know
[1:15:30] when I went to the Philippines you know
[1:15:32] what used to be the biggest Doctrine in
[1:15:33] the Philippines was a two Soul Doctrine
[1:15:40] well they had no way to contradict that
[1:15:42] Doctrine
[1:15:44] until God allowed books and tapes to
[1:15:47] come their way
[1:15:49] see it's a saying you get it Antichrist
[1:15:53] spirit
[1:15:55] it starts out as a spirit not as a man
[1:16:00] starts out as a spirit a little saying
[1:16:03] that's why I come here every once in a
[1:16:05] while clip things
[1:16:08] you know say something about things
[1:16:11] he said oh
[1:16:13] you don't got that brother sincere
[1:16:16] I guess he asked me sincerely wrong for
[1:16:18] it I'm concerned
[1:16:22] when they start bringing out stuff like
[1:16:24] that
[1:16:24] and I'm Pastor I'm supposed to correct
[1:16:26] those times
[1:16:28] oh but you remember a spirit got onto
[1:16:31] some people
[1:16:32] you show you how good a spirit can get
[1:16:34] on people
[1:16:35] you know that Moses stood there one day
[1:16:37] and said I was on God's side come over
[1:16:39] here yeah
[1:16:42] 250 priests with sisters in their hands
[1:16:46] off of the fire of the altar fell in the
[1:16:49] ground preacher right
[1:16:52] right the next day
[1:16:55] right
[1:16:58] come on read your Bible the next day
[1:17:01] they come to Moses and said you kill the
[1:17:05] people of God that's right right
[1:17:09] do you think that doctor hadn't hung on
[1:17:13] you think that Spirit hasn't gotten them
[1:17:15] people it was on the same ones that
[1:17:17] wasn't the ground I believe I'd at least
[1:17:19] waited three days
[1:17:22] you know
[1:17:24] maybe a week yeah
[1:17:27] but the next day
[1:17:31] that's right see I know in first journey
[1:17:34] I know the truth about what people are
[1:17:35] and the way they think
[1:17:38] there's somebody right here
[1:17:40] different from me for him to be him and
[1:17:42] they already said it were
[1:17:44] and fell over digging
[1:17:46] 50 percent of you would believe I was
[1:17:48] wrong
[1:17:56] well brother Dale
[1:17:58] well you want to make it 51.
[1:18:04] brother Dale that's a good brother
[1:18:07] ain't no problems about good Brothers
[1:18:12] Robin Hood
[1:18:14] Rob the rich gave the poor
[1:18:20] what good does that mean
[1:18:23] it wouldn't have been much profit in
[1:18:24] robbing the poor to probably give him
[1:18:25] the poor I think you're smart
[1:18:28] I'm gonna get my point
[1:18:31] my spirit gets among people
[1:18:34] I watch it here I see Spirit brother
[1:18:37] told me one day brother Wendy from here
[1:18:39] never had been here
[1:18:41] and didn't know the person
[1:18:44] we were standing outside and he looked
[1:18:46] at me and he said brother Dale that
[1:18:48] man's trying to bust up your church
[1:18:52] so what I know all about it
[1:18:56] you better get out there
[1:19:02] they worried about it
[1:19:05] do we want to eat the brother told me
[1:19:07] again
[1:19:10] he said I'd rather shine a bust your
[1:19:13] church up
[1:19:16] I should watch it and I'll show you
[1:19:18] I get up I walk over and I sit down
[1:19:21] Lee immediately the conversation stopped
[1:19:28] I walk out here a lot of times and I see
[1:19:30] you talking and I just walk around
[1:19:34] and I just stop
[1:19:38] the conversation changes
[1:19:42] you think I don't know
[1:19:47] what you see
[1:19:49] I'm still trying to be Christ
[1:19:52] because I know it's just a spirit
[1:19:55] it is among you
[1:19:59] I know a lot of spirits come in here and
[1:20:01] get among the people
[1:20:02] and I watched that very closely
[1:20:07] which is me when I do come out and say
[1:20:09] something about it
[1:20:11] you offended that person
[1:20:17] it's the same people that said you
[1:20:19] killed a big blue God
[1:20:23] see what an antichrist is
[1:20:26] can we look at an antichrist and run
[1:20:28] around and say a white horse and a rider
[1:20:30] and an antichrist it was a spirit that
[1:20:32] started among the people
[1:20:38] now you want another good illustration
[1:20:40] of a spirit of an antichrist
[1:20:43] why was Lucifer cast out in heaven
[1:20:53] come on as long as he casting out of
[1:20:56] heaven
[1:21:00] he had a saying that a bunch of angels
[1:21:03] picked up
[1:21:04] and they believed it
[1:21:10] right
[1:21:13] and they believed Satan's saying
[1:21:19] and when it become a Doctrine
[1:21:23] he'd become to an issue
[1:21:27] and Michael had to cast him out
[1:21:32] right
[1:21:34] because Michael was Christ see Gabriel
[1:21:36] couldn't handle it prevent Brooklyn
[1:21:38] Daniel
[1:21:40] might try to come to Daniel
[1:21:43] through Gabriel and he couldn't get that
[1:21:45] Ricky bubble
[1:21:50] 23 days or 21 days or something
[1:21:53] that he was hindered
[1:21:57] he said until Michael your friends
[1:22:00] came to my Aid in other words and when
[1:22:02] he did now I'm able to come on here
[1:22:04] because Gabriel couldn't handle
[1:22:07] Lucifer
[1:22:10] look Michael came
[1:22:13] and who is Michael
[1:22:15] he's Christ
[1:22:18] who is this we're talking about
[1:22:21] the revelation of Jesus Christ is what
[1:22:23] cast The Devil out that's right
[1:22:25] now come on
[1:22:29] you know yourself as I said a moment ago
[1:22:31] you see preachers that after 40 years
[1:22:33] they're still preaching higher dress
[1:22:35] closing
[1:22:38] brother Dale you don't live in preaching
[1:22:40] higher addressing love I don't believe
[1:22:41] it's the way most preachers I don't I
[1:22:44] don't believe it's salvation I believe
[1:22:45] you can have a dress dragging the ground
[1:22:47] and you're higher running off and
[1:22:49] dragging your tracks out and still be as
[1:22:51] dead and sincere of a devil has ever
[1:22:53] been
[1:22:56] but if God is in the heart
[1:22:59] your heart might not be that long
[1:23:02] but when you don't cut it
[1:23:04] that's what it means in the Bible
[1:23:08] is 40 foot long higher and you take an
[1:23:12] eighth of an inch off
[1:23:15] that's good
[1:23:17] right
[1:23:18] a long higher
[1:23:23] is the scissors has never been in it
[1:23:27] you African people your heart doesn't
[1:23:28] grow long does it
[1:23:30] come on
[1:23:33] what you see
[1:23:35] a little saying
[1:23:37] a little Doctrine
[1:23:40] don't you think brother Dale's kind of
[1:23:42] out of a bad attitude seemed like lately
[1:23:44] he's been real harsh mean and takes a
[1:23:48] lot of hard things to us
[1:23:57] what if that's the Holy Ghost
[1:24:00] s
[1:24:07] what if the Holy Ghost is telling me
[1:24:09] make it hard and strong
[1:24:14] can you eat it
[1:24:19] see a spirit
[1:24:21] that Antichrist is still right here
[1:24:23] any word you see Jesus Christ now hope
[1:24:26] of Illustrated with Michael and stuff
[1:24:29] like that enough for you to see any time
[1:24:31] you see a spirit
[1:24:32] he's trying to turn you against the
[1:24:34] truth
[1:24:39] just as a little saying
[1:24:47] all I got to do is say
[1:24:49] you know you do this and you get in
[1:24:51] trouble over the time
[1:24:52] I say brother dick
[1:24:54] watch brother Carly got it gets get off
[1:24:56] forget it I should have said that I
[1:24:59] should have said that really I should
[1:25:01] have said that
[1:25:09] that's all it takes
[1:25:12] the rest of the day brother Dick's going
[1:25:14] around watch brother call he got against
[1:25:16] me
[1:25:17] a week later he said watch brother call
[1:25:19] he got against me then one day he walks
[1:25:21] up said what do you got against me
[1:25:26] right
[1:25:31] the spirit
[1:25:35] so the easy the end of Christ here
[1:25:41] don't you think that brother Abraham is
[1:25:44] deity
[1:25:49] well you know if you're getting dressed
[1:25:51] order
[1:25:52] but but brother don't you think that
[1:25:54] he's just a little bit above us
[1:26:03] I think he's a member of the body of
[1:26:05] Christ right amen I think he was God's
[1:26:07] messenger brought to us all right that's
[1:26:09] true but as far as a human in the body
[1:26:11] of Christ he's no different all right
[1:26:14] you will not be set upon a pedestal come
[1:26:16] on
[1:26:17] because of him just being born again
[1:26:19] he'll be set up on a pedestal and
[1:26:21] honored because of the gifts in his life
[1:26:23] and because he yielded himself to those
[1:26:25] things but he's no different than anyone
[1:26:27] else in the body of Christ
[1:26:29] said there's no big eyes and little u's
[1:26:37] that's what I've always said and I love
[1:26:39] that scripture the least in the kingdom
[1:26:41] of God
[1:26:43] is greater than John the Baptist that's
[1:26:45] Bible
[1:26:48] yeah look what honor we give to John of
[1:26:51] the introducing of the Messiah
[1:26:54] which is the only thing just a little
[1:26:56] sayings
[1:26:58] I've told you you go back and read and
[1:27:00] see if I'm right the first night seeing
[1:27:03] Council of 325 A.D was not was not now
[1:27:07] read it if you don't I'll get you to
[1:27:08] vote it's in your computer run over
[1:27:10] there where it says the United fathers
[1:27:13] and pre-nicity and father
[1:27:16] the First nassian Council was not an
[1:27:18] argument over whether they was one God
[1:27:20] or three
[1:27:25] it was over whether or not Jesus was the
[1:27:30] substance or a light substance
[1:27:33] and their first Nicene Council statement
[1:27:38] come on
[1:27:40] I haven't seen these and read it I
[1:27:41] wouldn't have believed it was God their
[1:27:43] first statement was from the Nicene
[1:27:45] Council Jesus is almighty God
[1:27:52] that's their first statement
[1:27:55] but you see then that little saying got
[1:27:57] started
[1:27:59] by the time they come to 606
[1:28:02] then they begin to develop
[1:28:05] a trinity
[1:28:08] from the fact of saying that Jesus was
[1:28:11] not the substance of God
[1:28:13] he was a light substance
[1:28:15] making him a demon god
[1:28:19] which means the Lesser God
[1:28:22] it took 600 years to get that saying to
[1:28:26] become a Doctrine
[1:28:28] that's how deceiving it is
[1:28:34] read your first seal
[1:28:38] he went from a deed to a Doctrine
[1:28:45] to a governmental form in other words
[1:28:46] men
[1:28:48] and then it went to an incarnate
[1:28:51] false prophet in the Pope
[1:28:54] and one day Satan will be incarnate in
[1:28:58] the Beast
[1:29:00] well that's your four stages
[1:29:05] of your Antichrist
[1:29:07] but what I love is on the other side
[1:29:13] the four stages what are the bug that
[1:29:15] made it down four stages brought it back
[1:29:18] justification under Luther
[1:29:19] sanctification on the west Pentecostal
[1:29:21] baptism when the Holy Ghost
[1:29:23] and then the word
[1:29:27] the word through the prophet
[1:29:29] to tell you the deception of these
[1:29:32] things
[1:29:34] now close it can be
[1:29:38] thinking on these things come on brother
[1:29:40] remember that's an argument communities
[1:29:42] fixing it let's just stand and sing a
[1:29:45] little song if anybody has a need we
[1:29:47] don't want to have it
[1:29:50] be unless
[1:29:53] you know there's nobody has a need we
[1:29:56] want to do that
[1:29:57] let's just sing a little M or something
[1:29:59] I love him you have a name
[1:30:04] go into the community
[1:30:12] First
[1:30:14] Love Me
