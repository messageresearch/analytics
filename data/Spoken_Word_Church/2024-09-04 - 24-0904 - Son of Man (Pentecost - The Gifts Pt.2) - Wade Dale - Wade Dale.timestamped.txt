[18:34] in Jesus name amen we're on the uh son
[18:38] of man we're talking about the day of
[18:41] Pentecost 1906 Aza Street and this will
[18:45] be the gifts part two so let's go to the
[18:48] Book of Joel Joel 228 said it shall come
[18:50] to pass afterward that I'll pour out my
[18:53] spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and
[18:56] your daughters shall prophesy now
[18:58] remember
[18:59] this is after the bugs already eat
[19:01] everything down he's going to restore
[19:02] all this and he's going to bring
[19:03] everything back and he's going to do it
[19:06] by listen there's a lot of spirits out
[19:08] there but listen you and I should be
[19:10] acquainted with the Holy
[19:13] One all right everybody with me there's
[19:15] many spirits out there but there's only
[19:17] one Holy Spirit and it acts different
[19:21] than any other Spirit you've ever seen
[19:23] in your life all right cuz it's holy and
[19:25] it's perfect so just remember that I'll
[19:28] pour out my Spirit upon All Flesh and
[19:29] your sons and your daughters shall
[19:31] prophesy your old men will dream dreams
[19:33] your young men shall see visions and
[19:35] also upon the servants and the handmaids
[19:37] in those days will I pour out my spirit
[19:39] you may be seated in the Lord by his
[19:41] Blessing to the reading of the
[19:43] word Acts 2
[19:46] verse1 in the Bible this is when the
[19:48] Holy Ghost falls for the first time on a
[19:51] group of people to make them Sons and
[19:54] Daughters of God are are are
[19:56] bride you know I thinking today
[20:00] that began the Genesis 1 126
[20:02] man all right most you Bible readers
[20:05] know what God back in the beginning in
[20:07] Genesis 1 he said let us make man our
[20:10] own image that wasn't all mankind that
[20:12] was his children that was his progeny
[20:16] and guess what brother Donnie we've come
[20:19] to the almost to the very end of all
[20:21] that being
[20:24] fulfilled all the Genesis 126 people
[20:27] that are on the Earth right now is it
[20:30] there's not another generation there's
[20:31] not another church to rise up this is it
[20:34] the ones that have gone on that is what
[20:36] they're they're in that sixth Dimension
[20:38] that is that Genesis 126 man that
[20:40] theophany of God that he imparted on the
[20:43] day of Pentecost 120 times right and
[20:46] then 3,000 times downstairs and you when
[20:49] you became born again so you fulfilled
[20:53] that Genesis I just Ryan I'm back to
[20:55] cutting grass and preaching again so I
[20:58] was doing that today and I thought you
[21:00] know that Genesis 126 man we preached on
[21:02] it so long till there's a large group of
[21:05] people in that Genesis 126 which is the
[21:07] Bride of Jesus Christ the ones that Rees
[21:09] the new birth not just an anointing the
[21:11] new birth not foolish
[21:14] virgin I'll I'll amen myself
[21:18] amen so but now brother Aaron we're down
[21:21] here at this very end of all this stuff
[21:23] of all this Genesis when he said let us
[21:25] make man in our image we're down to the
[21:27] very end because look when the last one
[21:29] comes in it's the one he saw before the
[21:31] foundation of the world and that closes
[21:33] up that Genesis
[21:34] 126 that's the whole theophany of God
[21:37] that he wanted to pour out on the day of
[21:40] Pentecost and now in isza Street 1906
[21:43] and now tonight if you'll ask him
[21:45] to all right problem is sometimes we get
[21:48] scared of
[21:50] spirits you should be scared of spirits
[21:53] except the Holy One right we'll talk
[21:56] about that in just a few minutes
[21:58] cuz we got to learn we got to learn
[22:01] to let me put it this way we're going to
[22:03] have to learn as a church and as a body
[22:05] to handle the Holy
[22:08] Spirit we got to learn to handle it okay
[22:11] everybody with
[22:13] me so when the day of Pentecost was
[22:15] fully come now this is this is 2,000
[22:18] years ago in ad30 just as when Jesus
[22:20] left the Earth he said go and wait until
[22:24] be you be endued with power from on high
[22:27] and pent Pentecost was Penta means five
[22:31] all right so on the 50th day after the
[22:34] Passover which Jesus was killed on the
[22:36] Passover cuz he was the Passover
[22:41] Lamb I believe this if y'all don't and
[22:44] when the day of Pentecost was fully come
[22:46] so that was the 50th day he said go
[22:48] Terry until you be endued with power
[22:51] from on high not from power from
[22:53] anywhere else power from Caiaphas or or
[22:56] any of those people on the Earth it came
[22:58] from what on high all right and suddenly
[23:01] there came a sound from Heaven as a
[23:02] rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all
[23:05] the house where they were sitting and
[23:07] there appeared unto them clothing
[23:08] tongues like as of fire and it set upon
[23:10] each of them and they were all filled
[23:12] with the Holy Ghost and began to speak
[23:14] with other tongues as the spirit gave
[23:17] them utterance and if you um what we
[23:20] were dwelling on this this past weekend
[23:23] was
[23:25] it's Pentecost Pentecostal
[23:29] experiences or denominations depend on
[23:31] the
[23:33] speaking that's right now on the day of
[23:35] Pentecost it was all in the
[23:37] hearing everybody with me Faith doesn't
[23:40] come by speaking in
[23:41] tongues where there's tongues they'll
[23:43] ceas hello where there's prophecy
[23:46] they'll
[23:47] cease
[23:49] right it was the hearing they heard each
[23:52] other in their own language what a
[23:55] miracle it would be if if we had you
[23:57] know four or five e ethnic group sitting
[23:59] here today that didn't speak English but
[24:01] all of a sudden I'm here speaking
[24:02] there's nobody interpreting and they're
[24:04] saying amen just as soon as you do
[24:07] that's the miracle of hearing the word
[24:09] of God in your own language cuz you know
[24:12] what let me let you in a little secret
[24:14] for eternity that's the way you're going
[24:16] to hear
[24:18] God that's right believe that we won't
[24:21] need an interpreter over there but I'll
[24:24] speak in English and if you spoke
[24:25] English here I believe you'll be able to
[24:27] hear me but if someone is we have our
[24:29] Hispanic Brethren they'll say Amen just
[24:32] as soon as they y'all say amen amen I
[24:34] just believe that cuz it's in the
[24:36] hearing not in the speaking so faith
[24:39] comes by hearing but that's why they put
[24:41] a lot of emphasis on the gifts and I'll
[24:44] read you a little commentary maybe this
[24:45] later
[24:47] tonight where it the speaking in tongues
[24:50] comes from from the lips coming out and
[24:53] and there's something that
[24:56] changes you know you think about a lot
[25:00] things but if you don't speak it how's
[25:03] it going to come to pass
[25:06] right remember brother B said what it
[25:09] was a thought God had a thought
[25:11] first then that thought developed into a
[25:14] word well you know what God's got a
[25:19] tongue shocker God's a
[25:22] man he's not a thing he's a
[25:27] man and he has a tongue he has a brain
[25:31] better than ours a tongue better than
[25:34] ours eyes better than ours but he were
[25:37] we were made in His image so you're
[25:39] looking at the image of God sitting here
[25:41] tonight right God wasn't a monkey god
[25:44] wasn't a bear God wasn't a leopard God
[25:46] was a man you know why I know God was a
[25:49] man cuz when the first person first
[25:51] thing he made that was human was a human
[25:53] mortal man that looked just like
[25:57] him and that's what sons and daughters
[25:59] are doing now we're being born as we
[26:01] were talking about Sunday by the Breath
[26:03] of God but it's not changing our outside
[26:05] form it's IMM morphing us IM inm morphy
[26:09] or moving changing our form back to that
[26:12] image that we were before listen Jesus
[26:14] Christ looked 50 years old on the
[26:17] earth he was only 30 we know that but he
[26:20] looked 50 everybody with me but what was
[26:23] inside of that man was that young guyy
[26:26] God has never been an old man
[26:29] right I don't serve a God that can't get
[26:31] up out of a
[26:33] chair
[26:34] hello that's hard for me to do but how
[26:38] many depictions of God have you saw as a
[26:41] young
[26:42] boy
[26:45] none think of it every time God is
[26:48] depicted it's an old gray-headed man
[26:50] with a cane or some kind of something it
[26:52] looks like he's all kind of feeble no my
[26:54] God's young always been Young Forever is
[26:57] he young amen you know why because you
[26:59] and I are going to be forever we're
[27:01] going to be young we might have to come
[27:03] down here and develop in our sin body
[27:06] and what I was talking about Sunday in
[27:08] this body cast that we're
[27:11] in but inside of this guy tonight you
[27:14] see there is a young boy about 18 to 20
[27:17] years
[27:18] old am that's right well I'm going to
[27:23] buy me an amen recorder
[27:28] our sister may not know whether y'all
[27:30] believe it or not y'all not saying
[27:31] nobody saying
[27:35] amen it's don't strike your heart
[27:37] nothing else
[27:39] will you just sitting here like a bump
[27:41] on a
[27:42] pickle you know what a bump on a
[27:44] Pickle's worth not a whole
[27:46] lot they're only there to hold
[27:49] it so anyway on the day of Pentecost
[27:53] think about that on the day of Pentecost
[27:58] there was a sound of a mighty rushing
[28:00] wind it was a holy spirit that went into
[28:02] the people and what did it do it made
[28:05] them act like holy
[28:07] people all right everybody with me so if
[28:10] that's what happened on the day of
[28:11] Pentecost here then guess what God
[28:14] doesn't change he's the same he never
[28:17] does change thank God he's the only
[28:19] person that don't change his mind so you
[28:22] come down here to the end time to the
[28:24] lay out of sin Church age and he does
[28:26] the same identical thing he's starts it
[28:29] with a gift of speaking in tongues or a
[28:31] gift of Prophecy and we you know we when
[28:34] we read that about the isusa street
[28:36] there was a lot done with the tongues
[28:38] and interpretations but there was a lot
[28:40] of Miracles there was a lot of of uh
[28:42] wisdom and and all those different
[28:44] things that came into the church if
[28:45] you'll read those um that sister and
[28:48] older brother that they did the
[28:50] interview in on YouTube they'll tell you
[28:52] there was gifts every everywhere there
[28:54] was just gifts working all over the
[28:55] place everybody was in love and
[28:57] everything was just hunky dory and they
[28:59] were black white green purple and all
[29:01] other kind of people there I don't know
[29:02] about the green ones but or the purple
[29:05] ones either but there was people of all
[29:07] the nations come to Asuza to get under
[29:10] that an anointing of the Holy
[29:12] Ghost now listen some just got
[29:17] anointed cuz they proved it but some got
[29:21] the real true Holy Ghost and moved on
[29:23] with it and that's what you and I need
[29:25] to do today we need to get a refreshing
[29:28] to know that we have the Holy Ghost cuz
[29:30] I'm going to read you here in just a
[29:31] little while where the Bible tells us to
[29:34] grieve not the holy spirit of God
[29:36] whereby you are sealed to the day of
[29:37] your Redemption so you can grieve it
[29:39] brother R I'll read you about six quotes
[29:42] he said God's timid he said the Holy
[29:44] Ghost is timid he said don't
[29:47] move he said have everything in order he
[29:50] said because if you don't the holy
[29:51] spirit will leave all right we think man
[29:54] he's just this real rugged guy no he
[29:56] makes you rugged right he makes you
[29:59] rugged when he goes inside of you he
[30:01] makes you rugged he makes you bald ain't
[30:03] that what he done with Peter and them on
[30:05] the day of Pentecost it made them
[30:09] bold so
[30:12] Jesus you know we read the Bible in
[30:16] Daniel thinking about this a few minutes
[30:18] ago says by his knowledge in Isaiah 53
[30:21] he who who Jesus Christ shall my
[30:23] righteous servant Jesus Christ or God
[30:26] talking about Jesus we know that same
[30:28] person he just imorph it over into a
[30:29] body of Flesh my righteous servant
[30:33] justify many listen he had to be
[30:36] righteous if he wasn't righteous you're
[30:39] not
[30:41] righteous If he if we can't believe he
[30:44] was the sinless one the righteous one
[30:48] the righteous judge now remember in the
[30:51] Book of Daniel this is where the people
[30:53] get all this old old man look to God cuz
[30:57] he's called the wigged one or the
[30:59] Ancient of Days listen if you're Eternal
[31:02] if you're the Ancient of Days it don't
[31:03] matter what age you are you're going to
[31:05] be 18 years old because you're not going
[31:07] to move one way or the other but for us
[31:09] to
[31:10] see that he's a righteous judge that he
[31:13] puts on that white wig to show that he's
[31:16] the
[31:17] judge he's the
[31:20] jury if you don't get on his side he's
[31:22] the
[31:23] Executioner but remember that Holy Ghost
[31:26] is your Advocate though right
[31:28] he's the one that comes right here for
[31:31] you and if he's righteous and the judge
[31:35] is righteous and the jury's
[31:40] righteous what's the Bible say if God be
[31:43] for us who can be against us come on we
[31:46] got to realize that if God's for us if
[31:48] we're in on the right in the right place
[31:50] at the right time God's got to do
[31:52] something for us but remember you can
[31:55] have the Holy Ghost and still grieve it
[31:57] right
[31:58] okay you you are the
[32:01] one you are the one
[32:04] that if you go out to door and say well
[32:06] we had a real dry service today well it
[32:09] ain't my
[32:12] fault praise the Lord
[32:15] anyway God bless you Sister we it's the
[32:17] way we talk here
[32:19] sorry we just
[32:21] plain so we got a righteous God a
[32:24] righteous judge we got a righteous
[32:26] Advocate we got somebody that does not
[32:28] make a mistake on our
[32:30] side and he ain't just on our side he's
[32:33] in us on the day of Pentecost he didn't
[32:35] just go with them people he'd been with
[32:37] them for three and a half years he went
[32:39] inside of them to where when their hand
[32:42] mve God hands move when their feet move
[32:45] God's feet
[32:46] move right everybody with me so he
[32:50] justified many for he shall bear their
[32:52] iniquities in other words like we were
[32:54] talking
[32:55] before you were born in sin shapen in
[32:59] iniquity a spouse from your mother's
[33:01] womb a liar that's several scriptures
[33:03] put together but you were doomed and on
[33:05] your way to
[33:06] hell that's right this
[33:09] guy okay because of what happened in the
[33:12] fall in the garden someone had to become
[33:16] what Adam couldn't
[33:19] be Adam couldn't be the just
[33:23] one Adam fell Adam had a flaw
[33:28] right
[33:30] hello but God said hang on a minute I'll
[33:33] put in my I can't see you like I used to
[33:36] see you Adam but I'm not going to I'm
[33:38] not going to leave you I'm going to come
[33:40] back in the woman have a put a seed in
[33:43] the woman I'm going to have a I'm going
[33:44] to have a body I'm going to have a body
[33:47] cast I'm going to be born with a naval
[33:49] just like you are see Adam didn't have
[33:51] one so Adam couldn't be our brother he
[33:53] couldn't be our
[33:54] Advocate that Adam does
[33:58] I was there when he was born that Adam
[34:00] has a has a belly button but the first
[34:02] Adam does
[34:03] not I'm pointing to Adam back there not
[34:08] back y
[34:10] under I'm just wondering we meet that
[34:12] Adam that was back under under if he's
[34:13] still not going to have
[34:17] one you'll be known as you are right
[34:20] just something think about but that
[34:22] one's got
[34:24] one Adam Roberts
[34:28] by his knowledge shall my righteous
[34:30] servant justify many for he shall bear
[34:32] their iniquities that's why he puts it
[34:34] in the sea of God's forgetfulness we've
[34:36] got to believe that that's where it goes
[34:40] that God did make a place that he can't
[34:42] remember everybody says God knows
[34:44] everything no he
[34:46] doesn't he decided that he didn't you
[34:49] know why he decided that he didn't
[34:50] because it couldn't be a righteous
[34:54] judge cuz all the people that are going
[34:56] to be judged it's why on judgment he
[34:58] didn't bear their iniquity they kept it
[35:02] don't keep your
[35:04] sin give it to God and you'll never have
[35:07] to worry about that again now later on
[35:09] you will but that one is
[35:11] gone my sin is gone it's in the sea of
[35:15] God's forgetfulness with a no fishing
[35:17] sign over
[35:21] there for he shall bear your iniquity
[35:25] and if he Bears my iniquity then I'm a
[35:27] sinless one oh come on somebody he's
[35:31] going to make us without spot or wrinkle
[35:32] is he well what's the spot iniquity
[35:35] watch's wrinkle an in iniquity he's
[35:38] going to take that away he's going to
[35:40] eradicate your past if you'll let him
[35:44] you got to let him though let go and let
[35:47] God do the work quit trying to figure
[35:49] this thing out for
[35:51] yourself right be still and know that I
[35:55] am God
[35:57] then God comes on it right down John 17
[36:00] now this is this is my Lord's Prayer to
[36:02] me we know what the Lord's Prayer is but
[36:04] this is The Lord's Prayer to me cuz he
[36:06] say sanctify them I'm one of them I'm
[36:08] one of them I'm one of them sanctify
[36:12] them through thy truth so how are you
[36:14] going to be Sanctified now we're going
[36:15] to get to it in just a few minutes where
[36:17] John the Baptist looks at him and he
[36:19] says look I'm going to baptize you with
[36:22] water but there's somebody coming that's
[36:24] not only going to baptize you with with
[36:26] water he not going to do that he's going
[36:28] to baptize you with Holy Ghost and Fire
[36:31] cuz listen the it's got to take the fire
[36:33] of God to burn the old nature of you out
[36:37] right cuz he won't dwell in an unclean
[36:39] vessel even in sanctification what
[36:41] drives that unclean Spirit out the word
[36:43] of God the heat that's put on right this
[36:46] is a hot seat talk about Israel being a
[36:49] hot seat now this is a hot seat right
[36:51] here this is life eternal or life
[36:56] damnation they fight all they want to
[36:58] over there this is the greatest battle
[36:59] ever fought right
[37:03] here but God is praying he said protect
[37:08] them through thy truth Thy word is truth
[37:13] clean them up Lord and keep them clean
[37:15] don't just clean them up keep them
[37:17] clean as thou has sent me into the world
[37:21] even so I have also sent them into the
[37:23] world now why here's the father he IMM
[37:26] morphes into the son we don't believe a
[37:27] trinity here there's there there the
[37:30] watch the first
[37:32] commandment behold oh Israel the Lord
[37:34] thy God is
[37:37] three that's how simple one God
[37:40] is behold oh Israel your God is
[37:44] one now he has many manifestations he
[37:47] has many am morphes he moves his form he
[37:50] moves over into the sun he moves he's
[37:51] into the Holy Ghost now just like me I'm
[37:54] a human being but I'm a father I'm a son
[37:59] hello I'm a human I work for the post
[38:02] office I have all many titles but I have
[38:04] one name that's why we baptize in the
[38:06] name of the Lord Jesus Christ not in
[38:08] titles of father son Holy Ghost I am a
[38:10] father but that's not my name I don't
[38:11] sign my check
[38:13] father amen I signed my check wait there
[38:16] because that what does that do that
[38:17] identifies me with the family that I'm
[38:19] in well praise God that's why Peter got
[38:21] up on the day of Pentecost and said
[38:22] repent every one of you and be baptized
[38:24] in the family name cuz you're in a
[38:27] another
[38:28] family until you get into this family
[38:32] and it's not a family of father son Holy
[38:34] Ghost it's a family of the Lord Jesus
[38:39] Christ as thou has sent me into the
[38:41] world even so have I sent you them into
[38:43] the world and for their sake the only
[38:47] reason Jesus didn't
[38:49] have a wife which you could have brother
[38:53] Brown said he could have and
[38:55] kids is because he said his itself aside
[38:58] for me and you because he became the
[39:00] Sanctified
[39:03] one we got to have a Justified one and
[39:06] if we're going to be Sanctified we got
[39:08] to have something Sanctified or the
[39:11] sanctifier to clean out and I like that
[39:15] sanctifier to clean us
[39:18] out for their sake I sanctify myself
[39:21] that they also might I can't do it no
[39:24] you
[39:25] can't but God can amen amen he come back
[39:29] on the day of Pentecost in the Holy form
[39:31] of the Holy Ghost to do exactly what he
[39:33] said he was going to do justify him he
[39:36] justified Peter for
[39:38] cussing come on somebody look at that he
[39:41] justified Peter from cutting off that
[39:44] guy's
[39:46] ear he Sanctified
[39:48] him and he breathed on him right
[39:51] here he breathed on him and said receive
[39:54] ye the Holy
[39:55] Ghost now remember they didn't receive
[39:58] it right there they received a
[40:00] promise cuz remember the Holy Ghost was
[40:02] standing there I'm standing here today
[40:04] I'm a father son and a spirit I can't
[40:07] imorph my spirit out of my body but
[40:10] praise God he
[40:11] can praise God he did and he divided
[40:14] himself 120 times 3,000 times and
[40:17] probably now 30 or 40 million times and
[40:20] he got no less weak he's just actually
[40:22] more
[40:25] strong he breathed on him and said
[40:27] receive ye the Holy Ghost whosoever sins
[40:30] you remit they are remitted whosoever
[40:32] sins you retain they are
[40:35] retained that's why we need to watch
[40:37] what we
[40:38] say by your words you'll be justified
[40:41] and by your words you'll be
[40:43] condemned now that word breathe on he
[40:46] breathed on
[40:48] them and it's a Hebrew it's an
[40:50] expression by the symbolic Act of
[40:52] breathing upon the apostles the
[40:54] communication of the power of the Holy
[40:55] Spirit to them this is the this is from
[40:57] the Greek lexican all right this word
[41:00] used only once by the translators in
[41:03] Genesis 2:7 so in Genesis 2:7 as the
[41:07] commentator says just as the original
[41:09] creation now remember Adam was an
[41:11] original creation
[41:13] Adam Eve wasn't a creation she'd come
[41:15] out of Adam cuz she was
[41:18] Adam everybody with me she was
[41:23] Adam that's hard to believe but me and
[41:26] but me and Jesus are not two different
[41:27] people if you look at it that way we are
[41:30] if I come out and I'm over here but Adam
[41:32] and Eve had the same
[41:35] DNA same Source
[41:38] amen but as he breathed on Adam and
[41:41] breathed into his nostrils the Breath of
[41:43] Life guess what he did then he breathed
[41:47] eternal life into them then he come over
[41:49] here on the day of Pentecost and what
[41:51] did he before the day of Pentecost he
[41:52] breathed on them those two words are the
[41:54] only two words used those two phrases
[41:57] say breathed on them breathe on him
[41:59] breathe on them that means that just as
[42:03] the original creation was completed by
[42:04] an act of God the new creation was
[42:07] completed by an act from the head of the
[42:08] new creation born by the Breath of God
[42:12] they literally had the Breath of God
[42:14] breathed on them and listen you say oh
[42:17] that was back then and that was for them
[42:19] when you received the baptism of the
[42:20] Holy Ghost you had the Breath of God
[42:22] breathed on you inside of you you were
[42:25] clean you were ready he was ready and he
[42:27] stood there and said I am pleased to
[42:30] dwell in that vessel right
[42:32] there and we scratch our
[42:35] head why me Lord well guess what maybe
[42:38] you hadn't found your full potential yet
[42:40] but you will if you're a son and
[42:42] daughter of God you're never a failure
[42:44] never will be a failure never have been
[42:45] a failure God has never unloved you he
[42:48] can't do that cuz he can't change his
[42:51] mind he can't change his mind if he
[42:53] loved you from the beginning he loved
[42:55] that Genesis 1: 126 creation that he had
[42:59] because it was
[43:01] him he loved it and canine love it we
[43:04] just got attach oursel to
[43:07] that say God that's me you know why cuz
[43:10] he saw you down here say God that's
[43:13] me I'm going to accept that I want that
[43:15] inside of
[43:17] me to have dominion over the fish of the
[43:19] Sea and the foul of the air and all the
[43:20] different
[43:21] things dear brother Bram what's the
[43:23] difference when Jesus breathed onto the
[43:25] disciples said receive ye the Holy Ghost
[43:28] when they had to go to the upper room to
[43:29] Terry it was a promise he give them
[43:31] breathed upon them his promise and said
[43:33] receive ye the Holy Ghost it was a
[43:35] promise they went to the upper room to
[43:37] wait for the promise to be fulfilled
[43:40] listen it's a promise when you start
[43:42] this Christian walk it's a promise that
[43:44] if you'll go through justification
[43:45] sanctification repent and be baptized
[43:49] amen am I reading Bible this is a
[43:51] prescription
[43:53] repent and be baptized in the name of
[43:55] Jesus Christ this is Peter
[43:57] right and you shall receive the gift of
[44:01] the Holy Ghost for the promise isn't to
[44:05] you and your children them to far off my
[44:07] children going to get the Holy
[44:09] Ghost it's a promise amen that's right
[44:13] but you have to wait till sometimes
[44:15] years to fulfill that promise amen don't
[44:19] give up on your
[44:22] kids God didn't give up on you did
[44:25] he he r you down and Found You amen so I
[44:30] pray he runs mine down and finds them
[44:33] sir they got to find their yourself they
[44:36] went to the upper room to wait for the
[44:37] promise to be fulfilled the same thing
[44:39] as when we lay hands upon to be healed
[44:41] then we go on about our business waiting
[44:43] for the promise to be fulfilled what
[44:46] promise that you'll receive your healing
[44:49] listen there's a miracle then there's
[44:52] Divine Healing Divine Healing may take a
[44:54] period of time we've seen Miracles where
[44:56] something happens right right then right
[44:58] something be taken away right there
[45:00] cancer come right off of a person right
[45:03] that was dying only had 3 months to live
[45:05] I've seen it with my own eyes cancer
[45:07] didn't fall off it just went out of his
[45:08] body right and you know what that was a
[45:12] demon if we'd been able to see in
[45:14] another dimension we'd have seen a demon
[45:15] take off listen brother Brown tells us
[45:18] many many times he said all sickness is
[45:20] of the devil there's a demon attached to
[45:23] every sickness that you
[45:25] got right that's why we send the Holy
[45:28] Spirit to attack that thing I don't send
[45:31] mine yours or nobody else's I send the
[45:33] holy spirit because he's holy he's right
[45:36] he's never wrong and you know what he'll
[45:38] do what his word
[45:41] says praise God what a mighty God we
[45:45] serve so in the upper
[45:47] room Matthew 3:1 so here's here's John
[45:52] the Baptist he's telling them he said I
[45:54] indeed baptize you with water into
[45:56] repentance but he that cometh after me
[45:58] is mightier than I now remember what was
[46:01] John John was the third coming of
[46:04] Elijah first Was Elijah second was
[46:07] Elisha third was John the Baptist fourth
[46:10] we believe was a prophet in the end time
[46:13] William brandham and the fifth one is
[46:15] going to the Jews one of the two
[46:17] witnesses that's why they're look listen
[46:19] folks the Jews are looking for Elijah to
[46:21] come
[46:22] back cuz he said he'll go he told him in
[46:25] Malachi he said I'll send him before I
[46:27] smite the Earth with a curse they just
[46:29] missed him oh they're going to see
[46:32] theirs but they missed this
[46:34] one I indeed baptize you with water into
[46:37] repentance but he that cometh after me
[46:39] is mightier than I whose shoes I am not
[46:42] worthy to Bear he shall baptize you with
[46:45] the Holy Ghost and with fire now that's
[46:47] a conjunction so that's two things that
[46:49] go on that's a conun and it's a
[46:52] conjunction sometimes we only dwell on
[46:54] the Holy Ghost you got to bring fire
[46:56] right
[46:57] listen to this the future
[47:00] home I love the future home man it tells
[47:03] you about everything tells you about
[47:04] your Redemption tells you about
[47:06] justification sanctification tells you
[47:07] what the Earth's going to do tell you
[47:09] what your body's going to do we're not
[47:10] getting a new
[47:12] body the Earth's not going to be blowned
[47:14] away in a new one created God's going to
[47:16] reform and reshape this one blow all the
[47:18] sin out of it just like one day did the
[47:20] same thing
[47:22] you I never shall forget the day the
[47:26] burdens of my what how did that happen
[47:30] am God did it you didn't that's right
[47:32] and I'll promise you thus sayith the
[47:35] lord the devil
[47:38] didn't bless his poor heart everything
[47:41] he touches and he tries to he tries to
[47:43] get think it today he tries to get an
[47:45] army together I was thinking about that
[47:46] boy that shot alling people he tries to
[47:48] get an army
[47:50] together and by the Free Will of that
[47:52] person sometimes they just take their
[47:53] life then another one steps up and he
[47:56] says well use this one and here they go
[47:58] and get shot or here they go and do this
[47:59] or commit suicide cuz remember you're a
[48:02] free moral
[48:03] agent you never forget that even with
[48:06] the Holy Ghost you're still a free moral
[48:08] agent that's right all right Satan can
[48:10] anoint you to do something but if
[48:13] you what is that
[48:17] scripture it's real
[48:19] complicated resist the
[48:22] devil and he'll flee from you
[48:27] that's right but see they don't resist
[48:29] him so they can't stand it why do you
[48:31] think people go
[48:33] crazy that's a
[48:35] demon that's you trying to I don't know
[48:38] where this is going this is you trying
[48:40] to be good you're a human you have an
[48:42] innate ability to be
[48:45] good amen cuz you were born in the image
[48:48] of God you just got messed up down
[48:50] through here somewhere but you have an
[48:52] innate ability to say
[48:55] no you can say no
[48:58] no but when you're but when he when he's
[49:01] trying to anoint you the devil's trying
[49:03] to anoint you and you don't want it
[49:05] it'll drive you
[49:06] crazy and then when he does get a hold
[49:08] of you it drives you worse crazy I tell
[49:10] you what I want the Holy Ghost to get a
[49:12] hold of all of us and make us all crazy
[49:15] where the world will look at us and say
[49:16] them some crazy
[49:18] people that's what they did on the day
[49:20] of Pentecost wasn't it them people's
[49:22] drunk they've been in the bar all night
[49:24] well praise God
[49:27] they got a spirit all right but it was a
[49:29] Holy One
[49:31] amen praise the Lord feeling
[49:35] good now watch brother R this is future
[49:39] home it isn't going to just going to
[49:41] have another Earth now what's he
[49:43] explaining this body is not going to be
[49:45] annihilated listen everybody's body is
[49:49] theirs right come
[49:51] on cuz if you don't get born again your
[49:55] body you're setting inight is going to
[49:57] the white Throne
[49:58] judgment amen you're not going you're
[50:01] going to go in the body you send in well
[50:03] what's the body you send in the one you
[50:04] sitting
[50:05] in amen but if we're born again where
[50:09] are we sitting now we're sitting in
[50:11] Heavenly places already
[50:14] judged don't have to go
[50:16] to we don't have to go to judgment we
[50:20] took his judge he took our judgment and
[50:22] we identified with him what a mighty God
[50:26] he you can only do that you and I can't
[50:28] do that that's why the devil just messes
[50:30] everything up I think he even hates
[50:32] himself sometime praise the Lord that's
[50:35] fine with me but now what brother Bown
[50:37] said look what he said he said I'm
[50:39] trying to get the Plan of Redemption to
[50:41] you now here he is talking about this
[50:43] place that we're going to live for an
[50:45] eternity the future home of the Heavenly
[50:48] bridegroom B bridegroom and Earthly
[50:51] bride so he's trying to explain to us
[50:54] how everything's going to come back down
[50:56] here
[50:58] and and you know we may be crazy sister
[51:00] but but I don't think we're going to go
[51:02] sit on sit on clouds and play Hearts I
[51:05] can't play spoons so I'd be in real
[51:08] trouble and I really don't want to sit
[51:09] on the cloud for an
[51:12] eternity John saw the
[51:15] city John saw the city coming
[51:19] down here's where Heaven's going to
[51:21] reside right here my home is on this
[51:24] Earth cuz I came out of this Earth
[51:27] God created this Earth to be inhabited
[51:29] he created it to be lived on but he
[51:31] didn't create it for all this garbage to
[51:32] be lived on he created it for his
[51:34] children to live
[51:37] on he's the only one that can do that he
[51:40] made this great big
[51:42] ball and we think we
[51:44] can we think we can trick
[51:47] him I'm trying to get the Plan of
[51:49] Redemption to you before if I don't get
[51:52] nothing else so he's he's he's he tried
[51:54] to tell him about a future home he tried
[51:56] to tell him that that home's coming down
[51:57] from heaven that it's made of pure gold
[51:59] that it's going to be sitting on the
[52:01] mountain that it's going to be right
[52:02] here on the Earth but he's trying to get
[52:03] the Plan of Redemption because remember
[52:05] the way he redeems the Earth is the same
[52:08] way he redeems
[52:09] you because remember he will not step
[52:12] his holy feet on this Earth until all
[52:14] that's
[52:17] done but now he's stepping it today in
[52:20] me and you
[52:22] amen cuz he said that
[52:26] he said he was going to come back and go
[52:28] in us right if he comes in us that's
[52:33] God what's the great mystery the great
[52:35] mystery of this world is Paul said was
[52:37] Christ in you the hope of
[52:40] glory us getting older more feeble can't
[52:43] see can't
[52:44] hear somebody sent me a text message the
[52:47] other day and I wrote I sent them back I
[52:48] said I can't hear what you're
[52:50] saying somebody get that in a minute the
[52:53] B if you don't get nothing else
[52:57] the baptism of fire now here we go with
[52:59] the Holy Ghost and Fire this is where uh
[53:01] this will bring the picture
[53:02] together cuz listen you can receive the
[53:05] Holy Ghost on your spirit realm right
[53:09] and be lost you can be an anointed one
[53:12] the anointing can come down on you you
[53:14] could prophesy do as balum do as Kus do
[53:17] as different ones that did and be lost
[53:22] amen so you got to have the Holy Ghost
[53:24] and Fire
[53:26] amen right what what was on top of them
[53:29] people in the upper
[53:30] room LS of
[53:33] fire listen that fire will burn you I
[53:37] got burnt today my two fingers are still
[53:39] stinging I got stick my finger where you
[53:41] ain't supposed to and you get
[53:44] burnt no it's on
[53:46] me but God will burn you with a fire
[53:49] that'll burn everything out and never
[53:50] leave a
[53:53] scar what a great physician we got
[53:57] what a God that will take all that sin
[53:59] out put it in the sea of forgetfulness
[54:01] whatever ugliness it is gone and he
[54:05] didn't even leave a
[54:06] scar the only scar you got is what you
[54:09] got in your brain the greatest battle
[54:11] ever fought right here cuz God don't
[54:13] have this
[54:14] totally God's got your heart God chose
[54:17] the heart Satan chose this that's right
[54:20] CU you know what God is simple believe
[54:21] me or don't believe me two things in the
[54:23] heart right not heart thumping heart but
[54:25] your your soul all right but in your but
[54:28] in your mind you have memory reason
[54:29] conscious effects and Imagination things
[54:31] you live with all right that's where
[54:33] Satan can play but if he he can't play
[54:35] in your soul if if if God's got it God
[54:38] won't dwell in an unclean vessel and you
[54:39] can't listen Satan hates the fire of God
[54:42] he can't stand it cuz that's why he
[54:45] leaves all that we have the fire god
[54:49] just a little bit more in this church
[54:51] that don't mean shouting speaking in
[54:52] tongues that just means having a fervor
[54:55] to do more for God amen instead of just
[54:58] come to church getting gold stars that
[55:00] you came two weeks in a row some of you
[55:02] can't but two weeks in a row the baptism
[55:04] of fire on it only is to cleanse it now
[55:08] watch and make it a fit place for his
[55:11] Meek to live
[55:13] in one more time the baptism of fire on
[55:17] it only is to cleanse it and make it fit
[55:20] a fit place for his meat to live in cuz
[55:23] you go back to the scripture where that
[55:25] this is going to be burned off
[55:27] yes now the many people think this is
[55:30] going to be
[55:32] annihilated it's not going to be
[55:33] annihilated God created it for us to
[55:35] live on he can't change his mind
[55:39] remember but he's going to clean it off
[55:42] so that his holy people can walk on
[55:45] it like he did us his creation to live
[55:51] in before he could come in it all right
[55:55] where is he he's not
[55:58] there he's not the two two two a a holy
[56:02] thing and a and unclean thing can't come
[56:03] out of the Same
[56:06] Soul either one or the other that's
[56:09] right amen so he comes in and burns that
[56:11] old nature out he doesn't kill you he
[56:13] kills the you that you don't need to be
[56:16] but you don't die and the and the you
[56:18] know the thing flat lines then all of a
[56:20] sudden you raise back up no he kills
[56:24] that nature that's attached to you
[56:26] righten that motivated you to do what
[56:29] you're doing or have
[56:33] done before he could come in it he had
[56:36] to give us the baptism of fire now watch
[56:39] then the Holy Ghost come in and
[56:43] live baptism of fire then when we get
[56:46] that baptism of fire then the Holy Ghost
[56:49] can come in what as it does it burns up
[56:53] everything contrary to the word out of
[56:58] you it won't believe nothing else but
[57:01] the word because it is the word now
[57:04] that's what we were talking about the
[57:05] other night the evidence of the Holy
[57:06] Ghost the evidence of the Holy Ghost is
[57:09] when you can receive the word now watch
[57:11] receive the word not some
[57:14] system but have a
[57:17] clear
[57:19] understanding I have a clear
[57:21] understanding why I'm in this message I
[57:23] hope you
[57:24] do I have a clear understanding why I
[57:27] can't go feed on that out there in the
[57:29] world I have a clear understanding why
[57:31] this is it and there's nothing
[57:35] else you know why because the one that
[57:37] wrote the bibles inside of
[57:39] us how do you know the word is
[57:42] clear understand it watch it vindicate
[57:48] itself well you say I see this do it and
[57:51] that oh yes weeds live the same way
[57:56] cuz remember he talking about you know
[57:57] some Min Minister told me one time said
[57:59] now all the seeds there ever was was in
[58:02] the earth I told him I said I agree cuz
[58:04] he's talking about the seed being
[58:06] here I said but the bad ones were there
[58:12] too right where'd all the bad seed come
[58:15] from I know we know it came from the
[58:16] fall but where'd it come from it was
[58:18] there we must be
[58:21] careful but it's got to be the entire
[58:24] word listen to to be the bride you have
[58:28] to be part of him he is the word what
[58:31] part of him is it the word that's promis
[58:34] for this day when he calls his bride not
[58:37] in Luther's day not in Wesley's day not
[58:39] in Pentecost that we've been talking
[58:40] about this day right here right listen
[58:43] this day this scripture is being
[58:45] fulfilled this day the Bible is being
[58:47] fulfilled this day prophecy is being
[58:51] fulfilled today don't look for another
[58:54] day today it's been fulfilled you walk
[58:56] in that door and receive the word of God
[58:58] and it becomes more
[59:00] Godlike you have received the promised
[59:02] word for your day you know why because
[59:05] you
[59:07] Vindicated I didn't say hate it I said
[59:10] you Vindicated
[59:14] amen and what is a part of him the word
[59:16] that's promised for this day when he
[59:18] calls his bride be a part of it Ministry
[59:22] of Christ
[59:24] 1953 you know what I done I built a
[59:26] little fire and set the old boy on it he
[59:29] moved then what we need today is not
[59:31] Church joining or arguing about baptism
[59:34] just the Holy Ghost in fire that'll make
[59:36] any church move get the Holy Spirit back
[59:39] in the church and the apostles and
[59:41] teachers and so forth I wish some people
[59:43] read that the apostles and teachers and
[59:46] so forth ENT their
[59:48] places and let the Holy Ghost go to
[59:51] reigning on a church like that and see
[59:53] what takes place signs and wonders and
[59:55] miracles mirales will follow sure it
[59:58] will questions and answers
[1:00:02] 1963 we'll get started here now brother
[1:00:05] B tells us that each AE had the dip of
[1:00:07] the Holy Ghost justification is a work
[1:00:10] sanctification is a work but the baptism
[1:00:12] is the holy
[1:00:14] spirit that's the reason it took a
[1:00:16] prophetic Prophet talking about himself
[1:00:18] to come down no Messenger to the age all
[1:00:21] right there's no mess of the age of
[1:00:22] Pentecost cuz the gifts came to be what
[1:00:24] to be brought back to life
[1:00:26] in the day isusa Street
[1:00:28] Pentecost because the Holy Ghost came
[1:00:30] himself in the fullness of the baptism
[1:00:32] but at the end of the age in other words
[1:00:33] at the end of the Pentecostal age
[1:00:35] brother Ram steps on the scene 1947 all
[1:00:39] right now he preached a lot time before
[1:00:40] that because remember 33 down to River
[1:00:42] he was
[1:00:43] preaching all right but his commission
[1:00:45] came in 1947 all right actually the year
[1:00:49] that Israel was made a nation but at the
[1:00:52] end of the age as it always ends up in
[1:00:53] the other we find there then The
[1:00:55] Messengers sent so there was no
[1:00:57] messenger the Pentecost Pentecost went
[1:00:59] from 1906 to about 1915 it says in the
[1:01:02] records and then it kind of dwindled a
[1:01:04] little bit more to the 20s and 30s and
[1:01:07] then it just
[1:01:08] splintered into every denomination there
[1:01:11] was out of that one Pentecostal movement
[1:01:14] that's why brother Bram come to rebuke
[1:01:16] the
[1:01:17] Pentecostals did he not rebuke the
[1:01:19] Pentecostals he rebuked them every
[1:01:21] chance he could why because they had
[1:01:23] something
[1:01:26] God had moved from the lutherans to the
[1:01:28] Westland from the Westlands to Pentecost
[1:01:30] being a prophet he saw that the
[1:01:32] anointing was not on them anymore it was
[1:01:34] on the Pentecostal but remember the Holy
[1:01:37] Ghost is timid the Holy Ghost does not
[1:01:39] like I'll read it in a
[1:01:43] minute that's why the Holy Ghost left
[1:01:45] them because the Holy Ghost brother R
[1:01:46] said loves
[1:01:48] order when you get out of order the Holy
[1:01:50] Spirit leaves I'll read it to you right
[1:01:52] here cuz every prayer line you hear what
[1:01:55] do he telling to do be still quiet and
[1:01:59] down Welly that's different than what we
[1:02:01] get now when we go to special meeting
[1:02:03] quiet and down now don't move around
[1:02:05] you're all
[1:02:07] Spirits right and the holy spirit's very
[1:02:09] timid I'm going to read it to you the
[1:02:10] holy spirit's very timid you do one
[1:02:12] thing wrong and he'll leave the building
[1:02:15] brother R said one time he did and he
[1:02:17] left and he said I was left standing
[1:02:20] there
[1:02:23] wow so in 8030 the Holy Ghost fell on
[1:02:25] 120 mature word tutored bride people all
[1:02:29] right that's the apostles and all the
[1:02:30] different ones cuz they listen they had
[1:02:32] to get it right to start with God had to
[1:02:35] make sure his word was right with no
[1:02:36] denominational idea to begin with cuz he
[1:02:39] knew it was going to fall he knew the
[1:02:41] seed was going to go on the ground he
[1:02:42] knew that there'd be a pommer worm
[1:02:44] kangar worm caterpillar and Locust
[1:02:46] according to Joel that was going to eat
[1:02:47] his word down not kill it eat it
[1:02:51] down cuz I'm going to read you quote
[1:02:53] here in a few minutes the Holy Spirit
[1:02:54] can only work with what word you give
[1:02:58] him that's why Martin Luther could only
[1:03:00] work and the Holy Ghost could only work
[1:03:02] just shall live by
[1:03:04] faith all right but now remember Peter
[1:03:08] steps out and he preaches a sermon
[1:03:10] probably 30 minutes or more or less I
[1:03:12] know that's what y'all want now
[1:03:14] but but 3,000 babies you
[1:03:18] babies listen to One powerful sermon
[1:03:21] right and they received the Holy Ghost
[1:03:23] as babies they didn't know what was
[1:03:24] going on they said men and brother what
[1:03:26] we do we ain't been tutored then
[1:03:29] remember a little bit further down in
[1:03:30] the book of Acts they go and meet a
[1:03:32] group of people I think it was House of
[1:03:33] Cornelius he was preaching that Jesus
[1:03:35] was the Christ you think the it had to
[1:03:39] come life had to come through the
[1:03:41] body it had they Peter had to come one
[1:03:44] time Paul had to come one time Paul says
[1:03:46] if you receive the Holy Ghost since you
[1:03:49] believe so we don't know if there it be
[1:03:51] one they must have not been near them
[1:03:54] 120 or those 3,00
[1:03:56] am cuz they didn't know what was going
[1:03:58] on but listen they felt the pull of the
[1:04:01] day they do you not feel the pull of the
[1:04:03] day I feel the pull of the day yes sir
[1:04:07] be convinced as brother R said and then
[1:04:09] be concerned about what's going on right
[1:04:12] but now when it come to isusa Street
[1:04:14] they had already went through that that
[1:04:16] dying off stage right pmer worm head e
[1:04:20] canker Locust
[1:04:22] caterpillar come up with Martin Luther
[1:04:24] two shoots John Wesley a stalk Pentecost
[1:04:28] was the Shu kind of looked like the seed
[1:04:30] but it wasn't a seed because God's
[1:04:31] looking for that Original Seed that went
[1:04:33] in the ground he's not looking for the
[1:04:35] plant he's looking for the seed cuz
[1:04:38] that's what you plant again oh praise
[1:04:40] the Lord I hope y'all get
[1:04:42] that convinced and concerned but that
[1:04:46] predestinated seed don't ask no
[1:04:47] questions it's thoroughly convinced that
[1:04:50] it's God moving according to his promise
[1:04:52] in the Bible listen
[1:04:56] a little further up the road
[1:04:58] really than isua Street we should be
[1:05:01] what's he doing now he's rebuking
[1:05:04] them you're still back there speaking in
[1:05:06] tongues and you're still what having a
[1:05:08] fit and the Holy Ghost don't like it
[1:05:11] right the church should be up here here
[1:05:15] it started with a weeping crying coming
[1:05:16] to God and it's fell way away wait a
[1:05:21] minute this is
[1:05:24] 1962 that's 62 years
[1:05:28] ago he said it's fell away right if my
[1:05:31] math is correct close enough
[1:05:35] anyway but
[1:05:37] yet and it's fell away way away and
[1:05:40] here's something up here that the church
[1:05:43] should be up to meet it now he's talking
[1:05:44] about his message brother Brandon
[1:05:47] preached sure he preached 47 through
[1:05:50] there but when he started his message
[1:05:52] that was to a mature group that wasn't
[1:05:54] even there right think about it right
[1:05:58] there was no message churches made from
[1:06:00] Brother Brown's preaching until way
[1:06:03] after he
[1:06:03] died everybody went scattering again
[1:06:06] went back to different places Shepherd
[1:06:08] had gone Shepherd had been smitten sheep
[1:06:10] scattered
[1:06:12] right but look here they should be up to
[1:06:15] meet it but yet they're not convinced
[1:06:17] yet that's the reason it's not
[1:06:21] concerned amen so Malachi 45 says behold
[1:06:26] I'll send
[1:06:28] you behold I'll send
[1:06:30] you you you you you you you Elijah the
[1:06:37] prophet he didn't send it to a group of
[1:06:39] people he sent it to one person me you
[1:06:43] deal with it
[1:06:46] yourself behold I will send you Elijah
[1:06:49] the prophet I'll quote it before the
[1:06:51] great and de day of the Lord he's going
[1:06:52] to send this Elijah to do two things
[1:06:56] so he's going to send the spirit of
[1:06:57] Elijah and John the Baptist to do what
[1:07:01] to take him from the Old Testament to
[1:07:05] the New
[1:07:06] Testament amen this new thing
[1:07:11] babies then it's going to mature it's
[1:07:13] going to mature go in the ground the
[1:07:15] bugs remember the four bugs come back
[1:07:18] atza street but it came back on
[1:07:20] untrained babies because they were still
[1:07:22] looking at the doctrines from Luther
[1:07:25] Columbus all the way back cuz they they
[1:07:27] they they brought false Doctrine with
[1:07:30] them let's just say it that way they
[1:07:32] brought false Doctrine with
[1:07:34] him and God can't move in false
[1:07:37] Doctrine that's right he'll move but he
[1:07:40] won't move free in false
[1:07:43] Doctrine God's will is going to be done
[1:07:46] I promise you that but it is hindered if
[1:07:48] the holy spirit's hindered because of a
[1:07:50] kid running through the
[1:07:53] church right
[1:07:57] are bringing a bad spirit
[1:08:02] in but the second part is for me and
[1:08:06] you he's going to turn the heart he's
[1:08:08] going to turn our
[1:08:10] soul come
[1:08:12] on brother Brown didn't come to bring
[1:08:14] you the new
[1:08:16] birth that's right Jesus Christ gives
[1:08:19] you the new birth there's no mortal man
[1:08:22] on the face of this Earth can give you
[1:08:23] the new birth except one man and that's
[1:08:25] the Lord Jesus Christ amen through the
[1:08:28] Holy Ghost and morph Fe into the Holy
[1:08:29] Ghost so he can go out into more people
[1:08:31] than just
[1:08:32] one to me that's simply why the Holy
[1:08:35] Ghost was given so he could move as a
[1:08:38] spirit among his people amen and not
[1:08:41] just be Jesus walking down the aisle
[1:08:43] because if Jesus is all everything which
[1:08:44] he is if he's here on the earth ain't
[1:08:47] none of us in we're not included in that
[1:08:50] listen when he was here on Earth who
[1:08:52] understood that man
[1:08:55] not one person am all his disciples left
[1:09:00] him Peter lied three times cussed at him
[1:09:05] wow he picked a real good group of
[1:09:08] people well bless God he picked a real
[1:09:10] good people here
[1:09:12] too from All Nations
[1:09:15] tongues
[1:09:18] backgrounds brought us right
[1:09:20] here so he's going to turn the heart of
[1:09:22] the children and how's he going to turn
[1:09:23] it by the word amen all right by the
[1:09:26] pure word of God coming back in the end
[1:09:29] time he's going to send us Elijah the
[1:09:32] prophet before the great and Dreadful
[1:09:34] day of the
[1:09:35] Lord or lest I come and smite the Earth
[1:09:38] with a curse so brother randam steps on
[1:09:40] the saying what are they they're
[1:09:41] Pentecostal babies he's trying to bring
[1:09:44] them to
[1:09:45] maturity all right he succeeds in a
[1:09:48] degree but remember he he didn't say
[1:09:50] Rapture and faith lies in the
[1:09:54] churches right right
[1:09:59] right he said rapturing faith lies in
[1:10:03] these books and
[1:10:05] tapes these 1100 sermons that we listen
[1:10:08] to and that we Revere and that we listen
[1:10:10] to the voice of God telling us a clear
[1:10:13] way to
[1:10:15] believe I just praise God that I was
[1:10:18] able to even
[1:10:21] hear a little bit of what he was
[1:10:23] saying so what did brother R he has a
[1:10:26] vision in 1956 now this is
[1:10:30] 1956 he has a vision the angel says you
[1:10:33] can't teach Pentecostal babies
[1:10:34] Supernatural things you'll cause carnal
[1:10:37] impersonations which it did oil in the
[1:10:39] hand they had blood running out it was
[1:10:41] just all uh musician tricks is all it
[1:10:44] was now that's true now 1964 let's jump
[1:10:49] up just a few years
[1:10:51] later he's talking about the same thing
[1:10:54] he promised about the pull of that line
[1:10:56] remember he was fishing got all tangled
[1:10:58] up he said you can't teach Pentecostal
[1:11:01] baby Supernatural things and when I made
[1:11:03] that third pull he said now don't tell
[1:11:05] nobody about this you've been trying to
[1:11:07] explain that other why was he trying to
[1:11:10] listen he explained it to
[1:11:15] us cuz we're the ones we're the ones to
[1:11:18] get it everybody with me he was trying
[1:11:21] to explain it to babies mature stuff
[1:11:26] am they couldn't take
[1:11:29] it that's why when they said brother
[1:11:31] brandham was on his discernment he was
[1:11:33] of God but when he preached he was of
[1:11:35] the devil now that's what they said
[1:11:39] right that's a baby that's almost
[1:11:45] Blasphemous when I made that third pull
[1:11:47] he said now don't tell nobody about this
[1:11:49] you've been trying to explain that other
[1:11:51] don't tell nobody about this this is the
[1:11:53] great and final pull if you'll look from
[1:11:55] 47 to 63 you can see brother random
[1:11:58] trying to pull them Pentecostals out
[1:12:00] amen rebuking them and trying to get
[1:12:02] them to come just step up a little high
[1:12:04] I just read you the quote step up a
[1:12:06] little higher come on up here where I'm
[1:12:09] at in other words all right come into
[1:12:11] the perfect word as the song says right
[1:12:15] but they didn't they stayed where they
[1:12:16] was at so what is this all for it's all
[1:12:20] for me and you right the third pull is
[1:12:24] what it was not it was in his it was in
[1:12:27] its partiality when brother Ram was
[1:12:29] here but not in his fullness until right
[1:12:32] now cuz what is the third
[1:12:34] pull is to the totally lost
[1:12:37] people right to the bride church and
[1:12:40] totally lost we will be preaching to the
[1:12:44] totally lost people
[1:12:47] amen they still going to think they
[1:12:49] getting saved still what they think they
[1:12:51] getting the Holy
[1:12:54] Ghost read it to you in just a
[1:12:56] minute now let's look at this real quick
[1:12:59] 1 Corinthians
[1:13:00] 12 we're talking about now what what was
[1:13:03] restored on the day of
[1:13:04] Pentecost 1906 just several years ago
[1:13:08] you know hund and something years ago
[1:13:10] right what was restored the
[1:13:13] gifts all right the Holy Ghost come
[1:13:16] bringing the gifts to the people now
[1:13:17] what did it start doing it started
[1:13:19] cleaning the church
[1:13:20] up now we know man got involved and
[1:13:23] turned it right about about the other
[1:13:24] way about face we always do man gets
[1:13:26] involved we go the other way 1
[1:13:28] Corinthians 12 wherefore now this is
[1:13:31] Paul wherefore I give you to understand
[1:13:33] that no man speaking by the spirit of
[1:13:35] God and that's a capital S so we know
[1:13:37] that's the Holy Spirit everybody with
[1:13:40] me so by the speaking by the spirit of
[1:13:43] God calleth Jesus the
[1:13:45] cursed that no man can say that Jesus is
[1:13:48] the Lord but by the Holy Ghost that's
[1:13:52] why they I mean they take his name in
[1:13:54] vain now more than anything they don't
[1:13:56] call on Jesus Christ like we do they say
[1:13:58] his name in
[1:14:03] vain horrible thing now there are
[1:14:06] diversities of gifts now he's he's
[1:14:08] talking to the Corinthians all right now
[1:14:09] there are diversities of gifts but the
[1:14:12] Same Spirit now remember watch watch
[1:14:15] this just a minute though but look over
[1:14:17] at the
[1:14:19] Devil the devil is one Spirit but he has
[1:14:23] many demons working with him right
[1:14:26] anybody with me all right so there's
[1:14:29] diversities of gifts under God but one
[1:14:32] Spirit
[1:14:33] overall right and there are differences
[1:14:36] of administration Apostles prophets or
[1:14:39] deacons Elders you know there are
[1:14:42] differences of administrations but the
[1:14:44] same lord and there are diversities of
[1:14:47] operations right we're a diverse group
[1:14:51] but it is the same God which worketh all
[1:14:54] in all but the manifestation of the
[1:14:56] spirit is given to every man to profit
[1:14:58] all right now look the manifestation of
[1:15:00] the spirit of God the holy spirit is
[1:15:03] given to every man to profit with all
[1:15:05] now
[1:15:05] watch for to one is given now look I'm
[1:15:09] goingon to read a quote here in a few
[1:15:09] minutes brother M said he can use one
[1:15:11] man to get up speaking tongues one time
[1:15:13] and one woman to um interpret and never
[1:15:17] use them
[1:15:19] again that's called a
[1:15:22] gift all right but now the as brother
[1:15:25] Dale always told us you know the the
[1:15:27] five-fold ministry is a is a
[1:15:29] predestinated gift it's a gift of God he
[1:15:31] gives you brother R will tell us he said
[1:15:33] these prophets he said but some are born
[1:15:36] prophets all right I'll read it here in
[1:15:38] just a second for to one is given by the
[1:15:41] spirit the word of wisdom now we're
[1:15:43] looking at non spiritual gifts and we
[1:15:46] say well we don't have any gifts working
[1:15:47] in our church because nobody stands up
[1:15:49] and speaks in tongues and nobody
[1:15:52] prophesies well that's what we're going
[1:15:54] to get to it wait down the road there's
[1:15:56] seven other real good spirits before we
[1:15:59] get to the speaking in tongues all right
[1:16:01] part of one is given by the spirit the
[1:16:03] word of wisdom now here's the definition
[1:16:06] according to the Greek lexican skill in
[1:16:09] the management of Affairs skill and
[1:16:12] discretion in imparting Christian truth
[1:16:16] Supreme intelligence such as belongs to
[1:16:20] God Amen we have the wisdom of God
[1:16:26] amen skill in the management of
[1:16:30] Affairs skill and discretion and
[1:16:33] imparting Christian
[1:16:35] truth I believe we have a wonderful
[1:16:38] ministry here we had one in my dad that
[1:16:41] imparted the words of
[1:16:43] wisdom because what they do that he use
[1:16:47] skill skill in what management of
[1:16:50] Affairs or skill and discretion in
[1:16:52] imparting Christian truth what the word
[1:16:54] of God
[1:16:55] Amen to another the word of knowledge by
[1:16:58] The Same Spirit now watch he keeps
[1:17:00] telling them look there's not a
[1:17:01] different Spirit working here one Spirit
[1:17:04] working one Spirit working there's only
[1:17:06] one Spirit many gifts one Spirit to
[1:17:09] another word of knowledge by The Same
[1:17:11] Spirit knowledge signifies in general
[1:17:14] intelligence or understanding the
[1:17:17] general knowledge of Christian religion
[1:17:19] that's why listen folks we study you
[1:17:22] will not get knowledge right
[1:17:25] that's right like brother Ryan said
[1:17:27] without opening your Bible how you going
[1:17:28] to read it amen without listening to the
[1:17:32] tap now listen I'm telling you I don't
[1:17:33] listen to tapes I read books I can't
[1:17:35] listen to tape I fall asleep my mind
[1:17:38] wanders but when I read a book I'm
[1:17:40] focused on it amen but
[1:17:43] look I'm not looking for knowledge for
[1:17:46] me oh yeah sure I
[1:17:48] am but I'm imparting it to you
[1:17:51] guys same way with you when that was
[1:17:54] something happened other day and I'm not
[1:17:56] going to go into the
[1:17:57] details but I was going to do something
[1:17:59] and I told Brother Bob about it and he
[1:18:01] said I wouldn't do
[1:18:03] that gift of wisdom
[1:18:06] brother gift of wisdom yeah you don't
[1:18:08] even know amen and it absolutely turned
[1:18:11] out perfect that's God that's God using
[1:18:16] a gift that I the pastor is going to do
[1:18:20] this Bob said I wouldn't do that so I
[1:18:24] didn't and worked out fine prise the
[1:18:26] Lord that's what I'm telling you we
[1:18:28] we're we're a body here right I ain't
[1:18:31] got all the answ I'm like Paul I'm the
[1:18:33] chief of the
[1:18:36] siners I need
[1:18:38] help right
[1:18:41] okay we all do but God put me here to
[1:18:44] guide you what does he do he didn't
[1:18:46] bring me here to make you a
[1:18:48] sheep I hope you're already sheep
[1:18:52] Shepherd don't don't lead cows
[1:18:56] I didn't say that to make any light of
[1:18:59] anything
[1:19:01] but okay I'll continue
[1:19:04] on he sent a Shepherd to lead sheep to
[1:19:07] lead them amen right right in the pass
[1:19:09] of righteousness and all that we know
[1:19:10] that all right there's got to be
[1:19:12] somebody but remember as I told him at
[1:19:15] meeting the other day I said look I got
[1:19:16] to give an account for you you don't
[1:19:17] have to give an account for
[1:19:19] me right
[1:19:22] hello right you know what brother R said
[1:19:24] about the
[1:19:25] bride about your bride he said you won't
[1:19:28] have to give an account I mean you'll
[1:19:29] have to give an account for your wife
[1:19:30] but your wife won't have to give an
[1:19:31] account for you well you're the Bride of
[1:19:32] Jesus Christ aren't you right amen and
[1:19:34] I'm the spiritual husband at the moment
[1:19:36] at the time under Christ
[1:19:38] headship that's why brother Dell always
[1:19:40] said he said I'll have to give an
[1:19:42] account CU there's no gifts working he
[1:19:43] didn't say no gifts he he's talking
[1:19:44] about the the Lesser gifts all the other
[1:19:47] gifts are working cu the we was working
[1:19:48] the other day right but listen we got to
[1:19:51] be able to yield to it though and not
[1:19:52] get all puffed up and mad about it right
[1:19:55] am I could
[1:19:58] have but it absolutely worked out the
[1:20:00] way it was supposed to thank you brother
[1:20:02] Bob appreciate that I'm giving you a
[1:20:05] rose in front of everybody because you
[1:20:07] really probably didn't even know what
[1:20:08] you did you don't but I'll tell you
[1:20:10] later and you'll
[1:20:12] go
[1:20:14] okay but now watch the deeper and more
[1:20:18] perfect and enlarged knowledge of this
[1:20:23] religion such as belongs to the more
[1:20:26] advanced a
[1:20:28] mature especially of things lawful and
[1:20:31] unlawful for Christians we have to be
[1:20:33] kept in line cuz remember sheep will
[1:20:38] scatter moral wisdom such as is seen in
[1:20:42] right
[1:20:43] living to another Faith now this is the
[1:20:46] this is the gifts to another Faith by
[1:20:49] The Same Spirit conviction of the truth
[1:20:52] of anything you got to believe it to
[1:20:53] have faith in it right there's a
[1:20:55] conviction there that you got to say I
[1:20:57] believe
[1:20:58] that Mary said be it unto me according
[1:21:01] to Thy word there's nobody since a dawn
[1:21:02] a time had a baby without a
[1:21:05] man hello just be simple plain and she
[1:21:09] said I'll do
[1:21:11] it well it had to be something down
[1:21:13] inside to tell her I'll do it be it unto
[1:21:17] me according to Thy word had you right
[1:21:19] that ain't nothing but the truth she had
[1:21:22] Faith or conviction that brother Brown
[1:21:24] what he said was true amen all right to
[1:21:28] another so when I started looking at all
[1:21:31] this Susan I I started looking at this I
[1:21:33] got to feeling better because we do have
[1:21:35] gifts working in this church we have
[1:21:38] gifts working in this church all the
[1:21:40] time the gifts of healing by The Same
[1:21:43] Spirit now what does that mean make
[1:21:45] whole to cure or heal you can do it
[1:21:47] natural or spiritual amen right to
[1:21:51] another the working of Miracles now this
[1:21:54] word this this is what got me when you
[1:21:56] look that word up miracles in the Greek
[1:21:59] it's the same word as you shall receive
[1:22:03] power after the Holy Ghost has come
[1:22:06] dunamus that word Miracles means dunamus
[1:22:09] which is strength or power inherent
[1:22:12] power power residing In A Thing by what
[1:22:15] by virtue of its nature listen if you
[1:22:17] had had a nature
[1:22:18] change you still got the old nature amen
[1:22:22] so strength and power miracle
[1:22:26] listen sometimes folks sometimes that's
[1:22:28] a miracle you get to
[1:22:30] church you just may not know that that's
[1:22:35] right to another
[1:22:38] prophecy a
[1:22:40] discourse emanating from divine
[1:22:43] inspiration in other words a prophecy
[1:22:45] can go forth but remember I didn't write
[1:22:49] it in here but brother B says a prophecy
[1:22:52] has to be put up by for two or three
[1:22:57] people there are certain of these gifts
[1:22:59] that if you speak up and say thus sayth
[1:23:01] the Lord Brother John your car is going
[1:23:03] to tear up don't go that direction if
[1:23:04] you go the other way you'll get home it
[1:23:07] has to be judged whether that's right or
[1:23:08] not and if it's wrong brother B said
[1:23:11] it's an evil spirit and you got to get
[1:23:12] it out of the
[1:23:14] church that's how good God is
[1:23:18] though a discourse emanating from divine
[1:23:20] inspiration and declaring the purpose
[1:23:24] purpose of God whether by reproving and
[1:23:26] admonishing the wicked or comforting The
[1:23:29] Afflicted or revealing things hidden
[1:23:32] especially by foretelling future events
[1:23:36] we've had that brother R's part of it
[1:23:37] we've had it in his church too to
[1:23:40] another Discerning of Pi now what's
[1:23:41] Discerning now look that s is
[1:23:45] little everybody with me look that s is
[1:23:49] not big it's not capital S so that's
[1:23:52] Discerning of spirits
[1:23:57] or judging whether spirit's right or
[1:24:00] wrong to another divers means many are
[1:24:05] diverse that's where you get the word
[1:24:07] diverse from to another diverse kinds of
[1:24:11] tongues now this what in the Greek of
[1:24:13] that word right there the origin of the
[1:24:16] expression is apparently to be found in
[1:24:20] the fact that in Hebrew the tongue is
[1:24:22] spoken of as a leading instrument by
[1:24:25] which the Praises of God are
[1:24:28] proclaimed and that's true you can't
[1:24:30] without a tongue you can't
[1:24:32] sing hello without tongue you can't talk
[1:24:37] right but you got to remember James
[1:24:39] talked about that little thing in your
[1:24:40] mouth too be careful with it it's
[1:24:43] destroyed Nations right the tongue is
[1:24:47] spoken of as the leading instrument by
[1:24:49] which the Praises of God are proclaimed
[1:24:51] and that according to the more rigorous
[1:24:53] conception of inspiration in other words
[1:24:55] something behind it everybody with me
[1:24:58] nothing
[1:24:59] human in an inspired man was thought to
[1:25:02] be active except the tongue put in
[1:25:06] motion by the Holy
[1:25:09] Spirit right now to another the
[1:25:12] interpretation tongu somebody speaks in
[1:25:13] tongues with an unction something behind
[1:25:15] it speaks in tongues to another the
[1:25:18] interpretation of tongues somebody's got
[1:25:19] to be there to interpret to listen to it
[1:25:22] and then speak it to interpret are to
[1:25:25] translate what has been spoken or
[1:25:27] written in a foreign tongue into the
[1:25:30] vernacular which is your language your
[1:25:32] own language right you hear on the tape
[1:25:35] somebody get up and they'll prophesy or
[1:25:36] they'll speak in tongues you can't you
[1:25:38] won't understand a word they're saying
[1:25:40] then all of a sudden brother R waits for
[1:25:43] just a few minutes or a few seconds
[1:25:44] sometimes brother or sister will pop up
[1:25:47] tell you exactly in English what what
[1:25:49] they that person was saying right see
[1:25:51] that's the spirit of God you
[1:25:53] can't the only problem
[1:25:55] is it can fall on the
[1:25:58] just and the unjust that's right that's
[1:26:01] why the Bible says prophecy will cease
[1:26:04] tongues will cease but charity will
[1:26:06] never
[1:26:07] cease but all these worketh that one and
[1:26:11] the self-same big ass Spirit dividing to
[1:26:14] every man severly as he will all right
[1:26:17] God will for as the body is one and hath
[1:26:20] many members all right body is one many
[1:26:22] members and all the members of that one
[1:26:24] body being many are one
[1:26:27] body many they're still one body for by
[1:26:31] one Spirit are we all baptized into one
[1:26:34] body whether we be Jews or Gentiles
[1:26:36] whether we be Bond or free and have been
[1:26:38] all made to drink into one spirit for
[1:26:42] the body is not one member but many
[1:26:45] right he's talking about
[1:26:47] us there is one body of
[1:26:50] Christ he's one but he has a many
[1:26:52] membered body sitting here in front of
[1:26:53] me today today is the bride
[1:26:57] right now listen to
[1:27:00] this the prophet tells us I think it's
[1:27:04] 1964 54 now this is the truth of God
[1:27:07] that's the truth anything contrary to
[1:27:08] that is not true but that is to the
[1:27:11] Nations to the people The Plan of
[1:27:12] Salvation but to the individual now
[1:27:15] watch then sometimes after God sending
[1:27:18] his word this way and ministers to
[1:27:20] preach it he sent to the church Apostles
[1:27:23] prophets Gifts of tongues interpretation
[1:27:25] of tongues that's all for the edifying
[1:27:27] or keeping
[1:27:29] clean of the church bringing the church
[1:27:32] together in other words separating out
[1:27:34] the evil right I don't I believe that
[1:27:37] every I believe that every thing speaks
[1:27:40] with tongues hasn't got the Holy Ghost
[1:27:42] but yet I believe the Holy Ghost can
[1:27:44] speak with tongues see sure but then if
[1:27:46] there be someone speak with tongues like
[1:27:48] a gift of speaking in tongues would
[1:27:50] speak in tongues then there'd be one
[1:27:52] interpreted well then that one then one
[1:27:56] that interpret it would speak something
[1:27:58] to one of the congregation or tell them
[1:28:00] something that happened three or four
[1:28:01] judge
[1:28:03] it get before the church the church
[1:28:05] accepts it see brother R tried to set
[1:28:07] the thing up where they wouldn't just do
[1:28:08] it in the in the sanctuary what you're
[1:28:10] supposed to do is is take it into a into
[1:28:12] a room and sit and wait for the Holy
[1:28:15] Ghost to fall one prophesy one interpret
[1:28:18] and they write it down sister June you
[1:28:20] better not go down this road because
[1:28:21] they're going to be a tree fell across
[1:28:22] the road that's the way it's supposed to
[1:28:24] work but the Pentecostals they couldn't
[1:28:25] help it I didn't bring the quote but
[1:28:28] y'all know a the quote that remember
[1:28:30] that woman every every night brother BR
[1:28:32] said I know she's fixing to stand up
[1:28:34] she's getting her garer ready she's
[1:28:35] pulling her you know she's getting
[1:28:37] everything ready she's slicking her hair
[1:28:38] back and she said he she quenched the
[1:28:40] spirit of the prayer line for two nights
[1:28:42] in a row and that's when he told her to
[1:28:44] sit down and shut up you're out of line
[1:28:47] and boy they didn't like
[1:28:50] that now that gift of Prophecy or gift
[1:28:52] of interpretation of things ought to be
[1:28:55] in every local
[1:28:56] body every local church should have it'
[1:28:59] be on one tonight on one on another one
[1:29:02] night not just one person all the time
[1:29:04] all right on another the next night
[1:29:07] another one the next night another one
[1:29:08] this time another one that time it's in
[1:29:10] every local
[1:29:13] body he said that's what the little
[1:29:15] breakup comes with the Pentecostal
[1:29:16] people about the lat rain movement
[1:29:18] there's quite a difference now watch
[1:29:19] he's trying to explain something there's
[1:29:21] quite a difference between a gift of
[1:29:22] Prophecy and a prophet
[1:29:24] amen all right they couldn't divide it
[1:29:26] in the Pentecostal churches they put
[1:29:29] them all together right a gift of
[1:29:32] Prophecy is in the church we just read
[1:29:33] what it was but a prophet is born a
[1:29:36] prophet that's the difference this man
[1:29:38] might prophesy tonight he might never
[1:29:41] prophesy no
[1:29:43] more it might be that that woman over
[1:29:45] there the next night this man back here
[1:29:47] and that one over there but when the
[1:29:49] gift of Prophecy is operating it cannot
[1:29:52] be received unless two or three judge it
[1:29:54] now listen you don't judge a
[1:29:58] prophet he's a Divine revealer of the
[1:30:00] word you can't judge a prophet God
[1:30:02] judges a
[1:30:03] prophet that's why brother Brown said I
[1:30:06] made a horrible mistake the angel came
[1:30:07] in the room told me I was preaching this
[1:30:09] wrong and make it
[1:30:11] right they ain't no cheer there ain't no
[1:30:14] uh Church uh Minister from another
[1:30:16] church come up and knocked on brother
[1:30:17] Baron's door and said you ain't
[1:30:18] preaching that
[1:30:20] right no God did it himself amen
[1:30:25] but a prophet singular p r o p h e t is
[1:30:28] born a prophet comes up a prophet
[1:30:30] everything he says in the name of the
[1:30:31] Lord is absolutely truth if he's
[1:30:34] prophesying but now it doesn't come by
[1:30:36] laying on of hands if you lay on hands I
[1:30:38] know what you're thinking about he must
[1:30:40] have discerned somebody's thought about
[1:30:42] the preser in the Bible that's just some
[1:30:45] boy who raised up in a church then they
[1:30:47] know he's going to be a preacher they
[1:30:48] see the gift working in his life then
[1:30:50] they have ordination service just like
[1:30:52] we did not long ago now now gift has to
[1:30:54] First be recognized to be in the Bible
[1:30:57] all right right then if God confirms
[1:31:00] that gift then it's true then he ought
[1:31:02] to believe that the man is true but if
[1:31:05] God doesn't testify of that gift now if
[1:31:08] he doesn't watch well then if that gift
[1:31:11] is testified by God then God gives the
[1:31:13] man the gift if God says so you have no
[1:31:16] right to doubt it well now a gift of
[1:31:18] Prophecy gift of discernment gift of
[1:31:21] wisdom gift of knowledge and all these
[1:31:22] things are divine nine gifts that set in
[1:31:25] the church and oh God grant today that
[1:31:27] when we call all these together come
[1:31:30] together and see all these nine
[1:31:31] spiritual gifts moving through the
[1:31:33] church operating the whole church body
[1:31:36] then we'll have the
[1:31:38] Rapture what's holding up the Rapture
[1:31:41] the nine Divine gifts working in the
[1:31:44] church if we can't have faith for Divine
[1:31:46] Healing how are we going to have faith
[1:31:47] for rapturing Faith the church has got a
[1:31:49] ways to go but I believe God will do it
[1:31:52] so do I he's doing it now
[1:31:54] now listen to this this is a few quotes
[1:31:56] and then we'll stop three Witnesses
[1:31:59] 1951 well now sometimes if the people if
[1:32:02] there's noise or excitement or something
[1:32:05] the holy spirit's very
[1:32:07] timid very timid just the least little
[1:32:10] thing grieve it
[1:32:14] away that's why I'm sorry I deal in the
[1:32:16] least little things if you don't come to

[1:32:31] to but I'm telling you what this ain't
[1:32:34] just what brother brandham

[1:33:20] want you to be reverent like you have
[1:33:22] plenty of time
[1:33:25] amen 1962 testimony on the seat brother
[1:33:28] Brown said be alert the holy spirit is
[1:33:31] very timid how many knows that very
[1:33:33] timid it just won't tolerate nothing
[1:33:37] wrong
[1:33:39] amen that's why you better clean it up
[1:33:41] when you walk through that
[1:33:47] door I mean come on people I know people

[1:34:30] minutes before the service starts you
[1:34:32] are hindering the service
[1:34:36] period period that's right brother R
[1:34:39] said 20 minutes one time he said 30
[1:34:41] minutes and you know why cuz he sees the
[1:34:44] Holy Spirit he saw people that were
[1:34:46] rushing in he saw people he could
[1:34:50] discern
[1:34:51] that it just won't tolerate nothing
[1:34:54] wrong now watch this identified Christ
[1:34:57] 1964 the holy spirit is timid now watch
[1:35:00] very very timid amen and where you have
[1:35:05] just one
[1:35:06] unbeliever or a skeptic sitting around
[1:35:10] the Holy Spirit just can't work
[1:35:12] hardly remember Jesus let a man Plum out
[1:35:15] of the city now listen this is the word
[1:35:17] himself this is God Almighty in human
[1:35:21] flesh he had to take somebody away away
[1:35:23] from an unbelieving house so he can heal
[1:35:26] him remember Jesus let a man Plum out of
[1:35:28] the city to heal him one time to get him
[1:35:31] away from
[1:35:34] unbelief he cannot do nothing against
[1:35:38] your
[1:35:41] belief you got to believe
[1:35:44] it 1959 quiny Sheba we'll be done just
[1:35:49] second he's talking about taking people
[1:35:52] this he was explaining really why they
[1:35:54] have prayer claws I mean uh prayer
[1:35:56] numbers prayer cards cuz you line them
[1:35:59] up you got a line you got what you don't
[1:36:01] have
[1:36:02] confusion right cuz even when remember
[1:36:06] that little woman that the her baby died
[1:36:07] the little Hispanic girl her baby died
[1:36:10] that morning he said it 12 ushers
[1:36:12] couldn't stop her they'd be trying to
[1:36:14] hold her and she'd run under the legs
[1:36:17] well she wanted a baby to well she got
[1:36:19] what she wanted
[1:36:21] right and they' break through the line
[1:36:23] and jump over one another run through
[1:36:25] the legs of the officers trying to get
[1:36:26] through why you you couldn't pray preach
[1:36:29] or pray for the sick like that there's
[1:36:31] too much confusion the holy spirit is
[1:36:34] timid everything must be decently and in
[1:36:37] order for the Holy
[1:36:40] Spirit that's why we don't have kids
[1:36:42] running that's why we don't talk unless
[1:36:43] we absolutely have to we don't talk
[1:36:44] while the service is going on or before
[1:36:46] the
[1:36:49] service there's a reason for that it's
[1:36:52] not just a law of the Ten Commandments
[1:36:54] written in something right yes sir I
[1:36:58] really wish well no I don't I was going
[1:37:00] to say I really wish one time God would
[1:37:02] open the portal and let us see into
[1:37:04] another dimension just for about 20
[1:37:06] minutes before service
[1:37:08] starts there wouldn't be nobody here and
[1:37:12] scare you to
[1:37:14] death I've seen it get on people I've
[1:37:17] not seen dark stuff but I've seen it get
[1:37:19] on people and change their change their
[1:37:21] U facial expression amen
[1:37:24] we need something to work on before the
[1:37:27] Holy Ghost can ever go to work he's got
[1:37:31] to have something to work
[1:37:35] with I know y'all quiet but please do
[1:37:38] you know that's right oh this Pharisee
[1:37:41] age that we're living in I tell you I'll
[1:37:44] never let a 10 seventh grade dummy tell
[1:37:47] me now he was a seventh grade educator
[1:37:48] he was talking about I come from so and
[1:37:50] so I got a college education but you
[1:37:52] haven't gotten gumption enough to how to
[1:37:55] control it maybe that might mean a lot
[1:37:58] different brother I'll tell you Paul had
[1:38:00] one too but he said he forgot everything
[1:38:02] he ever knew in order to find Christ the
[1:38:04] trouble of it the church needs today we
[1:38:06] need to dump all out a whole lot of
[1:38:08] stuff so we can be filled up
[1:38:12] again here was 120 green bottles setting
[1:38:16] up there talking about the day of
[1:38:17] Pentecost all of a sudden there came new
[1:38:19] wine from heaven like a rushing Mighty
[1:38:21] Wind it filled those little old green
[1:38:23] bottles until they got growing pains
[1:38:25] praise the Lord and they just bounced
[1:38:28] all over the country saying this is that
[1:38:30] brother if this ain't that I'm going to
[1:38:32] keep this till that
[1:38:34] comes what it takes to overcome all
[1:38:39] unbelief persones Apostles prophets
[1:38:42] teachers evangelist pastors these five
[1:38:44] god-given gifts in the church so each of
[1:38:46] you people who has a Godly Pastor has a
[1:38:48] gift from God in your church a Shepherd
[1:38:50] pastor means a Shepherd to watch over
[1:38:51] the flock teach them the word of God
[1:38:53] then these other nine different
[1:38:55] spiritual gifts should be operating in
[1:38:57] the church to keep the church clean like
[1:39:00] the Anan s of fire we talked about it
[1:39:02] Sunday it was a husband and wife team
[1:39:05] they conspired to
[1:39:07] lie
[1:39:09] amen and they both died for it they
[1:39:11] didn't lie to Peter Peter said you
[1:39:12] didn't lie to me you lied to the Holy
[1:39:14] Ghost because the Holy Ghost discerned
[1:39:15] it Peter probably didn't even know until
[1:39:18] they walked in and and God revealed it
[1:39:20] to him right remember brother Bown said
[1:39:23] what did I just say what the Holy Ghost
[1:39:25] took over and spoke through his through
[1:39:27] his vocal cords but ananas and Safar
[1:39:30] they held back a little bit of tithe
[1:39:31] maybe or maybe a little bit of something
[1:39:33] and but they both conspired to do it
[1:39:35] that's the whole deal and the Holy Ghost
[1:39:37] discerned it and they both lost their
[1:39:39] life and so forth the spirit of God rise
[1:39:42] up and call somebody out and tell them
[1:39:43] they're living wrong rebuke that sin
[1:39:45] openly boy we don't like that do we and
[1:39:48] that's what the holy spirit is in the
[1:39:49] church for to keep keep the church clean
[1:39:52] and ready for the coming of the Lord
[1:39:54] let's stand our feet God bless you come
[1:39:56] on
[1:40:00] musicians keeps the church perfect clean
[1:40:04] and ready for the coming of the
[1:40:08] Lord then you get down to where brother
[1:40:10] B said he said why don't you teach them
[1:40:12] these gifts brother B said I got to
[1:40:14] teach them their ABCs
[1:40:16] first
[1:40:18] before they don't have common decency
[1:40:20] enough to clean themselves up and act
[1:40:22] like Christians how you going to tell
[1:40:24] them spiritual things about Heavenly
[1:40:25] things that's right let the Pentecostal

[1:45:05] he was doing remember he said he was

[1:45:08] people's Spirit probably was so muddled
[1:45:10] up to he's trying to get through all the
[1:45:11] muddle to get to their Spirit but some
[1:45:13] people come up and he said oh I I see
[1:45:15] you're a Christian I I feel a a kindred
[1:45:17] spirit and he could just jump right in
[1:45:19] because they were believers they were
[1:45:21] they already had one part of it already
[1:45:22] done they were believing and he could
[1:45:25] just talk to them because the Holy
[1:45:26] Spirit was what was timid but it was
[1:45:27] right there but man let's don't grieve
[1:45:29] that thing and I didn't bring that quote
