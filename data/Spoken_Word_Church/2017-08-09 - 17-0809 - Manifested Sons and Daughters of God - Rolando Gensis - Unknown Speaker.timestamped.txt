[12:15] for their hospitality and I'm so sorry
[12:22] for my my English you might be thinking
[12:27] that the Filipinos are they are good in
[12:30] English just like you just listening or
[12:34] hearing from a storable Danny they're
[12:39] engineers and English teacher but me
[12:43] I've added in the hub in education my
[12:47] parents has sent me to to college but
[12:50] during the time I was so obsessed in
[12:54] playing guitar so I did not my father my
[13:01] mother they are thinking that I am
[13:02] studying my the course that they want me
[13:08] to Olivia but I studied what I wanted to
[13:15] study so to learn so but I'm glad that
[13:20] the Lord had given me a few English
[13:23] Alleluia so before I ran ran out of
[13:27] English will now go to the to the Word
[13:31] of God the Reading Road of God and if
[13:34] you have a Bible with you please turn it
[13:36] with me
[13:37] this request everybody to please stand
[13:41] and open it with me in the book of
[13:47] Romans chapter 8 and beginning at verse
[13:50] 14 to 19 which says for as many as are
[13:58] led by the Spirit of God they are the
[14:00] sons of God for we have not received the
[14:04] spirit of bondage again to fear but have
[14:07] received the spirit of adoption we
[14:10] by we cry about father the spirit itself
[14:15] beareth witness with our spirit that we
[14:18] are the children of God and if children
[14:20] then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs
[14:24] with Christ if so be that we suffer with
[14:28] him that we may be also glorified
[14:30] together for I reckon that the
[14:33] sufferings of this present time are not
[14:35] worthy to be compared with the glory
[14:37] which shall be revealed in us for the
[14:41] earnest expectation of the creature
[14:43] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[14:47] sons of God
[14:48] may the Lord other placing upon the
[14:51] reading of this word and would you
[14:55] please pray yeah
[15:03] yes mana the words you have no speaker
[15:07] hoping are understanding what we need
[15:11] literally no y-yes Lauren gash's amen
[15:20] you may be seated in the presence of the
[15:22] Lord Alleluia tonight that I would like
[15:25] to share to you a topic the manifested
[15:32] sons and daughters of God Alleluia and
[15:40] in the message maybe tonight I will be
[15:44] reading some quotations because if I
[15:50] just if I just keep on talking and
[15:52] talking maybe I will run out of English
[15:55] I have a lot of English but the problem
[15:58] is I don't know how to talk on the
[16:00] connect them all so I'll go yeah
[16:05] in the message crisis the mystery of God
[16:09] revealed it says now notice again now
[16:13] what is trifold purpose manifests itself
[16:18] in Jesus Christ to come in the body by
[16:22] Jesus Christ to
[16:24] have the preeminence 'as to what restore
[16:28] back Eden bring back what which lost
[16:33] Olivia that was the only thing out of
[16:36] order all the rest of his of these
[16:40] things was in order
[16:43] hallelujah so there is something that
[16:46] was lost in order hallelujah and this is
[16:52] you know the purpose of God in sending a
[16:59] message it's not for us to have a strong
[17:04] doctrine firm religion that we can stand
[17:08] in any kind of argument area but God
[17:12] hallelujah he sent us a message in these
[17:15] last days
[17:16] hallelujah to gather his elect to gather
[17:19] his children and to let us know what is
[17:22] our position
[17:24] Alvia who we are in God hallelujah and
[17:28] to know our position in God Alleluia and
[17:32] I in the put in paragraph 240 and the
[17:36] same message crisis the mystery of God
[17:38] well it says the new birth is Christ
[17:41] it's a revelation God has revealed to
[17:45] you this great mystery and that's a new
[17:48] birth now what are you going to do when
[17:51] you get all that group together where
[17:54] the revelation is perfectly in harmony
[17:56] and God expressing it through his word
[17:59] by the same options the same things that
[18:03] he did making the word manifest oh if
[18:06] the church only knew its position so
[18:10] there is a position that the church
[18:12] should know if the chose only knew its
[18:15] position it will one day then the
[18:19] rapture will go when it knows what it is
[18:22] Alleluia so ah to manifest itself in
[18:27] Jesus Christ to come into the body of by
[18:30] Jesus Christ and to have the preeminence
[18:32] over his shorts Alleluia it means to say
[18:35] that the church must be in
[18:37] in total obedience Alleluia hallelujah -
[18:43] to the bridegroom Alleluia
[18:45] and then Alleluia
[18:49] what's the reason why we lose the
[18:51] position because hallelujah of
[18:54] disobedience disbelief hallelujah and
[18:57] when we win we win we win we come back
[18:59] into that original condition then God
[19:02] will restore us back hallelujah - Eden
[19:05] bring us back hallelujah - that which he
[19:08] said bring back that which was lost
[19:11] el riih so it is only in this message
[19:14] that we knew hallelujah we learned
[19:18] hallelujah where we come from and who we
[19:22] are and where we are going
[19:24] Alleluia and by knowing our position
[19:29] Allah we are it will give us a
[19:32] confidence
[19:34] Alvia so up Alleluia what we should what
[19:40] we should have - up or what we should do
[19:44] like like for example in the Philippines
[19:48] we still use this you know this tropic
[19:51] enforcers but here in America you have
[19:54] all these traffic lights but in the
[19:58] Philippines especially in my place we
[20:01] still use this a manual tricycle you
[20:04] know with bicycle and the sidecar and
[20:10] most of them are farmers farmers in the
[20:16] Philippines are different than the
[20:18] farmers in the US we cut grass like you
[20:22] have seen on the picture we cut dress
[20:25] pass it by Bible loose in this mud city
[20:28] you know and then if they will plant a
[20:31] potato we have to wait for three months
[20:34] until the kernel you can eat the potato
[20:38] so they prefer to go to the city and
[20:43] drive this tricycle after going around
[20:47] the city for several hours they can they
[20:49] can buy rice
[20:51] Alleluia so they don't know how the
[20:54] traffic rules
[20:55] most of them doesn't know the traffic
[20:59] rules and I know a policeman who is a
[21:02] friend of mine and you know he's a
[21:05] policeman but you know he was uh he was
[21:08] maybe he is ashamed - standing out in
[21:12] the middle of the street and he was so
[21:15] hesitant doing his job
[21:18] and he was even hit by hallelujah but I
[21:27] used to see some a civilian who are odd
[21:33] who were given this authority to be a
[21:36] traffic enforcer and they also you know
[21:39] they are so confident and even dancing
[21:43] while doing the traffic you know and
[21:45] because they know their position
[21:48] Alleluia and when they blow that whistle
[21:51] even the big trucks and buses window
[21:54] their hands like that it will stop
[21:56] because we are so confident we are
[21:58] acting in a right Alleluia
[22:01] in a right way they are standing in a
[22:04] right position and there they know their
[22:06] position earlier so once we you know
[22:09] your position you really believe who you
[22:13] are Alleluia
[22:14] you will have B the D you'll have the
[22:18] the courage you have the the confidence
[22:23] hallelujah - hallelujah of who you are
[22:27] Alleluia so under religion did nutella's
[22:33] Alleluia about that it's only the
[22:36] message tells us that we are we are we
[22:40] come from we came from God Alleluia
[22:43] and you know in order for you to be a
[22:45] son like for example they have five sons
[22:49] and I have two daughters Alleluia
[22:54] they were not only my daughters when
[22:57] they were born but before they were born
[22:59] we were not my children when they were
[23:01] born but before they were born they were
[23:04] with me
[23:05] my loins hallelujah and we are not only
[23:08] sons and daughters of God when we
[23:11] receive hallelujah the Word of God but
[23:14] before the foundation of the world we
[23:16] are a gene we are acid in his thinking
[23:19] and if you are a part of him hallelujah
[23:22] if you are a part of him then one day
[23:24] you will hallelujah like like your
[23:29] children hallelujah you release that sin
[23:32] hallelujah but one day Allah we have in
[23:34] the manifested once one purpose is so
[23:39] that you can have fellowship hallelujah
[23:42] so that's the same thing with God
[23:44] hallelujah
[23:45] and if you are a seed of God you're part
[23:48] of this thinking you're part of bestowed
[23:49] which is the word hallelujah I believe
[23:54] that even Jesus said in the beginning
[23:57] was the word and the Word was with God
[23:58] in John 1:1 and the Word was God and
[24:01] Jesus said hallelujah I came from God
[24:04] and I go back to God and I believe it's
[24:07] the same thing hallelujah with the
[24:09] children of God hallelujah now it Romans
[24:13] let's continue reading in verse 17
[24:17] Romans 8:17 Arabs children then heirs
[24:25] heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ
[24:28] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[24:32] may also glorified together so jointers
[24:36] means to say ah like equal sharing
[24:40] hallelujah and if he is going to reign
[24:44] we will also ring hallelujah but if he
[24:51] suffered Alleluia
[24:53] not only to reign but we also have to
[24:57] suffer with him hallelujah and verse 18
[25:04] for I reckon that the sufferings of this
[25:06] present time are not worthy to be
[25:07] compared with the glory which shall be
[25:09] revealed in us that the sufferings of
[25:13] this present time
[25:14] Alleluia a short time with a little
[25:16] sufferings you know
[25:18] your sufferance could not be compared
[25:20] earlier to what he suffered for us a
[25:23] little time a short time with a little
[25:27] suffering are not worthy to be compared
[25:29] with the glory hallelujah that shall be
[25:33] revealed even burnham when he saw data
[25:36] in a God allowed him
[25:39] Alleluia told to experience beyond the
[25:42] curtain of time only I said there is no
[25:46] word Alleluia
[25:49] that could be uttered to utter
[25:52] hallelujah and even even the Apostle
[25:55] Paul he said I knew a man
[25:58] Alleluia I knew a man he did not say
[26:01] that I am I am that man he said I knew a
[26:05] man I don't know whether it is in the
[26:08] body or out of the body hallelujah that
[26:12] was he was caught up into the third
[26:14] heaven and oh my when he saw hallelujah
[26:18] the things that Alleluia and he even
[26:22] said I rather to be absent if not only
[26:26] for the ministry I rather to be to be
[26:29] there hallelujah
[26:30] I prefer to be there but because of the
[26:33] ministry that's only the reason that I
[26:35] am here he said I rather to be absent in
[26:38] the body
[26:38] Alleluia in order to be present with the
[26:41] Lord hallelujah so you know you
[26:44] hallelujah
[26:46] cannot be compared Alleluia cannot be
[26:50] compared with the glory which shall be
[26:51] revealed in us
[26:53] Alleluia verse 19 for the earnest
[26:57] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[27:00] the manifestation of the sons of God
[27:03] means to say that the creator or the
[27:06] creation are expecting earnestly
[27:11] Alleluia the earnest expectation of the
[27:14] creature waiteth for the manifestation
[27:16] of the sons of God
[27:18] we are expecting earnestly they are
[27:22] waiting for the further God to be the
[27:25] ruler again Alleluia because when God
[27:30] made man
[27:31] creative man in in Genesis chapter 1
[27:34] verse 26 he said let us make man in our
[27:38] own image after our likeness so what if
[27:42] God is that's that's the man
[27:46] it has make man in our own image after
[27:49] our likeness and let them have dominion
[27:52] and let him up to view alleluia Dominion
[27:58] hallelujah he was God
[28:00] bo burnham said he was God he was a he
[28:04] was the authority and we have to subdue
[28:07] the earth
[28:07] Alleluia what he wants if he said okay
[28:11] you you met with play you are not
[28:14] supposed to be there you move this way
[28:16] Byron said he can he have those the
[28:19] power and authority Alleluia that even
[28:22] the tree would obey Him Alleluia the
[28:25] fish Alleluia da all the beasts Alleluia
[28:29] the lion Alleluia but he lost that
[28:35] authority before in II said okay this
[28:40] portion you give me eggplant
[28:44] Alleluia and this portion you give me
[28:48] tomato and the earth because it was
[28:51] under his ax
[28:52] he's his rulership under his Dominion it
[28:56] obeyed him Alleluia and then when he
[29:00] said lion come here the lion will come
[29:03] Alleluia because everything is under his
[29:07] Alleluia rulership being the god of this
[29:11] earth Reverend said the God is the god
[29:14] of unic of the universe and hallelujah
[29:17] Edom was the god of this small portion
[29:20] of the universe which is the earth but
[29:23] when Adam fell we need said okay this
[29:29] portion here you give me a plant and it
[29:32] grows thorns and thistles
[29:35] he could that he could not hallelujah
[29:39] have the Dominion he didn't have the
[29:42] power anymore Alvia okay
[29:45] in here you give me tomato it gives
[29:49] thorns and thistles this undesirable
[29:53] grasses mean is a lie on the mir then
[29:57] the lion was a drag
[29:58] Alleluia and Satan became the god of

[37:55] the children of God and especially if
[37:58] you are a children of God the enemy
[38:00] Alleluia the opposition is always doing
[38:04] something hallelujah
[38:07] now I want to read another quotation in
[38:12] the message the Messiah is it when God
[38:16] made man in Genesis 1:26 it shows if you
[38:20] are putting the scripture down in his
[38:23] 1:26 it shows that God made man to be a
[38:27] god named og Natalija to be a god to
[38:31] begin with man was made to be a God a
[38:36] lesser God when he was made in the
[38:41] image and likeness of God in likeness of
[38:44] God and he had hand like God he had feet
[38:47] like God eyes ears and intelligence like
[38:49] like God
[38:50] so other animals they don't have this
[38:53] intelligence only only the man that can
[38:56] imagine I can can his mind can hold this
[39:00] mini plans can remember
[39:03] hallelujah can compute hallelujah
[39:05] because we are made in the image of God
[39:11] Alleluia and intelligence his whole
[39:15] fiber because he was a son of God and I
[39:18] believe that if you are son of God I
[39:20] believe that you are God because if your
[39:26] if your if your mother is big I believe
[39:29] that the Alleluia that the child is also
[39:38] big hallelujah and if the mother and the
[39:41] father is dog the chalice dog Alleluia
[39:44] if it is called
[39:45] that the child is cow and if your father
[39:48] is God I believe called via the pure God
[39:51] Alleluia so that's our original position
[39:55] or the original position of man and even
[39:59] Jesus Christ
[40:00] Alleluia said that in John chapter 10
[40:03] verse 33 to 36 says the Jews answered
[40:12] him saying for a good work we stone thee
[40:14] not but for blasphemy and because thou
[40:17] that thou being a man makest thyself God
[40:22] jesus answered answered them it is not
[40:25] written in your law I said Ye are gods
[40:48] it is not written in your law I said Ye
[40:52] are gods
[40:52] if he called them gods unto whom the
[40:57] word of god came so who are these that
[41:00] are being called God are those people
[41:05] whom the Word of God came and I believe
[41:09] that the message is the Word of God for
[41:12] this day and this research is not for
[41:15] everybody
[41:16] Alleluia and if you receive this message
[41:19] if this mission is sent for you Olivia
[41:23] and Jesus Christ said Alleluia if he
[41:28] called them gods unto whom the Word of
[41:31] God came so if the word of God came to
[41:34] you if you receive the message
[41:37] Alleluia then I believe your God the
[41:42] Bible told you gods hallelujah if he
[41:46] called them God's home unto whom the
[41:48] Word of God came and the scripture
[41:50] cannot be broken say of him whom the
[41:54] father had sacrificed sanctified and
[41:57] sent into the world that though
[42:00] blasphemous because I said I am the son
[42:03] of God and even in in sam tsui verse 82
[42:07] chapter 8 to double 6 I have said Ye are
[42:11] gods
[42:11] smoochie and all of you are children of
[42:14] the Most High
[42:17] Alleluia now in each of those chapter 7
[42:21] verse 1 it says and the Lord said unto
[42:26] Moses I see
[42:28] see I have made thee a gun smoochie I
[42:32] have media got to Pharaoh an errand a
[42:35] brother shall be thy prophet now Moses
[42:40] what's the prophet of God and of course
[42:46] God is the God and Moses is the prophet
[42:49] and then in this in this sin God said
[42:55] okay Moses I am the God and you are the
[42:59] prophet but now you will be the Guardian
[43:02] our own shall be your prophet hallelujah
[43:06] so in Versailles in Exodus chapter 4
[43:09] verse 16 is it and he shall be died he
[43:13] shall be legs spokesman and to the
[43:16] people and he shall be he shall and even
[43:24] he shall be to be instead of a mouse now
[43:27] Moses Aaron shall be the prophet it
[43:31] shall be the mouth hallelujah and thou
[43:33] shall be to him instead of God and Moses
[43:38] you will be the god now musa Aaron will
[43:40] be no your prophet he said Moses a
[43:43] prophet and then here is God now God
[43:46] said okay
[43:46] Moses you will be the god and then
[43:49] hallelujah Aaron shall be your prophet
[43:52] hallelujah and we'll God we know that at
[43:56] that time there is no redemption yet
[44:00] hallelujah there is no redemption yet a
[44:03] true Redemption by the blood of Jesus
[44:05] Christ they were under blood the blood
[44:08] of goats and bulls but when God gave
[44:12] Moses a chance to be a god hallelujah
[44:15] and Aaron is yeah what is profit when
[44:20] Moses said price
[44:21] hallelujah the price obeyed I know the
[44:25] last been the water became blood Olivia
[44:29] even de and originally I became a dry
[44:32] ground everything that makes your open
[44:34] Moses hallelujah because he was given a
[44:38] chance to be a gun only although man was
[44:43] in a fooling condition earlier but when
[44:46] God gave dad a chance into a a sinful
[44:51] man hallelujah to be a god and then we
[44:55] know Alvia that even nature's obeyed
[44:59] Moses because he was God hallelujah now
[45:04] in a missions hear ye him all things are
[45:09] possible to them that believe
[45:11] so we know that men had fallen to see
[45:16] because of unbelief el riih and here he
[45:20] says all things and the Bible also said
[45:22] all things are possible to them the
[45:24] believe we've got the anti resources of
[45:28] God at our hands to display God we are
[45:33] sons and daughters of God when God made
[45:37] man he made him a god he gave him a
[45:41] dominion over the earth but his fallen
[45:44] state dropped up but what they lost by
[45:49] Adam it was restored by Christ
[45:53] Alleluia so in general in Genesis
[45:57] chapter 126 when God made man he made
[45:59] him a god is moji he gave him a Dominion
[46:03] and rulership and had power over the
[46:05] birds of the air over the cattle of the
[46:07] field over God over the wind

[54:57] and sisters although they lost it
[55:00] although the children of God like like
[55:04] Israel in Israel
[55:08] Alleluia when you know in enough when we
[55:14] win the interred into the Promised Land
[55:19] God had allotted for its family and
[55:24] inheritance this is your inheritance and
[55:28] for the children and the children and
[55:30] the children did not work for it they
[55:35] inherited from their forefathers but
[55:40] when they you know me Manila's me Reuben

[55:53] not pay my dates anymore
[55:55] okay here is my children yo I will give
[56:00] it to you as like as a slave and then
[56:06] though he became my slave he lost his
[56:11] inheritance but he didn't lose his right
[56:16] being and his realized
[56:18] hallelujah although we are born
[56:20] hallelujah
[56:23] in sin because of our parents but our
[56:29] rights being son of God we never lost it
[56:33] hallelujah but here is and I slave in
[56:40] Israel but he would not be a slave
[56:43] forever there will be a time if he if he
[56:48] has a relative who is Allah who is
[56:51] wealthy he could the relative could
[56:56] redeem him
[56:58] Alleluia or else when the Jubilee year
[57:03] comes when the trumpet ee Trump is being
[57:08] blood blown hallelujah he could walk
[57:12] free hallelujah and go home hallelujah
[57:16] and visa he's a master have no dominion
[57:20] over him anymore he could go home and
[57:23] fellowship with his loved ones with his
[57:27] family with his father Alleluia and
[57:29] Sangha hallelujah although that
[57:33] inheritance of ours we will lost that
[57:37] authority but thank God we have a
[57:41] kinsman redeemer at the same time we
[57:45] heard hallelujah that Jubilee trumpet
[57:47] the gospel trumpet Alleluia and that
[57:50] gospel trumpet will give us hallelujah
[57:53] deliverance Alleluia and it will give us
[57:57] hallelujah it will bring us into our
[58:00] rightful position into our authority an
[58:04] hour into our inheritance hallelujah and
[58:09] in Ephesians chapter 1 chapter 1 verse 4
[58:16] to verse 7 says according I said chosen
[58:19] us in him before the foundation of the
[58:20] world that we should be holy and without
[58:22] blame before him in love having
[58:25] predicted us 'introduction of children
[58:27] so having produced method there would be
[58:31] a time Alleluia
[58:33] that you will be an adopted children
[58:35] by Jesus Christ to himself according to
[58:39] the good pleasure of his will so we know
[58:42] that the adoption in this is nice not
[58:44] like that option here in the Philippines
[58:47] in America that if the couple didn't
[58:51] have any children they can go to those
[58:55] families that have a lot of children I
[58:58] have a lot of children but I will not
[59:00] give one and then they will adopt
[59:06] Alleluia one and that will consider them
[59:10] as their own as their own son or as
[59:12] their own daughter but the adoption in
[59:15] this is different
[59:16] early adoption in this is it is their
[59:20] own son but the Bible said that as long
[59:25] as the child is is yet young he is no
[59:33] different than the servant he is under
[59:37] tutor there will be one which will teach
[59:40] him teach him how to how to grow as a
[59:43] you know a businessman Ora so he could
[59:46] manage a hallelujah what his parents the
[59:53] property bees parents hallelujah
[59:56] and when this son became matured and the
[1:00:02] tutorials since that these are enough he
[1:00:06] is good enough to manage the business of
[1:00:09] his father then he will go to the master
[1:00:11] he said your son is now Alleluia he's
[1:00:15] now he's responsible he is now hakoda
[1:00:18] he's good enough to manage your your
[1:00:21] your properties your businesses and then
[1:00:25] the father will make a hallelujah will
[1:00:28] make a party and during that party he
[1:00:31] will proclaim hallelujah that from this
[1:00:34] from this time on my son is now an
[1:00:39] adopted son anything that he will say
[1:00:43] you will be he can manage whatever
[1:00:49] I have his word is my word if he sign a
[1:00:54] check
[1:00:54] hallelujah it seems that I am the one
[1:00:56] who signed the check Alvia so he can do
[1:00:59] the Father's business hallelujah and we
[1:01:02] are chosen we are participated and
[1:01:05] adoption of children for what hallelujah
