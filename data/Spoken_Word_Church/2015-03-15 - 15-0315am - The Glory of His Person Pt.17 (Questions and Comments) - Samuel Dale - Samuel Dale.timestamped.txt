[7:09] we pray the lord would bless us all
[7:11] right
[7:12] i think he's at all announcements
[7:16] we always miss something so
[7:18] definitely father we thank you lord for
[7:20] your grace your love your understanding
[7:23] thank you for all things we just asked
[7:26] you this morning that you would come
[7:27] among us in a mighty way in order that
[7:30] you would open your word unto us that we
[7:32] may see you
[7:34] and follow after
[7:35] lord then through that opening of the
[7:37] word we know and realize you said you
[7:40] would send your word and heal us
[7:42] and deliver us from destruction
[7:44] there's many things among us many
[7:47] sicknesses and many things that are
[7:49] going on that satan is just hindered on
[7:52] ever hindering on every hand that he can
[7:55] but we pray that you would just come on
[7:57] the scene because you said it and we
[7:58] believe it said when the enemy comes in
[8:01] like a flood you'd raise up a standard
[8:03] so thank you lord for the standard just
[8:06] make yourself manifest now among us have
[8:08] your way as we read your word you come
[8:10] and bless us and guide us forgive our
[8:12] sins and bless each one bless wade lord
[8:15] as he's winding down there in jamaica
[8:18] and be i mean in the philippines and
[8:20] he'll be flying back in
[8:22] coming home tuesday the lord willing and
[8:24] we pray that you'd bless in all things
[8:26] he's given some good reports
[8:28] and we believe you and we thank you in
[8:31] jesus name amen
[8:36] we'll
[8:37] read these and then we'll
[8:38] just have comments and questions and
[8:40] things
[8:43] revelations 1 12 it says and i turned to
[8:46] see the voice that spake with me and
[8:48] being turned i saw seven golden
[8:50] candlesticks and in the midst of the
[8:52] seven candlesticks one like unto the son
[8:54] of man
[8:56] clove the garment down to the foot and
[8:58] gird about the palps with a golden
[9:00] girdle
[9:01] now some of the visitors may say well
[9:03] hey he read that the last
[9:05] time i was here
[9:07] and you come back in another three
[9:09] months and i'll probably read it again
[9:12] because we're
[9:13] we haven't yet got to the point that
[9:15] we're wanting to
[9:17] own this
[9:18] you know the glory of his person
[9:20] but we'll get there eventually all right
[9:24] genesis 1 26
[9:26] and god said let us make man in our
[9:28] image after our likeness and let them
[9:30] have dominion
[9:31] over the fish of the sea and over the
[9:33] fowl of the air and over the cattle and
[9:34] over all the earth and over every
[9:36] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[9:38] earth
[9:39] so god created man in his own image and
[9:41] the image of god created he him
[9:45] male and female created he them notice
[9:48] now created he him them that's all
[9:51] but just keep that in mind okay so we'll
[9:54] go on over to the points where we can
[9:56] cover the
[9:57] up to where we're at genesis 2 7
[10:01] and the lord god formed man of the dust
[10:04] of the ground and breathed into his
[10:05] nostrils the breath of life
[10:08] and man became a living soul and the
[10:10] lord
[10:12] the lord god planted a garden eastward
[10:14] in eden and there he put the man whom he
[10:17] had formed amen you may be seated
[10:20] the lord add his blessing to the
[10:23] reading of the word
[10:25] now we'll try to just speak for a little
[10:28] bit and
[10:29] cover some things and just review and
[10:31] then
[10:32] you write down your questions and all
[10:34] and we'll try to have
[10:35] you know questions and comments upon
[10:38] what we're talking about
[10:43] what has been our thought for all of
[10:45] this time
[10:46] you know basically covering
[10:49] is to see how real that god is
[10:53] you know
[10:54] you say well brother dale all of my life
[10:56] i've just heard god as a spirit well
[10:58] that's good that's bible
[11:01] but do you think he's just a spirit to
[11:03] just
[11:04] no form
[11:06] i mean back before the foundation of the
[11:08] world as we talked of back in the
[11:10] eternities where brother brown said he
[11:13] was elohim and dwelt alone you know
[11:16] are you thinking it was just a spirit
[11:18] back there
[11:21] well remember the prophet says we
[11:23] covered these things that god is a being
[11:26] he is not like the wind
[11:30] he is a person
[11:32] all right think of god as being real
[11:35] as i say to you you mean to think that
[11:38] you
[11:38] are something
[11:40] well then whatever who created is
[11:42] greater than you are no matter what
[11:45] greatness we think we are
[11:47] there has to be a creator all right
[11:50] and in seeing that we've seen that he
[11:54] he wanted to reveal himself
[11:57] so he began to condescend downward to
[11:59] where that he would be able to make
[12:02] known himself because how would we
[12:04] understand as the prophet said the one
[12:06] who covers all space and time and
[12:08] eternity how could you comprehend god
[12:12] the best you do is the spirit
[12:16] well i hope that that's
[12:18] sunk in enough on you to talk about a
[12:20] spiritual being
[12:22] instead of just a spirit like the wind
[12:24] just blowing around and just because
[12:26] remember
[12:28] he is not omnipresent
[12:32] because he's a being
[12:34] that's the way the prophet explained it
[12:36] now he is omnipresent only in the basis
[12:40] that he's omniscient
[12:43] that he knows all things
[12:45] and by knowing all things then he can be
[12:49] wherever he needs to be right to be
[12:52] present all right but he's a being
[12:54] that's that's my point my whole thought
[12:56] is to try to get us to looking at the
[12:58] reality of god
[13:00] and seeing how real he is
[13:04] maybe you'd never considered god as
[13:06] being a person but why not
[13:09] he is the only person
[13:11] i like the way the prophet said it one
[13:12] day he said he's not the second third
[13:15] person second person he said he's not
[13:17] even the first person
[13:21] he said he is the person
[13:24] all right because he's the first person
[13:26] that could mean there can be more
[13:27] persons
[13:28] but when he's the only person then
[13:31] there's only one true and living god we
[13:33] don't believe in trinitarianism we claim
[13:36] to be away from that as to believe the
[13:38] message of the hour and and you know
[13:41] settling down to that point that we say
[13:43] we believe in one god
[13:45] well how do you believe about that god
[13:48] what is your thoughts about that god
[13:51] as i always say is your god real
[13:55] well i've never seen him
[13:59] well you probably never will in that
[14:01] attitude
[14:04] but why not look around because as we
[14:06] covered the scripture
[14:08] that even the eternal godhead
[14:10] can be understood by the things that we
[14:13] see
[14:16] you know
[14:16] look out in life and look at the birds
[14:18] the animals the trees and things
[14:21] then you realize there's got to be a
[14:23] creator somewhere
[14:25] for all of that to come from all right
[14:28] well see he's real
[14:31] he's a person right
[14:33] it's not just something that we well you
[14:36] know
[14:37] i don't know where he's at i don't know
[14:38] what you can talk to him anytime you
[14:40] want to
[14:42] telephones never busy
[14:45] all you got to do is dial him up start
[14:47] praying
[14:48] all right
[14:49] because he'll be there when you want him
[14:51] to be there
[14:53] but he's real
[14:54] all right then we found out to to try to
[14:57] jump over hurry and back up some to the
[15:00] man
[15:01] we found out that
[15:04] god never sent a son to die
[15:08] he came
[15:10] himself then you'll say well my god
[15:13] can't die
[15:16] well
[15:19] you tell me what happened
[15:22] see as i always try to tell you
[15:25] i can cut i can blow your head slap off
[15:28] but i can't kill you
[15:31] because you're going to go somewhere
[15:32] else
[15:33] and you're going to abide until god can
[15:35] do that because he's the only one that
[15:37] can destroy the soul of mankind
[15:40] but see then one day he came and when
[15:43] the fall came then he came in human
[15:46] flesh
[15:47] to live up on earth
[15:49] and the bible said in him dwelt the
[15:51] fullness of the godhead
[15:52] bodily all right
[15:55] in him was father son and holy ghost
[15:58] dwelling there because that's what it
[16:00] takes now and remember how we express
[16:02] that
[16:03] if you do away with either one father
[16:05] son holy ghost see then you're going to
[16:08] make it either a trinity or you're going
[16:10] to make it a oneness
[16:13] me
[16:15] but just don't do that leave it the way
[16:16] it is you've got to have father son and
[16:18] holy ghost to make the one true and
[16:20] living god
[16:21] that's not three persons
[16:24] that's not three uh personalities or
[16:26] anything
[16:28] that's three manifestations of the same
[16:30] god
[16:31] all right
[16:32] i'm a human the things we see we can see
[16:35] the eternal god i'm a human i'm a father
[16:38] i'm a
[16:39] you know a grandfather
[16:41] i can have many many manifestations
[16:43] about me
[16:44] but i'm only one person
[16:46] all right we claim to believe those but
[16:48] do we make him then real
[16:52] well i don't know maybe when we get up
[16:55] to heaven we'll see him well that's true
[16:57] if that's our thoughts that's the only
[16:59] place we'll see him
[17:01] and he might be sitting on the throne
[17:02] somewhere judging us too so that might
[17:05] be the wrong way to get to see him
[17:08] all right
[17:08] see i believe he's real
[17:11] it wasn't on the day of pentecost that
[17:13] the baptism of the holy ghost just
[17:15] floated down and just like the wind you
[17:17] know it says it it set on each one of
[17:20] them
[17:23] in tongues of fire
[17:26] on each one
[17:27] he's real
[17:29] all right well see when he come into
[17:30] human flesh
[17:33] we don't look at that as being a three
[17:35] god idea
[17:37] we see that god was in christ the bible
[17:40] said reconcile in the world and to
[17:41] himself
[17:42] all right
[17:43] then we look at it as being that he was
[17:46] the one that was the creator because
[17:49] remember now
[17:51] you remember how we brought it out
[17:55] because you talk about a creation you
[17:57] got to have a creator
[17:58] and remember according to john 1
[18:01] hebrews 1
[18:03] colossians 1
[18:05] james 3 and 9
[18:07] all things were made by him
[18:11] and he's the word right he was the word
[18:14] that made all things all right that's
[18:16] jesus christ not jesus of flesh
[18:20] there's no such thing
[18:21] all right see then you can't have
[18:23] eternal sonships
[18:26] that won't work
[18:27] but you can have he got eternal godship
[18:31] you can have an eternal godhead
[18:34] because that's who he is
[18:36] all right
[18:38] see then we'd look at him as being real
[18:41] and find out the reality of
[18:42] understanding god
[18:44] and and
[18:45] you know
[18:47] standing there with and to who was it
[18:49] philip he said
[18:50] you know show us the father that it
[18:52] suffice or satisfy us he said have i
[18:54] been so long with you
[18:58] he said if you've seen me you've seen
[18:59] the father
[19:01] you know what right there stood the
[19:02] father in flesh
[19:05] all right
[19:06] now we brought it out in a little bit
[19:08] but didn't bring out much because we're
[19:09] going to hit on a little bit more in
[19:11] some more messages
[19:13] but you see then he was what body of
[19:16] creation
[19:18] hebrews 10 5 a body thou hast prepared
[19:20] me all right
[19:22] but in soul he was god amen
[19:26] in spirit he was god
[19:29] so that wasn't just an ordinary man
[19:31] standing there
[19:35] we'll get back to it in a minute
[19:36] remember adam was had to be body spirit
[19:40] and soul adam
[19:41] then god breathed into his nostrils and
[19:44] he'd become a living soul
[19:45] but jesus wasn't just body spirit and
[19:48] soul or something like a body in
[19:51] and a spirit or something and then a
[19:53] soul came in he was soul and spirit both
[19:57] eternal god
[19:59] the spirit that was in him was the
[20:00] spirit in sundry times and in diverse
[20:03] manners according to hebrews that spoke
[20:05] to in the prophets
[20:08] all right so it wasn't just a human
[20:10] being standing there
[20:13] it was the eternal god
[20:16] might manifest
[20:18] as i said a moment ago then he didn't
[20:19] send a son to die
[20:22] he came himself
[20:24] he said well now you're going into
[20:26] you're trying to get us away from
[20:27] trinity but it looks like you're going
[20:29] into oneness no
[20:32] as long as you hold it to the point of
[20:34] father son and holy spirit
[20:38] you know
[20:40] and keep that in manifestations you
[20:42] won't go into the oneness doctrine
[20:45] but if you don't you've already gone
[20:47] there
[20:50] because the one that's doctor is one
[20:51] like your finger
[20:55] that's basically all it did old
[20:57] testament
[20:58] new testament back there with jesus and
[21:01] now
[21:02] see and that there's never another
[21:05] uh form of god outside of jesus christ
[21:07] but i differ with that point there
[21:08] because highly with the oneness on that
[21:11] one because i that's where i see they
[21:13] totally go wrong right
[21:14] the oneness believed that jesus was the
[21:16] life's manifestation of god i don't
[21:18] believe that i believe on the day of
[21:20] pentecost the bride become a
[21:21] manifestation of god
[21:23] right i believe that holy ghost being
[21:25] still given to us as a new birth makes
[21:28] us a manifestation of god
[21:31] i don't believe it ended there see
[21:32] that's oneness
[21:34] all right
[21:35] so then you come into to trying to
[21:38] understand see that when we're not
[21:39] trinity we're not oneness
[21:42] we're staying with the scripture of one
[21:44] true and living god
[21:46] but made manifest in many forms
[21:50] because remember he had many attributes
[21:54] in him
[21:56] that was for the foundation of the world
[21:58] that was back when he was
[21:59] self-existing amen
[22:02] now if we're going to believe that
[22:03] correctly then self-existing meaning
[22:05] existed alone right
[22:08] all right
[22:09] see then being that being self-existing
[22:14] he had thoughts
[22:17] those thoughts was his attributes then
[22:19] in and then we see him see he wanted to
[22:22] be a healer he wanted to be a savior he
[22:24] wanted to be a redeemer he wanted all of
[22:26] those things that was his desire
[22:29] all right
[22:30] we see him in manifestation now
[22:33] coming over on the other side into life
[22:35] all right but he never gained any
[22:37] attributes by coming into the world
[22:41] he had those attributes in him
[22:43] he just started displaying them
[22:46] all right
[22:47] and in doing that he had to bring forth
[22:51] as we read in genesis 1
[22:55] that he created man in his own image
[22:59] male and female created he
[23:02] him male and female created he them
[23:06] the bible doesn't have any problems
[23:08] talking like that
[23:10] we have problems trying to understand
[23:13] all right so we found that that man that
[23:16] he created
[23:18] that he made in his own image was not
[23:20] the genesis ii man
[23:22] that was made in the image image of
[23:24] animal
[23:25] but it was a spiritual being in his
[23:28] image then what is god
[23:31] you know
[23:33] man
[23:34] what is god then
[23:37] he
[23:38] he's real and see that he he created
[23:41] something real
[23:42] well we found out that that was not a
[23:45] creation like we talk
[23:47] we want to use the word creations or
[23:49] beginnings or startings or something
[23:52] no
[23:53] the bible calls them in revelation 3 14
[23:56] the beginning of the creation of god
[23:59] all right
[24:02] but see where did god have a beginning
[24:04] using both words beginning and creation
[24:06] in the same verse
[24:08] we think about it have it as something
[24:10] that's got to start
[24:13] why not think about it as when god is
[24:15] coming into view to our to our
[24:18] understanding
[24:19] to where we can comprehend him
[24:23] that he could start condescending
[24:25] downward that we would be able to
[24:28] see and understand
[24:30] all right
[24:33] are you following me then see then he
[24:35] made the man first in his
[24:37] spiritual image
[24:39] we found that was made
[24:41] before the foundation of the world
[24:45] the genesis 2 man
[24:48] is the flesh man
[24:50] right right
[24:51] but it was made after coming on over see
[24:56] that that man that was created back
[24:58] there then was a very um
[25:01] odd-looking
[25:02] product i guess you'd call it
[25:05] because he made that man male and female
[25:11] and we covered how that brother branham
[25:12] said that even after adam was
[25:15] you know in theophany in the garden to
[25:17] lead the animals as that 126 man
[25:22] that he was put in flesh
[25:25] but part of his being was left in
[25:27] theophany
[25:29] which was eve
[25:31] then
[25:35] see he could take the rib from adam
[25:38] because he was created in the spiritual
[25:41] part he was in adam and in the physical
[25:44] part eve was in adam
[25:46] all right
[25:47] see then eve being in adam and physical
[25:51] you could take a rib out
[25:53] and make a
[25:54] body and that's what he done
[25:57] but
[25:59] where did her soul and our being come
[26:01] from
[26:06] see then we went through it you know and
[26:08] and trying to not to spend so much time
[26:10] that to me that man that was made in
[26:12] genesis 1 26 and 27
[26:15] is the christ
[26:18] i tried to explain that that's the
[26:19] christ
[26:21] that's how come that it was made in the
[26:24] male and female part not
[26:26] not like a
[26:28] uh perverted idea we would have today as
[26:32] somebody come forth with products of men
[26:35] and products of women and we call it a
[26:37] male and a female
[26:39] they got a big old word in their fart we
[26:41] ain't supposed to be using too much but
[26:44] you know
[26:46] but see it's not that away
[26:50] he was in adam in spiritual
[26:53] creation
[26:55] all right
[26:56] then eve was in adam in the physical
[26:58] creation
[27:00] all right
[27:02] see her being her her
[27:04] her part to make to where it would be a
[27:07] another person was
[27:09] placed into that body
[27:13] all right
[27:15] i want to get to that this evening more
[27:16] where we talk about the fall
[27:19] because i wanted this questions and
[27:20] answered it out of the way
[27:22] to kind of see where you're standing or
[27:24] what your thoughts are
[27:26] and then we'll start into the fall this
[27:28] afternoon the lord willing to talk about
[27:31] it
[27:31] all right
[27:34] but you understand then man made in the
[27:37] image of god
[27:41] even in his fallen estate he's a little
[27:43] creator he's always working and doing
[27:46] things and building things different and
[27:49] the bible says the imagination of man's
[27:52] mind is continually evil
[27:54] right
[27:56] the things we make have always been
[27:58] something to kill us with
[28:00] they made guns killed a lot of people
[28:03] made cars kill more than the guns
[28:07] made planes kill more
[28:10] all right
[28:11] because see what we make is a perversion
[28:13] we take something put it together that's
[28:16] not a creation
[28:19] but see neither was even adam a creation
[28:22] in the spiritual part
[28:24] as to be
[28:25] something
[28:26] made
[28:30] you know
[28:33] it was the christ
[28:36] you can't explain it i went through it
[28:38] with you
[28:39] you can't take the the uh human
[28:43] life mankind
[28:46] and say that they're made male and
[28:48] female that'd be a perverted generation
[28:50] right
[28:52] so you can't use that for all mankind
[28:55] all mankind wasn't made male and female
[28:58] but this one that started was made that
[29:01] away why
[29:04] simple terminology
[29:06] when it finishes
[29:07] it'll finish with christ in the church
[29:09] right
[29:12] there's male and female
[29:15] when this finishes god's plan and what
[29:17] he had in his mind it'll wind up with
[29:19] being christ in the church
[29:22] which is male and female
[29:24] adam and eve were just the type of that
[29:25] to show
[29:26] what god was going to bring
[29:28] because she was in him spiritually and
[29:30] then she was in him physically
[29:33] all right
[29:34] and see that's in the image of god you
[29:36] say is god male and female
[29:39] we don't go into that doctrine they had
[29:41] in florida years ago about the the uh
[29:44] you know male
[29:45] female and male holy ghost i don't
[29:47] believe none of that
[29:50] because you got two people when you do
[29:51] that
[29:53] a lot of you don't even know that that
[29:54] was a doctrine but it was our
[29:57] and probably still is going
[29:59] with a lot of people
[30:00] they want to call it a male and female
[30:02] holy ghost i differed one brother about
[30:04] it i said brother you
[30:06] you'd be making god a messed up thing
[30:11] you'd make him male and female
[30:14] and you better not do that
[30:17] you're getting it over too far
[30:19] he's not male and female you say no no
[30:22] because see when jesus christ did on
[30:24] earth he was pure male.
[30:26] and you and i the prophet said was in
[30:28] him but now we wasn't physically in him
[30:32] come on
[30:35] so as god he was god he was male not a
[30:38] female male and female
[30:40] we
[30:43] as being his offspring
[30:46] is the part that brings forth the
[30:48] feminist
[30:49] part of it as the church
[30:53] but it can't be two holy ghosts that
[30:55] you'd mess it up it can only be christ
[30:59] made manifest
[31:01] in a church because christ is the only
[31:02] one you can talk about male and female
[31:06] did you follow that that was one of the
[31:08] life's messages christ is the only way
[31:10] you can talk about male female in one
[31:12] product
[31:15] you can't talk about it because that's
[31:17] what it said we wasn't even in jesus
[31:19] physically
[31:22] the only thing that we could be in jesus
[31:24] was
[31:25] the part of the eternal life that he had
[31:28] right
[31:30] all right see then it wouldn't work out
[31:33] because you can't do with that you can't
[31:35] take this and say well
[31:37] mankind has made male 1 no mankind is
[31:40] not made male and female
[31:44] adam was the only one made that away
[31:48] and we'll get to it this afternoon maybe
[31:50] as to what that is
[31:53] because if you mess it up in body you've
[31:55] messed it up you mess it up in seoul you
[31:57] messed up
[31:59] you better hold on to the right point
[32:01] all right
[32:02] but are you following me now
[32:04] see then the man was made in the image
[32:06] of god
[32:08] male and female
[32:10] all right
[32:12] then he was put in flesh
[32:16] male and female
[32:18] then the female was taken from the mail
[32:22] not that adam was standing there as a
[32:24] pervert male and female in that
[32:28] we'll get to it this evening maybe it'll
[32:29] clear it up some
[32:31] you better get away from that body
[32:33] trying to make it a male and female body
[32:39] he only took a part of that body
[32:44] he didn't saw him in hif and say well
[32:46] this is the man and this is the one
[32:49] not exactly he only took a rib to make
[32:53] to where adam could say this is now
[32:54] flesh of my flesh and bone of my bone
[32:56] that's true but you know eve was a
[32:58] separate
[32:59] identity
[33:01] physically because she was a human being
[33:04] all right
[33:06] but are you listening now get the point
[33:07] then we'll get to the questions and
[33:09] answers maybe i preach enough to make
[33:11] enough questions
[33:14] what do you think about
[33:17] adam and eve
[33:21] what do you think about them
[33:27] as how that they were my aide and what
[33:29] they were
[33:32] all right
[33:33] maybe that'll bring up some questions
[33:35] from some of you
[33:36] but the main thing is to
[33:38] get back to the genesis 1 26 man
[33:42] where brother branham said that was the
[33:43] theophany man
[33:47] all right
[33:48] was that man real
[33:51] or was it just a spirit
[33:55] see i'm trying to get you to realize
[33:57] what you are
[34:00] and you know what i can blow you apart
[34:02] i can destroy the body
[34:06] the spirit would have to leave that as
[34:08] the scripture would say and go back to
[34:10] god who gave it
[34:12] all right
[34:13] it's all right
[34:15] not go back at some sinful point
[34:18] he can't take it back that way
[34:20] but the soul lives on
[34:24] mankind can't destroy your soul
[34:27] the bible plainly tells you that don't
[34:29] fear him that can destroy the body but
[34:31] says fear him that can destroy the soul
[34:34] all right see the soul is the real you
[34:40] right
[34:42] the soul is the real you that's what you
[34:44] are because soul means being person
[34:51] and that's what you are you're a person
[34:53] yes
[34:53] all right
[34:56] we'll get to where you get your
[34:57] identities later maybe
[34:59] in the spirit realm of where you start
[35:01] this
[35:03] and define a lot of things
[35:06] i'm just wanting to get the point
[35:09] if god is real
[35:14] then your soul is real
[35:18] and your soul would be the point that
[35:19] would be made in the image of god
[35:22] your body's made in the image of animal
[35:26] your spirit is just a mediator between
[35:28] the two
[35:30] you know a workable part to make it work
[35:34] makes your body work
[35:35] all right
[35:38] but are you understanding the series
[35:41] that i'm trying to bring
[35:42] is to try to get us to see how real god
[35:45] is
[35:46] and then by doing that to see if man is
[35:49] made in the image
[35:51] he's not made in another likeness
[35:53] somewhere
[35:54] i tried to explain that we talk about
[35:56] image or likeness
[36:00] that man in genesis 1 26 and 27 would
[36:03] have to be the spirit man the christ
[36:06] but then he was put in flesh
[36:10] in 2 7.
[36:12] all right now that's the only time that
[36:14] could happen
[36:17] now when you come with christ
[36:20] you know jesus when he came
[36:23] he wasn't male and female
[36:28] in a perverted way of thinking about it
[36:32] and the prophet would say we were in
[36:34] christ
[36:36] as he walked the shores of god but what
[36:38] part of us was there
[36:41] the only eternal life the only thing
[36:43] could be the eternal life that you have
[36:46] all right
[36:47] see then he can come back to make it
[36:49] christ in the church
[36:52] true
[36:54] all right now we're back to what he
[36:57] meant for to be
[37:02] let me cover this part and then you get
[37:03] ready for the question see
[37:05] god wanted to be able to
[37:09] or to bring mankind into
[37:12] being
[37:15] you remember the last one we read and i
[37:17] said don't get tied up in your thinking
[37:19] so much see we say god made angels and
[37:21] they worshiped him that made him god
[37:23] that was not the worship he wanted
[37:26] you remember the last quotes there the
[37:28] other day
[37:29] what was it he made man
[37:32] he wants to worship from his offspring
[37:37] angels is wonderful they're flying
[37:39] around him all day long screaming and
[37:41] hollering
[37:42] right
[37:43] singing wonderful i'm telling it right
[37:48] but his ear is not tuned to them
[37:52] his ear is tuned to your voice
[37:57] he'd rather have the worshiped
[38:00] in our worst form i guess you would call
[38:02] it from his children
[38:05] than the worship of all of those angels
[38:11] because we're his offspring amen
[38:14] you know
[38:18] your true offspring is a wonderful thing
[38:20] right yes
[38:24] and then you say well i love the
[38:25] neighbors kids and i don't know but
[38:27] they're not like your offspring
[38:30] if there is there's something messed up
[38:31] in your thinking
[38:33] it's supposed to be your offspring first
[38:35] and then you can love everybody else
[38:37] and i understand those things but you're
[38:39] following me now
[38:42] god's original plan
[38:46] was to have his offspring
[38:51] that's the perfect will of god
[38:54] for not for sin
[38:58] you can't make the perfect will of god
[39:00] being that he won't he was going to
[39:03] bring sin into being i'll try to cover
[39:05] that this afternoon more
[39:07] sin came into being as a permissive will
[39:11] sin is not a perfect wheel
[39:18] see he wanted us to come right to begin
[39:20] with
[39:22] we were the ones that failed
[39:25] you remember where i gave it off the
[39:26] spoken words original seed darling last
[39:28] sunday where we were talking about it
[39:32] or wednesday
[39:33] where brother random said being born by
[39:35] the word and spirit brings you back
[39:38] like you should have been in the
[39:40] beginning
[39:42] you just think what a beautiful thing it
[39:44] would have been
[39:45] for
[39:47] sin to not been in the picture
[39:50] right
[39:51] and we would have come without sin of
[39:53] course everybody wouldn't come you know
[39:56] all these human beings wouldn't have
[39:57] come
[39:59] it would have only been the offspring of
[40:01] god
[40:03] right it wouldn't have been no foolish
[40:04] virgins
[40:06] there wouldn't have been a sealed jew to
[40:08] be given eternal life
[40:10] there wouldn't have been nothing like
[40:11] that
[40:13] it would have just been his offspring
[40:17] all right
[40:19] and then by bringing it that away though
[40:22] you say well why didn't he keep it that
[40:24] way because he had those attributes in
[40:26] him
[40:28] amen there's no way he could be a savior
[40:31] couldn't be a healer
[40:32] he couldn't be a father the way he
[40:33] wanted to
[40:36] be mean not like the real the way he
[40:39] wanted he could be a father by creation
[40:43] but remember he created the angels that
[40:45] didn't make him father
[40:48] right
[40:49] that made him just god to say a object
[40:51] of worship
[40:52] all right
[40:54] he had many of those attributes in him
[40:56] that could never have been displayed
[40:59] so we don't glory in the fall
[41:03] no let's don't go that far well look at
[41:06] it then god's not too mad at me because
[41:08] he wanted it to be like this
[41:10] no he didn't want it to be like this
[41:14] he knew it would be like this there's a
[41:17] whole lot of difference in wanting it to
[41:19] be and knowing what it'll be
[41:24] so he had to allow man to come into a
[41:27] sinful condition
[41:29] not make us sinful
[41:32] you realize if he made you sinful
[41:34] he cannot judge you for being sinful
[41:39] that ought to be a sensible statement
[41:42] if he made you wrong he can't judge you
[41:45] for being wrong because he made you that
[41:47] way
[41:49] but he didn't make us wrong
[41:53] he made us right
[41:55] we were the ones that went wrong
[41:58] we'll cover more this evening on that
[41:59] but i'm just getting the point just to
[42:01] thought
[42:03] do you believe god is real
[42:08] do you believe that you're real
[42:12] do you know that if they wouldn't but
[42:13] one person in the world
[42:15] jesus christ would have still died to
[42:16] give that person eternal life
[42:20] you realize that
[42:23] but look what he's getting by
[42:26] the fallen condition
[42:32] there's going to be a lot of people in
[42:34] heaven because of the
[42:37] bride that fail
[42:41] as i said we don't glory in the fall
[42:44] with glory in the savior
[42:48] he didn't plan this to be
[42:51] let me get that part before we go
[42:55] he didn't plan this to be
[43:00] he just knew if he made us the way it
[43:02] would be
[43:03] is that hard to understand
[43:06] he didn't make it to be wrong
[43:10] that's where people mess up you know i
[43:12] see it
[43:13] so much of the people the message it's
[43:15] hardest for me to stay away from it even
[43:17] here that i want to get into this
[43:19] afternoon people think that eve was made
[43:21] some kind of a by-product that made her
[43:24] a sex
[43:25] sexual product of a fact of all she was
[43:28] just
[43:30] you know lustful product
[43:34] well if god made her that way
[43:37] he can't judge her
[43:41] right
[43:44] if he made you girls wrong your sisters
[43:46] if he made you wrong he can't judge you
[43:48] for being wrong so we know better than
[43:50] that
[43:53] she was made perfect and right
[43:57] right
[43:59] wasn't anything wrong with the body
[44:01] that's what
[44:02] women are sold by products
[44:05] you don't even know what the word
[44:06] byproduct means look it up in the
[44:09] dictionary
[44:14] it means simply an a model
[44:17] compared to a town hall town
[44:20] house i really call it cart and what big
[44:22] forward
[44:29] it means something of
[44:31] greater value
[44:33] or equal value
[44:35] or greater value
[44:37] if you've looked up the word byproduct
[44:40] but see we've got it all that we want to
[44:42] beat the women to death because of them
[44:44] being what they are
[44:47] we'll get to it this afternoon maybe
[44:49] it'll clear up a lot of things
[44:51] there wasn't anything wrong with ev's
[44:53] body
[44:57] there wasn't nothing wrong with their
[44:58] soul
[45:04] yeah
[45:06] we'll get out to think on some things
[45:10] but the main thing i want you to see is
[45:12] how real
[45:14] god is
[45:15] and then see how real you are
[45:23] and to think about that
[45:26] man made in the image of god
[45:29] doesn't mean some likeness to look like
[45:31] god or something
[45:34] that means god in another form
[45:41] that product he made in the garden was
[45:43] christ
[45:46] it's going to finish his christ
[45:51] because that's christ in the church
[45:53] because adam and eve started it
[45:56] what about it what do you think about it
[45:59] which one of these is the most alive
[46:05] i see a purple and an orange
[46:08] who's got the blue over here
[46:17] all right
[46:18] who'll be first on the questions and
[46:20] answers
[46:26] surely by all of this
[46:28] 16 sermons somebody ought to have a
[46:30] question
[46:32] sister trudy
[46:35] all right now remember microphone next
[46:37] to mouth
[46:39] where everybody can hear okay
[46:42] um
[46:44] i have a lot
[46:46] but i'll try to keep it simple
[46:48] last sunday when i left you i left here
[46:50] really confused
[46:53] because of the things that you brought
[46:55] out in genesis 1 26 127.
[46:59] now
[47:00] little by little
[47:02] it has been revealed though i understand
[47:04] little by little i haven't got the whole
[47:06] picture yet but slowly we going
[47:09] okay so my first question was
[47:13] um 1 john 6 1 26 27
[47:16] when you said making male female
[47:20] you said that was a special man that was
[47:22] a different man now that is the same man
[47:25] that was put into the flesh adam in
[47:27] genesis 2.
[47:29] okay
[47:30] now
[47:31] on
[47:33] question and answers on hebrews chapter
[47:35] 3
[47:36] where brother branham said um
[47:38] one put in flesh and one was still in
[47:40] theophany
[47:42] that's right
[47:43] the female part which was
[47:46] eve that was still antiophany right
[47:49] now
[47:50] i had a bad thought of what that meant
[47:54] because you said before that adam and
[47:55] eve shared the same theophany yeah
[47:58] it was hard to understand
[48:01] i'm starting to think of conjoined twins
[48:03] theophany something like that but
[48:06] i know it wasn't true but my mind was
[48:09] just trying to process it itself
[48:11] now
[48:13] is this when
[48:14] it's separated because when i came into
[48:17] existence and you came into existence
[48:19] your theophany wasn't joined with sister
[48:21] peggy's right so is that the time when
[48:24] he took eve theophany out or when eve
[48:27] came out of adam was that the time when
[48:29] it was separated for mankind
[48:32] well
[48:33] let me make sure you follow the point
[48:36] all right
[48:38] and uh see that brother branham's when
[48:39] it said it you know part
[48:41] eve was still in theophany
[48:44] adam had done been put in the flesh
[48:47] said adam was lonely
[48:49] that's the quotes you know said because
[48:51] part of his being
[48:53] was not there
[48:55] all right now we're not talking about to
[48:57] the strangers that are among us we're
[49:00] not talking about trying to figure out
[49:03] soul matings and different things
[49:05] because that's contrary that's garbage
[49:07] cans
[49:09] even adam when they were put into flesh
[49:12] is when you talk about them coming to be
[49:15] in a soul basis
[49:19] you know because it would be coming down
[49:22] to that point see all right see then
[49:24] once
[49:25] that 126 man
[49:29] is the christ
[49:31] all right just not adam and eve
[49:33] okay
[49:34] all right you remember i went over the
[49:36] 126 man
[49:38] in 26 27 is not just adam and eve
[49:41] it's the christ
[49:43] the theophany
[49:45] of god
[49:47] eternal life because once that was put
[49:49] into adam
[49:51] then his soul was eternal all right
[49:54] now you're not talking about there as
[49:56] trying to figure out how many souls what
[49:58] everything is
[49:59] and there's no way that that peggy and i
[50:02] are the same soul
[50:04] if she has eternal life today and i
[50:07] don't have it
[50:10] that's not talking about our soul part
[50:13] of human beings
[50:15] it's talking about eternal life
[50:18] that was eternal life the 126 and 27 man
[50:21] was eternal life
[50:23] the christ
[50:25] all right
[50:27] not just something set aside it was the
[50:29] eternal life that would ever be
[50:32] into all of us
[50:34] so that way there's only one
[50:36] one
[50:37] no
[50:38] get the other hand out of the way but
[50:40] only one eternal life
[50:44] there's only one
[50:45] theophany that's eternal
[50:48] now all people have a theophany in the
[50:50] basis of a place to go to
[50:53] once you die because that's
[50:55] but it's not eternal
[50:57] it's not the one in cl in corinthians it
[50:59] says that we have one eternal in the
[51:02] heavens
[51:04] the one eternal in the heavens is not
[51:06] talking about mankind the earth
[51:08] theophany cures them down
[51:11] theophany simply can be used as a body
[51:14] of a deity
[51:15] or a form or whatever you are so sinners
[51:18] have theophany see because they got a
[51:21] place to live
[51:22] and that's their soul
[51:25] that they're you know in a place of hold
[51:28] and things whereas those that have died
[51:30] in christ
[51:32] have a place to live to go on into the
[51:34] presence of almighty god or go as and
[51:37] you know use that presence lightly go
[51:39] into the souls under the altar where
[51:42] brother branham saw the ones you know
[51:44] and he saw people
[51:47] not just the spirit or something
[51:48] floating around he could feel him he
[51:50] could hear him he could talk to him all
[51:52] right
[51:53] but see then to me when you say when
[51:56] brother branham is saying that adam was
[51:58] put in the theophany of adam in other
[52:01] words was put into flesh
[52:03] but said part of him was still missing
[52:05] which was eve
[52:07] in the theophany
[52:09] all right because he said that theophany
[52:11] was not there
[52:13] well see then when she was put into
[52:14] flesh
[52:17] then you can bring that theophany of her
[52:19] and put it in the flesh
[52:20] and they both had eternal life
[52:23] all right that's on blasphemous names
[52:25] because a lot of people don't know that
[52:27] one but read blasphemius 9 where brother
[52:30] ryan said especially into adam he
[52:32] breathed the breath of eternal life and
[52:34] said he became an eternal person with
[52:36] god well adam and eve would have been
[52:38] that form
[52:40] see so that theophany when you're
[52:42] thinking about theophany
[52:45] think about it as
[52:47] the same way you think about god
[52:50] he's one
[52:53] there's only one eternal theophany
[52:58] right so you can say well i've got a
[53:01] theophany up in heaven that's what 99
[53:03] percent of the people of the mainstream
[53:05] i know of thinks about it
[53:08] that it's somewhere up yonder
[53:11] well
[53:13] we haven't got into that covering the
[53:14] scriptural part because it says if this
[53:17] earthly tabernacle be dissolved or were
[53:20] dissolved
[53:22] it's there the minute you die it's not
[53:23] there something up there that's just
[53:25] standing there waiting on you to get up
[53:27] there
[53:29] neither is the headstone here as
[53:31] something floating around up in the sky
[53:34] that's trying to wait for you to get to
[53:36] it
[53:37] it's terminologies it's thoughts
[53:40] see so part of of adam was still in
[53:42] theophany which would have been eve
[53:46] you know
[53:47] it's just simply stating that the body
[53:49] of adam then when he come forth
[53:52] had it been put all of the theophany
[53:55] into adam
[53:57] where would eve come from
[54:02] where would her eternal life have come
[54:04] from
[54:06] couldn't come from adam
[54:09] all right so part was left in theophany
[54:12] part put in flesh
[54:15] when it's put in flesh is genesis 2
[54:17] right
[54:18] all right see then when the part that
[54:20] eve was to be the flesh removed from
[54:23] adam the rib you know and made a flesh
[54:26] then
[54:29] that part that was missing
[54:31] as we'd call it or wasn't there was put
[54:34] in the eve
[54:36] and it made eve eternal
[54:39] right now not in body
[54:42] not in spirit
[54:44] you're only dealing with a soul that's
[54:45] why brother brown says on the old book
[54:47] it's called
[54:48] um
[54:50] hebrews it's uh page 80 of the hebrew
[54:53] book i believe that's right
[54:55] where he says your soul is your
[54:57] theophany
[54:59] well that's what it is
[55:01] it's the body you go to
[55:04] all right i explained that a minute ago
[55:05] hope it's still with you a sinner he has
[55:08] to go to a place
[55:10] right
[55:11] if he dies he goes somewhere what goes
[55:14] there not his body not his spirit his
[55:16] soul
[55:17] goes to a place to wait all right so if
[55:21] a christian dies
[55:22] he goes somewhere
[55:24] you can call both of them theophany just
[55:26] remember
[55:27] that you're using it loosely because
[55:29] brother random does use the word
[55:31] theophany for a sinner
[55:33] all right but just make sure you don't
[55:36] use that comparison to
[55:38] eternal in the heavens
[55:40] because you can't have a sinner with
[55:41] that
[55:42] all right
[55:44] and see then
[55:45] if if you follow what i'm saying then
[55:47] what's that 126 and 27 that man the
[55:50] bible says was made male and female
[55:55] male and female created he him hell
[55:57] female create he them
[56:00] that wasn't a two-part man as we call
[56:03] too far
[56:04] that was the part that was to be put
[56:05] into adam the part that was to be put
[56:08] into eve
[56:09] and i believe being one eternal
[56:11] theophany
[56:13] that that was your creation as well as
[56:15] adam's creation
[56:18] if you have eternal life today that was
[56:21] your creation
[56:23] as well as adam's creation because it
[56:25] wasn't a creation it was starting
[56:27] something
[56:30] genesis 1 26
[56:33] is a
[56:35] eternal life
[56:39] right
[56:41] when it was put into flesh then you had
[56:43] adam with eternal life
[56:46] when you receive cause we lost it that's
[56:48] where the fall is at
[56:50] see the fall will cover this evening it
[56:52] stopped the process
[56:54] had it not stopped that process look
[56:55] what god would have done
[56:59] you understand had the process not
[57:01] stopped
[57:02] then where would you and i come in that
[57:10] here come on if you're following me you
[57:11] would only have adam and eve there have
[57:13] been no more people
[57:17] because see that 126 man was you
[57:20] that's got eternal life
[57:22] not you physically and not your soul
[57:26] we'll get to that later it's not your
[57:28] soul your soul is your theophany yes
[57:32] but if you're born again
[57:35] the nature of your soul is god if not
[57:37] it's of the world
[57:39] all right
[57:40] you know are you following the point now
[57:42] yes i yes
[57:44] um my next question well what i think
[57:47] you answered it was that
[57:50] the term that was used to say adam and
[57:52] eve had the same theophany it was
[57:55] christ
[57:57] and that's the same thing with us
[57:58] exactly we have the same theophany which
[58:00] was christ which is the only one right
[58:03] okay
[58:05] see because when you receive eternal
[58:06] life
[58:08] if you followed what i just said see if
[58:10] you only had that that back there was
[58:12] just adam and eve
[58:15] are you with me if if that was just adam
[58:17] and eve
[58:19] you know in the 126-27 man then that's
[58:22] all you've ever had in the world
[58:27] no that was eternal life that was the
[58:29] same thing i spent so much time trying
[58:31] to say god came himself he never sent a
[58:34] son
[58:36] so when he started this creation of
[58:38] mankind
[58:39] it starts with christ
[58:43] so that man in 126 and 27
[58:46] sister gail was you in eternal life
[58:49] not your body not your spirit not your
[58:51] soul
[58:54] it's the eternal life that come into
[58:56] your soul
[58:58] because see adam and eve had to be body
[59:01] spirit and soul
[59:03] then eternal life came into him
[59:06] all right
[59:08] see i tried i made an emphasis out of it
[59:10] i said don't make it to where that you
[59:12] say adam was body and spirit and then
[59:15] put to just put the soul of god down in
[59:17] there then you wouldn't you'd have
[59:19] christ
[59:26] he had to be adam had to be body spirit
[59:28] and soul a man
[59:30] then god gave him eternal life
[59:33] that's exactly what we are
[59:36] when you receive for that new birth
[59:40] that means your eternity caught up with
[59:42] you
[59:43] brother around said you heard from your
[59:45] theophany
[59:46] i know what the biggest portion of the
[59:48] people of this message believe about
[59:49] theophany
[59:52] they write songs about them they do all
[59:54] kind of things and i'm not going off on
[59:56] nobody
[59:59] but if you got one up yonder
[1:00:03] how are you going to get to it
[1:00:09] and all of those beyond the curtain of
[1:00:11] time
[1:00:14] were in their theophany
[1:00:16] and they were eternal
[1:00:22] i know years ago they were arguing about
[1:00:24] that that nobody had the eternal life
[1:00:26] like that and i said well
[1:00:29] brother brown said there was a
[1:00:31] 90 or 80 or 90 year old woman there that
[1:00:34] had eternal life
[1:00:36] you know she got it here
[1:00:38] and i'll i'll find it one of these days
[1:00:39] because i know it's dire but i'll quote
[1:00:41] it as my home
[1:00:44] that he said his first girlfriend was
[1:00:46] there
[1:00:48] i'll find that in this event it's a
[1:00:49] little off phrase somewhere and i can't
[1:00:51] find it even to the computer
[1:00:53] but
[1:00:56] the point is there was a lot of people
[1:00:58] there
[1:01:02] and you better remember that
[1:01:05] which one was it hope
[1:01:08] hope was there
[1:01:11] so she must have had eternal life here
[1:01:14] to get there
[1:01:18] and see i know this is strange to 90 of
[1:01:20] the people i know it is even strange
[1:01:22] here to some of you for me to talk
[1:01:25] about
[1:01:26] the soul and the things
[1:01:28] but i think it's time to rub out a
[1:01:30] little bit of our play pretties and
[1:01:32] get away from our little silly ideas
[1:01:34] about things
[1:01:36] get down to in some truth
[1:01:40] well i i always was eternal if you'll
[1:01:44] deal with me and let me and you talk on
[1:01:45] 126 and 27 that man in 126 and 27 always
[1:01:50] was eternal
[1:01:53] because he's in the image of god
[1:01:55] because he is god
[1:02:00] it's not the creation of mankind as
[1:02:02] physical beings
[1:02:04] that's the creation of christ
[1:02:09] you get any more no no i'm good you
[1:02:11] answered all the questions
[1:02:12] okay
[1:02:14] maybe somebody else who'll be next
[1:02:17] sister trudy
[1:02:25] this conversation brought up a question
[1:02:28] are you saying that because
[1:02:31] adam received eternal life eve had it
[1:02:34] when she was put into flesh
[1:02:37] how did she get eternal life okay how
[1:02:40] did he get eternal okay now there is and
[1:02:43] i said i don't mind making statements i
[1:02:45] may complain
[1:02:47] there is no quotes that i can find about
[1:02:50] eve getting eternal life when she come
[1:02:52] into the world
[1:02:55] now i'd like to have that
[1:02:58] because i've preached it for 40 years as
[1:03:00] being that she did receive
[1:03:02] eternal life
[1:03:04] in the garden the same as adam
[1:03:07] but i've preached that as a man and i've
[1:03:09] always said that's my thoughts because
[1:03:11] you can i can prove blasphemous names
[1:03:14] that brother randall says god breathed
[1:03:17] into adam's nostrils
[1:03:20] and he became an eternal person i have
[1:03:22] no argument you can't argue that one
[1:03:25] you can argue the point about eve
[1:03:28] and i would wondering why in the world
[1:03:30] some false doctrine hadn't got started
[1:03:32] on that
[1:03:34] i do i wonder
[1:03:36] i've always said a true preacher can
[1:03:38] preach false doctrine better than the
[1:03:40] false guys can do it and i don't mean
[1:03:42] that brag and i just mean it a god's
[1:03:43] honest truth
[1:03:45] if i didn't believe eve had eternal life
[1:03:49] and if i'd the only way i can do it i
[1:03:51] can't bring christ in the church
[1:03:52] together
[1:03:54] we'll bring an atom with eternal life
[1:03:56] and neve not with eternal life
[1:03:59] you can't put christ in the church
[1:04:00] together
[1:04:01] you can't have a type
[1:04:04] that's what holds me
[1:04:06] but if i was gonna preach false doctrine
[1:04:08] you know what i'd preach i'd really
[1:04:09] preach eve as a
[1:04:12] byproduct
[1:04:16] and i'd say the reason eve could fall
[1:04:18] was
[1:04:19] she wasn't eternal in soul
[1:04:22] she was just a plain old sinner made
[1:04:24] that away
[1:04:27] and then i'd make god her author and i'd
[1:04:29] be in bad shape
[1:04:31] so
[1:04:32] i don't believe it
[1:04:35] i believe even adam and theophany
[1:04:38] were one souls
[1:04:42] use that word soul in theophany close
[1:04:46] but they were not the same soul because
[1:04:48] eve was her own identity
[1:04:51] when she come into the world
[1:04:55] right
[1:04:56] me and my wife are not
[1:04:58] soul mated
[1:05:02] that's not the way you want to go it
[1:05:05] is she has eternal life i have eternal
[1:05:07] life that way we have the same eternal
[1:05:10] life and there's only one eternal life
[1:05:14] so then there's only one eternal
[1:05:16] theophany
[1:05:19] but i've always been taught it was up in
[1:05:21] heaven
[1:05:22] i know it
[1:05:23] give you the quotes from brother branham
[1:05:29] but we've also been taught that the
[1:05:30] headstone
[1:05:33] came 2000 years ago
[1:05:38] in jesus christ and that's true
[1:05:42] but it didn't come on the church because
[1:05:44] he said he was rejected
[1:05:47] and would not come until the evening
[1:05:49] time
[1:05:51] so i know
[1:05:52] my wife we talk a lot
[1:05:55] i know that i'm laying out some things
[1:05:57] that some of you have never considered
[1:05:59] or never thought about in a lot of ways
[1:06:02] but like i said folks it's time to quit
[1:06:04] playing sugar tits
[1:06:06] i've tried for almost 50 years of
[1:06:09] preaching this
[1:06:11] it's not bragging it's god's honest
[1:06:13] truth i got the tapes to prove it that's
[1:06:15] not something you're exalting yourself
[1:06:17] no i exalt jesus christ
[1:06:23] because they've been anybody that's kept
[1:06:25] this man straight it had to be him
[1:06:27] this man would love to go off on a lot
[1:06:29] of other things you think it ain't right
[1:06:31] you would too
[1:06:33] don't garbage can with me and i won't
[1:06:35] were you
[1:06:37] we talk plain and honest and i'm sorry
[1:06:41] see there cannot be but one eternal god
[1:06:45] they cannot be but one eternal soul
[1:06:53] because
[1:06:54] if 10 million people are born again
[1:06:57] that's one soul
[1:06:59] that's one theophany
[1:07:01] that's one christ
[1:07:04] there's one eternal life
[1:07:07] we all have the same eternal life that's
[1:07:09] why we're brothers and sisters
[1:07:12] in christ
[1:07:16] what a difference in flesh isn't things
[1:07:22] you know what is that
[1:07:24] that what you're talking about
[1:07:25] see then eve you still got to frown on
[1:07:28] the face so yeah all right when did he
[1:07:30] get saved
[1:07:32] when did eve receive receive eternal
[1:07:34] life all right
[1:07:36] when she was taken from adam
[1:07:40] and made into flesh
[1:07:43] then
[1:07:45] is it not correct that as he breathed
[1:07:47] into adam
[1:07:48] the nostrils
[1:07:51] and he become an eternal person at least
[1:07:53] you'd have to admit that when he was
[1:07:55] placed over god would have to breathe
[1:07:57] into her nostrils
[1:07:59] for her to have
[1:08:00] life
[1:08:01] because any of these babies anybody
[1:08:03] sitting here in front of me anybody
[1:08:04] listening the day you was born god
[1:08:07] breathed into your nostrils
[1:08:10] not satan
[1:08:12] he can't give you that
[1:08:16] he can't create
[1:08:18] he can't give your soul he perverts the
[1:08:19] nature of your soul into what
[1:08:22] you are
[1:08:23] so then when eve was removed from adam
[1:08:26] physically
[1:08:27] now what are you going to do
[1:08:30] it's like adam i can take it and prove
[1:08:32] it to you then we have because the
[1:08:35] prophet's saying it
[1:08:37] this genesis 1 26 man was put into 2 7.
[1:08:42] he said and he breathed into the
[1:08:43] nostrils of adam and he became
[1:08:46] an eternal person
[1:08:50] see then
[1:08:51] you're going to have to get with me this
[1:08:52] afternoon like because you're going to
[1:08:54] say well
[1:08:55] can you fall from eternal life you
[1:08:58] cannot fall from eternal life
[1:09:04] we'll get that before we ever start you
[1:09:06] can't fall from eternal life that'd make
[1:09:08] god an ending giver
[1:09:10] but see adam put in the flesh
[1:09:12] and god brings that life that part of
[1:09:15] him
[1:09:16] into adam as eternal life to me when eve
[1:09:20] was put in flesh
[1:09:22] god simply breathed into her nostrils
[1:09:24] the part and placed into her
[1:09:27] that part that theophany part that she
[1:09:30] was
[1:09:31] which is eternal life
[1:09:35] see that was creation
[1:09:39] but then you and i have to come by new
[1:09:41] birth
[1:09:42] to receive eternal life
[1:09:46] and you know that really the bible says
[1:09:48] that the woman that liveth in pleasure
[1:09:50] is what
[1:09:52] dead while she liveth
[1:09:55] you know really you're not a living
[1:09:56] being with a donnie until you're born
[1:09:58] again
[1:10:00] you're a human
[1:10:02] just a little higher than the dog
[1:10:06] or the monkey anyway
[1:10:08] just a little higher
[1:10:13] yeah you're a human being your soul your
[1:10:15] person right
[1:10:17] marvelous
[1:10:20] but when he breathes into your nostrils
[1:10:22] the breath of eternal life by the new
[1:10:24] birth
[1:10:25] you then become an eternal person with
[1:10:27] god
[1:10:28] like adam was
[1:10:31] in the garden
[1:10:34] the only difference is the adoptions and
[1:10:36] the things that you've got to go through
[1:10:39] so eve received eternal life
[1:10:42] by god breathing into her nostrils
[1:10:46] but then once you bring sin you got to
[1:10:48] cut it off now
[1:10:50] you just look at the fact if there
[1:10:52] hadn't been no sin look what happened
[1:10:56] let's get it look what will happen
[1:11:04] do you realize now we're not going to
[1:11:06] get into a long process to prove a point
[1:11:08] but talk about it
[1:11:10] what if sin had not entered the picture
[1:11:15] i said it while ago and at least he was
[1:11:17] amen and some agreeing about it anyway
[1:11:19] you said it would have been only his
[1:11:21] offspring it would have come into
[1:11:22] existence all right how are you going to
[1:11:24] get them here
[1:11:27] and we're not going to get into
[1:11:28] perverted ideas
[1:11:32] but you know that adam could not have
[1:11:34] gotten us here
[1:11:42] that's why sisters come on i've fought
[1:11:43] this thing out for 50 years i'm not no
[1:11:45] feminist
[1:11:46] or what you call them ago words you know
[1:11:49] oh you're this there you know
[1:11:52] but i've defended the gospel
[1:11:55] for 50 years
[1:11:58] your women are not no different than us
[1:11:59] men are
[1:12:04] you need the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:12:06] and we need it too
[1:12:10] no matter who you are
[1:12:13] what you think about it what would have
[1:12:14] happened had we not fallen
[1:12:20] you realize that eve
[1:12:22] adam could have nudged eve and said eve
[1:12:24] it's time to speak
[1:12:28] he needed eve for the speaking
[1:12:32] come on 40 years so you want to argue
[1:12:34] with me just keep on hurricane
[1:12:37] eve
[1:12:38] would have spoke the word
[1:12:43] and a baby would have come
[1:12:48] not
[1:12:49] newborn
[1:12:52] a child would have been standing there
[1:12:56] wouldn't there had to be no baby to grow
[1:12:58] up and be old
[1:12:59] he would have simply spoke
[1:13:02] let's sprang down the line he would
[1:13:04] simply spoke saith
[1:13:06] that's right
[1:13:08] abel let's put it back up
[1:13:10] evil said abel come forth
[1:13:14] now if you think i'm wrong let's get in
[1:13:16] some bible
[1:13:18] because according to my understanding
[1:13:21] of reading the scriptures
[1:13:24] that there was a tree in the garden
[1:13:30] we know there was two trees right we
[1:13:32] know that okay but there was a tree
[1:13:34] there of the tree of life
[1:13:36] in the garden right
[1:13:38] do you realize that
[1:13:40] it's a beautiful story
[1:13:43] that eve would have said abel come forth
[1:13:45] and there he stood
[1:13:47] but you know what he would have been
[1:13:49] even though god gave him and breathed
[1:13:51] into his nostrils
[1:13:53] eternal life
[1:13:56] he would have still been mortal in his
[1:13:58] body because adam and eve were still
[1:14:00] mortal
[1:14:01] in their body you know doomed to death
[1:14:04] which wouldn't have been no death
[1:14:07] do you know what
[1:14:08] abel would have had to done
[1:14:11] abel would have had to walk over to the
[1:14:13] tree of life
[1:14:17] and taken a leaf off the tree or a beat
[1:14:19] by the fruit and his body would have
[1:14:21] been made eternal
[1:14:24] because that was what would happen to
[1:14:25] adam and eve
[1:14:28] they would partook of the tree of life
[1:14:30] and their body would have been made
[1:14:31] eternal that's where they needed
[1:14:32] eternity from
[1:14:34] right
[1:14:37] seth came next
[1:14:39] noah
[1:14:40] bring it all the way down
[1:14:42] but you see that was not the plan and
[1:14:44] purpose because you'd have trouble
[1:14:46] because you'd run into christ one day
[1:14:48] that he would need to come forth and he
[1:14:50] didn't do it so we did that's beside the
[1:14:52] point
[1:14:53] we didn't come that away
[1:14:55] ends the story right it just shows a
[1:14:57] beautiful picture because really listen
[1:15:00] the reason i believe it that way
[1:15:06] brother louise
[1:15:07] you're born body spirit and soul lost
[1:15:10] amen
[1:15:13] now you may believe something mother but
[1:15:15] i might need to move over to somebody
[1:15:17] else because he's been back in some
[1:15:18] backgrounds
[1:15:20] and i don't think he does but
[1:15:22] i use my hollywood okay
[1:15:25] okay
[1:15:26] now brother colley
[1:15:28] your body spirit and soul
[1:15:31] but you need eternal life
[1:15:32] amen
[1:15:34] you know what
[1:15:36] god gave you eternal life by the new
[1:15:37] birth
[1:15:39] it makes your soul eternal
[1:15:41] that don't make your spirit eternal that
[1:15:42] don't make your body eternal
[1:15:49] but as long as you eat of this
[1:15:52] which is the tree of life the word of
[1:15:54] god the bible
[1:15:56] one day your body will be made eternal
[1:15:59] some way
[1:16:00] we may ought to die and go by the ground
[1:16:02] except maybe one person but somebody's
[1:16:04] still going to stand there and be
[1:16:06] changed and that'll take care of it all
[1:16:07] right
[1:16:08] eternal life
[1:16:10] so we're coming the same way we would
[1:16:12] have come except sin entered the picture
[1:16:16] right
[1:16:17] we're to come to the tree of life which
[1:16:19] is the word of god this message is the
[1:16:21] tree of life
[1:16:22] which is the word of god
[1:16:26] and we're eating of that tree
[1:16:32] see then there's no problems with the
[1:16:34] the fall is not a bad thing
[1:16:38] right as i said it just helps him to
[1:16:41] manifest his attributes
[1:16:44] because if it's going to come that way
[1:16:46] he's going to be savior healer delivered
[1:16:49] he's going to come that way
[1:16:51] but the ultimate end is one thing
[1:16:55] had there been no sin there would have
[1:16:57] been
[1:16:58] one way
[1:16:59] but with sin the ultimate end is the
[1:17:02] same
[1:17:06] is the bride of jesus christ
[1:17:09] with eternal life
[1:17:12] but then just think about it
[1:17:15] you know that there's eight times more
[1:17:17] if you type in it foolish virgins than
[1:17:19] our genuine bride if you top no one
[1:17:22] right in enoch
[1:17:25] well you know those people
[1:17:28] can be given eternal life
[1:17:33] but they'll never be the bride
[1:17:37] that's why they'll always be somebody
[1:17:39] for you to talk to
[1:17:40] about christ
[1:17:43] that answer your question or talk long
[1:17:44] enough
[1:17:46] i have another one all right go ahead
[1:17:48] when brother branham said in the
[1:17:50] beginning before the eternal
[1:17:53] could this mean that before the word
[1:17:55] came forth because the word is eternal
[1:18:02] yeah
[1:18:03] because you could be saying in the
[1:18:05] beginning before the eternal before he
[1:18:07] moved over into the or developed into
[1:18:10] the form to say let there be
[1:18:12] and then you'll start time on the basis
[1:18:14] of not time 24 hours a day you started a
[1:18:18] element because you're still back in
[1:18:20] eternity that's why john 1 1 is not over
[1:18:23] in genesis 1. that's where we always put
[1:18:25] it we're going to put john 1 1 in the
[1:18:27] beginning was the word word with god in
[1:18:28] the word was god we're going to put that
[1:18:30] over in genesis 1 where it said and god
[1:18:32] made
[1:18:33] the heavens and the earth
[1:18:35] that's okay that's in the beginning
[1:18:37] but going back in the beginning before
[1:18:39] the eternal back up into heaven with it
[1:18:42] and let him stand our as the word
[1:18:46] let him stand there as the word
[1:18:49] that can speak
[1:18:51] let that word let him speak his thought
[1:18:55] there's in the beginning
[1:18:57] was the word
[1:18:59] all the way back in eternity
[1:19:01] you have the word beginning
[1:19:06] now see then that's the way brother
[1:19:09] around uses it because through this
[1:19:11] message i brought these things out
[1:19:13] you know
[1:19:14] anything else
[1:19:16] all right who'll be next we've got about
[1:19:18] 20 minutes who's the next brother dean
[1:19:28] he would have finally had the child yeah
[1:19:30] now how she had that's you covered it
[1:19:34] for diamonds right i can't see
[1:19:36] her and adam
[1:19:38] before the fall had in producing christ
[1:19:41] i believe this is the only way
[1:19:44] that it could be and as far as uh
[1:19:46] receiving uh uh
[1:19:48] even receiving the holy ghost i like to
[1:19:50] call her a woman called when she come
[1:19:52] forth from adam she was still a woman
[1:19:55] and uh
[1:19:56] just like pentecost
[1:19:58] he separated himself 120 times and come
[1:20:02] in he had to give evil when she come
[1:20:04] forth from the flesh he don't only give
[1:20:06] her a soul but he'd give her a spirit
[1:20:09] and give her eternal life just like he
[1:20:11] gave him eternal life at pentecost
[1:20:14] so i mean it's pretty simple to me you
[1:20:17] know of course if it's revealed to you
[1:20:18] it is simple right but uh but that's
[1:20:21] what brother brown said he said she
[1:20:22] would have finally had the child exactly
[1:20:26] but i believe it
[1:20:29] let me put this in there while somebody
[1:20:31] who's next and he put this in there
[1:20:34] you know that god can speak the word
[1:20:38] but that ain't the way he wants it
[1:20:41] you know what
[1:20:42] he wants you to say
[1:20:49] let me quote a random
[1:20:51] moses got the thought
[1:20:54] he said it ain't word yet
[1:20:57] he says then the thought comes from god
[1:20:59] to moses moses got the thought he said
[1:21:00] then he went out and spoke it said then
[1:21:02] it become the word see god wants you to
[1:21:04] speak the word
[1:21:06] that's the whole thing
[1:21:09] but that's what people see they get that
[1:21:11] well brother branham was the only one to
[1:21:12] speak the word show me that in the bible
[1:21:14] and she'll read that in the prophet's
[1:21:15] message
[1:21:17] no
[1:21:19] we won't be like him we're not trying to
[1:21:20] be like him
[1:21:22] he'll tell you what i don't even want
[1:21:24] the thing the ministry i've got let
[1:21:26] alone what he had
[1:21:29] and that's as honest as i can be
[1:21:32] i could go home at night and lay down
[1:21:34] and go to sleep
[1:21:36] i wouldn't have to put on no sleep acne
[1:21:38] machine to get
[1:21:42] if i didn't have to preach
[1:21:44] you don't have to brother they'll know
[1:21:46] sir but
[1:21:47] somebody's got to do it so i'll do my
[1:21:49] part all right
[1:21:51] but do you understand who's next
[1:21:56] who be next any more questions
[1:21:58] because i don't mind going this
[1:21:59] afternoon with them because
[1:22:01] i love them
[1:22:03] i was going to add more to what brother
[1:22:05] dean said really there's no reason he
[1:22:08] couldn't have given eve eternal life
[1:22:09] because
[1:22:11] there was no sin
[1:22:12] he wants to give eternal life to
[1:22:13] everybody exactly he can't when we're
[1:22:16] naturally born in this world because of
[1:22:18] sin
[1:22:20] we're born and sin and shaped in
[1:22:21] iniquity so he has to
[1:22:23] you know bring us through his salvation
[1:22:24] redemption plan right
[1:22:26] can i ask you a question too about that
[1:22:28] logos go ahead
[1:22:30] i made the comment in
[1:22:31] the sunday school class a while back
[1:22:34] and uh i should have checked with you
[1:22:36] first before i
[1:22:37] announce it to the before i
[1:22:39] mentioned it to the class but what i'd
[1:22:41] said was that god
[1:22:43] deals with us through language
[1:22:45] and that from that logos as part of that
[1:22:47] because that's the word form of god
[1:22:50] there had to be language brought forth
[1:22:51] there too exactly because if we didn't
[1:22:54] have language we couldn't receive god
[1:22:57] faith comes by hearing
[1:22:59] and hearing by the word
[1:23:01] we listen to the tapes we listen we read
[1:23:03] the books we
[1:23:04] uh talk with each other about the word
[1:23:06] and through that we receive christ
[1:23:08] so where will we be with that language
[1:23:10] right
[1:23:11] and when he confounded the language at
[1:23:13] babel
[1:23:14] you know he might he specifically said
[1:23:16] jesus said the great commission go into
[1:23:18] all the world and to preach to every
[1:23:20] nation
[1:23:21] because they weren't one speech anymore
[1:23:23] right so that was a language barrier
[1:23:25] exactly so he made sure to say bring it
[1:23:28] to every nation
[1:23:30] and that's our commission even to the
[1:23:32] creature she said to every creature
[1:23:35] so anyway that's all i was going to say
[1:23:38] do you know that how many let's let's
[1:23:40] give a number
[1:23:41] let's say there's 10 000 different
[1:23:43] languages in the world this is a number
[1:23:45] okay
[1:23:47] you know that's logos
[1:23:50] you understand what i just said that's
[1:23:52] logos because he can speak in any
[1:23:54] language
[1:23:55] remember on the day of pentecost it was
[1:23:58] one man speaking in one language
[1:24:01] it wasn't a denominational idea that
[1:24:03] there's 120 interpreters you know that's
[1:24:06] what they think it won't work because
[1:24:08] the bible said out here we every man in
[1:24:10] our own tongue we're in we are born
[1:24:15] brother branham one day he's talking to
[1:24:17] something with a girl and
[1:24:18] and the girl through the interpreter
[1:24:20] said i thought he didn't understand i
[1:24:21] thought he could something he spoke the
[1:24:23] language he spoke in english it was
[1:24:25] interpreted one way or the other
[1:24:27] it went right straight to the other
[1:24:29] language
[1:24:30] that's the logos
[1:24:32] that's the speech
[1:24:34] all
[1:24:35] languages are speech
[1:24:37] communication speech is what an ability
[1:24:40] to communicate
[1:24:42] and that's what we do whether it be
[1:24:45] or whatever you know
[1:24:47] it's like i always say we go up north
[1:24:49] and that's southern folks we tell them
[1:24:51] say what do you want to eat with some
[1:24:52] maters and taters
[1:24:54] and they'll laugh at you all the way in
[1:24:56] the back you know and they'll get in
[1:24:58] there and joke about you but they'll
[1:24:59] bring you some maters and taters
[1:25:03] you come south and you get those
[1:25:05] northern people and they say i want some
[1:25:07] tomatoes and potatoes and they'll say
[1:25:09] what'd you say
[1:25:13] language is a communication gap
[1:25:17] you just think god can understand every
[1:25:19] language in the world
[1:25:23] that's wonderful anybody else will
[1:25:35] i'd like to say something about you talk
[1:25:37] about beyond the curtain of time
[1:25:39] uh and i was i've been thinking a lot
[1:25:41] about this uh
[1:25:42] when uh
[1:25:43] david nunez passed away here to show a
[1:25:46] while back i got to think about it one
[1:25:48] time one day i said well he's there
[1:25:51] beyond the curtain of time because i
[1:25:52] believe that yeah but when you when you
[1:25:54] die you give up the ghosts and on this
[1:25:56] side right here and you go there you
[1:25:59] enter into another position
[1:26:02] that that though nothing have to be
[1:26:04] added to you that you can come and pick
[1:26:06] up this body
[1:26:08] you come you can have come back into
[1:26:11] your thinking what you bypass when you
[1:26:14] come into the world exactly you're right
[1:26:16] back that's why sharon rose know their
[1:26:18] daddy and everything right that's why
[1:26:20] our sister sister hope was there and
[1:26:22] different ones you know and they said
[1:26:24] when brother brown said there uh uh will
[1:26:27] paul group make it it says yes i preach
[1:26:30] this is exactly what paul says they all
[1:26:32] screamed out exactly we were arrested on
[1:26:34] that exactly so
[1:26:35] so that takes the fear
[1:26:38] out of anybody that really has an idea
[1:26:42] if you have to go by the ground if you
[1:26:43] leave your time out and you have to go
[1:26:45] by the ground and you enter into that
[1:26:49] your theory goes into that place
[1:26:53] you're all you're waiting on is just the
[1:26:55] rest of us to get right
[1:26:57] and and and bring you out of there
[1:26:58] because nothing else got to be added to
[1:27:00] you you'll come and pick his body up in
[1:27:02] a glorified state and together with us
[1:27:05] we can go into his presence here because
[1:27:07] we've got glorified bodies right
[1:27:09] because that's the same thing statue of
[1:27:11] perfect man you're born again right here
[1:27:13] at faith
[1:27:16] is that holy spirit here that even the
[1:27:18] faith of the father is put right here
[1:27:20] with holy spirit is that any more holy
[1:27:23] spirit than this or a different no is
[1:27:25] that love a different one no
[1:27:27] it's what you're manifesting what it is
[1:27:30] so is it with your soul being your
[1:27:32] theophany
[1:27:35] it's eternal life
[1:27:38] that's the only way
[1:27:40] it can be there in here
[1:27:43] is this be eternal and that be eternal
[1:27:45] and there's no such thing as two
[1:27:47] eternities
[1:27:49] it's one man let's stand we
[1:27:51] we won't sing nothing with us
[1:27:54] we'll think of a verse or something
[1:27:56] anybody has a need for prayer then come
[1:27:58] ahead we won't do the musicians because
[1:28:00] it's tyndale all right
