[0:04] god bless you saints
[0:06] you glad to be in the house of the lord
[0:07] this morning
[0:10] it's good to come to church
[0:17] yeah and we're certainly glad to have
[0:18] the porters with us this morning
[0:22] had some good fellowship with them last
[0:24] night and uh really appreciate them
[0:29] trying to figure out how to get my
[0:38] i don't know where my button went so
[0:39] i'll just
[0:41] we'll just carry on like this we've been
[0:44] studying on the book of hebrews and uh
[0:46] and and made it to hebrews chapter six
[0:49] so let's just um
[0:54] i don't know
[0:56] anyway
[0:58] i don't know where my button went but
[0:59] we'll try to make the best of it let's
[1:01] let's pray before we get into our study
[1:03] lord jesus we're so grateful to be able
[1:05] to gather together around your word and
[1:06] we just ask lord as we just study out
[1:08] these little verses in hebrews lord that
[1:10] you'll just open it up to us lord and
[1:12] quicken the word to us lord and give us
[1:14] what we have need of this morning as
[1:16] brother wade's studying and preparing
[1:17] lord jesus that our hearts will be an
[1:18] expectation and you'll just be with us
[1:20] today we ask your blessing upon you the
[1:22] reading of your word now in your name
[1:25] so hebrews chapter 6 if we just kind of
[1:27] background on the
[1:28] last few verses it says therefore
[1:30] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[1:31] of christ let us go on unto perfection
[1:34] not laying again the foundation of
[1:36] repentance from dead works and of faith
[1:37] toward god of the doctrine of baptism
[1:40] and of laying on of hands
[1:42] and of resurrection of the dead
[1:45] and of eternal judgment and this will we
[1:47] do if god permit
[1:49] for it is impossible for those who are
[1:51] once enlightened and have tasted of the
[1:53] heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[1:55] the holy ghost and have tasted the good
[1:56] work of word of god and the powers of
[1:58] the world to come
[2:00] if they shall fall away to renew them
[2:02] again unto repentance seeing they
[2:03] crucify to themselves the son of god
[2:05] afresh
[2:07] and put him to an open shame
[2:09] so just the background briefly we were
[2:11] talking about how paul's saying that let
[2:13] let's you you start on your journey you
[2:15] lay the foundation but let's go on to
[2:17] perfection let's go on to run that race
[2:19] well
[2:21] so you've got your foundation of
[2:23] repentance from dead works and all these
[2:25] all these foundational doctrines of
[2:26] faith toward god and what it means to be
[2:28] born again and how to be baptized and
[2:31] and all of these foundational doctrines
[2:33] but let's let's go on and grow and so he
[2:36] as he as he as we go through this
[2:38] chapter he gets to this this may be
[2:41] difficult like like like what peter said
[2:43] peter would say that many of the things
[2:45] paul said is hard to understand and you
[2:47] get to verse 4 and he says for it is
[2:49] impossible for those who are once
[2:51] enlightened that have tasted of the
[2:52] heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[2:54] the holy ghost and have tasted the good
[2:56] word of god and the powers of the world
[2:58] to come if they shall fall away to renew
[2:59] them again and repent us
[3:02] so
[3:02] that's maybe a scripture that many have
[3:05] wrestled with over the years so we just
[3:06] want to kind of uh break this down and
[3:08] unpack it this morning and look at all
[3:10] the all the good treasures that are
[3:11] stored up in this verse because it's
[3:13] it's really weighty and you really
[3:15] really just kind of set the stage what
[3:17] what paul's talking here is that
[3:19] the light of the word you have to keep
[3:21] up with it
[3:22] in every age as as martin when martin
[3:25] luther preached his message that was
[3:26] that was that was the light for that age
[3:28] and the people in that age believed what
[3:30] he preached and and and were born again
[3:32] by believing that message in his age but
[3:34] then john wesley got uh showed there was
[3:37] a little bit more light in the word when
[3:38] he began to preach and you got to keep
[3:41] up with the word
[3:42] and if you don't if you don't keep up
[3:44] with the word uh when the word is made
[3:46] manifest in your age and it comes and
[3:48] it's presented plainly before you and
[3:50] you you partake of the you're sitting in
[3:52] church and you're partaking of the holy
[3:53] ghost and yet you don't go on all the
[3:56] way and you to reject and you and you
[3:58] and you come to a place where the word
[3:59] is is plainly before you and you say
[4:02] well i i don't believe it i'm i'm going
[4:04] to turn around and go away
[4:06] and reject it
[4:08] maybe maybe this morning you think as we
[4:10] kind of dive into this think about all
[4:11] the maybe scenarios and and and things
[4:14] that you've seen in your life where
[4:15] where people have maybe preached the
[4:17] preached the message for 40 or 50 years
[4:19] and then all of a sudden they come to a
[4:20] place where you know like like judas or
[4:23] or dathon and cora and they and they
[4:26] come to a place where you know i i
[4:28] i never really believed it to begin with
[4:30] but yet they were partakers of the of
[4:32] the holy ghost the baptism of the holy
[4:33] ghost on their spirit
[4:36] they sat in meetings and rejoiced and
[4:37] yet they they at the end of the road and
[4:40] i see what paul's talking about he's
[4:41] talking about you you got to come to the
[4:42] end
[4:44] your your your end is really when when
[4:46] the fruit is manifested when it when the
[4:48] plant grows up it really shows
[4:50] where you started from so we want our
[4:53] end
[4:54] we want to we want to raise like paul
[4:55] said run this race well because it
[4:57] there's only one that wins the race and
[4:59] that's the the one that crosses the
[5:00] finish line
[5:02] so
[5:03] think of uh when as he was saying in
[5:05] hebrews chapter six verse one let us go
[5:07] on unto perfection not laying again the
[5:09] foundation of repentance from dead works
[5:11] and of faith toward god so as you're
[5:12] going on it's like like like climbing
[5:15] jacob's ladder and you're moving on
[5:17] climbing up through stages like martin
[5:20] luther john wesley azuza street
[5:23] the headstone
[5:25] and you got to as those lights in that
[5:27] candlestick that brother ram talked
[5:28] about as those messengers preached their
[5:30] message you got to stay aligned with the
[5:33] messenger message for your day
[5:35] as the word it keeps moving on like just
[5:38] like the wheat plant from the the the
[5:41] planting from the the stalk and all the
[5:43] way up to the to the actual grain being
[5:46] manifested again
[5:48] so
[5:49] let's let's kind of dive into that a
[5:51] little bit more he said
[5:52] let's read those verses again three to
[5:54] six and this what we do if god permit
[5:57] for it is impossible for those who were
[5:59] once enlightened
[6:01] and have tasted of the heavenly gift
[6:03] and were made partakers of the holy
[6:05] ghost sat in meetings and shouted and
[6:07] more partakers
[6:09] and
[6:10] what are we talking about this morning
[6:11] we're really talking about anointed ones
[6:14] and have tasted the good word of god
[6:16] and the powers of the world to come
[6:19] if they shall fall away to renew them
[6:20] again unto repentance seeing they
[6:22] crucified themselves the son of god
[6:23] afresh and put him to an open shame
[6:26] let's uh let's let's let's read that in
[6:29] a different translation
[6:30] the erv and i know sometimes we stumble
[6:32] at different translations and things but
[6:34] you know my my stance on it really is if
[6:36] it'll if it'll help me understand i
[6:39] you know
[6:39] you you you want to be careful of course
[6:42] but if there's anything that can help me
[6:43] understand i want to take advantage of
[6:45] it so this is this is maybe maybe
[6:47] simplified uh a lot but the erv says
[6:50] after people have left the way of christ
[6:52] can you make them change their lives
[6:53] again
[6:54] and paul's talking about people who once
[6:56] learned the truth received god's gift
[6:58] and shared in the holy spirit
[7:00] and
[7:01] and in other words the baptism the holy
[7:03] ghost was was present in their life you
[7:05] think about how the uh when the when the
[7:07] apostles were first commissioned that
[7:09] jesus told them to go cast out devils
[7:11] and preach the gospel and yet they
[7:13] didn't have the new birth yet but they
[7:15] were they were anointed with the with
[7:16] the holy ghost on their spirit to go and
[7:19] cast out devils
[7:21] but without the new birth
[7:23] they were blessed to hear god's good
[7:25] message and see the great power of his
[7:27] new world and but then they left it all
[7:29] behind and it's not possible to make
[7:31] them change again that's because those
[7:33] who leave christ are nailing him to the
[7:35] cross again shaming him before everyone
[7:37] so you see when you when you reject what
[7:39] why did they nail him to the cross to
[7:40] begin with because they rejected his
[7:42] message
[7:43] think of that picture of pilot uh pilot
[7:46] there
[7:47] saying i find no fault in him and they
[7:49] and they went and nailed him to the
[7:50] cross because they rejected him as as
[7:52] they rejected everything he stood for
[7:54] and and what's that what will happen
[7:56] again in the end times they reject his
[7:57] message and that's why brother brown
[7:59] preached that message the indictment i
[8:01] indict this generation
[8:03] for crucifying christ afresh because
[8:05] they rejected his message again
[8:08] the denominational people of the day
[8:10] they they got so they got so uh they
[8:12] cabbage down on the the the
[8:14] what they believed to be the truth and
[8:16] they could not go on with the light as
[8:18] the light of uh the light of the spirit
[8:21] showing more light upon his word they
[8:22] couldn't keep pace with it
[8:26] so brother brown what he would say in
[8:27] the anointed ones at the end time
[8:29] he was in the blades he was in the
[8:30] tassel he was in the shuck but now he's
[8:32] in the grain now you go back and try to
[8:35] live again now he's trying he's trying
[8:36] to elaborate on what paul's saying here
[8:38] in verses three to six
[8:41] what if that like life took back down
[8:43] you think that left life would ever go
[8:45] go talk whatever talk go back after that
[8:47] old shuck has dried up ever go back and
[8:49] live in it again
[8:51] it never does
[8:53] for it is impossible for those who were
[8:55] once enlightened and didn't move on with
[8:57] the word as it come to pass
[9:00] they are dead gone and the thorns and
[9:02] thistles which is nigh and rejection
[9:04] whose end is to be burned
[9:06] is that right so he's saying if you
[9:08] don't think think of it like brother
[9:10] brown would say the you know the the
[9:11] psalm says that word to me is a a a lamp
[9:14] to my feet and a light to my path as the
[9:17] it's like a light that's shining where
[9:20] where you should put your foot next
[9:22] and if you don't if you get out of the
[9:24] light that's shining on your path then
[9:27] you're in darkness so you've got to keep
[9:29] pat pace with that light and how do you
[9:32] keep pace with the light is by believing
[9:34] the message for your day
[9:36] that's what that's why brother adam
[9:37] would reiterate over and over again
[9:39] we're not we're not believing noah's
[9:41] message
[9:42] or or moses message or or martin
[9:44] luther's message or john wesley's
[9:46] message
[9:47] but we're believing a present tense
[9:50] revelation for this hour right what's
[9:53] the present tense revelation for this
[9:55] hour what are we supposed to believe in
[9:56] this hour the headstone ministry of the
[9:58] full word being restored
[10:00] the capstone message
[10:02] so as brother bro as martin luther would
[10:05] what
[10:05] the message kept going on from martin
[10:07] luther and martin luther's message was
[10:09] in romans 1 17 that just you're
[10:11] justified by faith and john wesley's
[10:13] message in first thessalonians 5 23 the
[10:17] very god of peace sanctify you holy
[10:19] and azusa street that a promise that the
[10:21] spirit will be restored and and the
[10:23] signs and wonders and things will be
[10:25] restored back to the people but you see
[10:27] you keep climbing up and you've got to
[10:29] keep pace with it
[10:32] and when their eyes were open they knew
[10:33] him he said as i referred last night
[10:35] moses couldn't have come with noah's
[10:37] message neither could jesus come with
[10:39] moses message see it was so it was
[10:41] lauded for each hour
[10:43] now we couldn't come with luther's
[10:44] message neither with the wesley and
[10:46] neither with a pentecostal message we're
[10:48] plumb beyond that
[10:50] you say oh that's something well so did
[10:52] the catholic church think luther was
[10:54] making it up
[10:55] so did wesley think that the the
[10:57] lutheran think that wesley was making it
[10:58] up so did the wesleys think that the
[11:01] pentecost was making it up
[11:02] but the thing of it is look back in the
[11:05] scriptures it identifies every age and
[11:08] if the things that he is doing now
[11:10] doesn't identify him the promises of god
[11:13] then leave it alone
[11:14] you every single one of these messengers
[11:16] could identify their message in the
[11:18] bible and that's the same thing and
[11:20] today we can identify our our message
[11:22] the message that we've heard by looking
[11:24] at malachi 4 and luke 17
[11:27] and uh revelation 10
[11:29] and ephesians 4 and and 2nd peter and
[11:33] all of these things as the bible opens
[11:34] up you can identify what you believe by
[11:36] looking at the journey of ruth at the
[11:39] streets three stages of abraham at the
[11:41] three stages of david's life and you can
[11:44] as you as the message opens up it
[11:46] becomes identified in the scripture that
[11:47] that's why he's saying we're not just
[11:49] making stuff up we're not just believing
[11:51] something that just some man
[11:53] came up with
[11:54] but we believe what we're actually
[11:56] believing what the bible says and the
[11:58] message that we've heard has shown light
[12:01] on what the scripture is actually hidden
[12:03] in the scripture
[12:05] so brother brown will say again and he
[12:06] said in questions and answers number
[12:08] three he said there's nobody can say a
[12:10] word against them fine religious people
[12:12] they're just as nice as they can be
[12:14] church of god nazarene free methodists
[12:17] those people are real but when it comes
[12:19] down to the works of the spirit they say
[12:21] oh that's the devil see how you got to
[12:25] keep pace with the message of the hour
[12:27] that's what paul's talking about here in
[12:29] hebrews chapter six and and when you
[12:31] keep pace when you're believing the
[12:33] message for your day and and the message
[12:36] for your day actually opens up to you
[12:38] and you begin to see what the prophet in
[12:40] this day really was preaching about that
[12:42] and we'll find out that brother brown
[12:44] said that is really the evidence of the
[12:45] new birth that the message for your day
[12:48] is revealed to you
[12:49] and he'll say so there's nobody can say
[12:51] a word against them people they're nice
[12:53] people in the in all the different
[12:55] denominations but when it comes down to
[12:56] the works of the spirit they say that's
[12:58] the devil
[12:59] just like they did when jesus was
[13:01] manifested in the flesh
[13:03] when he walked on the place they looked
[13:04] at his life and they said well that's
[13:05] bl's above and that's you're you're that
[13:08] uh
[13:09] i said all the different kind of things
[13:11] about him the pharisees with all their
[13:12] the their
[13:14] all all their their spiritual religious
[13:16] works but yet they could deny the word
[13:18] when it was made plain before them
[13:21] and he said what'd they do there
[13:22] blaspheme the holy ghost
[13:24] now what is blasphemy there's no
[13:26] forgiveness he said he that once
[13:28] enlightened
[13:29] made partakers and tasted of the
[13:31] heavenly gifts
[13:32] tasted of god's sanctification
[13:35] cleaned up from cigarettes and filthy
[13:37] women and all kinds of life like that
[13:40] and tasted of the heavenly things to see
[13:43] that they'll walk up to that borderline
[13:45] like those spies did that eat part of
[13:46] the grapes but what do they have to do
[13:48] they had to break up their denomination
[13:50] to come over into this and what it all
[13:53] boils down into is that they rejected
[13:55] the word when it was presented plainly
[13:57] before them even though the spirit was
[13:59] working in their life and maybe they
[14:01] could cast out devils and maybe they
[14:02] were preaching the gospel that yet when
[14:03] the word was presented in before them
[14:06] they rejected it
[14:07] and so brother brahman in the message
[14:09] indictment he said now the same they do
[14:11] the same today they deny and crucify the
[14:14] same god today by not knowing him the
[14:17] same by denying him and doing by denying
[14:20] the things that they're doing today they
[14:21] don't crucify christ again exactly but
[14:24] they blaspheme the holy ghost
[14:26] and if we skip down to the last
[14:27] paragraph he said and jesus said i'll
[14:29] forgive you for that but when the holy
[14:30] ghost has come
[14:32] remember it will and cannot by no means
[14:34] no mercy when you blaspheme and call the
[14:36] spirit of god the word of god that's
[14:38] being vindicated by the spirit though
[14:40] see the word says so the spirit is
[14:43] vindicating it and you call it an
[14:45] unclean thing you've crossed the line
[14:47] between mercy and judgment and can never
[14:49] be forgiven for it
[14:52] to reject what god has done for you and
[14:55] you you see what what it really is
[14:59] in every age to receive the message for
[15:01] your day
[15:02] is the evidence of the new birth so if
[15:05] you come all the way through
[15:06] justification and look at that path of a
[15:08] christian from through justification and
[15:10] sanctification
[15:12] all those things are works of the holy
[15:13] spirit in your life it takes the holy of
[15:15] the holy ghost to speak to a person and
[15:17] cause them to turn around start going in
[15:19] a different direction through
[15:20] justification and to begin confess that
[15:22] jesus christ has forgiven them of their
[15:24] sins it takes the work of the holy
[15:26] spirit in their life to begin to drive
[15:28] out the cigarettes and clean up their
[15:29] life and all those things in
[15:30] sanctification it's it's god actually
[15:33] doing it in a believer's life where they
[15:35] come to church and they want to start
[15:36] going to church and they want to be
[15:37] religious and they want to act like a
[15:39] christian they want to do right
[15:41] and so they're partaking of the holy
[15:43] ghost the holy ghost is maybe anointing
[15:45] them maybe they start they they feel
[15:46] like they should be a preacher and they
[15:48] start preaching but yet
[15:50] you you've the the the the hone in time
[15:53] the the the the the question is have you
[15:56] received the word for your day
[15:58] and that's the evidence of the baptism
[16:00] of the holy ghost that the the new birth
[16:02] in a believer's life
[16:04] so brother brahman's murder in church he
[16:06] said now we have been constantly saying
[16:08] that the true evidence of being baptized
[16:10] with the holy ghost is for the believer
[16:12] to receive the word for the age in which
[16:14] he lives now see that doesn't mean just
[16:16] say well i believe god sent a prophet
[16:18] but that's to believe what that prophet
[16:20] brought to receive that into your heart
[16:23] and let it become let it become manifest
[16:25] in your life so that your works change
[16:27] and your life changes and you're acting
[16:29] different and thinking different
[16:30] to receive the word for the age in which
[16:32] he lives now see where's that in the
[16:34] bible in revelation chapter 3 verse 22
[16:36] says he that hath an ear let him hear
[16:39] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[16:42] and how is he going to say anything to
[16:43] the churches by those seven messengers
[16:46] he said it to the churches he spoke it
[16:48] to the churches by paul and irenaeus and
[16:50] martin columba and luther and wesley and
[16:53] now through brother branham
[16:55] he spoke it to us and that's how you
[16:56] know what he won't say to the church
[16:58] because you listen you listen to what
[17:00] the messenger said and you subject
[17:03] yourself to the word for your age and it
[17:06] becomes fruitful in your life
[17:09] now you think about all the examples of
[17:11] of of these scriptures that paul's
[17:13] talking about that have tasted the good
[17:16] word of god
[17:17] and the powers of the world to come
[17:19] if they shall fall away to renew them
[17:21] again unto repentance seeing they
[17:22] crucify to themselves the son of god
[17:24] afresh and put him to an open chain
[17:26] examples in the scripture of word
[17:28] rejecters people that benefited from the
[17:31] from the supernatural working in their
[17:32] life like dathan
[17:34] and cora and in the old testament that
[17:37] walked with the children of israel
[17:38] through through the wilderness and they
[17:40] saw the pillar of fire and they ate the
[17:42] manna but yet they refused to believe
[17:45] that they could go into the promised
[17:46] land that refused to accept the message
[17:49] that moses was preaching the 10 line
[17:51] spies that said well we're not able to
[17:53] take it after all the the evidence that
[17:55] they had seen that the word had been
[17:57] laid out plainly before them and they
[17:59] saw the the water come from the rock and
[18:02] they saw
[18:03] bread
[18:06] food prepared for them and every every
[18:08] material need met and yet they failed to
[18:11] believe that god's word was true and
[18:13] judas that walked and talked with jesus
[18:15] and was so close to him until brother
[18:18] and said nobody knew the difference the
[18:20] only one that knew what was really in
[18:21] jesus's heart was jesus
[18:25] and he walked with him and and cast out
[18:27] devils and was with him the whole time
[18:29] and
[18:29] and it and until the very end when he
[18:32] rejected the word you think about the
[18:34] the self-righteous pharisees too that
[18:36] thought that they knew
[18:37] what god wanted done with the word like
[18:40] in mark chapter 12 it said then they
[18:41] said unto him certain of the pharisees
[18:43] and of the herodians to catch him in his
[18:44] words and when they were come they say
[18:46] unto him master
[18:48] we know that thou art true they were
[18:50] confessing that jesus was true and care
[18:52] is for no man that for thou regardless
[18:54] not the person of men but teach us the
[18:56] way of god and truth but yet they
[18:58] couldn't go on with the word
[19:00] they benefited they benefited from his
[19:02] ministry but they couldn't go on with
[19:03] the word
[19:05] that's why paul's saying in verse 4 it
[19:07] is impossible for those who were once
[19:09] enlightened
[19:10] and have tasted of the heavenly gift
[19:13] and were made partakers of the holy
[19:14] ghost
[19:16] in mark chapter 3
[19:17] he ordained 12 that they should be with
[19:19] him and that he might send them forth to
[19:20] preach and have power to heal sicknesses
[19:22] and to cast out devils
[19:24] see they were once enlightened and they
[19:25] were partakers of the holy ghost
[19:27] in luke chapter 22 and while he had
[19:29] spake behold a multitude of he and he
[19:31] that was called judas one of the twelve
[19:34] went before them and drew near unto
[19:35] jesus to kiss him because if
[19:38] a man so close to jesus that he would
[19:41] betray him with a kiss
[19:44] so close to jesus
[19:47] and the seed of discrepancy brother
[19:49] brown said judas only played church he
[19:52] wasn't really sincere
[19:54] he didn't actually have faith
[19:56] he'd have never betrayed jesus
[19:58] but see he sowed that seed of
[20:00] discrepancy he thought that he could
[20:02] make friends with the world mammon and
[20:04] also have friendship with jesus but it
[20:06] was too late for him to do anything
[20:08] about it
[20:09] when the dead hour came when he did this
[20:10] evil thing he crossed the separating
[20:12] line between going forward
[20:14] and returning back
[20:16] and then the sardisian church age
[20:18] brother ram said you can't go along with
[20:20] just part of the word you have to take
[20:22] all the word there are people who seem
[20:24] involved in the things of god almost 100
[20:26] percent
[20:28] they are like judas no one but jesus
[20:30] knew exactly what kind of a person judas
[20:33] was
[20:34] so the day came that judas did exactly
[20:36] what israel did at bail pior he decided
[20:38] that he wanted to join with the false
[20:40] divine forces
[20:42] enter into the financial political
[20:44] organization of anti-word anti-christ
[20:46] religion and he did so
[20:48] he was fooled the other 11 were not they
[20:51] could not be for they were of the very
[20:52] elect
[20:54] so when judas left and betrayed the lord
[20:55] his name was removed from the book of
[20:57] life
[20:58] what's what's the difference between a
[21:00] fake a fake and a genuine christian
[21:02] both can rejoice in the spirit both can
[21:05] come into church and and take advantage
[21:07] of the of the spirit movement in the
[21:08] church but a genuine a genuine will have
[21:11] that seed sown down in their heart
[21:14] and the pergamian church agent said now
[21:16] let me tell you
[21:17] and you know hebrews chapter six is the
[21:19] is the answer when brother brown uh he
[21:22] he told that story of
[21:23] of uh
[21:24] seeing the two men rejoicing and and one
[21:26] was living in sin and one was doing uh
[21:29] things wrong i think living in adultery
[21:31] and
[21:32] and uh
[21:34] and the lord took him over to the side
[21:35] and and began to reveal him uh uh
[21:38] turned him uh took him over to hebrews
[21:40] chapter six and he's telling this story
[21:42] he said he were two men one of which was
[21:45] a real believer and the other was a
[21:46] sinful impersonator yet both were
[21:48] manifesting gifts of the spirit
[21:50] i was troubled by this confusing
[21:53] confusion and he said i left the meeting
[21:55] to seek god for the answer i went along
[21:57] to a secret place and there with my
[21:58] bible i prayed and waited on god for the
[22:00] answer
[22:01] not knowing just what portion of
[22:03] scripture to read i casually opened the
[22:04] bible someplace in matthew i read for a
[22:07] while and then laid the bible down and a
[22:09] moment a wind blew into the room and
[22:11] turned the pages of the bible to hebrews
[22:13] chapter 6.
[22:14] i read it through and was particularly
[22:16] impressed by those strange verses
[22:19] he said
[22:21] he told the story about how man went and
[22:23] sewed wheat
[22:25] and another man went behind him and
[22:26] sowed tears and the wheat and the tares
[22:28] grew together and they particularly the
[22:30] same nourishment out of the same soul
[22:32] they drank in the same sun
[22:35] and rain and then he said i knew the
[22:37] truth then i knew the truth of the camp
[22:38] meeting and the vision the parable of
[22:40] the sower and the seed the sixth chapter
[22:43] of hebrews and the evident manifestation
[22:46] of spiritual gifts in a mixed audience
[22:48] all became wonderfully clear
[22:51] the sower in white was the lord the
[22:52] sower in black was the devil the world
[22:55] was the field
[22:56] the seeds were people
[22:58] elect and reprobate
[23:01] both partook of the same nourishment
[23:04] water and sun
[23:05] both prayed
[23:07] both received help from god for he
[23:09] maketh his son and reign to fall on both
[23:11] good and evil
[23:12] and though they both had the same
[23:14] wonderful blessing and both have the
[23:16] same wonderful manifestations
[23:19] they will steal that great want that one
[23:21] great difference
[23:23] they were of different
[23:25] seed
[23:26] you see there's what makes the
[23:27] difference what seed you're of i see he
[23:30] he's providing an example that you know
[23:33] usually when brother around would talk
[23:34] about seed
[23:35] there's there's two different ways that
[23:37] he's going the same way with scripture
[23:39] there's see there's seed that god
[23:40] thought of you before the foundation of
[23:42] the world but that had to be that word
[23:44] had to be sown into your heart so that
[23:47] that seed that's sown into your heart
[23:48] he's speaking of now
[23:50] what seed have you received into your
[23:52] heart because all the baptisms of the
[23:54] holy ghost and your spirit and on your
[23:56] flesh
[23:57] that's wonderful to get into a
[23:58] congregation and to rejoice with other
[24:00] believers but have you received the
[24:02] message for your day
[24:03] have you heard what the spirit wants to
[24:05] say to the church because when you sit
[24:08] subject yourself to the word for your
[24:10] day that is the true evidence of the
[24:11] holy ghost in your life the musicians
[24:14] can go ahead and come forward and we'll
[24:15] we'll uh
[24:18] let me skip through some of these before
[24:20] and we'll just close
[24:21] you see on the
[24:23] uh on the on these people that turn back
[24:25] their their body and their spirit maybe
[24:27] were anointed by the holy ghost but down
[24:30] in their soul it was still black
[24:32] but when you receive the word for your
[24:34] age and the spirit quickens it in your
[24:36] soul and comes to life that is the true
[24:39] evidence of the new birth
[24:42] and we'll just stop right there god god
[24:44] bless you all
[24:46] [Applause]
[25:05] so
[25:23] you
