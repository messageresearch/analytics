========================================

our 32 parts on the hill 70 weeks and for those of you that just came in does anybody have a Virgina must not be earth is anybody help hey seventy weeks of Daniel book that they borrowed no I kind of figured see the Regina are our it's either Regina are the West maybe they they've got sister Cletus book that she loaned us so we need to try to get it back so what we're doing now is if we're trying to now begin into the Seventh Seal and we last Sunday we touched on a few things and we started reading the Bible so we're going to go back again anybody seen this and go back to Isaiah 29 because the seals you see I have seven seals it must come everything must come from the Bible right everything must come from the bottom so God talks about a seal all the way through the Bible we didn't even hardly get into the New Testament last Sunday so we're going to try to skip there real quick I was there 29 and some of the others and then we'll go down into the New Testament alright and then we'll read in Revelation all right everybody got that everybody out there you don't have to get out of their way not you read around here I said it speaking what and the vision of all is becoming to you as the words of a book that is sealed okay this Bible is sealed to the world but yeah you can physically open it right many denominations who preach out of this millions of denominations will preach their variation of scripture out of this one book but if it's not a true revelation from God if they did not come from the mind of God this to me came this is the mind of God made my offense cry then the books clothes I don't care how much they read it the book is closed okay but now to the bride of Jesus Christ in this end time we have so much revelation to where we know that the books open we can read what's in the book we can read what the mind of God has already told us and we can see that though down through the ages I told many times good have such humans tonight and then mr. of our generation a sweetheart so anyway play the lakes energy the lazy people to do it no don't relate on the coffee jazz that she's dog sitting for my grandbaby while they're gone on vacation anyway now this seals in the old time you remember they had a scroll at a piece of paper with me what to do I find one remember there was not booked during even I was this time it was not a book but form came into being way like in the fifteen hundred thirteen fourteen fifteen hundred book like this right because even Paul Paul read the Old Testament scroll when it is rolled this is the scroll bad example but but most of the time it was so big though at to roll when we can then roll it together seal it unseal it unfold it and read it but there was no ready to read what with inequality phobic you can't read you know there's nothing to read you can't read you can't make out anything but once the book is open and unsealed you can read it all right and what God's been trying to do though he's been trying to unseal it and man that's tried to steal it back up like I said about the mouth guards been trying to open the Bible since Genesis the revelation of the Bible but every time God gives a revelation it looks like man takes close to the book back up alright but there had to come a group of people like we were talking about last night Bible study like Louie said there's a time that you know back in the early 1900's there was no thought of an astronaut going up in the outer space that was just you can't even get off the ground you know the Wright brothers came and flew a couple of hundred feet you know and then the airplane came into being but no way could you bow them putting a man on the moon they did it you know and then in the 60s they'd about what they did they developed a way to go then come back all right so now since we're now in the astronaut age we ought to be able to see into the beyond we ought to be able to open the book right right but there's only one person that's really worthy will read it a little pile of Revelations five there's one word you go lamb but now if you're born again someday where is that loud as he is heaven is that lambo we under somewhat know the lamb is here when I accept Jesus glasses my sacred the lamb came to redeem me and live in my soul all right okay so as he did that then the lamb is here then revealing the mysteries of God all right tell me all that came into anybody borrow sister Cletus we got to find her seventy weeks of Daniel book didn't even borrow under you have one thing Joe then even one day we have one year give them get I keep having a stack those shoots you ask about it it's kind of my fault that they got gone I guess I got to keep on watch ghost evoking anyway we'll talk about the scroll so the scroll was rolled up alright and seal it had to be unsealed so that we could read what would then know like i said before you can physically read this Bible and it's only just the stories it is a good story book its history is a good history book it's a good story book and it really tells you how to live life and actually I constitution which tomorrow would you lie before our Constitution was written according to the bottle we hold these truths be self-evident that all men are created equal and all those things in and all of our laws of the land was shadows I said used to now used to shadow of the bottle the head that they took it out of the Bible right I took it out of the Bible to write our loss for us to live by but there's a deeper meaning to this man has just unfold it to a place where they can physically read it's like we we pray and we sing open the eyes of my heart Lord I want to see you now today and from now on I want when you see that word seed could understand because basically you can read that Bible every day you laugh and dying help you can see what's written in that bottle but if you understand what's in the Bible you understand what's written there and some man must teach you will read it here even eyes that some men must teach you you can't get it for yourself you cannot get it by yourself you're not a prophet okay you can't get it by yourself so you have to depend on a possible profit pastors teachers in the bank with for the perfecting of the same alright so when we talk about the seven seals it is a mystery it's been hid from centuries and ages and no man on that and there there's no person in the grave today except William Brown that knew what those fields were right right think about that there's no person since the beginning of time except Jesus Christ that he is the seal do we have to take him you know take him out of the picture he's he's not up he's not in the grave he's with he's out he broke that seal and came out of the grade and he broke that Roman seal that they put on the up on the grave and that's what they uh they used to do if you watch that new movie and I think you should risen where it takes and they put a piece of wax on them on the rock they steal it up they steal this up with a band and they take a piece of wax and the old-time take a piece of hot wax our paraffin and they would drip it on there then they would take a Cygnet or a ring and they would imprint that we you didn't open it until he got to its destination ok and that's what God's done to us by the Holy Ghost he has sealed us could his seen that on it but now if he sealed us then who does the book we are the book God didn't see us and then sell us out of the book no he sealed us because we are the book you better find yourself in the Bible you better find yourself in there well my name's not in there yeah it's written all in if you'll read it and see I understand what it's talking about how the Bible's written a Christian alright alright so now let's look at Isaiah 29 and see what they talk about sealed we keep going down through here we're going to get into Ephesians and I want you to understand and remember this is probably one of the most simple understandings if you really see of the body brother branham preach dot is simplicity first to help you to understand that even the most illiterate person that can't even read can listen and hear what the Spirit says to the church what the Bible says we got to hear what the Spirit says to the church and hearing what the Spirit says to the church then you get all the written part plus the unwritten part because remember we're supposed to read where between the lines for those of you that are new I know my wife because we've been man for 37 years coming up right she can write me a letter and I know if a something wrong brother Danny just by the way she writes that letter you would too because you know these characters risking of your wife will see God wrote us a lot of letter so we're supposed to look between the lines and see the park you know she says everything's fine i'm doing well but right in between there I know she's sitting down she's missing me and we're you know we're missing each other come hey do you have a sister Cletus they can send at least book did you borrow again tomorrow one okay come on in now see if you can finally we're falta de sol everybody get what we're talking about a seal a seal shows a finished work alright but now let me explain something to you I asked this question in mobile Jesus died at Calvary right to take away all the sin of the world and when he rose he conquered death hell in the grave right broke the seal people feel God Christians I'm gonna talk about saturday i don't know about christians kept on dying why there was never enough of that man to come back until that jesus christ the headstone there was never enough word that that man took over in another dimension he sent back the Holy Ghost to what to seal man we're going to read it Ephesian breathing out of the Spirit of God read not the horse breeding I can't remember now where you are sealed see on so what God does he takes and seals you but what does he still he steals your revelation your new birth is a revelation I'm telling you more than ever in studying these dimensions and all you do not get a revelation in this dimension this dimension is is negative everything in this dimension should have never happened hello everything in this dimension LifeLight matter should have never happened we should have been in that seventh dimension there should have been no fall you understand but there had to be because God is a savior he's a healer he had to manifest those attributes but what are we going back to one dimension heaven on earth not heaven up yonder some way if we get a real revelation that means that that revelation came from somewhere in another dimension faster than this one into this dimension and that's God people because the only God can give a revelation same can give you an understanding but he cannot give you a revelation a man so God has to come down even through the fourth dimension God has to come through that dimension ah yeah you listen to tapes don't you you look at sermons on the internet it's on wireless words that come from fourth dimension right but there's a lot of bad things in the fourth dimension to but God comes through that dimension cuz he can't come in this dimension personally right now they mad but he can send messengers into this dimension to give us an understanding he brought the Holy Ghost when the Holy Ghost fell into that Pentecost it came from another dimension another world a supernatural world it was super it came from super doubted natural so it became supernatural it came down and filled the people with the Holy Ghost and made him supernatural beings but they died they were killed they all ones that ran the upper room almost were all murdered or murdered except for John the Revelator so he could write in the book of Revelation so the seal seals you there's only one seal but it takes seven seals to complete the plan of redemption and what we were talking about you say why it takes six but it takes that Sabbath to seal it all together because Jesus Christ is that seal right remember we've come a day and seventy weeks six seals finishes Redemption 6-volt purpose finishes Israel's Redemption so six the six seals finishes the redemption of the bride and then we move over into that seventh dimension where Christ can come back here the only reason he'd come back here is because we bring that dimension here we break the barrier down okay all right we'll get into that week on my dimensions later on in another sermon but let's read out there and the vision of all it will talk about vision now where do you get a vision the title of my sermon is going to be television television television television because jesus said to over when it come down the mountain see what tell the vision dunno land til the Sun I'm a beer in hand soap television television is telling you that God is working in another dimension Colette pictures coming through this room right now but brother Brown said your body is not able to pick it up because it's receptor but if you put a television right here trying to know with one of little ears and pick up on everything is going through this room so the vision of all is for coming to you as the words of a book that is sealed no understanding because remember you can't read a book when it's sealed the only way you can read a book that sealed this be the book and then be the book because from the outside it's sealed everybody all right that's why this is going to be this is a secret and only certain ones will get that part when they become the book which men deliver to one that is learn saying read this I pray thee and he said I cannot for his steel down through the ages that's what man has done man has come and sit what does this mean well we don't know but what does this mean what we don't know what does this mean we don't know hardly give their own interpretation we didn't come from this in the beginning right that's just my father son Holy Ghost baptism sure it's written around here Matthew 2819 going to all the world preach the gospel baptizing name of the Father name of the son named logos that's about the father is no name subs not named Holy Ghost is not named ten days later was was Peter so confused that ten days later he stood up on a bedpan coughs an act to 32 38 said repent be baptized name Jesus Christ now that is a name and the Bible says all heaven has a name Jesus Christ isolation but now remember we had to have that open to us because remember that was sealed in the denominational world where ninety-nine percent of the denomination believe in father son Holy Ghost is to baptism now brother after that come from the pits of hell why so false doctrine it comes from the fourth dimension to but it came from a demon it didn't come from God right that's pretty hard to understand the father son Holy Ghost being the baptism in that title is false so it is anything false is the devil if you don't have you don't have degrees of falseness in God all right he's all true everything else is a lot okay so and the business of all coming to use the word a book that is seal which men delivered to one they just weren't saying read this I prayed the end he says I count for his seal and the book is delivered to him that is not learn saying read this operated princes no learn or for the Lord said for as much as this people draw near me with their mouth and with the lips do honor me but have removed their heart that's the other thing so they removed their heart what the inner being that's where God wants to talk to you listen this thing can fool you but when you get down into that soul they see the faith or doubt there's no gray area in there right let's say about water baptism if it's revealed to you there's no other way you can be better the other one is false you can't have true and false together all right these people draw near me with their mouth and with a lift you honor me but have removed their heart far from me now where does God give you a revelation in your brain never it has to go through your brain to process it because you're human right to process it it has to go through your brain but it has to drop down into that not this heart like that says the thumping is it okay the heart your very core your real beating where you do all your real thinking the man because you know you got thoughts running through your head but when God brings a revelation if you're a Christian with dub range revelation you know where that came from because the devil can't bring your revelation and then but how to remove their heart far from me see God looks it to heart remember Satan took the intelligence God took the heart of man and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men right there for me hold i will proceed to do a marvelous work among these people even a marvelous work in a wonder for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish and the understanding of their prudent man shall be hid I'm you keep on reading but let's go to I want to go a golden thread now brother Bob red and Jeremiah remember here Jeremiah let's just look around here real quick Jeremiah put the evidence and sealed it and he what'd he do he sealed it and where he put it and on earthen vessel now this is a literal story the Dead Sea scrolls were found in a in a earthen vessel they were finding the cat found in the cave in a pot they were speaking down in a pot just like this that Jeremiah talking about stealing and putting what did Jeremiah do like brother Bob said the other day a deed Jeremiah had indeed this property he knew he was going in captivity maybe we showed that damn 70 weeks now 70 years and the land wrestle God put them in captivity for 70 years right that's he seventy weeks of Daniel but when they come back out even though if Jeremiah died or whatever he knew and somebody knew that that deed what is this this is indeed this is your will this is the will of God right you have you will read every day you read your wheel every day and you see what God's going to give you sorry but so Jeremiah physically took the deeds of the property this is the physical story just disease of a property just like you and I would and we would go put them in the bank so okay something happened somebody would know they go to your deposit box take them out see this is updated 2016 bird but the about 2,000 BC this is their version they seal it up if I could read it with them and they put it in an earthen vessel what a pot put a lid on now update it to now well what's what's he talking about you're going to take the evidence of the purchase put it in an earthen vessel seal it put it in an earthen vessel this is the earthen vessel now you know as well as I do many times I've told you but God when we see the word when the word talk about Earth I don't think about the big ball that we're on right you are earth this is your this is where you came from you came from my desert so this is the earth gods talking about not so much the big ball that we're living them all right then jeremiah said man shall I feel for my answers God Evanescence Elam what he's talking about is when they come back out of captivity they can go and break open that right and say hey I own that property this is mine that's the same way God's doing the same thing if he steals your evidence up listen in earthen vessel anytime the devil comes all you gotta do is go this is my property it's not yours you don't have a title I have a title this is my title alright that same way what you're mine brother Bob did a real good job with that deal done hey man okay right then in the Book of Daniel will just read through these real quick and get down to the New Testament but the old Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end we told Daniel masiela once you rope and it will be understood at the time of the end well guess what this is the end so God is speaking of the people sitting in this room right now and then alright so now let's go right here now what did what did we're coming into the New Testament now so we know now that the New Testament the seal of the New Testaments what the baptism of the Holy go what happened right here now Romans 4 who's he talking about Abraham Abraham received the promise but they were have got a evidence of the promise what a sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised now listen we're all adults here Abraham was ninth well you'll understand for them Abraham was 99 years old he circumcised himself he must have believed something do you understand he physically circumcised themselves at 99 years old so that's that you say well that's carnal well that's the face he had god told him i'm going to give you a sign of circumcision you cut off the foreskin of you remember and that's going to be my sign to you or what is that a sign that's a sign of getting rid of this excess flesh that we have a man that all right you have to be a little carnal but the Bible mcneil gives us allegories that we have to go back but it was what it was a sale God sealed Abraham's faith with that circumcision and the Jews to this day to this day the Jews take that as a sign of Ben jus if you're uncircumcised remember remember if you was uncircumcised you couldn't even go into the temple you had to show yourself to the priest every time you walked in the temple because remember what he called the Paul brought Timothy or somebody into the temple and he was uncircumcised and they found out he was uncertain something that got all over him call or Peter one of the two or the call I think it was Paul Paul brings Timothy in and they start bickering back and forth when Paul comes up says look it's not circumcision and uncircumcision now as part of the flesh but it's the circumcision of the heart so you see how that revelation came from natural to announce a supernatural revelation the supernatural revelation is now is the circumcision of the heart not the circumcision of the flesh part of your body they have nothing to do with it nobody will remember it did at one time yeah we just rented it did it one time Abraham thought had so much faith in God he said I'm gonna do everything thought tells me today right so God honored that faith and he comes over into a place to seal of his the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised so he's uncircumcised then come under the circumcision and God honored that as a type of the hodo right all right then we going down a little bit further the left we got to get to Ephesians sometime today you can see second Corinthians 122 who has also sealed us and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts so now what is God talking about now what's Paul talking about Krakens this thing the new birth so the new birth is the seal that's why I'm brothers and sisters I want to really be going to be playing if you can't understand the Word of God you need the new birth because guns will honor that new birth by giving you a revelation sure there's going to be things that we can't understand alright there's going to be things that we just can't get that's why there's teachers and that's one of those preachers and that's why there's pastors and that's why there's a badge list and all these ones to come in to what all they do is is they give you a channel to work in cuz I can't give you a revelation but if God will come from that other dimension come into my brain my humor brain you say what you wanted in this human brain of mine some of you were shaking your head but if God comes into this human brain of mine with a real revelation and it's something that I can a conduit that I can get it to the people then that's God talking to you straight from the throne straight from that other dimension now if I bring my own idea I have took something in this filter and brought it down and interjected my own idea right right and that's false that's me and you know what if you're a born again Christian you can't see bit see you can't understand that it's my brother male said it's hard to preach the truth it's not hard to preach error they just preaching man just let her go let her rip you know but the breach the truth that I know what he's talking about because you gotta go there's so many avenues you gotta cover brother nails very good at it some creatures will just preach what they believe in boy just you know take the bulldozer and push push to treat it out of the way you know her brother Dale he go comes back and studies and he says okay can we save that tree can we move that bush you know what he's saying is he's taking all avenues because there is going to be there is once you preach the message there's always going to be doubt and fear and somebody else's done stay with what about right come on you do the same thing well what about this well I think if the Holy Spirit's here you'll answer every one of those avenues ready say and not saying anything against any other preacher but some don't clarify what they're saying that's why you need a pastor a pastor clarifies he has enough time to clarify you know you have you have somebody like brother Joel comes in and he put on my he lays and whole bucket on him and he leave we'll see it takes brother Dale them to come back around the Spirit of God working through all the ministry and not the jeweler appreciate saying wrong but I don't believe he ever has but he may mention something and then back off and go somewhere else we'll see that's an evangelist evangelist to me kind of stirs you up okay I guess to think and get you to you know thinking what's going on then it takes somebody like a pastor to come and serve the meal you know I can tell you about a good meal but if you ever have a servant to me i don't know if it's good or not but you serve it to me and i start eating it then that's the way it should be so now look he's sealed us and give us the earnest of the Spirit in her heart now let's get to Ephesian vision one that's where we want to get to we okay woke the little all right and whom ye also trusted after that you heard a word of truth so you've got to hear first faith cometh by and hearing by work so faith come you can't have faith in something you don't know about at least a little bit you may not have to have a total understanding but you got at least Abraham listen Abraham's walking through the world and he hears this voice that says get up and move Abraham's probably got a nice house he's got a good job he's living with his father in law you know knees or his father and he's making idols and he's making pretty good money you know he's paying his bill got a good car maybe up to and he's sitting there you know and this is cousin lots with him and there's a nephew lots with him and he's everything's fine one night this voice just says Abraham get up move your move so it goes in and tell sister Jim Jim we're moving tonight of course you have to duck frying pans coming when you say that so y'all kind of dug and Sarah was not a meat woman idol thing at the beginning you know so the one thing is we do have to believe something that we can't all the way see but you got to have an understanding Abraham Abraham had an understanding that that came from somewhere not natural that was a supernatural voice that spoke to him why you saying all this will listen to get them to get the full meaning of anything seals down 70 weeks whatever you must have faith and believe in what God's telling you take it back to the word take it back to the mirror if it fits into work that's why I said about Dinah 70 weeks we made it fit in the word if it fits in the word I don't care what anybody saying prophet priest our King all right I really don't because I put it in the Bible the Bible tells us I love what brother Ron said face final resting place is in the Word of God run not what anybody says out here because you can take the quote that brother Brent I'm sitting here and you can make it sound like you said this you make it sound like this you say how you know that how many different denominations we've gotten this message people saying brother BAM preach polygamy and preach this a preset fall he never preached that the Holy Ghost never will preach air never all right but just like Jesus you know big I don't know if you think about this real but how about if them if it broke down walked up today and said I eat my flesh and drink my blood or I'll have no part with you or you have no part with me and then you walked off the pulpit that's what Jesus did he stood up in front of a crowd and he said unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part with me and he never explained it he left remember they started murmuring and complaining in one of the world and what's going on would you know what he meant he waited to a Paul came over a little bit later the Holy Ghost in Paul says look eat my flesh communion drink my blood wine symbolic right so that's the way that brother branham I believe he hit to hide it from the wise and prudent he said some things they'll hard to understand but there's no confusion in the true Word of God no new heroes look at whom also you trusted after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation and him also after that you believe after that you believe not before after that you believe you were sealed because what births you the word is what gives you a bird so you must hold on to a part of the word that you've got and seal it in here once remember once you're sealed in your soul Satan can't get in sure he can beat at the door he cannot but he cannot get that seal off of it you know why he has no authority to take that seat see he has authority on this that's when he disputed last night we're talking about Moses you go over the book of Jude Satan is disputing with Michael about where they hid the body of Moses why because Satan has one thing this was born in sin and he has a little bit of a hold on it because we came the way that he interpreted to Eve and the gardening now we all come by say so this is one thing that the Satan has he has hey he beats this thing to death huh I don't know if he beats you but he beats me okay you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession now the purchased possession is what this Jesus at Calvary purchased everything but remember it can't be applied unless we what we gotta believe like rosedale's preaching now week in room who brains all that stand up that we did in our life god I like that song what sins are you talking about yeah you know you say God forgive me for you know doing that in 1985 and he's going I don't remember that right we can't let there's no way we can't keep asking God to forgive the same sin if you already forgive it to the first time not sure we know it say it knows it and say it makes you sure you don't forget it but God's already forgot that's where the seal come from this is what God is looking at not he's looking at this he's looking at that title deed right here the Inside Man which is the earnest of our inheritance well the Holy Ghost is just a nervous because it's working in your soul Holy Ghost is working in your body only through your body all right so this is not this one made by Holy Ghost that's why I said if we were coming the way we should have come this was what he would be made by the Holy go how was Jesus made house uses body made the Holy Ghost will overshadow thee that's what we should come to man you don't know how we come that's exactly which book come because that's what you think about power although the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory okay everybody got that so now just for a few minutes he's read this with everybody always go for different but it says grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption alright you're sealed unto the day of redemption what is the day of redemption the day we take about a change and this man will not be overcome this this man inside will overcome this man and will have a body like his large body goes what happened to him he was human flesh Jesus was human flesh and he overcame all that and now here's a glorified by they went with us right but remember one thing you can't grieve the Holy go don't tell me yes you can if you never done it before if you don't do you may know how to hold you can't grieve something yet God yeah I'll grieve them before have you ever grieve you ever done something wrong and you just feel so bad about it and then you then you really don't repent for a day or two and you feel like you give you just you felt you go bar you lord well words he had brother Brown said he'll go out on a limb not gonna go out of you what you gonna do he's gonna withdraw his spirit from you just enough for you to say daddy I need you back he's not gonna wave if you'll never leave your internet you know you can't get the Holy Ghost and then lose it God's not an Indian giver he's not going to give you the holy ghost in the illusion now there's a big difference in having an anointing you can have an anointing and lose that you can come back loop that and come back to live that right conflicts was annoying everybody put Jesus on crops and he's going to go to hell for it I son I would say you would all right there biochem Annette go now I like this one right here I'm going to read this one then we'll go what's this nevertheless this is Paul nevertheless the foundation of God's standeth sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are to me that nails it right thing the foundation of all Christianity is that God knows who you are where you're at huh but i watch and let everyone that namath the name of Christ depart from iniquity now we're going to talk about the first seal and talk about iniquity what is iniquity iniquity is knowing to do better or going to do right and you don't do it that's right okay that's iniquity and we are a product of iniquity even you to do better but she did she fall so she brought the program of the devil everybody all right with that alright one more and then we'll go we're going to go to revelations five right here then we're going to read this and then we'll go I want you to chew on this a little bit so on the right hand of him in the cell and throwing a book written within on the backside sealed with seven seals right all right now seal right now we come over
