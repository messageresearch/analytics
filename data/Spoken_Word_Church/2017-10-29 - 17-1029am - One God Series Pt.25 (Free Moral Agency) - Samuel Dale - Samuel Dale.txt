John one and then we'll go to Joshua 24 John 1 Joshua 24 we had a great time yesterday to the Fall Festival we had to have everything inside cause it was raining but that still made it everybody they had the game they had things all turned out real good and everything and we just appreciate everything that was done the people fixing you know and doing the things and in getting everything to where they could play the games and then those that were doing the games and do it in the cooking and the food and everything we appreciate everything it was great but is that a good time in - now remember there will be no Bible study this coming first Saturday because everybody's going to be gone waiting there's going to be gone - brother Tim hymns and a lot of people are going so we'll just not have that one this month on the Bible study so remember that the fellowship meeting will be the third Saturday that brother Tony's I think that's what about the 19th but any has a third Saturday and I also remember that the other announcements Terrence made them this morning get the announcements of when the Thanksgiving is coming when the Christmas parts coming and all of the things and we just decided that they're the Christmas will Christmas Eve will fall on the 24th which is on Sunday so we're going to have that week a Saturday night service on the 23rd all right so that will be on the 23rd of December the Saturday night service instead of having one on the Sunday because you know because everybody is going with their families and doing and everything like that so just remember that all right brother Joe and brother Richard and by the Bob and then we're going to be trying to put some of the decals that we've got you know for the cars if you want one and they're gonna try to start today at about 12:40 so if you go eat make some arrangements find out who's going to do what just contact these brothers and and try to get everything figured out putting the decals on the windows of the car you know all right - I think that what is it sister Nellie Calhoun is to be memorial service or the service tomorrow so remember that family pray that the Lord would be with each one if she was about 90 something in lived a good long life and God was good to her so everything you know and we just thank God for being able to know these and knowing some that we'll pass on and we'll get to meet them later on all right amen all right John 1 and Joshua 24 father we thank you for this day in your grace Lord and we thank you for the opportunity to be able to set aside a day and just take a little time Lord that we can just fellowship with you around your word we ask you to bless each one remember all of the sick among us you promised it so you said you send your word and heal us and deliver us from destruction so touch each one there's many many sicknesses - Anna called us sick this morning Lord and just be with each one have your way Lord that your Grace and love may be sufficient for ever need that we have as we read your word you come and speak to us about it and guide us all in Jesus name John 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and what without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men like Shina 'then darkness and the darkness comprehended it not nellis go to Joshua 24 and this is the time you know and it's kind of God reminding Israel of the things that they've done in all like that in showing and bringing forth Abraham I like verse 3 there of 24 said I took your father Abraham from the other side of the fluid that's a pretty good predestination and but anyhow let's go over about verse 12 and he's talking about the things that he done to the / Canaanites virgins I see Hittites and all like that and how he delivered the people and I said to Hornet before you which drove them out from before you even the two kings of the a mirage but not with thy sword nor with my boast he had done the whole thing yourself okay and I've given you a land for which he did not labor the cities which you build not and you dwell in them are the vineyards and the olive yards which you planted not do you eat now therefore fear of the Lord and serve Him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your father's served on the other side of the flood and then Egypt and serve you the Lord and if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord watch what he's saying now putting it plain to him choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your father's served that we're on the other side of the fluid are the gods of the Emirates and whose land you dwell with as for me in my house we will serve the Lord you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word all right now we spent quite a time there this past Wednesday in referencing to the fall and bringing down and trying to get a good under standing and remember our main thought was that so we look at the fall as trying to figure out what happened or what caused or what took place or whatever you know and we're always trying to figure things out but remember the main point was that God cannot create anything wrong it doesn't matter what now there's no way that God can create anything wrong so then you say well what he done he created Eve this way or that way are you making some kind of a defect and I was bringing out Wednesday are you making some kind of a something that would cause her to do wrong are you trying to make it that away you know are you trying to make some thing that God done to her see that's not the point because we found out it's not the point of what she was doing or whatever we'll get back to that because there's only one sin and that's unbelief the acts and the things that happen is the display of unbelief or an attribute all right see then it's not on that basis of trying to think about her being made some way so she could do this I told you over and over and I've had always have that the only thing that I see that Eve was created in any way was the fact of her to be a mother right her to be a mother that would put a desire into her heart to be a mother to you know how children to do things and there's nothing wrong with that it was placed in the animals to have children there's nothing wrong with that we'll see don't get it into our eyes I mean our spiritual life thinking that you know something was made different is what I've drove over and over and over to you see that something was made to purposely to do this alright then see we we've been we'll we'll go to those lines and we'll spend our time trying to study some form or thought and we come up with doctrines and ideas and you know how they doing the message all you got to do is throw out something and here they go and they start running and you know everybody's got this idea about it and that idea about it all I can't but just remember we're not trying to argue ideas nor thoughts and I have no problems with anybody trying to I have never tried to straighten anybody out see that's what a lot of preachers say boy I straightened them out I've never had that thought in my mind it's not in my mind's eye view never has been to try to straighten somebody else it's try to help try to do the best I can to help you to get you to see things the way God wants it not something to try to straighten you out because that way we just get to an arguing with each other and it's it's no good but to put it to a basis that we try our best and I don't believe rudder Branum you know was that away I remember him making a statement one time and and he said oh I wanted that so much and then he stopped or something like that and he said you know I shouldn't talk to him he was just honest he he wasn't trying to straighten out anything he was trying to tell the truth about God in His ways and that's all that I've ever tried to do to get you to see the real thing so then we know it for a certainty that God cannot create it and anything wrong there was nothing wrong with Adam and his creation and remember if you say Adam was created perfect now listen to the point if you say Adam was created perfect but he was created a little imperfect now remember then Adam wasn't perfect Oh because if Eve was an Adam the little imperfect you think trying to make out would make Adam not perfect so you understand what I'm saying I try to get things like that to where your mind will think instead of trying to house it you're brainy ideas and thoughts because we'll get more to it Wednesday night on the the points of reasoning factors and stuff like that and watch how that it'll come right down to where it is because remember the point I kept making whatever the original fallen condition whatever you want to talk about it being it's still here now the original sin whatever it was is still here now right and if that's true then she didn't why not just look around you know just look around where we're at and think about ourselves it would sure help to understand what took place in the garden see we look at the things like we throw off on the people for saying that Eve ate an apple or this that of the other we go off on them but see then we'll turn around and say well it was this it was that would you just remember whatever eating Apple would have been would have been an attribute of something whatever you want to call it over here back between the even the beasts that's an attribute that's not a sin you remember brother branham was preaching so much about you know this wasn't saying that once then that lady said pray tell what is sin he said it's unbelief because you cannot do anything wrong until you first turn down the Word of God all right so then it lays in the basis of sin that when Eve accepted Satan's lie and I wish you'd listen to that message over and over because my emphasis was how small a thing it was that she done you know we always want to look at some great big outlandish nothing it was so small and so close to the truth were they not told to multiply and replenish the earth did not the Prophet as we'll go back to it again today didn't he say that he Eve would have finally brought that child oh no that can't be because of this then what are you dealing with just remember you're dealing with Almighty God not human terminologies that's no good you're dealing with what God says about something and what a prophet says about it or else why believe a prophet if you're not gonna believe what he said what I just know that ain't got nothing to do with it you don't understand it that's the sin that was in the garden that he didn't understand it we'll get to that Wednesday morning she didn't understand it that's exactly the same thing for you to sit and say I don't understand it why not we've had 50 years since the passing of the prophet or at least how the intellectual part of our minds set in the category afterward God can use them right at least by now but see I kept emphasizing the point what Eve doubted brother Branham said when the message all things are possible him that believeth Eve doubted God's Word that was the original sin was to doubt God's Word now what's the difference in that today you come up to somebody you talk to him about God and things you know and then then you mentioned water baptism how do you argue about - oh we're baptized according to the Bible oh yes it says in Matthew 28:19 the baptized in the name of the Father the Son and of the Holy Ghost you say yeah but that's not what I'm saying that's your interpretation of what it's saying because it's saying Lord Jesus Christ what do we say there in there in unbelief right they don't believe the truth moving a little more into closer in the Word of God we might find out there's a whole lot of unbelief left within us right mmm just keep those thoughts we'll try to get some of that Winston but Eve doubted God's Word there was the original sin the profit on the pie the Queen of the South he says talking about sin being unbelief and he said really unbelief is the only sin the only sin there is is unbelief we see we look at it that's hard for us to to get in our minds to think about the unbelief being first we put it all together as one thing we make the act of the even the beast and the unbelieving to be one thing when it's not what she done with the beast was an attribute of the sin that had already entered within her and caused her to do it we play the emphasis the Prophet did on what they she doubted one word all right now what does he go on to emphasize a lot of times with that doubt of one word that if one word brought us out now what did he say he said how do we expect to go back with one word oh you believe you're straight you you don't have one word now the reason we're here is because we do at least have something wrong now let's don't blame God I'm Sonics I can be about that I don't know where it's at and if you'll tell me where it's at I'll ask God to forgive me of that sin of unbelief at that point but I do admit to the human part of it evidently something's wrong no but you know what most of our doing is you know this is true most of our doings and we're waiting on somebody else we're waiting with somebody else to get straight if we could just get these people to we just get the women astray if we can just get this we can just get back how's that true instead of looking at our own selves we remember one word of unbelief to Eve cause the fall what are we going back with any of our thoughts and ideas you see that's why I'm so hard as being you know if I am going to be the pastor I'm going to preach what I believe God's Word is to the closest that I know of it and do the best I can because I'm responsible do you realize that you could go in upon the basis of what I would be saying but I could have an unbelief and miss it and yet you take what is said and go in on it yeah but I don't have no one believe brother Dale what about it hmm do you see Eve never doubted God you remember that one Crescent mister God revealed she had faith in God she never doubted God she didn't say they wouldn't know God she believed in God she had faith in God was she doubted one time who get down to it what did run around and say really is he doubted you know what run around said what eased out was was to doubt Hebrews 13:8 he said that's where she was deceived that that's closed it ain't time for us to play and think about her ideas and and now here's the worst thing I'll emphasize this Wednesday because my thoughts here's the worst thing is to be sympathetic to be sympathetic with something is so close until it can take us and that's not realize it oh brother Shawn shows a good brother praise God Alcoholics Anonymous circuit well that's the way they believe praise God we don't have any right to believe right you see the point brother branham on the message queen of the south I'll tell you I'll give these because they're on the internet for them to use where they can do it brother Brennan said it's not a sin for immoral living well let go to the Beast and Eve wouldn't it right was not that immoral living within brother and said that's not sin he said that's an attribute he said the reason you do that he says because you don't believe right so it's not the act in the things that's a display of an unbelief all right now what happened to Eve let's get started on this we'll go ahead and give up brothers they're number five their notes and things and let's just think about some things now and then we're going to get down to a minute to to touch on a little point of free moral agents and try to understand that just a little bit but look what he says he's talking about that's how adults read in other words you know what happened that's how adultery is committed spiritually when you know better by the Word of God by the intercourse of the mind take in a lie of the devil against the Word of God and we're not talking about rape we're not talking about things that people do with drugs to get you we're talking about normal things normal things your prophet will explain it's got a first enter through the mind look alive the devil against the Word of God that's exactly what he's done with a spiritual intercourse first that come by believing Satan lie into the wound of her mind now what does he say that polluted her soul that death in the sold in the natural act implies there will express more in Wednesday some things of soul and spirit and nature and that's the only way that a woman ever can commit adultery against her husband is to first let some man talk her into it then receive another man that's not her husband then she's committed adultery yeah first it has to be in the mind your brain you're taking mechanism whatever you call it and it just keeps dropping downward into the parts of us until it becomes you know to where we live all right but it's got to be first in the mind so then before use Oh can I be plain now we know things happen in life because we're human being okay men women we're human beings and we've done things wrong okay so you want to know what the Prophet is saying dry I mean how do you sisters or to know what the Prophet says is right is that blood but not blurted out you ought to know that first thing had to enter through your mind whether it would be the first night of your wedding or whether it would be in life when you done wrong okay I'm sorry but a blunt is better way all right see it winners into your mind and then it goes from the human mind of sight see tail say taste feel smell hear you know it drops lower into your memory reason conscious sometimes and then it works on out into you but it's first it's got to be in your mind so it wasn't a five-minute a fire with even the beast she may have been talking remember I emphasize Sunday then it wasn't the devil up in a free holler down and talking is she talking to the Beast right but it was the devil to the Beast because the Beast remember was capable of talking he's the closest thing to the human being the only difference was he didn't have a soul all right so then being blind in blunt things first enter through into the mind and then it works out into other things let's see then that's where you make your choice now remember I will get to it probably this maybe Wednesday but remember these two thoughts about choice number one your choice is to believe God's Word you must make that choice number two is to believe Satan's choice about the word you choose to believe him so we'll get down to that see we get on to so much until we try to place it in the wrong way it's come down to a choice well brother Lu you you mean you believe that we have a choice I've always been told that we didn't have no choice I thought he chose us that's exactly right but you won't ride override your free moral agency you can choose you but he won't override it and make you take it so then you got a choice keep that in mind and don't lose it don't get so much we'll see you can say something bout a choice well he don't understand God chose us and it was settled before the world he chose us it was all over with I always was eternal well I don't I go along with what the Prophet said about the truth of being eternal yeah if you have eternal life the eternal life was eternal yeah I agree with that but I don't agree I we've got to leave it to where it's a free choice yeah but where while we were there in denominations we discussed about choices yeah what good is it choose what choices of what yeah my point is that we've argued all the way down about choice choices are very very essence of all there's no Christianity without choice it's like wait we're talking about Sunday you know saying if God just done it and never brought any sin involved or any devil coming we just be like zombies we wouldn't be making choices we wouldn't be people that we our choice is a wonderful thing we see we get it up but I don't I know where the prophets in it I know where the Bible said it they said we didn't choose him he chose us praise God we believe but just remember why did he choose you because he knew knew you would choose him am i right a simple Christianity and he knew you would choose him so then that was the choice before the world well I just don't have nothing to do with it free moral agency it's not for the bride you ever heard that one you ever heard the preachers preach on how that it's not a free moral agency it's all settled and done you don't have a free moral agency you're in that shape and remember free moral agency is what gives you a choice okay keep that thought before said but anytime a woman takes a wrong step she has to first receive it in her mind this is still often spoken word reading on CD so slicker has to precise weighed her when she listens to it against her own better judgment then the act is committed so first it hit seyton hit Eve's mind and in the wound of her mind she doubted God's Word then come the actual seed our is the original sin of unbelief we're not even into the literal acts or anything we're talking about first what happens it has to be a spiritual talk through your mind to go through the rest of you to bring your body into subjection yeah yeah I love this one I've quoted this quote of many a time but most people don't read the whole thing but around says Eve since but confused on one promise then he's the same yesterday today and forever so you know what that means is exactly what I said while ago whatever the original was whatever the first unbelief was it still comes down to you and me are facing the same thing this day remember what did he want wisdom what is the great thing today wisdom all we know more what is we talking about he was saying you know oh that beasts you just preach into it remember she just appreciated to him like everything cuz that's what she wanted to do and remember she is a woman Andrew member she is a type of Christ in the church so we should take that doubt to consideration whatever you original sinner thoughts are it will finally come to show up into the right across you can see how easily Satan can deceive the people of this endtime message if you don't think it's deceiving look at a lot of fun today going you Internet's and check everything 40 years or something somebody's priest floor by screen bite and everything in the book the prophets messages right didn't turn around and deny ever be that now that's what you call it deception right I mean they life and make fun of them and gonna call a name but one of the brothers it was with brother Branham that he called his name constantly we talked to brother you called his name in but we talked to this brother about this other brother and asked kind of what was he doing he said oh six months I had two brother around I said he went back to denominations well said we make light of that you know what would that something he stayed with the Prophet he seen all and died they need to go back to the denomination well what's the difference in going back to one and never coming out of them right you know denominations is ideas what about not never coming out of them but look I want to get this point right here see II stopped and didn't wait brother branham said it seems to presented to him with the versus faith she presented to satan and then she stopped to wait to see what he'd say she presented we could need a better tree with this one tree then she stopped to see what he would say it's always been to stop and wait right got a whole lot in here us where that was the problem one was she couldn't wait for God to fulfill his word what about us oh man I can well so remember when the 70s begin to hit and the people of this message then when it pi 77 boy that just went haywire it was dusts at the Lord it was coming got to be here got to be here and then after no I'm not doing no joke I'm telling the truth after it wound up in 77 pi style they saying brother runs message wouldn't nothing but the devil because he wouldn't ride come on church time we wake up alright what about it go ahead and pull it up number seven the god of this evil aid we're right around talks about that she was yeah but I want you to read all the way down you'll see the same sin is sitting right before you and I that was before Eve the reader we find now this evil age is to prove to Satan the bride is to prove to Satan what that she is not that type of a woman you know even all of the things in the world and situation denominations and she'll be tried by his word or you think we've been doing 50 years I glory in it myself I didn't want it to come this far but you know yourself its own record in 1974 I proved by brother branham's message and the Bible that we could pass the Year 2026 and not break the message the people don't want to hear like that oh it was all over in 77 yeah well I'm still here what are they doing I love it she will be tried by his word what a wonderful garden knows how to try his breath see the bride as Adams ride was tried by the word and that of his bride believed every bit of the word all but confused on one promise that he's the same yesterday today and forever in other words he would keep his word now watch the rest of the park just remember all she was but confused on one promise the Hebrews 13:8 was written back tire and get the point she was confused on the fact that God wouldn't keep his word that would make him Hebrews 13:8 right whatever he was he still is and always will be so listen to the partner Adams bride believed ever been in the word all but confused on one promise listen he's the same yesterday today and forever but failed on one promise then what was that promise what was that promise that she failed on I preached it Wednesday night over and over well what was the promise when random relates it to Hebrews 13:8 because it is what the word says the promise that he promised dire is the entire Bible tied together to show that he's the same yesterday today and forever she didn't doubt Hebrews 13:8 it wasn't written she doubted the promise what was the problem come on he's the same yesterday then too but failed on one promise under the temptation of enemy face-to-face and now the people that's called for his name of course is his bride she used to come into contact again by the same thing one promise what is the promise not by just denominational truth or something whatever word thank God we're gonna be tried by every word now if you believe when I was preaching a few weeks ago the fact that God which would be better for God to a done let us come without any problems any trouble to anything he would have been our Father cause he would have created us he could have give us eternal life we would have been his children but that wouldn't his plan and purpose would remember you know what his plan and purpose was a promise that he made he made a promise to Adam and Eve what was that promise yeah just a simple question if I said a brother down for deep we don't understand him we can't follow him Cody said of this and he said that we said we can't understand I just asking a simple question what was the promise that God made to Adam and Eve he made that promise before the foul what did he promise them according to Genesis 1:26 and 27 and 28 you City the story we dwell on 1:26 and 27 because of it being the creation right of who the one seed which is Christ according Galatians 3:16 because not many seeds was promised but what is chapter 28 I mean verse 28 say multiply and replenish the earth now brother Branham say it go in spoke a word original seed and listen he said if that had been kept they would have never been a problem you see I put a lot of emphasis on it Wednesday but I'm wondering did you follow it did you follow it the salt go ahead number eight taken from wisdom versus faith he said soak like the seed word cannot grow in the atmosphere of under knowledge and things right he can't grow under that and as soon as knowledge mixes with faith it dies right there not knowledge faith ok Eve come and said the Lord said the day we eat thereof that day we die then she stopped to see what he would say to the Beast he said but listen my dear you lovely little thing she surely God made you for a purpose you know he knew about multiply and replenish the earth right Satan knew about that come on you were made for this purpose that's what it is you don't know it now but you were made for this purpose oh you're a lovely little thing dear look look at those dainty little hands you know what I think about that I think about that one we're brother Reynolds saying to that girl see why do you like that boy said he ain't nothing but a scoundrel don't believe the word said why do you got she said Oh said he's got the prettiest little feet and said he smells so good you don't see what the fall was from a lot of silly stupid things yeah I'll say it again remember where you come from remember where you sold your virginity you're a lovely little thing but he said if we if we did we die now that's not him say it but he said they should have paragraph to stop that but he said if we if we did we die she said she said that did we die me I don't have no education but I got sense he said but old you think that's a good think that a good loving father God would do a thing like that what'd she do she listened to reason took his wisdom said it's a tree delight one can be desired of it and she fell for it that's exactly when she did what happened like it would to any woman as soon as you fall for it it's finished right there you don't have to go remember remember the scripture the Bible does not say in the Old Testament it said if you committed adultery goes wrong right that's the Old Testament but what's the New Testament say if you look on the woman to lust after in your heart what does it say you've done you've already committed adultery no that's what he's saying once it's accepted once Eve accepted that and said that does look good that was it right there that's all it took I was made for that purpose and I have this motherly instinct about me of wanting children and looking at the animals and they have children they have offspring but we don't have any that's all it took the act was an attribute because he said it's finished and watch it now you see the seed that she was holding now I didn't write the book I just read you see the seed that she was holding and would have finally become a mother watch by the will of God to a spoken word she would have a cold mother she was holding to see white seed you get over to Genesis what 3:15 I'll put in in between you guys see the seed of the woman the promise of the coming of Jesus Christ well I don't see I Eve could have produced Christ well we didn't need it anyway because he'd be the savior even see you got it all of your philosophies your ideas but you don't listen to the word she would have finally become a mother which you couldn't wait went him today what was the promise that we read up there then we emphasized that she failed on the promise god of this evil ain't confused of what promise she was confused on the basis of what God said multiply and replenish was not that what the beast explained to her as he was made far are you in me he explained that's what she would fight for you know what that's what she's might but according to brother branham she didn't wait what would have finally become a mother by the will of God to a spoken word okay she didn't you and I would have come forth I did not been aforesaid we know that was a fall that's your philosophy sir okay look at the next one let's go to number nine spoke words of reading those seat Ronna Christ was the top of the second Adams bride bride of Adam was the top of the second Adams bride I'm it's a bride Paul Adams bride could not wait God had told Adam and Eve multiply and replenish the earth it was an oncoming thing a promise you said you're just preaching over what you preach twinsies exactly and I'll do it this coming Wednesday if it takes it no problems just facts where were they gonna multiply and replenish what were they to be we've been through that we've covered that that were to bring forth the human race through the spoken word of the mankind that would have been the Genesis people but by the fall in the way that it came we are under the same thing the Bride of Christ is to multiply and replenish the earth not physically but by that's one seed which is Christ still got the same promise still in the same promise was he listening Wednesday what Adams bride could not wait God had told Adam and Eve multiply and replenish their it was an oncoming thing I promise she was not his wife as yet because they've never lived with her was a promise a promise it was an own coming promise now you in the garden this evil age you'll read that again twice in that one quote brother round talks about the promise what was the promise I kept asking the problem what was the promise the promise was that he was that they was gonna multiply and replenish the air would cien entered the picture they couldn't do it anyway it he's not told them physically dropping now to do it come on he's only told them in the spiritual but it's told Noah after the flood come on read your Bible I'll give it to you the other day he's in Genesis knowing the flood read it he's told Noah now multiply and replenish the earth physically and brother branham may I state him remember what he said he said then what reproduced the earth in Noah he said to see to the serpent it was the physical reproduction lissa going on the father's spoken words reading those seed number 10 if Eve would have have brought forth that child right warned of water-borne to the spirit and John the spoken word again will pull it back down cuz that's a beautiful statement Lord back down where we can read the top part Oh remember what y'all do with it I don't know what you worked all of God's sons must be the same yes sir to be born of the word of spirit I love that one we're gonna get that statement over and over and over when we get in bring it in the kingdom of God go listen you'll be bored of the word the Spirit brings us back to the spoken word again like in John 3 to be born to the water to spirit what does it do then it brings you right back again unto the place where you should have been at the beginning that's wonderful see that's the reason to Christ death to bring us right back again to were sons of God if he would have have brought forth that child she would have finally done it did not God tell her multiply and replenish there but I don't believe that classy there's your unbelief we're reading where's your unbelief what's the next one where to number 11 still out of spoken words a regional seat they notice what happened in these children the first one that was born now God said multiply to his bride patterns bright and replenished multiply and replenish the earth that was God's commission there's the promise and she would have done it and he would mixing themselves together you see what he's saying well what happened when Adam got ready to come to his bride were already a mother God commissioned Adam and Eve to multiply and replenish the earth they would have brought it by as we just read another spoken word no problems right listen come on when God give a commission which cannot perish God's Word is eternal it cannot fail he said multiply and replenish the earth that was God's eternal purpose now listen to carry that out you cannot die because it's his word you have to live if that child been brought forth right there have been no death but she couldn't wait what was the promise Adam and Eve multiply replenish the earth bring forth the Christ but you don't need to Christ leanness see that's quicks mine there he goes your mind it's done gone and you didn't took Satan's idea we don't we'll need craft I would back up and follow you he might argue about the flesh of Jesus but remember Christ was the child then Adam and Eve was to bring I won't Christ don't you so you see how easy it is to be in doubt the same as Eve the Christ child there'd be no problem with the Christ child coming without sin there's no problem with the flash coming without seeing you know fan even though saying I went at a proper no crime yeah we don't need it see the arsy keep clicking buttons up right in that brain you know what we don't need it you don't want it you realize what I'm saying had they been no fall and there'd been no situation would we still wanted to just look up and and see God as father and time would you not want him to come down and dwell among you in flesh with you if you were in flesh you seaters we think we got it all figured out yeah and what was the rest that we kept talking about the only reason our only difference in the way he was made than any other of the other animal kingdom she was made to be a mother so whatever animal made to be a mother the only difference now forgive me for being blunt the only difference was in the animal kingdom it was only far and I'm quoting brother branham reproduction it would only been once a year or whatever for the puppies the woman wouldn't made that way you can call that a defect I don't I called it her god-given right to keep that free moral agency and stay with God's Word and not take Satan's lie to try to figure it out and to wait for God well you think we've been here 50 years waiting on God he said well he been ready oh so was it was Moses okay Moses got ready went down to Egypt he didn't work out too good he went back to the wilderness and stayed 40 years the waiting's on the people not waiting on God waiting on you and I to get out of our stupidity in human elements and to believe what God says without trying to reason it out just give me just a minute you realized then man has been put on a set wheel you can pull it up if you want to number 14 go jump over man's been put on a set wheel according to revelations chapter 4 why will you call that set wheel let her random because it puts a man and a woman back again like Adam and Eve at the Garden of Eden yeah we don't want no set wheel what I said well go oh no we ain't got self well we he chose me did you choose you over yourself we'll all right the two trees set wheel this one is death this one is life self will the moral free moral agency God placed the first man Adam and Eve right down on free moral agency he places you the same place and the only way that you can get this thing fixed in here is your own self wheel hallelujah yourself will you have to wheel to do God's will I didn't write the book you read it off the page you have to get rid of your own wheel then let God's will come in for this is the only channel that leads to the heart and one-seventh leads to the hardest that wheel will get to that wind esteem okay come on the breech Adam fell to death he brought death upon creation he was given free moral agency was given to them just as we show to make a choice now Adam and Eve in the beginning there was a tree of right and wrong before them and that same tree sets before each and every one of us God is doing two for Adam and er4 even or would he see not changing it he said well he's their father no not now it isn't it's your fault you can't place you don't have them now you've got to place it on yourselves because right and wrong is set before you you're on the frame basis in Adam and Eve sev will free moral agency let's write it down I heard brother choice oh man he preached serve another sermon about that God chose us brother Dale's preach sermon after sermon about God's using us this is not changing it because I never had any idea there that he chose me above what you have to make a choice choose you this day whom you serve let's see we've got it all figured out with the great revelations he shows us we didn't how to do it we had eternal life or door Oh ain't inglorious we just come down to this world and we just we've just had to we've done this and we went out into the sin oh and we went out into adultery and we went out into all of these drinking's and yeah yeah where's the eternal inside oh that's funny come on if you come in the world with eternal life then what was the things of us doing wrong come on get it off what's the things that you're not doing wrong if we come into the world with eternal life that would put an eternal God into a filthy Center and that will not work that's the worst unbelief that there is a priest in about three months ago the worst unbelief is what for you to sit down and think you're right just because of your thinking that's the worst thing anybody could ever have free moral agency go ahead and number 15 what a wheel did we read that it says okay no 16 go into 16 a paradox you're on the same basis as Adam and Eve was if God puts you on anything else it would be unjust to Adam and Eve that solve it each Adam and Eve tonight has gotten to right and wrong sitting before him you can make your choice you can take God's Word or leave God's Word you can take God's Word or your denomination or Creed's about it you can take your modernistic ideas of what it is you can be born again and filled with the Holy Ghost or you can be Church eyes that's a good word either one you won't to church eyes I never heard that one it's a new word that's not in webstore don't get seventeen the power of transformation wonder number seventeen we gotta hold up someone this he just let him out there on free moral agency to let him act he couldn't make them do it and still be just me somewhat Adam and Eve right he's how much you and me but he's telling that Adam and Eve he just put him out there on the free moral agency look now you want to read something he just let him out their own free moral agency to let them act he couldn't make them do it and still be just but he could put them equal with him oh what's he mean equal with him Adam and Eve wouldn't equal with God God was the god of glory they would be the god of the earth even they're ruling the human person you and I are not equals with God on the basis of being that way it's guarding us that makes us what we are but you don't want God had a choice he had a free moral agency we have a free moral agency read it he could put them equal with him so thereby we know who they were created perfect nothing wrong look and free moral agency and then let them do it themselves and he knew they would do it so then you see then when Adams live with she brought four twins and one of them was of Satan the other one of them was of Adam which was of God Cain and Abel gave them a free moral agency let's get one more 18 God's gift always find their place that's the reason that God does nothing outside of a man he always works through a man because he had to use a man a man is what he had to use to display his attribute a savior he had to make him in His image and make him something like him and put him on free moral agency and let him act any way he wanted to he could take his choice and he knew that man by giving him this choice would fall so being that he had to do he had to do that he turns back around and makes the man a partner to him and does nothing except he does it through a man the whole work of redemption come by man hallelujah death come by the first man life come by the second man see there you are he does nothing because he had to use a man for that then he uses a man redeemed by Christ had to come into being a man a mortal man the ability in flesh to die in flesh to die to pay the price but are you listening what was the promise God made it Eve dat it multiply and replenish the earth which was a spoken word being original word of God had she brought it forth correctly who would have come out right but giving them free moral agency brother Brennan said he knew they would fall but does that mean he made them fall no because there's for your problem I said it a minute ago you still got it in your mind choice deals with two things you can choose God and live or Satan and die the choice is yours you have no choice Allah word eternal you got a choice to believe that I have a choice not to believe it in the way you're trying to express it choose you this day whom you serve for me in my house will just keep right on going just keep right on going fifty years hasn't been no problem I'm 77 I don't want 50 more that would kind of running things out a lot no we don't want to go that way but I ain't gonna argue with him I didn't want it to come this far when I said it but I stood in this pulpit and said it in 74 that we could go to 2026 nobody wants to know why I said dad we get everybody else has got their predictions of this and it was supposed to be 77 it was supposed to be 73 and a high of his both the 80s as opposed to me I said it because of a promise who was in God's Word that I'll not leave you comfortless I'll come to you the bride is to prove to Satan she's going to be tried I was worried reading it go to this evil age we're even she's to prove to Satan that she won't fall what if he gives us another fifty year again but you see when you make statements outlandish things people don't remember and they don't want to I had no references and whatsoever of D Christianizing anybody in any form I told what God told me I said the biggest portion of people of this message will die and go by the grave because they won't be able to take the change now I said that 40 years ago no references to nobody god I may be the next one time runs on I will be one of them that will go to the grave i had no references to their christianity because you see the reference i had when you reach your position listen real careful when you reach your position in Christ why is they some here this 90 and some were forties or fifties you know when you reach the place in Christ the day Martin Luther preached the message that just shall live by faith his destiny was set to go to the grave because there would be no change preached during that age It didn t Christianized him did it it said him the way God wanted him he brought a message that we still believe today not decreasing isin nobody today may be a way ahead of us waiting on us to catch up to where they are yet people that want that they get the feelings hurt me thank you throwing off on somebody what if I'm the next one get right up behind the pulpit waiter who does a funeral get a better sight well daddy said it now he's one of them that's gone home so he's waiting on us no let's tan come on musician free moral agency which is a right to choose and God will not override your free moral agency he ain't gonna make you saved and you don't want to be saved it gives us a choice and that choice lays before everyone of us I hope he caught what it's all about the promise I tried wins too but it didn't work the promise Eve would have finally brought that child we don't want to believe that what we all becaus who says that but he calls you out some idea this contrary to that right thought could that be our unbelief well we got breath okay you might have a name [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] don't wait something the other day coming up highway I said son I said my horse is not in the resurrection of the Prophet I said my hopes is not in the resurrection I said listen to me it's not in the resurrection of Jesus Christ that's already been done 2,000 years ago he readies are you trying to make him rise again I said my hope is not in the resurrection of Jesus Christ back down we've preached at 2,000 years of that resurrection but I thought your prophet said your resurrection lays inside of you in your spirit so where's my hope that in the resurrection the day of Jesus Christ that come from back there to give me a new birth here to let me rest in him now you misunderstand what I said on that and you'll think I'm throwing slangs in the mud no I'm telling the truth I don't look back I look forward I've been there walked in the place stood down prayed in the tomb that is empty my hopes he's not building that part because that's what's already happened my hopes is building whether or not Christ is living within me now because a God of yesterday is no good [Music] doesn't mean that's what's wrong while we've been here 50 years it's God's waiting on somebody to say it and say we're here in its present tense and a reality of crises in our hearts that's all I've ever preached is the resurrection of Jesus Christ coming from 2,000 years ago and bringing him to a reality into our hearts and lives right now to see Christ alive that's what it is why [Music] you dismiss this afternoon [Music] [Applause]
