[2:00] we'll start announcing it now so thank
[2:03] you all for helping everybody that came
[2:05] it makes for a little day sometimes but
[2:07] still it's worth it yeah it is worth it
[2:11] even even losing an hour of sleep last
[2:13] night it's still working
[2:22] don't bother I got up seven o'clock this
[2:25] morning I always get up to seven on
[2:26] sending I turned over and I'll look dark
[2:29] outside your body says and only sees the
[2:32] clock
[2:33] but now father Tom had to tell us to get
[2:36] up an hour early everything all right so
[2:39] now we've been through it I said thank
[2:41] everybody for for taking over Bob
[2:44] somebody's news next week Nick really
[2:49] because he's sleeping you get hit our
[2:54] back but March the 22nd we're gonna be
[3:00] in Oklahoma probably will get Lily to do
[3:09] do that Center place we're on The Book
[3:12] of Revelations and we're into the church
[3:13] ages we've done one two three and I'm
[3:17] gonna read for again and we're going
[3:19] still we're not gonna go in dive deep
[3:21] into into the Church ages because we
[3:24] know we read the church age book I've
[3:27] asked you to read the separate volumes
[3:29] when brother bang preached them so we
[3:31] ought to have a good idea kind of what's
[3:33] going on because we need to get on into
[3:35] Revelations we're now just in Revelation
[3:37] chapter 2 and there's 20-something
[3:39] chapters so we need to get in and we got
[3:41] to get into all the symbols and all
[3:43] those different things so March the 22nd
[3:52] it's not a way if you hey yeah you get
[3:57] in you're hours late back there
[4:01] okay when you get older you don't want
[4:05] to do that either
[4:07] so here we are in thought IRA now this
[4:10] is the one the fourth circuit if this
[4:13] murder burger was my attire so this is
[4:15] the fourth circuit which is considered
[4:18] the dark ages keep baby
[4:22] I come at the pink and into the Angel of
[4:31] the Church of the anti tire right all
[4:35] right let's get to it guys Tower which
[4:37] is the fourth decade these things st.
[4:39] the Sun God has his eyes like a flame of
[4:41] fire and his feet like unto fine brass
[4:44] now remember let's think about this the
[4:47] other day you take you you got to peer
[4:50] on a dull trading word coming in first
[4:52] two three one two three actually maybe
[4:55] not the curb so much but you got you not
[4:57] seeing counseling all these different
[4:59] things the word is really it's like
[5:02] brother Brown said it's just eroded down
[5:04] so much to where they've taken the hope
[5:08] the Father Son Holy Ghost baptism
[5:09] they've taken now there are Pope's in
[5:13] the place of preachers now there it's
[5:16] eroding so bad until God is going to
[5:20] pronounce judgment ice plan to fire his
[5:25] feet brass brass always in the Bible
[5:27] brass speaks of judgment okay all right
[5:31] so I know thy works and charity then we
[5:34] coming to this poor church age and
[5:36] remember like I said before Columba his
[5:39] life was not really in this church age
[5:42] he died before the church they started
[5:44] church age 30 and 606 I think he died
[5:47] like 605 somewhere in there but but his
[5:52] voice of his teachings what he was
[5:53] preaching cuz he was from Ireland he
[5:55] grew up not too far from brother path
[5:57] from for the brother George Queen lives
[6:02] and he was it and I'll tell you one
[6:05] thing you want to read about Columbus
[6:07] never in that we're going to start
[6:09] with a sage Columba brother Trevor even
[6:14] has done a YouTube video and he actually
[6:17] went to Ireland and retraced the steps
[6:19] of Columbus what would you put in on
[6:21] YouTube because I they sent me the link
[6:23] and well it's really interesting how
[6:32] that he shows where he landed the fort
[6:36] that he it was always told that Columba
[6:40] yes you can sit right up here hey girl
[6:42] hey baby
[6:45] funny looking man you see him every
[6:47] Sunday in there I
[6:48] [Laughter]
[6:51] maybe what he it's it's in history it
[6:56] shows that Columba went to this fort to
[7:00] see this King and Trevor was actually
[7:03] standing at the foundation of the gate
[7:06] where the fort actually was so he was
[7:08] standing there talking about that the
[7:11] Kings weren't enough stay with Columba
[7:13] in Christianity so he locked it he
[7:16] locked yeah these other people would say
[7:21] man so the King bard began to clump out
[7:25] in Calamba just walk up to the gate and
[7:27] they said he bowed his head and brains
[7:29] he just put his hand up on the gates of
[7:31] the dangers no but he walks right in and
[7:35] Columbus also use Newton but my point is
[7:38] you think well he was just uh he was a
[7:41] monk he was a monk he was brief and he
[7:45] was as we would think insignificant but
[7:49] not but he was known as the priest that
[7:53] light followed it everywhere he went
[7:55] there was a bright light with always
[7:56] even when he died there was a great
[7:59] light came into the room and then it
[8:01] went out as Mike Trevor was saying
[8:04] Steven the length of dark ages
[8:07] Khalid I'd and then you had a thousand
[8:10] years of persecution by Rome and all the
[8:13] difference all the different factions in
[8:15] the world fighting and and what war with
[8:18] each other so
[8:19] Columbo was many many times that was a
[8:23] light involved with his life he would go
[8:25] in to pray in a chapel and the people
[8:27] would walk by and the whole place would
[8:32] be lit up inside but no maybe one little
[8:35] candle but they would see it from afar
[8:36] off and I said well that's for Columbus
[8:38] in a dream so many different miracles
[8:42] but yeah if you have a chance though and
[8:45] we'll try I know Joe shall need the link
[8:47] on my phone but Trevor iman's he's them
[8:50] he's administering the message in
[8:51] Jeffersonville with defected Nathan
[8:54] right right there you go Nathan Bryan
[8:57] and he actually likes it he went to
[9:00] Ireland and went to the place where
[9:02] Columbus live had a little Church there
[9:05] the fort was there so it's kind of neat
[9:07] how he walked around different things he
[9:09] didn't go very far
[9:10] why did did you you went thing did you
[9:13] go to the fort he went to the fort well
[9:15] then he's all right there I mean Columba
[9:17] didn't live maybe 10 miles square and
[9:20] that's about all he had but his message
[9:22] was so powerful what I'm saying is his
[9:24] life was no powerful the people picked
[9:26] that life up and took it into that for
[9:29] church age being the darkest age dark
[9:31] ages so God's gonna say now so I tell
[9:36] you that he said Columba into Ireland in
[9:40] different places over there to be a
[9:42] testimony but his testimony went
[9:44] worldwide because not only because
[9:46] remember the Christians were being
[9:48] persecuted and remember what the foxes
[9:50] Book of Martyrs was written during that
[9:51] time because Rome started really
[9:54] persecuting the Christians because in
[9:55] 606 they adopted all these different
[9:58] things different and I say things father
[10:00] son Holy Ghost baptism all these
[10:02] different religions are different
[10:04] actually what Catholicism began that
[10:09] there was so much of a protest of it
[10:11] till they would just send people out and
[10:13] just if you're not if you just brother
[10:16] everything you just say the Lord Jesus
[10:17] Christ as your Savior they kill you
[10:19] all right because like what the problem
[10:22] yeah Rome would do it but the problem
[10:23] was they were trying to get you to
[10:25] convert to Catholicism which is supposed
[10:27] to been the Lord Jesus Christ but what
[10:29] it was is they wanted you to
[10:31] surf the Pope as the intercessor they
[10:33] wanted you to do them novenas they
[10:35] wanted you to do to this they want you
[10:37] to do that you know all these different
[10:38] things they wanted you to do to get to
[10:41] this Jesus Christ and everybody else is
[10:43] like no I'm saved by grace through faith
[10:47] by the Lord Jesus Christ coming into my
[10:49] life and what happened is this
[10:52] Satan crushed that church age almost
[10:56] call them the dark ages
[10:58] but brother Brown said that was to
[11:00] fulfill part of the scripture where
[11:02] Jesus said a corner weak must fall on
[11:05] the ground if it died by the one so what
[11:07] happened is that the church age came up
[11:09] came up it died in here light almost won
[11:12] out and then it came back up again and
[11:14] we'll talk about that it started as the
[11:17] man I know that works for charity
[11:20] excuse me and service and faith and thy
[11:23] patience and thy works and the last to
[11:27] be more than the first notwithstanding I
[11:31] have a few things against him because
[11:32] now stuff first that woman Jezebel
[11:36] reading Jezebel religion rather uncommon
[11:38] Jezebel religion didn't begin down here
[11:43] when Jezebel wasn't alive which is way
[11:44] down there in the history of time the
[11:47] genzaburo religion began right in here
[11:50] when they adopted this plate got up into
[11:53] three people they made it where you
[11:54] there wasn't there was hell was eternal
[11:57] there was the purgatory and there was a
[11:59] dis there wasn't that so he said I have
[12:01] something against you because you stuff
[12:02] rest that woman Jezebel which calleth
[12:05] herself a prophetess now remember she
[12:10] come by a church so this church has
[12:13] inserted their self in their doctrine in
[12:15] the four church a G's McHugh T tends to
[12:18] do service to commit fornication and to
[12:22] eat things sacrificed unto idols and I
[12:27] gave her space to repent of her
[12:29] fornication and she repented not in
[12:31] other words basically he gave her the
[12:33] whole thousand years to repent and she
[12:36] did she the church
[12:38] see the turtles went out and started
[12:41] prostituting herself
[12:42] amen amen behold I will cast her into a
[12:48] bed and then that commit adultery with
[12:50] her into Great Tribulation except they
[12:53] repent of their deeds and I will kill
[12:55] her children with death now what
[12:57] happened is and I will kill her children
[12:59] this is not physical now this is
[13:02] spiritual all right he's spiritually
[13:04] going to kill I will kill her children
[13:06] with death and all the churches shall
[13:10] know that I am he which searcheth the
[13:12] reins in the heart no given to every one
[13:14] of you according to your works but unto
[13:17] you I stand unto the rest of time Tyrel
[13:19] as many of them not this doctrine which
[13:22] I've known did not known the depths of
[13:24] Satan himself that church age is so
[13:27] horrible that the doctrine of Jezebel
[13:30] and the depths of Satan but watch what
[13:34] he says I will put upon you none other
[13:37] burden okay like we were talking about
[13:40] last night in the Bible study each
[13:42] person is given a responsibility in an
[13:46] age like Moses we were talking about
[13:49] Moses last night
[13:51] Moses is revelation of his whole life
[13:53] was was to get the children of Israel
[13:55] out of Egypt and get them into a
[13:57] promised land that was his job he's got
[14:00] one ting to build a boat he's job went
[14:02] to be them aside his job wedding to be
[14:04] the fourth church age Mason you're the
[14:05] first of the second of the third he job
[14:08] was to get people of Columbus job was
[14:11] preach the word to the people and God
[14:14] said oh I'm not gonna put any other
[14:16] burden on you you don't have to go
[14:19] around and and be adopted you know not
[14:23] call this is this is the age of adoption
[14:25] not then this is the age of nothing so
[14:27] we're called to it they weren't called
[14:29] to an option they were called just to
[14:31] make it through their church age okay
[14:35] but I say but unto you I say and
[14:39] resultados means have not this doctrine
[14:41] what the doctrine of Jezebel in which
[14:46] I'm not known the depths of Satan as
[14:48] they speak I will put upon you none of
[14:51] but that which you have already
[14:54] holdfast so whatever they have coming
[14:58] out of the third church age into the
[14:59] fourth Columba being their preacher
[15:01] minister messenger to the church age
[15:05] dude but that would you have already
[15:07] hold fast till I come in other words
[15:10] those martyrs are going to be put away
[15:14] in another dimension they're waiting
[15:16] they're gathered with Columba waiting on
[15:19] you and i right and he that overcometh
[15:23] and keepeth my works unto the end to him
[15:25] will I give power over the nation's and
[15:28] he shall rule them with a rod of iron
[15:29] remember that Jesus Christ through the
[15:32] people probably as the vessels of a
[15:37] Potter shall they be broken to shivers
[15:39] even as I received of my father and I
[15:42] will give him the morning star people
[15:45] have an ear let him hear what the spirit
[15:47] saith unto the churches
[15:49] alright now we're going to the remember
[15:53] the fourth church age they had just a
[15:55] little bit of strength they had just
[15:56] enough to get them through the church
[15:58] age all they did was was was profess
[16:02] they were Christians trying to live a
[16:04] Christian life the best they could
[16:05] Rome and the other plate people tried to
[16:09] snuff them out they put him in the they
[16:11] put him in the arenas and and there in
[16:14] Athens Greeks and all the different one
[16:16] they put him on end and you know put the
[16:18] lines out and their leopards and the
[16:19] Tigers and all that remember those story
[16:25] in foxes Book of Martyrs and they were
[16:27] given their life and as they were
[16:30] walking into the arena they were so over
[16:33] you know I mean it was like there
[16:36] weren't being made to go most others had
[16:40] to be dragged and prodded and probably
[16:42] knocked unconscious to get them to go in
[16:45] there but these were going in so
[16:46] willingly that the that the history
[16:49] tells us that some of the Roman soldiers
[16:50] were so convicted they laid their
[16:52] storage down and their shields and they
[16:54] walked right in there with them will
[16:55] they give their life for God that's the
[16:58] true testimony yes that's the true
[17:01] testimony that we want we were talking
[17:03] about last night our yesterday to the
[17:06] young people we want to be such a
[17:07] testimony of that somebody is going to
[17:11] be drawn to you then they'll receive
[17:13] salvation right through you not talking
[17:16] about so much presenting the life that's
[17:22] what they did in their fourth church age
[17:23] they presenting to life to the world now
[17:25] the work of the world that's was so
[17:28] horrible to the world they were kind of
[17:31] you around but in God's plan these
[17:36] people had to be in that age and to have
[17:38] that remember when we were talking about
[17:40] the the lion the Ox the man and the
[17:43] eagle back to the characteristics of the
[17:46] Holy Ghost in the church a lion the ox
[17:50] man and eagle so you got your ops which
[17:54] is why beasts of burden he's slow but
[17:57] man he could pull this you know he can
[17:59] pull this building down if he he had
[18:01] enough um but it was a slope and that's
[18:03] what they were doing in that turkey that
[18:05] is the longest church age it lasted for
[18:08] over a thousand years of persecution a
[18:13] thousand years that supposedly
[18:18] Christendom are this is where
[18:20] Constantine and all the ones come in to
[18:22] develop the Crusaders that put the cross
[18:26] on their backs and said they were
[18:27] Christians if they were killing
[18:29] Christians right and left alright so
[18:32] that was why it's called the Dark Ages
[18:34] but to me it was one of the greatest
[18:37] because of what Columba was a messenger
[18:40] of life but his light all they needed
[18:45] was was just enough light to get through
[18:49] that church age by just saying that I
[18:51] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and I
[18:53] don't need a pope well you know they
[18:54] automatically cook it off but they'll be
[18:57] given I mean they're already sitting in
[18:59] a dimension with eternal life but man
[19:02] they'll be giving this edge right here
[19:03] the table with us they down here at the
[19:06] bottom he that overcometh keeping my
[19:09] work stand him will I give power
[19:11] nation so they're going to be able to
[19:12] rule they've got to meet them roaming
[19:17] people and all the people that put them
[19:19] to death they'll meet them at judgement
[19:21] and they'll say that's what you did you
[19:27] did that so that we can have eternal
[19:30] life
[19:31] alright let's go to number four then to
[19:33] the angel of the church in Sardis Sardis
[19:37] is the second dirt I always use these
[19:40] three interchanges it it's the first
[19:42] church age of the Reformation yeah right
[19:46] did everybody know why we call
[19:49] Protestants and Catholics let me tell
[19:52] you this before we get started you
[19:54] should already know this
[19:59] [Laughter]
[20:03] okay Catholicism started in the fourth
[20:10] the reason I'm saying is this it's gonna
[20:12] help us as we go through this yeah
[20:14] because this is gonna be the Protestant
[20:16] there was no protesting down here you
[20:19] know the degree that they're fixing to
[20:20] be okay so the word products that comes
[20:24] from Hoover protests what did they
[20:28] protest they protested the Catholic
[20:31] Church that's when they called their
[20:33] self Protestants and Catholics that was
[20:37] a division because remember me today
[20:41] there was no denomination anywhere
[20:46] through here now there was
[20:47] denominationally minded people if you
[20:51] have your own idea your denomination T
[20:53] self that there was no named
[20:55] denomination when they come into this
[20:57] page right here it was dominated by
[21:00] Catholicism Roman a truth world
[21:04] so what be Constantine do Constantine
[21:07] and brother Graham tells us this in the
[21:09] church if you reach your finger brother
[21:12] mom tells us Nick that's when church and
[21:14] state comes together Constantine was a
[21:16] poor guy Rome you know he had all the
[21:22] zoo
[21:22] forward all the gods on his side and
[21:24] then he sees that Roman Catholic Church
[21:26] is getting all this money for
[21:27] indulgences and all this money they do
[21:29] and land that they're taking from people
[21:31] and so Constantine says I'm over here
[21:34] starving let's combine these two so
[21:38] that's where brother mount said church
[21:40] and state are a having Jesse Bell FY
[21:42] says in this church age is I have
[21:46] someone against you because you actually
[21:47] let that woman doctrine come into my
[21:52] church but what it was was church and
[21:54] state come together Constantine was
[21:58] supposed to be in a fuel read how many
[21:59] other remember reading about him at
[22:01] school and I remember reading about him
[22:02] in school cuz I did a essay on him and
[22:06] liked eleventh attempt 11th grade and
[22:10] history makes him a great man oh he
[22:14] combined all this together and but what
[22:17] happened was the underlying meaning of
[22:18] the whole thing was is he was a heathen
[22:21] right and there was a Roman Catholic
[22:25] Church in the Roman Catholic churches
[22:27] well we need his power because he's got
[22:28] the big army and all this though and he
[22:32] said we need their gold so I can fund my
[22:37] army with what he does is he brings
[22:39] church and state together he brings Rome
[22:42] as the seat he brings church and state
[22:45] together and then that's what ruled in
[22:49] this thousand year he put crosses on her
[22:53] back and send a mountain they slaughter
[22:56] millions of people foxes Book of Martyrs
[22:58] they slaughter millions of people
[23:00] because of what they believe but now
[23:03] what happens is is when we come out of
[23:05] that age into Luther's age remember the
[23:10] messenger always comes at the end of the
[23:11] age right
[23:12] okay got that we've been taught this
[23:15] river and ever ever even you kids on the
[23:17] lift the Martin Luther didn't come right
[23:20] here at the end of his church age he
[23:22] couldn't do that
[23:22] he came at the end of the Catholic age
[23:25] brother Aaron calls it or the end of
[23:27] Columbus a Martin Luther comes right
[23:28] here why because this
[23:30] right here had been eat down so much
[23:33] what was God gonna do he's gonna have a
[23:35] revival through Martin Luther Martin
[23:39] Luther was actually in this catholic age
[23:44] because he was in the kind of jerk run
[23:47] but what struck him was is all this
[23:50] penance and all these things they trying
[23:52] to do to save their self and there's no
[23:55] way you can do that
[23:56] so God revealed to him one scripture the
[23:59] just shall live by faith that started
[24:02] when he drove those ninety-five theses
[24:04] on the wall and what Umberto River it
[24:07] was that started a protest not to an
[24:14] alley to catch the turn but to protest
[24:17] what they were doing that started if I
[24:20] have read email the Protestant movement
[24:25] which started as Methodist then Lutheran
[24:29] then baptistin than Pentecostal then
[24:31] Wesley ISM and every other ISM it you
[24:34] see from right now today all started
[24:37] because of Martin Luther protesting are
[24:41] coming out of the Catholic Church
[24:43] everybody got that so it was a protest
[24:46] that's why it's called Protestant they
[24:48] protested the Catholic Church y'all
[24:54] remember several years ago when that
[24:56] rabbi when that what was his name Tony
[25:02] anyway of the Catholic priest and he was
[25:05] talking to the Lutheran's and the
[25:06] Westlands and and he said nobody tell me
[25:10] to back off for you he said the
[25:12] Reformation is over or well they're
[25:15] protesting is over why are you
[25:17] protesting we're all one that guy
[25:19] remember he got killed on motorcycles
[25:21] don't let the spirit of will hide and
[25:22] all that coming in the Kenneth Hagin
[25:23] kept hanging a little boy hurt he
[25:25] Kenneth Hagin bowed to him I guess
[25:27] anyway Tony but anyway so that's why you
[25:33] will say it up here in this outrage he's
[25:35] saying the protesting is over why is he
[25:37] saying that well now the Catholics and
[25:40] everybody else are pretty much back just
[25:43] like the
[25:43] says we'll see if a little while later
[25:45] on that that great mother never
[25:48] dies and she has daughters her daughters
[25:52] are sorry to say this but brother Brown
[25:55] tell just Methodist Baptist Pentecostal
[25:59] randomise if you're not warning in all
[26:02] the different things but you and I are
[26:06] still protesting we're still Protestants
[26:09] right because we're protesting every bit
[26:11] of that now we're not worldwide and
[26:12] we're not like this movement was
[26:14] worldwide Luther and Wesley that was a
[26:18] worldwide movement now it's just
[26:21] remember I told you the revival is going
[26:23] to be an individual revival in each
[26:24] person alright just about four more
[26:27] minutes let's begin around here and unto
[26:29] the Church of the angel the church in
[26:31] sardis now this is Martin Luther this is
[26:33] the characteristic that Martin Luther is
[26:35] going to have to carry to get them out
[26:37] of this fourth church age because he
[26:39] comes at the end of the catholic age to
[26:41] the end of the age of thought ira right
[26:44] and brings his message hey he's messy
[26:48] just the starters if i got that okay and
[26:53] into the angel of the church in Sardis
[26:55] write these things says he that hath the
[26:57] seven stars spirits of God and the Seven
[27:00] Stars I know that work that thou has to
[27:02] name that that Olympus that aren't dead
[27:04] now remember in this church age right
[27:08] here when they were coming out of they
[27:12] never denied the name Jesus has always
[27:16] been the savior even to the Roman
[27:18] Catholic
[27:19] even if you go talk to the Pope today
[27:20] they know Jesus Christ as the Saviour
[27:22] but they've inserted that Pope man in
[27:25] the instead of in the place of God so he
[27:31] says here he says I know that without a
[27:33] son named that L liveth and are dead the
[27:39] name begins to come
[27:41] now watch now has a name that they'll
[27:45] live it and aren't dead this is what
[27:48] brother Brown says he says are you a
[27:50] Christian I'm Baptist
[27:52] are you a Christian I'm Methodist that's
[27:57] the man in it and they're dead and you
[28:02] know what they've done they nicely
[28:03] killed the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[28:05] in baptism during this time because
[28:07] remember before 606 they baptize in the
[28:10] name of Lord Jesus Christ the Christians
[28:11] did they killed it right here and even
[28:15] Martin Luther he baptized in the titles
[28:20] of Father Son Holy Ghost because it
[28:22] wasn't his time he was reforming
[28:24] bringing out through that Reformation he
[28:29] was bringing out the just shall live by
[28:31] faith
[28:32] that's his part is what was evident
[28:34] Moses Moses didn't have to build an ark
[28:36] Moses didn't have to die on the cross
[28:37] Moses had a job well Martin Luther had a
[28:40] job protest the Catholic Church separate
[28:43] yourself and the just shall live by
[28:46] faith
[28:48] that was his message and as we always
[28:52] say
[28:52] Luther listen Luther with the German
[28:55] Germans drink beer like we drink tea
[28:57] especially back then watch my brother
[29:00] Brent say he said he could send the pub
[29:02] drink of beer and smoke a pipe and talk
[29:05] about God what there was just that
[29:07] little bit of heart that he needed he
[29:09] needed to get them people out of the
[29:10] Catholic Church protest what they were
[29:13] doing and then get them into the body of
[29:15] Christ get them back to reading the
[29:17] Bible because what happened was they
[29:19] started to try to compile the Bible in
[29:21] here and they did the Catholic Church
[29:24] would let them doing them they they
[29:25] forbid it but Martin Luther and Tyndale
[29:30] and all those different ones in history
[29:32] they begin to start putting the Bible
[29:35] back together and the Catholic Church
[29:36] hated it they wanted them everybody to
[29:39] just go it's an detergent and excuse me
[29:42] but you know Latin
[29:44] everything was in Latin and you just
[29:47] went to church and you heard the priest
[29:48] and you saw the little boy do this
[29:51] the candle here and the ba-ba-ba-ba-bom
[29:52] and then you went home and you were
[29:54] saved because you the priest read you
[29:57] the word of common land but Martin
[30:00] Luther and even in John Wesley's town
[30:02] they were trying to get the people put
[30:04] the thing in English King James English
[30:07] Bible okay be watchful and strengthen
[30:11] the things which remain that are ready
[30:15] to die for I have not found thy works
[30:17] perfect before God so their works were
