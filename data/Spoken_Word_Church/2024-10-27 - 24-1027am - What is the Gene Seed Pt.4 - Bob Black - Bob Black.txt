========================================

one second I was asking me to pay I've already paid my dues let's go to the Lord in prayer Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather together around your word this morning Lord we ask Lord that you'll bless us today prepare our hearts and our minds to receive what you have for us today Lord and I pray God that you'll just have Liberty to be with us Grant it Lord now that you'll guide through your word we ask in your name amen now we've been uh uh and I sure appreciate the brothers filling in the last couple of Sundays um uh while we're while we're traveling more than a couple wasn't at any rate we sure appreciate that um sure appreciate everything they brought and we're uh going through uh just this thought what is what is that genan seed and in Romans 9:13 we were reading the scripture as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated and uh that's quoting the scripture in Malachi chapter one that says I have loved you sayith the Lord yet you say wherein hast thou loved us was not Esau Jacob's brother sayith the Lord yet I love Jacob and I hated Esau and laid his mountains and his Heritage waste for the dragons of the Wilderness so now just really want to just re rehash some things because I know repetition helps but really want to nail down what what is what is it what really what is it and we're so we're talking about you know really meditate on why why did Jacob love what why did God love Jacob and hate Esau before the world was created before anything was acted out and it all hinges on this concept of forn knowledge that God before the the foundation of the world could could look and see um not just how you would respond at a specific situation but how you would always respond no matter where whether he put you in this age or this age or wherever whatever age that you're you would always respond now I got kind of a little exercise I want to do this morning so it's only going to take 5 seconds and I'm going to need some audience participation don't get scared you won't have to do nothing or say nothing except just come up and and uh and receive these envelopes that I got already written out with some brothers names on them now now we're playing out an exercise here so that you really get it I already got these names written out and then I'm going to call your name out now think about you sitting in the service and the gospel is being preached and it's it's like your name is being called out and and you've got the option to respond or not but I already got the names written now now Terrence I got an envelope up for you so if you just come up and get it that's all you got to do is just come get it and I got one for you brother Louise there's a scripture in it and you can read that as your leisure it's just a scripture and I got one for you brother Ryan now how could I write that down in advance cuz I knew in advance that you would want it and you'd come get it sorry they had it written down for you now there there's nailing down what what is that genan c it's already there for you and now now that ties into everything all these deep things that's the Lamb's Book of Life he already wrote your name down because he knew that that when you were presented with it that you would respond to it now now let's look at it from the other side of the coin did I did I force you to take it did I go up there and and put you in a headlock and and and Wrangle you to the front you better take it no it's totally it's totally up to you right and and nobody's forced to do nothing was there something inherent did did you already have like the envelope in you somehow or in your possession no no it wasn't already in your possession but it was there waiting on you and so that's where you frame up these these these uh kind of hard to understand Concepts that brother brand was present when he say well the reason the reason you wanted it is because it was already there but it was already there because he knew you'd want it that's right see the reason it's actually drawing you that that when I give you that invitation it's actually it's it's it's it's drawing you cuz God knew that you would want it so brother Rand would say he'd say your your life now you're what you're living out right right there right right now is is the thought that God had before the foundation of the world right so it's that envelope that I had in my possession that I already got your name written on it I got a little scripture for you so that when you open it up you can read that scripture that has something it's got it was a scripture really about predestination and forn knowledge so you open that up it kind of Echoes something in you and that you begin to live that out what was what was known about you from before the foundation of the world so you're actually living out right then right now what what God thought about and he said and knoweth it not he said I was in Christ you were in Christ before the foundation of the world he came to redeem his own his own that was in him Hallelujah his children that was in him now you think about that we're making a little illustration with envelopes but that you were actually such a part of God you're the thought that not not that you were running around I I keep hearing Minister saor we don't believe in that Mormon doctrine of predestination of souls but but we believe in a doctrine of pre uh not a Mor a doctrine of pre-existence of souls but we believe in a doctrine of pre-existence of souls no we don't frame it up like that you're not running around we don't believe in any doctrine of pre-existence of souls it's the the way that brother R said that is because he's framing up the Mormons are the ones that kind of put that out there but it's not that you as an individual are running around back there but that you the thought of God was uh God had a thought of you that was so much a part of him until it well it was a part of him it's an eternal part of him Eternal attribute that was going to be expressed sooner or later right amen so you were in Christ before the foundation of the world he came to redeem his own his own that was in him Allelujah his children that was in him so then we got those two those two extremes that we read about in in Matthew Chapter 13 I I wonder maybe just pose the question did anybody read Matthew chapter 13 God bless you now now there's there's the struggle of a minister church is not just about coming to CH you got to go home and meditate and think about it that's why I'm I'm expressing these things so you go home and open up Matthew 13 and sit there and look at it and think about it and read those two Parables and and think and and and sit and look and and these two extremes are exactly what we just acted out there's an envelope that already written out but then there's a time when you got to receive it and so the first Parable or the uh it's actually the last Parable in verse 38 where that the swer went forth to seow and the good seed are the children of the Kingdom in other words there's attributes there in God that are already pre-written out that are are are waiting to be man manifest but then the other end of that spectrum is that he that receiv receives seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word so what are you hearing you're hearing that Eternal part of God that's expressed here in time that God come down and through a minister through a prophet preached the word and it expresses what go was in God all the way back before the foundation of the world in other words you're heing the word what's what's the what's the gene seed of God it's the word the thought of God the part of God right that was in him from the beginning yes now so we've got these two extremes in Matthew 13:38 and Matthew 13:23 really what what are these two extremes that's Calvinism and Armenian ISM brother Bob you getting too beep hold on Calvinism says well it it's just so much grace that God said these are going to be saved and these are going to be lost and and and that's the end of the story and then Armenian ISM on the other end is that you're it's what you do here in time you're acting it out and you but the truth lies between these two extremes that the Calvinism P part of it is that if there's an envelope for you you can't get away from it but the envelope is there cuz God knew that you would want it and you put those two together and then you got the truth of it Calvinism is that eternal security that before creation God the way they look at it the calvinist that God actively decreed who would be saved and lost and and of course that extreme Calvinism view is God predestines purely based on God's Sovereign will and good pleasure and then on the other hand Armenian ism is it's human choose who to AC to accept God and salvation is completely dependent on human effort but the to link those two together you got to have four knowledge right now that's why the the message is different than the way pretty much any other denomination looks at things because of this of this thought of of forn knowledge that links these two together that God can predestinate by knowing in advance what you're going to do and how you're going to react which is why brother R would say God by his for knowledge saw exactly who would be saved and who wouldn't be saved so so uh we're really clenching down it was there was there a little glowing piece of light down in you when you were born of your natural birth no but but there was a thought of God that he had about you that was waiting to be manifested so for knowledge affirms that doctrine of for knowledge affirms both human responsibility and God's sovereignty and Grace So predestination comes as a result of for knowledge not arbitrary Choice that's why brother R would make that statement predestination looks back to forn knowledge how does God know how where where to put his Angel to guide your life and where which one to breed to which and uh what family to put you in and all the situations in life where how how to influence your life predestination looks to for knowledge so he can look down to see how you're going to respond to situations and for knowledge looks to Destiny Destiny is what you going to do what you going to do with that envelope for knowledge looks to Destiny so predestination having that envelope to begin with looks to how what you're going to do with that envelope now the whole thing F hinges to for knowledge but it also hinges on free will this concept that you are in control there there's nobody going to force you to do anything I I I was really I I've been meditating on on control and how the devil almost He he'll come in and he'll use use a he'll try to control things sometimes by pretending to know in advance what's going to happen you know you see like a little sister that she's talking to a young boy and he'll come in and he'll say he'll try to manipulate things and he'll say well I'll tell you I'll tell you right right now we're supposed to get married and you know I was I was thinking this morning even just just saying something like that that sometimes people's response is well how do you what if he really does know that you're supposed to get married let things play out there's a lot of other things to look at than just just whether somebody knows what's going to happen or whether somebody has some kind of premonition or something that because look you you you got to the whole thing is based on God God takes his hands off of the situation and lets you make your own decision right God takes his hands off of it and does not try to control whenever you've got control of a situation even like like parents sometimes they'll they want to get their hands all they see their kids struggling trying to come to God and they they want to get their hands in there and and and and and have something where they can say well I had something to do with it or whatever but some so many times if you'll just take your hands off of it because if you've got your hands in it then God can't do what he wants to do like that story of of uh of brother brandham uh you know we want to see his son Billy Paul saved and and and the spirit gets to moveing and draw in Billy Paul and next thing you know here's a deacon tapping on his shoulder and the Deacon tapping on his shoulder why don't you go up to the altar just mess everything up just trying trying to get in control to have to for God to get in control we got to take our hands off the situation and let God do what he wants to do and you know really that's that's what what we're trying to do in church is is set up things so that God can have Liberty to do where that we're not controlled by fear or by by any kind of coercion or something that we can just that God can just do with people the way that they want to do that you're you can worship you can raise your hands and worship you can run down the aisles if you want to do that but there's no fear or anything that's trying to prevent you from do for or prevent the holy ghost from doing what he wants to do you got to take your hands off of it like uh uh thinking of uh uh amram and uh what Moses parents amram and jocked I think were sitting there putting their little baby Moses in the bull rushes and and Aaron was just watching if he could have gone in there and going to stabbing at hippos and done all kinds of things but it would have messed the whole plan of God up if he tried to guide that little thing through that little bassinet through the through the bull rushes but if you just take your hands off of it and let God do every do what he wants to do then everything will work out right this morning I was reading a story uh that story of brother Brandon where he was uh he was talking to that brother Eli I think his name was and they had a little sick boy at home and he was telling him visions of of things that were taking place in his home and and and the man came to the Lord and then he went over to his house and he had a sick boy and and brother Brandon God had showed him a vision that that sick boy was going to be raised up and but uh and he it was like a situation where everything had to fall into place there was the two brothers there and the mom and and and the sick boy laying in the bassinet but he was waiting on the little old lady to come and sit down in the red chair and he jumped the gun cuzz God's not going to force you to do this or that he's going to allow you to do whatever and he jumped the gun and because he didn't wait for things to just fall into place then everything everything fell out of cater and he had to wait for the healing of that child until the morning until the next day and and and you I was thinking as he was relating that story I was actually getting stressed out reading that story cuz he was waiting for everything to fall into place the the sun went around the you know the sun was coming up they had to go to work he was going to be left at home with that little mama and the little baby you know he was waiting for everything to fall into place and he could not put his hand in there and say little old lady you got to sit in this chair that's right he could not go around and try to move things into place you have to wait for things to fall into place in other words and every and we're talking about having the envelope God's got the envelope but he is not going to force you to take it he's not going to force anything to fall into place he's just going to sit back and watch and and everything will fall into place if you just let it just let it fall into place and when we get our hands in there and start trying to move things around and trying to influence I think the worst thing that to do is try to take control of your children's life or your your some some try to get get involved in the best way to get involved is get on our knees and pray and let and let God go to work cuz if you really want to prove out that something is spiritual take your hands off take your hands off every single time and you see God go to work brother R said the God who is rich in Mercy he said many of you can fellowship with me on this thought when you was a little boy or a little girl you would walk around and there would be certain things that would just where it wouldn't bother the other kids it seemed like there was something in you they cried out there was God somewhere yet you were a sinner you remember that certainly now what was that that was that little form of life in you then a little form of life like not not eternal life down in you but the the a a representation that there's something that's going to come up a representation not something substantive but that God knew before the foundation of the world that eternal life was going to spring up in you and then after a while you heard this gospel maybe you went to church you picked out this and that and went from denomination to denomination but one day you being part of God you had to be part of the word and when you heard the word you know where you come from you know what was the truth you were always the seed was in you always what does that mean the seed was in you always is that representation was always there that one day you'd hear the word and it would spring to life what what would spring to life like something already planted the the potential for life to come up would manifest as you heard the word it would Express the word that the here he explains it the word seen the word that was in you that was before the foundation of the world world saw the word and you come to it let skip that one and the message communion he said then look up to the trees and I think Leaf I seen you fall off last year and why are you back there again where didd you come come from what brought you here see it was that eternal life working in the body now then one day as I walked on that voice talking don't never smoke drink so forth and the young fellas and all got older see there was something moving that's what's moving predestination that God's got it God's got that envelope for you he's got everything lined up because he knows that when you hear the word you're going to respond to it but yet all at once I looked up and I said I'm not the son of Charles and El brano there's something calling like my little Eagle I'm not a chicken there's something up yonder somewhere oh great Jehovah whoever you are open up I want to come home there's something in me calling then I was born again that little life was laying there the life of water was poured upon it then it began to grow so what's happening the predestinated characteristics or attributes within a believer will emerge as they respond to God's word and spirit that envelope that he had for you before the foundation of the world will come to life when you hear the when you hear what's in the envelope and the God who is rich in Mercy he said I believe that a man when he is born in this world that when you're a little baby born into the world you could not have been here without being the for knowledge of God because he is infinite and knows all things and when that little baby is Born Into the world there is something in that baby if he is ever going to have life there is a little something in there in that child then that he comes to sooner or later that little seed is in him and I'm laying these quotes out so that we don't draw back when you hear a Minister preach this because if you know what it means then you can rejoice and worship you not draw back and say well he I I don't think he believes right but you'll you'll you can Joy I you know if well let me lay that to the side what is that je brother R said in sman church he said be careful here and see this it is not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God it is the word or seed that is it way back there too far back for the human mind to grasp the Eternal god with eternal thoughts thought and decreed Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated and neither was born and neither had done good or evil see now here's he's laying it out it was the thought and then that thought became expressed and God bought back Jacob because Jacob alone was seed Jacob alone had a representation and why did he have a representation because God knew that he would accept it that's right just like Jesus walking to all those disciples and calling them by name your name is Simon and you the son of Jon us and he'd go up to the different disciples and knew exactly who they who they were and what where they would fit into his plan and he said now we know that Jesus told his Apostles that he knew them and he before the foundation of the world they were the attributes of his thoughts and the message identification he said look to show it's the ones that he thought of his thoughts is the Christian of today the thoughts before the foundation of the world now remember man when he was born in sin shaped in an Equity comes to the world speaking lies there is nothing in him at all now there's your quote for you you don't have an envelope you don't have a little glowing piece of light in you you don't have a spot of eternal life in you when you're born of your natural birth there's nothing in him at all but you see if he was in God's thoughts when he come to the world he's come in God's thoughts at the beginning to display his attribute then Jesus came to break the clouds back so that attribute could display itself amen that's it he is God's expressed word and then then youve got those two pieces fitting together the parable of Matthew 13 there at the end the attributes being expressed when the word is swn down in your heart and you receive it not on the Wayside not in Stony places not cast among Thorn but cast on the good ground of your heart that was predestinated by God's forn knowledge to receive the word from before the foundation of the world so you know I got this scripture in here Matthew 24:24 there shall arise false Christ in the last days and false prophets and shall so show great signs and wonders and it'll deceive everybody except for the very elect so there's going to be somebody that will fulfill that scripture so right now we are fulfilling this and other words this is like a thought of God that he thought of before the foundation of the world and right now we're actually living that out because there's going to be somebody in the end times that will fulfill the scripture that just like all the other scriptures that speak of the end time that there's going to be somebody that will not be deceived so the life in you is the thought he had then and that thought has been reflected through every scripture the word has identified us as the living expression of the thought of God and that's why you know when when Jesus sent his disciples out to go preach and and cast out devils and and you know they got real excited they they had power to cast out devils and they were real happy about that and Jesus had to he said had to bring them back to reality he said now that's great that you're rejoicing that you have power to cast out Devils but Rejoice rather that your names are written in heaven Rejoice that your name there's that envelope that God knew he had your name written down before the foundation of the world there something to Rejoice about why is that something to Rejoice about that you're part of God's plan and purpose what what is that writing down your name before the foundation of the world that's your eternal life so when you hear the word that's actually expressing that you it's it's your new birth it's expressing in you that God you were part of God in his thoughts from before the foundation of the world and you always were part of his thoughts and now everything that makes up his thoughts and his characteristics is expressed in in you his nature his habits his thoughts it's being expressed in you as you hear the word now that's something to Rejoice about is what Jesus is saying you you rejoice because you can cast out devils and you got power and those kind of things but what about what about just be to to know that you're part of part of God's body part of his plan part of his part part of his eternal uh Eternal attributes that's why brother R when that and God is rich in Mercy to tell that little Eagle story there was something something in him the little Eagle in the barnyard seemed to be different from what that chicken was because at the beginning in the thought of God he was an eagle all the way back in the thought of God if you are a Christian now a genuine predestinated seed you was in God before there was you always was in God the germ of your life which is an attribute of God which was his thought it's the germ seed word from the beginning that you was in God at the beginning standing here drawing the seed life the seed is in Your Heart by for ordination the seed is already in there by the for knowledge of God predestinated and when it draws it can't draw through nothing else but the word he's saying in the thinking man's filter and invisible Union of the bride of Christ he said let a real predestinated born germ predestinated by God hear the word of God it's music to him he knows it's the truth so so let's really clinch it here as we close down what what is the gene seed of God it's that you are part of his word from the very beginning but then when you hear the word it's expressed so the gene seed of God is the word it's the word from both ends of that perspective Genesis 12627 you are part of that spiritual man that was expressed in God from the before the foundation and when you hear the word it manifest that it's the word the word that you're hearing manifests the word that was back there and that's those two parables in Matthew 13 the attributes of God are expressed when you hear the word when the word falls into the good ground of your heart and I hope that uh you know they say teaching uh a real good teaching uh can clench it so good that you just can't get away from it so I hope that clenches it in that fashion God bless you [Applause] ch
