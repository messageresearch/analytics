this time in any any other time I always want to hear it special but uh if not at this time I'd like to ask a sister Nelly to give her testimony the Nicaragua shirt God bless you Saints I'm sorry I'm really nervous um first I just want to start by thanking brother and sister Eureka for um arranging everything and taking care of all of us and being the best tour guides um I want to thank my parents mom and dad for allowing me to go um I'm sorry so as you know we were supposed to reach Managua Wednesday but we only got to Houston and um after we got out off the plane we went in this line to see if we can um get another flight basically for that day or if they could schedule another flight and everyone was just tired and hungry and just exhausted um I know and the lesson I really learned from that was just putting it into the Lord's hands because we were like you know if it's if it's not your will Lord we won't go um maybe brother Louise and brother Bob can go but everyone else would just you know go home but um I really learned to just you know pray about and just put into the Lord's hands and he just makes a way and um that was that was a that was a real blessing um we so we um we got a flight for Friday and there was exactly you know eight seats and there was eight people so you know that was a real miracle and I just want to thank the Lord for that um in Nicaragua what um my gist of it was you know from washing dishes by hand and um being in Believers homes that didn't you know had um dirt flooring or using outhouses all I could see was just the happiness in their eyes and their hearts and how serious they were about the Lord how content they were and I just wish that we could be more like that you know um to have very little and still put God above everything and um I just love being with them the atmosphere they're really sweet people they're just wonderful brothers and sisters and honestly when Christy and them go back I'm on the next flight back it was just a real blessing and um putting all of these things into perspective has just moved my heart closer to the Lord and I was very humbled by this experience so thank you all for praying with us praying for us it was just a real blessing thank you [Applause] amen I will now give my testimony of the trip um once again if anyone has a special they'll be afraid to raise your hand uh I actually I can start off with that that in Nicaragua almost every uh service we went to there was at least like four or five specials so maybe we could think about that and just feel free to come up but um I know I want to thank uh brother Louise Sister Christine for uh facilitating the whole trip you know allowing us to you know they know people and allowing us to go with them and for the church and all the donations and everything that really helped out with the trip Miss Percy once thought our flights got delayed and canceled and all that you know your money really kept us afloat that we were able to stay at a hotel you know and because God wanted us to go on this trip like in Central Iowa said there was only eight seats and sorry there was only eight seats and uh we were able to all eight of us were able to get on so like like shanella said that was really a miracle and God really wanted us to go right so so thank you for your donations uh everyone if your first language is English please raise your hand that's wonderful okay I think we should all thank God that our first language first language is English because this message came in English and we're all able to easily read it read the tapes read the books listen to the message and and in different parts of the country where the first language isn't English they need interpreters they need translators they need all these different we need many people from here to go over there who know both languages many people like maybe brother Bob who only knows one language but he can't just go by himself and he's someone like brother Louise and there's just so much more that there's so many more barriers that they have to go through to get to this message so we should just all be that grateful that we happen to speak English and that should happen to be our first thing we haven't been born in a English-speaking country where the message came in English and that's why brother Branham says that America is going to get a special you know punishment because we speak English the message came in English that we had an American prophet and and we have all this technology and all this all this access and information and we just don't use it right so we're going to get a special punishment if we don't grasp this word and really take hold of all the blessings that we've just been blessed with there's nothing of our own Merit we've just been born here and that's just it's incredible and we need to be thankful for that every day and also want to talk about just uh something this trip made me really grateful for is the progress that the missionary field has made in in all the years because it's just you know when that scripture says that you know spread the gospel to the utmost parts of the earth you know and we go to this this small little Island where I mean there's one message Church on the entire island people have dirt houses you know they're washing clothes by hand they're washing everything by hand they're doing everything by hand there's no they don't call a plumber they don't call a carpenter unless it's the guy around the around the street that they know that it works with wood but they they have so little and they're just so out of the way but the fact that we're able to get to them and minister to them and fellowship with them it's it's truly a blessing so the the just the progress that the missionary field has made and message analysis was saying they're all very friendly people even through the language barrier we're trying to understand them but they're a very happy smiling up ready to talk to you it's an incredible thing and and also the the progress of the missionary field is also my own personal testimony because you know a prophet one time went to Africa to do some some missionary work and that missionary work spread all the way to Zimbabwe where my method his grandfather had a firstborn daughter who could then meet someone who was in the message and then comes me who I can also be born to the message and born you know under under the right atmosphere to receive the message as well so that's just the progress of that and how how much it spread and that's why that's why we're called to spread the gospel we're called to you know whoever we run into we need to we need to try and get that word out and that's how we're gonna that's how we're gonna get out of here is making sure every every child every every person of God gets that new birth gets that experience kind of Statute perfect man comes to Perfection and then we can all leave so that's why we need to continue the missionary field so I'm very grateful for that and also just um just to know that you know we have brothers and sisters everywhere and that we all know each other you know by by the spirit you know even brother Brandon said you can talk to someone and you can figure out that whether or not they're a Christian within five minutes so and just to be able to talk to people and even through the language barrier we can understand that they're you know Spirit-filled Christians and Spirit-filled Believers it was good to know them so I think that first well with uh the song I want to sing which is they will know we were Christians by our love [Music] We Are One on in the spirit we are one in the Lord we are one in the spirit we are one in the Lord and we pray that all Unity will one day be restored and they'll know we are Christians by our love by our love yes they'll know we are Christians by our love we will walk with each other we will walk hand in hand we will walk with each other we will walk hand in hand and together we'll spread the news that God is in our land they will know we are Christians by our love by our love they will know we are Christians by our love we will work with each other we will work side by side we will work with each other we will work side by side and we'll guard each man's dignity and save each man's Pride they will know we are Christians by our love by our love they will know we are Christians by our love all praise to the father from whom all things will come and all praise to Christ Jesus is one and only son and all praise to the spirit who makes us all as one and they'll know we are Christians by our love by our love they will know we are Christians by our love we are one in the spirit we are one in the Lord we are one in the spirit we are one in the Lord and we pray that our Unity will one day be restored and they'll know we are Christians by our love by our love they will know we are Christians by our love foreign [Applause] good job let's give him another hand we appreciate each and every one of you coming we appreciate the time that you've come that you've given to come today and listen to our to our brother pour his heart out if you have anybody have anything as special or or anything else they want to want to sing before we get started because we're going to let brother Daryl out we're going to cut him loose and let him just preach It's Hard Out yes sir yes ma'am I sure would love for you to come and sing I knew there was somebody [Applause] yes ma'am you come on we got plenty of time I'll play the bass while I'm back there amen well the other day um the girls at my husband being gone we had our little bible time together and there's this song that I think at my old church where I got saved at many years ago and they're saying it to the girls I said he's just in my testimony and I want to get emotions when I was a testimony meant a lot to me and I know God's love is real and salvation is real and he really did save me I mean I was a real sinner I'm just being honest I dress bad I talk bad I cussed I did everything you know I didn't do drugs and stuff like that I was out there you know dressing bad was dressing good to me you know I didn't know any better I cut all my hair off you know if you saw somebody like well she's unsavable you know one time John his daddy had us to go down to um to make in Georgia to deliver some money for his dad for somebody down there for a job or someone pick up some money and we went down there and these Christian folks took us out to eat they were so kind to me I didn't know their message Believers or anything we just took us out got some ribs and everything just treated us so good and I had my pants on you know I was just you know just a world but they're so sweet to me I didn't know what was different about them but now they're messy Believers maybe they pray for me so I'm just grateful for their kindness so you never know you're meeting like how they look or don't judge people how they look don't judge a book by its cover you don't know like what's in their heart you know I know in my heart like I always want to be clean and that's what drawed me to this message it's like we went to like some kind of little fake church I just call it that before we end up comes to the message he was raising the message and I came to the next couldn't hear it they're like we need to dress better I was like I'm like what these other girls dressing bad I'm gonna continue and how I need to dress but when I heard the true word of the message like I knew that this was a true salvation for a woman to wear a dress like you know like the 100 way like not 60 not 40 not 10 and I want to encourage every sister and brother to keep your purity if there's one thing I cry out for your Purity is worth so much it's so beautiful for a young man a young woman to keep themselves in the Lord and say bathe and clean in his presence now I'm speaking as a mother I'm not speaking as a teen now speaking as an older mother now big children 20 year old almost 17 year old in a few weeks and a 14 year old I beseech you all keep holding on with the god with the Lord Keep Holding On like it will be hard you know I want to last y'all it will be hard but y'all keep holding on y'all it's so beautiful and precious in His sight you guys are gems you guys are diamonds I tell my girls I begged them I only had a path I had so I testify to ollie I'm not ashamed he is the one that cleansed me he is the one that gave me this life he's the one that gave me a family he's the one that gave me a God believe in God fearing husband is only by his grace there is nothing good in me so I just wanted to encourage each of you and this song it's a song that's saying I don't know how we're gonna get it I don't know how my voice will be but I want to sing it for his glory because it meant a lot to me years ago and it still means a lot to me now exactly I would love to tell you what I think of Jesus since I found in him a friend so strong and true I would love to tell you how we changed my life completely he did something that's no other friend could do no one ever cared for me like Jesus there's no other friends so kind as he no wonder else could take the sin and darkness from me oh how much he cared for me [Music] all my life was full of sin when Jesus found me tell us the truth y'all [Music] a misery and whoa Jesus place is loving arms all around me [Music] and he led me in the way I ought to go [Music] no one ever cared for me like Jesus there's no other friends so kind as he [Music] he no one else and darkness around me [Music] oh how much he cares care for me every day he comes to me with new assurance more and more I understand his words of Love Yes Lord but I'll never know just why he came to save me till someday as he is [Laughter] the truth y'all I want my girls to know him I want my children to know him that those would truly save me I don't want him to go through all the trials there's no need this is no need and what they're suffering there's no need it will cost you it will cost you you will pay in some way so I just beseech you all just to press on with him [Music] no one ever cared for me like Jesus [Music] there's no other friends so kind as he [Music] he no one else can take the sin and darkness from me oh how much he cared for me [Applause] but you know it was even better when she stuck her testimony into that right when you plug yourself into these songs is what they don't just write them in fill up paper it's got to mean something and when they got the inspiration to write it God was telling that writer to put it on paper so that sister Alicia can sing it today that's the way I see the thing the the inspiration that's why I like specials because it comes from your heart not everybody's saying and it comes from your heart it's a special God put on your heart to sing to the people well that thought was before the foundation of the world Amen we thank all ever we always think brother John the preacher the preacher preaching is number one we know that but thank God for inspired songwriters like we were talking about John and Charles Wesley Charles Wesley you know John Wesley was a messenger to the church age but Charles Wesley wrote 6 000 songs and they weren't Boogie Woogie for those of you that know what Boogie Woogie is that's rock music and all that other stuff no he wrote 6 000 songs that you and I can connect to God with amen through song that's why David the psalmist David was a man after God's Own Heart because he sang and those evil spirits would just go away from you'll try that sometime have a bad have a bad day start singing don't sing what you heard on the on the Walmart uh no not on the Walmart speakers seeing what God gives you in your heart amen well let's let's have a different type of worship now let's let's listen to the word of the Lord as brother Daryl

just changed his mask you know here not long ago when we was all wearing masks I had traveled somewhere to preach I stopped in to get something to drink and I was standing there next to the Tater chips and this guy comes walking in he must have been a local and the lady behind the cash register she she looked at him when she comes in she does it a double take she goes why John you've changed your mask in which she said when she said that I about shouted past the potato chips because I just called a revelation I thought that's exactly right he's just changed his mask the same God that was in Jesus the groom is now in his bride making himself the same yesterday today and forever what a privilege it is to know the truth amen when we're living in a time when nobody knows what to believe no more CNN says Fox is wrong fox says CNN's line and oh my but I'm so glad that we don't have Fox News but we got the good news amen and we can look in the back of the book and we find out we win we win amen we need to fight with that revelation that we win is that right you know when I was in the Army many many years ago I was up at Fort Bragg with the 18th Airborne Corps up there as Airborne artillery and it gave me a steel pot they gave me an M16 rifle that gave me a m203 grenade launcher that was mounted underneath my 16 they gave me combat boots they gave me a backpack they gave me all this stuff to fight with but they never gave me a promise that I would win no they didn't they said go in there you know good luck but in God's Army he gave us the helmet of salvation amen he shot her feet with the preparation of the gospel and he gave us the promise we win praise the lord well if you have your Bibles to see the true words of the book of Matthews want to read from Matthews chapter 27 starting at verse 15. we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus and I was supposed to be in the Nicaragua Nicaragua meetings myself this year but my wife was in an automobile accident and totaled the car and she suffered a concussion and some some back injury and I just I just couldn't leave My Little Queen so uh so we uh canceled and didn't go but I heard the meetings was really good and we're just just grateful for those that were able to go and if you've never been there it is a humbling experience just precious precious people you know barbam said about the Spanish people said they get their healing because they're willing to eat the crumbs and just just a real humble people that that would have been my 15th trip I think a guy or two Nicaragua but I've been there with brother Louise before just really good people there and I'm sorry we couldn't get to go but I've certainly heard some good reports from the meeting so we're thankful for that I want to read now from Matthew chapter 27 starting at verse 15 and I know I spit a little bit when I preached but I didn't realize I spit that bad everybody's sitting towards the back so but I'll try to watch it y'all move a little bit closer in the morning and I'll try to watch it I'm not just kidding just Matthew 27 starting at 15. do you love him the Bible says this now at the feast the governor was want to release unto the people a prisoner whom they would and they had then a noble prisoner called Barabbas and therefore when they were gathered together pilate said unto them whom were ye that I release unto you Barabbas or Jesus which is called Christ for he knew that for Envy they had delivered him and when he was set down on the Judgment seat his wife said unto him saying how thou nothing to do with this just man for I've suffered many things this day in a dream because of him but the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitude be careful who persuades you the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas and Destroy Jesus and the governor answered and said unto them whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you and they said Barabbas and pilate said unto them what shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ and they all said unto him let him be crucified and the governor said why what evil hath he done but they cried out the more saying let him be crucified and when pilate saw that he could Prevail nothing but rather atonement was made and he took water and washed his hands before the multitude saying I am innocent of the blood of this just person but you see the prophet taught us the only way to get his blood off of your hands is to receive it into your heart I'm innocent of the blood of this just person see you to it then answered all the people and said his blood be on us and on our children then released he Barabbas unto them and when he had scourged Jesus he delivered him to be crucified let us bow our heads I want to speak to you for a few minutes this evening on release the prisoner Heavenly Father Lord as we bow our heads before you we are so grateful dear God for your word and Lord that it's not just letter only but there's a life behind the word and Lord that your word can still speak to our hearts Lord and change the condition of people's lives and Lord I pray this afternoon as we've gathered here Lord with these young people the father may be something be said that would encourage them Lord to look to see Lord that a way of Escape has been provided for David said unto our God belongs the issue from death and that word means the Escape you are the Escape Route Lord the exit door out of here we are so grateful Lord in such a Troublesome time when men's hearts are continually evil yet Lord your word will prevail and I pray dear Lord may you receive honor and Glory unto yourself father God if this whole Gathering to this week and would be for the sake of one's soul may your word touch that Soul this day I pray heal our sick Lord and encourage those that are discouraged set the prisoner free granted Lord for we ask these things in Jesus name and the bride says God bless you may be seated amen as our scriptures open this afternoon we find ourself in a Roman prison house now come with me for just a few minutes in your mind let's take this little trip back to this Roman prison and as we make our way down the hall of this pest House of a prison we come to realize that we are making our way down death row that these are the cells of the prisoners of Rome who have been sentenced to death for their crimes against Rome can you imagine the smell the the unsanitary conditions and the the the the rats and no good food and no good water because after all these men are condemned to death so there's no use to try to preserve their life when they've been condemned to die but let me say this afternoon that every person born on this Earth was born under a sentence of death we were if you will we were born on death row for David said behold I was shaped in iniquity and did an incended my mother conceive me from the moment that we were conceived we are on our path to death you know many people today they have this idea I don't need nobody I don't need no friends I I don't need no help I'm doing all right by myself I'm I'm smart and I I've got money and I can figure it out and I can make my own way but you see the prophet of God said you were born defeated and that birth can never bring you to life people strive so hard to be famous or to be popular or to be a movie star but nine times out of ten most of those people end up with their lives destroyed Katie Spade that people spends thousands of dollars to buy a Katie Spade purse what did Katie Spade do hang herself in a hotel room Robin Williams a comedian that made everybody laugh and everybody what did he do hung himself in a hotel room because we're born defeated and there's nothing that we can ever do within ourself that would ever bring us to life the prophet said you're in a defeated World amongst defeated people amongst defeated Creeds and defeated denominations but you've got to come to Victory somehow and before there could ever be a victory there must be a Victor but you see man was not born that way man was meant to be born free but now we find them that these men here on death row that they have been sentenced to die by crucifixion one of the most horrible forms of death that there were right oh friends it's terrible what sin can do to you you know brother man talked about the eagle that was in a cage and they said that eagle had just been captured and it was one of the most pitiful sights that I ever had the privilege of seeing he said that great Heavenly bird had been captured and netted by someone and thrown into a cage and that poor fellow was so out of place that he would jump with all with that was within him against those big bars flopping his wings only to find himself to fall back on his back and he said then that poor Eagle had beat himself against those bars until all of his feathers was beat off from his wings and his head and his face was bruised and he said I watched him again proudly walked back and with all that was in he report himself against the bars only to find himself not backwards again but he said that eagle he wouldn't quit because he was out of place he didn't blow over he wanted to be free he was born to be free there was something in him that told him this ain't who you really are right oh my saints of God let me say this afternoon I'm not going to quit if I get knocked down I'm going to get back up if I fail I'm going to ask forgiveness but I'm not going to quit because I don't belong here I come from somewhere else amen I come from God I must go back to God [Applause] prophes Tennessee laid there on that floor in those weary eyes soared the skies he said I thought what a pitiful sight made not to be on the earth here he's a Heavenly bird his whole makeup was to live in the blue way above the honks and the cares of this world but to see a bird like that that was made up borned into Earth to soar the skies yet caged in such a way that it could never soar the skies again a prisoner and a man made cage a prisoner and the prophet said as he laid there looking at that place where he had been made born to soar he would not give up because something inside of him kept telling him I don't belong here maybe you're sitting here this afternoon you're singing the songs and you with the song service and you as a part of it and singing the songs and you're looking at a place and something in your heart is telling you this is where you belong this is where you belong maybe you've never surrendered to God in your life and maybe you've just been but something you keep hearing the songs and the testimonies and the sisters he poured out our heart and something keeps telling you this is where I belong this is what I'm missing in my life in that ego you know you know this this is not where I belong this is not what I was born to be but by the cunniness of man this ego had been cased for life and the promise said what a pitiful sight it is but I tell you something friends something more pitiful than that is to see men and women who were born and shaped in the image of God to be Sons and Daughters of God to be find them caged by sin and habits and the cares of this world I'm not talking about just the ones out there in the bar room I'm talking about the ones that set Among Us on message views and yet they're still caged it's far more pitiful than that eagle man was not made to be bound man is a free man whom the son hath made free it's free indeed man doesn't have to be bound like that oh my the different things that cages men and deny them of their god-given privileges man-made man made in the image of his God it doesn't have to be us it doesn't have to be bound a slave to Satan he wasn't made to be a Slave it was made to be a Son of God God made man in his own image amen as we move down this Hall we come to sell number five now this cell belongs to the most feared probably the meanest man in the region his name is Barabbas is actually his name is Jesus Barabbas which means Barabbas means son of the father this man was a murderer he was a thief he was a credible but all of his meanness and his evilness had caught up with him and now he was going to pay the price and let me say young people you may think you're getting away with it you may think that what you're doing that nobody knows that you're doing it but I want you to understand this afternoon there is an All-Seeing Eye watching every one of us and there is a payday that's coming for being assured if we sow it we will also reap it amen this man Barabbas who had brought such fear upon the people when you mentioned his name people were scared to death of the name of Barabbas but this man who had brought such fear and such distress now he was feeling it himself the prophet said all night long he walked up and down that jail pulling his hair for the next morning he would go to a cross capital punishment he would die and have the nightmares passed over him that night and how he couldn't rest knowing the agony and the pain that he would soon face death by crucifixion you see where sin had brought him to that's what sin had brought him to oh he thought he's having him a big time when he was doing it reaping the benefits of his evilness but now and at all up to him and the one who had brought such fear was now experiencing fear himself you know that was in Matamoras Mexico a sister there had a young boy raised in a message Church but he wanted to be a part of this cartel so he left the message Church to follow this this idea of being a gangster but all this gangster caught up with him because the boy disappeared and his mother salt and salt and salt to find out what happened to her son who went to a message search his grandfather was the pastor of the church and finally she got word from the cartel do not look for your son there is no body for we bear we we put him in a barrel of acid and this there is nobody because she asked him if he would just give me my son's body that I could bury him and finally after all these months of Wayland And they said word do not look for your son there is no body so all of his desire to be a gangster look what his gangster brought him and that's where we find barabba smell it had all caught up with him and let me say this afternoon that there is in this building a thief but this thief he doesn't want your iPhone you don't have to pull it up close to you you don't want it he's got one he don't want your credit card he wants your soul he wants to rob you of every Redemptive blessing that Christ died for you to have amen you saw brother down he won't come for me I'm young I'm only eight I'm ten I'm 11. I'm seven he won't come for me but I want you to understand this afternoon he will come oh he won't come for me yes he will come from you Jesus said the thief cometh he wants to rob you his desire is to lock you up in a prison house he wants to lock you up in a cell he'll give you drugs he'll give you Fashions he'll give you popularity he'll give you sex before marriage he'll make it look so invitive he wants to bring the sentence of death to manifestation in your life that's his desire amen and he's here to do that we are guilty by our birth and sin shaped in iniquity that price must be paid amen and so he this this thief Satan he will make it whatever it is because Europe may be different from there yet but whatever it is he'll make it look so fun he'll spin his wealth on you until he gets you caught up with a habit of cigarettes or drugs or alcohol or video games an addiction is an addiction no matter what the addiction is are you listening to me he wants to rob you of your

you've done in your past maybe you made a mistake we've all made mistakes amen every one of us from the pulpit to the back door we've all made mistakes but once they're confessed and dipped in the bleach of the blood God doesn't even remember that you've done it but Satan wants to hold you in a prison house because you made a mistake when you was young Bound by habits until he has you so locked up there seems No Way Out so you set like you're dead on the Pew because you think nothing that's preached nothing that's no special no testimony that's none of it's for you because you are done with

cut your own flesh to venture anger he'll use fashion peer pressure he'll tell you slim is beautiful until he locks you away in a prison House of bulimia you know what believe me is it's where you eat your food and you throw it back up because you don't want to get fat and what does Satan do he puts these women on these magazines it makes them look so beautiful so slim but you don't realize that's photoshopped they don't even look like that come on Friends but it'll tell you that's where you need to look you want to be popular you got to look like that you got to dress like that you're gonna

House of hell he'll rip your parents marriage apart and tell you it's your fault that they split and you live in a guilt of something that you had nothing to do with closing a prison House of fear fear of missing the Rapture fear nervousness a fear of not being popular a fear of not being wanted not being pretty fear of not fitting in what is it all prison houses of Satan but let me tell you young people God made you the way he wanted you Hallelujah he's a god of variety amen tell you God don't care for you you send away your day of Grace what is it Satan holding God's children and bondage held down locked up to it seems like there's no way out just like Barabbas here he is now held in a Roman prison pacing the floor knowing the prophet said that in the next morning no breakfast or nothing knowing that his blood would be strung out like among the wolves and all that we'll see here's chains rattling Prophet said trampling of the soldiers Here Comes four or five maybe a battalion of Roman soldiers and Spirits glittering walking up there in that big Jailer turns the key says Barabbas walk out so you think he felt that morning when you heard the Romans coming with those big galleries the Big Iron shoes are stopping along chains around the spirits dragging on the street to know he's going to be killed when he opened up the doors Barabbas trembled and cried ready to run saying this is the end of me and now we seem are you still with me and now you see we see here Jesus we see pilate Jesus is on the right hand the rabbits on Pilots left standing before the people knowing that the Jews would release one pilate says who do you want on one hand was Barabbas a thief a murderer a liar evil in his flesh he wasn't accused of this that's who he actually was he wasn't falsely accused he was guilty he knew he was guilty and on the other hand was Jesus the son of God the Holy One the Messiah one who done nothing but evil and one who'd done nothing but good healed the sick raised the dead there was no comparison the crowd Cries Out Barabbas give us Barabbas what shall I do with Jesus called the Christ crucify him they were crying for his blood but little did they know that's exactly what they needed they didn't realize it maybe you fail to realize the thing you need the thing you need to make your life complete is in this building right now release the prisoner release the prisoner release Barabbas give us Barabbas and Jesus stood there oh I can see it in my mind Jesus stood there silently for he knew the will of the father he knew the father's will he said father let them have Barabbas for Jesus knew that's our sister sunk there is no friend like the lovely Jesus he stood there silent his father give them the rabbits because he knew the father would have to treat Jesus like Barabbas so he could treat Barabbas like Jesus he became me that I might become him by grace you see Barabbas story was the people that made him free he thought it was the will of the people that set him free and let me save this nation it's been upon liberty and justice for all and in their desire to be free they are more bound than ever listen to me there is no law there is no law made by man that will ever make us free amen no no Barabbas no it wasn't the people that set you free it was the love of God that set him free for you see Jesus was the very Heart Of God expressed you see when I look at this story as that pondered in him was was was writing some of these notes out and was looking at this I come to realize who Barabbas son of the father who that really is it's me it's you it's us while we were yet sinners Christ died for us [Music] I should have stood there on that platform in my sins and my guilt and my failures I condemned prisoner Chained and Shackled by Satan caught up in his wealth Guilty by birth but Jesus said take me take me let Daryl go let wait go son of the father son of the father let him go let the prisoner go and the Bible says they took him Jesus they took him to Calvary and there they crucified him and in his dying minutes minutes his life leaving his body and the pain was so great he cried out either my God my God why is Thou forsaken me you pushed up on the cross and he cried with a loud voice it is finished and done in hell I could just say oh you got him boss you got him ain't nobody die like that I couldn't have been him I'm telling you we've gone my you're Victorious you've stopped him got him boss all at once he heard Satan says to one of the Demons open the door and see who that is and the demon said it's your house you open the door if he goes to the doors he opened the door that's to Jesus well I see you finally arrived welcome oh he didn't want him down there look what a bluff he is and well no you don't want no part of him for what purpose you put fear and chills over the people long enough but I've come down to take over amen I am the Virgin born son of God Satan said I'm gonna write Adam sinned but Jesus said my blood is still wet on the cross and God paid the price for the sin yes sir and I've come to take over give me the keys to death in hell oh Hallelujah slapped him threw him back in there get back at her where you belong rip the keys off of his side oh my God it's a much blood has been shed for the remission of sins and for their sickness and you can't keep them any longer there will be a people who will believe me and you can't bind them any longer with sickness you can't bind them with fear for they will believe me Hallelujah for I have the keys of death and Hell oh my God unto every one of us has given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ forfore he saith when he ascended upon high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto man at that moment friends let me listen to me every prison door every chain door every prison House Began to burst open every cell block that Satan had to lots and to bind Humanity Christ opened up the prison house and said release the prisoners and I say to you this afternoon if you can receive what he did for you you are part of amen and your prison house has been opened I wonder if we could see what barabba saw someone taking her place he was wounded for our transgressions boots for iniquity the chastisements of a peace was upon him and with his stripes I was healed amen we the guilty ones who should be sick can you see him as your deliverer you should go to hell see him in your freedom your path to Heaven I wonder if you could see what barabba saw on that day what did he see someone taking his place let's say friends if you were in a prison House of Satan I don't care what you've done if you're ready if you'll take the step this evening you are free Christ has liberated the prison house you say I'm lost as a coin and a sandpile but you don't have to be the prophet said there's someone standing present right now oh my there is someone standing present right now that'll find you the moment you want to be found feel accepted friends your prison door is opened if you believe me you can step out you can step out well brother I've done this I don't care what you've done the blood of the Lamb of God has freed us of our history because our mistakes of our failures of our besetting sins of our habits come on somebody whatever you're battling in your life well I was in I was in Alaska tback Alaska a few years ago there's a young girl they're 21 year old she come up to me she said brother Darryl I'm an alcoholic I've tried everything to quit drinking she said I've been through the nine-step program three different times she said I cannot stop drinking she said I'll go for a while and then I fall right back into it I've got a young child I don't even know who the father is because I was drunk and I said you know what I do if I was you sis I would lay that alcohol at the altar right and I would take my freedom in Christ you lay it down and accept what it for you and I begin to pray for that young girl I'll never forget it she began to scream to the top of her lungs I'm free I'm free I'm free Hallelujah and I was up there just the other night not long ago and she came up to me and she said brother Daryl I've been sober for two years why because whom the son hath made free is free indeed [Applause] if he can do that in Alaska he could do that in Lula Georgia this afternoon whatever it is whether it's sickness fear oppression depression you can go free he's opened the prison house amen and you this afternoon I don't care if you're eight or eighty you can go free or you can close the door stay in your cell net pastels and that coldness of fear isolation or you can go free the door's been open well if he would only do it he's already done it you just have to receive it you know I was eating in the restaurant the other day I'm closing I was in a restaurant the other day the waitress come up to me and said with my family said is there anything else you want I said no ma'am that's that's fine I said if you'll just bring the check she said your check has been took care of I said excuse me she said somebody saw you in here and they wanted to buy your meal said I said well let me give you she said the tip they even gave me a tip now I could have done one or two things I could have argued with her are you sure it's me maybe it's that table over there you're talking about her yeah I didn't see nobody in here that that knew me you are you sure it's me are you sure but maybe I better go ahead and pay it because I'll go out that door and you'll you'll say I'll try to steal a meal I could have sat there and argued just like some of you argue with him or I could have received what was done for me and walk out with a free meal you can receive what he's done for you and walk out with a free meal and that pizza will taste a whole lot better when the chains of your enemy is off of you to be Unshackled I wonder if we can see what Barabbas saw someone taking their place think about it can we come this afternoon on the basis of what Christ's done for me just do like that young girl give him your shame give him your pain give him your weakness give him your sin give him your habit give him your fear give him your depression give it to you and walk away free for he said release the prisoner let the son of the father go free amen he took our place he went from the cross to the Grave from the grave to the sky and he said where I am there shall you be also the prison doors are open for it you can step out this afternoon you see Jesus was the conduit he was the channel that brought the son back to the father do you love him let us power us oh Heavenly Father thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord what a friend we have in Jesus where no one could help me when I couldn't even help myself you've done for me but no other could do oh God maybe Satan's been lying to some of these young people maybe they've been coming to this church just sitting on the people they feel like they don't fit in they don't belong because Satan has told him it's not for you you're not one of them or maybe they've looked at some of the lies that's been posted on the internet and it's confused their minds Satan trying to lock them up in a prison House of confusion or whatever it would be Lord we spoke of many different things but maybe something here that someone's dealing with that wasn't a Spoke but Lord may they realize even though I wasn't spoke they can still go free from that Lord For Whom the son is made free is free indeed oh Father may we realize May each of us realize Lord that Barabbas it's me son of the father and oh God I prayed this afternoon let there be one Lord who could step out free in these meetings have not been invading Lord God you see the needs of your people the congregation decides Lord no doubt there's many needs some sick Lord some battling different things cancers Lord whatever it would be I I don't know Lord but you know every person here and I pray in the name of Jesus by the same anointing that raised my Lord from the grave may it move upon each heart and upon each home Lord granted this afternoon I pray father God in Jesus name whatever heads bowed just a moment not to point you out friend I would never do that but if you're here and you believe that God sent this message for you and maybe you're dealing with things your parents don't even know your brothers and sisters don't know your husband your wife nobody knows but you that this message just spoke to you and you believe the report you know I I don't know what Barabbas done I I've looked at different places I've never really found out what Barabbas done with this freedom but I want to ask you this afternoon what are you going to do with your freedom that's already been given to you we'll accept it or will you close the prison door and stay because you see anytime you come to a service the prophet said you will be better or worse off and I say to you don't leave worse the prison door is opened if he'd done it up here in Alaska for that young girl he could do it here in Lula Georgia for you and if you're here I just wonder if you would just slip up to your feet and say would you remember me brother Daryl ah friend I don't need to know he knows he already knows what would you say I want to accept my freedom today Satan's been lying to me I ain't gonna take that lie no more I'm going to stand on the promise of the word would there be one would there be one amen look what he gave you look at the freedom he gave you know why don't you give him your shame why don't you give him your fear why don't you give him that besetting sin and step out free would there be anyone Hallelujah Give Myself Away I Give Myself Away so you will use me I Give Myself Away I give myself away so you when you use me here I am here I stand Lord my life is in your hands Lord I'm longing to see let's stand your desire revealed in me I Give Myself Away I give myself away so you can use me I give myself away I give myself away so you can use me take my heart take my life as a Living Sacrifice all my dreams and all my plans Lord I place them in your hands I Give Myself Away I give myself away so you can use me I Give Myself Away I give myself away so you can use me [Music] Hallelujah that's just

[Music] let's give our brother a good hands he opened his heart out to him now let's open our heart out and praise God that's who he was preaching about he wasn't preaching about himself he was preaching about God I was thinking while he was ministering you know I read you that quote not too long ago where brother Brown said uh sister Alicia was talking about holding yourself that's why that's why your virginity that's why you're that's why it's so important because you take it over to the spiritual part and and listen but there comes one time remember I read the quote brother Brown said you've held yourself all your life all your life you've held yourself you fought off them Devils called boys you thought off all the things to stay pure but there's one day you got to give up what you've been saving all your life when you give it all to your husband [Music] what a special thing so now let's take it over to the spiritual part we've had demons beat on us we've had Devils all over us and we've tried our best to stay the Virgin bride of Jesus Christ but one day folks we got to give it we got to surrender everything we are to our husband he'll never do us wrong he'll never divorce US amen we're the bride we're the reason that he came back on the day of Pentecost was to get a bride ready but have we surrendered all have we went ahead and said Okay God you're my husband I'm giving you everything I got everything I got that's why the song I surrender all that's good but if you're not raising your hand you ain't surrender universal sign of surrender Universal all over the world when you throw both hands up like this you've surrendered now what I tell you if you put one hand behind your back and you surrender like this no you might get shot because you can use this hand to get whatever gun knife whatever but when you got both hands up in the air there's nothing you can do so that's what we're going to do today we're going to give our all like that sign says back there and that brother Daryl preached that sermon years ago about giving our All to Jesus Christ and that's why it's on that door back there as you walk in he's talking about the football team you know saying that we give today we give all the Tennessee football he had been down there and looked in the stadium and they hit it they hit the door every time they go out have you give your all today if they can do it out in the world and act crazy jump up and down shout and scream for their favorite team I think we ought to do the same thing for our favorite team amen team Jesus amen team Jesus will never let he'll never lose yeah you ain't got to look for the score it's already done he wanted Calvary but thank God there was a Barabbas because it proved who Jesus was right it proved who Jesus was it proved that somebody had to take my place so that I could go free right Hey listen the crowd they hated Jesus they gonna hate you they wanted Barabbas they wanted a thief and a liar that's what same thing in the world all you young people they love you out there why they love you out there because you just like them but when you make a stand for God when you surrender yourself to him you become real odd to the world because the world will surrender themselves to drugs alcohol all the different things of the world but if you surrender today you surrender all to Jesus Christ you'll never lose and he said I'll never leave you he said I never forsake Him we've had a good time just getting started everything's all good good to see everybody here again and and God bless you

dismiss it was I was uh I'm watching online somebody wasn't even a message preacher oh good grief but you know I always wondered why the prodigal son's father ran to him the Bible tells us when he sees when he sees them when he sees his son he runs to him you know why now that's not in the Bible but Jewish tradition tells us or told that person that done some study the reason the father had to run to the gates of the city to get the sun before the sun entered into the into the city was that under Jewish tradition if you got an inheritance and you wasted it on Gentile righteous living you know he went out he got rid of all his money and he bought and sold and got all kind of stuff and got in a bad way but you couldn't come back in the city they'd Stone you so the father the father knew that right and before the devil the people of the because see if he didn't let that guy walk on him if he'd let his son walk on it doesn't matter son or not they could have stoned him they could have killed him but he went out remember put the code around him he said welcome home right in other words I'm going to take your shame and I'm going to bring you back into where you're supposed to be well praise God if that didn't if that didn't help you it sure helped me amen I always wonder why he ran out sure you know you're happy and but why couldn't the guy you know the son come no he had to go get him right he had to go protect him as we were talking as brother Dale was talking about Jesus looked over and he said in his in his mind he said Barabbas I Gotta Die For You I'm gonna die for you this day I'm gonna die I'm going to take your place and if he would accept in Jesus Christ you know what he would have been a Christian but he didn't we know what happened or we don't know what
