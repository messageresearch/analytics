light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing [Music] you are holy [Music] amen you want to see him tonight wherever you are at home looking in watching in here tonight we want to see the lord and there's one way to see him is by the opening of the word let's go to second corinthians chapter 4 verses 1 to 6. and before we get into the word let's just go right to the lord in prayer well god we thank you so much for being able to gather here tonight lord we're gathered around the word even though all of us aren't here in one physical location lord and we know lord the devil tries to prevent things and hinder and cause all kinds of distress in the world but there's one thing that we have constant confidence in and that's the power of the revealed word and that reveal word is still just as powerful today because you're still the same yesterday today and forever you're still moving in your people just the same as you have for the last two thousand years and on before that all through the all through the scripture lord god you're still the same today lord jesus and we believe it lord god and i pray lord that you'll help something to be said tonight lord that we'll quicken lord and strengthen and help help us on our journey lord god in these and this time lord jesus that we're living in to draw closer to you lord god we pray granted lord that you'll just give your blessing to the service lord here and in all the people's homes that are watching in all all around the world lord we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ we ask this blessing amen so i want to speak tonight on a little topic that i kind of been studying on the last few days called the age of deception because of course this is the most deceiving age there is that brother brown told us about and how everything just kind of winds up in this age to be so deceiving that people people are caught up in this deception well let me let me not get into preaching yet let's read the scripture and then we'll get to talking about it ii second corinthians chapter four verse one to six says therefore seeing we have this ministry as if we have received mercy we faint not but ever announce the hidden things of dishonesty not walking and crafting us nor handling the word of god deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of god but if our gospel be here that is hid to them that are lost in whom the god of this world hath blinded the the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine unto them for we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord and ourselves your servants for jesus satan for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ you can be seated there is a lot packed into that little scripture yeah first of all it talks about in in verse two you if you want to just kind of leave that up just for a second i just just kind of walk through this scripture a little bit and verse two it talks about how how that we're not talking about things in craftiness we're not walking in craftiness and we're not handling the word deceitfully and our gospel in verse three is not hid it's not declared in some kind of in other words we're not trying to trap people into this and i think maybe maybe in the past sometimes the word is it has been preached maybe deceitfully or craftily or whatever but the word can be the the gospel that we have is is a gospel that can be declared openly and plainly from the beginning of the end especially now with the truth that we have we have the liberty to be able to preach the end from the end of the beginning the beginning to the end even into the depths of the symbol symbols in the book of revelation and the seals and all those things and what they mean they could be declared openly and by that declaring those things openly you can see that the devil has blinded the people's eyes to the truth in this age and this this is the age where god has just pulled out all of the stops and given us every ammunition everything we have need of to combat the devil and and and the devil is rising up to blind the world to the truth to blind people to the truth so let's see what he says in verse 4 in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine unto them and verse 6 for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god and the face of jesus christ so when darkness comes god will raise up a standard and the standard is his word and he gives us his word to shine a light in a dark place to give us a way away and a reason to walk a a way to know the hour and the place that we're living in now now maybe just to kind of start things off i want to just read this quote from brother branham and the god of this evil age where he just kind of set the the stage as he was delivering that message he said i'd be a hypocrite to try to bring something that i know that you would be pleased with and it'd be against god's word or something to draw a crowd or something like that i i wouldn't be what i'm here to be a minister of christ i want to bring something that is a vital use to you not just to be seen but to think it's something that if i die today tomorrow it'll be anchored in your heart to go on and serve god amen so i want to just read that tonight to just kind of echo that sentiment that you know you know we really when you when you think about what the gospel is the gospel is not something to just to like brother what brother louise was preaching on sunday it's not just something for us to have a club that we join and that we're all part of a big a big movement movement or anything but it's something that we're actually trying to get out of here and when you you me and zach we're talking on the way over here when you're when you're born again you begin to see things for as they truly are and you begin to look around the things that are taken on the earth the place in the earth and the way that people are and really our desire your desire becomes that i want to get out of here i want to get out of here at all costs and you see the way that we get out of here the way if you would imagine the uh satan coming in with a bunch of cockroaches and the lights are off and the way to have power over that is by turning on the light that's why that brother brandon preached that sermon there's a man here that can turn on the light when he was down in that in that cave out west and he said there's a man here the man that can turn on the light is jesus christ and he does it by the word so the gospel is not hid satan is blind to the eyes of the unbeliever the light of god's word has shined in our hearts again i'm going to be maybe quoting brother louise he was he preached that excellent sermon about how the light shone in the days of creation the light was turned on and it and it began to uh shine on the earth just as the light when it's turned on in your heart shines and begins to show show the word so that you you read the bible with new eyesight it begins you begin to be able to see how you're supposed to be walking and the light exposes satan now now really the the one thing that really got me reading the message to god of this evil age is because i've really been going back and reading through all the the sermons that uh on the seals that sister chris christine transcribed and it really and which is a great blessing if you haven't taken advantage of that uh you know i i sometimes i profit a lot more from just being able to read almost then from listening but when you can read and just really digest and get in there and things i i sometimes can really begin to open up so if you haven't already uh seek that out and see if you can take advantage of that but some things just i believe just began to open up to me that i had not seen before and and one of those things i believe that's revealed in the seals is what the devil is doing and how to combat that so if you go back to uh if you go into the book of james chapter 1 verse 14 to 15 it starts james kind of lays out the path of how the the the workings of the devil proceed from just like a little small little thing and it and it unfolds into a greater and greater thing and because james in first in chapter one he says but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death so it starts off with just a little temptation it seems like a little innocuous just a little temptation a man turns his head looks at a woman or all these different stories maybe that you can relate in your own life a man wants to go witness to a woman at work and he goes and sits down with her at a cafe and they have a little cup of coffee and before long they're they're committing adultery and then one thing leads to another and all of a sudden death is at the door and you see that's how i i i believe that that is the thing that's being revealed in the seals is what the devil is doing as as he starts off with just a little saying and works on his way to a doctrine that kills you and on and on until death is at the door but you see god has given something to combat that and that's why those are called the combat combat beasts he's given you his word to combat the the workings of the devil the work the word the word is the thing that will combat the devil in your life as you go through those different phases of your of your spiritual journey the word is the thing that will bring an end to the to the to the devil in the first seal the devil and the second seal the word is the thing that will bring an end to those things that is the thing that will drive it out so you see you must stay with the word or you'll be living in darkness if you don't stay with the word for your age you'll be living in darkness you know brother brown taught us there was four stages that that through the the the bride tree was restored through luther and wesley and pentecost and through the word now think about that now if you're living if you've if you've come out from denomination and all those kind of things you're still kind of living under the light of a pentecostal age or living under a light of a previous age are you really living in the light of the word if you're not living in in the word for your day then you're still living in gross darkness and i believe that's one of the things that brother brown was really hitting at when he preached this the god of this evil age is if you're not living under the light of the word for your day then you are you are worshiping unknowingly you worship you begin to worship the god of that evil age without even realizing it and you see the devil has got people so duped that they're worshiping him without even realizing what they're doing they sit in church and they think they're right and they think they're they're doing correct and everything but yet they're doing they're worshiping the wrong thing so you see going back to james chapter one every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death so the last thing is death and i believe if you're going to go back and look at the seals that's why the last horse rider his name that sat on him was death so you finish up with the four horse riders and his name is death what is supposed to conquer death the word in you is supposed to conquer death in this age you have the privilege of being one of the five this is that's what is the last this is brother brown said this is the age above all the other ages that i would want to live in this is the age where god has poured out all of his word to give you the ability if you will yield yourself to the word to conquer to overcome death to overcome that last horse rider and first corinthians chapter 15 verse 25 to 26 it says for he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet and the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death you know it's so interesting how when you really begin to study these little messages and really get just almost analyze them line by eye line to see what comes out brother branham says some very interesting things and one of the things i noticed as i was studying this message the god of this evil age is brother he nailed down how a seed man a seed something small a seed planted manifests itself later as as as a mature thing and let's look at how he breaks this down he says as a seed starts in the ground it comes up through carriers the life of it but it ends up the same seed that it was when it went in the ground and the same way the seed listen to these three things that he lays out the same way the seed of deceit fell in the ground in eden is the same way it ends up in the last days the seed of deceit the deceitfulness thinking you're right when you're wrong it's now it's not just a seed though now it's a mature thing that's cloak in the eyes of the people so that they can't see the truth just as the gospel was when it fell to a denomination at nicea rome it ends up in a super organization now see back then and i see rome it was just a seed a little small little thing but now it's a mature thing that's coming forth now the devil is that satan is trying to wind round up all of his body all of his bride as brother brown explains in this message into a one world order a one world system of uh uh uniting church and state and all those kind of things you see it's going from something a little small a little seed to something that's mature just as the seed of the church fell back there with the signs wonders and the living christ among them it ends up in the last days under the ministry of malachi 4 and restores back again the original faith that was once given so there's a seed that was planted on the day of pentecost and in this day it's going to be a mature adult bride a bride that knows what she's doing here and what she's standing for a bride that realizes that she's here in this evil age to prove to the devil that she is not going to fall like eve did you know that is what you are doing here that is what you were predestinated to do to be an example to be a light to the world that to be a light to all of satan's minions all of his kingdom that you are not going to fall that you are going to take all of the word and stand on it now now let's just kind of think for a little bit now if something look real small begins to move into over through process of time into something big from a little baby form to an adult form when's the best time to deal with it you want to nip like brother wade was saying you want to nip it in the bud you want to tackle it early you don't want to wait till it's wait till it's got a crown on his head and it's enthroned and it's sitting up there in the temple of god making it making itself be god you see you don't wait to deal with sin you you deal with sin early on you don't wait to take him at his word take him at his word early as early as you can as soon as you feel the lord dealing with you hear the lord dealing with you through the preaching of the gospel quickly run to the altar run to to take care of the thing and you don't wait to preach that sermon until death is taken over you see we don't wait you you preach that sermon as soon as you see evil the devil moving in a congregation or moving moving in a situation you go ahead and preach that thing as quick as you can because you know if you wait and hope that it'll handle itself the only situations won't handle themselves the only thing that can handle the situation is the word the word is the handler of the devil that might not even be good english but the point the point against the cross you see all all these situations now now brother brother branham when he was when he was preaching this sermon the god of this evil age he began to it started off almost like uh he's he's coming in real nice and everything but then he ramps up and he begins to lay into all of the things that people are doing wrong all the all the all the blindfolds that the devil pulls over your eyes where you begin to think that you're doing right you know and that's another thing that i've really been meditating on is that today of all of all this age of all ages you go on facebook and everybody thinks they're right everybody has all the information all the information that they've got you look at cnn and they think they're right you go on instagram or any of these other social media platforms and everybody thinks they're right any church you go to everybody thinks they're right everybody thinks they're right you so you see you've got all of these voices that you hear of politics and and and the sin in the world and your imagination of your own mind and all these differences of opinion but there's got to be something that's right everyone believes they're right because this is the most evil deceptive age where satan satan has blinded the people to think that they are right now you know that's what eve's eve's problem was was she was deceived but she thought she was right right and there's even a quote where brother ryan said even to this day she still still thinks she's right [Laughter] her her deception was i know i'm right and that's what many people when they go to church they say i y you know they they the devil pulls the blinder over their eyes and they begin to think well i know i'm right to not go to church i know i'm right to dress the way i want to i don't have to dress a certain way i know i'm right i know i'm right to be able to do things contrary to scripture now i'm i'm listening out some things here but just use maybe examine your own self as i'm preaching this because anything contrary to the word anything off of the word will bring death and that's what brother branham was getting at when he when he preached the seals and all these kind of things you get off the word and it will kill you it leads to death i know i'm right to deny what the preacher says i know i'm right that's the worst deception to sit in a church or a congregation or whatever and and believe that you're right despite what the word says amen brother brahms said in in paragraph 97 he said of this message he said notice he preached it in eden to who to adam's bride and she fell for it he deceived her into questioning one of god's words let's see what he might have said he might he must have said it is not scientific to die in this holy church or you will be schooled and educated not to believe in such unreasonable things as death i don't care if god's word did say it it's unreasonable oh look at him today god is a good god you're in his holy church why you cannot die but god said you would and that settles it see him today oh just belong to church it ain't what you do or this that or the other just come to church and be a good member cutting your hair that's nonsense and wearing shorts and putting on paint and going to dances and a little beer once in a while won't hurt you as long as you don't indulge in it my goodness frankly i wish you children would take it so that they could learn whether they liked it or not there he is the god of this age this evil age you see how how he can blind your eyes to think that just whatever you want to do is according to the word of god when it is not this deception is to think that you're doing right when you're not you you can think that as as long as as long as you don't indulge in it it's all right to drink a little beer and all that kind of stuff and now i'm not i'm not i'm trying not to preach a legalistic sermon but you see it goes beyond just closed hair and dress it goes into all facets of the word of god as the deeper you goes the more the devil will attack you on things and and get you to just sit there and say well i know i'm right and when you say i know i'm right and it's contrary to the word of god you can't move forward you can't keep moving on because the bible says in deuteronomy 8 3 he said he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with man in which thou knewest not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord doth man live back there in in the old testament was it written and jesus would quote that a lot and brother branham and all the all of the preachers after you know every we live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god now this is really the only age where every word has just been so unveiled that we can know the name of god we can know how to be baptized we can know how to the all of the mystery part of being born again the mysterious part of justification the mysterious part of sanctification the mysterious part of the holy ghost all of those different kind of things what the true baptism in the holy ghost is what the baptism holy ghost does what the what the true token is that obedient full obedience to the word of god entitles you to the token and so the full word of god is opened up so that you can live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god and if you turn away from that every word every word that we have access to then you're blind and that will produce death it's the word that will defeat the devil you see when when people turn away from the word listen to what brother brown said in paragraph 74 he said notice how beautiful the scriptures tie themselves together in every age when the church world not have the word of god to rule over them they accepted a murderer barabbas what did this do it exalted satan the god of this evil age to the place that he's always wanted now listen for satan is not spoken of as a god of any other age but this age he wasn't spoke of the god of the age of noah he wasn't spoke of the god of age of the age of moses the god of the age of elijah but this evil age oh don't miss it he is the god of this evil aged worshiped by millions and billions of people and they don't know it but let's let the scripture uncover him this morning and let's see then you'll know then you'll know when you when the scripture uncovers the devil and his works then you'll know and you'll know how to how to recognize him and how to defeat him every time through the experience now listen this is one of the scriptures that brother brown read when he was preaching this message matthew 24 24 for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect so this is the age where false christs anointed ones that are anointed but not don't have the word the revelation of the gospel in their soul but yet their anointed on their spirit will rise up and they do signs and wonders now notice how brother branham would explain how to tell you tell by the false teaching by the teaching right now that's that's very plain uh maybe more plain than it should be but people can be anointed in their spirit and and not yet not have the true baptism of the holy ghost down in their soul now now notice brother branham as far as i know there's no place where he said that when someone is anointed or someone jumps up and runs through the building or something like that that there might be a problem with that he never said if someone is anointed that the anoint the absence or presence of the anointing is a problem the absence of presence of the revealed word is the problem i just want to draw your attention to that and really point that out maybe this is a hill that i'm willing to die on is that there's nothing wrong with being anointed and i think sometimes we get in our minds that that if you're anointed there's something wrong there's nothing wrong with feeling the presence of the lord or feeling a blessing or or riding in your car and you get so stimulated by the revelation that you begin to raise your hands up and begin to shout a little bit now i think sometimes that uh you know we get to the place that we we major so much on the revelation of the word that we begin to think of that it's wrong to have any kind of moving in the spirit and and uh y'all just bear with me that but i just i just want to really hit that a little bit there's nothing wrong with an anointing in fact the false anointed ones are both have the anointing the real genuine are also anointing anointed but what the anointing does is it quickens the word that they've held down in their heart and it makes it come alive but the false anointings anointed ones are they're not false because they are anointed but because there's no word to quicken so there's nothing wrong with being anointed now it's not a it's not a badge of honor to say well i've never felt the anointing in my life what kind of badge of honor is that to say that you're so you're so in the word that never from your birth until your adulthood and on beyond that that you've never felt imagi i believe that that the new birth gives us the ability to recognize the presence of god recognize when you're playing a song that he likes recognize when you're reading the scripture and he he identifies you in that scripture and himself in that scripture we we should be able to recognize when god is pleased or dissatisfied with something you know you know you begin to look at uh and i really i had in my notes here to talk about blasphemy because you know when you see the spirit of the lord moving in a situation and you begin to speak out against that that's getting into scary territory that's getting into a place where you know you brother branham warned us against stuff like that blasphemy is to make fun of or ridicule or call the works of the holy spirit the works of the devil so when you see the works of the holy spirit moving in a congregation and doing something and you say something like well i i wonder if like somebody told uh i think it was brother branham told this story that somebody was saying i wonder if john on the isle of patmos had too much spaghetti the night before he fell asleep and had a wild dream well to say something comparable to that after the spirit of god moving in an assembly to speak out against the holy spirit moving that's getting close to blasphemy and i say that because a minister is supposed to warn people like brother louise was preaching about a watchman a watchman is supposed to stand up and say attention attention don't do that you're on dangerous ground and when you begin to not have enough spiritual discernment to speak out against the moving of the spirit that is dangerous ground that you may not be able to recover from brother brown said and jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he said know what a danger lies there let me back up a second he said what did jesus said he said all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven the man that blasphemed the son of man but whosoever shall blaspheme the holy ghost is never forgiven in this world of the world to come and the bible said he said this because they said he has an unclean spirit know what a danger lies there be careful so let's walk humbly see we don't play church no more them days are over we're living in church now he said if you speak a word against the holy ghost it'll never be forgiven you now jesus had not yet been glorified so the blood cell wasn't broke but he was blaspheming jesus and said what is the blasphemy of the holy ghost now is to call the work of god the devil so be careful that's never forgiven nowhere at all never can be forgiven anyone who would declare the works of god to be the devil jesus said that it's never forgiven so be careful how you class god's work fanaticism or mental telepathy or the working of the spiritualists or something like that better be careful but that was their attitude so and i would echo that today to look upon god's work you know we need the baptism of the holy ghost we need the working of the spirit in our lives and we know that what uh activates the spirit or however you would say that is the word that when you hear the word and believe it it allows the spirit to come in and move upon your life to quicken the word and bring it to bring it to pass but many times that process will result in something happen and somebody will shout or somebody will jump or whatever and there is nothing wrong with that in fact we should be desirous to see that i want to see that in my life and many times you know that won't happen because we're so prideful and our hearts are not in the right place to allow the spirit to move we get ourselves so built up in our pride to where if the lord really was moving in our heart we would say well i'm not coming to the altar i'm not going to raise my hands and i can't even clap my hand do you know the reason why you don't clap your hands is because of pride the reason why you can't lift your hands when the spirit is moving is because of pride and the thing that will dash that pride to pieces is the word of god if you can open up your heart and say i'm ready to die to myself if it kills me if it if i have to lay down in front of everybody and act like a fool i'm ready to do it and give my life to god and watch your pride be dashed into pieces now let me get back on my scripture i believe sometimes you got to hit things a little bit hard and i believe i'm sorry i shouldn't apologize i shouldn't apologize for preaching the word but some things some things need to be saying last week in matthew 24 brother brown said it was the most deceiving of all ages all the ages of deceit from the garden of eden all the way down there's never been an age so deceptive as this age false prophets will rise and show signs and wonders if possible to deceive the very elected see now just the cold formal starchy churches and so forth of man-made theology that wouldn't in other words he said that's not going to deceive anybody and it's not going to deceive anybody to have a cold starchy formal church but what will deceive people is to have a church with the spirit moving what i was saying earlier with the anointed ones where the false doctrine is being preached people not understanding how to get born again but yet the spirit is moving people are shouting like like paul said bodily exercise profit of little and what he was speaking of was not going to the gym but he was speaking about jumping up and down that's wonderful but let the word of god be received down in your heart now it sounds like i'm on the other side of the fence doesn't it but you see there's a balance to all things [Laughter] the deception is that it's close the deception is that it's it looks like the real thing it's up there almost like the real thing just leaving out one word is all you have to do promise of the age very great time christians everywhere take heed to the hour we're living in you see this age is the most deceptive of all ages because the devil can make the counterfeit look like the real thing and that's why we need the preaching of the gospel the deep teaching of the word the opening of the seals the seven thunder mysteries which people discount and say we don't need because that is the thing that will give you power to combat the devil that is that is what those combat beasts typify the combat beasts that lion the ox the man and the eagle represent are symbolic of the holy ghost in you the holy ghost in you that combats the satan working in your life brother brown said we find now this evil age is to prove to satan that she is not like eve that she is not that type of a woman and she will be tried by his word the bride as abraham as adam's bride was tried by the word do you know as i was reading through the seals that brother dale preached years ago that's one of the things that he he called out as a as the second seal was open the second seal was a rider on a horse on a horse with a sword and by his false twisted doctrine he brought death to people then what will combat that what would come back that was the sword of the word that sword that fell into brother brethren's hands on the mountain the sword of the word will will combat the false doctrine that satan is sowing satan is bringing death through his false word and god is bringing life through his word that's changing you that's molding you after you get the new birth as you grow up the statue of a perfect man it's molding you and bringing you into his image and this evil age is to prove that you have heard the word and you will not fall because you have become the word see now now is not the time for for fearful hearts and and knocking knees over world events now is the time for confidence in the word that we have heard now is not the time for secret questions in the parking lot about the work the new birth really is and how do i get the new birth and how do i know it and all these things are last-minute explanations about what the message is about now is not the time to get somebody to come over to your house and explain to you all these things that you should have been studying out all these years as the doors are closing in this final hour why did you wait until now now is not the time for last-minute explanations you know think about noah when one morning he looked up he woke up in his bed and he realized that the door was shut and he had nothing to do with the shutting of the door it was god that sealed them in and sealed them out and now all that was left was to preach to the souls that were imprisoned to preach to the lost that had rejected the message oh that's that's just coming fresh i i don't want to believe that the doors are closed but but when the word is rejected when the word is rejected it's getting close it's getting close now [Music] but see as i was looking at studying on the second seal is that the seals if the word is what will change you then one of the things revealed under the second seal is that you also have to stand a test by the word you have to be tested to prove that you will stand according to the word that you will not fall to some sensation or something that you're not relying on having a feeling you're not relying on feeling and anointing all the time well if the spirit of the lord leaves you that you're not trusting in that but you're trusting solely in his word that's the only thing that you could have confidence in not emotions not wonderful church services not all of those things not that somebody not that your best friend believes what you do not that your pastor even believes what you do but that you have heard from that stills fault small voice that elijah heard when he was in that cave you've heard from that same voice that you've seen the same pillar of fire that moses did and you know for yourself whom you believed and you will not fall to anything because you've heard the word that's why the bible says let no man deceive you by any means in second thessalonians chapter 2 let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there cometh falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition except they're coming falling away first now as brother dale often says you've got to have something to fall away from you got to have something to follow and people are not falling away because from a new birth you if you're born again you cannot fall away from the word because the word will keep you you've got the comforter in there but what they're falling away from is the true word of this day being preached we have heard the skies have been opened us the windows of heaven and all the word has been given to us and they're falling away from that because they believed the lie and been given over to that and let's keep reading this who opposeth and exalt us himself above all that is called god that is worship so that he is god sitteth in the temple of god showing himself that he is god and what did brother brown say that that is god what is what is the temple of god what is the tabernacle of god it's supposed to be the new testament tabernacle of god is supposed to be his church it's his bride where he tabernacles himself in you and when the devil comes in and poses and sets himself up in the temple of god he's setting himself up in the church deceiving the people deceiving the people that are supposed to know the truth and he's showing themselves that he is god deceiving the people to worshiping the god of this civil age and to the god that they think that they're worshiping because they've been deceived they've been deceived by not not obeying the word of truth they've turned their back to the truth turn their back to the message of this day and i believe one reason why they've turned their back to the message book is because people have not preached the message people have not told the people what to believe they've not preached it in a way that it should be preached and so it's been made of none of faith that's been watered down so much until it doesn't have any effect anymore the gospel hasn't been preached in just a form where you just kind of you come to church and you join something but there's so much more even than being born again if people would preach it god help me until my dying breath until i'm taking off this world to preach the gospel with everything that's in me and not hold back to preach the truth because the truth is what will set us free you all forgive me for hardly getting the words out let's keep reading what he said remember you not that when i was yet with you i told you these things and know you and now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time for the mystery of iniquity doth already work and only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way and then shall that wicked be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him who's coming is after the working of satan with all powers and signs and lying wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because why why the reason is right here they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved and for this cause god shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie that they all might be damned who believe not the truth but add pleasure in an unrighteousness now let's just let's just bring this home it seems like we can kind of make this especially those of you at home and that are not sitting here in the sanctuary and make it seem like it's talking about just somebody else way out there that we don't have to worry about it's very easy to be judgmental of other people and point fingers at what a group that group over there or people that you know or whatever but let's bring it home tonight and bring it down to our situation have you opened your heart to the message of the day have you opened your heart and spent your time in the message of the day or have you been deceived into thinking that the things that you're doing the way that you're acting that's contrary to the word is the right way and that you know in your heart you've been deceived into thinking that you're right so that you say despite the preaching of the gospel but despite all the things that are said over the pulpit you say in your heart i know that i'm right nobody can tell me that i'm wrong i know that i'm right i can pull my dress up i can cut my hair i can put a tattoo on my face i can paint my lips i can paint my eyes i can do all these things knowing that you're not living according to the scripture and and yet you're deceived i wonder if you could examine your heart tonight and if if you're living in that condition now would be the time to change course and repent and change direction and turn around and come back and go the other way brother brown said see adam's bride believed every bit of the word all but confused on one promise that he's the same yesterday today and forever today see but failed on one promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face but she believed she was right you see that's the deception she believed she was right that you can sit in a church and hear the gospel preached and say i believe that i'm right i know that i'm right do you see why this day this age is the most deceiving of all ages because it will be so close till it would deceive the very elect if it was possible because people will sit in a church next to the elect in the same building with the elect fellowship with the elect and believe that they also are elect when they're deceived be not deceived the bible says that all nations in revelation chapter 18 he says babylon the greatest fallen has fallen and has become the habitation of devils and the whole of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people in other words everybody everybody except the bride has fallen to her deceit has fallen to her deception everybody that except for the real true born-again believer that has grown into maturity that has come to the full stature that has received the word for her day everybody has fallen to that deception because everybody if you don't have the word to combat that if you don't have the combat beast inside of you to combat the deception of the devil you will take the mark of the beast and that's why the bible says that in this day this layout of seeing age it says that because thou sayest i am rich should increase with goods and have need of nothing and know us not that thou art wretched and miserable and but know not they're wretched and poor and miserable and they yet they don't know it because the wool has been pulled over their eyes and blind and naked i counsel thee to buy me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich in white raiment that thou mayest be clothed at that the shame of thy naked nakedness do not appear do you realize why brother branham so awful when it hit on women for not dressing right and hit on men also for not dressing right for not being clothed right because his job as the seventh angel messenger was to clothe the bride of christ to prepare her to adorn her in white raymond so she so that she could be presented spotless without any spot or wrinkle to the bridegroom it was his job to to hit and rebuke and all these things and i say if ministers don't don't continue to hit on that they're not preaching the gospel let me catch my breath here you know what preaching on clothesline exposes the sin-sickness of your soul if your outward adornment is not correct then it shows that on the inside there's something that's wrong something down on the inside if your hair is cut it shows that you're not ahead you're not in headship to authority if you're not dressing right it shows that your soul is not clothed by the word it shows that your eyes have not been opened to your predicament so we preach that and it's scalding and hurtful and everything to clothe yourself with a righteousness so that your outside can be clothed so that your it opens your eyes to your current state i tell you nobody in this message should have a right or an excuse to be clothed improperly to come to to come to the house of the lord and sit in fellowship with other people with their dress above their knees so that it shows their undergarments when you sit wrong you know when you bend over and everybody can see all of your wares and all those kind of things there's no excuse for that because the word of god should have your soul clothed you should be clothed in your right mind if you're if you're not clothed by the word of god you're not even in your right mind and that's why that maniac of goddard took his clothes off because he was not in his right mind i want brother brown said a woman that takes her clothes off clothes off is not in her right mind and he said she's in this message that i'm preaching from the god of this evil age he said she's got a prostitute spirit on her why prostitute spirit because she's wanting men to lust after her you see if you're if if you're not if your soul is not clothed it shows that you're you're it will manifest itself on the outside isaiah chapter 61 verse 10 it says i will greatly rejoice in the lord my soul shall be joyful in my god for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation he hath covered me with a robe of righteousness as a bridegroom decath himself with ornaments and as a bride adorneth herself with jewels so certainly certainly i'm not preaching legalism tonight i'm not preaching by any sense that if you dress right or your hair is the right length that you are saved but it shows if you're not clothed on the outside that something's wrong on the inside and i believe that shall be preached and if it's not preached and ministers are dropping the bar they're letting down the bar on the gospel and you can see it in the way that people are living you can see it in the the the horrible nasty lives of the people that are living that they they've dropped the bar in their own lives because you see the word is what will keep you the word is what will clothe you the word is the only thing that come back can combat satan in the lives of the people in the lives of of this deceptive age i hope that's all right but in another sense i don't really care first timothy chapter four he says for therefore we both love labor and suffer reproach because we trust in the living god who is the savior of all men especially of those that believe in matthew chapter first 16 24 says if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me follow me to suffer the reproach for the gospel gospel to suffer their approach and you realize sisters out there listening in we don't we have one sister here sitting here tonight but sisters when you clothe yourself right you cannot help but suffer reproach because people will mock you and scorn you any person any individual that's living right for the for the gospel will suffer approach a minister that's preaching the true word of god will suffer approach and we were talking privately the other day me and luisa about that that the true that's maybe one of the complexities of being a minister is when you preach the truth when you i really believe that the best sermons are the ones when people when you suffer the most reproach because it'll stir up enmity it'll stir up straight or stir up the devil and when the dead i want to stir up the devil i want somebody to say i i have a reaction i want somebody to either come to the altar and repent or realize they're doing they're living wrong i want something to be stirred up when something is stirred up then you can do something about it when we all when we preach sermons whether we just stroke one another on the back and say just say it's all wonderful and everything then i wonder if how much profit it really does and you can take that for what it's worth but that's that's free brother brown said it has god lost control or is he just permitting another agency to control i wonder the true answer to this question is to my opinion there is two opposing spirits in the world today at work there can't be no more than two two heads and one of them is the holy spirit at work the other one is the spirit of the devil and in this last days in deception now i'm going to base my thoughts right on here for the rest of the text the rest of our message the two spirits one of them god's holy spirit the other one the devil's holy spirit working in deception the people of the earth are now making their choice the holy spirit is here calling out a bride for christ he is doing it by vindicating his word of promise to her for this age showing that it is christ in other words if the finger is moved it's supposed to move in this age the finger will move the foot is supposed to move the foot will move the eyes to see in this age the eye will see see the spirit of god is growed into the full stature of god as the age that we're living in the holy spirit is here vindicating the message of the hour and the holy spirit is doing this so that the people that believe god will be called out of this chaos the devil's unholy spirit is here calling his church by the error as usual by perversion of the word of god like he did at the beginning now now let me just highlight something here brother branham as he's preaching this message he's calling your attention to the fact that there are two spirits and there are two bodies there are two brides and they are both being gathered up together in this day god is gathering up his people by the revealing of his word as he's drawing them together and the devil is gathering up his people together by the perversion by the lie by the deceitfulness he's got drawing them together and the whole process started in similar ways started from a seed like i was saying earlier started from a little thing that seemed insignificant and grew grow and grew grow grew into a mature form in both in both instances and now is everybody doing okay you all right if i get a little bit more deep here everybody doing good i know how when once we go past eight o'clock then kind of the sleepy eyes come on but let's see brother brown explained that satan exalts himself from a child to sitting in the temple from a little childish thing to sitting in the temple to enthroning himself as god of this evil age over the people's hearts to to to to placing himself as as god and he quotes this scripture ephesians chapter two verses one to two and it says and you hath thee quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience and the children of disobedience and if you go run that through the scripture brother brown talks about how it starts off as a little childish thing in other words if you look at the how the first seal opened up as just a saying and it moved from a saying into a doctrine now now there's a comparison to your scriptural journey as well because your scripture your journey as a christian start off with you're hearing about baptism and you're hearing about all these things and and and it it was maybe just like sayings and everything it started off as as you're hearing about the third pool you didn't understand what it was you heard about the third pool and the capstone and adoption and all these kind of things but then moving on to the second stage it began to take a form of a doctrine and it began to solidify into something where god is actually forming himself coming down and making himself manifest in you through the statue of a perfect man he's purging you of those of all the lies of the devil he's molding you into his image and you see you can see brother brown as he preaches this message he's comparing the devil moving down through the seven church not seven church ages but moving down through until he's in his mature form comparing that with on the other side and brother branham he starts talking about he says for as the germ of natural life is brought down dramatized from father to father so was the life of christ dramatized that's the reason god uses elijah spirit five different times what is it it's the handing down he's handing down his spirit from one to the other as it's preached a church aged messenger and he's preached until it comes down to the final age that's been handed down and handed down from one to the other in its mature form listen to this he said children of disobedience and if the antichrist beginning there in the infancy of disobedience what will it be when it heads up in the person of the antichrist how deceptive it'll be how much more powerful deception could an adult give to the world than an infant's child and he said the spirit of delusion now working in the children of disobedient disobedient to the word now i want to dwell on this in just a minute the children of disobedient a child now you see he goes on to describe how in this day it winds up just how it was when the son of man was made manifested on earth in jesus christ they rejected the word in favor of barabbas and it brought their death and now in this day they've rejected the word they rejected the real word and it's elevated he said it exalted satan the god of this evil age to the place that he's always wanted why because they rejected the truth in this age in 2 thessalonians chapter 2 it says even him whose coming is after the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved and brother braham goes on to say he said satan never come out and say oh well that's not even the word of god he admitted it was the word of god but he put his own interpretation to it which god plainly told them not to do it what does this do it makes a strong delusion for the people to believe a lie and be damned by it now now we were some of us were talking about this earlier it's gotten it's so close in this day that you can take snippets of what brother branham said and real snippets from the bible and string them together with the wrong spirit behind them and it will be absolutely wrong you can take scriptures from the bible or quotes from the message and make it look like you're not supposed to be going to church you can make it look like that we're not supposed to be listening to the fivefold ministry you can make it look like all sorts of different things and that's where the deception is it looks like something but without a true true revelation of jesus christ you will fall to that delusion let me let me just kind of skip over some of these things it goes he says the devil believes not make believes but he actually believes that's not he is not saved talking about how you can say well i believe but do you have a revelation do you have the correct revelation but brother brown he goes on to talk about how how that deception is made manifest in people's lives now he's hitting it sounds like he's being legalistic because he's saying satan made it lawful satan's made it lawful to commit sin and because people are deceived they think they're right and sinning so you see now and the way he describes it he says people have legalized drinking they've legalized smoking i'm talking about in the church now they've legalized a woman with short hair legalized shorts and pants and all those things and and just form your own list in your mind legalized everything that's contrary to the word of god but that's why we need traffic cops we need the minister to come on the scene and declare like john the baptist did it's not lawful it's not lawful for you to be married to your brother's wife it's not lawful for you to do those things it's not lawful for you to paint your face it's not lawful like jesus coming around the corner i believe as he did one day and he went into the into his father's house and he saw them making a dent of thieves and he said it's not lawful i i believe that's how ministers are supposed to do is they maybe they come around the corner and all of a sudden they realize the predicament that people are in and it catches them just like jesus did when he turned the corner and saw them selling people in the father's house and he began to take up those that braved those ropes and began to whip the people why because of the thing because of their sin we need traffic cops to declare when we're breaking the law it's not lawful for you to do that it's not lawful for you to to behave yourself in a way that's contrary to the scripture it's not lawful for you to rob the house of god like malaka in malachi chapter 3 it's not lawful for you to rob god and not pay your tithes do you realize when you don't pay your tithes that you're robbing god and if you were in the natural that you would be arrested that's why we need the preaching of the gospel to hold our feet to the fire if you don't pay your tithes that you're robbing god you have no excuse to not pay your tithe despite the predicament that you're in your first obligation is to pay your tithes not because we want a lot of money but because god said it amen and you can get in your head that it's that we don't have to go to church i've seen i've seen so many traffic cops on facebook getting all irate because of what they see their congregations in this particular time getting so laxed and liking staying home and sitting around with her pajamas and their feet up and everything and they cease to have true worship and they're not really entering into worship anymore and the traffic cops are some of them are i was kind of laughing to myself but one brother i saw he's like we're we're done everybody's coming back to church i'm tired of everybody sitting at home with their with their pajamas up in their feet up people are getting lazy and lacks and everything and we're not having this anymore now i'm not saying i'm not proposing any particular change in plan or anything i'm just saying that traffic cops are here to set us straight to keita to hold our feet to the fire and to prevent us from getting slack and lacks and and and and and you know letting the world create encroaching you see well that was white walking a tightrope uh again i'm not i'm not anyway you see satan is satan tells he's he's he's trying to deceive this second bride by telling her all these things that she's doing is fine to do he'll tell her there's no such thing and i wrote down all these things that brother brown said there's no such things as divine healing never been a case proved brother braham said that is one of the things that what the devil will will say to put deceit on you that cloak of deceit to close your eyes to the truth he'll say there's no such thing as the baptism of the holy ghost that was only for the apostles or that divine healing was for another age in other words he's saying there's no such thing let's just stick that on the end of a lot of things that the devil could tell you about the bible there's no such thing as your healing god doesn't want to heal you there's no such thing as the baptism of the holy ghost for you it don't make any difference if you're baptized in the titles of father son and holy ghost it don't make any difference that's another lie that the devil will tell you it doesn't make any difference i just apply that to anything any kind of truth they don't make any difference whether we know the seals or not it don't make any difference whether we understand daniel's 70 weeks it don't make any difference whether we know who was this melchizedek it don't make any difference but it does make a difference it makes just as much a difference as it did how you were baptized it just makes just as much a difference as how you know who the name of jesus christ the name of god it don't make any difference if i trim my hair it don't make any difference if i marry an unbeliever and this is i thought this was striking how much brother branham hid on this in this sermon the god of this evil age that we think it don't make any difference and brother adam said they were never forgiven the sin of the sons of when the sons of god married the daughters of men they were never forgiven that they were never forgiven that when bola balaam came in with that lie and they married the daughters of men why because they thought it didn't make any difference and god never forgave them for that it does make a difference the word makes a difference brother brown said notice the sons of god saw the daughters of men not daughters of god the daughters of men that they were beautiful and they caused the sons of god to fall into this delusion and took them kind of women and married them and it brought a age of prostitution just like it is today like it was in sodom like it's predicted to be today why why did it matter when a son of god marries a daughter of men then poof his homes in disarray they can't they're not walking in one accord when he tries to lay out the true the true meaning of scripture to his family his wife will come in while he's at work and she'll begin to sow discord like brother adam said that i believe those women on the ark caused the serpent seed to be passed down on the ark and the way i believe that they did it is because as soon as noah or any one of those would say the truth they come right behind and say it don't matter it don't matter if you go smooching on a girl it don't matter if you go wearing your clothes like this it doesn't matter it doesn't matter but it does matter it matters who you marry young people i know that's treacherous to hit on that kind of thing and it bruises people a lot of times but yet it's the truth because it matters who you marry it matters it matters what decision you make because down the line down the line if you marry the wrong person it'll make your life a living hell just the same as balaam's teaching that he calls the pretty intellectual scientific women of moab to with their flirty eyes their paints and powders or fine perfumes to entice the sons of god against their own women that worked and had calluses in their hands with no makeup on and tash them over and let us marry one another because we're all the same people that see what the lie of the the deceitfulness of balaam was that we're all the same there's no difference we're just all the same but they weren't all the same and they weren't all the same because they had built their self up into conceit and pridefulness they weren't all the same because god's word said they weren't all the same god's word is what makes us different god's word is what makes us a separated people it's not that we're building ourselves up into some delusion or some pridefulness or whatever but his word has called us to be a separated apart people and if you'll abide by god's word he'll lead you to life everlasting and he'll make he'll give you a peaceful life he'll give you a life where you and your wife can work and walk in one accord i'm sorry if that bruises anybody but if you if you're to stick with god's word then he can patch things up and make make your life a lot easier stay with the word i know i'm stammering and stumbling and everything but the bible says through stammering lips know the tongues see brother brown and i i'll be closing up here in just a few minutes the bible brother ram said that the god of evil of this evil evil age gives people what they want and what they want because they've rejected the truth is a life of sin they want you can see as people leave the message they go right back into the hot tub sitting with bikinis and all kinds of things and what they want is bikinis and beer parties and nightclubs and dances and darkness no light events to keep them out of church oh my now we're getting into now we're getting into homes home territory maybe even when we talk about bikini we go to the beach and we think that we can dress a certain way because we're at the beach and we're out of out of the sight of all the believers but then you know facebook is a great revealer because it uncovers things that people do in secret i i've honestly been quite horrified at a lot of the things that i see show up on facebook that people think is is done in secret and all these kind of things you see what it is is the devil is covering over your mind the reason people do stuff like that is because they think they're right if you go to the beach and you've got a bathing suit on and you're uncovered for all the world to see you're doing that because you think you're right but you're not right and what exposes your error is the word of god and that's why that's why i believe the word has to be preached when a cutting way sometimes it cuts and it hurts feelings and things because it exposes where we're wrong and then we can shape up and see events to keep them out of church if there's something that you're doing on the side to keep you now again we're a lot of us now we're not in church and things we're at home and whatnot but just apply that to the study in the bible or putting god first because if there's anything in your life that you put first before god then that is your god that is your idol that is the thing you worship and that is why he's called the god of this evil age because he's usurped he's put himself in place over god and instead of worshiping god people are worshiping the devil why because they've got all the they'd rather go they'd rather watch a good marvel movie they'd rather watch a movie than go read their bible and they think they're right amen doesn't the scripture say that you if you have if you love the world or the things of this world the love of god's not even in you if you would rather go watch a good marvel movie instead of reading the book of revelation i wonder if the if the love of god is in you and now this is hitting hard and maybe maybe it's getting down to the wire a little bit but listen this is holding down time and we're not here just to play church but we're trying to get out of here we're trying to get rapturing faith and if rapturing faith comes by the opening of the seven seals by the seven thunders which is what brother ram said then shouldn't we be aiming have that as our goal to get into the into those deep things instead of all these things that warp our mind all these websites and things that people get caught up with and listen i know i'm hitting it sounds like i'm hitting legalism a lot and i've heard before people people will say well if a minister really hits on adultery or or pornography or all these kind of things that well that means that that minister's got a problem he's got a secret problem well that if that logic was true then a minister would never be able to preach the word they would never be able to preach the slicing gospel they will never be able to preach it so listen let's not get caught up in the deceitfulness of our minds the imagination of our minds that the devil will put on us but let's just stick straight with the truth of god's word see it uh brother brown i'm talking about how it don't people say it don't hurt my conscience they don't condemn me and they're living in rebellion so deceived the word separates you from the children of disobedience he said oh dear you should do this talking about what people will say oh dear i think you're old foggy preacher down there if you just oh you would look cute in a in a bikini or ever what you call the thing you if you do all this that and the other why a little cigarette won't hurt nobody i belong to church and you know our denomination has looked to looked up to as well as anybody's don't you believe that old painted up liar she is lying to you that's right yes sir and anybody whether it's not an old painted up liar but a preacher with a nice haircut anybody that would tell you anything contrary to the gospel don't listen to that because you will die if you disbelieve one word faith in the full word is what will overcome death faith in the full word is what will overcome that last horse rather named death faith and the full word is what will take us out of here [Music] i've got so many notes i'm i i was listening to brother brown i'm talking about i got six pages i'm gonna skip over and everything sometimes sometimes you do that i'm going to finish up right here and the musician can go ahead and come on he said in ephesians chapter 5 let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things cometh the wrath of god upon the children of disobedience be not ye therefore partakers with them be not ye therefore partakers with them the only way to avoid the fate of the deceived is to get in the word amen the word is what will save us i i i got wrote down here that satan can try to take everything from us but he can't take the power of the word you know as time goes on that might be all all you've got left you maybe the church doors will be closed you might be home wondering where your next meal is going to come the devil can take all you take he can take your money away from you he can take your uh all these things away from you but he can't take the revelation of god's word amen are we happy in the lord tonight let's stand to our feet and just worship the lord a little bit amen these saints of life proclaim jesus [Music] life and mercy in his name jesus the light of the world will walk in life beautiful [Music] shine all around us by day and by night jesus [Music] we're walking in that light send the gospel true to allah then david said his word is a light until my feet are lamp until my path or vice versa his word is what shows us where to go around [Music] jesus the light [Music] [Applause] [Music] jesus the light of the world [Music] shine all around us by day and by night jesus the light of the world amen walk in that light brother braham said you might not be able to see the end where you're going the house at the end of the path but just keep walking in the light of that lamp that lights our way and you'll get to the destination but you know what i believe the light has shown so brightly that now we can see our destination we can see where we're going we're going to a capstone revelation we're coming to the opening of the seals we're coming into the revelation of a body change we're coming to the revelation of what these symbols mean and now we're at the end of the journey where all things are being manifest it's manifesting time and i believe now we're at a place where we should know what we're doing here what are we doing here i believe we're here to prove to the devil that's right that we will not fall all hearts clear everybody all right well i'll i'll turn it over to brother wade for the list here ready may need that oh thank you god bless you good job brother bob hey man good job that was really wonderful very timely very good uh by the way a couple announcements number one um i'm gonna try to get if we can brother joe uh we

sunday afternoon you'll be here you got it okay all right so so i'll be doing sunday morning sunday morning be just like last sunday and then um brother aaron will be one o'clock sunday afternoon so thank you all for being um patient and it's like brother bob said this it's a tough time but you know what i always think about those people that went through the dark ages they had to hide they had to hide we don't have to hide they had to hide to meet and if they were caught meeting it wasn't just a slap on a risk or putting you in the pokey for a couple days no it was instant death but they met anyway they met anyway they didn't care they met so so we're gonna meet hey man and i'm just praying that we can all uh get this thing out of the way mom's feeling much better uh she just has a um maybe a rough time every once in a while now so where it used to be a lot of time but now it's just part of the time so keep praying for them they're going on august the 12th to have their tests done to see if everything's good and okay uh dad's doing fine he is just i don't think he's got i don't think he's got any antibodies in his body i think his whole blood system is just he's just full of the holy ghostly nothing's bothering him he's standing there right there in the middle of that standing right there in the middle of that cove and and nothing's bothering him so um you know i told you you know um god brought the attention of satan to job remember he said you got a hedge around him and then he said well if you lift up that hedge well see he got to all the things around him then the last thing he done he said well you got a hedge around his body he said well you can play with his body he said but you leave his life alone you see all these people in the message though brother howard carroll people like dad keeping away from it but homer longor all these and even even by louie's different ones mom going through this but we're going through it it's not killing us off it's like job he said okay let's see i want to see what your bride will do i want to see what your bride will do god says okay you grab a little flash every once in a while and tickle it a little bit put a virus in there he said but i say when their life ends i say when their life ends satan doesn't do that satan never says i'm gonna take that life not when you're a child of god that's what i was thinking today man we are so blessed to be the children of god to where he doesn't and that you say about god god don't care about nothing but his bride his bride is who he cares about right now because if we don't defeat the devil in our flesh then the whole program's done exactly done for so he's going to because we've already read the book we take a rapture we take a we take a body change so we've already won it's just we got to go through the journey all right go through a little virus here and there we've been through them before so we will make it through this trying time so sunday
