[3:50] 8 and we know that all things work
[3:53] together for good to them that love God
[3:55] to them who are the called according to
[3:57] his purpose for whom he did for know he
[4:00] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[4:02] the image of his son that he might be
[4:05] the firstborn among many Brethren
[4:07] moreover whom he did
[4:09] predestinate them he also called and
[4:11] whom he called them he also Justified
[4:13] and whom he justified them he also
[4:16] glorified P tense P tense Already Done
[4:19] Right what shall we then say to these
[4:24] things if God be for us who can be
[4:27] against us or
[4:30] as we've
[4:31] read in
[4:34] John
[4:36] 6 verse 60 many therefore of his
[4:40] disciples when they heard this said this
[4:42] is a hard saying who can hear it when
[4:45] Jesus knew in himself that the disciples
[4:47] murmured at it he said unto them does
[4:51] this offend you in other words you got
[4:53] problems with what I'm saying what if
[4:56] you what if ye shall see the son of man
[5:00] Ascend up where he
[5:03] was before you know that happened on the
[5:06] Ascension some saw him go up
[5:09] right it is the spirit that
[5:12] quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing
[5:15] the words that I speak unto you they are
[5:18] spirit and they are life you may be
[5:21] seated the Lord that is blessing to the
[5:23] reading of the word now to not spend
[5:27] much time as a background but to
[5:30] make
[5:31] sure that we uh get an understanding and
[5:35] ready to move
[5:36] on
[5:38] uh what is the seed of
[5:41] God it's God's word we know that all
[5:45] right it's the word of God but now is
[5:49] the letter on a
[5:50] page we call that the word of God we say
[5:53] well we've got this Bible this is the
[5:56] word of God all right now
[6:00] that's a
[6:02] truth but is it all the truth about it
[6:05] the what about that word that we hear
[6:09] why does it not
[6:12] produce if it's word and spirit being
[6:16] alive you know why does it not
[6:20] produce now it does you know come on but
[6:23] what has to happen to make it
[6:25] produce God has to come down and Quicken
[6:29] those disciples walked with the word for
[6:33] three and 1/2 years they were already
[6:36] Bible uh
[6:38] studiers you know of the Old Testament
[6:40] Scrolls and things they were already
[6:43] maybe spent their life listening maybe
[6:45] couldn't read it but they had heard
[6:49] it well see then when Jesus began to
[6:52] talk to
[6:55] them they could follow him up to a
[6:57] certain line but then it would just seem
[7:00] like it would go in like it did with
[7:03] with
[7:04] Nicodemus you know he could go up with
[7:06] him for a certain way but then when he
[7:08] said you must be born again then see
[7:11] they it was just something different and
[7:13] as was reading this morning why can't
[7:15] you understand my Speech cuz you don't
[7:18] understand my words all why would it put
[7:21] speech and word in the uh same uh
[7:26] scripture you know if there's not a
[7:29] different thought there in the concept
[7:31] of it that you you can't understand my
[7:36] speech because the word that you have
[7:40] heard has not been quickened to
[7:44] you is that the way of stating it what
[7:47] you've heard has not been quickened it
[7:50] it's still letters on and even though
[7:53] they could walk with
[7:54] Jesus and here personally God speaking
[7:59] to them
[8:01] right still that was not quickened
[8:04] totally to bring a new birth now I told
[8:07] you I'll
[8:09] Min mention this as we go through the
[8:11] series a
[8:12] lot that I'm trying to get us to see
[8:15] what the the the seed of God is because
[8:18] if the prophet would say you're born
[8:20] with a seed in you we want to know what
[8:22] that was that's right well why was it
[8:26] not made alive to their disciples now
[8:29] certain things
[8:32] were right and brother brandom in his
[8:36] reference we will get to
[8:38] it of say like the little woman at the
[8:42] well he will be referencing to her as
[8:46] the seed being
[8:48] there and he'll say that seed Was Made
[8:53] Alive right when she said you know
[8:57] you're the Messiah see it was made alive
[9:01] but that didn't give the new birth
[9:04] amen right and if anything it was going
[9:07] to go with anything you'd say well
[9:08] surely Mary would have been the one when
[9:11] she was the one who carried the very
[9:13] seed to
[9:14] birth to produce
[9:17] Christ but see brother R said
[9:21] Mary had to go to the upper
[9:24] room all right if that seed Was Made
[9:26] Alive to the little woman at the well
[9:29] then why did she need an upper room
[9:33] experience are you with
[9:36] me see then we need to understand so
[9:40] that's what I'm trying to do is lay it
[9:42] down and get it to the point to where
[9:45] that we can see really what is the seed
[9:49] of
[9:50] God so we talked about it this morning
[9:52] as being
[9:54] what it's not letters on a
[9:58] page it's not because you can hold it
[10:01] and I do and cherish it and there are
[10:05] people and I'm not I'm I'm bragging on
[10:07] them all right going off on myself
[10:10] there's people that would not make one
[10:11] mark in a
[10:12] Bible you
[10:14] know right no letters in it no you know
[10:17] no marking no
[10:18] underlining why because they count it
[10:21] the word of God well I'm bragging on
[10:23] them all right I'm not derogatory to
[10:26] them but you see I want to know what
[10:30] it's talking
[10:31] about and I want to
[10:34] remember you
[10:36] know the the things that are said so I
[10:41] write down where the Prophet explained
[10:43] it all right and jot down a little
[10:47] thought you
[10:49] know and and I've got it here where
[10:51] brother random is in the 288 of the seal
[10:55] book I didn't bring this quote but I
[10:57] might have brought it I can't remember
[11:00] but when he said talking about this my
[11:03] my words are spirit and their
[11:06] life he said the word is
[11:10] spirit
[11:12] in word form and that's the one I think
[11:15] we read this morning see I wrote that
[11:18] down where did I remember it it's in
[11:21] word
[11:23] form the form means uh like Jesus said
[11:28] uh not being T it equal but in the form
[11:31] of God the
[11:33] amorphia of God the changing from
[11:36] naturally what we see all right so
[11:40] the the word once it's
[11:45] revealed is changed in you
[11:49] amen right as always say about Martin
[11:52] Luther see don't tell them how many
[11:54] times he read
[11:56] that of the just shall live by faith
[11:59] but one day amen it was quickened unto
[12:03] him right he was ready to challenge the
[12:06] world you know about what he saw why
[12:10] because it was something
[12:11] alive he didn't care if they
[12:13] excommunicated him you know you know a
[12:17] good old Catholic boy they couldn't
[12:18] stand that cuz man they they believe you
[12:20] know you can excommunicated you you
[12:23] don't even make a trip to Paradise you
[12:25] you exit off some other way and you
[12:27] don't get no praying out the purgatories
[12:30] and things you know well it's a fear but
[12:34] Martin Luther didn't fear that cuz he
[12:37] had something alive in him all
[12:40] right now then that
[12:43] word Made
[12:47] Alive so then it would have to begin
[12:50] with having the germ you remember this
[12:54] morning in a grain of corn it's not the
[12:58] hust you know the outsides of the
[13:00] things it's not
[13:03] that it's that life within the grain is
[13:07] the seed of that corn all right see then
[13:12] The Word Alive in you and
[13:17] me is that seed of
[13:22] life something that we can stand on we
[13:26] don't have to be afraid of it right are
[13:29] you are you afraid that one day they're
[13:30] going to take you and deprogram
[13:33] you you know then then you don't have
[13:36] what you're talking about that's right
[13:40] right see the alive word can never be
[13:43] deprogrammed it get it just won't work
[13:46] you know but now let's read a few
[13:50] things in
[13:52] relation forgive me it started yesterday
[13:56] and it just aggravating this old
[14:00] gry cough drop don't have it sometimes
[14:03] but you know last night probably two
[14:06] hours of talking and then today
[14:11] but let's just read some things from the
[14:13] prophet let's start off with one we
[14:15] ended up with the last couple this
[14:17] morning and let's just read them and
[14:19] think about
[14:20] it and just comment very little go ahead
[14:23] when number
[14:25] seven on
[14:27] the notes which is God's power of
[14:31] transformation
[14:33] 1965 911 paragraph
[14:39] 33 he's talking about a familiar text
[14:42] and you pastors you know
[14:44] it but yet one thing about the word of
[14:48] God it never grows old that's right
[14:51] that's right now because it's
[14:55] God it never goes old through ever
[14:58] Generation Now from pretty near about
[15:02] 2,800 years or
[15:04] better this word of God has been read by
[15:07] man priest and so
[15:09] forth and never does it grow
[15:12] old I've been reading it myself for some
[15:15] 35 years and each time I read it I find
[15:19] something new that I looked over the
[15:23] first time are you familiar with that is
[15:25] that you know okay watching
[15:30] because it is
[15:33] inspired so you know that means you know
[15:38] what I think he's expressing is I read
[15:40] it and I get something new so you cannot
[15:45] exhaust the word of
[15:47] God why because it's
[15:49] inspired right all
[15:52] right it is God in letter
[15:57] form
[16:00] I like that next words there see it's
[16:03] the
[16:04] attributes of God speaking for
[16:07] forth and is placed on
[16:11] paper now the attributes of God are the
[16:13] thoughts of God right that's
[16:16] right all right so the Bible is the
[16:19] thoughts of
[16:22] God go ahead to number
[16:24] eight which is taken from the four
[16:27] seal
[16:29] we'll go down to paragraph
[16:30] 67 because he's dealing up here with the
[16:33] word and the spirit the word itself is
[16:35] spirit it's spirit and word
[16:37] form now that's that
[16:41] sounds uh in other words a man has to be
[16:44] speaking by Revelation about
[16:47] something if he's going to say that the
[16:50] word itself is
[16:53] spirit it's spirit and word form see
[16:56] there's something he's saying right
[16:58] because that's not human
[17:01] terminologies you you understand it's
[17:03] not just
[17:04] normal it's a person trying to express
[17:08] something he's trying to show us the the
[17:11] word and what it
[17:13] is all right then you see when it's
[17:15] quickened or brought to life the spirit
[17:18] of the word goes to work and it acts see
[17:20] because that now look here a thought has
[17:23] to be a
[17:25] thought before it can be a word that's
[17:28] right and then when a thought is
[17:30] presented it's a
[17:32] word now for the next few weeks we will
[17:35] be dealing with this
[17:38] thought the prophets got the
[17:43] thought he don't know they got the word
[17:45] now see
[17:48] you brother BR
[17:50] said it was first Moses
[17:53] thought he said it's not word
[17:57] yet
[17:58] he said then he speaks it it becomes the
[18:04] word right now so keep that in mind
[18:07] because that's what we're dealing with a
[18:09] thought has to be a thought before it
[18:10] can be a word then when a thought is
[18:12] presented it's a word now this you
[18:15] talking about the Bible
[18:17] right is the God's thought that he has
[18:21] placed in the
[18:25] word now watch and then when we re
[18:28] receive it from him it becomes a
[18:34] word
[18:36] so the entire
[18:39] Bible is the thoughts of
[18:41] God we are not having to are depending
[18:46] upon getting some thought out of some
[18:50] magical
[18:51] realm or somewhere because that's what
[18:54] man does that's what calls his
[18:57] organizations then
[19:00] denominations is people getting their
[19:04] thoughts all right the prophet said one
[19:08] Prophet will always
[19:12] compare with the other Prophet
[19:15] right all right see because he he's
[19:18] dependent on lining it
[19:21] up all right so then the thoughts of
[19:26] God has been brought to you and
[19:30] we're not trying to get so
[19:34] spiritual until we can hear the voice of
[19:37] God speak something to
[19:40] us because remember there's many
[19:43] voices and Satan can talk to you and it
[19:47] sounds real
[19:49] beautiful right and he talks to a lot of
[19:55] people but see I'm not trying to find
[19:57] something something
[19:59] else now I'm going to illustrate it so
[20:03] listen You'll see how much I depend on
[20:04] it I'm holding up to people that would
[20:07] never hear see what we're doing I'm
[20:09] holding up the
[20:11] Bible and I believe the prophet was
[20:13] saying this is God's
[20:16] thoughts right now and when we receive
[20:20] it's placed in the word and when we
[20:22] receive it it becomes a word all right
[20:27] now at the same time I'm going to hold
[20:30] up quotes of the Prophet which
[20:33] represents the
[20:35] message I believe this
[20:37] message brought to you and
[20:41] I what the Bible is
[20:46] saying right that's the purpose of a
[20:49] prophet all right now now he could not
[20:53] go he didn't go to gre's Alman and get
[20:56] something and bring it
[20:59] he took the
[21:01] Bible and from that Bible he expresses
[21:05] to you and
[21:06] I he calls it uh reading between the
[21:11] lines all right but remember now he
[21:17] said the between the lines can't be no
[21:20] different than what's on the line that's
[21:22] right right but see we could read that
[21:27] uh Abraham and
[21:31] Sarah he she was he was 100 she was 90
[21:35] you know all
[21:38] right and we realize hey no matter what
[21:41] age you're living in you know at that
[21:43] time it come on down to about 120 years
[21:46] but even if it's living a thousand years
[21:50] hundred's still
[21:52] gaining pretty good right right but now
[21:59] Abraham
[22:01] then had to
[22:04] believe that somebody was talking to him
[22:08] right and he was getting the
[22:11] thoughts all right now if he was getting
[22:14] the thoughts and he was getting
[22:17] old right but yet he takes off on a
[22:21] journey brother Brown said about I
[22:24] forgot how many miles seemed like he
[22:26] said 300 and he went down through there
[22:29] and they run into that King you know and
[22:32] the King wanted to take
[22:35] Grandma
[22:38] right
[22:39] sayah for his
[22:42] wife all right now we could read
[22:46] that right right but we could not get
[22:50] out of
[22:53] that that they were turned back right
[22:57] that's between between the lines but
[22:59] it's on the lines because it's already
[23:02] what's been said I'll return unto thee
[23:05] and I'll do this that and the other you
[23:07] know all right see the reading between
[23:10] the lines is not an addition so to me
[23:13] now you know people will take one and
[23:15] they line up with the other that's okay
[23:17] you know but to me this
[23:21] Bible this Prophet never added a word to
[23:25] it he told us what was in it
[23:28] right right we took this Bible and
[23:32] proved that hell was eternal according
[23:35] to our
[23:37] understanding he took this
[23:39] Bible and proved that hell was not
[23:44] Eternal and he had it all lined up right
[23:48] all right so you see my
[23:52] dependence we don't know what this Bible
[23:56] says unless we know what what this
[23:58] Prophet has brought us that's right well
[24:00] that's my total dependence now it's
[24:02] always been that way and that's the way
[24:04] I believe it I don't believe he can tell
[24:06] you anything contrary he cannot add to
[24:09] the
[24:11] word and that's where a lot of people
[24:13] think you know that they say well well
[24:16] uh brother Brandon about the the seven
[24:18] Thunders he said that'll be made known
[24:21] to somebody in other words to you he
[24:24] said
[24:24] no you can't add to the word word or
[24:29] take away he said it's what's in the
[24:32] word all right see that way then what
[24:36] are we looking at we're looking at that
[24:39] this
[24:40] prophet in expressing the
[24:44] word to
[24:46] us he's bringing the thoughts of God
[24:50] Amen right to you and I
[24:54] right now if that thought's contrary to
[24:56] the Bible where would we have
[25:00] it but see he's telling us what the
[25:03] Bible is saying and that's making a
[25:07] thought so he said this is God's thought
[25:11] when we receive
[25:13] it it becomes a
[25:15] word so it's not the
[25:18] word so you say the the seed is the word
[25:22] now what are you
[25:26] saying are you saying the letter of the
[25:31] Bible see where we'd be going wrong it's
[25:35] not the letter of the
[25:38] Bible this Bible is not now I'm on pray
[25:43] God help
[25:46] me this is
[25:50] not what can I
[25:53] say would you understand it if I said
[25:56] this is not the word of God without
[25:57] going haywire on
[25:59] me this is the word of God but every
[26:04] word in this Bible the prophet said has
[26:08] been made Alive by
[26:11] somebody
[26:13] right this Bible is a record of a living
[26:16] people now do you understand what I
[26:20] mean it's a record of people Peter James
[26:26] John it it's been made
[26:30] alive but there's some things in here
[26:32] that ain't been made
[26:35] alive right that's right right now there
[26:40] where that's right this comes
[26:44] in to tell us what ain't been made alive
[26:47] yet but yet it's been spoke
[26:50] of Chang in a moment twinkle of an eye
[26:53] that hasn't been made alive that's right
[26:56] but it's been spoke of
[27:00] ire like we read it see Lord himself
[27:03] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[27:05] oh one of these days we look at you're
[27:07] com to God down
[27:12] hey we found out that ain't exactly what
[27:14] it is well that's between the lines no
[27:19] that's off the lines because it's not
[27:21] anything the line
[27:23] says you just got to find out who the
[27:26] Lord is and how he descends right and he
[27:30] descends through what the prophet's
[27:33] message all right now you got it in the
[27:37] right place see now you can say the
[27:41] Bible is a seed now you can say the
[27:43] Bible the word of God is a seed why
[27:46] because it's something like Mary that we
[27:49] said this
[27:51] morning even though she could
[27:54] say within
[27:56] herself
[27:58] and believe that Isaiah
[28:00] 9:6 do you understand what what I
[28:03] believe the prophet was expressing one
[28:05] of these days if you don't run it in
[28:07] your computer you can find it that he
[28:09] was
[28:10] explaining that Mary heard from her
[28:14] mother what a virgin shall
[28:19] conceive now when that was made alive to
[28:24] her when that
[28:26] angel there's no record that he quote in
[28:28] Isaiah
[28:30] 9:6 you know what I
[28:32] mean he's not emphasizing the scripture
[28:36] as
[28:36] much as he's emphasizing the personal
[28:39] appearance to
[28:41] her all
[28:42] right and she says be it unto me
[28:46] according to Thy
[28:48] word without the Holy
[28:51] Ghost
[28:54] right without the Holy Ghost to to
[28:57] explain
[28:58] it but brother R said she was simply
[29:02] looking back and
[29:03] saying that's Isaiah
[29:06] 96 now remember another time in the
[29:10] Bible when a man was sitting there and
[29:13] he took the scroll and he read
[29:16] it you remember he said this day this
[29:22] scripture is what revealed or made alive
[29:27] right
[29:27] right remember
[29:29] Jesus Isaiah 61 you know this day there
[29:32] script wasn't that what Mary was
[29:34] saying this day Isaiah
[29:37] 9:6 is
[29:40] alive in me
[29:45] right be it unto me according to Thy
[29:48] word Isaiah 9:6 is
[29:51] alive she wasn't just taking something
[29:55] out of the Skies from an angel
[29:58] you know a thought or an idea she had
[30:02] the
[30:06] scriptures she was in the scriptures her
[30:09] mother had told
[30:10] her you remember Moses mom told
[30:15] him right you know he took mom's
[30:19] Revelation and he tried to deliver
[30:21] Israel right and he got a dead
[30:26] Egyptian but when he went to the back
[30:28] side of the
[30:30] desert there was no
[30:33] scripture that he could
[30:35] read about
[30:38] that right go remember he was the one
[30:40] that wrote it later on okay you you get
[30:44] me he now know
[30:46] scripture but that one spoke from the
[30:48] burning
[30:49] bush made it so real until he takes off
[30:53] to
[30:54] Egypt to
[30:56] deliver see when you and I
[31:00] realize as the prophet said who we are
[31:04] and what we're doing
[31:07] here we're going to say this day this
[31:11] scripture is
[31:13] fulfilled right because it'll be real to
[31:16] you and I now there's the seed of
[31:19] God it's something real a seed remember
[31:25] takes the two the union of time
[31:27] it's
[31:29] alive every word of God is a
[31:31] seed
[31:33] right but remember it's an a alive word
[31:39] okay think about it look at the next one
[31:43] the queen of the South 1960 11:27 the
[31:47] evening
[31:51] E34 he's talking about Holy Ghost is an
[31:54] assurance to you that you'll get it you
[31:56] receive it that way
[31:58] way and see just like those praying for
[32:01] the Holy Ghost this
[32:04] morning see to
[32:07] me somewhere God will meet
[32:10] you right and you'll say this day this
[32:15] scripture is
[32:17] fulfilled because it's a reality to you
[32:20] all
[32:20] right it depends on your attitude
[32:23] towards the
[32:24] word the word is the not the
[32:27] paper it's just a
[32:30] book but it's Christ made manifest on
[32:36] paper all right that's what it is God in
[32:40] the beginning was the word the word was
[32:41] with God and the Word was God and the
[32:43] Word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[32:45] see and his words are spirit and
[32:50] life look we just receive his word just
[32:55] like it was
[32:57] he
[33:00] himself now that's not letters on a
[33:04] page
[33:10] right people have argued that mankind
[33:12] wrote the word Prophet said I beg your
[33:15] pardon he said God wrote the
[33:18] word through the
[33:20] prophets all right but think about it we
[33:23] just receive his word just like it was
[33:27] he
[33:29] himself when I see his promise to me
[33:32] that's Christ I embrace it he can't lie
[33:37] to to me that's exactly the truth see I
[33:41] might not know how to take a hold of it
[33:46] but it's the truth and I hold that right
[33:49] I hold right with it because it's Christ
[33:52] to me
[33:55] now if you need
[33:59] healing ask God to reveal to you you're
[34:02] healed that's
[34:05] right and then when he revealed to you
[34:07] you life at the
[34:10] doctor but before he revealed it to you
[34:14] you're going to listen to what the
[34:15] doctor said
[34:18] right but see when it comes off the
[34:21] page into your
[34:25] heart now you got something that's right
[34:28] amen you don't have to worry about it
[34:31] that's true doctor tells you like he
[34:33] told me you going to take your kneecap
[34:34] off I said you don't never take my
[34:36] kneecap off he just laughed and
[34:40] said go on I'll take it
[34:43] off come that day it was you know with
[34:47] these operations they can do now you
[34:48] know and leave everything there back
[34:50] then it was just take it off and you you
[34:52] walk like Chester you you know he was
[34:54] STI fled because you didn't have no ni
[34:57] out
[34:59] but you say well who said that when he
[35:03] said it to you well
[35:05] evidently somebody besides me said
[35:09] it because I still have my legs you know
[35:11] my knaps all right now but listen to
[35:15] what he's
[35:17] saying all right going to the next one
[35:21] we just received his word just like it
[35:23] was he
[35:25] himself and you're going to get
[35:27] something when you get it that way amen
[35:29] all right look what he says here on
[35:31] Christ's mystery of God
[35:35] reveal paragraph
[35:38] 529 then our headship is a
[35:41] kingdom the kingdom of God is within you
[35:44] that's the new birth right Jesus
[35:46] speaking of the Kingdom in you said the
[35:49] Bible Jesus the kingdom we're not a
[35:53] denomination we belong to a kingdom one
[35:57] watch and the kingdom is the word of God
[36:01] made spirit and life in our own
[36:04] life bringing to pass every promise in
[36:07] this day as it did in that day when the
[36:12] word and God was
[36:16] one now we don't I'm plain we don't
[36:21] believe this next
[36:24] wording and the word and God is one in
[36:27] his church today oh making it the
[36:30] headship well one of these days it'll be
[36:36] there you remember this morning on
[36:38] spoken words Original Seed where brother
[36:40] BR was said to be born by the word and
[36:43] spirit brings you back like you should
[36:45] have been in the
[36:49] beginning then if you have the new
[36:53] birth your soul is back like it should
[36:55] have been in the beginning that's right
[36:58] amen well I just don't know maybe
[37:01] brother Dale in a way brother R said
[37:03] it's not in a way right is either right
[37:06] it ain't right that's right look the
[37:09] word and God is one in his church
[37:12] today well one of these days brother
[37:14] de's going to
[37:17] come well he
[37:20] lied CU he said it's there today that's
[37:23] right well he was just deceiving you
[37:26] well he done a good job because I just
[37:27] kind of believe what he
[37:29] said look at making it the headship of
[37:32] the
[37:33] body that is
[37:36] redeemed to bring the
[37:39] message in the last
[37:42] day and I thought brother Rand brought
[37:44] the
[37:50] message he's speaking
[37:52] of the
[37:55] church
[37:59] what are you looking now get off the
[38:01] garbage I explained it to start
[38:04] with you don't add to the word of God
[38:07] the prophet didn't add to the word of
[38:09] God it's got to be in the word of God so
[38:12] if he's saying that it's got to be in
[38:14] the word of God that's
[38:17] right Paul talks of the headship
[38:21] right to the people back
[38:24] there and it was their
[38:27] head we brother around spoke of a
[38:29] headship to come in the Statue of a
[38:31] perfect
[38:33] man called
[38:35] love all right now he's talking
[38:38] about that the head and the body is
[38:41] going to get together and bring the
[38:44] message we'll get down in a minute to
[38:46] the
[38:47] point and be taken up from the dead in
[38:51] the resurrection to go back and restore
[38:53] again as Adam and Eve in the beginning
[38:56] in the Garden of Eden the three-fold
[38:59] mystery of God in his body he said oh
[39:04] my so then it's got to be in
[39:09] you now how does the word get in you
[39:11] roll to the next one I'm trying to hurry
[39:13] so
[39:14] okay Satan's Eden 65829 paragraph
[39:18] 89 every seed will bring forth of its
[39:22] kind if you are a seed of God an
[39:25] attribute
[39:28] a Son of
[39:30] God then the word of God is sown in
[39:38] you come
[39:41] on see and then when you hear the word
[39:44] of God my sheep hear my voice a stranger
[39:47] they won't follow you get it then every
[39:51] seed comes forth after its own
[39:54] kind the word has to be sown yes what
[39:59] did the prophet say I'm going sowing
[40:02] seed is that the way he said
[40:06] it you remember he was going
[40:09] overseas right and the Holy Spirit said
[40:13] don't go that's right or the people over
[40:16] there was really the ones that done it
[40:18] he said go back home and store up food
[40:22] he said I don't know what I'm doing but
[40:25] I'm so in
[40:28] and look at all the messages he stored
[40:32] up that he wouldn't stored up that he
[40:34] went
[40:35] overseas all
[40:37] right but look at it as for you and I
[40:40] look at the next one which is Christ
[40:42] revealed in his own word 65822 the
[40:45] morning service paragraph 91 and 92 and
[40:48] while to the while to the True Believer
[40:51] it's the revelation of God being
[40:54] revealed in the age
[40:57] we're living
[40:59] in
[41:03] now look what your Prophet
[41:06] says you
[41:09] remember only he could say my words are
[41:12] Spirit in
[41:13] life but when it's revealed to
[41:20] you come
[41:22] on when it's made known to you it's the
[41:25] same Rev ation that's right
[41:29] right when the word made known to you
[41:31] it's eternal
[41:32] life so look what he's saying it's
[41:35] revelation of God being revealed in the
[41:37] age you're living in he said my words
[41:39] are spirit and
[41:42] life Jesus said that again the word is
[41:45] the seed that a s sowed we know that
[41:47] that's true it's God in word form and
[41:51] can only be interpreted by himself so so
[41:56] brother around them can't interpret the
[41:59] word now don't get me all messed up I
[42:02] can quote with you too I know that Moses
[42:05] wrote the
[42:07] word but you better remember God
[42:11] interpreted amen
[42:15] right the human mind is not capable to
[42:18] interpret the mind of God how can the
[42:21] little finite mind interpret the
[42:23] infinite mind when we can't even
[42:26] interpret one another's
[42:28] mind right and you notice he is the only
[42:31] one can interpret it and he interprets
[42:34] it to whom he
[42:37] will it didn't say Mortals of old as
[42:40] they stred across the Earth in sura
[42:43] times and diverse
[42:44] manners God in Su times and diverse
[42:47] manners revealed himself to His
[42:51] prophets so then it's coming
[42:55] forth it's being
[42:57] revealed made known to you and
[43:02] I okay save time he says show us the
[43:07] father he said every word is a
[43:10] seed when to get to a point where we can
[43:12] get out of
[43:14] here all
[43:16] right but you know a seed has to be
[43:22] sown a seed has to be sown right
[43:26] I mean they had it in the Garners of
[43:28] Egypt laying there for thousands of
[43:32] years they took it out and put the
[43:34] moisture to it it produced right why
[43:38] because it was wheat
[43:40] seed it's necessary that the seed be
[43:43] sown right all right it's necessary to
[43:46] have a swer then right now the son of
[43:50] man SED the seed right and the son of
[43:54] man is the only s of the seed
[43:56] on
[43:57] go cuz that way you'll tie together
[44:00] every Prophet where they would be listed
[44:02] like Jeremiah son of
[44:04] man we know Jeremiah was not the son of
[44:07] man he was a son of man brother randam
[44:10] was not the son of man he was a son of
[44:13] man the Lord Jesus Christ Drew each one
[44:16] of those
[44:18] prophets
[44:20] right SED the seed for that
[44:23] age so he's going to have to keep on
[44:25] sowing it
[44:27] but he's got to have a
[44:29] vessel to sew that
[44:32] seed if he doesn't have a
[44:35] vessel then there's no
[44:39] sewing all right so now I didn't write
[44:42] these
[44:44] scriptures and it doesn't make one bit
[44:46] of word out of anything out of me any
[44:48] different it just makes the word
[44:51] right look at what brother R said I mean
[44:53] look what the scripture says Romans 10
[44:56] go ahead number 14
[44:59] right Romans
[45:01] 10:13 through
[45:04] 17 for whosoever shall call upon the
[45:07] name of the Lord shall be
[45:09] saved
[45:11] okay how can they call on him in whom
[45:14] they have not
[45:19] believed well I was just out and it just
[45:21] fell out of the
[45:23] sky no you heard something
[45:27] somebody as I said Mary heard from her
[45:38] mother Faith comth by
[45:41] hearing and hearing by the
[45:43] word
[45:45] right how then shall they call on him in
[45:48] whom they have not believed and how
[45:50] shall they believe in him whom they have
[45:51] not
[45:53] heard and how shall they hear without
[45:55] without a
[45:58] preacher well bless God I got it myself
[46:01] I didn't get no preacher you heard the
[46:04] prophet's message he was the preacher
[46:06] you read the Bible he that was the
[46:08] preacher come on quit being
[46:11] silly oh boy I corrected him but I ain't
[46:15] heard it from
[46:16] nobody I've heard a lot of people say
[46:19] that that what I got nobody didn't give
[46:22] me I believed
[46:24] them
[46:28] I definitely believe that God didn't
[46:29] give it to
[46:31] him
[46:35] right you remember the the old man that
[46:38] was making fun of brother randman said
[46:40] there was some old hillbilly up in the
[46:41] mountain or something up in there give
[46:42] him that revelation of the of the
[46:44] serpent
[46:45] seed you know he said that's blaspheming
[46:48] the Holy
[46:50] Ghost but it wasn't that it was God
[46:52] bringing it right but
[46:54] look
[46:59] and how shall they hear without a
[47:03] preacher all right now
[47:06] watch and how shall they preach except
[47:09] they be
[47:12] sent now if they're not
[47:16] sent they are not Angel Messengers from
[47:19] God now remember Satan
[47:23] has
[47:24] ministers and he says they're even as
[47:27] Ministers of
[47:30] righteousness
[47:31] right he has his
[47:36] preachers that don't make nothing out of
[47:38] me because I say to be a preacher
[47:40] because that kills me if I don't follow
[47:43] what God
[47:46] says one of these days I'll get down to
[47:49] preaching I see cuz it's laying on my
[47:52] desk my wife gets on to me all the time
[47:54] but she won't move them they all staple
[47:56] together and waiting for sermon after
[47:58] sermon after
[48:00] sermon I've told you
[48:02] before the nine spiritual
[48:05] gifts are subject to people in the
[48:08] congregation brother BR said you can
[48:10] speak in tongues you prophesy he said
[48:13] don't make you a prophet he said God God
[48:15] use you one time never use you again
[48:18] Saul was listed with the prophets you
[48:20] know why cuz he got down and got on the
[48:22] spout and
[48:23] prophesied come on he what one of the
[48:26] prophets said the word come
[48:30] to but he said the fivefold
[48:34] ministry
[48:37] right is different from the nine
[48:39] spiritual
[48:42] gifts I believe
[48:44] everything you believe everything the
[48:46] prophet said let's sit down and talk a
[48:49] little
[48:53] while the five-fold ministry is
[48:58] predestinated as
[49:01] gifts from God to the
[49:06] congregation hey I'm number one to
[49:08] admit I wouldn't sit under some of
[49:12] them because I don't think they're they
[49:15] might be a preacher but they're not
[49:20] sent right amen I'm
[49:24] honest
[49:27] but you
[49:28] see as it is
[49:33] written look at the text that's my point
[49:35] of using all of this so let's read it
[49:38] and how shall they preach except to be
[49:40] sin that is written our beautiful I feet
[49:42] my old toenails is messed up so that's
[49:44] not
[49:45] pretty that preach the gospel of
[49:50] peace all right and bring Glad Tidings
[49:53] of good things right but they have not
[49:57] obeyed the
[50:00] gospel a lot of preachers don't preach
[50:02] the gospel why the prophet said preach
[50:05] don't
[50:07] teach people teach the word of God not
[50:10] preach
[50:11] it preaching is power and
[50:14] demonstration it's not signs and
[50:17] wonders it's a personal experience in
[50:20] your own life it's you telling how the
[50:24] candle got lit okay but they have not
[50:27] obeyed the gospel Isaiah
[50:30] said Lord who ha believed our report so
[50:33] then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[50:36] by the word of God
[50:39] uh how can they hear without a preacher
[50:42] how can he preach Les he be sinned faith
[50:44] comes by hearing that's all in one
[50:46] text right right right so you got to
[50:51] have
[50:53] somebody right
[50:58] somebody that gets a revelation and
[51:00] speaks it all right we're doing good so
[51:02] we get to the next
[51:05] one this is God's provided way of
[51:07] approach to Fellowship 1960 709 uh
[51:12] E40 he's talking about scarlet and hiss
[51:16] Etc and water speaks of the spirit as
[51:18] speaks of the word and when the word and
[51:21] spirit get together something takes
[51:22] place now watch it when the true spirit
[51:26] of God can come
[51:29] in on the
[51:31] word that's being
[51:35] preached Faith cometh by
[51:39] hearing are you reading it when the true
[51:43] spirit of God can come can come in on
[51:46] the word that's being preached Faith
[51:48] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[51:53] word so if they're not sent they're not
[51:55] going to preach the
[51:58] truth and the Holy Spirit came for quick
[52:01] an error that's right well the Lord told
[52:04] me there's three Gods now you heard
[52:07] voices from somewhere
[52:09] else right there's no such
[52:12] thing I don't care how many angels you
[52:16] saw and how many things signs and
[52:19] wonders the Bible said if they give you
[52:21] a sign and it comes to
[52:23] pass but they tell you to another God
[52:27] don't hear
[52:31] them
[52:33] what when the true spirit of God can
[52:35] come in on the word that's being
[52:39] preached now I've told you this I keep
[52:41] telling you don't bother to me you can
[52:43] think what you want to the Lord spoke to
[52:46] me one day and he said you preach the
[52:48] truth and I'll back it
[52:51] up honestly as a human being I thought
[52:54] Lord I'm doing my best to preach the
[52:59] truth it took me quite a while to
[53:01] realize what he was
[53:04] saying just keep on preaching it just
[53:08] keep on preaching the
[53:10] truth and he said I'll bring it to
[53:15] pass now I had rather do what I've done
[53:18] this
[53:21] morning to the brother and sister that
[53:24] wanted to baptis with the Holy
[53:26] Ghost to just remind them of the word
[53:32] right and tell them what the word
[53:34] says tell them the way the prophet said
[53:37] those
[53:38] things and then let God speak to
[53:42] himen to Brother Gary he's listening
[53:45] this afternoon I hope CU he was still
[53:48] sick he knows that he would tell me I
[53:51] believe this I believe that I said
[53:54] that's fine Brother
[53:56] but that ain't the new
[53:58] birth you'll find out one day what it is
[54:03] and you'll call
[54:05] me but see Faith cometh by
[54:11] hearing Peter and him didn't give a
[54:13] great alar call scream and holler cry
[54:16] and pray two weeks and then get up and
[54:19] say no while Peter was preaching the
[54:24] word
[54:26] am I right the Holy Ghost fell on the
[54:30] people I'd rather have that than
[54:32] anything you can come up with I believe
[54:35] in shouting I believe in screaming
[54:37] crying praying I believe in every bit of
[54:41] it but I don't have to have that to
[54:44] believe God's
[54:46] word
[54:47] right I can believe the word and it'll
[54:50] take care of the rest of
[54:54] it
[54:55] you get the spirit now here let me read
[54:58] this
[54:59] one uh faith comes by hearing he by the
[55:02] word and the true
[55:04] Spirit me back down back
[55:08] okay it'll manifest itself every promise
[55:12] that God made it'll bring it to pass and
[55:16] make it so the right mental
[55:20] attitude towards any Divine promise of
[55:25] God will bring it to
[55:27] viice if you could get the spirit with
[55:30] the word
[55:33] right right mental well I've got the
[55:35] right mental attitude let's God I'm sick
[55:38] I want to be
[55:40] healed ain't that the right mental
[55:48] attitude if you could get the spirit
[55:51] with the word amen amen then you real
[55:55] you're already
[55:57] healed all
[55:59] right look at the next
[56:02] one remember these are the things your
[56:05] Prophet is say things that are to be
[56:08] 1965
[56:10] 1205 paragraph
[56:13] 14 but I'm very thankful for these open
[56:16] doors that I had to go
[56:18] into he was preaching this in uh Rialto
[56:23] California
[56:26] that I had to go into and the
[56:28] inspiration it gives to young men like
[56:30] your pastor here that's caused them and
[56:34] I'm beginning to get old and know that
[56:37] my days are
[56:38] numbered and watch you and know now that
[56:42] these young men can take this message
[56:46] and sweep it on to the coming of the
[56:50] Lord CU if he don't come in my
[56:52] generation he done looking for it
[56:55] these young men are going to take this
[56:57] message and sweep it
[57:01] on
[57:04] right somebody's going to take this
[57:06] message and keep expressing it one more
[57:10] a long reading but it's off the message
[57:13] believe in God
[57:15] 1952 224 preach in
[57:20] Jeffersonville I want you to watch what
[57:22] a preacher
[57:23] does I tried my best to explain this to
[57:27] you cuz this is all I can
[57:30] do I can't give you the Holy Ghost I
[57:34] can't do anything for you other than one
[57:36] thing and that's preach the gospel amen
[57:40] watch you the only thing that kept me
[57:43] from being saved when I was 12 years
[57:47] old it's your Prophet Godly Spirit hung
[57:50] over me a
[57:52] devil well now brother brother brandom
[57:56] uh you
[57:58] said that you would have saved at
[58:02] 12 well you always was eternal all you
[58:05] had to do is believe
[58:09] it come on I know that don't go
[58:15] good when I was 12 because the spirit
[58:18] hung over me a devil saying wait a
[58:21] little while
[58:22] longer that's your reason you wasn't
[58:25] saved when you become the age of
[58:29] accountability nobody knows what the age
[58:31] of accountability is because it's
[58:32] according to your understanding right
[58:35] all
[58:36] right a spirit when you got with a crowd
[58:41] and that hovered over you it kept
[58:43] hanging over you you wanted to do
[58:47] right there's not a man that's got his
[58:50] right mind but what wants to do
[58:53] right
[58:55] but there's something won't let you do
[58:57] right is that right that's the devil and
[59:02] way right in the middle of telling you
[59:03] how bad it is he always
[59:07] Hallelujah Christ pids your healing in
[59:10] your
[59:11] salvation
[59:13] watching now here it
[59:15] is you get
[59:18] it that's not me that's him now here it
[59:22] is you get it he could commission his
[59:26] church cast out them
[59:28] Devils commission his church to cast
[59:30] them Devils

[59:35] cast out
[59:37] Devils you ain't going to heal

[1:03:00] okay look is what he gave every gospel
[1:03:04] preacher who will believe him what did
[1:03:07] he give him the power and
[1:03:10] authority to break that
[1:03:15] Spirit okay I believe with all of my
[1:03:18] heart every demon power that's in here
[1:03:21] this minute is already broken
[1:03:25] I do I believe that every sick person in
[1:03:28] here right now feels a lot different if
[1:03:31] that's right raise up your hand you who
[1:03:33] is sick see
[1:03:35] there you what's the matter that devil
[1:03:39] has broke away from you he has to Faith
[1:03:43] cometh by hearing and the hearing of the
[1:03:45] word Jesus Christ died for
[1:03:51] you what keeps us from being saved a
[1:03:53] devil y hanging over us what keeps us
[1:03:57] from being healed a
[1:03:59] devil but we don't want to admit that we
[1:04:02] got them
[1:04:03] Devils
[1:04:05] right and until we realize it's a
[1:04:09] devil Brother D I don't like you talk
[1:04:11] like that to
[1:04:12] me you telling me there's a devil they
[1:04:16] got a
[1:04:17] devil well the Lord Jesus said get
[1:04:21] behind me Satan was speaking to Peter
[1:04:25] that's right was it Peter or was it the
[1:04:28] devil in
[1:04:29] Peter the anointing guy on Peter which
[1:04:32] one was it right all
[1:04:35] right you see where we ought to say
[1:04:41] okay I'm confessing my
[1:04:46] sins I want you to pray for me to be
[1:04:52] healed I haven't sinned I'll have you to
[1:04:55] know you remember the lady that brother
[1:04:58] that Jack Cole said and she come up
[1:05:01] there and said I want to lay my tongue
[1:05:03] on the
[1:05:05] altar she said I've got a bad problem
[1:05:08] with a
[1:05:09] tongue he said ma'am it ain't possible
[1:05:13] said because his pull Pit's only 14
[1:05:16] ft and said ain't enough room to lay
[1:05:18] your
[1:05:20] tongue now did she go home healed I
[1:05:23] doubt it amen don't
[1:05:26] you if you come up here to me this
[1:05:28] evening brother D we prayed for okay
[1:05:30] let's pray the devil off
[1:05:36] first now sister Kathy how would you
[1:05:39] like it if I said that to
[1:05:46] you I said the healing is no problem
[1:05:49] it's getting rid of the
[1:05:53] devil
[1:05:54] H how can they hear without a
[1:05:57] preacher and how can he preach unless he
[1:06:00] be
[1:06:02] sinned so then faith comes by hearing
[1:06:05] and hearing by the
[1:06:08] word you said well the Bible already
[1:06:10] sold the prophet said these ministers
[1:06:14] will take this and sweep it on to the
[1:06:16] coming of the
[1:06:17] Lord he said and they'll break that
[1:06:22] spell I stand right here and preach I do
[1:06:25] not have discernment now there's a
[1:06:27] certain discernment goes with every
[1:06:29] preacher there's a certain discernment
[1:06:30] goes with every Born Again believer come
[1:06:32] on I mean there certain discernment goes
[1:06:35] with ever born again believer am I
[1:06:36] putting in the right place there's a
[1:06:37] certain discernment goes with preacher I
[1:06:39] stand right here sometimes and preach
[1:06:41] and I see that demon leave
[1:06:50] you but then I can say a word or two and
[1:06:53] I see it come back
[1:07:00] you know we used to live in a world that
[1:07:02] the pastor
[1:07:07] was I mean he' just take the kids out
[1:07:09] and give them a
[1:07:10] whooping
[1:07:12] right come on that
[1:07:16] right you know nobody didn't say a
[1:07:19] word bless God that need
[1:07:22] it you know
[1:07:25] I wouldn't do it today for
[1:07:27] nothing be in jail the next
[1:07:30] day now brother D I wouldn't put you in
[1:07:36] jail do you mind if I say I don't trust
[1:07:47] you that's not being funny that's
[1:07:48] telling the
[1:07:51] truth but you see all I can do is preach
[1:07:54] the
[1:07:55] gospel and when you see what I'm talking
[1:07:58] about you just lighten
[1:08:01] up you
[1:08:03] know now what have I told you a
[1:08:09] secret lot of you have been around here
[1:08:10] a long time I told you a secret a long
[1:08:12] time ago that goes with my Ministry cuz
[1:08:16] it goes with ever preacher's
[1:08:20] Ministry see I can break that spell that
[1:08:22] Satan has over your eyes
[1:08:26] but when God reveals something to you
[1:08:28] you're listening to a tape you're riding
[1:08:29] down a highway you are whatever in the
[1:08:32] middle of the night you wake up and God
[1:08:34] is speaking to you and things start
[1:08:36] being revealed to you raise your hands
[1:08:39] and say my family my
[1:08:45] children why cuz you're in a realm that
[1:08:48] you don't get in very
[1:08:50] often you admit that it's sweet as
[1:08:53] wonderful right while he's there with
[1:08:55] you
[1:08:56] right what I see here sometime I think
[1:09:00] raise your
[1:09:01] hands accept
[1:09:04] it you said Brother D I've seen that you
[1:09:07] just missed an
[1:09:09] opportunity maybe I shouldn't have told
[1:09:11] that because that is a
[1:09:14] secret that's
[1:09:16] right I can put it in other
[1:09:20] Realms because if you really a minister
[1:09:23] I can take my gift and sell fried ice
[1:09:28] cream to an
[1:09:33] Eskimo how many of you ever dealt with
[1:09:35] me about buying or something I make one
[1:09:39] price and I never tell you another
[1:09:43] one because I know what I can do with
[1:09:46] that gift I can get it out of
[1:09:50] you but that's using the gift wrong
[1:09:54] a man told me one day he said if I was
[1:09:57] interested talking about somebody else
[1:09:59] he said if I was interested in trying to
[1:10:00] get that girl to be my wife he said
[1:10:03] every time she turned around I'd be
[1:10:04] standing in front of her I thought oh
[1:10:07] God you just sold your
[1:10:13] gift you just sold your
[1:10:16] gift I'm not selling my gift I'm trying
[1:10:19] to help you with a gift
[1:10:22] amen if you see something say thank you
[1:10:27] Lord I see
[1:10:31] it then you'll be
[1:10:34] shouting right is that right sister Gail
[1:10:37] vacuuming or whatever she was doing in
[1:10:38] the
[1:10:39] kitchen living room just all at once
[1:10:43] something says there's just one
[1:10:51] God faith cometh by
[1:10:54] hearing you see why I preach so
[1:10:58] hard I want you to believe the
[1:11:01] word then God can take that word and
[1:11:03] Quicken it let's
[1:11:04] stand we won't even have any singing go
[1:11:07] to 20 after 3 we get done early you can
[1:11:10] go home and make sure and stay safe but
[1:11:13] we'll never go away without having a
[1:11:15] alter call if you want to
[1:11:17] come and then others can go home and
[1:11:20] we'll stay here with you so if you want
[1:11:22] to be prayed for come come and let do
[1:11:26] it
[1:11:27] I love
[1:11:30] him
[1:11:50] I weed yesterday about healing orever
[1:11:54] with a minute with him for a
[1:11:55] minute he said I see now what it is all
[1:11:59] right let's pray for that demon of
[1:12:01] unbelief to be took away yes sir that
[1:12:04] God can come and speak straight to you
[1:12:07] right that you're healed that's right
[1:12:09] cuz that's all I can
[1:12:11] do pray for the spirit to leave I can't
[1:12:14] heal
[1:12:16] you you think I wouldn't give this man
[1:12:18] here his eyesight if I had the
[1:12:22] ability but no
[1:12:24] but I
[1:12:25] can try to cast that demon of unbelief
[1:12:28] off and that's not making was God was
[1:12:32] Jesus making Peter a devil no no it was
[1:12:36] the
[1:12:38] devil hindering
[1:12:41] Peter
[1:12:42] father all we got is a gift it was GI to
[1:12:47] us thank you we didn't ask you for it we
[1:12:51] fought it like crazy trying to get away
[1:12:53] from it
[1:12:55] but yet we see what that gift really is
[1:12:58] thank you Lord It's Christ to the people
[1:13:00] if they can just believe it it's what
[1:13:03] he's given them thank you CU he said he
[1:13:05] gave some Apostles some prophets he gave
[1:13:08] us what we have need of Lord Jesus we
[1:13:11] just lay our hands on our brother to
[1:13:13] cast this demon of unbelief thank you
[1:13:15] Lord to break the spell that he has over
[1:13:17] our brother to keep him from just
[1:13:20] walking straight in and saying by his
[1:13:21] stripes I'm Healed he said it millions
[1:13:24] of times Lord but one more
[1:13:28] time in Jesus name amen we count it
[1:13:32] so go Hallelujah and
[1:13:35] see because it'll be made
[1:13:42] Manifest this problem with his leg so
[1:13:45] let's just believe
[1:13:47] it must believe that God is the
[1:13:51] Healer and if there's any problem of
[1:13:53] unbelief of anything we just try our
[1:13:56] best to cast that
[1:13:58] off to get us clear enough to where we
[1:14:00] can believe God lord
[1:14:03] Jesus our brother's got a problem with
[1:14:06] his
[1:14:07] leg we wish we could
[1:14:10] healing but father we can't but we can
[1:14:14] pray that that demon that would be in
[1:14:16] any hindrance around him would be taken
[1:14:20] away because that is the commission that
