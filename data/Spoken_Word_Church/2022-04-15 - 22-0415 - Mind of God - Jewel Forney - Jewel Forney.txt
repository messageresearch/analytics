day lord in the name of jesus christ we pray lord amen god bless you may be seated praise the lord thank the lord for the reading of the word of god tonight pray the lord pray lord so we thank the lord for the word of god hallelujah but we begin to look at this scripture right here in the beginning how that everything started right here started from the book of genesis hallelujah i don't care how you get it if you're going to get anything from god you've got to go back to genesis how if you could if you can get a revelation what happened in genesis how do you do you could see the whole thing the whole revelation opened up i know i don't care where you come or where you start you start from genesis and it'll bring you'll always see it all the way through the bible hello by the grace of god but god how do we realize here and why why did god want to use genesis in him in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth holy was nothing up it was nothing now one time it was just darkness there was nothing moving here with no life there but holly but god spoke how he spoke the word of god let there be light and light came here in hell i want to tell you people about them almighty god that's the only way we could ever get saved that's the only way we can get delivered from anything you got to hear the word of god this word this i'm telling people this word is supernatural honey if you try to if you call yourself i believe god and you don't believe the supernatural it ain't gonna work for you how you gonna read it you could talk and you could say i can believe it holy but when it come when that revelation come flush that when it come real how did people realize here today we realized that god wanted us to come to that revelation of the word coming real real flesh with it how does god want flesh on him but we want to take for a title there the tree of life that was predestinated to die on the tree i said he was predestinated to die hey you said brother you say why you say bro why are you saying god he had a purpose in his mind he didn't he has a secret in his mind how he didn't tell it to nobody but he started with the he started with the tree and he said well if the tree and the guardian the good and evil i did so that was a fight started from there hey that fight started in heaven hallelujah started in that he kicked him out how did that that was a war star today but it started on earth here and he had two god he had two trees there the good and evil and that's where the stars start right there and that way but he had something in his mind that he was going to make known to the bride or make towards his brother to his bride here it was something that i'm going to get rid of this devil i'm going to get rid of all the power of the devil how the people we fight you say brother this is the edge right here you better know that you've got the holy ghost hey you better know where you stand in the revelation here because this devil is not playing today how this world is falling apart demonic spirits are rolling all over the place how little people are by the power of god these spirits trying to get rid of the bride they try to get rid of everybody satan don't care nothing about being he he don't care nothing about me he want to get rid of everybody he rushed he could kill every man on this earth he wished he could send every man to hell but i'm going to tell you what he said a group of people cannot touch there's a group of people cannot touch it's the one that got the blood of jesus christ in them how did he knows that right here now i'm gonna let go because i'm getting another word by god grace i'm name gonna try to follow these notes i'm gonna try to get the holy ghost to preach hallelujah you know you can say a few things in your own self but when he take over that what makes a difference right here when he when he want to do it now i want him let him do it by the grace of almighty god here so we realized so it started right there in the garden of eden hallelujah when the time before all that's happened you realize before the devil sin was on the earth how we would we how would we be if we lived in our earth well there was no sin here how did you say what you said how you hiding what what would be the thing if there was no sin here how would the people be acting what would they do i would say i will be acting we'll be acting young i think wouldn't be no old people wouldn't be no ball headed people here neither everybody had all teeth in their head and everything that that's what happened we would if we were no sin here we would have no problem how little people you talk about you that blood jewel you said how are you that i well i just can't even think how would a world be with no sin in it but i would tell you what we are we are people say we got to deal with the spirit but how did it get this away because one woman got out of blair she got out of the way she got it in listen to the wrong thing and went down that would cause the problem that was the trouble star day right there and it's going to keep on starting right here the bible says a woman that's born a man is full of days and trouble here don't just don't put it on her but i'm sure that was scary today and that's what we got to deal with and that's why that wasn't the thing so now we need a earthquake how did all these things all these things here that that we go against today all the walls and everything it come from one thing because one person let down the word of god how they let one word let down one word was broke and then the man began to become weird become to come under the influence of demonic spirit now we got to deal with this thing every day you go to work everywhere you go you got to fight your spirit that way you go every time you go shopping you got to watch it somebody want to kill you somebody want to do something how many days one day but by god grace the devil cannot do nothing to you until you got god can't do with you i don't care i'm in the spirit of fight god taking over this world right here by the power of the holy ghost by god grace get what he wanted to do he want to get us under the spirit of fear because he get free enough holy people i told today i said you know you know we were riding down the road and and that was in a and a cat run across and when the blackhead i said i thought it was a black cat but it was great and i said i said he told her i told my wife i said you know how they we used to believe we used to believe if a black a black hat a black black cat run across it's bad scene and then people you remember that somebody break a mirror and a mirror become oh man i'm gonna have seven years of bad i said you know why that thing work here that that it does not it's nothing to it but when you say the word and say that word it's sally i broke a mural and now i'm gonna have seven years of trouble how do you the devil didn't do that you done that because you the one said it how do you believe it you know i don't never say i if i broke a mirror it's just a broke mirror hello i'm not going to put up my you curse your own self hello we curse our own self by the way oh my we say the word sometimes we say something and we cuss our own self and we say god done it told me anything the devil put on him he didn't do let the man say one time he said was that man was there and that's what he was saying here you know what he said he was the devil was there crying and he said devil what's wrong with you why are you crying he said you recall people putting on me and stuff i didn't do how do you know what people do they get yeah we don't say anything we say words sometimes they get us in trouble and rewrite that's how the devil know what we want to thank you he wanted to see you this time he wants you to say things to get your word to curse your own self right everybody well you got power to do it you got power to create too hard if you believe in the supernatural you got to have power to believe god could do it i think people the only way that god can do it you must believe first you must have faith in god first how many people when god wanted to challenge something here you got to be ready for the challenge how about god great but hear you so the things started there started in genesis and everything there and god realized he looked down and he said now he said the world is going all the sin and demonic spirit were running through the earth now god had a plan he said i got a plan here he said red so what did he say he had an earth now when god put the earth there he had a purpose for the earth how did the earth does not eat the earth did you now just disappear jump here in the system like that god created it here and when god created it and god said now don't put it here now god say here i'm gonna what i'm gonna tell you what i'm gonna do i'm gonna speak i'm gonna put life on this earth how the things growed hallelujah supernaturally started growing how did the earth had season and it started to manifest how you know to hear how you know these seeds is manifested look outside all this tree all the lights and everything you i lonely trees been here that one tree died nothing raised back up how did we treat we cannot get rid of it i knew god got it all in his control here how did god got everything in his control here and they that their trees their name they would grow up plants grow he gave it to us it was down but he had a purpose for it it didn't everything that god do he always has a purpose why he done it i mean he just don't just create things just to be playing around he had a purpose in him things were growing everything let there be light let that be seed let that break for a tree and that tree out of all those things that god had in his mind he had a certain tree in his mind and god said i got this tree right here for one purpose one day i'm gonna have to take this tree and i'm gonna have to die and i'm going to pay the price for the whole world sin how did god know what he was doing when he done this thing here holly but the devil didn't know that he thought he had him here on and that was a way but he had up he had to it's a it's alone he had to fulfill this thing and the way he just did not pray into he just one day he just said well i'm gonna do it now but god had a certain way he's gonna do it how did he gonna bring his side how did god come down to the flesh how did he bring his body in the flood by the spoken word how if god spoke the word holy but you said long the world was smoking let that be but he had to have somewhere to manifest himself a little bit one day he's standing up a man named isaiah he's a birdie shepherd see how when he said that he released the power of god that word had to come flesh then there's nothing to stop it look how long it took it to happen we thought it would have happened right then how did that what it is we don't want to wait on god and we get impatient with god when god say the word you can believe it it's going to come to pass he said well they didn't come to pass but so and so they died and they didn't fall down i want to tell you people when god say that when god speak the word it's going to come to pass hallelujah isaiah's virgin a fruit that should raise more of a child and that word now i want you to know look how low we talk how did it happen here we've seen all kinds of things manifested here we've seen abraham manifested here how did abraham brought up the revelation of that word and he began to walk with that word and he'd walk with that word so powerful he knows what they hey you said abraham didn't do a lot of miracles he didn't do what he didn't do what moses did like that but abraham had something that that moses didn't do neither uh you said brother you say i see i see moses moses type you i say yeah but also you look what abraham did abraham done something supernatural hallelujah abraham had this name abraham i think he was 90 something year 89 years old so he he had a son how his body had got too old the word his body had done well he had no way of having this child at all holly but god was coming to earth so he had to break up he had to bring revelation down so he could catch what was going on in his mind hallelujah what he said there so here go abraham he believed in that and he believed god's word he walked with god he had faith in god and now the way one day god looked at him and said i'm gonna tell you what you do here he said abraham i'm gonna tell you you're gonna have a son amen 90 years old come on man that don't happen and if it do happen i like to see it myself but in a real yeah you know but it you say brother can i if god say it could it could happen right now but but by god grace i you know i want to start being as dead as my head to 69 but but but god want to do it i said lord you can do it and my wife she if she won't have one i can say lord she's shaking the head no okay love but but you know that what god wanted to do had that kind of faith so he said abraham had this baby and in his old age the bible said he had this baby here in his old that what was he doing he was showing the coming of christ coming more and more and more to come into play hallelujah what he did so he met he he had that son and one day he told he told her he told either he said he said let's go up there and worship now i would say when he went to worship when he went to carry that son up there to worship i'm gonna tell you what he had to sneak up there because if he would have tried to do that it would have been a fight he wouldn't have got to do that it would have been a real bad fight she would he would have had to kill her but he said we're going to go there and worship how did he know he did not know he was going to raise he said he said but he had word he spoke the word of god and he believed what he said he said we went up there he said he said we're going to go there and we're going to worship and we're going to return back honey that's faith speaking people that's supernatural in that way did he got that on that place here now realize what the story is over here it was bringing the head of type there and then what was he what he said they got up there on that mountain now in the other way what did he say party abraham began to realize i wonder what's wrong with him we're going to church we didn't have a bible today hallelujah you know what he realized he didn't realize something was going he was he raised in the message and the way he's thinking what's going on down here you know what he said he looked at everybody abraham looked at his son he said father you need the father let me ask you a question he said what's what's the sacrifice well i got you know where i see this thing taking place lord what is the sacrifice in other words you know what he wanted to know he want to know what's going on how do you know what he realized he ain't got no knife he ain't got no fire ain't got none you know what he didn't know what would get red tape but all he know love father was but anyway he went up on that mountain right there hallelujah then he said him and he took him tied him he laid him down he was going to kill him he was going to kill him but by faith god the word of god stepped in holy what he said he was going to do it in other words oh when he got ready to pull that knife down the thunder's opened up the father god broke loose in that earth and when he did he realized no creative power took place hallelujah by the word of god he created a uh uh a ram a sacrifice hello a rain i say that rain that it was created it did not have to he did not it it was that rain it was a grown it was ready for the soccer ball he didn't have to be born that day that but he came through the smoking word he released the power of god that was in him and it brought a lamb and that was in he had something with skin on it you said brother what did they have what did they have to do with them what did they have with the coming of god how do you know i said that bro he was right he was writing the bible he was writing it in the past what he was saying he was using the revelation of the same spirit of god he was saying jesus was saying saint john 3 16 without uh without saying you know he was using that type right there he would tell him this is the way he was going to bring that tight right there god so loved his world god so loved it where he gave his only begotten son when that when he done that he was bringing that revelation to pass by the word of god and that word had to come to pass because god had spoken the word through a man named abraham and that way god supernatural brought this boy brought this boy to come out and brought him out highly showing you that god is still the same yesterday the day of everybody we got to have that kind of faith in god we got to see god live people this is not just a play around church message this is not this message got power on it you got the holy ghost in it if you believe the word of god all things are possible hallelujah amen and then we realize here and be getting closer and closer they begin to manifest it we see these things happen then they think you know moses moses stepped up and he he began to manifest his revelation through the same word god spoke to moses like god hallelujah moses was like god hallelujah where he was he was showing him coming down coming more forming more close and closer to flesh but one day holly out of all those types and things that was coming it was gonna come a revelation one day he was gonna come out of the word the word gonna have to become flesh how did he had to have flesh on it right now it was so he been being being spoken and spoken and being carried and carried on down and right but right now he's coming to the revelation of the world he's going to have to have flesh on him he's a god that got flesh on him hallelujah what he did in other words after so long with time he was spoken now it's time for god to come down from flesh from the spirit real life from the spirit of revelation to flesh holy when he come in the flesh here now when he come in to flood people he come in the flesh where he come into flood to fight the same devil he had that we could fight he didn't know he now when he come to earth he didn't come in there like just uh with nothing going on he was coming here to deal with the demons that we got to deal with how did you gonna deal with the spirit of the demon if you don't know how to hide what he deal with but when he grew and god brought him down he brought him down so he could know how it feel to be a man hallelujah that way if he would have been god we wouldn't be able to look at it when he was deaf hear me gritty come out there you had to meet him by the power of almighty god you couldn't have touched that mountain you would have died everything was too holy to look at him you couldn't look at god on his face he had to die you would die but now he came down so he could be hounded he come and talk all flesh now hello by the almighty god but you really come down there where he now he got away he trying to manifest himself in the flesh now now what he did he had to make hit the hell away the word had to be made manifested how did one day one day you know it's time to put it put that seed into something let that seed come to life so he can come and fulfill this purpose and that word then what he did and she uh where we find the story here here goes a little girl named mary she was out there know that she didn't know she she gonna have to she didn't know that she was gonna be the one that god was gonna choose to let to have that baby uh that way she didn't have no idea this thing holly she was not looking for god god was looking for her how did you know here she was going down there and there was no doubt not realizing that all of a sudden the power of god the spirit of god messed a mess around an angel of the lord stepped up saying mary hallelujah she said what's going on lord what is going on holly and he was telling us said mary he said mary you found fable she's thinking i did you didn't know when you found grace you didn't know where you found grace god some of us in the word some of us in the world doing all kind of spiritual demonic power and one day the word of god called you out holy you didn't know they ever gonna have it but all of a sudden something supernatural tough place how did the supernatural power called you one day honey by the power of the holy ghost you didn't know what's gonna happen i didn't know how i wasn't looking for god a matter of fact i was drunk the day before that but by the power of god god met me people i would tell god if you ever get a holy ghost you ever get feeling the holy ghost it'll hold you all the way people do not get we begin to look at you what you say i say it when you get the holy ghost it'll hold your people holy don't let the devil try to tell you your mind if god gives you that thing it'll hold you until the death of your redemption people and then he says he got me done and now with mary she was done and he said mary he said oh he began to break that seven and he began to reveal himself to mary and mary remember didn't realize he said maybe you're gonna have a baby she said wait a minute i don't even know a man i'm still a virgin right that would have been but now he says mary you don't have to but this thing that's going to be in you is of the holy ghost he told her she probably this thing was it was it was too heavy for me america she was trying to she trying to figure out how this thing gonna happen i don't even know a man hallelujah rest away she was looking at but god knew how to get a mind so god said to him he said mary he said at this time he you remember he had to show us something he had to show us something he had to break something else he had to break a seal right then because she couldn't get it together he said mary do you remember your uh your cousin she said yeah i remember her i remember her real good last time i saw her she couldn't hardly walk he never was he was too old too i know i don't understand that what that got to do with in a word she said do you remember them in that hole oh there she said yes i remember that he said mary at this time she's already pregnated with a diet john had to be a heart before jesus could come because he could not come himself among 3 7 had to be first he had to be the one over him he had to be the one to break it no so he had everything within order he had to wait till he said spoke the word yeah hallelujah when he said it then he said when she said that what did she say it ain't nothing else for me to do be it unlord i believe it in the name of jesus christ when the word of god come revelation here ain't nothing you could do say lord i'm giving my heart to you right now i'm giving it to you right now in the supernatural power of god moving right now and i worked in the dinner all of a sudden here she was now she had to have this baby this baby right here you said wha what was the difference between jesus having a baby and another woman i said jesus here he had a baby without sensation he had a baby without a sensation he had a baby that was not born with worms in him hallelujah because if he had worms he could have saw he woulda could have had worm didn't he he didn't work you know what he could have died and he could have went to the grave and worm but he didn't have none he was perfect buddy he had a perfect body even though that body was going to be how did he get sin and he had to eat food food build body and build that so he didn't eat anywhere so you know what he knew what that's why he didn't know god had to come to clear revelation high field to be a man how did he wanted to know how it feels to be a man how did it because how did god make intercession for the world because he knew how yet feel for a sinner to go he know when you're going through your word he know when you're going through the demonic power he know where you're going to almost run and kill yourself the only thing that goes through their mind he knows how to deal for you he know how to pay for you that way he had to go there he'd come and show up hallelujah how to overcome the power of god teaching us how to overcome in his age how did it so we he goes there you know where he was born and he was born a baby a baby but even in a baby he was in supreme control of everything now he might not realize you know god knew all things but some things that god did even in the flesh here in the flesh here he had he he began to realize he began to get he began to recognize something different he was supernatural he could not he could not undermine we didn't he had the bible say he had to learn how he had and everything like that so he what he did he began to begin to walk and he began to realize the power of god when i say the word something take place i don't care what i say if i say in the name of jesus christ these demons got let go when i say lord in the name of jesus christ when the word of god come in your mouth you say lord in the name of jesus christ i believe that you're

draw that i say well i told the dad to dance i'm going to go down i'm going to have a heart checked out they checked it out they couldn't find one thing wrong but they just they just say they just had they really didn't have a reason why she died but i know why she died she god had to give her a chance hello god had power over there people here but i don't know why man let me get back in my mind right here about god great but yeah i'm gonna let you know jesus christ still the same yesterday today in favor we got to realize we got to come to that point people we got to quit playing with the thing like god ain't got power i want to tell you he got a lot of power we didn't learn how to submit to it you'll see the power of god moving all that but we don't get so people that we live in this air so long and we don't got all this uh technology we got everything here everything we do we gotta look it up oh you know you know how to do it you need to have faith in god god needs you to trust him every way people you gotta hold on to the word of god hallelujah then he did him but we realized that so after he done these things right here began to come closer and closer to the flesh he been trying to come close to the flesh god didn't become in the flesh well hallelujah he came on you now you're walking on that earth you know how he living as a man like me and you eating like me and you eating fighting the same bottle that we fight every day here but he had a purpose for doing it if he had a purpose and he had something that he didn't know that nobody know he had a purpose and that wasn't in that body jesus christ went one of the most demonic fighting him more than any man like you ever seen don't you think that he had a heart that he had to eat look at it when he got when he got ready he was on the up on that out there in the desert he went to a great battle right he went to a great battle like no man ever went through he would tell him fight him by his mind fight him hard too if that be the man hungry when a man get hungry he'll do anything but probably god said man hungry enough he eat out of garbage cans i didn't know what but he that's how you do it he was he was dying and then jesus the devil came to say if not be now like he's trying to make him doubt trying to make him doubt who he is how did he know that he said he said if not be the son of god command that this stone be made of brilliant you say that come on you can't do no bad net devil all he had to do was pick up a rock and say bread it could have been bred all over the earth i believe by god he could have done that but he he would not come in the glorified for the devil he come to the glory of god how did he say without he said he told anything he said man should not live by bread alone by every word but see now the mouth of god and that broke the power of the devil then the devil said oh i got to try you again boy and the devil turned around and brought him to try to get him to drop down over a bit of a building and try to make him committed since committed uh suicide but what did what he did don't you do that devil don't even try that don't you even try to tip me but the major attempt was when he said i give you the world right everything you want right now all you got to do is just fly down fly down and make me god that what he was asking them to do if you make me god i'll give you everything you want i give you all the jury you want i let you women's do any kind of way you want to dress you can do anything you want to do oh you got to live like the devil you can have anything you want hallelujah that what he wants you to do to sell your soul to the devil people young people you need to keep yourself clothed by the word of god young people you need to better collect that word of god we better let go of these things in the world these these so many things on these radios and there's music and stuff that coming out here people you better run from a lot of this stuff demonic power got the real strong music everything else to try to get us mind off guard every pictures and all the pictures we look at today holly how many things did we see today we got to fight against those demon spirits when you look at these people half naked and all these things people don't ain't going to fight you the rest of your life you need to keep your mind keep your mind covered keep your mind covered by the blood of jesus christ how many people i'm realizing i'll fight this ain't battle don't tell i'm not going to i'm a man too but i got to learn how to resist the devil you will not will fight this battle without learning get the revelation today us how to fight this battle but he's going to be he's going to be the one they're going to win by god grace and we realize that you see it the power of god hate was operating his word he walked on this earth and done these things right here by the power of the holy spirit in that word so he that what he been doing he been showing us these things right here and by god gracious then we realized so he's getting close and close he's getting old time is coming it's time to come he's going to take everything he had a power of god he said i'm going to get every gonna i'm going to take all my power and everything i got and i'm going to show the bride what i could do with this word holy by god grace you say brother you said but now i realize him but look at him when john come on the scene how did john was a great man here but john didn't have the power that god had he had the same faith but he didn't have the power that he had but by god grace he said but at the end john said i must decrease and he increased highly by the power of god how he look at our prophet when he come on the word of god he got that same revelation he thought i must decrease so god can increase him the power of god is on the increase right now here i let probably recognize he gonna come a time lord you i'm gonna i'm gonna move out of the way and the holy ghost gonna take over the place he knew that the prophet of god understood that word he know how to operate the power of the holy ghost and holy god move for it because god he realized when that time come he said i gotta i gotta decrease yeah so god could increase he's gonna be one of those on earth at one time he's gonna be now he's gonna be him god gonna be the supreme deity over this world he's gonna be the supreme power of this word yes hell about god grace hallelujah i'm taking that by the power of god hallelujah praise the lord ain't got none of my clothes in here but uh hallelujah i wouldn't realize here in that word so we realized god trying to get us under his control by the word of god hallelujah it come to time we got to get him to the tree now we got to get him closer to it holly but jesus before he got down i'm just bringing this bringing it when he before he got down to to the place to die he'd done a lot of supernatural things yeah he done a lot of supernatural thing people the same ministry that you've seen in that prophet do he was doing the same thing how he gave him the same authority use that gift like you sure show them show them props show that prophet how to use them gifts that prophet stood there and he done it one by one showing you that jesus christ is the man and that word that was given his mind that the prophet had highly it was not brother bran and my it was god man there was god inside a man it was the man he did not he said i let the man of god his mind let the mind that was in christ be in you he said he would he would he'd be giving him his man he would let him have his mind god took his mind over hallelujah what god done that probably was not his mind doing it that was god speaking through the prophet that's how he does no man can create no man can create i mean you show me one do it you say oh i could i could no you ain't you would never find nobody could create an animal and then turn around and eat it that's right turn around here i'm telling people that's the power of the holy ghost that is not man that's god in man holly not what so i'm realizing he realized these things but real life at the end of the day at the end of the day every man had to go in and give us they don't have to die you're either going to die supernaturally or you're gonna die physically but every one of us is gonna have to die but by god grace we but if we are in christ we can't die amen hallelujah you just been absent from the flesh is to be present with god hallelujah we got to get that revelation you got babies so many people i find today people so scared of death and drink and germs and things that's going on even this stuff about all this war and stuff some people about to have a heart attack i mean what to use what you're wearing about it for how do they blow you up you're going to be out of here anyway so you might well get ready you can't you can't stop what the devil trying to do here you might want to let him do his thing but by his grace remember him at the end of the day he gonna pay for it the thing that he doesn't done that day he gonna pay for it so just let him go and do it highly by god grace but do not do not be so unreferral people so much on the fear of the day they cannot function right every time i see people today every time my spirit get on them they say oh every time i something hit him oh brother i think i got this disease i think you just now curse your own self you just not spoke a devil in your own body right now you're killing your own self highly by god grace man i'll just say lord i'm giving it to you lord and that's why i'm letting you do it lord by the power of the holy ghost by god grace people we got to keep that kind of faith to overcome in this area how do you if you get don't start getting so it's so nervous hey just nervous everybody on the nerve and they cannot hold up their faith because some disease power comes and it sit there and get in your mind and you can't get rid of it you need to cast that thing down i don't care how powerful that devil is you need to say in the name of jesus christ say that get rid of me get behind me devil have you got the power to speak the word yeah that what are you trying to get to do he's trying to get us to use the word hell he didn't know the word let it come a time that jesus had to come come down to that point that he wanted to pay the price of his own body he don't have to take his body his body he wanted his body he had to die you know man jesus had to die hallelujah to order up for him he had the only way that the world could ever be separate brought separated from sin and separate us from sin somebody got to die we needed somebody to die hallelujah by god grace and all these good prophets there they died and everything but they died and they stayed in the grave hallelujah they didn't they didn't come back and they'd done that but diego won here it had to be somebody that could die they could come back and and and pay and cleanse it and give us a revelation of the word and give us souls and clean us up and and everything like that we didn't have that kind of power to do it only one blood in this world that could do this thing hey but only one blood that can give us eternal life that's almighty god anybody one blood that can give you the holy ghost right now it's only the blood of jesus christ is the only thing that can clean you right now how you by the power of the holy ghost it's the only thing that could clean you right now is right now the blood of jesus christ ain't nothing take away my sin but the blood of jesus christ that way we got to get in the blood the blood is the only thing that could clean us right now oh holy little people jesus and he had to get to that tree he had to get to that tree he brought he followed down through the edges and everything else and the mystery of god and all these great revelations of the word you know where he told us all these things but now it's time for him to come down oh boy that must have been a rough time when you know that you got to be the one that i got to give your body to be at the sacrifice for the world wonder what it'd be like you knew you had to die from the world for the world holy jesus had a battle it was not an easy bout of people's amen it was not an easy battle you know sometimes we look at where jesus he died people you just don't realize what kind of power what kind of demonic power he had to fight against his flesh was fighting in his body and when he went in the gas and guessing uh guessing uh trying to kill that place like what in the in in the in the oh in that was praise god try to catch it praise god you know what you say now you said brother what they did that's what the devil tried to do he tried to tell me i've been fighting and trying to get trying to get everything in my mind and everything about you he constantly trying to take my thoughts i you know every time i get ready to start pre he tried to attack me but he a lie in the way in the name of jesus i'm not going to let him have my mind and now him brother sam ain't going to let him have his mind we're not giving it to him in the name of jesus we're going to hold on to the word of god we're not giving the devil nothing people honey if he get it he's going to oh

here today buddy holy day what he wanted to try to get you to stop preaching the word of god he trying to stop me today but by the name of jesus christ i stand against you in the name of jesus and i'll rebuke you devil but try that though how about the power of god do what you want to do you want to get us down and beat us down and begin to try because he don't want you to say no he don't want you he don't want you to keep your mind because he wants you you know what he if he can't stop you then i can try to if i can't stop you then i'll stop you talking he's trying to find a way to try to get rid of us all the time but we're not going to let him have it in the name of jesus christ we're not going to let him have it by his script we are healed in the name of jesus and anybody else oh you got to raise up so i'm going to claim my healing right now in the name of jesus christ yes that's your right people but jesus had to deal with that thing he had to fight that spirit it's time for him to get down to the end of it yes it's time for the end to come to it oh man you think about he knowing he he fighting he and the nuts and that up that that garden it was not easy it was not easy that's what he had to overcome me yeah you said brother what i said he had to overcome then and where he had he had to make himself ready to die hallelujah let me i had this scripture i can't remember which one it is right now but by god grace in gethsemane in that word let me see can i find it but i think it was in yeah 20 27 uh yeah 27 of matthew but jesus says here he said he's in the garden yeah saint matthew 27 chapter and verse 46 i think this wordy what jesus said sir he's he's the man if i read a few places of it matthew 27 i might didn't write that one down yeah i don't think i did he said he jesus when he got at the end he was he was dying that grunt he was there let me just find it myself and praise god and he's going through this battle now it's one of the greatest battle that's ever been fought for the man concerned he fighting against the mind hallelujah in other words in other words he said about the knife out of the ninth hour out of jesus christ loud for saying i cannot alley so what did somebody now said he said that is to say god my god why has that forsaken me what did you feel like the deal how you feel man he going and he realized he's he's fighting as a man he's not fighting his god he's fighting as a man he's trying to he's gonna have to make a decision because this decision right here gonna prove if he don't go along with the rest of everybody's

people i'm another drug that's getting closer more more closer drug that i just seen than even any drug i don't deal with i'm talking one of the most powerful drugs i've ever seen that there were you see more people's is addicted to it than anything else you say what that is ain't got it though that that thing right there let me see that thing now ain't gonna hit nothing but you know what i'm saying this thing right here got more people's trap right here more than anything else man i tell you people getting out of people having wrecks and cars and killing and doing and they and you know i don't know what's wrong they cannot break that path the devil got your mind that's right he don't want your mind because he know this is the hour that god said i'm going to let the mind that was in christ being you but i got a way to get to your mind if he could control your mind he got your body holly by the power of god do not let this be your god amen you said brother i said you might well if you can't howling you better get rid of it because i realize i ain't saying i got family people because i ain't gonna call god my ain't gonna say too much to get in trouble but i'm gonna have to hit the spirit this thing right here ever they can't even get out of school and do anything else as soon as they go home they get to stand in there and they stays and then they look in and they look at they go to bed they wake up they get up they're looking again they get up they go to eat they can't eat man i have a friend of mine they were cutting the grass how they couldn't even cut the grass and trying to dry i said hey y'all see my yard how can you cut the yard and look at one another i was upset i said boy look at that thing right here trying to cut the grass and look at it insane that don't work in it though but that's a powerful spirit people yeah i'm just you know i'm just dealing down with the common stuff today but it's the true anyway but god did not make give you a mind to

give me they said bro you don't never holly don't holly call me especially in that thing they say i don't know how to do a deal with it because if i know how to deal with i'll probably be messing with it i said but thank god i said i'm not trying though but by god grace there's nothing wrong with it like brett red say he could have been used the right way if you could have used the tb right way it

other man we all don't been through that but by god's grace we all been young i'm gonna tell you through my life a few things i'm gonna tell you whatever you do you got to keep god on you on your side because once you go out there and now i was not raised in the church i went i went to church a couple times with my uh she raised me i went to church and i tried to i went to church all i did was went to church my body was there but my mind wouldn't yeah it was good to go to church your mind ain't there and everything but anyway but i'm just gonna tell them a few little things to y'all young people to help you but anyway i let that demon got me and i started off didn't want to go to church and they said you know i i started hanging around with guys that were parting and and the first time someday my power began to overtake my body one time i was there when it really took a hole we were together and they said won't you try these needles don't you don't you listen to that that devil's going to destroy he's going to take everything you got how the people don't you never young people to let they grab you by the power of god when that spirit begin to try to you you find you find your

great-aunt died so i was on my own i didn't have to give to nobody i did what i want to do when i want to do i worked a little bit but still but that drug just done it that first time and it feeled it good but the in the end part of it was it was not good it was not good and that was that thing began to lead me uh i was from probably 12 i started a little smoke but i'mma tell you i'm just being honest with you i want you to realize because while i got some young people i'm going to preach today that'll be about a few minutes and i'm going to be out of here and don't get i want you to realize this thing is real once i've done it it feels so good so i'm going to try it again you're always trying to i'm going to quit the next time no it don't quit that's right it ain't no quit it's the power of god to deliver you from that spirit once that demon get ahold of you you are you are a slave for it how do you begin now in other words you cannot break that spirit i used to try to quit one day i say when sometimes i get right i went to a baptist church one day i mean uh no pentecostal church that brother would he was there he was casting out demons and peoples i said well i think i'll try that so i went up there and he said well he put his hand on my afro i had afro i had a big ol afro and i thought i got ready but i'm ready for it i said come on i said if you don't knock me down i'm going to be i have attitude because everybody ever fallen out but me so he put it in there and he did it like this and me and him were wrestling and he wrestling around i guess he must have got tired i know i got back up they asked me he said what what did you get out of a messed up afro but that would happen and i thought i could get free myself i thought i could get free so i tried all these things my cousin then they went to they they tried all these places going in places try to get clean they get clean for six months they come back out they're doing the same rain i didn't ever go to one in places like that but yet still it got down to that point young people that god i needed somebody they had power they can deliver yes and everything i'm just gonna listen to say a few things to get right parachute so and it was so i began to begin to try to get delivered i had through that time i was in a car rate 1980 me and my buddy hit a tree doing a hundred miles now bust his brain out i
