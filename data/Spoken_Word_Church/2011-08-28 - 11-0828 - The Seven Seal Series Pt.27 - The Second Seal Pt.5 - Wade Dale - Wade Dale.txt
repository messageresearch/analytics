glasses just fell off his he start sweat already already already listen I thank everybody for doing a good job at makes you really steady I mean makes you focus on what's going on all right chapter 6 Book of Revelation hello anybody home back there yes sir what are we doing we got circus going on today happy to be here yes yeah I'm happy to be here too it's you're truy good to see you today and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see and there went out another horse that was red and power was given to him that sat there on to take peace from the earth and they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword now we understand that that um combat Beast with the ox we talked about that last Sunday all right so I don't think we shouldn't have to go over any of this let's kind of go one step further and look at the horse the horse being red now we know the horse was red now let's turn in your seal book to the second seal now get in the second seal now okay and let's go to page 173 our paragraph 175 in the second seal all right make sure you're in the second seal if in his first s you will be okay it's page 173 if you've got this regular book but it's paragraph 175 180 the can't be 175 just give a paragraph number yeah paragraph 175 everybody got it where it says what was it got it oh I'm sorry my glasses are horrible paragraph 115 I can't see a thing with these glasses on why do youall think when I was preaching last Sunday I was down there with you so I could figure out who was here and who was not I couldn't tell who was here think that's a joke it's really not these glasses are for reading and their heart's not very good for reading anymore now y'all finally got the right paragraph how are you huh 51 and Le well that look like 175 but it's 115 all right so we're here now what was it now we're talk he was talking about Moses Moses went out to deliver the children of Israel right he goes up to Pharaoh he's got the power of God in his hand he's got the word of God in his mouth he drops that snake down and the snake does what I mean the the rod turns into a snake then he's then Janice and jambus which is an impersonator the impersonators come in they drop theirs down and they become a snake too they were just magicians all right they didn't cause that to happen they were just magicians you see it you know even now people doing magic like that and slide of hand but Moses now what could Moses do what was it it was a showing that every genuine thing of God the devil has got an impersonator for it they impersonate to throw the people off the track now what did Moses do say well I guess I made a mistake I better go back no he just stood still for he had carried out his commission to the letter now go to one 18 now Antichrist comes in light gradually excuse me now what did he come in first White calm cool white righteous Church everything's okay we're going to be all right let's just put church and state together and then when he got that established in the people then what happened as God moves higher the devil moves with him just like he said right here the impersonators were always there the impersonators are always with you mhm right so we're not immune from this the white righteous Church the little attitudes that we have sometime maybe may seem righteous but in God's eyes are they okay are you know in God's eyes are they are we trying to get somewhere I think about this weekend um we went over J's dad's for this for the weekend just had a time to kind of sit down and relax and I thought you know is it works is it something is it how many quotes we read a day or how much is it that have we come down to that I don't think so is it is it something we got to do if it's works then Paul said that's dead but but by my faith you're going to see my works okay so what's happening in the message now is there's a lot of impersonators that are doing the works like I said last Sunday they got the mechanics and everybody in this message has got the mechanics because they can read listen people when I was 14 years old I knew it was sex in the garden I could read that in the in the Bible and from what I saw what brother brandham said but did I have a revelation no I just had head knowledge you know why cuz my fruit showed different up until so many years ago right I had a head knowledge of this message at 14 years old that never left me but it was just head knowledge it was just mechanics that's we don't want that we don't we got to have the mechanics you got to have it there but you got to have the Dynamics on top of that mechanics we got to get the two together just like remember uh Constantine got the church and the state together we've got to get the word and the spirit together all right and start believing that what this says is true and then what act on it in the book of Acts what did they do they acted on what Jesus taught them for 3 and 1/2 years those 120 went out and acted on what he had said cuz they knew what they knew the Holy Ghost was already come they knew it wasn't coming it was already there same way with you and I same way with this these seals the change of the body my point is the change of the body is already here like dad's been preaching on the adoption the understanding of the change of the body is here now let's go a little bit higher then all right you got mechanics but no Dynamics you can have mechanics with Dynamics like I said upstairs be born again but remember I read the quote out of that out of that true seed will come a group of people that's going to have mechanics and Dynamics not different than when you were born again but a higher Revelation everybody understand because when you when you people don't understand sometimes when you say well we got mechanics and no dynamics that means we got just a word and no Spirit no if you're born again this me this somewhere and Quicken what you heard whether it be just a little that of God everybody understand so we don't we're not walking around with no Dynamics we're walking around with partial Dynamic we need perfect Dynamics cuz the perfect Dynamics is going to change this body right cuz brother Brandon had an understanding of the change of the body right Paul had a understanding that somebody was going to be changed but they didn't have the Dynamics of that time it wasn't time yet the Dynamics was not on that d on that mechanic I'm trying to do if dad and him still leaving in a couple weeks I'm going to do both Sunday services and speak on for and latter rign cuz it needs to be brought out to where you can understand that like I said Sunday when we're talking about things down here sometimes you you can take me wrong just like just like some people did or sometimes they took brother brandom wrong cuz he said well you got mechanics but no Dynamics now that's not exactly the truth do you understand because if you got the Holy Ghost if you're born again somewhere the mechanics you heard met up with the Dynamics of God and he sparked that little bit of of word that you held in your heart that's what happened on the day of Pentecost but now did they have the fullness no they might have had 10% octane where we got to have 100% octane everybody understand it was gas there's different grades of gas gas right regular midgrade and premium well let's just make an analogy we need to be in the premium grade and quit filling up with the regular right cuz a regular you still get like brother Brown said you get a little spark knocking but you use that premium grade we'll get out of here it'd be hard to put regular gas in a rocket it's fuel it Sparks it burns but you won't put regular gas in a in a rocket no you put rocket fuel but guess what it's Dynamic everybody understand all right so now I don't need it today you can have it all my bu sisters or old and not cold warm it warm but you see I don't what I want you to realize is right here Pentecost this is my the next quote Pentecost was true right 1906 ofuda Street the Holy Ghost fell on what they had the word they held the Holy Ghost fell on that and they were born again Believers in the body of Christ sealed away for the age correct let's look down in this next paragraph 121 and look what brother Rand saying let's go excuse me to 120 now the first church when the Catholic Church says that they were the first the original Church they're exactly right they were they began at Pentecost that's where the Catholic Church began now I once didn't hardly believe that till I read history and found out it's right they excuse me they began at Pentecost but they they begin to drift and you see where they're at all right does everybody understand where he's going listen and if Pentecost drift with a speed is drifting now and they won't have to go 2,000 years it's 100 years from now they'll be farther away than the Catholic church is that's right right let me say this if this message keeps going on the way it is it'll be in worse shape than the Pentecost and it is already in worse shape than the Pentecost everybody understand but now that Pentecost was true don't say that Pentecost was false that Pentecost was true the true baptism of the Holy Ghost fell on the word that they had for their day so don't discount those people that's like in this oage you think boy those people they they were just very weak people they just died here no they were a very powerful group of people for their age that's right cuz the call was believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you should be saved be filled with the Holy Ghost and they had signs and wonders but they gave their life for what they believe all right Satan was there but what he had done is he had moved from that white righteous church now let's go to page paragraph sorry 141 watch how Satan moveed now I want everybody understand you understand you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost Every Day Life and die and go to hell on your spirit but if you're ever born again in your soul you do have the spark of God but you may be that sputtering car that he was talking about remember we talked about it upstairs Sunday you be born again but you can declare yourself to go toward the change of the body or hey this is all I can do and die and go by the grave but you one of the two is going to happen or one of the three you're either going to realize you lost didn't have to start with you're going to realize that that you don't have enough Faith or you going to realize that you're the one that's going to be changed those are the three groups of people that's the only three I want to worry about this world I'm telling you people it gets more more unreal as the weeks go on look how powerless those people up that East Coast was boy they got some real powerful people a lot of money a lot of things a lot of big stuff a lot of lot of mansion but guess what one little puff from Irene and they went you know they went in the water well that's just a that's just a that's not even a firecracker compared to what's going to happen and how are they going to be able to handle it in how are we going to be able to handle how are we going to be able to handle that one day we ain't got a place to live can't get gas everybody's preparing for this that and the other all they got to do is take the gas away from us and we ain't got nothing that's right I mean you may put some food up if you want to that's fine and dandy but if you don't got no gas where you going to go what are you going to do gas is everything petroleum products is more than just putting gas in your car mhm right but let's just prepare now just get in word had a good idea the other day you know all the Indians and Muslims or whatever they are bought up all anywhere you go that's who owns he said you know that's could very easily say hey you don't believe the way we believe we don't see and they own every one of them we went in a store the other day that was in Greensboro down where we used to hunt and this old man and woman used to own it and I walked in there and there was an Indian Running mhm Indian owner and he wouldn't take credit card so okay that's your check but that's the truth though but now watch watch how Satan moves what we're trying to do is we're not trying to reveal Satan we're trying to reveal what God has done and to expose what the devil does in our life exposing I know brother Brandon one time says and even the Bible says the wicked one would be revealed reveal means to make known or to it but we're want to expose this guy we want to expose this fell we don't want to we don't want to you know sugarcoat it we want to expose him get him out in the open all right cuz you know what we can deal with him then because what he's doing it through these seals he's hiding in the Deeds the doctrines he's hiding himself I don't care how much you know it's like I said it's works works works get born again first The Works will come I'll promise you that all right paragraph one let's read one 140 now remember the the paragraph above that let's read it cuz that's what dad's been on God's first decision is perfect and the way he chose to do things there can't be no other better way he can't improve on it because it's perfect to begin with so now is God changing because of the devil's tactic no Satan changes because of he sees what God's people's doing he can't understand it he can't understand us that's why he hates us he's understood down Through the Ages but a group of people's going to take a body change see that's the only hold he's got he's got one hole that he's a squatter on this Earth and he can take remember God told him said you will eat the dust of the earth your Serpent and the dust you'll eat the rest of your life well serpents don't eat dust but what did that Ser Point did God tell him God told him you're going to take this away from the human bre this is dust you're going to eat this dust until somebody comes Jesus Christ right we just got to realize one thing that whatever Jesus done it's already finished over with and completed we just got to realize it right now let's skip on down you can't say he learned more he didn't learn more he's very F of all wisdom our wisdom here comes from Satan paragraph 140 We inherited inherited it from Eden where we swapped off faith for wisdom Eve did now he was first called Antichrist all right remember the first the first he was Antichrist all right cuz he was against the word of God even though it was a white righteous Church remember he was he was the Antichrist now the second stage he is called the false prophet because that Spirit among the people became incarnate right you remember the White Horse now had no Crown when he started but then he would was given a crown why he was a nickan spirit to begin with then he became incarnate in a man he's talking about a pope and then he was crowned and received the throne and was crowned and when he served that for a long time as we'll see the seals break and then we find out after that long time Satan was kicked out of heaven he came down according to the scriptures and enthroned himself just think enthroned himself in that man and became a beast now he's talking about going you know later on so now let's stop right there so s so now it went from Antichrist to false prophet because what does a false prophet do what did Bam do bam preached the word of God to a degree bam was a prophet even though he was false he was a prophet the Bible says false prophets will come in the end time false preachers false prophets all right prophesying of things to come Satan's always wanting to do what brother Brown said what's what does man always do he's looking for something to come or saying well that was good back there and forgetting that God's right here right that's Satan's tactic even with me and you remember like Sunday if you prophesy that oh man there's a group of people that's going to take a body change then you're dead you're dead you just killed yourself because you're prophesying of a group of people to come right you're prophesying of a group of people to come and that puts you out of that group so you die those who prophesy must die because they're prophesying of somebody coming but when that one person when you know when they prophesied of Jesus coming then we stood on the earth he said I am here I am the resurrection before Abraham was I am well not that flesh they were looking at but the man inside of there that theophany God was there the whole time that's why he could tell them things now where's that the offing God now he in heaven looking you know walking around waiting on something to happen no he's in the bride he's in Bride form now I don't even like to say that we're different because we're we're this is God in Bride form this is not a bride that's become another form of God this is God in Bride form this makes it positive this is God it's not God coming not God will do something no it's God in Bride form right now cuz he was in what father son Holy Ghost if you and I have the Holy Ghost that's the three dispensations of God but this end time people has one more thing that we got to deal with and that's this guy out here nobody else has had to deal with this man this this flesh person all right we'll read that in just a little bit we'll read it but he now is a false prophet because what can he do now remember the first age or the first seal he was not crowned yet but a crown was given brother R said it had to come into a a being a person then that you can't Crown spirit so now there's a man there and it's Crown all right now what's that man doing watch him develop same Rider different horse remember the horse is the power that the people give it cuz if people would have rose up and said hey we're not killing these Christians it wouldn't have happen but but what happened that false prophet the Antichrist false prophet is a person they they put a head up there put a crown on top of him and then what happened was this became more powerful than this because the written word of God said this but the Pope says this or the Catholic Church says this why if this overtakes you this is more powerful right the word of God is more powerful okay and we know it's a person we know it's Jesus Christ we know all that but if it's not in you it's powerless same way with Satan it's powerless unless that word is made manifest in somebody and and we believe that when God spoke it can't come back void it can't be changed or made any different okay but now Satan changes watch him he'll change four times why he couldn't get them all in the White Horse can't going he ain't going to get them all in the red horse he's not going to get them all on the black horse but he's going to get them all in the Pale Horse all of his people that is his his subject okay but what was he to do take peace and kill and the red horse was R riding through the blood of 68 million Martyrs that he killed but he killed more brother Bown said spiritually he killed more than he did physically why because the doctrine went forth it got amongst the people there's your false prophet because a false prophet is somebody that now stands here and preaches the word of God and you accept it as Doctrine you accept the word as a Doctrine and it becomes part of you then Satan does what he kills you takes peace and kill this is divide and conquer why you see the old Pope doing this you know that's not a victory sign that's divide and conquer he's taking peace and he's killing so the fourth age next week we're going to talk about the blood and how that that works in sanctification but how it took that group of people that was in this Dark Age and shows how that you and I are going to overcome I hope we can get to that next Sunday if not maybe the following Sunday but we'll get into those people how that they you we we have to take those four combat beasts and we have to connect with all four of them those four combat beasts were given to the bride I believe to get us out of here cuz brother brandham said after the four seal he said I knew the Rapture took place cuz in the fifth seal you don't see the combat Beast anymore where were they they were in the bride and you don't see them anymore so that must mean the bride's gone pretty simple but it was very profound because nobody ever realized that that the four combat beasts were actually given to the Bride of Jesus Christ to get us out of here cuz let's surmise one thing if we're gone somebody took a body chain that's right so somebody's got to do it whether we read scripture or whether we do anything we know after the foreal if we're not seen anymore then somebody come to place all this comes to adoption all this comes to the higher form of justification sanctification baptism holy all this that's why that the red horse I mean the White Horse red horse and Pale Horse mix together I mean the black horse mixed together makes the Pale Horse justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost makes way for the Holy Ghost himself which is going to do one thing and that's change your body cuz you can't do it Abraham couldn't do it but one day he woke up and it happened so that's just the same way with you and I walk in the word know that we're Justified I want us to really understand if you if you don't know that you've been Justified and all of us have a problem that's we all can remember our past we all can remember the things that we've done but remember God came you know if I was God I'd be scratching my head and I'd say why are you thinking of why why you thinking that I took care of that a long time ago okay but I know that's but see the devil has one inroad he can come down through your brain right and you lived it that's right that's why I said that's why that I'm like Dad I just cannot see us having any form of eternal life while we were doing the things we were doing we were Sinners lost even Paul says we were alienated from the Commonwealth of God we were alienated from anything of God life now if Paul could realize that why don't people in the message realize that we were lost I did what I did cuz I didn't have God to right but he began your body change once he took that same body and turned it like I've said many times before this hand held many well I didn't drink beer a lot but this hand did things it wasn't supposed to do the one finger sign and all that stuff that was s same same hand same mouth but what did God do he began your body you begin your body change when you're begin when you're born again because your body begins to become subject to the one inside of you it was before subject to the one that was inside of you which was the devil right all right but then it becomes subject to the one inside of you and sure we make mistakes because we have a spirit Spirit we have a human spirit that we have to deal with which is memory reason we reason memory our memory from before conscious we should have a better conscious affection and things like that and Imagination but what if you took that what if you took that and said okay my memory comes okay I realize I did that but the real me didn't do that the real me the real one inside of me never sinned when that New Birth when he lit my soul with the new birth that clean my slate now we're just trying to get this guy that's why that we we don't smoke drink cuss run around you know do all those things because what's inside of us is now taking over this that's right cuz like I said this is the same person you saw 15 years ago that that did vile things but God started changing from the inside out that's right what the problem is in the in the other ages they never had enough understanding of the word of God a deeper depth of Revelation to believe this is it I'm telling you whole thing in a nutshell I'm talking about Paul irenius Martin all those they prophesied they look toward something but they knew there was a group that was coming and that was their problem they couldn't believe enough of the word of God because they didn't understand the word of God enough cuz it says to whip are to understand the Redemption of the body they never got to there was only a few people brother random got to that stage of the understanding but he didn't make the change because it wasn't for his time it was for you and I the way I see the whole thing the natural types spiritual said the whole thing is a growth experience from the the church church back there was aorn baby at so they got baby F they were babbling babies and each age came y but it's time to eat strong meat though it's time to understand it's time to be justified truly and say God you're the one that did this I know I did wrong things in my life I know I did horrible things in my life but God I know that you didn't count it to me and if I hadn't to come the way I come through my mom and daddy i' never never done that cuz the real me never did it that's where you got to realize those two we actually let me tell you something in our mind right now we're two people that's right right come on let's realize that everybody on the internet too we we are two people that's right and that's the what that's the fight we're two people we got a human side and we got a spiritual side we still lean to this thing rather than to this one that's right because we think this one is more real than this one cuz we can look at it and touch it and feel it right right is that the truth now we got to realize brother D's fixing to get on to it now that's right this is more real than this right have and when we realize that guess what this is going to take over this and we got to realize we're not two people that's right we're one person the theophany of God before the foundation of the world that's what we were we were the theophany of God and now he separated himself out just like we talking about you know with children he's got his children out here now like I said Sunday I believe the 144,000 are already here I believe the two prophets are here I believe the people's ready to take a change of the bodies here and there's really no other person you need to look for right Jesus Christ is already here the judge is already come right what did Brother Brown say he said we get our judgment here what was he telling us right you don't judge a soul that's born again it's already been judged this is what we're judging in 1963 when that judge came down he brought the what the seals for the Judgment of this thing right here the Bible the the Paul irus all those prophets they judged our soul with the word of God but nobody ever was here to judge the body but Jesus Christ had to come he's the only one that can judge the body remember he's the only one that can can judge the body while we're alive down here I'm not talking about when we go on cuz remember when people go on and come back they're already judged what they go through they didn't go through anything different we just got to realize that our our two Natures that we're fighting one day's got to come together that's right and we got to quit fighting ourselves cuz really that's what you're doing CU if the devil's just something on the side of the road that just affects you and that's all he done he he affected people he had no power remember all this was given to him power was given power was given so take that wig in you whatever it's word try to use it we are not two people we are not because if we are two people one of them is Antichrist say that again again that's why we have problems with ourselves say that again if we are two people one of them is Christ and one's the Antichrist remember that's why we're anti against the word of God that's why we got to become one point
