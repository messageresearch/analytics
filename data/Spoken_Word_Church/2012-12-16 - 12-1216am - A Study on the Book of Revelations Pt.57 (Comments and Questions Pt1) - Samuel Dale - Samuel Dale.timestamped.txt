[0:02] amen
[0:03] i don't want to see him don't you good
[0:04] to see everybody in the house of the
[0:06] lord
[0:06] amen he'd like to turn in your
[0:07] scriptures turn where we've been reading
[0:09] in revelation
[0:11] 1 and then we'll read from revelation
[0:14] 6. now remember the announcements that
[0:18] we'll be making
[0:20] and keep on making remember the watch
[0:21] night service will be
[0:23] um on the 31st
[0:26] and on the 30th which is the sunday uh
[0:29] brother
[0:30] jackson will be here preaching for us
[0:32] for on the sunday services
[0:34] and on the monday what's night survey so
[0:38] remember that
[0:39] and i'll be much in prayer for that a
[0:42] sister that goes to brother
[0:44] richard wilson's church their sister
[0:47] kenny i think is the way to pronounce it
[0:49] but her son was attacked last night
[0:52] somewhere
[0:53] and stabbed multiple times and he's in
[0:56] real bad shape
[0:57] so they wanted us to pray for him they
[0:59] were two boys actually that were
[1:01] attacked and her son was the worst one
[1:05] out of the two
[1:06] but let's just pray this morning that
[1:08] the lord wouldn't touch him they already
[1:09] had to give him
[1:10] i forgot how many but it was many many
[1:13] many
[1:13] units of blood and he's already died
[1:16] about three times
[1:18] because of the loss of the blood and the
[1:20] different things so
[1:21] just you know just pray for the boy that
[1:24] he'd
[1:24] come to it and be all right remember
[1:26] wade is over preaching
[1:27] with the pageant today and remember them
[1:30] and any other announcements i generally
[1:32] forget
[1:34] but to what's not service remember that
[1:36] now a few sisters want to
[1:38] fix a few things to bring it would be
[1:40] nice to worry that we could have
[1:42] something to eat after we get through
[1:43] with the what's not service
[1:45] then we wouldn't have to go nobody
[1:47] hadn't have to go eat or anything
[1:49] and the way we generally do is we get
[1:51] here at eight o'clock well
[1:53] we generally get here early enough if
[1:54] you want to come in and eat a little bit
[1:56] before you
[1:57] come upstairs you know you can do that
[1:59] too so we try to
[2:00] do that we do a lot of eating around
[2:02] here and it
[2:04] pretty well tails on all of us
[2:08] who remember that amen so the scriptures
[2:10] revelations 1
[2:11] and revelation 6. heavenly father we
[2:14] thank you
[2:15] lord for this day and your love unto us
[2:18] thank you for calvary thank you for all
[2:20] things
[2:21] we know that you give them to us freely
[2:24] we don't have to even
[2:26] ask for them in the basis that you know
[2:28] what we have need of before we even ask
[2:30] but yet you told us to ask and we shall
[2:32] receive so then that makes a double part
[2:35] of it to word that we can ask you and
[2:36] depend upon it
[2:38] the lord jesus would just be with the
[2:40] family there
[2:41] of this one the boy that was stabbed
[2:43] that they're trying to take care of him
[2:45] for the two boys lord and just be with
[2:48] the boy and bring him out of this
[2:50] and lord make everything to be all right
[2:53] we know that we've prayed and we
[2:55] we believe you and be with the families
[2:57] there of the of the children that were
[2:59] all killed our
[3:01] lord and just bless them and
[3:04] the different ones that was killed we
[3:07] know the prophet said it was insanity
[3:10] would be in the streets and we see it
[3:13] lord
[3:13] that's don't ever hand these things are
[3:16] taking place
[3:17] but we know and realize true that we
[3:19] believe that you said you'd take care of
[3:21] us
[3:22] so we believe you we depend upon that
[3:23] have your way now as we read your word
[3:26] you come and speak to our hearts and
[3:27] direct us in what to say to your people
[3:30] in jesus name amen
[3:34] revelations one
[3:38] told the brothers that give them a
[3:39] vacation today they don't have any
[3:41] quotes to run
[3:42] so we'll be on comments and questions so
[3:46] you know they can kind of take a little
[3:47] relaxing time
[3:50] it says the revelation of jesus christ
[3:52] which god gave unto him
[3:54] showing to his servants things which
[3:56] must shortly come to pass
[3:58] and he said and signified it by his
[4:00] angel and to his servant john
[4:02] to by record of the word of god and the
[4:04] testimony of jesus christ and of all
[4:06] things that he saw
[4:08] blessed is he that readeth and they hear
[4:10] the words of this prophecy
[4:11] and keep those things which are written
[4:13] there in where the time
[4:15] is at hand all right we'll go over so
[4:18] we'll be dealing with
[4:19] the seals and questions and comments so
[4:22] we will just read the sixth seal
[4:26] verse 12 of the sixth chapter
[4:30] and when he had opened the sixth seal
[4:32] and lo there was a great earthquake
[4:34] the sun became black a sackcloth of
[4:36] power and the moon became his blood
[4:38] and the stars of heaven fell unto the
[4:41] earth even as a fig tree canceled her
[4:43] untimely figs
[4:45] when she is shaken of a mighty wind and
[4:47] the heaven departed as a scroll when it
[4:50] when it is rolled together and every
[4:52] mountain and island
[4:53] were moved out of their places the kings
[4:55] of the earth and the great men and the
[4:57] rich men and the chief captains and the
[4:59] mighty men and every bondman than ever
[5:01] freeman
[5:02] hid themselves in the dens and the rocks
[5:05] of the
[5:06] mountains and said to the mountains and
[5:08] rocks fall on us and hide us from
[5:10] the face of him that setteth on the
[5:12] throne
[5:13] and from the wrath of god for the great
[5:15] day of his wrath is come
[5:17] and who shall be able to stand
[5:20] he may be seated over that is blessing
[5:23] the
[5:24] reading of the word now we were going to
[5:27] have
[5:28] questions and answers
[5:31] wednesday but the old long-winded
[5:33] preacher got too much
[5:35] involved and we didn't get housing so we
[5:38] moved it over to
[5:39] this morning and so then if you have any
[5:43] questions comments and things um
[5:47] you know about what we've been speaking
[5:49] on
[5:50] in this study of the book of revelations
[5:53] then you know
[5:54] if you would when we get around to it
[5:56] we'll uh give you an opportunity to
[5:58] comment article
[5:59] to ask the question about the things
[6:03] now we've come up through the seals
[6:09] and we've we've come to the bases now
[6:11] talking and trying to finish up
[6:13] on this sixth seal but we've been
[6:16] talking about what did the seals reveal
[6:19] the plan of redemption
[6:23] all right now it was the things that
[6:26] mankind
[6:29] even though it was done at calvary
[6:32] even though jesus christ came and paid
[6:34] the price
[6:36] we realized still that at this time
[6:39] we are still in these mortal bodies you
[6:42] know
[6:43] death doomed mortal bodies and and in
[6:46] doing that then
[6:48] something is not finished about the plan
[6:51] of salvation
[6:53] but i believe this is the end time i
[6:56] believe this is the time that it's to be
[6:58] made known
[6:59] even as romans 8 says that
[7:02] all of us are waiting and everybody is
[7:04] waiting on who
[7:06] the sons and daughters of god to come to
[7:08] the position
[7:10] to work that god can be among us as we
[7:13] were talking about wednesday
[7:15] and change these old bodies that we live
[7:17] in
[7:18] and take us in a rapture all right and
[7:21] it says darren roman said we're waiting
[7:23] to wit
[7:25] to understand to to come to a position
[7:28] of knowing about the plan of redemption
[7:34] and you know we look back and we say
[7:37] well it was paid for by jesus what do we
[7:39] need to know
[7:40] well we've been running now for 2000
[7:43] years
[7:44] i can't believe we need to know
[7:45] something that's right if not we might
[7:47] be around here two more thousand
[7:49] years you know because it's not a bus
[7:53] pulling up for a time you know where
[7:56] obama as a president or whatever you
[8:00] want to do and i'm not against any of
[8:01] that
[8:02] i don't vote i don't say for you not to
[8:05] i just say i don't vote
[8:07] last time i voted i voted for john f
[8:09] kennedy and i found out we put a
[8:11] catholic in the white house and
[8:13] we found out from the prophet's message
[8:15] that's what we come over here in america
[8:16] to get away from
[8:17] and we brought him over here as our
[8:19] president but
[8:20] i i have nothing against any of them who
[8:22] you put in the office it wouldn't matter
[8:24] i told you about the doings you know and
[8:26] i don't argue with nobody about
[8:28] politics because what need is it
[8:34] my bible says i put in kings and i take
[8:37] out kings amen
[8:38] that's right so ever who's supposed to
[8:40] be in the office
[8:42] is in the office all right so
[8:45] everything's right with god you know so
[8:47] you'd say well the world's coming to an
[8:49] end in a few days because
[8:51] 21st of this month is supposed to be the
[8:54] end of the world according to the mayan
[8:55] calendar
[8:57] you know and everything's supposed to
[8:58] end right there
[9:00] well i don't think so because
[9:03] we are not in a rapture yet we're still
[9:06] here and even if you did they would
[9:09] still be if we left right now
[9:11] they would still be three and a half
[9:12] years of earthly time
[9:14] called the tribulation so who's worried
[9:17] about the mayan calendar
[9:19] i'm not concerned about that i'm
[9:21] concerned about mine in your calendar
[9:24] you know what i mean by that i'm
[9:25] concerned about our salvation
[9:28] all right because we need to know the
[9:30] plan of rejection
[9:32] all right now and in doing that then we
[9:35] found
[9:36] some marvelous things in the taking and
[9:39] not
[9:39] dealing so much with the seals and
[9:41] things but just taking them and looking
[9:43] at them and
[9:44] and then seeing what applies to our
[9:46] sales
[9:48] and studying it from that and asking you
[9:50] to do that on each one
[9:52] and you'll see more this afternoon while
[9:55] we've been saying that that
[9:57] i've been wanting you to study the seals
[10:00] read of yourself
[10:01] but what about what do i try to
[10:03] encourage you to do read them to see
[10:05] what is talking to you
[10:08] we know the symbols we know
[10:11] the writings we we've had that
[10:13] interpreted unto us
[10:15] all right but yet what does it mean to
[10:17] you and i
[10:20] the prophet said it one day like this he
[10:22] said god opened one of those seals and
[10:24] john saw his name
[10:26] well have we he said have we seen our
[10:28] name
[10:30] through the opening of the seals yes
[10:32] that's right and we found our name in
[10:33] the book
[10:35] not samuel dale but what's going on
[10:38] during the time that that name is on the
[10:41] earth
[10:41] all right now so then we found out that
[10:45] these things it comes down to the ages
[10:47] we saw the seals as they open
[10:49] we've seen how that they revealed a
[10:51] white horse rider red horse rider
[10:53] black horse rider you know and pale
[10:56] horse rider
[10:58] then we come up to the fifth seal and we
[11:01] found that there's no symbols there
[11:04] that's very important i hope you'll
[11:06] remember that i
[11:07] asked you to write that down about what
[11:10] three or four months ago i guess
[11:12] but anyhow i said it'd be very valuable
[11:16] one day
[11:19] because there's no symbols under the
[11:21] fifth seal
[11:23] it tells you what it is it's sold under
[11:26] the altar as people
[11:28] now we needed to know who those people
[11:30] were yeah
[11:32] but it's not a symbol it had to be broke
[11:37] it was right there in the letter of the
[11:38] word
[11:40] that paul on that fifth seal talking
[11:42] about it you know not
[11:43] knowing he he didn't call it seals but
[11:46] he said
[11:47] all israel will be saved so we went
[11:50] through that seeing not ever israelite
[11:53] but all the predestinated would be saved
[11:57] all right that's not a symbol that's a
[12:00] statement of a fact about people
[12:02] then we went on into the sixth seal and
[12:05] talking about the
[12:06] great things that we just read here of
[12:09] the great tribulation
[12:11] that would come upon the earth you know
[12:14] all right
[12:15] and then we went through the point of
[12:18] how that revelation 7
[12:21] was the showing of the 144 000
[12:24] that would be sealed in the tribulation
[12:28] period
[12:30] but would have to be put there because
[12:31] they rejected the messiah
[12:34] you know israel rejected jesus christ
[12:37] thereby they must be purged and even
[12:40] though those
[12:41] those hundred forty four thousand the
[12:43] two witnesses know even though they
[12:45] receive eternal life here
[12:48] by the rejecting of the messiah
[12:52] they still have to be purged all right
[12:54] so they're put right in that tribulation
[12:56] period
[12:57] for the purging you know because
[13:01] everything that's not purged must
[13:03] eventually be purged
[13:05] somewhere even this world one day
[13:09] at armageddon right it will be a purging
[13:13] of the world all right that's not when
[13:16] it goes on over to the future home now
[13:18] but it is a purging of the world
[13:21] getting ready for the millennial reign
[13:23] can you get out of the millennium like
[13:25] this
[13:26] i hope we don't believe like some people
[13:28] believe that the year we are today
[13:30] and we're going along you know and
[13:33] mad because we got to go to work
[13:35] tomorrow and don't like our bosses but
[13:38] something just happens click and there's
[13:40] a doctrine of this
[13:42] you know and they just click and all at
[13:44] once we just all go to work tomorrow and
[13:46] happy
[13:48] well i don't think that's exactly right
[13:52] i miss the whole plan of redemption
[13:53] myself if that's what it is
[13:56] but see we believe that there must be a
[13:59] purging
[14:00] all right and israel must be purged for
[14:03] her rejecting of the messiah
[14:05] that's right so she's put in the
[14:08] tribulation period for that
[14:10] the foolish virgins must be purged
[14:13] because of their rejecting of the true
[14:16] god
[14:17] or the truth right now see then it's not
[14:21] god's fault because
[14:22] there will be a great multitude of of
[14:26] gentiles as we call them which means
[14:28] nations
[14:30] will be in the tribulation because of
[14:33] their rejecting
[14:35] of the truth see people who say well i
[14:37] never rejected the truth
[14:39] but what about the truth
[14:45] where can you go preach the truth too
[14:50] you know so you can see there's going to
[14:52] be a vast majority of people
[14:54] in the end times going to wind up being
[14:55] foolish virgins because you can't preach
[14:57] the truth
[14:58] to them well then just bring it on up in
[15:00] this message and see then you can see
[15:02] you can't preach the truth to the people
[15:04] of this message
[15:07] because even some of you still have your
[15:09] own comments
[15:11] irregardless of what's proved or said
[15:14] from the word
[15:15] you'll hold your own thoughts well
[15:17] someday that's
[15:18] if that's true your thoughts are true
[15:20] it'll be all right but if not that's
[15:22] going to be purged
[15:24] now the bride does not have to go to the
[15:26] tribulation right
[15:28] so their purging is going to be here
[15:30] that's right amen
[15:32] by the new birth we're purging our soul
[15:35] by the washing of the water of the word
[15:38] the revealing of god's word
[15:40] then you and i are washed here
[15:43] it's not a purgatory we go to
[15:47] but it's a purging of ourselves
[15:51] right a repentance paul said i die daily
[15:57] now was that a tribulation no
[16:01] but it was a purging that's right they
[16:03] said
[16:04] we don't have to go through the
[16:05] tribulation because we're the bride of
[16:06] crops
[16:07] those who receive the new birth as the
[16:10] gentile dispensation don't have to go
[16:11] through the tribulation
[16:14] but those who don't receive it will have
[16:16] to go to that point all right
[16:18] we see even the world has to be purged
[16:21] before it can go into the millennial
[16:22] reign
[16:24] satan will have to be bound
[16:28] there all right by chain of
[16:30] circumstances
[16:33] not a log chain think satan can be
[16:36] changed
[16:38] by some lock and key you know
[16:42] he doesn't have anybody to work through
[16:44] the prophet said that's the best
[16:45] definition you can get
[16:47] see he's chained he's put into a
[16:51] bottomless pit and chain
[16:52] don't have nobody to work through in
[16:54] other words people won't listen to him
[16:55] no more
[16:56] that's right he's done been proven to be
[16:58] who he is and they won't listen
[17:01] we see that brings the purging of
[17:03] everything that we found on the sixth
[17:05] seal
[17:06] because that sixth seal deals with the
[17:08] tribulation period
[17:11] all right
[17:14] see it starts off by an earthquake it
[17:16] starts off by the great things
[17:18] happening you know and then it comes
[17:21] down to the
[17:22] end of the world and that was the three
[17:25] questions in matthew 24 that they asked
[17:26] jesus
[17:28] you know when will it be there won't be
[17:29] one stone you know won't be one stone
[17:31] left on another
[17:32] he then brought around said that was
[17:33] titus in 80 70.
[17:35] well that's you know all right
[17:38] then said what will be the sound of thy
[17:41] coming
[17:43] well the coming of the lord is right now
[17:45] among the people where there are
[17:47] you know whether whatever church you'd
[17:48] be in who you still have to believe this
[17:50] is coming now
[17:52] all right and then the end of the world
[17:54] we see the sixth seal is the end of the
[17:56] known world
[17:57] not destruction of the world because it
[17:59] never will be destroyed
[18:02] right it never will be totally
[18:04] annihilated out of existence
[18:06] it will be purged amen and getting ready
[18:09] to word that god can live on the earth
[18:12] and fulfill the promise to david
[18:16] of sitting on the throne in the
[18:17] millennial reign all right
[18:19] and in doing that then we see that the
[18:22] sixth seal will be
[18:24] the end of the world as we call it
[18:31] the next after the end of the world sea
[18:33] would wind up to be
[18:35] uh the millennial reign
[18:38] the millennial reign then is where the
[18:40] scripture says that the first heavens
[18:42] and the first earth
[18:43] is passed away all right the first
[18:47] earth is now the first heaven is a
[18:50] millennial reign
[18:52] so one day that will pass away and when
[18:55] it does
[18:56] it will be going into a total utopia of
[19:00] eternity when the future home comes into
[19:03] existence but
[19:04] we're trying to just stay with what's
[19:06] revealed in the seals
[19:08] but see the complete plan of redemption
[19:10] is revealed
[19:11] in those six seals the seventh seal
[19:14] don't reveal nothing
[19:16] it just says silence in heaven let's
[19:19] place a half hour
[19:21] now it can be revealed
[19:25] because the prophet said i'll tell you
[19:26] my revelation
[19:30] but now what is that we'll get to those
[19:32] things this afternoon the lord willing
[19:33] and start
[19:34] on to that point and maybe we'll make it
[19:37] by the millennial running
[19:41] but see all names then we covered and
[19:45] there's a question on this and i'm just
[19:46] getting this part
[19:48] all names then are revealed
[19:52] on the sixth seal because it shows the
[19:55] completed plan of redemption
[19:58] and all names are revealed that will
[20:00] ever be upon this earth
[20:02] by the time the tribulation period hits
[20:05] all that will
[20:06] ever be saved or anything
[20:09] if we're going to believe the the
[20:11] tribulation to be you know the
[20:12] the great earthquakes and the things
[20:14] happen would be the end of the known
[20:16] world
[20:17] then there won't be a place somewhere
[20:19] else that names will be
[20:21] present so it's all revealed here
[20:27] even though the feel sealed jew is sold
[20:30] under the altar
[20:31] still they're killed from calvary down
[20:33] to where we are that's right
[20:35] all right so all names is revealed on
[20:37] that
[20:38] and the white throne judgment when it
[20:40] comes it won't be
[20:42] a revealing of names it it'll be a
[20:45] destruction of people
[20:49] in a giving of eternal life to the
[20:50] foolish virgins
[20:53] right who stood for the word the best
[20:54] they could all right
[20:57] now
[21:01] then in doing that
[21:04] we want to take the point and we have
[21:07] that
[21:08] see you and i have to be purged
[21:11] as i said a moment ago well bless god i
[21:14] don't
[21:15] see him shut up you're lying
[21:18] you're about like jack cole said when
[21:20] that lady came up there and said
[21:22] brother cole i want to lay my tongue on
[21:24] the altar
[21:26] he said i just gossip all the time and i
[21:29] want to put my tongue on the altar
[21:31] he said ma'am this time this pulpit and
[21:34] alder's only 15 foot said there ain't
[21:37] enough
[21:37] room for your tongue
[21:42] that's pretty strong man but it's true
[21:45] that's right right that's right but you
[21:48] see a bride has to be so
[21:49] purged not going through the tribulation
[21:52] to be purged
[21:56] but the revealing of god's word
[22:00] is what purges us that's right
[22:03] brother brown would say one day like
[22:05] this he said talking i think of
[22:06] revelations 5 i'm not certain
[22:09] but he said that makes you like it said
[22:11] you could just
[22:12] you could crawl under a concrete block
[22:16] with a 10 gallon hat on now that's how
[22:20] little it makes you feel
[22:23] if you get a revelation and it blows
[22:25] your head up
[22:27] i'll tell you up front that's not god's
[22:29] word being wrinkled to you
[22:34] you see these people that couldn't walk
[22:35] in this building because their heads are
[22:37] big and
[22:38] if it rained while they outside they
[22:40] drowned because there were no stuck up
[22:41] in the air and i'm talking about the
[22:42] preacher in this message
[22:45] you know real quick there's something
[22:46] wrong
[22:49] but random they said was the most humble
[22:50] man you've ever seen
[22:52] the lord jesus was the most humble man
[22:57] see a revelation never never builds you
[23:00] up a revolution will take you down
[23:04] i've never had one yet come to me that
[23:06] it didn't humble me
[23:08] because of thinking lord
[23:12] you would reveal that to me
[23:16] when the world is full of good people
[23:19] and yet you would reveal yourself to me
[23:24] if it don't humble us it's not a
[23:26] revelation
[23:28] it's an exalted extent of our own sales
[23:31] now watch what i'm saying
[23:35] those hundred forty four thousand
[23:42] i'm getting ready now for the question
[23:44] so anybody got any writing down get
[23:46] ready
[23:47] 144 thousand the feel sealed jews the
[23:52] the uh foolish virgins
[23:58] they're actually purged
[24:02] by the word
[24:05] made manifest i hope you think that over
[24:11] that sixth seal we just read is god's
[24:14] word you agree
[24:15] yes i mean we just read it out of the
[24:16] book right
[24:18] we just read it we just read what would
[24:20] take place
[24:22] that there'd be these earthquakes and
[24:24] they'd be all kind of drastic things you
[24:26] know would take place upon the earth
[24:29] and a great purging time
[24:33] see then they're actually purged by the
[24:36] word
[24:38] that's made manifest
[24:41] or into reality right
[24:44] now we don't have to go to the
[24:47] tribulation
[24:50] right right so we must be pursed by
[24:53] the word that is revealed to you and us
[25:00] see when it's revealed it'll be made
[25:01] manifest right
[25:04] but i hope you understand the difference
[25:05] and we'll get into the question
[25:07] see like 144 000 of people like that
[25:12] that word that's made manifest or that
[25:14] seal that breaks
[25:16] is the word of god made manifest on
[25:18] earth
[25:20] a purging of the world and all kinds of
[25:21] things see that's an example to you and
[25:24] i
[25:25] that the word that is revealed to you
[25:27] and i
[25:29] is what's going to purge us
[25:34] this bride is going to be so purged
[25:37] until she could take a change until she
[25:40] can do it we were talking about
[25:41] wednesday and sunday and
[25:42] all surprised until the world is waiting
[25:46] on you and i to reach that position
[25:49] everybody
[25:53] in the line of redemption is waiting on
[26:01] you better read revelation i mean uh
[26:03] hebrews 11
[26:06] because it's dealing with old testament
[26:08] science
[26:10] and then it's dealing with people down
[26:13] through time
[26:14] right right that comes into
[26:17] gentile new birth and dispensation
[26:21] they're waiting on you and i to reach a
[26:25] place
[26:26] to where they can be returned back
[26:30] to mortal bodies
[26:34] to reality they're dependent on you and
[26:37] i
[26:39] that's right see then we must by the
[26:42] revealed word as i said a moment ago
[26:44] if that word when it's revealed to you
[26:46] don't take you down don't make you weep
[26:48] and you just want to walk away
[26:52] i've said many things from this pulpit
[26:54] that you think i'm crazy
[26:56] i preached here a mini a sermon that i
[26:58] could go sit down in that seat and
[27:00] wonder who preached
[27:05] actually wonder who's doing the
[27:07] preaching
[27:11] i've had it hit me so much until i
[27:14] literally wanted to walk out the door
[27:17] and just walk home
[27:24] that's what a revelation will do too
[27:27] it won't blow you up me my mind might
[27:29] look at me
[27:32] you gotta come to me and get it no
[27:37] you see that happening you need to get
[27:39] away from people
[27:42] you need to get to the reveal word
[27:45] they are repeat are purged by
[27:48] manifestation
[27:50] we are verbs by revelation
[27:54] god revealing his word to you and i
[27:57] all right now let's get into the
[28:00] questions
[28:01] and i said you write down what you're
[28:03] thinking on
[28:05] and then we'll try to get to that and if
[28:07] we have to we'll take this afternoon
[28:09] whatever we have to take
[28:11] it don't make no difference to me i gave
[28:14] the
[28:14] brothers the quotes for this afternoon
[28:17] where they would
[28:17] you know they could be ready and
[28:21] everything else but we don't have to
[28:22] take them we take them next week
[28:25] or next year don't matter to me
[28:29] but here's some i got some questions i
[28:31] just want to
[28:32] cover and then you you think about it
[28:34] and maybe you're thinking on these
[28:36] questions or whatever you have on your
[28:37] heart
[28:38] write it down and then we'll give you an
[28:40] opportunity
[28:43] he said brother dale said revelation 6
[28:45] 12.
[28:47] and that's where we read now about how
[28:50] that
[28:50] behold when he had opened the sixth seal
[28:53] and lo there was a
[28:54] great earthquake and in the great things
[28:57] it started
[28:58] happening under that
[29:01] says what do you see happening in here
[29:06] and is this the future or has some of
[29:09] these things happening
[29:11] right now as far as the sixth seal part
[29:17] the opening and the great earthquake and
[29:20] the great
[29:21] problems
[29:24] the way i see it is that that'll happen
[29:26] one day
[29:28] that's in the future because that'll be
[29:30] you know to the
[29:32] world and the things when we get out of
[29:34] here but yet we lead up to it
[29:40] the prophet of god you're talking about
[29:42] we'll get to it in a second
[29:43] he said after a series of earthquakes
[29:47] and look at them around the world today
[29:51] probably a thousand a day almost
[29:53] somewhere around the world you know
[29:54] if you calculated every little tremor of
[29:56] a little movement
[29:59] and look the great ones we've seen with
[30:01] 300 000 or something people just
[30:04] earthquakes out in the ocean you know
[30:06] sometimes
[30:08] you see that's not the sixth seal
[30:13] that's a preacher revelation
[30:17] because you and i can be right now and
[30:19] we are we're in a preach revelation
[30:22] hitler and eichmann and all of them
[30:23] killing all those jews
[30:25] the prophet would call it a
[30:26] pre-tribulation which means before
[30:29] the tribulation the great tribulation
[30:33] will
[30:33] open with a great earthquake
[30:36] all right so then the things leading up
[30:39] to it we see
[30:42] but to read the seal itself he said
[30:45] behold when he had
[30:46] opened the sixth seal and lo there was a
[30:48] great earthquake
[30:50] all right now when that seal opens there
[30:53] will
[30:54] be a a great earthquake take place
[30:58] all right amen because the bible says it
[31:00] will
[31:01] all right now all right
[31:07] see now here's another part of it
[31:11] so are there two quakes los angeles
[31:15] an amount of olives you know we're
[31:17] talking about
[31:18] los angeles going under one day prophet
[31:21] said it would and we believe it
[31:23] science says we don't know when but it
[31:26] will
[31:27] i mean that's their statement it will
[31:29] one day but it can't stand what it's
[31:31] doing
[31:32] and uh then the two earthquakes los
[31:36] angeles
[31:37] and when the mount of olives cleaved and
[31:39] the mountain pushes up you remember
[31:41] they're over in the
[31:44] time after we get out of here all right
[31:47] now are they the same
[31:51] the person was asking now
[31:54] i don't believe it's the same because i
[31:58] believe that there'll be a great
[31:59] earthquake
[32:00] and los angeles can go under
[32:05] and that's not the opening of the sixth
[32:07] seal
[32:10] see that's what we've always taught and
[32:12] thought about right
[32:14] but i've never taught it that way
[32:16] because there's so many earthquakes to
[32:17] deal with
[32:18] in doings until you can't just lay it
[32:22] down and this was it
[32:24] you don't find brother random saying the
[32:26] sixth seal opens with an earthquake in
[32:28] california goes under
[32:29] you know he doesn't stipulate those
[32:34] points
[32:35] he just makes the point that one day
[32:37] there will be a great earthquake in
[32:38] california would go under
[32:41] well see there was an earthquake when
[32:42] jesus raised
[32:44] there could be an earthquake when the
[32:46] resurrection takes place
[32:50] in california could be that earthquake
[32:51] see that's what what i've tried to tell
[32:53] people
[32:54] to try to warn people 98 of the people
[32:57] of this message
[32:59] believe that california went under right
[33:01] now and we're standing here
[33:02] we're in the tribulation come on
[33:10] you gotta ask them
[33:14] he said well we're going into we're
[33:15] gonna be out of here california goes
[33:17] under
[33:18] we'll show me where brother ryan said
[33:20] that
[33:23] that's got to be your idea
[33:27] yeah but it's going to be a faster well
[33:29] sure are these vast earthquakes right
[33:30] now
[33:34] i mean 300 000 people over there that
[33:36] likes one that was an earthquake
[33:38] out in the middle of the ocean and then
[33:39] the tidal wave went in
[33:41] one of that thing that kept ripping open
[33:47] you see church that's why i've always
[33:49] tried ahead of time
[33:50] to tell you where you wouldn't be so
[33:53] shook up is a word we use and i'm sorry
[33:56] for that language
[33:57] out there on the internet system some
[33:59] people hear that wonder what shook up
[34:01] mean
[34:01] no we're all nervous oh down and out
[34:05] scared to death you know
[34:09] because i stood many years ago told you
[34:11] we could pass 1977.
[34:16] and we're practicing
[34:20] the year 2000 rolled around and said
[34:25] bring your flashlight will you we're
[34:26] going to have a what's not church
[34:30] in case you're afraid fill up your tank
[34:32] before you come
[34:35] unless you're scared
[34:39] i've always tried to tell you ahead of
[34:40] time
[34:42] see if we're sitting here right now and
[34:44] i know it'd be a drastic
[34:45] happening worldwide because of the way
[34:47] the prophet would say things were
[34:49] happening
[34:51] the tidal wave reached our way to
[34:52] kentucky
[34:55] all right he said well nothing couldn't
[34:57] survive that evidently it does
[35:00] but that could happen and you and i
[35:02] still here
[35:06] because that's not
[35:09] if california went under
[35:12] right now i
[35:16] always thought that after the
[35:17] resurrection that we'd be here 30 40
[35:20] days
[35:20] that was my understanding but then you'd
[35:24] be
[35:24] if you took the earthquake in california
[35:26] to be the opening of the sixth seal
[35:28] then you put the bride in the
[35:29] tribulation for 30 40 days
[35:32] see people don't even think
[35:36] the only thing sensible you see some
[35:39] great revelation and everybody said oh
[35:42] in california go to but what if it goes
[35:44] under
[35:46] then you're still here
[35:53] come on
[35:56] see i just try to tell it as straight as
[35:59] i know
[36:00] i know i get in trouble you become a
[36:03] sarcastic arrogant old dude it's
[36:06] intellectual
[36:10] but we're still here where was you at
[36:13] when 77 rolled around
[36:17] and i said we could be here longer than
[36:19] that
[36:22] oh that just makes you exalted no it
[36:24] don't make me exalted
[36:26] it makes me very horrible
[36:30] that i could stand in 74 and say we
[36:33] could pass the year 2026
[36:36] and i say now the year of 2000 or 50
[36:39] your 5 000
[36:40] would make no difference because of the
[36:43] way you entered the jubilees
[36:47] you see everybody else was sending their
[36:49] books back
[36:51] scared to death
[36:55] i wanted it to come yeah
[36:59] i want the resurrection to come before
[37:00] california goes under
[37:03] you know i want the dead to raise and
[37:05] let's get out of here before california
[37:07] goes under
[37:08] because i don't want to be here with all
[37:10] that horrible things that place
[37:16] but i'm just saying it could be
[37:20] see then the earthquake to california
[37:22] would not be connected with the
[37:23] earthquake over when it spits
[37:25] the mount of olives because according to
[37:27] the bible
[37:29] when that happens he'll stand with one
[37:31] foot
[37:32] on land one on sea or whatever it is or
[37:34] the scripture and it'll cleave
[37:38] not a great big jesus standing there
[37:41] right but pushing up getting ready for
[37:45] the millennium
[37:48] and getting the purgings and the things
[37:50] that are set forth
[37:52] doing so is it the same one no i don't
[37:54] think so
[37:58] i believe there's a difference in it
[38:02] i believe the tribulation period begins
[38:04] according to reading of the bible
[38:06] with the opening of the great earthquake
[38:11] i know the quotes so don't run too far
[38:13] they brought around said they can open
[38:15] that earth
[38:15] that seal anytime they want to
[38:19] it's true
[38:23] that's true but has you ever thought
[38:26] about
[38:26] that
[38:30] it doesn't mean brethren said
[38:33] tribulation sets in here works its way
[38:36] to israel while they're getting their
[38:37] message
[38:40] you got to do with the breaking of a
[38:43] seal before you can have the revealing
[38:44] of the seal
[38:46] before they can open that seal it's got
[38:48] to be revealed to them
[38:53] simple language simple points but think
[38:56] about it
[39:00] there'll be many many earthquakes
[39:05] because they're all around the world
[39:06] today
[39:09] see that's why we don't look to
[39:12] earthquakes
[39:15] brother dale if i'm around here out of
[39:17] that earthquake california i'm gonna
[39:19] know i missed it
[39:20] i'm not gonna say i need it amen
[39:25] i'm gonna say god's word has been made
[39:28] manifest
[39:34] you believe god's word will be made
[39:36] manifest when it goes under
[39:38] because that's what the prophet said it
[39:39] was going to do that'll be the word of
[39:40] god make matter
[39:43] we don't have to deal with tribulations
[39:48] but then there will be one earthquake
[39:50] that will be dealing with tribulation
[39:53] what's always been amazing to me is if
[39:56] you'll notice when that earthquake takes
[39:58] place or that
[39:59] opening when you get on over into the
[40:02] scriptures and picking them up and
[40:03] putting them back with this sixth seal
[40:05] you'll find that the thirteenth chapter
[40:07] i believe it is it
[40:09] no two witnesses you know
[40:14] the great things will be taking place in
[40:15] their ministry
[40:19] great earthquakes can be happening
[40:22] everywhere
[40:25] i'm reading the thing brother aaron
[40:27] brought me the other day about
[40:29] the things and see right now all you
[40:30] have to have is a change of the polar
[40:32] axis
[40:33] of the earth and you say that can't
[40:35] happen
[40:37] they can prove about 400 000 years ago
[40:40] it did take place
[40:42] but now brother dale we've only been
[40:44] here 6 000 years
[40:48] you better read your prophet's message
[40:52] said when it says in the beginning god
[40:53] created heaven and earth
[40:55] as a period there he said that could
[40:57] have been millions of millions of years
[41:00] before he started dealing with to bring
[41:03] it into use
[41:06] so they can take their carbon content
[41:08] and prove certain things
[41:11] but you better study on your carbon
[41:13] content because there's a lot of things
[41:15] they won't
[41:16] they won't study the human body on
[41:18] certain ways on the carbon content
[41:20] because it gives them the wrong reading
[41:23] you'll read a little bit about the
[41:25] things that they deal with
[41:28] they're coming to find out that a lot of
[41:30] those things that they
[41:31] thought was people that existed millions
[41:35] of years ago
[41:36] to come to find out to be a hoax
[41:41] thing but that's stuck to the world
[41:44] that's not up to me
[41:45] i'm trying to answer questions i don't
[41:47] believe
[41:48] the earthquake in california and los
[41:50] angeles going under
[41:52] and the mount of olives cleveland will
[41:53] be the same earthquake
[41:56] because i believe there'll be many
[41:57] earthquakes i believe the sixth seal
[41:58] will open with an earthquake
[42:00] because we just read it out of the bible
[42:03] great things can be taking place but i
[42:07] believe california can go under right
[42:08] now
[42:09] and you and i can still be around here
[42:10] 30 40 days
[42:13] and don't put us in the tribulation
[42:18] right see one of these days when we get
[42:22] back preaching on the tribulation enough
[42:24] because to me the tribulation is a wrath
[42:25] of god poured out
[42:28] this is not tribulations that are
[42:30] happening now 300 000 people over in
[42:31] that license
[42:33] died you know everyone died back there
[42:35] and big old words just showing these i
[42:37] can't pronounce them
[42:40] great title waves killed 3000 people
[42:43] wasn't a sick seal i think the wrath of
[42:46] god being poured out
[42:49] everybody said oh look at the wrath of
[42:51] god poured out because they were so mean
[42:54] whoa i'd be careful to talk like that
[42:58] we might get a few minor ones and be it
[43:00] ourselves okay
[43:02] now let's go on
[43:05] so that would be then not
[43:08] the same earthquake all right here's
[43:11] another question
[43:14] these things come from what i've
[43:16] preached on the seal tonight
[43:18] it's a question all names revealed under
[43:21] the sixth seal
[43:24] does that mean as we see who is
[43:27] sanctified
[43:29] by the purging seal
[43:32] literally and by the word
[43:36] all names are revealed the prophet said
[43:38] on the sixth seal before the seventh
[43:40] seal
[43:41] opens on this coming we'll get back to
[43:43] those quotes
[43:44] all right as i said a moment ago then
[43:46] all names are revealed
[43:48] why because that is the complete plan of
[43:50] redemption
[43:52] you don't have to go to the white throne
[43:54] the ones that go to the white throne
[43:56] are the people that are on earth here
[43:58] before the millennial reign
[44:01] you understand yes when you go to the
[44:04] white throne it's not
[44:05] not being a a group of people artists
[44:08] you don't have no names for it
[44:10] it'll be that they were already on the
[44:12] earth
[44:13] as people so all names then are revealed
[44:18] in the plan of redemption because it
[44:21] shows who can be redeemed
[44:24] it shows how they'll be repenting it
[44:26] shows
[44:27] even that some people will receive
[44:29] eternal life
[44:30] at the water on judgment but it shows
[44:34] that some will never receive it nowhere
[44:36] and be cast into fire
[44:40] and it'll take part in the second death
[44:42] which
[44:44] the second death is the death of the
[44:46] soul see
[44:47] you can blow my head slap off but you
[44:49] can't kill me
[44:51] only god can kill the soul that's what
[44:53] the bible says said don't fear the man
[44:55] who can destroy the body
[44:57] he said fear the god that can destroy
[45:00] both soul and body
[45:02] because he has that white throne it'll
[45:03] be god saying
[45:05] go you rejected the word
[45:12] if you reject the word you turn down the
[45:14] word then what can you argue with god
[45:16] that's right what can you say to him
[45:20] he said didn't you hear
[45:24] say yes well if you heard it
[45:30] then you have no argument we see all
[45:33] names are revealed said does that mean
[45:35] that
[45:36] as we see who is sanctified by
[45:40] the purging seal literally and by the
[45:42] word see that's
[45:43] that's those people that we see
[45:46] the full plan of redemption is made
[45:48] known by the time of the sixth seal
[45:50] so then you see every name that would
[45:51] ever be revealed or it would be revealed
[45:53] and why they wouldn't be
[45:55] wouldn't be i mean made known or why
[45:58] they wouldn't be saved and why they are
[45:59] saved
[46:00] what is the plan of redemption
[46:04] we don't have a court of appeal the
[46:06] fight whites on judgment
[46:07] is not a court of appeal
[46:10] it ain't going to do you much good to
[46:11] pledge a case
[46:14] right it ain't going to be that it ain't
[46:18] going to be a judging jury
[46:20] right remember
[46:23] the bride sits on the throne with him
[46:27] and remember all that god's got to do is
[46:29] turn back and say
[46:31] you see that person did you reject what
[46:35] they were saying
[46:37] they don't want me no choice see this
[46:41] thing is is
[46:42] it's made to work that you and i should
[46:44] be into the place but now watch
[46:46] all names are revealed because the end
[46:49] of redemption
[46:50] is made known by the time of the sixth
[46:52] seal
[46:53] and even those who go to the white
[46:55] throne judgment their name would have
[46:57] had to be made manifest
[46:59] here on earth during the time of these
[47:01] six seals
[47:03] all right so that's the answer to the
[47:05] question the best i can give
[47:10] see then the sixth seal will be the end
[47:12] of time
[47:15] now once he said no no no no the
[47:18] millennium is a thousand years
[47:20] you know but you went back to 360 days
[47:22] to a month how many years
[47:25] you went back to 30 days to a month
[47:27] millennium so
[47:29] time will have ended as far as we know
[47:31] it
[47:32] of the mortal time that we exist now
[47:36] that will be time yes but not
[47:40] the 365 and a fourth that goes back in
[47:42] the millennium to 360 days to a year
[47:44] 30 days to a month perfect order
[47:48] see so it can be made manifest right now
[47:54] does anybody have any questions right
[47:56] now because
[47:59] i'm trying to relate it to this and i'm
[48:00] not saying that next ones are not
[48:02] related to what we preached on it is
[48:04] but this to us to the seals
[48:07] anybody got any questions now just to
[48:09] the seals or what this or what that
[48:12] and then we'll cover some things of the
[48:14] questions that are related to it
[48:16] are our redemption and the redemption of
[48:19] mankind look
[48:20] hold on just me i'm gonna have to get to
[48:23] brother um
[48:38] uh i predict before the coming of the
[48:41] lord jesus
[48:42] god will sink that place don't come
[48:43] before your los angeles
[48:45] so that is what you've been saying just
[48:48] it just
[48:48] took care of that right we'll be here
[48:52] i predict before the coming of the lord
[48:56] and his prediction i'll take him
[48:59] i'll take that we're about the rest
[49:01] wouldn't you also he said you know
[49:03] he said your main goal on the book is
[49:05] sanctification right
[49:06] well you code you you that's that's
[49:09] your you haven't even got your new
[49:11] birthday but see you move on
[49:13] and you move right on into what you're
[49:14] talking about so
[49:16] they should start exposing or revealing
[49:19] or bringing you into your position
[49:21] and revealing your name by the word
[49:24] that's preached to you
[49:25] that you take it it comes into your mind
[49:28] and go down through the channels and
[49:30] you're so when he brings it back right
[49:31] there
[49:32] he lets you know right right exactly
[49:38] you see when your name goes on judas is
[49:41] 91 on the book of life
[49:44] he was part of a religious order but it
[49:46] was taken out
[49:50] because he didn't go on
[49:54] that's how i used it to be
[49:58] anybody else any comments
[50:01] thoughts
[50:05] i don't want to know what's on your
[50:06] heart don't worry about saying brother i
[50:09] don't agree with you
[50:12] you know my father you
[50:15] don't bother me because i know one or
[50:18] two things neither i haven't made myself
[50:20] clear
[50:22] you know and that's the one thing i want
[50:23] to make sure did i say it clear
[50:26] and direct you know what i say to word
[50:29] it
[50:30] you know you can say well you know i
[50:32] don't agree with this
[50:33] but then i can say well okay this is
[50:35] what i believe when we ended up talking
[50:40] because i believe the complete plan of
[50:41] redemption is exactly what it is
[50:45] it reveals all redemption
[50:48] then brother garrett you hold it when
[50:52] you raise your hands
[50:52] we get to that we want the microphone to
[50:55] maybe this is a little bit
[50:56] uh outside but those ages that have
[51:00] gone before us move through wesley and
[51:02] the ones down through there
[51:03] we know that the mystery of redemption
[51:05] comes in the end time
[51:07] are they going when when this is all
[51:10] over
[51:10] uh and the rapture takes place
[51:14] where where are they going to be an
[51:15] understanding are they going to be at
[51:17] the capstone is there going to be a
[51:19] capstone understanding or will they grow
[51:21] in in
[51:23] knowledge over the time that we spend in
[51:26] eternity or where will they be after
[51:28] they receive their bodies
[51:29] their natural you know their physical
[51:31] body and understanding of the plan of
[51:34] redemption
[51:34] right
[51:38] i see no problem with the fact that
[51:40] luther wesleyan
[51:42] what they talked as to where when we get
[51:46] over there
[51:46] you know that we could sit down and talk
[51:49] about things and they could understand
[51:51] things
[51:53] you know i don't believe that when we
[51:55] leave out of this world that is going to
[51:56] change us
[51:57] from what we are that's where the
[52:00] prophet said it right he says what i am
[52:01] here
[52:02] that's what i am there all right but
[52:05] the fact is they're going to be there
[52:07] first number one lutheran wesley and
[52:09] them
[52:09] the people who taught the the you know
[52:12] started out with the
[52:13] the just shall live by faith they're
[52:15] going to be there that's part of the
[52:16] bride of jesus christ
[52:19] but that way we'll have something to
[52:20] talk about
[52:23] you just think about even in the in the
[52:25] millennium
[52:27] a thousand years of being able to talk
[52:29] about jesus christ
[52:31] i might get all i needed to say in that
[52:33] moment
[52:36] that way you could have four-hour
[52:37] services and nobody gets tired
[52:41] you would not worry about it but i
[52:44] believe we'll still be growing in grace
[52:46] and knowledge
[52:49] when we get there i believe it'll be the
[52:51] i believe what we get here
[52:53] is just enough to take us there
[52:57] then when we get there go how can you
[53:01] how can you exhaust the word
[53:06] if the word had no beginning and has no
[53:09] end
[53:10] how can you ever exhaust it so the
[53:13] prophet said that we'd receive the
[53:14] message of cheer
[53:16] down to the endless ages it won't be a
[53:19] redemptive message to redeem us
[53:23] because they'll already be redeemed
[53:25] luther west of them already be redeemed
[53:27] be there any eternal just as
[53:28] much as anybody
[53:32] but what would be the problem with us
[53:34] sitting down talking with them about it
[53:37] and you know when you get about the iron
[53:39] it is you know the women preach your
[53:41] doctrine to be gone
[53:45] you understand what i mean by that in
[53:47] this time elements in ways
[53:49] stay out a little bit talk about the
[53:52] word of god
[53:54] but don't try to preach there'll come a
[53:57] time where there won't be no problems
[54:00] there'll be no preacher standing there
[54:01] saying you can't preach sister brenda
[54:04] go sit down
[54:08] uh
[54:17] see it'll be a wonderful opportunity to
[54:21] be able to talk about
[54:23] you know we don't all see now i
[54:25] understand what i'm saying to the point
[54:26] of
[54:27] answer we don't all see god
[54:30] identically word for word points
[54:35] because if it did it wouldn't be a body
[54:36] of christ that's right now we all see
[54:38] the one god
[54:39] we all see the revelation of god but yet
[54:43] you uh brother would be had a good point
[54:46] he said no one with a holy ghost
[54:50] said you can tell yourself if you listen
[54:51] to her i believe that
[54:55] somebody don't even know how to hardly
[54:57] write their name or sister birds i told
[54:59] you about that
[55:00] i preached one night for an hour and a
[55:02] half
[55:04] how did he come from god and he went to
[55:06] god
[55:07] and i was trying my best to explain that
[55:10] and on the way home she said brother
[55:11] dale
[55:12] said i saw it okay she said he come from
[55:16] god and he went to god
[55:17] said he was god all the time
[55:21] i said i spent an hour and a half trying
[55:23] to explain that
[55:24] and you put it in five words could i
[55:27] believe that
[55:31] i believe lutheran wesley would be glad
[55:33] to sit down and listen but you know what
[55:34] i'll be glad to sit down listen to him
[55:36] talk about justification
[55:39] now because it wasn't a doctrine when
[55:42] luther saw that
[55:44] it destroyed catholicism as the work
[55:49] to get us to salvation it didn't destroy
[55:54] living for jesus christ or being good it
[55:57] destroyed
[55:58] what they were teaching what a wonderful
[56:01] time it'll be
[56:04] what a wonderful time anything else
[56:08] anybody else sister
[56:11] anna
[56:15] someone um because back in
[56:18] africa my dad always worries about his
[56:22] grandmother
[56:23] because they never knew english and they
[56:25] never knew of jesus
[56:27] and the fact that god will raise the
[56:30] heathen
[56:30] in the millennium and give him a chance
[56:33] so i could see them there
[56:36] now um you say all names
[56:40] are revealed made known under the sixth
[56:42] seal
[56:44] i don't understand what the statement
[56:46] means you mean
[56:47] nobody everybody who's been
[56:50] on this world is all
[56:53] under the sixth seal because the stick
[56:56] still is the
[57:03] okay in other words you were reading the
[57:05] book
[57:07] and and you look over the back
[57:10] and in the back of the book you've got
[57:12] all of the people that wrote the book
[57:14] right their names are there you know
[57:17] so-and-so's and we appreciate this
[57:18] person that so you got a group of nines
[57:22] that don't put them all the way through
[57:23] the book the it just simply means what
[57:27] brother dane was saying when a peace
[57:28] person comes to sanctification
[57:31] brother ron said your name goes on the
[57:32] book as a believer
[57:35] he even brought up the old testament
[57:36] science with that form
[57:38] and how that they brought in a bullet
[57:40] being a believer
[57:42] and it would set them aside from being
[57:44] what everybody else was
[57:46] be a believer see god puts your name in
[57:49] the book of life not in the lounge book
[57:51] of life because
[57:52] that's the eternal section those were
[57:54] put there before the foundation of the
[57:56] world or never will be put there
[57:57] now there will be a moving of names when
[57:59] they get to
[58:00] to the watch on judgments you can move
[58:02] the names of the foolish virgins
[58:04] but then there will be pride and things
[58:07] that is how their flight is
[58:09] but see my point is that by the time
[58:11] that seal opens
[58:14] which is not open yet right okay see by
[58:17] that time
[58:18] every name that would ever be made known
[58:21] on earth
[58:23] he's been brought on earth
[58:26] good or bad see every name by that time
[58:30] is brought on earth because if not a
[58:33] bunch of names come on later to be
[58:34] handed on down through
[58:36] see the names has already come everybody
[58:38] that would ever
[58:40] live on earth if the sixth seal is the
[58:43] end of the world
[58:45] all right then that would be ending of
[58:48] redemption
[58:50] okay so does it mean no children are
[58:52] born in the millennium
[58:53] the way some people think i sure don't
[58:57] want to think about being born from the
[58:58] bride
[59:00] now i'll balk on you in a hurry if you
[59:03] say they're born from the bride
[59:04] now brother and said i don't know
[59:08] he said it looks like they may be and
[59:10] looks like they're not but
[59:12] i'll stand firm on one thing
[59:15] that's what i do when i make a statement
[59:17] i stand with that statement that i make
[59:20] i'll stand on one thing there ain't
[59:21] gonna be no kids born from eternal
[59:23] people in the millennium
[59:26] because that's gonna put sex back in the
[59:27] wrong place
[59:29] and you certainly don't want that in a
[59:31] glorified body you know an eternal moral
[59:34] body human being not going to have sex
[59:37] he brought around when they went beyond
[59:38] the curtain of time he could hug no
[59:39] sisters
[59:40] no problem
[59:43] notice all gone
[59:46] it ain't gonna be like i remember
[59:48] telling a lady one time and
[59:50] i got so tickled until because it was
[59:52] what she was doing
[59:53] and we were talking about that you know
[59:56] that one day we'd be made eternal and i
[59:59] said you'd be like 21 years old or
[1:00:01] something like that you know
[1:00:04] and this expression came over her face
[1:00:08] and she went
[1:00:14] well i had a problem with reading this
[1:00:16] expression
[1:00:17] because i kind of figured what she's
[1:00:19] thinking about she's thinking about them
[1:00:21] curves coming back
[1:00:22] she was thinking about all of that 21
[1:00:25] years old
[1:00:26] instead of you know the little pudgy
[1:00:33] see it's going to be a wonderful time
[1:00:36] wonderful time thank you
[1:00:40] one more question what do you think my
[1:00:42] folks will look like those
[1:00:44] heathen that will be raised in the
[1:00:45] millennium will they be
[1:00:47] 21 year old will they be in the
[1:00:49] theophany or
[1:00:51] will they be natural
[1:00:55] you would think that that wouldn't put
[1:00:57] in a complicated form but
[1:00:58] i'm not meaning you are i mean
[1:01:02] when those either to me that are raised
[1:01:03] in the millennium
[1:01:05] i don't believe they'll be raised at 45
[1:01:07] years old
[1:01:08] but i don't believe they'd be raised up
[1:01:10] as kids
[1:01:12] there would be no use of it see it's not
[1:01:14] a point
[1:01:15] um bring them up into youth
[1:01:19] you know now not in eternal do you
[1:01:22] understand that's why it's hard to
[1:01:23] express something i don't believe the
[1:01:26] healing when they're raised up will be
[1:01:27] eternal
[1:01:28] that's right because there wouldn't be
[1:01:30] any need of calling them up
[1:01:32] they won't have eternal life now if they
[1:01:35] get eternal life while the gospel being
[1:01:37] preached to them
[1:01:38] you can believe that if you want to i'm
[1:01:40] not going to argue
[1:01:41] and i'm going to say neither way because
[1:01:43] i don't know
[1:01:44] but i believe they'll come up as a young
[1:01:47] people
[1:01:50] and all of that now i can't understand
[1:01:52] how that the
[1:01:53] millennial scripture says that uh uh
[1:01:57] they will die at a hundred or something
[1:01:58] which what it is and instead of sinner
[1:02:00] or not hurts i don't understand that
[1:02:01] admonishment
[1:02:03] i know how they understand it maybe you
[1:02:05] do could explain it to me
[1:02:06] but i believe the heathen when they come
[1:02:09] up
[1:02:11] that you you know and i'm not saying
[1:02:12] your grandmother
[1:02:14] because maybe she heard of jesus christ
[1:02:16] some way
[1:02:18] see we don't know what we'll say
[1:02:21] maybe she didn't see me all right then
[1:02:23] god can judge her according to
[1:02:26] how she lived in her tribe and her
[1:02:29] beings and her life
[1:02:30] and he can raise her up in the
[1:02:32] millennium and how the gospel preached
[1:02:34] to it because you think
[1:02:36] see i know that we
[1:02:39] we put a lot of emphasis on brother
[1:02:40] brown was a prophet
[1:02:43] but do you realize where we'd be if you
[1:02:46] didn't believe who's the prophet
[1:02:49] you realize that right i need about two
[1:02:52] hours right now
[1:02:54] you just think for him to say that a
[1:02:57] heather and there's no bible
[1:02:59] to say us a heathen will be raised up in
[1:03:02] the millennium
[1:03:03] now you can go back and pick up
[1:03:04] scriptures and see that you're speaking
[1:03:06] of these things
[1:03:07] but i'm saying no scripture this this
[1:03:10] this
[1:03:10] there's no scripture that says the filth
[1:03:13] sealed you sold under the altar
[1:03:16] is all the israelites or something
[1:03:20] it doesn't say that i think when we
[1:03:22] received a prophet
[1:03:24] he was to turn us back to the word
[1:03:28] to what the word is really saying that's
[1:03:30] right
[1:03:31] and you think about it you say well how
[1:03:32] do you know about this either
[1:03:36] what's your thoughts
[1:03:40] i believe in a just god
[1:03:44] it will not condemn people without
[1:03:46] bringing them to a judgment
[1:03:48] right
[1:03:51] what do you believe that's right
[1:03:55] my god is not a dodeo granddaddy
[1:03:59] but when he says it he'll keep his word
[1:04:04] and that heathen that never has heard
[1:04:07] what are you going to do with
[1:04:11] you won't throw them into hell because
[1:04:12] they never heard
[1:04:17] you see folks we've had more than a
[1:04:20] prophet
[1:04:23] we've had the mind of god delivered
[1:04:27] through a prophet
[1:04:31] to speak to you and i have you never
[1:04:34] thought about the people of the world
[1:04:36] that has never heard about jesus
[1:04:44] where's those people going what's it
[1:04:46] going to be
[1:04:48] but a prophet says a heathen could be
[1:04:50] raised up
[1:04:53] i shouted glory hallelujah when i heard
[1:04:55] that
[1:04:57] when i heard him talking about that feel
[1:04:59] sealed jew
[1:05:00] and realizing what he was saying that
[1:05:02] those jews that are real sincere jews
[1:05:05] that never heard of jesus christ
[1:05:08] back over there in those countries you
[1:05:09] know sent to the world because of the
[1:05:12] scattering
[1:05:13] but you're saved they'll be brought up
[1:05:20] you see the salvation i've got has no
[1:05:22] limits
[1:05:24] now the word keeps me from giving it to
[1:05:27] everybody
[1:05:30] i hope you understand that statement i
[1:05:32] can't go out and give salvation to
[1:05:33] everybody you can't either
[1:05:36] but i can give it to those who believe
[1:05:38] you say give it to him
[1:05:40] i can preach to him can't you
[1:05:43] can't you offer it sisters whatever
[1:05:46] you're talking to your neighbor
[1:05:47] can't you offer them eternal life yes
[1:05:50] if they'll believe the word
[1:05:54] is that what you're talking about to you
[1:05:57] anything else
[1:05:59] yeah sister trudy never coming this way
[1:06:08] that los angeles quake is going to be a
[1:06:11] really devastating situation
[1:06:13] exactly it's going to totally break this
[1:06:15] country
[1:06:16] but i'm wondering about bride that's
[1:06:19] going to be
[1:06:19] involved in that tidal wave when you
[1:06:22] look at our administrative fear
[1:06:25] will the bride be at the same level of
[1:06:28] revelation
[1:06:29] and can they somehow speak
[1:06:32] and be protected from that tight away
[1:06:39] sorry i'm glad you're asking me what i
[1:06:44] believe
[1:06:47] i'm like this if god told me to go to
[1:06:51] california today
[1:06:52] i'd pack up a girl i wouldn't be worried
[1:06:56] about it
[1:07:03] i wouldn't be concerned about that pack
[1:07:05] up and go
[1:07:07] but when i would keep asking him how
[1:07:10] long do you want me to stay here
[1:07:15] and if he said one england go home
[1:07:19] i wouldn't spend no time selling my home
[1:07:22] i would spend no time telling my boss at
[1:07:24] work i had to leave
[1:07:26] i would be on a plane head
[1:07:30] east or somewhere i'm i'm actually as
[1:07:33] honest as i can
[1:07:35] because the
[1:07:38] what would you do
[1:07:42] he said well there's a lot of people out
[1:07:43] in california that believe the message
[1:07:47] are they there because
[1:07:51] god told them to be there
[1:07:54] are they they are just
[1:07:57] um rebellious
[1:08:03] now i'm not throwing off on people just
[1:08:05] making statements
[1:08:06] brother told those people when he was
[1:08:08] there in the opening of the seals
[1:08:10] not to go to arizona
[1:08:17] he told them don't go
[1:08:21] they made statements one did from here
[1:08:23] two did
[1:08:25] that brother round later told him said
[1:08:27] you caught more of it than i did
[1:08:29] because he went
[1:08:33] i'm not going to argue with him i'm just
[1:08:36] going to say brother brown said they're
[1:08:38] out there starving to death
[1:08:42] and you know that even for many many
[1:08:44] years they poached
[1:08:47] illegally gang to feed those people that
[1:08:50] was out there
[1:08:52] and brought around you about it now
[1:08:55] that's their words
[1:08:56] okay right around told one of them said
[1:09:00] hunt high
[1:09:01] and the game warden won't get you
[1:09:05] now i believe he said that
[1:09:08] i'm not going to doubt the brother but
[1:09:10] i'm just making a point
[1:09:12] he told them not to go he said that's my
[1:09:15] kids out there starving
[1:09:17] what was he going to do
[1:09:23] yeah they thought they were led of the
[1:09:25] lord to go out there
[1:09:28] it's all right this leading of the lord
[1:09:31] is a mighty
[1:09:32] thing most of our leading of the lord is
[1:09:35] leading
[1:09:36] myself and get the lord sometimes might
[1:09:38] agree with it
[1:09:42] but i'm just giving that as an answer if
[1:09:45] i was in california right now i'd be
[1:09:46] praying
[1:09:49] and i said lord do you want me out here
[1:09:53] if you don't ask me what time the next
[1:09:55] plane leaves i'm going to be on that
[1:09:57] airplane
[1:10:00] because i've never believed in being
[1:10:02] done stupid i can't help that
[1:10:05] i was born right away but being dumb is
[1:10:08] a different situation
[1:10:11] well hey people will bless god god will
[1:10:13] come and get me
[1:10:16] how many years ago
[1:10:20] did i preach to you that the biggest
[1:10:23] portion of the people that was in this
[1:10:25] bride would have to die and go by the
[1:10:26] grave
[1:10:28] how many years has that been 30
[1:10:31] probably
[1:10:34] right because i may be one of them
[1:10:40] time keeps on going i'm sure we'll so
[1:10:43] will you
[1:10:44] gonna get too old
[1:10:48] but the point is i could see
[1:10:52] that the reason it's gonna come
[1:10:56] is because we won't line up
[1:10:59] and i titled the message persecution not
[1:11:02] tribulation
[1:11:04] persecution why we must have it
[1:11:09] because it is we're not honest people
[1:11:10] who get down to seriousness
[1:11:14] and we need god to jog us that's right
[1:11:19] if god told me today said move to new
[1:11:21] york
[1:11:24] because george is going under
[1:11:27] i say well
[1:11:32] show it to him in the word lord that's
[1:11:35] all i've asked him
[1:11:37] if he showed it to him in the word i'd
[1:11:40] be leaving tomorrow
[1:11:44] to go to new york that's what he told me
[1:11:47] but i believe in doing what he tells us
[1:11:48] to do
[1:11:49] i believe he can shield us and if you're
[1:11:52] getting what i'm saying
[1:11:54] those who are really in the word in
[1:11:56] california
[1:11:59] i would be close to moving
[1:12:03] yesterday well you don't believe the
[1:12:05] lord take care of him
[1:12:08] i don't believe in tempting him either
[1:12:14] come on i believe in doing what he says
[1:12:21] he says california is fixing to go under
[1:12:26] you can see what i'm talking about that
[1:12:28] they could be a vast majority of the
[1:12:29] people
[1:12:30] of this message that would be in
[1:12:31] california would go down in the ground
[1:12:37] of course i've never thought off on
[1:12:40] nobody
[1:12:42] maybe you don't think like i think
[1:12:46] i'm sure you don't sorry about that
[1:12:50] but see those people could go under
[1:12:55] the earthquake and tomorrow be raised
[1:13:00] from the dead to stand on earth
[1:13:04] brother dale give me scripture okay i'm
[1:13:07] glad you asked for that one
[1:13:09] according to my understanding in
[1:13:11] revelations
[1:13:12] 13 those two witnesses are going to die
[1:13:16] and lay there in the streets for three
[1:13:18] and a half days
[1:13:21] not three and a half years or three
[1:13:23] minutes later three and a half days
[1:13:25] and they're going to raise
[1:13:29] so they must go as they die into the
[1:13:32] sixth dimension
[1:13:35] where all christians go and then they'd
[1:13:38] be released from there to come up
[1:13:41] so california could go under and those
[1:13:43] people can go down with it
[1:13:44] georgia could go under and you and i
[1:13:46] could go with it
[1:13:50] but we'll be up very shortly
[1:13:53] i'm not de-christianizing nobody
[1:13:57] you could come up in a hurry and get out
[1:14:00] of here
[1:14:02] if you die and go by the grave i die and
[1:14:03] go by the grave don't say i'm lost
[1:14:05] i never talked nothing like that in all
[1:14:07] my life
[1:14:12] i've trying to preach the truth
[1:14:16] i got in trouble years ago explaining
[1:14:18] that a manifested son
[1:14:19] could die and go by the grave before the
[1:14:22] change
[1:14:25] i fought that heavily
[1:14:28] but you don't want the ones who said
[1:14:30] they
[1:14:32] didn't believe it
[1:14:36] they already died and gone the grave
[1:14:42] i'm still here
[1:14:46] this is the church i've just tried to
[1:14:48] explain salvation redemption
[1:14:52] don't say that somebody that dies that
[1:14:54] they don't have the faith
[1:14:56] right we're under the curse of the world
[1:15:01] we'll take another few seconds and then
[1:15:03] we'll take this afternoon the rest of
[1:15:04] the question
[1:15:07] we're in the curse of this world because
[1:15:10] you're sick doesn't mean you're lost
[1:15:12] doesn't mean you're done wrong it means
[1:15:14] we're under the curse
[1:15:15] because old age is a curse
[1:15:20] it is placed upon us because of a curse
[1:15:24] some people's genetic dna makeups or
[1:15:27] what you want to call them are stronger
[1:15:28] than others
[1:15:30] and they can fight off diseases and be
[1:15:32] healthier and
[1:15:33] and do things but we're still dying
[1:15:39] and we're going to keep dying until
[1:15:40] somebody comes to the place
[1:15:43] that we can walk out here that group of
[1:15:46] people that's going to be standing there
[1:15:48] going to have to call that dead out of
[1:15:49] the ground
[1:15:51] you say if california went under today
[1:15:53] brother dale would you say
[1:15:55] oh we missed it now i'd say we're going
[1:15:58] to call for you
[1:16:03] see you can't explain what a prophet is
[1:16:05] expressing
[1:16:08] it looks like the whole united states
[1:16:10] would be totally annihilated
[1:16:13] don't have to be california can go under
[1:16:15] florida goes up ever run around and send
[1:16:20] a tidal wave all the way to kentucky
[1:16:26] it's all right you know that one time in
[1:16:30] history the mississippi river run
[1:16:32] upstream
[1:16:34] because of an earthquake you ever
[1:16:35] studied that
[1:16:37] they can prove it it ran upstream
[1:16:42] caused an earthquake see if you backed
[1:16:45] up the mississippi river
[1:16:50] and that hippie is what is the ohio is
[1:16:51] that the next you know my rivers are off
[1:16:53] you put them in the place watch me look
[1:16:55] at the mouth
[1:16:55] okay but my point is if you backed up
[1:16:59] the mississippi river backed up the ohio
[1:17:00] river you'd shoot the tidal wave into
[1:17:02] kentucky
[1:17:03] it wouldn't have to destroy what's here
[1:17:07] i've always just tried to be sensible
[1:17:10] but brother dale i've seen that
[1:17:12] earthquake and just come all the way
[1:17:13] across the united states now run around
[1:17:15] where'd he say that
[1:17:18] he said it died away well he's got to
[1:17:21] come all the way
[1:17:22] no back up the mississippi river should
[1:17:25] have died away
[1:17:28] the world would be killed it so much
[1:17:29] because when california goes down
[1:17:31] florida could be the peninsula right for
[1:17:34] the world
[1:17:38] you see we're trying to interpret a
[1:17:39] profit
[1:17:41] in visions am i doing
[1:17:45] something sensible
[1:17:50] i hope that's the answer what you're
[1:17:51] talking about if i was out there i'd be
[1:17:53] packing up ready to go home
[1:17:54] you know get out of there and then i'd
[1:17:57] be coming
[1:17:58] somewhere but where to go i mean that's
[1:18:01] a good point to them where to go
[1:18:05] where can you go
[1:18:09] run around and told us what to do he
[1:18:10] said i just got it
[1:18:12] he said they want to know where the
[1:18:14] place is where we need to be
[1:18:17] he said now brother and sister i just
[1:18:18] got it
[1:18:20] you know there's asking should we move
[1:18:21] to arizona should we do this
[1:18:24] he said i just got it he said we need to
[1:18:26] be in jesus christ
[1:18:28] amen that's right amen
[1:18:34] no matter where we are we need to be in
[1:18:37] jesus christ
[1:18:41] i'd rather be standing on the mountain
[1:18:43] though
[1:18:45] then the okay pinocchio
[1:18:51] the only problem it might roll over but
[1:18:54] it's a whole lot stronger right right
[1:18:58] that's why i haven't moved to california
[1:19:00] you know the lord said go to california
[1:19:04] i would first off say it wasn't my
[1:19:07] i hope you i hope you
[1:19:10] you're telling me what to do in the
[1:19:12] right way
[1:19:14] because i sure don't want to go because
[1:19:15] of my own intentions
[1:19:17] you know my own thoughts
[1:19:20] we'll take this afternoon because it's
[1:19:22] nearly 12.
[1:19:25] now you got one third of it
[1:19:31] i didn't mean that wrong we have 10
[1:19:34] minutes
[1:19:37] no mr anna i had that question too
[1:19:41] and what i got from the
[1:19:44] beginning of the book he gave it to adam
[1:19:48] and said adam you filled this book up
[1:19:51] with both the word children
[1:19:53] names and spoken word children well adam
[1:19:57] failed because they failed so
[1:20:00] god took the book back from adam and he
[1:20:03] started putting names
[1:20:05] of all the redeemed that were saved
[1:20:09] baptized for the holy ghost he started
[1:20:11] putting names in that
[1:20:13] that he died for so that is the book
[1:20:17] that went back to the hand of god
[1:20:20] from adam because adam failed he did not
[1:20:23] put
[1:20:23] the name under the spoken word children
[1:20:26] so god took the book back so he started
[1:20:29] redeeming them
[1:20:31] and he put the redeemed names in that
[1:20:33] book and when
[1:20:35] the world was over when the sixth seal
[1:20:37] all the redeemed names were
[1:20:39] going in there oh well foolish virgin
[1:20:42] might go in there but uh that's when the
[1:20:45] book
[1:20:46] is closed because all the redeemed names
[1:20:49] are in that book
[1:20:50] so i'm very simple but that really
[1:20:52] helped me when i saw that
[1:20:55] i don't think it's too simple i think
[1:20:57] it's the truth
[1:20:59] no god knows how to work all these dudes
[1:21:03] ain't nothing out of cater brother dale
[1:21:06] we've been here all these years and
[1:21:08] we've been still believing the same
[1:21:10] message yeah
[1:21:13] because god's been trying us to see what
[1:21:15] we'll do
[1:21:17] see if we believe what he says here
[1:21:19] regardless of everything goes wrong
[1:21:23] you see yeah but i see this and i see
[1:21:26] that
[1:21:29] you know that god told noah
[1:21:33] get in the honor
[1:21:36] no rain in seven days
[1:21:45] you better go read your bible and read
[1:21:46] your prophecy it didn't rain
[1:21:51] in seven days
[1:22:00] did god lie no
[1:22:03] he was just extending time to let other
[1:22:05] people think about it it rained the
[1:22:10] seventh day
[1:22:13] you remember brother brown and said the
[1:22:15] kids come around to know and they said
[1:22:16] no you said it don't rain in saturday
[1:22:18] you said god said he said
[1:22:22] he'll rain
[1:22:26] he's been trying us for a long time
[1:22:31] to see what we'll do even when things go
[1:22:35] wrong
[1:22:35] it doesn't look like it ought to be
[1:22:41] when i said we could pass the year 2026
[1:22:44] i never had no thoughts whatsoever
[1:22:46] in wanting that to happen
[1:22:49] i wanted it to take place that day
[1:22:52] i was just saying what the prophet had
[1:22:56] said
[1:23:02] i believe the reveal worked
[1:23:06] and i had it wrote in my notes not all
[1:23:08] the words we read
[1:23:12] a lot of difference in the word we read
[1:23:14] and the reveal
[1:23:19] no word you know that those old
[1:23:21] testament
[1:23:22] scribes and things they could take that
[1:23:25] old testament stand in jesus face
[1:23:27] and say according to the bible this is
[1:23:30] the way it's supposed to be he's coming
[1:23:34] at the mighty conqueror
[1:23:40] and he did
[1:23:44] right but they failed to take the other
[1:23:47] one that said he would
[1:23:49] he was a baby
[1:23:54] and see that that baby laying in that
[1:23:56] manger was the mighty conqueror
[1:24:03] bible's right it's our interpretation
[1:24:05] what we got you might have a need you
[1:24:07] are 176 and sparring
[1:24:08] one second we'll take up the question
[1:24:11] this afternoon
