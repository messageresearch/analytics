[0:56] a man it's gonna be in the house of the
[1:05] Lord again you ready to just worship the
[1:08] Lord tonight and I'll tell you what it's
[1:13] good to make up be a message believer
[1:15] tonight if anybody should know how to
[1:17] worship God it should be us right with
[1:21] all that's been poured out to us and all
[1:23] that's been shown to us tonight I want
[1:27] to look at 2nd Kings chapter 8 and just
[1:31] kind of look at a little a little story
[1:33] here tonight maybe just kind of help us
[1:36] in the middle of the week or maybe one
[1:40] day short of the middle of the week but
[1:43] anyway let's just go to the Lord in
[1:45] prayer before we get into the word Lord
[1:48] God we're so happy Lord Jesus to be able
[1:50] to serve you night and to be able to
[1:52] look into your word and see what your
[1:54] will is for us we pray God that you will
[1:57] open up the ears of the hearer Lord and
[1:59] open up my mouth to speak your truth
[2:01] Lord Jesus and we ask Lord that you will
[2:03] just feel welcome here tonight Lord that
[2:06] you would come and your spirit Lord
[2:07] would just move over the word just like
[2:09] the same way that you moved over the
[2:11] waters Lord before as the world was
[2:14] being formed Lord and just created an
[2:16] atmosphere of worship here Lord Jesus
[2:18] that we might be able to receive exactly
[2:20] what is neat needful for us now in this
[2:23] time Lord we thank you Lord Jesus for
[2:25] your word that you've given unto us Lord
[2:27] and we know that when your word has
[2:29] spoken it will not return void but it
[2:31] will produce what it was intended to
[2:33] produce we asked Lord Jesus tonight Lord
[2:35] God that our hearts would be willing
[2:37] Lord Jesus to receive your word or Lord
[2:40] and to accept the things that have been
[2:42] preached Lord Jesus granite Lord God
[2:44] that you'll Lord come and just quicken
[2:47] the word to us now we pray let's not
[2:50] just be it just to just just a normal
[2:53] gathering lord but lord gathering of the
[2:56] true worshipers that know the revelation
[2:58] and the purpose for the hour of that
[3:00] we're living in Lord to know your will
[3:02] for this hour we ask this thing in the
[3:05] name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen so
[3:09] tonight I want to preach on
[3:10] the will of God and maybe taking a
[3:15] little odd scripture from the from the
[3:18] Bible but it's you know the Old
[3:21] Testament especially that first and
[3:23] second Kings are so full of these little
[3:26] nuggets of stories that that I was
[3:29] reading this story to my to my family a
[3:31] few weeks ago and you know these little
[3:35] stories I believe really are like a
[3:37] proof that the message of the hour that
[3:40] we believe is true because after
[3:43] studying the message and all of these
[3:44] things you can go back into the Old
[3:46] Testament and see surfaced the things
[3:49] that we believe and hold dear we know
[3:51] that the message is true and the Bible
[3:53] is true because of how these things tie
[3:55] so perfectly together and how it's just
[3:58] interlaced and the things that we
[4:00] believe are not just some fable
[4:03] cunningly devised fables we believe are
[4:05] true so let's look at 2nd Kings chapter
[4:09] 8 verses 1 through 6 and maybe cops at
[4:12] your attention to you know maybe brother
[4:14] Matthew if he were here he would point
[4:16] out the number the numeric value of this
[4:18] this particular chapter number 8 if it
[4:21] is very striking that this story appears
[4:25] in second Kings vet chapter 8 and he
[4:29] says then speak Elisha unto the woman
[4:31] the woman is not named
[4:33] she's never named here whose son he had
[4:36] restored the life saying arise and go
[4:38] thou and thine household and sojourn
[4:41] where wheresoever thou canst sojourn for
[4:44] the Lord hath called for a famine and it
[4:46] shall also come upon the land 7 years
[4:49] and the woman arose and did after the
[4:52] saying of the man of God and she went
[4:55] with her household and sojourned in the
[4:57] land of the Philistines 7 years and it
[5:00] came to pass at the seven years end that
[5:02] the woman returned out of the land of
[5:04] the Philistines and she went forth to
[5:06] cry under the King for her house and
[5:08] forward land and the king talked with
[5:11] Ghazi the servant of the man of God
[5:13] saying tell me I pray thee all the great
[5:15] things that Elisha had done and it came
[5:18] to pass as he was telling the King how
[5:20] he had restored a dead body to life that
[5:22] behold the woman who
[5:23] sun-hee had restored the life cried to
[5:26] the king for her house and forward land
[5:28] and kaha Zi said my lord o king this is
[5:30] the woman and this is her son whom
[5:33] Elijah restored the life and when the
[5:35] King asked the woman she told him so the
[5:38] King appointed unto her a certain
[5:40] officer saying restore all that was hers
[5:43] and all the fruits of the fields since
[5:46] the day that she left the land even
[5:49] until now you might be seen may be
[5:51] seated the Lord blessed the word and and
[5:55] of course many of you here are already
[5:58] catching the revelation of what of what
[6:00] this is kind of hidden in this little
[6:03] story and you might wonder what brother
[6:06] Bob or how why did you take from this
[6:09] text there will a topic of the will of
[6:12] God why would you read this story and
[6:14] begin to talk about the will of God well
[6:18] I believe I believe in this hour that
[6:20] we're living in there are many people
[6:21] maybe maybe even tonight that are
[6:23] probing and searching for the will of
[6:25] God and their life and they don't know
[6:27] how to find it and they don't know what
[6:29] it is and they don't know I began it
[6:31] just kind of thinking about and
[6:34] meditating on this sermon I began to
[6:35] listen to a denominational preacher that
[6:38] preached a pretty good sermon on the
[6:40] will of God but you know I would even I
[6:43] would even pause it just this afternoon
[6:44] I would I would throw out that
[6:46] denominational churches do not know what
[6:49] the will of God is they can they know it
[6:51] to a certain extent or whatever but only
[6:53] the Bride of Christ only the bride and
[6:56] this day that has heard the message of
[6:57] the hour knows the will of God the
[7:00] purpose and plan to be able to sit here
[7:02] tonight and know what your purpose is
[7:04] and know why you're sitting here and
[7:06] have an understanding of what you're
[7:08] doing here and and what you've heard and
[7:10] know the will of God and you know that
[7:13] the will of God this little woman I
[7:16] believe she she had a she is a this
[7:21] little woman will I believe Titus the
[7:23] bride because she she was a woman that
[7:27] our desire was to seek after the will of
[7:30] God she wanted to be walking in the
[7:33] perfect will of God for her life
[7:35] she wanted to be her life to be lined up
[7:39] in the right way and you know a few
[7:41] chapters back if you go read where her
[7:44] story starts she she one day that
[7:47] prophet Elijah began to come through and
[7:48] she said she called ahold that this man
[7:51] was something something was different
[7:53] about this man and she told her husband
[7:55] who was getting a little bit older in
[7:56] years she said I I think that this is a
[7:59] man of God so she prepared a place she
[8:01] talked to her husband and to make it a
[8:03] little room in her house and you see
[8:06] when you recognize the word and you make
[8:08] a room and hear in your heart for the
[8:10] word and allow him to come and abide and
[8:13] you just like she made room in her house
[8:15] for the word to come then you'll receive
[8:17] what you're doing is you're lining
[8:19] yourself up with the will of God you're
[8:21] getting it at maybe maybe tonight I know
[8:24] many people have different kind of
[8:26] conceptions of what the will of God is
[8:28] and some people think it's like
[8:29] connecting dots if you can kind of go
[8:32] from one place to another but tonight
[8:34] maybe I was just kind of want to paint a
[8:36] picture of the will of God is like if
[8:38] you're being nestled under Inka eagle's
[8:40] wings if you're nestled safe and secure
[8:44] under the wings of God you are firmly in
[8:46] to the will of God and so she maybe had
[8:49] dots of her life going all different
[8:52] directions but yet she was her life she
[8:54] was she wanted the word of God you see
[8:58] she wanted she wanted what this prophet
[9:01] had to say she wanted a connection to
[9:03] God and so first of all in her life she
[9:06] recognized a man of God and she invited
[9:09] her him into her home and and what she
[9:12] did was she prepared a resting place for
[9:14] him so that when he was weary he didn't
[9:16] have a place to rest his head and and
[9:18] you know the whole and the whole story
[9:20] she never asked anything for herself it
[9:23] was all given to this man this man of
[9:26] God and so when he came and he told his
[9:28] servant this I want to do something for
[9:30] this woman I want to do something for it
[9:33] and and gauzy look what she doesn't have
[9:35] a child and she never asked for a child
[9:37] but but God God laid upon Elijah's heart
[9:43] to speak that word to her to give her a
[9:45] son to promise her a son
[9:48] that he would give give her this give
[9:51] her this promise you see and then the
[9:53] promised son died and and and yet she
[9:56] clung she clung to this desire to know
[9:59] the will of God why did my son die and
[10:02] so she went chasing after Elijah with
[10:05] that positive confession that we know so
[10:07] much about all as well she told her
[10:09] husband all as well as what she told
[10:11] Ghazi and if I'm pronouncing that name
[10:13] wrong you forgive me and I'm just trying
[10:15] to do the best I can with what I got and
[10:19] and she she went and she fell down that
[10:22] Elijah's feet and and she said I'm not
[10:24] gonna leave you until you come to my
[10:26] house and and Elijah went and and and
[10:29] see Elijah a circuit searching for the
[10:31] will of God also he's searching for the
[10:34] correct approach he paces back and forth
[10:36] he prays and he's doing all these things
[10:38] and finally he lays himself down on that
[10:42] child and and he his body began to go
[10:44] warm and he lays himself down mouth to
[10:47] mouth head to head fingers two fingers
[10:50] at brother Brennan said it was like
[10:52] taking a prayer cloth and putting it on
[10:53] a sick person but you see brother
[10:55] Brennan explained that that that created
[10:57] a channel because the Word of God was in
[11:00] that man so much that the spirit of the
[11:03] of the Living God could pass from him
[11:05] into that dead child and raised him to
[11:08] life
[11:09] you see that's that's walking in the
[11:12] word that's walking in the will of God
[11:14] if we could find the will of God for our
[11:17] lives if we could find the plan of God
[11:19] for our lives he'll raise us rate we'll
[11:22] see God raised out of history will see
[11:25] God move us out of our dead ideas and
[11:29] our our old ideas our carnality into a
[11:32] living reality of a living God I believe
[11:34] that's what the will of God is because
[11:39] you see we we need to know the will of
[11:41] God it's important to know the will of
[11:44] God you know there's maybe maybe you
[11:46] could say two different kinds two
[11:49] different ways of looking at the will of
[11:51] God in Psalm chapter 33 it talks about
[11:55] what what I'll say like their
[11:57] determinant to the will of God it just
[11:59] lays out a plan that there
[12:01] gonna be oh say say like this there is
[12:03] gonna be a bride there's gonna be seven
[12:06] church ages there's gonna be somebody in
[12:09] each church age to receive the word to
[12:10] believe the word there is gonna be these
[12:12] things it's that God has determined it
[12:15] he said it's going to be in psalms
[12:18] chapter 33 verses 4 to 11 it says for
[12:20] the word of the Lord is right and all
[12:22] his works are done in truth he loveth
[12:25] righteousness and judgment the earth is
[12:27] full of the goodness of the Lord by the
[12:29] word of the Lord were the heavens made
[12:31] and all the host of him by the breath of
[12:33] his mouth in other words God spoke it
[12:36] and just it just it didn't matter
[12:38] whether or not you believe it or not God
[12:40] spoken and it came to pass he spoke it
[12:43] in the world was formed he just
[12:45] determined it he said it he said it and
[12:47] that's the way it is he gathered the
[12:49] waters of the sea together as and heat
[12:51] he layeth up the depth and storehouses
[12:53] and let all the earth fear the Lord let
[12:56] all the inhabitants of the world stand
[12:57] in awe of him for he spake and it was
[13:00] done he commanded and it stood fast the
[13:03] Lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen
[13:05] Denault he maketh the devices of the
[13:07] people of none effect the counsel of the
[13:09] Lord standard forever the thoughts of
[13:12] his heart to all generations in other
[13:14] words when God says that it's jun's it's
[13:17] going to happen now now at Curtin we
[13:19] want to get down to a more individual
[13:21] level because God God spoke it but yet
[13:24] there's there's there's things there's a
[13:26] an individual person a will of God for
[13:29] your life and and and that works a
[13:32] little bit in a different way because
[13:33] you can allow the will of God to take
[13:35] effect in your life and you can prevent
[13:37] it and and you see there's the will of
[13:39] God here that I want to talk about
[13:41] tonight and your self will as self will
[13:44] as opposed to the will of God what we
[13:46] want to do we want to let that self will
[13:49] die out and allow so that the will of
[13:51] God can take preeminence in our lives
[13:54] let me read another scripture before I
[13:56] kind of go on from from that line of
[13:58] thought and Daniel chapter 2 and this is
[13:59] one we quote so many times and yet it
[14:02] seems like we struggle with this we
[14:04] struggle with really accepting this
[14:07] Daniel answer that said be blessed be
[14:09] the name for of God forever and ever
[14:13] for wisdom and might are his and he
[14:16] changes the times and the seasons he
[14:18] removed with kings and setteth up Kings
[14:21] he giveth wisdom unto the wise and
[14:23] knowledge to them that no understanding
[14:26] another in other words that's God's
[14:27] deterministic will he just says I I'm
[14:30] gonna put in kingship whoever whoever I
[14:33] want to there's another scripture that
[14:35] I've forgotten right now that says that
[14:36] he he he convened the will the heart of
[14:39] the King whatever way he wants to he
[14:42] could make the King think this or think
[14:44] that because it's his will he's he's
[14:46] using as Martin Luther would say he's
[14:49] he's allowing the the government of the
[14:52] world to fulfill his law so that so that
[14:56] people are punished for doing wrong so
[14:58] that people are rewarded for doing good
[15:00] by putting in his deterministic will
[15:03] into the into the things of the world
[15:05] you say well well maybe what I want to
[15:09] get across tonight is it is a you know
[15:12] we think that we're influencing
[15:14] elections and things we think when we go
[15:16] to the poll and vote we're having this
[15:18] great big influence and everything but
[15:20] really God it's all up to God God put
[15:23] somebody in power so that his will can
[15:26] be fulfilled and you look at that who
[15:28] the President of the United States is
[15:30] and all these things and we worry so
[15:32] much about Republican or Democrat or
[15:33] whatever but yet the person that's in
[15:35] power is in power so that God's will can
[15:38] be fulfilled
[15:39] whether it's or not so that they can
[15:41] have a relationship with Israel and so
[15:42] that this can happen and that could
[15:44] happen and all these things it's so that
[15:46] God's will can be fulfilled and
[15:48] regardless of who's in power whether
[15:50] it's a Republican or whether it's a
[15:51] Democrat or whatever I might get in
[15:53] trouble for it but I'm not afraid of you
[15:55] tonight
[15:57] because you see it's all working
[16:00] according to God's plan and purpose it
[16:02] doesn't matter who's in power God is the
[16:04] one that put them in power it's God's
[16:07] deterministic wheel and you see but you
[16:09] see with you with your personal life his
[16:12] will works a little differently he's got
[16:15] it will for you he won't stings to
[16:17] happen in your life he wants you to be
[16:19] blessed he wants things to to take place
[16:21] but you are the one that prevents thing
[16:25] from happening you are the one that
[16:27] prevents God's blessings from happening
[16:29] in your life so there's two kind of ways
[16:31] of looking at will there's that global
[16:33] overarching view of will that God says
[16:36] there's gonna be seven church ages
[16:38] there's gonna be a bride but because
[16:40] there's going to be a bride doesn't
[16:41] necessarily mean that each individual in
[16:44] this church tonight is part of that it's
[16:46] up to you to be a part of that bride or
[16:48] not so if you pull up that definition of
[16:51] will in the Greek lexicon where the
[16:55] definition is what one wishes or has
[16:58] determined shall be done now you see God
[17:02] God is not he's not when we think of his
[17:05] will he's not surprised he's not
[17:08] surprised at who's gonna believe tonight
[17:09] he's not surprised he's got it all
[17:11] planned out he knows in advance who will
[17:14] believe and who will not he knows
[17:16] tonight who will be who will go from
[17:18] this church service and say well I
[17:19] didn't know I just slept the whole way
[17:21] through it I didn't really get anything
[17:23] from it he knows and every church
[17:25] service what what happened he knows he
[17:27] knows the complete plan of your life he
[17:29] knows the end from the beginning but he
[17:32] and all of that is part of his will
[17:34] because he's not surprised he knows
[17:37] what's going to happen and and if you're
[17:40] kind of getting into the spirit of the
[17:42] message tonight though the will of God
[17:44] let's be playing what I'm referring to
[17:46] the will of God is his word and his word
[17:49] is eternal and his word governs how
[17:52] things should be what will take place
[17:54] all of these different kind of things
[17:56] what what will the will for your life
[17:58] and God's will we think a lot of times
[18:01] when we're when we want to find the will
[18:02] of God that is somehow hidden that
[18:05] there's some kind of maybe something
[18:07] that we could we could maybe stumble
[18:09] over and stumble our way into the will
[18:11] of God or maybe we'll maybe we will cry
[18:14] and expect some lightning bolt to strike
[18:16] us or we don't realize I think how plain
[18:20] the will of God is if God is going to
[18:23] hold us responsible for the will of God
[18:26] that he will make it easy to find he
[18:29] will make it will make it away it will
[18:31] make a way for us to be able to get to
[18:33] it and so many times we
[18:35] in our minds we think that the will of
[18:37] God is some obscure thing that we can
[18:40] barely grab a hole to that that who
[18:43] knows the real will of God that maybe
[18:45] maybe some we almost spiritual eyes that
[18:48] so much so that maybe if we're maybe you
[18:51] know you going out of church and you
[18:53] stop at the gas station and you look and
[18:55] see what price the the gas that your
[18:58] pump it is and it might fall on a
[19:00] certain set of numbers and you
[19:01] well spiritual eyes that so much into
[19:03] maybe advising us on oh well I need to
[19:06] buy this house with this street number
[19:08] and I'm just kind of making making an
[19:09] example off-the-cuff but you see that's
[19:11] not how you find the will of God the
[19:14] will of God is very easy to find all you
[19:17] have to do is go home and open up the
[19:19] pages of your Bible and sit there in the
[19:21] quiet and and meditate upon the Word of
[19:24] God and the war and you will find the
[19:26] will of God the chart let's read John
[19:32] chapter 4 verses 31 to 34 and the
[19:36] meanwhile his disciples prayed him
[19:38] saying master II but he said to them I
[19:40] have meat to eat that you know not of
[19:42] therefore said it said the disciples one
[19:45] to another hath any man brought him all
[19:46] to eat jesus saith under then my meat is
[19:49] to do the will of him that sent me and
[19:52] to finish his work and you think well
[19:55] well that was that was for Jesus in
[19:57] Matthew chapter 7 21 verse 21 it says
[20:00] not everyone that saith unto me Lord
[20:02] Lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[20:04] heaven but he that doeth the will of my
[20:07] father which is in heaven so you see
[20:10] it's important to be able to do the will
[20:12] of the Lord how can you do the will of
[20:15] the Lord if you don't know what his will
[20:17] is it's very important to know what the
[20:20] will of the Lord is and and that's why
[20:22] I'm getting getting back to my point
[20:23] that hah you've got to be able to come
[20:25] to a church that can a communicate to
[20:28] you what the will of the Lord is the
[20:30] will of the Lord is a famine in the land
[20:32] for knowing what the will of the Lord is
[20:35] in Ephesians chapter 5 verses 15 and 17
[20:39] you see then that you walk circumspectly
[20:41] not as fool's but as wise redeeming the
[20:46] time because the days are evil
[20:48] for be not unwise but understanding what
[20:52] the will of the Lord is you should
[20:55] understand what the will of the Lord is
[20:58] and and again what the will of the Lord
[21:00] is as his word how can you know what to
[21:03] do how can you know how to behave
[21:05] yourself in the congregation of the Lord
[21:07] how can you know everything but from
[21:09] church order to how who you should marry
[21:11] and how you should conduct yourself at
[21:14] work and what you should even aspire to
[21:16] and your Christian journey how can you
[21:18] even know what you're doing here without
[21:21] knowing what the will of the Lord is
[21:23] Matthew chapter 12 verse 48 to 50 says
[21:27] but he answered and said unto him that
[21:28] told him who is my mother and who are my
[21:30] brethren and he stretched forth his hand
[21:32] toward his disciples and said Behold my
[21:35] mother and brethren for whosoever shall
[21:37] do the will of my father which is in
[21:39] heaven the same is my brother and sister
[21:42] and mother so he disconnected from
[21:44] himself are all kind of natural
[21:47] relations all in any kind of there's no
[21:50] genealogy in this there's no no kind of
[21:53] natural familial thing what it is to be
[21:55] - what he's saying is if you'll do the
[21:59] will if you'll understand the word and
[22:02] then perform the word by by knowing what
[22:06] the word requires for you by by seeking
[22:09] after those things then the same as my
[22:13] brother and sister my mother that's the
[22:14] same with my family members if you want
[22:17] to be part of the family of God
[22:18] understand what his will is and meet the
[22:22] requirements of the wheel in Amos
[22:27] chapter 8 I got to hit this - because
[22:29] you see that the little woman Elijah sit
[22:33] the little woman away because there was
[22:36] a famine coming in the land she sent her
[22:39] away for seven years and Amos chapter
[22:41] chapter 8 verse 11 says behold the days
[22:44] come saith the Lord God that I will send
[22:46] a famine in the land not a famine of
[22:49] bread not a thirst for water but of
[22:51] hearing the words of the Lord
[22:53] and I want to just point out that it's
[22:55] not a famine of the preaching of the
[22:57] word because the word is being preached
[22:59] the word is being preached all around
[23:01] the world of course there's false
[23:02] preachers and there's true preachers and
[23:04] everything but in between if you could
[23:06] say it like that there's all kinds of
[23:07] things being preached but yet the word
[23:10] is being preached and also we've got the
[23:12] word on an eleven hundred tapes that you
[23:14] can play in your car or whatever there
[23:16] is the word is available to you the will
[23:19] of God is available to you but you see
[23:21] there's a famine for the hearing of the
[23:23] word in the land because what happens is
[23:25] the people's eyes have become so close
[23:27] their eyes have become so covered and
[23:30] their ears are clogged up with their own
[23:33] self-will with the things that they've
[23:34] they think to be true that they cannot
[23:37] understand what the will of God is and
[23:40] so they're wandering about from in
[23:41] confusion wandering from church to
[23:44] church from place to place
[23:45] you know I'm riding on the subway to
[23:48] work you look around and you begin to
[23:50] think this whole the whole world is just
[23:53] wandering and confusion nobody knows
[23:55] what they're here for
[23:56] that's why people commit suicide and why
[23:59] they get depressed and all these things
[24:00] because they don't know the will and the
[24:03] purpose of God for their life they don't
[24:05] know what they're doing here for they
[24:07] think that it's just an endless vain
[24:12] journey that one day they'll fall into
[24:14] the grave and their whole life will be
[24:16] meaningless and and everything will just
[24:18] be black and there's nothing even beyond
[24:20] the grave they don't understand the
[24:21] purpose that we're living for but you
[24:23] see you are not ordained to live in
[24:26] confusion you are not ordained to wonder
[24:29] about without a plan and purpose of your
[24:31] life because you see God has a plan and
[24:33] purpose for every one sitting in here
[24:36] tonight if you can just find out what
[24:38] that plan and purpose is and the only
[24:40] way that you can find out what God's
[24:42] plan is for you tonight is to look into
[24:44] his will and look into his word and find
[24:47] out what God wants you to do you see so
[24:50] many people wonder about wondering if if
[24:52] church actually works how you're saved
[24:55] and wondering even if God loves you or
[24:57] not and I wanted that's one of the
[24:59] things I want to declare tonight
[25:01] that God's will is for you to understand
[25:03] that God's will is for you to know that
[25:06] God loves you that God has a purpose for
[25:08] you that you're just not on some vain
[25:11] journey listening to some vain fables
[25:13] some fables that some man cooked up
[25:16] we're not we haven't heard a message
[25:18] that originated from Jeffersonville
[25:20] we've heard a message that are
[25:22] originated from the throne of God on
[25:25] high we've we've heard a message that
[25:27] originated directly from glory and it's
[25:30] calling us back to glory
[25:31] so we're not wandering wandering a don't
[25:35] wonder tonight if you can be delivered
[25:37] if you can overcome tonight because God
[25:40] made a way for you to overcome the
[25:42] things of this world he's made a way for
[25:45] you to overcome yourself well he's made
[25:47] of waiting for you to deny yourself and
[25:49] to be a prisoner of the word because you
[25:52] see if you do not know his will then you
[25:55] are living in self-will you're living
[25:58] under the will of yourself or maybe
[26:01] under the will of others if you don't
[26:03] know the will of God you're just doing
[26:05] something because you've heard somebody
[26:07] else tell you to do it or somebody else
[26:09] is guiding you but if you have a
[26:11] personal revelation yourself of who
[26:13] Jesus Christ is and you know the word
[26:15] and you know the day in our living and
[26:17] you know what steps your life should
[26:20] take then you're living under his will
[26:23] you're living according to his will you
[26:26] see that's that's our great battle is
[26:28] the battle of self wheel versus his will
[26:32] and brother were never told us that we
[26:34] were we live in really three realms we
[26:36] live in these three modes we live in and
[26:38] in a realm of vision which you know I've
[26:43] never seen a vision and maybe most of
[26:45] most of us have never seen a vision but
[26:48] but there's another realm that you can
[26:49] live in the realm of Revelation and a
[26:52] revelation is when is when you know it
[26:55] to be true
[26:55] not somebody's not going to come along
[26:58] and say well I I maybe I can reason you
[27:00] out of believing that the message is
[27:03] true maybe I can tell you that that you
[27:05] know so many people did
[27:08] the count was off of how many people
[27:11] died and when the when the bridge was
[27:12] being built or some other nonsense like
[27:15] that but when you have a revelation
[27:16] because you understand the will of God
[27:19] nothing can move you from that the gates
[27:22] of Hell could not prevail against the
[27:24] revelation but then there's a third the
[27:26] third room the third move that we
[27:28] operate in almost all of the time and is
[27:30] that that is that humanistic real where
[27:33] we get tired we think when you know when
[27:36] you come to church and you get kind of
[27:38] you get sleepy or whatever that sleepy
[27:40] spirit will get on you and you begin to
[27:42] wonder maybe even wondering and within
[27:44] yourself within your mind what the
[27:46] preacher is preaching about and all
[27:48] those things you begin to wonder if the
[27:49] preacher is preaching on you it won't
[27:52] wanting to be treated differently it
[27:54] wanting to be treated nice or many
[27:57] sometimes even preachers they'll go to a
[27:58] particular church and they'll but get
[28:00] all upset within themselves why they
[28:02] don't get invited to preach and all that
[28:04] humanistic around wondering this and
[28:06] wondering that but if we can get out of
[28:08] that room and get into the realm of
[28:11] Revelation and the only way to do that
[28:14] to deny self will requires knowing and
[28:18] understanding the we love God that God's
[28:20] will is his word because I was I was
[28:26] just recently studying on the life of
[28:28] David and how he he's so put all of his
[28:32] trust in the will of God when when
[28:34] Samuel came and poured that anointing
[28:36] all over his head he knew that he was
[28:38] going to be king he knew that that was
[28:40] the will of God in his life and it
[28:42] didn't matter what Saul said or what
[28:44] Absalom said he walked in a perfect
[28:46] confidence it didn't even matter what
[28:48] David's own works were when he went with
[28:50] Bathsheba and did all these horrible
[28:52] things the will of God had already been
[28:55] spoken in his life and maybe that's
[28:57] another thing I want to communicate
[28:58] tonight is is God is able to - to
[29:02] overcome all of your faults and failings
[29:04] you know brother under said you'll never
[29:07] be an angel here or there but you are a
[29:09] human and God made you that way he made
[29:12] you
[29:13] in a way that that we would need a
[29:15] savior he made us in a way you're not
[29:18] we're we're not destined to walk around
[29:21] here like perfect like angels but God's
[29:24] work God already paid the price he paid
[29:26] the price when he died on the cross and
[29:28] it's not by your works that you'll be
[29:30] saved it buddies but it's by faith and
[29:33] they're overcoming power they overcome
[29:35] and work that Jesus already performed
[29:37] that will give us overcoming faith
[29:40] overcoming power in this day whether I'm
[29:45] said in in Revelation chapter 4 we're
[29:48] not just 61 he said yet Vail you know
[29:50] what that veil is that veil is your
[29:51] heart from it from will say from the
[29:54] will of God are you ready the veil is
[29:56] called self-will did you get that
[29:58] picture now the sense is out there the
[30:01] sense is on the body and the census to
[30:03] the soul and the veil between that in
[30:05] the holy place the holiest of holy and
[30:06] the only way that you can get in there
[30:09] is to have self will for whosoever what
[30:12] hosts whoever shakes hands whosoever is
[30:15] immersed whosoever joins the church
[30:17] whosoever passes his letter whosoever
[30:19] does what whosoever will come beyond the
[30:22] veil whosoever will come beyond that
[30:25] bale to to deny yourself well when you
[30:28] come to church and you hear things
[30:29] preached it that it just stumbles you
[30:31] into whatever go back to the Bible and
[30:33] look into the wheel of God's Word and
[30:35] hold it up to you like a mirror and say
[30:36] is it true or not and I believe that now
[30:40] is the hour we we should be concerned
[30:42] about what the wheel is maybe let me
[30:45] just stir up your remembrance turn you
[30:46] up a little bit to get real serious
[30:48] about the word because now the hour is
[30:51] growing late now is the time where
[30:53] people because they don't know the will
[30:55] of God had begun to fall off we're
[30:57] coming to a place where the church is
[30:59] holding up the bride is holding up and
[31:01] people are beginning to fall off because
[31:03] they're not steadying the word they
[31:05] don't know the will of God but that is
[31:07] not the so that is not so for you
[31:10] tonight because you
[31:11] you have been taught you have been
[31:13] instructed in the will of God
[31:15] you're not predestinated to just be
[31:17] wondering what's going on what's
[31:18] wondering what's happening you see
[31:21] brother ramen and in that perseverance
[31:24] he said and that Avenue is the same
[31:26] place that God said every man from Adam
[31:28] and Eve self will you will to live or
[31:31] you will to die either one you won't -
[31:34] is your based on free moral agency and
[31:36] whatever a spirit that you let dominate
[31:39] you will bring forth the fruits your
[31:41] life will be dominated by the inside you
[31:44] are the one that allows either the
[31:46] spirit of truth or the spirit of the
[31:48] world to dominate you you are the one
[31:50] that allows that and you allow it by
[31:53] what you feed on when you sit in your
[31:55] car and you listen to rap music you
[31:57] listen to the junk of the world and you
[31:58] listen to all these talk shows and all
[32:00] the soap operas and all that nonsense
[32:02] that is allowing that spirit of the
[32:04] world to dominate you it is allowing
[32:06] that thing that those things those
[32:08] influences to dominate your life and it
[32:10] will influence the way you talk and the
[32:12] way you act and the way you speak but if
[32:14] you allow the will of God the Word of
[32:16] God to dominate your life it will
[32:18] influence the way you act and the way
[32:20] you talk and the way you respond to
[32:21] others it will cause a change in your
[32:23] life it will give you overcoming power
[32:25] because this is not just this is not the
[32:28] words that of a man that we've heard
[32:30] we're not going just going to message
[32:31] school but this is the words of God that
[32:33] we are that we are hearing and the Word
[32:35] of God will not return to Him void the
[32:38] world of God will perform what it was
[32:40] sent to do brother Brennan the message
[32:44] thirst he said like Paul said describes
[32:46] in Romans chapter seven verse 21 when I
[32:48] would do good then evil is nigh when you
[32:51] try when you try ever have that in
[32:54] experienced Christians that when you're
[32:56] trying to do something that's worthwhile
[32:58] go to make an effort to do something
[33:00] that's good then you find out that there
[33:02] is the devil on every hand just to upset
[33:03] you everything and that's one good thing
[33:06] that I'd like to say this that the
[33:07] Christians might know that when you're
[33:08] when you're starting to do something and
[33:11] there is all something always trying to
[33:13] upset you and doing it do it anyhow
[33:14] that's the devil they're trying to keep
[33:16] you from doing it now many times I meet
[33:19] people that's prone to be a little
[33:20] nervous
[33:21] when they find out that they're trying
[33:23] to do something and everything
[33:24] just blocking it off on both sides they
[33:26] say it not might not been the will of
[33:28] the Lord see now don't let the devil lie
[33:31] to you like that the first thing is find
[33:35] out whether it's the will of God or not
[33:37] and then if you want to know whether
[33:40] it's the will of God here now here's the
[33:43] clincher of the whole thing if you want
[33:45] to find out whether it's the will of God
[33:46] or not look in the Bible
[33:49] look into the Bible now you dare you've
[33:51] got a quote it's not just brother Bob
[33:53] saying this listen if you want to find
[33:55] out if the person that you're talking to
[33:57] you is the right kind of a mate for your
[33:59] life look in the Bible if you want to
[34:01] find out if you're wearing the right
[34:02] kind of clothes look in the Bible if you
[34:05] want to find out whether the job that
[34:06] you're looking for is okay for you to
[34:08] work there because they work on Sunday
[34:10] and work on Wednesdays and all those
[34:12] kind of things look in the Bible if you
[34:14] want to find out how to raise your
[34:16] family look in the Bible and the Bible
[34:18] will tell you if you want to find out
[34:19] the will of God for your life look in
[34:22] the Bible if you want to find out the
[34:24] will of God for the whole bride of the
[34:25] age look in the Bible the Bible is the
[34:28] will of God if you want to if you want
[34:30] to find out how to live and how to do
[34:32] and look in the Bible and then if you
[34:34] want to know whether it's the will of
[34:35] God look into the Bible there is the
[34:37] thing that sets you straight is the Word
[34:39] of God and then if you see us in the
[34:41] Word of God for you to do it like for
[34:44] instance seeking for the baptism of the
[34:46] Holy Ghost many times I've run into
[34:48] people say well I have salt for the Holy
[34:49] Ghost and I just couldn't receive it I
[34:52] don't believe it's for me every time I
[34:55] get down I get sick and I go to praying
[34:58] if I fast I get sick and if I try to
[35:00] stay all night I stay up I get so sleepy
[35:02] I can't get off my feet remember that is
[35:05] the devil because God intends for you to
[35:10] have the holy spirit it's for who soever
[35:13] will many times you find when you're
[35:17] prayed in a meeting for divine healing
[35:19] then the next day you find out no doubt
[35:20] that the devil will make that twice as
[35:22] bad as it was the day before see
[35:24] remember that's just Satan trying to get
[35:26] you away from the blessing that God has
[35:28] got for you see don't you listen to that
[35:30] fellow see always press right on you
[35:33] what he's talking about here in this
[35:35] quote is when you're trying to obey the
[35:37] will of God when you find out what God
[35:38] wants you to do like get the Holy Ghost
[35:41] be born again then the devil is gonna
[35:44] attack you and he's gonna tell you it's
[35:45] not for you and all those kind of things
[35:47] but the the ammunition against the devil
[35:49] is the will of God which is the Word of
[35:52] God throw the will of God in the devil's
[35:55] face whenever he tries to tell you that
[35:56] that experience you had years ago it's
[35:58] not true that the thing that the things
[36:00] that God has shown you are not through
[36:02] throw throw that will of God back in his
[36:04] face face and that that will give you
[36:06] faith because as you confess the Word of
[36:09] God as you go through your life as you
[36:11] go through this journey
[36:12] God is molding your confession so that
[36:15] you'll say the right thing so that it
[36:17] gets hold down he's molding your
[36:19] confession so that you know exactly what
[36:21] to the do to the devil so that when the
[36:23] devil comes and says that I don't know
[36:25] about that I don't know if this message
[36:27] that's true I don't know if the Bible is
[36:29] true then you know how to attack him and
[36:32] I believe one thing that you can throw
[36:34] back in the devil's face when he comes
[36:36] and tells you that message is not true
[36:38] there's this story that I'm reading the
[36:39] night in 2nd Kings chapter 8 because
[36:41] there was a woman that after seven years
[36:43] she came out and everything was restored
[36:45] unto her and the same thing is happening
[36:47] to the bride after seven years traveling
[36:49] traveling around she's come back and
[36:51] she's crying to the king I know what I'm
[36:54] supposed to have everything is supposed
[36:56] to be restored to me because listen that
[36:59] woman knew the will of God that you're
[37:01] supposed to know the will of God you're
[37:03] supposed to know what you're doing here
[37:05] tonight you're supposed to have an
[37:06] understanding of what what what place in
[37:08] what position you have because God's
[37:11] will is his word that shooter might
[37:15] woman she believed for a child and it
[37:18] was raised from the dead and she trusted
[37:21] God to go down into the enemy's land to
[37:23] preserve her during the famine and she
[37:25] came out the other side she came out and
[37:28] she was because she was walking in the
[37:31] will of God God's will is her word and
[37:34] she back then and in her particular
[37:37] instance maybe she didn't have a
[37:38] loose-leaf Bible to page through but
[37:41] she had was the Word of God manifested a
[37:44] prophet that told her go here and do
[37:46] this and she clung to that prophets
[37:48] words she clung to his words and did
[37:50] exactly as she was bidden until the end
[37:53] of the story when she come out of that
[37:55] seven years that it came time for her to
[37:57] go into the land you see III I'm getting
[38:01] ahead of myself but see the shooter
[38:04] might woman was promised a child think
[38:10] about it think about another another
[38:12] woman in the Bible that was promised a
[38:13] child that was promised a child that was
[38:16] relying and trusting on the will of God
[38:18] and then got out of that will of God I'm
[38:20] speaking of Eve because you see Eve Eve
[38:23] wanted to know the will of God by
[38:25] getting ahead of God's program she
[38:28] wanted to know the will of God she was
[38:30] it was very mysterious how things were
[38:32] going to take place in her life the
[38:34] Bible says in Genesis chapter 1 verses
[38:36] 26 and 27 that that God had told them be
[38:39] fruitful and multiply and replenish the
[38:42] earth and subdue it he told them what
[38:44] the will of God was for her life and so
[38:46] they had the will of God but she was
[38:48] wondering maybe what how it would be
[38:50] accomplished and and and day after day
[38:53] went by and she didn't see anything
[38:55] happening and then the devil came down
[38:57] and God and the Beast and began to plan
[38:59] some new ideas in her mind you see how
[39:01] slick the devil and shrewd that 'evil is
[39:04] and the devil is doing the same thing
[39:06] today people sitting in message churches
[39:08] and they began to think day by day that
[39:11] I don't see maybe anything happening not
[39:14] realizing how God's will is supposed to
[39:17] work in your life you don't want your
[39:19] pot for it to boil you don't go look at
[39:21] the seed and and say what every day you
[39:24] go to look at it again but you just keep
[39:26] plant that seed and planting good ground
[39:29] and just keep watering it and by-and-by
[39:31] it'll come up so Eve Eve got out from
[39:35] the womb from under the will of God by
[39:37] trying to cheat she tried to get ahead
[39:39] of God's program she began to lose trust
[39:42] lose confidence and Adam and her husband
[39:44] she began to lose trust I'll say in the
[39:47] ministry she began to think well maybe
[39:49] the ministry doesn't know what they're
[39:51] talking about maybe there's enough
[39:53] Avenue that I can go to get to get the
[39:56] the will of God in my life
[39:58] her purpose you see was to bring forth
[40:00] life by the spoken word but it had not
[40:03] been made manifest and not been made
[40:06] real to her yet and our purpose you see
[40:08] was to have total dominion over the
[40:11] earth let's go back and read Genesis
[40:13] 1:27 27 or 28 again God created man in
[40:17] his own image and the image of God
[40:20] created he him male and female created
[40:23] he them and God blessed him and said to
[40:24] them be fruitful and multiply and
[40:28] replenish the earth and subdue it and
[40:31] have dominion dominion over the fish of
[40:36] the sea and over the fowl of the air and
[40:38] over every living thing over every
[40:42] living thing that moveth upon the earth
[40:44] Eva was predestinated to have dominion
[40:48] over the earth and you were
[40:50] predestinated not to cow down to the
[40:52] devil but they have authority over the
[40:54] devil not because of your own ideas of
[40:57] your own self will but because you know
[40:59] the will of God because the will of God
[41:02] is made manifest in you and you know how
[41:05] to react to the will to the to the lies
[41:06] of the devil your plan and purpose God
[41:09] has ordained you to be an authority to
[41:12] have complete dominion over the earth to
[41:14] have dominion over your flesh to have
[41:16] dominion over yourself wheel to have
[41:18] Dominion and authority over the little
[41:20] things that used to bother you the lust
[41:22] of the flesh and the pride of life and
[41:24] all these things God has raised you up
[41:26] to have dominion over these things this
[41:29] is what the bride has been called for
[41:31] and you see Eve was called to those
[41:33] things to have complete dominion over
[41:35] the earth but yet she was she was
[41:37] promised a child he see just like this
[41:40] shunammite woman was promised a child
[41:42] but she got out from under the will of
[41:44] God the will of you think about that
[41:46] what the will of God the will of God for
[41:48] Adam and Eve many of those things are
[41:50] the same thing for them for us we see
[41:52] the will of God for Adam was not to be
[41:55] alone the will of God for Adam was not
[41:58] to go through life alone and God doesn't
[42:01] want that for you and I you see he
[42:03] doesn't want us to just be alone as we
[42:05] go through life he wants you
[42:07] he wants you to come to church and go
[42:09] through this spiritual journey with
[42:10] other people he wants you to fellowship
[42:12] with other people even when Jesus sent
[42:14] the preachers out to go preach in the
[42:15] street he didn't send him alone he sent
[42:17] them two by two he said don't go alone
[42:19] but take somebody with you because he
[42:21] doesn't want you to be alone he wants to
[42:23] he wants you to have a helpmeet he wants
[42:25] you to have other brothers and sisters
[42:27] to fellowship with he wants you to have
[42:30] like in Proverbs where iron sharpens
[42:32] iron that where other brothers were
[42:33] always quoting here in church iron
[42:35] sharpens iron we sharpen one another and
[42:38] when you go off alone and you don't
[42:39] fellowship with other I believe that you
[42:42] in that part of the world of God you are
[42:44] outside of the will of God because you
[42:46] were not meant to be alone you are not
[42:48] meant to be isolated but you're supposed
[42:50] to be supposed to be part of something
[42:53] part of a great organism a great moving
[42:55] of God the Bride of Christ the will of
[42:58] God for Adam and Eve with to control
[43:00] nature and to fulfill the Word of God to
[43:03] see the Word of God fulfilled in their
[43:05] members the word the will of God for
[43:08] Adam and Eve was not for them to be
[43:10] constantly coughing and sick and and and
[43:13] dealing with all these health problems
[43:15] of things but the will of God was for
[43:17] them to be healthy and that's the will
[43:19] of God for you tonight if you can just
[43:21] believe that it the will of God is for
[43:23] you to be healed God wants you to be
[43:26] healed and he wants you to be well he
[43:28] doesn't want you to be suffering in
[43:29] depression with a big old dark cloud
[43:31] over you going around wondering if why
[43:33] you're so anxious and everything he
[43:35] doesn't want you to have anxiety because
[43:37] the Bible says to fear not taking no
[43:40] thought for the morrow he wants you to
[43:43] be to have peace and comfort and all
[43:45] those things he wants you to have joy
[43:47] unspeakable he wants you to to be able
[43:51] to to bring forth life and Adam and Eve
[43:54] they were predestined to bring forth
[43:56] life and the bride is bringing forth
[43:58] life also bother spoken word because
[44:01] she's predestined to do the greater
[44:02] works to speak the world of life into
[44:05] the heart of the unbeliever and they
[44:07] hear the word and they become a believer
[44:09] because when you hear the word you are
[44:11] hearing from your theophany you're
[44:14] hearing from the eternal and that bursts
[44:16] the eternal life and you you were
[44:18] predestinated that's
[44:19] the will of God for your life the will
[44:22] of God you see is who God is how to
[44:25] serve God how to live what you're doing
[44:27] here what you should be interested in
[44:29] who to marry whether you should go to
[44:31] church or not your place is a Christian
[44:34] of what God wants you to be all those
[44:36] things are wrapped up and we're and in
[44:38] the will of God everybody doing all
[44:44] right
[44:49] better gonna sit in one in the median
[44:51] let me give you a shocky something he
[44:54] said see not all that saith unto me Lord
[44:57] Lord will enter in but the one that
[44:59] doeth the will of my father his will is
[45:01] his word we can be ever so religious
[45:03] have great time shouting jumping in
[45:06] these meetings which were I don't want
[45:08] to be critical but I have a duty to do
[45:11] to God and that Duty is to be sincere
[45:14] and to say what he wants me to say and
[45:16] I'm certainly grateful for the
[45:17] California chapter who was born with me
[45:20] and my convictions in other words he's
[45:22] saying it's great if you jump and shout
[45:24] in all those things and it's there's
[45:26] nothing wrong with that and many times
[45:28] when you catch a hold to the revelation
[45:30] of the of who you are and what God is
[45:32] doing for you that he can save you from
[45:34] your sins and all of those things you
[45:36] will jump and shout but but the main
[45:37] thing is do you do you know the will of
[45:41] God for your life have you caught the
[45:44] will of God have you caught the purpose
[45:46] and plan of God and his will is his word
[45:48] and the choosing of a bride brother Evan
[45:50] said the true Church of Christ the bride
[45:53] is so sold out to him and his promised
[45:55] word till the very mind that's in Christ
[45:58] is in you what a different and we find
[46:01] today that the modern church a modern
[46:04] world Church the modern world Church and
[46:07] also that the spiritual church are both
[46:09] pregnant to give birth to sons and we'll
[46:13] skip on down the the other is pregnant
[46:14] by the Word of God and in paragraph 170
[46:17] and will bring forth a body the finished
[46:19] body of Jesus Christ which is the bride
[46:21] that the body of Christ is and finished
[46:23] it and then skip keep skipping on down
[46:25] to the red now she the true bride so
[46:28] sold out to him that she used no mind of
[46:31] her own his mind of
[46:33] is his will and his will is his word so
[46:37] do you see what happens when you receive
[46:39] the word you are actually partaking in
[46:42] the mind of Christ and it is
[46:44] transforming your mind it is
[46:47] transforming your mind so that you
[46:49] understand his will so that you think
[46:51] like him so that you act like him so
[46:54] that he behave like him it is important
[46:57] to understand the will of God you see
[47:01] God's will God's will let's let's start
[47:04] out kind of basic for a second and work
[47:07] our way up God's will is for you to be
[47:11] saved and John chapter 3 it says as
[47:14] Moses lifted up the serpent in the
[47:15] wilderness even so must the Son of Man
[47:17] be lifted up that whosoever believed in
[47:19] him should not perish but have eternal
[47:21] life for God so loved the world that He
[47:23] gave His only begotten Son that
[47:24] whosoever believeth in him should not
[47:26] perish whosoever in other words this
[47:29] gets it's an open invitation to
[47:31] whosoever will the will of God is
[47:34] whoever will come can be saved and first
[47:37] Timothy 4 this is good and acceptable in
[47:39] the sight of God our Savior who will
[47:41] have all men to be saved and to come
[47:43] under the knowledge of the truth think
[47:46] about that that God wants everybody to
[47:48] be saved who will have all men to be
[47:50] saved
[47:51] God wants every single person in here
[47:53] tonight to be saved the only thing that
[47:55] it's preventing that is your own
[47:56] self-will your own inability to open up
[47:59] the door of your heart and just to let
[48:01] him in it's not by your crying and
[48:04] praying and all these other things
[48:05] that's as simple as whosoever will
[48:07] believe whosoever will accept the Word
[48:10] of God for your day whosoever will just
[48:13] believe it will be saved and the
[48:15] invitation is open you see you see
[48:18] that's that's kind of starting from the
[48:20] basic in but but now we're going to get
[48:22] up to the will of God for this day in
[48:27] Romans chapter 8 verse 26 when you see
[48:30] that God's will God's will for the bride
[48:32] in this day is to be conformed to the
[48:35] image of his son the will of God and
[48:39] that's what I was alluding to earlier
[48:41] and maybe I'm wrong I'll take correction
[48:44] but I I don't believe
[48:46] that the denominational world
[48:48] understands this part of the word of God
[48:50] they do not understand that the will of
[48:52] God in this day is for the life of God
[48:56] to be made manifest in a bride for him
[48:58] to reveal himself into a bride until she
[49:01] becomes the Living Word made manifest
[49:03] the walking word so much that it is
[49:07] actually God made manifest in a people
[49:09] walking and living doing the same works
[49:12] acting the same way thinking the same
[49:15] way obeying the word just like Jesus did
[49:18] in Romans chapter 8 verse 26 to 31 it
[49:21] says likewise the spirit also helpeth
[49:23] our infirmities for we know not what we
[49:26] should pray for as we ought but the
[49:27] spirit itself maketh intercession for us
[49:30] with groanings which cannot be uttered
[49:32] and what's it groaning for listen listen
[49:35] to this and he that searcheth the hearts
[49:37] knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit
[49:40] because he maketh intercession for the
[49:43] Saints according to the will of God in
[49:47] other words a calling to the Word of God
[49:49] and we know that all things work
[49:51] together for good to them that love God
[49:53] to them who are the called according to
[49:55] his purpose because they are walking in
[49:58] the will of God and it doesn't matter
[50:01] that this is what confuses people many
[50:03] times as you see Peter hanging upside
[50:05] down on the cross and you'll say well he
[50:07] must have been outside of the will of
[50:08] God you'll see Jesus died on the cross
[50:11] and you'll say well he must have been
[50:12] outside of the will of God but they were
[50:14] walking absolutely in the perfect will
[50:16] of God
[50:17] walking in the will of God does not mean
[50:19] that it will be a flowery bed of roses
[50:21] sometimes that will be persecution and
[50:24] hard times and died on the crosses and
[50:26] dying out to yourself will and
[50:28] struggling through life and all those
[50:30] things but when you're walking in the
[50:32] will of God you're walking into plan and
[50:34] purpose that God has for you and and
[50:38] think about think about the grace that
[50:41] God has shown us in this hour to be able
[50:44] to make manifest His Word in our lives
[50:46] to fulfill his word and to have
[50:48] confidence then when we leave this world
[50:50] we're going to a place where we will
[50:52] abide and rest eternally and you can
[50:54] have that too because that's an open
[50:56] invitation whosoever will let him come
[50:59] and rent the Book of Revelations the
[51:00] spirit and the bride both say the Botes
[51:03] say come whosoever come will come the
[51:07] the invitation is open all you have to
[51:09] do is believe let's see God's will is
[51:12] for you to be saved
[51:13] God's will is for you to make manifest
[51:15] his word that God's will is for you to
[51:17] overcome the the Holy Spirit the Holy
[51:24] Ghost was not given for you to just be
[51:26] able to cower down to the devil and just
[51:28] to let him run all over you
[51:29] but it was given for you to overcome the
[51:31] flood the flesh the lust of the flesh
[51:33] and all of those different things
[51:34] because you see you weren't
[51:36] predestinated to conform to the world
[51:39] you were predestinated - you are not
[51:41] predestinated to be under the power well
[51:43] we're just saying openly you will not be
[51:45] under for less than to be under the
[51:46] power of pornography to sit there and
[51:49] have that spirit over you and there's a
[51:51] sit in front of the computer and look at
[51:53] the lust of the flesh and sit and be be
[51:56] under the power of the Dominion of that
[51:57] you are not predestinated to be under
[51:59] the power of cigars and smoking and all
[52:02] that kind of stuff
[52:03] you are not predestinated to be that to
[52:05] be under that power the influence of
[52:07] that other things of this world under
[52:09] the influence of the worldwide web where
[52:12] you get sucked in that web that it's
[52:14] nares so many people into that under all
[52:17] that stuff under all that condemnation
[52:19] that just eating on that what feeding on
[52:22] that will cause your life to degrade in
[52:24] under the influence of the world and you
[52:27] were not called to be under the
[52:29] influence of drug addiction you were not
[52:31] called to set aside a little money every
[52:33] month for you for your marijuana
[52:34] addiction settle down a little money
[52:37] every month so you could go and and
[52:38] fulfill all of those lusts of the flesh
[52:40] and things like that you are not
[52:42] predestinated to be to be under the
[52:44] influence of the worldly Dominion
[52:47] to be under the power of of enmity and
[52:50] hatred and anxiety and depression and
[52:52] complexes to be under the power of a
[52:54] loveless marriage or godless home to be
[52:57] under the power of all the sin but God
[52:59] has given you the power to overcome and
[53:01] the power to overcome is too too loose
[53:05] to deny your own will and open up your
[53:08] heart to the will of God which is his
[53:11] word you cannot you cannot overcome your
[53:14] self wheel and the things of this world
[53:16] any other way but by eating on the world
[53:19] of eating on the Tree of Life eating on
[53:22] that wheel of God you cannot overcome by
[53:24] your own works by your own struggling
[53:27] and striving the only way that you can
[53:30] overcome is by the Word of God you will
[53:33] eat your way to overcoming your eating
[53:36] we're eating our way to overcoming the
[53:38] things of this world I think so many
[53:43] times it's so difficult for us to accept
[53:45] that that you are not saved when we come
[53:48] to church so many people in this message
[53:50] today think that the message is full of
[53:52] legalism and the rules and thing rules
[53:54] about how to dress and rules about how
[53:56] to behave and we can't do this we can't
[53:58] drink alcohol we can't go to the movies
[54:00] we can't do the all those things that's
[54:02] not what the message is about and I will
[54:04] say out to you on the internet that's
[54:05] not with a message about whoever is
[54:07] listening the message about R is about
[54:09] receiving the Word of God so that God
[54:11] can change you from the inside and that
[54:14] will cause a transformation in your life
[54:17] and you will know then by knowing the
[54:20] will of God for your life how to act and
[54:22] how to dress and it won't be you
[54:24] thinking on how you should act and then
[54:26] doing that but it will be an automatic
[54:28] process an automatic process when
[54:31] somebody slaps you in the face and an
[54:33] automatic response that you don't turn
[54:35] around and slap them back because the
[54:38] transformation has been from the inside
[54:40] out not from the outside in we're not
[54:44] serving a God that requires us to work
[54:46] and to do all these things and the labor
[54:48] in our self and to push a penny with our
[54:50] nose like the Catholics and to do all
[54:52] these all these things to do all these
[54:54] works this is a worthless religion that
[54:58] we believe it is not us doing work
[55:00] but it is God performing the work in us
[55:03] it's God doing the work not us doing the
[55:06] work he is performing the work he is the
[55:09] one that justified us he is the one that
[55:12] sanctified us he's the one that filled
[55:14] us with the Holy Ghost and we had
[55:16] nothing to do in it at all except for
[55:19] opening the door of our heart and see
[55:21] come me and I'll accept you it is not us
[55:24] doing it it is not my works that we are
[55:28] saved it is not our works that justifies
[55:31] our flesh is not justified by our works
[55:35] that's carnality to think that there's
[55:39] anything good that we can do in
[55:41] ourselves to think that there's anything
[55:43] good that we can do at all that would
[55:45] save us we needed a savior to come and
[55:48] die on the cross for us we needed a
[55:50] redeemer to come and die to pay the
[55:52] price and that price paid the price come
[55:55] that when that price was paying it paid
[55:58] it completely there is nothing else that
[56:01] you have to do all you have to do is
[56:04] believe that he paid the price he paid
[56:08] the price and then he gives you the
[56:10] token that the price has been paid and
[56:12] all you have to do is say I know I
[56:14] believe that the price has been paid the
[56:17] price has been paid and that token gives
[56:19] you the right to get on the train to get
[56:21] on the flight home it gives you the
[56:23] right to get back to get on the end and
[56:28] the channel of God's will for your life
[56:30] there is nothing else required that the
[56:34] other than that you believe it
[56:37] but God believing it will give you
[56:39] overcoming power it will give you power
[56:42] to overcome the flesh it will you give
[56:45] you power to overcome your spirit it
[56:47] will give you power and that's why when
[56:50] you get amongst believers you'll see
[56:51] believers acting different than the
[56:53] world behaving different from the world
[56:56] and you might be confused to look on
[56:58] that like they have a set of rules they
[56:59] have to do it that way but it's not a
[57:02] set of rules that sort of law what God
[57:04] has written his word on the tables of
[57:06] your heart and you automatically act
[57:09] that way you automatically behave that
[57:11] way because God is
[57:13] on the inside that's when you know it's
[57:15] real is when you're not putting on when
[57:17] you're not showing off you're not trying
[57:18] to impress nobody but you're just being
[57:21] genuine I like people to be genuine if
[57:23] you have a temper just be genuine if you
[57:26] have a little if you have a little
[57:27] railroad rage you never now just be
[57:29] genuine and when God overtakes that road
[57:32] rage one day then it'll be a genuine
[57:35] overcoming and everybody know that it's
[57:37] been God that overcame in you and it's
[57:39] not something that you just worked up in
[57:41] yourself but God conquered that thing in
[57:43] you I believe in being genuine not just
[57:46] hypocritical but being a real genuine be
[57:49] a real genuine unbeliever if you're
[57:51] gonna be a real genuine unbeliever and
[57:53] then when you're a believer you can be a
[57:54] real genuine believer be a real genuine
[57:58] thing whatever you are brother Graham
[58:07] said there's a part of me in church age
[58:08] she said the bride has the mind of
[58:13] Christ for she knows what he wants done
[58:14] with the word she performs the command
[58:17] of the word and his name for she has
[58:19] thus sayeth the Lord within the word is
[58:22] quickened by the Spirit and it comes to
[58:25] pass but you think about how if you know
[58:28] the will of God and you speak it by
[58:34] faith knowing and understanding the will
[58:37] of God it will come to pass the spoken
[58:41] word was the original seed and the
[58:43] spoken word of God has to come to pass
[58:46] and when you speak about faith it has to
[58:49] come to pass but I'm sitting like a seed
[58:51] that is planted and watered it comes to
[58:55] full harvest serving its purpose and he
[58:59] continues on those in the bride do only
[59:01] his will think about that the bride does
[59:05] only his will no one can make them do
[59:08] otherwise they have thus saith the Lord
[59:11] or that keep still they know that it has
[59:15] to be God in them doing the works it's
[59:17] not you doing the works but that should
[59:20] make everybody just shout even if you're
[59:22] just on the inside it's not you doing
[59:24] the works it's God on the
[59:26] Sode performing his will in you he is
[59:29] the one doing his works he said
[59:32] fulfilling his own word he did not
[59:35] complete all his work while in his
[59:37] earthly ministry so now he works in and
[59:42] through the bride he's performing his
[59:45] works in you to fulfill his will by
[59:48] revealing his will to you let's keep
[59:51] reading this story in second Kings
[59:53] chapter 8 verse 3 it says and it came to
[59:56] pass at the seven years in that the
[59:59] woman returned out of the land of the
[1:00:02] Philistines and she went forth to cry
[1:00:05] unto the King for her house for her land
[1:00:08] so now she's coming out after seven
[1:00:11] years she's coming out she's coming out
[1:00:16] and she knows now what she's here for
[1:00:21] she's got to see the land that she was
[1:00:25] given that she left when she went into
[1:00:27] the land of the Philistines is hers by
[1:00:30] right because it was given to her family
[1:00:33] by Joshua when they came over the Red
[1:00:35] Sea
[1:00:36] that is her family's inheritance it
[1:00:38] belongs to her and now she knows what
[1:00:42] rights she has that land is the land
[1:00:45] worth that Bette bore fruit for her
[1:00:47] family that land that land in this land
[1:00:51] to you this land to you is the promise
[1:00:54] of overcoming power it's the promise of
[1:00:56] the seals being open to you it's the
[1:00:58] promise of a revelation of the body
[1:01:00] change how to take a body change and you
[1:01:03] have a right to this if you know the
[1:01:05] will of God you have a right to this
[1:01:07] because God has given it to you not
[1:01:09] because of anything that you have done
[1:01:11] because of what he has done and he's
[1:01:13] giving it to you and it's your right and
[1:01:16] you can claim it you can claim it by
[1:01:18] looking into the word and seeing what
[1:01:20] God has given it to given unto you but
[1:01:23] you see it's got to be by revelation
[1:01:25] there's so many times we'll say well we
[1:01:28] can read in the word when it says thus
[1:01:30] and thus and such and such but that when
[1:01:32] the word is revealed to you
[1:01:35] reveals to you not only the word not
[1:01:37] only the true meaning but what to do
[1:01:40] with it that's why the preaching of the
[1:01:42] word is not just sticking up behind the
[1:01:44] pulpit and say the word but the
[1:01:46] preaching of the word is how to swing
[1:01:48] the sword you know you think about it
[1:01:51] somebody were to come into a church and
[1:01:52] and just be new and not understand
[1:01:55] things you wouldn't want to just chop
[1:01:57] their head off if somebody's coming into
[1:01:59] a church with depression and anxiety you
[1:02:01] wouldn't want to just heat more coals of
[1:02:04] fire on the head but you would want to
[1:02:06] swing that sword with wisdom and the
[1:02:08] same thing and every believers life when
[1:02:10] God gives you a revelation of his word
[1:02:12] he's not just giving you the correct
[1:02:14] interpretation but he's giving you
[1:02:16] knowledge and wisdom of how what to do
[1:02:18] with it went it like brother Branham
[1:02:20] when he was speaking and those people
[1:02:22] does that couple was out there kissing
[1:02:24] and doing all those things and they
[1:02:25] artists he had wisdom and knowledge of
[1:02:28] the correct thing to do when the word
[1:02:30] not just to swing that sword and lock
[1:02:33] their heads off but but to forgive
[1:02:36] because God had given him wisdom of what
[1:02:38] to do with the word we've got the word
[1:02:42] but do we have a revelation of the word
[1:02:44] and I believe that's what we should be
[1:02:45] crying out for and seeking a revelation
[1:02:48] of the word how do you get a revelation
[1:02:49] of the word the revelation of the word
[1:02:51] comes by the word because what the word
[1:02:54] on top of the word well it will water
[1:02:57] itself it will bring forth the word you
[1:03:01] see and I've got all these all these
[1:03:03] stories of y'all starting to get sleepy
[1:03:06] on me hang in there now we're in the
[1:03:09] homestretch at first Kings chapter 22
[1:03:13] there's a story of the king of Israel
[1:03:15] when he said they went down and the king
[1:03:18] of Israel said unto his servants are
[1:03:21] y'all all right in the back y'all lose
[1:03:23] me first Kings chapter 22 verse 3 all
[1:03:32] right
[1:03:34] first scheme chapter 22 verse 3 tells a
[1:03:37] story over the king of Israel these two
[1:03:40] kings they knew that the land and
[1:03:42] ramoth-gilead was theirs but they went
[1:03:45] to go get it without without a
[1:03:47] revelation of how they should go get it
[1:03:49] you see the revelant that the land was
[1:03:51] theirs it was a biblical promise that
[1:03:53] the land was theirs but they they didn't
[1:03:55] do it by a revelation when it says in
[1:03:59] the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the
[1:04:01] king of Judah said he's on his throne
[1:04:02] having put on their robes and the story
[1:04:05] goes that said Zedekiah the son of Qin
[1:04:07] tena Ana made him horns of iron and he
[1:04:10] said thus saith the Lord with these
[1:04:11] shalt thou push-push the Syrians until I
[1:04:14] have consumed them he was a he was a
[1:04:16] preacher preaching the literal that the
[1:04:19] literal text off of the page the word it
[1:04:22] was actually scriptural what he was
[1:04:24] saying that ramoth-gilead was theirs it
[1:04:27] was it was their land but they didn't do
[1:04:29] they didn't go get it
[1:04:31] by revelation because there was a little
[1:04:33] prophet that came on the scene and he
[1:04:34] said Micah I saw all Israel scattered
[1:04:38] upon the hills a sheep that have not a
[1:04:40] shepherd and the Lord said these have no
[1:04:43] master let them return every man to his
[1:04:46] house in peace you see you see what I'm
[1:04:49] getting at tonight is that we must have
[1:04:51] a revelation of the word to know the
[1:04:53] will of God for our day
[1:04:55] understanding understanding that that
[1:04:57] you look at Matthew 28:19 where Jesus
[1:05:00] said that baptize in the name of the
[1:05:02] Father Son and Holy Ghost and you you
[1:05:04] can read that where they just taking the
[1:05:07] letters off of the page but the letters
[1:05:09] will kill you but when you when you
[1:05:11] understand it with a revelation with it
[1:05:13] when God speaks to you and opens up the
[1:05:15] true meaning of that how the correct way
[1:05:17] to be baptized the correct approach to
[1:05:20] God the correct the correct his correct
[1:05:23] will then you can come to him in the
[1:05:25] right way you must have a revelation for
[1:05:29] your own self so many times we rely on
[1:05:32] the revelation of our momma and daddy to
[1:05:34] tell us to tell us who we should get
[1:05:35] married to let's say it like that to
[1:05:37] tell us where we should live and what
[1:05:39] church we should go to but you've got to
[1:05:41] have a revelation for yourself and all
[1:05:43] these young people in this church one
[1:05:45] day you're going to come to a place
[1:05:46] where you're going to have to
[1:05:47] make a decision what kind of a church
[1:05:49] you go to you're gonna make a decision
[1:05:51] whether or not you sit at home in this
[1:05:52] stream in or sit at home and listen to
[1:05:55] tapes or whether you actually go to a
[1:05:56] church that has a pastor you're gonna
[1:05:58] have to make a decision and it's gonna
[1:05:59] have to be based upon your personal
[1:06:01] revelation it can't be based upon your
[1:06:03] mom and daddys revelation we'll read
[1:06:06] another story in the Bible of a at first
[1:06:10] King this is another one in Kings first
[1:06:12] Kings chapter 13 there was an old
[1:06:14] prophet in Bethel and his sons came and
[1:06:16] told him all the works that the man of
[1:06:18] God another prophet had done and in
[1:06:20] which the death of the words which he
[1:06:23] had spoken unto the king we've got two
[1:06:25] prophets here and and one prophet went
[1:06:27] to do the word of the Lord and God told
[1:06:29] him don't deviate to the right of the
[1:06:31] left and this old prophet old revered
[1:06:34] prophet came and told him come on over
[1:06:36] to my house and we'll sit and fellowship
[1:06:39] for a little bit and he said well God
[1:06:41] the first prophet said well God told me
[1:06:43] not to deviate to the right or to the
[1:06:45] left and the old prophet who had been
[1:06:47] around for a while and she knows some
[1:06:48] things or not the Bible says he lied the
[1:06:51] Bible says he said that God told me to
[1:06:53] tell you to come over to my house you
[1:06:56] see you see that same thing as kid being
[1:06:58] carried out today where were people
[1:07:00] people rely so much on what other people
[1:07:03] tell them to do what other people tell
[1:07:05] them where they should go to church and
[1:07:07] all these things that they don't trust
[1:07:08] in God for a personal revelation of
[1:07:11] their own because that first prophet
[1:07:13] listen to the live the other prophet he
[1:07:15] died the lion jumped out and killed him
[1:07:17] you see
[1:07:18] but don't get tired on me now this is
[1:07:20] this is important you've got to have
[1:07:21] your own revelation of the Word of God
[1:07:23] you've got to have a personal revelation
[1:07:26] when you it's not enough just to know
[1:07:29] the letter of the word because the
[1:07:30] letter killeth but when you have a
[1:07:32] revelation when you have a personal
[1:07:34] revelation of what kind of person God
[1:07:35] wants you to marry you could knit you
[1:07:38] know you can have that you can have a
[1:07:39] personal revelation of what kind of job
[1:07:41] well God wants you to have God can
[1:07:44] reveal to you where he wants you to work
[1:07:46] but that's got to be your personal
[1:07:48] revelation and don't work if your mama
[1:07:50] and daddy are constantly guiding you
[1:07:51] they don't work if you're constantly
[1:07:53] having to go to somebody else to
[1:07:55] instruct you and wearing what you should
[1:07:56] do and what path you should take
[1:07:58] but when God reveals
[1:08:00] reveals to you the way that that God can
[1:08:03] save you but when he reveals you to you
[1:08:06] that he can feel you with the Holy Ghost
[1:08:07] when he reveals to you that he can feel
[1:08:10] you with all these virtues when he
[1:08:12] reveals you to you he can make manifest
[1:08:14] in your life the capstone when he
[1:08:16] reveals to you all those things that's
[1:08:18] not something that somebody else told
[1:08:19] you but it's something that God has
[1:08:21] personally revealed to you and when it's
[1:08:23] revealed it will come to pass that's one
[1:08:27] thing I think so many in the message are
[1:08:29] kind of that getting weary with it
[1:08:31] they're wondering if the word will
[1:08:33] actually produce something and then
[1:08:35] we'll go back to what I ought what I
[1:08:37] originally said the reason the word is
[1:08:39] not effective in your life is because of
[1:08:41] your self wheel self will will prevent
[1:08:44] the word for coming to pass and being
[1:08:47] made manifest in your life but when you
[1:08:49] allow the word to take effect in your
[1:08:51] life when you shun all these worldly
[1:08:54] influences when you don't eat from off
[1:08:56] of that tree of knowledge of good and
[1:08:58] evil and you begin to eat from the tree
[1:09:00] of life then it will produce the word in
[1:09:02] your life it will make itself manifest
[1:09:07] and let's keep going through this story
[1:09:10] I'm trying to I'm trying to come to a
[1:09:12] stopping point I see everybody get kind
[1:09:14] of tired and you know when you get tired
[1:09:16] that's when it get it gets real good
[1:09:20] don't don't
[1:09:22] don't listen to the devil the devil try
[1:09:23] to get that sleepy spirit on you and
[1:09:26] just just ruin your blessing and second
[1:09:29] Kings chapter 8 verses 4 to 6 we'll just
[1:09:31] keep reading known and the King talked
[1:09:32] with gauzy the servant of the man of God
[1:09:34] saying tell me I pray thee all the great
[1:09:36] things that Elisha hath done alright we
[1:09:42] got it
[1:09:43] tell me all these great things that
[1:09:46] Elisha had done and while he's talking
[1:09:48] well God jaha's is testifying to the
[1:09:51] king here comes the woman and it came to
[1:09:54] pass as he was telling the King how he
[1:09:56] had restored a dead body to life that
[1:09:59] behold the woman whose son he had
[1:10:01] restored the life cried to the King for
[1:10:04] her house and for her land and God he
[1:10:07] said my lord o king this is the woman
[1:10:11] and this is her son whom
[1:10:13] Elijah restored to life and when the
[1:10:16] King asked the woman she told him so the
[1:10:19] king appointed unto her a certain
[1:10:20] officer saying restore all that was hers
[1:10:24] and all the fruits of the fields since
[1:10:26] the day that she left the land even
[1:10:29] until now you see this woman as Gahan
[1:10:35] was testifying of what had happened that
[1:10:37] this woman had had a son promised to her
[1:10:39] and this son had been raised from the
[1:10:43] dead and now this woman actually comes
[1:10:46] before the king and she has the evidence
[1:10:49] that the promised son has risen at her
[1:10:52] myths and I want to say tonight that the
[1:10:53] bride has the evidence that Jesus Christ
[1:10:56] is risen from the dead that he is
[1:10:59] walking in her mist in the midst of the
[1:11:02] church he is fulfilling and performing
[1:11:04] the same acts he's acting the same way
[1:11:06] that he did when he walked on the shores
[1:11:08] of Galilee and here's the evidence just
[1:11:11] like this this son his son was not
[1:11:13] walking with this woman it was not just
[1:11:15] a little baby anymore but he had grown
[1:11:17] up into the full stature he was walking
[1:11:20] there in his fullness and she came and
[1:11:22] she said this this is the son I have the
[1:11:25] evidence that he is risen from the dead
[1:11:27] and that's what the whole world is
[1:11:29] looking for today the evidence that the
[1:11:32] that the promised son is risen from the
[1:11:34] dead and the bride is the one that has
[1:11:36] that evidence because the bride knows
[1:11:38] the will of God and the will of God was
[1:11:41] for all that she had lost all that she
[1:11:44] had lost to be restored you see we're
[1:11:46] not living in an age of where God God
[1:11:50] nobody that's taken back now God is not
[1:11:52] taken back but this is an age of
[1:11:55] restoration where everything that we
[1:11:57] have lost has been given back this is a
[1:12:00] there is a ministry on earth preaching
[1:12:03] to a people that cannot fail that you
[1:12:06] cannot fail because you're living in an
[1:12:09] age where God everything that the
[1:12:12] windows of heaven have been opened up
[1:12:13] and all the world has been restored so
[1:12:17] that you could know the word for your
[1:12:19] day listen to promise that the promise
[1:12:22] of the word is that in Revelation
[1:12:26] chapter 11 verse 15
[1:12:27] the kingdoms of this world have become
[1:12:28] the kingdoms of our Lord and of his
[1:12:30] Christ and he shall reign forever and
[1:12:32] ever what that means is that God is
[1:12:34] overcoming everything you're probably
[1:12:37] the promise that the bride has is that
[1:12:40] all of the world all of these things are
[1:12:43] you have power to overcome in you yeah
[1:12:46] that's what you were you were not
[1:12:49] predestinated to live under the power of
[1:12:52] sin or to get joy out of things of this
[1:12:54] world but you are predestinated and
[1:12:56] promised to overcome you see and words
[1:13:01] the word has an effect you know even in
[1:13:04] our in our humanistic realm when you
[1:13:06] speak words when you speak words to one
[1:13:08] another at work it creates an atmosphere
[1:13:10] when you sit in church and you know when
[1:13:13] the word begins to get priest real real
[1:13:15] hard and it'll create like almost a
[1:13:18] settled atmosphere where everybody kind
[1:13:20] of gets tensed up a little bit because
[1:13:22] words will create an atmosphere words
[1:13:25] will have an effect the Word of God is
[1:13:28] having an effect in your life it's
[1:13:30] causing something to take place the word
[1:13:33] is creating an atmosphere and we have
[1:13:36] not heard just the words of a man but
[1:13:38] the word spoken is creating an
[1:13:40] atmosphere in our lives just like the
[1:13:42] word spoken in the Genesis created an
[1:13:45] atmosphere for an overcoming man and
[1:13:48] woman to walk in and live in it created
[1:13:51] an atmosphere and the words that are
[1:13:53] spoken the night I believe are creating
[1:13:55] an atmosphere is faith because whenever
[1:13:58] the Word of God is spoken it will cause
[1:14:00] the people to catch a hold and to
[1:14:02] realize the the will of God to be able
[1:14:05] to look into the Word of God his word
[1:14:07] will produce words can sting and cut and
[1:14:11] and harm and all those things but you
[1:14:13] see or any kind of relationship has
[1:14:15] found that old words any kind of a
[1:14:18] relationship between a man and a woman
[1:14:21] is is based on words not so much feeling
[1:14:24] it might start on feelings and emotion
[1:14:27] and all those kind of things and I'll
[1:14:29] say that's maybe where Pentecost failed
[1:14:31] is because they got so caught up in the
[1:14:33] emotion that they failed to continue on
[1:14:36] to the words that are being spoken but
[1:14:39] we're now
[1:14:40] not under and and a dispensation so much
[1:14:43] of emotion and feeling and everything
[1:14:45] but now we're coming into a true
[1:14:47] relationship truth fellowship with God
[1:14:49] which is based on words words will have
[1:14:54] an effect and the Word of God falling
[1:14:57] into your soul will have an effect on
[1:14:59] your life it will produce the only thing
[1:15:04] that's keeping it from producing is the
[1:15:05] ground
[1:15:06] that's that parable that Jesus told in
[1:15:09] Matthew chapter 13 this some seeds fell
[1:15:12] by the wayside some fell upon stony
[1:15:14] places some fell among thorns but and
[1:15:16] all those things prevented the word from
[1:15:19] producing but if it falls into good
[1:15:22] ground if it fall if the Word of God
[1:15:24] falls into a ground where that where you
[1:15:28] were willing to die out to yourself
[1:15:30] where you're willing to search out the
[1:15:32] word where you're willing to find out
[1:15:34] whether these things are true or not it
[1:15:36] will produce you see you're actually a
[1:15:40] creator when you speak the words of God
[1:15:42] you're we're in training ground to be
[1:15:46] creators because God is teaching us how
[1:15:48] to speak the word and when you speak the
[1:15:51] word it creates an atmosphere and it
[1:15:55] will produce whether I'm sitting looking
[1:15:56] at the unseen when a man once catches
[1:15:59] that vision of the invisible God and
[1:16:01] know that he's always prison there's
[1:16:04] something that stabilizes that man's
[1:16:07] thinking it stabilizes his actions and
[1:16:10] in the time of distress and trouble
[1:16:12] it'll still make him look upward and
[1:16:15] above the things that are happening
[1:16:16] around him because he's looking at the
[1:16:18] unseen yet by promise now how Abraham
[1:16:21] not only did he see the unseen and the
[1:16:23] reason he believed it was because God
[1:16:26] said it and if we being dead in Christ
[1:16:29] we are Abraham's seed and if the spirit
[1:16:32] that was in Christ dwells in us it does
[1:16:35] the same thing it does the same thing
[1:16:39] I'm a close on that while I just kind of
[1:16:42] finish every other musicians can come
[1:16:43] forward you see the reason the reason
[1:16:46] why we are Abraham's seed is because we
[1:16:49] know that if God said it
[1:16:52] we'll just believe
[1:16:53] the reason he believed it was because
[1:16:56] God said it if God said it then that
[1:16:59] that that is God's Word that is his will
[1:17:02] his will is his word so maybe I'll leave
[1:17:05] you tonight with a question what kind of
[1:17:07] heart do you have a heart to believe
[1:17:09] God's Word a heart just to accept it to
[1:17:12] accept the Word of God to open up your
[1:17:14] heart to accept the will of God the
[1:17:16] reason he believed it was because God
[1:17:20] said it if God said you can be healed
[1:17:23] you can be healed
[1:17:24] if God said you can receive the Holy
[1:17:26] Ghost you can receive it if God sent it
[1:17:29] you can believe it the reason he
[1:17:32] believed it was because God said because
[1:17:37] let's stand to our feet you love the
[1:17:41] Lord tonight I believe a revelation of
[1:17:47] God's Word gives us something to worship
[1:17:50] with a real believer should be able to
[1:17:52] worship like nobody else
