[16:31] is i don't think we're going to go
[16:32] outside and take communion at one
[16:34] o'clock
[16:34] or 12 o'clock at night we better stay in
[16:36] here and do that
[16:38] so we're going to do it in a safe way
[16:39] like we did before so don't worry about
[16:41] that
[16:42] all right that okay you know they
[16:46] they say they say if they ever died we'd
[16:49] be in trouble
[16:50] they said they always say that what you
[16:52] do on the first day of the year
[16:54] is what you do the rest of the year so
[16:56] we praise god and take communion
[16:58] amen so that we have communion they do
[17:01] all their stuff out there
[17:03] but i also wish richard that you know
[17:05] you you're off usually we're off january
[17:07] the first
[17:08] yeah right so that's not what we're
[17:10] doing all the rest of the year we got to
[17:12] go back to work january the second

[17:32] uh we'll do this one and i i i think i'm
[17:35] doing next sunday too
[17:36] right yeah okay and then that will
[17:39] probably
[17:40] wind up this one and then i think
[17:43] if if it's all right with you guys i
[17:46] think
[17:46] we may start the first of the year with
[17:50] some of the major doctrines since we're
[17:53] talking about these two spirits
[17:56] and we see there's new ones coming in
[17:57] that that when we say things that we say
[17:59] they
[18:00] you know it's all new to them and um
[18:04] even some of the older ones we like to
[18:05] brush up on our on our knowledge of the
[18:08] word of god
[18:09] and why we believe what why we believe
[18:12] what we believe while we're sitting here
[18:14] today and not sitting somewhere else
[18:16] amen
[18:17] so we may start that january the 3rd we
[18:19] will be doing two services so we'll be
[18:21] back to
[18:22] brother dale myself as far as we know so
[18:26] we'll just do that and
[18:28] but we will be here next this coming
[18:31] wednesday and sunday regular time
[18:33] regular the way we've been first john 4.
[18:36] today we're going to speak on satan
[18:38] exposed because there's got to be a time
[18:41] when we see the we it's okay to see see
[18:43] these two spirits and see how they work
[18:46] but someone has to be exposed to where
[18:48] we can look at that and say aha
[18:51] that's what that is and then you don't
[18:53] go there
[18:54] because i was reading the bible
[18:56] yesterday or day four yesterday it says
[18:58] two cannot walk together unless they
[19:01] agree
[19:02] because somewhere you're gonna rub
[19:04] shoulders or you're gonna grind noses or
[19:06] something
[19:07] if you're not both in like i said before
[19:11] how many truths are they there's only
[19:13] one truth
[19:15] there's not and and you know we go back
[19:17] to the 900 and something different
[19:18] denominations that was
[19:20] in 1964. there's like 13 000 different
[19:24] denominations in the world now different
[19:26] factions different beliefs
[19:28] god is not that confused
[19:31] man has confused this thing to where
[19:34] the paul said by the simplicity of the
[19:37] gospel
[19:39] just read it like what it says
[19:42] and we'll be all right amen but good to
[19:45] have everybody here and
[19:47] we want to thank brother dale again for
[19:48] what he did for us last weekend amen
[19:51] the food and the lodging man that was a
[19:53] beautiful place and
[19:55] thank all of you for taking some
[19:56] wonderful pictures and posting them on
[19:58] facebook that's really pretty

[20:05] the lord's still
[20:07] with us and we're still with we'll still
[20:09] with the world if not then we'll have

[20:16] ones

[20:19] verse 1 and let's pray before we get
[20:21] started the heavenly father thank you
[20:22] for this day
[20:24] thank you for a time and an opportunity
[20:25] to stand before
[20:27] the true purchased possession that you
[20:29] before the foundation of the world lord
[20:32] you didn't just figure this out you saw
[20:35] this
[20:37] you saw this in a reality in your mind
[20:39] lord and now we've come to the place to
[20:41] where as you said
[20:42] in your word that you were slain before
[20:44] the foundation of the world but there
[20:46] had to come a time when you literally
[20:47] came to this earth
[20:49] and was slain on a cross and lifted up
[20:52] as the
[20:52] sacrifice lord we were as we sing that
[20:55] song we
[20:56] look back in the old testament and we
[20:58] see how the
[21:00] the priest had to lift up they had to
[21:02] give a heave offering
[21:04] they had to lift up lord the ham or
[21:07] whatever it was the shoulder the part of
[21:10] of the sacrifice lord just showing that
[21:12] one day that we were going to have to
[21:14] look up to you father
[21:16] that they were gonna put you your flesh
[21:17] on a cross
[21:19] and you were gonna die for our sins but
[21:21] as that sacrifice could not come back
[21:23] and make the
[21:25] believer perfect lord you came back on
[21:28] the day of pentecost and started making
[21:30] people perfect and completing you father
[21:32] we thank you for that lord
[21:34] let us have a dip of that holy ghost
[21:36] again today lord may the fire
[21:38] fall the tongues of fire like you did on
[21:40] the day of pentecost lord come and give
[21:41] us a rejuvenation
[21:44] lord something to take us through to
[21:45] this new year father we
[21:47] ask that you be with the ones that are
[21:48] sick brother homer longoria lord being
[21:50] in there in the hospital i think with
[21:51] pneumonia
[21:52] all the different ones sister rita
[21:53] montgomery lord and the loss of her
[21:55] husband
[21:56] all the different ones lord we just we
[21:58] got we've got to bind together unto you
[22:00] lord and not let that fear as the two
[22:02] sisters saying lord fear is a liar
[22:06] you have no fear
[22:10] everywhere you went you said fear not
[22:12] because you knew that fear would be
[22:13] there
[22:14] lord now we pray that you take this fear
[22:16] away from us that we're not groping in
[22:18] darkness
[22:20] but we've been shown the true light
[22:22] father give us this day our daily bread
[22:23] in jesus name we pray
[22:25] amen first john 4 believe it
[22:29] beloved believe not every spirit but try
[22:32] the spirits whether they are of god
[22:34] because many false prophets are going
[22:36] out into the world that's what i want to
[22:37] do i want you to try this thing
[22:39] not try not try it but try them put them
[22:42] on trial
[22:43] yes right put it on trial
[22:47] because the devil is going to put it on
[22:49] trial
[22:50] he's going to try you to see what you
[22:53] believe
[22:54] and you know what god's going to let him
[22:56] yeah amen
[22:58] because god don't have to prove to satan
[23:00] he's the creator
[23:02] that's right but we have to prove that
[23:04] that creator is in us
[23:06] amen by overcoming the things of the
[23:09] world
[23:10] hereby know you the spirit of god every
[23:11] spirit that confesses that jesus christ
[23:13] has come in the flesh is of god
[23:15] and every spirit that confesses not that
[23:17] jesus christ has come in the flesh is
[23:18] not of god
[23:19] and this is that spirit of antichrist
[23:21] whereof you have heard that it should
[23:23] come now remember that's 2000 years ago
[23:25] in its infancy we are dealing with a
[23:27] full grown man
[23:29] the devil is has got smarter
[23:35] amen even now already is in the world he
[23:38] says
[23:39] year of god little children have
[23:40] overcome them because greater is he
[23:42] that's in you than he that's in the
[23:43] world
[23:44] they are of the world therefore speak
[23:46] they of the world and the world heareth
[23:47] them
[23:48] we are of god he that knoweth god
[23:50] heareth us he that is not of god
[23:52] here's not us pretty simple huh hereby
[23:56] know we
[23:57] the spirit of truth and the spirit of
[24:00] error
[24:00] you may be seated in the lord as
[24:02] blessing a reading of the word
[24:05] in an exposition of the church ages if
[24:07] you want to pull that one up this is one
[24:08] we read all the time we're going to keep
[24:10] reading it
[24:10] because i see a lot of things in there
[24:12] that that
[24:13] that if we take that one quote right
[24:16] there
[24:19] we'll take a body change if we'll see
[24:22] that
[24:22] and understand it christ now remember
[24:25] christ in the true church
[24:28] then it's got to be false christ in the
[24:31] true church
[24:32] is a continuation of the book of acts
[24:36] now look a continuation of the book of
[24:38] acts
[24:39] what was the book of acts the holy ghost
[24:41] fell on 120 they went out ministering
[24:44] they went out telling the world not that
[24:47] there was
[24:47] a trinity of gods
[24:52] not that the water baptism was in the
[24:54] name of the father son holy ghost no
[24:56] no peter was the one that said be
[24:58] baptized in the name of jesus christ
[25:00] through the holy spirit and we believe
[25:03] that jesus christ god and the holy
[25:04] spirit's the same person so they can't
[25:06] contradict each other
[25:08] most of the religions of the day you
[25:10] look at them and you think well god's in
[25:11] he's mad at jesus and jesus and the holy
[25:14] ghost ain't got nothing
[25:14] they can't get it together no they got
[25:17] it together
[25:18] we the ones that don't have it together
[25:21] amen so let's just blame us for that
[25:24] not god but the book of revelation show
[25:26] how that the antichrist spirit would
[25:28] come into the church
[25:29] defile it make it lukewarm formal and
[25:30] powerless
[25:32] and this is where i got my thought today
[25:33] it exposes satan
[25:36] all right so it's going to something is
[25:38] going to expose him
[25:40] but remember from the garden of eden
[25:42] until today
[25:44] or until i say 1963
[25:47] satan was hid he was not hid in the bars
[25:51] and the drunks and
[25:52] he was hid in religion he was hid in
[25:56] religion
[26:00] but somewhere he has to be exposed
[26:06] because we're going to read in second
[26:07] thessalonians here where that man of sin
[26:10] has got to be exposed he's got to be
[26:13] revealed all right or he's got to be
[26:16] made known
[26:17] so that we know when jesus told them
[26:19] after he preached the six seals
[26:22] he said don't go over here if somebody
[26:25] says christ is over here
[26:27] why do you not go over there because
[26:29] he's here you've got a revelation that
[26:31] he's inside of you you don't have to go
[26:32] over there and get it
[26:34] it's already inside of you but that's a
[26:35] revelation though that you've got to get
[26:38] that's why it's a personal experience
[26:39] with god
[26:41] not just some saying some novenas or
[26:44] saying hail mary's or whatever they do
[26:46] you know all those things just just
[26:48] believe
[26:49] and and you know go live any way you
[26:51] want to that's not the way
[26:52] that's not the way i you know i was
[26:54] thinking yesterday
[26:58] we have this and don't get me wrong
[27:00] jesus christ
[27:02] is the savior of the world amen he'll
[27:05] save your soul if you'll ask him
[27:07] but he does not want you to stay a baby
[27:10] do you want your kids to stay babies no
[27:12] you want to grow up
[27:14] right so jesus christ when he comes into
[27:16] your soul he comes in and you are a
[27:18] newborn what paul said
[27:19] babe baby but he does not want you to
[27:23] stay
[27:24] baby because he said desiring the
[27:27] sincere milk of the word he said but you
[27:29] got to take some meat
[27:31] we had some good steak and taters last
[27:33] night but you know what i had a cold
[27:34] glass of milk yesterday morning too
[27:36] but i had state and potatoes you know
[27:38] why cause i'm grown up
[27:40] right hey man you're grown up then today
[27:42] you come and you eat some beans
[27:44] you eat some potatoes something with
[27:45] some meat in it amen
[27:48] because we desire the sincere milk of
[27:50] the word but we desire though that we go
[27:52] on god desires that we go on
[27:57] you say well it's just so easy just to
[27:58] be a baby you know we were
[28:00] playing with little hudson yesterday and
[28:01] that's kind of where i was what i was
[28:03] thinking and
[28:04] you know we did everything for him
[28:09] i mean he can even walk and here's mama
[28:10] got him by the hand
[28:13] no he can walk let him go but all of us
[28:17] were oh
[28:17] wipe his mouth i gotta go change his
[28:19] diaper i got to go feed him
[28:21] we got shh hudson's got to take him out
[28:26] then you the mama dissipated you see
[28:28] what i mean but now
[28:30] they didn't obviously didn't do me that
[28:31] way
[28:36] mama didn't come over and get me by the
[28:37] hand say come on wait let's go we got
[28:39] toys down here to play with
[28:42] you understand what i mean it's okay
[28:45] being a baby
[28:46] but it's not okay to stay a baby amen
[28:49] you got to grow up in god
[28:51] and you got to make that choice that's
[28:53] right i can't make that choice for you
[28:55] know what you've got
[28:56] it's got to be revealed to you that god
[28:58] wants to give you more than you already
[29:00] got
[29:01] amen god will give you more if you ask
[29:05] him
[29:06] but see what what the world does is they
[29:08] they they look at us and they say well
[29:10] well you don't cut your hair women and
[29:12] you don't wear pants and
[29:14] because we do what the bible says find
[29:17] me any other
[29:17] find me the other opposite of it it's
[29:19] not in the bible man has by what
[29:22] misinterpreted theology has told you it
[29:25] was okay to do that
[29:27] but we see it in the word of god but see
[29:28] they look at us like oh poor pitiful
[29:30] women
[29:31] poor pitiful men they don't get to go
[29:32] out and have a beer with the guys and
[29:34] and you know go to ball games and they
[29:37] don't sit and
[29:38] talk about cars and it's okay to do that
[29:41] not the beer part but they don't talk
[29:43] about cars and stuff
[29:44] but that's consumes people we were
[29:47] watching football game last night or
[29:48] yesterday on the screen you know there
[29:50] to
[29:51] um at the cabin we were in or lodge
[29:54] and then people are idiots but they're
[29:56] idiots for their football team
[30:00] i mean you gotta i don't know why i'm
[30:03] doing this
[30:03] go to green bay wisconsin the coldest
[30:06] place in the world
[30:07] well coldest place in the united states
[30:09] and green bay is playing
[30:11] yeah well minnesota is green bay is
[30:14] playing
[30:15] football and it's like 10 below zero
[30:18] you got ever how many letters it takes
[30:22] to spell green bay
[30:23] or packers there's that many idiots with
[30:26] no shirt on
[30:28] with a big old pea right here you see
[30:30] what i mean
[30:31] brother brown said i want to be a fool
[30:33] for christ
[30:34] if we become a fool like that toward the
[30:37] word of god
[30:38] like they put it toward that then we'll
[30:40] be okay amen
[30:42] that's exactly what if you look at the
[30:44] world and you see what they're doing
[30:47] because they look at you and they go oh
[30:48] poor people y'all so depressed and so
[30:50] beat down
[30:51] and you know we're the happiest people
[30:53] in the world
[30:54] hey man we got truth we're going
[30:56] somewhere hey man
[30:58] we got somewhere to go we've had a guide
[31:02] to tell us about it and that guide is
[31:04] now inside of you
[31:05] i mean the holy ghost amen right you can
[31:08] have an anointing but to have the true
[31:10] baptism of the holy ghost will give you
[31:11] this what true church
[31:13] you can't be a true church without
[31:14] having it that's right because he's not
[31:16] going by the church
[31:17] building amen he's talking about church
[31:20] people
[31:21] amen bride it exposes satan
[31:24] revealing his works the attempted
[31:26] destruction of god's people
[31:28] and the discrediting of god's word right
[31:29] down to the time he is cast into the
[31:31] lake of fire he fights that
[31:33] he cannot stand it he knows that if the
[31:36] people get the true revelation of the
[31:38] true church
[31:39] and what she is and what she stands for
[31:42] then she can do the greater works
[31:44] she will be an invincible army if they
[31:46] get a true how many times he says true
[31:48] true church true revelation true
[31:50] revelation true
[31:51] truth like i said last time pilate was
[31:54] so confused he said what is truth
[31:58] we've had that answer we've got that
[32:00] answer to that
[32:01] what is truth amen he knows that if he
[32:05] gets the true revelation of the true
[32:06] church and what she
[32:08] is what she stands for that she can do
[32:10] the greater work she will be an
[32:11] invincible army
[32:12] if they get a true revelation of the two
[32:14] spirits within the framework of the
[32:16] christian church and by god's spirit
[32:18] discern and withstand the antichrist
[32:20] spirit satan will be powerless
[32:22] before her does that that means he's got
[32:24] some kind of power right now
[32:26] and it's permitted power and it's
[32:28] permitted power that you give him
[32:30] right and i give him amen like brother
[32:33] gary
[32:34] atkins always said he said you know he
[32:36] said that first horse rider was a
[32:38] uh had a white horse and it was a man
[32:40] sitting on the horse with a bow and no
[32:42] arrows
[32:44] so how's he gonna shoot you he's a bluff
[32:48] but what we do every morning we get up
[32:50] and we get about 20 of
[32:51] 20 arrows and we hand them to him so
[32:53] here shoot us amen
[32:57] we hand him the arrows quit handing him
[32:59] the arrows
[33:01] because he just go bling point point
[33:03] never even that that
[33:04] means nothing i wouldn't do that for his
[33:07] deer
[33:08] hunting especially bear hunting we won't
[33:10] want to do that would you
[33:12] why because it's powerless that bows
[33:14] powerless without a without an arrow
[33:16] with it amen
[33:17] so we give him the arrows to use on us
[33:20] let's read john 17 verse 16 through 19.
[33:24] they are not of the world even as i am
[33:26] not of the world
[33:28] sanctify them through thy truth thy word
[33:32] is truth
[33:33] not a word thy word right
[33:37] as thou has sent me into the world even
[33:39] so have i also sent them into the world
[33:42] and for their sake i sanctify myself
[33:45] that they also might be sanctified
[33:48] through the truth
[33:49] all right so what's going to clean you
[33:51] up the truth what's going to keep you
[33:52] clean
[33:53] the truth all right ii timothy 3 verse 6
[33:58] says having a form of godliness but
[34:00] denying the power thereof from search
[34:02] turn away
[34:03] for this sword are they which creep into
[34:05] houses elite captives
[34:06] silly women women as white churches
[34:10] silly churches what silly doctrines
[34:12] laden with sins and led away with divers
[34:14] lust
[34:15] ever learning now they're learning
[34:19] they're learning about jesus and they're
[34:20] learning about this time of year they
[34:23] say is when
[34:23] you know jesus was born and all that we
[34:26] know that's not true we just kind of go
[34:27] along with the program
[34:28] not knock the rock the boat right all
[34:31] right every learning and never able look
[34:33] never able to come to the knowledge of
[34:36] the truth
[34:38] now as janice and jamers withstood moses
[34:41] so do these also resist the truth
[34:45] wow men of corrupt minds
[34:49] reprobate concerning the faith in other
[34:52] words denying that this is the truth
[34:55] but they shall proceed no further thank
[34:58] the lord
[34:59] for their follies shall be manifest unto
[35:01] all men
[35:03] as theirs also was so thank god for that
[35:06] now let's look right here in revelations
[35:08] 3 14 and i just came to my mind
[35:10] everybody tomorrow or tonight say a
[35:12] prayer for brother claude weisinger he's
[35:14] having his gallbladder taken out
[35:15] tomorrow
[35:16] so just say a prayer for brother claude
[35:18] we called him
[35:20] thursday or wednesday or sometime and
[35:22] and he said for us to pray for him
[35:24] get that gallbladder out and he can get
[35:27] back home because it's really giving him
[35:28] a lot of trouble i don't know if any of
[35:29] you had gall brother
[35:30] gall bladder trouble before and surgery
[35:33] um
[35:34] he was been in a lot of pain so let's
[35:36] just remember brother claude and he lost
[35:37] brother johnny silke as
[35:39] he lost his song leader the guy that
[35:40] opened the door the guy that swept the
[35:42] floors
[35:43] he passed away with coven a couple weeks
[35:45] ago so just there's an
[35:47] empty hole there just remember then the
[35:49] little church there in bartlesville
[35:50] until the angel of the church will lay
[35:52] out the sands which is where us
[35:55] that's this is the end this is the
[35:57] seventh church age this is the last this
[35:59] is the finality
[36:01] these things saith the amen what amen
[36:05] the faithful and true witness not that
[36:08] he was a false witness
[36:11] but the faithful and true witness the
[36:14] beginning
[36:15] of the creation of god as brother dale's
[36:17] been preaching that's what
[36:19] you see the beginning of the creation of
[36:20] god the beginning of the creation of god
[36:23] is when god
[36:24] stepped into human flesh and became a
[36:27] baby
[36:28] not melchizedek not meeting not the
[36:31] captain of the host that met
[36:33] that that met david not the one that
[36:36] was with daniel in the lion's den
[36:38] because that wasn't
[36:39] like me and you
[36:44] but god came down in human flesh
[36:47] come through a womb just like you did
[36:50] took nine months to develop
[36:52] but it was immaculate conception not by
[36:54] the
[36:55] loins of a man but by the mind of god
[36:58] coming to a lady and saying look
[37:00] you're going to have a baby no one no
[37:02] man
[37:03] and she she pondered on a little while
[37:05] but finally she said what
[37:06] be it unto me according to what you just
[37:09] said
[37:10] what she must something rang true it was
[37:13] truth to that
[37:14] because you know why it happened glory
[37:18] when we see these things happen we know
[37:20] that it's truth
[37:21] if we're walking in the light but though
[37:23] so the beginning of the creation of god
[37:25] now remember if he's the beginning
[37:29] thank god he sent us a prophet if
[37:30] there's a beginning of the creation of
[37:32] god
[37:33] that means there's got to be something
[37:35] coming after that
[37:37] if not he would be the finishing of the
[37:39] creation of god
[37:40] we look at this and we say well this is
[37:42] the finishing of the church ages
[37:43] this is the finishing of the gentile age
[37:46] but it's the beginning
[37:50] because you know what there's somebody
[37:52] it may just be one person
[37:54] it's going to fulfill the scripture that
[37:55] says we which are alive and remain
[37:58] amen glory
[38:01] we which are alive and remain shall not
[38:03] prevent or hinder
[38:04] that will take and finalize what that
[38:08] scripture's saying right there
[38:10] jesus christ came in human flesh died
[38:13] come back is picked up his body his body
[38:16] was made eternal does that sound
[38:18] familiar
[38:20] if you've got the baptism the holy ghost
[38:22] romans 8 says that that same spirit that
[38:23] dwells in you
[38:24] and jesus christ dwells in you it will
[38:27] quicken your mortal body and if you do
[38:29] have to go by the grave that's all right
[38:30] because you're going to come out a new
[38:32] what creation
[38:34] because the old creation is what our
[38:36] problem is
[38:41] because it was created in sin jesus
[38:43] christ was not created in sin he was
[38:46] created in purity
[38:48] amen so that true faithful and true
[38:50] witness now look
[38:52] the greek lexicon says alathinos that
[38:54] which is not only the name and
[38:56] resemblance but the real nature
[38:58] corresponding to the name because
[39:00] remember
[39:01] we we see where the prophet in in the
[39:04] church ages he
[39:05] tells us and look we go down through the
[39:06] church ages and we see what was lost
[39:09] the name was lost they don't baptize in
[39:12] the name of the lord jesus
[39:14] christ anymore well i mean we do but
[39:17] they didn't back in the church ages
[39:19] after about the third church age we're
[39:21] going to get into the seals first back
[39:22] again for a second
[39:24] but after the third church age that
[39:26] white righteous church started eroding
[39:29] the message of the hour their message of
[39:31] the hour
[39:32] and they took forth a lie like i said in
[39:35] in
[39:36] laodicea comes into nicaea
[39:39] and nicea accepts all this false
[39:42] doctrine
[39:43] okay who is that that's the devil god's
[39:46] not in false doctrine
[39:48] but we read where the true went to the
[39:51] false
[39:51] the true went to that meeting and
[39:55] because of earthly power satan overtook
[39:58] them
[39:59] and they just started accepting but
[40:02] because us coming in the end times the
[40:04] faithful and true witness
[40:05] but the real nature corresponding to the
[40:07] name now that's not saying
[40:09] that that martin luther and john wesley
[40:12] didn't have the characteristics of god
[40:14] they did they just didn't have all the
[40:15] characteristics of god
[40:17] you and i are the finality we are the
[40:19] amen we are the last
[40:22] and we've got to have that truth
[40:25] that truth has got to come back and it
[40:28] did come back
[40:31] and if you got the holy ghost today you
[40:33] got to believe that it came back
[40:35] because that's what that's the sounding
[40:37] board
[40:39] that's the hearing of the trumpet
[40:43] because remember we got to hear the last
[40:46] trumpet
[40:47] there is a last message to the gentile
[40:50] church age and you're listening to it
[40:51] right
[40:52] now amen you're listening to it right
[40:54] now not just me
[40:56] but all the ministers of this church and
[40:58] when you press play and when you talk
[40:59] about the lord
[41:01] in this end time you're the finality
[41:05] because i said before i'll read this
[41:07] quote again they don't have it but in
[41:08] the rising of the sun brother brown said
[41:10] there's been churches churches
[41:11] brides brides churches brides brides
[41:15] but there's got to come one
[41:18] god don't have three or four wives he's
[41:21] got one wife
[41:22] but she's in multiple form called the
[41:24] bride amen
[41:26] there has to come a real bride there
[41:28] must come one that's not
[41:30] only got the mechanics but the dynamics
[41:34] until we come to that place until we
[41:36] find that place
[41:37] what good does it do to polish the hubs
[41:40] in other words you got this beautiful
[41:42] car
[41:44] 67 mustang
[41:49] ain't got a motor nun in it but
[41:52] buddy isn't she pretty
[41:55] isn't she pretty richer's out there
[41:57] every day polishing that thing
[41:59] you can see your reflection there you
[42:00] can get inside and sit down in it but
[42:02] when you turn the key and want to go
[42:04] somewhere
[42:06] there's nothing even if it's got a motor
[42:10] it's got to have some gas
[42:14] to make the spark because you can have a
[42:16] big what 289
[42:18] full barrel board strokes big old
[42:21] headers hanging off of it i heard one
[42:23] just a few minutes ago a mustang
[42:25] but he loves his loud mustang he let
[42:28] everybody know he loved it too but see
[42:30] that's what the world
[42:30] what are we doing what are we doing to
[42:33] show the world they're gonna drive down
[42:34] through here drag racing down through
[42:36] here why don't we drag race the word of
[42:37] god every once in a while
[42:39] amen start talking about god
[42:43] yes but he's out there with that thing
[42:44] and i mean here we are sitting there
[42:46] and boy they purr now when you do fire
[42:49] them up
[42:50] they purr but without one drop
[42:53] without one squirt of gasoline oh yeah
[42:59] it's as bound as worthless is that right
[43:01] there to get you somewhere
[43:03] amen same way with the word of god man
[43:06] has made it so
[43:09] convoluted which means they metal they
[43:11] meddled in it and it's all
[43:13] you look at this glass sometimes and you
[43:15] see glass that you can't really see
[43:16] through or
[43:17] or you them old me have you everybody
[43:19] seen one of those old mirrors that they
[43:20] made that were real thin
[43:22] and they made them they blew them and
[43:24] and you walk up to them and you look and
[43:26] your head's like this
[43:28] well that's the way that's the way
[43:29] they've done the word of god but there's
[43:30] a true mirror
[43:32] there's a true glass paul says well i
[43:34] look to a glass darkly but
[43:36] one day in other words truth is coming
[43:40] i may not see it paul says he said but
[43:42] i'm going to have a part of it
[43:44] i'm going to preach it and i believe god
[43:48] before they chopped his precious head
[43:49] off i believe god let him see
[43:52] the fruits of his because he wrote 80
[43:56] of the new testament and we believe that
[43:59] that what is truth
[44:01] paul says you'll be judged by my gospel
[44:02] now why
[44:04] we have a and people have a problem
[44:07] saying we're going to be judged by a
[44:09] prophet and the bible says and you read
[44:12] it
[44:14] where paul says you'll be judged by my
[44:16] gospel he said if an angel from heaven
[44:20] comes down to this earth and preaches
[44:23] something different than you heard
[44:24] me preach let him be a curse
[44:28] and he said it twice
[44:32] so it was a double confirmation right
[44:35] but we can't take truth from nobody else
[44:37] right
[44:39] i don't understand that you know why
[44:41] because it's not according to your
[44:42] normal
[44:44] it's not according to the world's normal
[44:46] we are not
[44:48] normal y'all talk about me not being
[44:51] normal y'all not normal either
[44:55] praise god
[45:00] i want somebody to notice
[45:05] a faithful and true witness
[45:08] not jesus christ jesus christ in you
[45:12] and when somebody says something about
[45:14] the word of god you can say
[45:16] right there's where it says it right
[45:20] right there's where it says it
[45:24] as i've always said before you you talk
[45:26] to people about certain things and they
[45:27] say oh that was just the old testament i
[45:28] said well where's the ten commandments
[45:32] where's the ten commandments they're in
[45:34] the old testament
[45:35] yeah we put them out on the yard but we
[45:37] can't take the new testament
[45:38] or we can't take all the rest of the old
[45:40] testament see what i mean about this all
[45:42] getting
[45:42] you know it's like they tear the pieces
[45:44] out they want to tear out
[45:46] and add what they want to add
[45:51] and what did jesus what did jesus drew
[45:54] john tell us in book of revelations you
[45:57] add
[45:57] two i'm going to add the plays you take
[46:00] it out i'm going to take your name out
[46:02] they lost the name down to the church
[46:04] ages and god said he
[46:05] brother brown said god blew out their
[46:08] candle
[46:09] what he moved on god is in motion that's
[46:13] why you see those jews over there on
[46:15] that wailing wall
[46:16] they say god is in motion they're not
[46:18] just doing that for for looks they're
[46:19] doing that because they know god's in
[46:21] motion
[46:22] and so we should know god's emotion most
[46:24] of you think god's in motion like this
[46:27] because that's what you're doing right
[46:28] now
[46:31] where's aaron now if this don't stir
[46:32] your soul your spoon fell out of your
[46:34] bowl
[46:36] because there's got to be a truth
[46:39] we can fiddle around here all we want to
[46:41] but somebody
[46:44] somebody you're going to look and say
[46:46] well where'd he go
[46:49] remember the bible remember the prophet
[46:51] of god said you'll be looking around one
[46:53] day and say
[46:55] well where's brother wade well i thought
[46:57] he went
[46:58] deer hunting no you can't go deer
[47:00] hunting and he got a gun and took him
[47:01] away from us
[47:05] don't worry but then that still small
[47:09] voice will say
[47:10] what you missed it
[47:14] you missed it you missed it
[47:18] but there's a true people that's not
[47:19] going to miss it
[47:23] you've got to press yourself into that
[47:26] right
[47:27] it does not come just by human listen
[47:30] you
[47:31] you must deny your human beginning
[47:35] you must deny your because you're going
[47:37] to say well it was because
[47:39] aunt susie was a drunk i'm a drunk no
[47:41] that ain't got nothing to do with it
[47:46] now there are some hereditary traits in
[47:47] your body that you can't get away from
[47:50] they say i walk like my grandpa one
[47:52] hip's higher than the other one i've
[47:53] never looked back there so
[47:55] but they m jim tells me that all the
[47:57] time no mama does actually
[47:59] right because one hips higher in the
[48:01] other one you know what that is a trait
[48:02] that i don't want but i got
[48:05] that trait from my grandpa that's a
[48:07] human physical trait but i mean all this
[48:09] other stuff we lean on
[48:10] well mama mama couldn't work so i can't
[48:13] work either
[48:14] daddy couldn't hold a job so i can not
[48:16] forget it come on people
[48:21] move forward move forward in god
[48:26] listen to this and number two
[48:30] god's provided place of worship prophet
[48:33] god said now at the end time we see the
[48:34] things happening the way they are
[48:36] there's a great warning amongst the
[48:38] elected people of god to find
[48:41] what is right
[48:44] are we doing that to find what is right
[48:46] and it behooves us
[48:48] to know that now not somebody's
[48:51] theory but to know what is truth what
[48:54] the bible says
[48:55] is truth because it'll be too late one
[48:58] of these days for us and this may be the
[49:00] day so let's take real consideration
[49:02] of what god has said remember when god
[49:04] speaks a word he can never
[49:06] take it back he has to ever remain the
[49:09] same how about that what kind of
[49:11] assurance do we have
[49:13] that he ain't gonna right in the middle
[49:14] of the ball game he's gonna change and
[49:16] we're gonna go in another direction no
[49:20] in his mind the war has already been
[49:22] fought the battle's already won
[49:24] and he wrote it in the book and told us
[49:25] that hey man we just gotta know what the
[49:27] book says
[49:31] he can never say something and then say
[49:33] well i didn't
[49:35] exactly mean it that way no we've done
[49:37] that before right
[49:38] he is infinite he knows the best to
[49:40] begin with we say things that we think
[49:42] is best then after a while
[49:44] we take it back but god can't do that
[49:46] and remain god
[49:47] so if he is infinite he does not do that
[49:50] because he's a per
[49:51] he's perfect in every word he never
[49:53] utters a word unless it's what
[49:57] eternal all of his eternals
[50:04] was with him at the beginning his
[50:07] thoughts his attributes and they are
[50:09] only expressing themselves
[50:11] in the world today amen
[50:15] so we come to a place and we look and we
[50:17] see that
[50:19] we as believers and i don't want to say
[50:21] even message believers bible believers
[50:26] everything has got to come from this
[50:28] bible
[50:29] you can't take you know james dobson's a
[50:32] good guy and
[50:33] all dave ramsey and all these different
[50:35] christian men that are
[50:36] um max locato no they're they're good
[50:40] they're good for the nominal world but
[50:42] they do nothing for me
[50:44] you and i have been called to take what
[50:46] not be a baby anymore
[50:48] we're supposed to take it and bring it
[50:49] on up to right here so we're
[50:51] supposed to take what the bible says
[50:53] listen to a good bible preacher
[50:57] if you don't go to a church where they
[50:58] don't read about where they just read
[51:00] quotes
[51:00] or read from so and so bear get away
[51:03] from them
[51:04] that's why we read the bible it's like
[51:07] brother dale said 90
[51:09] of the time listen to me
[51:12] wake up 90
[51:15] of the time jesus was quoting the old
[51:18] testament
[51:19] right 90 460 scriptures were fulfilled
[51:24] at calvary from the old testament jesus
[51:27] was quoting
[51:28] paul was even quoting when paul would
[51:30] say something
[51:32] it would be quoted from the old
[51:33] testament amen
[51:35] all right is that okay that's okay that
[51:37] jesus can do that right
[51:39] and then now we come down to paul paul
[51:42] takes and quotes the old testament
[51:45] all right and he brings it up and says
[51:48] you'll be judged by what i say
[51:53] but we go back in the old testament
[51:58] and they said no i don't think that's
[51:59] right
[52:01] who are you
[52:04] but william branham 90 of the time was
[52:07] quoting bible
[52:09] whatever he was saying had a bible
[52:11] background because he was a bible
[52:13] prophet he was not a prophet that just
[52:15] come and just come in and said
[52:16] i'm just this big no he never said
[52:18] nothing about being big or anything
[52:20] he took you to the word of god he
[52:23] pointed you to christ he didn't point
[52:25] you to a theology
[52:26] amen he didn't he pointed you to the
[52:29] truth
[52:29] so we say oh yeah that jesus quoted the
[52:32] old testament yep boys believe that paul
[52:34] quote yep don't believe that yep that's
[52:36] good
[52:36] brother brown praise oh no
[52:41] no but listen paul was quoting the old
[52:44] testament
[52:46] jesus was quoting the old testament this
[52:48] prophet in the end time was quoting old
[52:52] and new testament old and new testament
[52:55] was being quoted
[52:57] and being revealed
[53:01] revealed to us amen
[53:04] everybody okay with that so let's turn
[53:08] to revelations
[53:09] six i know we read the seals
[53:12] not too long ago in in this series but i
[53:15] want to take it in a little bit
[53:16] different angle
[53:20] because as we said before there's been
[53:22] brides brides churches but there's been
[53:25] a bride in every church age we look in
[53:29] revelations 3 and we see
[53:30] revelations 2 and 3 he says unto the
[53:33] angel of the church of
[53:36] ephesus so what's an angel a messenger
[53:38] that would be paul
[53:40] then you got to the angel of church and
[53:42] smyrna right that was irenaeus
[53:44] and we saw where the prophet put these
[53:46] together by the holy spirit i believe
[53:49] to where each age corresponded with
[53:52] their church age messenger
[53:54] and with a characteristic of what
[53:55] happened in that church age
[53:57] that okay with that we all right with
[53:59] that amen
[54:00] okay but we see that
[54:04] the book of revelations to psalm is a
[54:08] mysterious book
[54:11] and it's become a little more mysterious
[54:16] as man has been putting in their own
[54:18] ideas
[54:20] because as we see that there's a lot of
[54:22] times and thank god that he sent us
[54:23] a prophet how many times do i need to
[54:26] say that because when we look at this
[54:28] and we say how can the bride be in
[54:30] heaven
[54:30] the church be on earth and jesus coming
[54:33] on a white horse
[54:35] well god sent us a prophet to say hey
[54:37] there's a difference in a bride
[54:39] and a church this is a remnant
[54:42] this is the true shirt amen
[54:45] and then you look at it though and you
[54:47] know what you do just like hate it right
[54:49] you say that ain't nothing but the truth
[54:52] it can't be no other way than that
[54:56] but you've been taught a different way
[54:57] because you know what a lot of you came
[54:58] up through denominations that you
[55:00] swore by your eternal
[55:03] life you thought you had or had
[55:06] that father son holy ghost was a way to
[55:08] baptize
[55:13] amen hello
[55:16] and then a trinity
[55:19] right was three persons in a godhead
[55:23] that's right you can't have three
[55:25] persons and have just one
[55:28] amen but you swore by
[55:31] yeah i say you because you know what i
[55:33] went to the church of wade dale for
[55:34] about 20 years
[55:36] which was whatever happened happened but
[55:38] i knew the message was right so i didn't
[55:40] grow up
[55:40] believing the father son holy ghost and
[55:42] all these different things
[55:45] i knew god wasn't that confused and
[55:48] that's what you got to put your
[55:48] confidence in that god's not confused
[55:51] but he is going he he's not confused and
[55:53] he will put you somewhere
[55:55] to not be confused amen
[55:58] please if you're confused here you need
[55:59] to ask questions because we try to make
[56:01] it just as plain as we can make it
[56:03] right amen but this book of revelations
[56:06] 6 verse 1 it wasn't taught by paul
[56:11] paul was already passed on to the other
[56:13] side when this was written
[56:16] but paul said grievous wolves will come
[56:18] and we're going to read in second
[56:19] thessalonians
[56:21] paul says now we beseech thee brethren
[56:22] by the coming of the lord
[56:24] don't be shaken in mind we're going to
[56:26] read it so don't don't turn to it
[56:29] that man of sin must first be revealed
[56:32] the son of perdition paul is prophesying
[56:35] that there'll be a group of people
[56:37] that's going to expose the devil
[56:40] but see he didn't expose him all the way
[56:42] he was down here in the first
[56:44] church age all these other
[56:45] characteristics of god had to come out
[56:48] in these church ages but right there in
[56:51] revelation 6 verse 1 through 8
[56:53] there was many commentaries on that
[56:56] scripture
[56:57] there was clarence larkin and all the
[56:59] different ones
[57:00] and the armenians had a different way
[57:02] and the baptists see it a different way
[57:04] and the presbyterians see it a different
[57:06] way
[57:08] and a lot of message believers see it a
[57:10] different way
[57:12] listen there's not just confusion out
[57:14] there but
[57:16] but what happened in 1963 god eventually
[57:19] sent us a vindicated prophet to show us
[57:22] because listen
[57:25] we were taught
[57:28] many commentators said that that right
[57:31] there
[57:32] i saw let's read it right here when a
[57:34] lamb opened one of the seals and i heard
[57:36] it was the noise of thunder one of the
[57:38] four beasts now they didn't have a clue
[57:39] who the four beasts were
[57:40] right
[57:44] but we know who they are saying come and
[57:46] see and i saw him behold a white horse
[57:47] oh beautiful
[57:50] beautiful white horse not dirty
[57:53] pure beautiful white oh man
[57:57] and there was a guy sitting on top on it
[57:59] oh with a bow
[58:00] oh he was going to conquer that's what
[58:02] the bible says
[58:03] right so most commentators said well
[58:06] that's the holy ghost riding down
[58:07] through the church ages
[58:08] conquering brother branham and mighty
[58:10] conqueror in 1957 and 1959 he preached
[58:14] that scripture as the white horse rider
[58:18] and the one sitting on was the holy
[58:19] ghost riding through the church ages
[58:23] but when he come to the revelation where
[58:25] god said hey
[58:29] i'm done with this i'm done with this
[58:32] confusion
[58:33] i'm done with all this uh you brother
[58:36] branham you've preached
[58:37] from 1947 to 1963 and you brought them
[58:41] back
[58:41] to at least some people are believing
[58:43] that water baptism in the lord jesus
[58:45] christ is correct
[58:46] that there is no such thing as a trinity
[58:49] that there is no such thing as an
[58:50] eternal hell because you'd have to be
[58:51] eternal to be in hell and there's only
[58:52] one form of eternal life and that's
[58:54] god and god ain't in hell for an
[58:57] eternity
[58:58] no so the hell was created for the devil
[59:01] and his angels now they're gonna burn
[59:02] for whatever time but it doesn't matter
[59:04] we're not going to be there amen
[59:09] so but now how many come through
[59:11] denominations and now they'll preach you
[59:13] the hell's eternal and you don't want to
[59:15] go to an eternal burning hell i've heard
[59:18] it preached
[59:19] like daddy says take in fry you over
[59:21] hell like a weenie
[59:23] oh if you don't come hell your mama got
[59:25] saved right like this you know you
[59:27] understand what i mean
[59:28] tradition we don't want tradition
[59:33] we want truth
[59:37] and i saw him behold a white horse and
[59:39] he had selling him had a bow and the
[59:40] crown was given to him and he went forth
[59:41] conquering him to conquer man that
[59:42] sounded like a pretty good guy
[59:44] brother donnie's a white horse it's a
[59:45] man he's got a bow in his hand looks
[59:47] like he's got a little bit of power
[59:49] huh and he's going forth
[59:53] conquering and to conquer and we think
[59:55] wow that's beautiful
[59:57] but the prophet of god was sitting in
[59:59] that room and that angel came to him
[1:00:02] and said
[1:00:05] that's not what that is
[1:00:08] that's not me in other words that's not
[1:00:12] god has nothing to do with god
[1:00:16] that's the opposite guy
[1:00:20] brother brown said i'd have made a
[1:00:21] horrible mistake because he had wrote
[1:00:22] notes
[1:00:23] to preach that the white horse rider was
[1:00:25] the holy ghost god said nope had enough
[1:00:27] of that i'm done with it
[1:00:29] this is the revelation i'll read it to
[1:00:30] you right here let's read number three
[1:00:32] before we go back to revelation 6.
[1:00:34] number three in the first seal they said
[1:00:36] now here's a white horse and a white
[1:00:37] horse is a power a charger
[1:00:39] and said the man that sat on him was the
[1:00:41] white horse was the holy ghost that went
[1:00:43] forth in the early age and conquered
[1:00:45] that age for the kingdom of god he had a
[1:00:47] bow in his hand which meant like cupid
[1:00:49] he shot the arrows but remember he had
[1:00:51] no arrows
[1:00:53] never in there wake up never in there
[1:00:58] did he have an arrow but see that was
[1:01:00] that was
[1:01:01] that was hid that was hid
[1:01:04] because look shot the arrows of love
[1:01:06] into the hearts of the people the love
[1:01:08] of god and he conquered now that sounds
[1:01:09] good
[1:01:11] right sounds all right it sounds all
[1:01:14] right
[1:01:16] now that sounds very good but it isn't
[1:01:17] the truth
[1:01:19] no sir it doesn't white does mean
[1:01:21] righteous
[1:01:22] we realize that white means righteous
[1:01:25] the teacher taught it that it was the
[1:01:27] holy spirit conquering in the first age
[1:01:29] but my revelation of it by the holy
[1:01:31] spirit is not that way
[1:01:33] whoa that's why brother ray went from
[1:01:36] preaching to 25
[1:01:38] 000 people to 20 because they did not
[1:01:41] believe what he was saying
[1:01:42] but it was it come down to the truth not
[1:01:45] a truth it was the truth
[1:01:47] my revelation by the holy spirit is
[1:01:49] christ and the holy spirit is the
[1:01:51] self-same person
[1:01:52] only in a different form so if here
[1:01:54] stands christ the lamb remember right
[1:01:56] here
[1:01:57] the lamb stands open one of the seals
[1:01:58] here's the lamb
[1:02:00] and there's a nut there's a white horse
[1:02:02] rider and another person gets on that
[1:02:04] horse
[1:02:05] now that's okay if you're a trinitarian
[1:02:07] you can put two or three everywhere
[1:02:08] but when you've got one god which is the
[1:02:11] lamb which is jesus christ
[1:02:14] fixing to reveal something to you and
[1:02:16] there goes something away from you
[1:02:22] so here stands christ the lamb we know
[1:02:24] he was the lamb he's standing here with
[1:02:26] the books in his hands what the bible
[1:02:28] says
[1:02:28] and i saw the lamb when he had opened
[1:02:29] one of the seals which was in the book
[1:02:31] and there goes the white horse rider see
[1:02:34] so it wasn't the holy spirit
[1:02:36] now that's one of the mysteries i love
[1:02:39] this right here
[1:02:39] that's one of the mysteries of the last
[1:02:41] day how that christ can be
[1:02:43] the three persons in one it's not three
[1:02:45] different people father son holy ghost
[1:02:46] being three gods
[1:02:47] as the trinitarians try to tell us it's
[1:02:50] three manifestations of the same person
[1:02:52] or you might call it three offices so
[1:02:55] now let's let's get back to this
[1:02:56] to save time go down to the very bottom
[1:03:00] right there so how could christ be out
[1:03:03] there on a horse
[1:03:04] and be standing here with a book in his
[1:03:06] hand now that just makes all kind of
[1:03:08] good sense doesn't it
[1:03:11] but all during the year years of the
[1:03:13] church ages
[1:03:16] they thought that was the same person
[1:03:19] but it's not here stands a lamb with a
[1:03:24] book in his hand
[1:03:26] and they're out there with a white horse
[1:03:28] conquering and standing here with a book
[1:03:30] in his hand
[1:03:30] it isn't so it isn't christ and i bet
[1:03:34] them theologians their eyes rolled back
[1:03:36] in their head and they got dizzy
[1:03:38] they said what do you mean but you know
[1:03:41] what
[1:03:41] you keep reading and you put scripture
[1:03:44] together with scripture
[1:03:46] and you get out of that trinitarian idea
[1:03:48] that there's three people running around
[1:03:49] here
[1:03:51] and you'll see that if if there's two
[1:03:53] people remember how many spirits did i
[1:03:54] tell you there were
[1:03:56] two not three plus one
[1:04:00] amen not father son holy ghost and and
[1:04:03] evil or
[1:04:04] lucifer nope there's one god and there's
[1:04:07] one devil
[1:04:09] now if here stands a lamb with a book in
[1:04:10] his hand and there goes a person on a
[1:04:13] horse
[1:04:14] who is that person that person is not
[1:04:18] christ
[1:04:18] that's the devil because now look he has
[1:04:22] no boat
[1:04:22] we know he went through the first seal
[1:04:24] he went through and and you need to read
[1:04:26] seal book again maybe
[1:04:28] but here stands a lamb with the book of
[1:04:30] hand there goes the white horse rider
[1:04:31] what
[1:04:32] he conquered by his doctrine
[1:04:35] because through the first three church
[1:04:37] ages he was
[1:04:39] that little foxes that spoiled the vine
[1:04:41] he was that grievous wolf has crept in
[1:04:48] denominations there was no denomination
[1:04:51] until this church age right here but the
[1:04:54] makings of it
[1:04:56] was right here baby form as christ
[1:04:58] started in a baby form
[1:05:00] so does satan starting to babyform and
[1:05:02] they rode together
[1:05:05] because you know what but you turn over
[1:05:07] to revelations 19 and you see a man
[1:05:10] on a white horse
[1:05:14] riding with a group of people into the
[1:05:17] millennium
[1:05:19] right and he's got one thing that that
[1:05:22] white horse in revelation 6 that white
[1:05:25] horse rider didn't have the word of god
[1:05:28] printed right here
[1:05:31] you and i are the manifestation of that
[1:05:34] word of god because
[1:05:35] we're right behind him amen amen
[1:05:38] oh brother wade i can't ride a horse you
[1:05:40] will then
[1:05:48] don't be scared a little bright it's all
[1:05:49] been figured out for you if you'll just
[1:05:51] quit figuring it out for yourself
[1:05:53] amen
[1:05:57] second thessalonians let's read
[1:06:00] everybody with me say amen amen oh i'm
[1:06:03] sorry we got to go back to
[1:06:06] go back to revelation 6. sorry
[1:06:10] go get it brother anderson you good and
[1:06:12] i saw the lamb open one of the seals and
[1:06:14] i heard it were the noise of thunder and
[1:06:15] one of the four beasts says come and see
[1:06:17] now we know who the four
[1:06:18] beasts were in ezekiel it tells us it's
[1:06:20] the lion the ox the man and the eagle
[1:06:22] which is what
[1:06:23] the holy ghost the characteristics of
[1:06:25] the holy ghost right
[1:06:27] the light boldness of the line the some
[1:06:30] of y'all coming to church
[1:06:31] and can't keep your eyes open
[1:06:35] that's the ox trying to get it do its
[1:06:37] work
[1:06:39] the shrewdness of a man it's not you
[1:06:41] know what it
[1:06:42] that right there that uh knowledge is
[1:06:45] not
[1:06:45] knowledge of satan and that's not
[1:06:48] knowledge to do algebra
[1:06:50] that's knowledge to know whether what
[1:06:51] i'm telling you is the truth or not
[1:06:55] that's holy ghost knowledge
[1:07:00] then the linox man and the eagle now
[1:07:01] what is the eagle anointing which is
[1:07:03] what we're living under now an eagle
[1:07:04] goes higher and further
[1:07:06] yes that's right amen all right you
[1:07:08] ready and i saw him behold a white horse
[1:07:10] and he said on him had a bow
[1:07:12] and a crown was given unto him and he
[1:07:13] got forth conquering the crown was given
[1:07:15] something had to be given to him
[1:07:19] and he went forth conquering him to
[1:07:20] conquer now watch
[1:07:22] and when he had opened the second seal i
[1:07:24] heard the second beast say
[1:07:26] come and see and there without another
[1:07:28] horse now look
[1:07:29] another horse but not another writer
[1:07:31] right many commentators
[1:07:33] when you look at the four beasts of the
[1:07:35] four
[1:07:36] um sorry the four horse riders of the
[1:07:38] book of revelations
[1:07:39] how many of you have seen that picture
[1:07:42] it's four different people
[1:07:43] sitting on four different horses that
[1:07:45] wasn't true
[1:07:46] brother brown said he got off of this
[1:07:48] power or this horse
[1:07:49] climbed up on another horse same person
[1:07:54] thank god for that they want another
[1:07:56] horse that was red and power was given
[1:07:58] to him that sat there on to take peace
[1:08:00] from the earth
[1:08:00] that they should kill one another and
[1:08:02] there was given to him a great sword
[1:08:03] what
[1:08:04] a sword is a word so that red age or
[1:08:08] that red columba right here where 68
[1:08:10] million
[1:08:11] people were killed christians were
[1:08:13] killed why
[1:08:15] because of what they believed
[1:08:18] they wasn't killed because they didn't
[1:08:20] look good they weren't part of a
[1:08:22] no they didn't believe what the catholic
[1:08:24] church has instituted
[1:08:26] right in the beginning of denominations
[1:08:28] amen
[1:08:33] when he had opened the third seal i
[1:08:34] heard the third third beast say come and
[1:08:36] see
[1:08:37] and i'll be held a little black horse
[1:08:39] and he that sat on him had a pair of
[1:08:40] balances in his hand now remember that
[1:08:42] we know that's the catholic church and
[1:08:44] all the different ones paying
[1:08:45] novenas a measure of wheat for a penny
[1:08:47] and three measures of barley for a penny
[1:08:48] see though not hurt the oil
[1:08:51] and the wine and when he had opened the
[1:08:53] fourth seal let's get to it real quick
[1:08:54] and then we'll be
[1:08:55] we'll read the rest of this on ii
[1:08:57] thessalonians i looked to behold a pale
[1:08:59] horse and his name that said on him was
[1:09:00] death
[1:09:03] remember he was death to begin with he
[1:09:06] just didn't have a name yet
[1:09:08] but see when we had a prophet of god
[1:09:12] come
[1:09:13] and expose satan by the false doctrine
[1:09:16] that men have put in the bible
[1:09:18] because the bible's not false
[1:09:21] but what man has put in the bible to say
[1:09:24] that this is true
[1:09:26] and this is false it exposed satan
[1:09:32] it showed us where he was at and what he
[1:09:35] was doing
[1:09:36] amen and it wasn't that brother branham
[1:09:39] had to get a revelation that he was out
[1:09:41] there in the bar
[1:09:44] he got a revelation he was sitting that
[1:09:46] he was in that church
[1:09:49] and he was religious
[1:09:53] and i looked and behold a pale horse and
[1:09:54] his name it said on him was death and
[1:09:56] hell followed with him and power was
[1:09:57] given unto them over the fourth part of
[1:09:58] the earth
[1:09:59] to kill was sword now not sword
[1:10:03] they killed with the word
[1:10:07] and with hunger what starving the people
[1:10:09] from listening to the word of god
[1:10:11] and with death what spiritual death is
[1:10:13] way worse than natural death
[1:10:15] and with the beast of the earth which
[1:10:17] would be all the other that's what we
[1:10:19] have to put up with
[1:10:20] amen so now let's read second
[1:10:22] thessalonians i know part of it's here
[1:10:24] but some of you they have this let's go
[1:10:26] to the last one and read the whole
[1:10:28] ver from 1 through 12.
[1:10:32] and go to the go past that one brother
[1:10:36] anderson and go to the one i gave you in
[1:10:38] the back
[1:10:39] back here because it's got more
[1:10:40] scripture we're reading from 1 to 12
[1:10:43] 1 verse 1 to verse 12.
[1:10:46] there we go now look that word up
[1:10:49] besiege
[1:10:51] now i beseech thee brethren this is paul
[1:10:54] paul says i beseech thee brethren listen
[1:10:58] to what i'm saying
[1:11:01] actually besiege means to beg
[1:11:05] i'm begging you to listen to what i'm
[1:11:08] saying
[1:11:09] paul says now we beseech you brethren by
[1:11:11] the coming of our lord jesus christ and
[1:11:13] by our gathering together unto him
[1:11:15] everybody believed paul was a prophet
[1:11:16] right
[1:11:17] okay that you be not soon
[1:11:21] shaken in mind or be troubled neither by
[1:11:23] spirit
[1:11:24] nor by word nor by letter as from us
[1:11:27] as that day of christ is at hand now not
[1:11:30] a 24-hour day
[1:11:33] now watch let no man deceive you by any
[1:11:36] means
[1:11:37] for that day shall not come
[1:11:40] except there come a falling away first
[1:11:43] right and we see that happening now
[1:11:46] and that man of sin be revealed
[1:11:50] the son of perdition but where is he
[1:11:54] who opposes and exalteth himself above
[1:11:58] all that is called god
[1:12:02] or that is worshipped yes
[1:12:05] so that he has god sitteth in the white
[1:12:10] temple of god
[1:12:14] showing himself that he is god
[1:12:19] oh my back in ezekiel it talks about
[1:12:23] the king of tyrus oh king of tyrus
[1:12:27] you're
[1:12:27] you're a great guy you've walked up and
[1:12:29] down in eden you've done all these great
[1:12:30] things
[1:12:33] but you come down to right here you got
[1:12:36] a man
[1:12:38] that might have been a baby for but you
[1:12:39] got a man standing here
[1:12:42] because remember when this first seal
[1:12:44] breaks in its natural form we're not
[1:12:46] here
[1:12:47] the man of sin is going to have to swhat
[1:12:50] the mystery of iniquity
[1:12:51] has got to be made known to us but what
[1:12:53] it does it makes the
[1:12:55] mystery of iniquity what's iniquity
[1:12:57] knowing to do better
[1:12:59] and don't do it or doing something you
[1:13:01] know you shouldn't do because the bible
[1:13:02] tells you look you look read it right
[1:13:04] there in the bible and you say well i
[1:13:05] don't believe i can do that
[1:13:07] that's the mystery of iniquity iniquity
[1:13:10] is being told now that's not being
[1:13:12] ignorant
[1:13:13] right ignorant is you just don't know
[1:13:16] you've never been taught big difference
[1:13:20] in that
[1:13:20] right and iniquity
[1:13:24] that's why i'm i believe the first seal
[1:13:27] was the most important seal because if
[1:13:30] it wasn't open to that problem if he
[1:13:31] would have stepped up in that pulpit
[1:13:33] and preached that the white horse rider
[1:13:35] was
[1:13:36] christ riding on a white horse he would
[1:13:39] have exalted satan to that position
[1:13:41] right there
[1:13:44] but god wouldn't let it happen thank god
[1:13:48] he takes care of his word
[1:13:50] he wouldn't let it happen he said no he
[1:13:53] said that thing riding out there he said
[1:13:55] that's the devil
[1:13:58] and you better watch him because he was
[1:14:00] right here at one time
[1:14:05] who opposes and exalted himself above
[1:14:07] all that is called god
[1:14:09] or that is worship though so he as god
[1:14:13] sitteth in the temple of god showing
[1:14:15] himself that he is god
[1:14:18] not like him is god
[1:14:23] remember you not that when i was yet
[1:14:25] with you
[1:14:26] i told you these things and now
[1:14:29] ye know what withholded
[1:14:32] that he about be revealed in his time
[1:14:35] you know what was withholded
[1:14:37] me and you paul was down here in the
[1:14:40] first church age he knew there was more
[1:14:42] people to come all up through here right
[1:14:45] and the mystery of iniquity would not be
[1:14:47] revealed down here and be revealed here
[1:14:49] because why
[1:14:50] it's the faithful and true witness
[1:14:53] the beginning of the creation of god
[1:14:57] and now you know what withholdeth that
[1:14:59] he might be revealed in his time
[1:15:01] for the mystery of iniquity does all
[1:15:05] ready work two thousand years it's had
[1:15:08] to perfect itself
[1:15:10] only he who now letteth will let
[1:15:13] we know who that is god until he the
[1:15:16] bride
[1:15:17] be taken out of the way so the mystery
[1:15:19] of iniquity
[1:15:20] satan is not going to incarnate the pope
[1:15:22] or whoever you want to think it is
[1:15:24] until we get out of here then he's going
[1:15:27] to
[1:15:27] say i'm not like god he's going to say
[1:15:30] god's here wow
[1:15:35] in the whole world
[1:15:40] the whole world except even a little
[1:15:42] remnant of the
[1:15:43] of the five foolish virgins
[1:15:47] are gonna take it and swallow it up and
[1:15:50] say we finally found the great man
[1:15:52] right whole world but there's 144 000
[1:15:56] going to look at him
[1:15:58] and there's two witnesses that's going
[1:16:00] to preach to him
[1:16:01] and 144 000 is going to believe who he
[1:16:04] really is
[1:16:06] that that satan incarnate but the whole
[1:16:10] world
[1:16:12] is going to say see look what does the
[1:16:14] whole world need right now
[1:16:17] what does the whole world need right now
[1:16:19] they need a savior
[1:16:21] they need somebody to step on the scene
[1:16:23] and say i got the answer
[1:16:26] i'll fix your economy i'll make sure
[1:16:28] everybody gets the vaccine i'll make
[1:16:30] sure this i'll make sure that
[1:16:31] why we not heard from the catholic
[1:16:33] church for a while from the pope
[1:16:36] he's working don't worry
[1:16:40] he's working because he's going to have
[1:16:43] to do some things
[1:16:45] before he's revealed to the world but we
[1:16:48] know
[1:16:49] right and like i said before it's not
[1:16:50] the one person it's satan
[1:16:53] it's the devil doing these things for
[1:16:54] the mystery of iniquity death already
[1:16:55] worked
[1:16:56] only he who now led us we'll let what
[1:16:58] god's going to let it happen
[1:17:00] until he the bride be taken out of the
[1:17:01] way and then
[1:17:03] shall that wicked one be revealed whom
[1:17:06] the lord shall consume with the spirit
[1:17:07] of his mouth and shall destroy with the
[1:17:09] brightness of his coming
[1:17:10] what not in the world in me and you
[1:17:14] right here this temple i don't want that
[1:17:17] thing sitting in my temple
[1:17:20] showing himself that he is god listen if
[1:17:22] you don't worship the lord jesus christ
[1:17:25] you are worshiping satan
[1:17:28] remember there's only two i worshiped
[1:17:32] the devil
[1:17:32] all them years
[1:17:37] didn't you
[1:17:40] but now what's moved from then till now
[1:17:45] now he's moved into the church and said
[1:17:47] hey everything's okay
[1:17:49] you feel you when brother louise sang
[1:17:51] that song you went whoo
[1:17:52] oh lord i know you hear that that chill
[1:17:55] went up my spine
[1:17:59] and i'll promise you one thing the devil
[1:18:02] don't sleep in church
[1:18:06] he might make you but he don't sleep in
[1:18:08] church
[1:18:09] he's got his eyes and his ears trained
[1:18:11] on me and you
[1:18:14] and he's waiting on us to slip up listen
[1:18:17] we
[1:18:17] cannot fail somebody's got to expose the
[1:18:22] devil
[1:18:23] and show him that we are god incarnate
[1:18:26] as he wants to incarnate a man god
[1:18:29] himself has incarnated his bride
[1:18:35] but we've got to look at this folks and
[1:18:37] see the separation
[1:18:39] we've got to see that you have a lamb
[1:18:41] inside of you and there goes all those
[1:18:43] things all those ideas all those
[1:18:44] different things
[1:18:45] all those different doctrines that you
[1:18:47] used to have they got to go away from
[1:18:49] you
[1:18:50] you can't live with them that's right
[1:18:53] god won't dwell in an unclean vessel for
[1:18:56] the mystery of iniquitous already worked
[1:18:58] oh really
[1:18:58] and then shall that wicked one be
[1:19:01] revealed
[1:19:02] whom the lord shall consume with the
[1:19:03] spirit of his mouth what the word
[1:19:06] and shall destroy with the brightness of
[1:19:08] his coming
[1:19:09] even him whose coming is after the
[1:19:12] working of satan with all power
[1:19:14] and signs and lying wonders
[1:19:19] it wouldn't surprise me a bit
[1:19:22] if the pope walks in and says we've had
[1:19:24] 5 000 people healed from this virus
[1:19:28] and prove it what are we going to do
[1:19:30] about it
[1:19:31] the whole world is going to be deceived
[1:19:33] by it and they're going to go
[1:19:35] okay we find the man you understand what
[1:19:37] i mean
[1:19:38] he's not going to be some mean something
[1:19:40] that's going to come in bible said he
[1:19:41] come in with what
[1:19:42] flattery comes in with flattery
[1:19:45] he comes in real easy real deceptive
[1:19:51] even him whose coming is after the
[1:19:52] working of satan with all power and
[1:19:53] signs and lying wonders
[1:19:55] and with all deceivableness
[1:19:58] of unrighteousness in them that perish
[1:20:02] because what it didn't it didn't they
[1:20:05] didn't
[1:20:06] if they did it wasn't that they didn't
[1:20:07] receive the truth
[1:20:09] they didn't receive the knowledge of the
[1:20:10] truth or the love of the truth
[1:20:13] because they received not the love
[1:20:16] of the truth what is love the holy ghost
[1:20:18] charity
[1:20:19] that they might be saved for this cause
[1:20:22] god shall send them
[1:20:24] strong delusion
[1:20:28] you say god's going to purposely blind
[1:20:29] these people no he's going to give them
[1:20:31] a choice
[1:20:32] and once they make their choice he's
[1:20:33] going to give them a strong delusion
[1:20:35] that they should believe a lie
[1:20:40] that they all might be damned who
[1:20:42] believed not the truth but had pleasure
[1:20:45] in unrighteousness wow wow
[1:20:52] but when god come to the end time
[1:20:56] musicians come when god come to the end
[1:20:58] time
[1:21:00] he said i've saved the best for last
[1:21:02] because it's going to be the worst
[1:21:05] i'm going to send him the truth
[1:21:09] and you're either going to turn it down
[1:21:11] or you're going to accept it
[1:21:14] you got to make that choice
[1:21:17] if you see something in the word of god
[1:21:19] and it looks kind of strange to you
[1:21:21] search out the rest of the word of god
[1:21:23] amen search it all
[1:21:25] out search it out where where you
[1:21:29] don't go well my church says i don't
[1:21:31] really care what your church says
[1:21:33] i don't really care what this church
[1:21:35] says right
[1:21:36] it's what the word says it's what the
[1:21:39] truth said what did it say
[1:21:40] it said well let's read it i'll read it
[1:21:43] for you
[1:21:46] hold on just a minute i got it right
[1:21:48] here don't pull it up i got it right
[1:21:49] here

[1:21:51] i'll get it for him
[1:21:54] okay
[1:22:05] he's an anthony
[1:22:10] every church age ends with this it has
[1:22:12] the different things that go through but
[1:22:14] it ends every one of them right here he
[1:22:17] that has an ear
[1:22:18] right let him hear what the spirit
[1:22:23] not the letter not the church
[1:22:26] what the spirit saith to the churches
[1:22:33] and if you're if you're
[1:22:36] prophet paul irenaeus martin different
[1:22:37] ones all the ones if they preach the
[1:22:39] truth then they're preaching christ
[1:22:43] and they're bringing you out of
[1:22:44] something revelation 19 says come out of
[1:22:47] her
[1:22:50] you got that come out of her my people
[1:22:53] what is her
[1:22:54] a church come out of her
[1:22:57] my people now let's get the her out of
[1:23:00] us
[1:23:02] hey man it's okay to switch
[1:23:06] doors switch churches
[1:23:09] but like daddy said he said don't bring
[1:23:11] that church
[1:23:13] with you in here
[1:23:16] all you're doing is changing a different
[1:23:17] place you hang your hat and your coat
[1:23:22] god will give he'll change you
[1:23:24] revolution they can
[1:23:26] the world can give you anything in the
[1:23:28] world the world can give you whatever
[1:23:30] the world can give you
[1:23:31] but he can't give you they can't give
[1:23:33] you eternal life
[1:23:35] they cannot give you the truth
[1:23:39] they can talk about a truth they can
[1:23:40] talk about this they care about that
[1:23:42] but this is the way jesus said i am the
[1:23:44] way the truth and the life
[1:23:46] and today i've preached christ to you
[1:23:49] not a well we believe in a man we
[1:23:52] believe god sent a messenger
[1:23:54] didn't god send paul didn't god send
[1:23:57] peter
[1:23:59] didn't god send all those 12 apostles
[1:24:01] out into the world
[1:24:02] to do what preach the gospel
[1:24:05] why can't we believe that god uses man
[1:24:08] he used one today i hope and pray
[1:24:12] amen i'm praying that god
[1:24:17] will use you and me
[1:24:21] there's no look there's no big eyes and
[1:24:23] no little use there's no big ones among
[1:24:25] us
[1:24:25] i like what brother claude says he said
[1:24:27] we're just a servant
[1:24:29] a preacher can only preach what the
[1:24:30] congregation wants him to preach
