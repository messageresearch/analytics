[3:44] watching god move in the storm
[3:47] and the rainbow and all that and he said
[3:49] that's all i've seen for 40 years
[3:51] is god
[3:53] and it's amazing people walk right past
[3:56] it
[3:58] and discount it right
[4:02] but
[4:04] god's in our midst glory
[4:08] because
[4:09] he's in each one
[4:11] because you're the representation of
[4:13] jesus christ the manifestation of jesus
[4:15] christ in this last day right
[4:18] so
[4:19] let's just uh look under the scripture
[4:22] we'll be reading from colossians 1

[4:36] i'm all
[4:38] i i enjoyed what brothel had to say
[4:40] yesterday and and the minister's meeting
[4:43] up and i pulled a few quotes out of it
[4:46] and uh
[4:48] so y'all just pray for me
[4:50] it's it's completely jumbled
[4:52] so it's going to take the lord
[4:54] to make this thing work
[4:57] but uh
[4:58] you know i don't i don't trust in
[5:00] anything that i can do it's all what he
[5:02] can do

[6:54] verse 21
[6:56] it says and you that were sometimes
[6:59] alienated and enemies in your mind by
[7:03] wicked works yet now
[7:04] hath he reconciled in the body of his
[7:07] flesh through death to present you holy
[7:10] and unblameable and unreprovable in his
[7:12] sight
[7:14] if you continue in the faith grounded
[7:16] and settled and be not moved away from
[7:19] the hope of the gospel which ye have
[7:21] heard and which was preached to every
[7:23] creature which is under heaven whereof i
[7:26] paul and made a minister who now rejoice
[7:29] in my sufferings for you and fill up
[7:32] that which is behind of the afflictions
[7:35] of christ and my flesh for his body sake
[7:38] which is the church
[7:39] whereof i am made a minister according
[7:42] to the dispensation dispensation of god
[7:45] which is given to me for you to fulfill
[7:48] the word of god even the mystery which
[7:50] hath been hid from ages and from
[7:52] generations but now is made manifest to
[7:54] his saints to whom god would make known
[7:57] what is the riches of
[7:59] the glory of his mystery among the
[8:01] gentiles which is christ in you the hope
[8:03] of glory whom we preach warning every
[8:05] man and teaching every man in all wisdom
[8:08] that we may present every man perfect in
[8:10] christ jesus whereunto i also labor
[8:13] striving according to his working which
[8:16] worketh in me mightily right now we go
[8:19] to romans
[8:21] chapter 16 verses 25 and 26
[8:24] now he says now to him that is of power
[8:27] to establish you according to my gospel
[8:30] and the preaching of jesus christ
[8:31] according to the revelation of the
[8:33] mystery which was kept secret since the
[8:35] world began
[8:37] but now is made manifest and by the
[8:39] scriptures of the prophets according to
[8:40] the commandment of the everlasting god
[8:43] made known to all nations
[8:45] for the obedience of faith amen amen
[8:48] lord add his blessing to the reading of
[8:50] words you may be seated
[8:53] see
[8:55] i uh
[9:02] found out yesterday i was going to be
[9:03] speaking today so
[9:06] i i was at home
[9:08] done a little
[9:10] i was just doing studying
[9:12] praying just
[9:14] trying to find what
[9:16] the lord having me say and
[9:18] looking over some things and
[9:23] i found out that uh looking back it's
[9:26] been
[9:27] today's been it makes 17 years
[9:30] since i since i preached my first sermon
[9:34] 17 years on a sunday evening
[9:42] and
[9:43] just say it's all all by the grace of
[9:45] god
[9:47] and if
[9:49] and if i and if i'd
[9:52] do anything
[9:56] it's not been me it's been him
[9:58] i give him all the glory and the honor
[10:00] for it
[10:02] and uh
[10:08] y'all just pray for me
[10:09] but you know sometimes we look at we
[10:11] look at things in life on
[10:13] and we wonder
[10:15] why things happen the way they do yeah
[10:19] and you know
[10:21] we can say life comes with it doesn't
[10:23] come with an instruction manual
[10:26] but we have the scriptures right
[10:30] and and things don't make sense to us
[10:32] and things don't work out the way we
[10:33] want them to
[10:34] but we know
[10:36] paul said in romans
[10:38] for all things work together for the
[10:40] good
[10:41] to them that love the lord
[10:43] who are they called according to his
[10:45] purpose
[10:46] so all the things that happen to us
[10:48] happen for a reason
[10:51] and
[10:52] i don't know if y'all ever heard the
[10:53] little story about the man
[10:55] pushing the rock
[11:00] man had a dream
[11:02] had this huge boulder in front of him
[11:04] and the lord tells him says i want you
[11:05] to push this rock
[11:08] so the man gets out there
[11:10] and day after day he struggles against
[11:12] that rock
[11:13] and he pushes and he pushes and he
[11:15] pushes
[11:17] and he never and he does that every
[11:19] single day and thing never moves but he
[11:22] goes out there every single day he's
[11:23] just pushing pushing pushing pushing
[11:26] just wearing out the ground around it
[11:27] just trying to push that thing
[11:29] and he goes back the next day and he's
[11:31] doing it just keeps on continually
[11:32] pushing on that rock
[11:35] and one day he stops and says lord he
[11:37] said i've been pushing on this rock for
[11:39] so long
[11:40] he said but i've never moved it
[11:44] but the lord said did i ever tell you to
[11:46] move the rock
[11:48] he said i said push the rock
[11:50] he said i never said move the rock
[11:53] but he said i want you to take a look at
[11:55] yourself from where you were
[11:58] he said you were
[12:00] weak
[12:01] and thin he said look at the muscles
[12:03] that you have look at the calluses that
[12:05] you have look at the chains that was
[12:07] made in you
[12:09] see it wasn't that you were supposed to
[12:10] move the rock to change your situation
[12:12] but your situation was given to change
[12:15] you
[12:15] but you overlooked so you did not
[12:17] realize what was taking place that the
[12:19] change was supposed to be made in you
[12:22] and you know that's it
[12:25] i see that sometimes you look and say
[12:27] well why don't things change and you're
[12:29] looking for change
[12:30] sometimes it's not the change in the
[12:32] situation it's the change in you
[12:37] and so that's what
[12:39] i thank the lord for
[12:45] you know i
[12:48] i may not even get to my
[12:50] to my text and not because i don't
[12:52] but uh
[12:54] you know i
[12:59] y'all just y'all just pray for me but
[13:02] you know
[13:03] i had a grandmother
[13:06] that was in brother branham's meetings
[13:07] and
[13:13] you know brother brown said they would
[13:15] be looking over the banister
[13:18] yeah you know from that dimension down
[13:22] right
[13:24] you know
[13:25] one of these days i you know i
[13:27] just pray the lord lets her look over
[13:29] and see
[13:30] right that's right
[13:34] because what i want to be
[13:37] because you know she prayed for us all
[13:39] the time
[13:41] when nobody else held the token my
[13:43] grandmother held a token over us
[13:49] and
[13:50] you know i see what what is
[13:54] what has come
[13:58] you know she done her part and she ran
[14:00] her race
[14:01] now i want to do my part and run my race
[14:04] you know
[14:06] she's over there
[14:10] but somebody's got to call her back
[14:11] somebody's going to call her out of the
[14:13] ground
[14:16] and you know
[14:17] i think brother dale
[14:21] you know he says
[14:23] all them all the different brothers over
[14:24] the years
[14:26] and he said i thank god for each one of
[14:27] them because they helped me
[14:30] and you know exactly
[14:33] i look back
[14:37] over the years of the of the ones that
[14:41] that i
[14:42] that i've been associated with
[14:46] and
[14:50] when i was when i was 21
[14:52] i'd been in the world and
[14:54] it was right after my grandmother had
[14:56] passed
[14:57] and
[14:58] the lord the lord was dealing with me
[15:02] my grandmother grandma gray was laying
[15:03] in the hospital florida
[15:05] and we went down there and we stayed
[15:06] with some some people from the church
[15:10] and the and the lady was
[15:15] and they were just super sweet to us and
[15:19] i was laying on her couch one night and
[15:29] you never you just
[15:31] y'all just pray for me i'm just
[15:34] but
[15:36] you know
[15:38] i knew grandma always prayed for us and
[15:40] every time i got in trouble every time i
[15:42] felt bad i'd call grandma on the phone
[15:45] yeah
[15:47] if i got sick if i needed somebody to
[15:48] talk to i called grandma
[15:52] and you know what because i knew she
[15:54] could reach chavin
[15:57] and
[16:00] i was laying on
[16:01] the sister in florida's couch
[16:04] i was standing there
[16:05] and
[16:07] she had
[16:08] she had the cod books on her on her
[16:11] coffee table there
[16:13] and i reached down and i got one of
[16:15] those
[16:16] one of those books and
[16:20] i tell you
[16:24] i'm sorry people can say whatever
[16:26] whatever they want to
[16:29] and
[16:30] the the
[16:32] people can say whatever they want to
[16:33] about this message
[16:35] i know that it's real
[16:38] you can say whatever you want to about
[16:39] god i know he's real glory amen
[16:43] just like brother tony was preaching
[16:45] wednesday night i'm too far down the
[16:46] road i've seen too much i've experienced
[16:48] too much you could i mean it don't
[16:50] matter i know i know where i stand
[16:53] and when i got a hold of that book and i
[16:55] just started reading
[16:57] and i tell you the lord if i've ever had
[16:59] the lord speak to me i know
[17:01] him speaking to me
[17:04] and you know she was laying in the
[17:05] hospital and they didn't give her much
[17:07] much time to live and i still remember
[17:09] the lord telling
[17:11] they're telling me
[17:13] said you know
[17:15] you've been following your grandmother
[17:17] she's applied the token to you
[17:19] said i want you to come and walk with me
[17:22] right right
[17:24] it's time for you to make your decision
[17:28] and you know i couldn't get away from
[17:29] that we after she had her funeral i just
[17:32] carried that from
[17:33] and i got back to tennessee was living
[17:36] in tennessee and i got back home and i
[17:38] couldn't get away from it then i knelt
[17:40] beside my bed
[17:42] one evening
[17:44] and i said god i can't live like this
[17:50] because there was something
[17:52] that stirred inside of me i couldn't get
[17:54] away from
[17:56] amen and you know i appreciate
[17:59] god
[18:01] and i appreciate him coming
[18:04] and bringing me to the place that i
[18:06] needed to be
[18:11] it's the mercy and grace of god that he
[18:12] calls us
[18:14] he brings us to this place
[18:18] and i
[18:19] the first church that i went to with
[18:20] brother james tibbles and i appreciate
[18:22] brother james
[18:25] if there's one thing brother james ever
[18:26] taught me was
[18:28] one thing
[18:30] that there was going to be a take a
[18:32] five-fold ministry
[18:35] to perfect the body
[18:37] the saints would only be perfected
[18:38] through five four minutes
[18:41] and
[18:42] i've heard
[18:44] you know he had he had a lot not just
[18:45] brother benham's tapes but he had a lot
[18:47] of ministers from the message had their
[18:49] tapes
[18:51] and i've sat down and
[18:52] and
[18:54] the way i know about doctrines in this
[18:56] message as i've i've heard
[18:59] i've heard all kinds of things that's
[19:01] been preached
[19:03] so you know some things is not is is not
[19:05] a hearsay thing i know what people have
[19:08] preached
[19:09] and
[19:11] and i have
[19:12] heard things
[19:16] and i've sit there and held onto things
[19:18] it's like lord i don't understand this
[19:22] and one of the one of the doctrines is
[19:23] the first time
[19:24] that i i ever heard
[19:27] anybody preach on the river jordan it
[19:29] was like something
[19:31] it was like rubbing a cat the wrong way
[19:33] i guess is is one way of expressing it
[19:38] i mean it felt like you know somebody
[19:41] was just it was something was crawling
[19:42] all over me
[19:44] and i sat there and i said lord i don't
[19:46] understand that
[19:47] that don't make any sense
[19:50] but i never could put my my finger on it
[19:54] and i said well lord i'm just going to
[19:55] hold on to that
[19:58] because i know what brother branham said
[20:00] but it said there's something wrong here
[20:02] i can't put my finger on it but for some
[20:04] reason i know what the prophet said
[20:07] but it takes you to come and
[20:10] reveal the scripture right
[20:12] because if it's not you coming then it's
[20:14] not going to make any sense
[20:17] and you know there's other questions
[20:19] that i've had but i had that question
[20:21] and i held it for so long
[20:24] and that was that was years
[20:27] i'm i'm i'm guessing probably three
[20:29] years i held that
[20:32] until i'm until i come to lula
[20:37] until i met brother dale and
[20:39] and
[20:40] and there were other things
[20:42] that
[20:43] i had questions about
[20:47] and all of a sudden just just sitting
[20:48] here and and listening to the scripture
[20:53] see
[20:54] we are so blessed
[20:57] see many people
[20:59] are walking
[21:00] in darkness
[21:02] they're walking in confusion
[21:05] right
[21:05] but you know what it doesn't it's not
[21:07] it's not to elevate a man
[21:10] it's not it's not because we're not here
[21:11] to build a kingdom
[21:14] right because
[21:15] all we're trying to do is get get a a
[21:17] body ready a bride ready to get out of
[21:20] here
[21:22] because you know what all of this we
[21:24] understand all this is satan's eating
[21:26] satan's going to have his dominion and
[21:28] he's going to destroy it he's in the
[21:29] process of it and we understand that
[21:33] a curse is down on america
[21:36] we know we know what the end is going to
[21:38] be
[21:40] so
[21:40] all these things we understand what's
[21:42] going to take place what's going to
[21:44] happen
[21:46] but i i'm more interested in getting out
[21:48] of here
[21:51] and i just i just thank the lord that
[21:54] you know
[21:56] some people have
[21:59] have tried to blind the people
[22:03] and you know they only want you to hear
[22:06] them
[22:08] we got you got preachers that they want
[22:10] to give you their revelation
[22:14] but it's not going to do any good
[22:16] because if it's not a revelation from
[22:17] god it doesn't help anybody
[22:20] it's only it's only because brother
[22:22] brown said it was the holy ghost that
[22:23] was the only divine interpreter of the
[22:25] truth of the rev to reveal the word and
[22:28] if it didn't take the holy ghost to come
[22:30] and reveal the word then it's not any
[22:32] going to do any good
[22:34] and i appreciate i appreciate a pastor
[22:36] that that i had
[22:38] that i was able to listen to learn that
[22:42] he wanted us to to uh to read
[22:46] because the scripture tells us
[22:49] said in the last days it would deceive
[22:51] it would be so close that it would
[22:52] deceive the very elect if possible
[22:55] that's right
[22:56] but you know what he said he wouldn't
[22:57] deceive the election
[23:00] amen so if there's truth out there then
[23:03] you know because as as the scripture
[23:05] says as brother branham was telling us
[23:06] he said if there's a deep
[23:09] that's calling out there's a deep to
[23:10] respond to that
[23:12] and so so there's an opportunity to
[23:15] reach out and we're able to study
[23:17] and listen
[23:20] because a lot of people maybe they just
[23:22] skimmed over those things maybe they
[23:24] just said well that was brother
[23:25] so-and-so who preached that and they
[23:27] just swallowed it hook line and sinker
[23:32] but you know i say it's the grace of god
[23:35] that something stopped me one day
[23:39] that stopped me to that is that what is
[23:41] this
[23:42] because something didn't make sense
[23:46] and then that i was able to have
[23:48] somebody
[23:50] i could have just stuck it on the shelf
[23:51] and i guess ignored it
[23:56] but i had a desire
[23:59] to have have an answer
[24:02] brother brown said if you've got an
[24:03] answer he said he'll put someone in
[24:05] behind the pulpit
[24:07] to give you your answer
[24:09] right right
[24:11] so so there's somebody here
[24:14] that will give you the answer that
[24:16] you're looking for right
[24:18] but you sometimes you may have to hold
[24:20] on for a while
[24:21] you may have to say well lord i don't
[24:23] understand but you know i know what the
[24:26] prophet's message is true
[24:29] but there's one thing about it it takes
[24:31] it takes more than just reading books
[24:34] it takes more than just just reading the
[24:36] listening to a prophet speak
[24:40] because if it doesn't take the holy
[24:42] ghost to come
[24:43] and and open the word to us then it
[24:46] doesn't do us any good right
[24:49] and it's one of the things that
[24:50] brother dale was speaking of yesterday
[24:52] in the minister's meeting
[24:54] you know speaking
[24:55] and the topic was the seventh seal
[24:59] and i know it was so good that you know
[25:02] the the stress was was made on one point
[25:07] see people want to look matthew 24 or
[25:10] revelation or everything
[25:13] but the important part was ephesians 4
[25:15] 30.
[25:18] because if you don't receive the seal of
[25:20] god don't worry about any other seals in
[25:22] the bible
[25:25] because the first main the main seal is
[25:28] is the holy ghost
[25:32] because if you're not going to receive
[25:33] that seal
[25:35] then don't worry about the seven seals
[25:37] in the book whether they're on the
[25:38] inside or the outside
[25:41] because if not then because he's only
[25:44] going to reveal to those in that special
[25:47] class
[25:48] so you've got to be in that group
[25:51] because as brother m said you've got to
[25:52] be sealed with the book
[25:56] so you've got to be sealed right and if
[25:58] and if that doesn't take place then it
[26:00] doesn't matter
[26:02] and see there's only one seal
[26:05] at all
[26:06] right right right exactly
[26:09] because who did he say that he said the
[26:10] book and he said revelation and the lamb
[26:12] took the book and he said who had it
[26:14] sealed he said it was the holy ghost
[26:16] so if the holy ghost had the book sealed
[26:19] then the only way that you're going to
[26:20] receive the revelation is to have the
[26:23] one that sealed the book inside of you
[26:27] so if you you've got to receive that
[26:28] seal
[26:31] and see that's what that's what's
[26:32] lacking in in the message today
[26:37] people people have heard and they and
[26:39] they walk around and they listen but one
[26:41] thing that they they have failed to
[26:43] receive is the new birth right amen amen
[26:48] see that is that is the part that we've
[26:50] got to catch and if we don't catch that
[26:53] then the rest of it doesn't mean
[26:54] anything
[26:58] because that's what
[27:00] i believe is is the most important
[27:03] aspect of this entire christian journey
[27:12] i think
[27:15] as brother dale says
[27:18] you know i'd rather be seeking god every
[27:19] day of my life
[27:21] and have it the whole time
[27:23] then think i've got it and come to find
[27:25] out i don't right
[27:27] it's it's
[27:29] it's that important
[27:34] but
[27:35] i just
[27:37] just want to thank the lord
[27:39] that
[27:41] one day
[27:44] that
[27:46] uh never
[27:48] never heard of
[27:50] lula georgia before
[27:52] i was in tennessee
[27:57] and
[27:58] they met sarah and came down and
[28:00] got to meet anna
[28:05] and
[28:06] i think the first i think the first time
[28:08] i ever come to this church i preached
[28:12] preach on a sunday evening
[28:16] but uh
[28:19] you know i i'd heard people say that
[28:21] stay away from
[28:23] you got to watch brother dale you got to
[28:25] watch it you got to watch this sam dale
[28:30] but you know what
[28:33] it goes back to
[28:35] when uh
[28:37] brother james instilling in us
[28:40] not to listen to what people say
[28:44] not the congregation not other ministers
[28:46] but listen to what people's being what's
[28:48] being preached
[28:50] that's what's what's what you have to
[28:51] listen to
[28:54] so you've got to take it and listen to
[28:55] it for yourself to find out what's being
[28:57] said and through that
[29:00] i can i say i appreciate god because
[29:04] amen
[29:07] the more i heard the more i understood
[29:10] and people can say whatever they want to
[29:11] but the more the more it became real to
[29:13] me
[29:15] and there were things that i understood
[29:18] and i said well and and you you can
[29:20] understand things carnally
[29:22] you underst because brother ram said you
[29:24] can have
[29:25] a mental conception of it
[29:28] you can have it in your mind and you
[29:30] know it but it not be a revelation
[29:34] and there were things that that i had
[29:36] read that i thought you know
[29:38] and this is the way i see it but i said
[29:40] well i don't know if that's if that's
[29:42] true but i don't see anything that
[29:43] contradicts this but you know i would
[29:45] have my own i guess you could call it my
[29:47] own idea but that's what i saw
[29:51] and you know i'd never heard anybody
[29:52] preach because a lot you know how many
[29:54] people how many times you've been places
[29:56] and hear people preach and it's the same
[29:58] old same old and nobody ever gets into
[30:00] anything deep
[30:04] and if you ever want you ever want to
[30:05] see preachers shuck and jive just ask
[30:07] them questions the next thing you know
[30:08] they are always moving around and you
[30:11] know they they're they're greater
[30:12] sometimes preachers act greater than
[30:14] politicians at dodging questions they
[30:16] talk a whole lot never answer anything
[30:23] yeah
[30:23] but you know there were times that i
[30:25] held on to things and i'm so glad that i
[30:27] came to a place
[30:30] that i heard brother dale preach things
[30:32] like you know what i understand that
[30:35] that was things that god showed me
[30:38] and there was a lot of things i held on
[30:40] to that i realized that that i that i
[30:42] saw in the scripture and and honestly
[30:45] it's just like if
[30:47] you know i never did believe in the
[30:48] trinity from the time i come in this
[30:51] world the first time i ever had a
[30:52] conscious thought i always knew brother
[30:54] branham was a prophet i never believed
[30:56] in the trinity
[30:57] but you know what i had misconceptions
[30:59] of this message that we held on to just
[31:02] the same as if we were trinitarians
[31:07] we were just con just as much confused
[31:09] as everybody else is in the world
[31:13] and i'm so glad that i had somebody
[31:16] that i that could come
[31:19] you know it's not it's not a man that's
[31:22] right but it's a vessel
[31:25] it's a ministry it's a gift
[31:27] that somebody can come that god can
[31:30] speak through to speak to you to answer
[31:33] the questions that you have
[31:37] that you've received
[31:38] and it's so amazing because you you see
[31:41] things
[31:43] and and you and you read it right
[31:46] and you read it right
[31:48] yeah
[31:49] you know
[31:51] i i was reading i was listening to
[31:53] somebody
[31:54] and i can't remember who was being where
[31:56] they were talking about martin luther
[31:58] said how many times do you think martha
[31:59] and martin luther read
[32:02] habakkuk
[32:05] how many times do you think he read that
[32:07] the just shall live by faith the just
[32:08] shall live by faith the just shall live
[32:10] by faith
[32:12] how many times how many times do you
[32:14] think that brother branham read
[32:16] malachi 4 and read revelation 10 7.
[32:21] how many times did paul read the old
[32:22] testament
[32:25] i mean here was here's a great learned
[32:27] man that read through the whole old
[32:28] testament
[32:30] i mean he could tell you all the things
[32:31] that moses said right i mean all the all
[32:34] the levitical rules and laws and all
[32:37] those things he knew him he could read
[32:39] them but the one thing i was liking to
[32:41] paul was paul never saw jesus in that
[32:45] he never saw the christ
[32:49] and so it's the same way we can read a
[32:51] lot of things but we don't see christ in
[32:53] it
[32:54] it doesn't become it's not real to us
[32:58] and yet so we have misconceptions of
[33:01] things
[33:02] that we hold on to why because that's
[33:04] all we've been told
[33:06] just as brothers how about you
[33:08] you've been talked which is your right
[33:10] hand and your left hand that's all
[33:11] you've been taught that's right
[33:14] so that's that's why that's why you see
[33:15] it that's the way you read it
[33:18] but then all of a sudden one day as
[33:20] you're reading the scripture it comes
[33:22] open to you
[33:26] you know i was
[33:27] i had i had
[33:28] one of the first times that that really
[33:31] in my life that really struck me i i've
[33:32] been reading the book the masterpiece
[33:35] and i'd read through it
[33:37] and
[33:38] uh i was i got a video
[33:41] of uh brother harold hildebrand
[33:43] preaching a special meeting and that's
[33:45] what he was preaching on the masterpiece
[33:48] and i was listening to him preach and
[33:50] and i thought well that can't be the
[33:51] same message that i've read
[33:54] and i had to go back and get the book
[33:57] and he was bringing things out of there
[33:59] that i that i read
[34:01] but i didn't but it didn't strike me
[34:04] but all of a sudden i was sitting there
[34:05] reading listening to brother held preach
[34:07] that and all of a sudden it was it was
[34:08] standing out to me i was like wow that's
[34:10] amazing i had to go back and look and
[34:11] there it was
[34:14] i'd read it
[34:15] but the inspiration never struck me
[34:19] and then all of a sudden it came a time
[34:21] that the inspiration struck glory and
[34:23] when the inspiration struck then it was
[34:25] like wow it was amazing
[34:28] and another point of
[34:30] of the scriptures that stand out to me
[34:32] is romans 8 and i've i've i've spoken on
[34:35] that before is you know
[34:38] i had brother dale preached on romans 8
[34:40] and and went through the whole chapter
[34:42] one time many years ago when
[34:45] you know i can't read romans 8 the same
[34:47] way i used to right
[34:50] why because it's been illuminated it's
[34:51] been open so when i see this it looks
[34:54] totally different than the way i used to
[34:55] see it
[34:57] because you know when i read romans 8 i
[34:59] don't read somebody else
[35:02] i read myself
[35:08] so when i'm reading the scripture
[35:11] and when you you look into the scripture
[35:13] are you reading because i'm not when i
[35:14] read abraham i'm not reading abraham
[35:18] i'm reading the seed of abraham that's
[35:20] right i'm looking i see myself i see me
[35:22] there
[35:24] i can't get away from that
[35:28] because that's what the scripture has
[35:29] come to do is to eliminate illuminate to
[35:33] us to us to see who we are to see what
[35:35] god has done for us
[35:40] and we'll run out of
[35:42] time ain't even got started yet
[35:45] terrence tommy had 30 minutes and the
[35:47] check was no good
[35:50] so
[35:51] how many minutes i got left
[35:53] one
[35:56] okay now from now on i'm going to be
[35:57] preaching for free
[36:01] all right
[36:03] all right
[36:04] but uh
[36:06] oh
[36:08] and that's just kind of
[36:10] a little background of what i wanna
[36:14] now i'm gonna start with a real sermon
[36:15] but anyway uh
[36:18] it was just a little bit of because
[36:21] it stirs something inside of you
[36:23] sometimes when you when you hear things
[36:25] and you know that's what paul said you
[36:27] know
[36:27] stir up your remembrance
[36:29] stir up your pure minds in the way of
[36:31] remembrance exactly
[36:33] things that you've heard right but you
[36:35] need to you need to be stirred up a
[36:36] little bit
[36:38] and you know one of the things that
[36:40] brother dale was when he was ministering
[36:43] yesterday
[36:47] and
[36:49] if y'all want to
[36:51] if they've got the
[36:52] they've got the scriptures
[36:55] i don't know who's back there brother
[36:56] bob but
[36:57] anyway uh ii peter
[37:02] 119
[37:06] says we have also a more sure word of
[37:09] prophecy
[37:10] where until you do well that you take
[37:12] heed as unto a light that shineth in a
[37:14] dark place until the day dawn and the
[37:17] day star arise in your hearts
[37:20] now that's that's the scripture that i
[37:21] want to want to get to
[37:23] but
[37:24] the the scriptures that i read in in
[37:27] romans
[37:28] and in colossians and romans it tell
[37:32] romans 16 it tells
[37:34] us he says now to him that is of power
[37:37] to establish you according to my gospel
[37:39] and the preaching of jesus christ
[37:42] according to the revelation of the
[37:44] mystery which was kept secret
[37:47] since the world began
[37:49] but now is made manifest by the
[37:50] scriptures of the prophets according to
[37:52] the commandment of the everlasting god
[37:54] made known to all nations for the
[37:56] obedience of faith amen
[37:59] and the the title that i have is the
[38:02] mystery and secret of god right because
[38:05] there there's a mystery but there's a
[38:07] secret
[38:09] and if you go back to the to the message
[38:11] christ the mystery you'll you'll find
[38:14] brother madam
[38:15] really deals with with a mystery and a
[38:18] secret right amen because he said
[38:20] because even brother madam calls it a
[38:21] hidden mystery yeah
[38:24] and
[38:28] it says the date on
[38:30] here peter says the day dawn and the day
[38:32] star arrives in your hearts amos 3 7
[38:35] tells us says surely the lord god will
[38:37] do nothing
[38:39] right but he revealeth his secret unto
[38:42] his servants the prophets
[38:45] and then he said in revelation 10 7 says
[38:47] but in the days of the voice of the
[38:49] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[38:51] sound the mystery of god should be
[38:53] finished as he had declared unto his
[38:55] servants the prophets
[38:57] now
[38:58] mystery i don't know if they've got this
[39:02] but uh mystery means something not
[39:04] understood
[39:06] or beyond understanding
[39:09] a religious truth that one can know only
[39:12] by revelation and cannot fully
[39:14] understand right
[39:18] and and that struck me because brother
[39:19] branham said in uh
[39:22] i believe it's his serves as it's the
[39:23] time
[39:24] he that's where he goes back he says a
[39:26] mystery is a scripture a previously
[39:29] hidden truth
[39:30] now divinely revealed but which is
[39:33] a supernatural element
[39:36] but which a supernatural element still
[39:38] remains despite the revelation
[39:43] and then a secret means kept from
[39:45] knowledge or view
[39:46] revealed only to the initiated designed
[39:50] to elude observation or detection
[39:53] or working with hidden aims or methods
[39:56] right
[39:58] so we a mystery
[40:01] and a secret
[40:03] and brother branham goes on to talk
[40:05] about
[40:06] in christ the mystery he says now
[40:09] god's secret mystery he had before the
[40:12] world began
[40:16] but back in the back part of god's mind
[40:18] there was something that he was trying
[40:21] and was going to achieve and he had a
[40:22] motive in doing it in order to let
[40:24] himself be expressed
[40:28] because first there wasn't even a
[40:30] moon star adam or molecule or anything
[40:33] he was god
[40:35] but he wasn't exactly god at that time
[40:37] because god is an object of worship and
[40:39] there wasn't anything there was nothing
[40:41] to worship him so in his great mind he
[40:44] wanted these attributes to be expressed
[40:46] right
[40:47] and in him was love and him was to be
[40:49] father and him to be son in him to be
[40:51] savior and him to be a healer all these
[40:54] great attributes that we already see
[40:56] expressed they were in god
[41:01] and
[41:03] let's go to the
[41:04] the next one brother
[41:07] brother brahms continues on 17 17 1 here
[41:09] says
[41:12] god had a purpose and a hidden mystery
[41:14] and that's what i want to speak on to
[41:15] the church this morning the hidden
[41:17] mystery of god that he had in his mind
[41:19] before the world ever began and how that
[41:21] it's unfolded itself right down to this
[41:23] present hour that we're living then you
[41:25] will understand clearly then oh i
[41:27] believe what is being done
[41:29] god's great mystery of how it's a secret
[41:32] he kept it a secret nobody knows nothing
[41:35] about it even the angels didn't
[41:37] understand it see he didn't reveal it
[41:39] that's the reason under our seventh
[41:40] mystery when the seventh seal was opened
[41:43] there was silence
[41:46] and that just really stood out to me
[41:49] when
[41:50] brothel was speaking on the
[41:52] on the seventh seal
[41:54] to understand why the why there was
[41:57] silence to understand
[41:59] god had a secret
[42:02] to be revealed
[42:04] and you know to understand what a secret
[42:06] was because the bible tells us and
[42:10] there are several different scriptures
[42:11] that talk about
[42:13] the revelation was headed sure the
[42:16] mystery was hid
[42:18] and so it was hid and so it was a secret
[42:20] brotherhood said there was a seek god
[42:22] had a secret
[42:23] of what he wanted to do but he didn't
[42:24] even let the angels understand he didn't
[42:26] let anybody know what was going to take
[42:28] place
[42:29] it was hid
[42:31] and see a secret
[42:33] is something
[42:34] that's hit from view
[42:37] see there was something that he had that
[42:38] he didn't want anybody to know
[42:42] and so when somebody
[42:45] and a just a simple illustration but i
[42:48] want y'all to catch what i'm saying i
[42:50] hope i don't confuse you
[42:53] but little kids will come up to you and
[42:55] say i got a secret
[42:58] well as soon as you come up and tell me
[43:00] i got a secret it ain't a secret anymore
[43:03] you know what it become
[43:05] a mystery
[43:08] because if you don't tell me i got a
[43:09] secret it's a secret
[43:11] but as soon as you tell me i got a
[43:13] secret it becomes a mystery because it
[43:15] never becomes a question of what is it
[43:18] right that's right
[43:20] and i kept i was talking to brother
[43:22] matthew bray last night on the phone and
[43:24] we were we were talking i said i can't
[43:25] remember which one of the there was a
[43:27] bobby lewis and clark i can't remember
[43:28] which one of the explorers years ago
[43:31] they had black people with them
[43:34] in their in their expedition
[43:36] and the indians the native americans had
[43:38] never seen black people before
[43:40] they had seen white people but never
[43:42] seen black people so when they came into
[43:44] camp
[43:45] the black the indians the native
[43:48] americans were so amazed that they were
[43:49] black people
[43:52] and they were kind of like
[43:53] little standoffish they were amazed
[43:58] and after they got over their initial
[44:00] shock and
[44:02] scaredness
[44:04] you know they walked up to them and and
[44:05] they were amazed and they tried to rub
[44:07] the black off of them
[44:12] but see if if if the native americans
[44:15] had never seen it then it was a secret
[44:18] to them because it was never known to
[44:19] them exactly
[44:21] but then all of a sudden when it became
[44:23] known it became visible
[44:26] then it became a mystery because then it
[44:28] was like what is this right
[44:30] and so that's what the secret was as
[44:32] long as nothing was ever known but he
[44:34] had something that he wanted to express
[44:37] but he didn't let anybody know of it
[44:40] and then and brother branham goes on in
[44:42] christ the mystery and he and he tells
[44:44] us in time as he was going on that
[44:47] through the prophets
[44:49] and the masterpiece he said the prophet
[44:52] uh the foundation was laid by the
[44:54] patriarchs he said the prophets built
[44:56] the body
[44:59] and he said it was little by little but
[45:00] they didn't understand
[45:02] he said it was head
[45:06] he said each part of that was hidden but
[45:08] it was being made manifest
[45:12] and all the way through the scripture it
[45:14] was hidden
[45:16] and so all these things were hidden
[45:18] through the scripture but it was god's
[45:20] plan
[45:23] and so
[45:24] in time
[45:26] through through the prophets they caught
[45:29] a part of the mystery right
[45:33] but the main part of was still a secret
[45:36] because there was only a part of that
[45:38] mystery that was being made known
[45:41] and so in time as he came through then
[45:44] each one of them picked up picked up
[45:46] where the previous prophet had left off
[45:48] or the patriarch had left off and picked
[45:51] that up and continued to carry it and it
[45:54] became more of a mystery but underneath
[45:56] that mystery laid a secret
[45:58] glory and so then it became owned
[46:02] and it continued on until the end time
[46:08] and so we we still still
[46:11] have a
[46:12] secret
[46:14] sure
[46:15] but he came to that place and then
[46:16] brother branham said that god had a had
[46:18] a mystery
[46:21] that had a a threefold revelation
[46:27] but it was a secret right
[46:30] and so
[46:31] as as time went on we seen how the
[46:34] scripture tells us it continues to tell
[46:36] us that it was a threefold revelation
[46:41] that went through this this secret was
[46:42] kept
[46:44] but then it came to a time
[46:46] that it took a profit
[46:49] to unfold these things
[46:52] the scriptures
[46:55] the
[46:58] those hidden truths
[47:00] because he said he said it would take
[47:04] the seventh angel
[47:06] to come
[47:08] and through him that we would speak
[47:11] those divinely mystery truths to make
[47:14] them known
[47:17] see the scripture tells us has told us
[47:20] all the way through
[47:21] that
[47:23] what was what was going to take place
[47:27] but it laid but it was laid there right
[47:32] and you know just as brother was
[47:33] speaking of in the
[47:36] seals when you when you look at the
[47:39] under the first seal
[47:41] see people only see
[47:44] the mystery of it
[47:47] because all they see is well i see a
[47:48] white horse rider
[47:50] but they've missed but they've missed
[47:51] the the greater part of it
[47:55] they've missed they've missed the part
[47:56] that was secret right
[48:00] and people read the scripture and say
[48:01] well it was a lamb that took the book
[48:04] but the greater part of that was that
[48:06] when brother branham stood there and
[48:07] said here stands a lamb with the book in
[48:09] his hand
[48:12] see people miss that
[48:14] because he said see you people have not
[48:15] called what's been going on all this
[48:17] week
[48:19] because it was them it was the lamb that
[48:22] came
[48:23] and was opening the word
[48:25] but see they missed that
[48:28] and it goes and you look back and it's
[48:30] all the way through the scripture
[48:33] see everybody looks and you know go back
[48:36] to the children of israel the children
[48:37] of israel could see the pillar of cloud
[48:40] and the pillar of fire
[48:43] they could they could see that that god
[48:45] was above them but they couldn't see god
[48:47] was with them
[48:50] they saw the pillar of fire and they
[48:52] could see when the when the when the
[48:53] cloud came down in the tabernacle
[48:56] but they couldn't see god in flesh in
[48:58] the in the man moses
[49:03] see brother said they missed they missed
[49:05] the grace of god because he said they
[49:07] had water out of a rock he said they had
[49:10] manna come out of the sky
[49:12] they they missed all of those things he
[49:14] said the brazen serpent the grace of god
[49:16] gave them all those and that's what they
[49:17] missed
[49:21] there was there was god in there in
[49:23] their midst and they missed him amen
[49:25] right
[49:27] and that's what and you go through all
[49:28] the through the scriptures you see the
[49:30] same thing
[49:32] that there was a secret
[49:35] and it was and it was a mystery
[49:39] and many times we can we can read this
[49:42] we read the scripture but we've missed
[49:44] what we've missed
[49:46] seeing
[49:47] him right
[49:50] that there's a secret there
[49:53] and that's what brother branham came to
[49:55] do in this last days
[49:58] is to unfold what was in the scripture
[50:03] what laid there
[50:05] was always there right right
[50:09] in
[50:10] in
[50:13] we're going to see if
[50:14] we can find this one this is sir is this
[50:17] the
[50:17] the end
[50:19] 1962 you know and then brother branham
[50:22] speaking
[50:24] of the vision and he talks about uh the
[50:26] wrecking bar one of the things that
[50:28] brother brown brother was speaking of
[50:30] yesterday about
[50:31] you know brother branham was was telling
[50:33] the vision
[50:34] and he said
[50:35] he took that wrecking ball the crowbar
[50:37] and he said you know he said i struck
[50:38] the top you struck the top of the
[50:39] mountain
[50:41] ripped it around
[50:44] and lifted the cap off of it and it was
[50:46] in the shape of a pyramid
[50:48] and you're at the top of it often there
[50:49] was months and months and months before
[50:51] the pyramid message was preached and he
[50:54] said beneath that was white stone
[50:56] granite
[50:57] and he said the sun or the light has
[50:59] never shined on this before he said look
[51:02] on this watch this
[51:04] and that's right
[51:06] because in the formation of the world
[51:08] the world was formed
[51:09] before there was light
[51:11] we know that
[51:13] god moved upon the water in the
[51:14] beginning he spoke for light and
[51:16] naturally down
[51:18] and there in the age that formation was
[51:20] the light had never come upon that stone
[51:24] he said look upon this light has never
[51:26] come upon this before and when all of
[51:29] them got up and i told them to watch and
[51:31] all of them come up and look in
[51:33] and he said while i while they were
[51:35] looking in
[51:36] he looked out of the corner
[51:38] of his eye i believe it was and watched
[51:40] me i slipped off to one side heading
[51:42] toward the west going down the hill
[51:45] going down the hill coming up the hill
[51:47] going downhill getting smaller small all
[51:48] the time
[51:51] and he said then the brother turned
[51:52] around after a while and said did he
[51:55] vanish where did he go and he said some
[51:57] took out that way some took
[51:59] one way and some another
[52:03] but a very few
[52:05] stayed and looked on what i had told
[52:07] them
[52:08] but notice the interpretation of the
[52:10] dream which i never told him one thing
[52:13] another things that i tell you
[52:18] but that's what he was talking about
[52:22] he was talking of the word right
[52:25] he said light had never shined on this
[52:31] the word
[52:32] everything that brother branham preached
[52:34] lays in the in the in the bible
[52:37] there wasn't anything that he added
[52:39] there wasn't anything that he he took
[52:41] out of
[52:42] somewhere else
[52:44] it laid in the word but that's what he
[52:46] was talking about when he saw that
[52:47] vision see there was a cap that was on
[52:49] the on
[52:51] and he said he opened it up and he said
[52:53] that the stone was laying there
[52:55] the stone that was rejected but it was
[52:57] still there it was in there and he said
[52:59] the light had never shined on this
[53:01] before but he told them he said stay
[53:03] here and look on this because he had to
[53:05] go west but he said keep looking on it
[53:08] what was it they were supposed they
[53:09] would stay with the word
[53:11] because you know he's preaching he said
[53:12] we're waiting for the revelation of this
[53:14] to come
[53:16] see he knew that he said i must decrease
[53:18] brother said i must decrease that he
[53:20] might increase
[53:22] why because he was pointing them to the
[53:24] word glory
[53:26] and see the brother had the vision and
[53:28] brother was telling them keep your eye
[53:29] on this
[53:31] stay here and look on this
[53:33] but he said what happened they ran away
[53:35] from it
[53:37] he said but a very few stayed and looked
[53:39] on it
[53:41] why because they missed him
[53:45] see that was a mystery but you know what
[53:47] the secret was coming
[53:51] there was a there was an unfolding of
[53:53] the word glory
[53:55] see people people have it all mixed up
[53:58] and they and they think that brother
[53:59] branham done something it wasn't he was
[54:02] he was as brother tim calhoun was
[54:04] speaking of yesterday you know brother
[54:06] said i'm perfectly mute
[54:08] he was perfectly mute until he came it
[54:11] was and then he was just the mouthpiece
[54:14] that was predestinated to come at this
[54:16] appointed time to stand here and god
[54:19] could use his voice to speak
[54:22] amen and that's what he came to do was
[54:24] to speak the word
[54:27] you know
[54:29] you know what it you know you go through
[54:30] the scriptures and look you know
[54:32] serpents see late in the scripture
[54:35] it's always been there
[54:37] all of all of these great mysteries that
[54:39] lay in here
[54:40] all about no eternal hail
[54:43] i mean the truth the truth of baptism
[54:45] the new birth all the different things
[54:47] that were going to take place
[54:51] we understood how how god is is coming
[54:54] that's going to how the they have
[54:56] bringing the redemption to israel
[54:58] an end time messenger coming
[55:01] it laid in the scripture all these
[55:03] things were there but it took some it
[55:05] took somebody to come right that hadn't
[55:08] had the had a prophetic gift right
[55:12] to come
[55:13] and it wasn't brother brown that opened
[55:15] the word to us
[55:17] but it was that same one that came
[55:20] that he could that he could speak
[55:22] through someone all right to open this
[55:24] scripture up exactly
[55:27] because you know i
[55:28] i don't care
[55:30] what what if brother brenham done
[55:32] anything in his life you know or
[55:34] whatever you know he could have been a
[55:35] drunk or whatever it didn't matter but
[55:37] you know what did he point me to
[55:40] you know that's the reason i don't you
[55:41] know
[55:42] if it doesn't matter if what if the
[55:45] preachers are wrong if they can point me
[55:47] to christ that's what i want to see
[55:52] you know i i think about you know i
[55:55] believe balaam you know
[55:56] sitting on a donkey
[56:00] you know the donkey was able to see the
[56:02] angel with the sword amen exactly
[56:07] balaam couldn't see that right
[56:10] but you know god had had to speak
[56:11] through that dumb animal right to the
[56:14] prophet i see to make you understand
[56:16] right right and whatever it takes for us
[56:19] to see then that's what that's what i'm
[56:20] looking for
[56:23] but that's what i see is that we have
[56:25] seen god
[56:27] has come
[56:29] to open his word to us
[56:32] that we can speak that he can speak
[56:33] through us
[56:36] and so
[56:37] we can we can read the scripture
[56:40] but you know what it there still lays a
[56:42] supernatural element there to it amen
[56:45] that's right
[56:46] so
[56:48] because
[56:50] that doesn't when you read
[56:53] then all of a sudden things stand out to
[56:55] you
[56:56] and when they stand out to you then then
[56:58] it can be revealed that's right amen
[57:01] because if you don't if you don't hold
[57:03] the word it can't be revealed to you
[57:07] that's the reason that everybody gets
[57:09] all kin are all confused about uh
[57:12] you know having where's the seed lay in
[57:15] you and having
[57:17] being predestinated and understanding
[57:19] all of these things
[57:22] why because it's a representation of
[57:24] predestination
[57:26] there is a seed there but it's
[57:28] representation right
[57:32] because even ephesians 2 tells us you
[57:34] know we were born just like everybody
[57:36] else in this world was we were born the
[57:38] children of wrath even as of amen it
[57:40] says we were dead in sin and trespassed
[57:45] and it says you had to be quickened
[57:47] right
[57:49] you had to hear the word ephesians 1
[57:50] tells us that we had to hear the word
[57:52] the gospel of our salvation that we can
[57:55] be sealed by it right
[57:57] that's right
[57:58] see you had to you had to hear something
[58:02] i know it don't make me any better than
[58:04] anybody else in this world why because i
[58:05] came the same way i came under the same
[58:08] sin curse that they came under that's
[58:10] right
[58:11] amen but you know what i had to hear the
[58:12] word i had to hold on to the word and
[58:14] then god in his infinite grace unto me
[58:18] could be revealed to me
[58:23] and so it has been a it's it's still
[58:27] a secret to people
[58:33] we say it's it's a mystery yeah it's a
[58:35] mystery
[58:39] but a lot of people they they've never
[58:40] seen it right
[58:42] it's still a secret
[58:45] it's still a secret we still have
[58:47] there's still a secret coming
[58:50] that's right
[58:53] when did when did when did jesus christ
[58:56] start
[58:57] his coming
[59:00] where they
[59:02] he's it's been ever since the day of
[59:04] pentecost
[59:06] he's been coming to the people to the
[59:08] bride since the day of pentecost
[59:11] he's been revealing his word since the
[59:13] day of pentecost it has been unfolding
[59:15] since the day of pentecost right
[59:18] and as as time has progressed then you
[59:22] then
[59:24] you understand it and as you see it it
[59:27] god couldn't do it any other way
[59:31] the plan of god could not ever come any
[59:32] other way
[59:37] because you know
[59:38] he birthed
[59:40] because he was the seed and he came
[59:42] forth and he said that seed
[59:45] had to go into the ground
[59:47] to reproduce in the last day
[59:50] to be the very thing that he was
[59:53] he came in flesh to be
[59:56] sin
[59:57] that we might be the righteousness the
[1:00:00] righteousness of god that we might be
[1:00:02] the re
[1:00:04] um
[1:00:05] the manifestation
[1:00:07] of what he is
[1:00:10] because he said you know if a seed dies
[1:00:12] and it doesn't go in the ground
[1:00:14] it abides alone
[1:00:16] but it has to go into the ground
[1:00:20] and you know you see these things and
[1:00:22] you know i was listening to brother
[1:00:23] branham the other day and you know he
[1:00:24] was
[1:00:25] telling the story about the man that
[1:00:27] you know he said what kind of god would
[1:00:29] you have and you know he just had his
[1:00:31] hands across them in the in the dark
[1:00:33] ages and watching them die
[1:00:35] and now you know how they were all being
[1:00:37] killed and they had they gave their
[1:00:38] lives but you know they were anointed
[1:00:41] for their for their ministry they were
[1:00:43] anointed for their time because you know
[1:00:45] this the scripture tells us under the
[1:00:47] under the seal it tells us that he came
[1:00:50] to he had the sword and he came to take
[1:00:51] peace from the earth but you know the
[1:00:53] one thing they couldn't do was because
[1:00:55] he said they gave their lives because
[1:00:57] they were under anointed under that calf
[1:00:59] anointing they gave their lives you
[1:01:02] couldn't take it from them
[1:01:05] so it was not anything that one because
[1:01:06] it because they realized to give up
[1:01:08] their life was a great game to god
[1:01:10] because they had something better laid
[1:01:12] up than what was down here so you wasn't
[1:01:14] taking anything from them because you
[1:01:16] were sending them to their better place
[1:01:22] see and so when the devil thinks he's
[1:01:24] got something on us he don't have
[1:01:25] anything on it
[1:01:30] and so that's what we see in this in
[1:01:31] this hour
[1:01:33] we have seen the unfolding
[1:01:37] but see there's a there is a secret
[1:01:40] and you know what it's only to a very
[1:01:42] few
[1:01:45] well because we're still we still
[1:01:46] there's a mystery to be made known
[1:01:49] but when it's made known then you
[1:01:50] extended his brother branham was talking
[1:01:52] about we're waiting on the coming of the
[1:01:54] lord but he's not saying i'm not saying
[1:01:56] he's coming he said i'm saying he's here
[1:02:02] see everybody gets all confused about
[1:02:03] you know the appearing and the coming
[1:02:05] and all the different comings in the
[1:02:07] scripture
[1:02:09] but you know what if you allow him to
[1:02:11] come and speak to you it lays out
[1:02:13] perfect
[1:02:15] that's right
[1:02:17] see there's only there's only one
[1:02:18] revelation of the word
[1:02:20] there's only one revelation and there's
[1:02:22] only one way to take this word right
[1:02:23] here and make it line up right and he
[1:02:26] said he said that he take this word and
[1:02:28] every part of it dovetail together
[1:02:30] there's only one way for that to take
[1:02:32] place
[1:02:33] and that's if he is revealing the word
[1:02:35] amen not anybody else can reveal the
[1:02:37] word he reveals the word
[1:02:39] and if we if we understand that god
[1:02:44] has given us this message
[1:02:47] and that's the reason why you can't just
[1:02:49] take it and say brother branham say it
[1:02:52] brother branham said you can read off
[1:02:54] you can read out of the book and say
[1:02:55] well brother branham see it well that's
[1:02:56] not going to help you
[1:02:58] because it doesn't mean anything until
[1:03:00] it becomes real to you until it's a
[1:03:02] revelation to you
[1:03:05] if it's not if it is if it's not a
[1:03:07] revelation to you not just saying what
[1:03:09] he said because he said no one can call
[1:03:12] jesus to christ except it be by the holy
[1:03:15] ghost you can't you can't call this word
[1:03:18] the word unless it be by the holy ghost
[1:03:20] you can't speak this word unless it's by
[1:03:22] the holy ghost because it's him speaking
[1:03:24] through you
[1:03:25] brother venom said he said in the last
[1:03:27] days you know he was speaking and he
[1:03:29] said you know are we all going to be
[1:03:31] able to do miracles are we just going to
[1:03:32] be doing it by the holy ghost he said
[1:03:34] we're all we're you know all able to do
[1:03:36] miracles but he said it's by the holy
[1:03:38] ghost
[1:03:39] it takes the unction of the holy ghost
[1:03:41] to do miracles but see you know a lot of
[1:03:43] people say we're just going to give it
[1:03:44] to brother wade to do all the miracles
[1:03:46] or somebody else to do things no it's
[1:03:48] every single one of us
[1:03:52] you know i was i was
[1:03:54] reading the story about the lady that
[1:03:56] was uh
[1:03:58] you know she was in the had the in the
[1:04:00] prayer line had the baby
[1:04:01] you know it says the had a it was a blue
[1:04:03] baby and the lady was standing
[1:04:05] you know she was a christian and the
[1:04:06] lord kept telling her said go pray for
[1:04:08] that baby
[1:04:10] and you know she kept trying to get away
[1:04:12] from and the lord kept telling her you
[1:04:13] need to go pray for that baby
[1:04:15] and she said a little bit later she the
[1:04:16] lady come by and she had a prayer card
[1:04:18] in her hand and said well brother
[1:04:19] branham will pray for
[1:04:21] pray for the baby he said no you
[1:04:23] couldn't get away from that
[1:04:25] and finally you know she had she went up
[1:04:26] and had the lady sit in her chair and uh
[1:04:29] you know pray for the baby
[1:04:31] and then you know she went up set up way
[1:04:33] up in the balcony there and you know
[1:04:35] brother branham said you know when she
[1:04:36] come across the platform she had a
[1:04:38] prayer card and they thought you know
[1:04:41] you tell there was something wrong with
[1:04:42] a baby but you know he walked up there
[1:04:43] and said sister
[1:04:45] this baby's already healed
[1:04:48] said that lady in the balcony up there
[1:04:50] on the end of the road there in the
[1:04:52] third balcony or whatever said you know
[1:04:54] she prayed for it
[1:04:56] said the baby's healed
[1:04:58] amen brother ram said that lady up in
[1:04:59] the balcony about fell out of her chair
[1:05:03] but see that was god she had the action
[1:05:05] of the holy ghost to do something that's
[1:05:07] right and that's what it takes
[1:05:11] it's not it's no big eyes or little uses
[1:05:14] every single one of us
[1:05:17] that we all work together
[1:05:20] and that's and that's what comes through
[1:05:22] the opening of the word
[1:05:24] is is to understand who you are that's
[1:05:27] right
[1:05:29] and when when this when does
[1:05:31] people say well
[1:05:33] getting back to yesterday is the seventh
[1:05:35] seal open
[1:05:38] is it closed
[1:05:39] is the lamb off the mercy seat is he on
[1:05:42] the mercy seat
[1:05:45] and you can only speak by your
[1:05:47] revelation amen right right that's all
[1:05:49] brother branham could do he said this is
[1:05:51] my revelation that's all he could speak
[1:05:53] of
[1:05:55] and it that's what it is so when you say
[1:05:57] is the seventh seal what is the seventh
[1:05:59] seal
[1:06:00] it's what it what is it to you amen
[1:06:03] when the word opens to you
[1:06:05] what was the seal to do
[1:06:07] reveal christ
[1:06:09] do you see christ
[1:06:11] that's what it takes it's to you because
[1:06:13] you so anybody as brother dale always
[1:06:16] tells us listen he can't he can't say
[1:06:18] nobody else has a is born again except
[1:06:20] for him
[1:06:24] that's the only person
[1:06:26] but do you have the holy ghost amen
[1:06:29] because he said if you have the new
[1:06:30] birth he said then he will lead you and
[1:06:32] guide you into all truth
[1:06:36] and it's not just reading
[1:06:39] but it's for him to come personally to
[1:06:41] you what is the new birth
[1:06:44] it's the revelation of jesus christ
[1:06:45] personally to you amen
[1:06:47] exactly when he was when brother brown
[1:06:49] was speaking in christ in mystery and i
[1:06:50] didn't get to it because i'm trying to
[1:06:52] wrap up here but when he was speaking in
[1:06:54] christ's mystery when he when he starts
[1:06:56] speaking of that threefold revelation
[1:06:58] then he goes right in he says then what
[1:07:00] is the new birth
[1:07:02] it's that revelation
[1:07:03] you've got to have a revelation of jesus
[1:07:05] christ
[1:07:07] in the new birth
[1:07:08] and then from there from there you can
[1:07:11] see
[1:07:12] all that god was he poured into christ
[1:07:14] all that christ was he poured into you
[1:07:17] and brother branham said also in 1964 he
[1:07:20] said all that god was he poured into
[1:07:22] christ and all that christ was he poured
[1:07:24] into the believer
[1:07:25] he didn't just say the bride he said end
[1:07:27] of the believer
[1:07:30] that you and i become the fullness of
[1:07:32] jesus christ amen
[1:07:35] we are we are the we are
[1:07:37] christ made manifest
[1:07:40] the fullness of the godhead bodily amen
[1:07:44] see you've got to see who you are i've
[1:07:46] got to see who i am
[1:07:49] and then when we see that he said we can
[1:07:51] be an invincible army
[1:07:53] and then the rapture can go
[1:07:56] amen god bless you i saw stand
[1:08:03] i tried to keep an hour
[1:08:17] i thank the lord for
[1:08:19] what we've seen
[1:08:20] and what we've heard
[1:08:24] god had a hidden mystery
[1:08:27] it was hid
[1:08:29] but see that's the reason that
[1:08:31] it's so it's so important as brother was
[1:08:34] telling us
[1:08:35] yesterday when he got down toward the
[1:08:36] end of of this of his sermon
[1:08:40] you know
[1:08:42] he was talking about brother branham he
[1:08:44] said you know he said i can put my
[1:08:46] confidence in him
[1:08:49] what god gave him
[1:08:52] through that
[1:08:53] god can come speak to me
[1:08:56] so we we know that it had to come down
[1:08:58] to this time
[1:08:59] no other time but this time
[1:09:02] that god promised to send
[1:09:04] elijah to send a prophet to this age a
[1:09:08] seer someone that he could speak through
[1:09:12] he said he come to top all the loose
[1:09:14] sins
[1:09:15] all the way through history he said
[1:09:17] those fellas he said they probed at it
[1:09:20] but there come one now
[1:09:24] and perfectly vindicated
[1:09:27] see people people have tried to
[1:09:29] discredit this message
[1:09:31] and everything that brother branham's
[1:09:32] done and everything that he said
[1:09:36] and you know what a lot of times the
[1:09:38] more they try to prove him wrong the
[1:09:39] more they try to they end up proving him
[1:09:40] right
[1:09:45] but you know the scripture tells us in
[1:09:46] the last days scoffers would come you're
[1:09:49] right
[1:09:50] that's right
[1:09:52] and he said because of this he said
[1:09:54] they're ignorant
[1:09:55] peter said they're ignorant
[1:09:57] right one because lots of times they
[1:09:59] read
[1:10:01] but they're confused
[1:10:03] on what they're reading
[1:10:07] and so without without having one to
[1:10:10] show them they're confused so then they
[1:10:11] say well it's all just
[1:10:14] all messed up it's just a bunch of
[1:10:16] goop whatever you know
[1:10:20] but it takes an eye
[1:10:22] of revelation
[1:10:23] and that's what's been promised in our
[1:10:25] day
[1:10:26] and i'm so thankful for that brother go
[1:10:28] ahead let's try number 217
