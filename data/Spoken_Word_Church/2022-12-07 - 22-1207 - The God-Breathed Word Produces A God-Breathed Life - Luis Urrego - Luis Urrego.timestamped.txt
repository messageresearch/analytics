[7:21] appreciate sister Peggy
[7:23] thank you for for a good time we had
[7:27] Sunday
[7:29] and uh just a quick uh announcement I
[7:33] just wanted to uh to mention to you all
[7:35] you all remember us in your prayers uh
[7:37] uh we're we're going to be heading out
[7:39] for Nicaragua on January 11th
[7:41] through the 23rd so we'll be there about
[7:44] two weeks
[7:45] and it'll only be Nicaragua this time
[7:48] just one country last time it was three
[7:50] countries
[7:51] and it is only it'd only be for two
[7:53] weeks not seven and a half weeks like
[7:56] last time
[7:57] but during this time uh frame the the
[8:00] the the the Youth Camp that is usually
[8:03] held uh by byc
[8:06] um
[8:07] that brother Mike Siebert started back
[8:09] back in the 60s 70s I believe it was and
[8:13] they do have a similar Youth Camp down
[8:16] in in Nicaragua and he started that back
[8:18] in the 90s I believe
[8:20] and so we're going to be we're going to
[8:23] be there during that time and this time
[8:26] I'm going to take uh we're gonna have
[8:28] brother Bob black with us
[8:31] so
[8:35] and I I'm thoroughly looking forward to
[8:37] it as I know he is
[8:40] and this will be his I guess this will
[8:42] be your first mission trip right
[8:45] so I figure he got his passport might as
[8:48] well take him out
[8:52] you get him to do something I told the
[8:54] brothers down there uh that you know I
[8:57] believe that the people down there will
[8:58] benefit from his ministry as well
[9:01] and so we're not going to just be part
[9:03] of the youth campus there we're also
[9:05] going to minister into the bride of
[9:07] Christ and and other churches around the
[9:09] area as well
[9:10] and uh and I'll be his interpreter
[9:13] so I'll be preaching along with him but
[9:15] I won't be preaching
[9:18] but uh uh so you just pray for us we're
[9:21] also going to take a few of the youth
[9:23] from here Nyla is going to be going with
[9:25] us
[9:27] uh
[9:31] Michael Michael benungwe he's going to
[9:34] be going with us
[9:38] and uh I believe that's it from here
[9:43] uh yeah well my daughters they're
[9:45] they're going on obviously
[9:49] and then there's uh there's there's a uh
[9:52] Sister Jordan from Texas she's gonna be
[9:54] gone so she's gonna be coming as well
[9:57] and so we're looking to have a good time
[9:59] and I believe it'll be a good experience
[10:01] for for the for the Youth as well
[10:04] I'd say if you can go out of the country
[10:06] at least one time you're in life and not
[10:08] to just vacation or go on a cruise but
[10:11] actually live with the people
[10:13] it'll change your life
[10:15] it'll make you see things much different
[10:18] it'll make you appreciate what you have
[10:21] and so that's that's kind of what what
[10:24] one of the the hopes of this trip is so
[10:26] you remember us in your prayers as we'll
[10:28] be doing that also remember me in your
[10:30] prayers I'll I'll be speaking in South
[10:32] Carolina on on the 18th so for brother
[10:35] Gene Williams he he messaged me today
[10:38] and I told him that should be fine so
[10:40] I'm waiting for his reply so you
[10:42] remember us in your prayers as well for
[10:44] that
[10:44] if you have your Bibles this evening
[10:46] let's turn to Second Timothy chapter
[10:48] three
[10:50] I appreciate your patience
[10:53] second Timothy chapter three
[10:58] I wanna
[11:00] I wanna I know that maybe we've heard
[11:02] these questions before but and if the
[11:05] brothers back there uh
[11:08] um I'll just what I'll do they're
[11:11] listening out what I'll do is I'll just
[11:12] uh I'll just use my phone just to show
[11:15] the video and the in the in the images
[11:18] so
[11:22] um
[11:23] so they can pull up the scriptures
[11:27] but I know that that in dealing with
[11:29] people we always
[11:30] um we always have to deal with these
[11:32] questions and and
[11:34] you know and a lot of our youth they're
[11:36] having to deal with these questions
[11:38] you know the the more and more uh
[11:42] everything's becoming more secularized
[11:44] and and the youth are the people are are
[11:50] being led to believe more in science
[11:52] than the word of God
[11:54] there's even there's even uh there's a
[11:57] there's a there's a theme or there's a
[11:58] almost like a religion it's called
[12:01] scientism
[12:03] and it's it's the it's the it's where if
[12:07] science can't prove it then it doesn't
[12:09] exist and it doesn't it's not reality
[12:13] and sometimes us as Christians we tend
[12:17] to almost believe more in science than
[12:19] we do word of God
[12:21] the word of God tells us something and
[12:24] it clearly directly says something but
[12:26] yet because NASA said something or you
[12:30] know we kind of just lean more towards
[12:32] NASA because they know better than God
[12:35] hmm
[12:37] that's kind of the attitude that we take
[12:39] sometimes
[12:41] or or you can have not just be nasty
[12:43] because the government said so they know
[12:46] more than God
[12:48] because we're in advance we've Advanced
[12:50] more than God but I you know what I'd
[12:52] rather stay with the word of God because
[12:55] the word of God is God's breathed
[12:58] God breathed his word amen and he knew
[13:02] the beginning from the end
[13:05] NASA Only Knows up to a certain point
[13:08] the government knows up to a certain
[13:10] point
[13:11] but God knows for through all eternity
[13:14] amen so so here's a dilemma there are
[13:17] our our people the people have today is
[13:19] can we trust a book that is written by
[13:22] man
[13:23] how do I know that it's even true how do
[13:27] I know that the Bible is true
[13:30] how do you know that the Bible is true
[13:31] why are we so consumed with the word of
[13:34] God that that that that that that it you
[13:37] know we we believe that it's the word of
[13:39] God and what's so special about the
[13:40] Bible from any other book that you might
[13:43] find in the library
[13:44] so we want to talk about that this
[13:46] distance this evening let's read second
[13:48] Timothy chapter 3 verse 10.
[13:52] it says here but thou has fully known my
[13:54] Doctrine this is Paul Paul speaking to
[13:57] to Timothy a young man a young man he
[14:00] was a young man but thou has fully known
[14:02] my Doctrine manner of life purpose Faith
[14:04] long-suffering charity patience
[14:06] persecutions afflictions which came unto
[14:09] me at Antioch at Iconium at lystra what
[14:13] persecutions I endured but out of them
[14:16] all the Lord delivered me
[14:19] now I'm sure we can all say the same
[14:21] thing too
[14:22] yay and all that will live Godly in
[14:24] Christ Jesus will have a flowery bed of
[14:27] ease
[14:29] that doesn't say that does it shall
[14:31] suffer persecution
[14:33] shall suffer persecution but evil man
[14:36] and seducers shall wax worse and worse
[14:39] deceiving and being deceived
[14:41] but watch what he says here but continue
[14:44] thou in the things which thou has
[14:46] learned and has been assured of knowing
[14:49] of whom thou has learned them
[14:51] and and that from a child thou has known
[14:55] the holy scriptures
[14:58] which are able to make thee wise unto
[15:02] salvation through faith which is in
[15:04] Christ Jesus
[15:06] so Paul here is saying that these
[15:08] scriptures will make you wise but they
[15:10] can't they can only work only if you
[15:12] have faith in them as well without faith
[15:15] you can't the scripture can't help you
[15:18] all scripture this is the scripture I
[15:20] want to say all scripture all
[15:23] is given by inspiration of God
[15:28] and this profitable for Doctrine for
[15:31] reproof for correction for instruction
[15:34] and righteousness
[15:36] that the man of God may be perfect
[15:40] thoroughly furnished unto all good works
[15:43] praise the Lord Jesus let's just borrow
[15:45] our heads our heavenly father we just
[15:47] thank you once again for the opportunity
[15:48] to open back the pages of your word we
[15:51] ask that you would forgive us first of
[15:52] all Lord for our sins any iniquities
[15:55] Lord God cleanse his father for
[15:57] sometimes we we get out of Step Lord we
[16:00] Heir father in the way Lord through our
[16:02] thoughts through with the things we do
[16:04] the things we say we ask you father for
[16:06] forgiveness now Lord we pray Lord that
[16:08] you would cleanse us father from all
[16:10] unrighteousness and we ask that you
[16:12] would just help us here tonight Lord as
[16:13] we Endeavor to just open back the pages
[16:16] of your word and just look at this hear
[16:18] father God of the assurance that you've
[16:20] given us through your through your
[16:21] scriptures Lord God help us father to
[16:24] leave here edified and you glorified
[16:25] Lord for we ask these things now in
[16:27] Jesus Christ's name amen you may be
[16:30] seated
[16:32] amen
[16:35] brother Branham States here in in in in
[16:37] Satan's Eden he's he says this he says
[16:40] that all that's all I know to tell you
[16:42] that this Bible I believe with all my
[16:46] heart if I know my heart to be the
[16:49] perfect
[16:54] unadulterated word of God
[16:58] goodness what a tongue twister there
[17:03] by this I live by this I stand
[17:08] and if I had ten thousand lives so what
[17:11] he says here if I had ten thousand lives
[17:13] in other words if he could live over ten
[17:16] thousand times I'd like to give every
[17:19] bit of it for this word
[17:22] for it's the word of Jesus Christ
[17:25] and I don't care how much they can try
[17:27] to disprove it how much science tries to
[17:30] say it isn't trustworthy and so forth to
[17:34] me it's the only thing in the world I
[17:36] can trust
[17:38] it's this word
[17:40] amen he is mine I love him don't you
[17:43] praise the Lord so there's nothing
[17:45] better that we could put our bank our
[17:47] souls on and in some places brother
[17:49] Baron says where I can Bank my soul on
[17:51] but the word of God
[17:53] the word of God doesn't change his mind
[17:55] God doesn't say one thing at one place
[17:57] and then later on he changes his mind
[17:59] what it says is exactly what it means
[18:04] do you really believe that so sometimes
[18:07] we try to explain something away well it
[18:09] didn't mean that way exactly because see
[18:11] science now tells us I don't think so
[18:15] it means exactly what it says praise the
[18:18] Lord Jesus second Peter 1 16 tells us
[18:21] this it says for we have not followed
[18:24] cunningly devised Fables
[18:28] when we made known unto you this is
[18:30] Peter talking now Peter was an
[18:33] eyewitness of what happened in the life
[18:35] of Jesus so he knew first account he saw
[18:40] the things that he was talking about so
[18:42] he knew what he was talking about
[18:44] but he says here for we have not
[18:46] followed cunningly devised fables in
[18:48] other words stories
[18:50] amen when we made known unto you the
[18:53] power and coming of our Lord Jesus
[18:55] Christ but were eyewitnesses of his
[18:58] majesty
[19:00] you know what Peter Peter was I mean he
[19:03] he went through it all with the life of
[19:05] Jesus he went through the good times
[19:07] with Jesus he went through bad times
[19:09] with Jesus and he went through good and
[19:10] bad times without Jesus
[19:13] I mean just a man that that came to a
[19:16] point where he denied Jesus three times
[19:19] fulfilling what Jesus had said to him
[19:21] directly that that's what you were going
[19:23] to do and he said I won't do it and he
[19:26] did it
[19:27] and he kept he ca he that followed I'm
[19:30] sure followed him all the rest of his
[19:32] life but you know what Jesus never
[19:34] rubbed that in his face
[19:37] he just said you're just you just
[19:39] fulfilled what I told you you fulfilled
[19:41] my word
[19:43] so so what a wonderful thing and Peter
[19:47] here is a witness for he says here for
[19:49] he received from God
[19:51] the father honor and Glory when there
[19:54] came such a voice to him from the
[19:55] excellent Glory this is my beloved Son
[19:57] in whom I am well pleased this is
[19:59] talking about Jesus and this voice which
[20:01] came from heaven we heard when we were
[20:04] with him in the Holy mount
[20:06] we also we have also a more sure word of
[20:10] Prophecy what he says here we have also
[20:14] a more sure word of Prophecy
[20:19] now you say you might you might you
[20:21] might think well the the New Testament I
[20:25] don't know if I can if I can trust it
[20:27] and I don't even know if I could trust
[20:28] the Old Testament but Jesus trusted the
[20:31] Old Testament enough because part really
[20:34] he quoted it many many times
[20:36] so if you can't believe Jesus
[20:39] then you really don't believe the Old
[20:41] Testament either
[20:42] because because for one Jesus is the
[20:45] word that went through the Old Testament
[20:47] right
[20:49] and then here he is in the form of the
[20:52] Holy Spirit speaking through these men
[20:53] here in the New Testament
[20:55] so it's Jesus Christ from Genesis to
[20:57] revelation
[20:59] amen
[21:00] we have also a more sure word of
[21:02] Prophecy where unto ye do well watch
[21:05] that you do what you do well that ye
[21:07] take heed
[21:09] in other words you listen
[21:11] and you and you you and you you listen
[21:13] to it as unto a light that shineth in a
[21:16] dark place until the day Dawn and the
[21:18] day star rise in your hearts knowing
[21:20] this first
[21:21] that no Prophecy of the scripture
[21:25] let me say that again that no Prophecy
[21:27] of the scripture No No scripture or no
[21:30] Bible verse is of any private
[21:33] interpretation what does that mean
[21:35] it means that it didn't come privately
[21:38] or somebody just thought of just writing
[21:41] that
[21:42] no
[21:44] somebody lived it out
[21:46] and then it happened and somebody penned
[21:48] it out
[21:49] and we're going to take a look here at
[21:51] some things as to what will help you to
[21:53] know why can I trust the scriptures why
[21:57] can I trust the Bible
[22:00] for the prophecy came not in Old Time by
[22:03] the will of man so it wasn't it no man
[22:06] ever thought about the word of God the
[22:09] way it's written right
[22:11] nobody ever found the word of God hidden
[22:14] under a rock somewhere and say well
[22:16] we're just going to publish this book we
[22:18] found another book never
[22:21] because too many I mean the word of God
[22:23] has changed lives and there the fact
[22:26] that that it causes people to die for
[22:28] this word
[22:30] something is something is taking place
[22:33] I mean there was thousands millions of
[22:35] people that are actually willing to give
[22:37] up their life they weren't just dragged
[22:40] to to the to the Stables or to the
[22:43] crosses to get hung they willingly
[22:45] walked in there and said for this I die
[22:48] for this I stand just as brother Brandon
[22:50] was saying
[22:52] the question is are you willing to do
[22:54] that
[22:56] or will something happen or take place
[22:58] or come to your life that
[23:02] would want to make you not even stand
[23:04] for this word the way you should
[23:08] my
[23:09] father prophecy came not in Old Time by
[23:12] the will of man but holy man
[23:14] of God's spake
[23:16] as they were moved by the Holy Ghost
[23:20] amen
[23:21] now these are these are eyewitness
[23:23] accounts of the life of Jesus this is
[23:25] Luke right here uh in Luke chapter one
[23:28] and I'm just kind of putting this as a
[23:30] foundation I'm I'll read a little
[23:32] quicker and comment less Luke 1 1-4 says
[23:35] for as much as many have taken in hand
[23:38] to set forth an order a declaration of
[23:41] those things which are most surely
[23:43] believed Among Us so they believed these
[23:46] things even as they delivered them unto
[23:49] us which from the beginning were
[23:51] eyewitnesses and Ministers of the word
[23:54] it seemed good to me also haven't had
[23:56] perfect understanding of all things from
[23:59] the very first to write unto thee in
[24:01] order most excellent Theophilus that
[24:03] thou mightest know this is why he's
[24:06] writing that that Luke was writing his
[24:09] biography I said biography or of Jesus
[24:14] right that thou what was it
[24:18] biography that thou mightest know the
[24:22] certainty of those things wherein thou
[24:24] has been instructed amen so Luke wasn't
[24:27] one of the disciples
[24:29] he he wasn't probably there like maybe
[24:31] Peter was the whole time
[24:33] amen so how did Luke get all of these
[24:36] things
[24:37] amen must have been that the Holy Spirit
[24:39] was at work because the Holy Spirit
[24:41] knows all things
[24:43] amen and the Holy Spirit is that word
[24:45] which is Jesus Christ
[24:47] amen praise the Lord Jesus so
[24:51] so let's look here at some at some at
[24:53] some history here now the word bible it
[24:56] comes from the Latin word which is
[24:58] Biblia
[24:59] Biblia and that's actually the Spanish
[25:01] word for Bible
[25:03] that's why it's easy for me to remember
[25:05] that
[25:06] comes from the Latin word bible which
[25:08] means a collection of books
[25:10] that's what that word means so that's
[25:12] where we get the word bibliotech
[25:14] which is a library right we use
[25:18] biblioteca in Spanish
[25:20] and so that that that's the word bible
[25:23] now ask this question why why should I
[25:26] trust the Bible
[25:28] why should I trust the Bible young
[25:31] people I know that sometimes the Devil
[25:33] comes and he comes to you directly and
[25:35] says why you've been in you've been
[25:37] going to church and listening to the to
[25:38] the word of God the message you listen
[25:40] to all this why should I even trust it
[25:44] isn't it just like any other book that's
[25:46] written out there isn't it just
[25:48] what is it what if some man just just
[25:52] happened to just just just start making
[25:54] things up and just writing things down
[25:58] let's change too many lives for that to
[26:01] just been just by coincidence and it's
[26:04] still changing lives
[26:06] amen
[26:08] there has never been one person that
[26:10] that that has never been exposed to the
[26:13] word of God that hasn't had some sort of
[26:16] change
[26:17] either for the positive or the negative
[26:19] the word of God changes amen because
[26:22] listen if you if you accept the word
[26:24] it'll be a blessing to you if you reject
[26:27] the word it'll become a curse to you
[26:31] amen
[26:32] so either way it's going to have an
[26:35] effect on you
[26:36] amen tell me what book in in this world
[26:39] can do that
[26:41] Edgar Allan's Poe's writings that they
[26:44] ever do anything like that no they make
[26:47] you scared
[26:48] and they make you think of a man who man
[26:51] that that dude is a is a freak
[26:56] have you ever read after Allen's post
[26:58] stuff I mean it's we used to read the
[27:00] things in in in in uh in high school
[27:02] they would make us write read those
[27:04] things and write something about it it
[27:06] was something weird in that dude's mind
[27:08] but they glorify Edgar Allan Poe like
[27:11] he's just this great thing and then you
[27:12] talk about Jesus Christ and his word ah
[27:15] we don't know about that hey girl and
[27:17] Poe is much more popular than than Jesus
[27:21] amen the writings of Plato the writings
[27:23] of of of all these different uh you know
[27:27] you look at those writings and and and
[27:29] and and and they're they seem to be more
[27:32] popular than than Jesus on the surface
[27:35] but the Bible has been the most uh sold
[27:40] book that there ever has has been
[27:43] right so
[27:44] so why should I trust the Bible well for
[27:47] one there's archaeological evidence
[27:50] Genesis and an exodus
[27:53] there's archaeological evidence of the
[27:55] things that was said people have gone
[27:57] back
[27:58] and actually have seen what the Bible
[28:02] talks about I can think of Sodom and
[28:04] Gomorrah Sodom and Gomorrah right there
[28:07] exactly the way the Bible talks about it
[28:09] they that you can go over there and
[28:12] actually pick up the sulfur balls and
[28:14] the things that fell from you might have
[28:15] to dig them out a little bit but there's
[28:17] videos on YouTube you can go look and
[28:19] people set fire to them and everything
[28:23] sulfur balls get I can't even talk
[28:26] tonight
[28:27] sulfur balls get there
[28:29] in the scripture amen exactly didn't
[28:33] what happened there didn't happen you
[28:37] know it was said in the scripture
[28:40] as I said it's the best-selling book of
[28:42] all time
[28:43] um
[28:44] another example is that you know the Red
[28:47] Sea Crossing
[28:49] I don't know if you there's there's
[28:50] there's documentaries where they've
[28:52] actually found the possible places where
[28:54] where the the children of Israel have
[28:57] crossed and they've actually have found
[29:00] like chariot wheels and things right
[29:02] there at the bottom of the ocean
[29:04] so I mean how did that get there you see
[29:10] so
[29:12] so it's just it's like I said it's not
[29:14] just a book that somebody just just
[29:16] happened to just find and they're a Rock
[29:18] Amen
[29:19] amen but it's something that's actually
[29:21] changing lives if you take it to heart
[29:23] if you have faith in it praise the Lord
[29:26] now here's here's one thing that you can
[29:29] you can look at
[29:31] with regards to the word of God
[29:34] and it's the honesty test
[29:37] the honesty test
[29:39] now the writers of the of the of the
[29:42] Bible
[29:44] if if they wanted to lie
[29:47] if they wanted to say just make up all
[29:50] these things and say just all kinds of
[29:52] lies to you
[29:54] why not just say beautiful things and
[29:57] nice things about themselves
[29:59] the whole time
[30:02] no instead we find Moses who is one of
[30:05] the writers of the Bible writing things
[30:09] about himself that you probably would
[30:11] not even mentioned about about about
[30:13] yourself remember he wrote the first I
[30:16] believe it was the first five books of
[30:18] the of the Bible
[30:19] and and there you'll find where where
[30:22] Moses
[30:23] he wrote where he was supposed to speak
[30:25] to the Rock instead he got upset and
[30:29] struck The Rock
[30:30] and because of that he was not able to
[30:32] go into the Promised Land
[30:34] Exodus I believe is Exodus that tells us
[30:37] about that
[30:38] who wrote that Moses himself
[30:41] so he wrote something negative about
[30:43] himself
[30:45] you take for example uh uh uh
[30:49] uh let's see uh when the John you know
[30:53] when when he was when when he was
[30:55] talking about that the disciples were
[30:57] arguing with each other about who's the
[30:59] greatest in the Kingdom
[31:01] they were fussing with each other about
[31:03] who's the greatest in the Kingdom but
[31:05] that's there for our our benefit right
[31:08] but they would write negative things
[31:10] about their experiences as well look at
[31:12] Paul
[31:13] he wrote about himself going and
[31:15] persecuting the Christians and killing
[31:17] them
[31:18] what good writer I mean what writer
[31:21] would write things about himself that
[31:23] way
[31:24] I mean I would just write just nice
[31:26] flowery things I mean just the way
[31:27] people do it on Facebook nowadays
[31:30] they show a a a a a an image of yourself
[31:33] that it's really not you all right
[31:37] but these these writers of the word
[31:39] didn't write just flowery beautiful
[31:42] things about themselves or their
[31:44] experiences they wrote negative things
[31:46] as well
[31:47] amen
[31:48] so that is one of the reasons why you
[31:51] can trust the word of God
[31:53] because these writers were honest about
[31:56] their experiences about the things that
[31:58] they went through I just didn't I just
[32:01] didn't see Miracles I also failed the
[32:03] Lord Jesus I did not the Lord Jesus
[32:05] three times
[32:07] can you imagine the shame and we never
[32:10] find Peter where he rebuked any of the
[32:13] writers of of the four gospels and told
[32:16] him don't write that about me don't put
[32:18] that in there
[32:19] don't put that in there no
[32:22] he let them amen amen because that's God
[32:24] inspired
[32:26] see Peter didn't understand me that he
[32:28] was doing that but it was to be written
[32:31] for our benefit today
[32:33] and so sometimes Saints you might find
[32:36] why am I why why have I am I in this
[32:39] situation I have fallen in this
[32:40] situation I'm in this situation but God
[32:43] might use that for a benefit for
[32:44] somebody else later on
[32:47] Peter's downfall Peter's uh uh occasion
[32:52] of of of that caused him to cry
[32:55] it became a blessing to you and me
[32:59] amen if we make a mistake
[33:02] Jesus won't rub it in our face
[33:06] amen he's willing to forgive praise the
[33:09] Lord
[33:10] and we could look through all the
[33:11] scriptures Hosea he wrote about himself
[33:13] what did Hosea do Hosea wrote about
[33:16] himself asking God asked him to marry a
[33:20] prostitute
[33:21] man that's in the Bible yeah
[33:24] now there was a purpose for that you
[33:25] just go back in the Bible and read it
[33:28] but he wrote that about himself about
[33:31] his experience amen
[33:33] praise the Lord amen and then of course
[33:36] Paul persecuted the Christians
[33:38] and all these men they gave their time
[33:40] and their lives for the faith of Jesus
[33:43] Christ amen
[33:45] praise the Lord Jesus
[33:49] and in looking at some of for example
[33:51] the the way the the the disciples some
[33:53] of the disciples the way they died
[33:55] some of them died horrible deaths
[33:58] think about it
[33:59] Peter was crucified it was crucified and
[34:03] he told them don't crucify me the way my
[34:05] Lord was crucified he said crucify me
[34:07] upside down
[34:08] that's how that's how much he was
[34:10] willing to die and if they were telling
[34:13] lies
[34:14] why not just recant right there and say
[34:17] oh no I don't believe this God this
[34:19] Jesus and I don't want to you know they
[34:20] were willing to die for it
[34:24] they were willing to die
[34:27] so if there's you could go back and read
[34:29] the Histories on on on the disciples on
[34:31] the way they die I believe the only one
[34:33] that died of old age or natural was John
[34:36] was John
[34:38] I think he died was like 90 something
[34:40] years old all the other ones they were
[34:42] they were persecuted they were they were
[34:44] they were they died horrible deaths
[34:47] so to me Saints that tells me amen that
[34:51] these Arthur these authors of the Bible
[34:53] these authors of this of the gospels
[34:55] they were more concerned about truth
[34:56] than they were about themselves
[34:59] they were more concerned about giving
[35:01] you the truth than they were about their
[35:03] own even their own lives
[35:05] so young people that's the one of the
[35:07] reasons why you can't trust the word of
[35:09] God
[35:10] don't Satan comes around saying that's
[35:12] just a man's book you you get no it's
[35:15] it's the word inspired breathed out word
[35:18] of God
[35:19] praise the Lord Jesus
[35:21] all right there's another test that we
[35:23] can we can look at and and that is that
[35:25] is what it's called the time Gap test
[35:29] and it's the time for when when the
[35:32] author wrote the original manuscript to
[35:35] the time of a copy of that manuscript
[35:38] was written
[35:39] amen so when the Bible was written let's
[35:42] say let's just think about the The Book
[35:44] of Luke when the Book of Luke was
[35:45] written to the time that it was written
[35:48] until the time that there was a copy of
[35:50] that manuscript amen there wasn't but
[35:53] Pro less than 50 years that had took
[35:56] place because remember when some back
[35:58] then when they would copy things it
[36:00] wasn't through text message and it
[36:01] wasn't through email it was handwritten
[36:04] somebody had to look at the original
[36:06] manuscripts and to make copies of the of
[36:09] the manuscripts of the Bible they had to
[36:11] sit there and pen that manually
[36:15] so if you let a lot of time pass by from
[36:18] the time that the original manuscript
[36:21] took place was written to the time that
[36:24] a copy came to be written if there's a
[36:27] lot is there if there's a great wide Gap
[36:29] there then there's things that are going
[36:31] to be missing
[36:32] there's things that are allowable to be
[36:34] missing but the word of God is in that
[36:36] that way it's about less than 50 years
[36:39] amen that from the time that let's just
[36:42] say the Book of Luke that that the the
[36:45] manuscript of the gospels was was
[36:47] written the copies of it was written
[36:49] then
[36:50] yeah right it's kind of it's kind of
[36:52] interesting too that the message of the
[36:54] hour the message that God's given us
[36:56] you see how quickly it was transcribed
[37:00] it wasn't transcribed now my wife she
[37:03] knows all about transcription because
[37:05] that's what she does
[37:07] it's not an easy job
[37:09] if you think that sitting there
[37:11] listening and and typing
[37:13] especially listening to brother Brandon
[37:16] is is tough and I'm just thankful for
[37:19] these Brethren that took their time to
[37:21] do that these sisters that do that that
[37:23] we can now read the message
[37:26] and not just not just here amen praise
[37:29] the Lord so but but during that time
[37:31] that the message was was was was was you
[37:34] know brother Branham preached the
[37:36] message it wasn't too long after that
[37:38] that it was put put in text in text
[37:41] amen now you can look here for example
[37:44] there was a Roman historian by the name
[37:47] of Pliny the Younger
[37:49] the time Gap from when he wrote his
[37:52] manuscripts to the copies that that we
[37:54] have now 750 years passed
[37:59] but he's an authority
[38:01] he's he's a popular historian the time
[38:05] Gap that we have of Caesar's writings
[38:07] to now to the to the manuscripts that of
[38:11] his original writings to the to the
[38:13] copies is a thousand years that had
[38:15] passed
[38:16] Plato's time gap of his writings is 1200
[38:19] years
[38:20] and then Alexander the greats time Gap
[38:23] is 400 years
[38:25] but the Bibles was less than 50 years
[38:28] but we say well these men existed
[38:31] Alexander the Great existed Plato and
[38:34] all these men they they existed but I
[38:37] don't know about Jesus I don't know
[38:38] about him
[38:40] you see how the devil works
[38:42] I don't know if we can trust what he
[38:44] said you know
[38:47] but we'll read Plato and Alexander the
[38:49] Great and and and all these all these
[38:52] men all day long
[38:54] praise the Lord
[38:56] amen they no nobody questions these
[38:58] historical figures existence
[39:00] but but when it comes to Jesus he's he's
[39:03] questioned whether he existed or not
[39:07] amen praise God now another test that we
[39:09] can do is how many manuscripts are
[39:11] available all you know about Caesar is
[39:14] that only 10 there's only 10 manuscripts
[39:16] of his writings all right I know this is
[39:18] kind of just bear with me okay we're
[39:20] getting to something we're getting to
[39:22] something oh there's only about 10
[39:24] manuscripts of his writing about Plato's
[39:26] it's about seven manuscripts of his
[39:28] writings
[39:29] hey man there's a there was a Roman
[39:31] historian by the name of tacitus
[39:34] he had 20 manuscripts guess how many
[39:37] manuscripts the Bible has
[39:40] and why don't I don't want to take a
[39:41] guess
[39:43] by the way
[39:48] twenty four thousand six hundred and
[39:50] thirty three
[39:52] manuscripts of the word
[39:55] there are available
[39:57] and the number keeps going up
[39:59] right
[40:01] the second most manuscripts there are
[40:03] available out there for any book is the
[40:06] is The Iliad written by Homer
[40:09] and and that has only 643 manuscripts
[40:13] that that is a difference of 23 990.
[40:17] the Bible has many more manuscripts
[40:21] so these manuscripts and and these
[40:24] things have been passed down from the
[40:26] and God has guarded these things
[40:30] so that we can enjoy it today in in this
[40:32] book form so that we can enjoy it today
[40:35] in even in tablet form
[40:37] praise God amen
[40:41] so you don't tell me that Jesus Christ
[40:43] is not more popular than Homer
[40:46] [Laughter]
[40:48] I I I can't nobody died for Homer but
[40:51] somebody died for Jesus Christ
[40:53] amen throughout throughout time
[40:55] and then there's another there's another
[40:57] thing that you can look at is the
[40:59] corroboration test do what are there
[41:01] other historical materials or writings
[41:03] that corroborate or deny the testimony
[41:06] of the Bible
[41:08] and in looking into this there's there
[41:11] are nine non-Christian sources and 33
[41:14] Christian sources that mention Jesus
[41:15] within 150 years of his death
[41:18] so there's other sources outside of the
[41:21] Bible that mention Jesus and his life
[41:24] all right
[41:26] so there's about 42 known sources that
[41:28] we know that
[41:30] Tiberius Caesar and the Roman Emperor at
[41:32] the time of Jesus lived he had only 10
[41:35] sources that mention him within the 150
[41:37] years of his life
[41:39] amen but we say he's more real than
[41:41] Jesus is
[41:42] no I don't think so Jesus hadn't he had
[41:45] more four times more resources amen
[41:50] so we know that outside of the Bible
[41:52] that Jesus lived performed Miracles and
[41:55] that people believed on him
[41:57] outside of the Bible there's there's
[41:59] cooperation of that now let's have let
[42:02] me ask you this question why is the
[42:04] Bible in letter form
[42:05] [Music]
[42:08] why can't Jesus why can't the Lord just
[42:11] given it to us in video format from the
[42:13] beginning
[42:15] why couldn't he just give it to us in
[42:17] images
[42:19] GIFs
[42:21] animated gifs
[42:23] and we like to text with animated gifs
[42:26] nowadays
[42:27] why can't why can't they be in that way
[42:31] and I want to give you all an example
[42:34] so we got props today
[42:38] if the brothers could pull pull
[42:42] my phone up a bit on mine
[42:53] all right
[42:55] let's see okay
[42:59] all right
[43:00] here's this picture right here
[43:04] and I want someone to tell me
[43:06] who these people are
[43:12] can somebody just take a guess yes sir
[43:16] Mary and Joseph by looking at that
[43:19] picture you think Mary Joseph okay
[43:21] all right anybody else one
[43:27] Josh
[43:30] just whatever whatever comes to your
[43:32] mind that that is
[43:37] okay it says me and Sister Christine
[43:41] all right sister Anna Canard what do you
[43:43] think
[43:45] just uh just a a cup a couple okay a
[43:50] couple
[43:51] all right what if I told you
[43:54] that
[43:55] it's a brother and a sister named Tommy
[43:58] and Caitlin on a trip to Spain
[44:02] with each of their own families
[44:05] while each of their families were
[44:07] sightseeing
[44:08] Caitlyn asked Tommy's wife Andrea if she
[44:12] could take a picture of her and her
[44:14] brother since they don't have many
[44:15] pictures together and haven't taken one
[44:18] together in a long time
[44:21] so Andrea did
[44:22] let's just say if this was a picture
[44:25] now how do you know that's true
[44:31] there's got to be an element of Faith
[44:33] there now
[44:34] do you know that I that I looked at this
[44:37] picture and I'm the one who made that up
[44:42] because that's what I saw when I saw
[44:44] that picture
[44:46] but you see you took my word for it
[44:49] man
[44:54] that's why so sometimes we just have to
[44:55] take the word of God in that same way
[44:58] why is it that the Lord didn't give us
[45:01] the word of God in picture form
[45:04] because there will be all these
[45:05] different interpretations of what of
[45:08] what certain something is
[45:11] whereas in text you just saw that I
[45:14] could get details
[45:16] exactly of what that of what that was
[45:19] well what was in my mind
[45:21] and what we read in the word of God is
[45:23] what was in the mind of God
[45:26] you see hot why why it's so important to
[45:28] read
[45:31] God could have given us us to us in a
[45:34] different format but he chose to give it
[45:36] to us in text form
[45:38] because it could be in more details
[45:41] all right and it could also produce an
[45:43] image in your mind as you're reading
[45:45] right it transcends you to the to the
[45:48] place there's some places in the word of
[45:50] God that you're reading and it goes into
[45:52] details
[45:54] and it's almost like if you're there
[45:56] right
[45:59] praise the Lord I want to play this
[46:01] video right here I want you to tell me
[46:03] somebody tell me what they what what
[46:04] they think it is
[46:21] yeah there is a doggie underneath there
[46:26] all right
[46:30] Bella what do you think it is
[46:34] you
[46:36] no guess
[46:39] anybody want to take one guess just one
[46:41] guess
[46:42] brother Wade
[46:44] father and a daughter
[46:46] okay you got father and a daughter
[46:51] what if I told you
[46:53] that this was a brother and a sister
[46:57] sitting together at a park bench
[47:00] the sister is trying to comfort her
[47:02] brother as he talks to him
[47:05] because
[47:07] as he talks to her because he just lost
[47:10] his wife due to cancer a few weeks prior
[47:14] the sister understands what her brother
[47:16] is going through because she had lost
[47:18] her husband in a car accident
[47:20] and she was left a widow four years
[47:22] prior
[47:25] so you couldn't get all those details
[47:26] just watching that video
[47:29] you see what I'm saying but I just read
[47:31] you in text form or something I just
[47:33] made up
[47:36] but you you believed it right
[47:42] same thing with the word of God
[47:44] why that's why the word of God is so
[47:46] important that it's in text format
[47:49] amen
[47:50] all right
[47:52] and then here's picture number three
[48:01] I don't even know what that picture is
[48:08] yeah yeah I was giving Joe a massage
[48:11] that's what he does
[48:14] hahaha
[48:18] all right well hopefully I woke some of
[48:20] you up
[48:20] [Laughter]
[48:23] amen
[48:24] [Music]
[48:27] it definitely wasn't recent the Joe Joe
[48:29] looks a little younger there
[48:37] all right
[48:38] so does the point come across as to why
[48:42] reading the word of God is so important
[48:44] and why thank God that He gave it to us
[48:46] in text form
[48:48] amen
[48:49] now let's talk about the alive word amen
[48:52] why the alive word is still so relevant
[48:54] for us today amen second Timothy chapter
[48:57] 3 tells us this verse 16 oh we we just
[49:01] read it but we're ready to hear again
[49:02] all scripture is given by inspiration of
[49:05] God
[49:07] and is profitable for Doctrine for
[49:10] reproof for correction for instruction
[49:12] in righteousness that the man of God may
[49:16] be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all
[49:19] good works now we know that what makes
[49:21] perfect is the holy spirit amen but what
[49:24] the holy spirit is in his word amen he
[49:28] the word is is the Holy Ghost amen
[49:30] praise God he is his word Jesus said in
[49:33] one place my words are spirit and their
[49:36] life amen so as you receive the word as
[49:40] you read the word the text of the word
[49:42] and you're taking it in by faith then it
[49:45] can do something for you it's breathing
[49:47] life into you Amen in in in in in the
[49:51] NIV version this scripture says it this
[49:53] way it says all scripture is God
[49:55] breathed
[49:57] and is useful for teaching rebuking
[50:00] correcting and training in righteousness
[50:01] and in the ESV version it says all
[50:04] scripture is breathed out
[50:06] by God and profitable for teaching for
[50:09] reproof for Corrections and so forth so
[50:12] all scripture is God breathed which also
[50:16] explains the alive and active word of
[50:18] God Amen
[50:20] it's the alive and active word of God
[50:23] amen meaning that we can take a
[50:26] scripture the scriptures that were
[50:27] written back then
[50:29] during the time of Moses and we can
[50:31] apply it to our lives today
[50:34] we can bring that word all the way from
[50:37] Genesis and put it in some application
[50:40] here in 2022.
[50:42] tell me what book in in the world can do
[50:46] that
[50:46] a book that was written in the 1800s you
[50:50] would not be able to put everything and
[50:52] apply it to our day
[50:54] but the word of God you can
[50:57] amen
[50:58] because why again the word of God is God
[51:02] breathed is alive
[51:05] amen so it's active amen it's working
[51:08] it's changing it's moving God is always
[51:12] moving amen he's never stopping he never
[51:15] he he's never uh uh uh he never stops
[51:19] he's always in motion and that as he
[51:23] moves we move praise God now in thinking
[51:26] about this it takes me back to Genesis 2
[51:28] 7 where God breathed into Adam let's
[51:31] read that real quick and the Lord God
[51:33] formed man of the Dust of the ground and
[51:37] breathed into his nostrils the Breath of
[51:41] Life
[51:42] and Man became a living soul
[51:45] when you look at the at the uh the
[51:47] strongest concordance there the word
[51:49] breathe it means to breathe to blow
[51:53] amen and then where it talks about the
[51:55] breath the breath it's a puff it's the
[51:59] word uh nismat to breathe is the word
[52:03] and and the the breath the nisma a puff
[52:06] wind angry vital breath watch a divine
[52:09] inspiration
[52:12] amen what is the word of God
[52:14] all word of God is inspired
[52:18] amen
[52:20] at divine inspiration intellect an
[52:22] animal
[52:23] of life it's The Word
[52:26] Alive raw fresh strong life
[52:30] and then you take you take where it says
[52:32] there in Genesis 2 7 he became Adam
[52:34] became a living Soul a living is Haya
[52:39] and it's not Haya but it's Haya alive
[52:42] raw fresh strong life
[52:45] and then the word soul is nephesh what's
[52:48] this Soul self-life creature person
[52:51] appetite mind living being desire
[52:53] emotion passion that which breathes the
[52:55] breathing substance or being Soul the
[52:58] inner being of man
[53:00] amen so God actually breathed into him
[53:04] amen gave him his soul praise God in
[53:08] Genesis 2 7. praise the Lord
[53:12] now we're all created by God All Souls
[53:16] are mine says the Lord
[53:18] amen praise God
[53:20] that's your decision
[53:22] if you want that soul to either continue
[53:25] with God or be destroyed at some point
[53:27] in time in your life yeah how horrible
[53:29] it is to one day
[53:32] think that you you exist no more
[53:36] amen and that you can't enjoy the things
[53:39] that are coming Hereafter praise God
[53:41] now I want you to think about this
[53:43] because we see that the scripture amen
[53:45] it it it's inspired amen
[53:49] and and and and look at the difference
[53:52] amen the difference between Adam being
[53:54] alive and the living word amen
[53:59] now I want you to think about this Adam
[54:01] was dead when when God breathed into him
[54:05] I mean he wasn't he wasn't living it
[54:07] wasn't until God breathed into him that
[54:09] he became a living soul
[54:10] right
[54:12] but the scripture is not that way
[54:16] the scripture is alive as it comes out
[54:19] of God
[54:21] praise the Lord Jesus
[54:23] is not it's not dead word
[54:26] it's alive and it's a creative word
[54:29] amen it's not dead so when Paul was said
[54:33] was saying that all scripture was is
[54:36] inspired by God therein all scripture is
[54:39] given by inspiration of God he's not
[54:41] saying that if you read the word then
[54:45] get inspired then that's when the word
[54:47] of God becomes inspiring
[54:49] no the word of God from the beginning
[54:51] from the get-go is already inspired
[54:54] praise the Lord Jesus but now what that
[54:57] word is wanting to do is wanting to come
[54:59] in and and live and come into a vessel
[55:02] to become a Living Word through somebody
[55:05] it's already living it already has life
[55:08] it already can create but now it wants
[55:11] to come in and live itself through you
[55:14] and I through a vessel
[55:16] the best example I could give is
[55:18] probably when in Isaiah chapter 7.
[55:22] that it was prophesied Isaiah said that
[55:25] a virgin shall conceive that word came
[55:28] forth that word was alive when it came
[55:30] forth
[55:31] it just went years and years and that
[55:34] word was still alive
[55:36] it was inspired
[55:39] it was alive and it finally found a
[55:43] vessel that it can rest up in and it was
[55:46] Mary
[55:48] but it was a willing vessel
[55:50] it wasn't just any old good 16 year old
[55:53] girl that was living in Jerusalem or or
[55:55] where Mary lived at the time no it was a
[55:58] willing vessel
[56:00] that that word that was already inspired
[56:02] when it came out of God's mouth Amen to
[56:05] Isaiah and Isaiah penned it down amen it
[56:09] was already alive
[56:10] now we wanted to rest in Mary and Mary
[56:13] could say be it unto me according to Thy
[56:17] word
[56:18] praise the Lord Jesus
[56:21] according to Thy word not my word not my
[56:25] will but according to Thy Word
[56:27] Hallelujah amen praise the Lord Jesus
[56:31] so it's it's the word of God is alive
[56:33] and Powerful
[56:35] when God said let there be light amen it
[56:39] was so right
[56:40] amen it's an alive and active word when
[56:43] it comes forth out of the mouth of God
[56:45] that's why Jesus says that the man
[56:48] should not live by just bread alone
[56:51] that's right that's right but by every
[56:53] word of God that proceeds out of the
[56:56] mouth of God
[56:57] amen praise the Lord amen why
[57:00] because the word of God causes life
[57:04] the same whole that caused Adam to live
[57:08] amen will cause you to live
[57:10] amen amen receive that same Holy Spirit
[57:14] if you can receive that word
[57:17] praise God why is it so the word of God
[57:20] why is it so important that we get in
[57:22] the word of God
[57:24] amen praise the Lord because we're not
[57:27] just dealing with just a dead letter
[57:30] it's in a way I know what sometimes we
[57:33] say it's dead letter and yes it's dead
[57:35] letter if it's not being lived through
[57:38] someone but remember it was God breathed
[57:42] so it's got life
[57:44] amen it's got life now that life amen
[57:47] wants to come into you so that you can
[57:50] replicate that word
[57:52] because I mean here in in the pages of
[57:55] the book it's not going to do anything
[57:58] but it becomes more of an inspiration to
[58:02] someone else
[58:04] if it can come into someone and live
[58:06] through you live through them amen
[58:09] amen and that's the reason why Paul
[58:11] could say
[58:12] in the gospel in Romans he says this he
[58:15] says
[58:16] for I am not ashamed of the gospel of
[58:18] Christ
[58:20] for it is the power of God unto
[58:22] salvation
[58:24] it is a power
[58:26] it was enough power to create the
[58:28] heavens and the Earth
[58:30] and it's enough power to create a man
[58:32] sir or do what it needs to do for your
[58:36] life to everyone that believeth what see
[58:39] Mary had to believe
[58:41] amen then it took action right
[58:45] to the Jew first and also to the Greek
[58:50] for therein is the righteousness of God
[58:53] revealed from Faith to Faith as it is
[58:56] written the just shall live by faith
[58:59] amen
[59:01] praise the Lord Jesus
[59:04] and that's the same thing Saints with
[59:06] the word of God today
[59:09] just as they wanted to find a willing
[59:11] recipient or a willing vessel
[59:13] during the time of Mary it wants to find
[59:16] a resting place
[59:18] in this hour that we live in
[59:21] let the story of what happened the
[59:23] Christmas story let it not just be in
[59:25] the in in in as a story
[59:28] amen bring it down further
[59:31] Lord let that word of God Amen live in
[59:34] me
[59:35] let me give birth to this word
[59:38] just as Mary gave birth to it in the
[59:40] physical let me give birth to it in the
[59:43] spiritual I want to be not just let me
[59:45] give birth to I want to be born again
[59:48] amen
[59:49] praise the Lord Jesus
[59:53] let it be something active and living
[59:57] and changing me from day to day that as
[1:00:00] I get in the word of God Amen that it's
[1:00:03] not just me trying to get through a a
[1:00:06] whole year of the Bible reading but it's
[1:00:10] letting that that Bible get through me
[1:00:13] amen and living through me and changing
[1:00:16] me praise God
[1:00:20] amen sometimes we just want to read the
[1:00:22] word of God and just uh today's this
[1:00:24] this scripture reading and then okay I
[1:00:27] fulfilled my duty for today
[1:00:30] is it is it alive in you
[1:00:33] what can you go immediately and put it
[1:00:36] into action
[1:00:38] because that's what the word of God
[1:00:40] wants us to do amen praise the Lord
[1:00:44] Jesus
[1:00:45] amen
[1:00:46] brother Brown says this here in the mark
[1:00:48] of the beast
[1:00:50] he says in 1956 and then it ought not to
[1:00:53] be approached by some mental theology it
[1:00:55] should be approached by the scripture
[1:00:57] scripture must answer to scripture
[1:00:59] we realize that reading the Bible you do
[1:01:02] not read it like you would a newspaper
[1:01:05] or a magazine or or or or anything that
[1:01:09] you you enjoy reading back then it was
[1:01:11] newspapers because it's been the wisdom
[1:01:14] of the Holy Spirit to hide many things
[1:01:16] from the eyes of the wise and prudent
[1:01:19] and we reveal it to babes such as would
[1:01:21] learn
[1:01:22] God wants somebody who's hungry
[1:01:26] watch this now God wants somebody who's
[1:01:28] hungry
[1:01:31] so he can just take them over to one
[1:01:34] side and set them down and say here it
[1:01:36] is child of mine This Is It
[1:01:39] isn't that what he did with Mary
[1:01:43] took her to the side
[1:01:46] this is what this is what's going to be
[1:01:49] you've been chosen
[1:01:52] beloved
[1:01:53] right amen that's what God can do for
[1:01:56] you
[1:01:57] take you to the side and reveal things
[1:02:00] to you that you've never even even
[1:02:02] thought of
[1:02:04] that are heading in his word if you
[1:02:07] could just take the time to do it
[1:02:11] I'm telling you Saints there's so much
[1:02:13] open in the word of God there's so much
[1:02:15] in the word of God that we still not not
[1:02:17] not not not getting
[1:02:19] for one of the reasons why we're still
[1:02:21] here
[1:02:22] right
[1:02:23] praise God something that we're not
[1:02:26] still getting amen
[1:02:28] praise God
[1:02:32] so God wants somebody who's hungry so he
[1:02:35] can just take them over to one side and
[1:02:37] set them down and say here it is child
[1:02:38] of mine this is it the world don't
[1:02:41] understand this but ye shall understand
[1:02:42] see let it be this way then all
[1:02:46] scripture given by inspiration then it
[1:02:49] must be interpreted by inspiration
[1:02:52] amen and then scripture must compare
[1:02:55] with scripture
[1:02:56] you try to that they have given
[1:02:59] challenges to people about I'll
[1:03:03] you know tell me where the Bible
[1:03:06] contradicts itself
[1:03:08] and nobody can fight nobody can
[1:03:10] can show that there may be some areas
[1:03:13] that you may look like in that from the
[1:03:15] natural human eye it looks like it's
[1:03:18] contradicting itself but that's the
[1:03:19] reason why we need revelation
[1:03:22] amen Revelation just opens the curtain
[1:03:25] up and lets you see everything clearly
[1:03:28] yeah amen and who can give Revelation
[1:03:31] the Holy Ghost
[1:03:33] amen who's the one that that that has
[1:03:36] inspired this word brother Brandon says
[1:03:38] here now we have take now we could take
[1:03:40] that from a dozen different angles
[1:03:42] tonight of being the Jewish nation that
[1:03:44] was cursed and many every word of God
[1:03:48] written is inspiration and it hooks the
[1:03:51] whole Bible together on every word in
[1:03:54] the Bible it's the most wonderful book
[1:03:56] that was ever written
[1:03:58] there's never a piece of literature ever
[1:04:00] written like the Bible it's the only
[1:04:03] book in existence tells you where you
[1:04:05] come from who you are and where you're
[1:04:08] going
[1:04:09] tell me tell me what other writer can
[1:04:12] tell you that
[1:04:14] amen
[1:04:16] tell me what what what what Max Lucado
[1:04:19] can can can tell you that
[1:04:22] all right Edgar Allan Poe or or Mark
[1:04:25] Twain
[1:04:26] all right I can never tell you where
[1:04:30] you're going they can entertain you for
[1:04:31] a while
[1:04:33] and Max Lucado he can maybe help you
[1:04:36] spirit in some spiritual areas you know
[1:04:38] I'm not saying his his information is
[1:04:40] bad
[1:04:41] but the one that can hold the destiny of
[1:04:45] your future is the word of God
[1:04:47] because those writings that I've just
[1:04:49] mentioned they're not alive
[1:04:51] they're not active Max lucado's writings
[1:04:55] if we if we're here 200 more years amen
[1:04:57] they probably may be obsolete then
[1:05:01] not the word of God the word of God
[1:05:03] right now is fresh it's good for this
[1:05:05] time if we're here 200 more years the
[1:05:07] people that are living then they'll be
[1:05:09] able to benefit from it just as much
[1:05:12] what an awesome word that we've really
[1:05:13] served amen praise God
[1:05:18] we've got libraries full and streets
[1:05:20] full and
[1:05:21] full but never
[1:05:23] of them not none of them none of their
[1:05:26] great philosophers that's raised and
[1:05:28] Fallen they have ever never been able to
[1:05:31] tell us what this Bible has told us
[1:05:34] and all true science moves right back to
[1:05:37] the Bible for its evidence
[1:05:40] amen I bet it's very interesting that
[1:05:42] that brother Brown and puts that in
[1:05:43] there
[1:05:45] amen all right we're gonna relieve
[1:05:48] science are we going to believe the
[1:05:49] Bible
[1:05:51] I'd rather believe the Bible
[1:05:54] amen science got it wrong gay men back
[1:05:57] in the days of Noah I wonder if that's
[1:05:59] not the same thing that's happening
[1:06:00] today
[1:06:03] sometimes we got our Gods amen our our
[1:06:06] government gods that are probably
[1:06:08] telling us not even the truth that's
[1:06:11] right I wonder if that that's why Jesus
[1:06:13] didn't say that if if it wasn't like
[1:06:15] this the days of Noah that today is like
[1:06:18] the days of Noah
[1:06:20] everybody's looking up to the sky
[1:06:23] looking for aliens I'm looking for all
[1:06:25] kinds of stuff they got something ready
[1:06:27] for you yeah you just you you wait and
[1:06:30] see
[1:06:31] and it ain't what they're telling you
[1:06:33] right now
[1:06:34] so are you going to hold on to the word
[1:06:36] of God
[1:06:38] are you gonna hold on to NASA are you
[1:06:40] going to hold on to to science
[1:06:44] just think about it
[1:06:47] amen
[1:06:49] I wanna I wanna give this example amen
[1:06:51] and
[1:06:53] you know sometimes we we we look at the
[1:06:57] word and
[1:06:58] and you maybe you might still be
[1:07:00] thinking well I mean I don't know I
[1:07:02] still don't know if I could trust it you
[1:07:04] know but
[1:07:10] but let's say you receive a text message
[1:07:13] from someone on your phone
[1:07:16] right
[1:07:18] it's got it's a it's a it's a strange
[1:07:21] number and you've never you've never
[1:07:22] seen that number before like we a lot of
[1:07:25] us get text messages nowadays
[1:07:28] saying hi
[1:07:30] you better watch it
[1:07:32] to me when I get those text messages
[1:07:34] it's time to play
[1:07:39] it's time to have fun
[1:07:42] oh yeah and I've had some some
[1:07:43] interesting conversations with some of
[1:07:45] them and they and you know what they
[1:07:46] turn out to be they turn out to be
[1:07:48] people from the Middle East India
[1:07:51] that they somehow they got your phone
[1:07:54] number and they're just trying to be
[1:07:55] able to get something out of you
[1:07:57] right so when somebody says hey hi who's
[1:08:01] this oh isn't this isn't this uh Steve
[1:08:05] or whatever you know they're trying to
[1:08:06] start initiate a conversation
[1:08:09] I had one one the other day that wasn't
[1:08:11] I initiated a conversation with and uh
[1:08:14] the uh
[1:08:15] the the conversation went into a to a
[1:08:18] point where he started he started
[1:08:21] cursing and he started
[1:08:23] and I knew right then that it wasn't it
[1:08:26] wasn't an Asian
[1:08:28] it wasn't in China it wasn't because I I
[1:08:31] mean I've been around Asian people long
[1:08:33] enough that I just I just know that
[1:08:34] they're not that way they're very
[1:08:36] they're very but but and I'm not saying
[1:08:40] this just just understand me
[1:08:43] Indian people and and people like that
[1:08:46] they they kind of tend to be more that
[1:08:48] way you see a little bit more abrupt
[1:08:50] than the way they speak so that's why I
[1:08:52] thought that maybe hey it might be it
[1:08:54] might be someone like that sure enough
[1:08:55] it was
[1:08:57] it was somebody from I believe it was
[1:08:59] Pakistan
[1:09:00] and uh and he and it got to a political
[1:09:03] talk
[1:09:05] he said well you Americans you come over
[1:09:07] here and you take over our land and and
[1:09:09] all this stuff and and I don't agree
[1:09:11] with your president and all that stuff I
[1:09:13] said listen I don't agree with him
[1:09:15] either he said well you should go over
[1:09:16] and shoot your president I said listen I
[1:09:20] I even though I disagree with him I mean
[1:09:23] I'm not I'm gonna go and do that
[1:09:25] I said because for one I'm a Christian
[1:09:28] and the word of God prohibits for me to
[1:09:30] do something like that I mean after
[1:09:32] talking longer and he said uh he didn't
[1:09:35] say anything after that yeah
[1:09:39] so but I have fun with these people but
[1:09:42] anyways
[1:09:45] let's say you receive a text message
[1:09:47] it's a no number or whatever and and uh
[1:09:50] and you're like what in the world who is
[1:09:53] this right
[1:09:55] well you have the right to say who is it
[1:09:57] because you don't know the person you
[1:09:59] don't know the number that's writing you
[1:10:02] but what if you receive a text message
[1:10:05] but if I receive a text message from
[1:10:07] Brother Wade he sends me a text message
[1:10:12] and he says something on there
[1:10:15] and I know that it's from Brother Wade
[1:10:17] why because I've had a personal
[1:10:21] relationship with him
[1:10:23] I've got his name
[1:10:26] in my in my contacts
[1:10:30] I know that that's him I know that
[1:10:31] that's his number
[1:10:33] now I don't I don't know if maybe sister
[1:10:35] June took his phone and sent the text
[1:10:37] message but I know that it's coming from
[1:10:39] a reliable source because I have met him
[1:10:43] and I know him personally and I have his
[1:10:46] number
[1:10:47] saved
[1:10:49] in in my life
[1:10:51] the device of my life
[1:10:54] all right
[1:10:56] well that's the same thing with you and
[1:10:58] and God right man God gives us his word
[1:11:02] and to you that don't understand God to
[1:11:05] you it comes in as a text message that
[1:11:07] you don't understand who's this from I
[1:11:09] don't know it's boring
[1:11:12] amen but if you had a relationship with
[1:11:14] God
[1:11:16] you knew you would know exactly where
[1:11:18] that word's coming from
[1:11:20] you would know that it's the Lord Jesus
[1:11:23] Christ that's the name
[1:11:25] that you have in my in your contacts
[1:11:27] and you would and you would reply to
[1:11:30] that message and you would do it with
[1:11:32] confidence because you know that you are
[1:11:35] replying to a reliable source
[1:11:38] amen
[1:11:40] that's the word of God
[1:11:42] we're not serving cunningly devices or
[1:11:45] fables or anything like that it's the
[1:11:48] true word of God Saints and if the word
[1:11:50] said it I believe it and that settles it
[1:11:53] for me
[1:11:54] amen amen that settles it for me praise
[1:11:58] the Lord Jesus listen even for brother
[1:11:59] Branham he said if I say something
[1:12:01] outside of the word of God he said you
[1:12:04] don't have to take my word he said you
[1:12:06] stay with the absolute amen and the
[1:12:09] absolute wasn't him the absolute is his
[1:12:11] word
[1:12:12] the word of God his word
[1:12:15] brother Branham amen we know that his
[1:12:17] life and the the and what he preached
[1:12:19] amen reflected back from the absolute
[1:12:21] amen
[1:12:24] but if something that brother Branham
[1:12:26] said amen doesn't line up with the word
[1:12:28] I don't have to take what brother
[1:12:29] Brandon said right ah that sounds scary
[1:12:32] I don't know if I should but that's
[1:12:34] what came first amen the Bible or the ma
[1:12:37] or the message
[1:12:39] what was inspired
[1:12:41] right amen now don't get don't get me
[1:12:45] wrong I'm not trying to say anything
[1:12:46] about that because there's there's
[1:12:47] sometimes people bring it as if it's a
[1:12:49] competition I'd rather have the Bible
[1:12:51] than the message or the message before
[1:12:53] the Bible because the message is the
[1:12:54] revelation of this no
[1:12:57] amen there's some things that brother
[1:12:59] Branham said that were his own opinion
[1:13:01] too
[1:13:02] but there was a lot of things with
[1:13:04] regards to the word that was thus said
[1:13:06] the Lord and if you don't receive it
[1:13:09] then you're rejecting God
[1:13:11] amen
[1:13:13] praise the Lord Jesus so
[1:13:16] I want to stay with the word I want to
[1:13:19] stay with the message of the hour
[1:13:21] because I know the message took me back
[1:13:24] to the word
[1:13:25] praise the Lord so a god-breathed word
[1:13:28] produces a god-breathed life
[1:13:31] Amen Let the word of God breathe on you
[1:13:34] tonight amen let's stand to our feet
