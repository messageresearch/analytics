[11:26] Christ's name amen Hal
[11:30] amen you know uh I was uh uh you know uh
[11:36] thinking about what to speak about and I
[11:39] was thinking about about a lot of things
[11:41] that brother B talked about and you know
[11:44] we realized that in this day and age
[11:46] we're standing in a day when the world's
[11:48] falling apart yes sir oh yeah amen you
[11:50] know you say everybody says you know
[11:52] well uh with with Mr Obama taking office
[11:55] again and all and we read some people
[11:58] say well it's a bad choice but you know
[12:01] what choices are there out there we know
[12:04] that we've chosen the right choice and
[12:05] that's Jesus Christ and his word has
[12:08] made a statement that this world's going
[12:11] to fall apart there's nothing we can do
[12:13] to save it we can put the right man we
[12:16] can put an Abraham Lincoln up there
[12:18] right now we can put we can put the the
[12:21] the right man in that place and it's
[12:23] still going to fall apart CU it's th
[12:25] sayith the Lord so we recognize you know
[12:28] that even though it seemed like to me a
[12:31] few months I mean a few years ago four
[12:34] years ago when uh when when Mr Obama
[12:37] took office the world was falling apart
[12:40] you know I saw the the I saw the news
[12:43] and I was watching I saw how the banks
[12:45] were just falling apart and I was afraid
[12:47] that there was going to be a run on the
[12:49] bank like there was in the first
[12:50] depression and they just closed the
[12:52] doors and say you don't got no money you
[12:55] know your money's gone you don't got no
[12:57] money reach out for your retirement you
[13:00] find out oh no we don't got no
[13:02] retirement you reach out for your cars
[13:04] and they say oh the bank's coming to
[13:06] repossess it uh you reach out for your
[13:09] home and they say your house is worth
[13:10] nothing now and that's about where it
[13:13] was going you know I and and and sure he
[13:16] did he did put debt upon debt upon debt
[13:19] you say well it's debt gathered up so
[13:21] high that we never end up paying for it
[13:24] all but you go back to what the prophet
[13:27] said and the prophet said if all staging
[13:30] in place so that the word of God will
[13:33] come to pass that the sellout of this
[13:36] United States will come to pass and it's
[13:39] it's probably already happened you know
[13:41] things happen behind the scene we don't
[13:43] even know it sometimes you you don't
[13:45] realize who's pulling the real levers
[13:47] here you know when when you come when it
[13:49] comes to politics you know you wonder
[13:52] sometimes cuz how can how can can all
[13:54] the banks fail how can all the how can
[13:57] gold go up SC Skyhigh in price how can
[14:01] and and make the gold in the Vatican
[14:03] worth so much more oh yeah how can the
[14:05] how can the whole world's economy start
[14:07] falling apart one after another and
[14:09] after another all the automobiles go uh
[14:12] uh companies way back in debt a uh the
[14:16] the the ones Fanny May Freddy Mack
[14:19] falling apart there where where it looks
[14:21] like they can't even loan loan a loan
[14:23] anymore to anybody who wants to buy a
[14:25] house you stand back and you say well
[14:27] what is it we start to see the the
[14:28] message of this hour has explained to us
[14:31] the world is going to fall
[14:34] apart and then when when it comes down
[14:36] to the bride she's she she should be
[14:39] lifting up her head for her Redemption
[14:41] dri nigh when she looks at the word of
[14:44] God coming to pass when she looks at
[14:47] thus sayith the Lord right I don't know
[14:49] if uh if uh if anybody shared with you
[14:51] the Google c yeah anybody told you about
[14:54] it or showed you the the the clip on it
[14:57] right I was looking at that and I saw
[14:59] that car driving through the streets
[15:01] driving first of all on a course right
[15:03] and then eventually driving on the
[15:05] streets the man sitting at the wheel but
[15:07] not touching the wheel not touching the
[15:09] brakes not touching the gas and it
[15:11] performed better than most people can
[15:13] drive better than I can drive sometimes
[15:16] ask my wife now so so she's a good
[15:20] backseat driver don't get me
[15:23] wrong so here we go so we find out that
[15:26] look what is it brother Brown said we're
[15:29] waiting for the roads right you don't
[15:31] need the roads no more it wasn't it
[15:33] wasn't installed in some special car
[15:35] right it was adapted to a Toyota right
[15:37] yeah you know adapted to a Toyota that
[15:40] means it could probably be adapted to
[15:41] any car any car that gots a gasoline
[15:44] pedal and and a steering wheel it can be
[15:46] adapted to it exactly you know so so it
[15:49] doesn't take a work of science anymore
[15:51] it's on the it's on the it's not only on
[15:53] the map it's being used it's being
[15:56] tested and laws are being passed like
[15:59] they said that laws were being passed in
[16:01] uh in Nevada for it to get on the
[16:03] highway
[16:06] already it's safe enough to get on the
[16:08] highway and drive down the road and you
[16:11] being another driver driving alongside
[16:13] it wouldn't be afraid of that car yeah
[16:16] right cuz it's that close to being
[16:18] better than most most drivers that might
[16:20] be texting on their phone yeah you
[16:23] know better than that cuz you could be
[16:26] texting on your phone and it's taking
[16:28] it's taking you just perfectly down the
[16:29] street or sleeping in your car maybe
[16:33] taking you down the street fine so what
[16:35] is it and they're saying well no we're
[16:37] not wanting you to get off the the
[16:38] steering wheel we want you to still have
[16:40] control but in reality you can turn your
[16:44] back and play a game of cards or
[16:45] whatever brother Brown saw happening
[16:47] there on that car car of the future that
[16:50] that he saw so what are we looking at
[16:53] we're looking at thus sayth the Lord
[16:55] coming to pass and when we stand back
[16:58] see thus sayith the Lord coming to pass
[17:00] y you
[17:02] know if we went back down to Egypt all
[17:05] right let me go back in a little
[17:06] scenario if you were in Egypt and you
[17:09] were sitting
[17:10] there and you
[17:12] heard that the Brethren come up and say
[17:16] Moses said for us to do this put the
[17:18] blood on the on the doorpost Y and and
[17:21] and and and we're going out of Egypt
[17:23] this day we're we're going we're going
[17:25] to apply the token and get out of Egypt
[17:27] this day where is if you were an
[17:30] Israelite in that day in that age if you
[17:32] were just imagine yourself right in that
[17:34] place you'd stand back and say you know
[17:37] what I'm going to do what Moses said
[17:40] because I believe it's thus said the
[17:42] Lord but what's the real
[17:45] sign the real sign that they were seeing
[17:47] is God again manifesting himself in our
[17:52] time in our time exactly the coming of a
[17:56] prophet is a sign Y is a sign of the end
[18:02] time the revealing of the truths that
[18:05] were hidden throughout all ages that you
[18:07] take a look at the Seven Seals and you
[18:09] see clear as a bow what God had hidden
[18:13] Through the Ages and the and the
[18:14] reformers could were tapping that but
[18:17] never could get to the fullness of you
[18:19] come and you read your scripture and you
[18:21] see it to coming to pass you see the
[18:24] revelation of it it's the coming of God
[18:27] almighty
[18:28] y manifesting himself through a message
[18:32] of this hour sir that would bring a
[18:34] truth hidden Through the Ages to be
[18:37] revealed in your day and age you're
[18:39] taking part of the third pool right amen
[18:42] you see I'm taking part of the third
[18:44] pool I'm taking a part of the Crea word
[18:46] well the Crea word the whole third pool
[18:49] was showing
[18:50] us showing us it's the revealing of the
[18:54] word right it's the revealing of the
[18:57] word to bring bring you to an
[18:59] understanding right right to be a faith
[19:01] people who could stand up and say look
[19:04] no I don't care what's happening around
[19:07] me I don't care of my infirmities I
[19:10] don't care of my sicknesses I don't care
[19:13] I believe God's word above what I feel I
[19:16] believe God's word above what I see what
[19:19] I can taste what's going on around me
[19:22] little dream I had just night before
[19:24] last
[19:26] actually I was there you know the the
[19:29] fancy little Leatherman Tool the the the
[19:31] one called The Wave which gots a uh
[19:34] blades on the outside where you can just
[19:35] flick them out fairly easy well in the
[19:39] dream I was there trying to hide this
[19:40] thing some trying to hide it like under
[19:42] a in between a bed or in between the
[19:44] mattress and the and the boards that are
[19:46] under the bed or something like that I
[19:47] was trying to hide it and and so so I I
[19:52] come out and I says you know they're
[19:53] they're confiscating all metals they're
[19:56] confiscating all metals M so I step out
[20:00] and they're going to they're about to go
[20:01] into my bedroom to search for these for
[20:03] all metal I say so you know what I says
[20:07] here have my ring I was trying to hide
[20:10] it but I decided to give it to
[20:12] you how could a Lea me be worth more
[20:15] than my wedding ring you know right you
[20:17] know but you know what when pressure is
[20:21] on like that right a simple little
[20:24] multi-tool would be worth more than your
[20:27] more than your wedding ring right right
[20:29] gold doesn't mean nothing to you anymore
[20:32] right you know if if they're taking all
[20:34] metal you walk into your kitchen you say
[20:36] you know what you'd like to hide a knife
[20:39] yeah a kitchen knife you'd like to hide
[20:41] that let them take the silverware let
[20:43] them take all those things but a kitchen
[20:45] knife would be worth more than you more
[20:47] to you than your wedding ring or your
[20:49] gold that you might have and in the
[20:51] dream they're saying okay they had me
[20:54] sitting at a table there and they said
[20:55] we Gord and remove all the gold out of
[20:57] your mouth
[20:59] I says the gold out of my mouth yeah he
[21:01] says we're we're having to confiscate
[21:03] all the gold first we're going to take
[21:05] all medals we're taking the goal first

[23:57] days of of the voice of the seventh
[23:59] angel when he shall begin to sound Glory

[24:10] would have never gotten out in this form
[24:12] right you know right you know quickly
[24:16] they could they could silence this one
[24:17] right but they can't silence the days of
[24:21] the voice of the seven things right
[24:22] right amen and the Bible also says faith
[24:26] cometh by what by hearing hearing of the
[24:29] word of God glory amen so where are we

[24:34] double portion where we can receive what
[24:37] God has given us in the first and second
[24:39] and third pole amen what God has given
[24:42] us in the revealing of his word right
[24:45] amen and the truth that's been given us
[24:46] in the Seven Seals we recognize that
[24:49] that
[24:51] cloud excuse me somebody said they had
[24:54] water up here you asked and said you
[24:56] didn't I'm
[24:58] sorry I had coffee I had coffee back
[25:02] there but it's not helping me up here
[25:06] now I can't get warned by a painted fire
[25:09] I can't satisfy my thirst back there all
[25:12] right well you know when we recognize
[25:15] that this seven seal this this Cloud
[25:17] mystery has come to question and a lot
[25:19] of things that brother brandham did in
[25:21] this in his in in his ministry they'll
[25:24] come up and and and try to disprove it
[25:26] in this day and age but you know what
[25:29] there comes a place in your life where
[25:30] you can say that was settled for me
[25:32] right you know it's just the same as if
[25:35] you come back and somebody starts to ask
[25:36] you did you really accept Jesus Christ
[25:39] did you really accept what he did for
[25:41] you at Calvary you say that was settle
[25:44] for me right you can't come back and
[25:46] make me question that for nothing
[25:48] exactly I know that he paid the price
[25:51] for Daniel Martinez he died at the
[25:53] calvary for my sins and there's no way
[25:56] that you can pull my sins out of Jesus
[25:59] Christ's Heart Right amen and present
[26:02] him before the devil or or before the
[26:04] the the Judgment seat of Christ you
[26:06] can't pull them out of God's
[26:09] heart so just that you can have that
[26:12] confidence that you know beyond any
[26:14] Shadow of Doubt that your sins were
[26:16] buried in Calvary right and ra and and
[26:20] your life was raised in him come on just
[26:22] that you have that confidence is the
[26:25] same kind of confidence that you can
[26:27] come back and say look I don't care how
[26:29] they criticize the message of this hour
[26:31] I know it's a fact and I know it's true
[26:34] and I know it's thus say the Lord and
[26:36] you can't pull that away from me you
[26:38] can't take that word from me because I
[26:40] know beyond any Shadow of Doubt that
[26:42] that's thus sayith the Lord and it's
[26:44] going to be holding true thank you
[26:47] brother amen it's going to be holding
[26:48] true until eternity passes and it's thus
[26:52] sayith the Lord right so how can you
[26:55] take away the Holy Ghost excuse MH
[26:59] right how can you take away what the
[27:01] Holy Ghost has done in your day and age
[27:04] that's how you can say look I I I it's
[27:06] settled for me I know the cloud even
[27:09] though they might tell you about the
[27:11] timing and all these things I know that
[27:13] in a fact it was Christ himself coming
[27:17] down in a representation of that third
[27:20] pole that was going to reveal the truths
[27:23] of the Seven Seals amen amen right I
[27:27] know that that storm in Colorado went
[27:29] back on itself just the same as God our
[27:32] lord Jesus called a storm to peace right
[27:35] right am on that yes sir and that storm
[27:37] on on the on the sea testimony on the
[27:40] sea I know for a fact that just the same
[27:43] as Jesus Christ walked up and said out
[27:46] of five fishes and a few loaves I know
[27:49] that it's for a fact that if we come
[27:51] into that point where we need something
[27:55] from God he'll multiply out of nothing
[27:58] something you
[27:59] need am amen believe it how can you come
[28:03] to that place how can you come to that
[28:05] Faith because Abraham went up that
[28:08] mountain and he he was going up to
[28:10] sacrifice his own son right and when he
[28:12] was walking up that mountain he didn't
[28:14] know how he was going to do it he was
[28:17] ready and determined to accomplish what
[28:20] God told him to do and he was going to
[28:22] kill Isaac he was going to kill Isaac
[28:25] and and burn him right there on the
[28:28] sacrifice he stacked the wood he put it
[28:31] in place he took his knife he was going
[28:33] to kill Isaac amen right and he said and
[28:37] he was and he knew for a fact that God
[28:40] would raise him out of those
[28:42] actions right but God decided I wasn't
[28:45] going he wasn't going to go that far he
[28:47] didn't let him go that far but we
[28:49] recognize we
[28:51] recognize that just the same way you
[28:55] come to the place where you say look I
[28:58] I've laid it all down already right
[29:00] right you've come to the place where you
[29:02] say look I've I've anchored my soul
[29:05] right in a Haven of Rest there's nothing
[29:07] going to question my heart about the
[29:10] truths that God has revealed to me in
[29:12] this day and age through the message of
[29:14] this hour right amen right what is it
[29:18] what is it what brings you to this place
[29:20] where you can say without any Shadow of
[29:22] Doubt I can believe look at what was it
[29:25] the third pole the Third P the squirrels
[29:28] the storm in Colorado the the the the
[29:31] tumor and sister media what is it where
[29:34] can you come to a place where almighty
[29:37] God can show you every aspect of his
[29:39] creation yeah every aspect of his his
[29:42] ability to bring back right you to an
[29:46] original form right where he can where
[29:49] he can can create a squirrel where he
[29:51] can speak to the storms where else can
[29:54] you see the truth of what we're going to
[29:57] need
[29:58] right under
[29:59] pressure how do you how do you you know
[30:02] sometimes it looks like you know if if
[30:04] pressure comes on you which I I believe
[30:08] the bride is not brother Brown explained
[30:11] the bride's not here to go through what
[30:13] the first church AG went through the
[30:15] bride's not going to go through the
[30:17] Lion's dens right the bride's not going
[30:19] to go over there and be he said you know
[30:22] they they they've already made uh a uh
[30:25] what do they call it a concentration
[30:27] in in in
[30:28] Alaska you know and and and and and and
[30:32] I I don't know how far that's come but I
[30:35] do know this the bride won't be part of
[30:38] that you say she'll be because it's come
[30:42] to a place where it's
[30:44] time where the scripture says the bride
[30:47] has made herself ready she's come to a
[30:50] faith where she believes God she
[30:53] believes his word and the word brother
[30:55] said there won't be one of them bomb
[30:57] fall no right before the bride's gone on
[31:00] the Rapture exactly where are we looking
[31:03] at you say well Israel is about to get
[31:06] angry enough to send an atonic bomb he
[31:08] said they won fall right you know so we
[31:11] stand here and we stand here looking at
[31:13] at what God's done in his work and we
[31:17] stand here looking at what what's our
[31:19] part to play here amen right amen here
[31:22] Lula what's your part to play how do I
[31:24] do it how do I get to the place where
[31:27] I'm I'm I'm I'm beyond any Shadow of
[31:29] Doubt a man of Faith like Abraham where
[31:32] I can stand back back and say look I
[31:35] don't care what the symptoms are but I
[31:38] believe what God said about it I believe
[31:41] what the word is right I believe what
[31:43] god mentioned to me I can believe what
[31:45] God's spoken to me through thus sayith
[31:47] the Lord the spoken word in this hour
[31:49] right you come to the place where you
[31:51] say look I may not know what I got to
[31:54] say but I do know this
[31:57] I do know that I've come to the place
[32:00] where I was
[32:01] baptized and I'm and and I was baptized
[32:04] I died my old Nature's gone and I've
[32:07] come to the place where I'm going to be
[32:09] a
[32:10] possessor of God's Own spirit amen amen
[32:14] I am I I I know beyond any Shadow of
[32:17] Doubt that his own life the token life
[32:20] his own life has come down to live in my
[32:22] heart right amen and my malice my
[32:24] jealousy my my my contrariness my my my
[32:30] contrary nature it's dead and it's been
[32:33] buried in Christ and I'm going to stand
[32:36] in the fullness of life and if you want
[32:38] to look at Jesus Christ well shake my
[32:40] hand because you're going to see Jesus
[32:43] Christ in me you may see Daniel Martinez
[32:46] outwardly but Christ lives in my heart
[32:50] and that's what happens to every
[32:51] believer they come to the place where
[32:53] they don't it's no longer their own life
[32:57] they've died and Christ lives in them
[33:01] Christ manifests out of them that's how
[33:03] you can stand back and you can walk up
[33:05] look my sister was was was suffering
[33:08] with a little flutter in her
[33:10] heart and she says you know what uh uh
[33:13] she says I I I I don't know what to do
[33:16] I'm going to go to the doctor so she
[33:17] goes to the doctor and and the doctor
[33:20] says you know what doctor says it's
[33:22] going to happen to you one of two ways
[33:25] says one of two ways says yes he says
[33:27] it's either going to get worse or it's
[33:29] going to get
[33:32] better anybody would have figured that
[33:34] one out I could have told her
[33:37] that but and I'm not even the doctor but
[33:40] she she says well she walked her away
[33:42] kind of discouraged saying oh no so they
[33:44] said this could kill me this fluttering
[33:47] in my heart could kill me and she she
[33:49] walked away real sad and she's listening
[33:51] to to a minister her pastor
[33:54] preaching uh and her pastor says says
[33:57] you know he says you don't let that
[33:59] devil uh tell you how how how you know
[34:03] what what's on you right you believe
[34:05] what God said about it right so she
[34:08] started thinking and she said you know
[34:11] what there's nothing can pull me out of
[34:15] the place where I know Jesus died for
[34:17] Meen exactly nothing can move me from
[34:20] there amen and she says you know what
[34:24] that same price that he paid at Calvary
[34:27] for my sins to to to to save me right is
[34:33] the same price he paid to heal me all
[34:35] right so she said you know what she says
[34:38] I believe that by his stripes I'm Healed
[34:41] and that's what the word says about it I
[34:43] don't believe
[34:44] this and just then the little thing
[34:46] started again and oh my gosh she started
[34:49] getting weak and all this stuff she said
[34:51] what am I going to do
[34:52] now she says I don't believe it and she
[34:56] stood there and she says I don't believe
[34:58] it I believe God's word about it am and
[35:00] she kept saying I believe God's word
[35:02] about it amen she says it just it just
[35:05] like a poof started getting
[35:08] smaller it was
[35:12] gone I said how'd that happen how'd that

[35:18] same Faith Abraham did he says contrary
[35:21] to anything I believe what you say about

[35:26] it what your word says about it every
[35:29] promise in this word is yours right and
[35:32] if you believe God and you believe what
[35:34] his word says it's what he said about it
[35:37] that's the truth right amen so what
[35:41] happens you say well Satan still came
[35:44] back sure but you know what if you can
[35:47] believe that Calvary is real if you can
[35:50] believe he died for your sins you can

[44:11] bring ah but it's not by our record
[44:14] we're going
[44:15] by we're going by what was already paid
[44:18] at Calvary let his record show right
[44:21] that he paid the price for us right and
[44:23] we don't have to pay it because you know
[44:26] Satan you you tricked me into this right
[44:30] but my life in him you can't trick me
[44:33] into it again amen amen hallelujah you
[44:37] know we stand Justified not Justified on
[44:39] our own works but in his Works amen
[44:43] right we look at the truth of this day
[44:44] and age and we say look what a privilege
[44:49] what a privilege people we are right
[44:51] right how many
[44:53] thousands this whole world's falling
[44:55] apart how many millions of people are
[44:58] out there that can't see what you have
[45:00] seen right that's right that have not
[45:02] even heard of what you've
[45:04] heard seems like I was looking through
[45:10] uh history on
[45:13] Pentecost could you
[45:15] imagine they never even mentioned the
[45:19] prophet William brand how did he get
[45:23] these great campaigns that went out
[45:26] around the whole world seven times how
[45:28] did it get just swept under the
[45:31] rug it's not for the world it's not for
[45:35] the great big nerve centers it's not for
[45:37] the for the for the N it's for you the
[45:40] elected bride that was destined and I
[45:44] say
[45:45] destined if you really look at it it was
[45:49] a work of God that brought you to this
[45:53] place it's a work of God that actually
[45:56] turn you around to bring you here to
[45:59] hear the word of God for this
[46:02] hour because if I you know you could
[46:04] have just taken one more step and missed
[46:07] it
[46:07] totally one more step and you'd have
[46:10] never seen it but God was watching over
[46:13] you to make sure that you are destined
[46:16] to hear the word of God for your hour
[46:18] that's right amen hallelujah how many
[46:21] appreciate God how many appreciate what
[46:24] he's done in our day and AG
[46:26] amen but we look at it you say well you
[46:29] know what we shouldn't have elected on
[46:31] elected Obama because Obama believes
[46:33] that the gays should be getting married
[46:34] to each other you know and and they
[46:36] don't believe in the sanctity of
[46:38] marriage the scripture says that it's
[46:40] going to be like the days of we are in
[46:43] the days of Sodom it's got to go that
[46:46] way I don't care if Romney would have
[46:48] gotten in it was going to go that
[46:50] way because it's that time right but you
[46:55] know what it's also time for this bride
[46:58] to say look I want to
[47:01] fulfill just like the Google cars coming
[47:03] to come into effect I want to fulfill
[47:06] what God wants me to be in this word I
[47:09] want to be that Faith person I want to
[47:11] be that man that'll take God at his word
[47:13] and say look I don't care I believe what
[47:16] God said about it I believe there's a
[47:18] Rapture here I believe I'm a possessor
[47:20] of this Rapture I believe me and my
[47:22] household will be saved I believe God's
[47:25] word is true amen right amen I don't
[47:27] care what the what what what what's
[47:29] going on around me I don't care if the
[47:32] fire's falling already I stand believing
[47:35] God's word to say look the Holy Ghost
[47:38] said he'd keep me the Holy Ghost said
[47:41] he'd keep me in this time and he bring
[47:44] me to a rapturing faith right
[47:47] amen how is
[47:49] it because it's a happy time right you
[47:53] know it's a very solemn time y mhm you
[47:55] know what everybody that is entering
[47:59] into death doesn't go in there joking
[48:02] and having
[48:03] fun no no if I was on death row I'd be S
[48:08] sitting there saying oh Lord am I right
[48:10] am I ready say something I got to get
[48:12] right you know is there something if I'm
[48:14] sitting a death roll and the and the the
[48:16] guest Chambers waiting for me or The

[48:38] he's come and he's dwelling in us he's
[48:40] showing us these truths he's manifesting
[48:42] himself but you know what with judgment
[48:44] hanging over this whole world this world
[48:47] is falling apart brother Brown preached
[48:49] okay if this judgment hanging over us
[48:51] it's still a solemn time that we saying
[48:54] we got to go back to his word got to
[48:57] listen to those tapes got to see where

[50:00] that I work with that needs to know
