[1:53] on uh we had a wonderful time last night
[1:56] at least I did in the Bible study we had
[1:58] a lot of things and brother was there
[2:01] visited with us Wednesday and got a
[2:03] chance to talk with him good bit about
[2:05] the scriptures and things and hope that
[2:08] it helped him and it helped all of us to
[2:10] kind of back up and think on some things
[2:13] and we had a good time but we're still
[2:15] on the doctrines of the message and uh
[2:18] you know
[2:20] we I told them we would not put names on
[2:23] our two much but you know we might hold
[2:26] up a flash card to let the people that's
[2:28] there know who's preaching some
[2:30] doctrines when people ask cuz we try not
[2:33] to be it was not on the internet anyway
[2:35] unless brother Joe puts it there for you
[2:37] to put a tape off of it or anything like
[2:40] that so you know but we just have a good
[2:42] time sitting around discussing the word
[2:44] of the Lord and you know it's a good day

[3:09] sisters getting everything together I'm
[3:11] sure for for the food and the things and
[3:13] we certainly appreciate it and all like
[3:16] that brother Jonathan Jones which would
[3:19] be brother Jimmy Gibson's uh son-in-law
[3:22] will be preaching on Saturday night and
[3:25] Sunday morning for us and just pray that
[3:28] the Lord would bless him I know you
[3:29] already prayed for brother George Canada
[3:31] but keep him in your hearts he's the age

[3:36] in the nursing home so if you get a
[3:38] chance to go see him then go by and
[3:40] visit with him because it would help him
[3:42] all right now I ask you to uh please
[3:47] listen to this afternoon's message if
[3:50] you're not going to be here please
[3:52] listen because we're going to try to get
[3:54] on to the grace of marriage and divorce
[3:57] and if you're not going to be with us
[3:59] please please listen to the service that
[4:01] way uh you will know what we're trying
[4:03] to bring all right Matthew 19 3-9
[4:08] Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for
[4:09] your love and your grace unto us we
[4:11] thank you for the truly the grace that
[4:14] you've extended unto us that you would
[4:17] bring a people that is not worthy of
[4:19] anything whatsoever not even in the
[4:21] lineages or in the thoughts of mankind
[4:24] to think that we bunch of gentile people
[4:26] could ever even be saved but they they
[4:29] did couldn't read your thoughts Lord
[4:31] because we were in your thoughts and
[4:32] your minds before the world and we thank
[4:35] you that we're now making manifest upon
[4:37] Earth that mind that you had of us and
[4:40] just help us to be what you want us to
[4:42] be bless us now as we read the
[4:45] scriptures and as we talk about you we
[4:48] love you and we thank you and just have
[4:50] your way remember the sick among us you
[4:52] said it and we believe it you said you
[4:54] sent your word and healed us and
[4:56] delivered us from destruction and we
[4:58] thank you have your way now in Jesus
[5:00] name amen any other announcements that
[5:04] I'm most of the time I fail to remember
[5:08] everything but just doing that okay
[5:10] Matthew
[5:16] 19 now I ask you too if you will read
[5:19] the invisible Union or listen to the
[5:20] tape or whatever because you remember in
[5:23] The Invisible union he said this is just
[5:25] a higher order of marriage and divorce
[5:29] so I believe the only way we can
[5:31] understand truly the grace of God is to
[5:33] take it all the way through that's right
[5:35] and come out to the end with a correct
[5:37] understanding all right now the
[5:40] Pharisees came unto him tempting him and
[5:43] saying unto
[5:44] him is it lawful for a man to put away
[5:47] his wife for every
[5:49] cause and he answered and said unto them
[5:52] have you not read that he which made
[5:54] them at the beginning made them male and
[5:56] femal so would it be any way of doing
[6:00] those things all right and said for this
[6:02] cause shall a man leave father and
[6:05] mother and shall cleave to his wife and
[6:07] they twine shall be one flesh wherefore
[6:09] there are no more twine but one flesh so
[6:12] now how can you get all of this mess up
[6:14] into it what therefore God hath joined
[6:17] together let not man put
[6:19] aund they say unto him why did Moses
[6:22] then command to give a writing of
[6:24] divorcement and to put her away and he
[6:26] said unto them Moses because of the
[6:28] hardness of your heart suffered you to
[6:30] put away your wives but from the
[6:32] beginning it was not so and I say unto
[6:36] you whosoever shall put away his wife
[6:39] except it be for fornication and shall
[6:41] marry another committeth adultery and
[6:43] who so Marth her which is put away doth
[6:46] commit adultery you may be seated the
[6:48] Lord at his Blessing to the reading of
[6:51] the word now we've
[6:56] been trying to bring down the the the
[7:00] things and and speaking of uh the things
[7:03] and and showing you know uh what makes a
[7:06] marriage and what all of those things
[7:09] are to not condemn no one but to uh you
[7:15] know
[7:17] uh bring us to a place of understanding
[7:19] the
[7:20] scriptures all right see then the the
[7:23] prophet's message and the scriptures
[7:26] gives us a clear understanding of their
[7:29] lives and where we are and things like
[7:32] that and and this is not to condemn no
[7:35] one else we're all guilty that's right
[7:38] when we finish this up you may not be
[7:40] guilty of a natural adulterous act Etc
[7:43] or whatever you know but when we get
[7:46] into the invisible Union you'll find
[7:49] that we are all guilty of spiritual
[7:52] adultery
[7:54] because it's not many wives and things
[7:58] we have maybe maybe it would mess us up
[8:00] in the invisible Union is how many
[8:02] husbands that we have and you say but I
[8:05] only have one husband well we were
[8:09] married to organized
[8:11] religion that was our husband whether
[8:14] you like it or not that's the way the
[8:17] word is all right but just to you know
[8:20] to to get it plain all right but see we
[8:23] tried to cover this past Wednesday on
[8:26] the basis of of you know what would come
[8:29] stitute a
[8:31] marriage and you know trying to find out
[8:35] scripturally and from the prophet what
[8:38] makes it to be whether or not we would
[8:40] need a
[8:41] Grace or whether or not we don't need a
[8:44] Grace we went through some of the things
[8:46] on uh you know through the series we've
[8:49] been through some things that you know
[8:51] if a man's wife dies then he's free to
[8:54] marry but he must marry in the Lord he's
[8:58] not free to just just marry
[9:00] anybody he he has to marry a virgin you
[9:04] said well that's hard to keep the lineup
[9:06] on that well it wouldn't be if we line
[9:07] up the scriptures and understand a lot
[9:10] of things and and understand that a
[9:12] woman is a virgin when she marries and
[9:14] if her husband dies she's still a virgin
[9:17] that's that's scripturally and that's in
[9:19] God you don't understand that and if
[9:22] that husband dies and she marries again
[9:25] as long as it's in the Lord she's still
[9:27] a virgin that's because see it's it's
[9:31] getting it messed up with too many
[9:33] husbands Eve didn't have a problem in
[9:35] the garden with how many wives Eve had a
[9:37] trouble in the garden of how many
[9:38] husbands she had see and that was her
[9:41] trouble CU she had the Beast and she had
[9:43] Adam and that made a whole lot of
[9:46] situation all
[9:48] right but now going through the
[9:51] scriptures then to see that people would
[9:54] say you can go down to the courthouse I
[9:57] can prove by Courthouse I ain't never
[9:58] been married but one time well that's
[10:01] that's fine but that's carnal
[10:04] understanding too because we found out
[10:07] for you to be
[10:09] engaged you're married right all right
[10:15] and that's why we caution the
[10:17] children kids don't talk the boy ask you
[10:20] to marry him don't just joke Le oh yes I
[10:23] will be careful about those things don't
[10:26] get involved in it boys don't ask girl
[10:29] to marry you until you fully prayed and
[10:33] understand and and get everything right
[10:36] you know and all like that because you
[10:39] know I mean you're just a bunch of
[10:40] little old kids running around and you
[10:43] say well how old was you and your wife
[10:44] when you
[10:45] married I was 18 she was
[10:50] 16 bless you we've been together 55
[10:54] years so I think it's
[10:56] held you know it'll be what 55 this
[10:59] coming or 51 be 55 this coming August
[11:04] all right now we'll get into some things
[11:07] that are serious when we get down to the
[11:09] vows and the things that we're going to
[11:11] talk about a little more about the
[11:14] engagement but you know uh I'm just one
[11:18] that believes in oldfashioned
[11:20] Christianity amen you know I I believe
[11:24] that the Christian the new birth should
[11:26] have taken care of a lot of our problem
[11:29] problems yes of course we didn't have it
[11:33] we wasn't born with it we had to receive
[11:36] it and some of us didn't receive it
[11:37] until way on in life you know which
[11:40] meant we lived Our
[11:42] Lives you know and and all like that but
[11:46] yet uh still you know we have to come to
[11:49] a place of understanding amen but the
[11:51] Bible tells uh man and the woman both
[11:54] you remember I I brought that out see we
[11:56] think that the woman's got to be the
[11:58] Virgin but we don't think about the man
[11:59] being a virgin Paul speaks of The
[12:02] Virginity of a man as well as the
[12:03] virginity of a woman you need the
[12:06] scriptures we'll go into those things
[12:07] you know but I mean you ought to be able
[12:08] to read a
[12:10] little and and see we say well it's okay
[12:13] for him see we can read brother ROM said
[12:15] it's not said about him but it's said
[12:17] about her then you just place that on
[12:19] anything you want
[12:22] to see that's what they had done with
[12:24] the the grace of marriage and divorce
[12:27] that Moses had given the permissions and
[12:29] that but we went through
[12:31] that it wasn't just for burning the
[12:34] bread or you know you didn't like each
[12:36] others or whatever right CU we just read
[12:41] no man can put away his wife except it
[12:43] be for
[12:46] fornication now that we just read what
[12:48] Jesus said you're going to argue with
[12:49] him then go back to Deuteronomy 24 and
[12:52] see what Moses was talking
[12:55] about he was talking about a divorce
[12:57] situation
[13:00] all right see we've tried to make these
[13:03] things blunt and I'm sorry I am I'm
[13:06] sorry for being blunt and sometime using
[13:09] offline
[13:11] words to express my thoughts but at
[13:14] least you know what I'm saying and
[13:17] anybody else can look up words and find
[13:19] out what I'm talking about I'm not
[13:21] degrading people because the one you're
[13:24] looking at is degraded as well as
[13:26] anybody that's that I'm looking at or on
[13:29] or whatever they're seeing none of us
[13:31] have no
[13:33] rights whatsoever and when we get into
[13:36] invisible Union you'll find out more
[13:38] about
[13:40] that that we're all born in bad
[13:46] shape we're all born in sin shaped in
[13:49] iniquity spoused my mother's wound and
[13:50] went forth a liar that's putting about
[13:52] four scripture three or four together
[13:55] but it's true right nobody's looking
[13:58] down on no body else that's right but if
[14:01] you're looking down on somebody because
[14:02] you're goody goody just remember that's
[14:05] right you are the person that I'm
[14:08] hollering and screaming about to try to
[14:12] get you to see get away from that goody
[14:14] goody Holiness line you think you
[14:16] are I believe in true Holiness thank God
[14:19] for people that have kept themselves
[14:22] women men that have kept themselves but
[14:25] see that's the way the point you know
[14:27] most everybody thinks it's right for the
[14:29] the man he can go out just live do what
[14:31] he does he's boy you know
[14:34] he now give me the scripture for
[14:37] that the boy supposed to be a Christian
[14:40] as well as a girl supposed to be a
[14:41] Christian right amen as a matter of fact
[14:44] brother Brandon will blame him he
[14:47] said it's your fault
[14:52] boys it's your fault
[14:56] man all right we can get into a lot of
[14:59] things but forgive me for being blunt
[15:00] but at least there's one thing about it
[15:02] you can't say that you don't know what
[15:04] I'm talking about right right cuz that's
[15:07] that's the way it goes all right but see
[15:10] we found out that when you're are a
[15:13] spoused
[15:18] betral engaged word engaged is not used
[15:22] in the the New Testament or the oldest
[15:24] there's one time it's used in there
[15:26] speaking of an Engaged but the word word
[15:28] is espoused or
[15:31] betrothed but it's coming down to modern
[15:33] day terms we went through those things
[15:36] I've called
[15:37] engaged all right
[15:40] now see most people think a wedding is
[15:43] when a man and a woman goes up stands
[15:46] before the altar they go down they sign
[15:47] the paperwork that's part of it then
[15:49] they come up and they stand before the
[15:51] the the the uh the preacher you know and
[15:54] the preacher pronounces a man and wife
[15:56] and then they go home and live together
[15:58] you know in relationship they say that's
[16:00] a
[16:01] marriage well now according to the
[16:05] Bible of what we went
[16:08] through when God gave adam a
[16:13] woman he said it's Flesh of My Flesh and
[16:16] bone of my bones I gave you the quote
[16:17] where the brother Brandon was covering
[16:18] that that was when they were engaged you
[16:21] know that was that was him saying it
[16:23] about her but then God turns around and
[16:25] calls it his
[16:27] wife they're in
[16:30] Genesis
[16:32] right Joseph was a spouse to Mary
[16:35] engaged you know
[16:38] betrothed God said fear not to take unto
[16:40] thee Mary thy
[16:43] wife now you're going to argue with God
[16:45] about it or translations or whatever you
[16:47] want to with it go to any of them and
[16:48] look him
[16:49] up but the point is that I'm getting at
[16:52] see that when when you ask a girl to
[16:55] marry
[16:56] you and she accepts now if she don't
[16:59] accept that's not a wedding everybody
[17:02] clear we're not in the we're in a modern
[17:05] age today where the girls ask the boys
[17:07] to marry him but that's not in the form
[17:09] of scriptures or anything that's uh you
[17:12] know uh that's that's the problem of the
[17:15] age we're living but if a girl asks a
[17:17] boy to marry her and the boy says yes
[17:19] I'll marry you that's a
[17:22] wedding it don't give you a right to
[17:24] live
[17:26] together right see that's the supposed
[17:28] to be done later you're supposed to wait
[17:31] for those if you're going to try to be
[17:33] anything in Christianity if you're not
[17:35] going to be anything in Christianity eat
[17:36] drink and be merried cuz tomorrow you're
[17:38] going to burn up that's right forget it
[17:42] right that's where brother ROM I gave
[17:44] you the quote where we talking about
[17:45] polygamy he said the Christian World in
[17:47] other words tried to force poly Force
[17:49] the the thing to get away from those
[17:51] things and he said in those countries
[17:53] where there was polygamy there was a
[17:54] better
[17:56] world but he said polygamy is
[17:59] wrong he said don't you say that I
[18:02] believe in polygamy I
[18:04] don't all right now but getting down to
[18:09] it see I said some believe you're only
[18:11] married when you're consummated into
[18:15] that but now the
[18:19] engagement when the boy asks a girl or
[18:22] even here in the state of
[18:24] Georgia now according to the law if you
[18:27] live together overnight Etc whatever
[18:31] with the intent of ever marrying I think
[18:34] is the wordings of it you're counted
[18:36] common
[18:39] law even the law see that's what the
[18:42] prophet was saying we took the laws of
[18:45] Christianity and which is good he wasn't
[18:48] saying it was wrong but we forced that
[18:50] upon all of the world look at us today
[18:53] what are we doing we're going overseas
[18:54] to free those
[18:57] women
[18:58] and want to set them free what we do
[19:00] make prostitutes out of
[19:04] them we're really good at freeing people
[19:06] aren't we see we're trying to
[19:27] religionization
[19:29] that the Bible had already spoke of and
[19:31] called him husband and wife all
[19:35] right these are just quotes
[19:38] now from paragraph 86 of invisible Union
[19:43] 65125 brother BR says you're engaged to
[19:46] her as far as God is concerned you're
[19:48] married to
[19:51] her paragraph 193 questions and answers
[19:54] book
[19:55] 2648 23 the evening service your vow is
[20:00] sacred and that's what marries you he
[20:02] says no preacher can marry
[20:07] you he said it's your vows that marry
[20:10] you then you go to the preacher then you
[20:12] go to the thing paragraph 197 questions
[20:15] and answered book
[20:17] two he said even in the Old
[20:20] Testament now listen this is the one
[20:23] that I really you order to just read it
[20:24] over and over he said even in the Old
[20:27] Testament if you promis to marry a woman
[20:31] and you married
[20:36] another he said you was committing
[20:38] adultery and put out of the
[20:42] camp what do you mean b it was legal
[20:45] back
[20:46] there there that old Deacon said that
[20:48] time he called it
[20:50] polygamy trying to get you to life cuz
[20:53] everybody's so right now for some
[20:56] reason but I mean even in the Old
[20:59] Testament when polygamy was legal right
[21:01] do you understand what the situation
[21:03] would have to be then he would promise a
[21:05] girl to marry her if he didn't go
[21:07] through with that marriage before he
[21:09] went through with number 5 6 7 8 10 12
[21:11] or 14 he was living in adultery you had
[21:14] to keep his
[21:16] word You Remember by your words you'll
[21:18] be justified and by your words you'll be
[21:20] condemned the Bible said Every Idle Word
[21:22] Jesus said you'll have to give an
[21:24] account for that's right so where are we
[21:27] all right
[21:30] now the prophet paragraph 207 Daniel
[21:33] Daniel's 70th week the way they call it
[21:35] now uh 61 I think it's 806 he said
[21:39] polygamy is wrong we
[21:43] know then on e47 of the supernatural
[21:47] 56129 he says don't you say that I
[21:49] believe in polygamy I
[21:52] don't all
[21:53] right now then we're he's playing we're
[21:57] playing to understand what a vow
[22:00] is that's what we're going to talk about
[22:02] today a vow a
[22:04] vow we're going to cover the scriptures
[22:06] on a
[22:10] vow and remember my whole point is what
[22:13] if you're
[22:14] engaged as far as God is concerned
[22:17] you're married right Joseph and Mary
[22:21] were a
[22:23] spoused
[22:25] right but they wouldn't living together
[22:31] right because that goes into
[22:37] uncleanness you don't go that way well
[22:39] they're already married yeah you go over
[22:41] to some of these countries that some of
[22:43] these are from where that they don't
[22:44] have a preacher to get up and say The
[22:46] Vow they get together they talk it over
[22:49] the two families decide and the last
[22:51] thing you see is the husband and wife
[22:53] stepping over a stick into their little
[22:56] house but they're married
[22:59] married they're married they better not
[23:02] break that vow they do they're
[23:08] killed it's not just because we go down
[23:10] to some preacher or or go down and find
[23:12] out at the
[23:13] courthouse
[23:17] right so if you're engaged you're
[23:19] married we have to deal with those
[23:22] things then you go marry a boy after
[23:24] then what are you living in
[23:26] right all right but the boy see he's
[23:29] engaged he goes marryed a girl what's he
[23:31] living in that's where we want the
[23:33] woman's side she's the dog meat she's
[23:35] the byproduct she's the the thing that's
[23:37] not worth anything the Bible lays it
[23:39] down for both of
[23:42] us and doesn't make changes about but
[23:45] into certain Avenues between the man and
[23:47] the
[23:48] woman when the prophet said he can but
[23:50] she can't he can if he's got grounds too
[23:54] but if he ain't got scriptural grounds
[23:55] he can't divorce his wife and marry
[23:57] again
[23:58] that's right the prophet was even so
[24:00] specific he said you can put away your
[24:02] wife for cutting her
[24:04] high but he said but you can't marry
[24:07] again for that
[24:12] grounds so where are we at
[24:16] then and even if the Old Testament would
[24:19] hold it to be if a man promised a girl
[24:23] and then went off married somebody else
[24:24] before he come back married before he
[24:26] married that one he was living in
[24:27] adultery and the B and the prophet said
[24:29] put out the
[24:30] camp if that was true under that how
[24:32] much would it be true now when we're not
[24:34] living under the types and
[24:37] shadows we're in the what would be
[24:39] called the antip which means a
[24:42] fulfillment of the type amen we're not
[24:44] typing Christ in the church we are
[24:47] Christ in the church and a true husband
[24:50] and wife is a standing in a form showing
[24:52] of the same as Adam and Eve in the
[24:56] garden all right you said well none of
[24:59] us don't have no
[25:00] hopes all
[25:02] right we're going to get on down try to
[25:04] make it a little harder
[25:06] then see they try to take away some of
[25:08] these ideas we were talking with the
[25:10] brother last night that had come
[25:11] Wednesday night well see I told him I
[25:14] said you're sitting talking from your
[25:16] old thoughts of what organized religion
[25:19] has taught you we're talking about what
[25:22] the word says right you're saying you're
[25:25] quoting the
[25:26] word
[25:28] but we're taking the letter of the word
[25:30] that has been revealed to us to where we
[25:32] can see that he couldn't see that hell
[25:35] wouldn't
[25:36] Eternal you know I mean that was his
[25:39] point he couldn't see it you know what
[25:42] as a scripture opened up to me last
[25:43] night I'd never seen
[25:45] anywhere never thought about it
[25:47] connected to whether hell's Eternal or
[25:51] not and when I quoted it to the brother
[25:53] it just
[25:55] unfolded the Bible says death and in
[25:59] hell so now hell can't be Eternal
[26:02] because the scriptures we go through the
[26:04] you know the eternal life the thing but
[26:06] go back in the
[26:08] Scripture it says death and hell is cast
[26:11] into the Lake of Fire right which is the
[26:14] second
[26:19] death now death means
[26:23] annihilated death don't mean dying you
[26:25] know death means annihilation ated amen
[26:29] and that opened to me last night I said
[26:31] God I'm glad to be
[26:34] here with death and
[26:36] hell is cast into the Lake of Fire and
[26:39] then the second death is the death of
[26:42] the
[26:45] Soul see then that's the end of all
[26:48] things see the second
[26:51] death means you're dead it means it's
[26:54] annihilated then hell can't be Eternal
[26:56] cuz death and hell is is cast
[26:59] into the Lake of
[27:01] Fire see they're both annihilated all
[27:04] right this won't charge you for that I I
[27:07] like it when when I I see scriptures
[27:09] unfold you know 40 years studying on
[27:12] whether the hell's Eternal or not and
[27:14] Lord open a scripture up that we've read
[27:15] how many millions of times maybe in that
[27:17] period of time but he opens it up and
[27:19] then you see it okay all right now let's
[27:21] get into what we want to cover today and
[27:24] get started I want to go back over this
[27:27] one
[27:28] quotation from the from the prophet and
[27:31] then we will get into some scriptures so
[27:33] let's go to where the Prophet preached
[27:36] in 19 uh 65 63 12
[27:41] 13 we have seen his star in the east and
[27:44] have come to worship all right watch
[27:46] what he says paragraph 65 and 66 he's
[27:50] talking about Joseph and Mary and the
[27:53] spouse you know all right now I'd like
[27:56] to pass this on before we go further
[27:58] espousing in the old in the East was the
[28:01] same as marriage is
[28:04] betral and as soon as they as they were
[28:07] a spoused they were married when that
[28:09] sacred vow between them was taken what's
[28:13] Now read Deuteronomy we're going to read
[28:16] this 223 you'll find out that when this
[28:19] young woman and the man agreed to be
[28:22] married yet they did not take the vows
[28:25] for months later is that Joseph and Mary
[28:28] they were espoused but they take didn't
[28:30] take the vows and thing what and if they
[28:33] even broke that vow they were guilty of
[28:36] adultery that's right then they were ASP
[28:40] when they were espoused they were just
[28:42] the same as marriage the law had not
[28:45] given them rights to live together as
[28:48] husband and wife yet but before God when
[28:51] they promised one another their words
[28:54] they were sealed in God's kingdom and to
[28:57] to break that was just committing
[28:59] adultery and now Joseph was a spouse to
[29:03] Mary goes on to telling the men if you
[29:06] understand all right
[29:12] now look at Deuteronomy let's read
[29:17] that if I don't get into the grace of
[29:19] marriage and divorce this evening I'll
[29:20] do it Wednesday night don't matter to me
[29:23] I just preach till I get through and
[29:25] quit have you ever read
[29:28] Deuteronomy I'm sure you have but have
[29:30] you ever read it and looked at it the
[29:32] Bible is so
[29:34] beautiful it's perfect the way it
[29:38] states until you don't have no right to
[29:42] argue about good to see sister Carver
[29:43] back there with
[29:47] us watch
[29:49] now it says if a damel is a virgin that
[29:54] is a virgin be betroth unto a husband
[29:57] and a man find her in the city and lie
[30:00] with her now watch how specific the
[30:03] Bible
[30:05] is then then you shall bring them both
[30:09] out of the gate of that City and you
[30:11] shall Stone them with stones that they
[30:14] die the damel because she cried not see
[30:18] she's in a city she cries in a city she
[30:20] could be heard watch the other when
[30:22] she's out in the country can't be heard
[30:23] look how specific it is because she
[30:26] cried not being the city and the man
[30:28] because he hath humbled his neighbor's
[30:31] wife now she's just
[30:34] betr but the Bible says he's humble his
[30:37] neighbor's wife so Thou shalt put away
[30:39] evil from among it but if a man find a
[30:42] betro damel in the field see now this
[30:45] was in the
[30:46] city and she cried somebody would hear
[30:49] you in the city but watch The Script but
[30:52] if a man find a betro damel in the field
[30:55] and the Man force her in lie with her
[30:57] then the man only that lie with her
[30:59] shall
[31:01] die he said well what's that meaning
[31:04] he's in the city here in the country was
[31:06] in the city she could be heard
[31:09] crying right well we were in a modern
[31:12] day when they put H over the mouth don't
[31:14] be silly bite his
[31:17] finger
[31:21] scream take other
[31:24] measures I know I'm blunt just take
[31:26] other measures
[31:27] hit him where it hurts and he won't rape
[31:30] you you said do that away well why not
[31:32] I'm just
[31:34] playing look but the
[31:37] damel Thou shalt do nothing unto the
[31:41] damel there is in the damsel no sin
[31:44] worthy of
[31:46] death now it says far as when a man
[31:49] rises against his neighbor you know what
[31:50] that is when you go back over the other
[31:52] scripture if neighbors rise up and one
[31:54] kill the other one you could run over to
[31:56] the to the
[31:57] um Refuge City and they couldn't get you
[32:00] all right so there's nothing in the
[32:02] woman there is nothing in the zamel no
[32:05] sin worthy of death that's why I've
[32:07] always said a girl that is raped that's
[32:09] not a
[32:12] wedding no and she's still a
[32:17] virgin if she was truly raped now if she
[32:21] volunteered we're back up over here she
[32:23] didn't holler but if you're out in the
[32:25] country see under the dam there's
[32:27] nothing for he found for he found her in
[32:29] the field and the betro dsh cried and
[32:32] there was none to save
[32:34] her see cities you could cry somebody
[32:37] here out in a country nobody would hear
[32:39] it watch now look how close it
[32:43] is if a man find a damsel that is a
[32:46] virgin which is not betrothed she's not
[32:50] engaged and he lay hold on her and lie
[32:53] with her and they be found in other
[32:55] words they find it out
[32:58] then the man that lay with her shall
[33:00] give unto her the dam cel's father 50
[33:03] shickles of silver and she shall be his
[33:05] wife because he hath humbled her no
[33:10] husband inv
[33:12] look he may not put her away all of his
[33:15] days I've got the quote somewhere laying
[33:18] on the table at the house or something
[33:20] I'll be glad to find it brother brandham
[33:23] said no matter what she ever does
[33:27] he can't put her
[33:30] away no no she go out some no you going
[33:33] to argue with your prophet he said no
[33:36] matter what she ever done called he
[33:39] humbled
[33:44] her Bible strict Prophet
[33:47] strict truth is truth but do we want the
[33:51] truth or we want well I I believe what I
[33:54] believe well
[33:55] okay the Constitution gives you that
[33:58] right right not the Bible and not the
[34:01] prophet but the Constitution gives you
[34:03] that right but are we going to live by
[34:05] the Constitution or we going to live by
[34:07] God's word amen so let's talk about this
[34:09] vowing a
[34:12] vow let's see how serious it is to vow
[34:15] vow Every Idle Word the Bible said Jesus
[34:18] said Matthew there where he was speaking
[34:21] when he goes on down and says by your
[34:22] words to be justified and by your words
[34:24] to be condemned that's vers 36 and 37 in
[34:27] Matthew there I think it's what 23 or
[34:30] but
[34:31] anyhow but look at the next one look at
[34:33] number two what does it mean like to vow
[34:36] a
[34:38] vow he said evening messenger
[34:42] 63116 you go down to paragraph 307 and
[34:45] look what he
[34:46] says you want a closer walk with
[34:49] him come make a
[34:52] vow stand by him and keep
[34:55] it it won't do no good to make the vow
[34:59] unless you keep
[35:02] it
[35:04] right you can make your
[35:09] vow God has to feel it you just hold
[35:13] your vow right
[35:16] now we expect God to keep his word don't
[35:19] we right we ask him to keep his word you
[35:23] know what he asks us to keep our word
[35:25] you know what he expects us to keep our
[35:30] word we shouldn't
[35:33] blabber you
[35:36] know and mean the old saying this water
[35:38] bunks us old country folks boys used to
[35:40] be you know somebody runs up to you I'm
[35:42] going to bust your nose don't worry
[35:43] about him he ain't going to hit you cuz
[35:44] he hit you when he come
[35:46] running just bust his and forget it cuz
[35:50] he ain't going to hurt you cuz he
[35:51] running his
[35:55] mouth see somebody keep running their
[35:57] mouth just don't worry about the running
[35:58] their
[35:59] mouth they're not going to keep their
[36:02] word but we expect God to keep his word
[36:06] right was that Lord I took you at your
[36:08] word you said by your stripes I'm
[36:12] Healed now Lord is there something
[36:16] wrong well you know what he expects us
[36:19] to keep our
[36:20] word
[36:23] right when you became a
[36:25] Christian when you accepted Jesus Christ
[36:28] as your
[36:29] savior you vowed a
[36:32] vow why is it today even in the
[36:36] schools they try to give get the kids to
[36:39] take a vow of
[36:43] abstainers even in the
[36:48] schools that's all right I don't have no
[36:51] problems with it I just say it this way
[36:53] you mean you got to tell a Christian
[36:55] girl or Christian boy do not go out and
[36:57] live
[37:00] wrong you mean they got a vow to where
[37:02] they can vow to where they can keep
[37:04] their
[37:08] vow that's just getting your
[37:11] mentally working your mental
[37:14] abilities but there's no need of making
[37:16] a vow if you're not going to keep
[37:20] it he said honey I I vow to live true to
[37:23] you
[37:25] but I just think been able to well now
[37:28] your vow wasn't
[37:30] right in other words plain language you
[37:32] didn't mean
[37:35] it
[37:36] right you make a vow keep the
[37:43] vow because we ought to be Christians
[37:46] about it
[37:49] right see
[37:51] AOW to be it's a very important part of
[37:55] us
[37:58] there's no need of making that vow
[37:59] unless you are intended to keep
[38:04] it Dr old saying is talk is cheap except
[38:07] when you are a
[38:08] lawyer and it cost you but talk is
[38:13] cheap but it shouldn't
[38:17] be I told you we live in the day I'm old
[38:20] enough 73 I live in a time when my
[38:22] neighbor I've told you over and over
[38:24] about it had a store sitting there you
[38:25] could walk in store he was not even
[38:28] there most of the time you went in got
[38:30] what you wanted laid the money on the
[38:31] table and walked out if you didn't have
[38:34] the money to pay for it you R signed a
[38:36] piece of paper laid it on the table went
[38:38] on about your business you went back and
[38:39] paid him later when you had the
[38:41] money we didn't have no locks on our
[38:47] doors anybody coming down the road about
[38:50] 6 7:00 in the evening he would just
[38:53] asked to come in and spend the
[38:55] night you you fed him and give him a
[38:58] place to
[39:00] sleep of course I know we can't do that
[39:03] now we're living in a different world
[39:06] but I'm just saying what happened to
[39:12] it what happened to the being honesty
[39:14] and being right and being
[39:17] true and not lying I've heard some of
[39:20] you tell say well I was a professional
[39:22] liar I begin to believe my
[39:24] lies we was all born a liar I was a liar
[39:27] just like he was a
[39:29] liar but I didn't try to
[39:34] lie and I can stand here and honestly
[39:36] say I don't believe I ever tried to
[39:37] really lie out of
[39:40] anything when somebody asked me the
[39:42] school teacher asked me if I done it I
[39:43] told him I done
[39:45] it took the whiping and went on because
[39:48] I didn't believe in
[39:51] lying I believe anybody ought to keep
[39:53] your
[39:54] word if you're a liar you ought to
[39:56] repent for being a
[39:58] liar have you ever ask God to forgive
[40:00] you for being a liar CU if not you'll
[40:02] get in life today and you'll start
[40:08] lying well you ain't nobody around here
[40:10] can say I'm a
[40:11] liar that's one thing you won't
[40:14] say cuz I try my best to keep my word
[40:17] now if I promise you something and I
[40:20] can't keep it that's you call that well
[40:23] you
[40:24] know but I try my best
[40:27] to why because our word ought to be our
[40:29] Bond as a human being as a mortal being
[40:32] without one oun or Stat of Christianity
[40:37] right it order to be our
[40:40] bond
[40:42] right why because we're human
[40:45] beings but yet we just the way it is now
[40:48] you just
[40:50] anything anything you go
[40:54] yeah and see then you you wind up and
[40:57] you're
[40:58] engaged now I'm not going to ask you how
[41:00] many of you done
[41:02] this but I'll just make a
[41:08] statement when my wife and I you can say
[41:12] what he was 18 she was 16 we dated for a
[41:15] while when I was 16 she was
[41:18] 14 of course she wouldn't go with me
[41:21] nowhere but to the
[41:22] church or we had a double date with
[41:25] somebody else so we broke up and we
[41:28] didn't date for about a year something
[41:30] like that maybe a little less but then
[41:33] we got back together long whole story a
[41:36] lot of lives in it where she was dating
[41:38] my brother and you
[41:42] know one day I just run across her again
[41:45] we started
[41:46] dating but you know once we started
[41:48] talking of seriousness of ever
[41:51] being getting
[41:53] married or anything
[41:58] I never have asked her if she kept her
[42:00] word or didn't date nobody else because
[42:03] that's her
[42:04] business but over a year I never dated
[42:09] nobody for any reason now you understand
[42:12] my
[42:13] terminologies I never dated no one for
[42:15] over a
[42:17] year I had found the one I wanted to be
[42:20] my wife and I certainly didn't want to
[42:23] lose her by goofing up and dating the
[42:24] girls when even had opportunities and
[42:27] offers and things of even the girls and
[42:29] you know they had begin in that day to
[42:31] say I'll date you if so and so you know
[42:34] now they just come out and ask for
[42:35] everything else
[42:37] but I never dated nobody for over a
[42:43] year now is it something do you be
[42:48] engaged you know I mean you get
[42:53] engaged and what about it now boys and
[42:55] girls I mean how many of you kept it you
[42:57] got engaged I mean you really got
[42:59] engaged you really become engaged you
[43:02] know you wrote it out in the
[43:05] paper or become
[43:07] engaged and then you dated somebody else
[43:10] during that period of
[43:14] time I think you need an old fion
[43:17] repentance to your wife right
[43:19] now cuz you Dishonored
[43:22] her I don't care who you are we don't
[43:25] play games with the word of
[43:31] God if you were engaged and you wound up
[43:34] dating somebody else while you were
[43:37] engaged what kind of an engagement is
[43:39] that well we didn't know I know it I
[43:43] understand that we didn't know we didn't
[43:45] know that when we was engaged we were as
[43:47] married until we begin reading this
[43:49] message
[43:52] right we didn't understand an engagement
[43:55] was the same as was a wedding and if we
[43:57] broke that we were in adultery we didn't
[43:59] understand that till we heard this
[44:00] message
[44:02] sure but how many of you went out with
[44:04] other boys after you become engaged or
[44:07] other girls after you become
[44:13] engaged pretty serious ain't
[44:19] it and when you went out with other boys
[44:22] and other
[44:23] girls you know ever which way you go
[44:30] Bo and then you turned around and you
[44:32] kiss that boy or kiss that girl that you
[44:35] were dating while you were
[44:43] engaged see brother Dale when he talks
[44:45] he tries to talk straight that way I
[44:48] don't have to back up later and change
[44:50] things and 40 years ago I preached this
[44:53] and I was 43 years old and I mean 33
[44:57] years old and I preached it and I
[44:58] believed it then and I believe it
[45:01] now that's not bragging that I was I
[45:05] didn't date nobody for over a year and
[45:08] we wasn't even what you would call
[45:13] engaged we were just discussing
[45:15] marriages and
[45:18] that you know how many kids we're going
[45:21] to have that's nothing wrong with that
[45:22] you can talk to each other about where
[45:24] you're going to live and how many kids
[45:26] you're going to have and all like that's
[45:27] not
[45:28] weddings that's not
[45:31] engagements it's just finding out what's
[45:33] going to
[45:34] be all right but how many of you can say
[45:38] that I didn't date nobody else or I went
[45:41] out with some boy while I was engaged or
[45:42] I went out with some girl and I kissed
[45:44] on them or something you
[45:49] know
[45:52] well puts us in a horrible shape
[45:58] right why let's go to number three and
[46:00] see what the prophet had to say about
[46:02] Just a Kiss what do you mean brother
[46:04] Dale you I kiss boys I kiss
[46:08] girls so you know these quotes but let's
[46:11] read them
[46:13] again all
[46:15] right invisible Union of the bride of
[46:17] Christ 1965 11:25 paragraph 88 look on
[46:21] these screens and see those these movie
[46:23] stars kissing and hugging and slopping
[46:25] around
[46:26] over these women a woman that does that
[46:28] is of a bad
[46:31] character now he covers the woman but
[46:33] remember the man is involved right she
[46:37] don't kiss the back of her hand and call
[46:39] it her
[46:43] boyfriend she might be virtuous
[46:47] otherwise but you see in her heart when
[46:49] those glands sex glands are in the lips
[46:52] the man kisses a woman he's actually
[46:54] potentially committed a do ad
[46:57] Trey sex glands are in the woman's lips
[46:59] and in the man's lips he could kiss her
[47:01] on the hand it wouldn't mix through
[47:03] their sex gland But the Sex gland is in
[47:05] the
[47:07] lips so how many was engaged and went
[47:10] out and had another boyfriend or
[47:12] whatever or a
[47:14] girlfriend look what a situation it puts
[47:16] you
[47:20] in my wife can tell you in a hurry
[47:23] because I've told you about it many
[47:24] times we riding up the highway going to
[47:27] Lake Russell I
[47:30] believe and I told her I said I want to
[47:32] tell you my life I wasn't a Christian
[47:35] wasn't even a
[47:37] Baptist you know I didn't join the
[47:39] Baptist Church until after we were
[47:40] married but I said I want to tell you my
[47:44] life I said because I don't want no
[47:46] problems down the road I didn't know
[47:48] anything about the Bible and the
[47:49] prophet's message I was just a person
[47:51] that wanted to be honest I like to be
[47:54] honest and
[47:56] straight I've always told
[47:59] you how many of you want to make this
[48:01] statement I don't care for my wife
[48:03] knowing any thought I've ever had good
[48:05] or bad about
[48:08] her if she hears the finality of the
[48:13] thought I've had a lot of bad thoughts
[48:16] about a lot of
[48:17] you I won't mind you hearing them as
[48:21] long as you wait till the answer comes
[48:22] on the end of it cuz the answer comes on
[48:25] the end of it of me saying I love
[48:28] you you know brother Dale says that a
[48:30] lot
[48:32] right even converted churches to do that
[48:34] we went to one church and man they
[48:36] wouldn't even hug your neck and Bud way
[48:39] told me said Daddy don't tell them you
[48:41] love
[48:42] them not yet he said not yet you know
[48:46] what now they just hug each other and we
[48:48] just say I love
[48:51] you L people think boy he must be some
[48:53] kind of a yeah pervert he goes around
[48:57] tells you he loves you well I don't tell
[48:59] the women I love you now I do in my
[49:02] family but not to you women that's we
[49:05] love each other in the Lord but not
[49:07] right see okay bragging about yourself
[49:11] nope telling it like it
[49:13] is I tell it like it is I don't have to
[49:15] worry about it but the sex gland is in
[49:18] the lips and you go to
[49:20] kissing whether you're engaged or not
[49:23] all
[49:23] right now whether you're engaged or
[49:27] not and you go to kissing brother
[49:29] Brandon said we'll read it he said you
[49:31] ought not kiss that girl that woman
[49:33] until the day the veil is
[49:37] lifted sure we wouldn't talk these
[49:39] things where was anybody teaching
[49:40] anything like this back in organized
[49:44] religion don't talk about sex it's a bad
[49:47] word you don't even use that
[49:50] word right that's
[49:53] right like my wife always said about her
[49:55] mother if she'd have said sex in front
[49:57] of her mother she would have backhanded
[49:59] her in the mouth cuz that was
[50:02] taboo that's right
[50:04] see well now they're teaching sex in
[50:08] school if it was taught in the church
[50:10] and taught in the home it would have to
[50:11] be taught in
[50:13] school
[50:16] right the correct
[50:20] way but see what it would have been a
[50:23] potential adultery
[50:27] yeah so that puts us all in bad shape
[50:30] don't it that's
[50:38] right look what he says on the Oddball
[50:42] 1964
[50:44] 614 I'm sure going to have to read fter
[50:47] we ain't going to get on the grace this
[50:49] afternoon okay paragraph 50
[50:52] 51 it's almost a public adultery today
[50:55] right before for you I went to a certain
[50:56] place the other night to get something
[50:58] to eat and the little boys and girls up
[51:00] there hugging and kissing like I don't
[51:02] know
[51:03] what and do you know my little sister
[51:05] that that's potential an adultery when a
[51:08] man kisses you he has potentially
[51:10] committed adultery with you you should
[51:12] never let him kiss you until you're
[51:15] married why for the
[51:18] glands both male and female glands is in
[51:20] the
[51:21] lips do you understand and when male and
[51:24] female lands come together let it be
[51:27] where it may be you have potentially
[51:30] committed adultery and you shouldn't let
[51:32] a boy kiss you until that Veil is raised
[51:35] on your face and you're his wife don't
[51:38] do that it's committing adultery it's
[51:40] mixing male and female
[51:43] glands why don't a man kiss a man now
[51:46] we're in the
[51:48] perversion this was what
[51:53] 64 now
[51:56] had a picture in the paper the other day
[51:57] where one was kissing another one cuz
[51:59] they were okay in their same-sex
[52:01] marriages and
[52:06] things why don't a man kiss a man woman
[52:08] kiss a woman in the lips because it
[52:11] don't cross the
[52:13] glands children is born by Crossing
[52:19] glands
[52:22] right you know what Abby said here the
[52:24] other day
[52:26] she said Mama I figured this out 5 years
[52:30] old said you and Daddy got married said
[52:32] you kissed him he had a
[52:34] girl said that's me said I want y'all to
[52:37] get married again and him to kiss you
[52:40] cuz that'll bring a
[52:44] boy okay 5 years
[52:47] old don't you think they can't figure
[52:49] things
[52:50] out right that's right don't you think
[52:54] them kids there sitting over there they
[52:55] over there playing you know they're
[52:57] playing and they're really playing and
[52:59] oh they're not hearing a thing and you
[53:00] say that old preacher look what he done
[53:01] today he got the life and he cutting up
[53:03] and that kid sitting over there you know
[53:06] you hear every words you
[53:08] say you want Bible for it you remember
[53:11] in the Bible when the kids said about
[53:15] Elisha I said go up old bald head now
[53:19] where did they get that from Mama and
[53:22] Daddy sitting around the table saiding
[53:24] that baldheaded man thinks he knows
[53:28] everything and you know what happened
[53:30] don't
[53:30] you some sheers come out and killed 42
[53:33] of the kids whose fault was it mama and
[53:38] daddy
[53:40] right
[53:44] okay one more the presence of God
[53:47] unrecognized
[53:49] 1964 uh
[53:51] 618 paragraph
[53:53] 116 when no man should ever kiss a woman
[53:56] until he is married to her that's male
[53:59] and female glands Crossing now I don't
[54:02] want to emphasize that so much but I
[54:04] wish we
[54:08] could dogs don't
[54:12] kiss oh I've seen my little doggy yeah
[54:15] because you
[54:22] been horses don't kisss
[54:29] so now there would be a way that if you
[54:32] want to say that Adam and Eve was made
[54:35] in a way that would bring about a lot of
[54:39] things not in the way that God made him
[54:41] to do wrong it's the way he made
[54:49] them that's male and female glands
[54:51] Crossing let it be whatever it may be
[54:54] it's wrong is potentially a sex act when
[54:56] male and female Grands touch it's a sex
[54:59] act and it's m and a man kiss a man in
[55:01] the mouth it would make him sick make
[55:05] him vomit or woman a woman why is it
[55:09] different it is it's a sex act
[55:13] potentially that's right and watch what
[55:16] it is we don't want to get messed up we
[55:18] want to be right it's a type of Christ
[55:21] kissing his
[55:22] bride now he's not kissing his bride
[55:24] until he's married to her so when he
[55:26] says you ought to be married before you
[55:29] kiss and he's typing Christ in the
[55:32] church Christ ain't running around
[55:34] slopping and
[55:37] kissing
[55:39] right so it puts all of us in bad shape
[55:42] don't it
[55:44] amen and we all need the grace of
[55:47] marriage and
[55:49] divorce I know of very few people that
[55:51] have ever said they didn't kiss a girl
[55:53] or a girl kiss a a boy until they
[55:55] married a very few and that's honorable
[55:57] and very respectable and very
[56:00] cherished because it's sweet and great
[56:04] you held
[56:07] yourself but the rest of us can't say
[56:09] that
[56:11] right right so it puts us in bad shape
[56:15] but AOW a vow let's hurry up and read
[56:18] something go over to
[56:20] numbers 30 let's read a little bit in
[56:23] the scripture
[56:26] and it says this is the things that the
[56:28] Lord hath
[56:31] commanded now we're only going to cover
[56:34] down so part and then we'll stop and
[56:36] then we'll go back and cover because
[56:38] this is not all together just talking
[56:40] about
[56:42] engagements it's talking about any vow
[56:45] you make and I'll prove it with the
[56:47] scriptures of what it's talking about so
[56:50] where that you'll follow that and won't
[56:52] lock off on me and run in a different
[56:54] direction
[56:55] if a man vow vow unto the Lord or SAR an
[56:57] oath to bind his soul with a bond he
[57:00] shall not break his word he shall do
[57:02] according to all that proceedeth out of
[57:04] his
[57:05] mouth you remember we we have time we'll
[57:08] get to it in Deuteronomy I believe it is
[57:10] where that the man vowed to vow that
[57:12] whatever come out of his house if God
[57:14] would allow him to defeat his enemy
[57:16] whatever came out of his house he would
[57:18] offer as a
[57:21] sacrifice when he got home his daughter
[57:24] the only daughter he had walked
[57:26] out he kept his word and sacrificed her
[57:30] as a sacrifice she volunteer
[57:34] done and said father keep your
[57:39] V
[57:41] now I'm glad God don't ask us sometimes
[57:46] to do things that he's had people to do
[57:49] that's right I wouldn't want to
[57:52] sacrifice none of my kids to any to God
[57:55] or
[57:56] whatever but you know he put it in
[57:59] there and it
[58:02] happened to where we should realize how
[58:05] much it is to vow vow how sacred it is
[58:09] to vow vow all right he's to keep it if
[58:13] a woman also vow vow unto the Lord and
[58:16] bind herself by a bond being in her
[58:18] father's house in her
[58:21] youth little young
[58:23] girl and a father hear her vow and her
[58:27] bond wherewith she hath bound her soul
[58:30] and her father shall hold his peace at
[58:34] her then all her vows shall stand and
[58:38] every Bond where where she hath bound
[58:39] her soul shall
[58:41] stand says if he holds his
[58:44] Peace A lot of people uses this and you
[58:47] can use it it's
[58:49] fine but how do you use
[58:52] it they say I disallowed my daughter
[58:54] daughter's engagement to a
[58:58] boy how did you do it you didn't do it
[59:01] scripturally you just goofed up I proed
[59:03] down here in the Bible you're going to
[59:04] Bear her
[59:06] iniquity the Bible says
[59:09] it if you don't do it correctly and you
[59:11] do her wrong you bu you buar her
[59:13] iniquity the Bible
[59:18] says but see it can be used
[59:22] watch but if her father allow her in the
[59:26] day I've emphasized that and we'll prove
[59:30] the scripture says that in a second in
[59:33] the day that he
[59:37] heareth see what they do in the message
[59:39] now is they use that scripture and they
[59:41] say well well my daughter was engaged
[59:45] three times and I just allowed her every
[59:50] time I don't think that's right
[59:52] now are you sa my my daughter was
[59:55] engaged and we had the wedding planned
[59:57] and we made everything and we got
[59:58] everything ready and we put in the paper
[1:00:01] that was engaged but I decided to
[1:00:02] disallow it you're going to Bear her
[1:00:07] iniquity it says in the day now I want
[1:00:11] you to notice how many times it says day
[1:00:13] day day in other words the minute you
[1:00:15] hear it you separate
[1:00:17] that you don't wait 3 weeks and then
[1:00:19] decide to do it no is that the
[1:00:23] Bible back up read the other what was it
[1:00:26] and the father hear her vow and her vau
[1:00:30] where with sheath bound her soul and the
[1:00:32] father shall hold his
[1:00:35] peace he's got to say it in that day
[1:00:38] that he hears it but if he holds his
[1:00:41] peace then her vow shall
[1:00:44] stand and every Bond where with she hath
[1:00:46] bound her soul shall stand and we'll
[1:00:49] read down in a minute in about same
[1:00:50] scripture and he'll bear her
[1:00:53] iniquity
[1:00:56] okay just being plain no arguments no
[1:01:00] problems just being
[1:01:02] plain where we can see it but if the
[1:01:05] father disallow her in the day that he
[1:01:07] heareth not any of her vows or her bonds
[1:01:10] where with she ha bound her soul shall
[1:01:12] stand and the Lord shall forgive her
[1:01:15] because her father disallowed
[1:01:18] her now one of these days I'm going to
[1:01:20] get around and preach on
[1:01:23] Grace
[1:01:26] just a little bit before we get to this
[1:01:30] afternoon if your father
[1:01:32] don't
[1:01:36] disallow how are you going to get rid of
[1:01:41] anything
[1:01:43] right now that can be used about an
[1:01:49] engagement because it's talking about a
[1:01:51] vow that she makes when it says in her
[1:01:54] youth
[1:01:55] youth doesn't say a 40y old
[1:01:58] woman come on says in her
[1:02:03] youth you know what I'm talking about
[1:02:05] you know what the Bible's talking
[1:02:09] about little boys and girls now they
[1:02:11] just talk
[1:02:13] about when you grow up will you marry me
[1:02:15] well yeah I'll marry
[1:02:20] you and you know what they do a lot of
[1:02:22] times in in between there
[1:02:24] okay is that plain
[1:02:26] enough remember boys girls I'm not
[1:02:29] making a
[1:02:32] distinction boys guilty girls guilty no
[1:02:36] distinction it's not okay for him but
[1:02:39] wrong for
[1:02:40] her don't use the Bible wrong don't use
[1:02:43] the message wrong it's only okay for him
[1:02:46] if he's got grounds to make that
[1:02:49] okay that's where Jesus said he said
[1:02:51] because of the hardness of your heart
[1:02:55] in other words you were going to do it
[1:02:57] and you done
[1:02:59] it you wern't going to
[1:03:03] listen but
[1:03:05] listen showing you that this is not all
[1:03:07] just about getting engaged look what he
[1:03:10] said and if she had an had an all in
[1:03:13] husband when she vowed or uttered her
[1:03:16] oath out of her lips where she was bound
[1:03:18] her she bound her soul so you know hey
[1:03:22] if you're married you can't bind to
[1:03:23] marry somebody
[1:03:27] else right so it's not talking just
[1:03:31] about
[1:03:33] engagements is when you bind your soul
[1:03:36] with an oath in other words you give
[1:03:37] your word to do
[1:03:39] something you know kids go to churches
[1:03:43] and all like
[1:03:44] that and little bitty kid you know comes
[1:03:46] along
[1:03:47] and mama
[1:03:51] daddy they've been talking to us about
[1:03:53] being Miss
[1:03:56] missionaries and I want to be a
[1:03:58] missionary and I swore on an
[1:04:02] oath that I'd be a
[1:04:07] missionary you ought to get the kid and
[1:04:09] go down to the church and say hey quit
[1:04:11] trying to make these kids Swire these
[1:04:15] things cuz Bible says if you Swire you
[1:04:17] keep
[1:04:22] it you going to church where
[1:04:25] that they believe in giving the preacher
[1:04:27] all the money I'm just giving
[1:04:29] illustrations all right are you
[1:04:32] listening you go in a church where that
[1:04:34] they they pie The Collection plate and
[1:04:36] then they beat you to death because you
[1:04:38] didn't give so much then they pie it
[1:04:40] again they finally get you to vow how
[1:04:44] many of you was in organized religion we
[1:04:45] won't ask that question okay how many of
[1:04:47] you signed a pledge to pay you
[1:04:52] tithe come on am I right that's right
[1:04:55] the church wanted you to sign a pledge
[1:04:57] to give
[1:04:59] money if everybody give their tithe you
[1:05:02] didn't have to worry about the pledge we
[1:05:04] were talking about it last night sister
[1:05:06] trud I sat in the Deacon board and told
[1:05:09] that Deacon board I count the money that
[1:05:13] comes in
[1:05:14] upstairs cuz that's what I done that was
[1:05:16] my job to take it up and count it and
[1:05:18] give it to the treasur you
[1:05:20] know and I said there's more tithe due
[1:05:23] out of this Deacon board
[1:05:25] then it's coming in upstairs through the
[1:05:27] offering plate so you know I didn't play
[1:05:31] then and I was 23 years
[1:05:35] old this wasn't something I Was 80 years
[1:05:38] old we paid our tithe once we started
[1:05:41] and got to the place that we knew what
[1:05:43] it was we paid our tithe it come first
[1:05:50] absolutely but I can't afford to pay it
[1:05:52] you can't afford not to that's right
[1:05:55] amen that's right I don't care if you
[1:05:56] got to go borrow the money you can't
[1:05:58] afford not to pay you TI cuz you don't
[1:06:00] have no promise from God of a blessing
[1:06:03] you're robbing yourself go ahead amen
[1:06:05] right why are people in such Financial
[1:06:07] shape right that's right it's like I've
[1:06:10] told you and I mean it from the bottom
[1:06:13] of my heart if you want an oath on it
[1:06:15] I've said this many many many times here
[1:06:17] you pay tide one year sincerely out of
[1:06:19] your heart to honestly to God and you
[1:06:21] pay tith one year to this church not to
[1:06:24] me to this church and it comes in and we
[1:06:27] use that for God's honor and Glory at
[1:06:29] the end of the year if you're not better
[1:06:31] off I'll give you ever dime you paid
[1:06:33] that year back to you amen I've made
[1:06:36] that challenge that's as much sincerity
[1:06:38] as I think anybody could be then I'll
[1:06:41] give it back to
[1:06:44] you
[1:06:47] but you made a vow when you become a
[1:06:51] Christian that's right you made a vow
[1:06:54] that you would pay your tithe that's
[1:06:56] right you made a vow you'd live for the
[1:06:57] Lord that's what I'm talking about this
[1:06:59] is not talking about engagements right
[1:07:02] it's just vowing a
[1:07:06] vow you made a vow to be true to your
[1:07:09] husband to be true to your
[1:07:12] wife not going out slopping and kissing
[1:07:14] and doing all of those
[1:07:20] things you remember when Pat Boon
[1:07:22] wouldn't kiss a girl on the movie
[1:07:26] screen some of you ain't old enough
[1:07:28] maybe to remember those old days he
[1:07:29] wouldn't do
[1:07:31] it he was a
[1:07:37] Pentecostal but what's today now I'm not
[1:07:40] talking about him cuz that's none of my
[1:07:42] business what's
[1:07:47] today slopping and kissing
[1:07:51] around we'll get down to that a little
[1:07:53] later on when the prophet is talking
[1:07:56] about how that she can be justified be
[1:07:59] forgiven but never be
[1:08:01] justified that's an invisible
[1:08:06] Union okay let's hurry so it's not just
[1:08:10] talking about an engagement form it's
[1:08:12] talking about any vow that you make of
[1:08:14] proven it by her saying surely you
[1:08:16] wouldn't stand by and your wife say I'm
[1:08:18] going to vow be engaged to that guy I'm
[1:08:20] going to marry that guy over there now
[1:08:21] that's kind
[1:08:22] of uh off in the
[1:08:25] head right see that that's not just
[1:08:28] vowing the the marital part all right it
[1:08:32] can be used as that because she's a
[1:08:34] youth she's a young girl but if she's
[1:08:36] got a husband now watch if she's got a
[1:08:40] husband God deals with her
[1:08:42] differently okay if she had it all in
[1:08:46] husband when she vowed and uttered out
[1:08:49] out of her lips where where she bound
[1:08:51] her soul just like say I'm going to be a
[1:08:52] missionary no husband said I don't want
[1:08:54] you to be a
[1:08:55] missionary guess what I'm LED of the
[1:08:57] Lord I want to be a missionary I want to
[1:09:00] be a
[1:09:04] preacher but honey the Bible don't want
[1:09:07] you to be a
[1:09:10] preacher you be a missionary but how
[1:09:13] about being a missionary here at home
[1:09:19] first
[1:09:21] okay and her husband heard it
[1:09:24] now what she makes a vow a woman is
[1:09:28] married makes a vow and her husband
[1:09:29] hears it and held his peace in the day
[1:09:32] that he heard
[1:09:33] it then her vow shall stand and her
[1:09:36] bonds where with she bound her soul
[1:09:38] shall stand so if you girls go out and
[1:09:40] you or you women you go out and you
[1:09:43] say God leading me to get me a job and
[1:09:46] go to
[1:09:47] work and give all of my money to the
[1:09:52] missionaries i' say
[1:09:57] honey I don't think that's right oh I'm
[1:10:01] L of the
[1:10:02] Lord yeah but honey you realize what
[1:10:06] you're saying cuz if I don't say it in
[1:10:09] that day then her bond will SK and you
[1:10:12] know what she'll have to get a job and
[1:10:15] she'll have to pay it all to the
[1:10:18] missionary so you understand the husband
[1:10:21] has the right to say no that's right all
[1:10:24] right but if the husband disallowed her
[1:10:28] on that day and that he heard it not 20
[1:10:31] years later or something then he shall
[1:10:33] make her vow which she vowed and that
[1:10:35] which she uttered with her lips where
[1:10:37] with she bound her soul of none
[1:10:41] effect and the Lord shall forgive her
[1:10:44] amen now if you don't see marriage and
[1:10:48] divorce and the grace of God that I'm
[1:10:49] reading here then you might as well go
[1:10:51] home this afternoon and forget it and
[1:10:53] don't watch it amen or don't ever view
[1:10:55] it because you're not going to get it
[1:10:57] right amen these are only what was it
[1:11:00] Tom used to tell
[1:11:02] Johny yeah but what was he used to say
[1:11:05] he said in the morning he preaches this
[1:11:06] way in the
[1:11:07] afternoon he gets with
[1:11:09] it right but watch
[1:11:13] now but every Widow valow a widow look
[1:11:17] how specific the church is Father Can
[1:11:20] disallow the daughter's vow husband can
[1:11:22] disallow the wife
[1:11:24] vow but ever vow of a widow and her that
[1:11:28] is
[1:11:29] divorced wherewith they have bound their
[1:11:31] souls shall stand against them why they
[1:11:35] don't have no head to take it
[1:11:37] away right they don't have a husband
[1:11:39] father Etc to be able to fall back on to
[1:11:42] take it away their headships gone cuz
[1:11:44] they're they're a widow are
[1:11:48] divorced now watch just repeating itself
[1:11:52] but making it comes to a very clear
[1:11:54] point but she vowed in her husband's
[1:11:56] house now not talking about the Widow
[1:11:58] this is a woman now that's
[1:12:01] married separate this verse from this
[1:12:04] cuz it's not and as she vowed in her
[1:12:06] husband's house or bound her soul by a
[1:12:08] bond with an oath and her husband heard
[1:12:10] it and held his peace at her he held his
[1:12:13] peace and disallowed her not in other
[1:12:15] words he didn't stop her vow then all
[1:12:17] her vows shall stand and every Bond
[1:12:19] wherewith she bound her soul shall stand
[1:12:21] you say why is it repeating itself to
[1:12:23] where the rest of it will come into VI
[1:12:25] but if her husband ha utterly made them
[1:12:28] void on the day he heard them not 20
[1:12:32] years
[1:12:33] later then whatsoever proceedeth out of
[1:12:37] her lips concerning her vows are
[1:12:40] concerning the bond and her soul shall
[1:12:42] not stand her husband hath made them
[1:12:44] void and the Lord shall forgive her amen
[1:12:48] okay amen ever
[1:12:51] vow and ever binding oath to afflict the
[1:12:54] soul her husband May establish it or her
[1:12:58] husband may make it void amen there's
[1:13:01] your grace of marriage and divorce we
[1:13:03] get to this
[1:13:04] evening not turn that scripture if you
[1:13:06] don't see it you you're just missing
[1:13:09] it but watch but if her husband
[1:13:11] altogether hold his peace at her from
[1:13:14] the day to day in other words if he
[1:13:15] lingers it
[1:13:16] on like I said the girls have been the
[1:13:19] the the engagement party made and the
[1:13:22] boy and the girls engaged and done put
[1:13:23] it in the newspaper and then the daddy
[1:13:25] says I don't want her to marry him I'll
[1:13:28] just disallow
[1:13:30] that that can't be done because he's let
[1:13:32] it pass from day to day but the first
[1:13:35] day he hears it he says
[1:13:38] no brother brandom about Billy Paul
[1:13:40] what'd he do he said me and her daddy
[1:13:44] got together and aned a wedding but said
[1:13:47] Billy was
[1:13:48] married that's
[1:13:51] right y
[1:13:55] what but if her husband all together
[1:13:57] hold his peace at her from day to day
[1:13:58] then he establishes all her vows or all
[1:14:01] her bonds which are upon her he confir
[1:14:04] them because he held his peace at her in
[1:14:06] the day that he heard
[1:14:08] them now but if he
[1:14:11] shall if he shall any ways make them
[1:14:14] void after that he hath heard
[1:14:18] them
[1:14:19] now then he shall bear her
[1:14:22] iniquity now are you
[1:14:25] listening if he goes day to day if he
[1:14:28] lets it
[1:14:29] pass you know he learns of the vow and
[1:14:33] he makes it lets it pass whether it be
[1:14:35] an engagement whether it be a promise of
[1:14:37] somebody to be a missionary whether it
[1:14:38] be your vowed to give all the money you
[1:14:40] ever make to the Lord or you know there
[1:14:43] all kind of vows all kind of vows and
[1:14:48] vows all right but if he lets that go
[1:14:52] for a while
[1:14:55] then he comes up and decides to do it
[1:14:57] look what he does if he lets it Go day
[1:15:00] by day he lets it go and he doesn't stop
[1:15:03] her the day that he heard
[1:15:07] them but if he shall in any wise make
[1:15:09] them void after that he hath heard them
[1:15:16] right both of them's in
[1:15:19] trouble then he shall bear her iniquity
[1:15:26] MH all right are you following it these
[1:15:29] are the statutes which the Lord
[1:15:30] commanded Moses between a man and his
[1:15:32] wife between the father and his daughter
[1:15:34] being yet in her youth in her father's
[1:15:37] house plain enough isn't it if you vow a
[1:15:41] vow you got to keep the
[1:15:46] vow but your father if your youth in the
[1:15:49] house he can anull that vow and make it
[1:15:52] of none of for the day he hears it not 3
[1:15:55] months later not 6 months later not two
[1:15:58] engagements on down the road he done
[1:16:00] away with number one where number two
[1:16:02] would be
[1:16:03] okay you say that's done forget
[1:16:09] it but ain't none of our business who
[1:16:12] does what it's what we
[1:16:14] do just getting the scriptures and
[1:16:16] laying them out but if he just turns
[1:16:18] around
[1:16:19] and and he just lets it go and then one
[1:16:22] of these days he Ides well I don't think
[1:16:24] that's right my wife vowed to give all
[1:16:27] get her a job and give all her money to
[1:16:29] to the
[1:16:30] Lord I don't think that's
[1:16:36] right see if he's done it and let it go
[1:16:38] for a while cuz he wanted the money to
[1:16:40] come
[1:16:42] in but then when he found out she was
[1:16:44] going to give it all
[1:16:47] away then he decides not to do
[1:16:50] it he can't stop her and he bues her
[1:16:55] iniquity if he's a man of decent sense
[1:16:58] then he'd help her pay what she
[1:17:01] vied
[1:17:02] right I said a man of decent sense not
[1:17:06] even
[1:17:08] Christianity you see how serious it is
[1:17:10] to V
[1:17:12] vial you see how serious it is to say
[1:17:14] you'll do
[1:17:17] something do you know that if one of our
[1:17:20] ambassadors from the United States goes
[1:17:22] over this happened back when I was in
[1:17:24] school they went to Russia when they
[1:17:26] were needing food and things back in the
[1:17:28] probably in the late 50s somewhere right
[1:17:32] in there and our ambassador vowed to
[1:17:34] give Russia a bunch of wheat you know we
[1:17:36] had to keep our
[1:17:39] word if our ambassador goes he's an
[1:17:42] ambassador to represent us if he goes
[1:17:44] over there to a country and he vows to
[1:17:46] give them millions of dollars we got to
[1:17:48] do it cuz he's our spokesman he's the
[1:17:52] person chose Chen to to do
[1:17:56] that don't vow to vow if you're not
[1:17:58] going to keep it did we read that for
[1:18:01] the prophet just don't vow
[1:18:04] it you know the Bible says don't say
[1:18:06] I'll be at your house
[1:18:09] tomorrow Bible don't say that it says
[1:18:12] for you not to say
[1:18:13] that what do you mean I'm coming to your
[1:18:15] house it says the Lord
[1:18:18] willing
[1:18:21] right see that means can go take place
[1:18:24] that you don't know about then you're
[1:18:25] not a liar
[1:18:27] that's of course if you call my house
[1:18:30] and tell me you're coming I've always
[1:18:32] told you please call me up and tell me
[1:18:33] you ain't
[1:18:35] coming because me and my wife had done
[1:18:37] clean the
[1:18:38] house change the
[1:18:40] beds and got ready for you to
[1:18:44] come so you could at least call and say
[1:18:46] I'm not coming right am cuz I just
[1:18:50] believe in being straight and
[1:18:51] honest
[1:18:55] you know Christianity didn't make me an
[1:18:57] honest
[1:18:59] person that's what we
[1:19:01] think Christianity didn't make me not
[1:19:05] lie and cheat and
[1:19:10] steal you know I said that and I said
[1:19:12] well I never never stole anything no
[1:19:14] bigger than
[1:19:17] watermelon but see that wasn't stealing
[1:19:19] right because the man knew was walking
[1:19:21] right behind his house go get the
[1:19:25] watermelon it wouldn't stealing he knew
[1:19:27] we was getting them he told us to go get
[1:19:29] what we needed long we didn't bust Us in
[1:19:32] the
[1:19:33] patch I didn't go steal
[1:19:36] nothing CU I never did believe in
[1:19:38] stealing as a
[1:19:40] sinner I used to come out of General
[1:19:42] Motors cuz I had a job that involved a
[1:19:45] lot of come on mus this that involved
[1:19:47] traveling I could leave outside the
[1:19:48] plant and go over into what was called a
[1:19:50] complete the shipping I could go over
[1:19:52] our and I had the okay from the
[1:19:54] supervision I could just go drive out
[1:19:56] there and take their own buggies and go
[1:19:57] work on cars and do things and I had a
[1:20:00] lot of times I had Carter keys in my
[1:20:02] pockets I had nuts and bolts wrenches in
[1:20:04] my pocket I would go out the door going
[1:20:08] home you
[1:20:11] know and I'd forget about
[1:20:15] it well that's put them over over there
[1:20:18] you you didn't steal them I took them
[1:20:20] back in the next day and I put them back
[1:20:22] where I got him
[1:20:31] from you think people don't
[1:20:34] steal the old days we used to have cover
[1:20:36] alls very rarely they get a brand new
[1:20:39] power cover
[1:20:40] HS and they'd we them out the gate to go
[1:20:43] eat dinner and they wouldn't come in
[1:20:45] back into that gate cuz the guard might
[1:20:46] catch them they go over to the other
[1:20:48] gate and they come back in without the
[1:20:49] cover alls
[1:20:51] on seen people steal take a chance
[1:20:54] you're losing a job stealing spark plugs
[1:20:57] out of a car a
[1:21:00] motor but you could lose a real
[1:21:02] wonderful job over some little stupid
[1:21:05] silly thing that you'd
[1:21:09] steal I'd take it back in put it
[1:21:14] back why because I didn't want
[1:21:20] it If we're honest to that one can't we
[1:21:23] be honest with
[1:21:24] God he expects us to keep his our word
[1:21:27] cuz he keeps his
[1:21:29] word you vow vow unto the Lord remember
[1:21:31] to keep the vow
[1:21:35] amen but don't make a dumb
[1:21:40] vow that's what I said when you got to
[1:21:43] tell children and get them to vow to try
[1:21:47] to
[1:21:49] remain what is the word f celebrate is
[1:21:51] that the word how you pronounce that
[1:21:53] word in other words remain not active
[1:21:56] with boys and girls you mean you got to
[1:21:58] make people violent you got to make
[1:21:59] Christians do
[1:22:03] that but I will end it with one
[1:22:06] thing when you the day you took a vow
[1:22:09] either whether it was in front of a
[1:22:10] judge or whether it was what you take
[1:22:13] this woman to be your lawfully weighted
[1:22:14] wife take this man to be your lawfully
[1:22:16] husband said you say
[1:22:19] yes the Bible says until death do you
[1:22:23] part is what it ought to be said the
[1:22:25] prophet said that was what took out of
[1:22:26] it anyway may not be the wording you
[1:22:30] know but then we go out and slopping
[1:22:32] around and kissing
[1:22:34] around dating and
[1:22:41] things how can we ever expect God to
[1:22:45] save
[1:22:51] us what about it let's understand vow a
[1:22:59] vow a kiss is a potential
[1:23:09] adultery what about it how can we expect
[1:23:12] God to bring us Grace if we can't keep
[1:23:16] his word
[1:23:17] straight now we'll try to get to it this
[1:23:20] afternoon if we have time brother randam
[1:23:22] he's said I had the scriptures on
[1:23:24] marriage and
[1:23:28] divorce but he didn't have the grace
[1:23:32] that was given he knew that there was a
[1:23:35] possibility because he'll say it he'll
[1:23:36] say remain as you are because things
[1:23:38] have been done before you know but he
[1:23:43] couldn't come out there and say what he
[1:23:45] said on the grace of marriage and
[1:23:47] divorce even just because he knew the
[1:23:51] scriptures he said I had the scriptures

[1:24:27] grace he

[1:24:34] sermons trying to get everything laid in
