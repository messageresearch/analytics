[0:00] words of life that you would uh impart
[0:02] that life to us and that you would
[0:03] impart all that um it is set out to be
[0:07] uh to accomplish. Lord God, we're
[0:08] thankful for your precious vindicated
[0:11] word, for your precious vindicated
[0:13] prophecy for this last age. We're
[0:15] thankful for rapturing faith. We're
[0:17] thankful, Lord God, for all the seals
[0:18] that have been opened. And we're
[0:20] thankful, Lord, that you're giving us
[0:21] your Bible truth revelation. In the name
[0:24] of Jesus Christ, bless his teaching,
[0:25] Lord God, for your honor and for your
[0:27] glory, we say. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[0:31] So, id like to take a text for the study
[0:34] here where it says we he will joy over
[0:37] thee. And then it says with singing. So,
[0:40] let's go to Zephaniah 3:17.
[0:43] And here's a thought for the morning. It
[0:46] says, "The Lord thy God in the midst of
[0:50] thee is mighty.
[0:54] He will save.
[0:56] He will rejoice over thee with joy.
[0:59] He will rest in his love.
[1:03] He will joy over thee
[1:07] with singing.
[1:09] That's a thought.
[1:11] God will serenate over you. God will
[1:13] sing.
[1:15] And and the the the two words you want
[1:17] to keep in mind today is joy and singing
[1:19] or rejoice. The word rejoice and joy,
[1:21] very, you know, similar words. And the
[1:24] thought here is we sing unto the Lord,
[1:27] right? But what a thought to know is
[1:29] that he will joy over thee with singing.
[1:33] Amen. A God that receives worship that
[1:37] there is worship in his presence.
[1:40] Sometimes we kind of see him as a
[1:41] machine or something that's just,
[1:44] you know, that that that basically
[1:46] doesn't enter in. And it's something to
[1:48] look at today when we find about joy and
[1:50] how joy produces uh singing. Amen.
[1:54] &gt;&gt; So we find that in the book of uh
[1:56] Zephaniah
[1:58] obviously it's a prophetic book. It's a
[1:59] text that was during uh written during
[2:01] um the reign of King Josiah. So his name
[2:05] means Yahweh or the Lord Jehovah has
[2:09] hidden or the Lord protects. And it is
[2:12] believed that he prophesied around the
[2:14] ages of 6:30 to 625 for about 5 years
[2:18] before Christ time. And that is uh
[2:21] during again King Josiah which his reign
[2:24] was between 640 and 609 BC King Josiah's
[2:27] reign. And I like to read the same text
[2:31] again but in this format because I think
[2:33] it it helps us see it a little bit
[2:35] better. It so talking about God who's in
[2:38] the midst of us that midst of thee is
[2:40] mighty. I I love how if you break it
[2:43] down this is exactly what the verse
[2:44] says. He will save. He will rejoice over
[2:47] thee with joy. He will rest in his love.
[2:50] What a thought, right? He he he rests so
[2:53] much in his love because he knows what
[2:55] it is. There's a trust that there's a
[2:56] power in there. So he would joy over
[2:58] thee with singing.
[3:01] Let that sink in. He God's going to joy
[3:03] over thee. And he he might have a little
[3:05] jig, a little song. Amen. In some places
[3:07] it says with dancing or with shouting
[3:09] and shouting out loud with the shout
[3:11] with the loud shout. So he will save. He
[3:16] will rejoice over thee with joy. He will
[3:19] rest in his love.
[3:22] He will joy over thee with singing.
[3:25] And then so I have a thought here. When
[3:27] God comes by, he does so in his
[3:29] presence, right? Is in the midst of
[3:31] thee. You know how we know that
[3:32] scripture that says he abides in the
[3:34] praises of his people, right? So
[3:37] divinely inspired singing is the Holy
[3:39] Ghost uh the Holy Spirit of God singing
[3:41] in you, right? The believer. Yes, the
[3:43] believer is praising God, but also God
[3:45] serenating over the believer. I don't
[3:47] know if you ever been down the road and
[3:48] all of a sudden you just
[3:50] &gt;&gt; I got my mind made up. You just get a
[3:53] little song and all that. Just don't
[3:56] Yeah. Don't Don't Don't underestimate
[3:57] that. You know, that's that's God's
[3:59] presence coming by. Before you know it,
[4:00] he might talk to you. You might pray.
[4:02] You might be healed. You might, you
[4:04] know, claim your children. It's just God
[4:07] God um God is a God of joy. I just
[4:09] wanted to take that thought and and joy
[4:11] will produce singing
[4:13] &gt;&gt; right
[4:14] &gt;&gt; singing also comes in a way of you know
[4:16] when you have a mourning uh when you
[4:18] you're mourning or when you're sad you
[4:19] know there's there's also that but of
[4:21] but but joy will produce singing
[4:23] &gt;&gt; so divine so I have here salvation as we
[4:26] know sanctification
[4:28] we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[4:30] and glorification of course it will
[4:32] result in singing it you know that is
[4:34] God's rejoicing over you when he's doing
[4:36] these works of you and resting in his
[4:38] love and rejoicing over thee with
[4:40] singing. So just take back uh on that
[4:44] same chapter 3 and 19 through 20 just a
[4:46] little bit of content there and then
[4:47] we'll go into some other some other
[4:50] aspects of this thought.
[4:52] 19 says, "Behold, at that time I will
[4:55] undo all that afflict thee.
[4:59] I will save her
[5:02] that halth, and gather her that was
[5:06] driven out, and I will get them praise
[5:09] and fame in every land where they have
[5:12] been put to shame. At that time, I will
[5:16] bring you again,
[5:18] even in the time that I gather you. For
[5:21] I will make you a name and a praise
[5:23] among all people of the earth when I
[5:27] turn back your captivity before your
[5:30] eyes, saith the Lord. And you see, we
[5:34] sing, the angels sing. We find that in
[5:37] the scriptures. God sings. God loves
[5:41] singing, right? Whether it's him, the
[5:43] angels, or the believer. So in Luke 15:7
[5:47] we have a very familiar scripture uh
[5:49] where it says I say unto you that
[5:52] likewise in the same manner joy shall be
[5:55] in heaven over one sinner that repenteth
[5:59] more than over 90 and nine just persons
[6:03] which need no repentance. So in in most
[6:06] of the translations that word joy says
[6:08] that there's going to be a party in
[6:09] heaven or that there's going to be
[6:10] singing there's going to be shouting
[6:12] that there's going to be there there's
[6:14] going to be rejoicing you know over the
[6:15] one sinner and that's going to be the
[6:17] theme of the topic is in the natural we
[6:19] find that a father joys over his sons
[6:22] walking in righteousness but when
[6:24] they're saved but we're also going to
[6:25] find out how we are begotten right we're
[6:27] we're also we're also a children of God
[6:30] so we become when we're new and we're
[6:32] become born again of course there's
[6:33] going to be a rejoiceing of his heart.
[6:37] So we find here that there was a song of
[6:39] Moses and I like in I like here in
[6:40] Revelations 15 2-4 where it says in
[6:44] verse three and the song of the lamb. So
[6:46] they sang the song of Moses. This is the
[6:49] the uh what we find here and it says
[6:52] saying great and marvelous are thy works
[6:55] Lord God Almighty just and true are thy
[6:57] ways thou king of all saints who shall
[7:00] not fear thee oh Lord and glorify thy
[7:02] name for thou only art holy for all
[7:05] nations shall come and worship before
[7:08] thee for thy judgments are made
[7:10] manifest. I just like to take away here
[7:12] how the song of Moses was still sang
[7:15] again and then the song of the lamb.
[7:18] So God experiences joy himself. Just
[7:20] just think of that for a moment because
[7:22] you sometimes we we forget that you know
[7:24] he does experience joy. So here it is in
[7:28] Hebrew 12 too. looking unto Jesus, the
[7:31] author and the finisher of our faith,
[7:33] who for the joy that was set before him,
[7:37] endured the cross, despising the shame,
[7:41] and is set down at the right hand of the
[7:44] throne of God. In Romans 14:17, it says,
[7:48] "For the kingdom of God is not meat and
[7:51] drink, but righteousness and peace and
[7:55] joy in the Holy Ghost."
[7:58] That's the kingdom of God. So, and in
[8:01] Romans 15:13,
[8:04] it says, "Now the God of hope fill you
[8:07] with all joy and peace in believing that
[8:12] ye may abound in hope through the power
[8:15] of the Holy Ghost." Amen.
[8:19] Galatians 5 uh 22-23 says it's a fruit,
[8:23] right? So the fruit of the but the fruit
[8:25] of the spirit is love, joy. So it's
[8:27] amazing to know that it's it's a fruit.
[8:29] It's a fruit of the Holy Ghost, right?
[8:31] You can only have it once you have the
[8:32] Holy Ghost experience. Peace,
[8:34] longsuffering, gentleness,
[8:37] goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.
[8:40] Against such there's no law. So there's
[8:43] really no law against joy.
[8:45] &gt;&gt; So if you're out there having a little
[8:46] bit of joy, there's no law against that.
[8:50] &gt;&gt; Think about it. So there's no law
[8:51] against joy means that you're free to
[8:53] have joy. It means you're free to walk
[8:54] in joy.
[8:56] It means that you're at Walmart or
[8:58] something and and a thought comes or the
[9:01] word comes by or or an inspiration comes
[9:03] by. There's no law that says you cannot
[9:06] be joyful.
[9:08] &gt;&gt; Think about that. Joy is not given by
[9:10] the world, right? Nor can it be taken
[9:12] away by the world like the little song
[9:14] goes, right?
[9:18] And this is Jesus speaking in John
[9:21] 15:11.
[9:23] These things I have spoken unto you that
[9:26] my joy
[9:29] might remain in you
[9:32] and that your joy might be full.
[9:35] &gt;&gt; This is God's joy, you know, and
[9:36] sometimes we look at it, you know, of
[9:37] course God gives us joy, but sometimes
[9:38] we see it as something that that he
[9:40] gives us and then, you know, goodbye,
[9:43] see you later. But see, he himself is
[9:45] joy. It's an attribute of God. It's the
[9:48] fruit of the Holy Spirit. Right? And joy
[9:50] produces singing. So Psalm 16:11 says,
[9:53] "Thou will show me the path of life. In
[9:57] thy presence is fullness of joy.
[10:01] At the right hand there are pleasures
[10:03] forever more." And the famous uh verse
[10:06] that we use, it's usually a small
[10:08] portion of the big verse that we use is
[10:11] for the joy of the Lord is my is your
[10:14] strength. It's my strength. It's our
[10:16] strength. Amen. And it the content there
[10:19] is is longer, but usually we just say
[10:21] that portion, right? But it is indeed
[10:24] that it is the joy of the Lord. You
[10:26] know, sometimes we just see it again.
[10:28] It's something he gave to you, but it's
[10:29] actually himself. He's a joyful God. So
[10:32] then that produces the believer singing
[10:34] for joy. It'll be a short Sunday school
[10:37] study this morning. So um in Psalms
[10:40] 135-6
[10:42] it says but I have trusted in thy mercy
[10:46] my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.
[10:50] I will sing unto the Lord because he has
[10:53] dealt bountifully with me. Amen. That's
[10:57] the reason why we sing. And especially
[10:59] singing that comes out of joy in the
[11:01] Holy Ghost is is of course is a victory
[11:04] that has that it's it's an overcoming,
[11:06] right? It's a manifestation of an
[11:07] overcoming. Psalm 98:4,
[11:10] "Make a joyful noise unto the Lord.
[11:14] All the earth, make a loud noise and
[11:17] rejoice and sing praise." Amen. And it's
[11:22] something you cannot manufacture. You
[11:23] know, it has to really be the Lord doing
[11:25] it and giving it and giving the
[11:27] inspiration. Psalm 95 says, "Oh come,
[11:30] let us sing unto the Lord. Let us make a
[11:32] joyful noise to the rock of our
[11:34] salvation. Let us come before his
[11:36] presence with thanksgiving and make a
[11:39] joyful noise unto him with psalms. And
[11:42] here's an example of a psalm. So, I'll
[11:45] just pause here and take a break here.
[11:46] Psalm 100. If you don't mind flipping to
[11:48] it, I'm going to teach you a little
[11:50] psalm. All right. I don't have a
[11:53] tambourine here. I don't I don't know
[11:54] how to play instruments, but
[11:57] &gt;&gt; you can make a joyful noise.
[12:00] &gt;&gt; Really? Yeah. I don't have a good beat,
[12:02] though.
[12:06] Yeah, I'm not a musician, but I sure can
[12:08] make a joyful noise, and I sure could
[12:10] have the joy to praise him. Right.
[12:12] &gt;&gt; All right. Psalm 100. Just listen to
[12:14] this song. I learned this from some of
[12:16] the brothers from Arizona, the church uh
[12:18] Love Divine, and I think it came from
[12:19] the brothers from California, the
[12:21] original church that worked that got
[12:22] started there. So, this is this is
[12:24] straight up word. In Psalm 100, I'll
[12:27] start as slow as this. Make a joyful
[12:29] noise unto the Lord, all ye, all ye
[12:34] lands. Serve the Lord, the Lord with
[12:37] gladness. Come before his presence with
[12:40] singing. Know ye that the Lord, he is
[12:44] good. It is he, he that hath made us,
[12:48] and not we, we ourselves. We are his
[12:51] people and the sheep of his pasture.
[12:54] Enter into his gates with thanksgiving
[12:58] and into his courts with praise. Be
[13:01] thankful unto him and bless his name,
[13:05] his name forever.
[13:07] For the Lord, the Lord is good and his
[13:11] mercy is everlasting
[13:14] and his truth end truth endureth
[13:18] endureth to all generations.
[13:21] Hallelujah. Glory. Hallelujah. And then
[13:24] it sings again and it goes on again. I
[13:27] missed that second verse, but um I love
[13:30] those songs, right? Because you're it's
[13:32] it's the it's the joy of the Lord. It's
[13:34] you're singing about his word. You're
[13:35] you're praising him.
[13:38] This is another that says, "This is the
[13:40] day.
[13:42] This is the day which the Lord hath
[13:45] made." Which the Lord hath made. We will
[13:50] rejoice.
[13:51] We will rejoice and be glad in it. And
[13:55] then it goes to a higher tone.
[13:58] Amen. Well, praise the Lord. And I just
[14:00] think that God's word is perfect. I love
[14:03] that he rejoices over thee with singing.
[14:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:06] &gt;&gt; And he gives us that inspiration. In
[14:08] Isaiah 61:10, it says, "I will greatly
[14:11] rejoice in the Lord. My soul shall be
[14:15] joyful in my God, for he hath clothed me
[14:20] with the garments of salvation. He hath
[14:23] covered me with the robe of
[14:26] righteousness. It's not just meaningless
[14:28] praise, right? As a bridegroom decketh
[14:32] himself with ornaments
[14:34] and as the bride
[14:36] adornneth herself with jewels.
[14:40] bridegroom, you know, it's it's decking
[14:42] himself with ornaments and the bride
[14:45] adornneth herself with jewels. So,
[14:48] sisters, you might know that's kind of a
[14:49] type for you. You might know how much
[14:50] joy you get
[14:53] when you're when you're getting dressed
[14:54] with jewels. It says Psalm 92, I will be
[14:57] glad and rejoice in thee. I will sing
[15:00] praise to thy name, although most high.
[15:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And in Psalm 119 111 the word
[15:10] right. So thy testimonies
[15:12] have I taken as a heritage. Imagine that
[15:15] an inheritance right forever. For they
[15:18] the words thy testimonies thy precepts
[15:21] are the rejoicing of my heart. Isn't
[15:24] that beautiful? Is to have the gift to
[15:26] be able to have that joy that comes
[15:28] through just the trust and knowing that
[15:30] God's testimonies are sure and his word
[15:32] is is settled forever. It's a heritage.
[15:36] Psalm 19:8-10.
[15:38] It goes, "The statues of the Lord are
[15:42] right,
[15:44] rejoicing the heart.
[15:49] The commandments of the Lord is pure,
[15:54] enlightening the eyes."
[15:58] And then it goes, "More to be desired
[16:02] are they than gold." Yeah. Much much
[16:06] grow
[16:09] sweeter also than honey
[16:14] and the honeycomb.
[16:16] Amen.
[16:17] &gt;&gt; In nine it says, "The fear of the Lord
[16:19] is clean, enduring forever. The
[16:22] judgments of the Lord are true and
[16:23] righteous alltogether." Amen. And I
[16:26] encourage the the people that are
[16:27] inspired to sing, the people that know
[16:29] how to sing to to find the tunes to
[16:32] these songs that some psalmists have
[16:33] already because man, you can't go wrong
[16:35] by singing God's word, singing his
[16:37] psalms and getting under that
[16:39] inspiration and and just in that
[16:41] anointing and and and getting into the
[16:43] same inspiration that the psalmist had.
[16:45] They're pomic, you know, they're there's
[16:47] rhythm to it and they're even as we read
[16:49] them, we we rejoice even without the the
[16:52] singing just because it's God's poem to
[16:56] us.
[16:56] &gt;&gt; It's God serverating to you. You know, I
[16:58] just have a quick testimony here. in
[17:01] Mother's Day in Mexico, my mom um my
[17:04] father was out um working in another
[17:07] country and and so here it is mother's
[17:10] days and four or five in the morning
[17:13] before the breakup light comes a guitar
[17:16] to the window and here I am. I was
[17:19] sleeping with her. I was probably like
[17:20] four or five. I can barely remember
[17:21] this. And I just start hearing some
[17:24] strings. I don't know if you ever woken
[17:26] up to a serenade.
[17:28] Uh, not me personally from a from my
[17:32] wife playing the cello or something, but
[17:34] that'll be nice. But it it was special.
[17:37] It it stuck to me because it was like a
[17:40] morning serenade.
[17:42] You know, you musicians that God can put
[17:44] a song in your heart. That's that's
[17:46] special. That's God's coming by in his
[17:48] word and his singing,
[17:50] &gt;&gt; rejoicing over you with singing.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; Take that and and run with it. you know,
[17:55] make the
[17:57] write it down and write psalms and sing
[18:00] specials. I I just think it's beautiful
[18:03] and and it had such an impact on me
[18:05] because that song was singing to the
[18:08] mother, right? It was singing the and
[18:11] that song in Spanish. It says, "I'm
[18:13] singing you the morning uh songs that
[18:15] David would sing." So, it's it's
[18:17] amazing, right? Even even the musicians,
[18:19] right? in their in their inspiration
[18:21] just saying that I'm just singing you
[18:22] that those psalms sisters and musicians
[18:24] will sing and and giving thanks to you
[18:27] know for the attribute of being a mother
[18:29] boy I she was wetting her her pillow
[18:32] with but she was crying you know she it
[18:34] had an effect on her because here he is
[18:36] her husband's abroad Mother's Day it's a
[18:40] big deal in Mexico Mother's Day you know
[18:43] so to me it just it just uh that's a
[18:46] good image right there of what a morning
[18:47] serenade
[18:49] And then Proverbs 23:24 is just a last
[18:52] thought is how God rejoices when one
[18:54] soul is saved and it typifies here also
[18:56] a father relationship as a son we joy
[18:59] when our children are walking in truth.
[19:02] Um but we but also think about it when
[19:04] God rejoices and the whole point is that
[19:07] God has joy. It says Proverbs 23:24,
[19:12] "The father of the righteous shall
[19:15] greatly rejoice, and he that beggetth a
[19:20] wise child shall have joy of him." It's
[19:24] in the natural, but also think about it
[19:26] in the spiritual, right? When you become
[19:28] born again, you've been given the wisdom
[19:30] of God and and you be given
[19:32] righteousness and you're given God's
[19:33] wisdom. So therefore, God rejoices.
[19:37] God is happy over that. In 3 John 4, we
[19:40] know where it says, "I have no greater
[19:43] joy than to hear that my children walk
[19:45] in truth." And may the Lord grant that
[19:47] to each and every one of us parents.
[19:50] &gt;&gt; May the Lord grant May we all just just
[19:52] see it from the children going upward
[19:54] though that our parents in natural joy
[19:56] and God who is our spiritual father
[19:58] rejoices. And wrapping it up here.
[20:00] Proverbs 23:15-16.
[20:02] My son,
[20:04] if thine heart be wise, my heart, this
[20:07] is him speaking, shall rejoice or a
[20:10] father in the proverb, right? Even mine,
[20:15] yep, my reigns shall rejoice when thy
[20:18] lips when thy lips uh speak right
[20:20] things. Let's take it for granted, you
[20:23] know, that God joys over these. So, just
[20:24] in summary, God in the midst of thee is
[20:27] mighty. God in the midst of you is
[20:29] mighty. He will save. He will rejoice
[20:32] over thee with joy. That sounds like a
[20:34] happy time to me. He will rest in his
[20:37] love. Suress.
[20:40] Assurance. He will joy over thee with
[20:42] singing.
[20:44] There's a Zephaniah in New American
[20:47] translation uh which um it's a pretty
[20:50] solid translation. It's not some of the
[20:52] newer ones. And it says, "The Lord your
[20:53] God is in your midst a victorious
[20:56] warrior. He will exalt over you with
[20:59] joy. He will be quiet in his love. He
[21:02] will rejoice over you with shouts of
[21:04] joy. Amen. And then Psalm 22:3, "But
[21:08] thou art holy, oh thou that inhabits the
[21:12] praises of Israel." God loves worship.
[21:16] God loves singing. Last quote here in
[21:18] the message, Broken Sisters, back in '
[21:19] 64, when David said, "Make a joyful
[21:22] noise unto the Lord. Praise him upon
[21:25] harps. Praise him upon the sultry. Let
[21:29] everything that has breath praise the
[21:31] Lord and praise ye the Lord.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[21:34] &gt;&gt; God rejoices. So God has joy. God
[21:37] rejoices in his people. That's the
[21:40] theme. Let them all It says let them
[21:44] let them of the learned say amen. When
[21:47] anything said right is said that's
[21:50] right.
[21:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all. Have a good
[21:53] worship time and a good good preaching
[21:55] today. Amen. Thank you Jesus.
