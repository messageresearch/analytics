[59:16] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[59:19] we pray and all all the Believers said
[59:23] a man and amen John the 12th chapter and
[59:27] in the 23rd verse the Bible says here
[59:29] that Jesus answered them saying the hour
[59:33] is come notice this the hour has come
[59:36] that the son of man should be glorified
[59:39] brother Brian said the forming of the
[59:42] body of Jesus Christ now verily verily I
[59:45] say unto you except a corn of wheat fall
[59:47] into the ground and die it abideth alone
[59:51] but if it die it bringeth forth much
[59:54] fruit amen it bringeth forth much fruit
[59:57] he that loveth his life shall lose it
[1:00:00] and he that hateth his life in this
[1:00:01] world shall keep it unto life eternal
[1:00:04] and if any man serve me let him follow
[1:00:08] me and where I am there shall also my
[1:00:11] servant be if any man serve me him will
[1:00:15] my father honor amen now in verse 25 the
[1:00:19] Bible there is speaking of life and I
[1:00:21] believe that is Promised life I'm
[1:00:23] believe that is the life of God amen
[1:00:25] amen I believe that's what we're
[1:00:27] promised or we are heirs to now in the
[1:00:30] book of Colossians the first chapter
[1:00:33] Colossians of the first chapter and in
[1:00:36] the the first verse of Colossians sorry
[1:00:39] the first chapter of Colossians the
[1:00:42] ninth verse Paul here writing in
[1:00:44] Colossians 9 and he says for this cause
[1:00:47] we also since today we heard it do not
[1:00:50] cease to pray for you and to desire that
[1:00:53] ye may be filled somebody say field
[1:00:55] that you may be filled with the
[1:00:58] knowledge of his will and all wisdom and
[1:01:01] spiritual understanding notice this that
[1:01:04] one that now it should be filled with
[1:01:06] these things but watch the next verse
[1:01:08] that you might walk worthy of the Lord
[1:01:11] so you're filled with something then you
[1:01:13] might walk worthy of the Lord unto all
[1:01:15] pleasing being fruitful and every good
[1:01:18] work and increasing in the knowledge of
[1:01:20] God strengthened with all might
[1:01:23] according to his glorious power unto all
[1:01:26] patience and long-suffering with
[1:01:27] joyfulness giving thanks unto the Father
[1:01:30] which hath made us meet to be partakers
[1:01:32] of the inheritance of the Saints in
[1:01:35] light who hath delivered us from the
[1:01:38] power of Darkness notice this and hath
[1:01:41] translated us into the kingdom of his
[1:01:45] dear son amen and one other place I want
[1:01:47] to look is Galatians 4
[1:01:50] Galatians 4 and verse 19 you all forgive
[1:01:54] me this morning for having so many
[1:01:56] scriptures it's just some things here
[1:01:57] I've been looking out on my heart and
[1:01:59] maybe just to read these to give us a
[1:02:01] background in Galatians 4 and verse 19
[1:02:04] Paul again writing says my little
[1:02:07] children of whom I travail in birth
[1:02:10] again until Christ be formed in you now
[1:02:15] if you skip down to the 27th verse he
[1:02:17] says for it is written Rejoice thou
[1:02:20] Barren that bearth not break forth and
[1:02:22] cry that thou travail us not for the
[1:02:25] desolate hath many more children than
[1:02:27] she which hath and husband now we
[1:02:30] Brethren as Isaac was are the children
[1:02:32] of promise but as then he that was born
[1:02:35] after the flesh persecuted him that was
[1:02:37] born after the spirit even so it is now
[1:02:41] nevertheless what saith the scripture
[1:02:43] cast out the bonds woman and her son for
[1:02:47] the son of the bonds woman shall not be
[1:02:49] Heir with the son of the free woman so
[1:02:52] then brethren we we could put our joy
[1:02:54] shoes on right here couldn't we so then
[1:02:56] brethren we are not the children of the
[1:02:59] bonds woman but of the free amen we ask
[1:03:02] the Lord this morning to add the
[1:03:03] blessing to the reading of his word as
[1:03:05] you can have your seats here this
[1:03:06] morning I want to by the help of the
[1:03:09] Lord for just a few moments I want to
[1:03:10] speak to you here on a thought and if I
[1:03:13] would title this this morning I want to
[1:03:15] speak to you on worthy of the full
[1:03:17] promise amen worthy of the full promise
[1:03:20] you know I I believe that we as humans
[1:03:23] sometimes we we struggle and I believe
[1:03:25] we struggle sometimes with the thought
[1:03:27] amen of being worthy are we really
[1:03:31] worthy am I worthy are you worthy who
[1:03:33] who is worthy but thank God for sending
[1:03:36] us a prophet in this generation amen
[1:03:38] that can actually bring an answer to the
[1:03:41] question of Are We worthy in the message
[1:03:43] communion 1963 he said now we know that
[1:03:47] we are not worthy in ourselves so right
[1:03:49] there he's just answered it we're not
[1:03:51] worthy in ourselves none of us are but
[1:03:54] but that we are not trusting in our own
[1:03:56] worthiness
[1:03:57] he said he is worthiness that we have
[1:04:00] died to our own thinking and we just
[1:04:03] think his thoughts and live to
[1:04:04] everything amen that we believe he
[1:04:08] commands us to and we look back and see
[1:04:11] where we're living and look our life
[1:04:12] over then if we're not doing the things
[1:04:15] that's not worthy of the Gospel amen
[1:04:17] then we shouldn't take the communion now
[1:04:19] I believe in communion I believe that we
[1:04:22] should have it in our churches I believe
[1:04:23] in a I believe in a natural communion as
[1:04:26] well as I believe in a spiritual
[1:04:27] communion I don't believe it meant that
[1:04:29] we should just have communion once a
[1:04:31] year or once a month amen or I mean let
[1:04:34] me rephrase it I don't believe that we
[1:04:35] should just have communion when the
[1:04:37] church has communion I believe that
[1:04:39] there should be a continual communion
[1:04:41] amen between the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:04:44] and her husband the bridegroom amen
[1:04:46] because he has made her worthy to have
[1:04:50] fellowship with him now amen I love
[1:04:52] there in Galatians 4 28 Paul says amen
[1:04:55] that we now Brethren as Isaac was amen
[1:04:57] we we are the children of promise now
[1:05:00] amen the Bible says that children have
[1:05:02] promised other places the Bible says the
[1:05:04] children of God now when you break into
[1:05:06] this children of promised children of
[1:05:08] God in the Old Testament you'll find
[1:05:10] that the people of Israel amen were
[1:05:13] considered the children of Promise amen
[1:05:15] and they were especially dear to God now
[1:05:18] in the Old Testament we know Israel amen
[1:05:20] was considered the the the the people
[1:05:23] amen who were near to God now in the New
[1:05:25] Testament in Paul's writing amen we find
[1:05:28] that all who are led by the spirit of
[1:05:30] God Amen are thus closely related to God
[1:05:34] are the children of Promise so in the
[1:05:36] Old Testament Israel was considered the
[1:05:38] children of Promise Amen in the New
[1:05:40] Testament according to Paul's writings
[1:05:43] amen every child that's led by the
[1:05:46] spirit of God Amen is considered the
[1:05:48] children of promise now you all know
[1:05:50] that there is a natural Israel amen as
[1:05:53] well as a spiritual Israel and the
[1:05:55] prophet said it this way he said we are
[1:05:57] Israelites now think about that we are
[1:06:00] Israelites because we are the Seed of
[1:06:03] Abraham
[1:06:04] now that Israelite is not that which is
[1:06:08] of the flesh amen but it is that which
[1:06:10] is of the spirit amen it's not that
[1:06:13] which is of the flesh amen but it is
[1:06:15] that which is of the spirit in the book
[1:06:18] of in the book of Galatians Paul is
[1:06:20] saying we are amen the children of
[1:06:23] promise we are Israelites we are we are
[1:06:26] a spiritual Israel not by flesh amen but
[1:06:30] by Spirit now in the message Jehovah
[1:06:32] Jireh 1962 brother Ben said oh I'm so
[1:06:35] glad to be a Christian how many can can
[1:06:37] say that this morning I'm so glad to be
[1:06:39] a Christian he said I wouldn't trade
[1:06:41] places with nobody in the world not
[1:06:43] presidents or Kings if they'd give me
[1:06:46] the whole world said I could live a
[1:06:48] million years and I wouldn't die after
[1:06:50] the million years but now a million
[1:06:52] years amen while that won't be nothing
[1:06:54] now see just keep on living no death
[1:06:56] amen but it's great to be a Christian he
[1:06:59] said we're talking of Abraham he said
[1:07:01] now let's go back now we are Abraham's
[1:07:03] seed if we are in Christ Christ and then
[1:07:05] if you're Abraham's seed you have the
[1:07:08] same faith that Abraham had because it
[1:07:11] was his faith that we're talking about
[1:07:12] amen especially in the church now it's
[1:07:16] the Royal Seed of Abraham these two
[1:07:19] seeds of Abraham one of them was the
[1:07:21] natural Isaac amen and the other one was
[1:07:24] Christ The Promise amen so Isaac was the
[1:07:27] natural seed Christ amen was the promise
[1:07:30] seed amen so that through Isaac Israel
[1:07:32] would be blessed and through Christ amen
[1:07:35] he would become the father of Nations so
[1:07:37] amen the Royal seed how much greater
[1:07:40] that would be amen than the natural Seed
[1:07:43] of Abraham so if you are in Christ how
[1:07:46] many is in Christ amen if you are in
[1:07:48] Christ you have a supersede amen a super
[1:07:51] to what Abraham was because you come by
[1:07:55] the Royal Sea Christ and if you are dead
[1:07:58] in Christ then are you Abraham's
[1:08:00] children and you have Abraham's seed in
[1:08:02] Abraham's faith and Abraham's Faith was
[1:08:05] in God's word amen regardless of what
[1:08:08] took place he called those things which
[1:08:10] were not as though they were amen
[1:08:13] because God said so what a promise amen
[1:08:16] then we are the children of Promise amen
[1:08:19] through the blessing of Jesus Christ now
[1:08:22] I want to say it to you this way we are
[1:08:24] not a hybrid church we are not the
[1:08:26] hybrid seed I believe amen that we are a
[1:08:29] part of the original seed amen because
[1:08:31] if we're a hybrid amen then a hybrid
[1:08:34] germ cannot rise once it goes down when
[1:08:37] a hybrid germ goes down it's finished
[1:08:39] amen but watch now if it's an original
[1:08:42] germ or an original seed amen that seed
[1:08:46] can go down but it can also raise again
[1:08:49] amen that's why the blessing of
[1:08:51] Resurrection is upon your life it's
[1:08:54] because you are not just a part of the
[1:08:56] natural seed amen but you are a part of
[1:08:58] a spiritual seed that has received the
[1:09:01] promise of Resurrection
[1:09:03] now when you start talking about
[1:09:05] promises you got to realize real quick
[1:09:07] that the promises are not made to just
[1:09:10] anybody they're not just thrown out
[1:09:12] there to anybody that wants to come
[1:09:13] along and believe these promises the
[1:09:16] promises are made to the seed come on
[1:09:19] fathers you got children you got seed
[1:09:21] amen you didn't promise an inheritance
[1:09:24] to every child in this world Amen but to
[1:09:26] your seed you have promised an
[1:09:28] inheritance in the Book of Genesis the
[1:09:31] 22nd chapter 15th verse the Bible said
[1:09:34] that the angel of the Lord called unto
[1:09:35] Abraham Out of Heaven the second time
[1:09:37] and said by myself have I sworn saith
[1:09:41] the Lord for because thou has done this
[1:09:43] thing and if not withheld thy son amen
[1:09:46] thine only son that in blessing I Will
[1:09:48] Bless thee
[1:09:50] in multiplying I will multiply that seed
[1:09:53] as the stars of the heaven and as the
[1:09:56] sand which is upon the seashore now
[1:09:58] watch this and thy seed amen shall
[1:10:01] possess the Gate of his enemies do you
[1:10:04] see the Promise now the promises coming
[1:10:06] to the seed amen thy seed shall be as
[1:10:09] the stars of the Heaven and the
[1:10:11] sandwiches upon the seashore thy seed
[1:10:14] shall possess the Gate of his enemies
[1:10:15] verse 18 and in thy seed shall all the
[1:10:18] nations of the earth be blessed amen
[1:10:21] because thou Hast obeyed my voice
[1:10:23] remember I'm sitting possessing the
[1:10:25] gates of the enemy God has been testing
[1:10:28] the patriarch because he had given him a
[1:10:30] promise and when God makes a promise he
[1:10:33] wants to be sure that this person is
[1:10:35] worthy of the promise amen before he
[1:10:38] fulfills it and when he said or what he
[1:10:40] promises so listen amen the only thing
[1:10:43] that can make you worthy of the Father's
[1:10:45] Promise is to be a seed of the father
[1:10:48] who has made the promise concerning you
[1:10:50] your life listen Church Isaac amen was
[1:10:53] not of Hagar amen he was of Sarah amen
[1:10:57] and Hagar was never considered in the
[1:10:59] promise amen but Sarah was come on now
[1:11:02] amen that's why the Bible said cast out
[1:11:05] the bonds woman because her son shall
[1:11:07] not be Heir with a free woman and I'm
[1:11:10] going to go ahead and preach since I'm
[1:11:11] here amen there's no room in the house
[1:11:13] of God Amen for the bonds woman's ideas
[1:11:16] there's no room in the house of God Amen
[1:11:19] for Ishmael worship we are the Freeborn
[1:11:22] Sons and Daughters of the Living God and
[1:11:25] if we're going to act like bonds woman
[1:11:26] children we ought to start thinking like
[1:11:28] bonds woman's children and we ought to
[1:11:30] start thinking about judgment we ought
[1:11:32] to start thinking about tribulation
[1:11:34] because that's where that seed is headed
[1:11:36] but there's a free woman seed and her
[1:11:39] seed is not headed for judgment it's not
[1:11:42] headed for tribulation I've got a direct
[1:11:44] quote where the prophet of God said the
[1:11:46] free woman's children goes in the
[1:11:48] rapture
[1:11:49] well somebody shall Hallelujah the free
[1:11:52] woman's children is going in the rapture
[1:11:57] ah when you think about this Abraham had
[1:11:59] been promised that through this seed
[1:12:01] amen the whole world would be blessed
[1:12:03] that he would have a son and this son
[1:12:06] out of him should come forth a seed amen
[1:12:08] that would bless the whole earth and
[1:12:10] Abraham when this promise was given 75
[1:12:13] years old Sarah 65 amen but the Bible
[1:12:17] tells us that Abraham staggered not at
[1:12:20] the promise of God through unbelief but
[1:12:22] was strong given praise to God Amen and
[1:12:26] God Time After Time amen tested him
[1:12:29] until he finally come to the final test
[1:12:32] before the blessing was going to happen
[1:12:34] he said the final test to see how amen
[1:12:38] that you will react upon it and when he
[1:12:40] had give Abraham this test he found that
[1:12:43] Abraham was just as true as he was when
[1:12:46] he started amen when the final test come
[1:12:49] to Abraham to fulfill the promise upon
[1:12:52] its life amen God found that Abraham was
[1:12:56] just as worthy at the end as he was at
[1:12:59] the beginning he found out he was just
[1:13:01] as faithful amen as though I feel like
[1:13:03] preaching he was just as faithful at the
[1:13:06] end as he was at the beginning listen
[1:13:08] Church there's a bride on this Earth
[1:13:10] amen and she's not a denominational
[1:13:12] hybrid she is a part of that original
[1:13:15] life she's a part of that Original Seed
[1:13:18] and what she was in the beginning is
[1:13:21] what she won't be in the ending and if
[1:13:23] she was faithful in the beginning she
[1:13:25] will be faithful in the if she was holy
[1:13:28] in the beginning she will be holy in the
[1:13:30] end listen there's a bride on the Earth
[1:13:32] today who will be found worthy to
[1:13:35] receive the Fulfillment of every Divine
[1:13:38] promise
[1:13:40] not based upon your worthiness not based
[1:13:43] upon my worthiness but based upon him
[1:13:46] who hath made us worthy now the Bible
[1:13:48] says in Galatians 3 16. now to Abraham
[1:13:52] and his seed amen were the promises made
[1:13:54] he hath not said and to seeds as a man
[1:13:58] but as of one and to thy seed which is
[1:14:01] Christ
[1:14:03] now in the message the feet is not here
[1:14:05] with the shark he said hear the seed won
[1:14:08] one seed Not seeds but one seed these
[1:14:11] others were not Seed of Abraham because
[1:14:14] Abraham's seed was his faith seed that
[1:14:16] God was speaking of not his natural seed
[1:14:19] amen because after Sarah died Abraham
[1:14:21] married another woman and had seven sons
[1:14:24] besides daughters so it wouldn't be
[1:14:26] Abraham's seeds it was Abraham's seed
[1:14:30] one and it was Abraham's Faith seed amen
[1:14:33] which was pointing to the Royal seed
[1:14:35] that was to come through Abraham's Faith
[1:14:37] amen not Abraham's Natural Life
[1:14:40] Abraham's spiritual life who took
[1:14:43] everything contrary to God's word and
[1:14:46] called it as though it was not and
[1:14:49] believed God against hope believe that
[1:14:52] hope that's the real seed amen that
[1:14:54] we're speaking of Amen so through
[1:14:56] Abraham's Faith would come of Faith seed
[1:14:59] which would be a royal seed and the
[1:15:02] prophet in the seed is not air with a
[1:15:04] shack will call this bride amen the
[1:15:06] Royal seed bride whoa brother you are
[1:15:11] the Royal seed bride and the prophet of
[1:15:14] God will sing rise in the sun he'll say
[1:15:16] there's been churches churches there's
[1:15:18] been Brides brides churches Brides
[1:15:20] brides but there has got to come one
[1:15:22] amen that has to become a real bride
[1:15:25] there must be one that God only got the
[1:15:28] mechanics amen but the Dynamics of it
[1:15:30] that makes the church live and move in
[1:15:33] the power of his resurrection paragraph
[1:15:35] 111 and is he being the groom the bride
[1:15:38] has to come forth because it's a part of
[1:15:41] him and it can only be the manifestation
[1:15:44] of the fulfilling of all the revelations
[1:15:47] any others that spoke of the Bride it
[1:15:50] can only manifest and if it does
[1:15:52] something different from the groom then
[1:15:54] it isn't the bride because she is flesh
[1:15:58] of his flesh she is bone of his bone
[1:16:00] life of his life power this power she he
[1:16:03] is him come on church amen the alpha has
[1:16:07] become the Omega amen what was in the
[1:16:10] beginning is now in the ending amen she
[1:16:13] is him
[1:16:14] now the prophet says there's a man and
[1:16:16] woman or one woman take from his side
[1:16:18] she had taken a spirit the feminist
[1:16:20] Spirit from him the flesh from his side
[1:16:23] made both mechanics and Dynamics the
[1:16:25] wife amen the spirit of him and the
[1:16:28] Flesh of him put it together and made
[1:16:30] mechanics and Dynamics now I've been
[1:16:33] preaching you know I've been preaching
[1:16:34] long enough to run into some interesting
[1:16:36] things and I remember one time I was
[1:16:38] preaching in church and I was preaching
[1:16:40] on the Dynamics of the fire of God the
[1:16:42] Holy Ghost as soon as I got done met
[1:16:44] some guy at the back door and you know
[1:16:45] how it is preach a heart out and there's
[1:16:47] always that one person you know and then
[1:16:49] I met him at the back door and he said
[1:16:51] you know what brother he said you're in
[1:16:52] the wrong Church to preach this I said
[1:16:54] what do you mean he said we're not a
[1:16:56] Dynamics Church we're a mechanics church
[1:16:58] I said oh so you're not going in the
[1:17:00] rapture
[1:17:02] now you say well you're pretty bold well
[1:17:05] the prophet of God said it's going to
[1:17:07] take the mechanics and the Dynamics then
[1:17:09] you get some people now come on Church
[1:17:11] you get some people and all they want is
[1:17:13] Dynamics and no mechanics and what you
[1:17:15] get is you get two ditches and you get a
[1:17:18] bunch of people trying to preach out of
[1:17:19] the ditch and can't nobody stay in the
[1:17:21] middle of the road amen but I believe
[1:17:23] that there's a bride who is not in a
[1:17:26] mechanics ditch and she's not in a
[1:17:28] dynamic Stitch but she's in the middle
[1:17:30] of the road that Isaiah said there will
[1:17:32] be a highway and there'll be a way and
[1:17:34] it'll be called the way of Holiness and
[1:17:37] I believe there's a bride who is walking
[1:17:38] in the middle of the road manifesting
[1:17:42] the mechanics because the Dynamics have
[1:17:44] struck the mechanics all right what are
[1:17:47] you saying I'm saying this bride is not
[1:17:49] just sitting around quoting quotes and
[1:17:51] fussing an arrogant and debating and
[1:17:53] trying to break down words and neither
[1:17:55] is she running all over the building
[1:17:57] with a bunch of smoke and no fire in the
[1:17:59] engine amen but I believe this bride
[1:18:01] isn't most powerful force of people that
[1:18:04] is on the face of the Earth Amen to
[1:18:06] declare the mechanics of the word of God
[1:18:08] with a manifestation of the same
[1:18:11] dynamics that fell in the upper room has
[1:18:14] fallen in the Church of the Living God
[1:18:16] and is manifesting come on Church you
[1:18:19] all know the quote if he fired on 16
[1:18:22] cylinders she'll fire on 16 cylinders
[1:18:25] too
[1:18:26] ain't just a bunch of mechanics this
[1:18:29] ain't just a bunch of Dynamics it's the
[1:18:31] mechanics and the Dynamics coming
[1:18:33] together it's the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:18:36] who has been given the greatest
[1:18:38] privileges is to Bow our heads Amen to
[1:18:41] Humble ourself to reverence the
[1:18:43] mechanics amen but to open up our hearts
[1:18:46] to the Living God Amen to bring a living
[1:18:49] Christ into a dying generation listen
[1:18:52] friends our young people need more than
[1:18:54] a bunch of mechanics they need more than
[1:18:56] a bunch of arguing over quotes they need
[1:18:59] the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost they
[1:19:01] meant to burn with fire and reality and
[1:19:04] strength in their lives
[1:19:06] now you say preacher you sure are saying
[1:19:09] right Dynamics I am because this is ride
[1:19:12] time
[1:19:13] this is bright time Revelation 1 3 the
[1:19:17] Bible says it very plain blessed is he
[1:19:19] that readeth and they that hear the
[1:19:21] words of this prophecy and keep those
[1:19:24] things which are written therein why for
[1:19:26] the time is at hand now the prophet of
[1:19:29] God says that time is at hand he said
[1:19:32] the time amen was not previously in the
[1:19:34] wisdom and economy of God this Mighty
[1:19:36] Revelation so this is not some little
[1:19:39] something this is a mighty Revelation
[1:19:41] though fully known to God could not cut
[1:19:44] forth hitherto thus we immediately learn
[1:19:47] a principle that the revelation of God
[1:19:50] can only come in the age and at a
[1:19:53] specific time see look at Israel look at
[1:19:55] Jesus he said and in this age of
[1:19:57] laodicea the revelation of God will come
[1:20:01] in it's due time it will not falter and
[1:20:04] neither will it be premature the
[1:20:07] revelation of God will not come in a
[1:20:10] premature season it will not come in a
[1:20:12] way that will cause you falter this
[1:20:14] revelation will come at the appointed
[1:20:17] time now the word revelation 1 3 says
[1:20:20] the time is at hand I love that word
[1:20:22] time brother brother Wade that word time
[1:20:25] means opportunity it means a fixed and
[1:20:28] definite time it is the time when things
[1:20:31] are brought to a crisis so when the time
[1:20:33] is at hand it's the opportunity it's the
[1:20:37] time when things have come to a crisis
[1:20:39] and the prophet said oh Christian what
[1:20:41] an opportunity we have we have
[1:20:43] opportunities that Saint Paul never
[1:20:45] dreamed of having we have opportunities
[1:20:47] that Enoch and Elijah and all of them
[1:20:50] never had the opportunities that we have
[1:20:53] now you say preacher why can you
[1:20:55] announce to the church that we have
[1:20:57] opportunities because this is the hour
[1:21:00] of the fullness of all things this is
[1:21:02] the hour when the cup of iniquity is
[1:21:05] becoming full this is the hour When sin
[1:21:07] has become the fullness of this nation
[1:21:09] this is the hour when religion has
[1:21:12] reached the fullness of church eternity
[1:21:13] but it's also at the time when the bride
[1:21:16] has stepped down of the confusion of
[1:21:18] denomination and she's in the fullness
[1:21:21] of the revelation of the full word with
[1:21:24] full power with full strength with full
[1:21:26] Authority with full healing with full
[1:21:29] blessings with full faith with full
[1:21:32] Grace with full Mercy with full
[1:21:34] anointing come on Church you have been
[1:21:37] tried by the word and you have been
[1:21:39] found worthy to receive the fullness of
[1:21:43] the promise of God in the age that
[1:21:45] you're living in
[1:21:47] Romans 15 29 says it beautiful amen I am
[1:21:51] sure that when I come unto you I shall
[1:21:54] come in the fullness of the blessing
[1:21:58] we are here this morning in the fullness
[1:22:01] of the blessing of the gospel of Christ
[1:22:03] in Ephesians 1 10 Paul again says that
[1:22:06] in the dispensation of the fullness of
[1:22:08] times he might gather together in one
[1:22:11] all things in Christ
[1:22:13] are you ready both which are in heaven
[1:22:16] and which are on the earth notice where
[1:22:20] we're being gathered even in him in
[1:22:22] Ephesians 3 19 and to know the love of
[1:22:25] Christ which passeth knowledge that she
[1:22:28] might be filled with all the fullness of
[1:22:31] God look at this word fullness that
[1:22:34] which is has been filled amen notice
[1:22:36] that which feels or which a thing is
[1:22:38] filled of those things which a ship is
[1:22:41] filled amen it is the fullness it is the
[1:22:43] abundance I love this one brother
[1:22:45] brother Wade it's a keeping so whatever
[1:22:48] the church is filled with is what's
[1:22:50] keeping her whatever the church is full
[1:22:53] of is her keeping power it's her
[1:22:56] sustaining power listen and I'll say
[1:22:58] this we are not like denominations who
[1:23:01] is satisfied amen with halfway
[1:23:03] intellectual conversions we are not
[1:23:06] hybrids that are satisfied but just
[1:23:08] partial understanding but we have
[1:23:11] received a more sure word of Prophecy
[1:23:14] from a son of man who is revealing be
[1:23:18] sin of man and you know what he said he
[1:23:20] said all that was in God he poured into
[1:23:23] Christ and all that was in Christ he has
[1:23:26] poured into the church listen not half
[1:23:28] of what was in God was poured into
[1:23:30] Christ and half of what was in Christ
[1:23:32] was poured in the church but all the
[1:23:35] fullness everything that was in God he
[1:23:38] poured into Christ and everything that's
[1:23:41] in Christ has been poured
[1:23:43] hell church if we're living like a
[1:23:46] bachelor about your peasants and about
[1:23:48] your slaves we're living underneath our
[1:23:50] privileges if we're sitting here trying
[1:23:52] to get good enough Amen to work
[1:23:54] something out of God and to make
[1:23:56] something we're never going to get
[1:23:57] nothing the way we get something is
[1:24:00] recognize what he's done for us
[1:24:03] all that was in God he poured into
[1:24:06] Christ all that was in Christ he poured
[1:24:09] into the church see that's why Paul said
[1:24:11] amen that in him do Ever Fall the
[1:24:14] fullness of the god head bodily and ye
[1:24:17] are complete in him which is the head of
[1:24:21] all principality and power ye are
[1:24:24] complete in Christ I love what the
[1:24:27] prophet said he said these who are of
[1:24:29] the royal seed are the elect of God or
[1:24:32] the predestinated for known of God and
[1:24:35] we're in the mind of God and His
[1:24:37] Thoughts in very plain language the true
[1:24:40] bride of Christ was in the mind of God
[1:24:43] eternally though not expressed until
[1:24:46] each came forth in the designated decree
[1:24:49] season and as each member came forth it
[1:24:52] became expressed and took its place in
[1:24:55] the body oh don't you love this thus
[1:24:57] this bride is the literal spoken word
[1:25:01] seed right thus this bride is the
[1:25:04] literal spoken word Saint bride then
[1:25:07] tell me Church unto whom was the
[1:25:10] promises given the promises were given
[1:25:12] to the seed and Church of the Living God
[1:25:15] you are the literal spoken word seat
[1:25:18] right then the promises of the new
[1:25:20] Abraham has been given unto this bride
[1:25:22] and though she is in feminine
[1:25:24] designation she is also called the body
[1:25:27] of Christ it is very apparent that shall
[1:25:30] be called that now why because she was
[1:25:33] predestinated in him she came from the
[1:25:36] same Source was eternal with him and is
[1:25:39] now amen manifesting God in a
[1:25:43] many-membered body whereas once amen God
[1:25:46] was manifested in one member even our
[1:25:49] lord Jesus let me say this I say thank
[1:25:52] God for a prophet who came and stood in
[1:25:55] the face of Pentecostalism and preached
[1:25:57] the predestination of the Bible he
[1:26:00] preached the predestinated seed of all
[1:26:02] my God is in the heart of every bride
[1:26:06] member by the foreknowledge of God
[1:26:08] manifesting God in the fullness of his
[1:26:11] body in the fullness of his godhead you
[1:26:14] know I just said to you like this maybe
[1:26:16] just drop this into you amen I say thank
[1:26:18] God that we got a six-hour tape called
[1:26:21] spoken word is the Original Seed
[1:26:24] and if you go study that tape you're
[1:26:27] going to find that that is the first
[1:26:28] time from 47 to 65 that the prophet
[1:26:32] brings the two words together
[1:26:34] predestinated and Seed he'll say
[1:26:36] predestinated predestination he'll say
[1:26:39] seed for knowledge but in 1962 he brings
[1:26:43] the two together and then makes an
[1:26:45] identification and says and you are a
[1:26:47] predestinated seed amen just like Christ
[1:26:50] was somebody said well amen that's hard
[1:26:53] to preach well if you study spoken word
[1:26:55] it's the Original Seed he does say in
[1:26:58] the first half that the word is a seed
[1:27:00] in the first half of that sermon word
[1:27:03] seed but in the second half he begins to
[1:27:06] preach predestinated to receive the word
[1:27:08] see listen church amen the devil
[1:27:11] shouldn't be running you around like a
[1:27:13] hopeless helpless church member you
[1:27:15] ought to get some grit about you and
[1:27:17] recognize that you are a part of the
[1:27:20] seed of almighty God and there's a
[1:27:22] promise upon your life the spirit of God
[1:27:25] is here Amen to lead you into the full
[1:27:28] promise because you are worthy of it
[1:27:32] the spirit of God is here to lead you
[1:27:35] into the full promise because you're the
[1:27:38] only people on the face of the earth
[1:27:40] that is worthy to receive the fullness
[1:27:43] of the promise of God listen church as I
[1:27:46] was with Moses so will I be with thee
[1:27:49] see why Joshua had to take this command
[1:27:52] let God be with you as he was with Moses
[1:27:56] and will know that the same spirit that
[1:27:59] led us this far can take us on Amen I
[1:28:02] love I love that tape because I love how
[1:28:04] the prophet says with all the failures
[1:28:07] of Moses god stayed with him
[1:28:11] you won't talk about worthiness us about
[1:28:14] it brother Bob imagine being Joshua and
[1:28:17] realizing that the commission has now
[1:28:19] come upon your life to lead these people
[1:28:21] into the promised land that God promised
[1:28:24] Moses but Moses didn't take him there
[1:28:26] you've got to take him and imagine
[1:28:28] looking at yourself in the mirror like
[1:28:30] Joshua did and realizing all your
[1:28:33] failures and all your faults and how
[1:28:35] unworthy you are and how there's nothing
[1:28:37] worthy about you but then all of a
[1:28:39] sudden you begin to remember well Moses
[1:28:42] made mistakes but God stayed with him
[1:28:44] Moses failed but God stayed with him and

[1:28:50] heart that as I was with Moses so will I
[1:28:54] be with you well come on church amen if
[1:28:57] God was with the prophet he will also be

[1:31:05] when he said I saw you there oh Church
[1:31:08] of the Living God that tells me that a
[1:31:11] prophet saw a bride who was not worthy
[1:31:14] based on her own worthiness but she was
[1:31:17] made worthy based on the blood and she
[1:31:19] was seen in the land of promise
[1:31:22] thank you
[1:31:24] bring back the evidence of divine love
[1:31:26] and the power of Jesus Christ to make
[1:31:28] known to their congregations that there
[1:31:31] is a land beyond the river that's why
[1:31:34] we're not Kingdom Builders that's why
[1:31:36] we're not focused on us and here and
[1:31:38] what can be done for us we're trying to
[1:31:40] get you out of this Kingdom we're trying
[1:31:42] to get you listen this world is falling
[1:31:45] apart you gotta get somewhere where the
[1:31:48] city that has foundations you got to get
[1:31:50] somewhere where there's a place that
[1:31:52] time will not corrupt it that perversion
[1:31:55] will not corrupt it and there's only one
[1:31:57] place we can go that's to the New
[1:31:59] Jerusalem listen then God wants his seed
[1:32:03] to come in to the full value of the
[1:32:06] promised land now I tell you what the
[1:32:07] world wants the world wants mixers
[1:32:10] but you'll never as the seed of God
[1:32:12] takes the promise of God as a mixer
[1:32:15] because God wants separators see what
[1:32:19] does God do according to Deuteronomy 7
[1:32:21] God separates his people from the world
[1:32:24] to bring them into a complete identity
[1:32:27] as a believer in Deuteronomy 6 6 the
[1:32:30] Bible says Thou Art a holy people unto
[1:32:33] the Lord thy God the Lord that God has
[1:32:35] chosen thee to be a special people unto
[1:32:39] himself above all the people
[1:32:42] that are upon the face of the Earth the
[1:32:46] Lord did not set his love upon you Lord
[1:32:48] chose you because you were more in
[1:32:51] number than any people for ye were the
[1:32:53] fewest of all the people brother the
[1:32:55] most unworthy Bunch was the worth was
[1:32:58] the bunch who had been made worthy
[1:33:00] listen you're a chosen people now I'm
[1:33:03] about to borrow something from my pastor
[1:33:04] if that's okay amen I know sometimes
[1:33:06] that that preachers get up and because
[1:33:09] they don't study their okay well I might
[1:33:12] as well preach amen takes too much
[1:33:14] effort to study so they just get up
[1:33:16] because they don't want to study and say
[1:33:18] well I'm not a study or I'm not a
[1:33:19] revelation preacher I'm just going to
[1:33:21] preach my inspiration I'm just going to
[1:33:23] preach about whatever comes to mind well
[1:33:25] let me just say this we're not really
[1:33:27] interested in whatever comes to your
[1:33:28] mind we have a filter and it's the word
[1:33:31] of God it's the message of the hour
[1:33:33] [Applause]
[1:33:37] filter your mind to this message before
[1:33:40] you come the pulpit without anything to
[1:33:42] say
[1:33:43] oh God I'm gonna get in trouble sure but
[1:33:46] what happens brother brother Zach is
[1:33:48] they come to pulpit and they ain't got
[1:33:49] nothing to say and because they ain't
[1:33:51] got nothing to say nobody's saying amen
[1:33:53] and so because nobody's saying amen it
[1:33:56] turns from a sermon to a lashing and
[1:33:58] they begin to beat God's people because
[1:34:01] they're not hollering amen well we ain't
[1:34:03] going to say Amen when you ain't got
[1:34:04] nothing to say Amen to
[1:34:07] well I'm not a politician I'm a preacher
[1:34:10] if you want us to say Amen preach the
[1:34:12] message because we're Egos and that's
[1:34:14] the only thing we can say Amen to
[1:34:17] so when it turns into a lashing then all
[1:34:19] of a sudden message people become a
[1:34:22] bunch of stiff-necks 30 people you know
[1:34:24] they're too arrogant they're too haughty
[1:34:28] I'm gonna borrow your saying for my
[1:34:29] pastor quit beating up the message
[1:34:31] people and calling them arrogant and
[1:34:33] stiff-necked and haughty and stuck up no
[1:34:36] we're not arrogant we're not stiff neck
[1:34:38] we're not stuck up we're just not
[1:34:40] vulnerable no more
[1:34:43] say we used we used to be vulnerable
[1:34:45] soon and everything that comes through
[1:34:47] we followed it but but now we're found
[1:34:50] out by the preacher the message that we
[1:34:52] are worthy by the blood to believe the
[1:34:54] promise to the Seed of Abraham so we
[1:34:56] don't have to follow everybody's dream
[1:34:58] or follow everybody's Vision or so and
[1:35:01] so woke up and had a funny feeling do
[1:35:03] you realize how many how many how many
[1:35:05] funny feelings we have every day amen if
[1:35:08] we preach based on feelings amen he'd be
[1:35:10] up one day and down the next but this
[1:35:12] bride is not led by feelings she's not
[1:35:15] led by visions she's not led by dreams
[1:35:17] she's not led by words of knowledge and
[1:35:19] prophecies amen she's led by the saith
[1:35:22] the Lord through the face of Abraham by
[1:35:25] the message that restored Abraham's
[1:35:27] Faith to the Royal seat bride now we're
[1:35:30] not about your stuff people we're not
[1:35:32] about your starchy arrogant people we're
[1:35:34] just not vulnerable to everything that
[1:35:37] comes along
[1:35:40] well somebody shout amen out showed my
[1:35:43] knee or something
[1:35:45] we got an absolute we got a direction we
[1:35:48] got a Vindicated message and we're
[1:35:51] staking our lives on it because it's
[1:35:53] been Vindicated by God himself now you
[1:35:56] say preacher you're getting powerful am
[1:35:57] I really though because if you're going
[1:35:59] to come in the good land you're going to
[1:36:01] come in by God's provided way and the
[1:36:04] only way into the land is by Grace the
[1:36:06] problem of God said it'll take Grace to
[1:36:09] keep the family of Jehovah together now
[1:36:11] listen what is this message it's the
[1:36:14] message of Grace do you know what the
[1:36:16] Bible says the Bible says that we would
[1:36:18] not turn the grace of God
[1:36:20] into lasciviousness the Bible also says
[1:36:24] that we would not we would not move into
[1:36:26] Grace and then let sin abound do you see
[1:36:29] what this message is this message
[1:36:31] separated you from the denominational
[1:36:34] interpretation of Grace to give you an
[1:36:37] identity to be the real Lady of Grace
[1:36:39] according to the word of God you say
[1:36:41] preacher can you prove that well I can
[1:36:43] it's in the first seal in John the 12th
[1:36:46] chapter the prophet of God said now
[1:36:47] watch he said we're going to read John
[1:36:49] 12 and then you won't have to wonder no
[1:36:52] more what this thunder is amen don't you
[1:36:55] love that when a prophet says we're
[1:36:57] going to read it we're going to preach
[1:36:58] it and when we get done you ain't gonna
[1:37:01] have to wonder no more he reads John 12
[1:37:03] and says the hour has come that the son
[1:37:06] of man shall be glorified he said see
[1:37:08] you're at the end of an age here his
[1:37:10] ministry is ending so when you come to
[1:37:13] the end you got to do something you got
[1:37:15] to go somewhere you can't just stay at
[1:37:18] the end see now watch the hour has come
[1:37:21] that the son of man shall be glorified
[1:37:23] he said what about the Hours come that
[1:37:25] the bride must be taken away
[1:37:27] oh that's preaching material right there
[1:37:30] when you come to the end it's the hour
[1:37:32] that the bride must be taken away he
[1:37:35] said what about the Hours come but time
[1:37:38] shall be no more he said the angel is
[1:37:40] ready to set one foot on land and the
[1:37:42] other on sea where the rainbow over his
[1:37:44] head with his feet and say time has run
[1:37:47] out and besides that he has raised up
[1:37:50] his hand and swore that time would be no
[1:37:52] more when this happened how perfect it
[1:37:56] is it's a sworn affidavit to the church
[1:37:59] oh my when this seal is broke he said
[1:38:02] now when the lamb took the book and
[1:38:03] broke the first seal amen God spoke from
[1:38:06] his eternal Throne to say what the
[1:38:09] symbol was to be revealed so its symbol
[1:38:12] and then it goes to revealed right when
[1:38:14] it's placed before John it was in a
[1:38:16] symbol when John saw it was still a
[1:38:18] mystery why it wasn't even revealed man
[1:38:20] because it cannot be revealed until what
[1:38:23] he said here at the end time listen the
[1:38:26] symbol cannot be revealed until there's
[1:38:28] a people on the Earth that's been found
[1:38:30] worthy to receive the revelation of the
[1:38:33] seal that's been revealed it oh God help
[1:38:36] me Lord Jesus if the lamb had to be
[1:38:39] worthy if the only one that could take
[1:38:41] the book and loosed to seals had to be
[1:38:43] film worthy then you better believe the
[1:38:45] people that would receive what the lamb
[1:38:48] was revealing had to be found worthy too
[1:38:50] and the whole God and the same lamb who
[1:38:53] opened the seals is the same lamb that
[1:38:56] bled and died for you to put you in
[1:38:59] position to make you worthy to receive
[1:39:02] the revelation of the entire Mysteries
[1:39:04] of the Bible in the age that you're
[1:39:06] living in
[1:39:07] I'm about to explode up here I'm not
[1:39:10] talking about psychology I'm not talking
[1:39:12] about education I'm talking about the
[1:39:15] blood that's made you Worthy
[1:39:20] the blood has made you worthy to receive
[1:39:23] the revelation of the word in the age
[1:39:27] you're living time is run out church we
[1:39:30] cannot stay here brother Aaron we gotta
[1:39:33] go somewhere so the Lamb made us worthy
[1:39:36] to receive the revelation of the word of
[1:39:38] God to put us into Rapture condition
[1:39:41] who brother when that Thunder when that
[1:39:45] Thunder thundered he said remember a
[1:39:47] loud clapping noise of a thunderous the
[1:39:49] voice of God somebody says well let's
[1:39:51] break the Thunders down no let's say
[1:39:52] what a prophet said it's the voice of
[1:39:54] God
[1:39:57] well you say preacher you're dumb you're
[1:39:59] exactly right I'm dumb enough to say
[1:40:00] what a prophet said
[1:40:03] what the Bible said it's a clap of
[1:40:06] Thunder they thought it was a thunder
[1:40:07] but it was God he understood it for it
[1:40:11] was revealed to him see it was a thunder
[1:40:13] and notice the first seal when it was
[1:40:16] opened in December form it thundered now
[1:40:19] what happened when it's open in its
[1:40:21] reality form it thundered in its symbol
[1:40:24] form then it'll be open in its reality
[1:40:26] form Church of the Living God if it
[1:40:29] thundered in its symbol form it's going
[1:40:31] to thunder in its reality form and God
[1:40:34] sent a prophet to Jeffersonville to
[1:40:36] speak over that church and say what we
[1:40:39] need is a thousand live voices Amen to
[1:40:42] thunder out amen the life of Jesus
[1:40:45] Christ
[1:40:47] church I'm telling you this morning it's
[1:40:49] time to go home it's time to quit
[1:40:51] looking for something it's time to
[1:40:53] recognize what has been released and
[1:40:55] revealed and put in your possession to
[1:40:58] take you out of this age into the
[1:41:00] Millennium of Jesus Christ it thundered
[1:41:03] as soon as the lamb struck back that
[1:41:04] seal and what did it reveal now watch
[1:41:06] this not all of itself first is with God
[1:41:09] next it's in symbol then it's revealed
[1:41:12] three things it comes from God to symbol
[1:41:16] to revelation
[1:41:19] comes from God to symbol to Revelation
[1:41:22] product God said from Revelation to
[1:41:24] reality
[1:41:26] now come on it's coming forth from the
[1:41:28] throne it cannot be seen
[1:41:31] it cannot be heard or nothing it's
[1:41:34] sealed up the Lamb's blood paid the
[1:41:36] price it thundered when he spoke it out
[1:41:39] and when he did a white horse rider
[1:41:41] started out see and it still was a
[1:41:45] symbol it still was a symbol now watch
[1:41:49] this from God to symbol to Revelation
[1:41:53] Revelation brings it to reality from God
[1:41:57] to symbol to Revelation Revelation
[1:42:00] brings you to reality now watch he said
[1:42:03] it would be known in the last day but it
[1:42:04] comes forth in a church symbol do you
[1:42:06] understand it Church come forth in a
[1:42:08] symbol of a church that they know
[1:42:10] there's a seal but just what it is yet
[1:42:12] they don't know because it's a white
[1:42:14] horse rider and it's only to be revealed
[1:42:17] at the last day when this axle seal is
[1:42:20] broken to who not to Christ but to the
[1:42:23] church come on God is known to seal all
[1:42:26] along but when John saw the symbol of it
[1:42:29] he did not receive the revelation of it
[1:42:31] although when God showed him the symbol
[1:42:33] is this okay when God showed him the
[1:42:36] symbol amen he already had the
[1:42:38] Revelation in the back part of his mind
[1:42:40] when he give John the symbol of a white
[1:42:43] horse rider when John wrote it he wrote
[1:42:45] it under symbol but in 1963 when a
[1:42:48] prophet stood behind the pulpit he had
[1:42:51] been in the back part of God's mind and
[1:42:53] the mind of God was in the prophet of
[1:42:55] God and he's no longer preaching symbols
[1:42:57] he's no longer just preaching it's a
[1:42:59] white horse rider and that white horse
[1:43:01] riders cries he has now picked up the
[1:43:04] reality of the revelation of the symbol
[1:43:06] and he's putting a bride in position to
[1:43:09] whip that devil
[1:43:12] Hallelujah Church you may think I'm
[1:43:14] crazy but at least I'm free you have
[1:43:17] been put in position to whip the Devils

[1:43:28] message lift up your head this message
[1:43:31] has finally put a youth in the position
[1:43:33] to defeat the Devil
[1:43:35] [Applause]
[1:43:37] this message ain't just some book or
[1:43:39] tape this ain't just some little shout
[1:43:41] hallelujah Camp time this is the power
[1:43:43] of God and the Salvation it's a
[1:43:45] revelation to whip two hundred thousand
[1:43:47] thousand devils
[1:43:53] God had the Revelation all along John
[1:43:56] received it in symbol but William
[1:43:57] Branham preached the revelation of it
[1:44:01] can I preach to you now but before he
[1:44:04] preached the Revelation he changed your
[1:44:06] identity amen I don't know if you can
[1:44:08] give me any more in my ear but I'd
[1:44:09] appreciate it amen before before
[1:44:13] he preached it he had to receive the
[1:44:17] revelation of it but before he give you
[1:44:19] the revelation of it he changed your
[1:44:21] identity changed our identity by the way
[1:44:23] yes he said I hope you catch this I'm
[1:44:27] going to call you Brad
[1:44:29] I'm going to call you bruh I'm no longer
[1:44:33] going to call you church I'm going to
[1:44:35] call you Brad so that you'll understand
[1:44:39] so he was not just calling you bride to
[1:44:42] make you all puffed up well I'm the
[1:44:44] bride I'm the bride he was calling you
[1:44:46] the bride show the understanding of the
[1:44:49] revelation of the word of God could rest
[1:44:52] upon your life and you would be made
[1:44:54] worthy by the revelation
[1:44:57] I'm on church and then a prophet stood
[1:44:59] there and set the first seal is the
[1:45:01] white horse rider and he said the white
[1:45:03] horse rider is none other than the devil
[1:45:05] which is the Antichrist and he said now
[1:45:08] we all know as Christians that God swore
[1:45:11] to David that he would raise up Christ
[1:45:13] to sit on his throne and give him an
[1:45:16] everlasting kingdom here on the earth he
[1:45:18] did it and Jesus said he that overcomes
[1:45:22] the Antichrist and all it's okay and all
[1:45:25] the things of the world shall set with
[1:45:27] me on my throne even as I overcome and
[1:45:31] have set down on my father's Throne do

[1:46:05] somebody shout hallelujah I'm about to
[1:46:08] explode right now we're not going to be

[1:46:49] revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:46:51] we're going to overcome the Revelation
[1:46:53] overcome the Antichrist by the
[1:46:56] revelation of Jesus Christ it's a
[1:47:00] revelation of God that will give you
[1:47:02] authority over the devil it's the
[1:47:04] revelation of God that will give you
[1:47:07] authority over the devil and you can see
[1:47:09] why they who would add or take away from
[1:47:11] this word would be cursed would have to
[1:47:13] be for who can add or take away
[1:47:16] are you ready for this from the perfect
[1:47:18] revelation
[1:47:21] it's not an imperfect revelation
[1:47:24] it's a perfect revelation of God and
[1:47:28] overcome the enemy you cannot oh God you
[1:47:32] cannot tamper with the revelation of
[1:47:35] Jesus Christ and overcome the Antichrist
[1:47:38] you cannot sit down and run it through
[1:47:41] the halls of the Baptist Seminary and
[1:47:43] the halls of the Pentecostal Seminary
[1:47:45] when you run it through those seminaries
[1:47:47] you are diluting the perfect Revelation
[1:47:49] with a with a water of denomination and
[1:47:52] I say God forbid that we ever lay this
[1:47:55] message on the table of denomination and
[1:47:58] subject this message to what some
[1:47:59] Baptist taught or some idea of the
[1:48:02] Catholic we are the Bride of Jesus
[1:48:04] Christ and this message is the perfect
[1:48:07] Superior Revelation above all that the
[1:48:10] world has can I say it like the prophet
[1:48:13] said he said there is no such Force
[1:48:15] there is no such prevailing power as the
[1:48:19] revelation of the word man running from
[1:48:21] the presence of the Lord he sent many
[1:48:23] here tonight Lord will be here here
[1:48:24] that's confused on those subjects that's
[1:48:26] vital oh God open that fountain in the
[1:48:30] house of God that's for cleansing us I
[1:48:32] pray God that you'll wash us and cleanse
[1:48:35] Us in thy blood and make us new
[1:48:37] creatures are you ready for this and
[1:48:39] give us Grace
[1:48:42] and give us Grace and strength to bring
[1:48:46] forth the word of Truth in its divine
[1:48:50] revelation of the being of Jesus Christ
[1:48:54] that's a mouthful right there we got to
[1:48:56] have Grace Church and we're going to
[1:48:58] have strength to bring forth the divine
[1:49:01] revelation of the being of Jesus Christ
[1:49:04] I don't have time to preach on it but
[1:49:06] let me just give you a few seconds of it
[1:49:07] this message is the Revival of the
[1:49:11] Supreme deity of Jesus Christ in the
[1:49:14] church
[1:49:15] this message is not the Revival of
[1:49:18] brother Branham it's not the Revival of
[1:49:20] Jeffersonville this message is the
[1:49:23] Revival of the Supreme deity of Jesus
[1:49:26] Christ where can you find the Supreme
[1:49:28] deity of Jesus Christ in the Bible you
[1:49:31] can find in Revelation 1 verse 8 when he
[1:49:33] said I am the Alpha and the Omega I am
[1:49:36] the first and the last I am he that was
[1:49:38] and he is and shall be he says what is
[1:49:41] that that's the greatest of all
[1:49:43] Revelations is the Supreme deity of
[1:49:47] Jesus Christ then he goes from
[1:49:48] Revelation 1 8 to Revelation 3 8 and
[1:49:51] says there'll be an Open Door
[1:49:54] what is the open door it's the
[1:49:56] revelation of the Supreme deity of Jesus
[1:49:59] Christ made manifest In the Flesh of the
[1:50:03] bride and the Bible says Upon This Rock
[1:50:05] I will build my church and the Gates of
[1:50:08] Hell shall not Prevail against it Spoken
[1:50:10] Word Church I'm preaching to you this
[1:50:12] morning the Devil May throw a lot
[1:50:14] against you the devil may throw a lot
[1:50:16] against this ministry but you have been
[1:50:18] Anointed with the revelation of the
[1:50:21] Supreme deity of Jesus Christ then what
[1:50:23] did my challenge you to do get up off
[1:50:25] your pity party get up off your ass Heap
[1:50:28] and get on the horse of the word and get
[1:50:31] a sword in your hand and ride that devil
[1:50:33] down and defeat that Devil by the
[1:50:36] revelation of the word of God
[1:50:39] not a crazy man I've been anointed by
[1:50:42] the grace of God to bring forth
[1:50:44] to bring forth come on Brother come on
[1:50:47] sister you know what bring him forth
[1:50:49] means it's speaking of birth
[1:50:55] I feel good bringing forth is speaking
[1:50:58] of birth now if you go to the book of
[1:51:00] Isaiah 37 the Bible said the day is a
[1:51:03] day of trouble psalms 27 says it'll be a
[1:51:06] day in a day of trouble in a time of
[1:51:09] trouble is the background for the
[1:51:11] Rapture he said unto they have trouble
[1:51:13] of rebuke of blasphemy for the children
[1:51:16] are come to the birth and there's not
[1:51:19] strengths to bring forth the children
[1:51:22] the seed has come to the birth but
[1:51:26] there's no strength to bring forth John
[1:51:28] 16 20 verily verily I say unto you that
[1:51:31] ye shall weep and lament but the world
[1:51:34] shall rejoice ye shall be sorrowful but
[1:51:37] your sorrow shall be turned into Joy a
[1:51:40] woman when she is in travail has sorrow
[1:51:43] because her hour is come oh
[1:51:47] I wish I was a preacher right now The
[1:51:49] Hours come John 12 Revelation 1 3 the
[1:51:52] time is at hand are you hearing me and
[1:51:55] right here Jesus says when The Hours
[1:51:57] come amen as soon as she has delivered
[1:52:00] to the child she remembersth no more of
[1:52:03] the anguish for joy that a man is born
[1:52:06] in the world and ye now therefore have
[1:52:09] sorrow but I will see you again and your
[1:52:13] heart shall rejoice and your joy no man
[1:52:16] taketh from you brother band preaches an
[1:52:19] entire sermon from that scripture and
[1:52:21] calls it birth pains he says now I
[1:52:24] believe that Jesus here was speaking of
[1:52:25] you will have sorrow but your sorrow
[1:52:28] shall be turned to Joy speaking to his
[1:52:31] disciples here knowing that the birth of
[1:52:33] Christianity was coming into existence
[1:52:36] now can I preach to you the old has to
[1:52:39] die in order that the new is born to
[1:52:42] have anything that gives birth has to
[1:52:44] have Pains of distress and they
[1:52:46] certainly was going to go through the
[1:52:48] pain of distress and anguish to get away
[1:52:51] from the law unto Grace So this birth is
[1:52:55] birthing us out of the law which makes
[1:52:57] you unworthy into the grace of God
[1:53:01] come on if you try to live by law you
[1:53:04] won't ever come to church if you try to
[1:53:06] live by law you won't ever raise your
[1:53:08] hands you won't ever enjoy the presence
[1:53:10] of God but if you ever get underneath a
[1:53:12] spout where the glory of the grace of
[1:53:14] God Is Us right now you will move amen
[1:53:17] from the legalistic bondage of law into
[1:53:20] the message of Grace and you will walk
[1:53:22] with favor you will walk with anointing
[1:53:25] you will walk with a power upon your
[1:53:27] life that you know I'm unworthy by the
[1:53:29] law but is Grace
[1:53:32] his grace among Church his grace has
[1:53:36] made do you realize we ought to be
[1:53:38] brothers act sitting in a Baptist church
[1:53:39] this morning preaching that the
[1:53:41] Antichrist or rather the white horse
[1:53:43] rider is Christ but Grace made a place
[1:53:46] in the body of Jesus Christ underneath
[1:53:50] the headstone Ministry of cerebral Amen
[1:53:53] to put a bride in position to walk
[1:53:56] [Music]
[1:53:57] if I'm on church quit reading about it
[1:54:00] and start walking in it start walking in
[1:54:02] the revelation of the son of man start
[1:54:05] walking in the revelation of the seventh
[1:54:08] seal start walking in the blessing of
[1:54:10] the third pool
[1:54:12] when brother Brandon preaches is he's
[1:54:14] tapping a natural birth with a spiritual
[1:54:16] birth and he said now a genuine New
[1:54:18] Birth will not produce a steel birth he
[1:54:21] said now watch what's going to happen is
[1:54:23] the old must die in order to bring forth
[1:54:26] the new that's the same thing with the
[1:54:28] new birth we never go back we go forward
[1:54:31] when you're born again he said genuine
[1:54:34] New Birth is because the seed is well
[1:54:37] maybe will sympathize with the word or
[1:54:39] the person but they don't want to rot
[1:54:41] away
[1:54:43] from that Old system that they were in
[1:54:46] can I have a few more minutes now watch
[1:54:49] this he said they still want to cling on
[1:54:51] to it
[1:54:53] but they knew the old system is dead but
[1:54:56] they just don't want to go out of it see
[1:54:58] now rot is when it's really done away
[1:55:01] with when a claim is made that they are
[1:55:04] newborn but a claim is only a begotten
[1:55:07] sign see rotten brings forth a new New
[1:55:10] Birth you've got to run away from it
[1:55:12] just as we did in all ages to the west
[1:55:14] and all fourth now watch them will drop
[1:55:16] down they had to come out of it run away
[1:55:19] from it to accept the new birth if they
[1:55:22] were going to be found worthy of the
[1:55:24] full promise of God they had to they did
[1:55:27] not just have to acknowledge the old was
[1:55:29] dead but they had to have strength to be
[1:55:31] pushed out of the old into the new they
[1:55:34] had to come out of it somebody say out
[1:55:36] of it rot away from it to accept the new
[1:55:40] birth now come on church because the
[1:55:43] prophet of God teaches you what the new
[1:55:45] birth is in Christ the mystery he said
[1:55:48] what is the new birth in you say well
[1:55:49] brother Branham it is the revelation of
[1:55:52] Jesus Christ personally to you Christ in
[1:55:57] you makes him the center of the life of
[1:55:59] the Revelation then can I say this you
[1:56:02] are the walk and talk and breathe and
[1:56:04] live and manifested revelation of the
[1:56:07] opening of the word in the age that
[1:56:09] you're living in what is it is Christ
[1:56:11] the Bible he is the word and was
[1:56:14] revealed to you and no matter what
[1:56:16] anybody says what takes place it's
[1:56:19] Christ Pastor priest whatever it might
[1:56:22] be it's Christ in you that is the
[1:56:25] Revelation that the church was built
[1:56:28] upon listen Church Without this message
[1:56:30] brother Bob we did not even have a clear
[1:56:33] biblical understanding of what the new
[1:56:35] birth is but when a Prophet come on the
[1:56:37] scene he began to declare New Birth it's
[1:56:40] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:56:42] personally to you now I'm going
[1:56:45] somewhere because he says it very
[1:56:46] beautiful in the church age book he said
[1:56:48] we did not become seed by the rebirth we
[1:56:51] were seed and therefore were reborn for
[1:56:54] only the elect can be reborn because we
[1:56:57] were seen is the reason we could be
[1:56:59] quickened in non-seed there's nothing to
[1:57:02] click without a king seed of almighty
[1:57:05] God you are unworthy you are unthought
[1:57:08] of you are pushed out of the economy of
[1:57:10] God when it comes to Rapture but if
[1:57:12] there's a seed in your soul well I feel
[1:57:15] like shouting right now if there's a
[1:57:17] seed in your soul your body may be
[1:57:20] against you but it's not greater than
[1:57:23] the seed that's in you that seed has
[1:57:25] brought your body subject to the birth
[1:57:28] of the Rapture it'll change this body in
[1:57:32] the moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:57:34] what are you saying preacher I'm saying
[1:57:36] the seed goes on the seed don't stay in
[1:57:39] the old it goes on see the seed goes
[1:57:43] forward
[1:57:45] can I preach to you the seed goes
[1:57:47] forward Moses could not have brought
[1:57:49] Noah's message neither could Jesus
[1:57:51] brought Noah's message because it was
[1:57:53] another age and the old seed was right
[1:57:57] come on don't don't get in your mind and
[1:57:59] we're just knocking lutherans and
[1:58:01] knocking wastelands and knocking
[1:58:03] Pentecostals the seed was right the old
[1:58:06] seed was right brother but the prophet
[1:58:08] said it served its purpose and was dead
[1:58:11] and gone on the transformation from the
[1:58:14] old to the new now do you know why you
[1:58:17] got to transfer from the old to the new
[1:58:19] you've got to be where the life come on
[1:58:22] now where the life was at was what was
[1:58:25] worrying the people is what worries them
[1:58:27] yet today now come on if your weird life
[1:58:30] is and there's an anointing brother Bob
[1:58:33] to birth and move forward there's always
[1:58:35] an element of insecurity or Scare
[1:58:37] because you know there's life there
[1:58:40] come on remember I'm talking about a
[1:58:43] baby he said that baby has gotten so
[1:58:44] used to that womb he said he's got meals
[1:58:47] a day warm comfort of a mother that he's
[1:58:49] almost worried he's almost scared to
[1:58:52] leave the womb but if he's ever going to
[1:58:54] live if he's ever going to manifest the
[1:58:56] full potentials of a human being he's
[1:58:59] got to leave the womb
[1:59:02] he's going to leave the womb and he's
[1:59:04] going to move to where life was not at
[1:59:06] but where life is come on church can I
[1:59:09] say this as plain as I know how we
[1:59:11] cannot we cannot we cannot stay where
[1:59:14] life was we must advance to where life
[1:59:19] is
[1:59:21] now I got a message for it I've got the
[1:59:24] countdown the horse and buggy made way
[1:59:27] for the automobile and the automobile
[1:59:28] made way for the airplane and the
[1:59:30] airplane made way for the astronaut come
[1:59:33] on do you realize what happens though
[1:59:35] when one steps out of the familiar into
[1:59:38] the new amen they automatically become
[1:59:40] an oddball so because nobody wants to be
[1:59:43] a spectacle nobody wants to be an
[1:59:45] oddball they try to stay where the old
[1:59:47] was
[1:59:49] and they die
[1:59:52] because the life is moving now come on
[1:59:54] y'all go to Amish country no offense to
[1:59:55] our Amish friends but y'all go to Amish
[1:59:57] country and they're still riding horse
[1:59:59] and Buggies
[2:00:01] come on and you talk to the people and
[2:00:04] there's all kinds of accidents and
[2:00:06] there's all and there's all kinds of
[2:00:07] deaths every year because they're
[2:00:10] they're competing with Speedways and
[2:00:12] highways of 90 miles an hour in a horse
[2:00:15] and buggy that only preached the just
[2:00:17] shall live by faith
[2:00:19] well come on amen that's why they quit
[2:00:22] going to meetings because they're still
[2:00:23] hung up and God sent a prophet but
[2:00:25] there's a bride who has moved into the
[2:00:28] revelation of what a prophet taught and
[2:00:30] so because we're not still sitting
[2:00:32] around the campfire telling stories when
[2:00:34] brother Branham was hunting and all of a
[2:00:36] sudden we're not spiritual no we are the
[2:00:38] spiritual Israel because we have
[2:00:40] advanced come on Church what God did to
[2:00:43] Abraham he did to his seed after him
[2:00:47] this bride is not staying in 1906 she's
[2:00:51] not staying and God sent a prophet she's
[2:00:53] not staying and hunting stories she's
[2:00:55] not standing brother Brandon was my
[2:00:57] buddy she has moved into the revelation
[2:00:59] of the manifestation of her complete
[2:01:02] identity in Jesus Christ the churches
[2:01:04] have got so systematic he said so
[2:01:06] they're afraid they're afraid to become
[2:01:08] an oddball he said but those who Advance
[2:01:11] will automatically I'm paraphrasing
[2:01:13] automatically become odd to the previous
[2:01:16] until it's accepted
[2:01:19] hahaha now that now that's where you got
[2:01:21] to stand and I want to say I I just want
[2:01:23] to take this opportunity this morning to
[2:01:25] say God bless our brother Dale
[2:01:28] God bless our brother Sam Dale
[2:01:31] God bless our brother Ed biscals God
[2:01:34] bless our men of God God bless these God

[2:01:37] generation amen that had to advance amen
[2:01:40] out of friendships and out of circles to
[2:01:43] stand and declare that there's more to
[2:01:45] this thing than just wearing a belt
[2:01:47] buckle there's more to this thing than
[2:01:49] just carrying a briefcase there's a
[2:01:52] laugh there's a power there's an
[2:01:54] anointing there's a not in the tire
[2:01:56] behind this message so what did they do
[2:01:58] they had to bring forth they had to step
[2:02:00] out and they had to stand there and be
[2:02:02] made fun of and laughed at ridiculed and
[2:02:04] well they're just trying to beat
[2:02:05] something and they're just trying to
[2:02:07] teach something more than somebody else
[2:02:08] they're just trying to be a theologian
[2:02:10] no they're trying to bring a people to
[2:02:13] the knowledge that they're not going to
[2:02:14] get worthy they're already Worthy
[2:02:20] it's all odd till it's accepted
[2:02:23] then when it's accepted everybody blazes
[2:02:25] the trail you know

[2:03:41] I gotta listen to enough tapes I gotta
[2:03:44] read enough books I gotta attend enough
[2:03:45] meetings you gotta recognize that he has
[2:03:49] made you Worthy
[2:03:51] brother said it very plain he says now
[2:03:53] watch in this last day paraphrasing in
[2:03:55] this last day he said fear not little
[2:03:57] flock there's only there's only going to
[2:03:59] be a few but it's your father's good
[2:04:01] pleasure to give you the kingdom
[2:04:03] now watch this the program of God will
[2:04:06] always be in the minority are you with
[2:04:08] me on that point but in this program in
[2:04:11] 1959 in this faith that we're now
[2:04:13] preaching and earnestly contending for
[2:04:16] don't you move one inch from it for if
[2:04:20] you believe me to be his servant this is
[2:04:22] the program of God it'll never be in the
[2:04:25] majority it'll always be in the minority
[2:04:28] always has and always will be but
[2:04:31] remember fear not little flock it's your
[2:04:33] father's Good Will to give you the
[2:04:35] kingdom then what are you saying
[2:04:36] preacher I'm saying the minority is
[2:04:38] going to be an elected few who have been
[2:04:40] predestinated unto adoption come on
[2:04:43] Church they've been predestinated to be
[2:04:45] more than just born
[2:04:47] they've been predestinated to take a
[2:04:50] position see and God has identified the
[2:04:52] people who is worthy of the full promise
[2:04:54] now let me say it to you like this can I
[2:04:56] can I have just a few more minutes be
[2:04:58] elect of each age that pressures the
[2:04:59] battle the elect seed from the beginning
[2:05:01] until now moves closer and closer to the
[2:05:04] fullness until finally they are the
[2:05:06] fullness Jesus says Revelation 3 4 he
[2:05:09] said thou Hast a few names which are
[2:05:11] people even Sardis which have not
[2:05:13] defiled their garments and they shall
[2:05:15] walk with me in white for they are
[2:05:18] worthy they are worthy now the prophet
[2:05:20] of God says these people were the true
[2:05:22] saints of God we're walking all pleasing
[2:05:24] unto the Lord their garments were clean
[2:05:27] you see in those days the garments would
[2:05:28] sleep along the road and pick up the
[2:05:30] dirt and defilement these were watching
[2:05:32] how they walked so that they were not
[2:05:34] corrupted by the world they were in the
[2:05:37] spirit and walk in the spirit they were
[2:05:39] holy and Without Blame before him thus
[2:05:41] they were fulfilling their purpose for
[2:05:43] what is what Ephesians 1 4 says is the
[2:05:46] purpose of God for us that we should to
[2:05:48] be holy and Without Blame if they were
[2:05:50] willing to walk with him through tolls
[2:05:52] and snares of life and be an honor to
[2:05:54] him he was going to reward them listen
[2:05:57] church and now Jesus stands there and
[2:06:00] says these words for they are worthy I
[2:06:03] know what you're saying you're saying
[2:06:05] that's just sardisian church age brother
[2:06:06] Andrew I'm not a part of that but do you
[2:06:09] realize that how can overcome the
[2:06:10] prophet of God said the last Church age
[2:06:12] gets all the rewards plus the reward of
[2:06:15] their age so in this last Church age you
[2:06:18] get the blessing of oh God
[2:06:21] he says they are worthy do you realize
[2:06:23] who is saying this it is Jesus the
[2:06:26] worthy one only himself this is the only
[2:06:29] one who is accounted worthy to take the
[2:06:31] book out of the hand of him who sits
[2:06:34] upon the throne and now this worthy one
[2:06:37] is saying to his Saints you are worthy
[2:06:40] the worthy one when they search the
[2:06:43] heavens brothers act they search the
[2:06:45] Earth they searched underneath the Earth
[2:06:47] and could not find one worthy but then
[2:06:50] the lamb comes forth and he was found
[2:06:52] worthy and he took the book and he broke
[2:06:55] in the seals and he released it to the
[2:06:57] center of Angel and the seventh angel
[2:06:58] priesthood to the bride and now the same
[2:07:01] one who opened the book is now turning
[2:07:03] to the ones who are eating the book who
[2:07:05] are possessing the promises and says you
[2:07:08] are worthy you are worthy here is this
[2:07:12] one the only one qualified to judge and
[2:07:15] indeed all judgment is committed to him
[2:07:18] and he says
[2:07:21] brother Michael he says he says you are
[2:07:26] worthy
[2:07:30] brother Bob he says hey
[2:07:33] Brother Anderson so I don't care what
[2:07:35] they said he says
[2:07:40] sister June you're not worthy so-and-so
[2:07:42] said don't care what they said he said
[2:07:44] come on church I feel like preaching I
[2:07:47] think it's time to take what he said and
[2:07:49] punch that devil right Square in the
[2:07:51] face
[2:07:53] I don't care what you're saying I don't
[2:07:55] care what your buddy said I don't care
[2:07:57] what your friend says I only care about
[2:07:59] what's the one who is worthy to say
[2:08:01] something and he said he said he said I
[2:08:05] am worthy who shall lay anything then to
[2:08:09] the charge of God's elect it is God that
[2:08:12] justifies but remember said these words
[2:08:14] are astounding as are the words in
[2:08:15] Romans 8 33 God says I am righteous way
[2:08:19] translation there in the white light oh
[2:08:21] God that's a powerful point in the
[2:08:23] brother Wayne right there in the white
[2:08:25] light of God's righteousness hear the
[2:08:28] sweet voice of Jesus as he says these
[2:08:32] are mine they are righteous they are
[2:08:36] worthy and they shall walk with me in
[2:08:39] white
[2:08:40] I don't have time to get into it but
[2:08:42] I'll just give you a quick reference of
[2:08:44] it Matthew 24 Luke 21 gives two separate
[2:08:47] accounts right of Jesus prophecy
[2:08:49] concerning the end time in there you'll
[2:08:51] find that Israel is represented as the
[2:08:54] symbolic fig tree you will find the
[2:08:56] Matthew 24 Jesus was asked three
[2:08:58] questions in Matthew 24 verse 2 write
[2:09:01] the scripture down read them later
[2:09:02] Matthew 24 2 Jesus is speaking here of
[2:09:06] the destruction of Jerusalem and in
[2:09:08] Matthew 24 14 and 15 he speaks of the
[2:09:11] Abomination y'all are well taught that
[2:09:13] cause desolation which you know what
[2:09:15] that was it was the rejection of the
[2:09:17] Messiah and from that time from that
[2:09:19] time there has never been a more
[2:09:22] persecuted people than the Jewish race
[2:09:24] but you come down the 21st verse for
[2:09:26] then shall be Great Tribulation such as
[2:09:28] was not since the beginning of the world
[2:09:30] to this time no nor even nor ever shall
[2:09:33] be verse 22 and accept those days shall
[2:09:36] be shortened there should be no flesh
[2:09:38] saith but for the elect's sake for for
[2:09:41] the elect's sake those days shall be
[2:09:44] shortened listen Church the Jews have
[2:09:47] been a persecuted people for the past
[2:09:49] two thousand years because of their
[2:09:51] rejection of the Messiah for the elect's
[2:09:54] sake he's speaking of the 144 000 which
[2:09:56] Revelation 11 right the two prophets
[2:09:58] will go back to the hundred forty four
[2:10:00] thousand and then they will come under
[2:10:02] they will come back under amen the power
[2:10:05] of redemption this Jewish tribulation
[2:10:07] that has been upon the Jews is different
[2:10:09] from the tribulation it'll be sent down
[2:10:12] from God upon the Earth that will be the
[2:10:14] wrath of God but you move from Matthew
[2:10:16] 24 and you go to Luke 21 verse 36 in
[2:10:19] church this is my this is my closing
[2:10:21] point my shouting point right out of

[2:10:31] accounted worthy to escape all these
[2:10:34] things that shall come to pass and to
[2:10:37] stand before the son of man oh church if
[2:10:41] you are a part of that Gene seed of God
[2:10:44] if you're a part of the Plan of
[2:10:46] Redemption if your name is in the Lamb's
[2:10:49] Book of Life who the lamb alone was
[2:10:51] worthy to reveal if your name is in that
[2:10:54] book then the same lamb who ripped off
[2:10:57] the seals is the same lamb who broke the
[2:11:00] sin and trespass that was dictating your

[2:22:20] worthy not to be deceived
[2:22:22] worthy to walk in the Revelation y'all I
[2:22:26] share this with you and I'll turn it
[2:22:27] over to brother Wade y'all probably
[2:22:28] remember some of you I was actually back
[2:22:29] before I was even born so I know some of
[2:22:31] you would remember in 1993 the Waco
[2:22:33] Texas uh Siege there the David koresh
[2:22:37] the whole uh Branch Davidians things
[2:22:41] government whatever we're not going into
[2:22:42] all that but the other day we was on our
[2:22:44] way down there we met brother Timothy
[2:22:46] Pruitt and his wife and daughter out
[2:22:47] there and spent a few days and on the
[2:22:49] way down there I'd always heard brother
[2:22:50] Sean preach you know and he'd mentioned
[2:22:52] he'd say we ain't falling to Jim Jones
[2:22:54] or David correction I never even looking
[2:22:56] at guys I looked him up got to watch a
[2:22:58] little bit of documentary on him he's
[2:23:00] riding down the road I was listening to
[2:23:01] it and and while I'm listening to it
[2:23:03] brother Bobby something just jumped out
[2:23:04] at me it said he believed he was the
[2:23:07] Lamb of Revelation 5 that was worthy to
[2:23:10] open the seals
[2:23:12] my wife's probably got a little man in
[2:23:14] the nursery but now she is asleep
[2:23:15] ran down the road and I woke her up and
[2:23:16] I said you ain't gonna believe what this
[2:23:18] guy
[2:23:19] so we get down there and I told Timothy
[2:23:21] if he's listening God bless you he said
[2:23:23] I don't want to go over that's that's
[2:23:24] strange well let's go over let's just
[2:23:26] let's just go see it you know so we go
[2:23:28] over spirit I mean you literally feel
[2:23:30] the spirits hanging around the place we
[2:23:32] walk in the church the only thing left
[2:23:33] of all the compound everything burnt
[2:23:35] down they build a little churches and
[2:23:37] museums we walked in there and there's a
[2:23:39] guy standing behind there and he goes oh
[2:23:41] uh are you all of any religious
[2:23:42] background and brother Timothy said yeah
[2:23:44] he looked at me and I said yeah he said
[2:23:46] oh what background I said well we're
[2:23:47] non-denominational you know I just want
[2:23:48] to throw it out there and see where we
[2:23:50] went well I found out right quick that
[2:23:52] just because we had a little bit of
[2:23:54] religious background he was ready to
[2:23:55] talk I mean you ever met them guys that
[2:23:58] talk and you can't get a word in
[2:23:59] edgewise I mean that
[2:24:01] he is telling us more we wanted to know
[2:24:03] you know so he finally got done I said
[2:24:05] well I said okay acid you shared with me
[2:24:07] what you believed I said well we believe
[2:24:09] in a prophet his eyes got big I said we
[2:24:11] ever heard of a man named William Brown
[2:24:13] no I never heard of him I told him some
[2:24:14] history I said well we base this
[2:24:16] ministry off of Malachi 4 5 and 6. I
[2:24:19] said but he was here for running Jesus
[2:24:21] Christ who is the same yesterday today
[2:24:24] and forever I said it to him and he kind
[2:24:26] of you know he didn't really care to
[2:24:27] hear what I had to say except that the
[2:24:29] fact we believed in the prophet so he
[2:24:30] moved this next point he said well
[2:24:31] that's interesting he said well what do
[2:24:34] you all actually call it I said well we
[2:24:35] believe the message of William Branham
[2:24:37] was the message of Jesus Christ to the
[2:24:38] Bible he said well that's interesting he
[2:24:40] said we believe Malachi 4 too he said in
[2:24:43] our movement is also a message he said
[2:24:45] we believe there's a message he said and
[2:24:47] we believe that in that message of
[2:24:48] Malachi 4 there is a direct connection
[2:24:50] between Malachi 4 and to Revelation 10
[2:24:54] and the Seven Thunders Revelation 10 are
[2:24:56] directly connected to Malachi 4. brother
[2:24:59] you talking about the hair stand up on
[2:25:01] your arms you're already an eerie
[2:25:03] feeling building anyhow
[2:25:05] how close
[2:25:07] and yet go that far off in deception
[2:25:10] man and man actually stood up he said
[2:25:13] the the David crashed up he said I'm the
[2:25:15] lamb to open the seals the one to loose
[2:25:17] the seals and the pastor actually
[2:25:19] challenged him and said no said you're
[2:25:22] not and said that's an antichrist
[2:25:23] teaching that's an antichrist spirit and
[2:25:25] said now what's going to happen is
[2:25:27] either you repent of it or you'll burn
[2:25:28] in the fires what the pastor told him so
[2:25:31] they actually turned the the explosion
[2:25:33] to Ezekiel 9 the prophecy of Ezekiel man
[2:25:35] you say why are you saying all that to
[2:25:38] say they based their things off the same
[2:25:40] scriptures
[2:25:41] [Music]
[2:25:42] they use the same symbols to vindicate
[2:25:44] what they believe
[2:25:46] and look what it ended up in
[2:25:48] but there's a bride using those same
[2:25:50] scriptures
[2:25:52] and look where she's headed
[2:25:55] she's headed to Rapture she has been
[2:25:57] translated
[2:25:59] by the kingdom of God
[2:26:01] why'd you say that preacher I said that
[2:26:03] to tell you this
[2:26:06] the pillar of fire is our God
[2:26:09] not a man
[2:26:12] man guided and look where it landed
[2:26:15] but the pillar of fires guy in this
[2:26:17] bride
[2:26:18] she's walking Worthy

[2:29:15] hey man you feel like John today brother
[2:29:19] Ram said in there in Revelations 5 said
[2:29:22] John saw his name in the book
[2:29:23] [Music]
[2:29:25] hey what a wonderful thing to see your
[2:29:27] name in the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:29:30] the elect
[2:29:32] the elected of God I don't have a one
[2:29:36] bride and that's just Jim Dale God don't
[2:29:39] have a one bride and she's elected
[2:29:41] and as we've always said we are well
[2:29:44] taught we we understand all of our
[2:29:46] brother what he's saying this book
[2:29:49] is you
[2:29:51] the book is you
[2:29:54] you're the book
[2:29:56] by you know the people of the world they
[2:29:58] say we can read you like a
[2:30:01] the Bible says there was a book of
[2:30:03] remembrance written
[2:30:05] well when Jesus reached and grabbed that
[2:30:07] book from the hand of the one sitting on
[2:30:10] the throne if it was a dirty book
[2:30:12] brother Andrew he wouldn't attached him
[2:30:16] he wanted to touch that book
[2:30:18] but when he went
[2:30:21] around come around that throne
[2:30:24] we were on his mind
[2:30:26] he was Bloody he had died for us and he
[2:30:30] died to get those people back
[2:30:33] remember what astounding quote where
[2:30:36] brother Brown says Jesus didn't come to
[2:30:37] bring you an inheritance
[2:30:41] adoption series read it many times you
[2:30:43] get a lot of googly eyes out of it but
[2:30:45] he didn't come to bring you and Harry
[2:30:46] came to bring you back to get to your
[2:30:48] inheritance your inheritance was a book
[2:30:50] before the foundation world with your
[2:30:52] name written in it no way for you to
[2:30:54] fail so when he reached to get that book
[2:30:56] brother Andrew he didn't hesitate
[2:30:59] he said that's me that's mine and those
[2:31:03] back in those days you know how they
[2:31:04] protected the Scrolls
[2:31:07] they put them in skin
[2:31:09] so when he reached to get that book he
[2:31:11] reads and got your skin too he got your
[2:31:13] skin too because this is the son of man
[2:31:16] Ministry this is the flesh Ministry this
[2:31:18] is a Ministry that we are the walking
[2:31:20] living breathing
[2:31:22] bride of Jesus Christ and I truly
[2:31:24] believe let's give our brother another
[2:31:26] hand
[2:31:30] and we appreciate him appreciate his
[2:31:33] wife Coming
[2:31:35] um sister Ryan and little Malachi I told
[2:31:37] him I said well Malachi uh when his son
[2:31:40] gets four we're gonna have to have a
[2:31:41] Malachi for a birthday
[2:31:43] and then a five and six too so but it's
[2:31:46] good to have them with us and and um and
[2:31:49] just love their Ministry and he speaks
[2:31:52] to all of us young and old
[2:31:54] amen and and the word of the Lord is
[2:31:57] true
[2:31:58] and I believe he's been well taught
[2:32:00] himself so I I just really believe that
[2:32:02] we've heard from the Lord today
[2:32:04] we heard from the Lord yesterday and man
[2:32:07] we got to see that that's what it is
[2:32:08] it's a voice of God that speaks now
[2:32:11] someone hear a thunder
[2:32:12] so I'm gonna see lightning
[2:32:15] but Paul
[2:32:16] heard one voice
[2:32:19] and that voice was directed at him
[2:32:23] stall
[2:32:24] you can call them other guy's name that
[2:32:26] was around him they were sitting there
[2:32:27] were standing there going man what was
[2:32:28] that
[2:32:30] was that a message
[2:32:31] Paul said well he's talking to me okay
[2:32:34] hang on a minute because he said Saul
[2:32:36] why do you persecute me he said Lord
[2:32:40] so there was a connection and then we
[2:32:42] know what happened he became Paul but
[2:32:44] them other people it never records them
[2:32:45] other people that were with him ever
[2:32:46] even done anything they just they just
[2:32:48] went off into history
[2:32:50] never to be remembered why because they
[2:32:52] didn't hear the voice
[2:32:54] is that what we're doing today we just
[2:32:56] here because I've always said because we
[2:32:58] got something somebody else don't have
[2:33:00] you know we've got a special message
[2:33:02] well yeah we do have a special message
[2:33:04] but God is the one that gave us the part
[2:33:07] to be worthy and the part to be worthy
[2:33:09] humbles us more than makes us exalted
[2:33:13] white brother I'm saying a revelation he
[2:33:15] said it will not exalt you it will
[2:33:17] humble you it's so humble that God can
[2:33:20] as as all of us have come together today
[2:33:22] we've all got to pass life
[2:33:24] all of us do we're all humans
[2:33:27] but God deemed us Worthy
[2:33:30] he put that in the sea of God's
[2:33:32] forgetfulness never to be remembered
[2:33:33] again
[2:33:34] put a no fishing sign up too right
[2:33:37] right so we're going to listen to what
[2:33:39] the devil said or we're going to listen
[2:33:40] to what God's already said because he's
[2:33:42] the worthy one
[2:33:44] is not so let's just push him out of the
[2:33:46] way I was thinking as brother was
[2:33:49] preaching you know when that seal broke
[2:33:51] the white horse rider rode away yeah
[2:33:54] because there was a revelation come
[2:33:56] forth Satan hates brother William say
[2:33:57] Satan hates Revelation right he hates it
[2:33:59] he can't stand it well you know what
[2:34:02] when the Revelation came that follow us
[2:34:04] on Holy Ghost was not the correct
[2:34:05] baptism
[2:34:06] the devil had to ride away from that
[2:34:09] all the great doctrines that we have
[2:34:11] today the devil can't stand it he's
[2:34:13] nowhere to be found he's rode away from
[2:34:15] it trinitarian Doctrine when it was
[2:34:17] busted out he went right now everything
[2:34:19] Satan was riding away from he was away
[2:34:22] ran away from the prophet he was on his
[2:34:24] horse yeah sure the world loved him but
[2:34:28] he's not a part of us
[2:34:30] that seal broke when that seal broke it
[2:34:32] separated
[2:34:34] and like I say I read that quote last
[2:34:35] Sunday
[2:34:36] I call you bright now
[2:34:38] I put a marker right here and and now
[2:34:41] you you're identified now when I say
[2:34:43] bride from this day forward I'm talking
[2:34:45] about you
[2:34:46] I ain't talking about the I'm not well I
[2:34:49] might be no you're bright
[2:34:51] not Methodist Baptist Pentecostal way
[2:34:53] I'm your bride and I'm talking to you
[2:34:55] that's why he had to separate the bride
[2:34:57] in the church because he was coming to
[2:34:58] the seals of fifth seal and all the
[2:35:00] different ones showing that the church
[2:35:02] went through the tribulation but the
[2:35:04] bride didn't so he had to separate that
[2:35:06] first so he had to get that out of your
[2:35:08] mind
[2:35:09] I told him the other day the greatest
[2:35:11] one of the greatest Revelations and it's
[2:35:13] not it may not be the seals or whatever
[2:35:15] the greatest Revelation that I have is I
[2:35:17] ain't got to go through tribulation
[2:35:20] because all your denominations say we
[2:35:23] have to go through the tribulation a
[2:35:25] part of it anyway well not in this
[2:35:27] church not here no we ain't going
[2:35:29] through it on tribulation praise God
[2:35:31] that's a good enough Revelation to shout
[2:35:32] about for a few days right there anyway
[2:35:34] that you're not that you're deemed
[2:35:36] Worthy
[2:35:37] to be there
[2:35:39] with the man that died for me in you
[2:35:42] and he's here now in all of us in the
[2:35:44] many membered body
[2:35:46] good to have each and every all of you
[2:35:48] here we sure appreciate you we love you

[2:35:53] have some uh there'll be some tacos and
[2:35:55] queso and dip different things down
[2:35:57] there but let me remind you there's a
[2:35:59] lot of people here don't get three or
[2:36:01] four of one item just get an item
[2:36:04] sit down and eat it and if there's
[2:36:06] anything left you can go back don't pile
[2:36:08] your plate full don't be a glutton okay
