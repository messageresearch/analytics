[10:27] prayers all right let's turn to john one
[10:31] we're going to continue on who is this
[10:32] son of man this is part 16.
[10:36] and we're going to talk a little bit
[10:37] tonight
[10:38] about
[10:39] headship
[10:41] about headship and
[10:43] we're going to look
[10:46] at a couple of things that um
[10:49] that i believe the lord showed us this
[10:51] uh yesterday while we were studying for
[10:53] the extra day before yesterday
[10:55] and uh
[10:56] i want you to think about something i
[10:58] was talking about the cloud about it
[10:59] just a little while ago
[11:01] you know jesus
[11:03] he stood up one day and he said
[11:07] the son of man
[11:10] has no place
[11:12] to lay his head
[11:16] now we know that's naturally
[11:18] but why did he say that
[11:20] why did he specifically say
[11:22] there's no place for me to lay my
[11:26] head think about it
[11:29] think a little spiritual about it
[11:32] but something came to me we'll talk
[11:33] about next sunday not
[11:35] this coming sunday but not now so i
[11:37] think he's got a place to lay his head
[11:38] now
[11:40] amen
[11:43] john 1 verse 1 let's bow our heads
[11:47] lord we stand here lord before a group
[11:49] of people
[11:51] lord that we're totally unworthy
[11:55] to be able to open this book
[11:58] and as john wept because no one was
[12:00] worthy
[12:03] the lord you appeared
[12:05] with a book
[12:07] took the book out of the hand of the one
[12:09] on the throne and
[12:11] someone screamed worthy
[12:13] is the lamb
[12:15] to open the book and reveal the seven
[12:17] seals thereof lord we we're living in
[12:19] that time
[12:20] of the revelation
[12:22] of the supreme headship of jesus christ
[12:25] and it's got to be in a bride
[12:27] it's got to be
[12:29] in the total revealing of the word so
[12:31] father we pray that
[12:34] as we were discussing today lord
[12:36] it's all right to be born again
[12:38] it's all right to have a baby but you
[12:41] need to feed the baby
[12:42] the baby needs to mature god is looking
[12:45] in this hour for a mature bride
[12:48] a wife
[12:49] not just a bride a wife somebody that
[12:51] knows every move he makes and and his
[12:53] thoughts or her thoughts and her
[12:55] thoughts are his thoughts
[12:56] father you told us it could happen
[12:59] and now we pray lord that you would
[13:01] continue to help us
[13:03] to get to that spot
[13:06] lord we're trying diligently all of us
[13:10] for you to have the preeminence in our
[13:12] life
[13:13] you give us a way to do it father
[13:14] through the message of the hour
[13:16] a clear path
[13:18] to get to what you've already said
[13:20] father forgive us of our sins and our
[13:22] many mistakes that we get knocked around
[13:24] all during the day lord by satan
[13:26] but lord we know there's a typos
[13:28] we know there's a a bomb in gilead
[13:31] there's a place that we can go back to
[13:33] that we can say satan you can't come in
[13:35] this place
[13:36] satan could never go in the holy of
[13:38] holies
[13:39] and that's what you are today lord
[13:41] you're in the bride you're in the bride
[13:42] the bride is the holy of holies
[13:45] and lord i pray that we'll realize that
[13:46] and we'll take that lord
[13:48] and as the prophet of god said not just
[13:51] have a sword but take the sword and
[13:53] stick it right into the heart of the of
[13:55] the uh of the devil
[13:57] father just be with us now bless us keep
[13:59] us safe
[14:00] bless the ones that are sick and not
[14:02] here lord we pray that it all come back
[14:04] together in you lord
[14:06] we ask your blessings on this service in
[14:07] jesus name
[14:09] amen
[14:10] john 1 verse 1 in the beginning was the
[14:12] word where it was with god the word was
[14:14] god
[14:15] he was in the world the world was made
[14:17] by him and the world knew him not
[14:20] he came to his own and his own received
[14:22] him not
[14:22] but as many as received him to them gave
[14:24] he power
[14:26] power
[14:27] to become the sons of god there's a
[14:29] transformation going on here
[14:32] even to them that believe on his name
[14:34] which were born not of blood nor of the
[14:36] will of the flesh nor the will of man
[14:38] but of god
[14:39] and the word was made flesh
[14:42] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[14:43] glory the glory of the only begotten of
[14:45] the father full
[14:46] of grace
[14:48] and truth you may be seated lord that is
[14:50] blessing to the reading of the word
[14:52] also let's go to hebrews 10 5.
[14:55] we've been reading this but i want to
[14:56] take a little bit different angle today
[14:58] if that's all right
[15:00] wherefore when he cometh into the world
[15:02] now remember when he cometh into the
[15:04] world that means that that's the baby
[15:06] that means jesus is coming
[15:09] not not the father not the jehovah not
[15:12] the god spirit form but he has come down
[15:16] to what a body
[15:18] the word was made flesh these two
[15:20] scriptures connect john 1 14 and hebrews
[15:22] 10 5 is telling the same thing the word
[15:26] was made flesh a body now has prepared
[15:28] me wherefore when he comes into the
[15:29] world he says sacrifice and offerings
[15:31] out what it's not but a body
[15:36] let's read it like this
[15:39] wherefore he comes into the world he
[15:40] says sacrifice and offerings is that
[15:42] what it's not in other words i don't
[15:44] want any of your do's and don'ts i don't
[15:45] want any of your your uh man's ideas i
[15:48] don't want any denominational ideas but
[15:50] this is what i want
[15:52] an offering is that what it's not but a
[15:53] bride
[15:56] but a bride has now prepared me
[15:59] amen
[16:00] a bride
[16:01] to deliver a man child
[16:04] he needs a bride here
[16:07] to deliver adam needed an eve
[16:09] and we knew it wasn't going to be sex
[16:11] but we knew he was going to have to have
[16:13] part of it because the eve typed the
[16:15] church and for christ to come
[16:17] fulfill
[16:19] the word
[16:20] the word made flesh he had to come
[16:22] through flesh and then he now is in
[16:24] flesh his brother daryl was talking
[16:26] about this weekend
[16:28] if he's here that he can't be here in
[16:30] his physical body
[16:33] if the world's looking for jesus that's
[16:35] fine he's already here though hidden
[16:39] in a body
[16:41] just like we were hidden in his body
[16:43] when he walked on the earth
[16:45] now he's hid in our body
[16:48] which is the bride the church and he's
[16:50] the head of it
[16:53] and listen to what the word head means
[16:56] the hell metaphorically it means
[16:58] anything supreme
[17:00] chief
[17:02] chief cornerstone
[17:04] prominent
[17:07] master
[17:09] lord
[17:12] head is where all intelligence is
[17:16] have you ever thought about this
[17:19] i know i'm
[17:21] kind of brother dale and sometimes he
[17:23] says
[17:24] i think a little weird sometimes
[17:26] do you know that every every function of
[17:30] your body
[17:35] there's only one organ above your
[17:37] shoulders
[17:40] all the other organs are below your
[17:42] shoulders
[17:44] but it's run by the one organ
[17:47] that's above your shoulders
[17:49] and it all narrows down everything you
[17:52] do what you're doing right now has to
[17:54] come from here through this narrow thing
[17:56] called a neck
[17:58] and then it goes out into your body
[18:00] right i mean look your nerves don't go i
[18:02] want to talk to my hand no it has to go
[18:04] nerves i want to talk to my hand
[18:07] right so it's not external it's all
[18:09] internal
[18:11] and if you have no heads you have no
[18:12] body i mean if you have a body but what
[18:14] is it it's lifeless
[18:16] that's why the denominations and i'm not
[18:18] talking about baptist methodist
[18:20] pentecostal i'm talking about
[18:21] denominational ideas even that we have
[18:24] can't have a head
[18:27] they've rejected the head
[18:30] the bible says they rejected the head
[18:32] listen true christians do not reject
[18:35] headship right
[18:38] they can't
[18:41] because that's what your new birth is
[18:43] that's right your new birth is
[18:45] submitting to
[18:47] now the problem is brother brown said
[18:49] it's getting it from here to here
[18:52] we got to have head knowledge
[18:55] but if that head knowledge stays head
[18:56] knowledge
[18:58] you're just going through the motions
[19:00] but listen with a soul you have a
[19:02] purpose yes
[19:05] good or bad right
[19:08] good or bad you have a purpose
[19:10] listen you're predestinated for
[19:12] something
[19:15] you didn't just come on the earth and
[19:17] then god made a third
[19:18] a third group of people
[19:20] that just whatever goes whatever god no
[19:24] you're either predestinated to heaven or
[19:25] you predestinated the hell one of the
[19:27] two
[19:28] there is no in between that's right amen
[19:30] and we know it we know that it's not
[19:33] stamped and sealed except in god's mind
[19:36] right
[19:37] you'll be okay with that
[19:39] because remember you come here with a
[19:40] choice
[19:42] and because of your choice god could
[19:43] predetermine what's going to happen amen
[19:46] we all know that but just maybe for some
[19:48] that's watching in online but a body a
[19:51] bride has now prepared me
[19:54] a bride to what deliver a man child
[19:58] that's what the bible said
[20:00] even the woman with the in the sun
[20:04] what did she bring forth
[20:06] a man child
[20:08] it came from the church
[20:10] all right everybody okay with that
[20:12] even when even that being a symbol of
[20:14] israel what's going to happen in israel
[20:16] god's not going to have a bride per se
[20:19] but he's going to have somebody filled
[20:20] with the holy ghost that's going to
[20:22] produce what the bible said they would
[20:25] produce listen every age that's why
[20:29] we were talking one time
[20:31] a long time ago
[20:33] we've got some methodist brother dale's
[20:35] brothers and methodists and we went to a
[20:38] a little methodist conference thing that
[20:40] they asked me to speak at
[20:42] men's breakfast
[20:44] and somebody brought up
[20:46] the church ages or brought up luther or
[20:48] wesley
[20:49] and
[20:51] 90 of the 95 99 of the people
[20:54] didn't have a clue what was going on but
[20:56] maybe there was one percent that did
[20:57] read the bible
[20:59] in revelations where revelations one two
[21:01] and three that show the church
[21:04] and the characteristics of the church
[21:06] but the more you start talking to them
[21:08] the more they say well see the the whole
[21:10] thing behind it brother john they knew
[21:12] we followed a man
[21:16] and even they denied now here's
[21:20] here's john wesley
[21:23] the great founder of the methodist
[21:24] church
[21:26] and they said well we don't follow a man
[21:34] methodist
[21:35] john wesley started your denomination
[21:40] amen one man
[21:43] right so you see how convoluted they get
[21:46] when why because man's ideas get thrown
[21:48] in just like when the headstone came
[21:50] when the
[21:51] literal body of god came jesus christ he
[21:54] was totally misunderstood
[21:57] today he's misunderstood
[21:59] for 2000 years since he put his foot on
[22:02] the earth he's not had a place to lay
[22:03] his head that's right
[22:06] always had a body
[22:09] no doubt he's had a body yeah brother
[22:11] bobby's had a body
[22:13] he's had a church aged body but he's not
[22:15] had a place to lay his head
[22:18] he's not had a place of headship
[22:20] he's not had a place to rest
[22:22] his head
[22:25] except for today
[22:27] today
[22:28] he has a place
[22:29] to lay his head and we'll talk about
[22:31] that a little bit later on um this
[22:33] weekend
[22:35] now let's go to colossians 1 verse 15. i
[22:38] want to thank ryan for having two
[22:40] wonderful
[22:41] girls that are in the back now and if
[22:43] they mess up it's
[22:44] it's mercy and harmony
[22:51] and they won't
[22:52] mercy just fell out of her seat i see
[22:54] her
[23:00] i'm glad we're training people because
[23:01] you know what this thing keeps going on
[23:03] we
[23:04] we got to have somebody to do the do the
[23:06] work
[23:07] that's why we we enjoy
[23:09] cross-training i love even when i was
[23:11] with mcdonald's anywhere i've been i've
[23:13] always loved cross-training i like one
[23:14] person do it because one person does it
[23:16] and he falls sick and can't come in
[23:19] guess what
[23:21] he was lost
[23:23] that's why god's got a body
[23:25] a body of believers a many-membered body
[23:28] not just one guy
[23:29] anymore he has given his self to me and
[23:32] you a part of his
[23:34] head a part of his intelligence
[23:38] has come to me in you
[23:40] amen that's what you have to do with the
[23:42] new birth sure he gives you life
[23:45] but that's not your adoption
[23:46] that's been brother claudine he's on the
[23:48] adoption series and that's what we're
[23:50] going to get into that's why i asked you
[23:51] to listen to that a couple of sundays
[23:52] ago because this is what's leading you
[23:54] can't go up the statue of perfect man
[23:56] without adoption the headstone cannot
[23:57] come to the church without someone with
[24:00] some authority
[24:01] without someone with headship
[24:04] not being the head right
[24:07] no
[24:09] i know we have authority god
[24:11] christ
[24:12] husband wife
[24:14] insert the pastor in there we know we
[24:16] have
[24:16] headship but our headships christ
[24:20] even if a sister is not married and
[24:22] don't have a husband she has a head who
[24:24] christ
[24:25] christ is her head
[24:27] man jezebel hated
[24:30] hated elijah but brother brown said that
[24:33] was her pastor
[24:36] if she would have listened to her
[24:37] headship
[24:39] and instead of ahab
[24:41] she would have lived she wouldn't have
[24:42] been dog meat
[24:45] who is the image of the invisible god
[24:47] the firstborn of every creature so in
[24:48] other words
[24:50] a body developed a a human
[24:53] mortal body
[24:55] for by him were all things created that
[24:57] are in heaven that are in earth visible
[24:58] and invisible whether they be thrones or
[25:00] dominions or principalities or powers
[25:02] all things were created by him and for
[25:04] him you've got this great god
[25:08] and then if you want to look at it and
[25:10] analyze it he's coming down
[25:12] narrowing
[25:14] he's coming down in a funnel
[25:17] an upside down pyramid
[25:22] he's coming down and like then what's he
[25:23] going to do he's going to resurrect
[25:27] and start building that thing we'll get
[25:29] to that with jerubal in just a minute
[25:30] okay
[25:32] for in him were all things created this
[25:33] is great god
[25:34] nobody can understand
[25:37] right
[25:38] all things were created by him for how
[25:39] can a man stand in the middle of nothing
[25:41] and make this that you see today
[25:45] i was looking at just going down the
[25:46] road coming from
[25:48] uh illinois the other day just looking
[25:49] at the difference of the trees up there
[25:51] and the trees down here and a landscape
[25:52] up there and down here
[25:54] and then you go out west and you look at
[25:56] that landscape
[25:58] who did that
[25:59] man didn't do that
[26:01] we just adapt to it
[26:03] but we didn't create it
[26:05] god created that
[26:06] and i was thinking of the day you know
[26:08] if you look at everywhere there's a
[26:10] river you see greenery
[26:13] and there's life
[26:15] possums skunks
[26:17] deer
[26:18] snakes
[26:19] everything thrives around a body of
[26:21] water
[26:22] but now something developed somewhere
[26:24] sometime
[26:25] god's got a group of animals that lives
[26:27] in the desert
[26:29] that there's no water
[26:31] there's places in the united states that
[26:33] there's only like four inches of rain a
[26:35] year
[26:36] four inches of rain a year and you go
[26:38] and look and there's plants and animals
[26:40] out there
[26:42] that's the master builder that's this
[26:43] one we're talking about right here how
[26:44] are you gonna understand that well he's
[26:47] gonna become flesh
[26:49] he's gonna become flesh and not have to
[26:51] talk to you
[26:52] with some
[26:53] you know 8 million volume
[26:56] book
[26:57] he gave us 66 books
[27:00] and it's eternal there's only god can do
[27:03] that man can't do that
[27:04] but god can
[27:06] everything in there you need is right
[27:08] there
[27:09] and it came what the word
[27:12] was made flesh
[27:15] like i said before you flip these pages
[27:17] real fast and all of a sudden a man
[27:19] steps out
[27:20] and there's jesus christ
[27:22] but guess where we got to come from if
[27:24] he's the head and he's the one he came
[27:26] to first where's the intelligence his
[27:28] intelligence is right here
[27:30] he can't do anything this bible says he
[27:33] can't go contrary to that
[27:35] but you and i can because we do it all
[27:37] the time
[27:38] but we're heading towards something
[27:40] we're heading toward headship to where
[27:42] he can have the preeminence
[27:47] and he is before all things
[27:49] and by him all things consist
[27:53] the spring the fall the winter
[27:55] the budding of the trees and all
[27:56] different things that's how he
[27:59] exists
[28:00] or consist of him
[28:02] look but watch
[28:04] narrow it down
[28:06] and he's the head of the body
[28:09] the church
[28:11] who is the beginning
[28:13] the firstborn from the dead
[28:16] and where did he resurrect that right
[28:18] down here this age he resurrected down
[28:20] here and then the church age began
[28:23] on the day of pentecost
[28:24] the holy ghost fell on 120 people
[28:28] with headship that they were looking for
[28:30] now listen they were under jesus when he
[28:33] was alive and well
[28:35] but that wasn't their head
[28:38] because they didn't have a body
[28:42] there was no bride
[28:44] but on the day of pentecost there stood
[28:46] 120 and that was 120 that had all these
[28:50] things working in their life from right
[28:52] here down
[28:53] amen
[28:54] because they had walked with the word
[28:56] himself and they had listened to what he
[28:58] said they had went to church and they
[29:00] had studied
[29:01] a lot of things they didn't understand a
[29:03] lot of things we don't understand
[29:06] amen
[29:10] but the whole point is they started this
[29:11] thing
[29:13] and that's the foundation we're built on
[29:15] the foundation that the apostles and
[29:17] prophets gave us jesus christ being the
[29:20] chief what cornerstone
[29:22] to make the headstone
[29:24] got to have a cornerstone first
[29:26] because look they chopped him off they
[29:28] totally rejected him this is all this
[29:29] was gone
[29:34] out of here
[29:35] gone but he come right back down here
[29:37] and started where like zerubbabel he
[29:39] started on the foundation
[29:41] all right
[29:43] same way as we'll read a quote here in
[29:44] just a little bit where brother branham
[29:46] he kind of
[29:47] well they don't kind of
[29:49] he puts it out there that that's typing
[29:51] him
[29:53] but he does it in a way where nobody's
[29:54] going to understand it except us
[29:58] but he does when he when i'll quote i'll
[30:00] give you the quote in just a few minutes
[30:01] i thought man
[30:02] they didn't know who he was talking
[30:04] about
[30:05] when he was talking about
[30:06] esther and mordecai
[30:08] they didn't know who he was talking
[30:09] about
[30:10] you know why because it was withholding
[30:12] it was not for them it was for us to
[30:14] understand
[30:15] and he is head of the body of the church
[30:17] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[30:18] the dead look that in all things he
[30:20] might have the preeminence when you put
[30:22] the head on top of the body the head is
[30:24] preeminent because you can't do anything
[30:28] without remember what i said with that
[30:29] nerve without that nerve going down
[30:31] through
[30:32] the
[30:34] head
[30:35] to move that finger
[30:37] if there's something severed
[30:39] you can't move that finger on its own
[30:42] you can't use it you can't use this if
[30:44] it's not coming from here
[30:46] that's what's so interesting is
[30:48] how can we do all that because remember
[30:50] the hand's quicker than the eye
[30:53] right
[30:54] that's how they do the magic tricks and
[30:55] stuff but the hands quicker than the eye
[30:59] it can fool the eye
[31:01] your hands
[31:03] can fool the eye but you know where it
[31:04] starts fooling you from
[31:07] right here
[31:08] because this is where the eyes
[31:10] the nerves come and this is where your
[31:12] hands come now look your eyes closer to
[31:14] your brain
[31:15] and your hands the furthest away from
[31:17] your brain but this is that's how god
[31:19] made it
[31:20] that the hand of god
[31:22] your eyes can deceive you
[31:25] but your hands are quicker
[31:28] to hold what to take that sword and jab
[31:30] it to the enemy
[31:31] amen that he might have the preeminence
[31:33] in other words the what the headship
[31:36] all right for it please the father that
[31:38] in him should all fool this
[31:41] dwell all right let's continue on now
[31:42] the masterpiece brother brown said
[31:46] let's read the red save time but
[31:49] the body was built by the word now watch
[31:51] the bible every time you see that
[31:55] i want you to think of bride because
[31:56] listen jesus's corporal body
[32:00] can't save you
[32:05] didn't brother branham say if jesus
[32:07] christ himself was standing right here
[32:09] on this platform like he said
[32:11] in a corporal body with a suit on just
[32:13] like i got on that's what he said
[32:16] he couldn't save you or heal you
[32:18] he's already done it
[32:20] but it has to come through his body
[32:24] the bride was built by the word right
[32:28] which was the prophets and here comes
[32:29] the head of it all jesus comes on the
[32:32] scene that's what we have to go back to
[32:34] we have to go back to jesus christ
[32:37] because he's the head
[32:38] it's where it all originates from
[32:41] that's where your thoughts originate
[32:42] from that's where everything you do
[32:44] originates from right here
[32:46] everybody okay with that
[32:48] jesus came on the scene there when the
[32:49] head piece
[32:51] was put upon it we find in him the
[32:53] entire handiwork of
[32:54] god when he was standing on the earth
[32:57] that was the entire handiwork of god
[33:00] what was it god in human flesh
[33:03] that was the handiwork of god that's
[33:05] something he always wanted to be he
[33:06] wanted to be in human flesh
[33:11] we find in him the perfect reflection of
[33:13] the word
[33:14] for he was the word the fullness of the
[33:16] word
[33:17] listen this guy fulfilled the whole old
[33:20] testament
[33:23] they built their religion on the old
[33:25] testament
[33:27] he was built in that word
[33:30] and they rejected him
[33:33] right
[33:34] they rejected him totally
[33:37] they didn't say well now maybe later on
[33:38] you'll know
[33:40] they called him belzybub
[33:42] they called him the prince of demons
[33:48] but now again god has the perfect
[33:51] masterpiece again who's he talking about
[33:55] he had a perfect masterpiece 2 000 years
[33:57] ago
[34:00] but he's not one again
[34:03] who is that
[34:04] that's the bride
[34:07] that's me and you
[34:09] all right let's go to psalms 85 9.
[34:13] surely his salvation is nigh them that
[34:14] fear him the glory may dwell in our land
[34:17] mercy and truth are met together
[34:20] righteousness and peace have kissed each
[34:21] other
[34:22] god and man became one
[34:26] truth shall spring where
[34:28] out
[34:29] of the earth
[34:32] out of the earth not this earth down
[34:34] here oh yeah it sure tells about his
[34:36] resurrection that he came up out of the
[34:38] earth but out of this earth
[34:40] and righteousness shall look down oh i'm
[34:42] sorry troops shall spring out of the
[34:44] earth
[34:45] earth and righteousness shall look down
[34:48] from heaven heaven and earth is going to
[34:50] kiss what in jesus christ well listen
[34:52] when you got born again
[34:54] come on people when you got born again
[34:57] heaven and earth kissed each other
[35:00] there was a uniting there was a a secret
[35:04] that man will never understand unless
[35:06] you're born again
[35:07] you can't understand god
[35:09] you can't understand why because you're
[35:11] not connected to the head
[35:16] oh you might be connected to a head but
[35:18] it's not the one you're supposed to be
[35:19] connected to
[35:21] like i'm telling brother claude
[35:22] sometimes you listen to this part and
[35:24] sometimes you listen to this part you
[35:26] know the little devil that sits over
[35:27] here and the little you know the little
[35:29] angel that
[35:31] why do you think they got that from the
[35:32] cartoon you know why i didn't just pull
[35:34] that out of the air because that's what
[35:35] they that's what we and we see the same
[35:37] thing you listen to this guy
[35:39] then you listen to this guy
[35:42] well if there's two talking
[35:46] one of them's god
[35:47] and one of them's the devil
[35:49] okay
[35:51] and if one's off the word we know who
[35:53] that guy is
[35:54] but remember in the end time though he's
[35:56] gonna come so close
[36:00] because you know what
[36:02] satan is going to incarnate a pope
[36:05] and speak through him
[36:08] and the world is going to fall at his
[36:10] feet as
[36:11] he being god
[36:15] when we leave this place folks there's
[36:17] going to pope stand up and he's going to
[36:19] do signs and wonders
[36:22] miracles
[36:25] and the whole world
[36:27] is going to be deceived by
[36:29] whole world
[36:31] except 144 000 and 2.
[36:34] amen
[36:36] thank god we'll be gone
[36:39] thank god we'll be gone
[36:40] because you know what it would deceive
[36:42] the very elect if possible you know how
[36:44] i see that we're going to be gone so it
[36:46] ain't possible
[36:48] amen we're going to be out of here the
[36:50] whole world's going to be deceived by
[36:51] this one guy
[36:53] but why can't we take one guy
[36:56] and get revelation from him
[36:58] one guy
[37:00] one guy's gonna deceive the whole world
[37:02] but one guy is gonna save your soul
[37:04] and take you out of here
[37:06] one guy
[37:08] and they called him belgium
[37:10] they might call you the same thing
[37:13] all right let's go to number two god's
[37:14] gifts find their place
[37:17] he was a being on earth a being of time
[37:19] god actually came into time
[37:21] slowed himself down
[37:23] and entered a body
[37:25] a real body a flesh and blood body right
[37:29] and he had to eat and he had to grow we
[37:31] we've read the scripture where he
[37:33] learned by the things he suffered and
[37:34] being made perfect
[37:36] being obedient
[37:41] being obedient
[37:44] you'd think well he's god
[37:46] how can he not be obedient
[37:48] well he was a human
[37:50] he had a human brain that he had to work
[37:52] through
[37:56] we'll get into that maybe later on got a
[37:57] thought on that
[37:59] which means he must had a beginning
[38:01] therefore he created himself a body to
[38:03] live in
[38:05] now what's he doing now i want you all
[38:07] to see both yes
[38:08] because when we say all these he's
[38:10] creating a body well now that was two
[38:12] thousand years ago in the womb of mary
[38:14] that's okay
[38:16] that's the cornerstone
[38:18] but the headstone to the church is pure
[38:20] is knowing where you came from
[38:23] knowing that you're the body he's
[38:25] creating himself a body
[38:28] by the new birth
[38:31] created a body for himself
[38:34] that by this creation he might save the
[38:37] lost creation that he created
[38:40] that's right say that ten times
[38:44] he might save the lost creation that he
[38:47] created
[38:49] he created us perfect
[38:51] but somewhere along the line
[38:54] we lost headship
[38:56] somewhere along the line eve
[38:59] stepped out from headship
[39:02] she'd have stayed under handships she'd
[39:03] have been fine she stepped out and what
[39:06] took another head
[39:10] took another idea
[39:14] and said this is what i like better than
[39:15] this
[39:17] that's what we did
[39:19] born and sinned shaping the nicholas
[39:20] found from my mother's womb a liar
[39:23] doomed on our way to hell but
[39:26] god came to us
[39:29] he said i want to be your savior
[39:32] and you said god i need it
[39:34] i need it
[39:36] because i'm lost
[39:38] cause listen you didn't just come upon
[39:39] this idea
[39:42] please you didn't just come upon this
[39:44] idea
[39:45] you didn't just say
[39:48] no you heard the word you got condemned
[39:51] there was condemnation because you had
[39:53] the wrong husband you were living
[39:57] your substance was of another guy
[40:00] may i say
[40:02] right
[40:03] you were living under another headship
[40:05] under another guy
[40:08] husband
[40:10] but remember if that husband dies
[40:14] you're free to marry again
[40:17] the problem is
[40:18] not getting into marriage in divorce but
[40:20] you got to talk about a little bit here
[40:22] but if you just divorced that husband
[40:24] you had in the world now i'm not talking
[40:25] about natural i'm talking about
[40:26] spiritual
[40:27] you just divorce him he's still alive
[40:30] and he can come back and haunt you
[40:33] and haunt you and haunt you right
[40:36] but if that dude's landing i'm sorry if
[40:39] that dude's laying out there in the in
[40:41] the grave
[40:42] with six feet of dirt on top of him
[40:45] he's not going to bother you ever again
[40:50] that's why the new birth should be
[40:52] taught that way that it's a dying out
[40:55] it's a killing
[40:57] it's bloody
[40:59] jesus said what the kingdom of heaven is
[41:00] taken by white force
[41:03] you take the sword and use that sword
[41:05] kills your old husband
[41:11] put him in the listen
[41:13] put him in the grave
[41:15] don't go back and look at him
[41:18] he's dead he'll do you no good
[41:22] and be married to christ
[41:25] and that's the whole plan
[41:27] to save the lost creation he had to let
[41:30] you
[41:32] get married
[41:34] to your first husband
[41:38] eve got married to satan first
[41:41] remember
[41:42] she was married to adam committed
[41:44] adultery and took this man's idea
[41:48] and got the wrong seed
[41:50] right
[41:51] she'd have stayed with adam she would
[41:53] have got the right seed
[41:55] amen
[41:56] natural
[41:58] but it's also spiritual
[42:00] everybody all right
[42:04] number three
[42:08] see that's why in the layout of seeing
[42:09] church age we see that brother branham
[42:12] he tells us we read revelations 3 14
[42:15] where it says what the beginning of the
[42:17] creation of god
[42:21] that don't even sound right
[42:23] amen
[42:24] that doesn't even sound right
[42:26] the beginning of the creation of this
[42:28] eternal
[42:35] happy birthday yesterday
[42:36] you're welcome
[42:38] where's your sister oh happy birthday
[42:39] yesterday y'all born the same day that's
[42:41] pretty neat
[42:45] happens that way
[42:47] oh sarah was yesterday too
[42:50] and so was well richard marlows was
[42:52] today
[42:53] so what charlotte's is today right
[42:56] no
[42:57] richard's worcestershire today
[43:00] i want to see him again
[43:02] i miss richard marlowe
[43:05] and all the others
[43:08] but when god created himself a body
[43:10] he came down and lived in it now that's
[43:12] what he did with his natural body but
[43:13] that's also what he did on the day of
[43:15] pentecost
[43:16] on the day of pentecost he started a
[43:19] body
[43:20] and he came down and lived in it
[43:24] listen you can doubt all you want to but
[43:26] you got to be like peter yes that's
[43:28] right
[43:29] peter stood up and he said this is that
[43:32] this is what we've been waiting on
[43:34] for three and a half years this man told
[43:36] us these things and it just all went
[43:38] in our head but now
[43:40] it's so clear
[43:41] amen
[43:43] this is that
[43:45] and i identified it with joy right
[43:49] i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh
[43:53] boy what a sermon
[43:58] he started his church like he warned
[44:00] them started
[44:02] by the new birth
[44:04] by god coming and indwelling 120 people
[44:08] and giving them the new birth
[44:10] and then them going out
[44:13] and giving that message to the world
[44:17] christendom today started with 120
[44:19] people
[44:20] amen got to start somewhere
[44:23] he came down and lived in it that's the
[44:25] beginning of the creation of god oh
[44:27] isn't he wonderful
[44:29] and i keep forgetting this quote and
[44:30] i'll try to bring it but brother brown
[44:32] said if he's the beginning of the
[44:34] creation
[44:36] if he's a beginning
[44:38] if he's alpha and amiga
[44:41] the beginning and the end everything in
[44:43] between you know what the in-between is
[44:48] i'm looking at it
[44:50] that's the between part that puts the
[44:52] god and man back together again
[44:55] listen we got separated in the garden of
[44:57] eden
[44:59] god didn't sit up here and go oh
[45:01] how am i gonna get this back together
[45:02] he's like i already got it figured out
[45:06] i've seen the end from the beginning i'm
[45:07] going to see a group of people that i'm
[45:09] not going to put in the first church age
[45:11] i'm not going to put them in the second
[45:13] church age third fourth fifth sixth i'm
[45:15] gonna put them in the seventh church
[45:17] because they're going to be what
[45:19] be able to be spoken to in a way that
[45:22] not luther couldn't do this
[45:24] wesley couldn't speak this way
[45:27] pentecost couldn't speak this way
[45:33] he speaks
[45:35] through us
[45:37] exclusively
[45:39] and i'm not talking about me
[45:40] i'm talking about the five full ministry
[45:42] and you
[45:44] listen i
[45:46] um
[45:47] excuse me brother daryl and i were
[45:49] talking about it
[45:51] we can't make ourselves exclusionist
[45:55] god will do that for you
[45:58] you just be look look at god he just was
[46:00] he just was jesus christ right
[46:03] he just got up every morning i'm jesus
[46:05] christ i'm gonna walk through and i'm
[46:07] gonna do what the father tells me to do
[46:08] right
[46:10] preach a sermon go up on the mountain
[46:12] give him the beatitudes i'm gonna get in
[46:14] the boat and i'm gonna be tired i gotta
[46:16] go to sleep
[46:18] how in the world could you sleep with a
[46:20] boat now that boat wasn't a titanic
[46:23] that boat didn't have like 500 people on
[46:25] it
[46:26] it had 12 13. it had 13 people in it
[46:32] that's a canoe
[46:35] and here this thing's doing this i'm
[46:36] sure it's there rocking and jesus is
[46:38] just laying back here asleep
[46:40] i'm sure he don't have one eye open he's
[46:42] asleep because the bible said he was
[46:43] asleep because they went back there and
[46:45] i said what are you gonna you gonna let
[46:47] us sink
[46:49] now listen here's me and you
[46:52] you got jesus on your boat
[46:54] you got jesus in your boat everybody
[46:56] this is free you got jesus in your boat
[46:59] you know it's jesus
[47:01] right
[47:02] you go back there and you say
[47:04] you gonna let us think
[47:07] what's the deal here
[47:08] we put our faith in you
[47:11] he goes up
[47:12] puts his foot on the bow says peace be
[47:14] still
[47:15] sky clears
[47:17] calm glassy water
[47:20] right
[47:21] and they still don't know who he is
[47:24] they said what kind of man
[47:26] can do these things
[47:29] well god can
[47:32] that's who i would have said only god
[47:34] can do that
[47:35] well this man must be god duh
[47:39] but they did they denied him all the way
[47:41] to his death right right why because
[47:44] they didn't have headship
[47:46] the head was there
[47:48] the head and body of jesus was there
[47:51] but the headship he wanted was not over
[47:54] his body
[47:56] lateral
[47:58] he came to show us how to live with his
[48:00] head on his body
[48:02] so that when the
[48:04] church rejected him buried him
[48:07] he could raise up and say all power and
[48:08] heaven has been given to me why the head
[48:10] and the body had united it began
[48:14] the creation of god
[48:16] what is the creation of god me and you
[48:20] you and i are the creation of god oh
[48:22] yeah mom and daddy because of the fall
[48:26] gave us our body
[48:29] kind of well-known fact
[48:32] but who gave you your soul
[48:34] god did
[48:36] but he got marred
[48:38] because you were born on this side of
[48:40] the fall
[48:41] there's no way for you to get back you
[48:42] were born in sin shaped an iniquity you
[48:44] didn't come the way you were supposed to
[48:45] come
[48:46] you had the wrong headship
[48:48] but now that you're born again
[48:51] you got the right hitchhike
[48:54] if all wrongs
[48:56] have been made right
[48:58] when you get born again
[49:00] you say oh bro wait tomorrow i gotta go
[49:02] to work i got bills to pay ain't got
[49:04] nothing to do with it
[49:06] god didn't save your body
[49:09] he didn't save your spirit
[49:13] he saved your soul
[49:15] you've got to decide
[49:16] remember the conflict conflict between
[49:19] god
[49:19] and satan
[49:21] there's no conflict folks
[49:23] if you take your equate you out
[49:26] you got to put yourself in christ
[49:29] but what do we do
[49:30] we yield to the other we yield to the
[49:33] little pitchfork guy on this side
[49:35] i'm sorry i do maybe y'all don't
[49:38] okay
[49:41] well i guess you don't then i guess i do
[49:42] y'all pray for me okay
[49:46] you love the lord
[49:47] all right let's read
[49:48] let's hebrews 5
[49:50] verse 8
[49:53] though he were a son yet learned he
[49:54] obedience by the things which he
[49:59] suffered
[50:02] i thought he suffered on the cross
[50:06] no
[50:07] that was just a fulfillment or a
[50:09] culmination of what he had done
[50:12] the 30 something years that he lived
[50:19] but during that time see what i'm
[50:20] talking about when talk about adoption
[50:22] during that time remember we read the
[50:24] scripture where he was on the river
[50:26] jordan and
[50:27] he stood there and this spirit came on
[50:29] him like a dove
[50:30] and said this is my son and whom i'm
[50:32] pleased to dwell
[50:35] not hear ye him
[50:40] but he had to be made perfect
[50:43] he became the what
[50:45] author
[50:47] who's the author of the bible
[50:50] paul
[50:52] i was thinking the other day read the
[50:54] book of matthew
[50:56] read the book of matthew and watch him
[50:58] write he never was in some of those
[51:01] places matthew was not now look luke was
[51:03] with paul he wasn't really with
[51:06] jesus
[51:08] so he writes the book of luke having
[51:10] perfect understanding it had to all come
[51:12] by revelation but same way with matthew
[51:14] you read matthew and you go
[51:16] matthew wasn't there when that happened
[51:19] remember matthew was what tax collector
[51:21] or something with me or
[51:23] that guy we don't like
[51:26] god must have liked him he needed him to
[51:28] do his taxes i don't know
[51:30] but you had matthew there and and then
[51:32] you had mark
[51:33] luke and john now john was there the
[51:35] whole time that's why he could write a
[51:36] little bit different
[51:38] john was with jesus the whole time luke
[51:41] wasn't
[51:42] matthew was only a certain length of
[51:44] time but he wrote about the birth
[51:47] the birth of jesus was on this wife and
[51:49] you know what we believe what he said
[51:51] but he wasn't there
[51:53] moses
[51:55] in the beginning was the word
[51:57] we know that was paul
[51:59] but you take that all the way to the to
[52:00] genesis
[52:02] in the beginning god created the heavens
[52:04] and earth who told moses that
[52:06] you see how well this book's written
[52:08] but listen my point is that same person
[52:12] that fired that
[52:14] head
[52:15] or intelligence
[52:17] of matthew mark luke and john paul
[52:19] moses whoever is the same person that's
[52:22] inside of you
[52:24] there's not two people that wrote the
[52:26] bible
[52:27] one person wrote it and now that one
[52:29] person's inside of you why so he can
[52:31] build his body
[52:33] amen
[52:34] it's really simple
[52:36] but we make it so hard
[52:40] brother claude called me today and
[52:43] he said he heard another preacher online
[52:44] saying that we don't need any teaching
[52:46] anymore
[52:48] we've been taught enough well
[52:50] you know what
[52:51] i
[52:52] i ain't
[52:56] when you walk when you get up in the
[52:57] morning and you say i've learned
[52:59] everything i need to learn they are
[53:01] embalming your body
[53:05] hello
[53:09] have you not learned something every day
[53:11] well if you do it natural guess what
[53:13] doesn't god listen if god don't talk to
[53:15] you every day and i'm not talking about
[53:16] audible voice but if god doesn't talk to
[53:18] you in something
[53:22] what are you doing
[53:25] because look the intelligence look
[53:28] my brain
[53:30] i do have one i've got a ct scan to
[53:32] prove it and i have a heart don't call
[53:35] me heartless ever again
[53:37] i got proof
[53:40] when they did that cat when they did
[53:41] that heart cath it didn't go out my
[53:42] shoulder it went right in my heart
[53:44] and thank god there was nothing there
[53:46] see there there was nothing there
[53:49] but look everything you do every day
[53:51] comes from right here everything
[53:54] everything you do every day comes from
[53:56] your head
[53:58] so when you get up in the morning and
[53:59] you say brain
[54:01] we've learned all we're gonna learn
[54:04] we're not learning nothing else
[54:06] he's gonna say lights out
[54:10] heart stop lungs stop
[54:13] y'all stop because he's done he's
[54:14] finished
[54:16] so if we don't need teaching then we're
[54:18] dead
[54:21] and we're ready to i guess
[54:24] morph into something
[54:27] i know what they're saying
[54:29] and i want you to see something i'm dead
[54:31] serious
[54:32] if you don't have teaching
[54:34] you're going to be
[54:36] deceived if you have manifestation if
[54:39] you have people running the aisle that's
[54:41] okay well and fine
[54:43] but brother brown said when you jump up
[54:47] he said you better be able to live it
[54:49] when you hit the ground well how you
[54:50] gonna be able to live it if you don't
[54:51] know it
[54:54] i love
[54:55] andrew glover and the different ones it
[54:57] kind of gets you you know that's good
[55:00] gives you some bodily exercise that a
[55:02] lot of us need
[55:06] but when you go to work on monday
[55:10] and tuesday
[55:12] and two weeks later
[55:16] and all that's gone
[55:18] and you're sitting in a pit
[55:21] and all you see is the devil on all four
[55:23] sides
[55:27] you're gonna go
[55:28] no that ain't gonna get you out
[55:31] that's right you know what gets me out
[55:33] you know what to say what satan can't
[55:34] stand he can't stand the word but he
[55:36] can't stand you living it
[55:38] you know what the prophet of god said he
[55:40] can't stand you living it because he
[55:42] can't live it he can motivate
[55:45] but he can't live it
[55:47] so that's what i want to understand and
[55:48] that's what jesus he learned by the
[55:50] things which he suffered in other words
[55:54] growth
[55:56] and being made perfect now that's what
[55:58] me and you are coming to didn't jesus
[55:59] stand up one day and say be you
[56:00] therefore perfect or complete
[56:03] now how can we be complete if we don't
[56:05] have a head
[56:09] remember brother branham was the only
[56:11] one that could say this
[56:12] he said god
[56:14] is not complete without you
[56:18] that's what he come for
[56:21] he come to show that it wasn't just all
[56:23] jesus standing there wrapped up in a
[56:24] package
[56:27] many people believe
[56:28] jesus can is am i okay
[56:31] how many people just how many there's a
[56:33] lot of people believe that jesus was
[56:35] almighty god
[56:37] but like brother brown said they can't
[56:38] get him off the cross
[56:40] he died for me two thousand years ago
[56:43] but i can't help this what i do
[56:46] you know what he's doing they're pushing
[56:48] him back to calvary
[56:50] they're putting him back on the cross
[56:51] what did brother brown say
[56:53] i indict this generation
[56:56] for the second crucifixion
[56:59] of jesus christ
[57:00] in other words the son of man is the one
[57:02] that was crucified he wasn't talking
[57:04] about the son of god he's talking about
[57:05] the son of man
[57:07] they put the son of man back on the
[57:08] cross why they couldn't get him off
[57:12] that's right and put him to an open
[57:14] chain
[57:15] that's why jesus stood up one day
[57:18] we'll not read it we'll skip through it
[57:19] girls you're going to have to skip
[57:20] through a couple of these so i can get
[57:22] finished
[57:23] he stood up on the mountain one day
[57:26] peter james and john was with him
[57:30] voice from heaven a cloud comes down
[57:34] enfolds them
[57:36] in other words they got caught up in a
[57:38] cloud
[57:42] they got caught up in the cloud
[57:46] and heard a voice
[57:49] that said this is my beloved son
[57:52] he's been made perfect he's done what i
[57:54] told him to do
[57:56] he's fixing to go die
[57:59] here
[58:00] ye
[58:01] him
[58:02] in other words if you're going to get it
[58:04] you don't play that
[58:09] here you him
[58:13] that was not staged
[58:19] but how are me and you gonna make it
[58:20] with any less
[58:23] that's right
[58:24] than that
[58:26] and god taking you up on a mountain
[58:30] mountain
[58:31] apart the bible says apart from the
[58:33] world
[58:36] james and john
[58:38] and they got it all wrong too peter
[58:40] stoops up and he says okay let's make
[58:41] three tabernacles this is a nice place
[58:44] it's kind of flat up here let's just
[58:45] make three tabernacles let's make a
[58:47] trinity
[58:51] because the bible said when
[58:53] peter shut up
[58:55] they didn't see but one guy
[58:57] they saw jesus only
[59:00] and then when they got ready to come
[59:02] down the mountain
[59:03] they were in wonderment
[59:06] what just happened
[59:09] what's going on here
[59:10] we were in a vision
[59:12] we saw you
[59:14] glorified the prophet of god said
[59:16] because he had he was had an aura around
[59:18] him
[59:19] and there was moses and elijah
[59:22] speaking of the second coming prophet
[59:24] says
[59:26] they didn't understand that
[59:28] and jesus said look tell this vision to
[59:30] nobody because in other words nobody's
[59:32] going to understand it
[59:34] until the son of man
[59:36] be risen again
[59:38] from the dead
[59:40] risen again from the dead
[59:43] in other words if you rise again that
[59:45] means you died one time
[59:47] and you rose again
[59:50] why
[59:51] because of what brother brown did he
[59:53] indicted this generation
[59:55] for putting him back on the cross and
[59:57] totally denying headship
[59:59] listen father son holy ghost you can't
[1:00:01] get headship out of that now look god
[1:00:03] winked at the ignorance of the people
[1:00:07] and you know without a prophet telling
[1:00:08] us that i'd have a hard time with it
[1:00:11] but you got to go back and see that
[1:00:13] their age was not
[1:00:15] the head age
[1:00:17] it could have been the foot
[1:00:19] it could have been the body
[1:00:21] could have been the arm
[1:00:22] which was a piece
[1:00:24] and it was controlled by the head but
[1:00:26] you know what happened somewhere between
[1:00:27] here and here there was a man's ideas
[1:00:29] got involved there was a
[1:00:31] another head come over
[1:00:34] father son holy ghost baptism is not in
[1:00:36] the mind of god
[1:00:39] these denominational ideas i'm talking
[1:00:41] about ours
[1:00:43] these ideas that are contrary to god's
[1:00:44] word never came from the mind of god
[1:00:48] that's what god's been working with
[1:00:49] that's what god's been dealing with down
[1:00:51] through the church ages what a gracious
[1:00:54] god
[1:00:56] when the first false doctrine started
[1:00:58] back in the first church age i'd have
[1:01:00] killed them all
[1:01:02] and started over again
[1:01:04] you know what brother brown said god
[1:01:05] should have done with adam
[1:01:08] adam could have said i won't don't want
[1:01:10] this anymore i want you to make me
[1:01:12] another one
[1:01:13] but see
[1:01:15] just like me and you and god
[1:01:18] we're inseparable
[1:01:20] even though the dirty things we do we
[1:01:22] are inseparable to god if you're a child
[1:01:25] of god
[1:01:26] eve was a literal part of adam
[1:01:29] bone of his bone flesh of his flesh when
[1:01:32] you and i get born again we're born of
[1:01:34] his bone flesh of his flesh
[1:01:37] prophet continues life of his life
[1:01:42] do we have a life
[1:01:44] centered
[1:01:45] around jesus christ
[1:01:47] are we just in the message
[1:01:55] amen the biggest problem i've seen in my
[1:01:59] 20-something years coming back to the
[1:02:00] lord
[1:02:03] because see i came up from
[1:02:05] from the 60s
[1:02:07] were man they didn't know anything
[1:02:09] there was no message church on every
[1:02:11] corner
[1:02:12] we only had tapes and we had it was just
[1:02:14] real to real
[1:02:15] and you'd only get so many and then
[1:02:16] you'd only get so many books so you had
[1:02:18] partial understanding but man was just
[1:02:21] like god sent a prophet which is fine
[1:02:24] that's a good foundation
[1:02:26] zerubbabel
[1:02:28] right as we're going to read here in a
[1:02:29] minute zerubbabel good foundation
[1:02:31] got to start
[1:02:32] somewhere but did they take god sent a
[1:02:35] prophet and take it over here to another
[1:02:38] headship and say william brown was our
[1:02:39] head
[1:02:42] yes they did
[1:02:44] when they said he was god
[1:02:47] they created another headship
[1:02:50] that's why he said he said they can't be
[1:02:53] two heads
[1:02:55] he said if you call me jesus christ
[1:02:57] you've called me the antichrist
[1:03:00] right you know what he said and i agree
[1:03:01] with him because it would have been
[1:03:03] anti-the anti-word
[1:03:06] but he indicted the generation that was
[1:03:09] then
[1:03:10] so that me and you could have a chance
[1:03:13] to realize we're not putting him back on
[1:03:16] the cross
[1:03:18] no he's not dead
[1:03:20] he's alive
[1:03:22] he's right here his brother
[1:03:24] daryl was talking about he's here we we
[1:03:26] keep hearing that we keep hearing when
[1:03:28] we're gonna start believing it
[1:03:31] he is here
[1:03:32] hallelujah and then you go home and go
[1:03:34] up i don't know if it is or not
[1:03:38] i don't know if he's the second person
[1:03:39] third person i don't know if he's still
[1:03:41] in heaven i don't know if well brother
[1:03:43] branham he's he must be god
[1:03:46] oh lordy
[1:03:50] unless you're born again you're not
[1:03:51] going to see
[1:03:53] the kingdom of god
[1:03:56] brother branham on the meanest man i
[1:03:57] know number four he says jesus's first
[1:03:59] doctrine is you must be born again
[1:04:05] get him girls
[1:04:09] that was his first
[1:04:10] doctrine now what's the first doctrine
[1:04:12] you heard when you come in the message
[1:04:14] god sent a prophet
[1:04:17] brother brown says uh
[1:04:19] the next quote
[1:04:20] he says uh
[1:04:22] i think maybe we're not getting them
[1:04:27] we're getting them to a theory
[1:04:31] is that what this is
[1:04:33] listen to most people
[1:04:35] it is a theory
[1:04:38] it's something new that you've got
[1:04:40] that they don't have
[1:04:42] and see that's not god
[1:04:45] that's not god
[1:04:46] the only people jesus excluded
[1:04:50] was the religious people of the world
[1:04:52] the pharisees and sadducees i'm afraid
[1:04:54] today that too many of us are not
[1:04:55] getting people to christ we're getting
[1:04:58] them to a church to a theory
[1:05:02] is this message just a theory
[1:05:07] or is it a reality
[1:05:09] if you're born again it can only be a
[1:05:12] reality
[1:05:13] yeah
[1:05:15] but if you're not born again it's a
[1:05:16] theory
[1:05:20] we heard that jesus resurrected you know
[1:05:21] that was a theory
[1:05:24] back in the first church age
[1:05:26] that was a theory when they walked up to
[1:05:28] whoever that was pilate and pilate said
[1:05:32] or kaifa said don't
[1:05:33] don't tell me resurrected tell them the
[1:05:36] soldiers took his or his disciples took
[1:05:38] his body and
[1:05:39] tossed it out
[1:05:42] isn't that what confidence is saying
[1:05:43] today
[1:05:45] you're not the body
[1:05:50] devil's saying today
[1:05:52] you're not the body
[1:05:53] because caiaphas wasn't the high priest
[1:05:56] of god
[1:05:57] he might have been the high priest of
[1:05:58] israel at the moment
[1:06:00] but he wasn't a high priest of god
[1:06:01] because god didn't tell him that he put
[1:06:04] god on the cross
[1:06:06] and he will be
[1:06:07] condemned for that
[1:06:09] we're getting them to a church to a
[1:06:11] theory but we must get them to christ
[1:06:14] he is the only one the only one that has
[1:06:16] life
[1:06:17] he that has the son has life and if the
[1:06:19] life of a man look that's dead
[1:06:22] be projected in you
[1:06:24] he will live the same life
[1:06:27] you will live the same life
[1:06:29] he lived that's why christ had to die
[1:06:32] and come back on the day of pentecost in
[1:06:34] your body
[1:06:35] not his body
[1:06:38] right not his corporal body his corporal
[1:06:40] body is gone he can't have two bodies
[1:06:42] here at the same time
[1:06:44] everybody okay with that
[1:06:47] truly elias must first come and restore
[1:06:49] all things
[1:06:51] that's what jesus said in matthew 17 8.
[1:06:55] let's read this one quote number six
[1:06:57] girls
[1:07:03] y'all are hired
[1:07:07] now watch him now we've read this before
[1:07:10] but let's just look at it real quick now
[1:07:12] when the holy spirit first fell on the
[1:07:13] church
[1:07:15] it was on the eastern people in
[1:07:16] jerusalem right 120. he's talking about
[1:07:18] 120 on peru
[1:07:20] that's where the holy ghost fell
[1:07:22] great signs and wonders were done by the
[1:07:23] church in the early pentecostal age of
[1:07:26] the early church that's
[1:07:28] down there
[1:07:29] ephesians or ephesus
[1:07:32] when paul was alive peter was alive john
[1:07:34] was alive luke and all the different
[1:07:36] ones
[1:07:37] then the next round of apostles
[1:07:41] cycle
[1:07:43] what'd they start doing
[1:07:46] taking other headship
[1:07:48] right well cyrenthius
[1:07:51] jesus was a light substance of god
[1:07:54] therefore he couldn't be all god
[1:07:56] he was a part of god therefore
[1:07:59] there's a holy ghost in there somewhere
[1:08:02] because it's got to come back on you
[1:08:03] that's two
[1:08:05] and then the son father son holy must be
[1:08:07] three
[1:08:08] must be a trinity
[1:08:12] the next round of apostles then came in
[1:08:14] the catholic church
[1:08:16] then fifteen hundred years watch what
[1:08:17] brother is doing he's bringing it
[1:08:20] then the lutherans
[1:08:22] then from then on down it's been a day
[1:08:24] where the light went out
[1:08:27] he's done about our day
[1:08:30] after luther was wesley pentecost in us
[1:08:34] remember the bible tells us
[1:08:37] be a dark day
[1:08:39] but they'll be light in the evening time
[1:08:42] then from then on down it's been a day
[1:08:44] where the light went out
[1:08:47] remember brother branham when he drew
[1:08:48] the church ages
[1:08:49] the seventh church age was totally
[1:08:51] blacked out he said i put a little light
[1:08:53] in there what was that little light menu
[1:08:57] because really that black listen folks
[1:09:00] that black in the church ages is not the
[1:09:02] centers of the earth
[1:09:05] have you ever thought about that that's
[1:09:07] not all the sinners
[1:09:09] that's the religious people
[1:09:12] the people that heard the word and
[1:09:14] didn't didn't hold it
[1:09:16] that's what that black part is because
[1:09:18] remember what did jesus say he said if
[1:09:19] that lie didn't you be darkness
[1:09:21] how great is that darkness
[1:09:23] think about that
[1:09:25] caiaphas the light he thought he had
[1:09:28] was darkness that was the devil talking
[1:09:30] through him
[1:09:32] and it's been a daylight enough
[1:09:35] that you could see jesus was the son of
[1:09:37] god
[1:09:38] you should repent
[1:09:41] but the real bright light of the holy
[1:09:43] ghost has never shined through these
[1:09:44] ages now
[1:09:46] go back to the first church age
[1:09:48] powerful people
[1:09:52] apostles walking down the road
[1:09:55] and their shadow healed people
[1:09:58] silver and the gold have i none peter
[1:10:00] said but such as i have give unto thee
[1:10:02] rise and walk
[1:10:05] the great things paul did
[1:10:07] all the different ones
[1:10:10] i'm just reading what the prophet said
[1:10:13] but the real bright light of the holy
[1:10:16] ghost has never shined through those
[1:10:18] ages
[1:10:20] why he's talking about the headstone
[1:10:23] he's talking about
[1:10:25] that holy ghost
[1:10:27] not the one down here
[1:10:31] they're not two
[1:10:33] you get the holy ghost as a baby
[1:10:34] remember
[1:10:35] baby baby was just born if they don't
[1:10:38] feed it baby die
[1:10:40] yet it is a baby yet it's a fountain
[1:10:44] but they gotta feed it
[1:10:46] diaper it
[1:10:47] nurture it
[1:10:49] see it at school
[1:10:51] learn by the things you suffer
[1:10:53] see i didn't suffer much in high in
[1:10:55] school but tears did
[1:10:58] he's still suffering now i didn't say
[1:11:00] that brother boyd said that
[1:11:05] he never i don't think t ever got the
[1:11:08] a's and the b's part i think he just
[1:11:09] started at c i don't throw all the way
[1:11:12] through okay he's shaking his head
[1:11:14] just to lighten it up a little bit
[1:11:17] but the real bright light of the holy
[1:11:18] ghost has never shined through these
[1:11:19] ages why they've never come to full
[1:11:21] maturity they've never had to produce a
[1:11:23] headstone
[1:11:24] or a headship like we produce not a
[1:11:27] different head
[1:11:29] but look
[1:11:31] if they take false doctrine
[1:11:34] you and i take false doctrine it is not
[1:11:37] the headship of christ
[1:11:40] can't be
[1:11:41] that's why it took brother branham to
[1:11:43] come from 47 to 63
[1:11:46] to preach us back to where we could
[1:11:48] listen he preached the body back
[1:11:50] together
[1:11:53] because it was all separated
[1:11:56] in denomination
[1:11:58] but he brought the body back together
[1:12:00] and then what did he do he
[1:12:02] said he's here
[1:12:06] when the seals broke that's when the
[1:12:08] headstone came
[1:12:11] amen i just believe that
[1:12:14] from 47 to 63 it's just what he's saying
[1:12:17] right here there's just enough light for
[1:12:18] them to get born again what brother
[1:12:20] brown branham say what brother brown say
[1:12:23] he said go on as you are
[1:12:25] live a good simple christian life
[1:12:29] he said because if you do all these
[1:12:30] other things he said it'll twist you for
[1:12:32] the way from god why because he knew
[1:12:33] there would be ideas come
[1:12:37] thunders
[1:12:38] had to be seven men
[1:12:40] had to be this i had to be the virtues
[1:12:42] had to be this had to be that
[1:12:44] right
[1:12:45] he said go on and live a good simple
[1:12:47] christian life
[1:12:48] why because it wasn't for them
[1:12:50] they were not to produce the headstone
[1:12:53] the people that got the revelation of
[1:12:55] the seals later on
[1:12:57] is the ones to produce the headstone
[1:12:59] we're the only one that knows
[1:13:01] what the headstone's about
[1:13:06] ask somebody
[1:13:08] what do you think the headstone is
[1:13:10] if they'll say christ they'll say
[1:13:11] where's he at
[1:13:17] where was that certainly the bible said
[1:13:18] it wouldn't as the prophet said it would
[1:13:21] just as sure as he said they couldn't
[1:13:22] believe because isaiah said there hasn't
[1:13:24] been light because the prophet said now
[1:13:26] look
[1:13:28] there's been enough light
[1:13:30] to know that you ought to do right and
[1:13:32] wrong
[1:13:34] when you get born again you ought to
[1:13:35] know right from wrong
[1:13:37] baby form
[1:13:40] okay you're going to make mistakes
[1:13:42] baby knows as he gets older not to touch
[1:13:44] that
[1:13:45] thing that's hot
[1:13:48] right
[1:13:49] but you might have to smack his hand
[1:13:51] every once in a while because he's still
[1:13:52] going to reach for whatever you tell him
[1:13:54] listen whatever you tell them not to do
[1:13:56] they're going to do it anyway
[1:13:58] so the best thing to do is say look
[1:13:59] drive 90 miles an hour okay don't go
[1:14:01] through and stop go out through the stop
[1:14:02] sign go through the red lights run by
[1:14:04] the police running 100 miles an hour
[1:14:05] okay
[1:14:08] you better never
[1:14:10] but y'all do the opposite of what we
[1:14:11] tell you
[1:14:13] i never did that but y'all do
[1:14:16] lord forgive me
[1:14:20] but see that's what we've all done
[1:14:22] [Applause]
[1:14:23] so we've all done that in christianity
[1:14:26] if you can't see your christian walk in
[1:14:27] your own life you got a problem
[1:14:30] good or bad
[1:14:32] good or bad
[1:14:34] usually we remember all the bad
[1:14:36] but there is some good in there
[1:14:38] because god puts you here for a purpose
[1:14:42] he puts you here to fulfill it doesn't
[1:14:43] matter if you're full of the fulfilled
[1:14:45] the first joint of your little finger
[1:14:47] of god's little finger
[1:14:49] that's okay
[1:14:51] but there's been enough light
[1:14:52] to know that you believed on the
[1:14:54] resurrection of the lord jesus
[1:14:56] accept him as your personal savior put
[1:14:59] your name on the church book
[1:15:01] and lived the good life
[1:15:06] but as far as signs and wonders in the
[1:15:08] direct ray of the sun shining it hasn't
[1:15:10] been since
[1:15:12] pentecost
[1:15:14] now he didn't mean pentecost 1906 he
[1:15:16] meant this pentecost down here
[1:15:18] not azusa street he's already passed
[1:15:20] azusa street
[1:15:22] they've done lost it
[1:15:24] when they cabbage down god moved on
[1:15:30] everybody all right
[1:15:31] let's go to psalms 118.
[1:15:34] i will praise thee for thou has heard me
[1:15:37] and art become my salvation
[1:15:39] the stone which the builders refuse who
[1:15:42] are the builders
[1:15:44] preachers yes
[1:15:46] head of the church
[1:15:48] not
[1:15:49] the head
[1:15:50] but a head of a church a head of a
[1:15:52] denomination
[1:15:55] the stone which the builders refused
[1:16:00] like somebody said one time they're
[1:16:01] they're putting the building together
[1:16:03] and they light this one stone
[1:16:06] to get it all started
[1:16:09] right and it's you know his brother
[1:16:11] gary's a
[1:16:12] carpenter and a lot of us try to be
[1:16:17] but you lay out your two befores
[1:16:19] your tuba sixes
[1:16:21] your your blocks go over here
[1:16:24] your cement
[1:16:26] you don't start with your shingles
[1:16:32] most of us would like to
[1:16:34] but if you're going to build a house you
[1:16:36] don't
[1:16:36] you don't buy your shingles first
[1:16:39] unless you want to save some money but
[1:16:40] you don't buy your singles
[1:16:42] you buy you what foundation material
[1:16:46] cause that's the most important
[1:16:48] it ain't going to matter what
[1:16:50] amount of shingles you pay for
[1:16:54] if you don't have a firm foundation
[1:16:57] them shingles are going to fall off
[1:16:59] i don't care if you got 30-year 50-year
[1:17:01] shingles
[1:17:02] your foundation's got to be right
[1:17:05] the stone which the builders refuse in
[1:17:06] other words they said we're not going to
[1:17:08] use that
[1:17:10] we're going to start over here
[1:17:12] we're going to start over here with the
[1:17:13] rafters for the ceiling
[1:17:15] you know what he's saying
[1:17:17] they refused
[1:17:20] to use him
[1:17:22] they refused the word
[1:17:26] they refused the fullness of the word
[1:17:29] they refused it's become the headstone
[1:17:31] of the quarter in other words
[1:17:34] if they knocked him off over there in
[1:17:35] the top
[1:17:36] he just said okay
[1:17:38] i'm gonna start down here
[1:17:40] i'm gonna make it real wide
[1:17:42] i'm gonna take my blocks
[1:17:44] and i'm going to build this place
[1:17:48] man cannot build
[1:17:50] the body of god
[1:17:53] god builds the body of god
[1:17:55] through men
[1:17:56] because watch this
[1:17:58] let's skip all the way now to let's go
[1:18:00] to ezra 4 verse 1.
[1:18:03] we know we read ephesians where they're
[1:18:05] built on the foundation of the apostles
[1:18:06] the prophet jesus christ being the chief
[1:18:08] cornerstone in whom all the building
[1:18:10] fitly framed together growth into a holy
[1:18:13] temple in the lord that's me and you

[1:19:00] after the 70 years
[1:19:04] have i got that
[1:19:06] we're gonna get in a little bit not all
[1:19:07] the 70 weeks of daniel but remember they
[1:19:09] were in captivity
[1:19:10] what happened when they were in
[1:19:12] captivity god destroyed and scattered
[1:19:15] the temple right
[1:19:18] destroyed everything
[1:19:20] okay
[1:19:21] and they were promised though
[1:19:23] that they were going to rebuild
[1:19:26] according to daniel 70 wheat
[1:19:29] they're going to rebuild the temple
[1:19:31] right
[1:19:33] they'll be okay
[1:19:34] listen to me just for a minute because
[1:19:36] look if we can go ezra and nehemiah was
[1:19:39] the two ones that did it
[1:19:42] um
[1:19:43] but now remember they stopped in between
[1:19:45] but there's a story here hang on
[1:19:47] now when the adversaries
[1:19:49] of judah and benjamin
[1:19:52] heard that the children of the captive
[1:19:55] builded the temple unto the lord god
[1:19:58] of israel
[1:20:01] this is the lord god of israel's temple
[1:20:03] right now
[1:20:04] anyway everybody got that right here you
[1:20:06] mind
[1:20:09] you wash your hair
[1:20:12] they had adversaries listen they were
[1:20:14] god's people really they were god's
[1:20:16] people
[1:20:17] at this time in the old testament they
[1:20:19] were god's chosen people
[1:20:22] and they were told that after they were
[1:20:24] going to be in captivity god was going
[1:20:26] to scatter the adversary
[1:20:29] and they were going to go back into
[1:20:31] jerusalem
[1:20:32] and build a temple they had to get an
[1:20:34] edict from either
[1:20:36] cyrus or the other one
[1:20:38] help me bomb
[1:20:39] anyway there was two of them okay
[1:20:41] everybody got there
[1:20:43] read ezra if you want to give you
[1:20:45] something to do
[1:20:47] now what's happening
[1:20:50] there's a group of people
[1:20:52] that wants to build god's temple back
[1:20:56] and there's a group of people always an
[1:20:58] adversary that does not want that temple
[1:21:01] to be built
[1:21:02] everybody with me
[1:21:04] you with me
[1:21:06] two groups there's an adversary and
[1:21:09] there's somebody doing what god said for
[1:21:11] them to do
[1:21:12] everybody with me amen are we in 2022
[1:21:15] now amen okay take this as an allegory
[1:21:19] everybody know what that allegory is
[1:21:22] it's a story with an underlying meaning
[1:21:24] this story happened
[1:21:27] 4 500 years ago
[1:21:29] but the story is unfolding tonight
[1:21:32] amen there's an adversary that doesn't
[1:21:34] want this temple to be completely built
[1:21:38] there's an adversary that doesn't want
[1:21:40] this temple to be completely built
[1:21:41] because you know what they know
[1:21:43] they know
[1:21:45] that when that temple's built
[1:21:48] god's coming in
[1:21:51] god's coming
[1:21:52] god's going to get into that temple
[1:21:55] and they're going to be able to do
[1:21:56] powerful things
[1:22:00] they're going to be in a place to where
[1:22:01] if they do get
[1:22:03] caught in the belly of a whale
[1:22:06] all they had to do was turn
[1:22:09] and look toward the temple
[1:22:12] and they would be saved that gives me
[1:22:13] goose bumps i'm sorry
[1:22:15] right there all that
[1:22:17] nothing else
[1:22:20] oh
[1:22:22] what what's wrong with you
[1:22:24] all that jonah had to do was find north
[1:22:26] south east and west
[1:22:29] find out which way the temple was and
[1:22:31] you know what when he got around that
[1:22:32] seaweed
[1:22:34] and he looked toward the temple he said
[1:22:36] god you promised
[1:22:38] amen
[1:22:39] that if i could get to where i could
[1:22:41] look toward that temple
[1:22:42] that you would deliver me
[1:22:44] the next morning he got thrown out in
[1:22:47] nineveh
[1:22:48] where he was supposed to been in the
[1:22:50] first place
[1:22:52] same way with me and you amen
[1:22:54] but now there was an adversary that
[1:22:55] didn't want this temple built
[1:22:58] but there was a group of people that was
[1:22:59] going to give their life
[1:23:01] to get that temple bill everybody got it
[1:23:04] then they came to zerubbabel
[1:23:06] boy he's the chief captain
[1:23:09] jerubal knows how to build this temple
[1:23:13] yeah right the gentiles didn't know how
[1:23:15] to build it
[1:23:16] jerubal had seen the temple before
[1:23:21] in all its glory
[1:23:23] and he had a vision
[1:23:25] because they didn't have a google
[1:23:28] he had it in his head
[1:23:30] he knew the dimensions
[1:23:32] he knew the colors
[1:23:34] he was all-knowing
[1:23:38] everybody getting this
[1:23:41] it took a man
[1:23:43] that knew how to build
[1:23:45] then they came to zerubbabel and to the
[1:23:47] chief of the fathers
[1:23:49] and said unto them
[1:23:54] can we help y'all
[1:23:57] can we help y'all build this thing cause
[1:24:01] we're going to destroy it once we build
[1:24:02] it
[1:24:03] ain't that the devil
[1:24:05] let me come to church with you
[1:24:07] can i come to church with you
[1:24:08] can i help you build your temple
[1:24:11] yeah i'll give you something to build it
[1:24:12] with
[1:24:13] look how sly they were look let us build
[1:24:16] with you for we seek your god
[1:24:19] liars
[1:24:21] as you do
[1:24:23] and we do sacrifice unto him since the
[1:24:25] days of air shadow and king of assure
[1:24:27] which brought us up hither in other
[1:24:30] words they knew how to worship
[1:24:33] they just didn't want that temple belt
[1:24:37] satan to let you worship a lot
[1:24:40] but when you start putting
[1:24:43] the blocks on top of the blocks
[1:24:46] and the mortar
[1:24:49] faith
[1:24:50] virtue
[1:24:51] knowledge
[1:24:52] all these stones of revelation
[1:24:55] that your adversary
[1:24:59] don't want you to do that
[1:25:01] but now let me tell you something what
[1:25:02] god will give you though he'll give you
[1:25:05] as brother broom said prophetic insight
[1:25:08] watch
[1:25:09] but zerubbabel
[1:25:11] and jeshua
[1:25:13] and the rest of the chief of the fathers
[1:25:14] of israel
[1:25:16] are not going to be fooled
[1:25:19] because they know how to build a temple
[1:25:21] these other people don't
[1:25:24] you have nothing to do with us
[1:25:27] oh hallelujah
[1:25:29] that's pretty bold
[1:25:32] satan you have nothing to hold me with
[1:25:35] you have nothing to do with us to build
[1:25:37] a house under our god
[1:25:39] but we ourselves together will build
[1:25:41] unto the lord god of israel
[1:25:44] how bold is that
[1:25:47] as king cyrus the king of persia have
[1:25:49] commanded us
[1:25:50] then the people of the land watch this
[1:25:53] they weakened the hands of the people of
[1:25:55] judah
[1:25:58] they got in and started saying
[1:26:00] y'all take a few days off
[1:26:02] we're gonna have a couple of holidays
[1:26:04] going on here y'all take a few days off
[1:26:06] just go party a little while don't come
[1:26:07] to church
[1:26:09] oh sorry
[1:26:11] then the people of the land weakened the
[1:26:14] hands of the people of judah and
[1:26:15] troubled them in building
[1:26:20] they didn't want
[1:26:21] the temple of god
[1:26:23] to be finished
[1:26:28] and hired
[1:26:29] preachers
[1:26:32] against them
[1:26:34] to frustrate their purpose
[1:26:39] you ever get frustrated
[1:26:41] once in a while once in the morning
[1:26:43] while in the afternoon
[1:26:46] and they hired counselors they didn't
[1:26:48] want this house bill
[1:26:50] the devil knows
[1:26:52] one thing for sure
[1:26:55] zerubbabel has come to show us how to
[1:26:57] build a temple
[1:27:00] and we
[1:27:02] have a commission
[1:27:04] from the king
[1:27:07] to build it
[1:27:10] amen
[1:27:11] how you like to i love this story i
[1:27:13] never read it really like that even when
[1:27:15] i was reading it
[1:27:17] let's go now to zechariah
[1:27:23] zechariah 4 verse 6.
[1:27:26] then he answered and spank unto me
[1:27:28] saying
[1:27:29] this is the word of the lord unto
[1:27:31] zerubbabel
[1:27:33] saying not by might
[1:27:35] not by power but by my spirit saith the
[1:27:37] lord of hosts
[1:27:38] now if you'll realize what happened
[1:27:41] during nehemiah's time when in ezra's
[1:27:44] time they didn't finish the temple
[1:27:48] through six church ages
[1:27:50] they didn't finish the temple
[1:27:52] that's right right
[1:27:55] they let the adversary get in and put a
[1:27:57] father-son holy ghost baptism in
[1:28:00] let a trinity come in
[1:28:02] let a know an eternal hell come in let
[1:28:06] uh wait a minute let's get in the
[1:28:07] message let a seventh under virtue come
[1:28:09] in let a no holy ghost doctrine come in
[1:28:11] let a seed doctrine come in let this
[1:28:14] doctrine come in what to confound the
[1:28:16] people
[1:28:19] and it finally came to a place to where
[1:28:21] they said stop
[1:28:24] give me a sword
[1:28:27] and give me a trial
[1:28:31] we're going to build this temple
[1:28:33] and they built it with a sword in one
[1:28:35] hand because the enemy did not want them
[1:28:37] to build that temple
[1:28:40] that's why it took 49 years to build
[1:28:43] that temple
[1:28:45] because they had to go out there and
[1:28:46] fight
[1:28:48] me and you 2 000 years
[1:28:51] it took a sword in one hand and a trial
[1:28:53] in the other
[1:28:55] to build this temple
[1:28:57] but they finally got it built amen amen
[1:29:01] this is the word of the lord unto
[1:29:02] jerusalem will say not by might nor by
[1:29:04] power but by my spirit saith the lord of
[1:29:06] hosts who art thou o great mountain
[1:29:13] o great mountain
[1:29:15] before zerubbabel thou shalt become a
[1:29:17] plane
[1:29:19] and he shall bring forth what the
[1:29:20] headstone
[1:29:22] not the cornerstone
[1:29:25] that zerubbabel
[1:29:27] brought forth the headstone
[1:29:29] not the cornerstone
[1:29:32] theref therefore with shouting crying
[1:29:34] grace
[1:29:35] grace unto it moreover the word of the
[1:29:36] lord came unto me saying
[1:29:38] the hands of zerubbabel have laid the
[1:29:40] foundation of this house
[1:29:43] his hands shall also finish it
[1:29:48] god's got no hands but your hands
[1:29:53] and thou shalt know
[1:29:56] do you know tonight
[1:30:00] and thou shalt know
[1:30:03] that the lord of hosts
[1:30:05] hath sent me
[1:30:07] unto you
[1:30:10] what brother daryl say
[1:30:12] god
[1:30:13] speaking through human flesh again
[1:30:16] do you believe that amen for who hath
[1:30:19] despised the day of small things but
[1:30:21] they shall rejoice and shall see the
[1:30:23] plummet in the handles of rubble
[1:30:26] with these
[1:30:27] seven
[1:30:30] church ages
[1:30:32] they are the eyes of the lord now
[1:30:34] brother iran's going to explain that
[1:30:35] with this quote and we'll stop right
[1:30:36] here musicians get ready to come when i
[1:30:38] read this quote they are the eyes of the
[1:30:39] lord which run to and fro
[1:30:42] through the whole earth
[1:30:45] all right let's read this right here
[1:30:48] number seven
[1:30:49] the message of grace
[1:30:52] we are all acquainted with this
[1:30:53] scripture now y'all come when when i get
[1:30:55] finished reading this we are all
[1:30:56] acquainted with this scripture that
[1:30:57] reads the bible we know that this was
[1:31:00] during the time of the preparation of
[1:31:02] the restoration of the temple i will
[1:31:04] restore saith the lord the son of man
[1:31:06] will be risen again there's going to be
[1:31:08] a body built amen
[1:31:11] and zerubbabel was a great prince
[1:31:13] amongst the people
[1:31:16] who had laid the foundation of the
[1:31:18] building
[1:31:19] now i want you to put on your spiritual
[1:31:22] thinking now watch spiritual thinking
[1:31:24] anointing jacket
[1:31:26] this morning or this evening as we think
[1:31:30] and this great prince had determined to
[1:31:33] rebuild the house of the lord
[1:31:35] and when he did he had laid the
[1:31:37] foundation stone now watch
[1:31:39] as we read on further we found out that
[1:31:42] god said zerubbabel has laid the
[1:31:43] foundation with his hands he also shall
[1:31:46] bring forth the headstone i want you to
[1:31:48] notice he never said he shall bring
[1:31:50] forth a cornerstone
[1:31:54] paul irene this martin
[1:31:57] columba
[1:31:59] luther
[1:32:00] wesley
[1:32:01] pentecost
[1:32:03] that wasn't jerubal
[1:32:08] he never said he shall bring forth a
[1:32:10] cornerstone it was already laid
[1:32:13] he shall bring forth the headstone
[1:32:16] and we know that the scripture says that
[1:32:18] jesus is the chief chief's cornerstone
[1:32:21] and he's also the headstone now if we
[1:32:23] will think for a few minutes now watch
[1:32:25] that this seventh church messenger
[1:32:28] boy just pops it right in there
[1:32:30] this seventh church aged messenger now
[1:32:32] we know who that was
[1:32:34] was to restore the faith of the children
[1:32:37] back to the fathers in other words
[1:32:39] rebuild the church again
[1:32:42] under the power of the spirit now
[1:32:43] rebuild the church he's not at the
[1:32:45] headstone yet rebuild the church

[1:32:55] how do we set up a church i'm sorry if
[1:32:56] we go this long but how how can we set
[1:32:58] up how do we set up a church
[1:33:01] we're going to read congress order and
[1:33:02] doctrine
[1:33:03] because the rubric told us how to do it
[1:33:06] we want to if we want to elect deacons
[1:33:08] we go back and see and read and read the
[1:33:11] book
[1:33:11] election of deacon
[1:33:14] brother brandon what do we do if a child
[1:33:16] is unruly
[1:33:18] deacons go to the parents
[1:33:20] you understand what i mean
[1:33:22] deacons are what this is this sure
[1:33:24] pastor's supposed to do this
[1:33:26] this one's supposed to do this trust
[1:33:27] he's supposed to do this we're supposed
[1:33:29] to do this as a body
[1:33:30] zerubbabel has told us how to put this
[1:33:33] thing back together
[1:33:36] and we're a recipient of it
[1:33:39] excuse me
[1:33:41] rebuild the church again
[1:33:43] under the power of the spirit not by
[1:33:44] power not by might but by my spirit
[1:33:46] saith the lord
[1:33:47] not by organization not by denomination
[1:33:50] but by the holy spirit god will bring
[1:33:52] forth the church in the last days
[1:33:54] zerubbabel the prince with joshua was
[1:33:57] the one that was to bring forth this
[1:33:59] headstone he had laid the foundation he
[1:34:02] took the people back to the foundation
[1:34:04] in type
[1:34:09] took them back
[1:34:11] restored
[1:34:15] the hearts of the what
[1:34:16] children babylon pentecostal babies
[1:34:20] to the faith of the father showing them
[1:34:22] this is the way the church is supposed
[1:34:24] to act
[1:34:27] let's put it together like this
[1:34:29] if we put it together like this brother
[1:34:31] brown what do we do if somebody raises
[1:34:33] up speaks in tongues
[1:34:34] in a service he says oh let them go
[1:34:36] first time or two because they're babies
[1:34:37] that's what he said
[1:34:38] he said but now if it keeps continuing
[1:34:40] happening i'm just paraphrasing if it
[1:34:41] keeps continuing to happen he said you
[1:34:43] need to go to that person
[1:34:45] take a deacon to that person or take a
[1:34:47] preacher to the person say take him in
[1:34:49] the back room and say hey if you need to
[1:34:51] give a message you need to give it now
[1:34:54] he was putting everything back together
[1:34:56] because pentecost had just want to stand
[1:34:59] up and speak in tongues
[1:35:02] daddy went to a church one time where
[1:35:04] you just go in and on wednesday night or
[1:35:06] wherever they went everybody just kind
[1:35:07] of does this
[1:35:11] and you waited on god to speak through
[1:35:13] somebody
[1:35:14] what a confusion
[1:35:18] because you might get a woman stand up
[1:35:21] i got a word from the lord that's okay
[1:35:24] but you ain't preaching
[1:35:26] not in this church
[1:35:28] brother brown said no
[1:35:30] you have a pastor he's the head
[1:35:33] you have deacons elders
[1:35:35] he put the church back together
[1:35:37] and wha my question tonight what are we
[1:35:39] doing about it though
[1:35:41] did we just say oh zerubbabel that looks
[1:35:42] pretty good we're going somewhere else
[1:35:45] i ain't talking about this church i'm
[1:35:46] talking about the bride
[1:35:48] the bride body around the world
[1:35:50] what are we doing with it
[1:35:52] we've been given all this material
[1:35:56] and as i as we see our brothers that
[1:35:59] tell us that
[1:36:00] we don't need any
[1:36:02] teaching
[1:36:08] like i said before
[1:36:12] for them to say that
[1:36:15] means they have a lack of teaching
[1:36:19] what me brother claude was talking about
[1:36:21] it's you know if you say if a drug
[1:36:23] what's the first thing a drunk tells you
[1:36:25] i'm not a drunk
[1:36:27] right and that's the first i'm not drunk
[1:36:30] right
[1:36:31] how many of you had to drink tonight 2
[1:36:33] 100
[1:36:36] no yeah none how do you know
[1:36:39] police officer stopped you how many of
[1:36:40] you had to drink up
[1:36:42] one
[1:36:44] right one beer
[1:36:46] you see what i mean
[1:36:48] we've been given the truth
[1:36:51] this frivolous thing that's going on
[1:36:53] around the world and around the message
[1:36:55] let it shed off it's just nothing but
[1:36:58] the adversary
[1:36:59] trying to keep you from building the
[1:37:01] temple of god
[1:37:04] because i promise you when the temple of
[1:37:05] god is being built god will come to that

[1:41:56] well let's reverse that
[1:41:59] let's take it off
[1:42:01] every promise of god
[1:42:03] you know i was reading the other day and
[1:42:05] we we try to and we do we try to build
[1:42:07] faith up sure we do
[1:42:11] but brother brown said any
[1:42:15] in other words a positive
[1:42:17] mental attitude mental
[1:42:20] toward god's promise
[1:42:22] will bring it to pass
[1:42:24] that's why that prostitute could walk up
[1:42:26] on that platform and just say i believe
[1:42:29] what that man says and got a healer
[1:42:31] but a christian would walk up on the
[1:42:33] platform and get in front of brother
[1:42:34] branham and get in front of the presence
[1:42:37] and go
[1:42:40] i wronged my neighbor
[1:42:42] i run out in front of this guy they see
[1:42:44] all these things the devil starts piling
[1:42:46] it on a child of god
[1:42:48] in her mind and brother brown said they
[1:42:50] don't get their healing
[1:42:53] well i don't want us all to be
[1:42:54] prostitutes but we ought to come up and
[1:42:55] just say i believe what he said
[1:42:58] and say well
[1:43:00] no here we go the adversary
[1:43:02] the adversary will come
[1:43:04] and try to destroy your
[1:43:07] whatever
[1:43:08] your healing your salvation
[1:43:10] your walk with god
[1:43:12] but you know what
[1:43:14] they
[1:43:15] built that temple
[1:43:20] god's building the temple now
[1:43:22] and he will have a building belt
[1:43:26] whether we want it or not
[1:43:28] somebody is going to stand up with a
[1:43:30] trial in one hand and a sword in the
[1:43:33] other hand and say come on
[1:43:36] we'll fight you with one listen they
[1:43:38] were fighting with one hand putting mud
[1:43:41] on the wall and one hand that must've
[1:43:42] been pretty good
[1:43:45] usually it takes a couple of hands to
[1:43:46] beat but no they did it with a trial and
[1:43:49] once what they did it with the word of
[1:43:51] god
[1:43:52] they believed in that sword they had but
[1:43:55] they also believed they had a work to do
[1:43:58] now you go the same way
[1:44:00] you go the same way believing god's
[1:44:02] given you the word and he gave you a job
[1:44:04] to do right
[1:44:06] and you're standing in the middle
[1:44:09] hello
[1:44:10] are you going to accept that challenge
[1:44:13] i pray that you do let's bow our heads
[1:44:15] dear heavenly father thank you for this
[1:44:16] day that you give us
[1:44:18] lord i'm sorry that we kept them so long
[1:44:20] but we've got a desire lord that we all
[1:44:22] see
[1:44:23] that we do have a job to do
[1:44:25] and that we're continuing on lord
[1:44:27] be in anything that comes what come what
[1:44:29] may we're going to continue on lord with
[1:44:32] that sword and trial lord we're going to
[1:44:34] build this house of god
[1:44:37] satan cannot defeat it because you said
[1:44:39] he couldn't
[1:44:41] and now i pray that what has been said
[1:44:44] tonight
[1:44:46] will go deep into the heart of the
[1:44:47] believers
[1:44:49] and that they'll believe who they are
[1:44:50] not who they're going to be but who they
[1:44:51] already are
[1:44:53] that their christ made manifest in
[1:44:55] another form
[1:44:56] called
[1:44:57] a bride

[1:45:25] churches in guildsville to let us borrow
[1:45:26] their
[1:45:27] baptismal pool
[1:45:29] if we do that baptismal pool will not
[1:45:31] ever be the same i'll promise you that
