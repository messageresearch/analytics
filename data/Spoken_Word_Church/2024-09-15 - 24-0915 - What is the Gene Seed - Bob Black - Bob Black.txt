TRANSCRIPT
========================================
there we go um we had a wonderful time at The Minister's meeting yesterday praise God I mean it was really good I mean it was we had I really really enjoyed it and uh and a couple times I thought a Revival's about to break out but um yeah we had uh I I think I think a lot I I just so many good things were said and so many little nuggets that you can just take and and pack away with you but I thought this morning I could just take the topic and that we were looking at and and just kind of study it out and meditate on it so let's go to the Lord in prayer Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word today I pray God that you'll prepare our hearts Lord for what you have in store for us help us Lord that you'll strengthen us through your word to express these things in our lives Lord Jesus to give us power over the enemy I pray God that you'll just be with us today we pray in your name amen so the the thought that we were meditating on yesterday was um about the gene seed and so um just just to maybe I I just really slowly go through some of these thoughts um uh somebody yesterday made a point that you you know really to the the message warrants us really sitting alone and thinking about things you've got to really just carve out time to think about these things and just meditate on it or or you're really not going to get anywhere um it's it's just really not sufficient to just come to church and and for an hour you you hear things and that that would be enough but uh you really got to for these things to really be Quicken to us you've got to sit and think about it and so that's what I want to do maybe for the next 20 minutes or so and and I'll try to leave some time for the musicians to come up here and kind of have a nice segue so um but just take our time and just think about some of these some of these thoughts so in Romans 9:13 it says at is as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated and then Genesis 25:23 and and Romans is actually quoting from Malachi but um Genesis 25 tells us that story where the Lord said un uh their their mom do two nations are in thy womb and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels and the one people shall be stronger than the other and the Elder Shall Serve the younger now you think about the nature the let's take a think about the nature of God that he knew in advance he already had the thought of what was happening what was going to happen and so he' already he could already say say Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated why that seems like an unfair statement to make doesn't it before they're even born God has already decided I love Jacob but not Esau why is that and you think all the all the way down bring it all the way down here there's been people in every age where he was like I I love that person and it's based on their response that God could look at and you God can look all the way down through time and see everything that's going to unfold and see your reaction and another words he's he's he's looking at you he he knows you so that's that's what we want to just Ponder is that God knew you God knew Jacob and God knows you God knows everything about you he knews everything about everything and um I was really just sitting pondering this morning that we we try to express with our little peanut brain these these things are almost past understanding how a God that passes our understanding we're try to articulate these things but to think how how can we are even articulate that before we'll say before the foundation of the world but but but before there was anything before there was anything at all that was expressed God knew you yes God knew how many times you would bat your eye how many times that you would how many times you'd pray how many times you'd come to church and and whether or not you wanted to go to church and he knew whether or not You' want the the word he knew you yes he knew you so he knew Jacob and Jacob was in his thoughts and and maybe that the thought that we're trying to get here is that that that the life that we're living right now is the thought that God had before the foundation of the world that's right that's what Peter was expressing on the day of Pentecost when he said this is that this is I'm identifying this right here with that that God thought of before the foundation of the world and he expressed it in Joel that I'm going to pour my spirit out on our flesh and so forth and so we can I when we begin to identify ourself how do how do we identify with oursel with the with with the thought is we look into the expression of the thought the word of God and we identify our life with the the word of God with all these stories with all these other Expressions it's like looking in a mirror and you begin to identify and you begin to recognize that where I am right now matches up with God's thought and and that that some of the brothers had some really really wonderful things to say about how identification is what gives you power it gives you uh Jesus was able to um that's what gave him power of the devil cuz he knew who he was and when you begin to identify yourself back but let's let's meditate on think about think about the nature of God that God is infinite yes he's all knowing he knows now this is where it almost blows our mind to think about it he knows everything yes everything he knows how many time the N is going to B it's he knows he knows what you're thinking right now he knows how many time you're going to tap times you're going to tap your toe and that's why that's why he could know that Jacob was going to Value the birthright over the Len soup that Esau would rather take Len soup over the birthright you think about that's unfathomable that Esau not know what the birthright was same thing today people not know what the gospel brings and yet he knows he knew Jacob's reaction and he knows your reaction yes he knows he knows whether you want it or not he's infinite he is all knowing even before the foundations of The World God knew every action am and decision of every individual now you know maybe maybe to frame up four knowledge I think I used to I I I would look at it as like God's looking at every possible action you could take if it was presented differently this way or that way then you know he's looking at all the different permutations but really he I think brother Brandon framed it up as he's looking at you as an individual and he knew that no matter where he put you whether it was uh whether it was in on the rack in the Middle Ages or whether it was in a Coliseum or a lion's den or a fiery furnace no matter where it put you that you would always respond to the word no matter where he put you and that's um I I use the example brother BR said if you want to see how you would have responded in any other age then look how you respond in this age so if he took you and transplanted you into the days of Martin Luther or the days of John Wesley or the zza Street or wherever he put you he knew you and he knew if you would respond now that's getting into for we got to understand forn knowledge to understand predestination because predestination is based on forn knowledge he's looking down through time to see you amen are you going to want it enough right are you going to want it enough to persevere through um Through Fire and furnace and like the Believers in the Middle Ages did put them on the ice sheet in the middle of winter but they wanted it enough to not give up and he knows and and and it's it's a because he can look down through time and know you it's an immutable thought that can never change now that's how substantial this thought is that he it's not like God is having a different idea I think that if this happens then we this will happen it's it's an immutable unchanging thought it's an eternal thought because God's thoughts are Eternal so that means that God always thought about you if you are going to come to life he always thought about you you are always a integral part of his thoughts that's right so God is infinite and and he exists Without Limits yes this is another thing that's really hard for our little peanut brains to comprehend but he exists outside of time so he never had a beginning and he never had an ending he's never going to have an ending so that's where we can we we can have confidence yes that he sees he sees all the way down through the string of time forever and ever and ever he knows everything that will ever happen yes sir everything that ever did happen and everything that ever will happen and that's why he can he know that's how he can know you and and and uh and we can place the thought that he had of of us in such a it's such a firm foundation that there's it it how can we even express it there's no changing to that thought in other words if I could be bold Bob black was always in his mind and you were always in his mind yes sir he always knew you he always knew that you were going to want it just like Jacob amen and God cannot make mistakes he can't grow any wiser or improve over time because he's already perfect in every sense there's no there's no there's no changing there's no well it it would be a better decision if I'd go with Esau over Jacob or in this case no it's just constant he knows Jacob if he could change advance or correct himself he would not be infinite and God is eternal which means that anything that had a beginning must have an end but God never had a beginning and so he has no end he exists beyond the boundaries of time like brother BR said he never begin he never will end amen God is omnipotent omnipresent and omniscient he knows all things all places all times all all powerful he is aware and I'm going to get to it I know probably some of y'all thinking Omni presentent hold on a second he is aware of every event thought and action in the universe yes he's aware of everything you can go on the moon and he knows how many times the astronaut is going to step his foot on the moon he knows he knows how many times everybody's going to take a breath I to think about that that he knows everything about everybody and that is how he can predestinate that is how he can know he can know how to set things in order because he knew Jacob at that level and brother Brandon would say he's omnipresent because he's omniscient he knows everything because he's infinite being infinite makes him omnipresent so now he's he's because he's a being that next quote he's not like the wind he is a being he's he's a being so he's not omnipresent in that sense but because he knows everything it's it it gives him that same quality of being there because he knows it he knows everything his infinite knowledge allows him to be fully aware of and present in knowledge to everything happening in his creation yes so he know he knows about your pet that just died or he knows about your children he knows about every single situation he knows about that little this little critter here that um how many times it's going to Blink its eyes and when it's going to metamorphose into its next stage and how many of those little pollen things it's going to eat or whatever it is he knows everything and he cannot make a mistake when God acts his decisions are Eternal and cannot change if God has ever called on the scene to make a decision on something brother Ram said his next decision has to be the same thing and every decision he ever makes thereafter has to be the same and you can use that to actually actually discern and and understand God and interact with God because if he if he gave something to somebody in a particular situation you can put everything you can put all your confidence that you if you can approach him in the same way you can get the same thing right if somebody else got the holy ghost or somebody else got healing you come the same way because if he acted one way to somebody else he's got to act the same way to you if you approach approach him with faith the same way he's going to respond the same way and he cannot change now really what we're talking about is identification that you know you can look and see that God is going to always always manifest himself the same way he's going to behave the same way because he cannot change in every age he manifests himself with the same characteristics his nature is the same his thoughts are the same and what are we talking about really the thoughts are expressed now in you and I and the thoughts are like the genes of God that are expressing in us and you so you can recognize God moving in a congregation or in someone's life because of those characteristics and the nature expressed in that individual or in a church or in the congregation and those same characteristics will be expressed in the bride in this last day how do we know cuz he's always the same he's the same in every age he acts the same way and when he was walking on the shores of G Galilee as the son of man he's going he acts the same way that he will when he's manifested as the son of man in the here in the end time he cannot change that's right and what is the manifestation of the son of man it's manifesting the thoughts the genes of God the thought that he had before the foundation of the world it's actually expressing those thoughts just like he had a thought about Jacob and that thought was expressed and now those same thoughts are being expressed here right it's for knowledge know what you would do now think about that millions of eons of time ago before you could even quantify it as some kind of an element of time that God knew what you would do and that's what for knowledge is yes go back back back as far as far back as you can go before there was even anything and already God knew what you would do yes there's a quote where brother R said today God knew that I would be standing behind the pulpit yes sir and he knew that you would be sitting out there in the Pew and he knew just like he knew Jacob he knew whether you would have wanted or not and that's what he's basing predestination on he knows if you want it then your whole that makes the everything change your whole life is structured in a different way CU he knows he knows in advance that you're going to want it and so he can predestinate he can have a preacher there right when you're going to hear it he can have uh uh even so much as breeding this one to this one down down to make sure that you come because he knows you're going to want it his for knowledge knowed what you would do so for knowledge speaks to God's omniscient ability to know the future before it ever happens I think he he knows about trolley cars he knows about every stage of mankind he knows about the invention of the locomotive and and Astron not knows but knew he knew all of that would unfold right God for and his forn knowledge allows him to understand people's characters now this is where we're getting at Jacob his forn knowledge allows him to understand people's characters their inclinations and their responses to Divine matters even before they are born now what we're getting at is I I it seems like we're belaboring the point but but God knew you and that made you a thought in God's mind an eternal thought something that an inescapable thought yeah like he because he knew you there's no running away from it he knew he knew you and he knew you would come to it and so now now you can you're living this life where the life of God has been manifested in you and you are the living embodiment of that thought the thought that God thought about is expressed in you now it's actually expressed and and it's and how is it expressed because a a word is a thought expressed right so we can say that the thought expressed actually expresses the thought that God had before the foundation of the world that's right in other words that when you hear the word it's actually bringing expressing out what God knew about you before the foundation of the world that you were in other words eternal life brother R would say by for knowledge he knowed what you would do by forn knowledge he knew that Esau was a Shyer and he knew that Jacob respected that birth right so forn knowledge includes knowing who will bear the character of Christ and who won't Hitler sure wouldn't he go through all these example Esau sure didn't balam sure didn't it looked like they were going through the motions balum with all of his seven seven altars and all of the all of the mechanics in place right and all of those thing uh Cain with uh wanted to go to church and wanted to come find an approach to God and he was trying to do it as far as his intellectual ability but God knew who would want it and who would who who would who would respond to the call of God and Romans 8: 29 he says for whom he did Forno and we'll stop on this slide and and just kind of transition if the musicians going want to go ahead and come forward for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren and Ephesians 1 says according as he ha chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will all this was planned out before the foundation of the world Amen and in other words there's a Target in your life a trajectory in your life that he knew that you would come to in 2 Timothy veres 1-9 he said who has saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began and 2 Thessalonians says but we are bound to give thanks always to God for you Brethren beloved to the Lord because God hath from the beginning chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth how did he choose us he choose he chose us because he knew us and he knew what we would do with the word when it dropped into our path and therefore he could have it ready for us to think to think about that that God knew you not just that he knows you but he knew you God bless you Saints [Applause] [Music]
