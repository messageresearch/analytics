TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign foreign baby mama God my heart and breathe instead always already gone praise God Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart My Heart Lord but in the house of the Lord so if you like turning your scriptures turn when we've been reading from Revelations one damn Revelations 8. now there's many sicknesses among this many things you know that you just keep praying about many different ones that are just the old flu bug and pain sister Esther's got it another uh Richard Marlow's got it by the day he was his life was real sick so remember all of these and just you know keep them in your prayers sister Glenn hurt her back and everything so remember that it's just a Gales got to go for some tests so there's a lot of sickness Among Us gives a lot of things to pray about and the Lord would bless and guide each and every one now we hope that everything's comfortable we've got to do this morning more men in here if you get cold let us know we'll try to look up a heater or something but it's not our problem this system is down and they'll do it and also while I'm saying that to those that are on the Internet it's not our problem here about the internet if you're connecting on today and it's not been our fault it's been the the supplier and they're having troubles with their internet system a big crash of it so you know just to pray to the Lord we bless and we we're hoping that everything is getting back to normal brother Joe said we were up and running today so that that's a good thing to remember to pray one for another one Remember The Minister's meetings will ministers meeting will be here this coming Saturday any of the ministers wants to come and be with us and we're still on the uh I think it'll be on the six-fold purpose and showing the Plan of Redemption so remember that and come and be with us and just have a good time in the Lord 11 o'clock I'm not sure I'm not sure if you didn't have to wait all right the end of fellowship meeting will be the third Saturday on the 19th it will be over at brother longorius and if you uh want to go with us let us know where we can make arrangements ahead of time and get everything ready to go in in going over that way probably leaving you somewhere in the neighborhood of 11 o'clock so we're gonna just get everything together and everybody can know it we will not be having a a bible study this month I called everybody yesterday I hope nobody didn't forget and come on up who called everybody basically that had been attending the Bible study and letting you know that we was not having it uh the agriculture I just really we just forgot to announce it so we would be having one in February and I will just put it off because we got too many things for the rest of the month hope you enjoyed this past weekend yeah amen and all with brother Jackson and everything preaching for the weekend had a real good time in the Lord sitting around talking fellowship and and all like that so we appreciate it amen Revelations 1 and Revelations 8. the heavenly father we thank you this day for your love and your grace unto us and we thank you for Calvary thank you for all things thank you for loving us and caring for us Lord thank you for guiding us we just ask you now that you come on the scene and speak to our hearts and our lives today that we may be what you want us to be and Lord teach us to wait because in that we learn patience and guidance in life and all Lord and in your word we just ask you to have your way now bless the little bride around the world because that was your promising to us and just hasten today we're in a new year a new time we've never been this way before so we may we buckle up a little closer and walk more into the light of your love we love you and we thank you we commit it all to you now in Jesus name Revelations 1 and we'll go to Revelations 8 1. the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass it's ending signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written that are in for the time is at hand Revelation 8 1 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour you may be seated Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now to you that come up and use the microphones and the thing up here in the the center we anchored it down where it wouldn't be movable we've been turning it down and just breaks loose the connections that goes down into the to the lookup so we we're just leaving it we fasten it down to where you can bend it a little bit backwards and bend this and do everything but it doesn't bother me anyway maybe we get somebody short when we'd be all right but it doesn't bother me at all so remember that huh now I want to just say this as we're approaching this understanding our thoughts that we've been on the Book of Revelations we've gotten over to Revelations 8 1 and mayor dining and we see that there's silence in heaven about the space of half an hour all right then knowing that you know a man has tried to figure that out how many days how many minutes how much it'd be and but why we're trying to worry about it because it talks about silence in heaven and don't talk about anything on Earth Here whatsoever it says there's silence in heaven for this place of half an hour well see the people of the message they kind of figure out the idea that uh well we know what six of the seals are and uh but we don't know what the Sabbath is well that's what I've been trying to deal with is to express to you what I see the seals reveal and it's supposed to be the revelation of Jesus Christ all right now it's not supposed to be some man or some idea or God or whatever is supposed to be the revelation of Jesus Christ all right and in doing that then in breaking those things down and what was our thoughts of how that we saw the the seals is because that God had sent us a prophet right to express those things all right unto us and as he expressed him he told us what the the seals were and and things and uh you know then when you come over to the seventh seal the everybody just kind of goes Haywire because they don't use the same example as you use for each one of the seals because we didn't know what the first seal was right but we couldn't read the wild horse rider yeah we could do that I'll get back to that in a minute we could read those things because it's written in the word well now you can read White Horse Rider red horse rider black horse or a pale horse or you know they'll seal Jew and tribulation and all and all of those things you can read them and because of the Prophet bringing us the message and explaining those things to us then we can have a uh greater concept of what those things bring but why not use the same example to enter into the seventh seal of the silence in heaven we must Depend and that was the last message I tried to bring you know we must depend upon that God sent a prophet amen right right I mean we haven't come six seals and and depended upon God's sin and the prophet then get to the seventh sealed and and try to figure it out ourselves because we couldn't figure out the first one all right you couldn't figure out the second third fourth fifth sixth so why would we have any thoughts of trying to approach this outside of the same example that we use on each seal and one of the things I've emphasized is is the point that the seals sure they're the reveal the Plan of Redemption all right I don't know they're dealing with the Redemption to Israel as the biggest percentage of what's doing but we looked at those seals to see what they meant to us right in our lives so you thought they were going to be in a tribulation period no but tribulation work with patients all right so we can look back and see those things and realize what it has to do with our lives because that's what we need the Plan of Redemption and we don't need just to plan a Redemption for Israel right right that's well and good but we need the Plan of Redemption for ourselves amen because as you and I that are concerned with it but I hope you understand what I've been trying to do now I'll repeat it again Carter I want you to understand that if we have to depend upon the profit for one two three four five six you know oh the seals to bring an understanding to us then we have to depend upon him to bring us the understanding of the seventh seal all right all right then when we see what his understanding is I mean then we can see what it has to do with you and I all right so that's basically what I've been trying to do is cover those things to be able to to you know look at the word and see the word unfold right all right and see ourselves amen all right now I hope you caught one point I tried to make is we we talk about the the CEOs and the silence in heaven under the seventh seal well see I told you I believe that the first seal is silent until God revealed amen we'll find out a little later that when we get to it with the prophet maybe this afternoon that those seven Thunders is what's holding the revelation of those seals right it's not in addition to the book it's got to be in the book amen all right you can't do that you can't add two right but we have to have it revealed yes now my wife and I are talking about it the other day you know that the and I don't mean to say anywhere any college in the United States I know that the Oral Roberts University is supposed to have a copy of brother branham's message that's my understanding if they don't have it then I my understanding is wrong so I just say any college you know that any college any church any group of people any pastor they could read the Bible before the prophet came right right that's right and the seals was written in the book and they could read that and they had their own thoughts and ideas about what those things meant right right all right but we know that that didn't bring the revelation but now I don't have a seal book I just hold up a songbook but see now you could take a seal book but you could give it to anybody in the world you know their languages or whatever have to be considered but any college any church anywhere could read to see a book and explain the seals to you sure absolutely you're wanting to do it now understand me but I'm saying it can be done all right right amen see because they're not going to break down and do what somebody else but just suppose they're honest enough people to say well okay uh let's see what this man said they could explain the seals from reading the book right that's right they could explain the opening of the seals because of the reading of the book of the prophecy and that way they could understand the white horse rider sbnb Antichrist that they could take those things and come right down to the end and even quote to you the things that are written or the prophet of what he says the seventh seal is right he said well what's your point my point is one thing we think because we read we think because we have a book we can read a book we're blessed amen right amen but anybody can order a book that's right anybody can get a book anybody that has any education can read right because we read the Bible before the prophet absolutely come along amen and I told you the Badness used to preaching a little out of the Sixth Seal of the you know chapter six there because they could understand that that was a tribulation period all right but has it been revealed amen well that's it okay there's the difference between what I'm talking about he said well we've got the word all right right we've got the word we've got it in our hands we got the ability to read or listen to takes or whatever if we can't read we can say that we know what the seals are well you know come on am I right that's right those are the ability to have within our possession right we could say we know what that is right but has it been revealed to you tonight what do you mean that I face ministers in this message what do you mean reveal we've got the word right we've got the prophet's word well amen that said anybody could make a speech anybody could explain the first seal if we would just read the book and say it's not the Holy Spirit it's the Antichrist Clarence Larkin said that was what it was before brother random come along right but did that make him a prophet no he was a straddle of the horse right maybe or maybe it was the horse that's it Antichrist was riding on that right you know in other words he had to adopter that's right all right so you see then it's not revealed just because we read it right what we read and what we study on and meditate must come forth as a revelation all right see then once we do that see then it'll bring forth the book will come out we'll become open right now get to that this afternoon did we say the book is open but according to Revelation 10 4 is something wrong right because your Prophet said it's still with those seven Thunder that's Revelation 10 14. 99 which verse it is but do we understand well brother Dale you just blow my mind could I get it just about figured out that I think I know what I'm talking about and you come along and tell me I don't have it well then if that tears you up then you know what the problem is you don't have it that's right amen amen if not you say well he just don't understand you see until it's revealed right the prophet said you can make anything manifest that's revealed to you right to manifest something is not what we look at it as and it does that because it deals with it the signs and wonders but the main word of manifestation or manifest is to make known but see then you can make known to somebody else what you see and not just a white horse rider you know all right look can you see that white horse rider riding off and you standing here because that's what wrote around them so man he said there goes that Feller that guy that you know on that horse riding off see peace out something related to his own life right and that's what I'm trying to do now if you get you and I can look at the book study the book study what the prophet has to say of course you ain't gonna go to Greer's Almanac right we're getting Jamaica and going to get a McDonald's we're not doing that because it won't fit the word we'll get around to it and probably said if somebody thinks he has those Thunders it must compare with every scripture in the Bible all right so then that's why we depend on for God to reveal it see once it's revealed you don't have no problem you mean somebody could caulk you out your understanding of one God if they can this that's all you've got all right that's right you don't have a revelation you just got to understand it right that's right all right then I thought the Holy Ghost was the revealer of the word amen I didn't know no man could reveal it right I know a prophet is one who reveals the word of God and even the prophet said about him as to be one that is he reveals the part that's in his own life right all right but we know that Jesus couldn't reveal the word right around him and that's what I made an emphasis over and over all these 40 something years then we talk about the seventh she'll not even be written yeah we got the quote let's see then you mean to tell me that brother Brown could tell us something that Jesus couldn't tell us that's right that the Bible couldn't tell us so it's got to be in the word amen right so now we can read Revelation day one it's written in the word so now we don't have to worry about it the seven seal is in the word right right it's written in the word right right we could open the seven seal every silence in heaven because when we read Revelations six one it says that the lamb broke the first seal right and it was a wild horse rider rolled off well we could read it because it's written in the book right right but what we needed was to know what that was being said until then we we go to the prophet and we read what the prophet said amen and he explained to one horse rider and we can say well thank you Lord right but has it been revealed now wouldn't it be something for us to be sitting in a any kind of Church Catholic Baptist Methodist Presbyterian and say I believe them seals you know I believe that one more surrounded that Prophet told us that see the thing of behind the seal is to see where that white horse rider came from right and you'd find out it come from organized religion amen well now how can you stay there amen come on how can you stay there in organized religion and say you believe the word that's right that's right amen yeah well I believe what the prophet said that only makes sense right God if you believe it you couldn't go right Karen they're secret believers they were secret Believers in the days of the Lord Jesus that's right but them secret Believers didn't amount to much that's right it was when they came out into the open and professed or confessed their belief that's when the world went after him but see how can we send in this message and say we believe the prophet's message and people will sit in churches that are teaching that he was wrong right right right sure how could you do that well I don't have nowhere else to go you can always move that's right no I can't well you think more of where you're at than you do to move right come on be sensible all right you know years ago some here tried to get me to get a church down Atlanta they said that way the biggest portion of the people will be right around the church I said you ain't got but one problem I said you're dealing with an old goat that's going to make you decide what you want to do so you're gonna drive up here if you're going to hear because at least you'll have to make an effort you said well brother Dale that was kind of bad on you wasn't it might be but at least you proved you know if you were willing to drive just getting the point right instead of me driving to you you're willing to drive here because it wouldn't matter to me if this church was in Washington DC as long as we could get turned back yeah right right and whatever but you see God wants you and I to put forth an effort and we do that to travel and do things wow now get on with it but Stephen we come into the message and we we find so many different Avenues of going of the people of the message and they all claim to believe one message that's right but then they can straighten him out and correct him and all kind of things now I'm not going to get up here and tell you brother Brown was a prophet a mouthpiece of God and tell you how I'm corrected right now I got very little education but I got some sense you know that don't take education to be that you can be a dummy and have a photographic memory but I call a dummy is somebody that won't take correction for the word amen but you get what I'm talking about now I'm just trying to make a point because this is what I've been driving at see if we depend upon what he said for one two three four five six then the only way that we could come out with a sensual understanding is to approach the seventh seal as from what he said okay and he told us a lot of the things that the seventh sea level yes yes but neither one of them has added to the word that I've ever found and none of he said has added to the word because he always put us back in the word they said to him one day he said well brother random said you know with your ability you could write a 23rd chapter of Revelation he said he's trying to trap me for one thing and he said but so I told him so when I can't be done you can't add to the word right he said well what about them seven Thunders won't that be given to somebody he said no because you'd be adding to the word so the seven Thunders can't add to the word of God that's right amen it has to be in the word but something that light is not shined on because wasn't that the way that he approached the seals in the dream that somebody had of seeing the pyramid Mountain you know and it was interpreting that with your statue of perfect man and he was interpreting those things that were written and whipped off the top you know looked down in and I was the Seven Seals it's got to be in the word don't you ever get any thought about brother Dale saying that the one C or a seventh seal or any seal is not in the word of God that's right amen because you'd be adding two you know you know you could come out with like um Brother Gary I hope don't mind it but we were sitting in Rhymes one day I think it was eating I told you this before and Sister Margaret was sitting there and brother Gary was talking about all these people think that that polygamy is the great revelation of the seventh seal it's just a market she never did save her much you know talking but she made a good point she said if he can get that Revelation to polygamy you know get more wives and things the seventh see if I can get the Revelation I take my 357 blow his head off and I said sister I agree with you because it can you can get it to be one thing I can get it to be another that's right that's right but if we're going to depend upon the profit amen right to tell us all right now we're going to go through this I've been trying to get across you when you have company it's hard to just talk to people you know with company and different things and but see the approach we want to take is exactly the approach we've been taking that we must depend upon the profit to bring the Revelation amen all right then we must see what those things are under there under the seals no matter what number it is and then from that we must ask God to reveal it right because the letter of the page is not the revelation it cannot be contrary to the letter that's right right that's right there's no Revelation whatsoever can be contrary to the letter of the word you talk about written between the lines all you want to that's right but do you better have what's in between the lines better line up with what's on the line amen that's right amen the only thing brought around we're talking about in between the lines would like you can't read that Abraham and Sarah was turned back to a young man to young woman yes would you read between the lines and see that she went down there you know 100 year old grandma or something you know and the King wants to marry her that's the things that are written between the word that's right letter you know amen but he can't be contrary to the letter she couldn't go down there as somebody else's wife the letter said she was Abraham right let's see that's what I've been trying to approach and then then from that yeah let God speak to our lives right amen and to see what it has to do with us even though it may not pertain to us physically you know but yet we can look at it and see what it's speaking to our hearts and Minds because it is the Plan of Redemption I hope that that's been established amen that the Book of Revelations explaining the Plan of Redemption right all the seals are explaining the Plan of Redemption that's right now I've told you now I will get to it later I don't believe the seventh seal brings out a point of something short as redeemed because you know that way you can take it into the new birth and that's fine but the main thing to me about the seventh seal is if we'll get to it maybe this afternoon or next year one when we talk about it being his coming but the prophet said that's what it was then we're going to have to realize that coming has got to be to you and I think right and if it's to you and I then we've got to see our part about the Coney and then the prophet would come up to say he comes back after her do we know what to look for you remember the prophet one day said you know what to look for I pondered out a long time ago I didn't know what to look for but now we see that we need to look for the coming of the Lord to you and I right not the coming of the Lord to the world not to come to the Lord to anybody else right oh if we could just begin oh brother or sister so it's so straightened up we'd be ready to go no no no it's a personal matter but see he's going to come back is for us right so that's the part we need to understand all right but now it was not until the prophet spoke to us could we understand anything that's why I said and I made the statement that there's silence in heaven over what happened two thousand years ago in glory right right and until those seals are revealed it's still silent all right amen to a person that does not understand the seals by Revelation the seals are not broke thank you man that's right that's sensible what we need is a revelation right more than anything else all right now let's start see if we can get a little bit on the end of what we're trying to to cover now we read here that silence in heaven all right now listen to what I'm saying this tells me just as much as to read over here himself lamb wrote out you know I mean a a writer wrote out a white horse rider once that symbol is broken then I can see that Antichrist right right all right let's see this this over here is written just like that's written right we're gonna do it in a second it requires then that a prophet be here that's right so tell us what that means all right but now I hope you don't you don't get tired of me saying the same thing over again but this Prophet can't add to the word right right it's got to be what's in the word amen I believe it but as I said about whipping off the top of the period looking down here there was things in there that hadn't been lighted not shined on and then listen we found they were silence in heaven the angel stop Jeremy and stopped everything stopped why because it might give away the secret what was the secret The Secret of redemption amen amen what else is to be revealed that's right certainly it's not the White Horse rather be in the Antichrist that's what everybody said you said what's the first seal modern horse rider Antichrist no more Roberts University could tell you that in what page or something right yep that's right see that you understand my point of water bring it out while ago anybody can take the seal book and just read it and make a speech about it and say I told you just what the prophet said right see we need a revelation now I'm going to stay on this if I have to there's a whole message for you and I'll go to my notes in the evening Satan can read the book that's right he knows what the Blair says he knows what brother random taught he's got a photographic memory right that's right amen you know you ask him what did the problem first dealership white horse rider and cry see you asked the bad this message this Presbyterian what is that I don't know why because they've never had the silver broken right but you ask Satan I ain't gonna call him I spend more time talking to him I knew the Lord too just argue about how you won't do because you do too you want to admit it but see the devil you asked the devil today said what's the first seal he said well I was right well that used to be told it was the Holy Spirit he said no we know better now right well what is it it's the Antichrist right yeah she could tell you every letter of the word does that mean it's revealed to him yeah right right and even got born again it would be the devil no more I'm really sorry for him because he cannot be born again right here what are you listening yes yes amen see the devil can tell you everything right around him say it now back when it was in the days of the Lord Jesus turn these down with the bread you know get not the Lord thy God you know he only answered carnal things right right Ernest only bread I believe you can do it go ahead and turn these stones into bread it's something natural right but see he's not that dumb no more I tears him up but sorry to say anything it's not that dumb no more now according to the Bible Satan has Ministers of righteousness preachers that's right I scored the Bible and see a right a person that believes in righteousness is not a law teacher I'm trying to illustrate see he's getting away from the natural letter when he approached Jesus it was natural letter turn this to bread do this do that do see not anymore right the brother told me one time he said brother now be careful said the devil will hear you say that I said the devil heard right around saying right no problem he heard him say it that's right all right we think that we have but but if it's not revealed we have no more than what he had right right see then we can be swayed by greater matter when you're arguments or you know people talking and doing but now listen we read the things that Prophet had to say just like I've always challenged you of one thing you need to read and read and read and study and ask God to reveal because you give me anything brother random talk anything he said and probably by my memory I can give you a quote contrary to it you agree now you know brother random we'll get back to it in a little bit you know run around and talk it over and over you can't add to the Bible right he says here he's talking about the seventh seal he said it's not even written in the word oh wait think about that now if it's not written in the word and he tells you what it is that's an addition to the word right have you got you understand what I'm getting in all right if it's not written then he tells you what it is he added right but if it's in the word and you he gives you his revelation then it can be revealed to you right and you can have a revelation amen right now you hadn't added to the word at all right amen I heard a man one time said he his way back said he he was talking about law and Grace he said he went to lift one man and he heard it was really on on Grace and said boy he went Garden we've got tapes or whatever he done you know and he listened and he said they just ain't no way anybody could explain that any other way that's what it is he heard another man that spoke on the contrary part of law from trying to take like James going one way you don't call another we know he didn't but to try to take that because this was organizational people he said I listened to the other man and he said I was vastly confused he said because that man laid it down in a line that I couldn't argue with what he said so now there you're standing with one side going one way and one side going the other way what are you gonna do right well I'm just gonna stay in the middle be careful because it's kind of sharp in the middle you know kind of a peak right and all you got to do is lean just a little bit and you're going off and I'm just but you see there's only one thing that could take law and Grace and put it together and that's a revelation from God our intellect cannot do it amen right don't anybody else can argue the point right all right but listen go ahead and pull up number one on there paragraph 249 on the seventh seal and look what he says now why let us prove it one it is the secret that no one knows about yarn was forbidden to write about it even write a symbol about it come on this is why there was no activity in no acting in heaven activity in heaven it might give away the secret it's not appreciate it man it might give away the secret so if it's part of the Plan of Redemption you're dealing with Redemption right now listen plain language I like to put it this way they used to think that the seven Thunders with seven men that had each one had a thunder all right so you probably heard about those things but that would put it to where you could find that would make it something that the book is not making or the writing of it it'd be hard to keep a secret if you had seven names and seven people standing there because each one of those men were supposed to have a great Revelation to bring to us you know but he said he might give away the secret right another group of people around the message says the seventh seal is not broken they have quotes they said nobody can understand that seventh seal the prophet's got to come back and tell us what it is that's another group complete there's a slow groups of people that try to interpret that seventh seal but read it in simple language you might give away the secret welcome brother there's nothing there no that's not what your Prophet said that's right he said there's nothing written huh we'll go along on that but I wish you'd read the rest of that paragraph right in front of you it's so great it must be included no it's going to be included because it's got to happen so it's got to be included in your Revelation or you don't have a full Revelation and it's got to happen do we say the seven seal can't be revealed of nobody well now it's got to be included that's what your prophets is right and it's got to happen hmm all right so everybody's got a way of trying to interpret that right run down to the bottom if Satan should get a hold of it he might do great damage there's one thing he don't know now he can interpret anything he wants to now let's see it and impersonate any kind of a gift now come on if he can impersonate a gift right then as I said while ago the Bible says that Satan's got Ministers of righteousness amen to deceive with it brother Rob said he can give out Supernatural gifts all day long now you argue with him about it I'm just telling you what he's saying see when you say I don't see that I can't believe well then you're arguing he ain't arguing with me yes that's right why get mad at me because I found a quote he said I hope you learn but he can't know this but he's not even written in the word it's a total Secret the Angels everything shut up if they made one move it might heal something away so they just shut up quit harping everything stopped what I said a moment ago we have to tell you that wait a minute you can't add through the word right but there's nothing written it's the phrase there's silence in heaven now all we need to know is get a profit and depend upon him to tell us what that is right and totally depend upon him not not you know not something we do that we're we agree on one thing we'll agree six and seals is broke but won't agree on the seventh being broke or open you're doing what you want to say then your Prophet said you're only presuming right that's right to eventually without Authority so you're standing on the shaky legs look what he says paragraph number two there's another paragraph 48. and notice the Seven Seals hold Seven Seals holds the mystery of the book until we can see what those Seven Seals have sealed in we're only presuming them things that's the breach so he knew when he started that there would be a great connection and all of the seals would have to be revealed or you'd be presuming yep right well no no brother he just meant six seals well then he didn't say that right he said Seven Seals to be revealed all right go to the next one which is in the breach prayer 68. well that word Redemption until the day that the book of redemption has been revealed and a redeemer Redeemer nothing can do it don't grieve it they do do things that pleases God but the book is sealed now and you are sealed you don't hear that a lot tying together with the seals do you yep the holy spirit is the seal still signified in other words I got from dictionary it still signifies the finished work and when the seventh seal still be broken seventh seventh seal is broken the mystery of God that's sealed in these mystery mysterious seals is finished until the day that seal is broken then it's revealed what's on the inside of it if the man's wondering what's in the carbox you say it's supposed to be such and such that's supposed to be he's presuming but when the steel is broken and the door is open we see and do it then and see exactly what's there hey but I'll be done at the end time right presuming because you say I understand six of them don't understand the sound like you're presuming what about a prophet that would come through the seals and bring it out as the thus saith the Lord did you do that did you bring each seal as he may not use the words but they're there right that this is thus they have the Lord straight from God right right right amen and what about a thus saith the Lord but you're only presuming I don't make sense dude your Revelation don't never make sense sorry a revelation ain't never sensible but once it's revealed it's the only thing that is sensible right right but when you first looking at it there's nothing sensible about a revelation it's contrary what do you mean well we know even even that'll be the Apple it says it ain't the forbidden fruit you're saying it was sex so you're making them pervert or had those things so do you think but thanks but you're only presuming right and remember the book is sealed that's right and you're sealed with the book that's right we better want to know what the Plan of Redemption is yes God is that on the way that we can be redeemed amen right this is not going to church and being good that's right this is not those things but you're only presuming until the end time that's what he said yep right join the end time the Revelation comes forth what about those great men of the Apostle Paul and those writings and and yet without the opening of the seals you're standing with thus saith the Lord with no way to make it manifest yeah come on nowhere to bring it out and make it benefit that's why everybody's waiting on you and I right right amen everything's dependent upon you and I amen because if we don't come for it in a resurrection in a change in a sentient Rapture Etc then nobody goes to heaven that's right that's all totally dependent upon you and I all right well I'll tell you what I'd like to live out there right that's fine I would have too I'd love to bend my car but I'd rather be here right right well because we're down here in the NW but you see you're only presuming until the seventh seal comes forward right now we know for a certainty that's why I love it that way honey remember to stand here and say without the opening of the seventh seal we're only presuming about the other things because the prophet had to say it but then it's the same way I can stand here and say according to the Bible according to the prophet the seventh seal was broke now whether or not we know what it is that's that's irrelevant to the situation never went through a big old words are Don't Mean a Thing but since the seventh seal is broken then I'm not presuming right rightwise right what about a great revelation of all down through there and they're dependent upon you and I to get to the place that we say we're not presuming right yeah I don't like that people get together we get in these meetings and things well what's your input that turns me to smithereens I'd rather you get up and tell me that you believe your big toe is God and I gotta kiss it to go to heaven let me say what's your input when you say an input you mean when you say this is why it stands and if you're right you're not presuming anymore you remember the Irish scripture where it says I believe it was Peter said this is that amen now he wasn't presuming was he he had the goods and he said this is that they were spoken up by the prophets see we got to have it that way church and we're going to be in bad shape but see around the message they say the sentiment sealed is not broke well we read it and ate one it said and when he had opened the seventh seal right so the lamb that opened the first one opened the seven right all right we want people more to say as far as I'm concerned they would do that you didn't jump right up in your face hmm oh that's what the interface shouldn't say you think you know what the seven seal you know them Thunders tell me the new name of Jesus Christ be revealed in the Thunder we don't have to thinking about that the other day and I'm going to tell you the new name of Jesus now I can't leave Jesus right right are you listening yeah I'm just thinking no more you know how dumb we want to be if it's the new name of Jesus if you said the name of God to be revealed in the end time or something you could not connect it to Jesus but if it's a new name of Jesus now I'm going to tell you the new name of waydale there's no way in the world I can do away with his name right but he used to call him at school one one day the new name well that means I've got I've got to have late deal standing there or I'm telling you the new name of somebody else because you don't know who I'm talking about right and I'll go thank you Lord it's all right may not mean nothing to you let me go off to me Hallelujah if we need to know the new name of Jesus that means we can't leave Jesus out right okay I ain't worried about it probably shouldn't be made known it would be made known when we get there or whenever right whatever it is don't worry about it amen but now listen we read in the scripture let the Sabbath seal is broke right amen all right now go ahead with number four on the notes which is seven see in paragraph 241. he said win this seventh seal mystery in the book of redemption was broke open think of it but it's broke the lamb breaks it you know what they were all right I believe they didn't know all means you've come to a holy reverence of respect and you're standing all right but he says this bro but brother there you don't know over here this quote okay I'll be glad to give it to you but run around and said to seven see I'm not broke yet right it says it can't be made known to the public I could walk a little bit me but for you to say it's not broke you're a liar right amen of course the Bible says it the prophet says amen now to say you don't know what it is is the truth right right we know what it was we wouldn't say it wasn't broke because if we know what it is it's got to be broke I don't need a revelation does it that's right you can't get a revelation of something that ain't right I'm glad they finally put that in the dictionary the word ain't or I can use it all right but you see then it's got to be broke it's not whether or not we're dealing with words right I mean I had somebody you know that ain't in the message or book let's say would you mind reading that and they'd say well in the Sabbath see it was broke would you mind reading this quote from a man and see the Earth the seals broke all right that's it well what does that mean he said whatever what it was it got broke some way because it's open right you see no no no we're not supposed to reason things out brother Dale the Bible says come let us reason together right the Bible's the only thing that is reasonable amen now let's take this a little bit into something and just consider the point I'll give you these quotes before and we've been over them but I want to bring it down a little they're going to number five yeah hurry jump up to number six before you do number five option number six let's read it first this is question and answered on the seals he's talking about there's got to be a messenger not open to see it for us what's the first that first there's a messenger church next to see we find out the corruption that hits in the cemetery but the seventh seal doesn't reveal anything what's going to happen to it see one because at the end of that church Aid is to come a prophetic gift to reveal these things see are you father I wouldn't know the number or paragraph but you should know when it's in the seal book and when he says the seventh seal doesn't reveal anything what's going to happen you go to the end of the church that he's just become a prophetic gift I thought when we came through the seals and we got over to number five that the prophet covers emphatically that there's no need of a combat Beast right you remember that man you got your line me off the man the eagle the life is an eagle there's no need of another combat beats why because that was the seventh Church age Messenger right right seventh Angels seven thirteen manager right well see we don't need somebody to explain the field six and seventh seal to us why because the prophet is here to tell us what it is and there's no way anybody can explain it to us and the prophet can only give you his Revelation right he is revelation he can't give you a revelation and make him almighty God right so then we found out that there's no need of a combat beast on the fifth sixth and seventh seal why because it was a prophet a prophetic gifts to come down amen a prophet to explain these things to us right right so when we're done to the Sabbath we're standing just as we not if we didn't have to stand there on the one two three four but to get down to explaining it see we've got to have the prophet Messenger right so then whatever his Revelation is right that's the only thing me and you've got to go on if we go on our own Revelation right we sure have goofed it up amen right because we was goofed up I don't care who you are yes right that's right and what you claim the prophet is the one the word of God comes to amen now if you can straighten him out then come on down I want to kiss your toe because you'd have to be almighty God what you see I might buy to sucker if you come after I made that statement but I know you ain't God I know I ain't God he said we used to always talks with God not that way not that way right but we got to depend upon him so we take his word on the first seal at the white horse riders the Antichrist that was his revelation yeah right right amen we didn't know what that was we take what he said on the second seal of the red horse what is his revelation third fourth right come on lift when you get up to there nobody ever talked about that he said everything I've listened we were the other night to himself at sealed he said everything that I saw or thought I saw was contrary to what was revealed to me in that room that's right it was his Revelation that we stand on the fifth seal of the Jews and when it is it was his revelation of The Sixth Seal and the 144 000 in the Jews and the thing now where are we going we've got a silence you know that one time he said the original silence said him caught it with nobody up there I was in his earlier Ministry I'm not going to argue that he didn't say something but now listen I want to know his revelation yeah I got a couple years ago I used to brother I used to preach for him we were so close he'd eat in our home every other week whatever and I was preaching on this and I said the prophet said this is my Revelation I said let's see if my Revelation is the same as his revelation and the brother just cut me totally off never would have nothing else to do with me sent me a word he had a revelation that run around and had the revelation all I said was I had a revelation that run around in that Revelation I thought we said the same thing but it just didn't fit in his language me but now listen church we depend upon Him Amen brother Brown what about this silence we've depended upon you so far now we must follow that channel to depend upon you all right go ahead with number five now which is paragraph 2 45 of the seventh seal sorry I flocked that money anymore sometimes it messes up things I know now none of us know we'll have something man tell you nobody don't know and he says this is my revelation little I think says that now none of us know so this is my revelation come on but if his Revelation fits the Bible right it'd be correct that's right but his Revelation takes you contrary to the scriptures anywhere he's taking you to another God you remember that in the scripture if a man come and give you a sign and the sign come to pass but he takes you to another God in that scripture don't believe him he said cause I have sent it among you to try you read the scripture see God is trying you and I to see where we'll stay with the word that's why giving us 40 something years that's the going of the Prophet yes even Moses were down in Egypt because those people would have believed him they would have went up so they had to give him some time to make up their mind right and right around said they had to be crying out for a deliverer well our fat bellies and things ain't crying a whole lot brother sent me a note there the other day gave me a note he said the great secret of things is is we need to fast on them the first day of the week on Monday he said Monday is supposed to fast well according to him it would put us in the Rapture or put us in the I'd say it do us all real good right amen you know I agree but I don't think that's the message you know I I just don't understand it that way but now look and none of us know but I'm going to tell you in my my revelation of it all right so we're totally dependent upon his Revelation right but I like to say it again we totally dependent upon the first field for his Revelation so it's no problem he wasn't standing on Shaky Ground when he got down I hope everything's going to hold you up no right he got to the place he knew he wasn't presuming amen come on he was standing on his own Revelation and your own Revelation is only thing that will keep you from presuming as certain as I stand in the platform tonight and the Revelation that released now here's his Revelation he said he had it he's been a three-fold man I will speak old of it so now he's only going to speak of a folder okay let's go with our first here's the Revelation to begin with I want to tell you what that what it is what happened is that those seven Thunders that he had heard thunder and was forbidden to write that's what the mystery is laying behind those seven consecutive Thunder from now now depended upon his revelation we'll have to break it right now I don't want to say something to you and I'll repeat it this evening about five times maybe more the book is sealed in chapter four you don't find it until actually chapter 5. it's a seal book all right the lamb breaks the seals one two three four five six seven everybody adjust real quick and says yes that's right and over in chapter 10 the book is opened they're 10. you had a book in his hand that was opened nobody didn't know what that was because immediately in 10-4 right he was told to seal up what the seven Thunders said right so where are we going Books open books books closed Books open books closed you're looking at me like thinking well you use your Crossing yourself up no I'm saying just what he said I want to make one point to you and I hope you've been able to follow this for about 40 years because in all that's followed by the opening of the word Revelations 5 is in heaven right right amen it is not on Earth it is not at this time in manifestation upon the Earth Revelations 5 is a future event that's right remember John was taken up to heaven he didn't say he was taken up to the next day you know he was taken up to heaven Revelations 5 is in heaven but at this moment Revelations 5 is not a full manifestation right right I'll get back to it one of these days prove to you why that's in heaven the seals break in heaven maybe two thousand years ago wrote down by John I'm quoting right around because just get it to you he said then he has to hand it down to the seventh angel on Earth Revelations 5 is not a fulfillment yet right you said you wanted to happen John didn't go up to the year 2014 that's the day of the rapture he went up into a spiritual condition he was not there in a mortal body Immortal body would lay on Earth Revelations 5. is a future event because we're not there yet is that sensible yes yes until we're there it's not physical right oh now you can all do all you want to about the resurrect sitting in Heaven's place in spiritual conditional go ahead but I'm still looking at problems don't you right you know human beings right and we're not there yet and we can't be there until all the varieties gather together then she can sing the song of redemption you said well brother Dale you've always told us that's in heaven that's what exactly right it's in heaven right it's not on Earth do we talk about we're already there but we're still here the prophet said this is my revelation this is my Revelation he said I'm a musician my revelation and he said nobody knows it looked me but he's already got into the seals and realizing something's wrong getting wasting the matchers and he makes a great statement he said it's gone from here there's no way for you to know it you are because he knew about the questions he got like Wade was saying it's good morning the question he got was whether women should wear pantyhose or what they should do with father-son Holy Ghost correct or Lord Jesus Christ or right very little comment about what he's asking them to comment on the seals three years gone from the Windows 7 still opens he doesn't have any problems of knowing he's the only person standing in that building that day right that knew what that seal was but it was his revelation now all we got to do is find out what he said then God can reveal it to you not of course everybody know I know all about it the prophet told us many things about that seven seal that's right there was a secret foreign standing there and he said he saw his name Robert said have you seen your name you know listening a secret thing no one knows but the Bride of Jesus Christ there's no way for anybody else to know it right they don't have the ability so it's going to take a prophetic Prophet we agree with that new Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 Revelation 10 7. if you don't read a random it would take a prophetic people to understand we're trying to make some profit and I'm trying to make you one all right let's solve the problem right I'm trying to tell you who you are and what you're doing right right amen yes sir we are the Bride of Jesus Christ he said on Azusa Street a prophetic Prophet came down the Holy Ghost came himself he said and why can't we believe we're a prophetic people that can't believe the impossible amen red book 87 in red book you might have a name I'm trying to every day saying that are relieved belong unto you that's great to watch reveals allow for you and I thought their secret name that we made known down to Eternity question about it a relation of what foreign foreign foreign
