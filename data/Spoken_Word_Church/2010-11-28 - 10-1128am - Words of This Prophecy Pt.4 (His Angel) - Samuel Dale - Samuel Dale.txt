dick he would to bring us out a little bit earlier the Sunday school class will be coming on up they can catch up we'll take care of all the announcements and get everything out of the way cuz we've got to be through somewhere a little after 11:30 cuz they're going to be here with the food about that time and we want everybody to stay and eat now we're not we you know uh some of you didn't know this was going to be a time but we're going to have a Thanksgiving dinner together and then there won't be any afternoon service so we're just going to have Fellowship ship together and you know and sit around and talk about the Lord and just do that but we're the church is doing that for you in Thanksgiving for the fact that you have spent a year you know with us and all and we're very thankful for the word of God that he has revealed unto us and we're thankful for all things and we want you to to uh stay and eat with us and things you know and fellowship together now by way of announcements uh brother Bill there gave me a thing that said that brother Luke Gibson uh was in the hospital with chest pains and he's having shortness of breath so most of us know brother Luke over in South Carolina so just remember to pray for him that will be all right and brother got the word this morning brother Calvin Ward that goes brother Donnie's uh Reagan's Church brother Calvin Ward's daughter has passed away so remember that you know she's been sick for many many many years so just remember you know so keep that in your mind and uh sister Rachel's sick this morning brother Joe called last night and they they were all sick and we prayed and and but everybody's here but sister Rachel and she had a high temperature so she chose not to come this morning so remember that remember my wife too she's been having trouble with her back and I don't know whether it's because of her one leg being that they operated on it made her throw her back out or whatever it's been it doesn't matter it's the devil anyway but just keep her in your prayers that you know that she's having a lot of trouble now with her back and her knees so you know pray that the Lord would bless her now remember the Lord willing this coming Saturday will be the Bible study here at the church our topic has been justification then we went to sanctification so we have a Bible study every first Saturday of the month starting at 6:00 in the afternoon till about 8:00 at night so remember that and be with us that this topic this uh time will be the baptism of the Holy Ghost so just you know come and be with us and fellowship together and bring your your uh thoughts and ideas along uh the Lord willing brother Collins will be here preaching for us on Wednesday December the 8th all right and then brother ju forny will be here preaching on uh December the 12th so remember those uh way brother Donnie and myself will be going hunting that week and we are going to try our best to be back here on Sunday for the services right if we have to make another one of those like Richard and I did last weekend and drove over 900 miles to get here to be in the service cuz I surely don't want to miss a service you know I I I want to be here okay so just remember that the announcements is there we've made them you know and everything so uh keep these in mind we're glad to see some back that had been with us but we say they're not visitors cuz they've been here before but we appreciate them all right if you like turning your scriptures turn to Revelations 1 I haven't preached too awfully much in the past month and going into part of the next month not because we were gone but you know some of it was one weekend we was way but we wouldn't away just fooling around we were not hunting and all like that we were having a good time uh we were in the services there with brother Claude and brother Pinkston and Wade preached one Sunday at one and I preached the Sunday at the other one and then I was back preaching for brother Claude on Wednesday and Wade had the Sunday following Brother Pinkston so we had a good time just you know preaching and and they seem to enjoy the the fellowship and and all and had a good time with brother Jim and his his wife there hunting they just make us part of the family and everything but you know just pray that the Lord would help us okay Revelations 1 as I said to you in the Sunday school class I asked brother dick to get us up just a little bit early so you know you're you're still up and that's fine okay Revelations 1 father we thank you we love you and we ask you Lord to just come on the scene now into our hearts and our lives that Lord we'd be able to to get ourselves out of the way this morning and be able to speak what you have given unto us amen and Lord you just come and then make it manifest cuz no matter what we could do no matter what we could say it wouldn't be worth anything unless you come and honor it and Lord just help us there's many uh sicknesses Among Us many things that Satan has tried to bring upon the people but yet Lord you are the one that will take care of all things and we believe you we thank you and we know that all things work together for good but sometimes we don't understand that Lord while we're going through it we we uh you know we kind of uh are human and we don't understand all the time but yet you help us and Lord just come now and speak to each one of our hearts and our lives that we may Lord speak what you'd have to be said and then Lord you reveal it because I can't we ask you to have the your way with each one now bless brother Luke there brother Luke Gibson Lord as he's had the chest pains and the things we pray that you'd take a bit of it away from him and let everything be all right and bless the family that lost the loved one and we just thank you for all things we know that in a time of trouble we can depend upon you guide each one of us now in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 now we've been reading this for a while and uh you know so we want to get into the message and try to uh uh you know understand a little okay Revelations 1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who bear record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he sought blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now we have a lot of quotes to be given out to you uh but we'll uh we will try not to uh burden you cuz we're going to shorten the service a little bit today and go ahead ahead and have her eats together because you know but what I'm going to do is probably this morning a lot of background and then just come up a little bit in the message to be able to understand now uh The Book of Revelation to to some of the new ones you know the church taught us I come up through the Baptist you know and was a deacon and all in the Baptist Church so I was there for quite a while and uh but you know we were told to stay away from The Book of Revelations cuz we couldn't understand it you know and told to stay out of Genesis because we couldn't follow what was going on because we didn't know but you know that was the devil with his scarecrow to try to scare us away from it you know to keep us from being able to uh you know to see and understand good see Dr Sher back there with us and uh you know to be able to uh follow the word of God right I believe all the word of God is inspired amen and then the reason Satan don't want you to read the book of Revelations is because it's a book written to you and it's about you right all right right because as I've often told you to do and I wish you would read it you know you read the book of Revelations and and you won't find Jesus Christ by himself you'll find him in different forms different ways different things but you won't find him just being byself you say well there was a lamb we haven't got there yet that's way over but what about the Lamb of God that took the book you know well you better read your Bible that Lamb of God had seven horns and seven eyes all right and that came from the bride of Christ down through the church ages so keep that in your mind as we try to to speak about it and then think about the Book of Revelations is being a book written personally to you that's right and it's written about you because see you've got a vast gap between uh say the book of Acts and the uh happening of the church in the book of Acts you know and then you've got the church ages but you've got about 2,000 years almost in transpiring some 1900 and something that maybe not a lot is said but then you get to the Book of Revelations and that's your book right amen now thank God for God sending us a prophet right because without a prophet we wouldn't have understood the symbolics that's right all right now a lot of it is plain language right you know I mean it's plain language it's written there in the Book of Revelations you know that doesn't even need to be interpreted because like the uh the uh where we'll get to it later you know where it talks about the seven golden candles he tells you that that's the messengers to the age and the church I mean there's a lot of it this this di but see we were scared to approach those things by the religious people who maybe ins sincerity but honesty you know uh they had those ideas but uh why do we worry about it now when God has revealed himself to us right and we follow a message that we don't have to worry about am but that's one thing that I'm wanting you to get is uh you know there's two factions that I see in the message or the hour people one group goes this way and one group goes this way all right one group group going one way they they throwed away their Bibles they they just took when they heard the prophet they they throw their Bibles basically away they they're laying there but they don't use them they just it's all what brother Bram said right without being able to say anything about the Bible that group going that way the other group goes this way that they wind up with well brother random come to turn us back to the word so now don't matter what he says it's what we say about the Bible all right now that's two two groups everything you always watching is always pulling this away pulling that way but I believe in going right down the middle of the road you know I I my wife gets on to me all the time because and when I'm driving down the road I'm running closer to the to the center line yes sir yes sir and and now I always get over when the car comes but I see somebody saying yeah they probably do it now Anna Anna drives over to the white line on the side she puts a vast Gap well others are saying that see because that's just the way you do it but I just you know the the the center of the road 99% of the people don't run close to the center so you know what you got a track on the highway that you run on right and basically everybody runs right you get in that track right why because it's wore out everybody's driving on it if you move over about 2 feet it's just as smooth right see because the center of the highway is made where all of the tries floats away from the center it's made up a little higher and if you lay your left hand up on the steering wheel and just keep a little tension on it it'll just follow that line cuz if you don't it's going to float over to the right cuz everybody's got it that way further north you go the more you know about it right but now my point is one thing I want to stay in the middle of the road and in the middle of the road then uh I don't have to worry about it and the mistakes I make God will cover for me when I don't understand and after 40 Years of studying the message you know or more than that then uh you know I I don't have much worry about uh some of the things I say because after being around that long right you know you already to be able to have something settled that's what a lot of people says beware of that person got all the answers well I don't clim to have all of them I told you what I've got right I've told you before what it is a man that's got all the answers his head is so full of knowledge that he don't have no sense right like brother dick says you go into a place you know and you look around and our sets all of the bosses you know and they're doing the jacket would you look over in the corner and there that's an old guy with his Fe propped up probably don't even have a Time yes sir but you know who I want to talk to about the business that guy cuz them other guys don't know anything about it so you get a head full of knowledge you don't know how to do it then you know what my interpretation or thoughts is as long as I got contact with the one that's got the knowledge I don't have to have my brain to full sir cuz I don't have a lot of it so I depend upon the one that's got the answers then I just ask him amen and he tells me okay amen now you know who I'm talking about the prophet's message is the ones got the answers to it and he he didn't have the answers so God give him cuz I don't believe he's God now that's one thing I don't believe and you know and I said this group puts too much emphasis and this group don't put enough emphasis but let's follow the middle of the road to get down to to be able to see where we're at amen and what's going on but now remember this is a series I've been on this is message number four of words of this prophecy here all somebody got in in the back there we too have had some times now I'm glad that was brought that um we were listening to the services that while we were gone the other night my wife and I were and there was a tiny bit of Buzz so make sure that you musicians turn off all your instruments because some way is coming through and getting on the internet to where that you can hear a little in the background so maybe that's what that needs to be to where I remember to say it you know cuz my head's not full of knowledge I have to write myself notes okay bring all things your right but see what does it mean the the words of this prophecy now prophecy is foretelling future events all right now as I said the church ages the time and all like that John goes to patmas about ad 95 somewhere right in there and he's writing and he's about uh at least two years into the writing of that they argue over the 9395 and all like that that's no problem but I know he was there quite a while right and uh he was writing the Book of Revelations they put him out there because of the fact that he was trying to put the Bible down into terms that we could you know we can understand so when he got out there you know God comes to him and and he begins to reveal to him and he's revealing to him what has taken place that's the Book of Revelation and what has been SE and then he reveals what is and then he reveals the future okay that's the way John was there far he reveals all the way to the Future home you know it's brought to John oh on patas all right now in in doing that then see we can go back and read and we can understand what has been what is and what's going to be because of of of the fact of it being a prophecy y see which is a foretelling of future events now remember how we covered that you know I know we talk strange and and odd and a lot of people say need to understand this well um I do believe we need to understand you know and when we come to the Book of Revelations notice what it says the revelation of Jesus Christ now listen which God gave unto him Jesus to show unto his servants the things which shortly must come and he said and signified which signified means to make known you know or to to give a sign or an indication right but to make known and he said and signified by his Angel unto his servant John now John is the one to record right right right he's here only to record right okay now he's to record what he sees right he does the best he can and to write down what he sees all right so you're dealing with an angel coming to John but a revelation coming from God given to Jesus to give to the angel to give to John you say well boy that's trinitarianism no it's the correct order of the Bible it's exactly the way that uh it has to be cuz what's not Services now I'm asking you to do this write down your thoughts on the godhead write down your thoughts on uh you know and questions or ideas about the godhead because I intend to preach for the first time in uh 35 years I intend to preach a watch not service this time and what I intend to do is take about 4 hours that's 8 to 12 right we're going to be here for something you know so we start off and have a little song service and then we we do don't you worry about it I won't be that long but uh then we'll get into the service and then we're going to have questions and answers am all right so you write down your questions about the godhead and we'll try our best to speak about it as I said if we if I don't have any problems you ask me brother Dale how does an automobile engine work I don't have a bit of problem telling you I don't know right right I got a lot of confidence in them that do know Richard took one apart up at the building one time and he was just throwing Parts over what you you never get this thing back together well you know what he got it back together it run right but I wouldn't dare do it cuz I'd have had to wrot down boat one goes in boat hole two goes and that's the only way I could ever got it done okay but see I want to speak about the godhead so write down your questions and answers and and like I'm saying I don't have all the answers and I have no problem saying right are there Aon back there he called me up years ago and he asked me a question and he was shocked because he was thought that he had been told that this great intellectual giant I reckon he thought was down in Georgia that knew everything and he asked me a question and I said I don't know and that was a shock to him well you know what I didn't know I could have spent hours trying to convinc him I thought I knew it right an intellectual speech but I didn't know what he asked me so I no problem I said don't know well see I don't have any problem saying I don't know so you ask me a question I don't have any problem saying all right we'll listen to what you got to say about it okay so we're going to do that on the watch not service but now listen when Jesus came here he didn't come as a flesh man is not necessarily him standing there in totally bodily form that's what we want to think about you know Jesus and brother brandom said on page 13 Church AG book that the Book of Revelation is the only book in the Bible where as Jesus personally appearing to ascribe to write it's not necessarily there that he's coming in a body you know can be I'm not no problem if that's what you believe I don't have no problem I just tell you what I think but he's coming there to reveal to that angel that was to deliver the message to John about himself you say well I thought y'all believe that Jesus was God I do amen see God I preached this message back there a few weeks ago whenever I preached back under October uh I preached the message about God limiting himself you remember that now how is it that God can't see our sins right why did he not annihilate us right now because he doesn't see our sins why because there was a bumper blood even in the Old Testament of the blood of bulls and goats made a bumper blood you've heard it right and it covered mankind to keep us from being destroyed because the best we can do we've got problems right see so the bumper blood covered mankind until Jesus Christ came and then when he came it changed from a bumper blood of an animal that could only cover sin and not eradicated it changed to the blood of Jesus Christ all right which died the Bible says once for all all right and see then by him doing that see he paid the price and the bumper is covering us right see because if not why he would just annihilate us that's right so then he limited himself but he done it by what he said right he said I put the blood it wasn't what we done it wasn't what we thought up ourselves it's what he said he'd do now God is HonorBound to his word amen I like the way brother Brown said it one day and really when I first heard him I thought a lot about it but he said if you can find in the Bible a promise of God he said and you can call God on the scene and said if he don't do it amen he said you can call him a liar right right you see a man make that statement that's how much confidence he had in what God said that's right right right cuz if this is if this is not the word of God I know the story behind all of it don't worry about it I know who they say wrote a lot of this in here but I've seen it Vindicated myself and don't worry about it amen I know what they say that the writers of this and the writers of that and who you knew was that well you know you like they say about Moses how could Moses write of his own death before he died in Deuteronomy well if you'll explain how he wrote in Genesis 1 what happened to Genesis I don't think you got any problem about him writing about his own death cuz see that's what we get tied up with we we try to make you know great contradictions but they're not there amen he said well this is this that but it's it's simple terminologies you just sit down and reason it out a little bit you'll find out that it's not I believe it's the word of God delivered unto you and I that's right it was delivered by mankind that's what we're going to get into see if you believe the Bible is just what man said yes sir that's right you got a problem I don't believe it that way I believe it's what God delivered unto us that way then I can depend upon amen but see you don't realize what people do and and the depend dependence I said now I'm in the middle of the road see all right the dependence people has upon believing the Bible is that we must believe because God said that's what he would do Malachi 4 he said he would send us Elijah the prophet right to turn the hearts of the children back he said he'd do it right now if we don't believe brother of ram was that one that he said would come we better find somebody that's sensible that's not a don't you don't need to me bang your the head you see that that's sensible amen but if we believe that that was the one God used then he can't be contrary to anything else is in here that's sensible he wouldn't be a prophet if he's coner to anything else now a lot of things that I used to read I thought he was contrary to it when I first heard him right how about you amen but after beginning to read it a little while I found out as only way it could be said see God sent his word now he used the writers I know I ain't going to get nowhere so keep these papers till Wednesday all right okay I ain't going to get for just a little bit but see God used the apostles to write right right Matthew Mark Luke and John right seeing Luke and who Luke and Mark were not even original all right but they were the ones chosen Amen to write the word of God right okay now then he used Paul Peter James John Jude Titus right if I miss any of them in the writings of the New Testament Parts you put them in he used them to bring to us the understanding of almighty God amen amen and they wrote as that was revealed unto them right see as I said Luke and Mark were not original disciples they were not there with the Lord Jesus but I love to read the book of Luke you know because Luke says the only one that's got it Luke says right in the beginning he says having perfect understanding now you just think about he wouldn't D to see all the Lord Jesus done but he sat down and he listened to the John and them tell about it he listened to the others tell about it and the Holy Spirit says right that down when he finishes up you take the Book of Luke it's wonderful writings of a man amen sir but now listen if that's all you have is the writings of what you think is a man come on they were just like any other cult right that's right right we're just like any other cult any other group of people uh you know we're like any uh Buddha Hindu whatever right we're no different if that's all we believe right because even they believe that their books are inspired yes right the Islamic the the different ones you believe the books are inspired your Quran your they believe their books are inspired and handed down of God see if you don't believe that I wouldn't even be one of them that's right that's right that's just the way I am I'm just honest right see but see I believe the Bible is the word of God Amen now I say it this way for your benefit not mine if there is a God whatever you want to call him yeh U whatever you want to make it if that God cannot keep his word straight right come on then I don't want to serve him because I'm smarter than he is if I can prove that he's wrong that's right that's as tough as I make it right I mean that's just what that's just the way I believe it good see then I make the statement if God can't keep his word straight who do we serve amen are we a glorified monkey that fell off of an evolution tree sir you know well I just soon believe that is to to believe that God can't keep his word straight now that's my emphasis that's my statement that's where I depend upon the word of God Amen all right but see what I've tried to get you to see is it said the Revelation that God give to Jesus mhm now you'll be surprised when we get on to the watch notot service because basically what your thoughts are right there that and that's the reason I said it was not necessarily a flesh man that come to John right it was not necessarily a 16 element man that walked up to John that's right amen it was Jesus Christ amen so you when I say Jesus most everybody thinks of the flesh that's right right that's why I asked the question one time when when I say son of God what do you think of and everybody here said 2,000 years ago I said my Lord even the theologians knew that the Son of God was the Loos that went out of God in the beginning the Creator amen but see that's where we get tied up into flesh and we say say that Jesus didn't understand his part in the Kingdom until he comes to John on patment cuz we say the flesh couldn't understand right well I didn't know the flesh understood anything I thought the flesh could only work by the spirit and the soul I thought the flesh was useless if not come up here I'll tap you in the head knock out all your brain operations and we'll see what you see see the body the the the flesh is dead amen right without something to motivate it right doctor sitting back here he's he's in the other reals of it but he studied enough of that to know you that body is usess without something to make it motivated you don't lust with your body right you portray lust with your body you have to lust with your spiritual realm all right so don't just say that when Jesus was here well it's just CA he's in flesh it wasn't there the bumper blood of G of God was put here and there was nobody in flesh right right come on you understand what I mean by that you say it was just the flesh that kept him from understanding well what about the bumper blood who put it there that would cover us and are the people of the Old Testament see we get our our minds locked on to things and not realizing we turn out to be a Oneness more than we are the true understanding of God amen amen that's right you can never get away away from the fact of Father Son and Holy Ghost and be able to believe one true and living God right amen cuz if you narrow it down do you just got Jesus your Oneness and the Oneness is the just as far off the scale as the Trinity is on the other end of the scale amen see it has to be a revelation amen and to see this is the way God done it now that's my point the way God done it and what he said limited him to where that he you know I don't have no education forgive me go ahead you say limit God oh boy you're something no you tell me what it is I'm up for opinions and ideas of expression that's the best I can do but when God said he said his word was using Wy he said Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated before nether one of them was born now that's Bible right y well now that made him this now that's your idea right now you're trying to figure out how he done it don't worry about it just believe it I don't know how he saved any of you and I am is anybody in here that was good enough to be saved oh boy no that's right it doesn't work that way amen he saved us because we accepted it we believed it amen but get my point the Revelation that God give to Jesus to give to John now when Jesus was here on Earth see you go right back well it's a flesh now when Jesus was here on Earth they ask him when he's coming he said I don't know right well that just CA the flesh I mean is that all you got that's that's an answer to hold you for a while right right that's something to hold you for a while but can you see that because he condescended to earth oh my I'm on watch that service I got to get off that but get the point I get on because he condescended down he he put these limits and he told people what to do you offer that blood I'll take care of the rest of it well you know what they done in the Old Testament they took a lamb up and offered him for their sins and went right back and done the same thing again amen right amen we better not do it in Jesus Christ amen but get the point God had something that he didn't make known to mankind and Jesus said I don't know when I'm coming said only the Father Knows well I boy you're a trinitarian then we try to conceive the idea that God was inside of that flesh and that made him to word that he wouldn't know all things not only made him to where he couldn't display all things cuz it only made him like I said in the other day to the basis that he couldn't be all over the world how come at times he knew everything and other times he didn't know everything right because God limited himself amen I've often him said I was going to preach on the god with amnesia you know what amnesia is you forget things right you know God has to forget our sins amen you tell me how he does it come on explain how God forgets our sins that's right when he's omnicient omnip omnipresent and he knows everything right how does he not know what we do that's right cuz he done it himself that way amen that's right even you totem pole would know what you done cuz the totem pole be looking at you amen how much greater Is God but you see there was something that was not made known while he was here right amen now I asked you a simple question not to trap you or be smart a simple question how many of you have the new birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen you don't have to raise your hand I'm just asking you well do you know everything time then you'll say no it's because of this flesh I wouldn't use that too much that's right you cuz if you ain't careful you'll blame God for what you do in the flesh you know my brother subed this preacher 12 years in college he said God made me this way he made me a sinner he can't judge me for being a sinner oh my I said brother you didn't God didn't make you a sinner you made yourself right you volunteered it wouldn't what he done right every baby's born into the world perfect you make your own self a sinner right amen but it's the Revelation that God give to Jesus okay I gave you the ones there that you can look at on page one of your notes and then we'll just go a while and we'll quit cuz this I've done give it to you but it's 12 13 and 14 of the church age book where the prophet of God and I wish you would read the church ages either from the church age book or the church Age series and if you don't have the books of the series you can go on the internet and pull them up and read them but listen listen what the prophet of God had to say I know I've read these before but I've got to put these in here because people out there don't know what we've already heard so you know they have to be you know I'm talking about the internet system all right brother Brown starts off and he said the Scribe not author of this book is St John the Divine historians agree that he lived the last part of his life in Ephesus though at the time of the writing of this book he was on the aisle of Patman he was put there as I said while too because he was trying to put the get the the the writings you know to where people could read them they outlawed him they boiled him in oil for 24 hours and couldn't get the Holy Ghost out of him so they decided we'll send him to alcatra now see we would understand alcatra better than we'd understand patmas but that's what it was it wasn't nothing but a Rock Island that was filled with snakes and and garbage and things and you know and they throw their bad prisoners out there and that's where John was sent because they couldn't do nothing with him what are you going to do with a man you can't boil it out of him but watch no at the time of the writing of this book he was on the aisle of patas it is not the life story of John but is a revelation of Jesus Christ in the future Church ages in verse three it is called a prophecy and that is actually what it is so we're going on reading now this book is usually termed the revelation of St John but that is not correct it is the revelation of Jesus Christ given to John for Christians of all ages it is the only book in the entire Bible that is written by Jesus himself through personally appearing to a scribe amen now so it's the Revelation that God give to Jesus but how did he do it he gave it to an angel to give to John we went over that the other night you read Revelation one I mean Revelation 1 verse 1 23 and you're dealing with what the angel says you read uh a little I'll hold that we'll get further but look now the Greek word for Revelation I'm going over page 13 number two not number two in your notes number one with the line all the way down means this is a continual reading okay that just that's reason I put that line down with the one or whatever the number it means this is continual reading it's not a gaping the Greek word for Revelation is apocalypse which means unveiling this unveiling is perfectly described in the example of a sculpture unveiling his work of Statuary exposing to the own looker it is uncovering revealing what was previously hidden now the uncovering is not only the revelation listen to this one the uncovering is not only the revelation of the person of Christ but it is the revelation of his future work in the oncoming seven Church ages now that bears in mind to we hold that all right contined reading and I said that this book of Revelation is a revelation of Jesus and what he is doing in the church ages for those Seven Ages it is a revelation because the disciples themselves didn't know these previously recorded truths you know about the revelations or anything it had not been previously revealed to them you remember that they came to Jesus in the book of Acts and asked him are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel and he said it is not for you to know the times or the seasons these men were still thinking of Jesus having an Earthly Kingdom but it was a spiritual Kingdom that he was going to build even he could not tell them about his place in it listen for the father had not revealed it unto him but now after his death and resurrection and at this particular time in his mediatorial ministry he's able to set forth here in this revelation of himself to John what his glory and presence in the church would mean and do right all right now Jesus didn't understand because I said he said I don't know when I'm com you know why he didn't understand it because he didn't live it right now I preached to you a few weeks ago and showed you where brother Bram said and gave you the quotes that we do what Jesus couldn't do wait minut he was God he do we do what Jesus couldn't do Jesus couldn't preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost because he' not been crucified that's what the scripture said what the prophet said that's right so we preach on the day of Pentecost Peter preached the baptism of the Holy Ghost and people received it right now while Jesus was here no one was given eternal life right come on come on show me in the Bible amen that's right amen nobody got eternal life the closest man that was to it was John on one end of it but remember John was not in the Kingdom cuz the Bible say John receiv received the Holy Ghost in his mother's womb but the Bible said the least in the kingdom is greater than John but John wasn't in the Kingdom right the new birth never come until the day of Pentecost right that's right I know what we bapti just believe so I talk with a brother about that oh we believed all them deciples that dud believe they born again no they wasn't you couldn't be born again without the death of the testator what Paul says in Romans right Jesus Christ had not died the scripture said the Holy Ghost had not been given right right all right you go on the other end of the scale and say what about the thief on the cross remember he never got a year he had to go with Jesus that's right right right that's right cuz he said this day you'll be with me in Paradise he never gave him eternal life he said well see that's why people don't understand they as I said they go this Rod or this or this way see a big portion of people of this message don't even believe that come on that's right they think that that you had eternal life in the Old Testament and they had eternal life in the stop where'd they get it from right why did Jesus have to die to had eternal life come on he had to die to release that life amen amen it was vital up in him right because his word said it was well all he had to do just go out and give it see that's what you think cuz you're a Catholic you think you can give it because it belong to your church oh my brown much you think you give eternal life because they said believe what you say oh no I don't depend upon what you say or I say I depend upon what the word of God says right amen that's why I stay with that prophet's message that's right but now listen you said but God you mean you believe he's God and he didn't know all things you believe you're born again do you know all things I'm sorry I'm I know I become your enemy because I told you the truth that's what Paul said didn't he brother Dale brother Sho said this I don't care what brother sh so says I'm not going to argue with nobody about it I'm just going to tell you what I believe right but then you better not ask me about so and so what he believes I might tell you why he believes that amen cuz I ain't played around all these years see God came down in human flesh amen you agree sir even your River Jordan people would have to agree those that believe that Jesus wouldn't go out to the River Jordan those that teach that they would have to agree to these next statements Jesus as a baby couldn't die with your sins Jesus at 12 years old even though he could stand there and confound the scholars he couldn't die for your sins he couldn't die for your sins until he become of age cu the Bible said it the high priest had to be becoming 30 before he could enter the ministry amen right like I said you take Jesus we can prove he's born in ail you can prove it born in April he would proven he was crucified in April now have him preaching 3 and 1/2 years and get it in there you done goofed up but if you let Jesus in the ministry at 29 and a half that's why that high priest had to be becoming 30 you're 29 and a half he can enter the ministry and go on Jesus couldn't do it until he entered the ministry that's right he entered the ministry on the River Jordan right not that he wasn't God all the time no he was amen but it's because what he said he's going to do amen what about God could walk among man and not destroy man yes you explain that you explain how that Jesus could be God even if you believe he's the second person of the Trinity come on how could he be here and not destroy us come on CU he kept his word they brought a little woman to him right one day that's right and said your word says kill her right now what was he going to do like I heard somebody the other day said was a good point was it you or somebody said you know that they bring the man that's now that's against the law that's right that was against the law the Pharisees broke the law they're supposed to bring the man and the woman and throw them down then he going to kill both of them that was against the law they broke their own law by not doing it right and what Jesus do he couldn't turn around I don't believe I've seen you do nothing like that no he know that's telling the truth about her yes sir but you know what he done he got got rid of their Witnesses right right he got rid of the witnesses without a witness the Bible said in the mouth of two or three Witnesses if there have been two or three line that have said she done it he' said killer course my word says it that's right he didn't break his word he just got rid of the witnesses amen thank you Lord right he turned around finally to said where's your Witnesses I don't have any he said neither do I condemn thee cuz he was still under the bumper blood of the Old Testament itself see I tell people you know even and my nephew is a Baptist preacher he knows that you tell most people say turn to the first book of the New Testament turn to Matthew automatically that's not the first book of the New Testament the first book of the New Testament is the book of Acts CU in Matthew Mark and Luke and John Jesus was still under the law him self he come under the law to redeem them when it went under the law that's why he tell him when he healed one now you go offer that's right the offering of Moses exactly cuz he was still under the law itself yes sir he was the end of the law Calvary right amen amen yes sir did you say well brother you mean God limits himself by his word by his word word amen if he tells you something in the word don't you worry about it amen he'll keep his word just make sure you know what he's saiding in his word that's right but you see Jesus didn't know his part because that had not been made known to him see that's where it goes in know here's where we go I keep coming around and around all but how could he be God not know because he said he would do it that way thank God that he said he would do it your sins and your iniquities will I remember no more that what he said did he even speak to David and David in the psalm in the spirit the scripture said stand up and say blessed is a man to whom God will not impute sin amen amen amen are we still in the Bible yes amen see God limited himself then not just because he stepped in flesh but because his word you explain one thing to me and I don't have to explain everything else you explain to me how that God killed those animals in Genesis one or two amen Genesis 2 right God killed those animals right when you tell me your God is just a spirit he's just floating around he's just a spirit bless well who killed them animals that's right who made the first sacrifice come on almighty God killed them animals and took the skins and put them on out of KN now you tell me anything else well how you done he used an angel to do that brother Dale he just well I didn't know Angels could do them things either come on Amen right come on come on cuz you see that's what we're going to get into right right now some of you sisters it's almost 11:30 if you want to run down to try to get everything ready we'll cut the service off and then we'll just singing go on till you get ready for us to come down there supposed to be like 11:30 we're not trying to cut off work God's work which're is trying to be of and do what's right and while you're doing it then we'll just cover another point or two and go on it will help later on to understand I got this written down it'll help on wed on the watch Night Service it will help you better to understand how that God done things and how that that limits himself to what he he doneen but now I I'm listen folks now if You' ever believed brother Dale would you please listen all right now see they make a lot about brother Brandon and there's nobody here that honors him no more than I do but I don't believe he was God that's right that's right A lot of people the Mage believe he was you'd be surprised about the doctrine that go around the message and they don't realize the end of that Doctrine and what it means and you may believe it that's up to you I'm I'm just me but you see the doctrine of the uh the old Doctrine it was called tent Visions our return Ministries that brother brandham has got to come back and do this that and the other if you'll finally run those things out you'll find out that they actually teach that uh brother random will be our God in the Millennium yes sir see it's exactly what Satan wants you to believe that's right amen Satan wants you to believe that he's God now there's a lot of people that believe that brother randam was the one that come to John on patas we'll get back to that Wednesday and they believe it because they use the scripture that he'll do nothing except reveal itself to the prophets and I'm not I'm not picking on nobody this message was in planning many many months ago okay so then you won't think that I was just saying something because what the brother preached the other weekend right what that man preach is his business what he believes is his business I don't have anything to do with it I just don't believe that brother brandham was the one that come to John on P I believe you're putting too much emphasis amen upon things others believe that John was translated over to see our day where brother brand was here preaching the word that sounds a little better but I still don't clear it up to me I just don't see it so I intend to bring a a complete series on this and to show you what I believe and why I believe it but what what others believe is their business I'm not against anybody I love everybody I'm not I'm not against anybody no no problems but if you believe that brother brandom come to John on patmas what are you making the emphasis and I thoroughly listen I thoroughly enjoy what the brother had to say about we don't worship brother brandom we don't do those things I'm I'm right in there 100% I listen Okay but I just don't believe that brother brandham come to John on Patman right now I believe the emphasis should be placed upon not who come to John on patmas right but who come to brother brandom here in this life that's right now that's my emphasis that's right we better put the emphasis now go ahead and make these statements brother brandom in many many many emphasis before and after the seal would talk about a great one to come right and that's made a lot of doctrines around the message that brother so and so is a great one Lowry this one that the other there's a lot of people run forth with doctrines that you know that claim that they are the one that brother Bram spoke of I sat on the porch with a man and I've told you many times about it and he believed that he was the one to come the great one and I just looked him in the face and told him I said he weighed 475 lb but I couldn't back off the word because how big he was but I just looked at him I said listen brother the great one to come is the Lord Jesus Christ right amen and you're not that one that was to come if you believe you are I'm going just tell you to your face you him because it's the Lord Jesus Christ amen it's not who come to John on patmas it's who come to brother Brown come on Amen that we better be concerned about that's right because you can't take the great one on over there as being a human flesh no that's right and see one thing that people needs to do and in case a brother hears this if I ever talk with him I'll tell him you need to get the right scripture if you're going to talk about anything because Revelations 19 is not the scripture brother Ram 's talking about the angel coming to John that's revelation 22 CU Revelation 19 is the spirit of Prophecy it tells you exactly who it is right but see I'm not against those people Heaven Help right I've had this discussion with a brother one time before about it and I said listen what would it help us if we knew brother randam was the one that come to John what would that help you would it change you yes sir would it change you if brother R was going to come back in a tent and put it up and preach across the country I've never told people what anything contrary to that I believe brother random can come back in the resurrection exactly and he breached for 30 40 days exactly but not looking for him not sit down waiting on him to raise and then and in life about Muhammad come on oh and the horse that they keep over there at least they changed the horse every 4 hours yes sir at least they believe it enough to keep the horse ready that's right the people that claim brother Brown to coming back with the airplane said it' take 2 years and he said it himself two years to make the airplane flyable so he said brother can't come back for two years you see we life at other people that's but I'm just telling you there was an angel that come to Joy right we'll get to that cuz there was an angel that come to John to give him the Revelation in Revelations one we better find out who that angel is y right and get him in the right way amen now I want to ask you one question because this a border on it you believe that brother random had an angel with him sure amen he said he was with him from birth you believe it right amen now that angel told him about serpent seed and things right that angel told him about the godhead y yes you agree amen how come that angel couldn't tell him what the seal work you better he didn't throw that angel away and get him another one that's right but how come that that angel couldn't tell blood around about seals that's right you better think that's right not just well I got boy I tell you what I just a brother preaching I just feel so good amen I do too right but what are you saying right amen that's right my Bible says you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free see you think brother Dale is just a arrogant hateful old guy listen you may not like what I've just said about what that brother said but just remember your soul is in my hands as long as you're here that's right right your soul I'm responsible for it as long as you're here that's right so I must protect your soul am that's right amen thank you but you see we don't believe that God is on the scene we just think it's an argumentative I have no argument with nobody that's right I love all these brothers I've had them to preach right here that believe things that I didn't believe amen but I love the Brothers right and they done good but open your ears to hear to see what he said right that's right cuz you might find out even Brother D says something sometimes ain't right yes sir BL you said you do Brother D no I don't do it intentionally that's right I don't do that intentionally but I am 7 years old like my wife say says you can't remember nothing else but you can remember the message well okay thank God for that because that's what I let's stand together let's gool down and get ready they haven't let us know yet but let's sing a little bit brother dick uh tell them to Richard tell him to let us know when he's ready we'll sing a little bit until that time okay I hope you understand I believe in one true and living God Amen I believe Jes Jesus was that God Amen but our problem is is we we've come down and we tried to down him into that body without leaving God in the place that he was why would okay ain't not even here yet okay we could have preached another hour but we'll sing another hour but you see God is revealing himself to you amen just because you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't mean you know everything right that's right that's true but yet you're born again right amen but there's one thing for sure Jesus couldn't deny anything the father said and be God that's right you and I can't deny anything God says and believe that that's God in us amen that don't need interpreting that's why I just like when I was in the Baptist brother mod ask me because Baptist Doctrine is one God that's the Baptist Doctrine one God but it's what God in threee person Blessed Trinity see it's just as much Trinity as anything else well when brother Mo asked me he said the brother had introduced me to the message he said what do you believe about God I said he knew Baptist he's smart and you he said what do you believe I said one true and living God my brother was a strict trinitarian and even before I heard brother brand I'd argue with him all night long in funerals we'd set up with people you know we used to do that in the old days we set up all night with the bodies you know and I set up all night and argued with him over one God you see when brother Mo asked me that question he said what do you believe I said I believe in one true and living God he said explain it I said it's God and true person Blessed Trinity cuz that's the only way I could explain he said you're Trinity just like everybody else called a person is a personality personality is an individual individual to person he said you're a smart human being what do you believe I said I don't believe that anymore it didn't take no two weeks or two years for me to understand it I realized I had my hi nailed to the wall by the word of God Amen and I simply looked at him and said I don't believe that no more I don't believe in God in three persons no more but I believe in God in many many manifestations many forms that he's in and I believe right now he's in the form of the Bride of Jesus Christ upon this Earth living in you and me that's where a Wess can't do that cuz a Wess see the life's manifestation of God was Jesus that's why it's Oneness right they don't believe in one in in another form right see we go out of here God goes to the Jews that's another form we get it to why Throne judgment he sitting there and gives eternal life to foolish virgin that's another form of God Amen we get into the future home it's another form don't ever do away with anything amen don't do away with any of the attributes of God all the attributes he had he had before the world begun he just couldn't display them don't never do away with those attributes just bring them together amen and you don't do away with this form then we'll get to it Wednesday cuz that's what everybody goes on they say all God was he poured into Christ well you just done away with God no P him over to Christ well what about the message of Che down to the endless ages that your Prophet said we' receive after we leave this world you mean we're going out of this world we're having a wonderful time on the word of God and understanding and we're going up to heaven we're going to sit down and pray hard it's going to be an endless eternity of An Almighty God revealing himself into you and I he has attributes I said it last night I woke back up he has attributes he have never displayed you want to think about that n you about that okay if he's got a message to cheer that's an attribute he's got attributes he ain't never displayed we're just here getting enough to be able to go there and know what he's doing amen think on these things go ahead 129 anybody has a need the AL open we're s a little while waiting on them to get everything ready anybody have and let be in the the and the sister asking for brother Jonathan remember he's over in in began to S now but let's just believe that God will take care of you let's believe that father you laid on our sister's heart this one that's there and having to be there Lord that we can be here

that's what I I'm a new creation I'm a brand new man who are we we are father we are going we are people King we are we are am then they're still not here so if you want to be seated and we won't change things around much but if you want to be seated just remember the things and just pray that the Lord would bless you and give you understanding I know that the way that I speak requires for God to reveal it I know that but I I can't help it I was made that way and you know I I I do the best I can to try to put it into simple language to try to to uh help people right but I realize too that uh it takes God to reveal yes it's not me and you that can reveal or whatever we can do it's not that way it takes God to reveal but see then when I say things take it and and go home and consider it and then ask God to speak to you yes and hey I realize that sometimes that I preached things for 10 15 years before it's really is is really made known a lot of times and you know it it takes a lot of background to understand sometimes when someone is trying to bring something that you're not used to hearing you know because it come out with a new thing and that's what they think it is but uh I'm not talking about something new I'm talking about the oldest thing that has ever been talking about God revealing himself to mankind you know that's what he wanted to do no matter what you would think of who your God is your God wants to reveal himself to you I mean it wouldn't matter what I was religious belief I was having today I would still want to think that my God wants to speak to me cuz why would the creators I mean we surely like we talking about last night surely we don't want to think that we just rolled around here and fell off of some log you know and this poliwog went from that poliwog to that poliwog to this poliwog and we wound up being human beings well why haven't we evolved any further now the only thing that I ever seen us evolve to is they say we come down from Monkey well I see mankind today he's acting like monkeys that's that maybe he's evolving backwards but it's in his actions it's not in his looks or any of the doings you know they claim we they claim they got these skeletons it's billions of years old and you know they they do all of that but you know them it was back there uh you know they all them skeletons out I've ever seen you know you know what they look like they don't look like monkeys they don't look like something strange they look kind of like we look right we see then why haven't we evolved to something El you but see we've not done it we believe the Bible you say well science can prove this right that's why I thank God for a prophet like his daughter said one day said but Daddy they tell us that the world is billions of years old he said that's right you'd say well no no no the world believes we're here religious World believes we've been here 6,000 years well see that's not what the scripture said that in the beginning he created heavens and earth you know there's a period there not a comma that continues on into another point there's a period that fits there reason that period is there is because in in English you stop and think that was the end of the statement stop and think about it it's not a common to carry on you a comma to carry on it means stop and think we see in the beginning God created heaven and the Earth period he could have left it here for billions of years before he ever done anything we think of him creating the world in seven days or we even try to multiply it up where to think that he was in creation for 7,000 years or 6,000 but just remember how easy it is to confound Man by his own wisdom and that's what God does he takes the wisdom of man and confounds him they can send a rocket into space right they can explore the moon the stars the planets but you know to be able to do that they had to go back and get the Bible you've heard the story right they didn't get none of these other books now to be able to prove this point they went back and got the Bible cuz see in all their calculations and I don't understand how it was calculated that's but all of their calculations is missing one day cuz they can't put all those Rockets out there in space without knowing where they're all going to be cuz they're going to run into each other so they got to put them in an orbit into things and all them so they went back and they studied it and this man said well I remember one day in the Bible that it spoke of a day that the sun Stood Still well now how they done it I don't know but scientifically they ran that back to that date and time and they found out that there was a great vast time missing but it was not one whole day it like I believe I'm right now if I miss it on the number forgive me I believe it was 20 minutes they likeed well they said okay he said we've got you know we're close but we we can't do that cuz 20 minutes would make a vast difference in space to be able to put those Rockets up there that you wouldn't run into each other you know and thing so they said well something still wrong with Miss in 20 minutes they asked the man said was anything else he said well I do remember in the Bible that a man asked God one time to to extend his life he sent the prophet down told him he was going to die and said he he was to he asked God and God extended his life you remember there now somebody give me the name cuz my my memor of name is bad but anyhow the the man said well you know God extend my life he said okay he said I'll extend your life for 15 years right well that's worst mistake he ever made because he sinned if you read your Bible after the end so horrible he been better off he'd died but still he wanted to to do that and he said you remember the story he said well how do I know that God that you're giving me this and he said it would be a very easy thing Lord for you to make time fly forward but said if you would let time go backward and time went backward on that day for so many degrees of their thing and they figured that out and it was exactly 20 minutes that was what they needed to make the one- day mission in their calculations they had to depend upon the Bible you know well if he can keep it that accurate then I believe he can keep all of it accurate that's the way I depend upon the Bible because he can he we can do that see because see in trying to figure the Bible that's why you you can't do it even your Prophet told us do not try to deal with with figuring out times and this that and the other because you got too many calculations I remember studying one time that they changed the calendar system and one time it was changed like three times in one year and to do that to try to line the star systems back up and they put um 13 months into one year to make it line up and that one year only had 200 something days and uh there was just things that science can prove let's see God's clock word is right on time you may have a good watch it may keep real good time but it's going to miss but they took that and they calculated those things and they send those Rockets into space and know within a split second of where they're at that's how smart science is you can't deny there scientific ability but you know that means there has to be a god somewhere that brought that ability to man we all life and read the stories of how Thor invented the wheel you know the cartoon character and but you know what day was somebody invented a wheel and they kept on putting Parks together and they wound up with a car I don't think it was pedaling by bicycle pedals but they wound up and then they wound up getting and they called it horsepower well you know that's always been amazing to me because why would they call an airplane engine or a car engine horsepower the best that I can give you the answer is that that means the thrust are an ability to push and you know so they calculate how much horsepower it would take to push and they got it from the horsepower and you know they still calculates horsepower as to going into outer space sir it takes so much stress power from horsepower to go to outer space well they're still just on the same old thing that we was in the horse and buggy that's right and I don't mean this is a joke but I always told you about it and people don't believe it but everybody says that a mule pulls a plow now you never farmed a mule don't pull up a p it pushes it you see you getting the meal back here with the the stop no no the mule horse or whatever it is it has a collar around its neck on that collar is what you call a gear on that gear is chains connected back to whatever you're pulling and the mule is pushing the plow because he's pushing against the collar that's on his shoulder and by pushing against it he's pulling the plow that's behind you so it is horsepower thrust power but it brings it down to common sense right this Bible is the only thing that's sensible the Bible is the only thing that's sensible the only thing that can give you all the answers all the other books can't do it but the Bible can give you the answer to everything you have need of right if you'll just read it right but it's just like the said what it is the Book of Revelations the reason Satan don't want you to read it because it's telling about you telling what wonderful that God FS with you we'll get to it Wednesday where he gets over one about 13 where he turned to see the seven golden Candlestick and he looked there was one like unto the son of man standing in the seven golden Candlestick G about to pouch with a girdle per this fish the symbolics has been broke to us perhaps it's femin that's the bride of Christ John falls down to worship the bride of Christ you said well that's what they did over end of the book of Revelation but you better hold it now don't hold your thoughts too close to that that just being the bride of Christ over there we've got some things we got to bring out but but the word of God is perfect are you down there yet find out what we doing I'm sorry that we're a little late but you know can't help that but all things work together for good so then there nothing else you're getting the burden of having to sit and listen to me you know talk to you for a while but and us to sing and worship God cuz see why are we here why was man brought here he worshiped a totem pole right cuz he believ that totem pole that an imaginary way his God entered that totem pole that totem pole is not his God that's why the Flesh of Jesus standing on the Earth was the Flesh of a man a man they're down there so we ready to say the prayer okay let's stand together we ready to go eat so everybody stays and eats and we have a good time sorry that we're a little late but we're not going to have an evening service so you don't have to worry about it you can can Fellowship together and have a good time eating that old turkey you know sorry to the turkey because he had to make a a total commitment today that we could be able to eat you know but one of these days we can do like the president he pardoned a couple of them this time but I wonder what's going to happen to them to be pardon you know I never did figure out what went with them did they turn them loose or what do they do you know I mean they're they're raised turkeys you a't going turn them out in a while what do they do with those things I'm sure somewhere or another where he meets his fate but one of these days we don't have to worry about all that we'll be over there and it won't be going killing the turkeys and having to wait for food be a wonderful time father we thank you for today and we're sorry for being a little late but we couldn't help that Lord we ask you to just go with us now as we go eat a natural meal and may our Thanksgiving time be thankful to you for all that you've given unto us cuz look at it look at our lives look at Lord even the clothes we have on our back when 40 years ago we couldn't even afford a shirt go on had holdes and everything and patches on their patches Lord but yet in a 50-year period or something we've been brought from from poverty to to a wonderful fatbelly time we thank you for all with that but most of all we thank you for the the spiritual food that you've given unto us the word of God you revealed
