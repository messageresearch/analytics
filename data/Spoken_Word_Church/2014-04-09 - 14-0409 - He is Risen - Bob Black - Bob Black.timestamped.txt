[3:50] done for you
[3:52] and uh I I just uh let's just go to the
[3:56] author real quick before we go into the
[3:58] word uh we're going to read from Mark
[3:59] chapter 6 verses one through six but
[4:02] let's go to the Lord Lord Jesus we just
[4:04] thank you God for another opportunity to
[4:06] come around your word
[4:08] and God to read about what you've done
[4:11] for us Lord Jesus and read about what

[4:32] be for not Lord God but you made a
[4:35] promise in your word where is it the
[4:37] twos and the threes are gathered
[4:38] together in your name that you would be
[4:40] there and Lord we're trusting in your

[5:00] Minds Lord Jesus that they'll understand
[5:03] Lord the day and the hour that we're
[5:05] living in Lord Jesus granted Lord God
[5:08] that you'll come upon the scene now for
[5:10] us Lord we ask believing Lord in the
[5:12] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[5:14] laughs
[5:15] so let's read our scripture
[5:18] and I uh maybe this I approach this and
[5:22] it may be a little odd way
[5:24] um but let's just read
[5:26] Mark chapter 6 verses 1 through 6.
[5:31] uh
[5:33] I'm sorry Mark 16.
[5:36] I apologize
[5:43] he just kind of hit the ground running
[5:44] and
[5:45] just kind of
[5:49] Mark 16 verses 1 through 6. I even had
[5:53] the text highlighted in this
[5:58] and when the Sabbath was passed Mary
[6:01] Magdalene and Mary the mother of James
[6:03] and Salome had bought sweet spices that
[6:06] they might come and anoint him and very
[6:08] early in the morning
[6:10] they're still interested in anointing
[6:12] and making sure that everything's taken
[6:14] care of
[6:15] making sure that he gets the proper
[6:17] respect and very early in the morning
[6:20] the first day of the week they came
[6:22] under the Sepulcher at the rising of the
[6:24] Sun
[6:25] and they said among themselves
[6:29] who shall roll us away the Stone from
[6:32] the door of the Sepulcher
[6:35] and when they looked they saw that the
[6:37] stone was rolled away for it was very
[6:40] great
[6:41] and entering into the Sepulcher they saw
[6:43] a young man sitting on the right side
[6:45] clothed in a long white garment and they
[6:47] were freited and he saith unto them be
[6:50] not a Friday
[6:51] you seek Jesus of Nazareth which was
[6:55] crucified he is risen he is not here
[6:59] behold the place where they laid him
[7:01] you maybe see the Lord has blessing to
[7:04] the reading of his word
[7:05] now uh
[7:08] you know I feel like and maybe I don't
[7:12] have enough experience to speak on
[7:13] things like this but I feel like when
[7:16] you get behind the pulpit that you
[7:18] really have a a dilemma of of choosing
[7:21] two between two paths that you can
[7:23] either preach what uh something that
[7:26] will make people
[7:27] an impressive sermon a sermon with lots
[7:31] of facts and figures and things that
[7:32] will make people think wow he's he's
[7:35] really he's really all right or you can
[7:38] preach what is needful
[7:41] and I believe that in my heart I don't
[7:43] really know
[7:45] how do I know what is needful because
[7:47] the only one that can know the secrets
[7:49] of all men's Hearts is the almighty God
[7:52] and I'm depending on him tonight to show
[7:55] me what his need for what you need to
[7:57] hear from and and uh that's I believe
[8:02] when you get a real message then it's
[8:05] something that I I didn't get from
[8:07] studying I didn't get from uh just uh
[8:11] you know God gives things in different
[8:13] ways but last last week I was on the
[8:15] train and the train was rocking back and
[8:17] forth and I was riding into work and
[8:19] just the presence of the Lord came down
[8:21] upon the scene and just quickened the
[8:22] scripture to me that if I could take a
[8:25] little Texas morning he is risen and I'm
[8:28] not really smart enough to look and
[8:30] think about what time of the year we are
[8:32] that this is April this is the time of
[8:35] the Resurrection I wish I was that smart
[8:36] to but well I'll preach on his risen
[8:39] because it's that time of the year but
[8:41] it was it was quickened to me and God
[8:44] began to I I heard another Ministry talk
[8:48] about uh you know after he got the Holy
[8:50] Ghost and he'd be laying in the bed or
[8:52] whatever and somebody would begin to
[8:54] preach to him and that's how it is
[8:56] sometimes my prayer tonight is that if I
[9:00] can deliver this the way it was
[9:01] delivered to me and I believe it will be
[9:04] a help to me and I I you know God it's
[9:07] so simple is one of the things that he's
[9:09] so great about him is that he can't take
[9:11] something so
[9:12] it take as great as he is and he can
[9:16] come down and reveal himself in a way
[9:18] that we can understand and maybe one of
[9:21] the most simplest little scriptures in
[9:23] the Bible this morning tonight would be
[9:25] so profound
[9:27] that he is risen now so as I was
[9:31] studying on this scripture and just
[9:33] meditating on it it was just quickened
[9:36] to me to check the date
[9:37] and see what kind of date you know we
[9:39] should be aware of the day and the hour
[9:42] that we're living in and I know my wife
[9:44] and I were talking on the way over here
[9:45] about how uh you know there's there's
[9:47] upcoming four blood moons and Then
[9:50] followed by six full moons and I I don't
[9:52] pretend to understand all the different
[9:54] things but I know that something's
[9:56] happening something's taking place
[9:59] so I looked at the calendar and I I went
[10:01] back and looked at
[10:03] what the the day uh you know brother
[10:08] Branham laid out the dates of the of of
[10:10] the when he said
[10:13] that Jesus wrote into Jerusalem on A.D
[10:16] the uh I believe it was A.D the second
[10:18] and uh he in A.D 30.
[10:22] April I think and and then so he rolled
[10:25] in on Palm Sunday
[10:27] on April the 2nd and April the 4th he
[10:30] preached Matthew 24. and I just put it
[10:34] on the calendar and and then so on
[10:36] Friday he was crucified
[10:38] and then on April the 9th he rose
[10:43] when today is April the 9th you now
[10:46] we're we're not maybe weren't aware of
[10:48] it this morning as you know I woke up
[10:50] this morning I was riding in on a bus
[10:52] and I was thinking
[10:54] 1984 years ago today
[10:57] and you know
[11:00] 1984 years ago today he rose from the
[11:03] grave you can look back and think of
[11:05] what think about that that he rose from
[11:08] the grave today and this this little
[11:11] scripture that we just read
[11:13] took place almost 2 000 years ago as
[11:17] these little sisters came to the tomb
[11:21] and saw that he the angel told them that
[11:25] he's not here he is risen now we're here
[11:29] this afternoon as the hours growing dark
[11:32] physically naturally but you know he
[11:35] said he promised it around about the
[11:38] evening time it would be light
[11:40] now I pray that tonight the the light of
[11:43] his Gospel of the of his of his own self
[11:46] of his own Glory would shine upon us and
[11:48] open up the word to us
[11:50] now
[11:51] when the Sabbath was passed Mary
[11:53] Magdalene and Mary the mother of James
[11:55] and Salome had bought sweet spices that
[11:58] they might come and anoint him they were
[12:00] think about the type of people that came
[12:03] Mary Magdalene who brother random said
[12:04] was you know talk talked about how she
[12:07] was a sinner and the Bible teaches us
[12:09] that she had Seven Devils cast out over
[12:12] this you you know you think about Grace
[12:14] that the the maybe one of the worst
[12:18] people in the New Testament was there
[12:20] the first one that was witness of the
[12:23] Resurrection the first the first to be
[12:26] present and she was just I I was reading
[12:29] the different commentaries and one said
[12:31] that she was an apostle to the apostles
[12:33] because of you know she kind of took the
[12:37] message she was one of the ones that was
[12:38] first on the scene and she took the
[12:40] message and ran with it he is risen of
[12:44] course nobody believed her at the first
[12:45] but she took it and and she was there in
[12:48] prison on the scene but I want to take a
[12:51] just for my topic he has risen what is
[12:55] the evidence that he has risen now if we
[12:59] were 2 000 years later I I think we say
[13:03] have the same kind of dilemma that they
[13:06] had back then
[13:08] you know they were concerned that they
[13:11] they came up to this point in their life
[13:13] looking for something expecting
[13:16] something that uh maybe the the way it
[13:20] turned out was a whole lot different
[13:21] than what they expected
[13:23] and they uh you know I imagine as they
[13:27] stood at the feet of Jesus on the cross
[13:29] looking up and and thinking I believe
[13:31] that this was the Messiah I believe that
[13:33] this was the one to come and Deliver us
[13:36] and they looked up and they stood at the
[13:38] feet of the Cross and you married
[13:39] Magdalene was one of the last her and
[13:42] John as they stood there and Jesus
[13:44] looked down and said woman Behold thy
[13:47] mother and and gave Mary over to John's
[13:51] care and all those different things took
[13:53] place at the cross but right there it
[13:56] something maybe it was a critical moment
[13:59] in their life the the everything began
[14:03] to come to a head and they uh what is
[14:07] what is happening what is taking place
[14:10] now as Mary Magdalene and Mary the
[14:13] mother of James and Salome they came at
[14:16] this particular Junction in time and you
[14:18] know brother Branham teaches us that all
[14:20] of these little people in the Bible as
[14:23] they came to decision points in their
[14:25] life they would look back at other
[14:28] people in the Bible
[14:29] for help and they would look back and
[14:32] and identify themselves in the scripture
[14:35] with someone else
[14:37] and maybe if I could just paint a little
[14:39] picture maybe they identified themselves
[14:42] at this particular maybe they remembered
[14:44] back that story of of Lazarus and Mary
[14:47] and Martha as they came to a similar
[14:50] Junction in time and you know remember
[14:52] about how brother Branham told that
[14:53] story of how Martha how when Lazarus was
[14:57] sick became sick and how he he passed
[15:00] away and Martha maybe she was going
[15:02] through a time in her life where she
[15:04] wasn't such a strong Christian anymore
[15:06] she was going through a little wobbly
[15:08] time of her life and sometimes that's
[15:10] how God does this he'll throw us into a
[15:13] situation pull the ground out from under
[15:15] us to see if we still believe him if we
[15:18] still take him at his word
[15:21] and and so she had the ground pulled out
[15:24] from under her she her brother was going
[15:26] into the ground and and why is Jesus
[15:29] taking so long what is taking so long
[15:32] and when he arrived because everything
[15:34] was just perfectly in line with his time
[15:37] with his great plan and purpose
[15:38] everything was moving just according to
[15:41] plan and you know the Bible says you say
[15:44] that God is is slumbering and sleeping
[15:47] and waiting but the clock is ticking
[15:49] even now just according to his great
[15:51] plan and purpose it's moving along just
[15:54] fine he's not delaying his coming
[15:57] and so he he arrived upon the scene and
[16:00] Martha didn't jump at him and and uh get
[16:03] down his throat or anything she jumped
[16:06] down his throat but she said uh Lord if
[16:09] you would have been here and I I I think
[16:12] so often you know no matter what
[16:14] circumstance a real true Christian if
[16:16] you've got that Rod of faith that that's
[16:19] just anchored so far deep down and you
[16:22] you always say no matter what the
[16:24] circumstance Lord Lord even now if you
[16:27] would if you would have been here if
[16:29] you'll say it Lord I believe and I was
[16:32] thinking about how you know as we come
[16:34] up to be prayed for you know I think one
[16:36] of the biggest uh don't take me the
[16:39] wrong way almost one of the biggest
[16:40] slaps in the face of the lord it's to
[16:43] it's to come up Time After Time Lord
[16:46] Heal Me of whatever I have need of I'm
[16:49] coming for healing I accept my healing
[16:51] and then go back to our seed and the
[16:52] next Sunday come right back up because
[16:54] we're denying what God has done for us
[16:57] if he'll claim what he said he'll do if
[16:59] he'll take him at his word and say Lord
[17:01] even now you're able to do it even now
[17:04] Lord if you would have if you would Lord
[17:06] just I believe that you're still able to
[17:08] come upon a scene and heal and deliver
[17:11] I believe that you're still able Lord
[17:14] and so
[17:16] Mary uh
[17:18] Martha there at that little conversation
[17:22] that she had with Jesus Lord even now
[17:25] and he said your brother will rise again
[17:29] he'll rise again because you know they
[17:32] they all believed that the Pharisees
[17:34] believed in the resurrection they had
[17:36] that and uh he said she'll he'll rise
[17:39] again
[17:40] and see she said surely Laura in the
[17:43] resurrection he's been he's been a good
[17:46] fella he's been a nice nice good
[17:48] churchgoer all those things he's been
[17:51] wonderful but surely I believe that I
[17:54] believe the gospel that he'll rise again
[17:56] I understand I have an understanding of
[17:58] these tenets of the faith and he said I
[18:02] am the resurrection and the life and he
[18:04] went out and he went out to the grave
[18:07] and rolled they rolled back the stone
[18:08] and that putrid smell came out and it
[18:12] just about knocked everybody over
[18:14] and he stood there and he called forth
[18:17] that voice called forth Lazarus you know
[18:20] you can read stories like that and and
[18:22] uh I I think oftentimes you can listen
[18:25] to the sermons that the prophet preached
[18:28] and there's uh get an understanding of
[18:31] the power of God and different things
[18:33] but then you can just keep going down
[18:35] and down and until there's a deeper a
[18:38] revelation in there and even in that
[18:39] little story how Martha Jesus called
[18:42] Mary
[18:44] through and he told Martha to go get her
[18:46] she answered the call she answered the
[18:48] shout and then the voice raised up
[18:50] Lazarus from the grave and then in the
[18:52] next chapter we read how they were all
[18:54] called to a wedding supper they were all
[18:56] called that the trumpet calls us to the
[18:58] wedding supper in Disguise you can see a
[19:01] deeper in in that little simple story
[19:04] something deeper and deeper
[19:07] but as you just keep listening to the
[19:09] prophet you listen you get like a a a a
[19:12] basic understanding about the power of
[19:15] God and then you keep listening and you
[19:16] get deeper and deeper until you begin to
[19:19] see things that we were on the way up to
[19:21] church tonight we were listening to the
[19:23] token and I I was thinking I feel like
[19:26] you know years ago I didn't understand
[19:28] half of what I understand now because
[19:31] it's not something that I've I've
[19:33] learned just by by studying like I'm in
[19:36] school but something that's been
[19:37] quickened inside of me that I I'm
[19:39] becoming identified with a message I'm
[19:42] identified with what he's talking about
[19:44] the token is becoming alive in me
[19:48] and so Mary Magdalene and Martin and
[19:53] Mary
[19:54] they came to the tomb and the angel and
[19:57] I I believe it's Luke and the different
[19:59] stories that one one will say one Angel
[20:02] and another two angels but that angel
[20:04] came and delivered unto them a message
[20:07] delivered them the message that he has
[20:10] risen and you know angels are
[20:12] ministering Spirits because God sends
[20:14] forth Angels because he is concerned
[20:16] about our welfare and angels are
[20:19] concerned about whether we hear the
[20:21] truth or not and what we do with it
[20:23] angels are ministering to us I was
[20:25] reading a little a little quote where
[20:26] brother random was talking about how he
[20:28] it was a long line of people waiting to
[20:30] be prayed for outside his home and he
[20:32] went up to the line and and was just
[20:35] going down and there was a man in the
[20:36] line with a flat nose and the man told
[20:39] him uh he looked up at him quickly and
[20:42] he said uh don't go or you know he
[20:44] advised I forget exactly what the advice
[20:46] he gave him was but he said go over
[20:47] there here and and do such and such in
[20:50] his Quick List brother random looked at
[20:51] him he disappeared
[20:53] and angels are among us and you may not
[20:55] even be aware of it and brother Branham
[20:57] wasn't aware when he was going down that
[20:59] line of people waiting to be prayed for
[21:01] that there was a man that looked just
[21:04] like a flat nose but
[21:06] angels are are angels are concerned
[21:09] about us and concerned about whether we
[21:12] hear the gospel or not and now uh uh
[21:15] there's three you know you can look at
[21:18] the three different angels that kind of
[21:21] play a role in your life first there's
[21:22] the angel of the Lord that appeared over
[21:24] brother Brandon's head in that in that
[21:26] Houston Coliseum that we have a picture
[21:28] of and you can put that picture on your
[21:30] mantle and say there is a picture of the
[21:32] Angel of the Lord and they come on down
[21:34] and there was the angel of the church
[21:36] age the messenger to the church age that
[21:38] brought us to revealed us these Hidden
[21:41] Truths that were hidden down Through the
[21:43] Ages and now remained on to us and then
[21:45] you also have another Angel which is you
[21:49] know you remember I said in another
[21:51] sermon a while back that God has a
[21:53] trickle-down economy he reveals it up up
[21:56] high and it comes trickling down from
[21:58] one to the other to the other the other
[22:00] and you can give it to your children you
[22:02] can give it as it's trickle down to you
[22:04] now there's the angel of the Lord
[22:06] there's the angel of the church
[22:08] age and there's also the angel of the
[22:11] church
[22:12] when the angel of the church is
[22:14] concerned about your well-being he's
[22:16] concerned that you hear the truth he's
[22:19] concerned that you give your life to the
[22:21] Lord and now the angel
[22:24] the Angels gave a message
[22:27] to Mary and Martha to marry Magdalene
[22:30] and Mary the mother of James and Salome
[22:32] that he is risen
[22:35] now
[22:39] you know uh
[22:42] you are all the different people in this
[22:45] church that I'm looking at this morning
[22:46] are special assignments from God
[22:49] from the up from the Angels God has
[22:53] given into the Angels charge to to bring
[22:56] you to the gospel to bring you to a
[22:58] revelation to a closer walk with God
[23:01] and
[23:03] you know the angels are concerned about
[23:05] your well-being they're ministering
[23:08] spirits to The Heirs of the Kingdom and
[23:10] The Heirs of the kingdom are the ones
[23:12] here that are sitting listening and you
[23:15] know I think it's interesting that uh
[23:18] you know a minister is many times
[23:21] ministers will try to elevate themselves
[23:24] and say I'm so much higher than you but
[23:26] here's what a minister does a minister
[23:29] feeds the people and you know there's
[23:32] one standing tonight but all the others
[23:34] are seated at the table of life and I I
[23:37] feel honored to be able to serve you as
[23:40] a minister of the Gospel to serve you of
[23:42] the table of life and you as you sit and
[23:45] are waited upon wait uh you know brother
[23:50] Roundup priest who is this Melchizedek
[23:52] and you know melchizer that came down in
[23:54] flesh so that he could Minister and wash
[23:58] the feet of the disciples so that he
[24:00] could he he humbled himself and told us
[24:03] that we should do the same thing we
[24:05] should behave ourselves in the same way
[24:07] there's no big eyes and a little use
[24:09] it's all we're all in this fight
[24:12] together running this race to try to get
[24:14] to the end to try to accomplish what's
[24:17] written in God's word
[24:18] now
[24:21] let me let me see where I am
[24:25] oh
[24:26] now so here you him uh I mean sorry he
[24:30] is risen
[24:32] he is risen uh
[24:36] what is the evidence
[24:38] what is the evidence that he has risen
[24:43] so now
[24:44] I want to kind of go through this
[24:46] scripture Mark 16 there's a few little
[24:49] things that happen in this scripture
[24:51] now the first thing that happens and
[24:54] we'll kind of go through them one by one
[24:55] the first thing that happens is that the
[24:58] angel testifies that he has risen
[25:01] and you know I think what I want to kind
[25:03] of do is compare what happens in each of
[25:06] these little situations with what the
[25:09] true evidence that he has risen is and
[25:13] we'll kind of look at these now as I'm
[25:15] speaking to you and
[25:18] I believe I pray bring forth the word of
[25:21] life
[25:23] speaking it you know you have a decision
[25:25] that you can either accept it or reject
[25:29] it you have uh you can uh take it and
[25:33] and run with it or say well I you know
[25:36] that was pretty good that was a good
[25:38] motivational speech or whatever but I I
[25:41] don't I'm not thoroughly convinced
[25:45] but now when you hear an angel speaking
[25:48] a lot of times
[25:49] I I I believe that a lot of times today
[25:53] many people will take hearing the angel
[25:57] as the evidence that he has risen but
[26:01] just hearing the Angels speak is not the
[26:04] evidence that he is risen the angel was
[26:07] convinced and he had evidence within
[26:11] himself but that is not the evidence
[26:13] just hearing the angel say He Is Risen
[26:16] now you can hear the message and have it
[26:19] sitting in your home with the Bible open
[26:20] the the tapes playing and you can hear
[26:23] the angel
[26:25] of the the angel of the church age
[26:27] speaking out crying out you can hear
[26:30] that angel of the Lord speaking out
[26:32] through him and you can say you can nod
[26:35] your head that's right but that is not
[26:39] the evidence that he is risen and I
[26:42] believe when you know we have a mandate
[26:44] that the evidence is to agree with every
[26:47] word I don't believe that agreeing is
[26:49] just nodding your head I don't believe
[26:51] it it's just saying yeah that's pretty
[26:53] good because you know this little simple
[26:56] scripture you can take it he is risen
[26:59] and I can tell somebody I can have a
[27:01] personal revelation in my own life that
[27:04] he is risen and I know he's written
[27:06] reason not because of what's on the
[27:08] paper and I can go and I can tell
[27:10] somebody else I believe that he has
[27:12] risen and they can say that sounds
[27:14] reasonable that sounds pretty good I
[27:17] believe I I believe that I agree with
[27:20] that but that's not the agreeing the way
[27:23] that the prophet taught it right that's
[27:25] not the agreeing because you are not
[27:27] thoroughly you don't have a personal
[27:29] experience that he has risen you're not
[27:32] you're not there's not something that's
[27:34] bolted down an anchor that you know
[27:36] beyond a shadow of doubt you know I was
[27:39] reading there's so many books written
[27:41] today proven whether or not he's risen
[27:43] or not uh I I I've got one that somebody
[27:46] gave me that's like 500 pages long and
[27:49] to be honest I hadn't had time to to
[27:51] even dip in it it goes into so much
[27:54] proven about this person's where this
[27:56] person's bones were buried and the
[27:58] Engravings on this different things like
[28:01] that but you can have a head knowledge
[28:04] that won't take you to the real
[28:06] Revelation that he is risen and that's
[28:10] what I'm speaking of this tonight that
[28:12] there's an Evidence there's a true
[28:14] evidence that he is risen and it's not
[28:17] found in knowledge and
[28:20] and you know uh you do the baptism of
[28:24] the Holy Ghost is the opening of the
[28:26] word and those kind of things and I'm
[28:27] I'm speaking of you know I was looking
[28:30] at um
[28:31] in the early
[28:33] in the early church ages uh around about
[28:35] the time of the first church age the
[28:37] irenius and Polly Corp and all those
[28:39] there was something that rose up called
[28:42] gnosticism and the whole the whole thing
[28:45] about gnosticism was that it was they
[28:47] they preached salvation by knowledge
[28:50] they preached that all of these that
[28:53] there was a group a core of of Believers
[28:56] that had this secret mystery that was
[29:00] being unveiled only to them and if you
[29:03] were part of that secret little group
[29:05] then they would teach you uh how to
[29:08] escape the bonds of this flesh to that
[29:11] the whole natural creation was something
[29:13] to be escaped from now see how close how
[29:17] close it sounds now we're not we're
[29:20] we're our goal is is to not leave this
[29:24] body behind laying down on the ground
[29:26] but this body must be must take on
[29:29] immortality it must be changed to take
[29:32] on immortality to be like him and that's
[29:35] what our goal is and it's not by just
[29:38] memorization by by just by theology by
[29:43] scholarly exercises but it's by the it's
[29:47] it's it's by a revelation it's by the
[29:50] revealing of his word it's by a personal
[29:52] experience that he has risen and you
[29:56] know uh
[29:58] I was thinking you know brother Dale in
[30:01] the Bible study mentioned
[30:02] that Moses Mama probably told him
[30:06] as they were or you know brother Brown
[30:09] did talk about that that Moses Mama
[30:11] educated him as they were as they would
[30:12] grow as he was growing up and told him
[30:14] who he was and and what he was raised up
[30:17] for and told him all those things but
[30:19] you know when it came down to to
[30:22] actually fulfilling what was prophesied
[30:26] and all all the different things that
[30:28] were said about him he tried to do it
[30:31] himself right
[30:32] he tried to make it work himself and
[30:36] that's one thing that uh behold I show
[30:40] you a mystery let me say it like that
[30:41] you can't do it yourself
[30:45] you can't you can try you can try to
[30:48] learn and study but until God drops down
[30:50] and opens up his word uh you won't have
[30:54] a full understanding of this of the
[30:56] scripture like that that little story we
[30:58] were showing of of of Mary and Martha
[31:01] and how there's such there's deeper
[31:03] meaning in the word there's deeper
[31:04] things that you can pull out that not
[31:07] you can pull out but God can show you
[31:09] like the little story of Arthur Neil and
[31:12] oxa that we looked at in Sunday school
[31:14] about how God revealing himself and his
[31:16] bride little little things in his
[31:18] scripture that that speak to you and
[31:20] show you how uh show you more about your
[31:23] relationship with him
[31:25] because you know that's really what the
[31:27] Bible is unveiling is him the seven of
[31:30] seals don't reveal us it reveals him and
[31:33] what he's doing in us and
[31:39] let me find out where I am a second hold
[31:41] on
[31:43] so Moses as he was being brought up his
[31:46] mama would tell him you know you're
[31:49] you're you are the deliverer you got a
[31:52] special purpose in life you're not like
[31:54] these other people you're not you you
[31:56] know when I was when I was being brought
[31:58] up I was told the same thing I was you
[32:00] not there's a reason why we don't
[32:02] fellowship with you know go to
[32:04] denominations and and uh there's a
[32:07] reason why we're different there's a
[32:09] there's a it's time we listen to tapes
[32:11] and we heard about it and and bible
[32:15] studies and devotionals every night and
[32:17] and those kind of things but that didn't
[32:20] that isn't what
[32:22] that wasn't just hearing it wasn't the
[32:25] evidence that he has risen for me and
[32:28] one day Moses had to come to his own and
[32:31] own personal experience now the same
[32:33] thing with with maybe Jacob's father
[32:36] telling him that about how all the
[32:39] different things that happened in his
[32:41] life and
[32:42] maybe Isaac's saying I remember when my
[32:44] father took me down to the bush and and
[32:46] uh tied me to The Altar and tied me up
[32:50] on it and maybe he lifted up his hand to
[32:53] strike me with the knife and I I just
[32:55] lay there because I knew I trusted him
[32:57] that everything that he was being led of
[32:59] the Lord to do whatever whatever was
[33:01] happening it was led he was led to the
[33:03] Lord and I I just I just put everything
[33:06] into into the hands of the Lord and
[33:09] waited to see what would happen and as
[33:10] he lifted up his knife and Angel stayed
[33:13] his hand and and God provided a
[33:15] sacrifice there and you know all those
[33:18] all those stories came back to Jacob but
[33:21] the stories just just sitting in church
[33:26] and saying I'm part of this was not an
[33:29] evidence that he was risen
[33:33] and you know the sons of Zebedee as they
[33:37] sat on their boat fishing you know they
[33:39] were all they all had a little company
[33:41] together with Peter and Andrew the sons
[33:43] of James and John and and Peter and
[33:45] Andrew they all had a little fishing
[33:46] party together and they worked together
[33:48] and one day Jesus came down walking and
[33:51] and gave him a little call but you know
[33:53] I believe that they were prepared for
[33:55] that ahead of time by their uh Zebedee
[33:58] speaking to him and teaching them that
[34:01] one day there's going to come a messiah
[34:03] and you'd be looking for him when he
[34:04] does come and when he comes he's going
[34:07] to do like this he's not going to
[34:09] deviate from the word he's going to be
[34:10] able to open the word he's not going to
[34:12] uh he's gonna you know be straight and
[34:15] blunt and he's gonna say it like it is
[34:18] and he's gonna he uh prepared prepare
[34:21] them for the for the day
[34:24] when they would be have that choice but
[34:27] now all of those things all of those
[34:30] things are good and needful we need to
[34:32] hear the word but you know and I I speak
[34:36] this because
[34:38] you know today a lot of uh is going
[34:41] around that that um
[34:44] just here in the message just awakens in
[34:47] you that you always were Eternal that
[34:50] that you just have a uh that just
[34:54] hearing it is not the evidence that he
[34:56] has risen and the evidence that that is
[34:59] not the evidence is because you can look
[35:01] around today and see men and women that
[35:03] have been in the message for 20 and 30
[35:05] years and now they're falling away if
[35:08] they heard it and believed it back then
[35:09] why did they not continue on and now
[35:12] that's that's the the a real true
[35:15] Christian experience will always move
[35:17] because as the light shining from the
[35:19] East to the West is moving the Believers
[35:22] are moving along with it from
[35:23] justification to sanctification and if
[35:26] you stop anywhere along the way then
[35:28] you'll follow you'll you know Paul
[35:30] talked about how we're running a race
[35:32] and the race is not with each other this
[35:35] race is a peculiar race it's a race with
[35:38] only one person in it and your goal is
[35:40] not to beat the other people your goal
[35:43] is to finish it and you finish it by
[35:46] continuing on keeping on through God's
[35:50] plan without taking any shortcuts we're
[35:52] going on through justification
[35:54] sanctification batches but holy ghost
[35:56] and walking in the word until you meet
[35:59] the prize which is the change of your
[36:01] body
[36:02] now
[36:04] so what
[36:06] what is the evidence
[36:09] of he is risen
[36:16] and I want to skip over
[36:19] to Luke
[36:23] I'm kind of combining some of these
[36:24] stories
[36:25] some of the ways that they were told
[36:31] Luke chapter 24.
[36:35] because
[36:36] you know each of these four brothers
[36:39] that wrote Matthew Mark Luke and John
[36:42] that the uh
[36:44] the veil and the temple
[36:48] you know we you can kind of compare that
[36:51] with Matthew Mark and Luke and John it
[36:53] that Matthew Mark and Luke John are
[36:55] presenting Christ in four different ways
[36:58] kind of looking at him from four
[37:00] different angles you know let's look at
[37:02] it from a servant let's look at it from
[37:04] from as almighty god let's see what he
[37:06] looks like as as the lion of the tribe
[37:09] of Judah and it you can kind of turn
[37:11] around and and and just so we get a full
[37:14] complete picture a full complete view so
[37:18] that we have full understanding as we
[37:19] move on into the book of Acts where the
[37:22] New Testament begins
[37:24] and uh Luke 24
[37:28] 36.
[37:34] and we're moving through
[37:37] the the kind of the different stages of
[37:39] this of this journey as they came to the
[37:41] tomb
[37:42] and an angel delivered a message that he
[37:44] has risen
[37:46] he delivered a message
[37:48] and then
[37:50] they took that message and I'm skipping
[37:53] over a little bit they took that message
[37:54] and ran back and told the disciples he
[37:56] is risen and they they walked with on
[37:59] their hearts burned within them on the
[38:00] road to Emmaus as they they fellowship
[38:02] with him and they uh they they didn't
[38:04] realize that he was in their presence
[38:06] and then kind of skipping on down to
[38:08] Luke 24 36
[38:11] and as they dissipate Jesus himself
[38:14] stood in the midst of them and say it
[38:16] unto them peace be unto you
[38:19] peace now Jesus they they were they were
[38:22] not they they were all doubtful
[38:25] they were not fully convinced that he
[38:27] was risen and so Jesus himself stood in
[38:32] their midst
[38:33] and said unto them peace be unto you and
[38:35] what was their response
[38:37] they were
[38:39] filled with power fear ready to go ready
[38:42] to run but they were terrified and
[38:45] afraided and supposed that they had seen
[38:47] a spirit
[38:49] and he said unto them why are you
[38:51] troubled and why do thoughts arise in
[38:53] your hearts behold my hands and my feet
[38:56] that it is I myself handle me and see
[39:00] for a spirit hath not Flesh and Bones as
[39:02] you see me have
[39:04] and when he had thus spoken he showed
[39:07] them his hands and his feet and over in
[39:11] one of the other gospels talks about how
[39:13] they handled his feet they handled him
[39:15] and touched him and could see that he
[39:17] was there because he was their present
[39:19] among them he was present with him now
[39:22] so that's the next thing I want to talk
[39:24] about first they heard a message an
[39:27] angel delivered them the message and
[39:29] next they got in the presence he was
[39:32] among them he was with them but was that
[39:36] the evidence now that now that you could
[39:40] say it's an evidence for them now don't
[39:43] get don't get confused in your mind
[39:44] don't get all wrapped up remember what
[39:47] I'm speaking of because today on this
[39:50] day two thousand years ago almost he
[39:52] rose from the grave but today we need an
[39:55] Evidence and he can't come physically
[39:57] among us today and and he won't you know
[40:00] he he won't come physically walking down
[40:03] the aisle of this church today but we
[40:05] still have to have an evidence that he
[40:08] is risen and that's what I'm speaking of
[40:10] now now look my the maybe the the main
[40:13] point that I'm trying trying to hit up
[40:15] on is his presence now when brother
[40:18] Brandon had prayer lines he could say he
[40:20] I was reading where he said he told one
[40:23] lady you can feel the anointing come on
[40:25] me
[40:26] they could feel the anointing come on
[40:29] him as they were at the in the prayer
[40:31] line they got in that atmosphere and
[40:34] they got in that presence and then many
[40:36] times they would walk off of the
[40:38] platform away from that presence and
[40:41] lose their healing they didn't they they
[40:44] would uh their faith would Wane they
[40:47] would uh get away from that atmosphere
[40:50] and uh instead of continuing on
[40:54] believing they uh got away from that
[40:57] presence now look what uh whenever the
[41:01] disciples got into that presence
[41:04] remember brother Brandon told about that
[41:05] story how they they uh began to go
[41:08] across the Sea of Galilee and he how he
[41:10] walked up into the mountain and he
[41:12] looked down on them
[41:14] and watched because he knew as soon as
[41:16] they got away from that presence as soon
[41:19] as they got away just like how we get
[41:21] away we'll get away you start letting
[41:24] little the little foxes that spoil the
[41:26] vine get in our life and as soon as that
[41:28] happens the devil begins to attack us
[41:30] and begins to kind of have more of his
[41:33] way with us and so Jesus went up on the
[41:35] mountain to watch and see what would
[41:37] happen is they went across that that the
[41:39] Sea of Galilee and he looked and the
[41:42] storm came up and the the winds and the
[41:45] waves began to roll and they saw Jesus
[41:47] come walking upon the water and instead
[41:50] of being comforted my goodness this man
[41:53] I know he's God because he's walking
[41:56] upon the Water they they were scared
[41:59] they thought he was a spook and that's
[42:02] how a lot of times people today they
[42:04] they're afraid of what will help them if
[42:08] they think that uh what's going on in in
[42:10] a believing church is is spooky and
[42:13] scary and and uh afraid of the way
[42:17] people act that if I get among them what
[42:20] if I what if I let out a big shout when
[42:22] the spirit comes down what if I what if
[42:24] I were to jump up and running around a
[42:26] little bit or what if you know what you
[42:28] get into a church where where the the
[42:31] presence Falls and people do begin to
[42:33] shout and it's a little bit uh maybe
[42:37] frightening to someone
[42:39] unaccustomed to that but now
[42:42] when when you really have a real
[42:45] experience
[42:46] something changes it's not spooky
[42:49] anymore it's not scary it's not you you
[42:53] something something changes now now my
[42:56] point is to not just just being around
[42:59] the Revival
[43:01] is not an evidence that he is risen
[43:04] because you know when they went over and
[43:06] asked that little Welsh policeman where
[43:08] is the Revival he didn't say over there
[43:10] he didn't say well my pastor has the
[43:13] Revelation as long as he understands
[43:15] what's going on that's good enough for
[43:17] me but he said I am the Revival what's
[43:21] going on is happening right here
[43:23] now you know the presence of the Lord I
[43:27] don't want you to misunderstand me it is
[43:29] uh critical and crucial because as those
[43:32] people will come up into the prayer line
[43:34] and come into the presence of that angel
[43:36] of the Lord they began to realize that
[43:39] God is real that God
[43:42] God wants to heal you that his desire is
[43:46] to see us to see us well to see us
[43:49] moving and and and and doing well his
[43:52] his presence brings Hope just like it
[43:55] did when Martha saw Jesus coming and
[43:58] Lord if you would have been here now she
[44:01] had she didn't have faith to know what
[44:03] would happen but she had hope that now
[44:05] you know everything's gonna be okay I
[44:07] don't know why Jesus waited but you know
[44:10] now Lazarus isn't in the ground and
[44:12] everything whether he's is is it's just
[44:15] meant for him to stay in the ground or
[44:16] not I believe everything will be okay
[44:18] but Lord I know that if you would have
[44:20] been here then he wouldn't have died
[44:23] now so don't it you know we say your the
[44:28] experience is not based on sensation but
[44:31] don't grow out throw out the feelings
[44:33] exactly because you know it's good when
[44:36] you when you get along with God
[44:37] sometimes you feel that presence of the
[44:39] Lord come down and you feel the feeling
[44:42] then that is that is a good thing that
[44:46] we're not based upon feelings but
[44:48] feelings are good I tell you when I when
[44:51] I was on that on that train and and the
[44:53] presence of the Lord came down and
[44:54] quickened this little scripture to me
[44:56] and and uh you know I I was wiping the
[44:59] tears away you know people are going to
[45:01] think I'm crying on the train for what
[45:04] in the world but now the feeling then
[45:07] was really good
[45:08] but that's not what I'm basing my
[45:11] experience on because
[45:13] you know you got five you're you're
[45:17] trying made up of of Body Spirit and
[45:20] soul
[45:21] and on the outside you got five senses
[45:24] and on the inside the spirit realm
[45:26] you've got five senses but on the inside
[45:28] the inside of the inside of the Soul
[45:30] you only have one sense
[45:33] you don't have that's why it's not by us
[45:36] all this sensation and everything
[45:37] because when you get deep down there's
[45:40] only one sense do you believe it or not
[45:42] it's either Faith or doubt that's you
[45:45] can have all the chills and all the
[45:46] emotion and everything on the outside
[45:48] but when it comes down to a new birth
[45:50] experience it's either do you believe it
[45:53] it it has has the faith of God come down
[45:57] and is living inside of you to give you
[46:00] his faith
[46:01] so don't stop don't stop at the presence
[46:04] that's right don't throw away the Good
[46:06] Feeling Just because it's not based on
[46:08] feelings don't throw the baby out with a
[46:10] bath water
[46:12] now now look now as Israel was
[46:15] journeying through the wilderness
[46:18] you know you could compare their
[46:19] experience
[46:20] with with what happened with Balaam now
[46:23] look they uh they uh they had
[46:27] Balaam had seven altars seven bull looks
[46:30] seven rounds seven seven sacrifices
[46:33] seven burning sacrifices they had a
[46:36] prophet that God was speaking through
[46:38] but there was something different that
[46:41] Prophet wasn't willing to stay a hundred
[46:43] percent with the word god whatever
[46:45] whatever you know that's one thing I I I
[46:49] find amazing is that I believe that
[46:51] brother Branham brother Brandon was not
[46:53] forced to believe to bring this message
[46:55] to us he had a choice he had a choice
[46:58] just like all of us and he he laid down
[47:01] his life for us he he would say goodbye
[47:03] to his kids and travel all around the
[47:05] world and his maybe his kids get on the
[47:08] phone and crying for their daddy but he
[47:10] left all of that for us to bring us the
[47:13] gospel he didn't have to do that and you
[47:16] know look at look at the choice that
[47:17] Baylor made he he wasn't forced to
[47:21] choose wrongly but he he chose money and
[47:25] and fame and popularity and all the
[47:28] things instead of choosing he he say
[47:31] like this way he got up behind the
[47:32] pulpit and instead of choosing what was
[47:35] needful he chose what would bring him
[47:37] popularity he chose poorly on that
[47:40] crossroads of The Minister's dilemma
[47:43] and
[47:45] you know I
[47:47] all of these little types and shadows I
[47:50] think are just we all these types and
[47:53] shadows were speaking of something
[47:55] all these little stories that we read
[47:57] about all of them are leading up to
[47:59] today this very hour that we're you know
[48:02] be aware of the hour and the day that
[48:04] you're living in as we look and remember
[48:06] that on this day Christ Rose and all
[48:09] these types and shadows that were spoken
[48:11] of all down through scripture were
[48:13] leading up we're pointing to the day
[48:15] that there will not be any types or
[48:18] Shadows after you know we're standing at
[48:21] a at a at a moment in time where we're
[48:24] not you know their lives type something
[48:27] as as Mo when Moses came to the burning
[48:30] bush that typed the bad a personal
[48:33] experience that type something but your
[48:36] life is not typing something because it
[48:39] is the reality is the living reality of
[48:42] what all the previous all the previous
[48:44] people in the Bible spoke about
[48:48] so now Moses had been told about God he
[48:52] had been instructed
[48:54] and he had been taught
[48:56] just like Mary and Martha or Martha and
[49:00] are the two Mary's that and Salome that
[49:03] came to the tomb were taught by that
[49:05] angel
[49:06] and but then that teaching had to come
[49:09] to he had to come to a personal
[49:12] experience with God where one day he met
[49:15] that Pillar of Fire for himself and saw
[49:18] for himself something became real and
[49:20] then he wasn't afraid to go down into
[49:23] Egypt he was he took us instead of
[49:26] taking a great big army he took his
[49:28] little wife and his child and bundled
[49:31] them all up together and went down to
[49:32] Egypt that's why you know uh be careful
[49:35] when you let your kids learn about
[49:36] things from the Ten Commandments movie
[49:38] because there's a lot of things in that
[49:40] that aren't exactly accurate that's one
[49:42] of them that they uh he he took a little
[49:44] wife and a child down into Egypt and
[49:48] you know Jacob had been told about the
[49:51] angel he'd been told about the things
[49:53] that happened to his his dad and all and
[49:56] the things that happened to his
[49:57] grandfather but one day he met the angel
[50:00] himself and he wrestled with him and he
[50:02] got the blessing and after that after he
[50:04] wrestled with that angel he never walked
[50:06] again because the angel touched him in
[50:07] his side and caused that ligament to to
[50:10] to deform a little bit he he never
[50:12] walked the same and you'll never walk
[50:14] the same once you meet that same angel
[50:18] and you know the sons of Zebedee that
[50:20] Zebedee told them about told them about
[50:23] the master and and told them about the
[50:25] plan and everything but one day that man
[50:27] came walking down the shores of Galilee
[50:29] and said follow me and you know what
[50:31] they didn't have to say uh let me go
[50:35] talk to my daddy about it and make sure
[50:36] but you know they dropped I believe that
[50:39] day that business went out of business
[50:41] because they dropped everything and they
[50:43] went and followed him because that's the
[50:45] way of a True Believer is that you leave
[50:48] everything you uh any encumbrance
[50:51] anything that would wait the waste has
[50:54] so easily beset us that ties down to the
[50:56] things of the world you'll leave those
[50:59] things behind and I'm not advocating
[51:02] foolish living foolishness or anything
[51:04] but you understand what I'm speaking of
[51:08] ha
[51:10] and but you know all those things that
[51:12] they that happened in the Old Testament
[51:14] as Moses at the burning bush Jacob
[51:17] wrestling with an angel those were types
[51:19] of a personal experience
[51:21] they didn't really have the new birth
[51:24] inside of the Christ Living inside of
[51:26] them because for that to happen God
[51:28] won't dwell in an unclean vessel and
[51:30] first the atonement had to be made so
[51:32] that they could be clean so that he
[51:34] could come and live inside first first
[51:36] you must be Sanctified and washed and uh
[51:40] and I say that too because I'm beginning
[51:42] to realize how many people today believe
[51:45] that the uh oh my that in the Old
[51:49] Testament they had exactly the same we
[51:52] do that in the New Testament it's just a
[51:54] realization that it's not just a
[51:57] realization it's not just an Awakening
[51:59] it's not just a uh just uh like a the
[52:03] gnostics believe that it's just a you're
[52:05] coming to the realization of a mystery
[52:08] that that way that you're saved by
[52:11] knowledge but God God Reveals His
[52:14] secrets to us when we get the Holy Ghost
[52:16] and that's a different kind a different
[52:18] kind of knowledge knowledge not learned
[52:20] by by uh
[52:22] theology not learned by you know
[52:26] Augustine and origen and all those in
[52:29] the you could read their writings and
[52:31] they had some some amazing things to say
[52:34] and and very uh
[52:36] theological and laid out but you know
[52:38] there's a quote where brother random
[52:40] said it's not how you lay it out like
[52:42] that like not like that when the Holy
[52:45] Spirit comes and lays it out and puts it
[52:47] together like a puzzle so you don't have
[52:48] a cow up in the in the clouds or a cow
[52:51] up in the sky or something then this
[52:53] that's something that you can't do
[52:55] that's something that only God can do
[52:57] and that that's I believe a great
[53:00] mystery that you can't do it you cannot
[53:03] do it and many times we'll try to if I
[53:06] can just if I can just have summon up
[53:08] enough Faith but if faith is just really
[53:11] just simple believe in God's word let
[53:13] God take over let God uh
[53:17] let God have his way
[53:20] now we kind of look I know this is a
[53:23] real maybe simple message but you know
[53:25] I've listened to a lot of brother
[53:27] Randall's messages that are I was
[53:29] listening to the trial the other night
[53:30] that's pretty simple you know you know
[53:33] there's deep things hidden in all I
[53:35] don't mean to say that but God is
[53:37] revealed in Simplicity God the little
[53:39] the little simple things uh open up how
[53:43] great and how great God's word is and
[53:45] how great he is now so we looked at the
[53:48] angel delivering a message
[53:51] to to the two Mary's in Salome
[53:55] and then they got in the presence but
[53:58] still they were afraid something's
[54:00] something's not right everything's not
[54:02] uh that's not the evidence that I'm
[54:06] looking for
[54:08] that he has risen because we needed
[54:11] evidence today I believe
[54:13] I believe if we could you know you could
[54:15] uh
[54:16] like we were just talking about he just
[54:18] just laying out words we could look at
[54:21] all all through these different books
[54:22] and all through the different writings
[54:24] that evidence show that that that that
[54:27] he really was there that he really did
[54:30] live but you know you can still say well
[54:32] I'm not quite sure you could you could
[54:35] actually take somebody to the to one of
[54:37] the tombs over there in Israel and say
[54:39] well this is the place well maybe
[54:40] there's still room for doubt how how are
[54:43] you 100 sure that this is the particular
[54:45] tumor this is the particular place where
[54:48] he was crucified but when you get to the
[54:50] real evidence that he has risen there's
[54:52] no room for doubt when God shows you now
[54:55] I want to look at something just kind of
[54:57] interesting
[54:58] as we go to Acts chapter one
[55:16] uh
[55:24] bless you
[55:30] I'm sorry let's see
[55:32] yeah Acts chapter one verses 21
[55:36] through 22
[55:42] because now in verse 4 we read that they
[55:45] were assembled together together and
[55:46] assembled together with Jesus and he he
[55:49] gave them the commanded into they should
[55:51] not depart from Jerusalem but wait for
[55:53] the promise of the Father which saith he
[55:55] have heard of me and they were given
[55:57] that commandment to wait
[55:59] to wait until the Holy Ghost came now
[56:02] not you know brother Brian will explain
[56:03] it not wait and pray but just wait
[56:05] just uh wait and trust in the Lord when
[56:10] you have done everything that you know
[56:12] to do
[56:13] when you have done his his way and not
[56:16] not try to do it yourself
[56:19] try to work up something but just
[56:22] waiting on it and so
[56:25] they were told you shall receive power
[56:27] after that the Holy Ghost has come upon
[56:29] you
[56:30] and they they went up to the upper room
[56:32] and they decided
[56:36] and and uh
[56:38] they decided that they needed it was
[56:40] time to replace judas's place in the
[56:43] church
[56:44] and now I want you to look at the
[56:46] requirements that they in the 12
[56:48] disciples I mean look I want you to look
[56:51] at the requirements that they kind of
[56:53] put forth is that we want somebody that
[56:56] was there when the message was preached
[56:58] we want somebody that was there when he
[57:01] when he uh Rose from the grave and we
[57:04] want somebody that was there when he
[57:06] ascended we want somebody that was there
[57:09] and that will be in them and this person
[57:11] the evidence that he has risen and I I I
[57:15] I thought that was when I when I was
[57:17] reading that the other day I just
[57:19] thought that was so interesting that
[57:21] they that was their requirement for
[57:24] somebody that would feel the shoes of
[57:26] Judas now there's a space that Judas
[57:29] left and we're going to find somebody
[57:32] that just has heard the Angel's message
[57:36] and let me say it like that right and
[57:38] has been in the presence of the Lord was
[57:42] there when the things happened was was
[57:45] around was uh was present and but you
[57:50] know where is the evidence in his life
[57:52] that he has risen I'm not saying nothing
[57:55] about brother Matthias I know that many
[57:58] many scholars have written about how he
[57:59] became a pastor and I I hadn't read it
[58:02] in a while so I'm a little bit Rusty but
[58:04] how he became a pastor at a certain
[58:06] church and and did different things now
[58:08] I believe that the man the brother was
[58:10] filled the Holy Ghost but I'm just
[58:13] trying to make a point now their
[58:15] requirements the Holy Ghost had not even
[58:17] been given yet the Holy Ghost had not
[58:20] Fallen
[58:21] and they were looking for somebody based
[58:24] on on these two the things that I've
[58:27] kind of covered somebody that's just
[58:29] heard that's picked up a message book
[58:31] and just said and not of their head and
[58:33] somebody that's kind of said in a
[58:35] message church and being in the presence
[58:37] of the Lord while the spirit fell and
[58:39] said I think that's a good thing I think
[58:41] that I would like to stay there because
[58:43] it's a good it's a good church that I
[58:46] enjoy the fellowship I enjoy being
[58:48] around those type of people and that is
[58:50] the most dangerous place to be that is
[58:53] the most dangerous place of all to be
[58:56] especially in this time as we come
[58:58] closer and closer to a time where the
[59:02] the you know the foolish virgins that
[59:04] you if you read that scripture they were
[59:05] the ones that said Lord Lord and and
[59:08] Jesus said it's not the ones that are
[59:10] just called lord lord it's not the ones
[59:12] that are just Anointed with the presence
[59:15] it's just not the ones that just feel
[59:17] the power of God and and even cast out
[59:19] devils and do money wonders in his name
[59:23] and then they'll come to him and say
[59:24] didn't we do all these things didn't we
[59:27] cast out devils and and all these other
[59:30] things but he'll say I depart from me I
[59:32] never knew you
[59:35] and so what we're looking for is the
[59:38] evidence
[59:39] that he is risen
[59:41] and we a lot of times we'll place our
[59:43] own requirements on on what what the the
[59:46] new birth is a new birth is is something
[59:49] that's secret to you is something that
[59:52] God has done for you and and uh
[59:58] you know that when the when the sun was
[1:00:01] rising and back in the before the and
[1:00:04] when when God was creating the world he
[1:00:07] the the sunlight Shone upon his creation
[1:00:10] and it began to move and move upon the
[1:00:13] things and you know the first day the
[1:00:16] light came forth the second day he set
[1:00:18] things an atmosphere of creation and
[1:00:19] then life began to Spring forth and I
[1:00:23] was kind of studying on that and I I I
[1:00:26] noticed that
[1:00:28] you know sunlight can beat upon dirt and
[1:00:31] and things and it won't it just lays
[1:00:33] there and gets hot but when sun when the
[1:00:35] sunlight beats upon something that's
[1:00:37] germatized it begins to grow and
[1:00:40] flourish and you know the the evidence
[1:00:43] of of the Risen Christ is you could you
[1:00:47] could kind of compare that with with
[1:00:49] back then as the sunlight Shone upon the
[1:00:52] Earth and the Earth was going through a
[1:00:55] process you can look at maybe the a
[1:00:57] little fish being spoken into existence
[1:00:59] and then a little squirrel running out
[1:01:01] on a limb but the ultimate goal was for
[1:01:05] God to be made manifest in flesh and
[1:01:07] when Adam and Eve walked out in the
[1:01:09] garden that was the the culmination of
[1:01:12] the whole process now here the
[1:01:14] culmination of the whole process is not
[1:01:15] just here in the word it's not just
[1:01:18] being in the presence but the
[1:01:20] culmination of the of the process is the
[1:01:22] life of God being inside of you now when
[1:01:25] that life when that when that Dynamics
[1:01:28] came down upon the word when that body
[1:01:30] lay in that grave and the Dynamics Came
[1:01:33] Upon it and quickened it the only thing
[1:01:35] that could happen was that it sprang to
[1:01:37] life now that's what happens with a
[1:01:39] Believer when the Dynamics come and
[1:01:40] quick in the word that you've heard it
[1:01:42] Springs it to life and you begin to line
[1:01:45] up perfectly with the word you begin to
[1:01:47] come closer and closer throughout your
[1:01:49] life as you grow and grow closer and
[1:01:52] closer until one day you know because
[1:01:55] brother Randall said we'll be prickly
[1:01:56] until the body change you're prickly
[1:01:58] prickly prickly until all of a sudden
[1:02:01] you're changed and you're not prickly
[1:02:04] anymore
[1:02:05] because when you changed he said I go to
[1:02:09] prepare a place for you that where I am
[1:02:11] there you may be also that you'll have a
[1:02:14] place you'll be just like him
[1:02:18] and you know the the way that Jesus
[1:02:21] comes he comes through the the through
[1:02:25] those three experiences like a thief in
[1:02:27] the night come he comes past the five
[1:02:30] outer sentences past the five inner
[1:02:32] senses and and he sneaks on in and it's
[1:02:35] it's so mysterious it almost that you
[1:02:38] know there's no experience there's no uh
[1:02:41] sensation you know the mystery of the
[1:02:43] new birth without Sensation that God
[1:02:46] could come and Quicken somebody and put
[1:02:48] himself inside of you and and uh without
[1:02:52] you know because a prickle up your spine
[1:02:55] and those different kind of things
[1:02:57] that's not the evidence well you might
[1:02:59] be sitting here tonight and and not feel
[1:03:01] anything but but the the the the spirit
[1:03:05] of the Lord being will Quicken and
[1:03:07] reveal his word to you now
[1:03:10] that same quickening power was there
[1:03:13] with Enoch when Enoch you know he had
[1:03:16] that testimony that he he uh stayed
[1:03:19] right with God's word and he built a
[1:03:21] monument in the in the over there in uh
[1:03:24] in the East Egypt where um a monument to
[1:03:29] his revelation
[1:03:30] and one day that quickening power
[1:03:33] quickened him so that he walked off the
[1:03:35] Earth and Elisha the same thing he that
[1:03:39] that the the anointing that was on
[1:03:42] Elisha was so strong on him I remember
[1:03:45] brother Brandon I'm talking about the
[1:03:47] shunamite woman and kind of uh
[1:03:49] explaining some of those things about
[1:03:51] how that the the anointing the power of
[1:03:54] God and that man was so great that when
[1:03:56] he came and laid himself on the shoot of
[1:03:58] my woman's boy he didn't he didn't pray
[1:04:00] he just the power of God he laid himself
[1:04:03] across that boy's body and he was raised
[1:04:05] up and when he died the power of God was
[1:04:09] still so strong in his bones that when
[1:04:12] someone died and fell in on top of his
[1:04:14] bones it was quickened and he came to he
[1:04:16] sprang to life again that quickening
[1:04:18] power carried to Philip after he
[1:04:20] expounded the word the Enoch to uh the
[1:04:24] Ethiopian eunuch and explain the word
[1:04:26] and it quickened him and carried him
[1:04:28] over to the a few miles away
[1:04:30] because the quickening power is the
[1:04:33] power of the Gospel the gospel that just
[1:04:35] in word only but the gospel is the power
[1:04:38] of uh the power of the Salvation of the
[1:04:41] word
[1:04:42] David now
[1:04:45] I want to at this time maybe just kind
[1:04:47] of prove what I'm saying with by going
[1:04:50] to some quotes because
[1:04:52] you know
[1:04:54] I can say many things but I believe it
[1:04:56] must be compared back to the Bible and
[1:04:58] the things that the prophet brought it's
[1:05:00] got to be compared back because you know
[1:05:03] Paul said if if you preach anything
[1:05:04] other than what I preached then even if
[1:05:07] you're an angel let him be accursed so
[1:05:10] um let's just kind of go through some of
[1:05:12] these some some of these things uh
[1:05:13] Brother Anderson let's pull up the first
[1:05:15] one it is the rising of the Sun
[1:05:19] and let's look for the evidence
[1:05:22] that he has risen
[1:05:24] and it is the rising of the Sun 1965.
[1:05:28] Satan doesn't care how religious you are
[1:05:30] or how right you are in your Doctrine if
[1:05:32] you miss that life you won't come up
[1:05:34] anyhow no matter how religious how good
[1:05:37] how many churches you belong to or will
[1:05:39] belong to it doesn't matter one thing
[1:05:41] unless you have been born again
[1:05:45] no matter how somebody else can explain
[1:05:48] the seals or all the different things if
[1:05:50] if that life isn't living in you and you
[1:05:53] have a personal revelation your own self
[1:05:55] then what good will all the all the the
[1:05:58] knowledge big stacks and reams of paper
[1:06:00] that explain all the different Mysteries
[1:06:02] all the different uh what good will that
[1:06:05] do because Satan is not scared of that
[1:06:07] he's scared of the life the life behind
[1:06:09] the name that's what cast out the Devils
[1:06:13] you know that little story of how Jesus
[1:06:16] came across the shore the Sea of Galilee
[1:06:18] to be there with the disciple he walked
[1:06:21] across the water why did he walk across
[1:06:23] the water because he was getting to that
[1:06:25] man of gadar or that insane man is what
[1:06:28] brother Brown said he was traveling all
[1:06:30] that way he was on his way to deliver
[1:06:34] that man of the devil and he delivered
[1:06:36] him by the power that was in him the
[1:06:38] power that he he told uh uh two of his
[1:06:42] disciples when their mom said what can I
[1:06:44] I forget which ones it was can I can
[1:06:46] they sit at your right hand one of your
[1:06:48] right hand once you're left are you able
[1:06:50] to be baptized with the baptism that I'm
[1:06:52] baptized with and one day they were
[1:06:54] baptized with that baptism and they that
[1:06:57] same power that was within him was in
[1:06:58] them now they could go forth through in
[1:07:01] the Greater Works because that's how the
[1:07:03] Greater Works are accomplished by that
[1:07:05] same life that same token life being
[1:07:07] present in them and we were coming over
[1:07:09] listening to brother the Brandon
[1:07:11] preached on the token and he said if you
[1:07:12] got the token now imagine this if you
[1:07:15] got the token like say a physical token
[1:07:18] like when I get on the train to go to
[1:07:19] work a physical token when you when I
[1:07:22] get on there and I swipe it or whatever
[1:07:23] I cannot be denied because I've got the
[1:07:26] proof I've got the token now when you've
[1:07:28] got that life that same life that was in
[1:07:30] him then how can God deny you not for
[1:07:34] foolish requests and things not not what
[1:07:36] I'm speaking of but when a real child of
[1:07:38] God comes and it comes and puts his
[1:07:41] request forth and holds that token up
[1:07:44] over your family over your children then
[1:07:46] God's got to honor that he's got to
[1:07:48] honor his life and brother Brandon
[1:07:51] explained it like like a light switch
[1:07:52] she said if when I go over and I expect
[1:07:55] when I flip the switch for the light
[1:07:57] switch to come on I I believe that the
[1:07:59] light switch will come on and if it
[1:08:00] doesn't come on then it's because
[1:08:02] somewhere the wires got crossed and if
[1:08:04] the wires are crossed in my life let me
[1:08:06] go back and examine my life and check
[1:08:08] things up and make sure that there's
[1:08:10] nothing in between me and my savior that
[1:08:12] everything's exactly laid out right that
[1:08:14] there's all the all the plumbing all the
[1:08:17] wire and everything's laid out just
[1:08:19] perfectly so that when I flip the switch
[1:08:21] the light comes on because that's what
[1:08:24] we we should have an expectation that
[1:08:26] God will hear and answer our prayers uh
[1:08:28] it shouldn't be remarkable when the
[1:08:31] other night last week I came home and
[1:08:33] and uh I got home from work and I walked
[1:08:36] in the door and my wife was she said I
[1:08:38] I'm so nauseated I feel sick and so I
[1:08:41] just grabbed her up in my arms and I
[1:08:43] prayed for her the Lord healed my wife
[1:08:44] and right then
[1:08:47] right then she said I don't feel
[1:08:49] nauseated anymore
[1:08:54] you know I say we shouldn't be surprised
[1:08:57] but I have to admit I was a little bit
[1:08:59] surprised
[1:09:04] sometimes you know when things happen
[1:09:06] that soon
[1:09:08] that's a miracle what God just comes on
[1:09:10] the scene like that and and you know
[1:09:13] sometimes it happens like that when you
[1:09:15] don't even realize that you have faith I
[1:09:18] was listening to a tape where brother
[1:09:20] random was preaching to a group of
[1:09:21] people and he said you don't need Faith
[1:09:23] you just need to know you just need
[1:09:26] knowledge to know how to wield it to
[1:09:28] know how to you know when you when the
[1:09:30] devil's cast out of and you three days
[1:09:32] later you start getting sick what's what
[1:09:33] you need a little understanding what's
[1:09:36] taking place you don't need more faith
[1:09:38] because faith is as simple as just
[1:09:40] taking God at his word
[1:09:42] in 1965 it is the rising of the Sun
[1:09:46] that's what I'm I'm speaking about it
[1:09:48] and that the rising of the Sun
[1:09:51] paragraph 70 and that Gospel Light
[1:09:55] of the Resurrection
[1:09:57] the confirmation of the word
[1:10:00] how did we know he was the Christ
[1:10:06] because he proved what he talked about
[1:10:10] it and that is the evidence that he has
[1:10:12] risen
[1:10:13] when that same life lives and you and
[1:10:15] proves that the things that were spoken
[1:10:17] about the types and the shadows and
[1:10:19] Moses and the pillar of fire and Philip
[1:10:21] being quickened by the power all these
[1:10:24] things that were spoken of in scripture
[1:10:26] now you are the Fulfillment of that type
[1:10:29] all these things that were spoken of
[1:10:31] before there aren't any more types after
[1:10:33] us this is it
[1:10:36] This is the End Amen How will I know the
[1:10:39] message of the hour God proves what he
[1:10:41] promised and he talks about it that is
[1:10:43] the identification that we are
[1:10:45] beneficiaries with him in the
[1:10:46] resurrection he proves what he has
[1:10:48] talked about what he promised to do in
[1:10:50] Christ he proved on the resurrection
[1:10:53] what he promised to do in the days of
[1:10:55] Moses he proved it what he promised in
[1:10:58] the days of Enoch he proved it in all
[1:11:00] the days of the Apostles he proved it
[1:11:02] now in this day he proves what he said
[1:11:05] because they are a part of that seed
[1:11:07] that was represented on the book of life
[1:11:08] that he came to redeem back to God again
[1:11:12] now there's a question for all of us
[1:11:15] there's a question for you is he risen
[1:11:19] and if he's risen then he's still the
[1:11:21] same today that he was 2 000 years ago
[1:11:24] when he rose from the dead because he's
[1:11:26] still risen the Bible doesn't say he was
[1:11:28] risen it says he is risen so do we
[1:11:32] believe that he's still proving what he
[1:11:34] said that he's still able to fill you
[1:11:36] with the Holy Ghost if you need it and
[1:11:38] let me just say this I think that's one
[1:11:41] of the things that I wanted to bring out
[1:11:43] when we were talking about that angel
[1:11:44] delivering his message that sometimes it
[1:11:47] almost seems like especially when I as I
[1:11:50] was growing up that that you know the
[1:11:52] devil can put in your mind that the Holy
[1:11:53] Ghost is like a popularity contest the
[1:11:55] baptism it only goes that it's something
[1:11:57] that is only a privileged group of
[1:12:00] people and you want to be part of that
[1:12:02] club but it's not it's not like that
[1:12:05] it's it's it's everybody if you don't
[1:12:08] have the the baptism it only goes
[1:12:10] tonight everybody in this building is on
[1:12:12] your team is on your side not to be not
[1:12:16] to be uh not to be part of a club but to
[1:12:19] be part of him to be part of Christ and
[1:12:22] it's not a popularity the thing about
[1:12:24] popularity if I can act a certain way
[1:12:26] then everybody will like me if I can if
[1:12:28] if I can do this or if I can if I can
[1:12:31] speak about the seals the way that
[1:12:33] somebody else does or or different
[1:12:35] things like that but it's it's about
[1:12:37] it's about the evidence of Christ
[1:12:41] Resurrection being in you and and having
[1:12:44] the power to do God giving you the power
[1:12:47] to overcome so if you have a problem in
[1:12:50] your life with with different things you
[1:12:53] know we this talk examples of cigarettes
[1:12:56] and alcohol and all these different
[1:12:57] things if the power of God is present in
[1:13:00] your life then it will deliver you of
[1:13:02] things that you cannot do by yourself
[1:13:05] he's more than able to deliver
[1:13:08] laughs
[1:13:09] and he's still the same yesterday today
[1:13:11] and forever
[1:13:13] let's go down to paragraph 192.
[1:13:17] now look Ben quickened you who were once
[1:13:20] dead and sinned and trespasses and
[1:13:22] darkness has he quickened what by his
[1:13:24] spirit that raised up Jesus on Easter
[1:13:26] morning from the dead and if it dwells
[1:13:28] in your mortal bodies now watch it also
[1:13:30] quickens brings to life and makes it
[1:13:33] subject to the word now how can you
[1:13:35] claim to have that spirit and throw
[1:13:37] yourself away from the word you're
[1:13:39] quickened by something else for it will
[1:13:42] Quicken your mortal bodies to the word
[1:13:44] you can't claim to be baptized with the
[1:13:47] Holy Ghost and then and then you know
[1:13:50] leave the word and say I you know I
[1:13:52] that's not true anymore that's that's
[1:13:55] not that's not correct and you know what
[1:13:58] else you can't do you can't correct the
[1:14:00] prophet you can't say I don't believe
[1:14:02] that the prophet knew what all what he
[1:14:03] was talking about because it's a
[1:14:05] trickle-down economy it's not a trickle
[1:14:07] up it trickles down from the angel of
[1:14:10] the Lord to the angel of the age to the
[1:14:12] angel of the church on down it is the
[1:14:16] rising of the sun paragraph 225 for no
[1:14:18] it quickened them to New Life
[1:14:22] it does the same thing for us now oh let
[1:14:25] me go back to that angel because you
[1:14:27] know a lot of people don't believe that
[1:14:28] they don't believe they'll believe that
[1:14:30] there's an angel of the Lord of course
[1:14:33] then you believe there's an angel of the
[1:14:36] church age
[1:14:37] but when you start talking about
[1:14:39] bringing it on down to an angel of the
[1:14:42] church do you mean I have to listen do
[1:14:43] you mean I have to go to church and
[1:14:45] listen to somebody else explaining the
[1:14:46] word to me you mean I can't just sit at
[1:14:48] home and and uh I just I'll just put in
[1:14:51] a tape and and we'll you know when you
[1:14:54] do that then you're getting off of the
[1:14:56] prescription because
[1:15:00] and that's Dangerous Ground especially
[1:15:03] after reading those quotes I just read
[1:15:05] and you you know you can well it is the
[1:15:10] rising of the Sun the quote I was just
[1:15:12] reading it it does the same thing for us
[1:15:14] now notice then they was so quick and in
[1:15:16] that quickening power the quickening
[1:15:18] power wasn't only in their soul but it
[1:15:20] was all over them
[1:15:21] not only the Dynamics come in to Quicken
[1:15:24] but it quickened the mechanics you see
[1:15:26] what I mean they were so quick until
[1:15:27] their tongues begin to speak in another
[1:15:29] language they were so quickened by the
[1:15:31] power of the resurrection of Christ
[1:15:32] until they lay their hands they were so
[1:15:34] quickened with quickening power to when
[1:15:36] they lay their hands upon the sick they
[1:15:39] got well it quickened your mortal body
[1:15:41] they were healed by laying on their hand
[1:15:44] but what about a quickening power that
[1:15:46] when you lay your hands upon your wife
[1:15:48] or your your children or or whoever that
[1:15:51] God that quickening power in you is
[1:15:54] transferred and can raise somebody up
[1:15:57] from from their condition
[1:15:59] the quickening power to take garments
[1:16:01] from the body of Paul and put them on
[1:16:03] someone and and and they'll be healed is
[1:16:06] that quickening power still the same
[1:16:08] today
[1:16:09] I believe it is
[1:16:12] paragraph 231 how can you say that that
[1:16:15] Spirit dwells in you
[1:16:17] though you've done everything that you
[1:16:19] thought was right
[1:16:20] here is your evidence whether you got it
[1:16:22] or not
[1:16:23] and this is the evidence that he has
[1:16:25] risen
[1:16:26] and you know when you get the evidence
[1:16:28] that he has risen
[1:16:29] many times people around you will not
[1:16:32] see that evidence that he has risen
[1:16:34] because it's not something you can just
[1:16:36] get from from Reading Theology and and
[1:16:39] uh but it's something where when you
[1:16:42] when Moses met the pillar of fire there
[1:16:45] wasn't nothing in the world could take
[1:16:46] that away from him he knew what he had
[1:16:49] saw what what he had experienced
[1:16:51] if the spirit that was in Christ is in
[1:16:54] you it also quickens you to the word
[1:16:57] amen for he is the word and if it
[1:17:00] contrary quickens you away from the word
[1:17:02] that it is of the spirit of Christ care
[1:17:04] what you've done until that moves you in
[1:17:06] the word my sheep hear my voice and they
[1:17:08] shall live by every word
[1:17:10] every word I was talking on that the
[1:17:11] other day
[1:17:13] let me
[1:17:24] okay let's skip down
[1:17:27] because I want to get on Matthias a
[1:17:29] little bit
[1:17:30] let's get down to the sign of this time
[1:17:32] 1963
[1:17:37] let's see what brother Brown I know many
[1:17:39] have read that what brother Reynolds
[1:17:41] said about how Paul
[1:17:43] was chosen over Matthias but let's just
[1:17:45] kind of read through this
[1:17:48] look even the apostles after they tried
[1:17:50] to choose one because of judah's falling
[1:17:51] they cast lots and it fell on Matthias
[1:17:53] that was the best they could do with the
[1:17:55] keys to the kingdom and there is not a
[1:17:57] scripture wrote where he did anything
[1:17:59] but God chose Saul and ill-temper little
[1:18:01] fella but he had to throw him on his
[1:18:03] back one day and let him look up a while
[1:18:04] and he said I'll show him what great
[1:18:06] things he has to suffer from me see the
[1:18:08] church chose Matthias but God chose Paul
[1:18:11] and remember Matthias was chosen before
[1:18:13] the baptism of the Holy Ghost fell I
[1:18:16] wonder if they would have made a
[1:18:17] different choice if they had just waited
[1:18:19] a few days
[1:18:20] see that's the difference God always
[1:18:22] does his choosing his election God does
[1:18:24] that by election by his foreknowledge uh
[1:18:27] the Paradox John the Baptist was another
[1:18:29] one
[1:18:30] you know
[1:18:34] we don't have very much record of where
[1:18:36] let's see man pick man like they picked
[1:18:38] Matthias and so to take judas's place we
[1:18:40] don't hear very much about him God chose
[1:18:42] Paul
[1:18:43] CC that was God's choosing and the
[1:18:46] church is choosing
[1:18:48] and then influences
[1:18:50] skip down to the highlighted part
[1:18:55] man tried to elect that office one time
[1:18:57] they cast lots for it poor Matthias
[1:18:59] never done nothing but God chose Paul
[1:19:01] and he did something because he was
[1:19:03] anointed and skipped down but when God
[1:19:06] comes in and takes over then we see the
[1:19:09] anointing of the Holy Spirit vindicate
[1:19:11] the word of God
[1:19:13] and then the next quote trying to do a
[1:19:15] god of service without it being God's
[1:19:16] will
[1:19:17] who would say there wasn't a holy
[1:19:19] brother and talking about the disciples
[1:19:21] that chose judas's replacement who say
[1:19:24] they wasn't holy but they cast lots and
[1:19:26] it fell on Matthias and when he what did
[1:19:28] he ever do nothing but Paul was the
[1:19:30] elected one that was God's choosing a
[1:19:32] little no sarcastic High tempered Jew
[1:19:34] not the Matthias the DD you know he was
[1:19:38] but Paul God chose Paul the church chose
[1:19:41] Matthias
[1:19:43] and Skip down all right no matter who we
[1:19:46] think is right God knows who's best
[1:19:48] qualified because he knows the heart of
[1:19:50] man he knows and that goes for anything
[1:19:54] in life that goes for choosing a wife
[1:19:56] choosing choosing a church you know when
[1:19:59] you choose a church a lot of times it
[1:20:01] might take years before you really get a
[1:20:03] full understanding of what's really
[1:20:05] being preached you know I find that to
[1:20:07] be true when I talk to different
[1:20:08] Brothers you can say one thing from
[1:20:10] behind the pulpit but when you really
[1:20:12] get to talk to somebody you find out you
[1:20:14] know they don't believe that
[1:20:16] that in the Old Testament they didn't
[1:20:18] have the Holy Ghost and all kinds of
[1:20:19] different things but you don't know
[1:20:21] what's really in the heart of someone
[1:20:22] but God does and God knows what's
[1:20:25] needful God knows what we all have need
[1:20:28] of now I wonder if we just stand for a
[1:20:30] word of prayer as I close
[1:20:35] because I believe that he has risen and
[1:20:38] I believe that the power of God is still
[1:20:40] here to take care of whatever needs we
[1:20:42] have in our hearts and our lives and
[1:20:45] maybe uh
[1:20:48] you know we all have different needs we
[1:20:50] all have different things that we're
[1:20:51] struggling with in life but God is still
[1:20:54] able God is still able to deliver and
[1:20:57] and uh
[1:20:59] he's still the same Jehovah Jireh that
[1:21:03] he always was
[1:21:04] now so if you believe let me ask you
[1:21:07] this question I I
[1:21:09] if you believe that he's still the same
[1:21:11] and you believe that he's risen just
[1:21:13] raise your hand up and let's show the
[1:21:15] Lord let's just make a little wave
[1:21:17] offering to the Lord we still believe
[1:21:19] he's still the same as we go to prayer
[1:21:21] let's all borrow his Lord Jesus we just
[1:21:24] thank you God for your grace and mercy
[1:21:26] to us tonight and I know Lord that this
[1:21:28] was a simple little message Lord but I
[1:21:30] pray God that as we go on our separate
[1:21:32] ways Lord it may be something said will
[1:21:34] just resonate within our hearts and Lord
[1:21:37] it won't be a message that was forgotten
[1:21:39] but that will remember this week tonight
[1:21:41] Lord God that he is still risen that
[1:21:44] almost 2 000 years later that you're
[1:21:47] still moving in your people that you're
[1:21:50] still walking among the candlesticks
[1:21:52] Lord You're Still revealing your people
[1:21:54] Lord and a secret coming in this day
[1:21:56] Lord Jesus making yourself manifest In
[1:21:59] the Flesh of your people Lord God and
[1:22:01] you're still able to minister to
[1:22:03] whatever needs we have need of because
[1:22:05] you care and we know you care of God
[1:22:07] because you set your heavenly the angels
[1:22:10] and your Earthly angels to seek after
[1:22:12] our needs Lord to minister and deliver
[1:22:15] the food Lord Jesus to put food before
[1:22:17] us that we can eat from your table of
[1:22:19] life to make sure we have what we need
[1:22:22] of to grow through this process to run
[1:22:25] this race well Lord Jesus they will
[1:22:27] finish it Lord God every hand that was
[1:22:29] raised tonight Lord I know that we all
[1:22:32] have secret desires and secret needs

[1:22:37] thoughts in heaven are louder than our
[1:22:39] voices on Earth you know Lord Jesus what
[1:22:41] we have need of you know the Lord that
