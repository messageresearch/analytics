========================================

had a good Christmas weekend yes and we're blessed you know I'm just filling in for the weight again and this morning I want to talk about just run through some quotes about that that might be helpful we'll see what the topic is in a second but listen let's read a few quotes first this this float in the Feast of Trumpets is talking about how the hourly we're living in Boca I'm saying that that clichy asked all the spirits uniting together and bring them all with one thing slaughter to blot out and you can see from this year in 2020 they're having this big alpha conference where all the Muslims and the Buddhists and everything are getting together things are moving together where the World Council of Churches has kind of forming up to you 9mm and you can see that the evil spirits are moving the devil's trying to attack things in the bride he tries to attack it come against things and save on evil we need to have a something just until we stand everything that the devil grows against us what kind of program is talking about here he says now you see what the Beast is don't you just a power comparison and empower ecclesiastical power jesus said in me so close like the real thing we just see they're very elected if it was possible but he promised to have something here for us in that day then we wouldn't be deceived and that's the word and Christ to make it manifest to us no we're just kidding it's getting so close down to that and here's the end where it's a holding down time and that's why you know people are falling waiting people are to see you seems like oh we honestly if you look at the things that people are saying around the message and doing and all that kind of stuff can be very disheartening almost but because it's the time when people are so infused people when they should believe even with church dates 103 more thrived in Toronto they don't know what's up and what's down it's a very deceiving time but God has given us the thing to come back the deception of Atari and giving us the word it would be so close is that within the message is that what it means well we'll see what is the message you got the three kinds of believers are this to hangers-on there's the true believer the make believer and the unbeliever so we were actually listening to the anointed ones on the way to church this morning and then that rug around talked about how the genuine oh the goats can be on someone's spirit but down the inside in their soul they can have they can be a false teacher so that makes them very very Christ they are an anointed one but it makes them a false Christ because they are a stake in their soul they're they're incorrect and so they're that's what's deceiving could they be teaching the truth and then follow away well right somewhere in there is good it's gonna be it's not gonna be bringing forth that the correct teaching of how to be born again the correct teaching and fourth of that falls under their age of how especially in this day that's what I'm gonna get to the message of the hour is more than just born again and so false teachers in this day will not be able to teach that so that's the way that you tell the true and the false in this hour is by the word by preparing the teaching that's coming forth with the teaching of that age to see if it's if it's correct so um we kind of that's really what I'm I want to talk this morning about what the message of the hour is that's what my topic is the message of the hour and what what what it because I feel like so many people are helping misunderstanding of what really the message of the hour is the message of the hour is not just do's and don'ts and you see so many and you come in and they get attracted to the signs and wonders and all those kind of things and as well around be able to discern things and the healing line and all of that and kind of get around kind of just the influence of the message but never really understand what the message of the hour is about and so let me let me read the nice quotes before I kind of go down that route so brother Brown said he was talking about in the Feast of the trumpets about how that that under the sixth seal or the sixth trumpet well the trumpets are under the C seal so under this under this when the sixth trumpet open it out of the bottomless pit came these 100 200 million demons that attack the Jews under Hitler Eichmann Solomon drove them to the promised land and he began to compare that and how the devil's come against the bride also and now in this hour the the Roman system had been held captive at the river Euphrates by preventing them from crossing over to the promises of God because they they were they were they stopped it they had all their traditions and things that bound them at that river and the same way the bride had been kind of seven church ages at by the dogmas and things that that that prevented them from taking the body change and all those kind of things but now here at the culmination things everything's been unleashed and you see these two systems coming against one another so he's saying that that church has bound the Holy Ghost for 2,000 years under mardian back there under the church agents has been bound not of the river of you free trainee but at the door of Crees and dogmas that the Holy Spirit can work in the church because of manmade systems but she is going to be liberated she's coming back that's what the Bible said so that's what the message of the aisle is for to liberate you to cook to come back to the truth that will set you free and we'll talk about that in a second and those two meet up together on the battlegrounds again Luther Lucifer and Michael again like in the beginning they've been bound for 2,000 years almost almost 2,000 years so if you're gonna fight in a battle you've got to have something you gotta be equipped to fight that battle and the equipment that God has given us in this age is the message of the hour which is this capstone message the capstone message to equip you to withstand on when the devil comes in and says well the message is false and all this comes to that then you've got the equipment to what stand against that because the devil knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for it she can do the greater works he will be in a miss long that's a quote we're all very familiar with if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian Church and by God's Spirit is earnest the Antichrist spirit Satan will be powerless before he will be as definitely 2a4 to the days when the crisis withstood is every effort to gain power over him in the desert revelation is what gives us power over the devil I feel like you know over the years people have kind of punted and probe to try to get an under to almost force an understanding of the two spirits within the framework of the church but it'll reveal itself in this time and as you grow in grace you begin to understand but just from talking to people what really is driving them and whether or not they're confused and all those kind of things so the message of the app is what I'm talking about because that will give us power over the devil power in this in this date and will liberate us and loose us and allow us to take a body change but look what I kind of want to start off talking about is if you need you need to have revelation - revelation is what will give you will give you the equipment - to combat the things that the devil throws at you in Matthew chapter 16 Jesus told Peter he said thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it no matter what the devil throws all the powers of the other of darkness are no matter what the devil throws at you if you've got a real revelation you're not gonna fall away no slide away you cannot and he said I'll give I don't be able to be the key to the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be loosed shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven now if gon get it Peter the keys and Peter preached the keys on the day of Pentecost then now you have the keys also and you have the keys which is the revelation of the word then that will loose you from being bound by the things of this world it will give you overcoming power who Matthew chapter 7 he said therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them I like it into a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain this enough I love you though real simple parables folks because Jesus is saying if you if you get your foundation strength if you build your house upon a rock and then rock is Christ the revelation of Jesus Christ when the winds come and blow against you and beat against you all that all the false doctrine all the different things that people say when if you if you've got a foundation and you're built up on the word the devil cannot swing you off of that rock no matter what comes you are you are convinced that the message that you've heard is true you convinced that Jesus is is your salvation when filled offered will spend enough on rock all right so each each a day each and a message and I think that's that's one thing that we you know maybe forget sometimes is that this age is not the only age that had a message to each each age had a message that call the people out of their denominational system to open up the door so that they could they could rise up higher and escape that the the false doctrine of deranged brother and said what should I do with Jesus called Christ he said he caused all physical death by trying to inject some heresy of segments of the word and that's the same thing that happened not see your own by taking don was instead of the words that's the same thing in the Methodist Baptist Presbyterian as the lights priest forth in each age and they turn it down that's the reason the Lutheran died when Wesley rose up it was in another age the word come forth and they had to accept it or die that's the reason that the Pentecostals are dying now because the age is here so whoever it every age they were at the end of the age a messenger would come on the scene to open the door and the one certain ones would receive that message and then if you reject it down you go you denominated which means which pretty much means you you rejected the message for your day and and from that can no more come any life that's that's where that big day big argument came can you be born again if you're in a denomination everybody wants to argue over that and see it you know you've got ones that there's there's lap overs and things because it's a like FF Bosworth was in the denominator I don't know if he ever saw that burger and was actually a prophet of God I believe he was born again and you got a lap over some things like that but as time goes on the light and the denomination the one as they reject the message the light begins to fade out until brother ever said and the seventh street change he said I left a little light because they look like it was so dark it was completely product out there was only light that was left was in the bride but in other words in the message be out so we're not we're not trying to be critical to point fingers I don't think you born again or whatever but eventually it will get so black that all throughout all the denominational system they'll form together in this world council of churches and it won't be any life left except for in the little bride so that's where the light is and all these messages is the message for each age call people out of that system that they were in as individuals not as a group but each individual had been received for their self and were called out to the message of their age as God brought the church higher and higher and higher by revelation and he said I and why are we not a denomination I believe that God has dealt in each age but did you ever notice they every time a church ever fails and as soon as they denominated a start failing or Idina and whenever they fail God never raises that church again and I mean it goes right straight to see if you want to know the history on that we can produce that that no church not ever in the history of churches has a denomination ever fail ever rose again Baptist Methodist Presbyterian Luther and whatever maybe when they fail they are gone God deals with individuals and not with the denomination and he keeps talking about that they see because as you're going up this is what is talking about the the porter the porter is the messenger for that age that preaches a message that opens the door for them to come out of that age to come out of the teaching of that age and program said that here's what happened if you know the original custom when a bridegroom's it gives out invitations for his away he just gives out so many of the patients and for every invitation he sent you had a porter standing at the door to put a robe on so they rode the people that car coming out coming through that door they rode them with the righteousness of Jesus Christ because they believed the message for that age so so let me ask you this question our believers in EJ is born again how are they how's it going in now really I mean really becomes confusing for a lot of people when you look at Luther and Wesley and then and then Pentecost because we get in our minds that well these people Paul will born again by justification sanctification the baptism the Holy Ghost the three stages but you can get in your mind well because Luther preached justification then he didn't see sanctification of the baptism the Holy Ghost Oh Micah teaching this morning is that everybody throughout all seven church ages came through those three stages from justification sanctification aback simogo in other words they heard the message for their age they believe to justification the unclean spirit went out and then God quicker the word that they heard for their age they had to go through everybody had to go through three stages whether it was Paul I read is Martin Luther Wesley the restoration of the gifts at Azusa Street and then eight the capstone message now you got to get those those numbers right because everything falls into this right pattern that's why brother Dale has been hammering on the soap for so many years that the messenger comes at the end of the age all arenas Martin Luther Wesley Azusa Street and then at the end of that a mezuzah Street of Pentecost the restoration of the gifts brother Branham preached his message which is what there's so much confusion about what was the message of the Alpha the message of the hour is not you must be mourning it this is the message of the hour the message of the hour is work for the round priest to give our body change to give it to give us faith to think a body change so everybody gets caught up in the clothes and the hair and the dress and all those kind of things which is something that that was restored it's part of the preaching of the message to try to understanding those kind of things but that is part of it that you must be born again but the message goes beyond you must be born again so down to the seven churches is what what got eaten damn was it because we looked at Luther and Wesleyan and the Baptist moment goes to presumes a strength and so we know that all of those people were born again by going through those that's three stages of justification sanctification the baptismal ghost they knew how to be born again so what got eaten down and what had to be restored the Joel it talks about the floors shall be full weed and the fashion overflow the 101 all and I will restore to you the years that the locust have eaten the cake the worm and the caterpillar and the paw worm my great army which I said among brother bring preached all of those sermons about about how the bribery will be restored the bribery is this tree and what was restored with now remember brother brown talk talk about that on the day of Pentecost that the word that the Apostles had heard for three and a half years was quickened and boom they shot up to brotherly kindness all the way to the top not the capstone because the capstone was rejected if they had received the capstone then they would have taken a body change so they got all of these virtues and they had all these virtues but down through the seven churches Roman dogma and all of those kind of things crypt in and that word that they heard the revelation of all these things was eaten down until he got just down to the to the roof but the room was still there the route was if you if they be eaten away in the route which they could not have done but then then how would the how would the life have come back but you know even in the yard if you if you cut a tree down if the groups still there you gotta watch it because it it's gonna spring back up exactly what happened in this situation and the Bible says in Joel I will restores and and and what brain is at restoration by is was the prompt this message to restores back to the original teaching that was lost down through the cemetery canes what was that original teacher well first of all that that that you need to grow up the stench of a perfect man now a lot of people are the baddest aware how a pro but the adoption that kind like that but they kind of probe at it but nobody can put it together like brother Branham did because he missed over two everything that was lost the true who Jesus living through the understanding of the Godhead true understanding of baptism all these kind of things to get us prepped to get us ready for his message which was preached to 1963 and and beyond I don't like contests on this between you know the fivefold ministry in every age preached the message that their messenger priests and every age there their mandate was to preach what their messenger preached so the true thoughtful ministry in this age will be preaching this right here and and I think sometimes some of the fivefold ministry not it's not the critique or nothing but the fivefold ministry is not called just to preach a watered-down message for another age that we just need to be born again or almost preaching like like a dr. Phil or dr. Dobson time message that we need to get our family straightened up and we need to you know if we didn't love one another in those kind of things which all that is needful and all that's good but the truth I hold ministry will be preaching the message that brother Branham preached which is all of this and all this I mean everything that was revealed in the seven seals everything after that who is this milk is attack across the mystery God revealed all of those kind of things that said that opens up the book of Revelation the book of Revelation is the bronze book and that book can never be understood in its entirety count to seven church ages until this message came you can open it up and I you know I don't believe you that and even met me in the early church thing Paul had no understanding of what the seven lampstands were the seven spirits before God the white robe judge coming down all of all of those kind of things and no understanding and they could just probe out it until until this doesn't in my brain said God said Luther with the word the Lutheran's spoke for God at that time but they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization tends toward dog many Creed's and not a simple word they can no longer speak for God then God sent Wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day the people who took his revelation from God became two living epistles read and known a man for all of all men for their generation when the myth of this failed God raised up others and so it has gone on for the years until in this last day there is in and other people in the land under their messengers will be who under their messenger will be the final voice to a final age because they're preaching the same thing now I'm just kind of going to skim through some of these things we know that Elijah will do two things turn the hearts of the children to their fathers reveal restore all these things and then reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders which is his message your message will forerun the second coming of Christ was what the man was told so you got I'm just gonna can skim through these these are all patterns that were for me aware that that the Elijah the John the Baptist was for running Christ which is the full revelation of God and just in this day the program was to forerun the second coming which is he's not coming in person but he's coming and bride to fulfill to bring the fullness of God manifest in us [Music] you don't get tired all right what we did we just got a few more minutes and then we'll take the year of Jubilee that brother brother Dale in different ones always always bring out is so important to understand what the message is it seems a little bit deep and you kind of you know when you start talking about numbers and everything I know people's eyes get a little droopy but it is the villainous 25/8 it says I'm just gonna talk about this and maybe close that shop number seven sabbaths of years under these seven times seven years and the space of the seven thousand subs year shall be under the forty and nine years that shot calls the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall you to make the trumpet sound throughout all your land in other words at the end of every seven years they have a little shimmy to where you could part a part of the thing that's going to go free just like at the end of every step every Church ages the trumpet would sound and the people in that age could go free but not completely another word you they couldn't go free with a body change and that's what this after 49 years the trumpet sounds that you can go completely free and other than the fiftieth year you have complete deliverance and that's why the year of Jubilee is so important to message believe understanding this understanding what the message is because when when the to revision done in the promised land which was maybe maybe you know around this timeframe I'm just an estimate they every forty nine years did you believe trumpet should have been bald maybe that I don't think they really did that and then they can go free so you can kind of see now if those in the the seventh month of the 49th year which is important for understanding how this pattern fits in together 7 & 8 which even on the day of Pentecost the eighth day was also the fiftieth that's why it's called Pentecost so the whole thing started out on each day on the day of Pentecost and because it was on Sunday the 8th day and on the 50 which was the fiftieth day after the resurrection well it all finishes up awesome after 49 years 7 times 7 7 times 7 is 49 weather around preached a message in the 49 to give us complete deliverance so that we could go into the 50 the benefits 25 begins with an eighth year got the perks God because of Jubilee ever 49th year the 50th year was the Jubilee we know that we understand that from the first two early of Leviticus 25 80 in 1977 will be the 70th Julian making exactly 3400 it going up the release so what is the year of release everybody can go free regardless of what you have done when you hear the message that brother preached and the 49th year it gives the release to not just your soul you know to the seven churches every every shemitah they had a release of their soul to believe the message for their age but a complete deliverance of your soul or spirit and your body regardless of what you're doing that's why brother I appreciation divorce if you can believe that my grace amazing divorce that God has given to you all of the things that you've done in your body will be covered over by the grace that God has given that's why it's so important to get a revelation of all these things in the capstone because the capstone message was a was a Jubilee message to give us faith there all that stuff that's homeless down thinking that we're not good enough and all that we're not but God has given us grace to take a body change full redemption of soul spirit and body because Hebrews 4:12 says that they did it lays out that there's three different parts of you piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart let me just kind of scan through some of this thing I'm not going to get through this Berkeley to go yeah let's uh I don't wanna get into this we're really get for you so listen let's just stop right there and then we'll go upstairs [Music]
