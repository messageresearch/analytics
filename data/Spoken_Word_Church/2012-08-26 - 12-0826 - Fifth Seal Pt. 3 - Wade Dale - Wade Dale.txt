TRANSCRIPT
========================================
started I'd say had to do everybody having a good week well he did a budget he did a budget he gave his money a name and a place to put it somewhere what he did he followed all that money to that debt and started paying it off so for those of you that's going through it now you can pay those things off yeah because that terrible R's done about the same how many how much money uh did y'all pay off before you even started the course by listening to the course over 60,000 so far R gab paid $60,000 off in how many years I and I wanted to bre and I want to give p on the back I went in I know where the eggs was I knew where the bread was I spent $9 first time in my life IJ and SP like d says about marketing they put everything right here at the door and they or they go to the counter and when you're standing at the county you look over here and you got potato chips and you got chewing gum and this is where they make their most money everything right up next to the reg where you got to stand there that's right hey I went to Walmart and I had all in my all there you go hey Don Donnie's experiencing some of this he told me yesterday he said it hurts when you pay cash hurt all right let's go Revelation 6 okay he's trying today's subject is going to be uh dumping dead at the in the class and and man if some of y'all older ones want to come this is this is good you can come you can come if you want to Revelation 6 verse nine when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy and true dust thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest for yet a little season until their fellow servants also and their Brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled all right now we know we're going to take the natural part today and just kind of go over the scripture show the natural part of what's going to happen then we'll get into the spiritual part a little bit later because the natural part has to happen so here you've got a group of people now the bride is gone right so this has nothing to do with the bride the bride's gone we provve that last the last several uh times that we've done this the Rapture takes place on the fourth seal as far as seeing the uh combat Beast go up and the combat Beast is what the Holy Ghost right so if the Holy Ghost leaves the Earth and you've got the Holy Ghost you're going with it all right it's the same spirit that raise up Jesus from the dead dwell in you which with the Holy Ghost he shall also Quicken your mortal body and take us in the Rapture all right by his spirit that dwells in you so we showed last Sunday the Rapture take place on the four seal and and showing on the chart or on the uh pyramid here too also if you want to look right here is where the Rapture takes place CU lay the see and church a in Rapture takes place and we're gone all right but we know know that that Capone has to come down and seal a group of people away according to the grace and we'll see the destruction of Nature and and somebody being given eternal life and didn't even want it all right and that's got to happen and blend in like I said here the fifth sixth and seventh seal has to come back around and be right here just for a moment brother Brown said just for a moment God is going to anoint a church when he anoints a church see he's going to anoint a a people excuse me but it's going to be a very small group of people all the other people that are dead and gone they don't they've never had this teaching all right so the Bible is never like Dad and I were talking about last night on Daniel 70 weeks just keep praying for us cuz we're we're you know getting uh a couple of weeks away from U from doing the the series on Daniel 70 weeks to a bunch of preachers which is going to be pretty tough but that's all right they asked us to do it so there's a lot of confusion in Daniel 7 weeks but the Bible tells you that it was sealed up to the end so nobody's going to understand it until the end time nobody's going to understand Daniel 7 we till end time cuz remember he told Daniel he said Daniel seal it up go to sleep with your people right right seal it up go to sleep with your people it'll be in other words it'll be made known at the time of the end or the end time which is now so people get probe at it and and these brothers can now say Well Clarence Lin did this and so and so did this and so on it wasn't open until that Prophet opened those seals and opened the Daniel 70 weeks it wasn't open to nobody zero right I don't care how Clarence Larin you get close to it I don't care and they they're great men brother rown said they were great Men You're A Smith and all them great men I'd say Born Again men or he wouldn't to listen to them Born Again men but they only had a partial understanding of what was going on their eyes were were narrow but now see when brother R come the book had to be open completely to allow us to understand this now us he did all that for us right so that we can be the ones that fulfill the prophecy Daniel go to sleep with your people because at the time of the end these things will be open and then in Revelations 10 you see the book is open the real book not to say all the books are false but the real book The Bible in Revelations 3:14 says the faithful and true witness not that all the other Witnesses were false but if you look up that word true it means last or the last truth that's coming to the end time the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God and that's where it start and begun in and that's why the people don't understand the Daniel 70 weeks which is has a lot to do with the seal all right if you don't understand Daniel 7 week you can't really understand what's going on here as far as naturally and as far as as spiritually cuz most of the people do not understand Daniel 7 you people in our church know more about Daniel 70 weeks than 99% of the preachers in this whole entire message there's only one or two preachers I've ever talked to brother claude's one of them brother no Johnson that knows what happened and that chart was right the quotes are right and can put it together that's only two people I know besides dad myself not bragging but my Lord Daddy's known this since 1974 this is old stuff D they're going to be really surprised when they see what goes on that weekend but it's got to be revealed you can't just teach it to somebody and they get it it's got to be revealed so pray that there's a revelation com amen not that we're trying to be something different or something important but it's just like I told you and it's like what in our in this financial peace course God's only going to give you what you can handle right and if you can handle he he sees you can handle more he'll give you more right a lot of people in the message can only handle a certain amount cuz they cut their your s off we cut oursel off from learning from God that's right right we limit the Holy Ghost we have the Holy Ghost to take us we have the Holy Ghost to change us change us and take us into Rapture but we are the ones because of enmity this division which is between your ears that will stop you from making the change of the body that's the only thing that'll stop you cuz you've got the Holy Ghost in inside of you that's Eternal but you as a human with your own ideas are going to stop God that's right and that's what you do you stop God yourself God don't stop that's right you stop that's right you stop God You Hinder God we're the biggest hindrance God ever had we are as our person but we have the Holy Ghost that's going to take us in a Rapture so in in the end time there had to be a Prophet come that broke the pure unadulterated word to us he couldn't be false he couldn't have this idea and it be contrary to this idea as they say in the Daniel 70 weeks you know the brother said we can't understand it because he made so many mistakes well if he made mistakes we need to find somebody that don't make mistakes and we know the Holy Ghost don't make mistakes right brother R might have said 700 instead of 7,000 that was a human error he might have said one thing and meant another but when you take the overall picture of what he said that's right that Daniel 7 leeks is a beautiful picture because you got to realize it is just exactly and Claude and I were talking the other day and it's exactly the truth you watched brother brand on the Daniel 7 weeks he said I don't know what that 70 weeks is he approached the Daniel 70 weeks just like he approached the seal I don't know what that second seal is I don't know what that third SE is he said that right well he didn't know what that 70 week he said I'm going to take this whole week and I'm going down and he said Daniel said he understood by books so brother Ryan went through the history the natural history of man and showed by books plus this book he showed by books that the time would be 70 weeks that's what he said what he said in the book but to take then and preach the seals afterwards we get this one point and and you say well this is not on on the on the line of what we're talking about yeah it is really because remember brother Brown said six seals finishes Redemption right the seventh brings him back to the Earth to get us the Gentiles the sixfold purpose the sixfold purpose does what finishes Israel's Redemption and brings Christ back to Earth with us in the Millennium six seals finishes our Redemption the seventh seal brings him back to pick us up in this church age then you got another week left right here God takes that same word and goes right down to a group of Jews those that sixfold purpose to make an end of sin reconciliation iniquity bring Everlasting righteousness seal up the vision and prophecy anoint the most holy and they one in there I always forget but what does that six sixfold purpose do in Daniel 9:24 finishes Israel's Redemption right and then the seventh seal brings him out of the future I mean out of the wedding supper right down into the millennium right same thing so you can type the seals and the D and 70 weeks that's why brother R said you got to get them right you don't get them right you got gaps in there bad gaps a lot of people got bad gaps biggest gap between their ear CU they take what some man says not what God Said all right so but what we got to see is too that that this is talking about Jews so the raptures taken place the Gentiles were gone so this has nothing to do with the Gentiles this is all the fifth seal right now to show here is of course we know the first seal to the Jews second seal to the all this is to the Jews naturally we get the spiritual application of it that's why I talked about 1 2 3 and 4 typing justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost and the word being made manifest all right same thing with here justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost the highest form of the Holy Ghost right and I think I'm going to go back and do that series again because I'm going to probably do it at brother r Spen next month when we go because you got the new birth is justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost puts you in the body right right some of you know this but we got a lot of new ones then justification and sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost seals you in and adopts you seals you in and brings you to the stage of adoption right okay this is your journey it's just seeing brother R said see he say see you've already come up this far and you don't have the holy spirit yet well everybody thinks you got to go up through here to get the Holy Ghost you don't know how to get virtue without having the Holy Ghost the right kind of virtue right so you got justification s Bap the Holy Ghost puts you in the body of Christ by what faith cuz really there's seven ads it's not it says add to your faith one 2 3 4 5 6 7 all right it's not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 or you leave him out that's right it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 but when you get up this far God's going to seal that in and make you come to a stage of adoption by not giving you another Holy Ghost but giving you refilling we need refilling every day right you get baptized here but many fillings on the way up because really this virtue is an act of the Holy Ghost knowledge is an act of the Holy Ghost cuz these are the characteristics of who Jesus Christ who was the Holy Ghost right so we don't receive another Holy Spirit or we don't wait till we get up here to receive another Holy Ghost no just brother R preached three works of Grace all the way even to the Future home even at the future home he says us the Jews and the world right all right justification sanation baptism Holy Ghost justification sanation baptism Holy Ghost justification sanctification in the in the message in the in the virtues the baptism of the Holy Ghost seals you in then you start right back over again because he's going to cap you with a headstone these people are the ones that's going to take the body chain that's where justification say baptism Holy Ghost now brother R came to the headstone but there's got to be an apex to where that there's a group of people not just one person right brother R couldn't take a Rapture by itself it had to be a group of people cuz it's Gentiles is is individuals but it is a group of us that's going in the Rapture right so we'll get into that maybe a little bit later but that's something to really think about because that parallels and shows you what we were talking about last Sunday you got seven Church ages that parallel the seal right right right R will take place on the four seal right right I I I just I feel for the one that had had a background but you're really going to have to just catch up I guess they're just really sometimes you just keep looping back and trying you know but you know what if you got the Holy Ghost God will bring it to it amen you got the Holy Ghost God will bring he'll Quicken it real fast remember those 11th Hour workers they got paid the same as the people that worked all day that's right they got paid the same amount why cuz they work just as hard right cuz God's not a respect of person the 11 to people made the same as the people work all day you say that may not be that doesn't seem fair well God's Eternal that's right now God's Eternal he he can bring you he can bring you through justification Sanic baptism the Holy Ghost and birth those virtues in you cuz that's what happened on the day of Pentecost on the day of Pentecost they weren't right here those 120 have been tutored by by by the virtue himself and they were right here at the faith of the fathers they had these virtues working in their life okay so on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell it Justified them Sanctified them during their walk remember they Justified Sanctified during the walk cuz even I was telling remember um Wednesday night I was preaching on justification then you go into sanctification even Judas was here but Judas never came to here if he did he'd be born again right but he was justified and Sanctified they were Justified and Sanctified the W well as soon as the Holy Ghost them on that Pentecost it sealed these virtues in them because they learned from the master himself they got the 3 and 1/2 year Ministry of Jesus Christ pureing unadulterated right that's why they could come to the faith of the father that's why we have to be restored back that's why Elijah had to restore us back to the faith of the father because Luther wasn't in this part up here Luther didn't have all these virtues working in his life okay he had the just shall live by faith even though he was in this church age this is just paralleled it wasn't that Luther had patience and this was his church age now these are just like I said these lines are just for reference all right these lines are for reference cuz really you start brotherly kindness when you have faith you're kinder to the brother or you should be when you start at Faith you have a little bit of virt you have a little bit of this and then it begins to grow you got all your fingers when you're a baby but an old baby you'll just grab stuff and throw stuff and drop stuff and but when you get older you know not to drop that hammer on your toe that's right but it's the same set of hands that you used when you were a baby so you're growing in Grace and knowledge and that's what's happening all the way up through here being all right do what being being born again that's exactly what it is being born again then you come to this part where God can adopt you I said can cuz you receive the spirit of adoption down here then you come up to here then you got this Capstone that's got to set down on top of you which is the headstone which is what came back that's what the 3 and 1/2 year Ministry of Jesus was plus that's what the 3 and 1/2 year Ministry of brother Ram was that's why this was the Apex of his ministry was the seal cuz that brought Christ back in his purest form purest form and then man didn't have to look at this these seals and say I wonder is that Jew or is that Gentile or is that cuz see the souls under the altar brother randam you'll see him say many times Souls under the altar crying how long he'll say that's the bride the the dead Saints which it is the dead Saints to a degree but when you put it in this scripture this is definitely not anybody that's born again all right everybody got that this is not because this says how long it didn't say the testimony of Jesus Christ it says for the testimony which they held which in other words they were staunch Jews they did the the the Saturday Sabbath they did the washing of the pots they did the sacrif rice of the Lamb they did all this they did all these things all the way down and even during ieman and Hitler brother R said that's when most of them were put into this group was when Ian and Hitler killed 6 million of them cuz just because they were Jews just because they were Jews all right they'll be given white robes now we're we get white robes down here they're going to be given white robes later on but it says right here I saw under the altar The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God they they were put in the word of God they didn't know the word of God they were put in the word of God cuz see they had the Old Testament that is which is the word of God they just didn't have a revelation of that Old Testament all right and for the testimony which they held not the testimony of Jesus Christ it was the testimony that they held all right and they cry with a loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy and true Dost thou not judge and avenge our blood now when you come to that brother Brand's going we're going to read some in the seal book probably next not next Sunday but a few Sundays from now and and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth now Christian people don't do that but see that was the attitude of the Jew that was in this Dimension that said hey they killed us for nothing they killed us just because we were Jews in other words Lord what are you going to do about it how long to avenge our blood all right and white robes were given in other words God said hey I'm going to give you eternal life because I I on purpose blinded you right so God could take a gentile bride I blinded you at Calvary so I could take a gentile bride but I'll not forget you I'm going to come over here and pick you up in 144,000 plus these people plus these people this is not the 144 p this is the people that were killed under Ian and Hitler that did not know that's why this is g r a CE because you're going to realize a group of people right here that are giv eternal life for just the testimony that they held which was they were Jews they were God's chosen people they don't know one thing about Jesus Christ they don't care one thing about Jesus Christ and you say that's pretty hard but they don't you go over there now and ask a Jew no he's not the Messiah he was just a good Prophet we don't care anything about him the Messiah is coming is that my brother said that what I don't know this but he said The Tender Mercies of God sure it's the tender hand of Jehovah down through all those ages but now when he made that quote it was back when the 68 million were killed in this Dark Age he said it was a tender hand of Jehovah being with those group of people and you can also apply that to this cuz it is the tender hand of Jehovah cuz he said I blinded you I did it right so I'm going to give you eternal life for your stand for that Old Testament gospel that's what he's doing but look that's why it's Grace that's why this is the greatest uh show of Grace because God gives somebody eternal life and didn't want it right he's given them white robes unto every one of them I'm reading scripture and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their Brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled so what are they waiting on they're waiting on 144,000 to be killed right in that last part of in the in the part the first part of 70 weeks or the last part of the Messiah week they're going to get a three and 1/2 year Ministry over there right fellow servants Jews but they're going to have the testimony of Jesus Christ because the two prophets are going to go but they're all going to be killed so 144 and two th000 are going to be killed they're going to be put in the same place cuz it says right here and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season in other words John's here in 2,000 years ago on patmas seeing this group of people God's telling them to rest a little while until their fellow servants also and their Brethren which were are Jews that's 144,000 that should be killed as they were they were killed for the testimony of being a Jew the 144,000 is going to be killed by their own people Ian and Hitler killed the Jews cuz they were Jews that was a gentile killing a Jew but in the end time it's going to be a Jew killing a Jew right 144,000 is going to be killed by the Jewish people cuz they're going to all be making sacrifices during that week that three and a half the first the last half of the of the Messiah week the prophets are going to prophesy 1260 days they're going to pull out 144,000 people that's going to be saved they're going to turn around and say hey we don't need to go into that Temple anymore Christ died for us remember they said showen said where'd you get those scars prince in the him the two prophets preached the same message they show the sign of the Messiah just like brother Brown showed the sign of messiah in the seventh Church they took us out of here he's going to show them the sign of Messiah through the two prophets 144,000 is going to believe him be saved and come out well then they're going to turn and say hey we don't need that Temple anymore you say how is that going to make now listen Jews are very weird people they're stomped right their belief is their belief is their belief right right we are still a bunch of dogs to them right so there's no way a Gentiles is going to tell Jew anything that's right all right so those Jews are going to come up and they're going to say we we have waited 2,000 years to get this all right and start making our Temple worship again and now you're telling us you 144,000 and2 prophets you're telling us now that we're wrong and you probably helped us you probably helped us get the things together but it's just like us going you go to a Baptist Church when y'all went to a Baptist Church same thing sat there b Baptist Faith was it nobody else was going it going to be the Baptist Methodist Pentecost whatever it was we're going nobody else is going but somebody came in and preached you a message and got you out well guess what they did in the Baptist Church they said well they left us they wern't of us so they left us and praise God they were right that's right we weren't of them but that's the same way the Jews are going to be and those St Jews that said hey why are you breaking down the very thing we tried to we spent 2,000 years trying to build this thing up now you're telling us it's worthless well they're going to turn around and kill the two prophets and the 144,000 they're going to physically kill them then they're going to become part of this group not exactly the same part okay not exactly they're not going to be lumped in the same cuz that fifth seal is just the Jews that did not want nothing to do with Jesus Christ but I believe the testimony of these others but they're going to be killed as they were should be fulfilled so when that's fulfilled whatever is going to happen in that period of time that they're dead they could talk to the people that are there or or I don't know what's going to happen but that fifth seal Jew does not care about God I mean does not care about Jesus they don't care about Jesus now they know God they know Jehovah but they don't care a thing about Jesus right so but God's going to give them eternal life because of their stand for what they believed in and he said I'll never forget Israel he said look up in the Stars count the stars look down at the sand he said same way you can't count the stars and can't count the sand I'll never forget it right don't though he divorced her though he put her away though he done all these things and took a gentile bride he's never going to forget Israel cuz there's going to be 144,000 that's going to be living with us in this new city right we're going to be living in the new city that's right they're going to be there as servants they're not wife anymore they they were divorced God married us but he's not going to forget cuz he's going to take 144,000 and put us all in the same place together they going to be servants in the Temple or in the new city and then these fifth sealed Jews let's don't discount them they're not going to be in the city they're going to be outside the city living outside Listen People there's going to be more people living outside the city than they are going to be living inside the city that's right there's going to be more people giving eternal life I think I read a quote the other night brother R said there's going to be more people giving eternal life than they are that's going to receive it here and be able to live in that 1500 m city cuz see they're going to fill the world the world that's 7 billion people in the world now and there still a lot of places that we ain't been cuz there's a lot of ice and and the climate but what if you turn this baby back up there's no ice there's no every all the climates the same you can live you can put 10 billion people on this world right so what are you worried about it might be 10 million people living inside the city but there's billions going to be living outside the city we're going to be able to go out and show them the gospel but we come back in the city cuz that's what we live they're going to be able to come into the city right take a leaf off of the tree to show the healing of the nation and the Bible says Kings so there must be something out there to where somebody is going to be a king somebody's going to be a prince see all this stuff you know we're not going to be just a bunch of people walking around a bunch of zombies walking around doing nothing there's a purpose to have eternal life there's a purpose for us to be here what about that fifth sealed Jew what about the guy that doesn't know anything about Jesus but God gives him eternal life for being good to you sit there for a million years and tell him how God saved your soul tell him how that man died for you cuz he didn't have a clue these fifth seal Jew don't have a clue what what what happened to God they just know he's Jehovah and there's a messiah coming well the 144,000 they're going to realize that they missed the Messiah they're going to accept him and they're going to go in a Rapture but these fifth seal Jews are going to be raised up somewhere and live outside that City but they're going to be the one they're going to be the ones that's going to show as a type though that fifth seal shows the greatest show of Grace because God give you eternal life when you didn't want it right there's your type God give you eternal life you weren't looking for God that's right you weren't asking God for eternal life well you said all yeah was no not at first you weren't that's right he called you and you answered once you answered you begun your journey toward receiving eternal life right all right that's why I said Wednesday night there's a lot of people that's going to be born again I think we ought to get people born again and not even mention the message cuz the message is not the birth right this is the birth out of this if you can prove Jesus Christ died for your sins out of this you got somebody hook but if you just start telling them about prophets and first one thing and another you're going to hear that little and they're going to think you're off in la la land somewhere that's right tell them about Jesus Christ right I didn't when I received the new birth I didn't receive it from William Brown I received it from Jesus Christ but then when I do receive eternal life that's why brother R said I I I don't believe we're getting them to Christ we're getting them to a book something written on a piece of paper no a birth that's why you see many people that some of you I'm going to tell you right now just before we leave I'm going to make you mad some of you I've sent you've come into the to the message after even I come in 98 never seen you in the altar crying for the Holy Ghost never seen it's a birth people it's not just coming to church and sitting down and going I believe the message the devil remember what I said Wednesday night don't talk to the devil about serpent seed he was the one that was there that's right he knows what happened that's right he knows there's only one God don't don't trick don't talk to the devil about stuff like that but we need birth in this church we need somebody get their life straightened up get a birth and then you know what it'll take you to this right here your birth will take you to the message of the hour it will not and cannot take you anywhere else cuz it's a birth of this word right here and of course this is this the Amplified version that's right know the Amplified version This Is The Love Letter this tell This Is The Love Letter but this is the BL between the lines this will tell you what's written between the lines that nobody's going to receive MH this book is absolutely sealed to anybody that's not born again amen it's sealed up you can't understand this book but when you're born again you understand what Jesus did for you amen you understand what the Holy Ghost did for you then you go back and say oh this is what it was talking about this is what it was saying to me love letter the between the lines that's right but I'm telling you and I if it makes you mad you're the one that I'm talking to I've not seen people in the altar seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost you just see people appear in church and they sit down then most of the time when that happens sooner or later you see them disappear but he didn't get a birth you got to go get a birth the birth is a mess a real mess it was a mess for me you're not going to get it no different that's right it was a mess for all those that are born again all right let's go Lord bless you bless that
