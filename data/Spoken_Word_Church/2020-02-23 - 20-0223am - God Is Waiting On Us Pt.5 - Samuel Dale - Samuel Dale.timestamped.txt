[26:39] your word and talk about you
[26:40] you just come on the scene in our hearts
[26:43] and our lives
[26:44] in jesus name amen
[26:48] okay hebrews we've been on this for a
[26:52] while we'll try to finish it today
[26:54] if possible now you notice how i said
[26:57] that
[26:58] that okay let's go to hebrews
[27:02] 11 39 we've been up in reading and
[27:06] showing how this
[27:07] is the children of israel this is the
[27:09] old testament saints and all
[27:11] coming down through through the 11th
[27:14] chapter
[27:15] and then we're getting down to the 39th
[27:17] just save time
[27:19] and these all having obtained a good
[27:21] report through faith
[27:23] received not the promise what all those
[27:26] old testament saints
[27:28] they had a good rapport everything's
[27:30] wonderful
[27:32] but the problem was that they didn't
[27:34] receive the promise of what
[27:35] the promise of the baptism of the holy
[27:37] ghost all right is everybody following
[27:40] me
[27:40] they did not receive the baptism of the
[27:43] holy ghost
[27:44] those old testament saints so that was
[27:46] the promise that was
[27:48] to be unto them but they never attained
[27:51] unto it
[27:52] god having provided some better thing
[27:55] for us that they without us
[27:59] should not be made perfect
[28:02] all right let's go over to
[28:07] romans we'll read it all we'll start
[28:10] about the 18th verse
[28:12] romans 8 for i reckon that the
[28:14] sufferings of this present
[28:16] time are not worthy to be compared with
[28:18] the glory which shall be revealed in
[28:20] us for the earnest expectation of the
[28:24] creature
[28:25] waited for the manifestation of the sons
[28:27] of god
[28:28] for the creature was made subject to
[28:31] vanity
[28:32] not willingly but by reason of him who
[28:35] hath subjected the same in hope
[28:37] in other words all creation everything
[28:40] is to this place doing what
[28:42] because the creature itself also shall
[28:44] be delivered from the bondage of
[28:46] corruption
[28:47] into the glorious liberty of the
[28:48] children of god for we know that the
[28:51] whole creation
[28:53] groaneth and travaileth in pain
[28:56] together until now and not only they
[29:00] but ourselves also which have the first
[29:03] fruits
[29:04] now watch what we of the spirit even we
[29:07] ourselves grown within ourselves
[29:10] waiting for the adoption to wit
[29:13] the redemption of our body you may be
[29:16] seated the lord had his blessing
[29:18] to the reading of the word
[29:23] now i want to i said if i can i want to
[29:27] try to finish this up
[29:29] on the uh
[29:32] point that we've been trying to bring
[29:34] out for quite a while
[29:36] that the whole creation we just read it
[29:40] the whole creation everything in the
[29:42] world is groaning
[29:44] painting to be delivered
[29:47] right animals trees
[29:51] people everything is groaning
[29:54] all right now and then we picked up the
[29:58] title part of it to where that we would
[30:00] uh be able to follow it and we'll read
[30:03] this in a second
[30:04] where that brother branham says even god
[30:07] is waiting on us
[30:11] see we think it's right opposite
[30:12] direction
[30:14] huh well that's all right that's fine
[30:17] it's all right
[30:18] but the main thing is to see that god is
[30:21] waiting
[30:24] god is waiting on you and i waiting on
[30:27] somebody
[30:28] why can't we believe that we're that
[30:30] person that's there
[30:32] all right why can't we accept the fact
[30:35] of who we are
[30:37] as i've always tried to illustrate to
[30:38] you the prophet said what is our biggest
[30:41] problem
[30:42] looking back looking forward
[30:46] failing to see what's taking place now
[30:50] all right now the statement i make is
[30:52] this point here
[30:53] and we'll back up into the message after
[30:55] a while and pick it up
[30:56] see we've we we accept the fact
[31:00] we gladly accept the fact that god sent
[31:03] a prophet
[31:04] in this last days to bring us the
[31:07] message
[31:07] right we happily rejoice
[31:11] over that fact of doing some of you
[31:14] actually were there
[31:15] enough to see you with your literal
[31:18] eyesight and see the things that took
[31:21] place
[31:22] in the ministry of this last day prophet
[31:26] all right so we don't have to worry
[31:28] about wondering well we don't know
[31:29] whether this is another
[31:31] no that's what i'm saying we make that
[31:33] statement
[31:35] and make that statement plain and blunt
[31:38] to you
[31:39] i believe that god sent us a prophet
[31:42] all right and we've been able to rejoice
[31:46] over those things you know that was
[31:48] brought by the prophet all right
[31:50] but that doesn't end at all
[31:54] me now i'm saying it and you get upset
[31:57] with me do what you want
[31:58] i'm not offended to nobody because i'm
[32:00] saying what i believe
[32:02] if the prophet's right he said we look
[32:04] back
[32:06] we look forward but we fail to see
[32:09] what's taking place now
[32:11] okay we look back some of you
[32:14] look back now and can talk and and have
[32:17] made your testimonies and
[32:19] and things about what you saw of the
[32:22] the the prophet being coming and
[32:25] bringing the message
[32:26] and you actually seeing the dead rays
[32:28] the sick healed and the thing
[32:30] all right and you're looking forward out
[32:33] there to
[32:35] many things to come forth because we do
[32:38] look forward to that
[32:40] but the prophet said our main point
[32:42] should be able to see what's going on
[32:45] now because what happened is wonderful
[32:49] what will take place is wonderful but
[32:51] what about now
[32:53] all right see that's my whole emphasis
[32:56] that i've driven to you
[32:57] for all of the years that i've been
[32:59] trying to pastor this church is one
[33:01] thing
[33:02] that i'm happy to be where i'm at
[33:07] i rejoice in where i'm at
[33:10] i don't have to worry about trying to
[33:12] find something else
[33:15] i believe it and i walk in it to what
[33:17] that we receive
[33:18] right now all right then that way the
[33:21] pres
[33:22] the bible comes to an open point because
[33:25] what does that let's see what
[33:26] i am means ever present for
[33:29] eternity the word i am so that's where
[33:33] we're at we're
[33:34] i am ever present for eternity
[33:37] right here talking now about god that's
[33:41] alive
[33:43] okay well i i i just don't believe that
[33:46] he's
[33:47] he's like well what do you believe when
[33:50] are you going to believe
[33:53] and what are you looking forward to
[33:56] to try to uh achieve
[33:59] whatever you decide in your life for
[34:02] what to be
[34:03] i'd like to know i mean i'm serious
[34:06] i'll give you the pulpit and let you let
[34:08] you explain it
[34:10] because i want to get out of here i mean
[34:14] there's one thing about it we're going
[34:16] to get out of here one way or the other
[34:19] now you know i mean i'll be 80 in april
[34:22] and a lot of you are and and there's a
[34:24] lot of us old enough to worry that
[34:26] you know we we need to realize we're
[34:28] going to do something like brother
[34:30] howard carroll said one time he said
[34:32] said i'm going one way or the other
[34:35] the age is going to get him you know or
[34:39] you know and just everything going to
[34:40] run out okay but now listen that's my
[34:42] whole point my whole thing
[34:45] is to try to to see what we're talking
[34:48] about
[34:49] that god is waiting on you and i
[34:56] to step forth and we'll follow it
[34:58] through in a minute
[34:59] to come to the position that we're
[35:01] supposed to come to
[35:05] and to walk off of this earth all right
[35:08] now that's
[35:09] that's as much as we can do okay all
[35:12] right
[35:12] but see now here's i don't want you to
[35:14] forget this
[35:18] see i believe
[35:22] that god is waiting on us to step forth
[35:25] and believe who we are
[35:27] and what we're here for i believe that
[35:31] uh you know i've always looked forward
[35:32] to that and i believe it
[35:34] i've always preached it i've always
[35:36] tried to believe it that you know
[35:38] that that it would come forth a day in a
[35:40] time
[35:41] that god would move on the scene i'm
[35:43] looking forward to that you say are you
[35:45] looking for a great revival
[35:47] no i'm in a great revival
[35:50] well he's been preaching on that part
[35:52] about the revival thing see i rejoice in
[35:54] the fact that
[35:55] that i've always talked about a revival
[35:59] as not because even in the baptist
[36:01] church we preached it come on church
[36:04] whether you preached it or what you did
[36:06] where was you at we preached in the
[36:08] baptist church that a revival was not
[36:10] for a sinner
[36:16] you don't revive a sinner
[36:21] revival is for a christian to be revived
[36:24] in what you're doing then sinners will
[36:27] come to the altar
[36:28] yes and rejoicing in their point to
[36:32] catch it
[36:33] but it's not that far the revival is
[36:35] supposed to be within you
[36:37] well i've been in a revival ever since
[36:39] i've been in this message
[36:40] i'm as serious as i can be about it and
[36:42] it's honest i wish you'd take my word
[36:44] for it
[36:45] i've i've rejoiced over this message
[36:48] ever since
[36:49] i saw the and started studying it
[36:54] and rejoicing about the things of god
[36:58] all right in doing that then see god
[37:01] is now and we'll cover this in a minute
[37:03] and just get back to the point
[37:04] but here's the main thing i've been
[37:06] driving okay listen
[37:08] is what
[37:12] why does it say
[37:15] that they without us cannot be made
[37:17] perfect
[37:19] and we know that means not to
[37:23] push policy up and make it it means to
[37:26] that we're not complete right
[37:30] we're not in our complete state
[37:33] all right now and what is it doing
[37:37] see i've emphasized over and over one
[37:40] thing
[37:41] to me
[37:44] the greatest thing could be thought of
[37:47] is
[37:49] the fact that you know that you're
[37:52] looking at christ and seeing him
[37:56] alive among us and walking in
[38:00] and you know and doing because that's
[38:02] the point
[38:03] all right that makes a pull
[38:07] what if we emphasized about that
[38:10] the reason or the point of saying they
[38:12] without us
[38:13] it's a pull
[38:16] there's a great pull among the endtime
[38:18] people
[38:20] all right see you may not look at it the
[38:21] way that i look at it
[38:23] i look at it as a pull to understand
[38:25] god's word
[38:27] you may look at it as a pull to have
[38:29] signs and wonders
[38:31] well that's okay because it'll be there
[38:35] don't don't tell me that god is going to
[38:37] come on the scene and open his word
[38:39] to the people and and let it be made
[38:42] known to the people
[38:43] and not be signs and wonders to follow
[38:46] i've never been that dumb maybe stupid
[38:50] but
[38:51] maybe not that far off because i've
[38:54] always looked forward to work
[38:56] that the prophet said after the door of
[38:58] the gentile i'll quote it back in the
[38:59] mean
[39:00] of the gentile churches close god will
[39:02] anoint a church
[39:03] then
[39:07] but what did he say
[39:10] he said he's doing it now
[39:16] right now among us
[39:20] right god
[39:23] moving among the people drawing what's
[39:28] going to bring the dead out of the
[39:29] ground
[39:34] not you're going to go dig holes and
[39:38] what's going to do there's a pool
[39:43] all born again believers are connected
[39:45] together
[39:48] you follow me all born again believers
[39:51] how that connection that
[39:52] that uh that part that anointing or
[39:55] whatever
[39:56] and we'll get back to it this afternoon
[39:58] the lord willing
[39:59] and uh because i want to make sure that
[40:02] i'm
[40:03] understood about what i'm trying to
[40:05] bring about this
[40:07] it's this end time about the anointing
[40:09] and the things
[40:10] that where we're at uh i'll try to make
[40:13] it
[40:13] clear as possible because i've i've been
[40:16] at it for 40 something years trying to
[40:18] preach it
[40:19] and seemingly some have misunderstood
[40:22] what i was saying
[40:24] in the things that i've said so i want
[40:26] to make sure you understand what i'm
[40:28] saying
[40:28] whether you believe it or not that ain't
[40:30] got nothing to do with me
[40:33] that's between you and god i just want
[40:36] you to make sure to understand what i'm
[40:38] talking about
[40:39] all right and to worry that i can can
[40:42] see it huh
[40:43] would you go get me some water
[40:46] um i've had a problem with a dry mouth
[40:49] now for a couple of two or three weeks
[40:52] and you've never seen me in a dry mouth
[40:54] but i i have to drink water okay so
[40:57] forgive me
[40:58] all right but now listen what does it
[41:01] mean
[41:01] thank you brother what does it mean
[41:04] that they without us
[41:09] cannot be made perfect
[41:12] okay it's not something that we do
[41:17] it's something that we are
[41:20] then all right
[41:24] when the when the methodist went forth
[41:27] with a revival
[41:28] or luther when luther went forth with a
[41:32] revival
[41:33] and bringing it forth it started a great
[41:36] move right
[41:37] among the people okay the revival was
[41:41] among the people
[41:42] not necessarily luther as much he was
[41:44] dire and part of it
[41:46] but the main thing was the revival that
[41:48] was within
[41:49] the people of that day that started a
[41:52] pull
[41:53] a connecting so then when wesley would
[41:56] come forth
[41:58] he could walk right out onto luther's
[42:00] message of the just shall live by faith
[42:03] and as he would walk out on it then and
[42:05] bring forth
[42:06] his message it would just start a pull
[42:10] a connecting and as i said each one of
[42:14] these to me
[42:15] each each one of these virtues is a
[42:17] connection to each other
[42:18] each one of these ages is a connection
[42:22] the people of that age is a connection
[42:24] it's a drawing power
[42:27] they without us cannot be brought to
[42:30] that position of fullness
[42:33] all right
[42:36] see the whole creation is waiting
[42:43] now the whole creation is waiting on you
[42:46] and i
[42:49] right let's just see what is what the
[42:52] prophet had to say
[42:54] we'll read a little bit of these anyway
[42:56] uh go ahead with number one
[43:03] what was the holy ghost given for
[43:06] look what he says now when we need it
[43:09] the spirit of god
[43:11] raises a standard what is it
[43:14] he's pouring in his spirit
[43:18] a standard right
[43:24] and those that are are resting out
[43:26] yonder in the grave
[43:28] are under the altar of god as the
[43:29] scripture says they're crying how long
[43:31] lord how long how much longer
[43:34] god's waiting on me and you
[43:43] the church is waiting on me and you
[43:48] now look what he said adoption time
[43:56] when god can pour into us his fullness
[44:00] his power his resurrection
[44:04] that when the church and christ become
[44:06] so close together till christ becomes
[44:08] visible among
[44:09] us and raises the dead and we go in the
[44:12] rapture
[44:13] how much more wonderful could a thought
[44:16] be
[44:17] than to think about what has just been
[44:19] said by a prophet to us
[44:24] but do you understand what he's talking
[44:25] it's waiting on me and you
[44:30] huh
[44:33] see waiting god's waiting on you
[44:38] on me and you the church is waiting on
[44:41] me and you
[44:42] adoption time when god can pour into
[44:46] us his fullness
[44:51] all right then are you not looking
[44:54] forward to something
[44:58] i mean is there anything wrong with me
[45:01] to be able to read
[45:03] what a prophet says is due to come and
[45:06] i should be able to rejoice and say
[45:09] i believe that
[45:13] i believe that thank god
[45:16] for that i'm looking forward to that
[45:19] i've always looked forward to a great
[45:21] move coming among the people of god
[45:23] yes but not the way most people think
[45:28] about
[45:29] the doings because they don't think of
[45:31] the revival as the word of god being
[45:33] unveiled
[45:34] and then the after effects
[45:39] the rejoicing comes in the after effect
[45:41] part of it
[45:45] right why shouldn't we be happy about
[45:49] what we see
[45:52] i mean if if it's something wrong i'm
[45:54] sorry i don't
[45:55] i don't uh uh try to uh
[46:02] to make anything other than to me to
[46:04] just read it and see what it says
[46:07] all right now if we read it
[46:12] it says when we need it the spirit of
[46:14] god raises the standard
[46:17] why well brother dale are you expecting
[46:20] god to move on to sin
[46:21] i sure am i've always expected him to
[46:24] move on the scene
[46:25] you know what but i've always seen him
[46:27] move on the scene
[46:29] haven't you i mean we've seen the dead
[46:33] rays we've seen this
[46:34] thick heal we've seen everything could
[46:36] be thought of in
[46:38] forms or ways of of a manifestation in
[46:40] this little bitty little
[46:42] building here we've had a lot of
[46:44] manifestations
[46:46] right well i don't know about that well
[46:49] then just go to sleep and forget it
[46:51] you know i'm not throwing no stones at
[46:53] nobody i'm just telling you
[46:55] we've seen it take place
[46:59] when you can holler to a man and he's
[47:01] laying there in his eyes it doesn't roll
[47:02] back in his head
[47:06] and you call his name and you see him
[47:10] just
[47:13] uh he just come right back
[47:17] well you say well i don't know whether
[47:20] he was dead or not
[47:22] and i'll holler for you
[47:26] and we'll see if it'll work so if you
[47:28] die get me word i'll holler for your
[47:31] name
[47:32] i'll call for you because i believe in
[47:33] it
[47:36] i believe the same god that walked the
[47:38] shores of galilee is here today
[47:41] all right does that do away with brother
[47:43] branham no
[47:44] that establishes him in the basis of
[47:47] what he come to bring the message to us
[47:51] it doesn't do away with anything it
[47:52] doesn't make this that or the other
[47:54] it makes it all to be one thing
[47:58] god is living among his people amen
[48:02] all right think about it number two
[48:06] message adoption
[48:11] he's talking about dispensation there
[48:13] was a dispensation of christ there's a
[48:15] dispensation of the church organization
[48:17] there's a dispensation of the outpouring
[48:19] of the holy ghost
[48:20] now is the dispensation of adoption
[48:25] now listen what the world's
[48:30] waiting groaning
[48:34] and when the fullness of time comes when
[48:37] the dispensation of the fullness of time
[48:39] what is the fullness of time when the
[48:41] dead rises when the sickness
[48:43] ceases when all the earth ceases to grow
[48:47] the fullness of the dispensation of time
[48:54] a dispensation
[48:58] waiting on us go right to number three
[49:01] here you him
[49:04] running up where we get the there you go
[49:08] that's where god's trying to get his
[49:09] church just say to this mountain
[49:12] be moved and it will move
[49:16] now do we believe
[49:19] i mean a big man in this message i won't
[49:21] call his name but
[49:22] you know it enough he says that that
[49:24] spoken word was only for brother branham
[49:28] and the lord jesus
[49:32] well okay bring me your bible let me rip
[49:35] out that part where it says
[49:37] if you say to this mountain you know
[49:42] i mean what am i supposed to do with
[49:43] that just that one scripture what am i
[49:46] supposed to do with it
[49:50] i'm supposed to believe it all right
[49:54] and in believing it what authority
[49:57] sons of god the whole creation is
[49:59] groaning waiting for the manifestation
[50:02] which the word manifestation is making
[50:03] known of the sons of god
[50:06] waiting to a spot to where the sickness
[50:08] will be
[50:09] arise and it will be that way the blind
[50:12] will receive their sight
[50:14] what we need is adoption listen
[50:19] that's why i said it and i mean it
[50:23] i would have given my life hardly i mean
[50:26] almost the fact of seeing what some of
[50:29] you saw
[50:32] through the ministry of this last days
[50:36] why because i believe it
[50:40] i believe it when god spoke to me back
[50:43] there years ago
[50:44] coming out of the the denominations and
[50:46] said look like there'll be two prophets
[50:48] come
[50:49] well i believe it
[50:52] when he done a lot of things in my life
[50:54] i believe it
[50:56] i believe in a living god i believe in a
[51:00] god that's alive and well in our hearts
[51:02] and life
[51:03] when he's waiting on us to call him on
[51:05] the scene
[51:11] he's waiting on you and and i to to call
[51:14] him on the scene
[51:15] to where he can make manifest
[51:18] what he's promised that he'll do
[51:26] after the door of the gentile church is
[51:28] closed he said i'll know in a church
[51:30] then he said but he's doing it now
[51:33] all right to be
[51:36] rejoicing over what we see
[51:44] well i just don't know see that's the
[51:46] point
[51:47] that we die in our own
[51:50] ways go ahead number four
[51:58] we just die in our own sails huh
[52:01] go ahead and we're groaning waiting for
[52:04] that time of adoption
[52:06] and will we believe that one of these
[52:09] days the holy spirit will move in now
[52:11] watch
[52:12] not with a new birth for we've received
[52:15] that through
[52:16] christ but you'll adopt your church then
[52:20] i'm looking forward to these things i've
[52:23] always looked forward to it
[52:26] but the only way that i can look forward
[52:29] to it is look at it present tense
[52:35] see if i'm looking forward that means
[52:37] that somewhere away on our channel
[52:38] i'm pushing it beyond
[52:41] no i'm looking at what's taking place
[52:44] but i realize there's going to be more
[52:49] i've always looked for the church to
[52:50] come to a place and always preach it
[52:52] that way
[52:54] to where if we just believe god he'll
[52:56] move on the scene
[52:58] and do the great signs and wonders
[53:01] but if we don't believe him he won't do
[53:03] it
[53:08] do we believe it though do we believe
[53:11] the word do we
[53:12] do we accept one fact that he is alive
[53:19] waiting for the fullness of adoption
[53:24] all right there's no problem with
[53:26] waiting
[53:29] i don't have no problem with waiting do
[53:32] you
[53:34] i want to see god move more among us
[53:36] yeah but i can also wait for him to move
[53:42] why because he promised me he would
[53:46] and if he promised me he'd move then
[53:48] what i do i wait for him to move that's
[53:50] right
[53:51] but i don't wait like others do you know
[53:54] to
[53:54] well one of these days i i know but we
[53:57] we we we we we need to be more in tune
[54:01] with that back there now we need to be
[54:03] in tune with what's taking place right
[54:04] now
[54:06] what back there was back there what's
[54:07] out there is out there what's here now
[54:11] is what we need to be
[54:15] but i kept asking you the question
[54:19] why would it keep saying or why did it
[54:21] say there
[54:22] that they without us cannot be made
[54:24] perfect
[54:28] now that us must mean
[54:31] a group of people or you and i or
[54:33] whatever you want to call
[54:36] without us
[54:44] trying to come to a place to see
[54:48] what's among us then
[54:55] go ahead to number six i'm just trying
[54:58] to read a few of these things where
[55:00] at least you'll have it in your mind and
[55:02] i'll
[55:03] even put i'll read to you what i wrote
[55:05] on the side of my notes okay
[55:07] we have seen the same ministry
[55:10] of jesus christ in our day
[55:14] in the prophet
[55:17] amen okay i wrote that on my own notes
[55:20] where
[55:21] i wouldn't fail to remember we've seen
[55:25] i'm talking about you that saw it in the
[55:28] it was diary
[55:29] and and what we've seen
[55:33] in the prophet but does that stop it
[55:39] we're waiting for the fullness of
[55:41] adoption this will take place when
[55:45] this is number five at the first
[55:48] resurrection
[55:51] the fullness of adoption is going to
[55:52] come at the first
[55:54] in other words the first resurrection is
[55:56] the fullness of adoption
[56:01] it's not the fact of it trying to come
[56:04] it's here
[56:06] if we just believe it
[56:11] but why can't we believe it why can't we
[56:14] put our whole life
[56:16] see i don't have anything left over
[56:19] i don't have nothing in reserve i don't
[56:22] have any
[56:23] uh bank account and swiss stone bank in
[56:26] switzerland
[56:27] you know and all and i ain't trying to
[56:30] save up all of that
[56:34] i think it's sensible to be sensible
[56:36] with your life and your doings and your
[56:37] money i think that's sensible
[56:40] all right you don't have to be you know
[56:42] all out of it just just be sensible
[56:45] in other words ain't nothing wrong with
[56:48] having money in the bank
[56:51] right no problem
[56:55] but see don't put our whole life based
[56:57] upon that
[56:59] put our life based upon what god said
[57:04] right what god said i've seen these
[57:08] things i don't have to worry about it
[57:11] you know we were going to have a meeting
[57:13] had a dinner here one time and
[57:15] they all come in and told us what in the
[57:17] world are we going to do
[57:19] back then we didn't have something you
[57:20] could run up here and down here to get
[57:22] and
[57:22] to do with hardly you know and i said
[57:25] put it before the people
[57:28] there will be enough
[57:33] we set the table everybody ate
[57:36] it was enough we didn't have bushels
[57:40] left over
[57:42] didn't need it we just needed enough for
[57:45] that day
[57:46] we've seen these things church it's not
[57:48] something to
[57:49] to make that well i i feel if you know
[57:53] if i'd seen it in the prophet praise god
[57:58] the people were back there saw it
[58:04] well see you can't just put the whole
[58:07] thing based upon one point
[58:08] we put it based upon what his word says
[58:14] he said he'd take care of us are you
[58:17] worried about it
[58:18] i used to me and brother mo we kind of
[58:21] you know
[58:21] years ago we kind of got tied up in a
[58:23] little bit of our own sales i guess
[58:25] and at one time i had enough food
[58:28] sitting in the house
[58:29] my house had been able to fed this
[58:31] church for about six months
[58:35] sure did
[58:39] why because i was like everybody else
[58:42] and i still think you ought to have some
[58:44] beans and taters stored up
[58:46] i still ain't against that we still got
[58:49] some
[58:50] my wife she'll go to town she'll pick
[58:51] out two cans and sit
[58:53] in two cans you know and we cause why
[58:56] cause we may need it sometime okay
[58:58] ain't nothing wrong with storing up food
[59:06] but you see then it dawned on me one day
[59:08] hey if we need it god will take care of
[59:10] it
[59:11] he did a man gave terrence a big old pig
[59:20] so we were going to feed the pig
[59:23] so we took the food out of the house
[59:27] and we opened the cans and we poured it
[59:30] in and we fed
[59:31] that pig it got to where
[59:35] that it couldn't even stand up to eat
[59:40] i ain't telling you the poor old pig
[59:43] would
[59:43] wiggle up and get to the trough and then
[59:46] he'd just scoop it up
[59:51] sure was good to eat wouldn't it terra
[59:54] we had us a good time out of it
[59:57] but see listen church i still think you
[59:59] ought to have something
[1:00:01] i'm not saying to pile your house full
[1:00:04] of stuff
[1:00:05] but i'm saying it's good to have a
[1:00:07] couple of cans left over
[1:00:08] when the power goes off at our house you
[1:00:11] may not be on the end of the line like
[1:00:13] we are
[1:00:14] now the people on the internet wouldn't
[1:00:16] understand we're on the end of the line
[1:00:18] and when the power goes off we're the
[1:00:19] last one to get the power back on
[1:00:23] because we're out on the end we're in
[1:00:25] the country
[1:00:28] well i i think it's nice you ought to
[1:00:30] have something you want to put your few
[1:00:32] cans in this that or the other back
[1:00:33] somewhere
[1:00:35] and set it up and leave it well i ain't
[1:00:38] preparing for that
[1:00:39] don't be that way with me don't i've
[1:00:42] done told you i've been on both sides of
[1:00:44] the fence so don't worry about it
[1:00:46] you know i'm i'm going to depend on god
[1:00:49] i am too but if nothing happens i want
[1:00:53] something to eat after a while
[1:00:55] how about you i mean don't you tend
[1:00:58] sometime today to eat a little bit
[1:01:01] well why are you going to do that just
[1:01:03] wait for god to bring it to you
[1:01:06] just go sit down at the table and wait
[1:01:09] on him to bring it
[1:01:13] it's a good way to lose weight
[1:01:16] okay trying to be serious
[1:01:19] but not to be so bad but serious
[1:01:24] see why is it that they without us
[1:01:25] cannot be made perfect
[1:01:29] because in each age the word of god has
[1:01:33] always been the pulling power
[1:01:35] to bring that age to jesus christ
[1:01:40] to bring me and you to christ for what
[1:01:42] we have need of
[1:01:43] and he always promised he'd take care of
[1:01:45] that
[1:01:48] a pull between each church age a drawing
[1:01:52] power to draw us toward him
[1:01:55] till even as we've read from the prophet
[1:01:58] that he said
[1:01:58] god is waiting on you and i
[1:02:04] well no no no no we're waiting on god
[1:02:07] well see
[1:02:07] you're not listening god is waiting on
[1:02:11] you and me
[1:02:12] to believe his word he'll take care of
[1:02:14] the rest of it
[1:02:18] he'll take care of everything if we'll
[1:02:20] believe him
[1:02:25] right he had always promised it
[1:02:29] he's always kept his word to me we've
[1:02:31] never been hungry we've never had
[1:02:33] we always had something to eat how about
[1:02:36] you
[1:02:37] well somebody supplied it i'm going to
[1:02:39] believe it's god
[1:02:43] you say well now we got i can work for
[1:02:44] it well that's that's a good way to do
[1:02:46] that too because
[1:02:50] you uh you need to work
[1:02:54] i found out the bible said that
[1:02:57] it means ever read the bible you know
[1:03:00] the bible says if you don't work you
[1:03:01] don't eat
[1:03:04] well i didn't know the bible said that
[1:03:05] we'll try reading it sometime
[1:03:07] you might find out there's a lot of good
[1:03:09] things in there
[1:03:12] if we'll just read it and believe it but
[1:03:16] see what am i trying to get
[1:03:18] god is waiting on me and you
[1:03:24] all right see adoption
[1:03:27] time when he can pour in as we read
[1:03:31] his fullness into the church
[1:03:36] until it would make manifest god in a
[1:03:38] great way
[1:03:39] all right what would it be you realize
[1:03:43] that it's the same ministry
[1:03:46] can you believe it the same ministry
[1:03:50] is right here today
[1:03:53] that was on the shores of galilee now
[1:03:55] that's what your prophet said
[1:03:58] the same ministry
[1:04:03] all right then we don't have to try to
[1:04:04] pump up something
[1:04:06] we just believe it the same ministry
[1:04:10] that was back there with the children of
[1:04:13] israel
[1:04:15] it's right here today waiting on me and
[1:04:18] you to believe it
[1:04:23] accept it say thank you lord
[1:04:29] but i've never seen this what is the
[1:04:31] scripture and never seen the righteous
[1:04:32] forsaken or
[1:04:33] seed begging bread
[1:04:36] go over to number eight trying to
[1:04:40] read a few of these where you'll believe
[1:04:42] it so listen to what he's saying
[1:04:46] and the ministry of the pentecostal
[1:04:49] church
[1:04:50] will have to get so perfect till it'll
[1:04:53] fit right in
[1:04:55] with the same ministry that he had here
[1:05:01] okay let me read it which will take the
[1:05:04] whole thing in the rapture
[1:05:07] be in the church the ministry
[1:05:12] is going to fit together because that to
[1:05:15] me that's what i
[1:05:15] emphasize see to me that's the pulling
[1:05:18] power
[1:05:20] that's the drawing power
[1:05:23] of the church of trying to pull it to to
[1:05:26] the to the point of believing god
[1:05:29] the same ministry look at the next one
[1:05:32] number nine
[1:05:34] that's the church like the pyramid comes
[1:05:39] into a point so has the church in the
[1:05:41] days of luthier days of wesley days of
[1:05:44] pentecostal
[1:05:45] and now just before the headstone comes
[1:05:48] into it
[1:05:49] that church has to be honed so perfect
[1:05:54] and now what there's the point of why
[1:05:57] that they without us cannot be made
[1:05:59] perfect
[1:06:03] come on it has to be honed so perfectly
[1:06:07] to the same ministry he did hear
[1:06:10] his same spirit so predominant every
[1:06:14] banana will bring that same
[1:06:18] body right into it and resurrected the
[1:06:21] whole thing
[1:06:25] it's going to be what he's going to do
[1:06:27] right but he's going to do it through
[1:06:29] you and me right
[1:06:33] let's do let's get this slicer
[1:06:39] all right but the cap on the pyramid was
[1:06:41] never put on
[1:06:43] of into cairo and in egypt and the
[1:06:45] captain never did come
[1:06:47] because it was a cornerstone
[1:06:50] it was a headstone in the church it was
[1:06:53] the cornerstone
[1:06:54] in the full church it was the headstone
[1:06:58] is that hard to understand in the church
[1:07:00] it's the cornerstone
[1:07:01] because that's where it started we built
[1:07:03] on the foundational apostles prophet
[1:07:04] jesus christ being the chief cornerstone
[1:07:07] build on what they're saying all right
[1:07:09] that's the cornerstone but then you got
[1:07:10] to come to a headstone
[1:07:12] okay it was rejected
[1:07:17] and it will come and i believe that when
[1:07:20] it's coming
[1:07:21] that the church will shape into its
[1:07:23] place
[1:07:24] from justification under luther
[1:07:26] sanctification on the wesley
[1:07:28] and the pentecostal message will bring
[1:07:30] the church to such a
[1:07:32] a minority and a ministry will be among
[1:07:36] those people
[1:07:37] till it will be exactly the same
[1:07:39] ministry that jesus christ did
[1:07:41] that'll bring jesus and catch the whole
[1:07:44] thing
[1:07:45] away do we believe that
[1:07:50] the same ministry
[1:07:53] of the lord jesus christ
[1:07:58] is not coming it's here with us
[1:08:03] well i just can't see it open your eyes
[1:08:07] what's the matter is that you don't want
[1:08:11] to see
[1:08:15] would that be it could it be that we
[1:08:16] don't want to see
[1:08:19] what it would do away with anything for
[1:08:22] for god to come down and do great signs
[1:08:25] and wonders with you and i right now
[1:08:27] what would that do away with
[1:08:31] it'd be an honor to see him
[1:08:35] among us manifesting himself
[1:08:40] and i've declared to you over 40 years
[1:08:42] that
[1:08:44] at least you ought to listen to that
[1:08:46] point
[1:08:49] that i've declared that jesus christ is
[1:08:51] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:08:54] because i believe that
[1:08:59] then see to me then the point of what
[1:09:03] i've been driving at is the main thing
[1:09:05] the drawing power see
[1:09:10] here's your headstone here's your
[1:09:12] cornerstone which is over here but it's
[1:09:13] just
[1:09:14] faith it's drawing
[1:09:20] pulling us upward
[1:09:25] drawing us it's here among us
[1:09:31] see why would we doubt it being among us
[1:09:36] well i just don't see it well where's
[1:09:39] your eyes
[1:09:43] where are you at why is it you can't see
[1:09:46] it
[1:09:50] see if he's the same yesterday
[1:09:54] today and forever
[1:09:58] then all right when are we going to
[1:10:01] start believing now
[1:10:04] i mean literally believing it it doesn't
[1:10:06] matter what
[1:10:11] and let christ come among us to pull us
[1:10:14] together in a unity of love
[1:10:19] and i like i like what we're talking
[1:10:21] about kind of a sound mind
[1:10:26] but what about it do you believe he's
[1:10:29] the same
[1:10:33] there's no reason for us to doubt jesus
[1:10:36] christ being the same yesterday and
[1:10:38] forever
[1:10:42] that would make us unbelievers
[1:10:47] i believe that he's the same today as
[1:10:48] he's ever been i've seen him live that
[1:10:51] way
[1:10:51] i've seen him in manifestation i don't
[1:10:53] have to worry about it
[1:10:55] yeah brother dale i've never seen well
[1:10:56] then take somebody else's word for it
[1:10:59] until you can believe it for yourself
[1:11:02] how much more would that need to be said
[1:11:05] what's the problem you mean you don't
[1:11:08] believe
[1:11:09] him to be the same i believe he's the
[1:11:12] same in every way
[1:11:13] i'll quote wrote a random he said in
[1:11:15] every way except a human body
[1:11:17] that's one quote that he's the same in
[1:11:20] every way except for the human body
[1:11:26] why can't we believe that
[1:11:30] you see that's what i've tried to get
[1:11:32] you to see over this series part of it
[1:11:34] to
[1:11:35] to get you to understand
[1:11:38] they're waiting on us
[1:11:42] to step out and believe it who's waiting
[1:11:46] everybody everybody from here back
[1:11:49] is waiting
[1:11:53] right if not what are they waiting on
[1:11:57] they're waiting on me and you to step
[1:11:58] forth and believe what god had already
[1:12:00] said
[1:12:04] if you don't get nothing out of the
[1:12:05] message you get anything to understand
[1:12:07] get one thing
[1:12:12] that new birth that you have within you
[1:12:16] is jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:12:19] today and forever
[1:12:23] amen why would we want anything other
[1:12:26] than that
[1:12:27] or try to desire after it
[1:12:30] well if i could just see what is it how
[1:12:34] you believe to see or see the belief one
[1:12:36] of those will mess you up
[1:12:39] but listen church
[1:12:44] i've tried to get you to see
[1:12:48] that those people have died and went on
[1:12:52] they're waiting on me and you
[1:12:57] no they're waiting on god well where do
[1:12:59] you think god's going to be
[1:13:03] i thought you believed that god was in
[1:13:05] you
[1:13:07] i thought you believed the new birth put
[1:13:09] him into you
[1:13:10] christ in you the hope of glory
[1:13:15] this is each church do we actually
[1:13:17] believe god
[1:13:20] can we put everything we've got on it
[1:13:23] like i said i don't have nothing extra
[1:13:25] left over i just don't i don't have
[1:13:27] anything
[1:13:28] to worry that you know would be any
[1:13:30] different i'm just working on what i've
[1:13:32] got right now
[1:13:33] to be whatever god wants me to be
[1:13:39] come on musician listen
[1:13:45] get my whole point the bible says there
[1:13:49] in romans
[1:13:50] the whole creation
[1:13:53] is waiting
[1:13:58] the whole creation is waiting
[1:14:05] now we've talked about it that even god
[1:14:07] is waiting
[1:14:11] and i don't think that offends him when
[1:14:14] he was the one that told the prophet to
[1:14:15] say it
[1:14:17] do you i think he meant it
[1:14:23] everything's waiting on you and me
[1:14:27] to believe it
[1:14:30] and just stand on it if you don't get
[1:14:33] nothing from the series parts of what
[1:14:35] i'm talking about
[1:14:36] that they without us
[1:14:40] cannot be made perfect everything in the
[1:14:44] world is waiting on you and me
[1:14:47] adoption time when he can pour into us
[1:14:50] his fullness
[1:14:53] we can go in the rapture
[1:14:56] but see we look at adoption time like i
[1:14:59] tried to tell the people 40 years ago
[1:15:01] about adoption
[1:15:02] they were talking about adoption back
[1:15:04] then and they were saying well one of
[1:15:05] these days one of these days you know
[1:15:07] it's going to come one of these days
[1:15:09] we're going to have this out the other
[1:15:11] i said then as much as i've tried to say
[1:15:13] it now
[1:15:15] if you can't see christ alive in your
[1:15:17] life right now
[1:15:18] don't worry about tomorrow
[1:15:24] don't worry about tomorrow
[1:15:28] we need to be serious in our lives and
[1:15:30] our thoughts
[1:15:32] to believe god and believe what he's
[1:15:34] doing
[1:15:35] among us is what he said he would do
[1:15:44] how much how long would we need to stand
[1:15:47] here and talk about
[1:15:48] the things that god has done among us oh
[1:15:51] sister kathy's not here but she somebody
[1:15:55] stole her pocketbook
[1:15:57] we called for it and it came back
[1:16:00] brother cawley was up ministering years
[1:16:02] ago
[1:16:03] on a wednesday night i think for certain
[1:16:07] they broke into his home and stole his
[1:16:09] guns
[1:16:13] they come in the next day at work and
[1:16:14] told me about it and
[1:16:16] said brother colley got his gun stole i
[1:16:18] said
[1:16:19] we're going to call for him to come back
[1:16:23] we stood right there and all of us
[1:16:24] prayed together
[1:16:26] a few days later a man come up and said
[1:16:29] i'll tell you something to this degree
[1:16:32] i'll
[1:16:33] tell you where your gun is at if you
[1:16:35] just won't tell on me in other words
[1:16:38] what he was finally saying he wound up
[1:16:41] and got his guns back
[1:16:44] what else do you need we've seen the
[1:16:47] sick healed
[1:16:50] that a word
[1:16:55] well i need this well all right speak
[1:16:57] the word
[1:17:01] what do we need to be able to prove that
[1:17:03] god lives
[1:17:10] what is our reason for not believing
[1:17:12] that god lives
[1:17:19] he we've seen him do what he said he'd
[1:17:21] do
[1:17:27] what are we going to believe it
[1:17:31] men sitting right over here on this seat
[1:17:35] they were out fishing and he left his
[1:17:39] old boots on
[1:17:40] where he'd been working um
[1:17:43] concrete work
[1:17:46] and when the guy gets out in the boat
[1:17:51] the boat flips over
[1:17:55] brother doherty goes down
[1:18:00] they don't know how long that he was
[1:18:03] underwater
[1:18:04] because he doesn't know how long
[1:18:07] he said all he knew to do was he just
[1:18:09] raised his hands
[1:18:14] if you think about what i'm saying the
[1:18:15] boat turns over the guy has to get the
[1:18:17] boat turned back over has to get
[1:18:19] everything straightened back up
[1:18:20] get back into the boat and roll comes
[1:18:23] back to the spot that he thinks right
[1:18:24] where he's at
[1:18:25] and reaches down in the water
[1:18:29] and he gets him by the hand
[1:18:37] don't know how long he was in the water
[1:18:41] but god brought him forth
[1:18:46] what else do we need there's old danny
[1:18:48] sitting back there
[1:18:52] fell off a building

[1:19:03] i was there waiting for some what
[1:19:06] were joyce from two weeks
[1:19:10] two weeks that joyce and i were at the
[1:19:12] hospital until they even actually
[1:19:14] thought joyce was his mama
[1:19:16] and i was his daddy because when people
[1:19:19] come by looking for him they say well
[1:19:21] his mom and daddy took him down to
[1:19:23] the test to be run you know because
[1:19:26] we're there so much
[1:19:29] two weeks that danny lays up in the
[1:19:31] hospital
[1:19:32] comes out of it and he says you ought to
[1:19:35] know
[1:19:37] that i wasn't in my right mind
[1:19:41] well you see there he was in intensive
[1:19:43] care
[1:19:44] laying up in the bed just talking like
[1:19:46] everything and they'd say danny you got
[1:19:48] this spleen messed up here or something
[1:19:51] you got this done you got that and said
[1:19:53] you need to get he said well just go
[1:19:54] ahead and work on it
[1:19:57] when he come out of that i got chewed
[1:19:59] out he said you ought to know
[1:20:01] i wouldn't have volunteered for stuff
[1:20:02] like that
[1:20:06] but what i mean is
[1:20:10] he lived went down to atlanta
[1:20:16] aneuism
[1:20:19] ask him to just stick your hand up
[1:20:22] danny you see that hanging up
[1:20:26] underneath that watch is a prayer cloth
[1:20:32] told a lady the other day we took some
[1:20:34] prayer claws down to
[1:20:36] some people at the chiropractor
[1:20:40] and and i thought she might think about
[1:20:41] it some way and i said i said hey look
[1:20:43] don't you worry about them
[1:20:45] laws you can't wash the anointing off of
[1:20:47] them she just looks at it
[1:20:49] i said don't worry about it just wash
[1:20:51] them whatever they don't make
[1:20:52] you ain't gonna wash it off and i said
[1:20:55] if you need to
[1:20:56] just whack one of them in hive because
[1:20:59] it don't have to be a whole size
