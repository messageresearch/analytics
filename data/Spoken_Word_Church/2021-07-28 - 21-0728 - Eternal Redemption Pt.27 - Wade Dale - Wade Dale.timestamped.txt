[11:12] the lord bless you if you would turn to
[11:13] hebrews 9.
[11:17] we'll continue with the plan of eternal
[11:19] redemption
[11:21] we will get to the two prophets today
[11:25] brother donnie for sure because i cut
[11:28] out a lot
[11:30] i hate deleting quotes i just i don't
[11:32] like doing that i like deleting quotes
[11:34] but i had to delete some to get
[11:35] to get to where we're going so hebrews9
[11:38] and and
[11:38] and really you know and when we look at
[11:40] this plan of redemption from here
[11:43] forward when we leave
[11:46] in revelations 4 1 when the bride leaves
[11:49] you know i want y'all to understand
[11:50] something
[11:51] and you know that but some of the new
[11:53] ones don't there's a difference between
[11:54] the bride and the church
[11:57] the bride is a chosen vessel the bride
[11:59] is his sons and daughters
[12:01] the church is a is the church nominal or
[12:04] you call a remnant if you wish they're
[12:07] the ones that come
[12:08] part the way in but don't come all the
[12:10] way in they're taught
[12:11] you know like you know you heard brother
[12:13] branham they're teaching on baptism of
[12:15] holy ghost justification sanctification
[12:16] and then the baptism of the holy ghost
[12:18] puts you in the body of christ a lot of
[12:21] people
[12:21] are just taught that they need to shake
[12:23] a hand uh
[12:25] try to turn over a new leaf and then
[12:27] they get told all these
[12:28] life things that they need to do you
[12:30] know it's kind of like a kind of like a
[12:33] a chicken soup for the soul you know
[12:35] that
[12:36] i don't think chicken soup got anything
[12:38] to do with the soul
[12:39] right that doesn't feed me i want
[12:41] something to feed my soul the word of
[12:42] god feeds my soul
[12:44] the correct word of god now you can have
[12:45] the word of god but the correct word of
[12:47] god is what feeds your soul
[12:49] so tonight as we look even in book of
[12:51] revelations
[12:52] we see that because of the mystery that
[12:55] we have that's
[12:56] unfolded to me and you in the end time
[12:59] we can understand and see the bride
[13:02] and we can see the church all right and
[13:05] you've got to separate
[13:06] them if you don't like brother brown
[13:07] said that one man said well brother
[13:08] brown said it looks like the bride's up
[13:09] in heaven the bride's on earth the
[13:11] bride's over here
[13:12] he said you just don't have the bride
[13:13] down right you got to have the bride
[13:14] down right
[13:16] because the bride remember is a secret
[13:18] catching away the bride is all
[13:20] has been in the lounge book of life
[13:21] before the foundation of the world never
[13:22] to be
[13:23] erased in any shape or form or fashion
[13:26] that genesis 1 26 ma'am
[13:29] amen then you have a foolish virgin that
[13:31] comes part of the way
[13:32] and then you have the ones of the cup of
[13:34] water in my name and all those different
[13:36] things and they're the ones that are
[13:37] left for the tribulation period and
[13:40] we'll get into that
[13:41] in just a minute so let's buy our heads
[13:43] before we get started i think we got
[13:45] everything covered
[13:47] sure enough pray for sister gwen brother
[13:49] joe they really
[13:50] for 13 years she she harbored you know i
[13:53] mean she stayed there with that with her
[13:54] mom and now
[13:55] her mom's gone so uh let's just keep him
[13:58] in prayers dear heavenly father we thank
[13:59] you for this day that you give us
[14:01] this night in the middle of the week
[14:02] that we can just rejuvenate ourselves a
[14:04] little bit from all the carers of the
[14:05] world
[14:06] and just for a little while sit back and
[14:08] lord talk about you
[14:09] father we pray there should be ones that
[14:11] are sick the ones that the the ones that
[14:13] came in the real serious one there
[14:15] brother yancey's or sister ladonna
[14:17] we pray that you would just go to her
[14:19] right now lord
[14:21] and take that away from her lord and
[14:23] maybe may she be off that ventilator
[14:26] and lord she'll give you another
[14:27] testimony as just said that she was a
[14:29] real
[14:30] faith based lady believer
[14:34] so lord i pray that you'd touch her lord
[14:36] she stood for you now please lord stand
[14:38] for her
[14:39] we pray that you should be your brother
[14:40] tom earnest and all the different ones
[14:41] lord
[14:42] brother jewel called yesterday he's out
[14:44] of the hospital so he's doing better
[14:46] but we pray that you just continue to
[14:48] bless him and be with him
[14:49] be with a little bride around the world
[14:51] lord be with the ones even in our
[14:52] congregation lord that are not here
[14:54] tonight
[14:54] we pray that you touch them father in
[14:56] their body and give them something
[14:57] spiritually lord
[14:59] as they go through their journey we ask
[15:01] these things in jesus name
[15:03] amen brother jewell is out of the
[15:06] hospital i meant to mention and he's
[15:07] he's going through some more speech
[15:09] therapy because his speech is a little
[15:10] bit slurred
[15:11] from the mini stroke that he had but
[15:12] they haven't they're working on his
[15:15] he got two valves that are leaking in
[15:17] his heart and there's blood in his heart
[15:18] so
[15:19] you have to just be careful with that
[15:21] and they're trying to do it put the
[15:22] pacemaker in so
[15:24] hebrews 9 11 but christ being coming
[15:26] high priests of good things to come by a
[15:28] greater
[15:28] and more perfect tabernacle not made
[15:30] with hands that is to say not of this
[15:32] building
[15:33] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[15:35] but by his own blood he entered in once
[15:37] into the holy place
[15:38] having obtained eternal redemption for
[15:41] us and that's what we've been on for
[15:42] 27 sermons here now amos 3 7
[15:47] surely the lord god will do nothing
[15:51] he's not going to do anything but what
[15:54] he reveals is to the
[15:55] to the prophets first because the
[15:57] prophet is the mouthpiece of god now we
[15:59] know there are false prophets
[16:01] but you've got to discern the right and
[16:04] the wrong
[16:05] amen the line hath roared who will not
[16:07] fear the lord god hath spoken who can
[16:10] but prophesy
[16:11] then revelations 11 3 and i will give
[16:14] power unto my two witnesses and they
[16:16] shall prophesy 1
[16:18] 203 score days that's 1260 days clothed
[16:22] in sackcloth you may be seated in the
[16:24] lord at his blessing
[16:25] to the reading of the word and because
[16:26] that 1260 days
[16:28] see that's where it took another prophet
[16:30] because man has wondered what in the
[16:32] world is 1260 days because it doesn't
[16:34] coincide
[16:35] with our 365 days of the year but
[16:38] but the prophet of god being a prophet
[16:41] god spoke to him and said
[16:42] that's a prophetic calendar before the
[16:44] flood before the answer to the luvian
[16:46] flood
[16:47] that the world was standing upright and
[16:49] there was 360 days it wobbles now so
[16:52] there's 365 in a fourth day
[16:55] but under regular time it was 360 days
[16:58] all right and remember that when we go
[17:00] into the millennium it's going to be 360
[17:02] days
[17:03] it's going to be a thousand years not
[17:04] like our calendar years all right
[17:07] so in hebrews 9 11 he obtained eternal
[17:10] redemption
[17:11] let's go to revelations 1 verse 20 just
[17:14] the background just a moment
[17:16] because there had to be seven stars and
[17:20] we know the seven stars are the angels
[17:23] of the church seven churches so there
[17:25] were seven angels
[17:26] or messengers from god we saw that last
[17:29] week
[17:30] which they saw us are the seven churches
[17:32] so there's seven stars seven
[17:34] angels that are going to be sent
[17:37] to a group of people to create
[17:40] i said create the body of christ because
[17:42] that's what he's doing you create they
[17:44] become a new creation so they created
[17:46] the body of christ
[17:47] out of denomination and out of all the
[17:49] different things there's a bride being
[17:51] called out in every age
[17:53] not being in an age but they're called
[17:55] out of the age because
[17:56] the age if you read in revelations we
[17:59] read it in revelations one you see
[18:02] there's good stuff and there's bad stuff
[18:05] to each one of these church ages there's
[18:07] good and bad good and bad good and bad
[18:09] but when you come to the last church age
[18:12] none of it's good
[18:13] it's all bad why because we've we have
[18:17] actually put god outside the door he's
[18:19] the only church ages where he's knocking
[18:21] is trying to get back in his own church
[18:24] get back in his own building that's why
[18:25] i said you got to know there's a bride
[18:27] because the bride didn't push him out
[18:30] the church pushed him out
[18:32] all right so he's knocking on the church
[18:33] door knock the bride door
[18:35] because the bride has always been inside
[18:38] with god in the holy of holies
[18:40] everybody got that amen so now
[18:43] we see that we needed a prophet to come
[18:47] matthew 17 verse 10 and his disciples
[18:50] asked him saying why then say the
[18:51] scribes that he lies must first come
[18:53] and jesus answered and said unto them he
[18:55] lies truly shall first come
[18:57] and what restore all things in other
[19:00] words like we were talking about the
[19:02] the court of the gospel of jesus christ
[19:04] was perfect it was eternal it was
[19:06] complete
[19:07] and then man got involved and started
[19:09] taking the scissors of their own ideas
[19:11] and started cutting this one out and
[19:13] cutting that one out and
[19:14] turning the page where it says acts 2 38
[19:17] and
[19:18] and not matthew 28 19 which is we know
[19:20] it's saying the exact same thing
[19:22] but man didn't know that man's ideas put
[19:26] him totally separate and
[19:27] what created denominations
[19:30] you look now you uh we saw dad's brother
[19:33] yesterday that was a methodist preacher
[19:35] and i was
[19:35] going to try to ask him what are they
[19:37] going to do when they they're going to
[19:38] have their vote here i think next year
[19:40] or the end of this year
[19:41] whether to allow homosexuals to be
[19:43] preachers and that they say it's going
[19:45] to actually create another methodist
[19:47] church
[19:49] you can't create another denomination
[19:51] they're good grief they've got enough of
[19:53] them already
[19:54] but what is it going to do their ideas
[19:56] are going to split them
[19:58] there'll be a new methodist church and
[20:00] there'll be an old methodist church
[20:02] the old methodist church is going to not
[20:03] let the homosexuals preaching the pulpit
[20:06] and the new ones the new thinkers are
[20:07] going to allow that to happen
[20:09] all right well we know nothing against
[20:13] those kind of people the bible condemns
[20:15] them i don't have to
[20:17] amen the bible condemns unclean living i
[20:20] don't have to do that
[20:21] all right i'll shake their hand and say
[20:23] god bless you but i'm not going to enter
[20:24] into their junk
[20:26] or let them be able to do anything like
[20:27] the methodist church wants to allow them
[20:29] into fellowship
[20:30] but what is it going to do so what's my
[20:32] point my point is
[20:34] somewhere down the line that happened in
[20:36] another denomination and another
[20:37] doctrine
[20:40] like dad's always said the baptist
[20:41] church was the baptist church and then
[20:43] they split because one
[20:44] said predestination was this and one
[20:46] said predestination was that just off of
[20:48] one little thing
[20:49] you've now got free will baptist and
[20:52] first baptist and third baptist and 10th
[20:54] baptist and
[20:55] you got all these progressive and then
[20:57] you got the ones that are contemporary
[20:58] and
[20:59] you see what i mean god can't be that
[21:00] confused folks so god had to send a
[21:03] prophet to bring it all back together
[21:06] and listen he didn't just bring him he
[21:08] bring he brought him here
[21:09] under vindication
[21:13] and like i said before whatever you want
[21:15] to think about his life
[21:18] god spoke to me through that man amen
[21:21] god spoke to me
[21:22] through that man you're gonna have to
[21:24] decide where they spoke to you through
[21:25] that man
[21:26] amen and he helped me put the word
[21:29] together
[21:32] and he's waiting on us to fulfill what
[21:36] he's already said
[21:38] because you know what sometimes we might
[21:39] have loose ends
[21:43] because we don't have the full
[21:44] revelation yet but
[21:46] when he opened when those seals became
[21:48] open then he said the bible became a
[21:50] brand new book
[21:51] not a book became a brand new book the
[21:53] bible became a brand new book
[21:55] why he said now i call you bride he
[21:57] could take the bride and put them over
[21:59] here on this side
[22:00] and you can run it right down the
[22:01] scriptures and you're not confused
[22:03] you know who goes in the rapture you
[22:04] know who don't go in the rapture
[22:06] the bride goes in the rapture in the
[22:08] first resurrection
[22:11] everybody else stays dead for a thousand
[22:13] years
[22:14] foolish virgin people that are justified
[22:17] and sanctified
[22:18] but not the holy ghost filled people
[22:20] they go in the rapture that is the bride
[22:22] of jesus christ
[22:24] not to do with 144 000
[22:28] we're gone when the 144 thousand are
[22:30] called
[22:31] the reason they're not getting the
[22:33] baptism of the holy ghost is because me
[22:34] and you are still here
[22:39] amen we're holding off
[22:42] two things the resurrection
[22:45] and god going to the jews everybody's
[22:48] want god going to the jews god going to
[22:49] jews what's he going to do
[22:52] we better get what we going to do first
[22:55] what we're going to do to get out of
[22:56] here because we got to get out of the
[22:58] way because
[22:59] he's still got his hand over their eyes
[23:02] because of me and you
[23:05] so it doesn't matter listen and and i
[23:07] don't berate people but
[23:09] you read these people send me emails and
[23:11] they're in the message and they're
[23:12] talking about israel go over to israel
[23:14] and we need to go
[23:16] why
[23:21] we got to take care of this gentile age
[23:23] first
[23:24] remember brother branham had that zeal
[23:27] oh my if i could go out there in the
[23:29] plains of
[23:30] of mamrie or wherever he said he was
[23:32] going to go and he said i'll show them
[23:33] the resurrection sign he said and
[23:34] they'll believe it
[23:36] and they would have but it would have
[23:37] broke all the scriptures in the bible
[23:39] because he was a gentile prophet not a
[23:41] jewish prophet
[23:42] but what it was it was a man feeling the
[23:45] pull of israel because god's not going
[23:47] to forget israel we're going to see here
[23:48] in just a minute
[23:50] that all this building up me and you
[23:54] is to get that daniel 70 weeks and put
[23:56] it back together
[23:58] because it separated because of me and
[24:00] you
[24:02] he was cut off but not for himself who
[24:04] was he cut off for
[24:05] gentiles the bride not the church
[24:09] the bride amen
[24:12] so now eli shall first come and restore
[24:16] all things
[24:18] we know that the prophet of god preached
[24:21] every how many years he preached 30
[24:22] something years and we have tapes from
[24:24] 47 to
[24:25] 65 we look and we see the lies truly
[24:29] shall first come and restore all things
[24:30] and we know that he did that
[24:32] so let's go to malachi 4 read it again
[24:34] behold i will send you
[24:36] so in other words god's got to send you
[24:38] elijah the prophet he's got to send you
[24:39] somebody
[24:40] to turn your heart back you have to
[24:43] decide whether it's william branham
[24:45] john so-and-so or john doe or who our
[24:48] sister so-and-so
[24:50] right because god's going to put all
[24:53] these things in your way
[24:55] to see what you'll do about it all right
[24:58] and he shall turn the heart of the
[24:59] fathers to the children we know that was
[25:02] john the baptist because the old
[25:03] pentecost i mean the old
[25:05] testament fathers to the new testament
[25:08] age or children
[25:09] and the heart of the children the
[25:12] pentecost in 1906
[25:15] to the faith of the fathers because
[25:16] remember
[25:18] the prophet of god had to come just like
[25:20] elias and restore all things so he had
[25:22] to restore worship
[25:23] you see that he was answering questions
[25:26] i've been trying to go back to the con
[25:28] ordering doctrine series the two read
[25:30] books
[25:31] go back through them every once in a
[25:32] while it'll give you what
[25:34] church order it'll put everything right
[25:36] in the word you need to be there'll be
[25:38] no questions he puts it in the bible
[25:41] and he brings us a clarity on how to run
[25:43] the church because the church just got
[25:45] run by this one and got run by that one
[25:47] and
[25:47] brother dale them went to a church a
[25:49] long time ago where you just sit there
[25:52] you know there's no preachers that's
[25:55] right you visited too
[25:56] they just sit there until the unction
[25:58] strikes somebody
[26:00] and they get up and start preaching then
[26:02] this one sits down and
[26:04] another unction and somebody else jumps
[26:07] up and starts preaching
[26:08] well that ain't the way it is what a
[26:10] bunch of confusion
[26:12] but it's a church it's a denomination i
[26:15] don't know what they call herself but
[26:17] they were there and saw it and we know
[26:19] that the prophet of god said the spirit
[26:20] of the
[26:21] prophet subject to the prophet just like
[26:23] he said about
[26:24] speaking in tongues you can control that
[26:28] because you're not supposed to speak in
[26:29] tongues while the preacher is up here
[26:30] preaching
[26:31] doesn't matter listen it may come from
[26:33] god
[26:35] see that's the hard part it may come
[26:37] from god
[26:38] strike you but you've got to hold it
[26:40] until there's an order
[26:42] all right i don't know why i got into
[26:44] that but we all start speaking in
[26:45] tongues
[26:46] we'll promise you they'll be in order
[26:48] we'll be number one we'll be shocked
[26:50] like you wouldn't believe
[26:52] i'm talking about me too
[26:55] but there's an order listen see it's
[26:56] already set for us though we don't have
[26:58] to wonder
[26:59] who's going what book we got to read
[27:02] do we need to read dobson or we need to
[27:04] read this or no we need to get the
[27:05] conduct order and doctrine book out
[27:07] if you believe the prophet coming the
[27:09] end time to restore all things and he
[27:10] was brother adam was the prophet
[27:13] then i put my faith on that
[27:18] i really don't put my faith on william
[27:19] branham i put my faith on god sent
[27:22] william branham talk to me
[27:25] see and once you do that it smooths
[27:27] everything out
[27:28] you put everybody in their place and
[27:30] everybody's got their position
[27:32] you don't elevate him above anybody we
[27:34] don't elevate him above jesus christ and
[27:35] we know that
[27:38] but he was the messenger to bring us
[27:41] what god's already said
[27:43] there is not another one whatever's
[27:45] going to happen from this day forward is
[27:48] going to happen to the jews when it
[27:49] comes to prophets
[27:51] to make the two prophets that are going
[27:52] to israel which we'll try to get to
[27:55] tonight donny all right so let's re
[27:58] all right so if he's going to turn the
[27:59] hearts of the children to the fathers
[28:01] lest i come and smite the earth with a
[28:02] curse so god's made you a promise
[28:05] he's going to put someone in front of
[28:08] you
[28:11] that's going to take you away from that
[28:14] curse
[28:16] why when we go in the rapture that's
[28:18] when the curse falls
[28:19] the real curse this is not tribulation
[28:22] this is just a little bit of
[28:23] this is just nothing compared to what's
[28:25] going to happen when when we
[28:27] leave this place and there's not any
[28:29] control you say
[28:30] no we don't have control but you know
[28:31] what the world is controlled by the
[28:33] bride
[28:36] you mark my word everything that happens
[28:39] in the world
[28:40] is because somebody's coming to a place
[28:43] in the bride
[28:44] that god saw that they come to and then
[28:46] this is going to be here to combat it
[28:50] because remember satan's not original
[28:51] satan can't bring something first
[28:53] in the spiritual world satan cannot
[28:54] bring something first god has to bring
[28:56] it first
[28:58] god brings revelation god's god brings
[29:00] the word
[29:02] and then satan comes behind it and
[29:04] perverts it all right
[29:05] so if we'll keep that in order we'll
[29:07] understand that so now
[29:10] we know that that number let's read
[29:12] number one we've read this before
[29:15] that we look at malachi 4 and then we
[29:17] also read revelations 10 7 says in the
[29:19] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[29:21] when he shall begin to sound
[29:23] the mystery
[29:26] the mystery one mystery of god shall be
[29:28] finished you say brother is there just
[29:29] one mystery yes there's only one mystery
[29:33] to me it's a mystery of you
[29:38] that's the whole mystery the mysterious
[29:42] part that god is going to have a
[29:44] people a bride in the most violent age
[29:48] the most
[29:49] dark age the most confused age
[29:53] he's going to have a bride that he's
[29:55] going to not only
[29:57] take out of this world and nobody's
[29:59] going to know it
[30:01] they're going to take the whole church
[30:03] with them the whole bride's going to go
[30:04] with them
[30:06] there's got to be a resurrection coming
[30:08] this bride
[30:09] there's got to be a resurrection coming
[30:11] this hour that's why i'm
[30:12] i'm harping on that so much we can't
[30:15] have a rapture without a resurrection
[30:16] first
[30:18] and death has got to be destroyed to me
[30:21] that's the revelation that we're going
[30:23] to talk about
[30:24] here in just a minute because no other
[30:26] church age is required
[30:29] to beat death no other church age
[30:33] every church age going to go down to the
[30:35] ground another one's gonna come up gonna
[30:37] go down to the ground another one's
[30:38] gonna come up
[30:39] in the seventh church age there are no
[30:41] more church ages
[30:43] so my mandate and your mandate is to
[30:46] have
[30:46] a voice of the resurrection
[30:50] and we already got the resurrection
[30:52] signed by in a temporary form when
[30:54] brother branham stood and could tell
[30:56] people what they were doing last week
[30:58] next year whatever they'd done 10 years
[31:00] ago
[31:01] he could see it and be 100 accurate
[31:04] that's not a man that's
[31:05] god using a man amen
[31:09] never was wrong right
[31:13] so according to malachi 4 revelations 10
[31:16] 7 is going to do two things
[31:18] this messenger according to mount
[31:21] california turned the hearts of the
[31:22] children of the fathers
[31:24] he took the pentecostal babies that were
[31:26] standing in that meeting you saw him
[31:27] answering some of those
[31:28] or asking brother brown some of these
[31:30] questions they were asking him
[31:31] how to place this how to place that and
[31:33] bring them what
[31:34] back to the revelation that
[31:38] paul had irenaeus had and martin had
[31:41] because they had the true revelation in
[31:42] the first three church ages
[31:44] all right but then
[31:47] there's a mysterious r will reveal the
[31:50] mysteries
[31:52] of the seven thunders in revelations 10
[31:54] which are the revelations contained in
[31:55] the seventh seal
[31:57] and that's i know some are new and
[32:01] those words sound tough and hard but
[32:05] if i can understand it y'all can too
[32:07] okay
[32:08] i mean really if i can understand it
[32:10] y'all can all right
[32:11] because i'm about as hard as as the next
[32:14] guy he will reveal the mysteries of the
[32:16] seven thunders in revelations 10 which
[32:17] are the revelations contained in the
[32:19] seventh seal
[32:19] so there are seven seals in the bible
[32:22] everybody got that
[32:23] there's not it's not written where where
[32:25] brother brown had to write them again
[32:26] now they were already there
[32:28] the thunders are already there john was
[32:30] beginning to write them and god said
[32:32] don't write them
[32:33] seal them back up in other words i'm
[32:35] going to reveal them in the end time
[32:38] it's not timing john john was down here
[32:40] in the first church age
[32:42] there was a lot to do there was a lot of
[32:45] scripture to fulfill
[32:47] that john couldn't fulfill
[32:50] all right so now let's go to number two
[32:56] and i think we're going to get into this
[32:58] maybe when i finish this series
[33:00] i told you we're going to look at the
[33:01] characteristics of the son of man i
[33:02] believe we need to look at the
[33:03] characteristics of the son of man
[33:05] which we know it's a statue of perfect
[33:07] man but we want to see what jesus
[33:09] how he treated people how he treated the
[33:12] church
[33:14] how he treated the future bride
[33:17] remember there wasn't a bride on the
[33:18] earth at the time because he had his
[33:20] body
[33:21] his physical body was on earth that was
[33:23] the son of man that was his flesh body
[33:25] the body of god was standing on earth
[33:27] right and he can't have two bodies what
[33:29] he was he doing he was prophesying
[33:31] himself that there was gonna bride gonna
[33:33] come
[33:34] when he come back on the day of
[33:35] pentecost which he took his body up
[33:38] and then come back on the day of
[33:39] pentecost and went into 120 and made
[33:42] them little jesus this little
[33:43] bride running around on the earth
[33:47] so now look now he's been revealed to
[33:50] the church ages
[33:51] to the church ages as the son of god
[33:53] remember jesus said i'll come back
[33:57] i'll they're going to send the comforter
[34:00] in my father's name now wait a minute
[34:06] father's name father's not a name
[34:11] so what's the name of the father
[34:14] and who came back on the day of
[34:15] pentecost amen
[34:19] good you ought to be talking about in
[34:21] sunday school because what's the name of
[34:23] the father
[34:24] not jehovah that's a title
[34:28] he only had one name the lord jesus
[34:30] christ
[34:31] i and my father are three no i and my
[34:34] father are one
[34:37] and his name is jesus all heaven there's
[34:40] not another name
[34:41] so in other words you would think
[34:45] as a human that the father's name would
[34:48] be greater than the son's name
[34:50] right so the bible tells me though that
[34:54] all of heaven is named what jesus christ
[34:57] so there's not another name whereby men
[35:00] might be saved so there's not a
[35:02] coming up with a father's name that's
[35:04] different from jesus christ
[35:07] see that's what we it took a profit to
[35:09] bring us that
[35:10] and and then there's so much clarity
[35:12] though you can see it all in the
[35:13] scripture you can see it all in the word
[35:14] of god
[35:16] how that there's only one god and and
[35:18] and thank god that the
[35:20] the two witnesses don't have to deal
[35:21] with the trinity
[35:23] they're not going to be trinitarians
[35:26] they're going to go over there and you
[35:27] know what they're going to do
[35:28] they're going to start preaching and
[35:30] somebody's going to stand up and say
[35:32] hero israel your god is
[35:36] free no they're going to go to the
[35:40] first commandment hero israel thy
[35:44] lord is one and they're going to say
[35:47] finally y'all sent us all them
[35:50] trinitarians remember brother brown i
[35:52] met that jewish guy
[35:53] he said you can't cut god up in three
[35:56] pieces and send him to a jew
[35:58] the jews know listen when the messiah
[36:01] comes
[36:01] he's going to be god
[36:05] now did we know that
[36:13] we do now though we do now though
[36:17] so now he's going to be in the church
[36:18] ages through as the son of god now what
[36:20] is the son of god
[36:21] that's the holy ghost it can't be the
[36:24] son of man
[36:27] now watch the son of man god in human
[36:29] flesh god in his human flesh when he
[36:32] walked on the earth on the shores of
[36:33] galilee
[36:34] and all that matthew mark luke and john
[36:36] when he walked
[36:37] all the commentary that was god walking
[36:39] in human flesh
[36:41] on earth never called himself the son of
[36:45] god
[36:45] he said who do the man say i the son of
[36:47] man am.
[36:49] all right so he was trying to get him to
[36:50] see who the son of man was
[36:54] but he knew they couldn't stand not not
[36:57] stand but they
[36:58] you know it's like eating something you
[36:59] know you keep eating and keep eating and
[37:01] you get so full
[37:02] it may be the best meal in the world
[37:04] like
[37:05] i mean like cantaloupe and gravy
[37:09] man that's good oh and some tomato to go
[37:12] with it
[37:13] y'all ain't never lived until you had
[37:14] that but went but you know what i'm
[37:17] gonna eat so much of it
[37:19] and the church ages could only take so
[37:21] much so god give them a revelation of
[37:23] the son of god because peter said
[37:26] thou art the christ the son of the
[37:28] living god and jesus turned around and
[37:30] didn't rebuke him he said okay peter
[37:33] that's what i'll build my church on it's
[37:36] a revelation that i
[37:38] am coming back on the day of pentecost
[37:42] as the spirit of god
[37:45] the holy ghost and i am going to enter
[37:48] in a group of people
[37:50] and they're going to be sons and
[37:51] daughters of god
[37:53] that was their revelation and even god
[37:56] winked at their ignorance when they were
[37:58] become when they become trinitarians
[38:00] because luther was a trinitarian
[38:02] wesley was a trinitarian a lot of those
[38:05] great old ones were trinitarians but god
[38:07] winked at their ignorance because what
[38:09] uh i want to quote where brother
[38:10] reynolds tell and imagine divorce he
[38:12] says because of misinterpreted
[38:14] theology we see we've come to this place
[38:18] every what place you want to say i say
[38:21] anyplace that you're outside the will of
[38:22] god
[38:23] misinterpreted theology is what took you
[38:25] there
[38:26] right boyd said under methodist church
[38:29] misinterpreted theology
[38:31] made him believe that there was a
[38:34] trinity
[38:35] and he needed to be sprinkled instead of
[38:36] baptized and all these other things that
[38:38] all y'all went through
[38:39] were louise catholic right
[38:42] different ones you believe what somebody
[38:47] told you
[38:48] but you know what god winked at that
[38:50] because you were doing the best you
[38:52] could do under that condition
[38:54] but now under conditions that we are now
[38:56] we know better
[38:58] and you know what it makes it more clear
[39:00] it gives us more clarity to the word of
[39:02] god we don't have to go
[39:03] is it is it church on earth or there's a
[39:06] church in heaven there's somebody on
[39:07] earth what
[39:08] no we're going to see that in just a
[39:09] minute now it's been revealed to the
[39:11] church ages to the church ages the son
[39:13] of god god
[39:14] being a spirit the holy spirit he
[39:15] revealed himself in the church ages
[39:17] in the congregation as the holy spirit
[39:19] among the people
[39:21] now cut the rest of that off because
[39:24] that's what i want to speak on later on
[39:26] but not now
[39:27] about this son of man because
[39:30] we get the sign of the son of man which
[39:33] is luke 17
[39:34] 30. as it was in the days of noah as it
[39:37] was in the days of light
[39:39] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[39:41] of man
[39:42] which is god back in power and human
[39:44] flesh listen
[39:45] it's not to say that god wasn't in human
[39:48] flesh in those believers
[39:51] but it was a portion their portion they
[39:54] got their portion
[39:56] but when you and i come to this age and
[39:59] the mystery is supposed to be
[40:01] what mystery
[40:04] it's a mystery that you can interpret
[40:06] the word right
[40:08] you because you got to run it through
[40:11] your filter
[40:13] that's right you can't just listen we're
[40:15] not
[40:16] parakeets of william branham that's just
[40:19] saying what somebody else said
[40:22] and i know we quote him we quote him to
[40:24] give clarity
[40:27] because no one could say it listen if he
[40:28] was the prophet in the end time and he
[40:30] was the one who was going to speak to us
[40:31] let him speak he can say it better than
[40:35] i can
[40:36] because that's god talking to us amen
[40:41] and it should be god talking to you now
[40:44] all right let's go number three so we'll
[40:46] talk about the son of man a little bit
[40:47] later to give a little more clarity to
[40:48] that
[40:49] but see to me that's the mystery is that
[40:52] the son of man can be back on earth and
[40:54] you don't see jesus walking in human
[40:56] flesh
[40:58] that's the mystery it's me and you
[41:02] with the full revelation walking in
[41:06] human flesh
[41:07] because listen the son of man
[41:10] took a body change his body went from
[41:13] mortal to immortal
[41:16] he was in a tomb dead completely dead
[41:23] totally dead and now he's alive
[41:27] and the tomb is empty amen
[41:31] so why are we looking for another body
[41:34] if god can change his he can change mine
[41:37] amen if he can that's why i look to that
[41:41] i look to that and
[41:42] because what denomination says no we're
[41:44] going to throw this one away and get us
[41:45] a new one
[41:49] the great mystery is is this was born in
[41:51] sin
[41:52] and it's going to be changed that's
[41:54] right just like jesus body because he
[41:56] said we'll have a body
[41:57] like unto his glorious body
[42:01] as it was in the days of sodom so shall
[42:02] be in the coming of the son of man
[42:04] look at that angel there to the church
[42:06] elect now what's he talking about he's
[42:08] talking about the type of abraham
[42:11] was met by whom melchizedek
[42:15] there in uh i think it was uh genesis 18
[42:17] somewhere in there
[42:18] 19 he was met by a man
[42:22] in human flesh and he called him lord
[42:26] he knew who that man was see then met
[42:29] him
[42:30] a year or two later i mean before that
[42:31] when he gave him
[42:33] communion when he came back from the
[42:34] slaughter of the king so he knew who
[42:35] that guy was
[42:36] but there was two other angels with him
[42:38] though
[42:39] in this scenario that you see well what
[42:42] happened
[42:44] look at that angel there to the church
[42:45] elect
[42:48] god stayed and talked to abraham because
[42:51] the two other prophets went where
[42:54] they went to sodom right the two angels
[42:58] two preachers went to sodom to what
[43:01] blind their eyes brother brown said a
[43:03] modern billy graham and oral roberts
[43:05] they didn't have the full word they had
[43:07] the word
[43:08] they had the word for their time people
[43:10] were saved under their ministry because
[43:12] they
[43:13] listen lot was saved because of them two
[43:16] angels lot and his family got out of
[43:19] that place they were in right
[43:22] that's the church nominal though that's
[43:24] not the elect
[43:25] the elect stayed on the hill with god
[43:29] abraham was the elect type of us because
[43:31] what happened next
[43:33] he took a body change so he could
[43:36] conceive
[43:37] and have that promised child he and
[43:39] sarah both
[43:40] so jesus said it was the days of sodom
[43:42] so shall be in the coming of the son of
[43:43] man look at that angel down there to the
[43:45] church elect
[43:47] to what he done look at jesus what he's
[43:49] done in his generation
[43:50] look down here in this generation what
[43:52] he's doing now and he's going to bring
[43:53] it in
[43:54] they'll receive a sign but they won't
[43:56] believe it
[43:59] now the prophet of god for years
[44:03] he had prayer lines he had discernment
[44:05] he would tell
[44:07] visions he would tell prophecy he
[44:09] preached the word of god
[44:11] and they loved him just like they loved
[44:13] jesus when he was feeding the 5 000 and
[44:15] healing the sick
[44:18] but when he started preaching his
[44:21] they turned him down
[44:24] now that's they received the sign the
[44:26] sign was
[44:28] just like uh sorry moses started saying
[44:31] no
[44:31] moses was given remember god come to
[44:33] moses and said moses i'm gonna give you
[44:34] some some signs here
[44:37] and i want you to produce these signs to
[44:38] the people and she sure did
[44:40] destroy the whole country because of
[44:43] those signs
[44:44] and then he sends the same thing he
[44:46] sends an angel to
[44:48] brother branham and he says i've been
[44:50] here sent from the
[44:51] from the throne of god to give you a
[44:53] message to give you a commission you'll
[44:55] pray for the sick you'll pray for kings
[44:57] you'll pray for
[44:58] um kings potentates and all the
[45:01] different people and he's like man i'm a
[45:02] kentucky guy
[45:03] he actually was sitting in a cave in a
[45:05] hole when the angel met him
[45:08] right that's why the angel came in the
[45:09] room he was sitting in that cave up
[45:11] there somewhere up in the mountains in
[45:12] kentucky or in
[45:13] indiana or kentucky and he was sitting
[45:16] there praying and this angel just walks
[45:17] into the room you know and tells him
[45:19] what his commission is
[45:20] and you know what he said nothing will
[45:24] stand in your way
[45:25] not even cancer he said you get the
[45:28] people to believe
[45:29] you and he said nothing will stand in
[45:32] your way
[45:33] not even cancer and we saw that
[45:36] nothing stood in that man's way but boy
[45:39] look at it now though
[45:42] people are standing in the way of
[45:43] everything but you know what they didn't
[45:44] receive the real sign
[45:46] the real sign is not me standing up here
[45:49] and
[45:49] telling all y'all you your past and what
[45:51] you're thinking now thank god
[45:53] and all these other things right
[45:58] it's preaching the word of god under the
[46:00] same inspiration
[46:02] and the same revelation that he come to
[46:05] because remember he come to a place in
[46:07] the second part of his ministry
[46:08] he said not in the years of preparation
[46:10] that was a sign
[46:11] to turn you what does the sign do it
[46:14] points you in the right direction
[46:16] if you'll follow it there's some of you
[46:20] in here
[46:20] argue with a sign a stop sign
[46:23] get over it because your sign is sending
[46:27] you in a direction and that's the
[46:28] direction you need to go
[46:32] but they'll receive a sign but they
[46:33] won't believe it
[46:36] oh they love brother branham when he was
[46:37] healing the sick and
[46:39] raising the dead and you know what he
[46:42] done
[46:43] he poured hundreds of thousands of
[46:45] people into their churches
[46:48] because they went message churches
[46:49] everywhere he'd get them saved and born
[46:51] again now what'd he say he said you go
[46:53] back to your church and he said let your
[46:54] light shine
[46:55] there was nothing else he could do but
[46:56] send them back to the church
[46:59] so they didn't receive a sign no he was
[47:01] just a good man he was just a good man
[47:02] during his time
[47:04] but you know the pentecostal said oh
[47:05] said when he started preaching his
[47:06] message he messed up
[47:08] no they messed up because they didn't
[47:10] move on with him they cabbage down on
[47:12] the gifts
[47:14] which is great the healing and the signs
[47:16] and the wonders listen that's wonderful
[47:20] but that wasn't what he was sent for he
[47:24] was sent to take a bride
[47:26] that was going to destroy death
[47:30] by the resurrection sign
[47:33] he said what you see in part he said one
[47:36] day you're going to see in its fullness
[47:38] now if that was part
[47:41] what are we looking at if that was part
[47:45] millions of people healed hundreds of
[47:48] thousands of discernment not one of them
[47:50] wrong
[47:52] that's right even talent told that one
[47:53] girl he was gonna you know
[47:55] she was blind started praying for her
[47:58] and he
[47:59] he said he took her to his bosom and he
[48:01] he said
[48:03] took her back said oh i forgot to ask
[48:05] what color eyes do you want
[48:08] that was god but see that's not going to
[48:11] save you
[48:13] that's not going to make you believe
[48:14] this message but it's a sign to you
[48:16] that there was a resurrection fixing to
[48:18] happen in a group of people
[48:21] the greatest healing that we're going to
[48:23] get is not that god's going to heal you
[48:25] of your
[48:25] ailment my biggest ailment is sin
[48:34] count all them other things you won't do
[48:36] what's keeping us here
[48:38] is unbelief brother branham what sin
[48:42] smoking drinking cussing ran around he
[48:43] said
[48:44] nope the number one sin is unbelief
[48:48] so now that we know that let's get rid
[48:51] of the unbelief
[48:53] because i'll promise you there will be
[48:55] signs and wonders
[48:56] carrying this thing up too brother
[48:58] braham said when the door of the gentile
[49:00] church is closed
[49:01] he said god will do in a year what
[49:03] theologists tried to do in 2000 years
[49:06] he said but it's happening now why it
[49:08] was happening in his ministry
[49:10] and listen he didn't shut the book and
[49:12] go home
[49:14] he handed it to john john or john took
[49:16] it from the from the
[49:17] angel he didn't take it from brother
[49:19] branham
[49:20] but it came just the same an evil and
[49:22] adulterous generation will seek after a
[49:23] sign
[49:25] and they'll have it it'll be given to
[49:27] them
[49:29] as jonah was in the belly of the well
[49:35] i missed oh three days a night so the
[49:37] son of man will be in the heart of the
[49:38] earth three days and three nights we
[49:39] know that's the resurrection look
[49:40] but the resurrection will be the sign
[49:43] and the resurrection
[49:44] the sign is given to the church in this
[49:46] last day
[49:48] you see there was a lot of great men
[49:49] back in the church ages a lot of great
[49:51] men that had a lot of miracles
[49:53] but they didn't have the miracles they
[49:54] could stand and tell a hundred people
[49:57] night after night where they were what
[49:59] color shoes they had on
[50:00] what house number they lived at and was
[50:03] exactly accurate every time
[50:09] that was our sign but now are we going
[50:12] to get
[50:12] are we going to get blinded by the light
[50:17] of that are we going to become the light
[50:20] of that
[50:21] because if you become the light of that
[50:23] you can't get blinded
[50:26] if you're looking at something and it's
[50:28] really
[50:29] bright you're going to get blinded but
[50:31] if you become the light
[50:33] you'll never get blinded so that's why
[50:35] we had to move into this next part of
[50:37] the
[50:38] of the ministry and i'm trying to get
[50:39] this to us because until we get into
[50:42] this next part of the ministry
[50:43] there's no two witnesses going to israel
[50:46] read between the lines two witnesses are
[50:49] not going over there do we get out of
[50:52] here
[50:54] so the angel of the holy spirit in the
[50:57] meeting
[50:58] showing the same thing doing the same
[51:00] thing across the nation
[51:01] proving that jesus christ is raised from
[51:03] the dead just the same yesterday today
[51:04] and forever
[51:05] that's the generation that will
[51:09] receive it listen that's our generation
[51:14] that's us there's not another generation
[51:18] sorry there will not be another 40 years
[51:20] on this earth i'll promise you
[51:22] well they may be ain't going to be here
[51:28] i'm talking about we're going to be in
[51:29] heaven i ain't talking about being dead
[51:34] but as we read before
[51:37] this whole thing's based on resurrection
[51:41] so we've got to have a resurrection and
[51:43] a rapture before the two witnesses come
[51:45] and then you know what they preach
[51:47] 1260 days and then they have a rapture
[51:50] all right so let's go to the next one
[51:52] there based on resurrection resurrection
[51:54] the state of having passed completely
[51:55] through death and having risen from
[51:56] death
[51:57] to be in a resurrection is different
[51:58] than to be alive why because the bible
[52:00] says alive and remain
[52:02] shall not forever hinder those of the
[52:03] seed we're going to read that in a
[52:04] minute to be alive is the original state
[52:06] without having passed through death
[52:09] that's why paul said we which are alive
[52:11] and remain
[52:14] because we don't go through death
[52:17] to be in resurrection is to have passed
[52:19] through death and been raised
[52:22] up i thought jesus did all that for us
[52:26] so why do we have to do that
[52:29] that's the question we need to ask
[52:31] ourselves why do we have to go to
[52:33] funerals now
[52:34] we're not supposed to according to
[52:36] according to the end time message we're
[52:38] supposed to
[52:40] destroy death not by putting on some
[52:43] superhuman
[52:44] shirt or or or some kind of something no
[52:47] it's by the word of god
[52:49] how did jesus defeat the devil how did
[52:51] god himself
[52:53] defeat the devil by the word
[52:57] he didn't throw him no sign he didn't
[52:59] throw him no uh create something
[53:01] no he said it is written it is written
[53:05] it is written revelations 20 verse 4
[53:08] said i saw thrones and they that sounded
[53:10] on them judgment was given
[53:11] upon them and judgment was given unto
[53:13] them
[53:15] and i saw the souls of them that were
[53:17] beheaded for the witness of jesus and
[53:18] for the word of god
[53:20] see look i saw the souls of them that
[53:23] were beheaded for the witness of jesus
[53:26] for the word of god and which had not
[53:29] worshipped the beast
[53:30] neither his image neither had received
[53:34] his mark upon their forehead
[53:36] now that's the people that are still
[53:37] here the bride's the only one do you
[53:41] hear me the bride
[53:42] is the only one that does not take the
[53:44] mark of the beast
[53:46] the foolish virgin and the church they
[53:49] receive that mark of the beast because
[53:50] listen the mark of the beast is where
[53:53] in the forehead in the fate you're
[53:54] thinking not 666 stamped on your
[53:57] forehead
[54:00] it's what you're thinking he's getting
[54:03] you to think
[54:04] another revelation or another
[54:07] denomination
[54:08] or another twist on the word of god
[54:12] but these did not this is the first
[54:15] resurrection these people
[54:17] overcame the beast
[54:22] and they lived and reigned with christ
[54:23] for a thousand years but the rest of the
[54:24] dead lived not again until the thousand
[54:26] years were finished
[54:27] this is the first resurrection that's
[54:29] the one we're looking for
[54:31] first resurrection blessed and holy is
[54:34] he that hath part in the first
[54:35] resurrection on such the second death
[54:38] hath no power listen you come up in the
[54:40] first resurrection
[54:42] you don't die again but now some of them
[54:45] are going to come up in the second
[54:46] resurrection and they're going to die
[54:47] again
[54:48] they're actually going to be annihilated
[54:50] they're going to go out of existence if
[54:52] you don't have the
[54:54] that gives me chills
[54:58] but they shall be priest of god and of
[55:00] christ and shall reign with him one
[55:01] thousand
[55:03] years all right first thessalonians 4
[55:05] 13.
[55:06] we read this yesterday
[55:10] but i wouldn't i have you ignorant now
[55:12] look
[55:14] it's okay to be ignorant but it's not
[55:18] okay to stay ignorant
[55:20] being ignorant of something is just it's
[55:22] not it's not a dummy you just don't know
[55:24] what's going on in that one position
[55:26] i'm ignorant when it comes to
[55:27] electricity and and computers and
[55:30] how car runs that doesn't make me a
[55:33] dummy i know some things
[55:35] but if i were to go to school learn how
[55:36] to do electricity i would not be
[55:38] ignorant of that same way with the word
[55:40] of god
[55:40] some say well i don't understand this so
[55:42] i don't that's not an excuse
[55:45] not in this end time it's not an excuse
[55:47] to say well i don't understand this so
[55:49] i'll just put that over that way
[55:50] no everything remember the all the ropes
[55:53] got to be tied back together
[55:54] all right
[55:58] but i want to have you ignorant brother
[55:59] and concerning them with your sleeve we
[56:00] got the two witnesses yet
[56:02] okay that you start not even as others
[56:04] which have no hope look
[56:06] have no hope i went to funerals
[56:12] where the people that were buried had no
[56:13] hope
[56:15] unless at the very end
[56:18] they came to a center salvation because
[56:22] of the life that they lived
[56:26] and then what do you do you just hope
[56:31] well see there's people that we've
[56:33] buried that i don't hope i'll ever see
[56:35] them again
[56:36] i know i'm going to see them again why
[56:39] because the life they lived and the word
[56:41] of god that they lived under in
[56:43] and the and the like i said yesterday
[56:45] the name
[56:47] that you carry with you all right
[56:50] for if we believe that jesus died and
[56:52] rose again
[56:53] even so then which are sleeping jesus
[56:56] will god bring with him for this we say
[56:59] unto you by the word of the lord that we
[57:00] which are alive there's that alive see
[57:03] we're not going through that we're going
[57:04] to be alive
[57:06] and remain unto the coming of the lord
[57:08] shall not prevent them which are sleep
[57:10] that's what we're doing now we're
[57:11] preventing them
[57:12] for the lord himself shall descend from
[57:14] heaven with a shout
[57:16] now listen like i said before if you
[57:19] read that
[57:19] you go well something's gonna maybe
[57:22] there's one day this something's gonna
[57:23] just go
[57:24] hey no
[57:27] we've already had the shout out
[57:30] according to the message we've already
[57:31] had the shout
[57:32] out that shout turned us away from that
[57:35] old thinking that we had
[57:36] and turned us to the real thinking not a
[57:39] new thinking listen this might be new to
[57:41] us but it's not new to god
[57:43] okay for the lord himself shall descend
[57:46] from heaven with a shout
[57:48] what was revelations 10. the mighty
[57:51] angel came
[57:52] down from heaven with an open book in
[57:55] his hand
[57:57] and how why did he do that
[58:00] there was a people here to receive it
[58:04] listen god doesn't do anything without
[58:06] somebody here to receive it
[58:09] it doesn't matter if it's just going to
[58:10] be five people or two people or one
[58:12] person
[58:13] for the lord himself shall descend from
[58:15] heaven with a shout a message
[58:18] the voice of the archangel what is that
[58:20] the resurrection message
[58:23] and with the trump of god not to to do
[58:25] to do no
[58:27] we know what that trumpet says when it
[58:30] sounds
[58:31] right and it's not going to be a to do
[58:34] to do
[58:35] it's going to be a voice it's going to
[58:38] be a voice
[58:40] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[58:45] then we which are alive and remain
[58:49] shall be caught up remember there is no
[58:51] such thing as a rapture in the bible but
[58:53] we know that's what that is
[58:55] because remember the word rapture is
[58:56] ecstasy the rapture is a
[58:58] is a pinnacle or a height of something
[59:01] that you reach
[59:02] so we've got to get the dead out of the
[59:05] ground first
[59:06] and buddy once we see that it's going to
[59:10] cause a rapture
[59:13] the greatest ecstasy you'll ever see in
[59:15] your life
[59:16] will be for somebody that you know to
[59:18] walk back into this
[59:20] church and sit down
[59:25] because what can stop you then nothing
[59:29] nothing can stop you then
[59:32] then we which are alive and remain shall
[59:34] be caught up together with them in the
[59:35] clouds to meet the lord in the air
[59:38] and so shall we ever be with the lord
[59:40] look wherefore comfort
[59:42] one another with these words
[59:47] what is
[59:50] the trump of god
[59:55] it's a revelation that death can be
[59:59] destroyed
[1:00:00] in a human being this die
[1:00:04] to me that's the great mystery that
[1:00:06] satan can't even understand because see
[1:00:08] he knows the day you were born
[1:00:09] right he know you were born in sin he
[1:00:12] knew because listen he was the one that
[1:00:14] that made eve do what she did remember
[1:00:17] got her to do what she did and guess
[1:00:19] what that's the way we've all come
[1:00:22] now let's go to first corinthians 15 51
[1:00:26] behold i show you a mystery no
[1:00:29] paul said behold
[1:00:32] i'm going to show you a mystery in other
[1:00:35] words i'm not going to hide it
[1:00:37] i'm going to show it to you behold i
[1:00:40] show you a mystery we shall not all
[1:00:43] sleep
[1:00:45] but we shall be changed in a moment in
[1:00:49] the twinkling of an eye
[1:00:50] there's that trump again at the last
[1:00:52] trump for the trumpet shall sound
[1:00:54] and we know what that trumpet says
[1:00:59] and the dead shall be raised
[1:01:00] incorruptible
[1:01:03] now look let me ask you a question
[1:01:09] right now you're living under that
[1:01:13] right i'm sorry
[1:01:16] as pretty as you are you're corruption
[1:01:26] don't pass out okay i shouldn't use that
[1:01:29] sound
[1:01:30] but we all are we were born in sin we
[1:01:32] were born in corruption
[1:01:34] jesus's body was corrupting jesus it was
[1:01:36] dying it hadn't corrupt didn't corrupt
[1:01:38] in the grave but it was dying right
[1:01:42] look watch and the dead shall be raised
[1:01:44] i said look at this yes it shall be
[1:01:45] raised increa oh no just a little while
[1:01:47] ago raised incorruptible now
[1:01:51] where are they laying down in the grave
[1:01:54] in corruption
[1:01:54] their body there's a lot of saints that
[1:01:57] were that died in the first church age
[1:01:59] you probably can't even find their body
[1:02:02] dust ashes but god knows where they are
[1:02:07] my heavens if he created it he ought to
[1:02:08] know where he's at it doesn't matter if
[1:02:10] it went through a drain and all down
[1:02:12] into the ocean he knows where it's at
[1:02:13] because remember the bible says
[1:02:14] the body's going to come out of the sea
[1:02:16] and they're going to come out of this
[1:02:17] place and they're going to come out of
[1:02:18] that place
[1:02:19] but look if we were this this should
[1:02:21] have said according to
[1:02:23] what everybody believes except the true
[1:02:25] believers
[1:02:27] and the dead shall be raised in a new
[1:02:32] body
[1:02:34] because you can't put this word in here
[1:02:37] unless it was here to begin with
[1:02:41] that's just something you understand
[1:02:42] what i mean okay
[1:02:45] so it had to be corruptable
[1:02:49] but now it's raised incorruptible so
[1:02:52] whatever that corruptable is
[1:02:54] god's going to raise it by the power of
[1:02:56] transformation
[1:02:58] by the power of change he's going to
[1:03:00] make it incorruptible
[1:03:03] same way with mortal this mortal today
[1:03:06] you're mortal
[1:03:07] all of you but jesus reached immortality
[1:03:12] he had a mortal body and if and if it
[1:03:15] was just
[1:03:16] to get a new one that one would have
[1:03:19] been left in the tomb
[1:03:22] and you can't read the bible with
[1:03:24] something
[1:03:25] left in the tomb because it had to be
[1:03:27] raised
[1:03:29] incorruptible
[1:03:32] so to me that proves now we know when
[1:03:35] you say
[1:03:35] new body we'll cover that maybe later on
[1:03:39] listen i'm not going to look 61 years
[1:03:42] old
[1:03:42] i'm not going to have wrinkles in gray
[1:03:44] hair right
[1:03:46] it is going to be a new body but it's
[1:03:48] not going to be another body
[1:03:51] it's going to be this body made new
[1:03:53] because one time it was corruptable
[1:03:56] by what mama and daddy brought but by
[1:03:58] the power of the holy ghost
[1:04:00] and even if we have to lay it down into
[1:04:02] the ground
[1:04:03] it's going to be raised incorruptible
[1:04:09] to me that's real simple but most other
[1:04:12] 99
[1:04:13] of the people and most in the message
[1:04:16] don't think there's enough power of god
[1:04:17] i don't guess
[1:04:18] to change pulse it changed this vile
[1:04:22] body
[1:04:24] my it started to change when you got the
[1:04:26] new birth
[1:04:28] i won't get on that anymore we got to
[1:04:29] get to the two witnesses for this
[1:04:30] corruptable
[1:04:31] must put on incorruption
[1:04:34] so this corruptible is going to put on
[1:04:36] incorruption not get another one
[1:04:39] put on in corruption and this mortal
[1:04:43] must put on immortality
[1:04:49] now look behold i show you a mystery
[1:04:54] now remember according to revelations 10
[1:04:57] 7
[1:04:58] the mystery of god should be finished
[1:05:02] right that's what he said this bible
[1:05:05] so it says right here paul says behold i
[1:05:07] show you a mystery
[1:05:11] so somebody has got to get to revelation
[1:05:14] of
[1:05:14] that mystery not the mystery of the new
[1:05:16] birth not the mystery of
[1:05:18] not being but one god the mystery of
[1:05:20] water baptism that should already be
[1:05:22] there
[1:05:24] but we should be at a higher plane to
[1:05:27] where we see the mystery is
[1:05:29] and i wrote myself a note somebody will
[1:05:32] get the revelation
[1:05:34] of that mystery because
[1:05:37] you can't say this if somebody
[1:05:41] didn't resurrect incorruptable
[1:05:46] and somebody's gonna have to be alive
[1:05:48] according to the other scripture alive
[1:05:49] and remain
[1:05:50] to call them out of the ground
[1:05:55] you say brother wait this is a fairy
[1:05:56] tale no it's very real
[1:05:58] it may be a fairy tale to you it may be
[1:06:00] a fairy tale to the world
[1:06:01] but it's not a fairy tale to me it's the
[1:06:03] truth and it will happen
[1:06:07] listen you can't stop it from happening
[1:06:10] all your unbelief cannot heap up and
[1:06:11] stop it from happening
[1:06:13] because the whole world is against this
[1:06:14] and they're not going to stop it from
[1:06:16] happening
[1:06:17] amen so now let's go to revelations 4 1.
[1:06:20] and after this i look
[1:06:21] behold the door was opened in heaven
[1:06:25] somebody caught that mystery and the
[1:06:28] first voice
[1:06:29] which i heard was as it were what now
[1:06:31] there's another trumpet
[1:06:34] talking with me now what did john
[1:06:38] type he typed the bride
[1:06:41] not the church john
[1:06:44] type the bride not the church he tapped
[1:06:46] the bride
[1:06:48] so the bride he i heard was it where a
[1:06:51] trumpet talking with me which said
[1:06:54] come up hither
[1:06:57] and i'm going to pull you up that door
[1:07:04] you say well you're misquoting it i
[1:07:05] don't think so
[1:07:07] come up hither come up hither i'm going
[1:07:10] to draw you through that door you can't
[1:07:14] listen john didn't say i looked and
[1:07:16] there was a door
[1:07:17] on earth and i just walked right in it
[1:07:20] no there was a door in heaven heavenly
[1:07:23] places
[1:07:24] not way up there in heaven it was a
[1:07:26] place john couldn't get
[1:07:28] to on earth it had to open in heaven
[1:07:31] and a voice had to call me and you up
[1:07:34] out of that what
[1:07:36] prophet god said one time out of dead
[1:07:37] denomination that's and that don't mean
[1:07:39] baptism or methods that means our
[1:07:41] denomination come up
[1:07:43] hither and i will show thee things which
[1:07:46] must be hereafter
[1:07:48] and immediately i was in the spirit i
[1:07:50] was changing the moment in twinkling
[1:07:54] immediately i was in the spirit behold a
[1:07:55] throne was set in heaven and
[1:07:57] one there's that one guy again there's
[1:08:00] that one god
[1:08:02] sitting on the throne now let's we'll
[1:08:04] get to matthew 17 but let me
[1:08:06] make a comment here because catching
[1:08:09] away is what
[1:08:11] rapture we just talked about that
[1:08:13] rapture's not even in the bible
[1:08:14] it's catching away but it is the rapture
[1:08:17] is a culmination of all the bible what
[1:08:19] happens in the bible
[1:08:21] there will be a rapture or a pinnacle
[1:08:24] or an ecstasy that man has never
[1:08:28] never reached before
[1:08:31] now jesus did because he went in the
[1:08:32] resurrection i mean he went over
[1:08:34] in his rapture so now listen
[1:08:38] this catching away though if john typed
[1:08:41] the bride
[1:08:42] then see this is not to the this is not
[1:08:44] to the church
[1:08:48] that's right it's not to the church why
[1:08:50] are y'all so sleepy
[1:08:57] maybe you need to take something take a
[1:08:59] holy ghost pill before you walk in the
[1:09:01] door
[1:09:04] i know that hurts your feelings but i'm
[1:09:06] sorry
[1:09:07] you don't fall asleep when you're
[1:09:08] watching gun smoke
[1:09:10] gun smoke who watches gun smoke anymore
[1:09:12] you know what gun smoke is
[1:09:14] she's like
[1:09:18] but listen the catching away though is
[1:09:20] not for the foolish virgin
[1:09:22] or 90 of the world 99 of the world
[1:09:26] that's why it's a secret that's why and
[1:09:28] then the more secret is
[1:09:30] is that the denominational world says
[1:09:32] well if we miss the first one we'll get
[1:09:34] the second one
[1:09:36] you know that left behind or whatever
[1:09:38] that was the movie
[1:09:40] i mean that was made by the antichrist
[1:09:43] it wasn't
[1:09:43] it wasn't showing the antichrist in the
[1:09:45] end it was made by the antichrist
[1:09:47] because i promise you the bible says you
[1:09:50] missed the first resurrection
[1:09:52] you're going to die twice
[1:09:55] right which the second death has no hold
[1:09:59] amen so i don't know how in the world
[1:10:00] you can miss one and not get
[1:10:02] well anyway and get saved during that
[1:10:04] time
[1:10:05] because even the foolish virgin listen
[1:10:07] the foolish virgin can't get saved
[1:10:10] full of the holy ghost you understand
[1:10:11] what i mean well this virgin came to get
[1:10:13] the holy ghost
[1:10:14] during the tribulation period nobody can
[1:10:16] get listen when we go in
[1:10:18] a rapture the gentile age is over
[1:10:21] there's no other nations is going to be
[1:10:23] saved it's going to be two witnesses
[1:10:25] that go to
[1:10:25] jerusalem and they take out 144 thousand
[1:10:29] twelve thousand out of each tribe and
[1:10:30] that's it
[1:10:33] so let's go to matthew 17 verse one and
[1:10:36] after six days jesus
[1:10:38] taking peter james and john his brother
[1:10:39] and brings him up to a high mountain
[1:10:41] apart
[1:10:42] and was transfigured before them and his
[1:10:43] face did shine as the sun as raiment was
[1:10:45] white as light
[1:10:46] and behold they appeared to them moses
[1:10:48] and elias or elijah
[1:10:51] talking with him now how in the world
[1:10:53] they know that's moses and elijah they
[1:10:55] want no
[1:10:55] youtube or there wasn't no facebook or
[1:10:59] or facetime
[1:11:03] they got a revelation that if jesus was
[1:11:05] standing there
[1:11:06] with two men it had to be moses and
[1:11:08] elijah because elijah's got to come back
[1:11:10] because that shows the second coming of
[1:11:12] christ
[1:11:15] because who's writing this matthew's
[1:11:16] writing this he wasn't even there
[1:11:18] he wasn't up on the mountain it was
[1:11:20] peter james and john
[1:11:22] peter james and john and jesus all right
[1:11:24] so there's your two witnesses now let's
[1:11:26] go to revelation 11
[1:11:27] 3. i told you we'd get there and i will
[1:11:30] give power unto my two witnesses
[1:11:34] now what is power dunamis they're going
[1:11:36] to get the holy ghost
[1:11:38] after we leave because if we get the
[1:11:41] holy ghost before we leave they go in
[1:11:42] the rapture
[1:11:44] so you got to be careful with that
[1:11:46] because there are two witnesses that go
[1:11:48] over there so they get the holy ghost
[1:11:49] somewhere
[1:11:50] and i will give power to my two
[1:11:51] witnesses because i
[1:11:54] and it's not in there but it's but you
[1:11:56] think that i mean as soon as our rapture
[1:11:58] takes place
[1:12:00] as soon as we go to the marriage supper
[1:12:02] i don't think the very next second
[1:12:04] they're going to start preaching
[1:12:06] it's going to develop they're going to
[1:12:08] preach
[1:12:09] 1260 days that's the promise of
[1:12:12] preaching 1260 days
[1:12:14] all right and they shall prophesy or
[1:12:15] preach a thousand
[1:12:17] 203 square days clothed in sackcloth
[1:12:20] these are the two olive trees and the
[1:12:22] two candlesticks standing before the god
[1:12:24] of the earth
[1:12:25] and if any man will hurt them fire
[1:12:27] listen they're not going to be a fire
[1:12:28] breathing dragon
[1:12:32] what what they say is going to come to
[1:12:34] pass
[1:12:36] they have authority but you know who
[1:12:38] we're going to have to have that same
[1:12:40] authority to get out of here
[1:12:42] it's just going to move from here over
[1:12:43] to there
[1:12:45] and if any man will hurt them fire
[1:12:47] proceedeth out of their mouth and devour
[1:12:49] their enemies
[1:12:50] and if any man will hurt them he must in
[1:12:52] this manner be killed in other words
[1:12:54] what they
[1:12:54] needed to them they're going to meet
[1:12:56] right back these have power to shut
[1:12:58] heaven
[1:12:59] that it rained on in the days of their
[1:13:00] prophecy now who did that
[1:13:03] who did that when they were here elijah
[1:13:05] remember he said it won't rain for three
[1:13:07] and a half years
[1:13:10] and have power over water to turn to
[1:13:12] blood who did that
[1:13:14] moses the nile river turned to blood and
[1:13:17] to smite the earth with all plagues as
[1:13:19] often as they will
[1:13:21] and when they shall have finished their
[1:13:22] testimony in other words during this
[1:13:24] time they're preaching the word of god
[1:13:26] they're going to call out 144 000 and
[1:13:29] they're going to get born again
[1:13:31] now they're not going to be bribed
[1:13:32] because remember the bride's already
[1:13:34] gone
[1:13:35] the church is going through tribulation
[1:13:38] not the bride bride's gone church in 144
[1:13:42] thousand is going to i mean i'm sorry
[1:13:45] the foolish version are going to go
[1:13:46] through the tribulation period
[1:13:48] god's going to be speaking to these 144
[1:13:51] thousand
[1:13:52] they are going to what receive that
[1:13:54] message
[1:13:55] because we're going to read it here in
[1:13:56] just a minute and when they shall have
[1:13:58] finished their testimony and the beasts
[1:14:00] that ascended out of the bottomless pit
[1:14:01] shall make war against them
[1:14:03] and shall overcome them and kill them
[1:14:06] now
[1:14:07] who is this beast
[1:14:11] the pope the man of sin
[1:14:16] who's not going to be able to work and
[1:14:19] incarnate a man
[1:14:20] until god incarnates us and takes us out
[1:14:22] of here
[1:14:23] amen god's got to incarnate us first
[1:14:27] when satan sees god incarnate us
[1:14:30] he's going to know how to do it and he's
[1:14:32] going to go over there and do it
[1:14:34] and then he's going to do we'll read in
[1:14:35] just a minute daniel 12 verse 7
[1:14:39] and i heard the man clothed in london
[1:14:40] which was upon the waters of the river
[1:14:42] when he held up his right hand and his
[1:14:43] left hand of the heaven
[1:14:44] now look revelations 10 7
[1:14:48] there was a man put one foot on land and
[1:14:51] one foot on sea
[1:14:53] and said time shall be no longer that's
[1:14:55] gentiles
[1:14:56] our time will be over at that time
[1:15:01] but israel is given
[1:15:04] 1260 days or three and one half years
[1:15:07] right who is daniel daniel's a jew so
[1:15:10] they're getting their jewish prophecy
[1:15:12] like i said before
[1:15:13] the book of daniel is the book of
[1:15:15] revelations to the jew
[1:15:17] and i heard the man clothed in linen
[1:15:19] which was upon the waters of the river
[1:15:20] when he held up his right hand
[1:15:22] and his left hand unto heaven and swear
[1:15:24] by him that liveth forever and ever that
[1:15:26] shall be for a
[1:15:27] time times
[1:15:32] and a dividing of time one
[1:15:35] two three and a half years got that
[1:15:39] time times
[1:15:42] and uh half
[1:15:46] three and a half years and when he shall
[1:15:47] have accomplished to scatter the power
[1:15:49] of the holy people
[1:15:51] all these things shall be finished and i
[1:15:53] heard but understood not and i said oh
[1:15:55] my lord
[1:15:56] what shall be the end of these things
[1:15:57] remember daniel is wanting to know
[1:15:58] what's going to happen to his people
[1:16:02] and he said go thy way daniel for the
[1:16:03] words are closed up
[1:16:05] and sealed until the time of the end
[1:16:09] many shall be purified and made white
[1:16:12] and tried that's the bride but the
[1:16:15] wicked shall do wickedly and none of the
[1:16:16] wicked shall understand look but the
[1:16:18] wise
[1:16:20] the wise shall understand
[1:16:24] listen i don't have it there but in
[1:16:25] revelations 18 verse 23
[1:16:28] all nations will be deceived
[1:16:32] by the beast all nations
[1:16:36] all people will be deceived by this one
[1:16:39] beast
[1:16:40] he's going to have so much power and so
[1:16:42] much authority
[1:16:44] to but look the wise will understand me
[1:16:46] and you listen me and you won't have to
[1:16:47] deal with that guy
[1:16:49] we're gonna be gone but the church is
[1:16:52] gonna have to deal with him
[1:16:53] the foolish virgin these hundred forty
[1:16:56] four thousand let's go
[1:16:58] one more and then we'll close it's not
[1:17:00] eight thirty yet
[1:17:02] daniel 9 24 70 weeks are determined upon
[1:17:06] thy people
[1:17:07] and upon thy holy city to do six things
[1:17:10] to finish the transgression
[1:17:11] make an end of sins and to make
[1:17:13] reconciliation for iniquity
[1:17:15] now that first three part is what the
[1:17:18] 144 000 are going to receive the two
[1:17:21] prophets are going to preach
[1:17:22] jesus christ and it's going to do away
[1:17:24] with their sin
[1:17:26] just like me and you do away with their
[1:17:29] transgression finish it
[1:17:32] brother brown said the the the
[1:17:34] transgression is when they put him on
[1:17:35] the cross
[1:17:37] let his blood be on us and our children
[1:17:40] and to make reconciliation for iniquity
[1:17:44] they should have known better that was
[1:17:46] their messiah
[1:17:48] he came exactly the way their bible in
[1:17:50] the old testament said he would come
[1:17:53] now look and then to bring in
[1:17:55] everlasting righteousness
[1:17:57] seal up the vision and prophecy and to
[1:18:00] anoint the most holy
[1:18:01] and we know what the prophet of god said
[1:18:02] about that the north to most holy
[1:18:04] would be us the most anointed people
[1:18:07] riding back into the millennium and
[1:18:09] we'll get to that when we cover daniel
[1:18:11] 70 weeks maybe later on
[1:18:13] so let's read the 70th week of daniel
[1:18:16] i want to get to this right here and
[1:18:17] then we'll then we'll stop
[1:18:21] questions and answers 1953 then when the
[1:18:24] church is taken up and he's given us an
[1:18:26] order of what's going to happen then
[1:18:29] when the church is taken up
[1:18:30] now see it says church but you got to
[1:18:32] remember that's bride
[1:18:34] right that's not the church the church
[1:18:38] doesn't
[1:18:38] show up until after the thousand years
[1:18:40] is over with everybody got that
[1:18:43] you all okay can you say it man where i
[1:18:46] can hear it
[1:18:47] amen okay moses
[1:18:51] i'm getting hard of hearing in my old
[1:18:52] days
[1:18:54] i didn't think y'all said anything but
[1:18:56] moses and elijah look appears in
[1:18:58] revelation 11 and preaches
[1:19:00] jesus christ now
[1:19:03] they've been preached jesus christ for
[1:19:06] 2000 years
[1:19:08] and god still had their hand over their
[1:19:10] eyes but
[1:19:11] something pulled the hand off of their
[1:19:13] eyes when we went in a rapture
[1:19:17] it pulled a wall off their eyes or the
[1:19:20] hand
[1:19:20] and the holy spirit took from the
[1:19:22] gentiles look and the rapture comes from
[1:19:24] the church now that's bride we know that
[1:19:26] because the bride goes up
[1:19:29] in the first resurrection that was
[1:19:31] proven all right
[1:19:33] and the jews that's left here will be
[1:19:36] preached for three and a half years
[1:19:37] because he said they're 70 weeks
[1:19:39] and the messiah be cut off between them
[1:19:41] then he's taken away the gentiles will
[1:19:42] be given a place
[1:19:44] then they get three more years and a
[1:19:46] half to be preached to
[1:19:48] of jesus christ let's go to zechariah 12
[1:19:51] verse 10
[1:19:52] said and i will pour out upon the house
[1:19:55] of david
[1:19:55] upon the inhabitants of jerusalem now
[1:19:57] what what was david
[1:19:58] he's a jew david's a jew
[1:20:01] all right and watch the inhabitants of
[1:20:04] jerusalem
[1:20:05] jews the spirit of grace
[1:20:08] and of supplication and they shall look
[1:20:11] upon me
[1:20:12] whom they have pierced now who's that
[1:20:14] talking about jesus christ there's only
[1:20:16] one man that's been pierced like that
[1:20:18] and they shall mourn for him as one
[1:20:20] mourneth for his only son
[1:20:22] and shall be in bitterness for him as
[1:20:24] one that is in bitterness
[1:20:26] for his firstborn and that day there
[1:20:28] will be a great morning in jerusalem as
[1:20:30] the morning of
[1:20:31] hedorahmen in the valley of mcgidden
[1:20:34] they officially go back to the battle of
[1:20:35] armageddon here in just a little while
[1:20:36] so
[1:20:37] they get familiar with that valley but
[1:20:40] they mourn and in zechariah 13 6 and one
[1:20:42] shall say unto him
[1:20:44] what are these wounds in thine hands
[1:20:48] see jesus is not going to appear
[1:20:52] as if he hadn't appeared to be in you
[1:20:54] but i know he's got nail prints in his
[1:20:55] hand
[1:20:57] but he's going to do through the two
[1:20:59] witnesses preaching jesus christ
[1:21:01] they're going to say where are these
[1:21:03] wounds and what are these wounds
[1:21:05] then he shall say those which i was
[1:21:08] wounded
[1:21:10] in the house of my friends then like i
[1:21:12] said they're going to mourn
[1:21:14] and they're going to turn their face and
[1:21:15] they're going to say we're we're
[1:21:17] finished
[1:21:18] we're done he's going to kill us
[1:21:22] he's going to do away with us remember
[1:21:25] when joseph
[1:21:27] perfect type of christ joseph had
[1:21:30] brought his
[1:21:31] brothers right they had supposedly
[1:21:35] killed him
[1:21:36] however how many years ago that was
[1:21:37] thrown him in a ditch right
[1:21:39] so joseph goes to egypt gets elevated to
[1:21:42] the
[1:21:43] right hand of pharaoh right
[1:21:46] he gets to speak in another language and
[1:21:47] he's probably hit his face
[1:21:49] or got a different tan and they don't
[1:21:51] know who he is
[1:21:52] but he was joseph all the see it was
[1:21:56] jesus all the time
[1:21:58] that's who we got revealed to us
[1:22:01] but then what he's going to do is he's
[1:22:03] going to call his brethren
[1:22:06] who is his brethren the tribes of israel
[1:22:10] remember all of his brothers are the 12
[1:22:12] tribes of israel
[1:22:14] right so they're going to call
[1:22:19] he's going to call them and they're
[1:22:20] going to be in the
[1:22:22] in his presence through two witnesses
[1:22:27] and then what does the bible say he then
[1:22:29] he reveals itself
[1:22:32] to his brethren and what does his
[1:22:34] brethren say
[1:22:36] oh we've had it now here's this
[1:22:40] great man that rules
[1:22:43] all of egypt remember the bible said the
[1:22:46] only thing he wasn't was pharaoh
[1:22:49] pharaoh told him said whatever you do is
[1:22:51] your business and just
[1:22:52] i'm still pharaoh all right right
[1:22:56] so here's joseph and here's his brethren
[1:22:58] and they're standing around him and he
[1:22:59] reveals himself
[1:23:01] and they say oh man we're dead
[1:23:06] we supposedly killed the one that's
[1:23:09] getting ready
[1:23:10] we hope is going to save us right and he
[1:23:13] said
[1:23:13] don't worry he said god did this
[1:23:18] to preserve life
[1:23:21] remember there were seven years of
[1:23:22] famine there were seven years of good
[1:23:24] seven years of famine he said god did
[1:23:26] this
[1:23:28] to preserve life through seven church
[1:23:31] ages
[1:23:33] he held there couldn't see the mystery
[1:23:36] couldn't see joseph joseph was always
[1:23:38] there
[1:23:40] right nothing changed except him
[1:23:42] revealing himself
[1:23:44] he started speaking in their language
[1:23:45] and took his took his hat off or
[1:23:47] whatever he had on you know and he said
[1:23:49] i'm joseph
[1:23:50] and instead of them running up and
[1:23:51] grabbing him remember because he had to
[1:23:53] go run and grab benjamin
[1:23:56] they said we're dead and that's the same
[1:23:57] thing's going to happen when the two
[1:23:59] witnesses
[1:24:00] show those people that jesus christ was
[1:24:03] their savior and they put him on cross
[1:24:05] they said we're dead now where'd you get
[1:24:08] these wounds he said those which was
[1:24:09] wounded
[1:24:10] which i was wounded in the house
[1:24:14] of my friends so after the rapture of
[1:24:17] the church
[1:24:21] god's going to go to israel and he's
[1:24:24] going to reveal himself
[1:24:26] to israel and israel is going to mourn
[1:24:30] but they're not going to mourn for long
[1:24:32] because when they get to real revelation
[1:24:34] and they keep hearing that three and a
[1:24:35] half year message by those two prophets
[1:24:37] and they see the signs now you've got to
[1:24:40] be careful they see the signs they
[1:24:42] listen the jews want a sign right
[1:24:46] gentiles never needed a sign
[1:24:50] never needed a sign centurion says
[1:24:52] whatever you say you know i come to my
[1:24:56] house
[1:24:58] lady that was the bread crumbs and all
[1:24:59] the different things like that and he
[1:25:00] said i never have found faith in israel
[1:25:02] but what was the first thing jarius did
[1:25:04] come in here and put your hand lay your
[1:25:06] hands on my daughter
[1:25:07] israel needs somebody to assign
[1:25:12] where gentiles don't need a sign
[1:25:14] gentiles don't need that's what i said
[1:25:15] about laying on our hands
[1:25:17] that's good but that's not a gentile way
[1:25:20] gentile way is that centurion i have
[1:25:22] power you have power
[1:25:24] i have power for a hundred people and i
[1:25:26] tell them where to go what he was
[1:25:27] telling jesus was he said i know you got
[1:25:29] power
[1:25:30] over a hundred demons or everything
[1:25:31] whatever i know you got power
[1:25:33] you just speak and then i'll just go to
[1:25:36] the house
[1:25:38] but the jews had to wait on him they had
[1:25:40] to wait on the sign they had to wait on
[1:25:41] him to go around remember he
[1:25:42] remember he had to run them out of the
[1:25:44] house
[1:25:45] because of their unbelief he had to run
[1:25:48] them out of the house
[1:25:49] to awaken that girl
[1:25:53] so but but now god's so gracious though
[1:25:56] musicians come on god's so gracious
[1:26:00] so he's going to deal with that just
[1:26:01] like the way they like it
[1:26:04] he's going to send them two prophets
[1:26:06] that absolutely
[1:26:07] almost destroy the world just by what
[1:26:09] they say
[1:26:11] every sign every wonder
[1:26:16] fire proceedeth out of their mouth
[1:26:19] what they say will come to pass
[1:26:23] and the jews are going to say oh we've
[1:26:25] missed it let's stand our feet
[1:26:30] but i hope you see because the next
[1:26:31] section we go into
[1:26:34] is going to be with the jews and what
[1:26:36] happens because there's a man of sin
[1:26:37] comes in
[1:26:40] he sits in the temple of god showing
[1:26:41] himself to be as god
[1:26:44] takes over the world because we're not
[1:26:46] here
[1:26:47] the whole world's been taken over by him
[1:26:50] and listen if you don't have the new
[1:26:52] birth today
[1:26:54] you've got the same spirit that's going
[1:26:57] to
[1:26:58] be over there the spirit of antichrist
[1:27:01] i'm sorry
[1:27:02] but i mean you don't have to stay that
[1:27:04] way remember you can be ignorant
[1:27:06] but you can't don't have to stay that
[1:27:08] way there's a god that can take that
[1:27:10] away from you there's a god that can
[1:27:11] take that man of sin out of your life
[1:27:13] and you'll go in that first resurrection
[1:27:15] the first rapture let's sing a song 204
[1:27:18] what a day it will be if you have a need
[1:27:21] there is shall come
[1:27:30] no more clouds in the sky
[1:27:35] no more tears to dim the
[1:27:38] eyes all is
[1:27:48] [Music]
[1:27:50] listen you gotta believe that day is
[1:27:52] gonna happen
[1:27:53] and it's gonna happen to you
[1:27:57] oh what a day
[1:28:00] that will be when my
[1:28:04] jesus i shall sin
[1:28:07] when i look upon his face
[1:28:11] we're gonna see him at the rapture we're
[1:28:14] gonna meet him in the air
[1:28:15] we're gonna go spend three and a half
[1:28:17] years with him while he's dealing with
[1:28:18] the jews
[1:28:20] so we'll see him through that promised
[1:28:24] land
[1:28:26] what a day glorious day
[1:28:31] that will be
[1:28:35] there'll be no sorrow there won't have
[1:28:39] to go to a funeral
[1:28:46] [Music]
[1:28:49] but this is not a fairy tale folks this
[1:28:51] is the truth
[1:28:52] this is the truth it's never been spoken
[1:28:55] before
[1:28:56] this is the truth that god wanted us to
[1:28:58] see so he sent us a prophet but he gave
[1:29:01] us a five-fold ministry
[1:29:03] to break it down to the people so that
[1:29:05] you can understand
[1:29:06] and i can understand what's going on
[1:29:09] will be
[1:29:12] oh what a day that will be
[1:29:17] when my jesus i shall see
[1:29:22] when i look upon his face
[1:29:26] the one who saved me by his grace

[1:30:36] look upon his face
[1:30:39] the one who saved me by his grace
[1:30:44] when he takes me by the hand
[1:30:48] and leads me through the promised land
