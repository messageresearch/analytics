[17:00] way now and keep us in jesus name
[17:03] amen
[17:06] revelations 1 1 2 3
[17:10] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[17:12] gave unto him to shew into his servant
[17:14] things
[17:14] which must shortly come to pass and he
[17:17] said and signified it by his angel and
[17:19] to his servant john who by a record of
[17:21] the word of god in the morning
[17:23] of jesus christ and of all things that
[17:25] he saw
[17:26] blessed is he that readeth what about
[17:28] that just being able to read
[17:30] you know blessed is he that readeth and
[17:33] they that hear the words of this
[17:35] prophecy
[17:36] and keep those things which are written
[17:37] therein for the time
[17:40] is at hand remember all the bible
[17:43] is written in a prophecy so because it's
[17:45] a great and wonderful
[17:47] ability to read isn't it and especially
[17:50] to know what
[17:51] these things mean that's the main thing
[17:54] to know what they mean
[17:55] revelations 20 and i saw an angel come
[17:58] down from heaven having the key of the
[18:00] bottomless pit and a great chain in his
[18:02] hand
[18:02] and he laid hold on the dragon that old
[18:04] serpent which is the devil and satan
[18:07] and bound him a thousand years and cast
[18:09] him into the bottomless pit
[18:10] shut him up and set a seal upon him that
[18:13] he should
[18:14] just he that he should
[18:17] deceive the nations no more till a
[18:19] thousand years should be fulfilled
[18:21] and after that he must be loose a little
[18:24] season
[18:26] and i saw thrones and they that set upon
[18:28] them and judgment was given unto them
[18:31] and i saw the souls of them that were
[18:33] beheaded for the
[18:34] witness of jesus and for the word of god
[18:37] and which had not
[18:38] worshipped the beast nor his image
[18:40] neither had received his mark
[18:42] upon their foreheads or in their hands
[18:45] and they lived and reigned with christ a
[18:46] thousand years he two times it already
[18:49] thousand years but the rest of the dead
[18:51] lived not again until a thousand years
[18:54] were finished
[18:55] this is the first resurrection best and
[18:58] holy is he that have part in the first
[19:00] resurrection on
[19:01] such the second death have no part but
[19:03] they shall be priests
[19:05] of god and of christ and shall reign
[19:07] with him a thousand years
[19:08] four times now coming up number five
[19:12] and when the thousand years were expired
[19:13] satan should be loosed out of his prison
[19:17] when god says things on a
[19:21] repeated basis he means for us to
[19:24] understand
[19:25] or think about it right heavenly father
[19:28] we thank you
[19:29] we ask you now to just let our hearts
[19:32] and our lives be set on the resurrection
[19:35] we've done asking pray to you about it
[19:37] but we want one more time to just
[19:40] you just speak to us have your way now
[19:43] and guide us in jesus name
[19:45] you may be seated
[19:49] when god says something over and over it
[19:52] has a meaning to it
[19:54] the scripture there where it would say
[19:56] verily verily i say unto you
[19:59] you know very is enough but when he says
[20:02] verily verily
[20:03] it means listen when he says here and
[20:06] we've read what five or six times
[20:08] earlier it says
[20:09] a thousand years it means listen to
[20:10] think about that
[20:12] not to just um ponder it or
[20:15] wonder it or argue over as i say
[20:18] this morning a post millennials or a
[20:21] pre-millennialist
[20:22] or an all millennialist i never did
[20:24] understand the awe but
[20:25] they've got about three different
[20:26] millennial thoughts in there
[20:29] but you know to think about these things
[20:34] and to see that we will one day
[20:37] somebody's going to live a thousand
[20:39] years to prove the sin
[20:41] curse is gone now god don't have to do
[20:44] that
[20:46] he doesn't have to prove anything
[20:50] but he does it
[20:53] for you and i to be able to look at it
[20:55] and see the surety
[20:58] remember he even swore by himself now
[21:00] isn't that something
[21:02] to get something in other words for god
[21:04] to swear to you is
[21:06] is one thing and you know that's a great
[21:08] thing to stand on his promises
[21:09] but what about him swearing by himself
[21:13] that's that takes it into a deeper
[21:15] meaning if we would
[21:16] would understand you know and you know
[21:18] and and believe it
[21:21] but now we tried to cover this morning
[21:23] the
[21:24] the millennium and the thousand you know
[21:26] being the thousand-year
[21:28] reign and seeing that there would be a
[21:31] gospel to the heather and the prophet
[21:32] said during that
[21:34] millennial rain and that means we will
[21:36] have something
[21:37] or someone to rule and reign over not
[21:40] ruling ryan like
[21:41] uh hard things are being as i've brought
[21:44] out about the
[21:45] 144 thousand being the servants it
[21:48] doesn't mean servants in the basis of
[21:50] slaveries
[21:51] you know or somebody uh beaten if they
[21:54] don't do what they're supposed to do or
[21:56] whatever uh it's going to be a great
[21:58] utopia
[22:00] for a thousand years because it's
[22:02] recovered then satan is going to be
[22:04] bound
[22:07] he won't have anybody to work through
[22:09] his subjects brother
[22:11] and said will be in hell and that's the
[22:14] reason that
[22:15] he won't be able to do it he won't be
[22:17] able to work through and see if we could
[22:19] ever get it to the right place the
[22:20] prophet said one day he said
[22:23] they they asked him a question and you
[22:25] know and said i said brother brown
[22:26] you said that we could live so close to
[22:28] god
[22:29] that satan wouldn't know what to do with
[22:31] us he said that's right
[22:34] well you know you say but that's
[22:37] impossible for a human mortal
[22:40] well i remind you of a man that did not
[22:43] have the baptism of the holy ghost
[22:46] but yet he walked with god for
[22:50] the prophet say 500 years which you
[22:51] calculated in your own times
[22:54] there in genesis is 350 years
[22:58] and please god
[23:01] well now was every day so beautiful and
[23:04] wonderful and
[23:05] was he so you know holy and pious
[23:09] or what no he was a human being
[23:13] but he just had his mind on the lord he
[23:16] just thought about the lord
[23:18] and everything was involved and it was
[23:20] just tied up and about the lord
[23:22] you know well you know that would be
[23:25] great
[23:27] i mean like i've always said you know
[23:29] it'd be hard to to get mad at somebody
[23:31] when you're telling them that you love
[23:32] them
[23:33] when you don't ever tell the lord that
[23:35] you love him
[23:37] i mean you don't ever do that you don't
[23:39] ask the lord i love you
[23:42] if you cast me into hell i love you
[23:43] because you died for me
[23:47] you gave your life that i could live
[23:49] right amen
[23:50] the lord just tells me i love you uncle
[23:53] brother tom fox told me years ago he
[23:55] said
[23:56] that i love you and he said brother dale
[23:57] i want you to know
[23:59] if i don't love nobody i don't tell them
[24:01] i love them
[24:02] most of you that know brother tom know
[24:03] that that was the truth
[24:05] if he didn't love you he wasn't going to
[24:07] tell you he loved you
[24:08] well that's the way it ought to be with
[24:10] all of us you know about but we ought to
[24:11] be
[24:12] so much in love with the lord until no
[24:14] matter what he says or does
[24:17] right right around said it like this one
[24:19] day he said
[24:20] a no from god
[24:24] you know just find him saying no you
[24:26] can't have that
[24:28] he said that's wonderful because there's
[24:31] some reason
[24:32] you know that he knows about it
[24:35] and whatever we were like listening last
[24:37] night and i kind of got tickled
[24:39] it to him thinking about somebody else
[24:41] that had done it but
[24:42] he said they would own a we were coming
[24:44] from one place to another he said i've
[24:46] been there
[24:47] and he could he you've heard him tell so
[24:49] i can tell you every road from here to
[24:51] los angeles california and how long
[24:53] it'll take you to drive it
[24:55] you ever you know you've heard him say
[24:56] like that and he said him and the people
[24:58] got together
[24:59] and said they went i think 45 miles out
[25:01] in the wrong direction
[25:03] 50 miles or something out in the wrong
[25:05] direction
[25:08] you know he said but you know we don't
[25:10] know what we missed
[25:12] see that could have been some great
[25:14] disastrous thing taking place
[25:17] he said there we went all of us and he
[25:19] said i've traveled that road
[25:21] hundreds or something times is it the
[25:23] turn to go the wrong way
[25:25] well see that can be the hand of the
[25:28] lord taking care of us
[25:30] and we don't realize it well we just
[25:32] should go all the time then maybe that's
[25:34] the way
[25:35] you know giving him honor do you ever uh
[25:38] if i drop something in the grass and i'm
[25:40] looking for it and i find that you know
[25:42] what i do i say thank you lord
[25:44] you know why because i couldn't miss it
[25:46] and i found it just we need to thank him
[25:48] for everything
[25:50] and just be happy about it and not be
[25:53] well lord you owe me
[25:55] you know we should be happy and
[25:59] joyous or whatever to be because that
[26:01] should be the resurrection now they want
[26:02] to get to and talk about it okay
[26:06] now notice that we read here in the
[26:08] scriptures
[26:10] that it says that verse 5
[26:14] and the rest of the dead live not again
[26:18] until the thousand years were finished
[26:21] and once this is the first resurrection
[26:27] now i want to get on to that in a minute
[26:29] now watch
[26:31] blessed and holy is he that have part in
[26:34] the
[26:35] first resurrection on which
[26:39] the second death or such the second
[26:42] death have no power
[26:47] now i want us to think about the
[26:52] the resurrection now i believe
[26:55] and you know i know you know when i say
[26:58] things a lot of times
[26:59] uh sometimes i'll say something and i
[27:01] think people even say
[27:03] that what people will say well brother
[27:04] they'll run around and say it that way
[27:06] i try to say everything that i can that
[27:09] he says and
[27:10] and give understanding and things like
[27:12] that as much as i know
[27:14] and forgive me for what i don't know but
[27:17] you know
[27:19] the resurrection is when jesus was
[27:22] standing on earth as we'll get to in a
[27:24] minute
[27:25] you know and he spoke of the
[27:29] resurrection
[27:31] that that wasn't a new doctrine
[27:38] that was a an old one
[27:41] for a long time
[27:46] see job even back before the writing of
[27:48] the
[27:50] of genesis as we know
[27:53] that job i believe now whether you
[27:56] whatever you know
[27:57] it's all right i believe
[28:00] job believed in a last day resurrection
[28:04] now i believe that because you read it
[28:06] yes see now when he come over and said i
[28:08] know
[28:09] my redeemer liveth he saw the person of
[28:12] the resurrection
[28:14] right he he didn't see maybe the dead
[28:17] raising the
[28:18] the uh the things transpiring
[28:22] and he said i know my redeemer liveth in
[28:24] the last days that stand up on the earth
[28:26] not see for myself and not another all
[28:28] right that was something about the
[28:30] resurrection
[28:31] that mankind didn't know
[28:35] or why would it be saying i know see and
[28:37] i'm trying to give understanding
[28:39] i believe every person has ever lived
[28:41] upon the earth
[28:43] you know in one way or the other has a
[28:45] thought of a resurrection
[28:47] uh the old ending with a happy hunting
[28:49] ground or or whatever you know
[28:52] it would be tied together with it and uh
[28:55] you know we talk about the parasites and
[28:58] the sadducees
[28:59] and and and all that we'll say well the
[29:01] pharisees believed in the resurrection
[29:04] but the sadducees didn't believe in the
[29:05] resurrection
[29:07] you know they say that's why they're sad
[29:09] well now
[29:10] i'm just honest i believe the sadducees
[29:14] believed in a
[29:15] general end time finishing up of
[29:18] resurrection
[29:20] why wouldn't they
[29:23] you know they studied the word that's
[29:25] right
[29:27] the pharisees you say well they got a
[29:28] great revelation about the resurrection
[29:31] well could it be that the pharisees
[29:35] had a little bit understanding of what
[29:36] job was talking about
[29:38] of a resurrection
[29:41] you know more than just a general
[29:45] resurrection and maybe it was the
[29:48] sadducees
[29:50] disbelieved in one of these days there
[29:52] was going to be a resurrection
[29:55] because they were quick to use that in
[29:58] their
[29:59] talking to jesus because
[30:02] remember the sadducees and the things
[30:04] they were quick to say
[30:05] oh now you know this man died his wife
[30:09] married again and they died and he met
[30:11] again and
[30:12] they died and said now in the
[30:14] resurrection said uh
[30:17] who's gonna be whose wife and husband
[30:20] you know
[30:23] i'm just telling you what i believe all
[30:26] right
[30:26] i believe all mankind believes in a
[30:29] final
[30:30] resurrection or something because
[30:33] why would you think about
[30:37] you know that when this ends what's done
[30:43] you know why why would anybody think
[30:45] that just because they die
[30:49] you know but that's the end
[30:52] well then why if that's the end why
[30:55] were some concerned and spoke of
[30:58] judgments
[31:00] throughout the world
[31:05] some spoke of condemnation right
[31:08] this resurrection spoke over the just
[31:12] there's resurrection spoke of in the
[31:14] bible of the of life
[31:17] there's a resurrection of damnation
[31:20] spoken up in the bible
[31:23] and see this i didn't choose to try to
[31:25] bring everything i just want you to
[31:27] think about
[31:31] a person said well well all i am i'll
[31:34] just die
[31:35] and i'm gone now you looking between the
[31:39] eyes and you say do you really believe
[31:40] that
[31:43] you know well
[31:47] why are you making preparations to live
[31:52] you know what is what our guys are over
[31:55] with
[31:56] you see that's just carnality of mankind
[31:58] thinking
[32:00] because if you think about that you are
[32:02] a human being
[32:06] no matter who it is hedonistics or
[32:09] whatever you know anybody
[32:12] agnostics idiots or whatever
[32:17] you think about it everybody has a
[32:21] hope within them right
[32:25] of something after this world
[32:30] see because why would you want to be a
[32:33] good person
[32:38] because if you die what's the need of
[32:39] somebody writing on an obituary what
[32:42] good is an obituary going to be
[32:43] sister gail that they're right sister
[32:45] gayle addison she gave a lot of money to
[32:47] this and
[32:48] you're dead and gone you don't you don't
[32:50] exist if that's what you believe
[32:53] me to everybody
[32:57] like the prophet said and you know his
[33:00] words
[33:01] he said everybody believes in a god
[33:04] no matter what they say
[33:08] they believe in a god of some form
[33:11] you know now that they're proving that
[33:13] the big bang theory is more
[33:15] conclusive they proved it was in the
[33:17] paper just the other day
[33:18] they proved it with their their
[33:20] abilities now and can tell you the world
[33:22] how old it is and everything
[33:24] they believe in a big bang theory and
[33:26] they believe that this
[33:27] whole universe that we're sitting in was
[33:29] no bigger than a
[33:30] fingernail on your finger
[33:36] and a lot of it's in the fingernail but
[33:39] you know you just read what they're
[33:40] saying but then you you have to analyze
[33:42] what they're saying
[33:44] that they're not talking about it was
[33:45] that small that was talking about it
[33:46] just
[33:47] comparison to what all the other stuff
[33:49] is
[33:50] but now listen i believe then that
[33:54] all believed in a resurrection of some
[33:57] form
[33:58] a time after this or a lie for something
[34:02] because that's the soul of man
[34:06] the soul of man believes in some form of
[34:09] a god
[34:13] if not they believe in their own self
[34:16] that they're god
[34:18] but that's still you know getting it to
[34:19] right all right
[34:21] see that i said job job was looking for
[34:25] a resurrection
[34:26] readiness read his writings earth before
[34:28] he gets over to saying i know my
[34:29] redeemer
[34:31] he's talking about a day coming a
[34:35] judgment or something or
[34:36] whatever but then when he saw
[34:39] i know see that brought down that meant
[34:42] that
[34:43] a person began to be talking about now
[34:46] if you don't get nothing out of message
[34:47] today you get one thing
[34:49] the resurrection is not a date a time a
[34:52] season or thought or idea
[34:54] or concept right the resurrection is a
[34:56] person amen
[34:58] all right now that's the only way you
[35:01] can explain
[35:02] how that he gets over in revelation here
[35:04] and it caused the millennium
[35:06] the first resurrection
[35:10] if you don't get it down as a person
[35:12] then you're missing it that's right
[35:14] so remember this morning brother around
[35:15] was talking about the millennium right
[35:17] around said the millennium
[35:18] jesus came with the millennium in him
[35:21] amen
[35:23] right you don't have to wait
[35:27] it was in him all right the resurrection
[35:30] was in him yes
[35:33] now follow that point i want to go slow
[35:35] but i'm just laying down a little bit
[35:36] ahead of you to think about
[35:39] so think about everybody believing in
[35:41] the resurrection
[35:43] read in a minute where the jews brothers
[35:45] have believed in a general resurrection
[35:50] all mankind as i said is believes that
[35:52] someday
[35:54] there will be something about something
[35:55] that'll happen that we'll raise and
[35:57] we'll have to give an account
[35:59] that's within the hearts and the
[36:00] thoughts of mankind all right
[36:03] now but we read here in the scripture
[36:08] that blessed is he that have part in
[36:10] there or is a partaker
[36:13] of the first resurrection
[36:17] because then he will have no part in the
[36:20] second resurrection
[36:26] see then the second resurrection is
[36:29] resurrection of all mankind
[36:32] going to the water on judgment
[36:35] right yes that is the second
[36:37] resurrection yes
[36:38] okay now blessed and holy is he that
[36:41] have part in the first
[36:44] because that way he'll have no part in
[36:46] the second
[36:49] that's what job began to see
[36:53] it was opening to him
[36:56] and he saw something about the
[36:59] resurrection
[37:02] and then he spoke he said and i'll see
[37:05] him for myself
[37:06] right right something personal
[37:09] all right now
[37:12] see the second resurrection is the dead
[37:16] going to the white throne judgment
[37:20] and that's what we ended up talking
[37:22] about satan this morning
[37:24] it needs to be loose for a little season
[37:27] what that consists of i don't know i've
[37:29] never heard the prophet explain how long
[37:30] that was
[37:32] it just said for a little season i do
[37:34] know what he said about it he said he'd
[37:36] be loosed
[37:38] together his subjects
[37:43] doesn't mean that he'll be loose to
[37:45] where he can raise the dead
[37:46] no the prophet wouldn't talk about that
[37:48] because satan can't do it
[37:50] but he would be loosed together as
[37:52] subjects because when the resurrection
[37:54] starts transpiring
[37:55] as i was saying this morning that god
[37:58] brings all mankind up in a resurrection
[38:00] satan said hey man i got it
[38:04] i wasn't able to control and do because
[38:07] i only had a
[38:08] few at my disposal
[38:11] you know or my ability in life but this
[38:14] mass
[38:14] multitude that is coming up
[38:18] all i got to do is get them on my side
[38:21] and you know out of that group that will
[38:23] be coming up a lot of them will be on
[38:25] his side
[38:27] but we read this morning he said his
[38:29] subjects was in hell
[38:33] he said well wait a minute now hell's
[38:34] not
[38:38] there's a hell right now but it's not a
[38:39] burning hell it's not this kind of hell
[38:41] or that time
[38:43] it's just a falling but it's the word
[38:45] hell because the word hell is
[38:47] hades show gahanna that refers to the
[38:49] grave it can refer to
[38:51] positional places etc now
[38:58] but when i'll get back and read it in a
[39:00] minute i want to quote it
[39:02] when martha said
[39:05] about lazarus
[39:08] she said he shall rise
[39:12] in the resurrection at the last days
[39:16] that's john 11 24.
[39:20] see she believed
[39:24] she believed
[39:28] that lazarus was going to raise one day
[39:31] but at that time their understanding was
[39:34] not even to the basis maybe of
[39:36] job so they were still just looking for
[39:40] a
[39:40] natural resurrection for a time that all
[39:44] would raise
[39:46] you know and they had assumed probably
[39:48] there'd have to be some form of
[39:50] judgments or whatever
[39:51] they would have to be answer
[39:55] because that's just the part of mankind
[39:56] that's the soul of mankind
[39:59] you know see he longs to to find his
[40:02] maker
[40:04] all right there's job lord said what joe
[40:07] wanted was
[40:08] for some man to be able to come that
[40:11] would take the hand of god
[40:13] and take his hand and pull them together
[40:17] well you know then he seen him
[40:21] he saw a man that would come and do that
[40:23] not physically maybe seeing him there he
[40:26] saw
[40:26] through revelation and he spoke by
[40:30] inspiration i know
[40:31] that my redeemer liveth all right now
[40:35] so here's martha in that same
[40:38] unregenerated position but yet
[40:41] knowing that up until this time maybe
[40:43] jesus hadn't spoke a lot about the
[40:44] resurrection
[40:46] other than thoughts and ideas that had
[40:49] been said and the pharisees had argued
[40:51] backwards and forth
[40:52] because they were arguing that point
[40:54] they were smart enough to
[40:56] say well you know whose wife will this
[40:58] be in the resurrections etc
[41:00] because all of those were thoughts and
[41:01] ideas and jesus had made
[41:03] maybe a lot of statements that they
[41:06] begin to think a lot but still she
[41:08] didn't see he was the resurrection right
[41:11] now you understand what i'm getting at
[41:12] yes she was still thinking about
[41:15] something else
[41:16] huh so they had all of that in mind
[41:21] and brother rather said
[41:24] all jews will believe in the
[41:26] resurrection let's look at this one
[41:30] go ahead brother number one
[41:34] this is believe us now this 1957
[41:38] 16 82
[41:41] notice he said now i want you to read
[41:43] this real careful with me
[41:45] there's many of these but i chose this
[41:47] one because of the wording
[41:49] so thy brother shall rise again
[41:54] now let's straighten him up
[41:58] my brother shall rise again
[42:01] watch the old prophetic powers now
[42:03] coming right together
[42:06] the right place the right person
[42:10] the right time
[42:14] now watch it read with me
[42:19] she said i know my brother shall rise
[42:22] again
[42:25] you know he was waiting on somebody to
[42:27] say that
[42:31] uh we'll just read it and see where he
[42:33] was or not watch him
[42:35] watch the old prophetic powers now
[42:37] coming right together
[42:40] the right place
[42:43] lazarus was dead that's right
[42:46] they were in front of the tomb
[42:50] the right person martha
[42:54] right was the one to say it right
[42:58] the right time
[43:02] you remember the story he had been on
[43:04] going out away and they sent him word
[43:06] that lazarus
[43:08] was sick and he just kept going yeah
[43:12] finally he turns to go back and someone
[43:13] says well yeah
[43:15] you know he said listen lazarus is dead
[43:19] i'm gonna go raise him the
[43:23] right time right person right pla
[43:25] everything's gonna be right
[43:27] so when she said my brother's dead
[43:30] and in the grave
[43:34] see what our thoughts is and he just
[43:35] goes out there and says i'm on my way
[43:37] back i'm gonna raise the dead
[43:40] all right well what about mankind
[43:43] getting involved my brother is dead
[43:46] and in the grave but you
[43:50] if you'd have been here
[43:54] he wouldn't have died
[43:57] see she's beginning to see something
[44:01] she's beginning to see the resurrection
[44:04] all right but even now
[44:09] whatever you ask him god will do it she
[44:12] had her confidence
[44:14] in him yes right
[44:18] she believed that god had heard before
[44:20] and done that so watch what
[44:22] that touched you
[44:25] read it that touched you
[44:30] that touched him faith
[44:33] never had been done before
[44:38] faith my brother shall rise again
[44:46] he said yea lord he will rise in the
[44:49] last days
[44:53] them jews believe in the general
[44:55] resurrection
[44:58] oh he will rise again
[45:01] he's a good boy he'll raise in the last
[45:04] days i know
[45:06] then he goes down and makes his
[45:08] statement done
[45:10] he said i am the resurrection
[45:16] now
[45:19] i'd like to explain things to detail to
[45:21] work that it'd be unquestionable by
[45:24] people who would be sarcastic
[45:28] so now
[45:31] was that body standing there at the
[45:33] resurrection
[45:41] i like a few things it keeps you awake
[45:44] for one time but comes
[45:50] with that body standing there was at the
[45:52] resurrection
[45:54] so was he saying you know pointing out
[46:00] the resurrection standing here
[46:03] or what did he say he said
[46:07] i am
[46:11] the resurrection
[46:14] now who's the resurrection
[46:19] yeah that's right
[46:23] okay remember
[46:26] do we believe the prophet yes that's
[46:29] right he said jesus could do nothing
[46:31] until the father showed him
[46:36] but that statement he came out of him
[46:37] lips
[46:39] he had told the others that he was dead
[46:44] but he was going to raise him
[46:49] because he believed it but when he got
[46:51] to that place
[46:53] she can't touch him
[46:58] she touched him when he said it never
[47:01] been done before
[47:06] she touched him when she said if you
[47:08] hadn't been here
[47:11] my brother wouldn't have died
[47:14] but nevertheless
[47:18] no matter what he's dead
[47:22] but said whatever you say
[47:25] we know what happened when sister had
[47:26] her out brother brown was explaining
[47:29] those things and she said run around
[47:31] that ain't nothing but the truth
[47:32] amen that's right god said give her what
[47:36] she asked for
[47:41] wasn't that the way it was when the
[47:42] little woman you know said yeah lord
[47:46] you're right that's dogs ain't worth
[47:48] nothing but we eat the crumbs
[47:50] from the master's table he turned around
[47:54] and
[47:54] give her what she asked for now are you
[47:58] following me
[48:00] the resurrection is a person right amen
[48:09] when he said i am the resurrection that
[48:12] was the same
[48:12] i am that spoke to moses from the
[48:16] burning bush
[48:22] when jesus would say i am that i am
[48:25] right so he didn't say that yes he did
[48:31] he was letting them know
[48:35] that within that framework
[48:38] the framework wasn't the resurrection
[48:40] right but within that framework
[48:43] was the god of glory amen
[48:48] it doesn't matter how much dead you've
[48:50] heard the prophet say it
[48:51] if he hadn't said lazarus inspect this
[48:55] specified to one person
[48:58] there would have been a resurrection
[49:04] so he said lazarus that's right
[49:09] because that was the only one who's
[49:10] going to come forth at that time
[49:14] but they said i am the resurrection
[49:20] now paul says in romans 8 and 11 that
[49:23] if the spirit of him that raised up
[49:28] jesus
[49:31] now it's specific it's not saying it the
[49:33] way you read
[49:35] it's specific in what it's saying it's
[49:37] the spirit of him who
[49:39] i am who raised jesus
[49:46] come on oh moses goes down there to
[49:50] egypt and
[49:51] go pharaoh he said by the way who's your
[49:55] god
[49:57] he said well i met him out there burning
[50:01] bush
[50:04] who's gonna take these people out he
[50:05] said i am
[50:09] well it's so close until the words out
[50:11] of his mouth
[50:13] was the dust saith the lord but the
[50:16] flesh was just a human being
[50:23] see that man that flesh man to the quote
[50:26] of
[50:26] the prophet he said he couldn't do
[50:29] anything to the father show me
[50:35] i don't make two people right
[50:40] don't make one going to tell him nothing
[50:41] what to do
[50:43] but he said i am the resurrection amen
[50:47] he said if the spirit of him that raised
[50:52] jesus from the dead
[50:55] what dwell in you he that raised up
[50:58] christ from the dead shall
[51:00] also raise or quicken your mortal bodies
[51:04] by the spirit that dwelleth in him
[51:05] the reason it says quickly
[51:09] instead of saying well raise because he
[51:12] then you would just have everything
[51:13] based on the resurrection
[51:14] but it says quicken it uses another word
[51:17] from the term
[51:18] resurrection it says quicken
[51:21] because see the day you receive the new
[51:23] birth that's right
[51:25] they don't resurrect you away
[51:29] it raises you up into heavenly places
[51:32] right a resurrection takes place right
[51:36] and it'll quicken your body amen you
[51:39] know
[51:39] brings your body under subjection so you
[51:42] see why
[51:42] there would be two words used instead of
[51:45] saying
[51:46] raised they would say quicken
[51:49] because it's something taking place that
[51:51] goes on besides just being raised that's
[51:54] what i want you to see about this
[51:55] resurrection
[51:57] amen and then you'll understand why it
[51:59] says that the millennium
[52:01] literally it says it there was written
[52:03] is the first resurrection
[52:10] but you see where where's that part of
[52:12] that resurrection
[52:15] that's right put a brother in a message
[52:17] called fades paragraph one
[52:19] he says you got your resurrection inside
[52:21] of you
[52:22] that's right your resurrection lays
[52:25] inside of you in your spirit
[52:26] that's right amen
[52:31] you're not just your spirit part
[52:32] remember right
[52:35] amen spirit there is soul right that's
[52:38] right
[52:38] amen okay me and our spirit
[52:42] we need it we definitely need a
[52:45] resurrection
[52:46] in our spirit but that's one of those
[52:49] things we have to deal with
[52:50] because remember back there in the early
[52:52] ministry
[52:54] then went out on the air i know i have
[52:55] to say it because i don't made a
[52:56] statement there
[52:57] what's he talking about right in the
[53:00] early ministry brother brown was taught
[53:02] what body soul spirit
[53:05] right not in every case but that's the
[53:07] basis of his teaching
[53:09] then after the 62 of the greatest battle
[53:11] ever fought from then on he would say
[53:13] body
[53:14] spirit soul so back in his early
[53:17] ministry of the 61 here
[53:19] and coming on up he would still be
[53:22] talking about the second realm of
[53:24] mankind
[53:26] as spirit yeah
[53:29] see here he's using spirit lays inside
[53:31] in your spirit
[53:34] well i'll agree to one thing
[53:37] if i never get what's in my soul out
[53:39] into my spirit it's gonna raise
[53:41] amen i mean that's that's that's what
[53:44] we're doing
[53:45] right right you remember the wife has
[53:47] made herself ready
[53:49] all right
[53:53] just getting this parts about the
[53:55] resurrection look at number
[53:57] five they didn't jump so far ahead of me
[53:59] today
[54:04] this is program 110 of the deity of
[54:06] jesus christ 49 12 25
[54:09] the same power of christ that was hung
[54:11] on the calvary's cross
[54:14] the same god that raised him up on the
[54:16] day of the resurrection
[54:18] is in you now what
[54:21] you that's got the holy ghost didn't see
[54:23] everybody
[54:24] you just got the holy ghost no don't you
[54:26] love him yes
[54:27] does he hear his voice yes you that's
[54:29] not the holy ghost
[54:31] so what is the resurrection right
[54:36] it's the holy ghost amen
[54:40] right because that's the spirit of god
[54:42] brethren you that's
[54:44] i am that's come to live in you amen
[54:48] amen now the i am lived in him the i am
[54:50] raised him
[54:52] all right then i am is the one that come
[54:53] on the death pentecost in the baptism of
[54:55] the holy ghost
[54:56] right that's right and that puts that
[54:59] same god inside of us
[55:01] right amen
[55:08] see then jesus would be the first one
[55:10] that could speak of
[55:11] in a personal extent job would be
[55:14] prophesying
[55:15] of seeing it in the future
[55:20] and he said i know let my redeemer live
[55:23] within the last days
[55:27] now where do you want to put that and
[55:28] where he was raised up when jesus came
[55:31] up or where you want to put it in the
[55:32] last days run around place it both
[55:33] places go ahead do what y'all do
[55:36] but it's still the point job said i'll
[55:38] see him for myself
[55:41] he was looking out there but jesus
[55:43] wasn't looking out there
[55:44] jesus didn't stand there and say i'll
[55:46] pray the father
[55:48] now now it sounds pretty good what you
[55:50] said now martha
[55:51] but let me pray a little while and we'll
[55:54] see what god says
[55:57] you didn't say that my brother around
[56:01] says you'll see sometimes jesus is
[56:02] speaking
[56:03] but says sometimes god is speaking right
[56:05] well you know that's not
[56:07] far off to you and i i mean sometimes
[56:11] every once while he might speak a little
[56:12] bit there ain't no gun lives
[56:14] most of the time it's me elaborating but
[56:16] still you got to get through that
[56:19] if it's too it's the truth it'd be good
[56:20] blabbering
[56:22] but now listen that same
[56:26] i am
[56:30] is now in you by the new birth right
[56:33] if you believe in one true living god
[56:35] amen by the baptism of the holy ghost
[56:38] right to all who have the baptism of the
[56:40] holy ghost
[56:44] are already in the first resurrection
[56:47] not say in the first resurrection the
[56:50] resurrection's already in them
[56:53] because the resurrection was inside of
[56:55] that flesh that was standing down right
[56:58] right right the man we looked at because
[57:01] jesus inside of there was the
[57:02] resurrection right
[57:05] he had no reference that he himself
[57:07] could do anything that's right
[57:09] his reference was to the one that's
[57:10] inside paul had no reference and he
[57:12] could do anything
[57:13] but if the spirit that raised up
[57:17] jesus dwell in you
[57:20] they're gonna raise up your body too
[57:22] amen all right
[57:24] now i'm trying to get a point to you to
[57:29] think about
[57:35] that what is that
[57:39] first resurrection
[57:44] you know
[57:47] it's not a time or a date
[57:51] but it's a person that's right
[57:55] and that person is almighty god
[57:58] god is the only one who can raise the
[57:59] dead that's why jesus would say i can do
[58:02] nothing to my father shows me
[58:05] because in his place he could do nothing
[58:07] he was a human part of flesh
[58:10] but inside of there was almighty god
[58:13] see and once that's changed and goes
[58:16] forth in the glory that you can't
[58:17] separate it we're not going to get up
[58:19] there one of these days
[58:20] and find jesus over here and god over
[58:22] here to fill her fire over here
[58:23] whole bunch of things no no that god may
[58:25] be all
[58:27] in all right as i bring that wednesday
[58:30] night it'll be in you and i
[58:31] am amen yeah all in all the king of
[58:34] kings and lord of lords
[58:36] all right
[58:39] so they asked brother brown a question
[58:42] go ahead number six they asked him a
[58:44] question
[58:47] and the question was about the you know
[58:51] if a person must have the holy ghost to
[58:53] be
[58:54] how the holy ghost to be converted and
[58:56] to go in the rapture
[58:57] what would be the state of children that
[58:59] have died before the years of
[59:00] accountability now i'm not trying i'm
[59:02] not trying to prove
[59:04] any point i'm trying to just read down
[59:05] to to the lies
[59:09] he said i can't tell you that he said
[59:11] there's no scripture in my lesson if i
[59:13] can find
[59:14] anywhere so he just leaving it but
[59:17] i can express my thoughts and it'll
[59:20] strengthen you that believe in grace
[59:23] the person wants to know
[59:27] what resurrection what will happen to a
[59:29] baby
[59:30] that he has to have the holy ghost in
[59:32] order to go in the rapture
[59:34] as i have said that's right
[59:38] that's right that's according to the
[59:40] bible
[59:43] that's the teaching of the scripture not
[59:45] not to
[59:46] go in heaven now see he said not to go
[59:48] in heaven
[59:50] you don't have to have the holy ghost to
[59:51] go in heaven
[59:54] all right because the holy ghost filled
[59:56] people is the first
[59:58] resurrection that's the main point i
[1:00:02] want you to get to
[1:00:03] and you'll live and you won't have
[1:00:04] anything to do in the second
[1:00:05] resurrection thing that's the main point
[1:00:07] i want you to get to
[1:00:08] but we do know that all babies go to
[1:00:10] heaven
[1:00:13] so don't try to explain that or spend no
[1:00:15] time on it all babies going to help
[1:00:17] going to heaven
[1:00:19] but if you're going into change and
[1:00:20] you've got a baby why can't you believe
[1:00:22] that baby
[1:00:23] will be changing going to rapture with
[1:00:25] you who's going to take care of it
[1:00:27] until the time comes or whatever and i'm
[1:00:29] just flat carnal on that
[1:00:32] you mean god's going to take the man the
[1:00:34] father out leave the baby later before
[1:00:36] things starve to death
[1:00:37] i'll take it to heaven no
[1:00:42] you might ought to remember that when
[1:00:46] brother brown saw sharon rose
[1:00:48] she was not a baby anymore that's right
[1:00:52] she was a young lady and could tell him
[1:00:56] what was going to take place
[1:00:58] all right not trying to get over that
[1:01:01] part because that's a doctrine in itself
[1:01:04] but to get on to the point of
[1:01:07] the holy ghostbuild people it's the
[1:01:10] first resurrection
[1:01:13] all right now holy ghost field if jesus
[1:01:16] i'm laying down it's a thought now what
[1:01:19] if jesus says i am the resurrection
[1:01:24] right then we believe that those who
[1:01:27] have the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:01:30] that the resurrection is inside of you
[1:01:34] by the new birth making you a part of
[1:01:37] the resurrection because see that was
[1:01:39] the reason jesus had to die
[1:01:42] now he could stand here on the earth
[1:01:47] and he had the ability now
[1:01:51] listen to my point for a minute when
[1:01:54] jesus was here on earth he had the
[1:01:55] ability to raise the dead
[1:01:58] he proved it because he done it all
[1:02:01] right
[1:02:03] he said the son of man have power to
[1:02:05] even forgive sins
[1:02:08] why because it was god in him all right
[1:02:12] now when
[1:02:15] when jesus stood there
[1:02:20] with martha there was a connection
[1:02:23] between the i
[1:02:24] am and the martha
[1:02:28] listen with me and thing that would
[1:02:31] bring
[1:02:32] lazarus from the grave so he was waiting
[1:02:35] on her to say it
[1:02:39] he just didn't come back holly lazarus
[1:02:40] come on out
[1:02:43] she had to say what she had to say
[1:02:47] to worry that it would trigger to him
[1:02:49] and touch him
[1:02:50] and then when it did then he would call
[1:02:52] the dead
[1:02:54] all right now if we believe he was
[1:02:58] almighty god
[1:03:00] now listen with me for a minute please
[1:03:04] if we believe that he was almighty god
[1:03:06] then
[1:03:07] he had the ability to raise the dead
[1:03:09] before he raised ladder
[1:03:14] right
[1:03:17] so had it not been that he was
[1:03:20] connecting the human elements of martha
[1:03:22] back with it on the spoken word
[1:03:24] he could have just walked up to the
[1:03:26] ladder of grace and ladder come forward
[1:03:30] it was god right
[1:03:34] now did god prove
[1:03:40] his point of who the resurrection was
[1:03:43] and it's a person
[1:03:46] by raising lazarus
[1:03:50] are you listening yes or was it more
[1:03:53] definitely proved
[1:03:56] when he raised up himself
[1:04:02] he said well it was all the same thing
[1:04:04] okay all right
[1:04:06] but this is my thinking it's just odd
[1:04:08] you know
[1:04:10] i'm glad everybody don't think like i do
[1:04:14] my point is that he could have raised
[1:04:18] the dead
[1:04:22] he raised a little boy from damn
[1:04:26] you know i didn't look that up to see
[1:04:28] where it was before he raised lazarus or
[1:04:30] not but i wasn't interested
[1:04:33] my point is that he could raise the dead
[1:04:37] but when he raised a little boy from
[1:04:39] nine he never declared
[1:04:41] i am the resurrection
[1:04:46] he simply raised the dead
[1:04:50] because he had that ability he was god
[1:04:54] but when it comes to martha she got
[1:04:57] involved
[1:04:58] he got involved he done told him he was
[1:05:01] going to go raise him
[1:05:06] but had she not said that
[1:05:09] it would have been purely like the rest
[1:05:11] of the resurrection
[1:05:13] but this resurrection shows you that i
[1:05:16] am
[1:05:17] right right all right now follow me i
[1:05:20] know it'll take a little thinking right
[1:05:21] here
[1:05:24] had he not said to her i am the
[1:05:27] resurrection
[1:05:29] then you wouldn't have been able to go
[1:05:30] to the book of revelation and say
[1:05:33] that sounds like he says the millennium
[1:05:35] is the resurrection
[1:05:41] maybe you don't need that or don't think
[1:05:42] like that but to me it's very important
[1:05:47] but by him saying i am
[1:05:50] the resurrection
[1:05:54] he was not looking for a future event or
[1:05:57] a thought
[1:05:58] or an idea he was talking about right
[1:06:00] where he was right then
[1:06:02] and that's what martha began to catch
[1:06:05] you know what lazarus raised
[1:06:08] but you know what one day that same i
[1:06:12] am raised that same body
[1:06:16] out of the grave that's right sugar was
[1:06:20] the summing up
[1:06:23] of him being the first resurrection
[1:06:29] you understand me he was the first
[1:06:32] resurrection
[1:06:34] right he proved it by raising
[1:06:38] paul said if that same god that same
[1:06:40] spiritually in your eraser you do
[1:06:42] to raise you up amen
[1:06:46] see my whole point is putting it on
[1:06:48] whether or not you can see who that was
[1:06:50] standing there right
[1:06:51] now what he's done
[1:06:55] he could have raised the dead he proved
[1:06:57] it he did raise the dead
[1:07:01] but never a man
[1:07:05] could make the statement i am the
[1:07:12] resurrection
[1:07:14] turned around and proved it be raised
[1:07:15] the man from the dead
[1:07:19] but brought it into final proof by
[1:07:22] raising up his
[1:07:23] own body you agree
[1:07:26] all right man see really when you say it
[1:07:29] then
[1:07:30] when the when jesus raised from the dead
[1:07:32] there's your first resurrection right
[1:07:35] you understand what i mean that's the
[1:07:37] first resurrection now that nobody had
[1:07:39] been raised from the dead before then
[1:07:42] you remember when uh elisha had died and
[1:07:46] buried him in the tomb and you know
[1:07:49] and they was carrying a man through
[1:07:51] there you know and they he was dead and
[1:07:54] they're trying to get him back home you
[1:07:55] know and the enemy come up so they just
[1:07:58] throw him over into the tomb where
[1:08:00] elisha had been buried and they thought
[1:08:02] we'll come back and get him
[1:08:05] well you know what he just jumped alive
[1:08:09] right
[1:08:11] see resurrections that come
[1:08:17] right who was it elijah
[1:08:22] the little woman had the boy did he die
[1:08:26] he went laid over him and prayed and
[1:08:29] prayed
[1:08:31] you know what little boy come back alive
[1:08:34] see they had been the dead rays before
[1:08:36] jesus came
[1:08:41] but listen to my point
[1:08:45] the deads that were raised before jesus
[1:08:47] was
[1:08:48] talking that were physical people
[1:08:51] that had simply died and brought right
[1:08:54] back so
[1:08:55] it was a resurrection but not a
[1:08:57] resurrection from going into the grave
[1:09:00] and coming out but when he got to martha
[1:09:07] he said
[1:09:08] i am the resurrection i'm the one that
[1:09:11] brought
[1:09:12] the man to life back there with elisha
[1:09:15] i'm the one that
[1:09:18] you know elijah laid on the little boy
[1:09:20] i'm the one that's done that
[1:09:22] there's never been any dead race i've
[1:09:24] done it
[1:09:28] and she said you're right
[1:09:32] he said but he's got to be brought a
[1:09:34] little bit closer now
[1:09:38] i am the resurrection
[1:09:41] destroy this body now listen is the man
[1:09:45] still talking
[1:09:48] is the bible still being written destroy
[1:09:51] this body
[1:09:52] and in three days i'll raise it up
[1:09:55] right right
[1:09:59] the others were just dead and raised
[1:10:01] back a few hours or
[1:10:03] half a day or something
[1:10:06] maybe a matter of minutes
[1:10:10] but here's one that said just go ahead
[1:10:12] and kill me
[1:10:17] what was it the surety when
[1:10:20] when he raised lazarus
[1:10:24] of the first resurrection who he was or
[1:10:26] was it the surety when the day he raised
[1:10:28] himself
[1:10:32] right are you getting it i'm just trying
[1:10:34] to make things more positive
[1:10:35] more positive more positive more
[1:10:37] positive in the talk
[1:10:39] don't even have a note so i forgot all
[1:10:42] that
[1:10:46] but then by doing that
[1:10:51] there were many people
[1:10:55] in the new testament
[1:11:00] that was raised from the dead right
[1:11:05] the apostles in many cases
[1:11:09] raised the dead you remember the man
[1:11:12] falling out the window the boy and
[1:11:14] dying with paul because he preached
[1:11:16] along
[1:11:17] man i'm glad we don't sit in windows
[1:11:20] around here
[1:11:27] i'll wake you up
[1:11:32] but paul went down and prayed for the
[1:11:34] man that he was raised in the dead
[1:11:38] there's been many down through there
[1:11:42] that raised the dead right now none of
[1:11:45] them
[1:11:47] publicly stated i am the resurrection
[1:11:51] right that's right look at me i raised
[1:11:54] the dead brother i said people talk like
[1:11:55] that you know there's something wrong
[1:11:56] with him
[1:11:58] he said if there's anything done god
[1:12:00] does it that's right
[1:12:02] amen
[1:12:06] the dead has been raised among us
[1:12:10] but we still ain't got the i am right
[1:12:17] there you see we live
[1:12:21] we believe it i believe it too and i've
[1:12:23] seen it experienced
[1:12:25] i don't have to worry about that see the
[1:12:27] man of the eyes are rolled back but when
[1:12:29] i called his name randall
[1:12:31] with a loud tone i mean why would i do
[1:12:33] that
[1:12:34] the man was letting her wait said he's
[1:12:35] gone daddy
[1:12:38] well i just said real
[1:12:42] he opened his eyes and looked up he said
[1:12:44] yeah
[1:12:47] well whether he was dead or unconscious
[1:12:49] i ain't worried about it
[1:12:51] i just tell him what happened
[1:12:55] but you see we're still missing the i am
[1:12:57] amen
[1:12:58] because if that man was raised in the
[1:13:00] dead that's right
[1:13:01] it wouldn't mean
[1:13:06] it wasn't my voice
[1:13:11] there's been a lot of people that been
[1:13:16] raised
[1:13:18] but you still how can you come over to
[1:13:22] the book of revelations
[1:13:25] and say that and it sounds exactly like
[1:13:28] that you say in the millennium as a
[1:13:29] resurrection
[1:13:30] first resurrection
[1:13:34] you've got to admit the first
[1:13:35] resurrection was 2 000 years ago
[1:13:41] right that was the first resurrection
[1:13:44] you got to admit that he raised
[1:13:48] just think about it right
[1:13:54] went up and come back imparting his life
[1:13:57] and bringing the resurrection inside of
[1:14:00] us
[1:14:00] yeah that's right that's it right in
[1:14:03] your word
[1:14:04] amen so the resurrection is inside of
[1:14:06] you amen
[1:14:10] now but still can we say i am the
[1:14:14] resurrection
[1:14:17] yeah when the lord tells me
[1:14:20] i admit that openly first number one
[1:14:25] anybody with any sense and know for sure
[1:14:26] that has to be him doing it
[1:14:29] but what i'm saying why would he get
[1:14:32] over the book of revelations
[1:14:35] and he'd say would the rest of the dead
[1:14:38] live not again
[1:14:39] until the thousand years were finished
[1:14:42] this is
[1:14:43] the first resurrection all right
[1:14:47] same thing there's likely never been one
[1:14:53] because that's the first all right
[1:14:56] and he's talking about the millennium
[1:14:58] come on
[1:14:59] you know we're at least speaking about
[1:15:02] the money let me put it that way
[1:15:05] millennium that's not the resurrection
[1:15:08] all right
[1:15:10] right
[1:15:13] come on the millennium is not the first
[1:15:15] resurrection
[1:15:17] there's been many resurrections and
[1:15:20] there was one resurrection that raised
[1:15:22] up
[1:15:23] that he could pay the price for you and
[1:15:24] i right
[1:15:29] and he was the first resurrector
[1:15:34] he puts that resurrection inside of you
[1:15:36] come
[1:15:40] see when you come into the millennium
[1:15:45] you are already restored body spirit
[1:15:48] control
[1:15:50] right
[1:15:52] that is the first resurrection right
[1:15:56] no no no brother dale that would have to
[1:15:58] be the second one no it
[1:16:01] specifically states the next verse
[1:16:06] he didn't have heart in the first
[1:16:07] resurrection there won't be no second
[1:16:09] resurrection
[1:16:10] right what is that saying if we
[1:16:14] now wait and i'll twist it all we do if
[1:16:16] you you
[1:16:17] live twice you die once lived twice from
[1:16:20] houses
[1:16:20] nobody got it back years ago but simply
[1:16:23] means that
[1:16:25] here i am if i die to myself
[1:16:28] i don't have to die that's right i don't
[1:16:31] have to die
[1:16:32] that's why because somebody died for me
[1:16:35] right
[1:16:36] see here we are now looking at the
[1:16:38] millennium yes
[1:16:42] but yet when we see the millennial rain
[1:16:45] a thousand years
[1:16:46] we can stand there and say look
[1:16:49] this is the completion
[1:16:53] of the first resurrection
[1:16:58] over which the second death can have no
[1:17:02] park
[1:17:03] right because we won't die
[1:17:10] are you listening you never thought
[1:17:11] about that scripture it gets over there
[1:17:13] and it says
[1:17:15] talks about a thousand years and it's
[1:17:16] also just like a thousand years as a
[1:17:18] resurrect
[1:17:18] first resurrection well a thousand years
[1:17:21] is not the first president
[1:17:25] the thousand years is the promise of god
[1:17:27] that somebody's going to live that
[1:17:29] thousand years
[1:17:30] which is his word
[1:17:39] when you and i get to that place we've
[1:17:42] already went through it like this past
[1:17:44] wednesday night
[1:17:47] when we get to that place it will be
[1:17:50] king of kings and lord of lords
[1:17:54] right and where the scripture says that
[1:17:56] all that god may be all
[1:17:58] in all i'll show you where he said
[1:18:00] that's the millennial rhyme
[1:18:03] but then it goes on because there's
[1:18:05] something left that the future home has
[1:18:07] a
[1:18:08] meaning of the all in all all
[1:18:12] in all you remember wednesday
[1:18:16] when it comes to the book of revelation
[1:18:17] 19th chapter and that's riding back with
[1:18:19] him in the millennium
[1:18:20] you can't tell no difference in us in
[1:18:21] him
[1:18:24] my culture had already been joined
[1:18:27] see that's the 19th chapter
[1:18:31] right now we're in the 20th chapter
[1:18:37] looking back to where we made that ride
[1:18:40] and we're in the millennium
[1:18:45] ruling and reigning with him
[1:18:50] and
[1:18:53] would it be a problem for us to say
[1:18:57] do you agree with this so i'll say it
[1:18:58] first no problem to say the resurrection
[1:19:01] is inside of us isn't it
[1:19:05] but what about the end that we can say
[1:19:08] the resurrection has taken place
[1:19:11] come on
[1:19:14] those are going to live in the
[1:19:15] millennial reign
[1:19:20] whether it be bribe whether it be israel
[1:19:23] as a nation
[1:19:25] whether it be 144 000 then the two
[1:19:28] witnesses
[1:19:29] or whether it be the fifth sealed jew
[1:19:33] they're going to be in the millennium
[1:19:39] right
[1:19:42] and remember that's before the white
[1:19:44] throne so those in the millennium don't
[1:19:46] have to go to the white room
[1:19:51] so then the first resurrection
[1:19:57] comes to completion in the millennial
[1:19:59] reign
[1:20:02] now there'll be others given eternal
[1:20:03] life at the white throne
[1:20:05] right okay
[1:20:08] but they won't be part of the first
[1:20:09] resurrection
[1:20:16] they can't do it they have to come up
[1:20:19] the second resurrection
[1:20:22] right
[1:20:25] but church here we go into the
[1:20:27] millennial reign with him
[1:20:29] riding on white horses and it says we
[1:20:31] live a thousand years
[1:20:37] that is the first resurrection or it
[1:20:39] says this
[1:20:40] is make sure you stay correct this is
[1:20:44] the first resurrection looked like it
[1:20:46] would have been put over there
[1:20:50] and i believe it was but let's get what
[1:20:52] i'm saying
[1:20:54] looks like at least paul would have said
[1:20:56] this is the first resurrection
[1:21:02] and you know that would have been true
[1:21:03] because the new birth inside of him
[1:21:05] no longer out that lives but christ that
[1:21:07] lives in me and the life that i now live
[1:21:08] by the faith of the son of god
[1:21:10] right amen he knew the resurrection was
[1:21:13] inside of him
[1:21:16] as i said this morning he said i want to
[1:21:18] be a part of the out
[1:21:19] resurrection
[1:21:23] brother around explain that if you need
[1:21:24] it i'll be glad to give you the quote
[1:21:28] he said paul was not talking about a
[1:21:29] resurrection he had the resurrection the
[1:21:31] resurrection was inside of him
[1:21:32] he said he was talking about
[1:21:34] resurrection out from mankind
[1:21:36] out from denominationalism out from the
[1:21:38] thoughts of mankind
[1:21:41] to be without resurrection
[1:21:46] but you see when it gets to the there in
[1:21:47] revelations 20 it says this is the
[1:21:49] resurrection
[1:21:50] this is the first
[1:21:57] but yet jesus said i am the resurrect
[1:22:01] and he said to prove it laughter has
[1:22:02] come out
[1:22:06] now because lazarus come out of the
[1:22:08] grave it didn't put him in the first
[1:22:10] resurrection
[1:22:13] are you with me because he didn't have a
[1:22:15] new birth
[1:22:19] but the new birth was inside of jesus
[1:22:20] christ that's what lazarus needed
[1:22:23] raising the dead was fine but you know
[1:22:24] what he died
[1:22:27] amen
[1:22:32] but you see church the first
[1:22:34] resurrection is the baptism of the holy
[1:22:36] ghost that comes inside of you
[1:22:38] and i in the form of the new birth that
[1:22:41] makes us
[1:22:42] a participant every how you make those
[1:22:44] words a
[1:22:45] partaker of his divine nature
[1:22:49] to bring him into us the i am is now
[1:22:51] living in you and i by the new birth
[1:22:54] or what kind of a god you've got living
[1:22:56] in you you've got some of yahweh's or
[1:22:58] some jehovah or something living in you
[1:23:00] and can't see that the i am is the i am
[1:23:07] you see when we cross over that veil
[1:23:11] because by the time the millennium comes
[1:23:13] to pass
[1:23:14] you're going to be there in an eternal
[1:23:18] immortal did we read it this morning
[1:23:21] eternal immortal body yes glorified by
[1:23:24] the blood of jesus christ
[1:23:27] and when we stand there we can look
[1:23:28] around and say
[1:23:31] brothers and sisters this is the
[1:23:34] resurrection
[1:23:37] this is what i always done down through
[1:23:39] two thousand years of time
[1:23:42] that all born again the believers are
[1:23:44] not standing here
[1:23:46] with eternal life body spirit and soul
[1:23:52] standing immortals
[1:23:57] that's why when they asked brother
[1:23:58] branham said will it be babies born in
[1:24:00] the millennium he said
[1:24:02] he looks like they will be looks like
[1:24:03] they don't i don't know well that's true
[1:24:05] for me i don't know either
[1:24:07] but i i don't believe
[1:24:10] i was thinking about this today may i
[1:24:12] not say it as hard as i thought i just
[1:24:16] don't see how any christian
[1:24:18] could have any thoughts about a baby
[1:24:20] being born in the millennium
[1:24:23] from eternal people
[1:24:29] uh my thoughts are a whole lot harder
[1:24:31] than that
[1:24:34] that's good enough to get the point
[1:24:36] across
[1:24:38] i don't think we're going to be having
[1:24:39] babies from eternal people
[1:24:42] in the millennium but now remember in
[1:24:44] the millennium they will be your
[1:24:47] heather so he said i don't know looks
[1:24:49] like they will look like you won't lord
[1:24:51] ever tell them i'll let you know
[1:24:53] well they never did evident the telecar
[1:24:55] i never read it
[1:24:58] but you mean you're going to be brother
[1:25:00] gary on the eternal
[1:25:01] immortal body spo
[1:25:05] soul spirit and then you're going to be
[1:25:07] thinking about having babies
[1:25:12] you see where our carnality gets
[1:25:14] involved
[1:25:17] so is it with reading this is the first
[1:25:19] resurrection
[1:25:24] he would say well the resurrection look
[1:25:26] that's the first resurrection he said
[1:25:27] but we're in the resurrection no
[1:25:28] the bible says this is the first
[1:25:30] resurrection
[1:25:32] said jesus never said he was the first
[1:25:35] resurrection
[1:25:36] i know he didn't he said he was the
[1:25:40] resurrection
[1:25:40] right so when he said he was the
[1:25:42] resurrection that meant first second
[1:25:44] third fourth lifestyle beginning or
[1:25:45] whatever
[1:25:46] all of it was involved in him right
[1:25:51] and if it was any dead going to raise is
[1:25:53] going to be him
[1:25:55] then he was going to raise up his self
[1:25:58] he said go ahead and destroy this temple
[1:26:00] in three days i'll raise it up
[1:26:03] and he proved it see when we get to the
[1:26:07] millennial ryan if you understand what
[1:26:09] i'm trying to say
[1:26:10] today lived and reigned with christ for
[1:26:12] a thousand years the rest of the dead
[1:26:13] lived not again until a thousand years
[1:26:15] was finished
[1:26:16] this is the first resurrection
[1:26:19] like i said this morning now the
[1:26:22] millennium is not a time
[1:26:27] it is a thousand years upon earth yes
[1:26:30] okay
[1:26:31] but the millennium is a person brother
[1:26:34] brown said jesus had the millennium in
[1:26:36] him
[1:26:42] brother adam was brother aaron was
[1:26:43] bringing some attention a while ago
[1:26:45] brother brown said that the seventh seal
[1:26:47] would usher in the millennium
[1:26:50] people think boys are dead look here
[1:26:52] it's already out here
[1:26:55] no but when it happens it will usher it
[1:26:57] in
[1:27:02] what do we think of
[1:27:08] if a person dies without the baptism in
[1:27:10] the holy ghost will he be lost
[1:27:14] questions and answers in 1954
[1:27:17] no sir if he's a believer
[1:27:21] he'll come in the resurrection
[1:27:24] the second resurrection i guess i got it
[1:27:27] up there by now
[1:27:29] if he's got the baptism he'll go in the
[1:27:32] first resurrection
[1:27:35] because that's what it is the first
[1:27:38] resurrection is the baptism of the holy
[1:27:40] ghost
[1:27:42] the same person that raised lazarus from
[1:27:44] the dead
[1:27:47] comes into you and i by the new earth
[1:27:50] resurrection inside of us but we've got
[1:27:53] to get to the place to get away from
[1:27:55] talking about resurrection over there
[1:27:57] one of these days one day today we're
[1:27:59] going to get to a park
[1:28:02] when are we going to start saying i am
[1:28:04] the resurrection
[1:28:06] now that's just looking for you
[1:28:09] and you know maybe in a way that might
[1:28:11] be right
[1:28:12] well there ain't no such thing as in a
[1:28:14] way that's right because
[1:28:15] my bible says he's the way.
[1:28:19] you understand why it says then in
[1:28:21] revelation 20
[1:28:23] looks like referring to the millennium
[1:28:26] and says this is the first resurrection
[1:28:28] because by that time all those that will
[1:28:32] have partakers
[1:28:33] off this first resurrection without the
[1:28:36] ones going to the white throne that's an
[1:28:38] impartation just given to them
[1:28:40] anybody religious form that had anything
[1:28:42] to do with it by then
[1:28:44] already reached their position
[1:28:48] and we can stand there and say this is
[1:28:50] the resurrection this is what started
[1:28:52] 2000 years ago
[1:28:54] and look where it's completed we're
[1:28:56] standing here
[1:28:58] to live a thousand years
[1:29:02] see this is the first resurrection
[1:29:06] but we stand there and say it but i
[1:29:07] stand here today and say the new birth
[1:29:09] is the first resurrection jesus could
[1:29:12] say
[1:29:13] i raised laughter not to show you he
[1:29:15] said i am the resurrection
[1:29:21] who's living in you
[1:29:27] who is it just living in you well we
[1:29:30] just got the holy ghost brother dale
[1:29:32] yeah
[1:29:32] well the holy ghost is the person of
[1:29:34] jesus christ in spirit form you need
[1:29:36] that one
[1:29:51] on a certain point that there's so many
[1:29:53] uh week weeks after the full moon or
[1:29:55] something you know or whatever it is
[1:29:57] that they determine that to be the
[1:29:58] easter right
[1:30:00] well the old saying was well hal knows
[1:30:02] this real well used to plant everything
[1:30:03] planted on
[1:30:04] good friday but you better not plant it
[1:30:06] this time
[1:30:09] because this is the earliest that the
[1:30:11] good friday's been in a long time
[1:30:13] probably
[1:30:19] you see the resurrection is a person the
[1:30:22] millennium is a person
[1:30:26] the person of almighty god come on
[1:30:28] brother
[1:30:30] the person of almighty god coming and
[1:30:32] living in you and i
[1:30:35] the bible says we're resurrected what
[1:30:37] sitting in heavenly places in christ
[1:30:40] jesus but we're still right here on this
[1:30:43] carnal old natural
[1:30:46] earth getting older
[1:30:50] wear it out
[1:30:54] but we can still say hallelujah
[1:30:59] the more that i think about
[1:31:02] eternal life
[1:31:06] the more i want to get that don't you
[1:31:10] especially the older we get you younger
[1:31:13] ones are still in your prime and you're
[1:31:14] jumping up and down
[1:31:16] you don't want to see it over with but
[1:31:17] that's the older one you want to get it
[1:31:18] over with
[1:31:20] now if according let's see if
[1:31:24] i calculated the time that john
[1:31:28] if he was there with jesus and and maybe
[1:31:31] 30 years old
[1:31:33] when jesus was there in about 80 30 or
[1:31:36] whatever and then 60 years later he was
[1:31:39] on patmos
[1:31:41] because it's 1895-96 so john getting old
[1:31:45] you wouldn't know young chicken like he
[1:31:47] was to start with
[1:31:48] so he said come quickly lord
[1:31:52] right every day i get older i say come
[1:31:57] quickly lord
[1:31:59] you say my old days you used to think
[1:32:01] about boy wouldn't it be great to have a
[1:32:03] million dollars
[1:32:05] and just go out and have a good time and
[1:32:07] just you know i don't mean nothing wrong
[1:32:09] i mean just
[1:32:10] live and not have to worry but what does
[1:32:12] it matter
[1:32:15] what good's a million dollars that's
[1:32:17] right you put it in the bank
[1:32:19] you go down to the bank where's that
[1:32:21] country overseas
[1:32:22] is where it not the one where they keep
[1:32:26] it and won the country just they won't
[1:32:28] even let the people get their money
[1:32:30] cyprus they're withholding their money
[1:32:33] won't let them get the money out
[1:32:36] you think they can't do that today here
[1:32:40] all it takes is one stroke of a bend
[1:32:44] you ain't got nothing in the band
[1:32:47] so why worry about it
[1:32:51] we just have a good time i love living
[1:32:55] yes i love i enjoy being here and being
[1:32:57] with my
[1:32:58] natural family and being with my church
[1:33:00] family and
[1:33:01] that's all i've got i don't really care
[1:33:03] about going all over the world anymore
[1:33:06] even traveling a lot
[1:33:10] just getting here where i want to go
[1:33:11] home
[1:33:13] that's right and you know what brother
[1:33:16] around said the children of israel
[1:33:19] had to be crying out for a deliverer
[1:33:22] remember moses went down there and they
[1:33:25] didn't want him
[1:33:27] but then they began to cry out for a
[1:33:29] deliverer
[1:33:32] and moses was sent he said when a church
[1:33:35] age begins to dwindle down he said that
[1:33:37] people begin to get a
[1:33:39] lick of fire right in him and begin to
[1:33:42] cry out for more and he said god answer
[1:33:44] that with another age to come
[1:33:46] but we're the last one so there's not
[1:33:48] another one
[1:33:52] the next one is the millennium as far as
[1:33:54] earth
[1:33:56] right
[1:34:00] see that is the first resurrection
[1:34:03] like i've always said to you you know
[1:34:06] the day we go up in a rapture
[1:34:10] you can look around at each other and
[1:34:12] say now i know for sure i'm born again
[1:34:15] right you see i know for sure i'm born
[1:34:18] again
[1:34:20] we step over to the millennium you can
[1:34:22] say i know for sure
[1:34:24] amen that the first resurrection was
[1:34:26] right
[1:34:27] and he was that and i am that now we can
[1:34:30] be what
[1:34:35] 252 in the red boat
[1:35:10] but do you know whether you have it or
[1:35:12] not
[1:35:26] last
[1:35:40] anybody
[1:36:08] oh
[1:37:01] one man said to the other one he called
[1:37:03] the name of the school somewhere here in
[1:37:04] the united states
[1:37:06] it's a big school system
[1:37:09] he said they told him said you're
[1:37:11] forbidden to use the word easter
[1:37:15] now i've certainly still been talking so
[1:37:16] i'm just telling you what i heard
[1:37:19] you cannot even use the word easter
[1:37:23] they were both talking about how bad it
[1:37:25] was and what was going on
[1:37:27] so didn't it something that you couldn't
[1:37:28] use the word easter
[1:37:31] because you'd be referring to
[1:37:32] resurrection resurrections
[1:37:35] i looked at the man and one of them and
[1:37:37] i said but you can say any cuss words
[1:37:39] you want to
[1:37:40] can't you he said you're right
[1:37:45] you can call him the devil you call god
[1:37:47] or whatever you want
[1:37:49] but you can't even say the word easter
[1:37:54] isn't that something
[1:37:57] he said but that's not true we can do
[1:38:04] glad
[1:38:08] you know if those things are spoken of
[1:38:10] there somewhere being done
[1:38:15] you go to a mosque for a funeral or
[1:38:18] anything you want to
[1:38:20] you're going to take your shoes off
[1:38:24] you're not going in
[1:38:29] but when they come to our services what
[1:38:31] are you going to tell them they can't
[1:38:32] learn
[1:38:36] and they'll have the law after you but
[1:38:39] yet you call the law because they won't
[1:38:41] let you go in the mosque without
[1:38:42] where they won't let you go without your
[1:38:44] shoes off they're not going to laugh at
[1:38:46] you and say nothing
[1:38:48] you know we're in the end time folks
[1:38:52] whether we want to believe it or not
[1:38:54] we better be thinking about the
[1:38:55] resurrection and the millennium and the
[1:38:57] things you know
[1:38:58] right we better be concerned because
[1:39:01] we're in the end of all things that's
[1:39:03] right
[1:39:07] it's not back 40 years ago when we were
[1:39:10] talking about these things
[1:39:16] right most of you remember that we
[1:39:18] talked about these things it come a day
[1:39:19] when it would be
[1:39:20] we see we're down here today now
[1:39:24] to see the things the prophet said would
[1:39:26] take place and then you read the
[1:39:27] newspaper when you get on today
[1:39:29] and you'll find it
[1:39:33] happening right among us
[1:39:38] the whole country there are cyprus and
[1:39:39] what it is they just close their money's
[1:39:41] time
[1:39:44] you can't go get no money now they're
[1:39:47] trying to figure out how they can open
[1:39:49] them back up
[1:39:50] because they figure once they open them
[1:39:52] back up and everybody's going to flood
[1:39:54] the bike
[1:39:55] to try to get their money but that's
[1:39:58] carnality of the human mind
[1:40:03] do you realize if this economy goes down
[1:40:05] what's in your bank goes down
[1:40:08] you realize what's in your pocket is the
[1:40:11] same stuff that's in the bank
[1:40:14] you know dollar per dollar so if it
[1:40:16] devalues from 50
[1:40:18] down to a one dollar bill in your pocket
[1:40:21] you got a pocket full of one dollar
[1:40:23] bills no matter how many 50s you got
[1:40:27] see it's not what you got in the bank
[1:40:30] it better be what we got stored up in
[1:40:32] heaven
[1:40:34] i want to get out of here
[1:40:38] thank him these times lord jesus bless
[1:40:40] us on the way home
[1:40:41] thank you for these thoughts that we've
[1:40:43] given today we pray that they were given
[1:40:44] correctly in whatever you wanted to be
[1:40:46] saying
[1:40:48] because this is not a general message
[1:40:50] about the resurrection and a lot of
[1:40:52] people preached on and says
[1:40:53] he is risen because we know if it says
[1:40:55] he is risen then he has to be living in
[1:40:57] our hearts and lives
[1:40:59] but it's a message to see what the
[1:41:01] resurrection really is it's not a date
[1:41:04] and a time of the season
[1:41:07] it's reality of eternal life thank you
[1:41:10] for these things lord give us a
[1:41:12] good safe journey on the way home be
[1:41:13] with everybody bless us sick
[1:41:16] those that are listening in lord touch
[1:41:18] each one
[1:41:20] and just let us all be what you want us
[1:41:21] to be we love you and we thank you in
[1:41:23] jesus name
[1:41:30] amen
[1:41:54] he shall be
[1:42:12] me
