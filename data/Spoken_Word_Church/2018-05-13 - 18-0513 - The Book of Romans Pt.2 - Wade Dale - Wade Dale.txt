========================================

here we go all right now last time I was hunting for last we have a real good time in Arizona that with some super duper trip but Chris they tell about hello and you'll be out here sometime in July just a visit not great for just a visitor well let me tell you on Sunday come home from Savannah God was really with us because I'm showing that tractor trailer behind us slam on the brakes and smoke coming out from under and he comes right up beside us that was moving to the left he was moving reckless people were going well all over him did stop dead stop hmm and we were very friend for that anyways yes 65 mile an hour just know well God took care of us like a king amen all right okay that's the angels job all right now we're coming up the book of Romans and we began you can go back a couple of weeks ago any and we just kind of set a stage or what the book of Romans was about Paul had not been to Rome yet but he was going to Rome later on but there was things that were already in Rome so he was talking to them you got to remember some of these letters Marv to either where he had been or where he was going he was admonishing the people that were there that they kept the faith if it was your faith is pumping throughout the whole world in a book Romans but now you got to remember to what happened in Rome Rome was the seat of the Roman Catholic Church they had not started the Roman Catholic Church at that time but it deceives were being planted for Rome Italy to be the seat of the Roman Catholic Church which I breath around said it had to come from a part of like we're doing it that's why I said it you can see the seals in these writings they didn't see it but we can see that with true church in Rome but there was also a false church that was coming up out of room because nastya the nice teen Council it's where they all met and the wrong the people from Rome Rome had physically comforted the world at this time Rome was built in Jerusalem because remember times comes in an 87 team destroying it well this is the 80 60 listen before he even gets there alright so but there's a group of people Brian that is there that Paul needs did - Paul needs to talk to him but now remember this book this whole book is written to Christians but it has multi levels he was writing to the Romans but you and I can clean what we get out of it in this time that's not old writings sure it's a couple thousand years old but it's not old it's the Eternal Word of God God thought so much oh but he put it in the Bible and it was written by Paul notes written by Paul that was letters to the Romans alright and now remember - as we read I want you to help me read this but I want to 1 we talked about something called interpolating and Paul is they he is a master interpolator now what happens is it's like brother branham you remember when the Holy Spirit told brother Brown pick up his pen and Ronald burger is gonna see well see that was what the Holy Spirit said now brother Branham preached a sermon he interpolated all the different things before he read that note he interpolated the whole sermon of his spoken words reason see all right but no but what God wrote was what God wrote he said pick up your pen and write so he was writing what God said the same thing with Paul because Paul he talks to not anybody here right now but once we get closer he starts calling names please right - yeah I'm gonna write the sister Johnny mr. Johnny I hope there were things fine we'll see that's Paul but he's putting in the Word of God not his chapters reverses all right remember these are the letters there's no chapters of emergencies when Paul was writing this man put those chapters and verses in when King James describes started Clinton to Bible together but watch what Paul is in and how you how interpolating works is is that you make the you make a statement and then the comments that you have sometimes when we're preaching if you were to write it now my brother Dale many times if we were going to do the sermon in eighty two of the seals he'll read what brother Brown says he'll read the Bible and then he'll interpolate now maybe thirty minutes for us as ministers because we're interpolating we're not interpreting right re interpolating which means we are inserting something in there to tell you what it means now sometimes I was thinking this morning sometimes we're wrong preachers are wrong but God's not wrong then when when Paul was writing this you might know one thing for sure whatever is in parentheses sure it was Paul's thought but that thought came through the Holy Ghost for me and you to be able to understand or interpret it better then we got that okay so now let's read Paul a servant of Jesus Christ called to be an apostle separated into the gospel of God now look he just right there he's interpolated because watch this is what it should have said Paul the servant of Jesus Christ called to be an apostle separate into the gospel of God concerning his son Jesus Christ our Lord well see you wouldn't get the whole meaning of that in the end interpolated in verse two anywhere you see parentheses that is an interpolation or he is interpreting okay he is interpreting because it's the Holy Ghost through him you and I can do that and be wrong he can't be wrong doing this to me this is the Holy Spirit stopping Paul and saying okay Paul you need to insert this right here now it may not happen he may have just got the thought but remember if he's writing the Bible then that salt was from God it wasn't his talk so he says look Paul a servant of Jesus Christ called been Apostles have read into the gospel of God which he had promised afore by his prophets in the Holy Scripture so what he did he took them back to the Old Testament that's correct he's these time the spirit of the games going instead he's going all the way back because remember there is no Holy Scripture that Paul's looking at except right here from here to here this has not been written yet this is the New Testament so you know I come back to Holy Scriptures he is riding Holy Scripture I don't know that he knows that at that time but he is riding Holy Scripture okay all right so what is saying which he had promised afore by his prophets in the Holy Scripture what separated people call of God to be impossible all right concerning his son Jesus Christ our Lord which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh all right remember no watch and declared to be the Son of God with power according to the spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead that's what concluded the whole thing right by whom we have received Grace and Apostleship for obedience to the faith among all nations for his name among whom are ye now chief when they said that ye it comes all the way to this day and we're just the people he was riding Rome and it was he yeah you right okay cuz remember you got to make this personal he's writing to the Romans but he's writing to menu this is one of the longest letters Paul ever rose so there's something in here and it's right after the book of Acts like I said it was possessed we please right out of the book of Acts so there must be something significant about reading this this longest letter from Romans come it really it's not chronologically it's not in the right order because he wrote Corinthians and maybe 59 he wrote different ones in 1856 but this is a B sixties writing the Romans God through those scholars put this Robert suppose to bei don't remember the other teens brown weren't supposed to be the property garden vindicated it it's right where it's supposed to be all right so this book of Romans is very important to flap like I said last thing there's three things but if you want to write these down you can all right justification is let's do everything let me let me get it to Cusco Scofield got I love this footnote something you can you can take it if you want to certain things you can take that's fine but it hasn't an introduction it's in seven parts the whole world is guilty before God 118 through 322 there's justification through the righteousness of God by faith the gospel remedy for guilt which is chapter 3 through chapter 5 the third ones that crucifix and with Christ the resurrection of life and walking in the spirit is chapter five through eight number four is the full results of the blessing of the gospel chapter 8 through 14 5 is paranthesis the gospel does not abolish to cover the promise to Israel chapter nine through eleven and then number six is Christian life and service chapter 12 to 15 and then 7 is the outflow of Christian love chapter sixteen one through twenty seven so it's the sixteenth chapter and we'll get into that but I want you to I've always been the kind of guy that just you just don't read it I don't need a little background give me something why is Paul saying what he's saying while he's saying it right here why is he saying so this will kind of give you the reason that I believe God put it right after the book last of the book of Acts you've got tender people they have the Holy Ghost and then he knows that you and I are gonna read this right after the book of Acts if we're gonna read it in order then we're gonna read this book of Romans because it caused my justification sanctification and the baptism of Holy Ghost all right so to me that's everything you need there's no one there was oh sure this plan that I had but once you get that then it's God adding to God that sounds strange but it is it's God adding to go okay now verse 3 concerning his son Jesus Christ our Lord which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh and declared to be the Son of God with power according to the spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead by whom we have received Grace and Apostleship what Paul did Paul saying he's transferred whatever he resurrected he transferred it to us so that's what he's doing by the resurrection from the dead reading light all that Paul is writing it to you so you need to you need to compartmentalize this Paul is speaking to you there was a resurrection of Jesus Christ now what's it for he's telling you by them we have received Grace and Apostleship for obedience to the faith among all things now see their obedience to the faith we're going to talk about that a little bit maybe this afternoon about justification remember is not something you can do you can't justify yourself right God has to be the justified but you can walk through sanctification and stop at different places or you can become fully sanctified okay so that's your claim program we're going to quote we run around city that you're not saved by the blade you're staying pilot you have pounds and pounds of blood and do you know good you're saved by the life that was into blood but because the life and the blood were connected then why can wash away my sins nothing but the blood of Jesus but we know as Christians it's not the literal blood because some came through the literal blood honey if I could know you could be you could drown in the blood of Jesus Christ and die go to hell literally but if you got the life of the man so what does the blood day the blood sanctifies it just keeps you watched because remember in the Old Testament if we may get to it this afternoon the Old Testament they sprinkled seven times they would sprinkle the the blood when you got to the children of Israel they put the blood over the door closed now lit up it didn't say to five young people in there because that was a boil animal but it was a type that when the Death Angel came by he said okay they did what you told them to do God's running amok but now that token is not just over the door it waltz in Walmart he walks in targeted walks to the gas station it walks in you're out okay it's listen it's good to apply the token right that's okay but I can apply with token to my children and they don't help but once that token goes in them that's why we pray that our kids get the new birth that our family gets the new birth you know what they take their chance into my throne but I'd rather them be born again blood on the doorpost don't do you any good now yes it's the blood they keeps you sanctified but at last was what one inside of you and then what you are the token see that's what seals reveal the silver building you are the token yeah well huh well okay then being unbelievable I can't like old beekeeper told me said they spring things that will kill you damn good in the wooden any bride cuz what just can't dude can't push it just adore this hey couldn't shut the door okay I wouldn't suck you know okay so can't couldn't and wouldn't those are three friends that you don't want in your house alright so remember that maybe that's a little something you take home I can't when you say I can that means you just you have you have you just I can't do that I can take a body change wine why don't you tell me one your body's already changed according to the Bible so Julian's justified he's already glorified Amen that's right well see you got to look at Paul Paul but see now watch Paul Paul knew he wasn't going tango buddy chain yes paper it was revealed to him and we'll read it later oh maybe hold further where he says we're brother Browne said Paul was trying to get them people out of there get it out of their head that Christ was coming right then sorry cuz Paul knew as a prophet Tom could see Paul could see into this into this age and he knew that they weren't gonna have a rapture in the in the first church age that was just the beginning of the church faith alright so but that's why the Bible is is that onion peel you just keep peeling back you can you can take the sanctification that will clean you and set you aside like I told you a couple seconds ago you know when Zach was what I was using that black you know the unclean spirit goes out all right but now remember remember one thing's for sure when you take sanctification in the level we're talking about the seals it's not to take own answers attached to your soul that old nature's data it's just that Adamic nature that's in this realm that even Jesus was attacked by in his spirit okay so we are attacked in the spirit realm I they kind of looked at me a little cross-eyed in Arizona the other day when I told them I said you flex don't sin it doesn't your flesh is born in sin and it's getting older because of the fall but your flesh should never stand today in its life that's where we got to realize because I told them and when I gave them the scripture which I haven't given here even or just kind of showed it to me when I drill that Scripture but brother Brown sin smoking gambling running around custon he named up he said that is what not sin that's what you do in your body with your body he said what is sin now you don't want to believe with this this has really this has no unbelieving it's the product of unbelief but this has no belief in what is it unbelief is if you're born again it's not your so let's squeeze it down to that spirit room that's where your unbelief is don't have money right see that woman see what she did she was taught that this did everything but remember the same hand that some of us if we're out in the world you know I can hold a beer with this hand and and and do other things and do awful things with my hands I still got the same hands yes but what changed the best one inside that's bad that's what changed one inside and I want to do a little something brother Chris and I were talking like this it's a little bit off the sub D but it's not the because he's telling that resurrection but the Bible says if you serve the tabernacle word is off now see how I'm a part of that I'm not dying I'm not dying if this earthly Tabernacle were dissolved now what is your body your body as a capsule that holds you together I read a quote just this more brother Brown said your bones your flashing your blood is what holds everything together on the outside what do you do when you have a pill that's a capsule that you put in your body what does it do it dissolves so that what's on the inside does you good it's man all right so you're tired when I the word is all been put in the ground what's gonna do you good it's what's inside that capsule okay then you'll reach down and pick that capsule up we know that anyway let's go through this whenever we get we will never get any part of the book much okay yes all right we're good if you don't you're not liking this let me know okay uh hmm among whom are you also the called of Jesus Christ that's us believers listen we've got to believe I told them out there Oh Samuel I believe other mean Creek we gotta believe something that's really never happened cuz now you know we don't know what happened to him he's somewhere but there is a group of people that it's not going and even Jesus had to go to a grave everybody that's born of a woman is David whether we're alive or not but something's got to change that we were not that week which we which are alive and remain that's what we got to that's what we got we which are alive and remain then they coming in Ward we got to shift ourselves into that group but the problem is as we go look you too many graveyards you know we look back well sister Thrones over you know [Music] right here the woman our mind is our greatest problem and it's not your flesh brain your flesh brain is just like this right here there's nothing wrong with it until you put in what what you put in all right okay so now it's what Paul is trying to tell them let's see what you and I have to glean out of this is this since the 1500 people have read this and I give them say sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost okay live a good life that's what brother Branham was saying in them and questions answers on the seals he said go long as you are this is not for you live a good Christian life he wasn't calling him not Christians he just said the right crystal and it's not here to receive when I'm preaching another word well I believe that the rock crystals here amen I mean we're just did one of the people he was talking to okay not saying they were all walks no live a good Christian life you were saved sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost you've done all you supposed to do in your age but when the seals open brethren saw that there was a group of people that was going to do more than just believe because they were believing on to their advice believing on - right now we're believing unto a resurrection we ought to believe into the change okay all right so read the scripture with a little understanding okay what do all the band Lulla all the man Loula Georgia beloved of God called to be Saints grace to you Paul dropping in and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ now remember as we always save this let me give you these little corners as we go along polls not a trinitarian so what's Paul saying peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ if you take that by English that's separating and bringing new chthonian but that word hand if you'll look it up in your lungs and your concordance is that hand is interpreted as even brother they all said it many times for many years so what from God our Father even the Lord Jesus Christ what he's doing is is he's given Jesus full benefit the Godfather even the Lord Jesus Christ he's the same person all right first I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all because remember when you got to go to Christ yes Jesus Christ is to walk the way the truth and the life could walk to understand the father to understand the father you got to go through Jesus Christ oh he wasn't healing we never met God the Creator no man has seen God in a town called the Bible but there was somebody came here that what showed us who he was alright and that way we cannot you can't understand a God that when he spoke Genesis 1:26 that today he's not one second over not one second is he older than when he said let there be life and it's been of course Megan to you if you wanted to be and you can't fathom that neither can i how can you find an eternity brother Brown's eternity go to both ways so you go back as far as you want to you keep on being being BAE BAE BAE BAE available to keep on big baby baby in and he's not even a second over than he was see we can't find that but now Jesus trots them down in time we can fathom that so through him I can see the father man if you've seen me you've seen the father that's right I think my dog do Jesus Christ for you all that your faith is spoken of throughout the world Loula Georgia for God is my witness whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his son that without ceasing I made mention of you always in my prayers making requests if by any means now a twinks I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you all right so he's requesting to go to Rome all right for how long to see you that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift to the interview may be established now look Paul's not standing there with a bag of gifts and they have nothing that's not what he said but remember Paul comes to Timothy or whoever it was he lays his hand on Timothy and he receives gift because the life comes through the body maybe Rome had not been taught the thing same way with Luther Georgia maybe there's people that don't understand our language but we may Park some spiritual gift because the first thing we say spirit from here why don't we think of I think the first wisdom faith read them all okay times and interpretations are okay but if you don't have wisdom you know what is today the man I said if you don't have wisdom it's the devil the devil just speaking time all right but he can't have wisdom of God he can't have the wisdom of God you can have the wisdom of God and then black Paul says let me interpolate Paul is saying I might have something that you have not previously had before not so secret not some I'm better than you are Paul never puffed himself up but Paul being a prophet he knew if he could go to them and speak to them he may have something a little extra together wisdom faith knowledge and all those different things okay so Paul's not puffing it up he's saying he said that I'm laying apart unto you some spiritual gift look to the end you may be established what establish what church no sounds them to faith right cuz they don't have a Bible to read seeing how they look at that they don't have a Bible to read so they have to have faith in what some man said that's why in the first three church changes God protected that white rocks his church the real one there was a false when they connected to it you know what that falsehood is started teaching the same thing the other ones did except about that much off just enough to get them off but there was a true church there and Paul was talking to the true church that when they absorb something from the preacher it went into them any what if it bore fruit okay that's what Paul's saying sound coming to impart to you some spiritual gift not gifts believe us a prophet if even the prophet from God we should listen to it same way we run around meet the property god we should listen to Minister the gospel brother they don't need anybody like that you should listen to it and then the good thing we have is though is we have the internet and we have Paul's and record and play and backwards and listen to it yesterday but you know what I was thinking the other day do you know if you were saying who wanted Paul Sherman and he was preaching your sermon and you didn't make him back into the same service your Lobster you lost it are you gonna get it they went somewhere I wasn't riding it down now Paul me under the grace of God mate do I wait to a lot of times and back up and you know redo a part of it sermon but if you missed it you dismissed it but you know what though I knew that God knew that we would have everything else involved was talking to somebody the other day you know God knows we're busy he knew this was what we needed we had to have something in writing we had to have something on the internet that we weren't busy or take a vacation not a problem with that don't mind it a bit all right but just lay it out to you know that you know when you're laying out or not we don't have to be we don't have to get up freaks about people laying out of church you know when you let out you're you know going somewhere that's fine and you know what we got all this other these other things you can watch online stuff which is wonderful they didn't have that back then but you know what God equipped them with some sounding board some hearing that we don't have comes remember the Bible says we have become dull of hearing yes we have yes I guess they focused a lot more on own sermons than we do that sometimes we'll get that next one do one sermon that's it one had done I mean they were warning in from one sermon and it went alone you know 45 minutes maybe I don't know if all that was written down is everything Peter said but you know what they got the gist of what Paul Peter was talking about and they said man I don't want what you pierce it okay repent so anyway so let's keep going a real American clock alright verse 12 that is that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith of both of you and me so they're putting afraid together that's our problem is we are facing this and that in the other and the other brother over here in this other preacher over here I don't say listen don't be so narrow-minded we we can't listen listen to me we can't listen just the brother Dale to make it that's not what the Bible said about said apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelist for the perfecting of the Saints we gonna make fivefold ministry you can't make it with it we had a one-man message and that was William Brown now it's multiple multiple we need we need the different diversities that's why we so follow it's a five for mastery you open one fold and there's apostle you open this follow that's prophet open this told that's teacher right well verse 13 now I would not have you ignorant brethren that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you now here he's in trapeze telling him why but was let let hitherto in other words what was he done he would let here - in other words he was hindered whether God didn't wanted to go there you know brother a lot of times he prayed God tell him no you wouldn't go okay okay then I might have some fruit among you also even as among other Gentiles because remember most of Romans most of Rome was Gentiles there was a few Jews but most of Roman man that I mean there he's and Gentiles remember Rome conquers world and maybe they the ones that come up with crucifixion that they're going to come up with all these horrible tortures and stuff okay so Rome was just a heathen place or Italy you may say the country of Italy was Italy Italy at that time yeah but was it just Rome a part of whatever do yeah wasn't it wasn't it wasn't Italy so we'll just use Rome because Rome is gonna be the seat of everything anyways so kind of interesting that holds all the way through that you know even even when we get the revelations they're gonna drop a bomb in the Vatican you know run around said they gonna drop a bomb right on top of the batteries so will the Vatican is we're in Rome downtown yeah okay so so that's the seat you know that's the seat of Satan that's where and you know what it's gonna make the people even made nominal people so mad it's gonna make politicians so mad it's gonna make the government so mad to whoever's bomb it is it's gonna hit that thing and blow it up so they hated it to verse 14 I am dead or both to the Greeks and to the barbarians oh my gosh all don't go talk to them people but he's in debt to them both to the wives and I'm like what kind of grace is that so as much as in as in me is I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also so he's getting ready to make the trip all right for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that what he brings it to do Greek Rome anybody to everyone that believeth keep going to the Jew first no we know obviously we know that he came that Jesus Christ came to the Jews first okay and they turned you down so low I go to the Gentiles I mean you you got that right know what for there in now what they're in what what is there in the salvation because it the power of God in salvation see Paul holiness stop for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith see that's the statue of Pergamon you keep on believing faith virtue remember I preached a long time ago virtue faith knowledge faith temperance faith you got to believe that that's what God that that's the face of God and that the virtue has the virtue of God temperance is attention temperance of God as it is written the just shall live by faith he goes right back to a lack of two and four so he goes back in the Old Testament and pulls it out to just shall live by faith now see that guy these letters I don't want to say got lost but they kind of did you know the didn't get picked up the label found and put together and all that because what Martin Luther picks that out right there he says man that's in the Old Testament and now I'm reading Paul what you mean the just shall live by faith I gotta do penance is that me I understand why Martin Luther preached to just shall live by faith they just shall live by faith now what the Catholic Church is is the just shall live by penance right don't eat fish cracker eat fish on Friday and you don't still on family take your rosary bead that's untrue three beads but take the rosary beads out break well times you know the certain Saints right that's what the Catholic Church had put from right here from right here he's talking until Martin Luther which dish was in 80 60 of Martin Luther came in about one 1400 1500 some went down look come on I stay here mess that up cause Paul's telling me said hey the power of God unto salvation is that to just show everything and that string we still do that we live my faith we are faith people yeah show me justification take it out hitting them show me sanctification take you down entertain you because I don't have faith if I say well I don't need to find my I don't I find the phone there any one hand that's not faith faith is like brother branham saying this so i stumped a lot of people he said if i may have left my knife on them on the counter in the motel room he said but i if i believe they died put it in my pocket it'll be in my heart that's faith without sight roman catholic church was faith with sight because look you gotta understand one thing there are some we said roman catholic and everybody goes hell down here you know no they're not all hellbound people God will give them eternal life maybe whatever they decide by their works that's all they knew that's all we knew but when Martin Luther don't say that's how I work when Martin Luther comes out in that fourth Church age 15 and says the judge oh my fate and began preaching that's why that's why brother MC turn the world upside down why he changed her thinking but what happened was they got so radical about it so they went out and started burning Catholic churches and killing I don't know if he ever killed a priest but they sure didn't beat him up pretty bad that way what Martin Luther was saying he was he was not saying the just shall live by the sword no he was saying the just shall live by faith and you know what he was preaching of separation gospel yes but not separating kill these you know do away with these no you gotta leave them alone leave them out here but you separate yourself so here Paul is saying the just shall live by faith he's going back to lavaca but Martin Luther Reeves axes man I see it in Paul's writings and I see it in the Old Testament there's something to this and you know what the Holy Ghost comes down quick things what he read and here he went we don't need to you know be if you ever watch the movie now that movie was good I think it was however finds or one of them played it was a more modern one but it really showed that he was trying to be a good mom he was trying to be a good Catholic guy yeah I mean he'd crawl on the floor and lay out you know on the floor trying to get those evil things out of his mind and all all you need was didn't you burn he didn't need to beat itself okay so that's what Paul's saying you believe faith you gotta take faith than believing and put them together okay faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen so nobody has seen Jesus Christ hanging on cross Lily okay when I stand over there in Arizona the thunders are is this great mystery that God's hid in the Bible but it's in every word every page of the Bible is a thunder comes was the voice of God speaking in a man all right so let's finish this right here and then we'll go down about two minutes force 18 for the wrath of God is revealed from heaven remember there's nothing on earth going to give you a revelation your revelation has to come from God out of this dimension from another dimension to use that's what he's saying it's revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men look who hold the truth in unrighteousness now we're gonna stop right there don't you think about that till next Sunday look they hold the truth in unrighteousness they have the truth but somehow they add something or take something from it make it unrighteous we'll talk about that next honey let's go yep [Music] listeners unrighteousness of men who [Music] hold the truth in unrighteousness [Music]
