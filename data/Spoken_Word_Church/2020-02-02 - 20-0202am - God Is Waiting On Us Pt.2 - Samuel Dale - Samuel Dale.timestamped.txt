[23:25] still on Hebrews 11 so let's start there
[23:29] and just read the scriptures from
[23:32] Hebrews 11 and continue I thought on
[23:35] into the point we're trying to bring
[23:39] okay brother Lewis is not here he's over
[23:44] brother
[23:45] I think brother burly's this morning and
[23:46] brother Williams is seeding it or
[23:48] something like that
[23:49] he's got four day to day so I'll
[23:52] remember that and we'll try to get in
[23:54] touch with him to tell him he's gonna do
[23:55] Wednesday too so that'll give him a full
[23:57] week you can do those times okay so if
[24:01] you contact him tell him to be expected
[24:04] that's it you know to be here the Lord
[24:06] willing wins d4 don't then we'll figure
[24:08] out something else
[24:09] okay all right hebrews 11:32 remember
[24:13] what we're saying this is written about
[24:16] the Old Testament Saints and their faith
[24:20] journey and the things that are
[24:23] transpiring or were transpiring with
[24:26] them then and you know it's really still
[24:28] transpiring some of the things that are
[24:31] here are still taking place to the
[24:33] natural Israel all right and it will
[24:36] finish up in in you know in the doing
[24:39] but this is what our lives well verse 32
[24:41] in what shall I more say for the time
[24:44] would fail to tell of gideon and of
[24:47] Baruch and of Samson and jeppesen of
[24:50] David also and Samuel and of the
[24:53] prophets who through faith subdued
[24:56] righteousness obtained obtained promises
[24:59] stopped the mouths of lions now notice
[25:01] they have achieved certain things so
[25:04] they attained some promises but in the
[25:05] minute we'll see they didn't didn't get
[25:07] all the promise quench the violence of
[25:10] this violence of fire escaped the edge
[25:12] of the sword out of weakness was made
[25:15] strong waxed violent and fire turned to
[25:19] flight the armies of the aliens women
[25:21] received their dead raised to life again
[25:23] and others were tortured and accepting
[25:26] not accepting deliverance that they
[25:29] might obtain a better resurrection all
[25:32] right no others had trial of cruel
[25:36] mockings and scourging
[25:38] yay moreover of bonds and of
[25:41] imprisonment they were stoned they were
[25:44] sawn asunder were tempted were slain
[25:47] with the sword and they wandered about
[25:50] in sheepskins and goatskins being
[25:51] destitute afflicted tormented even the
[25:55] world was not worthy they wandered in
[25:57] deserts and in mountains and in dens and
[25:59] caves of the earth these all having
[26:01] obtained a good report through faith
[26:04] received not the promise no they never
[26:10] attained to the promise but look at all
[26:13] that the great things that they done and
[26:15] it happened there under those Old
[26:17] Testament Saints God having provided
[26:19] some better thing for us that they
[26:22] without us should not be made perfect
[26:25] you may be seated
[26:26] the Lord that is blessing through the
[26:28] reading of the word alright what is the
[26:34] yeah you don't have to turn all of them
[26:38] all
[26:41] knew by doing the switches okay all
[26:45] right all right now as I've tried to get
[26:50] you to see and I've spoke on these
[26:51] things many times but trying to move on
[26:53] into it a better thought of
[26:56] understanding that we could follow and
[26:58] talk about that these great warriors of
[27:01] faith that we call these ones that done
[27:05] all of these things but yet they never
[27:09] came to a perfect ending of all that
[27:13] they'd done they never received the new
[27:16] birth right they achieved a lot of
[27:20] things done a lot of things under the
[27:23] anointing of the Holy Ghost all right
[27:25] but they never received the promise what
[27:29] promise the promise of the baptism of
[27:32] the Holy Ghost all right what else would
[27:36] be the promise they never received that
[27:38] point so then they're by by not
[27:40] receiving the Holy Spirit see they could
[27:43] not come to a plea to a state of
[27:45] completion which that word perfect gar
[27:49] they could not be made perfect that
[27:51] doesn't mean that's a sinless perfection
[27:54] it means the point of being not complete
[27:59] if Matthew 5:48 be therefore perfect
[28:02] even as your father in heaven is perfect
[28:04] and that does not mean sinless
[28:07] perfection there it means that you have
[28:10] not achieved a complete goal all right
[28:13] now
[28:14] then they without us should not be made
[28:17] perfect you say yeah but Jesus raised
[28:20] the Old Testament Saints according to
[28:22] Matthew 4 and 4 all of them didn't raise
[28:26] many of the Old Testament Saints didn't
[28:28] raise and Paul has no problems putting
[28:32] David in this group and putting all the
[28:36] different ones into this group of here
[28:38] that's waiting he had no problem with
[28:41] that why should we have problem with it
[28:43] yeah but see I heard brother songs when
[28:46] I saw I heard two brother you know and
[28:48] they said well now Jesus raised them
[28:50] back
[28:51] and without him they couldn't be made
[28:54] perfect and said now it's making the New
[28:57] Testament - worth it without us they
[29:00] cannot be made perfect well what you
[29:02] want to do that will not leave it all
[29:04] it's in Jesus
[29:06] whether it be old our New Testament the
[29:10] resurrection and the things are defended
[29:12] upon him not dependant upon me and you
[29:14] that would be something that we would do
[29:16] that would be a form of something of a
[29:19] sinless perfection that we could draw
[29:21] forth and and then they could be chained
[29:23] no no it's all in Christ he is the
[29:27] resurrection there's there's nothing
[29:29] that's not a great thing that they're
[29:31] saying well we could do this but we got
[29:33] to wait on them well alright if that's
[29:37] true then let's get on with what's doing
[29:39] that's the only thing that I've ever
[29:40] said whatever you think this will take
[29:43] place to do these things let's get on
[29:46] with it
[29:47] let's get it into manifestation because
[29:49] we've had 50 years since they're going
[29:52] or the Prophet - brought these things -
[29:56] pies alright and see then we're not
[29:59] looking at something to try to raise
[30:01] them from the dead and perfect them even
[30:07] if you would say okay we're talking
[30:08] about the New Testament of Luther them
[30:10] and all like that they're not made
[30:11] they're not at the perfection because
[30:14] they're not in the glorified state all
[30:16] right what's even if you could bring
[30:18] them up in it they'd still be problems
[30:20] you know not problems in the flesh uh
[30:23] but problems because you wouldn't be
[30:25] fulfilling the rest of the work
[30:27] everything is waiting on you and I all
[30:31] right but now is our point we tried to
[30:33] end the message to give you a background
[30:36] enough to be able to say what we wanted
[30:40] to say and what we were talking about is
[30:43] God is waiting on you and I see we spend
[30:49] a lot of emphasis and it's wonderful
[30:50] that those people back here the Old
[30:53] Testament they're waiting on you and I
[30:55] aren't the best you can do out of the
[30:58] Old Testament Saints is go to
[31:00] revelations four and pick up that
[31:04] 24 elders which is twelve apostles
[31:06] twelve patriarchs and you say well those
[31:09] and you know they're there but remember
[31:13] they're not there in glorified bodies
[31:17] but a bit of a wolf where's the Twelve
[31:21] Apostles are they there in glorified
[31:24] bodies I just have simple questions I
[31:29] like to do that I like to ask questions
[31:31] if you think the Old Testament was
[31:33] perfected okay well what about the new
[31:36] words if where's the apostles so chapter
[31:39] four is not literal glorified people it
[31:45] would have to be something different
[31:46] because those in chapter four the 24
[31:49] elders Twelve Apostles fourth patriarch
[31:52] the Twelve Apostles is their bodies is
[31:54] in the grave right I mean is that
[31:58] Scripture their bodies are still in the
[32:00] grave
[32:01] waiting on you and I you know the 12
[32:03] apostles you know hold the church is
[32:06] dependent waiting on you and I not but
[32:11] see then we have something to do as
[32:13] we'll get to it later in the message
[32:15] brother Brennan said that Jesus never
[32:17] completed his whole thing because he
[32:23] left something for us well alright if
[32:26] they something left
[32:28] that's not completed then the point is
[32:31] right everybody is waiting and dependent
[32:34] upon this endtime bride whether it be
[32:38] Old Testament Saints or New Testament
[32:40] Saints everybody's waiting on me and you
[32:44] even God is we've tried to emphasize
[32:47] with the life's messenger even God is
[32:50] waiting on you and I well God's waiting
[32:55] on us no I'm waiting on God well you're
[32:57] not getting what I'm talking about
[32:59] you're trying to make it into some other
[33:02] form God is waiting on you and I to
[33:05] believe him and let him make it benefit
[33:07] it'll all be him that's what I've said a
[33:09] moment ago would it be Old Testament
[33:11] resurrection where it be New Testament
[33:13] it's all in Jesus Christ it ain't you
[33:15] and me in a way
[33:16] it's just what we're doing it's the
[33:18] position that we have been put in
[33:20] somebody has to stand in this place why
[33:25] can't we believe we're them somebody's
[33:28] going to do it why can't we believe that
[33:30] we're the people the Bible says that
[33:33] were the people at the end of all things
[33:34] is coming for well why can't we believe
[33:36] that all right see then what was our
[33:40] point that we covered last week on
[33:43] uncovering it you know trying to show
[33:45] and brother Branham says they don't want
[33:47] to pull these I'll give you a number and
[33:49] we'll start with of it in a minute but
[33:51] brother Branham said on my chest it was
[33:53] a great priest he says those Old
[33:57] Testament talking about Abraham Isaac
[33:59] Jacob those who were heirs of the
[34:02] promise looking forward to us not to
[34:06] fail looking forward to us not to fail
[34:12] well and he says for without us they
[34:16] cannot be made perfect and how they're
[34:19] depending on us to us this morning let's
[34:25] not fail those Old Testament Saints is
[34:29] dependent upon me yeah but how are their
[34:31] dependent there they're not in the
[34:32] glorified body that's what a point I try
[34:36] to make so you listen what about you 24
[34:39] elders in my revelations for you're
[34:43] gonna have the Twelve Apostles sitting
[34:46] there in some form and their body in the
[34:49] grave and you're gonna have a twelve
[34:51] apostles you know twelve Old Testament
[34:53] prophets sometimes you're gonna have
[34:56] them there in glorified bodies no that's
[35:02] why everything's waiting on you and I
[35:06] everything is waiting on this end time
[35:08] people well why can't we believe that if
[35:13] they're not waiting on that's why
[35:15] they're waiting on well we're waiting on
[35:17] time to run out I didn't believe that in
[35:21] the Baptist and I certainly don't
[35:22] believe it now I was looking for
[35:25] something and I'm still looking for
[35:26] something what I'm looking for God to
[35:28] come on the scene and make his work
[35:30] life make manifest what he said he would
[35:33] do he's put it all into this position
[35:37] all right we gave you another one we're
[35:38] brother Brennan said from the message
[35:40] glorify Jesus have it to those Old
[35:43] Testament Saints are looking now without
[35:47] us they cannot be perfected so they're
[35:50] depending on us to believe God's Word
[35:57] they what a weird word you said well
[35:59] well what are we to do brother Dale to
[36:01] try to make us believe God's Word
[36:05] first I'll believe he's talking about
[36:07] you cousins we was talking about it last
[36:12] night in the Bible study see everything
[36:17] is waiting for somebody to just stand up
[36:22] and say I believe it well we're not it
[36:27] no that's that's the point see a man
[36:30] named Martin Luther looked at the Bible
[36:32] looked at the things looked at the world
[36:34] looked at the church and he come out and
[36:37] he preached the just shall live by faith
[36:39] all right God was waiting on that he was
[36:46] waiting on Martin Luther to fulfill his
[36:48] word well see we say Martin Luther was
[36:52] waiting on God we're really God was
[36:54] waiting on him he's waiting on somebody
[36:57] the Prophet said if God can get one
[36:59] person to believe his word he said he
[37:02] can do what he needs to do just one
[37:03] person they don't take a world full of
[37:05] people see John Wesley come forth with
[37:08] being the coming to America to preach to
[37:11] the Indians to convert and found out he
[37:13] said I needed to be saved myself
[37:15] he goes back with a message of
[37:16] sanctification and confounds the world
[37:19] with it you know what we'll do it God
[37:21] was waiting on John Wesley there were
[37:25] people that are already had preached
[37:26] sanctification to Moravians ever how you
[37:29] pronounce their name they were teaching
[37:31] that own sanctification that's where
[37:33] Martin Luther I mean where John Wesley
[37:35] went to them and caught what they were
[37:37] doing and went back home pretty because
[37:40] he's seen him alive
[37:42] if you remember the story they were in a
[37:44] boat and the boat was about to sink well
[37:47] over here is the people burnt over there
[37:48] second and over here was the Moravians
[37:51] is singing and worshiping and just
[37:52] having a good time you know kind of
[37:58] reminds me of the lady he remember the
[38:00] Prophet was telling about the story of
[38:01] it and the lady said well if the captain
[38:03] said was boats going down in 30 minutes
[38:05] she's hollering praise God praise God
[38:07] glory hallelujah he said you didn't
[38:09] understand we're going down in 30
[38:10] minutes or we're gonna be in the harbor
[38:12] the lady said well said I got a daughter
[38:15] in the harbor and I got one in glory
[38:16] said in 30 minutes I'm gonna be with one
[38:19] of them she was resourcing two that she
[38:23] wasn't the Moravians wasn't afraid
[38:26] that's what Westwick what it called they
[38:29] need he knew them they had something he
[38:31] didn't have so he needed that he already
[38:34] had the new birth of justification he
[38:37] was preaching what a Luther's messaging
[38:39] and all like that coming forth with old
[38:41] Sonny but yet he needed a further
[38:44] advancement so what was happening he
[38:48] said well no God was waiting he's
[38:53] waiting on somebody now to just stand up
[38:57] and believe it and say thank you he can
[39:03] make it manifest he got no problem
[39:05] making it manifest he can do that
[39:09] without us but yet he said his self he's
[39:12] waiting on us because we're talking
[39:14] about life's not cease the brothers
[39:16] asking the question about you know
[39:18] finding the Bible and reading the Bible
[39:20] say I don't have to read in the Bible
[39:22] that I can read it that without us
[39:25] they're not perfect but see I don't have
[39:28] to read that I know they're not perfect
[39:30] I know something is wrong
[39:35] something is wrong would you agree with
[39:38] that today that there's something wrong
[39:40] we've been 50 years after the going of
[39:44] the Prophet and had an opportunity to
[39:47] get into the word what's wrong it's
[39:49] evidently you and I so evidently God is
[39:54] waiting on somebody
[39:56] to step forth well okay why can't we
[40:01] believe with that wonder step four see
[40:03] all right you are you following what I'm
[40:05] saying he's his own perfection talking
[40:09] about the Old Testament heroes with
[40:11] heroes of faith and he says without us
[40:15] they could not be made perfect because
[40:18] they're of the shadow of this to come
[40:25] and see we've heard it verifies ability
[40:27] purport to be right when it when it's
[40:29] speaking of these here that never
[40:31] receive the promise do you understand
[40:34] that they never received the promise
[40:36] they never got to a salvation point they
[40:41] never got to a new birth those Old
[40:44] Testament Saints they were waiting Jesus
[40:48] had to come they to bring that to where
[40:52] they could come to salvation later date
[40:55] because they never received it they
[40:57] rejected him they turned it down and
[40:59] they're still to this day waiting
[41:04] waiting on God to fulfill his word you
[41:09] go over talk to those Jews and I just
[41:10] sent over our twiddling their thumbs
[41:15] they're reading their studying they're
[41:18] getting everything for fire they're
[41:19] trying to do everything trying to build
[41:21] a temple trying to do everything that
[41:22] that they think will be the part of it
[41:25] but we know what's going to be the part
[41:28] of it one day there's gonna be two
[41:30] witnesses walk out there and they're
[41:34] gonna see who they are okay that's all
[41:36] that I'm trying to get you and I to do
[41:38] and see who we are the Prophet said when
[41:40] the bride realizes who she is and what
[41:42] she's here for
[41:43] he said she'll be an investable army
[41:46] alright God's waiting on you and I
[41:51] become to find it out after we're doing
[41:54] all of it and we say God he's waiting
[41:58] for you and I to realize who we are
[42:01] well I don't know one day I'll feel like
[42:05] I'm saying next day I wonder about it
[42:07] well what you need is a good
[42:10] of salvation are you saying I'm not safe
[42:13] yeah I don't mind saying it that way one
[42:16] brother one time he said brother Dale
[42:18] said he got up and told him people that
[42:20] I wouldn't say I didn't do it the next
[42:25] time I talked to him I said you told him
[42:27] people a lie I never said you wouldn't
[42:29] say yes you said I said no I said he
[42:32] fewer and saves you wouldn't act like
[42:34] you are
[42:35] I said now if you want to turn that
[42:38] around and say it I'm saying you're not
[42:39] saved I'm saying you're not saved see
[42:43] somebody's got to come to a place to
[42:45] where we can believe it and say thank
[42:51] you lord
[42:52] and let him come on the scene all right
[42:54] because what is it trying to get down to
[42:57] that point brother Branham covers on
[42:58] what the Holy Ghost is given for what if
[43:01] the Holy Ghost he said without us that
[43:05] cannot be made perfect see what did the
[43:07] Old Testament Saints need they needed
[43:11] the Holy Spirit right they needed a new
[43:14] birth all right what do they need now
[43:18] the Bible says until this day the veil
[43:23] is over their eyes and whether they're
[43:26] in the grave there waiting or whether
[43:29] they're live there waiting waiting on
[43:33] watch waiting on you and I to get out of
[43:38] the way let's see if I'm here quoting
[43:41] ones talking about the pillar of fire
[43:43] coming something and it's / phrasing but
[43:45] he said said they see that pillar of
[43:50] fire coming after you and me think it's
[43:52] coming after them right thank you coming
[43:58] after them
[43:59] but now it's coming like for you and I
[44:00] because we're the next in order and what
[44:04] we do and we step out of here that can
[44:06] follow us thinking they don't have any
[44:11] way to go because you got a house
[44:13] something in front of you yeah that
[44:17] early church walked out in the faith of
[44:19] God and you know what today I still
[44:21] believe that
[44:22] Martin Luther preached to just shall
[44:24] live by faith and I still believe that
[44:27] I'm still based upon what he said well
[44:30] right based on what he said called he
[44:32] drank beer and sat in the pub smoke the
[44:34] pot well boy you know the gospel you
[44:39] sure are in good shape God's waiting on
[44:41] you and me to get out of that junk
[44:43] that's the denominationalism all right
[44:47] sorry but it's true right okay without
[44:52] us they cannot be made perfect they
[44:54] lived in one day we live in another day
[45:01] so it's all dependent right here where
[45:03] we're at okay he says on the message the
[45:09] statue of a perfect man see then you'd
[45:11] see coming into the New Testament these
[45:14] people who died in here are dependent
[45:18] and waiting on us so this church has got
[45:22] to come to perfection in order to bring
[45:26] the resurrection and thereunder souls
[45:29] under the altar waiting for this church
[45:32] to come to the perfection that Christ
[45:35] does come those people all the way down
[45:40] through time of the New Testament
[45:42] they're waiting on you and I we have the
[45:48] greatest responsibility of all ages
[45:53] because everybody is dependent upon
[45:56] whether or not we can believe who we are
[45:58] but you see the people of the message
[46:00] now what are they doing they're doing
[46:02] their best and destroy the message
[46:05] instead of trying to get into the
[46:08] message and believe in it leave it there
[46:15] you know brother Russ atomic density you
[46:19] know that brother Brian said if you
[46:21] catch me off one word he said didn't I'm
[46:26] totally out well now what is he meaning
[46:30] he was a human being
[46:33] that we got a lot of experience I mean a
[46:35] lot of things that he'd done and to
[46:38] happen is he waiting is he's saying if
[46:41] one word off or is he saying it the
[46:44] correct way then it if it is one word
[46:46] off it's not what we're doing they're
[46:48] not doing it's whether or not we believe
[46:50] the Word of God if he was one word off
[46:54] then I don't want to believe him well I
[46:57] can show where he missed to that come
[47:00] let's talk about it that's what I say
[47:05] you're so gallant to holler and scream
[47:07] about it coming let's talk we'll take
[47:11] our time we'll sit down and we'll
[47:13] discuss it I'm not gonna argue with
[47:14] nobody but I'll be glad to discuss it I
[47:16] sure like that earnestly contending for
[47:19] the faith you know I like that part
[47:22] ain't gonna argue with you about it I'm
[47:24] just gonna believe what he said okay
[47:26] we'll see we know then for understanding
[47:29] that it's not talking about something
[47:34] that we can raise the dead we can do
[47:36] this we can do that if talking about the
[47:40] fact that when the bride realized who
[47:42] she is and what she's here for
[47:45] you said well what are we here for we're
[47:47] here to be that part of the people of
[47:50] God that can believe God's Word enough
[47:52] until the world is waiting everything's
[47:56] waiting upon the bride of Jesus Christ
[47:58] to realize who they are you said well
[48:04] mama Nelson well mom was waiting on you
[48:10] let's believe it to where we can go
[48:12] forth with it all right now he's waiting
[48:18] and see we look at something and we say
[48:21] we can't see that but I just don't see
[48:25] that made manifest you know so that by
[48:28] we were rejected okay all right on the
[48:32] message of the statute of a perfect man
[48:33] he says it like this this church has got
[48:39] to be honed the church has got to be
[48:46] home
[48:47] and all those stones fitting together
[48:49] and he says all right
[48:51] not only just some creed or doctrine or
[48:56] something other we come through it'll
[48:59] have to be so perfectly like Christ to
[49:03] when he comes he in that ministry will
[49:07] fit right smack together well I just
[49:12] don't say nobody would administer your
[49:14] Jesus Christ
[49:15] open your eyes what are you looking for
[49:18] what do you got 1/2 to where God could
[49:20] prove it into you well you know I think
[49:28] you'd ought to be these great signs of
[49:29] one now your prophet Wade's been doing a
[49:31] good job on that talking about a revival
[49:33] the revival is not signs and wonders and
[49:37] move books and isn't that in the other
[49:38] that's the after-effects of the revival
[49:42] the revival is to revive the person
[49:48] bring the person to a place in Christ
[49:51] that God can move on the scene my whole
[49:55] emphasis has been on one thing on this
[49:57] point they're trying to get us to see
[49:59] cuz I said I preached this and many many
[50:01] times just a few months ago we would on
[50:03] this about they without us cannot be
[50:05] made perfect well my point now is for
[50:07] one thing God is waiting on you and I
[50:13] all right he's waiting for us right to
[50:21] do some things and let's see what those
[50:23] things are now as we try to go through
[50:25] it this at this day all right now look
[50:29] at it like this go ahead and them will
[50:31] start from number six they can pull up
[50:36] number six which is God's provided way
[50:39] of healing then run it down to the
[50:41] bottom where we got it you say well
[50:44] brother branham you say let us that's
[50:47] what God is waiting on
[50:54] we're waiting on Jesus to return and
[51:04] Jesus is waiting on us that we excel we
[51:10] can see that easily that we're waiting
[51:12] on Jesus to come and do something but
[51:14] he's waiting on us to do something what
[51:19] does he expect us to one time believe
[51:21] him he's not waiting on us to do these
[51:25] great signs and wonders and is that
[51:27] caught we can't do him anyway he's
[51:30] waiting on us to believe them
[51:32] is that the point we're waiting on Jesus
[51:35] to return and Jesus is waiting on us so
[51:39] they ain't gonna be no return of Jesus
[51:41] Christ unless the bride realizes it look
[51:45] you say well now what can we do about it
[51:50] okay
[51:55] the Bible said the hour has come and his
[51:59] bride has made herself ready
[52:02] hallelujah made herself ready now how
[52:06] are you gonna make yourself ready I mean
[52:10] my little bride my wife got up this
[52:12] morning and she made herself ready she
[52:19] put on some clothes she took a bath she
[52:21] done the things that was necessary for
[52:24] her to do and she put on some clothes
[52:26] that had no you know what a meaning
[52:30] trying to get to her did I doubt for her
[52:34] all right
[52:36] I bought up she put him on well she's
[52:41] making herself ready and that's all God
[52:47] is willing to do he's already paid for
[52:49] everything's all available all we got to
[52:51] do just believe it and accept it
[52:52] we don't have to work nothing up he done
[52:55] done in this house
[52:56] all right look see then is what does he
[53:01] say we're waiting on Jesus to return
[53:04] when that when he comes boy I'll tell
[53:07] you what it's gonna be great now when he
[53:09] comes he's got one eye well how come he
[53:11] ain't got here maybe it's you and me
[53:23] maybe it's you and me well maybe God is
[53:30] waiting on you and I because that's
[53:32] that's the emphasis I want you to get go
[53:35] ahead number seven we believe that the
[53:44] god of history still lives today and he
[53:51] was called on the scene talking about
[53:53] that believes a child okay that's one
[53:56] he's talking about the little child in
[53:58] the Bible
[53:59] raised on up a little foot petition to
[54:01] the park we'll get that but what was he
[54:04] doing the epileptic child God has always
[54:12] wanted to do one thing I've always tried
[54:14] to preach it this way and I believe it
[54:18] he wants you to call him on the same
[54:22] that's what your prophet said what were
[54:25] they doing with the epileptic child they
[54:28] couldn't get him healed but here come
[54:31] Jesus call him on the same but are we
[54:41] afraid to call him that could be one
[54:44] thing we could be afraid I've always
[54:49] thought about living and doing in this
[54:52] form can you just turn around and think
[55:00] about him being there or would you want
[55:03] to change something if he knew he was
[55:06] coming
[55:09] you're trying to call him on the scene
[55:10] but then you want him to wait until you
[55:12] get the house plane you know what I mean
[55:14] not physically house plane this house
[55:18] are we worried about that well I don't
[55:22] know what I want him to come home now
[55:25] well then you ain't gonna go get the
[55:30] point of what I'm talking about and if
[55:34] you believe why if you believe that the
[55:37] god of history still lives today and he
[55:40] was called on the scene and the
[55:42] epileptic epilepsy left the child he was
[55:46] called on the scene he wants us ready
[55:49] don't know a little bit more on his
[55:52] promise is just as true as there ever
[55:55] was in his time that his people called
[55:58] him called on him raised him up from
[56:01] history part is written Jesus Christ the
[56:08] same yesterday today he is he's a
[56:11] historical God and he's a present tense
[56:15] God he is a historical God but he's a
[56:20] present tense god
[56:22] a historical God will do you no good I
[56:25] don't serve a God that I have to call
[56:29] him on the phone and get him to come up
[56:31] or do something no he's waiting on me
[56:34] that's the point I'm throwing us to a
[56:37] halt to see God is waiting on you and I
[56:39] to call him on the scene night listen
[56:48] there's one over in here in a minute ago
[56:50] where he's talking about this conditions
[56:52] that we're in I'll find it but he says
[56:54] says these are in other words God ain't
[56:57] counting all them things he just waiting
[56:59] on you and I to call him on this thing
[57:01] he ain't waiting on us to get good
[57:03] enough that's our point you ever talk to
[57:05] people well when I when I one when I
[57:08] quit smoking when I quit doing it I'll
[57:11] be saved then I'll get saved but I can't
[57:13] do it like this and this bad condition
[57:15] well you don't need saving then
[57:18] you know cause you're you're not a
[57:21] dependent upon nothing else you're
[57:22] thinking about your own self of
[57:23] something good come on trying to get a
[57:27] point to its own something to talk about
[57:29] go ahead he's a historical God he's a
[57:35] present tense God he is that was a
[57:40] historical God and give the promise and
[57:42] we're two people today of his pasture
[57:45] with his sheep of his row and he's
[57:46] waiting on us to stand and call him on
[57:49] the on the action call him on the scene
[57:52] watch him go in to move us watch him do
[57:55] the supreme watch him do the thing that
[57:58] man will wander and scratch his head and
[58:01] not understand
[58:02] he's the historical God and a president
[58:05] in Scott he's waiting to be called out
[58:10] of history the brother on pre-sentence
[58:13] one toddler you know raised in God from
[58:15] history you realize he's a historical
[58:19] guard to most people
[58:20] oh yeah this brother right I'm not
[58:26] throwing no stone this man right over
[58:28] here today he's preaching about a
[58:29] historical God what's the difference in
[58:34] what he's trying to do and what we're
[58:35] trying to do I'm not trying to get you
[58:38] to believe in a historical God I'm
[58:41] trying to get you to believe in a God as
[58:42] president teams right now not to come
[58:46] but he's here now if you don't get
[58:50] nothing out of the message for anything
[58:51] to me you realize that's what brother
[58:53] Dale's always tried to do for the 50
[58:56] years that I've been preaching I've
[58:57] tried to get to church to see a Living
[58:59] God what good is a dead God what good is
[59:05] a God that won't come on the scene which
[59:11] we try and see what we're trying to do
[59:13] that's my emphasis the whole point of oh
[59:15] you don't get it what we're trying to do
[59:18] is maybe get good enough you know or do
[59:23] this without of the other some deed we
[59:24] could do some idea some thought we could
[59:27] do that we'll brain God on now it
[59:30] reasoning from history raising him from
[59:35] a historical point about God Aurra point
[59:38] about your God that's not real that's
[59:43] trying to emphasize a minute to gonna
[59:45] turn my thought oh but can you turn
[59:47] around and see Jesus or do you want him
[59:51] to wait outside the door until you get
[59:53] ready to look at here or the medium what
[1:00:02] about it Church go ahead to the next one
[1:00:07] that's the eagle stirreth its nest well
[1:00:14] they don't know or what we need today is
[1:00:17] a calling together of getting ready and
[1:00:22] not dependent on the preacher right
[1:00:28] remember what weights been on on the
[1:00:30] revival part the preacher can't bring
[1:00:32] the revival well and I'm saying it just
[1:00:37] plain language you'd say if brother
[1:00:39] Branham was here today he'd bring a
[1:00:40] revival according to what he said now
[1:00:46] according to what he said
[1:00:49] he couldn't bring it when are you done
[1:00:53] oh you know now I'm just flying he's the
[1:00:56] one that said that you couldn't do it
[1:00:58] that way that the preacher can trying to
[1:01:00] revival it has to be you that brings the
[1:01:03] revival in if you're wanting a revival
[1:01:06] start doing it find out what's needed
[1:01:10] and do it might create a revival ok I'm
[1:01:14] not throwing oh I'm just making it plain
[1:01:16] cuz that's way too that I think what I'm
[1:01:20] waiting on this we'll all right but you
[1:01:26] know God's waiting on me and you come on
[1:01:33] that's my whole point
[1:01:34] make yourself ready for the coming of
[1:01:37] the Lord
[1:01:38] see but you as an individual before God
[1:01:41] make yourself ready for the coming of
[1:01:43] the Lord too
[1:01:44] escape all this corruption no matter
[1:01:46] what you call what they call you and
[1:01:48] what action they take that doesn't
[1:01:51] change god one bit
[1:01:53] God will do it just the same he's
[1:01:56] depending and waiting on us he's waiting
[1:02:00] on us that's the whole point I want the
[1:02:05] emphasis made over and over to God's
[1:02:07] waiting on us brothers that I've always
[1:02:13] just waited on the end now you know we
[1:02:16] don't how many hours how long you want
[1:02:18] them to spend where brother Bryan would
[1:02:20] even say this cell he said God was
[1:02:23] waiting on him to see what he'd do you
[1:02:26] ever heard him say that God was waiting
[1:02:30] on him see what he'd do what about me
[1:02:35] and you go to the next verse number 10
[1:02:43] and those who are resting out younger in
[1:02:46] the grave earned the altar of God as the
[1:02:48] scripture says they're crying how long
[1:02:49] Lord how long how much longer
[1:02:52] God's waited on me and you the church is
[1:02:57] waiting on me and you adoption time when
[1:03:05] God can pour into us his fullness his
[1:03:09] power his resurrection that when the
[1:03:12] church in Christ becomes so close
[1:03:14] together till Christ becomes visible
[1:03:17] among us and raises our dead and we go
[1:03:20] in the rapture fifty years I've been
[1:03:24] waiting I just ain't seen him in 50
[1:03:26] years the altar is open you need a good
[1:03:32] sagacious salvation if you ain't seen
[1:03:35] God in 50 years
[1:03:37] then God ain't in existence to you
[1:03:40] sorry that's as plain as I can be
[1:03:43] I've tried my best to get people to
[1:03:46] believe it and they don't they don't
[1:03:47] want to listen to you this message never
[1:03:51] brought a different God to me
[1:03:55] then the god I tried my best to believe
[1:03:57] because the God I tried my best to
[1:04:00] believe I seen him I worshipped him I
[1:04:05] prayed to him I believe I didn't change
[1:04:08] to another God when they come into the
[1:04:09] message change to my understanding of
[1:04:15] God was brought by the Prophet right but
[1:04:20] as far as me I believe the same God we
[1:04:23] we monitor our TV when we came into the
[1:04:27] message we thought it out the door but
[1:04:28] we monitor our TV when the kids was
[1:04:32] little they wasn't allowed to what this
[1:04:34] is 50 1950 60 earlier we wouldn't allow
[1:04:41] our kids to watch certain programs on TV
[1:04:44] and the fifties or sixties brother
[1:04:50] Branham didn't have to throw out a lot
[1:04:51] of things for us we were trying our best
[1:04:54] to live as Christians why can't we just
[1:04:59] do that that's what I've always said you
[1:05:03] see people that's messy no they're going
[1:05:04] great they're going good but then you
[1:05:06] let them backside first thing you do
[1:05:07] that will whack her hair off well the
[1:05:10] Bible tells you not to do that but
[1:05:14] around them didn't have to come to tell
[1:05:15] us these things well brother Branham
[1:05:19] come to tell us how to live well our
[1:05:22] already know how to live if he had a new
[1:05:24] birth
[1:05:28] Azusa Street had the baptism of the Holy
[1:05:30] Ghost they knowed how to live and they
[1:05:33] lived and done good may I quote brother
[1:05:36] Branham they were closer to the coming
[1:05:38] of the Lord than we are and quote it
[1:05:41] that's a quote from the Prophet who
[1:05:44] those people back tyre that lived and
[1:05:46] depended upon God and in their lives
[1:05:48] they had to because they they were
[1:05:50] digging out of living most of you never
[1:05:54] had to depend upon God we live to the
[1:05:56] point that what we planted if it wasn't
[1:05:58] raised we didn't have nothing to eat you
[1:06:03] kids and young people don't know nothing
[1:06:05] about that
[1:06:06] you got you well fires in here
[1:06:08] everything else to take care of he
[1:06:10] needed we didn't have none of that stuff
[1:06:12] I remember wrong brother tight I'm
[1:06:21] talking about it and he you know he said
[1:06:25] the eight to honey and his point was one
[1:06:32] thing you know how you poison cotton you
[1:06:36] put the cotton poisoned down into the
[1:06:38] bucket of molasses you had to have my
[1:06:43] license to be able to poison cotton then
[1:06:47] you take a little stain you make your
[1:06:48] little mop you make a little two-piece
[1:06:50] thing or something and you took that and
[1:06:52] I've done it all day long you take that
[1:06:55] and use there the cotton comes out and
[1:06:57] there's two little things like that and
[1:06:58] one it's like that you got to put that
[1:07:01] poison well what was the poison the
[1:07:04] poison was stuck together by the
[1:07:07] molasses and he said we ate the molasses
[1:07:11] that's how Porter had they ate up the
[1:07:15] molasses see that was when we was poor
[1:07:19] that we wondered what was going to get
[1:07:21] to eat with you that never been that way
[1:07:24] you don't know anything about it
[1:07:27] we come up believing God what about now

[1:08:36] the dead rising all kind of sickness

[1:09:08] time I wasn't born again well I bought
[1:09:11] it again cuz I believe profit believe
[1:09:14] what especially now you pick up some of
[1:09:20] these things that are being thrown
[1:09:22] around now and claim that with the
[1:09:23] prophets message alright listen listen
[1:09:27] are we coming here playing a game what
[1:09:32] do you been doing I'm just seriously you
[1:09:34] take what you won't do of what I've said
[1:09:36] but it's Darin ain't having to worry
[1:09:37] about it but what have you been doing
[1:09:40] for 50 years
[1:09:42] come on you older ones would you closer

[1:09:57] wouldn't God there isn't it wouldn't die
[1:10:06] cuz you're not supposed to get worse
[1:10:08] you're supposed to get closer to God
[1:10:15] yeah I believe it come on are we coming
[1:10:18] here meeting as a lodge you know are we
[1:10:23] just a spoken word church Lula Georgia
[1:10:27] the only thing we know for us for
[1:10:29] believing the word
[1:10:31] that's special way to tell you because
[1:10:33] that's what everybody said there's one
[1:10:34] thing about that church up lugol's they
[1:10:35] believe the word you know don't go up
[1:10:38] there and try to do this out of good cuz
[1:10:40] they believe the word well what else
[1:10:42] could be the greatest thing to be I
[1:10:45] count that an honor people to say you
[1:10:52] just believe the word well that's one
[1:10:56] thing about it we get the seed in the
[1:10:58] field all we doing God's got to take
[1:11:02] care of the rest of it he's got to bring
[1:11:04] it up all I've ever tried to do is
[1:11:07] preach the gospel to get it planted in
[1:11:08] you God has to quicken it I can't make
[1:11:11] him but I can at least preach it to that
[1:11:16] degree look at it are we coming here
[1:11:18] meeting as a lodge
[1:11:21] it's Christ can't come until that church
[1:11:25] is perfectly right now whose fault is it
[1:11:29] if you don't get nothing get this whose
[1:11:32] fault is it God's waiting on you and I
[1:11:37] I've got the rest of going on through
[1:11:39] here a whole lot more quotes about it
[1:11:40] but is it enough to see now that God's
[1:11:43] waiting on you and I to call him on the
[1:11:45] scene call him up from history bring him
[1:11:47] from a historical God to a reality of a
[1:11:50] Living God then we can believe him well
[1:11:58] I'm just waiting on God know God's
[1:12:01] waiting on you come on look Christ can't
[1:12:08] come until that church is perfectly
[1:12:11] right he's waiting on us I believe we're
[1:12:14] at the end he's waiting on us well I I
[1:12:21] always thought brother dealing with that
[1:12:23] was waiting on him come on the Bible
[1:12:29] says when the enemy comes in like a
[1:12:31] flood the Spirit of the Lord will raise
[1:12:34] up a standard against it so then there's
[1:12:38] got to be something causing you or God
[1:12:41] to move on the scene into our life
[1:12:43] that can build up a standard and what
[1:12:46] are we going to believe it like in the
[1:12:55] early parts of our doings we were sorry
[1:12:58] but we were just about like a good old
[1:13:00] Baptist cause in the Baptist Church we
[1:13:02] believe we're saved we hope we're safe
[1:13:04] maybe we're saved if we're it is when we
[1:13:06] was a little different from the
[1:13:07] Methodists because what the method
[1:13:09] that's done they said you're justified
[1:13:10] and sanctified and if you fell backwards
[1:13:13] you had to come back and get justified
[1:13:14] or sanctified again and all I can and we
[1:13:17] Baptists we said no we don't believe it
[1:13:19] that way no no no we we don't believe it
[1:13:22] that way we believe we're we're once
[1:13:24] saved always saved when I told him me
[1:13:27] you know what the Prophet said about it
[1:13:29] he said if they're going with the word
[1:13:30] of God I'll agree with them do you agree
[1:13:34] with it if it's right but if it ain't
[1:13:37] right
[1:13:38] well good is it new to tutor Horned God
[1:13:43] ain't waiting on you and I to put out
[1:13:46] books and tapes and run it to the world
[1:13:48] now I'll give you one in a minute here
[1:13:50] where he says we need to be missionaries
[1:13:52] all right but he's not just waiting so
[1:13:56] while he's waiting for God every time
[1:13:58] you see anybody start trying to get
[1:14:00] anything to put the word out the
[1:14:03] denominations of this message cut it off
[1:14:05] I say that without no respect you know
[1:14:09] just say it for being the truth but what
[1:14:11] about it Church God is waiting on you
[1:14:15] and I what we get is that number 11
[1:14:20] let's go to Troy over there let's get
[1:14:28] the message to the dine well we're going
[1:14:32] to send without with I'm sorry to be
[1:14:41] aggravating in arrogant and what I've
[1:14:43] talked would get the truth out of it the
[1:14:49] left don't blame everybody else
[1:14:54] I don't even blame the devil for me
[1:14:55] doing a lot of things my devil made me
[1:14:58] do it now I've done it on my own I don't
[1:15:04] even blame him for all of the problems I
[1:15:06] blame myself
[1:15:09] so if God's waiting on you and I you
[1:15:13] know it could be waiting on one person
[1:15:17] what about for wait all these preaching
[1:15:20] about a revival Nova if one person in
[1:15:22] here catches that and believes it God
[1:15:25] can make it manifest all he needs is one
[1:15:29] person now if we get a group now I like
[1:15:35] Terrance's way of doing it we talked
[1:15:38] about around here cause a lot of times
[1:15:39] you know here we're setting today we're
[1:15:40] we're down we're into the 70 or
[1:15:43] something like that class today and last
[1:15:46] week we was in the 90s or 100 or
[1:15:48] whatever and I like his way of saying
[1:15:51] things he said just leave it alone daddy
[1:15:54] say no neither building on the church
[1:15:57] because next week ain't gonna be that
[1:15:59] many here right you know we said well we
[1:16:07] got to build on Wilco we got we got
[1:16:09] enough seating in here for 110 and we
[1:16:12] got a hundred in here he said don't
[1:16:14] worry about it they'll be gone well then
[1:16:18] one of this get up and walk out and they
[1:16:21] just leave and this you know come on
[1:16:28] look let's get the message to the dying
[1:16:32] that's what I'm trying to do oh wait
[1:16:35] thou that sleepest you know what brother
[1:16:39] Ron said that was he said that was the
[1:16:41] bride in the denomination's you want
[1:16:44] that quote where it says awake thou that
[1:16:46] sleepest he said that's the bride in of
[1:16:49] the domination we ain't in no
[1:16:51] denomination we loo light when we can be
[1:16:55] a denomination just as much in Lula's
[1:16:56] all of them world fires out there are
[1:17:01] now we're not a denomination we're not
[1:17:04] like it was and went no brother biscuit
[1:17:08] and him I don't know where they change
[1:17:09] something but to come out with a how did
[1:17:11] they come up with or G or they put the
[1:17:14] daughter ordering the computer thing and
[1:17:16] this man laughing he said ain't gonna be
[1:17:19] in no organization that was the computer
[1:17:24] or RT we're we're smoking were
[1:17:27] church.com
[1:17:29] I didn't know denominations don't take
[1:17:34] for you it just takes one he said
[1:17:39] brother Dale you mean that there's
[1:17:40] people right here in this church
[1:17:42] denominations yeah because if we believe
[1:17:46] anything country to what this man has
[1:17:48] taught us we were denomination that's
[1:17:57] this plane is I can be because I believe
[1:17:59] this the man taught this is the one that
[1:18:01] taught them the Bible you know what I
[1:18:03] mean cuz I believe this is the Bible you
[1:18:08] say you got to line these two up you
[1:18:10] know you don't have to line up nothing
[1:18:11] this is the Bible what the prophets said
[1:18:14] is the word but are we gonna believe it
[1:18:17] and we'll pull it back up we'll get on
[1:18:19] to that's what the message is go go into
[1:18:26] all the world and preach the gospel
[1:18:28] you know that's could be you going down
[1:18:30] to your neighbor that's what I'm saying
[1:18:33] we're not getting and we're looking for
[1:18:35] something well we're we're doing the
[1:18:37] best we can up lutely we send so many
[1:18:39] thousands of dollars every month to
[1:18:41] missionaries I will praise God I thank
[1:18:43] God for that we have that to be able to
[1:18:45] do that
[1:18:48] but it might be your next-door neighbor
[1:18:50] that needs it might be your children
[1:18:56] that needs it that's kind of what he's
[1:19:00] talking about waiting on us
[1:19:01] the dying were wrong preach the gospel
[1:19:07] not make organizations build
[1:19:10] denominations be a big building
[1:19:12] sometimes that's all right
[1:19:13] ain't got nothing again
[1:19:15] but it ain't what Jesus said he never
[1:19:18] said go make organizations go build big
[1:19:20] churches big buildings he said preach
[1:19:23] the gospel what is the gospel the power
[1:19:27] and demonstration of the Holy Spirit
[1:19:31] aren't the gospel that's what we ought
[1:19:34] to be dealing or wanting to watch the
[1:19:37] conjunction and conjunction ties the
[1:19:39] sentence together see these signs shall
[1:19:41] follow them that believe going through
[1:19:46] the next one we got a little bit of time
[1:19:48] left there's been a dispensation of well
[1:19:54] there was a dispensation in the Mosaic
[1:19:56] law there was a dispensation of the John
[1:19:59] the Baptist
[1:20:00] there was a dispensation of Christ
[1:20:02] there's a dispensation of the church
[1:20:04] organization there's dispensation of the
[1:20:08] outpouring of the Holy Spirit I want you
[1:20:11] now as the dispensation of adoption what
[1:20:17] the world's waiting groaning that's
[1:20:20] according to Romans 8:23 right through
[1:20:23] that that the whole world is waiting on
[1:20:25] the manifestation of the sons and
[1:20:27] daughters of God I've always said if you
[1:20:34] get a fire burning you're gonna attract
[1:20:36] the attention right people gonna come
[1:20:40] see what the fires about well if we want
[1:20:43] a revival let's act like one if we want
[1:20:47] to get it closer to God let's act like
[1:20:49] we're closer to God let's live like
[1:20:51] we're closer to God let's be like we're
[1:20:53] closer to God okay sorry
[1:20:55] now the dispensation of adoption what's
[1:20:57] the world what the world's waiting
[1:20:59] groaning and when the fullness of time
[1:21:01] comes when the dispensation of the
[1:21:04] fullness of time what is the fullness of
[1:21:06] time when the Dead Rises
[1:21:08] what's the autumn of the end of all of
[1:21:09] our trauma when sickness seekers when
[1:21:12] all the earth ceases to groan the
[1:21:14] fullness of the dispensation of time
[1:21:17] what is it to be
[1:21:20] what's God waiting on you
[1:21:26] adoption time okay come on let's go
[1:21:30] ahead to the net this is the mystery
[1:21:36] what's the mystery of God's will now
[1:21:41] it's not just a little thing then it's a
[1:21:44] mystery God's will is a mystery and each
[1:21:46] man has to seek out the will of God for
[1:21:49] his or her self God's mystery the reason
[1:21:53] I brought that in is for me and you you
[1:21:54] gotta find your place okay you women you
[1:21:59] don't have to worry about preaching
[1:22:03] right come on use down through there and
[1:22:08] the people that what I wonder whether
[1:22:09] I'm call to preach or not you don't have
[1:22:11] to worry about it
[1:22:13] you know you're not called well I've got
[1:22:17] it I've got Matt name told me to go
[1:22:19] preach brother I still ain't gonna argue
[1:22:20] me right but what did he say he's saying
[1:22:25] gonna argue about it but he said it
[1:22:27] ain't according to the Bible all right
[1:22:31] so that finishes you don't have to worry
[1:22:32] about it so your sisters here to ease
[1:22:35] today the brothers have to worry right
[1:22:38] they're called to preach that's just
[1:22:41] natural story me that's just a natural
[1:22:46] point that I'm trying to get you to see
[1:22:48] the mystery of God's will is to adopt
[1:22:50] you and I into his family bringing us
[1:22:58] into the family as the children of God
[1:23:03] God's waiting on you and I adoption time
[1:23:08] when he can pour into us his fullness
[1:23:10] I'm quoting turn around and raise the
[1:23:14] day that we go in a rapture God's
[1:23:16] waiting on you and I
[1:23:24] waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:23:27] sons of God think that's what the world
[1:23:32] waiting on come on waiting on you and I
[1:23:36] garden let's go through the nation
[1:23:40] waiting on you and I'll bet it's got the
[1:23:42] whole bunch of them if you want to
[1:23:43] listen if you don't then just cut it off
[1:23:47] okay my point is is to get us to see if
[1:23:54] you don't get a point out of anything
[1:23:56] the brother branham is a firm believer
[1:23:58] in God waiting on you and I he evidently
[1:24:02] was because he does a lot of talking
[1:24:04] about it
[1:24:07] you know so evidently it's putting up on
[1:24:10] the basis of what we are okay
[1:24:15] the believers position in Christ
[1:24:18] now we're groaning waiting for that time
[1:24:21] of adoption and we believe that one of
[1:24:24] these days the Holy Spirit will move in
[1:24:26] not with a new birth while we receive
[1:24:30] that through Christ but you'll adopt
[1:24:33] your church then then she'll be cold and
[1:24:37] the power of the resurrected Lord you
[1:24:40] pray and things and pray that you'll do
[1:24:42] all that
[1:24:43] he's saying we pray that you'll adopt us
[1:24:45] now Lord into your family give us the
[1:24:49] authority that we need father to make
[1:24:52] the gainsayers keep stealing we should
[1:24:56] pray for that not pray for great gifts
[1:25:01] and signs and wonders I never pray for
[1:25:05] God I don't know one brother used to
[1:25:07] come here and then it hurt but I'm sorry
[1:25:10] but I used to tell him I said brother I
[1:25:13] pray for God not to do nothing when
[1:25:16] you're here boiling that really what do
[1:25:20] you mean brother you pray for God to not
[1:25:22] do something when I'm here I see you
[1:25:24] because you'd go out and advertise it to
[1:25:26] the world and this building to be
[1:25:28] slapped for him we got to build on two
[1:25:29] or three times but I said then you be
[1:25:33] gone you wouldn't be here
[1:25:37] you understand what I was getting at he
[1:25:40] wasn't the one to come in he just get
[1:25:42] everybody else to come he'd be gone I
[1:25:44] said I pray for God to not do anything
[1:25:46] while you're here because you've got the
[1:25:50] wrong idea I'm not trying to get you to
[1:25:52] come to this church to be anything other
[1:25:54] than one time be what God has called you
[1:25:57] to be if it's a deacon be a deacon if
[1:26:04] it's a minister be a minister if it's a
[1:26:07] housecleaner be a housecleaner
[1:26:08] whatever God has called you for do that
[1:26:12] if it's a few warmer you know I mean if
[1:26:14] there's something to said I'll do it
[1:26:19] believe it find your place your position
[1:26:34] give us the authority that we need
[1:26:37] father to make the gainsayers keep still
[1:26:45] give it to us right I'm praying now a
[1:26:51] prayer that I never prayed before I'm
[1:26:54] praying for God to move on the scene in
[1:26:57] the church at Lula in a way to either
[1:27:00] empty the building or fill it up you
[1:27:06] understand what I mean by that we had a
[1:27:10] couple of little incidents in the couple
[1:27:12] of ministers that used to be in the
[1:27:16] church here with us well I didn't tell
[1:27:20] this for a long time because it's
[1:27:22] embarrassing and I put a prayer cloth
[1:27:25] underneath where they were sitting my
[1:27:32] prayer was not to get rid of them but
[1:27:35] get them to make up their mind what they
[1:27:37] wanted to do whether they could do
[1:27:38] whatever you don't understand me I
[1:27:41] wasn't trying to get them to leave I
[1:27:42] didn't want them to leave I had no
[1:27:44] reflection to them leaving I wanted them
[1:27:46] to make up their mind with
[1:27:48] I could get in with what we were doing
[1:27:49] or get out they got out and you know
[1:27:55] what I mentioned that one time and
[1:27:58] somebody and I know it was somebody
[1:28:04] looked under that Pew and took out my
[1:28:07] prayer cloth well I just went a little
[1:28:15] further over in the seat and put one
[1:28:17] where they couldn't find a second but
[1:28:21] you know after it was over with people
[1:28:22] saying brother the hell did you put one
[1:28:24] where I'm sitting you know I make sure I
[1:28:31] took him out because I didn't want no
[1:28:33] reflection but my point was not nothing
[1:28:36] against anything I wanted those two
[1:28:38] brothers to make up their mind whether
[1:28:41] they wanted to walk in the word that we
[1:28:43] were trying to preach our to get out on
[1:28:45] her own and go that's fine no problem
[1:28:49] but I'm just saying if you want
[1:28:51] something doing after the service is
[1:28:52] over turn around look you might find
[1:28:54] something sticking underneath you but
[1:28:56] we're having problems now and I don't
[1:29:01] mean wrong problems worse Jowan
[1:29:05] all right Joe brother sister Glenn's not
[1:29:08] here today well I guess the tickle of
[1:29:10] him I look over here one time there's
[1:29:11] Joe and when I look over here large oh
[1:29:13] and when I look over here neither John
[1:29:14] win because so many people coming in and
[1:29:18] do it and they just pick the seats and
[1:29:19] that's behind well it'd be hard to try
[1:29:22] to put one under your seat brother Joe
[1:29:24] you keep moving too much
[1:29:27] all right you said well that's stealing
[1:29:31] now I want you the one thing that I've
[1:29:35] always wanted
[1:29:36] it's not a big church we could afford a
[1:29:39] big church we could call in our giving
[1:29:42] as to what we've done we could have a
[1:29:43] big church all right but we're always
[1:29:47] built on as we had to then we could have
[1:29:51] had things paid for we could do it now
[1:29:53] and how things paid for but that's not
[1:29:56] what I'm on desire is my desire is to
[1:30:00] have a people
[1:30:02] that believed Huns word and accept it
[1:30:06] for themselves and listen to what's
[1:30:11] being said of these ministers that come
[1:30:13] in I try to find ministers that are
[1:30:15] related to what I'm thinking you know
[1:30:20] the you know my joy is to try to get the
[1:30:24] people to see Christ living you know and
[1:30:26] look at the last five or six ministers
[1:30:28] that come in
[1:30:29] besides our local ministers and what
[1:30:31] they're doing look at the ministers has
[1:30:33] come in they're all been into that back
[1:30:36] to the people getting to become the word
[1:30:38] and believing it and well that's a joy
[1:30:40] in my heart I want the church to come to
[1:30:45] a place to where that they can be what
[1:30:49] God wants us to be right they don't make
[1:30:56] no difference what we are we've always
[1:30:57] just come to be what we could try to be
[1:30:59] but I want a church that this not just
[1:31:02] say it's on fire with God hey I'm a
[1:31:04] human being I'm a human being I know
[1:31:09] that's sitting in that seat gets hard on
[1:31:12] that bottom no first thing we gotta sit
[1:31:17] down an hour or hour and a half or
[1:31:19] something with us to talk and I'm a
[1:31:21] human being I realized those things I
[1:31:24] realized that the way that I preach and
[1:31:26] want to do I demand that you understand
[1:31:29] or you listen or you go home and think
[1:31:31] about it at least think about what I'm
[1:31:34] saying
[1:31:35] well what his brother Dale say it he's
[1:31:36] saying that God has depended on us I
[1:31:40] always thought I've depended on him I
[1:31:43] didn't say that I'm saying brother
[1:31:45] Branham there's the one that's saying no
[1:31:47] son that God is waiting on somebody to
[1:31:50] just to stand up and say I believe it
[1:31:55] well I ain't never seen it before don't
[1:31:58] work you might be the woman that needs
[1:32:01] to just be saying it okay all right you
[1:32:05] understand what I'm getting at
[1:32:10] not an uber we got that but an adoption
[1:32:16] okay
[1:32:17] let's see if I can find a wonder but
[1:32:22] around said I don't see nothing outside
[1:32:26] of the coming of the coming the Lord
[1:32:28] accept the readiness of the bride
[1:32:31] alright the readiness of the bride they
[1:32:35] got it up I don't see anything to hinder
[1:32:41] at this time the coming of the Lord
[1:32:44] Jesus outside of the readiness of his
[1:32:46] church he said now that's a prophecy
[1:32:50] well you know what if it's a prophecy
[1:32:52] somebody's going to fulfill it why can't
[1:32:55] we believe we're the ones that's why
[1:32:57] we're not arguing about this church over
[1:32:59] here and what they're saying today I
[1:33:00] ain't Spence
[1:33:02] let these services to try to denounce
[1:33:04] these brothers that are going this way I
[1:33:06] mention it yeah because I don't want you
[1:33:08] to get tied up into some of those things
[1:33:10] but I don't spend messages I was trying
[1:33:13] to prove that they're wrong hey if you
[1:33:16] walk away from this message you're
[1:33:18] already wrong it shouldn't be that we
[1:33:21] have to tell anybody they're wrong if a
[1:33:25] man comes out like brother wrestler man
[1:33:27] comes up and says brother Branham
[1:33:29] wouldn't Malachi forward okay we've got
[1:33:33] that soft now who is because the Bible
[1:33:38] says it's got to be well who is she
[1:33:46] didn't come find out you want to say to
[1:33:48] the person are you trying to say you're
[1:33:50] it because you say you found brother
[1:33:52] branham wrong if you find brother
[1:33:54] branham wrong then you have it in there
[1:33:55] must be closer to garden brother branham
[1:33:57] water ain't talking silly I'm talking
[1:34:01] plain language that's why I don't spend
[1:34:02] my time to onto those things let them do
[1:34:06] what they're gonna do the only thing
[1:34:10] you'll ever get me to see is that if
[1:34:12] they ever come forth and say will you
[1:34:14] sign paperwork saying this out of the
[1:34:16] other I said get out of your paperwork
[1:34:18] who do you agree with they tried to put
[1:34:21] me in Everett camp in this
[1:34:22] want to come in it when the two souls of
[1:34:25] two Lords or seven Thunder virtuous or
[1:34:27] produces the you know all the doctrines
[1:34:29] they tried to put me in the camps and it
[1:34:31] couldn't do it first sermon I preached
[1:34:32] right here in this building I'm going
[1:34:33] beyond man's camp I still believe that
[1:34:36] today let's go beyond our own thoughts
[1:34:38] and ideas of what something is and get
[1:34:40] into the message of the hour that the
[1:34:42] Prophet has already brought to us we
[1:34:44] don't need to find another message we
[1:34:45] don't need to find some other prophet we
[1:34:47] don't need somebody to straighten this
[1:34:49] prophet out we need to believe it we
[1:34:54] need to accept what he says when he says
[1:34:56] that's what you are why can't I let me
[1:34:58] at least say he said I was he's talking
[1:35:04] about me let me at least believe that
[1:35:09] because he's waiting on I've got a whole
[1:35:12] lot more in here to do it but usually
[1:35:13] gets the notes and didn't have them God
[1:35:16] is waiting on you and me adoption time
[1:35:20] when he can pour in his fullness and the
[1:35:23] baptism and curious in the resurrection
[1:35:25] and rapture
[1:35:26] alright God's been patient he's been
[1:35:31] waiting 50 years I'm just using that as
[1:35:34] an illustration back to in the Prophet
[1:35:36] left are we closer to the Lord today
[1:35:40] than we was 50 years ago if we're not
[1:35:46] we're back slid okay what you say
[1:35:50] Wednesday I ain't back to it if you
[1:35:52] ain't closer to the Lord didn't you
[1:35:54] watch 10 years ago your back fluid where
[1:35:56] you going neighbor one way Oh God kept
[1:36:00] trying to tell me some things that he
[1:36:03] but he kept telling me and he said Lord
[1:36:06] told me to go north I said praise God go
[1:36:09] north he said go to little I so good
[1:36:11] you're going north
[1:36:13] one day he come he said Lord told me to
[1:36:15] go south I said now I ain't never told
[1:36:16] you nothing ain't never said nothing
[1:36:18] contrary to what you tell me but I'm
[1:36:20] gonna tell you now you're out of the
[1:36:21] word he's what the Lord told me I said
[1:36:27] when you went the promised land
[1:36:28] according to my understanding you could
[1:36:30] go into land you could go north and
[1:36:32] south or ever which one falls on
[1:36:36] but you can't come back out and I said
[1:36:40] my emphasis is you can't go in the
[1:36:42] promised land and go back out so you're
[1:36:47] admitting yourself that you're out of
[1:36:49] the word well you didn't like them
[1:36:52] that's all I wouldn't be in dark
[1:36:54] dogmatic I was just telling the truth
[1:36:57] you can go to the this way or that way
[1:37:01] or straight ahead but you can't go
[1:37:03] backward now don't start with me to try
[1:37:06] to emphasize those things because I'm
[1:37:09] game enough to talk to you about it I
[1:37:12] know what happened with the
[1:37:13] two-and-a-half tribes that went back out
[1:37:14] but there's one thing about it they went
[1:37:16] in the land and got their possession and
[1:37:18] they fought for everybody else that was
[1:37:20] - meant for them the house to be done
[1:37:21] ain't talking about me and you you can't
[1:37:24] come into this message and back out of
[1:37:26] it you get in this message you just
[1:37:28] gotta what did he call that I never did
[1:37:30] understand it but a penny arcade's you
[1:37:33] could go in and you just look at all of
[1:37:35] the things you know we can come in this
[1:37:37] message we can come on this issue you
[1:37:38] can just look and you just got a
[1:37:40] wonderful way of going in the message to
[1:37:42] study and and read and things like that
[1:37:45] but don't try to go out of it you're
[1:37:48] going back to denominationalism go
[1:37:52] forward turn northward the Bible says
[1:37:58] brother Branham didn't go backward he
[1:38:01] went forward you can't do that
[1:38:06] but get one of my whole point one God is
[1:38:10] waiting if you don't get nothing I've
[1:38:11] emphasized them by doing all cared a
[1:38:13] little furthermore God is waiting on you
[1:38:17] and me to stand up and say who we are I
[1:38:28] would be willing ain't saying I'm gonna
[1:38:31] do it I'm not saying with others no I'm
[1:38:33] just saying I would be willing to go
[1:38:35] down to the Atlanta Constitution and
[1:38:37] print a first page and pay for the whole
[1:38:40] paper to give me every page in the paper
[1:38:42] to say I don't agree with the way these
[1:38:45] people are do
[1:38:46] and brother branham never taught no junk
[1:38:48] like that would you I'd be willing to go
[1:38:52] pay for the whole paper if they just let
[1:38:54] me have the whole paper let me just
[1:38:56] blast it but what good would it do
[1:39:02] that's just my point is I'm just showing
[1:39:04] you how much that I believe it and where
[1:39:07] did I stand on it you said well don't
[1:39:12] don't do that cuz they get them after me
[1:39:14] hey they're after us anyway don't worry
[1:39:17] about it if we're talking about
[1:39:19] yesterday or us talking about it we was
[1:39:22] you know when they click that off in
