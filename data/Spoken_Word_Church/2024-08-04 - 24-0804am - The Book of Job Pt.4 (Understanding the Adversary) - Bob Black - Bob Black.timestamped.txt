[0:01] God bless you Saints good morning we're
[0:04] going to be turning back to Job chapter
[0:08] 1 we had such a fine time at the um
[0:11] ministers meeting yesterday
[0:13] fellowshipping with other
[0:14] brothers and uh just really
[0:18] edifying and so we this morning we'll
[0:21] continue from Job chapter 1 we'll start
[0:23] about verse 6 let's just go to the Lord
[0:25] in prayer Lord Jesus we're so thankful
[0:27] Lord for your word and for the
[0:29] revelation of desire that we have Lord
[0:32] to give us overcoming power against the
[0:34] devil and Lord as we study these things
[0:36] out this morning I pray God that you'll
[0:37] help us to navigate your word and open
[0:39] these things up to us and Quicken them
[0:41] to us Lord grant it Lord that you'll
[0:43] prepare our hearts to receive what
[0:44] you've got in store for your bride today
[0:47] I pray God that you'll be with brother
[0:48] Keith as he's preparing Lord back in the
[0:50] study Grant it Lord that you'll just uh
[0:53] fill it Liberty to be with us today we
[0:55] pray in your name
[0:58] amen so
[1:00] um job
[1:04] 1:6 says there was a day when the uh
[1:07] sons of God came to present themselves
[1:09] before the
[1:10] Lord and Satan came also among
[1:15] them now I so I I want to meditate today
[1:18] on just what what Satan does because you
[1:21] know uh sometimes we we forget that sat
[1:25] Satan is real and um and brother Brandon
[1:28] would say he'd make comments like he
[1:29] you'd say Satan and demons are real
[1:33] Spiritual Beings just as angels are real
[1:36] Satan is called the devil which means
[1:38] the
[1:39] tormenter so Satan's real he's very real
[1:43] and he he's very good at his job his
[1:46] role is to torment in your in your mind
[1:49] in your spirit in your body or your soul
[1:53] if you're not born again and you think
[1:56] about what what a devil what a devil
[1:58] does it will it will influence it ta as
[2:00] an influence to to influence your
[2:02] people's thoughts or
[2:04] habits as an influence on your body to
[2:07] make you're sick to influence your
[2:11] behavior but a devil can't do something
[2:14] against your will if you're if you're
[2:16] responding in faith it can only act if
[2:20] you open up your heart the person's got
[2:24] to yield themselves to the Demon's
[2:27] influence so a Satan's influence
[2:30] manifest in unclean habits like lying or
[2:33] lusting or addictions all of those
[2:36] things are attributed to demonic
[2:38] influences that are preying on people's
[2:43] weaknesses but people have a choice
[2:46] whether to resist or give in that's why
[2:48] the scripture says resist the devil
[2:50] resist him and he'll flee from you right
[2:53] and we've got the ammunition to resist
[2:55] him faith in God's word God has given us
[2:59] the equipment to be able to resist the
[3:02] devil so while Satan's got influence
[3:05] over the world he has no power over a
[3:07] Believer who actively resist him through
[3:10] faith in God's word and you see that's
[3:13] one of the things that's revealed in the
[3:14] seals that he's just a Blu a Believer
[3:17] that's got the the new birth that's
[3:19] reacting in faith he can respond
[3:22] appropriately to the to the devil when
[3:23] the Devil comes with his Li well it's
[3:25] not for you you can't get the promise
[3:27] with his lies with his thoughts whether
[3:29] whever it might be and trying to
[3:31] influence with sickness trying to
[3:33] influence when the Mind
[3:35] battles you've got the equipment by
[3:37] faith to respond to the devil resist the
[3:39] devil and he'll flee from
[3:42] you so ultimately Satan Was Defeated at
[3:45] the Cross of Christ and he has no legal
[3:48] rights over a Believer he's just a
[3:50] squatter so that that means as a
[3:52] Believer you got a right to tell him you
[3:54] you got to you got to get out of here he
[3:56] has no right to any of your any of God's
[3:59] Property
[4:00] but he tries to deceive you into
[4:03] thinking that he's got a right to be
[4:06] there or he can't leave his his
[4:09] deception is to make people think he's
[4:11] got power over
[4:13] them so look at what what is being
[4:16] related here in job 1:6 there was a day
[4:19] when the sons of God this Angelic
[4:22] Council all all all the sons of God
[4:24] reporting back of their activities and
[4:28] here The Devil Is Right right there
[4:30] amongst them and this is this is how the
[4:33] devil likes to do cuz the devil we we
[4:36] can brother brand has has explained over
[4:38] and over that that Satan is
[4:41] religious and you know the de the world
[4:44] is
[4:45] already he's he's already got them you
[4:47] know they're in their they're in that
[4:48] state of sin but that's not really where
[4:52] the devil likes to be because he started
[4:54] as an an angel of Light and uh the
[4:57] worship angel that would lead Worship in
[5:00] heaven so he wants to
[5:02] be where there's worship so he's going
[5:06] to try to get himself just like here
[5:09] where the sons of God came to present
[5:11] themselves he was there amongst them he
[5:13] wants to get in the
[5:15] church and brother Brown would say in a
[5:17] testimoni on the sea he said that's the
[5:19] way it is it's always a mixed crowd
[5:22] Believers make Believers and unbelievers
[5:24] always conglomerated together there they
[5:27] are even when the sons of God come up
[5:30] before God in the Book of Job it says
[5:33] Satan was sitting among them when the
[5:36] sons of God appeared in the presence of
[5:38] God certainly they're always there and
[5:42] another place he said so the devil goes
[5:45] to
[5:46] church this is maybe a stum a stumbler
[5:50] to think that the devil wants to go to
[5:54] church the devil goes to church the
[5:57] devil belongs to church the devil Acts
[5:59] like a Christian he's a
[6:01] deceiver and you see what the the nature
[6:04] of that the devil is he's trying to
[6:05] deceive you to think he's got a right to
[6:07] be where to to to be there to he's got a
[6:10] right to uh your property he's got a
[6:12] right to to uh take your joy away and
[6:16] take all that he's a deceiver and that's
[6:18] what he does he deceives and he said
[6:20] brother Ram said if he didn't act like a
[6:22] Christian and act like a church he
[6:23] wouldn't be a
[6:25] deceiver no man could be deceived only
[6:27] if they the difference was black and
[6:29] white if it's contrary to one another
[6:31] but the Bible said it'd be so close that
[6:34] it would deceive the very elect if
[6:36] possible the spirit in the last days and
[6:39] he said friends we're there and again
[6:43] we're talking about this story of in job
[6:45] where the sons of God were gathered
[6:47] together and Satan was right there among
[6:50] them you know you follow you follow all
[6:52] the all the little Parables and things
[6:53] that brother R talked about that it's it
[6:55] would be so so close so close how like a
[6:58] lamb and a goat a lamb and a goat sounds
[7:02] sounds almost identical you say one's M
[7:05] and one's by well you can't hardly can't
[7:08] hardly tell it apart but but it's the
[7:11] nature that there's a nature that that
[7:13] makes makes them different different
[7:15] animals one one will give you everything
[7:17] that's got and the other as soon as you
[7:18] walk into the Barnard it wants to butt
[7:20] you and knock you over and and you're
[7:22] like well here it comes it wants to
[7:24] wants to push you over but it's the
[7:26] nature look how he said and earnestly
[7:28] contending for the faith that was once
[7:29] delivered to the Saints notice how from
[7:32] the beginning Satan has been so
[7:34] close now a lot of people say today oh
[7:37] brother brandom don't you think that
[7:38] communism is awful yes it's awful but
[7:43] that's not the Antichrist no sir Jesus
[7:45] said the Antichrist would be so close
[7:49] like the real it would deceive the very
[7:51] elect if possible it's religious people
[7:55] that's where it comes
[7:57] in and he said those Pharisees and
[7:59] religious people of that day who went
[8:01] around with these forms and made fun and
[8:03] poked fingers and said they were a bunch
[8:05] of illiterate and so forth that same
[8:08] Spirit lives on men and women
[8:13] today and look how even when the seals
[8:16] were opened brother brandom was
[8:18] initially confused about who that white
[8:20] horse rider is cuz it's so clo the white
[8:22] it's white it looks well we'll put a
[8:25] label on that and say well it's it's the
[8:27] Holy Ghost but then God revealed to him
[8:29] that's not the Holy Ghost it's going to
[8:31] be so close and look how look how we're
[8:34] examining this morning what what the
[8:36] devil does what the influ how he
[8:38] deceives and the unity of one God in one
[8:40] church he said you see Satan uses a
[8:42] man's head is
[8:45] thinking we he might think something's
[8:47] right he's using his own his own way and
[8:50] he said he chose that in the Garden of
[8:51] Eden they take a man's head is thinking
[8:53] and he has brought that down even to the
[8:56] church see the devil takes a man's head
[8:58] so he can use use his eyes and if you'll
[9:00] notice if the man isn't genuinely Born
[9:02] Again spiritual he'll take what he can
[9:04] see with his eyes the pride of life and
[9:08] he'll go many men to say he's going to
[9:10] achieve something he wants to join
[9:12] church he wants to be religious and
[9:15] he'll look around till he can find the
[9:17] biggest church he can find because man
[9:20] wants to do something big he wants to
[9:23] make a big name for
[9:25] himself that's what caral carnal foolish
[9:28] thinking man think oh if I can have my
[9:30] organization if I can only add so many
[9:32] thousands to my denomination it'll be
[9:34] the largest then in the land of its kind
[9:38] what good does that do but he thinks
[9:40] he's achieving something because he's
[9:42] adding more you see how deceptive the
[9:45] devil is to think that if we just add
[9:46] more more and more people but God wants
[9:49] people that are genuine Converse to not
[9:52] have more people but to more have more
[9:53] Born Again experience to really give
[9:55] your heart to God it's not more people
[9:58] bigger bigger churches and all those
[10:00] things we want but we want more of God
[10:02] we want more of the word I I really
[10:05] sitting there listening to brother old
[10:07] speak yesterday and he was talking about
[10:09] how there's a lot of different ways that
[10:10] we can measure the Holy Ghost you can
[10:13] measure by how how much you jump around
[10:15] or how much you uh you cry or all these
[10:18] kind of things but the way that God has
[10:20] given us to measure the Holy Ghost is by
[10:22] Revelation so that's what we're seeking
[10:24] we're seeking revelation we want we the
[10:27] more the more Holy Ghost you get the
[10:28] more revelation ation you have and that
[10:30] revelation will produce a change in your
[10:32] life and that is how you combat the
[10:35] devil when a revelation will tell will
[10:38] help you to be able to discern the true
[10:40] and the false and to be able to
[10:41] recognize and brother R would say that's
[10:43] how how you really overcome the devil is
[10:44] when you can recognize him in all of his
[10:47] tricks right right when you recognize
[10:50] well that's not God putting that thought
[10:53] in my mind or that's not God that maybe
[10:57] somebody will say something to you
[10:58] that's very very uh uh that's contrary
[11:01] to the word or whatever so let's we'll
[11:04] say this morning tell me about the devil
[11:07] I want to tell you about the devil he is
[11:10] the author of Glamour and sin and
[11:14] unbelief and doubt and pride and all
[11:17] those things that are contrary to God
[11:19] and he'll influence he's trying to
[11:21] influence people in the church in those
[11:24] ways to make you doubt and to make you
[11:27] disbelieve he pervert and imitates what
[11:30] God creates everything God will create
[11:33] something perfect and he'll pervert it
[11:35] and make it sick he'll pervert it and
[11:37] make it die he'll he'll he'll pervert it
[11:39] and make it make the real truth and
[11:42] pervert it and make it a deception he
[11:44] perverts something good and make it make
[11:45] it false pervert it and make it a lie
[11:48] he'll pervert a true church and make it
[11:50] a false Church he'll pervert a true
[11:51] religion and make it a false religion he
[11:54] is cunning and he tries to deceive even
[11:56] the elect if possible he tries
[11:59] could be so close that it would deceive
[12:01] the elect if it was possible but thank
[12:02] God it's not
[12:04] possible he is the ruler of this world's
[12:07] kingdoms and Nations and he causes all
[12:09] the wars and stries and
[12:12] immorality that's what the devil's
[12:15] doing you you think about the the devil
[12:17] is the accuser there in job he's the
[12:19] accuser of Believers he's trying to find
[12:22] a fault and Satan one of Satan's
[12:24] attributes he he just could not see that
[12:27] job was a real believer that's where
[12:29] that's where Satan got all stumbled up
[12:31] he was like if I take everything away
[12:33] from him he ain't going to believe he
[12:36] he's he's going to give away all it I'm
[12:37] going to take everything it made a deal
[12:39] with God I'm going to take everything to
[12:41] show to you that he's not going to
[12:43] really believe he's offered all these
[12:46] sacrifices and I'm going to leave him
[12:47] nothing left but the ashes of that lamb
[12:49] that he's been sacrificing and then he
[12:52] won't believe you but job proved him
[12:54] wrong right and Satan can't Satan can't
[12:57] see inside of the heart of the real
[12:59] believer look what he wants to inflict
[13:02] pain and suffering he tries to break our
[13:05] faith and and our allegiance to God
[13:07] through difficult trials but you know
[13:10] he's got limits on his power he can't do
[13:12] nothing unless God pulls back the Hedge
[13:15] and says go ahead so uh you think about
[13:18] that this morning Satan's got a leash on
[13:20] him he can't do nothing unless he's got
[13:24] permission but you know Satan is
[13:26] persistent in his attacks he'll try
[13:28] he'll try and he he then he'll he'll
[13:30] back off and he'll try again he'll keep
[13:32] coming back so you got to be you got to
[13:34] be fervent in your resistance and you
[13:37] got to know how to resist him because
[13:38] Satan is a worthy
[13:40] adversary look even after the even after
[13:42] the first wave of attacks in Jo in Job
[13:44] chapter one well here he comes back
[13:46] around again and and now now he he he
[13:48] took away all of job's possessions now J
[13:51] Job chapter 2 now he's going to start
[13:52] attacking his his body and then the rest
[13:55] of job later on he's he's attacking his
[13:57] mind and giving him all those Minds
[13:59] battle so he just keeps coming back wave
[14:01] after wave and that's how the devil does
[14:05] and his ultimate goal is to turn people
[14:07] away from God that's his that's his goal
[14:11] is to make make you think God don't love
[14:13] you make you think church is not for you
[14:16] make you think God the the promises are
[14:18] not for you and deceive you from from
[14:20] being able to to to reap the rewards of
[14:23] a Believer and his desire was for job to
[14:26] curse God to his faith and renounce his
[14:28] faith in the midst of
[14:30] suffering and look how Satan works too
[14:33] he worked through circumstances in this
[14:34] in Job chapter 1 he used Raiders and he
[14:37] used Wind and Fire and all those things
[14:41] to destroy Joe's possessions and his
[14:44] family which shows that he can work
[14:46] through natural
[14:48] means but look look how Satan attacks
[14:51] Christians he'll influence people to
[14:54] doubt the word well I I don't believe
[14:56] that Miracles are possible you you you
[14:59] see how the devil that that's the devil
[15:01] if you don't believe that God can work a
[15:03] miracle in your life it it takes Faith
[15:05] to combat that the more word you receive
[15:08] it's actually building up your faith to
[15:10] combat the devil because that's a
[15:12] demonic influence to make you think that
[15:14] that promise is not for you he tries to
[15:17] he his deception he tries to get you
[15:19] more focused on the church or or your
[15:22] pastor and develop a relationship with
[15:25] those things and get more focused on
[15:27] Church programs or entertainment or the
[15:29] chili the chili that you can eat at the
[15:31] good church function instead of a the
[15:34] spirit of God instead of a relationship
[15:36] with God and that's where the deception
[15:38] of Satan is one to some maybe he'll want
[15:40] you to try to get you to develop a a
[15:42] relationship with the church instead of
[15:44] with God and and and that's the decep
[15:47] the deceptive nature of the devil he'll
[15:50] attack with with sickness and disease
[15:52] and oppression and possession and all of
[15:55] those things to try to take away
[15:57] everything that every every everything
[15:59] from a Believer he's tries and and look
[16:01] what he'll try to do he'll try to get
[16:03] you alone try to separate try to
[16:06] separate the little sheep from the flock
[16:07] get them away get them isolated get them
[16:10] isolated so they don't go to church get
[16:11] them isolated from other believers or
[16:14] get them get them alone without Jesus
[16:17] and separate him from the word so that
[16:18] he can do like a wolf and just just kill
[16:21] him and look at what he he'll blow his
[16:23] poisonous breath of strife to try to get
[16:26] people broken up try to get homes broken
[16:29] up make make people get uh separated
[16:32] over just little differences little
[16:34] little little little tiny little things
[16:36] will come up and he'll create a great
[16:38] blow it up into a great big thing and
[16:40] and it's the devil so you want to
[16:43] overcome the devil you recognize him in
[16:45] his little tricks don't just let the
[16:47] little tiny little things blow up into a
[16:49] great big thing and then then you got a
[16:51] something that it might take you decades
[16:53] to overcome because he it's the devil
[16:56] and look here's how you know you can
[16:59] recognize that the devil is
[17:01] active when you when you deny the word
[17:05] that's the devil that's the Demonic
[17:07] influence when you say I'm not going to
[17:09] tow the line with the word or you see
[17:11] somebody not Towing the line with the
[17:13] word it's something like somebody living
[17:15] in adultery let's for example just to
[17:17] make a drastic example somebody living
[17:19] obviously they're not towing with the
[17:21] line with the word and that's because of
[17:23] a demonic influence because Satan
[17:25] influences us to to unbelieve to
[17:28] disbelieve
[17:30] sin is
[17:32] disbelief and to deny the word to deny
[17:34] the to deny any of the word to deny
[17:37] anything from the word is is a product
[17:40] of unbelief amen even something
[17:43] something is maybe is basic as Mark 16
[17:46] or that signs will follow the Believers
[17:49] if you doubt those things it's not
[17:51] coming from God right you can see Satan
[17:54] is active when you look at a church or a
[17:57] church system a denominational systems
[17:59] that compromise their teachings for
[18:01] popularity or focus on Creeds instead of
[18:04] the spirit that's what brother R laid
[18:06] out in the in as he laid out the church
[18:07] ages that nickan spirit in the early
[18:10] church age was trying to control and
[18:12] prevent the Holy Spirit from moving in
[18:14] the people it was the devil the devil to
[18:17] try to limit to try to limit the correct
[18:19] teaching of the word to try to limit the
[18:21] moving of the spirit and it was the
[18:23] deceptive power of the
[18:24] devil another way you can tell that the
[18:27] devil is active is that when you see
[18:29] immorality and wickedness increasing
[18:31] like in the days of
[18:33] Noah it just grow grows and grows but
[18:36] God's he's going to raise up a standard
[18:38] I I believe in having a standard and
[18:40] living right and doing right so that
[18:42] you're separated and you're not you're
[18:43] not living like the world a lack of
[18:46] faith for the supernatural calling of
[18:48] the devil when God moves that's a sign
[18:51] of the
[18:52] devil and and because of the Demonic
[18:55] influence people will have nervous
[18:57] breakdowns and
[18:59] unrest and unable to stand still just
[19:03] like job was roaming through the Earth
[19:05] to and fro God wants us to be rested and
[19:08] peaceful and and have know where we're
[19:10] standing and know what we believe not
[19:12] not roaming about wondering wondering
[19:14] what's real and wondering what's right
[19:16] he know God God's purpose and plan for
[19:19] our life is not to have a nervous
[19:20] breakdown or be in unrest and have to be
[19:22] dosed up in all kinds of pills and
[19:25] things you see those that's a product of
[19:27] what the de the the devil does those
[19:29] things it's the
[19:31] devil and Christianity versus idolatry
[19:34] brother R said I've seen good people and
[19:37] Pentecostal people pastors who didn't
[19:40] understand the people get into hysterics
[19:41] and fall into transes and everything
[19:43] like that and do things and finally run
[19:45] them into the insane institution and
[19:48] what was it how how does the devil
[19:49] influence somebody it's opening up their
[19:52] heart right he said it was opening up
[19:55] their
[19:56] heart innocent people and Devils came in
[20:01] and taken place there is a real
[20:05] devil let me just impress upon your mind
[20:08] this this morning that there is a real
[20:10] devil brother R will make statements
[20:12] like if you we believe there's a God but
[20:14] you if you believe if you believe God
[20:16] you got to believe there's a devil too
[20:17] cuz whether there it's true there's
[20:19] going to be that opposition there there
[20:21] is a real
[20:25] devil and Satan is the author of strife
[20:29] he's the author of marital strife and
[20:32] unfaithfulness divorce cheating on
[20:34] spouses and being dishonorable in
[20:36] marriage he's the author of all that
[20:39] substance abuse trying to pervert that
[20:41] Godly thirst that people have for God
[20:43] into drinking and smoking and and and
[20:46] and going to the gas station and getting
[20:48] all that all that marijuana oil and and
[20:50] and trying to do something to satisfy
[20:54] the holy thirst that God has given you I
[20:57] wonder sometimes if we'd really if we'd
[20:59] really get desperate before God and
[21:00] instead of satisfying that thirst with
[21:02] something else like the devil wants us
[21:05] to do but get on our knees and and be
[21:07] real men and women of God and and and
[21:09] and get get those uh those those rubbed
[21:12] mark on our on our knees in prayer and
[21:14] really spend some time alone with God
[21:17] something oh then that thirst will be
[21:21] satisfied materialism and worldliness
[21:23] focusing too much on money and status
[21:26] and Fashions and entertainment instead
[21:28] of God and division among
[21:31] Believers cuz listen Satan is real
[21:34] demonic influence is real demonic
[21:37] possession is real and brother B would
[21:39] say in Christianity versus idolatry he
[21:41] said if you don't believe there really
[21:42] is a devil you don't believe there's a
[21:46] God sure you've got to believe the
[21:49] contrary the pro and con so there is a
[21:52] real devil and he is a person not a
[21:56] thought he is a person
[21:59] there's teaching going on that says the
[22:01] devil is just an evil thought you get no
[22:03] it isn't the Devil is a
[22:07] person and then the message how can I
[22:09] overcome he said overcome means to
[22:11] recognize the devil and everyone of his
[22:15] tricks a lot of people says there ain't
[22:18] no devil it's just a thought don't you
[22:20] believe that there is a real devil he's
[22:23] just as real as you are anybody a real
[22:26] devil and you must recognize ize him
[22:28] real you must know he's a
[22:31] devil then the same time that you
[22:34] recognize him and know that he's a devil
[22:35] and he's against you then to overcome
[22:37] you must recognize that the god in you
[22:40] is greater and mightier than he is that
[22:43] the one that's in you has already
[22:45] overcome him and by his grace now listen
[22:49] to this by his grace you are more than a
[22:53] match for
[22:54] him that's real
[22:56] overcoming when you recognize
[22:59] now think now back to our story job has
[23:03] made all his sacrifices for all the sins
[23:05] of his family maybe even something that
[23:06] was overlooked he's offering that burnt
[23:08] offering and now his his sin his
[23:11] offering has been offered he's he has
[23:12] nothing left but the ashes of that
[23:15] sacrifice and he's sitting there on the
[23:17] ashes of his sacrifice and and and and
[23:20] and and you think you think all this
[23:22] time that D the devil was watching job
[23:26] the devil knew all about job
[23:30] and in Job chapter 3 he said the things
[23:33] that I fear have come upon me so job
[23:36] knew what he feared and brother Brandon
[23:38] would even say that uh he said there's
[23:42] he said I might as well be honest
[23:43] there's Satan know he said Satan just
[23:45] knows what you're a little afraid of and
[23:47] there's no need in me trying to get
[23:48] around it that even brother brandham was
[23:51] afraid you know sometimes a little bit
[23:52] fearful of of of certain cases that
[23:55] would come up epileptic cases and
[23:57] different kind of things he like the
[23:59] devil
[24:00] knows the devil knows that you think
[24:03] that Satan is a people Watcher and he's
[24:07] watching you and he's he's gathering
[24:09] information to see what you're afraid of
[24:11] and what what bothers you and and that's
[24:14] what he's going to use as a tactic
[24:16] because that's what he used as a tactic
[24:18] against job job he he knew Job was
[24:21] afraid of losing everything of losing
[24:23] his family and all the things that
[24:25] happened to him so the devil is
[24:28] constantly studying the best way to
[24:32] attack and you think this morning that
[24:34] there's there's another dimension that
[24:35] you can't see what all the all these
[24:37] activities are going on just like in job
[24:39] all this this conversation was going on
[24:42] and job was sitting down there unaware
[24:44] that people were interest that God and
[24:46] Satan were interested in
[24:50] him brother R would
[24:52] say he said Satan knows just what you're
[24:55] a little afraid of and there's no need
[24:57] in me trying to get around it in job
[25:01] 3:25 for the thing which I greatly
[25:03] feared is come upon me and that which I
[25:06] was afraid of has come upon
[25:11] me Satan knows Satan he said no matter
[25:15] how educated you are how smart you may
[25:16] be how well you may think you know the
[25:18] Bible Satan knows it just a lot better
[25:20] than you do he said Satan knows when
[25:23] you're
[25:24] bluffing but he also knows when you you
[25:28] got
[25:29] it he knows he knows when you got it and
[25:33] he knows that he's got
[25:35] limitations that he can't do one thing
[25:38] without God's
[25:40] approval you think about think about the
[25:42] attributes of of Satan that he can't do
[25:44] one thing without God's approval and
[25:46] he's got limited knowledge of the
[25:48] situation he had to ask God about job he
[25:52] had trouble grasping that job was a real
[25:54] authentic believer and job uh s Satan
[25:58] just couldn't sit still he's a RoR in
[26:00] job 1:7 and 2:2 he's going moving about
[26:03] he couldn't sit still he's going around
[26:04] examining
[26:06] things and he cannot subvert God's
[26:09] ultimate
[26:11] purposes no matter what the devil does
[26:13] God's purpose is going to be
[26:16] fulfilled and the devil is not Eternal
[26:20] so that proves that whatever Satan's
[26:22] doing it's only going to last for a
[26:24] season his testing of job had a
[26:27] beginning and an end
[26:28] showing that his actions are bound by
[26:31] time so whatever you're going through
[26:33] this morning Satan's got you in sitting
[26:36] on the ash Heep just remember this two
[26:38] shall pass and we'll stop there God
[26:41] bless you Saints
[26:42] [Applause]
