========================================
all right certainly want to say praise the Lord this morning and welcome to 2024 has arrived and uh we just thank God thank God for another year certainly thank God for his strength his grace and uh we're going to go right to financial Jubilee 10 and you can see in red fight let's say a word of prayer precious Lord we thank you this morning Father we just pray you come take control Lord have the preeminence this morning and throughout this day Lord and as we truly start this year Lord Jesus with our Sunday school lessons and the word that's going to come forth Lord everything that set for this year Lord may you have the F first place in it all bless your people speak to our hearts and strengthen us all Lord in Jesus Christ's name help me say what things you would have me to say this morning in Jesus Christ name amen praise the Lord Jesus well it's a new year and guess what we're still fighting still fighting I'm sure as you guys look back through the past year and not just in finances but in all areas of our life it is a fight this journey of life is a fight and um you know when I think of financial Jubilee you know I just want to set the stage you know I'm not trying to um make anyone Rich okay this is not a Prosperity Gospel no right but what I'm here to tell you you're already rich very different you are already rich that's the key right but there's a key to all of this all of this see we're not just rich in our finances we're rich in all areas of our life and Jubilee is about Freedom not just in your finances but in all areas of your life amen see whatever we touch in our life we can have the victory whether that's your marriage whether that's your children whether that's your adult children whether that's your parents any area of your life we can have the victory we have these promises in God's word that tell us we have this amen okay and as I prayed and I asked God Lord give me wisdom Lord what would you have me to share and this is something that's been in my my heart throughout the years you know we've been around the message a long time was born in the message so I've been there since the beginning literally since the beginning of my life so I've seen many many things in this message from people coming in people going out pastors coming in pastors going out pastors retiring new pastors coming up pastors leaving the message Pastor coming into the message all of that I've witnessed that people dying marriages being broken apart divorces everything debt bankruptcy you name it we've seen it all and many of you have seen it so you ask the question we have all these precious promises all of these precious promises if I'm saying you're rich today if I'm telling each one of you you're rich and you're like well you know but what's the part I'm not getting what's the part am I missing in this okay and the part that you're missing the key is what's in red that fight my my my see you wouldn't have to fight if there wasn't an enemy that's the problem that's why I like to tell the young people tell my kids that's the problem yes you can make your plans you could do this you could do that we can make our plans we could sit aside we can say hey we're going in this direction this is what we're going to do but there's an enemy amen my my my that changes the entire perspective that changes what we're looking at that changes this journey that's why we have to fight and as we come into 2024 that's what I want to challenge us with fighting we have to fight amen and that's it we have to pight let's go to the next slide so of course when when I talk about financial Jubilee this quote always comes with me where a prophet says clean up your lives pay your debts owe no man Jesus said get all things off your hands get everything right Make Ready Get Ready remember in the name of the Lord something is fixing to happen do we still believe that my my my we're in this hour my my my the coming of the Lord is closer than it's ever been so as we approach this year let's let's do that let's clean up our lives all areas of your lives let's clean them up if you have debt let's start paying those things off let's start listening to this word let's get everything ready by the grace of the Lord Jesus it's time now my my my let's get everything ready the coming of the Lord is closer than it's ever ever been my my my and our Prophet comes along the next quote in the message the great warrior Joshua let's go back up sorry go back up he says and I'll say come on you got something to do too God just don't poke things down your neck you've got to believe it you've got to do some fighting that's the word you're hearing it not from me you're hearing it from our Prophet that's telling us did we miss that part in this message that we got a part to do we got to do some fighting my my my you have to fight I've been fighting all my life all my life in every area of my life so we show up here we're smiling we're fighting since we moved down here we've been fighting before we moved down here we were fighting in every area of our life we've been fighting why because we have to overcome so we should look around and see everybody take a look look at each other if you think someone is not going through some problems something is wrong don't be fooled don't be tricked I don't care how happy they look I don't care how settle they look I don't care how good their marriage looks to you it doesn't matter they're fighting believe me if you are not fighting you already caught there is so much that this word has for us and none of us are there if we were there we'd be raptured out of here we would be gone so when you look around you should see soldiers brothers and sisters that's fighting if you ever think well no that brother's fine I don't need to pray for him my my my if you think your pastor is find your preacher our brother his family no pray for them amen pray pray for them pray for one another this year more than ever look and say nope that sister looks good clean but I'm sure she's fighting because she's here she goes to this church she's a Christian she's fighting she's fighting it's something she needs help on something she needs to overcome they're fighting okay and as we take that approach that would put us in the right direction that is the key to me is that we have to fight amen let's go to the next slide and the key behind it all I think some of the confusion and certainly for me certainly as I look at the journey is that we hear the word of God it's preached it's brought forth you hear something you hear something like this and this is Joshua the great warrior Joshua you can imagine him starting his ministry Joshua 15 he said there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life amen as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee boom that's how we hear the word we hear it just like that I'm in the message thank God I have arrived I got married I love my precious sweetheart I got a job it's all good from now on man I'm ready I'm excited thank you I'm a Christian my my my my my and you can take it further right we know from this church the teaching praise God you get born again we thought we had it all we had we were done wrap it up your journey is going to sit back and sail you're on the message bus for the rest of your life my you don't have to do anything find your seat get your pillow sleep we'll wake you up when you arrive it doesn't work like that come on brother it doesn't work like that at all at the end of that chapter and then shall you have good success my wow but it's a lot in between verse five and good success and that's the same thing with your marriage same thing with your finances same thing with this word of God same thing with this journey my my my so if you're ever hearing that word of God and you're hearing just that part you got to say okay wait wait a second whose part is that that's God's part you absolutely believe he's faithful he has already done his part matter of fact he has already paid the price and it wasn't easy for him as well okay it cost him something okay so now as he lays out his part when you hearing the word of God okay you got to say okay Lord that's your part you're faithful amen I truly don't have to worry about you fulfilling your part you are there right and this is the same principle in every area of your life you're going to be Victory and you're going to have victory in your marriage and your finances with your children all these things God is faithful he never not faithful amen all right but here he the whole story go to the next slide boom y right you just told me you're going to be with me you're never going to fail I'm going to be with you as I with Moses and the first thing he says be strong and of good courage well where can I get 10 ounces of Courage right man I want to buy five pounds of strength yeah it don't work like that why why you got to tell me my part you I have to be strong and I need courage no he said no let me let me repeat it just in case you didn't get that Joshua you need to be very courageous man that throws a lot of us out already like man I thought marriage is going to be just sailing through you mean I got to be courageous in my marriage yeah I thought my job was going to supply all that I need I'm never have to worry about money for the rest of my life cuz I got born again my I thought skill were just going to pile up on me I'm going to sleep I'll be a surgeon tomorrow no it doesn't work like that I'm going to be a great Carpenter after I wake up tomorrow yeah you know I'm never going to fight with my spouse never going to have an argument I'm just going to treat her the best I'm going to show youall I remember a brother got married he said hey I'm going to show you how marriage is done he was so excited I'm going to do this I'm going to do that I haven't heard him say anything like that in a long time yeah I'm going to show y'all that's what he said he showed us all right got a little quiet said welcome my brother welcome exactly courage that's what we need observe to do believe and do what the prophet has told us do not turn to the left or to the right man it's a whole bunch of restrictions coming on my part you mean I can't turn to the left to the right I have to observe you mean I got to pay attention I thought I could sleep right you know I thought I could join this message bus and sleep all the way to the Rapture wake up I'm going to have power to speak the dead back to life tomorrow yeah I don't even know how to get out of debt yeah I don't even know how to treat my spouse right I don't know what to do with my adult children do I give them love do I give them Grace or do I give them judgment what do I do M what do I do see we need a whole lot more on this journey than we ever thought we needed we need to know how to fight but he's laying out the key thank God for that word because he's given us what we need he's going to give you all the tools all the tools you need for your job for your marriage for your finances it's our job to learn how to use what he's given us he's going to give you 50 years of solid preaching in this word of God laying it out you need wood you need this but he's not going to put it together for you brother you got to pay attention we got to listen to what he's saying climb okay how do I do this okay he's not going to put it together for you right he's not going to give you the skills that you need to have a successful marriage he's not going to give you the skills you need to manage your finances right okay but he's going to tell you he's going to supply it right he going to tell you you need courage well how do I get courage okay I'm going to have to step out there where I am scared of something brother where I got a little nervousness where I got a little fear and I'm going to have to walk and overcome that right to get a little piece of courage and I'm going have to continue in that for how long for the rest of my life doing things that stretch me doing things that maybe I don't feel totally comfortable doing but I'm going have to walk a little bit in that direction that's how you get courage right man and after a while you become comfortable with that piece but guess what something is a little higher right brother amen you get a little virtue okay that's good but now you need something more so we keep climbing we keep climbing I love how brother Wade and Brother Sam always say they'd rather press on all the way praying and fighting too too and get there and said you already had it versus believing you got it and sleep right no we have to observe to do amen can't turn to the left or to the right we got to stay in the word meditate it day and night and but you just told me you're going to be with me for the rest I thought you mean I need to meditate on it day and night huh I have to observe believe and do what is in the word and then you repeat I got to be strong and of good courage don't be afraid that's a whole lot do not be dismayed don't be confused okay don't lose your courage don't be shocked Don't Be Shaken by situation there are many many turns in this road my brothers and sisters many roads many turns and we're shocked we're shocked your wife has a little bit more to say in life than you thought she had to say she got a little bit more feelings than you thought she had and your husband doesn't know as much as you thought he knew he trying to figure it out too but I thought he was going to be my daddy no he's your husband he just doesn't know you mean to tell me he's not going to ask me when he go by that boat and that 25th gun that he has huh he's not going to ask me about that he knows that bothers me huh but I thought we were supposed to be Christians and we got this all figured out my my my my and my kids oh man they going to listen to me all the way yeah right they're going to be just these little angels not my family I'm telling you they all going to sit across that road and they all going to be up here singing and just excited and wow my and they going to listen to whatever I tell them whatever I tell them they going to listen to me because I'm I've had all this wisdom so I'm so happy I can share everything with them and they're going to take it on but I thought we were Christians though I I thought we had it all WR now we do but we're missing that key that we have to fight we have to fight through this thing my my my keep that in mind my brothers and sisters we have to fight through this journey and we can overcome let's go to the next slide let's go to the next our Prophet comes along and says and so a army first and getting ready for battle first there's got to be a selected some soldiers again as I said look around we're all soldiers in this journey my brothers and sisters they've got to be dressed for fighting amen okay we know the whole armor of God we have to have that on us every single day every single day okay they've got to be trained trained for fighting you have to be trained my brothers and sisters I truly believe that's where we have missed the boat on a lot of these things from the natural to the spiritual that we have to be trained amen right you know being around this message for so long I've seen so many things amen see Brothers come in get married die young old right okay go through stress problems trying to serve the Lord okay trying to serve the Lord with all of their heart right okay and get out there get married have kids pastor's trying to say don't have so many kids so quick somebody else and have a lot of kids and then next thing you know they're in a struggle struggle brother can't come to church he has to take two jobs to take care of his family okay and now he wants a little pleasure okay so he goes out and get him a loan because he deserves it man he's been working so hard he can't hardly come to church he's stressed he's nervous but now I need to get me a loan because I need something at least want my wife to be proud of me so I'm going to get this loan I'm going to buy this house that I can't afford I'm going to go get this house I need to take care of my family I need to show for all of these years of working that I can accomplish something this is a true story and end up with so much pressure that he starts going into his basement inhaling gas and died got liver bladder cancer and died this a true story a message brother in this message that was faithful as I know he could be okay so it's not a joke this battle is very real it's not just a say so or something easy to say or light to say it's very real amen okay it's very real and it requires us to do everything we heard and to be on our knees okay that's the only way we're going to have success is be on our knees praying to God he then brings his word to us we take it on we observe day and night go into training mode that we need to be trained because we have it we have it I have the testimonies you know the testimonies where you know someone is successful in this area of their life you know someone is successful in that area of their life okay okay right sure then that is available to us amen it's available to us but everything that we heard about your part we have to take that on in truth okay and know it's that kind of battle yes I don't care how old a couple looks how they long they've been married don't ever think that couple can't separate don't ever think that they've been together for 30 years they're fine I don't need to worry about them anymore no brother pray for them that sister and that brother still have a mind they're still human okay there's still pressure in this journey so that's why we can pray for one another I don't get 40 years I've seen couples 40 years and then the wife wants to live somewhere else because she get tired of dealing with them okay and she gets a separate home and they're both still Christians both still coming to church the same message church but they're not together they can't live in the same house tired of it frustrated exhausted and tired of it Ain it brother okay so this is the same battle all of us are facing but we're getting tricked and thinking that it's not that kind of battle they're fine I don't need to pray for them no pray for everybody look at each other like Soldier you're doing good thank God you're here but hey I'm lifting you up I'm lifting you up I know the pressures of this journey because we have an enemy hey it can take you out in a battle soldiers die the war still may be one but somebody could be missing limbs somebody can be missing arms the battle is one we know that but I don't want to go out with no arms I don't want to not know how to use my weapon I want to know how to use my gun okay I heard the first thing they train you in the Army just something that they do just to kind of get you conditioned join that Army first thing they train you to do kind of day one day through that early period how to unclog your jammed gun and how to carry a dead body get your mind ready for the worst case scenario cuz this is a battle okay this is a battle and that's the same thing we have to have that type of expectation there is an enemy we are on this journey to fight okay we can pray for one another we can come together and we need training right right we need the training of the Lord to get us through that all right quickly I'm just going to run through some of these principles just to remind you about financial principles and the reason I I like these principles because I think we all can relate to them when we talk about money we can all relate to it so I like to just use that as kind of a guide a map to say man these things in the word of God if I can prove to myself that I am rich if I can prove through the word of God that I'm rich and I can see it in my life then I can take that same thing and model that in all areas of my life okay and fight my way to it because God already told me he's going to be faithful with his part he's already promised us that so he's not going to let you down okay he never lets us down we we in turn Miss what he's saying and we let it down the principles of finances that we talked about is God owns it all okay he owns it all so that's how I can tell you you're rich he owns all of it he's your father right amen is he then joint ears then are you rich so what's the problem it's not him promise you it's not him okay the 10% is his and the 90% principle number two you can't sit on the bus sleep with your finances you got to manage it diligently it is his but he's well organized trust me he knows exactly what he doing for thousands and thousands of years before the foundation of the earth knew he knew his plan I'm going to come down I'm going to die I have a BRI I have seven Church boom boom boom look how organized he is every day he can let the grass grow the fall went he is organized and we're going to make it not being come how it's impossible you will never know you're rich if you don't apply his principles you won't ever know you can have these precious promises unless you do your part Faithfully you got to manage it diligently you got to realize there is an enemy so money it can be your master it absolutely can be your master and you cannot serve God or manmen it can be your master you sleep it'll guide you it'll take you where you don't want to go believe me you will be working three or four jobs trying to pay off your debt or you'll be saying I'm not worried about it I'll pay it back when I leave or I'll leave it on my wife or I'll pass it down to my kids whatever no we shouldn't be that way right principle number four patience hey you got to wait on the Lord you got to see him work you run out there and you get ahead of him you're going to find a way the enemy will find a way for you but you have to wait on the Lord to see to see avoid Deb like the curse that's it waiting on the Lord You Will Wait so the blessing of the Lord it maketh rich and he added no sorrow with it think about it think about it no sorrow with it amen save save go to the ant he have told us he laid it out hey you're not going to be the same person when you're 75 as when you're 25 that's right tell my son hey you can take three jobs right now John you can do whatever you want to Little John you got you don't you're not married you can do 10 jobs what differ does it make you're young you got all that energy you get a little brother waade I always think about this he says you know now he has to go get out of bed in in stages I'm like man I hope I'm not feeling that but man I need about five more minutes stage one pro principle number six safe for the winter seven giving is the best investment is more blessed to gift than to receive to be able to see God work as you're giving amen and principle number eight contentment so these these were the principles of financial Jubilee that we've laid out that's been shared but that's not my word that's the word of God things that we have to help us start understanding that we're not just rich in our finances we're rich in every area of our life I love the story as I close out we remember brother R told that story of the uh the older lady and she lived in that home and you know she was living very poor and charity came down to look at her said what's going on what's going on with her you know don't you have a son isn't he taking care of of you she's like oh I don't like to bother him I don't want to bother him he you know he worked so hard in his life and I don't want to put any strain I'm okay you know and they said well does he write to her yeah he writes to me and he just sends me the prettiest pictures they're so pretty I just love to look at him say yeah I got boxes of them well let's let's see they thought maybe they write to him and say you need to do something with your mom come to find out they were money just with pictures of them from India let's say with a bear and a tiger and that's how their money looks and she was well off and didn't know it and our Prophet concludes and saying hey he says the same thing you are rich right amen we are rich my brothers and sisters we're rich in every area of our life and we're rich in the word but we got to fight we got to fight all the way until the end 2024 I said Lord help me me don't expect that this is going to be an easy Journey but always expect that if I do my part I know he's faithful with his part and I can win in Jesus name God bless you musicians can come on up
