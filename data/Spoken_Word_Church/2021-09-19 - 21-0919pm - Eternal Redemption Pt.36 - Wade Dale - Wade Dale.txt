========================================

of all the avenues and parks and where the throne's gonna be and where that the land will be the light we won't need light in the city it'll always be bright but as long as we get there that's what we need to deal with is how to get there man and all the other things will come together it will be built by your desire uh i don't see how that um me and lisa's gonna live together though because she's gonna have a sandy beach and i'm gonna have a mountain so i don't know how in the world that's gonna that's gonna get together but maybe we will i mean that's a lot you know that's what we'll be i mean if you love mountains you'll have mountains if you love sandy beaches you'll have sandy beaches so we'll let god work that out for us is that okay and he already has so don't worry about it he knew we would like beaches he knew we would like sand and some other like sand and some would like a good cool mountain stream so that was uh all part of the plan from the foundation of the world he already had it figured out all the way up all the way from when he said let there be when he said when he said let us make man in our image he began to build the city right there and that city's been built and developed in his mind all the way until it's going to be a reality just like you were in the mind of god before the foundation of the world you were already signed sealed delivered born again already made it but it was because of foreknowledge that he saw what you'd do when you got down here amen so to me that's very simple but people get it all messed up saying that we came here with all this eternal no i don't think so but anyway it's not bible the bible said we were lost okay we were lost we needed a savior we didn't need a savior then we didn't need jesus to come if we were just always this little eternal person then um we just got to make sure we get our quotes right and we get the holy ghost filter on top of those quotes to make sure that we know what god's saying to us because we can make the prophet of god we make the bible listen the bible is being preached today in thousands of other churches thousands of different ways same bible it doesn't matter if it's king james version away it's the same principle of the bible that it's being taught several thousand different ways so we can see that that even in the message that they teach the message several thousand ways but they've got to be one way one truth one life there's gotta be everything's gotta fit together nothing is out of cater god didn't send a prophet to be wrong okay now and he didn't send the bible to be wrong okay he sent his word for us to depend on it and that's what we depend on so let's go to hebrews we'll read a couple of scriptures and then we'll start right with the millennium and talk about what's going to happen during the millennium and then the battle of gog and magog and then we'll go to the white throne judgment all right so let's bow our heads heavenly father thank you for this day that you give us we pray now that you sanctify us for this journey that we're in lord thank you for the brothers and sisters that you've placed in front of us today lord be in the cream of the crop of this whole world lord we wouldn't want to be anywhere else but right here lord it's talking about you to a group of people that understands that they're the chosen lord they're the elect lady they're the bride of jesus christ but as the story was today about the armored meat packing little girl she had to accept that she had to accept the invitation to be married and lord one day thank you that you made that invitation to each one of us and we accept it and lord if there be one among us that has not accepted that invitation we pray lord that you would extend that invitation today father also we pray that you extend the invitation lord to be healed and lord to get out of all this stuff that we're in lord and that we went through it it's just part of our journey it's something to make us stronger lord i cannot believe that you'd make your children weaker by it i believe you made them stronger you've made us to where we can think clear you've made us to where we can see things maybe in a different light and lord it's all done for your honor and glory but it is for us lord we pray that you'll be with each one that's not here lord be with the ones that are on vacation or traveling the ones that are sick lord we need we ask you just bring them all together lord and you father forgive us of our sins and bless this day in jesus name amen but christ being coming high priests are good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us and let's read isaiah 65 17 for behold i create new heavens and a new earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come in to mind and then let's read matthew 25 because we're going to talk a little bit about this today this would be the judgment when the son of man shall come in his glory now remember what is the son of man it's god in human flesh who are you and i we are an extension of that we are the son of man the bride of jesus christ the son of man in the end time and it won't just be the end time it carries right on into the to the millennium all right and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divideth his sheep now it says as a shepherd it's not like he's the shepherd and he's going to choose the sheep listen we're sheep but it's as the sheep as he divides the sheep from the goats and you may be seated in the lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now we covered this morning we went through many things this morning but we want to just hone in on that now we've we've we took a bite we took a resurrection we took a body change we took a rapture we took a three and a half year uh journey on in the wedding supper and there's been a three and a half year uh preaching of the gospel by two witnesses here on the earth and there's 144 000 and two witnesses that are saved and sanctified filled with the holy ghost and they have been killed for what they believe and they're now in a rapture taking a rapture and then god's going to reign fire down on on the earth through the atomic explosion of men man is going to destroy the earth this time okay that's why there's going to think that we talk about things that will be in the millennium that will not be in the future home when god reigns his fire holy fire at the battle of gog and magog when holy fire comes it destroys souls this atomic explosion will not destroy souls it just puts those souls in another place everybody got that say amen amen because that's what's going to happen it's going to put souls in the fifth dimension or wherever god decides to put them at and they have to stay there but it does not kill them and then also there will not be the devil will still be alive and he will still have his little imps and they'll still be alive but they'll have nothing to work through they will be as we're going to read here in just a minute that he will be bound by a chain and the prophet of god told us that was a what chain of circumstances that there's no way he can work in the millennium on a group of people that are born again that are saved sanctified filled with the holy ghost whatever you want to call it i and like i said i the heathen and all these i don't understand about that i'll just tell you i do not but there's a place for everybody and we'll just let god work that out if you don't mind so let's go ahead and if you don't mind go to the where we stopped this morning let's go to where it says millennium uh brother anderson if you'll go down it'll be past quote number two it'll say chart then it says millennium talks about a thousand years is one day you're gonna be about four pages and that way will not take up too much time i i don't uh i'm gonna read we've read a lot of scripture we're still gonna read scripture but we're gonna read some quotes because brother brown puts this thing together so well for us but we were talking about this morning there at the end of the service ii peter 3 8 says beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day and continue on in genesis because like we were talking yesterday brother brown said satan hates genesis and revelations and that genesis was the c chapter of the bible so everything had its beginning in genesis so we got to go back to genesis to see that they they were told they could eat of the tree of life and live or they could eat of this tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die and we know that satan told eve says thou shalt not surely die he added one word not thou shalt not surely die all right so then that caused all the fall and all the things and the way we have to come now and thorns and thistles and briars and all those things and we were born in sorrow that's what it created but nobody ever lived a thousand years so now methuselah lived 969 years in different ones but there was nobody who lived a thousand years so now what's going to happen in the millennium as the prophet tells us and we read we take the whole of the bible and we take a whole picture of the bible and we see that that's what god was talking about the whole time is that somebody's going to live that thou a millennium there's going to be a time of peace there's going to be time of joy there's going to be a time and it's going to be that thousand years because the scent when the sin curse came on the earth this scripture couldn't be fulfilled for it i mean this scripture will be fulfilled underneath that thousand years but now man was not supposed to die if they ate of the tree of life they were supposed to live and brother brown said their youth was being renewed all the time and everything was hunky-dory and good but when they ate of this other tree now remember that day eve didn't die that day adam didn't die that day but within that thousand years they did die nobody's lived over the thousand years so now in the millennium when we get to the millennium and like i said before remember it's not to the bride i want you to understand that we're going to be there it's going to be a honeymoon we're going to have a good time we're going to have all things common we're we've already went through a body change resurrection rapture went over in another dimension somewhere and was having a good time for several years and then come back into this dimension into the millennium but listen we don't have to prove the sin curse is over we've already proved the sin curse is over listen when you get born again you've potentially destroyed the sin curse i said potentially that's the inside guy the outside guy is still caught underneath that all right but when we get the body changed it will be called out from under that and it won't matter a thousand years ten thousand years or ten million years you and i the bride of jesus christ will destroy the sin curse when those saints come up out of the ground the sin curse will be over for a gentile bride amen because you're going to call a group of people that their physical body has been laying in the earth some of them for 2 000 years and you're going to call them up and they're going to be as fresh as when they were 18 to 20 years old come on people good grief that what are you looking for we come to a place to where it didn't matter the thousand years we're eternal body spirit and soul when that happens but we're changing step over into another dimension it's done for us oh yeah there'll be a a time that we as brother dale was preaching several months ago about there is going to be a time that we're going to have to give an account for what we did do or what we didn't do right but it won't be a it won't be a cause of living a thousand years or getting to the millennium no if you're born again today you already gonna be resurrected physically if you have to you've already changed right potentially you changed the inside guy the inside guy's changed all right the outside guy's waiting on the redemption of the body all right and then we're going to go through a powerful time to where we're going to be able to stand on earth and somebody's going to stay dead come out of the ground and they're going to pull them we're going to pull them into that this dimension we're not going to have to worry about living a thousand years we've just conquered everything and through jesus christ we do it anyway but if you guess what i said if you're born again today you've conquered everything death hell grave uh you listen your soul's never sick your soul if you're born again it's never gonna die has never died never gonna die eternal doesn't need to be babied like this thing's baby it just needs to be what the word give to it as we were talking about this morning it just needs that word to be given to it the statue of a perfect man and all the things that we've been taught all of our life that's what it it feeds on it doesn't feed on anything else your soul doesn't feed on the world if it's born again your soul feeds on the word of god why i said we live a lot of most of time in our spiritual realm because we have earth that we have to deal with all right but remember that soul is a very powerful thing if we'll just let that thing loose and let it do its job all right that's our problem we haven't we haven't been where we can let it loose and let it do its job but it's it's fixing to happen we're fixing the gum to come to a stage to where we're going to either be in the word of god know what god wants and knows we know what god wants to do or we're going to be lost that's just the way it's going to be there's going to be any gray areas there's not going to be any well i didn't hear that and i didn't know that well no you did you may just not listen all right but i'm just saying this when we get to this millennium this then then for sure we can take this part of the millennium and say all right it's not anything to do with the bride it's not anything to do with the gentiles it's not anything to do with giving me eternal life it's not got anything to do with me receiving something all right it's just going to be like and it's it when you get married you get in your car or you get an airplane or you get on a boat and you go on a honeymoon usually it's about a week or ever how long you that you decide to take and it's just you and your wife and you don't send you don't tell her look we're picking beans tomorrow we're getting mad today and we're gonna pick beans tomorrow you wouldn't stay married very long at all remember that some of you that are not married yet don't take your wife on a bean picking tour all right what pamper pamper her that's what god's going to do he's going to pamper us he's going to give us a millennium to all we're going to do is just walk around go wherever we want to go we have no restrictions we have no we we're not even worried about the devil that's being bound by that chain listen he's already been destroyed in us over here he's just trying to gather up to get the other ones right because he know he can't get us when we get in a glorified body because this is the only thing he's got he's got a a dib zone or or something that he can you know claim is this thing right here well when this thing becomes glorified it never was a part of the earth in this condition you understand what i mean it is part of the earth but it's not a part of the earth in the condition that it's going to be changed into all right because there's nothing about you glorified yet except your soul all right but when you get a glorified body and you come into glorified condition you're the same as jesus christ you're the same as jesus christ satan can't touch you but see satan's going to be over here and he knows all these other ones though are still alive he's got all he's even got the come on folks the foolish virgin he's deceived them even though they're virgins he's deceived that group of people also because they're they had to die during the tribulation they had to die and they're laying in the ground somewhere and their soul is in the fifth dimension or wherever you want to say it is and they're waiting to get to the white throne judgment so satan's still got a little bit of part of them that he can play with because the only thing he can't play with is a new birth he can't play with a new birth because he can't get it it ain't for him it's god almighty and satan can't touch that once you get born again all right now he can play in your spirit realm and with your flesh but he cannot bother that soul if you're bothered today you're not born again in your soul if you're bothered by that all right i mean come on we got to get down to to the brass tacks of this thing either you're born again or you're not and then you're going to have to fit into that slot and you're either going to get the blessings are you going to get the cursings no other way around it you can't buy your way out from over this place over to this place all right you got to either be born again or not born again all right so let's all get born again and we won't have to worry about it amen just know that you know that you know that you're born again and and god's working in your life and it doesn't matter come what may it doesn't matter if the bills are coming and you can't pay them that ain't got enough to do with your soul amen your soul is eternal as god is if it's born again today so now let's start with the millennium the isaiah 65 verse 17 just scroll it up to the next one for behold i create new heavens and a new earth now what's going to happen the battle of armageddon is going to destroy everything everything's going to die there's going to be an atomic explosion between all of the people in the world the nations are going to fight each other and they're going to virtually kill each other off all right and then god's going to bring that 144 000 or or some jews down here to build that millennial temple okay but now remember that's temporary also it will be destroyed in the next battle when god reigns fire on the earth and i believe he completely cleans and wipes this place off and it all comes up new again amen everybody okay with that so what's going to happen is excuse me i create new heavens and a new earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind but let's be careful and read when we read this and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind that doesn't mean that your mind is going to be totally blank that doesn't mean you're going to get this new thought that just means the bad things you're not going to be able to remember why would you be in a glorified body and be thinking of bad things the whole deal of this is it's like russ and we were talking listen why do we get these evil thoughts that when we were even evil we didn't get these kind of thoughts amen have you ever not had one if you hadn't be careful it's coming but you have this evil thought that you don't know where in the world that thing come from well it was the old nature that you've had that satan is still out here influencing the world and just like brother branham said that time remember that he told that brother he said you were not supposed to get that thought i was supposed to get that thought remember that's what he said he told the person he said brother brown i have these bad thoughts he said well that wasn't even for you he said that was for me or or something so he said somebody stepped in the way and got that thought well you see that's how the spirit realm works it's working all the time listen the spirit realm is not asleep it's actually more active than we're active today amen because even when you're sleeping in church the spirit world it's working amen okay but be you glad and rejoice forever in that which i i create for behold i create jerusalem rejoicing and are people of joy so it's four look how many times it says jerusalem look how many times it says my people and i will rejoice in jerusalem and join my people and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her nor the voice of crying there shall be no more offense an infant of days or an old man that hath not fulfilled his days for the child shall die a hundred years old but the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed and they shall build houses and inhabit them and they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them see we've got a thousand years you think you think that's not very long but look at what if you take what we're doing today and go back 1000 years if you take what we're doing today the advancement in technology that we have today and go back a thousand years see how far it's advanced in just a human natural tree of knowledge type of of knowledge that's going what about that we have we have unlimited knowledge as the bride of jesus christ what we can do in that thousand years i believe we're going to have we you know we have creative power i believe we will brother brown said you've got enough in you right now to go create a world and go live on it in you now you can go create a world and go live on it so don't think we'll be just stuck here and we'll be twiddling our thumbs i think we'll be having a happy time amen and they shall build houses and inhabit them and they will plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof they shall not build in another inhabit they shall not plant and another eat for as the days of a tree are the days of my people and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands that shall not labor in vain now look they must be going to be doing some labor for they shall not labor in vain nor bring forth for trouble for they have the seed of the blessed of the lord and their offspring with them and it shall come to pass that before they call i will answer and while they are yet speaking i will hear like i said before there will be no praying in the millennium what are you going to pray for and pray to the one you need to talk to standing in front of you amen and let me just give you a little point here you say well that's jesus has things he that he's going to fulfill in the millennium right he has to be the son of david he has to sit on the throne ruling the 12 tribes of israel like i said before ruling with a rod of iron and and being the judge and all these different things so he's running a kingdom so you and i though as the bride of jesus christ i believe the people on the earth in the millennium at that time is going to know that we are mrs jesus christ and they'll want to talk to us and they'll want to ask us questions they'll want to get knowledge from me and you knowing that we're that we're not jesus christ but we're a part of jesus christ so much in that we're the same person and we'll have the same thoughts so when i see this and it shall come to pass before they call i will answer now why can't that be for me and you we're not going to just be sitting twiddling our thumbs we're going to be active we're going to be doing things the wolf and the lamb shall feed together because listen you're getting a part of it now when you get a revelation what do you get where are you getting it from where do you get revelation from the devil no you get true revelation from god and it's straight from god it's not in a second person it's god communicating with you personally so what do you think in the millennium that's going to be the same thing when all this look when all this sin barrier and all this all this um adamic nature and all this uh half of me having the mind of christ and the other having the mind of the devil hello somebody but when we get in the millennium it's not gonna be half and half we will have the mind of christ so we'll think exactly like he does we'll be able to answer exactly like adam did when adam named the animals and moved the mountains and moved the trees and god never said no adam you made a mistake he said no that's exactly what i was thinking adam and that's what's going to happen in the millennium so it's not just going to be jesus sitting on a big throne and and then you know people coming up and he's the only one now it's okay he is the son of david he is going to be the one that rules that because he's ruling israel at the time but we're going to be thousands millions of brides going to be all over the world walking around and doing things in the temple talking to people i believe we'll be able to teach people because if there is a fifth sealed jew or somebody like that that's raised up in the millennium or the heathen what better for me and you to talk to them and tell them about redemption tell about how they got there they might just appear somewhere and they don't know how they got there well you can tell them how they got there the wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock and thus shall be the serpent's meat that shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain saith the lord let's go to isaiah 66 22 this is where we stopped it today this morning for as the new heavens and the new earth which i will make shall remain before me saith the lord so shall your seed and your name remain now watch and it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another one new moon a calendar 30 days because see they got they got to live a thousand years of natural time so there's going to be days and nights and there's going to be months and years a thousand of them and it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another and from one what sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worship before me saith the lord and they shall go forth and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me for the worm shall not die neither shall their fire be quenched and like i said before i don't know how you interpret that but i mean when we come back in the millennium if it was an atomic fire you never know what you're going to see because remember see it's not a cleansing of the earth for god and to be a holy place for him to be per se like it's going to be in the future home because the atomic fire is not going to destroy everything obviously we got to have trees to build for them to build the tabernacle with there's going to have to be iron and steel and ore and different things and a certain kind of economy in the millennium but see not in the future home see the way i see it is is we we're we live in this world here this is our world that we communicate with and we live here and we do we drive cars and we work and we do this and we go to school and we do all this stuff then now when that cleansing happens and we step into the millennium it's not don't get me wrong it's not so much that we have we can we can we say well we've lived here then the next stepping stone is going to be the millennium which is a little bit like this but a little bit more like this then we're going to step into the future home which is nothing like any of that and i thank god because see it's not just an instant thing we're going to be we know we've been humans we know we lived in flesh we knew we we know we had an economy we know that those things happen we we know that the bible tells us they're going to have to build houses and them inhabit then when we step into the millennium then we're there and we've got more of the mind of christ but we know that we're still we were humans in human flesh and then when we step over into the future home all that's going to be done away with but the filter of our mind we're still going to remember brother brown said you'll still remember who you were married to you'll still remember who your children were and what in the world are we going to talk about we're going to talk about the time we had while we were on the earth but not the bad stuff it'll be all the good things all right so you never know you may be able to see this and they shall be in the pouring unto all flesh all right let's continue on isaiah 2 verse 1. the word of isaiah the son of a moose saw concerning judah in jerusalem and it shall come to pass in the last days that the mountain of the lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains remember what's going to happen the mount of olives have you seen the melamine it's not very high is it brother rush has been in jerusalem several times but it's not very high but it's still a mountain the bible says it'll cleave one side to the other and the city will push up now listen you can take that as a city over here and you can take that as a city over here because where they're going to build that mountain at i mean where they're going to build that city it's on top of a mountain and shall be exalted above the hills and all nations look nations there's got to be nations all nations shall flow unto it and many people shall go and say come ye and let us go up to the mountain of the lord to the house of the god of jacob and he will teach us now let's go back to that he if she is him then that he is part of you you'll be able to teach the world what you know and he will teach us of his ways and we will walk in his path for out of zion shall go forth the law and the word of the lord from jerusalem and he shall judge among the nations and shall rebuke many people and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks nations shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall they learn war anymore so it looks like there's going to be an economy looks like there's going to be nations looks like they're going to be something that they shall rebuke many people maybe get out of line a little bit i don't know that's what i mean you've got an imperfect world that we're going to do away with but we're coming right back and we're going to live in a millennium which is still got the devil still alive which still he's going to be raised up to do his thing and you still got people physically building houses and physically laboring and there's a nation nations and there's swords and plowshares and spears and pruning hooks but see when you get over into that future home none of that's coming none of that's gonna come into the future home we're not gonna have to get over in the future home and go now you need to take that you need to take that spear and make a no there won't be no spear but they still will have an economy because remember the kings of the earth bring their glory into the city and present it and get a leaf off the tree of life and walk out so there's got to be kings so there must be a kingdom an economy maybe you might say there's got to be some kind of hierarchy or you just have no kings amen all right so let's read now jeremiah 33 verse 10 thus saith the lord again there shall be heard in this place which you say shall be desolate without man and without beast now something's going to be heard that something is desolate then it's going to be heard even in the cities of judah and in the streets of the of jerusalem that are desolate without man and without inhabitant and without beast now you're going to hear something because all this at the battle of armageddon is going to be empty okay the battle of armageddon this is all going to be empty everybody's going to die there's going to have to be somebody reappear and give this look the voice of joy and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride now israel's not the bride we are so when we come back into the millennium we're going to come back and the voice is going to be heard the voice of them that shall say praise the lord of host for the lord is good for his mercy endureth forever and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the lord they bring the sacrifice of praise listen there's not going to be sacrifices like bullocks and stuff like that but it's a sacrifice of praise into the house of the lord where are we going to be we're going to be in the house of the lord all right what did i get for i will cause to return the captivity of the land as at the first saith the lord thus saith the lord of hosts again in this place which is desolate without man and without beast and in all the cities thereof shall be in habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down there's your economy and you can take that spiritually that's okay but that i'm talk listen this is talking about a natural place this is not spiritualizing anything this is the natural place that's gonna happen all right in the cities of the mountains in the cities of the vale so there must not going to be just one city they're going to build cities and inhabit them in the millennium in the cities of the vale and in the cities of the south in the land of benjamin and in the places about jerusalem and in the cities of judah shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth them saith the lord wow going back to old times i guess in those days and at that time will i cause the branch jesus christ we know of righteousness to grow up unto david and he shall what execute judgment and righteousness in the land there's that son of david sitting on the throne executing judgment and righteousness for thus saith the lord david shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of israel there's your son of david prophecy that god will never take a man off and who is this david the david is the branch david's not the real david the real david's not going to be sitting on the throne it's going to be the son of david which is jesus christ the promised son to sit on the throne and look david shall never want a man to sin upon the throne of the house of israel or the domain of israel everybody got that say ma'am all right well y'all real sleepy today bob we're gonna have to we're gonna have to stand up and hire hiya i know this has been long it's been 35 sermons but we're coming to an end if it bores you then you need the holy ghost any word of god bores you you need the baptism of the holy ghost if somebody just reads you scripture you ought to get something all right so now let's go to let's read revelations 20 verse one and i saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand now this is going to have to happen sometime after the battle of armageddon i don't know when don't know where to put it into place but it has to be before the millennium begins because he's going to be bound 1 000 years everybody got that so sometime after the battle of armageddon something's going to happen to the satan they're going to somebody's going to the angel is going to bind him in the bottomless pit with a great chain now remember young adults kids old adults it's not a chain it's not a log chain it's a chain the prophet of god said a chain of circumstances because he can't work in a group of people that don't have any part of him that he's not part of anybody and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and satan and bound him a thousand years and cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and put a seal on him that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years should be finished and after that he must be loosed a little season he's going to give the devil one more opportunity it's just one more because he's fixing to be cast into the lake of fire and i saw thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them judgment was given unto who us them the bride and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of jesus he talked about us for the word of god and which had not worshipped the beast remember everybody that worshiped that didn't worship the beast had the seal of god which is the baptism of the holy ghost all right so now which had not worshiped the beast neither his image neither had received his mark on his in their forehead because remember you receive the mark of the beast you're going to have to come to go to judgment you're going to have to be judged for what you've got in your mind because you didn't have it cleaned out by the baptism of the holy ghost i mean look this group of people right here is the bride down through the church ages beheaded for the witness of jesus christ and for the word of god which didn't worship the beast that's now neither his image neither had received his mark upon their forehead that's now or in their hands and they lived and reigned with christ a thousand years remember only the bride 144 000 that i can put into a group is going to be able to do that but the rest of the dead live not again now whoever died in the battle of armageddon is going to have to stay dead for a thousand years more but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection what is the first resurrection the resurrection of the saints which the second death has no part blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection look on such the second death hath no power what is the second death white throne judgment second death is white throne judgment all right on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priest of god and of christ and shall reign look reign with him a thousand years right so there's your point that i want to make it reign with him for a thousand years not that he's just raining and we're just kind of walking and i do make a point that it's it's well there's a honeymoon but like i said before we're not just gonna sit there like zombies all for a thousand years no we're gonna have things to do we're going to rule and reign with him a thousand years i like to think of it as when moses was standing there and and jethro said moses and man said there's way too much on you sid said you need some help and so god took the spirit of moses right the spirit that was on moses and divided it among 70 people so they can judge the smaller matters of the earth well that's the same way with god he's going to allow the judgment to be with all of us listen if we judge angels and we going to judge the earth a thousand years from now why can't we do some judging in the millennium luke 1 verse 31. and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name jesus now this is gabriel in front of mary he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david there's the promise and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end now what is the kingdom of god the baptism of the holy ghost which is us all right so there's and there's the promise of having someone on the throne father david which is the son of son of the highest and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end let's go to jeremiah 23 verse 5 behold the days come saith the lord that i will raise unto david a righteous branch a king shall reign and prosper and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth he's talking about the millennium in his day judas shall be saved so it can't be now judah shall be saved and israel shall dwell safely that ain't happening now i promise you that and this is his name whereby he shall be called the lord of righteousness therefore behold the days come saith the lord that they shall no more say the lord liveth which brought up the children of israel out of the land of egypt but the lord liveth which brought up in which led the seed of the house of israel out of the north country and from all the countries and what's the north country russia where did a lot of the jews come from they come out of russia they were driven out of russia actually millions of them all right and from all countries whether i had driven them so he drove them out we don't been through that before and they shall dwell in their own land so they're back into the homeland now getting ready for this now listen let's go to number three this is going to brother branham is going to tell us he's going to get about the millennium so time never ceased until the this must be a post-millennialist or something that asked the question because see we got a thousand years after the church has gone home and comes back upon the earth then time ceases in the new heaven and the earth now the millennium is not the new heaven and new earth all right you got that even though we read in isaiah where it says i create new heavens and a new earth okay now the millennium is not the new heavens and the new earth there will still be sin after the millennium because the devil's going to be alive the imps or the the spirits are going to still be alive and then the sinners are going to have to come up out of the grave and give an account of what they did so sin is going to be there the whole time there will still be sin after the millennium the millennium is a type of noah going into the ark and carried over and brought ham in them on the other side and sin even came out of the ark we know that came through ham right but enoch the translated one was a type of the bride that went up not the one that was carried over so sin will still be on the other side of the millennium but not during the millennium right because it's going out to be loosed after the thousand years during the millennium is peace see but sin will be dealt with the other side of the millennium and then time fades out let's go to number four questions and answers same thing so let me ask you another question where is that one that's going to sow that seed for that end time church where is that ripening seed that promised elijah and immediately after his days shall the great tribulation set in and burn the earth he's talking about himself and then at the return of the church and the bride the bride in christ shall walk out upon their ashes in the millennium now they're not going to walk out there's a doctrine in the in the message that we're going to walk out on our own ashes in other words our bodies going to be burnt we're going to have a new one somewhere else and we're going to step into this new one and walk out because if you look if you if you read that different and then at the return of the church and the bride the bride in christ shall walk out upon their ashes now if you read it like that you pretty much see that brother branham is saying they're going to walk out on their own ashes but that's not true no he's going to walk out over the ashes of all the other people that died on the earth because you're going to be in a glorified body and it's going to be your flesh body there's not another one laying somewhere when the earth is purified by fire and there they shall reign and the heathens look this never heard the gospel shall be raised at that time i'm just reading the quote and the sons of god will be manifested if he's to reign he's got to have something to reign over he's got a dominion he said and they ruled and reigned with christ and christ ruled with the rod of iron the nations then the gospel then the manifested sons of god look with the authority just like he had when he was here there'll come the millennium in that rain upon the ashes let's go to number five this is the sixth seal in the time of the millennium it's israel that's a nation the 12 tribes is a nation but the bride is in the palace she's a queen now she's married and all of the earth shall come into this city jerusalem and shall bring the glory of it in there and the gates will not be shut by night because there won't be any night in the city the gates will always be open the kings of the earth now look brother adam takes that same scripture that's supposed to be for the future home and he's putting it into this scripture for the millennium because he's already in revelations 22 that's not the millennium that's the future home right bring their honor and glory into this city but the bride is in there with the lamb oh my do you see it in there not the bride isn't going to be out here laboring in the vineyards now he's back where he's in the millennium no sir she's the bride she's the queen of the king it's the others that labor out there the nation not the bride amen so let's go to the next one future home now perfectly noah was the type of those carried over remember when noah came out ham was with him sin was still in there sin went right on over through the ark unbelief doubt went over in the ark went higher than the ark but enoch went higher than the ark he went on into the presence of god but noah went through and came out and there was still sin top of the millennium of the world's condition the millennium is not the end of it there will still be time after the millennium because the white throne judgment can't be an eternity because you got time elements you've got sinners standing there and they're not eternal so you got centers standing there that's still in time all right there will still be time after the millennium the millennium is a space of time but not the new earth look at the capital letter not the new earth no indeed noticed in that we'll get to that after a bit now he's in the future home number seven the future home and notice not the perfect world this millennium you got it not the perfect world this millennium it's the type of the seventh day remember seventh day is what it's not the eighth day eighth day is eternity seventh day still in time so the millennium is still in time then comes the white throne judgment see we still have judgment we're still in time in the millennium it's a day one thousand years it's a time element not don't get that mixed up with the new earth now because it's not so nice read revelations 20 verse 7 and when the thousand years are expired satan shall be loosed out of his prison and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth gog and magog to gather them together to battle and the number of whom is as the sands sand of the sea and they went up on the breath of the earth and compassed the camp of the saints about trying one more time they try one more time to defeat the bride or defeat the sainted ones and the beloved city and fire came down from god out of heaven and devoured them and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet already are and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever not for an eternity though now that's forever and forever now let's read number eight questions and answers 1963 would you please explain how satan is bound a thousand years being loosed again for the battle of revelations 20 and 8. that is not the battle of armageddon because that's the battle of gog and magog there's two different battles totally and they totally have different outcomes all right this is not the battle of armageddon the battle of armageddon takes place on this side what this side of what when the tribulation period ends all right the battle of armageddon takes over when the tribulation period has ended and now what relations does this have with the battle of gog and magog none because it's not on this side the battle of gog and magog is on the other side okay everybody got that one is this thousand years and the other is on the end of the thousand years as mentioned in the fourth seal will god he's answering pieces of questions i've got them all read but these are pieces of question this is a question right here as mentioned in the fourth seal will gog and magog be gathered from people on the new earth satan was loosed out of his prison and went together all the people the wicked to bring them to this place and god rained fire and brimstone out of heaven and they were consumed two battles all together so everybody got that all right so now let's go to revelations 20 verse four and i saw thrones and they sat upon them now we see thrones again and judgment was given unto them this is what we read a minute ago i saw the souls of them will be headed but we're going to continue on a little bit further which had not worshipped the beast neither his image neither had received his mark on the forehead or in their hands they lived and reigned with christ a thousand years but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection all right blessed and holy see we didn't read that we stopped right there last time but let's go to verse six blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power no we did read this but they shall be priests of god in christ and shall reign with him a thousand years now so thousand years after that millennium is over then you're going to have what you're going to have the white throne judgment all right everybody with me hang on just a little bit longer put you an oxygen mask on or something start sucking some air some of you like you're dead daniel 7 verse 9 and i beheld till the thrones were cast down and the ancient of days did sit now remember daniel's commentary in revelations is the same basically he has a jewish angle and revelations has a gentile angle everybody got that okay a jewish angle and a gentile angle so this is the jewish angle he's the ancient of days whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like pure wool remember brother brown had a question about that and the angel the lord told him about the white wigged one that it was like the old people over in britain you watch them they put the white wigs on it shows judgment and it shows where they could come into court and the strong was like the fiery flame in his wheels as burning fire a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him thousand thousands ministered unto him and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him now look thousands times thousands ministered unto him that's the bride and tens times ten 000 stood before him the judgment was set and the books were open i beheld them because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake i beheld even till the beast was slain and his body destroyed and given to the burning flame as concerning the rest of the beast they had their dominion taken away yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time we'll not get into that that's a long process to talk about but it is pretty interesting i saw in the night vision and behold now remember this is daniel jewish angle this is daniel behold one like the son of man come with clouds of heaven and came to the ancient of days and they brought him near before him and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all people nations and languages should serve him coming unto the son of david his dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed now that's the jewish angle to that same thing same thing is going to happen there's a judgment there's a son of david that's going to sit on the throne in the millennium then you've got an everlasting dominion right here so let's go to revelations 20 verse 11 through 15. and i saw a great white throne in him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were opened and another book was open which is the book of life remember there's not going to be a whole bunch of books there remember i preached to you a long time ago called the book of books you're written epistles people said i can read you like a book you're like it your life is an open book so it's not going to be books they're going to be the book the people and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were open and another book was open which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works you don't ever want to stand before god according to your own works never but now remember though they're judged and some people aren't given eternal life because of their works but i don't want to be there i'll forget something i want to be i want to have that taken care of now to where i don't stand before that i stand at the judgment not in judgment all right according to their works and the sea gave up the dead which were entered in death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them see everybody anybody that ever had breath is going to go to the white throne judgment except the bride of jesus christ all right now i don't understand about um you know all the babies he says all babies go to heaven i don't know if they automatically go to heaven or they have to i mean what are they going to be judged by they can't be judged unless they get to the age of accountability so there's no way to judge them so i don't know if they just automatically going in but i thank god for a prophet that said all babies go to heaven okay and the age of accountability we know 12 14 years old somewhere in there when you can realize that you have sinned and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire there's a group of people folks that's not even in the book they're just dead they're just sinners they're not their works is not even going to be worth anything i mean why would you why would you want to i know they're going to they're all going to be judged but remember there's parts of the book that you can be transferred names can be transferred over and some can be erased out like judas can be erased out but there's a group of people it's just going to be they're just sinners and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire all right let's go to number nine questions and answers jeffersonville 1954. look at this morning's lesson when the judgment was set the books were open now jesus came with 10 000 times 10 000 of saints and then the judgment was set here they all are around the white throne judgment as we went through the scripture with it and the books were opened and another book was open which was the book of life and these in the rapture was judging them the bride and these in because who only takes the rapture only the bride takes the rapture all right not the foolish virgin now the 144 000 take their separate rapture but it's not the first resurrection everybody got that everybody got that okay and these in the rapture was judging them is that right them had done went home and received their glorified bodies and lived through the millennium was hearing the white throne judgment judging those and he said he would separate the sheep from the goats so let's go to matthew 25 31 when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered on nations and he shall separate them one from another as as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats because remember they're not sheep we're sheep but he's doing it as a shepherd would divide the sheep from the goat and he shall set the sheep on his right side but the goats on the left then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come you blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared from you for you from the foundation of the world for i was a hunger then you gave me meat i was thirsty and you gave me drink now look that's not the bride that's the somebody that did this to the bride because remember that i when i i was hungered it's me and you that's the cup of water in my name that's the change in your tire on the side of the road that's the opening the door for you and and you know helping you out in things for i was hungry then you gave me meat i was thirsty you gave me drink i was a stranger and you took me in naked and you clothed me i was sick and you visited me i was in prison and you came unto me then shall the righteous answer him saying when saw we the hungered and fed thee are thirsty and gave thee drink when saw we thee a stranger and took the in or naked and clothed them or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee listen they had no idea what they were doing so it can't be the bride the bride don't get a cup of water i mean they receive it but they're not the ones that give it all right you don't get eternal life and be called bride just giving a cup of water to somebody no you have to be born again all right these people were not born again because they're at the white throne judgment being judged so there's no way their bride and the king shall answer and say unto them verily i say unto you in as much as you have done it unto one of the least he says of these brethren so he must be pointing to all the people standing around him and as much as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren you have done it unto me then shall he say also unto them on the left side depart from me you cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels for i was a hundred and you gave me no meat i was thirsty and you gave me no drink i was a stranger and you took me not in naked and you clothed me not sick and in prison and you visited me not then shall they also answer him saying lord when saw we thee hungered or thirst or strange or naked or sick or in prison did not minister unto thee then shall he answer and say verily i say unto you inasmuch as you did not to one of the least of these you did it not to me and these shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous into life eternal wow because you did it to the least of my little ones because they're sitting there going we never saw you lord we never saw you physically we see you now we we've never saw your person he said no but you did it to this person right here you did it to this person right here you did it to one of these least of my little ones you did it to this person and he'll point them out and they'll go oh yeah i changed that one's tire one day or i helped that one do this one day or i gave them some money one day or this and that and the other okay so the white throne judgment is going to be a bad time but it's going to be a time though that where i see grace at its apex grace at its apex to give eternal life to somebody that just gave a cup of water to you without any strings attached he's going to be given eternal life and he's going to be told who it was and he's going to realize that because of you he got eternal life all right let's go to matthew 7 verse 21 not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day white throne judgment lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and that i name thy name have done many wonderful works and then will i profess unto them i never knew you now if you look that word new up k-n-e-w that is the same relationship as it would be when adam and eve got together and had children all right i never knew you in other words i never had an intimate relationship with you all right depart from you me you that work iniquity all right let's go to first corinthians two verse nine we'll finish up here in just a second but as it is written i have not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god has prepared for them that love him but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit that's what he's doing now for the spirit searches all things yea the deep things of god all right let's go to revelations 21 verse 1. this is the last scripture and you can take this scripture and go on to revelations 22 and you can read about the avenues and the parts and read the future home and i'll just let you do that and i saw a new heaven and a new earth now it didn't say new heavens it's in new heaven i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away now remember brother brown brought that out passed away was that long word that he couldn't pronounce a neon or whatever that is which meant not to annihilate but to burn over so he's not going to ever destroy the core of the earth he's going to destroy the framework of the earth he's just going to destroy everything around the earth and as far as man went down as far as went to mars and all the different places all right and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem look coming down out of heaven now the millennium it didn't say that it was coming down they said they built the houses while they were here all right so this is after the battle of gog and magog this is after god's done killed all the all the evil and everybody's went to their place everlasting punishment everlasting life here comes a city and i john saw the holy city in new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband because it is the bride and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god no more separation and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold i make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end i will give unto him that is the thirst of the fountain of water of life freely and you know in the bible there's seven church ages and there's seven overcomings and each there's a church age that has an overcoming in every age right so that's seven there's an eighth one there's an eighth which puts you into eternity okay he that overcometh shall inherit all things boy that to me that's just that lays it out that that that what that brother says that explains everything if god tells you that you have inherited all things he means all things amen and i will be his god and he shall be my son but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and the murderers whoremongers sorcerers idolaters liars shall have their part in the lake of burning with fire and brimstone which is the second death and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven left plagues and talked to me saying look come hither i will show thee the bride the lamb's wife i'm gonna read you one more quote i read it a long time ago they don't have it back there but if some questions and answers brother brown said the church ages ended or the question is the church ages ended and blacked out the bride is called we have already entered in the tribulation no no no i wish that i could have more time on that the bride when she's taken from the church this is the order of events that'll take us to where we're going the bride when she's taken from the church then the church age will cease laodicea goes into chaos the bride goes to glory and the tribulation period sets in upon the sleeping virgin for three and a half years while israel is getting this prophecy then tribulation sets in upon israel we've uncovered all this and then comes the battle of armageddon which destroys all things and then the bride returns back with the groom for a thousand years the millennium reign after that comes the white throne judgment after that comes the new heaven and new earth and the new city coming down from god out of heaven eternity and time blends together eternity and time that's what we're looking for folks eternity and time blends together that word eternity oh yeah we're sitting in heaven places and all this but we still got to go to work tomorrow we still got to do the things but now when we come to this new city behold i make all things new he that overcometh will get all things and when he said it was finished it is done he said it was it is finished at calvary he said it is done what when you do something and get it done it's done and god said it's done but you know what you you take that and you think man then this it's just done no that begins that begins your eternal destination from the future home all the way for an eternity when he said it's done he means all the other things the bible has been fulfilled because see where revelations 22 the bible he's saying it is done everything's been fulfilled everybody is in the place they're supposed to be in the devil's done away with the the all the dimensions are emptied up and the ones that are going to burn for forever they're already where they're supposed to be the bride is where she's supposed to be there's going to be a city come down we're going to live in the city and then all the other people is going to live on this earth around about see the people can come into the sitting but they got to leave so you come visit me that's fine but at a point in time you gotta leave because it's my house right that's the same way with the future home that future home is the bride's house not a millennium not of this or that or the other that's my house you can come and visit me now i'm gonna talk about y'all i'm talking about the foolish virgin the cup of water in my name the children that are given eternal life people that are giving an eternal life they're gonna have to live on the outside of that city and there will be an economy there i don't know if they're gonna plant stuff and bring it in but i like what brother claude said because in the economy that's set up if you take and and make your crops you bring a tenth of that crop in as a tithe and you can if you've got 10 billion people on the outside of the city and only 1 billion on the inside those 10 billion can give 10 of what they produce and it'll you know we're not going to need that but still it'd be nice i like beans and i like taters i like squash okra tomatoes um right and we're not going to do away with that i don't think i i think the the bible says the trees are going to draw have 12 manners of fruit why would it do 12 different kinds of fruit because it's a variety it's a variety god's got this thing all set up for us but we're going to have to live through it it's going to be part of our it's got to be part of our journey amen so let's stand to our feet god bless you well uh brother joe we'll sing a couple of songs and then we'll uh then we'll uh talk about the uh next weekend all right but thank you for being a part of this and listening because without you we're just talking to the wall sometimes it feels like we're just talking to the wall anyway but we're going to listen folks we're going to make it we're going to make it how you know that well the bible's already told us we're going to make it you got to believe what the bible says the bible says about the bride of jesus christ she will make it she'll be him made manifest on this earth again as the bride in the future home it'll be our house the place god fixed for me and you whatever trial and tribulation you got down here is nothing compared to what you're going to get just keep your eyes on that city let's sing a song i'll sing that course all this well all is well all live for we have heard the message and all is oh there is a place a perfect breakfast behind me little bright rest for all is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] oh there is a place a perfect rest behind one more time if you have a name oh can you say that today yeah [Music] heard the message alone and all is there is a [Music] little bright rest for all is well you know there's not even going to be this the future home we're not going we're not going to have daylight and dark he said the lamb would be the light you read it we won't have day or night in that city and lights always be on but you know what they're gonna there's gonna be one thing missing and that's the tabernacle it won't have a need for a tabernacle you and i the bible says the tabernacle is now with man and that'll be me and you will be the inhabitation of god not a building but thank god he's made us a future home though that's going to be perfect to what we wanted when we started our journey you probably didn't even think about a city or a future home you just trying to struggle to get through life you were trying to struggle to serve god but god was sitting there making that city for you the whole time and then thank god he sent us a prophet that could navigate us through this whole thing take away all the fear of well we don't know what's going to happen here we don't know what's going to happen here no the bible told us already it just took a prophetic prophet to bring us that part that we needed to take the fear away from us why would we fear death anymore when we know brother brown said lord don't miss it don't miss it please don't miss it he said that's so glorious he said he said don't worry about it he said that's where you're going you're not going to sleep in a grave you're not going to be in a dark place you're going in a sixth dimension where god is the spirit of god is and all the other people in your group's going to be right there together so he took all the fear away and then he navigated us through the resurrection through the through the uh change of the body through the ascension and took us right on into the millennium saying well the millenniums not we ain't got it don't worry you ain't got to build a house that's for the jews your house is coming and it's going to be built by the divine hand of god not by man's hand and this down here is going to be destroyed in the millennium but up there is not going to be destroyed in that future home so thank god i thank god listen we have a lot of trials and troubles and tribulations but if you'll believe this message of the hour and get in it and dig and dig and dig it will have to take some of the fear away from you it was not sent here for to make you fearful and to make you fear things it was sent to let to let set you free so that you can not have fear of where i'm going or where i'm going to live or what we're going to have or what this is going to be it's all been taken care of so god bless you let's sit go ahead and sit down and we'll cover this real quick i want to thank all of you for coming and being here thank all of you for your participation um we're going to have the youth service on saturday it's starting at three o'clock as far as we that's what we did last time right and then we'll have a regular church service with
