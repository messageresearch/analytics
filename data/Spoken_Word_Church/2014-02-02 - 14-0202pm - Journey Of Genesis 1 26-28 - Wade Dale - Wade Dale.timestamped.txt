[10:11] testimony at while we were while we were
[10:14] out and June can probably help me with
[10:16] this a little bit but uh we were um we
[10:19] were at brother claud's and we were
[10:21] going to be at watch not service on the
[10:24] 31st so my wife and sister Jinger they
[10:27] go to Walmart shop
[10:29] and
[10:31] she drops some of our bills and they go
[10:36] flying in the wind or whatever one bill
[10:39] okay one bill and they they go flying
[10:41] into anyway that she loses the the water
[10:44] Bell or she doesn't know what bill it is
[10:46] at the time I don't think but you did
[10:48] okay knew it was a water bill cuz she
[10:50] knew she was in trouble if she didn't
[10:52] find that
[10:54] bill
[10:55] right turn the camera over there she and
[10:58] you
[10:59] she knew she knew she was going to be in
[11:02] trouble if if we didn't find the water
[11:04] Bell cuz uh one of them had got stuck
[11:07] somewhere last month and it was a little
[11:08] late and you know how I am about late
[11:10] bills we don't have them so um right so
[11:16] anyway so anyway we she do she doesn't
[11:19] tell me about it so remember sisters
[11:21] your sins will find you out some way or
[11:23] the
[11:23] other but um no and he did take care of
[11:26] that because here we go and we we go to
[11:29] watch Night Service and and we're
[11:32] sitting in the back at at brother
[11:33] claude's Church in the fellowship hall
[11:35] and we're we're having lunch before we
[11:36] get started and this sister walks up
[11:39] that I'd never met but one time before
[11:41] uh didn't know exactly who she was so
[11:43] they told me who she was and she hands
[11:46] you in an
[11:52] envelope that's not the strange part of
[11:55] it she lost it in
[11:57] Bartlesville
[11:59] it wound up in cany or in or in or in
[12:04] Dewey Kansas Dewey Oklahoma 15 miles
[12:08] away and it ended up on This Woman's
[12:17] windshield ain't that something ended up
[12:20] on This Woman's windshield that was
[12:22] coming to church that night that didn't
[12:24] know us from anybody I mean it had way
[12:26] and June Dale it had up here on the top
[12:28] and it had the city of or Banks County
[12:30] water department or whatever it was and
[12:32] somebody had found it and somehow it got
[12:34] stuck on her windshield she walked out
[12:37] of the shop and come in and I mean
[12:41] what what would that I mean give me the
[12:44] odds of
[12:45] that give me the odds of somebody
[12:47] finding it and then it wind up 15 miles
[12:50] away in another parking
[12:52] lot attached to a sister's car that
[12:55] obviously nobody in that town knew she
[12:57] was going to church that night to meet
[12:59] us she just hands the envelope to me and
[13:01] says here I believe this is yours or
[13:03] hands it to one of us we were sitting
[13:04] there and said I believe this to me yeah
[13:06] she hand it to me and I said what is
[13:08] this cuz I didn't know we'd lost
[13:12] anything at that time I didn't know I'm
[13:14] sure she would have told me years later
[13:19] but but just see how God works I mean
[13:21] amen you your name amen but remember you
[13:25] see how God takes care of the little
[13:26] things amen I mean that's totally it's
[13:29] not significant at all
[13:31] really but it
[13:34] is yes he does if I can interr the
[13:36] sister that found it had been coming to
[13:39] church with her daughter and she just
[13:41] did not know where she was supposed to
[13:44] be in church and that's I said sister
[13:47] Nancy how did this happen she said I
[13:50] don't know sister but I've been
[13:51] wondering if this is where I'm supposed
[13:52] to be and I said the Lord has told you
[13:55] that you are and I mentioned it to
[13:58] Sister G and Gail said I believe the one
[14:00] that created the wind cuz I mean it was
[14:03] windy as I mean amazing she said the one
[14:07] that created the wind picked that up and
[14:08] put it on sister windsh that's the
[14:11] truth 15 miles away on the very sister's
[14:15] car that was coming to church that night
[14:18] go figure I mean you know this God was
[14:20] working on both ends cuz he answered her
[14:22] prayer and he also kept her out of
[14:26] trouble so but we laugh about it but you
[14:29] know those little things that it all
[14:31] comes together and that's what we're
[14:33] going to talk about tonight let's stand
[14:35] this afternoon is the uh and actually uh
[14:38] you know I told you a long time ago dad
[14:41] and I we don't discuss what we're going
[14:42] to preach so you're going to you're
[14:44] going to hear the same sermon over
[14:46] again um actually Isaiah 53 and all the
[14:50] scriptures we're going to read them
[14:51] again but if you would turn to Genesis
[14:53] 1:26 and we'll start there but what a
[14:56] wonderful testimony I mean God just
[14:57] really uh moved in that sister's life
[15:00] whether we found it or not that wouldn't
[15:01] matter it was a check and we could have
[15:03] rewrote a check and resent it I mean
[15:05] that was no big deal there was no cash
[15:07] in the in the envelope but just to be on
[15:09] that sister I mean Claud and I sat there
[15:11] and we tried to do it with a calculator
[15:13] and it's into the hundreds of thousands
[15:15] of of close to over a million um odds of
[15:19] that ending up 15 miles away on a
[15:23] sister's car that was coming to church
[15:24] that very night and was questioning
[15:27] whether she should come to that church
[15:28] or not
[15:29] so uh we thank God for that and she
[15:32] actually didn't know who she knew me by
[15:34] name and she knew us by name but she
[15:35] didn't know really who we were cuz she
[15:38] had just been coming a few times and uh
[15:40] she was connected in the church by
[15:42] marriage a long time ago but that's all
[15:44] said and done but U you love the Lord
[15:47] amen we did have a good time and we you
[15:49] know we we take this gospel we take this
[15:52] gospel when we go we don't take a
[15:53] different gospel we take the gospel of
[15:56] of Jesus Christ that uh that comes for
[15:58] for from here because we are what we eat
[16:01] right we are what we eat whether you
[16:03] like it or not you are what you eat so
[16:05] we're going to speak today on the
[16:07] Journey of Genesis 1:
[16:09] 26-28 now what we've been doing is we've
[16:11] been giving you the characteristics of
[16:12] Genesis 1 we've been giving you the uh
[16:15] uh what it is and what it's uh what the
[16:18] Tendencies and likeness and and what the
[16:20] we've been talking about DNA we've been
[16:22] talking about gene expression and we've
[16:23] been talking about this man and I think
[16:25] we've come to the conclusion that that
[16:28] it's a very special uh part of God that
[16:30] was created here in Genesis and um as
[16:33] we've been speaking about before it's we
[16:35] got to bring it down though because if
[16:37] it if it happened in Genesis just like
[16:39] the Tree of Life when brother Brown said
[16:40] we were hanging on the tree of life
[16:42] that's down here that's right here where
[16:44] we are today so that's kind of what uhu
[16:47] what we're going to be speaking on so
[16:48] let's bow our heads before we get
[16:49] started Heavenly Father we pray Lord
[16:51] that you would come Among Us father in a
[16:55] special
[16:56] way that you'd bless each one that here
[16:59] that you sanctify us for our journey
[17:01] Lord that you would be the speaker Lord
[17:03] and also be the hearer and be the one
[17:06] that does the does the seeing and all
[17:08] Lord that we may understand you a little
[17:11] a little better Lord we pray that you
[17:13] would just bless the ones that are not
[17:14] here the ones that are sick Lord take
[17:16] care of them and be with them Father be
[17:17] with the little bride around the world
[17:19] be with the missionaries on the Foreign
[17:21] Fields Lord just give them fruit for
[17:22] their labor father we ask that you'd
[17:24] forgive us of our sins and many mistakes
[17:26] that we make toward you father just
[17:28] bless this day take care of us lead us
[17:30] and guide us by your Holy Spirit in
[17:31] Jesus name amen Genesis 1:26 and God
[17:35] said let us make man in our image after
[17:38] our likeness now we all know these
[17:40] Expressions so I'm just going to
[17:41] continue to read this and let them have
[17:43] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[17:44] over the foul of the air and over the
[17:46] cattle and over all the Earth and over
[17:48] every creeping thing that creepeth upon
[17:50] the Earth so God created man in his own
[17:52] image in the image of
[17:54] God in the image of God created he him
[17:58] him male and female created he them and
[18:02] God blessed them so this group of people
[18:04] we say is blessed God blessed them and
[18:07] God said unto them be fruitful and
[18:09] multiply and replenish the Earth so
[18:11] listen what I'm trying to say is they're
[18:12] not stuck in the Garden of Eden right
[18:15] they're not stuck back there trying to
[18:16] develop their s they're that that that
[18:19] group of people is supposed to multiply
[18:21] replenish subdue um Dominion so it's not
[18:25] just that they're going to be stuck in
[18:26] the garden of meeting that's all they
[18:27] got to do now there's a there's a
[18:29] there's a journey of this of this
[18:31] Genesis 1 man that's got to come down
[18:34] through time and it's got to be in
[18:35] continuity with the word of God and
[18:38] subdue it and have dominion over the
[18:39] fish of the sea and over the foul of the
[18:40] air and over every living thing that
[18:42] moveth upon the Earth so now let's go to
[18:44] Isaiah
[18:46] 53 where brother Dale was this
[18:49] morning then we're going to read the
[18:53] same scripture he read Wednesday I mean
[18:55] last Sunday Isaiah 53:9 we're going to
[18:58] start with verse n and he made his grave
[19:01] with the wicked and with the rich in his
[19:02] death because he had done no violence
[19:04] neither was any deceit in his mouth yet
[19:06] it pleased the Lord to bruise him he
[19:09] hath put him to grief when thou shalt
[19:11] make his soul I want to right I want to
[19:14] show you there that Soul when he shall
[19:17] make his soul an offering for sin now
[19:20] remember his body was beaten and bruised
[19:22] and his by his stripes were healed and
[19:24] all those things that that was the body
[19:26] Behold the Lamb of God that takes away
[19:28] the sin of the world that was the son of
[19:30] man that was the god in human flesh but
[19:33] this right here that his soul the soul
[19:34] of Jesus Christ
[19:37] right almighty God when thou shalt make
[19:40] his soul an offering for sin he shall
[19:43] see a seed cuz that's where his seed
[19:45] reside not in his Natural Body he shall
[19:48] prolong his days and the plagge of the
[19:49] Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall
[19:52] see of the travail of his
[19:53] soul okay talkinging about his soul and
[19:56] shall be satisfied by his knowledge
[19:59] shall my righteous servant justify many
[20:01] for he shall bear their iniquities
[20:03] therefore will I divide him a portion
[20:05] with the great and he shall divide the
[20:07] spoil with the strong because he has
[20:10] poor he's he's sharing
[20:13] right you will get to that in a minute
[20:15] he's sharing he's not keeping it for
[20:17] himself he's sharing amen remember God
[20:19] is Elohim he is self-existing he doesn't
[20:21] need us to exist he doesn't need air to
[20:24] breathe he doesn't need an earth to
[20:26] stand on but he decided that he wanted
[20:28] that he had attributes to that really
[20:31] compelled him to do it it was his desire
[20:34] God has
[20:35] desires right all right remember he
[20:37] desired it all be saved but it but it's
[20:40] up to me and you whether we are or not
[20:42] therefore will I divide him a portion
[20:44] with the great and he shall divide the
[20:45] spoil with the strong because he ha
[20:47] poured out his soul unto death now the
[20:50] soul my soul this soul of this
[20:52] individual can't die right but he poured
[20:54] out his soul unto death right all right
[20:57] played the part of death death the
[20:58] prophet said and he was numbered with
[21:00] the transgressors and he bear the sin of
[21:01] many and made intercession for the
[21:04] transgressor now let's go to John
[21:15] 1:1 let's um let's read between the
[21:19] lines you want to do that just not going
[21:22] to change the word in the beginning was
[21:25] Genesis 1:26 and 27 right and Genesis 1
[21:29] 126 and 27 was with God right and
[21:32] Genesis 126 and 27 was God
[21:35] Amen that's too close brother now I
[21:37] don't think we got far close enough yet
[21:39] the same was in the beginning with God
[21:42] all things were made by him remember
[21:44] that was the logos the
[21:57] theophonic he came into his own and his
[21:59] own received him
[22:00] not but as many as that Genesis 126 and
[22:03] 27 received him to them gave he
[22:07] power to become the sons of God Amen
[22:11] even to them that believe on his name
[22:13] which were born not of
[22:15] blood remember that Genesis 126 man is
[22:18] not born of blood there's no blood in
[22:19] that Genesis 126 man nor of the will of
[22:22] the flesh nor of the will of man but of
[22:25] God and Genesis 126 was made
[22:28] fles
[22:31] exactly amen nobody's left
[22:34] yet and Genesis 126 was made flesh and
[22:37] dwelt among us and we beheld his glory
[22:40] the glory of the only begotten of the
[22:41] father full of grace and truth you may
[22:43] be seated and the Lord add his Blessing
[22:45] to the reading of his word that's why I
[22:47] want to bring this thing down just a
[22:48] little bit
[22:49] closer we know that that in studying
[22:52] Genesis 1:26 and and like I say again
[22:55] thank you the Sunday school class I'm
[22:56] using my
[22:58] my uh iPad I've been using it out and I
[23:02] really enjoy it I've been getting
[23:03] getting to used to getting used to using
[23:06] it thank you for it it really helps cuz
[23:09] you can
[23:11] really put your thoughts down and then
[23:13] you thoughts can be expressed on on the
[23:16] uh oh brother Joe's got a chart back
[23:19] there and uh it breaks down what you can
[23:22] hear is so much a percent retention and
[23:25] what you can see is so much retention
[23:27] what you can see and here and what's put
[23:29] up on the screen there's so much more
[23:30] retention so it's not just that you read
[23:33] something or you hear something you
[23:34] retain it a lot better if you see it so
[23:37] we're going to look at this
[23:39] today and pull up the first quote if you
[23:41] want
[23:42] to in 1957 questions and answers on
[23:46] Hebrews in
[23:48] Jeffersonville that brother brandham
[23:50] said that's Genesis 1 where he created
[23:52] man in his own image which was in the
[23:54] theophany so are we okay to say that
[23:56] Genesis 126 is
[23:59] theophany that's what he said right here
[24:02] all right so you argue with him and in
[24:04] Genesis 2 he made Man Out of the Dust of
[24:06] the earth now that's animal flesh that's
[24:08] the what you're looking at now which was
[24:10] the human man that we have now and then
[24:12] in three was to fall and was kicked from
[24:15] the Garden of Eden now whatever that was
[24:19] and I'm giving you the I'm asking you
[24:21] the question whatever that was then as
[24:24] the fall developed and we'll we'll look
[24:26] at it in number two but don't pull it up
[24:28] right yet there was something Lost In
[24:30] the Garden of
[24:33] Eden the ability to produce this Genesis
[24:36] 1 was lost in the Garden of Eden we went
[24:38] through that before all right but we see
[24:41] those words up at the top I want you to
[24:43] kind of keep looking at them because all
[24:45] the quotes from the previous sermons
[24:47] we've had brother bam said that that was
[24:49] theophany logos a spirit being uh the
[24:52] Holy Ghost Christ uh it definitely is a
[24:55] supernatural being whatever it is a
[24:57] supernatural
[24:58] Genesis 126 and 27 man whatever you want
[25:01] to whatever you want to deal with it was
[25:03] a supernatural being it wasn't a natural
[25:06] man and it wasn't all
[25:10] mankind that's right it wasn't all
[25:13] mankind because here you see as we go
[25:16] over it again in Genesis 1 the word God
[25:18] was used 30 times and that means Elohim
[25:21] self-existing does not need anything to
[25:24] exist
[25:26] and he's God
[25:29] all right now in Genesis 2 you see the
[25:32] word Lord God come into being which is
[25:36] Jehovah with a family so you see him
[25:38] putting the 126 man and the 27 man but
[25:41] as he made this Genesis 126 man and it
[25:44] it was in plurality which he says them
[25:47] them is plural all right I want you to
[25:49] keep that word them and they because
[25:51] later on in the sermon we're going to
[25:52] bring it back out because Jesus
[25:55] absolutely absolutely identified that
[25:57] Genesis 1:26 in a prayer that he
[26:00] prayed and we'll get to it in just a
[26:02] little while all right because you look
[26:04] at the days and the thems because really
[26:07] uh I guess he didn't want Moses to spend
[26:10] time because see if Moses would have had
[26:11] time he could have wrote all the names
[26:16] down but he didn't it's just it's a
[26:20] group of people it's them it's they
[26:22] right it's a group that comes under this
[26:25] this uh spirit being Holy Ghost
[26:28] the Christ the Creator I I want us to
[26:31] see that that God is is
[26:35] not he's not EMP he's not totally
[26:37] emptying himself out but he is giving
[26:40] part of what he is to somebody else
[26:42] right okay he's giving part of what he
[26:44] is to somebody else that's what it is in
[26:46] Genesis 1: 126 so it's a supernatural
[26:49] being brother Bram called a theophany
[26:52] now we look at that word and we keep
[26:54] that word theophany now let's go to to
[26:57] number two two but remember one thing
[26:59] for sure whatever this Genesis 126 man
[27:03] it is the characteristics of God right
[27:06] it's the characteristics of the almighty
[27:09] it's it's his DNA or his gene expression
[27:12] like Daddy was saying this morning Adam
[27:14] and Eve if you were to do a DNA test
[27:17] they come from the same
[27:19] Source now there's a key to
[27:23] that because June and I have been
[27:26] married for 34 years
[27:28] we're
[27:30] one but we're not one like that
[27:33] one I'll read you a quote in a minute
[27:35] where brother BR separated and brought
[27:36] it out but but listen Adam I mean Eve
[27:40] came out of Adam the very DNA a very
[27:43] piece of Adam came out and was made Eve
[27:46] so he was not lying when he said she's
[27:48] bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh
[27:51] she was literally that
[27:53] amen so guess what in the Garden of Eden
[27:56] it was only supposed to to be one
[27:59] DNA Adam and Eve that was it one gene
[28:03] expression and that was supposed to come
[28:04] from Adam and Eve but we know what
[28:07] happened in the garden
[28:08] that her womb was polluted so God
[28:11] couldn't bring us right but we see that
[28:14] there was something else that was lost
[28:16] and we see here in Revelation CH 5 1961
[28:20] says now our Kinsman is handed now we're
[28:21] going to read this one again but I cut a
[28:23] little bit off of it to save time sister
[28:26] Trudy told me to slow down so let me
[28:27] slow down a
[28:29] minute Revelations
[28:32] 5 now our Kinsman has handed the seven
[28:35] sealed book of redemption from the
[28:37] original owner the original owner look
[28:40] what he said when we lost it
[28:45] right when we lost it so we're
[28:48] represented with Adam and Eve when we
[28:50] lost it at the Garden of Eden through
[28:54] Adam it went back to the original owner
[28:57] but but there's been a poacher on the
[28:58] land a squatter that's Satan he came
[29:01] over he's a poacher this Earth don't
[29:03] belong to him belongs to God but he's a
[29:05] poacher a squatter man how I could say
[29:08] something right now but I better not
[29:10] it's a title deed of our Redemption this
[29:12] seven seal book it's the title deed you
[29:15] wait till we get to those seals now
[29:18] let's go to number three souls in prison
[29:20] now 1963 now notice when this Redeemer
[29:24] John looked around and here sat God on
[29:26] the throne with a book in his hand now
[29:29] that was the same book that Adam
[29:34] had could you say Amen somebody may be
[29:37] watching man I want to make sure there's
[29:38] some people
[29:45] here here sat God on a throne with a
[29:47] book in his hand that had been sealed
[29:49] with Seven Seals and the whole Plan of
[29:51] Redemption was in it right it had been
[29:55] lost by the human race Adam
[29:57] and God it went back where Satan
[29:59] couldn't take it he just caused him to
[30:02] lose
[30:03] it but where did the book go to then
[30:06] right didn't belong to the human race
[30:09] amen the blessings didn't belong here
[30:13] here the human race had lost it so it
[30:15] went back went right on back to its
[30:17] original owner that was
[30:20] God so it went back and Adam was not
[30:22] able to produce this Genesis 126 I you
[30:25] ought to see right there if the womb was
[30:27] polluted if the if the natural womb and
[30:30] the spiritual womb of Eve was polluted
[30:32] then there's no way for this Genesis 126
[30:35] person to develop
[30:38] right God's got it now that's why God
[30:42] said in other words like I was saying it
[30:44] it was an it was a conditional Covenant
[30:47] then it became an unconditional Covenant
[30:48] amen cuz God said you can't do it Adam
[30:51] I'm going to do it now I'm the only one
[30:53] that can hold the book and keep it
[30:56] straight amen I'm the only one that can
[30:58] bring my children the way I'm supposed
[31:00] the way they're supposed to be brought
[31:02] all right and remember we talked about
[31:04] the weight of the tree if you look at
[31:05] some of these key points here the way to
[31:07] the tree it wasn't that the tree was
[31:09] lost it was just the way to get to the
[31:11] tree was lost all right but now remember
[31:14] like I said God is not going to God
[31:16] could have been real
[31:18] selfish and say well I'm just going to
[31:20] stop right here and I'm not going to do
[31:23] this anymore I I've Adam and Eve's done
[31:25] messed this thing up and they were the
[31:27] two greatest things I had and and they
[31:29] were the greatest things on earth and
[31:31] they were supposed to produce this and I
[31:32] told them to do this and I told him not
[31:34] to do that I'll just I'll just not do
[31:37] anything no that's not what he
[31:40] did right cuz he's had a desire in his
[31:43] heart to get that out he had a desire
[31:46] for that Genesis 126 man to develop cuz
[31:49] that was his children he was a father
[31:51] what a great father he wanted to get his
[31:53] kids out so he could talk to them he
[31:55] wanted to get his kids out so he could
[31:56] so so he could actually like brother
[31:58] Brown said play with them like a child
[32:01] playing before the before the father's
[32:02] door you see that all those things that
[32:04] brother Brown was telling us it's a way
[32:06] of expression but it's
[32:08] exactly the ability to produce what he
[32:11] said Adam couldn't produce what God
[32:14] Said Eve definitely couldn't produce
[32:16] what God Said but God can produce what
[32:19] God
[32:20] Said but that put us all then on equal
[32:23] basis it all put us on free moral agency
[32:25] where all of us have a choice Adam had a
[32:27] choice Eve had a choice all the way down
[32:29] through we have a
[32:30] choice thank you Lord but now
[32:33] look we're going to start here and look
[32:35] at
[32:36] something brother brandham said if you
[32:38] can't see Christ in every
[32:40] verse amen go back and read it
[32:43] again all right now if we see Christ see
[32:46] I see Christ in Genesis 1:26 because
[32:48] that's what we that's what that
[32:49] developed
[32:52] into okay Paul said it's Christ in you
[32:55] the hope of glory so Christ the lamb the
[32:57] Holy Ghost brother Brown said the same
[32:59] it's titles to the same person so it's
[33:02] the Holy Ghost you said no it's Christ
[33:04] well Christ and the Holy Ghost is the
[33:06] same person
[33:08] amen so anyway but we were given a law
[33:12] you see that L we were given a law to go
[33:15] by which it wasn't really A law but it
[33:17] was God in letter form but man took it
[33:19] as a law because of our carnal mind the
[33:22] problem with it is that we became
[33:25] carnal we became carnal
[33:27] Man became carnal they man wasn't
[33:29] spiritual much in the New Testament I
[33:31] mean the Old Testament we were talking
[33:32] this morning if you'll look at this it
[33:35] really help you because we're
[33:37] on patience on Statue of a perfect man
[33:41] we're up to
[33:42] patience patience is not mentioned in
[33:44] the Old Testament not one time that's
[33:46] right
[33:48] amen it's mentioned 33 times in the New
[33:51] Testament but it's not mentioned one
[33:53] time in the Old Testament a lot of them
[33:55] didn't have patience like sister Trudy
[33:57] said a lot of things was ugly that
[33:59] happened in the Old Testament that you
[34:00] can't type Christ but you see Christ
[34:02] working right you see him anointing you
[34:05] see we're going to read in just a little
[34:06] while that that even brother R said we
[34:08] were with
[34:11] Noah amen we were with Noah because of
[34:14] Noah Noah's anointing we were with
[34:18] Noah Hebrews
[34:20] 10:1 same one D was quoting this morning
[34:23] but watch how that develops out of that
[34:25] Old Testament because watch for the law
[34:28] having a shadow of good things to come
[34:30] and not the very image of the
[34:33] things image right amen see these words
[34:37] for the law having a shadow of good
[34:39] things to come and not the very image of
[34:42] things now we were made in the image of
[34:43] God amen amen and we were going to be
[34:46] developed but we couldn't be developed
[34:48] in the Old Testament cuz God had the
[34:50] book and there was no way like I read
[34:53] you the quote last time and and brother
[34:55] Dale read it too that God had to come in
[34:58] human flesh before that Eternal Tree of
[35:00] Life remember the quote before that
[35:02] Eternal Tree of Life could do us any
[35:04] good it had to be human flesh first
[35:06] because we fell in human
[35:08] flesh and there was nobody worthy in the
[35:10] Old Testament no one no one was called a
[35:13] Son of God in the Old Testament except
[35:14] Adam right okay right a Abraham was
[35:20] called a friend of God not a child of
[35:22] God right amen
[35:25] amen that's a great revelation there
[35:27] because we were there yes but there's no
[35:31] way that could get into a body right it
[35:34] could anoint the Christ could anoint in
[35:37] the Old Testament and and such a great
[35:39] anointing till Moses face shine
[35:42] amen but then when that came away it was
[35:46] just
[35:48] Moses there wasn't enough to hold him
[35:50] that's right cuz he would have I mean
[35:52] killed an Egyptian he was a murderer for
[35:55] then would they not have ceased to be oh
[35:57] I'm sorry but not the very image of
[35:58] things can never with these sacrifices
[36:00] which they offered year by year
[36:02] continually make the C there un
[36:04] perfect that's the Old Testament up
[36:07] until John the Baptist those sacrifices
[36:09] were made because there was no new birth
[36:12] there that's right
[36:14] amen if not the C would be made perfect
[36:16] one time he made a sacrifice it'd be
[36:18] perfect that's right cuz you and I once
[36:21] the sacrifice is made we're perfect
[36:23] right because we have the new birth
[36:25] inside of us
[36:27] not as just a anointing and a lifting
[36:30] off an anointing sure there's different
[36:32] anointings but it's the one that John
[36:35] the Baptist the holy spirit said the one
[36:38] you see the Holy Spirit come on and
[36:42] remain
[36:44] amen cuz I'm sure he probably saw kyus
[36:47] and all these different ones the Holy
[36:49] Spirit would anoint him and John being a
[36:50] prophet he could see that remember how
[36:52] that brother brandham we were talking
[36:53] about last night brother Bram saw the
[36:55] two brothers in the church in the
[36:56] Pentecostal Church one was one was
[36:58] prophesying the other one would speak in
[37:00] tongues and one would interpret the one
[37:02] speaking in tongues he shook his hand he
[37:03] said he's a he's a real solid Christian
[37:05] but this brother over here was living
[37:07] with another woman and had two children
[37:09] by her he was wondering well it was in
[37:12] brother Brown saw the anointing on the
[37:13] man that's why he couldn't understand
[37:15] same way with John the Baptist so the
[37:17] Holy Ghost had to tell him say the one
[37:19] you see go on and remain amen that's the
[37:23] one that's going to be the savior of the
[37:25] world Amen these little things help you
[37:28] maybe a little bit for then would they
[37:30] have ceased it was offered year by
[37:33] year it was offered every year why
[37:35] couldn't make you
[37:37] perfect pretty simple for then would
[37:40] they not have ceased to be offered right
[37:42] because that the worshipper once purged
[37:44] should have had no more conscience of
[37:46] sins that's what I want to we were
[37:48] talking about last night and you know
[37:50] all these people that that believe that
[37:52] you were you come here with eternal life
[37:53] and you had this eternal seed in you
[37:55] come on people we don't believe believe
[37:56] that right right not that way we believe
[37:59] what brother BR said but I you know they
[38:01] always used a woman at the
[38:03] well this seed come alive
[38:06] right well now why didn't it come alive
[38:08] in Peter James and John right amen while
[38:11] Jesus was here that's right you ever
[38:13] thought about that brother Bram said he
[38:16] come alive I know it did it quickened
[38:17] what she held but Peter James and John
[38:20] all those disciples they were with the
[38:22] word every day why didn't that seed
[38:24] Quicken right oness with brother BR said
[38:27] God wasn't in them yet that's why right
[38:30] but once God they went to the upper room
[38:31] and got the Holy Ghost God was in them
[38:33] then amen that's right that's what we
[38:37] believe it's just it's just it's like
[38:39] teren said it's you know it just does
[38:42] way with salvation if you say you come
[38:43] here with eternal life does way with the
[38:46] whole Plan of Salvation there is's no
[38:48] Plan of Salvation cuz we don't need
[38:50] it no we were lost right the seed was
[38:54] with God Amen the seed was that Genesis
[38:57] 126 and 27 I hope you can see that
[38:59] that's why I said those people that
[39:00] preach that they don't understand SE the
[39:02] seed of God they don't understand
[39:04] Genesis 126 they don't understand a soul
[39:06] they don't understand what a theophany
[39:07] is right sorry they just don't they've
[39:10] not been taught well enough right sorry
[39:13] amen but in these sacrifices there was
[39:16] REM remembrance again made of sin every
[39:21] year for it is not possible that the
[39:23] blood of bulls and goats should take
[39:25] away sin right
[39:26] so during the Old Testament there was
[39:28] nothing there there was no there was no
[39:31] indwelling of God that could make them
[39:34] perfect amen that's
[39:36] right for it's not possible that the
[39:38] blood bulls and goats should take away
[39:39] sin wherefore when he cometh into the
[39:41] world he sayith sacrifice and offerings
[39:43] thou wouldest not but a body hast thou
[39:45] pre prepared me we know the prophets
[39:47] that's what they did they prepared the
[39:49] body of Jesus so that Jesus could walk
[39:51] out on the what on the
[39:52] word he was the word right amen
[39:58] John
[40:00] 1:14 the word was made flesh and dwelt
[40:03] Among
[40:04] Us and he had us in him right we didn't
[40:08] come here with him and
[40:10] US amen for unto you is Born This Day
[40:14] Luke 2:11 listen to this catch this for
[40:18] unto you is Born This Day in the city of
[40:20] David a savior which is Christ the
[40:25] lord so Now where's Genesis
[40:27] 126 if Genesis 126 is the
[40:33] Christ where is it where is it it's sent
[40:37] a
[40:38] baby called
[40:40] Jesus but he had to come in human flesh
[40:44] cuz we were lost in human flesh we
[40:46] that's simple we all know that that's
[40:48] right but there's gen there's the
[40:50] Genesis 3:15
[40:53] seed right Christ
[40:57] the
[40:59] book remember I read the quote the other
[41:02] day to a to a group of people and and
[41:05] they kind of look at you with you know
[41:06] when when your eyebrows kind of go up
[41:08] like that they you know the computer's
[41:10] turning or something's going on you know
[41:13] because brother randam said in adoption
[41:14] series he said Jesus didn't come to
[41:16] bring you your inheritance
[41:21] right he didn't come to bring you your
[41:23] inheritance your inheritance was that
[41:24] Genesis 126 before the foundation of the
[41:27] world he came to bring a way to get you
[41:29] back to that inheritance amen he said I
[41:32] am the way the truth and the life I'm
[41:34] the way to get
[41:36] back so there's the way to get back to
[41:38] the
[41:39] book cuz he couldn't trust it with
[41:42] anybody else he couldn't trust it with
[41:43] Moses he couldn't trust it with Elijah
[41:45] he couldn't trust it with name your name
[41:48] in the Old Testament he had to come
[41:50] himself but he came with that ability to
[41:54] produce you and I amen
[41:58] amen if you don't see Christ in every
[42:00] verse I say if you don't see you in
[42:01] every verse
[42:03] right exactly if Christ is in you the
[42:06] hope of glory if you can't see you in
[42:09] every verse
[42:11] right that Luke 211 that to me that
[42:14] identifies where that Genesis 126 man
[42:18] landed
[42:21] hello the theophany of God yes how
[42:25] powerful
[42:26] there was the
[42:28] creator there was the one that said let
[42:30] there
[42:31] be but there was the one that said
[42:33] father forgive
[42:34] them for they don't know what they're
[42:36] doing right
[42:39] amen but now we were in a book when we
[42:41] were born that's right remember we were
[42:44] put in a natural book brother Brown said
[42:46] your name was written in the book at
[42:48] your natural birth but then your name
[42:50] was transferred now we know there's not
[42:51] an angel sitting up there transferring
[42:53] names he's just showing us how that we
[42:55] were hung on the tree of knowledge of
[42:57] Good and Evil like we said before right
[42:59] we all came here on the tree of
[43:01] knowledge of Good and Evil
[43:02] amen we didn't come here in the tree of
[43:05] life that's why we didn't have eternal
[43:06] life when we got here brother Bram said
[43:08] after you're born again you're hanging
[43:11] on the Tree of Life remember the quote
[43:13] after you're born again you're hanging
[43:14] on the tree of life so your name's got
[43:16] to be transferred that's what he's
[43:18] talking about right amen from your
[43:20] natural life if you stay that way then
[43:22] you're going to have to be judged by
[43:24] that natural life right the tree of
[43:26] knowledge is works right ain't that what
[43:29] Cain did amen works works works works
[43:32] works right but the tree of life is it's
[43:35] not what you do it's what he done Glory
[43:37] chosen in him before the foundation of
[43:39] the world not chosen by him right chosen
[43:43] in him there's a difference those little
[43:44] words make a
[43:45] difference but remember in Isaiah he
[43:48] said he would see his seed Not seeds
[43:52] exactly one seed Galatians 3:16 there's
[43:56] one seed which is Christ but it's in a
[43:58] multiple
[44:01] form but there's the theophany of God
[44:05] Amen but now remember let's go to
[44:09] Christ's revealing his own word let's
[44:10] back up just a
[44:12] minute we know where Christ
[44:15] was but now
[44:18] remember Christ showed up in the Old
[44:22] Testament not Jesus Christ but Christ
[44:25] showed up in the Old
[44:27] Testament right so now if now we're
[44:31] going to read this and I want you to
[44:32] keep that word theophany in your mind
[44:34] right and what I said that theophany was
[44:37] Genesis 1:26 man right and didn't we
[44:40] prove that brother Brown already said
[44:41] that okay all right I'm trying to bring
[44:43] this together to show you that that let
[44:46] me just give you the
[44:48] punchline if Christ is in you the hope
[44:50] of
[44:51] glory you were there from the foundation
[44:54] of the world the eternal life that's in
[44:56] you always was eternal
[44:59] amen but the reason and I've said this
[45:01] many times before but the reason we can
[45:03] understand the Bible the reason that
[45:04] that book is now
[45:06] open is because we're that book
[45:09] amen we're not reading it as a
[45:12] secondhand
[45:14] information we are the book that was
[45:16] written on and it was written in the Old
[45:20] Testament too right amen that's why I
[45:23] can
[45:24] see what Moses did did Glory just like
[45:27] Moses saw what Adam did right
[45:31] amen
[45:33] amen Moses wasn't there when Adam and
[45:35] Eve did what they did right God just
[45:37] pulled him up a big television one day
[45:39] and said here write this down right so
[45:41] he wrote it down what happened in the
[45:43] garden well that's what God's given us a
[45:45] vision not a television but a vision
[45:48] Amen brother BR said television was in
[45:50] the Garden of Eden right okay all right
[45:53] he was alive in the Old Testament
[45:54] manifested I just want to let you see a
[45:57] little something here if you can stand
[45:58] it watch when Jesus was manifested in
[46:01] the Old Testament as we believe it now
[46:03] you preachers out there you can argue
[46:05] with it do whatever you want to but I'm
[46:06] talking for my what I think see when
[46:09] Jesus was manifested in the Old
[46:11] Testament in a theophany
[46:14] right in the person of MDC
[46:19] right not a priesthood amen but a
[46:23] person the man Capital
[46:29] him for this man had yet not been
[46:34] born but he was in a theophany so he had
[46:37] no father no mother he was God himself
[46:40] he was manifested in the form of a man
[46:42] called King of Salem which is king of
[46:43] peace and king of righteousness see he
[46:45] was mzc he had neither father nor mother
[46:47] beginning of days or ending of Life see
[46:49] it was Jesus in the theophany in the
[46:52] form of a man could you get it all right
[46:57] right but that man mezc couldn't die for
[47:02] you he couldn't be your savior he
[47:05] couldn't even be your brother come
[47:08] on okay but there's that theophany there
[47:12] and then Moses Moses said God I want to
[47:14] see you it was a back part of a man who
[47:18] was it Jesus Christ but who was it me
[47:21] and you right amen we were in him right
[47:25] amen
[47:26] oh I wish we could see
[47:29] that I wish we could really see
[47:34] that number
[47:36] five so we got mzc we got Jesus Christ
[47:39] in the form of mzc but it's not Jesus
[47:41] the flesh now we understand that cuz
[47:43] that man mzc everybody understand that I
[47:45] know you've been taught that 100 times
[47:46] mzc couldn't die for you so he couldn't
[47:48] be your Kinsman right Boaz had to be kin
[47:52] to Naomi right to be able to do the
[47:55] right of Redemption all
[47:58] right and do you know that legally Boaz
[48:01] could claim everything and keep it for
[48:04] himself but he gave it to Naomi just
[48:06] like Christ claimed everything but he
[48:08] wanted to give it to us and I'll read it
[48:10] to you in just a second now look number
[48:14] five let's close our eyes to our
[48:16] imaginations for a few moments and go
[48:18] back into the four there was anything
[48:20] the great Fountain of all eternity was
[48:22] that Spirit of love joy that Spirit of
[48:24] honesty Spirit of tress in this
[48:26] Perfection then out of the existence of
[48:28] the father went to logos which was the
[48:30] son which was the
[48:32] theophany right see there's your Genesis
[48:35] 126 man right there that's right oh
[48:38] Church we've been veiled we've been
[48:40] veiled since the beginning of time
[48:43] amen that's right but
[48:46] today we're able to look back and see
[48:49] that which was that which is and that
[48:50] which is to come cuz the book's open
[48:54] amen right
[48:57] cuz if you're another part if you're a
[48:58] different part of God you're a second
[49:00] person of
[49:01] God you're the devil that's right yes
[49:04] brother Bram said if you see two in the
[49:06] Bible one's God he said the other one's
[49:08] got to be a devil so we better stay in
[49:11] God Amen we better stay in
[49:15] God Amen which was the theophany which
[49:19] was the body of the great Jehovah God
[49:21] went forth in a Celestial body that's
[49:23] the logos the words spoke out of them
[49:26] great fountains in the beginning was the
[49:29] word spoke out of them great Fountains
[49:31] of life and went forth and there was the
[49:33] theophany which was God made into word
[49:36] right then that theophany was made flesh
[49:39] in the person Christ Jesus and then all
[49:42] the fullness of the Trinity bless
[49:45] brother Brown's
[49:48] heart he knew what he was talking
[49:51] about all the fullness of the trinity
[49:53] dwelt in him both father son andly Holy
[49:55] Ghost all in that and that's the very
[49:58] way we go come on
[50:00] right do we catch these little things
[50:03] and that's the very way we go Plum back
[50:06] to the original beginning of God exactly
[50:09] do you know one thing's for sure the
[50:11] only reason he was a fullness of the
[50:12] godhead B is cuz you were in him amen oh
[50:15] my
[50:16] right how about that exactly the only
[50:20] reason he was a fullness of the godhead
[50:22] bodies he had all that Genesis 126 man
[50:25] in out of him that made him the fullest
[50:28] that made him father that made him son
[50:30] that made him holy ghost that made him
[50:32] his children made manifest in another
[50:34] form I may run in a minute daddy said
[50:37] something about being Pentecostal I may
[50:38] just F about five minutes may be
[50:42] one all his bride was in him that's why
[50:47] catch that that's why he was the
[50:49] fullness of the godhead B that's why
[50:51] brother Dale 50 years ago preached that
[50:53] the Bride of Jesus Christ is the
[50:54] fullness of the god godhead bodily why
[50:57] cuz that was what was made him the
[50:58] fullness of the godhead bod as the bride
[51:01] you see all he's got other
[51:02] manifestations sure he does sure he does
[51:06] but you know what I have other
[51:07] manifestations too but I'm a Daddy to my
[51:09] children right right they're the
[51:13] greatest God thinks the greatest of his
[51:15] children all right so let's just put it
[51:18] that way we know he's all these
[51:19] different things but there's one thing
[51:21] for sure when he came here on Earth he
[51:23] had one purpose in mind right
[51:26] to get his kids out of him just like you
[51:28] and I if we were all knowing if we were
[51:30] omnipotent if we knew everything that
[51:32] was going on do you know we would know
[51:34] how many kids we had it would just
[51:35] excite us to no end to get those kids
[51:37] out cuz there's no way to fellowship
[51:39] with them while they're inside of you
[51:41] you got to get them out so God knew
[51:44] exactly how many kids he was going to
[51:45] have so he knew he was going to have to
[51:47] come and and get them out of him some
[51:48] way so he had to release a life because
[51:51] it was in that capsule that I was
[51:52] telling you about there was a capsule of
[51:54] flesh called Jesus amen amen but his
[51:57] soul is what he gave a ransom Glory I
[52:00] don't have it up here and don't go to it
[52:01] but it is
[52:03] in did I write it down maybe I didn't
[52:07] oops I may have left it back there but
[52:09] somewhere in the Book of Matthew Matthew
[52:12] 2028 Jesus says he gave his
[52:15] soul a ransom or he gave his life it
[52:18] says he gave his life a ransom Life Soul
[52:20] whatever you want to call it that's what
[52:22] he did and then in Isaiah 53 it didn't
[52:24] say his body he said his soul he gave
[52:27] his soul an offering for sin he gave his
[52:30] own being his own self uh because you
[52:33] know why you and I were in it Glory so
[52:36] he comes down and he preaches he has a
[52:38] three and a half year Ministry and he
[52:39] preaches and he shows the word so that
[52:42] you and I can come forth cuz remember
[52:43] we're word born children right that's
[52:46] why you have to hear the word first
[52:48] before you're born again you have to
[52:49] hear the word before it can be quickened
[52:52] amen can't just come here with eternal
[52:54] life and just say well I got it you know
[52:56] that's it that's right you can't do that
[52:59] show me one place in the Bible where
[53:01] somebody just got the Holy Ghost cuz he
[53:02] was who he was except Jesus not one
[53:07] person they all had to hear the word
[53:10] they all had to while the word was being
[53:12] preached well while the word was being
[53:14] preached while you look in the book of
[53:16] Acts look at the Ethiopian unit right
[53:19] why didn't the word just Quicken to him
[53:21] right there while he was on The Chariot
[53:22] right right he didn't have the Holy
[53:24] Ghost amen he didn't have the new birth
[53:27] he didn't have nothing to Quicken
[53:28] with he could read right but
[53:33] philli a man the Bible says full of the
[53:35] Holy Ghost so if he was full he had
[53:37] enough to give out
[53:40] right so he give some to the Ethiopian
[53:42] unic and guess what God quickened the
[53:44] word to him
[53:46] amen just keep his little thoughts in
[53:48] your mind but he swed the word and I
[53:51] wrote a a comment down here back there
[53:53] in the back it's our nourishment the
[53:55] word is our nourishment that's where we
[53:57] come from We're word born children so
[53:59] God put the word here remember he didn't
[54:01] bring us here and then write the Bible
[54:04] right and I'm not talking about just the
[54:06] written written word right right he
[54:08] didn't we didn't get here and and and
[54:11] then this this came
[54:14] later the word came first in the
[54:17] beginning was the word word and the Word
[54:20] was with God and the Word was God that's
[54:22] why I said Genesis
[54:24] 1:26 we're in this word right here right
[54:26] amen this is our gene expression this is
[54:29] where our family members are come from
[54:32] like brother Dale was preaching there on
[54:34] on the Masterpiece family this is the
[54:36] same thing amen this is the Masterpiece
[54:38] family it's just in a little different
[54:40] little different
[54:42] way where were we the ministry of Jesus
[54:44] Christ all right now I want you to look
[54:46] now in
[54:48] John
[54:50] 17 Jesus
[54:54] prays
[54:56] John

[55:00] 9 you can read the whole thing but I'm
[55:02] going to bring this out but I want you
[55:03] to look at all these I I highlighted

[55:12] right who you praying
[55:14] for I pray for
[55:17] them in the beginning was word word with
[55:19] God and Word was
[55:23] God Genesis 1 126 six and God said let
[55:27] us make man our own image after our
[55:28] likeness and let them have dominion over
[55:30] the fish of the sea foul of the air and
[55:32] they have dominion right them and they
[55:35] you see what I'm talking about I pray
[55:37] for them I pray not for the world so
[55:40] he's praying for a specific group of
[55:42] people that's
[55:44] right but for them which thou Hast given
[55:48] me for they are thine amen and all mine
[55:52] are
[55:54] thine and thine are mine
[55:58] right but he didn't keep it in yourself
[56:00] no and I'm glorified in them right

[56:09] time boy when I read this other day I
[56:11] didn't even have it in a sermon and I
[56:12] sitting at home
[56:14] and that's that's when I get my
[56:16] anointing is when I'm at home here I
[56:19] just preached what I got bless where was
[56:22] I John 179 I pray for them I pray not
[56:24] for the world for them which thou has
[56:25] given me for they are thine and all mine

[56:28] glorified in them John
[56:32] 17:20 neither pray I for these alone but
[56:34] for them also that Shall Believe on me
[56:36] through their word in other words the
[56:38] ones that's with him and the ones that's
[56:39] coming all right that they may be one
[56:44] exactly as thou father art in me and I
[56:47] in thee that they also may be one in
[56:52] us that the world may believe that th
[56:55] has sent me and the glory which thou
[56:57] gavest me I have given them right that
[57:01] they may be one amen even as we are one
[57:03] amen i in them thou in me that they may
[57:09] be made perfect in one amen now Jesus
[57:12] was perfect so he was talking about us

[57:18] that thou has sent me and H has loved
[57:20] them
[57:21] right as thou H has loved me amen

[57:29] wall CU that's God's
[57:32] prayer that's Jesus's prayer and that's
[57:35] what protects us amen that's our
[57:37] protection right there that's our all in
[57:40] all that's our that's our Perfection cuz
[57:43] if they're perfect and we're in them we
[57:46] can't be imperfect we got to be perfect
[57:49] amen all
[57:50] right Isaiah 53 let's read that one more
[57:53] time yet it pleased the Lord to bruise
[57:55] him he ha put him to grief when thou
[57:56] shalt make his soul an offering for sin
[57:59] he shall see his seed he shall prolong
[58:01] his days and the Pleasers of the Lord
[58:03] shall prosper in his hand
[58:07] amen couple more and then I want to read
[58:09] you one long
[58:11] one but I think it's very
[58:13] powerful now this number six we're going
[58:16] to read
[58:18] 1957 we're going to see our
[58:19] identification we all know that when
[58:21] when Jesus was here that
[58:25] after this John 17 that he went to
[58:29] Calvary and he died for our sins we know
[58:31] that here he goes where did he leave
[58:33] when he left this is in Tuma the Bible
[58:35] said he ascended he went and preached to
[58:37] the souls that were in prison that
[58:38] repented not in the longsuffering of the
[58:40] days of Noah amen his soul his Spirit
[58:44] his theophany of his own being went down
[58:46] right amen didn't we say Genesis 126 was
[58:50] theophany
[58:53] righten I've said many times times
[58:54] before maybe this will help you again
[58:56] you've already been to Hell right you
[58:58] ain't got to go no more amen exactly you
[59:02] went down there and got the keys from
[59:03] the devil right in that theophany form
[59:06] it listen we can't be a second person
[59:09] right
[59:10] right his theophany of his own being
[59:12] went down let's follow him would you
[59:14] like tonight to follow him a few minutes
[59:15] let's see where he went then we kept on
[59:17] going but let's read Revelations right
[59:19] here now we'll go back to the same
[59:20] quote that we read before but we we're
[59:23] going to go down to the the red letter
[59:25] part go to the number seven well
[59:28] actually actually it's number right
[59:31] there just leave it right there now our
[59:33] Kinsman has handed a seven seal book of
[59:34] redemption from the original owner
[59:36] original owner when we lost it in the
[59:38] Garden of Eden through Adam it went back
[59:39] to the original owner but there's been a
[59:41] poacher on the land a squatter and
[59:43] that's Satan he came over he's a poacher
[59:45] this Earth don't belong to him belongs
[59:46] to God but he's a poacher a squatter man
[59:49] how could I say something right here but
[59:50] I better not it's it's the title deed of
[59:52] our Redemption this seven seal book it's
[59:54] the deed you wait till we get into those
[59:56] seals now here's the rest of the quote
[59:58] that I didn't put at first he breaks the
[1:00:00] seals reveals gives us his inheritance
[1:00:03] to his people right he gives the
[1:00:05] inheritance that he inherited amen right
[1:00:09] becoming kinsman redeemer and freely
[1:00:11] gives it out to
[1:00:13] us it all belonged to him he was the one
[1:00:17] who redeemed but instead of keeping it
[1:00:20] himself he gives it back to the people
[1:00:23] amen that's his
[1:00:25] love for us now number seven
[1:00:28] am now we know how you and I came forth
[1:00:30] but I um I want you to see this in the
[1:00:34] sman church
[1:00:36] age see how this works God always had
[1:00:39] his thoughts for Adam Adam as his
[1:00:42] thoughts as yet unexpressed right Psalms
[1:00:45] 139:1 15-6 will give you a little idea
[1:00:48] of this my substance was not hid from
[1:00:50] thee when I was made in secret and
[1:00:52] curiously WR in the lowest parts of the
[1:00:54] earth Thine Eyes did see my substance
[1:00:58] yet being unperfect and in thy book were
[1:01:00] all my members
[1:01:02] written which in continuance were
[1:01:04] fashion when as yet there was none of
[1:01:06] them in other words God knew it he knew
[1:01:08] who you'd be wrote it in the book and
[1:01:11] then in continuance or in succession you
[1:01:13] came forth right Glory that as I said
[1:01:17] was not written about Adam but it gives
[1:01:19] you the idea and knowledge that the
[1:01:21] thought was there in his mind and that
[1:01:23] thought was eternal and had to be
[1:01:26] expressed so when Adam was formed of the
[1:01:29] Dust of the earth and his spiritual
[1:01:31] being created by God then Adam became
[1:01:34] God's thought expressed and those
[1:01:36] Eternal thoughts were now manifested
[1:01:38] amen everybody with that say
[1:01:40] Amen wake
[1:01:44] up now it says that he has wait a minute
[1:01:48] down through the centuries we could go
[1:01:50] we find a Moses a Jeremiah John the
[1:01:52] Baptist you got that yep John the
[1:01:55] Baptist each one of these were God's
[1:01:56] Eternal thoughts expressed in its season
[1:01:58] then we come to Jesus the logos he was a
[1:02:01] perfect and complete thought expressed
[1:02:03] and he became known as the word that is
[1:02:06] what he is and forever will be amen now
[1:02:10] it says that he has chosen Us in him
[1:02:13] Jesus before the foundation of the world
[1:02:16] that means that we were right there with
[1:02:18] him in the mind and thoughts of God
[1:02:20] before the foundation of the world that
[1:02:23] gives an eternal quality
[1:02:25] that's
[1:02:26] right amen Eternal
[1:02:29] quality to the elect you can't get away
[1:02:32] from
[1:02:34] that amen amen amen you can't get away
[1:02:38] from it that's right there's the DNA of
[1:02:40] God there's his children that's the on
[1:02:42] that's going to be made manifest that's
[1:02:44] right now let's read number
[1:02:47] eight it's a good book to read here
[1:02:50] Oneness with God now watch brother R
[1:02:53] explain this
[1:02:55] if you'll notice how that Eve was United
[1:02:56] with Adam she became part of him God did
[1:03:00] you notice in Genesis 1:27 he created
[1:03:02] man male and female created he them now
[1:03:05] the man was both male and female when it
[1:03:07] come to being in the spirit of feminist
[1:03:08] and masculine then God took from his
[1:03:11] side a rib did you notice the body part
[1:03:13] was a byproduct but not the spirit amen
[1:03:17] right everybody understand that
[1:03:19] right the body part of the woman was a
[1:03:23] byproduct after the creation had been
[1:03:26] finished God took from the side of Adam
[1:03:29] a rib and made a woman but not the
[1:03:31] spirit the spirit was part of
[1:03:34] Adam for he was both man and woman
[1:03:37] spiritually speaking both masculine and
[1:03:41] feminis so actually Adam and Eve like I
[1:03:44] said before had the same DNA they were
[1:03:47] they actually come from the same body
[1:03:50] amen now if that was in
[1:03:52] Eden and to be redeemed we got to get
[1:03:55] back to that that's right now like what
[1:03:58] somebody said one time said you know in
[1:03:59] the Garden of Eden God closed up the
[1:04:02] womb the wound that Adam had remember
[1:04:06] the Bible said he closed the W closed
[1:04:08] the wound up and made Eve well now when
[1:04:11] Christ hung at Calvary he was pierced in
[1:04:13] aside the bride got out and left it open
[1:04:17] so the bride could get back in cuz we
[1:04:19] got to be bone of his bone and flesh of
[1:04:20] his flesh not in the same way as me in
[1:04:24] June right that's right you can't do
[1:04:27] that cuz that's not restoration that's
[1:04:28] not redeeming right amen redeeming is
[1:04:31] not me and her going back as separate
[1:04:33] people right right everybody understand
[1:04:35] what I'm saying amen when he says bone
[1:04:37] to my bone and flesh to my flesh you
[1:04:39] better know we got to mean
[1:04:42] that all right let's
[1:04:47] watch paragraph 20 now don't you see
[1:04:49] that great picture we and flesh are
[1:04:53] different absolutely we have Jun and I
[1:04:56] have total different DNA because we come
[1:04:58] from two different families but now
[1:05:00] remember we're like a byproduct a
[1:05:02] created being by holy wedlock but in
[1:05:05] spirit we are Sons and Daughters not
[1:05:07] some other spirit amen but the spirit of
[1:05:10] the Living God we are in his likeness in
[1:05:13] his unity in the perfect image of the
[1:05:16] Living God because we become Sons and
[1:05:18] Daughters not separated but the Same
[1:05:21] Spirit the same God the same person
[1:05:23] joined wedlock to the Eternal right amen
[1:05:27] see how God planned it that we should be
[1:05:29] not a different but him that's right not
[1:05:32] some other being of some other tribe but
[1:05:35] a real Union and offspring of the
[1:05:38] almighty Glory done by a holy Union not
[1:05:42] a sex Union but a holy Union not the
[1:05:46] body comes from mother and father but
[1:05:48] the spirit comes from God God separating
[1:05:50] himself as Adam was
[1:05:52] separated on the day of Pentecost we
[1:05:54] find the Holy Spirit the pillar of fire
[1:05:56] separating itself and setting upon each
[1:05:58] member of that church God putting
[1:06:00] himself together
[1:06:03] amen we were separated in a
[1:06:05] garden he couldn't say she's born oh oh
[1:06:08] sure he knew we were born of his born of
[1:06:10] Flesh of his flesh but there's no way we
[1:06:12] could coincide with that there's no way
[1:06:14] we could come without here the new birth
[1:06:17] is what changes us
[1:06:19] amen right right Paul said follow me in
[1:06:23] the Regeneration what does regeneration
[1:06:24] mean mean
[1:06:26] reged you're not the son of Charles
[1:06:28] andell Branham or Samuel Peggy Dale
[1:06:30] you're being
[1:06:32] reged and then the scripture says we'll
[1:06:34] have a body like his glorious body
[1:06:36] brother R said we changed in the atoms
[1:06:38] guess what we're going to people we're
[1:06:40] going to have the same DNA Christ
[1:06:43] had thank you
[1:06:46] Lord on the day of Pentecost we find the
[1:06:48] Holy Spirit the pillar of fire
[1:06:49] separating itself and setting upon each
[1:06:51] member of the church God put God putting
[1:06:53] himself together
[1:06:54] then with that group of people together
[1:06:56] what does it do brings back the unified
[1:06:58] body of the Lord Jesus coming together
[1:07:01] and today in this great separation that
[1:07:02] we're living in denominational
[1:07:04] differences in this message and things
[1:07:06] what a Pity what a disgrace joined in
[1:07:09] Heavenly wedlock to the Eternal God part
[1:07:11] of him part of God in flesh I become
[1:07:14] brandom because of my father brandom you
[1:07:16] become part of your father and mother
[1:07:17] but in spirit we become in Union with
[1:07:19] God is part of God that's the reason
[1:07:22] that the spirit cannot die he the
[1:07:24] believeth on me as everlasting life and
[1:07:25] in the image that he is here on Earth
[1:07:27] and in his likeness I'll raise him up in
[1:07:30] the last days not a spirit being for
[1:07:33] we'll have a body like God's glorious
[1:07:35] body the glorified body of the Lord
[1:07:38] Jesus raised up in that image right
[1:07:43] amen right sure God took a picture of it
[1:07:45] 20 years
[1:07:47] old but it was his genetics he was
[1:07:49] looking at right not your genetics of
[1:07:52] your mom and daddy right
[1:07:56] is that what he just said and if we're
[1:07:58] going to be if for we'll have a body to
[1:08:01] light God's glorious body the glorified
[1:08:03] body of the Lord Jesus raised up in that
[1:08:06] image sure we're going to look the same
[1:08:09] this is what God like cuz this is what
[1:08:10] he
[1:08:11] made but that image is going to be it's
[1:08:14] not going to be to me I say it won't be
[1:08:16] an image it'll be him made manifest in
[1:08:17] another form
[1:08:20] exactly cuz Eve was Adam made manifest
[1:08:23] in another form
[1:08:25] amen she said had the same body he had
[1:08:28] so if we don't have the same body that's
[1:08:30] why Paul says be
[1:08:32] conformed to the image being transformed
[1:08:36] by the renewing of his mind that's what
[1:08:38] that's what my dad said last night he
[1:08:39] said he said we got a long way to go
[1:08:42] Amen to get to that place right amen but
[1:08:45] God can do it in a hurry right amen cuz
[1:08:48] if you pull it out God will bring it
[1:08:50] right now
[1:08:52] look
[1:08:56] Let's do let's go to the last one let's
[1:08:58] let's skip the church ages let's do this
[1:08:59] we got communion
[1:09:01] today we had a chance to take communion
[1:09:03] in a couple of churches and that was
[1:09:05] that was really a treat so but we miss
[1:09:07] it here in our
[1:09:09] family spiritual Amnesia 1964 this is
[1:09:12] the last quote but we're going to read a
[1:09:14] little bit so bear with me now to be a
[1:09:17] true Christian you have to be the same
[1:09:19] we don't want to forget that all that he
[1:09:21] was I'm identified with him I'm
[1:09:22] identified with him
[1:09:24] notice and he is in me and I in him
[1:09:27] notice then every Christian that's a
[1:09:28] real genuine genuine Christian Christian
[1:09:31] was with him when the morning Stars sang
[1:09:33] together and the sons of God shouted for
[1:09:34] Joy before there was a foundation of the
[1:09:36] world we were identified in the immortal
[1:09:39] Realms with God 10 million years before
[1:09:42] the world was ever formed right I was
[1:09:44] back there with him if I got eternal
[1:09:47] life that's what the people don't like
[1:09:49] that word if he said if you got eternal
[1:09:52] life that eternal life always was
[1:09:54] eternal not the you not you but that
[1:09:57] eternal life we got to be identified
[1:09:59] with that if I got eternal life I was
[1:10:01] there with him I was identified with him
[1:10:04] when the morning Stars s together and
[1:10:05] the sons of God shouted for Joy I was
[1:10:07] with with him when he called Abraham
[1:10:09] right
[1:10:12] MDC brother Brown said every son of the
[1:10:14] faith going to take the same Journey as
[1:10:15] Abraham we got to meet
[1:10:17] MDC amen you say meet your own theophany
[1:10:20] you got to meet God Amen and if you stay
[1:10:24] on the tree of knowledge of Good and
[1:10:26] Evil that means God's Not In
[1:10:31] You
[1:10:34] Hallelujah I was with him when he called
[1:10:36] Abraham at the age of 75 and his wife 65
[1:10:38] and told him they were going to have a
[1:10:39] baby I was with him when he took his
[1:10:41] stand upon thus sayeth the Lord I'm
[1:10:43] going to have the baby I stood with him
[1:10:45] every other Christian stood with him I
[1:10:47] was with him when his Temptations come
[1:10:49] it ain't all the good parts I was with
[1:10:52] him when he went up on top of the
[1:10:54] mountain to offer Isaac I was with him
[1:10:55] when the ram appeared I was with Joseph
[1:10:58] when he was rejected of his brothers cuz
[1:11:00] he was spiritual and the rest of them
[1:11:01] was carnal I was with him when he know
[1:11:04] the reproach he had to stand by his own
[1:11:06] Brothers what he was I am what I am he
[1:11:09] was for we all one in Christ Jesus I was
[1:11:12] with Joseph in his cave grave I was with
[1:11:15] him when he went to the right hand of
[1:11:16] pharaoh you had to be identified with
[1:11:18] him I was with Jacob that night when he
[1:11:20] wrestled all night with the angel I've
[1:11:22] wrestled myself I know what went through
[1:11:24] with have
[1:11:27] you if you're not then you're not
[1:11:29] identified with him right so I wrestled
[1:11:32] with Jacob the same time he did for I am
[1:11:34] his brother I was with Moses when he
[1:11:36] went down into Egypt I was Moses at the
[1:11:38] burning bush if you're a Christian
[1:11:39] you're identified within Bible
[1:11:41] characters don't forget it I was with
[1:11:43] Moses when all the people turned against
[1:11:44] him I was with Moses when he crossed the
[1:11:46] Red Sea when he raised his hand walked
[1:11:48] forward and the Red Sea opened I was
[1:11:49] identified in Christ right then and I
[1:11:51] was with Moses at that hour what every
[1:11:54] Christian has been what every believer
[1:11:56] has been every believer now is
[1:11:58] identified with that same person
[1:12:00] whatever it is you must be identified
[1:12:02] don't forget that when you do you've got
[1:12:05] spiritual Amnesia you've forgotten who
[1:12:07] you are right now identified with him
[1:12:10] with Moses when he crossed the sea I was
[1:12:12] with Elijah in the days of Ahab when
[1:12:14] they had to make a choice when they who
[1:12:16] they would serve God or baam was with
[1:12:18] him on Mount carel when he had to make a
[1:12:20] choice for we identified in the body of
[1:12:22] the same God that he was identified in
[1:12:24] so if we're identified in that body then
[1:12:27] we must we must
[1:12:30] remember we were there with him right
[1:12:33] now I was with David when he was
[1:12:35] rejected by his own Brethren I was with
[1:12:36] David you were too if you're a Christian
[1:12:38] you have to be identified in his
[1:12:39] rejection I was with the Hebrew children
[1:12:41] in a fiery furnace when the fire didn't
[1:12:42] burn them because of the presence of the
[1:12:44] fourth man I was with Daniel in the
[1:12:46] Lion's Den I was identified in there
[1:12:47] when the angel of the Lord identified
[1:12:49] him in there I was most certainly surely
[1:12:51] with him at Calvary I must be identified
[1:12:54] with him at Calvary I must be there to
[1:12:56] place that where not also was I
[1:12:58] identified with him at Calvary I died
[1:13:00] with him at Calvary every Christian must
[1:13:03] die with him at Calvary if you don't die
[1:13:04] with him at Calvary you can't be none of
[1:13:06] his I was there when he died I died with
[1:13:08] him and then when I was with him then I
[1:13:10] was with him when he raised up from the
[1:13:12] dead I came up on Easter morning with
[1:13:13] him in the resurrection whatever he did
[1:13:16] I was right there with him ever believer
[1:13:18] was the same and now I'm seated with him
[1:13:20] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus with
[1:13:22] all the powers of hell conquered through
[1:13:24] him every Christian believer was seated
[1:13:26] the same way cuz you have to be
[1:13:28] identified now I find myself in this
[1:13:30] last days with many of the believing
[1:13:31] Christians identified in his ministry
[1:13:33] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:13:35] forever I find myself in this day
[1:13:36] identified in his ministry do you find
[1:13:38] yourself that way believe it walking
[1:13:41] with it notice the works that he did he
[1:13:43] said the believer would do the same The
[1:13:44] Works that I do shall you do also then
[1:13:46] can you be identified with him then when
[1:13:48] the reproach comes on the word Can You
[1:13:50] Stand The reproach like he did say
[1:13:51] identified with him I was identified
[1:13:53] with him I was with him at the day of
[1:13:55] Pentecost I was with the disciples up
[1:13:57] there identified with them in the
[1:13:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost we must be
[1:14:01] with the disciples at Pentecost
[1:14:03] identified with them I was identified
[1:14:05] with Peter's sermon on the day of
[1:14:06] Pentecost in Acts 2 2 chapter I heard
[1:14:08] what he
[1:14:11] said amen amen that's right I heard what
[1:14:14] he said didn't
[1:14:16] you I heard what he
[1:14:20] said I believe what he said
[1:14:24] I obeyed what he
[1:14:25] said now I'm identified in the same
[1:14:28] thing sitting together in Heavenly
[1:14:29] places in Christ Jesus amen my last
[1:14:32] statement is
[1:14:34] look the word Quicken now not just the
[1:14:36] word you can have the word every day of
[1:14:38] your life and and be just like cus cus
[1:14:41] had the word right but the word quick
[1:14:44] and refreshes our memory that's right
[1:14:46] amen let me say that one more time the
[1:14:49] word quickened refreshes our memory
[1:14:52] right
[1:14:54] so I was with David uh we were talking
[1:14:56] this morning about um patience and
[1:14:59] things like that you got to be
[1:15:01] identified that's not that's some people
[1:15:03] just have regular patience but that's
[1:15:06] Godly patience those virtues are Godly
[1:15:08] virtues there's something that God put
[1:15:10] in you it's not something that you know
[1:15:12] I was telling them that we we have a u a
[1:15:15] family that that's around home there
[1:15:16] that's that's identified with fighting
[1:15:18] and being rough and and and their name
[1:15:21] I'm not going to call their name but uh
[1:15:24] everybody knows when you say the name
[1:15:28] blank It's associated with fighting well
[1:15:31] see that's that's a characteristic that
[1:15:32] came down through in the people now the
[1:15:35] new birth will take care of that right
[1:15:37] but you're still going to fight that
[1:15:38] probably worse than some other people
[1:15:40] fights it because you got that nature in
[1:15:42] you that works against you but the word
[1:15:44] Quicken refreshes our memory and brings
[1:15:46] us back to where we have Godly patience
[1:15:48] not just the patience of man is what my
[1:15:50] point is not just the patience of man
[1:15:52] not the temperance of man but the
[1:15:53] temperance of God right the patience of
[1:15:56] God God had enough patience with you
[1:15:57] didn't he then why don't we have enough
[1:16:00] patience with others God had enough
[1:16:02] patience with you that little saying
[1:16:04] I've got in the back of my Bible God
[1:16:05] never ask you why you came or how long
[1:16:08] it took you to came to come he just say
[1:16:10] enter into the joy of the Lord he's not
[1:16:12] going to fuss about it took you 20 years
[1:16:14] to get here that's right and you're not
[1:16:16] going to be setting higher than the guy
[1:16:18] that got here 5 years ago you know we
[1:16:20] all going to be equal so God's not going
[1:16:22] to ask that he's just going to say enter
[1:16:23] into the joy of the Lord before the
[1:16:25] foundation of the world but I was
[1:16:26] thinking about what daddy said this
[1:16:27] morning he said that um that we that the
[1:16:32] prophet only has thus sayith the Lord
[1:16:33] and that's true but you know what we
[1:16:40] have the Book of Mark right says ask
[1:16:44] what you
[1:16:46] will amen that's right brother Bown
[1:16:50] never said thus sayth the Lord to sister
[1:16:53] uh MAA he never said thus sayth the Lord
[1:16:55] to uh to hady right he said you say
[1:17:00] right you say brother brandham what are
[1:17:04] you hunting hunting squirrels he said
[1:17:06] speak he didn't say say thus sayith the
[1:17:08] Lord he said speak because it was the
[1:17:10] Lord speaking amen right it was the Lord
[1:17:13] doing the speaking so once our
[1:17:15] commission as a bride of Jesus Christ we
[1:17:17] should have thus sayith the Lord or sit
[1:17:19] still like I said we've got the
[1:17:21] prophet not just the Prophet William
[1:17:23] Brandon we've got the prophet amen we've
[1:17:26] got the prophet the big th the Big T the
[1:17:29] prophet see we got that and we can say
[1:17:32] that we can we know what thus sayth the
[1:17:33] Lord is that's right but we don't have
[1:17:36] to say thus sayith the Lord
[1:17:38] on the Bible says you say right what you
[1:17:42] say you call for your kids you call for
[1:17:45] the mountain to be moved you call for
[1:17:47] this you call for that let's stand you
[1:17:51] love the Lord
[1:17:54] that's why we need to Quicken word
[1:17:56] people because what it does it refreshes
[1:17:57] it brings our brings our memory back we
[1:18:00] brother B said and I read the quotes
[1:18:02] that we read before it in the uhu um the
[1:18:05] sermons we had before this let me see if
[1:18:07] I can find it real quick where he says
[1:18:09] Adam after the
[1:18:11] fall
[1:18:12] Adam's senses were
[1:18:16] darkened and that's what happened Adam's
[1:18:18] senses were darkened why were they
[1:18:20] darkened because they they're FL he got
[1:18:23] flu stopped up right amen magicians come
[1:18:26] on well we're going to take communion so
[1:18:29] Daddy get ready to to do the I want to
[1:18:32] see if I can find that quote real quick
[1:18:35] hang on just a
[1:18:44] second I'll find it next time but uh
[1:18:48] that's what it says I mean that's what
[1:18:50] he told that's what he says so right
[1:18:53] you lose your mind that's right brother
[1:18:55] dick we should lose our mind but see if
[1:18:59] we if we have our own human mind we'll
[1:19:01] lean to our own understanding we'll lean
[1:19:03] to the things of the world we'll lean to
[1:19:05] that tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:19:08] but once we get on the tree of life you
[1:19:10] know here's Paul saying transform by the
[1:19:13] renewing of your mind what that's what I
[1:19:15] said about the word quickens it
[1:19:16] refreshes or renews our memory that we
[1:19:19] can identify with David we can identify
[1:19:21] with all those people in the Old
[1:19:22] Testament definitely identify with the
[1:19:24] ones in the New Testament but you know
[1:19:26] what they all spoke
[1:19:28] of right here right they want to be
[1:19:32] identified with you actually right they
[1:19:34] want to be known as we're known that
[1:19:37] we're the last ones we stood in I said
[1:19:40] before um Satan went over into God's
[1:19:42] perfect Eden and messed it up now God's
[1:19:45] come over here into Satan's perfect Eden
[1:19:47] and messing him
[1:19:49] up right under Satan's nose the Bride of
[1:19:52] Jesus Jesus Christ will
[1:19:55] prevail I love you time to take
[1:20:03] communion enjoy the message
[1:20:09] amen but I believe it don't
[1:20:13] you you know we can lean on the tree of
[1:20:17] knowledge of Good and Evil we need to
[1:20:18] get off of it and climb up on the tree
[1:20:21] of life and not lean on am then we can
[1:20:24] be all right can we amen tell our
[1:20:26] brother how much you appreciate the
[1:20:28] message because we believe it remember
[1:20:29] brother forny be with us wday pray the
[1:20:31] Lord would bless and guide each one okay
[1:20:34] let's go right into our scriptures in 1
[1:20:36] Corinthians
[1:20:38] 11 for I have received of the Lord that
[1:20:40] which also I delivered unto you that the
[1:20:42] Lord Jesus the same night in which he
[1:20:44] was betrayed took bread and when he had
[1:20:46] given thanks he break it and said take
[1:20:48] eat this is my body which is broken for
[1:20:51] you for you this doing in remembrance of
[1:20:53] me after the same manner also he took
[1:20:56] the cup when he had s saying this cup is
[1:20:58] the New Testament in my blood this do ye
[1:21:01] as often as you drink it in remembrance
[1:21:02] of me for as often as you eat this bread
[1:21:05] and drink this cup you do sh the Lord's
[1:21:07] death till he come wherefore whosoever
[1:21:10] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:21:12] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[1:21:14] of the body and blood of the Lord but
[1:21:16] let a man examine himself and so let him
[1:21:18] eat of that bread and drink of that cup
[1:21:20] for he that eateth and drinketh un
[1:21:22] worthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[1:21:24] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[1:21:27] body for this cause many are weak and
[1:21:29] sickly among you and many sleep for if
[1:21:32] we would judge ourselves we should not
[1:21:34] be judged I love this scripture but when
[1:21:37] we are judged we are chasten to the Lord
[1:21:41] that we should not be condemned with the
[1:21:42] world wherefore my brethren when you
[1:21:45] come together to eat ter one for another
[1:21:47] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[1:21:49] home that you come not together under
[1:21:51] condemnation and the rest will I set in
[1:21:54] order when I
[1:21:56] come communion is a great thing is
[1:21:59] it even so much until what the last
[1:22:03] message the prophet preached before his
[1:22:06] passing on was the communion because he
[1:22:08] wanted to leave us I guess the Lord did
[1:22:10] with something that would tie together
[1:22:13] with all of us and we could know about
[1:22:16] communion and what it is and what they
[1:22:18] call communion there
[1:22:21] Fellowship Fellowship
[1:22:23] with the Lord right that's communion
[1:22:26] right not just the bread and the wine
[1:22:28] that's that's good but Fellowship in in
[1:22:30] the word amen so what the Bible says
[1:22:33] that they car one for another let's just
[1:22:35] take a few moments and just have a
[1:22:37] silent prayer praying one for another
[1:22:39] you pray for me I pray for you we all
[1:22:42] pray that the Lord would bless us and
[1:22:44] keep us and guide us as we go about each
[1:22:51] day
[1:22:59] we thank you Lord for this day and your
[1:23:01] love unto us we thank you for the word
[1:23:03] that we've heard and now we thank you
[1:23:05] for an opportunity to be able to
[1:23:07] continue into that word that we find
[1:23:10] what that word is saying unto us and see
[1:23:13] that there's a communion to be taken and
[1:23:15] Lord we have the ability to understand
[1:23:18] how it is now of what it's to be not
[1:23:20] just some little grape juice and a soda
[1:23:23] cracker but yet to be set aside
[1:23:26] specifically for you Lord we love you
[1:23:29] and we thank you sanctify the partakers
[1:23:32] and Lord all of us together as one in
[1:23:34] you in Jesus name
[1:23:40] amen the Bible said he took bread and
[1:23:42] blessed it father we thank you for this
[1:23:44] bread it was made for this purpose today
[1:23:47] and now we ask you to sanctify yes
[1:23:50] because lord it's in representation not
[1:23:52] in reality a representation of your body
[1:23:55] which was shed for each and every one of
[1:23:57] us we ask you to just sanctify the bread
[1:24:00] and the partakers in Jesus
[1:24:13] name when it comes down to this part
[1:24:16] then we're supposed to be out of the way
[1:24:20] right this was in the upper room right
[1:24:23] this was not something that he would
[1:24:24] discuss with his
[1:24:26] disciples it was something that he told
[1:24:28] them he instituted and said all right
[1:24:31] now you do
[1:24:32] this you and we do it some have even
[1:24:36] gotten so that are so spiritual until
[1:24:38] they quit taking communion because they
[1:24:40] believe the Lord was here but according
[1:24:42] to the scriptures we're to take the
[1:24:44] communion until he comes right well if
[1:24:47] he's here physically then we're in bad
[1:24:50] shape we know he's here SP spiritually
[1:24:53] through the opening of the word we thank
[1:24:55] God for that we heard him just now as he
[1:24:58] spoke to us to our brother as to the
[1:25:02] word being
[1:25:04] revealed but yet there will be a
[1:25:06] physical
[1:25:07] part of a coming that can take us out of
[1:25:12] here we believe that we thank
[1:25:18] you we were asking some last night I
[1:25:20] told him when we're out and
[1:25:22] in Colorado hunting that time and we
[1:25:25] couldn't find no place to go to church I
[1:25:28] said go on down
[1:25:30] to anything we can find but we couldn't
[1:25:33] find one in that town I said find a
[1:25:35] Catholic Church I ain't never been to
[1:25:39] mass but I'll go in and sit down and
[1:25:41] watch him I think the wait or somebody
[1:25:44] said would you would you have taken the
[1:25:47] the communion I said nope I wouldn't
[1:25:50] have done that but that have been a
[1:25:51] little too far
[1:25:55] father we thank you for this wine that's
[1:25:57] made for this purpose today and Lord we
[1:26:00] know that it represents your blood which
[1:26:01] was shed for each and every one of us
[1:26:04] because a life Lord F flowing through
[1:26:06] the blood we love you and we thank you
[1:26:08] sanctify the wine and the partakers make
[1:26:11] us all together as one in you in Jesus

[1:28:19] willing to get out and help and do
[1:28:20] things you know and bringing him chicken

[1:28:25] liked that he likes dark meat and they
[1:28:28] they must have known that you know I
[1:28:29] don't know whether he had a sign up in
[1:28:31] the window that says if you bring me
[1:28:33] Kentucky Fried make it dark meat but he
[1:28:36] got his dark meat cuz that's what he
[1:28:38] said it he he did but if you want to
[1:28:40] read it he has some testimonies are made
[1:28:42] of it so we we appreciate
[1:28:51] it
[1:28:56] brother Joe also gave me a copy of a a
[1:29:00] little something that if he would if he
[1:29:02] could run off a good many of them and
[1:29:04] just let everybody have it and it it was

[1:29:20] it and uh everything it's bringing out
[1:29:24] some wonderful words written by someone
[1:29:26] I think on back good time before but yet
[1:29:30] it was found
[1:29:46] there brother Bob had a pretty good
[1:29:48] testimony too he got to walk for 4 and
[1:29:52] 1/2
[1:29:53] miles he said it was good said he
[1:29:55] enjoyed being

[1:30:01] stroll 4 and a half mile
[1:30:03] stroll it was
[1:30:10] good
[1:30:12] amen let's all partake
[1:30:20] together
[1:30:25] you can be seated while we get ready for
[1:30:28] the foot
[1:30:35] washing you know we come down to the
[1:30:37] time of the foot washing and we think
[1:30:40] about it and a lot of people you know
[1:30:42] they
[1:30:43] won't don't maybe don't want to partake
[1:30:45] of it but that's all right but it's it's
[1:30:48] a great thing for me but I do remember
[1:30:51] in the scripture there that you're not
[1:30:53] even to receive a sister into
[1:30:55] the body without her being you know
[1:30:58] having washed the Saints feet now not
[1:31:00] the men you know but women wash the
[1:31:02] women's feet the men wash the men's feet
[1:31:05] but it is a great thing to to partake of
[1:31:08] and I I appreciate
[1:31:09] it and supper being ended the devil
[1:31:12] having now put into the heart of Judas
[1:31:13] his carrot Simon son to betray him Jesus
[1:31:16] knowing that the father had given all
[1:31:18] things into his hands and that he was
[1:31:20] come from God and went to God he rised
[1:31:22] from supper and laid aside his garments
[1:31:24] and took a towel and GED
[1:31:26] himself after that he poured water into
[1:31:28] a basin and began to wash the disciples
[1:31:30] feet and to wipe them with a towel
[1:31:33] wherewith he was girded then cometh he
[1:31:35] to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him
[1:31:37] Lord do thou wash my feet Jesus answered
[1:31:40] and said unto him what I do thou knowest
[1:31:42] not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter
[1:31:45] Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never
[1:31:47] wash my feet Jesus answered him if I
[1:31:49] wash thee not thou Hast no part with me
[1:31:53] Simon Peter Sith unto him Lord not my
[1:31:55] feet only but also my hands and my head
[1:31:58] Jesus Sith unto him he that is washed
[1:32:01] needeth not saved to wash his feet but
[1:32:03] is clean every with and you are clean
[1:32:06] but not
[1:32:07] all for he knew who should betray him
[1:32:10] therefore said he you are not all clean
[1:32:13] therefore he so after he had washed
[1:32:15] their feet and had taken his garments
[1:32:18] and was set down again he said unto them
[1:32:20] know you what I have done to you you
[1:32:22] call me master and Lord and you say well
[1:32:24] for so I am if I then your Lord and
[1:32:27] Master have washed your feet you also
[1:32:29] ought to wash one another's feet for I
[1:32:31] have given you an example that you
[1:32:33] should do as I have done to you verily
[1:32:35] verily I say unto you the servant and is
[1:32:38] not greater than his Lord neither he
[1:32:40] that is sent greater than he that sent
[1:32:42] him if you know these things happy are
[1:32:45] ye if you do them let's all stand and
[1:32:48] we'll be dismissed and we'll tell you
[1:32:51] kind of a funny thing one time we had a
[1:32:53] problem here that we had some sisters
[1:32:57] that they didn't want to take off their
[1:32:59] hose and uh you know they wanted to have
[1:33:03] foot washing with their hoses on or what
[1:33:05] you call them you know panty hoses or
[1:33:07] what you call all that
[1:33:09] stuff and someone said something to me
[1:33:11] about it and I said you just tell them
[1:33:13] and I come right here and I said look we
[1:33:15] we we have foot washing we don't have
[1:33:18] clothes
[1:33:19] washing if you need any clothes wash
[1:33:21] them bring and I take them home my wife
[1:33:23] and put them in the washing machine
[1:33:24] right you know so but we did have that I
[1:33:28] never didn't know how all that turned
[1:33:30] out but cuz I'm not interested in that
[1:33:32] part of it but that is a point right
[1:33:35] father we thank you and we ask you to
[1:33:37] just be with us and bless us as we go on
[1:33:39] into the furtherment of the service now
[1:33:41] and how the foot washing Lord and then
[1:33:43] just be with each and every one of us on
[1:33:45] the way home give everybody a safe
[1:33:47] journey we believe you we heard the word
[1:33:49] today and in your word we've read it
[1:33:52] says that he would you would send your
[1:33:55] word and heal us and Deliver Us from
[1:33:58] destruction so then whatever we have
[1:34:00] need of is already taken care of we'll
[1:34:01] just hear your word and say thank you
[1:34:03] for it we love you and we thank you in
[1:34:06] Jesus name amen amen you're
[1:34:11] dismissed
