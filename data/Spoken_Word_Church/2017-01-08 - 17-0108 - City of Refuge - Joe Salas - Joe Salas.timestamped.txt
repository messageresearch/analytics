[7:59] Webster said Refuge is uh shelter or
[8:02] protection from danger or distress and
[8:06] means a resort for help and difficulty
[8:10] then skolfield say the City of Refuge
[8:12] are types of Christ Sheltering The
[8:14] Sinner from
[8:16] judgment but for us at any City in city
[8:20] right right
[8:22] yes so the Lord spake unto Moses saying
[8:25] Comm the children of Israel that they
[8:27] give to the Levites 48 cities to dwell
[8:31] in and out of the Cities you shall make
[8:33] six cities a refuge
[8:36] right in the Old Testament it was a nine
[8:39] for n and a Toth for the
[8:42] Toth I don't want to get up the subject
[8:44] but I wish it was today I mean almost
[8:47] some countries they uh if you steal
[8:50] something they cut your hand you steal
[8:51] again they cut your other hand so maybe
[8:54] they won't be so many innocent people
[8:55] get killed sorry throw that in that's
[8:58] okay
[9:04] in the message uh ler out the pressure
[9:07] brother says that now in the Old
[9:10] Testament God seen in some of this
[9:13] trouble actually accidentally done so if
[9:17] you're innocent and not guilty God makes
[9:19] a way for
[9:20] you now if a man kill a man just that
[9:24] liberally pred premeditated he was lost
[9:27] he could not come to this place
[9:30] but if he did it accidentally he didn't
[9:32] mean to do it then there was a City of
[9:35] Refuge one was at Raman Gilead and four
[9:38] places I think Joshua placed the cities
[9:41] a refuge now that people not could not
[9:44] come to the City of Refuge if
[9:47] accidentally he done some something
[9:49] wrong he didn't mean to he would come to
[9:51] the City of Refuge and go to the gate
[9:55] the gatekeeper would ask him why he
[9:57] can't he was coming what was his idea of
[10:00] coming then his case was pleed and when
[10:04] his case was pleed at the gate and a man
[10:06] be found innocent he did it not
[10:09] willfully then the man was taken into
[10:11] the city as a place of Refuge then the
[10:14] enemy could not get him and if he lied
[10:17] and done wrong and come into the City of
[10:20] Refuge though he was holding to the
[10:22] altar of horns his enemy had a the
[10:25] privilege and right to drag him from the
[10:29] Altar and kill him yes sir because he
[10:31] was guilty pre premeditated and he had
[10:35] to be
[10:37] [Music]
[10:40] punished I was asking brother waade
[10:42] about
[10:43] Cain
[10:46] uh Cain could not come to the City of
[10:49] Refuge because he refused the
[10:52] sacrifice I think brother BR said
[10:55] uh that Kane said that's all I got take
[10:59] it believe
[11:00] right but uh what about David and uh 2
[11:06] Samuel chapter
[11:08] 1213 and David said unto Nathan I have
[11:11] sinned against the Lord and Nathan said
[11:14] unto
[11:16] David the Lord also had put away your
[11:20] thy sin Thou shalt not
[11:23] die because David was the apple of God's
[11:26] eyes so he could not so he could come to
[11:30] the City of
[11:39] Refuge I still couldn't get him David
[11:42] all that he did and that God loved him
[11:47] yeah and uh Isaiah 322 and a man shall
[11:52] be as a hidden place from the wind and
[11:55] covered from The Tempest a rivers of

[18:38] everybody's all built up hav't haven't
[18:41] got no time that builds up to a place
[18:43] that it breaks up things it causes
[18:45] people to have hard feelings when they
[18:47] snap them out and say things you don't
[18:49] mean to say now everybody's guilty of it
[18:53] I'm guilty you're guilty we do things
[18:55] under pressure that we wouldn't do
[18:57] otherwise so there's
[18:59] and excess pressure building up today I
[19:01] believe before I go on further I may say
[19:05] this I believe it's the enemy coming
[19:07] down and pressuring I believe is the
[19:09] devil right he talks about uh he said
[19:16] about 3 years ago he said he went on a
[19:18] hunting trip with his uh Indian chief so
[19:22] he go
[19:24] uh they start going up the mountain and
[19:27] brother said uh
[19:29] hurry up hurry up they looks up in the m
[19:31] and says
[19:33] uh he said uh too fast slow down so he
[19:37] puts in second gear too fast slow down
[19:39] he puts it in first gear he said oh my I
[19:42] said Chief El is up there and the chief
[19:45] said he said him stay up there he was BN
[19:50] there he won't leave I said I guess
[19:54] that's right yeah
[20:13] he letting off the pressure brother said
[20:15] the man must want to stay in this Refuge
[20:18] it cannot go in there complaining he
[20:21] must want to stay no complaining about
[20:24] it outside he dies inside he safe right
[20:29] he said well I want to say something to
[20:31] the people here if you're not a
[20:32] Christian I come to the City of Refuge
[20:35] about 30 one years ago and brother I
[20:38] never want to go out oh I come into
[20:41] Christ everything that I long for wasn't
[20:44] here I don't want to go out I pray daily
[20:47] oh God I'm so happy here just let me
[20:50] stay I never want to leave I know he
[20:54] he'll never leave me I know he'll never
[20:56] leave me leave you and the pressure gets
[20:59] greater if it does then he is our Outlet
[21:02] so we don't have to worry about
[21:06] it amen he said uh when you go to a City
[21:10] of Refuge you have to come on your own
[21:12] free will and like you said don't be
[21:14] complain that you want to get out once
[21:16] you're in there you got to stay in y
[21:25] yes that's all sorry
[21:28] that's okay well praise the Lord that's
[21:30] good we started too early yeah you
[21:33] didn't start too early you started
[21:36] fine the reason that no sh down we're
[21:39] not finished
[21:42] yet finished yet good job buddy thank
[21:45] you job good job good
[21:52] job it kind of evolved into this but um
[21:56] because of the bad weather yesterday
[21:57] they called me to post office and told
[21:59] me to be on alert for today that I may
[22:00] have to work so that was early in the
[22:03] morning so I called brother Joe to see
[22:05] if he would take over Sunday school
[22:07] class and then I got to thinking they
[22:08] called me at 12:00 and said well you
[22:11] don't have to work today we'll do it all
[22:13] Monday so we're going to do it on Monday
[22:15] but it kind of got me thinking a little
[22:17] bit that it's been a long time since
[22:19] y'all any of the four guys that I got
[22:22] down here has been teaching Sunday
[22:24] school so what I'm going to start doing
[22:26] is is it's quite all right y'all don't
[22:28] have to listen to me the whole quite all
[22:30] right y'all don't have well listen but
[22:32] what we're going to do what we're going
[22:33] to do is is we're going to start once a
[22:36] month one of you four is going to do it
[22:38] in rotation we stared with him so we'll
[22:41] go with Bob and then you and then you
[22:43] but I'm not going to tell you what
[22:45] Sunday until
[22:48] Saturday and then that'll make sure that
[22:51] these people
[22:52] come and they won't know who they're
[22:54] going to hear but once a month you ought
[22:56] to listen to somebody else once a month
[22:57] you you really ought
[22:59] that's right so I'll call you Sunday
[23:03] morning and tell you it's your time how
[23:05] about
[23:06] that even if I have no friendly no
[23:09] understand song Lead won't Che yeah no
[23:13] okay no all you're not leading singing
[23:15] in the morning you a singing in the
[23:18] afternoon I'm thinking about it though
[23:20] that's okay you can come down here and
[23:21] sing a song If you want to that's
[23:22] whatever you want to do but uh but yeah
[23:25] I think we'll we'll start doing that
[23:27] once a month because you know it gets it
[23:31] shouldn't get boring but listen you need
[23:33] different angles we need a fivefold
[23:34] Ministry so we need five you know we
[23:36] need different angles of different
[23:37] things and and we know you know we're on
[23:39] the seals and and uh but maybe bringing
[23:43] something fresh
[23:44] in kind of joging our memory a little
[23:47] bit about certain things you know um and
[23:50] honestly I was thinking a few weeks ago
[23:52] not about City of Refuge but how that
[23:54] we're that we are protected by God in
[23:56] this age we are protected more in this
[23:59] age now this is the most pressure age MH
[24:01] but we're protected by God cuz he give
[24:03] us all the defenses for this age so we
[24:06] don't literally have to run into a
[24:08] defense City but we if we run into the
[24:10] word God's God's going to have to he's
[24:13] going to have to see us St when we get
[24:15] out remember what brother Bown said you
[24:17] if the devil's on you you went out to
[24:19] meet him he didn't come in to get you so
[24:22] what' you do you left that Refuge City
[24:24] that's right you went outside for
[24:25] something that looked tantalizing amen
[24:27] and you didn't get back in the city fast
[24:29] enough or you or he caught you on the
[24:31] way back in but if you'll stay in that
[24:33] defense city which now is the word of
[24:34] God it was literal cities back then I
[24:37] mean like the B if you killed somebody
[24:40] maliciously they dealt with you but if
[24:42] you killed somebody without malice or
[24:44] just happened to be an accident well the
[24:47] Bible
[24:47] says you the brothers have to go kill
[24:50] that you know the family members have to
[24:51] go kill that
[24:53] person without any judgment but but God
[24:56] put up cities there where you can run
[24:57] into that City and they'd keep you there
[24:59] until judgment was passed they couldn't
[25:02] come in and kill you there had to be a
[25:04] judge same thing with God the mercy of
[25:07] God is it's like brother Dale was saying
[25:09] the other
[25:10] night without the shed blood of Jesus
[25:12] Christ this whole world will be
[25:14] annihilated including Christians the
[25:16] Flesh of us would be annihilated right
[25:18] brother R said that red blood he can
[25:20] only hear your voice he can't see you
[25:23] amen so he hears your voice through that
[25:25] blood and but when but remember what is
[25:27] the blood the blood is the bleeding word
[25:29] and now when we lift off the earth and
[25:31] the word the word made flesh goes home
[25:35] there's no more blood amen only for the
[25:37] 144,000 there's there's blood for them
[25:40] but there's no blood atonement for
[25:41] anybody else after we're gone so there
[25:44] is no refuge City then Refuge cities are
[25:47] gone just like the literal Refuge cities
[25:50] are gone there are no refuge cities over
[25:51] there now that people can go to it's all
[25:53] law it's all the the man-written laws
[25:56] right and we see that the manw written
[25:57] laws are written basically from the
[25:59] Bible right somebody said that to
[26:01] brother randam or some some preacher
[26:03] said well we got laws he said your laws
[26:05] come out of the
[26:06] Bible your laws come out of the word of
[26:08] God Refuge City what's a refuge
[26:11] City when a lawyer comes in and your
[26:13] bails paid you're free to go nobody can
[26:15] touch you until they come back in and
[26:18] sit down and have a what a
[26:20] trial so there's a refuge in the law
[26:23] that says nobody can bother you even the
[26:26] state or the federal government can't
[26:27] bother you until you're brought in and
[26:30] you're judged by jury of of your peers
[26:34] and it comes right straight from the
[26:35] Bible I mean why why is it 12
[26:39] jurors 12 tribes of Israel okay the 12 I
[26:44] believe that the 12 tribes of Israel
[26:45] would send a representative and they
[26:47] would judge cuz the tribes of Israel
[26:49] were all over and they would judge those
[26:50] 12 tribes that's why there's 12 people
[26:52] in in a jury they just some some people
[26:54] probably don't know that but right but
[26:56] that's the way it is so
[26:59] but yeah go ahead in Joshua when Joshua
[27:02] talks about it in the Book of Joshua it
[27:05] said the Elders of the city so the
[27:07] people that were the Elders of the
[27:08] Cities of Refuge correct were were
[27:11] appointed to do do that correct and I
[27:14] would say they were appointed one from
[27:15] each tribe because you had 12 it was
[27:17] just strange that it's was 12 and it's
[27:19] 12 tribes of Israel One Elder from each
[27:21] tribe would come and sit at counsel they
[27:23] would present the case if he said death
[27:27] they sent him out if he said hey you did
[27:29] it you know if you did it not
[27:30] maliciously and that's what we consider
[27:32] see we have manslaughter manslaughter is
[27:35] not considered murder as far as
[27:37] premeditated murder but it's that you
[27:38] killed somebody out of a situation in
[27:41] defense or whatever and sometimes you
[27:43] can get convicted of manslaughter and
[27:45] you don't have to go to jail that's
[27:46] right cuz if you kill in self-defense
[27:48] you don't have to go to jail right
[27:49] that's that's the same see where the
[27:50] laws came from then but but now
[27:52] according to the
[27:54] law you kill him we kill you right you
[27:57] know so what was it where it said they
[28:00] got to stay there until the priest
[28:02] died I don't really understand that
[28:05] right quick Aaron does A's got his hand
[28:08] up the Lord showed me that a long time
[28:10] ago and it's one of the most amazing
[28:13] things because when brother I'm talking
[28:15] about a Christian you know you come into
[28:17] Christ which is that City of Refuge but
[28:19] you're here on Earthly Journey but at
[28:22] the death of the high priest which is
[28:24] the ending of Jesus Christ's
[28:26] intercession then we rapture so that's
[28:29] what it said because he had to stay in
[28:30] that City of Refuge until that death of
[28:32] the high priest and then he could be
[28:34] restored he could go back to his City
[28:36] and they couldn't touch him he was free
[28:38] right which is the same thing as us we
[28:40] are under the shed blood of Jesus Christ
[28:42] here until we Rapture and then we're
[28:44] free everything goes back to way it was
[28:47] in God's mind right so that's why was
[28:50] the death of the high priest because
[28:51] it's the end of them cuz you got to
[28:52] remember too in the Bible even when
[28:54] Jesus had to leave and went to Egypt
[28:57] they waited you know the angel come back
[28:59] and told Joseph said that Herod is dead
[29:03] so in other words the law of
[29:05] Herod and it's just like us coming up to
[29:07] a new election of a president you know
[29:09] Trump's going to veto everything that
[29:12] that Obama did so you know you're going
[29:14] to you just you and it's a different
[29:15] thought process it's still all rotten
[29:18] and junk but it is when you bring
[29:20] another Administration in there are
[29:21] things that you disallow or say well
[29:25] that's done well see when Herod died
[29:27] what was it if you were
[29:28] a baby 2 years old and younger you were
[29:30] killed well the Jesus went to Egypt with
[29:34] Mary and Joseph and then the Lord told
[29:35] the angel told him said okay you can
[29:37] come back now why that law was gone it
[29:40] died with Herod mhm and then they could
[29:42] come back so that was good with the high
[29:44] priest which I knew that had to be some
[29:46] kind of example with Jesus Christ cuz he
[29:48] is the high priest of our confession you
[29:50] know so but thank God for that but U
[29:53] anything else but that's what we're
[29:55] going to do the next the next 12 months
[29:58] if we're not here 12 months
[30:01] sorry don't be sorry you want me to take
[30:04] next H so next Sunday you want no a I
[30:09] want you to sing every Sunday once a
[30:11] month I know that no it's once a month
[30:13] the month he's done he's already done
[30:15] yeah once a month he's already done help
[30:17] me out he's
[30:18] done so I appreciate all these guys you
[30:21] know I do and they're good support but
[30:22] you need to hear them you need to hear
[30:25] some if you know even the same one um
[30:28] even if everything is good um you like
[30:31] to hear somebody else something
[30:33] different you do yeah you do get into a
[30:35] cog and I see some of you sit there and
[30:37] you fall asleep so I don't do a whole
[30:39] lot of good to a lot of you so but
[30:42] um maybe somebody like brother Joe or
[30:45] somebody will jog your memory and you'll
[30:46] stay awake for a little while so Lord
[30:48] bless you get out of here
