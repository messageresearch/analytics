salvation your healing uh things like that you know and you know I thought the thought come to me is what I need more than anything is an increase in my faith and then I told Brother Ray about it and he sent me a email back and that's Luke 17 5 I believe it is but that's what they were praying for was an increase to be fair the other day you're watching uh the thing up in The Minister's meeting and Wade had something to say about it uh you know that the times and all of that you know and not this really doesn't mean a whole lot but to understand it will increase your faith that's what he said that's right you know and I found I believe sure what we need is an increase right in our faith Lord just be with her touch her you don't know we don't know what the situation is right but let's

welcomed a second time because we like yeah we're just part of the body of Christ amen so just make yourself to home and you know pray that the Lord with bless you amen amen you'd like turning your scriptures turn to Luke 11 we're not going to be on the seals tonight we're coming I'm going to inject the message into and if I get through I'll inject one if I don't I'll inject two but uh you know we'll try to do that it's just something as a matter of fact brother colleague read the scriptures and I I had them all underlined our Sunday when he was reading the responsive reading and I said well I've been intended to preach on that for a long time and I uh he just read part of the scripture there and we'll get to that in a little while but we'll try to carry on with that amen now remember the announcements now we've we've had so much problem with trying to get a Christmas time operating in the correct order of the dates and the times for everybody to where we can have our dinner together so what I thought we'd do this time if you want to is we'll just not have a Thanksgiving dinner and we'll move the Christmas dinner back like one Sunday I think it'd be this in December the 9th because we figured we couldn't do it on the first but be December of the 9th I believe is correct and we will be having on that Sunday our Thanksgiving dinner and Christmas dinner together right because that'll get cut down a little bit on on the sisters of fixing and doing but just remember that and we'll keep announcing that until the time in order where we can remember Terence has made all the other announcements she'll remember each and every one of them let's pray together Luke 11 49 and we'll also go with First Corinthians 2 1 through 8. Heavenly Father we thank you for you loving your grace our kindness and to us thank you for grace and Calvary and peace and joy and thank you for everything Lord and we ask you now that you would just come on the scene tonight to speak to our hearts and our lives that we may be what you want us to be we can read your word but it takes you to unfold it to where we can have understanding that's what we pray for more than anything in the world it's for you to move on the scene in our hearts and our lives forgive our sins cleanse us of all unrighteousness and keep us in your love blessing God each one you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we believe you and we expect you to do that Lord have your way now in Jesus name amen and we'll go to Luke 11 49 first then we'll go over to First Corinthians 2. he's talking about the the lawyers was arguing with him backwards and forth and he said you're you're blind you know you build a Supple to church and things like that and your father's killed him and I want to use verse 39 just as a point for that verse 49. therefore also said the wisdom of God no that's very odd reading yeah we're going to find out that wisdom can speak um therefore also said the wisdom of God I will send them prophets and apostles and some of them they shall slay and persecute all right so remember that now because that's what'll be the time of the message wisdom of God all right verse 2 of SEC First Corinthians 2. and we'll go one through eight and I Brethren when I came to you came not with Excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God see not with his brain not with intelligence right right for I determined not to know anything among you say Jesus Christ and him crucified I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom right but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God albeit we speak wisdom now what he's telling you the wisdom when man is no good so now he's changing something else right right albeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect well ain't nobody perfect what the Bible says you are so forget it yet not the wisdom of this world nor the princes of this world that come to knock but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom and watch it which God hath which God ordained before the world unto our Glory you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the re of the word and we're going to be talking about the wisdom of God and it says here in Luke it says wisdom speaks and says I'll send you prophets I sent you this I sent you that you killed him in other words you've crucified them you know so wisdom can speak that's right it's not you're speaking being of and I'll get this point in right up front it's not speaking then just of of an intelligence it's not speaking of a man's Wisdom and you might find out at the end a little more about wisdom when it comes to the point of finding out that wisdom has always been the wisdom I'm talking about amen but I'm not talking about man's brains and human intelligence or or any form I'm talking about Holy Ghost wisdom right amen or the wisdom of gods right now keep that in your mind all right so we see then that Luke says wisdom can speak and in Corinthians we read that we must speak right because Paul said I I speak wisdom I speak wisdom to them that are perfect I bet we see we speak wisdom among them that are perfect not the wisdom of this world or nor the princes of this world that come to know but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery so now the wisdom of God then is a mystery amen he said well let's just Holy Ghost well I think brother Gary one time was telling me about something that he said something the Lord spoke and said when just not the Holy Ghost you know yeah so we just want to make it some kind of a form of speaking and doing but we're going to talk about the wisdom of God and how that it can speak how they can talk so it's more than just the thoughts of man's mind and you'll see when we get to the end of the message that is even more than um a revelation from God and he said wait just a minute now well hold on to the end we'll get to it and we'll see if that's right or not all right but we'll think on that not Holy Ghost not man's Wisdom we were talking about the very wisdom of God the very intelligence of God Amen that causes this Holy Ghost knowledge that we have or Holy Ghost wisdom then that means it's of God right it's not of you and I amen amen it's of God see that way then we can uh put her confidence in amen and find out that there's a lot more to just thinking of well that's just Holy Ghost wisdom but uh in the pyramid that's knowledge you know but wait a minute do we read a few things about it but think on these things now wisdom can speak in our confession must be according to what he says because that's he makes intercession Upon Our confession right right profession confession all right so it's got to be what he says yep that it's been given to us and then if it's God's wisdom it must not only become an intelligence to us you know our brains in Reading studying it must become a very part of us amen so then you know we can we can deal with those things I really enjoyed brother Aaron's message there Sunday uh when he first started off I'd wondered which way it was going and you know I was kidding him about it I said well you've done good I said you didn't even make one Rabbit Trail yeah you know you generally goes for a while and then he goes off and then he has to back up and start again but I thought he'd done an excellent job of what he was trying to express to us you know and uh you know I had no stops as a matter of fact I have them if you want to look at it laying on my desk I had written down before he started speaking some things to speak about and then when he came out I said well okay we'll just let him say it people don't want to leave me anymore let him say it maybe they'll hear her in the second opinion you know it ain't an opinion in the Holy Ghost but I really enjoyed it because I'm like deer smokes we talk about former letter Reign we talk about uh you know what is here and what's not here you cannot have the latter rain unless the former rain is sold that's correct amen what is the need of it see now your your Pentecostal people they have what they call ladder rain but it's it is the how pouring of the spirit right right now you're going to argue of the prophet and the Bible or with them it is the outpouring of the spirit Cody said I part my spirit on All Flesh all right but yet the problem they have is what the word right right that's it they have just enough of it to make it work yep that's quoting the prophet just enough of it to to make it go and do and the healing comes the signs and the Wonders comes and all like that right and to look at other churches about the country and seeing denominational churches and you would find probably more uh signs and wonders a lot of times better than you find here are among the Believers of the message because that's what they deal with right they're only working according to that manifestation all right but you're going to ask them about the faith of the fathers yes we have it look at the signs and wonders what is their basis right we have here among us today what is in the book of Acts we have the the signs and wonders taking place all right but without the word amen being there how can you judge it or determine anything about it right Lee then without a character within us built by the word then what we have is not worth anything right right even though we can have the great signs and wonders and the great thing can happen and you can say well they have more signs and wonders than the Believers of the master time argue with me I'm on a great week all right sure but the basis is they don't have the word right amen right you see you ever think about how to work because look what none you didn't listen to what I said you need to quote run around and said they take so much of the word and make it work all right now until then there's there's got to be something that you know has to be in you and I in this end time and that's what I believe Aaron was getting at it because that's what I was following along I believe in signs and wonders I want to see God Among Us more than ever before right amen I cry out every day never service before I come out here I ask him to use me and my friend want to go you know Lord this this that scripture that I quoted you know he sent his word among us to heal the sick man and I believe it's delivered amen I believe it's delivered a lot of people amen I believe it's here to uh uh anything that we have need of right we've seen things happen we've seen the dead raised the sick heal right we've seen great things happen Among Us just in this little group right all right and by doing that we haven't put our bases upon trying to make it work that's it yeah we put our faces upon trying to get an understanding of the scriptures right by the Holy Spirit not by man's Wisdom as we were reading because man's Wisdom was doing good you can quote the Bible from Genesis to Revelation you had a photographic memory you could just go through it and look at that but that still doesn't mean a thing to you dead and lost as long as you ain't Born Again amen you're sold as black as son if you're not born again even though you could quote Everything Jesus never said right amen and even if you'd walk there with him washed his clothes and and feed him every meal and everything you could have done yeah see and all sounds and wonders could be following you right if the word's not present first then those signs and wonders I'm not saying there are of no value that would be foolish right right because to see anyone delivered any sick healed if the pope wrong lay his hands on somebody and they was raised from the dead I would shout Glory Hallelujah right right I wouldn't agree with this Doctrine but I shout about that God raised the dead because he ain't nobody can heal or deliver or anything but God himself but I see the what I see is wrong with the little church what's out there if anybody listening that's your business what I see is wrong with this church is is we don't put our confidence in what God has given us right amen I didn't say build up the preacher all right okay I've had twice here these people tried to bring me up to try to say that I was a prophet both times I've come to this pulpit and flatly denied that to say no I am not a prophet I do not operate like a prophecy I'm just what I am I talking about honoring me I'm talking about believing what God has said to you and I uh right no matter who it's come from or what it's come from me but to honor that word and give honor and Grace unto it you know give a give praise unto him and say thank you Lord for what you've done moment because that way see that we don't have to worry about getting exalted right you know because an exalted Spirit see won't work that's right other gift may work but it's going to come to its Folly amen but I see that that's what's wrong with you and I if we don't put our confidence right into where we're at I don't mind saying it this way do anybody out there that's listening if you got more signs and wonders than one we can come here and produce the people that were healed and everything even the dead was raised right if you got more than that well praise God all right thank God for him right but what about the word well we don't need that word now we we we're we're in the the we're in the third pool but I thought the third quarter opening the worst right right I didn't know it was anything else all right I thought that's what the prophet said yes but you just put two emphasis of one word word word word word I know to put on is John 1 1. that's right in the beginning was the word word with God the Word was God Amen and verse 14 said and the Word was made flesh and dwell Among Us that's right but see we're not looking at it we're we're I'm talking here and hang out Gardner all right what I see wrong with this church is there's too many people in here that think they know all about what's going on now Shake Yourself clear it up and get an understanding the Holy Ghost is the only one that knows what's going on but you see what people are thinking if it was me up there it would work yeah um I'm not exalted not married I'm truthful come on man women and all one because I want to see God move amen right amen but you know what our trouble is when we start getting those exalted Spirits right the Earth what's killing the spirit of God let's bind them together in one thing because that's what I prayed told you I'm praying for a Revival a Revival not of gifts and signs and wonders but a Revival of Love among a group of people that would surpass all things when your Prophet said one day he said I'd rather see the love among the people than see 5 000 people healed amen I mean I listen I I was in shock but he finished the statement he said because we have love Among Us they'd be ten thousand people healed right man so then he was around would you see our problem is if we don't put the emphasis upon the revealed word now according to my understanding I'll get off this in a second I'm just saying something about what Aaron was was trying to say like one brother though one time I asked the Brother David said did you say that that he said I said no I didn't say that so Aaron he can get his next time he can get up there and say I didn't say that no that'd be all right but I just want a brother said I said no I didn't say that right you know but listen if we don't confess what is Among Us right how can God come Among Us that's right now but you see now everybody puts emphasis up on the the book of Acts the faith of the fathers but to my understanding now if I'm wrong I'm up for correction but make sure you come good with it because I want to know this because I've been studying this for 40 something years faith of the fathers means revelation of the father right right it doesn't mean signs and wonders amen minds and wonders followers revelation of the father you first got to get the revelation of the fathers that's why it's called Faith revelation of the fathers all right that's what people look at they say well we don't see nothing going on well you're blind amen that's right I'm sorry you're blind amen and blindness is what's causing us it's killing us I told you brother asked me that I I believe we was at the faith of the fathers and I'm fatically stated yes I'm going to go stronger tonight everybody listening I believe the headstone's here all right come on come on Amen for those who can receive it amen amen amen yeah but I don't see the signs anyone see you're after signs and wonders right you know what after the words and signs and wonders following the word John's followers them that believe Believers don't follow signs that was brother Harris's favorite saying wouldn't it I 100 agree with it but signs will follow Believers right if we don't confess The Headstone in here it can't come right right is it going to come in some secret way what's it going to be so let's start confessing amen but you see what we do is we talk about what the doctor says and we all go to the doctors well do you ever hear me in the Pulpit okay I come here dying and hurting all over and I'll never tell you I'll never tell my wife how much I hurt why because it'll hinder her it'll hinder her right it won't hip her that's what she said value doing I said doing fine because that's what our confession is supposed to be I thought our confession of healings was dangerous the same as bases that are confession of salvation are you saved today in locks tomorrow say well I'm feeling good but I'm without it my brother Eric on my downlies you don't know I love that because down in The Valleys is where everything grows good that's right yeah you get up on the mountain sure you're going up on a mountain called flood put the soil up there you work flattens off and things you got valleys but you get up on the mountains I've been up there where the trees wouldn't but yeah this hour in the window garage all right that was just in Colorado but listen Church I think it's time to start saying what we are and what we believe we are and where we stand that's right do you think I'm afraid of anybody out there coming and said will it comfortable come on bring the word right and then if you want the signs and wonders to back it up calculate I know I'm aggravated and hurting calculate your church to see how many people have been healed and the Dead's been raised in the city and bring them and let's lay them down side to side right right so you shouldn't be that way why not I'm just sick and tired of Satan pushing you and me around because of our little petty feelings right yeah all right come on because that won't be one thing of our wisdom we're talking about okay that's right I think that's what Aaron was talking about if it wasn't even Straighten It Up I just want to see us folks move on right now it's just like I said over and over you don't pray for rain in a monsoon season huh that's right we don't need a manifested son of God or a daughter of God when it's raining like crazy To Pray For Rain right you might want one to pray for it to stop yeah but if there's no sick among us how can God manifest itself um all right sure well if we had what we think we have well go show me somewhere else that's got anything all right amen you know what I'm saying I've tried to explain it of course everybody thinks I'm trying to justify you take the people in the book of Acts and you put them right down here today right and let's see what they produce I don't mind talking that away I don't think God is mad at me for that right because you take some time and you calculate how many healings is in the book of Acts I challenge you on this point sit down sometime and read the book of Acts and write down every healing that took place and then come and let's sit down talk about how many has happened here that's right no wonder brother Randall said he said I've seen more miracles right in one service right he said then there's even all of the Ministry of Jesus right yep now did he have any problems saying that but you see all of that goes into wisdom girl that's what I want us to get to because there's a wisdom that is so close the Holy Ghost wisdom right until the Earth where our problem is that's correct amen now if you don't catch that out of the message you you just go ahead and listen to it over and over there is a wisdom that comes in there so close yep that's right until there's only one thing above it and that's holy ghost from revelation or wisdom right and wisdom according to the Bible I'll go ahead and say it and then I'll prove it wisdom according to the Bible is a person that's right I'm done by Holy Ghost wisdom right right amen not the wisdom of man all right it's a person Reverend said if you read the Bible and don't see Christ in every verse what'd he say all right he said go back and read it again because you missed it right that's right wisdom is a person wisdom is just as old as God is that's right because he was with God when he created all kinds of that ring a bell John 1 1 again Amen in the beginning was the word word with God the Word was God is that enough to open your eyes and then we'll go back and prove it and read the scripture and see what it is Holy Ghost wisdom not man's Wisdom right amen amen okay go ahead now let's see I'm gonna check out and see where I start at you know my book number one brother we'll get started so we're gonna have a lot of scripture tonight we don't go through the scripture we're just going to go one to the other one or the other in the scripture all right now going down to uh then to Ephesians 3. go on to the next one there you go now look what Paul says about wisdom to make all men is what he wanted to do to see what is the Fellowship of the mystery I remember what we read yep in Corinthians the mystery of wisdom right wisdom is a mystery so now look what Paul's saying The Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world have been hidden God who created All Things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now unto the pitch of power peace and Powers in Heavenly places might be might be known by the church the what now the manifold wisdom of God we're in the end time folks we're supposed to be the end of all things right we're supposed to be winding it off and we're supposed to be having some form of understanding in this day of all powers and heavens and everything that principle anything to make known to a bride of Jesus Christ the manifold wisdom of God not man's Wisdom second Corinthians 3 and this is not on that one I just read it brother you know I got a lot down to quote II Corinthians 3 19 to First Corinthians 3 19 says the wisdom of this world is foolishness right with God so we're certainly not talking about wisdom of man how much intelligence we can receive how much we can know of the message that's it amen I heard the Bible see First Corinthians 1 22 says the Jews require a sign the Greeks seek wisdom right all right Greek seek after wisdom Proverbs 2 and 6 says for the lord giveth wisdom out of his mouth come at knowledge and understanding amen amen I want you to notice that because we're going to get out in a minute and you'll see what I'm talking about it God didn't say nutless God didn't say the lord giveth knowledge and understanding we know he does but get the point where the lord giveth wisdom then he says out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding which one do you want you want knowledge understanding or wisdom that's right look how important God considers wisdom to be who had number three brother First Corinthians 12 8. Market 1 is given to Spirit given by the spirit right the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit and which comes first which do you want you want knowledge you want understanding as we quoted from proverbs or do you want wisdom first right number four take them from the message God keeps his word 1957 four or seven in the morning service look at here the first gift and allowed gifts is wisdom that's right absolutely amen the second is knowledge y'all watch it and if you don't have any wisdom how do you know what to do with knowledge right amen amen amen come on seek the best things first is that what the scripture is interested in wisdom and if you hadn't got wisdom what can you do with knowledge right I'm speaking with Jones right are these other things it takes wisdom it takes God's wisdom Solomon said call it your mother now I searched for an hour this morning I never did find out what are you leaning on me I couldn't find it so if you do let me know you're right but what did they do the Pentecostal received speaking in tongues and they made a denomination out of it and they wanted this sure they did and a mixed multitude went with them so what did they get first what comes first to mankind right that's what he wants his knowledge which is most not supposed to be first right nope wisdom is supposed to be first amen all right now remember that as we go through and don't forget it place I don't say it about five times the prophet says what would you do with your knowledge right if you don't have any wisdom all right right oh I just want to understand just tell me about nothing I've told you before God's told me a lot of things I could do and give me the opportunity to do what I wanted to and I ain't done it yet one of them is quitting maybe yeah but it's all right but you see we want knowledge we want understanding have you ever heard a preacher get up and say now what I'm going to tell you today I don't believe is the Lord never heard that no they always say the Lord told me Lord told me to come tell you is it the Lord so wisdom must come first right right now I hope you'll start getting the idea of what I said wisdom is a person right understanding and knowledge comes from that person all right wisdom was with God before the world right amen amen understanding and knowledge comes to human terminologies upon Earth in you and I right we must have understanding we must have knowledge come on yeah that's right but it must be first what right now according to my Bible and the prophet I fall after I've changed today to testify to the chiropractor you just said something we got to talking about tapes and things and he said what dates you listen to oh that opened it up I hope it was listed I sure don't want it just be knowledge because he can run people off on that but I've done the best I could do in about a five minute run through and I left office by saying you know according to the Bible Malachi 4. the money's got to turn the hearts of the children back to the face of the Fathers as if they don't it won't be no Rapture right and I said Rapture is not an automatic processor right right not just because of bus pools that's right you're right I said Rapture is a revelation right yep yes sir he's not stupid I hope it was wisdom but now think about it what good is your gift did the prophet say that did he say the gifts without the virtues is what they didn't say they was wrong and bad and we didn't need them did he come on what did he say he said the gifts without the virtues is a stumbling block that's right that's right yep not against guilts he wanted gifts but it becomes a stumbling block because you allow those gifts to get in your way right that's right yeah brother was up one nothing Church went out years ago and he was talking like you know that he had discernment when he finished I went up shook his hand I said brother I said enjoyed your message only one point I want to make if you discern me out with something just keep Discerning until you find out what's behind it I said because it's God behind it all in between there to be taken care of all right so if you discern me out to find me a bad egg you know there's a sister in India you know old man just run it on back till I see you see what I'm talking about amen and then that way you know you'll get rid of all of that in between but now look if you don't have wisdom how do you know what to do with your knowledge all right said on number five look what he said these are the only quotes I'm giving to the prophet and I've got one more student name Mayra 67 a name of 70 week the 70th week of Daniel Daniel the spirit of wisdom comes into the church I notice the inside the spirit of knowledge or understand it in Daniel what does it say Daniel I've come to give you understanding all right but watch him here now the spirit of wisdom comes into the church to make known to the church by the revelation of the Holy Ghost bringing the church in and revealing what day that we're living in just the same as Gabriel come to to Daniel all right the Holy Spirit comes to the church in the last days to reveal these great deep secret things do you understand but we don't need things I told him in the Bible study the other night people think Daniel said you wish is confusing yeah give me about an hour we just talk about what the prophet said about the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the new birth and if you don't housing you birth you'll come out of there confused it's all you know that's right I'm trying everything is confusing until it's revealed right amen I don't care what it is or how simple it is man probably said you don't need a revelation to realize what a baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I agree amen true but you need understanding to be able to read now come on then the Holy Ghost comes to the church to make known to the church by the revelation of Jesus Christ bringing us to the place but in wisdom welcome man not just his knowledge knowledge perfect right right is that scripture amen all right now we're going to take a lot of scripture go ahead with number six you see automatically just the second chronicles 1 12 8-12 it just disappeared Miss back all right you see that it's Solomon now everybody knows the story of Solomon right what was the thing Solomon desired understanding and knowledge no no you knew a little more about that than we think he did understanding and knowledge would be great of how to rule I mean how to do and fight a war and look what he says amen give me now wisdom and knowledge amen wisdom first what did I may go out and come in before this people well who can judge this thy people that is so great that's right and God said to Solomon because this was in thine heart and thou has asked not riches wealth or honor nor the life of thine enemies neither yet has asked long life laughs but if that's wisdom yeah and knowledge but I say off but I must judge my people over whom I have made the king now watch what God Said Amen thank you what did God say wisdom and knowledge he didn't say knowledge amen wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee and I will give thee riches and wealth and honor such as none of the Kings I've had that have been before thee neither shall bear any after they have the life amen my seeking wisdom that should be writing any man's heart that if he's serving God to want knowledge and understanding of how to do things I mean I'm a bachelor of church I I want understanding and knowledge from God how to do things that's right you know what to do in case of this that or the other what you see are we seeking wisdom are we seeking understanding and knowledge which we are because see there's knowledge of the Lord the Bible called the dead knowledge of the Lord right but wisdom and knowledge was granted under Solomon do you remember that there was a little Queen came to see Solomon right she came for about three months just to get over there to see because you'd heard about all of the great things that was taking place and how that God was with Israel through Solomon you know the Bible says that not one thing was withholding that's right from her that she desired to understand was that knowledge with that understanding oh yeah okay you you want to know how to run your kingdom you go out here and you take so many men you put them over here that's all knowledge she saw the wisdom that could only come from God wisdom she knew Solomon couldn't tell her her thoughts nothing was withholding from go look up how many times right around emphasizes that see he showed her the very secrets of her heart yep she knew that God was with him because she sat down right there with a man yep Solomon want understanding and knowledge how to rule no he said Lord give me wisdom in other words Lord come down and live and live amen right was that what he wanted amen right come down and be so present until and it was amazing to remember when the the two women that one of the babies the women too had two babies remembering one of the babies that died and and the the they got into an argument about who did it belong to and I said okay we'll go to Solomon and the wisdom of Solomon what did he do they both said yeah that's mine that's mine Solomon said let's solve the problem we'll just give each one of you half of it you get the sword we'll divide it the real mother screamed out no don't kill my child I'll give it to her he said you're the mother taking another one out of here we've done anybody to lead his people you have many men that were of great knowledge but he wanted wisdom right what do we want right I've had people to say to me say brother Dave I'd love to have the knowledge you have as a message well you know what if you'd have stayed out of Walmart this is a good old saying here in America overseas in case you don't understand that just simply means you're passion you foolish time away down at Walmart shopping it's all over the country now getting in your countries so you'll find out what it is to go to Walmart you can find anything you want yeah see I dedicated my life when I come into the message to try to have understanding right you listening right I wanted knowledge I was trained how to use my knowledge to crack you with words but then one day I saw I didn't need knowledge understanding right I needed wisdom all right and you know what I saw it after until I found it amen all right sure because I found the person right go to number seven we're gonna get on number nine we're just gonna read a whole new chapter all right look what it says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge and watch but fools despise wisdom and instruction yep amen Why didn't it say there that fools decide despise knowledge because it wouldn't be correct everybody wants knowledge right we're building knowledge right yep you want to walk home tonight no now they put you in automobile where you can get it and drive home right right the world is built on knowledge that's why the world hates wisdom I get it right you said but wisdom is this knowledge well why did the fool hate it then but that's all he's built on this knowledge you build on understanding now they can blow the world apart and eat any given time never been before right because of their knowledge but they hate wisdom I hate you see where I've got a couple of year on the quote I'm fine Ecclesiastes 9 and 16. now this is a quotient all right says wisdom is better than strength sure I believe in that story if not in there I'm interested in there one or two you remember where the man came up the young young guy did and told him how they could win the war you remember that in the Bible if it's not that right it's just somewhere and he told them how to win the war you know what they won the war but they forgot who gave them the understanding instead of getting praised for the the ACT they were just praising each other Ecclesiastes 9 and 18 says wisdom is better than weapons of war I remember a town in the Bible when they built a city that you could run chariot races on the top of that concrete built or whatever you want to call it in that day building that was around you know the wall but chariot races I mean if you had one horse and a buggy one horse and a bug he would cover at least five or seven feet and they didn't exactly have horses and Buggies you know but if you put two buggies around running around you'd have to have 15 feet or more bad chariot races around the wall on the taco mm-hmm hours I mean how would you know Joshua going to get in there all right the gates was iron and you know right tons of times and couldn't break through wow all right he didn't pray for understanding of how to defeat the army God just dropped down and said this is the way you do it walk around there one time he studied come on back and settle down just worry them a little bit you know make them all upset do you know day one and went around and that's all the person are they gonna try to come up now well yeah I don't know I'm kind of a little afraid well day two day three day four and then it's up on the top of the rock Sam the wisdomen yep told him to go around it seven times that last day turn around and face the wall and they blow the trumpet and everybody shouted and the wall went straight not crumbled Earth just opened up right make you just see that guy on the inside boy I think let me go fight him let me ask our fighting Israelites and about that time the wall goes and he's standing there that's it I'm on your side all right let's go all right you being silly I'm just being truthful you see wisdom told them how to go down you get all the stories in the Bible so you could go from one to one to one to one we'll stay all night but I want to get down in these scriptures all right look at the next one Ephesians 1 number eight Ephesians 1 16 17 18. so he's not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom amen now there it is again so remember it give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him now you went along with the others well no let's see if you go along with that one he went along that wisdom goes before knowledge and that was always the number one gift was wisdom and then the neck was knowledge now how about you going along that you gonna follow that scripture may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation now according to my Bible in the prophet that I follow no man can call Jesus a Christ except what by the Holy Ghost by the new birth not by letters from your mouth right amen see we're getting a little deeper to wisdom is going to come even before revelation my brother or understand Uncle Revelation okay wow that the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance of the Saints you can only know that by the baptism of the Holy Ghost yep right now let's go over where brother collie was Sunday proverbs eight and we have a lot of scripture to read 36. now watch this when you're reading through this scripture it'll say she he they I don't remember we being in there but I'm sure it probably is and you're gonna find out if this wisdom was before the world all right all right sure you got a Scofield bible turn down to the bottom of the page there and see that even Scofield I don't agree with his statements but yet still he knew by looking at it from an intellectual point that that wisdom had to be greater than even he said than a personification I don't agree with Eric I believe it is he said it was the Eternal Son of God right sure but we look at it as wisdom you ever read the Bible like that and look at something you know you're reading down through there they're not with some crying understanding go for it she stands in the top of the high places right away you know right keep Crossing it again you know what you're talking about who's he talking about what's he talking about you're just reading words come on what you talking about does not wisdom cry and understanding put forth her voice there you are again wisdom first the wisdom can cry wisdom wisdom each one wisdom wisdom wisdom now I hope I don't have to point at one of them if I ask you I'd go down through my Bible right on every verse 1-36 wisdom wisdom wisdom wisdom wisdom wisdom wisdom wisdom wisdom wisdom you finally realize what's taking place she who wisdom you know take me feminished I talked somewhere keep standing in the top of the high places by the way in the places of the past each verse like a preachers all right an hour off the verse it said she cried at the gates at the entry of the city after coming in at the door unto you oh man I call what wisdom and my voice is to the sons of man only simple you know what you just can only be simple you can't be anything else and understand I want you simple understand wisdom any food be you an understanding heart wisdom says here for I will speak of excellent things and the opening my lips shall be right things for my mouth shall speak truth amen amen and wickedness is an Abomination to my lips wisdom from my mouth shall speak truth and wisdom in his Abomination to my lives all the words the words of my mouth are in righteousness now wouldn't that be something to think that everything you say is righteousness you see why we almost take a midnight foreign wouldn't it be something to think everything you say is right wouldn't it be something ever thought you had was right come on right all the work in my mouth are in righteousness there is nothing forward our perverse in them amen the present tense I am that I am They're all playing to him that understandeth oh but I can't understand them seals not down in 70 weeks you know why he ain't got a revelation amen amen right that's what the Bible said amen it says they're playing wisdom is playing to him that understand it and write to them that find knowledge wisdom is going to lead you tonight now watch what he says watch what wisdom said receive my instructions and not silver and knowledge rather than Choice gold for wisdom is better than rubies and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it isn't that wonderful playing that song about the gold the silver the diamonds look what he says eye wisdom now you don't have no problem with our understanding who they're talking about do you right I wisdom dwell with a prudence and find out knowledge of it witty inventions but he knows what called her all them things goes wrong and all that stuff you know and like brother Jeffries was saying one time I remember him talking about it he said I'd had trouble working on a tractor or something he said I'm sitting there in a few and said you was preaching away and said all at once here it comes it went home fixed it right he even got into that with him listen the fear of the Lord is to hate evil Pride inheritance right the fear of the Lord is to hate evil we stop there private arrogance and the evil way and the forward mouth do I hate amen listen counsel is mine and sound wisdom I am understanding I have strength I'm talking about wisdom right come on we're still talking about wisdom by me King's reign and Prince's decree Justice David Solomon Etc yep by me Prince's Rule and even all the judges of the Earth look at him wisdom says I love thee on that love me and those that seek me early shall find me yeah I hope you understanding what I'm saying wisdom is a person whistle is a being amen we're talking about God not man's Wisdom Holy Ghost wisdom I love them that love me those that seek me early she'll find me it's not hard to find wisdom right you just get the baptism when the Holy Ghost right Richard and honor are with me yay durable riches and righteousness my fruit is better than gold gay than fine gold we sing that song you know and my Revenue then Choice silver damn it look wisdom see in the way of righteous righteousness that I may cause those that love me to inherit substance amen did Solomon get substance right Riches of all the kings man because he wanted wisdom to lead the people and I will feel their Treasures I don't care about all that stuff when he had a problem when they had us don't caring about it you say you just give it all away I tried to a lot of times you know help do but where are we at the Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old now sure ain't no head knowledge isn't it that's right I thought we believe John 1 1 said in the beginning was the word the rift God in the Word was God and didn't believe that was a trinity right we didn't believe it was God With God you know in the beginning was the word translated like the prophet of God did in the beginning was Elohim Elohim was with Elohim and Elohim was Elohim that's the way he does it on the I'm getting a minute not the Mighty God the Lord possessed me in the beginning of his ways that's you get in there and you'll find hours where Schofield says this is not yes just out he says it's greater than even a personification yeah I don't understand all these thoughts but I don't know what he finally winds up saying thank you all right but is a distinct abdibration a d-u-m-b-r-a-t-i-o-n abdibration of Christ which means a overshadowing or means a representation yep a representation of Christ all right so if you don't see Christ in every verse read it again Christ is this wisdom I'm talking about that's right this person I'm talking about amen the Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his work to move I was set up from Everlasting from the beginning or ever the Earth was with our no depths I was brought forth amen when there were no foundations of bounding with water she performed before the mountains were settled before the hills was I brought forth as long as yet he had not made the Earth not to see yours not the highest part of the Dust of the world he's already there amen wisdom was already there amen amen when he prepared the heavens I was there the prophet said what out from God went alone gosh speech and began to say Let There Be he said not another God said but God in another form called a word are you listening when he prepared the heavens I was there when he said accomplish upon the face of the Dead you know to keep the all the different things happen when he established the clouds above when he strengthened the strengthened The Fountains of the deep when he gave to the Sea his decree that the water should not pass his commandment when he appointed the foundations of the Earth amen then I always by him as one brought up with him and I was daily his Delight amen rejoicing always before him little brother said when that went out to create how great could a seventh grade education man explain but he explained it with a man that had wisdom the theologians couldn't figure it out that's right he set out from God towards a Halo and they couldn't argue from that because they knew that right you theologians get your Bible Scofield and then says the first thing that went out from God was the word of God which was the son of God those theologians knew that but then they turned it into a trinity listen then I was by him as one brought it with him and I was David here Delight rejoicing always before him rejoicing in the Hospital part of his Earth amen and my Delights were with the sons of me amen now therefore hearken unto me all you children for blessed are they that keep my ways and ways of wisdom your instructions and be wise and refuse it not blessed is a man that Hearth me watching daily at my Gates waiting at the post of my daughters but whosoever findeth me kind of life and show obtain favor oh Lord amen but he that Sinners against me wrong with his own soul all day that hate me love death amen I could have put that right into Fort Seal from where we ended up if I don't want it to but I chose not to he chose to just take the scriptures and let's talk about wisdom let's not talk about knowledge and understanding let's talk about wisdom let's get wisdom the baptism of the Holy Ghost the New Birth the person of God himself living inside of us in the new birth that was with God before the world that was God himself I still haven't preached all I know know that God revealed me about himself I'm just waiting I've got something you don't worry about it I've told you that before it didn't come out and preach on me because see I can look back there and it's just plain as language and see that that one that went out from God couldn't become the Son of God Amen not God the son right no such thing in the Bible amen right right that's why I don't get caught with all these two Souls Two Lords River Jordans and stuff that Jesus wouldn't god Till The River Jordan when my Bible said he was born to Emmanuel that's why I don't get caught with all that stuff why because I'm looking at the author I'm reading his word just like reading that in Psalms marking it that's where I've read my brother call me soon all that underlined to preach also one of these days didn't even have to write a note for this message but see wisdom as a person amen amen it's just not understanding you get a revelation of a person in that Revelation and you can become one now you've got wisdom you don't just have a revelation you've got wisdom you're following me when that Revelation becomes personal not just a healing Revelation not just some way or some part Revelation but complete perfect revelation turned out to be wisdom you see that's why I can say I believe the headstones here right amen I believe the word has been planted in the field that now the rain can fall and I see no promise in this last days contrary to most everybody in the message that's looking at it I see no promise except the one thing the prophet of God said when that door closes one day God will anoint a church and you'll see in one year what theologists is trying to do watch him but saying he's doing it now yeah that's right he's not failing he's not just playing around he's crying you and I to see if we want knowledge understanding or do we want wisdom do we want an understanding of a person or the person living within us right that's right which do we desire we want head knowledge for Holy Ghost knowledge all right holy ghost knowledge will never be contrary to the word amen that's what everybody's saying well brother Branham you know when we hear in any career now you're correcting yep you're saying he was wrong when he didn't say he was wrong if he says he's wrong he told us he is wrong that's right amen I'm done riddle I remember that statement years ago never forgot he said anybody will one-eyed and highest since I know you just put that down one night in half sentence what a no if this was a prophet nobody corrects a prophet God himself amen he stands before no man he stands before wisdom yep that's right which is the person of God Amen wisdom is a very part of God and you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your heart it's a part of God not God in a part I didn't say that it's part of God he's the only one that could divide himself among seven billion people in the world today and give everybody in the world a new birth and would have no less Holy Ghost than what he did when he started that's right because he's God wisdom might encourage you to read the Bible a little more plainer you know Michael Prophet saying wisdom was the first because what would you do with your knowledge if you didn't have wisdom you would destroy it instead of help wisdom is that new birth that one that talks to you and tells you and leads you that one that heals you and saves you Solomon knew what wisdom was we talk about David and those men like that I believe Solomon was speaking in the first person don't you Man David will say David said they pierced my hands enough to eat and Etc you know right we say oh he was speaking in the first person I thought all true Prophets spoke in the first person right that's right that's why they said thus saith the Lord they were not saying what they meant or thought they were saying what God Said right right their lips were turned over to God so he could speak ing about brother Branham listen to Brother Richard there today at home talking about the ceciling the things thinking about brother Branham on that sixth Hill he said we're not still open he said I just kind of walked down the room oops go back and find out what he's talking about yeah that's right he was talking about that those two prophets open that six seal one time he even said they were that six still that's right that's how close correct but he said they opened that Sixth Seal when they want to don't you think he was standing there looking I've done preached six of them by the wisdom of God you're standing here now trying to tell you the seventh one that is not even written in the word right man amen don't you think he would feel like that you wouldn't know it comes down you just want to run don't you yeah I preached the menial sermon you can believe this or not I preached to many a sermon and walked down from this there and the Sea and wonder who preached that night um you didn't like how he walked through it don't matter to me that's how real it is amen you realize you're standing here with sold in your hand all right if I don't lead you right you could make it right but I'm lost if I know better it won't lead you right yep that's right let's see wisdom seek after wisdom seek after God and he will bring you understanding and Revelation and knowledge if you get wisdom first come on brother just read that over and over and over there and look at it it was speaking and said I was with God how is that I really formed the world he was that's why we believe in one true and living God see that one God then you can stand and look and to see before the world and after the world and all around you just still got to work on it yeah but I thought it was a trinity that's where your denomination developed at in the Catholic Church did to confuse you to keep you from seeing the truth one of The Commandments I thought said something about it it was just one God beside him it was no other I thought that's what we used to all make that statement there was one thing God didn't know you know there's one thing I don't know you don't know no other gods right amen you don't exist to him right oh they're call gods but he said I don't know no other think about wisdom just seek wisdom seek the baptism of the Holy Ghost is what I'm trying to tell you when you receive that you get wither storm amen every mourned again believer did you listen ever born-again believer has a portion of it and the greater depths of the Statue of a perfect man brings more of that wisdom into our being right until the prophet said he was deliver of our being and take us into rapture amen what do you want knowledge or understanding I want wisdom because with that we'll come to knowledge and understanding that I haven't even understand foreign foreign foreign foreign thank you sweet you will Twin down Sunday morning our way to
