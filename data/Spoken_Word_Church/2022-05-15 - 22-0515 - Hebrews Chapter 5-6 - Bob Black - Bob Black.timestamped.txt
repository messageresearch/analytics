[0:00] because of that the closer he gets to
[0:01] the seventh chapter
[0:03] um so he's kind of
[0:04] trying to trying to set the stage for
[0:06] that in in chapter five and we we've got
[0:08] to set uh verse six here let's just go
[0:10] to the lord in prayer before we begin
[0:12] our study lord we just ask we're so
[0:14] grateful or to be able to gather around
[0:15] your word this morning and we just pray
[0:17] lord that you'll just be with brother
[0:18] wade as he's studying lord and bless the
[0:20] services today
[0:21] and bless our study now as we go through
[0:23] your word here and may it be profitable
[0:25] to us we pray in your name amen
[0:29] so verse 6 says as he saith also in
[0:31] another place thou art a priest forever
[0:33] after the order of melchizedek and you
[0:36] know you know when you study study
[0:38] things out
[0:39] paul start kind of bringing
[0:41] keto phrases out that relate to one
[0:43] another and and one of those is in verse
[0:45] 7 who in the days of his flesh so he's
[0:48] talking about melchizedek that talked to
[0:50] abraham and then he jumps over to talk
[0:51] about jesus christ
[0:53] uh who in the days of his flesh there
[0:56] you know praying in the garden of
[0:57] gethsemane i've got a little picture of
[0:59] jesus praying in the garden of
[1:00] gethsemane and and really you know think
[1:02] of his whole life that the suffering and
[1:05] and the things that he went through who
[1:07] in the days of his flesh when he had
[1:08] offered up prayers and supplications
[1:10] with strong crying and tears unto him
[1:12] that was able to save him from death and
[1:14] was heard and that he feared
[1:16] so of course now now paul is comparing
[1:19] christ to is a high priest not after the
[1:22] order of aaron a man that would just
[1:24] like us they could what could die and uh
[1:28] you know what
[1:30] like
[1:31] the differ the difference between the
[1:33] order of air and the new order of
[1:34] melchizedek is the order of melchizedek
[1:37] is god revealed in flesh
[1:40] so that's what the point he's trying to
[1:42] make in verse seven who in the days of
[1:44] his flesh in the days of his flesh
[1:46] that's that's that same god now that
[1:48] talked to abraham now he's uh packaged
[1:51] up bottled up in that in that flesh man
[1:53] that was crying out to god in the garden
[1:55] of gethsemane
[1:57] so
[1:59] paul's making a point that you know
[2:01] jesus learned obedience he he
[2:05] was made perfect by the things that he
[2:07] suffered and we also are going to have
[2:09] to
[2:10] be made perfect and he begins to talk
[2:12] about perfection and and and how we also
[2:15] are all going to suffer that god wants
[2:17] us to suffer because he's molding us and
[2:20] making us into the image of of a perfect
[2:22] man
[2:23] of christ jesus and so in the smyrna in
[2:25] church asian chapter four brother brahma
[2:26] said in plain language the very
[2:28] character of jesus was perfected by
[2:31] suffering and according to paul he has
[2:33] left his church a measure of suffering
[2:35] that they too by their faith in god
[2:37] while suffering for him would come to a
[2:38] place of perfection
[2:40] so that's what paul's speaking of when
[2:41] he says in verse eight though he were a
[2:43] son yet learned the obedience by the
[2:45] things which he suffered
[2:47] and being made perfect he became the
[2:50] author of eternal salvation unto all
[2:52] them that obey him
[2:54] so brother branham quotes james chapter
[2:56] one he says my brother encountered all
[2:57] joy when you fall into divers
[2:59] temptations
[3:00] knowing this that the trying of your
[3:02] faith worketh patience but let patience
[3:04] have her perfect work that you may be
[3:06] perfect and entire wanting nothing
[3:10] i see when you can begin to realize what
[3:12] your but god's want wants
[3:14] the desire for god in your life that he
[3:16] wants you to be to be perfect then it
[3:19] changes your outlook when you begin to
[3:20] realize that the things that you go
[3:22] through in life are are
[3:24] are for that end
[3:26] your for your perfection i was talking
[3:28] to somebody the other day about how a
[3:29] lot of times when you go to work you're
[3:31] surrounded by
[3:32] people that complain about everything
[3:34] complaining about their boss and playing
[3:35] about the things that they're they're
[3:36] doing and but yet you are a real
[3:38] christian in the workplace
[3:40] they realize that sometimes it's going
[3:42] to be hard and sometimes you're going to
[3:44] have to have hard tasks and you know no
[3:46] matter not just in your work but in your
[3:48] you know if you if you have suffering in
[3:50] your body there's a purpose for that but
[3:52] god is god is bringing you to a place
[3:54] where you trust in him and have
[3:55] confidence in him so
[3:57] you know
[3:58] it changes your outlook it'll change
[4:00] your outlook of a christian when you're
[4:01] in the workplace and you you don't look
[4:03] at things as just some kind of a burden
[4:04] anymore but you're trying to do the very
[4:06] best you can because you're trying to
[4:07] serve an almighty god
[4:10] so the word perfect paul said and being
[4:12] made perfect he became the author of
[4:14] eternal salvation and to all them that
[4:16] obey him the per that word perfect kind
[4:17] of stumbles us sometimes because we
[4:19] think well how can i how can i be
[4:21] perfect and we look at all of our
[4:22] frailties and our mistakes and things
[4:25] but what perfect here means is that word
[4:28] tell you i don't know if i'm pronouncing
[4:30] that right but it means to to to finish
[4:33] like you you're you're
[4:35] molding some out of clay or making a pot
[4:37] or like a potter and when it's finished
[4:39] off it's going to be polished it's going
[4:41] to be glazed it's going to be set aside
[4:43] it's going to go through the
[4:44] the furnace and be uh go through the
[4:46] fire of of troubles and suffering and
[4:49] things and after that comes out you can
[4:50] put it into use and it's going to be
[4:52] it's going to be finished and there the
[4:55] finished work so to to perfect in this
[4:58] sense means to to finish to fulfill to
[5:01] be perfect to consecrate or that that
[5:03] bullet number one to make perfect
[5:05] complete
[5:06] to carry through completely to
[5:08] accomplish finish bring to an end
[5:11] and that bullet number four to
[5:13] accomplish bring to a close or
[5:14] fulfillment by event the prophecies of
[5:17] the scriptures
[5:18] so there's you know there's prophecies
[5:20] prophecies that god is fulfilling in
[5:21] your life and of course we know we know
[5:24] that we know our purpose our purpose in
[5:26] this age is to come to adoption our
[5:28] purpose in this age is to come to a full
[5:31] complete oneness with christ
[5:33] where where we're just all of the world
[5:36] is baked out of us all of our
[5:37] denominational ideas and our old worldly
[5:40] thinking is baked out of us until god
[5:43] looks at us and says
[5:44] that they're acting just like i am
[5:47] they're they're thinking like i am and
[5:49] they're doing like i am and i can really
[5:50] use this person in a way that i wasn't
[5:53] able to use anybody like the way that i
[5:55] wanted to all down through the seven
[5:56] church ages because now in this age i
[5:59] can perfect somebody and how is it going
[6:01] to perfect us by the word
[6:05] so paul's talking about he being made
[6:06] perfect he became the author of eternal
[6:08] salvation unto all them that obey him
[6:10] now you think so he became the author of
[6:12] eternal salvation and and you compare
[6:14] that with hebrews 12 verses 2 that we're
[6:17] getting to eventually and that says
[6:19] looking unto jesus the author the author
[6:22] means he started he started the book
[6:24] he started the process
[6:26] and the finisher of our faith who for
[6:29] the joy that was set before him endured
[6:31] the cross despising the shame and set
[6:32] down at the right hand of the throne of
[6:34] god so he's the finisher and in this
[6:36] sense finish finisher means i've got a
[6:38] picture of
[6:39] of somebody getting they've got a
[6:41] polisher and they're polishing up some
[6:43] steel that they they've made
[6:45] in a factory maybe it's kind of hard to
[6:47] see in this picture
[6:48] because i didn't have much room to put
[6:50] that on the slide but you know finishing
[6:52] finishing sometimes is a little bit
[6:54] rough when you get that polisher out and
[6:56] you're you're you're holding it down
[6:58] grinding away stuff and and getting all
[7:00] the all the stuff that ain't supposed to
[7:01] be there away and but but when you're
[7:04] done then you'll be able to hold that
[7:06] that steel up that they're polishing and
[7:08] see the author's reflection in it and
[7:10] you can it's you'll be like a mirror
[7:12] that you can hold hold it up to the word
[7:14] of god and say well
[7:16] what i read in the scripture is i'm
[7:18] actually living out in my life and and
[7:20] and that's what perfection means
[7:22] perfection is perfection means to come
[7:24] to maturity
[7:26] so so perfection here in in the uh the
[7:29] finisher that the definition there in
[7:31] the greek word means to moral and
[7:33] spiritual perfection
[7:35] so growing up from
[7:37] from a little baby
[7:38] up to up to a man and you you think
[7:41] about
[7:42] the the final state the perfection of
[7:44] jesus's life
[7:46] the maturity of his life
[7:48] wound up with him given everything just
[7:52] laying everything down in the garden of
[7:53] gethsemane
[7:54] laying everything down and going up and
[7:57] dying on that cross
[7:58] and that's really what your perfection
[8:00] winds up in as well as you lay down
[8:02] everything of your own life right you
[8:04] lay down all of your will and all of
[8:06] your desires and just become
[8:08] like a like a bride adorned for a
[8:10] husband that lays down everything at her
[8:12] husband's feet
[8:13] and says i'm willing to be subject to
[8:15] you
[8:16] whatever you want me to be
[8:18] i'm willing to do it
[8:21] so jesus
[8:22] was called of god and high priest after
[8:24] the order of melchizedek after the order
[8:27] now that sometimes paul you really gotta
[8:29] think about the things and meditate on
[8:31] the things that he's saying because
[8:32] they're so they're so deep and rich like
[8:35] a little uh like a treasure chest that
[8:37] you open up and it's packed full of
[8:39] wonderful treats and so you think
[8:41] meditate on the after the order of
[8:43] melchizedek and the order of melchizedek
[8:46] is is different from the order of aaron
[8:48] the order of aaron where a man could die
[8:50] and and and then you have to give the
[8:53] give the priesthood over to us his son
[8:55] or whoever
[8:57] would be next and and on and on but the
[8:59] order of melchizedek is god coming down
[9:02] and revealing himself in flesh yes so
[9:05] that's the order we're talking about so
[9:07] in hebrews chapter 6 verse chapter 6
[9:10] part 3 that brother ram preached back in
[9:12] 1957 he said what came to pass
[9:15] one day down there when abraham was
[9:17] sitting in his tent
[9:19] when abraham was sitting in his tent god
[9:21] came up to him in a body of flesh
[9:24] oh you say brother graham he was we'll
[9:25] find out here meeting abraham before
[9:27] that in the order of melchizedek a body
[9:30] of flesh which was god
[9:32] sure it was he was god in flesh
[9:35] you say then brother branham why would
[9:36] he have to come back and be born he
[9:38] wasn't born he was just created a body
[9:40] that he dwelt in melchizedek was the
[9:43] king of salem which is the king of
[9:45] jerusalem
[9:46] which is the king of peace which had
[9:48] neither father nor mother beginning of
[9:50] days or ending of life
[9:52] jesus had both father and mother in the
[9:54] beginning of days and ending of life but
[9:56] he was made after the order of
[9:58] melchizedek which had no beginning of
[10:01] days or ending of life melchizedek was
[10:05] god himself
[10:06] melchizedek was jehovah god the same one
[10:09] that met abraham years later in front of
[10:11] his tent
[10:12] so i i'm just kind of diving in
[10:15] skimming the surface of this before we
[10:17] dive into it a lot more in hebrews
[10:19] chapter 7 but just to begin to think
[10:22] upon the the fact of the matter that
[10:24] jesus was god in flesh just as
[10:26] melchizedek that came to abraham was god
[10:28] in flesh
[10:31] so paul's saying call of god and high
[10:33] priest after the order of melchizedek of
[10:35] whom we have many things to say he
[10:37] wanted to say a lot about melchizedek
[10:39] and that's a very deep topic that was a
[10:41] very deep topic for them back there in
[10:43] that age when they were sitting there
[10:44] and people are falling sleeping in his
[10:46] sermons like that man that fell asleep
[10:48] in and uh he had to he pray over him and
[10:51] raise him from the dead
[10:53] but paul wanted to say a lot about him
[10:56] of whom we have many things to say and
[10:57] hard to be uttered seeing you are dull
[10:59] of hearing
[11:01] now that's something to think about that
[11:02] they would be dull of hearing back there
[11:04] in that lying age when the word began to
[11:06] go forth and its full authority and
[11:08] power and but you know dull of hearing
[11:10] if we just examine that that what that
[11:13] means is it's slow
[11:15] and sluggish
[11:17] and indolent
[11:18] and dull
[11:20] and languid
[11:21] you see i've got a little picture over
[11:23] there somebody that's indolent
[11:25] saying this is the most amount of work
[11:27] you do your laziness can be called
[11:29] indolence an indolent person somebody's
[11:32] that's dull of hearing as they say they
[11:34] just they're not too interested they
[11:36] just kind of think well we're you know
[11:38] it's melchizedek why why we have to why
[11:41] would we want to know about that
[11:46] paul said for when for the time you
[11:47] ought to be teachers you ought to be
[11:49] able to share with other people what you
[11:51] know about these things
[11:53] you have need that one teach you again
[11:55] which be the first principles of the
[11:56] oracles of god and have become such as
[11:58] have need of milk and not of strong meat
[12:01] see he's saying that
[12:03] you know you got to start off with your
[12:04] abcs
[12:05] you got to start off with just just the
[12:07] basics
[12:08] but there comes a time when you should
[12:10] be able to understand algebra
[12:12] you know i i
[12:13] i this this is not the best i i feel
[12:16] like sometimes the problem that we we
[12:18] struggle with when you look at this
[12:19] example of algebra is that sometimes it
[12:21] makes you think
[12:22] well you got to be like really smart or
[12:24] something to understand the message but
[12:26] i want to maybe stress that you don't
[12:28] have to be you don't have to have a
[12:30] college degree because the message can
[12:32] be understand by somebody like peter who
[12:34] preached in ii peter 1 about the statue
[12:36] of a perfect man it can be understand
[12:39] understood by the unlearned the
[12:40] unscholarly or whatever
[12:42] it can be understood is it's as simple
[12:44] as you plant a corn of wheat in the
[12:46] ground and it grows and grows and grows
[12:47] and if you just plant that wheat that
[12:49] corn wheat in the ground it's going to
[12:50] come up
[12:51] but
[12:52] the understanding he's talking about he
[12:54] what he's really talking about is do you
[12:55] have a desire to understand
[12:58] you you ought to be at the place where
[12:59] you understand he's saying you you have
[13:01] need that one teach you again which be
[13:03] the first principles of the oracles of
[13:04] god so again what's paul talking about
[13:07] he's talking about bringing us to
[13:08] perfection
[13:09] and the only way that you're going to
[13:11] come to perfection
[13:12] to full oneness with god is if you have
[13:14] that desire in you to to to know and and
[13:17] you want you want to know more about god
[13:20] and you eat that word and you take it in
[13:22] until you become that
[13:25] so in the seal of the christ brother
[13:27] brown said if we have served the lord
[13:28] you christians all these years this time
[13:30] we were getting off of a milk diet
[13:32] time we were able to eat some strong
[13:34] meat
[13:35] the strong meat is here for us
[13:37] and the holy spirit will feed it to us
[13:39] if we'll only open up and let him do it
[13:42] and in the uncertain sound he said won't
[13:44] you please father take each one of them
[13:45] into lie loving care and give them of
[13:47] the sincere milk of the gospel now
[13:49] and if they have already taken that may
[13:52] they receive strong meat now and become
[13:54] full christians
[13:56] never know more to tattle with the world
[13:58] and indulge in the world but be real men
[14:01] and women believing the certain sound
[14:04] that the gospel is true
[14:06] no matter who says it's not
[14:08] so now he's saying give them of the
[14:10] sincere milk of the gospel we need we
[14:12] need milk but now once you have milk
[14:15] then it's time to go on towards some
[14:17] meat now what is meat what what is meat
[14:20] now
[14:23] so meat now if we could just take i mean
[14:25] some examples in the scripture of meat
[14:27] romans 8 that talks about your growth
[14:30] romans 8 that talks with that brother
[14:32] brother wade's been preaching on romans
[14:33] 8 that's that's that's some meaty stuff
[14:37] that talks about how you you come forth
[14:39] crying out of a father and then you he
[14:40] you're you're growing on up to
[14:42] manifested sons and until we all come to
[14:45] the adoption to with the redemption of
[14:46] the body
[14:47] uh ii peter 1 talking about the statue
[14:49] of perfect man
[14:51] ephesians 4 that talks about how that
[14:52] god gave gifts into the church
[14:54] to bring you he gave the apostles
[14:56] prophets and and so forth to bring you
[14:58] up into the full stature of a perfect
[15:00] man
[15:01] to bring you up into that luke 17 all
[15:03] those things are prophecies of the
[15:04] coming of the son of man well what is
[15:05] the son of man see you're getting into
[15:07] that's a meat that that a little baby is
[15:09] not going to be able to understand
[15:12] now but i want to i want to stress too
[15:13] that you know
[15:16] we will say sometimes when somebody new
[15:18] comes into the church or what what not
[15:19] we'll say well you know you you don't
[15:21] want to give them the seven seal book
[15:23] because that's that's meat and so you
[15:25] don't give a baby meat because it takes
[15:27] a while for them to grow up to that
[15:29] so
[15:30] a little baby a baby needs a broken up a
[15:33] little bit more
[15:35] in matthew chapter 24 that talks about
[15:37] the seals and daniel 9 and daniel 70
[15:40] weeks and hebrews 7 that we've been
[15:42] reading and who is this melchizedek who
[15:44] is that who was that melchizedek how do
[15:46] you what is what is the importance of
[15:48] melchizedek and the whole book of
[15:49] revelation
[15:50] that's strong meat where you can begin
[15:53] to talk about the seven churches and the
[15:54] seven spirits before god and seven
[15:56] trumpets and seven vials and all those
[15:58] things that's that's meat
[16:00] and that's good that's what's gonna make
[16:02] a perfect church a strong church is when
[16:04] you can get into meat
[16:06] and you talk about the sermons that
[16:07] brother and preached that were meaty the
[16:09] meaty sermons the third exodus what's
[16:11] that why christ speak and perfect faith
[16:14] and the token and the super sign and who
[16:16] is this melchizedek and god identifying
[16:19] himself by his own characteristics they
[16:20] identified christ of all ages and birth
[16:23] pains and the seed shall not be aired
[16:25] with the shuck and the choosing of a
[16:26] bride and spiritual food and due season
[16:28] and the invisible union of the bride of
[16:30] christ
[16:31] that's some meat
[16:33] that's a meat that somebody can a a a a
[16:36] mature christian could eat on and get
[16:37] something out of but right
[16:39] you know babies babies are wonderful we
[16:42] love babies we we don't you know we're
[16:45] we're not a church where we like look
[16:47] down on babies because you know you know
[16:48] when you're if you're uh
[16:50] your grandparent in here or a new parent
[16:52] you you get that little baby in your
[16:54] arms and it's it's just wonderful when
[16:55] they go to cooling and stuff and and the
[16:58] smells of a baby and everything is
[17:00] wonderful we love babies and everybody
[17:02] starts off as a baby when uh when uh
[17:05] when a new when you got a new a new
[17:07] convert in church when your kids get
[17:08] born again and they're a little new
[17:10] little baby and they're just hungry for
[17:12] the word that's all they can talk about
[17:13] oh that's excellent that's that's
[17:15] fantastic so we're not we're not against
[17:18] babies the thing is you you gotta go
[17:20] just don't stay as a baby we love babies
[17:23] and babies are wonderful in the church
[17:25] because you know you get a baby crying
[17:27] out and everything and it just it'll
[17:28] stir up things it'll change the
[17:30] atmosphere in church
[17:32] they get to maybe moving in the service
[17:34] and stuff and responding
[17:36] everybody starts off as a baby even
[17:38] jesus started off as a baby
[17:40] you know you think about him crying in
[17:42] that manger as a little baby and how how
[17:44] cute he was and how you know he
[17:46] swallowed up in them swaddling claws and
[17:48] making little baby noises and everything
[17:50] but yet his purpose in life was to hang
[17:53] on that cross
[17:54] was not to be a baby
[17:56] so it's great when you have a little
[17:58] baby but but but we want to get beyond
[18:00] the baby station how how do you how do
[18:02] you grow how do you how do you change
[18:04] from a baby to a man all you got to do
[18:06] is keep eating
[18:07] so now now let's maybe just compare
[18:09] spiritual so paul's talking about let's
[18:12] not forget what we're talking about what
[18:13] paul is talking about he says for
[18:14] everyone that is useful
[18:16] you everyone that uses the milk
[18:18] is unskillful
[18:20] and the word of righteousness
[18:22] for he is a babe
[18:25] everyone that uses milk is unskillful in
[18:27] the word of righteousness in other words
[18:28] they don't they don't quite have a home
[18:30] down there they're you know they're
[18:32] they're they're hungering and they're
[18:33] they're trying to get things worked out
[18:35] and they
[18:36] don't quite know how to use that sword
[18:38] yet it's kind of maybe a little heavy in
[18:39] their arm and they don't quite know how
[18:41] to what what how how to block and how to
[18:44] dodge and
[18:46] the difference between some of the the
[18:48] you know different doctrines and things
[18:50] they're a little baby
[18:52] and so you look at you look at the
[18:54] characteristics of a baby maybe natural
[18:56] and spiritual just to kind of compare
[18:58] what's paul talking about a baby
[18:59] a baby's gonna get their feelings hurt
[19:01] real easy
[19:02] because you know you take a little
[19:03] lollipop away from a baby versus taking
[19:06] a lollipop away from a man take a
[19:08] lollipop away from a baby and they're
[19:10] going to cry and it's going to hurt
[19:11] their feelings you take a lollipop away
[19:12] from a man and they'll say well i got
[19:14] another lollipop if you want that one
[19:16] too
[19:16] that's the difference between a real a
[19:18] mature person and a baby
[19:20] a little bit a little baby is going to
[19:22] get their feelings hurt oh so so you
[19:24] know you sometimes you have to deal with
[19:25] little babies differently than you do
[19:26] with a mature whatever mature person
[19:29] because a baby's gonna they cry a lot a
[19:31] baby baby will cry a lot they don't
[19:33] quite know how
[19:34] they're not it they're not you know
[19:36] speaking conditions or maturity yet
[19:38] they're they're
[19:39] they get their feelings hurt and they go
[19:41] running back to papa and crying about it
[19:43] and things and
[19:44] or mama and they're always wanting their
[19:45] way
[19:46] oh i i think it should be this way hello
[19:49] a little baby now we're talking about a
[19:51] a little baby that they want their they
[19:53] want their diaper changed right then
[19:54] they want their they want their food
[19:56] when they get hungry they got to have
[19:57] somebody over there cramming that food
[19:59] in their mouth
[20:00] and if they if there's not somebody to
[20:01] spoon feed them then they get upset real
[20:04] easy hey give me that food i want it
[20:06] right now
[20:07] i remember when my when my kids were
[20:09] esther was the one she would uh if you
[20:11] didn't have that food in her mouth as
[20:13] soon as you put it in her mouth and you
[20:14] better be right you better be quick or
[20:17] she was gonna pitch a fit
[20:22] but but now now she can feed herself
[20:25] it's different now
[20:28] and more baby little babies are more
[20:29] concerned with their own comfort they
[20:31] come for than others a little baby can't
[20:33] put a blanket on you or something they
[20:35] don't want that blanket on them a little
[20:37] baby wants you to take care of them they
[20:39] want you to change their diaper and they
[20:41] want you to put that passy in their
[20:42] mouth they're not in the place yet where
[20:44] they can they can help you do with
[20:46] anything
[20:47] and see what a what a spiritual baby
[20:48] does too you see by looking at that at
[20:50] the natural
[20:52] and a little baby can't express
[20:53] themselves well all they know how to do
[20:55] is cry
[20:56] but now like a grown man or a grown
[20:58] woman they can say i'd feel tired
[21:01] or i you know i believe that god is
[21:04] going to heal my body and they can speak
[21:06] it but a little baby they can't quite
[21:09] they they're they're having trouble
[21:10] expressing themselves
[21:12] and they they hardly don't have any
[21:14] self-control
[21:16] they'll just something don't go their
[21:17] way and they'll just pitch a little
[21:18] tantrum you see what a little baby does
[21:21] and a baby lacks understanding they they
[21:24] don't quite fully discern a lot of times
[21:26] a little baby or or even on up beyond
[21:28] babies i think they're going on into the
[21:31] pre-teen years and teenagers and stuff
[21:33] they think they know right from wrong
[21:35] but they they don't they don't they need
[21:37] some guidance they need some help
[21:39] and see that's why we need deacons in
[21:41] the church and you've got ministers to
[21:43] watch and you got your mom and daddy to
[21:45] watch over and things did now hold on
[21:47] now did you think about this before
[21:50] cause they're lacking under they'd like
[21:51] an understanding
[21:53] like like evil did in the garden
[21:56] she thought she knew she thought she had
[21:58] an understanding of what was right and
[22:00] wrong and the devil got it over on her
[22:02] and little babies are not yet ready for
[22:04] responsibility
[22:06] responsibility is when responsibility is
[22:09] when somebody can say so your parents or
[22:12] whoever your boss your boss can step
[22:14] back and say you are responsible for
[22:16] getting that done
[22:18] you're responsible for
[22:20] leading songs in the church
[22:22] you're responsible for preaching a
[22:24] sermon
[22:25] you're responsible for teaching a sunday
[22:27] school lesson you're responsible for
[22:29] raising a family
[22:31] whatever it is you can't give
[22:32] responsibility to a little baby
[22:35] because they they're not going to be
[22:36] able to do it
[22:38] and a little baby just they trip and
[22:40] fall all the time they trip and fall and
[22:42] you know they they need their mom and
[22:43] daddy to be there to pick them up again
[22:45] and when they fall and you think about a
[22:47] spiritual little baby too they're
[22:48] constantly tripping and falling because
[22:50] you know if you trip and fall what you
[22:52] do you just get right back up again and
[22:54] maybe you cry a little bit as a little
[22:56] baby maybe you cry oh god forgive me and
[22:59] and and you just get back up and you
[23:00] keep going again but little babies are
[23:02] going to keep tripping and falling a lot
[23:04] and they need help to eat
[23:06] they need help to you know get that like
[23:09] a little baby bird get the food broken
[23:11] down and and so it's real easy to digest
[23:14] um
[23:16] and so you can so it'll help you
[23:18] and you know they just can't digest that
[23:20] they can't digest table food they need
[23:22] that
[23:23] that pureed
[23:25] that
[23:26] squashed up
[23:27] mashed potatoes and all that kind of
[23:30] stuff because they just can't eat the
[23:32] steak here
[23:33] but now how to get them
[23:35] how do you get a little baby to maturity
[23:38] and we're almost out of time here
[23:40] you just feed them meat
[23:42] you feed them feed them food
[23:45] strong meat belongs to them that are of
[23:47] full age
[23:49] even those who by reason of use have
[23:50] their senses exercised
[23:53] to discern both good and evil
[23:55] so i got a little picture of an eagle
[23:57] here eating and a college student
[23:59] because what how did that college
[24:01] student get there
[24:02] is they exercised they exercised what
[24:05] they were hearing in school they studied
[24:08] they practiced now how do you get to
[24:10] full maturity as you're eating reading
[24:12] reading the message and reading the
[24:14] bible and you're hearing the preaching
[24:15] of the word
[24:17] you go home and you start applying that
[24:18] to your life and you say you know i i
[24:20] got this thing in my life i want to get
[24:22] rid of i believe i'm gonna you know i'm
[24:23] gonna start believing and you start
[24:25] exercising your faith
[24:27] and you start exercising you exercising
[24:29] to discern both good and evil and you
[24:32] you start practicing
[24:33] and problems in your life come along and
[24:36] and and and you you you uh
[24:39] you look as square in the face and you
[24:41] say i'm not accepting this lie of the
[24:43] devil the devil's trying to give me
[24:45] sickness in my body or
[24:47] a messed up home life or whatever but
[24:50] you know what
[24:51] i'm just going to pack this word in and
[24:53] i'm going to believe and confess what
[24:54] christ has already said and i believe
[24:57] that he's going to change my life and
[24:59] changed my body and changed my family
[25:01] and changed my home
[25:02] and you begin to grow in maturity
[25:05] and what it is what's doing that is the
[25:08] food that you're eating just like a
[25:10] little baby and the musicians can come
[25:11] go ahead and come forward
[25:13] the food and that's where that's where
[25:15] you get get to a place where you can eat
[25:17] that meat
[25:18] that god wanted you to eat all this time
[25:22] he he maybe allowed you to eat a little
[25:24] baby food at first
[25:25] but what he wanted you to do is get to a
[25:27] place where you could eat
[25:28] strong meat
[25:30] and we'll stop right there
[25:35] [Applause]
[25:50] then
[25:56] [Music]
