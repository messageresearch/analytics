realizing that the hour is late and lord we're just looking for your return the lord we just want to give you all the honor and praise and the glory tonight and lord we just ask all things in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen john chapter 3 beginning at verse 31 he said he that cometh from above is above all he that is of the earth is earthly and speaketh of the earth and he that cometh from heaven is above all and what he has seen and heard that he testifieth and no man receiveth his testimony he that hath received his testimony has set to his seal that god is true for he whom god has sent speaketh the words of god for god hath not for god giveth not the spirit by measure unto him the father loveth the son and hath given all things into his hand he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him acts chapter 1 beginning at verse 1 it says this former treatise have i made oath theophilus of all that jesus began to do and teach unto the day in which he was taken up after that he through the holy ghost had given commandments unto the disciples whom he had chosen to whom also he shoot himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which saith he ye have heard of me for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying lord will thou at this time restore again the kingdom of israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power but you shall receive power that after the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in all judea and in samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth amen you all be seated god bless you now i want to pick up speaking on impeaching of a witness and this is from the testimony of a true witness and brother bram says now a testimony before a person has to the person has to have an experience before they can testify if you were in if you were called in court you'd have you have as give a testimony you have to know something before you can testify and a witness is a person that has seen something he knows that it is the truth and they're called to give witness and then a witness must know what he's talking about he must not someone told me a certain certain thing he must be the witness himself if not he's not speaking of someone else that could be a witness at the scene he's not speaking of someone else there could be a witness at the scene now i think that being that we see out from our congregation this life is so fragile then that death is so positive we need to come to a place that we are positive sure that this is what we speak of it what that we speak of is right see it is not so it is not nothing that you can just haphazardly as we say accept it you've got to be positive sure that that's right because we do not know what kind of end that we will come to right and he said that's one of the reasons why i'm a calvinistic thinker of security of believer is because that i believe that when a man or woman is in their right mind that is that is the time to accept the lord jesus and get it all settled down once forever because when we come to the end of the road we don't want we don't know just where and how we're going to be sick we may be sick in our mind we may have a fever that could really cook or really cook our very brain we might say something or do something at the end of the road we don't know but you see if you're already if we have already anchored in christ no matter what sickness takes us what condition we are when we go it's already settled we are sealed until the day of our redemption ephesians 4 30 says grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed until the day not of your death but of your redemption see when death's done over you're still sealed i i love that and you know because you know in in today's news there's a lot that has been going on about witnesses and testifying and impeaching and you know so to be a witness as the scripture says here as we were reading in john you know it talks about jesus coming that jesus was a witness and he had a testimony to give and and and he had to make this thing sure but then when he called to the disciples he spoke the same thing and said you shall be witnesses of the same exact same thing because when jesus came and brought the truth he said these things and he said he that receiveth these things he said have everlasting life which is exactly what took place in acts 2 when they received because they received the word that jesus held that jesus spoke and then when they come then it was their time to testify and if they became the witness that jesus was and so we we see how you know you have to have a testimony a true testimony to be a witness and god has called each one to be a witness and as we were speaking of last time you know there's there's three witnesses that we that we look at and you know god is a witness or jesus is a witness and we know the devil's a witness and you and i are called to be witnesses and that's the three witnesses that that we have and to know that that we are witnessing and to know what we've heard and what what we believe in to see these things and and you know to it to be a witness then you know the first thing that happens when you become a witness is in a court trial and and we've seen uh very you know a lot of high prior profile court cases in in the news and you know the first thing they want to do is they try to impeach the witness you know that's that's the first thing i want to do and and to and the word impeach you know it means to dispute or disparage deny or contradict to attempt to approve that a witness has not told the truth or has been inconsistent by introducing contrary evidence including statements made outside of the courtroom depositions or statements of the witness heard by another so when we so when we go to look you know the first thing that you want to do is you want to try and impeach a witness because you know like brother brown said when you come into the courtroom you've got to know what the truth is and you've got to be able to speak the truth and you've got to and you've got to have a firm grip a firm understanding of the situation and so when when jesus came and he began to speak you know he he began to speak there and and john he talked about being being a witness of the father and you know he didn't speak of himself but he said he spoke of what the father had said to him and he said the son can do nothing of himself except what he sees the father do he said that do what the son likewise he was a witness of what he had seen and he began to do that and he began to manifest that was what god had called him to do is to be a witness of what he of who he was because we know that was the fulfillment of the word because the word had come down through the ages through the prophets and and the and the uh patriarchs and all and then he began and became the full manifestation of the word and there he was and he stepped out on and he began to speak and began to point the people back to the scriptures and and tell them who he was and what he came to do and he began to identify who they were but you know the thing is is they had to they had to believe who what what god said about them you know because you know when he when he came to the the pharisees and the sadducees and they they began to speak and they said you know our father is abraham and he said if he said if you knew who abraham was he said if your father had been abraham he said you'd rejoice to see my day because he said abraham longed to see this day abraham rejoiced to see this day and he longed to see these things and he said now that you are sitting here as as the children of abraham and you deny what the word says and so it's the same way today is you know people want to want to point to different things and who they are and and these things and not realizing you know when to see what god has done in our day and they begin to dispute and argue and fuss about it it's a it's a terrible thing but but as brother branham said the holy ghost when the holy ghost came he said he said you'll be witnesses unto me and he said because the holy ghost is the witness and as you know as you as you go through then as the witness comes then it you know it quickens the word that you've hailed and if the word has been quickened in you then the word that has become and it's not just a uh just an idea or a thought but it's actually a life and so you know it's it's no longer as paul said it's no longer i that live now he said but it's christ that liveth in me and so it's not it's not just something that is uh to give us ideas and and new thoughts and everything like that but it's a life-changing experience and so when this life comes in then it's a life changing that because that life is to be made manifest and it's supposed to be an expression and so you know as as when they begin to see jesus when when the when the disciples began to receive the holy ghost and they began to walk in the word that they had held and and it was quickened to them then the life that they began to express into the people then they began to notice and they said they were called christians why because they because they began to identify christ in them and you know it's the same thing today brothers and sisters it has not ever changed and so when when people see us when people see the you know because you say well i have the holy ghost living inside of me i have i you know i am a son or a daughter of god then you know if they can't see jesus christ in us then it's and it's a shame it's a rebuke to us that the world cannot see who we are why because you know that i love that little song and some of you may not know it but i i've sung it before and you know it says when the chorus goes when they looked they beheld him when i spoke they could hear him he said when i walked my every footstep led them all to calvary and if our lives don't match that to a t if we don't if people can't see jesus christ in us then we've failed that we have missed the mark why because everything that we say and do ought to be pleasing to the lord it should be a it should be a manifestation of who who god is it should be it should be a love letter that is written because if we are supposed to be written epistles read and known of all men then it should be that what they see is what the fullness and the essence of god is they ought to see the essence of jesus christ in each one of us not not just seeing not just seeing the old man because the old man's supposed to be dead now that doesn't mean that you don't fake the old man and you still don't have that that old that old nature trying to come back and that old thing trying to fight you all day and all night but you know the thing is is greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world we should we should be more than conquerors why because when we look to see when when he was a witness of what he done he said i conquered all things and you know because he said all things the scripture tells us that all things were placed under his feet then you and i then you and i are more than conquerors through him that loved us that if we're more than conquerors then all things are under our feet that we have overcome but we'll see we don't we don't we don't put our faith in that we don't put our confidence in it we don't realize who we are we don't see that we don't when we wake up in the morning you know we know how am i going to make it through the day you know we because you know many times what we start out today is and we get to we get to the the things that on our minds and the things that we've got to do and the routines that we've got to go through and all these things and lots of times we we fail to see that god is trying to talk to us you know we don't listen we don't as brother jewel always said you know you don't speak the devil's language you don't talk the devil's language but many times you know because the things that come our way many times it's so subtle and it's so slow that we miss what's coming our way and not realizing what the devil is trying to do to us you know we think we think that you know we see a fellow with a with with horns and a pitchfork and you know he's going to slide up and he's going to talk to us well the scripture says that he comes as an angel of light many times when we see these things that they begin to approach us and we see these things we miss that that the devil has tried to to attack us why because we don't recognize him you know brother bob and i we were talking about that a week or two ago you know because you know many times we think the devil is going to sit on our shoulder no it's it's the person that walks up to us you know it's it's the and sometimes it's it you know because and and you and you hate to say this but but it's true sometimes it's somebody that's the closest to you and even sometimes it's it's it's your husband or your wife or it could be a brother or sister and sometimes you know it's just like you know when when jesus was standing there and he heard peter say those things that was contrary to what he had already spoke and told him what was going to take place he was going to be crucified and that he would fall in the hands of sinful men all the things that was going to take place to him but he said all raised again and peter rebuked him for saying that when he was when when jesus was pointing back to the old testament and telling him exactly what they would say what they were going to do to the messiah and jesus said it's going to happen to me and peter rebuked him and then jesus told peter get thee behind me satan now you may not want to try that with your wife or your husband but you know what it's the same thing you've got to rebuke that right you don't you don't accept that but that's what you hear you know it's just like when when job was standing there and you know all the things that job had befalled and things had to be following him and all the things how they had went there the way that they had went in his life and his children had died and everything was lost and all the things that he was going through in his life and he was sitting on that ash heap and he was scraping bowls and you know then he had people that wanted to come to him and and try to comfort him and you know it's like when you got friends like that who needs enemies you know they come and you know they're as he said you know your physicians of no value but then when when his wife comes and begins to speak to him he said you talk as a foolish woman well job bless your heart all the things you've been through in your life why don't you just curse god and die and you know many people think you know she just come out there no i don't know i i don't know i wasn't there you wasn't there either so we don't know but you know i i just don't i just don't see i just don't see job walking right out there and yelling at him job why don't you curse god and die we're gonna why because satan's not that way satan get up there bless your heart job poor fella what you all do is curse god die just pet you like pet the devil poor fella why don't you just go ahead and curse god and die that's why that's why i see that it i don't know maybe i'm wrong but you know that's just the way he does you know he comes along poor pitiful you you know one for bad luck i'd have no luck at all brother jill said well is he well is he woo just the way it is oh poor pitiful you but that's not that's not the way but see we we can all fall into those times of you know living in the dumps and and all the melancholy things and you know and so somebody will say something to you and man it'll turn your day upside down and and you and you'll deal with that one thought that one idea that one thing it said to you that'll ruin your whole day because you'll sit and look do they mean by that why'd they say that why did they say it that way and it's just like you know well you know what when i get a chance that's what i'm gonna say i got my rebuttal to them and you and you spend all day and you know what then later on something something will happen and you know what none of that matters anymore yeah that's brother dale talking about you know your wife will say something to you and then you thought well i'ma give her a piece of my mind when i get home and then she'll meet you at the door and she'll say something she'll tell you that she loves you she'll say something wonderful and it's like well you just ruined my rebuttal i was ready to give you a piece of my mind but now i can't but you've wasted the whole day and other times somebody will say something to you and the next thing you know you're just looking for and it's and it's not something that somebody is trying to push your buttons but something is said and because some because something's already been said to you we get our feelings hurt we get upset about something the next person that says something to us then they're the person that gets unloaded on right and then we're really quick on somebody because something that has been said and it's like you know then it's like and sometimes you know we say things before we they they say you can't actually speak without thinking but sometimes that's scientifically uh i think i think we understand that that we know what we're saying but we don't understand the consequences of what we're seeing so when we say we don't think when we're we don't think it through is what we're actually saying we say what we we because we know what we want to say the problem is we don't realize what the consequences are going to be when you say that but drink many times then you have to step back and say you know that's not that's not pleasing to the lord and that's not that's not becoming to a christian and sometimes you know we have to apologize and sometimes sometimes when some things are said to you then you've got to step back and say well lord i don't i'm not i'm not going i'm not going to get into that and sometimes that's hard to do sometimes there's reason that he's still working on me to make me what ought to be because there's many times in our lives things happen that we don't we don't we can't control we don't know how to how to process it but it takes the lord to come on the scene to do that i was i was just this week i was i was speaking to a to a lady and she's she's went through a lot of hard times in her life and they they've moved from up north and they're they had to they had to move from the house that they were renting and then her her husband the whole family had ended up with covid and her husband passed away and then she had to have surgery and unfortunately the surgery didn't didn't turn out the way that it it should have and so she's had a lot of ailments because of that and you know just i mean when you when you look at somebody in all the situation and all the the things that she's been through and you know she she just lives in this in this constant state you know she's she's so down she's so out she has a lot of anger there's a lot of grief you know and it's understandable where she's coming from and all and all you can do is try to as try to share something with somebody when they allow you to because many times you just speak to them and and they're not they're not receptive to what you're going to say to them but you know and what what struck my attention was this woman and all the things that she's went through and all you can do is pray for it you know just like listen things will get better and you know it's just like listen we love you the lord loves you things will get better but she's she's just sewing it and and what's so amazing there was a as another lady she went through the other different circumstances but you know the same same thing she's lost loved ones and different things have happened to her in her her situation but you know what what struck me about the second lady was in her situation you know she can find the things that are positive so here's this lady and you know and what struck me was the first lady she's like well i only had 15 years with my husband and then he's gone it's like you know this is the love of my life and then the other lady she she is and and and it only take it you know some people their their makeup is different but sometimes i think it's the lord that speaks to people and it shows you to me it just speaks to me because you know she's like and you see other people that are around you it's like other people have lost loved ones other people have went through surgeries and they didn't work out right some people have you know lost houses and and all these different unfortunate things have happened in their life but you know the thing is is there's people who's like you know what i still have my health hey you know and she's like because she begins to look at other people and she's like you know i've had 20 years with my husband but you know i i thank god for the 20 years now this other lady she only had 15 but she's like i've had 20 years but she said you know there's other people that didn't have as long as we did and then when she talked about you know people have lost children it's like you know it's like well you know what these children have had had less time with their father and my kids have had longer with their father and then you begin to look back and you think man that's that's so amazing because even in the midst of all this sadness and all this grief and all these things then when you begin to look and you begin to see that how god has begun to speak to people and you know even in the midst of all their grief and then like like job said he said the lord hate the lord giveth and the lord takes away he said blessed be the name of the lord and you know what struck me is is how how ungrateful we can be when god begins to speak to us in the scripture and you know and this is you know because now it's the time of thanksgiving and you know we can become so ungrateful because we begin to look at ourselves and we look at the condition that we're in and you know what we felt because when we go back and we look at all the things that went that david went through in his life and all of the all the conflict and all the heartache and all the problems but you know he began to talk about the mercies of god or knew every morning and he began to talk about all the things that god had given him because you know what he began to speak from from a place because he realized who he was because when he began to realize and all the conflict and all the problems and being isolated and being cast out but you know what he was still the anointed king of god he was still anointed of god to do a job and all those things you know what god didn't turn his back on him everything went went sideways and upside down and everything like that but it didn't change who he was and you know he began to speak you know and all the things that god had done for him and it's the same way with you and i when you know many times we look and we say well why do things happen this way why does things go this way and all these other things but you know the thing is is god's still in control god still reigns and you know the thing is is whatever comes my way he allows that to happen he's allowed these things to come into my life he's allowed these things these heartaches and these problems but you know what he's made me an overcomer but the problem is is i can lay down and i can allow the devil to walk all over the top of me and i can lay down and just live in the molly grubs where i can stand up and say i'm a son of god and you know what i've been blessed and i'm going to overcome and whether whether i go down i'm going to go down fighting i'm not going to back up i'm not going to quit because it gets hard i'm not quitting why because he never quit on me and i'm not quitting on him i'm not giving up i'm not quitting i'm not stopping why because he's he's made me an overcomer but the problem is is see we can we not realizing who we are that we've been called to this position we've been called to this and that's why it's going to get harder and harder but guess what greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world we've been called to be a conqueror in this hour there's there's many things that when you look at looking in and even in the psalms and and psalms i believe it's 137 there and oh david speaking of them going into babylon they said we've been taking when they begin to be took it taken into captivity and he said you know he said as we were led in and he said we hung up our uh harps on the trees and he said then he he said he said and they began to ask of us he said they asked of us of mirth and the songs of zion and he said he said how can we sing in a strange land and all of a sudden you know hear that he began to look back and say how can we sing these songs whenever things went against us how how can we sing the songs of zion but you know what he began to think about zion and began to look back at those things and he said he said he said if i forget zion if i forget he said then let my hand my hand lose its cunning he said he said let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth he said if that's not my well my best joy my chief joy what what amazing thing that even in the midst of all those things but you know he began to look at the captivity and all the things around him and you know he said how can we sing these songs but later on in the chapter if you drop down then it says old child children or daughter of zio of babylon he said he said would you soon come to your destruction then all of a sudden then you know he begins to look at how can i live how can i rejoice in this time how can i go through all of this but then he began to realize you know what i'm only here for a little while why because in that same chapter in the midst of all that god began to speak to them they were coming out of captivity so they were coming out so they might have been going in but you know what god had spoken to that they were coming out and you know your brothers and sisters we may live in a world that's falling apart but guess what our captivity will soon be over with we soon will be leaving this place we've already been promised a trip out of here we've already got a way that's made that's going to be and say brothers and sisters the word has come to us to realize and say how can we sing the songs of zion in a strange land yes we're in a strange land yes we're in a strange place but i can tell you i can sing the songs of zion when i begin to think about the goodness of god what god has done for me and you know what i'm getting out of here there is a way that's been made an escape to get out of here so when god has called us when we're leaving then i can sing the songs of zion why because i've been made more than a conqueror amen it's so wonderful to realize who we are and what god has called us to so you know what we we've heard the what the what the things that the devil has told us and we've heard the things that god has told us like like i told her last time you know when we talk about political parties and brother brown said that he said jesus voted for me and he said the devil voted against me and he said i voted with jesus so i'm more than a conqueror i'm a winner why because i voted the way that that's going to help me god has made a way for me and so you know it it's the way that you but you but we have to realize what god has done for us and the word and we have to accept that but we realize also that the devil is coming in and his and his job is to refute all the things of the word of god he's come to refute your testimony what god has told you his job is to contradict and come against that and so the thing is is when we realize like i said last time when we realized that that god has given us the truth and god what god has done for us and i said then then we come to the place and we have to take these things and we have to look at them we look at the we look at the things that god has done and and then we have to uh examine the witnesses we have to examine the witnesses and and look at look at their testimony and so when we when we begin to look at these things and then we see you know when we take when we take a look at what what god has said and you know when brother brandon preached the message the court trial there he wasn't he was talking about you know uh mr impatient and you know the in the doubter and and the different ones and you know he said you know they they come in there and they say well god has not done these things and god's not done these things and then you know then they begin to put him on on the trial because he the thing is god never promised us a time limit he never give us but he told us if we would hold on but see the many times we go back and look how many times have we heard from god and god not failed us how many times have you prayed and god answered your prayers how many times when you didn't even ask god for anything that he come on the scene and you realize that it was the hand of the lord that reached out and grabbed a hold of you and stopped you or whatever and guided you in the right direction so when you begin to look at the witnesses then you say well this is what god has done for me and all the times that god has never failed me but then on the flip side when you come in there and you take the same thing and you look to see what what the devil has said and you and you begin to take everything that the devil has said to you and then all of a sudden then you then you know when as i was talking about last time when you when you began to hear the things and you think about all the times that the devil has told you things and it never come to pass when he's coming and he said and he's told you oh you're not going to overcome oh that that's a heart attack and all the other things that that's going to your family is not coming in and all the other things that that you've heard from him where he's got in your way and it's you know and it's not just him sitting on your shoulder talking in your ear but it's somebody coming up and and telling you things and coming right and even when people come and stand just toe-to-toe with you to rebuke you and no and knowing where you stand and god and god never failed you but you know all the times we see all the times that satan is coming and we've heard satan come and tell us all these things and you're not going to make it you're not you're not a son of god and all the other pro you know all the things that they've done and you know all these different things and it not ever come to pass you know and so if we only see it one time where we've seen one time where the devil has lied to us and we called it when we saw the devil had lied to us then why in the world do we waste any time any any bit of time listen to him any other time we get we get caught we get called in in this little thing where and i i don't know about y'all but i i we have we have our we have our discussions and battles in the truck we have a we have a drive time battle it's whenever you get along by yourselves usually when i'm driving and that's when the devil wants to talk to you and you know then it's all the things that went on and all the problems and all these different things and it's like you know and you know what then he he tires up your commute to work listening and it's like you know what you know you don't you don't put anything it's like no that's what that's what we're going to do we're going we're going to turn on the word of god and all of a sudden when it gets to the point that you know turn on some music or you turn on brother branham and you start listening to things that brother branham had you know just start playing the sermons and and things all of a sudden then all of a sudden it starts to get rid of all those things and you start to begin to and or you have to sit down and you think well you know what i'm going to thank god because you know what i got up this morning i can still see i can still walk and so you begin to say you know when you when you start to think about all your blessings and you count all your blessings as they say you know if you sit down and count all your blessings you realize that your blessings outnumber your troubles every time anytime you sit down and start counting all you all the good things that you got in your life and all your problems guess what then all of a sudden when you run out of problems and you're trying to find more problems to think about you know what you still got more goodness and more things of the blessings of god to still be counting on and so you keep counting the blessings and you realize you know what they out count outnumber your troubles every time and so all of a sudden you begin to realize hey you know how blessed i am then you're you know but we will sit and we will take what things what people will say to us and we will listen to what the devil has to say to us but you know what the devil is a liar and he's the father of it and he has so so as as we understand that he then he is an impeached witness he has no credibility he has has nothing to stand on his has no foundation but we will still listen to what he has to say we will still listen to one and then he's like well was that true no no no no no no no no we don't we don't give him any foothold resist the devil and he'll flee from him but do we put faith in our confidence are we totally sold out to what god has said do we fully believe what god has told us you know because the the thing that that grips man is a fear of the unknown and so when when we don't we can't figure things out so it you know we we begin that we begin to have this internal struggle with these things but you know when we again begin to look at what god has done for us when you when you when you begin to think brother graham said you know you think everything that that's in existence came from god is the spoken word he said you know he said even the concrete oh you know talking about all these different things the world all these things you are you are spoken word of god because god spoke man into existence but he also but he also knew who was going to be here and he knew all of his children the back part of god's mind he knew all these things was going to take place he knew he knew what the fall was going to take place he knew all these things were going to take place he knew that you'd be sitting here tonight and so all the things that that we've been through and you know what because god knew that all these things was going to take place and that man would fall you know before before the fall took place there was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world there was a way made do you know before all these things come into existence god saw you as an overcomer that's what what job said he said he saw them he said you know where were you job when when the sons of god shouted for joy the morning star was saying together and sons of god shouted for joy where where were you job where where were you in all these things when god knew you from the beginning and knew what was going to take place and he made a way for you all the way through and when when all these things were going to take place he knew exactly how you were going to look so when when he began to know how your physical body would look that he would come and that he would make you know your great-great-great-grandmother and great-great-great-grandfather and all of them would come together and this one would meet this one and this one would have children and all the things that had to come through amen and all these things they'll come all the way down for you to come here to look the way that you do and he knew that all the things and not only that not only that he would come that you would look the way that you do but you know that in his mind he actually knew that you would come here and he would know what kind of temper you would have he didn't understand your personality your mood he'd understand all these things he knew your likes and your dislikes all the things that are quirky about you that you think's different unique he knew all those different things that make you who you are and you know what he made a way for you that one day wherever you were at whether you were born in a in a family that that knew about the message all of your life or you or you never or you're the only one in the family that believes the message god knew where you were at and knew how to reach you and knew that the word would cross your path why because because you were you were predestinated you had representation so he knew where you were going to be at and he brought you and then so if you if you've come this way and you say well you know i know what i know what i used to be and i know what i am today and they say i know i know what justification is i know what sanctification is i know what the baptism of the holy ghost is i know what the indwelling of the holy ghost is and if you come all of that way and you've seen god bring you all the way through all of those things and all the things and all of the the problems that you've had to overcome and face and and god knows what what the what they call the grab bag of life all the things that you that you have to deal with here in this world and you know all the sicknesses and all these other ailments that you have to deal with that nobody you know not everybody has to face but you do but you know all of those things god knew but you know god brought you to this place and he's given you a avenue and a way to overcome and he and he's brought you this way and when you look back and you see all the things that god has done for you and you and you begin then how can you not just stand up and praise god and say thank thank you lord for what you've done for me when you when you've brought me this far and you know what i've seen i've seen the devil come in like a flood in my life but i've seen you raise up a standard against him i've seen him come in and i've seen what it didn't look like there was no way but i've seen him you make a way i've seen you come in i've said i've seen i've seen it when it didn't look like how it's like how how's this going to work out or anything like that but you know what god's come in and he's oh and he showed you away and that you've overcome when the doctor gives you a bad health report and says you can't make it and all these type things and all these things and you're excited saying you know you know what you're healthy perfect well and you know the devil can't take your kneecaps and and all kinds of other things that's happened to you why would you when you've seen when you've come down that road and you've seen all those things take place you know everywhere i go i always like to get my testimony brother luis and i were talking about that and y'all prayed for him he's he's still got that broken finger we believe that thing's going gonna heal up and it won't be no more problems bro louise he said he said he said if the lord can heal your elbow brother and he said a finger is not a problem but you know yeah i thank god all the time for my elbow you know when i when i went through all that and i went seeing that when i done that impairment rating on me that that physical therapist when they done that test on me they said you only lost three percent use in that i said well i ain't miss those three percent i can't i can't i can get that one there but i can't get that one there but that's what i used to do when i when i used to go to therapy they always laughed on me all the time i'd work out and then i'd pull them arms down that's how i stretch it more trying to get that thing look you're not going to beat me just like dr davis you know my surgeon you know he told he told me he said you know i like to think that we're that i'm good but he said we had divine intervention when i didn't have any nerve damage in that elbow well i didn't have anything that was that was god but you see you know when you see god leading you all the way that he let that he put he put the right surgeon gave me the right surgeon they brought me to the right person and i asked dr david i asked him i said do you believe in divine healing yes i said that's my kind of surgeon you believe if you're if you believe in god touching people yes i do well and you know that's the kind of doctor i want i want somebody believing that you know that god can do things god's a super in the supernatural business we do our part just like brother said you know you can mend the bone you set it and do all kinds of things you can pull a tooth but it takes god to do the healing that's right but you all thank god i i tell everybody that physical therapists when she done my impairment rating i showed her my x-rays all that all that metal in my elbow that i had and she didn't believe i was the same person and you know there was other people dr davis told me those other people had had the same surgery i did and they never got nowhere near the use out of their arm and people never they were able to use their arm and i get up every morning and sometimes i you know sometimes you get so wrapped up in things and you get upset it's like food devil what do you think about that you know i am i'm healed i'm whole and you know you you just can't you and so you know the devil the devil don't want to hang around when you start praising god when you when you start talking about all the things that god's done for you when you're when you when you've seen when you've seen your children wayward and and and lost and all of a sudden you keep you keep holding the token over them and all of a sudden then they come in and and you know then they're living a christian life and they're filled with the holy ghost and you can say devil well we don't we don't give up on them he's done it for one it's he said if you meet the same conditions he said he said you meet one and that's met that condition he said he said god's obligated to meet if you make that same condition god's obligated to do the exact same thing well i've seen god i've seen god work in my life and you know what i'm not giving up on anybody else why because god called us to be a witness and see so we you know if you can find one place where god where where has god ever failed god's never failed me but then you know i then i can put my trust and my confidence in him amen then then when we see what god has done for us and what god has brought to us then then the other thing that we have to take a stretch sometimes we don't we don't realize that when when he said when he began to speak of adam and eve being in the garden being the type of the bride and he began to speak of the bride in christ and he said he said she's born of his bone and flesh of his flesh and spirit of his spirit and life of his life then then he began to speak of who she was then you know what then then he said he said how can the word deny the word how can the word deny the word when you are the word by by the spirit so when you're born if he was the word if he is the word and you're born of the word because that is that is what is quickened then you're born of the word then you are the same thing that he is because he said she is him so then then if you're born of him then he was when he rose again brother and said when when jesus rose from the dead he said he had the mechanics but he proved that he had the dynamics by proving and overcoming death then you know what brothers and sisters if you have the same thing then you know what then you have the dynamics also he said well she is waiting for the dynamics see the thing is the dynamics because everything that you have need of was given to you in this earthly journey in the new birth she's waiting on the she's waiting on the dynamics why because the dynamics is here the dynamics is in you but you've got to recognize what you have he may tell well you know then you know sometimes that draws us back to not really no we have to realize who we are if if we if we were alienated from god if we if we were outcasts of god and he made a way back and he brought us back to him that we are born of him then what does that make us that doesn't make us any lower it doesn't make us any less then guess what god that god has made us a child of god then that we know who we are that we don't the scripture is not just just not words but it's true that's a reality so so when he said he said don't when you're heirs of god and joint heirs with christ that doesn't doesn't you know doesn't lose something well we're we're joiners well he's got he's got the majority of it and we got this little piece over here now if if richard and i we had we had that kind of joint in our family we'd have we'd have we'd have a disagreement you know what cause i'm gonna get mine what was that but you know you know but that's what god has told us who we are whatever but you know i because if that's who i am then then i've got janine's back here too so oh james back there but i come together i'm coming to get mine you know and and so you know when we when we stand up and we say well we're we're heirs of god and join heirs with christ with him that what does that mean well then we say in there lord please help me lord lord i need this i need that i need healing it is begging plead big and pleading you know when i i realized years ago every time i pray for somebody i always always like to you know you you can pray over somebody and you know you ask but the last thing i like to do i like to thank god for it right one because brother brother abraham said that that if jesus christ was standing right here in front of you right now he couldn't do any more than what he's already done for you he couldn't he couldn't heal you he said because it's already it's he's already done it he couldn't save you because he's already done it it's already a finished work it's a finished work of calvary he said by his strikes you were healed it's not so it's it's not that i have to come up there and plead and pray and beg god for healing no brother brahman said the faith was a long-range vision that's right so then when i see you see what he said then i'm going to step out and say well thank you lord because that's what i do when when you pray over somebody and say thank you lord because you know what it's the finished work of calvary it's finished it's already done it he's already he's done all that he can do then the problem is is it becomes ours then it's our responsibility to believe that and walk in it then we set up every day you know what i'm healed i ca i can't be anymore i can't be any more healed than i already am right just just like just like saying you know i i'm going to be saved you can't get any more saved if you if you're already saved then you can't be getting any more saved if you if you're already if you're already justified and sanctified and filled with the holy ghost you can't get any more why because he's already put you in the body so there's i mean that's that's where you that's where you're sealed until the day of your redemption you can't get any more sealed now you can grow in more in god but you can't get any more sealed because you can't get any more in the into the whole into the kingdom of god because you're already in there so we can't we can't become any more we can grow just like when a child's born they can't get any more borne they're here but then it takes a growth development right absolutely that's right so when we see who we are then we we've gotten to this place and what god has done for us then this is where we are what god has done for us and then we can set up and say all these things every promise in the book is mine then i'm not then i'm not waiting on god well lord are you going to bless me with this or no he's already blessed you because he said you know because even our mind is it's greater than what our minds can comprehend what god has done for us what god has blessed us but you know we the brotherhood said we live so far below our privileges but you know then and then we come as to speak as a witness so many times when people stand up and you know because how many times has people got up to testify about what god has done for them and when people get shocked you know what i i prayed for healing we all prayed and then somebody got healed and they act like they're gonna fall on the floor like wow i mean you really or i mean because something we don't realize god that's what god does he's and that's what he said he would do he said that he would heal you you're already healed so when it comes to passage shouldn't shock us yeah but brother said he said it should shock us when it doesn't come to pass when people are standing in the pool in the in the church and he said he said that all of a sudden he said when people are not getting healed when people are not getting what their their answers when their god being delivered he said then it's a time to stop just like the children of israel when when the sin was in the camp then it was time to stop and see what was taking place brothers and sisters that's what god wants us to do you know it doesn't it doesn't make us arrogant it doesn't puff us up but you know what it makes us want to walk in what god has called us to to walk in what god has given us not not to be arrogant because that's not god's way but to be confident in what god has given us what god has called us to god has called us and i don't have i don't have to worry about what the devil says because the devil's a liar and he's the father of it and you know there ain't never there's no any time he's ever come just like they say about a politician how do you know that they're lying their mouth's moving they're talking to you well how do you know the devil's lying to you as soon as he starts talking to you that's when you know the devil's lying right he ain't never going he never told the truth ain't never gonna tell the truth but he wants you to but he wants you to stop and listen to him just like eve stop and get out and not be fortified behind the word not to be fortified behind the word but that as the as the quote that i read the other sunday about oneness you know you grab ahold of that sword and say lord by this i'm going to cut every doubt away amen i'm going to stand raise my hand say lord by this i'm going to overcome i'm oneness with you that's what god has called us to he's given us the weapon the way to overcome he's made us more than conquerors through him let's all stand this evening how the musicians come god has made a way for us and you are more than a conqueror through him god has called us to be a witness to the world that he still lives that it's he's the same yesterday today and forever what the what the word says what this bible says is the truth why because there's somebody that lives it that it's made known he said well i don't you know i just don't see how people can live that way well the thing is it's not us living when you when you get when you get the holy ghost when you get the one on the inside that lives a life it's not you living the life it's him living the life i love when brother brown said you know when they asked him said well did you keep when your wife died and your daughter died and all these things said did you keep your religion he said no it kept me see the thing is it's not it's not us trying to live the life it's letting him live it's no longer i that live now but christ that lives in me amen amen god bless you tonight for the border 596 i feel the poor amen at night and i begin to cry and my mind just fails to know the ragley why [Music] the spirit's groaning
