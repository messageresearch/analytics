a brief testimony a couple of weeks ago i went to the doctor and they uh checked my psa and everything and they called me back this thursday told them from the test that they done that the council

we pray amen second peter the second chapter beginning with verse nine lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation and to preserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished [Music] whereas angels which are greater in power and might bring not railing accusations against them before the thing to be lord and destroyed speaking of the things that they understand and shall utterly perish in their own corruption and shall receive the reward of unrighteousness as they count a pleasure to riot in the daytime sport they are blemished sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they fished with you having eyes full of adultery that cannot cease from sin the god of the unstable souls cursed children which have forsaken the united way and are gone astray following the way of balaam and sons of belzar who love the wages of unrighteousness but on that speaking man's voice forbade the madness of the prophet these are whales without water clouds they are carried with a tempest to whom the miss darkness is reserved forever while they promised them liberty they themselves are the servants of corruption for who whom a man is overcome of same as he brought in bondage if after they escaped the lord and the savior jesus christ the latter in his worst of them within the beginning for it had been better for them to have known the way of righteousness than to have known it and turn from the holy commandments and deliver unto god bless you be saved amen thank you i want to say one thing i always uh appreciate brother kali and one thing

richard he's got bigger than the last time he did that so just talk i mean he's expanded so he can't get up through those little cracks so we're going to send some young folks that are skinny up in there so brother anderson's already requested a few people so yeah yeah i know brother zach black different ones yeah that's what you get for being skinny as fat folks can watch you but just pray for them really because they've got to run wires through this the top of this ceiling and it's just like crawling through a dungeon from there back to here so just just keep them in prayer that they don't run into any problems snake spiders whatever anyway i don't think they'll be if they are you know they're good church folks they attend more than some of y'all they're here all the time the little mices and the little snakies so they're god's creatures too john 1 verse 1 let's bow our heads dear lord thank you for this day and thank you for this people that you've given us lord there's no one else on the face of this earth that i'd rather be acquainted with you can have all the stars you want to you can have all the world can have all these things but i just want to be acquainted with this family the family called the bride of jesus christ and lord you sent us messengers a messenger in the end time lord to bring the big nuggets lord so that we could take the big nuggets and break them down little nuggets to the people lord that's what you said you'd do we're going to talk about you a little while today lord you've given us this great plan of redemption lord now i pray lord that we and we have been given the mandate to finish this plan of redemption for the gentiles lord we know it goes to the jews and the different things but lord for the gentiles for the gentile church age this is about to be over and father we pray that you'd be with us keep us safe be with the ones that are sick the ones that are not here lord the one watching online we pray that you'd bless them lord touch their bodies the virus is going around again it's not so bad as last time but still we pray that you would touch each one father keep it away from us and give us a blessing lord that we cannot contain be with us tomorrow lord and thank you doing the biopsy lord we ask that people be praying there around 10 o'clock tomorrow morning and lord we know all things work too good for them that love the lord and i pray that you'd just take over this service now in jesus name amen john 1 1. in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god he was in the world go to verse 10 and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came into his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of god and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we held his glory as the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be seated in the lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now we're going to get into something today i kind of um backed up a little bit because it's very important to see that the church age that we were born in natural is the last church age there's no other church age besides this one for the gentiles as we were praying the gentile dispensation ends with the bride going in the rapture the gentile dispensation ends with the son of man in the bride back on earth again just like it was when the church age started 2 000 years ago everybody got that say amen all right so that's our mandate is to not just be good christians okay i want you to keep this thought in your mind as we talk about these things we we're going to take another maybe in a couple of weeks when we come back to preach again and i'll read it to you this afternoon just for something to keep in your mind that brother brown said your adoption is not your new birth your adoption is not your new birth that's what he was getting onto the pentecostals they got born again absolutely they got born again but they said this is it they stopped and they became babies but they didn't grow any further so god left them and went to what the prophet of god in the end time to bring us back to the faith of the fathers which was growth development so there's a difference between your new birth and adoption but it all intertwines but i'm going to pull it apart so that we can see both and that we can understand that you receive the spirit of adoption when you're born again but it doesn't guarantee that you're full come to full adoption sure you're adopted into the family you get a new name your name is now jesus this is jesus christ you're a christian now you do things different but still there's growth development and that's where the people the message as we talk to many different people around the country that it's just you know i hate to say it but god sent a prophet well what do you send him for amen he sent him for growth development because there hadn't been any growth development as i've been reading y'all over and over again where brother brown said down to the church ages it was just enough to get you saved filled with the holy ghost live a good christian life and pass on that was a requirement though that's not the requirement of this age it's a requirement that somebody come to full maturity just as jesus stood on the earth 2 000 years ago and said i am the resurrection and the life there's got to be a church in the end time that's going to stand on the same earth and say i'm the resurrection in the life because i have that guy living inside of me and i'm letting him use his full potential because you know what you and i just like brother john was talking about with money and different things you and i control a lot because we're free moral agents but god has predestinated a group of people because he saw that somebody would want it and he saw that somebody would want it more than life itself and wanted to move on and wanted to not be just to know it all but to have the knowledge of god that when there's a question arises somebody has an answer to that question man somebody has virtue that you can draw strength out of somebody you can depend on look at the people leaving the message that people depended on them for years 30 and 40 years now where are they what are you dependent on now if you had a pastor stand up you know brother dale's never going to do that neither am i you got a pastor stands up and says well we're not going to believe brother adam anymore um we're going to be teaching just live good life and you're going backwards especially for this group right here sitting in this room it would be totally going from from it'd be going from college back to kindergarten well we don't want to do that we want to move on with god listen i want a graduation day i want a graduation day where that what i've learned what you've learned god will use through me and you he's not going to use it any other way he's built a body hebrews 10 5 says the body has now prepared me for 2 000 years he's built a body and some were fingers some were toes some were hands some were chest body but no one's ever been the head no one's ever been the head that's what i want to talk about just for a few minutes today and if i don't get finished that's okay ephesians 5 verse 23 as we look in and we have to bring a little bit of marriage and divorce sorry but for the husband is the head of the wife but now look if we stop there we'll be in trouble but we say even as christ is head of the church so in that you how you treat your wife is the way god's going to treat you the way y'all answered some of them questions last night i'm beginning to wonder that's life folks and he is the savior of the body see he don't need saving he didn't say the savior of the head he is the savior the savior is the head and i want to read something to you in just a minute that i found on the internet it must be true so let's read number let's look colossians 1 18. he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence now we go to i didn't put it in here but go to revelations 3 14 isn't that's our mandate revelations 3 14 the beginning of the creation of god that's what our messenger brought us you say the beginning nobody had ever seen him that way before nobody's ever seen jesus christ the way that the prophet of god delivered it to us no one maybe the disciples a little bit but you and i have that all plus yes we have all that information all that godly knowledge all that all the different things that we have but what have we done we we just took and said well like i said before you read where brother brown says i don't know that we're getting them to a new birth we're getting them to a theory or an idea and i think that's why we've been here for 60 years we've got ideas not a new birth amen listen even with the new birth you're gonna have problems okay now look at number one in laodicean church age he is god's creation the first and the last the amen the beginning of the creation of god when god created himself a body he came down and lived in it that's the beginning of the creation of god oh isn't he wonderful now let's take that and say look when god created himself a church when god created himself a bride when god created himself a bride that's his body right and he came down and lived in it on the day of pentecost what did he do he came down and lived in it if you're born again today he is pleased to dwell in you and he is residing in you not on you and he's not he has permanent residency in the people that have the new birth he does not have permanent residency if you've just got an anointing john the one that he go the spirit goes on and what remains remains on this person not just hopping from one to the other because he can anoint caiaphas and him being the one that put jesus on the cross but john could see the anointing hit those priests and say wait a minute what's going on but god told him john you're a prophet i'm going to show you that this is going to descend on a one man and remain and keep and keep on and john said there he is the lamb of god that takes away the sin of the world he saw that spirit remain and listen god's not an indian giver he gives you the holy ghost that's why he's pleased to dwell he knows you're in game but you don't that's called a journey that's called a testimony that's called a life that we live but you know what in being that take and look in the bible you take all the people david isaiah solomon the different ones they had a journey and god recorded that journey in the bible amen paul different ones that journey was written in the bible well listen so is your journey written in the bible the way you came to god had to come from the bible it couldn't come any other way about all right so when god created himself a bride he came down and lived in that bride that's the beginning of the creation of god that's the way he wanted it and brother tells us that we're the continuation and we'll read that just right now in the layout of seeing church age this will be the same just continuing with that quote but now he's standing in the midst of the church as he stands there revealing now watch who he is in this last age now last age he calls himself the author of the creation of god this is another creation aren't you a new creature when you're born again new creation this has to do with the church or the bride this is a special designation of himself because listen we're the only ones that can call him husband i was thinking yesterday you know a lot of people call him husband but they don't have the marriage certificate you and i have the marriage certificate that shows listen the vow is what married you but that certificate proves that you're married and and who you're married to brother brown said now i call you bride why'd he do that he showed that the marriage certificate was here that we could be able to tell who we are versus the church versus the church because listen if the church is not born again they can't call him husband they can try and satan can we'll get to in just a minute that's what satan has interjected oh you're okay you're his bride you believe jesus died on a cross didn't you that's not everything this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of that church when did he start create on the day of pentecost the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride this new creation is not the old creation made over listen if you're the old creation made over you've not divorced you're not divorced yet your husband's not dead you're still married to that first creation the one your mom and daddy gave you that's what he's talking about he said boy i don't look him inside you're new whatever looks like this is okay don't worry about it but what's inside of you is new new thoughts new ideas listen if you're doing the same thing you did your old husband's not dead sure we have problems but you know what your desires were before you came to god you know what your desire i can't tell you your desires and you can testify for 20 years and tell me about your life but i didn't live it you did so you know and you know what there's two other people that know who the life you live too god and satan they both know what life you live you know what life you live you all need to get together somewhere and figure out which one you're gonna live by this is exactly what it says no wait a minute this new creation is not the old creation made over or it could not be called a new creation this is exactly what it says it is new creation it is another creation look distinct from the old because what's your whole creation doing is killing you distinct from the old one no longer is he dealing by ways of the flesh wow that was how he dealt with israel he chose abraham and of abraham's issue through the godly isaac line but look but now out of every kindred tribe nation what's he talking about gentiles he has purposed a new creation he is the first of that creation he was god created in the form of the man what's he telling you if you've got the new birth you're a god created in the fall come on people good grief now by his spirit he's creating many sons unto himself god the creator creating himself a part of his creation look this is the true revelation of god how positive is that this is the true revelation of god in other words this is what you need to know right amen this was his purpose this purpose took form through election what's the election your vote god's vote satan's vote who swings the vote you do because god and the devil is never going to vote on the same thing their contrary this purpose took place through election this is why he could look right down to the last age when all would be over and see himself still in the midst of the church he's going back to revelations one as author of this new creation of god his sovereign power brought it to pass by his own decree he elected the members of this new creation he look he predestinated them to the adoption of children according to the good pleasure of his will now he's quoting scripture there he predestinated them who's them us or whoever connects ourselves to that i like what brother ernie says he said you we are connected to the eternal right but i'll go a little bit higher once you connect to the eternal you are the eternal amen now let's go to number three proving his word 1964. so he god came down after through this and now every son that you eat and born of natural sex birth the way you come then when it comes to a place to where you go through water baptism then holy ghost baptism then the holy ghost comes down at the fire baptism and claims this creation the same as it did him the holy ghost and god is the same spirit it comes down and claims this body for the resurrection claims this body for the resurrection and he was raised for our justification all the father has given me will come not one will be lost i'll raise it up at the last day not one hair of your head will ever perish that is the beginning of the creation of god this is the continuation of the creation of god then the whole earth has to have a baptism he's improving his word he's right after he preached future home and then the holy ghost comes down in a city to dwell upon the earth and the tabernacle of god is with man and dwells with them god has tabernacled here on earth this whole redemption plan justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost the same as it is then you'll never get away from those three works of grace um brother bob and i were talking he did a a chart not too long ago you need you you it's a continual justification it's a continual sanctification continual baptism of the holy ghost because look you and i are contrary in our spirit and in our flesh we're contrary to god paul tells us that we're contrary that's why we read here in galatians we did a little bit the other night that he had to send us tutors and governors he had to send somebody to teach us well you can't get it on yourself by yourself how do you even think you got to be deceived if you think you can get it by yourself you know what's wrong you don't have the teacher inside of you sorry you can't deny the word you can't deny what the holy ghost said okay some of y'all need to go to sleep earlier at night and i'm sorry if this doesn't excite you i'm sorry i'm just telling you the word of god okay if i don't excite you then sleep on because i'm not gonna scream at you no more i may slam my face against the thing right here but i'm not gonna scream at you anymore realize that your daddy can take that off of his phone or he'll leave it there if he wants to all right let's go to matthew 3 verse 16. and this is where this is the headstone we're going to talk about the headstone just for a minute everybody okay those are you there to wait and jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and low the heaven was opened unto him and he saw who john saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon it and lo a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased but he didn't say here you him right this is the head of the church but even the headstone of the church had to grow in grace and knowledge he had to grow in stature amen and being made perfect we read those scriptures before we're going to try to skip through them a little bit but i want you to watch this matthew 17 verse five let's skip on a little bit further while yetis fake behold a bright cloud overshadow them and behold a voice out of the cloud now this was about a three year journey now bear with me when when the river jordan that started his ministry he had a three and a half year ministry brother brown said he went to mount transfiguration and six months later he was killed so there's a three-year gap from here from where he didn't say here you him to where he said here ye him everybody all right with that this is my beloved son in whom i'm well pleased hear ye him he had come to a place and we're going to talk about later on about a growth development and we had lifted eyes i saw no man save jesus only and as they came down from the mountain jesus charged him saying tell this vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead we see that now the son of man is rising from the dead in the bride in the end time listen he can't rise in the ones that's already passed on this is live ministry okay and his disciples ask himself when say the scribes are the last most for why do they say the last must first come they go back to malachi and jesus answered and said unto them elijah truly shall first come and restore all things this message is a restoration message and it's not just to restore us to babies or teenagers it's to restore us to full adoption whether the wife is standing on earth not just the bride okay so now let's go we're going to look at this this is what we were looking at then i want to stop right here just for a second and read this quote go ahead and go raise it up to matthew 24. because remember after jesus said this in matthew 17 you got to go to matthew 24 and jesus preaches the seals everybody with me jesus preaches the seals so now here's the order the order with you has got to be the same as with him if the son of man is going to be on earth in a bride you got to act the same way he did you must be born again please to dwell if you're not to that place you got to stop right there get born again seek god because you must be born again not you might need to be then you must go through the time of obedience how many of us brother dale's been your pastor some of you for 45 years or maybe almost 50 years now if you see growth in him that means there's got to be growth somewhere in this congregation our god wasted his words that's why i thank god that we've had a capstone ministry we've had a ministry that's going to what draw us up draw us up and take these false doctrines listen jesus didn't have one false doctrine not one and paul comes and says there's therefore now no condemnation to them that believe who walk not after the flesh but after the what the spirit you must be born again please to dwell remember brother colleen brothers already know several those are the older ones in the group but they started with brother dale a long time ago started from the new birth and and been building ever since right brothers i'm just gonna i'm gonna use you today now when you got first born again this didn't come into play much come on people we fought and we fought and we fought that old nature right and i know we're still fighting it but there's got to be a little bit of obedience in there that comes from god not being obedient to the devil paul said in times past we leaned in other words to the to the lust of the flesh why we were in flesh but we have to come to obedience obedience obedience that's what we're going to talk about in just a minute but obedience has to come from the head obedience don't come from the hand obedience doesn't come from the foot obedience comes from the head anytime you misbehave sure your body is going to do what what your brain tells it to do the spirit that motivates your brain is going to tell you either come to church or don't come to church do this and don't do that and this is not do's and don'ts but listen it is do's and don'ts but it's a love affair of do's and don'ts a love affair you know look at that obedience obedience is better than sacrifice oh i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna there's too much eye in this right here obedience is what obedience to him obedience to the head that's where the obedience we'll read here in just a second i got something off the internet so then we come look there wasn't a here you him now we he we have the spirit of adoption right here we're going to carry it in romans 8 long a long time from now maybe you must be born again but you receive the spirit of adoption puts you in the line puts you in the family that's why i believe we baptize in the name of the lord jesus christ that doesn't put you in the family but it sure does stamp a name on you that you'll carry that name in water baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ not father son holy ghost and then through obedience to the word is what brings us to adoption then here ye hem mount transfiguration adoption and there's no way you can understand the seals without already without going through this this is the problem a lot of people in the message are going yeah i read the seal book they put themselves right here yeah i read the seal book i know what that is no it's not if jesus had to go through all this then preach the seals you're going to have to go through all this brother branham he preached the seal sure in the 50s but that wasn't his message he had to come to an adoption he had to go to the sunset he had to go to the mountain where god said if you're going to hear anything now you're going to hear it from this guy right here and it's not going to be the white horse rider is the holy ghost it's not going to be false doctrine have i got that it's going to be the truth that's why the seals was the greatest message brother brown said he ever preached he never dealt in any other realm of spirituality this man saw hundreds of thousands of people healed eyeballs popping into their heads their feet just completely fallen their hand completely coming out and even asking a little girl said what color eyes do you want he said i've never worked in a realm until these seals open why because the word precedes everything the word precedes everything if he hadn't been obedient god would have never adopted him if you don't come to obedience to what is obedience faith verse your knowledge temperance patience godliness brother kindness obedience means you got to love your neighbor as you love yourself obedience is you got to love that guy that don't like you and then god will adopt you somewhere take you out backside of the desert brother brown said we'll read it just not today but later on and then that's when i believe that god give the seals to brother branham and listen that's when the book was open that's just what i believe that's when the book was open revelations 10 is the mighty angel coming down and in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound the mystery of god will be finished and then you and i are the john part that takes that book open book and gives it to the people and now what john did testify many tongues and nations you'll stand before and listen folks this message has stood the test of time this message is in every how many hundreds of of languages and there's people being born again there's people being filled with the holy ghost people that are becoming to obedience all around the world now not just a group of people in israel not just a group of people here not just a group of people in lula there's people all around the world that's coming to full obedience full obedience brings us to the what the token brother brown said now the tokens of baptism are holy ghosts but listen the token is to be applied to your body your body sure we apply the token to our children to our grandchildren but you gotta apply the token to your body because that token is right there where it says holy spirit you apply it to your body try that on for size then after the seals were preached the son of man disappeared can i get an amen thank you gosh what's wrong with you people today if you don't like me preaching just find somebody like aaron said wednesday night listen if i'm if i'm wait a minute hold on some people will never never like like you because your spirit irritates their demons let me read that one more time some people will never like you because your spirit irritates their demons i've come to the realization that um dad told me one time a long time ago he said son if everybody likes you you're a hypocrite and think about that if everybody likes you you're a hypocrite because you mold yourself to every person no you got to be your own person i'm going to be me you're going to be you brother dale has a style i have a style brother aaron has a style brother bob has a style and if you don't like my style then i'm you're stuck with me for a little while okay this is not an abusive marriage you can leave if you want to listen i want us to grow up in god listen listen to me just for a minute this is not in my sermon but um you know we voted brother dale in his pastor last sunday and there was some rumbling or some people maybe asking questions about it but listen he's been our pastor for 45 years he's not gone i still value his opinion and the shape he's in more than most of y'alls with the shape you're in hey man amen okay and i do honor everything by telling him what we're gonna do asking him what to do so he's here he's still the pastor i'm just assisting he will decide when he wants to quit he will decide he'll never quit he'll not quit he'll just kind of step aside one day but that's okay then y'all hire you a pastor if you want to but like brother tara says we're stuck with him for another year we can't impeach him listen i feel comfortable because my dad's sitting right there and he's my pastor i feel comfortable [Applause] so don't you think god's gonna still use that man if i do something wrong or if you didn't some wrong he's gonna say hey you did something wrong you need to back up on that or you need to add this or add that so let's just let's just calm down everybody we're okay we're good okay just listen to me for a little while and and you know get your naps in or whatever you need to do but um i love every one of you not my goal is to see you born again i don't care like brother dale said god make me a castaway paul said every time i walk out that door i go over there that mirror say god don't you slay me though i don't feel good today though half the people go to sleep use me to help one person today one person use me to help one person get me out of the way so much so god can speak maybe one sentence listen it may be all me and i'm trying to get that obedience part okay i've seen brother dale yield his self and not want to speak what he really wants to speak but he speaks what god told him to speak and you know what it works out 100 of the time because god's never wrong all right i'm not going to charge you for that so let's just continue on with god study read your bible pray pray for brother dale pray for the assistant pastor pray for these men pray for everybody listen pray for brother anderson god bless him he was that all week he was up here dealing with the devil well anderson's like trying to get this internet fixed and he actually got it where it's faster now inside the building much faster right much faster than it was so we're getting more information you know boo devil we're using your equipment to get the word of god out to the people amen all right here we go all right everybody okay but listen we got to have headship we got to have somebody to come up here you got to have somebody to make decisions you got to it's just got to happen that way we're sheep i'm sheep i'm led by a pastor we're he's led by the holy ghost what took that away we're that where'd that fall apart we are to be more now because you need to raise your holy ghost up a little bit raise your holy ghost up a notch let's look at it that way i need to raise my game up a little bit when the a-team's not here [Applause] same way with you pray for these people that pray for these people that forget to take forgets to take up the offering that jumps in and helps as much as he can god bless you for that that's how our body works is a body against each other house divided won't stand folks so let's bind together forget names bind together under god bind together under the word of god that we've already heard we've got a total foundation that that cannot be shaken all right so now look let's go to the next quote maybe i'll wake you up just a little bit there's been enough light to know that we ought to do right and wrong here's what brother brown says there's been enough light to know that you believed on the resurrection of the lord jesus accept him as your personal savior put your name on the church book and live the good life but as far as signs and waters and the direct way of the sun shining it hasn't been since pentecost all right because the head's not here but now according to psalms 1 18 21 i will praise thee for thou have has heard me listen are you praying for headship are you praying for the headstone to be in your life i we can't worry about whether it's in brotherdale's or my life you got to worry about it's in yours if it's in our life it will project to you and then we'll all draw from that i go back to that vision brother they all had that time about pushing people up the mountain trying to get people to go up the mountain what's he doing to the holy ghost he's trying to get you to go up that's your perfect man and that's what we've been taught you ought to talk to people well some of you do but talk to people and just sit down and talk to them they don't even know what adoption is talked to a brother two days ago he said he talked to a brother about adoption and about the statute of performance that really didn't know what the world is talking about message people but listen much is given much is required so what we do with it makes a big difference so look the stone which the builders refused how was he refused even when god came back on the day of pentecost and started his church or his body there were people refuting it right off the bat paul said grievous wolves will come in peter called it the anti i mean john called it the antichrist already in the first church age down there at the bottom so he was refused he's become the headstone of the corner now let's look at this real quick now they don't have it back here back there so listen to me i looked up the word headship in the dictionary listen to this i i did quote it the other day a little bit because in middle in the middle east the law requires that all women except prostitutes and slaves be veiled headship but from the king's head comes his words think about it think about this we are not our own but bought with a price without the head there is no nourishment or growth no growth is possible without a head this body can be just as healthy as it can be but without that head controlling and telling you the body to take in this nutrient vitamin c vitamin d you see all the things that are what a great body we live in even though it's falling apart even with a fall there's things happening in your body that's happening every second of the day how many of you think to breathe when you go to bed you just go to bed and go to sleep and pray god that you wake up the next morning but your body's going watch this listen even the simplest person knows that food water and air cannot be taken by the body it has to be taken by the head think about that your eyes and your ears give guidance to your whole body your eyes and your ears give guidance to your whole body think about that that's from the internet so it must be the truth but it does seem pretty good i mean everything there all even your emotions your emotions are not from this your emotions come from your intelligence that comes from your head then it what it produces itself or shows itself or manifests itself through the body that's why paul said we need the mind of christ if you have the mind of christ what the problem is is like in ezra we were talking about we'll get to in just a second where the adversary came in they're trying to build the temple god's trying to build the temple sends them a prophet seasons are rubable and the bible says the adversaries they come and say oh we want to build with you and we want to do sacrifice zerubbabel and joshua said no you have nothing to do with the building of this house and it made the adversary so mad though they didn't go back no they attacked the people more they weakened the hands of the people that's what satan's trying to do that's what satan done even through the church ages though the pure word of god being preached by paul irenaeus martin columba luther wesley all that false doctrine was never preached by god it was preached by man man's intelligence got involved so what do we got to do we have to have a prophet come in the end time to reverse that do away with the false teaching do away with what satan being the only controller of your mind and saying look god give you holy ghost knowledge holy ghost temperance holy ghost patience but everything emanates from the head everything so if the head's not here the body's not complete scripture says the body's not complete without the head the head is not complete without the body so listen it's like brother brown said he said god needs you to he needs a body but by predestination by election by foreknowledge he knew they would be a group of people that would stand in the end time and not worry about what the world said not worry about even what so-called message believers say but they'll believe what god said how are they going to do that do a five-fold ministry listen to this let's go to the next um i think i got out of line a little bit yeah ephesians let's just read the red yeah it's hot in here and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone and whom all the buildings fitly framed together groweth not stay babieth groweth babieth maybe not a word but that's okay it is now it's probably in the internet somewhere but look groweth unto a holy temple like brother richard said roberts the one that's leaving the building right now my wonderful brother-in-law he came down here and he he was taught by a message believer preacher but he never heard about statute perfect man you never heard that even brother branham says in the book it's a requirement now if it's a requirement are we having a baby no okay lisa we're getting ready to have another another niece and my finger's on the trigger so lisa when she walked out i thought maybe he was gonna have a baby but we're gonna have one this week you remember anna too anna dale not that that's anna roberts remember anna dale um she'll be having that baby sometime this week coming up so in whom all the body fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple unto the lord in whom also look ye also are builded together you for a habitation of god in whom i'm pleased to dwell but then god wants listen god wants more than you do for you to be able to not cry all the time that's adoption that's coming to full maturity where your name is just as good on the checkbook we'll get to that listen to this let's go to ephesians 4 11. how can all this happen he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists that's why we bring in fivefold ministry some of you need it i said some of you i'm talking to me i am the congregation okay some of us need pastors and teachers but some of you need evangelists us need evangelists and prophets and some of us need apostles it's a five-fold ministry that's why we like to bring in the five-fold ministry to what perfect you now i'm throwing it back to you you can sit here and listen to it if you want to or you can be perfected by it for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all look because there's an end to it till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a white perfect man i'm running out of space here until the measure of the stature not statue a lot of you have become statues statues don't move and they keep their eyes closed but what is stature that doesn't say the statue of a perfect man it says the stature look it up it's it means height and watch how jesus was so he was so in tune with that until they were asking him questions and he stood up one day and he said you can't add anything to your statue in other words what he was saying but you can add to your stature that we henceforth look be no more children you're going to be children you're going to need a tutor and a governor we're going to read that here pretty quick but you know more children look toss to and fro look at people we were talking about this the other day you got people come into the church you know and you see them and like brother dale always said they they like a house on a fire in a fire on a windy day and a candle burning at both ends and they're just sitting on the front row no offense that front row is clear because the ones that used to sit there is gone you'll be okay just sit there but no they they're there and they look it's like it's kind of like the sower of the seed you know you go through the four parts of the sower the seed you sow the seed the seed falls into the ground and it grows up a little bit and all of a sudden what heat hits it then all of a sudden the bible says the cares of the world starts beating against the plant and without a strong root system the bible says they blow away and that's what we see we see people come in this is the greatest thing ever was this is you'd be be weary of those people i like people that come in like brother dale says screaming and fighting don't know if they want this message or not sister hazel standing up here playing the piano smoking cigarettes sorry brother they'll put up with y'all too and just cigarettes with one of them okay i say put up with us hey man but you know what sister hazel i believe grew and staying under the fountain instead of being kicked out she stayed under the fountain long enough one day she just quit smoking received the holy ghost and here she went and then she went on to glory right here behind the piano what a way to go but we're not no more children tossed to and fro and carried away look with every wind of what doctrine every wind of doctrine oh this one over here he preaches he preaches really fast and really he jumps up and down the screams i think we're going to go over there well that's okay just make sure it's not a wind take that any way you want to by the slide of men and cunning crap listen that's not god that's the devil getting in men and doing this cunning craftiness whereby they lying wait to what deceive but speaking the truth in love may do what grow up stature into him in all things which is the head even christ for whom the whole body fitly joined together and what i like that word compacted it's not just loosely thrown out it's compacted when you compact something it's really hard to pull it apart by that which every joint supplies according to the effectual working in the measure of every part as brother john said paying your tithe do your due diligence come to church serve god read your bible that's the measure of every part look makes increase of you the body unto the edifying of itself in love everybody all right just a few more minutes now we go to ezra like i was talking about read ezra and read ezra in that it's not just the jews coming back and building the temple and and all that think about yourself now when the adversaries of judah and benjamin heard that the children of a captivity builded the temple what are you temple listen folks let me tell you something if you don't have any troubles or trials may not be born again because the only reason those people heard that somebody was living a different life and god was building a temple and that's when the adversary came amen if you say you don't have no trouble with the devil because you might be the devil but what's the adversary that's something against they did listen you know what happened satan wanted to make sure that that temple didn't get built that temple didn't get built today he's putting down in your mind and different things about whatever he's your adversary he wants to see you destroyed he doesn't want that temple to be built he doesn't want you to hear about this temple being built he just wants you to shout and and praise god which is good but we've become a bunch of clappers and that's okay i guess a good hearty hallelujah every once in a while help or an amen thank you aaron then then they came to zerubbabel to the chief fathers and said um let us help you build this but you're going to have to listen to our doctrine for we seek your god they didn't know their god israel only knew their god but zerubbabel thank god zerubbabel and joshua the rest of the chief fathers of israel in other words the fivefold ministry said unto them you have nothing to do with this building this is going to be a house of god but we ourselves together compacted every joint supply i just read that scripture but we ourselves together will build unto the lord god of israel as king cyrus the king of persia has commanded then the people of the land they didn't just leave with their head satan's not going to leave with his head bowed then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of judah what did they do they got in with them and troubled them in the building and hired counselors against them hirelings listen a preacher that's not a born-again preacher is a hireling oh that hurt but it is in the housing and frustrate their purpose look it across the country now what is the purpose of god to build a tabernacle for him to dwell in right and satan's whole mandate on his side is to go against and to separate what is satan divide and conquer but i say to you that temple was built that natural temple they're talking it was finally built so god's going to finally build this tabernacle this house of god called the bride we're not going to get to it so we'll just stop right here let's read zechariah 4 verse 6. then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the lord unto zerubbabel say not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts who art thou o great mountain before zerubbabel thou shalt become a plane in other words you got to start on the level you got to start down here you can't start up here you gotta start down here all right just like you can't start driving a car at five years old it's humanly i don't say impossible but boy what a wreck you'd have same way with us what'd brother branham tell us he said you're climbing this ladder and he said you jump or rung what'd he say you'll fall back down by missing that what missing this rung look at every one of these and you look at faith what's the first thing you're going to have faith and be born again brother i'm saying read your statute of perfect man then you've got to have virtue not verse you that you're a virgin that's wonderful but have virtue inside of you strength where somebody can come to you and say please pray for me that's so simple but it's it's hard for people to do who art thou great mountain before zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain what he's got to start at the bottom but he's going to bring forth the headstone who's the headstone jesus christ shouting crying grace grace unto it thank god for grace moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying the hands of zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the lord of hosts has sent me unto you now for whoever despises the day of small things but they shall rejoice and see the plummet in the hands of zerubbabel with those seven he's talking about the seven church ages or seven messengers because they are the eyes of the lord which run to and fro through the whole earth let's read this one quote and then we'll stop right here we didn't get to where i wanted to be but that's okay uh just keep those we're gonna read those last two quotes though that i gave you listen the message of grace 1961 read this and then musicians come and as we read on further we find out that god said jerubal has laid the foundation with his hands he also bring forth the headstone this is brother brown i want you to notice he never said he'd bring forth the cornerstone this derubal person all right he shall bring forth the headstone and we know that the scripture says that jesus is the chief cornerstone and he's also the headstone now if we will think for a few minutes now what's he saying think that the seventh church messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit now that's brother branham's first mandate according to elijah according to malachi 4 right we know he had two but that was you got to get you got to get him back here first not by power not by my but by my spirit saith the lord not by organization not by denomination but by the holy spirit listen god can't build a church through the division through a denomination or organization but by the holy spirit god will bring forth the church into what last days zerubbabel the prince with joshua was the one that was to bring forth this headstone he had laid the foundation he took the people back to the foundation in type what are you talking about he's somebody self the ministry of jesus christ through brother branham brought back the faith of the fathers and it also the second part is going to bring back the headstone amen that's the opening of the seals the seals brought back the headstone you say well i don't understand the seals have you ever even tried to read them what does it scare you for you know why it scares you god didn't scare you satan scared you anytime you say well i don't want to read that book because i don't understand it now god didn't tell you that why'd he give you that book why is the denomination scared of genesis and revelations they don't know what happened in the first of the book and they don't know what happened in the last of the book but thank god we had a prophet we had a zerubbabel he came in the end time and he took that trial and he said i'm gonna build this thing back god did not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts i'm gonna bring it back and i'm gonna make it to where you can understand it god will never give you something you can't understand now you can have questions no doubt because you're human but let me read these last two quotes and then that'll set up for the next time we preach in a few weeks just remember brother richard heights coming next sunday but i want us to be comfortable if we're not comfortable then we need to do something [Music] and i want to be honest if you have a problem with me you need to see brother terrence or or brother bob the two deacons brother dale too if you do i mean really i want to i don't want to be a stumbling block for anybody i do not want to be a stumbling block i want to be able to where you come and sit down that you can get something from god regardless of who's standing up here i've always said i wish we had a i wish we had a um like they did in the in the temple temple time this is the holy of holies right nobody could go back in there but the priest so nobody ever saw but they did hear the voice and i wish we just put a curtain right here and don't worry about who's standing back here the personalities and all that just listen to the voice of god talking to you let's read these last two quotes brothers and uh the believer's position 1955 this is what we're heading to okay let's read if you got that one up we'll read that one first and then we'll read this other one adoption 1960 we're getting ready musicians come on now what is adoption now let me get this now i don't know whether i won't have time to get through this but i'll hit it if there's a question you can ask me a little later on something in the message listen your adoption is not your birth your adoption is your placing so what we're going to do the next few services is we're going to take and pull those two apart because they're different but they have to come together but they're different you have to get one before you get the other everybody okay with that your adoption is your placing when you were born again john 1 17 i believe when you're born of the spirit of god you are the sons of god but you were predestinated now here's what i'm trying to get to you for the sons of the last day we are predestinated unto adoption okay now here we are now this is what hurts pentecost a little bit they say i got born again praise the lord got the holy ghost fine you're a child of god that's right you're adopted into the family but it's not your adoption not full adoption but yet that ain't what i'm talking about see you were predestinated unto adoption adoption is placing a son let's read this next one right here believer's position in christ not team it's in 1955. listen to this you got that one it's the one before that one it shouldn't be if brother anderson you put that other one first there we go i knew it was in there brother brown's praying sometimes we skip over brother brown's prayer but you better listen to his prayer he's praying for me he's not praying for them people in that building in 1955 he's praying for me how many of you have had a problem or a backache or a headache or something and you're listening and brother ram says sister you got a headache well if your sister and you got a headache hello god's talking to you you know memphis 1954 55 60 23 or whatever it is i've done that several times with a backache well brother i see you on the front row you you suffering with a backache well hallelujah that's me oh god our father we are grateful to thee this afternoon for jesus how that she took him up there on mount transfiguration and was transfigured before them you changed him whoa you changed him yeah his body shown like like uh um you know sean had glory and all around it and your voice said is the adoption this is my beloved son here you hear him look and god we're trying our best we're trying our best to him and follow him in everything that we do or say send him into the building just now lord put a fresh anointing on every minister here and every laity here methodist baptist presbyterian catholic whatever they are father they're here because they love you and we're groaning waiting for that time of adoption this is 1955. and we believe that one of these days the holy spirit will move in not with a new birth for we've received that through christ but you'll adopt your church then two different things you can be born again without being adopted but you can't be adopted without being born again so you got to start right everybody stand on their feet god bless you sorry it took a little bit long it's 11 57. let's just sing a song if you have a need if you have any just believe in your heart okay believe in your heart where you sitting and pray for brother louise he's down he's downstairs editing trying to get it down to where we won't be here till midnight so no he'll be fine if he can't finish he can finish wednesday night so um we love you with the love of the lord we want to go come to adoption we don't want to just come to just be a christian come in and sit down i want god to work in your life where you can come up here and give a testimony that said hey god told me not to go down that road right there because it's going to be a wreck and somebody stand up here and say brother ryan i saw in a vision that you're gonna have a wreck tomorrow you don't need to go down that road hello amen i'm looking for that i'm looking for that in the body of christ that we work together where god will protect us and you know what god can speak to you but you know god can speak to me to speak to you god can speak to sisters to speak to sisters even to speak the brothers let's sing a song number standing on the promises of christ my
