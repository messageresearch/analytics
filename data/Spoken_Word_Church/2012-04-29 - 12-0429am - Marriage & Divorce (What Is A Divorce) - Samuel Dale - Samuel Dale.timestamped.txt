[5:12] lot of
[5:13] tying together scriptures and things and

[5:20] matthew 19.
[5:24] and matthew
[5:25] 5. now
[5:26] when we're seated if some of you need
[5:28] the
[5:29] notes as they appear on the screen
[5:31] terrex has got a few extra ones to be
[5:34] able to
[5:35] for you to read along with us amen
[5:38] let's just pray before we go into the
[5:41] because the prophet said no man had a
[5:43] right to
[5:44] uh
[5:46] read the word of anything until he asked
[5:47] the author's permission so let's ask him
[5:49] father we thank you this day for your
[5:51] loving your grace and to us we thank you
[5:53] for
[5:54] salvation and peace and joy we thank you
[5:56] for grace and your guidance
[5:58] thank you for all things and you said
[6:00] you give them to us freely lord we pray
[6:02] that you would just bless us with your
[6:04] understanding
[6:05] and open the eyes of our heart as we
[6:07] sing
[6:08] that we may see you open your word as we
[6:10] read it
[6:11] and all and we fellowship around it most
[6:13] of all forgive our sins
[6:16] cleanse us from all unrighteousness and
[6:18] help us to walk in you guide us now in
[6:21] jesus name
[6:23] amen
[6:26] jeremiah 3
[6:27] 6-8
[6:29] the lord said also unto me in the days
[6:32] of josiah the king has now seen that
[6:35] which backsliding israel had done
[6:38] he has gone up
[6:39] upon every high mountain
[6:42] and under evergreen tree
[6:44] and there had played the harlot
[6:48] and i said after she had done all these
[6:50] things turned out unto me
[6:53] but she returned not
[6:54] and her treacherous sister judah saw it
[6:58] and i saw and when all the causes were
[7:00] by backsliding israel committed adultery
[7:03] i had put her away and given her a bill
[7:06] of divorce
[7:07] yet her treacherous sister judah feared
[7:10] not but went and played the harlot also
[7:14] let's go to matthew
[7:18] 19
[7:23] verse 3-9
[7:24] the pharisees also came unto him
[7:26] tempting him now notice tempting him now
[7:28] we're not going to get into a lot today
[7:30] we're just going to make a scriptural
[7:31] background
[7:33] of the things you know
[7:35] instead of getting into a lot of the
[7:37] points and all we're just trying to
[7:39] establish something but the pharisees
[7:42] also came unto him tempting him saying
[7:44] unto him is it lawful for a man to put
[7:46] away his wife forever cause and he
[7:48] answered and said unto them have you not
[7:50] read he which made them at the beginning
[7:52] made them male and female that's right
[7:54] and said for this call shall a man leave
[7:55] his father and mother and shall
[7:56] cleveland to leave to his wife and they
[7:59] twain shall be one flesh
[8:00] wherefore they are no more right now
[8:03] wherefore there are no more twain but
[8:05] one place but therefore god hath joined
[8:08] together let not man put us under
[8:10] they say unto him why did moses then
[8:13] command to give a writing of divorcement
[8:16] and to put her away
[8:18] he saith unto them moses because of the
[8:20] hardness of your heart suffered you to
[8:22] put away your wives but from the
[8:24] beginning it was not so that's right and
[8:27] i say unto you whosoever shall put away
[8:29] his wife except it be for fornication
[8:32] and shall marry another committee of the
[8:34] daughter and whosoever her which is put
[8:36] away doth commit adultery now we go to
[8:39] matthew 5.
[8:42] verse 31-32 it had been said whosoever
[8:45] shall put away his wife let him give her
[8:47] a writing of divorcement
[8:48] but i say unto you that whosoever shall
[8:50] put away his life saving for the cause
[8:52] of fornication causing her to commit
[8:54] adultery and whosoever shall marry her
[8:56] that is divorced committeth adultery
[8:58] okay you may be seated lord that is
[9:01] blessing to the reading of the word
[9:04] now
[9:09] yes we are preaching here what we
[9:12] see from the message of the hour
[9:15] and proving it by the bible and the
[9:16] prophet's message
[9:18] if it crosses your thoughts i'm sorry
[9:21] because we're just trying to do the best
[9:23] we can to be straight
[9:24] all right and then if you want to talk
[9:26] to me later about it but there's many
[9:28] those so many
[9:30] um
[9:32] different
[9:33] thoughts and avenues and things as
[9:36] you know people as they
[9:38] have tried over the years to understand
[9:42] and we didn't have the prophet's message
[9:44] to be able to
[9:46] to understand with that's right so you
[9:48] know it was just man's ideas and the
[9:50] prophet of god said
[9:52] on the message marriage in divorce we're
[9:54] in this situation today
[9:56] because of misinterpreted theology
[9:59] that's right
[10:00] man's kind putting their thoughts upon
[10:03] the word and see one fellow saying well
[10:05] i believe it this way well i believe it
[10:08] this way well that's
[10:09] you know the constitution is your right
[10:12] to believe what you want to believe
[10:14] right but the bible does that's right
[10:16] but the constitution does so then go
[10:18] ahead with your constitution you claim
[10:20] you're an american that won't do any
[10:22] good about a christian and like i said
[10:23] if i cross your thoughts i'm sorry we
[10:26] spent three messages so far
[10:28] speaking on what is a marriage right
[10:33] you know a lot of people think like the
[10:35] the uh african people you know their
[10:38] ways of doing is maybe step over a stick
[10:42] maybe they uh step into a house maybe
[10:46] they do some kind of ways and they you
[10:48] know they're married
[10:50] all right
[10:51] and then you go over here to this group
[10:53] of people and they got their ways and
[10:55] this over here has got their ways and
[10:57] basic what you would call
[10:59] americanism or really basically the
[11:02] worldism
[11:03] about marriages if you're gonna have to
[11:05] have some form of
[11:08] vows
[11:09] you know
[11:10] and they don't count engagement
[11:13] as being a wedding
[11:16] you know they just count it as when you
[11:18] stand before the preacher or you of the
[11:21] magistrate or whoever you are or like
[11:23] you would say of the foreign countries
[11:25] whoever their head person would be you
[11:28] know to do that or whether it would be
[11:30] uh like in india they pick out basically
[11:34] the wife and the husband and put them
[11:36] together and some of you have been some
[11:39] of the
[11:40] lines and know a lot about it you know
[11:42] but ever what it is when it winds up
[11:45] you end up married right now a lot of
[11:47] people believe that said you're you
[11:49] you've got to stand before the preacher
[11:50] and make all your vows here you know all
[11:53] and then others believe that you have to
[11:55] have a
[11:57] relationship
[11:59] and that makes you married
[12:01] well we went through now and prove these
[12:03] things to you that wouldn't hear
[12:05] uh we can't reread all of it but we gave
[12:08] the prophet's definition of of the
[12:11] things
[12:12] and the bible of showing it so then we
[12:15] we you know we just stand on that so you
[12:17] bear with us and just remember that we
[12:20] did show
[12:21] that uh fear not to take them to the
[12:23] murray thy wife about joseph said they
[12:25] were espoused
[12:28] they were only engaged
[12:30] they had not went through the altar vows
[12:34] and they surely had not lived together
[12:36] but they were married because it says
[12:39] mary you know take unto thee mary thy
[12:41] wife and right back before then in the
[12:42] same writing it says that uh the husband
[12:47] joseph being the husband
[12:49] the bible plainly called them husband
[12:51] and wife
[12:52] all right then we don't have to worry
[12:54] about it we just line up with that part
[12:56] and go on and paul in corinthians 2
[12:59] corinthians 11
[13:01] about verse 2. you know he's he's
[13:03] talking about he espoused us to christ
[13:07] all right then we showed you where
[13:08] brother brown said i have a spouse you
[13:11] the bride
[13:12] to christ
[13:13] i've engaged you right i've espoused you
[13:16] to christ
[13:17] all right now we went through to show
[13:19] then that what a marriage was
[13:22] and gave what the prophet had to say
[13:24] about it and we will read as we get on
[13:26] into the message in a minute reread
[13:28] something to show it
[13:30] but
[13:32] brother brown says when you're engaged
[13:34] as far as god is concerned you're
[13:36] married amen
[13:37] when you ask the the boy asks the girl
[13:40] and she accepts that they're
[13:43] engaged
[13:45] they're married amen all right
[13:47] that was why joseph was going to put
[13:49] away because he was the only one who had
[13:52] the authority
[13:53] see he was physically her husband not in
[13:56] the natural acts and things but he was
[13:58] already everybody else knew it
[14:01] that was her husband
[14:02] and he would have had to catch the first
[14:03] stone
[14:05] to kill her if there'd have been
[14:07] something wrong with mary so what he
[14:09] said was you know i'll take her when he
[14:12] took her
[14:13] they could not condemn her
[14:15] because he took her sin
[14:18] upon himself
[14:19] and and all kind of things you know was
[14:22] was
[14:23] brought to pass in doing it but i hope
[14:25] you understand that and follow with us
[14:27] and we'll try not to spend too much time
[14:29] but just remember the prophet said
[14:32] when you are engaged
[14:35] you are married that's right amen he
[14:36] said you go break that vow i gave you
[14:38] where he said over in the far east the
[14:41] espousal the word engaged we use the
[14:44] word engaged we use the word a spouse
[14:46] and we use the word betroth right to
[14:48] make sure it would cover ever
[14:50] uh culture
[14:52] you know of anywhere in the world now if
[14:54] some of you uh people from um guyana or
[14:58] or uh
[15:00] you know zimbabwe is there another word
[15:02] that you have besides like betroth as
[15:05] that spouse are engaged does that cover
[15:07] it pretty well
[15:09] all right see we don't want to believe
[15:11] anything because it's whatever the word
[15:13] would be used and that's why i kept
[15:15] giving those words and the definition
[15:17] from them and giving it out of the uh of
[15:20] the prophet's message
[15:22] and he said
[15:24] were you bill call or not
[15:27] he said bill paul was engaged he said
[15:29] whether or not and i'll read you that in
[15:30] a minute he said whether or not they had
[15:33] lived together
[15:34] whether or not they had had the vows at
[15:36] the
[15:38] you know the altar or whatever he said
[15:40] they were married
[15:42] see that's what a lot of people don't
[15:43] like that because that's just how plain
[15:45] it is
[15:46] it's in the bible and it's straight so
[15:48] when i bring it i bring it straight and
[15:50] plain
[15:51] and then if it fits all right
[15:54] and if you don't like it that's gonna
[15:56] have to talk to god about it because i'm
[15:58] only gonna take what he says in his word
[16:00] and bring you that part all right and
[16:02] then i'm gonna take the profit to back
[16:03] up that because that's what we do
[16:05] believe that we've had a profit in the
[16:07] last days
[16:08] to give us the interpretation of
[16:10] scripture
[16:11] then we don't have to worry about
[16:13] anything else all right so what is a
[16:15] marriage
[16:16] it's when you're engaged
[16:18] right all right
[16:19] do you go on through the stages of that
[16:22] and if anywhere in that something goes
[16:24] wrong
[16:26] then you've got a problem right
[16:28] you say well i can go down to courthouse
[16:30] and show you
[16:31] i've never been married at one time but
[16:33] how many times you've been engaged
[16:38] we'll get down one of these days to a
[16:40] lot of those things of where we'll do it
[16:43] and i'm asking you if you will to write
[16:45] down your thoughts
[16:47] you know
[16:48] in other words write down something like
[16:49] this i never was engaged to anybody but
[16:51] i lived with a guy for five years and
[16:53] had four kids
[16:54] do you think we was married
[16:56] well you know what i'm gonna say
[16:59] all right
[17:00] but that's just you know that's brother
[17:02] dale i'm sorry you you've got to put up
[17:04] with me one way or the other if there's
[17:06] one thing about it you can't deny what i
[17:07] say
[17:09] come and show if you can
[17:11] you know or show me where the prophet
[17:12] said this or that of the other
[17:15] and then two you say well well do you
[17:17] you know you the way you talk is so hard
[17:19] yes there's a grace of marriage and
[17:21] divorce
[17:22] amen and thank god for that amen
[17:26] have you ever asked him
[17:28] or thanked him for it that's right amen
[17:31] that's it have you ever accepted it
[17:34] but did you accept it yeah like a
[17:36] brother was saying like not saul he's
[17:37] gonna made a good point right oh saul
[17:39] you know he'd get under he they'd bring
[17:42] him down and
[17:43] the prophet samuel and them or nathan
[17:45] one of them would bring that he said i'm
[17:47] sorry
[17:50] i repent
[17:52] but it did what good
[17:53] was a good point he said but when david
[17:56] comes
[17:58] he was laying on the altar before god
[17:59] screaming out
[18:02] so if you received the new birth did you
[18:04] get it by just
[18:05] yeah i believe it i got it
[18:09] that's not exactly the way you get the
[18:11] new birthday right
[18:12] well that wouldn't be exactly the way
[18:14] you'd receive the grace of marriage in
[18:15] divorce i understand amen
[18:18] that's right you're going to have to cry
[18:19] and run run and brother brown said
[18:22] a supernatural revelation because of the
[18:25] opening of the seven seals
[18:30] as god revealed to you
[18:31] okay
[18:32] all right see if he hasn't been you say
[18:35] well i didn't know i needed to do that
[18:37] well there's a quote i gave you guys
[18:38] that where brother brown was talking and
[18:40] he said talking about being engaged and
[18:42] he said you may have not known that
[18:44] before but you know it now
[18:47] that's what he said
[18:48] all right so you may not have known you
[18:50] needed grace but
[18:52] now you do
[18:54] and we're going to need it you know for
[18:55] a lot of things right and we will this
[18:58] is not the whole story because you've
[19:00] got to have a spiritual condition and
[19:01] i've asked you to read invisible union
[19:04] over and over and over and over
[19:08] brother brown said on the invisible
[19:09] union that it was a higher form
[19:12] of marriage and divorce
[19:14] how did her old husband had to be dead
[19:16] for us to be married to jesus christ
[19:18] amen all right now is your old husband
[19:21] dead that's right
[19:25] or is he still alive yeah come on
[19:29] the old husband is adam
[19:32] and i don't care to tell you i'm looking
[19:34] at him
[19:36] because you're looking at adam
[19:38] adam this is a damnit nature this
[19:39] outside part what do we are that's right
[19:43] but we'll get back to those things all
[19:45] right but now listen
[19:48] there's three words in the bible so now
[19:50] today we're going to deal with what is a
[19:52] divorce
[19:56] you can see that when you made your vows
[19:58] that was your engagement and your
[20:00] engagement was your marriage
[20:02] what is a divorce
[20:05] well we went down to the courthouse and
[20:07] we got a divorce you can go down there
[20:09] right now you can get a uh
[20:12] one part divorce
[20:14] there is such a thing as a one part
[20:16] divorce you can go down and get a
[20:17] divorce from your wife or you know the
[20:19] husband whatever
[20:20] but you know and you can get it to where
[20:22] it just separates that one person that's
[20:24] getting it
[20:25] so you you may not know this but go
[20:27] check it out
[20:28] but you better check real quick to find
[20:30] out a lot of people say they've been
[20:32] divorced that maybe legally if not
[20:38] because you can get to one part see if
[20:40] you just can get the part from your
[20:41] husband
[20:42] would see as far as record is concerned
[20:44] he's still married
[20:47] if you don't believe that go check it
[20:49] out i mean
[20:50] i'm not going to argue with nobody about
[20:52] it i'm just telling you i'm telling you
[20:54] maybe you need to know
[20:55] so maybe you need to find out
[20:58] to see whether or not your divorce is
[21:00] legal
[21:02] you know
[21:04] or did somebody just throw some papers
[21:05] down and you signed it
[21:08] well we're gonna find out what is a
[21:09] divorce
[21:12] all right now we're gonna get the
[21:13] definitions of the words
[21:16] to where we can have a bible definition
[21:18] of them
[21:19] all right
[21:21] and that way then we can follow it
[21:22] through now the word divorce
[21:26] as we read in jeremiah 3
[21:29] there
[21:31] that's the only time the word divorce is
[21:33] used in the bible
[21:35] it's only used one time it's jeremiah 3.
[21:38] all right it was jehovah speaking of
[21:42] israel
[21:44] that's right
[21:45] and now that he gave her a bill of
[21:47] divorce
[21:51] now
[21:52] in doing that brother brown goes on and
[21:54] we'll get to that in a minute
[21:56] and tells you about what happened but
[21:58] look what it says there in jeremiah 3
[22:00] and 8 now give her a bill of divorce
[22:07] now in case somebody wants to come along
[22:09] later and try to bring up some points i
[22:11] like to put them in a head and then that
[22:13] way you can't pick it up
[22:15] in israel
[22:17] you've got a problem
[22:18] because
[22:19] he can say i'm married to you an exam
[22:22] divorced
[22:23] because a lot of it was because of the
[22:26] wording that was used for the time
[22:30] but he finally divorced her
[22:32] sure all right
[22:34] but now look this is the word divorce
[22:37] okay
[22:38] now the hebrew election 37 48 the word
[22:40] divorce
[22:42] it means divorce
[22:45] dismissal
[22:49] or divorcement
[22:51] all right
[22:53] now
[22:55] the word divorce
[22:56] that's the only time it's used in the
[22:58] bible
[22:59] that's the meaning of it that's the the
[23:02] old testament hebrew lexicon
[23:04] giving you the meaning it means
[23:07] divorce or divorcement you say well
[23:09] that's the word written out but it means
[23:12] dismissal right
[23:13] so now write that down and keep it with
[23:15] you dismissal
[23:17] the word divorce means dismissal
[23:20] all right
[23:21] now
[23:23] notice the number 3748 because we're
[23:25] going to come right back in a second
[23:27] right
[23:28] now
[23:30] go on to the next one on the word
[23:31] divorcement
[23:35] all right
[23:37] you notice down the bottom it says here
[23:39] it's saying here because you're going to
[23:40] see in a second what that means go on
[23:42] the word divorcement
[23:44] the word divorcement
[23:47] is used
[23:51] six times three times in the old
[23:53] testament three times in the new
[23:55] testament okay
[23:57] and it's identically the same word
[23:58] divorce and divorcement is the same word
[24:01] okay everybody link that in and get it
[24:03] in your mind it's the same word whether
[24:05] it says divorcement or whether it says
[24:07] divorce and i checked all of the
[24:10] connections that's what i was doing this
[24:11] morning when i
[24:12] left my notes i had to run how to get
[24:14] them
[24:14] is because i was making sure all of
[24:17] these that i say to you compares
[24:20] because you can you can go into your
[24:23] understanding and it'll show you right
[24:24] above on the word and it says click here
[24:26] to see where all these is used
[24:28] do that sometimes
[24:30] it might help you
[24:32] to see where it's used because sometimes
[24:34] it's used in a different form of word
[24:36] all right
[24:37] but now go ahead and pull up because in
[24:39] the old testament it's deuteronomy 24
[24:49] you're only 24
[24:51] so we're not dealing we're not going to
[24:52] get into
[24:54] this part of it today
[24:56] so we're dealing with the verse 3. if
[24:58] the latter husband hate her and write
[25:00] her bill or divorcement and give it in
[25:02] her hand and sendeth her out of his
[25:05] house
[25:06] huh so the word divorcement
[25:09] is the same okay
[25:11] it means dismissal go to isaiah 50
[25:15] and 1.
[25:17] now i had to give these to them suffice
[25:18] in there so if we mess up today you
[25:20] forgive us you know all right
[25:22] let's see if the lord where is your bill
[25:25] where is the bill of your mother's
[25:26] divorcement whom i have
[25:29] put away
[25:32] all right
[25:34] now
[25:35] divorcement means dismissal
[25:37] now you're picking up wording that shows
[25:40] you what it means right
[25:42] see whom i have put away
[25:47] dismissal what does dismissal mean
[25:51] to dismiss something
[25:53] to put it
[25:54] away all right
[25:57] now follow that keep that in your mind
[25:59] put it away
[26:02] because we're trying to anchor down the
[26:03] wording to see what we're talking about
[26:06] all right
[26:07] now
[26:08] let's see we've got to go over to the
[26:10] new testament now
[26:12] and we'll pick up
[26:14] the new testament word
[26:16] of divorcement
[26:18] okay
[26:19] so go to where we will be going in uh
[26:22] where we go matthew 5
[26:25] matthew 5 31.
[26:30] it had been said whosoever put away put
[26:32] away his wife they didn't give her a
[26:34] bill a divorce month all right
[26:36] now that's the word divorcement okay now
[26:38] matthew 19 7
[26:40] it says they say unto him why did moses
[26:43] then command to give a writing a
[26:45] divorcement
[26:46] and to put her away
[26:49] now don't get your mind tied up and do
[26:52] because we're smart people and we try to
[26:54] do and that's why when i try to explain
[26:56] something transfer it backward and into
[26:59] even and let it go
[27:01] see
[27:02] don't try to come up with a divorce and
[27:05] put her away
[27:07] the divorcement is putting her away
[27:09] right all right so when mark you got the
[27:11] same word
[27:12] it's over to ride a divorcement and to
[27:14] put her away but remember now you're
[27:16] dealing with put her away
[27:19] dismissal
[27:21] all right that word comes from
[27:24] the number it's the new testament word
[27:26] number 647
[27:29] and look what it
[27:32] says it says
[27:35] divorcement writing and divorcement
[27:37] divorce
[27:38] repudiation is that the way you
[27:39] pronounce that
[27:41] okay a bill of divorce all right now
[27:44] that's the definition in the new
[27:45] testament the word repudiation
[27:48] all right
[27:50] is to in a itchy webster's dictionary
[27:53] to reject as having no authority
[27:57] or binding force
[28:02] repudiation means to have no binding
[28:04] force
[28:05] it means to have no authority
[28:08] or no binding force
[28:10] it means
[28:12] to put
[28:13] away
[28:16] to put away
[28:17] now i couldn't bring up
[28:19] they could go in there in a hurry and i
[28:20] was really enough i hadn't been late
[28:22] they could have pulled up repudiation
[28:23] let you read it but get webster read it
[28:25] okay you should know when you repudiate
[28:27] something that you're you're a dismissal
[28:29] right you're doing away with that form
[28:32] all right so now that means
[28:34] to put away
[28:36] it means to have no there's going to be
[28:38] a place come that there's no authority
[28:41] or any binding force okay now let's go
[28:44] to the word divorce
[28:50] now the word divorce is used three times
[28:52] in the old testament
[28:55] i think it's three of the new
[29:00] so where are a divorce woman profane you
[29:03] know just get the definition of the word
[29:05] divorce i'm just doing that with you you
[29:07] can read these other and i'll get back
[29:08] to these scriptures see then you'll find
[29:10] it in leviticus 22 and 13 it talks about
[29:13] a winner or divorce numbers 30 and 9 it
[29:16] talks about and i've heard that is
[29:19] divorced
[29:20] all right
[29:22] now the word divorce
[29:25] look what it comes from
[29:28] they go ahead with the definition from
[29:31] 1644.
[29:34] okay

[29:41] expel
[29:43] cast out
[29:45] drive away
[29:46] divorce put away thrust away
[29:50] means trouble
[29:53] it means to cast out or cast up
[29:56] in other words see the thrust out to
[29:59] cast out to be driven out to be tossed
[30:00] to be driven out and drum away to be
[30:02] thrust all right now
[30:05] that word
[30:07] there then relates back to where we're
[30:09] talking about
[30:10] how that the word divorce
[30:12] the word divorcement
[30:15] is all dealing with one thing and you
[30:17] come down to divorce
[30:19] it's dealing with what
[30:21] dismissal
[30:22] casting out
[30:24] separating
[30:26] putting away
[30:28] all right amen see
[30:31] now
[30:33] the new testament word divorce
[30:37] and what's what it is matthew 5 32.
[30:42] when i say whosoever put away his wife
[30:44] saying for cause her to commit adultery
[30:45] and whosoever's america that is divorced
[30:48] committed to adultery okay right on up
[30:50] to the definition number 630
[30:53] is the new testament definition you know
[30:55] what i'm doing the greek the hebrew will
[30:56] have one definition the greek has
[30:59] another definition the hebrews the old
[31:00] testament the greek is the new
[31:03] okay so then you get the definition
[31:06] of the word and you can compare it so
[31:08] look at what it is and you this one i
[31:11] would invite you to run this one
[31:13] especially where it says click where all
[31:15] of these
[31:16] are to be used
[31:18] i would invite you to please do that
[31:20] because it'll give you a lot of
[31:21] understanding
[31:23] but what does the word divorce mean
[31:25] to release
[31:27] to put away to send away let go
[31:30] set at liberty
[31:31] let depart
[31:32] dismiss
[31:34] to
[31:36] set free
[31:37] to let go
[31:38] dismiss
[31:40] to detain no longer
[31:41] a petitioner to whom liberty to depart
[31:45] is given by a decisive answer
[31:49] to be a depart send away
[31:51] let go free release that's what this
[31:54] word divorce means
[31:56] a captive in other words to lose his
[31:58] bonds and bid him depart to give him
[32:01] liberty to depart
[32:03] to equip one accused of a crime and set
[32:06] him free at liberty so you can use that
[32:08] word divorce and say i went down to the
[32:10] court and they got away with my case
[32:12] what they done they divorced your case
[32:15] well you don't you don't see it stop
[32:16] that on your paper
[32:19] you know they don't stamp it they
[32:20] divorce you
[32:22] i'm giving you the joy this is what the
[32:25] word is used
[32:28] the words you use
[32:29] is the same word for divorce in the old
[32:31] testament of the new testament when you
[32:33] say put away that means divorce
[32:36] all right now we've got a sister sitting
[32:38] back there that just shook her head
[32:40] and you know what she is a
[32:43] secretary to the
[32:46] uh
[32:47] what is it
[32:49] sister mayor
[32:54] if you want to ask her some questions
[32:55] about these words whether i'm telling
[32:56] the truth or not go ask her about it
[33:00] because she's got some pretty good rank
[33:02] and working for a for a long time that
[33:04] knows the answers to all of these things
[33:06] and if you ask him this he'd say that's
[33:08] right
[33:10] we just don't write divorce when we say
[33:12] we're going to let this person go free
[33:15] but that's what you've done because
[33:17] divorce means to dismiss
[33:19] to separate
[33:21] to unbind
[33:24] that's all the definitions i'm giving to
[33:26] you see
[33:27] all right
[33:28] and
[33:29] diligently to grant that the prisoner
[33:32] leaves to depart to release a debtor in
[33:34] other words not to press one's claim
[33:36] against him to remit his debt
[33:38] use the divorce to diminish from the
[33:40] house to repudiate that's that
[33:42] repudiation we give to the definition in
[33:44] other words
[33:45] the wife of a greek or a roman may
[33:48] divorce her husband
[33:50] all right to send oneself away in other
[33:52] words to depart
[33:54] all right
[33:55] now so we see
[33:58] that summing up all of the definitions
[34:04] it would come out to be dismissal
[34:07] a divorce is it dismissal
[34:10] it is a
[34:12] doing away
[34:14] it is a cancelling of records
[34:18] everybody following me it's
[34:21] it's to set free
[34:23] is to unbind the two people
[34:28] is to have many many many definitions
[34:31] that the word divorce can be used best
[34:33] to put away
[34:36] all right now to be put away
[34:39] okay
[34:41] so then
[34:43] brother brown said
[34:45] that jehovah go back and pull that up
[34:47] the first quote right
[34:53] it's uh
[34:55] the sound is coming 62.
[34:58] all right
[35:00] look what brother brown said about
[35:02] jehovah and what he done
[35:04] all right
[35:06] remember adam's bride was found with
[35:09] fault seed
[35:12] that's exactly right
[35:14] jehovah's bride was found the same way
[35:17] all right
[35:19] right he divorced her and put her away
[35:22] oh jehovah was bright
[35:25] he divorced her and put her away
[35:27] now i've heard preachers in this message
[35:28] preach that he's going to marry her back
[35:30] one day i differ totally because he
[35:32] can't marry her back
[35:34] according to deuteronomy 24
[35:37] he can't take her back and marry her
[35:39] we'll get to that scripture later
[35:40] but she comes back not as the children
[35:43] of god she comes back as servants
[35:47] israel is not to be remarried to
[35:50] to jehovah or jesus
[35:52] amen they were divorced
[35:54] they come back as
[35:56] not to be married back they don't get
[35:59] the new birth right you say wait a
[36:00] minute you have 144 thousand dollars
[36:02] because they got a special place
[36:04] they get an eternal life here
[36:08] all right because that's the connection
[36:09] but what
[36:11] watch what he says now
[36:12] he divorced her and put her away is that
[36:14] right that was not christ's bride is the
[36:16] same thing
[36:20] she's found with worldly organized seed
[36:22] in her and not the gospel having a form
[36:25] of godliness but denying the power of
[36:26] thereof from the holy spirit and the
[36:28] word there's a sign of the last day
[36:31] god will divorce her and take his bride
[36:34] now
[36:36] you say that's double talk he talking
[36:38] about the bride
[36:41] he's talking about the bride christ
[36:43] brown that's right
[36:46] he was his bride because he invited her
[36:48] to come and be his bride and she
[36:50] accepted it
[36:52] just as jehovah invited old testament
[36:55] israel
[36:56] to be his wife and she accepted it and
[36:59] that made them married but then when she
[37:01] played the harlot
[37:04] she was divorced
[37:06] now i gave you the quotes there the
[37:08] other night of the other days from the
[37:09] last message
[37:10] i wrote around and said in luther's day
[37:13] that he put them away in divorcement
[37:15] wesley's day he put them away in divorce
[37:18] not the bride of that day
[37:21] so-called bride
[37:24] the organizations the denominations is
[37:27] right now in this message
[37:30] so you shouldn't talk about this message
[37:31] well why not
[37:32] that's right
[37:34] because she's going to be divorced if
[37:36] i've got the doctrine that is contrary
[37:38] to god's word i'm going to be divorced
[37:42] i don't mind saying it that way
[37:44] i'm going to be put away
[37:45] that's why you better be careful what
[37:47] you're listening to and check out
[37:48] everything i say
[37:50] because you know if you sit here with me
[37:52] you might be divorced too
[37:54] i don't mind talking that way because
[37:56] it's plain
[37:58] it ain't time to play with little sugar
[37:59] tits
[38:01] it's time to be straight
[38:04] sorry
[38:06] all right
[38:07] look
[38:08] there's the sign of the last days god
[38:10] will divorce her and take his bride as
[38:12] certain as anything
[38:13] in here
[38:14] as it was in the days of noah
[38:16] he's going to divorce this end-time
[38:18] people
[38:20] but out of there is going to come abroad
[38:22] how long do i need to preach on where
[38:24] that bread around says
[38:26] that out of the church comes to bride
[38:30] right come on read the message
[38:32] out of this end time situation will come
[38:34] apart
[38:36] there will be word born bride
[38:39] but don't tell me all this other stuff's
[38:40] word born bride then
[38:42] when they won't even agree with the word
[38:45] well that's just your way of thinking
[38:47] okay all right
[38:49] come and show me
[38:51] in the word
[38:54] come on i don't have no problems
[38:56] i'm just trying to be straight
[39:00] see but now this
[39:02] all right according to what we've found
[39:06] the word divorce is to put away
[39:09] well that's what he done with this he
[39:10] put her away
[39:12] all right now
[39:17] to put her away
[39:22] to just
[39:24] do divorce
[39:27] all right now we're back to the
[39:28] definition of what is a marriage
[39:34] come on
[39:35] we're the definition of what is a
[39:37] marriage
[39:40] so let's just read what brother brown
[39:42] had to say about it going to the next
[39:43] one
[39:46] number two on the quote
[39:48] and let's see what he said we've read
[39:49] this over and over and i don't really
[39:50] don't know if i keep bringing it up but
[39:52] it is that's dire
[39:54] all right you read it if you don't want
[39:55] to forget it
[39:57] all right look what he says in paragraph
[39:59] 165 1964 8 30 in the morning service
[40:03] questions and answers which is number
[40:04] three book if you're looking all right
[40:07] can i be a hypocrite if i stood here
[40:10] because my own son sitting here that was
[40:12] promised to a girl
[40:14] and i said if if he never even had the
[40:17] ceremony
[40:18] set over him
[40:20] no matter if he ever lived with the
[40:22] woman or slept with the woman the girl
[40:27] or whatever it was
[40:28] when he made that vow he's married
[40:32] billy paul or no billy paul that's
[40:34] exactly the truth he's married when he
[40:36] made that promise
[40:39] and you know yourself that he refused to
[40:42] do the wedding
[40:45] of bill paul
[40:46] and lois
[40:51] all right he refused to do it he
[40:52] wouldn't have nothing to do with it
[40:54] all right look at the next one what he
[40:56] says i just brought this and put it in
[40:58] because you might wonder about
[41:00] you know this is paragraph 15
[41:03] 6.
[41:05] and you know what he's done run off with
[41:07] some little kid still in common school
[41:09] and got married
[41:11] we are know the wedding
[41:14] no there's another
[41:16] no capsule a wedding right
[41:18] really we know the wedding the father of
[41:21] this girl and myself we'll know the
[41:24] wedding but he was married just the same
[41:28] he's my boy sitting here listening to me
[41:30] now that's exactly
[41:32] he said daddy were you married he said
[41:34] no by no means
[41:37] would he marry him
[41:39] why because he's been married before
[41:42] huh
[41:43] now what is a wedding what is a marriage
[41:48] we just read around said it didn't
[41:49] matter whether he
[41:51] lived with her or whether they had their
[41:53] ceremony you know a daughter another
[41:55] word
[41:56] he said there's marriage when they made
[41:58] the vows
[41:59] all right now what is a simple
[42:03] answer to what is a divorce
[42:08] to tie together all of the things that
[42:10] we've brought
[42:12] what is a simple answer
[42:15] to disallow the vow
[42:19] now you know that don't work out here in
[42:20] the courts
[42:22] in other words you got it in the courts
[42:23] you've got papers you signed where you
[42:25] get married all right
[42:27] then you get a divorce they got to go
[42:30] put it on record that they disallowed
[42:33] that that marriage that you had and
[42:36] they're dividing you up
[42:38] they have made a dismissal to the fact
[42:41] of what you've done
[42:42] well that's simple
[42:45] if a wedding is a
[42:47] as a promise that you make
[42:53] then when you take away that promise
[42:57] you're divorced
[42:59] amen
[43:00] come on to that simple terminology amen
[43:03] everybody says i'm so deep what's deep
[43:05] about that yeah
[43:07] right if a wedding is when you say will
[43:09] you marry me
[43:12] and she says yes and that's a wedding
[43:16] well then a divorce is to take those
[43:18] words
[43:19] and dismiss them because
[43:21] we'll get the secretary back here to
[43:23] give us the terminology
[43:25] because what you're signing there when
[43:27] you're applying for a divorce
[43:32] is you're saying
[43:33] i want to take back my vows
[43:36] is that simple
[43:40] is that simple enough
[43:42] i want to take back my vows
[43:46] i want to say
[43:48] that i don't want these vows anymore
[43:54] right
[43:55] that's right see then when we use the
[43:57] word divorce
[44:00] we use the word dismissal put away cast
[44:03] out turned out run out put out whatever
[44:07] but simple terminologies what is it
[44:12] you made your vows
[44:14] when you asked the boy to marry
[44:17] the girl to marry you
[44:19] and she accepted now she don't excel
[44:22] that's not a wedding i've been through
[44:23] that
[44:24] we've even proved that through
[44:25] deuteronomy
[44:30] if you make a vow to a girl and she
[44:33] accepts that vow
[44:34] i don't care who we are or who we've
[44:36] done
[44:37] you married amen
[44:39] that's right
[44:40] brother brown didn't bind saying billy
[44:42] paul or no billy paul right
[44:45] don't you think he wanted to straighten
[44:47] up things
[44:50] but yet what could he do
[44:52] right
[44:53] well he had it annulled
[44:58] well he said there's marriage right
[45:00] an anomaly is to go down to the court
[45:03] and get a simplified divorce
[45:06] would that be a word for an element it's
[45:08] a little different probably in the
[45:09] terminology but a little different than
[45:11] the paperwork
[45:14] because you're claiming that the daddy's
[45:17] on each side is saying they were too
[45:18] young or whatever it was or this was or
[45:21] something
[45:22] and you're saying they didn't have
[45:23] enough sense to make their decisions
[45:25] right and i imagine that's about right
[45:28] for all of us
[45:29] we didn't have much sense
[45:33] but still
[45:35] the vowel was made
[45:37] all right a divorce is a simple
[45:39] terminologies of breaking the vowel
[45:42] because now listen if that's not right i
[45:44] want you to explain how that in now i'm
[45:47] not throwing off on the african people
[45:48] you know that
[45:50] all right so when i say africa and i say
[45:52] africa
[45:54] all right that means zimbabwe that means
[45:57] guyana that means this when that means
[45:59] that when i'm just using the term
[46:01] all right but in your country you
[46:03] probably don't have to do that
[46:06] you might go down and tell them publicly
[46:07] come and watch me i want to step back
[46:09] over the stick
[46:11] right
[46:12] because it was a wedding when they
[46:13] stepped over the stick the whole
[46:16] crowd or whatever you call them group of
[46:17] people knows that's what happened so you
[46:19] go that's okay
[46:22] i'm gonna step back over the stick and
[46:24] that's gonna null our wedding
[46:27] that's going to give us a divorce
[46:30] because they probably don't have no
[46:31] paperwork to fill out
[46:34] i'm sure they do now because of the
[46:36] modernization of things but you
[46:38] understand what i mean
[46:41] is that one serious church
[46:45] for us to make our vows right amen right
[46:48] and paul said he espoused us brother
[46:50] said he espoused you enough
[46:53] chill book he said i call you bride
[47:01] so we're engaged
[47:03] to jesus christ
[47:05] we're espoused to him
[47:08] there will be a wedding supper one day
[47:11] right
[47:12] and there will be a honeymoon of a
[47:14] millennium
[47:16] many things are taking place right
[47:19] around said while that sick seal is
[47:20] being broke we're going to be being
[47:22] married to christ
[47:24] you say yeah we're already married
[47:25] that's exactly right i spent three
[47:27] services proving it to you right that
[47:29] when you're engaged you're already
[47:31] married
[47:32] so brother randall can say we're married
[47:34] to christ now
[47:36] then you can turn around and say but
[47:38] we're not married yet
[47:41] come on he's not
[47:43] contrary one statement to the other one
[47:46] one of them is telling you
[47:48] there is a wedding in the sky
[47:51] others telling you when you got
[47:53] that you accepted jesus christ as your
[47:55] savior and he accepted you yet that is
[47:59] eternity
[48:00] because that gives you the new birth
[48:02] amen right
[48:04] when you get the new birth
[48:06] your soul is just as eternal as god
[48:08] right
[48:10] come on am i quoting the prophet
[48:11] amen
[48:12] but you know your body and your spirit
[48:14] is still in this old realm
[48:16] amen
[48:17] our body and our spirit as i said well
[48:19] ago is still married to adam
[48:22] that's why we needed the grace of
[48:24] marriage and divorce
[48:26] not like some might try to think and say
[48:28] when i got the new birth it took care of
[48:30] everything well why did brother brown
[48:32] have to preach marriage and divorce
[48:34] if it took care of everything he
[48:36] wouldn't have to preach to you he
[48:37] wouldn't have to wait until god gave you
[48:39] the permission to say it he could have
[48:41] just walked out there and said you're
[48:42] born again we're all going to heaven
[48:44] he couldn't do it because he knew this
[48:46] body that's our problem
[48:49] this body
[48:51] this spirit that's within me
[48:53] whatever good you want to think about it
[48:56] this spirit that's within me this body
[48:59] that i live in is still of the adamic
[49:01] nature
[49:02] amen
[49:04] and you know what
[49:07] there's going to have to be a way under
[49:09] marriage and divorce for that old nature
[49:11] to die
[49:13] wait just a minute now your old nature
[49:15] died with a new bird brother dale
[49:17] it sure did but not the rest of this
[49:22] a lot of me still alive
[49:24] well that's my soul people say but my
[49:27] soul is what sin you better be careful
[49:29] saying your soul is what sin if you're
[49:31] saying you're born again right because
[49:33] you're making god a sinner
[49:36] you saw a soul is to me
[49:38] but the prophet explained that we're
[49:40] body spirit and soul
[49:42] amen why did we need the grace of
[49:44] marriage and divorce
[49:48] if it's all just a new birth
[49:52] because we had
[49:54] sin in our bodies
[49:58] right yeah man
[50:00] amen
[50:02] then nobody can claim goody goody
[50:06] that's right
[50:08] cause the best we can claim goody goody
[50:09] is batty bag
[50:14] that's why i don't look down on nobody
[50:16] but i try to preach the truth
[50:19] but words that preach around the message
[50:21] that you need the grace of marriage and
[50:22] divorce and even preach anymore that's
[50:24] right
[50:27] maybe they don't know what it is
[50:29] right
[50:30] right amen
[50:33] i said it from
[50:35] when i started in this message and i
[50:37] learned what that prophet said about
[50:39] marriage and divorce
[50:41] i said it then and i still say it now
[50:44] if that prophet had not come and brought
[50:46] the grace of marriage and divorce there
[50:48] would be no body body body
[50:51] human body
[50:53] able to be changed
[50:56] that's right
[50:58] there would have been no change in the
[50:59] body had the grace of marriage and
[51:00] divorce not been given
[51:02] that's why i believe it's so strong
[51:05] amen
[51:06] you say well i never had nothing i never
[51:08] committed adultery
[51:09] but did you kiss
[51:11] that's right
[51:12] that's right
[51:16] did you get engaged and then broke down
[51:18] and married somebody else
[51:20] that's why i tell you
[51:22] like i told you hannah come home one day
[51:24] about four or five years old it was
[51:25] about five years old school and she said
[51:27] so it's going together now i'm dumb i
[51:29] said where are they going
[51:34] i'm just honest i don't know where this
[51:36] is going at four or five years old she
[51:38] said daddy they're dating
[51:42] well see kids don't go around play with
[51:44] those words
[51:47] you say well that's just childish baby
[51:48] things you know after a while it's not
[51:50] childish
[51:52] you want to tell me what the age of
[51:53] accountability is i'd like for somebody
[51:55] to define it right
[51:58] the only way i can define the age of
[52:00] accountability is the age when you're
[52:02] come to a knowledge of understanding
[52:06] you may be five years old and you may be
[52:08] 50 years old
[52:10] right
[52:13] it's when you come to an understanding
[52:15] as the age of
[52:16] accountability that's right
[52:18] so be careful don't go around asking the
[52:20] girls especially the way it is now in
[52:22] the land today the girls are out asking
[52:24] the boys
[52:29] well wade made a good point on that day
[52:31] they gonna head ship for that
[52:34] but don't tell me said a girl asked the
[52:36] boy and they lived together and had four
[52:38] kids ain't married
[52:39] i'm not dumb all right
[52:46] one time said you know they said well he
[52:47] all right
[52:49] his wife she never married them guys but
[52:51] she lived with two or three had kids by
[52:54] them
[52:56] well some were his problems
[52:58] yeah
[53:01] right right i thought we were supposed
[53:03] to line up with the scriptures right
[53:07] now i've tried to give scripture
[53:10] i tried to give definitions tried to
[53:13] give the definition of the profit
[53:16] to see
[53:17] that a divorce is to disallow
[53:20] the vows you made
[53:26] that's why you've got to go to the court
[53:28] or somebody has for you or whatever you
[53:30] do
[53:31] you know proxies or whatever they do i
[53:33] don't understand all of it don't worry
[53:34] about it but somebody has got to go make
[53:37] the statements
[53:39] in writing or whatever
[53:41] i
[53:42] don't want to live with this person
[53:44] anymore
[53:47] i want to be divorced
[53:50] i want to take back my vow
[53:59] i want to take back my vow
[54:01] that i made
[54:05] well i never thought it'd be like that i
[54:06] called divorce with a big piece of paper
[54:08] he passed out
[54:09] yeah that's
[54:11] real good thinking
[54:14] but listen
[54:18] when jesus christ gave an invitation to
[54:21] the world
[54:22] what makes their denominations being
[54:24] harlots i tried to preach that the other
[54:26] day right right but make some harlots or
[54:29] denominations or in this message or
[54:31] where is that right
[54:33] what makes them my heart
[54:37] because they want to be claimed to be
[54:39] married to jesus christ right
[54:43] and they're out living with the devil
[54:44] right
[54:49] and see he's going to put him away
[54:53] we read it from the prophet
[54:55] and from there he's going to take a
[54:57] bribe
[55:00] now is it his fault
[55:04] he's given everything in the world
[55:07] that's right
[55:08] i run around am i ready to learn today
[55:10] when you engage what did the man do he
[55:12] just shares the girl with gifts and and
[55:15] things like that you know
[55:19] we had a little funny thing happened one
[55:20] time my wife and i
[55:22] and we were dating we hadn't even got to
[55:24] the point of being
[55:25] engaged at that point but we were you
[55:28] know we were dating and for christmas
[55:29] her and her girlfriend heard that they
[55:31] were going to get a friendship ring well
[55:37] so we get down to the date to go and
[55:40] there my buddy's got a box about that
[55:42] big
[55:47] well they she was tickled to death
[55:50] we was going to go to drive in or do
[55:53] something whatever
[55:54] here i set mine up was about this big
[55:56] squad
[56:00] i got a cold shoulder to kind of the
[56:02] match you know because i'm a little hurt
[56:04] you know
[56:06] but uh because especially when she pick
[56:09] it up shake it and it just rattled
[56:12] she's wondering what in the world have i
[56:15] but i was sharing her with gifts because
[56:17] i was the girl i was gonna marry that's
[56:19] right
[56:21] you see what she didn't know was we
[56:23] finally got back to the house we
[56:24] wouldn't let them open i'm telling my
[56:25] buddies today don't open till we get
[56:26] back off the date and get to the house
[56:28] okay
[56:30] sit down and she starts opening the
[56:32] thing
[56:33] and she gets out of one box and there's
[56:34] a box and then her box nothing locked
[56:37] and after a while she's just about ready
[56:39] to throw the thing in the trash can
[56:43] and she finally looked right down in the
[56:45] bottom of it and there was taped
[56:47] a little box you know
[56:49] for the friendship ring you know
[56:53] see you if you're engaged you want to
[56:54] share your
[56:56] that's right you know you want to show
[56:58] your affection
[57:00] that'll be nice
[57:03] and that's what god has done for you and
[57:05] us all right
[57:08] you know what i was thinking this
[57:09] morning i'm gonna go look it up i know
[57:10] the quotes are
[57:13] but brother brown said one time
[57:16] he said
[57:17] which had you'd rather be
[57:20] sick of a certain kind of a thing you
[57:22] know problem going wrong
[57:24] are being led flat on your back
[57:27] he said which one you'd rather have
[57:34] he said because you got a test and a cry
[57:39] you see all of our sicknesses and
[57:41] everything then
[57:44] it could be ten dollars
[57:47] so we ought to be rejoicing
[57:50] i'm still complaining
[57:53] because it could be that we could be
[57:54] laying in the bed somewhere paralyzed
[57:56] right
[57:57] he said because we've all got a test for
[57:59] a try
[58:04] but his test in a trial means that we're
[58:06] not his wife
[58:10] no
[58:11] he's teaching us the nature right right
[58:13] he's building in us what we need right a
[58:15] nature
[58:17] away
[58:19] what do you understand i think i've got
[58:20] my point across so
[58:22] you know
[58:25] see a divorce is the reversal
[58:27] of the vows of when you asked the girl
[58:31] and she accepted your proposal
[58:37] so then you just turned around and took
[58:38] away your bible
[58:40] now as christians we vowed
[58:44] to live
[58:46] holy and righteous in god right amen
[58:49] do the best we can to try to
[58:52] live right
[58:55] but then we go out and live like the
[58:57] devil then we find out her husband's
[58:58] still alive
[59:00] but around the invisible union said
[59:01] don't don't think about divorcing him
[59:03] now that's because you can't hang him up
[59:05] in a closet that's right
[59:08] and that's what a lot of people want
[59:09] right
[59:11] yeah
[59:13] and a lot of people today they just
[59:14] divorce to where they can and buy legal
[59:17] paperwork they go down in divorce
[59:19] and they get it to work that they can
[59:21] still live in the same house and be okie
[59:23] don't keep it to get better income tax
[59:26] right yeah
[59:30] you do better by being single than you
[59:32] can by being married a lot of times or
[59:33] something
[59:36] that's how easy it is to understand or
[59:40] to just go get a divorce right
[59:43] it's become a sloppy thing all right
[59:45] amen
[59:46] you know a divorcing if if joseph had a
[59:49] divorce mary do you know they would have
[59:52] killed her
[59:58] we prove to the bible if she finds
[1:00:00] someone the man finds some uncleanness
[1:00:03] in her deuteronomy 24.
[1:00:07] he could kill her or put her out of the
[1:00:09] house
[1:00:14] he was put away
[1:00:18] brother brown said he can put us away
[1:00:20] right
[1:00:22] marriage in divorce every twitches
[1:00:24] but he said we can't put him
[1:00:26] away amen and we'll get to it this
[1:00:29] evening that there is no grounds no
[1:00:32] thoughts no ideas no point to think
[1:00:34] about it and no no need to try to visit
[1:00:37] brotherdale in the office to explain
[1:00:39] something
[1:00:40] there is no grounds for a divorce for a
[1:00:42] woman nope
[1:00:43] that's right
[1:00:45] nowhere in the bible and nowhere in the
[1:00:47] prophet's ministry that's right
[1:00:49] can a woman divorce her husband
[1:00:53] now you can argue with me flesh women
[1:00:54] hey i'm just going to hold the paper up
[1:00:56] and say well i said it no i mean that's
[1:00:57] it
[1:01:00] but it's not said for him
[1:01:05] oh boy you are a male children this pig
[1:01:07] ever what that word than you
[1:01:18] you know that brother brown said adam
[1:01:20] that eve should have been burned you
[1:01:22] want that quote you should have been
[1:01:24] burned for what you've done
[1:01:28] but aren't you glad she wouldn't
[1:01:33] i would be here
[1:01:36] the adam took her back
[1:01:39] that's what i said about the old
[1:01:40] testament when you're reading in the old
[1:01:42] testament read real careful you'll find
[1:01:44] that god putting away israel when they
[1:01:46] go down into babylon
[1:01:48] but then you'll find him 400 years later
[1:01:50] bringing in that bringing her out as his
[1:01:52] bride that's right yep right maybe a few
[1:01:55] years later she put back in bondage
[1:01:57] again
[1:01:57] put away
[1:01:59] god away from it but then a few chapters
[1:02:00] later she's coming right back
[1:02:02] right now that grace of marriage and
[1:02:04] divorce your prophet knew it as you go
[1:02:07] into 1964 questions and answers before
[1:02:10] the
[1:02:10] marriage and divorce was preached in 65
[1:02:13] in 64 he said
[1:02:15] if you'll believe me as a prophet remain
[1:02:17] as you are
[1:02:21] don't go do anything until you hear from
[1:02:23] me
[1:02:27] he knew there would be a grace given
[1:02:29] but he couldn't walk out there and say
[1:02:32] okay
[1:02:33] that's right why because god had not
[1:02:36] said it yet right
[1:02:38] man he had only spoke of it in times and
[1:02:41] shadows right right
[1:02:42] and speaking of something is not the
[1:02:45] the point of bringing it into reality
[1:02:47] that's right
[1:02:50] brother brown knew paul had a grace of
[1:02:51] marriage and divorce he knew that that
[1:02:53] moses had a grace
[1:02:56] and he believed there would be one in
[1:02:57] the end time but he couldn't bring it
[1:02:59] right until god said it
[1:03:02] because he had to have thus saith the
[1:03:04] lord that's right and he said because of
[1:03:06] the opening of the seven seals a
[1:03:09] supernatural revelation because of that
[1:03:12] so he didn't come out before the seals
[1:03:13] broke and told you about marriage and
[1:03:15] divorce but he did just simply put it in
[1:03:17] there if you'll read it
[1:03:19] he said
[1:03:20] don't do anything until you hear from me
[1:03:28] see then
[1:03:29] the new birth does have a lot to do
[1:03:31] with our lives yes
[1:03:34] because it keeps us from being destroyed
[1:03:37] right
[1:03:38] and it is only we gave it to her the
[1:03:40] other day and just hit the end of the
[1:03:41] message it is the earnest of our
[1:03:42] inheritance
[1:03:45] until the redemption of the purchase
[1:03:47] product but it's already redeemed plus
[1:03:49] or what you mean brother you don't
[1:03:50] understand it already
[1:03:52] you don't understand either keep reading
[1:03:54] the prophet said it's redeemed but said
[1:03:55] he ain't claiming that yet
[1:03:58] do you want that
[1:04:00] see we can quote
[1:04:03] but can we quote at all
[1:04:07] said he hadn't claimed it yet said he
[1:04:08] hadn't took possession yet
[1:04:12] that's why we're married to him by our
[1:04:14] vows but we're going to a wedding in the
[1:04:17] sky
[1:04:23] that's why you and i were married when
[1:04:25] we made our vows to the
[1:04:29] that's what i've told you i don't
[1:04:30] understand it
[1:04:32] i'm not trying to be nothing they never
[1:04:33] tried to be nothing anyway but i would
[1:04:35] not marry my wife until i told her my
[1:04:37] life
[1:04:40] boys girls you better listen to that
[1:04:43] right talk things over before you get
[1:04:45] married
[1:04:47] saves you a lot of trouble after you get
[1:04:48] married
[1:04:52] amen i would not ask her to marry me and
[1:04:55] was riding up the road going up into the
[1:04:57] mountains one day i said i want to tell
[1:04:58] you my life
[1:05:03] maybe that was god dealing with this old
[1:05:05] man back there as a sinner
[1:05:08] to try to keep him straight in a lot of
[1:05:10] ways and i wouldn't listen to him
[1:05:13] how many of you can say that that's
[1:05:14] right
[1:05:17] and i wasn't born again the ladder i
[1:05:18] come in this message right
[1:05:24] you see this message is what set me free
[1:05:29] whether it be grace of marriage and
[1:05:30] divorce or whether it be
[1:05:33] natural or spiritual or whatever it
[1:05:34] means
[1:05:36] you've got to accept it right that's
[1:05:38] right
[1:05:44] we'll go sometimes come in the office
[1:05:46] i'll be glad to sit down with you
[1:05:48] and we'll just use that 6 30 and let you
[1:05:50] click on it
[1:05:52] for the new testament word for divorce
[1:05:55] it basically comes down to being put
[1:05:57] away
[1:05:59] but look at the many many many hundreds
[1:06:02] of times it's used in the scripture
[1:06:04] that has that same basic meaning behind
[1:06:07] it
[1:06:08] right
[1:06:09] see we just play with words
[1:06:11] you saw i put her away but i didn't
[1:06:13] divorce her
[1:06:14] you ain't got enough sense to come in
[1:06:16] out of the ring rain
[1:06:19] sorry
[1:06:20] that's true
[1:06:25] and we're going to get into the
[1:06:26] scriptures we're going to go down
[1:06:27] through the scriptures when i say write
[1:06:29] down your questions write down your
[1:06:31] thoughts why does it say this
[1:06:37] and we will try to cover it see why it
[1:06:38] says it that way because you know the
[1:06:40] bible says exactly
[1:06:45] the bible says it's exactly right that's
[1:06:48] right that's what i like about it
[1:06:50] one scripture will quit
[1:06:53] thank you for everyone
[1:07:02] matthew 5 31 we read 32
[1:07:05] it has been said whosoever shall put
[1:07:07] away his wife
[1:07:13] giving glasses
[1:07:15] let him give her a writing of
[1:07:17] divorcement
[1:07:18] but i say unto you that whosoever shall
[1:07:20] put away his wife saving for the cause
[1:07:22] of fornication causes her to commit
[1:07:25] adultery and whosoever marry shall marry
[1:07:28] her
[1:07:29] that is divorced committed to adultery
[1:07:32] that's exactly right amen
[1:07:35] that's scripture
[1:07:40] there's no playing with the scriptures
[1:07:44] then we have to have a grace to be given
[1:07:47] i don't want anybody to stay lost in the
[1:07:50] wording and say well there's no hopes
[1:07:52] for me
[1:07:54] what are you doing here if there's no
[1:07:55] hope for you
[1:07:57] you're trying to find truth ain't you
[1:07:58] all right amen the truth shall set you
[1:08:01] free
[1:08:06] see then we're searching for truth
[1:08:09] this message is true
[1:08:13] i said something to a man one time about
[1:08:15] something like that and he said he went
[1:08:17] after what everybody said brother dale
[1:08:18] said i wasn't even a christian wouldn't
[1:08:19] say i didn't say that
[1:08:24] i said if you act like that
[1:08:26] then you're not saved that's exactly
[1:08:28] what i'm saying
[1:08:29] and i won't back up right if i act like
[1:08:32] that
[1:08:33] really i'm just the devil you know right
[1:08:36] that's simple
[1:08:41] but you see what i'm trying to get is to
[1:08:42] the point like i told a brother one time
[1:08:44] i said
[1:08:45] talking about a certain place i said
[1:08:47] anywhere in the world needs to be
[1:08:48] married in divorce that need to be
[1:08:49] preached
[1:08:52] i can count the names and look down
[1:08:53] through there and figure out this person
[1:08:55] this woman's got about four different
[1:08:56] kids but four different husbands you
[1:08:58] know but i figure somebody needs a grace
[1:09:00] well you know what
[1:09:02] and i'll restate it
[1:09:05] if that's not preached to where you can
[1:09:07] accept it
[1:09:08] how can it be done right
[1:09:12] that's right
[1:09:14] that's good you shall know the truth and
[1:09:16] the truth will set you free that's right
[1:09:18] but if you don't know the truth then go
[1:09:19] do what the truth says
[1:09:22] that's why i said and i said this 30
[1:09:24] almost 40 years ago
[1:09:26] i said according the way i understand
[1:09:29] most of the people that follow this
[1:09:30] message are going to die and go by the
[1:09:32] grave and i may be the number one guy
[1:09:35] that i was talking about that's all
[1:09:37] right
[1:09:38] but i'm telling the truth that's not
[1:09:39] de-christianizing nobody that's right
[1:09:42] because to die and go by the grave
[1:09:45] sister cletus said if i go by the grave
[1:09:47] i get to beat you up i remember that
[1:09:48] about 40 years ago he said i'll beat you
[1:09:51] up because the dead and christ should
[1:09:53] rise first
[1:09:56] but listen
[1:10:00] if you don't know
[1:10:03] that you need to be saved how can you be
[1:10:05] saved
[1:10:07] if you don't know you need to grace the
[1:10:09] marriage and divorce how are you going
[1:10:10] to check
[1:10:13] are you going to get there and claim
[1:10:15] stupidity and not know where or what the
[1:10:17] word would be used
[1:10:19] you know
[1:10:23] no we can't play that
[1:10:26] i didn't say that the biggest portion of
[1:10:28] people of this mess is going gonna die
[1:10:29] and go to hell now you misinterpreted
[1:10:31] what i said
[1:10:32] i said they're gonna go by the grave and
[1:10:34] i may be one of them and everybody i'm
[1:10:36] looking at may be one of them
[1:10:39] but it's because we haven't accepted the
[1:10:41] message to set us free right to work
[1:10:44] because that bride is standing there for
[1:10:45] that change in a moment a twinkle of an
[1:10:47] eye
[1:10:48] is going to be a world born bride
[1:10:51] there won't be no denominational husband
[1:10:53] to be dealing with when that comes along
[1:10:57] there won't be no imagine divorce
[1:10:58] problems
[1:11:00] that's right
[1:11:02] yes sir you want a quote fart
[1:11:05] i'll give it this afternoon
[1:11:08] they asked brother brown a question
[1:11:12] said can double married people go into
[1:11:14] rapture
[1:11:21] look at it this afternoon
[1:11:24] you know what his answer was
[1:11:27] i don't know
[1:11:36] but we believe a prophet we don't
[1:11:38] believe that quote
[1:11:40] yeah
[1:11:43] that was what he said
[1:11:46] laid on my desk if you're going to read
[1:11:47] it when you go by
[1:11:52] they asked him the question can people
[1:11:54] have a husband and a living wife
[1:11:56] can they go in the rapture
[1:11:58] he said i don't know
[1:12:03] you know
[1:12:04] maybe after 40 years i found what he
[1:12:07] said
[1:12:09] because of what i tried to say 40 years
[1:12:11] ago
[1:12:12] i never tried to scare nobody it's not
[1:12:14] you know yourself i don't try to scare
[1:12:16] these kids into salvation you can't work
[1:12:18] it that way
[1:12:19] i never tried to scare anybody into
[1:12:22] believing the message or to doing any
[1:12:24] certain thing i've always tried to
[1:12:25] preach the truth
[1:12:30] let the truth set us free
[1:12:36] because you can't make these kids get
[1:12:37] saved
[1:12:43] but you can put christ out there
[1:12:45] let them see christ
[1:12:47] and let them see the life that you live
[1:12:50] amen and that can lead them to christ a
[1:12:51] whole lot more than all the sermons
[1:12:54] brother dale can bring to the pool
[1:12:59] you let them see christ in you
[1:13:03] take on these things what is a marriage
[1:13:07] can you make your bibles what is a
[1:13:08] divorce
[1:13:10] to say i do not want these vows to be
[1:13:13] of any truth anymore
[1:13:16] i want to disassociate myself from that
[1:13:18] person
[1:13:24] that's why i said
[1:13:25] you better go check it out
[1:13:28] because you see if you didn't go down
[1:13:29] there and say i want to disassociate
[1:13:31] myself
[1:13:32] you might find out that there's still
[1:13:34] some legal binding
[1:13:41] you better know them that's right
[1:13:43] all right
[1:13:44] okay
[1:13:45] think what you want to about brother
[1:13:47] dale but is it the truth that's right
[1:13:50] that's all it says
[1:13:52] is it the truth
[1:13:54] you don't understand me in my case
[1:13:57] if i didn't know we had a case
[1:14:00] right i thought where we messed up in
[1:14:02] the garden was where eve wanted a case
[1:14:04] to be done
[1:14:05] i think
[1:14:07] is that what the prophet said she said i
[1:14:09] think
[1:14:10] she was making her own case
[1:14:12] right
[1:14:14] but you see there is a truth that'll set
[1:14:16] us free
[1:14:17] there's going to be a bride that's going
[1:14:18] to walk off this earth that's right
[1:14:24] and i want to be part of that don't you
[1:14:28] that's fine with me no problem but i
[1:14:30] want to be here to see the children
[1:14:32] amen
[1:14:34] i want to be here to see that change the
[1:14:36] moment
[1:14:39] and i'll know for certain it's all in
[1:14:43] grace
[1:14:44] number 94 inspiring
[1:14:47] anybody
[1:15:02] foreign
[1:15:21] i am
[1:15:45] me
[1:15:58] glorious
[1:16:07] me
[1:16:34] there will be
[1:16:48] is
[1:17:20] know
[1:17:39] some of you
[1:17:40] i know how the mind works
[1:17:44] and you can be standing looking at
[1:17:45] somebody and they can be telling you
[1:17:47] something you don't even hear it
[1:17:54] now brother branham they asked him the
[1:17:55] question
[1:18:00] could people double married going to
[1:18:02] rapture
[1:18:03] he said i don't know
[1:18:07] that was before the grace of marriage
[1:18:09] and divorce was preached
[1:18:14] but now listen folks why can't we be
[1:18:16] honest
[1:18:19] if i could not receive the grace of
[1:18:20] marriage indoors
[1:18:23] but yet realized
[1:18:27] that jesus christ has set my soul free
[1:18:30] and that i would have to go by the grave
[1:18:32] so what
[1:18:34] i'm happy amen
[1:18:37] i got away
[1:18:42] he's malay he's the one who take care of
[1:18:45] it that's right man that's right it
[1:18:47] shouldn't be that we'd say well i don't
[1:18:49] know
[1:18:50] whether i make it
[1:18:52] he's already made it the new earth will
[1:18:54] make sure that we go in the rapture yes
[1:18:58] but we may have to go by the grave and
[1:19:00] come out to god
[1:19:02] no problem
[1:19:05] no problem
[1:19:18] can you say well are you going to accept
[1:19:19] the secondary no no no i ain't accepting
[1:19:22] no secondary
[1:19:24] i'm saying
[1:19:25] that i want to be one of them but if i
[1:19:28] have to go the other way that's god's
[1:19:29] way of doing it
[1:19:31] it's not whether or not i accept it
[1:19:34] it's whether or not he accepts me
[1:19:37] no it's all settled in him
[1:19:39] make sure you don't misunderstand
[1:19:41] because i've had people to accuse me of
[1:19:42] saying things
[1:19:45] that i never said a word of it
[1:19:50] i had no intention to say things like
[1:19:52] that
[1:19:53] but yet they've accused me of saying it
[1:19:55] will come bring the tape let me hear it
[1:19:58] if i say it i'll be glad to apologize
[1:20:01] i'll be glad to tell the world on the
[1:20:02] internet to sex service
[1:20:04] that i was wrong
[1:20:10] but you see
