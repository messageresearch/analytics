control he has a will for each of our lives and we just put our shoulder with all the other believers and just keep each other in prayer that's the main thing put each other pick somebody and put them as a burden on your heart and just keep that person continuously in prayer amen open the eyes of my heart lord open the eyes of my want to heart you oh jesus i want to see you open the eyes of [Music]

[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] amen good to be in the house with lord it's good and warm in this house today but you know what we're trying to escape a hotter place yeah ma'am i want to the only announcement i have at the moment is at the moment they're trying to fix the uh they're trying to fix the air conditioner aaron says if he can get a um a motor then it'll be here before a second service so we'll have second service but we're just gonna have to just hang around and see what's going on uh there's a shower today and um some things going like that so we need to really pray that that thing will get fixed pray that the lord has sent us he did send us a good cool breeze a minute to go through the door and we appreciate that we appreciate all of you we want to uh pray for brother royale today as we stand here we just gotta update that he was doing good or better today than he looked gooder than he was yesterday so uh we pray that he will be uh uh not have to go on that ventilator amen and the power of god will amen the power of god's better than anything we got the power of god i was praying last night i said lord we're your bride we're not just some outcast we're not somebody that's that's just floundering around in the world we're trying our best to get through this thing and and in our humanity we're lost i mean in our human you understand your human body is still part of the curse part of the fall but that thing inside of you is greater greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world and thank you for praying for me i don't know what happened last couple days but my blood pressure has never ever bothered me in my entire life ever i it's been 117 over 70 for 60 years well count not counting the baby years but uh it went to like 190 over 110 and it's been fluctuating back and forth so i spent about six hours in the emergency room uh friday and they did ekg they did cat scan found a brain and found a heart so for those of you that think i'm heartless and brainless then again then again yesterday morning i kept feeling bad i've never had this feeling of high blood pressure so i went back yesterday and went to the um the guys down at the fire station we owed them some honey so we took them anyway my blood pressure was 190 over 100 so he said you probably need to go back so i went to quick care and it went down to 135 over 78 or 87 and did another ekg and he said it's not your heart so you just pray that god will take this thing out and no sarah your your dream is not coming to pass she said she dreamed she had to get me cpr so that's not going to happen that was just something you were thinking but you just keep it keep my heart in your prayer all right and we'll get through this i know it's hot if you want to go downstairs you may go down there where the air conditioner is working or you can just uh bear with us for a little while but we want to turn to hebrews 9 and start there but just keep us in your prayer i'm going to go see my primary physician we do need doctors we still believe in physicians we believe in doctors because of this outside man that we have to live in but that inside man is going to have to speak and say this is enough to the bride of jesus christ that's like i told brother royal i sent him a message i said man keep on fighting fight fight till the last breath fight till you can't fight no more because you know what this fight's not over with we've got to pick this thing up and go to the coming of the lord amen so let's go to hebrews 9 11 and go back to eternal redemption and let's bow our heads the heavenly father thank you lord for this day for the hour and the day you've given us the time lord i pray that that air conditioner number one will be fixed so the people will be feel more pleasant inside but father i pray that the holy ghost will make us feel much more pleasant in the inner man lord as we continue to preach a word lord and we continue lord the people to pull on the gift father we pray that that will take over today and your name will be magnified your day will be glorified and everything that we do today will do for your honor and glory father be with the ones that are sick the ones that are not with us lord be your brother royal and the different ones there's chichi the ones the different ones in the bride that we know that is affecting churches now pretty bad so we pray lord you're protecting power for each one father just keep our pastor safe and be with him and bless him father and bless each day that we live we'll give you all the praise and honor and glory in jesus name amen but christ being coming high priests are good things to come by greater more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered into once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us amos 3 verse 7 says surely the lord will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets the lion hath roared who will not fear the lord has spoken who can but prophesy and we had a prophet come in the end time we know that to tell us these things and thank god for that prophet revelations 11 3 and i will give power to my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred three score days clothed in sackcloth you may be seated in the warhead and it's blessing now we'll run through this pretty quick and not hold you alone because if you'll just keep pulling those up we'll just keep reading them in matthew 17 verse 10 they asked him and said well what's going to happen when is all these things when is all this end time going to happen remember the three questions that claude was talking about this past sunday boy i got a lot i i smart as i am i got a lot on that sixth sale that i had not seen before and i really enjoyed that maybe i'll be able to convey a little bit of that more to you later on and jesus answered and said he lies truly shall first come and restore all things and we know that malachi 4 was our restoring prophet he came to restore all things make all things come up to the standard that it was even in the in the younger days or down when the paul and irenaeus and all the different ones he turned our heart back because during the church ages what happened man got involved man got involved and man said this and man said that took us completely away from the bible give us purgatories and give us things that's not even you know virgin mary that's the mother of god and boy just and then all the way up into the denominations where they took us to another baptism they took us to a three god system you see what they've done to us they took us through all that but now god said i will restore according to joel and according to malachi 4 i will restore saith the lord and we know that that he restored us back not only back to the faith of the fathers not only back to the old testament not old testament the old prophets but he restored us back and give us a message to change our body and i want you to realize that that message was given to change our body what brother claude was talking about the seals and the different things has been opened up i've read a commentary from um dr schofield that's not in his bible he wrote a commentary on on prophets and he hit the nail on the head i mean he told him exactly what we needed a prophet we need not a prophet but we needed the prophets to bring us the word of the lord to bring us back to what back to god read all the old testament saints i'm in jeremiah now reading in the morning in the book of jeremiah and he tells jeremiah go tell them go tell those people what they're doing wrong and tell them to turn back but you know what happened in about the 23rd chapter of jeremiah they rose up to kill him they hated him so much because of what he said they wanted to kill him so you see what that does with us that same spirit's here now it's raised up to try to kill you and me kill our influence not just kill ourselves kill our influence all right so now let's go to luke 17 30. because in the days of the son of man these things will be made known all right let's go to the chart real quick and then we'll go to luke 17 30. i won't read that one on the feast of the trumpets if you'll pull up the chart for us just real quick y'all pray for aaron that he'll get that done and everything will be fixed and we'll hear it go [Music] and we'll feel it cool and you know what i like what scofield says scofield he was talking about god returning to israel and that's what we're going to get into is that these seven church ages right here in daniel 70 weeks it's quotation marks gentiles were inserted 69 weeks were finished they put christ on the cross after the 62nd week right and then we have a parenthesis which is the gentile church but that gentile church got so bad see the white white white black black black the black is darkness the white is light and as someone was preaching the other night you know brother branham is the one that filled that in and gave a little bit of light and that's me and you if not it would be total blackness why but not blackness of death but blackness of what kills you more than anything your doctrine will kill you more than anything well all right so the bride in the seven church ages and i know that's whistling but you know what it's just gonna have to whistle because i like that fan that's why i'm standing right here but that church age is the question mark or quotation mark and then god's going to start dealing with the jews after the rapture of the church is that right and we know that there has to come a resurrection first i'm kind of skipping through a lot of this first thessalonians dead in christ shall rise first first corinthians we shall not sleep but we shall be changed in a moment in the twentieth of an hour we know that we've been through that revelations 4 1. if y'all want to find that that's fine or you can actually just listen just leave it right there and head toward the tribulation period over time bring it over this way a little bit if you bring it over this way i'll continue reading because we've already read these quotes and to save time revelations 4 1 listen we know revelations 4 1 we as the bride go up so we're going up right here we're going up we know that we're going to have a resurrection 40 days we're going to be around here and then we're going in a rapture excuse me and that's only to the born-again believers right not anybody else not the church the church has to go through the tribulation so now matthew 24 21 we're looking right here we know what's holding off the tribulation me and you we're holding off the wrath of god and i like what dr schofield said he was talking about this tribulation he said look now this is in 19 early 1900s when schofield was alive he said he said you know he said back then he said when when adam fell when adam and eve fell god in 2000 years later god destroyed the whole world because it was a lawless nobody had the holy ghost it was a lawless generation that had been raised up and they were doing what they wanted to do mary given him marriage and brother brown said just like this age all right so he's doing that so what god do he destroyed it amen so that's what he's going to do now he's going to destroy once the once god takes the holy ghost off the earth the lawlessness of man is going to you think what happened with you you think what happened with the six and a half million jews toothache compared to what's going to happen man's going to have pent up anger the nations are going to have anger against each other that's only being held off because me and you're still here only being held off because we're still here amen so then when we go in the rapture there'll be no holy ghost except for what god going to the jews and then he promised he would protect them amen he promised he would protect them because in matthew 17 now we see that it's moses and elijah but in revelations 11 verse 3 and i will give power to my two witnesses and they'll prophesy a thousand two hundred three score days clothed in sackcloth these are the two law of the trees so what are they going to do right here they're going to bring two prophets on the scene according to revelation 4 1 we go in the rapture the bride goes up two prophets revelations 11 and it's a three and a half year message to the jews but it does begin the tribulation period when me and you leave when you and i leave this place the tribulation is going to happen it will start over here in the gentile nations because remember god has been dealing with the gentiles during that period of time but when that period of time is closed up and the bride's gone only israel then everything that god's promised in jeremiah isaiah ezekiel and all the different things god's going to actually turn to the jews pull the wall off of their eyes or pull his hand away from their eyes and he's going to start dealing with them exclusively i said exclusively no more gentiles will be saved exclusively he'll be dealing with the now listen the fifth sealed jew of course they're sealed away it's already done then we got a jew that's coming up 144 000. then you've got you've got a foolish virgin and you've got a cup of water in my name that's going to have to go through that tribulation period they're going to have to go through it because they didn't receive the holy ghost because see when the holy ghost leaves the person's going with it the person that's got the holy ghost is going to leave with it amen so if you don't have the holy ghost you have nothing to pull you up it's like brother claude said you're not sealed we got to get sealed down here now the 144 000 they're going to get sealed in the three and a half years of tribulation of the preaching of the two witnesses right they're going to get sealed and get the holy ghost but see the whole rest of the world is not going to be even the even the 10 the virgins they're not going to get the holy ghost they're going to come up with white throne judgment and god's gonna say hey you stood for me i'll stand for you and they'll be what they'll give an account of what they've done and then they'll be judged by that but they were foolish virgins they were virgins all right so now daniel 9 24 tells us and and just hold it right there 70 weeks are determined so the 70 weeks remember it started over here went through the old testament come to jesus then there was that parentheses gap to right here then there's one week left that 69 weeks has already passed there's one week left after the rapture of the church to finish daniel 70 weeks not to not to preach seven years not to have a a full seven year tribulation but it will be a it'll take seven years to transpire all these things of building listen there's got to be a millennium temple belt there's got to be a battle of armageddon that it's not going to be a one-day battle folks it may take a year to kill everybody off the earth but it's going to be an atomic battle atomic explosion and people are going to die because that's when the bible tells us and i hate this but that's what the bible tells us that you'll be standing there and your your flesh will fall off your bone while you're still alive we think we got problems now think about that day think about that time when you call for the rocks and they to fall on you and people that have billions of dollars and they built these big bunkers down in the in the ground and they built this they want to go fly out into space they're not going to make it they're just not going to make it you wish you could go and say look buddy get the new birth there's the ark that you need there's the bunker that you need there's the airplane that you need there's the flying to mars or wherever they want to go that's what you need it's priceless yet you can't buy it priceless but you can't buy thank god for the holy ghost then brother brown tells us in number three just leave that right there because we're going to get to something that moses and elijah will appear and preach jesus christ and the holy spirit took from the gentiles and the rapture comes for the church to be taken up and the jews that's left here will be preached for three and a half years and then the gentiles will be given a place not to repent but they'll be given a place like you got your foot like i said there will be gentiles on the earth that will be given eternal life but not during the tribulation period they'll have to be given they even got to wait past the thousand years that's right because remember only a thousand years is going to be the bride and 144 000. and whatever you want to say about the heathen that comes up i don't understand all that but i know one thing's for sure god promised david he'd have a son sitting on the throne for a thousand years judging the 12 tribes of israel and the gentile bride is going to be sitting there with them with him judging them for a honeymoon and that's us but now what's going to happen down here when we're gone let's back up just a minute revelations 9 27 in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease for the overspreading of abomination he shall make it desolate they're going to make somebody real mad at the end of that three and a half years at the end of this three and a half years right here we see right here there'll be a three and a half years to the jews and then there's three and a half more years but that three and a half more years won't be any preaching it'll be the battle of armageddon and the purging of the earth and then the jews have got to come back and build a millennial temple all right so they got to build a temple while they're here and while we're still enjoying you say well we're only going to be on a honeymoon three and a half years i've done said before show me that in the bible it only says the married shepherd of the lamb brother branham says we'll be uh enjoying enjoying a three and a half year marriage supper but there's no bible for that listen we're in eternity so it really doesn't matter but to fulfill daniel 70 weeks there's got to have be time here on the earth two witnesses are going to be killed in the middle of this week according to the bible according to revelations 11 says when they shall have finished their testimony the beast that ascended out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and overcome them and kill them all right and it's gonna they're gonna kill the 144 thousand their bodies are going to lay in the street three and a half days they'll horrible but guess what's going to happen the whole world's going to see them rise because there's another resurrection amen the jews will have a resurrection it'll bring them up out of the ground and they will ascend up to heaven according to verse 12 in a cloud and their enemies beheld them what a great day but remember the world as the gentile world knows they've been going through tribulation way before then but now when now 144 000 leaves with the two witnesses the bible says immediately there's an earthquake immediately there's all these things that are going to happen why because somebody's going to get mad and somebody's going to start dropping bombs and man so there's there's going to be all kind of chaos battle of armageddon will be coming to full force then because listen battleborn beginning don't start when we leave right right that's tribulation period they'll be hunted down and they'll be persecuted i'm talking about the the foolish version and different ones but that's not the battle worm again the battle of armageddon's not going to happen until 144 000 are gone they gotta leave and get out of here all right so because listen they can't be anybody on earth with the holy ghost because that's the wrath of god poured out on the unregenerated so the unregenerated don't have the holy ghost so they're the ones that's going to have to go through this tribulation period and this battle of armageddon when they just start pushing buttons and they just kill as many people as they can let's read this let's go to quote number five and read what the prophet said i like this everybody all right sweating real good okay all right we won't be very long i'm gonna try to cut this short if we have a second service i'm gonna let brother bob speak and then i may just continue wednesday night that's all right hey man we'll see according to what they're doing they're working out here now diligently so if you'll find quote number five for me please [Music] there we go now when he gets the money now who's he this is the antichrist like all right we're in the middle of that last week the prophets the prophets have already finished they're prophesying they've brought in 144 thousand they've all come in they're sealed now when he gets the money all under control then he will break this covenant with the jews now look he's not going to break the covenant with the 144 thousand he never made one with them and they never made one with him right so he ain't talking about the 144 thousand of the two witnesses all right he's talking about natural israel that's trying to get the temple built that's trying to get all these things back together the menorah and the ark of the covenant and all these different things as daniel said he would do in the midst of the last half of the 70 weeks of daniel that's that last week and then brother what will he do he will have all the world trade look how much they got of it now they'll have all of it because you know what all the gates and all the different ones with the millions and billions they're going to see that this guy's for real he's got power remember he had he gets power to act like god right so he's gonna be combative with those two witnesses but one he's gonna kill him because of the prophecy of three and a half years right so after that three and a half years over there's no more prophecy to keep the two witnesses alive so he kills them then he raises up and says hey i'm god that's my temple this is my city and i'm your god but now remember what the bible says then god comes down and fights for his people see then brother what will we do we will have all the world he will have the world trade and the commerce a pact with the world because he will hold the wealth of the world completely and during that time them two prophets will rise on the scene and call that 144 thousand then what will take place then the mark of the beast of revelations 13 will set in now remember we know it sets in now because it's a mark in your forehead it's it's your ideas it's it's it's the devil inside your brain all right but now look he's going to he's got a head up see he's got to start as a baby and he's got to head up somewhere so he's going to head up right here the mark of the beast will come in that no man can buy or sell except him that has the mark of the beast thank god the church will be enjoying a great three and a half years in glory don't have to go through that like i said before ain't not a great revelation you don't have to deal with that guy he's not going to deceive you but everyone that is deceived will follow that guy everybody right with that all right now let's go to um i'll say let's go back to the chart but let's no let's read these two read revelations 19 6 and then we'll go back to the chart i want to show you something here and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude the voice of many waters now i skipped over a little bit because you're talking about the battle arm again but i want to show you this this is where we land anybody okay with that i want to show you where we land because you know we're somewhere for that time we're somewhere doesn't matter where we're somewhere doing something else it wouldn't matter if we did come back into this dimension we got glorified bodies we're eternal body spirit and soul what does it matter and i heard it worth a voice of great multitude the voice of many waters is the voice of mighty thunderings saying hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen which is what the righteousness of saints and he said unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb so look like i skipped this one but let's get back to it that's the only real reference that you have of a marriage supper of the lamb it doesn't say three and a half years right but we're gonna what what the whole emphasis is is we're going somewhere to eat at a table with abraham isaac jacob joseph all the different ones a marriage supper of the lamb we're going to sit there well maybe not with them that'll be later on but it'll be just the bride and then that's where the bible says he'll wipe all the tears from our eyes all the former things will pass away what's going to happen in that you say well we've got glorified bodies why would we be crying we're glorified we can cry whenever we want to but it's tears of joy not tears of sadness amen amen you think when you see jesus you're going to be all dry eyed i don't think so i i don't think so but call but they blessed are they which are calling to the matter supper of the lamb and he said unto them look these are the true sayings of god now we're going to get to the battle of armageddon now that's us in the mad supper up here in another dimension now revelation 16 13. and i saw three unclean spirits like frogs but it's kind of strange how brother brown tells us about this how would you know come on how would you know that three unclean spirits like frogs would be a trinitarian doctrine how many of y'all figured that out before you heard it from the prophet that's why god sends us prophets because how could you figure that out came out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth now who did you know who the dragon was who did you know who the beast was who do you know who the false prophet was but brother brown laid it right out for us told us that they are spirits of devils he said that was that trinitarian doctrine that come from the pits of hell amen for they are spirits of devils working miracles which go forth unto the kings of the earth the whole world to gather them together what did i just say he gathers all the wealth he's got all the commerce the people can't buy or sell they got to come to him kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them to the battle of that great day of god almighty behold i come as a thief blessed is he that watcheth and keeps his garment unless he walked naked and they see his shame and he gathered them together into a place called in the hebrew tongue armageddon now dad's been there before to the valley of megiddo and it's just a big old valley but that's where it's going to end at and that's where they're going to start now listen it won't be that everybody in the world is going to be in that valley but something's going to start in that valley something's going to start in that valley and it's going to go all over the whole world i don't know whether it's going to be the the beast is going to walk down there with the because remember you got 10 kingdoms that pop up during this time and they worship him the beast so you got all that and what is that that's kingdoms according to daniel so you got to have heads of kingdoms what if they had some kind of meeting down in the valley of megiddo and all of a sudden somebody drops a bomb on them well then everybody else is going to start dropping bombs on everybody else all right so it's not going to be while that battle arm again is going to be right there in that one come on that battle of armageddon is worldwide it's going to start there then it's going to go worldwide look at the communication today versus then but we know god knew that communications would instantly as soon as the bomb goes off listen everybody in the world

words there will be no more people saved 144 000 two witnesses they're gone and there were voices and thunders and lightning there was a great earthquake such as not sense men upon the earth so mighty an earthquake and so great so the earthquake is going to start and the great city was divided into three parts the cities of the nations fell great babylon came in remembrance before god now who is

the people but it will not be bride it will not be bride it will not be anyone that's sealed with the holy ghost it will be the people that got a chance and turned it down so it's all up to them and it's all up to us today and there fell upon a man of great hell out of heaven every stone that weighed a talent men blasphemed god because of the plagues of the hell for the plague thereof was exceeding great wow not just great exceeding great let's look at victory day number six the next one please we talk about we've had several wars wars and rumors of wars and v-days and v-days and v-days and it'll finally wind up to the great battle of armageddon that'll be the last of it when she comes to the battle of armageddon that'll settle the whole thing just before the great millennium armageddon is to clean off the earth she re-purifies herself with this atomic blowing and the volcanic ash and things sink this soaked blood of men and upon the earth in sin and crime she sinks beneath the earth and the volcanic braids out again and renews and cleans the earth for the great millennium he cleans his church during that time for a people to live here amen i say i like that yes there's coming a time when it will be great all right let's read ezekiel 40. we might everybody doing okay everybody's okay nobody i know if everybody's really sleepy now we gotta we got we got something for that wake up that's a real chauffeur so far it's a shofar with a trumpet end on it i told him i said we'll start blowing it if you're not asleep you'll start blowing it we all have we we're he's fine that's why he's sitting right here i'm glad he's here hey man all right so ezekiel now look so the battle of armageddon's happened we're not even going to we're not even going to describe that because the bible already describes it the birds will eat your flesh while you're still alive your skin's going to fall off your body why atomic atomic you're gonna they're gonna people die of starvation they're gonna die of all these different things horrible but we're not gonna be anywhere around there so we're gonna be in another dimension but now remember i'm not finished with revelations 19 because remember in the end of revelations 19 something happens we come back down here amen if you let me get to that then we'll then we'll finish and then brother bob can preach this afternoon in the five and twentieth year of our captivity in the beginning of the year and the tenth day of the month fourteenth year after that the city was smitten and the self same day the hand of the lord was upon me and brought me tether and in the visions of god brought he me into the land of israel now where is where are we going to spend our millennium new york city i hope not israel so we're going back to jerusalem the mother of us all now it's going to be the homeland for the jews but it's going to be the millennium temple which will be the honeymoon for me and you because listen we're not promised land we're promised the whole world we're promised the whole world we're not promised just a piece of land amen and the vision of god brought me into the land of israel and set me up on a very high mountain by which was as the frame of a city see as a front as a frame of the city on the south and he brought me there and behold there was a man whose appearance was like the appearance of brass what judgment and with a line of flax in his hand and a measuring reed and he stood in the gate brother gary they don't have a laser back then so they had to do it with a line they had to do it with a plummet they had they had to do it with the different things i've done that before yeah before you put the plumber down i've seen you know get a corner and get the point of the corner you kids are going what's he talking about all you gotta do is push a button and it'll tell us what to do well anyway these are measuring tools that was from way back in ezekiel's time okay with a line flax in his hand and a measuring reed and he stood in the gate and the man said unto me son of man behold with thine eyes and hear with thine ears and set thine heart upon all that i shall show thee for to the intent that i might show them unto thee art thou brought hither look declare all that thou see us to the bride oh that's not what that says we're not listen we got a city that's coming down from heaven made without hands this one is going to be made with hands and this one is going to be made by israel all right declare all that thou see us to the house of israel so this is to israel it is and listen you can read it i didn't bring it all but brother brown tells us from ezekiel 40 to 44. so you've got three other chapters that gives you the dimensions the rooms the where they're going to place this where they're going to place that now listen me and you have nothing to do with that because we're not promised that kind of a temple this is the temple that god wants in the gentile dispensation but he did tell seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and thy holy city which is jerusalem to rebuild that thing sure they built it by man by the way a long time ago but god's going to rebuild this millennial temple through the jews i believe just to me now this is just me i believe it'll be the 144 thousand it'll build a temple because it will not be me and you because from ezekiel 40 to 44 is the building of that temple so from 41 to 44 it's dimensions and listen i i don't want to be i don't want to be irreverent but it was all boring to me to read that because it's not to me but it means something to them every every i mean every square inch means something to a jew and god said hey i like that folks i'm going to let you build that temple and you're going to be in it but guess who is going to anoint that temple coming into the millennium me and you all right everybody got that all right so now look somebody's car's going off let's read the whole quote and then we'll let's not even 11 o'clock yet all right seven read number seven i am sweating up here it's a little bit i can't get that fan over here on this side let me pull it over here see who'd you set on the keys old forward yeah y'all forge there's a forward it's a ford yeah for period all right now 70 weeks of daniel let brother branham explain this and i tried to explain but let him explain this all right now these two prophets what will they do it's moses and elijah they'll rise on the scene they'll tell those jews their mistake and out of that jewish bunch they're now going to be 144 000 god will call these prophets what is it the spirit of elijah off this gentile church we'll just continue right on into that jewish church go right on in and call moses with him all right hallelujah you see it and he'll preach the same message that you're getting pentecostal message to them now remember they don't get they don't get um the son of man ministry so they don't have to know what the seals are listen they're they know what the seals are they read them i mean they're in the old testament but they understand their part of god coming down and doing the things because remember the two prophets of the sixth seal were those those those witnesses over there they know and they teach that to the people right they teach that to the 144 000 you missed it the old testament proved we're going to be standing here today that they rejected the messiah you see it will be the same pentecostal message that these jews will preach right over to them and they'll hate those jews who's they the other jews and they'll hate those jews so bad until they'll kill them and they were hated by all nations because it's going to spread out and in the midst of the week because they had raised up a great power for 144 thousand they had the holy ghost and brother you talk about doing miracles they did them they stopped the heavens it didn't rain smote the earth with plagues as often they wanted they give plagues and everything else they'll give them romans a hard way to go now he doesn't mean just rome he means the whole world all right but finally they'll be killed our god is a terrible god when he's angry but remember that's over in the 70th week and the church is in glory the wedding supper is going on yes now notice that's where we seen her coming back to the millennial temple over here at the end of the jewish age the anointed now what's the end of the jewish age not listen not when 144 000 take a rapture remember 70 weeks are determined we've only had 69 and a half once they're killed there's got to be a millennial temple because that's where the city's got to go to my people and the city so during that other three and a half years they're going to build a temple and see it look at the end of the jewish age now see we can't come back until their 70 weeks is over see that's according to god god can't come here and go to the jews until we're out of the way boom all right then he comes to them and gives him three and a half year ministry but that's not all of 70 weeks that's 69 and a half so he's got to take them out of the way wipe the earth off and then bring somebody back to build that temple then wherever we were we're going to be coming from wherever we were and we're going to land or anoint that temple so watch here he comes right on a white horse now look at the end of the jewish age those followed him on white horses horses powers dressed in white blood or vesture dripped in blood wrote on him the word of god he cometh to mighty conqueror to set up the millennium coming to the temple glory there he meets that hundred and forty four thousand sees with us then he meets the 144 thousand so let's read this let's go back and read revelations 19 11 it's before that i skipped that i'm sorry let's read that ebay all right okay revelations 19 11. and i saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he that said on him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he just judged and made war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns he had a name written that no man knew but himself and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his name is called the word of god and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed and fined linen white and clean and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it he should smite the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and treadeth the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of almighty god and he had on his vesture and on his thigh a name written capital king of kings and capital lord of lords in other words it's done it's done it's finished amen we have come to a place to where he wanted us to always be amen because remember it was king of little k-i-n-g-s and lord of little l-o-r-d-s which is god in us separated by sin but being our redeemer he come down and paid our price the lord said unto my lord sit here to what your enemy be made your footstool well right here his enemy had been made his footstool he's coming back with a glorified bunch of bride riding in the millennium not on horses maybe you could say if you want to okay if you like horses that's okay but horses of power coming back in power white power white okay everybody got that king of kings lord of lords i like that i think we might well i'll tell you what let's read this we'll talk about the millennium next time we're right at the millennium right let's read what brother brown says about that real quick on the next quote that was below seven let's go to eight and we'll stay right there because see we've got scriptures in jeremiah the different places where god is going david the son of david is going to set on the throne ruling the twelve tribes of israel now who is that the son of member it was son of god son of man son of david amen have i got that son of man came first though and then it was son of god then son of man comes back in the end time in a bride then he lifts off of there and then he becomes the son of david in the millennium to who us no no we're his bride that's my husband but he goes to them as a promise in jeremiah we'll read it next time i preach jeremiah 23 and jeremiah 30. if you want to read those the lord promises there'll always be someone sitting on that throne as the son of david now it's not natural lineage because they some of them went way off but remember who was david's promised son in the spiritual christ all right everybody got that so we'll read that next next time we we come so let's read this one real quick because brother brown puts it all together right here real quick and then we'll be done okay questions and answers 1964. and we'll i don't know what they're doing out here they're working so we'll find out just go ahead and eat a bite it's really cool downstairs and it will be real cool since you've been up here you walk downstairs you'll go man this is great because you know what you're sweating all over the place the church is ending and it's blacked out the bride is called and then the question was we have already entered into the tribulation period no no no i wished i could just have more time on that sea see the bride when she's taken from the church the bride church goes through tribulation bride does not but when the bride come out of her my people when the bride has come out of the church then the church age will cease laodicea goes into chaos why there's no god the bride goes to glory you're going to say no god there's no god to the gentile because listen laodicean church age that's not jewish that's gentile all right laodicea goes into chaos the bride goes to glory and the tribulation period look sets in upon the sleeping virgin for three and a half years while israel is getting its prophecy look then tribulation sets in upon israel so there's no way but barring all the scriptures that we have that tells us that after the three after the two witnesses leave that the 70 weeks of danger's over with there's no way because after then comes the bat look then tribulation sets in upon israel why their israel is getting their prophecy what is prophecy three and a half years of two witnesses preaching then they go in a rapture they're not here for the battle of armageddon but now he says then tribulation sets in upon israel and then comes the battle of armageddon which destroys all things and then the bride returns back with a groom for a thousand years the millennium reign after that comes the white throne judgment now he missed one in there i mean it's the battle of gog and magog we'll cover that but he's just showing you what's gonna happen he got tribulation tribulation on the jews battle of armageddon to destroy all things then you've got the bride and groom returning for a thousand years the millennial reign and after that comes the white throne judgment after that comes the new heaven and new earth and the new city coming down from god out of heaven eternity and time blends together because time's not over until this happens time's not over until after the great white throne judgment because you know what they did their sin in time they're going to have to have their judgment in time amen they'll have their judgment down here there'll be a white throne judgment that you and i do not want to ever come close to that but if you want to read jeremiah chapter 23 and jeremiah chapter 30. let's stand our feet musicians come we'll sing a verse a song if you need anything we will uh like i said before will it's it's almost it's just 11 so it'll give you time if you want to go eat if you want to go do whatever you want to do it'll give you at least an hour or two or more to do what you need to do and just it really gets me sometimes you know we're in this age of instant information and you i'll guarantee you'll know that the cat had your neighbor's cat had a virus and then you'll go well y'all ain't announced that we announced it 300 times just what listening amen so listen if you got a question about this service this afternoon starting at two o'clock regular time brother bob's gonna be preaching for us call somebody me brother joel or terence for luis bob leave aaron alone he's got a job to do he's pulling double duty today hey man but just ask somebody if you

o'clock i just want to depend on us having service at two o'clock then if i have to come up here and be sent home that's fine with me amen so just just pray pray for all these people that are that are fighting this disease and pray for lord for the whole bride satan said he'd turn his guns i mean the prophet said he'd turn his guns on us so but we got overcoming power and let me tell you something it's a fight you fight it and you fight it it don't matter if you're standing up here so dizzy you can't hit about to fall off and i'm not but if you did you still fight i'd rather fight and them
