witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe amen that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh unto the and world world knew him not he came into his own

pour out your power in love as we see amen amen [Music] he truly is [Music] glory amen and amen and i want to see him don't you amen good to see everybody in the house of the lord i know there's some downstairs maybe some out in the cars and whatever but we're trying to get back together and be together in the services and things and you know do everything that we can to to uh be as safe as we can but yet still um try to serve the lord and be in in the church and things just remember to pray one for another pray for my wife she's still having troubles with her her breathing and things and it's just just it hasn't got any better on her as far as the bases of what is causing because it's just clogging up and uh but we just keep praying because that's what it that's all we can do all right let's remember that uh now what we were going to try to do uh next sunday we're going to try to house you know service just like we're having it now but we're going to have communion next sunday okay so we'll do that we'll have it arranged where we can do here or downstairs whatever or do outside and have to we can just stand outside and let everybody take the communion because we want to take the communion and all like that we won't be having no foot washing but we'll be taking the communion so just remember that part okay if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn to revelations 3 14 where we've been at it then we'll go to matthew 16 and then we'll go to john 3. so just remember those announcements and any other announcements that we've got okay uh the lord would in way be ministering wednesday we've got to get him in to get him to working on these things because i don't want to get in there too much with him i'm trying to stay in the line because he's he's dealing with that's what's been so amazing with me all the brothers that have been ministering they're all coming into the same line and lining up and i really like it that way i like to see it that way and it ain't planned because we don't get together and say well okay you take this and i'll take that one as a matter of fact i try to take something pull it out a little bit different to where that you know that you're not using just the same line or the same thought keeping the same thought maybe but not in the same line okay all right revelation 3 14. father we thank you for this day in your grace thank you for everything thank you for being you and we pray that you just lord will come among us today and we'll bring your word forth that we may all lord learn from you because that's our point of thought that we may just all come to to that position in you that we are letting you lead us and guide us in our lives and directions and everything lord just bless the sick be with each one touch our wife lord and deliver from that condition we believe your word and we thank you for it it says by your stripes they're healed and many sicknesses among us and we believe you many sickness around the world all of these viruses and all these things father we just pray that you would just hasten today to get us out of this come on the scene lord that you would be the one that would have the preeminence in our hearts and lives and get us ready to take us out of here because we don't want to stay in this way in this situation lord it just keeps getting worse and worse so we don't want to do that we want to get out of here and go home and lord you just have your way with each one of us and forgive our sins lead us in jesus name amen revelations 3 14 everybody knows this one but it's the message to this age and unto the angel of the church of the lady of sea and is right these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god okay let's go now to matthew 16 starting with verse 13. when jesus came into the coast of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that i the son of man am they said some say thou art john the baptist some elise and others jeremiahs are one of the prophets he said unto them but whom say ye that i am and simon peter answered and said unto him thou art the christ the son of the living god all right and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock will i build my church in the gates of hell shall not prevail against it now remember that's what we're bringing it to eventually coming to the point of the bride of christ in the position okay now we'll go to john 3 16. for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son now remember his only begotten all right now that means the only one ever begotten that away adam was begotten in the bases that he was created jesus was not begotten in the fact of being created that way he was born from a woman and it was to be in that place in a position so just keep that in mind that we get to that place now only begotten that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god you may be seated the lord at his blessing to the reading of the word so we will try to have that way we're announcing it ahead of time and all we will try to have communion next uh sunday and all and get back in because i hate to when we can't have the services and things the way that we need to but you have to do the best you can to get by you know we could say well we're just going to do this we're going to do that but that's there's no need of doing that we just continue right along and everything will work out and god will work it out so we're to come to the right place you know in the right time all right now what are we talking about the beginning of creation now title that because of the quote the prophet made in the message but we're reading about where the beginning of the creation of god well right now uh we're we're using the title this is part three of beginning of creation because that way it's not just speaking of one thing it's the speaking of the beginning of the creation of god to come forth as the great jehovah god and thank all of that then it comes into the beginning of the creation of god because you've got to come into this spiritual creation of the son of god and then we'll come over to the church so we're getting it and see that's why i'm using it instead of trying to say the beginning of the creation of god because that's uh that's just bringing it down to a technical point now that we have spoken to services already about this and we'll really view a little bit of the message this morning you know in in our doing all right beginning of creation what is the beginning that was our life service what is the beginning what does beginning mean you say well it just means it starts well those things are human terminologies but not the biblical form of what we're to understand or the the uh the way that god wants us to bring it see and and we've tried to emphasize it over and over that beginning is not we think it's a starting point well that's not said those are okay all of those form but that's not the work the way that you understand things in the biblical form or understanding all right because you're dealing with the beginning of the creation of god and you you keep coming down to where that you're you're coming down to where we are and in doing that it's not it's not just a starting point because what we're doing is we're finding out that uh to me i like it this way i wrote it down to where i'd remember it this way see to me when you talk about the beginning like i'm trying to bring out of what i'm speaking about and trying to quote the things of the prophet and bring it out the way he's saying it is when something comes forth in another form in other words you got it in a form it's in a form all right there's a form there all right but then you can say the beginning of the creation of god you say all right now in another form but it's the same person in another form we're going to be going through the and that's what i'm driving out of the godhead for us to understand what it is see because we're going to be dealing today with like immorphy or the change or the christ to where that we can try to get into that point but it's when something comes forth in another form to make known right and really now listen this may sound funny but listen to my my thinking when something comes forth in another form what it does it makes known the original form that's kind of just let that kind of dwell in your thinking for a little bit that it's it's not a uh doing away with this and coming over here see that's what we think about we get those things in line but that's not the point see my point is when something will come forth in another form all right it doesn't do away with the original form it enhances or magnifies or or makes it to come out into view to where that you can really begin to see all right and it it it takes that no makes that known or reveals what's there see you could never see the bride of christ and who she is unless you had some background to see how all of that come forth so you just say well where's the bride of christ where no see this what i'm talking about goes all the way back into eternity and comes out from that in the position or situation to express the the the way god wanted it expressed all right what's been our thought we're brother branham on questions and answers says god's first creation was himself well that's odd speaking but if you'll think about what he's saying it's not odd see if you'll think of the point that he's saying because what he's saying is something is going to come forth and you say well it had a beginning it had a beginning when it started coming forth but as it comes forth to fulfill that part there it will be then there'll be more to unfold or change a form me and you can begin to see see then that way is my point of why first we see god all right now you're talking about jehovah god elohim self-existing first we see that we see him as he's there all right we have to see him by the eye of faith because we cannot see baptized our natural eyesight so by the eye of faith we see the great supernatural eternal elohim the self-existing one all right but he never had a beginning now he had a beginning in the basis that there was a time he changed his form from one form to another form and as he does that makes him come into manifestation just like well there was a time there brother ray he was just a little little kid running around all right he he had that form that was his form that was the way he was manifesting but see then one day become a teenager one day become all right one day he become married let's see and that made him a husband but did it change his form it didn't change the form of him it's the same person all right see then one day from that wedding that he got married and become you know husband then next you see that he's father all right what has happened it's not another person and he's not a beginning it's uh the beginning part of it all only thing is is it says well okay he couldn't have been a father all the time because he was a child so then that way we understand the terminologies and get into it in in knowing the bible see but there's a day came that he became a granddaddy what is that another form but the same person the all right father son and holy ghost is the same person being made known in a a form all right that he is see and then morphe a form okay so now his first creation was god himself now this we're talking about is the spiritual creation we're not talking about natural things we're not into that yet so hold that point keep this in mind line it across i have not deliberately spoke anything about the flesh man i had to to show the background and the thought but my mind has not been on the fleshly part of the lord jesus christ neither has it been on the fact of god having a bodily form that would be humanly fleshly my whole thoughts has been on the spiritual part the coming forth of god to where that man could comprehend him all right and in doing that he has to do it this way you say no i i think you already done it well now you go talk to him about that because i'm just going to make it plain this is the way he said it and this is the only way it can be done you can fuss with him about what you think he ought to done but i'm not going to fuss with him i'm going to just say this is the way in other words he had to come this way to come down the stages or steps or form or in morphes or whatever to bring himself out into the open to where that he could be comprehended because remember what we brought out in in the lord jesus in the last message we dealt a lot about the how that he declared him he brought him out in the open he shone the father all right but still in doing that mankind couldn't understand because they couldn't follow that line all right but you see you and i are not in those days a word that we shouldn't understand we should understand by having the prophet's message to be able to to study from we should have a whole lot better understanding or opportunity to comprehend what is being done all right see then for him to say that god's first creation was himself that wasn't something that he didn't exist and then he came into existence no it's how that he existed in another form he existed in another form then he comes forth see changing his form not his person not his personality not his do it see the one true and living god it's the main thing i'm trying to get us all to see is to study in that because it'll it'll help us and keep it lined up so he's he wasn't non-existent as far well god just wasn't and well he was just a spirit well remember when you're talking about god and you say he's just a spirit don't use that word just just say he's a spirit leave it that way because when you say he's just you're taking away you're making him not being you're making the spirit man not be anything now remember the spirit being is what we were talking about in the last message and what was it he came forth and made known the father all right now so then he never done away with the father he unveils him he unshows him or reveals him or makes him known and that's what he's been doing so he's been changing his form from the point that something that could not be seen or understood then by the changing of his form then he could show what he was and to change his form he would have to change his form like brother ray as i said he changed his form now you can understand see you can understand that there he was all the time the same person but he's made manifest in more ways or different ways are changing his form all right and see now to do those things then see here comes kathy she has to fit into the picture as well as brother ray did because the day he married see he took another person into his uh showing of himself or are revealing himself see another person got involved that's how we do right that's where we'll get to that and we'll see that when it comes to the bride of christ see she's not a she's not another person she's part of him all right made manifest in another form as we'd say called a bride so don't forget what our point is to try to understand why we'll talk about in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god in the beginning were where did that start or what happened what would be the beginning see and find out these things then will come unveiling be start unveiling to us to where we can see it all right so he was the first now here's here's one that we're going to get down to it when we get to the bride form you'll really this statement will come into view a whole lot more that he becomes more involved it takes more to reveal him in other words that's right that's right what are we doing today we're supposed to be making him known that's the bride she's making him known but not doing away with him it just takes all of the things that god has to unveil for us to be able to see and as i'm said about it then you you study uh eternity goes this far that way as it goes that way it's all right see we're not going back until it becomes a non-existent the further we go that way the more comes into view the further we go that way the more comes into view it doesn't end it just makes that circle and connects it together and we'll see what we're doing here and the purpose in life of what we're doing all right we get the point now so the first creation that we talk about of the creation of god first creation was god himself now remember you've got to stay on the point here of a spiritual creation amen because you're not trying to make him a physical creation because that's what the prophet remember i gave you the quotes i'll give it back in a minute he said god never come in a body bodily form he said god can't be seen he said because god is a spirit see you had to wait six thousand i mean four thousand years as i was trying to explain the other day to come to the bases that he could step on earth in the human flesh sure all right we know that he appeared back there in many ways because that's the christ and the prophet said you say well he never come in human flesh before he said yes he did that he is in human flesh in melchizedek okay now then but what's melchizedek a form of god an amorphy and bringing god out into the open that it could be seen that's what the whole situation about it is the whole thing is studying the word of god to see god as he brings itself from the point of where that we can't comprehend him we can't understand him see i remember that and i i hope you would remember how that you first maybe started thinking about that god is a spirit when you first think about god is a spirit well he's just a spirit he's just floating around he just he just floats around there well the prophet said he's a being he said he's not like the wind so we've got to get away from our thought of what a spiritual being is see we make a spiritual being a lot of time it's something that is non-existent or can't be seen or understood well then what is god doing not what's he doing the whole thing for is to reveal himself to manifest himself or bring himself out into the open all right and see doing that then you can see that he started with a spiritual creation all right now i'm going to take these three and back of backwards to where that you'll follow me later on coming see because you'll see why i've read it like i did because it's over in revelation 3 14 in 3 14 it says the beginning of the creation of god the prophet said this is the bride creation because see that's where it finally winds up in the bride it winds up with a spiritual creation entering into a literal creation fleshly and that's as far as it's going now making that eternal is the change of the body but that's as far as it's going so see see why the scripture said the beginning of the creation of god see that that would that throws you i just don't see it so take it in the basis of beginning of creation and let that be the the the starting i mean the ending point of it but see then you've got to back up to a spiritual creation the baptism of the holy ghost then you back up from there to where you're backing up into the mind of god and coming all the way to the beginning so then what is the prophet how he keeps on saying what all god was he pours into christ now christ is not a physical creation see you got to hold on that's what i'm trying to get you to see christ is not a physical creation christ christ christ means the anointed one or the anointing see he came into human flesh and making that human flesh then be the fullness of the godhead bodily see then all god was he pours into christ you don't leave an open hole or a gap or a thought you just move it over in another form why because something else is taking place all right but as it's taking place don't leave the father so all god was he pours into christ that you know i i i know how our human mind goes and i've heard it before and you have to when people get up and be you know preachers especially try to make their points and all god was all see they're all god was well i'm sitting there what are you trying to explain you're emphasizing all god for some reason could it be that they're emphasizing that it's going to make him go out of what out of the way or become non-existent well then if it is then when you pour it over into christ see does that do away with him no that's his reform changing that's where he morphed that's where he changes his form all right see then all christ was he pours into the church well is that going to do away with christ you see i don't mean it to be wrong i just mean it to to wonder what people are thinking because i've heard it emphasized over and over and over oh now now brother all all means all and all is all so all of god was poured into christ if that's the right and the terminology you're using you've done away with god you only got to christ and then if you do away with christ you only got a bride right right see don't do away with each one comes forth in a manifestation into a greater understanding or or are multiplying it like i've always said you know 120 at one time 3 000 another time that's a manifestation or a manifesting of god in a many-membered form what about now for all these thousands of years and it's coming forth right but you see that you you may not follow why did i emphasize so much about it because i i'm trying my best to make sure that our minds doesn't get the wrong point i mean of all god in christ just do away with god okay well i i don't do away with god well where's he at well he's in christ okay that's good he's in christ but did that do away with that just because brother ray became a father did that do away with him as a son no it helps make it manifest it's it's the things that's that you're doing right see it's bringing forth those things see that way we'll be able to understand the godhead all god was he poured into christ all christ in the church take her back to the garden of eden amen right or back to the original condition as the prophet says what are you following me see then god's first creation was himself coming into view but he's coming into view in the spiritual understanding you're not trying to go back there and see if you can find some flesh no let that come on down and then when it does the bible will be right a body thou has prepared me see it'll come on down to that just like i said about the the the uh uh dedicating to the foreign church over there see that was my point there because that was my thought in mind and see each one of those was was a way for god to live or abide for a while but that wasn't all he wanted that's right amen then the next step would they you know david and then solomon you know that that didn't fulfill it because it's still something wrong all right see then you put him and bring him into natural flesh all right you got him in flesh but you still got to get the church involved to bring her to that place so then you're going to see that the beginning of the creation of god our beginning of creation is a better way of saying the words because it simply means at the beginning of creation there was a beginning of creation but that was spiritual and see when you come forth into the next stage which is the christ that we'll try to talk about today now you're coming to another change or in morphe or form but as you're doing it you're coming forth in another form another way or another not another being but another way to make manifest or make known but you got to keep it as spiritual creation because he was not a physical creation back there you got to get the spiritual part of the beginning to where he can you can see then he stands back there in spiritual form and says let there be but yet he's in a phys in a form called the theophany or logos or word or son of god see that's what i said you you say son of god to most people that's two thousand years ago here come a baby on earth that was a son of god no that's the physical part that's the natural part coming forth well see he was back there because he was the one that said let there be see god himself stepped in another form kept coming down coming down and he first he comes down into theophany logos great terminologies for us uneducated people to talk about but that's all right it just makes a point he changed his form all right he starts off as being great eternal jehovah god self-existing then he steps down in or every how you want to call it i'd say ups this is good a word is down because it's eternity but he steps into another form and he does he becomes the word he becomes the christ see that's why when they they come to jesus if you read there's about four of them or five where it speaks of him being the christ the son of the living god or the christ of god see the heart of the christ all right see that was not in no way referring to his natural flesh that was referring to the one that was within him because god brother brown said it like that he said in in body he was a man said in spirit he was god or in soul he was god all right see it was god stepping down or kept coming down until he's actually come out into human flesh a baby with no teeth that's one i love almighty god laying in a cradle as a baby but i know too that he couldn't die for my sins then so he had to keep changing forms you had to have a river jordan where you could say this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell god coming toward human flesh is what i'm talking about the beginning there was a beginning of the human flesh right that's why brother branham uses if you'll look at it he uses it this way there is hardly any time that he uses the beginning of the creation of god back in the spiritual sense i'm just laying it down for you to look at he's constantly dealing with the flesh man and he said how did god have a beginning he said in a wound of a woman that was the beginning of the creation of god it was in the wound of a mormon a baby see but you've got to look back and see how that that baby that's laying there is almighty god no no he's a son well okay let's be careful because you see i'll deal with you with son if you'll talk with me about it in my way of talking because to me the first one to come out back there that's what i've been trying to explain what god stepped over in another form in the word or the son because the son is the creator god amen all right and then he keeps coming down to whether it comes into the original way that he wants to be he wanted to be a father a certain way that's what i've emphasized to you see adam and eve adam and eve were created you could say that'd make him father but not the way he wanted right the son of man is the way he wanted it that's what your prophet said he said he become the son of man to fulfill his porn of what he wanted all right but follow me see his first creation then was a spiritual creation now you can go back and read and listen to the prophet saying it over and over and he says and what was the first man he said spirit man right what was man first man he said spirit man he said he created him a spiritual being and said that spiritual being led the animals in the garden and the thing you know right see then it's coming forth to manifest itself into the open to where that you can see that that part was this coming into being this coming into being this coming into each thing is a step or stage or a form of god coming into the being in another way another form another point until it finally comes out to be the bride of jesus christ standing on the earth when we get to glory you ain't gonna look and see a little halo up here and a little light over here a little dove over here and all this stuff that's catholicism that's your trinitarian you're going to see jesus and know who he is because he said if you've seen me you've seen the father well i want to see the father he said if you've seen me you've seen the father well i'm no joke i can't see you because that's where our trouble is we're blind in by our wording and our thoughts a lot of times and that's where i keep going over and over and over because you see when god gave forth in manifestation or changed his form from the great eternal self-existing the next stage was him manifesting himself as the word right and as it did then that was the son god gave birth brother branham says himself giving birth to a son but he wasn't giving birth to a son like this we think you remember how i kept emphasizing and i'll keep on him brother brown said god came himself he never sent a son to die for you and i that's where we think about it oh isn't it wonderful oh we love jesus because jesus just come down to die he was that next person and he's the second person or something and he come to die in our place oh isn't it wonderful how he ain't even scriptural god came himself he took upon himself another form to manifest himself as to be called a son but the son was back there not over here 2000 you know not when jesus walked on the shores of galilee because jesus walking on the shores of galilee never declared himself to be the son of god he declared himself to be the son of man all right there was a reason for that because only in the son of man could he be the father the way he wanted to be i'm quoting brother branham he could become the father why because he could sow the seed the right of man would have to be the one to sow the seed not physical seeds now come on he'd have to be the one to preach the gospel in preaching the gospel he poured out the seed that would eventually be quickened and be made into the bride of jesus christ all right see he gave himself birth to his son not that he made another what did he do he just stepped in another form i want you to see that he just stepped into another form and became the word that's right the logos and logos means speech right am i quoting brother branham do you need all of these i've got them the word logos means speech see that way jesus when he stepped out there not physically the man jesus the flesh man but when he stepped out there in the garden he could say let there be and everything could come into being why because he was that word right see now you're at john 1 in the beginning was the word brother was reading a while ago in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god it didn't become god it was god he was god all the time he changed his form but never his character nature or or i'm trying to pick up the ones that the prophets you he never changed his characteristics he never changed his nature he never changes itself the way we think about chain he changes his form he just changes to another form and manifests itself right see that way you can keep the godhead running correctly and you won't be wondering well i got this person i got this person i got that verb just bring all that together what was the quote we gave there last week we wrote around and said he was not the third person he said he was not the second person he said it was not even the first person he was the person amen yes sir see we're bringing god into a basis of not a oneness thought but into the basis of god manifesting himself to where we could comprehend but see you you understand why the dose people back there you know they killed him because he said he was god they literally killed him i used to think about that in the baptist because there was no way to comprehend we couldn't we didn't have any thoughts we could do a little bit but uh when i was in the baptist church i would not argue with you that wouldn't but one god but i couldn't explain it except for god in three persons when brother moe said you're saying the same thing everybody else is saying i said okay i won't say that no more then he ended that part because i i seen what he was saying was right all right see then i had to change my thoughts but back there i always looked at one god and wonder you mean they killed a man that never done nothing but right religious people the romans didn't kill jesus they didn't kill him they only allowed or permitted by their law the jews couldn't kill him remember so they had to go to the romans all the romans done said okay you go do what you're going to do all right but you see the romans didn't kill him the religious people i used to think then i thought well lord what's wrong you mean all you do is good and and they kill you they said you're a man making yourself god no he was god making himself a man he was coming forth in the way that he wanted to come forth and yet all they could do was just kill him could we be doing that again now let me say this because that's what i said i'll win these days i'll preach on the godhead the way i see it because you see if we don't get the godhead straight then we're just as much of a sinner our people as those were back there we'll kill him again oh no no ain't no way that i'd ever kill god that's what they done the bible says they done it what he says they'll do it to you and me what thinking they're doing god a service that's scripture thinking they're doing god a service oh no brother dale i'll never i'll i'll never kill nobody all you got to do is just twist that word let's see i'm trying to preach one god to the bases it would get away from the idea of saying well you're okay we understand now there's just one god but we really still really don't understand it i just i just brother dale i just don't under well why don't you listen and go back listen to the prophet that's where i give you the things from the message let you listen to the prophet say it it's not me saying it then amen we have the opportunity to be able to comprehend the word of god that even the theologians and the things like that could not in no way ever think about understanding it amen and he permits that to you and me he reveals his secrets to his little bride amen right god begins to unfold itself down now let's take that word beginning a minute just with a thought let's go ahead to number four don't just take a few of these little thoughts and then just leave it laying on that point of what we're talking trying to talk about so what happens this is questions and answers that's to me that's the greatest message there's too two messages who is god and uh the questions and answers on genesis if you want to get anything and stay with it you can read for days on study and read the whole questions and answers because it's going to be involved so now john he said in the beginning was the word one of her and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us god unfolding himself down to a human being compound in your thought to him of being a human being to comprehend but he's unfolding his down self down to where the human being can understand him take it in two ways and understand it now watch how he did it how did he do how did he unfold himself down to a human being that to me is i mean i don't know of no other way to say than how could a man speak like he spoke and not be god's using the man's lips come on i'm i'm we don't believe brother brown was deity but we we believe he was led of god a prophet god unfolding himself down to a human being now that's a statement that god himself unveiled himself all the way until when he became a human being what was it god was in christ reconciling the world and to himself brother brother said sure that's why we ought to understand he says in flesh said that flesh was a man he said but in soul he was god lord understand that listen and back there then when this little halo comes and we see nothing yet but just by eyes of just supernatural we see a halo standing there now that's the son of god the logos see now read it that's the son of god the logo now i can see him playing around like a little child before the father's door with all eternity you see now then in his imaginary makeup he begins to think of what things would be and i can hear him say let there be light and when he did an atom busted and the sun came into existence right jesus christ the word not jesus the flesh man the word created all things right look at the next one still in the questions and answered on genesis you talk about a big clunker you know how he made the sun then the first thing you know a big clinker fell off of it weighed about just about like the earth see the pieces that's that's the creation of of you know from the the one big ball thing blasting out and it's brother run said he's what is he doing he's writing the bible and all because he's putting the the uh stars and things into place all right what about the earth then this logos here now the son of god is watching it see he has no trouble calling the logos the son of god well yet we think son of god was 2000 years ago on the shores of galilee right when we say son of god we think two thousand years ago on the shores of galilee son of god but that was the son of man he was not fulfilling the office of son of god he was fulfilling the office of son of man the word look then this logos here the son of god is watching he lets it fall for a hundred dollars what's he doing he's writing his bible now we're standing watching it come into existence he's got something in his mind and what's he doing he's writing his first bible all of the things he's got in mind go ahead to the next one the beginning of the creation of god that is who the lord jesus says he is but those words don't mean exactly as they sound to us just taking them the way they sound has made some people in fact multitudes of people get the idea that jesus was the first creation of god making him lower than godhead now are you listening you get the idea that jesus was the first creation of god which would make him lesser right come on making him lower than godhead if god created jesus as another person see then he's lower but he says no that's not get the idea that jesus was the first creation jesus wasn't the first creation god was the first creation you say now you've got to stumble again but that's what your prophet said that's what i'm trying to get you to see jesus was not the first creation god was the first creation god himself stepped down kept coming down coming down revealing himself now he's come to the point of being the word all right he's not jesus the flesh man here he's talking about the word so you get the idea that jesus was the first creation of god making him lower than godhead you know that's where i've always asked a trinitarian who created who you say you've got three gods well who created who he was the first is the father the oldest well then if the father's the oldest you can't have them crow week one go eternal and that's your baptist doctrine one god in three persons co-equal and co-eternal i come from there i ought to know the doctrine coequal and co-eternal now how would they be co-equal how can a father be co-equal with a son who created who god created jesus and then he created everything else now watch what he says we know for a surety that jesus is god excuse me in his first creation created all the rest of the universe and whatsoever it contains but that is not right you know that doesn't line up with the rest of the bible the words are he is the beginner or author of the creation of god in other words he's bringing into manifestation author it's like writing it and handed a book or what bringing it to a creation watch now now we know that for a surety that jesus is god very god he's the creator john 1 3. jesus is the creator but not jesus the flesh jesus the christ that's why they kept saying he asked him who the man say that i am they all said you're the christ you're the son of the living god in other words in plain language they were saying you are god made manifest in flesh they may not have been able to comprehend that rightly but that's exactly what they were saying jesus was god manifested in human flesh because that's the only name god ever had was jesus amen right you see as the unveiling of god comes forth then you begin to see the things that was in your previous thoughts and ideas of doctrinal things they start going away and you start just narrowing it down but don't throw away because you see what would be the difference is whatever you're doing see he said it said people think that god created jesus and jesus created everything else he said that's not right amen well brother dale that's what it sounds like you're saying no i'm not i'm saying one thing for sure the father stepped over in another form called the son that father keeps unveiling himself because to me that father is the whole god that's who he is he's jehovah god he's the self-existing all right look then go ahead i'm just using these where you'll see the word form the mighty god unveiled before us the bible says no man has seen god at any time but the only begotten of the father hath declared him he brought him out in the open now what so moses saw him moses saw god melchizedek was god abraham saw him but moses is the one where brother brown said because you remember moses went and stood in the rock and he walked by and he saw the back parts it was the back part of a man moses saw him veiled as a man we find that jehovah the old testament was just the jesus of the new testament dr scofield says you come up with the word amorphy the word in morphe means in morphe means that he changes from supernatural to natural he just changes his mask we got him on today he just changed his mask right went from one form to another not another person that's my whole point not another person if you'll keep that thought in mind it'll clear up the god head to you that he's not in another person he's just he's the same person in another form like brother ray was a child he was a a husband he was a father his grandfather right not a different person same person just the way he unveils himself or reveals himself and see god's finality of what he's going to do is going to wind up being in his bride now i want to get to that one you know that part but i'm trying to keep this to what you're thinking because the first couple of messages we dealt on almighty god what being the first creation was god himself where that god becomes into view or unveils himself or reveals himself makes known himself and he keeps coming down and then when he does outcomes the prophet said the logos the the theophany the word and begins to create and then when he creates he keeps coming down in his creation and he brings man down and he creates man in the image of himself which was a spirit man are a spiritual being they're in genesis let us make man in our image you know a spiritual being that's not the human flesh come on we've been in the message long enough for you to understand right around said that's the spirit man he said in genesis 2 is the flesh man genesis 2 was when he was created in flesh genesis 1 was where he was there in spirit and actually genesis you're going to have to take this and put it in the right category because but genesis 1 1 when you get over to uh 17 18 you remember you followed way back before eternity because that man that was made in in genesis 1 was a spirit man flesh man genesis 2 don't get those two involved in in the wrong way spirit man he was a spiritual being he was in god's image because he was god himself who was there adam that's why i've always tried to teach it and get you to understand it go to blasphemous names brother branham in blasphemy his name said adam had eternal life in his soul and he says in the question as an answer to conduct and order that eve was in adam and theophany so if adam had an eternal soul then eve had an eternal soul they were eternal people the only two that was dire that's why i said you will get to it see adam and eve was like from creation straight into the point of putting them into uh spiritual condition then they were brought into natural condition but jesus didn't have to come this way and then come that way he was dead all the time he was why he said he was the only begotten that's why it is that a way see the only one begotten we'll get to that in the next message the only one begotten coming from the wound of a mother why because we've got to have a way to get these bodies and he had to come that way for us to be able to handle this situation and become the children of almighty god let me go on all right listen what did we get to we're uh word in morphe which meant that he changed from supernatural to natural he just changes his mass go to the next one this is the unveiling of god he says but the word kenos in the greek does not mean that he vomited up or his arm went all for his eye went out and i mean another person it doesn't mean that too that is he changed himself he poured himself into un to amen into another mask into another form not another person went out of him called the holy spirit but it was he himself you get it god all the fullness of the godhead bodily was in this person jesus christ he was god and god alone not a third person or a second person or a first person but the person god veiled in human flesh jesus was that god now that's why i see he could not die as son of god that's why he kept referring to himself and kept himself from referring all the time he never referred to himself as son of god because you can't kill son of god now son of man was the human flesh the human flesh could die and did die when the life left out of it that's why the bride of christ has got to get to that place i've tried my best to preach it for for 50 years to you the bride of jesus christ is going to be the son of man your prophet said it made manifest here in earth it's the bride or god in another form called a bride call the bride you say yeah but that's just making it too much no it ain't we're just making us what we are we are his children we are his offspring if we're his children then we have eternal life if we don't have eternal life we're not his children why adam and eve could have eternal life in their soul but not in their body because they were created they were created physically spiritually first then physically god changing his form what's the next one remember the word form we're talking about just take this one and read it after he appeared in another form onto two of them as they walked and went on their way you know that that's the two going on the road to emmaus another form they didn't understand him they didn't they didn't know who he was right the only way it could be he could be made known and really brother branham will never emphasize that point but the bible tells you he was known in the breaking of the bread but you find where brought around use that very much i don't i don't understand why he didn't i've always studied that that way but see they would they could not understand him but when he was breaking the bread it come back they knew who that was but the bible said he had disappeared and nobody went out because he was in another form now what does that mean it means the same thing when mary was standing there and thinking it was a gardener that was in the tombs there you know and she's talking to the gardener but he finally says mary and when he said mary she knew who he was right why because there was some way that he was unveiled he was something he didn't understand maybe it's the point like i've always had it this is this way i believe it is here he's a young man standing there last mary saw him with an old man 50. right right you know you're not 50. and there he stood she couldn't understand him but when he spoke the creator spoke from eternity says mary she understood then didn't she okay come on let's go what do we got let's go to one what do we got on who do you say this is you know the unveiling okay he sent down the holy spirit which was god again in just another form on the day of pentecost now these are just quotes for using for that go ahead to the next one he came in another form because that's what we want to do in the church ages as the age comes along god just moves in another form and it's god all the time the word the word made flesh and dwelt among each church age was god and morphy are changing his form each church age changing the second church age third church age fourth church each age was him in another form because that's the way he's always go ahead to the next we'll get down to the end this is off of the first seal now the holy spirit and the revelation of jesus christ is the holy spirit is christ in another form that's right notice it is a lamb that opened the book and the lamb is christ go ahead we got one more i think you see that's where we come with the word in morphe you spell it in morphe just roll it on up we'll get to the to the point when he see when the in morphe that means that he changed himself he come down now listen now the greek word there means that something that could not be seen yet it's there and then it's changed and the eye can catch it see that's what he's been doing all this time going from one form to another form as to what the eye could comprehend all right see that's why mankind how could they in any way understand here was a man stood on this earth i could i can understand like i said i couldn't understand how that why they killed him i could understand why they didn't agree with him i'm a human being i can understand he spake like no man's fake i've had a man standing there and he said before abraham was i am what about all the things the lord jesus was saying to mankind no wonder they didn't understand him amen but now we don't have an excuse because we have the baptism of the holy ghost which is the same holy ghost that was back there in him in us to teach us the word right see changing his form all right so thou are the christ to peter when jesus asked him what did men say thou art the christ you're the christ one of them says the christ of god christ means the anointed one or the logos the same word anointing and logos and speech is exactly back in but if you'll go to that on the questions and answers on genesis and if you'll just read that first that whole message you'll see what i'm talking about you'll see the very things that i've done and i'll be glad to give you the notes here most of you having right now but to forget you to understand see the godhead is easy to understand if we don't take our thoughts we take his thoughts think his thoughts on it and just think about it that same god it was back there as the self-existing kept changing its form until one day he walked on earth dwelled in a body that same god gave his life came back on the day of pentecost in a many-membered bride right changed his form not his person not even brother brown said not even his personality because if you change your personality you change your person but it's not even your personality god's word you understand what i'm getting that's the the point we spent two services to explain the beginning part of it this service is to express the fact that back there as he come forth in another form he became the word the word the logos the speech the son of god see that's what i said we thank the son of god 2000 years ago that that's our terminology well now he's saying no he was just the word even scofield read you you've got a scofield bible read it he tells you the amorphies and the things brother brown probably read a lot of that from schofield the amorphous and the things like that bringing god out into the open that he could be understood but not doing away with him not doing away with anything you just keep moving it over brother ray as he was a baby he couldn't manifest himself in ways but there come a day that he could have a comprehensions of his life and beings because he'd become a man then he became a father and he became a grandfather and you know what i'm talking about them them the difference in the father and the grandfathers is grandkids don't ever do anything wrong right you got any grandkids you know what i'm talking about they they can get by with bloody murder but you know what they're the same person the same being because they're your children think on these things the christ we'll pick that up because he said i'm having to make it compound because the christ in this that i'm talking about is the christ that was back there before the world that created the christ the son of the living god was the creator god then when peter steps up and says he's speaking right directly to the man that's standing there right that's where we'll pick up at peter was speaking right to the man a man and says thou art the christ the son of the living god he said now flesh and blood hasn't revealed this to you peter but sit upon the revelation of who i am remember that upon the revelation of who it was you know how he's how the prophet explained it one group over here thinks he was this away one thinks he's this way but what was he the church is built on a revelation of jesus christ what that jesus christ is almighty god not just built on the revelation of jesus christ as a man but that he was the very god of glory and the gates of hell can't prevail against that revelation but yet it'll beat on it hammer on it it's done it over all these years but they are the christ and i'll build my church on this right the gates of hell can't prevail against you why because you'd be going against him but yet not to understand it we're going against him do you understand what i made there while ago or thought was he listening if we don't stay with the truth of one true and living god we're just as bad as everybody else i don't care how much you can quote i don't care how much you can read in time if it's not something revealed to you personally we're just as denominational as any denomination has ever been we're just as denominated as anybody's ever been so you see now in the last days what are the ministers of this message attacking come on you that went out tournament you that heard these things what are they attacking they're attacking the revelation of jesus christ why because they say well jesus wouldn't god until the river jordan well the bible said he was born lord to christ what about it could we be just like anybody else let's be careful let's walk soft in our understanding and keep our ideas into that line let's stand together come on musicians on these things how about your understanding of one god has it increased over time what it says you'll go back to questions and answers on genesis and just read that message you can't get it in those others it's for certain in the conduct order and doctrine but see to understand that jesus christ was almighty god the christ the christ is the holy ghost that we're going to get to next which comes into the bride of christ so now we've covered what all god was he poured into christ christ is the fullness of the godhead bodily and that's the lord jesus christ and coming down in his life and coming to manifestation now next we'll have to start dealing with that christ because there was a cross in the old testament there was a god in the old testament that made himself manifest in many ways but it was the christ not jesus because jehovah the oldest jesus of the new see then we're just gradually coming through understanding but we haven't left anything we haven't left anything of the father haven't left anything of the son we come into you and me it won't be leaving anything he'll be in manifestation what we got page 251 all in him the might almighty god is jesus the prince of peace is he the everlasting father the king eternally anybody in wisdom think on the sides in whom all things were made the christ fullness of the goddess it's all in him it's all in him the fullness of the godhead it's all in him it's all in here it's all in here the mighty god is jesus and it's all in him emmanuel god just remember [Music] [Music] the author [Music] the fullness of the gods here his name is jesus it's all in him the mighty god is jesus and it's all in him the alpha [Music] our righteousness [Music] because the bride says the last that god has it's all it is [Music] [Applause] understanding [Music] when jesus comes again read that word [Music] it's all in him it's all in him the fullness of the godhead it's all in him it's all in him it's on amen in him the mighty god is jesus and it's all in him father we thank you for this day and
