[0:00] recording
[0:07] everybody see him yes sir
[0:12] good morning
[0:18] good morning
[0:22] so let's read
[0:25] free from verse one
[0:28] if everything do it and seeing the most
[0:32] juicy went up into a mountain and when
[0:33] he was said his disciples came into him
[0:35] and he opened his mouth and taught them
[0:36] saying blessed are the poor in the
[0:38] spirit for theirs is the kingdom of
[0:39] heaven this is the Kingdom of Heaven
[0:42] because they realize there's no
[0:43] righteousness in themselves and they
[0:44] start hungering and searching for for uh
[0:47] righteousness that only God can give
[0:49] well listen to that mourn for they
[0:51] should be comforted right
[0:52] by the comforter blessed are the meat
[0:54] fellatio inherent the Earth they inherit
[0:56] the Earth because they realize that uh
[0:59] the prophet that was sent for their age
[1:00] or the uh the ministers have something
[1:04] that
[1:05] um will at the end we'll read a little
[1:08] story about somebody who realized that
[1:10] they needed somebody else to teach them
[1:12] and they realized that um they begin by
[1:16] through meekness they hear the word
[1:17] blessed are they which do hunger and
[1:19] thirst after righteousness for they
[1:21] shall be filled
[1:23] and by being filled they begin to feel
[1:25] God's word and then we get to blister
[1:28] the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy
[1:30] when God's word begins to be fulfilled
[1:32] in you then you begin to exhibit these
[1:34] characteristics of the righteous and the
[1:37] first that's listed in the Beatitudes is
[1:40] merciful now um don't think that all the
[1:43] first four Beatitudes are not
[1:45] characteristics of someone that's also
[1:47] feel because through all through your
[1:49] journey you you continue to have it well
[1:53] poor be poor in spirit mourn for the
[1:56] condition of yourself the war the war
[1:58] with the Flesh and the um to continue to
[2:02] pray for your family and the people
[2:03] around you that aren't living right and
[2:06] you continue to be me studying the word
[2:08] and then we get to righteousness where
[2:11] God gives you power
[2:13] and you become merciful and so let's if
[2:18] you if you can kind of look at these
[2:20] they're kind of grouped in in pairs
[2:23] and uh that helps us understand because
[2:25] if you don't understand what one is you
[2:27] kind of look at the other and it kind of
[2:28] helps you pour in spirit if you're poor
[2:31] in spirit you begin to mourn meekness
[2:33] meekness means you begin to realize that
[2:36] the these ministers that the people that
[2:39] have the rights is just being revealed
[2:41] can uh reveal to you God's word and you
[2:45] uh open up the message but open up um
[2:50] put the tape in the tape player and
[2:52] press play and you begin his to hunger
[2:55] and thirst after righteousness and his
[2:58] word begins to be revealed in you
[3:00] now when his word is revealed and then
[3:02] you've got power and you can be merciful
[3:04] and pure in heart if you if your pure in
[3:06] heart the promise is that you will see
[3:08] God
[3:09] peacemakers and and persecuted so um
[3:12] we'll get into these a little bit more
[3:14] detail but the thing is
[3:16] you can't I mentioned last time that to
[3:19] be truly reversible you've got to be
[3:21] filled with the Holy Ghost because to be
[3:23] merciful you first must be in a position
[3:26] of power right because the homeless
[3:28] people that I come in contact with on
[3:30] the street in Atlanta they're not in a
[3:32] position of power to be merciful to me
[3:33] but I am to them I can when they I have
[3:36] one come up to me and say will you buy
[3:38] me something to eat and I said you come
[3:40] on through and you can buy whatever you
[3:42] want fill it up fill up your plate
[3:44] whatever you want and that's that's our
[3:46] approach to um once you're in a position
[3:49] with power then you could be merciful to
[3:51] the others to call them into a
[3:54] relationship with Christ just like we
[3:56] have that's what real Mercy is remember
[3:58] calling people into a relationship with
[4:00] God right let's review what
[4:02] righteousness is it's moving from
[4:04] righteousness to righteousness to Mercy
[4:06] it's a hard word to say this morning
[4:09] let him brother Graham was talking about
[4:12] him I think it's Revelations 22 where uh
[4:15] said let him this holy be holy steal to
[4:18] him this righteous be rise of Steel the
[4:19] righteous word of God the Son of God May
[4:21] manifest
[4:22] or that when when the when the um the
[4:26] spirit of God is lifted from the earth
[4:27] and the bride goes up let him this
[4:29] righteous be righteous still and what
[4:31] righteousness is is the Son of God they
[4:33] manifest the word being mean manifest in
[4:35] you and so to be righteous
[4:39] righteousness gives you power to be
[4:41] merciful
[4:42] blessed are the merciful for they should
[4:44] obtain mercy so there's a natural
[4:46] there's a natural uh way of looking at
[4:49] this is that if you um
[4:51] like on my jaw I'm merciful to the
[4:53] people that are under me and that causes
[4:55] them to be merciful to me I work harder
[4:57] for me right uh if you're merciful to
[4:59] the people around you then that that
[5:01] causes them to see that you that you
[5:03] love them that you want the best for
[5:04] them and um
[5:06] so that's the natural is just be good to
[5:09] people but then there's also the
[5:10] spiritual be merciful to uh Mercy real
[5:14] Mercy is withholding from someone what
[5:16] they deserve and uh we all deserve
[5:19] judgment we all deserve God's judgments
[5:22] so a lot of times we come into
[5:23] situations where people uh maybe from us
[5:26] deserve our harsh words and
[5:28] um deserve us to unsheet our sword so to
[5:31] speak but um
[5:33] when you put your sword back in your
[5:35] sheet that's true uh that's Mercy right
[5:39] the wicked bar with them payth not again
[5:41] but the righteous show with mercy and
[5:43] give us that's what the righteous do
[5:44] it's an attribute of being righteous
[5:46] right
[5:48] and we looked last time at uh what The
[5:51] Mercy Seat is propitiation the word
[5:53] propitiation of Romans 325 and the word
[5:55] mercy seat in Hebrews 9 5 is the same
[5:57] word
[6:00] Mercy is the kind Elders Bible
[6:03] dictionary said Mercy is the kind of
[6:04] passionate treatment of an offender
[6:06] adversary prisoner and one's power
[6:08] someone in your power compassion where
[6:11] severity is expected or deserved Mercy
[6:13] is kindness or as strong as he said
[6:15] Mercy is kindness a good will toward the
[6:17] miserable and The Afflicted joint with a
[6:18] desire to help them oh men towards the
[6:20] men of God towards men the mercy of
[6:22] Christ whereby his return of judgment he
[6:24] will bless true Christians in eternal
[6:26] life we're looking for yeah and The
[6:29] Mercy Seat is the Holy Ghost wrote
[6:32] around said so last time we walked
[6:34] through the day of atonement and how the
[6:36] high priest went in through the um
[6:41] to offer sacrifice to offer the
[6:43] atonement the atonement the goat had
[6:46] been killed one of the pair that one was
[6:49] escaped out the other was the god that
[6:51] God's goat and uh the high priest took
[6:54] the blood of the offering went through
[6:55] the holy Place
[6:56] passed by the table of showbread where
[7:00] there was no seat there's no there's no
[7:02] place to sit there's no place to rest
[7:03] and all the Tabernacle walked into the
[7:06] opportunity police where the only seat
[7:08] was
[7:09] the only place of rest the only product
[7:12] provided place of rest is is under God's
[7:15] shed blood
[7:17] and the evidence that the offering had
[7:20] been paid was placed was sprinkled on
[7:22] the emergency The Mercy Seat is deleted
[7:25] it's important to remember that the
[7:27] mercy seat and the cherubimes are one
[7:29] piece they were made out of one the same
[7:32] solid gold piece that's right because
[7:34] the cherubim was down through this
[7:36] church ages or God God's life God's
[7:40] power made manifest in a church it's
[7:42] attached to The Mercy Seat which is a
[7:45] representative of the Holy Ghost
[7:48] and we talked about how in Investments
[7:50] the the Israelites looked into the art
[7:52] they removed the the um the covering
[7:56] they removed the covering and peered
[7:58] into the law and because of that they
[8:00] died God took their life
[8:03] so The Mercy Seat is God's covering now
[8:07] Mercy is not a lot of people look at oh
[8:09] for example Catholics look at Mercy This
[8:12] Promise of the merciful shall receive
[8:14] Mercy as as this is how you're saved but
[8:18] you're not saved because that you stand
[8:20] in the soup liner because you do good
[8:22] things to different people it's it's
[8:24] you're saved by God's by God
[8:27] um
[8:28] Mercy is not taking taking what you've
[8:31] done and throwing it out the window it's
[8:33] God paid the price who paid the price so
[8:36] all of your sins that were maybe look at
[8:38] it like written down they were all
[8:40] blotted out and that's what Mercy is God
[8:42] took care of the um of all your sin and
[8:47] the evidence is the baptism of the Holy
[8:50] Ghost that his righteousness will be
[8:52] made manifest in you and then when you
[8:54] have that when you have that when you
[8:56] ever see Mercy then you can demonstrate
[8:59] Mercy right
[9:02] Mercy is a trait of righteousness Psalm
[9:05] 37 we looked at that already that we
[9:07] could borrow it's going to pay if not
[9:08] again but the righteous show of mercy
[9:09] and give a second Corinthians 1 3 to 4
[9:12] blessed be God even the father of our
[9:13] Lord Jesus Christ the father of mercies
[9:15] and the God of All Comfort who comforted
[9:18] us who Comfort us us in all our
[9:20] tribulation that we may be able to
[9:23] comfort them which are any trouble in in
[9:26] any trouble by the Comfort wherewith we
[9:28] ourselves are comforted of God and
[9:30] that's what Mercy is God the father of
[9:33] Mercy if we're like our father we'll we
[9:36] will also demonstrate what he is to
[9:39] others what he has demonstrated to us
[9:41] Luke 6 36 to 38 be therefore merciful is
[9:45] also your father as your father also is
[9:47] a merciful judge not we shall we not be
[9:49] judged it goes on to tell us how to be
[9:51] merciful condemn not give and it shall
[9:54] be given unto you you can measure press
[9:55] down and shaken together and running
[9:57] over shall men give into your bosom for
[9:58] with the same measure that you meet
[10:00] whether it shall be measured to you
[10:02] again thank you
[10:06] and numbers 14
[10:10] this is Moses
[10:12] being merciful to the children of Israel
[10:15] now our deceased still let the power of
[10:17] my Lord be created for these out spoken
[10:19] with the Lord is long-suffering and of
[10:20] great Mercy for giving iniquity and
[10:22] transgression and by no means clearing
[10:25] the guilty visiting the iniquity of the
[10:26] fathers upon the children under the
[10:28] third and fourth generation far number
[10:30] 60 the iniquity of this people according
[10:32] into the greatness of thy mercy and as
[10:34] thou has forgiven his people from Egypt
[10:36] even until now even though Moses didn't
[10:38] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost he
[10:40] had a relationship with God he knew what
[10:42] kind of person God was that he was
[10:44] long-suffering of great mercy and he
[10:46] called that God remembers the type of
[10:48] person that he knew God were and pleaded
[10:50] with him to show them mercy and
[10:52] Deuteronomy 4 31 for the Lord thy God is
[10:55] a merciful god he will not forsake thee
[10:57] and neither destroy thee nor forget the
[10:59] Covenant of thy father in which he swear
[11:01] on them
[11:03] this is such great promises when you
[11:05] when you uh when you get on your knees
[11:07] and you need God to remember you uh
[11:10] remind God of his promises I know that
[11:12] thou art a merciful god he will not
[11:14] forsake me well Psalm 86 5 for the hour
[11:17] Lord aren't good and ready to forgive
[11:19] and plenteous and mercy unto all in that
[11:21] call upon me in Genesis 14 remember lot
[11:24] and Abraham's people had argued over got
[11:27] that little argument over the well and
[11:29] then uh they Abraham said a lot you go
[11:32] ahead and go off in whatever Direction
[11:33] you want in any direction and then a lot
[11:36] got kidnapped by Tim Leonard and Abraham
[11:39] and his Mercy went to lot and delivered
[11:40] him now the only way Abraham could show
[11:43] Mercy the lot was first he had to have
[11:45] power if he'd only have had uh maybe one
[11:48] or two little men to that uh in his in
[11:51] his army but um
[11:53] God put Abraham in a position that he
[11:56] could show Mercy a lot and go deliver
[11:57] everybody Joseph was in a position of
[12:01] power to forgive the Brethren that had
[12:03] treated him wrongly Moses cried after um
[12:06] when uh remember Miriam and Aaron came
[12:09] to Moses and said are you the only one
[12:12] that God talks to and then Moses showed
[12:15] them mercy of God on his knees and cried
[12:17] on the Lord saying heal her now oh God I
[12:19] deceased him now that's Mercy if you
[12:21] don't know what Mercy is yeah
[12:23] David
[12:24] was merciful to Saul's life when God put
[12:27] gave David power over Saul and put David
[12:31] in the cave with him and he cut off the
[12:34] Garment the bottom of
[12:37] Saul's
[12:38] uh that road
[12:41] um
[12:41] and then he felt bad about it later
[12:43] because Saul was God's anointed but all
[12:47] of these people were in power to give
[12:49] Mercy you got first to give Mercy you
[12:51] must have power
[12:58] in James 3 13-18 who is a wise man and
[13:02] then you with knowledge him when you let
[13:03] him show out of a good conversation his
[13:05] worst with the meekness of wisdom but if
[13:08] you have bitter ending and strife in
[13:10] your hearts Glory not and lying not
[13:12] against the truth the wisdom this wisdom
[13:14] descendeth not from above with an
[13:16] Earthly sensual devilish to where
[13:18] envying a Strife is taking your sword
[13:20] out of your sheath because you disagree
[13:23] me with me I'm going to cut you down by
[13:25] the words of my mouth for where envying
[13:27] astrology is there is confusion in every
[13:29] evil work but the wisdom that is from
[13:31] above is first pure then Peaceable
[13:33] remember the next beatitude is the pure
[13:36] of heart then Peaceable
[13:39] General and easy to be intrigued and
[13:42] full of mercy and good fruits without
[13:44] partiality and without hypocrisy and the
[13:47] fruit of righteousness is sold in peace
[13:49] of them that make peace
[13:54] I believe seeing this is just something
[13:57] I put here I believe seeing a mercy
[13:59] looks beyond sin people shortcoming
[14:02] these offenses and injuries and it looks
[14:03] to what I believe one day if if they are
[14:07] a sinner
[14:08] but one day
[14:10] I want to draw them to be like me to see
[14:15] the same things that I do that's what
[14:17] Mercy is
[14:21] Psalm 18 25 to 26 with the merciful and
[14:25] thou will show thyself merciful right if
[14:28] you're merciful to others then God will
[14:30] be merciful to you that's right but this
[14:32] is not speaking about salvation
[14:33] Salvation is not based on your works
[14:35] right it's not based on standing in the
[14:37] soup kitchen line or giving food to the
[14:39] homeless and things like that with an
[14:41] upright man that will show thyself
[14:44] upright
[15:05] with him now to finish up
[15:08] I'm going a little bit faster here
[15:11] unexpected let's turn that actually this
[15:14] is
[15:16] let's take let's take our time with this
[15:18] because this has some good
[15:19] stuff I'm gonna look at it I feel like
[15:23] you can show someone Mercy
[15:33] and I want to read the start at verse
[15:35] one because
[15:37] we talked about how first year I must
[15:39] have power to show mercy and we'll read
[15:42] about somebody who's only Power and he
[15:44] told you to get power a different way
[15:46] than through God's providing way through
[15:48] justification sanctification the bad
[15:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[15:53] and a lot of people think power is uh
[15:56] powers like how Simon the Sorcerer
[15:59] thought it was but God gives us power to
[16:02] overcome the flesh to live a Godly life
[16:05] you know real power can be demonstrated
[16:07] in just a little man carrying his lunch
[16:09] box to work or a wife in the kitchen
[16:11] frame that's real righteousness make on
[16:15] this play
[16:17] let's look at
[16:19] Acts chapter 8.
[16:21] verse 1.
[16:26] see actually let's
[16:35] let's look at verse 30 verse 4.
[16:38] therefore they that were scattered
[16:40] abroad went everywhere preaching the
[16:42] word then Philip went down to the city
[16:44] of primary and preached Christ under
[16:46] them
[16:49] and the people with the one Accord gave
[16:51] heed unto those things which Philip's
[16:53] fake hearing and seeing the Miracles
[16:56] which he did
[16:57] for unclean spirits crying with loud
[16:59] voice came out of me that were present
[17:01] with them and many were taken and many
[17:04] taken with policies and that were laying
[17:07] were healed and there was great joy in
[17:09] that City
[17:10] but there was a certain man of Simon
[17:12] which Before Time in the same city used
[17:14] sorcery
[17:16] and bewitched the people of Samaria
[17:18] giving out that himself
[17:20] was some great one
[17:22] and you can see
[17:24] today people doing the exact same thing
[17:27] saying I am the one that brother
[17:28] Reynolds spoke of that's to come and I'm
[17:31] the one that you need to listen to Irene
[17:33] said Justin Martyr wrote that after this
[17:35] story Simon went on to associate himself
[17:39] with this woman named Helen that uh
[17:41] according to irenius
[17:43] it took under uh she she valued the
[17:47] Treasures of the life more than the
[17:48] treasures above
[17:50] and Simon when it went around telling
[17:53] everybody that he was the son in one
[17:56] city and another city he was the father
[17:57] and that he was the one to manifest what
[18:01] the scriptures were open to make himself
[18:03] some big somebody because what he was
[18:06] really after was was power over people
[18:09] right
[18:13] verse 10 to whom they all gave heed from
[18:16] the least to the greatest saying this
[18:18] man
[18:19] is the great power of God
[18:21] and to him they had regard because that
[18:24] of a long time he had Bewitched them
[18:25] with sorceries for when they believe
[18:27] Philip preaching the things concerning
[18:30] the kingdom of God in the name of Jesus
[18:32] Christ
[18:33] they were baptized both the men and
[18:35] women
[18:36] they thought Simon had power when they
[18:39] heard Philip they knew he had power from
[18:42] God
[18:43] the assignment himself believed also and
[18:45] when he was baptized he continued with
[18:47] Philip and wondering by holding the
[18:49] Miracles and signs that were done that
[18:51] when the apostles which were at
[18:52] Jerusalem heard that Samaria had
[18:54] received the word of God they sent unto
[18:55] them Peter and John who when they were
[18:57] come down praying for them that they
[18:59] might receive the Holy Ghost
[19:01] of course it he was following up on none
[19:03] of them only they were baptized in the
[19:05] name of the Lord Jesus then they their
[19:07] hands on them and they received the Holy
[19:09] Ghost and when Simon saw it through
[19:10] laying home laying on with the apostles
[19:12] hands the Holy Ghost was given he
[19:15] offered them money
[19:16] you can't buy this kind of power when
[19:19] you're right you got to become God
[19:21] provided away from the street three
[19:23] steps justification sanctification and
[19:26] Simon didn't even have uh
[19:29] he didn't have crude meekness
[19:32] I need to listen to what these these
[19:35] people I can see the power of God in
[19:36] their life let me hear what they have to
[19:39] say and if it lines up with what the
[19:41] Bible says with what God's word says we
[19:43] all know that they're true
[19:48] seeing give me also this power that only
[19:50] whosoever I lay hands you may receive
[19:52] the Holy Ghost
[19:53] that Peter said unto him
[19:56] money perished with me because thou has
[19:59] thought that the gift of God made me
[20:01] purchased for money there was neither
[20:04] partner a lot in this matter for thy
[20:05] heart is not right in the sight of God
[20:08] depend therefore this is like witness
[20:10] and pray God perhaps the thought of
[20:12] thine heart may be forgiven me
[20:13] bureaucracy endowed in the gall
[20:16] bitterness and in the bond of iniquity
[20:20] then answered Simon and said pray he to
[20:22] the Lord for me that none of these
[20:24] things which ye have spoken come upon me
[20:26] and they when they have testified and
[20:28] preached the word of the Lord returned
[20:29] to Jerusalem and preach the gospel in
[20:32] many villages of the Samaritans now I
[20:34] wanted to read that because he wanted
[20:35] power but he wanted a different kind of
[20:39] power he wanted power without character
[20:41] right
[20:42] now we'll get to somebody that has power
[20:45] and and we'll continue reading and they
[20:48] showed their power about being merciful
[20:50] right and the angel of the Lord speak
[20:52] under Philip saying arise and go toward
[20:54] the South unto the way and goeth down
[20:56] from Jerusalem into Gaza which is Desert
[20:59] and you can see Gaza on the map right
[21:00] there
[21:01] down at the bottom
[21:05] and he arose and went and behold the man
[21:08] of Ethiopia and Munich of great
[21:10] authorities under Canada's Queen of the
[21:12] Ethiopians who had the charge of all of
[21:14] her treasure and had come to Jerusalem
[21:17] for to worship he was obviously in
[21:19] Jerusalem about the Passover time to
[21:21] celebrate Passover and he had he was in
[21:24] charge of all her treasure but he knew
[21:26] that the treasures of this Earth were uh
[21:30] would pass away and he was he was I
[21:33] believe at this point he was poor in
[21:36] spirit and he was mourning for his
[21:38] condition he had been in the Passover
[21:39] and realized that something something
[21:42] greater was out there for him to to find
[21:45] he said he was returning and sitting in
[21:48] his chair and he read Isaias the prophet
[21:50] then the spirit said unto go near and
[21:53] join myself to this Chariot and Philip
[21:55] ran thither to him and heard him read
[21:57] the prophet Isaiah and said understand
[21:58] this thou what thou raised and he said
[22:02] how can I here's meekness now that's
[22:04] right how can I accept some man should
[22:07] guide me and he desired to fill up that
[22:10] he would come up and sit with him
[22:14] place of the scripture which he read
[22:16] right and God was just setting
[22:18] everything perfectly up he just laid it
[22:20] in Phillip's lap here's what you're
[22:22] going to talk about
[22:23] the place of the scripture which he read
[22:25] was this he was led as a sheep to the
[22:27] slaughter and like a lamb dumb before
[22:29] his Shearer so opened he not his mouth
[22:33] and his humiliation his judgment was
[22:35] taken away
[22:36] and who shall declare his generation for
[22:39] his life is taken from the Earth
[22:43] now that's such a beautiful place to
[22:45] start a discussing with somebody because
[22:46] who shall declare his generation his
[22:49] life was cut off but now I feel it was
[22:51] going to show him how he was going to
[22:53] declare the Life of Christ
[22:55] didn't have anybody in the natural to
[22:58] declare his life now he's going to
[23:00] declare it through you and I through
[23:02] this unit
[23:05] you know the eunuch is kind of in the
[23:06] same place in the Latin natural place he
[23:09] had no way to reproduce this season but
[23:12] he was going to get he was going to get
[23:13] birth into him right
[23:15] the seed of God from above and the unit
[23:18] cancer Philippa said I prayed the of
[23:20] whom the Prophet this of himself or of
[23:23] some other man and Philip opened his
[23:26] mouth and began in the same scripture
[23:27] and preached unto him Jesus and he was
[23:30] showing him Mercy
[23:32] because he asked for immersing his it
[23:36] was in Philip's power right to show the
[23:39] same Grace of Salvation right to this
[23:41] unit
[23:42] and as they came as they went on their
[23:44] way they came into a certain water and
[23:46] the eunuch said senior Year's water what
[23:49] does hinder me to be baptized and Philip
[23:50] said if thou Believers with all thine
[23:52] heart thou missed and he answered and
[23:54] said I believe that Jesus Christ is the
[23:56] Son of God and so the unit was started
[23:59] on this way to righteousness
[24:02] and um
[24:04] and just finish on this June chapter 1
[24:07] 21-24
[24:09] keep yourselves in the love of God
[24:11] looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus
[24:14] Christ unto eternal life
[24:16] and assume have compassion like Philip
[24:19] making a difference
[24:21] and others saved with fear pulling them
[24:24] out of the fire
[24:25] hating even the Garment spotted by the
[24:28] flesh
[24:29] because if you have power then you can
[24:32] show compassion and pull others out of
[24:34] the fire to get them started on the road
[24:36] with the righteousness so that's what
[24:38] Mercy is let's stop right there
