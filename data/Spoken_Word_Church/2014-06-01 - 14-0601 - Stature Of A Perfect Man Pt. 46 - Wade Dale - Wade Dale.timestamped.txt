[0:04] we the devil didn't like this because I
[0:07] had all my you know we've been doing
[0:09] patience and all that on the screen I
[0:11] can't find them anywhere in my iPad so I
[0:14] lost him in Miami somewhere I
[0:16] again my voice and and all that so but
[0:20] you know we had a wonderful time done
[0:22] amen had a good time Still Still basking
[0:25] in the joy of of meeting you brothers
[0:28] and sisters really good solid brothers
[0:30] and sisters so here we go fifthly at
[0:32] godliness I know you probably can't see
[0:34] this in the back some of you older
[0:38] on
[0:40] but brother
[0:42] brother he's got his book He's reading
[0:45] he's got his book he going to read it
[0:47] but fifthly at godliness oh my godliness
[0:50] to be added so if God wants us to be
[0:52] Godly he's he's got to make a way for
[0:54] that to happen amen right I looked in
[0:57] four or five dictionaries and couldn't
[0:59] even find what he meant finally I was
[1:01] down at brother Jeff and he got a
[1:02] dictionary said
[1:05] godliness go
[1:09] back go
[1:16] back manually go
[1:20] back you ask here we go all
[1:27] right godliness means to be like
[1:30] now that's just pretty simple but now
[1:33] brother B couldn't just stop there and
[1:35] say oh we just got to be like God he's
[1:37] got to give us Provisions he's got to
[1:40] give us a provision for this journey if
[1:42] you got a good guide a good guide don't
[1:45] take you 20 mi back in the woods and say
[1:49] we don't have no food
[1:52] right they'd be one less God in the camp
[1:55] if he did that to
[1:57] me so anyway shoot it well no I don't
[2:00] know I'm at patience now I think so I I
[2:03] think I'd be patient one day with him
[2:05] until he got me some
[2:07] food but see the guide made a provision
[2:11] before you got there if he's a good
[2:14] guide he'll ask you do you want coffee
[2:16] in the morning you know I've been on
[2:18] several hunts like that you want coffee
[2:19] in the morning what do you want for
[2:21] breakfast what do you want for lunch and
[2:23] he'll map it out but you don't have to
[2:24] get it he gets it for you amen so he
[2:26] makes the provisions for you the Holy
[2:28] Ghost makes the provision for you before
[2:30] you even start your journey right so
[2:33] let's just put it this way we are living
[2:35] well below our privileges because the
[2:37] God's already there the God's already
[2:39] waiting on us to get on the horse he's
[2:41] already got the horse packed the pack
[2:43] horse is ready to go it's already got
[2:45] the provision it's just we got to say
[2:46] let's go all
[2:49] right it says to be like God after you
[2:51] got faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[2:53] patience then to be like God you say I
[2:55] can't do that brother brandom oh yes you
[2:57] can now there's a prophet prophet
[3:00] prophesying yes you can amen all
[3:04] right let me just read you a few
[3:06] scriptures here just a minute Matthew
[3:08] 5:48 we'll take this one and see what it
[3:10] sounds like Matthew 5:48 see if you're
[3:12] supposed to be like God you know the
[3:14] Bible says you're
[3:16] Gods okay Jesus said so see to me that's
[3:20] going back to Genesis 1:26 when they
[3:22] pick up the the Revelation and says ye
[3:24] are Gods you go right back to Genesis
[3:27] 126 cuz there you are the god of the
[3:28] earth remember the little G not the big
[3:30] G but the little G right right all the
[3:33] virtues all the things that's that's in
[3:35] God is in you amen now you believe that
[3:39] amen it's the same Holy
[3:42] Ghost Jesus speaking in the Beatitudes
[3:45] be ye therefore p e r f e c what's that
[3:49] perfect even as your father in Heaven is
[3:52] perfect like we were talking about Miami
[3:54] we've done the series here on the
[3:55] Masterpiece family Daddy has also if you
[3:58] have the genetics of your father
[4:00] you're going to act like your father so
[4:03] he has got that provision even as your
[4:05] father in Heaven is perfect so you got
[4:07] to be perfect just like he's Perfect all
[4:09] right you get way up here now before
[4:12] you're asked to do that you see God's
[4:15] got these vertues laid out he knows you
[4:17] got to have this one and this one and
[4:18] this one and this one before you come to
[4:20] Godliness all right cuz if you have
[4:22] Godly patience Temperance and knowledge
[4:24] and virtue working in your life you're
[4:26] getting close to being like God the way
[4:28] he wants you to be okay you get way up
[4:31] here now before you're asked to do that
[4:33] all these things has to be added first
[4:35] remember what we were talking about you
[4:37] can't say well I got virtue and now I'm
[4:39] going to try for patience no the guide
[4:43] didn't say that the guide said virtue
[4:46] then knowledge then Temperance then
[4:50] patience then godliness
[4:53] okay then you get up here he's asked you
[4:55] now to be perfect godliness Sons and
[4:58] Daughters of God that's right how many
[5:00] things I could say along that line let's
[5:02] turn to Ephesians 4 find out over here
[5:05] what in the book of Ephesians it says
[5:06] about this thing to about how we should
[5:08] do Ephesians 4 he goes to 4 and 12 and
[5:12] he gave some Apostles and some prophets
[5:14] remember last night don't try to take
[5:15] the other man's
[5:17] office and some evangelists and some
[5:19] pastors and some teachers for the
[5:21] perfecting of God he says no God don't
[5:24] need perfected that's right he's already
[5:26] perfect that's right does it read like
[5:29] that says no the Perfection of what
[5:33] Saints who are the Saints the Sanctified
[5:35] ones so we're already
[5:37] Sanctified you're already sealed in with
[5:40] God you you know and and for our our
[5:43] ones that haven't been here in this
[5:46] church we believe you get the Holy Ghost
[5:48] at
[5:49] Faith not up there at the top that's a
[5:52] refilling that's more of the Holy Ghost
[5:55] but faith is where you if you don't have
[5:57] Holy Ghost you don't know what God's
[5:58] going to give you right amen you got to
[6:01] have Godly virtue well to have Godly
[6:03] virtue you got to have God in you
[6:04] because it says right here perfecting of
[6:06] what
[6:07] Sinners it don't say Sinners it says
[6:10] perfecting of the
[6:13] Saints let me explain it this way just
[6:15] like I was telling them in Miami and
[6:16] I've told you before but let me tell you
[6:19] again when you're born again you get all
[6:22] the medication you need for your
[6:26] sickness remember I talking about the
[6:27] peill amen you get a pill from the
[6:30] doctor you get a capsule the doctor says
[6:33] this pill will take care of everything
[6:35] in your
[6:37] body and you go home and you tell all
[6:40] your neighbors and say oh this pill will
[6:41] take care of everything it's everything
[6:43] I need and you lay it on the kitchen
[6:45] counter and you leave it there you're
[6:48] going to die be sick and die yeah but
[6:52] the Cure is laying right there but it's
[6:54] encapsulated or it's or it's bound by
[6:57] what's on the outside
[6:59] the the plastic or the or the what you
[7:01] call the gelatin the gelatin around the
[7:04] outside right our sister's a nurse you
[7:05] ought to know that gelatin around here
[7:08] but inside's what's going to do you good
[7:10] but if you take that believe what's
[7:12] going to help you put it in your mouth
[7:14] it'll dissolve and what's on the inside
[7:16] is going to perfect
[7:19] you same thing with the gospel you're
[7:21] born again at Faith you've got the new
[7:23] birth you've got all these virtues
[7:25] potentially to work in your life amen
[7:28] that's right and if you die if you get
[7:31] born again today and die tomorrow you're
[7:32] going to be you're Eternal amen amen if
[7:36] you're born again now not justified not
[7:38] Sanctified but I'm talking about born
[7:40] again the old nature burn out God's
[7:43] nature put in you and it's you and God
[7:45] in there as persons amen that's the new
[7:48] birth it's not just a hope so or a wish
[7:51] so you're just as Eternal as God is but
[7:54] we're still alive the ones that are
[7:56] alive and have been born again for years
[7:58] months days whatever God's requiring
[8:01] that we add to our stature not statue
[8:06] right stature all right which is highest
[8:09] our growth development so God has given
[8:12] you all the
[8:13] provisions the guide has got everything
[8:16] ready but you got to say hey let's go I
[8:20] want to go hunting cuz he's going to ask
[8:21] you he said you ready to go that's what
[8:24] they tell me they'll come in there at
[8:25] 5:00 in the morning they'll go you ready
[8:27] to go you know what I got got to go out
[8:29] I got to unlock that door and I got to
[8:31] get my clothes on and I got to go but
[8:32] he's got all the provisions for the
[8:35] journey already on the horse or already
[8:37] in the truck or or in the four-wheeler
[8:39] or whatever you understand what I'm
[8:40] saying using natural illustrations here
[8:43] right but that's what God has give us
[8:45] with a new birth he's give us everything
[8:47] we need but we got to get up and go and
[8:50] say hey God I want to
[8:52] have the perfecting of the Saints that's
[8:55] what I want I want that to happen in my
[8:58] life
[8:59] I I'm not satisfied with just being born
[9:01] again that's cuz there's more and there
[9:03] should be a pull or aing inside uh you
[9:06] know babies are born babies and they're
[9:08] wonderful
[9:10] amen and and you know little Eli and my
[9:13] grandbaby 6 years old they're just
[9:16] wonderful but you [ __ ] them if you
[9:19] keep them at that age 5 years from now
[9:21] if he's still that age you've done
[9:22] something wrong no you feed him and he
[9:27] grows and grows and grows and grows and
[9:28] grows you want him to be an adult
[9:30] sometimes you know sometimes I'd love
[9:32] for Deana to be 6 years old and not not
[9:34] change but see I know that's that's
[9:36] hindering her not me it's hindering her
[9:38] yes and it's me as a as a terrible sight
[9:42] as a grandfather or father to want them
[9:44] to be that way stay that way you want
[9:46] them to grow up you want them to to get
[9:48] a job and get out of the house amen
[9:52] hallelujah and just come back and
[9:56] visit not listen not in Extended Stay
[10:03] mot for the perfecting of God no for the
[10:07] perfecting of Sinners
[10:09] no but for the perfecting of the Saints
[10:13] the Sanctified one see he goes right on
[10:15] in who are the Saints the Sanctified
[10:17] ones the one started from down here now
[10:20] I believe he's pointing right here right
[10:23] here yes down here right the ones that
[10:26] started at Fai all right I got to turn
[10:29] this thing on hang on AE hold on just a
[10:32] second what's the matter my tablet has
[10:35] been in Miami and it's just all yeah but
[10:39] anyway let's get through this I'll I'll
[10:41] make it move back and forth can you read
[10:43] that perfecting of the Saints for the
[10:45] working see it doesn't stop for the
[10:48] working of the ministry the ministry of
[10:50] Jesus Christ for the edifying of the
[10:52] body of Christ which is all of us all
[10:55] right for the edifying building it up
[10:57] edifying cuz remember what we said about
[10:58] virtue virtue is something that people
[11:00] draw from people draw that virtue from
[11:03] you you draw virtue from somebody else
[11:06] right okay till we all come to the what
[11:10] Unity of the faith One Faith one Lord
[11:12] one baptism and the knowledge of the Son
[11:15] of
[11:17] God and to the perfect man he's not
[11:19] finished man he's just heaping us on
[11:21] here in the book of Ephesians because
[11:22] you know what the people in the book of
[11:24] Ephesians they can handle it they were
[11:25] more mature they can understand what
[11:27] Paul was talking about all right to to
[11:30] the perfect man unto the Assurance oh my
[11:34] to the measure of the stature of the
[11:36] fullness of Christ perfect takes
[11:39] godliness amen you have to add to your
[11:42] faith godliness see you start off down
[11:45] here with virtue then you go to
[11:47] knowledge then Temperance patience now
[11:49] you're on godliness godliness oh my
[11:51] time's getting away but you know what
[11:52] godliness meant you sung the song to be
[11:54] like Jesus to be like Jesus on Earth I
[11:57] long to be like him all through life
[11:58] Journey from Earth to Glory I only ask
[12:00] to be like him so you add to your God
[12:02] add godliness now next is going to be
[12:04] brotherly kindness all right now
[12:08] look you said that's an easy one to me
[12:11] it's one of the hard it is the hardest
[12:12] one
[12:14] M if not it'd be down there below right
[12:18] it's right up there before God seals you
[12:21] in and adopts you into the body you got
[12:24] to be able to love your brother whether
[12:27] he hates your guts or not
[12:30] Jesus said the greatest commandment is
[12:31] to love your neighbor as you love
[12:33] yourself now he's talking about loving
[12:34] your neighbor the same as you love your
[12:36] own self that's right that's hard people
[12:39] that's hard that's hard that's going to
[12:41] be real
[12:43] hard cuz brother Bri says he does not
[12:45] spend a lot of time on godliness that's
[12:47] about all he spent on godliness then he
[12:49] goes right into brotherly kindness but
[12:51] now he spends a pretty good time on
[12:53] Godly I mean on brotherly kindness why
[12:56] it's very well needed that's right and
[12:58] that's that's our problem right it's
[13:01] brotherly kindness or we wouldn't act
[13:03] sometimes the way we do
[13:06] so read up read brotherly kindness in
[13:08] your statute of perfect man see what
[13:10] brother B says about it go ahead you
[13:12] know to me buing your neighbor is easier
[13:15] than brotherly kindness because brother
[13:18] and sister you know the closer you live
[13:21] with somebody the more you get to know
[13:23] them or dislike certain things but your
[13:25] neighbor yep you know you try to with
[13:29] your property what you would want him to
[13:31] do on his side and I think he says love
[13:34] them whether they love you or not see
[13:36] that's where that's the whole thing you
[13:39] got to love them whether they love you
[13:41] or not right so what it is it comes down
[13:45] to the to the meaning of it doesn't
[13:48] matter what anybody else thinks of you
[13:57] right but it's what you think of
[14:00] others it's not it's Jesus it didn't
[14:03] bother him for Kus and him to call him
[14:05] illegitimate or what didn't bother him a
[14:07] bit that didn't he didn't go off
[14:09] somewhere in pout like we do and say oh
[14:11] he called me Serpent seed or he called
[14:13] me the devil he called cus everybody was
[14:16] calling Jesus the devil they said he was
[14:17] the son of
[14:18] BS now he didn't jump up on his stump
[14:21] and say well bless God I you know no he
[14:24] knew who he was that's and when we get
[14:27] to where we know who we are a lot of
[14:30] these things are going to do just like
[14:31] that pyramid just like that dream of
[14:33] sister Shepherd that water is just going
[14:35] to run right off it run right by her
[14:37] feet and that trash just run right out
[14:39] of that dream didn't stick on her didn't
[14:42] stick on nothing it just run right out I
[14:45] was just listening to conferences and a
[14:48] lady at the end started speaking in
[14:49] tongues while he was still speaking he
[14:53] totally ignored it I mean it was like
[14:55] yes and then did you notice she kind of
[14:58] started shouting as she was speaking in
[15:00] tongues like that little devil was right
[15:03] trying to make disturb him sure he
[15:06] totally Ed it no well the spirit of the
[15:09] Prophet subject to the prophet so he
[15:11] knew that he knew that sure and you know
[15:13] what that could have been of God but
[15:15] that lady there's your power without
[15:18] character cuz she could speak in tongues
[15:21] and it be a true message from God but if
[15:25] she had the virtues it would have held
[15:27] her to after the service was over and
[15:30] and what was inside of her would have
[15:31] known but she but brother BR says
[15:33] they're just Pentecostal babies what
[15:35] you're a baby at Faith right and he
[15:38] allowed that to happen he didn't now he
[15:40] told one woman to sit down and shut up
[15:41] one time but say I believe he come to a
[15:44] place where he said that's enough of
[15:46] that right you're grieving the spirit
[15:49] amen all right and and she got more in
[15:50] herself remember she started fixing her
[15:52] hair up he said I noticed she started
[15:53] fixing everything you know she was
[15:55] making a show out of it right now if you
[15:57] make a show out of it that ain't of God
[16:00] all right but if it's of God you have to
[16:01] hold your peace until the right time the
[16:05] right order and if she would have been
[16:06] own up in the Statue of a perfect man
[16:08] she would have sat there but see they
[16:10] were all Pentecostal babies they didn't
[16:11] know nothing about virtue and all this
[16:13] temper patience go this whole world
[16:15] didn't know nothing about it till
[16:16] brother rown came sure Peter and them
[16:18] had it but Peter and them had a very
[16:20] small group of people to talk to brother
[16:23] Brown's speaking to the world he's
[16:25] trying to get a world not a world but a
[16:27] world of believers perfected so we can
[16:30] get to a body change cuz you're not
[16:31] going to get to a body change till that
[16:32] headstone com that's right there's no
[16:35] way nobody's ever took a body changeed
[16:36] except Jesus Christ a permanent body
[16:39] change amen Abraham's body was changed
[16:41] but he died lazarus's body was changed
[16:44] but he died everybody but Jesus's body
[16:47] was changed and he didn't die again so
[16:49] he's he's reached immortality so the
[16:51] only way for us to get it is for him to
[16:52] come back here like brother Dale's
[16:54] preaching now him not in a physical form
[16:57] but in a bride that's right and the
[16:58] bride's going to have to speak the brid
[17:00] one is going to have to bring this thing
[17:02] to pass okay all right let's
[17:04] go Lord bless
[17:07] you
