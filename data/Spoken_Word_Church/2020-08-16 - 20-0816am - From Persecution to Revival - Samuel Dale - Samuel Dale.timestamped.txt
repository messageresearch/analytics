[13:49] 59 isaiah 59
[13:52] so good to be here
[13:57] you know it's been quite a while and
[13:59] that when you miss services you know
[14:02] you we can always watch it on the
[14:03] internet but it's still not as
[14:05] i like being here and being in the
[14:06] services and things but
[14:08] we appreciate everything because it just
[14:11] all works for the glory of the lord and
[14:14] honor of the lord brings everything to
[14:15] the right place and
[14:17] he'll get the honor and glory out of it
[14:18] all right it gave us
[14:20] time to sit down and think about
[14:24] you know a lot about where we're at and
[14:26] the day that we're living and things and
[14:28] we'll try to cover a little bit
[14:30] of that today and just an idea you'll
[14:33] see what i'm talking about
[14:34] you know but just we want to thank
[14:36] everybody whether it be
[14:38] on the internet whether it be anywhere
[14:41] around the world we know they were
[14:44] praying for my wife and and everything
[14:47] because see i never was tested as being
[14:49] positive
[14:50] so i started out the the case we went
[14:52] together to
[14:54] then they run the test on us and she
[14:56] wound up being positive i wound up being
[14:58] negative
[14:59] so it's mine's been negative the whole
[15:01] time but i still was
[15:03] limited to being quarantined by uh being
[15:06] with her my
[15:07] uh doctor i talked to him and he asked
[15:09] was you know checking on me
[15:11] and he said you think you've been
[15:13] exposed i said
[15:15] well we've kind of been here in the
[15:17] house together for
[15:19] nearly two months you know a month at
[15:21] least so
[15:22] i think you can be exposed a lot to
[15:25] a lot of things you know because we
[15:27] didn't uh i didn't back
[15:29] up i we did just a little we
[15:32] you know uh pulled back done a few
[15:34] things but other than that forget it
[15:36] because
[15:37] i've always been one thing i'm not
[15:39] afraid of anything the devil can bring
[15:42] now i'm not challenging him i don't do
[15:45] that
[15:46] don't do that you might get in trouble
[15:48] but i do believe in just standing there
[15:50] on it and saying okay the lord take care
[15:52] of it
[15:54] just be positive about it and then if
[15:56] things goes wrong and everything gets
[15:57] shaky
[15:58] then you just keep that positive
[16:00] attitude to say bye stripes i'm healed
[16:03] so
[16:04] if i've got it i'm still okay because i
[16:06] got to god on my side to take care of
[16:08] all of it
[16:08] you know and lead me through but we just
[16:10] thank everybody
[16:12] around the world and everywhere that
[16:14] people are called and
[16:15] and everything and and committed their
[16:17] self to prayer and we just
[16:19] thank god for that and you just keep
[16:21] praying for my wife she still has
[16:23] problems with
[16:24] the congestion in and here that's
[16:26] evidently from the sinuses because
[16:28] so she had that before this ever started
[16:32] it's this thing was six months ago that
[16:34] she had that problem with that
[16:36] and you know if they would have just
[16:38] listened to her when they put her in the
[16:40] hospital
[16:41] uh things would have been a little
[16:42] different because they were running and
[16:44] checking on lungs and heart and things
[16:46] and she said but it's up here and they
[16:49] just bypassed it we didn't give her a
[16:50] thing they sent her home from the
[16:52] hospital with nothing
[16:53] this just turned her loose the next day
[16:55] well then the next time they went in
[16:56] finally they got enough of them together
[16:58] till they did at least give her some
[16:59] antibiotics
[17:01] to help her and i'm sure that that
[17:03] helped a lot on the doing
[17:04] but she kept still trying to tell them
[17:06] you know and they just
[17:08] they wouldn't do it and i believe she'd
[17:10] have been a whole lot quicker getting
[17:11] straightened out if they did just to
[17:13] listen to her a little bit but that's
[17:14] the way they are and that's their
[17:16] concern
[17:16] they said we're concerned with the major
[17:18] thing your lungs
[17:19] and your heart and said everything's
[17:21] perfect said you have no problems and
[17:24] they couldn't figure out how that she
[17:25] could be
[17:26] her um uh what do you call it you're
[17:29] not your blood pressure but where the
[17:32] oxygen level
[17:33] her oxygen level was greater than mine
[17:36] it would always be 95 96 even as much as
[17:39] 98
[17:40] you know in things that it would be and
[17:43] you know
[17:43] they couldn't figure that out because
[17:46] they thought well that's just
[17:47] you know it's supposed to at least be
[17:48] down some but see god was there
[17:51] taking care of it and you still remember
[17:54] because you still
[17:55] you know i thank god for it thank you
[17:58] for praying thank you
[18:00] thank the brothers here for ministering
[18:02] and taking over and
[18:03] and doing everything you know and and
[18:05] handling all of this church and keeping
[18:07] us running and
[18:08] even going i thoroughly enjoyed the
[18:10] services and things as a matter of fact
[18:12] i got one thought
[18:13] out of one and one out of another one
[18:15] and uh you know
[18:16] uh i'll be bringing these out to you

[19:04] i'm just saying this part now so you
[19:06] don't
[19:07] think that i'm picking on anybody or any
[19:09] thoughts but somebody had made a
[19:11] statement about said one brother said
[19:13] that
[19:13] that nobody being bribed wouldn't be
[19:16] affected by or wouldn't
[19:17] um be you know how the disease the virus

[19:51] his life and
[19:52] and try to make it you know if you want
[19:54] to get totally negative

[20:03] that you're not going to do it you thank
[20:06] god to take care of it i like what
[20:07] brother
[20:08] uh john martin said one time he said why
[20:10] not pray for
[20:12] to to keep away the sickness instead of
[20:14] praying after you get sick
[20:15] well that's good but that's you know i'm
[20:18] just that away i
[20:19] i'm saying you know satan is attacking
[20:23] the bride of christ as much as he can
[20:26] and see if you'll notice a lot of he's
[20:28] hit the ministers
[20:29] well see you know what that's doing he's
[20:31] trying to destroy that part
[20:33] and then get somebody to come along with
[20:35] a statement that makes others you know
[20:37] get down and out about their thinking
[20:38] about this that or the other
[20:40] well then so you you better think about

[22:32] grace we thank you for the opportunity
[22:34] of being here today
[22:36] and we pray that you would lord have the
[22:38] preeminence in each one of our hearts
[22:40] and lives
[22:41] bless each one bless the people out on
[22:43] the internet our ways and the things
[22:44] around the country
[22:46] and lord if they can see us back up here
[22:49] fighting for you lord and knowing that
[22:53] all things will work together it just we
[22:56] just have to wait it out sometime and
[22:57] just
[22:58] pray and see how you're going and what's
[23:00] going to take place
[23:01] so we pray that you would just guide us
[23:03] and lord and keep us

[23:12] of us all we love you and we thank you
[23:14] in jesus name amen
[23:20] there will be a kind of an odd way of
[23:22] going but i want to read this
[23:25] and uh it's an odd thing to use this
[23:27] scripture but then you'll see
[23:29] how it comes out to lord willing uh
[23:31] verse 19
[23:32] isaiah 59 19.
[23:36] so shall they fear the name of the lord
[23:38] from the west and his glory from the
[23:40] rising of the sun
[23:42] when the enemy shall come in like a
[23:44] flood the spirit of the lord
[23:47] will shall raise up a standard against
[23:49] him
[23:50] and the redeemer shall come to zion
[23:53] now if you go over in romans you'll find
[23:55] out it comes out of zion
[23:57] see here is tucson because it's looking
[24:00] forward
[24:01] to calvary out of zion is over in the
[24:04] new testament where it comes forth
[24:06] you know all right and and to them that
[24:09] turn from trend
[24:10] from transgressions in jacob says the
[24:13] lord
[24:14] as for me this is my covenant with them
[24:17] saith the lord
[24:18] my spirit that is upon thee and my words
[24:21] which i have put in thy mouth
[24:23] shall not depart out of thy mouth nor
[24:26] out of the mouth of thy seed
[24:29] nor out of the mouth of thy seeds seeds
[24:32] saith the lord from henceforth and
[24:34] forever you may be seated the lord add
[24:37] his blessing
[24:37] to the reading of the word
[24:42] but that old devil he does everything he
[24:45] can
[24:46] i thought about it sister my wife going
[24:49] they went and tested her four times you
[24:52] know
[24:52] each time it would be three times was
[24:54] positive
[24:55] the last one had to come forth and be in
[24:57] the negative where sister rebecca went
[24:59] through i think four times i know she
[25:01] did three
[25:02] or four times and then it comes out well
[25:05] uh you know you can get down and out
[25:07] about that and say well
[25:09] what was this what was that what are you
[25:10] worried about
[25:12] you come out of it main thing is get it
[25:15] settled and that's done and finished and
[25:16] you know
[25:17] and uh you say are you um immune to
[25:21] sicknesses like that no but in god we're
[25:24] immune to all things
[25:26] and that's what i was not throwing no
[25:27] stones at nobody that somebody thinks
[25:29] that the bride won't be
[25:30] doing well that's going to be kind of
[25:32] contrary to the way we're going to be
[25:33] speaking today
[25:34] so we're going to be talking about
[25:36] persecution
[25:38] not tribulation now remember this and
[25:41] we'll
[25:42] remark over and over we do not the
[25:44] prophet did not believe the bride of
[25:46] christ would go through the tribulation
[25:49] persecutions yes troubles and heartaches
[25:52] and trials yes
[25:53] but not through the tribulation uh if
[25:56] you want these i've got plenty of them
[25:57] laying on the desk
[25:58] but he said on one of them he said you
[26:00] see there he said
[26:02] um the sixth seal
[26:05] he said that's the tribulation he said
[26:07] in the sixth seal it's all way on over
[26:09] after the rapture of the bride
[26:11] she's done gone when the tribulation
[26:14] comes in so it'd be kind of hard to put
[26:15] the bride into the tribulation
[26:17] now persecutions persecution is a part
[26:19] of a christian's life
[26:22] it's not to be that we're supposed to be
[26:24] put into this world
[26:26] to be uh not to have troubles and things
[26:29] amen and no it's not that away those
[26:33] things are part of a christian's life
[26:36] and and really that's why i said we can
[26:38] stand and pray really do you
[26:40] realize we're listening last night i
[26:42] guess not for the last one
[26:44] do you realize that it's an honor
[26:50] for god to be able to tell the devil
[26:57] come on satan have you considered my
[26:59] servant zach
[27:02] he said yeah but he ain't supposed to
[27:03] get sick now show me that in the bible
[27:06] many are the afflictions of the
[27:07] righteous but the lord leadeth out of
[27:09] them all
[27:10] right you say what but but but now
[27:14] are you saying that sickness is a is of
[27:16] god no
[27:17] it's permitted permitted to bring us to
[27:21] the position
[27:22] but in order to bring us to the position
[27:24] of faith
[27:25] that we know and realize we get through
[27:27] it
[27:29] i mean a common thing that we used to
[27:31] think about is to say it
[27:32] we used to think about a common cold
[27:34] with nothing but you look at it now and
[27:36] you call it a common cold you call it a
[27:38] a virus now and it's affecting the whole
[27:40] world
[27:42] well but you see god's right in the
[27:45] midst of it all
[27:46] right let's don't lose faith
[27:49] let's glory into seeing what not the
[27:51] glory that we're sick i never say god
[27:53] thank you for making me sick
[27:55] i said god thank you for thanking enough
[27:57] of me
[27:58] to allow these things to come on me
[28:00] because the prophet said
[28:02] satan cannot put on you nothing unless
[28:05] god allows it
[28:08] well you mean death heartache sorrow
[28:10] trouble
[28:12] yeah that's right
[28:16] are you going to argue with the prophet
[28:18] don't argue with the bible
[28:20] no well see we don't glory in sickness
[28:23] we glory in the savior
[28:26] this is displaying his attributes if we
[28:29] wasn't sick his attributes of healer
[28:31] would not be displayed
[28:33] well see we could get on that and just
[28:37] keep going okay
[28:38] all right let's see if i can get back on
[28:40] where i'm going
[28:42] wade made a statement here not too few
[28:46] weeks ago or something he was talking
[28:48] and uh he was talking about and showing
[28:50] you remember how that
[28:52] uh a church age would come forth
[28:55] a messenger would come and the things
[28:57] you know and why that would be
[28:59] and that it would would actually always
[29:02] be because of people falling away
[29:05] right people falling away
[29:09] then persecution
[29:12] strikes the church drives her to the
[29:15] position
[29:16] that she turns to god each church age is
[29:19] at a white sea
[29:21] then at the ending of all of that up
[29:23] then a revival comes because
[29:27] of those things each church age then had
[29:30] a revival see
[29:31] martin luther when that aids been run
[29:33] down he ran out there with that message
[29:35] of the just shall live by faith
[29:37] and revival started
[29:40] well all right then i think
[29:45] that the way it is is why because we'll
[29:48] read one in a minute what the prophet
[29:49] said
[29:49] but see people reject the word of god
[29:54] all right they get all tied up
[29:57] you think about where we're living now
[29:59] because we're not back there with
[30:00] lutheran wesleyan we're living here
[30:02] and you think of how that what things
[30:03] have happened in the past
[30:05] year you say well all i can think about
[30:07] is a virus you don't think about it
[30:09] like a year ago that the people of this
[30:11] message began to just start falling away
[30:15] large groups large amounts of people
[30:19] that was in the message ministers that
[30:20] have been preaching 30 40 years or more
[30:23] and all at once they just fallen away
[30:25] turning to
[30:26] to all kind of doctrines and ideas amen
[30:30] well then here come a plague right
[30:35] brother randall said they turned down my
[30:37] message he said then the plagues will
[30:39] fall
[30:42] he said famine will come amen amen
[30:45] and he said not necessarily for the food
[30:49] but said for the hearing then he goes on
[30:51] and says man physical too
[30:53] before the hearing of god's word well
[30:56] now you look at it
[30:59] i i'm trying to make this i mentioned it
[31:02] a few times in doing this hitting it in
[31:04] the services
[31:06] to get you to think but you think about
[31:09] where we are now and where we've been
[31:11] and what's been taking place
[31:16] well see then what do you expect i
[31:17] expect a revival
[31:20] for the bride of christ to turn back to
[31:22] god and realize that hey wait a minute
[31:25] wait a minute these things are happening
[31:29] out here
[31:32] i mean did you ever think about that you
[31:33] would come we uh you know we used to
[31:36] we talked about it some and terence and
[31:38] us was right another day talking about
[31:40] it and
[31:40] and you just wonder well hey what's
[31:45] you know what do you expect next
[31:49] that's right hey don't tell him what's
[31:50] going to come next
[31:53] i'm not a doomsday gloomy preacher i'm
[31:56] just
[31:56] telling the truth i've always been i
[31:59] guess you call it a little optimistic
[32:01] and maybe very little pot pessimistic
[32:04] but
[32:05] i'm positive about everything but i know
[32:07] for sure things are going to take place
[32:11] do you expect god to pour yeah because
[32:14] the people have turned him down
[32:16] that's what your prophet will read what
[32:17] he said
[32:21] see when the children of israel
[32:24] they went down into egypt you realize
[32:26] they went into egypt as victorious
[32:28] people
[32:30] they never went into egypt into bondage
[32:34] they went in there and for probably uh
[32:37] for those 400 years if they were there
[32:39] probably two or three hundred years they
[32:41] were the victorious
[32:43] children of israel living in in goshen
[32:46] and everything running so wonderful then
[32:48] they started turning away from god
[32:52] then they wound up being into slavery
[32:57] right they didn't go down there as
[32:58] slaves study a little bit read your
[33:01] bible
[33:02] that's 400 years down there
[33:05] and probably two or three hundred years
[33:07] of that they were victorious people
[33:11] until ramesses come off the scene and
[33:13] this come off the scene i can't never
[33:14] keep up with
[33:15] those guys are but you know what i'm
[33:17] talking about
[33:19] but listen see then
[33:24] when the people turn away
[33:27] from god then
[33:31] it's automatically going to come a
[33:32] persecution
[33:37] i know i've fought this ever since i've
[33:38] been in the message i know the prophet i
[33:41] got them laying at the house so if you
[33:42] want to read them i got a lot of them
[33:43] laying in there if you want to read them
[33:45] i try to make myself straight and honest
[33:47] oh the bride ain't going to go through
[33:49] no persecution
[33:50] right ain't going through tribulation
[33:52] but she's going through persecution
[33:55] that's right why
[33:58] because the bible said that's right amen
[34:02] do you realize what isaiah was saying
[34:07] you realize what's saying right there
[34:11] it brags on and shows up
[34:15] to being you know when the enemy comes
[34:18] in like a flood the spirit of the lord
[34:19] is going to read up a standard what do
[34:21] you realize that means
[34:22] that the enemy is going to come
[34:25] amen right
[34:29] it'll come to zion okay we'll get to
[34:30] jeremiah in a few minutes
[34:32] where he said you've turned down god and
[34:34] done this
[34:35] and he said you've got a hoarse forehead
[34:41] boy i'll tell you what so brother ain't
[34:42] got no horse forehead i'm proud of jesus
[34:44] christ
[34:45] ain't no persecution you just you just
[34:48] don't preach it right and you
[34:49] well okay go somewhere else find
[34:51] something else
[34:52] because we're running out of time folks
[34:55] you can bank on one thing
[34:57] we're running out of time all right see
[35:02] you
[35:03] if it's another 50 years we'd be running
[35:05] out of time
[35:08] i don't think many of you and me going
[35:10] to make it 50 years
[35:12] in natural life so let's don't get
[35:15] concerned
[35:16] about it well see i i've had i've talked
[35:19] to the church here i've tried to preach
[35:20] it for years
[35:21] that i believe in the the bride coming
[35:24] through persecution
[35:26] because the brother the prophet said the
[35:28] bride is as strong as that persecution
[35:30] amen that's right but you don't want it
[35:33] that way
[35:34] oh you want a glorious all right that's
[35:37] the reason i'm trying to take this day
[35:38] to
[35:39] announce this part you think about where
[35:41] we are now
[35:44] you remember two or three months ago
[35:46] when you could not go to church
[35:52] oh yeah we could have done yo yo okay yo
[35:54] yo yo you can't you'll go ahead
[35:58] i said you say well oh and
[36:01] and look what you just think about
[36:07] i mean some of you coming and talking
[36:09] about we're all talking about
[36:10] how that we stayed at home for the first
[36:13] time in our christian experience
[36:16] we could not go to church
[36:19] you realize a pen stroke and we would
[36:22] have been totally put out
[36:23] you realized and i'm not far trump
[36:25] against trump i don't worry about it
[36:27] all right that's right
[36:30] but you see if he hadn't come up with
[36:32] the point of saying hey if you're going
[36:34] to keep the beer joints and the liquor
[36:35] joints and the
[36:36] food and everything open we're going to
[36:38] keep the church open amen well
[36:40] he may not be no good he may be this but
[36:43] he may get eternal life for making that
[36:45] one statement too
[36:47] i'm not for him or against him or for
[36:49] this other man and
[36:50] the woman he's got running with him or
[36:52] whatever it's all got to be there
[36:55] the bible says i put in kings i take out
[36:58] kings
[37:00] it ain't nothing to me and you you can
[37:01] go and vote all you want to
[37:04] when i found out that we voted and put
[37:06] john f kennedy in office i quit voting
[37:08] because when we voted and put a catholic
[37:10] in
[37:13] i didn't vote no more and i didn't want
[37:16] to help it
[37:19] you realize a terrorist terrence he's he
[37:22] he gets his carnal point in sometimes
[37:24] but he's straight but
[37:25] you realize that we put in the office
[37:29] what the prophet said
[37:33] i don't care if you vote for trump or or
[37:36] i don't know what his name
[37:37] is either one of them you're going to
[37:39] put in the office
[37:42] your vote is going to put in the office
[37:45] a crook right
[37:49] right that's both sides nothing
[37:53] right you're gonna you're gonna vote it
[37:57] in
[38:00] he said the only thing we could ever
[38:01] done we should have done that you
[38:02] realize back when
[38:04] when gold was 35 an ounce if we'd have
[38:06] thought what brother branham said
[38:08] he said the church is going to get all
[38:10] the wealth of the gold and everything
[38:11] you know doing all this and the other
[38:13] and it's 35 an ounce
[38:16] what is it now fifteen hundred dollars
[38:18] an ounce or something
[38:20] i mean i don't even know because i ain't
[38:21] got nothing to keep up with
[38:23] i i count i got two or three pennies and
[38:25] that's it i mean i ain't got
[38:27] you know but the point is to look at
[38:29] what we're doing we vote in the people
[38:36] that the prophet said this is what would
[38:38] happen
[38:40] okay listen because that's what we want
[38:43] to get to
[38:44] we want to get to something just think
[38:45] about a point now
[38:48] my whole point is way based upon one
[38:51] thing
[38:52] now remember brother branham says
[38:56] over over over how many times
[39:00] the bride does not go through the
[39:02] tribulation
[39:03] amen now if you want a bunch of them
[39:06] i'll be glad to give it to you i got one
[39:08] in here in a minute
[39:09] uh let's see number four
[39:13] how can i overcome where he says the
[39:15] bride does not
[39:16] that's just one i just wrote it off and
[39:18] you're to know it
[39:19] don't don't study the message me
[39:24] the bride does not go through the
[39:26] tribulation because she's not
[39:27] got anything to be be purged of that she
[39:30] gets rid of it that's why we're here now
[39:32] to get rid of these things
[39:34] all right and see then but the bride has
[39:38] always been a hunted and persecuted a
[39:41] little group of people
[39:42] it's always been that right they've
[39:45] never been to people
[39:47] if there was in the church you can
[39:49] figure one thing for sure they were the
[39:51] crooks
[39:53] maybe the wrong way to say it but you
[39:56] know
[39:57] if you if you was able to control the
[39:59] world
[40:01] you got a problem and that's what we're
[40:03] gonna strike in just a minute so we get
[40:05] to the point
[40:05] all right but this let's go on see when
[40:08] people turn down the word
[40:10] now this is my point
[40:13] when they turn down the word of god
[40:18] all right back up year or two
[40:22] and look what's happened amen
[40:25] if you can't see that then you're blind
[40:27] as a bat and it don't matter anyway
[40:29] to see how the people of this message
[40:31] have turned against brother brown's
[40:32] message
[40:37] that's what i told you there was enough
[40:39] all of us
[40:40] you know hard heads back there in the
[40:42] 70s and things
[40:43] that when they come out with that about
[40:44] brother brown and we had the wrong dates
[40:46] out there in arizona you know
[40:47] um in you know colorado or whatever when
[40:50] he was out there with it and they
[40:51] claim he had the wrong dates well we
[40:53] faced that in 1970
[40:54] but there was enough old heads until
[40:56] they said forget it we don't care what
[40:58] his dates are
[40:59] in time he brought us to christ which is
[41:01] the opening of god's word
[41:05] but now you don't have them to stand up
[41:06] for that
[41:09] well they started hunting something else
[41:11] just like one brother came here
[41:12] wonderful brother good little brother
[41:14] he came here probably his second sermon
[41:16] or something
[41:17] and you know and he preached wonderful
[41:20] and glory hallelujah
[41:22] and a month later
[41:25] he was denying the things the prophet
[41:27] taught
[41:28] because he found out there's a date
[41:29] different
[41:32] if that's all it takes you can find it
[41:37] because that brother said brother
[41:40] branham said if you see me off on one
[41:41] thing
[41:46] he said then you tap me off on
[41:47] everything well okay brother brandon was
[41:49] off on the white horse rider
[41:50] so let's go home let's eat drink and be
[41:53] married and get out of this junk
[41:55] no light had never shined upon that so
[41:59] there was no way nobody could judge it
[42:01] all right come on
[42:05] but you see the thing of what i want you
[42:06] to think about
[42:09] think about the order of events when
[42:12] people reject the word
[42:17] all right automatically persecution
[42:20] comes because brother branham says
[42:22] god goes out
[42:26] i get time to read it don't do it this
[42:27] evening all
[42:33] when the people get to to turning that
[42:35] down the word
[42:36] see then they start a little group of
[42:39] people always raises up
[42:41] and starts crying out for deliverance
[42:43] it's been that way in every church age
[42:46] to crying out for deliverance god would
[42:49] answer that with the next message that
[42:51] was
[42:52] to come see
[42:55] then what are you expecting
[42:59] you say yeah but that brother dale you
[43:00] just make you make the people of this
[43:02] message now
[43:03] i'm trying to tell the truth did it
[43:05] happen amen
[43:06] has it happened amen that's right would
[43:09] you ever thought about all the people
[43:11] that's turned against this message
[43:13] the name brands
[43:16] would you ever thought they would have
[43:18] done the way they've done no
[43:25] and poor old people gets caught
[43:29] i don't blame the people i blame the
[43:30] preachers
[43:32] the preachers are once carrying away
[43:35] well see jeremiah says you wound up with
[43:37] a horse forehead
[43:38] you know what a forehead is a
[43:41] denominational thinking person
[43:48] that's what it is a denominational
[43:49] thinking person a jezebel religion
[43:52] because that's where it comes from
[43:55] all right but listen but when the people
[43:58] begin to cry out for deliverance
[44:02] now look at the children of israel they
[44:04] said they were victorious people for a
[44:06] long time
[44:07] but then they begin to dally around and
[44:10] getting tied up and getting into the
[44:12] world and getting into the
[44:13] the systems and all and they begin to
[44:15] fall away from the word of god
[44:18] as they did then god began to make
[44:20] preparation
[44:22] to put him into a persecution
[44:25] because what else could he do
[44:29] you're going to blame god for it no and
[44:31] what else can he do
[44:34] you realize he's bringing the
[44:35] persecution to save us
[44:39] come on that's the way i think i'm sorry
[44:42] he's bringing the tribulation upon i
[44:44] mean persecution upon us
[44:45] i use that word tribulation just
[44:47] remember what i said the prophet taught
[44:49] it we believe it
[44:50] the bride don't go through the
[44:51] tribulation because ain't nothing to be
[44:53] purged for
[44:54] all right but see persecution always
[44:57] comes
[44:59] the prophet said it brings strength to
[45:01] the bride
[45:04] brother branham will say things like
[45:05] this he said god wants to prove to satan
[45:08] that his little bride won't fall like
[45:09] eve did
[45:11] so he allows these things to come on us
[45:19] he allows these things to take place all
[45:22] right
[45:23] but follow me now
[45:28] but i i'd brother dale i don't i don't
[45:29] believe i know the quotes i don't mean i
[45:31] know
[45:32] all of them i'm not saying that that's
[45:33] junk i'm saying it like this i've
[45:35] studied this message for 50 years
[45:39] out of 50 years of studying something
[45:40] you ought to know a little bit
[45:43] well i didn't have to go run up a whole
[45:44] lot of quotes when i got to considering
[45:46] these things
[45:47] because i already had them wrote down
[45:50] because i've always preached it this way
[45:52] i've always preached that the bride
[45:55] turns down the word the bride
[45:57] oh no that's them denominations turn
[45:59] down the word
[46:01] now the bride gets tied up with the
[46:03] world
[46:04] and the systems of things and goes away
[46:07] from the word of god
[46:09] the bride was the one and i've argued
[46:12] with ministers from this pulpit about it
[46:15] the bride is the one that went down to
[46:17] narcia
[46:20] what your prophet said she had no right
[46:22] to go
[46:23] they went no but but brother dale you
[46:25] don't understand it wasn't the bride
[46:28] will you tr argue with your prophet then
[46:32] because you ain't going to take what i
[46:33] say and you won't listen to this part
[46:35] there's people on the internet right
[46:36] here probably are sitting there saying i
[46:38] tried to tell him out years ago
[46:41] he still believes you better believe i
[46:42] still believe it
[46:45] amen and i'm praying for god to send it
[46:48] i preached a message
[46:50] persecution why
[46:53] we must have it
[46:58] amen because it's going to drive us to
[47:00] our knees we're going to get rid of
[47:02] ourselves
[47:03] one way or the other god's going to be
[47:05] victorious if he has to bring us down to
[47:07] our knees and crawling
[47:08] to beg him to get everything straight
[47:11] amen
[47:13] are you going to talk to him about it
[47:14] and tell him he's wrong help yourself
[47:18] all right but listen there's going to
[47:22] come a persecution
[47:24] on the bride we know it'll come on the
[47:27] foolish virgins and the things like that
[47:30] we know it'll come on the jews the 144
[47:34] thousand the fifth sealed jews and the
[47:36] things
[47:36] are in persecutions and things and they
[47:38] wind up then people wind up going into
[47:40] the tribulation but
[47:42] the bride of christ don't go to the
[47:43] tribulation she goes to glory
[47:50] and i'm choosing the time to preach on
[47:52] it
[47:54] because to realize and try to knock the
[47:56] little things into our heads to think as
[47:58] i said a moment ago
[48:00] who would ever thought three or four
[48:01] months ago didn't you get hungry for the
[48:04] word
[48:06] didn't you get hungry for coming to
[48:07] church i did
[48:11] we was doing good we were still using
[48:14] the devil in our using the devil's
[48:16] equipments and the things like that to
[48:17] get the message out to the people
[48:19] but that didn't satisfy it to me i want
[48:21] to stand up in the church and declare
[48:23] jesus christ to be the same yesterday
[48:25] today and forever
[48:26] and tell the devil to go hide
[48:30] but i ain't going to argue with him i
[48:32] ain't going to challenge him i ain't
[48:33] going to do no
[48:34] i'm going to try to preach the truth
[48:35] because that's all i've ever done
[48:40] but to look at it the way it's supposed
[48:42] to be see
[48:44] you're thinking that i'm looking at it
[48:45] as a doomsday persecution
[48:47] but remember the persecution comes but
[48:50] remember what follows the persecution
[48:53] amen it's a revival
[48:59] because god always comes on the scene
[49:02] every church age he would do it they
[49:05] would get away from the word of god he
[49:07] would send a pr
[49:08] a messenger amen and they'd bring the
[49:11] message
[49:12] and the people would start rejoicing and
[49:13] a revival would strike
[49:20] well it ain't trying to see how mean we
[49:24] can get where god can send a revival i
[49:26] mean
[49:26] ain't no preaching like that but it's
[49:28] better than what most people preach
[49:30] you know at least it's sensible but
[49:33] listen let's just read a few
[49:35] because that's what i want us to do i
[49:36] want us to to just think about these and
[49:38] we'll take it this season i know we
[49:40] won't get through so
[49:41] we'll go so far and we'll quit and go
[49:43] this evening
[49:44] and uh go ahead with number
[49:48] one let's start from just read jeremiah
[49:53] and just remember what it says lift up
[49:56] thine eyes
[49:57] unto thy high places this is jeremiah 3
[50:00] 2 and 3. and see where thou hast not
[50:04] see where thou hast not been lined with
[50:07] in the ways hast thou set for them as
[50:12] the arabian in the
[50:14] wilderness and thou hast polluted the
[50:16] land with the whoredoms
[50:18] thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness
[50:20] now this is
[50:21] israel we know the natural that's a type
[50:25] of the bride of christ
[50:28] well you don't know you don't know okay
[50:31] now watch what he says therefore the
[50:33] showers have been withholding
[50:40] if you think it's just for for all these
[50:41] other then i thought we were
[50:43] okay let's finish up what we're talking
[50:45] about therefore the showers have been
[50:47] withholding
[50:48] and there has been no latter rain
[50:52] a lot of rain that doesn't concern
[50:53] nobody but the bride of christ
[50:56] come on we're going to change it in just
[50:57] a minute because there has been no
[50:59] revival right what's the difference in
[51:00] latter rain and revival
[51:03] it's the same wording same thoughts as
[51:05] implied
[51:06] latter rain is a revival there's been no
[51:09] revival why
[51:12] and thou hast a forehead that
[51:14] refuses to be ashamed
[51:19] brother dale ain't got no horse forehead
[51:22] i i've got the mind of christ
[51:26] yeah i'll remind you in a different way
[51:30] than to preach to your heart about it i
[51:31] remember
[51:32] i mean remind you of one thing a few
[51:34] months ago you weren't able to come to
[51:36] church you had to be hand-picked even
[51:38] still on that basis
[51:39] of picking and choosing who's getting to
[51:40] come to church because the government
[51:42] has set it up that way
[51:48] what do you think they're going to do
[51:51] you realize
[51:51] as i said a while ago a stroke of the
[51:54] pen
[51:56] they stopped us from having church
[51:59] something that i'd never thought of in
[52:01] my life
[52:04] hey i'm pretty smart
[52:08] i ain't that smart i mean that is a joke
[52:12] no
[52:13] he's in life but i mean it is a joke
[52:15] because that
[52:18] whoever thought about what would take
[52:19] place
[52:22] i've studied this message for 50 years
[52:25] and argued and fussed with people about
[52:27] the persecution
[52:28] points and the thoughts and things for
[52:30] 30 to 40 years
[52:35] trying to figure out how is this going
[52:38] to take place
[52:40] run around and say something here and
[52:41] then he'll say something there
[52:46] and he'll say now this guy and he'll say
[52:49] that's that says the lord
[52:51] the minute he'll say something that
[52:52] sounds like totally contrary
[52:59] see i wonder did god show him everything
[53:03] right when he gets to the point one time
[53:07] he said i'm presuming
[53:08] he said now listen i'm not prophesying
[53:10] i'm presuming
[53:17] i'm not saying he didn't know what he's
[53:18] talking about i'm wondering how much he
[53:20] did know
[53:23] when he made that statement there years
[53:25] ago i mean it struck me
[53:26] what he said one day it'll come he said
[53:28] black and white are dying
[53:29] fighting again and die like flies well i
[53:33] thought that
[53:35] the next message he said that was my
[53:37] idea
[53:39] right but what are they doing now with
[53:42] all of this
[53:43] riots and the things
[53:48] he could have been looking at a whole
[53:49] lot more than what we think because i
[53:51] remember when he said on the sixth seal
[53:52] you remember that
[53:53] he's on the sixth hill he said i had to
[53:55] go outside i cannot
[53:57] he said i cannot tell them that lord
[54:00] it's in the sixth seal something that he
[54:03] could not tell the bride of christ
[54:11] persecutions though
[54:14] we don't want persecutions
[54:18] well what if that's part of a christian
[54:22] life
[54:24] you don't want it well no we don't want
[54:28] to dig it up
[54:28] no we don't get in front of the train
[54:30] now and holler to the train hey i'm
[54:31] going to stand here
[54:36] no
[54:38] we don't do like that we just face
[54:40] things straight up as they are
[54:42] and realize right where we're standing
[54:45] you tell me right now
[54:47] you didn't see me run out here three
[54:49] months ago and say but i'll tell you
[54:52] what so we gonna challenge the world
[54:54] because we're gonna have services
[54:56] every day of the week i wanted to
[55:01] when they said we couldn't do this
[55:03] couldn't do that but it's in groups and
[55:04] different things
[55:04] i wanted to say y'all forget it we're
[55:08] going to have
[55:08] seven days of the week services every
[55:11] day
[55:12] we're going to challenge the government
[55:16] brother branham never challenged it
[55:24] he had to abide by what they were doing
[55:26] remember it cost him about 40 something
[55:28] thousand dollars
[55:29] for them to pay off that debt that they
[55:30] demanded on that when he said i don't
[55:33] owe them one
[55:34] dime he said i'm not going to pay it
[55:37] brother got what him told him and then
[55:39] you won't be able to travel or do
[55:41] nothing
[55:42] see i knew that i could holler out and
[55:44] scream here and say we're going to fight
[55:46] this well some of you would come into
[55:48] services and we'd fight it
[55:49] but what good would it do
[55:53] i said okay we'll just abide for a while
[55:56] you remember when i made the statement
[55:57] this is not
[56:01] the end of all things it's just the
[56:03] beginning of the end
[56:05] well i hope you see today one thing if
[56:07] we can get to it
[56:09] do you realize we're right here
[56:12] facing a stroke of the pen
[56:18] and you've got your jews and your
[56:21] catholics coming together for a covenant
[56:26] that the bible says will take place
[56:30] all it takes is stroke of a pen how
[56:32] close are we to it
[56:37] because that's one thing that hit me
[56:39] real hard to think about
[56:42] i'm sorry i'm just human
[56:46] when brother branham would talk about
[56:47] and say that they'll pay off our nice
[56:50] our national debt
[56:57] see i looked at the national debt of the
[56:59] church
[57:01] dummy i was looking at it because
[57:04] they're going to pay off the church is
[57:05] dead
[57:06] they're not going to pay off the
[57:07] churches dead church don't have no debt
[57:12] don't pay off the world systems
[57:16] don't pay off the world national debt
[57:20] then it'll go to the point
[57:23] of the church
[57:26] come on we'll follow brother branham
[57:31] if we're not looking at things and
[57:33] trying to keep it in a line we're
[57:35] looking at it what we think it is we
[57:36] don't want to be in no persecution we
[57:38] don't want no troubles brother dale we
[57:40] don't want none of this
[57:46] where are we going but he says
[57:51] there's a persecution coming
[57:54] he said yeah but now brother dale that's
[57:55] what i mean i know that's that's for the
[57:57] foolish virgins
[57:58] and that's the jews and that's them it
[57:59] ain't for us well okay okay
[58:02] then just go to sleep okay
[58:06] go to number two which is jezebel
[58:10] religion and i would invite you to read
[58:12] or
[58:12] listen to the tape jezebel religion
[58:15] it will be a great eye-opening thing all
[58:18] the way through
[58:19] and many many things that the prophet
[58:21] said now listen
[58:23] and when ahab was on the throne you say
[58:24] he's on the throne
[58:26] that's right but jezebel was the head
[58:28] behind that throne
[58:29] she was the one that done the leading
[58:33] look what she took the very laws of the
[58:35] land and twisted them around
[58:38] and for her own gain and for
[58:41] greed and made ahab do it
[58:45] now are you thinking about what they've
[58:48] done
[58:50] they've took the laws of the land and
[58:53] twisted it and pulled it and
[58:55] i've told you over and over
[59:00] you cannot put a church in this town
[59:04] without permission from one of the
[59:07] established churches
[59:08] in this city
[59:13] you want to talk to somebody walk across
[59:15] the street and ask the man over there
[59:16] that that time was assistant mayor
[59:18] and he was trying to get his shirts
[59:20] doing
[59:23] he was a baptist the baptist wouldn't
[59:25] have him didn't like him
[59:26] he had to go to back here to the church
[59:28] of god or something over on the backside
[59:30] of town
[59:31] and get them to okay that he could put
[59:33] up a church
[59:37] that's right here you better check your
[59:40] little charter things where you signed
[59:42] in these communities when you bought
[59:43] your home
[59:44] because if you'll read in there you'll
[59:46] find out after a while it says
[59:47] you cannot have service without it you
[59:50] know
[59:51] of some more no more than five people or
[59:54] something
[59:56] but you don't look at that oh brother
[59:58] dale he just
[1:00:01] go look go find out
[1:00:07] huh but look because she was married to
[1:00:10] him i
[1:00:11] twisted him around for her own gain and
[1:00:13] for greed and mayday have do it because
[1:00:15] she was married to him
[1:00:17] and that's the way with our leader
[1:00:20] today i don't say
[1:00:24] he isn't a nice man but look
[1:00:27] what's behind him look at your dates
[1:00:31] what is it yeah kennedy because it's
[1:00:34] 1961
[1:00:35] today
[1:00:40] but look what's behind him the harlot
[1:00:43] the very thing that we run here to be to
[1:00:46] america far in order to come over here
[1:00:48] to get away from it
[1:00:49] and the very principles that america has
[1:00:51] built upon we by our own free
[1:00:53] choosing elected a thing like that
[1:00:58] how many of you voted for john f kennedy
[1:01:00] don't raise your hand
[1:01:01] we ain't gonna zoom in around anyway but
[1:01:03] i'll put mine up cause i did i said
[1:01:05] that's the last time i voted
[1:01:10] then i did find out it was a pretty good
[1:01:12] thing because you know about that times
[1:01:14] where you found out you
[1:01:15] if you voted for one you're just voting
[1:01:16] for the other
[1:01:19] that's how crooked it was then now look
[1:01:23] we buy our own free choosing we buy our
[1:01:26] own preacher
[1:01:26] elected a thing like that now you see
[1:01:28] why my voice
[1:01:29] is going to be stopped pretty soon
[1:01:33] somebody's going to know yes why
[1:01:36] revelations 2 20. because it's a
[1:01:39] prophetess in the things he called
[1:01:40] herself a prophetess
[1:01:43] you just watch the wave of sin happening
[1:01:46] now
[1:01:47] get your point of what i'm talking about
[1:01:49] what causes it to happen
[1:01:51] what brings persecution the wave of sin
[1:01:53] okay
[1:01:54] are you listening you watch the corps go
[1:01:56] plum to the core
[1:01:58] you watch modernistic watch ungodly
[1:02:01] things happen
[1:02:02] in the churches and finally there will
[1:02:05] come a persecution
[1:02:07] the bible says so thus saith
[1:02:10] the lord certainly there will be
[1:02:16] okay come on i'm gonna get you off the
[1:02:18] hook
[1:02:19] this does say if the lord it's gonna be
[1:02:20] for the foolish virgins that says the
[1:02:22] lord is gonna be for them but it does
[1:02:23] say the lord's gonna be for the bride
[1:02:25] too
[1:02:26] because the rest of them don't need it
[1:02:28] it's no problem
[1:02:30] all right let's go ahead so there's
[1:02:32] gonna be a persecution
[1:02:34] okay go up to paragraph 97 which was
[1:02:38] there you go see what happened after
[1:02:40] that after the attack his voice became
[1:02:42] quiet
[1:02:42] nobody heard him no more god called him
[1:02:45] off the scene
[1:02:45] said elijah you've done made your
[1:02:47] message known to all of israel
[1:02:50] they know it now come up here in the
[1:02:52] wilderness
[1:02:53] get away from them separate yourself
[1:02:56] because i'm going to do something i'm
[1:02:59] going to show them what it is to turn my
[1:03:02] message
[1:03:02] down what said in war famine starvation
[1:03:08] what followed his message back there of
[1:03:10] the elijah
[1:03:12] war famine starvation what struck when
[1:03:15] the prophet
[1:03:16] came people turned down his message what
[1:03:19] stroke
[1:03:22] all kind of depressions all over the 30s
[1:03:24] which would be a little bit prior to
[1:03:25] brother browning but it was still in
[1:03:27] the bases of it you had your
[1:03:32] great depression look what's happening
[1:03:35] all down through there
[1:03:37] see thus saith the holy spirit watch
[1:03:41] what's coming
[1:03:42] watch what's going to follow there was a
[1:03:44] famine
[1:03:45] there will be a famine oh maybe not for
[1:03:48] bread
[1:03:49] but for the hearing the word of god and
[1:03:52] his truth
[1:03:53] all the churches will socialize and go
[1:03:56] right on into it
[1:03:58] just the same just like they're already
[1:04:01] been swallowed up with
[1:04:03] it when god sends
[1:04:06] forth a message and he tells the people
[1:04:10] and they don't receive it then he
[1:04:12] withdraws his servant
[1:04:13] now listen
[1:04:17] withdraws his servant and sends his
[1:04:21] plagues famine death
[1:04:22] spiritually speaking physically also
[1:04:26] you watch for a depression
[1:04:31] brother you think you've seen something
[1:04:34] you just wait after a while
[1:04:36] you haven't seen nothing you think
[1:04:38] you're dying for a good
[1:04:40] spiritual revival you wait till after a
[1:04:43] bit
[1:04:44] you just wait long and cry to hearing
[1:04:47] the word of god
[1:04:49] now thank with me like i've said over
[1:04:51] and over
[1:04:52] how many times three months ago
[1:04:56] you were saying to me brother dale we've
[1:04:59] missed coming to church
[1:05:04] you was trying to to get your name in
[1:05:07] the pot to get to come to church
[1:05:12] don't you think that's a famine or
[1:05:14] depression a hard time
[1:05:19] i did i wanted to come to church
[1:05:25] i hated to think we'd ever have stripes
[1:05:27] in there to where you couldn't sit close
[1:05:29] enough
[1:05:34] i never thought none of this would take
[1:05:35] place did you
[1:05:38] but it's put us into a depression
[1:05:41] you tell me it's not then go talk to
[1:05:43] your government about it
[1:05:50] what are you going to do
[1:05:57] there'll be a famine in the last days
[1:05:59] the bible said so
[1:06:02] said the prophet and not for bread and
[1:06:04] water alone but for hearing the true
[1:06:06] word of god
[1:06:07] but that voice will be quiet in the
[1:06:09] wilderness
[1:06:10] somewhere head away okay
[1:06:15] you know what that goes to so i don't
[1:06:17] mind saying it
[1:06:18] those things goes to the point of
[1:06:20] thinking that brother branham is going
[1:06:21] to return
[1:06:22] i don't have no problems with it i ain't
[1:06:23] never arguing with nobody about brother
[1:06:25] brown i'm going to return they're not
[1:06:26] going to return
[1:06:31] and you know i'm just saying that
[1:06:32] because i'm blunt i'm playing
[1:06:34] see your mind clicks off and gets over
[1:06:36] on something i have still listening to
[1:06:37] what i'm talking about
[1:06:42] they just make it to be sung
[1:06:47] where did we get to
[1:06:51] all right number four let's go to that
[1:06:54] one because that's the one that
[1:06:55] that i want you to get how can i
[1:06:58] overcome
[1:07:00] but i can't agree with him because he
[1:07:02] talked to somebody about it and
[1:07:04] you'll see the point cause i don't see
[1:07:05] it but it doesn't pertain to salvation
[1:07:08] it's pertaining to the coming of the
[1:07:10] lord he sees the church has to go
[1:07:12] through the tribulation period
[1:07:14] for purification i say the blood of
[1:07:16] jesus christ purify their church see
[1:07:18] its needs no i believe that the church
[1:07:22] goes through the tribulation period
[1:07:26] the church listen organization
[1:07:30] but the bride does not
[1:07:35] see the church will go through the
[1:07:36] tribulation but not the bride
[1:07:39] all right glory for that there's going
[1:07:41] to be a revival
[1:07:44] would you choose a woman you have to
[1:07:45] purify her before you married her
[1:07:47] see christ christ's bride is chosen
[1:07:51] and she is elected and she is god's
[1:07:53] bride the bride of jesus christ
[1:07:55] well that's must be talking about the
[1:07:57] bride because
[1:07:58] that's what i want okay okay go ahead
[1:08:04] philadelphian church age well keep thee
[1:08:07] from our temptation which shall come
[1:08:09] upon
[1:08:09] all the world to try them that dwell
[1:08:11] upon the earth this verse is not a
[1:08:13] declaration that the true church will go
[1:08:15] into
[1:08:16] and through the tribulation as a matter
[1:08:18] of fact it's a statement it won't why
[1:08:20] if it meant that it would have said that
[1:08:23] but it said i will keep thee from the
[1:08:26] hour of temptation he's going to keep us
[1:08:29] he's going to send a revival right amen
[1:08:34] he's going to send a lot of rain
[1:08:42] this temptation is exactly like the
[1:08:44] temptation to need it will be a very
[1:08:46] inviting
[1:08:47] proposition held up in direct opposition
[1:08:51] to god's commanding word
[1:08:53] and yet from the standpoint of human
[1:08:55] reasoning it will be so
[1:08:57] very right so enlightening and the
[1:09:00] life-giving
[1:09:01] as is to fool the world
[1:09:06] now let's go back to where we was while
[1:09:08] ago
[1:09:13] trump's rating went up
[1:09:17] when he says if you're going to have the
[1:09:19] doors open to the brewer and
[1:09:22] we're going to open it to the church his
[1:09:24] raiding went sky
[1:09:25] right but what if he's the antichrist
[1:09:29] oh no no no that's the pope we're going
[1:09:31] to get that a little bit you might be
[1:09:33] looking at pope the wrong way
[1:09:37] you might have to listen
[1:09:41] the pope don't have to pay off our
[1:09:42] national debt
[1:09:45] all he's got to do is tell somebody else
[1:09:46] go pay it right
[1:09:48] exactly right
[1:09:52] and nobody's gone and they think oh he's
[1:09:54] a wonderful guy look what he's done
[1:09:56] and then you some we get up here and say
[1:09:58] something against the guy
[1:10:01] and you know what they'll say to you
[1:10:02] well okay
[1:10:04] if that's the way y'all think that we're
[1:10:06] the antichrist
[1:10:08] then you go pay the bills for your mom
[1:10:09] and daddy they're in a nursing home
[1:10:11] and you go pay all of that
[1:10:17] it's gonna come in like flattery because
[1:10:19] the bible says it will
[1:10:22] come on maybe more serious than we're
[1:10:24] thinking
[1:10:25] see only the elect will not be fooled
[1:10:27] the temptation will come as follows
[1:10:30] the ecumenical move that has started on
[1:10:33] what seemed such a beautiful and blessed
[1:10:35] principle
[1:10:36] what was it fulfilling christ's prayer
[1:10:38] that we
[1:10:39] all might be one that's what that
[1:10:42] started on
[1:10:43] becomes so strong politically
[1:10:46] that she bears pressure upon the
[1:10:49] government
[1:10:49] to cause the all to join with her
[1:10:53] either directly or through appearance
[1:10:56] ad herbs are very pronounced to
[1:10:59] principles enacted
[1:11:00] into law so that no people will be
[1:11:03] recognized
[1:11:04] as actual churches unless under direct
[1:11:07] or indirect domination of this council
[1:11:12] right little groups will lose
[1:11:16] charters
[1:11:19] privileges so forth until they lose
[1:11:23] all property and spiritual rights
[1:11:27] with the people
[1:11:32] for example right now unless the local
[1:11:34] ministerial associate approves it
[1:11:36] in many if not most cities you cannot
[1:11:39] rent a building
[1:11:40] for a religious service i just told you
[1:11:42] for 20 years i've been telling you
[1:11:47] that you can't come to this town it's
[1:11:49] been tried two times i know of that they
[1:11:51] put a church right down here in the
[1:11:53] middle of town it lasted a month
[1:11:59] i'm trying to tell you we're in that
[1:12:01] we're in the place we're in a position
[1:12:03] right well yeah we're looking for it oh
[1:12:05] i don't see no tribulation
[1:12:06] i don't see no that's what that's
[1:12:09] lulling you to sleep
[1:12:12] and then somebody like me said something
[1:12:14] well bless god you go pay my bills then
[1:12:17] cause he agreed to pay my bills
[1:12:22] well i hope we get far enough because if
[1:12:27] we don't
[1:12:28] i'll quote you this one brother ryan
[1:12:29] says keep your homes
[1:12:32] and belong to the catholic church
[1:12:38] oh no that's not the bride that's not
[1:12:40] just well okay
[1:12:42] let's see how far do we get down yeah
[1:12:45] it's almost
[1:12:45] mandatory to be recognized as acceptable
[1:12:48] to the trinitarian ecumenical groups
[1:12:51] as this pressure increases and it will
[1:12:54] it will be harder
[1:12:55] to resist for to resist is to lose
[1:12:58] privilege
[1:12:59] and so many will be tempted to go along
[1:13:02] for they will feel it is better to serve
[1:13:04] god publicly in the framework of this
[1:13:08] what organization than not to serve him
[1:13:12] at all publicly we've got to serve him
[1:13:16] we've got to serve god and the only way
[1:13:18] we can serve god is through that church
[1:13:20] system
[1:13:22] do you see where it's coming the error
[1:13:25] to believe the devil's lie is to serve
[1:13:28] satan
[1:13:29] even though you may want to call him
[1:13:31] jehovah
[1:13:32] but the elect will not be deceived amen
[1:13:37] what about it going to the next where
[1:13:39] are we
[1:13:40] number six sumerian and if you think
[1:13:43] this
[1:13:44] shocking just wait until the prophecy of
[1:13:47] revelations 13
[1:13:48] is fulfilled and read revelation 13 you
[1:13:51] see the image of the beast coming up and
[1:13:53] this comes up over here
[1:13:54] and this one is killed and the uh you
[1:13:56] know the
[1:13:57] the thing uh stroke
[1:14:00] but it comes forth and raises up and
[1:14:02] becomes a great church system
[1:14:04] wow it is strictly true that the united
[1:14:07] states of america is in the chapter the
[1:14:08] very number 13 is a symbol of this
[1:14:10] nation
[1:14:11] it started with 13 colonies his flags
[1:14:14] has 13 stars
[1:14:15] and 13 stripes and there is her destiny
[1:14:19] in the 13th chapter right
[1:14:22] in this image that is mentioned is this
[1:14:25] chap
[1:14:26] in this chapter will be found all the
[1:14:29] wickedness
[1:14:30] of the beast that was before it as the
[1:14:33] beast rose up at night see a council
[1:14:36] so the image will come out of the world
[1:14:38] council of churches
[1:14:39] with all uh ungodly and satanic power to
[1:14:43] vent the anger
[1:14:44] of anger of the devil upon the true
[1:14:48] vine of god now if you don't call that
[1:14:51] but i want to be a druva myself
[1:14:53] it will be a repeat performance of all
[1:14:56] diabolical cunningness and cruelty
[1:15:00] sure we ain't going to be destroyed no
[1:15:05] we ain't going to be destroyed no not
[1:15:06] the bride
[1:15:09] well she's got some hard roads to go
[1:15:13] you say well that's that sounds like
[1:15:14] doomsday to me brother go ahead to the
[1:15:16] next one
[1:15:20] those who fight the humble of god and
[1:15:22] scoff and destroy
[1:15:24] let them do it and do it they will
[1:15:28] and all in the name of god and religion
[1:15:31] but they lie they are not o god they are
[1:15:34] of their father
[1:15:35] the devil they by their deeds
[1:15:38] against any people expose themselves for
[1:15:41] what they are
[1:15:42] let them organize and repudiate the
[1:15:45] little flock
[1:15:47] they will but further reveal to all that
[1:15:50] they are
[1:15:50] of the devil they are the false vine
[1:15:52] divine
[1:15:53] that murders their hatred proves
[1:15:57] who they are now watch in a minute when
[1:15:58] it comes to murder because
[1:16:00] rhetoric said you can be killed for
[1:16:02] praying for the sick you get the word
[1:16:06] murderers and
[1:16:07] their hatred and proves that nicholas
[1:16:09] and doctrine church is who they are
[1:16:11] they shall be cast into prison yes they
[1:16:13] are hauled
[1:16:14] now listen now this is this is not them
[1:16:17] doing it
[1:16:18] they shall be cast into prison yes they
[1:16:20] are hailed
[1:16:22] into court and falsely accused and tried
[1:16:25] and
[1:16:25] imprisoned and that of course it is all
[1:16:28] done
[1:16:28] in the name of religion and decency and
[1:16:30] outraged innocence
[1:16:32] all done for a good cause that makes me
[1:16:35] think of the supreme court's ruling on
[1:16:37] prayer
[1:16:37] and the bible reading and things it's
[1:16:40] another angry outburst
[1:16:42] against god listen
[1:16:46] can't you see my point of what i'm
[1:16:48] trying to get at
[1:16:51] you don't believe in the persecution
[1:16:53] because you don't think god would allow
[1:16:54] you to do it well what if he's doing
[1:16:56] that for your perfection
[1:17:03] oh my god not a god like that well okay
[1:17:06] all right
[1:17:11] but you see folks that's what i said
[1:17:14] i've preached on these for years and
[1:17:15] years but i chose this while i was all
[1:17:17] thinking about it
[1:17:18] i'm thinking surely god
[1:17:21] how dumb and idiots we would be to not
[1:17:25] to look
[1:17:25] down and see for months and months these
[1:17:27] things are working right
[1:17:29] in the things of of the devil and his
[1:17:31] ways of doing things
[1:17:33] but yet also in god's ways of bringing
[1:17:35] it to pisces and allowing these things
[1:17:37] to happen
[1:17:38] and bring it right down to the point to
[1:17:40] get the little bride to the point that
[1:17:41] she would call out for deliverance
[1:17:50] yeah but i've always believed god was a
[1:17:52] good god amen
[1:17:55] he certainly is
[1:17:59] let's see let's see if we can get a
[1:18:00] little bit more where we got number
[1:18:03] number eight christ is the mystery of
[1:18:06] god reveal
[1:18:07] and they're going to bring a persecution
[1:18:09] on pretty soon
[1:18:12] shut up all the churches you see that in
[1:18:14] churches like this
[1:18:17] so evidently they must be talking about
[1:18:19] branham tabernacle on time
[1:18:22] who is not denomination they'll use them
[1:18:24] for storehouse anything
[1:18:26] and if any man goes and offers a prayer
[1:18:29] for anybody
[1:18:30] else that don't belong to the ecumenical
[1:18:33] movement
[1:18:34] will be shot on the spot it's already
[1:18:38] that lutheran minister the head of it
[1:18:40] said so
[1:18:41] and it's right here you can read it
[1:18:44] right here
[1:18:45] in your magazine
[1:18:50] i love this one i'll read this to you
[1:18:51] because i don't want you to miss it
[1:18:52] because you'll see that i'm not doomed
[1:18:54] today we're gonna have to end it before
[1:18:55] we get to it but hold on just a minute
[1:18:57] don't make any difference what they say
[1:18:59] that church will stand
[1:19:00] all right because she's already proved
[1:19:02] it right we're not gonna be down and out
[1:19:04] we're not gonna miss it
[1:19:06] go ahead to the next then number nine
[1:19:11] sardis in church age you know we're
[1:19:13] living in the end time
[1:19:15] it is in the end time that the churches
[1:19:16] are going to come together
[1:19:18] and as they are even now controlling
[1:19:20] world politics
[1:19:22] they will soon control the finances of
[1:19:24] the world
[1:19:27] then if you don't belong to the world
[1:19:30] organization of churches
[1:19:31] you won't be able to buy or sell
[1:19:34] you will lose all
[1:19:38] those who stay true to god and keep
[1:19:40] their garments clean from the
[1:19:42] defilement of this world system of
[1:19:44] churches
[1:19:45] orders will be physically bereft
[1:19:52] now you look at word of rev means you're
[1:19:53] going to lose all
[1:19:57] and like i said
[1:20:00] you know what are you going to do hey
[1:20:02] talking to my two boys what are you
[1:20:03] going to do
[1:20:05] here it comes up mom and dad is too old
[1:20:07] to work
[1:20:10] if you don't take care of them we're
[1:20:12] going to dump them
[1:20:15] well you're going to have to take care
[1:20:16] of us are they gonna dump you
[1:20:19] i mean you're not fuss i ain't making no
[1:20:22] point i'm just making a point i'm trying
[1:20:23] to get you to look at a point
[1:20:26] all it takes is a stroke of the pen and
[1:20:27] you and i got problems
[1:20:34] that's why i'm saying i got a call the
[1:20:36] other day in my life
[1:20:38] sister called she said brother dale said
[1:20:40] i'm trying my best to do something you

[1:20:54] need to do
[1:20:56] you know what i've told you over and
[1:20:58] over and over
[1:21:00] we're not the mormons that put up a
[1:21:01] year's supply of groceries but that's a
[1:21:03] good idea
[1:21:07] but you still ought to at least buy up a
[1:21:09] few things and set them up in your
[1:21:10] cabinets at home
[1:21:11] you may need them in the next few months
[1:21:14] what's it going to hurt
[1:21:16] well that would be me showing my lack of
[1:21:19] faith
[1:21:20] come on you're going to live by faith
[1:21:21] i'm going to live by can of beans if i
[1:21:23] can get them
[1:21:26] that's my faith you say you're
[1:21:29] acting silly no i'm not i'm trying to
[1:21:30] make it look like you're acting silly
[1:21:34] because why does it matter
[1:21:38] if you lived out where we do when the
[1:21:39] power company comes out there and
[1:21:41] and the lights it off for four days and
[1:21:43] everybody up something down the road's
[1:21:44] got power and we don't have any
[1:21:46] you'll wind up putting up a can of beans
[1:21:48] here in yonder
[1:21:52] you'll buy a generator you'll do things
[1:21:54] to try to preserve what you got right
[1:21:56] that's right
[1:21:59] we've been without power for four or
[1:22:01] five days when the people all the way
[1:22:02] around us had power
[1:22:04] well until they get it connected all the
[1:22:05] way back to gainesville we don't get it
[1:22:07] down here
[1:22:08] because we're on the end of the line
[1:22:10] that's just a natural story to tell you
[1:22:19] what is that old statement don't let
[1:22:21] your left hand know what your right hand
[1:22:22] is do it or
[1:22:23] whatever it is
[1:22:29] listen church what are we doing
[1:22:34] they'll lose all those who stay true to
[1:22:37] god and keep their garments clean from
[1:22:39] the defilement of this world system
[1:22:41] of church orders will be
[1:22:45] church orders will be physically bereft
[1:22:48] that will be presented to them a great
[1:22:50] temptation to give in
[1:22:52] preachers will give in with the excuse
[1:22:54] that they will serve god within the
[1:22:56] framework of the antichrist
[1:22:58] beast system they will give in to the
[1:23:01] flatteries and banishments
[1:23:03] of the hierarchy listen i'm not a dummy
[1:23:07] i know something else too you got people
[1:23:10] right now that are out there fussing
[1:23:12] listening to me saying it's about
[1:23:13] persecution coming to a group of people
[1:23:15] abroad
[1:23:16] and they're going to be the ones there
[1:23:18] they're they're going to say
[1:23:19] you're faults you're wrong you're wrong
[1:23:21] on teaching that stuff like that
[1:23:22] when you let it come to time when the
[1:23:24] debts come to and they're going to knock
[1:23:26] on my door
[1:23:27] and want some money to get by
[1:23:31] do you get it
[1:23:36] oh yeah you can fuss and argue all you
[1:23:38] want to now you're going to do this now
[1:23:39] but when it comes to you're hungry
[1:23:41] you're going to be hungry
[1:23:43] i'll do like i told them at work one
[1:23:45] time we were getting laid off the night
[1:23:46] shift
[1:23:47] and there's everybody saying well we're
[1:23:48] going to do this we're going to do that
[1:23:49] so what are you going to do sam i said
[1:23:51] well i'm i'm
[1:23:52] going to i'm going to get up my beans
[1:23:54] and my corn and
[1:23:55] my stuff that i got fixed and i said i'm
[1:23:57] going to make sure that i got me a good
[1:23:59] milk bucket i said what are you going to
[1:24:01] do with the middleweights i'm going to
[1:24:02] build the neighbor's cow
[1:24:05] because i'm going to live all right
[1:24:08] say sorry but listen
[1:24:12] because you don't like for me to be
[1:24:13] blunt like that but the very people
[1:24:16] that are against you now
[1:24:20] for your thoughts you let them get
[1:24:22] hungry
[1:24:24] they'll be at your house
[1:24:28] and they'll condemn you you mean you're
[1:24:30] not going to give me nothing to eat
[1:24:33] you're you ain't a christian
[1:24:37] how long did we talk to the lady sitting
[1:24:39] right out here terrence
[1:24:42] that lady kept saying it i mean you're
[1:24:45] supposed to be a christian
[1:24:46] you're supposed to help me i said hep is
[1:24:49] one thing doing what you want to get me
[1:24:51] done
[1:24:52] that's right no but in the judgment they
[1:24:56] will all be found naked they will not be
[1:24:58] given
[1:24:58] those white robes see the people that
[1:25:00] reject it won't neither will they walk
[1:25:02] with him
[1:25:03] you can't walk in the spotted garments
[1:25:05] of the world holding hands with the
[1:25:07] devil
[1:25:07] hear and then expect to be with god it
[1:25:10] is time
[1:25:11] to wake up and to hear the voice of god
[1:25:14] crying now
[1:25:15] i'm right putting that in there because
[1:25:18] of one thing
[1:25:18] this message is the life's message that
[1:25:21] was to strike the earth
[1:25:22] right we're not looking for another
[1:25:24] message to come another messenger to
[1:25:26] come
[1:25:26] another thing to take place no we've
[1:25:29] already had the message
[1:25:31] the message has been delivered to us by
[1:25:33] the prophet of god we've got that
[1:25:34] message what follows that
[1:25:36] when the people reject that message they
[1:25:40] have no right to cry out for help
[1:25:43] i don't want to hold if i can get that
[1:25:45] one okay
[1:25:47] let's see don't protect your sin they're
[1:25:49] receiving not of the plagues they mean
[1:25:51] god is speaking
[1:25:52] shun the religions of this world like
[1:25:54] you shun the plague
[1:25:55] i don't mean we don't have neighbors
[1:25:57] we've got neighbors over here we do
[1:25:59] anything they want us to do they do
[1:26:00] anything we want to do
[1:26:01] not talking like that sunday religious
[1:26:03] ideas the principles are the thoughts
[1:26:06] the doctrines the denominational that's
[1:26:08] your mark of the beast where's the
[1:26:09] market to be
[1:26:10] in your forehead not stamped up there
[1:26:14] your forehead is where your thinking is
[1:26:16] at
[1:26:18] and see you've got their doctrine in
[1:26:20] there and they're in the hands i mean
[1:26:21] you've got the money in your hand
[1:26:25] we're already to that point they
[1:26:27] received none of our plagues
[1:26:28] god is speaking out showing the religion
[1:26:30] of this world like he's shown to play
[1:26:32] leave off walking with the world and
[1:26:34] make your garments wipe
[1:26:37] repent it with repentance and the blood
[1:26:39] of jesus go ahead
[1:26:40] i'm trying to find one and i'll quit on
[1:26:42] it
[1:26:46] this is from the assuming of the church
[1:26:47] ages the false church groups will come
[1:26:50] together in a world council of churches
[1:26:53] this world council of churches
[1:26:55] is the image erected to the beast
[1:26:57] revelations 13 11-18
[1:26:59] okay this may seem far-fetched
[1:27:02] to some but actually it is very plain
[1:27:05] for all to see
[1:27:07] because right now the churches are
[1:27:08] controlling politics
[1:27:10] and at the opportune time will manifest
[1:27:13] exactly how great
[1:27:15] is that control this ecumenical move
[1:27:20] will end up with rome at the head even
[1:27:22] though the people
[1:27:23] did not envision it that way
[1:27:27] this is so because in revelation 17 3
[1:27:30] through it states that the mystery
[1:27:33] babylon
[1:27:34] is seated on the beast she is
[1:27:36] controlling the lies of our fourth
[1:27:38] empire
[1:27:39] this roman church is going is doing that
[1:27:42] with the world church system
[1:27:43] under her control will be controlling
[1:27:46] and this
[1:27:47] image church system will be obedient to
[1:27:50] the rome because rome controls the goal
[1:27:53] to the world now we'll get to there
[1:27:54] because we're not going to we'll get to
[1:27:56] that this evening the gold of the world
[1:28:00] does all the people have to belong to
[1:28:02] the world church systems
[1:28:03] or be at the mercy of the elements
[1:28:08] for they cannot buy or sell without the
[1:28:10] mark of the beast
[1:28:11] in the hand or head hey now before you
[1:28:15] throw
[1:28:16] too many stones
[1:28:19] just remember the bride don't go through
[1:28:21] the tribulation
[1:28:22] and that is pertaining to the
[1:28:24] tribulation when the mark of the beast
[1:28:26] comes into view
[1:28:29] sure i'm not telling because that's what
[1:28:31] it is
[1:28:33] the image of the beast is erected in in
[1:28:35] the tribulation and different things
[1:28:36] like that
[1:28:37] so sure it applies for that but it
[1:28:38] applies where it says this mark in the
[1:28:40] hand
[1:28:40] is what it means you know the power with
[1:28:43] the great
[1:28:44] power the church systems will persecute
[1:28:47] roll that on up
[1:28:48] before we get to bottom the true bride
[1:28:52] now during that where you'd see he's
[1:28:53] talking about the true bride
[1:28:55] see with this great power the church
[1:28:58] system will persecute the true bride
[1:29:00] this image will try to keep the bride
[1:29:03] from preaching
[1:29:04] and teaching so forth her ministers will
[1:29:07] be forbidden to give
[1:29:08] comfort and the truth to the people who
[1:29:11] need it
[1:29:12] but before the antichrist listen in
[1:29:14] person takes over
[1:29:16] and this is getting on over closer to my
[1:29:17] revival okay
[1:29:19] this complete world system of church of
[1:29:22] churches the true
[1:29:23] church will be taken away from this
[1:29:26] world
[1:29:26] to be with the lord god will catch them
[1:29:29] away his bride
[1:29:31] for the great marriage supper of the
[1:29:33] lamb i'm not a doomsday
[1:29:37] we'll start on these things and pick it
[1:29:39] up because if i go any further i want to
[1:29:41] go into that
[1:29:42] we'll pick it up this evening and think
[1:29:43] about it
[1:29:46] i'm just trying to get me and you to
[1:29:47] think about one thing
[1:29:49] just look around where we're at in the
[1:29:50] past year that we've been
[1:29:52] we went in the past year from what i
[1:29:54] said while ago to a people of this
[1:29:55] message turning against brother branham
[1:29:58] to denouncing in him and and condemning
[1:30:00] the message and condemning all the
[1:30:02] things he taught
[1:30:04] and going out with their own doctrines
[1:30:05] and ideas of all kind of forms
[1:30:12] then all at once
[1:30:15] plague started falling
[1:30:23] but i've got one in here somewhere i'll
[1:30:24] read it where the prophet said
[1:30:26] that's what you do you turn against the
[1:30:28] message
[1:30:30] and you do god pulls her back
[1:30:34] what did he do to the children of israel
[1:30:35] when they were the victorious people
[1:30:37] resting in the egypt of their time
[1:30:42] they were they were there they were they
[1:30:44] were the happy people
[1:30:45] for i don't know what if it was a
[1:30:47] hundred years it was because it was
[1:30:48] there 400 years
[1:30:50] really 430. but if it was a hundred
[1:30:53] years still it's
[1:30:54] my point's right the children of israel
[1:30:56] never went to egypt as
[1:30:58] as enemies i mean you know as as slaves
[1:31:01] and things
[1:31:01] they went there as that pharaoh put them
[1:31:05] out there
[1:31:05] onto the greatest land that there was
[1:31:07] the goshen and put it there
[1:31:09] and set them up as the people
[1:31:14] but gradually they started falling away
[1:31:20] gradually they started taking the things
[1:31:23] of the romans
[1:31:27] and getting involved with them and god
[1:31:33] pulled away pulled away his presence
[1:31:38] let him go under the persecution
[1:31:44] they went under persecution for no
[1:31:47] telling how many
[1:31:48] years that they were there they were
[1:31:51] under the persecution of
[1:31:53] rome egypt but you know what one day
[1:31:55] they walked out of there
[1:31:57] as victorious people the bible says they
[1:32:00] raged
[1:32:02] egypt in other words i looked it up one
[1:32:04] time i mean they really just physically
[1:32:05] destroyed
[1:32:06] it got to work that they really
[1:32:08] evidently god this must have blessed the
[1:32:09] people because if you listen to prophet
[1:32:11] and then
[1:32:12] get your bible and read it you'll see
[1:32:14] they would actually must walk up to the
[1:32:15] neighbor and say
[1:32:16] if you got any gold i need a bunch of
[1:32:18] gold to take with me we're leaving
[1:32:19] tomorrow
[1:32:20] and you ain't going to need it that's
[1:32:21] right
[1:32:23] you got any food and the bible says they
[1:32:26] raised them they took everything they
[1:32:27] had
[1:32:28] they walked out of there victorious
[1:32:32] in a revival
[1:32:36] okay we know for sure a few years later
[1:32:40] they was in the wilderness of sin we
[1:32:42] know it's a continual cycle
[1:32:44] that's my point is through the church
[1:32:46] age is a continual cycle
[1:32:47] god would move on the scene bring a
[1:32:49] message the message would go forth
[1:32:51] and the people would receive it then
[1:32:53] after a while it starts slowing down
[1:32:55] gradually deteriorating from that
[1:32:57] message to the truth of what it was
[1:32:59] and as it does god sends plagues
[1:33:02] god sent viruses and things all the way
[1:33:04] down he sent this virus
[1:33:10] but this is the only one you'll find in
[1:33:11] the bible
[1:33:13] or anywhere that has struck the whole
[1:33:16] world
[1:33:18] if i'm wrong on that you come tell me
[1:33:20] but i've studied the bible in this
[1:33:22] message a long time this is the only
[1:33:24] time it's all
[1:33:24] worldwide these plagues is worldwide
[1:33:28] on this one
[1:33:33] but you see
[1:33:37] we'll get to it this evening when we
[1:33:39] begin to see that the catholic church
[1:33:41] has the gold
[1:33:46] rome has the bonds i mean the catholic
[1:33:49] church has the
[1:33:50] the bonds of jews has the gold
[1:33:54] 168 billion
[1:33:59] is what's listed in the church book
[1:34:02] now that was in 1960
[1:34:07] how much is that now
[1:34:13] when gold is 1500 an ounce or something
[1:34:17] how much gold do they have they didn't
[1:34:19] need no more
[1:34:21] after that was done
[1:34:25] 1960 they had 168 billion they didn't
[1:34:28] need another dollar
[1:34:30] the interest on it would take care of it
[1:34:34] hey i remember i read a little bit you
[1:34:36] remember when they put social security
[1:34:37] enacted
[1:34:38] you know social security was enacted
[1:34:41] back into what 40s or what it was the
[1:34:43] time
[1:34:43] you all get the dates on that you know
[1:34:45] there's enough money put in that
[1:34:48] bank for that until there was never to
[1:34:50] be anybody have to pay
[1:34:52] taxes no more you didn't was not set up
[1:34:55] for you to pay social security
[1:34:59] it was enough money set aside to take
[1:35:01] care of everything
[1:35:03] but it wouldn't set aside for you for it
[1:35:05] to come to be taking care of
[1:35:07] 15 babies and and all this and the other
[1:35:10] you know and all of these things that
[1:35:11] the people wound up with in life
[1:35:16] my point we're here
[1:35:22] you may not be in church next week
[1:35:26] what are we going to do how about what
[1:35:28] the prophet see
[1:35:34] me and brother used to ride around hunt
[1:35:36] old houses and things
[1:35:39] said well we get by a few days in that
[1:35:41] one it sure needs some fixing up but
[1:35:44] we'd have to turn on a lot somewhere and
[1:35:46] put a little water in to do something
[1:35:50] we're talking about these things
[1:35:53] brother brown says meet an old store
[1:35:55] buildings

[1:36:02] they're gonna put us up they're gonna

[1:36:30] thing but i want to put something to see
[1:36:32] them because i want you to get into
[1:36:33] i want you to think about it between

[1:41:24] that in school you know we used to have
[1:41:25] to make a book report
[1:41:27] well i always loved to read but i hated
[1:41:29] it right
[1:41:30] to get anything like that so i'd get my
[1:41:33] sister to write out the book report and
[1:41:35] i'd sign it and hand it in
[1:41:36] you know because she loved to read and
[1:41:38] write but my point is one thing
[1:41:44] i could read a book and i didn't read it

[1:41:49] through it
[1:41:50] i looked at the front of it in that

[1:42:07] and john and mary got married and lived
[1:42:09] happily ever after
[1:42:10] [Music]
[1:42:13] i didn't write the story if the teacher
[1:42:17] was smart enough and had read that book
[1:42:20] i wrote my own story about john and mary
[1:42:26] and i turned it in and they'd stamp that
[1:42:27] boy that's good
[1:42:29] my sister come in one day and she did
