[0:00] oh
[0:24] um
[0:26] so this morning
[0:27] i want to kind of take a little thought
[0:30] about that scripture that we just read
[0:33] um first thessalonians 4 16
[0:36] for the lord himself shall descend from
[0:38] heaven with a shallow the voice of the
[0:39] archangel with the trump of god and the
[0:41] dead in christ arise first
[0:43] but instead of that scripture
[0:46] not now as we as we go along think about
[0:48] how you know paul
[0:50] as we read up paul keeps making
[0:52] references to the coming of the lord
[0:54] he's talking about how
[0:56] he wants the believers to live sanctify
[0:58] lives and live lives holy to the lord
[1:02] and
[1:02] and and
[1:04] teaching them how to work and how to
[1:05] live
[1:06] and um
[1:08] how to how to be christians because uh
[1:11] the whole point of the ministry i
[1:13] believe is is is to get people into a
[1:16] place where they can have their own
[1:18] personal relationship you know the whole
[1:20] saying about um
[1:22] if you teach a man to fish he can
[1:24] feed himself he can uh you know he can
[1:26] he'll he begins to learn how to teach
[1:28] teach somebody how to study the bible
[1:30] and how to pray and and
[1:33] you know one uh
[1:34] john pulled some up and then uh uh
[1:37] iranians and polly cochran polycarp and
[1:39] then pulled others up and just all down
[1:41] through history it's just one chain of
[1:44] of god working in people to pull keep
[1:46] pulling each other up
[1:48] teaching teaching how to live and how to
[1:50] do a live a holy life a god working in
[1:52] the believers so let's turn
[1:55] to john
[1:57] chapter 11 and read maybe a strange
[2:00] strange scripture
[2:19] and before we read this is
[2:25] lord jesus we thank you god for your
[2:26] grace to us another day to serve you and
[2:29] thank you god for the beautiful weather
[2:31] lord we come today on this day that's
[2:33] not just the
[2:34] roman the s-u-n day but the s-o-n day
[2:38] the day that you rose lord jesus and i
[2:40] pray god that you'll rise in our hearts
[2:42] to understand your word
[2:44] and god granted that you'll be with the
[2:45] services today lord be with brother
[2:47] wayne's sister junior as they travel and
[2:49] minister lord god granted that you'll
[2:51] give them travel and mercies on the way
[2:53] back and all the ones that can't be with
[2:54] us today lord
[2:55] grant that we ask in the name of the
[2:57] lord jesus christ
[3:00] so john chapter 11 let's
[3:03] let's kind of uh just take a second and
[3:05] read through the whole thing just so we
[3:07] get a little or almost we'll see where
[3:09] we stop
[3:11] how far we get just to kind of get the
[3:13] picture of what's going on now a certain
[3:15] man was sick named lazarus of bethany
[3:18] the town of mary and her sister martin
[3:21] it was that mary which anointed the lord
[3:23] of the ointment and wiped his feet with
[3:25] her hair his brother landed us a city
[3:27] therefore his sister sent unto him
[3:29] saying lord behold he whom thou lovest
[3:32] is sick
[3:33] when jesus heard that he said this
[3:35] sickness is not under death but for the
[3:36] glory of god that the son of god might
[3:38] be glorified thereby
[3:40] now jesus loved martha and her sister in
[3:43] lazarus
[3:44] when he had heard therefore that he was
[3:46] sick he above two days still in the same
[3:48] place where he was
[3:50] then after that saith he to his
[3:51] disciples let us go into judea again
[3:55] his disciples said to him master the
[3:57] jews of lake sought to stone thee and go
[3:59] us thou there again jesus answered are
[4:02] they not 12 hours in the day if any man
[4:04] walk in the day he stumbled up because
[4:06] he seeth the light of this world but if
[4:08] a man walk in the night he stumbled
[4:10] because there was no light in it
[4:12] these things said he and after that he
[4:14] saith unto them our friend lazarus
[4:16] sleepeth but i go that i may awake him
[4:18] out of sleep
[4:19] then said his disciples lord if he sleep
[4:22] he shall do well howbeit jesus spoke of
[4:24] his death but they thought that he had
[4:26] spoken of taking of rest and sleep
[4:29] then said jesus unto them plainly
[4:30] lazarus is dead and i am glad for your
[4:33] sakes that i was not there to the intent
[4:34] you may believe nevertheless not let us
[4:36] go unto them
[4:38] then it said thomas which is saudimas
[4:40] unto his fellow disciples let us also go
[4:42] that we may die with him then when jesus
[4:45] came he found that he had lain in the
[4:46] grave four days already
[4:48] now bethany was nine to jerusalem about
[4:50] 15 furlongs off and many of the jews
[4:53] came to martha and married and come for
[4:54] them concerning their brother their
[4:56] brother then martha as soon as she heard
[4:58] that jesus was coming went and met him
[5:00] but martha mary sat still in the house
[5:04] then said martha unto jesus lord if thou
[5:06] has been here my brother had not died
[5:08] but i know that even now whatsoever i
[5:10] will ask from god god will give it thee
[5:13] jesus saith unto her thy brother shall
[5:14] rise again
[5:16] martha saith unto him i know that he
[5:17] shall rise again in the resurrection of
[5:19] the last day jesus said unto her i am
[5:22] the resurrection and the life he that
[5:24] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[5:26] shall he live and whosoever liveth
[5:29] and believeth in me shall never die
[5:32] believeth thou this she saith unto him
[5:34] yea lord i believe that thou art the
[5:36] christ the son of god which should come
[5:39] into the world
[5:40] now let's just stop there her confession
[5:42] and go back and kind of set the stage
[5:44] for this story because
[5:46] now
[5:49] paul and that thessalonians is teaching
[5:52] us the the church he's talking about
[5:55] taking a bite
[5:57] and that's
[5:58] the whole
[6:00] what you know i believe the bride
[6:03] every church that kind of has a
[6:04] specialty luther had his specialty was
[6:07] was uh
[6:08] the the place that he had come to
[6:11] in in the body the light that had been
[6:12] revealed was justification and as you
[6:15] move on up
[6:17] wesley saw sanctification but now we
[6:19] have a specialty and you know you can
[6:21] preach about um
[6:23] uh
[6:24] all the different topics about a little
[6:26] bit loving one another and being good
[6:28] and things all those are needful but the
[6:30] bride in this day has a specialty
[6:32] a special focus of of try of taking a
[6:36] body change and that's what our our
[6:37] special focus is
[6:39] and
[6:40] so when we when we read the
[6:42] scripture
[6:44] where i believe we're reading it trying
[6:46] to get an understanding of how we can
[6:49] take a body change and that's what
[6:50] rapturing faith is raptured faith is a
[6:53] revelation that you can take a body
[6:55] change and that's why we study that's
[6:57] why we go to church that's why we listen
[6:59] to the tapes that's why
[7:01] our our focus is you know brother graham
[7:03] said that the whole the evidence of
[7:05] being born again was that you'd be in
[7:07] the word all the way all the way because
[7:10] you're desperate trying to find out how
[7:13] to get so full of god until god can
[7:16] reveal to you and make it known to you
[7:17] that yes you can take a body change
[7:21] and you will take a body change
[7:24] and you know i believe that uh the bride
[7:27] can come to a revelation
[7:29] will come to a revelation before the
[7:31] body change happens that she is going in
[7:34] it there won't be any any guesswork like
[7:36] all of a sudden you well i i hope you
[7:38] know years ago we kind of hoped
[7:40] maybe
[7:41] maybe it was a little bit i hope so that
[7:44] i hope i'm going to take it
[7:46] but i believe we're coming to a place
[7:47] where we are going to know
[7:50] that we're going to take it that's right
[7:51] that god is doing something personal and
[7:54] personal in our lives that he's
[7:56] revealing something
[7:57] you know uh
[7:59] years ago i remember this story about uh
[8:01] uh well actually my wife was telling me
[8:02] she was at a youth camp
[8:05] where they got all the uh the minister
[8:07] whatever got all the ministers up on
[8:08] stage and said now i want all the
[8:10] ministers to raise up your hand if you
[8:12] uh every time you sometimes you're not
[8:14] sure that you know the devil will tell
[8:16] you you're not sure that you have the
[8:18] holy ghost and maybe you have a little
[8:19] question
[8:20] now
[8:21] i believe that when you get the holy
[8:23] ghost that god can reveal it to you that
[8:25] you
[8:26] know that you have the holy ghost
[8:28] there's not a uh well i you know it's
[8:31] not based on feelings because you have
[8:33] bad days and you have good days and you
[8:35] have you know ups and downs and uh
[8:38] you know gets a little sniffle on things
[8:41] but when god reveals to you that you
[8:43] have the holy ghost
[8:45] it's a revelation of what he's done for
[8:47] you
[8:48] that's why you can't tell somebody i
[8:50] can't tell
[8:51] any of you that you have the holy ghost
[8:52] because it's got to be a personal
[8:54] revelation even when god reveals it to
[8:56] you and it's anchored so far down in unt
[8:58] you know that you know and i believe
[9:00] that's how that's how healing is too
[9:03] if you believe that and you know that
[9:06] god has healed you then as you know
[9:08] brother brown talked about the the
[9:10] little wheel of faith and the big will
[9:12] of god's power and when they get
[9:14] spinning like like the two cogs
[9:16] your little will of faith i believe
[9:18] god's word i believe what he says gets
[9:20] spinning with god's big will of the
[9:23] power of god
[9:24] then it gets moving in conjunction and
[9:27] and something's bound to happen
[9:29] something that's going to happen because
[9:30] you you're resting on god's word god has
[9:32] revealed something to you and nothing in
[9:34] the world can can happen it can stop it
[9:37] if you believe god is able to hear you
[9:40] and has healed you and if he reveals
[9:42] that to you that it's got to happen in
[9:44] the same way with the rapture if he
[9:46] reveals it to you
[9:48] then it's got to happen i believe that
[9:51] now a certain man
[9:52] was sick named lazarus of bethany the
[9:56] town of mary and her sister martha
[9:59] now now i i
[10:01] it's interesting if you if you look at
[10:03] what scholars say
[10:05] a so-called scholar now we believe in a
[10:08] scholar that did not go to any any kind
[10:10] of theological seminary or anything but
[10:13] this man got his education
[10:16] just like you know john the baptist went
[10:18] out into the wilderness
[10:19] because when his parents died his little
[10:21] offering ran out of the wilderness began
[10:22] to eat locusts and wild honey and he got
[10:24] education not from some seminary but by
[10:27] god himself coming and revealing himself
[10:29] to him and this man you know
[10:32] got an education that just confounded
[10:34] the world because he didn't get it from
[10:37] from
[10:38] some teaching he got it from an
[10:40] experience with god and he
[10:43] so the theologists of the day say well
[10:45] jesus was on his way
[10:47] to jerusalem but now brother randall
[10:49] said he was in bethany and then he left
[10:53] and when he left
[10:54] lazarus got sick
[10:56] but jesus was there
[10:57] he was there not now kind of i
[11:00] you know you can you can type a lot of
[11:02] things that i don't want to over type
[11:04] and and uh
[11:06] but i i believe you can kind of look at
[11:09] this because i
[11:10] you know look at the first four books of
[11:12] the bible matthew mark luke and john
[11:15] lyon ox man eagle and the eagle
[11:19] that now john
[11:20] in the book of revelation he saw not
[11:22] just the eagles sitting on the perch but
[11:25] he saw he said the fourth beast looked
[11:27] like a flying eagle it wasn't an eagle
[11:30] sitting up somewhere but it was flying
[11:32] it was up high now the first the first
[11:35] three
[11:36] are rooted on the ground or earthly and
[11:39] then the fourth is taking us up into the
[11:41] heavenlies and that's what john's doing
[11:43] here he's painting a picture of
[11:45] something that that to show us something
[11:47] in the something higher to catch us up
[11:50] because god's always pulling us up he's
[11:52] pulling us up jacob's ladder he's
[11:54] pulling us up into a real where we can
[11:57] catch the revelation and fulfill the
[11:59] word for our day
[12:01] now a certain man will sit named lazarus
[12:03] of bethany the town of mary and her
[12:06] sister martha now bethany has a strange
[12:08] meaning
[12:10] it means
[12:11] beth means house
[12:13] and annie means sorrow
[12:16] and uh
[12:18] now now look uh
[12:20] let me uh
[12:22] let me read genesis 3 16. y'all don't
[12:25] have to turn there i'll just read it for
[12:26] you
[12:32] because we're all living in a house of
[12:34] sorrow in genesis 3 16
[12:37] he told the woman unto the woman he said
[12:39] i will greatly multiply thy sorrow
[12:41] and thy conception
[12:43] in sorrow thou shalt bring forth
[12:45] children
[12:46] and thy desire shall be to thy husband
[12:48] he shall deliver thee
[12:50] and under adam he said because now he's
[12:52] hearkened under the voice of thy wife
[12:54] and as eaten over the tree of which i
[12:56] commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat
[12:58] it cursed is the ground but i say
[13:00] in sorrow shall that eat of it all the
[13:02] days of our life
[13:04] because of what they had done
[13:07] they were living in sorrow
[13:10] now the whole of humanity was dwelling
[13:12] in this house of bethany
[13:14] uh no just to paint a picture now
[13:17] when you type something you there's some
[13:19] things in the type that don't don't
[13:21] maybe
[13:22] uh
[13:23] you know joseph was not jesus christ
[13:27] but you know you can look at his life
[13:28] and kind of figure out
[13:30] how the the
[13:32] learn some things you know the the woman
[13:34] with leaven was was not the kingdom of
[13:37] heaven look at that story and learn
[13:39] about the kingdom of heaven
[13:41] by looking at that type now you can look
[13:44] at this type of how lazarus now down in
[13:48] the in the investment
[13:50] uh
[13:52] there was this family who was who was
[13:54] going through this little situation this
[13:56] little story
[13:58] and and uh lazarus when jesus was there
[14:01] in in bethany and then he left now let
[14:03] me read the reading of this quote where
[14:05] uh brother branham said that jesus was
[14:07] there
[14:10] uh and then jesus came and called 1964.
[14:14] now in this case jesus had been told to
[14:16] the father to leave the home
[14:18] and to go away if you notice how it
[14:20] worked they after lazarus took sick and
[14:23] no doubt many of them said oh now let's
[14:25] see where that holy preacher is now
[14:26] that's going to pray for the sick he
[14:28] isn't on the scene and then i'm just get
[14:30] down to perry 49
[14:32] now when jesus left the home why that
[14:35] death and trouble
[14:37] set in
[14:39] now jesus left the home he was there and
[14:41] then he then he was there prison
[14:44] and then he left
[14:45] now
[14:46] and that's not typing anything bad or
[14:48] anything but now
[14:49] jesus was walking that he was present in
[14:51] the in the beginning in the first church
[14:53] age he was present
[14:55] walking and veiled in flesh and then as
[14:59] soon as he left they began to get a
[15:01] little get a little off the beaten path
[15:03] he said the message in revelation to the
[15:05] to the first church age was you've left
[15:07] your first love you forgot your first
[15:09] love and it they began to get a little
[15:11] sick
[15:12] they got they got uh
[15:14] they had lost the the love for christ
[15:19] and it got began to get a little away
[15:20] and they got sicker
[15:22] and sicker and sicker until
[15:25] the fourth church age
[15:27] death
[15:28] was present because uh
[15:30] you know they began the seed had to go
[15:32] into the ground
[15:34] so that it could come forth again
[15:36] now to see the the same kind of where
[15:38] i'm going
[15:40] at verse 2 it was that mary which
[15:42] anointed the lord with ointment and
[15:44] wiped his feet with her hair
[15:48] whose brother lazarus was sick
[15:51] therefore his sister sent on them saying
[15:53] lord behold he whom thou lovest
[15:56] is sick
[15:57] now i just want to kind of so jesus left
[16:01] and and uh i was reading various
[16:03] commentaries on how long he was away
[16:06] and
[16:07] i found it was really interesting that
[16:08] one said he he left for about a day
[16:11] and then he got word that jesus was that
[16:14] lazarus was sick
[16:16] so when jesus heard that he said this
[16:17] sickness is not of death
[16:19] but for the glory of god that the son of
[16:21] god might be glorified thereby
[16:25] it's not under death
[16:27] you know i think bad things happen and
[16:29] uh it's you're you can never be
[16:32] separated from the love of god if you're
[16:34] if you're if you're a real born-again
[16:37] christian
[16:39] what can separate you from the love of
[16:40] god death or as paul said it went
[16:43] through that long list of all the
[16:44] different things in this separate you
[16:46] can then separate you
[16:47] none of those things can separate you
[16:49] from the love of god if you're really
[16:51] born again when jesus heard that he said
[16:53] this sickness is not under death but for
[16:55] the glory of god that the son of god
[16:56] might be glorified thereby
[16:59] now jesus loved martha and her sister
[17:01] and lazarus when he had heard therefore
[17:03] that he was sick he abode two days still
[17:05] in the same place
[17:07] where he was so he he heard that he was
[17:09] sick
[17:10] and he said well i'm gonna stay another
[17:13] two days
[17:15] so he waited two more days
[17:17] then after that saith he to his
[17:19] disciples let us go into judea again
[17:22] his disciples saying to him master the
[17:24] jews of late sought to stone thee
[17:26] and go us thou thither again
[17:29] jesus answered other not 12 hours in the
[17:32] day if any man walk in the day he
[17:34] stumbleth not because he seeth a lot of
[17:36] this world but if a man walk in the
[17:38] night he stumbleth because there is no
[17:40] light in him these things said he and
[17:42] after that he saith unto them our friend
[17:45] lazarus sleepeth
[17:47] but i go that i may awake him out of
[17:49] sleep
[17:51] now
[17:52] so for three days
[17:55] lazarus was getting sicker and sicker
[17:58] and then he died and there he was in the
[18:00] ground
[18:01] now i'm i'm comparing this if you
[18:04] disagree maybe just toss the seed out
[18:06] but i'm kind of comparing praying this
[18:07] with the down through the seven church
[18:09] ages the church got sicker and sicker
[18:12] because they got they got further and
[18:14] further off the word until uh you know
[18:17] entire tire brother branham compared
[18:19] ahab and jezebel and ah churches stay
[18:21] married and they set up the pope and and
[18:24] they they joined together they sent that
[18:27] pope over them and said instead of god
[18:29] and the church that seed went into the
[18:31] ground and and it had to come forth
[18:34] again one day
[18:36] jesus answered let's see
[18:40] then said his disciples lord if he sleep
[18:43] he shall do well how be it jesus spake
[18:45] of his death but they thought that he
[18:47] had spoken of taking
[18:49] of rest and sleep then said jesus unto
[18:52] them plainly lazarus is dead and i am
[18:54] glad for your sakes that i was not there
[18:57] to the intent you may believe
[18:59] nevertheless let us go unto him
[19:01] then said thomas which is called did him
[19:03] us unto his fellow disciples
[19:05] let us also go that we may die with him
[19:08] then when jesus came he found that he
[19:11] had laying in the grave four days
[19:14] already
[19:15] so he was sick for three days
[19:17] and then he laying in the ground for
[19:19] four days which makes seven days
[19:23] on the seventh day
[19:25] what was happening the the threat that
[19:27] little family there
[19:28] was waiting for jesus to come for his
[19:32] return so that he could raise lazarus
[19:34] from the dead and bring lazarus back to
[19:37] life
[19:40] and that's why
[19:41] you know brother branham before he he
[19:43] preached the the prayer lines he would
[19:45] preach
[19:46] he
[19:47] several times he preached that little
[19:48] message then jesus came
[19:51] and called because he was showing that
[19:53] that same jesus that was shown talked
[19:56] about in in in all of these new
[19:58] testament stories
[20:00] was there
[20:01] was there veiled in flesh again to heal
[20:04] to to make known the secrets of the
[20:07] heart to heal the body that he was
[20:09] present
[20:10] that he had come that he was coming
[20:14] then when jesus came
[20:16] he found that he had lain in the grave
[20:18] four days already now bethany was nigh
[20:20] unto jerusalem about 15 furlongs off
[20:23] and many of the jews came to martha and
[20:26] mary to comfort them concerning their
[20:28] brother
[20:29] then martha as soon as she heard that
[20:30] jesus was coming went and met him but
[20:33] mary says still in the house
[20:37] then martha said unto jesus lord if thou
[20:39] has been here my brother had not died
[20:42] but i know that even now whatsoever thou
[20:45] will ask god god will give it thee jesus
[20:48] saying under earth thy brother shall
[20:50] rise again
[20:52] mars of martha's sailor to him i know
[20:54] that he shall rise again in the
[20:55] resurrection at the last day
[20:57] jesus said unto her i am the
[20:59] resurrection of the life he that
[21:01] believeth in me though he were dead
[21:04] yet shall he live and whosoever liveth
[21:06] and believeth in me shall never die
[21:09] believe us thou this
[21:11] she saith unto mea lord i believe that
[21:13] thou art the christ the son of god we
[21:15] should come into the world and when she
[21:17] had so said she went away and called
[21:19] mary her sister secretly
[21:21] saying the master is cometh is come
[21:24] and calleth for thee
[21:26] now we are
[21:28] we are first now remember at first
[21:29] thessalonians chapter four
[21:32] there's got to come
[21:33] a shout
[21:34] a voice and a trunk
[21:37] to take us to the wedding supper
[21:39] first there's got to come a call and i
[21:42] believe this type that shout that call
[21:45] now the shout is the the bread of life
[21:47] that came down out of heaven that god
[21:50] has given us in this last day
[21:52] to hear the message and read it and and
[21:55] become one with the word uniting us with
[21:57] him and now
[22:01] look at
[22:02] it it's so simple that you have to
[22:05] partake of the word
[22:06] but never remember that parable of the
[22:08] five foolish verses of the five wise
[22:10] virgins right at the end when the
[22:12] bridegroom came
[22:14] then the five foolish virgins realized
[22:17] that they didn't hadn't been
[22:19] this is this is i believe the revelation
[22:21] that they realized that they hadn't been
[22:23] partaking of it maybe they'd just been
[22:25] sitting in church
[22:27] maybe they had just been around the the
[22:30] message around the uh
[22:32] the revival but hadn't actually partaken
[22:34] of it and they realized they needed to
[22:37] go out and buy and buy for their self
[22:39] they re they realized they needed to put
[22:42] a little effort into reading the bible
[22:43] get their own personal revelation they
[22:46] realized that they needed to go listen
[22:47] to the tapes and the books because
[22:50] listen now the five foolish virgins have
[22:52] to have a revelation too
[22:54] when they when the rapture goes when the
[22:57] rapture takes place the five foolish
[23:00] versions that have to know that the
[23:01] rapture has taken place and they have to
[23:03] know what is going on they have to know
[23:07] what what the lay of the land is and
[23:09] what's going on with the pope and and
[23:12] and that they need to stay uh
[23:15] stay
[23:16] pure and and live that you know
[23:19] to go through the tribulation and endure
[23:22] the persecution that the foolish virgin
[23:24] will have to endure they've got to know
[23:27] something is going on you you can't go
[23:29] through that without having some kind of
[23:31] a revelation and think about how what a
[23:34] pitiful situation is that they realize
[23:36] too late
[23:38] that they need to read for themselves
[23:40] that they need to study they need to
[23:43] spend time
[23:44] with in prayer for their self that they
[23:46] need to
[23:47] have their own personal revelation but
[23:50] they were foolish
[23:51] they didn't spend their time wisely they
[23:53] didn't redeem the time
[23:55] now uh
[23:57] that's uh
[24:00] because they didn't
[24:02] maybe maybe they heard the shout but
[24:04] they didn't hear the shout they didn't
[24:06] realize the importance of a god-sent
[24:08] prophet
[24:12] and we just have just a few more minutes
[24:15] let me see where i am
[24:23] what's that 23.
[24:26] thank you
[24:27] and when she associated she went away
[24:29] and called mary her sister secretly
[24:31] saying the master is come
[24:34] and calleth for thee now we've heard the
[24:36] call
[24:38] because
[24:39] the master is coming
[24:41] and calleth for thee he is come
[24:44] as soon as she heard that she arose
[24:46] quickly and came unto him now what's
[24:48] what's the master coming for
[24:51] the master would not come
[24:54] unless it was for you
[24:56] and that's what the revelation is that
[24:58] he's coming for you he's coming
[25:01] first you got to believe that that he's
[25:04] he's coming to get you
[25:06] still like with healing you believe that
[25:08] that god wants to hear you you believe
[25:10] that god wants to save you and that's
[25:12] what that's what compared with what's a
[25:14] lot a lot of
[25:15] ministers are preaching that there's no
[25:16] grace for ones that are not born under
[25:19] certain genealogy there's no no mercy
[25:21] but uh you know
[25:23] god's blood made a way for us to be
[25:26] saved
[25:27] and i that's why i believe you know
[25:29] brother brown said every every christian
[25:31] every real christian is an optimist
[25:33] because you believe that there's a way
[25:35] there's all things impossible in the
[25:37] belief a real christian is an optimist
[25:41] so god called as soon as she heard that
[25:43] she rose quickly
[25:45] he called by a shout he sent him he sent
[25:47] a messenger to to to
[25:50] to call us to him he came unto him and
[25:52] now jesus was not yet coming into town
[25:54] but was in that place where martha made
[25:56] it
[25:57] and i'm gonna jump down just have a few
[25:59] more
[26:08] let's jump down
[26:10] to around verse 41.
[26:12] now brother branham when he would always
[26:14] preach this story he talked about how
[26:16] jesus comes
[26:17] in the darkest hour in the darkest time
[26:20] when it looks like there's no more
[26:22] believers
[26:23] it looks like you know like elijah
[26:25] looked a despaired he thought elijah was
[26:28] living in the dark ages of the old
[26:30] testament
[26:31] when it looked like there was nobody
[26:33] else that believed and god showed him
[26:34] that yeah i got i got a few set aside
[26:36] that are believing and now in this age
[26:39] it looks like everybody's falling away
[26:41] and there's nobody believing
[26:43] but god has got a few people set aside
[26:45] and it's going to be such a small number
[26:47] that he brother brown said he'd be
[26:48] surprised if it was eight just like noah
[26:50] because how how uh
[26:53] how few there are
[26:55] that will really
[26:56] uh desired enough to lay aside every
[26:59] weight that so easily possess us
[27:02] that desire so much to get in to the
[27:05] straight narrow way
[27:06] to study and find find out how to take
[27:09] this body change
[27:11] and
[27:12] so such a small little group
[27:15] then it took away let's see
[27:18] they took away the stone from the place
[27:20] where the dead was laid and jesus lifted
[27:22] up his eyes and said
[27:23] father i thank thee the thou has heard
[27:25] me now i forgot what my thought was and
[27:28] in the darkest time now now
[27:30] down through this
[27:33] when jesus
[27:34] he came up on the scene in a dark time
[27:37] for them
[27:38] it looked like all hook was gone
[27:40] everybody was talking about him just the
[27:42] way everybody's talking about the
[27:43] message believers
[27:46] because they don't understand what god
[27:48] is doing
[27:49] and and then in that dark hour that
[27:51] jesus came along
[27:53] to prove that he was still the same
[27:56] yesterday today and forever to prove
[27:58] that he was still a word now that's what
[28:00] everybody always got mad at jesus now
[28:01] because he said i my father are one and
[28:04] he healed people on sunday they got uh
[28:07] on the sabbath they got they got mad at
[28:09] him because of his confession
[28:12] now
[28:13] now look that's that's what people makes
[28:15] people mad you know we all we like to
[28:17] quote about how paul said i'm the
[28:19] chiefest of sinners
[28:21] but you know paul also said i'm not far
[28:23] behind the chiefest of the apostles
[28:26] and we just read in first thessalonians
[28:27] where paul was talking about look how i
[28:29] have approached you i approached you in
[28:31] meekness and immediately i approached
[28:32] you like i i've approached you in such
[28:34] such a way i know who i am i know what
[28:37] i'm here to do because paul had a
[28:39] confession he knew what god had sent him
[28:41] for now when the bride begins to get a
[28:44] confession of that she knows
[28:46] that her father she and the father are
[28:48] one and and these other things then that
[28:52] uh that the show pulls away because
[28:54] it just makes it
[28:56] you know it's like you know
[28:59] these this is too much this is too rich
[29:01] for me
[29:04] and um
[29:06] so now here comes jesus he jesus is on
[29:09] the scene and he's come
[29:11] and he speaks with a loud voice when he
[29:13] had this spoken he cried with a loud
[29:15] voice lazarus
[29:16] come forth
[29:18] and he that was dead came forth bound
[29:20] hand and foot with great grave clothes
[29:22] and his face was bound about with the
[29:25] napkins you just say unto them
[29:27] loose him and let him go and i have some
[29:29] quotes about it because now now look
[29:31] about how that that little parable of
[29:33] the level how you eat
[29:35] and you read and you have a personal
[29:37] relationship and you're taking in the
[29:39] word until you become the fullness the
[29:42] the whole bride together not just one
[29:44] person becomes the fullness of the
[29:45] goddess bodily
[29:47] god living in you making manifest until
[29:49] he takes over your being until he takes
[29:51] you over until uh you know brother
[29:53] graham said you'll be a couple birds of
[29:55] a change
[29:56] right up to the change but then the
[29:57] change comes and you're not a cockapoo
[29:59] anymore
[30:00] because the change comes that's why your
[30:03] comfortable right to change because
[30:05] you're gonna be a couple more times
[30:09] you're 100 percent completely part of
[30:12] god
[30:14] and and that's what the shout is sent
[30:16] for to to make to bring you to that
[30:19] state
[30:19] where you just consumed by the word of
[30:21] god and you become so perfectly in line
[30:23] that you believe that it's possible for
[30:25] god to change you that you believe it's
[30:27] possible for him to do it and then
[30:30] what does the bride
[30:32] what does the bride become
[30:34] what
[30:42] now
[30:43] and the way i've seen church age in the
[30:45] church book
[30:46] the word has been put aside so god says
[30:48] i am going against you all i will spew
[30:50] you out of my mouth
[30:52] split you out of my mouth why do i just
[30:54] pick people out of their mouth because
[30:55] they're not hot or cold because they're
[30:57] not the voice of god for that age
[31:07] and those elect with him in that day
[31:09] will be the ones who truly manifest the
[31:11] lord and be his body and be his voice
[31:15] and perform his works and then lay the
[31:17] church age further down but god said
[31:19] luther with the word the lutheran spoke
[31:21] for god at that time
[31:23] and uh and then they denominated he said
[31:25] they could no longer speak for god then
[31:27] god said wasteland he was the voice with
[31:29] the word in his day and then in this
[31:32] last day we will be under the under our
[31:34] messenger will be the final voice to the
[31:36] final age and i'll stop right there
