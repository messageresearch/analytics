[8:36] service and I said how's it going he
[8:38] said well brother Aaron's preaching my
[8:39] sermon I don't have anything to preach I
[8:42] said I feel the same way you do the same
[8:45] thing to me so don't be angry with
[8:49] him so um good to be in the house of the
[8:51] Lord good to be back uh we had a
[8:53] wonderful time in Ohio they said to tell
[8:54] you hello and uh greetings in the name
[8:57] of the lord they're uh
[9:00] um they're doing well they've got some
[9:02] uh things they are working on but what
[9:07] did I read to y'all brother R said a
[9:08] church without uh a little bit of uh
[9:11] heartache is not a church so we sure U
[9:15] appreciate them and we love them with
[9:17] the love of the Lord and we all are
[9:18] there to uh to help them so uh I think
[9:21] we're running out of screen here um so I
[9:25] don't know what's going on Josh come
[9:27] here help me this for a minute
[9:32] all this new
[9:35] stuff what do we doing
[9:40] here I don't want ink I don't want to be
[9:43] inking so what I need to
[9:46] do I don't want that either put that
[9:50] I've been tapping
[9:56] it say by now
[9:59] oh I'm on you left me
[10:03] on I want to read something to you real
[10:06] quick while you're
[10:08] standing and it's really interesting
[10:11] because uh if you've been watching any
[10:12] of the news that U Joe Biden is getting
[10:15] ready to cut off a little bit of help to
[10:19] Israel this is not the first time he
[10:21] done that in
[10:24] 1982 monum Bean which was the Prime
[10:27] Minister of Israel came to visit
[10:30] Washington and young Joe Biden Senator
[10:33] Joe Biden at the
[10:35] time they had invaded Libya are in
[10:38] Lebanon and they were you know they were
[10:41] defending their
[10:43] country and it kind of got heated
[10:46] because then Biden told him said well
[10:48] we're just going to we're just going to
[10:49] cut you off cut off your uh
[10:53] support this is what monin Bean said he
[10:56] said so I'm not a Jew with trembling
[11:01] knees we didn't ask for your help at The
[11:04] Six Day
[11:06] War we haven't asked your help when they
[11:09] killed six million of
[11:11] us in oswit and all the different places
[11:14] in Germany so we don't need to ask for
[11:17] your help
[11:19] now go Israel go Israel the only the
[11:24] only thing that's keeping us afloat is
[11:27] that we are giving Aid to Israel CU
[11:29] remember the Bible says whoever blesses
[11:31] Israel will be blessed well when we
[11:32] start cutting off Aid then guess what
[11:34] folks it's getting
[11:36] close and that's what Joe Biden wanted
[11:39] to do in ' 82 and that's what Joe
[11:40] Biden's wanted to do now so uh um but do
[11:43] you think the Jews care I don't think
[11:45] they do they appreciate it I think they
[11:47] appreciate the help they appreciate the
[11:49] technology but I think they've got their
[11:51] a little of their own I kind of like
[11:53] their way of doing things they they
[11:54] don't even ask forgiveness later they
[11:57] just do it they don't have to go go to
[11:59] the United Nations and the security
[12:01] Council and ask no they just go and do
[12:02] it but we know that God's with those
[12:05] people over there there's got to be a
[12:07] country of Israel a state of Israel
[12:10] there's got to be a place where the
[12:12] 144,000 has got to be taught and
[12:14] preached to and and able to hear the
[12:17] gospel and and they'll be there and I
[12:19] believe they're there now like I said
[12:21] before so um just something that was
[12:23] that came up I was watching brother Ron
[12:25] Spencer and he was reading it and he was
[12:27] kind of chuckling a little bit about it
[12:29] that uh you know they don't need our
[12:31] help they don't need our help they
[12:34] they're doing fine theirself so remember
[12:36] there's coming Sunday second service
[12:38] will be worship service uh June the 2nd
[12:41] as brother Ryan said Brother Richard
[12:42] Wilson will be here we'll have a regular
[12:44] service and then an ordination service
[12:46] right after that and then we'll have a
[12:47] meal and fellowship after that as far as
[12:50] I know his whole church is coming that
[12:52] can come so most of his family and the
[12:54] and some of the church members are all
[12:57] coming for the weekend then remember uh
[13:00] July 19th through 21st if you remember
[13:03] last year we went to um went to Brother
[13:07] Andre's and uh we stayed in the motel
[13:09] we're trying to look for airbnbs and
[13:11] places how many of you now not binding
[13:14] but just raise your hand if you're
[13:15] thinking about
[13:16] going just if you're thinking about
[13:18] going raise your
[13:23] hand 12 all
[13:26] right remember 12 and and I don't think
[13:29] we're going to have a service here I
[13:30] think we're going to stream from there
[13:32] and and then uh just not have a service
[13:34] here so we can all be up there we'd love
[13:36] for you to go we'll do the best we can
[13:38] to help you like I said before we're
[13:40] trying to find big Airbnb airbnbs where
[13:42] we can stay you know a lot of people can
[13:44] stay together and we don't have to go to
[13:47] uh uh we had to go all the way to
[13:48] Johnson City to stay last time and uh
[13:51] and that was a little bit of a travel
[13:53] time but just uh if you want to come
[13:55] I'll announce this again Sunday and I'll
[13:57] put a thing downstairs that that uh we
[14:00] sure wish all of you you would go and
[14:02] we'll help you the best way we can to
[14:05] get there all right I have one quote I
[14:08] have given God one million reasons to
[14:10] hate
[14:11] me and he still hadn't changed his mind
[14:13] about
[14:15] me praise God I don't know who that
[14:18] quote came from but it's a good one I've
[14:21] given God a million reasons to hate me
[14:23] and he still hasn't changed his mind
[14:25] about me cuz remember God can't change
[14:27] his mind
[14:30] amen let's bow our heads Lord Jesus
[14:34] thank you for this time that we have to
[14:35] meet in the middle of the week father I
[14:37] pray that You' be with us now in the

[15:04] the Lord Jesus father just forgive us of
[15:06] our sins and just be a help in time of
[15:08] trouble in Jesus name we pray amen we're
[15:11] going to talk a little bit about the
[15:13] sard sardian church age now we're in
[15:15] church age number uh
[15:18] five we got six and seven to go so we're
[15:21] getting close but the Ser s Ean Church
[15:23] age let's read Revelations 1:10 says I
[15:25] was in the spirit on the Lord's Day
[15:27] heard behind me a great voice as it was
[15:29] a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega
[15:31] the first and the last what thou seest
[15:33] write in a book and send it to these
[15:35] seven churches which we're going to look
[15:37] at here in just a minute go through some
[15:39] of them again but he turned to see the
[15:41] voice and what he turned he saw an image
[15:44] he saw an image of a man it was the son
[15:46] of man but he was in Bride form and
[15:48] that's what we're looking at today is is
[15:51] is there is no place cuz we're going to
[15:54] get to something in just a few minutes
[15:56] there's no place God is like he is in
[15:59] his bride now God's God God's
[16:03] good as I told them up there in the in
[16:06] Ohio I said God's grace is
[16:09] sufficient but there ain't no gree in it
[16:12] there ain't no gree in Grace no you
[16:15] don't slide by all right but we do
[16:18] believe in grace and the grace of God
[16:19] gave us seven Messengers that brought
[16:22] seven messages that we can look back and
[16:24] and it can I hope it's helping you it's
[16:26] helping me to even study this about some
[16:28] of the ones that have come up during
[16:30] that time and the people it was the
[16:32] people in that age folks you had one
[16:34] messenger but then you had the people
[16:36] that had to accept that message and
[16:38] there was a people there that accepted
[16:40] it just like now there's a people here
[16:42] to accept the message in the end time
[16:44] and in the midst of that seven candles
[16:45] state was one liking to the son of man
[16:47] clothed with a garment down to the foot
[16:49] and G about the PPS up here with a
[16:52] golden gird you may be seated Lord has
[16:54] his Blessing to the reading of the word
[16:59] let's look re read Revelations
[17:03] 3:1 and the angel of the church in
[17:05] Sardis now this is a sardian church age
[17:08] we know who the messenger was he was one
[17:10] of the most popular Messengers and his
[17:12] name was Martin Luther and he is the
[17:15] father or founder of the Reformation all
[17:19] right remember they were
[17:22] reformers all right they were not
[17:24] restorers they were reformers all right
[17:28] but they had a
[17:29] they had a part to play these things
[17:32] sayith he that hath the seven spirits of
[17:34] God and the Seven Stars I Know Thy works
[17:36] that thou Hast a name that thou livest
[17:37] now here he goes back to works again
[17:39] we're going to talk about back up a
[17:40] minute for the church age before that
[17:42] thou Hast a name that thou livest and
[17:45] are dead we'll get to that Sunday Be
[17:48] watchful and strengthen the things which
[17:50] remain that are ready to die that are
[17:52] ready to die for I have not found thy
[17:54] works perfect see there's a group of
[17:57] people that comes out of that other
[17:58] Church age into this church age that
[18:01] have works but they're not
[18:04] perfect right in other words what's
[18:06] going to happen is first three Church
[18:09] ages you didn't have a lot of different
[18:10] ideas but they were coming in but once
[18:13] you get into that middle Church age man
[18:15] that's when Rome took over that's when
[18:17] you had to do what they said that's when
[18:19] it was called the Inquisition it was
[18:20] called the Dark Ages it was called all
[18:22] these different things the Crusades
[18:24] everything was wound around the Catholic
[18:27] church and the people against the
[18:28] Catholic Church all right so coming out
[18:30] of that Luther didn't take those things
[18:33] and he didn't throw them out he brought
[18:35] some with him so God's telling him said
[18:38] hey I know your works but I got somewhat
[18:41] against you because what you're doing
[18:42] you got a name that you're living but
[18:43] you're dead and you're not perfect
[18:45] before God but now remember in this
[18:47] church age folks we have to be perfect
[18:51] our works have to be perfect everything
[18:53] has to be perfect everybody with me oh I
[18:56] can't do that well you need to find
[18:58] somewhere you can cuz the Bible says
[19:00] that we need to be be be therefore
[19:02] perfect and that a five-fold Ministry
[19:04] was given for thee what perfecting of
[19:07] the Saints remember therefore how thou
[19:10] Hast received and heard and hold fast
[19:12] and repent if therefore Thou shalt not
[19:14] watch I will come on thee as a thief
[19:17] Thou shalt not know what hour I will
[19:18] come upon thee thou Hast a few names
[19:21] even in SST which have not defile their
[19:23] garments and they shall walk with me and
[19:25] white for they're worthy praise God
[19:27] there's always in every Church there's a
[19:29] worthy group of people all right just
[19:31] like you just like
[19:33] you they sit and listen to a message and
[19:36] they accepted that message they Liv that
[19:38] message and then they passed
[19:40] on and they're waiting on me and you to
[19:42] get them out of the
[19:44] ground praise the Lord for they are
[19:47] worthy he that overcometh the same shall
[19:49] be clothed in white rment and I will not
[19:50] blot out his name out of the book of
[19:53] life but I will confess his name before
[19:55] my father and before his angels he that
[19:57] hath a near let him hear what the Spirit
[19:59] saith to the churches now we've come to
[20:01] the church age now we got one two and
[20:03] three which was under the lion anointing
[20:06] the middle age is the what the ox we'll
[20:08] get back to it in just a second now the
[20:10] next AG the next two ages and we're
[20:13] going to see this was the man anointing
[20:16] or the intelligence
[20:19] anointing of I I was looking up a few
[20:22] minutes ago you see that sardian church
[20:24] age lasted from 1520 to
[20:26] 1750 that's probably one of the greatest
[20:30] ages of man putting things together
[20:33] number one the printing press was made
[20:35] and that just changed everything you had
[20:37] to have no scribes anymore you could put
[20:39] the print and press and you could sit
[20:40] there and print all the paper you wanted
[20:41] to print not like what we do today but
[20:44] it was the beginning of what we do today
[20:46] all right so it was very important to
[20:48] have the pr and press because that's
[20:50] where these Bibles come from all right
[20:53] so that was one thing and then there was
[20:55] some other things that they did during
[20:57] that time which shows the man anointing
[20:59] or the intelligence of man we know the
[21:01] intelligence of man out there is killing
[21:03] us but there's an intelligence of God of
[21:06] knowledge in the church in the Statue of
[21:08] perfect man that's good for us all right
[21:11] and Martin Luther had the knowledge that
[21:13] the just shall live by faith and someone
[21:15] grabbed that knowledge and took that
[21:16] knowledge and went on through the whole
[21:18] church age without him being there the
[21:20] whole time just like we saw with Columba
[21:24] all right so this is the the ox age
[21:27] we're getting out of
[21:29] into the man and then remember the last
[21:31] one is the eagle anointing and that's
[21:33] what we're going to get to maybe in a
[21:35] few weeks and I really want to get to
[21:38] that because I want to cover a lot of
[21:39] things that that um I just put this in
[21:42] your mind um each one of these Church AE
[21:46] Messengers had a message
[21:48] right distinct
[21:51] message Paul arenus Martin Columba
[21:55] Luther Wesley and then Pentecost and
[21:58] then the prophet of God but remember he
[22:00] had a two-fold
[22:04] message these others
[22:06] didn't all right the reformers
[22:09] definitely didn't they were just trying
[22:10] to reform people and watch the re watch
[22:13] the Reformation it was bringing it or a
[22:16] protesting of the Catholic church that's
[22:18] why Martin Luther is so important
[22:20] because he stood up one day and said hey
[22:22] we're not going to do this anymore 900
[22:25] years Rome had ruled and finally one man
[22:29] that come out of their
[22:31] system God put him right in the middle
[22:34] of their system and he walked out and
[22:36] said nope we ain't doing that no
[22:39] more the Bible says the just shall live
[22:42] by the faith of God not no venience not
[22:45] Penance and all these different things
[22:47] so praise God we had a anointing but now
[22:50] in the end time brother random had two
[22:53] messages messages to bring why he said
[22:56] he did right he will read it in the
[22:59] church age book messenger Malachi 4 does
[23:01] two things what turn the hearts of the
[23:03] children back
[23:04] to he's got to turn us back to the faith
[23:08] of the fathers right there he's got to
[23:11] turn us back to the I say religion but
[23:13] he's got to turn us back to the doctrine
[23:15] of the pure doctrine of the first church
[23:17] age because it got eroded eroded got
[23:20] almost blacked out Rome took
[23:24] over uh Martin
[23:28] you know he pulled a little out Luther
[23:31] pulled a little out Wesley pulled a
[23:33] little out but they left Loose Ends they
[23:35] left things back over here like there's
[23:37] a name that you're called but you're
[23:39] dead what a father son Holy Ghost
[23:41] baptism that God Winks at their
[23:43] ignorance but it was
[23:45] dead took a prophet to tell us that was
[23:48] dead to restore all those things back so
[23:51] we'll get to that in a in a little bit
[23:53] where brother randam does those two
[23:55] things and you can see it distinctly in
[23:57] his message where he does does it and
[23:59] how he does it all
[24:02] right so now let's
[24:04] read the previous age and to the angel
[24:07] of the Church of thy high right these
[24:08] things sayith the Son of God who ha his
[24:10] eyes like into flame of fire and his
[24:12] feet like fing brass I Know Thy Works in
[24:15] charity as we were talking about last
[24:17] Sunday or Sunday before Wednesday before
[24:20] I Know Thy Works in charity now listen
[24:22] God knows cuz he set this whole thing
[24:25] up all right he put the man on on the
[24:29] scene so he's the one that's doing this
[24:31] he's the one that's writing this
[24:33] actually this should all be in red cuz
[24:35] remember God is telling this to John to
[24:38] write down all right I Know Thy Works in
[24:41] charity and service in faith and thy
[24:43] patience and thy works and the last to
[24:45] be more than the first notwithstanding I
[24:47] have a few things against thee because
[24:49] thou sufferest that woman Jezebel in
[24:52] other words they didn't do away with her
[24:54] right they suffered her in other words
[24:56] they kind of said oh I'm going to turn
[24:58] my head for a little
[25:01] Prestige which calleth herself a
[25:03] prophetess to teach and seduce my
[25:04] servants to commit fornication and to
[25:07] eat things sacrificed un Idols unto
[25:09] idols and I gave her space to repent
[25:11] everywhere you see God gives him a space
[25:13] to
[25:14] repent and she repented
[25:17] not behold I will cast her into a bed
[25:20] and then that commit adultery with her
[25:21] into Great Tribulation except they
[25:23] repent here we go again except they
[25:25] repent of their deeds and I will kill
[25:27] her children with death that's what we
[25:29] were talking about last time death
[25:31] coming out of death and we'll look up
[25:33] look at another little point I missed in
[25:35] just a few minutes and all the churches
[25:37] shall know that I am he that searcheth
[25:38] the Reigns in heart I will give unto
[25:40] every one of you according to your works
[25:43] all right but unto you I say and to the
[25:45] rest in th as many as have not this
[25:48] Doctrine praise God somebody's not going
[25:50] to take the doctrine of bam and the
[25:53] doctrine of Jezebel they're going to be
[25:55] separated group we're going to out the
[25:58] doctrines of this message and be a
[26:04] SE well praise God it doesn't it happens
[26:07] anyway as many as have not this Doctrine
[26:10] in which have not known the depths of
[26:12] Satan as they
[26:14] speak I will put upon you none other
[26:17] burden but that which you already have
[26:21] hold fast till I come listen whatever
[26:24] you got tonight hold fast to it until he
[26:27] comes and gives you some more
[26:29] hold to what you got if it Ain a thread
[26:31] hang on to that thread if it's a notot
[26:34] if it's the end of a rope TI knot and
[26:35] hang
[26:37] on cuz listen we as Believers we've got
[26:40] to start believing that's what God said
[26:43] that's it believing and doing remember
[26:46] faith without works is
[26:48] dead you say I got all Faith you can say
[26:50] I got all works well let's put them
[26:52] together let's let our faith
[26:56] work and he overcometh and keepeth my
[26:59] words now here here we go to my words
[27:03] unto the end to him will I give power
[27:06] over the Nations and he shall rule them
[27:07] with a rod of iron as the vessel of a
[27:09] Potter shall they be broken to Shivers
[27:11] he even as I received of my father and
[27:13] this is Jesus talking and I will give
[27:15] him the Morning Star he that hath in ear
[27:17] let him hear what the spirit says to the
[27:19] churches now remember the th Ty just for
[27:22] a background the tharan church age was
[27:23] the longest it was 606 to 1520 900 years
[27:28] years of Rome ruling the
[27:33] world now
[27:36] remember she's going to be killed with
[27:39] death but it's not going to be the death
[27:42] that you and I are thinking about in
[27:44] other words if somebody passes on we
[27:46] don't see him
[27:48] anymore until the resurrection
[27:50] right well these demons didn't die they
[27:54] just
[27:56] hid that's right
[27:59] when Luther and Wesley started reforming
[28:02] the church those the Roman Catholic
[28:04] Church never died it got stronger that's
[28:07] right it started harboring all the gold
[28:09] it started buying churches it started
[28:11] buying property that's when it began
[28:14] listen when God moves Satan
[28:16] moves but Satan can't move till God lets
[28:19] him and God allowed that church 900
[28:23] years to take over and a false Doctrine
[28:26] killed 68 million
[28:30] Christians for 900 years that's why this
[28:33] is the ox age or the ox anointing it's
[28:36] the labor you're not going to win a race
[28:38] with an
[28:39] ox but you sure can plow a garden with
[28:42] it
[28:44] amen got some
[28:46] horsepower so that's what it was in that
[28:48] that church age they had horsepower and
[28:51] the Bible even tells us that the last is
[28:53] going to be better than the first now
[28:55] this is where you and I are going to get
[28:56] a rebuke in just a minute we did the the
[28:58] other day but I want you to really look
[28:59] at it they were
[29:01] stronger in and after their persecution
[29:05] than they were in the beginning now
[29:08] listen that's almost humanly impossible
[29:10] I said it's humanly
[29:13] impossible for you to say pour it on
[29:15] Lord I ain't had
[29:17] enough no as soon as we get a toothache
[29:19] we go stop the
[29:22] program amen but they got stronger they
[29:26] held closer together toward the end
[29:30] that's what you and I have got to do we
[29:32] got to hold together stronger toward the
[29:34] end if not some's not going to make
[29:41] it and it all comes down to another
[29:44] thing called a dominating female and we
[29:46] know that female dominated really from
[29:48] the first church age all the way into
[29:50] this church age right here it just came
[29:52] from Diana into this one is in this
[29:54] church age and then it culminates with
[29:57] the hor inter children all right in this
[29:59] church age all right but it also means
[30:01] continual sacrifice you and I need that
[30:04] Ox anointing just to get up in the
[30:06] morning to go to
[30:08] work just to make it through the day and
[30:11] listen they made it
[30:14] through right so we got to put that
[30:17] state down like we like many of you did
[30:19] during the baptismal service last year
[30:22] Drive I mean drive it
[30:24] down I've driven one down I got to drive
[30:27] some more
[30:30] I can't just get one great big one I got
[30:32] have a bunch of little ones but drive it
[30:35] down and go on we can't go backwards
[30:38] this church AE did not go backwards even
[30:41] though they said I'm a Christian and
[30:43] they got put in the line's
[30:45] Den we've not been through that
[30:48] before the messenger was Columba he was
[30:51] born in 521 and died in 597 and he was
[30:54] born in the country of Ireland right
[30:57] there where brother George Quinn lives
[30:59] and dony go so let's look I Know Thy
[31:01] Works in charity and service and faith
[31:03] and thy patience and thy Works listen
[31:06] there's nothing wrong with works if it
[31:07] has Faith to build on top
[31:10] of I I tell you as I said before many
[31:14] examples you've seen them and I've seen
[31:16] them you get somebody that wants to do
[31:19] everything give me a list brother I'll
[31:21] paint your house ain't none of y'all
[31:23] ever done that I'll paint your house
[31:26] I'll wash your car
[31:29] right this church is really strange you
[31:32] know I think about this the other
[31:35] day but uh you know when we always go
[31:39] out and
[31:40] eat usually you buy the preacher food
[31:43] usually that's the way it works in other
[31:45] churches people buy the preacher food
[31:48] well in this
[31:49] church brother Dell's always bought your
[31:54] food hello right it is
[31:58] amen just but that's just the way he
[32:02] is and that's all right but don't try to
[32:06] work yourself into it don't say well now
[32:07] brother wait I I and I'll let
[32:12] you I got a lot of things I go over and
[32:14] sit with Dad for today for like four
[32:16] hours in the house and it's just
[32:18] beautiful outside and I got a hundred
[32:20] things I need to do but we're taking
[32:22] care of him first but if you want to
[32:24] come pressure wash my
[32:26] house pressure wash
[32:28] pile somewhere underneath that two car
[32:31] garage that ain't a car ever been in I
[32:33] Know Thy works and charity and service
[32:35] and faith and thy patience and thy works
[32:37] and they said it
[32:39] twice so listen works is not bad but
[32:42] like I said Works has to have a purpose
[32:44] besides trying to work your way into
[32:47] heaven cu the Bible tells us in
[32:49] Revelations that those that are standing
[32:51] before the white Throne judgment have to
[32:53] be what judged by their works if you're
[32:56] a born again Christian today you don't
[32:58] have to stand because you're not judged
[32:59] by your Works you're judged by Christ
[33:02] Works what he did for you at the cross
[33:05] that's the whole thing that's going to
[33:06] keep you out of that amen so get born
[33:09] again work on that don't work on other
[33:12] stuff work on getting born
[33:14] again if you never show up in my house
[33:16] to do nothing get born
[33:20] again I'm not laughing get born
[33:24] again it's hard enough not being born
[33:27] again
[33:29] we've all lived that hello we weren't
[33:31] all born born again born born again we
[33:34] were born dead
[33:37] right notwithstanding I have a few
[33:40] things against thee because thou
[33:41] sufferest that woman Jezebel which calls
[33:44] herself a prophetess to teach and seduce
[33:46] my servants my servants she's in the
[33:49] church that Jezebel system and it's
[33:52] still there now right and it could be
[33:54] here if we don't drive that thing out
[33:56] right amen which calleth herself a
[33:59] propheus now she didn't call herself a
[34:01] at that time hello she called
[34:03] herself a prophet prophetess and in this
[34:06] age we're going to see that there was a
[34:07] prophetess that sat on a three-leg stool
[34:10] and prophesied a three-leg stool kind of
[34:12] strange and to seduce my servants to
[34:15] commit fornication and eat things
[34:17] sacrificed into Idols I give her space
[34:19] to repent and she repented not I give
[34:22] her space he gave
[34:26] Jezebel space to repent right he gave
[34:32] Cain a space to
[34:34] repent he gave Judas a place to repent
[34:39] he gave Adolf Hitler somewhere in Adolf
[34:41] Hitler's life God came to him and he
[34:43] didn't he turned it down if not then
[34:46] he's just not a perfect God he's a
[34:50] perfect God he knows what he's doing he
[34:51] he he's not a respector of
[34:54] persons at one point in time in your
[34:56] life he thought no more of you than did
[34:58] off Adolf Hitler except for that part in
[35:00] his mind that back part in the vision
[35:03] part when he saw you before the
[35:04] foundation of the world now that is
[35:08] eternal that never had a beginning that
[35:10] never had an end that never had an
[35:12] account we had an
[35:15] account hello we had an account until we
[35:19] got born again we had an account cuz you
[35:21] know what you weren't no
[35:24] count that's right people in know how
[35:26] may don't understand that language but
[35:28] you weren't no count we
[35:33] weren't behold I will cast her into a
[35:36] bed and then to commit an adultery with
[35:37] her into Great Tribulation except they
[35:39] repent of their deeds and I will kill
[35:42] her children with death that's kind of a
[35:44] strange statement that we talked about
[35:45] the other day I will kill her children
[35:48] with death usually if you kill something
[35:52] it
[35:53] dies but he says I'm going to kill her
[35:56] children with death usually you kill it
[35:58] with a gun or you kill it with a run
[36:00] over it or you kill it with a bat or you
[36:01] kill it with something he's going to
[36:03] kill he's GNA kill the children with
[36:06] death we'll read that in just a minute
[36:08] and all the churches shall know that I
[36:10] am he which searcheth the Reigns in the
[36:12] hearts and I will give to every one of
[36:13] you according to what your Works listen
[36:16] your Works does
[36:19] matter amen that's
[36:22] right like that brother said he says are
[36:25] we Standing on the Promises or sitting
[36:27] on the pr
[36:28] one of the
[36:29] two but unto you I say un to the rest in
[36:32] thra as many as have not this Doctrine
[36:34] and which have not known the depths of
[36:35] Satan as they speak look I will put no
[36:38] burden there's there's a group of people
[36:40] here again that God has
[36:43] Sanctified to hold their
[36:45] self to keep their self and God's not
[36:48] going to put no more on you than you can
[36:50] stand you think oh no I don't believe
[36:52] that listen has God ever made a
[36:55] mistake I told him up here in Ohio I
[36:57] said and and this is a a kind of a
[36:59] carnal analogy but check your
[37:04] boxes right be practical for a minute
[37:07] check your
[37:09] boxes God's mad at me or I don't have
[37:12] any Liberty and I don't check your
[37:17] boxes do I love the
[37:20] Lord do I study more than I used
[37:23] to do I go to church more than I used to
[37:26] that's all important that's part of the
[37:28] Box do I pay TI the way I'm supposed to
[37:31] I mean come on you the little
[37:33] things ain't it the little things what
[37:35] bothers you the big thing sometimes like
[37:37] like Bob's got a great big they've got a
[37:39] great big um uh how many people how many
[37:41] how many did you say how many lawyers
[37:43] was down
[37:44] there good
[37:47] G and you got one born- again believer
[37:50] sitting right in the middle of
[37:52] it 600
[37:55] lawyers he's got a burden
[37:58] amen he's got a burden because what
[38:00] happens is all that see they do works
[38:03] and they do it under something
[38:04] else come on they're working every day
[38:07] to get money from other people right but
[38:10] brother Bob's kind of in there trying to
[38:12] make sure everything runs good well he
[38:14] has wor but his wor is going to take him
[38:17] somewhere and so is
[38:19] theirs so wor is not bad it's just how
[38:23] you do it who you do it
[38:25] for check your boxes do you ask God
[38:29] before you do
[38:30] something seek ye first the kingdom of
[38:33] heaven there's a box there
[38:35] somewhere so if you're having trouble
[38:38] check your
[38:39] boxes make sure everything's fine
[38:41] Brother Brown said look didn't he say he
[38:42] said when you've done everything you
[38:44] know to do listen everything you know to
[38:48] do is in
[38:50] here when you do everything you know to
[38:53] do what brother R say do he said stand
[38:55] right there stand right there there and
[38:58] he said watch God work then Abraham
[39:01] tried for 25 years to have a child and
[39:04] when he finally got to a place he said
[39:05] Lord you going to have to do it cuz I
[39:07] can't God changed his body and he did it
[39:09] all right that's what's going to happen
[39:11] to me and you I think we're trying to
[39:13] figure this thing out and sometimes we
[39:15] don't figure it out very well that's me
[39:19] included so we see this church
[39:23] age but that which you have already hold
[39:26] fast till I come other words if you got
[39:28] a little bit hang on to it and he that
[39:30] overcometh and keepeth now look my works
[39:33] now what's God's Works versus ours this
[39:35] is God's
[39:37] Works our works has to coincide with
[39:39] that but we have sometimes we have works
[39:41] that are outside of that I'm preaching
[39:44] to myself I
[39:45] guess so the ox age is the age of Works
[39:48] James 2:1 17 said even so faith if it
[39:51] hath not works is dead being
[39:55] alone right because Martin Luther were
[39:58] getting it we're setting it up for the
[40:00] next Church age what what is his his his
[40:03] his whole statement is the just shall
[40:06] live by
[40:09] works no works alone won't do it works
[40:13] alone is what Martin Luther did like in
[40:16] that movie when he was trying to do
[40:17] Penance he was crawling on the rocks and
[40:19] he was trying to beat himself and and do
[40:21] all that Penance that's works but he had
[40:24] no faith but now that God got a hold of
[40:27] him and gave him the New Birth come on
[40:29] somebody he saw that those Works were
[40:32] not the right ones but now now now the
[40:35] just shall live by the faith of God and
[40:39] the works will
[40:43] follow and listen it's not stuck in that
[40:46] church age it's right here
[40:50] tonight the just shall live by
[40:56] faith if so faith if had not works is
[40:58] dead being alone yeah a man may say thou
[41:00] Hast faith and I have Works show me thy
[41:03] faith without thy works and I will show
[41:05] you my faith by my works for as the body
[41:09] without the spirit is dead so faith
[41:11] without works now
[41:13] look you want me to you want me to put
[41:15] to put a scripture to that and explain
[41:18] that a little bit
[41:21] more Paul said you can have all the
[41:23] faith in the
[41:24] world Amen you know the mystery
[41:28] right huh right and not have what love
[41:32] to go with that
[41:35] Faith you put that faith and love
[41:37] together then something's going to
[41:39] happen so Faith then without work is
[41:42] dead also if you pull them apart
[41:47] right I think sometimes we have more
[41:49] faith than
[41:54] Google then we do in God
[42:01] right and how many times have you said
[42:03] it let's Google that or I Googled that
[42:06] or I looked it
[42:07] up why do we have to look up something
[42:10] you know I and don't get me wrong I like
[42:12] to watch other obviously I watch brother
[42:14] Ron Spencer and different ones and I
[42:16] watch the services and I'll do a little
[42:18] bit roundabout but if you sat there for
[42:21] three hours and watch James Dobson talk
[42:24] about how to be good
[42:29] faith without works you got to have
[42:31] faith in what somebody else said not
[42:33] what he said you got to have faith in
[42:35] what brother Brown God sent us a prophet
[42:36] to have faith in that man God sent us a
[42:39] five-fold Ministry to have faith in
[42:41] besides some man out there
[42:44] amen I'd rather sit you know all those
[42:47] great ones and I'm not they had their
[42:49] time they had their time Dwight Moody
[42:52] different ones I love and we're going to
[42:53] be able to sit down and talk to them cuz
[42:54] listen they were bride
[42:55] too but to take their message listen and
[42:59] I'm sorry but to take their message it's
[43:01] it's old carrying that's right it's left
[43:09] over people in this message eat a lot of
[43:11] dead
[43:12] carrying they can't get here because
[43:14] they stuck back there
[43:17] right waiting on signs and wonders and
[43:19] waiting on this and waiting on that the
[43:21] only person you better wait on is the
[43:23] Lord they that wait upon the Lord shall
[43:25] renew their strength not anybody else
[43:28] all
[43:29] right here again we find the same
[43:31] introduction introductory marks I know
[43:33] that works the Son of God himself
[43:35] believe me for the very Works sake he
[43:37] put an emphasis on his own Works while
[43:40] on Earth The Works that he did were
[43:42] ordained of God look to inspire faith in
[43:45] him brother brand the angel said brother
[43:48] BR get the people to believe
[43:50] you what is belief Faith have faith in
[43:54] you he said nothing will stand in your
[43:56] way not even
[44:00] cancer but it inspired faith in the
[44:04] people he said he'd say many times he
[44:06] said oh faith is building what this one
[44:09] was believing that one was believing
[44:11] this one was believing they getting out
[44:12] of their denominational ideas or they
[44:14] were waking up to what he was saying and
[44:17] then they had faith in what he
[44:18] done it was a great part of his ministry
[44:21] talking about Jesus so was it brother
[44:23] brandham his Holy Spirit and the Apostle
[44:25] Paul said for we are his workmen ship
[44:27] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[44:30] good works which God hath ordained that
[44:32] we should walk in them what the good
[44:34] works that he has Ephesians
[44:36] 2:10 these Works were to inspire faith
[44:39] in him as they would show forth that
[44:41] relationship to him that Paul described
[44:43] as created in him now works will never
[44:47] take the place of faith in God for our
[44:49] Salvation all right everybody with me
[44:51] but works will show forth our faith
[44:54] already placed in him
[44:57] right good works won't save
[45:00] you but they will come forth out of a
[45:03] saved
[45:04] life as fruit unto the
[45:07] Lord I believe in good works even if a
[45:10] man is not saved he ought to do good
[45:12] works and do the best he can what is
[45:14] horrible in the sight of God though is
[45:16] for men to do evil works and then they
[45:18] say they're doing the will of God and
[45:20] that's what's happening in this church
[45:21] age the Roman Catholic Church are
[45:23] standing and we'll get to it we won't
[45:25] get to it tonight maybe but man in this
[45:27] next age in the age of Luther's age
[45:30] there was a transition and it came there
[45:33] all these were uh you know how the
[45:35] Catholic says that Mary was was
[45:37] resurrected number one she's the mother
[45:39] of God she was resurrected and she
[45:42] ascended she ascended just like Jesus
[45:44] did so according to the Catholic Church
[45:46] all right well we're going to see in
[45:48] this NE in this age those seeds that are
[45:51] being planted because it started with a
[45:54] mother child worship
[45:57] and ended up and took child out and it
[45:59] was just a
[46:00] mother right so they exalt Mary though
[46:03] and don't exalt Jesus
[46:06] Christ Satan's slick but he's not as
[46:09] slick as a
[46:10] prophet he's not as slick as a prophet
[46:12] and he's not as slick as a prophetic
[46:14] people you and I are prophetic people we
[46:17] should have prophetic insight as brother
[46:19] Ram said we should be able to know these
[46:21] Mysteries and know listen and know what
[46:23] to do with them there's your words don't
[46:25] have just don't just have Fai faith in
[46:27] this
[46:29] message don't get quiet don't just have
[46:33] faith have Works to show
[46:38] it they're working theirself to death
[46:40] out there to get
[46:43] nowhere
[46:44] dead but they work work work work work
[46:48] trying to work their way into heaven
[46:49] some of them may get there because
[46:51] they're going to have to stand before
[46:52] the wi throne and give a account of
[46:54] their
[46:55] works but you're going to a group of
[46:57] people though that we'll get to in the
[46:59] last Church age and I'll read it where
[47:01] there's a people that stands up and says
[47:03] have I
[47:05] not cast out devils in your name have I
[47:09] not done these Great Mighty works in
[47:11] your name and God's going to say depart
[47:14] from you I never knew you now that's
[47:15] going to be strange for you to
[47:17] understand I know we do understand it
[47:19] but it's kind of hard to
[47:21] comprehend that you can have a man up
[47:23] here and he can be casting out Devils
[47:24] right and left by the hand of God cuz
[47:26] Satan can't cast out
[47:28] Satan but him be just as black on the
[47:30] inside and go to
[47:32] hell wow and that's what we get into
[47:35] because anointing ones at the end time
[47:37] in this verse he is commending his
[47:39] children because they were living
[47:40] changed lives their Works testified to a
[47:44] new spirit within and Ruth's not here
[47:47] tonight just Ruth but God bless her and
[47:51] I hope Robbie watches this but I told
[47:54] her I said you know what or his sister
[47:57] sitting right here
[47:58] so she knows what I'm talking about I'll
[48:02] promise you when God gets a hold of that
[48:03] guy everybody will know
[48:08] it everybody will know
[48:11] it but that was the same way with a lot
[48:14] of
[48:14] us everybody knew when God got a hold of
[48:17] us I hope so I hope you've
[48:22] changed but Robbie's got it coming he'll
[48:26] never see this
[48:27] but he's got it coming cuz he's had the
[48:31] blood applied to him his wife drove a
[48:33] state down and she wants him as a
[48:35] husband that's born again sitting beside
[48:37] how many of us want that to happen in
[48:39] all our lives we want our kids sitting
[48:42] here we want our parents sitting here we
[48:45] want our brothers and sisters sitting
[48:48] here my word if people that had come to
[48:51] church here will come back to church
[48:53] here we will have to build on
[48:57] that's how Wayward that we've seen them
[49:00] leave well now let's see them come
[49:02] back this is the end
[49:05] time well listen put your faith to work
[49:08] right amen put your faith to work all
[49:11] they're getting worse and
[49:14] worse
[49:16] so
[49:19] so your face got to be stronger at the
[49:22] end than it is at the beginning
[49:27] in this verse he's commenting his CH
[49:28] commending his children because they are
[49:30] living changed lives their Works
[49:32] testified to a new spirit within men saw
[49:36] their good works and glorified God yes
[49:38] sir if you are a Christian you are going
[49:40] to do what is
[49:45] right your Works will show that where
[49:48] your that your heart is right and it
[49:50] won't be something that you put on for
[49:53] you will do his will when no one but God
[49:57] sees
[49:58] you and you will do his will even if it
[50:01] cost you your life that's right how many
[50:04] of you has that resolve amen if it cost
[50:07] you listen this life is worth
[50:10] nothing kids we love we love I love life
[50:14] as much as the next person
[50:16] does but everything we touch is dead
[50:19] right exactly but if you'll get changed
[50:22] you'll see that your life will help
[50:24] other people change
[50:27] amen that's why we're here we're not
[50:29] here to be selfish what Brother D tell
[50:31] he said I know I got the new birth he
[50:33] said but first thing I want to do is
[50:34] give it away I want to give it you can't
[50:36] give yours away but you sure can't shine
[50:39] a light bright enough to where they'll
[50:41] see
[50:42] it cuz we'll see it in just a minute
[50:44] where the Bible says if that light in
[50:45] you be Darkness how great is that
[50:47] Darkness how deceptive it is that you're
[50:49] sitting in a church and you're dead as a
[50:53] Hammer Brother Ry priest works his faith
[50:57] expressed I know that works and the last
[50:59] to be more than the first now look this
[51:02] is certainly remarkable is what we're
[51:03] talking about as the darkness of the age
[51:05] increased now listen this age is going
[51:08] to Black completely
[51:12] out it's not going to get any better
[51:16] there's not a worldwide Revival for the
[51:18] Bride As far
[51:20] as building big churches and having big
[51:24] members that's right said fear not
[51:27] little
[51:31] flock this is certainly remarkable why
[51:33] is it remarkable like I said before Lord
[51:36] my tooth hurts I need two to I need two
[51:38] of my teeth to
[51:41] hurt y'all prayed that before hadn't you
[51:47] no well that's what it's
[51:51] saying they were more strong over here
[51:53] to end than they were to beginning and
[51:56] they looked back and saw 68 million of
[52:00] their brothers and
[52:01] sisters in the
[52:03] grave right but yet they became stronger
[52:07] and stronger and stronger what in their
[52:11] faith they worked all the harder as the
[52:14] darkness of the age increased as the
[52:15] honor role of the martyrs grew lengthier
[52:18] day by day they worked all the harder
[52:20] they served all the more and their faith
[52:24] increased now listen they weren't
[52:27] required to come to a body change you
[52:29] and I are required to take what we
[52:32] have right now today what you have today
[52:37] and take it to a body
[52:39] change that's our requirement so we
[52:41] better get into this attitude that it's
[52:43] going to get worse but it's going to be
[52:45] better when we get toward the end of
[52:47] this thing amen they worked all the
[52:49] harder they served all the more their
[52:51] faith increased how tragic it was that
[52:54] in the Ephesian Church age love Wayne
[52:57] and truly nothing is said of the
[52:58] increased labor of love in all the other
[52:59] Church ages but in this age in the
[53:02] darkest of all ages they served him even
[53:05] more what a lesson that is there's no
[53:08] ceasing of this gracious service of Love
[53:11] unto the Lord but rather an increasing
[53:13] of
[53:15] it that is the secret now you want to
[53:18] know the secret let the enemy attempt to
[53:21] thwart our service to the Lord our reply
[53:24] is increase service amen amen when the
[53:28] faint are crying in fear that is the
[53:30] time to shout the
[53:34] victory let's get that in our
[53:39] mind um brother uh Perry and them saying
[53:42] I what I'll praise you when it's all
[53:44] wonderful and my bed's wonderful and my
[53:47] and I got this great pillow and and I
[53:49] got a brand new Sleep Number bed and my
[53:52] number is the right number it's like
[53:55] 777 and
[53:59] now the song says I'll praise you in the
[54:02] storm I will lift my
[54:05] hands do we do
[54:08] that this age was trained to do that and
[54:10] we get a piece of this age folks it was
[54:13] the same holy ghost that that took them
[54:15] through that Ox age is sitting in you
[54:19] tonight all right let's go a little bit
[54:20] further I want to give you a warning
[54:22] right here he says concerning the last
[54:24] days that because of abounding iniquity
[54:26] the love of many will wax
[54:28] cold and to lay out to see in her last
[54:31] age self-love and love for material
[54:32] things will take the place of the true
[54:35] love of God we need to guard against the
[54:38] power of sin in these last days so many
[54:40] are getting so hard because they haven't
[54:42] realized the effect of this last day
[54:44] Spirit it is time to draw nigh to God
[54:47] and let him fill our lives with his love
[54:49] or we will fill the coldness of the last
[54:51] day church and reject the truth of God
[54:54] which alone is able to help us us reject
[54:57] the very thing that's able to help us
[54:59] amen Wow Let's don't get caught in that
[55:02] trap let's Praise Him in the storm
[55:05] whatever you're going
[55:06] through lift up your hands and praise
[55:09] him so now we see that the dominating
[55:12] female which is a church it started in
[55:15] Ephesus with Diana we covered that this
[55:17] th tyan age is a prophetess it SATs on a
[55:19] three-legged stool and
[55:22] prophesies and then our age it ends up
[55:25] with the great wh and her daughter
[55:27] so somewhere between all this it
[55:30] continues with the worship of a
[55:33] woman all right everybody with me all
[55:37] right like I said before brother randam
[55:40] he he he said he said you know you can
[55:42] have all the beard
[55:44] joints and a bad woman or or or a
[55:48] prostitute she'll send more people to
[55:50] hell then all these beard joints will
[55:51] now that's hard to understand but it's
[55:53] not cuz the Bible says you look on them
[55:56] now if you look on a woman to lust after
[55:59] you committ adultery with her already in
[56:01] your heart huh
[56:04] hello look on her to lust after her
[56:08] you've already committed adultery with
[56:10] her I'm just telling listen I Think
[56:12] Jesus said that that wasn't a brother
[56:14] Rand quote that was a Jesus quote
[56:16] everybody with
[56:17] me notwithstanding I have a few things
[56:20] against thee because thou sufferest that
[56:21] woman Jezebel which calleth herself a
[56:24] prophetess to teach and seduce my
[56:26] servants my servants to commit
[56:29] fornication and to eat things sacrific
[56:31] the idols unto idols and I give her
[56:33] space to repent of her fornication and
[56:35] she repented not listen he gave them 900
[56:38] years under the ministry of Columba he
[56:40] gave them 900 years to repent and turn
[56:44] around and go another way didn't
[56:47] happen that's right and I gave her space
[56:49] to repent of her fornication and she
[56:51] repented not behold I will cast her into
[56:53] a bed and them that commit adultery with
[56:55] her so there must be a widespread thing
[56:58] it's not just going to be an individual
[56:59] one little thing no it's going to be
[57:01] widespread commit adulter with her into
[57:03] Great Tribulation except they repent now
[57:05] there you go repent of their
[57:07] deeds repentance can go a long way if
[57:09] y'all don't know
[57:11] that Godly sorrow leaded us to leads us
[57:14] to repentance if you're really sorry for
[57:16] what you did there's only one thing you
[57:18] can't be forgiven for and that's
[57:20] blaspheming the Holy Ghost one thing I
[57:23] know we I know you can name all those
[57:25] other ones but I'm just telling you
[57:26] brother rown said the only thing that
[57:28] keep you out of Heaven is blaspheming
[57:31] the Holy Ghost I ain't saying bride and
[57:33] I ain't saying this or that he just said
[57:35] blaspheming the Holy Ghost is the only
[57:37] thing that keep you out everybody with
[57:39] me on that all right so let's just don't
[57:42] be too hard to judge every once in a
[57:43] while I know it's bad you have to pay
[57:46] your you have to pay your
[57:48] Penance you're not going to get away
[57:50] with
[57:51] it like I said God's grace is not greasy
[57:54] you can't slide around or under it but
[57:57] you will have to give an account and you
[58:00] will have that thing sitting on your
[58:02] shoulder all the time you will God won't
[58:05] but you will that's a paradox that
[58:08] you're a child of God you're growing in
[58:10] the Statue of perfect man and that thing
[58:13] that that that you did 25 years ago when
[58:16] you were out in the world it sits right
[58:18] there and reminds you of what you
[58:22] did what what did Brother R say do he
[58:25] said just remind the devil where he's
[58:26] going all right cuz remember he's the
[58:29] only one that sees it God doesn't see
[58:32] it do we really believe that amen do
[58:35] really believe that the blood's
[58:37] sufficient that that it cleanses us from
[58:38] all unrighteousness that it that we're
[58:40] going to be a Chase virgin that we're
[58:42] going to be presented to God without
[58:44] spot or wrinkle now how's that going to
[58:47] happen that's having faith in what God's
[58:49] already
[58:50] done and I will kill her children with
[58:52] death and all the churches shall know
[58:54] that I am he that searches the reign of
[58:56] heart and I will give unto every one of
[58:58] you according to your Works 1 Timothy
[59:01] 5:6 but she that liveth in pleasure is
[59:05] dead while she
[59:09] liveth let's don't be that way if you're
[59:12] not born again you're dead you can have
[59:15] all the whoop whoop up you know like
[59:16] brother B said that woman said boy this
[59:18] is life and drunk as a skunk and half
[59:20] clothes on she thought that was
[59:23] life when it was what it was death it
[59:25] was Kill her she just didn't know
[59:28] that think about a woman
[59:31] though here's a prophet standing in a
[59:33] motel room I mean a motel hallway and
[59:37] here's this woman goes comes crawling
[59:39] out she probably was away from her
[59:40] husband like she like you said and she
[59:42] was having a good time and she was
[59:44] probably at a convention or something
[59:46] and here she comes out of the room with
[59:47] half her clothes off with a bottle in
[59:48] her hand drunk as a skunk and said
[59:51] whoopee this is life and looks right
[59:52] into the
[59:54] face of a prophet
[59:58] and doesn't realize it never changed her
[1:00:01] one
[1:00:02] bit she was so into what she was doing
[1:00:04] never changed her one bit those beady
[1:00:07] eyes of that Prophet looked at her and I
[1:00:08] he probably wanted to condemn her but he
[1:00:11] probably prayed for her he probably
[1:00:13] walked in his room got on his knees and
[1:00:14] said God forgive that woman and and
[1:00:16] prayed for
[1:00:18] her do we do that or we kick them over
[1:00:21] the balcony and hope they don't land too
[1:00:24] soft what will be the punishment of the
[1:00:27] Harlot and her children well it's going
[1:00:29] to be twofold first he said I will cast
[1:00:31] her into a bed according to the last
[1:00:32] part of verse 22 it will be a bed of
[1:00:34] tribulation or Great Tribulation that is
[1:00:37] exactly what Jesus said in Matthew 25
[1:00:39] 1-3 because remember the 10 virgins five
[1:00:42] are wise and five are foolish those five
[1:00:43] foolish virgins they go through the
[1:00:45] tribulation period they're they're
[1:00:47] cleansed there they're not cleansed here
[1:00:49] you and I praise God we're cleansed here
[1:00:51] we're not cleansed there don't wait on
[1:00:54] something kids adults don't wait on
[1:00:58] something there were 10 virgins five
[1:01:01] were wise five were foolish the five
[1:01:02] wise had oil the Holy Spirit but the
[1:01:05] other five did not now remember they
[1:01:07] were
[1:01:08] virgins they went to church they served
[1:01:10] the Lord they did the best they could
[1:01:12] for what they had amen they weren't
[1:01:15] there's a there's one of them out
[1:01:18] there but these were 10 virgins Five
[1:01:19] Wives five
[1:01:20] foolish when the cry went out behold the
[1:01:23] bridegroom cometh the five foolish had
[1:01:24] run seek oil while the five five wise
[1:01:26] virgins went into the marriage the five
[1:01:28] that remained outside were left to the
[1:01:30] Great Tribulation that is what will
[1:01:31] happen to all who do not go in the
[1:01:34] Rapture that is what will come upon the
[1:01:36] Harlot and her daughters secondly it
[1:01:39] said that he will kill them with death
[1:01:42] or as a literal translation says let
[1:01:44] them be put to death with
[1:01:50] death this is a strange saying we might
[1:01:52] say let a man be put to death by hanging
[1:01:54] or by electrocution or some other way
[1:01:56] but this says let them be put to death
[1:01:59] by death death itself is the cause of
[1:02:03] their
[1:02:04] death if that light and you be Darkness
[1:02:08] how great is that
[1:02:11] Darkness I say
[1:02:13] here but I say the denominations they
[1:02:16] have no
[1:02:17] light they're trying some of them are
[1:02:19] trying the best they can and they're
[1:02:20] going to be part of the foolish virgin
[1:02:21] or they're going to be part even part of
[1:02:22] the hor system but giving eternal life
[1:02:24] because of their words of being to the
[1:02:26] bride and all that let's don't chance
[1:02:29] that let's don't chance
[1:02:31] that uh the lady Cuts our hair today she
[1:02:36] was uh talking about where the Bible
[1:02:39] says there the way the tree leans that's
[1:02:41] the way it's going to
[1:02:43] fall it don't change directions when you
[1:02:47] pass
[1:02:49] away brother Bram said if you're honor
[1:02:51] here You' be honor there
[1:02:56] now I want you see this clearly so I
[1:02:57] will take our illustration again of the
[1:02:59] daughter of Jezebel marrying into the
[1:03:01] house of Judah and thereby bring it
[1:03:02] right into idolatry and causing God to
[1:03:04] deliver Judah to death did you did you
[1:03:07] know that read your story even one of uh
[1:03:11] Jezebel's
[1:03:13] Sons can't remember his name but I think
[1:03:15] he's in here I put it in here she had
[1:03:18] him go do something and it just
[1:03:20] destroyed everything she listened to her
[1:03:22] mama oh I right I was preaching it this
[1:03:24] weekend on uh Mother's Day about how a
[1:03:28] mother are good and then that mother was
[1:03:32] bad and remember who was the one that
[1:03:34] that that caused her daughter to
[1:03:37] dance in front of Herod so that she
[1:03:39] could have John the Baptist head cut off
[1:03:42] she caused her daughter to do that told
[1:03:45] her daughter to do that Jezebel told her
[1:03:49] son to do that so there's some bad ones
[1:03:52] in there too
[1:03:57] that is what balum did too so here was
[1:03:59] Jezebel with her paganism over there's
[1:04:01] Judah properly worshiping God and living
[1:04:03] under the word so Jezebel marries her
[1:04:05] daughter to jehoram that's him jehoram
[1:04:08] the minute that happened jehoram caused
[1:04:10] the people to become idolators the
[1:04:13] minute that marriage took place Judah
[1:04:14] was
[1:04:17] dead that's why a mother can be the most
[1:04:20] nurturing and greatest thing but she can
[1:04:23] also remember what remember what Solomon
[1:04:26] said about a woman scorned or a brawling
[1:04:30] woman it was better to live with a cow
[1:04:31] on top of the house than it is with a
[1:04:33] brawling woman he ought to know he had a
[1:04:36] thousand
[1:04:38] wives and a thousand mother-in-laws the
[1:04:41] minute that marriage took place Judah
[1:04:43] was dead spiritual death came in listen
[1:04:45] spiritual death we ought to talk more
[1:04:48] about that because it's unseen to the
[1:04:51] common
[1:04:52] eye hello somebody regular death is
[1:04:56] pretty good I mean not good but it's
[1:04:57] common if somebody passes away you go to
[1:05:00] the funeral home you see them you close
[1:05:01] the casket you say a few words put them
[1:05:03] in the ground you don't see him anymore
[1:05:05] spiritual death you see him every single
[1:05:08] day and it gets worse and worse if that
[1:05:11] light and you be Darkness how great is
[1:05:13] that Darkness there's many
[1:05:16] people come on people that scripture
[1:05:18] that Jesus was referring to is message
[1:05:21] Believers right let me just put that
[1:05:24] stamp on and that's message Believers
[1:05:27] have I not cast out devils in your name
[1:05:30] have I not preached your word have I not
[1:05:32] done Mighty works in your
[1:05:34] name amen
[1:05:39] wow the minute the First Church of Rome
[1:05:41] organized it died the minute that the
[1:05:44] Lutheran organized have you seen again
[1:05:46] what in the world they're doing with the
[1:05:48] Methodist Church Heavenly days they're
[1:05:50] taking the Lord's Prayer out of
[1:05:52] everything now the ones that have the
[1:05:54] Gaze and all that stuff on in their pull
[1:05:55] pin they're taking that out of their
[1:05:57] whatever they say or their
[1:06:00] books cuz it's not
[1:06:03] inclusive it don't include all them
[1:06:05] other
[1:06:06] people the minute that the Lutheran
[1:06:08] organized death came in and they died
[1:06:10] the Pentecostals came along last and
[1:06:12] they organized now this is where he made
[1:06:14] a lot of people mad cuz those
[1:06:15] Pentecostals were sitting there in that
[1:06:17] service that's right the spirit left
[1:06:20] though they don't believe
[1:06:22] it but he did that marriage brought
[1:06:26] death then the light of the Oneness of
[1:06:29] the godhead came he's talking about now
[1:06:31] his
[1:06:33] message hello they organized and they
[1:06:36] died too then after the fire of God fell
[1:06:38] on the Ohio River in 33 a healing
[1:06:40] Revival swept the world but it never
[1:06:42] came through an organization remember it
[1:06:44] was apart from God went outside the
[1:06:47] Pentecostal group outside of
[1:06:48] organization and what he's doing what
[1:06:51] he's going to do in the future is going
[1:06:53] to be outside organization
[1:06:56] God can't work through the
[1:06:59] dead he can only work through the living
[1:07:03] members those living members are outside
[1:07:06] of Babylon so you see death or
[1:07:09] organization came and the church died or
[1:07:11] to make it pler death became the a
[1:07:17] resident what's a resident Bo when they
[1:07:21] renters move into your house now they're
[1:07:24] not all demons I know that's what you're
[1:07:26] thinking but they reside there okay cuz
[1:07:29] that's where they
[1:07:30] live death became a resident wherein
[1:07:33] shortly before only life had
[1:07:36] rained as the original Eve brought death
[1:07:39] to mankind so now organization has
[1:07:42] brought death for organization is the
[1:07:45] product of the double corruptors nism
[1:07:48] and bism
[1:07:51] propagated by Jezebel there's your
[1:07:54] Trinity
[1:07:57] what nician ISM bism Jezebel
[1:08:00] ISM Now Eve should have been burned
[1:08:02] along with a serpent for her awful deed
[1:08:04] but Adam intervened taking her quickly
[1:08:06] to himself so that she was saved but
[1:08:08] when this satanic religion has gone to
[1:08:11] the full course of the ages he's talking
[1:08:12] about now there will be no one to
[1:08:17] intervene and she will be burned with
[1:08:19] her Seducer for the and her
[1:08:20] children and the Antichrist and Satan
[1:08:22] will all find their places in the lake
[1:08:25] of
[1:08:26] fire Matthew 6:
[1:08:29] 21 for where your treasure is there will
[1:08:32] your heart be also the Light of the body
[1:08:34] is the eye if therefore thine ey be eye
[1:08:38] be single thy whole body shall be full
[1:08:41] of light wow but if thine eye be evil
[1:08:47] thy whole body shall be full of Darkness
[1:08:49] if therefore the light that is in thee
[1:08:51] be Darkness how great is that Darkness
[1:08:56] right if you think you're doing
[1:08:59] right and it be what
[1:09:02] wrong and you think I've got God I've
[1:09:04] got Jesus I've got this I've got that I
[1:09:07] I believe in a trinity I believe I'm
[1:09:09] talking about out there I father son
[1:09:10] Holy Ghost baptism oh yeah hell's
[1:09:12] Eternal no yeah oh yeah hell's
[1:09:14] Eternal all these different things that
[1:09:17] they go by that's
[1:09:18] dead there's nothing quickening you
[1:09:21] can't Quicken false
[1:09:23] word so as they you to carry false word
[1:09:27] there's no quickening power anywhere in
[1:09:29] it
[1:09:31] right I I hate it for those people but
[1:09:34] if they accept that system they become a
[1:09:36] part of
[1:09:39] it and if we accept this message and
[1:09:41] just accept it like it
[1:09:46] is we're just a part of
[1:09:50] it are we saying what's set on tape are
[1:09:53] we just repeating what's set on tape

[1:10:59] stick on the Sabbath day they took you

[1:11:05] appeal right cuz that man did he was
[1:11:07] picking up sticks and they took him out
[1:11:09] and killed
[1:11:10] him now that's
[1:11:13] death everyone that defileth it shall
[1:11:15] surely be put to death for whosoever
[1:11:17] doeth any work therein that Soul shall
[1:11:19] be cut off from among his people six

[1:11:36] commits adultery and his neighbor's wife
[1:11:39] the adulter and the adulteress shall
[1:11:41] both be put to death now listen that's
[1:11:45] law Leviticus 24 he that blasphemeth the
[1:11:48] name of the Lord we hear it every day he

[1:12:13] land when he blasphemeth the name of the
[1:12:14] Lord shall be put to
[1:12:17] death now let's go to Psalms 56 though
[1:12:19] say look for thou Hast delivered my soul
[1:12:22] from Death will not thou deliver my feet
[1:12:25] from falling that I may walk before God
[1:12:27] in the light of the living Psalms
[1:12:31] 116:15 precious in the sight of the Lord
[1:12:33] is the death of his
[1:12:36] Saints Proverbs 14:11 The House of the
[1:12:38] wicked shall be overthrown but the
[1:12:40] Tabernacle of the upright shall flourish
[1:12:42] watch there is a way which seeth right
[1:12:45] unto
[1:12:51] man but the end thereof are the ways of
[1:12:54] death
[1:12:57] they think they're doing right but it's
[1:12:58] killing
[1:13:01] them John 5 ver 24 said verely verily I
[1:13:04] say unto you he that Hearth my word and
[1:13:06] believeth on him that sent me hath
[1:13:07] everlasting life and shall not come into
[1:13:10] condemnation but is passed from that
[1:13:13] death unto
[1:13:15] Life John 8:51 barely verely I say unto
[1:13:18] you if a man keep my sayings oh wait a
[1:13:21] minute if a man keep my sayings he shall
[1:13:23] never see death now is he talking about
[1:13:26] natural is he talking about spiritual if
[1:13:29] he's talking about natural he
[1:13:31] lied but he's talking about spiritual he
[1:13:34] shall never see
[1:13:36] death then said the Jews unto him now we
[1:13:38] know thou H has a devil what teaching do
[1:13:41] this come from Abraham is dead and the
[1:13:43] prophets and thou sayth if a man keep my
[1:13:45] Saints he shall never taste of death
[1:13:47] they were speaking what carnally over
[1:13:48] here on this side but Jesus was speaking
[1:13:51] of heavenly of of not of not dying to
[1:13:54] death as he was talking about killing
[1:13:55] them with death acts 2:23 said him being
[1:13:59] delivered by the determinant counsel and
[1:14:00] for knowledge of God you have taken and
[1:14:03] by Wicked hands have crucified and slain
[1:14:05] whom God hath raised up having loosed
[1:14:07] the Pains of death because it was not
[1:14:10] possible that he should be holding of it
[1:14:12] acts 22:4 and I persecuted this way unto
[1:14:16] the death now that's Paul this is Paul
[1:14:19] the great Paul the great one that
[1:14:22] brought salvation to the Jews and then
[1:14:24] to the Gentiles
[1:14:27] he had people
[1:14:28] killed talk about
[1:14:34] Grace is that going to ever be held
[1:14:36] against
[1:14:37] him it
[1:14:40] can't but it was before he got born
[1:14:42] again he was under the law he was doing
[1:14:45] what the law said right same way with us
[1:14:49] Romans 6 ver8 now if we be dead with
[1:14:52] Christ we believe that we shall also
[1:14:53] live with him knowing that Christ Christ
[1:14:55] being raised from the dead dieth no more
[1:14:57] death hath no more dominion over him for
[1:15:00] in that he died he died under sin once
[1:15:02] but then he liveth he liveth unto God
[1:15:05] likewise reckon now watch Paul says
[1:15:07] likewise reckon
[1:15:09] yourself to be dead indeed unto sin but
[1:15:13] alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our
[1:15:14] Lord let not sin therefore reign in your
[1:15:18] look mortal
[1:15:20] body that you should obey it in the lust
[1:15:23] thereof
[1:15:25] in your mortal body let it don't let it
[1:15:27] rain in your body that you should obey
[1:15:29] it in the lust thereof neither yield ye
[1:15:32] your members as instruments of
[1:15:33] unrighteousness Unto sin but yield
[1:15:35] yourself unto God now he's talking to
[1:15:38] Christians hello somebody amen as those
[1:15:41] that are alive from the dead and your
[1:15:43] members as instruments of righteousness
[1:15:45] unto God for sin shall not have dominion
[1:15:48] over you for you are not under the law
[1:15:51] but watch but under
[1:15:53] grace what then now
[1:15:55] watch Paul's going to take the Greece
[1:15:57] out of it right here What then shall we
[1:16:00] sin because we are not under the law but
[1:16:02] under
[1:16:03] grace God
[1:16:05] forbid right know ye not that to whom
[1:16:08] you yield yourself servants to obey his
[1:16:10] servant you are to whom you obey whether
[1:16:13] of sin under death or of obedience under
[1:16:16] righteousness he's asking the question
[1:16:19] Romans 6: 211 what fruit had ye then in
[1:16:23] those things whereever you are now
[1:16:24] ashamed
[1:16:26] I'm going to ask you all that one more
[1:16:28] time Paul's not talking to
[1:16:30] himself he's not talking to the Romans
[1:16:32] tonight he's not talking to the Main
[1:16:35] Street Gospel over there he's talking to
[1:16:37] Spoken Word
[1:16:39] Church what fruit had ye when those
[1:16:42] things thereof ye are now asham whereof
[1:16:44] you are now ashamed for the end of those
[1:16:46] things is death but now being made free
[1:16:50] from sin and become servants to God you
[1:16:53] have your fruit under holiness and the
[1:16:55] end everlasting life for the wages of
[1:16:58] sin is death but the gift of God is
[1:17:01] eternal life through Jesus Christ Our
[1:17:02] Lord now listen we died the
[1:17:06] death in our
[1:17:08] soul as far as being a Christian
[1:17:11] remember the old man had to what
[1:17:14] die all right so we die the death
[1:17:16] already but God's going to take a group
[1:17:19] of people and he's going to kill them by
[1:17:21] the own doctrine that they live by right
[1:17:26] dead while they're
[1:17:27] living so let's look and see right here
[1:17:30] death by
[1:17:31] death and I will kill her children with
[1:17:33] death and all the churches shall know
[1:17:35] that I am he which serth the Reigns in
[1:17:36] heart and I will give unto every one of
[1:17:39] you according to your Works Romans
[1:17:41] 7:4 says wherefore my brethren you also
[1:17:44] are become dead to the law by the body
[1:17:46] of Christ all right so the committing
[1:17:49] adultery and all that we know that's
[1:17:50] wrong and that's bad but that's not a
[1:17:53] sin unto spiritual death death if you
[1:17:56] get it if you get it right and get born
[1:17:57] again but now you didn't have a chance
[1:17:59] to do that under the law folks right
[1:18:03] right you
[1:18:04] died period all right but remember as
[1:18:09] Paul tells us here in Romans he said the
[1:18:12] law in other words the law was
[1:18:16] there but now we're under
[1:18:19] grace all right wherefore my brethren
[1:18:22] you also are become dead to the law by
[1:18:24] the Body of Christ that you should be
[1:18:26] married to another even to him who is
[1:18:29] raised from the dead that we should
[1:18:31] bring forth fruit un God for when we
[1:18:34] were in the flesh the Motions of sin
[1:18:37] look which were by the
[1:18:40] law if you're not born again today you
[1:18:43] are living under the
[1:18:45] law and that is death it will kill you
[1:18:48] you can't come out from under the law
[1:18:50] the law says do this you're dead
[1:18:54] amen
[1:18:56] amen for when you were in the flesh the
[1:18:59] Motions of sin which were by the law did
[1:19:01] work in our members Paul's saying our
[1:19:05] members to bring forth fruit unto
[1:19:09] death but now we are delivered from the
[1:19:12] law that being dead wherein we were held
[1:19:16] all right we were dead under the law
[1:19:17] that we should serve in newness of
[1:19:19] spirit not in the oldness of the letter
[1:19:21] what shall we say then all right Paul's
[1:19:23] going to sum this up right here
[1:19:25] is the law sin God
[1:19:27] forbid nay I had not known sin but by
[1:19:31] the
[1:19:32] law for I had not known lust except the
[1:19:35] law said Thou shalt not
[1:19:37] covet but sin taking occasion by the
[1:19:40] Commandment wrought in me all man manner
[1:19:43] of concubines for without the law sin
[1:19:45] was
[1:19:46] dead for I was alive without the law
[1:19:50] Once Dead while he Liv for I was alive
[1:19:54] without law once in other words alive
[1:19:56] here not alive in his soul but when the
[1:19:58] Commandment came sin revived and I
[1:20:02] died and the Commandment watch which was
[1:20:05] ordained to life I found it to be death
[1:20:08] Paul took the
[1:20:10] law Saul sorry Saul took the law he took
[1:20:14] exactly what God
[1:20:16] said hello somebody he took exactly the
[1:20:20] Scrolls of what God Said and killed
[1:20:22] those people by it right or had him put
[1:20:25] to death made him blaspheme
[1:20:28] right from the book he didn't create his
[1:20:31] own
[1:20:33] law he was right here but he found out
[1:20:36] that that was dead
[1:20:42] itself think about the people Paul met
[1:20:45] on the other side that he had put to
[1:20:48] death how'd you get
[1:20:50] here they asked him how'd you get here
[1:20:55] thank God for
[1:20:56] Grace James 1:15 says then when lust has
[1:20:59] conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin
[1:21:04] when it's
[1:21:06] finished when it's
[1:21:08] finished bringing forth
[1:21:11] death listen we're all born in sin Paul
[1:21:14] even said we had our conversation in
[1:21:16] times past in the lust of the flesh amen
[1:21:19] Paul talks about lust a good bit he was
[1:21:22] a man he was a human we're all human
[1:21:25] and it's not just lusting after women
[1:21:27] it's lusting after a lot of things
[1:21:29] listen Paul lusted after Saul lusted
[1:21:33] after power he wanted power he had Gia
[1:21:37] and he had uh the other one there and he
[1:21:39] had all them he was right there with
[1:21:40] them Sanhedrin he was a he was a big dog
[1:21:43] he wanted to be the one that they put
[1:21:45] the whatever different colors around you
[1:21:47] know robe on him so he could be the
[1:21:49] righteous one or maybe the high PR you
[1:21:51] know what I'm sure he was working to be
[1:21:52] the high priest
[1:21:54] that's right but boy did God have a
[1:21:57] different work for that
[1:21:59] guy so when lust hath conceived now look
[1:22:02] there's four parts here when lust ha
[1:22:05] conceived it brings forth
[1:22:07] sin now and sin when it's
[1:22:11] finished bring it forth
[1:22:15] death Revelations 2:1 he that hath the
[1:22:18] ear let him hear what the spirit saith
[1:22:19] unto the churches he that overcometh
[1:22:21] shall not be hurt of the second death
[1:22:25] that's what God's talking
[1:22:26] about the second death Revelations 20:6
[1:22:31] blessed and holy is he that hath part in
[1:22:32] the First Resurrection on such the
[1:22:35] second death hath no
[1:22:39] power but they shall be Priests of God
[1:22:41] and of Christ and shall reign with him a
[1:22:43] thousand years Revelations
[1:22:45] 20:14 and death and hell were cast into
[1:22:48] the Lake of Fire this is the second
[1:22:50] death now those that are attached to
[1:22:51] that going in with it hello somebody
[1:22:54] that's the ones that are attached to
[1:22:55] that is going in with it and whosoever
[1:22:58] was not found written in the Book of
[1:23:00] Life was cast into the Lake of
[1:23:04] Fire so he's going to kill her with
[1:23:08] death death produces
[1:23:12] death death produces death God produces
[1:23:16] life after
[1:23:20] death not life after death in the grave
[1:23:22] like right now all right
[1:23:25] so let's look real quick and it'll be
[1:23:26] finish at 8:30 not too bad let's look at
[1:23:29] the sardian church age so remember that
[1:23:31] th tyan age they died the organizations
[1:23:35] died the people physically died they
[1:23:39] were physically killed by the Roman
[1:23:41] Catholic Church which everything they
[1:23:43] produced
[1:23:44] died except for Martin
[1:23:47] Luther but what did he do he stepped out
[1:23:50] of that he came out of her my
[1:23:53] people and he didn't partake of her sin
[1:23:56] now watch let's go to sardian church age
[1:23:58] just for a second then we'll then we'll
[1:24:00] close Revelations 3:1 to the angel of
[1:24:02] the church in Sardis right the sayith
[1:24:05] things saith that he that has the seven
[1:24:07] spirits of God and the Seven Stars I
[1:24:10] like how God just keeps reiterating that
[1:24:12] he's in control here he's got the Stars
[1:24:16] he's got the spirits all right he's got
[1:24:18] them I Know Thy works that thou Hast a
[1:24:21] name that thou livest and art dead
[1:24:26] Be watchful and strengthen the things
[1:24:27] which remain that are ready to die for I
[1:24:30] have not found thy works perfect before
[1:24:33] God like I said before there was a lot
[1:24:35] of things Martin Luther brought out of
[1:24:36] the Catholic church that wasn't
[1:24:39] true okay false baptism and all that but
[1:24:42] it wasn't time wasn't time this is the
[1:24:45] time remember therefore how thou Hast
[1:24:47] received and heard and hold fast and
[1:24:49] repent boy keeps repent repent if
[1:24:52] therefore Thou shalt not watch I will
[1:24:55] come to thee as a thief and thou shalt
[1:24:56] not know what hour I will come upon thee
[1:25:00] whatever the way the tree leans that's
[1:25:02] the way it's going to fall all right
[1:25:03] thou Hast a few names even in Sardis
[1:25:05] which have not defiled their garments
[1:25:08] and they shall walk with me in white for
[1:25:11] they are worthy he that overcometh the
[1:25:14] same shall be clothed in what white
[1:25:16] rment and I will not blot out his name
[1:25:18] out of the book of life but I will
[1:25:21] confess his name before my father and
[1:25:23] before his angels he that hath a near
[1:25:24] let him hear what the spirit says to the
[1:25:28] churches now we' come up to the age of
[1:25:31] Luther it's going to be the sardian
[1:25:33] church age from 1520 to 1750 we'll get
[1:25:36] into it Sunday about all the great
[1:25:38] things that come up the greatest thing
[1:25:40] was is like brother R said and I'll
[1:25:42] quote it where brother Ram said it
[1:25:43] wasn't that it wasn't about the only
[1:25:45] thing that that the commentator said
[1:25:47] about Luther was was that he could hold
[1:25:49] his head up against all the fanaticism
[1:25:51] that was going on around him if you'll
[1:25:52] watch that movie Luther the the the
[1:25:55] newer newer one you can see them they're
[1:25:57] burning down churches they're dragging
[1:25:58] priests out of the churches and and
[1:26:00] Luther walks up and he runs up here he
[1:26:02] says what are you doing you know what
[1:26:04] that guy said he said we're doing what
[1:26:06] you
[1:26:07] said they misinterpreted what he
[1:26:11] said and they were physically tearing
[1:26:13] the churches up and burning them Luther
[1:26:16] was burning them
[1:26:18] spiritually he wasn't burning them
[1:26:20] naturally he was burning them
[1:26:21] spiritually but we'll go to the
[1:26:23] mayonnaise but watch and Sardis was
[1:26:26] known for dying of wool we'll get into
[1:26:27] that there's a significance there carpet
[1:26:30] weaving gold coins were first Meed there
[1:26:33] the religion was and this we'll cover
[1:26:35] this and then we'll close mother was
[1:26:38] siel and son was
[1:26:42] Deus now that was mother and son worship
[1:26:46] at
[1:26:47] first all right everybody with me all
[1:26:50] right so
[1:26:52] now he was the son God she was the moon
[1:26:56] goddess he was the Lord of Heaven she
[1:26:59] was the Queen of
[1:27:01] Heaven now this is this is their Pagan
[1:27:03] this is what's going on in Sardis this
[1:27:06] is not what's going on with the bride
[1:27:07] this is what's going on in Sardis is
[1:27:09] everybody with
[1:27:11] me he the revealer of goodness and Truth
[1:27:14] she of gentleness and mercy he the
[1:27:17] mediator sheath the
[1:27:20] mediatrix he with the key that opens and
[1:27:23] shuts the Gate of the invisible world
[1:27:24] and she with an identical key doing
[1:27:28] likewise he as the judge of the Dead she
[1:27:31] is standing at his
[1:27:33] side he being killed raised and ascended
[1:27:36] into heaven she carried there
[1:27:38] bodily by the
[1:27:40] son this is this is Cel and
[1:27:44] deos now in Rome this same God has given
[1:27:47] the title of Our Lord this is Brother R
[1:27:48] I'm talking he is called the Son of God
[1:27:51] while she is called the mother of God
[1:27:55] going to tell you how Pagan really Pagan
[1:27:56] Rome is they took the world what the
[1:27:58] world was doing and they were they were
[1:28:01] they saw that the world was enamored
[1:28:03] with all these goddesses and gods and
[1:28:05] Thor and Zeus and remember brother B
[1:28:08] said they took Mercury down and put Paul
[1:28:09] up and they took this one down put the
[1:28:11] other one up well this is what's
[1:28:12] happening in here the Catholic Church
[1:28:13] looks at Sardis and looks at there going
[1:28:16] well they're worshiping a woman and a
[1:28:18] son but Watch What Happens now that is
[1:28:21] what we found back there in the other
[1:28:22] two ages where the mother and Son
[1:28:24] concept took on such tremendous
[1:28:27] proportions but now notice that even as
[1:28:30] it was back in Babylon that the worship
[1:28:32] of the son began to lose out in favor of
[1:28:35] the worship of the
[1:28:37] mother so she literally began to take
[1:28:39] the place of the
[1:28:41] son we see in this age that the Pagan
[1:28:44] worship of Sardis was the worship of the
[1:28:47] woman it was siel alone not sael and
[1:28:51] Doos de do the mother was literally
[1:28:55] taken the
[1:28:57] place that sound familiar any of you
[1:28:59] studied the Catholic church this is
[1:29:01] exactly what they do the mother mother
[1:29:03] has literally taken the place of the son
[1:29:06] endowed with the merits of godhead right
[1:29:09] all one needs to do is go over her
[1:29:11] various titles and recall the lovely
[1:29:13] attributes accorded Mary by the Roman
[1:29:16] Church to understand where the religion
[1:29:18] of this age came from the fact that this
[1:29:21] is the age of the first real break with
[1:29:23] paper Rome that actually flourished no
[1:29:25] doubt caused the Jezebel prophetess to
[1:29:27] consolidate and emphasize her doctrine
[1:29:30] of mariology or the do doctrine that
[1:29:32] marries God or a mother of God in
[1:29:35] decided opposition to the Protestants
[1:29:36] who denied her any part whatsoever and
[1:29:40] the Plan of Salvation now this is what
[1:29:41] Martin Luther stood up
[1:29:43] against he didn't he didn't GA that
[1:29:46] garbage of motherson worship he come out
[1:29:49] of
[1:29:51] that apart from her favor with God as
[1:29:53] the virgin chosen to Bear the baby as
[1:29:56] Luther crystallized the doctrine of
[1:29:59] justification by faith they held to The
[1:30:01] Works penants prayers and other
[1:30:03] unscriptural means and as the freed
[1:30:05] Christians glorified the Sun the Roman
[1:30:08] Catholic increased their deification of
[1:30:11] Mary until the 20th century saw in
[1:30:13] opposition to most high ranking Roman
[1:30:15] theolog theologians Pope P literally
[1:30:18] exalted Mary now we're talking about
[1:30:20] just several years ago I mean not
[1:30:21] several but 100 years ago Pope literally
[1:30:24] exalted Mary to glorification in a
[1:30:27] resurrected body now where did they get
[1:30:29] that
[1:30:30] from they got it from the from Sardis
[1:30:34] sail and the and the sun did away with
[1:30:37] the sun listen that's what did they do
[1:30:39] away with Jesus they hardly say anything
[1:30:41] about Jesus always Mary or Peter or one
[1:30:44] of the Saints they pray to this one pray
[1:30:46] to that one you don't have to pray to
[1:30:47] Jesus
[1:30:48] Anymore under their pretense that
[1:30:52] Doctrine is absolutely the the
[1:30:54] babylonius one of the son carrying the
[1:30:56] mother bodily into heaven look how
[1:30:59] subtle Satan
[1:31:01] is most of your Roman Catholic doctrines
[1:31:04] come from Pagan worship they know
[1:31:09] that but they keep the people so I'm
[1:31:12] sorry to say this so dumb down till they
[1:31:14] don't even read
[1:31:17] that thank God for a prophet that came
[1:31:20] and went back in the back part of God's
[1:31:22] mind the vision part of God's mind and
[1:31:25] brought us up into that Vision part
[1:31:27] where we can see we can see the
[1:31:29] opposition and see what the opposition's
[1:31:31] got now the combat Beast or the living
[1:31:34] creature was a man so now we have the
[1:31:36] man anointing which is a smart anointing
[1:31:39] it lasted from 1520 to
[1:31:42] 1750 and many many things according to
[1:31:46] um uh history was printing presses and a
[1:31:48] lot of different things were created
[1:31:50] during that time that we it's a
[1:31:52] precursor to what we use now but what
[1:31:55] God is doing God is bringing them out of
[1:31:57] the Dark Ages and he's bringing them
[1:31:58] something that he can give to the people
[1:32:01] and I hate to say Modern Age but God
[1:32:03] used the modern age does you not use it
[1:32:05] tonight you wrote in on
[1:32:08] it you wrote in on the Modern Age you
[1:32:12] got it on your phone on your on your
[1:32:14] wristwatch now that that you can uh This
[1:32:18] Modern Age Technology that we're talking
[1:32:20] about well it all started back there it
[1:32:23] all started with the printing presses so
[1:32:24] they could print the Bibles and we'll
[1:32:26] talk about that a little bit let's stand
[1:32:28] at our
[1:32:29] feet musicians come
[1:32:37] on thank God for
[1:32:39] truth thank God that we can look in
[1:32:42] scripture thank God that we can look in
[1:32:44] history I can even look I'm looking in
[1:32:46] history now and I'm seeing how God is
[1:32:48] weaving his way through all this junk
[1:32:50] that we call the earth and the world and
[1:32:53] religion and and then you know here you
[1:32:56] got leaders of the country that's doing
[1:32:57] things you know and and I don't know
[1:33:00] what the next election's going to be but
[1:33:01] who cares
[1:33:04] right who cares what's going on I really
[1:33:07] don't I just know one thing's for
[1:33:10] sure Israel is going to stay a
[1:33:13] nation and God's not going to deal with
[1:33:15] them until we get out of
[1:33:17] here so they're waiting it's just like a
[1:33:20] big you know how you we were well one of
[1:33:22] the planes we took off the other day
[1:33:24] Friday it never even it never even hit
[1:33:26] the brakes soon as it got on the runway

[1:33:30] place with a big airplane and you're
[1:33:31] sitting there and you feel those you
[1:33:34] feel those engines start whining and you
[1:33:36] feel that thing start surging forward
[1:33:37] what happens is the captain's got the
[1:33:39] brakes
[1:33:40] on and that thing's trying to move well
[1:33:43] the engines get to a certain RPM and
[1:33:45] then he releases the brake when he does
[1:33:46] what happens to your
