[0:00] come on all right remember all the ones
[0:03] that are not with us today because
[0:04] brother Bob you know obviously where he
[0:06] is
[0:08] and remember that family they're having
[0:10] the funerals tomorrow at 10 or 12 or
[0:13] something last bolon B
[0:18] Bon Wednesday night as soon as church
[0:20] was out what as soon as church was out
[0:23] WN just remember them in your prayer
[0:25] Monica's mother pass we had just
[0:29] Monica's mother died Wednesday
[0:31] night so um they're all down
[0:35] there at U we funeral will be tomorrow
[0:39] about I heard service Wednesday he said
[0:42] she wasn't doing well well they sent a
[0:44] text just as soon as a service was
[0:51] over she had just passed doing all she
[0:54] says she can feel the strength that
[0:57] she's drawing from prayers of you know
[0:59] believer yeah just pray for the
[1:02] family they've got some decisions they
[1:04] got to make about finances I don't know
[1:05] if they had insurance and I don't know
[1:07] if they had burial insurance so let's
[1:09] just keep them in your prayers as far as
[1:12] that goes cuz it does cost money to do
[1:14] things nowadays so and let me make a
[1:16] suggestion if you don't have insurance
[1:18] life insurance at least get some it's
[1:21] very cheap not for me it's well if you
[1:25] had it before and you were paying it it
[1:27] would be
[1:28] cheap
[1:30] okay I'm not berating you at all but why
[1:33] in the world would you die and leave
[1:35] your kids and family to have to pay the
[1:37] Sheep it's called
[1:38] cremation still you got to pay but if
[1:41] you're sick for 6 months before you die
[1:43] no even if you are aadab you have to pay
[1:47] for transport of the yeah yeah and yeah
[1:51] cremation is $68,000 so what do you I
[1:54] mean it still cost at least that
[1:58] much where I
[2:01] check yeah but he's going to like not
[2:03] have any service with nothing like the
[2:06] bare minimum take you to the commission
[2:08] and that's it no a $10,000 life
[2:10] insurance policy is only about $20 a
[2:12] month I don't care if you're high risk
[2:13] so $10,000 at least get you married hey
[2:16] I want to know the name of that a what
[2:18] insurance I want yes that's not what
[2:22] I I really do I can't get it for that me
[2:25] too have you looked at Xander yes we
[2:28] looked at all of them all both yeah yall
[2:31] are
[2:33] older y'all are
[2:36] old it wish they would not I don't the
[2:39] reason this pops up is I don't cut this
[2:40] computer on except on Sundays I guess I
[2:43] need to start doing it at
[2:49] home okay all right now but listen just
[2:53] pray for the family and they've got some
[2:55] decisions to make about the about the
[2:58] U it still takes money to run the world
[3:02] whether we like it or
[3:03] not um we need to at least not be so you
[3:08] know brother brandham said I'm talking
[3:10] over
[3:13] here brother brandham said you know he
[3:16] said if you're going to get married he
[3:18] said and you know the Lord's coming
[3:20] tomorrow what'd he say do get married he
[3:22] said if you're planting potatoes and
[3:24] then you know the Lord's coming tomorrow
[3:26] plant potatoes I mean come on let's
[3:29] don't be ignorant
[3:32] at least have something in place where
[3:33] you're not a hardship cuz we all think
[3:35] we're going to take the body change but
[3:37] you know what that's a very low
[3:38] percentage let's just be honest so one
[3:41] out of Georgia huh one out of Georgia
[3:43] that's right one out of Georgia the rest
[3:45] of them very good insurance that's
[3:48] right what he said what he said you just
[3:51] got to believe you're the one he knows
[3:53] that that so he I'll be the one IJ yeah
[3:57] okay uh that's probably not not the
[4:00] criteria but you can believe that if you
[4:04] want let's just walk in the word and
[4:06] just remember one thing we're still
[4:08] human beings we still got Life to Live
[4:10] and we still got things we got to do
[4:12] so you all went through the day Ramy
[4:15] class you know what he says about stuff
[4:16] like that so y let's don't be a burden
[4:19] on people if we do have to yeah keep the
[4:22] bucket yeah so fourthly we're talking
[4:26] now on
[4:27] Temperance we started last
[4:30] Sunday really talking about Temperance
[4:33] and uh we got into some good if you
[4:36] weren't here last Sunday you need to
[4:38] listen to last Sundays cuz it was really
[4:40] really good how we got into uh life and
[4:44] that's what we were talking about
[4:45] because the Bible says in second Peter
[4:48] it says it talks about life and
[4:49] godliness So it's talking about your
[4:51] life and it's talking about being Godly
[4:52] in that life so that when we get up to
[4:56] Faith virtue knowledge when we get to
[4:59] temperance he says we come to Temperance
[5:01] now you've got faith first have to have
[5:02] that to begin with then you add virtue
[5:05] to your faith but watch what he says
[5:08] right here he says if it's the right
[5:10] kind of
[5:11] virtue it's got to be a born again Holy
[5:14] Ghost
[5:15] virtue then you add virtue to Faith if
[5:18] it's the right kind of virtue then you
[5:19] add knowledge if it's the right kind of
[5:21] knowledge now we're going to add
[5:22] Temperance Temperance doesn't mean stop
[5:24] it stop drinking alcohol here either no
[5:26] no Temperance doesn't mean alcoholic
[5:28] cure not in this case this is Bible
[5:31] Temperance Holy Spirit Temperance that's
[5:34] just one of the lust of the flesh but
[5:35] we're talking about Holy Spirit
[5:37] Temperance now the lust of the flesh is
[5:39] he's talking about drinking alcohol all
[5:42] right but we're talking about Holy
[5:44] Spirit Temperance that means how to
[5:45] control your tongue not be a tler how to
[5:48] control your temper now it's not whether
[5:51] we get Sister Barbara to control her
[5:53] temper that's our problem right where's
[5:58] that it's going to be she's oh she's
[6:02] she's got a little she's got a little
[6:03] extra baggage to carry so she she she
[6:05] can be laid a little bit
[6:07] s but
[6:11] um not fly off on every hand don't see
[6:15] what talk about he's not how to control
[6:17] your temper now look pay attention it
[6:21] didn't say how to get rid of your
[6:23] temper that's
[6:25] right brother brandham never said get r
[6:29] R of your temper you cannot get rid of
[6:33] your temper that's right you're a
[6:37] human
[6:39] exactly and and brother Claude we talked
[6:41] this morning but he called me the other
[6:43] day and he's always got these little
[6:44] tidbits you know I love brother Claude
[6:46] because he can sit and do my studying
[6:47] for
[6:49] me cuz he he he's retired so he sits at
[6:52] home and he just goes through the
[6:53] internet and looks things up you know
[6:55] and all that stuff and then he calls me
[6:56] and he'll email it to me or send it to
[6:58] me and I'll get to use it so he's he's
[7:01] my study partner but he's doing all the
[7:03] studying but him being retired then
[7:05] that's great he can do that he can take
[7:07] his time and and do that but he said
[7:10] that suffering brings
[7:15] happiness after you think about that
[7:18] everything in the Bible tells about
[7:22] suffering but after the
[7:26] suffering is the happiness if you didn't
[7:29] suffer at all what would you be happy
[7:32] about right you tell me what would you
[7:35] be happy about if you didn't suffer
[7:36] there's nothing to compare now when we
[7:38] say suffer we don't mean laying in
[7:39] agonizing in pain we talking about
[7:41] suffering for our
[7:42] children
[7:44] right job home husband
[7:49] wife that's
[7:51] suffering but suffering brings happiness
[7:54] and that's exactly the truth you can't
[7:56] have happiness without suffering how
[7:58] much more the suff suffering in this
[8:00] world the Bible says and knowing that
[8:04] the happiness is coming but we got to
[8:06] suffer what did the Bible say we must
[8:08] suffer to rain he went through all the
[8:10] scriptures where the Bible talks about
[8:12] suffering look at the ten command I mean
[8:14] look at the
[8:17] Beatitudes the Beatitudes is not
[8:20] something that uh it's an easy thing to
[8:23] do so neither is temper how to control
[8:27] your temper not fly off every time
[8:30] anybody speaks cross to
[8:32] you cuz see Jesus got angry there was a
[8:35] part of his fleshly anger that that took
[8:38] over when he drove those people out of
[8:40] the
[8:41] temple he drove them out brother randam
[8:44] said he stood and platted the rope and
[8:47] he in other words he thought of what he
[8:50] was going to do pre premeditate he
[8:52] premeditated it all right so realize one
[8:57] thing for sure as long as as we're in
[8:59] this thing you'll never eradicate or do
[9:01] away with
[9:04] temper it says control your
[9:07] temper we all get upset yes is that not
[9:11] temper we all get upset that's temper
[9:14] but it's what you do after the thing
[9:18] pops up is to whether you know that God
[9:21] has took that thing and to me it's God
[9:24] puts a ceiling on it a ceiling s a c e i
[9:28] l a ceiling puts a ceiling on it a
[9:31] filter you can go yeah you can only go
[9:33] so far when we were out in the world and
[9:36] did the things of the world when we
[9:37] flipped people off and cursed at them
[9:39] there was no our ceiling was not there
[9:42] we just said what was on our mind right
[9:45] but holy ghost temper Temperance puts a
[9:48] ceiling on
[9:50] it which means that you can go so far
[9:52] and then God starts checking you and
[9:54] saying
[9:56] hey remember he he I would say now if
[10:01] Jesus was
[10:02] here in a Corporal body I would ask him
[10:05] that when he was going through his trial
[10:07] of the Cross of the thorns and the
[10:11] beatings that something didn't come
[10:13] across him of a little bit of anger or a
[10:16] little bit of grief or a little bit of
[10:18] say he suffered didn't he he was a human
[10:21] mortal man right but something inside of
[10:25] him kept him under submission right
[10:28] that's right cuz he did portray the
[10:30] anger part that's right when he was
[10:32] alive he portray when he was not there
[10:34] at Pilot's Hall he still he portrayed
[10:36] the anger part when he drove those
[10:38] people out of the out of the temple but
[10:41] see when he come down to where see God
[10:43] took him on the mountain and adopted
[10:46] him said this is the person you got to
[10:48] be like then what happened at Calvary or
[10:51] the time up to Calvary it didn't do away
[10:54] with the human
[10:57] man it controlled it
[11:01] it controlled everything that he was he
[11:03] was so under control until and it wasn't
[11:06] that he was ever out of
[11:08] control but what about the man that was
[11:10] driving the people out of the temple
[11:12] well those same people were crucified
[11:13] him wouldn't you think if they was
[11:15] something
[11:17] different he grew in Grace and knowledge
[11:20] the Bible said so he grew and at Calvary
[11:24] he didn't get angry as far as he got
[11:26] angry in the temple
[11:30] but he said father forgive them for they
[11:33] know not what they're doing all right
[11:35] now why didn't he say that in the
[11:37] temple why all he had to do was say
[11:39] father forgive them they don't know what
[11:40] they're doing no he was a human mortal
[11:44] man but God was so much in that
[11:47] man that he took over what was going on
[11:50] in that human mortal man our spirit is
[11:54] not the our spirit is not the Holy
[11:56] Spirit that's right his Spirit was the
[11:58] Holy Spirit right but he still grew in
[12:00] Grace and knowledge the Bible said he
[12:02] did and being made
[12:04] perfect so when he went to mount
[12:06] Transfiguration he was being made
[12:08] perfect this is my beloved Son whom I
[12:10] please to dwell hear ye him well that's
[12:12] the Capstone that's the love that means
[12:14] that whatever Jesus went through that
[12:16] that human mortal man of Jesus was at a
[12:18] position that God could use him same way
[12:21] with brother brandom was he not going to
[12:22] kill those boys remember he would have
[12:26] murder been a
[12:27] murderer he was going to shoot those
[12:30] boys but then you come on later in life
[12:34] they persecuted him not physically but
[12:36] they persecuted him spiritually mentally
[12:38] they kicked him out of the church he had
[12:40] no friends well he didn't rile with him
[12:42] people but Paul said he said the the
[12:46] thing I loved about my dad was you
[12:48] couldn't tell who was his enemies and
[12:50] who was his friends they were all why he
[12:53] had come to a
[12:54] place just like we all have to come to
[12:57] to a place when we started in our
[12:58] journey
[12:59] we're still going to be angry we're
[13:00] still going to be upset we're still
[13:01] going to be doing things wrong but we
[13:03] should come to a place to where that
[13:05] ceiling
[13:08] is lower and
[13:11] lower everybody understand what I mean
[13:13] your Toleration level yes is down here
[13:17] not way up under she had her
[13:20] hand the way I'm seeing it now is um
[13:23] first of all the knowledge which comes
[13:25] below that Temperance the knowledge that
[13:28] you have
[13:29] you're not pushing what you know on
[13:31] people corre holding back you're
[13:34] tempering your desire for everybody to
[13:36] know right and I I
[13:40] think it says to train up a child in the
[13:43] way it should go so you're using a
[13:45] temperament if a child is Naughty or an
[13:49] enemy comes against you you have a
[13:52] spiritual right to control
[13:54] yourself you know that's the discernment
[13:56] and I think that yeah with the
[13:57] discernment
[13:59] that's that's why knowledge is before
[14:01] Temperance You' think you'd want to
[14:02] control your temper at the very
[14:04] beginning but but if you have knowledge
[14:07] to control that temper see that's where
[14:10] God comes in he gives you the knowledge
[14:13] that father forgive them they know not
[14:15] what they're do or like you said you
[14:17] know well this is child training or this
[14:19] is something we got to go through or
[14:20] this is you know God will show you
[14:22] through knowledge he'll show you what to
[14:24] do not a question I just remembered
[14:27] something brother Charlie said he said
[14:29] that after the constellation of angels
[14:32] um that when brother Randon would come
[14:34] down there supposedly to hunt that he
[14:36] didn't even want to kill animals he was
[14:39] so sure it was all into it was all to a
[14:42] place where God had took the man to to a
[14:45] place that uh that he was uh that he had
[14:48] trained brother bradam and it's not that
[14:51] he didn't hunt now he hunted after 1963
[14:53] and killed game because he killed all
[14:54] them game in Africa right before he died
[14:57] so it wasn't just exactly lie
[14:59] but you come to a place to where that
[15:00] that's not important anymore you know to
[15:04] me to me I used to have I us have a bad
[15:07] temper did I I mean I would it would be
[15:09] kind of quick and then go away I never I
[15:12] never held a grudge did I never I don't
[15:14] I just don't hold grudges if you say
[15:16] something to me and I get a little mad I
[15:17] don't hold a
[15:18] grudge it just don't bother me a bit I
[15:21] don't care I really don't it's not that
[15:23] you don't care it's that you can handle
[15:24] it
[15:25] better cuz I can handle it better than I
[15:27] used to could why don't we always I know
[15:30] controlling your temper but it's but
[15:33] like the quote there it talks about not
[15:35] being a tadler holding your tongue I
[15:37] know that's a part of your temp that's a
[15:38] part of your temper but we always talk
[15:40] about controlling your
[15:42] temper so explain that go back to the
[15:45] roof is it like why do you
[15:48] tattle I mean I don't you don't but why
[15:50] people tattle they're angry at somebody
[15:53] I mean do you really I do when I did
[15:55] when I told on people I told on people
[15:58] cuz they did something to me most of the
[15:59] time something why do we all run our is
[16:03] that because we have because we're mad
[16:05] mhm I mean way down deep inside you got
[16:09] something do you title on something you
[16:11] like do you gossip about something you
[16:13] like no you just talk about I don't
[16:15] gossip about deer hunting cuz I like
[16:16] deer hunting but you can gossip and it
[16:19] be the truth yes you can so but
[16:23] still I have a hard time but still it
[16:25] makes you angry though I mean if it
[16:26] makes you angry whether it's truth or
[16:27] not I mean of us have heard the truth
[16:29] and got
[16:30] angry raise your
[16:36] hand Truth
[16:38] Hurts truth hurts what's another word
[16:41] for temperance would it be wisdom well
[16:44] wisdom is back there at for I mean at at
[16:47] knowledge Temperance to Temperance to me
[16:50] is like sister Trudy said it's you
[16:53] temper your thoughts or you temper your
[16:55] tongue you bring it to the middle of the
[16:57] road that's correct temper means to
[16:59] bring something together we're going to
[17:01] look up the word Temperance not today we
[17:03] won't have time all almost 15 after but
[17:05] we're going to look up the word
[17:06] Temperance as in what the the world
[17:09] calls Temperance and then we're going to
[17:10] bring it in to Bible Temperance because
[17:13] brother Brown see you can go to
[17:14] Temperance which means don't drink
[17:17] alcohol that's
[17:19] tempering your what your
[17:23] desire now see there's another thing you
[17:25] go to desire to me Des desire goes
[17:28] through all that don't you desire to
[17:30] have virtue yes you desire to have
[17:33] knowledge you desire to have Temperance
[17:35] it's your desire desire goes all the way
[17:38] up through now to me that goes back to
[17:41] what I said you still have a choice
[17:44] being a fullblown Christian just a
[17:46] full-fledged Holy Ghost filled person
[17:48] you still got a choice right desire
[17:52] desire is a
[17:54] choice right I desire to have virtue so
[17:56] God I'm going to just lay here and until
[17:58] you give me virtue what was that brother
[18:00] Brown said the guy said said brother
[18:02] said brother said I said God I'm going
[18:04] to lay here until you find a bag of
[18:06] bones do you give me the Holy Ghost you
[18:08] know what that kind of Desire God has to
[18:11] meet that because it's a desire to to
[18:13] worship him and not other things what
[18:16] our problem is is that we get
[18:20] this let me word my words right that we
[18:23] get this thing in
[18:26] us that we've got a and what does most
[18:28] of the time what does tling do what does
[18:30] what does tail bearing do it hurts
[18:32] someone else's
[18:34] feeling right not so much as hurts yours
[18:38] your tattle tailing and your jack
[18:40] drawing is hurting somebody
[18:43] else so they got to have Temperance
[18:46] you're trying their patience faith and
[18:49] all that stuff you're trying them when
[18:51] you when you title on or tell something
[18:53] that true or not
[18:56] true true or not
[18:58] mhm you're you're taking somebody up to
[19:02] another level because what's the first
[19:03] thing you do if you hear about it and
[19:05] even if it's
[19:07] true it's like Daddy you know he says
[19:09] don't discuss don't discuss Doctrine
[19:12] that's not conducive to this church in
[19:14] between yourself bring it to brother
[19:16] Dale well now it's going to get his
[19:19] righteous indignation up when he what
[19:21] hears you tling to the next person and
[19:23] the next person to the next and then he
[19:25] hears it 14th person h not first person
[19:30] sorry it's going to make you it's going
[19:32] to make your
[19:34] Temperance get tried right cuz he tells
[19:38] you what to do just like us as adults
[19:40] when our kids do everything we tell them
[19:42] to do which is 1% of the whole entire
[19:45] time they live maybe we're happy half a
[19:50] percent okay we give them a half a
[19:53] percent but the other 99 what does it do
[19:56] it tries our Temperance yes MH or hurts
[19:59] feelings same way with God you don't
[20:02] think God's Got
[20:04] Feelings brother brandham said the Holy
[20:06] Ghost was what
[20:09] timid now that's
[20:11] feelings you hurt the Holy Ghost
[20:13] feelings he's going to not come out of
[20:15] you and you become a sinner but he's
[20:17] going to what withdraw himself go out on
[20:19] the limb Prophet said and sit there and
[20:22] wait on you to call him by it because
[20:23] he's a gentleman he's very timid now
[20:25] being
[20:26] timid is a
[20:30] emotion well we just read God hates
[20:36] this he
[20:37] despises this love see so there's things
[20:41] in God that if he made us in His
[20:43] image then he's got the same emotions we
[20:46] do it's just a holy ghost emotion that
[20:48] never makes a mistake our emotions are
[20:50] human emotions that make a mistake and
[20:52] we got to go back and say God forgive me
[20:55] well he has no God to ask forgiveness to
[20:58] he's God and he said when he says it the
[20:59] first time it's always right cuz he's
[21:01] already got it thought out you and I are
[21:03] not that way but you what if we ever
[21:06] stop you know the old saying stop and
[21:08] count to 10 yeah what does that do that
[21:11] just don't mean just stop and count to
[21:12] 10 just CU you can count to 10 you have
[21:14] to wait till you're anger no what are
[21:16] you do what are they telling you to do
[21:17] hold on a minute pause think about it
[21:22] Temperance Temperance exactly what it is
[21:24] blind rage is not Temperance right
[21:27] Temperance is
[21:29] how to answer in kindness when wrath is
[21:31] spoke to
[21:33] you or find out somebody's been tiing
[21:36] you know I can see that can you see it
[21:37] better now where it's it's more of
[21:42] if let's say take all the gossip columns
[21:46] out they'd be hardly any news that's
[21:49] right would they they'd be hardly any
[21:51] news take the gossip columns out while
[21:54] they got uh just go to Walmart and stand
[21:56] in line and look at all them books
[21:59] them true story brother talking about
[22:00] true story and all that People magazine
[22:03] what is that tail Bears gossip and they
[22:07] just sell and sell and sell and sell and
[22:10] a lot of people get mad about it but
[22:12] here we are with God when we go upstairs
[22:15] in
[22:16] church our life then is an open
[22:19] book and if brother Dale hit something
[22:21] or brother Jewel hit something or
[22:22] somebody hit something and we get angry
[22:25] how many times have you seen it people
[22:26] get angry and leave the church
[22:29] now that's not Holy Ghost
[22:31] Temperance that's your ungodly temper
[22:34] where we'll read in just a minute where
[22:35] you can't control it that's right you
[22:38] might get a little
[22:39] upset but you'll say God that was the
[22:42] truth that's right and you know what
[22:45] then like he said the sorrow comes
[22:49] before
[22:50] happiness you get your hide burnt but
[22:53] you know what God's only going to chasen
[22:55] his children he's not going to chase
[22:57] Chas the devil's kids he's only going to
[22:59] chasen his own children so if you get
[23:01] chasen by God and you realize that it's
[23:04] for your own good and you say Thank You
[23:06] Lord then what more happiness is that
[23:09] God has come to you and said hey you
[23:11] need to work on this that's right and
[23:14] I've come and brought somebody to tell
[23:16] you that and I have made it aware in
[23:18] your spirit that you're supposed to
[23:19] change and you've acted right right now
[23:22] see that puts all that
[23:25] together I want to find out how they
[23:27] temp for steel because there's something
[23:31] there's something that they do to the
[23:32] metal to make it stronger yes and so
[23:36] how they burn it they heat it they heat
[23:42] it fiery
[23:44] TRS eat it and they beat it that's what
[23:46] the Bible says they beat it they do they
[23:49] beat it yep that's like the draw of the
[23:52] gold to get the shiny gold out you
[23:55] actually have to before they come up
[23:56] with the smelting process C of melting
[23:58] it the man would sit there and beat it
[24:01] with a hammer and what did it do it it
[24:03] throwed all the junk off of the off of
[24:06] the Nugget but when you got finished the
[24:09] Nugget cost more cuz it didn't have all
[24:11] the impurities in it so we're Tried by
[24:14] fire as the Bible says right coming out
[24:17] is pure gold all right so that's what I
[24:19] mean about a Temperance what more to see
[24:23] that
[24:24] that let me just give you an example and
[24:26] Terence doesn't mind me tell telling you
[24:29] he told me one time so I guess I can
[24:30] tell him because it's it's true he
[24:32] didn't like to wash black people's feet
[24:34] for a long
[24:36] time he was a little bit Prejudice he
[24:40] told me this had a hard time with it
[24:42] didn't do it avoided
[24:44] it and then God brought it to his
[24:46] attention one day through something I
[24:48] don't know what it was and that changed
[24:50] his whole attitude of that well you know
[24:52] what that's
[24:54] God telling his child you're acting
[24:58] up do
[25:01] better and he did see if he wasn't a
[25:05] child God can still come and tell you
[25:07] things this little thing that comes on
[25:09] in your in your psyche of your of
[25:11] yourself that says you shouldn't do that
[25:14] well now you can override that and going
[25:15] to do it
[25:16] again that's where brother Brown said
[25:18] the Holy Ghost then you don't get a lot
[25:20] of you don't get a life-changing
[25:21] experience when you come up to
[25:23] Temperance if you don't allow God to get
[25:25] rid of that thing for you or at least
[25:27] not get rid of it I'm sorry
[25:30] to cover it or to lessen it I mean we
[25:35] get angry every
[25:36] day yes don't we at something even our
[25:40] own
[25:42] self we get angry you know we lose our
[25:45] car keys or something well who do you
[25:46] get angry you get angry with
[25:51] yourself but you know
[25:53] what yes it's okay that well I didn't
[25:56] mean that for Joy actually minut it for
[25:58] Trudy but Jo you're in that category too
[26:01] if that's the case I stay angry but to
[26:03] me well yeah this is an epidemic but you
[26:06] can be too much the other way where
[26:08] you're not tempered that's right that's
[26:10] correct you've got to be tempered to the
[26:11] middle correct way what to be tempered
[26:14] to the middle is is put your car keys in
[26:17] one
[26:18] place Jo pray for me well hey we've got
[26:22] an epidemic here these two right here do
[26:24] the same thing Fredo call a 100 times
[26:27] out of 100 she'll say I L my I left my
[26:31] insulin I left my insulin where's my
[26:35] foot but but listen what we do with that
[26:39] now see if we become so callous to that
[26:42] and say well that doesn't matter well it
[26:45] does cuz it keeps you aggravated all the
[26:47] time you need to put forth an effort to
[26:50] put the things where they need to go
[26:52] everybody doesn't have a Danny fountain
[26:54] that hands me the keys and says here
[26:56] gece is going to need these you know I
[26:58] mean and it wasn't an hour after we got
[27:01] where we were
[27:03] going that Joy wasn't coming ask me she
[27:06] sent
[27:07] hope mama can't find her keys don't you
[27:09] have the extra step dad gave me gave you
[27:12] just one that was one time that's enough
[27:14] for
[27:15] me but it happens still does I'm
[27:19] beginning to feel like you're ignoring
[27:20] this black person here this is long time
[27:23] ago that she said this H I'm going to
[27:25] say what I got to say okay Joy said
[27:28] what's what's another word for
[27:29] temperance M another word for temperance
[27:32] is Faith virtue knowledge and just like
[27:35] together right just like when we get to
[27:38] patience another word for that is Faith
[27:40] virtue knowledge and Temperance good
[27:42] girl you do show up cuz I was thinking
[27:44] Temperance really is a virtue you do
[27:46] show up for some reason that's good
[27:49] sister my arm just broke also in their
[27:52] quote somewhere where brother Brandon he
[27:54] skips Temperance and he says faith
[27:57] virtue wisdom don't he do that yeah
[28:00] somewhere I mean you know wisdom you
[28:02] need that
[28:04] for you had to have all underneath cuz
[28:07] if you went up the ladder
[28:10] and down here you can't get up
[28:14] here yeah says it goes this way too
[28:19] right that is correct the I wish we
[28:22] could do it where the marks were going
[28:24] this way and you needed Faith all the
[28:25] way up and viral all the way up oh well
[28:29] but have you ever has anybody ever had a
[28:31] bad
[28:32] temper and realized that it was over the
[28:37] way you used to be that's the way I want
[28:39] to
[28:40] say see Dad did too remember when the
[28:43] guy SLA
[28:44] Daddy see that God's going to well see
[28:47] there's the suffering suffering brings
[28:49] happiness he had to suffer through a
[28:51] slap in the face but what did he do the
[28:54] next what did he do 5 minutes after
[28:57] afterwards God brought to
[29:00] his
[29:02] brain that's over with and he
[29:07] rejoiced because that was over with cuz
[29:09] you know that's a hard thing for some
[29:11] people yeah let somebody slap you you
[29:14] know what would you do right
[29:16] now you said well I know what I do well
[29:19] do
[29:20] you because you know what brother Brown
[29:22] said God will try these things to show
[29:25] you where you're at at brother said you
[29:28] can be anywhere you know anywhere with
[29:30] God at any time you will know that
[29:32] that's like Claude was saying the other
[29:33] day you know where you're at with God
[29:34] you know you still got a temper there
[29:36] somewhere that's right you know and you
[29:38] know what somewhere it's going to
[29:39] manifest in front of somebody as a
[29:41] witness and then you're going to say God
[29:43] I need to work on that I am not where I
[29:46] should be but let's read a few more of
[29:48] these before we just one more minute and
[29:51] these things excuse me boy a lot of us
[29:53] is going to fall off before we get
[29:54] started aren't we see then we wonder why
[29:56] God is not in this Church doing Miracles
[29:58] and things that they used to do yes sir
[30:00] you know why because the book of Acts
[30:05] had these virtues working in their life
[30:07] that's what we lost down through the
[30:09] church ages and brother Ram come not to
[30:12] just restore that he came to bring us
[30:15] back to the faith of the fathers but to
[30:17] take us on in a
[30:19] Rapture so if you want to say from 1947
[30:22] to 1963 which this was in 62 he comes to
[30:25] the Statue of a perfect man and and I'm
[30:28] I'm to the point to where I can say that
[30:30] from 47 to 63 he brought us back to what
[30:34] the book of Acts had but it was only in
[30:37] brother random at that
[30:39] time partially in other people all right
[30:42] partially and other people but brother
[30:44] random came to a
[30:46] Capstone to where God sealed these
[30:48] things in it took him from 47 to 63 God
[30:52] leading him through so don't think we're
[30:53] going to get it
[30:54] overnight it's going to be a work in
[30:56] progress a
[30:58] WIP but add these things add Temperance
[31:01] to it oh Temperance how to answer and
[31:02] kindness when wrath is spoken to you
[31:04] somebody says you bunch of ho RS down
[31:05] there don't jump out and roll up your
[31:07] sleeves cuz see he saw that in
[31:11] Pentecost they he said he have the um
[31:14] Temperance to fight a or temper to fight
[31:16] a buzz St right but speak in tongues and
[31:20] go to church and say you got hold don't
[31:22] jump up roll if your sleeve now see not
[31:24] that but talk with Godly love Temperance
[31:26] kindness
[31:27] is that the way you want to be
[31:28] congregation says amen when you're riled
[31:30] up R not back let him be your example
[31:34] when they said if thou be the Son of God
[31:35] turn these stones to bread he could have
[31:36] done it and showed he was God see you
[31:39] could do it show your God that's what
[31:40] daddy's talking about growing up into
[31:43] this place to where you we come to the
[31:45] third pole to where the third pole is
[31:46] going to be made manifest the third pole
[31:48] is not going to be made manifest in a
[31:51] baby cuz they don't know how to handle
[31:53] it it's like giving a car it's giving
[31:54] the keys to uh Jonas to a jet
[31:59] rocket it' be a disaster that's right
[32:03] but now train him up for 25 years let
[32:06] him be about 28 years old 26 years old
[32:09] then give him the keys he knows what to
[32:10] do with it he could he won't be a
[32:12] disaster with it well that's the same
[32:13] way with God that's right if he gives us
[32:15] the keys now to the kingdom like this he
[32:18] gives us the keys we could be we' be a
[32:20] disaster right we'd hurt feelings we'd
[32:23] do all these things wrong we would zap
[32:25] our boss out of existence that's right
[32:27] first thing we do my daughter-in-law or
[32:29] our spouse or a daughter-in-law see
[32:32] there so you got a Temperance problem
[32:33] right

[32:38] it when they call you Bells him but he
[32:41] said I'll forgive you for that keep
[32:44] going can you do
[32:46] that can you can you love your
[32:49] in-laws as much as you love your own
[32:55] I'm all right let's go work hard hard

[33:01] prayer prayer is where the answer comes
[33:06] from huh problem that's the problem
[33:09] she's working on that's
[33:11] correct we all got our own
[33:14] problems that's the problem fre working
[33:18] on wait you know when in culinary you
[33:21] cook in a cream sauce right you have to
[33:24] temper in the cream okay for the which
[33:27] means you stir it in but you have to do
[33:29] it slowly
