[4:25] so interesting amen okay Paul was so
[4:30] convinced that he was walking in the
[4:32] ways of God that God was dwelling him
[4:35] that he would tell people something like
[4:36] this
[4:37] which those things which he have both
[4:40] learned and received and heard and seen
[4:42] in me do can you tell the people that
[4:46] today what a question to ask my goodness
[4:51] because this is not the only scripture
[4:52] where he tells somebody that he also

[6:57] your thanks that I was looking at I
[7:02] was looking at Zak Sunday I think was

[7:23] thank God for for allowing us to be here
[7:25] another day man just keep brother
[7:28] brother wait in prayer as he travels and
[7:31] that the Lord would just you know he
[7:35] redeemed the time that he's there right
[7:37] man and that would uh you know be an
[7:41] effect to what the purpose of him being
[7:45] there you know and there's a lot of work
[7:47] to be done in so many places I think one
[7:50] of the things that needs to be done a
[7:51] lot is uh a lot of teaching needs to be
[7:55] done and and so pray for him that that
[7:59] he would just deal directly with the
[8:01] ministers pastors there I mean they
[8:04] could take those things they meant to
[8:05] their people like man praise God
[8:08] Amen you love the Lord tonight amen um
[8:12] you know thanks I I've just been you
[8:15] know I've just been been been struggling
[8:18] in the little in the last several days

[8:21] direction and and I just saying Lord you
[8:24] know where should i where should I go
[8:26] and what what should i what should I do
[8:28] and I was going a certain direction
[8:30] making notes a certain direction and
[8:32] then this morning brother Joe and me we
[8:34] were at a meeting this morning and and
[8:37] right there at that meeting and it's
[8:39] just unusual how God does things right
[8:41] there at that meeting where our boss was

[9:01] and and and and so the struggling that I
[9:04] was making week uh that I was having all
[9:06] week a man with the notes that I was
[9:08] creating God just gave me this and let
[9:11] me man just put it all together all in
[9:13] just a few hours and I just appreciate
[9:15] the Lord amen and so appreciate your

[9:19] for me man and I hope something said
[9:21] tonight that will help you amen cuz it
[9:23] certainly helped me praise God amen
[9:26] because uh you know this year I don't
[9:33] know about you but this year it started
[9:34] for us it started with a bang you know
[9:37] this this everything seems like whatever
[9:39] whatever is gonna go wrong is gonna go
[9:41] wrong you know we come back from
[9:43] Honduras and and and and and Satan's
[9:46] rubbing rubbing up Murphy you know they
[9:48] say Murphy's Law you know he's all over
[9:50] your cars and he's all check engine
[9:53] lights coming on and in the house is
[9:56] leaking and then everything whatever's
[9:58] gonna go wrong is gonna go wrong you
[10:00] know and there's just everything's just
[10:02] throwing it at you I don't know if you
[10:03] feel that way or not you know it's been
[10:06] a it's been like that for me I guess I'm
[10:08] the lucky one if you defeat oh if you're
[10:09] nothing I'm the lucky one just have all
[10:12] these things happen but but but you know
[10:15] God a man he's he's in control he's
[10:18] still on the throne you know and and and
[10:21] he hasn't forgotten and you know he
[10:24] knows exactly what you have need of a
[10:26] meant to to make you what you ought to
[10:29] be praise God amen and in John 14:27 he
[10:36] says he said to us he said peace I leave
[10:40] with you my peace I give unto you not as
[10:44] the world giveth a men but as I give to
[10:47] you you know and and and everyone is
[10:50] after peace the whole world is seeking
[10:52] peace and in the news you talk about in
[10:55] the news you hear about them calling for
[10:58] peace and cease fires and all these
[11:00] different things amen when in reality
[11:03] the peace that they're looking for is a
[11:05] temporary that they want a long lasting
[11:09] peace but
[11:10] means that they're going by with it it's
[11:12] only gonna lead to temporary peace
[11:14] there's no peace outside of the world
[11:17] there's no peace outside of God amen
[11:19] there's no peace outside of the Lord
[11:21] Jesus Christ amen because if you want to
[11:24] have real peace that is eternal peace
[11:26] when it's done through the Lord Jesus
[11:27] Christ a man we all want peace we all
[11:30] seek peace we all want to get along with
[11:34] one another a man but the world that
[11:39] this peace that because even Jesus says
[11:41] here peace I leave with you my peace I
[11:44] give unto you he said he says peace I
[11:46] leave with you peace I leave with you
[11:50] he's talking to his disciples I leave
[11:51] with you but look what he says my peace
[11:53] my peace I give unto you he's given us
[11:58] his peace amen when you've accepted his
[12:00] word amen when you've accepted him and
[12:03] his life he's given you his peace praise
[12:05] God
[12:06] not as the world giveth give I unto you
[12:10] amen praise God you know whatever kind
[12:13] of reminds me of it about he's not an
[12:15] Indian giver it doesn't give you
[12:17] something and then he takes it away hey
[12:19] man if the peace of God if peace Falls
[12:22] awhile falls off in your life it's your
[12:24] fault amen it's not God's fault amen
[12:27] it's your fault praise glory you know
[12:31] the one time there was a story you know
[12:33] we all have to battle with worrying and
[12:35] and turmoil you know in our lives
[12:38] constantly there was one time I heard I
[12:41] was reading this story one time that
[12:43] there was a death was coming through the
[12:47] town he was coming to a city and he was
[12:52] gonna kill a hundred people there was a
[12:55] man that went up to death and so I saw
[12:57] death and said death what are you doing
[13:00] he said I'm gonna go and take 100 people
[13:02] and the man said that's terrible the 100
[13:09] that's how it is that's how it's
[13:10] supposed to be that's what I'm here to
[13:12] do that's how I do things I'm taking 100
[13:15] people so the man you know he
[13:17] frantically he runs into into the city
[13:20] and start selling people and and and
[13:22] it's trust the warmth
[13:23] and so that evening he comes and yes he
[13:28] yes he has death did you take one huh he
[13:32] said he yes death actually took one
[13:35] thousand people so the man asked him and
[13:38] he said he said you said you were gonna
[13:41] take one hundred people why is it that
[13:43] one thousand are dead and he said I did
[13:46] fulfill my word death said I fulfilled
[13:48] my word I took one hundred people but
[13:50] where he took the rest worrying took the
[13:55] rest of the people you see it says when
[14:00] we get those when we get the news amen
[14:02] and in in bad news it comes into into
[14:05] your life and something not everything's
[14:07] not going right is worrying a man it
[14:10] might not be it might not be something
[14:12] uh it might be something small but to
[14:15] you it's something big and it's only big
[14:19] a man because it's how we make the
[14:20] things big amen it might be something
[14:23] that is insignificant to somebody else
[14:27] but to you it's something real amen
[14:29] but God amen it doesn't matter what it
[14:32] is it could be big it can be small God
[14:33] has given us a way Amen for for the
[14:36] peace that passes all understanding
[14:38] praise the Lord Jesus amen so Saints uh
[14:43] you know like I said this we got back
[14:46] from Honduras this this year and and
[14:49] Satan was right there on that on that uh
[14:53] what is that what is that part that they
[14:55] changed on my on my car the uh I forgot
[14:59] what it was now anyways he was right
[15:01] there just rubbing on that thing sitting
[15:04] on top of that that throttle body there
[15:07] you go just sitting on that throttle
[15:10] body just probably stumping it and
[15:11] dancing and everything you know and I
[15:14] know that he was probably stumping and
[15:16] sitting and staying on the under second
[15:19] floor upstairs but we got the leak up
[15:20] there now and he's there you know and
[15:23] yeah you know and with it with
[15:29] everything else gonna start doing our
[15:31] taxes and come to find out we owe so
[15:33] much money it's not even funny
[15:37] but you know what Saints there is no
[15:41] burden amen that God kit there's nothing
[15:43] that God that comes into your life that
[15:45] God doesn't allow amen
[15:47] that God doesn't it up because he knows
[15:49] that you can you can handle it amen
[15:52] he knows that you can head there's
[15:54] nothing that happens in your life just
[15:55] to happen oh my goodness what am I gonna
[15:58] do but God is in full control they meant
[16:03] God knows exactly what you need to make
[16:08] him more like him for you to keep
[16:10] growing in that they may be good Saints
[16:13] we say we all want it so easy we all
[16:15] wanted so so so soft and and so I wish
[16:19] crisis the Christian life was like that
[16:21] but you know it isn't amen
[16:25] you know it isn't and you know I'm just
[16:28] gonna be honest with you Saints well
[16:31] when we got back when we got back from
[16:34] Honduras the thought came to my mind you
[16:36] know thank you lord
[16:37] there's there's some money in the bank
[16:40] and thank you Lord that you know for you
[16:43] know the cars the cars are run have been
[16:45] running great Anke Lord you know that we
[16:49] had a prosperous trip in Honduras
[16:50] Nicaragua the people got the word thank
[16:53] you Lord and you know thank you Lord and
[16:56] it's coming almost like you start
[16:58] getting cocky and you better be careful
[17:02] because when you start feeling that way
[17:04] you know when you start feeling
[17:06] comfortable about things that's when God
[17:09] starts man I love okay you're not you're
[17:11] getting too comfortable you're getting
[17:13] too comfortable
[17:15] and that's when he allows Satan go ahead
[17:17] take care of that car go ahead and rub
[17:20] rub that pitchfork all over that all
[17:22] over that check engine light thing you
[17:26] know and and it's never failed to happen
[17:32] that way it always does and whenever you
[17:34] have that thought in your mind
[17:35] thank you Lord about a week later you Oh
[17:39] God I really thank you that's the time
[17:43] when you really need to thank you
[17:45] amen so that's how it's been but I you
[17:49] know I don't know I guess maybe this
[17:51] hasn't I'm the lucky one this year maybe
[17:55] it hasn't been like that with you but
[17:57] you pray for us amen praise God so st.
[18:01] the thing is is that Satan is not after
[18:05] your possessions he's not after he was
[18:08] not after my car he's not after your car
[18:10] he's not after your house you know Satan
[18:13] doesn't Drive so why is he gonna worry
[18:16] about your car amen
[18:17] but while he's really worried about he's
[18:20] what he's really after he's after that
[18:22] piece he's after your piece and the
[18:26] peace of God he's after a mint because
[18:29] let me tell you saints if he could take
[18:30] the peace of God away from you and
[18:32] you're not settled in your heart with
[18:35] God the way you need to be then that's
[18:37] going to lead amen to you for you to get
[18:40] anxious for you to get fearful for you
[18:44] to get worried and for you to and and
[18:47] and because you're you're allowing all
[18:49] that to start taking place in your life
[18:50] and you're going away further away from
[18:53] the Word of God the Word of God and no
[18:55] and and then finally the Word of God has
[18:57] no more effect on you and then you're
[18:59] backslidden because that's the whole
[19:03] plan that Satan wants you do it and it
[19:06] all started with a throttle body it all
[19:09] started with a leaking your and your
[19:11] roof it all started because you owe the
[19:14] IRS money he's not after those things
[19:18] those are just symptoms he's after that
[19:21] peace amen praise the Lord and so you
[19:27] know he's up to me he's I call Satan II
[19:32] you know he's like a spiritual terrorist
[19:35] you know what a terrorist is right yeah
[19:39] the terrorist is a person who uses
[19:43] unlawful violence and intimidation
[19:46] especially against civilians in the
[19:49] pursuit of political aims yeah you see
[19:53] but saying is not after political aims
[19:55] obviously he the political world he's
[19:57] got it under control
[19:58] see but he's not after that any man who
[20:03] used whatever means whatever terrorist
[20:06] activity amen
[20:08] to try to take the whole the the bigger
[20:11] picture away because when a terrorist
[20:14] strikes Saints you got to remember this
[20:15] when the terrorist attacks and if you
[20:18] can seem terrorists in the news and
[20:20] stuff like that and he's caused damage
[20:22] and he's killed a lot of people he
[20:24] wasn't really to try to to make to do
[20:29] all that hurt to the people that died in
[20:32] that in that incident you know let's say
[20:34] terrorists attacked the bus he wasn't
[20:36] trying to kill the the people in the bus
[20:38] I mean obviously but what he really
[20:40] wants is the people that he didn't kill
[20:43] well he really wants are the ones that
[20:46] view that viewed that to try to bring
[20:49] that fear on the ones that weren't in
[20:51] there you see what I'm saying because
[20:54] what that what that does to you he's
[20:57] like home he's trying to say my you
[21:01] could be next you could be next and so
[21:06] what he's doing he's trying to plant
[21:08] that say he wasn't after the people in
[21:09] the bus that was just that was just a
[21:12] symptom in order for him to get the
[21:14] whole overall picture amen he's after
[21:17] you he's after your peace amen and then
[21:22] and he'll threaten you and he'll send
[21:24] all kinds of threats to you amen to try
[21:28] to rob you from your peace but you have
[21:30] to recognize saints that he's a bluff
[21:32] everything every time he opens his mouth
[21:34] he's nothing but a bluff he's just
[21:36] bluffing
[21:37] he can't do nothing yeah you know he
[21:41] can't do anything with you before you
[21:43] came to when you came to the Lord Jesus
[21:46] because you put all your sins under the
[21:48] blood a man the word convinced you a man
[21:51] and he can't do nothing with you so now
[21:54] what he's gonna try to do he's gonna try
[21:55] to rob you from from from the peace of
[21:57] God tried to rob you from your future a
[21:59] man with a future with God praise the
[22:04] Lord so that's what Satan tries to do
[22:08] he's that's what it is a spiritual
[22:10] terrorist try to rob you from your piece
[22:13] you know Saints when 9/11 took place you
[22:17] know it wasn't really as damaging and
[22:20] nsns chaotic in US and as sad as this as
[22:23] that as that was but it was really the
[22:27] after-effects that took place after that

[29:12] in some way somehow things were just
[29:15] gonna get worked out at the end that's
[29:17] not how it works you need God in your
[29:19] life now amen
[29:21] you need Christ in your life in your
[29:23] heart now you need to serve Him amen
[29:25] praise God cuz others are watching you
[29:30] others are watching you and the life
[29:33] that you portray a man before others
[29:35] those that have children and the life
[29:37] that I portray before my children the
[29:39] way I go is the way by the way my
[29:41] children are gonna go if you're lazy and
[29:45] if you don't come to the house of God
[29:47] and you don't and you don't meditate on
[29:49] the word and you any
[29:51] besides the word don't don't get upset
[29:55] when your children go that direction
[29:58] don't get upset
[29:59] you're the one that did it you're the
[30:01] one that caused it so Paul here's is
[30:11] saying amen live peaceably with all men
[30:14] and Philippians chapter 4 verse 2 it
[30:16] says I beseech you Dias and beseech
[30:20] cinta k that they be of the same mind in
[30:25] the Lord
[30:25] now here Paul he's talking about before
[30:27] he starts talking about the peace of God
[30:29] he's already talking about Amen he asks
[30:32] you you Diaz in cinta ki to be at peace
[30:35] with one another or in one Accord Amen
[30:38] you hold how wonderful it is for
[30:40] brethren to dwell together in unity they
[30:42] meant it's marvelous it's wonderful
[30:45] praise God and you know what happened in
[30:49] the upper room God came down on the
[30:51] scene Amen when they were all in one
[30:53] Accord Amen
[30:55] not one one here one trying to go this
[30:58] way one trying to pull this way one Amen
[31:01] they were all they had all things in
[31:03] common the Bible says amen in Romans
[31:07] chapter 12 verse 18 it says if it be
[31:09] possible as much as lieth in you live
[31:13] peaceably with all man but if you don't
[31:19] have the peace of God in you then you're
[31:21] not gonna be able to live peace with all
[31:22] man if the peace of God is not dwelling
[31:25] in you because remember Jesus said my
[31:27] peace I give to you
[31:29] it's his peace amen he is peace
[31:32] he has true peace and if that peace is
[31:34] not raining in you if it doesn't dwell
[31:36] in you amen
[31:37] you're not gonna be able to live
[31:38] peaceably with all man you're gonna
[31:42] struggle you'll struggle raise god I
[31:50] think let's continue reading here and in
[31:53] Philippians 4:4 rejoice in the Lord
[31:56] always rejoice in the Lord always and
[31:58] again I say rejoice you see how you see
[32:01] how Paul right there he says it twice
[32:04] so rejoice in the Lord always and again
[32:07] I say rejoice amen oh I owe the IRS five
[32:15] thousand dollars there's no way I can
[32:18] rejoice no that's the time for you to
[32:25] rejoice that's the time to show Satan
[32:28] Satan this is all for my good
[32:32] amen Satan God knows what he's doing
[32:36] and God knows that if I need to pay
[32:38] these five thousand dollars to the IRS
[32:40] it's because he's work he's doing still
[32:43] working on me he's not done with me God
[32:46] knows if I if I if his Satan was rubbing
[32:49] my throttle-body amen he knows that that
[32:52] was for my good hey man
[32:55] praise God you imagine what what job was
[32:58] saying what he was going through hey man
[33:00] I mean and he was a dedicated man of God
[33:05] he was dedicated not only that he was
[33:09] such a testimony probably to because of
[33:11] what the scripture tells us a testimony
[33:13] to his family a testimony to his
[33:15] children that he would even offer
[33:17] sacrifices amen in case they sinned for
[33:21] them if they're not doing it I'll do it
[33:24] so they can see I'm doing it so they can
[33:26] go do it amen and because he was so
[33:32] dedicated and then all of a sudden his
[33:36] children gone his house starts falling
[33:40] apart sickness starts coming on his body
[33:44] he comes he has to come to a point
[33:47] because remember Satan can't touch you
[33:50] unless he gets he gets permission from
[33:51] God he can't touch you unless God has
[33:55] given okay go ahead you could touch
[33:57] brother Boyd in this area in fact I
[34:03] didn't say what you could touch him in
[34:08] this hour God this is God speaking you
[34:09] can touch him in this area because I
[34:10] know he's gonna overcome
[34:13] he's gonna show you a thing or two say
[34:15] Amen praise the Lord but also in the
[34:19] process not only is he saying is showing
[34:21] Satan that he's wrong he's also showing
[34:24] you something that you didn't even know
[34:25] about yourself and about God you see
[34:29] sometimes Saints we think that the
[34:30] issues that we go through the problems
[34:32] and the trials that happen in our lives
[34:33] oh it's just for that issue no God is
[34:38] molding something in you God is trying
[34:40] to show each and every one of us
[34:42] something amen that we didn't know about
[34:43] ourselves and it's most certainly we
[34:45] didn't know about God praise God see God
[34:48] is so detailed like that he knows us
[34:51] better than you know yourself you think
[34:53] you got it all down you think you think
[34:55] you got 1977 all all laid out and and
[34:59] you got everything laid out and it's all
[35:02] just head knowledge to you if Christ is
[35:07] not dwelling in your life amen
[35:09] what is all that matter if you're not
[35:12] serving God if you don't go pray if you
[35:16] don't go meditate on the word I
[35:19] appreciate what the brother Dale brought
[35:22] out but did that help you go and seek
[35:25] the Lord Sunday night or did you go home
[35:29] and just sit down in front of the TV
[35:39] you know Saints we're living in a late
[35:42] hour it's a late hour did it make you
[35:47] gather your family and say children we
[35:51] need to draw closer to God children that
[35:54] hour is late we need to pray more we
[35:57] need to seek God more or did you just
[36:01] put another Netflix movie for the
[36:03] children to watch so you can watch with
[36:05] them yeah my Saints rejoice in the Lord
[36:10] always and again I say rejoice
[36:12] amen and that word that word rejoices
[36:15] says it says here in it says to rejoice
[36:19] be glad to rejoice exceedingly amen
[36:23] praise God God wants us to be rejoiceful
[36:26] I mean the things that we think that
[36:30] might be harming us in turn God is
[36:32] really trying to take us to a certain
[36:34] point in our life amen
[36:37] be careful for nothing Paul says in and
[36:40] verse 6 be careful for nothing now that
[36:42] word careful is not that you be careful
[36:46] you know be careful but in other words
[36:48] don't be anxious about anything right
[36:51] Amen now he says don't be anxious or
[36:55] worried about anything because sayings
[37:02] when you're worried about anything no
[37:04] matter what it is it could be little it
[37:07] could be big and you're worried to death
[37:10] about that thing amen you're putting
[37:12] that thing over the Word of God you're
[37:16] worrying amen your income you're in
[37:19] you're in direct disobedience to this
[37:21] verse right here yeah be careful for
[37:24] nothing in other words don't be anxious
[37:26] for nothing there's nothing so big and
[37:28] nothing so small that you have to be
[37:32] worried about praise God nothing that's
[37:39] why Paul said in another place there's
[37:41] not not death not height not not not you
[37:45] know the different things that he
[37:46] mentions nothing can separate us from
[37:48] the love of God which is in Christ Jesus
[37:52] Amen be careful for nothing but look
[37:55] what Paul says here mm-hmm amen
[38:01] says be careful for nothing but in
[38:04] everything in everything by prayer and
[38:08] supplication with Thanksgiving amen
[38:14] prayer in everything by prayer the
[38:22] solution to being anxious and worried it
[38:26] is is praying that's the solution that
[38:30] Paul was trying to give us oh no it
[38:34] can't be that easy it can't be that that
[38:37] that's simple but we try to make we're
[38:41] the ones who make the Christian life
[38:43] difficult God is trying to give us here
[38:46] a remedy for our worrying and for our
[38:50] and for our our life living without
[38:53] peace amen and we know Saints that we
[38:57] all need to pray right I mean that's
[39:01] just the basic thing of a Christian life
[39:03] prayer but do we do it I'm talking about
[39:08] praying I'm not talking about two or
[39:10] three minute prayers I'm talking about
[39:12] praying amen
[39:14] maybe because sometimes it seems have to
[39:19] happen in our life bad things have to
[39:21] happen in our life in order to get down
[39:23] on our prayers to get down on our knees
[39:24] otherwise it's just sit on the lazy boy
[39:33] life is easy when you're up on the
[39:36] mountain amen but it's down in the
[39:39] valley amen when things get hard but you
[39:44] know Saints before you get into the
[39:45] battle you should already be pray it up
[39:47] amen
[39:49] then you wouldn't be panicking and you
[39:50] wouldn't be wearing and you wouldn't be
[39:52] fearful and you wouldn't be all these
[39:53] things amen
[39:54] if you were prayed up you would already
[39:58] know the solution to your problem that's
[40:00] the solution be anxious for nothing
[40:04] problem comes in huh thank you Lord
[40:08] hallelujah but in everything by prayer
[40:13] and supplication now you know what
[40:16] supplication means means to humbly amen
[40:20] come before the Lord amen to humbly say
[40:27] Lord I'm here supplication draws you to
[40:30] your knees supplication amen gets you
[40:33] down to a place where you know how the
[40:36] Bible says that David pray when he was
[40:38] when he was when he when he had sinned
[40:40] before the Lord it was down before he
[40:43] was down on the floor you know I'm not
[40:45] saying that you have to do that but I'm
[40:47] saying your heart shows they man whether
[40:49] you're when you're whether you're really
[40:50] humble before God or not amen
[40:53] you're coming before a king praise God
[40:56] in supplication hallelujah praise God
[41:02] first John 5:14 it says here it says and
[41:06] this is the confidence that we have in
[41:08] him that if we ask anything according to
[41:10] his will he heareth us you see when you
[41:13] come to God you got to know this that he
[41:16] hears you amen and if we know verse 5 of
[41:21] 15 it says here and if we know that he
[41:24] hears us whatsoever we ask we know that
[41:28] we have the petitions that we desired of
[41:31] him well the word already says it so why
[41:35] are you so worried are you so anxious
[41:41] you couldn't change the the situation
[41:44] right there and then you can't change it
[41:47] now let him take care of it put it in
[41:51] his hands
[41:52] amen he said that he said in this in
[41:54] confidence that we have in him that if
[41:56] we ask anything there's nothing too
[41:59] great for God according to his will he
[42:00] hears us hallelujah amen so that's so
[42:06] you we have prayer amen when Satan comes
[42:10] in with his spiritual terrorism
[42:13] amen we have prayer to go to use we have
[42:17] supplication to use and then the other
[42:20] thing that it said there what did it say
[42:22] there with Thanksgiving yeah you you add
[42:32] those three elements together you know
[42:33] when you add certain ingredients
[42:35] together when you're trying to make
[42:37] German chocolate cake there's got to be
[42:41] certain ingredients to be added together
[42:42] in order for there to really be a German
[42:44] chocolate cake amen
[42:47] if you only just add supplication you
[42:50] might not get the whole thing to hope
[42:52] the benefit of the whole the whole
[42:53] recipe you see if you just add
[42:56] Thanksgiving you see but amen if you add
[43:01] prayer and supplication with
[43:03] Thanksgiving let your requests be made
[43:06] known unto God then right amen praise
[43:10] God amen so when the enemy starts
[43:15] attacking you a man just start counting
[43:16] your blessings say Lord thank you for
[43:20] that boss that you gave me at work and
[43:22] what gets on my nerves I thank you lord
[43:27] thank you Lord for that person that
[43:29] church that just him or her get on my
[43:32] nerves
[43:32] thank you Lord thank you Lord because I
[43:36] owe the RS $5,000 thank you Lord because
[43:40] you're you're allowed Satan to run
[43:42] around on my throttle body heat on my
[43:44] car yeah you think it's funny it it
[43:52] sounds silly but that's why he wants you
[43:54] to do it
[43:57] thankfulness but we don't we don't want
[44:00] to do that we don't thank him for the
[44:02] bad things that happen in our lives
[44:04] that sounds silly but that's what he's
[44:08] had to do be careful for nothing but in
[44:12] everything not in some things the
[44:16] throttle body is that one one of those
[44:18] things right the IRS is one of those
[44:21] things right
[44:22] amen but in everything by prayer and
[44:26] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[44:27] requests be made known to God that's
[44:29] when you can go ahead and let your
[44:30] requests be made known to God amen
[44:34] because now you're entering into what
[44:36] he's asking you to do hallelujah I like
[44:42] I like that when Jesus a man he when he
[44:46] took the FOB was it the two fish in the
[44:48] five loaves it was something little
[44:51] there's not much but when he raised them
[44:55] and he thanked the Lord for that it
[44:57] multiplied into and fed everybody man
[45:00] right it can be a little thing in your
[45:02] life I just say Lord this is all you've
[45:05] given me
[45:05] I thank you Lord and you watch him
[45:07] multiply that in your life amen
[45:09] you watch him take care of that need in
[45:12] your life amen
[45:13] you watch him amen go in there and and
[45:15] do exactly what he promised he said that
[45:18] he'd do in his word whatever is that
[45:20] that you're going through just lift it
[45:24] up to God he'll take care of the rest
[45:27] that's what Jesus did with the little
[45:29] five loaves and the two fish thank you
[45:31] Lord and a miracle took place hallelujah
[45:37] amen now watch what verse 7 says after
[45:41] you've done after you've done prayer
[45:44] thanks we got to pray more we really do
[45:48] have to pray that's one thing that God

[47:24] this issue you might be going through a
[47:26] problem I see a tumor on my leg but the
[47:30] peace of God that passes all
[47:31] understanding I see this problem in my

[47:38] the peace of God that passes all
[47:39] understanding I understand that that
[47:42] issue is there I understand that there
[47:44] is a problem I see it but those are all
[47:48] lying vanities and I will not believe
[47:50] one of them a man that passes all human
[47:52] reasoning all human understanding a man
[47:56] that's the peace of God Saints that's
[48:00] the peace that he wants you to walk with
[48:02] that he wants you to run with amen his
[48:05] peace that passeth all understanding
[48:12] Amen because that's not your peace
[48:16] Saints better remember the when the when
[48:22] the disciples were in the boat with with
[48:23] Jesus and you know the professional
[48:29] fishermen that were that the disciples
[48:31] were there what wouldn't you know in the
[48:35] boat and you know and they when you're a
[48:38] professional at something you know
[48:39] you're your professional you know you
[48:42] know what you're doing
[48:44] but they're here comes they come into
[48:47] this store into
[48:49] bow and all of a sudden this storm
[48:50] breaks out and the disciples are worried
[48:55] and scared to death because their
[48:57] professionalism couldn't do anything
[48:58] about that that storm was so severe that
[49:03] storm was so harsh that that the Bible
[49:07] says the waters were was coming into
[49:09] boat and they filled the boat about the
[49:11] Bible says and you know what the Bible
[49:14] says that Jesus was in the back of the
[49:16] boat with a pillow is that the Bible
[49:21] says that he had a pillow if you if you
[49:23] read the scripture with a pillow
[49:25] sleeping thermals all around them chaos
[49:33] all around them let me know if they were
[49:37] going to live or die but Jesus is in the
[49:40] back of the boat sleeping I don't know
[49:43] of any other a better example of the
[49:46] peace of God than that right there
[49:49] that's the peace of God right there that
[49:52] you could be gone no matter what's going
[49:54] on in your life and that doesn't make
[49:57] you losing you to sleep at night that
[50:01] doesn't make you lose any sleep
[50:02] amen suppose we catch it up catch up
[50:06] here at church but amen
[50:14] but that doesn't make you a man that's
[50:17] well that's when when you hear good meat
[50:19] when you hear bad news come into your
[50:21] life and you still have a good attitude
[50:23] about it
[50:23] that's the peace of God right there man
[50:26] that's the peace of God oh you know my
[50:29] son did this and in my mouth my daughter
[50:32] did this and they and my my wife this
[50:34] happened to my wife and and this is
[50:36] taking place and no oh and I went to the
[50:39] doctor and they said I had this and when
[50:45] you say well thank you lord
[50:47] thank you Lord because it's already done
[50:50] it's already done healing you've already
[50:53] taken care of that forgiveness you've
[50:56] already taken care of that
[50:57] amen financial issues Lord you said
[51:00] you'd already take care of that no
[51:03] matter what it is the peace of God if it
[51:07] dwells in you doesn't look at none of
[51:10] those things it looks at the word he
[51:12] looks at the promise Amen so that that
[51:21] scene right there Saints it's just one
[51:23] of the best scenes out I know of about
[51:25] the peace of God Jesus sleeping on a
[51:28] boat and then you know what he gets up
[51:30] and he says peace be still
[51:35] and he rebukes the disciples and says
[51:39] why are you so fearful
[51:41] I'm sure the disciples are thinking my
[51:44] goodness our boat is filled with water
[51:46] and I'm sure Jesus is walking all in
[51:48] that water too to get on top Shh
[51:54] peace be still
[52:00] all symptoms all around you but you'd
[52:03] still say peace be still you know why
[52:06] because the peace of God was audible
[52:07] drilling in him a man he is the peace
[52:09] praise God hallelujah amen and and in
[52:15] continuing here in verse 7 Amen it says
[52:18] and the peace of God which passeth all
[52:20] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[52:25] minds through Christ Jesus
[52:27] not that it wit may may keep you but at
[52:32] that it shall you shall keep your hearts
[52:36] and minds through Christ Jesus amen
[52:40] you know that the the issue that you may
[52:43] be going through your life in your life
[52:44] he meant you say I'm going crazy going
[52:48] through this I'm about to go crazy
[52:50] but a man if you just practice this a
[52:53] man
[52:54] go to God in prayer take it to God in
[52:56] prayer take it to him in supplication
[52:59] thank God for that situation thank him
[53:04] amen that sounds so weird and radical
[53:07] but just do it and you'll realize that
[53:11] he's gonna keep your heart and mind
[53:14] through Christ Jesus in other words he's
[53:19] keeping giving you the peace of God
[53:22] through his peace he is our peace amen
[53:29] and I like what it says here amen what
[53:31] that word keep means he said it means to
[53:37] keep with a garrison to guard protect by
[53:42] a military guard either to prevent
[53:45] hostile invasion or to keep the
[53:47] inhabitants of a besieged city from
[53:49] flight Amen so when God is dwelling in
[53:53] you Amen through the new birth amen
[53:56] you're that's a garrison right there
[53:59] amen
[53:59] God has taken complete abode amen and
[54:03] there's nothing that you have to be
[54:05] fearful about not only that his whole
[54:08] army is around you with angels and
[54:10] everything praise God he's taking a
[54:17] permanent military installation in you
[54:22] why fear why worry oh this is this took
[54:30] place this took place I don't know what
[54:32] to do but they're all certain that peace
[54:36] of God just cars amen
[54:38] it says this is the way to do it man
[54:42] this is the way to be praise God because
[54:47] Saints going back to this this the
[54:50] spiritual terrorism hmm sometimes Satan
[54:54] what he wants you to do it man because
[54:56] anxiety and fear and none of these
[54:59] things can work on their own they need
[55:04] to have private meetings with you
[55:06] in order for those things to work they
[55:10] need to put you in a corner somewhere in
[55:15] anxiety talking to you and and fear
[55:17] talking to you and complexes and all
[55:20] kinds of things talking to you and and
[55:23] say yeah you see that you see what and
[55:27] you said yeah yeah you're right you're
[55:30] right yeah and just conversating back
[55:32] and forth back and forth back and forth
[55:34] and finally you're in that position you
[55:37] can't even get out of that it's so
[55:40] engrained in your mind you can't even
[55:42] get out of it because there's no peace
[55:45] in your heart you have not let the peace
[55:48] of God work in your life because you
[55:50] don't pray you don't go to God in prayer
[55:52] you don't you don't meditate on his word
[55:55] you're just taking this thing in a
[55:57] rollercoaster ride I mean in a car in a
[56:01] on a cruise control ride amen if we just
[56:07] let amen Satan comes in with those
[56:10] things amen you have you have something
[56:12] to fighting him against yeah amen Tom
[56:16] that's what Jesus did I said all the way
[56:20] here he overcame his those temptations
[56:22] amen he just put the word back to Satan
[56:26] speak the word back to him oh but that's
[56:31] not him that's not important you know in
[56:33] this situation this situation needs more
[56:35] than that what situation those needs
[56:38] needs more than the Word of God there's
[56:40] nothing nothing that the Word of God
[56:42] cannot handle they men nothing that the
[56:45] Word of God cannot not not not solve for
[56:47] you amen praise God so when you've got
[56:52] that new birth in your life amen
[56:54] God is completely amen he's he's a
[56:58] permanent military installation there's
[57:00] nothing that Satan can do hallelujah mmm
[57:04] praise the Lord Saints remember that
[57:07] story about Elijah when he prays for his
[57:10] servants eyes to be opened
[57:16] yeah if you all know this that if you
[57:19] remember the story Elijah
[57:21] found out that the that I forgot the
[57:23] other the other kingdom the other the
[57:28] other people they had a secret place
[57:32] that they had found that they were gonna
[57:33] ambush the Israelite army at that at
[57:36] that spot and nobody knew anything about
[57:39] it
[57:39] except for those people for that army in
[57:41] the king and Elisha found out about it I
[57:48] believe God told him so he went to the
[57:52] he went to the to the king of Israel and
[57:54] the king and told the king of Israel
[57:56] that listen they got an ambush waiting
[57:59] for you do not go to this certain spot
[58:01] and so the king of Israel thanked Elisha
[58:04] and they didn't do it well word comes to
[58:07] the king of that of those people or not
[58:10] the people forget that city or that or
[58:13] that country escapes my mind right now
[58:15] they went to the day who is it is there
[58:18] a spy who is it that told Elijah where
[58:22] is the spot that we were going to to
[58:24] handle the Israelite army and you know
[58:29] the Israelite that army was pretty smart
[58:31] because they said well there's a man
[58:33] under there that God tells him all kinds
[58:35] of things he's not even into our Israel
[58:40] army but God talks with him and it was
[58:43] it was Elijah that told he'll I shall
[58:45] Dothan well instead of that King you
[58:50] know being impressed and they're like
[58:52] wow I want to meet that God no he says
[58:54] where is that city of Dothan let's go
[58:56] over there and we're gonna surround it
[58:58] we're gonna show you like sure thing or
[59:00] two hey spoiled our plan so they go the
[59:05] this army goes and and and with horses
[59:08] and and and soldiers and then they start
[59:11] surrounding the city and Elijah Elisha
[59:15] is there with his servant and the
[59:16] servant his servant all of a sudden
[59:18] starts panicking and says he likes a
[59:20] look at all these so all these soldiers
[59:22] surrounding our city look at all these
[59:24] chariots and all the
[59:25] things and you know what Elijah does he
[59:28] doesn't even look at the problem you
[59:32] know what he starts praying for you know
[59:33] most of us would be like look hard
[59:35] there's nothing about this
[59:37] Oh God you see all that army you see all
[59:40] that no that's not what he did he
[59:45] started praying for his servant he said
[59:49] he said Lord show him what I'm looking
[59:53] at right now so Elijah would not have
[1:00:00] been in that position if that piece of
[1:00:01] God was on are already there amen he
[1:00:04] knew that that that God was on the scene
[1:00:07] amen and then so he wanted his servant
[1:00:10] to know that God was on the scene amen
[1:00:13] and that's what God is trying wants us
[1:00:16] to know tonight Saints is that he's on
[1:00:19] the scene tonight amen you may not see
[1:00:23] it but God sees it you see it in his
[1:00:27] word and that's good enough you see it
[1:00:30] in his promises that's good enough he
[1:00:33] promised it in his word and you know he
[1:00:35] cannot lie and so Elijah he prays for
[1:00:38] his servant and he says-- has open his
[1:00:41] eyes that he may see what I'm looking at
[1:00:43] and God answers his prayer and all of a
[1:00:45] sudden he sees that there's more
[1:00:47] chariots more so more more angels and
[1:00:52] all kinds of being celestial beings
[1:00:54] watching over the whole over not just
[1:00:57] them the whole city of Dothan
[1:01:02] amen but Elijah was not looking at the
[1:01:07] problem at first then he goes ahead and
[1:01:10] addresses the problem after he prayed
[1:01:14] for his servant then he goes ahead just
[1:01:16] as the problem then he prays Lord
[1:01:18] now put blindness on the soldiers he
[1:01:22] he's he was worried more about the
[1:01:24] spiritual blindness of his of his
[1:01:26] servant than his than the physical
[1:01:28] blindness of the soldiers first he was
[1:01:30] see he was more worried about the
[1:01:32] spiritual things amen before the
[1:01:34] physical things amen that's a lesson for
[1:01:38] us
[1:01:39] we're so worried about the physical
[1:01:42] things of life what we're gonna eat
[1:01:44] what's Russia gonna do to us what's
[1:01:47] what's what's uh what we're gonna how we
[1:01:49] gonna pay this how are we gonna do this
[1:01:51] how are we gonna take our kids through
[1:01:53] school are we gonna you know there was a
[1:01:56] story one time with the lady avocado
[1:01:58] lady have you ever heard of that
[1:02:02] the avocado lady sat down under a
[1:02:05] travaux cadeau tree one time and she
[1:02:09] said you know what she was about 21
[1:02:12] years old she started thinking she said
[1:02:15] you know when I get to about 25 there's
[1:02:17] a man that's probably gonna ask me to
[1:02:19] marry him and then we're gonna marry and
[1:02:24] we're gonna have about two or three
[1:02:27] children and then we're going to raise
[1:02:32] we need to find a good a good house for
[1:02:35] them to be able to raise them in and be
[1:02:37] near a good school and in their mine
[1:02:41] what am I gonna do when when it comes
[1:02:43] time what with what money am I gonna be
[1:02:46] able to pay for for their diapers and to
[1:02:48] buy the milk and to do all these things
[1:02:50] and when my husband goes to work all day
[1:02:53] long and I'm there at home with the
[1:02:55] children and all of a sudden an avocado
[1:02:57] follows from and hits around the head
[1:03:00] and kills her and all that worrying was
[1:03:05] for nothing right that's how it is the
[1:03:13] avocado lady wearing for nothing
[1:03:18] worrying about the most pit petty things
[1:03:21] ain't meant worrying about physical
[1:03:23] things yeah I reacted the same way when
[1:03:28] I first heard that story to worrying
[1:03:32] about physical things of life when God
[1:03:34] said I've already taken care of that and
[1:03:36] let's worry about the spiritual stuff
[1:03:38] first
[1:03:38] he likes to worried about his servant
[1:03:41] first open his eyes spiritually first so
[1:03:45] that then you could go ahead and do
[1:03:46] whatever you want to with the army amen
[1:03:48] praise the Lord
[1:03:50] amen the avocado lady how many of us
[1:03:54] aren't like the avocado lady sometimes
[1:03:56] no what's that what don't say that
[1:03:58] you've never been that way before
[1:04:00] because I have and then everything that
[1:04:04] you're so fearful about it doesn't even
[1:04:07] happen that with the way you thought all
[1:04:09] it is is just it's just fear
[1:04:11] it's just presumptions in your head and
[1:04:14] then Satan's there yes that's right
[1:04:16] that's it that's right that's what's
[1:04:19] gonna happen that's right and you're
[1:04:22] right they're just right but that's what
[1:04:31] he wants he wants to rob you from your
[1:04:32] peace so that he can keep you from
[1:04:35] serving God amen praise the Lord Jesus
[1:04:40] you love the Lord amen praise God
[1:04:45] so Saints when when the problems come
[1:04:48] amen know that God is keeping you when
[1:04:52] his peace is reigning within when bad
[1:04:57] news comes amen you don't react all of a
[1:05:01] sudden you wait and say Lord there's a
[1:05:06] reason why this is happening
[1:05:08] that's the peace of God amen John
[1:05:13] chapter 16 verse 33 it says these things
[1:05:19] Jesus speaking these things I have
[1:05:21] spoken unto you that in me you might
[1:05:26] have peace there's no P there's peace
[1:05:30] out there's no peace outside of this
[1:05:32] word Saints it's no peace outside of
[1:05:34] Christ there's no peace and Fox News
[1:05:37] there's no peace and in in in what the
[1:05:41] government can do for you there's no
[1:05:43] peace there's nobody brother Dale can't
[1:05:45] even do there's things that Rodell can't
[1:05:47] do for you amen brother wait I can't do
[1:05:49] anything for you amen Bible says buh
[1:05:53] cursed be the man or who trust in a man
[1:05:58] you see you can't have trust in no man
[1:06:02] much as we appreciate our pastor but you
[1:06:04] can't trust no man that's why we pray
[1:06:07] for brother Dale we keep him under
[1:06:09] prayer we keep the Saints the ministers
[1:06:12] everybody here on the prayer amen
[1:06:14] praise God trust no man the Bible says
[1:06:17] and I believe is Jeremiah that says that
[1:06:22] all these things that Satan has throwing
[1:06:27] all these spiritual bombs all from every
[1:06:29] angle coming at you from every angle
[1:06:31] Saints if you're here right now if
[1:06:34] you're still here amen it's because God
[1:06:37] has kept you right and you're here
[1:06:40] because he's not done with you you're
[1:06:42] here still because he's still you still
[1:06:45] have a work to finish amen for him amen
[1:06:49] how many times that you've been riding
[1:06:51] down the road and all of a sudden you
[1:06:53] know somebody just pulls out in front of
[1:06:55] you and you could have had the worst
[1:06:56] accident ever probably caused you to
[1:06:59] lose your life and the life of the other
[1:07:01] person but you know what God stopped
[1:07:03] that car don't think that just happened
[1:07:06] just to happen no God did that the
[1:07:09] Angels amen God's whole infantry was
[1:07:12] right there right man he took care of
[1:07:16] that situation amen
[1:07:20] when the times amen when when my wife
[1:07:23] when she's lost she's lost both of her
[1:07:25] parents and by cancer you know and those
[1:07:28] who've gone through that know what
[1:07:30] that's like but going through something
[1:07:34] like that one year after another and yet
[1:07:39] the peace of God reigns in her you know
[1:07:42] she came to a point where she had said
[1:07:44] Lord it's all in your hands and you know
[1:07:47] what we weren't worried about my
[1:07:50] mother-in-law amen but I believe at the
[1:07:52] end time I meant because of my test
[1:07:54] wife's testimony my wife stayed right
[1:07:57] there telling my dad about the Word of
[1:07:59] God teaching him about the Word of God
[1:08:01] as he was laying on his deathbed and he
[1:08:03] had so much trust in what she was
[1:08:05] telling him amen now I believe I believe
[1:08:08] that we're gonna see him again
[1:08:09] amen praise God but there has to be that
[1:08:15] she has pieced she had she had to have
[1:08:18] that piece in her in order to input and
[1:08:20] part that piece praise God you have to
[1:08:23] have peace in your heart in order to
[1:08:24] impart peace but if there's no peace in
[1:08:27] your heart you're constantly worried and
[1:08:29] sick and-and-and-and-and constantly in
[1:08:32] fear amen
[1:08:33] you can't impart peace to nobody because
