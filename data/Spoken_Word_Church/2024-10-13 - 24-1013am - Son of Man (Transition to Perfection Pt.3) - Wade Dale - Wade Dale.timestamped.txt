[37:07] appreciate brother
[37:09] Aaron n yeah that guy that spoke
[37:13] Wednesday night I almost had it but he
[37:16] did a real good job we sure appreciate
[37:18] them also remember uh if you want to
[37:21] look on Hickory Bible
[37:23] Tabernacle um you can see what they're
[37:25] doing uh we gave money to them and also
[37:29] to brother Donnie's church I believe we
[37:31] need to take care of our own before we
[37:33] take care of others and um we don't know
[37:37] of any believers that are struggling but
[37:39] we know that some of them lost
[37:41] everything they had and there's no
[37:43] insurance for some of that so so you
[37:45] think about what situation you'd be in
[37:48] if that happened to you so we just keep
[37:49] them in prayer and we're also going to
[37:51] continue to send funds to them as we can
[37:54] to help them in their relief effort all
[37:57] right

[41:39] anoint us father for this journey in
[41:40] Jesus name amen so we're still on we're
[41:44] in the layout of sin Church age now
[41:46] listen like I said before you are in
[41:48] that church age we're not speaking of
[41:51] Luther we're not speaking of Wesley that
[41:54] was history they're actually in history
[41:56] books
[41:58] right but remember this is the mystery
[42:01] that's to be revealed in the end time I
[42:05] still I'm working on 20-some scriptures
[42:08] if you've got some I'd like to see them
[42:10] anything pertaining to the end time
[42:12] there are many scriptures that says
[42:14] Daniel I'm going to read it to you in a
[42:16] minute Daniel shut up shut it up till
[42:18] the time of the end right so let's
[42:24] read someone said if you change the way
[42:26] you look at things me the things you
[42:28] look at
[42:30] change that's
[42:32] profound if you change the way you look
[42:34] at things everybody wants you to look
[42:37] the way they
[42:38] look no that's not the way God
[42:41] is uh we can't tell God a better way to
[42:44] do
[42:44] anything no don't even try uh he's not
[42:47] even listening okay but you know what'll
[42:50] happen the devil will move in he said
[42:52] yeah you can change that hello that's
[42:54] what he
[42:55] did through man he changed the
[42:59] Bible all right if you change the way
[43:01] you look at things the things you look
[43:02] at change but what do we we're human
[43:05] beings and what's the first thing we
[43:06] hate we hate change but change me
[43:11] Lord change me oh God as the scripture
[43:15] as the song says so let's read
[43:16] Revelations 3:14 now this is to me and
[43:19] you so this scripture is to us yes to
[43:22] the angel of the Church of the layout of
[43:23] sins right these things sayith the amen
[43:26] the faithful and true true witness the
[43:28] beginning of the creation of God that's
[43:30] real funny that he said the
[43:32] beginning cuz it looks like this is the
[43:34] end that's the last Church age that's
[43:36] the end of it but we'll get to it in
[43:38] just a little bit I Know Thy works that
[43:40] thou are neither cold nor hot I would
[43:42] thou work cold or hot so then because
[43:46] Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor
[43:48] heart I will spew thee out of my mouth
[43:50] because thou says I am rich and
[43:52] increased with goods and have need of
[43:53] nothing that number 22 there in red
[43:57] there's 22 million millionaires in the
[44:01] United
[44:02] States 22 million millionaires in the
[44:06] United States one out of every
[44:08] eight like I said before I'm we're all
[44:11] in that seven we ain't that
[44:13] one maybe some of you are I don't know
[44:16] but 20 so there we have increase with
[44:18] Goods have need of nothing and knowest
[44:21] not that thou are wretched miserable
[44:23] poor blind and naked in other words you
[44:25] think you got it but you got nothing
[44:27] yeah right as brother John is saying you
[44:29] know it's good to be good with your
[44:31] finances it's good to do all that but
[44:33] you got to put the word of God first
[44:35] when you do put the word of God first
[44:36] then he'll teach you how to do these
[44:37] other things amen I counsel thee to buy
[44:39] of me gold tried in the fire that thou
[44:41] mayest be rich see not rich like The 22
[44:44] million rich like The richness of God in
[44:47] the word of God and white rment that
[44:50] thou mayest be clothed and that the
[44:51] shame of thy nakedness do not appear and
[44:54] anoint thine eyes with I say that thou
[44:55] mayest see as many as I love now look as
[44:59] many as I love I rebuke and chasen
[45:01] that's what he's been doing be zealous
[45:03] therefore and repent behold I stand at
[45:06] the door and knock If any man hear my
[45:07] voice and open the door I will come to
[45:10] him and will s with him and he with me
[45:14] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[45:16] sit with me now watch in my Throne not
[45:19] on in my throne even as I also overcame
[45:22] and him sit down with my father in his
[45:24] throne he that hath an ear let him hear
[45:27] what the spirit says to the churches you
[45:29] may be seated in the Lord as his
[45:30] Blessing to the reading of the word as
[45:32] we get started
[45:35] here we're going we're transitioning
[45:37] from partial to perfect or from okay
[45:42] transitioning
[45:43] from one thing to another to transition
[45:48] as we're going to look at before that
[45:49] means you have to make a move there's
[45:51] something changing and we're going to
[45:53] read here in a little bit brother Brown
[45:54] said that's what happened to the
[45:56] Pentecostal people people they wouldn't
[45:58] change they cabbage down on this the
[46:00] gifts is the speaking in tongues is the
[46:02] gifts and this is the latter rain
[46:04] movement and this is it and this is it
[46:06] well what did Brother rown do he said oh
[46:08] no he said you don't even have the
[46:09] former Reign yet we're God's moving on
[46:13] God's ever moving whether you want to
[46:15] move or not God's ever moving and listen
[46:18] I'll promise you we read the back of the
[46:20] book there's a group of people that will
[46:22] move with him yes sir you got to decide
[46:24] whether you will or
[46:25] not first Corinthians says charity never
[46:29] faileth see we want something that
[46:31] doesn't fail we've all listen this
[46:34] government is failing us all of the
[46:36] economy is going to fail us everything
[46:38] in this world's going to even our bodies
[46:40] are failing us
[46:43] amen well some of you young people
[46:44] didn't say Amen but us older ones said
[46:46] amen our B everything's failing us but
[46:49] the love of God will never fail you and
[46:52] you got to have that love of God in your
[46:54] soul that's the new birth that's not
[46:56] just loving God with your voice or your
[46:59] head amen it's from your heart all
[47:03] right where there be prophecies they
[47:05] shall fail whether there be tongues they
[47:09] shall cease whether there be knowledge
[47:12] it shall Bish away for we know in part
[47:16] and we prophesy in part but when that
[47:18] which is perfect is come there's one of
[47:20] your end time
[47:21] scriptures when that which is perfect is
[47:24] come now God's always been perfect he's
[47:26] looking for a perfect people that will
[47:28] say that they're
[47:30] perfect all
[47:32] right then that which is in part shall
[47:34] be done away not done away like you're
[47:37] gone no we build on that Foundation we
[47:40] build man built a car on an A-frame one
[47:43] time they call it an a model then they
[47:45] built it on a a t- model because it was
[47:48] built on a t frame but we don't live in
[47:51] them days anymore we drive electric cars
[47:54] and cars that don't even have a frame
[47:57] but that's man progressing as man
[48:00] progresses then you ought to look at God
[48:02] and see how he progresses first right
[48:05] that's for each one of us Paul said when
[48:07] I was a child I spake as a child there's
[48:09] not a problem being a child there's not
[48:11] a problem starting as a baby but let's
[48:13] don't be 30 years down the road in our
[48:15] Christian journey and still be a
[48:21] baby and you the only one that knows it
[48:23] and now people around you will
[48:25] too when I was a child I spake as a
[48:27] child doesn't everybody know when
[48:28] there's a kid in the house right doesn't
[48:30] everybody know when there's a kid in the
[48:31] in the uh uh in the room and what's the
[48:34] first thing you
[48:36] do wake up David he was
[48:40] awake but you know there's a kid there
[48:42] when there's a kid in the room you know
[48:44] he's there all right they're usually not
[48:46] very silent unless they're asleep and
[48:48] then you've had to put them to sleep
[48:49] because they were
[48:50] crying but let's not be that let's be
[48:54] mature adults when I was a child I spake
[48:57] as a child now look I understood as a
[49:00] child I thought as a child but when I
[49:02] became a man I put away childish
[49:04] things as brother Steven Wilson was
[49:07] saying you know 1 plus one is two that's
[49:09] pretty slow and pretty Elementary but
[49:10] you got to have that to get to the rest
[49:12] of it for now we see through a glass
[49:15] Darkly now this is Paul but then to face
[49:18] to face I want you to get something
[49:20] today you're a special group of
[49:23] people God's brought you to this message
[49:27] give you something to look at he's give
[49:30] you tapes books now MP3s now computers
[49:36] now whatever you can you can stick it in
[49:38] your ear and listen to the prophet where
[49:40] you used to have to have a 7in reel the
[49:42] thing is this big trust me we have them
[49:44] in the floor at the house all the time
[49:46] cuz that's about the only place it fit
[49:48] it was so big it was one tape at a time
[49:51] and if that tape got stretched out the
[49:53] voice got stretched out but now you've
[49:54] got it in crystal clear
[49:58] press play anytime you want
[50:00] to but they didn't they didn't even have
[50:03] a Bible before Luther remember before
[50:07] Luther there was no
[50:09] Bible Columba didn't have one all the
[50:12] other ones didn't have one but we have
[50:14] everything we need that's why we in
[50:17] America are going to get it as brother
[50:19] Bram said we're going to get it worse
[50:20] than anybody because we had a Prophet
[50:23] come that we didn't need an
[50:25] interpreter we heard in our own
[50:28] language he came here to give us a
[50:31] message and I'll promise you when you
[50:34] look at that scripture that says behold
[50:36] I stand at the door and knock now I know
[50:38] that's Jesus Christ but brother brandham
[50:40] was Jesus Christ of this age oh come on
[50:45] it's the only Jesus they'll ever see and
[50:47] what was he doing after he got to preach
[50:49] the word he had to knock at the door to
[50:52] get into those denominations and they
[50:53] shut the door and wouldn't let him in
[50:56] because he was preaching Jesus Christ he
[50:59] started preaching the son of man
[51:00] Ministry now I want you to get something
[51:02] before you pass
[51:04] out brother brandom's message is in two
[51:07] parts if you've been here long enough
[51:09] you've known brother D's preached this
[51:10] for Years brother Brown's message is in
[51:14] two
[51:14] parts right and I'll read it here in a
[51:17] little while he come to do what restore
[51:19] us back bring that Foundation as
[51:22] zerubabel took and swept off the
[51:24] foundation and started building holding
[51:26] it
[51:28] right the gifts coming back he brought
[51:31] back the uh loose ends as he said which
[51:34] is the false doctrine that was down
[51:36] through the church ages that God winked
[51:37] at but that wasn't his
[51:40] message that was a preparation for a
[51:43] message to come and as I said before he
[51:46] was still preaching up until 1962 or so
[51:49] that spoken words Original Seed he had
[51:51] been speaking in the son of man
[51:53] Revelation or the Cornerstone
[51:57] are the man
[51:59] anointing everybody with me the eagle
[52:02] anointing only came when that book came
[52:04] open right all right when that book came
[52:06] open the seals were were preached and
[52:08] revealed under his ministry and all
[52:10] these other great things that happened
[52:12] under his ministry third pole speaking
[52:14] of the word squirrels and all that when
[52:16] all that happened and culminated in a
[52:18] message we'll read it here in just a
[52:19] little bit that was the real reason he
[52:22] was
[52:23] sent there was your Malachi 4 anointing
[52:27] in so he's two parts 47 to 63 he was
[52:32] trying to get them out of that
[52:34] Pentecostal age into a bride age or a
[52:38] new age the beginning of the creation of
[52:41] God he was trying to get them out of
[52:44] that come out of her my people but they
[52:47] just stayed
[52:48] there then I'll read you quote here in
[52:50] just a few minutes brother R said some
[52:52] of these people will take this message
[52:55] and break it down
[52:57] right and that's us that's all the
[52:59] messages we've been hearing God has
[53:02] broke this thing down and what we're
[53:04] doing now is we've got to what setting
[53:07] in the presence of the Sun and ring the
[53:09] s o n not the Su n cuz we've come to
[53:12] full grain folks whether you believe it
[53:15] or not we've come to The Headstone the
[53:18] headship of the word of God this
[53:20] transition to Perfection involves
[53:23] you it involves you it doesn't involve
[53:26] the fre listen it doesn't involve
[53:28] William brandom on it's the days of the
[53:32] voice of that seventh angel when he
[53:35] begins to Proclaim his message the only
[53:39] way he proclaimed his message is through
[53:41] a group of people
[53:43] absolutely that's true you can read all
[53:45] you want to you got all the like I said
[53:47] before everything when I go down the
[53:48] road today I can turn on a sermon
[53:50] anywhere around the world going down the
[53:52] road I can listen to Archive sermons I
[53:55] whatever going down the road Road you
[53:57] couldn't do that with a 7 in
[53:59] reel you might do it with one but you
[54:01] couldn't take eight or 10 with you you'd
[54:02] have to throw your hunting stuff out
[54:05] which we would but we know now it's on
[54:07] just a little bitty thing it's actually
[54:08] in your phone which is cooked up to your
[54:11] car
[54:11] now so listen we don't have any
[54:15] excuse we have none God has took every
[54:18] excuse out of our way absolutely he's
[54:20] give us the word of God he's give us
[54:22] able ministers and and just to put a
[54:25] rose uh dad's gone on but I'll give him
[54:28] another one we didn't have to worry
[54:29] through and Wade through false
[54:32] Doctrine a lot of other people
[54:35] churches they had to weigh through false
[54:39] Doctrine there's several come up with
[54:41] this kind of Doctrine and then that
[54:42] where you come that you polygamy was
[54:45] okay and then the the Thunders was we
[54:47] were already in the Millennium and the
[54:48] Thunders were seven different people and
[54:50] we never had to deal with that but
[54:53] listen more is given
[54:56] more is
[54:58] required and I'm saying that loud more
[55:01] is
[55:03] required so we can't sit there and say
[55:06] we don't know we've been listening for
[55:08] 50 years what's it been doing for us
[55:11] that's right that's right I'm talking
[55:13] right here back that
[55:15] way that's true now I know in
[55:19] part but then shall I know even as also
[55:23] I am known I don't know that Paul
[55:25] thought he was was the first church age
[55:27] messenger but he'll know he knows it
[55:29] now and now abide faith hope and charity
[55:32] these three but the greatest of these is
[55:35] a gape love or the word of God to you
[55:38] and me you can you can put it in
[55:41] everything you want to Brother John you
[55:42] can say it's this it's a feeling it's an
[55:44] emotion it is the word of God sent to
[55:48] you that is the love of
[55:50] God for God so loved the world that he
[55:53] sent the
[55:54] word his only begotten son that was the
[55:57] word he sent his
[55:58] word to tell us the mind of God then he
[56:02] sent us a prophet in the end time to
[56:05] reveal all the things have been shut out
[56:07] of the mind of God come on somebody that
[56:10] man's ideas has shut it

[56:24] in then we we had Elijah come at the end
[56:28] of that Holy Ghost age no Messenger to
[56:31] bring us a message to call to lay out of
[56:34] sins out of that Pentecostal era into
[56:39] the full word of God or you see that
[56:42] word says
[56:43] eternity that's what he preached us into
[56:46] nobody else could do that right no great
[56:49] man could do that only a prophet could
[56:52] take the Eternal Mind Of God bring it to
[56:54] a group of people and we understand

[59:43] it cuz you were
[59:45] there and God was nowhere around yeah oh
[59:47] yeah he was there in his predestinated
[59:50] plant he was there in his when he the
[59:54] the woman at the well he said she had
[59:56] representation the representation is as
[59:58] brother B was talking about the other
[59:59] Sunday is that God knew he'd cross your
[1:00:02] path and you'd accept it and it was your
[1:00:05] choice so you can say it was my choice
[1:00:08] but no in God's eyes no we didn't have a
[1:00:11] choice I said in God's mind he can't
[1:00:15] change he can't even have a choice he
[1:00:17] made
[1:00:18] one that you were that Genesis 126 man
[1:00:21] you know what that's my first scripture
[1:00:24] for this end time message
[1:00:26] that's my first scripture because you
[1:00:28] and I are going to be that completeness
[1:00:30] on Earth just like God wanted it in the
[1:00:32] Garden of
[1:00:33] Eden before we leave this place when our
[1:00:36] bodies are changed back come on somebody
[1:00:39] when our bodies are changed back to
[1:00:40] young men and women that is that Genesis
[1:00:43] 126 man in Flesh on the Earth all hell's
[1:00:46] going to break loose and we're going
[1:00:48] praise
[1:00:50] godl we going to walk out of the Tomb
[1:00:52] and they going to say all power in
[1:00:53] heaven and earth been given unto me amen
[1:00:55] just like Jesus did oh that's too rich
[1:00:58] that ain't Rich
[1:01:03] enough spill some water it's okay Mom
[1:01:07] Mom's not here but I did sorry now watch
[1:01:11] he had to give us he before he could
[1:01:14] come in it who's it
[1:01:17] you before he could come in it he had to
[1:01:20] give us the baptism of fire that's why
[1:01:24] the tongues of fire were on those people
[1:01:25] and remember that tongue of fire didn't
[1:01:28] leave it sunk right down in
[1:01:31] them remember that word uded with power
[1:01:34] from on high ued means embedded or put
[1:01:38] in the Holy listen the Holy Ghost can
[1:01:40] anoint you and then leave the Holy Ghost
[1:01:43] could anoint Kus and leave the holy
[1:01:46] listen to me the Holy Ghost could anoint
[1:01:48] Judas because he did anoint Judas Judas
[1:01:51] Judas preached the message
[1:01:56] just as good as the other 11 because the
[1:01:58] other 11 were
[1:02:00] deceived he was such a good
[1:02:03] preacher so he deceived those other
[1:02:07] 11 then the Holy Ghost come in and live
[1:02:11] baptism of fire then when you get that
[1:02:14] baptism of fire then the Holy Ghost can
[1:02:17] come in yes remember sanctification
[1:02:21] cleans you sets you aside for service
[1:02:24] but doesn't put you in service because
[1:02:26] because you're still open you're open to
[1:02:29] the devil to come back but once you get
[1:02:31] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and burns
[1:02:34] all that out yes your Soul's just as
[1:02:37] Eternal as God is when he comes back in
[1:02:39] dwelling inside of you absolutely I said
[1:02:41] you're just as Eternal as God is
[1:02:44] abely then the Holy Ghost can come in
[1:02:47] what as it does it burns up everything
[1:02:50] contrary to the word out of you now we
[1:02:53] got a long way to go because remember in
[1:02:56] your soul you're Eternal in your soul
[1:02:58] you're complete in your soul you're
[1:03:00] you're sitting in Heavenly places but we
[1:03:02] got a spirit realm that's still caught
[1:03:04] in this Dimension yes sir we got a
[1:03:05] spirit realm that still got that adamic
[1:03:07] nature attached to it that makes us
[1:03:09] think wrong do wrong act wrong do the
[1:03:11] things wrong that we brother Brown says
[1:03:13] we sin every
[1:03:18] day I was looking at
[1:03:20] a at a piece of literature and they were
[1:03:23] talking about lying people lie
[1:03:27] and ow they come up with this if if it's
[1:03:30] wrong they're lying anyhow um they said
[1:03:34] the average human being listen to this
[1:03:36] the average human being lies four times
[1:03:39] a day average human being now we met
[1:03:43] some that way above that
[1:03:46] average I Ain't Met many as below it but
[1:03:49] we met a bunch that was above
[1:03:52] it guy we used to hunt with he'd tell a
[1:03:54] lie and he'd believe it
[1:03:57] self remember it right T yeah oh I ain't
[1:04:00] going to call his name but yeah he just
[1:04:02] he' tell you a lie before he could tell
[1:04:04] you the truth and then he sit there and
[1:04:05] make you believe it because he kept
[1:04:06] telling it over and over
[1:04:08] again ain't that what Satan
[1:04:11] does he keeps telling you the same lie
[1:04:14] and listen God says in the scripture
[1:04:16] that he'll let Satan do that and you
[1:04:18] believe it scripture says and be damned
[1:04:22] by it cuz you going to just keep oh I
[1:04:25] believe that
[1:04:28] if it's contrary to the word of God it's
[1:04:30] not of God period that's why we sin you
[1:04:33] know why we sin every day we have bad
[1:04:35] thoughts we don't have to physically sin
[1:04:39] like we sinned before BC before Christ
[1:04:42] everybody with me you're living in sin
[1:04:44] because you have to eat you're living in
[1:04:47] sin because you get tired you're living
[1:04:49] in sin because a lot of y'all are
[1:04:51] gray-headed that
[1:04:53] weren't or no hair
[1:04:57] or
[1:04:59] worse but that see that's why this body
[1:05:01] is the sin part when brother BR said you
[1:05:04] sin every day that doesn't mean we go
[1:05:05] out and drink and smoke no no we just
[1:05:08] have bad thoughts we are contrary to God
[1:05:11] being in this Dimension we're contrary
[1:05:13] to God so just accept that and say okay
[1:05:16] God you knew this was going to happen
[1:05:18] you knew before the foundation of the
[1:05:19] world this is what was going to happen
[1:05:21] now for you to get a hold of me you're
[1:05:24] going to have to do it yes you're going
[1:05:27] to have to keep me from sinning cuz I
[1:05:30] can't now listen if we do have a problem
[1:05:32] with all the smoking and drinking and
[1:05:33] cussing and all that stuff you're not
[1:05:35] born again let's let's ratchet back over
[1:05:37] this way a little bit all right when
[1:05:40] brother BR said you sin every day he's
[1:05:41] talking about Christians he said
[1:05:42] Christians sin every
[1:05:46] day but
[1:05:47] look but it's got to be the entire word
[1:05:50] we're looking today at the entire word
[1:05:53] of God open so that you can understand
[1:05:56] it but it's got to be the entire word to
[1:05:59] be the bride you have to be a part of
[1:06:02] him he is the word and what a part of
[1:06:05] him is it the word that's promised for
[1:06:08] this day yes Luther was promised
[1:06:11] justification in another day his
[1:06:14] justification will just barely get you
[1:06:15] in
[1:06:17] church come
[1:06:19] on if y'all going to sleep then um you
[1:06:23] going to have a long
[1:06:24] day the word that's promised for this
[1:06:27] day when he calls his bride I was I was
[1:06:29] I sinned yesterday I watched Tennessee
[1:06:31] football game but it was
[1:06:34] 105,000 josi don't smile there was aund
[1:06:38] hey Livia there was
[1:06:41] 105,000
[1:06:42] people in one place watching 22
[1:06:49] people kick a ball around and beat each
[1:06:52] other up
[1:06:55] yeah they never sat down the whole
[1:06:57] game cuz Tennessee won in overtime
[1:07:01] 105,000 they weren't doing
[1:07:07] this no 105,000 this section wore all
[1:07:13] white this section wore
[1:07:16] all orange this section wore all white
[1:07:20] they got
[1:07:22] prepared come on
[1:07:26] cuz they had to be coordinated you could
[1:07:28] put 105,000 in there and and 10,000 be
[1:07:31] white white shirts and 10,000 be orange
[1:07:34] and white and orange that had to be
[1:07:36] coordinated why can't we do that in the
[1:07:38] gospel and I'm talking about me too why
[1:07:40] can't we be so
[1:07:41] happy that God's give us a a stadium to
[1:07:45] sit
[1:07:47] in and I promise you those 22 people's
[1:07:49] on the field today they're
[1:07:53] sore and a couple of them got knocked
[1:07:55] out of the game and they probably have
[1:07:57] injuries is going to haunt them for the
[1:07:58] rest of their
[1:08:02] life enough of
[1:08:07] that what is there to get excited about
[1:08:09] I mean that's temporal anyway all that's
[1:08:12] temporal stuff that's why I said all
[1:08:14] this is a lie it's all temporal It's All
[1:08:15] Temporary everything you see in your
[1:08:18] daily walk is
[1:08:21] temporary has an end to it the only
[1:08:25] thing doesn't have an end is that word
[1:08:26] of God that you take in your soul and
[1:08:29] you apply it to your life amen remember
[1:08:32] Don't Preach me a sermon live me one
[1:08:35] don't tell me what the word says live
[1:08:37] what the word
[1:08:38] says I can set up here and tell you what
[1:08:40] the word says and you just it don't do
[1:08:42] any good but live it those people on the
[1:08:46] day of Pentecost they were happy they
[1:08:48] received something nobody ever received
[1:08:50] before in their soul they received the
[1:08:51] new birth right in their soul happy
[1:08:56] run
[1:08:57] outside Paul says this Peter says this
[1:09:00] is that this is what was we were ready
[1:09:03] for this don't you remember Jesus told
[1:09:05] us all these
[1:09:07] things it got quickened the word got
[1:09:10] quickened in their heart so now let's
[1:09:13] jump up to isusa Street Pentecost now
[1:09:15] when we get to isusa Street Pentecost
[1:09:17] what has happened through six Church
[1:09:19] ages man has got involved and just
[1:09:21] totally deluded the word of God Mary was
[1:09:24] the mother of God
[1:09:26] baptism was different everything was
[1:09:28] different than the first church Age
[1:09:29] first two or three Church ages everybody
[1:09:31] with me there's denominations have been
[1:09:33] set up all these different camps and
[1:09:35] different
[1:09:38] ideas I like what brother Brandon was
[1:09:40] saying in here you know we used to read
[1:09:42] about
[1:09:43] Constantine how he was this great guy he
[1:09:46] was this you know Crusader and he had
[1:09:48] the crosses on his back and crosses on
[1:09:50] his shield what' brother Bram say he
[1:09:54] wasn't even
[1:09:56] converted he just had a dream that Satan
[1:09:58] could have give
[1:10:00] him come on somebody I believe if God
[1:10:03] give it to him he sure misinterpreted it
[1:10:05] wrong but Satan gave it to him and he
[1:10:07] started and put church and state
[1:10:09] together and that's what messed this
[1:10:10] whole thing up so he's not that very
[1:10:12] great of a man so now we've come to
[1:10:15] Pentecost zza Street we're coming up
[1:10:17] closer we're under the man anointing
[1:10:20] which man is smart shrewd yes very
[1:10:24] shrewd very smart
[1:10:26] Right Way smarter than the
[1:10:29] lion way smarter than the
[1:10:32] ox man has done all this in his
[1:10:36] smartness smartphones smart
[1:10:39] cars a lot of smart
[1:10:42] Alexs if you don't know what that is
[1:10:44] look at
[1:10:47] that but we're under the mount anointing
[1:10:50] until the full word of God opens to us
[1:10:53] all right we're under partial Revelation
[1:10:57] until the full word of God opens up all
[1:10:59] right so now
[1:11:03] watch brother Donald he okay he do okay
[1:11:06] all right Christine you you don't have
[1:11:08] her on okay she got it on usually
[1:11:10] Christine will go slow down slow
[1:11:14] down you see each one of these ages only
[1:11:18] taking a dip into the Holy Spirit now we
[1:11:20] have had people in the message say that
[1:11:21] well they were false so they didn't have
[1:11:23] listen if you got
[1:11:26] one
[1:11:28] molecule of the Holy Ghost in your soul
[1:11:31] you're just as Eternal as God is I said
[1:11:34] in your soul if he's in your soul today
[1:11:37] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost by the
[1:11:39] new birth you're just as Eternal as God
[1:11:42] is he took fishermen that couldn't they
[1:11:45] signed their name by X come that's right
[1:11:50] unlearned give them the Holy
[1:11:52] Ghost but it was a dip
[1:11:56] justification is a work of the Holy
[1:11:58] Spirit sanctification is a work of the
[1:11:59] Holy Spirit but the baptism is the holy
[1:12:03] spirit that's the reason it took a
[1:12:05] prophetic Prophet to come down now we're
[1:12:07] talking about brother brandham no
[1:12:09] Messenger to the age of the Pentecostal
[1:12:12] all right cuz there wasn't one at first
[1:12:14] the Alpha and Omega there wasn't one at
[1:12:15] the first there was a spokesman named
[1:12:17] Peter but they waited on Paul to get
[1:12:19] there to interpret the word of God from
[1:12:21] the mind of God everybody with
[1:12:24] me same thing over here if the alpha
[1:12:27] bride and omega's got to be bookends so
[1:12:29] there was a Pentecostal age that had no
[1:12:31] messenger the one ey black men Seymour
[1:12:34] param and all them they they they they
[1:12:37] tried they tried they did what God told
[1:12:39] them to do that's right they got the
[1:12:41] gifts restored and they started getting
[1:12:42] people in church and they started
[1:12:44] getting people filled with the Holy
[1:12:45] Ghost the real Holy Ghost cuz right here
[1:12:47] brother Brown said look the Holy Ghost
[1:12:50] came
[1:12:51] himself in his fullness of the baptism
[1:12:54] not partial in the fullness but what
[1:12:57] happened is they stayed there they
[1:12:59] didn't move
[1:13:01] on but you and I have moved on yes sir
[1:13:05] amen but at the end of the age as it
[1:13:07] always ends up the others what at the
[1:13:09] end of the Pentecostal
[1:13:11] age at the end of 1906 is zza Street
[1:13:14] which last till 1915 which continued on
[1:13:17] to about 1922 if you'll read your
[1:13:19] history and we went through that but at
[1:13:22] the end of that age as it always ends
[1:13:24] upon the others we find then a messenger
[1:13:27] sent a person identified in the word of
[1:13:31] God Malachi 4 was sent to those people
[1:13:35] but they put him out the
[1:13:40] door I got a book I'm going to read when
[1:13:42] I'm hunting it was it's like a list of
[1:13:45] Great Men John G Lake D Moody brother
[1:13:49] Brown's not even in that
[1:13:51] book Luther Wesley Billy Graham it's got
[1:13:54] it just names a whole bunch of people
[1:13:57] that were influential from from Luther
[1:14:00] all the way up to here sanki Benny
[1:14:02] Calvin all those different
[1:14:04] ones brother Brown's not in it at all
[1:14:07] you know why he's in God's
[1:14:09] General but remember what he they said
[1:14:11] in God's
[1:14:13] generals pretty much the healing
[1:14:15] campaign was all they were worried about
[1:14:16] when he started preaching they did away
[1:14:18] with him well guess what it wasn't this
[1:14:21] over here they were supposed to get
[1:14:24] right yeah it was this over here we'll
[1:14:27] read that in just a
[1:14:28] minute everybody all
[1:14:31] right but at the end of the age as it
[1:14:34] always ends up on the other messenger
[1:14:36] comes in the age we find there then the
[1:14:39] messenger sent and all these Scruples
[1:14:42] and things that are to be placed in
[1:14:43] their places see what zerubabel is doing
[1:14:47] see what Elijah did remember when the
[1:14:49] prophets of Baal what did they do they
[1:14:51] jumped up on they went to Mount Carmel
[1:14:53] jumped up the Altar and just tore it all
[1:14:54] to pieces
[1:14:55] and then Elijah before God came with the
[1:14:57] fire and got all the water and the
[1:14:59] sacrifice Elijah had to put them Stones
[1:15:02] back he was restoring worship he was
[1:15:05] restoring order in the
[1:15:08] church cuz they had got so out of order
[1:15:11] do as a Baptist do well yeah do as a
[1:15:12] Baptist do no no no we're Methodist
[1:15:14] let's do over here we're going to
[1:15:16] sprinkle God's not that
[1:15:19] confused right he has a word amen that
[1:15:25] we to
[1:15:27] follow things will be placed in their
[1:15:29] places that's why I said if you get
[1:15:31] nothing else today you are in the
[1:15:34] Perfection that God's been looking
[1:15:37] for I'm not saying this
[1:15:40] building I'm saying the ministry the
[1:15:42] only way you're going to get perfected
[1:15:43] is by what Apostles prophets pastors
[1:15:46] teachers and evangelists teaching and
[1:15:48] preaching the pure word of God that's
[1:15:49] the only way you're going to get
[1:15:51] perfected it's good to study come on now
[1:15:54] it's good to study makes my job a lot
[1:15:56] easier it's good to read and good to to
[1:15:58] to study and all that but you're not
[1:16:00] going to get it by yourself come on
[1:16:03] that's right I'll read it to you in a
[1:16:05] little bit now watch put in their place
[1:16:08] then the Rapture comes for the
[1:16:11] church so we went through the
[1:16:13] restoration the gifts we're not going to
[1:16:14] go through we'll go through all of them
[1:16:15] but not tell you what they are but we
[1:16:18] have this in our church we have gift of
[1:16:22] wisdom we have gift of knowledge
[1:16:26] Faith
[1:16:28] healing Miracles we've seen miracles in
[1:16:31] this
[1:16:32] congregation
[1:16:36] prophecy
[1:16:39] Amen brother colie in three days you go
[1:16:41] get your gun
[1:16:44] back that was a prophecy brother Dell
[1:16:47] said that from his Pulpit he got his gun
[1:16:49] stolen right right had his gun stolen
[1:16:53] and he told Brother Kylie he said you'll
[1:16:54] have that gun back in three days brother
[1:16:55] klie goes back home and another day or
[1:16:57] two after that the boy that stole it was
[1:16:59] sitting on the porch with the gun in his
[1:17:01] lap
[1:17:02] right and brought it back God had
[1:17:05] convicted him but it was a prophecy that
[1:17:07] come forth from
[1:17:09] here thank
[1:17:11] God so here's the one if if we we fail
[1:17:14] on speaking in tongues and
[1:17:16] interpretation of
[1:17:19] tongues but if you don't get what I'm
[1:17:21] saying today it's in an unknown tongue
[1:17:24] true
[1:17:26] it'll take the Holy Ghost to interpret
[1:17:27] it for you so why were we given these
[1:17:30] gifts why were we given why did the
[1:17:33] Pentecostals
[1:17:35] ad30
[1:17:37] because what did they do in the Old
[1:17:39] Testament as long as you made a
[1:17:41] sacrifice with a lamb or a bull or or or
[1:17:44] Ox I'm sorry an ox not a bull but an ox
[1:17:47] or a turtle dove you were
[1:17:50] fine
[1:17:52] amen but there had to be a transition
[1:17:54] from that Old Testament way to the New
[1:17:57] Testament yes all right so here Paul is
[1:18:00] explaining taking the Old Testament and
[1:18:03] bringing the New Testament alive from
[1:18:05] the Old Testament so here's brother
[1:18:07] random comes on the in the end time he's
[1:18:10] a prophet he here's only from
[1:18:12] God he takes all that that's been all
[1:18:14] muddled up and scrupled up and he takes
[1:18:17] it all and he puts it all together and
[1:18:19] says here this is the way we're supposed
[1:18:21] to do it right sisters are supposed to
[1:18:23] wear their dress is correct they're
[1:18:25] supposed to not cut their hair cuz
[1:18:26] remember the Pentecostal they got away
[1:18:28] from all that he said I come out here to
[1:18:30] California every year and he said your
[1:18:32] hair gets
[1:18:33] shorter
[1:18:35] amen but they were hearing the word of
[1:18:40] God now then there's other gifts that
[1:18:42] comes to the church after the pastor
[1:18:44] there's evangelist comes in and then
[1:18:46] there's teachers that's why I bring
[1:18:48] people in and I try to bring people in
[1:18:49] that'll help you and when they do help
[1:18:52] you I tell them you want every Minister
[1:18:54] that's preach for me that that I know of
[1:18:56] that I can remember I've told they
[1:18:58] always send me a text thank you for the
[1:18:59] offering thank you for letting me come
[1:19:01] you know what I tell them thank you for
[1:19:03] blessing my people amen if he didn't
[1:19:05] bless
[1:19:07] y'all he ain't coming back then there
[1:19:11] then there's evangelist we haven't had
[1:19:13] one like that so we're okay I try to vet
[1:19:17] them a little bit before they get here
[1:19:18] especially if I don't know
[1:19:21] them thank you Hey listen that's what
[1:19:24] I'm supposed to to do I'm supposed to
[1:19:25] watch after the Sheep not let the wolves
[1:19:27] in okay then there's teachers comes in
[1:19:31] and then there's prophets come in and
[1:19:32] then there's Apostles come in all these
[1:19:35] together working together with the gifts
[1:19:38] keeps the church
[1:19:40] perfected and clean and ready for the
[1:19:42] coming of the
[1:19:44] Lord so that's why God that's why they
[1:19:46] called gifts God gives a gift and listen
[1:19:49] he gives you the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:50] but he's not an ending Giver he never
[1:19:51] takes it away cuz remember there's a
[1:19:53] difference in prop phy and a
[1:19:57] prophet all right there is a difference
[1:19:59] in a prophet in a five-fold Ministry and
[1:20:01] a word Prophet like brother brandom
[1:20:04] was you got to separate them right
[1:20:06] brother random was all that but we got
[1:20:08] prophets in the land they they said
[1:20:10] there's one a brother over in Africa and
[1:20:12] he comes here and preaches tried to get
[1:20:13] him here and he's booked up but they say
[1:20:15] he's a prophet that he can discern
[1:20:16] things that's not brother randam brother
[1:20:19] random is one gift identified in Malachi
[1:20:23] 4 and he was it
[1:20:25] right and it's not a
[1:20:27] spirit among the people it was one man
[1:20:31] and then the holy ghost anoints that man
[1:20:33] to speak the word to me and you so we
[1:20:35] can put our confidence in brother
[1:20:36] brandom no in
[1:20:38] God now he yielded himself right
[1:20:43] everybody with
[1:20:44] me so now the first seal we found the
[1:20:47] studying of the scripture that the
[1:20:48] messenger to the age comes right at the
[1:20:50] end of the age every time Paul come at
[1:20:53] the End of the Age Irene IUS come at the
[1:20:55] End of the Age Martin End of the Age
[1:20:57] Luther the end of the Catholic age now
[1:20:59] what was the Catholic age that was
[1:21:00] Columba all right the Dark Ages and what
[1:21:04] Wesley at the end of the Lutheran age
[1:21:06] and the Pentecostals at the End of the
[1:21:08] Age of sanctification through the
[1:21:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost and at the end
[1:21:13] of the Pentecostal age now here he's
[1:21:15] saying where he stands without saying
[1:21:18] where he stands all
[1:21:21] right at the end of the Pentecostal Age
[1:21:24] We Are to receive according to the word
[1:21:26] what Malachi 4 as God helped me tonight
[1:21:29] to show you through here that we are to
[1:21:31] see or receive not a message but a
[1:21:34] messenger with a message all right a
[1:21:37] messenger that will take all these Loose
[1:21:39] Ends out there and reveal the whole
[1:21:42] Secret Of God for the rapturing of the
[1:21:44] church we believe he did that
[1:21:46] right Harvest Time
[1:21:49] 1964 and we didn't talk about this much
[1:21:51] when we talked about Pentecost
[1:21:54] but brother R covers it very well and if
[1:21:56] you if you're reading any of the message
[1:21:58] we know that Luther was the shoot two
[1:22:01] shoots Wesley was the
[1:22:04] stalk Pentecost was the shook the the as
[1:22:07] you take
[1:22:09] corn you can't eat it with a shuck on it
[1:22:12] you got to shuck it right so you got to
[1:22:14] pull the shuck away to get to the real
[1:22:16] grain same way with the grain of wheat
[1:22:18] you take wheat you got to do like this
[1:22:20] that's why they winnow it that's why
[1:22:21] they throw it up in the air the the Shu
[1:22:23] goes in one way seed goes down and
[1:22:26] they're separated all right everybody
[1:22:28] with me but what does a shook do if that
[1:22:31] corn just a regular corn that we grow if
[1:22:34] that corn Brother Gary just started
[1:22:35] growing with no shook wouldn't couldn't
[1:22:37] do it sun had burned it up PE worms
[1:22:42] would eat it but that shook is a carrier
[1:22:46] or a carrier of the life until the grain
[1:22:49] comes to full
[1:22:51] maturity now you and I are not shu
[1:22:56] we're full
[1:22:57] grain we just got a
[1:23:00] mature Pentecost protect listen to me
[1:23:03] Pentecost protected brother Bri's
[1:23:06] message so that it could get started
[1:23:09] right but it had to move
[1:23:11] on now look at that shuck what they do
[1:23:15] they spoke in tongues they act just
[1:23:17] exactly like they did at Pentecost and
[1:23:18] he talking about this Pentecost
[1:23:19] referring back to that Pentecost but if
[1:23:22] you'll cut that take that little thing
[1:23:24] pull it back in other words pull the
[1:23:25] Shook Back it's got many little Shooks
[1:23:28] in it and when you pull it back you see
[1:23:30] way back at the back of it you'll have
[1:23:33] to have a good glass looking back there
[1:23:35] there's a little teeny Bud of a grain
[1:23:37] coming on there is the real thing shu's
[1:23:42] not
[1:23:42] real how many of you eat a
[1:23:45] shook that's what I thought but that
[1:23:48] corn sure tastes good That Shook
[1:23:50] protects right that's right Pentecost
[1:23:53] was good at the time Pentecost was here
[1:23:56] right we can't get stuck in
[1:24:00] Pentecost there is the real thing what
[1:24:03] the shuck is a
[1:24:05] carrier why it has to be there to
[1:24:07] protect that
[1:24:09] grain look it's working in harmony but
[1:24:12] it's to protect that grain it's not
[1:24:15] grain it's to protect that grain now
[1:24:17] where the grain come from from the
[1:24:19] ground up through Luther cuz remember
[1:24:22] when the seed was planted it it looks
[1:24:24] just like that seed that's on the end of
[1:24:26] that plant everybody with me please
[1:24:28] don't get
[1:24:34] bored now where did the grain come from
[1:24:37] the ground up through Luther through
[1:24:39] them churches through Wesley and through
[1:24:41] there out through the tassel and now
[1:24:44] down into the shook now it looks just
[1:24:47] perfectly I mean a a big ear of corn
[1:24:50] looks real good when the shu's on it you
[1:24:51] got the tassel hanging off of it you
[1:24:53] know it's growing and you know when the
[1:24:55] tassel gets Brown and the shook starts
[1:24:57] pulling away a little bit you got a big
[1:24:59] old ear of corn but you don't run out
[1:25:01] there very first and start chucking it
[1:25:03] while it's still attached to the to the
[1:25:06] plant right you weit to it matures yes
[1:25:10] that's what it is with the word of God
[1:25:11] we've always had the mature word of God
[1:25:13] but
[1:25:14] man man has cut this thing
[1:25:17] down now it looks just perfectly no
[1:25:20] wonder Jesus said it would deceive the
[1:25:22] very elect if it were possible you know
[1:25:23] what he's telling he's telling the
[1:25:25] Pentecostals you're
[1:25:27] deceived that's why they hated him some
[1:25:29] of them ones that was a little bit
[1:25:30] spiritual they understood what he was
[1:25:31] saying and they kicked him
[1:25:34] out looks just like the grain right in
[1:25:37] the place the grain ought to be in other
[1:25:39] words the shu's not here and the seeds
[1:25:41] over here you don't have a Shu growing
[1:25:43] out of a corn stock and then the air
[1:25:45] corn over here it's inside it's all
[1:25:50] attached just looks just like the grain
[1:25:53] right in the place the grain ought to be
[1:25:55] but what
[1:25:57] happened it did the same thing that the
[1:26:00] others did before it it
[1:26:03] organized what did it become a
[1:26:06] carrier all right let's continue on so
[1:26:10] now we're going to
[1:26:11] look we're really we're talking about
[1:26:14] partial
[1:26:16] Revelation it's not verses but partial
[1:26:20] moving to perfect right now listen the
[1:26:22] words perfect always will be
[1:26:24] yes but we're the partial part you and I
[1:26:28] I know in part I prophesy in part but
[1:26:31] that which is perfect has
[1:26:32] come the part will be done away
[1:26:36] with Pentecost had a
[1:26:39] part but they weren't the
[1:26:42] seed so now as we transition the word
[1:26:45] transition means a change from one thing
[1:26:47] to the next either in action or state of
[1:26:50] being like the caterpillar when that
[1:26:52] caterpillar is born
[1:26:55] it has the butterfly inside of
[1:26:58] it but that caterpillar's got to eat the
[1:27:02] caterpillar is it
[1:27:06] shook cuz what happens you see those
[1:27:09] things on the side of a tree it's
[1:27:11] nothing but a
[1:27:13] shell like a Katie did in some of those
[1:27:16] I don't know what Katie did but ktie did
[1:27:18] it so maybe wake you up a little bit it
[1:27:22] is hot in here but you see that and
[1:27:24] there's nothing in it though what
[1:27:25] happened that life is gone and it's
[1:27:28] transitioned or transformed into a
[1:27:31] butterfly now what did the caterpillar
[1:27:33] have to do the caterpillar had to
[1:27:35] realize he was a caterpillar and start
[1:27:37] eating right and then what happened
[1:27:40] through transition or metamorphosis ever
[1:27:43] how you want to say it transition he
[1:27:44] transitioned into a butterfly the same
[1:27:47] life that was in a
[1:27:48] caterpillar but it didn't stay in that
[1:27:51] caterpillar it transformed itself into a
[1:27:53] butterfly
[1:27:54] same way with me and you by the
[1:27:56] transforming power of the Holy Ghost it
[1:27:58] trans it transitions us into God amen
[1:28:04] amen not like God so now we got to see
[1:28:08] in this transition period about halfway
[1:28:11] through if you want to know sit there
[1:28:12] for a little while You' be okay this is
[1:28:15] good I enjoyed I've enjoyed making this
[1:28:20] sermon but listen this ain't for me I
[1:28:23] know what I'm going to say it's for
[1:28:27] you so when we look at this trans why do
[1:28:29] we need a
[1:28:31] transition why do we need a
[1:28:35] transition we can't stay shuck Shuck's
[1:28:39] dead Shu dies after a while if you let
[1:28:42] that corn now now we take and shuck it
[1:28:44] when it's green cuz we like to eat it
[1:28:47] but now when I hun an Illinois they let
[1:28:49] that stock completely go to Brown it it
[1:28:53] look it it is dead
[1:28:56] and that corn is it the Shu starts
[1:28:58] pulling away
[1:28:59] itself but there is a IR corn this big
[1:29:03] and all the kernels are hard why they
[1:29:07] want that to plant that seed that's just
[1:29:10] like what went in the ground so they
[1:29:12] wanted all this had to
[1:29:14] die come on people all this had to die
[1:29:18] so that the grain could do what it's
[1:29:19] supposed to do they G to take that next
[1:29:21] year they gonna break it off of the cob
[1:29:24] they gonna go put it back in the ground
[1:29:25] and here the cycle goes
[1:29:27] again but you and I remember the Harvest
[1:29:30] is coming to take us out of here not
[1:29:32] replant us we're not coming to the
[1:29:35] replanting time this is Harvest and
[1:29:38] getting out of here time all right so
[1:29:41] there's a purpose for this transition
[1:29:43] then we have to have a vision knowing
[1:29:47] listen what would you be and I know you
[1:29:50] can't go backwards in time you
[1:29:52] can but but what would you be before
[1:29:55] there was this message what would you be
[1:29:57] before you even heard about even even if
[1:30:00] you were in a denomination and you just
[1:30:03] sat there sister Anna was in a Catholic
[1:30:05] church and and she knows it was just a
[1:30:08] formality the priest did everything for
[1:30:11] you don't get
[1:30:13] comfortable this and
[1:30:16] ain't but there was a but our Visions
[1:30:20] changed this world's deceived if if
[1:30:24] you're not born again today you're
[1:30:25] deceived the blinders are not off your
[1:30:28] eyes but when the blinders come off you
[1:30:31] see a vision you see actually the mind
[1:30:34] of God going to work is what you see the
[1:30:37] mind of God working in a group of people
[1:30:40] not in a building in a group of
[1:30:43] people that goes from here with a plan
[1:30:46] my plan is to get out of here my plan is
[1:30:48] not to be here when the bombs fall
[1:30:54] and you got to know what part you play
[1:30:56] your
[1:30:56] bride or I'm
[1:31:00] bride but am I a wife
[1:31:03] yet I'm looking at y'all are you a wife
[1:31:06] yet a wife is mature a bride's brand new
[1:31:11] a wife is maturity that's what he calls
[1:31:13] for in Revelations 19 that's another
[1:31:15] thing an end time scripture that we can
[1:31:17] look at that's pertinent to us so now
[1:31:20] look in Luke
[1:31:21] 8:14 and that which fell among Thorns as
[1:31:24] they which as he's talking about
[1:31:25] planting
[1:31:26] seed it came up when they heard go forth
[1:31:30] and are choked with cares and riches and
[1:31:33] pleasures of this life you see that more
[1:31:35] in this age than ever before why because
[1:31:38] we're living through it people will wait
[1:31:40] till Sunday to do
[1:31:43] something
[1:31:45] right brother klie that was not in our
[1:31:47] vocabulary when I was going to church my
[1:31:50] daddy worked his fingers of the bone six
[1:31:52] days
[1:31:54] that's right we going to church on
[1:31:57] Sunday it didn't matter hurricane high
[1:32:03] water but now people like well I got to
[1:32:05] go on Sunday I got to do this on Sunday
[1:32:07] and I know y'all have to travel and we
[1:32:08] got vacations and I do the same thing
[1:32:11] but just to wait till Sunday to oh shoot
[1:32:14] I got to change my oil my car like I do
[1:32:17] it for Monday cuz I can't get to
[1:32:20] work try doing it on Saturday
[1:32:26] well well listen this is scripture being
[1:32:27] fulfilled yes this is scripture talking
[1:32:30] about somebody that this is happening
[1:32:33] to this is not somebody or another age
[1:32:36] This Is Us blind riched miserable naked
[1:32:39] and don't know it
[1:32:41] right when they heard it they're choked
[1:32:43] with cares and riches and pleasures of
[1:32:46] this life and bring forth no fruit to
[1:32:50] protect Perfection but that on the good
[1:32:52] ground are they which in an honest and
[1:32:54] good heart having heard the word keep
[1:32:58] it and bring forth fruit with patience
[1:33:02] Hebrews 6 verse1 say therefore leaving
[1:33:04] the principles the
[1:33:07] Cornerstone where we got to leave that
[1:33:09] corner part of that
[1:33:10] building you can go outside and say I'm
[1:33:12] going to build me a house Lay Your
[1:33:15] Foundation move
[1:33:18] in yeah brother John we're going to get
[1:33:21] couch and the bedroom's right over there
[1:33:22] so just go and put the over there well
[1:33:25] man you don't even have a house I got it
[1:33:27] all no you ain't you just starting to
[1:33:32] build therefore leaving the principles
[1:33:35] the Cornerstone of the doctrine of
[1:33:37] Christ now listen that's not leaving it
[1:33:39] and saying we don't need it no more
[1:33:41] that's building on
[1:33:43] itall let us go on unto Perfection
[1:33:46] headstone son of man are the finisher
[1:33:50] listen folks this is the finisher of it
[1:33:52] all
[1:33:53] now listen when we leave out of here
[1:33:55] there will be a message that goes to two
[1:33:59] witnesses that goes to 144,000 but
[1:34:02] Gentiles the people you rub shoulders
[1:34:04] with the people you do business with the
[1:34:06] people that you talk to if they're not
[1:34:09] bride they're Canon
[1:34:11] fodder and when that Gentile age is over
[1:34:13] the bombs are going to
[1:34:17] fall so this is the finisher yes sir for
[1:34:22] me and you this is it there's nothing
[1:34:25] else coming that'll make you
[1:34:28] different I said this coming it's
[1:34:30] already here this should make us
[1:34:32] different right so that word means
[1:34:35] Perfection means a
[1:34:37] perfector one who has in his own person
[1:34:40] raised Faith to its Perfection do you
[1:34:44] really believe this message is right
[1:34:47] then we must do what it says on the
[1:34:48] books and the tapes
[1:34:51] that's and so set before us the highest
[1:34:55] example of faith and that's another
[1:34:57] thing I was going to cover brother R
[1:34:59] said we we sin every day now remember
[1:35:01] what is
[1:35:03] sin
[1:35:05] unbelief so we unbelieve every day don't
[1:35:08] tell me you do oh no I believe
[1:35:10] everything everything
[1:35:12] perfect well let's go back to the liar
[1:35:16] part you lied so you sined okay preach
[1:35:20] Regina I believe we will
[1:35:26] but our highest example of faith is in
[1:35:28] the word of
[1:35:29] God now it says example so that's us the
[1:35:33] highest example is the word of God if we
[1:35:36] have faith in the word of God we should
[1:35:38] be able to do what it
[1:35:40] says I know we fail miserably but let's
[1:35:43] at least
[1:35:45] try not laying again the foundation now
[1:35:48] what is what is Paul telling us we're
[1:35:50] not God's not going backwards
[1:35:53] amen he sent us a message he sent us a
[1:35:56] I'm sorry he sent us a prophet with a
[1:35:59] message to deliver to a fivefold
[1:36:02] Ministry to deliver to the leoty for us
[1:36:05] to be raptured
[1:36:07] with changed and raptured with that's
[1:36:11] what it is in a
[1:36:13] nutshell not laying again the foundation
[1:36:15] of repentance from dead Works other
[1:36:17] words don't go
[1:36:18] backwards and a faith toward
[1:36:21] god of the doctrine of baptism and
[1:36:24] laying on of hands and resurrection of
[1:36:25] the dead and eternal judgment this we
[1:36:28] will do if God
[1:36:31] permit you know there was Jun was
[1:36:33] listening or watching somebody online
[1:36:35] the other day makes a good
[1:36:40] point everybody

[1:36:45] it's

[1:37:04] forgive us we put it under the blood
[1:37:06] remember he said don't drag it back out

[1:37:13] question I'm going be real serious with
[1:37:15] you when you come up here and testify of

[1:37:33] more why don't we testify testify about

[1:37:43] up here and when I tell y'all okay I say
[1:37:46] look we had a BC we had a before Christ
[1:37:48] life okay we did the things of the world
[1:37:51] but I'm not giving you names places and
[1:37:53] the things I did cuz I put that under
[1:37:56] the blood we have put that under the
[1:37:58] blood yes we got before God and we put
[1:38:01] everything we had before God and between
[1:38:03] me and you and everything we did and all
[1:38:06] that before we did what you know got
[1:38:07] married before we when we started
[1:38:10] getting when we got born again I did
[1:38:11] before she did but we started getting
[1:38:13] things right start off right but listen
[1:38:16] God forbid let me tell you something
[1:38:18] don't you ever bring your past life up
[1:38:20] to your wife or husband when you're mad
[1:38:21] at them yeah
[1:38:23] don't get don't get quiet on me you've
[1:38:25] never done that before I'm sorry I'm in
[1:38:26] the wrong I'm in the wrong
[1:38:31] group when I said that Susan lean this
[1:38:33] way away from
[1:38:40] Donnie truth hurts but it's the truth
[1:38:43] let's don't drag these things back
[1:38:45] out you're the you're the problem then
[1:38:48] that's right you are not somebody you
[1:38:51] mad at you're the problem you've drug it
[1:38:53] back out from under the blood let's
[1:38:55] don't do that anymore let's testify of
[1:38:57] great things that God's done yes that's
[1:39:00] right amen I'm not testifying about my
[1:39:03] past it's gone prise the
[1:39:06] Lord let's don't go fishing right and
[1:39:10] that sea so that's just a little pointer
[1:39:12] that um that June was sharing with me
[1:39:14] that she had heard and it's true and the
[1:39:16] minister say why do we drag those things
[1:39:18] out why do we bring them back even in
[1:39:20] conversation why do we and I do and I've
[1:39:22] done it you know I had a beer over here
[1:39:24] I had a this over there let's don't
[1:39:26] bring that up no more that to to God
[1:39:28] that never
[1:39:29] happened so let's just keep it over
[1:39:32] there of the doctrine of baptism laying
[1:39:35] on of hands resurrection of the dead and
[1:39:36] eternal judgment this we would do if God
[1:39:39] permit now
[1:39:42] remember real simple when you say he's
[1:39:45] the Chief Cornerstone that's what the
[1:39:47] Bible calls him right
[1:39:50] precious they stumble at The Stumbling
[1:39:53] on who Christ they stumble at Christ
[1:39:55] listen they stumble at you right why do
[1:39:58] you go to church all the time why do you
[1:40:00] have to wear your dresses like you do
[1:40:01] why do you why do you man not have a
[1:40:03] beer on the afternoon when you have you
[1:40:05] know hard work and you I want
[1:40:08] one that's what you do that's what you
[1:40:11] want to say brother John you want to say
[1:40:13] that's what you do that's not what I do
[1:40:16] I don't do that no more so the
[1:40:18] Cornerstone the church Ages was partial
[1:40:22] understanding even in the first first
[1:40:23] because even Paul said I look through a
[1:40:25] glass
[1:40:26] Darkly Paul said I don't see all things
[1:40:29] but I see
[1:40:31] Jesus Paul didn't know anything about
[1:40:33] the
[1:40:34] seals Paul knew about good living Paul
[1:40:36] knew about all those things but he
[1:40:37] didn't know about that seals was going
[1:40:38] to change his body cuz he preached about
[1:40:40] it we which alive and remain he knew
[1:40:43] there was a revelation there but he knew
[1:40:45] he wasn't going to get to it you and I
[1:40:48] are going to fulfill that scripture amen
[1:40:50] but the headstone that we're getting to
[1:40:52] transition in to is the son of man
[1:40:55] revelation God back in human flesh again
[1:40:58] the
[1:40:59] Perfection tell me one one thing Jesus
[1:41:04] Christ did that was
[1:41:07] wrong now the Bible said he was perfect
[1:41:09] example the perfect
[1:41:12] example okay so now when we get him back
[1:41:15] on the scene in his
[1:41:18] fullness there'll be a perfect church
[1:41:21] right all right is everybody with me
[1:41:24] now look down Through the Ages we had
[1:41:25] reformers not prophets reformers and
[1:41:28] each office carries US own work not
[1:41:30] denying reformers but that's what we
[1:41:32] don't need somebody to reform
[1:41:34] us cuz if you get reformed you'll go do
[1:41:37] it
[1:41:38] again right but when the real thing is
[1:41:40] to be revealed at the last day of the
[1:41:43] last part of the church is when God has
[1:41:46] said that he would send us according to
[1:41:48] the scriptures and we've searched it
[1:41:50] through and through that he predicted
[1:41:52] that the spirit of alive Elijah would
[1:41:54] return in some
[1:41:57] person
[1:41:59] person but it'll be properly identified
[1:42:03] you know what Elijah was and watch that
[1:42:07] look the elect will know not the
[1:42:10] others they sure won't do it they'll
[1:42:13] miss it a million
[1:42:15] miles for
[1:42:18] seal look not under the revelation of
[1:42:20] the lon age or the first age the early
[1:42:22] church now look
[1:42:24] not though it was a great age though it
[1:42:26] was all great people not beling them at
[1:42:29] all they had their place but they were
[1:42:31] not required to come to Perfection like
[1:42:32] me and
[1:42:34] you the next age was the age of the ox
[1:42:37] which is the Dark Age the middle age it
[1:42:39] wasn't revealed as what it was nor the
[1:42:42] manlike Beast of wisdom Beast of wisdom
[1:42:46] representing the reformers Luther and
[1:42:48] Wesley and so forth it wasn't
[1:42:51] revealed but in the eagle
[1:42:53] age the last age the prophetic age not
[1:42:57] the L ofan age the prophetic age L to
[1:43:00] see is blind riched miserable naked I
[1:43:03] thought we'd been called out of
[1:43:06] that there is to rise prophetic
[1:43:10] utterance to whom the secrets always
[1:43:13] come so Malachi 4 we'll read the part
[1:43:17] that's pertinent to us and he'll turn
[1:43:19] the heart one heart not Hearts heart
[1:43:23] heart of the children to their fathers
[1:43:26] lest I come and smite the Earth with the
[1:43:28] curse you know Israel believes they they
[1:43:30] are looking for Elijah that's why when
[1:43:33] Elijah steps over there with Moses
[1:43:35] they're like we have arrived CU every
[1:43:37] year they have their Sedar and they look
[1:43:39] they go outside and they look for Elijah
[1:43:41] cuz right here in Malachi 4 their
[1:43:44] Prophet
[1:43:45] Malachi they say speaking to them that
[1:43:49] before the great and Dreadful day of the
[1:43:50] Lord are Smite the Earth with a curse
[1:43:51] I'm going to send you an a
[1:43:54] so that's who they're looking for and
[1:43:55] that's what they're going to get the
[1:43:56] spirit of Elijah on somebody and I
[1:43:58] believe they're both over there right
[1:44:00] now that's how close we
[1:44:03] are so William brandham took Pentecostal
[1:44:05] babies to maturity he
[1:44:09] tried he tried his whole message from 47
[1:44:11] to 63 but when he got up to 62 and 63
[1:44:14] spoke the words Ral seed he'd say things
[1:44:16] like I'm going to lose a th000 friends
[1:44:19] um marriage and divorce I'm going to
[1:44:21] lose 100,000 friends and he did
[1:44:24] he lost a lot of people when he started
[1:44:25] bringing his message listen Jesus lost a
[1:44:28] lot of people when he started saying I
[1:44:30] am my father are
[1:44:34] one God bless whoever that
[1:44:37] is wreck or
[1:44:40] whatever but Jesus stood one day and he
[1:44:44] said I am of my
[1:44:46] father and you are of yours
[1:44:50] yes they knew what he was saying
[1:44:54] cuz they said you being a man make
[1:44:57] yourself
[1:44:58] God no like I said before it was God
[1:45:01] showing himself that he was a
[1:45:03] man they just couldn't see it so that's
[1:45:06] the same way with us so he took
[1:45:08] Pentecostal bab to maturity now that
[1:45:10] wasn't I always go back to that and and
[1:45:13] you may not you may not agree but I
[1:45:15] always go back to me it's a hinge point
[1:45:18] in his
[1:45:19] ministry when he preaches the seals he
[1:45:21] preaches all of them but but and
[1:45:23] preaches to number six and then he has
[1:45:25] questions and answers all right to me
[1:45:29] this is what brother brandham is telling
[1:45:31] hisself they're not getting
[1:45:34] it that's what he said remember right
[1:45:37] before he on questions and answers he
[1:45:38] said you're not getting this he said
[1:45:41] it's not even for you I'll read it later
[1:45:44] on in when we get into the seal he said
[1:45:46] it's not even for you congregation
[1:45:48] hundreds of people 300 people he say
[1:45:51] it's not even for you he said just live
[1:45:53] a good simple Christian Life in other
[1:45:55] words you're going to pass
[1:45:57] away in other words you're not getting
[1:46:00] you you're getting the healing you're
[1:46:02] getting the god in my soul I'm a newborn
[1:46:06] I'm a newborn creature in Christ and all
[1:46:08] that you're getting that but you're not
[1:46:10] getting what you're supposed to be
[1:46:15] getting you and I were supposed to been
[1:46:18] sitting in that audience and he wouldn't
[1:46:19] have said that
[1:46:21] right oh don't don't get
[1:46:26] quiet or would you sit there today just
[1:46:28] like that it is when pre when he
[1:46:30] preaches oh no he's the
[1:46:33] prophet there's a difference between a
[1:46:35] gift of Prophecy and Prophet I already
[1:46:36] told you that so let's continue on now
[1:46:39] look you say all right well tell me
[1:46:41] since we are coming to the
[1:46:44] fullness what do we got to
[1:46:47] do because remember the Holy Ghost is
[1:46:52] perfect
[1:46:53] amen and he was sent to make you and I
[1:46:57] perfect
[1:46:59] right so brother B say look we need
[1:47:01] something to work on before the Holy
[1:47:03] Ghost can ever go to work he's got to
[1:47:06] have something to work with that's right
[1:47:09] that's why when a denomination
[1:47:11] denominates around as Methodist did
[1:47:13] sprinkling God left amen the Holy Ghost
[1:47:17] couldn't work under that false Doctrine
[1:47:20] okay so it moved over to the Baptist the
[1:47:21] Baptist says well we baptized but we
[1:47:23] believe there's a trinity Holy Ghost
[1:47:26] said okay that's fine I'll wink at that
[1:47:29] but I'm moving on I'm looking
[1:47:32] for somebody that wants to be
[1:47:38] perfect if we're not it
[1:47:41] folks then all y'all we go everyone in
[1:47:44] this 80 people is going to pass on and
[1:47:46] another group's coming I don't believe
[1:47:48] that I don't believe that no more I'm
[1:47:50] standing here somebody is going to catch
[1:47:53] this thing and let the Holy Ghost have
[1:47:56] something to work
[1:47:58] with you know that's right oh this phic
[1:48:01] age that we're living in I tell you I'll
[1:48:03] never let a seventh grade dummy tell me
[1:48:05] I came from so and so I got a college
[1:48:07] education but you haven't got gumption
[1:48:09] enough to know how to control it
[1:48:14] wow let's continue on so Revelation 3:14
[1:48:18] this is the the um announcement to the
[1:48:21] age until the Angel of the Church of the
[1:48:23] L of ss remember it tells you different
[1:48:25] than the other five the alpha bride is
[1:48:29] of and this bride is of if you reading
[1:48:30] your Bible these things sayth the amen
[1:48:33] the faithful and true witness now watch
[1:48:34] what is the beginning of the creation of
[1:48:39] God what is
[1:48:41] that is when Jesus was formed in the
[1:48:45] womb of
[1:48:47] Mary no sex creative act spoken word she
[1:48:51] agreed with the spoken word and God
[1:48:53] planted the seed and the
[1:48:57] egg that was the beginning so what is
[1:48:59] this telling us since we're over
[1:49:02] here why is it telling us over
[1:49:06] here he's telling me that that creation
[1:49:10] that begun 2,000 years ago is now right
[1:49:13] here amen and it's birthing a group of
[1:49:17] people that should have been birthed
[1:49:19] that way had there not been a fall
[1:49:21] that's right right we've come back to
[1:49:24] that we have actually come across the
[1:49:27] chasm Brother Richard Wilson said look
[1:49:29] Satan put us on this side or we did by
[1:49:30] our choice but God is trying to put us
[1:49:33] back into the right
[1:49:35] place so under this ministry of the end
[1:49:37] time it's telling us what in the world
[1:49:40] is the beginning of the creation of God
[1:49:42] it's you and
[1:49:43] me and it's us in Perfection
[1:49:47] yes let's don't read all that
[1:49:53] let's continue on here look the amen is
[1:49:55] the last this is Brother R's commentary
[1:49:58] he's appeared all the way down through
[1:50:00] and different things but here's the last
[1:50:02] Church age this is the finish I am the
[1:50:06] last now to show that he was the first
[1:50:09] also as he was he's the beginning of the
[1:50:13] creation of God back over here do you
[1:50:16] catch it how could God be created if
[1:50:19] he's a
[1:50:20] spirit how could he be he's Eternal he
[1:50:24] never was created he never will be
[1:50:27] created because he was God at the
[1:50:29] beginning but he that is the beginning
[1:50:32] of the creation of God was Jesus Christ
[1:50:35] when he was made manifest when God lived
[1:50:38] in him he is God's creation oh my see
[1:50:42] the first and last the amen the
[1:50:43] beginning of the creation of God when
[1:50:45] God created himself a body he came down
[1:50:48] and lived in it that's the beginning of
[1:50:50] the creation of God oh isn't he
[1:50:53] wonderful so what do we what have we
[1:50:56] come back to we've come back to by the
[1:50:59] new birth that's you right yes you are
[1:51:03] now the beginning of the creation of God
[1:51:04] you so I yeah you still got this Old
[1:51:06] Shell but that was because of the
[1:51:10] fall but inside your
[1:51:13] soul God bire you without
[1:51:16] sex he birthed you by the word of God
[1:51:19] the way it should have been that Genesis
[1:51:20] one come on somebody that Genesis 126
[1:51:23] man is alive and well sitting here
[1:51:25] standing here today it's right here in
[1:51:27] you it's not with you listen genesis6 is
[1:51:30] not an
[1:51:32] anointing it's a person it's his bride
[1:51:36] it's his people it's me and you today
[1:51:39] it's not an anointing no Satan can give
[1:51:42] you an anointing but I promise you he
[1:51:43] can't give you that Genesis 13 and6 man
[1:51:45] that's
[1:51:46] right Genesis 126 man didn't come from
[1:51:49] God it is God
[1:51:53] everybody with
[1:51:54] me and I am the beginning of the
[1:51:57] creation of God through the church ages
[1:51:59] that were to have you learn that I am
[1:52:02] God now watch God created in a man form
[1:52:05] I'm the beginning of the creation of God
[1:52:07] now over here that would make a
[1:52:08] presbyterian shout just think of it
[1:52:10] beginning of the creation of God oh I
[1:52:12] like that oh I like that when God was
[1:52:15] created when God was made
[1:52:17] flesh in Jesus Christ and dwelt Among Us
[1:52:21] now remember John
[1:52:24] 1:14 and that word was made flesh and
[1:52:27] dwelt Among Us now I said before and I'm
[1:52:30] going to say it again that wasn't 2,000
[1:52:32] years ago that wasn't one moment but
[1:52:34] it's right here today the word today is
[1:52:37] made flesh when you get born again your
[1:52:39] word your flesh has become the word of
[1:52:41] God you say oh my flesh you can say what
[1:52:44] you want to you're not your Soul's not
[1:52:47] over there that's right your Soul's
[1:52:49] inside of you today
[1:52:52] am so now the transition to Perfection
[1:52:55] has begun give me about 15 more
[1:52:57] minutes birth pains now
[1:53:00] watch now notice each age Rock the
[1:53:03] church and give it birth pains now
[1:53:07] listen no other age Jesus said you're
[1:53:10] lukewarm cold and
[1:53:14] Powerless he said you got this to do I'm
[1:53:16] going to give you this I'm going give
[1:53:17] you this star I'm going to give you this
[1:53:18] I'm going to give you these things
[1:53:19] you're going to do these things you're
[1:53:20] going to be a pillar all right age blind
[1:53:24] wretched miserable naked and don't know
[1:53:25] it all right so but every age had a
[1:53:29] power it had an anointing to bring us so
[1:53:32] that you and I could stand today and
[1:53:34] look back at that
[1:53:37] anointing of Luther Wesley different
[1:53:39] ones now watch after the birth Pains
[1:53:42] come instead of going on with the word
[1:53:45] they got a bunch of men together just
[1:53:48] like the first one did back in the first
[1:53:51] age right
[1:53:53] it's exactly right after the rocking of
[1:53:56] the apostles then we find her going off
[1:53:59] again then we find out Along come many
[1:54:01] of the others agabus and many of the
[1:54:03] Great reformers came back in the
[1:54:05] beginning each age had done as you study
[1:54:08] the preia council the Nia fathers and
[1:54:11] all back you find it all in there each
[1:54:14] age was rocked every time a messenger
[1:54:17] come forth would thus sayith the
[1:54:20] Lord now she's in in the worst
[1:54:24] age according to the scripture that
[1:54:26] she's ever
[1:54:27] been we are in the Lan age a rich But
[1:54:30] Blind Church AIDs that don't know
[1:54:33] it listen Christianity has been so
[1:54:37] diluted you go tell somebody they're not
[1:54:40] a Christian
[1:54:42] today you go tell somebody they don't
[1:54:44] act like a Christian today and you'll
[1:54:46] probably find out there's still a little
[1:54:48] bit of U um fight left in
[1:54:53] them you can't tell people that you
[1:54:57] can't tell and like I said before they
[1:54:59] they diluted hell hell ain't hell ain't
[1:55:02] nothing
[1:55:04] anymore the devil's a kind guy he's
[1:55:07] good no he's never he listen he's a
[1:55:11] destroyer always has been always will be
[1:55:15] God's Eternal always has been always
[1:55:17] will be now there wasn't nowhere in the
[1:55:20] Bible that Christ was ever put out of
[1:55:22] the church church but the lay out of sin
[1:55:23] age she's in the worst age she's the
[1:55:26] rottenest she ever was said I said as a
[1:55:30] queen having need of nothing and don't
[1:55:32] you know that you're naked miserable
[1:55:33] blind poor and don't know it yes sir I
[1:55:36] counsel thee come by isav from me we
[1:55:40] know where that isav is it's this
[1:55:42] message of the
[1:55:44] hour that it might open your eyes and
[1:55:47] it'll certainly the isav of God will
[1:55:49] certainly bring light to the church if
[1:55:52] it wants to open its eyes to what God
[1:55:55] has
[1:55:56] said notice quickly now now she's in
[1:56:00] that stage beyond a shadow of a doubt
[1:56:01] we're in the L of in church age now her
[1:56:04] messenger is promised now watch in
[1:56:06] Malachi the 4th chapter he's promised to
[1:56:08] do it and the message is to bring back
[1:56:13] the word all right birth is to be she's
[1:56:18] to be delivered of a new birth from a
[1:56:21] cour
[1:56:22] to Malachi 4 now some of you might have
[1:56:25] got born again out in the other Church
[1:56:27] ages out the other churches I'm talking
[1:56:29] about denominations and I can go with
[1:56:31] that you it's up to
[1:56:33] you but hearing the truth of this word
[1:56:36] of God that's what bir
[1:56:41] me that's what got my attention this
[1:56:46] messag so there's a now look she be
[1:56:49] delivered of a new birth not a different
[1:56:51] birth
[1:56:53] no it's not different you still got to
[1:56:54] go through justification satification
[1:56:56] but we know those stages now we know
[1:56:58] what to do you you should know sitting
[1:57:01] here today whether you're born again or
[1:57:07] not she used to be delivered of a new
[1:57:10] birth from According to Malachi 4 in the
[1:57:14] church world today there's two systems
[1:57:16] working now listen real close now I want
[1:57:18] you to see if you're going to say Amen
[1:57:19] on this there's two systems working in
[1:57:23] the church world today I'm going to get
[1:57:25] this off my shoulder and then I have it
[1:57:27] over with we all know that that's the
[1:57:30] word of God and the denomination system
[1:57:33] two systems denomination word of God
[1:57:36] Amen there's the two systems that work
[1:57:39] just as they were Jacob and Esau one
[1:57:41] after the spirit one after the Flesh and
[1:57:44] what was it Esau and Jacob were fighting
[1:57:46] in the womb of the mother even to the
[1:57:49] time they were born and so is the
[1:57:51] denomination aals and the word fighting
[1:57:54] one against the other they have been
[1:57:57] since Luther first brought the First
[1:57:59] Reformation I hope that's simple enough
[1:58:02] that you can understand it and I
[1:58:04] highlighted
[1:58:05] that now
[1:58:07] watch these
[1:58:09] men he's talking about preachers or
[1:58:13] ministers these men if they pick up this
[1:58:16] now you see how that word this is
[1:58:19] capitalized that means this message
[1:58:21] right it wasn't just a
[1:58:23] this if they pick up this and goes out
[1:58:27] with it they can make more sense to it
[1:58:30] see to bring it to a place you would I
[1:58:34] just want to lay this seed then hoping
[1:58:36] they make it come to
[1:58:40] life a group of
[1:58:43] people that's going to be a
[1:58:46] voice of the messenger in the final
[1:58:49] age but in the days of the voice of the
[1:58:51] seventh Angel when he shall begin to
[1:58:53] sound a mystery one mystery of God
[1:58:55] should be finished as Heath declared to
[1:58:57] his servants the prophets there it is
[1:59:00] brother Brown said he's sending a
[1:59:02] Vindicated prophet he is sending a
[1:59:04] prophet after almost 2,000 years Paul he
[1:59:08] is sending someone who is so far from
[1:59:11] organization education and the world of
[1:59:14] religion that as John the Baptist and
[1:59:16] Elijah of old he will hear only from God
[1:59:23] right and have thus sayith the Lord look
[1:59:28] and speak for
[1:59:32] God do you believe that you believe
[1:59:35] we've heard the voice of God in the end
[1:59:37] time I do and he's speaking to me he's
[1:59:40] not speaking to
[1:59:42] you he will be God's mouthpiece and has
[1:59:46] he as it is declared in Malachi
[1:59:48] 46 will turn the hearts of the children
[1:59:51] back to to the fathers he will bring
[1:59:53] back the elect of the last day they will
[1:59:57] hear a Vindicated Prophet give the exact
[2:00:00] truth as it was with
[2:00:03] Paul he will restore the truth as they
[2:00:06] had
[2:00:07] it and those elect with him in that day
[2:00:11] will be the ones who truly manifest the
[2:00:15] Lord and be his body and be his
[2:00:20] voice and perform
[2:00:23] Capital H so it's not brother brandham
[2:00:25] that's God perform his Works Hallelujah
[2:00:28] do you see it let's continue on it's
[2:00:31] just before Christ comes the second time
[2:00:34] by the time Jesus comes look by the time
[2:00:36] Jesus comes all scripture must be
[2:00:39] fulfilled the Gentile dispensation will
[2:00:42] be in its last Church age when that
[2:00:44] messenger of Malachi
[2:00:46] comes he will be right with the word he
[2:00:49] will take the whole Bible from Genesis
[2:00:52] Revelations now we believe that God did
[2:00:53] that right through a prophet right he
[2:00:56] will start at the serpent seed and Carry
[2:00:59] On To The Messer in the latter rign but
[2:01:02] he will be rejected by the
[2:01:06] denominations he has to be for that is
[2:01:08] history repeating itself from the time
[2:01:10] of Ahab Israel's history under Ahab is
[2:01:14] happening right here in America where
[2:01:16] the prophet of Malachi
[2:01:19] appears he's telling you where he's at
[2:01:23] in America where this Prophet amalaki
[2:01:25] for
[2:01:27] appears as Israel left Egypt to Worship
[2:01:29] in Freedom pushed out the natives raed
[2:01:32] raised up a nation with great leaders
[2:01:34] like David Etc then put an Ahab on the
[2:01:36] throne with a jezebel behind him to
[2:01:38] direct so have we done the very same
[2:01:42] thing in America our forefathers left
[2:01:45] for this land to worship and live in
[2:01:47] Freedom they pushed back the natives and
[2:01:49] took over the land mighty men like
[2:01:51] Washington and Lincoln were raised up
[2:01:53] but after a while other men of such poor
[2:01:57] caliber succeeded these worthy men that
[2:02:00] soon as Ahab was set in the presidential
[2:02:03] chair you know what he's talking about
[2:02:05] right John F Kennedy and
[2:02:09] Jezebel was whatever what was her name
[2:02:13] Jackie
[2:02:16] Jackie that's who he's talking about if
[2:02:18] y'all didn't know
[2:02:19] that and the presidential chair was a
[2:02:21] Jezebel behind him to direct him is at
[2:02:24] such a time as this that the messenger
[2:02:26] of Malachi 4 must come then in the
[2:02:29] latter rain will come in Mount Carmel
[2:02:33] Showdown now what's the latter rain
[2:02:35] Harvest rain stick with me just for a
[2:02:37] minute now look watch this carefully now
[2:02:41] to see it in the word John was the
[2:02:43] Forerunner of Malachi
[2:02:45] 3 he planted the former rain and was
[2:02:49] rejected by the organization of his
[2:02:51] death day everybody with me remember
[2:02:54] he's Elijah number three brother Brown
[2:02:57] was number four one coming is number
[2:02:59] five all right first two was Elijah and
[2:03:01] Elisha he planted the former rain now
[2:03:04] watch the former rain that's when you
[2:03:06] plant you plant have a rain on it brings
[2:03:08] a crop up latter rain is the last rain
[2:03:10] you get before you harvest it because it
[2:03:12] pops everything out all right that's
[2:03:14] what we're under now he planted the
[2:03:16] former rain and was rejected by the
[2:03:18] organization of his day Jesus came and
[2:03:22] had a mount Transfiguration Showdown the
[2:03:25] second Forerunner of Christ will
[2:03:27] sow for the latter rain the second
[2:03:30] Forerunner that's him that's brother
[2:03:33] brandham remember he was on the river
[2:03:35] down there Ohio River and the and the
[2:03:38] angel come and said as John the Baptist
[2:03:40] came to forrun the first coming of
[2:03:41] Christ your message will forrun the
[2:03:42] second coming of Christ remember what
[2:03:44] the angel said he didn't say
[2:03:47] you he said your
[2:03:49] message it's all in the message we know
[2:03:52] they're the
[2:03:53] same but brother random can make a
[2:03:55] mistake as human
[2:03:57] being the word
[2:03:59] can't and we know that we know that he
[2:04:01] didn't but I'm just telling you we if
[2:04:04] people looked at the man and when he
[2:04:06] died they
[2:04:08] died their Revelation died when he died
[2:04:11] let's don't do that that's not God God
[2:04:12] doesn't want it that
[2:04:15] way the second Forerunner of Christ will
[2:04:17] s for the latter Reign Jesus will be the
[2:04:20] showdown between the den nominations and
[2:04:22] Creeds for he will come to back up his
[2:04:24] word and take his bride in the Rapture
[2:04:26] he's talking about right now this day
[2:04:28] that we're living in Jesus Will Be The
[2:04:30] Showdown what the son of man will be
[2:04:33] back in power and a group of people
[2:04:35] called a
[2:04:36] bride for he will come to back up his
[2:04:39] word and take his bride in the Rapture
[2:04:41] the first Showdown was Mount Carmel
[2:04:43] Elijah the second was Mount
[2:04:45] Transfiguration Jesus and the third will
[2:04:47] be Mount Zion now where is Zion Zion's
[2:04:50] in heaven and we are the daughters of
[2:04:52] Zion this message will be to take us to
[2:04:55] Mount Zion there'll be a showdown you
[2:04:57] know what it's going to be the day you
[2:04:58] get your body changed will be The
[2:05:00] Showdown the day your body is changed
[2:05:03] right here on this Earth and all this
[2:05:05] sin and everything still going on
[2:05:07] that'll be The Showdown that will take
[2:05:09] Satan and show him where he's at you're
[2:05:13] nothing
[2:05:16] right now he promised in the last days
[2:05:18] what he would
[2:05:19] do and it sent them up us the message
[2:05:23] and this message would have the same
[2:05:24] identification as Elijah had as Elisha
[2:05:28] had as John the Baptist and it would
[2:05:30] turn the hearts of the people not to the
[2:05:32] denomination but back to the original
[2:05:34] Apostolic fathers back to the word how
[2:05:38] these things have been Vindicated how
[2:05:39] that in the sounding of the last Angel
[2:05:41] Revelations 10 days of the seventh angel
[2:05:43] these
[2:05:44] Mysteries why did the methodists do this
[2:05:47] and the Baptist Church of Christ Jehovah
[2:05:49] Witness do all that in other words what
[2:05:50] he's saying he's telling these people
[2:05:51] people the Baptist did this what he was
[2:05:55] telling was he said look Baptist you're
[2:05:56] good but you're wrong here matus you're
[2:05:58] good but you're wrong here Nazarene
[2:05:59] you're good but you're wrong here
[2:06:00] Pentecostals you're good but you're
[2:06:01] wrong
[2:06:02] here now look them Mysteries will be
[2:06:06] revealed in the last day now last day
[2:06:08] we're in the last
[2:06:09] day when the seventh Angels message not
[2:06:13] when he starts out doing this now here's
[2:06:17] where we're going to separate it and and
[2:06:19] this is where we'll begin next time a
[2:06:21] preach cuz remember brother ry's
[2:06:23] Ministry had what two
[2:06:25] parts all right there was a part over
[2:06:27] here there was a part over here all
[2:06:30] right that's what he's saying right here
[2:06:31] all right pay attention we'll be done
[2:06:33] just a
[2:06:34] second now when he start not when he
[2:06:36] starts out doing this in other words not
[2:06:38] when he starts out preaching but when he
[2:06:41] begins to sound his
[2:06:44] message not the years in
[2:06:48] preparation okay amen but when he begins
[2:06:52] to
[2:06:53] sound this way I'm going to say it the
[2:06:55] message right listen and and pay
[2:07:00] attention to what I'm saying to the very
[2:07:01] end all brother random did from 47 to 63
[2:07:04] was bring us back to where Paul and him
[2:07:06] were right and where did they go they
[2:07:09] died they went by the grave they're
[2:07:12] waiting on us hello
[2:07:14] somebody all right that's what happened
[2:07:17] so there's got to be a second message
[2:07:19] come a prophetic message to a group of
[2:07:22] people that wasn't even there yet to
[2:07:25] carry this thing on not the years in
[2:07:27] preparation but when he begins to sound
[2:07:30] the message these Mysteries then will be
[2:07:33] revealed and here they are not knowing
[2:07:36] them and you people are a witness of
[2:07:39] that Paradox
[2:07:41] 1965 healing is the children's bread we
[2:07:44] realize that it's in the atonement and
[2:07:46] the atonement first is applied to our
[2:07:48] soul we got to look at that
[2:07:51] amen healing is in lay on of hands all
[2:07:54] that's in the Bible but the healing of
[2:07:56] the soul is first
[2:07:58] right are the most important and healing
[2:08:02] has always forerun now watch this
[2:08:05] healing has always forerun every
[2:08:10] message all right and it's also been a
[2:08:13] means to gather people
[2:08:17] together many people will sponsor a
[2:08:19] healing meeting many will come to a
[2:08:21] healing meeting or to a song festival or
[2:08:23] a football game or when it comes to a
[2:08:26] poor lost soul to get saved there's not
[2:08:28] many people interested in
[2:08:30] that but that's the main thing Divine
[2:08:33] Healing and singing festivals and so
[2:08:35] forth as brother Bosworth used to say
[2:08:38] it's the bait on the hook now the bait
[2:08:40] doesn't catch the fish the hook does but
[2:08:43] the bait brings the fish close enough to
[2:08:45] take the bait and he gets the hook
[2:08:48] that's what he was trying they were
[2:08:49] trying to do when brother Brown was was
[2:08:51] trying he was he doing the healing
[2:08:53] campaigns he was trying to get him to
[2:08:54] see Jesus Christ they were just looking
[2:08:56] at brother
[2:08:57] Brandon and that's just the thing to get
[2:09:00] the people to listen a while till you
[2:09:02] can
[2:09:03] really present to them your
[2:09:07] message God has did that in every age
[2:09:10] through every age there's always been a
[2:09:12] healing campaign now watch here's the
[2:09:14] point I want to make right here and if
[2:09:16] it's a genuine healing campaign remember
[2:09:19] there's thousands of people impersonator
[2:09:22] impersonators a and all the different
[2:09:23] ones they weren't impersonators but they
[2:09:25] just had a healing message they had no
[2:09:27] message behind
[2:09:29] it and if it's a genuine healing
[2:09:32] campaign behind that campaign always is
[2:09:36] a
[2:09:37] message there never is a sign given just
[2:09:41] for a sign it's
[2:09:43] forerunning a message and I believe the
[2:09:46] same thing is 17 years ago 18 years ago
[2:09:48] that the Lord sent me out to start
[2:09:50] praying for the sick it made a great re
[2:09:52] Revival among the people many great
[2:09:54] Servants of God has went forth in a
[2:09:56] healing campaign uh but the healing
[2:09:58] campaign in
[2:09:59] itself if you'll stay in that same old
[2:10:02] trend of what you've always was there's
[2:10:05] something
[2:10:06] wrong listen folks we had a
[2:10:10] message we love you know what we love to
[2:10:13] hear the prayer lines a stimulation of
[2:10:16] of of sorry feelings
[2:10:22] I want to get what he said at
[2:10:26] first there's something wrong that
[2:10:29] healing campaign wasn't sent from
[2:10:34] God we still believe brother Brown was a
[2:10:36] prophet right
[2:10:38] okay that healing campaign wasn't sent
[2:10:41] from God it's got to attract attention
[2:10:44] first see get the attention and then
[2:10:47] there's a message Jesus when he went
[2:10:50] forth Healing The Sick he was a great
[2:10:52] prophet to all of them but when he began
[2:10:54] to tell them the truth of the Gospel who
[2:10:56] he was and what he came for then he was
[2:10:59] not popular after that and that's the
[2:11:02] way it's always been through every age
[2:11:04] it will continue that
[2:11:07] way anointing once at the end time when
[2:11:09] that church age is done denominated and
[2:11:11] become a church age when it's done in
[2:11:13] its Pentecostal organization when the
[2:11:16] messenger to that what was each
[2:11:18] messenger what was Martin Luther a
[2:11:20] rebuke to the Catholic what was Wesley a
[2:11:22] rebuke to the lutherans what was the
[2:11:24] Pentecostals a rebuke to rebuke to both
[2:11:26] of them where has the life gone now away
[2:11:28] from an organization no more Shu it's
[2:11:31] the grain what is it a rebuke to the
[2:11:33] Pentecostal seed to fulfill the
[2:11:35] scripture of this hour notice the very
[2:11:37] day when this messenger not when he
[2:11:40] starts
[2:11:43] on not the first part listen folks real
[2:11:49] quick real quick
[2:11:53] just a regular born again
[2:11:57] Christian will do what the Bible
[2:12:03] say so brother Bown didn't tell us how
[2:12:06] to be how how to be a different type of
[2:12:08] Christian they all preached Jesus Christ
[2:12:12] they all preached you had to be saved
[2:12:14] they all preached you had to be filled
[2:12:15] with the Holy Ghost but but but the
[2:12:17] Baptist say shake a hand fill out a
[2:12:19] letter method said well you just had a
[2:12:22] feeling this and said this over here
[2:12:24] this and said you got to speak in
[2:12:27] tongues okay that's the man anointing
[2:12:31] that's going to get you somewhere yeah
[2:12:32] it's going to make you a Christian but
[2:12:33] it's not going to get you out of here
[2:12:36] right not when he starts on but when he
[2:12:39] begins to declare his message yes see
[2:12:43] the first pull healing second pull
[2:12:46] prophesying third pull the opening of
[2:12:48] the word the Mysteries reveal we'll get
[2:12:50] into this a little bit later no more
[2:12:52] there's no more higher order to reveal
[2:12:54] the word than prophets but the only way
[2:12:57] the prophet can be Vindicated is by the
[2:13:00] word and remember the third pull was the
[2:13:02] opening of those Seven Seals to reveal
[2:13:05] the hidden truth that's been sealed in
[2:13:07] the
[2:13:13] word now this messenger of Malachi 4 and
[2:13:16] Revelations 10:7 is going to do two
[2:13:18] things just what I've been telling you
[2:13:19] we'll close right here one one according
[2:13:22] to Mali 4 he will turn the hearts of the
[2:13:24] children to the fathers
[2:13:26] what
[2:13:28] babies to
[2:13:31] maturity two he will reveal the
[2:13:34] mysteries of the seven Thunders nobody's
[2:13:35] ever done that before Jesus preached
[2:13:38] them but nobody's ever done it so they
[2:13:40] had to make they had to make sure that
[2:13:41] the son of man was back in the end time
[2:13:44] with no seals
[2:13:45] open two he will reveal the mysteries of
[2:13:48] the seven thunders in Revelations 10
[2:13:49] we'll get into that a little bit later
[2:13:51] which are the revelations contained in
[2:13:53] the Seven Seals when the book opened it
[2:13:56] will be these divinely revealed mystery
[2:13:58] truths that literally turn the hearts of
[2:14:00] the children to the Pentecostal fathers
[2:14:02] exactly
[2:14:05] so musicians come on y'all stand to your
[2:14:09] feet Listen to This Promise Daniel 12:4
[2:14:13] now we know Daniel's a Jew but we're
[2:14:15] Jews
[2:14:16] spiritually amen but thou oh Daniel shut
[2:14:21] up the words and seal the
[2:14:23] book even to the time of the
[2:14:27] end and many shall run to and fro in
[2:14:30] knowledge boy what about it we've had so
[2:14:32] much knowledge shall increase Daniel
[2:14:35] 12:7 and I heard the man clothed in
[2:14:37] linen which was upon the waters of the
[2:14:40] river when he held his right hand and
[2:14:42] his left hand to heaven and swear by him
[2:14:43] that liveth forever that it shall be a
[2:14:45] time times and a half and we know that's
[2:14:47] to the Jews that's a three and a half
[2:14:48] year Ministry to the Jews but Daniel
[2:14:51] didn't know that but we do and swear by
[2:14:54] him that liveth forever it shall be for
[2:14:55] a Time 1 time 2 that's three and a half
[2:14:59] so three and a half year Ministry and
[2:15:01] when he shall have accomplished to
[2:15:03] scatter the power of the Holy people all
[2:15:05] these things shall be
[2:15:06] finished and I heard but I understood
[2:15:11] not now there's Daniel Daniel was a
[2:15:14] prophet right he was a Jew but he was a
[2:15:17] prophet brother BR called him a prophet
[2:15:19] listen The Book of Daniel is the Book of
[2:15:20] Revelation to the Jews if you didn't
[2:15:22] know that read it the Book of Daniel is
[2:15:25] the Book of Revelations that we have
[2:15:26] over here this is for the Gentiles and
[2:15:28] the Book of Daniel is for what's going
[2:15:30] to happen during the Jew Jewish time
[2:15:31] time time and dividing of times and I
[2:15:33] heard but I understood not then said I
[2:15:36] oh my
[2:15:38] Lord what shall be the end of these
[2:15:42] things and God said go thy Way Daniel
[2:15:45] for the words are closed up and sealed
[2:15:48] till the time of the end
[2:15:52] Daniel was a great man
[2:15:55] right he'll be there Paul was a great
[2:15:59] man he'll be there Luther was a great
[2:16:02] man he'll be there Wesley was a great
[2:16:03] man he'll be
[2:16:05] there but none of
[2:16:07] them preached in an open book not one of
[2:16:11] them went to the body
[2:16:13] change that's what we're looking for
[2:16:16] that's what brother brandham gave us
[2:16:18] this message not in the years of
[2:16:19] preparation not in the healing campaign
[2:16:22] not in the bait campaign the bait was to
[2:16:25] get them to listen but what the problem
[2:16:28] was they flip-flopped it you asked some
[2:16:31] of these brother George Canada said it
[2:16:33] himself and so did sister C they went to
[2:16:35] Jefferson
[2:16:40] bille to hear the prayer
[2:16:44] line they were so hooked on the prayer
[2:16:47] line they missed the message I don't say
[2:16:49] they missed the message went in sin they
[2:16:51] missed the they missed the time that
[2:16:53] should have been and that's what brother
[2:16:55] Brown said he said he said look he said
[2:16:57] you Pentecostal said you you've cabbaged
[2:16:59] down you've missed
[2:17:01] this this just a bait on the hook you
[2:17:03] should come to this message don't come
[2:17:05] listening for the healing
[2:17:08] campaign now you and
[2:17:10] I are under the greatest healing
[2:17:15] campaign that ever
[2:17:18] was all those people that got healed in
[2:17:20] brother the R's Ministry pretty much
[2:17:23] have all passed
[2:17:24] away healed of cancer cancers fall off
[2:17:27] in the floor uh a lady that weighed 75
[2:17:30] PBS became a a robust woman again just
[2:17:34] like that healing Miracles you'll never
[2:17:36] hear of before but they're all passed
[2:17:41] away they got their part of message of
[2:17:43] the healing campaign
[2:17:46] right but this last part of this message
[2:17:50] is the greatest healing campaign that's
[2:17:52] ever been right now you're under the
[2:17:54] greatest healing campaign that's ever
[2:17:56] hit the face of the Earth well wait I
[2:17:58] yeah me too my leg's killing me right
[2:18:00] now so
[2:18:03] what your body is going to get healed
[2:18:05] because your soul is going to come out
[2:18:07] and change that thing not come out but
[2:18:09] work its way out and that's the greatest
[2:18:12] healing that's ever been because
[2:18:13] remember the healing of your soul is
[2:18:16] eternal but when your body gets changed
[2:18:18] it's going to be changed into something
[2:18:19] temporary no it's going to be changed
[2:18:21] into something
[2:18:22] Eternal and that's the second part of
[2:18:25] the message that brother Brandon brought
[2:18:27] was to take a bride from where they were
[2:18:30] and bring them into the most mature
[2:18:32] bride that's ever been the wife that's
[2:18:34] made herself ready and got a body
[2:18:37] changed cuz by Revelations 19 when that
[2:18:40] voice says his wife has made herself
[2:18:42] ready your body's been
[2:18:45] changed hello your body's been changed
[2:18:48] right there because we going to step
[2:18:49] right into the Millennium we don't have
[2:18:51] a body change
[2:18:55] here you want to sing a
[2:18:58] song yeah okay okay we'll do that you
[2:19:02] love the
[2:19:03] Lord we appreciate you I need to get
[2:19:05] this up I want you to pay attention to
[2:19:08] this message of the hour it's not just
[2:19:10] God sent a prophet it's not just that
[2:19:12] we're we're sitting here because we
[2:19:15] heard of William
[2:19:18] brandom and and I've seen it I've seen
[2:19:21] it I've seen it I remember I was a
[2:19:23] little kid when we first came into
[2:19:25] message but I've seen it and heard it
[2:19:28] most people in this message especially
[2:19:30] back then especially back
[2:19:32] then had the attitude that I got
[2:19:34] something you don't
[2:19:36] have come
[2:19:38] on some of you shaking your head some of
[2:19:41] you not yeah it is it's I've got this
[2:19:44] some secret thing and I got it but you
[2:19:47] don't have it but if you'll come over
[2:19:49] here and listen to me I'll tell it to
[2:19:51] you the only person that can give you a
[2:19:54] revelation of a mystery is Jesus
[2:19:57] Christ if it's anything else it's the
[2:20:00] devil just PL this
[2:20:04] day I got a revelation one day that I
[2:20:06] was
[2:20:08] lost that's the greatest Revelation I've
[2:20:10] up until this this moment that I'll ever
[2:20:14] have is that I was lost and I needed
[2:20:17] salvation I I didn't need a I didn't
[2:20:19] need a great father come on now I didn't
[2:20:22] need a great father that was a minister
[2:20:24] he can't save me my mama can't save me
[2:20:27] brother brandham can't save
[2:20:29] me Jesus Christ is the only thing can
[2:20:32] save
[2:20:33] you now if you're born again as we said
[2:20:36] before this messenger of Malachi 4 we're
[2:20:39] going to be birthed under that anointing
[2:20:40] of Malachi 4 we'll have a birth from
[2:20:43] According to Malachi 4 you and I are
[2:20:45] growing
[2:20:47] now under the Malachi 4 anointing
[2:20:52] okay cuz brother B's gone so it's the
[2:20:53] days of the
[2:20:55] voice but the days of the voice is going
[2:20:58] to produce a group of people listen if
[2:21:01] it stays a voice it's like I said you
[2:21:03] can say this message all you want to but
[2:21:06] if you live it different
[2:21:09] story Satan can quote listen Satan has
[2:21:12] already quoted every quote ever was in
[2:21:14] his
[2:21:17] message he's quoted the Bible
[2:21:20] the Bible says the Devils believe in one
[2:21:23] God and
[2:21:24] tremble so where are we
[2:21:27] at we're part of the mystery we'll get
[2:21:30] into that we're part of the mystery of
[2:21:32] the end time and we've got to be made
[2:21:34] known this world is going to see the
[2:21:37] culmination of William bram's message in
[2:21:40] a group of people I promise you it's
[2:21:42] thus sayth the lord it's it can't stay
[2:21:45] on paper it can't stay in quotes it
[2:21:49] can't stay on tape
[2:21:51] right it's got to come off of that and
[2:21:53] live inside of you to where you got to
[2:21:55] say that ain't nothing but the truth
[2:21:57] brother BR said the the the the the
[2:22:00] bride would have thus sayth the Lord are
[2:22:02] keep still you say oh well now that's
[2:22:04] only for a prophet I'm telling you what

[2:22:08] said you'll have thus sayith the Lord or
[2:22:10] you'll keep still and I believe we have
[2:22:12] thus sayith the Lord because if we say
[2:22:15] if we stay with the Bible it's thus
[2:22:17] sayith the Lord

[2:26:00] and I like to hear clapping it's a fast
[2:26:02] song and I know we're all tired but I
[2:26:06] don't think there's no reason to not
[2:26:08] praise God today because God's gone he's
[2:26:10] he's gone and done too many things in
[2:26:12] our lives in my life especially to not
[2:26:15] acknowledge Him for it and we're in the
[2:26:17] church that's where most people
[2:26:18] acknowledge Him right so I I think it's
[2:26:20] good that we go ahead and use our hands
[2:26:22] and the gifts that God gave us to praise
[2:26:23] him all right
[2:26:40] am a very big
