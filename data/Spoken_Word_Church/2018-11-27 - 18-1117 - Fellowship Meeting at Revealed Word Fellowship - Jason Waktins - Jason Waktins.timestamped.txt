[16:43] [Music]
[16:58] [Music]
[17:11] we press on
[17:14] like some of the works of song it made
[17:17] me think about Noah and one day you know
[17:20] what come on nowhere and he said he said
[17:24] it's gonna rain a lot of people gathered
[17:27] around that that's a some pretty
[17:28] fantastic and then after about six years
[17:32] well third of them left there's a good
[17:34] brain for this surgeon to make deals
[17:36] with Noah to do this stop popping Bo
[17:39] rein oh well that's a big church tax
[17:42] they increase it's gonna rain watch you
[17:45] know a lot of people started leaving it
[17:49] was a full-blown description pretty soon
[17:52] though the science began to be built in
[17:54] the art that there was no door so it's
[17:55] pretty much in and I would you wanted to
[17:59] are kept getting bills and the years
[18:01] kept going behind and people kept trying
[18:03] to get no one to stop preaching about
[18:05] rain but it didn't look right
[18:08] prophets message doesn't always look
[18:10] right near 65 there's hardly anybody
[18:20] left and then pretty soon someone had an
[18:22] idea about improve Noah's message so
[18:26] they began to bring up different
[18:28] versions of Noah's by boring
[18:30] different versions of Noah's message and
[18:33] they said no this of work we're going to
[18:34] get all the people to join up but just
[18:37] don't preach about the rain because it's
[18:39] it's embarrassing
[18:40] to preach about some little ol Kentucky
[18:42] exuded rain and all that all the reasons
[18:46] I wanna tell you today on this bright
[18:48] sunshiny day thus saith the Lord
[18:51] it's disappointing didn't know and not
[18:54] three so they're not disappointed
[18:56] they're angry at Noah remember the Holy
[19:00] Bible says as it was in the days of
[19:03] Moses were jettisoned jackers withstood
[19:06] the truth Moses was a prophet so wasn't
[19:09] that day a melody now begin to expect
[19:12] him so it being this last April Haley
[19:16] Bible says as in the days of Moses the
[19:20] Jackson generals were coming in to
[19:22] withstand the Moses of this state amen
[19:25] but Moses is missing the Bible says that
[19:28] God promised he would send you Elijah
[19:30] the prophet do it because he's promised
[19:35] by a prophecy he submit it's hard to be
[19:38] fairly for fear they are amen
[19:41] he promised that there'd be a great
[19:42] falling away before the that great day
[19:45] there is people have fallen all over it
[19:48] no matter what you want to believe
[19:50] there's a teacher teacher
[19:53] so here 19 don't you need to be older
[19:56] and he's preaching stronger than ever
[19:58] but the side to the Ark of getting built
[20:01] and the hinges and the doors are being
[20:02] put in now it's not so easy to get in
[20:05] and out and one day the door come up
[20:08] shut that door all I want to be in that
[20:13] secretes that passes all understanding

[20:42] work and they just didn't wanna listen
[20:44] to mark as they had better race then no
[20:48] Allah no one was old-fashioned and what
[20:50] he said this was wrong and false but the
[20:53] rains came shut the door Noah's family
[20:58] floated away from safety amen
[21:01] one day we're going to float out of this
[21:02] earth because this great artists right

[1:58:00] with me they said let's play may not
[1:58:02] keep a bernanke and I thought well
