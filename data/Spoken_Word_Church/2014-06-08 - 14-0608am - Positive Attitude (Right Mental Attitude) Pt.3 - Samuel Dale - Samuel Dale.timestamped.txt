[6:11] amen and amen
[6:13] I want to see him and good to see
[6:15] everybody in the house of the Lord if
[6:17] you'd like to turn in your scriptures
[6:19] turned to Romans
[6:22] the 10th chapter
[6:27] we really had a
[6:29] wonderful time last night at the Bible
[6:32] study at least I thought so and uh I
[6:36] pray that you'd enjoyed it and to you
[6:38] that want to hear it if you'll ask
[6:40] brother Joe he'll make you a copy of it
[6:42] because we always do copy those you know
[6:45] for you to listen to what we're talking
[6:46] about and we just kind of you know
[6:49] impersonal and we have got what is at
[6:52] verse 8. I believe that's right at verse
[6:55] 9 of Romans 1. we've had two two
[6:59] meetings
[7:00] three three meetings we've got I think
[7:03] nine verses eight or nine verses but
[7:05] we're doing good it don't matter we'll
[7:07] we'll get dark but I'm enjoying it
[7:09] anyway so we've been having a good time
[7:10] doing it but just remember that remember
[7:13] the ones that are away from us for the
[7:15] weekend Richard and and Anna and Abby
[7:18] Grace and uh brother Aaron and Sarah and
[7:22] the boys are up at uh the Dales today so
[7:25] remember them remember all the others
[7:27] the different ones and remember the now
[7:30] to the brothers that are going to go
[7:33] with the uh Father's Day fishing trip
[7:36] which will be starting this Thursday
[7:39] uh if you would meet after the more the
[7:42] evening service this evening just for a
[7:45] few minutes to lay out what we need to
[7:47] do you know for uh a chance to be able
[7:50] to go to our father's day trip and I
[7:53] understand that the sisters are going to
[7:56] try to get together and some of them are
[7:59] going to be doing things and and then
[8:01] they said there's going to go I believe
[8:03] the moles or somewhere to eat so you
[8:06] know all of you want to go that's you're
[8:08] very welcome we can't set a date for
[8:11] everybody we'd kind of talked about
[8:13] changing the Father's Day weekend
[8:16] meeting because of some that couldn't go
[8:18] but then we found out that some couldn't
[8:21] go the other way so might as well leave
[8:23] it alone and you know and just go and do
[8:25] the best we can but it'll be trying to
[8:28] help us to understand and we always have
[8:30] a good time fellowshipping together
[8:32] there and if you like to play horseshoes
[8:36] you you find out who the champ is to the
[8:38] crowd around here and uh we don't have
[8:41] no problem with that we make Tony throw
[8:43] backwards
[8:44] he can't pitch for the rest of us he
[8:47] either has one handicap one way or the
[8:49] other he has to to walk 10 Paces back or
[8:52] something because he wins too much but
[8:55] you know but we have a good time doing
[8:57] it and a good time fellowshipping all
[8:59] right and then brother Bob black will be
[9:01] preaching this coming Wednesday so
[9:03] remember that and just pray that the
[9:05] Lord would bless is that all the
[9:07] announcements I'm gently missed
[9:09] something
[9:11] Romans 10.
[9:13] the heavenly father we thank you for
[9:16] this day we love you and we thank you
[9:17] for your presence Among Us you've been
[9:20] here in the singing and the worshiping
[9:22] Lord and praying and the Sunday School
[9:24] classes and the doings Lord and we just
[9:27] appreciate you the little children Lord
[9:29] they love to come by every day and show
[9:31] me what they've done I like that Lord
[9:34] because we encourage them to to be and
[9:38] do and help and the teachers to work
[9:40] with them we love you father for you
[9:43] love the little children and father we
[9:45] we just thank you for all things and we
[9:47] ask you to guide us now as we speak
[9:49] about you you come on the scene and open
[9:51] your word unto us that we may walk in
[9:53] the light of Your Love forgive our sins
[9:55] cover Us by the blood and keep us in
[9:58] Jesus name Amen brother Doherty said
[10:01] Sister Mary was doing pretty good she's
[10:03] able to get up and doing some walking
[10:06] and thanks she's still having trouble
[10:08] with the blood pressure so pray for her
[10:12] that the Lord will straighten that out
[10:14] and get everything right but she is able
[10:16] we were down the other day and she just
[10:18] stuck both hands up when the lady in the
[10:21] doctor or something said can you move
[10:22] your arms was she just you know and she
[10:25] doesn't have any slurred or speech and
[10:26] he said the swelling's going down so all
[10:30] right thank God for for doing that we
[10:33] believe it
[10:34] we expect it uh thank God for touching
[10:37] brother out there Wednesday night when
[10:39] you've been having trouble trying to get
[10:41] his arm to go up after the operation
[10:43] well then he'd be sitting there and try
[10:45] to move it up well like Wednesday night
[10:48] while as the Bible says he sent his word
[10:50] and healed us
[10:52] why Wade was preaching he just
[10:55] and raised his arm we thank God for that
[10:59] that's God's word
[11:02] my life and we believe it right Romans
[11:05] 10.
[11:10] 13.
[11:14] for whosoever shall call upon the name
[11:15] of the Lord shall be saved
[11:18] how then shall they he hey they call on
[11:22] him in whom they have not believed and
[11:25] how shall they believe in him of whom
[11:27] they have not heard and how shall they
[11:29] hear without a preacher all right so we
[11:31] got that right don't make no nothing out
[11:34] of us it makes a great God doesn't it
[11:37] and how shall they preach except they be
[11:39] sent now that's the point right amen and
[11:43] it is written how beautiful are the feet
[11:44] of them that preach the gospel of peace
[11:47] and bring Glad Tidings of good things
[11:50] they have not all obeyed the gospel
[11:53] prize said Lord
[11:56] who hath believed our report
[11:58] so then Faith cometh by hearing
[12:02] and hearing how by the word of God you
[12:06] may be seated the Lord add his Blessing
[12:09] to the reading of the word
[12:11] now
[12:13] I'm trying to get a point across to all
[12:16] of us
[12:17] you know
[12:19] and uh
[12:21] helping us to see something about who we
[12:24] are amen
[12:26] because it does no good to know who
[12:28] everybody else is and what they're doing
[12:29] that's fine
[12:31] but to know who we are and what we're
[12:34] doing
[12:35] and the hour that we're living in our
[12:37] time
[12:38] and seeing that
[12:40] you know the end of all things has come
[12:42] upon us surely we believe that about the
[12:44] way the world is going and everything's
[12:45] happening you know and we don't set no
[12:49] dates we don't set no times we don't
[12:51] worry about that it's just the prophet
[12:55] said that the one thing he saw that was
[12:58] holding off the coming of the Lord was
[13:00] what
[13:01] the Readiness of the Bride
[13:05] all right see then that's what's holding
[13:07] it off the Readiness of the Bride see
[13:09] and we believe that all right so then
[13:12] we're trying to talk about
[13:15] a positive attitude
[13:18] you know
[13:19] a positive if anybody
[13:22] ought to have a positive attitude in
[13:23] order to be the bride of Christ in this
[13:25] end time
[13:26] because now uh you had problems down
[13:29] through the ages of lack of of uh
[13:33] information abilities Etc uh you know
[13:37] you had problems with even not having
[13:40] the equipment to do with but see now we
[13:43] have we can read the Bible we can read
[13:46] The Prophet's message we can do all of
[13:48] the things and and all like that because
[13:51] we're in the end time there's never an
[13:54] age it's been like this even the great
[13:55] writings of Paul and Peter and them are
[13:59] not compared and get me right what I'm
[14:02] saying now they're not compared for the
[14:04] amount that you and I have
[14:06] of the ability to be able to study the
[14:10] word of God all right
[14:12] and in doing that then my point I've
[14:15] asked a question and I want to ask it
[14:17] many times of us because I want us to
[14:20] think
[14:21] why are we any different than any other
[14:25] denomination
[14:27] cult
[14:29] oh we don't we're not a caught brother
[14:31] Dale well you know all it takes is one
[14:33] person to be one it doesn't take a whole
[14:34] group you know and all it takes is one
[14:37] person to be a denomination you don't
[14:39] have to have a whole group with you you
[14:41] can be one by yourself you can pull back
[14:44] and
[14:45] you're a little Shale and you know be a
[14:48] denomination yourself all right but what
[14:51] has been my point that I've asked
[14:54] what is the difference between us and
[14:58] the other churches
[15:01] all right
[15:03] now
[15:04] if you've been listening to me you can't
[15:07] put it on uh well we got this and where
[15:10] we got that
[15:12] oh you know
[15:15] remember you got to Anchor it into
[15:18] something
[15:19] you can talk about the message that we
[15:21] have
[15:22] and that's true
[15:24] but remember each age had a message
[15:29] right his church age had a messenger and
[15:31] a message all right
[15:33] see then what makes us different than
[15:36] any other age
[15:37] or any other peoples
[15:40] and the main thing that I've tried to
[15:42] bring it to you is that the end of all
[15:45] things has come and there's not another
[15:47] age to come
[15:49] so this is the last age so it's a
[15:51] wonderful time in an age but what do we
[15:54] put it on well we believe this
[15:56] we believe God sent a prophet they
[15:58] believe Luther was a man of God for
[16:00] their day all right
[16:02] they still quote Luther and and claiming
[16:05] that
[16:06] but you see then we can wind up and be
[16:08] as big a cult denomination Etc as
[16:12] anybody else has ever been
[16:15] by
[16:16] our own sales of not having something
[16:20] personal because you can't have a
[16:22] positive attitude if you don't have
[16:24] something personal that's my whole point
[16:27] if you don't have something personal to
[16:28] you you don't have a positive attitude
[16:30] you've got a mental makeup mental makeup
[16:36] to just trying to be something a
[16:40] positive attitude
[16:41] now what have I said about a positive
[16:43] attitude a positive attitude is not
[16:45] people that there's people in this world
[16:47] that are totally positive you can't get
[16:49] them to talk negative whatsoever
[16:51] you know they're positive about
[16:53] everything they're positive about this
[16:55] positive about that but that's not what
[16:57] I'm talking about
[16:58] I'm talking about why or how come you
[17:01] got a positive attitude
[17:03] in Bible terminologies those who had a
[17:07] problem had a
[17:09] positive attitude was those who had a
[17:12] personal experience
[17:15] in their time
[17:18] and that's what made them positive
[17:20] we're getting down to the end of it
[17:21] there on Sunday you know that brother
[17:24] random said it and I'll review it a
[17:26] minute he said I like what job said
[17:29] job didn't say I think I believe what
[17:32] job says I know my redeemer living
[17:37] all right see that's a positive attitude
[17:42] that that I know doesn't mean I hope
[17:47] it was something revealed to him
[17:51] amen or it would have been mental
[17:54] thoughts
[17:56] and Concepts but it wasn't that it was
[17:58] something personal
[18:00] to him
[18:03] God has spoke to his heart
[18:06] well as he spoke to you and I
[18:09] am or what makes it different to
[18:11] anything else as far as putting side by
[18:14] side
[18:15] you can find churches
[18:17] in the denominational churches that the
[18:20] women don't cut their hair don't paint
[18:22] their face don't wear vulgar clothing
[18:24] and all the men they look like men and
[18:26] who
[18:27] you can see that in
[18:29] denominational churches
[18:31] well is that the only difference there
[18:33] he is
[18:35] you know is it just something that we
[18:38] have done we were talking about
[18:39] something last night that really gets me
[18:42] and I told them about it in the Bible
[18:44] study
[18:46] what gets me is
[18:50] is the people of this message now that
[18:52] are falling away
[18:54] you know claiming brother Brown was
[18:55] wrong or this was this or that or the
[18:57] other are you know
[18:59] oh
[19:01] how come
[19:02] that the women start out cutting their
[19:05] hair painting their face and putting on
[19:07] shorts and the men start doing basically
[19:10] about the same thing
[19:15] now come on you know it's right
[19:19] that man stood right here in this Pulpit
[19:21] a few years ago priests probably his
[19:23] first sermon away from home
[19:26] and preached a good message
[19:29] a few weeks later
[19:31] he heard that brother Branham was wrong
[19:33] about the dates of the county the pillar
[19:36] of fire and a different thing
[19:37] and he just went out of the message
[19:40] went back into the world
[19:42] well you know what
[19:44] if we went back in the world
[19:47] it meant he never did have nothing
[19:50] now you tell me come on sisters you tell
[19:54] me that because the pastor backslides
[19:57] the prophet would backslide or somebody
[19:59] would backslide it's going to put you
[20:02] Contour to this word
[20:04] this word says for you not to cut your
[20:07] heart this word says for you not to
[20:09] paint your face this word says for you
[20:11] not to do these things
[20:14] what doings is it why is it that people
[20:17] automatically they run back to the World
[20:19] when they backslide
[20:21] was because it didn't have anything
[20:23] right
[20:25] what does it matter where you could
[20:27] prove that brother Branham was wrong or
[20:28] whatever this Bible says
[20:34] this Bible teaches what a baptism in the
[20:37] name of the Lord Jesus Christ this Bible
[20:39] teaches one God are we going to deny
[20:42] truth
[20:43] even if we could prove a message fella
[20:45] was wrong about something
[20:49] come on
[20:52] it means we didn't have nothing to start
[20:54] with
[20:55] we had a mental concept
[21:00] and like Joyce was one that was really
[21:02] good last night talking about because
[21:03] she came up to it she was raised up
[21:06] through the message
[21:08] you didn't cut your heart he didn't
[21:09] paint your face why because you're
[21:10] scared to death you're gonna get a
[21:12] whooping if you did
[21:15] well that was the best way of her saying
[21:16] it
[21:18] right that was a good way of saying it
[21:19] it wasn't a revelation
[21:23] then the prophet says you can't get a
[21:25] Holy Ghost Field woman but to put on a
[21:27] pair of pants
[21:29] you couldn't get a holy ghost feel
[21:30] warmer to cut her hair
[21:33] or wear makeup once she's heard the
[21:35] truth
[21:36] now until we hear the truth we're not
[21:38] responsible
[21:39] but then when the truth comes well
[21:41] that's my whole point
[21:43] what is the difference between us and
[21:46] anything else
[21:50] yeah
[21:51] any other church or systems of doing
[21:55] if you took
[21:58] and not call names but just put this
[22:01] group compared to this group
[22:04] the worldly churches that we call them
[22:06] a lot of times would outweigh us
[22:10] in their
[22:11] giving and caring and loving
[22:16] but what's our idea
[22:18] they're not in the message so we ain't
[22:20] gonna help them
[22:23] right
[22:27] in here and then we'll help them
[22:30] we're not to go out there and try to get
[22:31] them where did that end at
[22:34] you understand
[22:37] could it be
[22:39] that we have as we talked about
[22:46] that
[22:48] most of our faith
[22:51] you know the word faith means revelation
[22:56] is mental
[23:02] you mean if they could prove to you
[23:03] brother around and been married five
[23:04] times
[23:05] that you do away with water baptism I
[23:08] ain't gonna do that because he was wrong
[23:10] that means he's based on him
[23:15] if brother Dale backslides go down in
[23:18] the world and lost
[23:19] does that mean
[23:22] but the Bible's not right
[23:25] and the prophet's not right
[23:29] but see we use those things as crutches
[23:31] or excuses
[23:36] what does it matter
[23:39] this prophet's message has led me to an
[23:42] understanding of God that I didn't have
[23:45] prior to them
[23:48] so I thank God for the understanding
[23:51] right
[23:53] right if a dumb donkey tells you the
[23:55] truth you're supposed to rejoice
[23:57] you don't beat the Donkey
[24:00] right
[24:02] you're supposed to rejoice
[24:04] but see if the most of our faith then is
[24:07] mental
[24:10] then what have we got
[24:17] you are you understanding me
[24:22] we know and was covering Sunday that
[24:25] Peter
[24:29] he said if that be thee Lord bid me come
[24:32] he said come
[24:35] Peter stepped right out on the water and
[24:37] started walking
[24:38] until he began to see the circumstances
[24:41] that was around him and he began to sink
[24:44] and the prophet gave a great
[24:46] illustration of what
[24:49] on perfect faith and I'd suggest you you
[24:52] listen to that message or read it
[24:54] but he he said
[24:57] Peter lost his substance
[25:00] but still had his profession
[25:03] and like I said
[25:06] it's not written you know that he was
[25:09] splashing and slumbering and trying he
[25:12] started sinking before he was too far
[25:14] down he's began to cry out and he lost
[25:17] not he he lost the substance under him
[25:19] but somehow that substance got put back
[25:21] in him because I don't think Jesus had
[25:23] to struggle to pull him up and then lift
[25:25] him up and carry back into the boat he
[25:27] just put back under him what was under
[25:29] him and he walked right back into the
[25:30] boat right
[25:32] all right
[25:34] just trying to show you a point
[25:37] that he never lost his profession he
[25:40] said Lord help me
[25:43] all right
[25:47] well see then if that be true then he
[25:50] went from a
[25:53] substance under him
[25:56] by believing Jesus Christ to be God
[26:01] and he lost that substance part but he
[26:05] still had his confession
[26:09] of who Jesus was
[26:12] could we be that away right amen
[26:15] proud
[26:18] remember the only thing in Peter in one
[26:21] minute and the next minute was the fact
[26:23] that he lost the substance he had under
[26:24] his feet
[26:26] because the next minute he was in the
[26:27] boat
[26:28] he got back some way
[26:32] so he had his confession it's all we
[26:35] have a confession
[26:37] or is it a revelation
[26:43] you mean somebody could come along in
[26:44] the message what they're doing now and
[26:46] it's confusing a lot of people right
[26:48] with great philosophies and preaching
[26:51] and claiming this Prophet taught this
[26:53] and he taught that and
[26:55] and deceiving the people
[27:01] true
[27:04] until how great followings
[27:08] well there was something wrong with the
[27:09] person who follows those things
[27:13] they lost their substance
[27:19] they lost their great revelation
[27:23] they put a gun to your head one day and
[27:25] said do you believe that Jesus Christ to
[27:28] be almighty God
[27:30] it's going to be a decision then of
[27:32] whether or not you say yes or no
[27:37] if you've got a substance you'll say yes
[27:43] but if you've got a confession you'll
[27:45] say well I don't know
[27:49] he's all not they're not not going to
[27:52] do it's been happening before in time
[27:59] we we think we're in a day when things
[28:01] can't take place
[28:02] all right
[28:03] you better life at that and get out of
[28:05] your thoughts
[28:06] you know
[28:08] but if the biggest portion of our faith
[28:11] is mental faith
[28:13] and remember we went through that you're
[28:15] not saved by mental faith
[28:18] we went through that you were not healed
[28:20] by mental faith
[28:21] but you must have mental Faith first
[28:28] mental faith is based upon the word of
[28:31] God Amen
[28:34] but our problem is instead of it being
[28:37] what we read in verse 17 so then faith
[28:40] comes by hearing
[28:42] and hearing by the word of God
[28:48] it must be that somebody is messing with
[28:51] the food
[28:53] you know what I mean
[28:55] the word's not coming forth in his
[28:57] purity
[28:58] because if it is it'll have the same
[29:01] results
[29:04] go to the same word
[29:06] all right
[29:08] so then
[29:10] mental faith
[29:14] the prophet said on Blasphemous names
[29:16] the biggest portion of our faith is
[29:17] mental faith
[29:19] you see memory fight studying the word
[29:23] of God he said brings us to a mental
[29:25] recognition
[29:28] a mental recognition
[29:32] all right wonderful
[29:34] we've got to have that
[29:37] there's nobody in the Bible ever got the
[29:39] holy ghost that didn't hear the word of
[29:41] God first now come on show it to him in
[29:43] the Bible
[29:44] they heard the word first
[29:47] before they got the Holy Ghost
[29:48] all right
[29:52] and he said we went through these quotes
[29:59] he said if
[30:01] you haven't received the Holy Ghost
[30:04] there's something wrong with your faith
[30:08] you remember that
[30:12] something wrong with your faith
[30:16] because God said
[30:18] repent every one of you be baptized in
[30:20] the name of Jesus Christ for the
[30:22] remission of sin and you shall receive
[30:24] the gift of the Holy Ghost
[30:29] well I don't understand how come God
[30:31] hadn't give it to me I've done
[30:33] everything I thought could be done
[30:43] well it just must be that it's not meant
[30:46] for me
[30:48] well okay you just took your past self
[30:50] out of the situation
[30:52] because you know what your confession is
[30:54] it's not meant for you
[30:57] so
[30:58] it's not meant for you
[31:02] well no no you shouldn't talk like that
[31:05] I've done everything I could do I
[31:07] repented I've got baptized I've done
[31:10] everything I could do
[31:13] don't understand how come I didn't get
[31:15] the Holy Ghost
[31:21] there's something wrong somewhere
[31:23] because God made the promise
[31:29] so now we're either saying God is a liar
[31:31] or we're the liar
[31:33] so that's that's no problem right
[31:36] is that any problem I think we know who
[31:39] that is I think we know who the liar is
[31:44] and we say we've done everything
[31:47] but I'm not going to give up yeah oh
[31:52] okay come on I'm not going to quit oh
[31:59] but yet we love to quote what people say
[32:03] and you know people that said those
[32:05] things maybe got an experience
[32:09] I remember in the Baptist Church because
[32:11] I don't run around and come along and
[32:12] told it later I believe it was Buddy
[32:14] Robinson
[32:15] I'm not certain about that name but
[32:17] anyhow
[32:18] the man said he went out in the
[32:20] cornfield and got that on his knees and
[32:22] he said
[32:23] God if you don't give me the Holy Ghost
[32:27] he said then you'll find a pile of bones
[32:29] right now you're in this field
[32:32] well you know what he got the Holy Ghost
[32:36] when how many people went out in the
[32:37] field and got that on their knees as we
[32:39] call it her closet or or whatever you're
[32:41] doing and saying now God you're going to
[32:44] find a pile of bones right here
[32:47] if you don't give me the Holy Ghost
[32:51] well then it don't come
[32:54] is it God's fault
[32:56] or is it our fault
[33:02] which one are we going to base it on
[33:05] well
[33:07] Lord I've come I've confessed all of my
[33:10] wrongs
[33:11] I've done everything you know
[33:15] and why haven't you give me the Holy
[33:16] Ghost
[33:17] all right now let's suppose you have
[33:19] done that
[33:21] and it doesn't come
[33:27] suppose you have gotten rid of
[33:29] everything
[33:31] and you're right
[33:32] you know
[33:34] all right
[33:37] but you see what you're trying to do is
[33:40] you're trying to make God come on the
[33:43] scene and save you
[33:47] instead of doing what he's saying
[33:55] what is it in Romans worth it we confess
[33:57] with the mouth and believe in the heart
[34:02] but then what we want to do is like in
[34:04] the upper room experience with the
[34:05] disciples
[34:07] remember
[34:09] the prophet explaining that a little bit
[34:11] one day he said one of them was probably
[34:14] saying well I think we got it
[34:20] you know
[34:21] we've seen the sick Hill we've seen the
[34:23] dead rays in our ministry
[34:26] and he told us to come and wait but he
[34:28] didn't say how long
[34:30] so let's just take it by faith
[34:36] he said somebody stood up in the crowd
[34:37] and said wait a minute
[34:39] we don't have what he said
[34:43] well the rest of y'all stay up here if
[34:45] you don't I'm going to take it by faith
[34:47] go ahead go out the door go to the guy
[34:50] waiting out there with a knife on you
[34:53] I just changed my Doctrine I'm coming
[34:56] back with y'all
[34:59] not being silly being truthful
[35:03] when you put on the spot
[35:05] you find out whether or not you got the
[35:07] goods
[35:09] right
[35:11] right
[35:12] as I said a moment ago then let somebody
[35:15] try to talk you out off
[35:17] the revelation of one God
[35:19] that's good for you
[35:21] is really good for you for somebody to
[35:24] just get all over you amen
[35:27] and just scream and holler right
[35:30] and quote scriptures to you right every
[35:32] kind of thing
[35:34] cause we'll get down if we get time we
[35:36] don't just seen it
[35:39] you know God loves to test your faith
[35:44] see after you've done all to do or the
[35:47] prophet say stand well that's what the
[35:49] Bible said
[35:50] stand
[35:58] what we think we can do
[36:01] remember he doesn't do it as a demanding
[36:05] point
[36:08] you remember I told you about the
[36:09] preacher that told me one day he said
[36:11] I'm not
[36:13] I'm not working on command of the devil
[36:17] so I'm working on commanding the Lord
[36:21] yeah it's scripture
[36:24] the Bible says commands ye me
[36:28] well
[36:32] I told him I said
[36:34] that doesn't mean what you're
[36:36] interpreting it to mean
[36:39] because you don't demand anything from
[36:41] God
[36:43] you accept it by faith
[36:46] and you believe it and it's up to him to
[36:50] bring to pies what's your confession is
[36:53] right right
[36:55] so what you've done all you can do and
[36:56] you're standing right to stand
[36:59] but I I just can't do
[37:02] I stood for two years
[37:09] how about you
[37:13] two years I confessed
[37:16] after coming in this message not before
[37:19] I was a deacon for home for five or six
[37:22] years I was teaching adult Sunday School
[37:24] classes and things
[37:29] I saw many signs and wonders many things
[37:33] before I ever heard of this message
[37:37] but when I heard this man talking about
[37:40] a new birth
[37:42] it wasn't an emotional
[37:45] work-up situation that he was explaining
[37:50] it was a person he was talking about
[37:54] and when he began to talk about that
[37:56] person I knew that person was living in
[37:58] me
[38:00] well I mean he's in the message you
[38:02] believe it here's a dick and you're
[38:03] doing all these things
[38:05] see I knew there was something wrong
[38:11] now what would have happened if I'd have
[38:12] done like most people
[38:14] as the preacher told me you're in the
[38:16] message why don't you claim you got the
[38:18] Holy Ghost
[38:23] another
[38:25] just take it by faith
[38:28] well I was trying my best to
[38:33] me but you can't make God do what you
[38:36] want him to do
[38:38] don't try it
[38:42] wait on him
[38:44] we're waiting the right way
[38:48] does that mean by Peter Peter's still
[38:51] had his confession you are God get me
[38:54] back where I was
[38:58] gonna be recognized as the only way he
[39:00] could be saved
[39:05] but you see we think that we it's
[39:08] because we know the message
[39:11] but that means we're saved
[39:13] but we think we know the Bible that
[39:16] means we're saved
[39:19] and it was talking about last night you
[39:22] know that brother Branham never come to
[39:23] correct this book
[39:25] that I'm holding up here called the
[39:26] Bible
[39:27] he come to tell us that this Bible is
[39:29] right
[39:30] and even the the ends and the butts is
[39:32] in the right place
[39:37] well how come we didn't understand it
[39:39] because of what we'd been taught
[39:44] he didn't change the teaching of it the
[39:47] Bible never taught a trinity but
[39:49] secretly taught of one God and he
[39:51] finally showed us the secrets
[39:59] what do you understand
[40:03] the biggest portion of our faith is
[40:05] mental faith
[40:08] but now mental faith
[40:12] is like this let's see this is where I
[40:14] wrote it down
[40:18] you can act like you're healed
[40:21] you can pretend you're healed
[40:24] by mental faith
[40:27] now don't give up
[40:29] because that can lead you
[40:31] to a spiritual revelation
[40:35] you can pretend or act like you're saved
[40:40] you can pretend you're saved
[40:43] but you're not saved by mental faith
[40:51] has God
[40:52] and accepted you
[40:55] amen well I said to Jesus Christ I've
[40:58] done all I can do but has he come and
[41:00] accepted you
[41:05] but you understand my point
[41:09] it's easy to believe in healing if you
[41:12] pray one prayer and you see it done
[41:20] it would have been easy for Abraham
[41:24] to really be a good believer
[41:29] if a day that he heard from God the baby
[41:32] come
[41:36] now may I quote the prophet
[41:41] he said it's a whole lot greater for you
[41:44] to have to take the word of God
[41:46] and stand on that word of God and wait
[41:49] on God to fulfill that then it is an
[41:52] instant miracle healing
[41:56] you remember that
[41:59] oh yeah pray for somebody instantly
[42:03] Glory Hallelujah well I believe in that
[42:06] now
[42:07] don't we sing God do it
[42:12] right but the greater faith
[42:15] the greater point is to just take God's
[42:18] word
[42:20] and stand right there
[42:22] when everything is opposition against
[42:24] you
[42:25] even the preachers against you
[42:30] he's trying to explain it some way
[42:32] and God doesn't spoke to you when it is
[42:36] and you know the worst thing to do it
[42:37] he's just about talk you out of it
[42:39] I remember brother Moe talking about one
[42:42] time I can't remember what it was but
[42:45] that he saw it before he ever heard of
[42:47] the message you know it was in the Bible
[42:49] just use an example that he saw serpent
[42:51] seed or something
[42:54] and he said you know what I said I went
[42:55] to church and they talked me out of that
[43:01] well
[43:03] that's pretty well what's taking place
[43:04] right
[43:09] with a mental faith
[43:14] the disciples
[43:18] three years and a half
[43:22] they saw the Miracles they saw the signs
[43:26] they saw the healings
[43:28] the Wonders the dead rays
[43:31] you know what never converted to one of
[43:33] them
[43:37] come on
[43:41] never one of them got converted
[43:45] and to prove it
[43:47] that they didn't
[43:48] they ever wanted run from him when he
[43:51] come to the last moment
[43:56] even though Jesus would say it do you
[43:59] now believe
[44:05] yeah were they where were they when he
[44:07] was crucified
[44:11] the closest one that we can know of
[44:14] was John
[44:16] at least John goes in and says let me
[44:19] out of the body
[44:21] right
[44:22] Peter and the rest of them running like
[44:24] crazy at least John did want to request
[44:28] for the body
[44:31] well yet none of them
[44:33] and anything that could walk on
[44:38] and you know Peter
[44:40] had had a substance under his feet
[44:43] he knew a little bit about it
[44:47] and he knew that he was not the place
[44:50] that he had a substance
[44:53] because he knew if he walked out that
[44:55] door death was waiting on him
[45:01] but when he received what got him in the
[45:04] boat
[45:05] now you understand what I mean
[45:08] what brought him in the boat and saved
[45:11] him when he seen that come to pass on
[45:15] the day of Pentecost
[45:16] into his soul
[45:19] he said hey let's go outside
[45:22] come on boys
[45:27] no more fear
[45:30] right
[45:31] he wasn't stupid but there was no
[45:33] Warfare
[45:36] because he had something tangible
[45:39] I've asked you the question and I'll
[45:41] keep asking it have you ever had
[45:43] anything happen if God showed you spoke
[45:47] to you revealed to you or whatever you
[45:49] want to call it
[45:50] that something was going to be that way
[45:54] and you see it come to pass
[45:59] have you ever been healed
[46:01] I'm not talking about
[46:04] waiting and doing but if you ever just
[46:06] come to a point
[46:08] that something that said
[46:10] you're healed
[46:12] and you may have to wait for months
[46:18] for it to come into reality oh yeah when
[46:20] it becomes a substance I'll say I'm
[46:22] Healed now that ain't Bible
[46:25] you are a liar amen
[46:29] if we say it that way we're a liar
[46:31] the Bible says to confess
[46:35] and you must confess before you receive
[46:39] and it must come by a mental concept
[46:42] mental I hope people understand my
[46:44] language I'm sorry
[46:47] croaky throat and bad words
[46:49] but mental
[46:55] mental faith is pretty close
[47:00] the disciples had ever right
[47:03] to get up and walk out of the upper room
[47:06] as I said a moment ago they've seen the
[47:08] sick he got a dead race in their own
[47:10] ministry right
[47:16] right and they could have walked out
[47:18] there with a pretty good
[47:20] mental concept
[47:24] we should see somebody said hold on
[47:29] maybe it was Peter and it said
[47:31] I walked on the water boys
[47:35] and he brought me back in the boat
[47:38] and I don't have under my feet
[47:41] I don't have that assurance
[47:44] that I had when I walked that day
[47:48] so I'm going to wait
[47:51] anybody in the Bible had ever amounted
[47:53] to anything at a personal revelation
[47:56] with God
[47:57] dog and want to go with somebody
[47:59] you've heard this over and over
[48:02] Moses at the burning bush God said I'm
[48:05] the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[48:08] he said wonderful I believe it I believe
[48:10] God you're the god of Abraham Isaac
[48:12] Jacob but I'm not going to Egypt
[48:15] oh yeah
[48:18] he said give me something
[48:21] that's personal to me right
[48:27] he said I am that I am
[48:30] Moses said let's go to Egypt
[48:33] right
[48:35] he had something related to him when he
[48:38] got to Egypt what did he say
[48:41] he told them the god of Abraham Isaac
[48:43] and Jacob sent him down
[48:45] they said who is he he said I am
[48:49] that was pretty close right
[48:52] you know to pharaoh
[48:54] it looked pretty close
[48:57] for him not to explain the great
[48:59] Revelation and just say I am
[49:02] they're going to take him out of here he
[49:03] said I am
[49:05] that's pretty close
[49:07] Moses you're gonna take him out he said
[49:10] the one that met me told me to say this
[49:12] and he said what I'm saying
[49:15] well you know what one day he walked out
[49:19] something personal
[49:23] it had ever been revealed to you that
[49:25] there's one God
[49:26] or is it what brother random talk
[49:30] you asked the biggest force of the
[49:31] preacher is this message they can't
[49:33] preach without quotes
[49:36] they can't preach the scriptures
[49:41] and show it in the scriptures
[49:46] they gotta have a quote
[49:52] well you know how much I quote so you
[49:54] know I'm not against quote so don't be
[49:56] stupid
[49:58] all right
[49:59] the biggest force in what I'm doing a
[50:01] lot of time you don't know what it's
[50:02] laying right here I'm quoting brother
[50:04] Branham
[50:06] the only way you're going to know that
[50:08] if you're in the message
[50:10] right
[50:12] okay
[50:14] watch now
[50:18] you remember what we went through that
[50:20] even a psychic
[50:23] with mental power
[50:26] could break lives
[50:31] a magician
[50:34] but around said a cheap trick
[50:38] pull pranks on people break lives
[50:43] what about a man walking on colds of
[50:46] Fire
[50:48] and it's not burning him
[50:55] pretty good mental power because I'm not
[50:57] going to try it
[50:59] you say well you wouldn't do it I didn't
[51:00] say I wouldn't do it I said I'm not
[51:02] going to try it
[51:03] when I walk across there you better
[51:05] blank a bank on one thing God told me to
[51:07] do it
[51:08] all right then I'm going to ask him for
[51:10] a second opinion but not the Holy Ghost
[51:12] to the father or whatever to get to you
[51:14] know what I mean I'm just honest
[51:16] and you need to be too yeah
[51:20] because if he tells me to walk out there
[51:21] I ain't worried about it
[51:23] he'll provide the way
[51:26] amen but until he tells me I'm not going
[51:27] to walk out to her
[51:29] because I know a mental Faith what about
[51:31] brother random even using that
[51:34] as I said to about the little girl that
[51:37] the bracelet was hanging in the room now
[51:39] remember what he said
[51:42] he said we didn't have time for her to
[51:44] get to a doctor
[51:47] said we had to have something
[51:48] immediately
[51:51] she didn't have time to set two weeks
[51:53] and confessions healed
[51:58] he said make that bracelet swing around
[52:00] around stop it and make it do things
[52:03] one message he said she said that ain't
[52:05] nothing but
[52:07] psychics or
[52:09] he said I knew you'd say that
[52:15] but he turned and he said she said can
[52:17] you do it
[52:20] well you know what
[52:23] he was a prophet
[52:25] when a prophet's put on the spot
[52:28] he didn't like me and you now you go
[52:31] home and you hang up a bracelet and you
[52:33] stare at it
[52:36] well you better remember one thing if
[52:38] you get it to move you better say it was
[52:41] God
[52:42] now if you don't you're going to get the
[52:44] mental attitude that you something
[52:48] right
[52:50] and now time to wait
[52:54] and it moved around and stopped and she
[52:56] caught it and was healed
[53:00] right
[53:03] but we're going to get down to a little
[53:05] closer point because that was a mental
[53:07] part talking about
[53:09] oh
[53:11] with no time or whatsoever
[53:14] I mean one of these days we're going to
[53:15] get on to faith being a substance
[53:19] it's a whole lot different attitude when
[53:21] he made a statement one day
[53:26] remember the chief magician could swing
[53:28] it around and do the break of glass
[53:30] but let's see that Chief magician do
[53:32] what he said
[53:35] he said I forgot my knife it's laying
[53:37] over on the dresser
[53:40] he said but if I believe it it'll be in
[53:43] my pocket
[53:46] he said now that stumped you and I admit
[53:51] that stumped me
[53:55] do you admit it's not you
[53:59] but if it happens
[54:01] see then you can go back and anchor to
[54:03] that
[54:06] and see it because it's a substance
[54:08] all right we don't want to get onto that
[54:11] we want to we want to stay on the point
[54:12] of understanding one thing the right
[54:15] mental attitude
[54:17] toward any promise of God
[54:20] we'll bring it to Pious now what's the
[54:22] right mental attitude
[54:25] what's the right mental attitude
[54:28] go ahead to number one on the
[54:30] who takes I want you to just read
[54:32] something
[54:33] with me
[54:35] that a prophet had to say
[54:38] he's talking about a right mental
[54:40] attitude
[54:41] and I read this one I liked
[54:45] I thought that's exactly right but I
[54:47] ain't never heard it like that
[54:49] look what he said
[54:51] he's talking about healing
[54:53] principles of healing and look what he
[54:55] says because that's the message
[54:56] principles Divine Healing preached in
[54:58] 1951 923
[55:00] 30. now the first thing a person does
[55:03] when you get sick
[55:07] maybe around home you have a few
[55:09] remedies
[55:10] and things you try
[55:13] right
[55:16] I mean you get a bad cough you take a
[55:18] cough drop you take off syrup
[55:22] those are the right men latitude
[55:27] but what we think the right mental
[55:29] attitude
[55:31] I'm not coughing
[55:33] I'm not coughing
[55:36] we think that's the way we talk
[55:38] ourselves into faith
[55:40] now he's explaining simple mental Faith
[55:42] a sense of sensible way
[55:47] try a few remedies
[55:50] no bless God I'm going straight to God
[55:52] with it
[55:53] well okay amen
[55:56] but don't blame me because I take a
[55:58] cough drop
[56:00] right
[56:02] what he said maybe around home you have
[56:04] a few remedies and things you try the
[56:06] next thing is is maybe you call the
[56:09] doctor
[56:12] that's a sensible
[56:14] thing to do
[56:18] call the doctor
[56:21] all right now there's another quote that
[56:24] you can read that they used to use us a
[56:27] lot down in a certain church we were
[56:28] that and because brother random made a
[56:30] statement one day and I can give you the
[56:32] quote if you'd like it he said you don't
[56:35] have no right to go before God till you
[56:37] go to the doctor first
[56:38] and you could go out to be prayed for
[56:40] literally I've heard the preacher say
[56:43] you go doctor first I ain't praying for
[56:46] you
[56:47] supposed to go to doctor first now you
[56:49] showed me that and brother Brown's
[56:50] message what he done
[56:52] now you'd have to stop every prayer line
[56:54] it ever was
[56:56] so you know that's not what he's saying
[56:59] right the first thing is to be sensible
[57:03] go to the doctor
[57:06] yeah but if I go to the doctor it means
[57:08] I ain't got no faith
[57:12] what I care what the doctor says
[57:16] is your faith based on what he says
[57:19] purple What God Says
[57:22] all right first thing take a few
[57:25] remedies
[57:28] second thing go to the doctor
[57:33] be sensible
[57:34] huh what about a a great
[57:39] person who was the height of all as we
[57:42] would call it the apex of the healing
[57:44] Ministries
[57:47] but yeah he's telling you go to the
[57:49] doctor
[57:51] met a person one day and they said
[57:52] something do you remember the quote and
[57:54] he said now there's an old doctor right
[57:56] down here said you got stomach trouble
[57:58] said there's an old doctor right down
[57:59] here specializing that kind of operation
[58:01] so go down there and let them operate on
[58:03] you
[58:06] a prophet
[58:09] well now you can prop that up by saying
[58:11] well now he could look down and see they
[58:12] didn't have no faith and they didn't
[58:14] have no this
[58:17] well so what he told him to go to the
[58:20] doctor
[58:21] well they didn't slap him a couple of
[58:22] times and say hold on a minute
[58:30] go to the doctor
[58:36] now we're going to get down to the rest
[58:37] of it right
[58:39] and if the doctor can't do you no good
[58:44] no
[58:46] then you got a right to go to God
[58:50] that's what you should do call on God
[58:55] and God is the author of circumstances
[58:57] he can do when nothing else can do when
[59:00] man comes to the end of their line God
[59:03] can do
[59:08] but don't worry about going to the
[59:09] doctor do we
[59:12] but I know people in this message that
[59:13] don't want to go to the doctor because
[59:15] they're afraid to lose their faith
[59:21] well
[59:24] come on I'm dumb stupid and hard-headed
[59:28] and I speak hard
[59:30] but if you're not going to take medicine
[59:32] don't take no medicine
[59:35] don't take no home remedies
[59:37] don't take nothing you make up because
[59:40] that's where they got their medicine
[59:42] from
[59:47] you know that Edgar Casey
[59:49] a psychic
[59:52] a lot of the medicine we probably take
[59:55] today was remedies that Edgar case if
[59:58] you've ever read a story of his life
[1:00:01] people would go to him and tell him
[1:00:03] what's wrong with him he'd tell them
[1:00:05] what medicine to go make up
[1:00:08] you know a lot of that is what you take
[1:00:10] today
[1:00:15] and really I'd rather had his psychic
[1:00:18] ability than all the medical doctors and
[1:00:21] what they could pump up and pride up you
[1:00:23] know
[1:00:24] because at least out of contact
[1:00:28] what
[1:00:31] call on God
[1:00:35] what's he saying humanly speaking what's
[1:00:37] brought around him saying
[1:00:38] we're human beings you hurt take an
[1:00:40] aspirin
[1:00:41] but see that's the way people are I
[1:00:43] ain't taking no medicine
[1:00:45] you let them get in a serious condition
[1:00:48] and you'll find out their faith begins
[1:00:50] to dwindle just away and they'll say
[1:00:53] well give me an aspirin well if you
[1:00:55] ain't going to take nothing else don't
[1:00:56] take the aspirin
[1:01:00] right
[1:01:04] if you ain't gonna do not don't eat no
[1:01:06] pokes at it
[1:01:10] that's an old home remedy of a purity
[1:01:13] for the blood
[1:01:16] green beans is a green that's a purity
[1:01:19] for your blood don't eat no green beans
[1:01:26] you see where we make ourselves to be
[1:01:27] stupid or so revelated
[1:01:31] that's what I'm getting at
[1:01:33] trying to get you to see what faith
[1:01:35] really is
[1:01:37] mental faith is a wonderful thing
[1:01:41] by mental Faith you was able to ride to
[1:01:43] church today and didn't have to walk by
[1:01:46] mental Faith you're sitting in an
[1:01:48] air-conditioned building that some of
[1:01:49] these wrapped up and some of his Fanning
[1:01:52] we can't get that together
[1:01:58] right
[1:02:00] mental faith has made us with great
[1:02:02] ability
[1:02:08] mental Faith it's strong
[1:02:13] the disciples all they had until Jesus
[1:02:16] died and gave them the Holy Ghost was
[1:02:17] mental faith
[1:02:20] you have to sing the dead race to seek
[1:02:22] healed and all in their Ministry
[1:02:28] mental faith and the prophet said the
[1:02:30] biggest Fortune of our faith is mental
[1:02:32] faith
[1:02:36] no brother Dale I got a holy ghost faith
[1:02:38] and I come to this message I saw that
[1:02:40] one true and living God and I saw it and
[1:02:42] I believe it because it's just one God
[1:02:43] they can't be no other way I believe it
[1:02:45] I swear by it
[1:02:47] and then some preacher comes along tells
[1:02:48] you that Jesus wouldn't God to the river
[1:02:50] of Jordan and he become God then God
[1:02:51] left him and he died
[1:02:53] hey Glory I believe that
[1:02:57] now you don't believe in one God
[1:03:01] you don't lost your own God faith you
[1:03:04] don't lost any substance you thought you
[1:03:06] had right
[1:03:09] come on that's why I'm so hard I'm sorry
[1:03:13] but I try to protect you from doctrines
[1:03:15] if there's two Souls there got to be two
[1:03:18] gods
[1:03:20] if there's two Lords they gotta be two
[1:03:22] gods
[1:03:25] that's why I'm so hard against those
[1:03:27] type of things
[1:03:28] we call it faith
[1:03:31] revelation
[1:03:33] show me where the disciples taught
[1:03:35] anything like that
[1:03:37] you don't never hear these people preach
[1:03:38] out of the Bible a too low or two Soul
[1:03:41] or
[1:03:43] right come on folks
[1:03:48] look
[1:03:49] notice and never forget this
[1:03:52] you people laying here sick and needy
[1:03:53] the right mental attitude toward any
[1:03:57] Divine promise of God will bring it to
[1:04:00] pass watch
[1:04:01] When You Believe
[1:04:06] and take God at his word
[1:04:13] say it so believe it so God will bring
[1:04:16] it to five
[1:04:19] right mental attitude towards any Divine
[1:04:21] promise that God will bring it to Pious
[1:04:22] if you're a sinner confess your sins
[1:04:29] write mental attitude
[1:04:31] believe that God saved you
[1:04:34] and then go testifying of it
[1:04:38] telling people that you're saved
[1:04:42] it'll work righteousness
[1:04:46] after a while you'll be a Christian
[1:04:50] I love that
[1:04:52] after a while
[1:04:59] great group of people over the book of
[1:05:01] Acts
[1:05:03] Paul said have you received the gift of
[1:05:05] the Holy Ghost
[1:05:06] since you believed
[1:05:09] great Believers right
[1:05:12] but they haven't got the Holy Ghost yet
[1:05:17] they had a mental Faith a truth
[1:05:24] come on it's like I was telling somebody
[1:05:26] want to go and I told you and you know
[1:05:28] it I believe this Bible
[1:05:30] I believe brother Brown's message
[1:05:34] is thus saith the Lord now a lot of
[1:05:37] things run around and said as a human
[1:05:38] being
[1:05:40] is a human being
[1:05:43] that was his thoughts or or something
[1:05:45] when he said they'll fight again and die
[1:05:47] like flies the Black Water the next
[1:05:49] message he said that was my thoughts
[1:05:54] but yet we want to make a
[1:05:57] a point out of it you don't believe it
[1:06:01] you don't believe what he said
[1:06:04] well it's like I told one brother
[1:06:08] I said brother would you mind you say
[1:06:10] quote brother random say what brother
[1:06:12] random said I handed him a book I said
[1:06:14] would you read that
[1:06:17] he looked down at it and he said I ain't
[1:06:19] reading it
[1:06:24] you know what brother Brown said
[1:06:26] and give you a direct quote where he
[1:06:28] said Luther
[1:06:30] denominator maybe not the word
[1:06:32] denominator but he said he died and went
[1:06:33] to hell
[1:06:38] you denominated
[1:06:40] Luther never denominated what's he
[1:06:42] talking about
[1:06:46] he said we'll show you what the prophet
[1:06:47] said all right I'll give you
[1:06:49] quote you won't to in the message by
[1:06:51] mental concept I can almost find you a
[1:06:54] quote seemingly contrary to it
[1:06:57] but also with the Bible give me a direct
[1:07:01] quote of a scripture and I by memory
[1:07:05] will be able to almost to give you
[1:07:07] something seemingly contrary
[1:07:10] but now we know it can't be true that's
[1:07:12] why I said the message is Right amen
[1:07:17] the prophet said things that was a human
[1:07:19] being
[1:07:22] when Elisha back there cursed those
[1:07:24] children
[1:07:25] that was not the Holy Ghost
[1:07:28] God didn't tell him to do that it was
[1:07:31] the power it was invested within him as
[1:07:34] being a prophet
[1:07:36] you don't hear Brother random calling
[1:07:38] down fire right
[1:07:40] because he had the Holy Ghost in here
[1:07:43] a lot of difference in pot and look
[1:07:45] around in Elisha Elisha was a man
[1:07:49] but man was a man but this man had the
[1:07:51] Holy Ghost about it
[1:07:53] that's why he was given more gifts than
[1:07:55] anybody all right but are you listening
[1:07:58] after a while you'll be a Christian
[1:08:04] amen confess yourself into it yes
[1:08:11] now come on
[1:08:13] am I right
[1:08:15] when you make a confession the devil
[1:08:18] appears
[1:08:19] right
[1:08:22] right he'll come running
[1:08:25] huh
[1:08:27] not a while he said well I don't know
[1:08:29] where I believe that or not he's done
[1:08:31] got you
[1:08:33] at least keep saying boo
[1:08:36] you know
[1:08:40] confession confession until he gets mad
[1:08:42] at you and run off leave you
[1:08:46] amen
[1:08:50] you see you're gonna have something when
[1:08:51] you do that
[1:08:53] all right
[1:08:55] mental attitude toward any Divine
[1:08:58] promise in the Bible will bring it to
[1:09:01] pass
[1:09:05] the Divine promise is written in the
[1:09:08] Bible
[1:09:09] and it'll bring it to pies
[1:09:12] now just keep that on your mind
[1:09:18] are you looking at it
[1:09:22] just keep that on your mind
[1:09:26] say I'm Healed
[1:09:28] say I'm saved
[1:09:32] well I don't want to lie when I ain't
[1:09:34] saved go ahead you're already a liar
[1:09:39] you're a liar if you say you're not
[1:09:40] saved because the Bible says you are
[1:09:44] let me say what he says
[1:09:46] right
[1:09:52] right we want super duper super
[1:09:54] revelation
[1:09:58] I like this one I'll get this one real
[1:10:00] quick
[1:10:01] look what he said on Thursday we would
[1:10:03] see Jesus 1960 E10
[1:10:08] now may I may I go on record just now
[1:10:11] saying this that I believe the right
[1:10:14] mental attitude toward any Divine
[1:10:15] promise of God will bring to pass
[1:10:19] if you can take the right
[1:10:21] mental attitude toward that promise
[1:10:26] and we stopped our first on that
[1:10:29] if you can take the right mental
[1:10:31] attitude what is Right mental attitude
[1:10:34] what is the right mental attitude
[1:10:37] what would be the right mental attitude
[1:10:38] if you were going to try to break lives
[1:10:41] I have the ability to do it
[1:10:43] because I've done it before
[1:10:46] right
[1:10:48] and I'm not afraid to put it on the
[1:10:49] spell
[1:10:51] right
[1:10:52] you remember brother Branham going to
[1:10:54] the meeting that time
[1:10:56] and there there was this piano or table
[1:10:58] or something was just floating around in
[1:11:00] the room
[1:11:06] I don't believe that you have an
[1:11:07] integral flow
[1:11:09] he did
[1:11:13] but you remember what he done
[1:11:16] he said let me try something
[1:11:19] now if I miss quote this you put it
[1:11:21] where it's supposed to be he said in the
[1:11:24] name of the Rose of Sharon and Lily
[1:11:26] divided right morning star fall down he
[1:11:28] said it just stayed up
[1:11:31] in the name of the father son the Holy
[1:11:33] Ghost
[1:11:35] he just stayed up didn't fall
[1:11:38] let me try one more time
[1:11:40] he said in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:11:45] down it went
[1:11:49] but the part of it is we are so dumb
[1:11:52] until we don't believe the piano could
[1:11:55] be floated by psychic power
[1:12:01] oh
[1:12:02] right
[1:12:04] right when honors don't you go argue
[1:12:06] with him he was one that said he's up in
[1:12:08] the air he's the one that said what
[1:12:09] happened about it
[1:12:12] he said I've seen witch doctors
[1:12:15] in blood right
[1:12:18] drink blood out of a human skull and rot
[1:12:21] in unknown tongues and interpret that
[1:12:29] you see if we've never experienced
[1:12:31] anything
[1:12:32] we don't believe it
[1:12:38] now how many of you I'm not going to ask
[1:12:40] a question for a point but how many of
[1:12:42] you Brothers in here ever got drunk
[1:12:44] enough to see a pink elephant
[1:12:46] now maybe you saw something else but you
[1:12:48] know what I'm talking about
[1:12:53] you know what that's real to you
[1:12:57] you run all over somebody with a knife
[1:12:58] to get away from that pink elephant
[1:13:01] but anybody else standing around I can't
[1:13:03] see the pink elephant
[1:13:09] but you're gonna tell him he can't see
[1:13:10] it
[1:13:14] see that's where we
[1:13:16] we are so super duper revelated until we
[1:13:20] don't believe in simplicity
[1:13:26] do you honestly believe that a man can
[1:13:28] walk across colds of fire and it not
[1:13:31] burning
[1:13:33] now I've never seen it done I ain't
[1:13:35] worried about it
[1:13:37] but do you believe it can be done
[1:13:41] do you believe
[1:13:45] that you can leave a tight
[1:13:47] you know raise up do
[1:13:50] Benny Hinn walked off the platform out
[1:13:53] in mid-air
[1:13:57] well that was fake
[1:14:00] well what's your super duper got doing
[1:14:02] with it
[1:14:03] if that's Faith show me the right
[1:14:08] but you understand
[1:14:10] see we think that we have such a great
[1:14:13] Revelation or thoughts
[1:14:15] but don't think about a God that allows
[1:14:18] these things I'll get back this evening
[1:14:20] to it
[1:14:22] what about where it says canker warm
[1:14:24] front worm Locus caterpillar and the
[1:14:26] Bible says my great Army that I sin
[1:14:29] among you
[1:14:31] and we know he didn't send it like make
[1:14:33] it come like produce it that way he
[1:14:36] allowed it to come right
[1:14:39] why to try you
[1:14:43] and run around and said just right God
[1:14:46] of this evil age I'm pretty sure I've
[1:14:48] got it in the nose
[1:14:49] he said this bride is to prove to Satan
[1:14:51] she won't fall like Eve
[1:14:56] for us to make light
[1:14:59] or do
[1:15:01] a snake Handler
[1:15:04] a person who drinks poison and it don't
[1:15:07] kill them why don't you do it
[1:15:11] oh I'm smarter no you're scared
[1:15:17] why don't you admit you're scared
[1:15:23] but now what's going to happen the day
[1:15:24] comes if they come walking in here with
[1:15:27] a snake
[1:15:28] the building to be cleared probably
[1:15:30] pretty quick
[1:15:31] it probably makes some extra exit doors
[1:15:34] made in the wall
[1:15:36] right
[1:15:38] no joke true
[1:15:44] but what am I going to do
[1:15:49] because if I back down I'll prove I
[1:15:51] ain't got what I'm talking about
[1:15:54] and I have no right to talk to you about
[1:15:57] something I don't have
[1:16:04] I don't talk to you about something that
[1:16:05] I haven't experienced
[1:16:07] I've seen the dead Rays I've seen the
[1:16:09] sick healed I've seen things happen at
[1:16:11] the word
[1:16:13] I've seen things that most people have
[1:16:15] never seen
[1:16:20] but I'm an exalted
[1:16:22] intellectual something for telling you
[1:16:25] about it
[1:16:32] but I thought he's supposed to be the
[1:16:33] same for all of us
[1:16:35] look what he says
[1:16:38] if you take the right mental attitude
[1:16:40] toward the promise
[1:16:45] God said it I believe it now let's take
[1:16:47] what he said
[1:16:48] for the promise is a seed
[1:16:51] right are you reading
[1:16:54] a seed goes into the ground and if it's
[1:16:57] a germatized seed got the life in it and
[1:17:00] bring forth its kind if it's put in the
[1:17:02] proper place if a seed is put into the
[1:17:05] ground
[1:17:08] promise of God is a seed
[1:17:10] can we believe it
[1:17:14] he's promised us these things can we
[1:17:16] believe it
[1:17:21] no because it he doesn't do it when we
[1:17:23] want it done that's what I was trying to
[1:17:24] explain while ago
[1:17:26] we lose our point when he doesn't do
[1:17:29] what we want him to do or at the time
[1:17:31] that it's done
[1:17:34] see then we don't look at other things
[1:17:38] and you know what we just wind up being
[1:17:40] unbelievers
[1:17:44] I'm not going to say that to Pope
[1:17:48] lay his hands on the sick
[1:17:50] and then be healed I'm not going to say
[1:17:53] that's not right
[1:17:56] I'm just going to say one thing whether
[1:17:58] he done it or you done it or brother
[1:18:00] Branham done it or Jesus done it God's A
[1:18:02] Healer
[1:18:03] that's my whole point right
[1:18:06] God's the Healer
[1:18:08] if the Beatles could sing a song and you
[1:18:10] could be healed The Beatles ain't the
[1:18:12] Healer
[1:18:16] but now you know what happened with The
[1:18:18] Beatles in the basis of them people
[1:18:20] getting up and walking that was
[1:18:21] paralyzed because they touched a mental
[1:18:25] Faith within that person that person
[1:18:28] lost control of their mentality in the
[1:18:31] bases that they went beyond their mental
[1:18:34] thoughts that they couldn't walk and
[1:18:35] they got up and walked
[1:18:37] yeah
[1:18:40] not necessarily they were healed
[1:18:43] but yet we can call it healing because
[1:18:45] they did walk when they couldn't walk
[1:18:46] before
[1:18:49] but it was a mental concept
[1:18:52] at least church we could have that much
[1:19:00] and then we wouldn't be as brother four
[1:19:01] and he said wowzy wowzy Woo you know I
[1:19:04] remember the boy ain't sick like I am
[1:19:06] you had what I had you wouldn't be
[1:19:08] bragging
[1:19:15] what are you doing wishing it on me
[1:19:21] are you trying to scare me with it
[1:19:25] remember fear is the worst thing in the
[1:19:27] world
[1:19:30] when that doctor walked in there and
[1:19:31] told me he said you've got leukemia Sam
[1:19:35] I looked back at him and I said
[1:19:38] no problem no chemo
[1:19:42] I said I'll do anything else you tell me
[1:19:43] but you're not going to give me any
[1:19:44] chemo treatments
[1:19:46] I said because what's the difference in
[1:19:47] me living three months or living six
[1:19:49] months
[1:19:50] I said you were and this is what I told
[1:19:52] him I said you're on that side of the
[1:19:53] table you're giving out the stuff I'm on
[1:19:56] this side of the table burying the
[1:19:58] people
[1:19:59] that's what I told him I said there
[1:20:01] won't be nothing
[1:20:04] he said it's not like it used to be Sam
[1:20:06] with the chemos and the all the
[1:20:08] different things I said I don't have any
[1:20:10] problems with you and I don't teach my
[1:20:12] people not to take it
[1:20:14] but I said you're not going to give it
[1:20:16] to me
[1:20:20] I went over to the other cancer
[1:20:21] specialist when he walked in he said
[1:20:25] Sam you know you got leukemia
[1:20:28] I said great you know what I told the
[1:20:30] other doctor
[1:20:31] no chemo
[1:20:34] he said but I got another thing to tell
[1:20:36] you
[1:20:37] you've got a different kind of leukemia
[1:20:40] you got one that's not going to kill you
[1:20:42] did you go out one is you gonna die with
[1:20:44] it instead of die of it because there's
[1:20:46] two leukemias I want to kill you that's
[1:20:49] it
[1:20:50] but we've seen one that had to
[1:20:53] get a little picture right up here
[1:21:00] this little kid was determined as to
[1:21:03] having
[1:21:03] the horrible leukemia
[1:21:07] she's still alive today is she married
[1:21:10] now
[1:21:13] you know we got some more pictures
[1:21:18] nursing college
[1:21:24] miracle
[1:21:28] we're not saying Lula prayed to Pryor
[1:21:31] somebody did
[1:21:34] oh but it was my prayer
[1:21:36] well then I can say real quick if I say
[1:21:38] things like that I know it wouldn't my
[1:21:39] prayer because I'm trying to build up
[1:21:41] the thing
[1:21:46] brother Al come out there Sunday
[1:21:48] and he knows it he walked by and he said
[1:21:51] just lay your hand right there
[1:21:56] he said just lay your hand right there
[1:21:59] it'll be all right I just laid my hand
[1:22:01] right there
[1:22:02] didn't pray didn't do nothing just laid
[1:22:04] my hand there
[1:22:09] but he needed more
[1:22:14] I could have said Al you're healed us
[1:22:16] that and the other but he needed more
[1:22:20] so we come Wednesday night and he
[1:22:21] couldn't move his arm up right
[1:22:26] when Wade started preaching somehow
[1:22:29] that's the word doing the healing
[1:22:33] and he raised his arm y'all didn't hear
[1:22:35] me right there I said God I know what
[1:22:37] that is
[1:22:40] if you listen to the tape you could hear
[1:22:42] it
[1:22:43] I know what he done when he raised his
[1:22:46] hand
[1:22:47] why did it matter who prayed it's the
[1:22:50] god that done it
[1:22:56] not me and you
[1:22:57] you know but I want to get credit for
[1:22:59] what I do then you didn't do nothing
[1:23:03] any problems with that
[1:23:07] because God is the Healer
[1:23:10] see that's wanting to be praised wanting
[1:23:13] to be done
[1:23:16] and I stood right here and looked back
[1:23:17] and and brother Anderson
[1:23:20] sister Anderson
[1:23:23] wanted us to pray and we prayed about
[1:23:24] them having a baby
[1:23:27] I knew they was going to have a baby
[1:23:30] it was already settled right here
[1:23:34] but how could I get that to them
[1:23:41] so what I do
[1:23:43] I pray God
[1:23:47] get what's in me that I believe into
[1:23:51] them
[1:23:54] brother Forney come up here preaching I
[1:23:56] never said a word to it we had talked we
[1:23:59] you know they had talked about
[1:24:01] needing a family or wanting a family to
[1:24:03] all around
[1:24:05] no brother Forney just went walking
[1:24:07] right down through there and he just
[1:24:09] walked right up and he said God's going
[1:24:11] to give you that job
[1:24:13] well you know what praise God
[1:24:16] it took
[1:24:18] them believing brother for
[1:24:20] CE
[1:24:21] but I'd already seen it happen
[1:24:30] I try
[1:24:34] I'll give you a little secret if you'll
[1:24:36] listen
[1:24:37] and you asked me to pray for you
[1:24:40] if I stuttered Stoner and say we'll pray
[1:24:42] about it
[1:24:45] then I'm believing with you
[1:24:50] but if I ever look at you and say
[1:24:52] you are healed
[1:24:55] then that's not me
[1:24:59] if you believe it
[1:25:04] because I'm saying what he says
[1:25:09] see faith is a whole lot different than
[1:25:10] what we think
[1:25:13] what did you see of issues did you see
[1:25:15] that no no I just take him in his word
[1:25:19] when he told me to take my kneecap off I
[1:25:21] said you ain't taking my kneecap off
[1:25:25] I still got him
[1:25:27] oh man you're a while back I started
[1:25:29] hurting the devil said see how you're
[1:25:31] gonna have took off I just laugh like
[1:25:33] everything
[1:25:34] I said buddy you 30 years behind I'm 70
[1:25:37] years old the ought to be took off by
[1:25:39] now
[1:25:43] you know what he left
[1:25:49] why don't you say What God Says
[1:25:51] sometimes and watch that devil just get
[1:25:52] away
[1:25:55] say it when everybody else is against
[1:25:57] you
[1:26:01] say it when you're the only one that can
[1:26:03] believe it
[1:26:07] because you're the only one that's
[1:26:08] revealed to
[1:26:12] mental faith
[1:26:14] can become a spiritual revelation
[1:26:20] I'm not talking about
[1:26:22] something that now listen to what my
[1:26:24] wording I'll finish it with this
[1:26:26] we'll burn around and taught us here we
[1:26:28] read it that's fine
[1:26:30] but
[1:26:31] there was healing in the Methodist
[1:26:33] healing in the Baptist healing in the
[1:26:34] Pentecostal
[1:26:37] right
[1:26:38] some of you come through Pentecostal
[1:26:39] churches
[1:26:42] somebody told me one time about going to
[1:26:43] a person's house and that is left and
[1:26:45] went down in the woods and come back and
[1:26:47] said everything's all right
[1:26:50] I believe that I believe God is real
[1:26:53] amen
[1:26:56] I believe he's running with her today to
[1:26:58] heal them
[1:27:00] and save them
[1:27:04] because he's God
[1:27:06] see we're limited even though they're
[1:27:08] not in the message
[1:27:14] you mean there's nothing but a god of
[1:27:16] the message
[1:27:19] where's the foolish virgin coming from
[1:27:21] musician
[1:27:23] think on these things
[1:27:26] mental faith
[1:27:32] mental faith
[1:27:37] did you say What God Says
[1:27:43] it's just confess the way God said it
[1:27:47] huh
[1:27:55] little note says it's
[1:27:57] the cake for Nanny between the services
[1:28:01] okay
[1:28:03] all right
[1:28:05] between the services don't go get it now
[1:28:10] let's stand and think about it
[1:28:14] if our mental faith if we don't have
[1:28:16] that first we don't have anything it's
[1:28:18] got to be mental faith
[1:28:20] right but then it's got to become a
[1:28:22] spiritual revelation
[1:28:26] of substance
[1:28:31] what do we think about it
[1:28:35] all right
[1:28:36] okay
[1:28:37] testimony one of your order or somewhere
[1:28:40] where you can be in here
[1:28:43] pray pray with me that I get through
[1:28:45] what I want to say
[1:28:48] I was battling this morning in my mind
[1:28:51] and Sunday School
[1:28:53] and here when I first got in here
[1:28:55] and I had such a foggy headache
[1:28:58] I went to a funeral yesterday was a
[1:29:00] girlfriend's mother I'm waiting on the
[1:29:03] phone call from back home my second mom
[1:29:06] my sister Gibby felt something and she
[1:29:09] wrote me a note
[1:29:10] and told me that she loved me I reached
[1:29:13] over
[1:29:14] and I took her hand to thank her
[1:29:17] in such a peace and a calm
[1:29:22] just engulfed me right then and I'm
[1:29:24] sharing this because
[1:29:26] the Lord pays attention to the littlest
[1:29:30] details in our lives
[1:29:32] thank you for listening
[1:29:34] he pays attention to the small
[1:29:37] he doesn't but he died
[1:29:40] go ahead six to one six you might have a
[1:29:43] name well I'm saying but just a verse
[1:29:45] and then we got to go all right Jesus is
[1:30:23] sisters
[1:30:25] all of you that can get out and come up
[1:30:27] here
[1:30:29] our sister's got a problem
[1:30:36] but you know what a lot of times our
[1:30:38] problems is
[1:30:40] we think we're by herself we think we're
[1:30:42] the only one going through anything or
[1:30:44] you know nobody's having problems
[1:30:47] we got them all
[1:30:50] but everybody's got problems everybody's
[1:30:53] got troubles
[1:30:54] and everybody is faced problems and
[1:30:57] troubles you need something that you can
[1:30:59] see
[1:31:02] something that you can see yourself
[1:31:05] and realize that you're not by yourself
[1:31:13] see we can pray to cast something off
[1:31:16] and we believe in that
[1:31:19] but you know what the greatest ability
[1:31:22] to conquer an enemy
[1:31:25] is love
[1:31:29] prior is one thing and we believe in it
[1:31:31] we're going to pray but love
[1:31:34] is the greatest conquering enemy that
[1:31:37] the devil has got I mean it conquers him
[1:31:40] it's the love of mine run around and
[1:31:42] said I'd rather see love in a church
[1:31:45] than to see 5 000 people healed
[1:31:51] thank you
[1:31:53] and on oh Lord what what are you saying
[1:31:57] he said because if Love Comes we're
[1:32:00] going to see 10 000 heal
[1:32:04] I thought love the greatest Force could
[1:32:08] ever be
[1:32:09] is the love of God it'll conquer all
[1:32:13] enemies
[1:32:15] for you don't worry
[1:32:18] you see
[1:32:20] the love that people have
[1:32:23] you're not alone
[1:32:26] don't ever think you're by yourself and
[1:32:28] no
[1:32:29] just remember everybody's praying for
[1:32:31] you
[1:32:32] and the love of God is going to move
[1:32:35] into our sister's life
[1:32:39] to pray for and believe
[1:32:42] we're going to an owner with what we're
[1:32:44] going to pray for her because that's
[1:32:45] what the Bible says
[1:32:54] right exactly
[1:33:01] I want you to take this and I want you
[1:33:04] to put it on you
[1:33:06] these sisters will tell you you know
[1:33:09] keep that with you
[1:33:12] and believe that everybody here is
[1:33:15] praying over that Little Falls and
[1:33:18] that's what it means that needs
[1:33:19] everybody here is one mind and we're
[1:33:22] believing it and we're going to ask God
[1:33:25] to cast that demon away from you because
[1:33:28] it's not you it's not you
[1:33:31] hold on sickness is not a person is what
[1:33:35] Satan brings on to us
[1:33:36] and we're not against you that's the
[1:33:39] point that we understand
[1:33:41] but let's believe father
[1:33:44] in the name of Jesus Christ we lay our
[1:33:48] hands upon our sister believing with all
[1:33:51] of these sisters that are standing
[1:33:52] around to show their love their concern
[1:33:56] and their thoughts for our sisters let
[1:33:59] her know that she's not by herself let
[1:34:02] her know that she has a group of sisters
[1:34:04] it's all in harmony with her in the love
[1:34:08] of Jesus Christ
[1:34:10] father let her know that God is real
[1:34:14] in leading into all things
[1:34:21] these sisters are joined together
[1:34:25] and that's the one thing you cannot
[1:34:28] handle is the love it would even be in
[1:34:31] the natural
[1:34:49] in the name of Jesus Christ we condemn
[1:34:53] you Satan
[1:34:54] you just might as well move on
[1:34:57] because God is real we love you in Jesus
[1:35:02] name amen do you believe it
[1:35:05] you believe it then you just believe it
[1:35:10] love is the greatest conqueror
[1:35:14] of Satan
