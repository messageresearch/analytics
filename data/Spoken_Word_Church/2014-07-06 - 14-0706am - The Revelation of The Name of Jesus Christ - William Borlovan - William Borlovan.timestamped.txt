[4:36] who is there for my countenance
[5:15] amen joy unspeakable and full of glory
[5:19] wonderful day and good to see everybody
[5:22] house of the Lord you be seated for a
[5:24] second brother Ryan wants to kind of
[5:25] update us on where the little girl he is
[5:28] they've had to put her in to eccleston
[5:30] hospital so he can kind of upgraders and
[5:33] let us know do it and keep remember for
[5:35] sister Mary used to be Gabriel that your
[5:39] eyes are doing better so we appreciate
[5:41] that thank God for doing that first off
[5:47] I just want to thank everybody for their
[5:49] prayers for those who haven't heard
[5:50] maybe you became around midnight
[5:52] Wednesday night so thank you all and she
[5:56] got here everything normal and well with
[5:58] Gabe being the baby shortly after the
[6:01] delivery though they determined that her
[6:02] lungs weren't fully developed and she's
[6:04] slightly premature so they kept her in
[6:08] the NICU at Northeast Georgia now as of
[6:11] last night they said there's nothing
[6:13] else they can do for because you know
[6:15] she's just not improving with all their
[6:17] machines and things they've reached
[6:18] their limit so they sent her to
[6:20] eggleston Children's Hospital in Atlanta
[6:22] and there's a lot more that can do for
[6:26] their the outlook is really good and so
[6:30] I just want y'all to continue to
[6:31] remember her in prayer the reason I
[6:32] wanted to get up here and say this
[6:34] though is to show the devil that he's
[6:36] conquered because what I've seen
[6:38] throughout this I keep seeing the same
[6:41] thing daddy and I were talking on the
[6:43] way back from Northeast Georgia won one
[6:46] of the visits that we had with IVA and I
[6:50] said you know fear hath torment
[6:52] I told Gaby I said this is just torment
[6:54] it's tearing me to pieces inside I'm a
[6:56] human you know and so I thought of that
[7:01] scripture and I said Gaby we've got to
[7:03] have faith because faith is the
[7:05] counterpart to fear you know with faith
[7:08] we can you know God can work through
[7:10] faith but the devil works through fear
[7:12] and he holds us down with that so that
[7:14] was number one number two there was
[7:17] another instance where I'll just tore up
[7:19] last night the Bible study that's the
[7:21] first time I broke down during this
[7:22] because I had been looking at those
[7:24] machines in that room too much and
[7:27] looking at the circumstances
[7:29] and watching my baby curtain you know I
[7:32] gotta quit looking at the circumstances
[7:34] but so that's what was happening with me
[7:37] last night I began to worry too much and
[7:39] brother Wade said quit worrying and I
[7:43] believe that and I accept it that was
[7:45] number two of that same thing there's
[7:47] you know three is a witness the third
[7:49] one this morning about three o'clock in
[7:51] the morning at Egleston Children's
[7:52] Hospital i was doing my daily Bible
[7:54] reading just waiting on the doctor to
[7:56] come talk to us didn't go out of my way
[7:59] to find this scripture and I came across
[8:00] that very first fear hath torment number
[8:03] three okay three is a witness and that's
[8:06] the lesson I think God wants me to see
[8:08] out of this no matter what the outcome
[8:10] of this or any situation there's never a
[8:12] reason to worry you know you look back
[8:15] when have you ever looked back after a
[8:17] hard time a hard trial and said boy I'm
[8:19] glad I worried that really helped me a
[8:21] lot that's what got me through was all
[8:23] the worry no matter what there's never
[8:26] reason to fear so cast it down and
[8:29] that's that's really all the one to say
[8:31] just keep remembering Ava's she'll be
[8:32] fine
[8:38] where I stand together that have our
[8:41] brother back there with us and we always
[8:43] say yeah thank you for visitor come here
[8:46] one time your visitor two times you're
[8:47] part of us so just pray that the Lord
[8:50] would would bless you and be with you
[8:52] brother al said tell me yesterday that
[8:55] his mother came through the operation
[8:57] fine everything is great greater than
[9:00] what they even talked about it could be
[9:02] and she wound up with a little smaller
[9:04] spot that they thought they were gonna
[9:06] have to do a whole lot of work and you
[9:09] know it would be just it was just a
[9:11] small spot so you know just keep praying
[9:14] for her mr. Lord would be with it yeah
[9:18] we just done requested brother sister
[9:20] Mary the sister Mary dougherty is back
[9:22] in the hospital
[9:22] so remember her remember why she will be
[9:25] going the Lord willing and some time in
[9:28] August for her knee operation so we just
[9:31] keep praying that the Lord would bless
[9:32] and take care of everything you know
[9:34] doing that going because that's that's
[9:37] what we need right all hearts are clear
[9:39] we're ready to sister sister to see
[9:46] cutter hand yesterday and she didn't go
[9:49] to the doctor you know but wound up
[9:51] today having to go to the doctor with it
[9:54] so remember it's just a freitas sister
[9:56] remember that okay everybody ready to
[9:59] hear the word of the Lord
[10:00] no let's just sing open the eyes of my
[10:02] heart as brother William Moore Levon
[10:04] comes to speak the word of the Lord unto
[10:06] us don't we believe it right faith
[10:08] cometh by hearing hearing by the word of
[10:11] the Lord Amen open the eyes of my
[10:23] and you seem to do an hour
[10:35] the eyes of my
[11:43] Amen god bless each and every one of you
[11:45] again it's so wonderful to be announce
[11:47] to the Lord this morning it's good to
[11:49] see everyone gonna fight y'all faces and
[11:51] like brother Dale said one time I guess
[11:54] second time family and I certainly feel
[11:56] that way I appreciate all that all the
[11:58] hospitality that I've shown and brother
[12:01] lay there and sister June and all of
[12:03] y'all we appreciate it so very much it's
[12:06] something because when he when he
[12:07] fellowship with a bride no matter where
[12:09] you go everybody's the same the true
[12:11] bride is the same no matter where you go
[12:13] because we all have the same father you
[12:15] know and I appreciate brother Ryan's
[12:17] testimony and his stand you know when
[12:21] our son Elijah was born he it was it was
[12:24] just a normal delivery and everything
[12:26] but I can kind understand what he's
[12:29] going through as far as because when he
[12:31] hit a trial the Satan will work on your
[12:34] emotions he'll work on your emotions and
[12:37] he'll use them emotions against you when
[12:39] our son was born my wife you know she
[12:42] got a little feverish they gave her
[12:44] medicine for the fever
[12:45] well then through the breast milk and
[12:47] somehow transfer to him and when he had
[12:50] a fever they started pumping with
[12:51] antibiotics and we ended up being in the
[12:53] hospital for several days you know got
[12:55] to put a little stint in his arm you
[12:58] know and it's hard it's hard and then
[13:00] you know when when the stuff like that
[13:02] happens it's just a normal trial and God
[13:05] is in control as our brother said he is
[13:07] in control and you know brother Graham
[13:09] said if I knew I was gonna die tomorrow
[13:11] morning what good would fear do fear has
[13:14] no virtue just like he said you know but
[13:17] he said faith can deliver me and God is
[13:20] in control and we appreciate that we
[13:22] appreciate that he knows all things and
[13:25] Satan cannot do nothing without God's
[13:28] allowance
[13:29] he couldn't even touch Joe without God
[13:31] allowing it so remember that all of our
[13:34] trials are for a reason we want to
[13:36] remember all these other requests
[13:39] because Satan is like a roaring lion but
[13:41] our God is in control because what when
[13:43] the enemy comes in like a flood the
[13:44] Spirit of God raises up a standard
[13:46] against it and he'll be right there
[13:48] because it's not our battle
[13:50] it's his battle you know the key is to
[13:53] give our battle to him because he's the
[13:56] great general amen he's the great
[13:58] general we appreciated that Bible
[14:00] studies so much last night I mean how
[14:01] many - preciate of that you know we're
[14:03] talking last night about when God
[14:05] forgives he forgets and that's called
[14:08] justification you are justified before
[14:11] God himself so say and we'll use the
[14:14] five senses of our spirit like our
[14:16] memory and he'll bring that and use that
[14:19] against us but we have got to remember
[14:21] and remind him that we are forgiven and
[14:24] forgotten and only God can do that
[14:27] you know the Prophet himself he he you
[14:30] know he confessed he said you do some
[14:32] wrong against me I'll forgive you but I
[14:33] won't forget because we're human and
[14:35] when it happens it happens but he said
[14:37] only God can forgive and forget and
[14:40] that's most important thing is to be
[14:42] justified in eyes of God amen
[14:44] praise God we appreciate I appreciate
[14:45] every one of you my wife sends her
[14:47] greetings she really wanted to be here
[14:48] the little kid he's caught a little cold
[14:50] and it would've been a little hard on
[14:52] him
[14:53] and everything but she sends her
[14:54] greetings and wishes she was also here
[14:57] let's turn lets go to the Bibles to
[15:00] Deuteronomy chapter 16
[15:09] start verse one
[15:17] word of Lord says observe the month of
[15:19] Abib and keep the Passover unto the Lord
[15:23] thy God for in the month of abiud the
[15:25] lower thy God brought thee forth out of
[15:27] Egypt by night thou shalt therefore
[15:30] sacrifice to pass over unto the Lord thy
[15:32] God of the flock of the herd in the
[15:34] place which the Lord shall choose to
[15:38] place his name there that's how he no
[15:41] leavened bread with it seven days shalt
[15:43] thou eat unleavened bread therewith even
[15:45] the bread of affliction for thou camest
[15:47] forth out of the land of Egypt and hast
[15:48] that thou mayst remember the day when
[15:51] now Came us forth out of the land of
[15:52] Egypt all the days of my life and there
[15:55] shall be no leavened bread seen with
[15:57] thee in all thy coasts seven days
[15:58] neither shall there anything of the
[16:00] flesh which they sacrificed at the first
[16:02] day at even remain all night until the
[16:05] morning
[16:05] thou may it's not sacrificed a passover
[16:08] within any of thy gates which the LORD
[16:09] thy God giveth thee but at the place
[16:12] which the LORD thy God shall choose to
[16:15] place his name in there thou shalt
[16:19] sacrifice the Passover at even at the
[16:22] going down of the Sun at the at the
[16:25] going down of the Sun at the season that
[16:27] thou camest forth out of Egypt thou
[16:29] shalt roast and eat it in the place
[16:31] which the LORD thy God shall choose and
[16:33] I shall turn in the morning and go into
[16:36] thy tents amen let's bow our heads
[16:38] before we see the DeMars gracious
[16:40] Heavenly Father we're so thankful to you
[16:42] for your word with so thankful to you
[16:43] for your spirit we're so thankful to you
[16:45] for your mercy Lord and how mindful you
[16:47] are father Lord you said not a single
[16:50] sparrow falls without you knowing about
[16:51] it father and he said aren't you so much
[16:53] more than the sparrows father you know
[16:55] intimately what each and every one of us
[16:57] have need of this morning I pray O God
[17:00] that you helped me father just yield
[17:01] myself that you Father God with we may
[17:04] all be of service to you father we love
[17:06] you Lord we commit ourselves into your
[17:07] hands in Jesus Christ name Amen amen god
[17:10] bless you see you this morning I want to
[17:14] speak this morning with the help of the
[17:17] Lord on the revelation of the name of
[17:20] Jesus Christ and the importance of that
[17:24] name because as we read the text there
[17:26] several towns like two or three times
[17:29] God
[17:30] tells Moses that there's only one place
[17:34] where God will accept worship in the
[17:36] place where God chooses to put his name
[17:39] and we live in a day and in an age when
[17:43] anything goes there's no wrong as they
[17:47] say they don't want to be told no they
[17:51] don't want restrictions they call it you
[17:53] only live once
[17:54] and that's live the devil because there
[17:59] is that people like worldly people like
[18:02] the idea and the sinful nature of man
[18:04] likes the idea of living any way they
[18:06] want to and not having an answer for it
[18:09] they don't like the idea of
[18:11] responsibility they like the idea of
[18:13] living a sinful life being cremated
[18:15] scattered to the four winds of the earth
[18:17] and that's it that's that's what they
[18:20] think but it doesn't matter how many
[18:22] wins they're scattered to they will rise
[18:24] on the day of judgment and give a count
[18:26] for what they did so we live like I said
[18:30] in an age where people where anything
[18:32] goes and if you feel it do it that's a
[18:36] lie from the pits of hell because our
[18:38] first nature were born with we naturally
[18:42] do wrong do you know brother Branham say
[18:44] that Jesus was sinless by nature we're
[18:48] sinful by Nature
[18:49] no one has got to teach us to tell a lie
[18:52] no one has got to teach us to do wrong
[18:54] and no one had to teach Jesus to do
[18:58] right so the only way that we can become
[19:02] sinless is through Jesus Christ without
[19:06] that we're sin and we're sinners by
[19:07] Nature it doesn't matter if you're
[19:10] raised in the message in a godly home
[19:13] and you've never drank a drop of liquor
[19:15] in your life you're still a sinner the
[19:18] fact that you're born and coming to the
[19:21] world and breathe your first breath
[19:22] you're born and sin shaped in iniquity
[19:25] and you come to the world speaking lies
[19:26] and we need a Savior every single one of
[19:30] us so God has a certain requirement and
[19:33] he requires and he wants to be
[19:35] worshipped in a certain way and that is
[19:40] God's only provided way of worship
[19:43] you know they had these things that you
[19:45] see everywhere now these bumper stickers
[19:46] you might have seen them says coexist
[19:48] and each each each letter is made of a
[19:51] different religious symbol that's
[19:53] exactly what's happening they're wanting
[19:55] everyone to coexist but it's impossible
[19:58] it is impossible for everyone to
[20:00] co-exist like that so you have all these
[20:04] you know it's there's more find your
[20:07] path of enlightenment whatever makes you
[20:10] a better person
[20:11] that is what as long as we all get to
[20:14] one spot as long as you're a better
[20:16] neighbor it doesn't matter how you get
[20:18] there that's a lot that because see if
[20:21] say n can just muddle the waters he's
[20:25] got you people think that Satan don't
[20:27] want you going to church people when
[20:30] they are in church and in a religious
[20:33] form he's got you because when
[20:37] somebody's a sinner they can be under
[20:39] conviction and realize they're sinner
[20:40] but when someone is religious then it's
[20:44] hard Ram said that the religious spear
[20:46] is the hardest one to cast out a
[20:48] religious spirit because when someone is
[20:51] religious and has a religious spirit
[20:53] they think they're right and it can't be
[20:55] told otherwise unless God through God
[20:57] really has mercy on him so it's
[21:01] important that we have a personal
[21:03] relationship with Jesus Christ so god
[21:06] only accepts Jesus Christ he is the only
[21:11] he is the only accepted one so if we
[21:14] want to be accepted we've got to be in
[21:15] the accepted one so that is God's chosen
[21:19] place of worship we find in a very
[21:21] beginning in the book of Genesis we have
[21:24] a perfect example of Cain and Abel they
[21:26] both brought sacrifices and God accepted
[21:29] Abel's and refused Cain's now Cain
[21:34] didn't have a revelation like Abel did
[21:36] but God in His mercy even told Cain you
[21:39] do it as your brother and you'll be
[21:40] accepted God even broke it down to Cain
[21:43] on what to do and Cain came with God you
[21:48] accept it take it or leave it attitude
[21:50] and God left it God lets it
[21:55] so if we come with the attitude of Lord
[21:58] how do you want me to worship you where
[22:00] will I be accepted that God reveals it
[22:03] to you he will reveal to you his chosen
[22:08] place of worship because in the Bible
[22:10] there he says God says where I choose to
[22:13] put my name not where just where the
[22:16] name where you think the name should go
[22:18] he said where I choose to put my name
[22:21] because we find in the Old Testament
[22:23] every single feast day every single
[22:26] holiday absolutely everything pointed to
[22:28] Jesus Christ and He fulfilled every bit
[22:31] of it all the shadows all the types all
[22:35] the prophets were a part of Jesus and
[22:37] they were moved by the Holy Ghost to act
[22:40] in their lives and to do certain things
[22:42] by the Holy Ghost to reflect Jesus and
[22:45] they no doubt didn't necessarily know
[22:47] what they were doing but it was the Holy
[22:48] Ghost each prophet revealed apart each
[22:52] prophet revealed the lure part it was
[22:54] coming clear as it came on down closer
[22:56] to the manifestation of the Son of God
[22:58] it became clearer and clearer and
[22:59] clearer until there was God in flesh and
[23:02] he was absolutely everything that he
[23:05] that the Bible spoke of him you know
[23:07] last night in Bible study we're talking
[23:09] about when he when he beat all the money
[23:10] changers and things out of the temple
[23:12] you know even that the Old Testament
[23:13] prophesied that Mazda the seal of my
[23:15] house has eaten me up so he had to
[23:18] fulfill the scripture even down to the
[23:21] absolute letter he had to fulfill the
[23:23] scripture he had to die before they can
[23:26] go break his bones because that was the
[23:28] natural practice was to break the bones
[23:30] that the legs that would be the final
[23:32] thing but he had to die before that
[23:34] because that's what the scripture said
[23:35] and not one scripture can be broken so
[23:40] we find through the process of time
[23:41] throughout the Old Testament as he would
[23:43] lay his word down and he was coming and
[23:45] constantly just given a little shadow of
[23:47] what it was to come he was revealing
[23:50] himself in part when Jacob he wrestled
[23:53] with Almighty God and he asked the angel
[23:57] which was God himself in flesh a man he
[23:59] asked the angel what his name was but it
[24:02] wasn't ready to give that name yes he
[24:04] said why do you want to know my name
[24:06] Moses at the burning bush
[24:08] he came and he met with God himself and
[24:12] he asked him he said when they when I go
[24:15] into Egypt and try and deliver and
[24:16] they're gonna ask me who sent you who
[24:18] well what do I say he said tell them
[24:20] that I am that I am sent you I am that I
[24:25] am and we know that was Jesus Christ but
[24:27] that wasn't the name of God I am right
[24:29] it was a brother man talks about the
[24:31] unveiling of God how God changed his
[24:33] form because Jesus when he came he said
[24:37] before Abraham was I am
[24:39] in the book of Hebrews you have Paul
[24:42] talking about Moses and he said that
[24:45] Moses esteemed the riches of Christ more
[24:49] than the treasures of Egypt so Moute so
[24:52] Paul had the revelation that the burning
[24:53] bush was Jesus because Paul said that
[24:56] Moses esteemed the riches of Christ more
[25:00] than those of Egypt and Moses met God in
[25:05] the form of I am but it was still giving
[25:09] a little more part out he was given a
[25:11] little more part out and the message
[25:14] God's chosen place of worship brother
[25:18] Branham said here now in he what is his
[25:22] name first we'll have to name find what
[25:25] God's name is before we can find what it
[25:28] is he's putting in the place now we find
[25:30] out that he had many titles he is called
[25:33] the he was called father which is a
[25:34] title he's called son which is a title
[25:36] he's called the Holy Ghost which is a
[25:37] title he was called Rosa Sharron which
[25:39] is a title lily-of-the-valley a title
[25:41] Morningstar Jehovah Jireh Jehovah a57
[25:45] compound different compound redemptive
[25:48] names all of them were titles none of
[25:51] them were names we're talking about
[25:53] where God chooses to put his name that
[25:55] is his accepted and provided way of
[25:57] worship he said but he has a name when
[26:01] he met Moses he had not a name yet he
[26:03] told Moses I am that I am and we see
[26:06] Jesus and when we see Jesus on earth
[26:07] speaking in Hebrews the sixth chapter I
[26:09] beg your pardon Saint John the six he
[26:11] said I am that I am
[26:13] they said why you're not a man over 50
[26:15] years old and say that you seen Abraham
[26:16] he said before Abraham was I am
[26:19] and I am was the one the burning bush
[26:22] the pillar of fire that was in the
[26:24] burning bush back in the days of Moses
[26:25] the I am the I am when he would meet
[26:29] with the prophets he'd say I am the God
[26:31] of Abraham Isaac and Jacob now Abraham
[26:34] Isaac and Jacob in the flesh died
[26:36] hundreds of years ago but he the Bible
[26:39] also said that he's not a God of the of
[26:41] the dead he's a God of the living when
[26:44] he said I am that's present tense
[26:47] because God changes his form he was God
[26:52] above us in the pillar of fire he was
[26:55] God with us in his son Jesus Christ and
[26:58] now he's got in us he brings it more
[27:00] personal you remember brother Branham
[27:03] talked about that he loved his wife so
[27:05] much he said sometimes I wish I could
[27:06] just pull her inside of me but he can't
[27:08] do that but God loved us so much that he
[27:12] wanted to live in us not with us wasn't
[27:16] good enough
[27:17] he wanted to live in us and lead us and
[27:21] guide us into all truth only God can
[27:23] come down and live in someone else we
[27:25] can't do it we cannot do it but God
[27:29] condescended himself because Christ is
[27:32] the mystery of God revealed all the
[27:35] mattre buttes all all the love that was
[27:38] then God from the beginning he poured
[27:39] into Christ Jesus Christ was an absolute
[27:42] expression of what God was when he'd
[27:44] seen Jesus walking you seen God walking
[27:47] but you didn't know it unless God
[27:49] revealed it to you so remember Jesus was
[27:54] God's chosen place of worship you know
[27:58] we find that even and it was Gideon when
[28:00] he was there and God was coming down and
[28:01] he was calling him and then an angel
[28:03] came forth and he told him down mighty
[28:05] man of Valor and Gideon said if God be
[28:08] witness and where's all the miracles so
[28:10] you see God seen a mighty man of Valor
[28:13] Gideon said all these Philistines around
[28:15] us where's the mighty man of what you
[28:17] know if God be with us where's all the
[28:18] miracles but God said you know be a good
[28:22] courage thou mighty man of Valor and an
[28:25] angel of God brother M said it was God
[28:26] in flesh again came to him and Gideon
[28:29] also wanted to know his name but he
[28:32] didn't tell him
[28:33] he didn't tell him his name because it
[28:34] wasn't the time for that manifestation
[28:36] yet because God was still dealing in
[28:39] parts he was still letting out a little
[28:42] bit letting out a little bit making
[28:43] himself known because remember
[28:46] everything as it was everything was
[28:48] coming in part and Jesus Christ was the
[28:51] capstone of the whole thing he was he
[28:53] was the very embodiment of God himself
[28:56] and spiritually I want to think
[28:59] spiritually this morning that all the
[29:00] church ages had a word in part but when
[29:03] the fullness comes is Jesus Christ made
[29:06] manifest again the same thing because
[29:08] you see that the ephesian church age
[29:11] would brother Graham said was a Garden
[29:12] of Eden all over again you see the
[29:15] Garden of Eden started Eve compromised
[29:17] on the word come out to the process of
[29:20] time God capped off in Jesus Christ
[29:22] there was a fullness ephesian church age
[29:25] all over again
[29:27] they started compromising on the word
[29:29] they left their first love of the word
[29:31] they came on up and there it is again in
[29:35] his fullness Christ in the bride oneness
[29:40] brother Graham said also in God's chosen
[29:43] place of worship
[29:45] he said now we find out that Jesus said
[29:49] also I come and my father's name and he
[29:52] received me not then the name of the
[29:54] Father must be Jesus that's right
[29:58] the name of the father's Jesus because
[30:00] jesus said so I carry my father's name I
[30:03] come in my father's name and he received
[30:06] me not then his name was Jesus and
[30:10] Gabriel called him Jesus the prophets
[30:13] called him Jesus and he was absolutely
[30:14] Jesus before his birth even the holy
[30:18] prophet called his name Emmanuel which
[30:20] is God with us then God was manifested
[30:22] in the flesh in order to take away the
[30:24] sin of the world and in doing so he was
[30:26] given the name of Jesus so Jesus is the
[30:29] name and the name was placed in a man
[30:32] not a church not a denomination not a
[30:36] Creed but a man he chose to place his
[30:39] name in Jesus Christ now we find out
[30:42] then that he becomes God's place of
[30:44] worship where you worship Him
[30:46] ever before he was born his name was
[30:49] called Jesus it was so important it was
[30:51] gift to his mother by the angel Gabriel
[30:53] that his name would be called Jesus the
[30:55] Son of God what he was so after this
[30:59] time now it's time for God to fully
[31:01] reveal his name in Jesus Christ and this
[31:04] message if you get anything out of the
[31:08] message as a whole other than Jesus
[31:11] Christ you've missed it because this
[31:13] message points you to Jesus Christ
[31:15] this message is Jesus Christ and I pray
[31:18] that God will in your in your soul so
[31:22] fabricate the Bible and the message
[31:23] together that it will even together can
[31:25] never be separated because then
[31:27] intellectualism and reasoning will have
[31:29] no place because you can't you know like
[31:33] I said the message is a manifestation of
[31:36] the Bible so God must be worshiped in
[31:41] the right way it's not a set of rules
[31:43] it's not theology it's not a rules of
[31:47] do's and dont's is get to Jesus and he
[31:49] takes care of everything else and Jesus
[31:53] is the word so when Jesus when God was
[31:56] manifested in Jesus Christ the priests
[31:58] are still trying to worship Him
[32:00] according to the law of Moses and that
[32:02] was sin because Jesus God's chose the
[32:06] place of worship was right there in
[32:08] Palestine and Nazareth going around that
[32:10] was God's chosen place of worship so we
[32:14] must know and understand where God's
[32:16] chose a place of worship is it's always
[32:19] in Jesus but remember that Jesus is the
[32:22] word and God's chosen place of worship
[32:26] was to be in that Ark at one time and
[32:29] Noah's Ark you had to be there to be
[32:31] saved that was so to speak that was
[32:33] God's chosen place of safety of worship
[32:35] but the Ark is in Jesus Christ the art
[32:37] is a type of Jesus Christ so when the
[32:40] fulfillment of that shadow cane that was
[32:42] God's chosen place of worship so it
[32:44] didn't really change and what it was it
[32:46] just changed in the dispensation because
[32:48] there's a word allotted for each and
[32:51] every age that God allots
[32:54] and that's where God shows a place of
[32:57] worship is
[32:58] because we want to find out what Jesus
[33:00] is doing right now we don't want a God
[33:02] of history we want to lift him up out of
[33:04] history because in any church anyone
[33:07] that claims to serve God that packs a
[33:10] Bible can say that Jesus raised from the
[33:12] dead but they think of him as a
[33:13] historical sense we know Jesus Christ
[33:17] have now that heals the babies that
[33:20] heals that heals the young heals the old
[33:24] that's the God that we know now we
[33:26] appreciate what God did but what's he
[33:28] doing what is he up to we need to have a
[33:32] personal relationship with him so God
[33:36] must be worshiped in the right way you
[33:39] all know the story of this hair
[33:41] Phoenician woman when she came to Jesus
[33:44] there was a woman in the Bible she was a
[33:46] Gentile and Jesus was sitting there at
[33:49] the table and she approaches Jesus
[33:52] because she needs something her daughter
[33:54] needed some help and she approached
[33:56] Jesus and she said thou son of David
[33:58] have mercy my daughter she's grievously
[34:00] vexed with the devil and do you know
[34:02] what Jesus said to her the God the giver
[34:05] of every good thing the Prince of Peace
[34:07] the God of all love he said it's not
[34:09] meat for me to take the bread and give
[34:11] it to the dogs but then look what she
[34:15] did she didn't go off and run off and
[34:18] just you know and blaspheme
[34:20] she said it's true Lord but the dogs eat
[34:23] the crumbs that are swept from the
[34:25] Masters table and then when she
[34:27] approached him in the right way she got
[34:31] what she wanted because it's important
[34:33] to know that he was son of David to the
[34:37] Jews but not to the Gentiles so to try
[34:40] and approach Jesus the Sarah Phoenician
[34:43] woman as the son of David did not work
[34:45] because he was to the Jews the son of
[34:48] David
[34:49] blind bartimaeus he was blind and he's
[34:51] seen him going and he said thou son of
[34:53] David have mercy on me and that pulled
[34:56] that faith Jesus had no way of hearing
[34:57] him through the crowd all the uproar but
[35:00] Jesus felt the faith that he had in his
[35:03] heart and he pulled he touched the he
[35:06] touched the hem of His garment by faith
[35:08] he pulled on that gift in God and Jesus
[35:11] around and he said what will you do that
[35:13] you know what is it that you would that
[35:15] I do for you he said that I may receive
[35:16] my sight and he got his sight he said
[35:20] son of David but that but the Seraphin
[35:22] asian woman had to had to approach him
[35:23] in the right way he comes as in three
[35:31] ways and as the son of man son of God
[35:37] and Son of David son of man was when he
[35:43] was made manifest in flesh in Jesus
[35:45] Christ he was the son of man he kept
[35:47] saying the son of man must do this that
[35:49] you know the I the son of man who do you
[35:52] say that I the Son of Man am then he
[35:56] they killed the son of man because God
[35:57] cannot be killed and God is a spirit so
[35:59] he had to be manifested in the flesh to
[36:01] be crucified so he can suffer for us so
[36:07] after they crucified the Son of man he
[36:10] died he was buried and he raised again
[36:12] and he came in the office of the son of
[36:15] God and he became the Holy Ghost because
[36:19] remember in the beginning God was the
[36:22] pillar of fire in the Old Testament and
[36:25] all he did was he changed his mask all
[36:27] he did was he changed his form into
[36:30] something else the same God that was
[36:33] with Abraham that met him under the oak
[36:35] tree and discerned the thoughts of
[36:36] Sarah's hearts was the same God that was
[36:38] a pillar of fire
[36:39] it was the same God that came in Jesus
[36:41] Christ all he did was he changed his
[36:43] form you know brother when he talks
[36:46] about like the drama you know I'm not
[36:48] old enough to be a grandfather yet but
[36:50] all of you brothers that are for example
[36:51] or sisters for grandmother brother Dale
[36:55] here he's a grandfather he's a father
[36:58] and his son he's all three you know but
[37:04] but but his sister there doesn't have
[37:07] claims on him that's her husband but
[37:12] that's not her father
[37:13] but brother Dale is the same man so you
[37:16] see how all he does is whenever his
[37:18] grandkids come and he's happy to see him
[37:20] and he goes fishing with them he steps
[37:21] into the role of grandfather
[37:24] but he's still father whenever brother
[37:28] weight comes that's his son
[37:30] but it's still the same in he just
[37:33] changes his role but it's all the time
[37:36] brother Dale is still Jesus Jehovah the
[37:41] Old Testament is Jesus of the new right
[37:44] so that is why and it's amazing because
[37:47] the doctrine of the Godhead is fought so
[37:50] hard against and as we come along I pray
[37:53] that the Lord will just quicken to where
[37:55] you understand why it's all about the
[37:57] name because God's chosen place of
[37:59] worship is where he puts the name so if
[38:02] Satan can deceive the world and to
[38:04] believe in that each three he's got him
[38:06] it doesn't matter how many churches they
[38:08] build he's got him because Father Son
[38:13] and Holy Ghost earn our names so we find
[38:15] that he's son of man when he became
[38:16] manifested he's son of God throughout
[38:19] the church ages as the Holy Ghost and
[38:21] he's going to be son of David in the
[38:22] Millennium amen
[38:23] there's a little secret that comes in
[38:26] there Luke seventeen thirty even thus
[38:32] shall a be and the coming of when the
[38:35] Son of Man is revealed again it's just a
[38:37] secret let's go to the unveiling of God
[38:44] remember because if you're still trying
[38:46] to worship Him as son of God as a God of
[38:51] what he did back in Luther's day you
[38:53] missed it he sent up man again and the
[38:59] unveiling of God we'll start with 68
[39:05] notice now he came first as prophet and
[39:09] they crucified him his own crucified him
[39:11] he came as the son of man then after the
[39:15] Holy Spirit came he was then the son of
[39:17] God God is a spirit he was the holy
[39:20] spirit son of God he lived through the
[39:22] church ages as son of God now in the
[39:25] Millenium he'll be son of David sitting
[39:27] upon the throne of his father David he
[39:30] is the son of David now he says and it
[39:31] says and remember between the son of God
[39:33] in the latest year church age they put
[39:36] him out
[39:37] and in Luke that's Luke 1730 he said he
[39:41] would be revealed again as the son of
[39:43] man the Prophet fulfilling the rest of
[39:46] it see the Scriptures tied together
[39:48] perfectly son of man son of God son of
[39:52] David what was it it was the same God
[39:54] all the time just changing his form in
[39:57] Marfa just change it it's a great drama
[40:00] to him he's acting it out because I said
[40:04] in each church age he's got a word that
[40:06] is allotted for each generation to keep
[40:08] the elect peer then he said for his acts
[40:12] he changes his form then he came the
[40:14] form of the Son of Man for the reformers
[40:17] age Wesley Luther and all down through
[40:19] then we find out that they got it so
[40:21] bundled up just like the Israelites did
[40:23] - when he does appear in the last days
[40:25] in the Pentecostal age as the Holy
[40:26] Spirit they reject it they did the same
[40:29] thing Israel did so what does he do now
[40:32] return a son of men and then from that
[40:35] son of David he said see how close we
[40:38] are
[40:39] and I want to point out something very
[40:41] interesting is that when Jesus came
[40:43] manifested as a first as the son of man
[40:45] the first time they crucified the Son of
[40:48] Man we're at the second crucifixion of
[40:50] Jesus Christ again in the office of the
[40:52] son of man because history repeats
[40:55] itself it's the same spirits history
[40:59] repeats itself so he is now revealing
[41:04] himself in the form of the Son of Man in
[41:06] the flesh of his bride amen and the
[41:09] flesh of his bride doing the exact same
[41:11] works doing the exact same things God
[41:15] promised he would do it God promised he
[41:18] would do it because in the Old Testament
[41:20] God was always veiled he was always
[41:24] hidden brother Graham said when the
[41:27] pillar fire went behind that veil and
[41:28] the Old Testament it wasn't seen again
[41:30] until on the road to Damascus when it
[41:32] struck Paul Saul who was then sawed off
[41:35] his horse
[41:36] so once the pillar fire went behind the
[41:38] veil of old badger skins it still took
[41:41] faith to believe that he was still there
[41:42] because of God because God requires
[41:45] faith no matter what age you live in you
[41:50] find in the Old Testament
[41:51] I was behind the veil of badger skins he
[41:54] was surrounded by 12 tribes of Israel
[41:56] right there were three on each side in
[41:58] every direction we find that that same
[42:01] pillar fire comes tabernacled in flesh
[42:03] in Jesus Christ and he's surrounded by
[42:06] twelve disciples because God guards his
[42:11] word and I hope this doesn't stumble you
[42:13] but God that holy place is only for the
[42:15] bride it's only for the bride because
[42:19] God is not just gonna just gonna give
[42:22] his word out and just have it miss
[42:23] handling everything that's what happened
[42:24] through the church ages but if brother
[42:26] Ram talks about how the Gospels how each
[42:29] one is a cherubim amen you got Matthew
[42:32] Mark Luke and John how ones one's a lion
[42:34] ones one's a man an ox and John's the
[42:37] eagle and he said that the Gospels guard
[42:40] the book of Acts the vegard because in
[42:43] Matthew how many multitudes of people
[42:45] this morning are preaching baptism in
[42:48] the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost
[42:49] because of what Jesus said in Matthew
[42:51] 28:19
[42:52] but brother Graham said that is guarding
[42:54] the truth of acts 2:38 because the elect
[42:58] can enter in there God has always failed
[43:04] the Word of God has always failed so we
[43:08] have to know how to approach Jesus
[43:10] Christ it's not complicated because it's
[43:12] not a set of rules it's not something
[43:15] you've got to know you get to Jesus and
[43:18] he will lead you and guide you into all
[43:20] truth it's not learning it's not it
[43:25] should not be overwhelming it's get to
[43:27] Jesus and he will lead you and guide you
[43:30] into all truth that's what it's all
[43:33] about
[43:34] you get to God because he is the word
[43:36] and he will reveal because if God will
[43:40] not reveal himself to you in the form of
[43:44] a word that's already gone by the Holy
[43:47] Ghost will not lead you and guide you
[43:49] and to Luther's truth he will lead you
[43:52] and guide you into the message of the
[43:54] day that's what he will lead you and
[43:57] guide you in because it's all truth
[44:01] let's go to st. John 17
[44:04] I pray you have established in your
[44:10] hearts God's chosen place of worship
[44:12] brother and preached a lot on that
[44:14] you've got to come to God's provided
[44:17] place of worship his chosen place of
[44:20] worship st. John 17 these words spake
[44:26] Jesus lifted up his eyes to heaven and
[44:30] said father the hour has come glorify
[44:33] thy son that thy son also may glorify
[44:35] thee as thou has given him power over
[44:38] all flesh that he should give eternal
[44:41] life to as many as thou has given him
[44:43] and this is life eternal that they might
[44:47] know thee the only true God in Jesus
[44:50] Christ whom thou had sent that's life
[44:53] eternal is to know Jesus I have
[44:56] glorified thee on the earth I have
[44:58] finished the work which thou gave us me
[45:00] to do and now O Father glorify thou me
[45:03] with thine own self with the glory which
[45:05] I had with thee before the world was
[45:09] before we go on let me remind you that
[45:12] remember the name of God is also the
[45:14] word of God because Jesus Christ is a
[45:18] manifestation of the word he said I have
[45:20] manifested thy name unto the men which
[45:24] thou gave us me out of the world then
[45:27] they were and now gave us them me and
[45:30] they have kept thy word now they have
[45:33] known that all things whatsoever thou
[45:35] has given me are of thee for I have
[45:37] given unto them the words which thou
[45:39] gave us me and they have received them
[45:41] and have known surely that I came out
[45:43] from thee and they have believed that
[45:45] thou did send me I pray for them I pray
[45:50] not for the world but for them which
[45:52] thou has given me for they are thine
[45:54] he's praying for us here in st. John 17
[45:57] he's not praying for the Pharisees
[45:58] because he manifested God's name to them
[46:01] and they crucified Him
[46:03] but he's manifested his name to the
[46:06] elect and over here in verse 6 he said
[46:08] and they have kept thy word this is
[46:12] right before he goes to the crucifixion
[46:14] this is right before he gets to the
[46:16] Garden of Gethsemane he's
[46:18] praying for us that's how you have to
[46:21] look at it he is praying for you right
[46:25] there in st. John 17 he's praying for
[46:28] the elect that when the name of God is
[46:30] manifested the elect believe it that is
[46:36] the evidence of the Holy Ghost receiving
[46:40] the word for your day which is Jesus
[46:42] Christ not given this to someone and
[46:46] they take it and intellectually believe
[46:48] God sent a prophet but when it becomes a
[46:50] part of them when it's alive in them
[46:54] when it is in the very soul because
[46:58] we're coming to a very tricky hour in
[47:00] Matthew 24:24 Jesus said it be it be so
[47:03] closely to see the very elected
[47:04] impossible Pentecostal denomination
[47:07] can't deceive the elective and couldn't
[47:09] for years and years but it's right there
[47:11] right around the bride
[47:14] that's what Judas was Judas was not a
[47:16] Pharisee Judas was right next to Jesus
[47:20] the entire time the entire time and when
[47:25] did he make himself known right before
[47:27] the crucifixion he showed his colors
[47:28] riots time the crucifixion right then so
[47:33] we know that there's got to be a bonding
[47:35] of that Jesus said by the tears first
[47:38] they have to be bound first they're
[47:40] being bound now then that wheats to be
[47:43] taken to the garner just that thrashin
[47:46] time because remember everything that
[47:48] can be taken will be shaken to the very
[47:51] core that is why intellectual belief in
[47:58] this message will not hold
[48:00] that is why I'm saying you've got to
[48:03] weave such a revelation between the
[48:07] Bible and the message you can never be
[48:10] shaken Jesus say that I'll build my
[48:13] church upon this rock Peter didn't say I
[48:16] believe Lord that you're Noah he said
[48:19] others were believing in today you were
[48:20] Jeremiah and some were saying you were
[48:22] Isaiah and some were saying this that's
[48:25] what they were believing but Peter
[48:27] believed he was Jesus Christ the Son of
[48:29] God Jesus I mean brother Peter had a
[48:33] present-tense faith he understood
[48:37] exactly what day he was living in he
[48:39] knew exactly he recognized God's
[48:42] presence he recognized the message of
[48:45] his hour but you know it still took a
[48:49] Holy Ghost baptism because after when
[48:52] Jesus was led over there to be judged he
[48:54] denied Jesus so people can have now I
[48:59] believe Peter had a revelation but it
[49:00] had he still had to be feel what the
[49:02] Holy Ghost you can say well bless God I
[49:05] know I realize brother Graham is a
[49:06] prophet
[49:07] that's good but you're not there yet
[49:10] you've got to take it on to the Holy
[49:12] Ghost and then you'll know that Jesus
[49:14] Christ raised from the dead you'll know
[49:16] that you know the Bible says that no man
[49:18] can call Jesus the Christ but by the
[49:20] Holy Ghost
[49:20] up until then it's an intellectual
[49:23] conception up until then you're
[49:26] believing unto it and you believe it
[49:27] you've been taught you read it and
[49:29] you're trying to apply your faith but
[49:31] when you become indwelt then you're a
[49:33] witness of it you're a witness that when
[49:38] you're in dwelled and you say I know he
[49:40] raised from the dead before it I believe
[49:44] he raised from the dead right I believe
[49:46] I'm believing because Jesus told Peter
[49:49] said when you are converted strengthen
[49:51] your brethren right brother I said that
[49:55] before you get the Holy Ghost you're not
[49:56] even converted you're just believing
[49:58] into it you're in you're on the way
[50:00] that's wonderful because you've got to
[50:03] be justified before you can be
[50:05] sanctified you've got to be sanctified
[50:06] before you can be filled with the Holy
[50:08] Ghost it's a process and you know even
[50:10] being born again as your
[50:12] baby you still grow there's still a lot
[50:15] of mercy on our lives when when you're
[50:17] born again when a baby is born there's
[50:20] no denying that the baby has life right
[50:22] the baby is alive it's breathing
[50:25] but it still Falls it still bumps its
[50:28] knees
[50:29] so don't beat yourself up over your
[50:31] mistakes because we still fall and as
[50:36] long as we're in these bodies we will
[50:37] always fall within ourselves but the
[50:41] important thing is to get up and not
[50:43] stay down when you make a mistake you
[50:45] quickly repent I'm sorry Lord I didn't
[50:48] mean to do that and there's not a single
[50:50] one of us that doesn't have to repent
[50:51] every day if the Prophet said he backs
[50:54] sides every day we backslide every day
[50:58] and he you know he people would mistake
[51:02] him for God he had that much of the
[51:06] presence of the Holy Ghost in his life
[51:07] and he said I backslide every day so
[51:12] don't think that you're the only one
[51:14] that makes mistakes don't think you're
[51:16] the only one that ever gets a wrong idea
[51:19] a wrong perception because the greatest
[51:21] matter that ever thought is in the mind
[51:23] because in the beginning the Prophet
[51:26] tells us that God chose a man's heart
[51:28] and Satan chose a man's mind that's
[51:31] where the battle happens where the RAM
[51:34] said you can't help crows flying over
[51:36] your your farm the farmer can't help
[51:38] that he said don't let him roost and
[51:41] that's where the problem is you know I
[51:42] mean if the crows fly they fly you
[51:45] dismiss it you repent but don't let them
[51:48] roost because when they roost what
[51:51] happens they lay eggs and you've got
[51:53] more crows than ever and it just
[51:55] multiplies it just multiplies amen
[51:59] so we have to remember Jesus was the
[52:02] only one that sinless by nature not a
[52:03] single one of us or because Jesus is
[52:07] never God don't send anyone to hell for
[52:11] being a sinner because you can't help
[52:13] being a sinner that's how he came to the
[52:15] world he sends people to hell well he
[52:18] don't send it
[52:19] people send themselves to hell by
[52:21] refusing the atonement by refusing
[52:25] the others think brother Brennan said
[52:27] that a person fights their way to hell
[52:28] because hell wasn't created for human
[52:31] beings it was created for the devil and
[52:33] his angels and he knows that's way he's
[52:35] going Satan does he knows he's got a
[52:37] short time so he's fighting harder than
[52:39] he ever has the devil knows where he's
[52:45] going what we need to do is remind him
[52:48] where he's going because the only thing
[52:51] that reasons against the word because
[52:52] you know a lot of times people can get
[52:55] conceptions in their mind and think
[52:56] they're thinking something when it's
[52:58] really the enemy here's a good way to
[53:02] think to discern and God give us all the
[53:05] wisdom to discern when it's the enemy
[53:06] because when he comes against the word
[53:08] and the promise of the hour it's the
[53:10] devil when he's trying to put fear in
[53:13] your heart it's the devil when he's
[53:15] trying to put doubt in your heart it's
[53:17] the devil because God is not an author
[53:22] of confusion he's not the author of fear
[53:25] he's the author of love and peace amen
[53:29] he's not an author of confusion so
[53:32] whenever something comes on to you or
[53:35] something comes honor that they get
[53:36] scared and and like I was saying earlier
[53:37] you know there will be a trial and Satan
[53:40] will use that trial and use your
[53:41] emotions against you I always use the
[53:48] emotions against you let's go on in
[53:52] Saint John 17 it's talking about keeping
[53:55] us in their name verse 7 now they have
[53:58] known that all things whatsoever thou
[54:00] has given me are of thee for I have
[54:02] given unto them the words that thou gave
[54:04] us me and have received them and have
[54:06] known surely that I came out from thee
[54:07] and they have believed that's how to
[54:09] send me I pray for them I pray not for
[54:12] the worlds but I pray for them which
[54:15] thou has given me see it's not for the
[54:17] world for they are thine and all are
[54:19] thine and thine are mind and I'm
[54:21] glorified in them and now I am no more
[54:24] in the world but these are in the world
[54:25] and I come to thee Holy Father keep
[54:28] through thine own name those whom thou
[54:31] has given me that they may be one as we
[54:34] are that was God's that was Jesus's
[54:39] prayer that was his intention is that we
[54:41] may be one with him as Jesus and the
[54:45] father are one oneness while I was with
[54:50] them in the world I kept them in their
[54:52] name those that I has given me I kept
[54:55] and none of them is lost but the son of
[54:58] perdition that the Scriptures might be
[55:01] fulfilled so we'll stop there now see
[55:05] how many times Jesus keeps repeating
[55:07] that he has manifested their name
[55:10] he has manifested the name of God keep
[55:12] through thy name it's the name it's the
[55:14] name and that's what Satan always
[55:15] attacks is that name of Jesus Christ
[55:18] because Jesus said in my name they shall
[55:20] cast out devils and my name they shall
[55:22] heal the sick
[55:23] we're supposed to be baptized in his
[55:25] name live in his name be buried in his
[55:28] name everything in the name of Jesus
[55:30] Christ he said the Bible says whatever
[55:32] you do in word or deed be it all in the
[55:34] name of Jesus Christ everything is to be
[55:37] done in his name brother Graham said if
[55:39] you can't say something and this this
[55:42] preaches all of us you know don't think
[55:44] that when a preacher preaches he and
[55:45] preaching to himself - if it's true
[55:48] preaching he's preaching to himself hey
[55:50] man but he said don't say nothing unless
[55:53] you can say it in Jesus name
[55:54] don't do nothing except you can do it in
[55:58] Jesus name
[55:59] if you can't do it in Jesus name then
[56:01] don't do it if you can't think it and
[56:04] Jesus name then don't do it because
[56:05] remember he said that our thoughts are
[56:08] speaking heaven right right they're
[56:13] louder in heaven than our words are on
[56:14] earth our thoughts are right so we got
[56:19] to think in Jesus name and remember we
[56:21] still have the crows brother I said you
[56:24] blast them with the shotgun with the
[56:25] word that's what you blast them with get
[56:28] thee behind me Satan amen get thee
[56:31] behind me Satan in the name of Jesus
[56:33] Christ you rebuke Satan in the name of
[56:36] Jesus Christ
[56:37] he said rebuke he said that he's talking
[56:40] about the devil and he said that you
[56:41] know rebuke him and he'll flee from you
[56:43] resist the devil and he will flee from
[56:46] you resist doesn't necessarily mean it's
[56:50] just a one-time attack
[56:52] resist means it's repetitive and you
[56:55] know Paul you know you see him in the
[56:58] Bible and you see how the great
[57:00] revelation that God had given Paul to be
[57:02] able to separate law from grace and to
[57:05] be able to preach Jesus Christ out of
[57:07] the gist the Old Testament he laid it
[57:09] all out yet God allowed an evil spirit
[57:13] to constantly buffett Paul so that he
[57:16] won't be exalted above the revelation
[57:18] brother branham had trials and I
[57:21] remember him saying about you know he
[57:23] was talking about how he how he's got to
[57:25] wait on the Lord you know he said people
[57:27] come to him and God gives me a vision
[57:28] and I tell them what to do by the Holy
[57:31] Ghost and they go do he said but I've
[57:32] got to sit there and wait he said he's
[57:36] got to sit there and wait so the name of
[57:40] God is Jesus Christ and it's the Word of
[57:42] God and when you see Jesus and when you
[57:44] think of Jesus everything that God was
[57:47] he poured into Christ and that is a very
[57:49] nature of God and your name and the
[57:52] names have a lot to do with the
[57:55] characteristic of something that is why
[57:57] God is in the business of changing names
[58:00] you know there's so many example in the
[58:02] Bible with Jacob and before he rests
[58:04] with the angel he was Jacob which ments
[58:05] the planner and afterwards he became
[58:07] Israel prints with God you know Saul was
[58:10] changed to Paul and many others God will
[58:14] change the name because it represents
[58:15] the character then acts 4:10 he said be
[58:22] it known unto you all and to all the
[58:24] people of Israel that by the name of
[58:26] Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you
[58:28] crucified whom God raised from the dead
[58:30] even by him to this man stand here
[58:33] before you hold this is the stone which
[58:36] was set at nought of you builders which
[58:37] has become the head of the corner
[58:39] neither is there salvation in any other
[58:42] for there's not none other name under
[58:45] heaven given among men whereby we must
[58:49] be saved it's only in the name of Jesus
[58:53] Christ the prophet of God said if
[58:55] somebody's baptised in titles of father
[58:57] son Holy Ghost they're baptized into the
[58:59] Catholic Church so think of all these
[59:02] Protestant daughters
[59:04] that baptize entitles and they don't
[59:06] know what they're baptized right to the
[59:07] Catholic Church they don't realize it so
[59:16] the name God put his name where he wants
[59:19] to be worshipped so we've got to find
[59:21] out the name of Jesus Christ where is it
[59:24] how do we approach God you know in the
[59:28] revelation or the amount of word given
[59:33] for each age has to do with how much was
[59:35] let out because Wesley had a little more
[59:37] revelation than Luther did it was still
[59:39] the same thing whenever you plant a
[59:42] grain or a crop of corn you plant that
[59:44] corn seed in the ground but you don't
[59:47] know what the seed look like unless
[59:49] you're the one that planted it until it
[59:51] comes to fruition and when that corner
[59:53] or that wheat comes up to the top then
[59:55] you say that is what's in there in the
[59:58] ground so that's how the Word of God is
[1:00:02] because jesus said except a corn of
[1:00:04] wheat fall on the ground at abideth
[1:00:06] alone so put it in the ground it grew
[1:00:09] throughout the process of time church
[1:00:11] ages are simply a timeline they're a
[1:00:16] Gentile dispensation timeline that God
[1:00:18] deals with the Gentiles when you hear me
[1:00:21] refer to church ages God allows a lot is
[1:00:24] so much word as he was coming on up and
[1:00:27] there was a man of God who caught the
[1:00:29] word of the hour and he kept the elec
[1:00:31] clean for that age and they believed the
[1:00:33] word and they were saved by it that's
[1:00:35] what they would see the Holy Ghost by by
[1:00:37] receiving that word now these seven
[1:00:40] church ages which he can find we'll get
[1:00:42] there in a minute
[1:00:43] we can go internal they're revelations
[1:00:45] too I'll read it in a few minutes but
[1:00:47] there were seven churches and we were
[1:00:51] talking about names about how the
[1:00:53] reflects character and these seven
[1:00:56] churches were literal geographical
[1:00:58] churches that were scattered throughout
[1:01:01] Asia Minor and the Mary's but yet their
[1:01:05] names prophesied an age
[1:01:10] they prophesied a character of that age
[1:01:16] like Ephesus was a First Church age and
[1:01:20] that name means relaxed that's what the
[1:01:23] church meant that's what the name meant
[1:01:25] was relaxed and we find that in the
[1:01:27] church ages they got relaxed about the
[1:01:30] word semana means bitter Pergamos you
[1:01:39] can go and pull up that chart brother
[1:01:40] Joe just so they can follow along for
[1:01:44] those that aren't too familiar with it
[1:01:49] some Myrna Ephesus means relaxed see
[1:01:54] these are seven church ages those were
[1:01:58] the messengers that God sent to each and
[1:01:59] every age those were the ones that had
[1:02:02] the word for their day there are the
[1:02:03] ones that caught those were one of the
[1:02:05] Angels the Stars and Jesus his right
[1:02:07] hand there's seven of them amen
[1:02:09] and this is just the light that each age
[1:02:11] was given and God allotted to each age
[1:02:14] just like he did in the Old Testament
[1:02:16] you know like he had a know wall then he
[1:02:18] had a Moses and he's bringing it on down
[1:02:20] he had an allotment and then at the end
[1:02:22] is Jesus Christ made flesh God made
[1:02:25] flesh so emphasis means relaxed semana
[1:02:29] means bitter Pergamos means married and
[1:02:33] that is where the church and the state
[1:02:35] United they married tight IRA means
[1:02:39] dominating female that's when the
[1:02:41] Catholic Church had the Dark Ages Sardis
[1:02:45] means the escaped ones Luther called
[1:02:47] them out and they escaped Philadelphia
[1:02:50] means love of the Brethren and Lady of
[1:02:52] SIA means people's rights and we know
[1:02:56] that so true ain't it people's rights
[1:02:58] you see so much happened you know the
[1:03:00] voting of women and just civil rights
[1:03:03] and just rights rights rights that's
[1:03:06] what it's all about
[1:03:07] but you know what sheep gives up their
[1:03:10] right he just the she just lets the
[1:03:13] master just shear all that wool off you
[1:03:16] know the sheep is not does not
[1:03:18] manufacture that wool it bears it
[1:03:20] naturally from the inside out so we're
[1:03:22] not to manufacture
[1:03:24] the Holy Ghost because if somebody you
[1:03:28] know sticks peacock feathers and tries
[1:03:31] to make themselves a peacock or eagle
[1:03:32] feathers when they're crow eventually
[1:03:34] them feathers may be fresh for a while
[1:03:36] and they'll wither up and fall off
[1:03:39] because they're not genuine so let's go
[1:03:43] to revelations 2 and see what God did
[1:03:50] with the name revelations 2 we'll just
[1:03:56] read verse 3 he this is the first church
[1:03:58] age will start verse 1 unto the Angel of
[1:04:02] the Church of Ephesus write these things
[1:04:04] saith he that holdeth the seven stars in
[1:04:06] his right hand who walketh in the midst
[1:04:08] of the seven golden candlesticks I know
[1:04:11] thy works and thy labour and thy
[1:04:13] patience and how thou canst not bear
[1:04:14] them which are evil thou has tribe in
[1:04:17] which say they are apostles and are not
[1:04:19] and has found them liars and has borne
[1:04:21] and has patience and for my name's sake
[1:04:24] has labored and has not fainted so see
[1:04:29] they had the revelation the word started
[1:04:31] fresh in the Church of the Ephesians
[1:04:33] right they had the word they had the
[1:04:35] power they had the works and it was
[1:04:37] coming on down and then in verse 13 I
[1:04:41] want us to watch in verse 13 this is the
[1:04:45] Pergamos this is the third age I know
[1:04:48] that works and where thou dwellest even
[1:04:50] where Satan's seat is and thou holdest
[1:04:52] fast my name and that's not denied my
[1:04:55] faith even in those days wherein Antipas
[1:04:58] was my faithful martyr which was slain
[1:05:00] among you where Satan dwelleth okay now
[1:05:04] that was the first three in the fourth
[1:05:06] Church age I want us to watch because
[1:05:08] there's no name mentioned in the fourth
[1:05:10] church age in the dark age in the Church
[1:05:13] of Thyatira you can read on that when
[1:05:15] you go home as no name mentioned and in
[1:05:18] chapter 3 of Revelations will start
[1:05:22] verse 1 and unto the Angel of the Church
[1:05:25] of Sardis write these things saith he
[1:05:28] that hath the seven spirits of God and
[1:05:31] the Seven Stars I know thy works and
[1:05:34] that thou hast a name that thou livest
[1:05:37] and our dead so we see brother Joe if
[1:05:41] you can pull up the church age chart
[1:05:45] they're the first church age had the
[1:05:48] name the second church H had a name and
[1:05:53] per the moats are still holding on to
[1:05:54] that name
[1:05:55] they held faster the name if I Tyra it
[1:05:57] disappears
[1:05:59] and Stardust they come out on the other
[1:06:01] side with a name that they live but
[1:06:04] they're actually dead
[1:06:05] and remember luther baptized in titles
[1:06:09] before they had Jesus name baptism then
[1:06:13] they lost the revelation of the name in
[1:06:14] Thyatira they come out on the other side
[1:06:16] and start us with the name that they
[1:06:18] live but they're dead so they lost the
[1:06:23] revelation of the name so that means God
[1:06:25] had a restoration to do he had to bring
[1:06:29] it back because there's power in the
[1:06:31] name of Jesus and Satan knows that so he
[1:06:34] can pull the wool over people's eyes
[1:06:36] he's got him but there's a restoration
[1:06:39] promised you can keep that up brother
[1:06:43] John I'm just gonna read a verse here in
[1:06:44] the Philadelphia NH and to the angel of
[1:06:47] the church in Philadelphia write these
[1:06:49] things saith he that is holy he that is
[1:06:52] true he that hath the key of David he
[1:06:54] that openeth the no man shutteth and
[1:06:56] shutteth and no man openeth I know thy
[1:06:59] works behold I have set before thee an
[1:07:03] open door and no man can shut it for
[1:07:08] thou hast a little strength and has kept
[1:07:10] my word and has not denied my name
[1:07:15] at the age of the open door brother and
[1:07:17] said that was in the Philadelphia Church
[1:07:19] H and he said that Philadelphia in
[1:07:21] church age overlaps he said the church
[1:07:23] ages weren't you know an abrupt start
[1:07:26] and an abrupt stop there was an overlap
[1:07:28] especially lady of seeing because in
[1:07:30] that Philadelphia Church age was a big
[1:07:33] missionary agent means brotherly love or
[1:07:36] love of the Brethren so there was a big
[1:07:37] missionary effort to spread the gospel
[1:07:39] so wasn't overlapping but jesus promised
[1:07:42] that he was set before us an open door
[1:07:44] and Jesus is the door
[1:07:49] and of course in the next one we find
[1:07:52] Jesus knocking he got kicked out in the
[1:07:56] message Ephesian Church age you can keep
[1:07:59] that chart up so I can just point to it
[1:08:01] now the first round the Apostles now we
[1:08:04] see this in the beginning Pentecost he's
[1:08:07] walking around the same great God the
[1:08:09] same great signs we're to take place all
[1:08:11] down through these ages because he
[1:08:13] walked among kids at each age blessing
[1:08:15] what his people that's assembled in his
[1:08:17] name I want you to watch this as we go
[1:08:21] through the church this church had Jesus
[1:08:24] name this church had Jesus name this
[1:08:28] church had Jesus name he said and this
[1:08:31] church lost it this church come out the
[1:08:36] Sardis this church come out of the
[1:08:38] Lutheran age with the name that you live
[1:08:40] but you're dead he said and goes right
[1:08:42] on down to the end of this age the
[1:08:45] Philadelphian in between this age of
[1:08:48] philadelphia and the lady of sia this
[1:08:51] age there's an open door set that brings
[1:08:54] back that name again to the church he
[1:08:57] said now watch and see if that is the
[1:08:58] truth
[1:08:59] after we get it here to the scriptures
[1:09:01] between the two ages so they kept the
[1:09:04] name then they lost it and that was a
[1:09:07] dark age because there's power in the
[1:09:09] name of Jesus and they lost the
[1:09:11] revelation of the name of who he was he
[1:09:18] said now then we can see that Jesus is
[1:09:21] the door he is the door to the Sheep and
[1:09:23] notice that it speaks now of the door
[1:09:26] opening what is that but a revelation of
[1:09:30] him and that revelation is opening up to
[1:09:35] bring a strength to illuminate the word
[1:09:38] and glorify his name it was in the midst
[1:09:41] of the last two ages that the revelation
[1:09:44] of the deity of Jesus Christ bloomed out
[1:09:46] before us because God had a prophet on
[1:09:50] earth to reveal the true baptism to
[1:09:52] reveal the true name of Jesus Christ
[1:09:55] because real Ram says here what is that
[1:09:57] but a revelation of him
[1:10:00] that is what the revelation that is what
[1:10:02] the open door is it opens Jesus is the
[1:10:05] door and he opens the word amen he said
[1:10:10] yes we knew that he was God how else
[1:10:12] could he be our Savior but to know that
[1:10:14] he was only God or God alone and that he
[1:10:18] was the Alpha and the Omega that this
[1:10:20] Jesus was both Lord and Christ making
[1:10:24] him the Lord Jesus Christ the Father the
[1:10:26] Son and Holy Ghost all one person that
[1:10:29] had been lost since the first ages but
[1:10:32] now we are seeing it again that's why
[1:10:36] God needed to send a prophet to restore
[1:10:39] everything that was lost to restore the
[1:10:42] name that was lost at the beginning of
[1:10:43] the ages it got lost I got motored up so
[1:10:46] God had us in a prophet to say this is
[1:10:48] what it is
[1:10:51] he said the revelation of who he was had
[1:10:54] come back indeed Godhead is not a
[1:10:57] three-person God with one personality
[1:11:00] for it takes personality to make a
[1:11:03] person and you'll see that if you go
[1:11:05] like two denominational Church websites
[1:11:07] when they have their statement of faith
[1:11:08] they'll say we believe you know in one
[1:11:11] God with three personalities and that's
[1:11:14] what he's saying here it's not possible
[1:11:16] to have a personality without being a
[1:11:18] person but they who believe in three
[1:11:22] persons have a three god Godhead in our
[1:11:25] guilty of breaking the first commandment
[1:11:29] that's why God had it to restore that's
[1:11:33] why God had to restore because the name
[1:11:35] was been lost and when that name comes
[1:11:38] back and that power comes back into the
[1:11:40] church brother Ram said he said you
[1:11:45] ought to see then
[1:11:55] he talks about was an Israel in the
[1:11:59] church here it is he says and I believe
[1:12:01] we're on the borderland tonight I was
[1:12:04] wondering about all these meetings all
[1:12:05] my meetings and things how I had to
[1:12:07] cancel him he said I truly believe
[1:12:08] before the church can have the rapture
[1:12:10] it's got to have rapturing faith he said
[1:12:14] we can't even have faith for divine
[1:12:15] healing let alone rapture in faith he
[1:12:17] said got to have a faith that are
[1:12:19] changed and quickened this body and be
[1:12:20] taken away he said I believe there's a
[1:12:22] church on his Road tonight a power of
[1:12:25] the Living God that man will speak the
[1:12:28] word here and there little flash like
[1:12:29] lightning amen I believe that with all
[1:12:32] my heart
[1:12:33] you say well where is it brother Ram
[1:12:35] said that it's not so perfect now I said
[1:12:38] wait to them World Council of Churches
[1:12:39] get together and start persecuting the
[1:12:41] bride then it'll start because we're in
[1:12:44] dude with power really Jesus has the
[1:12:48] power and he's giving us the authority
[1:12:50] but when it's necessary to use he'll use
[1:12:53] it you know brother Joe gave me a quote
[1:12:56] about Joshua and what the prophets said
[1:12:58] about how he made the shadow of the son
[1:13:00] you know stay on the earth and that's
[1:13:02] how he was able to carry God's plan
[1:13:05] Joshua did not premeditate that he was
[1:13:09] in the line of duty fulfilling the word
[1:13:12] he said son stand still I need more time
[1:13:14] before they regroup before they they're
[1:13:17] all routed now I need more time to
[1:13:19] fulfill your word so if there comes a
[1:13:22] time and I believe there will be to
[1:13:23] where we need that quickening power it's
[1:13:26] there it's like a lion waiting to come
[1:13:29] out of a cage and as soon as that cage
[1:13:32] comes out there she comes there he comes
[1:13:35] because God has all power but we can't
[1:13:38] say things within ourself when brother
[1:13:42] bran was on the platform that maniac who
[1:13:43] ran in remember to try and kill him he
[1:13:47] said The ministers scattered off the
[1:13:49] platform he said I would have to but he
[1:13:52] felt that presence and then God took
[1:13:54] control
[1:13:55] he didn't pretty Maritain say you know
[1:13:56] he wouldn't do nothing without a vision
[1:13:59] because he's like Jesus you know when
[1:14:03] Elijah when he was over there on Mount
[1:14:04] Carmel he said as thou has showed me God
[1:14:08] had already showed to Elijah what was
[1:14:10] gonna happen we can't presume in Finch
[1:14:14] without authority but when it's God
[1:14:16] Almighty speaking it it's gonna come to
[1:14:19] pass because brother Graham said that
[1:14:21] when we put the Word of God upon our
[1:14:22] lips he said it's the same idea T
[1:14:24] speaking cuz that's how the bride is
[1:14:27] able to prophesy because she gets the
[1:14:29] word in her she eats the book you know
[1:14:33] brother Branham said that a seal is the
[1:14:36] sign of ownership and a mark is it's not
[1:14:39] a distinction when God mark Cain he was
[1:14:43] separated but we are sealed by the Holy
[1:14:46] Ghost to the day of redemption and God
[1:14:49] you know then seven seals God had in the
[1:14:51] back part of his mind they were his he
[1:14:53] owned him amen and he gave him to the
[1:14:56] bride he gave it to the Prophet who gave
[1:14:58] it to the bride Jesus Christ Himself
[1:15:00] descended from heaven and John who
[1:15:03] represents you and me when took the book
[1:15:06] out of Jesus Christ from Jesus Christ
[1:15:09] he owned him he loosed him and gave him
[1:15:12] to the bride and now the question is
[1:15:16] what are we doing with it are we eating
[1:15:18] it that's what we've got to put
[1:15:19] ourselves on the spot are we eating the
[1:15:21] book because revelations 10 once the
[1:15:23] seven is wonderful when it happened but
[1:15:24] now revelations 10 8 to 11 got to happen
[1:15:27] we've got to eat the book you are what
[1:15:31] you eat as the saying goes right so you
[1:15:34] feed on the wrong things
[1:15:36] you'll produce the wrong things you eat
[1:15:40] the right thing you'll produced you I
[1:15:41] promise you this you eat this and it'll
[1:15:45] produce the rapture you eat this and
[1:15:50] it'll produce a body change because
[1:15:55] that's what this word was sent for us to
[1:15:56] quicken the endtime elect to let us know
[1:16:00] what day and hour we're living in let's
[1:16:07] move on he's talking about the name
[1:16:11] how that open door was set that open
[1:16:14] door was set to restore a name and when
[1:16:16] that revelation is brought it brings
[1:16:18] about a name change it brings about a
[1:16:21] name change because with the name change
[1:16:23] comes the nature change when Saul became
[1:16:26] Paul he was no longer saw when Jacob
[1:16:29] became Israel he was no longer as a
[1:16:31] planner he was a prince with God so we
[1:16:36] see that Abram Abraham used to be Abram
[1:16:42] but God changed his name Sarah used to
[1:16:46] be Sarah but God changed her name and
[1:16:49] Jehovah Jireh
[1:16:51] number two brother Ram said notice after
[1:16:58] the appearing in this name of Almighty
[1:17:01] God and it was revealed to him to
[1:17:04] Abraham that he was the all-sufficient
[1:17:06] one he had no helpers he didn't need any
[1:17:09] any secretaries he was God alone God he
[1:17:13] was alone God he was God alone he
[1:17:15] appeared to Abraham in this name and
[1:17:17] when he appeared in this name and
[1:17:19] Abraham recognized who he was he changed
[1:17:23] Abraham's name now he's coming to the
[1:17:26] fullness of believing now see where the
[1:17:30] church has come I hope he can read
[1:17:32] between the lines come up to a place
[1:17:34] where he's revealed to him who he was
[1:17:36] and then he changed Abraham's name so
[1:17:40] the promise could be fulfilled didn't
[1:17:43] brother Bram say in the seals
[1:17:44] I'm gonna call you bride he's an
[1:17:47] uncultured he said what's the difference
[1:17:49] between a bride and a church a world of
[1:17:53] difference there's a world of difference
[1:17:55] between your wife and another woman huge
[1:17:59] difference and there's a huge difference
[1:18:02] between the Bride of Christ and the
[1:18:04] Church of Christ there's other good
[1:18:07] women but I've only got one wife right
[1:18:11] there's no there's good people in
[1:18:14] churches but God has one bride
[1:18:16] who stays true to him so it's time now
[1:18:20] that after the revelation of when God
[1:18:22] came down to Abraham and appeared to him
[1:18:24] in flesh Luke 17 30 he changed Abraham's
[1:18:28] name an expectation to chant to receive
[1:18:32] a promise son he said notice he changed
[1:18:40] his name here now from Abram to Abraham
[1:18:41] which means father of Nations added H am
[1:18:45] Abraham so he did this so that the
[1:18:47] complete promise could be fulfilled and
[1:18:50] the son now that had been promised so
[1:18:52] long could be seen or otherwise be
[1:18:55] revealed and when he changed his name
[1:19:00] and after he recognized who he was he
[1:19:03] might have been might have thought there
[1:19:04] were a party of them like lot but he
[1:19:08] recognized that he was Elohim God alone
[1:19:11] and when he did that then he changed his
[1:19:14] name he said now Abraham you're no more
[1:19:17] be called Abram but Abraham father of
[1:19:19] Nations I've made you Abraham now he is
[1:19:23] in the condition now he is in the
[1:19:25] condition after the revelation of who he
[1:19:27] was after the open door he is now in
[1:19:30] condition to see the Sun revealed after
[1:19:34] the revelation of who he was when
[1:19:37] Abraham got the revelation of who God
[1:19:38] was that he was God alone as he said
[1:19:40] here then he was able he was getting in
[1:19:44] condition to receive the body change and
[1:19:47] see the promised son and Abraham seed
[1:19:52] follows the same thing because there's a
[1:19:54] covenant that has to be confirmed God
[1:19:58] confirms his covenant covenant and
[1:20:00] agreement a promise you know in the old
[1:20:02] days to kill an animal they they what
[1:20:05] they would separate it and that's that
[1:20:07] you know they'd stand over and say let
[1:20:09] us be like this animal if we don't keep
[1:20:11] this covenant and that's what God did
[1:20:15] when he when he took his sacrifice his
[1:20:18] perfect sacrifice Jesus Christ he sent
[1:20:21] his spirit to the church he went up in
[1:20:23] glory so now that has got to be a
[1:20:25] ministry I don't have a piece of paper
[1:20:27] here to tear but there's got to be a
[1:20:29] minister
[1:20:30] that will dovetail just like that
[1:20:33] because it's his ministry and the
[1:20:36] bride's ministry has got to go like this
[1:20:38] and then that covenant is confirmed
[1:20:42] denomination is doing this don't fit
[1:20:45] right it's got to be like this
[1:20:48] remember the Chinese laundrymen it's
[1:20:51] tore in such a way they couldn't write a
[1:20:52] receipt when people came in the old days
[1:20:54] you know they could write and everything
[1:20:57] so they would just tear a receipt of
[1:20:58] center away and give it to you you had
[1:20:59] one piece there the other when he came
[1:21:01] to pick up your clothes it had to match
[1:21:03] oh you couldn't pick up your your
[1:21:06] clothes you know and I believe his
[1:21:09] brother Ram put it you know they left
[1:21:10] their dirty laundry there when they came
[1:21:11] back confirmed that covenant add a clean
[1:21:14] clean laundry right and that's what we
[1:21:17] do because our righteousness is as
[1:21:18] filthy rags before our works nothing
[1:21:22] don't do a single thing because if we
[1:21:26] did something then why is he why - he
[1:21:27] down the cross that's I hope this
[1:21:30] doesn't sound sacrilegious but that's
[1:21:32] like slapping God in the face to hear me
[1:21:35] sends his son to die for you and you try
[1:21:38] and do something right that's not how it
[1:21:41] works because we will never be good
[1:21:44] enough to be saved
[1:21:45] never be good enough to be saved now he
[1:21:49] changed Abraham because brother Graham
[1:21:51] said that ham was part of God's name
[1:21:54] when he came and Elohim h-i-m was part
[1:21:58] of God's name and he gave that to
[1:21:59] Abraham bridegroom is Jesus Christ we
[1:22:04] are the bride we share part of his name
[1:22:06] and when brother Ryan was preaching this
[1:22:08] he didn't say my name is Branham Billy
[1:22:11] Graham has six letters he said that but
[1:22:14] he didn't say Branham has seven he said
[1:22:16] Abraham has seven it's up to the we
[1:22:20] Heath trust the Holy Ghost to reveal
[1:22:22] that to the bride now some of you may
[1:22:29] already know this I did until recently
[1:22:31] but brother branham's name wasn't always
[1:22:33] spelled latm okay y'all knew that that's
[1:22:37] wonderful
[1:22:37] it was B ra n a.m. and we remember when
[1:22:42] his dad killed that man in the bar
[1:22:43] fighting everything and he had to change
[1:22:44] his name his dad was a sinner
[1:22:46] his dad was an alcoholic he didn't know
[1:22:48] nothing about this but he changed it to
[1:22:52] H a.m. instead of just you know B ra n
[1:22:56] a.m. he added to H to make it seven
[1:22:58] letters he didn't know it but God did
[1:23:00] remember brother Graham said that if
[1:23:02] you're not named right God will change
[1:23:04] it so don't say well my name ain't Brian
[1:23:08] oh my my last name only has six what
[1:23:10] brother branham is a bride and he
[1:23:14] represents us as the bride just like
[1:23:16] John represents us has the bride when
[1:23:18] you read about John's book revelations
[1:23:20] put your name there right so that God
[1:23:26] you know remember when Jesus in Luke 4
[1:23:29] went to the temple and he opened the
[1:23:31] scroll the priest gave him the Bible
[1:23:32] look of Isaiah he read it he closed and
[1:23:35] gave it back to the priest the same
[1:23:37] thing happened with the Prophet when he
[1:23:40] memmer when he was preaching birth pains
[1:23:41] they came he that his wife gave him a
[1:23:44] Bible this is what I want it I want to
[1:23:46] mention this because I want you to
[1:23:48] realize I mean any of us do but I want
[1:23:51] to just edify let me put it that way
[1:23:53] I want to edify that this message does
[1:23:55] not come from man the things that are in
[1:23:58] here there's no way a man could have
[1:23:59] orchestrated this there is no way and
[1:24:02] just the name with Branham and H a.m. is
[1:24:05] a prime example now whenever he came and
[1:24:10] he was preaching birth pains his wife
[1:24:11] gave him a Bible and the pages were
[1:24:13] stuck together and he thought it was a
[1:24:15] misprint and he was looking forward and
[1:24:17] couldn't find it and there was a
[1:24:18] Catholic priest on the altar over there
[1:24:21] behind him and the priest gave her the
[1:24:23] brand the Bible because brother Ram said
[1:24:27] that the Pharisees in him they were
[1:24:28] though there were the order the
[1:24:30] religious order of the day just like the
[1:24:32] Catholic Church and they gave Jesus
[1:24:34] Christ the Bible he read it he closed it
[1:24:36] and gave it back and now all the
[1:24:39] congregation eyes were fixed on him and
[1:24:41] the Bible says that precious words
[1:24:42] proceeded out of his mouth so 2,000
[1:24:46] years later God orchestrates the exact
[1:24:49] same picture now why didn't he do that
[1:24:51] in Luther's day right why did he do that
[1:24:55] in Wesley's day
[1:24:56] it's because his Jesus Christ all over
[1:24:59] again
[1:24:59] it's the fullness now it's the rapture
[1:25:02] time remember when Jesus was manifest to
[1:25:06] the first time Saints the Old Testament
[1:25:07] Saints went up with him
[1:25:08] he's manifested the second time the New
[1:25:12] Testament Saints we all go up so God
[1:25:17] changed his name he confirms his name he
[1:25:21] confirms his covenant rather the same
[1:25:24] ministry in the Bride Bible promised
[1:25:33] that he would get a people out of the
[1:25:38] Gentiles for his namesake
[1:25:41] and that life has got to come back into
[1:25:45] the bride that same oneness when brother
[1:25:49] Ram listened to that sermon oneness
[1:25:51] brother Ram is not talking about the
[1:25:52] Trinity he's talking about true oneness
[1:25:55] between the bride and Jesus Christ and
[1:25:59] that's what we have to be we've got to
[1:26:02] be whatever he was we've got to be
[1:26:04] because we are his body we are His Word
[1:26:07] and God made himself manifested he's
[1:26:09] come on down he's revealed to us the
[1:26:12] name we see now down through the church
[1:26:14] ages how they lost the name they lost
[1:26:16] the power they lost the word they got
[1:26:18] married to church and state that
[1:26:20] persecution that corn of wheat was in
[1:26:22] the ground but he said I will restore
[1:26:24] saith the Lord that is why we needed a
[1:26:27] restoration that is why we needed
[1:26:29] because without a restoration we'd be
[1:26:32] believing a word that's already gone by
[1:26:34] without a restoration we would be
[1:26:37] believe in the Jesus Christ of yesterday
[1:26:39] and that's sin when it's you know when
[1:26:43] it's presented to you and then you
[1:26:45] refuse to walk in at your sin because
[1:26:48] Jesus said had I not been made manifest
[1:26:50] you would not have had sin but once he
[1:26:53] became manifested and they rejected it
[1:26:56] it was sin and remember in the Book of
[1:27:00] Revelations remember Satan has a
[1:27:03] counterfeit for everything
[1:27:05] whatever satan cannot create so whenever
[1:27:09] there's he gets righteousness and he
[1:27:11] perverts it that's all he can do right
[1:27:15] allies just the truth that's just been
[1:27:17] perverted it's not quite the truth even
[1:27:19] if it's 99.9% the truth but one last
[1:27:22] it's a lie the whole thing is a lie so
[1:27:26] we see that Satan cannot create and in
[1:27:27] the Book of Revelations
[1:27:28] he's got names too but its names of
[1:27:32] blasphemy blasphemy esteems right which
[1:27:36] build around tells us the denominations
[1:27:37] it's not the people in the denominations
[1:27:42] it's the system we're not against
[1:27:45] anybody what we want to see is a
[1:27:48] personal relationship between Jesus
[1:27:50] Christ in an individual that's what we
[1:27:52] want to see but we want to see Jesus
[1:27:55] Christ and not something that passed by
[1:27:59] because jesus is alive
[1:28:01] remember he said I am the God of Abraham
[1:28:03] Isaac and Jacob Abraham Jacob Isaac and
[1:28:08] Jacob yes he's a God of the living and
[1:28:11] not a God of the Dead he's the great I
[1:28:12] am
[1:28:14] remember when in the manna in the
[1:28:16] wilderness whenever they left that manna
[1:28:18] it was canker the next day it had to be
[1:28:21] fresh it's spiritual food in due season
[1:28:25] it's got to be meat for the hour and as
[1:28:29] our dear brother read about in Psalms by
[1:28:31] the deep calleth unto the deep you know
[1:28:34] blessed is he that hunger and thirst for
[1:28:37] righteousness for they shall be filled
[1:28:38] if there's that deep in there to call
[1:28:41] there's a deep to respond because God
[1:28:44] has created God was the one that created
[1:28:47] that thirst in us you know and many
[1:28:52] times we try and satisfy that thirst for
[1:28:55] something else but remember it's just
[1:28:57] perverted because we're given that
[1:28:59] thirst the Satan comes along and says
[1:29:01] this is which this was satisfy you this
[1:29:03] was satisfied and it never does here's
[1:29:05] only one that can satisfy I want to
[1:29:10] close with this quote in the marriage of
[1:29:11] the Lamb
[1:29:17] he said but you see first decisions made
[1:29:20] next engagement to then promise and then
[1:29:22] the ceremony that's when the bride
[1:29:25] brought takes the bridegroom's name she
[1:29:29] is no more than of her own name she
[1:29:31] takes the bridegroom's name and then
[1:29:34] when the church has the ceremony makes
[1:29:36] their promises then she takes the
[1:29:38] bridegroom's name she's no longer a
[1:29:41] Church of the world
[1:29:42] she is the Church of the Lord Jesus
[1:29:44] Christ amen now I don't mean that by
[1:29:47] name I mean that by birth by nature by
[1:29:50] power of God by the revealed truth of
[1:29:52] God in the heart she becomes a Christian
[1:29:55] Church the great Universal Apostolic
[1:29:57] Christian Church she becomes a part of
[1:30:00] Christ when she does that she Christ
[1:30:04] injects into her his own spirit his own
[1:30:09] life and the Bible said to Adam and Eve
[1:30:13] there you are no longer Twain but one
[1:30:16] and when the woman church is married to
[1:30:20] Christ they are no longer two they are
[1:30:23] one Christ in you amen that's it
[1:30:28] his life has been brought into you then
[1:30:32] you become the bride then you become the
[1:30:36] bride like I said it's not just he said
[1:30:39] over here it's not just like a you know
[1:30:41] it's not just an intellectual Lord I
[1:30:42] promise to do good is when he truly by
[1:30:44] birth become the Bride of Christ then
[1:30:47] it's his life living through you because
[1:30:51] no person can walk no person can live a
[1:30:53] Christian life it takes Christ in the
[1:30:56] individual to live a Christian life it
[1:31:01] takes Jesus Christ in us to believe the
[1:31:04] message that's what it is it's it's him
[1:31:08] in you believing his own word because
[1:31:11] we're a part of him we are a part of him
[1:31:15] so hope something this morning has
[1:31:17] helped you about the name about how it's
[1:31:19] been lost in the church ages and the
[1:31:22] importance of why God needed to send a
[1:31:24] prophet because it's become so common
[1:31:26] God sent a prophet
[1:31:27] and we know that but pray to God if you
[1:31:31] don't already have that revelation why
[1:31:34] God needed to send a prophet because God
[1:31:36] don't do nothing without he don't do
[1:31:38] nothing without a reason he needed to
[1:31:42] send a prophet to buy to all these
[1:31:44] mysteries up and the bride can be
[1:31:47] perfected by because he said the
[1:31:48] bridegroom call will come through this
[1:31:51] remember he said that the messenger on
[1:31:53] earth is so inclined to God that what
[1:31:58] the messenger speaks on earth God echoes
[1:32:00] in heaven and I believe the bride's
[1:32:02] coming to that state too because she is
[1:32:04] the body because it's not the thoughts
[1:32:07] of man it's the thoughts of God and the
[1:32:10] word is in the bride amen
[1:32:13] it's the church now we've got to eat the
[1:32:16] book and become part of it when we
[1:32:18] become a part of it then one day we'll
[1:32:21] just see our loved ones come up and when
[1:32:22] we see them we'll be quickened and I
[1:32:25] believe that'll be you know the last you
[1:32:28] know I believe we're already getting
[1:32:29] ready to just get out of here and God is
[1:32:31] just bringing us to a point of weakness
[1:32:34] and then once that point of weakness
[1:32:36] comes and his strength can be made
[1:32:38] perfect when our strength is gone you
[1:32:42] know and you take that all the way from
[1:32:44] your personal every day to the bride as
[1:32:47] a whole when you're weak when you're
[1:32:49] exhausted when you can't do nothing
[1:32:51] that's when he can move he said the
[1:32:53] greatest enemy I have is William Brown
[1:32:56] the greatest enemy you have is yourself
[1:32:58] a bears enemy I have is myself if I can
[1:33:00] just get myself out of the way no we're
[1:33:02] talking about gifts and things you know
[1:33:04] it's not necessarily mentioned is one of
[1:33:06] the one of the nine spiritual gifts and
[1:33:08] things but I believe it's a gift that
[1:33:10] God helps us get out of the way it's not
[1:33:12] just for ministers because everybody has
[1:33:15] a place everybody has a place you know
[1:33:18] and I'm just a little bitty gear but you
[1:33:21] know if somebody is not in the right if
[1:33:24] one little gears out then the other
[1:33:26] gears there's no big one there's no big
[1:33:28] people little people but there's people
[1:33:30] that have to have you know big here's
[1:33:32] little gears whatever but if say even
[1:33:34] the oil is not on the gear then the gear
[1:33:37] rust then the rust spreads and the whole
[1:33:40] thing quits working
[1:33:41] so everybody has got a place everybody
[1:33:45] has got a place so if we can just yield
[1:33:47] ourselves to that place God will have
[1:33:49] his way and that's a challenge for each
[1:33:51] and every one of us if we can just you
[1:33:53] know my prayers God helped me get to a
[1:33:55] place of weakness God helped me be so
[1:33:59] weak I can't do nothing because that's
[1:34:01] when he can that's when he can do
[1:34:03] everything any time we're trying to
[1:34:04] solve our problems we just mess it up
[1:34:07] anytime we jump the gun so called and as
[1:34:11] we just you know trying and just do
[1:34:13] things within ourselves it never works
[1:34:15] out but if we pray about it and put God
[1:34:18] first he will lead you every single time
[1:34:21] every single time they ma'am I'm gonna
[1:34:24] turn the service back to our brother
[1:34:25] Dale I appreciate y'all so much and
[1:34:27] again thank you for the opportunity to
[1:34:29] just share my heart I've been that's
[1:34:31] what I just felt like the Lord put upon
[1:34:32] my heart to share with you all and we
[1:34:34] love you so much and we're standing with
[1:34:36] you and we're down there Mobile
[1:34:37] believing the same word one day you know
[1:34:39] now we're just separated by geography
[1:34:41] and this and that but one day there'll
[1:34:43] be no separation we'll all be together
[1:34:45] we all have the same father just think
[1:35:08] about you remember brother Theo Erasmus
[1:35:11] I remember one time there's about a good
[1:35:13] point and he said you know he said his
[1:35:15] name is Jesus as Jes us and he said you
[1:35:19] take us out of it and said his name is
[1:35:21] Jess so if you leave the bride out of it
[1:35:26] then it's not a complete night his name
[1:35:30] is Chester that's a good point you just
[1:35:32] think is he cold we don't want to leave
[1:35:34] nothing out and what we are is what he
[1:35:37] has made us but you know I didn't choose
[1:35:39] that did you I didn't have anything to
[1:35:42] do it he chose me but he's got some
[1:35:45] reason for you something for you to do
[1:35:48] or whatever so just be whatever you are
[1:35:51] let's sing
[1:35:54] brother 668 let's sing a little bit and
[1:35:58] worship and just believe
[1:36:18] since Jesus
[1:37:18] thank God his name is Jesus
[1:37:44] right
[1:38:35] jeez
[1:38:50] it was a revelation
[1:38:55] they took the ride around I see another
[1:38:57] one true and living God and gave us a
[1:39:00] Trinity the Father Son and Holy Ghost by
[1:39:05] doing that they met missed everything
[1:39:12] the meaning of that night
[1:39:25] anybody else if you have a name
[1:39:47] that name is
[1:39:57] No
[1:40:01] see
[1:40:30] see that way that all the way down 2/3
[1:40:33] her brother would bring it they could
[1:40:36] pronounce at night Jamie aids me
[1:40:40] no way to pronounce tonight
[1:40:44] Oh Lynette you out no we're putting
[1:40:46] fouled you call it
[1:40:58] back up with his family that could do it
[1:41:05] what he said one day like this my name
[1:41:09] was I never known see they cook top of
[1:41:15] that understand one day
[1:41:21] an angel I was referring to game called
[1:41:25] his name Jesus
[1:41:29] do you know what I love about that but
[1:41:33] his name Jesus would pronounce that was
[1:41:35] to be in
[1:41:37] immanuel god without you
[1:41:40] call his name Jesus that was that dude
[1:41:44] coming down or dead bhp for now human
[1:41:50] race
[1:41:52] I know his name but that was an angel
[1:41:57] for delivering it
[1:42:00] do you know what happened next
[1:42:03] first time to human
[1:42:05] all that name to another human
[1:42:09] Littlejohn and the world of it mother
[1:42:12] chuckle I
[1:42:19] proceed
[1:42:26] the name of Jesus
[1:42:29] I made yogurt pronouncing the name you
[1:42:34] could tell you
[1:42:37] when angle had no connection be able to
[1:42:43] make it manifest
[1:42:48] but it would be
[1:42:50] call that name Jesus do another he would
[1:42:54] be
[1:43:06] and the name of Jesus every knee should
[1:43:09] bow
[1:43:13] I did what are we gonna do with it
[1:43:18] that's why like a brotherhood say in a
[1:43:20] matter
[1:43:22] and we don't know the Father Son Holy
[1:43:25] Ghost ride
[1:43:27] we can prove to you by your own
[1:43:29] encyclopedias where the Catholic Church
[1:43:31] ain't that but that ain't no argument
[1:43:33] with nobody because you're not gonna
[1:43:34] believe it anyway you're gonna come up
[1:43:36] with your side of it we go back to the
[1:43:38] Bible he said in the name it didn't say
[1:43:42] the names of Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:43:45] he said in the name st. Gera
[1:43:50] what is that name senior fathers none
[1:43:54] only goes Lord Jesus Christ we see with
[1:44:00] Catholic Church they took that because
[1:44:02] they knew they'd have to take away that
[1:44:03] name and that was the only way they
[1:44:05] could do it the way they done it was
[1:44:08] taking away the name not making it being
[1:44:11] a different name but took away the
[1:44:13] revelation Jesus was standing there one
[1:44:16] day and he said unless you believe that
[1:44:18] I am he you will die in your sin well
[1:44:24] then he was either Almighty God or the
[1:44:26] greatest deceiver the world had ever had
[1:44:30] then what are we gonna do about it
[1:44:33] well I'll take what Peter says no you're
[1:44:38] taking what the Catholic Church says
[1:44:41] because Peters hid in the name singular
[1:44:45] of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost
[1:44:52] you mean that a man that you give him
[1:44:54] the keys he opens the keys to the
[1:44:56] kingdom Jews and Gentiles oh and he
[1:44:58] can't remember ten days in the time you
[1:45:01] tell him
[1:45:04] Jesus said Father Son and Holy Ghost no
[1:45:07] I didn't deny that that's in the Bible
[1:45:10] because it's hidden from the wise and
[1:45:12] prudent Napoleon this rock I'll build my
[1:45:14] church upon this revelation and Peter
[1:45:16] turned to renter and said they said men
[1:45:19] and brethren what much did he said in
[1:45:22] the name of Jesus Christ
[1:45:27] and Amanda couldn't keep it straight for
[1:45:30] ten days and he's supposed to be the
[1:45:32] leader of the church you mean he
[1:45:36] couldn't remember father son Holy Ghost
[1:45:38] for ten days that it's not even sensible
[1:45:41] is it we see it's the Word of God that's
[1:45:48] the word Jesus is that word let's sing
[1:45:52] another one for it it's gonna be a
[1:45:53] little bit for to get them ready
[1:45:54] downstairs and we we're not gonna be in
[1:45:57] no hurry we take a wild if I rather fish
[1:45:59] in the chicken and honey we want you to
[1:46:01] fellowship together we can do that
[1:46:02] outside and all we're gonna eat inside
[1:46:05] cause it'd be a lot cooler all right
[1:46:07] but then if you want to take yours
[1:46:08] outside you if some of the sisters was
[1:46:12] telling me this morning they didn't know
[1:46:14] how to eat fish I said we'll teach you
[1:46:19] how to eat fish yeah too many bones in
[1:46:23] them if you know how to eat it it's not
[1:46:26] no problems you're not gonna get a bone
[1:46:29] we'll teach you how to eat fish if you
[1:46:32] want to our brothers taught us how to
[1:46:34] catch fish right in the name of Jesus
[1:46:40] that's the way you catch fish let's go
[1:46:46] let's say he ain't God good
[1:47:41] old things are passed away
[1:47:48] make sure you die once you reach into
[1:47:51] magic
[1:47:58] we are
[1:48:03] and we are
[1:48:08] we are
[1:48:17] we are
[1:48:26] children you stay away from where
