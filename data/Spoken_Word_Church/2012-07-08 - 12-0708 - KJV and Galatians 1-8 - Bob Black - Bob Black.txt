TRANSCRIPT
========================================
what's last week's topic on pause for a little bit and it kind of changed Direction um I started I've been reading this this wonderful little book in all thy word and it's like it's a great big huge book but if you okay you can kind of open it up anywhere and the whole topic is the difference between the King James version and and some of the other Bibles so I wanted to talk about the King James version and Galatians 1 8. and uh so turn it uh foreign Galatians chapter one you know I want to kind of go through um what brother Brown said about different Bible versions and um how to know how to how to uh Galatians but um I'm gonna I don't turn we're all familiar with the scripture in Revelation revelation 22 18 19 when it says for I testifying to every man that hears the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add under these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any match will take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book and I've heard people say before that that only applies to the Book of Revelation in other words you can change the other books as long as you don't change Revelation oh it just doesn't make any sense oh this is a I'm reading from revelation 22 but I wanted you to turn into Galatians 1 so I'm going there to say um so what this is really talking about is that the standard that was said at the original in the original has to be the same standard that we're hooking on to the the Pentecostal standard is the same standard we're held to what they're but the original Revelation was that our Revelation that's the match that in the Ephesian Church age brother and said If any man who's reading this scripture If any man shall take away from the words of the book of his prophecy God should take away his part out of the book of life he said thus what the church was at Pentecost is the standard that is the pattern there is no other pattern no matter what the scholars say God has not changed that pattern what God did at Pentecost he has to keep on doing until the church age is closed so to see if we're we got to match ourselves with the original pattern and that's also what um you can kind of compare the uh the King James version and go back through all of the previous versions which is what the translators did to to brother Venom talked about how God protects his word he makes sure that his his word says what it's supposed to say and um so we're going to look at the next 30 minutes that some of the things that by Revelation brother random saw that were not quite right in the King James version and we'll compare it with some of the other verses that are out today um so let's see so Paul's doctoring as a standard now let's read Galatians chapter one and Galatians 1 8 is very familiar to us all but let's kind of set the the stage for Galatians 1. so this letter was written to the churches not one particular church but the churches in galatia to set them straight on some what what had happened was some some different preachers were coming through and saying um just to for example my message is right because I knew Peter or John or I uh say I fished with the prophet or um or anything other than what Paul is fixing to say and this kind of applies to us too what what is our Holy Ghost experience based on is it based on the fact that we go to a certain church or that we um sat under like maybe maybe a particular Minister might say that what I preach is correct because I have I sat under brother so and so for many years but listen to what Paul says Paul an apostle not a man neither by man but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead and all the brother in which are with me unto the churches of galatia Grace be to you and peace from God the father and from our Lord Jesus Christ who gave himself for our sins that he might Deliver Us from this present evil world according to the will of God and our father to whom be glory forever and ever amen I'm Marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ enter another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ but though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you then that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed as we said before so say I now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received let him be a curse so Paul's laying it down but if anybody preaches anything else other than what I preached and and in a second he's going to show you why that when we get to verse 12 for Dua verse 10 for do I now persuade men or God or do I seek to please man for if I yet please men I should not be the servant of Christ but I certify you Brethren at the gospel which was preached to me is not after man it's not something that somebody told me verse 12. for I neither receded a man neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ now you might uh you might say okay well we don't need to fight for Ministry well that's not what he's talking about you need the final Ministry to help you but like for example if I tell you if you're sick and I I could tell you my Revelation I believe that you are healed but until you get that Revelation uh it's and when that Revelation is made personal to you then it can be made manifest in your life so that's what Paul is talking about and that's what um as we go through um uh kind of talking about the different versions of the Bible you can say well if I get the right version of the Bible then I'll understand it but brother random talked about how all down through it when when Christ came on the Earth they they had all of their scriptures laid out just perfectly but they missed him because they didn't have the Revelation so in the in the revelation of Jesus Christ the churches book chapter one he said um now you can see um let me go back however before we get too concerned about this let us read both the King James version and the translation by Dr lonza so our gratification we find the words are both amazingly the same so that there is no difference actually in content or doctrine we may even conclude that God has allowed these newly discovered manuscripts and recent publications of already known scripts to come before us to prove the authenticity of what we already had and we find that though translators May fight each other scripts do not now you can see that you can't base interpretation upon a student's profound knowledge of the language the Bible is written in but if you still can't see that because you are veiled in your mind by tradition here is one last illustration no one can doubt but with the scribes and Pharisees and the great Scholars of the Year 33 A.D knew the exact laws of grammar and the exact meanings of the words in which the Old Testament was written but for all their superb knowledge they miss the revelation of God's promise word manifested in the Sun there he was set forth from Genesis to Malachi with whole chapters devoted to him in his ministry and yet except for a few who are eliminated by the spirit they missed him entirely we now come to a conclusion such conclusion as we have already found in the word as much as we believe in trying to find the oldest and best manuscripts to get the best record of the word possible we will never get the true meaning of it by study and comparison of scriptures since series we may be it will take a revelation from God to bring it out that is exactly what Paul said which things we also speak not in Words which man's Wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost teaches First Corinthians 2 15. the true Revelation that's God interpreting his own word by vindicating what is promised now don't let anyone be mislead about what I've said and think that I did not believe in the accuracy of the words we now have and I believe this Bible is accurate Jesus completely authenticated by the old test the Old Testament one here on Earth and it was compiled as exactly as was our new testament make no mistake about it we have the infallible word of God today and no man there's take from it or add to it but we need the same spirit that gave it to teach it to us oh how we need Revelation by the spirit we don't need a new Bible we don't need a new translation though some are very good and I'm not against them but we need the revelation of the spirit and thank God we can have what we need for God wants to reveal his word to us by his spirit now when you get at revelation I believe um you know my brother Dale's saying say it in your own words so let's look at um a few places in scripture where in the New Testament they said they quoted something in the Old Testament in their own words so we think you know brother Brown said say just say what's on the tapes so uh you know a lot of times I've I've been over to people's houses where they they know I disagree with them so the first thing I come over they hand me a bunch of quotes a stack of quotes So and then we'll wait while I read through them I believe these quotes brother but if I believe we should be able to say it in our own words if you have a revelation of it um so let's look at um well I'll just kind of compare in Romans 10 20 Paul said but Isaiah is very bold and saith I was found of them that sought me not I Was Made manifest unto them that asked not after me and then he's quoting Isaiah 65 that says I have thought of them that asked not for me I'm found of them that sought me not I said behold me behold me unto a nation that was not called by my name in James 4 6 he said but he giveth more grace wherefore he said God resists us the proud but giveth Grace unto the humble and he's quoting Proverbs 3 34. surely he's gone at the scorners but he'd giveth Grace under the lowly it's not a word for word quote he's saying it in his own words in First Peter 2 22 Peter said who didn't know sin neither was God found in his mouth and he's quoting Isaiah 53 9 and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth with first Peter 4 18 Peter said and if the righteous scarcely be saved worse of the ungodly and The Sinner appeared and he's quoting Proverbs 11 31 behold the righteous shall be recompensed on the earth much more than Wicked in the center so the doctrine is the same but different words and Romans 11 8-10 no this is interesting because uh Paul actually takes three different quotes from the box from the Old Testament and combines it all into one statement he says according as it is written God had given them the Spirit of Slumber eyes that they should not see and the ears that they should not hear unto this day and David says let their table we made a snare in a trap on a stumbling block and a recompense unto them let their eyes be darkened that they may not see and bow down their back always and he's quoting Deuteronomy 29 yet the Lord has not given you an heart to perceive and eyes to see and here's the here under this day for the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep and that's close your eyes the prophets and your rulers the serious hath you covered and then he's also quoting Psalms 69 22 23 let their table become a snare before them and that would have said have been for their welfare but it become a trap let their eyes be darker that they see not I make their own ones continue to shake I'm going through this a little fast but all these notes are on the website if you want to print them out or um take a look at them um so our Doctrine maybe you might not say the same words if I asked you to explain one God you might not say the same words that I would but as long as our Doctrine is the same and matches what was the original in the in the beginning Paul's what Paul taught so um let's kind of go through the history of the Bible and uh because I've been uh the history of the translation real quick in in maybe five minutes or so uh so Matthew started writing uh according to historians about four years after Jesus uh we all right yeah I would just saying what you were saying about it you may not beg your words we might not say the same word but we're getting the same thing Don's dad in him when I would talk to them about that about something and they would always try to correct me well I was saying the same thing as them I just wasn't using the words they were using yeah so yeah lots of both of them was talking last night about a Bible study about how people don't listen to what you're saying they will try to come up with our response in our head yeah we're really well he kind of said that's what a Bible meant he said I put it in Vietnam right they brought break it down in little ones so he was leaning there not saying exactly what I say but they're breaking it down for the people right huh excuse me I think that proves you have a revelation when you don't quote what somebody else says right it's not the same thing but it's in your words yeah absolutely exactly you're understanding right right absolutely didn't mean to interrupt yeah no that's fine that was here the attitude of discussion um so uh you know most people say a lot of people say that the scriptures weren't recorded until you know hundreds of years after the after uh Jesus died and rose again but Matthew started writing but just four years after the after he rose and then uh John uh you know he was very old close to a hundred they say um he started his school as a scribe as a copy scriptures down right there and they were written by eyewitnesses and the way they wrote because they all get in a circle around somebody in the middle that would um call out or read the scripture they would all write down maybe a chapter or however a long was predetermined and then it all switched places and they could read again and then go back and double check uh to make sure because they were very concerned that the word was accurate if it was not if one word was off when they double checked it throw that page out and write it again then they went through 10 official Roman persecutions called uh the Odio Humanity generis which is Latin for hate crimes you got that out I I might not have gotten that out I just uh uh and through Nero demetian trading now the mission uh around the time is the one that boiled John and old because the mission took the name Dominus which means Lord and he thought he thought that he was God so he said well John's writing these uh he heard about John putting out these Works about um another lure and he said I'm gonna we gotta do something about him so he bowled him in oil and you can on Wikipedia you can still find a picture of the gate station is still there where he was bowling all right in front of that so he can still visit it visit it but uh you know brother Brown was talking about it what was on the inside of John so permeated his whole being until it it quickened his flesh and they couldn't Bowl it um and then uh in Acts uh on the day of Pentecost the gospel went into all the different nations and they say that the uh one of those Nations was the Goths which uh went into Romania and Bulgaria and uh there was a Gothic a goth uh missionary by the name of wolfula and which means a little wolf and he was ordained by this man named eusebius and he took the gospel to The Goth Goths and this is kind of important to compare the scripture because if you look down uh through all the different Bible translations the gothic Bible was translated around uh It Was Written around 300 A.D so it's one of the earliest Bibles that we can kind of compare against so compare the gothic Bible with the Anglo-Saxon Bible and the Wycliffe Bible Nintendo Bible and the Geneva Bible the Bishops Bible on the King James version and this book if you if you're interested in reading it goes through all the comparisons to show you that little like a lot of these modern day translations that have big pots and houses with their own agenda behind it the the um what is written down lines up so perfectly from all the way from the gothic Bible which is uh goth is really like an early version of the English language so I guess it's the earliest version of English it went from Gothic to Anglo-Saxon to on down to the modern day English so um then we get to the King James version King James was a lot of people a modern day critics say he wasn't a Christian man but he wrote this uh he wrote a book for his son called the basilicum doron that um you know he encouraged his son to count every sin and breach of God's law not according as the vain world esteems of it but as God judge and maker of the law accounts the same he said that all all that is necessary for salvation is contained in the scripture and the whole scripture is dictated by God's spirit and so he said to translate the King James version he set up um he put in he made I think it was 15 or so rules that the translator should fall and put them in different committees and the way that it worked is to eat some media committee would submit suggestions for um updates to the different Source texts that they were looking at and uh the bottom line is after they after they end up reviewing it every word in the Bible got looked at 14 times every word in the Bible because they were just as concerned as they were in John's School of scribes that every word be just perfectly in line and another thing is um and you know in the software world we call Open Source software software where anybody can contribute well this was the first Open Source book because they allowed anybody to contribute it was open to everyone not just uh the the scholars and whatnot but any anybody could say um I've been looking at this particular scripture and I think this you know The Bishop's Bible of the Geneva Bible has this a little bit wrong you could so if you could say you could submit something to the translators they might not use it but they would consider it so it was the first translation that any it was kind of open to the entire to the entire bride and um so now let's look at a few difficulties with the King James version that brother Brandon poured it out the first one is acts 238 you don't have to turn that because we're all familiar with Ben Peter said that they repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for their mission of sins and he shall receive the gift with only gift now who would know this but a prophet that is missing a very key word Lord Jesus Christ because King James version says Jesus Christ but he said um now let me see it I like to hear my sisters and your Brotherhood president Matthew said father son Holy Ghost now if you all go get the emphatic Diagon or the Greek interpretation it happens to be that I have on the side of print now Peter said repent everyone and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the King James version said in the name of Jesus Christ but in the emphatic Diagon it says in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now when you won this brother and just baptize the name of Jesus there's just me and Jesus but there's only one he was born crisis of God that's his name that's what he has Christ means the anointed one Messiah Christ now Jesus eight days later he was given the name Jesus when he was circumcised and he is our Lord so he is our Lord Jesus Christ and the next one is um John 14 2 in my father's house I mean mansions if it were not so I would have told you I get to prepare a place for you now this is not necessarily a mistake it's just something that he clarified for us to help us understand and a lot of modern day translations translate Mansion as room or apartment but the the what is what the thought of it is in his father in The Father's Kingdom were many mansions when brother Reynolds said in the original it said in my father's Kingdom there's many palaces because a house can't how do you get a a house is it like a building house it's the kingdom like how they would speak in the when they were riding the King James version back in King James day and the next is um Revelation 1 12 and let's turn to see the voice and we're all familiar with these I'm just kind of doing overview I turned to see the voice to speak with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and we know brother Ram said that was should be lamp stands because uh it's got to have the same mold in every church and um not just a candle really all right now right Revelation 17 3 so he carried me away in the spirit Into the Wilderness I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet color Beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns and brothers said and why a while I'm against organized religion that it should be full of Blasphemous names and he said uh in return in Jubilee and you see that the King James put it she had names of blasphemy but in the original thy Glide it said she was full of Blasphemous names what a difference from names of blasphemy name's a blasphemy to Blasphemous names that means to me I don't know if I'm wrong God forgive me but it means churches that it took on has took on the names of Christianity that live like the world and act like the world and do the things of the world has brought our disgrace upon the True Church of the Living God and they join those you might join the Methodist large Presbyterian launch of the Pentecostal laws but you cannot join the church you must be born into the church by the baptism of the holy spirit that is true so we read earlier we're talking about Galatians that uh the particular translation is not going to give you the Revelation that the Revelation has to come from God but um a lot of these new translations you got to be careful because the they leave out whole verses and and uh words that change change the doctrine so let's kind of quickly go through um some of the differences and Mark took 13 33 and you don't have to turn on just kind of read the Anglo-Saxon said Watch and Pray Wycliffe said watch you and pray Tyndall said Watch and Pray Geneva said Watch and Pray Bishops watch and pray the King James version says watch and pray but it's changed a little bit in these new versions The NIV says be alert the nasb says keep on the alert get a Cavalry version says stay awake and the Jehovah's Witness version says stay awake instead of watching pray so you miss that watch and pray and uh First Timothy 2 7 where unto I am ordained a preacher an apostle I speak the truth in Christ and why not now in uh I have a long list of different versions that just leave out the in Christ in Luke 2 33 and Joseph and his mother Marvel at those things which were spoken of him and I have another long list of translations that change Joseph to the child's father or Jesus parents or his father and mother for Jesus father and mother see how it's changing is changing the testimony that Joseph wasn't his father dude he was his father so it's not right you gotta be careful and um if you want to compare all these versions a real easy way to do it is to go to www.bible.cc and type in a scripture it'll give you um that scripture in probably 20 different um versions that's a real good study resource that's not.com CC a lot of people are using a lot of websites I started using a cc domain for just to First Christian Church even though that's not originally what it was intended for um Luke 9 55 but he turned and rejected him and said you know not what manner of spirit you are of and a lot of the modern translation is completely removed that part and said you know not what manner of spirit you are of so I've got all these in the note I'm going to skip through some of those um it's just something to be aware of and we're all familiar with the the um thank you this is the fame of the most famous era I guess especially the message Believers it's Matthew 24 28 it says wherever they carcass is they were the Eagles be at the together and almost all the modern translations render Eagles as vultures which changes the meaning a whole lot so uh and then program talked about the emphatic dye gloss and what a diaglot is is where you got um two pages or uh you got your pages put up into two Farms or um something on the left something on the right so they usually have maybe like the grease on the left and the English on the right and a polyglot is a teach me all these fancy words but I probably go out is like more than two so that's why it's called the emphatic dialogue I'm not sure why where the emphatic came from but um so brother Randolph said about the emphatic dog a lot now I've got an emphatic dog out of the original Greek translation it's the one most outstanding things I'd advise it to any of the clergyman it's not a print but I think you can get it in England I'm not sure but I have one that's very old and it brings it down just the original Greek word and it comes over on the other side and just puts it because in the Greek verb is before the adverb you see and it just turns it around so you can read it out you can just read it off if it's one word write down just as he said it um so the in fact dog lot was was published in um in the 1800s by a man that inventional Wilson and he uh the neat thing about the anesthetic diagram is it puts the Greek word by word on the left and then underneath it it was the English translation for each word and then on the right it kind of tells you kind of uh polishes up to English to make it easier to read in a sense so you can go through each word and see what the original Greek meant and um now it originally was um for sale but now it's the copyright has expired so you can get it online for free or you can you can buy uh you can buy one of the original 1900 printing like the one that brother Brandon said he had the leather bound if you can find you can find them on Watchtower the world because the I was gonna say I've actually got a lady that I used to work with who's actually a witness and I've worked with her and she's actually ordered some for me in the three bag lots and so we're waiting for them to come as soon as they come I didn't want to say anything about how many I have could I don't know until we get them and she said that they're supposed to be shipped and they're supposed to be on their way excellent so they take donations so whatever whatever I get I'm gonna bring them and say what are you gonna pay us let's go from there so this is how many I have okay so I thought everybody liked it if you go to the Watchtower store and they have some of the original ones that I use for sale online and they're about 200 each or you can go on to the um to archive.org is this a little print a whole lot of anymore they're mainly on CD yeah they're very rare but um but they have done a new printing machine disorder I think she told me she ordered 20 of them so hopefully we'll get 20. there might be a rush on them but uh I'm just kind of giving y'all some resources if you go to archived over we're going to have a lot it's an archive a free um expired copyright stuff so you can go on there and they have the original 1900 Edition they took pictures of each page that you can flip through or you can download a PDF of it and print it if you've got enough pages um so that's available for free and um I was just I had a few resources at the bottom of this document yeah I know that um some of us don't have the if you have a copy of the table or the other software that lets you search that that is just wonderful I love the table it is kind of expensive but if you don't have it then uh you can go to www.brandom.org and they have a um the voice of God lets you search the all the messages in English Spanish and French and now they've got all the sermons available for free so you can listen to all of them online for free um so I just want to let everybody know that's available
