[0:00] um
[0:01] um Timbo asked me said did you see any
[0:03] deer I said well if it's 80 degrees and
[0:06] your body is 99 covered in hair
[0:09] would you move
[0:11] no you'd find a nice cool place and
[0:14] you'd stay there until dark well that's
[0:16] kind of what happened last last week

[1:54] night so December the 4th is our church
[1:57] standard one service here and then we
[2:00] will go to the Hidden Acres like we
[2:02] always do to have our uh Christmas
[2:05] dinner and it will be catered so you
[2:07] won't have to fix anything all right Dr
[2:09] brother Michael T Friday he said to tell
[2:11] you thanks for prayers but I'm telling
[2:13] you folks
[2:15] he's just down
[2:17] I've never seen Michael down
[2:20] but he's he's he needs prayer
[2:23] uh you can pray for his body all you
[2:25] want to but I've been praying for his
[2:26] self his his psyche his it's just kind
[2:30] of all tore apart it's you know we
[2:32] always even as Christian folks we we
[2:34] still we sometimes we think God why did
[2:37] that happen
[2:38] because we can't see the future we can't
[2:40] see what's going on we don't know we say
[2:42] what Lord why why'd that happen
[2:45] and and he's got a very small church and
[2:47] I told him we would be sending some of
[2:49] our folks down there uh to help him out
[2:52] and they will you know we'll we'll take
[2:54] care of all the finances because he's a
[2:57] very very small Church of 12 15 20
[2:59] people but just pray for him he just
[3:02] sounded really weak and really down but
[3:04] now as far as health-wise he's he's
[3:06] coming up they're they're actually
[3:08] looking next Tuesday
[3:12] Monday or Tuesday he's going back to the
[3:13] doctor and and they're thinking that
[3:15] that thing May heal up by itself
[3:17] and they won't have to do the surgery so
[3:20] praise God for that
[3:22] but he's still got the puncture lung and
[3:24] it's healing up and broke bones and
[3:27] everything that's got to heal
[3:29] and he will be out of commission for a
[3:30] while so we just want to keep him in
[3:32] prayer I'm going to try to slip off
[3:34] maybe one day and go see him I don't
[3:35] know when but he he needs it he needs
[3:37] some mental he needs somebody to hug him
[3:41] so let's hug him with our prayers if you
[3:43] don't if you're not there don't worry
[3:45] about it just hug him with your prayers
[3:46] but we love brother Mike and he's always
[3:48] been just a uh somebody that we can
[3:51] depend on Amen
[3:53] and we know what the devil did he's
[3:55] trying to get rid of all those people
[3:57] amen but he's not no we win
[4:00] we win Sorry Devil let's
[4:04] picture you want to paint we win
[4:06] we always will win so I think that's all
[4:09] the announcements
[4:10] um
[4:11] remember we won't have Bible study the
[4:13] first Saturday in December and we'll
[4:16] have a prayer service if your brother
[4:18] Joe's putting them up on the screen now
[4:19] if you get here early enough to see them
[4:22] we will be having a prayer meeting on
[4:24] December the 10th like we do before
[4:26] special services but I thought we'd go
[4:28] and do that with the holidays coming up
[4:30] and then we've got brother Wayne Lawson
[4:33] coming in he's going to be with us
[4:35] Friday and Saturday night of New Year's
[4:38] so we're gonna have a Friday night
[4:39] service and a Saturday night service
[4:40] just keep those things in your prayers
[4:42] let's bow our heads
[4:44] thank you Lord for the things you give
[4:45] us thank you for the prayers of the
[4:47] Saints Lord thank you for the
[4:48] opportunity that we have to bow our
[4:50] heads Lord and to thank you for all the
[4:52] things that you've given us Lord
[4:54] thank you for this word that you give us
[4:56] Lord that you've illuminated it Lord so
[4:58] much that we we know the very mind of
[5:01] Christ and that's not something out of
[5:03] the Bible That's What Paul told us to do
[5:04] that we need to have the mind of Christ
[5:06] a lot of times Satan gets in and he
[5:09] throws a fog or throws a black shadow or
[5:11] throws a sheet over it but Lord Jesus
[5:14] greater is he that's in us than he
[5:16] that's in this world father I pray today
[5:18] that you would break back the scales off
[5:20] of all of our eyes that we may hear from
[5:21] you father and Lord your name will be
[5:24] magnified today thank you for all the
[5:26] things you give us the people that are
[5:27] here father the ones that are sick the
[5:30] ones that are not with us the ones that
[5:31] are traveling different ones people uh
[5:33] brother Zach and sister Lily Lord as
[5:35] they're starting a new life together I
[5:36] pray that you'd bind them closer
[5:37] together protect them in their little
[5:39] vacation Lord and bring them back home
[5:41] safe father we thank you for all things
[5:43] ask us in Jesus name be brother Aaron
[5:45] Wednesday night Lord amen
[5:47] all right I told you we were going to
[5:49] kind of cut through and that's big
[5:51] enough for y'all to see can you see that
[5:54] okay thank you the power of your thought
[5:57] all right we're going to take this back
[5:59] to where brother Louise was
[6:00] um reading in the uh in Philippians and
[6:03] you want to turn there we go to
[6:05] Philippians 4 but I got it on the screen
[6:06] but I want to weave this into the statue
[6:09] of perfect man because I've told you
[6:10] many many times before
[6:13] being the Lord Jesus in human flesh is
[6:16] not normal
[6:18] in here
[6:19] right oh come on somebody
[6:21] that's not normal
[6:23] that's why they hated Jesus so much he
[6:26] wasn't normal
[6:28] so if you're normal that's why we are
[6:32] separated from the world we don't think
[6:33] like the world we don't act like the
[6:35] world we don't dress like the world why
[6:37] Jesus told us to separate from that
[6:39] thing amen he even said forsake father
[6:42] mother sister brother hey go bury I got
[6:45] to go back let the Dead bear the dead
[6:47] come follow me boy everybody thinks
[6:49] Jesus was some nice guy he wasn't very
[6:51] nice when he come to the word of God and
[6:53] we're going to see today that when it's
[6:55] truth told to you it can be told anyway
[6:58] but if it's truth you got to take it
[7:02] if it's truth and remember Jesus is what
[7:04] the way the truth and the life
[7:07] everything he spoke he spoke the truth
[7:10] you Generation of Vipers
[7:12] oh we hate it when preachers call us
[7:14] names right
[7:17] Jesus didn't have a problem calling
[7:18] snake snake
[7:20] and was looking at him when he said it
[7:23] he wasn't doing it over in the corner or
[7:25] on his Facebook pulpit
[7:28] hello somebody
[7:29] they wasn't on their Facebook Pulpit no
[7:32] he looked at him and he said your
[7:33] daddy's not the same as my daddy you act
[7:36] like your daddy I ain't like mine and
[7:38] they killed him for that and that's what
[7:40] we're heading to in the Statue of
[7:41] perfect man but all these virtues are
[7:44] abnormal to the world
[7:47] Godly virtues now regular virtues yeah
[7:49] the world has a lot of them but I want
[7:51] to talk now and mold it together and
[7:53] show that the power of your thoughts
[7:57] the power of what you think because
[7:59] listen
[8:00] God stood one day and his thought became
[8:05] expressed
[8:07] Let There Be he had to think of it first
[8:09] and then he spoke it right a word is a
[8:12] thought expressed we'll get to that
[8:13] later on in the service so let's go to
[8:15] Philippians 4 verse 4 says rejoice in
[8:18] the lord always that doesn't say always
[8:22] in all way
[8:24] every way rejoice in the Lord some of
[8:28] y'all have already fell off right there
[8:30] that's right you haven't rejoiced a day
[8:33] in your life if you have you need to let
[8:35] your face show it like brother Dale
[8:36] always says
[8:38] and listen if you didn't hear him the
[8:40] first time he's going to tell you again
[8:42] and again I say rejoice
[8:46] let your moderation be known unto all
[8:49] men the Lord is at hand boy that was two
[8:52] thousand years ago how much more now be
[8:54] careful for nothing but in everything in
[8:57] prayer and supplication with what
[8:58] Thanksgiving let your request be made
[9:02] unto God and the peace of God which path
[9:06] this all understanding shall keep your
[9:07] hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus
[9:09] finally Brethren finally here's Paul
[9:11] Paul is summing everything up I like
[9:14] Paul Paul says sums it all up he'll give
[9:16] you a whole chapter or something right
[9:17] at the very end but Michael he'll say
[9:19] this is what I'm talking about
[9:22] he says finally Brethren whatsoever
[9:24] things are true we're going to break all
[9:26] this down a little bit later on whatever
[9:27] things are true whatever things are
[9:29] honest whatsoever things are just
[9:31] whatsoever things are pure watch
[9:34] wherever things are lovely whatsoever
[9:35] things are of good report if there be
[9:37] any virtue and if there be any praise
[9:39] think on these things you baby seated
[9:42] and the Lord has blessing the power of a
[9:45] thought you know there's two forces
[9:47] working today and we can't we can't help
[9:50] it there's two forces in this building
[9:52] today there's two forces in your psyche
[9:55] today doesn't matter if you're born
[9:57] again in your soul Satan still has a
[10:00] spot that he can aggravate you in your
[10:04] spare realm your memory reason conscious
[10:06] affection imagination that's what we've
[10:08] been talking about so this kind of ought
[10:09] to blend in look
[10:12] your soul may be sealed by the baptism
[10:14] of the Holy Ghost sealed until the day
[10:17] of your Redemption but your mind is not
[10:19] your mind is not sealed your mind is
[10:22] what we have to overcome right if you're
[10:24] born again today your soul is already
[10:27] sitting in Heavenly places
[10:29] your soul is already Eternal thank God
[10:32] for a prophet that that Lord will let
[10:34] him go across the curtain of time and
[10:35] see the people that had died we thought
[10:38] they're dead no that's more alive over
[10:40] there than we are here
[10:41] amen you know what I'm saying they
[10:43] didn't want to come he didn't want to
[10:44] come back here he wanted to stay there
[10:46] right so that part inside he used the
[10:49] same thing absolutely well we don't like
[10:51] it when we're separated we don't like it
[10:53] when somebody passes away from this
[10:55] Dimension but the Bible tells us to
[10:58] Rejoice at the death of a saint
[11:01] and cry at the birth of a child we got
[11:04] it totally opposite you know why because
[11:06] that's what we've been taught
[11:08] that's our thoughts
[11:11] I wouldn't bring any of the brothers and
[11:13] sisters that passed away in this
[11:14] building for the past 30 40 years I'd
[11:17] never bring them back for one thing in
[11:19] the world I want them to come back when
[11:21] the resurrection happens amen
[11:23] and I hope we're a part of that right
[11:25] but we've got to get ours I've always
[11:27] said our thinking thinking out of the
[11:28] way we got to quit thinking listen we
[11:31] got to start thinking Heavenly thoughts
[11:33] we listen if we are the Bride of Jesus
[11:35] Christ we gotta start thinking like a
[11:37] bride if we are the Bride of Jesus
[11:39] Christ that has a commission to come to
[11:41] a body change or come to a bringing the
[11:44] dead Saints out of the ground we gotta
[11:45] start thinking that way right
[11:48] so listen
[11:50] Satan and God is in control of our mind
[11:52] all the time there's not one second all
[11:56] of your nerves and all of your all of
[11:58] your body functions your heart your
[12:00] brain all that works and you don't have
[12:02] to think about it right but you do have
[12:05] thoughts that are running in your mind
[12:06] all the time you're not having to think
[12:08] art brain work all right some of you may
[12:11] need to all right Brian drop it sometime
[12:15] may hurt some of us but you don't have
[12:18] to say heartbeat no that's what it's an
[12:21] automatic process but you do have to
[12:23] think
[12:24] you do have to think you do have to make
[12:26] decision you do have to what process
[12:29] that thing in your brain but you don't
[12:31] think with your mind
[12:36] your brain is nothing more than a than a
[12:40] super computer
[12:42] everybody with me because the Bible says
[12:45] you think with your heart
[12:47] out of the heart precedes all things the
[12:50] man thinketh in his heart so is he not
[12:52] as he think it is mine listen it felt if
[12:55] that was true as a man thinketh in his
[12:57] mind so is he we'd all be in trouble
[13:00] I'd be dead brother they'll be dead all
[13:02] the ministers will be dead already
[13:06] well the minister said amen the rest of
[13:07] you didn't
[13:11] well what did that what Daddy tell you
[13:13] he was riding with brother mode all that
[13:15] time going down to to General Motors and
[13:17] he the devil would get in his mind and
[13:18] say
[13:19] make that man drive over there and kill
[13:21] him
[13:22] right that wasn't God that was the devil
[13:26] but he was in his psyche telling him I
[13:29] hate that guy
[13:31] right I hate that guy get rid of it
[13:35] well let's turn the table I hate that
[13:38] devil I hate that guy let's get rid of
[13:41] him because it's the power of your
[13:43] thoughts
[13:45] listen if that same God that's inside of
[13:48] you is the same God that said let there
[13:50] be then that same thought process has
[13:52] got to come to me and you that's right
[13:54] I can't and listen you say well I can't
[13:55] do that there you've already stopped it
[13:58] your massive computer
[14:01] has what your hard drive has just been
[14:04] everything's been stopped all right
[14:06] we're having trouble with the internet
[14:07] still today are we still brother Louise
[14:11] back up something back and forth so blue
[14:13] devil
[14:14] he don't want anybody to hear this what
[14:17] I got to say so let's just preach anyway
[14:19] and then we'll let them work on it back
[14:21] there
[14:22] all right look now what happens in our
[14:24] mind with those two forces do you know
[14:26] think about this I want you to think now
[14:28] think common think outside
[14:31] this room everybody with me all right
[14:33] most of you are anyway
[14:35] so
[14:38] watch that brother Louise is spoke about
[14:42] it some but we don't condone watching
[14:44] certain kind of movies
[14:46] but you watch these movies though
[14:48] they're preparing your mind right for
[14:51] something to come
[14:53] it's Satan Prince why brother Brown said
[14:55] Hollywood was of the devil why because
[14:58] it's preparing same way with politics
[15:00] same way with all the great leaders of
[15:02] the world they're preparing what our
[15:04] mind
[15:06] even the Christian's mind
[15:09] they're programming it what movies about
[15:12] superhumans
[15:14] well it's Satan going to be the world
[15:16] Superman he's going to be able to
[15:18] levitate and maybe move this thing and
[15:20] move it right
[15:22] he'll be Satan Superman he'll be the
[15:24] pope that'll be able to do whatever he
[15:25] wants to do when we're gone out of here
[15:27] but praise God we got a God that's
[15:29] greater than that to send me and you
[15:31] that we're going to do great exploits if
[15:34] we'll get our stinking thinking out of
[15:36] the way think his thoughts not our
[15:38] thoughts
[15:40] because look what happens right here but
[15:42] look as the movies are preparing the
[15:44] people for the future
[15:46] even as we see even the Christian movies
[15:48] a lot of times and and I don't want to
[15:51] be critical but we as a as a bride know
[15:53] that there's no one going to be saved
[15:55] after the Rapture takes place that is
[15:57] not in the Bible can't be in the Bible
[15:59] because the bride is going to leave the
[16:02] earth and the Holy Ghost is leaving with
[16:04] her
[16:04] amen there will be no left behind
[16:08] sorry Kirk Cameron's a good guy and all
[16:10] that was a good movie it was okay but it
[16:12] was false from the beginning
[16:14] you can't get saved after the Rapture
[16:16] takes place the Bible does not support
[16:17] that amen
[16:20] we know that see we know that but what
[16:22] about the world the world watches that
[16:24] movie said well if I don't make it this
[16:25] time I'll just live any way I want to
[16:27] now and then I'll get real serious once
[16:30] I see planes falling out of the sky with
[16:32] no people in them
[16:35] I don't know many born-again Pilots so
[16:37] the prayings are going to still be
[16:38] flying if there is
[16:41] don't be flying on the day of the
[16:42] rapture
[16:44] but there's a lot of things going to
[16:46] happen but the but the world is getting
[16:48] you used to that
[16:50] they're getting you used to going
[16:52] through a tribulation going through a a
[16:54] Mad Max or going through a after
[16:56] apocalypse think about it look at all
[16:59] these that's what they're forming you to
[17:01] continue on as you are and everything's
[17:05] fine and we'll be all right even if you
[17:07] miss it the first time you'll get it the
[17:09] second time no you will not
[17:12] he who's filthy let him be filthy still
[17:15] he who is righteous let him be righteous
[17:17] still that's not to watch on judgment
[17:19] that's at the end time when the bride
[17:22] leaves the Earth
[17:23] am I with me right but now look as the
[17:28] world is tuning us to that or not so
[17:31] much us but the world to that thought
[17:33] can't the word of God do the same thing
[17:36] get the word of God what transform us
[17:39] how many times have I read that by the
[17:42] renewing of our mind
[17:44] getting out of that thinking of the
[17:46] world the stinking thinking and all
[17:47] those things
[17:49] because remember the new birth is the
[17:52] Supernatural part of God in your soul
[17:54] that's Eternal cannot be changed will
[17:56] not be changed not going to be anything
[17:59] um that that and what the great mystery
[18:01] is is you can get the new birth and you
[18:03] still look the same you do now we know
[18:05] that we will change as sisters and
[18:07] brothers we won't do the things we did
[18:08] before
[18:09] but it doesn't take you and morph you
[18:12] into a you all gonna look like Jesus no
[18:16] thank goodness we're not going to do
[18:18] that we're individuals but the new birth
[18:20] changes us supernaturally in our soul
[18:22] but then he it has to work as the statue
[18:26] of perfect man it has to work outward
[18:28] now listen if you've got the devil
[18:30] inside of you which today let me remind
[18:32] you one thing you either got the devil
[18:34] working in your soul today or you have
[18:36] God working in your soul there is no in
[18:38] between
[18:39] you might be in a journey you might have
[18:41] the unclean Spirit drawn out driven out
[18:43] of you but until you're still by the
[18:45] Holy Ghost you're not born again and so
[18:49] that devil will start working his way
[18:51] outward into your five senses remember
[18:54] reasons conscious face and Imagination
[18:56] let's don't worry about don't worry
[18:58] about see taste feel smelling here
[18:59] that's just give to you in the human
[19:01] body for us to what process the world
[19:04] that we live in but listen you can every
[19:07] one of those you can fool
[19:15] we make soap there at the at the honey
[19:19] store and
[19:21] we may hunt or so and that soap smells
[19:24] just like dirt
[19:25] but it comes from a bottle of liquid
[19:27] right
[19:28] right so it will fool you into believing
[19:31] that there's dirt in that in that soap
[19:34] it smells just like dirt
[19:36] but it is not dirt
[19:38] so that can all be your your sensory
[19:40] your your your sea taste feel smelling
[19:42] here that is giving you the contact the
[19:44] world but I would never depend on any of
[19:46] that all right it's kind of highly
[19:50] likely that our memory reason conscious
[19:52] affection imagination doesn't need to
[19:54] always be something we lean towards
[19:56] but it's in that soul
[19:59] let's look right here
[20:02] remember
[20:04] the carnal mind is enmity to God the
[20:07] carnal mind
[20:09] because remember even what got Adam in
[20:12] trouble is he come to a place to where
[20:14] he let his mind
[20:17] come on somebody
[20:18] Adam's Soul did not do what he did
[20:22] that's right in his Spirit realm but see
[20:25] his soul loved Eve
[20:27] they were sold to Soul he loved Eve amen
[20:32] she was a part of him actually that soul
[20:34] that was in her was in him at one time
[20:37] amen
[20:40] when Jesus was on the cross wasn't the
[20:42] soul you have in your come on people
[20:44] think with me that same soul that was in
[20:47] Jesus that covers in you today yeah
[20:49] you're part of
[20:51] part of new things wrong we still have a
[20:53] carnal mind we still live in there
[20:56] junk
[20:57] everybody with me
[20:59] so now remember as we talk about this
[21:01] you think with your brain no
[21:05] you think with your heart
[21:09] but that thought that process has to
[21:11] come from here into here out to here
[21:15] everybody with me brother Brown said
[21:17] what a thought a word is a thought
[21:20] expressed think it then you say it all
[21:23] right so now look watch how Jesus in
[21:27] Matthew 24 44 says therefore be also
[21:30] ready for in such an hour as you think
[21:32] not
[21:34] you think not
[21:36] the son of man cometh everybody's
[21:39] looking like I said before all
[21:40] denominational world they're looking for
[21:42] Jesus to split the skies and come down
[21:45] through the Eastern sky and split the
[21:47] clouds and walk down and just take over
[21:48] listen that's what they expected 2000
[21:51] years ago
[21:53] and he came so humble and so lonely as a
[21:55] baby
[21:56] they thought he was a devil he didn't
[21:58] want any of that stuff that they want
[21:59] him he was different
[22:03] but in the hour you think not that son
[22:06] of man is going to appear yeah that's
[22:08] why they're looking for him why not see
[22:11] him now
[22:14] uncle is coming it's coming now when you
[22:16] see him come from the clouds of Glory
[22:18] he's got what he's got a white wig on
[22:20] and that's judgment
[22:23] he's coming as a judge he's not coming
[22:26] as your king
[22:27] he's coming as your judge
[22:30] hey man
[22:31] we're in the palace with the King
[22:33] because we're the Bride of Jesus Christ
[22:35] so he's telling us to love her and such
[22:36] I know that you think not let's start a
[22:39] man will come
[22:41] listen this in John 5 verse 38. 39.
[22:46] and you have not his word abiding in you
[22:48] now he's talking to the Pharisees listen
[22:50] he's talking to the religious world
[22:54] okay
[22:56] talking to the religious World think
[22:59] about that think on these things
[23:01] and you have not his word abiding in you
[23:03] but but but but man we've got Moses he's
[23:07] our Prophet we read him every day
[23:10] we go to the synagogue we wash our pots
[23:15] you know what they said we be Moses as
[23:18] disciples we be Abraham's children Jesus
[23:22] said if you knew them
[23:24] you know me
[23:28] and you have not his word abiding in you
[23:30] for whom he has sent him you believe not
[23:35] he sent the word of God in the end time
[23:37] through a prophet and people turned it
[23:38] down
[23:41] he's not they're not turning William
[23:43] Branham down they're not turning you
[23:45] down they're turning Jesus Christ now
[23:47] amen look it says look search the
[23:51] scripture
[23:54] not in a quote
[23:56] search the scriptures for in them you
[24:00] think
[24:01] you think
[24:03] you have eternal life
[24:09] look at that word
[24:12] that word think
[24:14] means same
[24:16] suppose
[24:18] seems good
[24:21] be of an opinion
[24:24] there's always two opinions at least
[24:27] to be of an opinion to think or to
[24:29] suppose I think judge doesn't question
[24:31] what were they doing they were judging
[24:33] in their brain in their human brain
[24:35] without the Holy Ghost without God
[24:37] leading them they were what being led by
[24:40] their father the devil the religious
[24:42] people
[24:44] the religious peoples what killed Jesus
[24:46] folks not the people in the streets
[24:51] same as it today
[24:55] John 16 verse 1. these things have I
[24:58] spoken unto you that you should not be
[25:00] offended
[25:03] they shall put you out of the synagogues
[25:05] praise God
[25:07] please put me out of the world
[25:11] don't include me with this world
[25:14] yeah we got problems and issues but as
[25:16] we go up this statue of perfect man we
[25:19] ought to be shedding some of that stuff
[25:20] we ought to be what let that mind which
[25:23] is in Christ being you well who wrote
[25:25] the Bible
[25:27] man no
[25:29] Christ wrote the Bible the Holy Ghost
[25:32] Drew man wrote the Bible so whatever the
[25:35] Holy Ghost was in the Bible that wrote
[25:36] it is in you today if you're born again
[25:39] if you're not if you're just thinking
[25:41] that you are come on somebody you're
[25:44] still of your father the devil
[25:46] sorry about that
[25:50] these things have I spoken unto you that
[25:53] you should not be offended
[25:55] they shall put you out of the synagogues
[25:57] yea the time cometh that whosoever
[26:01] killeth you
[26:02] will think that he doeth God's service
[26:08] whoever killeth you think about that 68
[26:11] million people
[26:13] 68 million Believers let me put it that
[26:16] way not just rank centers Believers 68
[26:20] million were killed by who Catholic
[26:22] Church
[26:24] on their books
[26:26] not hot they don't hide it at all
[26:28] the Crusades was not for Christ
[26:33] it was to conquer Nation
[26:35] right and to get property
[26:40] then remember
[26:42] that mother
[26:44] has got daughters
[26:46] and those daughters are doing the same
[26:48] thing the mother's doing
[26:50] I'm just telling you what the Bible says
[26:52] you will think
[26:59] on the father or me
[27:04] oh it was wonderful to the world
[27:05] Constantine comes and says hey let's
[27:07] take church and state put them together
[27:09] thank you
[27:10] let's go on this Crusade and if you
[27:12] don't do what I say come on if you don't
[27:15] do if you don't believe the way I
[27:16] believe we're going to kill you
[27:18] amen 68 million
[27:21] were killed because of that and they
[27:24] were Christians
[27:27] they were persecuted by Christians
[27:29] so-called
[27:32] and then the Bible tell us to Joy and
[27:35] that persecution that's right in other
[27:36] words take joy that somebody is offended
[27:39] by you amen praise God Jesus said he
[27:43] offended people all the time
[27:46] but remember like I said what I said
[27:48] before remember he was telling them the
[27:50] truth
[27:52] you Generation of Vipers it's like oh
[27:54] he's cutting them down no he's telling
[27:56] them the truth
[27:57] you got to look back to the truth
[28:00] as Paul said his brother Dale always
[28:02] said have I what have I hurt your
[28:03] feelings because I told you the truth
[28:07] well you could have said it a different
[28:08] way Jesus didn't
[28:10] he said you're of your daddy I'm my
[28:12] daddy
[28:13] that's right yeah you're gonna act like
[28:15] him and I'm Gonna Act Like Mine
[28:18] so now Romans 12 verse 1 says I beseech
[28:21] you therefore Brethren by the mercies of
[28:22] God this is one we've been reading that
[28:24] you present your bodies a Living
[28:25] Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[28:28] is your reasonable service and be not
[28:30] conformed to this world
[28:32] Cosmos world order we have to live in
[28:35] this world we have to why we have to be
[28:37] human beings we have to work we have to
[28:38] be we're married we have children we
[28:40] have problems we have issues am I
[28:42] talking to the right people
[28:45] but God is walking in your flesh and
[28:50] your soul trying to get us what to renew
[28:54] our mind
[28:55] to get out of the fog that Adam put us
[28:58] in
[29:00] come on somebody Adam put us in this fog
[29:02] he didn't Adam did
[29:07] right people the message hate that they
[29:08] hate Eve no you better not hate Eve
[29:11] because you're evil
[29:13] if you hate Eve then you're dead as much
[29:15] as she's dead
[29:16] you better believe that the second Adam
[29:18] is restoring us back the first Adam
[29:21] killed us the second Adam is what's
[29:24] restoring us back amen
[29:28] that you present your body as a Living
[29:30] Sacrifice so it has something to do it
[29:31] does have something to do with your body
[29:32] you need to dress do right holy
[29:34] acceptable unto God which is your
[29:36] reasonable service and be not conformed
[29:38] to this world but be transformed what by
[29:40] the renewing of your mind your thought
[29:42] your thought process
[29:45] that you may prove what is that good and
[29:47] acceptable and perfect will of God for I
[29:49] say through the grace
[29:53] press it through the grace given to me
[29:56] to every man that is among you not to
[29:59] think
[30:01] of himself more highly than he ought to
[30:05] think a lot of preachers in this message
[30:07] need to read that a few more times they
[30:09] think they're so much higher than
[30:10] everybody else they can't be touched
[30:12] they can't be everybody's shaking their
[30:14] head because you've seen them
[30:16] we're servants
[30:19] we're servants
[30:24] that's why I've told you you can spend
[30:27] you can spend a million dollars on
[30:29] brother Dale
[30:31] and if you don't live what he preached
[30:33] it ain't worth a dime
[30:36] but if he can see the fruits of what
[30:38] he's preached over all those years come
[30:40] to fruition and people come up that
[30:41] statue of perfect man and come to the
[30:43] body chains and come to a place to where
[30:46] you do live a Christian life not just
[30:47] some halfway something out in the world
[30:50] but live it right greatest gift you'll
[30:52] ever get
[30:55] so don't think of himself more highly
[30:58] than he ought to think
[31:00] but to think soberly according as God
[31:03] hath dealt to every man The Measure of
[31:06] Faith all right look First Corinthians 4
[31:08] verse 6. and these things brother and I
[31:10] have in a figure transferred to myself
[31:12] into Apollos for your sake that you
[31:15] might learn in us not to think of men
[31:19] above that which is written
[31:23] that no one of you be puffed up for one
[31:26] against another that's why we have to be
[31:29] careful when we talk about the prophet
[31:31] and the end time he was not God
[31:34] he was born in sand shaping and iniquity
[31:36] he needed salvation but he had a gift
[31:39] he had a gift of God that was unique
[31:42] that was given to us in Malachi 4 Luke
[31:45] 17 30 Revelation 10 7. we can identify
[31:48] him in the Bible these people that hold
[31:50] him above God or hold him as God they're
[31:52] wrong absolutely
[31:55] I give him honor no doubt but he showed
[31:58] me Jesus Christ he didn't show me him
[32:00] he showed me who the Lord was he showed
[32:03] me the Bible more than any other person
[32:05] could show you the Bible
[32:07] but remember whatever you think about
[32:09] him you can cut it off
[32:11] look watch this for if a man think
[32:13] himself to be something when he is
[32:15] nothing he doesn't deceive the people
[32:18] he's deceiving himself
[32:21] for if a man think himself to be
[32:23] something
[32:24] when he's nothing
[32:27] he deceiveth
[32:28] himself
[32:30] wow the power
[32:32] of your thoughts
[32:34] the power of what you think every day
[32:37] like I said before right now today
[32:40] since I've been into pulpit
[32:42] you have thought
[32:45] thousands of thoughts
[32:48] among all of you
[32:49] some of you are buying groceries some of
[32:51] you are figuring out what you're going
[32:53] to do tomorrow some of you are wanting
[32:54] to eat that good food it's down below my
[32:56] feet and your feet
[32:58] some of you are wishing that we get this
[33:00] thing over with that we can go do
[33:01] something else and some of you are
[33:03] thinking about the Lord
[33:05] Proverbs 23 7 says for as he thinketh in
[33:08] his heart
[33:10] so is he
[33:13] look
[33:14] eat drink and eat and drink saith he to
[33:17] thee but his heart
[33:19] is not with thee those disciples
[33:23] well Pharisees
[33:25] and the ones that the the the Sadducees
[33:27] to All Around Jesus they they wanted oh
[33:30] they loved him
[33:32] to a point
[33:34] but when he started saying I my father
[33:36] won you're of the devil and I'm of God
[33:37] when he started separating by the word
[33:40] not by his thoughts
[33:42] but by the word when he starts separate
[33:44] they hated him because remember their
[33:46] heart was not with him that's right
[33:48] their heart thinking in their heart
[33:49] listen confessing them they wanted him
[33:52] dead for a long time read the Bible you
[33:53] keep reading back and listen they even
[33:55] when Lazarus did
[34:00] not people the religious world if we
[34:03] presented 20 people then raised from the
[34:06] dead
[34:06] by us praying for the sick as the Bible
[34:08] tells us to do deaths raise you present
[34:11] them to the denominational world and
[34:12] they're like what
[34:14] who are you
[34:16] because their heart's not with us
[34:18] their heart their thinking well you
[34:21] didn't do that they weren't really dead
[34:22] he uh you know brother Brown was wrong
[34:25] here you're wrong and you've said this
[34:26] wrong you said that wrong
[34:30] as a man thinketh in his heart
[34:33] so is he
[34:35] so let's break this down just a little
[34:37] bit if that's all right
[34:38] but now look
[34:42] even Galatians back where we were
[34:43] reading here I was thinking about uh
[34:45] yesterday
[34:46] if a man thinks himself to be something
[34:48] when he's nothing he deceives himself
[34:49] think of all the people Adolf Hitler
[34:53] Stalin amen
[34:55] Satan himself
[34:57] he thought he could get a better Kingdom
[35:00] that's why he had to separate from God
[35:03] was because of his thoughts listen Satan
[35:06] is not going to ever curse
[35:09] Satan don't say curse words
[35:12] Satan don't stay out of church
[35:16] Satan's not this
[35:20] he's slick he's sitting right beside you
[35:28] and he's given you religious thoughts
[35:35] contrary to the word of God
[35:39] that's where he wins he don't win by
[35:41] making you curse like I said before hey
[35:43] the the the largest and the greatest
[35:47] drug dealers in this world why is that
[35:49] showing on yours not showing on mine the
[35:52] Lord the greatest drug dealers on the
[35:55] face of this Earth never
[35:57] takes drugs
[36:01] never
[36:02] they want to be focused they want to be
[36:05] sharp they know that their mind will get
[36:07] all muddled up when you see that they're
[36:09] not the Kingpin
[36:11] the Kingpin is the Untouchable guy the
[36:13] guy that they can't get That's what
[36:15] Satan is he's letting his little minions
[36:17] do his job and he's sitting up here
[36:20] going I'm going to be like God and God
[36:22] don't curse her I'm not going to curse
[36:24] have I thought about that before yes if
[36:26] he wants to be like God
[36:27] he says I'm not going to curse
[36:30] because God don't curse I'm not going to
[36:33] stay out of church because Jesus don't
[36:34] stay out of church
[36:36] we think of this and the devil's been
[36:38] way out trying to somewhere and he's
[36:39] some nasty something looks like you know
[36:41] he's got guts and blood and all that
[36:42] stuff all over him and he's some kind of
[36:43] uh two-horned demon
[36:47] he was beautiful God made him beautiful
[36:53] he knows how to worship
[36:56] he knows how to get a presence
[37:00] he knows how to get an audience
[37:02] he's slick
[37:06] so Adolf Hitler you think of all those
[37:09] people that always thought they were
[37:11] some great something they came to what
[37:13] look at their horrible end that they
[37:14] came to
[37:16] all those people they they thought that
[37:18] they were the what Hitler thought he was
[37:20] God he was going to just take over
[37:22] you know don't you can't touch me well
[37:24] he figured out one thing's for sure
[37:27] he either got touched or he touched
[37:29] himself because he ain't with us no more
[37:32] he fell very hard
[37:35] now look
[37:37] I want you to think about this we're
[37:38] going to go through these words
[37:40] let's go back to Philippians 4.
[37:43] let's look for a second right here
[37:47] Philippians 4 verse 4.
[37:50] watch this
[37:52] rejoice in the Lord all way in other
[37:54] words every way not just always every
[37:56] way and I say again Rejoice let your
[37:59] moderation be known unto all men the
[38:00] Lord is at hand be careful for nothing
[38:03] but in everything by prayer and
[38:05] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[38:06] request be made known unto God in other
[38:09] words change your thinking

[38:15] just pure lovely good report is there
[38:20] any negative to that
[38:23] virtue there be any praise think on
[38:25] these things what does that first word
[38:28] which is true the word true means what
[38:31] true obviously truly loving the truth
[38:37] speaking the truth
[38:39] truthful Everything Jesus said was the
[38:43] truth
[38:44] amen and they hated him
[38:48] we don't even like you to be in our
[38:50] church
[38:52] praise God
[38:54] that's what that man said one time he
[38:55] said throw me out I've been throwed out

[38:59] the next one is honest
[39:02] honest grave sober

[39:20] Commandments of God Paul is not just
[39:23] throwing words out here he's telling us
[39:25] how to live by these virtues
[39:28] he's just not calling him
[39:30] virtue knowledge Temperance faces
[39:31] Godless brother kindness but he is
[39:33] putting it right here in this scripture
[39:34] he's telling us every one of those
[39:36] virtues all right
[39:39] I want you to look at this right here
[39:44] now we're talking back
[39:46] just right
[39:50] who puts the most guilt on you
[39:54] take your finger if I take your finger
[39:57] don't you point up here at me
[39:58] don't blame me for this take that finger
[40:01] and go
[40:04] I want everybody to see it on camera
[40:07] [Music]
[40:08] I'll help you
[40:12] hear me look
[40:15] used of him whose way of thinking
[40:17] feeling and acting is what wholly
[40:19] conform to the will of God not your will
[40:23] and who therefore needs no rectification
[40:27] in the heart or life in other words
[40:30] God is God yes a Christian is a
[40:34] Christian and these virtues will
[40:36] validate or Rectify all your wrongs
[40:42] when I say all I don't mean all you're
[40:44] not going to have where you you don't
[40:46] Arthur's still going to live with you
[40:48] Arthur's going to sleep with you
[40:51] and those of you that don't have Arthur
[40:52] yet you will get him
[40:55] I'm talking about arthritis
[40:58] thank God there'll be no arthritis in
[41:00] heaven
[41:01] approved of or acceptable of God
[41:06] whoever
[41:08] it's pure just watch this pure watch
[41:11] this
[41:12] whichever things are pure chaste clear
[41:14] clear look exciting reverence I wish
[41:18] somebody would
[41:20] amen
[41:21] somebody do that
[41:27] this is not exciting reverence
[41:33] unless you're praying
[41:35] but you can't Pray when you're going
[41:40] look exciting reverence venerable Secret
[41:44] do you come to church
[41:47] and think these things
[41:49] look pure from carnality
[41:52] chaste modest look Immaculate if you
[41:57] want the definition of Immaculate go to
[41:59] my mama's house
[42:01] yeah right and the ones that's been
[42:04] there says
[42:05] thank you
[42:07] so there is a definition of these words
[42:09] that we can compare to
[42:13] now the next one says clean now you can
[42:15] go to most everybody else's house is
[42:16] clean but immaculate's a little bit
[42:18] different to clean all right
[42:22] so Paul said look whatever so
[42:24] everything's are lovely acceptable
[42:25] pleasing
[42:27] is there any negative to this I'm
[42:28] reading you
[42:30] no nothing
[42:31] good report some of us cannot do that
[42:37] I'm gonna read you something in a few
[42:38] minutes
[42:40] science tells you that your brain
[42:43] cannot interpret negative impulses it
[42:46] does not know what to do with it
[42:49] you're the one that formulates that in
[42:52] yourself
[42:54] your brain is not capable to have
[42:56] negative thoughts
[42:57] because we were made in the image of God
[43:00] Adam that
[43:01] Adam before the fall clear minded
[43:06] move tree
[43:08] we don't need that over here that
[43:11] mountain would look real good over there
[43:12] and you see him
[43:13] [Music]
[43:17] good report sounding well watch a good
[43:20] report
[43:21] uttering words of good omen
[43:24] speaking auspiciously or speaking
[43:27] positively
[43:29] and knocks a lot of us out right there
[43:32] virtue is praise a virtuous course of
[43:35] thought
[43:36] feeling in action moral goodness
[43:40] if I put anything in here that's wrong
[43:42] negative any particular moral Excellence
[43:46] as modesty impurity and then Paul tells
[43:49] us if there be any praise what approval
[43:52] conduct condemnation
[43:56] commendation
[43:58] we get that mixed up just like I just
[44:00] did
[44:04] there you go the word think this word
[44:07] think where it says think on these
[44:09] things comes from the alert word
[44:11] can you say that
[44:14] look anyway that's where the word logic
[44:18] comes from
[44:19] okay everybody with me it's a Greek word
[44:22] and she's she's Greek background's Greek
[44:24] or her family's Greek and background it
[44:26] is who she is but that comes from the
[44:28] word logic so think
[44:30] be logical
[44:32] look to take into account to make an
[44:34] account of metaphorically to pass to
[44:37] one's account our problem is here we are
[44:40] as human beings and remember brother
[44:42] round talks about being putting things
[44:44] in Jesus when when you get born again he
[44:47] puts an account in your in your bank he
[44:51] put some stuff in it
[44:53] all right he says all right checks for
[44:55] it right
[44:57] what our problem is
[45:00] is we have so much negative in our bank
[45:02] there's nothing positive can come out of
[45:05] it
[45:08] I'm talking about all of us
[45:11] a thing is reckoned as or to be
[45:14] something as in or as availing for or
[45:18] equivalent to something as having the
[45:21] light force and weight to reckon inward
[45:24] think inward
[45:26] as a man thinketh in his heart so is he
[45:29] count up or weigh the reasons to
[45:32] deliberate that's our problem I like
[45:35] what brother Ernie always said he said
[45:37] sometimes our mouth gets in gear
[45:39] before our brain does
[45:46] afraid of me
[45:49] it's like a four inch pipe you know the
[45:51] the four inch PVC pipe it's from your
[45:55] brain to your mouth and there's nothing
[45:57] there to
[45:59] Hold It Back
[46:01] free flow thank you we as of us didn't
[46:03] know that
[46:04] um
[46:06] we're the ones saying it
[46:08] but
[46:10] stop and think
[46:12] before you speak I've got to learn to do
[46:15] that
[46:16] we've all got to learn to do that but
[46:18] some of us more than others
[46:20] don't lay hands on men suddenly so don't
[46:23] think suddenly
[46:25] but look by Reckoning up
[46:34] it's just pure lovely good report virtue
[46:36] praise store those up in your bank then
[46:39] when you need them you can pull it out
[46:41] and you can give it to somebody same way
[46:43] with virtue what our problem is is we
[46:46] Bank up negative so what's going to come
[46:48] out negative
[46:51] to determine to purpose to decide I like
[46:54] that one says to judge when you think
[46:56] you judge
[46:57] think on these things you're judging
[47:00] whether you want to think that or not
[47:02] think that
[47:04] and listen
[47:07] this world
[47:10] is not
[47:13] a world
[47:15] that you can depend on
[47:17] everything
[47:22] oh yeah we well you know the doctor says
[47:24] yeah you know you go to you go to an
[47:25] herbalist and they say all right you
[47:27] need to take these herbs right
[47:28] okay then then you you all of a sudden
[47:32] you get a little sitting you go to the
[47:33] regular MD that is big Pharma is behind
[47:36] him
[47:37] come on somebody big Pharmacy is behind
[47:39] him that they're they're they're saying
[47:41] hey you need to give this to your people
[47:42] with blood pressure well he you know
[47:44] what he's going to say about them
[47:46] midnight
[47:48] they're crazy
[47:50] these over here going well now they're
[47:52] going to say we're crazy but
[47:54] see so you gotta judge which one's right
[47:57] and wrong same way today you've got a
[47:59] judge and filter out things in the world
[48:01] things in the Bible
[48:06] because there's things in the Bible that
[48:07] talks about the devil and stuff you got
[48:09] to discern that out that talks about the
[48:10] mother that talks about the
[48:13] sorry the daughters that's why we had to
[48:15] have a prophet so we can discern those
[48:17] things
[48:18] it wasn't that he just discerns the
[48:20] thoughts and intents of people's heart
[48:22] he gave you the opportunity to discern
[48:24] the Bible yes right
[48:27] listen what brother Brown says
[48:30] 1962 sir we will see Jesus
[48:33] now what is a word
[48:35] a word
[48:37] is a thought expressed
[48:40] you got to think it before you say it
[48:42] you have to think it before you say it
[48:44] and in the beginning was the word and
[48:46] the Word was with God and the Word was
[48:48] God and if the word ever was God it's
[48:51] still God see it and the Word was made
[48:54] flesh and walked among us we've been
[48:55] reading that over and over for 60
[48:57] something times
[48:58] the word was made flesh and dropped
[49:00] Among Us the word of God was made flesh
[49:02] Among Us in Christ Jesus you believe
[49:03] that now he was the word made flesh
[49:07] so we know that a word is a thought
[49:10] first and then what it becomes what
[49:12] thought
[49:13] an expression
[49:16] so there's a lot of things in our brain
[49:17] in our brain that we think of we should
[49:19] never express
[49:21] everybody with me say Amen okay why but
[49:25] you know what we need we need these
[49:27] things because you remember look at
[49:28] Peter
[49:29] Peter was the same way I am he had a six
[49:33] inch pipe from his brain to his mouth
[49:36] hey man he was always shooting off the
[49:39] mouth they said he had a foot shaped
[49:40] mouth because he kept his chewing it all
[49:42] the time
[49:44] but after he got born again come on
[49:47] somebody he changed he changed so much
[49:51] to God had him write this in II Peter
[49:54] to tell you you can do it Peter went
[49:58] from cutting people's ears off yeah he
[50:01] wanted to fight all the time hey he was
[50:03] a sailor
[50:05] he probably used some sailor languages
[50:07] before God took hold of him and Jesus
[50:10] called him you know what Jesus didn't
[50:12] call him when he was in church
[50:15] he called him out of a boat
[50:18] said come follow me
[50:20] I know you're doing those things shut up
[50:22] Peter I'm with you I'm praying for you
[50:24] remember he said Satan I know it's going
[50:25] to sift you like Sam but I prayed for
[50:27] you Peter thank God
[50:30] God prayed for us
[50:32] in John 17 he prayed for us that we make
[50:35] it and we're going to make it Proverbs
[50:38] Proverbs 12 verse 18 says there is that
[50:40] speaketh like the piercing of a sword
[50:42] but the tongue of the wise uh the tongue
[50:44] of the wise we always talk down on the
[50:46] tongue well it ain't always bad
[50:51] the tongue of the wise is health
[50:55] the lip of Truth
[50:57] shall be established forever
[51:01] but a lying tongue is but for a moment
[51:05] deceit is in the heart not the brain
[51:09] the heart of them that imagine evil but
[51:12] to the counselors of peace is joy
[51:19] we need to look at that word Joy a
[51:21] little bit more
[51:22] we need to have more joy than we do
[51:25] like us for us it's a drudgery for you
[51:27] to be a Christian you're not one
[51:29] I said a drudgery
[51:32] if you have to make yourself do
[51:33] something you're just making yourself do
[51:35] something
[51:37] but it's got to be a desire like I said
[51:38] like the Bible says it's got to be
[51:40] something full of joy
[51:42] full of joy even though listen even
[51:45] though we make mistakes find the joy in
[51:47] it
[51:48] negative people can't do that
[51:53] they can't find a joy nothing
[51:57] Proverbs 15 verse 2 the tongue of the
[51:59] wise here we go again the tongue of the
[52:02] wise uses knowledge all right
[52:06] but the mouth of fools poureth out
[52:08] foolishness as a man thinketh in his
[52:11] heart so is he
[52:12] that portal that you got right in front
[52:14] of your face down below your nose
[52:19] the eyes of the Lord are in every place
[52:21] beholding the good and the evil are evil
[52:23] and good a wholesome tongue
[52:27] all that come man that's the tongue is a
[52:30] bad thing he's not saying it right here
[52:33] a wholesome tongue is a tree of life
[52:36] but perverseness therein is a breach in
[52:40] the spirit Proverbs 18 21 death and life
[52:43] are in the power of the tongue
[52:46] and they that love it either way
[52:50] shall eat the fruit thereof
[52:54] listen to this
[52:58] this is Jesus talking again Matthew 12.
[53:01] either make the tree good and it's fruit
[53:03] good or else make the tree corrupt and
[53:05] it's fruit corrupt for the tree is known
[53:08] by its fruit
[53:09] oh Generation of Vipers how can you
[53:12] being evil
[53:15] speak good things
[53:17] listen folks they spoke good things in
[53:20] that Tabernacle
[53:22] everybody with me in their daily Journey
[53:25] they had to do the right thing you know
[53:27] do the incense they had to put the right
[53:28] sacrifice they had to do but all they
[53:30] were doing was it was a ritual
[53:36] and if you live this message as a
[53:37] rituals you got the same generation of
[53:39] operas
[53:42] it's a life it's not a lifestyle right
[53:45] it's a life
[53:48] oh Generation of Vipers how can you be
[53:50] evil speak good things for out of the
[53:52] abundance of the heart yes the mouth
[53:55] speaketh
[53:56] a good man out of the good Treasure of
[53:58] the heart bringeth forth good things and
[54:01] an evil man out of the evil treasure
[54:03] bringeth forth evil things but I say
[54:04] unto you that Every Idle Word now stop
[54:08] there just a minute how many of you I'm
[54:09] not going to let you see the definition
[54:10] of that because it's not going to be
[54:12] what you think
[54:15] okay
[54:16] it's not that we joke and cut up which
[54:18] we we can but not you know in good taste
[54:21] it's not that
[54:23] oh you just you just all the time you're
[54:25] joking that ain't what that means
[54:30] that's not what that means
[54:32] Every Idle word that men shall speak
[54:35] they shall give an account thereof
[54:38] in the day of judgment
[54:40] all right let's see what that word idle
[54:41] means
[54:45] slow
[54:47] barren
[54:50] in other words lies
[54:53] free from labor at leisure
[54:59] lazy
[55:02] shunning the labor which went ought to
[55:04] perform
[55:06] in other words if your words don't
[55:08] become fruitful
[55:10] they're Idle Words I'm talking about in
[55:12] this Pulpit I'm talking about oh yeah
[55:14] there's somewhere I'm talking about out
[55:15] in your job I'm talking about you at
[55:17] Walmart with a girl how many of you let
[55:19] me ask you a question don't raise your
[55:21] hand please I don't want anybody to get
[55:22] embarrassed
[55:25] how many of you
[55:27] when somebody opens the door for you say
[55:29] God bless you
[55:31] when somebody does something for you
[55:33] even at Walmart I don't care if they got
[55:34] tattoos and and earrings and and you
[55:37] know dress up to their belly button
[55:41] I say God bless you thank you
[55:43] you have a good day
[55:47] now I'm gonna get real this is gonna be
[55:49] bad
[55:50] but I'm gonna do it anyway
[55:52] when you go to a restaurant
[55:54] how many of you tip
[55:58] there's a lot of message Believers sit
[56:00] somewhere in the like the 1100 sermons
[56:02] brother Brown so you don't have to tip
[56:03] nobody
[56:05] June how many times have we been out to
[56:07] eat with people not here in this church
[56:08] well maybe some uh you can figure out
[56:10] who that is that just gets up from the
[56:13] table and walks off
[56:16] and we that
[56:18] Mom we have to scrounge around
[56:21] I'm a Preach Today We have to scrounge
[56:24] around and get an extra 10 or a 20 to
[56:27] make that tip
[56:29] you say why why what about all them just
[56:32] people out there that
[56:33] they're humans just like you are let me
[56:35] read that Bible where it said you thank
[56:37] yourself more than you're somebody else
[56:38] then what you're wrong
[56:41] you never know what them people are
[56:43] going through you never know what they
[56:45] look they may be crying but she's
[56:47] bringing your food she may have a baby
[56:49] this sick she might have a mother that
[56:50] died she might have she may have don't
[56:52] have anything
[56:56] June and I we tip 20 percent
[56:59] pretty much 99.9 percent of the time
[57:02] because you know what that's their wages
[57:04] that's their life
[57:06] they have picked
[57:08] they have picked that profession and you
[57:11] know what you're sorry Heinen wouldn't
[57:13] get served if it wasn't for them people
[57:15] so think of them as human beings well
[57:18] they're not bright I can tell that well
[57:20] you might not be either with that
[57:21] attitude
[57:24] but look I'm the worst lazy shining the
[57:28] labor which ought to be we are the labor
[57:30] as Christians every day
[57:33] man absolutely to make this world better

[58:45] walked off well guess what I did I took
[58:47] the thing and walked back over and put
[58:48] it up
[58:50] but listen but you know what
[58:53] that's what we're supposed to be
[58:56] Look what Jesus did
[59:01] he hung around sinners
[59:04] prostitutes
[59:08] didn't wash his hands when he eat
[59:10] praise the Lord

[59:18] you know who was that though that was
[59:19] the religious people of the world well
[59:21] you're he thinks he's God he don't wash
[59:25] his hands
[59:26] before he eats
[59:30] Jesus in other words Jesus kind of just
[59:32] looked up at him and went right on he
[59:34] never said another word
[59:35] but when he got to a place where he
[59:37] could he let him have it
[59:39] yeah lazy shiny less word Idol so Every
[59:42] Idle Word
[59:43] that men shall speak they shall give an
[59:46] account thereof in the day of judgment

[59:51] have a sense of humor that ain't got
[59:52] nothing to do with that Idol Idol is
[59:54] words you speak that has no value

[1:02:30] entertaining your gift that's what we do
[1:02:33] with the Devil

[1:02:54] luck
[1:02:55] I can't help the thoughts from coming
[1:02:58] well that's like the farmer that said he
[1:03:00] couldn't stop the birds from flying over
[1:03:01] his place but he could sure stop him
[1:03:04] from roosting
[1:03:06] now let me read you one
[1:03:09] listen to this
[1:03:11] 1955 blind barter mess brother around
[1:03:14] said don't think sitting there in a
[1:03:16] wheelchair and he's talking about people
[1:03:17] in a wheelchair
[1:03:18] don't think you in a wheelchair that
[1:03:20] you're hopeless
[1:03:21] that you're helpless you're not
[1:03:25] don't let that negative thought ever
[1:03:27] pass through
[1:03:30] the anchor
[1:03:31] you can't help it from going through
[1:03:33] your mind but don't let it stop like the
[1:03:36] old farmer said I can't keep the birds
[1:03:38] from flying over my place but he had a
[1:03:41] double barrel shotgun
[1:03:42] praise God I said I can sure keep him
[1:03:46] from roosting
[1:03:48] so you do the same thing
[1:03:50] now here's the shotgun
[1:03:54] the New and Old Testament there's your
[1:03:59] dad with Buckshot that'll blow the devil
[1:04:02] away if your lady must stand to our feet
[1:04:04] so don't let those negative thoughts
[1:04:10] don't let those negative thoughts
[1:04:13] be entertained
[1:04:16] they're going to come
[1:04:19] just don't entertain them
[1:04:21] don't entertain them don't be don't be
[1:04:24] captivated
[1:04:25] that's what this world wants that's why
[1:04:27] you know this world we spend more money
[1:04:29] now on entertainment than anybody in the
[1:04:32] world
[1:04:33] the United States of America spends more
[1:04:35] money on entertainment than anybody in
[1:04:38] the world does we want to be entertained
[1:04:41] we want somebody to entertain us we
[1:04:42] don't want a preacher to stand and talk
[1:04:44] to us we want him to jump up and down
[1:04:46] and shout and well then I wasn't going
[1:04:48] to everybody at least I did
[1:04:50] that's because what that's what we feel
[1:04:54] that's what makes you feel good
[1:04:59] they weren't many people felt good when
[1:05:00] Jesus got up and started preaching yeah
[1:05:02] yeah because he told them the truth
[1:05:05] amen amen
[1:05:07] he told him the truth that's why I said
[1:05:08] truth is here
[1:05:10] right all right now ever how you process
[1:05:12] it
[1:05:13] like brother Brown said those two women
[1:05:15] walked outside right
[1:05:17] he said oh he called me a buzzard that
[1:05:20] other girl looked at him listened to the
[1:05:22] same sermon said well he called me an
[1:05:23] eagle it's just the way you look at it
[1:05:25] right
[1:05:26] but he's got to stay with truth though
[1:05:29] don't think that we get in that we you
[1:05:31] know we've got all these rules that you
[1:05:33] got to follow
[1:05:35] no it's a life
[1:05:37] paraded life that's what God wanted he
[1:05:40] wanted them to separate himself from the
[1:05:43] world separate themselves from Evil
[1:05:45] separate themselves from non-truths
[1:05:48] that's what he was trying to get when he
[1:05:49] said you Generation of Vipers
[1:05:53] you know what he was saying you people
[1:05:56] have other people
[1:05:58] looking up to you
[1:06:00] and you're acting this way
[1:06:03] right amen remember what he said he said
[1:06:05] by your traditions
[1:06:07] you've made the word of God of no effect
[1:06:09] to the people
[1:06:11] because they were looking at their
[1:06:12] traditions
[1:06:15] as long as I don't look at that as long
[1:06:17] as I look at that woman I'm lust after
[1:06:19] but as long as I don't touch her I'm
[1:06:21] fine Jesus discerned that thought in
[1:06:24] what in their heart
[1:06:27] he saw that thought and they're coming
[1:06:29] from their heart that they wanted to do
[1:06:30] it but they didn't want nobody to see it
[1:06:33] Jesus said buddy you've already
[1:06:35] committed adultery with her in your
[1:06:37] heart and you'll give an account of
[1:06:39] today a judgment
[1:06:40] amen God bless you let's sing a song
