[18:32] hallelujah praise the Lord at the cross
[18:35] a man that was first one of the first
[18:38] songs I learned when I came to the Lord
[18:39] at 12 years old
[18:40] in the Baptist Church at the cross I let
[18:46] brother Wade know so he told me to take
[18:48] a few minutes just right before he comes
[18:50] out but I wanted to give a follow-up a
[18:53] testimonial about something that I
[18:55] talked about on Wednesday all right the
[19:10] brother brother Eric the brother who we
[19:12] helped buy new tires for his truck and
[19:15] we call his truck a miracle truck I'm in
[19:18] that truck you know it's a it's a 1997
[19:21] truck and he still tries to run it and
[19:24] everything I mean he has no money to buy
[19:26] something else so he tries to do with
[19:28] what he's got you know in his ministry
[19:31] well on the 31st of December I was
[19:35] ministering at his church and that was
[19:37] the day that it was the moment my wife
[19:40] and my and my anniversary after we I
[19:43] ministered at his church that night he
[19:47] went to take some brethren back to their
[19:49] home and before he left he checked the
[19:52] oil his oil light came on on his truck
[19:55] he wanted me to tell you all this
[19:57] because this was for the glory of God he
[20:01] his oil light came on in his truck and
[20:03] he and he looked at the at the oil stick
[20:06] and and there was no oil whatsoever in
[20:09] in the in the car nothing at all I mean
[20:12] he said he says I know there was nothing
[20:14] and so the brother that was there I
[20:16] still stayed back at the church me and
[20:18] my wife and my family we stayed back at
[20:20] the church with everybody else he said
[20:22] let me take these brethren home and the
[20:23] brother that was with him he said let's
[20:25] just drive up to my house I got about a
[20:27] quart of oil there in my house that you
[20:30] can put in there that may be enough for
[20:33] to take you back home and the drive from
[20:35] his church to his house it's about an
[20:38] hour drive so he said ok so they they
[20:43] went and they put the oil in
[20:45] and though he went back to pick us up
[20:47] from from the church from the brothers
[20:50] sister's house that we were waiting for
[20:52] him out so he told me he said but least
[20:54] listen my old light came on there was no
[20:57] oil in there but I thank God you know
[20:58] that that that the brother had a quart
[21:00] of oil he said that might be enough
[21:02] we're not sure he said but why don't we
[21:04] just pray let's just talk let's just
[21:06] pray and say Lord refills so we prayed
[21:09] then we asked the Lord he said we said
[21:11] Lord even if you if you have to just
[21:13] fill this car up with new oil if you
[21:15] have to right so we got home and we got
[21:18] home that night and and he did the
[21:21] little surprise party for us because he
[21:23] wanted to rush because they had that
[21:25] they had that going for us as well and
[21:27] Bella was all in it and she didn't even
[21:29] tell us and everything so anyways so the
[21:33] next days when we had to leave to go
[21:36] back to Nicaragua and brother Eric said
[21:39] that on this that was the first but then
[21:41] on the second he he needed to leave back
[21:44] again use the truck but before he went
[21:46] wherever he needed to go he said I'm
[21:48] gonna stop by the mechanic first about
[21:51] this oil thing to see where the oil is
[21:53] leaking so he went before he does that
[21:56] he always has to fill his radiator with
[21:58] water before he leaves because he's
[22:00] always constantly having problems with
[22:02] his radiator so he filled it up with
[22:05] water and he checked the oil he checked
[22:06] the oil stick and he said he said
[22:11] brother Luis God is my witness that oil
[22:13] stick was filled to where the top was
[22:16] that he said he said I don't I know the
[22:19] brother only had just a little bit of
[22:20] oil that he put in there so he said well
[22:23] let me do this I'm still gonna take it
[22:24] to the mechanic the mechanic looked at
[22:26] it he said he said sir
[22:28] he said that car is full of oil and
[22:30] there is no leak anywhere whatsoever and
[22:32] he said maybe that maybe it was an
[22:35] electricity problem you know the oil
[22:37] light came on and there was electricity
[22:39] pong gaming he took it to the
[22:41] electrician there and he looked at it
[22:43] and he said listen if the oil light came
[22:46] on in that truck you know that means
[22:48] there was no oil in the car and he said
[22:51] brother Luis God answered our prayer
[22:53] that night he filled that car up with
[22:55] all and I don't even know we only put
[22:57] just a little
[22:58] and tiny bit in there and so he wanted
[23:02] to let the church know that because you
[23:05] know he thought it was outstanding he
[23:07] said my goodness I know I know him I
[23:09] know he's still the same yesterday today
[23:11] he cares about our bodies just as much
[23:13] as he cares about anything you know that
[23:15] you need to use for his glory amen
[23:17] and that's not the only first time I've
[23:19] seen you know God working mechanically
[23:22] on a car you know he can do it so I just
[23:25] wanted he just wanted me to tell that
[23:26] for his glory amen
[23:27] and also he wanted me to mention that
[23:30] that a lot of the people of when you saw
[23:32] some of the pictures there there's
[23:34] people around his community that are new
[23:36] people that are coming into the church
[23:38] from just around town or he's got a lady
[23:40] that wants to be baptized and then
[23:42] somebody else that came to the Lord so
[23:45] after we we had left so who knows we you
[23:47] know we just plant the seed and then the
[23:49] Lord takes care of the rest amen praise
[23:51] God so we just thank him for that
[23:53] amen so we're gonna have brother Wade

[27:02] organism has to work together and that's
[27:03] what we did we or we were an organism we

[27:10] works when everybody works together it
[27:12] works out great so food was good
[27:16] preaching was good fellowship was good
[27:19] I'm getting to that
[27:23] next turning looking a brother I got
[27:28] that right here on my nose
[27:30] turn around looking a brother and thank
[27:32] the brother especially our young people
[27:36] for helping putting stuff up taking
[27:39] stuff down it was a group effort on
[27:45] organism so now there's anything else

[27:54] babies while the mothers did some work
[27:57] and give their minds and the food was
[28:03] outstanding I mean it was like real good
[28:10] and may I help clean up and it just
[28:13] worked out really well amen so for those
[28:17] of you that weren't here yesterday you
[28:20] missed a good fellowship meal so and I
[28:23] know we can't beard everyone these are
[28:25] not required functions but it is good to
[28:29] get with brothers and sisters I've like
[28:31] precious faith so if you got your Bibles
[28:33] let's turn to revelations but we're
[28:34] gonna start revelation 6:1 I'm gonna
[28:38] read through some of the seals and also
[28:40] some of you got this book most of us all
[28:43] did now the purpose of this book is it
[28:46] is a study book done by a good brother
[28:49] of ours a brother Trevor Edmund he's
[28:52] from Jeffersonville and he's been here a
[28:55] few times before but he compiled this
[28:58] book brother Dale looked over it and I
[29:01] look through it and it it's with brother
[29:04] Dale doing this the church ages starting
[29:06] into the church ages if he ever gets in
[29:08] them starting in the churches it's a
[29:13] study for every church age so take it
[29:15] home get with your wife get with your
[29:17] children and study brother jokes that
[29:19] he's still got a few people maybe
[29:21] they're not here but if you're if you're
[29:22] here and you got one you need to see
[29:24] brother Joe so you can so he can give
[29:26] them to you and you can start in them
[29:28] but it's really it's done extremely well
[29:31] and very professional so it's a good
[29:35] study guide go
[29:36] home listen to the seals and take the
[29:39] little test in here it's good to to help
[29:42] the jog the old memory so on think
[29:45] brother Joe Canada for bringing that to
[29:47] our attention all of our Oliver I was
[29:50] thinking yesterday all of our young guys
[29:51] they're so sharp and and all of us are
[29:54] getting so dull till we need the sharp
[29:57] ones I mean listen listen to me you can
[30:03] have dull knives in a drawer but you
[30:07] gotta have some sharp ones don't abs are
[30:10] for butter and stuff like that sharp
[30:12] knives are for steak so you need them
[30:14] both let's don't throw them let's no
[30:17] let's don't throw the the knives away
[30:20] their little not as sharp as they used
[30:22] to be so but it's good to have young
[30:25] people in here to to look at these
[30:29] things and bring it to our attention and
[30:30] you know get approval and and then do it
[30:33] in the right channel and doing it in the
[30:35] right channel makes everything it's an
[30:36] organism so but I thank them for for
[30:42] doing that for us the younger younger
[30:44] guys being able to find these things for
[30:47] us revelation 6 I'm just going to read
[30:49] through the seals and then we'll get
[30:50] down to number 6 now the sixth seal is
[30:53] going to be we're going to cover the
[30:57] sixth seal and then we're going to cover
[31:01] there is a thing called an interval
[31:04] between the sixth seal and a seventh
[31:06] seal we'll cover that I believe we need
[31:09] to cover it extensively because I think
[31:12] it's very important for us to see what
[31:14] God's done and what he's doing and what
[31:17] he's gonna do but my brother Dale said
[31:19] and it's very true this Bible was
[31:23] compiled you know I was thinking
[31:26] did you catch window what brother Dale
[31:28] was preaching cuz remember Paul and I
[31:30] Paul wrote part of the Bible but
[31:33] Iranians didn't Iranians did not
[31:36] actually listen I don't know that he
[31:38] actually read his church age in the book
[31:42] of Revelation skill John didn't write it
[31:44] till 1896
[31:45] you see what I'm saying what I'm saying
[31:47] is Irina's didn't stand up and say now
[31:49] God told us with
[31:50] his way we're supposed to add no they
[31:53] acted that way because God knew they
[31:54] were gonna act that way and he put it in
[31:56] the Bible for John to write and for us
[31:59] to reflect on you know I'm saying
[32:01] Irina's didn't turn over to the Book of
[32:03] Revelations there was no Book of
[32:04] Revelations when I rainiest was was
[32:07] preaching and when the people of of the
[32:09] second Church age the Smyrna church age
[32:12] when they come to be this wasn't written
[32:15] in a book somewhere for them to read it
[32:16] but they did live it out just exactly
[32:19] though what God saw because why he was
[32:23] in the midst of the seven golden
[32:24] candlesticks with his quality in each
[32:28] church age at different different
[32:31] qualities God's got a variety he used
[32:34] all those like we were talking about
[32:36] this morning God uses fingers toes hands
[32:39] feet everything is all important we're
[32:41] all important in the body of Christ
[32:43] everybody is important so let's bow our
[32:46] heads and we get started on the sixth
[32:49] seal the Lord Jesus thank you for this
[32:52] day Lord we pray that you'd just be with
[32:54] us now you'd be the one that does the
[32:56] speaking Lord you'd be the one that does
[32:59] the revealing because without you Lord
[33:01] we're nothing you have sent us the

[35:27] Airport no thanks to her are it's okay
[35:35] if your face would be red and be ready
[35:37] Melanie and I saw when the lamb opened
[35:40] one of the seals and I heard as it were
[35:43] the noise of thunder one of the four
[35:44] beasts saying come and see
[35:45] I saw him behold a white horse and he
[35:48] that selling him had a bow and a crown
[35:49] was given unto him and he went forth
[35:50] conquering and to conquer him when he
[35:53] had opened the second seal I heard the
[35:54] second beast say come and see and they
[35:56] went out another horse that was red and
[35:58] power was given him that sat thereon to
[36:00] take peace from the earth that they
[36:02] should kill one another and there was
[36:03] given unto him a great sword the reason
[36:05] I'm reading this I want to bring it back
[36:06] to your memory because you know what
[36:08] subliminally subliminally inside your
[36:11] brain you are thinking about what's been
[36:13] preached before whether you are thinking
[36:16] there's no way you can think it through
[36:18] fast but each seal comes up and you're
[36:19] like okay that's justification okay
[36:21] that's sanctification okay that's the
[36:23] Holy Ghost okay and I heard him when he
[36:26] had opened the third seal I heard the
[36:27] third beast say come and see I'll be
[36:29] held in a little black horse and him to
[36:31] set on he that sat on him had a pair of
[36:33] balances in his name I heard a voice in
[36:36] the midst of the four beasts say a
[36:37] measure of wheat for penny three
[36:39] measures of barley for a penny see thou
[36:41] hurt not the oil and the wine the Holy
[36:44] Ghost in the stimulation and when he had
[36:47] opened the fourth seal I heard the voice
[36:48] of the fourth beast they come and see I
[36:50] look to behold a pale horse in his name
[36:52] that sat on him was death and hell
[36:53] followed with him and power was given
[36:56] unto them over the fourth part of the
[36:57] earth to kill with the sword and with
[36:59] hunger and with death and with the
[37:00] beasts of the earth and when he had
[37:02] opened the fifth seal this is when we
[37:03] just got finished with I saw under the
[37:05] altar the souls immediately you know
[37:07] we're in another dimension now because
[37:09] there's no other Beast the Beast powers
[37:12] are gone and they're not here anymore on
[37:15] this fifth seal all right I saw under
[37:17] the altar the souls of them that were
[37:19] slain for the word of God and for the
[37:20] testimony which they held and they cried
[37:24] with a loud voice saying how long O Lord
[37:25] holy and true dost thou not judge and
[37:27] avenge our blood on them that dwell on
[37:29] the earth and white robes were given
[37:31] under every one of them and it was said
[37:33] unto them that they should rest yet for
[37:34] a little season until their
[37:37] fellow-servants also and their brethren
[37:38] that should be killed as they were now
[37:40] see that's gonna tie in with this next
[37:42] seal coming up should be fulfilled and I
[37:45] beheld now watch because watch what John
[37:52] says I saw when the lamb opened one of
[37:57] the seals number one and when he had
[38:00] opened the second seal and when I'm
[38:02] reading here in verse five and when he
[38:04] had opened the third seal and when he
[38:06] had opened the fourth seal and when he
[38:08] had opened the fifth seal now john
[38:10] changes his wording he changes his
[38:14] wording on this seal he says I beheld
[38:17] when he opened the sixth seal he's
[38:23] bringing it down to right here and I
[38:26] beheld when he had opened the sixth seal
[38:29] and lo there was a great earthquake
[38:31] why because what happened John watch
[38:35] what I'm saying John saw people persons
[38:39] the first seal whether it was a whoever
[38:42] he saw he saw a man sitting on a horse
[38:45] right second seal he saw a man sitting
[38:48] on a horse third seal he saw a man
[38:50] sitting on the horse fourth seal he saw
[38:52] a man sitting on a horse fifth seal he
[38:55] sees people souls under the altar here
[38:59] he doesn't he goes into nature all right
[39:06] everybody see that same man and when he
[39:09] had opened the sixth seal and lo there
[39:11] was a great earthquake and the Sun
[39:14] became black as sackcloth of hair and
[39:17] the moon became as blood no people
[39:21] happenings events nature all right there
[39:25] be ok with that and the stars of heaven
[39:28] fell unto the earth even as a fig tree
[39:30] casteth her untimely figs when she is
[39:32] shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven
[39:35] departed as a scroll this was a long
[39:37] long one but we got a cover and the
[39:40] heaven departed as a scroll when it was
[39:41] rolled together and every mountain and
[39:42] Island were moved out of their places
[39:44] now he comes he's not talking to the
[39:48] bride and he's talking about people that
[39:50] are now on the earth during this song he
[39:53] sees this first and then he comes up and
[39:56] here pops up and the kings of the earth
[39:58] and the great men and the rich men and
[40:03] the chief captains and the mighty men
[40:05] now that's all people that are left on
[40:10] the earth that's not the bride we
[40:12] already gone upon a for sale all right
[40:14] so we're not hearing the fit the fifth
[40:16] seals not the bride this sixth seal
[40:19] isn't that's not the bride the men and
[40:21] the chief captains and the mighty men
[40:23] and every bondman and every free man hid
[40:26] themselves in the dens and in the rocks
[40:27] of the mountains and said to the
[40:29] mountains and rocks fall on us and hide
[40:31] us from the face of him that sitteth on
[40:32] the throne and from the wrath of the
[40:34] lamb for the great day of his wrath has
[40:36] come and who shall be able to stand a
[40:41] man you may be seated in the Lord that
[40:43] is blessing to the reason we're
[40:44] who shall be able to stand well that's
[40:52] not us that's not even the fifth seal
[40:55] gee that's not the 144,000 that's the
[41:01] Kings and natural men of the earth that
[41:03] alright say ma'am
[41:04] alright that's the natural kings of the
[41:07] earth
[41:08] so let's dis seal in it
[41:15] thanks sir
[41:16] thank you for the day this seal starts
[41:20] out with John looking at nature John
[41:28] looking at something that's going on on
[41:30] the earth after the rapture amen
[41:37] after the church is gone the the fifth
[41:40] seal Jew is not standing there literally
[41:42] right the man fifth seal Jews not there
[41:45] in that he's looking actually in this
[41:47] dimension that we're talking about this
[41:50] is Adam it this is our dimension he's
[41:52] back on the earth he's talking about
[41:55] earthquakes happening right here on the
[41:59] earth thereby alright with that cuz
[42:02] that's where you stick we got to bring
[42:03] this six Elam as being something that
[42:10] happens to nature something that happens
[42:14] to a natural world we've been talking
[42:17] now the first seal sure it had a natural
[42:20] meaning but it also had a spiritual
[42:21] meaning too because it was to purr
[42:23] there's always two powers God's power
[42:25] and Satan's power when you see a horse
[42:27] rider when you see a man get on a horse
[42:29] and ride through the first future
[42:31] changes as we were discussing a long
[42:33] time ago
[42:34] over a year ago now when we started we
[42:37] saw that that was a power in opposition
[42:39] to what had already been there because
[42:42] remember God is the originator Satan is
[42:45] not the originator of anything he's a
[42:48] pervert er of what's already original so
[42:52] they were men on the earth in the first
[42:53] church age preaching the truth of the
[42:56] gospel
[42:57] then satan comes in and perverts what
[43:01] God's already doing all right so that
[43:03] was your seals that we were talking
[43:05] about the seal one through three is the
[43:11] first two three they okay with that we
[43:18] know where we're at we've been we've
[43:20] been here we don't want to background
[43:21] too much but this is church age one two
[43:23] three is showing the first seal second
[43:26] seal is the fourth church age which is
[43:28] the red horse black horse was during
[43:31] Martin Luther and John Wesley and the
[43:33] fourth seal has to be in this age
[43:36] because we take a rapture after the
[43:38] fourth seal so the fourth seal happens I
[43:40] mean the rapture happens on the fourth
[43:42] seal so we go up so this is all bride I
[43:45] mean the bride just vacates the building
[43:48] we're going we're not even in this
[43:50] dimension
[43:51] all right then you bring a fifth seal
[43:53] Jew which is in another dimension they
[43:57] were in this dimension but they were
[43:58] killed so they're in another dimension
[44:00] that John looks in that dimension but as
[44:04] I told you before maybe maybe we got it
[44:06] maybe within maybe want to go back over
[44:08] to him but when you come to these first
[44:11] four we look at these first four seals
[44:16] and I want you to see this
[44:19] we have actively been involved without
[44:22] those seals actively been involved which
[44:27] is justification sanctification baptism
[44:29] the Holy Ghost in the word main manifest
[44:31] or we can look back through the book
[44:33] through what brother Dale is gonna start
[44:35] on the church Agence we can look in the
[44:38] church age book and brother Branham
[44:39] gives us the history of every one of the
[44:41] church ages and what happens all the way
[44:43] up to here so we have been actively
[44:46] participating in all these because this
[44:49] is your Redemption this is your this is
[44:51] the bride's this is our revival right
[44:55] here we're in our own but this was the
[44:57] revival coming out of what Calvary where
[45:00] Christ divorced the Jews divorced Israel
[45:04] in the Old Testament and married a
[45:07] Gentile bride I was thinking today do
[45:10] you know
[45:11] you cannot have a bride without a groom
[45:17] because you say I'm the bride of if
[45:23] there's no groom you can't say you're a
[45:25] bride know you may be betrothed and you
[45:27] may be going with somebody what we call
[45:29] used to call going steady
[45:31] you know we swap numbers phone numbers
[45:35] back then you know that was us going
[45:36] steady or going out or going with
[45:39] somebody but when June and I were
[45:43] setting a marriage date she then became
[45:46] what potentially she became my bride but
[45:48] now live she can't be a bride without a
[45:51] groom but a groom can't be a groom
[45:55] without a bride think of that God is not
[46:01] complete without me and you God he
[46:05] didn't just have to have a bride he
[46:07] wanted the bride and you know what he
[46:10] didn't want a divorce Israel but let's I
[46:12] was telling us in school downstairs this
[46:15] morning during Moses his life we see the
[46:21] commentary of Moses goes obviously after
[46:24] the fact but God you ever step in make
[46:29] every time he'd fall every time he'd get
[46:31] up every time he do good every time you
[46:33] do bad God saw every bit of it but Moses
[46:36] didn't Moses had to live through what
[46:39] God had already saw you and I have to
[46:42] live through these church ages and thank
[46:44] God for a prophet that went back and
[46:47] told us every Church age what happened
[46:50] connecting it to a city connecting it to
[46:52] a star because remember when brother
[46:55] Dale got to those seven stars your 7
[46:58] stars are the 7 messengers and we put a
[47:02] lot on the messenger it's the message
[47:05] it's the message behind the messenger
[47:09] and then it's the message that God is
[47:12] using that conduit of arrhenius Martin
[47:15] Columbo Paul Luther Wesley and brother
[47:17] Brown of a conduit to use so that you
[47:21] are not
[47:24] what did I say last Sunday who's gonna
[47:27] take a rapture who's gonna take a body
[47:31] change so it's personal you're not gonna
[47:35] take a body change because brother Dale
[47:37] does you're gonna take a body change
[47:42] because you come to a place that you say
[47:46] I and my father are one
[47:51] amen
[47:53] that makes it real personal Jesus walked
[47:56] up one day and he didn't he didn't say
[47:58] now if you'll say thus saith the Lord
[48:00] that mountain of move Jesus never said
[48:03] thus saith the Lord
[48:05] he was the Lord so now you and I have to
[48:09] live in the age of thus saith the Lord
[48:11] brother Brent said the brothers have
[48:12] thus saith the Lord or she'd be still
[48:14] that didn't say he didn't say she'd have
[48:16] thus saith the Lord that was it because
[48:20] brother Branham said when you begin to
[48:22] say I and my father are one
[48:24] and these other things the show could
[48:26] pull away see a lot of people cannot
[48:27] swallow that your God without having to
[48:33] go through brother Branham ain't it the
[48:43] truth like brother Forney was talking
[48:47] yesterday appreciate yesterday it's
[48:50] Jesus Christ is who we gotta help he
[48:53] breathing room can change your body
[48:55] brother Dale can change your body but if
[48:57] you say I am is gonna change your body
[49:00] and you say ok there's going to change
[49:02] your body that's why I said we're we're
[49:10] a lot Tunis
[49:15] it's either God knows and then like
[49:20] somebody said oh brother and he said
[49:21] then it's got God brother branham on us
[49:23] that makes us a Trinity again and not
[49:26] you know listen and I think we say it
[49:29] kind of hard here because of all the but
[49:31] brother Forney said it last night he
[49:33] it's william branham cannot change your
[49:36] body
[49:37] he brought us a word that we can look to
[49:40] and clear back all the stuff because
[49:43] even we were talking about this morning
[49:44] brother Lewis mentioned the quote broke
[49:49] where we're gonna take a body change
[49:55] folks it's gonna be Jesus Christ is
[49:57] gonna change our body no one has come to
[50:00] immortality except that one man no one
[50:05] so him in you will bring the body change
[50:11] amen and it's trusting in the word
[50:14] that's already been wrote when Jesus
[50:21] said it was finished at Calvary he
[50:22] needed nothing else brother Branham said
[50:25] if he Jesus Christ were to come and
[50:28] stand right here tonight in a
[50:29] three-piece suit
[50:30] he cannot heal you or save you all he
[50:34] could say is I've already done it that's
[50:38] all he could say I've already done it
[50:41] so when we come to these seals you say
[50:44] while they open up the clothes the big
[50:46] debate well if you don't believe them
[50:49] they're closed if you believe them and
[50:53] live them they're open amen
[50:58] and what a great thing that a prophet
[51:01] brought us all these messages and we
[51:05] were able to collect them in tape and
[51:08] book form and able to know that he's not
[51:13] talking about himself he's talking about
[51:16] Jesus Christ amen
[51:19] he's talking about it does us no good to
[51:21] realize brother Branham was at the
[51:25] headstone doesn't make you no big thing
[51:29] if you realize brother they'll come to
[51:31] headstone you got to put yourself in the
[51:35] picture what are we doing we're
[51:36] diverting our our faith to if it's like
[51:41] I told brother Homer likes now listen
[51:42] sit down and think for a little while
[51:44] we're all a bunch of Catholics
[51:49] where the Browns gonna come back save us
[51:51] all well no he's not he ain't say nobody
[51:58] welcomes this place we go he's gonna
[52:03] take a rapture who's gonna take a body
[52:05] change all right well then it's God in
[52:08] you it says in the Bible Christ in you
[52:11] the hope of glory and to me Christ is
[52:15] the seals because what is this this is
[52:17] the plan of redemption all right so
[52:21] we've become intimate with these first
[52:23] four seals because that is if you're
[52:25] born again today and you're breathing if
[52:29] you're born again in your breathing your
[52:33] your your your going higher in God okay
[52:37] I said if you're born again and
[52:39] breathing in that order you can be
[52:42] breathing and not born again but if
[52:46] you're breathing and born again and you
[52:47] come and sit under the spout that you've
[52:50] been given something's got to happen
[52:53] something there has got to be a growth
[52:56] or you just don't have it something's
[52:58] got to be inside you going I need some
[53:01] more of that I need some more of that
[53:03] see I need some more you say well the
[53:05] fourth seal we take a rapture what else
[53:06] do we need we got to understand how this
[53:09] guy gets changed because up here when we
[53:13] look at this seal one through four what
[53:19] who was it somebody oh somebody said
[53:20] you're gonna hate me for this but people
[53:24] have been born again never heard of
[53:25] William Branham even been born again as
[53:27] never heard of the seals but people have
[53:30] never been born again and not heard of
[53:31] Jesus Christ
[53:32] so let's put that in the bottom line
[53:35] never has a man got born again without
[53:38] knowing Jesus Christ as a personal
[53:40] Savior now then what's he gonna do like
[53:43] brother funny said the Holy Ghost is
[53:44] what's going to turn you and lead you
[53:46] and guide you into all truth all right
[53:49] so you get born again first but our
[53:53] Commission let's think about this our
[53:55] commission today is to take a body
[54:00] change that's our Commission
[54:03] that's our that's my commission and you
[54:06] know do the same thing go to the point
[54:07] like this it's your commission to take a
[54:09] body change but we're waiting on brother
[54:11] Nell to preach and so we camp Jesus has
[54:16] already preached it hey listen Jesus
[54:23] already preached the seals
[54:24] he's already died he's already had a
[54:27] resurrection he's already had
[54:29] glorification a glorified body and he's
[54:31] already ascended somewhere we know where
[54:34] it is but I'm just telling you somewhere
[54:35] right
[54:36] what's he waiting on waiting on Who I am
[54:42] to realize that the I am is not back
[54:46] there and I like what brother again what
[54:48] brother Jason Watkins most people that
[54:51] are in their denomination and this is
[54:52] true you think about when you come up
[54:53] you are getting maybe not born again but
[54:57] saved by historic God Jesus died on the
[55:00] cross two thousand years ago yeah but
[55:04] what about the day of Pentecost when he
[55:05] come back and what about when you were
[55:07] sitting in an old church some wearing
[55:09] some preacher with the Holy Ghost speaks
[55:11] to your heart
[55:12] that's not a dead man talking to you
[55:14] that's a live man talking to you that's
[55:17] live God speaking through a man to you
[55:21] and then that what that bursts you into
[55:24] the body amen
[55:27] but the Bible says being born again so
[55:29] we have to come through these four seals
[55:32] but we have to like I said before we
[55:34] have to laugh them back and put five six
[55:37] and I can I'm gonna put seven over here
[55:39] just for a cuz there's a gap right here
[55:42] a pretty good one too but we'll get into
[55:46] that later on I don't want them I don't
[55:49] want to get into that today but you see
[55:50] that there's a gap you read six seals
[55:54] there's a gap you reach six trumpets
[55:56] there's a gap you read all these
[55:58] different ones after six there's a gap
[55:59] even brother Branham preached six seals
[56:01] and what do you do he stopped and had
[56:04] questions and answers and then he
[56:05] preached the seventh seal always a gap
[56:07] somewhere in there there's a gap between
[56:08] six and seven all right so and we'll
[56:11] discuss that because I believe I under
[56:13] kind of understand what's going on with
[56:14] that but seal number five was
[56:16] what it's not just justification in a
[56:19] baby form it's a justified
[56:20] group of people that never sinned and
[56:24] you gotta realize that you don't just
[56:29] it's been here say for so many years
[56:35] oh we're coming to something oh we're
[56:40] coming to something
[56:41] [Music]
[56:44] well is he I am coming to something and
[56:47] I am as an ever-present and even at the
[56:51] burning bush God got Moses his attention
[56:55] with the bush burning but when he said I
[56:59] said who are you he said he didn't say
[57:01] just say I am he said I am that I am
[57:06] he's saying I'm that one that you've
[57:10] been looking for I am that I am not that
[57:14] I am that I am he's not double saying
[57:17] itself he's telling him I am that I am
[57:20] that I am what Jesus when he come on
[57:23] earth he said I'm what I'm the sheep for
[57:28] I'm the sheet I'm the shepherd I'm the
[57:30] sheepfold I'm the door
[57:32] I'm the root I'm the offspring he named
[57:35] everything he was you know what he was
[57:37] saying I am that I am
[57:40] I'm that I let me just put it in Georgia
[57:43] language I'm I am and that's what I am I
[57:48] am I am
[57:49] that's I am I am I am that and he was
[57:52] identifying himself who he was now you
[57:56] and I got to do the same thing well yeah
[57:58] we know he would we're kicking it back
[58:05] no that's and I was and yes and I'm
[58:09] gonna be this is an I am this right here
[58:13] is the I am amen so the fifth seal shows
[58:17] us a group of people that were saved or
[58:20] born again not born again but given
[58:22] white robes
[58:23] I guess you stay safe given white robes
[58:25] for nothing they did
[58:29] nothing but because God blinded his own
[58:34] children's eyes at Calvary divorced
[58:38] Israel took a Gentile bride he said I'm
[58:41] gonna save that group of people you know
[58:43] what he done he's done the same thing to
[58:45] you he said to seven church age is the
[58:47] worst Church age there is no like
[58:50] there's no way
[58:53] but now brother Brown said I drew a
[58:55] little light in there why there's got to
[58:57] be a born-again group there's got to be
[58:59] like brother faughn he said where
[59:00] there's light there's blood
[59:02] I like that was good yesterday for the
[59:03] shorter length I mean he pries that was
[59:06] really good but where there's light they
[59:08] had to see to be able to put the blood
[59:11] over the doorpost they had to be able to
[59:12] see where to put the thing they had to
[59:15] be able how many of you tried to cook in
[59:17] the dark I fly brother Warren he said I
[59:19] don't want to eat your food he's that
[59:22] something moving he said you know yeah
[59:24] but if they have lights on it you can
[59:27] see how many of your sisters for the
[59:29] blindfold on and cook you can't do that
[59:31] you cut your finger off for some
[59:33] ingredients and I'm going to get there
[59:34] what do you say Castrol is two
[59:37] casseroles did a vegetable oh well that
[59:40] would be a revelation
[59:41] oh man but that's what it would be but
[59:45] so without light coming and like said
[59:48] without light coming in the end time
[59:50] listen you're born again today
[59:52] you're light you're the light of this
[59:55] church age you're the light of God from
[59:58] the age that you were born in but this
[1:00:00] light is not going to be damned our
[1:00:03] lights not now the world is but our
[1:00:08] lights never going to be dim God's
[1:00:09] lights never dim down oh please come on
[1:00:12] people that would make God become weak
[1:00:15] and then stronger and win oh man his
[1:00:17] light has been when God said let there
[1:00:19] be light that light has never been put
[1:00:21] out of course we know that's not the Sun
[1:00:24] in the moon we know that don't we
[1:00:26] because they were created a little bit
[1:00:27] later than that light was me and you
[1:00:30] because Jesus when he come and said I am
[1:00:33] the light of the world you were in him
[1:00:36] and he said then you're gonna be the
[1:00:39] light you're gonna be the
[1:00:42] to the first church age the second
[1:00:44] church age third fourth fifth sixth
[1:00:46] seventh alright that alright say man you
[1:00:50] are the light of the world
[1:00:52] who's the light of the world good job
[1:00:55] man good class today
[1:00:56] good class today so you know what
[1:01:01] subliminally now that would mean in your
[1:01:04] subconscious mind we know we took a body
[1:01:08] change right here
[1:01:10] but now the force field in it didn't
[1:01:13] explain how but subliminally now we're
[1:01:18] going to look with this the reason I'm
[1:01:20] bringing that word in because in the
[1:01:22] sixth seal now the fifth seal is pretty
[1:01:25] cut-and-dry it shows a group of people
[1:01:27] that was given eternal life that didn't
[1:01:29] want it and that you and me but it also
[1:01:33] it's showing me too and you that God's
[1:01:36] gonna save a group of people regardless
[1:01:38] of anything regardless that brothers
[1:01:40] like brother Forney said yesterday when
[1:01:42] when that when that body change comes
[1:01:45] and when that revelation comes it's
[1:01:48] gonna roll right into a rapture you
[1:01:50] can't stop it Satan can't stop it it's
[1:01:52] gonna roll you right into the wedding
[1:01:54] supper it's gonna roll you right into
[1:01:55] the future home it's gonna roll I mean
[1:01:57] the Millennium roll you right into the
[1:01:59] future you can't miss it
[1:02:01] those who his glory so I said that they
[1:02:03] didn't those who his glory justified
[1:02:06] he's already those who he justified
[1:02:09] right here he's already glorified now
[1:02:13] who's the only person has been glorified
[1:02:15] the seventh seal who's the seventh seal
[1:02:20] Jesus Christ he's standing today in a
[1:02:23] glorified body no one else is or the
[1:02:27] Bible is wrong when it said what only
[1:02:29] one man has reached immortality right
[1:02:34] and that's Jesus Christ he was once a
[1:02:37] mortal and now he's immortal no one else
[1:02:39] is that way I you explained any other
[1:02:41] way you want to about Elijah and all
[1:02:43] these other people I'm going by what the
[1:02:44] Bible says Bible said the only one
[1:02:46] person reached the immortality and
[1:02:48] that's Jesus Christ in other words he
[1:02:49] was immortal now he's in mortal you know
[1:02:52] you could brother Dale was reading
[1:02:53] something this morning but Lazarus could
[1:02:55] step up and say
[1:02:56] oh if you read revelations one in there
[1:02:59] where he says I was dead now I'm alive
[1:03:03] I'm alive forevermore Lazarus could have
[1:03:07] said part of that scripture I was dead
[1:03:10] now I'm alive but he died again
[1:03:14] anybody's been resurrected from the dead
[1:03:16] has died again so they can't say I'm
[1:03:18] dead and alive and alive forevermore
[1:03:22] only one man can say that that's Jesus
[1:03:25] Christ now that's the man we got to get
[1:03:27] here to change your body and then that's
[1:03:32] the man we got to get here no other man
[1:03:34] no other Church a messenger no other
[1:03:36] prophet priest our King has reached this
[1:03:38] except one man and that's Jesus Christ
[1:03:40] and he has already told us how to do it
[1:03:49] we just got to believe it so the fifth
[1:03:53] seal we got finished with it now the
[1:03:55] sixth seal the ones that reason I said
[1:03:57] subliminally because under the sixth
[1:03:59] seal there's going to be some things
[1:04:01] that we're gonna have to touch on like
[1:04:04] brother Branham remember he preached the
[1:04:06] sixth seal Anini says we're gonna preach
[1:04:09] the trumpets remember seven at seven not
[1:04:13] the Feast of the trumpets he preached
[1:04:14] that oh but he was gonna take each
[1:04:16] trumpet one running after the other
[1:04:17] right gonna get the school gonna get all
[1:04:20] these things and do that and then what
[1:04:22] do you do he said I had a hard time with
[1:04:24] that many of you preached the sermon a
[1:04:27] few ministers you-you-you man I mean
[1:04:30] you're like Elijah you want to plow in
[1:04:31] that field right there and you feel like
[1:04:34] you've bumped into that row and here
[1:04:36] you're going all of a sudden you your
[1:04:40] mule ain't moving right right brother
[1:04:44] Bob right by Larenz I'm your brother
[1:04:46] Luis bollo
[1:04:47] oh you brother Larry some of you you
[1:04:49] want to go this way so bad and you bout
[1:04:52] bloody left mules mouth trying to get it
[1:04:55] to chain hang on James why God wants
[1:04:58] something else done so that's why he was
[1:05:01] her brother Bryan brother Brown member
[1:05:02] you got to remember he said I was gonna
[1:05:04] preach him he said I didn't feel right
[1:05:06] something didn't come he kept saying
[1:05:08] something's wrong something
[1:05:09] wrong and then God revealed to him after
[1:05:11] he had already preached the sixth seal
[1:05:14] he said you preached him supernaturally
[1:05:17] under the sixth seal so he was preaching
[1:05:20] two messages in one I asked what he said
[1:05:26] he was preaching the trumpets under the
[1:05:30] sixth seal now then he comes in priest
[1:05:31] to feast of the trumpets that's a little
[1:05:33] bit different because that's the Feast
[1:05:34] of the trumpets besides one two three
[1:05:36] four five six seven and even if you'll
[1:05:38] read in your Bible trumpet one through
[1:05:40] six there's an interval then the seventh
[1:05:43] trumpet alright so you see there's an
[1:05:45] interval to that too so subliminally or
[1:05:48] supernaturally ever how you want to
[1:05:49] pronounce that there is something going
[1:05:51] on on every one of these seals and we
[1:05:53] know what that is that's the thunder
[1:05:55] that's the voice of God speaking to you
[1:05:57] I sent up here and I can give you a
[1:05:59] dissertation for hours hours we've been
[1:06:03] at it a year February is when I started
[1:06:06] last year on the seals we've been a year
[1:06:09] we're just on number six I mean we're
[1:06:11] well we're starting on number six but
[1:06:13] you see how this word of God is eternal
[1:06:17] but you cover what you can but you would
[1:06:20] the Holy Ghost has got you have got to
[1:06:23] fill in the gap you fill in the love
[1:06:26] letter because you know what it's not a
[1:06:28] love letter to me it's a love letter to
[1:06:29] the I am hey that's pretty good from the
[1:06:35] I am to the I am you know what I don't
[1:06:39] hear say here say is when you go from
[1:06:42] one person to another individual but
[1:06:44] when that same person speaking to you
[1:06:48] that all right damn it
[1:06:51] all right so that's how we're gonna set
[1:06:55] this sixth seal up we're going to go
[1:06:56] through the natural part of the seal
[1:06:58] just for a minute we're gonna close in
[1:06:59] just few minutes I don't have you look
[1:07:01] on your paper you don't have a bunch to
[1:07:02] read but we've come to the fifth seal
[1:07:05] where we see purely justification grace
[1:07:11] that's the Great Seal of the Bible
[1:07:13] brother Brown said now we've come to a
[1:07:16] sixth seal which we're going to read in
[1:07:18] a minute brother Brown says that's the
[1:07:19] tribulation seal of the Bible okay so
[1:07:22] we're going to take
[1:07:23] the natural part of the tribulation I
[1:07:25] know we're not going to be in it but we
[1:07:27] need to understand a few things because
[1:07:28] you know what your tribulation is now
[1:07:33] it's not your tribulation that will pray
[1:07:37] for me then yeah
[1:07:40] pray for Thank You Louise pray for me
[1:07:44] Lisa's wife's been gone for a week he
[1:07:47] said some tribulation I'll guarantee you
[1:07:50] keep up with two girls I was just glad
[1:07:54] to handle the same shoe I mean you know
[1:07:56] I just make sure one of them one black
[1:07:57] one went red
[1:07:58] Zoe's is right out there in the hallway
[1:08:00] so let me break in here just a minute we
[1:08:06] need to pray for brother homeland Laura
[1:08:07] he's struggling he's having a hard time
[1:08:12] hard time he was telling June he said
[1:08:17] when we got when sister Margie and her
[1:08:19] brother of home I mean brother jewel was
[1:08:21] talking about coming her coming back you
[1:08:23] know a glorified condition coming back
[1:08:25] you know what happened when brother
[1:08:27] branham go when he went across the
[1:08:28] curtain of time he said his first wife
[1:08:30] came and said to my precious brother and
[1:08:31] hugged his neck he said it's Marge you
[1:08:33] did that to me I'd stop her and go no no
[1:08:35] no you're mine you're mine he misses
[1:08:42] that woman I'm telling you he misses her
[1:08:44] bad so let's we need to pray for him
[1:08:46] what's the to or one they meant the tour
[1:08:48] one he just had he's he's struggling
[1:08:50] he's he's okay but you know what he was
[1:08:53] married for another sixty years and now
[1:08:55] she's not there so let's pray for him
[1:08:57] we're still humans we got human things
[1:09:00] we have to deal with you don't know why
[1:09:02] God took her but you know what I don't
[1:09:04] question it he doesn't either he doesn't
[1:09:05] question God he questions itself a lot
[1:09:08] but he doesn't question God all right so
[1:09:10] let's read right here just a few minutes
[1:09:11] and then we'll be done now the sixth
[1:09:12] seal is the tribulation seal so we are
[1:09:16] gonna have to go through a tribulation
[1:09:18] before we get a body change not a
[1:09:22] natural tribulation not a
[1:09:24] three-and-a-half-year tribulation but
[1:09:28] you're gonna have to go through hell on
[1:09:29] earth though this has never happened
[1:09:32] look at Jesus Christ he didn't have it
[1:09:34] wasn't easy for that man either
[1:09:36] the devil still beat on him right up to
[1:09:40] Calvary brother Brahim said that death
[1:09:44] whatever was buzzer or something was
[1:09:46] buzzing around you know buzzing buzzing
[1:09:48] but right at death
[1:09:50] theythey says I got you now well he just
[1:09:53] didn't know he what he got same way with
[1:09:56] me and you he thinks he can do that to
[1:09:58] me and you but when once we come to
[1:10:00] where we're sealed in I was thinking
[1:10:03] about Rodell so my job this is why I
[1:10:07] look at it you and I are all earthly
[1:10:11] human people that have human jobs we
[1:10:14] have human families we have human
[1:10:16] thoughts in our mind we're just human
[1:10:19] all right but there is I love that song
[1:10:24] the lily of the valley cuz I love the
[1:10:27] phrase that says there's a wall of fire
[1:10:30] around you you have nothing to fear what
[1:10:36] did he lie shisei tuga haze' go hazel
[1:10:40] there's more for us than they are for
[1:10:44] them and go hazel with no revelation he
[1:10:48] goes one to ten thousand one to ten
[1:10:55] thousand Elijah said God open his eyes
[1:11:03] open his eyes and it wasn't that they
[1:11:06] came they were already there cuz he
[1:11:11] lasha by revelation was already seeing
[1:11:14] him if not he will ki couldn't said when
[1:11:16] he said he said open my servants eyes
[1:11:18] and then when he opened his eyes what do
[1:11:19] you see
[1:11:20] he saw ring of fire angels around that
[1:11:26] servant well that's the same way with me
[1:11:27] and you when we move God moves with us
[1:11:31] there's a wall of fire all he done with
[1:11:33] job was as he left them he let the flame
[1:11:36] down just a little bit and let Satan do
[1:11:38] what he wanted to do with his life
[1:11:39] couldn't kill him though God listen God
[1:11:43] the only one who can kill you only one
[1:11:46] now you can die death but God's only one
[1:11:49] can allow it
[1:11:50] let's get you a Christian but I just
[1:11:52] think of a wall of fire and then as you
[1:11:54] walk that fire just stays with you
[1:11:57] that's your guardian angel that's your
[1:11:59] protection is that fire around you
[1:12:02] because what fires the most it's the
[1:12:04] most thing it's a pure fire what fire is
[1:12:08] so there's a wall of fire around me
[1:12:10] there's nothing now to fear he's the
[1:12:14] lily of the valley and he's right there
[1:12:17] with you all the time
[1:12:18] amen 50 let's read this let's read these
[1:12:22] quotes and then we'll finish I was just
[1:12:25] gonna try to get the sixth seal what the
[1:12:26] sixth seal is gonna do is it's going to
[1:12:28] show something is going to happen in
[1:12:31] nature that's never happened before now
[1:12:35] listen there was one time that God
[1:12:37] destroyed the world by nature by water
[1:12:40] but that wasn't nature as far as nature
[1:12:44] being the animals and all the you
[1:12:46] understand what I mean he destroyed it
[1:12:48] by water man this is not just water did
[1:12:52] you all read that with me as everything
[1:12:54] else it's I'll get the right piece of
[1:12:59] paper what to do with it what is it it's
[1:13:02] earthquake son becoming black moon
[1:13:07] becoming blood stars falling to the
[1:13:10] earth amen heavens departing as a scroll
[1:13:16] that's never happened before every
[1:13:18] mountain and Island were moved out of
[1:13:19] their place a total brother Brown says
[1:13:24] disruption of nature 50 and I notice
[1:13:26] here when we come to this fifth seal now
[1:13:28] there's no writer goes for it there's no
[1:13:31] beast to announce that John just the
[1:13:33] lamb open it and John saw it there was
[1:13:35] no one there to say now look come and
[1:13:37] see I just told you that
[1:13:39] notice no power of the living creature
[1:13:41] are there on the sixth seal there's no
[1:13:44] beasts to announce it either in other
[1:13:45] words and on the seventh seal there's no
[1:13:47] beasts to announce it no power to
[1:13:49] announce that no one does look after the
[1:13:52] fourth seal there's no announcement of
[1:13:54] any beast power from the six six six
[1:13:57] fifty six or seven not at all all right
[1:14:01] why because
[1:14:03] this is my revelation we know one
[1:14:05] thing's for sure the we go up on the
[1:14:07] fourth seal and those four combat beasts
[1:14:10] is the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is
[1:14:12] inside of you but the fifth sixth and
[1:14:14] seventh seal is personal more personal
[1:14:17] than just a new birth
[1:14:19] you see how personal can you be you got
[1:14:22] to become God you got to become Jesus
[1:14:24] Christ you are Jesus Christ in your soul
[1:14:27] but you need he was Jesus Christ body
[1:14:29] spirit and soul so why can't you have
[1:14:34] the Holy Ghost in your spirit I just a
[1:14:40] question just question yeah I'm just
[1:14:42] asking questions here
[1:14:43] just throwing something out there
[1:14:44] throwing a nugget out let you think
[1:14:46] about because we don't cover I mean
[1:14:48] really
[1:14:50] Jesus's Spirit was the Holy Spirit he
[1:14:56] had no carnal mind and I thought he said
[1:15:00] he came to do away with your carnal mind
[1:15:05] see is this as this thing builds I'm
[1:15:08] telling you this thing builds you gonna
[1:15:09] gain you've got to be able to gain more
[1:15:11] confidence in what God's already said
[1:15:14] not what he's gonna say
[1:15:16] not that there's coming angels around us
[1:15:19] not that there's coming a wall of fire
[1:15:21] when we need it no there's a wall of
[1:15:23] fire around you all the time they meant
[1:15:27] when Adam and Eve walked through the
[1:15:29] Garden of Eden brother Branham said they
[1:15:30] had a Holy Ghost Baylon and that kept
[1:15:36] them away because they had no carnal
[1:15:37] mind they weren't born babies they
[1:15:40] weren't born by sex they were created
[1:15:42] hello
[1:15:43] ain't no what we going back to because
[1:15:48] when God changes this body it's not
[1:15:49] gonna be what come out of mom and daddy
[1:15:50] anymore we'll have a body the Bible says
[1:15:55] like unto his glorious body will be
[1:15:59] changed in the atoms that all right six
[1:16:02] seal number two I'm sorry number two
[1:16:08] we got guys training in the back and
[1:16:11] that's great
[1:16:12] I appreciate joing them and they're able
[1:16:14] to sit out here brother
[1:16:16] Anderson brother Joe was able to sit out
[1:16:18] here and enjoy the service now brother
[1:16:20] Bob he's a different story anyway well
[1:16:33] I'm not telling anyway bob was in the
[1:16:35] back and I watched the service the other
[1:16:38] day of mine and I was a little more
[1:16:40] adamant and moving around a little bit
[1:16:42] well I didn't know who was running the
[1:16:44] camera but it would be on this quote and
[1:16:48] I'd be over here writing something about
[1:16:51] the time I got finished right here he'd
[1:16:54] switch over there and I'd be over here
[1:16:56] and then I you'd hear my voice and I
[1:16:59] wouldn't be anywhere I said Bob he said
[1:17:03] bro wait I was so caught up in what you
[1:17:05] were saying he said I forgot what I was
[1:17:07] doing which is fine that's okay but
[1:17:14] there's people watching that might want
[1:17:16] to see something so I told him I said we
[1:17:20] need to get out no I'm not gonna I did I
[1:17:23] made a horrible statement I said well I
[1:17:25] don't know we might get him saved I said
[1:17:26] we need to find a Center off the street
[1:17:28] let him come in here run the camera
[1:17:29] he might get saved you might want to do
[1:17:31] that but the kids do a real good job not
[1:17:34] that they don't pay attention but their
[1:17:36] mind is sharper than some of ours but I
[1:17:41] watched that thing and I'm like who did
[1:17:44] I thought Bob see brother wait I was
[1:17:47] just froze ionise and then I'd realize
[1:17:49] I'd having to run the camera in he'd get
[1:17:55] by the hand Bob's come a long way
[1:17:57] [Applause]
[1:18:01] if we hadn't said that to him five or
[1:18:03] six years ago he'd been a floor now he
[1:18:08] I'm sure his hands are dripping wet but
[1:18:15] we're an organism it takes all of us all
[1:18:20] right but they are training some some
[1:18:24] helping the band that's great I love
[1:18:26] cross-training man that means if
[1:18:28] somebody's out somebody step right in
[1:18:30] step four Bob somebody can step right
[1:18:32] hey but you know what some jobs you want
[1:18:35] to get fired from you want to get fired
[1:18:37] from that job that's good all right
[1:18:41] let's get back to what we're told by
[1:18:43] this six seal is the Tribulation Period
[1:18:46] that's what takes place now look the
[1:18:49] bride's gone do I need to stop for a
[1:18:54] moment or what sure okay yes yes okay
[1:19:07] oh yeah oh yeah he's entered into
[1:19:14] another dimension that's not what I
[1:19:17] thought when I was watching the thing
[1:19:19] though but I was actually thinking other
[1:19:22] things that I had to repent for but but
[1:19:28] see that's God working that's that's God
[1:19:30] working so that's okay right Bob he's
[1:19:35] like never touching that thing no more
[1:19:40] but the six a list of tribulation period
[1:19:43] that's what takes place but the bride is
[1:19:45] gone you said brother now why don't we
[1:19:47] have to cover this by the way why do we
[1:19:48] have to cover this because it is you it
[1:19:52] is you it is a disruption of your nature
[1:19:56] it is something that God has got to do
[1:19:58] to you that he's never done to a nice
[1:20:00] group of people before he's done it one
[1:20:04] time oh yeah that was tipped listen
[1:20:07] Abraham got a temporary body changed but
[1:20:10] Abraham could not
[1:20:12] say I'm alive forevermore no he had
[1:20:15] seven more kids and he died he's in the
[1:20:16] grave somewhere waiting on you and I
[1:20:20] okay so there's whole things waiting on
[1:20:22] us to come to a place so we're going
[1:20:26] through our tribulation now your sisters
[1:20:28] walk through Walmart
[1:20:30] it's a tribulation for the people that
[1:20:33] look at you and either laugh or scoff or
[1:20:36] say why do you have to do that right
[1:20:40] that's the tribulation you have created
[1:20:42] a tribulation pyrrha
[1:20:44] the tribulation doesn't start until we
[1:20:47] leave the real one the natural
[1:20:49] tribulation why because you're here
[1:20:52] because they're not going to start a
[1:20:53] tribulation with his old bride inside
[1:20:55] that tribulation no we're going to be
[1:20:59] gone the bride has gone see there's no
[1:21:02] living creature nothing there to say it
[1:21:04] it's just now God is not dealing with
[1:21:07] the church no more look after we leave
[1:21:10] that even the sixth seal brings in
[1:21:14] 144,000 but that's not the bride that's
[1:21:18] not the bride
[1:21:22] remember he's divorced his Jewish bride
[1:21:26] he cannot remarry her again but they can
[1:21:30] come back his sermons now God is not
[1:21:32] dealing with the church no more it's
[1:21:34] been gone he's dealing with Israel
[1:21:37] 144,000 this is the other side this is
[1:21:41] when Israel receives the message of the
[1:21:44] kingdom by the two prophets of
[1:21:46] revelations 11 remember we are not here
[1:21:49] when they start their message because
[1:21:52] the anointing that comes off of us goes
[1:21:55] right over to the Jews
[1:21:56] two witnesses first and then 144,000
[1:22:00] after that in 1260 days I believe it is
[1:22:04] remember Israel is the nation God's
[1:22:07] servant nation and when Israel is
[1:22:11] brought in it'll be a national affair
[1:22:14] Israel the kingdom agents were David the
[1:22:17] son of David set some throne there
[1:22:19] brother I'm doing that all the way to
[1:22:20] the Millenium because remember the
[1:22:22] Millennium is not to us
[1:22:24] the Millennium is to the Jews there was
[1:22:27] a promise Oh what we know there's a
[1:22:29] promise that that will live a thousand
[1:22:32] years because a thousand years of the
[1:22:34] day and God said the day you eat there
[1:22:35] we know all that but still bottom line
[1:22:38] is to the Jews
[1:22:39] it is a honeymoon for us we're there to
[1:22:44] observe and but listen we're going to be
[1:22:48] sitting beside King David because we're
[1:22:50] says bride hey man not literal David the
[1:22:55] son of David Jesus Christ is going to be
[1:22:58] sitting there but those 144,000 and
[1:23:01] whoever else is there fifty of juhi that
[1:23:03] whoever is going to be there will know
[1:23:05] that we're not Jews we're his Gentile
[1:23:11] bride because we're a mini membered body
[1:23:13] but they're gonna have tribal order will
[1:23:20] read it later on they'll have tribal
[1:23:22] order each one will have their tribes
[1:23:23] Dan Ephraim and all those all right I'll
[1:23:26] have their tribes they'll have their
[1:23:27] place to live there's a Millennial
[1:23:29] temple that's got to be built all these
[1:23:31] different things listen that Millennial
[1:23:33] temple does have nothing to do with me
[1:23:35] and you but when we walk into that
[1:23:38] temple according to brother Branham
[1:23:40] according to the six fold purpose of
[1:23:43] daniel seventy weeks the last one is to
[1:23:46] anoint the most holy
[1:23:47] it's not the jews coming back into the
[1:23:50] temple it's you and i because it's us
[1:23:54] and our husband it's the bride in the
[1:23:58] bridegroom walking into the temple
[1:24:01] anointing the temple with what not
[1:24:03] sacrifices not bad your skin human skin
[1:24:13] change human skin amen
[1:24:18] number three real quick
[1:24:25] number three we're stealing a 6-cell we
[1:24:29] find out now John said I beheld and when
[1:24:31] he had opened the sixth seal there was a
[1:24:33] great earthquake then all nature was
[1:24:35] interrupted God's been doing great
[1:24:38] things like healing the sick open the
[1:24:39] eyes of the blind doing great works but
[1:24:42] we find out here that nature takes that
[1:24:45] took a tumble yes
[1:24:47] all nature look what taking place the
[1:24:49] earthquake the Sun was black the moon
[1:24:51] wouldn't give its light and the stars
[1:24:53] shook and fail and why why everything
[1:24:56] happens see right at the time of the
[1:24:58] opening of this sixth seal so you and I
[1:25:01] don't get the literal opening of the
[1:25:03] seal it opens remember what brother
[1:25:06] Brown said the two prophets open the
[1:25:07] seal all right so we're not here but we
[1:25:10] get the spiritual implication we get to
[1:25:12] what the supernatural element that's
[1:25:14] underneath that seal you and I get it
[1:25:16] you and I have to have something happen
[1:25:19] to our body that no one has ever had
[1:25:22] happiness that one man and it's not us
[1:25:25] coming to like Bozo said easy move my
[1:25:29] hands young but the rest of them it's
[1:25:31] not you know and I still got these back
[1:25:33] problems but why Allah got some good hat
[1:25:35] no it's your total body your body is
[1:25:37] going to be changed in a moment in the
[1:25:39] twinkling of an eye and not a piece is
[1:25:42] gonna be left off and why everything
[1:25:47] happened right at the time of the
[1:25:48] opening of this sixth seal that's when
[1:25:49] it takes place right immediately after
[1:25:52] the announcement of those martyrs who
[1:25:54] are the martyrs fish seals you the
[1:25:57] martyrs had been finished in other words
[1:25:59] the martyrs been given white robes
[1:26:00] they're done actually they're in a place
[1:26:04] hello they're in a place John saw them
[1:26:09] in a place and they're there in a place
[1:26:10] until the hundred forty four thousand
[1:26:12] gets killed that's what the Bible says
[1:26:14] all right now number four now the
[1:26:18] earthquake let us compare scripture now
[1:26:21] you got pencil on paper I want you to do
[1:26:24] something for me
[1:26:25] if you want to write write these because
[1:26:28] unless you're going to take the tape now
[1:26:30] I want you to read with me as you do
[1:26:32] compare scriptures of this great event
[1:26:34] that we will see that this great secret
[1:26:37] or mystery that was under the sixth seal
[1:26:39] of the book of redemption so he's
[1:26:42] sliding that stick seal still in the
[1:26:44] book of redemption now remember these
[1:26:46] are hidden mysteries and the sixth seals
[1:26:51] altogether not I think he meant and I'm
[1:26:53] not interpolating here but I guess I am
[1:26:56] he's meaning six seals because the six
[1:26:58] seals not one book all six seals mate
[1:27:01] one book because remember the book of
[1:27:04] redemption is only six seals I'll read
[1:27:08] your quote okay back there six seals
[1:27:10] finishes Redemption that's all we're
[1:27:12] going to talk about the finished
[1:27:12] redemption is six seals the seventh is
[1:27:16] just a silence in heaven for half an
[1:27:18] hour that's all but you got to have him
[1:27:20] here to do all the to do the six alright
[1:27:23] that's the problem we we don't have him
[1:27:25] here all the way he's here we're just
[1:27:29] missing something something maybe we'll
[1:27:31] just quit missing stuff and the sixth
[1:27:33] seal altogether is one great big book
[1:27:35] just seat Scrolls rolled together and it
[1:27:38] unwinds the whole book of Redemption
[1:27:40] that's how the whole earth was redeemed
[1:27:43] and that's remember when we asked when
[1:27:45] he talks about Earth ain't talking about
[1:27:47] this ball because this earth will never
[1:27:51] get Redemption until you get redemption
[1:27:54] in your earth
[1:27:57] so who's you waiting on thank you you're
[1:28:01] getting Donnie you getting pretty quick
[1:28:02] me I figured you over there with that
[1:28:05] sunshine we'd be saying German talking
[1:28:07] cake anyway number five if that is so
[1:28:15] now for we know that this seek seal is
[1:28:17] the judgment seal so anything that
[1:28:20] happens under the sixth seal is a
[1:28:21] judgment I'm just reading what he said
[1:28:25] it's a judgment it's the judgment seal
[1:28:28] exactly what it is now see we've had the
[1:28:30] Antichrist ride seen the church go now
[1:28:34] it's finished
[1:28:35] goes up then we see the martyrs he's on
[1:28:38] the fifth seal of them Jews back there
[1:28:40] under the altar now here is the breaking
[1:28:42] fourth of the judgment upon the people
[1:28:45] were out of this tribulation judgment
[1:28:48] will come forth 144,000 redeemed
[1:28:51] Jews I'll prove to you they are Jews not
[1:28:54] Gentiles they have nothing to do with
[1:28:56] the bride not a thing and the bride we
[1:28:59] done seen the bride's gone you can't
[1:29:02] place that anywhere else don't come back
[1:29:05] until the 19th chapter of the book of
[1:29:07] Acts he means the 19th chapter of the
[1:29:08] book of revelations we know that now
[1:29:11] notice for the sixth seal is the
[1:29:13] judgment seal of the word thereby
[1:29:16] alright with that say men now what's
[1:29:19] gonna happen here let's go to Matthew 24
[1:29:22] and I want to stop here just a second
[1:29:24] just for a second
[1:29:25] mm-hmm if you've got your Bible if you
[1:29:27] want to turn to it you don't have to but
[1:29:30] what happens is in Matthew 24 Jesus
[1:29:33] preaches the seals right he preaches him
[1:29:38] right down the line till he gets to
[1:29:41] number five and then he stops because
[1:29:46] the sixth seal is Matthew 29 through 31
[1:29:52] look in your Bibles his history
[1:29:55] okay he separated it out because I
[1:30:00] believe the sixth seal to me that's your
[1:30:02] body change that's the change of your
[1:30:06] body right Jesus wants you to think
[1:30:11] about a little bit he's all right
[1:30:12] there's a guy he talks about something
[1:30:14] else right he talks about something else
[1:30:16] and then he says hey immediately after
[1:30:19] the tribulation of those days what the
[1:30:22] tribulation of you getting the body
[1:30:25] change now don't you think it's going to
[1:30:28] thunder and lightning and earthquake
[1:30:30] when your body gets changed when
[1:30:32] something eternal steps into this
[1:30:34] dimension and brings a bunch of people
[1:30:39] with it six dimension people come into
[1:30:44] this dimension man that's more eternal
[1:30:46] than you've ever seen on the face of
[1:30:48] this earth at one time all right
[1:30:51] this world is gonna go into chaos
[1:30:55] even for 30 to 40 days it can go into
[1:30:58] chaos that's not gonna bother you
[1:31:00] because you're gonna get a body change
[1:31:02] and you stand right in the middle of a
[1:31:04] nuclear explosion and it will not hurt
[1:31:06] you
[1:31:07] you say give me an apple while this
[1:31:09] thing blows up let me eat something I
[1:31:12] mean really didn't Jesus walk through a
[1:31:15] wall say give me some fish well what's
[1:31:18] the difference in walking through a wall
[1:31:19] and standing in front of a nuclear bomb
[1:31:20] none we just think old nuclear bomb will
[1:31:24] be all that no hey that's all down here
[1:31:28] has nothing to do with what you're gonna
[1:31:30] get immediately after the tribulation of
[1:31:33] those days shall the Sun be darkened and
[1:31:35] the moon shall not give her light and
[1:31:37] the stars shall fall from heaven and the
[1:31:39] powers of heaven shall be shaken doesn't
[1:31:40] that really sound like revelation and
[1:31:42] then shall the sign of the Son of man
[1:31:44] that and then shall appear the sign of
[1:31:47] the son of man in heaven
[1:31:50] what's your silence on a man
[1:31:52] resurrection resurrection and then shall
[1:31:58] all the tribes of the earth mourn and
[1:31:59] they shall see the Son of man coming in
[1:32:01] the clouds of heaven with power and
[1:32:02] great glory and he shall send His angels
[1:32:05] with a great sound of a trumpet and they
[1:32:07] shall gather together his elect from the
[1:32:08] four winds from one end of heaven to the
[1:32:11] other now we're gonna cover this I just
[1:32:13] want to read this kind of you know drop
[1:32:14] some breadcrumbs
[1:32:15] all right revelations 11 we're gonna
[1:32:19] read this because this is where the two
[1:32:20] witnesses come in and then we'll close
[1:32:22] because the sixth seal is probably going
[1:32:25] to take a little while to piece it all
[1:32:26] together and that was given me a reed
[1:32:29] like unto rod and the angel stood saying
[1:32:30] rise and measure the temple of God and
[1:32:32] the altar and them that worship therein
[1:32:34] but the court which is without the
[1:32:36] temple leave out and measure it not for
[1:32:38] it is given unto the Gentiles Jim
[1:32:41] Thompson going out of court and the Holy
[1:32:44] City shall they tread under foot forty
[1:32:47] and two months
[1:32:49] all right that's 42 months how long is
[1:32:52] that three and a half years according to
[1:32:55] the 30-day calendar they got that same
[1:32:58] am we covered the thirty day calendar
[1:33:00] brother Branham did that's your
[1:33:01] prophetic calendar not thirty one thirty
[1:33:03] twenty-eight thirty days to a month and
[1:33:07] then he
[1:33:08] topped out with your sisters you
[1:33:10] understand 28 to 30 days you understand
[1:33:12] the cycle of life goes through the same
[1:33:13] thing and I will give power unto my two
[1:33:16] witnesses and they shall prophesy a
[1:33:18] thousand two hundred and threescore
[1:33:21] which what is 3 times 2 6 so it's a
[1:33:24] thousand two hundred and sixty days
[1:33:25] clothed in sackcloth so they're gonna
[1:33:27] preach 1260 days now that's three and a
[1:33:29] half years not according to our calendar
[1:33:32] that's why you can't calculate Daniel
[1:33:35] seventy weeks down to a point because
[1:33:36] God uses his calendar of 30 days and we
[1:33:39] use 31 or the Gregorian or the Julian
[1:33:42] calendar which is up and down and we
[1:33:44] explained all that I don't think we did
[1:33:46] up here but we did downstairs the reason
[1:33:48] they have all that remember you're 29
[1:33:50] days in February because if you didn't
[1:33:54] keep counting that extra day over four
[1:33:55] years summer spring and you'd be having
[1:33:58] winter in the middle of July so they do
[1:34:01] that to reverse everything by because
[1:34:04] why because the Earth's tilted now
[1:34:06] during the millennium I don't think
[1:34:09] there's gonna be tilted I think it's
[1:34:10] gonna be standing straight up because
[1:34:12] when you and I come on this earth we're
[1:34:14] gonna be straight up right now we're
[1:34:17] kind of stooped over about 30 degrees
[1:34:21] yeah that was plenty weather really I
[1:34:24] mean really you know you won't be
[1:34:26] stooped over when you're 20 you went
[1:34:27] stooped over you stood straight on
[1:34:28] axis and I will give power unto
[1:34:31] my two witnesses and they shall prophesy
[1:34:35] 1203 score days clothed in sackcloth
[1:34:37] these are the two olive trees the two
[1:34:39] candlesticks standing before the god of
[1:34:41] the earth what is it two witnesses if
[1:34:43] any man will hurt them fire not literal
[1:34:45] fire they're not going to be
[1:34:46] fire-breathing dragons what the word
[1:34:50] whatever they say it's going to happen
[1:34:54] devoureth their enemies and if any man
[1:34:56] will hurt them he must in this manner be
[1:34:59] killed
[1:35:01] wow these have power to shut heaven that
[1:35:04] it rain not in the days of their
[1:35:06] prophecy which was Elijah three and a
[1:35:08] half years and have power over waters to
[1:35:11] turn to blood Moses in the Nile River
[1:35:13] and to smite the earth with all plagues
[1:35:15] as often as they will
[1:35:18] the whole worth like I said it's not
[1:35:21] just Jerusalem and not just his ruin
[1:35:23] Syria and whatever cuz you know what
[1:35:26] everybody's gonna try to kill them two
[1:35:28] guys and they're just gonna say nope
[1:35:31] that's not gonna happen you're dying and
[1:35:32] you understand what I'm saying
[1:35:34] and when they shall have finished their
[1:35:36] testimony I want to bring in a little
[1:35:38] fault right here it just it just came to
[1:35:41] me now you and I couldn't be the two
[1:35:45] witnesses we know that right
[1:35:47] because we're not Jews but we couldn't
[1:35:49] be the two witnesses and be the bride
[1:35:51] you wouldn't do that if you would stand
[1:35:55] on this earth and do that to somebody in
[1:36:00] other words you have no brotherly
[1:36:01] kindness you have power without
[1:36:04] character now I'm not saying they don't
[1:36:06] have power without character but there's
[1:36:07] prophesied of what they'll do but a true
[1:36:09] bride won't do that so they're not bride
[1:36:13] they're giving the baptism of the Holy
[1:36:14] Ghost but they're not bride hey man hey
[1:36:18] man they ain't gonna have time to preach
[1:36:21] statue of a perfect man they're gonna be
[1:36:24] perfect inside but look you and I can't
[1:36:26] do that
[1:36:27] we stole money this morning you got to
[1:36:29] Paul said in Romans 11 you've got to
[1:36:31] love those that hate you love them
[1:36:34] you got a agape love them not feel you
[1:36:38] love them you got a cop I love them it's
[1:36:41] easy for me to love brother Kali you
[1:36:46] look but what about somebody that hates
[1:36:50] your guts it's now I'm supposed to love
[1:36:54] them the same identical way as I love
[1:36:57] brother Kali or I have a problem with my
[1:37:00] brotherly kindness but it's real easy
[1:37:03] for me to love brother Kali but what
[1:37:07] about somebody in out in the street out
[1:37:09] here that's just none you're wrong and
[1:37:10] done everything in the world to you
[1:37:12] that's why brother Brown said that fifth
[1:37:14] seal Jew could not be bribed cuz they're
[1:37:17] saying avenge our blood what are you
[1:37:19] gonna kill these people when you gonna
[1:37:20] take them all the way another word
[1:37:22] avenge our blood but now you've never
[1:37:24] said that I hope being a Christian
[1:37:26] you've never said God avenge me on
[1:37:29] somebody else now
[1:37:30] that's not true you better not do that
[1:37:33] that's why brother Brown said power
[1:37:36] without character you've got the Holy
[1:37:37] Ghost even when you start but you can't
[1:37:40] go out there and start speaking things
[1:37:43] you might speak your boss out of
[1:37:45] existence one day and I'd be messy
[1:37:50] really I mean really we don't call
[1:37:52] judgment on nobody why the Bible says
[1:37:54] don't judge sure we're gonna stand in
[1:37:58] judgment no doubt but that's after all
[1:38:00] this is finished but we can't stand here
[1:38:02] and ain't say wow that guy cut me off
[1:38:04] Lord I wish you just flip his car over
[1:38:06] three or four times right we wouldn't do
[1:38:09] that would we it's not like L said O
[1:38:11] Lord see it wouldn't be in our character
[1:38:14] but these guys right here somebody does
[1:38:17] something to them they do it right back
[1:38:18] to them Moses and Elijah Old Testament
[1:38:22] prophets not born again sure they get
[1:38:28] the Holy Ghost but they're not bribed
[1:38:30] they're not they don't have sure they've
[1:38:32] got to have some part of the character
[1:38:33] of God but they nothing do this
[1:38:36] not and do that they can't brotherly
[1:38:40] kindness and if somebody does something
[1:38:42] to them they'd kill him if any man will
[1:38:45] hurt them he must in this manner be
[1:38:48] killed now you you might have thought
[1:38:54] that in your in your human yeah right
[1:38:58] yep thank you brother dick brother dick
[1:39:00] says they deserved it
[1:39:02] well see that's the way we look at it we
[1:39:03] look at why something happens something
[1:39:04] they deserve that no you noticed a
[1:39:06] Christian you don't say that you don't
[1:39:08] say that you have compassion Jesus said
[1:39:12] even on the cross they done nailed him
[1:39:13] to the cross and stripped his clothes
[1:39:15] off naked and pulled most of his beard
[1:39:18] out put a crown on his head and he said
[1:39:21] Father forgive them they don't know what
[1:39:24] they're doing see that's that's the
[1:39:25] bride hang in there that's not that's
[1:39:28] not that's not this that's the bride
[1:39:30] hang in there Father forgive them they
[1:39:32] know not what they're doing because what
[1:39:34] did Stephen do Stephen was being stoned
[1:39:36] by his own brethren that was his people
[1:39:40] that was stoning him and he said Father
[1:39:43] forgive them
[1:39:44] see that's the that's the Christian
[1:39:47] attitude that's the Holy Ghost filled
[1:39:49] born-again Christian attitude is that
[1:39:52] and then I just wanted to bring that out
[1:39:56] cuz sometimes you see that you go man
[1:39:58] they're really you know they don't have
[1:40:02] a lot of patience or something you know
[1:40:04] but they that's their Commission though
[1:40:06] it's when they come on this earth the
[1:40:09] Holy Ghost is gone the only listen the
[1:40:13] only people with the Holy Ghost when we
[1:40:15] leave is empty prophets in the whole
[1:40:18] world
[1:40:19] talk about demonic powers coming in and
[1:40:23] trying to kill them
[1:40:25] there's no bribe there there's no word
[1:40:27] to keep them except for two people out
[1:40:33] of seven billion people will see now
[1:40:35] we've got I'm going to just say we've
[1:40:37] got several million bribed around the
[1:40:39] world so we kind of keep a little white
[1:40:40] brother Larry around the earth but what
[1:40:43] if we're going to people in one little
[1:40:47] place called Israel we'll have the Holy
[1:40:51] Ghost and then which of course with no
[1:40:54] 144,000 will but that's why the whole
[1:40:56] the whole place is gonna cave in on them
[1:40:58] but that God's got to save them until
[1:41:02] the time I didn't read the rest of it
[1:41:04] but what happens at the end
[1:41:06] remember God kind of does like you did
[1:41:09] Jobe he said oh you know I'm gonna
[1:41:10] withdraw a little bit cuz he's gonna die
[1:41:12] they're gonna die but they're gonna
[1:41:13] resurrect back up and they're gonna go
[1:41:15] over another dimension and then that's
[1:41:16] what we're gonna look at in just a
[1:41:17] little while maybe next we're not next
[1:41:20] Sunday but the two prophets are that
[1:41:25] seal now what time we'll make a comment
[1:41:27] here and then we'll close musicians go
[1:41:29] in come brother branham said when the
[1:41:32] sixth seal I read it next Sunday when
[1:41:35] the sixth seal open he had to get up and
[1:41:39] walk out of the room something open to
[1:41:42] that prophet that he had not seen before
[1:41:45] that those two prophets were that seal
[1:41:48] all right I'm just gonna leave that with
[1:41:52] him we'll talk about a little bit later
[1:41:53] but he come to a realization that it
[1:41:57] takes a prophet
[1:41:58] to open the seal we know the prophets
[1:42:02] the Lord Jesus Christ but he needed an
[1:42:04] outlet or a conduit called william
[1:42:06] branham to open the seals amen
[1:42:09] hey the seventh seal preached to other
[1:42:12] cells on the earth and nobody got it
[1:42:17] okay now we had a little prophet come
[1:42:21] and he got it and he give it to us now
[1:42:26] we got to get it so who's going to get
[1:42:29] it man
[1:42:32] one more time who's gonna get it okay
[1:42:36] confession let's stand confession you
[1:42:41] confess you show bro wait that makes no
[1:42:45] if you know who the real I am is you're
[1:42:47] not saying you the human person you're
[1:42:52] saying you the Holy Ghost that you have
[1:42:55] in your soul what was singing Louise

[1:43:03] song god bless you thank you again for
[1:43:07] what you did this weekend we'll have I'm
[1:43:13] sure we'll have lots of chances to do it
[1:43:14] again
[1:43:16] let's just sing a song just remember
[1:43:19] before we get started helmet Billy this
[1:43:22] six sale when it opens it's like
[1:43:26] something's never been on this earth
[1:43:28] before but now when it happened to Jesus
[1:43:32] when Jesus come to a place we know where
[1:43:35] there was an earthquake we know that the
[1:43:37] Sun darkened right mill today Sun became
[1:43:41] black there was an earthquake there was
[1:43:43] a lot of things happen that was one man
[1:43:47] but when a collective body does it this
[1:43:51] earth has got a shape because we're
[1:43:54] connected to this earth and it's got a
[1:43:55] shake when those millions break that
[1:43:58] barrier of that dimension into this
[1:44:00] dimension and then we're changed in the
[1:44:03] moment there's something gonna happen to
[1:44:04] this earth but something's got to happen
[1:44:06] to this earth first
[1:44:12] [Music]
[1:44:28] Lord is coming back to earth again take
[1:44:32] it to it Oh Lord is coming by to earth

[1:44:47] will have no temper then after Jesus
[1:44:51] shall come back to earth again Jesus
[1:44:55] coming back will be the answer to our
[1:44:58] soaring crime for the knowledge of the
[1:45:02] Lord shall fill the earth the sea and
[1:45:05] Scott God shall take away all sickness

[1:45:22] our Lord is coming by toward the gate

[1:45:58] then the sin and sorrow pain and depth
[1:46:02] of this dark world shall cease in a
[1:46:05] glorious reign with Jesus of a thousand
[1:46:08] years of peace all the earth is groaning
[1:46:11] crying for that day of sweet release for
[1:46:15] Jesus to come back to earth again Oh
[1:46:25] yes our Lord
[1:46:27] coming my torch again
[1:46:30] and we'll be found a thousand years will
[1:46:34] have no pimp through them after Jesus
[1:46:37] shall come back birth again you know
[1:46:41] under the revelation that they had when
[1:46:43] they wrote this song that's right but we
[1:46:49] know he's not coming he's here and we're
[1:46:54] not waiting for him to come back to
[1:46:57] earth again yeah we're waiting for the
[1:46:58] physical man but that physical man
[1:47:00] cannot come back to this earth until
[1:47:03] he's changed your body and my body and
[1:47:08] we go to a wedding supper we come back
[1:47:11] to earth see there's that one thing was
[1:47:16] well when Jesus comes back listen you
[1:47:20] can't see him without seeing us you
[1:47:25] can't see him without seeing us see
[1:47:28] that's the mystery in the end time it's
[1:47:31] the bride is she and she is him she has
[1:47:35] made manifest in another form called
[1:47:38] Jesus Christ Jesus coming back will be
[1:47:42] the answer to Earth's soaring cry for
[1:47:44] the knowledge of the Lord we know that's
[1:47:45] all gonna happen but what about now what
[1:47:49] about now there's not a millennium ever
[1:47:54] gonna happen until me and you take a
[1:47:56] body change will not happen cannot
[1:47:58] happen
[1:47:59] it's like brother Brown said Jesus was
[1:48:00] barred from coming out of the tomb right
[1:48:03] by scripture that was the bar there that
[1:48:05] said you had to be in the earth three
[1:48:07] days and three nights or whatever it was
[1:48:08] same way with me and you came to
[1:48:12] millennium - until the bride takes the
[1:48:16] body change steps over in another
[1:48:18] dimension let's God and I mean let's man
[1:48:20] wipe this thing off it'll be it'll be
[1:48:23] man's battle that want to be man's
[1:48:25] battle then we'll come back into
[1:48:27] millennium and we'll be able to just
[1:48:30] enjoy but really that's not our home
[1:48:34] that's not our house that millenium
[1:48:37] temple it's not our house
[1:48:38] that whole thousand years is not ours
[1:48:41] it's an allotted piece of time for the
[1:48:44] Jews to learn what they missed learn
[1:48:50] about what they miss sure they knew
[1:48:52] about amen they know about the temple
[1:48:54] they know what this thing is right here
