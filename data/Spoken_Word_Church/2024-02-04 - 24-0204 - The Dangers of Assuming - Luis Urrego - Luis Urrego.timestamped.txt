[0:01] amen appreciate the Lord and giving us
[0:04] another another day of life amen we
[0:08] don't deserve it but he he gave it to us
[0:12] amen and we're going to make this day
[0:13] the best that we can right give him
[0:16] praise amen well let's just bow our
[0:18] heads one more time before we continue
[0:20] our heavenly father we just come before
[0:23] you once again Lord and just thanking
[0:25] you father for the opportunity that we
[0:27] have to serve you and to come and
[0:29] worship you in spirit and in truth Lord
[0:31] to Feast upon your word Lord we pray
[0:34] that you would have your way here this
[0:35] morning and give us something Lord God
[0:37] that we can take with us and immediately
[0:40] apply in our lives Lord Jesus and uh you
[0:42] just uh use my lips this morning and
[0:45] Lord you just continue to be with
[0:47] everyone father God that is traveling
[0:50] and and sick father you know every need
[0:53] father that was mentioned here and we
[0:55] just ask these things now in Jesus
[0:57] Christ's name amen amen praise the Lord
[0:59] Lord Jesus we're going to go to uh uh
[1:02] I'm not going to show any scriptures on
[1:04] the on the screen so
[1:07] um just turn there or they can put him
[1:09] up on the screen but uh it's in 1
[1:12] Corinthians chapter
[1:14] 4 and um verse verse four it says this
[1:18] for I Know Nothing by myself yet am I
[1:22] not hereby Justified but he that judgeth
[1:24] me is the Lord
[1:27] therefore and this is the the verse I
[1:29] wanted concentrate on therefore judge
[1:32] nothing before the time judge nothing
[1:36] before the time until the Lord come who
[1:40] both will bring to light the hidden
[1:42] things of darkness and will make
[1:44] manifest the councils of the hearts and
[1:48] then shall every man have Praise of God
[1:53] and so I wanted to concentrate on that
[1:55] amen now you know brother brandom he
[1:57] talked about he T he preached a message
[1:59] called presuming anden and and and and
[2:03] he he said that the uh he looked at at
[2:06] the at the uh the definition of the word
[2:09] presuming and it it was to venture
[2:11] without Authority and um but sometimes
[2:14] we get confused as to when to use the
[2:16] word presuming and the word assuming
[2:19] because they're very very very much
[2:21] alike and uh so I I brought up Webster's
[2:24] Dictionary nowadays and and and and this
[2:27] is what what what both of those mean
[2:30] amen it says that although presume and
[2:34] assume both mean to take something as
[2:36] true presume implies more confidence or
[2:41] evidence backed reasoning right when you
[2:44] presume something um you know I'm
[2:46] presuming that that that that my car is
[2:49] out there you know in the parking lot
[2:52] because I drove it here this morning
[2:55] that was that's the evidence that I have
[2:58] but now assuming doesn't doesn't have
[3:00] any evidence backing it up you just
[3:02] assume I assume that brother Don's Car
[3:04] is out there but I didn't see him pull
[3:06] pull up the car but I'm assuming I'm
[3:09] just thinking that and and we do that a
[3:14] lot we just venture to think things
[3:19] about others about about situations and
[3:23] you have no Speck of proof whatsoever
[3:26] right that's what assuming is now
[3:28] presuming is the proof is there but you
[3:32] don't know that yet it's true or not so
[3:35] there's a little bit there's another
[3:37] little layer of of of Truth there with
[3:40] presuming whereas assuming you don't
[3:42] have any layer of Truth yet you're
[3:44] stating something as a fact and that's
[3:46] Dangerous Ground as for us as Christians
[3:48] to walk upon it's very easy for us to
[3:51] judge Paul clearly tells us here don't
[3:54] judge things before the time let the
[3:57] Lord take care of those things amen
[3:59] because then what will we be doing when
[4:01] we have no proof or backing it up we are
[4:04] just assuming we are just thinking that
[4:07] that's how things are when in reality
[4:09] you have nothing to back what you're
[4:12] what you're saying you see so it
[4:15] continues to say here assume and presume
[4:17] both mean to take something for granted
[4:20] or to take something as true the
[4:22] difference between the words lies in the
[4:25] degree of confidence held by the speaker
[4:28] or writer if he or she is making an
[4:31] informed guess based on reasonable
[4:33] evidence presume is the word to use if a
[4:38] guess is made based on little or no
[4:40] evidence assume is usually used so that
[4:45] is uh that is what presume and and
[4:49] assume mean
[4:50] now I I I was looking through the
[4:53] scripture and and I I I came to the um
[4:57] the story of of of the priest Eli and
[5:01] and Hannah and uh and when when Hannah
[5:05] if you remember Hannah went she was
[5:07] travailing before God because she
[5:09] couldn't have children and she asked the
[5:11] L she was she went down to the uh near
[5:14] the temple and she was there praying
[5:17] that the Lord give her a child and that
[5:18] she was going to dedicate it to it well
[5:20] Eli the priest a holy man a man that was
[5:24] dedicated to God here he is looking at
[5:27] Hannah thinking that she had had too
[5:30] much
[5:31] wine because she was there crying she
[5:34] was there travailing before God maybe
[5:37] she was shaking maybe she was she was
[5:40] really praying to the Lord but in his
[5:44] judgment he thought that she was
[5:47] drunk not knowing that she was actually
[5:50] doing a spiritual thing and asking God
[5:53] to do something for her because she was
[5:56] in need how many times you know we we we
[5:59] we we do that so many so many times you
[6:02] know you know we we see the the actions
[6:04] of individuals and and we look at them
[6:07] and we immediately judge those actions
[6:10] with something that we you know from
[6:13] previous experiences that we've had and
[6:16] we can't do that to
[6:19] people uh sister Rebecca brother Eric's
[6:22] wife that was here from
[6:24] Honduras they were on the airplane
[6:26] coming here to the states and she wanted
[6:30] to sit there with her husband on the
[6:32] same seat because so he could help her
[6:35] with the baby so uh their their seats
[6:39] were separate and so there was a lady
[6:42] there that she had asked is it possible
[6:45] that that that my husband could sit here
[6:47] and you can just take his seat Well she
[6:49] didn't want to give up her seat and she
[6:52] and and
[6:53] so um they um the lady started talking
[6:58] to her husband cuz her husband was
[7:00] sitting next to her and she she kept
[7:01] telling him I'm not giving up my seat I
[7:04] paid for this seat and all you know and
[7:06] she was just being real nasty about it
[7:08] but she was thinking that Rebecca
[7:11] couldn't speak English so she's there
[7:13] talking to her husband the whole time
[7:15] about her the lady comes through and
[7:18] asks you know what does she want does
[7:21] she want coffee does she want tea the
[7:23] lady that works in the airplane the
[7:24] steward is Lady and Rebecca just started
[7:27] talking to her in plain English I want
[7:29] uh coffee or you know this and and the
[7:32] husband he said she said that she heard
[7:35] uh the husband tell
[7:36] her
[7:38] [Laughter]
[7:41] English so you can't
[7:43] assume assume makes you look
[7:46] dumb when you assume things that you
[7:50] have no no evidence what you know uh
[7:54] there was a pastor as at the Wesleyan
[7:57] Church he he he was an American man
[7:59] and he spoke very well uh Spanish and he
[8:03] had a little Spanish congregation he was
[8:04] trying to help there in in Greenville
[8:07] South Carolina and that's we were going
[8:09] there with him for a while before we
[8:11] came to the message and uh he said he
[8:14] was at a Waffle House one time and there
[8:16] was some Latinos in there you know
[8:19] talking about him you know I don't know
[8:20] what they were saying and he just turned
[8:22] to them and and started talking to him
[8:24] in Spanish and
[8:25] [Laughter]
[8:27] he so you you can't really especially
[8:30] nowadays you know you can't assume who
[8:33] speaks Spanish and who doesn't or who
[8:35] speaks English and who doesn't because
[8:38] uh sometimes the ones that look like
[8:40] they speak Spanish they
[8:42] don't and then sometimes the ones that
[8:44] speak that we think they speak English
[8:46] and they don't so so it's it's it's it's
[8:49] a very very tricky ground for you to
[8:52] assume or presume you
[8:55] see that you know uh because because
[8:59] what happens is that sometimes
[9:01] assumptions um makes us think like we we
[9:05] we we we know the answer to questions
[9:08] and in reality we don't we don't have
[9:11] the answers to questions you see it
[9:13] makes you look foolish sometimes when
[9:15] you are judging things before the time
[9:18] so here was here was uh Eli he was
[9:21] judging Hannah when Hannah was actually
[9:24] doing a good deed and he was presuming
[9:27] now see it happens to E any one of us it
[9:30] can happen to to to to no matter what
[9:33] your position is Eli was a was a priest
[9:36] before
[9:37] God but maybe you know I don't know see
[9:41] he his two sons he had two sons who who
[9:44] were were not living right and they were
[9:47] probably getting drunk and stuff like
[9:48] that too and so he's he's seeing that so
[9:51] much that he thinks that that's what
[9:53] Hannah was there to do as well that she
[9:55] was there drunk but in reality she was
[9:57] not so
[9:59] so sometimes assumptions um assumptions
[10:03] they ask the right questions but we jump
[10:06] too quickly to conclusions you see and
[10:09] and and and and you can see that in the
[10:11] case of of job when job he he the Lord
[10:16] allowed Satan to touch his life he said
[10:19] you can touch your his life but don't
[10:21] don't kill him you know that's that was
[10:24] only for the Lord and so here he here is
[10:27] here are job's friends and they're all
[10:29] around here and they're
[10:31] assuming without any evidence that job
[10:35] had committed sin and therefore he was
[10:38] in the condition that he's in but the
[10:41] Bible says that job was a righteous man
[10:44] and in so much that he would actually
[10:47] sacrifice and he would give offerings to
[10:49] the Lord even for his own children just
[10:52] in case if they have sinned so he was
[10:55] concerned about himself and about his
[10:57] family and the the Lord blessed them the
[11:00] Lord blessed them greatly but here are
[11:02] these Men supposed to be his friends and
[11:05] they're assuming without any evidence
[11:09] that he had sinned and they were trying
[11:11] to give him the the the solution to the
[11:14] problem when in reality that wasn't what
[11:17] job was needing we know that later on
[11:19] you know God shows him the reality of of
[11:21] of of how things are so we can't we
[11:24] can't assume we can't jump too quickly
[11:27] Amen to to uh to to to assumptions amen
[11:32] amen
[11:34] um and and and and we know that also
[11:37] that our our natural
[11:39] assumptions uh our assumptions our own
[11:43] human assumptions they they don't they
[11:45] usually don't align with with God's
[11:48] thinking with the way God thinks and the
[11:51] way God sees
[11:52] individuals all right you know we
[11:55] sometimes we see our individuals and we
[11:58] and we think you know what there's no
[11:59] hope for that person but not in God's
[12:02] eyes God doesn't see that God can change
[12:07] the hearts whereas you can't change
[12:09] hearts and sometimes we see our children
[12:12] in that way and we think you know what
[12:15] my my my son my daughter you know I I
[12:17] don't know that they're just so far gone
[12:20] but God doesn't see it that way there's
[12:23] nothing too there's nothing impossible
[12:26] for God is there anything too hard for
[12:29] the
[12:29] Lord and see and so you're assuming
[12:32] you're you're you're seeing uh uh you're
[12:36] it's your own personal experience for
[12:38] example Sarah you know she was listening
[12:40] to to to the angel telling Abraham
[12:44] you're going your your wife's going to
[12:46] have a do a son she's going to give
[12:48] birth and she was old as she was
[12:50] listening in the tent behind them and in
[12:54] her mind and in her own human uh uh ways
[12:58] she's a assuming wait a second if I put
[13:00] I put two plus two together I get four
[13:02] I'm old I can't have children anymore
[13:05] how is that going to
[13:06] happen and because of her assumption she
[13:10] was getting ready to get in
[13:13] trouble the angel Lord you know was God
[13:16] could have struck her right there but
[13:18] because of Abraham and man stepped in
[13:20] for her and also because he was part of
[13:24] her and she was part of him amen God
[13:26] could not hurt her and but God heard it
[13:30] God heard that she was assuming that God
[13:33] could not do what he said that he was
[13:35] going to do right there at the moment so
[13:38] we can't
[13:39] assume amen that that what we have to
[13:42] take everything that God says in his
[13:44] word as is
[13:47] truth amen amen and that and we even if
[13:51] we don't see the results or the
[13:53] happening right there and then God said
[13:56] it and as brother Billy Paul used to say
[13:58] God said it I believe it that settles it
[14:01] right amen you just it it's better to
[14:04] live life that way instead of
[14:06] having a negativity about about
[14:10] everything well God said it but you see
[14:13] she acts this way she does this he does
[14:16] this she you see is a better way God can
[14:20] change the heart look he he changed the
[14:21] heart of of King Nebuchadnezzar one day
[14:25] he he changes the hearts of of of of of
[14:28] of the most vile man in the and and he
[14:30] changed your
[14:32] heart amen why couldn't he do that with
[14:34] your with your daughter or with your son
[14:37] or with your family member or that that
[14:39] person that you're praying for God is
[14:42] more than able so we can't assume that
[14:45] God's word can't apply to him or her and
[14:48] because God's word is
[14:49] true praise the Lord Jesus
[14:53] amen um let's see here now also fear can
[14:58] cause us to assume uh the worst about
[15:01] people and and also their
[15:03] intentions when we have fear and we're
[15:06] not thinking right we we we we we we
[15:10] sometimes we think that uh someone's out
[15:13] to get
[15:13] [Laughter]
[15:15] me uh somebody's somebody's out there uh
[15:20] uh just ready to pounce on me whenever
[15:22] but see fear causes you to act that way
[15:25] that's why the Bible says do not fear it
[15:28] tells us fear fear is a Tormentor so so
[15:33] fear causes us to assume things causes
[15:36] us to judge things and then there's
[15:39] there's nothing there for us to there's
[15:41] no evidence of it you
[15:43] see um you know it's just like just like
[15:47] a little a little kid in in a bedroom
[15:49] who's scared you know at night and he
[15:51] just really really thinks that there's
[15:53] something in that
[15:55] closet I mean he really really believes
[15:57] it and and and and and and in the and he
[16:01] believes it so much that it actually
[16:03] becomes
[16:05] real he his imagination brings up this
[16:09] thing and he starts screaming in the
[16:13] middle of the night Mommy I saw I saw
[16:16] something I I really saw I saw a hand
[16:18] come out of that
[16:20] closet but it was all in his
[16:23] head now you just be you as parents you
[16:26] know you just be very tender about those
[16:28] things because to them that's real so
[16:31] you have to handle those things you know
[16:34] with a with a soft glove you know and
[16:36] just like boy just go to
[16:39] bed pow go to bed they're going to
[16:42] remember that the rest of their life
[16:44] Mommy and Daddy they don't believe what
[16:46] I you know nothing I tell them you see
[16:49] so handle that with with some softness
[16:52] but some truth at the same time you see
[16:55] praise God so it it so fear it could it
[16:57] could makes a it makes makes us
[16:58] suspicious and paranoid about people you
[17:02] know sometimes we think oh they're
[17:03] they're out they're out to get me
[17:05] they're out they're they're scheming
[17:07] something and it makes you paranoid
[17:09] about people and you can't trust people
[17:11] even people at
[17:13] church you can't even trust them because
[17:15] you're paranoid and you're assuming that
[17:18] people are out to get you and that's
[17:20] wrong that's not how a Christian should
[17:22] live yeah that's fear and fear fear
[17:26] causes torment torment your mind
[17:31] amen assumptions they're um and we know
[17:35] that assumptions they're they're they're
[17:37] made
[17:38] quickly and we talked about the human
[17:41] Viewpoint of of assumption and wrong
[17:44] assumptions they also they lead they
[17:46] lead us to
[17:47] arguments and and and and it threatens
[17:51] our relationships with individuals when
[17:54] you are
[17:55] assuming amen the the wrong side of
[17:58] things when you have no evidence
[18:00] remember assumption is you thinking that
[18:04] something is true when you don't have
[18:06] the
[18:06] evidence and then presum presuming
[18:10] there's a layer of evidence there but
[18:12] you still don't know yet if it's true or
[18:15] not so either one is still you can't do
[18:19] either one now brother Brandon when he
[18:21] preached that message presuming he was
[18:23] he was talking about how individuals
[18:25] they think because they've had an
[18:27] experience in the church or they shook
[18:30] the the pastor's hand or they they they
[18:33] set a couple of Hell marries or or they
[18:36] did something good in the church that
[18:39] that immediately takes them to Heaven
[18:41] that's you presuming there's evidence
[18:44] there that you did something good sure
[18:47] everybody saw it but that does not put
[18:51] you in the kingdom of God you can only
[18:53] come into the kingdom of God is by a new
[18:56] birth a new birth amen is what brings
[18:59] you that now that is sure when you have
[19:01] a new birth there is no assumption then
[19:04] about am I going to heaven or after this
[19:07] life or not amen you experience
[19:09] something real that changes you from the
[19:12] inside out amen amen so assumptions and
[19:15] and presumptions amen they they are
[19:18] danger they are dangerous and like I
[19:21] just said you know when uh they they can
[19:24] damage the relationship with people you
[19:26] know sometimes we think that we're so
[19:28] right that that and we just assume
[19:32] everybody else is
[19:33] wrong and we and we act and we live our
[19:36] life like
[19:38] that and what you are doing is you're
[19:40] making you're making people to not even
[19:43] want to be around
[19:45] you you you you you you you actively
[19:48] judge people before you know anything
[19:52] about that person or about that person's
[19:55] situation I certainly don't want to be
[19:58] around around people that are constantly
[19:59] judging judge judging
[20:01] me you know i' rather live my life uh um
[20:06] you know expecting the best out of
[20:08] people right right and then let things
[20:12] be sorted out in their
[20:14] time right in time things will will
[20:18] happen in time the smoke will clear and
[20:22] then you will see the the the clear
[20:24] picture but it it while while you don't
[20:28] know the evidence or while you have no
[20:30] no no nothing that you can fully grasp
[20:34] amen just give people the benefit of the
[20:36] doubt amen right I I would think that
[20:39] that Jesus that's what he would have
[20:41] done right now there's clear sin there's
[20:46] clear there's there's you know you see
[20:48] out here someone you know a brother or a
[20:51] sister you know smacking somebody out
[20:52] here in the parking lot you know that's
[20:55] that that's clear you know that's clear
[20:58] well I'm going to give them the benefit
[21:00] of the doubt that they were not smacking
[21:02] that sister in the face I'm just going
[21:05] to no you do something about that all
[21:08] right you stop the situation you're
[21:11] you're you're you know for the benefit
[21:12] of both of them but when there's things
[21:15] you know that you're just not not sure
[21:17] about amen you just lay them before the
[21:20] Lord am he's the one that knows all
[21:23] things he knows all Hearts he knows all
[21:27] situations
[21:28] and he knows every detail of every
[21:31] situation all right so is that's the
[21:35] best thing to do
[21:36] amen praise the Lord and then
[21:40] um sometimes assumptions that causes us
[21:43] to to give upon
[21:44] people man and this goes back to what I
[21:47] was saying earlier you know sometimes we
[21:50] we we we see people sometimes in the
[21:53] world so far gone and you think my
[21:55] there's just no hope for that person
[21:58] but God has done some miraculous things
[22:01] in in in this world that you don't even
[22:04] know about we don't know about you know
[22:08] you read about the testimonies of of
[22:10] individuals who were um satanists and
[22:14] murderers and and and all kinds of
[22:17] people vile people that you would not
[22:19] think that God could save and change
[22:21] their lives and they've become to be
[22:24] some of the the best
[22:26] Christians in the world
[22:28] yes it wasn't they that did that it was
[22:31] God that changed the hearts so don't
[22:34] look at people and and think you know
[22:36] there's no hope for for him or her amen
[22:39] There's Hope for everybody amen oh and
[22:42] as I always said you know as you're if
[22:45] while you're still sucking air There's
[22:46] Hope for you don't assume that about
[22:49] yourself either don't assume I've just
[22:52] gone too far I've I've send my my my way
[22:56] my day of Grace you can't do that you're
[23:00] still here you're still alive if God
[23:03] didn't want you to be here you just
[23:05] wouldn't be
[23:06] here God's the one who takes life and
[23:09] he's the one that gives life right so
[23:13] you're here for a purpose amen praise
[23:17] God and then sometimes an assumption uh
[23:20] it causes misunder understandings and of
[23:23] course you know we just read that about
[23:25] it damages it damages people you see it
[23:27] hurts it hurts relationships right you
[23:32] can't trust the person people anymore
[23:34] when they're assuming about your life in
[23:36] certain ways when in reality that's not
[23:38] it right we have we've all had
[23:41] experiences you know where people assume
[23:44] the wrong thing about
[23:46] us and then you try to just you try to
[23:49] show them the reality or the truth about
[23:51] it but it's so in their mind that that's
[23:54] how it is you know that that you just
[23:57] can't change that and then you just have
[23:59] to move on and let the Lord do the work
[24:03] amen sometimes people live their life
[24:05] that they always have to prove they they
[24:08] they that they're
[24:10] right you know you they always have to
[24:13] prove it some way or another and I'd
[24:17] rather just just move on let you know
[24:20] just just let the Lord sort that out you
[24:24] know as as Paul said and we were just
[24:27] reading here did he say he said
[24:29] therefore judge nothing before the time
[24:32] until the Lord come in other words let
[24:34] the Lord sort it out who both will bring
[24:37] to light the hidden things of darkness
[24:40] and will make manifest the counsels of
[24:43] the heart and then shall every man have
[24:47] Praise of God right you know sometimes
[24:50] we worry about you know uh the hidden
[24:53] things of what goes on in the world and
[24:56] you know I get caught up with things
[24:57] things like that too I I like looking at
[24:59] the news behind the news and you know
[25:02] what goes on behind the scenes you
[25:04] know
[25:06] but sometimes you get caught up in those
[25:08] rabbit holes so much and then and then
[25:10] you you come to a point where like well
[25:12] who
[25:13] knows but God
[25:16] knows
[25:18] right God knows because God created
[25:20] those
[25:21] individuals and eventually the smoke
[25:24] will clear and the dust will settle
[25:28] and those truths will come out there's
[25:31] nothing that's going to there's nothing
[25:32] that's going to be hidden amen so IID
[25:37] like to finish with this in Proverbs
[25:38] 10:28 it says the hopes of The Godly
[25:41] result in
[25:44] happiness but the expectations of the
[25:47] wicked they come to
[25:49] nothing right so the hopes all right the
[25:53] hopes of The Godly and I'm I'm I'm
[25:56] assuming
[25:59] that your hopes the hopes of The Godly
[26:01] are good
[26:02] hopes right and that they're going to uh
[26:07] they they allow us to have happier lives
[26:11] and more uh TR tranquil lives instead of
[26:14] prejudging people before the time right
[26:19] in 1 Corinthians 4:5 it says so don't
[26:21] make judgments and we just read about
[26:22] that but this is a different a different
[26:24] uh um um
[26:28] I'm sorry another another uh Bible
[26:32] translation so don't make judgments
[26:34] about anyone ahead of time before the
[26:36] Lord returns for he will bring our
[26:39] darkest secrets to light and we will
[26:42] reveal our private
[26:45] motives then God will give to each one
[26:48] Whatever praise is due Amen Let the dust
[26:53] settle let things clear up let things
[26:56] let things uh uh uh uh just settle down
[26:59] and before we start making
[27:02] assumptions before we start prejudging
[27:05] people because the Bible clearly tells
[27:08] us and Jesus said this he said let's
[27:11] leave let's live peaceably with people
[27:15] I'm just paraphrasing do everything that
[27:17] you can in your possible way to have
[27:21] peace with
[27:23] people right and that is one of the ways
[27:26] to do that do not assume that just
[27:29] because a person looks a certain way or
[27:32] just because a person said something or
[27:35] you have no evidence of that therefore
[27:38] you should not prejudge or assume when
[27:41] you you don't even live with the person
[27:43] in their house you don't know what's
[27:45] going on you don't know what happens in
[27:47] their head especially when they hardly
[27:49] don't say anything or they don't talk
[27:52] much you don't know and and sometimes as
[27:55] us as ministers you know that's kind of
[27:57] hard you know when we're sitting here
[27:59] preaching and we're looking at people
[28:01] and we're prejudging already what people
[28:03] are thinking about our
[28:06] sermon we think that people are not
[28:08] listening or that they're mad when
[28:09] they're looking at
[28:12] us when in reality I'm having to
[28:15] understand that more and more is that
[28:16] all they're doing is just paying
[28:18] attention but because they're not saying
[28:20] amen or because you know they're not
[28:23] we're already assuming that they don't
[28:25] like what we're saying and that that
[28:28] that makes us look foolish as a minister
[28:32] so we don't want to do that I have to
[28:33] put myself in there because uh that's we
[28:37] do that so much all right we are we We
[28:41] Are Who We Are we we're the church that
[28:43] we are we're not we don't jump and Shout
[28:46] like you know at other churches but that
[28:48] doesn't mean that the word is not
[28:50] getting to
[28:52] youen we don't we it's getting to you
[28:56] and I'm coming to realize that more and
[28:58] more and more right somebody falls
[29:01] asleep oh
[29:03] well maybe that part wasn't for them
[29:07] right or maybe they're just very they're
[29:09] just older and they just need to rest
[29:11] they're very
[29:13] tired brother
[29:16] colie but anyways God bless you all we
[29:19] love y'all amen praise the
[29:26] Lord
