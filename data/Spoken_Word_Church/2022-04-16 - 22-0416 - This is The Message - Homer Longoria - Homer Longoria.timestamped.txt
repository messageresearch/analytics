[57:26] or missing your opportunity
[57:30] missing your opportunity amen
[57:33] amen you know now we know that the bride
[57:35] won't
[57:36] amen we know the bride's not but there's
[57:39] people can miss their opportunity
[57:42] can you say amen
[57:44] amen so the bible says amen in verse
[57:46] number
[57:47] uh excuse me verse number 17
[57:51] and when he had gone forth into the way
[57:55] there came one running
[57:56] and he knelt down and he asked him good
[57:58] master
[58:00] what shall i do that i may inherit
[58:02] eternal life
[58:03] and jesus said unto him
[58:05] why call us down me good there's
[58:08] there's none good but one that's god
[58:11] thus
[58:12] thou knowest the commandment
[58:14] so he'd been he'd been in church all his
[58:16] life
[58:17] thou knowest the commandment do not
[58:19] commit adultery do not kill
[58:21] do not still do not bear fall witness
[58:24] defraud
[58:25] not father nor thy
[58:27] mother excuse me thy father and our
[58:29] mother and he answered and said
[58:33] unto him master
[58:35] i've got a testimony
[58:38] i've done this
[58:40] i've done this amen he said
[58:43] he said master all these have i observed
[58:47] from my youth
[58:49] then jesus behold him loved him so the
[58:52] love of god don't put you in heaven
[58:57] because god can't break his own word
[58:59] that's right
[59:00] amen
[59:02] so jesus loved him amen you know we we
[59:05] hear this story all the time how that
[59:07] jesus loves you and all of the amen and
[59:09] he does right yeah amen but he can't
[59:12] break his word for you
[59:14] can you say amen
[59:16] amen jesus loved him amen and he said
[59:19] one thing thou likest
[59:21] go
[59:22] thy way sell whatsoever thy has and give
[59:25] to the poor
[59:27] and thou shalt have treasures
[59:29] in heaven
[59:30] come take up thy cross
[59:33] and follow me
[59:34] heavenly father i want to thank you
[59:36] tonight god for being able to be here
[59:38] and bless your bless your word tonight
[59:41] father bless your people father get
[59:43] glory out of the service in jesus name
[59:46] amen you may be seated tonight amen and
[59:49] i want to look at that tonight by the
[59:51] help of the lord and
[59:53] amen and missing your opportunity
[59:56] and you say amen
[59:57] amen now this man amen he had every
[1:00:00] opportunity in the world
[1:00:02] to receive life
[1:00:04] amen now i understand he was not bright
[1:00:09] amen because he was not elected amen
[1:00:11] because he couldn't have missed it
[1:00:13] amen but you have an opportunity and and
[1:00:16] i want you to know brother tim we're
[1:00:17] looking at it in this hour that how many
[1:00:20] people is leaving the message
[1:00:22] amen but they had an opportunity to make
[1:00:24] it right amen because god's not a
[1:00:27] respectable person
[1:00:28] amen so he gives you an opportunity
[1:00:30] because he said he would that all come
[1:00:33] to repentance
[1:00:34] he would that all amen amen would make
[1:00:37] his transition right is that all right
[1:00:40] amen but while we see in this hour amen
[1:00:43] that there's many fallen by the wayside
[1:00:46] they had the same opportunity
[1:00:48] amen they probably kept all the
[1:00:50] commandments
[1:00:51] they probably kept all the holiness
[1:00:54] they tried to live right for year after
[1:00:57] year
[1:00:58] amen but something began to happen
[1:01:01] yeah right amen amen as this young man
[1:01:04] amen the bible said amen he said all
[1:01:07] this i've observed
[1:01:09] amen i took care of this
[1:01:11] amen and jesus said thy life is one
[1:01:14] thing right i wonder what it's going to
[1:01:16] be like brother mike when we get to the
[1:01:19] end
[1:01:20] and we see so many
[1:01:22] lacketh one thing
[1:01:25] god ain't gonna let you go in above his
[1:01:27] word
[1:01:29] god's not gonna amend faith favoritism
[1:01:32] to us right amen
[1:01:34] can i go on amen
[1:01:36] so the prophet of god says
[1:01:38] he said the rich young ruler
[1:01:40] as we call him in the bible he passed a
[1:01:44] great opportunity
[1:01:47] he passed a great opportunity
[1:01:50] amen amen why he was right at the foot
[1:01:53] of the cross
[1:01:54] he was right at the foot of christ
[1:01:57] he was right in the one that could give
[1:02:00] him life amen
[1:02:02] amen amen and i thought isn't it amazing
[1:02:06] that even jesus
[1:02:08] cannot amen change you
[1:02:10] amen
[1:02:12] if you break the word right that's true
[1:02:15] this word is so important
[1:02:17] amen right your bible tells you
[1:02:20] that heaven and earth will pass away
[1:02:22] but it's never his word never will
[1:02:25] amen amen and so therefore amen just
[1:02:29] reading this book
[1:02:31] it doesn't do it
[1:02:33] that's right it doesn't do it amen amen
[1:02:36] so it takes something
[1:02:38] as obedience yes
[1:02:40] to the word of god amen
[1:02:42] and you know we find out that the bible
[1:02:44] tells us
[1:02:45] in luke chapter 16 amen maybe the bible
[1:02:50] readers did not know this until the
[1:02:51] prophet come
[1:02:53] that this wrong man
[1:02:55] lifted up his eyes in hell right yes
[1:02:58] and he remembered
[1:03:00] right
[1:03:01] he remembered
[1:03:03] where he missed it
[1:03:05] brother madam says it like this
[1:03:08] he said herod is out in the regions of
[1:03:09] the lost
[1:03:11] remember
[1:03:13] when he missed it right
[1:03:20] amen god help us
[1:03:23] we can't just follow something
[1:03:25] we've got to be a part of something
[1:03:28] this word must mean more to you than
[1:03:31] your very necessary meat
[1:03:33] it's got to be you absolute
[1:03:36] that's the reason god rich in mercy has
[1:03:39] sent a message
[1:03:40] that you wouldn't miss
[1:03:42] it he's give every one of us
[1:03:45] he give he give the world an opportunity
[1:03:49] he traveled the world
[1:03:50] amen seven times right he amen gave the
[1:03:54] world an opportunity yes to receive god
[1:03:59] they thought they had god
[1:04:01] they thought they knew god
[1:04:03] they had observed all the laws
[1:04:06] amen
[1:04:07] that's the reason jesus said amen that
[1:04:10] day he said there's one accuses you
[1:04:13] i don't have to
[1:04:16] i don't have to accuse you
[1:04:17] there's one that you followed
[1:04:20] there's going to be one standing that
[1:04:22] day
[1:04:23] that's going to accuse us
[1:04:25] and that was the one that delivered this
[1:04:27] message amen are y'all helping me today
[1:04:31] don't you see my voice is bad
[1:04:37] praise the lord amen there's one
[1:04:41] that accuses you
[1:04:43] amen we've got to stand
[1:04:45] amen with that message of the hour
[1:04:48] i'm not giving a count for luther i'm
[1:04:51] not giving a count for wesley i'm not
[1:04:53] even giving an account for pentecost
[1:04:55] but i will give account what god has
[1:04:58] done in this hour
[1:05:00] can you say amen
[1:05:02] brother madam said
[1:05:04] this young man missed his opportunity
[1:05:08] he give it up
[1:05:10] and standing right in the presence
[1:05:13] i couldn't help but think in this hour
[1:05:15] amen how many people has walked out they
[1:05:18] get on youtube
[1:05:20] and they start expressing how wrong
[1:05:22] amen how wrong amen you got to be a part
[1:05:26] of something before you can say it's
[1:05:27] wrong
[1:05:29] [Music]
[1:05:31] are y'all with me amen
[1:05:33] amen they never was a part of it right
[1:05:36] amen it never was made real to him
[1:05:38] is that what the prophet said
[1:05:40] brother brown said it never was he said
[1:05:43] we have the bible we have the truths of
[1:05:45] it right but it was not made real
[1:05:48] the biggest part of the people
[1:05:51] you can follow something because it's
[1:05:52] good it seems right it looks right amen
[1:05:56] but when it comes right down to it you
[1:05:58] miss your opportunity
[1:06:02] and you say amen
[1:06:04] amen the prophet of god says
[1:06:07] amen so this young man
[1:06:09] was like the great rich layout of sia
[1:06:12] amen
[1:06:14] well what god did he sent a word in
[1:06:16] laodicea
[1:06:18] amen
[1:06:20] amen and you know what it was predicted
[1:06:22] to come and lay out a seal
[1:06:24] amen
[1:06:26] but the thing about it was they were so
[1:06:28] invested in the church entity
[1:06:31] they were so invested in their own
[1:06:33] creatures
[1:06:34] and they missed what god did
[1:06:37] amen and when it was presented to us
[1:06:40] chicago 1961
[1:06:42] look what brother battle looked hey man
[1:06:44] they had an opportunity we'll come
[1:06:47] we'll be baptized
[1:06:51] are y'all with me
[1:06:53] brother brother said that they come not
[1:06:55] a one right brother said they asked for
[1:06:57] their tapes did they get them not a one
[1:07:00] but they had an opportunity
[1:07:03] they had an opportunity
[1:07:05] think about a church
[1:07:07] amen here we stand
[1:07:09] amen tonight with an opportunity that a
[1:07:12] lot of the world don't have a lot of
[1:07:14] church people don't have
[1:07:16] but you got an opportunity why because
[1:07:18] the word of god has come right to you
[1:07:20] and has failed right at your feet and
[1:07:23] brother it's what you do with it it's
[1:07:25] your opportunity
[1:07:31] trying to help the young people
[1:07:33] you can't hardly help young people when
[1:07:34] the old people's falling away
[1:07:41] look at the old people falling away yeah
[1:07:43] why would a young person want something
[1:07:45] that the old people came out
[1:07:48] right
[1:07:49] is that all right yes
[1:07:51] richly out of seal
[1:07:53] they amen they're rich
[1:07:55] they have neither nothing
[1:07:57] but they don't know that they're blind
[1:08:00] blind to what truth
[1:08:03] my bible said you shall know the truth
[1:08:05] and the truth will make you free
[1:08:08] it don't just set you free it makes you
[1:08:10] free
[1:08:11] there's a difference in making you free
[1:08:12] and setting you free yes yes yes i've
[1:08:15] been made to longoria
[1:08:17] all right
[1:08:18] huh
[1:08:19] amen so you've been made free
[1:08:22] by the word of god

[1:26:15] i want to thank everybody for coming and
[1:26:17] participating and
[1:26:18] all the sisters for fixing food and
[1:26:21] all the
[1:26:22] brothers to come and brother jewel last
[1:26:24] night and bringing the word of god by
[1:26:26] the home of today
[1:26:29] i was when we brother homer was speaking
[1:26:32] yeah i'm going to talk for just a minute
[1:26:34] okay
[1:26:36] well the homer said i didn't shut up
[1:26:38] long enough is that this sandwich got
[1:26:39] cold last night
[1:26:42] so anyway
[1:26:44] but you know you think about moses
[1:26:47] as long as they got those hands as long
[1:26:49] as moses he got weary when he got older
[1:26:51] you know right
[1:26:52] right
[1:26:54] he'd let his hands down but you know who
[1:26:55] figured that out god didn't tell him
[1:26:57] that the young boys figured it out right
[1:26:59] that's right the young boys looked down
[1:27:00] at that battle and said hey when his
[1:27:02] arms go down
[1:27:05] we losing the battle right
[1:27:07] somebody get over there and grab that
[1:27:09] man's hands and raise him up
[1:27:11] he's getting weary he's getting toward
[1:27:13] the end of the journey he's getting you
[1:27:15] know he's he's he's one that we still
[1:27:16] look to right but he need a little bit
[1:27:19] of help right so i believe i believe
[1:27:21] that's what we should do as young as
[1:27:22] young men and in in the in the gospel
[1:27:26] they've listened
[1:27:28] my dad brother mike brother homer
[1:27:31] they've literally wore their self out
[1:27:34] bringing this gospel to the people of
[1:27:35] this nation
[1:27:36] and to the world literally wore their
[1:27:38] self out physically
[1:27:40] so we need to help them hold their hands
[1:27:42] up right hey man hold our hands up
[1:27:45] amen
[1:27:47] pray for him
[1:27:50] we all need prayer
[1:27:52] and pray for all of us young ones i
[1:27:53] appreciate the the the older ones that
[1:27:55] come through and you know
[1:27:58] they went through all those doctrines
[1:27:59] you know
[1:28:00] oh yeah all those false ones right
[1:28:04] to bring us a message
[1:28:06] a message of truth so that we don't have
[1:28:07] to fight through that same jungle they
[1:28:09] made a little bitty path
[1:28:11] that we can get through
[1:28:12] and make it to where this is as brother
[1:28:14] homer said this is your time this is
[1:28:16] your hour this is the time this is not
[1:28:18] luther not wesley not pentecost this is
[1:28:20] a message of the hour this is a
