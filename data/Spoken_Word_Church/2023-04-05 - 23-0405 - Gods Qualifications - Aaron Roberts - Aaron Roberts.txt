of the Lord looking forward to this weekend the services and everything so if you have your Bibles tonight let's just get ready to look into the scripture tonight we're going to Matthew chapter 9. and then just before we read the scripture let's just all bow our heads tonight and just all pray Heavenly Father we thank you for this day Lord we thank you for your blessings on us in order for another time to come in your house and we just pray that you just Lord just help us get ourselves out of the way Lord that you can have the preeminence in this service tonight Lord we come to see from and hear from you Lord and we're just insufficient in ourselves Lord but Lord we come to totally depend on you Lord that you just come and speak to us tonight father and Lord we just pray for each one that's not here Lord you know the different needs ones that are sick and Afflicted Lord and we just pray that you just be with them Lord each need Lord you know what the needs are what what the desires are and we just commit them to you Lord and Lord you just give us what we have need of today Lord just bless the bride around the world Lord and we just commit all things to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen Matthew chapter 9. begin at verse 10. there it is and scripture says and it came to pass as Jesus said it meet and the house behold many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples and when the Pharisees saw it they said unto his disciples why eateth your master Republicans and sinners but when Jesus heard that he said unto them they that behold need not a physician but they that are sick but ye go and learn what that meaneth and I will have mercy and not sacrifice for I am not come to call this righteous but Sinners to repentance amen God bless the reading of the word you may be seated and my my title tonight is called God's qualifications and this is a this is from the message what it takes to overcome all unbelief brother Brian says there's an old proverb that's more than a proverb no matter how who is there first you have to play the rules of the game or you'll never win if a runner is running around the track and one takes a shortcut and cuts through the field and beats the other one there by half hour still he will be disqualified at the end of the race he's got to play it according to the rules of the game or he's disqualified and he said that's the way we have to do the race of life that we're running now it has to be played according to God's qualifications or will lose when we get there whether we're president whether we are the governor or minister or who what church we belong to what denomination the rules of the game has to be kept we must run it fair we must play it by the rules we must preach the word we must do it willingly Paul said I believe in Hebrews the 12th chapter that saying we are compassionate about was such a great cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and to send the dust so he'll easily beset us that we might run with patience the race that set before us Paul was speaking in the Olympics and so forth that was in Greece and Rome so forth he know that you had to play that game fair if you did not you'd be disqualified and tonight as born-again Christians as Believers here at the end time we've got to play the game according to the rules we've got to run with patience the race has set before us looking to the author and finisher Jesus Christ and so I just want to look at a few things tonight and the definition of of qualification says equality accomplishment Etc that sits a person for some function office or the like a circumstance or condition required by law or custom forgetting having or exercising or right holding an offer or the like the act of qualifying the state of being qualified the word qualified the definition for that is to have a legal right to have or do something because of the situation you are in or to call someone to have such a right to achieve or to have the standard of skill knowledge or ability that is necessary for doing or being something or to call someone to reach that standard and so I just want to look at a few things tonight and there's several scriptures that I'll that I want to look at tonight but I when I was thinking this is the scripture that that came to mind is when the Pharisees were there and you know when Jesus came he came to minister the scripture said he said I'm not I've not come to be ministered to but he said I come to minister and you know he he because he knew what his role was what his what his calling was and when he when he began to deal with the people you know there was a there was a calling there was a longing in the people and you know he came to to reach out to the people and it was the people that heard him that had a long had a desire that he reached out to then they came and it says you know he came to sit and he said many publicans and sinners came to fellowship with him and you know and then here's he says the Pharisees came and they were like why why are y'all hanging out with the lowlifes and the no goods and you know all of these people but Jesus had an answer because you know he didn't go by what the Pharisees qualifications were see their qualifications were they had a certain standard like listen we're not going to hang around those people because they have a bad name but see when Jesus brought the word back to them because they were supposed to know the law and they were supposed to know who they were and what what the word was sent to do and he said this is what it was sent to do he said the physio he said the physician comes to those that are sick those that are whole those that are well he said they don't need a physician but he said the ones that are sick and needy he said they're the ones that come because they're the ones that I've reached out to and he said they are the ones that respond to the word they either respond to the call and he said he said but you said you go and learn what it means man why because he made it known what he was supposed to do because they had because they had such a high idea of what the Messiah was going to do but they didn't realize that he came to be a servant that he came to be the lowest of the low to reach the lowest of the low that he became he became what you and I were though we might become what he is so when he came then he came he stepped into this role then he said you need to learn and understand that he said then I will have mercy well because when you realize that you're not as high as you think you are because because you know you're not who you think you are because you realize that you're separated from God because when he when he began to explain to the scriptures to the Pharisees you know what they didn't have a place to stand when when the woman at the the woman that they brought that was in the act of adultery when they came and he began to write on the ground when he began to explain you know whatever it was that he began to write on the screen on the ground but whatever it was it was something that was a rebuke to them hey whatever it was but but I believe what it was to her no matter what it was to them to her it was Grace it was Grace applied to her so when it when it's because when all of a sudden all of her accusers are gone and he said where are your accusers well lord they're gone and he said well neither do I condemn you he said but go and sin no more so it was something that was given to her that was a real that was a blessing to her but you know he just didn't he just didn't whitewash everything but he told her not to do it anymore but but he brought her into a fellowship into a place listen this is what you need to do well because you know what he didn't have her under his foot he didn't cast your album why because he came to bring Sinners to repentance but you know what if you can't if you can't ever get to the place to realize that you're a sinner that you're lost that you need help you'll never get any help but that's why God wants us to see because the Pharisees couldn't see that well because they were so self-righteous in what they had that there was nothing to God it was actually a stink in his nostrils but he was but he wanted to reach out this is what they come to do and so it's not it's not what our qualifications are it's God's qualifications the whole Bible is based on God's qualifications not ours many times you know the problem is we need to see we need to see the way you see the things the way God sees them we need to see things the way God we need to see with God's eyes not our eyes you know many times we see you know how brother Brown was speaking there in in Ohio I believe it was where he was there and he went to that restaurant or whatever it was and he seen the police officer and that woman in that restaurant you know they were gambling and you know all the immoral things that they had done or whatever and you know he began he began to look at that woman and said Lord do my daughters have to be raised in a country that in a state that looks like that that's that's the condition the world is in that my daughters have to be raised in that and all he could do is condemn that woman and all of a sudden when when the Lord brought him back and said listen I want you to see who you are I wanted I want you to say your condition when he began to say the bumper blood that covered around the world when he realized he didn't have a place to stand he was he was without anything when he stood before God he was naked he didn't have anything it was only the by the grace of God to bump her blood that covered him that they covered him that made him righteous before God then all of a sudden when he saw they saw the condition realized that he didn't have a place to stand then all of a sudden he could go and Minister that woman and begin to speak to her about her condition and then all of a sudden he goes up there and apologized to her for for the condition and for his way of thinking about her when he began to con because what he could was condemning her hey there was no way that he could reach her there was no way he could help her but when he got to the place when he got to see her the way God saw her when he got Beyond his own self and he began to see that then he could help her then God could use him to help and it's the same way with you and I we have to use God's way of thinking God's qualifications not our own you know many scriptures in the Bible we can we can see through the scriptures and there was a couple of scriptures that you know I was thinking about reading but I just want to read a quote a little bit from them but the other one that come to mind was the Rich Young Ruler you know when the Rich Young Ruler come to Jesus and you know he's a good Master you know what do I need to inherit eternal life well you know the good thing is is this young young man he had a lot of things going for you but the one thing he realized what he needed he come to ask the man who had it what he needed amen amen but the problem was when Jesus began to speak to him and Jesus in the scripture says that Jesus loved him and he had a lot of good things going for him he was he was moving in the right direction but you know what many times people want to hear that they want to know the truth but when you tell them the truth they don't want to hear it they only think they want to know the truth you know many times people you know they I I've had I've had times even brother Brandon was talking about when he was in Mexico when that reporter come to him and asked him you know what you believe about the Catholic church and he's like I wish you would ask me that but I'll tell you what you if you wanted me to tell you I'll tell you what I think you know and people people coming they'll ask you you know what what do you think about women preachers or what do you think about this the way you think about that it's like well do you really want to know because you know if you want to know what the scripture says and it's not my idea but I'm going to tell you what God qualifies I'm going to tell you what the word says it ain't my idea and it ain't it ain't me trying to pick a fight with you but I'm gonna tell you what the Bible says then the fight is not the argument is not with me it's with what the Bible says but when he told them you know what you think about the Catholic church he said it's the highest form of spiritualism there was well if you don't want to know don't ask so when you begin to ask these questions you know you may not want you may not want the answer sometimes people say you know they want to come and they want to get help from the preacher you know they want they want counseling or they want everything well sometimes when they come they don't want the answer no no because all they want you to do is pet them you know they want you to you they want you to just Pat them on the back tell them they're okay well sometimes you can't tell them that sometimes a word that comes is going to be cutting it's going to be hard to swallow it's going to be difficult why because that's what the word does the word is corrective but it's love but people don't want that and so when the Rich Young Ruler came before Jesus and he asked him what do I need to be to to receive eternal life what do I need and he begins to tell what you know all the all the Commandments that he done well I've already done all those things and he had such a great life but when Jesus began to look at his life and tell him exactly what he had to do you know what your hold up is young man you got a problem with money you want to serve God but you know what your money is your god that's your hindrance but you know the thing is just like brother Brandon said how do you how do you get overcome all those problems he said do the vice versa just get rid of it and that's what Jesus told him listen you got a problem with money here get give it all to the poor but you know what he don't listen this is the plan I've got a plan for you it's an investment you're going to invest invest all your worldly Goods into the poor and you come follow me because you're making an investment in me and he said you'll have Treasures in Heaven that you're gonna that you're investing in something that all of a sudden you're going to get greater reaches than what you'll have well but you know he couldn't he couldn't understand that financial report because all of a sudden he says it says the scripture says that he was very sorrowful when he heard that because he had great possessions that Jesus said on his disciples barely I say unto you that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven he said again I say it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle therefore a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God when his disciples heard it they were exceedingly amazed saying who then can be saved but Jesus beheld them and said unto them with man this is impossible but With God all things are possible so when he began to look at this situation man's qualifications don't work but God has a way to qualify you for this but you've got to follow the plan and so when it when it came this is the way that you do this because God knows exactly where each one of us are and he knows that what each one of us have need of but the problem is is when God begins to speak to us about it are we going to accept the plan are we going to be qualified because you know there's there's many different qualifications that we've got to look at but you know what God calls a man they don't not only he qualifies the man and he equips them in we'll read here in a minute but you see God makes the qualifications we don't many times in situations in our lives the problem is is we want to do things the way we want to do them we want to look at it the way we want to look at it and the problem is is we look at it the wrong way that's right because we're not looking at the way God's looking at it own there was a man in the Bible that had that same problem and his name was Saul and Saul had Saul had an issue because his problem was when God when Samuel told him what to do and how to do it he didn't follow the plan because a Saul got in it in his mind that he was qualified to make those decisions but it wasn't but it wasn't his it wasn't his qualification like those decisions because God had a man Samuel to give him the qualifications of what he was supposed to do because he was he was God's prophet and the word come to the prophet and Samuel told him what to do and he told him he said when you go to Hamlet he said you utterly destroyed it you don't take nothing there you leave it you burn it get rid of it it's built and it's it's not free for you to have it but you know when when he came you know he took all the he done exactly what the people wanted to do well you know we think because I'm qualified to make this decision I'm qualified to say that we're going to take the best of everything and he tells Samuel that we're going to offer this unto the Lord well you know we don't know if that's going to really be the case or not because you know what some of those nice sheep and cattle and everything may end up in somebody's Barn some some of these fine animals some of the some of this fine gold some of these fine garments may end up somebody's closet but he goes out there and he tells us but he's telling Samuel oh praise the Lord we've done the work of the Lord we've followed What did what was told of us we've done what was required of us and then when he began to tell you he said what is what is this lowing that I hear why why are these people here we these are not Israelites and why why are we hearing all these these animals and and and souls oh we've done the we've done the work of the Lord praise the Lord we've done it and he said no you have not as Samuel says and and uh chapter first Samuel 15 verse 22 says he said and Samuel said have God has the Lord as great delight and burnt offerings and sacrifice as in obeying the voice of the Lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of Rams for as Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry because thou Hast rejected the word of the Lord he hath rejected thee from being King so when when he rejected the word of the Lord then because he was not qualified to make that distinction because he did not follow the word of the Lord then God told him said listen you're not qualified to be king anymore you're done away with and he said he said a Saul said unto the same I have sinned for I have transgressed the Commandment of the Lord now that was that was twice that Samuel had to tell Saul that he was wrong before he actually actually believed it he stood in the prophet's face and honestly told him that uh we've done it we followed the Lord we did but when when Samuel had to get real with him and had to stand in his face and tell him listen God has rejected you he said he said because he said I've transgressed the command of the Lord and thy words because I feared the people and obeyed their voice and so he continued therefore I pray thee pardon my sin and turn again with me that I may Worship the Lord and Samuel said unto Saul I will not return with thee for thou Hast rejected the word of the Lord and the Lord hath rejected thee from being King over Israel hey obeyed the voice and when when Saul begins to Samuel begins to tell him he's like you know when you were little in your own sight when you didn't think of much of yourself God thought enough of you to make you King but you've gotten to the place now where I it's not following the the Lord he said I feared the people I was more worried about what the people thought than what God thought I'm thinking more what they're doing and then when when Samuel rebukes him then he says oh Samuel will you turn and Worship the Lord with me because because he didn't want people to realize that God had rejected him Samuel will you come and put on just just put on this little show for other people to show everybody it's okay it's going to be okay and he's like no I'm turning away from you you've rejected the Lord and I'm turning away from you you've been rejected and as Samuel turned away to go away turned about to go away he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle and it rent and Samuel said unto him the Lord hath rent the Kingdom of Israel from thee this day and hath given it to a neighbor of thine that is better than thou so I already had somebody but because of what he had done he had been rejected and he was turned away because God had given him what he was supposed to do and he rejected it and God rejected him and you know it was it was a heartbreaking thing for Samuel to have to do that because in the next chapter we you know he said he never saw Samuel never Samuel never saw Saul again when he walked away from me he turned his back on him and never went to see him again and you know it was a heartbreaking thing to do that because the scripture tells us in in chapter 16 and it says and the Lord said unto Samuel how long well thou mourn for Saul saying I've rejected him from reigning over Israel he said fill thine horn with all and to go and I will send thee to Jesse the bethlehemite for I have provided me a king among his sons now this is this is an interesting passage of scripture because when you know Samuel is as re you know because he's God's rejected Saul and he tells him said listen he said now I've got a king I've got somebody in mind I want him to be king and I want you to go anoint him and being and being the prophet of God the first thing Samuel's like uh I don't want to have to go against him and he's like well God tells me listen you just go down there and tell him you're gonna sacrifice because he didn't want he didn't want to get in the hour of the king but he sent him down there and said listen you just go down there and when he goes down there the escape the scripture says it go down to sacrifice and he said and called Jesse in verse 3 says and call Jesse to the sacrifice and I will show thee what Thou shalt do and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee and Samuel said after which the Lord spake and came to Bethlehem and the Elders of the Town trembled at his coming and saying cometh thou peaceably and he said peaceably I am come to sacrifice unto the Lord sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice and he Sanctified Jesse and his sons and called them to the sacrifice now what's interesting about that is when you he said he called them to the sacrifice but when you see when he goes to anoint eliab God said that's not the one that I because he was the oldest and God says I rejected him but the Lord said in verse 7 said but the Lord said unto Samuel look not on his countenance nor on the height of his stature because I have refused him but the Lord seeketh not as man seeketh for the Lord looketh on the man looketh on the outward appearance but the Lord looketh on the heart and he continues to call the men the sons and he kept rejecting them now the verse before that says that he called Samuel called all the sons of Jesse to the sacrifice and they were supposed to sanctify but sudden they get down to verse 11 and Samuel says unto Jesse or hear all thy children well if he called all the children why why wasn't David already there he should all because if he said all your children all your sons well you know what David should have been there well you know what he was he was the least in the Kingdom at least in the family and he was the one that gets overlooked because he was he was the one that was out of out of the area you know he was not there he said or hear all thy children they said they're remaineth yet the youngest and behold he put the Sheep we just we got him doing something because we don't want him under our feet he gets in our way and Samuel said unto Jesse sin and fetch him for we will not sit down till he come hither and he sent and brought him in and he but he now he was ready and with all of a beautiful countenance and goodly to look to and the Lord said arise anoint him for this is he and Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his Brethren the spirit of the Lord came unto David from that day forward and verse 14 says but the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him but it was interesting that God was looking at the man on the on the inward part of a man but you know when they called even his own family didn't think too much of him but God knew what kind of man David was that God would call him when nobody else talked too much of him God knew what kind of man he was looking for a man after his own heart and so you know we don't we don't have the we don't have the qualifications but God knows has the qualifications he knows what he's looking for and God brings a man in and he gives him the qualifications now this is from the message of total deliverance and and brother Brandon was speaking of Moses he said and Moses when he was called by God he was a he was a total complete prophet and when God sends a man to do anything he completely equips him with everything that he has need of if God calls a man to pee a preacher he put something in him to preach with if he calls him to be a teacher he put something in him to teach with if he calls for him to be a prophet he put something in him to see visions and be a prophet God always completely equips his man and that's just what he done when he sent Moses into Egypt he raised him up in a certain way and he schooled him in a certain way and he molded him and made him and fashioned him so when he called Moses all the things that Moses had to go through you know many times when people they when they have a failure just like Moses when Moses was was pulled out of the out of the Nile by Pharaoh's daughter and was raised up in Pharaoh's house and he become this great man and he had this great understanding and great learning and it was this great man but when he become to try to do what what he was called to do what his mother told him that he was supposed to do was supposed to be the deliverer of God's people when he kept when he realized when his mother told him he said you're not the son of Pharaoh's daughter but you're the deliverer because we've prayed your father and I prayed for a deliverer because we were we were there when the taskmasters we've seen people die because of the Egyptians but God sent a deliverer and it's you God give you the calling amen he called you to do this amen but when he come to the place he didn't follow God's plan he didn't do it in God's leading he didn't do it in God's time but he thought he could do it in his own self because he was so trained he was he was so smart he was so intelligent he thought he could work this thing he thought he could he could make a plan and make it happen but the problem was he all he done was cause a bunch of fighting and turmoil amongst all the all the Israel the children of Israel and had a day of Egyptian but you know then all of a sudden when all that happened there's people when when people have faults and failures and problems you know there's a lot of people you know they wouldn't have anything to do with Moses but you know why because you're an utter you're an utter failure you've made a big mess out of this and so we wouldn't touch you with a 10-foot Pole but you know what when God brought him all through that and put him on the back side of the desert for another 40 years to beat all of the all of the stuff of Egypt out of him all of his learning and everything when he beat all that out of him and 80 years of leaving God got into the place that he wanted him to be right and it wasn't and it wasn't what man thought of Moses's qualifications it's what God thought of God of Moses qualifications because God was the one that qualified him to be that and he and he made him and the way that he wanted him to be so he brought him to that place and when he went down there that he was in the place that he could be the deliverer why because it never changed what his calling was it just got him to the place that he could do it well because he got to the place where he could listen and follow the instructions of the Lord because God had to have because he had to have a one-on-one experience with God to come to the place that he could do that and when he got to the place where he could where he could come to and have an experience then God could use it many times that's what our problem is is we we don't lean to that you know we leaned our own understanding [Music] brother Brown continues on here he says then just like you if you're a Christian God Don't Make Any halfway Christians God makes complete Christians he said God Don't Make halfway preachers but the preacher can be halfway and God makes his children Christians but sometimes they're halfway Christians but it's not God's intention for them to be that way it's their own ways God mixed up with the plan of God for their life and that's what makes them the way they are God don't want them to be halfway Christians or halfway preachers compromising on each side hey he won't or he wants them to be completely stand in the breach them to completely stand in the breach and he said see Moses God made him a complete Prophet for a complete deliverance and Moses was completely surrendered into the hands of God that's the reason it made him what he was he was so complete in God till God could trust him he come to the place one because he went through those things because of what he had been through in his life it brought him to the place that God could trust him but he could yield himself to God brother Brown says continuing on he said I wonder this morning as Christians if we have yielded our own will and yielded ourselves completely to God till God can trust us the place that he has put us why because we want to be used of God well if God has put us in there but have we yielded ourselves to that we can be halfway Christians but if we can steal Christians but are we just halfway are we just three quarters because you know like the old song is you know we're looking for a hundred because 99 and a half won't do because if there's any part of us that has no yielded ourselves to God then you know what God is not looking for that because you know what you can be 99 yielded to God and be a hundred percent failure because God wants us to be totally absolutely yielded to him we don't have we don't have a thought coming we don't have an idea coming it's What God Says let us yield ourselves to him and see have we give that God can trust us in the place he's put us he said The Minister's got a place of Duty to stand and preach the unsearchable riches of Christ without compromising if he's called to be a preacher he won't he won't spare one thing for one person if he's called to be a preacher man why because you know it's it's not all fun and games well because everybody you know people are like well you know preachers want to want to you know turn a blind eye to this or or their family or whatever no you've got you've got to have it's got to be even it's got to be because what's good for one is good for all that's right you can't you can't just turn a blind eye to this one and that one it's always got to be and you know what it's not it's not always fun but you know what it's it's the word of God but you know that's that's the one thing that most people are always going to see you know it's always gonna be well brother Wade said this to me but you know such and such got by with it or they but you know what you never see the other side of the coin you never see the other side of the situation because well you know brother Dale may handle one situation a certain way and another another thing comes up and he handles it a different way and people what why is it why is that why was it this way and why was it that way why because God knows what he's doing amen many times we don't know we don't know what God has told somebody why is it because you know it's just like in the scripture when people like well why is this this way why is that way I said well why is it that when God says not to make any Graven image but then he turns around to tell Moses to raise up a Brazen serpent for healing why because you've got to know God is Sovereign and God's going to handle it a certain way yeah yeah amen because many times people get upset with things and it's like well I don't like this and I don't like that but the problem is is we've not sat down and prayed and found out what God says about it and so instead of opening our mouth and saying things before we actually pray about it and think what we're going to say you know when God Called Moses to be the deliverer when God called him to do a work then you know what there was no place no matter what went on what went on you know what Miriam and Aaron had no place to stand up and criticize Moses no matter no matter it was their their brother that they that they were saying that about it was still God's prophet and still God had had stand and rejected that and had and had to rebuke that and they had to be judged for it and sometimes you know why because we're so quick to say things and not realize what we're saying why because there's power in your words by your words you'll be justified by your words you'll be condemned but you've got to be careful by what you say amen and so many times you know I I just want I don't want to hold my peace or hold my tongue I may think things but you know the thing is Lord let me pray about it before I say anything because many times we don't know what's going on and so when it's not when it's not our place and we've got to be careful what we say that's reason it's so important that we pray and you pray for the leadership of this church well I'll tell you something it's not I don't I don't know about y'all but I'm gonna tell you this but I don't believe there's anybody in this church that's up here that's got a position that's doing this because you know they they want to have somebody looking at them and it's they're doing it on their own I believe I believe the I believe the ministry in this church is Led of God and whether we like it or not whether we agree with them or not whether they hurt our feelings or not I still believe it's a god-cold Ministry and so and sometimes you know we let things get out of hand so that's the reason it's so important to be careful about what we say because you know what it's not it's not our qualifications for these things it's God's qualifications because God lays down the law and God gives gives the word and so whatever takes place we've got to be careful about it it can be dangerous but that's what the devil wants us to do because the devil's always got to find some way he's got he's got to have his punch at you hey Jay they're gonna get to you or he's gonna get to the ministry he's gonna get to your family well somehow he's got something that he's always going to stir the turmoil there's always there's always got to be some way he's going to get to you you know you know it was it was said one time and talking about talking about being a minister you know it's like you know they talk about us being moody and you know we we get bad attitudes and and different things and it's like well I don't I don't know if we do or not I mean I just know that you know if you ever try to study or or pray or something like that you know don't worry about it you know they won't say nothing to you all day long but as soon as you start to pray study then you know everything goes wrong and everybody wants to talk to you and you know it's it's always there's always something that goes on why because that's God you know because that's when God wants to speak to you the devil's going to hinder it hey what was it the message recognizing your day and its message and brother Brandon was talking about trying to he said he felt like the Lord was trying to talk to him and he said everything he done he said the food that he ate didn't settle with him and he said you know every time he said I was in the basement he said I was trying to pray I was trying to read he said I end up falling asleep he said it was just like I was the Lord was trying to talk to him he said everywhere I'd go he said I was trying to get there I was trying to hear from the Lord and he said it was just like the devil kept trying to hinder him the whole time but he said it felt like the Lord was trying to get to him he said the more he just but he had to keep pressing he had to keep pressing forward to get to get to the place that the Lord could speak to him you know Isaiah was saying is you know there's a blessing in the pressing so you got to keep pressing and so you know maybe maybe we are that you know maybe preachers are that way I don't know but you know I mean but that's that's the thing you've got to overcome that because you know that's just everyday life that's just that's and you know everybody's made different as brother random said you know when we get these things it's just the human grab bag you know we just have these things that come everybody's different everybody's personality is different there's different things that that you have to deal with but all these things that would come our way but you know we just keep pressing and you know whatever it is God's trying to reach us but the devil's always going to try to hinder that but we just keep pressing that battle see now this is from the the Mighty God unveiled and he Brethren's talking about he said in the Old Testament Genesis 1 in the beginning God it's about it's a self-existing one the Elohim said the difference in the word and it continues on about being self-existent and said we can't be that he said so God in the beginning was life the Eternal one he said in him was attributes and those attributes became words and the word became flesh Jesus was the Redeemer and to redeem means to bring back if he has to bring it back he had to be somewhere to be about back too so you see all people will never be able to see it because all people wasn't in the beginning and God's thoughts he said look at the priest he said when they see him Express himself exactly with the word what he said was they said it's Beelzebub they showed where they their nature was he said it was in the modern thought of the day but when the little prostitute when he met at that gate and told her expressed his Messiah signed by telling her what she had done he said why she said sir I perceive that you are a prophet we know the Messiah when he comes he will tell us all these things she was recognizing him as the Messiah the anointed one because he met the scripture qualifications don't you say the congregation says amen the two pieces of paper that were coming together she said we know that when the Messiah cometh so when he when she began to see these things as he was talking about they tie together they see because the the when Jesus came in he began to minister the the Pharisees didn't agree with him they didn't see these things but you know what it wasn't for them to see it because when he was when he was at Elohim when he was self-existing he had those attributes inside of him and it didn't matter where they came or where they were at the attribute of God is always going to be displayed it was coming to the place that God called it to and so here's this woman you know nobody nobody thought anything of her hey you know who who would have thought that she was the seed of God who would have thought that she was the one but here she's the one that come and when when they saw the same when she saw the same thing that the Pharisees saw then they called it the elzebub and they said that you're just you're just Anointed with the devil but when she saw it she saw that the scriptures had come alive when it began she saw the scriptures being manifested in front of her and said sir I perceive you to be a prophet because that's what the scripture says that would be done and you know what not only did she not see that she was he she saw a prophet but in the world greater Revelation that came to her through Jesus was when she said when the Messiah comes he'll do these things and he identified himself in the scripture too a lot of people thought well Jesus was just a prophet but they didn't see that he was the Messiah but she saw who he was why because when she received the word and she saw that God was working there that there had to be the hand of God that was working and when she saw that then said we know that when the Messiah comes he's going to do these things we're looking for the Messiah when we say God on the saying and working we know that's when the Messiah is coming one day we don't know when he's coming but we're looking for him and what a great thing was when she was looking for the Messiah she stood in front of the Messiah and he identified himself to her she began to see who he was right Brethren says and to see now God might have had to interpret this to that he said to get this certain Ting of the Bell like the motor when when Jesus turned he said I am he that speaks unto you there was no such an expression as Beelzebub she left her water part and ran into the City and said come see a man who told me the things that I have done isn't this the very Messiah see he said now what what did this putting the old scripture with the experience that Jesus was giving her what did it do it made the Messiah and did you notice quickly her sins were forgiven because at the beginning she was redeemable because she was in God's thinking at the beginning so it redeemed her brought her back when she seen the express scripture manifested of Jehovah what he was and what he is so when it became to the place that she began to see why because she was looking for something and when it was manifested in front of her she received it but because it was for her it was a fur her day and it was for a hard time it was hard time to receive it man it's the same way with you and our brothers and sisters Now's the Time to receive the word the word is made manifest now see many times people they missed what was what's been going on the movement of the Lord seeing the things that was taking place you know they they missed these things because they just it gloss over it or they don't catch it because they don't see what's taking place but you're hearing and once more Lord brother Adam speaking and he's talking about 1933. see Catching the things that's taking place and seeing what's what's been going on and what he says there and he talks about the morning that the the Holy Spirit Come and told him the seven things that was going to take place you know while the visions that he had was talking about what was going to take place now you know whether whether you believe this or not I believe it I believe it's thus saith the Lord now everybody else can spend the rest of their life trying to tear it down and say well listen it didn't really happen and and this or that well you know what y'all can you know they can do that or whoever you know whatever that's fine but you're to me it's life to me it's truth I believe these Saints took place amen when he began to talk about that and even brother Adam said you know he said he had those papers and he wrote them and he said people's come to the church and actually read what what he wrote what he prophesied in the church and you know people that were actually there that actually heard him say these things whether whether they believe that or not you know that's up to them but I'm just I'm just one that believes it's the truth I I just that's just me you know but when he talks about all these things taking place and he said you know they would elect the wrong president and uh right before the right before you get to the highlighted portion there he said and they said and this this would be a woman stand up and it would govern the United States not actually a woman but a church then we see her with nothing but ashes it's going to happen you know you say the the condition that the world is in and whether whether you believe it or not this this is this is for this is prophesied what's going to take place he said five of those things has perfectly been fulfilled exactly how Mussolini would rise and go to Ethiopia and fall at its steps and he would be turned to the people in shame with a woman many many years before it actually before it happened perfectly on the dot it's never failed and it won't fail because it's thus saith the Lord and it's not contrary to these Bible it's got to be so the things that people you know when that what people know about is it actually in the scripture are we actually looking at things that are in the scripture well you know you know there's a lot of things that you have to realize that when a prophet speaks it speaks according to the scripture why because if he's Vindicated according to the scripture then what he says is truth that he's speaking the truth but what's so amazing is well the one thing that brother Ram said that even the Bible tells us about the way that you can tell a prophet is right was when he says these things if it comes to pass so we know these things but you know the thing is is what happened what's your experience what God has spoke to you that's whether you can tell if it's true or not he continues on here and he's speaking of the organizations and everything and he says and she is making love to her daughters willing them right back again he said with no spiritual understanding stripped it's an oasis for her why because if you don't see the condition that the world is in oh it looks so wonderful see the condition they say oh it's what a grand thing it is oh my and Pentecostal men sitting in the council at Rome and sending letters around and said is it it was the most spiritual time they've ever seen How could a born-again man cut off his secret cut off the word and they live by a Creed that's exactly what Delilah has done today cutting off the word and you live by the creek when when brother Branham was standing there and telling them listen you can't follow into that old denomination because you were called out of it because he said come out and harm my people and touch not the unclean thing and when he began to identify the spirit of the age of what was going to take place and you can't mess with the denominations because there's a spirit on that and it's a spirit of antichrist and he's calling them back and he's calling the people back to the word and brother random standing there telling him what the scripture is and identifying the day and age in which we live and he kept telling them and yet they go right back to that why because they get under a spirit and an anointing well you can be anointed and have false words you can you can believe a lie and be anointed of the Holy Spirit oh what a wonderful thing but not realized yet and he said but they realized they were being cut off the word was being cut off from them just like Samson when he went in there and he laid in the lap of Delilah and had his had his Covenant cut off they the Pentecostals had the exact same thing because they thought they were qualified they thought they had the spiritual understanding when they stood there in the days of a prophet and he began to explain to them where they were at and understand they were devoid of the scripture they devoted the word just because you're anointed because the Holy Spirit falls on you whatever you say whatever happens is right and that's how that's how the devil could deceive the people brother Brown said the scripture says that that they would believe a lie and be damned by it why because they're following the anointing and not following the word it's not just by having anointing it's what the word says he said now look he said look at the defeat today he said from what it would be ministers instead of god-called Ministers of our Pinnacle Pentecostal group he said they had you have to have a doctorate degree before you get in the pulpit he said you got to have a fellowship card he said now in our great denomination of Pentecost before you send us send a missionary they got to send him before a psychiatrist see if he can stand the mental test he said he said see now that's right he said I wouldn't say that unless I could back it up see tell me if that's the qualification of a minister see God God didn't need some man to come up with some idea of what would take place well we we've got we've gotta we've got to have something to do with this no God started the church the way he wanted it and he kept the same way and if he qualified one man to lead and preach then guess what he kept them all the same yeah then you know what then they didn't have to have some kind of qualifications he said the Bible they never went before any psychiatrist but they waited in the city of Jerusalem until they were filled with power from on high hey some of them could not even write their name a few days later one passed through the gate called beautiful and he never seen them never been before a psychiatrist he never had his Fellowship card and he said such as I have I have never seen a fellowship card produce that why because they got to have their own ideas of how things ought to operate and not realizing that's totally opposite of what the word says He said what always he said we are stripped embarrassed in the presence of the Holy Ghost it certainly fulfills what the prophet said in second Timothy three it'd be heady High Mighty lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God well because they're totally stripped embarrassed in front of the Holy Ghost why because when the truth began to be known you know what it was when brother Branham was stood up and he began to speak to the to the Pentecostals and he began to tell him listen he said I'm not he said I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision and he began to talk about the same the same uh Ministry that Paul had and he began to talk about the things that meant that Paul went through and Paul was rejected by men and he rejected the the leaders of his day rejected solidly rejected his ministry and what he preached and he said listen it's the same way today the word has been made May restored in our day and he said it was totally rejected by man it was totally rejected by by the denominations and let me tell you something it's not just out there looking all these different places but let me tell you it's the same Spirit of the enemy today and he just changes he might change his dwelling place but let me tell you it's the same spirit and it's still as the word Goes Forth as the word as a bride goes continues on then guess what the spirit of the enemy the spirit that's going to continue to battle her is not going to be out there in the denominations it's going to be right around this message it's going to be right there standing because there's still going to be a mixed multitude that's going to stand in the way this is from God changed does God change his mind he said but I want you to say this in closing he said God never changed his mind now the Bible said Jesus Christ is saying yesterday today and forever now that don't mean in a certain way that means he's the same yesterday today and forever Jesus said in John 14 12 he that believeth on May the works that I do shall he do also is that right he promised in Mark 16 these shine shall follow them that believe he said no well that was just for the impossible he said go ye in all the world and preach the gospel to every creature these signs shall follow them all in all the world to every creature in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues if they take up servants or drink deadly things it won't harm them if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover he said now that's his qualification see when he try to qualify something we are trying to make qualify the church to what we think God's word is we can't qualify the church we've got to qualify to God we got to qualify to What God Says say God is God is the one that lays down the qualifications but the other thing is is that we actually have if we believe what God is saying what the qualifications are that you know what we still have the power to do the same thing that we still have the power that we still have the authority that it's still in in a force tonight and it's no matter where you think you are or who you are if you're a believer in the word even even the most lowest simplest person the least in the Kingdom still has the authority to and the still right to do that then you have the right to claim your god-given inheritance God has called us to that this is from the Smyrna Church age brother man says tongues he said tongues he said it's time to get back to God he said they have a name that they live but they are dead he said tongues this is the evidence of a Revival he said it's the evidence of death he said tanks proclaimed the evidence that the ceremonial religion of the Jews was over that a new era had begun tongues today is ringing down the curtain on the Gentile Church Aegis and the gospel is going back to the Jews people are talking about tongues heralding in a great spiritual move they have missed the boat the truth is that it is the writing the Finish to all of man's ideas programs and kingdoms and the kingdom of God is being ushered in and wake up people of God wake up [Music] continuing on here he says he said if you don't think this is true just listen to this he said all over the world in both Pentecostal and fundamental groups they are organizing the businessmen they have invaded the pulpit without a call from God they have styled themselves the Fishers of Men and the founders of a move of God and they say the gifted Ministry of Ephesians 4 10-13 that God gave the church has failed and they are taking over here we are right in the midst of the Fulfillment of Prophecy called The Gang sayings of Korah and they don't even know that they have fulfilled it they are blindly going on preaching experience for truth may God have pity on them may their eyes be open before it's too late so when you begin to see here he's talking about this great movement of God the Pentecostals oh well this is the great move of God here's the tongues that's going to take place and not realizing according to scripture when brother random said this is Judgment falling because now is the ending of the Gentile dispensation and it's now going back to the Jews and not realizing now is the end of the time when this was to take place and he began why because there had to be a prophet and listening to express this to tell the people what was going to take place and all this is a great move of God no the scripture tells us that when when uh in there in the scripture and have a good answer in them when they saw that they said you've been well found wait in the balance and found Walton when that when the scripture came down in the beginning they had and Daniel had to uh trans translate that interpret what was saying and realize that they were under judgment hey brother I said that was the end of the Gentiles and so when and now we've reached the end of the Gentiles and now it's going back to the Jews the head of the Jews so now the word is going back to the Jews it's the end of the Gentiles and he begins to talk about what does it take place and people not realizing what's taking place and when he when he stands here and he says see people are looking at these things and not realizing but that's what was to take place there was a there was a falling away from the scriptures because he said the that in the end time that he would fulfill the word but that would be a falling away that they're turning away from the scripture why because they they think they've got the truth and they don't and here they are he says they have turned away from this from the real true five-fold Ministry Amen brother I've said this there was a gifted Ministry of Ephesians 4. and what that's what struck me the other day when I was reading that he said that that God gave the church they've got to the place where they think the fivefold ministry God gave these he gave those gifts into the end of the body and these people have think they've qualified they're qualified to stand up and say this gifted Ministry of Ephesians 4 is failed and they've got they've got their own people that are raising up he was talking about the the the Full Gospel business man and brother Brown's standing there and tell him listen you are not called to be in the in the ministry you're not called to be in the pulpit but see then it's the same Spirit that's here today it's the exact same Spirit why because if if they stood back there and said the faithful Ministry it's not it's not any good it has fallen it has failed then guess what it's the same Spirit that's here today we don't have to have a faithful Ministry and he does anymore today why because it has failed and so all of a sudden it's the same spirit and it says they're raising up to take over which is exactly the same thing that we see today we don't need a five-fold Ministry why because we have the prophet we're just going to push play we're just going to hear what the prophet had to say well you know what that doesn't that does totally away with the with the word of God why because God was the one that called and started the the thoughtful Ministry and you don't you're not I don't care who you are you're not qualified to take them out say God put the gifts in the body and you're not we're not qualified to take them out but God is the one that controls all that see we see the same thing as it was with the gang saying of Cora oh we're we're just we're just knowing it as y'all are we've got the understanding God speaks to us too I wouldn't trust it no further than I could throw it but say that's the whole problem people got to the place where they don't even realize that it takes God to qualify somebody that's anointed of God God does the calling God does anointing God does the equipping so you brother babe says here in in the Patmos Vision he says he said you can't do any good until first you get in the spirit he said God can't use you he said he said all our all your efforts are in vain until you first get in the spirit he said if I sing I will sing in the spirit of I pray said Paul I spur I pray in the spirit then if there is anything that comes to me that's any good it's got to be revealed to me by the spirit and confirmed by the word made manifest by the results it bears say it's got to come by the word not just not just some kind of uh thought or idea but it's got to line up with the entire word it's got a dovetail with everything he said like in other words if I say Jesus Christ promising his word he said that if I would repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ he said I will receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the first thing for me to do is to repent he said be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ if I I shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost first thing for me to do is repent is revealed to me that that's true then be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ then the result says I'll receive the Holy Ghost he promised that if I would believe and have the Elders of the church anoint me with all pray over me in the prayer face shall save the sick he said Lord I believe yeah he said I follow your instructions then he continues on see we've got he said when God says anything it has to take place so when you meet God's qualifications just remember God will himself manifest himself and take care of it you just go ahead it's a finished work oh isn't that wonderful oh my just think God said you do this and I'll do this well if I go do this he's got to do that so then you've got to take him out his word and follow what he said but he spoke it then you've got to have it and believe it and it's got to be quick unto you by the scripture so if you believe that then if you've received the Holy Ghost if you've received a New Birth by following what the scripture says if you follow through that when you receive it then it will the scripture says that he will lead you and guide you into all truth now when he begins to lead you and begins to express these things to you the scripture says that in Acts 1 8 he said he said but ye shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria into the uttermost part of the Earth and then and this is from the message Witnesses he said now to be an witness he said witness must be first qualified in the courts of our land and Supreme Court they talk about being a you got to be examined before you can be a witness he said you got to stand by examination he said if you've got to do that he said how much more will the god of Heaven require an examination and a qualified witness before we are recognized in his sight as a correct Witness so he gave his commission to the disciples or the 120 that they should wait at Jerusalem until they are qualified to be Witnesses see that was a search specification that we must meet before we are qualified as a witness and this witness was to be this qualification was to be the coming of the promised Holy Spirit to fill the church with unction and the word unction comes from the Greek word Dynamite which means an explosion he must be something they must receive something before they can be a witness he said God never sends a man until first he has made him a qualified Witness so that we have to he said Lord somebody said somebody said they throw your case out you've got to be a right Witness you've got to have you've got to have seen something or heard something you got to know something they're not gonna have any hearsay you've got to know what you're talking about he said any turn any attorney knows that you cannot be a witness unless you have seen it for yourself not what somebody else said you have seen it and hear it either hear or see or hear before you can be a witness so you've gotta know and so when he calls you to be a witness it's it's for a real experience to you when you've received that that Holy Spirit when you when you've been brought in and you've been birthed into the body then you become a witness to know these things to be a witness why because when you stand up then your life becomes a witness to people then it's not just not just some idea but it's the truth what the scripture says becomes a manifestation in your life he said because when these things come then he said it would be a manifestation and the results will be the manifestation of the word so that's what our that's what our job is that's what our goal is for us to manifest these things you know what God Said and what God wants done with the word for us to understand who we are what God has called us to to realize God has qualified you to these things because you know if he's if he's pleased with you then that he gave you the Holy Ghost if he'd come up if he came to live inside of you if you come to take up residence in you to live through you to manifest himself to the world through you for you to be an overcomer it's not because Paul said it's no longer I that lived now but he said Christ that lives in me so you know what it's not me overcoming but it's him through me overcoming I can't overcome these things but it's him through me can overcome that I could realize that through him I'm an overcomer I'm more than a conqueror through him that loved me that I have to realize either this Reign on him well I just yield myself to him Lord I want you to be the Lord not just my savior I want you to be the Lord I want you to be the ruler of all things listen the Lord that's what I need this is from the from the message the statue of a perfect man and he says he said I want you to take it and study it and compare it and then act upon it see that's what God wants us to do to realize who we are what God is because these are requirements not not just not just to be born again so well I'm just I'm just in the family of God well that's good but you know what there's more than that that's required got it God has something he wants you to do he wants to there's a place for you it's like well I don't know why my place is well that's Now's the Time to be think you know praying about it and seeing what God wants you to do and realize God has equipped you to be a member a productive member of the body of Christ you know because everybody in the family's got a job and we all no matter how small or insignificant God gives us a job God places Us in the body and we don't we've got to do that portion because you know what without each individual person without each end of a member of the body you know we're incomplete we all have whether we think how we look at ourselves and realize well we look at ourselves as insignificant but you know what in the mind of God that's not the way God sees it God sees you as a valuable portion of the body a valuable part of the body God wants you to realize who you are well you because you know I want to look at say well I'm not this I'm not no God wants you to recognize Who You Are and our goal our our job should be our desire should be you know just be faithful to what God has called us to he said I want you he said I want you to take it and state it compare it and then act upon it he said don't just study and compare it but act upon it when you do take it seriously to yourself don't say well I enjoyed listening at it I did too but to listen at it and then receiving is different amen see see it's different see he said there is seven qualifications to make the stature of God they continues on the seven Church ages and talks about the number of completion and drops down brother Graham says he said let's add to our faith these things then we might come to the full stature of Christ being joined together with Godly love fear of God reverence in our heart to one another deep respect to one another brotherly and sisterly kindness never vulgarity nothing but just the purity of Holy Ghost living see live together be a Christian walk with faith let the virtue of God flow through you let the knowledge of God when it comes to right and wrong when the devil presents something that's not exactly scriptural walk away from it that's right he said I can imagine them Apostles never acted like us they went around probably men a few words until they got in the pulpit they walked in and done what they were supposed to do and walked and walked out yes sir they had power they advert you they had no arguments with men they know where they stood that's all they know who they believed they kept on walking in the spirit doing only he said just like I said the other night one little nod that's all had to do all God had to do then nothing going to stop them they didn't question and study in in hum Hall and and worry like we do whether we should do this or that they went ahead and done it anyhow just one little nod that done it just as soon why they they could how could they know it it was a nod from God they had all these virtues in here all these qualifications and this first little knot of God compared with every bit of this and with his word they note it was the word of God and away they went didn't have to worry about nothing else when God spoke they went he said and then this is from Blasphemous names then when we have met these qualifications and become full of the virtues of God and the things of God then the Holy Spirit comes down and seals us into the kingdom don't know don't worry everybody will know you got it you won't have to say well glory to God I know I got it I spoke with tongues the
