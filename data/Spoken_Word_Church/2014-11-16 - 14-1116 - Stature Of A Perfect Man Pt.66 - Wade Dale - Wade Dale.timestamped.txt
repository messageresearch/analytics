[0:00] record okay
[0:07] put it right down here
[0:11] okay
[0:14] now there okay
[0:16] so what we're talking about uh wednesday
[0:18] night
[0:20] was that the three processes of grace is
[0:23] justification sanctification and the
[0:25] baptism of holy ghost now if you don't
[0:27] know those three stages by now you're
[0:30] way behind because that's really the
[0:32] foundation
[0:33] and really if you're born again i want
[0:35] to make this strong if you're born again
[0:37] you know that you went through those
[0:39] three stages if you don't know that you
[0:40] went through those three stages you're
[0:42] in one of those three stages somewhere
[0:45] if you're a christian at all all right
[0:47] uh i think we all
[0:49] can uh
[0:52] can relate to justification
[0:54] because you ask god to forgive your sins
[0:56] god does that all the time he forgives
[0:58] millions of people their sins they you
[1:00] know he's just
[1:02] if you believe in the lord jesus christ
[1:03] you'd be saved saved is not the same
[1:05] things filled with the holy ghost that's
[1:06] why they get confused
[1:08] where brother brown says the holy ghost
[1:10] and the new birth is two different
[1:11] things or the or the getting saved in
[1:13] heaven the holy ghost is two different
[1:14] things and it really is
[1:16] because you can be saved
[1:18] and not be bright
[1:21] never understand that you can be saved
[1:24] god will be just to forgive you of your
[1:26] past sins and if you pass away
[1:28] right then or anytime during that
[1:30] justification process
[1:32] you will be given eternal life but you
[1:34] got to go stand at the white throne
[1:36] judgment and do as it says in revelation
[1:38] 22 you're gonna have to be judged by
[1:40] your works
[1:42] and remember what the bible says about
[1:44] our works they're filthy rags
[1:46] so if there's any account against you
[1:49] you're gonna have to give an account for
[1:50] it right then
[1:51] all right actual white throne judgment
[1:53] you will not be a judge you will be
[1:56] judged
[1:57] because the judgment when you receive
[2:00] the baptism of the holy ghost your
[2:01] judgment goes on jesus christ
[2:07] when you when you get the holy ghost
[2:09] your judgment goes to jesus christ and
[2:11] he's already stood your judgment
[2:13] so you don't have to be judged anymore
[2:14] he's already went to hell took you down
[2:16] there with him so you don't have to go
[2:17] to hell anymore he's paid the price
[2:20] that's why i said the the new birth is
[2:22] one of the most ill-taught things and
[2:23] brother brown said i don't see that
[2:25] we're getting them to the new birth in
[2:26] other words we're just getting them to
[2:27] church
[2:30] because number one if you got the new
[2:32] birth you'll not turn the word down
[2:34] you'll do what the word says that's
[2:36] right okay uh above all cost you'll do
[2:39] what the word says okay whether it hurts
[2:41] your family members or whether it hurts
[2:43] you or whether it hurts your wife or
[2:44] your children or whoever
[2:46] jesus said for sake father mother sister
[2:47] brother follow me
[2:50] and that's the way we have to be
[2:52] uh you know if
[2:53] you see all these people that are
[2:55] moving away from the message
[2:59] the holy ghost can't move away from the
[3:01] message now look you can get
[3:03] you can be and it's like dad and i were
[3:05] talking the other day you can be
[3:07] you can be deceived
[3:09] because satan still works in your
[3:11] memories and conservation imagination so
[3:13] he's down there playing in that realm
[3:15] and you can be deceived but you won't
[3:16] stay in deception
[3:18] once a truth has been shown you
[3:22] see let's just take for example
[3:24] a preacher up in tennessee or whatever
[3:26] and he's preaching the word he's got it
[3:29] off a little bit but that's all he knows
[3:31] he hasn't heard
[3:33] it but he his interpretation of what
[3:34] brother brown said was wrong
[3:37] let's just say on a seed doctrine or
[3:38] whatever on two souls
[3:40] and if he continues on that he can have
[3:42] the holy ghost but he's gonna have to
[3:43] die
[3:44] yes okay
[3:46] he can't take the body change with error
[3:49] but now once that man has been
[3:52] exposed to the truth
[3:54] and explain the truth
[3:57] there's the difference if he rejects the
[3:59] truth he never had the holy ghost to
[4:01] start with
[4:02] it's pretty simple
[4:04] because brother man said word rejecters
[4:05] go to hell
[4:06] so that's just pretty plain if you
[4:08] reject the word that's given to you you
[4:10] reject that word
[4:13] then you're a word rejecter and an
[4:14] unbeliever and you go to hell
[4:16] but you can have a
[4:19] false doctrine
[4:21] but have the holy ghost now look let me
[4:23] let me give you a prime example f f
[4:25] bosworth
[4:27] was brother branham's right-hand man he
[4:28] was the old oak tree he was a faith
[4:30] believer he was a trinitarian he never
[4:33] really accepted the message that brother
[4:35] brown preached
[4:36] as far as the message of the hour for
[4:38] this day
[4:40] but he had the holy ghost say
[4:43] that's why i can say that billy graham
[4:44] has the holy ghost he has the holy ghost
[4:46] for his time and for his way he was a
[4:48] prophet i mean he's he's spoken of in
[4:50] the bible to go down to sodom to blind
[4:53] the sodomizer all right
[4:55] but he didn't progress on because it's
[4:57] like martin luther same thing with
[4:58] martin luther martin luther had to just
[5:00] show him by faith god quickened that
[5:01] just y'all lived by faith and that's
[5:03] where he was born again
[5:04] okay
[5:05] but now in this born-again experience
[5:07] here
[5:08] it's a little bit different than here
[5:09] but it is the same holy ghost right okay
[5:13] and it's like we were talking about
[5:14] using the example wednesday night of one
[5:16] cup
[5:18] now let's continue on with that cup and
[5:20] you'll see what this is talking about
[5:23] brown said god picks the glass up one
[5:26] glass right
[5:27] it's dirty
[5:29] okay
[5:30] now what god what's god going to do
[5:33] he's going to use this for a purpose
[5:35] that's why he picked it up
[5:37] all right so he's going to use it
[5:38] because he knows it's going to be a good
[5:40] glass
[5:41] all right he's the only one that knows
[5:42] it you don't he knows it's going to be a
[5:44] good glass so he takes this glass
[5:47] this dirty on outside and inside
[5:50] he cleans it out on the inside your
[5:52] brother don't talk about the inside all
[5:53] right he cleans it out washes it up a
[5:56] little bit cleans it out really good on
[5:57] the inside that's justification he picks
[6:00] it up
[6:02] but the cup's still dirty
[6:04] he's going to put it in use he picks it
[6:05] up but the cup's still dirty right
[6:07] that's justification
[6:09] all right sanctification he goes in
[6:11] there and
[6:12] cleans out the inside of the cup right
[6:18] cleans it out it's it's not in service
[6:21] it's set aside for service right
[6:24] but now still you can have fingerprints
[6:26] and all kind of stuff on the outside
[6:29] but when he fills it with water of the
[6:32] word
[6:33] there's the holy ghost
[6:35] now
[6:37] this
[6:39] these to me these are a culmination in
[6:42] this but these
[6:44] start washing the outside of the cup
[6:49] when you were talking to me on the phone
[6:51] daddy was telling me that that's why i
[6:52] was carrying on two conversations with
[6:54] him tonight i was listening to you and
[6:55] listening to him
[6:56] but it's true the cup is then washed on
[6:59] the outside
[7:01] sure that comes from the inside but
[7:02] where does it manifest
[7:05] outside
[7:06] manifest the out on the outside it
[7:08] manifests on the outside so that's what
[7:10] this is this is cleaning up the whole
[7:12] cup
[7:13] outside bottom rim the whole thing
[7:16] that's what the statue of a perfect man
[7:18] is
[7:19] then you have a perfect cup
[7:22] because remember it got marred down here
[7:23] and somebody throwed it in a satan you
[7:26] know throw it in the in the mud hole
[7:28] well god's cleaning it out because he's
[7:30] going to start from the inside out but
[7:31] the stack of the perfect man cleans the
[7:33] outside of the cup up cleans all the
[7:35] fingerprints and the smudge and the
[7:36] stuff and what it's been sitting in and
[7:38] all that that's what this is and that's
[7:40] what this comes to do it comes to wash
[7:42] all this out because remember
[7:44] brother brown says
[7:47] right in here right in here you see i
[7:48] got in between in between all these
[7:51] works now these are the words
[7:53] here these little waves come so he's got
[7:56] waves
[7:58] so what's this doing it's up here the
[7:59] whole time doing the washing
[8:02] remember the man poured the water in the
[8:04] top
[8:06] you know this wasn't on it
[8:08] on the sister shepard's dream that's
[8:09] what the headstone wasn't on it it was a
[8:11] flat top like a box he said
[8:14] man was pouring water in the box
[8:17] the stuff was coming out and running
[8:19] down the side
[8:20] so that's what this holy ghost does this
[8:22] one right here
[8:23] puts you in service and to make you a
[8:26] son and daughter of god
[8:28] this
[8:29] puts you more in service
[8:33] for adoption
[8:35] okay
[8:36] this is the spirit of adoption
[8:39] this you receive
[8:41] adoption
[8:43] not crying daddy daddy
[8:45] but here you him
[8:47] coming on up here okay so that's what
[8:50] this does if this don't finish the work
[8:53] sure you're born again sure your son and
[8:55] daughter are god but like i was saying
[8:57] wednesday night
[8:59] you're a spirit babe you really don't
[9:00] know your position you really don't know
[9:02] your place you don't know you don't know
[9:04] if you can you know god knows whether
[9:05] you can handle things or not right but
[9:08] he's got to let you know whether you can
[9:09] or not okay because he knows all things
[9:12] and you don't so we have to go through a
[9:14] journey
[9:15] him knowing who's going to get here and
[9:17] who's not
[9:18] but he put provisions in all these
[9:20] places
[9:21] uh you can call them bus stops
[9:24] you know you can you can bus stop at
[9:25] faith or bus stop and virtue and you can
[9:27] stop and get off
[9:28] that's right
[9:30] or you can get back on and he'll take
[9:32] you to knowledge temperance you
[9:33] understand so you have the choice still
[9:35] your fremont agency goes all the way to
[9:37] the day you draw your last breath
[9:41] you're a free mortal agent right yes
[9:44] and i love that you know why because
[9:45] that's why god gave you a soul so you
[9:47] could choose that's what we talk about
[9:48] wednesday night god gave you a soul
[9:50] so you could choose and that soul is
[9:53] faith or doubt
[9:55] not faith and doubt
[9:57] what god's trying to do is he's trying
[9:59] to
[9:59] work on the inside man first he knows if
[10:01] he can get the control tower clean
[10:05] then it'll start working its way out to
[10:07] the outside all right
[10:09] all right look right in here right in
[10:10] here you see i got in between these
[10:12] works here these little waves come what
[10:14] is it the holy ghost coming down through
[10:15] christ see holy spirit
[10:17] christ coming down the holy spirit is
[10:19] above all this welding this together
[10:23] remember you got to have two things
[10:24] which is you and god
[10:26] to weld you got you can't weld one item
[10:28] right you got to have two items to weld
[10:30] all right
[10:32] so it's you and god together as persons
[10:35] working this thing out but you know what
[10:36] he is he's the he's the gentleman he's
[10:39] the one that stands over here and you're
[10:41] the one that controls
[10:43] you say no no the holy ghost yeah the
[10:44] holy ghost is controlled
[10:46] but
[10:47] he's timid and a gentleman
[10:50] that's what the prophet of god said i
[10:51] love the way he explained that he's a
[10:53] gentleman in other words he doesn't say
[10:56] i'm going through that door he says no
[10:58] if you want me to go in that door i'll
[11:00] go in the door
[11:01] if you don't i'll stand out here and
[11:03] i'll give you all the blessings that i
[11:04] can give you in this room but if you
[11:06] don't let me in that room
[11:07] i'm not going to force my way in
[11:09] okay
[11:10] and that you know why there goes back to
[11:12] your free choice
[11:14] that goes back to your free moral agency
[11:17] to accept or to
[11:20] reject
[11:22] the holy spirit above all this welding
[11:23] this together building on what a perfect
[11:25] church
[11:26] for the capstone to cap it off you can't
[11:29] have imperfection down through here and
[11:31] have this come on top of that
[11:33] all right
[11:35] then we know that it's been manifested
[11:36] down through seven church ages seven
[11:38] messengers we read that last week let's
[11:39] skip on through
[11:44] it talks about remembering the bride
[11:46] tree that would be a good one for
[11:47] everybody to read or redo or listen to
[11:50] over again would be restoration of the
[11:52] bride tree how god restores
[11:58] and the way god is expecting us
[11:59] paragraph 340 as individual to grow
[12:04] say you can't depend on brother dale
[12:07] to make you grow
[12:09] know you can listen and be available for
[12:11] the word to help you grow but you're
[12:14] going to have to do the one
[12:15] to grow in yourself
[12:18] that's why we have provisions in the
[12:19] word
[12:20] remember brother dale talks about the
[12:22] promises
[12:23] we got promises god said if you'll do
[12:25] this i'll do this if you'll do this i'll
[12:27] do this
[12:28] all right you pay your tithes i'll pour
[12:29] out the win to the heaven
[12:31] you come to church you'll receive a
[12:32] blessing you don't come to church you
[12:33] won't get a blessing you don't pay your
[12:35] time you won't get a blessing you see it
[12:36] so it's just really it's not rocket
[12:39] science
[12:40] it's really not if the most illiterate
[12:42] person you're a little an illiterate
[12:44] person
[12:46] can't put together
[12:48] numbers and
[12:50] and and can't even read
[12:52] somebody have to read it for him that's
[12:54] an illiterate person brother brown said
[12:56] an illiterate person could receive the
[12:57] holy ghost that goes to the believing of
[12:59] the intelligence inside here
[13:02] okay you got enough human intelligence
[13:05] whether that man can read or not he can
[13:07] speak and he can see and he can hear
[13:10] and if he hears the word of god
[13:12] god quickens that to his heart being as
[13:14] simple even as he is
[13:16] god is still giving the holy ghost but
[13:18] you know what god will do
[13:19] then the bible says i'll lead you and
[13:22] guide you into all truth so he'll take
[13:24] somebody illiterate and he'll either do
[13:25] like you know brother gilfordie was
[13:27] illiterate
[13:28] you heard his testimony brother george
[13:30] he said i opened that bible up when i
[13:32] was about 17 years old you dropped out
[13:34] of school
[13:35] and real tough testimony but you know
[13:37] god brought him through all that look at
[13:38] him now
[13:40] but he said god he said if you save me
[13:44] and you want me to read this thing
[13:45] you're going to teach me how to read he
[13:47] said god came down just like a teacher
[13:49] in his brain and taught him those words
[13:52] he never went nowhere to learn how to
[13:53] read god taught that man i read
[13:56] he heard the words when it was being
[13:58] spoken when he was reading when he was
[14:00] looking at the word that word's hand and
[14:02] the way god and god was teaching him
[14:06] because you know he had to work for him
[14:08] he had to be able to read the bible
[14:12] and i think he reads it very well now so
[14:14] so god you know but see god saw the
[14:16] desire of his heart he when god changed
[14:18] his when god changed his heart
[14:20] to a different direction
[14:22] he said well i can use that man to get
[14:24] to some of these people that maybe
[14:26] i can't get to
[14:28] all right he can relate to him
[14:30] so that's what god done
[14:32] so if an illiterate person can receive
[14:34] the holy ghost and it's not rocket
[14:35] scientist
[14:37] and it's not a it is a mystery in the
[14:38] bible
[14:40] it is a mystery hidden from the wise and
[14:42] prudent
[14:43] but revealed
[14:45] unto babes yes
[14:48] such as we'll learn see there's the
[14:51] there's the uh fremont agency park such
[14:53] as we'll learn if you don't want to
[14:54] learn god's not going to teach you
[14:56] that's right but if you want to learn
[14:58] do what the bible says
[15:01] god will be he's just to teach you these
[15:03] things
[15:04] and in paragraph 341 these fellows
[15:06] wasn't required what these fellows are
[15:09] somebody each one wasn't required they
[15:10] were required for their age
[15:13] period 3 42 when a man possesses
[15:17] these kind of things then the holy ghost
[15:19] comes upon him
[15:20] no matter you might speak to tongues you
[15:22] might impersonate any gift that god has
[15:24] got
[15:25] you might do that but until these
[15:26] virtues here go into you
[15:29] you're still off the real true
[15:30] foundation of faith
[15:33] but when these virtues go in and you add
[15:35] that to that then you are a living
[15:37] monument
[15:38] you're living moving
[15:41] idle
[15:43] but these talk about the heathen they
[15:44] prostrate themselves to an imaginary god
[15:46] they prostrate themselves before an idol
[15:48] imaginary god and in an imaginary way
[15:51] they believe that that imaginary god
[15:53] speaks back to them see all that
[15:55] imaginary
[15:57] that's hedonism that's romanism they bow
[15:59] before all kind of saints and everything
[16:01] else and they have saints cecilia
[16:03] a houseguard and so many different
[16:05] things like that they battle that and
[16:06] actually believe that in an imaginary
[16:08] way
[16:09] what a type of it is of the true living
[16:11] god
[16:13] but when we not in an imaginary way but
[16:16] prostrate ourself before a living god
[16:20] a living virtue a living knowledge a
[16:22] living patience living godliness living
[16:24] power
[16:25] coming from a living god makes a living
[16:26] man a living image
[16:28] in the stature of god what's he doing
[16:30] the same things that jesus did
[16:33] walking the same way he walked doing the
[16:34] same things he did because it's not
[16:36] imaginary things
[16:38] there's a reality
[16:41] that proves it and that's your walk
[16:44] see what i mean how these virtues these
[16:46] building materials
[16:48] type in with the church messengers with
[16:50] the church ages now one of these days
[16:52] gonna take jesus words and study them
[16:53] out so that proved it
[16:56] i think he left that for us to do
[16:59] that is the house of god that is the
[17:01] house that god dwells in not a building
[17:03] with a big bale and a high steeple
[17:05] but a body has now prepared me a body
[17:07] that god can dwell in walk in see in
[17:10] talk in work in amen
[17:13] living instrumentality of god god
[17:15] walking on two feet in you glory the
[17:17] footsteps of the righteous the lord of
[17:19] god
[17:20] god walking in you for your written
[17:22] epistles read of all men and if the life
[17:24] that's in christ be in you you'll bear
[17:26] the life
[17:27] that christ bore
[17:29] amen i mean we've come to this
[17:32] spot
[17:33] that i don't want to move away from it
[17:35] until we know
[17:37] that
[17:38] where we are
[17:41] in our walk right
[17:44] because god listen if we're wondering
[17:46] about these things god can't seal it in
[17:48] that's right he's got to take a solid
[17:50] piece
[17:52] and weld it to a solid piece that's
[17:54] right
[17:54] not not a not us him he is he is you
[17:58] know super steel right he is uh
[18:01] harder than anything
[18:03] all right so
[18:04] now here you come up with a little with
[18:06] some
[18:07] clay or some mud okay
[18:10] is that gonna weld
[18:11] no no
[18:13] here you come out with some brass baby
[18:16] no not going well
[18:18] you got to come up with that same super
[18:19] steel that he's got that's right the two
[18:21] wells have got to be the same kind of
[18:24] material so what does he do he puts that
[18:26] material in you after you burp yes
[18:29] then you work on it
[18:33] working on the building
[18:36] right working on the building
[18:38] then when you get up to here it's iron
[18:40] and iron or steel and steel or whatever
[18:42] you want to call it it's not iron and
[18:45] clay
[18:46] iron and clay don't mix
[18:49] but down here
[18:52] we start out with clay
[18:54] that's what we are right
[18:56] but we're building a building
[18:59] so that god can work through not that
[19:01] not that you can be listen not that you
[19:03] can be when you come to this place right
[19:05] here you're not going to be popular
[19:07] number one that's true you're not going
[19:09] to be some great person
[19:11] that the world is going to put you on a
[19:13] pedestal
[19:15] no
[19:15] they didn't put jesus on one did they no
[19:18] okay so we got to go back to the
[19:19] characteristics of jesus right now jesus
[19:22] was accused of being around sinners and
[19:24] prostitutes and
[19:26] you know some people of a little shady
[19:28] character
[19:29] but he was there to seek and save those
[19:31] that were lost
[19:33] okay that doesn't mean for us to go down
[19:34] to the prostitute house or go to the
[19:36] gambling houses and try to win souls no
[19:39] no but we do need to have enough
[19:41] character to if somebody does have those
[19:44] problems can come to you
[19:47] and you can have enough of this
[19:49] bankrolled virtue enough
[19:52] bankrolling you know like brother brown
[19:54] said you you go out there to cash to
[19:55] check and
[19:56] and sufficient funds
[19:58] god says you don't have enough virtue
[20:00] you can't give it to this person
[20:02] but if you've got enough virtues you can
[20:03] give it out to the person
[20:05] then you know peter i think peter it
[20:07] didn't pump him up when he said silver
[20:08] and gold have i none he wasn't bragging
[20:11] he was honest
[20:12] he said man i ain't got it down to my
[20:14] name i can't pay for your hospital bill
[20:16] i can't even take you to the doctor
[20:18] but i got something that you need
[20:22] silver and gold have i none but such as
[20:24] i have what do you have
[20:26] yeah virtue he had the virtue of god not
[20:28] the virtue of peter the virtue of peter
[20:30] peter before his conversion would have
[20:32] said look dude sorry
[20:35] you know peter was just that way he said
[20:36] sorry man you just
[20:38] you just got bad luck you know
[20:40] but
[20:41] what come inside peter
[20:43] was compassionate just like the lord
[20:44] jesus with
[20:46] bartimaeus and all the ones that he had
[20:47] healed he stopped
[20:50] and you know jesus was actually jesus
[20:52] was saying the same thing
[20:54] because jesus didn't have a dime yes he
[20:56] was telling the woman at the well silver
[20:58] and gold how about none
[21:00] he was telling bartimaeus silver and
[21:01] gold how about none he was telling them
[21:02] that you know i don't have anything but
[21:04] what i have
[21:05] you know even the
[21:07] woman that touched him of his garment
[21:11] virtue went out of him
[21:13] but he had a virtue in him for her to
[21:15] reach and get a hold of him say hey
[21:17] if i could put touch to him of his
[21:18] garment i was telling him coming down
[21:20] the road
[21:21] you know that's not the only time that
[21:23] happened in the bible
[21:25] she's the first one
[21:26] but if you look in the book of matthew
[21:28] right toward the end of one of the
[21:29] chapters in matthew
[21:30] many touched to him of his garment and
[21:32] were made whole so she's not the only
[21:34] one that she was the first one recorded
[21:36] to touch to him of his government so she
[21:38] must have went and testified what i'm
[21:40] trying to say she went and testified she
[21:42] had a testimony service
[21:44] she said if you can just get to that man
[21:47] you ain't gotta talk to him
[21:50] you just gotta reach and get his clothes
[21:52] that he's wearing
[21:54] and you'll be made whole so you see how
[21:56] what it done it took her and it made her
[21:58] a witness so same thing with you if god
[22:01] heals you a certain way be a witness
[22:04] say hey god give me this prayer clothing
[22:06] he's healed me of this why don't you get
[22:08] one or i've got one i'll give you or
[22:10] let's you know let's pray right here
[22:11] let's do this and then the other
[22:14] that's what god wants us to be he wants
[22:16] to be some super spiritual that's right
[22:18] some way up where nobody can understand
[22:21] you and
[22:22] he don't want you to be
[22:24] where you walk around and you know kick
[22:26] centers off in the ditch
[22:29] that's not what this is
[22:30] you see what that says brotherly
[22:33] kindness
[22:35] godliness patience temperance all these
[22:38] things work in our life
[22:40] if we'll let it work in our life
[22:43] but it's not our
[22:45] knowledge
[22:46] it's god's knowledge amen all right so
[22:48] remember it's not something you can
[22:50] produce
[22:52] you just make yourself available by
[22:54] female agency you just move yourself
[22:56] over
[22:58] get yourself out of the way move
[22:59] yourself over
[23:01] and say god
[23:02] you know
[23:05] when a minister is preaching
[23:09] he does not have to preach the statue of
[23:10] a perfect man
[23:12] for you to gain these virtues that's
[23:14] right so i understand that
[23:17] you don't have to preach on the statue
[23:18] of a perfect man
[23:20] to get the knowledge of god
[23:22] no if brother dale's preaching on what
[23:24] he's talking about perfection now he's
[23:25] preaching on profession then you can
[23:27] gain
[23:28] godly knowledge
[23:30] god will show you all these things how
[23:32] to work if you'll just let him if you'll
[23:34] just listen not just sit there and let
[23:36] it be a commentary
[23:38] but we all gotta listen
[23:40] not to refute or listen and just say i
[23:42] don't understand say look god one word
[23:46] just give me one word
[23:48] a lot of times that's the way i get my
[23:49] sermon one word
[23:51] preacher be preaching he'll say one word
[23:53] that word will just and it's happened to
[23:55] you
[23:56] yes one word would just it's like a
[23:58] volume goes up a little bit higher
[24:01] you'll hear that word over all that
[24:03] other that you've heard you'll hear that
[24:05] one word
[24:07] predestination and boy when you do
[24:09] something clicks and it just it takes
[24:11] off
[24:13] but he may just be commenting on
[24:14] predestination he might not be preaching
[24:17] the sermon on predestination but what
[24:19] you're going to have to do is you're
[24:21] going to have to take and you've got to
[24:22] have that in there
[24:24] see how that and knowledge is important
[24:26] it's right down here close to the bottom
[24:28] right here in your baby journey
[24:31] you've got to have the knowledge of god
[24:34] not the knowledge of man sure sure it
[24:36] comes to the knowledge of man but it
[24:37] turns into the knowledge of god once you
[24:39] run it through that filter
[24:42] and but if you've never heard
[24:44] what's he gonna quicken
[24:48] he's not gonna quicken if you can if
[24:50] you've not ever heard it he can't
[24:51] quicken it
[24:52] but if you once you hear it then that
[24:56] key turns on
[24:57] and that starts the process of god
[25:01] i don't understand that
[25:04] then you need this you need some
[25:06] knowledge you need some holy ghost
[25:07] knowledge you know what you need to
[25:09] study a little bit
[25:11] bob says study to show yourself approved
[25:14] you study
[25:16] not brother dale right
[25:18] we we we've turned this message into
[25:20] almost like catholicism
[25:23] brother dale you do our praying
[25:25] you save our children now you live the
[25:27] life in front of them brother devil now
[25:29] i don't have to but you live life in
[25:31] front of him and you pray for him and
[25:33] sure we depend on brother dale for
[25:34] things like that because he's our pastor
[25:36] but
[25:38] go to work six days a week and you ain't
[25:40] even open your bible you haven't even
[25:42] listened to a sermon or you haven't even
[25:43] read you know a book or or even even
[25:45] just thought on something
[25:47] then you come in here sunday morning and
[25:49] you sat down and you go well i didn't
[25:50] get a thing out of that well you did you
[25:52] didn't
[25:53] it's because you didn't have anything
[25:55] you didn't put anything into it right
[25:57] this knowledge is not going to come
[25:59] remember these are overcoming
[26:01] that's right these are overcomings
[26:04] if you're going to be a christian
[26:05] you know if you're a
[26:07] if you're a um
[26:09] a doctor
[26:10] you study a long time to be a doctor
[26:12] right
[26:13] because you don't want to make mistakes
[26:16] you want you want to know what you're
[26:17] doing well same thing with the word of
[26:19] god
[26:20] i mean i may not physically ever open
[26:22] a message book
[26:25] like one week
[26:26] not even just not open a book but i'll
[26:28] sit and read quotes
[26:30] or i'll get a thought in my mind see
[26:31] that's my process because i'm trying to
[26:33] give it to you your process is you're
[26:35] trying to learn more about god because
[26:38] you know you don't know what brother
[26:39] dale's going to exactly preach on this
[26:40] morning right
[26:42] but you know the line up because he's in
[26:43] a line
[26:46] of
[26:47] being in other words be there for
[26:49] perfect even as you're probably in
[26:50] heaven is perfect so it's a positive
[26:52] attitude so you can kind of lean toward
[26:54] that but still
[26:55] you can read a book
[26:57] or listen to a tape
[26:59] and something will quicken to you
[27:01] if you're in line with god now if you're
[27:03] not if you just sit and don't do
[27:04] anything then
[27:06] then how's god going to talk to you
[27:10] and i know we live 80 percent of our
[27:12] life we live in the flesh we have to
[27:14] worry about bills and kids and family
[27:16] and cars and life and
[27:18] you know you name it
[27:21] but you need to give that 20 percent
[27:23] at least give 20 to god he only asked
[27:26] for 10.
[27:28] really
[27:29] i mean 10 of your time
[27:31] figure that out for a week and see how
[27:32] long i mean that's just
[27:34] it's a few hours you'd have to sit down
[27:36] and study to get 10 percent
[27:38] you know what i do is that
[27:40] i have a question when i'm reading books
[27:42] or listening to textbooks i have trust i
[27:44] ask questions about certain issues what
[27:47] i do i start praying and then i know i
[27:49] come
[27:50] to the sanctuary knowing that brother
[27:52] they're going to assume that some of
[27:54] them i've had it so many times sure
[27:57] that uh
[27:58] you know you get to talk to brother tell
[28:00] everybody right but you
[28:02] so many times right once you read
[28:05] and you have questions and concerns you
[28:08] take it to the holy spirit you don't
[28:09] know when he's gonna answer but every
[28:12] time any guy in my basement in new york
[28:14] i didn't have questions and sure the
[28:17] answers come okay and you just said oh
[28:19] my god yeah brother dale we are such a
[28:22] blessed congregation we have a shepherd
[28:24] like brother dale can i answer questions
[28:26] without you even answering and earlier
[28:28] three weeks ago i had questionnaire
[28:30] experts that had a list of things right
[28:32] but what happened is
[28:33] when i got to before i uh
[28:36] asked a question he did all the answers
[28:38] oh yeah and that's what i'm saying
[28:39] that's how you do you don't have to
[28:41] worry about reading the books he because
[28:44] you know from experience back back in
[28:46] the days we have history back together
[28:48] when you're talking to brother dale i
[28:49] have it takes a long time
[28:53] if ever i did that he would never get
[28:54] anything to study no study another to do
[28:56] so i decided up in there i was going to
[28:58] start talking to the holy spirit and
[29:00] tell him they put the question on my
[29:02] heart and then give it to brother dale
[29:03] in the pulpit and it comes forward and
[29:06] that's how you don't have to uh worry
[29:08] about what brother dale's going to
[29:09] preach about something going to cover
[29:10] something that
[29:14] see to me that's what happened in the
[29:17] first three church ages let me let me
[29:18] get this point we need to go because i
[29:20] don't want to hold them up
[29:21] sing so many songs upstairs okay when
[29:23] you start coming up through here we we
[29:26] we need to lean toward god more than
[29:29] anything because we're babies
[29:31] and god like he you know you got a
[29:33] question in your mind
[29:35] you can write it down if you want to and
[29:37] that's okay
[29:38] but like you said now what if what if
[29:40] what if you just asked me that question
[29:42] i just answer it
[29:43] well if this is not the holy ghost
[29:44] working on both ends if media if it's
[29:46] just me answering the question you're
[29:48] still going to have that question
[29:50] but if you've got a question and god
[29:52] answers that question see remember i do
[29:55] things amiss
[29:57] you understand what i mean i have a plan
[29:59] and it changed tomorrow or i have a
[30:01] thought in my mind and it changed in the
[30:03] night in two minutes but when god brings
[30:06] something
[30:07] it don't ever change so you you know and
[30:09] have confidence that when he brings
[30:11] something to you like that
[30:13] that he has brought you the truth and
[30:14] he's brought you the answer not some
[30:16] answer
[30:18] see i can give you some answers right
[30:21] you understand what i'm saying i'll give
[30:22] you some answer to a question yes right
[30:24] but when god answers that and that plops
[30:26] down in your heart and you say well man
[30:27] that's the only way it could be see that
[30:29] that's the only answer that you could
[30:31] have for eternity god can't change his
[30:33] mind about that answer so if he get he
[30:35] doesn't answer a myth so when god
[30:37] answers your question that's why brother
[30:39] branham and when when that angel told
[30:41] him said you get the people to believe
[30:42] you
[30:43] nothing will stand in your way
[30:45] man what kind of confidence would that
[30:47] be if an angel come and told you that
[30:50] and said nothing will stand in front of
[30:52] you not even cancer so what are you
[30:53] scared of right i mean sure our human
[30:56] inability
[30:57] is scary
[30:59] but when god comes and gives you an
[31:01] answer or god comes and gives you
[31:02] something
[31:04] people that's eternal you got a bank on
[31:06] that you it doesn't matter what
[31:07] circumstance goes here and there all
[31:09] that stuff that goes here is external
[31:11] and it just flows out and you know what
[31:13] it does it just washes away we don't
[31:15] let's go we don't let it go
[31:17] y'all don't yeah right we don't let it
[31:18] go we make little pockets right here and
[31:20] we stop and say oh well maybe not no we
[31:22] need to let it go
[31:36] yeah that's right
[31:37] absolutely
[31:38] he's gonna marry a wife not a baby
[31:40] you're exactly
