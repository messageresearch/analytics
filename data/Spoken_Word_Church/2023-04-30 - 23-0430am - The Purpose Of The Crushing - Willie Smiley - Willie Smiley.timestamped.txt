[22:30] pray that you just continue to have your
[22:32] way we ask these in other present
[22:34] blessings in Jesus name reaction amen
[22:37] amen amen you may be seated this morning
[22:42] um we just like by the grace of God to
[22:44] use as a topic the purpose of the
[22:47] crushing and just a little subject that
[22:51] we approached at home uh during the
[22:55] Easter holiday pre-easter because
[22:57] brother Jack preached the East sermon
[22:59] and uh some things that we were just
[23:02] trying to
[23:03] um
[23:04] encourage the church by uh
[23:08] a lot of times I I realize in working
[23:12] with people I passed it a little bit
[23:13] about 23 years I don't anymore but uh we
[23:17] just kind of assist uh my brother-in-law
[23:20] brother Jack and and just working with
[23:22] the Saints there in West Palm Beach and
[23:25] just one of the things that I I've grown
[23:28] to realize uh and just talking with
[23:31] people and listening to people uh the
[23:34] purpose of things for a lot of people
[23:36] people
[23:37] uh they feel like well this is not
[23:40] necessary and and and that's not
[23:43] necessary uh the word purpose it means
[23:47] the reason for which something is done
[23:50] or created uh for which something exists
[23:56] and and when when we think about God uh
[24:00] just be when there was when there was
[24:02] nothing and nobody to uh consult in his
[24:07] mind God uh had purpose for just
[24:12] everything that was was done is that
[24:14] right how many could say Amen to that
[24:16] and and you know we we we're talking
[24:20] about a sovereign God is that right we
[24:23] were talking about infant knowledge
[24:26] right and and for me I don't I don't
[24:30] think that anything could supersede the
[24:32] knowledge of God the the principles of
[24:36] which God laid things out is that right
[24:40] and so for me now this is me I don't
[24:43] know about anybody else because you know
[24:45] everybody else got their own mindsets
[24:47] and and especially in a day of of of
[24:50] reasoning and and and and just false
[24:54] light and things of that nature we we
[24:56] find that when when people look at at
[24:59] scripture you know they pulling out this
[25:02] and they're pulling out that and this
[25:04] don't mean this don't mean that anymore
[25:07] and and we're living in a age of
[25:10] confusion
[25:12] is that right I think I heard somebody
[25:14] say it you know you you just don't
[25:17] hardly know what to call anybody anymore
[25:19] he she they them you know all these
[25:23] these plurals and and just so much so
[25:28] much nonsense that don't coincide with
[25:31] what God's purpose was I mean God in the
[25:36] beginning in his mind he he had family
[25:38] in his mind he purposed when he brought
[25:42] into existence Adam and so Adam you know
[25:45] was lonely he brought you know forth Eve
[25:48] from the side of Adam that was the
[25:51] purpose of God that that was to
[25:55] establish a man uh uh a picture
[25:59] and also to show what was in just God's
[26:03] mind because what was in God's what was
[26:07] in God was attributes and and so what we
[26:11] see in Genesis was the expression of the
[26:15] attributes of God Amen right I mean when
[26:19] when you go back to Genesis you see uh
[26:23] us a real standard you you see you see
[26:26] real family you see you see real order
[26:30] is that right is that right you see you
[26:34] see you see perfection in Genesis
[26:37] glory to God now now we working
[26:42] towards that we know by thought these
[26:45] things has been restored we thank God
[26:47] we've had a prophet
[26:50] you know we we're in a season now where
[26:53] where people are walking away from the
[26:55] word of God and things of that nature
[26:58] and and that's their choice because
[27:01] they're free more ages that's that's
[27:03] their choice to do that but but to me it
[27:08] shows that people have a lack of
[27:10] understanding amen that that they miss
[27:14] they they have missed the objective of
[27:16] of God sending us a a prophet and and
[27:21] what was his motives and what was his
[27:23] his
[27:25] his his intentions were were all about
[27:28] is that right and and for me it is to
[27:32] kind of show us what was in the mind of
[27:35] God see with without Genesis and Genesis
[27:39] being the seed chapter of the Bible we
[27:42] wouldn't have no picture
[27:45] right we we wouldn't have a picture we
[27:48] wouldn't have anything to look back at
[27:51] then how could you know preaching the
[27:55] scriptures speak of Redemption how could
[27:57] we actually uh use that type of
[28:00] terminology if we had nothing to look
[28:04] back to
[28:07] right and because we got something that
[28:11] we could look back to we could talk
[28:14] about Redemption
[28:16] right right we could we could we could
[28:18] talk about Redemption we could we could
[28:21] we could uh use this terminology purpose
[28:27] right
[28:28] when we see when we see the complete
[28:31] layout of God right oh I like like that
[28:35] we can look back and see a perfect
[28:37] Church
[28:40] Hallelujah that's that's wonderful
[28:43] right amen we we could look back and see
[28:47] things in order things and things in a
[28:50] Oneness right you could see you could
[28:53] see uh families and Oneness and in order
[28:57] and brother Brandon makes a statement
[28:59] and what does he say that's a that's a
[29:01] wonderful picture just to paraphrase it
[29:04] right that's a wonderful picture
[29:08] to see everything that that's that's in
[29:11] order right you know the wife with the
[29:14] husbands and husband with wives and them
[29:17] with children
[29:20] right so when I started to look at that
[29:23] man I appreciate God sent on a servant
[29:27] amen because we didn't even have a clue
[29:30] just just you know uh bits and pieces I
[29:33] was able to listen to the uh uh uh
[29:37] Sunday school lesson now who who was
[29:39] that can I can I see who that was amen I
[29:42] I really do appreciate that uh those
[29:45] those different principles because I
[29:47] wish I had those things when when I was
[29:50] a younger man you know uh growing up
[29:54] before I got married I would have
[29:57] understand you know I won't go into that
[30:00] boy because those things they close to
[30:03] my heart in this season uh because I'm
[30:06] you know you never too too old to learn
[30:09] and grow and and uh you you just got to
[30:13] be a student
[30:14] right at all times you you never no
[30:18] matter how old you are you never too old
[30:21] to be a student
[30:23] to be able to learn and and I think
[30:27] these things for a younger generation
[30:30] it's it's just so so important right
[30:34] right to really be able to comprehend
[30:37] all of these little principles let me
[30:39] get off of that
[30:40] because I'm starting to feel I'm
[30:43] starting to feel good on that those are
[30:46] the things I I it's just been close to
[30:48] my heart at home and just trying to make
[30:51] sure that uh this younger generation
[30:54] don't don't do like you know we did we
[30:57] didn't we had to reveal word but I just
[31:02] some some things was missing when I was
[31:04] coming up being a Christian 35 years it
[31:07] was a lot of doctrinal things and and
[31:09] trying to really establish this and then
[31:12] you know I come out of a certain uh view
[31:16] of the word and uh come into the
[31:19] knowledge of the truth and you just saw
[31:21] a Class of the Titans
[31:24] back then you know I mean and so it left
[31:28] us kind of uh lacking in certain areas
[31:32] in certain areas you know we were
[31:36] Christians but we we didn't have a full
[31:39] grasp on on you know our roles you know
[31:43] uh what my role would be as as a as a a
[31:47] Christian and as a husband as a father
[31:50] and and so on and so forth and my wife
[31:53] it's just so much that we didn't we
[31:57] didn't get so you we just kind of went
[31:59] in that blind man we went in blinded and
[32:04] so we we just kind of made a lot of
[32:07] mistakes
[32:08] you know we made a lot of mistakes that
[32:11] if if we educated ourselves uh from a
[32:15] from a younger age and uh not not that
[32:18] things would go smoothly because we
[32:21] we're in a contest this morning right we
[32:24] we are still fighting the Devil he's
[32:26] he's still a good adversary that's for
[32:30] sure he's he's still a good adversary
[32:33] but we will we would have known a little
[32:36] bit better how to combat
[32:39] right combating throw them out a lot of
[32:42] areas we wouldn't make the kind of
[32:44] mistakes
[32:45] that we made
[32:48] right glory to God so I mean even in
[32:52] this season those things are purpose
[32:55] purpose I don't think that was about
[32:57] mistake right
[33:01] see my brother had to be crushed a
[33:04] little bit
[33:07] you know
[33:09] so so that uh uh uh somebody else would
[33:14] benefit from his crushing
[33:18] but but like we say that's that's a
[33:22] purpose in in God always has been
[33:27] right always always has been a purpose
[33:31] of thought not just something that's
[33:33] random
[33:34] right right
[33:36] we're not dealing with just random
[33:38] things
[33:39] God's sending us a prophet it wasn't
[33:41] just random
[33:44] right
[33:44] it was scriptural yeah see when people
[33:49] look at us and they criticize and all
[33:51] those guys now this is not random we're
[33:54] not here randomly
[33:56] we we we're part of what God had in his
[33:59] mind what God purpose for for this hour
[34:03] in which we're living in like not just
[34:07] some random group of uh uh carnal-minded
[34:10] people that have come together and and
[34:13] gathered in them no we could look back
[34:15] to scripture and see where where God had
[34:20] foreordained God used the prophet to
[34:24] speak about another Prophet coming
[34:28] and and with his coming his coming had a
[34:31] purpose
[34:33] right amen and it is far beyond belt
[34:36] buckles and all right right it's it's so
[34:41] much deeper than than him and and all of
[34:44] those different things he his in his
[34:47] coming in the purpose of his coming it
[34:50] was to turn us back amen uh to
[34:54] an original yeah
[34:57] on an original phone an original program
[35:01] of God
[35:03] right not something that's man-made and
[35:05] man set up and you know hierarchy and
[35:09] all of those different things to turn us
[35:12] back to God himself
[35:15] turn us back to real worship of God
[35:19] glory to God Amen not the worship of
[35:23] humanity but real worship of God by the
[35:26] word
[35:27] I believe that was that was purposeful
[35:30] uh when it come to God
[35:33] but but when we look back to Genesis we
[35:36] we could see the purpose of God right we
[35:39] could see the expression of the
[35:42] attributes of God Amen is that right and
[35:45] and and we could look back and we get a
[35:48] real uh uh good view a good picture you
[35:52] know looking at the fall We Don't Preach
[35:55] apples and things of that nature
[35:58] we realize we realize what those things
[36:01] were right Eve opened up the wound of
[36:05] her mind and she accepted a wrong seat
[36:11] right right
[36:12] amen she she should have she should have
[36:16] kind of kept going but it just really
[36:18] shows you uh uh the the intellectual
[36:21] mind and reasoning you can't do that
[36:24] with the Devil and I think for a lot of
[36:27] people that have walked away and things
[36:28] of that nature it's the same spirit
[36:32] intellectual men and and trying to
[36:35] reason and instead instead of letting
[36:37] God reveal
[36:40] his plan and purpose to him they they
[36:44] want to kind of reason and just kind of
[36:46] make a lot of things personal yeah
[36:50] you know personal attacks and things of
[36:52] that nature but uh we we have something
[36:56] that's far greater than that
[36:58] right but but we we we look in Genesis
[37:02] and we find the fall
[37:05] right amen we we
[37:08] find Eve lusting for a PhD
[37:14] less than to Beast to be smart
[37:17] and I I'll just say this and I hope this
[37:20] be okay she broke protocol in doing that
[37:24] right she bypassed her head
[37:29] yeah right she she bypassed her head she
[37:33] bypassed order she broke protocol in in
[37:37] order to to accept something
[37:39] intellectually yeah right right because
[37:43] because if she would have went to her
[37:45] head
[37:47] initially I don't believe that she would
[37:49] have gotten in the in the position that
[37:51] she found herself in right and and she
[37:55] probably thought that she had a a
[37:58] greater understanding than than what
[38:01] Adam had given to her but then she found
[38:05] out oh my
[38:07] it was what I thought it was and and
[38:10] that's just like unbelief come on
[38:13] I believe really is not what it is
[38:16] cracked up to be
[38:19] yeah
[38:20] in the beginning stages it seemed like
[38:24] man this might not be so bad
[38:27] you know I don't know about y'all but I
[38:30] I didn't really grow up in the back seat
[38:32] of the church
[38:34] um I was kind of what they call the
[38:36] hootlum
[38:39] but it was by choice it was it was
[38:43] making a bad decisions I mean my mother
[38:46] took us to church we didn't I didn't
[38:48] grow up in the message but I kind of my
[38:50] mother was part Apostolic part Baptist
[38:54] sheet as a kid my grandmother was
[38:57] old-fashioned Pentecost amen and she
[39:01] died that way she didn't she didn't you
[39:04] know change when she died she still had
[39:06] a skirt on and her blouses you know and
[39:09] stuff like that she wasn't showing
[39:11] cleavage and and nah nah but that was
[39:15] just too strict for my mother so you
[39:17] know she went to the Baptist Church and
[39:19] uh
[39:20] that was a little bit more lenient and
[39:24] things of that nature so I had both you
[39:27] know things coming up but at a young age
[39:31] I made some bad decisions that that took
[39:35] me by the way of you know the streets
[39:37] and and drugs and and you can you won't
[39:41] be able to tell about looking at me now
[39:42] but if you just saw me in 1988 you know
[39:46] I was about this big
[39:49] and I was all messed up from cracking
[39:53] some everything else that I was on but
[39:56] but I but I thank God that that when I
[39:59] actually got converted I got converted
[40:03] in the message
[40:04] [Music]
[40:06] the the first day I was working on a
[40:09] church in West Palm Beach that you know
[40:11] uh I was a part of brother Westco uh
[40:15] they were building and I'm a drywall
[40:16] finisher by trade and I walked in there
[40:19] that day and I was leading God like
[40:23] you know I you never needed God before I
[40:27] just really without God I would have
[40:30] perished because I was kind of suicidal
[40:32] and everything but you know I'm grateful
[40:35] for God purposing yes yes right God God
[40:39] send me
[40:41] and know what age knowing what time
[40:44] knowing the season God ordering my steps
[40:50] uh we used to sing this song all of my
[40:54] steps in your word
[40:57] somebody know how to preach with me
[41:00] I like that uh God ordered my steps and
[41:04] I'm so glad that he did
[41:07] is that right amen he he brought me to
[41:10] he brought me to to truth amen is that
[41:13] right he brought forth for change in me
[41:17] amen right that I don't think that I
[41:20] would have gotten in any other uh
[41:23] denominational Church my brother Wade
[41:25] told me to
[41:27] I ain't got much time this morning so I
[41:31] I I'm slow
[41:33] and uh you know I I mean I have to tell
[41:36] him at church I'm not an old old man but
[41:39] I'm not a young young man anymore so I
[41:43] can't spin around and like that like
[41:45] little brother Andrew gloving them they
[41:47] kick a stomping he's probably been down
[41:50] the aisles by now yeah
[41:53] him and brother Solomon but I'm a little
[41:56] older now so I just don't move as much
[41:59] I just try to I just try to bring out
[42:02] things that you know because one of the
[42:05] things that I've learned over the years
[42:06] we've had a lot of excitement
[42:10] right we've had a lot of excitement and
[42:13] all of that but sometimes you have to
[42:15] look at where all of those people right
[42:18] right yeah we're we're all the peoples
[42:21] with the I'm quite sure what the amount
[42:23] of people that have come through those
[42:25] doors and if they would have stayed this
[42:27] place wouldn't even be big enough
[42:30] right amen so so you have to ask the
[42:34] question
[42:35] I'm I'm big on I'm big on asking the
[42:38] questions and it's and it's not it's not
[42:42] Ministry
[42:43] right now I could vouch for that and I
[42:46] ain't even a part of this local assembly
[42:48] it's not what's been preached but it's
[42:52] what's been quickened what what the move
[42:56] from here to here
[43:00] see that makes the difference it's got
[43:03] to move from here to here
[43:05] in order to bring the stability that's
[43:09] needed
[43:10] for for when you're challenged by the
[43:13] enemy up here
[43:16] right one thing I I can't reason enough
[43:19] I ain't that smart I don't have any
[43:21] diplomas or degrees or anything so I
[43:24] have to rely on what's been quickened to
[43:26] me by almighty God
[43:30] is that right so so we we see the Fallen
[43:34] Genesis is that right and and we we see
[43:39] initially you know Adam trying to do
[43:42] something with within himself
[43:45] that that was so contrary
[43:49] to uh scripture and what would be the
[43:54] purpose of God
[43:57] right amen and I often look at it from
[44:00] this standpoint because there's that
[44:03] that's that's protocol there's there's
[44:06] things that you know brother Brandon
[44:08] preached to message Christ being
[44:09] identified by his characteristics him
[44:13] being identified by his word is that
[44:15] right and so if if God would have uh
[44:21] justly uh allowed Adam
[44:24] to to uh uh
[44:29] adapt the Fig Leaf religion then that's
[44:33] what it would have been down through
[44:35] history
[44:36] right that that would have been the
[44:38] standard that would have been the
[44:40] program right
[44:41] right see Adam had no ability
[44:46] no ability to redeem
[44:51] right all right glory to God and I heard
[44:54] and I heard I heard this for the first
[44:56] time right here
[44:58] right uh uh where Adam took Eve he still
[45:03] couldn't redeem him
[45:04] [Applause]
[45:05] right he still couldn't because he
[45:08] didn't even know the program of God
[45:11] he still didn't know what was what was
[45:14] in in God's mind
[45:16] he couldn't he couldn't see how God was
[45:19] going to use blood down through
[45:22] scripture he couldn't see that so him so
[45:25] him taking Eve never really never
[45:29] redeemed right that was a lamb slain
[45:32] before the foundation of the world that
[45:35] was principles that were going to come
[45:37] into play
[45:38] amen after God comes on the scene and
[45:43] make the provision yeah see my God shall
[45:47] supply amen oh see man could not supply
[45:52] to me
[45:54] man could not meet the need for
[45:57] Redemption
[45:59] couldn't do it to intellect the man Adam
[46:04] and all of the work that he put in I
[46:07] guess when we go on the other side maybe
[46:09] we'll get a chance to see that I'm not
[46:11] you know I don't know but I'd like to
[46:14] just stand there and watch the work that
[46:17] he put in and what he done and then God
[46:21] comes down and say Adam where you at
[46:29] like this yeah yeah Adam you know just
[46:32] watching it play out Adam where are
[46:36] you right and then Adam realizes ah it's
[46:40] not working
[46:41] this is not working because I still kind
[46:44] of feel condemned
[46:47] I don't know about you but I'm going
[46:49] over here
[46:51] you know you can stay there but I'm
[46:54] going over here because it's not working
[46:56] something is wrong here
[46:58] hey yeah some something is wrong right
[47:03] and so when God comes down now now
[47:07] everything is broken yeah yes right
[47:10] the harmony like a man of the husband
[47:13] and wife broke it yes right
[47:17] right this Fellowship yeah
[47:20] yeah every everything is broken and Adam
[47:24] did not know how to fix it
[47:28] that's kind of like a lot of folk they
[47:32] lives are broken
[47:34] and they be trying to fix it yeah
[47:37] and they be trying to fix stuff and you
[47:41] can't fix it without God
[47:46] see people people wants to bypass the
[47:50] atonements and and the orders and the
[47:54] layouts and structures right and and try
[47:58] to do things with within themselves
[48:01] and and it don't work right you you
[48:05] can't fix yourself
[48:07] I couldn't fix myself
[48:10] is that right glory to God I couldn't I
[48:14] couldn't I didn't know how I didn't know
[48:16] where the starting point was
[48:18] right I I I I didn't really realize you
[48:23] know I always just thought church was
[48:25] for Old Folks
[48:28] well praise the Lord
[48:30] I you know ain't no different than most
[48:33] young people you know they I feel like
[48:35] church just for my mom and my dad and my
[48:38] Grandmama them no no that's just not it
[48:43] church is for you too
[48:50] cause you can't fix yourself you can't
[48:53] fix your disposition you can't fix your
[48:56] attitude you can't fix your mindset on
[49:01] your own
[49:04] like the brother we're talking about you
[49:06] know his spending habits
[49:09] what but where where did those habits
[49:12] formulate from
[49:14] from his background and the people that
[49:17] he walked I'm with you on that bro
[49:21] I'm with you on that
[49:24] you know and then you wake up and like
[49:27] oh yeah
[49:29] this ain't good
[49:31] oh
[49:33] yeah just as far as I am
[49:36] yeah now that should be way up the road
[49:38] somewhere you should be yeah right but
[49:42] you're not right because because of your
[49:46] mindset was was really carnal yes
[49:49] yes right right
[49:51] amen and you know I've been there done
[49:53] that you know we I first got mad man we
[49:56] were trying to get everything we saw
[49:58] back in the day when when we didn't have
[50:01] laptops back then desktops cost you 1500
[50:05] yeah and printers cost you 300 500 stuff
[50:10] like we were trying to get everything
[50:11] not not realizing you know you just got
[50:14] to grow and build up to you can get to
[50:17] these things and not get yourself in the
[50:19] debt and stuff like that right but let's
[50:23] let's look at Genesis a little bit more
[50:25] you know Adam didn't know the program of
[50:28] God right
[50:30] yeah right so unfortunate it's it's a
[50:33] lot of Bible people today don't really
[50:35] know the program of God
[50:38] right it's it's still got to be blood
[50:44] see I appreciate the bleeding bloody
[50:48] word right
[50:51] sir you know we appreciate we appreciate
[50:54] Calvary
[50:56] listen let me tell you something God
[50:58] purpose that yeah
[51:00] see God knew that Calvary was necessary
[51:05] amen right right amen right
[51:09] and you can't it ain't something that
[51:12] you can bypass you can't shake enough
[51:14] hands
[51:17] right you can't shake enough hands to
[51:20] get in it put your name on enough books
[51:22] to get in the glory you got to come
[51:25] God's provided wait
[51:27] right God's provided way you you gotta
[51:31] follow the process
[51:33] that's that's been laid out right glory
[51:37] to God you know I come up a little about
[51:39] this I was baptized twice in the Baptist
[51:42] Church and I know what it's like the the
[51:45] the doors of the church open and to come
[51:47] up and shake the people hand right and
[51:51] get my name on the on the book right
[51:54] but it wasn't until I came to the
[51:56] message of the hour where I realized
[51:58] that there was a little scripture over
[52:00] there where Jesus was talking to
[52:02] Nicodemus and say buddy listen you must
[52:05] you must you must be born again why
[52:08] right yeah
[52:10] see it's it's vital it's something that
[52:13] you can't get around
[52:16] it's something that's required that you
[52:19] must be born again yeah yeah right right
[52:24] glory to God see you see uh well y'all
[52:28] still preaching that yes because they're
[52:30] still people trying to get in by a
[52:33] handshake or an association with you
[52:38] know brother Branham and his children
[52:40] and things of that nature
[52:42] or some great preacher being their
[52:45] friends
[52:46] or even now that's gonna disgusting just
[52:49] a little bit well I'm in the message
[52:56] right see you could you could be in
[52:59] something and not being something
[53:01] you can have an association
[53:05] see and that's what has happened to a
[53:07] lot of people they had an association
[53:09] and a mental conception but never really
[53:13] had a birth and the moment some real
[53:16] issues came
[53:19] right
[53:26] you know right the same idea with with
[53:30] Peter them they had an association oh
[53:33] yeah right with Christ there was a part
[53:36] of the church they they took part in
[53:38] Miracles and things of that nature right
[53:40] but when the shepherd was smitten then
[53:44] the Sheep kind of you know
[53:46] yeah
[53:48] he went and found Peter fishing and
[53:50] things of that nature right amen but
[53:53] when when Peter amen uh got a birth
[53:58] you never you never see a scripture
[54:00] where he backslid like that
[54:03] right amen and and so that's a part of
[54:06] what's what's been required uh
[54:10] in the evening time under under the
[54:12] light of the word
[54:14] right see people people think that
[54:17] brother banham came and did something
[54:18] that was outside of scripture his
[54:21] ministry was to turn us back to
[54:24] scripture Amen to show the fallacy and
[54:29] the things that people were doing that
[54:31] was so contrary to the scripture right
[54:35] right like like shaking hands
[54:40] right yeah and just being a part of of
[54:43] these systems and programs and things
[54:47] that were were set up amen correct right
[54:50] right amen this is not a denomination
[54:55] glory to God it's not amen see right
[54:58] this is a quickening this is turning our
[55:02] hearts this this is uh uh uh a work of
[55:06] Grace is that right this is this is real
[55:10] Fellowship under the bleeding bloody
[55:12] word
[55:14] yeah right
[55:16] so that's why when I see people doing
[55:19] what they're doing that's like they
[55:20] ain't got nothing to do with me
[55:22] come on y'all to preach with me somebody
[55:24] that that has nothing to do with me
[55:27] right because I appreciate what's what's
[55:31] been what's been uh quickened amen so so
[55:36] you know uh we we realize after the fall
[55:40] the fall the unbelief coming in it it
[55:44] brought it brought death it brought sin
[55:48] it brought this ideology that we see now
[55:52] all of this this this his and her and
[55:56] this and uh it it drives you crazy now
[56:00] right
[56:02] almost even on your job you just gotta
[56:06] be careful
[56:07] right you you used to stand up for what
[56:10] was right yeah yeah you you used to kind
[56:14] of stand up for real principles but but
[56:17] now the way that they got it they have
[56:19] more Authority
[56:21] uh uh than what the believer have and
[56:25] even brother banham told us back then in
[56:28] the 60s you know the inner workings of
[56:31] what was working in politics and the
[56:35] percentages of of these guys that had
[56:39] these different types of spirits on them
[56:42] working in politics
[56:45] and and now look at look at look at the
[56:48] the laws and the cancer
[56:51] Council cultures
[56:53] now and and the influence that these
[56:58] guys have
[57:00] right the influence it it takes
[57:03] something to stand for the word
[57:08] glory to God but but with with all of
[57:13] the unbelief that that kind of coming to
[57:16] existence
[57:18] you know
[57:19] uh God sent
[57:22] Christ
[57:24] on the scene
[57:26] and
[57:28] crushed him
[57:31] because
[57:33] it was necessary
[57:36] that's right right
[57:38] it was so a lot of times people people
[57:42] don't understand well why God had to do
[57:45] it that way and you know I'm reminded of
[57:48] a quote where brother Brown was talking
[57:50] about this smart guy or he couldn't
[57:53] understand how God uh uh you know this
[57:56] great God will allow these people to be
[58:01] put to death and to go through all of
[58:04] this trauma like that they went through
[58:07] not realizing he said you know uh uh it
[58:12] had to happen
[58:14] they had to you know see he had to fall
[58:17] into the ground and die it was it was
[58:20] necessary yeah for God's program
[58:25] see what people don't understand and we
[58:29] wouldn't either if we didn't have a
[58:31] prophet to open up our understanding so
[58:35] that we could see why under that day
[58:39] amen and its message back then these
[58:42] people had to be a man uh uh uh killed
[58:47] and martyred under the ox age right why
[58:51] why it was so necessary for the right
[58:54] because we we try to see God one way but
[59:00] God isn't God of Grace but God is also a
[59:03] god of judgment yeah right if if his
[59:08] father because most children want to uh
[59:11] the god their father to be the daddy of
[59:14] of just Grace you know and and smiles
[59:18] and and and just giving and buying and
[59:23] and but they don't want that Daddy with
[59:26] the Judgment rod
[59:29] see as as young adults you know my
[59:33] children still kind of looking looking
[59:36] at me like I was a tyrant foreign
[59:41] right but to me it was like
[59:45] you know I had multiple hats
[59:48] there was Grace there
[59:50] right because I wasn't a legalistic type
[59:53] person but but then you know there was
[59:57] times where you know brother Banner say
[59:59] you pay for neglect that I wouldn't
[1:00:03] neglect to use the rod
[1:00:06] the right the rod had its purpose The
[1:00:10] Rock was necessary because ain't none of
[1:00:13] them in jail
[1:00:20] see they may not be able to understand
[1:00:22] anything that I did
[1:00:26] but now some of like my oldest is you
[1:00:29] know uh shouldn't have his first be my
[1:00:33] first grandbaby and and all I always
[1:00:36] tell my children this I just pray to God
[1:00:39] that I'm around when y'all children
[1:00:42] start growing up
[1:00:49] thank you
[1:00:51] I just want to be a fly on all they
[1:00:54] walls
[1:00:59] so I could come back and critique
[1:01:05] huh I could critique but you didn't do
[1:01:08] that just did you yeah
[1:01:11] it was It was kind of the time when I
[1:01:13] think at the time I had three boys and
[1:01:16] uh you know it was coming up and I used
[1:01:18] to get on them and my wife used to say
[1:01:21] honey you you just too rough on them
[1:01:23] boys
[1:01:25] too rough
[1:01:27] I like really
[1:01:29] I say well listen they gonna whoop you
[1:01:31] they're not feeling whoop me
[1:01:35] unfortunately
[1:01:38] uh they're not gonna whoop me and and
[1:01:41] unless
[1:01:43] the next thing I know I see I got one by
[1:01:46] the ear
[1:01:48] walking through the hall real fast and
[1:01:51] angry looking I said honey you too rough
[1:01:55] on that boy she
[1:01:57] [Applause]
[1:02:00] she said she couldn't
[1:02:06] the next thing I know I hear kids
[1:02:09] getting whooped and I'm feeling sorry
[1:02:11] for them I'm like one time she was
[1:02:14] beating my second oldest
[1:02:16] and man on the cloud I'm like well
[1:02:18] what's going on in there
[1:02:22] man I went in there he's screaming and
[1:02:24] hollering and rolling out and kicking
[1:02:26] I'm like I felt sorry I wanted to grab
[1:02:29] the Bell honey take it no
[1:02:32] but I noticed you sped a ride you
[1:02:35] spoiled a child
[1:02:36] right
[1:02:37] so you get to the point where you know
[1:02:40] you you just have to stay biblical yeah
[1:02:43] right right amen but you don't you don't
[1:02:46] you don't just whooping anger
[1:02:48] you know I I never beat him while I was
[1:02:51] angry I always did things while I had a
[1:02:54] cool level head you know I'm one
[1:02:58] snatching them up because I'm a big dude
[1:03:00] yeah and uh I'm like I'm not going to
[1:03:03] jail for child abuse
[1:03:07] being this big Angry
[1:03:11] African-American guy just beat his
[1:03:15] little bitty no
[1:03:17] no I'm gonna be cool and calm you know
[1:03:21] my kids could tell you
[1:03:24] they've never heard me all yet they
[1:03:26] mother
[1:03:27] I've never raised my voice at them
[1:03:31] I feel like this is my house I don't
[1:03:33] have to be shouting and screaming but
[1:03:35] let me tell you something boy boy I will
[1:03:38] bust your head to the white meat
[1:03:42] really and you a Christian you busting
[1:03:46] the head too y'all know what I'm talking
[1:03:48] about to the white part show
[1:03:52] yeah
[1:03:54] man
[1:03:56] you need the ultimate
[1:04:00] you know but I discipline them but I
[1:04:02] discipline them with with a cool
[1:04:04] demeanor you know but they still say I
[1:04:08] was a tyrant because I beat him yeah
[1:04:11] yeah and I'll beat them again
[1:04:13] if I had to do it you know this is this
[1:04:16] is the weird thing if I had to raise my
[1:04:19] children all over again I raise them the
[1:04:22] same way
[1:04:25] you know pretty much with with I think
[1:04:28] with with more information maybe a
[1:04:30] little bit of things I might do a little
[1:04:32] bit differently but when I look at it
[1:04:35] holistically I can't see why I did
[1:04:37] anything outside of the world that was
[1:04:40] given to me by profit
[1:04:43] which was the mind of God
[1:04:46] right and how could I bypass that and
[1:04:50] say you know I could be an appropriate
[1:04:54] leader in my home
[1:04:56] trying to bypass the word and
[1:04:58] intellectualize it I I can't I couldn't
[1:05:01] do it so I I appreciate uh God sending
[1:05:05] us a prophet amen right amen amen to to
[1:05:10] just show me and teach me because I
[1:05:14] didn't have a dad
[1:05:16] you know if you got a dad I'm gonna tell
[1:05:18] you something you ought to appreciate
[1:05:19] well I'll put it to the light this way
[1:05:22] come on I had a dad
[1:05:24] but he wasn't much of a dad
[1:05:27] because he he would be in our lives
[1:05:30] periodically but you know he was you
[1:05:33] know he was he was what he was
[1:05:36] he drunk
[1:05:37] and that was his best friend
[1:05:39] yeah but I still love them to the day he
[1:05:41] died but I I I didn't gather the
[1:05:45] necessary knowledge that I needed to
[1:05:49] help me as a young man to navigate
[1:05:52] through Society I had to get my
[1:05:55] knowledge from society which was enmity
[1:06:00] to God
[1:06:03] right glory to God I had I had to throw
[1:06:06] all that that had to become dumb
[1:06:11] right so that so that you know there
[1:06:14] could be a transformation a renewing yes
[1:06:19] right right
[1:06:19] and I'm still renewing
[1:06:23] that that's still they're still right
[1:06:26] now and I'm 60 years old and that's
[1:06:29] still a constant renewing
[1:06:33] I passed it for 23 years but there's
[1:06:36] still a renewing
[1:06:39] right of of my mind
[1:06:42] glory to God
[1:06:45] what you better yes I'm not ashamed of
[1:06:48] that
[1:06:49] right I'm not I'm not ashamed of of
[1:06:52] growth

[1:13:42] um
[1:13:43] we were singing Lord prepare me to be a
[1:13:45] sanctuary every service that was what

[1:14:58] where he's going with it so we know
[1:14:59] being acknowledgeable that's why brother
[1:15:01] Jack said said y'all are a knowledgeable
[1:15:03] group you kind of know what's going on
[1:15:05] so
[1:15:06] we got to be crushed
[1:15:08] you gotta crush a rose before it really
[1:15:11] smells good
[1:15:13] you gotta crush a flower before you can
[1:15:15] really get the odor to it
[1:15:18] so that's what he's heading toward I'm
[1:15:19] sure
[1:15:20] is that we have to be crushed he had to
[1:15:24] get rid of his ideas I had to be crushed
[1:15:27] you had to be crushed you know sometimes
[1:15:29] we say you know something happens in our
[1:15:30] life we said boy that just crushes me

[1:15:34] got born again
[1:15:36] I crushed that crusty old you right out
[1:15:39] of you hey man that just crushed us
[1:15:42] because he was crushed at Calvary
[1:15:45] that's what we give back to him as he
[1:15:47] gives us eternal life and then crushes
[1:15:49] that old nature out and puts his nature
[1:15:52] in remember service at two o'clock this
[1:15:55] afternoon and he does have to catch a
[1:15:57] plane at nine o'clock but I think we can
[1:15:59] get him down there he can preach as long
[1:16:00] as he wants to and I'll get him down
[1:16:02] there fast enough if we get on a plane
