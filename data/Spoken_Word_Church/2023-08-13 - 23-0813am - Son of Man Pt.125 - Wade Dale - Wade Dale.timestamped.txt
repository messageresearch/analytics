[24:43] time that God has given me here in this
[24:46] world in this life
[24:51] I haven't had found the desire greater
[24:54] than to be able to be able to say to the
[24:57] bride of Christ God bless you
[24:59] all right
[25:03] I'm very happy for the opportunity that
[25:06] God has given me
[25:08] foreign
[25:13] because it was it's been taught to us
[25:15] that it was necessary for him to to go
[25:19] us
[25:21] but he was going to be with us in
[25:24] another form amen yes and that is going
[25:27] to be in his people
[25:31] the only way that I have it there in
[25:34] this time
[25:36] to be able to to hug the Lord
[25:40] be able to talk to the Lord is
[25:44] to talk to that little part that's in
[25:47] you
[25:49] [Applause]
[25:54] I I wholeheartedly believe
[25:58] that the way I treat you
[26:01] it's the way the Lord treats me amen
[26:07] there's many things that I could say
[26:11] for me that the Lord has done for me
[26:15] impression is
[26:17] one of the greatest things is to to be
[26:20] able to get to know you amen
[26:23] I have really enjoyed the way you all
[26:25] worship and Sierra tacos as different
[26:28] of course there's some things that are
[26:30] different from my country
[26:33] but we're all we're worshiping the same
[26:35] God
[26:38] um
[26:39] I have learned okay
[26:47] perfect the things are have been done in
[26:50] such a perfect way
[26:52] if you look
[26:56] if you take a fish out of the water out
[26:59] of the ocean
[27:00] he dies
[27:04] if you take a Son of God the supresencia
[27:08] out of God's presence he will die he
[27:14] there was a time okay
[27:18] as any young man
[27:22] um
[27:24] the world was calling me
[27:28] we're curiously we're naturally curious
[27:31] about the world
[27:34] it's just that type of curiosity doesn't
[27:37] lead to anything good
[27:42] but the Lord called me back
[27:48] I just want to just say a quick short
[27:51] testimony
[27:53] accident
[27:55] but an accident that I recently had
[27:59] I have not even told them in my church
[28:02] yet back home
[28:08] but I want to share with with this part
[28:10] of the Bride here in in the United
[28:12] States
[28:14] while I was driving
[28:17] um
[28:22] there was a curve that I was going
[28:24] through and I just kind of lost my my
[28:26] thinking
[28:30] I was not able to do the curve make the
[28:34] curve and I just kept going straight
[28:38] there was a tree yeah
[28:46] and I was only uh the only thing I could
[28:49] do was just grab the the steering wheel
[28:51] very tightly and just close my eyes
[29:01] wait for the impact and so that I would
[29:04] not go out out the windshield
[29:09] the Curious Thing was is that when I
[29:11] opened my eyes
[29:13] [Music]
[29:15] I did not hit the tree
[29:22] um
[29:23] I had hit other trees around the other
[29:26] smaller trees and I was the the car was
[29:28] was was turning
[29:32] um
[29:33] [Music]
[29:37] and I was going towards an embankment
[29:39] there was a concrete embankment I was
[29:42] heading towards that
[29:45] when I when I see that wall or that
[29:48] embankment
[29:49] I knew my head
[29:54] it is uh
[29:56] cuantos
[29:57] the only thing that I felt was and then
[30:00] he's asking you how how many of you have
[30:02] ironed clothes before
[30:06] have you burnt yourself with the iron
[30:08] before
[30:10] have you felt that yeah
[30:14] that's what I felt right back here on my
[30:16] side
[30:17] just a little small burn
[30:33] I was about 50 meters away from the area
[30:36] where I was supposed to hit
[30:39] and the car was completely destroyed
[30:46] I came out of there with nothing I was
[30:49] not harmed at all
[30:52] thank you
[30:56] so after that
[31:02] he took me to the clinic and they they
[31:04] looked they looked at me
[31:10] the only the only thing that I had was a
[31:13] little small burn that little burn that
[31:14] I felt right here on my side
[31:19] I believe that the an angel of the Lord
[31:22] or the angel of the Lord
[31:30] maybe as I was getting ready to hit that
[31:32] bigger tree uh maybe he just moved the
[31:35] the steering wheel and maybe that was
[31:37] his touch on the on my side I don't know
[31:43] um
[31:46] no no nothing
[31:49] is
[31:52] and not and coming out out of there not
[31:55] harmed and but yet the car completely
[31:57] destroyed
[32:00] and there's people that have died for
[32:03] Less smaller accidents
[32:05] [Music]
[32:07] um
[32:12] and I would like to show you maybe how
[32:14] how the car ended up
[32:22] let's see
[32:40] I know the brothers can get it get it or
[32:43] not
[32:51] um
[32:53] at some point the anime
[32:57] wanted to make me think that that little
[32:59] burn was was the uh was was the uh seat
[33:03] belt
[33:07] but the seat belt doesn't doesn't touch
[33:09] your backside yeah
[33:14] and then I I I I set up on the on the
[33:18] vehicle
[33:20] and I put on my seat belt
[33:25] the seat belt just goes through right
[33:28] here on the on on the front part
[33:31] and then around our waist but never that
[33:35] never this back part of your back
[33:42] he has something incredible I don't know
[33:45] if you can see how the vehicle ended up
[33:47] like
[33:53] I don't know if I have to do if if it's
[33:57] that the Lord still has something for me
[33:58] to do
[34:00] maybe he just didn't want me to go yet

[40:41] little boy let's like him Kinder grew up
[40:43] in this church a lot a lot of y'all grew
[40:45] up in this church and we sure do
[40:46] appreciate uh appreciate the Lord you
[40:49] know I tell you
[40:50] I just want to say something real quick
[40:54] there was a lot of time that
[40:56] that when Noah preached he preached for
[40:58] 120 years all right
[41:00] and I'm sure he made a lot of friends
[41:02] he probably didn't have just a
[41:04] Congregation of eight or seven okay
[41:06] probably had a Congregation of you know
[41:08] several hundred if it was in the day of
[41:11] Noah as it is today then you've got a
[41:13] you know congregation maybe like a
[41:15] hundred like we have here or so
[41:17] and
[41:19] but there was one day Noah preached his
[41:21] last message
[41:23] and God shut the door
[41:28] Noah probably did not want that to
[41:31] happen
[41:31] in his Humanity but we all know that
[41:34] we're coming to an end time
[41:36] and his brother Luke was preaching last
[41:37] night there is going to be an end of
[41:40] this race
[41:43] and we're going to run it well
[41:47] but I'll promise you
[41:49] when that door shut on that Ark
[41:52] that was claw marks of those people
[41:54] trying to get in that thing
[41:56] but it was too late
[41:59] I'm not trying to scare you I'm trying
[42:00] to warn you but the art door is getting
[42:02] ready to close
[42:03] we're getting ready this Gentile
[42:05] dispensation will be done away with
[42:08] and there's nothing we can do about it
[42:10] but we're going to get our kids in we're
[42:13] going to get our grandkids in somebody's
[42:15] saying man we're going to get our family
[42:17] in we're going to husbands wives we're
[42:20] going to as the Bible says compel them
[42:23] to come
[42:24] all right we're going to do all we can
[42:25] you can't make them my Mama Tried to
[42:27] save me for 20 something years
[42:29] couldn't do it but when God ever got a
[42:32] hold of me that's the one that'll save
[42:34] your soul that's the one that will drive
[42:36] you to your knees that's the one that'll
[42:37] drive you to think about your soul not
[42:39] about what's going on around you I know
[42:41] it's hard to get to church it's hard to
[42:42] stand up it's hard to do listen like
[42:45] brother Luke was talking about last
[42:46] night and you know being athletic like
[42:49] he is different different things you you
[42:51] train
[42:52] and training has never been cheesecake
[42:55] and ice cream
[42:57] are spoons and forks
[42:59] it's been vital storage
[43:02] stuff you put on and and you know the
[43:04] equipment that you use well listen we've
[43:06] been equipped for this battle
[43:07] somebody will win this race
[43:11] I'm just dumb enough to believe it's all
[43:13] of us amen myself included all right I'm
[43:16] just I just believe you got to be a
[43:18] believer
[43:19] so we're believing
[43:21] I promise you
[43:24] it's worth it
[43:26] there ain't nothing out there in this
[43:27] world you can't sit at home and watch
[43:29] television deer hunt or and that's gonna
[43:31] talk about me and everything else you
[43:33] can just put XYZ in there whenever you
[43:34] want to you sit at home

[46:29] word was with and the word
[46:33] and the Word was made flesh that's the
[46:37] key
[46:38] the word was made flesh and I want to
[46:41] say in you and in me as we were singing
[46:45] that song about in the tents and then
[46:46] the Tabernacle that was a physical thing
[46:48] that was in the new Old Testament but
[46:50] now you're standing in the Tabernacle
[46:51] that God wants to dwell in you're
[46:53] standing in the tent that God wants to
[46:54] dwell in amen he don't worry about cloth
[46:57] and wood and stone and all that but what
[47:00] he wants to take your flesh and use you
[47:02] for his honor and glory and the Word was
[47:04] made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[47:06] behold his glory the glory the only
[47:07] begotten of the father
[47:08] four somebody say four four of Grace and
[47:13] Truth amen you can be seated in the Lord
[47:14] has blessings for the reading of the
[47:16] word we're going to continue on today
[47:18] it's something I want to bring out that
[47:19] brother Keith struck uh last Sunday
[47:23] about a little a little Park that we've
[47:25] got to go through as we go up to Statue
[47:27] of perfect man listen it's not easy it's
[47:29] a battle like I said it's not a picnic
[47:31] would he bring Fortune spoons we brought
[47:33] swords all right so you come today you
[47:35] come battling to get here you'll battle
[47:37] your way back home now man you'll battle
[47:40] your way up tomorrow go to work because
[47:41] it's Monday morning
[47:43] and I pray like somebody said the other
[47:45] day I pray that the Rapture takes place
[47:47] on Monday morning so the devil will be
[47:49] stranded the whole day Monday and not
[47:51] have nothing else to do with the bride
[47:53] hey man think about that John 3 verse 3
[47:56] says Jesus answered and said unto him
[47:58] verily verily now look listen listen
[48:01] verily verily
[48:02] I say underly accept the man be born
[48:05] again he cannot see
[48:08] or understand the kingdom of God
[48:11] nicodema said how can we be born and
[48:14] we're old and uh you know he's all
[48:16] carnal got all kind of carnal stuff
[48:18] going on Jesus said look man come on I'm
[48:21] going to say one more time barely verily
[48:23] except a man be born of water and of
[48:25] spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom
[48:28] of God that which is born of the flesh
[48:30] is flesh so we have as Paul said we have
[48:32] had our conversation in times past in
[48:34] the lust of the flesh but now we have
[48:37] another life the night the life I now
[48:39] live that's what we've been talking
[48:41] about but now we're going to go back
[48:42] down to the bottom as as we were talking
[48:44] about as brother Luke was talking about
[48:45] last night on the cornerstone in a
[48:47] headstone you got to start at the bottom
[48:49] you got to start at Faith you've got to
[48:51] start down at the bottom of the pyramid
[48:52] you got to start at the new birth not
[48:55] just an emotion not just something you
[48:57] you like this message and and you want
[49:00] to listen because you you know more than
[49:03] your neighbor
[49:07] that's why sometimes this message has
[49:09] become as all the years I've been
[49:10] listening and watching people it's more
[49:12] like well I got something you ain't got
[49:14] you got to come to me to get it no you
[49:17] got to go to Jesus and get it
[49:19] you got to go to Christ and get it and
[49:22] when you get to Christ and you do get it
[49:24] he'll bring you to the message
[49:26] he'll have to because the message is a
[49:28] word of God Amen but it's got to be
[49:31] flesh first Paul said to let her killeth
[49:33] in other words all my quotes all my
[49:35] sermons that are written down are going
[49:37] to kill you
[49:38] all them 1100 sermons and William
[49:40] Branham is going to kill us if we don't
[49:42] take that off the page and put it in
[49:45] here
[49:45] and what make it live
[49:48] look he says Marvel not that I say you
[49:50] must be born again
[49:52] First Peter 1 verse 22 says seeing you
[49:54] have purified your souls in obeying the
[49:56] truth through the spirit unto unfeigned
[49:58] love of the Brethren now this is after
[50:00] you're born again this Peter's already
[50:01] Born Again Peter's fixing to tell us how
[50:04] that God's going to mold us into His
[50:06] Image all right we come into the family
[50:08] of God listen we've gotten the right
[50:10] place we've gotten the right building
[50:12] we've got in the right atmosphere all
[50:15] right and now he wants us to be born
[50:17] again now that we're born again he does
[50:19] not want us if you take those twins back
[50:21] there where'd they go
[50:22] I'm going to use it for an example
[50:24] but anyway so you got those two babies
[50:26] back there two twin beautiful little
[50:28] boys
[50:30] beautiful they're humans they're born
[50:33] but if you take them two and you go put
[50:35] them in that study right there pretty
[50:37] steady brother Dale's had many good
[50:39] sermons come out of that study and and
[50:41] we've had many good ministers in there
[50:42] so maybe the power of God's in that
[50:45] study but you lay them two babies in
[50:47] that study and come back three months
[50:48] later
[50:49] well I ain't gonna tell you what's going
[50:51] to happen to them
[50:52] they got to be fed yes that's probably
[50:54] what they're doing now
[50:55] they're feeding them bathing them
[50:58] changing them and that's what God does
[51:00] with me and you but then he says hey
[51:03] let's don't be a 40 year old baby
[51:06] let's don't be a 20 year old baby grow
[51:09] up
[51:10] I have fed you I have clothed you I know
[51:14] this is y'all talking to your kids it's
[51:15] me talking to mine too grow up
[51:19] good job
[51:21] get out of my house
[51:25] seeing you have purified your souls and
[51:27] obeying the truth through the spirit
[51:28] under unfeigned love of the Brethren see
[51:30] that you love one another what with a
[51:32] pure heart what fervently passionately
[51:35] listen we have people that are
[51:37] passionate about everything look go on
[51:38] YouTube
[51:40] you go on YouTube and you look people
[51:42] are passionate about this they're
[51:44] passionate about this they're obsessed
[51:46] with this well I want to be I don't want
[51:48] to be obsessed with God I won't be
[51:50] possessed of God all right listen you're
[51:52] going to be possessed of something one
[51:53] of the two let's just make sure we're
[51:55] possessed by the right spirit
[51:57] today if you're not then we can do
[52:00] something about that
[52:01] Paul Peter says being born again be ing
[52:05] being over and over it's not the new
[52:07] birth you've got to have every time but
[52:09] you got to have a refilling every once
[52:11] in a while of the holy spirit all right
[52:13] being born again not of corruptable seed
[52:16] but of Incorruptible by the word of God
[52:19] which liveth in the Bible forever for
[52:21] All Flesh is grass and the glory of man
[52:23] is the flower of grass the grass withers
[52:25] and the flower followeth away now look
[52:27] all that's human all that's Humanity all
[52:30] that's me and you getting older right
[52:32] but the word of God
[52:34] but the word of God endureth forever so
[52:37] if you get into that you will endure
[52:39] forever and this is the word which by
[52:41] the gospel is preached unto you and and
[52:43] as brother Luke we were talking about
[52:45] yesterday this church has been preached
[52:48] a progressive church it's where we
[52:49] progress we're progressive revelation we
[52:51] we come to a place to where we know that
[52:54] we need more from God not just that God
[52:56] sent us a prophet we don't those days
[52:58] are gone they used to be that day that
[53:00] day back in the 60s when brother Homer
[53:02] and different ones were preaching the
[53:03] word of God God sent a prophet we had to
[53:05] believe that they guide us to Christ but
[53:08] then they introduced The Prophet to us
[53:10] which I I was we were talking about last
[53:12] night
[53:13] and I believe as brother Luke was saying
[53:16] see
[53:17] the people that are leaving the message
[53:19] they're saying well well brother I'm
[53:20] just copied uh Clarence Larkin brother
[53:23] Brown just cop and Nick Clarence Larkin
[53:26] preached a wild horse rider was the
[53:27] Antichrist before brother Brown came on
[53:29] the scene but listen he was a
[53:31] trinitarian
[53:32] so he didn't have all the pieces listen
[53:34] I don't care where brother I my whole
[53:37] sermon come from the prophet's message
[53:39] and the Bible
[53:41] so what's wrong with that that's where
[53:44] you're supposed to get it from but
[53:46] listen Clarence Larkin
[53:48] didn't have a message
[53:52] Clarence Larkin did not have a
[53:53] Vindicated Malachi 4 message
[53:58] all of them were great men lit Dwight
[54:00] Moody different ones
[54:02] gonna be Brown
[54:05] we gotta understand one thing we say
[54:08] we've got this great message and we do
[54:10] but you're going to be a small microcosm
[54:13] of the Bride
[54:15] maybe just a few thousand or maybe even
[54:18] a few hundred thousand everybody else is
[54:20] under Luther Wesley Pentecost
[54:23] the bride for their day
[54:25] that's why they're gonna come to you and
[54:26] say hey man how'd you make it we heard
[54:28] y'all had the worst time
[54:30] we saw well God sent us a prophet
[54:33] to clarify
[54:35] not change
[54:36] to clarify the gospel so that we know
[54:39] what it says and we don't have to worry
[54:41] about like we're going to say here
[54:42] before right in a minute brother Brown
[54:44] says Jesus's first Doctrine watch his
[54:47] first Doctrine was you must
[54:49] not you need to be or you might want to
[54:53] be
[54:53] you must be born again
[54:56] so if Jesus preached his first Doctrine
[54:58] then let that be our first Doctrine
[55:00] you must start somewhere you must be
[55:03] born again now watch
[55:05] till we find out there's so many
[55:07] different meanings that people put to
[55:09] that you must be born again
[55:12] all right some people say You must be in
[55:14] this message no you that ain't true
[55:17] don't get quiet on me that ain't true
[55:20] you must be born again of the holy
[55:23] spirit of God not the spirit of a man
[55:26] that lives down here
[55:29] we find out there's so many different
[55:31] meanings that people put to it the
[55:33] Badness says just come and shake my hand
[55:36] all right uh what do they call it let me
[55:38] make a decision
[55:42] you better make more than one
[55:45] because I've seen many a funeral of a
[55:47] man you never saw in church in the
[55:49] Baptist Church you never saw him live
[55:50] just a hound dog life and they put him
[55:52] in heaven because he he shook a
[55:54] preacher's hand when he was 10 years old
[55:55] no that ain't it people
[55:57] ain't it but that's their part of the
[55:59] being born again
[56:01] amen
[56:02] Luther is justification Wesley preached
[56:06] sanctification but that would even get
[56:08] you and I saved in this day
[56:10] head bye with me nearly all churches say
[56:13] that she must be born again that is a
[56:15] central theme because they can't do away
[56:16] with books John
[56:18] because that's real close to John 3 16.
[56:22] because when Jesus gets finished with
[56:24] that dissertation with Nicodemus what
[56:26] did he say for God so loved the world he
[56:28] gave his only begotten son
[56:30] whosoever believe in him should not
[56:32] perish
[56:33] but have everlasting life
[56:35] that's for everybody
[56:37] that's the Joel 2 he pours out his
[56:39] Spirit upon All Flesh you can receive
[56:41] the Holy Ghost anytime you want to you
[56:43] don't have to be in a church but it's
[56:44] real good place to be
[56:46] I promise you you will be afterwards
[56:49] you might get born again out under a
[56:51] tree somewhere I believe I got born
[56:53] again I was sitting in a motorhome in
[56:55] Kentucky
[56:57] okay
[56:58] but you know what I'm not still sitting
[57:00] in that motorhome in Kentucky I spend 20
[57:02] something years ago all right
[57:05] as brother Luke says and I say and I've
[57:07] many brother Donnie Reagan was preaching
[57:09] on the other night we we spend a lot of
[57:11] time telling people things that if
[57:13] they're born again they should already
[57:14] be doing
[57:15] so why not go back like we're doing and
[57:17] preach people to the new birth and
[57:19] you'll never have to preach about people
[57:21] coming to church
[57:24] a holy ghost person will come to church
[57:26] regardless all right
[57:29] I said regardless amen
[57:32] well praise the Lord the truth anyhow
[57:34] we're getting born again first let's go
[57:37] and get them into church let's get them
[57:38] born again
[57:39] then they'll want to go to church all
[57:41] right that want to will be in there as I
[57:44] said before
[57:46] you can receive the baptism of the Holy
[57:48] Ghost and and it'll transform your life
[57:51] but that won't do away with your
[57:53] problems
[57:54] don't think there's Prosperity Gospel
[57:56] they're preaching out here in the world
[57:57] that you go you know you you get born
[58:00] again under their idea and God's just
[58:03] gonna rain on your uh you know your
[58:06] bills are going to quit coming
[58:08] you'll get you don't have to put that
[58:10] four dollar gas in your car no more just
[58:12] automatically it stays full all the time
[58:15] no you're gonna have problems
[58:18] you're going to have issues
[58:20] but you're gonna know how to get through
[58:22] them you will not know how to get to
[58:25] them without the new birth that's why
[58:26] did you read in the paper the other day
[58:28] suicide in the United States is almost
[58:30] double
[58:31] 50 000 people in this country alone 50
[58:37] 000 that's more than the county you're
[58:39] sitting in
[58:40] Hall County is a big County there's
[58:42] about 60 something thousand people in
[58:44] this County 50 000 people committed
[58:46] suicide last year
[58:49] up some 30 something percent
[58:52] and you know what the whole dissertation
[58:54] was they don't know why
[58:57] I can tell you why
[58:59] ain't got God
[59:01] they don't have a spiritual Rudder they
[59:04] don't have something to turn their boat
[59:07] everybody with me
[59:09] there's different interpretations of
[59:11] what it means to be born again might go
[59:13] to the Methodist Church and say we
[59:14] believe you must be born again how do
[59:16] you interpret that I go to the Baptist
[59:17] Church we believe you must be born again
[59:19] how do you interpret that I go to each
[59:21] church and we'd find if we went to all
[59:22] 900 then was 900 you know there's 13
[59:26] 000 different denominations now in the
[59:28] world that was 969 when brother Bradham
[59:30] was alive in 1965. so you see that
[59:33] didn't stop any denominations that just
[59:35] that the devil just went after him and
[59:37] just had many many more
[59:38] there'd be 900 different interpretations
[59:40] so seeing that there's so many different
[59:42] interpretations and yet a Bible Doctrine
[59:46] so there must be and there's a truth
[59:48] somewhere yes it is so now remember it
[59:51] didn't say you ought to be born again
[59:53] but you must be born again
[59:56] and then he talks about what we're
[59:58] saying in English and look Santa two
[59:59] you're born again and so many different
[1:00:01] interpretations of the word born again
[1:00:03] we ought to seek it out with all our
[1:00:05] heart
[1:00:06] to find what it means and we've been a
[1:00:10] hundred and something sermons trying to
[1:00:11] get us to see if you'll go back to
[1:00:12] number one to about 30. we talked about
[1:00:15] you must be born again but we kind of
[1:00:17] backed up for the new ones that's coming
[1:00:19] we know one thing's for sure that's not
[1:00:21] your new birth
[1:00:23] that's your new birth you're born again
[1:00:26] at Faith we'll talk about this one
[1:00:28] there'll be an anointing right here
[1:00:30] that's going to strike us the church
[1:00:32] everybody but that you got to get born
[1:00:35] again first you got to get in the family
[1:00:37] before you can be adopted you got to be
[1:00:39] in a family before you get any promises
[1:00:41] we'll talk about that in a second
[1:00:44] no matter how much you try to think
[1:00:46] you're right
[1:00:47] saying a Creed joining the church
[1:00:51] this is my idea
[1:00:55] you're still what you were
[1:00:58] until you're actually born again of the
[1:01:00] spirit of God it doesn't change you
[1:01:03] these people are living living the
[1:01:04] message they never were born again they
[1:01:07] just come in Under the
[1:01:09] Umbrella of the anointing that this
[1:01:11] message will give you and you get among
[1:01:13] people and you love people
[1:01:16] but you don't love them with this you're
[1:01:19] loving them with intellect
[1:01:21] if you love them with a pure what heart
[1:01:24] fervently knock this thing right here
[1:01:26] but the heart of you the very soul of
[1:01:27] you
[1:01:28] it doesn't change you your Creed joining
[1:01:30] Church changing your ideas
[1:01:32] are your good intentions
[1:01:35] what's the road to Hell paid with
[1:01:38] good intentions all right although as
[1:01:40] good as it might seem it's still not
[1:01:43] right
[1:01:44] there's something got to happen the new
[1:01:47] birth is an ex let me say it like bro
[1:01:49] Keith reasons unexperience
[1:01:52] he's from Jamaica he was here last week
[1:01:54] so it's an experience he adds that
[1:01:57] little Eerie it's on something that
[1:01:59] takes place yes
[1:02:01] yes I promise you every one of your
[1:02:02] sisters sitting in this building that
[1:02:04] had kids you knew when you had that
[1:02:06] child
[1:02:07] okay that's an experience that's a birth
[1:02:09] so that's an experience same way if
[1:02:11] you're a Christian today you can you can
[1:02:13] pretty much put your finger on the day
[1:02:16] that you got born again
[1:02:18] well if you get quiet on me that means
[1:02:20] you need to get born again
[1:02:24] what brother Dale always tell us all
[1:02:27] those years
[1:02:28] he harped on us and harped on us he said
[1:02:30] I had drether
[1:02:32] seek the baptism of the Holy Ghost every
[1:02:35] day of my life and get to the end of the
[1:02:38] road and know that God said well you got
[1:02:40] it back Yonder
[1:02:41] than to not and sit in a church and die
[1:02:44] and say I'm in the message I don't cut
[1:02:47] my hair I don't I do I don't I do I
[1:02:49] don't I do I don't want to do you're
[1:02:50] going to hell
[1:02:52] if that's all you got
[1:02:54] it that's all you got I'm sorry
[1:02:57] now to begin with to base back the
[1:03:00] reason we have to be born again is
[1:03:02] because the Bible teaches us that we're
[1:03:04] all born in sin all shaped in iniquity
[1:03:07] and come to this world speaking lies and
[1:03:10] then that shows us that our nature to
[1:03:13] begin with is sinful
[1:03:15] okay now listen we know that that we
[1:03:18] hear preachers and we preach ourselves
[1:03:20] too that you have representation there's
[1:03:22] a seed there's a theophany there's a
[1:03:24] part of God there's a a peace of God
[1:03:27] that that you get but you get it at the
[1:03:30] new birth not at your first birth
[1:03:32] if you got it at your first birth you
[1:03:34] wouldn't need a new birth
[1:03:36] pretty simple
[1:03:37] then that shows us that our nature to
[1:03:40] begin with is sinful to start with we're
[1:03:43] no good to begin with so we cannot claim
[1:03:45] anything by our shrewdness
[1:03:48] I can now argue this person knocking out
[1:03:51] argue my neighbor
[1:03:52] no you ought to just love your neighbor
[1:03:55] and let your neighbor ask what you do
[1:03:59] like ours did and for those of you that
[1:04:01] don't know what my our neighbors are gay
[1:04:02] two boys two men
[1:04:04] well they're older men the older than I
[1:04:06] am one of them but anyway they come and
[1:04:08] asking hey what do you believe well
[1:04:09] people in the community never asked us
[1:04:10] that they just assume that we follow man
[1:04:13] he's God he's this he's that we do this
[1:04:15] we do that
[1:04:17] at least they asked
[1:04:20] how great we are how little we are or
[1:04:22] whatever more we are all together wrong
[1:04:24] to begin with so let's just all strip it
[1:04:26] down to the bottom strip it down to the
[1:04:28] wood all right and there's nothing that
[1:04:31] we can do about it except be born again
[1:04:35] Joel 2 28 says I pour out my spirit upon
[1:04:38] All Flesh let's hurry through this I
[1:04:39] want to get to a point Hebrews 9 6 now
[1:04:41] when these things
[1:04:43] where thus ordained the priest went
[1:04:45] always into the first Tabernacle
[1:04:46] accomplishing the service of God he's
[1:04:48] talking about the Old Testament this is
[1:04:50] before the New Birth come and entered
[1:04:53] into a person because remember in the
[1:04:54] Old Testament
[1:04:56] the blood of bulls and goats could not
[1:04:58] take away your sin
[1:05:00] It could only cover your sin until
[1:05:02] Christ come and died to give us eternal
[1:05:05] life is everybody with me all right so
[1:05:07] no new birth in the Old Testament
[1:05:08] because right here it'll explain to you
[1:05:10] the Bible will but into the second went
[1:05:12] to high priest once a year not without
[1:05:15] blood which he offered for himself and
[1:05:17] for the errors of the people now this is
[1:05:19] Bible the Holy Ghost this signifying
[1:05:21] that the way into the holiest of all
[1:05:23] remember he took the blood went in for
[1:05:25] everybody the whole congregation
[1:05:28] now you got to go
[1:05:31] you can't depend on the preacher to go
[1:05:32] for you
[1:05:35] that's a way into the holiest of all was
[1:05:37] not yet made manifest while as the first
[1:05:40] Tabernacle was yet standing and that's
[1:05:43] the Tabernacle the physical Tabernacle
[1:05:45] in the wilderness Jesus tried to get him
[1:05:47] to see that he was the tabernacle they
[1:05:49] tried to guess he to tell him that he
[1:05:50] was the one he was the Lamb of God to
[1:05:52] take away the sin of the world but they
[1:05:54] just wouldn't listen they always fell
[1:05:55] back to the old Tabernacle
[1:05:57] but Christ being coming high priest of
[1:05:59] good things to come by greater and more
[1:06:01] perfect Tabernacle what is it it was his
[1:06:04] flesh
[1:06:05] not made with hands there's a saint not
[1:06:07] of this building neither by the blood of
[1:06:10] goats and cows but by his own blood
[1:06:12] watch he entered in once into the holy
[1:06:14] Place having obtained Eternal Redemption
[1:06:16] for itself
[1:06:19] well be careful amen
[1:06:21] that's no way it says
[1:06:24] he didn't need it we need it
[1:06:27] he did it for us
[1:06:29] he did it for me and you
[1:06:32] so Moses had power and anointing without
[1:06:34] character what brother Ram tell us power
[1:06:37] without character was satanic all right
[1:06:39] David Sampson Abraham Jacob Noah Saul
[1:06:42] Elisha they all had flaws they all had a
[1:06:45] they didn't have a spiritual Rudder
[1:06:47] inside to keep David from killing his
[1:06:49] best friend and committing adultery amen
[1:06:51] but he was the man after God's Own Heart
[1:06:54] because God knew his heart
[1:06:58] Hebrews 11 verse 39 said these all
[1:07:01] brother Luke and brother Bob's been on
[1:07:03] with the book of Hebrews y'all you
[1:07:06] should comb it pretty good brother
[1:07:07] Baldwin on it brother Luke's been on it
[1:07:09] we've been reading so the book of
[1:07:10] Hebrews is a it's a good book
[1:07:13] and I hope y'all understand stood
[1:07:14] yesterday what he was talking about
[1:07:16] the book of Hebrews
[1:07:19] some maybe that didn't
[1:07:21] that's why that Jim says who makes the
[1:07:23] best coffee and he said Wade does
[1:07:24] because Hebrews the coffee
[1:07:27] that's what brother Luke was talking
[1:07:28] about last night so I was going to
[1:07:29] clarify that today
[1:07:31] that Hebrews uh anyway those of you that
[1:07:34] don't drink coffee you can fall asleep
[1:07:36] Hebrews 11 if you drink coffee you
[1:07:38] wouldn't Hebrews 11 39.
[1:07:42] and these all
[1:07:44] having obtained I love it when I love it
[1:07:47] when people are are being are
[1:07:49] interpreting like the brother back there
[1:07:50] all of y'all laughed
[1:07:53] about three seconds later he left
[1:07:54] because Louise had to interpret it and
[1:07:57] send it to him in his earbuds and he
[1:07:58] laughed after y'all did
[1:08:01] so you have to kind of wait you get a
[1:08:02] delayed reaction when you're when people
[1:08:04] are interpreting so and these all having
[1:08:06] obtained a good report I'm just glad
[1:08:08] brother Branham was not from another
[1:08:10] country I'm sorry I'm just glad he was a
[1:08:13] good old Kentucky Angus guy and I
[1:08:15] learned you know that good English and I
[1:08:17] speak it like he does
[1:08:19] but look all these great ones all these
[1:08:21] great warriors all these great people of
[1:08:23] Faith the Great Hall of faith is
[1:08:25] standing there Abraham Isaac Jacob
[1:08:28] Joseph all the different ones in the Old
[1:08:30] Testament they did not receive the
[1:08:33] promise of Genesis 3 15 that I'll put
[1:08:35] enmity in other words I'm going to come
[1:08:37] as God but I'm going to come as human
[1:08:39] and I'm going to die and I'm going to
[1:08:41] redeem this thing back
[1:08:43] he couldn't do it in the Old Testament
[1:08:45] he had to come with himself in flesh and
[1:08:48] die physically for me and you because
[1:08:51] remember Hebrews 11 says all these
[1:08:53] having obtained a good report and I love
[1:08:55] what Paul says he gets finished with all
[1:08:57] this and any interplays because he puts
[1:08:59] it in parentheses he tells all about all
[1:09:02] these Barack and all these different
[1:09:03] ones he said whom the world is not even
[1:09:06] Worthy
[1:09:07] the world at to them the world wasn't
[1:09:11] worthy for them to walk into what Paul
[1:09:12] said but
[1:09:18] they didn't receive the promise
[1:09:20] the promise was the baptism the Holy
[1:09:22] Ghost Acts 2 38. God having provided
[1:09:25] some better thing for us
[1:09:30] not be made perfect so listen to make
[1:09:32] them perfect we've got to become perfect
[1:09:35] first
[1:09:37] I didn't get many amends out of that
[1:09:40] well no you can't because you just said
[1:09:42] you couldn't
[1:09:44] what is your confession
[1:09:46] be therefore perfect
[1:09:48] complete
[1:09:49] as your father in Heaven is complete and
[1:09:51] perfect
[1:09:52] we're never going to be perfect in our
[1:09:54] flesh but if we have a perfect word with
[1:09:56] a perfect god
[1:09:57] with a perfect message
[1:10:00] with a perfect fivefold ministry I'm not
[1:10:02] talking about Humanity
[1:10:04] I'm talking about the gift
[1:10:07] Acts 2 38 says Peter said unto them
[1:10:09] repent any of you that like to be
[1:10:11] baptized repent first
[1:10:14] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:10:16] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:10:18] of your sins and you shall receive the
[1:10:21] what gift of the Holy Ghost what a
[1:10:24] promise for the promise what that
[1:10:26] promise they missed in the Old Testament
[1:10:28] you're you're privileged to that promise
[1:10:32] for the promises unto you to your
[1:10:35] children to all them that are far off
[1:10:37] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[1:10:38] call so that covers all of us all right
[1:10:40] so there's the promise
[1:10:43] now watch this
[1:10:45] brother I'm saying in Blasphemous names
[1:10:46] paragraph 91 said the reason that
[1:10:48] there's so much confusion today
[1:10:52] this was 1962.
[1:10:55] he ain't got much better
[1:10:58] about the holy spirit it's not correctly
[1:11:00] taught
[1:11:02] I believe that the baptism is taught and
[1:11:04] he says they're just saying the baptism
[1:11:06] you know we'll just throw it out there
[1:11:08] but then you like you say automobile
[1:11:10] well there's many of them there's
[1:11:13] Chevrolet Ford Dodge GMC products and
[1:11:16] and all those others but it's an
[1:11:18] automobile but it's many different ones
[1:11:21] but there's got to be one vehicle that
[1:11:23] we get in
[1:11:24] and that's called the new birth and it's
[1:11:26] only come one way that's by you dying
[1:11:30] there's got to be a death
[1:11:32] for you to live
[1:11:34] got several mechanics in the church we
[1:11:36] do too I don't know one thing about it
[1:11:38] neither do I so if I make a mistake
[1:11:40] brother I'm gonna call you I'm not a
[1:11:42] mechanic there has to be calls plugs
[1:11:44] points vowels and everything else listen
[1:11:46] he can quote that but where do they go
[1:11:49] right Donnie would know where they went
[1:11:52] I don't know a thing about electricity
[1:11:53] except one thing call an electrician
[1:11:57] it scares me to death
[1:11:59] my dad in different ones electricians
[1:12:01] they'll just put them Planes together
[1:12:02] and they'll and you'll see a little
[1:12:04] spark or they'll go ouch uh no not this
[1:12:07] boy
[1:12:09] broccoli daddy used to he used to test
[1:12:12] nine volt batteries with his tongue
[1:12:16] to see if they were
[1:12:18] everybody with me
[1:12:21] you know what a nine volt battery it's
[1:12:22] got two it's got two little things well
[1:12:24] he would stick that to his tongue to see
[1:12:27] if they were I said pop let's get a
[1:12:30] battery checker
[1:12:32] well that's okay
[1:12:40] that was his way of doing things
[1:12:42] that's the way it was he'd stick his
[1:12:44] tongue to that thing and he'd go oh this
[1:12:46] was good or no this one's dead
[1:12:50] and when you when you talk about the
[1:12:52] baptism of the Holy Spirit there's a lot
[1:12:54] goes with that
[1:12:56] see there's a lot goes with that and
[1:12:59] here is what I think that God is proving
[1:13:01] is that the holy spirit is here and I
[1:13:03] contend the same thing now Peter said
[1:13:06] first Faith now he keeps going on that
[1:13:08] faith is the foundation faith is your
[1:13:11] new birth everybody with me
[1:13:14] now then that then from this and then
[1:13:17] bringing this into the seven Church ages
[1:13:19] God is building and seven churches abide
[1:13:22] for Christ and you know what we are
[1:13:23] we're the last one we're in the last
[1:13:25] Church age the last body the last bride
[1:13:27] the last people on the face of the Earth
[1:13:29] that's going to get the new birth
[1:13:31] now listen to me the new birth
[1:13:33] because 144 000 they don't get the new
[1:13:36] birth as we do to be bride
[1:13:39] they do get the baptism of the Holy
[1:13:41] Ghost in their soul their own birth but
[1:13:43] it's because they are servants not bride
[1:13:46] all right and they get it after we're
[1:13:48] gone
[1:13:51] there is going to be a door of the
[1:13:53] Gentiles close folks come on
[1:13:56] I don't want to scare you to death but
[1:13:58] the thing is creaking shot
[1:14:02] now look the only way you can be a son
[1:14:04] or daughter of God is because you have
[1:14:06] to have
[1:14:07] eternal life not because you can quote
[1:14:09] unquote have your favorite preacher or
[1:14:11] go to your favorite Church
[1:14:13] and there's only one form of eternal
[1:14:15] life and that's God's own life
[1:14:17] only one form of eternal life that was
[1:14:20] good there to be a Son of God you had to
[1:14:22] be in him always in other words back
[1:14:24] before
[1:14:26] eternity
[1:14:27] brother Brown said
[1:14:29] back in the Eternal before God was God
[1:14:33] what was God's first creation
[1:14:35] God
[1:14:36] what the prophet said figure that one
[1:14:38] out
[1:14:40] only one form of eternal life that was
[1:14:42] God to be a Son of God you had to be in
[1:14:45] him always remember if if you go through
[1:14:48] trials in your life
[1:14:51] and you don't ever say God don't love me
[1:14:55] because God can't change his mind if he
[1:14:58] ever loved you from the beginning of
[1:15:00] time even way past the beginning of time
[1:15:02] if he ever loved you then he can't I
[1:15:05] love you
[1:15:06] now you cannot love him
[1:15:11] but he can never change his mind about
[1:15:13] you
[1:15:14] so if you were in the mind of God if
[1:15:16] you're sitting here today with some kind
[1:15:17] of Sanity in your brain that says I'm
[1:15:20] either lost or found
[1:15:23] we have a lost and found departments
[1:15:24] called The Church

[1:15:30] be born the Son of God you had to be in
[1:15:31] him always the gene of your life now
[1:15:34] look not the gene of this life ever the
[1:15:37] gene of your life comma spiritual life
[1:15:39] tonight or today was in God because
[1:15:43] remember see God can't change he can't
[1:15:45] he can't say oh oh sh oh
[1:15:49] brother George
[1:15:52] I messed up I give him the new birth and
[1:15:55] and he's got problems
[1:15:57] no that's not God God knew he'd have
[1:15:59] problems but he knew he wanted the new
[1:16:01] birth
[1:16:02] that's the way I see God
[1:16:04] he's not worried about your problems
[1:16:07] you say well I've always heard preacher
[1:16:09] say his word yeah he's worried about
[1:16:11] your soul
[1:16:13] you're gonna have human problems till
[1:16:14] your day you die or we leave this place
[1:16:18] because we're Humanity
[1:16:20] but he's interested in your soul brother
[1:16:22] Dale for all these 52 years he's been
[1:16:24] preaching in his church he wants your
[1:16:25] soul he don't care about your body
[1:16:31] he's preaching to your soul how many
[1:16:33] times he told you that
[1:16:35] that's what I'm trying to do preach to
[1:16:36] your soul I'm not preaching whether you
[1:16:38] like me or don't like marriage

[1:16:42] we're only got one service so don't be
[1:16:43] scared if we go past 12 it'll be okay
[1:16:48] the gene of your life spiritual life
[1:16:50] tonight was in God the Father before
[1:16:52] there was even a molecule praise God now
[1:16:55] I believe in internal security that way
[1:17:00] not the way the Baptist did
[1:17:02] shake a hand and then go don't go back
[1:17:04] to church for another 20 something years
[1:17:06] but they'll put you in the as brother
[1:17:08] Dale says they'll put you in the in
[1:17:10] heaven for Paving the parking lot or
[1:17:11] give them some money for an offering or
[1:17:13] you know no
[1:17:15] you are nothing but the manifestation of
[1:17:18] the gene of life that was in God as a
[1:17:21] Son of God now you're expressed after
[1:17:24] his word has come in you so now listen
[1:17:26] if you're going to express his word that
[1:17:29] means you got to do what he says
[1:17:31] you gotta do what the word says you
[1:17:33] can't just be your own Rogue you know
[1:17:34] I'm gonna just go out here and be a
[1:17:35] rogue person you know just no
[1:17:38] you're still a lamb
[1:17:40] you're a herd animal
[1:17:42] and guess what happens
[1:17:44] when you're in a herd what happens
[1:17:48] when one goes away
[1:17:51] the wolf will get that one
[1:17:54] but you stay together you stay
[1:17:56] tight-knit if you'll watch I watch the
[1:17:59] documentary one time about a uh these
[1:18:02] muskox that live in like Sub-Zero
[1:18:04] weather and they have their little kids
[1:18:06] and they birth them one time a year I
[1:18:08] guess when it's warmer
[1:18:10] which is like 40 below zero and then
[1:18:12] here comes a polar bear I mean this
[1:18:14] polar bear is huge and this little bitty
[1:18:17] he gets kind of off away from the herd
[1:18:20] and Buddy here goes the polar bear
[1:18:22] but he forgot
[1:18:24] that Mama and Daddy and a couple other
[1:18:27] mothers
[1:18:28] were standing right over over here
[1:18:30] behind some behind like some snow or
[1:18:33] something
[1:18:33] yeah polar bear figured out real quick
[1:18:35] he better run
[1:18:37] why because
[1:18:39] everybody went after that person that's
[1:18:41] what I say about it we need to go after
[1:18:43] people
[1:18:45] brother Donnie was praying about people
[1:18:46] you start praying about people that are
[1:18:48] not here anymore
[1:18:51] we all got them
[1:18:54] I want him back in the herd
[1:18:57] amen
[1:18:59] and those mothers are them big Ox they
[1:19:02] put that baby in the middle and they
[1:19:04] formed a tight Circle there's no way
[1:19:05] that polar bear is going to get to it
[1:19:07] there's no way the devil is going to get
[1:19:09] to you if you'll do what I tell you to
[1:19:11] do what the Bible tells you to do stay
[1:19:14] in church read your Bible
[1:19:15] Fellowship
[1:19:18] amen that's the only way you're gonna
[1:19:20] make it you cannot make it by yourself
[1:19:24] I didn't say that God did
[1:19:26] and but now the devil would tell you
[1:19:28] different
[1:19:29] oh yeah go you're fine they don't like
[1:19:31] you at that church they don't like you
[1:19:33] but don't you I wouldn't even go back
[1:19:41] if the devil was opening his mouth and
[1:19:42] talking he's lying
[1:19:44] okay if his lips are moving he's lying
[1:19:47] all right
[1:19:49] we need each other that's why brotherly
[1:19:51] kindness is way up here and we've been
[1:19:53] talking about brotherly kindness and
[1:19:54] that's loving your brother
[1:19:57] as you love yourself
[1:19:59] loving your neighbor the two gay guys
[1:20:01] that live beside me I have to and I know
[1:20:03] I do I have to love them the same as I
[1:20:06] love me to be brotherly kindness
[1:20:09] because listen G esus Christ loves you
[1:20:12] when you were unlovable
[1:20:16] gay straight doesn't matter
[1:20:19] that's just a title
[1:20:21] that the devil has given us but we can
[1:20:24] all be saved
[1:20:26] if you'll just give your heart to God
[1:20:30] and there's a way to do it
[1:20:32] there's a way to do it there's a
[1:20:34] required way of doing it and that's
[1:20:35] getting in the Bible get into the
[1:20:37] promises of God and just say hey I don't
[1:20:39] know I don't know why I'm here
[1:20:42] but I'm here
[1:20:45] you'll find out later
[1:20:50] therefore you get what I mean
[1:20:53] you are now made you're sitting in this
[1:20:55] church tonight because your duty watch
[1:20:57] is to express God to this nation
[1:21:01] and this people and this neighborhood
[1:21:04] where you associate
[1:21:07] wherever you are God knew that you would
[1:21:09] be here yes
[1:21:11] because you have to be one of his genes
[1:21:13] or attributes
[1:21:14] now listen I act like my dad and mom
[1:21:18] because that's my genetics physically
[1:21:22] but we ought to act like our father
[1:21:24] Heavenly if we have his genetics
[1:21:29] if you ever if you've got eternal life
[1:21:32] tonight in other words if you've got it
[1:21:33] now
[1:21:35] then it always was eternal life it never
[1:21:37] was a lower form and then became an
[1:21:39] upper for no you were just lost and what
[1:21:41] you were pulled away from it
[1:21:43] by Satan
[1:21:45] God's pulling you back thank God
[1:21:48] it always was eternal life and God
[1:21:50] before there was a foundation World knew
[1:21:53] that you'd be here what for knowledge he
[1:21:55] knew you'd be here
[1:21:57] he knew when he said let there be
[1:22:00] everybody that's sitting here today
[1:22:03] and what you're all thinking
[1:22:09] and when the word or the water the
[1:22:11] washing the water of the word fell upon
[1:22:13] you it was expressed in a being now you
[1:22:15] have fellowship with your father God
[1:22:18] just as you have with your Earthly
[1:22:20] father see you are citizens of the king
[1:22:23] not citizens but you are children Sons
[1:22:25] and Daughters of the Living God if it be
[1:22:28] that eternal life
[1:22:30] dwells in you that's the most important
[1:22:32] thing is to know that you're born again
[1:22:34] or listen it's most important to know
[1:22:36] you're not
[1:22:40] because you can do something about it
[1:22:42] if you want to
[1:22:44] let's look in a book of Ezekiel just for
[1:22:46] a minute
[1:22:49] the Bible tells us Ezekiel says a new
[1:22:51] heart
[1:22:52] well I give you now listen God is a God
[1:22:56] is a master surgeon
[1:22:59] he can change you and never leave a scar
[1:23:01] he can take things out and put things in
[1:23:03] never leave a scar pray to God
[1:23:07] so he's going to give us a new heart
[1:23:08] will I give you and a new spirit will I
[1:23:10] put within you and I will take away the
[1:23:13] Stony heart
[1:23:14] what can you do with a Stony heart you
[1:23:16] can't even live with one
[1:23:19] out of your flesh and I will give you a
[1:23:22] heart of Flesh in other words something
[1:23:23] that's what pliable something God can
[1:23:26] use and look and I will put my spirit
[1:23:29] now that's what I want now he's going to
[1:23:31] give you a new spirit we're going to
[1:23:32] explain it just for a little bit for
[1:23:34] some of the newer ones and I will put my
[1:23:37] spirit now who is my
[1:23:39] God
[1:23:41] that's God Almighty that's eternal life
[1:23:43] God there's not a part of God that's not
[1:23:45] Eternal that's right
[1:23:47] that's right everything he is is
[1:23:48] eternity all right
[1:23:50] and cause you to walk in my statutes and
[1:23:54] you shall keep my judgments and do them
[1:23:59] come Church read the Bible pay tithe all
[1:24:01] that stuff that's easy to do
[1:24:09] get a spattering of amens if you're
[1:24:12] amazed
[1:24:14] but we got to start somewhere so let's
[1:24:16] start just for a few minutes with
[1:24:17] justification
[1:24:19] Romans 5 verse 1 says therefore being
[1:24:22] justified by what
[1:24:24] faith help her get in that door bless
[1:24:26] her heart don't hit that baby
[1:24:29] them babies are gone hey I can put some
[1:24:31] sleep at any age doesn't matter little
[1:24:34] medium
[1:24:36] older gone
[1:24:40] to the letter nod
[1:24:44] when you're good you're good
[1:24:46] therefore being justified by faith we
[1:24:49] have peace with God through our Lord
[1:24:51] Jesus Christ look by whom also we have
[1:24:53] access
[1:24:55] all right he takes out your Stony heart
[1:24:57] puts in a heart of flex he has access to
[1:25:00] be able to deal with you
[1:25:03] we were undealable if that's a word
[1:25:06] did you
[1:25:08] oh I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm preaching to
[1:25:10] Perfect People I keep
[1:25:12] we were lost
[1:25:14] I'm sorry
[1:25:17] I had a conversation one time in times
[1:25:20] past in what
[1:25:21] lust and flesh all of us did you say I
[1:25:25] never did this I never did that Pharisee
[1:25:31] and what did Jesus say to the Pharisee
[1:25:33] you of your okay anyway that's okay
[1:25:36] don't say that therefore be justified by
[1:25:39] faith the whole thing you say well
[1:25:42] what's Faith got to do with it you got
[1:25:44] to believe that God can do it
[1:25:47] you got to believe that God can justify
[1:25:50] you you got to believe that God can wipe
[1:25:52] your sins out and never remember him
[1:25:55] again put a no fishing sign
[1:26:00] what's our problem
[1:26:04] I did this
[1:26:07] I did that and God's going no you didn't
[1:26:10] no you didn't
[1:26:16] but do you really believe that because
[1:26:18] you and I as human beings we can't do
[1:26:20] that I wish we had a sea of God's
[1:26:22] forgetfulness there's one up there
[1:26:25] what
[1:26:27] praise the Lord anyway
[1:26:28] some of the young kids are going what's
[1:26:30] he talking about
[1:26:31] if I remember your name I tell you
[1:26:38] thank God he can't remember but listen
[1:26:41] you got to believe that he can do that
[1:26:43] you got to believe that he is a
[1:26:45] justifier
[1:26:47] and he's so much a justifier he can make
[1:26:50] you just
[1:26:52] even in your lowest estate even in
[1:26:55] justification just when you say God
[1:26:57] forgive me of my sins I am so sorry for
[1:27:00] what I did he's just that he knows your
[1:27:03] heart and if you really want to get rid
[1:27:05] of that thing he'll forgive you
[1:27:08] and listen he'll never remember it again
[1:27:12] but the problem we have is we we need to
[1:27:16] move further
[1:27:18] because the same person that made you do
[1:27:21] all that drinking smoking cussing
[1:27:23] gambling not coming to church whatever
[1:27:27] well had I call it a laundry list we all
[1:27:30] got one just a little different than
[1:27:31] others mine might be socks and yours
[1:27:33] might be shirts but we still had one but
[1:27:37] that person's still in there making you
[1:27:38] do that
[1:27:39] now see God took the Stony heart out and
[1:27:41] he's put a heart in that he can work
[1:27:43] with if you let him
[1:27:44] because what will happen with us is
[1:27:46] we'll we'll be satisfied say oh I have
[1:27:48] this great feeling I feel good
[1:27:51] it must be the Lord
[1:27:52] be careful
[1:27:54] be careful the devil can make you feel
[1:27:56] good
[1:27:58] all right is everybody okay I know it's
[1:28:00] a simple but we're going to preach till
[1:28:01] three or four o'clock we all be used to
[1:28:03] staying here to four anyway so
[1:28:05] we just got four hours left this is the
[1:28:07] four hour battery I just put it in here
[1:28:10] scared people to death when you do that
[1:28:15] you'll be with me won't you bro Michael
[1:28:17] hey I knew he would yeah
[1:28:20] he sits up front where he can get it
[1:28:22] fresh
[1:28:25] that's right
[1:28:27] but we got to believe that God can do
[1:28:29] these things
[1:28:30] we really in our Humanity can't fathom
[1:28:34] somebody not remembering what we did
[1:28:38] because you remember it I drive by
[1:28:40] places hey I still live here
[1:28:42] I drive by places that I did certain
[1:28:44] things
[1:28:46] that I know I did them
[1:28:49] yeah hold on man
[1:28:50] the person I did it with knew I did it
[1:28:52] or the group
[1:28:54] are the one
[1:28:59] I love my wife
[1:29:02] she's so patient with me thank you so
[1:29:04] much I appreciate that
[1:29:06] but we drive by those places and
[1:29:10] Kendrick your mama
[1:29:19] thank the Lord for Grace
[1:29:22] but you go and you do
[1:29:24] you remember things you did you remember
[1:29:26] the places you went to and you know what
[1:29:28] you drive by them and you remember them
[1:29:29] the person you didn't remember you never
[1:29:31] sent a loan the person that you did it
[1:29:33] with
[1:29:34] and the devil
[1:29:37] still remembers it
[1:29:39] but God's going
[1:29:45] what sin are you talking about
[1:29:47] amen I don't ever remember you even
[1:29:49] going to that place
[1:29:51] somebody I don't
[1:29:53] [Applause]
[1:29:58] even say God we serve he can wipe your
[1:30:01] sleigh clean
[1:30:02] you can't do it the devil can't do it
[1:30:05] your mom and daddy can't do it but God
[1:30:07] can do it
[1:30:08] cause he's just yeah he's a justifier
[1:30:13] the Bible tells us to just shall live by
[1:30:16] faith I have to believe that the things
[1:30:19] I did sure I don't do any more but God
[1:30:22] doesn't remember them
[1:30:24] he will not hold it against you ever
[1:30:28] again
[1:30:33] but if you don't continue moving on we
[1:30:35] go to the Book of Luke where it tells us
[1:30:38] that the unclean Spirit goes out
[1:30:41] all right now the one that made you do
[1:30:43] all these things it's leaving you
[1:30:44] because you know what it don't like you
[1:30:46] coming to church
[1:30:48] they don't like you you know there's a
[1:30:49] lot of places we don't like to be
[1:30:51] right
[1:30:53] well that the devil don't want to be
[1:30:55] around it gets kind of hot when God God
[1:30:57] when God shows up it gets a little hot
[1:31:01] I mean everybody thinks Satan is hot no
[1:31:03] he's going to a hot place
[1:31:04] right yeah he's going to a hot place
[1:31:07] there's nothing hard about him he's
[1:31:08] going to a hot place all right
[1:31:11] but he feels that fire god
[1:31:14] moving closer to you
[1:31:16] because remember you were alienated
[1:31:19] from God
[1:31:20] you were a cold stonehearted I don't
[1:31:22] care if you were a kind person you were
[1:31:24] cold and stonehearted before you were
[1:31:26] born again
[1:31:27] that's what the Bible says you have a
[1:31:30] Stony heart so God's going to take that
[1:31:31] Stony heart and give you a heart of
[1:31:33] Flesh where you can work on it
[1:31:35] all right man you need to go to church
[1:31:36] but you remember you're still a free
[1:31:38] moral Asia
[1:31:40] you can accept or reject even sitting
[1:31:42] here today you can accept him reject but
[1:31:44] when you get into the first part of your
[1:31:45] of your Christian Journey it's much more
[1:31:48] well I'm going to say that it is
[1:31:50] important
[1:31:51] that you listen to God that you listen
[1:31:54] to a preacher that you listen to The
[1:31:55] Prophet's message that you read your
[1:31:57] Bible and pray listen
[1:32:01] that section of your life you did
[1:32:03] something before
[1:32:06] me play ball go hunting fishing blah
[1:32:09] blah
[1:32:10] right some went to bars some spit I know
[1:32:13] I got friends of mine they're not
[1:32:14] friends now because they left me but
[1:32:17] they'll go sit in the bar for three
[1:32:19] hours after work
[1:32:22] I like to think that I use my time a lot
[1:32:24] better than being in a bar
[1:32:30] I get some spirit all right but it's not
[1:32:32] in a bar
[1:32:36] you see how it changes your attitude
[1:32:39] but remember if you stay there remember
[1:32:41] that unclean spirit's going to come back
[1:32:45] and it's going to make you worse
[1:32:47] that's why you need to get the Holy
[1:32:48] Ghost and know that you got it know that
[1:32:50] you've had that old thing burned out and
[1:32:52] killed it
[1:32:54] not put it in the closet and get it out
[1:32:56] when you need it that's a problem with
[1:32:58] people leaving this message they just
[1:32:59] put God they just put that old them in
[1:33:01] the closet
[1:33:05] come on somebody you can't turn this
[1:33:07] word down by standing here for all the
[1:33:08] time we've stood here and turn it down
[1:33:11] after 40 years or 50 years you never had
[1:33:13] it to begin with
[1:33:15] John 3 16 said for God so love the whole
[1:33:18] world
[1:33:19] that he gave his only begotten son to
[1:33:20] whosoever believe D in him believeth
[1:33:23] ongoing
[1:33:25] should not perish but have everlasting
[1:33:28] life for God sent not his son into the
[1:33:29] world to condemn the world look but that
[1:33:32] the world through him might be saved the
[1:33:33] world yes if they'll accept him but they
[1:33:36] won't all accept him
[1:33:38] he didn't believeth on him is not
[1:33:39] condemned
[1:33:42] Justified
[1:33:45] but he didn't believeth not is condemned
[1:33:47] already that's right because he hath not
[1:33:49] believed in the name of the only
[1:33:52] begotten Son of God who is what Jesus
[1:33:54] Christ that's why the Bible tells you to
[1:33:56] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:33:58] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[1:34:00] sin I know what Matthew 28 19 says and I
[1:34:03] know that was Jesus talking but you know
[1:34:05] what he was telling exactly what Peter's
[1:34:07] telling around here
[1:34:09] repent
[1:34:11] Jesus said be baptized in the name
[1:34:13] father is not her name son is not her
[1:34:15] name Holy Ghost is not her name it's a
[1:34:18] title to a name I'm a father I'm a son
[1:34:19] I'm a human postal worker preacher
[1:34:23] but my name is Samuel waydale II that's
[1:34:25] how I signed my checks we really don't
[1:34:27] sign checks much anymore but that's the
[1:34:29] way you sign your name on a legal
[1:34:31] document you wouldn't write father
[1:34:34] so you're identified by a name
[1:34:38] I want to be identified that name the
[1:34:40] name of the only begotten Son of God who
[1:34:42] is what Jesus Christ
[1:34:44] pretty simple
[1:34:45] but the world's confounded with it so
[1:34:48] sanctification the Bible says he'll give
[1:34:50] you a new heart
[1:34:51] now remember and put a new spirit in you
[1:34:53] not not the Holy Spirit
[1:34:56] according to the prophet amen and
[1:34:58] according to my life he's not going to
[1:35:01] put the Holy Spirit In My Soul
[1:35:03] until I'm born again
[1:35:06] and then take it out
[1:35:08] he will not he's not an Indian giver
[1:35:10] once he puts that thing in there and
[1:35:12] seals it when God seals it nobody opens
[1:35:15] it
[1:35:16] folks the devil can't even get in there
[1:35:18] as powerful as we try to think he is
[1:35:22] sanctification first Thessalonians 4
[1:35:24] says for this is the will of God
[1:35:26] even your sanctification that you should
[1:35:29] abstain from fornication that every one
[1:35:31] of you should know how to possess his
[1:35:33] vessel and sanctification and honor what
[1:35:36] are you saying brother Wade when you
[1:35:37] come to justification in your walk with
[1:35:39] God and you give your heart to God you
[1:35:41] stand right here You Weep you away as
[1:35:43] they say to the altar which I did
[1:35:45] standing right here give my heart to the
[1:35:48] Lord but the devil's like
[1:35:52] thank you
[1:35:54] come on
[1:35:56] come on don't you remember
[1:36:00] I said yeah I remember
[1:36:02] but God don't
[1:36:05] and I said the things I used to do I do
[1:36:08] them no more you know what though that
[1:36:09] desire was still there
[1:36:12] I used to chew chew tobacco dip stuff
[1:36:16] whatever you want to say
[1:36:17] in general genitalia
[1:36:20] I don't know how she kissed me all those
[1:36:21] years
[1:36:22] I had it in my mouth for so long but
[1:36:25] today God saved my soul
[1:36:28] he Sanctified me from that and never
[1:36:30] again
[1:36:32] have I even wanted to look at it
[1:36:36] do you say well no hold on hold on no no
[1:36:39] no no clap
[1:36:41] well that's just a sign you got born
[1:36:43] again no that's a sign that that unclean
[1:36:45] Spirit left me
[1:36:48] if I don't let it it'll come back cause
[1:36:50] oh listen I'd be lying to tell you that
[1:36:53] they wasn't some temptation
[1:36:58] was there
[1:37:00] but I said nope
[1:37:02] because I knew
[1:37:04] that as you've heard my testimony some
[1:37:07] of you have not that when I came out of
[1:37:09] the water
[1:37:10] when I was re-baptized
[1:37:13] and I came out of the water
[1:37:15] it felt like I was still in the water
[1:37:18] it was raining
[1:37:20] and it was it was flushing and when I
[1:37:23] grabbed June and we were just crying
[1:37:25] like babies together there on the
[1:37:26] riverbank
[1:37:28] I swear I know I'm a young sister swear
[1:37:31] but I'm telling you I felt empty like
[1:37:33] they was absolutely a a drum and at that
[1:37:36] time it was probably pretty bigger the
[1:37:38] nest a 55 gallon drum
[1:37:41] but it was empty
[1:37:43] you said oh God wasn't there you got to
[1:37:45] remember sanctification the unclean
[1:37:47] Spirit goes out
[1:37:48] God's working on you he's working behind
[1:37:51] the scenes but you know what he's doing
[1:37:52] he's seeing what you'll do is this all
[1:37:54] right maybe that's not what I had in my
[1:37:56] sermon but we're good but he's still
[1:37:58] behind the scene
[1:38:00] he's the clean spirit that wants to get
[1:38:03] into inside of your house but he's gonna
[1:38:06] wait right here
[1:38:08] just to see if you'll invite this guy
[1:38:10] back in
[1:38:13] what does the Bible say if you don't in
[1:38:16] other words I'm gonna tell you in my
[1:38:17] language if you don't get it sealed by
[1:38:19] the Holy Ghost
[1:38:25] he goes and taketh seven other spirits
[1:38:29] worse than he was
[1:38:33] right he comes back into your house no
[1:38:35] I'm sorry he didn't say that
[1:38:39] he says
[1:38:41] his house
[1:38:46] then he saith he who's he the devil the
[1:38:49] devil says I will return into my house
[1:38:54] from whence I came out and when he has
[1:38:57] come he finds it empty
[1:38:59] swept and garnished that's okay that's
[1:39:02] good but don't stay there because if you
[1:39:05] stay there he's going to go and take
[1:39:07] seven more and you know what they're
[1:39:09] going to be they're not going to be
[1:39:10] you're not going to be a seven times
[1:39:12] more
[1:39:13] Drinker cusser he's going to bring
[1:39:16] religious guys with him
[1:39:18] he's gonna bring his religious demons
[1:39:19] and say hey this guy thinks he's got it
[1:39:21] y'all come on
[1:39:23] let him sit here for a while let him sit
[1:39:25] somewhere for a while
[1:39:27] then all of a sudden what's going to
[1:39:28] happen they'll lead you back out
[1:39:30] because remember the devil's
[1:39:32] Devil's guide you in all truth who does
[1:39:35] the comforter
[1:39:36] the Holy Ghost will lead you and guide
[1:39:38] you into all truth the devil will not
[1:39:41] then go with him taking themselves seven
[1:39:43] more Spirits more wicked than he is they
[1:39:45] enter in look and dwell there well they
[1:39:47] just sit down
[1:39:49] and the last state of that man is worse
[1:39:51] than the first
[1:39:53] even so shall it be also unto this
[1:39:55] wicked
[1:39:56] generation Jesus is telling us John 17
[1:40:00] he says sanctify them he is he is
[1:40:02] actually he is actually telling he's
[1:40:04] telling the father sanctify them through
[1:40:07] thy truth Thy word is truth how you
[1:40:09] going to get Sanctified by the truth
[1:40:12] as thou has sent me into the world even
[1:40:14] so I have sent them into the oh Lord you
[1:40:18] you should have said I'll take them out
[1:40:20] I'll put them in this little bubble and
[1:40:21] and nothing's going to happen and it's
[1:40:24] all going to be inside we're going to be
[1:40:25] so happy and
[1:40:27] that's not what he's saying he said have
[1:40:29] you as you have sent me into the world
[1:40:31] even so I'm sending them into the world
[1:40:34] and for their sake I sanctify myself
[1:40:36] that they also might be Sanctified
[1:40:38] through the truth
[1:40:41] hmm
[1:40:42] now
[1:40:45] let me read this right here real quick
[1:40:47] everybody with me we all right
[1:40:51] this is what the Bible says First
[1:40:52] Corinthians 6 verse 9. this is Paul
[1:40:54] preaching to the Saints and Lula
[1:41:00] know you not that the unrighteous shall
[1:41:02] not inherit the kingdom of God
[1:41:04] be not deceived
[1:41:07] neither fornicators idolaters adulterers
[1:41:10] a feminate abusers of himself of mankind
[1:41:15] thieves continue Paul preach Covetous
[1:41:18] drunkards revilers extortioners shall
[1:41:22] inherit the kingdom of God you can all
[1:41:23] go home you're going to hell
[1:41:26] that's not what Paul said
[1:41:29] Paul was bringing their mind and he was
[1:41:31] telling them look all of you were this
[1:41:32] and they were all going like this I was
[1:41:34] one of those
[1:41:35] I may have been two or three of those
[1:41:37] okay
[1:41:39] if you weren't then pray for us that
[1:41:41] were
[1:41:42] Paul says and such were some of you
[1:41:46] so that's for some of you
[1:41:48] but
[1:41:49] ye are washed
[1:41:52] I like my brother Louise is preaching
[1:41:54] but God
[1:41:56] but God who is rich in Mercy but
[1:41:59] who now don't remember that list of
[1:42:01] people
[1:42:04] but now you are washed
[1:42:06] you are Sanctified but you're justified
[1:42:08] in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the
[1:42:10] spirit of our god look what he'll do for
[1:42:13] you if you'll just let him
[1:42:17] First Corinthians 15 verse 30. now
[1:42:20] listen we can't get bored again like we
[1:42:21] said we can't take the twins back there
[1:42:22] it's beautiful and nice and pretty as
[1:42:24] they are we can't take them and just
[1:42:26] take them home Michaela takes them home
[1:42:28] she puts them in the closet these are so
[1:42:29] pretty I don't want them to change
[1:42:31] I want them to stay the same I'm not
[1:42:33] going to feed him anymore because
[1:42:34] they'll grow
[1:42:36] they'll die
[1:42:38] they'll die that's the same one with
[1:42:40] your Christianity
[1:42:42] you'll die
[1:42:44] but now watch what Paul says hold on
[1:42:48] and why stand you in Jeopardy every hour
[1:42:52] in other words why are you fussing about
[1:42:55] your problems your issues
[1:43:00] I protest by your rejoicing look though
[1:43:03] which I have in Christ
[1:43:05] oh Christ Jesus I Die daily
[1:43:09] because remember there's a spirit realm
[1:43:11] that the devil can still play in and
[1:43:13] he'll keep popping up every once in a
[1:43:15] while and you got to kill that thing off
[1:43:17] not with spoons and forks
[1:43:20] with a sword
[1:43:21] I protest by your rejoice in which I
[1:43:23] have in Christ Jesus our lord I die
[1:43:26] daily
[1:43:28] all right goodbye with me so now we're
[1:43:30] at the birth which Jesus says I mean the
[1:43:32] Bible says I will put my spirit within
[1:43:34] you I want that my yes I want the spirit
[1:43:38] of God inside of me not on me because
[1:43:40] remember you can be anointed by the Holy
[1:43:43] Ghost
[1:43:45] every day of your life and die and go to
[1:43:47] hell
[1:43:48] that's what the prophet said everybody
[1:43:49] believe brother Byron was a prophet I
[1:43:51] know I want to make sure I'm still in
[1:43:53] the right place
[1:43:55] and I will put my spirit within you and
[1:43:57] cause you to walk in my statutes and you
[1:43:59] shall keep my judgments and do them
[1:44:02] Matthew 3 verse 11 says I indeed baptize
[1:44:04] you with water he's talking about John
[1:44:06] but he that cometh after me is mightier
[1:44:08] than I whose shoes I am not worthy to
[1:44:10] Bear he shall baptize you with the Holy
[1:44:13] Ghost and with fire yes
[1:44:17] John 14 verse 26 but the comforter which
[1:44:20] is the Holy Ghost whom the father will
[1:44:21] send what in my name
[1:44:23] he shall teach you all things and bring
[1:44:26] all things to your remembrance
[1:44:27] whatsoever I have said
[1:44:29] unto you
[1:44:32] how many times you've been thinking on
[1:44:33] something else or be out doing some work
[1:44:35] or something and something brother Dale
[1:44:37] said a year ago
[1:44:38] I'll pop up in your head well you didn't
[1:44:40] need it before now you need it now all
[1:44:42] right because
[1:44:43] it's like I always said before
[1:44:46] out of this sermon you're only going to
[1:44:48] get about 15 minutes of content
[1:44:50] you just better hope it's yours
[1:44:53] you didn't get your neighbors
[1:44:55] Luke 24 verse 39 49 says behold I send
[1:44:58] the promise of the father upon you but
[1:45:01] carry in the city of Jerusalem I want to
[1:45:02] get to this right here
[1:45:04] until you be endued
[1:45:07] now we'll look at that word in dude that
[1:45:09] that word in dude means look in the
[1:45:12] sense of sinking into a garment
[1:45:17] Jesus is telling the disciples
[1:45:20] and behold I send the promise of my
[1:45:22] father upon you but tarry you in the
[1:45:24] city of Jerusalem until you be endued
[1:45:26] with power from on high now we know
[1:45:30] we've been to brother Louise has been
[1:45:31] preached as priests aren't myself about
[1:45:33] um uh um two different kinds of Power
[1:45:36] there's dunamis where we get our word
[1:45:38] Dynamite which is right down here
[1:45:40] dunamis and there's another one called
[1:45:42] extra seal
[1:45:44] or exclusive we'll talk about just that
[1:45:47] because there's two different powers but
[1:45:48] it all comes from the Holy Ghost
[1:45:50] so we talk about here where we see Jesus
[1:45:52] said you're being dude
[1:45:54] you'll be put on or clothed with a raid
[1:45:56] in be clothed to sink into
[1:45:59] listen on the day of Pentecost God just
[1:46:01] didn't anoint them with a little bitty
[1:46:03] flame over the top of their head
[1:46:06] that flame disappeared
[1:46:08] he didn't go back to Heaven either it
[1:46:10] went down in their souls it burned them
[1:46:13] out
[1:46:18] till you be sunk in
[1:46:22] with dunamis
[1:46:25] now look watch this
[1:46:27] this is the difference in the two Powers
[1:46:29] because we're going to see another
[1:46:31] um place where that word's used inherent
[1:46:34] power power residing In A Thing by
[1:46:36] virtue of its nature or which a person
[1:46:39] or thing exerts or puts forth all right
[1:46:41] that's that's dunamis so remember it's
[1:46:44] moral power and Excellence of Soul so
[1:46:46] what what is what is dunamis dunamis
[1:46:49] when they were endued with power from on
[1:46:51] high they received the baptism of the
[1:46:52] Holy Ghost right
[1:46:54] all right everybody stay with me just
[1:46:56] for a minute don't don't go to nod
[1:46:59] Matthew 10 verse 1 is another situation
[1:47:01] though watch this and when he had called
[1:47:04] upon him his 12 disciples he gave them
[1:47:07] power
[1:47:09] now that's different from dunamis
[1:47:12] because dunamis power goes inside of you
[1:47:16] anybody with me
[1:47:18] exosia power is something that God hands
[1:47:21] to him and says here you can use this
[1:47:23] and then it'll be taken away from you
[1:47:26] are an anointing all right he gave them
[1:47:29] power because remember in Matthew 10
[1:47:31] they didn't have the Holy Ghost they had
[1:47:33] not been to the upper room okay but he
[1:47:36] gave them power against unclean spirits
[1:47:38] cast them out heal the manner of
[1:47:40] sickness and all manner of disease now
[1:47:41] that's exosiah which is Authority
[1:47:45] jurisdiction
[1:47:47] gives you libertarian straight Power of
[1:47:49] Choice look Power of Choice
[1:47:55] the power of authority God was giving
[1:47:57] them Authority
[1:47:59] as he gives us Authority by anointings
[1:48:02] as we pray before the service starts we
[1:48:04] pray that brother Joel they'll be an
[1:48:06] anointing on Brother Joseph to to for
[1:48:09] worship
[1:48:10] brother boy different one for worship I
[1:48:12] know they're not going to preach
[1:48:14] but the person is going to preach I pray
[1:48:16] that God gives them an anointing
[1:48:18] looking on in the priest brother around
[1:48:20] him many times he's standing here and
[1:48:21] say now he said I've been preaching he
[1:48:23] said now I'm waiting on him now what was
[1:48:25] he waiting on
[1:48:26] he had the Holy Ghost he had the
[1:48:28] anointing to preach the word of God he
[1:48:30] was waiting on another anointing not
[1:48:31] another person he was waiting on another
[1:48:33] anointing he said I'm waiting on him
[1:48:36] what someone something to come here
[1:48:39] to tell the people the thoughts and
[1:48:41] intents of the heart
[1:48:45] all right
[1:48:48] acts 1 verse 4 it's being assembled
[1:48:50] together with him commanded them that
[1:48:52] they should not depart from Jerusalem
[1:48:53] but wait for the promise of the Father
[1:48:55] which you said you've heard of me we
[1:48:57] just read it for John truly baptized
[1:48:59] with water but you shall be baptized
[1:49:00] with the Holy Ghost not many days hence
[1:49:04] then we continue on but you shall
[1:49:06] receive power look Paul said power after
[1:49:10] listen you're powerless without God Amen
[1:49:13] you may think you got all kind of lists
[1:49:15] and all kind of you know muscles and all
[1:49:17] uh
[1:49:19] you shall receive power dunamis after
[1:49:22] the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[1:49:30] praise God I'm saved
[1:49:33] and say that you 'll be Witnesses
[1:49:36] what is a witness it's something you see
[1:49:38] it's something you were involved in
[1:49:41] you shall be Witnesses unto me both in
[1:49:43] Jerusalem Judea Samaria and Lula Georgia
[1:49:46] the uttermost parts of the Earth
[1:49:50] Acts 2 verse 4 and they were all white
[1:49:53] what not anointed
[1:49:55] anoint the Holy Ghost and began to speak
[1:49:57] with other tongues of the spirit gave
[1:49:59] them utterance Acts 19 verse 1. it came
[1:50:01] to pass it while Apollos was at Corinth
[1:50:04] Paul having passed through the upper
[1:50:06] Coast came to Ephesus in finding certain
[1:50:08] disciples hey certain message believers
[1:50:13] and he said unto them have you received
[1:50:15] the Holy Ghost since you believe and
[1:50:17] they said unto him well it's two Souls
[1:50:19] it's this I've already got that all you
[1:50:21] got to do is believe brother Brown was a
[1:50:23] prophet all you gotta do is do this all
[1:50:24] you gotta do this do this do this or
[1:50:25] this he said if you receive the Holy
[1:50:27] Ghost since you believed
[1:50:29] and they said we don't even know what
[1:50:31] you're talking about
[1:50:33] they weren't taught
[1:50:35] we have not so much as heard
[1:50:38] about this Holy Ghost
[1:50:41] they were preaching what John preached
[1:50:46] John's good John's baptism was okay
[1:50:50] but Paul says it ain't gonna do you any
[1:50:52] good now because you got to further
[1:50:53] Revelation coming
[1:50:56] then Paul said John barely baptized with
[1:50:58] the baptism of repentance saying unto
[1:51:00] the people that they should believe on
[1:51:01] him which should come after him that is
[1:51:03] on Christ Jesus when they heard this
[1:51:07] there was no disputation there was no
[1:51:10] Deacon meeting there was no Minister's
[1:51:13] meeting
[1:51:14] am I making myself clear
[1:51:16] when they heard this
[1:51:18] they were baptized in the name of the
[1:51:20] Lord Jesus and when Paul laid hands on
[1:51:22] them the Holy Ghost came on him and they
[1:51:24] spoke with tongues and prophesied
[1:51:27] Romans 5 verse 5 says hope maketh not a
[1:51:30] shame because the love of God is shed
[1:51:32] abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost
[1:51:34] which is given
[1:51:35] unto us Ephesians 4 verse 29 says let no
[1:51:39] corrupt communication proceed out of
[1:51:41] your mouth but that which is good to the
[1:51:43] use of edifying that it may Minister
[1:51:46] Grace unto the hearer you hear me Grace
[1:51:49] not condemnation Grace
[1:51:52] and grieve not the holy spirit of God
[1:51:54] whereby you are sealed unto the day of
[1:51:57] your Redemption
[1:51:59] let all bitterness wrath anger clamor
[1:52:01] evil speaking evil speaking all this
[1:52:04] virtues
[1:52:06] be put away from you
[1:52:09] with all malice and be your kind one to
[1:52:11] another tenderhearted forgiving one
[1:52:13] another
[1:52:15] I fell forgive me first
[1:52:18] that's not what the Bible says
[1:52:22] do unto others and run that's not what
[1:52:24] the Bible says
[1:52:25] forgiving one another
[1:52:28] Christ's sake forgive
[1:52:29] forgive
[1:52:32] me now listen this brother around lays
[1:52:33] it right here in order just stay with me
[1:52:35] just a minute
[1:52:37] we believe in justification by faith
[1:52:39] Romans 5 1. we believe that after a
[1:52:42] person being justified by faith he has
[1:52:45] peace with the Lord Jesus Christ but
[1:52:47] it's possible that this same person
[1:52:49] could have habits such as drinking
[1:52:51] smoking doing things that he should not
[1:52:53] do filthy habits of the flesh
[1:52:55] doesn't get away don't do away with it
[1:52:57] just chopped off your past sin right
[1:53:00] then if you'll hang around long enough
[1:53:05] then we believe that the blood of Jesus
[1:53:07] Christ sanctifies this person for the
[1:53:10] service of the Lord not put in service
[1:53:12] but for service
[1:53:14] we believe in sanctification according
[1:53:16] to Hebrews 13 12 and 13 where Jesus also
[1:53:19] that he might sanctify the people with
[1:53:21] his own blood suffered without the gate
[1:53:23] and we believe that sanctification is
[1:53:26] taught in the New Testament remember it
[1:53:27] wasn't taught in the Old Testament
[1:53:30] because you couldn't come perfect right
[1:53:32] right only in the New Testament look and
[1:53:35] meant for the Believers through the New
[1:53:38] Testament age which is now which we're
[1:53:41] now living and we also believe that
[1:53:43] after that person has been Sanctified
[1:53:45] unclean habits has gone from that person
[1:53:47] you say well like I said before I know I
[1:53:50] got the Holy Ghost because I quit
[1:53:51] drinking
[1:53:52] no you just got sanctified
[1:53:56] the Holy Ghost will put you in service
[1:53:58] the Holy Ghost will put you read in your
[1:54:01] Bible it'll put you in church it'll put
[1:54:02] you doing the things of God
[1:54:06] he's a Believer on the Lord Jesus and
[1:54:08] his habits are gone this is
[1:54:10] sanctification
[1:54:11] we believe that then he is a candidate
[1:54:17] thank God for a teacher
[1:54:19] we believe that he is a candidate for
[1:54:22] the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:54:24] which comes as a filling
[1:54:27] of the believer
[1:54:29] and then when the Believers just as many
[1:54:31] times as I've taught it like picking up
[1:54:32] a glass in a chicken yard
[1:54:34] justification is picking it up ready to
[1:54:37] use it with a purpose
[1:54:39] that's what God does to the center he's
[1:54:41] still filthy
[1:54:43] then he is cleansed by the blood of
[1:54:45] Jesus Christ and the word sanctifies a
[1:54:47] compound word which means cleaned and
[1:54:48] set aside for service in the Old
[1:54:50] Testament the altar Sanctified The
[1:54:52] Vessel and it was set aside for service
[1:54:54] we believe that the holy spirit is
[1:54:57] putting that same vessel into service
[1:55:00] all right
[1:55:04] let's see what we got here we'll go
[1:55:05] through this
[1:55:07] look right here so the spirit can come
[1:55:09] out here and anoint you to do certain
[1:55:11] things
[1:55:12] all right and you do it but that don't
[1:55:14] mean you're saved
[1:55:18] think of it conference prophesied
[1:55:21] Judas cast out devils
[1:55:24] and I agree with brother Luke last night
[1:55:27] he was talking about there's all been
[1:55:28] spirits of different things going on the
[1:55:30] spirit of Judas because remember the
[1:55:32] juditarian spirit was right there with
[1:55:35] Jesus when he was getting ready to be
[1:55:36] crucified
[1:55:37] so we have a judo Spirit Among Us I
[1:55:41] don't say us but among the message and
[1:55:43] that's why the people are leaving
[1:55:45] they're selling us out and leaving
[1:55:47] they're selling the people that sat here
[1:55:49] for years and years not here but sat in
[1:55:51] their churches for 30 and 40 years and
[1:55:52] heard them preach a message and then now
[1:55:54] they're denying it
[1:55:58] see the spirit anointed him this rain
[1:56:00] falls on the just and the unjust the
[1:56:02] weeds can Rejoice just as much as the
[1:56:04] wheat
[1:56:05] but it's what it is at the core there's
[1:56:09] where you can intellectually can accept
[1:56:11] and say oh sure that's good I believe
[1:56:13] that I still don't do it no sir and the
[1:56:16] spirit can actually make witness of it
[1:56:18] and still It Isn't So
[1:56:20] because if that Soul hasn't come from
[1:56:22] God it can make all the impersonations
[1:56:24] out here but it cannot be real
[1:56:27] you can act healing you can act like you
[1:56:30] have you can act like you receive it
[1:56:32] Christians can act like they're
[1:56:34] Christians
[1:56:35] and act and be ever so good at it but
[1:56:38] that don't mean they're saved that's
[1:56:41] exactly right the spirit can be there
[1:56:43] the real genuine spirit
[1:56:47] the Holy Spirit can anoint you that
[1:56:49] still don't mean you're saved
[1:56:52] it's that inside soul that never dies
[1:56:55] it's got eternal life it always was
[1:56:59] eternal life it came from God it goes to
[1:57:02] God it's your soul
[1:57:05] everybody with me
[1:57:08] you talk about you say well prove that
[1:57:10] Matthew 7 verse 21. not everyone that
[1:57:13] says unto me Lord Lord shall enter into
[1:57:15] the kingdom of heaven
[1:57:17] but he that doeth the will of My Father
[1:57:19] which is in heaven many will say to me
[1:57:22] in that day Lord Lord have we not
[1:57:24] prophesied in your name
[1:57:26] in thy name we've cast out devils
[1:57:29] and in thy name we preach many good
[1:57:31] sermons
[1:57:33] many mighty words
[1:57:35] then I will profess unto them
[1:57:38] I never knew you
[1:57:41] and that word new is the same as if you
[1:57:43] as adults you understand what I'm
[1:57:44] talking about Adam knew his wife Eve
[1:57:47] God is telling us telling that person
[1:57:49] said look I never had an intimate
[1:57:51] relationship with you you never let me
[1:57:53] inside your heart
[1:57:57] wow
[1:57:58] see how this Holy Spirit can anoint a
[1:58:01] man but it's got to be in the order of
[1:58:02] the anointing the outside Spirit can be
[1:58:05] Anointed with the Holy Ghost and the
[1:58:06] Soul as dark as pitch
[1:58:08] false teachers can rise preaching all
[1:58:10] kind of preaching trinitarianism and
[1:58:12] everything else to be Anointed with the
[1:58:14] Holy Ghost and perform
[1:58:16] just as many miracles as the true gospel
[1:58:20] can remember what brother Dale always
[1:58:21] tells us he said I don't care you bring
[1:58:23] a man in here and you put 10 dead bodies
[1:58:25] out here if he raises every one of them
[1:58:27] from the dead he said I still want to
[1:58:28] hear him preach
[1:58:30] and if he's off the word I don't care
[1:58:31] how many people did he
[1:58:33] rages from the dead
[1:58:35] look but by the word here that's what
[1:58:39] does it
[1:58:40] see what I mean
[1:58:42] naughty ones at the end time notice the
[1:58:44] anointing ones only the word will
[1:58:46] separate them so we've come down to
[1:58:47] today that only the truth of the Gospel
[1:58:51] is going to separate all right the word
[1:58:55] will separate them not the signs all
[1:58:58] right now listen
[1:59:00] Shake Yourself just for a minute
[1:59:02] oh no they'll do the same signs
[1:59:07] but it's the word that separates them
[1:59:10] sure they all prophesied they all done
[1:59:13] this that and the other sure just the
[1:59:15] same Jesus said they'd do the same thing
[1:59:17] but the word is what separates them not
[1:59:20] the signs
[1:59:22] we love science but remember science
[1:59:25] does what science follows the believer
[1:59:28] not stays in front signs follow the
[1:59:31] believer back here they follow if you if
[1:59:35] you stay in the true word of God long
[1:59:37] enough
[1:59:37] hey brother Brian said you get under the
[1:59:39] fountain if you want to speak in tongues
[1:59:41] God will let you speak in tongues but so
[1:59:43] will the devil
[1:59:46] you got to know which one
[1:59:49] now let's just talk about this just for
[1:59:50] a minute and then we'll close because we
[1:59:52] got to get to I like what brother Keith
[1:59:54] said Sunday about storms of maturity
[1:59:56] that's what you know you get your birth
[1:59:58] in your birth and I know the two twins
[2:00:00] they they struggled I'm sure
[2:00:03] Michaela did too but they struggled to
[2:00:05] get out
[2:00:08] and now we protect them
[2:00:10] we hold them as babies like God does at
[2:00:13] our new birth he holds us
[2:00:16] but now
[2:00:17] when they get about 15 Mama may want to
[2:00:19] hold them
[2:00:21] but if they big as Aaron
[2:00:23] just saying she's not gonna hold him
[2:00:26] relax she'll want to she loves them but
[2:00:28] she said good job
[2:00:31] get car
[2:00:33] get a life
[2:00:36] right
[2:00:37] so then they're storms of life starts
[2:00:40] your storms as a little child and even
[2:00:43] as a teenager and some of you growing up
[2:00:45] now into adulthood
[2:00:47] we're not preaching everything's gonna
[2:00:49] be roses
[2:00:51] it's a fight but it's worth it
[2:00:54] it's your Eternal destination
[2:00:59] so these storms of maturity
[2:01:01] James 1 verse 2 says my brother
[2:01:03] encountered all joy oh what
[2:01:10] I know people in this world tell them
[2:01:12] bro Luke last night I know people in
[2:01:14] this world I am acquainted with a few
[2:01:17] people in this world that if God changed
[2:01:20] their body back to an 18 year old kid
[2:01:23] they still complain
[2:01:27] people just gonna complain
[2:01:29] if you change their body
[2:01:34] nothing don't hit me like that he says
[2:01:49] count it all joy
[2:01:51] when you fall into diver's Temptations
[2:01:55] why knowing this now that you do know it
[2:01:58] that the trying of your faith
[2:02:01] worketh patience
[2:02:03] but let pay ERS have her perfect
[2:02:05] that you may be perfect in an entire
[2:02:07] wanting nothing
[2:02:09] these
[2:02:11] are not humanly
[2:02:15] possible
[2:02:16] without the new birth
[2:02:19] now yeah you can you can learn to have
[2:02:21] patience you can learn to have knowledge
[2:02:23] you can learn to have temperance
[2:02:26] you can do these self-help things
[2:02:28] I get myself out from right here
[2:02:33] that's my self-help book
[2:02:35] Amber one
[2:02:36] and you know what got to know the author
[2:02:38] pretty well
[2:02:39] so you know what he done he sent me
[2:02:41] somebody to give me the love story to
[2:02:43] tell me what he's saying in between
[2:02:44] these lines
[2:02:46] wow what a mighty God we serve we're
[2:02:49] sister Johnny when you need her I know
[2:02:51] she's watching
[2:02:53] but let patience have a perfect work
[2:02:55] that you may be perfect look entire
[2:02:57] wanting nothing
[2:02:59] all right
[2:03:01] let's look at this just for a second
[2:03:02] there's a metamorphosis that goes on
[2:03:05] from a caterpillar
[2:03:07] everybody knows what a caterpillar is
[2:03:08] right
[2:03:10] why does a caterpillar a caterpillar do
[2:03:12] when the caterpillar matures
[2:03:15] it does what
[2:03:18] it metamorphosis or it changes itself
[2:03:20] into a what
[2:03:22] some of y'all need to go to school
[2:03:25] I learned that in fourth grade
[2:03:27] gracious
[2:03:30] Kendrick didn't say nothing
[2:03:32] um
[2:03:34] but where was the butterfly
[2:03:39] where was the butterfly
[2:03:41] oh it just came from over here and it
[2:03:43] came it was inside of that ugly
[2:03:46] caterpillar the client and the
[2:03:48] caterpillar had to climb up a tree
[2:03:51] right
[2:03:53] turn brown and what
[2:03:55] die
[2:03:59] so that what was inside of it can come
[2:04:01] out
[2:04:02] a metamorphosis that that butterfly was
[2:04:05] always in there
[2:04:08] but he had to work and struggle work and
[2:04:12] struggle and then he had to
[2:04:14] Pop That Old Shell out
[2:04:18] and they become a beautiful butterfly
[2:04:22] that's us
[2:04:26] let's watch this just for a second
[2:04:31] the Lord tells us behold I come as a
[2:04:33] thief
[2:04:35] blessing is he that watcheth and keepeth
[2:04:37] his garments
[2:04:39] lest he walk naked and they see a shame
[2:04:43] and he gathered them together into a
[2:04:46] place called in the Hebrew tongue
[2:04:49] Armageddon everybody understands what
[2:04:51] Armageddon is if you didn't understand
[2:04:52] what brother Keith was saying last
[2:04:54] Sunday
[2:04:55] he was saying Armageddon
[2:04:58] he pronounced it a little bit different
[2:04:59] because he's from Jamaica and he's
[2:05:00] King's English but but he was talking
[2:05:03] about also deity he said deity but it's
[2:05:05] deity when we understand what if he got
[2:05:08] what he was preaching on you'd
[2:05:09] understand what he was saying but he
[2:05:11] gathered him to a place called
[2:05:12] Armageddon now what is Armageddon
[2:05:14] Armageddon is this is what we think
[2:05:16] Armageddon is that great battle way over
[2:05:19] here
[2:05:21] right
[2:05:22] if I read your Bible because I just read
[2:05:24] it there there is going to be a a
[2:05:26] culmination of forces
[2:05:29] but over here on the Earth
[2:05:32] nuclear explosion whatever you want to
[2:05:34] call it
[2:05:36] the only thing is keeping it away is us
[2:05:40] right now
[2:05:41] so what does Armageddon mean
[2:05:43] let's look at just for a second I want
[2:05:45] you to look natural and spiritual just
[2:05:47] for a second
[2:05:49] Armageddon means
[2:05:52] the hill
[2:05:58] the scene of the struggle
[2:06:01] of Good and Evil
[2:06:06] and it's suggested by the battle
[2:06:09] plane of estradon which was famous for
[2:06:11] two great battles Barack over the
[2:06:13] Canaanites and get in over a million
[2:06:15] nights
[2:06:16] for two great disasters the death of
[2:06:19] Saul and Josiah
[2:06:20] sorry Josiah
[2:06:22] we have a josison back there look hence
[2:06:25] in Revelation a place of great Slaughter
[2:06:28] the scene of a terrible
[2:06:30] ocean upon the wicked

[2:06:41] the battle of Armageddon Armageddon
[2:06:43] means the hill now listen watch this

[2:06:48] now the battle started in heaven we all
[2:06:51] know that Shake Yourself got five more
[2:06:52] minutes
[2:06:53] now the battle started in heaven it'll
[2:06:56] be finished on Earth
[2:06:58] now nuclear battle wasn't in heaven
[2:07:03] what was that battle
[2:07:05] it was a spiritual battle between
[2:07:06] Michael and Lucifer
[2:07:09] Michael being who not the one sitting
[2:07:11] back there with a beard
[2:07:14] I had to make that plane
[2:07:16] he probably is fighting Lucifer but so
[2:07:18] are we all
[2:07:20] amen he says
[2:07:22] but you got Michael you got Christ and
[2:07:24] Lucifer fighting a what a spiritual
[2:07:26] battle in heaven they're not up there

[2:07:45] heaven I thought of you when I got them
[2:07:47] actually timu sent me three of them and
[2:07:49] I didn't need but one so
[2:07:51] the Bible started in heaven it'll be
[2:07:54] finished on Earth in the form of that
[2:07:57] battle I just showed you the Battle of
[2:07:58] Good and Evil all right now where is the
[2:08:00] Battle of Good and Evil right now
[2:08:03] you're looking at him I'm looking at it
[2:08:06] it's not out there it's not the
[2:08:08] prostitutes and how many Juke joints and
[2:08:10] how many drunks and not it's between you
[2:08:13] and the devil inside here
[2:08:16] and if we'll let God fight it
[2:08:20] it'll always win
[2:08:22] it'll be finished on Earth in the form
[2:08:25] of Armageddon now let's watch and see it
[2:08:27] unfold and maybe we can unfold it as the
[2:08:30] Lord help us right now to do this watch
[2:08:33] it's on the fourth seal which is the
[2:08:35] battle of Armageddon will not get into
[2:08:36] that too much now what's going to happen
[2:08:37] what's going to happen is the battle of
[2:08:39] Armageddon we're not going to be there
[2:08:40] physically all right look at me and
[2:08:42] we're talking physical you and I will
[2:08:45] not be at the battle of Armageddon all
[2:08:46] right we are fighting our Armageddon
[2:08:49] right now
[2:08:52] right now you're fighting the battle of
[2:08:54] Armageddon right now now listen if
[2:08:57] you're not fighting it inside of you
[2:09:01] you're going to see the other one
[2:09:05] I'm sorry
[2:09:07] people drown it in the flood
[2:09:12] but if you don't have if your battle is
[2:09:14] not one now you will see that other
[2:09:16] battle and you sure don't want to see
[2:09:18] that other battle
[2:09:19] and at that time Michael
[2:09:23] stand up
[2:09:25] shall stand up
[2:09:27] remember what he was preaching last
[2:09:28] night
[2:09:29] there's a time for you to sit down
[2:09:32] there's a time for you to stand up
[2:09:34] there's a time for you to run
[2:09:36] all right so Michael's gonna stand up
[2:09:40] the great Prince which standeth for the
[2:09:42] children of thy people this is what's
[2:09:44] going to actually happen I mean the
[2:09:46] battle of Armageddon is going to be two
[2:09:48] forces opposing forces trying to conquer
[2:09:51] each other to take over the world
[2:09:52] and where's it going to be
[2:09:55] in mcgetto
[2:09:57] nobody with me it'll be in Israel all
[2:10:00] right so we're setting the scene here
[2:10:01] that's where it's all going to culminate
[2:10:03] and the Bible says Michael
[2:10:06] will come down and fight for Israel
[2:10:15] and there shall be a time of trouble
[2:10:16] such as never was since there was a
[2:10:18] nation even to that same time and at
[2:10:21] that time thy people shall be delivered
[2:10:23] who's his people the Jews everyone that
[2:10:25] shall be found written in the book well
[2:10:27] that's me and you too because we're
[2:10:28] spiritual Israel
[2:10:30] all right you ready Victory Day brother
[2:10:32] Ram said we have had many great battles
[2:10:34] spiritual battles all right now listen
[2:10:37] when you got born again that spiritual
[2:10:40] battle is over
[2:10:44] but it puts you on a different field
[2:10:48] of those
[2:10:50] to battle it out until we come to
[2:10:53] because what's going to happen at our
[2:10:55] Armageddon Christ is coming
[2:10:59] what's going to happen to battle over
[2:11:00] there when the battle of Armageddon
[2:11:02] physically starts Christ is going to
[2:11:04] come and fight for him
[2:11:05] we have had many great battles spiritual
[2:11:07] battles many great V days that the
[2:11:09] church has had I mean the church the
[2:11:10] body of Christ I'm not talking about the
[2:11:13] organization now I appreciate what he
[2:11:15] separated there I'm talking about the
[2:11:17] body of Christ the body of Believers

[2:11:21] Victory days in other words we talk
[2:11:24] about we've had several Wars Wars rumors
[2:11:26] of wars v-days V days and B days all
[2:11:29] right and it will finally wind up in the
[2:11:32] great battle of Armageddon that'll be
[2:11:34] the last of it when she comes to the
[2:11:36] battle of Armageddon that'll settle the
[2:11:39] whole thing
[2:11:41] when you come to your battle of arm
[2:11:43] again
