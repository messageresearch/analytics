[21:32] you and the rest of you say brother
[21:36] Colley said he's coming so man remember
[21:41] tomorrow is Memorial Day is for the
[21:44] there was some confusion this morning
[21:47] Memorial Day is not it's not for people
[21:54] that are alive this for the ones that's
[21:55] passed on
[21:57] okay so we're honoring the ones that
[21:59] have given the ultimate sacrifice amen
[22:03] so we thank God that we never had to
[22:08] serve but we thank God that some did
[22:11] Amen right that they did serve and some
[22:14] did give the ultimate sacrifice and I
[22:16] just don't know sometimes I think Nate I
[22:20] don't know I think maybe somewhere
[22:22] there's a place for them I don't know I
[22:23] don't know you know because we send them
[22:26] to war God don't send them to war we
[22:28] said we have a warfare that's not like
[22:30] you said this morning it's not with
[22:31] flesh and blood it's with what we're
[22:33] doing right now this is the greatest
[22:34] battle ever fought the prophet of god
[22:36] said was not out on that battlefield it
[22:38] was right here in the human mind some
[22:40] and that's what we're gonna fight this
[22:41] afternoon we're gonna fight another
[22:42] battle a human battle that is in our
[22:45] mind or a spiritual battle in our mind
[22:47] so remember that also start keeping this
[22:50] in your mind and put it on your calendar
[22:52] August the 7th through the 10th to be
[22:54] the camp meeting coming up that's where
[22:56] brother Joe green and brother Nathanael
[22:58] gets gets all the people from all over
[23:00] the world come in all the missionaries
[23:03] so we try to really support that so keep
[23:05] any prayer that would be all that the
[23:06] 7th through the 10th but the Donnie
[23:09] Regan brother Ron Spencer and Wayne
[23:14] Lawson will be doing the for services so
[23:16] keep them in your prayers and we usually
[23:18] go up on Saturday Friday night and
[23:20] support them so we'll probably the same
[23:21] thing so if you got your Bibles let's
[23:23] turn in the book of revelation 6 this
[23:26] would be the third seal part 2 but we're
[23:27] going to background just a little bit
[23:29] before we continue on I'm enjoying the
[23:35] series I don't know if you or not but
[23:37] I'm enjoying it so it's it's bringing a
[23:40] little more to light things that you see
[23:42] we're talking about the book of Romans
[23:45] downstairs and even today in the book of
[23:47] Romans you know Paul Paul died in 1866
[23:53] that's what men brother Brian was
[23:54] talking about wins now Paul died 1866 he
[23:57] never heard about a seal the seals came
[24:01] to John on Patmos in 1890 something Paul
[24:05] was already dead 30 years before there
[24:08] was a talk of a seal but Paul
[24:10] his writings is exactly talking about
[24:13] the Antichrist about about the mystery
[24:16] of iniquity and about all these things
[24:17] he's actually preaching the seals and
[24:19] doesn't really know but then it took the
[24:21] prophet of God to bring it in the end
[24:24] time and put it all together for us and
[24:26] so that we can have a real clear picture
[24:28] and we can glean out of Romans and
[24:30] Hebrews and all the different writings
[24:32] of Paul the breaking of the seal come in
[24:35] so we just think the Lord that he's
[24:38] allowed us in this end time to see it
[24:41] all see every bit of it the whole book
[24:44] is open there's not a mystery that's not
[24:46] brother branham said the mystery is now
[24:48] history amen and I was telling them this
[24:51] morning we have Satan's answer we have
[24:55] something like Nate was talking about
[24:57] this morning we have something sorry
[24:58] brother Nate that's my boy brother Nate
[25:01] we have something to fight him with we
[25:03] won the battle but we really got to go
[25:05] through I was thinking this morning you
[25:07] know you get out there and fight but but
[25:09] when you come into the adoption stage of
[25:12] the of the part of your journey it's not
[25:15] that Jesus Christ is in your corner if
[25:23] you say to this mountain now I've got to
[25:27] go back and get it from this one Christ
[25:33] is fighting through you and in you well
[25:38] here we go we'll get started revelation
[25:40] 6 verse 5 let's pray before we get
[25:42] started the only father thank you Lord
[25:44] today for this journey that we are on
[25:46] and thank you for the people that you've
[25:49] given us to take this journey with we
[25:51] pray that you would bless them now Lord
[25:53] and you be the active participant in
[25:55] this service you be the speaker you be
[25:57] the hear you be the one Lord that gives
[26:00] revelation because without you here
[26:02] today it would just be a meeting of
[26:03] minds we pray Lord that you would just
[26:06] bless the ones that are sick that you
[26:07] will take care of them Lord today even
[26:09] as we speak be with the missionaries on
[26:11] the foreign fields give them fruit for
[26:13] their labor father just be with each one
[26:15] people brother Nate and sister Caitlyn
[26:17] now they've started their journey Lord
[26:20] in life and now with brother Nate
[26:21] standing with the sword with him we
[26:24] we've sure pray Lord that you just
[26:26] protect him and keep him safe and just
[26:29] may sister Caitlin be a true support I
[26:30] believe she is so give her strength to
[26:33] Lord because when when you choose the
[26:35] man you choose the woman to go with him
[26:38] so god bless them all Lord we thank you
[26:41] for all the things you've given us thank
[26:43] you for this day and giving us our daily
[26:46] bread
[26:46] in Jesus name we pray amen revelation 6
[26:50] verse 5 when he had opened the third
[26:52] seal I heard the third beast say come
[26:53] and see and I'll be holding a lo a black
[26:56] horse and him that sat on him had a pair
[26:58] of balances in his hand and I heard a
[27:00] voice in the midst of the four beasts
[27:02] saying I remember this is a part that
[27:04] has not been through the first two seals
[27:07] there's not been an extra voice it's the
[27:10] combat beasts saying come and see
[27:12] combat beasts they come and see well the
[27:14] combat beasts which the third beast the
[27:16] man will talk about in a minute
[27:18] says come and see and then you see
[27:20] something extra that's why I tell you
[27:22] the the third seal is very very
[27:24] important for us to get what this third
[27:27] seal is all about and not the seal but
[27:29] the Thunder we believe in preaching the
[27:33] thunders in this church I we never all
[27:35] you all know that and I heard a voice in
[27:37] the midst of the four beasts so there
[27:40] was another voice there was someone
[27:42] stepped out and said don't you hurt the
[27:46] old and whine amen and we know who that
[27:48] was that was the Lamb himself so you may
[27:50] be seasoned the Lord had his blessing to
[27:52] the reading of the word and as we get
[27:54] help brother than to get the chart out
[27:55] here we will begin our study here on the
[28:00] on the third seal and
[28:09] give you a little visual again
[28:11] background a little bit for Nate and
[28:14] Caitlyn before they go to sleep we'll
[28:15] talk about them yeah Oh keep saying
[28:21] things that way I'm sorry keep thinking
[28:24] out loud again I told Bob if he'd set up
[28:26] here in the front he might get something
[28:27] to look at that he's alright fire falls
[28:32] in front done brother dick
[28:33] hey man first three ropes at least there
[28:39] you go okay make it plain four five six
[28:44] they just keep going on back all right
[28:47] so now in the opening of these seals and
[28:49] bring up the other one I'm gonna have to
[28:50] background a little bit for our visitors
[28:54] because we've read this quote how many
[28:56] for three months
[28:57] so this quote is a me quote it's the
[29:00] brother Dale quote so you're not gonna
[29:02] find this in the message but I believe
[29:03] it's all in the message okay because the
[29:06] seals are not the Antichrist is such and
[29:09] such and so and so we were looking at
[29:11] before and for those of you that haven't
[29:13] been here this was what the book was
[29:15] sealed with him and the book was sealed
[29:18] with seven seals not a book like this it
[29:20] was a scroll and then it was a scroll
[29:24] and was sealed with seven seals and then
[29:25] when the seal was tore back the problem
[29:29] we have in the message is we we take too
[29:33] much time on this but remember what the
[29:40] prophet of God said he said the seals
[29:42] and the thunders are two different
[29:44] things
[29:45] the seal was what had it sealed up but
[29:50] when that seal was broke this is not
[29:53] what we're supposed to read this has
[29:57] already been revealed and we can let it
[30:01] ride off because it rode off right horse
[30:05] white horse red horse black horse I want
[30:08] to know what the Thunderer says
[30:09] underneath that seal hey man I don't
[30:11] want to know what's gon happen I didn't
[30:13] find one with some quotes on it this one
[30:14] you usually have some with quotes on it
[30:16] but you brought my horse back don't
[30:19] bring my seal back the one thing away
[30:21] but that's what we want to say we sure
[30:24] we took a profit to guard to open the
[30:26] seals but he said it'll be those seven
[30:28] unknown thunders that'll wake the bride
[30:31] up amen
[30:33] and it will what it will give us rapture
[30:37] in faith not the seal not the seal but
[30:41] the seal has to be tore off in order for
[30:44] us to see what was underneath it hey man
[30:47] because remember brother Branham
[30:49] preached to seals in 1963 and we were we
[30:51] were we quoted it the other day where
[30:53] brother Branham told him on the on the
[30:56] questions and answers after seal number
[30:58] six he said you're not getting it it's
[31:01] not for you in other words there's
[31:04] something going on but you're not
[31:05] catching it and he told the people he
[31:08] said you're not supposed to get it he
[31:11] said but now putting another quote
[31:13] together right around the coming of the
[31:15] Lord all these things are going to be
[31:16] put back together and I think we're
[31:19] right around to coming over Lord amen
[31:22] so we're need we need to understand not
[31:24] that the seal is a wild horse ready show
[31:25] hold on I got a quote so look the
[31:29] breaking of the seals then is not
[31:30] necessarily for your soul I hope we're
[31:34] getting something now that we're really
[31:35] trying to get the people to understand
[31:38] how we compartmentalize take the soul if
[31:42] it's born again it can't be improved on
[31:47] you can't make eternal more eternal amen
[31:52] you can't if you're born again you have
[31:56] the very soul of God in you today that's
[32:02] why they brother Dale there's many
[32:03] people that are truly not born again
[32:06] they have an anointing on their second
[32:09] realm that tells them by Satan that
[32:14] you're what you're okay you're sitting
[32:16] in the message church you may get up and
[32:17] you may do this and you know you may
[32:19] shout a little bit and I thought we were
[32:21] in Jamaica a few minutes ago when we
[32:23] were singing that song man had a bee
[32:25] didn't it if we'd a been Jamaica if I
[32:27] looked at that window they'd have been
[32:29] about 40 people doing this but I guess
[32:32] we're just I'm
[32:36] maybe we'll catch it one day but anyway
[32:39] so then as we compartmentalize this
[32:42] thing then you got to take the flesh out
[32:44] of the way we were talking about this
[32:46] this morning
[32:47] your flesh don'ts in this flat listen
[32:53] can you see this
[32:54] your flesh never seen today in this life
[32:56] whoo
[32:58] we get in somewhere it's a product of
[33:01] sin and it's in a fallen condition
[33:04] because it came the wrong way through
[33:06] mom and daddy but it's not sinful you
[33:11] say well prove this let me prove it to
[33:13] you
[33:13] because somebody will go well no I know
[33:16] you've sinned in your flesh your flesh
[33:19] doesn't sin you've sinned in your flesh
[33:23] right your flesh what Jesus told him
[33:27] because before then the priest could say
[33:30] I have not touched that woman so I have
[33:33] not committed adultery touched that
[33:35] woman but Jesus told him what'd he say
[33:38] he said whatever you think you don't
[33:42] think will you flesh he said whatever
[33:44] you what you look on a woman to lust
[33:47] after her
[33:49] you have committed adultery with her
[33:51] already you never touched her with this
[33:53] so what it is it's in that spirit realm
[33:59] Amen it's in that spirit realm that God
[34:03] is trying to work on from the inside if
[34:05] he's in there if it's not it's just
[34:08] devil devil devil and then to me this is
[34:13] what the seals makes them so much plain
[34:14] in Ephesians that the word is a divider
[34:17] of the soul in the spirit and then the
[34:21] joint in the marrow in other words it
[34:22] pulls everything apart but it's totally
[34:24] one unit I can't have a soul without
[34:27] having a spirit it can't have a spirit
[34:29] how much soul but now I don't have a
[34:30] soul without having a flesh body if I
[34:33] die and go to a grave that's not a flesh
[34:36] body but I'm going to connect back to
[34:38] this thing right here
[34:41] right here I'm not getting to knew what
[34:45] I'm getting this one redeemed because
[34:47] redemption is not replacement hey man
[34:50] I'm telling you when you see the break
[34:53] into these seals correct you cannot
[34:55] preach false doctrine
[34:56] you can't did Jesus preach false
[35:00] doctrine he preached the seals his whole
[35:03] life his whole life where's the Thunder
[35:06] underneath those cells I am the way the
[35:12] truth in the life amen
[35:15] so the breaking of the seal is not
[35:16] necessarily for the soul because the
[35:18] soul is redeemed by the new birth like I
[35:19] said Paul never heard about the breaking
[35:22] of seal one two three four five six
[35:24] seven yet he was a born-again prophet of
[35:26] God so we must take that out of the way
[35:30] and say well this the seals doesn't does
[35:32] not it's not dependent to be a Christian
[35:37] to know the seals you don't have to be a
[35:40] Christian you have to be a Christian to
[35:42] be a Christian and as a Christian as we
[35:45] are in this end time as being Christians
[35:48] in this day I'm come by sitting right
[35:50] here today it is a requirement that we
[35:54] know what those virtues are how they're
[35:57] placed and what do they do with these
[36:00] seals and what does those seals have to
[36:02] do with you and then but your soul is
[36:05] redeemed by the new birth shed blood of
[36:06] Jesus Christ John 3:16 and then but when
[36:10] you're born again go see Martin Luther
[36:13] you know conclude by the seal why say
[36:16] didn't have a clue let me play it back
[36:17] he probably didn't study him enough to
[36:19] even worry about him so that wasn't his
[36:21] time his time was the just shall live by
[36:25] faith
[36:26] a little bit of light but listen a
[36:29] little bit of light of God is eternal so
[36:35] we had a little bit of light and then
[36:38] John Wesley had a little bit of light
[36:40] Pentecostals had a little bit of light
[36:41] but you and I have the full book open
[36:44] and then we have the full book but what
[36:48] will it do knowing these seals knowing
[36:50] what's underneath those seals will
[36:53] in full fellowship in the manifestation
[36:55] because God could not fellowship with
[36:58] Martin Luther like he wanted how can God
[37:01] fellowship with a father son Holy Ghost
[37:03] baptism can't do it how can God
[37:07] fellowship with a eternal hell
[37:10] and all those things that Martin Luther
[37:12] brought out of the Catholic Church but
[37:13] yet God said all I want you to do Martin
[37:17] Luther is to preach to just show there
[37:20] by faith I want you to get those people
[37:22] out of that denomination
[37:25] gettime out of that system with penance
[37:30] and like we were talking like we're
[37:31] talking about here with the balances and
[37:33] all with the novenas get him out of that
[37:35] but he didn't get him all the way out
[37:38] and then never brother Brown says he
[37:41] said they had a little white couldn't
[37:42] get all the way out they had a little
[37:43] light couldn't get all the way out they
[37:44] men in the church ages but this age
[37:47] there's no eighth church age we're
[37:51] either going in the ground or we're
[37:53] going up and man there's not another
[37:55] church age for us to throw this to so we
[37:57] have to learn and I promise you if you
[38:01] got the Holy Ghost in your soul don't
[38:02] tell me your Holy Ghost in the soul does
[38:03] not want to learn more of God it's an
[38:10] impossibility now it is a possibility
[38:13] that you can what in your spirit realm
[38:17] you can say that's enough doors in doors
[38:22] brother Bram preach doors in doors as
[38:24] you let Christ in your house you keep
[38:27] that door shut he won't go in that door
[38:30] cuz the Holy Ghost is a gentleman like I
[38:32] said before Nate if that was me and you
[38:34] though we'd be going what's behind that
[38:35] door right but the Holy Ghost won't do
[38:40] that he's a gentleman but you know what
[38:43] if you'll go over let's say God I got a
[38:45] problem behind this door I hear that
[38:48] I've got a problem I'm opening it up you
[38:50] know what he'll step in and take care of
[38:52] it cuz he promised like brother Nate
[38:54] would say there's more there's promises
[38:55] in the Bible that he will fulfill if you
[38:59] ask him
[39:01] just like you go back to where the the
[39:04] boy that shot the guy and they went to
[39:06] the puck got the pardon a pardon it's
[39:08] not a pardon
[39:10] unless it's accepted as a pardon amen
[39:14] but these sales will bring full
[39:16] fellowship back in the manifestation so
[39:18] that God can fellowship with us just
[39:20] like you fellowship with Adam in the
[39:21] Garden of Eden hey man you know what we
[39:23] want we want more fellowship with God
[39:26] all right so have more fellowship with
[39:28] God then we must learn these things that
[39:31] have a little bit of teaching have some
[39:33] preach and have some fivefold ministry
[39:34] to where they can teach us these things
[39:38] and it'll make the picture more clear
[39:43] because the pictures there and then
[39:46] remember even brother Branham said the
[39:48] picture you can have the grass and the
[39:50] cow and the tree that's the picture but
[39:55] if the cows in the top of the three
[39:57] eaten grass the pictures there but it's
[40:00] wrong
[40:01] the cow needs to be down here well then
[40:03] it takes a minister or somebody with a
[40:05] little bit of a gift to bring that cow
[40:07] out of the tree and put him in the grass
[40:08] and man so that's what we're dealing
[40:11] with now I think is worth as brother
[40:13] Branham I told you last Sunday as
[40:15] brother Branham come to tie up the loose
[40:18] ends coming from the denominational
[40:21] world bringing tying up the loose ends
[40:23] and bringing us into the message I
[40:27] contend that God is now using us us the
[40:33] fivefold ministry around the world to
[40:34] tithe to loosen that got unraveled from
[40:38] 1965 to today so this message is a mess
[40:45] to some people
[40:47] it is a mess age but you know what there
[40:52] if there is a mess there's a truth they
[40:58] man and I contend that we have the truth
[41:01] amen
[41:03] I contend that we have the truth and can
[41:06] see this picture all this statue of a
[41:09] perfect man that's it's not it's not
[41:11] needed
[41:11] brother Brown said power without
[41:14] character it's satanic right
[41:17] so if you have power but you don't have
[41:20] them virtues to work through you I'm
[41:23] just telling you what he says don't
[41:25] don't get mad at me I'm gonna telling
[41:26] you what brother Graham said he said
[41:28] power without without character satanic
[41:33] those virtues not used correct as the
[41:35] stumbling block to the believer and I've
[41:38] seen it you've seen it a man so the
[41:40] quote is very much true so let's read
[41:43] the first couple of quotes here I got to
[41:46] go back to this one give a little
[41:47] background from from a little buddy back
[41:50] then from natives we can not fall asleep
[41:52] on me
[41:53] 1961 Revelation chapter 5 see what it's
[41:58] doing it's these seals opening up just
[42:00] beginning to reveal the plan of
[42:02] redemption not the plan of the devil
[42:05] everybody goes home horse rider that's
[42:07] that's Antichrist that's the opening of
[42:09] the seal that's the tearing off of the
[42:11] seal and then we as message believers we
[42:15] start following that know it's what's
[42:17] underneath it's the Thunder is what's
[42:20] going to wake us up I read you closing a
[42:21] minute where brother Bobby said the
[42:23] bride hadn't had a revival but it'll
[42:26] take those seven unknown thunders to
[42:28] wake her up you know I tell I told you
[42:32] before we look at the seven seals as
[42:36] revealing the devil brother upsets us to
[42:39] plan a Redemption the plan of redemption
[42:43] which brings what brings back what has
[42:45] failed
[42:46] all right the plan of redemption how he
[42:48] did it it's all over now just about just
[42:52] about finished up so we're at the end
[42:53] time so that's why the things are being
[42:55] revealed go to number two this one I
[42:59] like because it's in the breech
[43:01] now remember what I told you happen in
[43:02] the breach right because God's got to
[43:06] change the womb of our mind we were
[43:10] having a breech baby feet first I
[43:13] thought was this that and the other but
[43:17] God had to reach in the womb of our mind
[43:19] and turn that baby around so that the
[43:21] head could come because the Christ the
[43:23] head is Christ he's the one that's got
[43:25] to be here he's the one that breaks the
[43:27] seal and then now when we go to breaking
[43:30] these seals you're gonna see it goes
[43:32] plumb back in the scripture all the way
[43:34] back for each one of these seals the
[43:36] whole thing together the whole mystery
[43:39] lays right here in these seals not only
[43:44] in every mystery of the Bible lays in
[43:48] these seals and the seal cannot be
[43:51] broken until that time I'll prove it
[43:52] here just in the man notice the book
[43:54] remember it's sealed here's one here's
[43:56] this seal then another one's wrapped a
[43:58] seal another one that brother branham is
[44:00] making mention of the rolling of the
[44:03] scroll right everybody got that same am
[44:07] but look it's a book of redemption the
[44:14] whole thing together makes the book and
[44:16] it's sealed with seven seals and being
[44:18] us on the backside is because it's wound
[44:20] up the seal mystery is on the inside not
[44:26] on the seal inside all right
[44:30] because watch what he says and it only
[44:33] says the wild horse rider or the black
[44:35] horse rider want more on the outside but
[44:37] the mystery of the whole book is in
[44:40] themselves from Genesis to Revelation a
[44:43] complete plan of redemption is revealed
[44:45] in these seven seals so it's not the
[44:48] seal sure the seals why had it sealed he
[44:51] had to be tore off it took a prophet to
[44:53] tear it off the Christ through the
[44:55] Prophet toward the seal off but what was
[44:57] behind the seal is what we need just
[45:00] doing wireless routers Antichrist we
[45:03] should have took a rapture in 1963 it's
[45:07] been 50 something years and we're still
[45:10] walking around horrible why because we
[45:12] ain't got the mystery
[45:14] the thunder the voice of God wind the
[45:17] seal breaks and you said what is the
[45:20] thunder john saw john solemn so they not
[45:26] too mysterious john saw him without
[45:29] brother branham being here hey man he
[45:33] didn't have a problem writing him cuz he
[45:35] was getting ready to ride him down and
[45:36] God said stop not time for that
[45:40] John said would you told me to write
[45:42] everything I saw right remember he was
[45:44] commissioned to write not interpret
[45:46] right he was commissioned to write
[45:47] everything he saw he was getting ready
[45:49] to write we remember read revelations 10
[45:51] 1 through 7 and as John was beginning to
[45:54] write what the mighty angel said no stop
[45:59] don't write it John seal it up why go
[46:03] there wasn't time because you and I
[46:04] weren't there I'm telling you this whole
[46:07] thing hinges on who's sitting in this
[46:09] building and around this world right now
[46:11] that are true believers this whole thing
[46:14] this whole thing hinges on us I told you
[46:21] the right player we've got the right
[46:23] play we've got the right player we've
[46:25] got the right conductor we've got the
[46:27] right instruments it's all here it's
[46:30] here so then we must see this complete
[46:34] plan of redemption we've always seen for
[46:38] the Soul Paul James John they didn't
[46:46] have a seal book they didn't even have a
[46:51] Matthew Mark Luke and John book they
[46:55] just believe what Jesus said
[47:00] be here we've got all this information
[47:03] and look what kind of mess we got we got
[47:05] all these 1,100 sermons we've got all
[47:07] these and I've been using downstairs I
[47:11] brought out my emphatic dog lot and I
[47:12] like to have because that's the that's
[47:14] the real come from the Catholic Church
[47:16] but it was a Latin Vulgate and it was
[47:18] the real transcript and you can read
[47:20] that and get a little more information I
[47:22] like all these translations but unless
[47:24] God puts it together for you and reveals
[47:25] it to you not me
[47:27] you told him downstairs this morning
[47:30] listen if you don't get anything else
[47:31] dos break into the seals has to be an
[47:34] individual affair with God has to be you
[47:37] God has to bring it through me brother
[47:41] Dale it doesn't matter just don't even
[47:42] put a name in there but you're the one
[47:45] that's gonna have to receive it and did
[47:48] what make it live back out hey man
[47:51] that's the hard part making it live back
[47:54] out so now we see that to break into
[47:58] these seals then John solemn was getting
[48:00] ready to ride him what did John see he
[48:06] saw the full plan of redemption because
[48:11] there is no one Thunder Revelation
[48:14] chapter 24 verse 1 does not say the
[48:18] first under says there is nowhere in the
[48:19] Bible that's my brother branham's didn't
[48:21] know where no Bible you're going to find
[48:22] the seven thunders but if it don't
[48:25] compare from Genesis to revelations so
[48:28] it's got to be in there somewhere
[48:29] and John didn't have a problem beginning
[48:32] to write it that's why I'm telling you
[48:33] it's not so mysterious that John but
[48:37] remember what is John got in common with
[48:41] me and you there was only one thing
[48:43] because he never had our mess into the
[48:44] hour he barely listened to Paul had a
[48:49] little bit Irina's but he never had a
[48:52] messenger to tell him what these are
[48:55] John saw the full plan of redemption
[49:01] that's why he could understand didn't
[49:04] get ready to write it so the thunders
[49:06] are some you know the people in the
[49:07] message that made it polygamy they made
[49:08] it seven men they made it this they made
[49:10] it that it's just the continuation of
[49:13] the simple plan of redemption amen
[49:16] it is what I'm going to read it to you a
[49:18] few minutes we read it last Sunday where
[49:20] brother man said it was there was a
[49:21] mysterious part of justification a
[49:25] mysterious part of sanctification and
[49:28] then let's skip that and go to number
[49:31] four and let's read that I was going to
[49:34] go through now remember to as we go
[49:36] through this we remember the property
[49:41] God was in the seventy weeks of Daniel
[49:43] the six fold purpose there's six there's
[49:46] a six fold purpose that redeems Israel
[49:49] all right there's a six fold purpose
[49:51] that redeems israel brings them from
[49:53] lost to save three two prophets when we
[49:59] get out of here that god's gonna go to
[50:00] them they're gonna get the baptism of
[50:02] the holy ghost in their soul they're
[50:04] gonna receive jesus christ and they're
[50:06] gonna take a rapture a man right just
[50:12] like you and i did so they get six fold
[50:15] purpose to complete their redemption we
[50:18] get six seals because remember six seals
[50:20] finishes redemption not seven hey man
[50:24] right sick cells finishes redemption
[50:27] seventh there's nothing there
[50:30] where'd that come from there's nothing
[50:32] there
[50:33] silence in heaven one through six
[50:36] there's things happen that things went
[50:38] on that's what we've been talking about
[50:40] so as six seals finishes our redemption
[50:43] the six fold purpose of Daniel seven new
[50:45] weeks finishes the Jews Redemption and
[50:47] we'll get into that next Sunday I'm
[50:49] going to cut some of that out but let's
[50:51] read the third seal here and now we find
[50:54] out that these mysteries I've already
[50:56] been no longer in here then this morning
[50:57] I get his hour I told Dobrin eight I
[51:02] said you know what I said they want an
[51:04] hour and a half a daddy this morning I
[51:06] said they're fishing to get an hour and
[51:07] a half for you I said what are you gonna
[51:08] do about it so I preached 35 minutes so
[51:12] anyway now we find
[51:14] out that's good that's good he did a
[51:16] good job today I'm telling you he knows
[51:18] I told him he did a real good job I sent
[51:20] his daddy attacks and told about you'd
[51:22] be proud of it and now he's on the
[51:24] Internet
[51:24] so y'all may never see him again okay
[51:30] let's going no I don't think that's
[51:32] gonna happen you guys start really
[51:36] laying this clothes out for him and now
[51:39] we find out because she doesn't and now
[51:41] we've hot that these sales are supposed
[51:44] to be revealed so listen let's get back
[51:46] to a point I'm sorry our point is there
[51:48] is a revelation of something that
[51:50] previously was not known and now it's
[51:52] all coming to light we've got enough of
[51:56] this information revelation and we
[51:59] bringing it together and we're gonna see
[52:02] the complete plan of redemption because
[52:05] we're gonna stand on this earth with a
[52:08] glorified body in this dimension amen
[52:13] that's what I'm looking for that he
[52:15] fills every fiber of my being with that
[52:18] Holy Ghost that I've kept down in my
[52:20] soul and I let him out just every once
[52:23] in a while because he has to filter
[52:27] through the spirit realm and Satan
[52:29] filters through the spirit realm and
[52:31] that's where they meet the greatest
[52:32] battle ever fought brother Graham said
[52:33] it's not in your heart it's in your mind
[52:37] remember Satan chose the mind God chose
[52:39] a heart they see their faith their doubt
[52:41] in the heart but it's all different kind
[52:43] of five different things memory reads
[52:44] the conscience affection imagination is
[52:46] right up here the battleground is right
[52:48] here and why didn't these other men
[52:51] Wesley Luther those great reformers who
[52:54] brought out justification sanctification
[52:55] in the Pentecostal age with the baptism
[52:57] of the Holy Spirit and things
[52:59] why didn't he catch these missed
[53:01] messages why didn't they get them
[53:04] because they were reformers no brother
[53:05] that was gonna cover that more he's been
[53:08] covering it now for a couple of Sundays
[53:10] they were reformers because they
[53:13] couldn't get it they couldn't get
[53:15] everything out and they couldn't get
[53:16] everything settled okay because you
[53:19] can't have restoration sure you start
[53:22] restoration with with Martin Luther and
[53:24] different ones you start that but they
[53:26] didn't fully restore
[53:28] we were stored it's not a father son
[53:30] Holy Ghost baptism I keep going to that
[53:33] because that's the most common thing you
[53:34] know father son Holy Ghost baptism
[53:36] Trinitarian doctrine they'll fight you
[53:38] for that now in the denominational world
[53:40] and in them and in the message they'll
[53:42] give you a good Tunis doctrine amen to
[53:46] Lourdes do this do that amen
[53:53] there's only one true Living God a man
[53:58] and if you're a second person that's
[54:04] what I'm telling you most of us in our
[54:07] mind in the womb of our mind it's God in
[54:10] us separate that can't happen
[54:16] that can't happen and that ain't the way
[54:19] God wanted it Adam and Eve were one you
[54:24] read oneness with God brother Brian said
[54:25] Adam and Eve and God in the garden was
[54:28] true one that's now if we walked up on
[54:30] that conversation we'd see how many
[54:31] three he said that was true oneness was
[54:36] God and Adam and Eve in full fellowship
[54:38] together when we see the bride in the
[54:40] new city that bride will be one mrs.
[54:44] Jesus Christ
[54:45] one person many membered body but one
[54:49] person and then just like take it on the
[54:51] other side there was people come in who
[54:53] was had power as kings but wasn't king
[54:56] see now watch he already talked about
[54:58] rolling back he already talked about
[55:01] Luther and Wesley under justification
[55:04] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[55:05] Ghost
[55:05] right now scroll oh my god or down just
[55:11] like take it on the other side that was
[55:12] people come in who had powers kings and
[55:14] Kings you have to notice the Bible
[55:16] terminology of anything and then now
[55:19] watch but these the reason that all
[55:21] these stray ends of the mysterious part
[55:25] about justification those remember as
[55:29] we've been preaching look over here me
[55:30] forget that look at me
[55:32] thank you justification baby form
[55:36] justification chopped off your past sins
[55:38] right now that justification will take
[55:42] you on to glorification if you continue
[55:44] on but if you stop that unclean spirit
[55:47] is still in your soul
[55:49] it's just chopping off your past sin you
[55:52] keep sinning the root of evil I'm
[55:54] quoting the Prophet the root of evil is
[55:56] still there and then but now this
[55:59] justification we're talking about in the
[56:01] in the seals is not baby form
[56:04] justification it's a justification that
[56:07] you didn't do it
[56:08] the real unit and do it and you got to
[56:11] realize not just quoted Amen what sins
[56:16] are you talking about we got to realize
[56:19] that that thing that is inside of us son
[56:21] cause of the theme because the Bible
[56:23] called it thing colder than it - yeah
[56:26] that thing that'll be in you that the
[56:30] Holy Ghost will write so that thing
[56:33] inside of you is so powerful if you're
[56:36] born again today you're already
[56:38] glorified amen
[56:41] you don't have a bad thought in your
[56:45] soul amen
[56:47] God never had one it's just as eternal
[56:53] it's not just as the eternal is gone it
[56:55] is gone hey man that's what we gotta say
[56:58] it is God it's not God coming talking to
[57:01] a sign talking to a spirit talking to
[57:03] you
[57:03] [Laughter]
[57:06] please brother Brown said it's God and
[57:10] you in there as persons and you can't
[57:12] divide them you can't separate them once
[57:17] God has filled you with the Holy Ghost
[57:20] he there is no way he can separate from
[57:24] you no way that's what I was telling you
[57:28] the the greatest revit one of the
[57:29] greatest revelation is I first got Nate
[57:32] was that I don't have to stand judgment
[57:35] talking about a weight lifter talking
[57:38] about I mean you realize that cuz if
[57:42] you're not born again today and you die
[57:44] you got to go to the white throne and be
[57:47] judged by your works
[57:50] your dues and your domes I don't ever
[57:54] want to be judged even right now by my
[57:58] do's and don'ts I put everything that
[57:59] Christ has done it off if he made it I
[58:03] made it that's why he came but he didn't
[58:09] come sure he come to clean the soul up
[58:11] and put himself in but that's not all he
[58:14] wants that's not all he wants he wants
[58:18] complete preeminence then when your hand
[58:21] moves God hand moved when you speak it's
[58:24] not speaking in a third person it's not
[58:26] thinking in a second person it is the
[58:29] person speaking
[58:34] that wasn't William Branham the human
[58:38] that created squirrel it was God in
[58:43] William Brennan that he yielded itself
[58:45] so much oh if we could just get that but
[58:50] we're not gonna get much when they'll
[58:52] hurry up the mysterious part of
[58:54] justification is that if those who is
[58:56] justified he is all ready glorified
[58:59] you're just as eternal as God is doesn't
[59:03] matter if we preach your funeral
[59:04] tomorrow
[59:05] it ain't your soul we're talking to but
[59:10] I contend I'm a we until that happens we
[59:15] which are alive and remain to the coming
[59:19] of the Lord shall not prevent our what
[59:21] hinder that's our problem right now
[59:24] we're hindering we're hindering the
[59:29] resurrection called it's not here and
[59:32] the only reason that's going to come
[59:34] here is because we say whatever you say
[59:40] the only mountain we got left is death
[59:44] that's the only mountain we got left
[59:47] there's death and when that's destroyed
[59:50] and it will be by the Word of God and it
[59:54] ain't gonna be a bunch of people either
[59:56] it may just be a few but I contend I'm
[1:00:00] one of the field
[1:00:04] until I get proven different I'm saying
[1:00:06] I'm one of the field you should say the
[1:00:09] same thing the mistake of remember he
[1:00:12] can only go by your what confession
[1:00:17] so let's confess that this thing's going
[1:00:22] to be over when we say it's over and
[1:00:25] that's not making us some big something
[1:00:26] no that's God speaking to you today a
[1:00:31] mysterious part of justification we
[1:00:33] played long enough listen hair dress and
[1:00:35] all that stuff that's good
[1:00:36] I y'all heard me meantime but listen
[1:00:39] brother Brahim didn't come to bring us
[1:00:40] hair and dress he did not come to bring
[1:00:44] us a hole in this life no way that was
[1:00:48] not his message that message was
[1:00:51] preached a long time ago that message
[1:00:52] was in the Bible the Nazarenes lived a
[1:00:55] better life than he did he said okay
[1:00:59] somebody blow something up back there it
[1:01:05] Oh in the media room oh boy
[1:01:08] y'all be careful back there I think I'll
[1:01:14] stop and have a drink man are we good
[1:01:20] now okay huh
[1:01:22] everybody okay back there okay brother
[1:01:25] Anderson's there we good okay there's no
[1:01:28] smoke maybe that was a thunder who knows
[1:01:35] the mysterious part of justification
[1:01:37] listen the mysterious part of
[1:01:38] justification is this that you're
[1:01:41] already glorified we're already risen
[1:01:44] sitting in heavenly places that's what
[1:01:46] the Bible says the light brother Dale's
[1:01:49] always said back to brother Browning's
[1:01:51] message was not in the years of
[1:01:53] preparation he said that I've got the
[1:01:56] quotes I got him right back in there he
[1:01:57] said not during the healing campaign not
[1:02:00] during the first part that was just
[1:02:02] debate on the hook his message was these
[1:02:05] seals that were trying by the grace of
[1:02:08] God to help everybody see that was his
[1:02:11] message that was the seventh pain
[1:02:13] those message was not herring dress and
[1:02:16] we heard it for years but I promise you
[1:02:19] we didn't preach the new birthright
[1:02:22] that's why we had to preach on hair and
[1:02:24] dress right because if you get a woman
[1:02:28] born a brother mom said you can't get a
[1:02:29] Holy Ghost field woman to put on a pair
[1:02:31] of pants you can't get a Holy Ghost
[1:02:33] field woman to cut her hair well then
[1:02:35] why preach on it
[1:02:36] get her born-again then you ain't got
[1:02:38] preach on it the more we are standing on
[1:02:48] the edge of something that man has never
[1:02:53] before attained to Kosair was not not
[1:02:59] enough belief there was not enough
[1:03:02] people to stand in front of them every
[1:03:04] Sunday and say you can do it I'll fly
[1:03:09] away Oh glory when I die hallelujah by
[1:03:12] and by that's okay for them they didn't
[1:03:15] mean that's not my confession brother
[1:03:21] Graham said deaths gonna come up your
[1:03:22] sleeve one day and what you gonna do
[1:03:24] brush it right off that's powerful
[1:03:26] people because the only reason those
[1:03:29] people in that six dimension don't come
[1:03:31] in this dimension is why one thing
[1:03:32] there's no death in that dimension and
[1:03:34] there's death in this dimension when
[1:03:36] death is destroyed in this dimension by
[1:03:38] the opening of the sealed by the
[1:03:39] thunders what not the thunders just
[1:03:42] sounding know it living out to somebody
[1:03:45] thousands of live voice --is and God
[1:03:49] will back up what we say because it
[1:03:51] won't be us it'll be him talking through
[1:03:53] us amen
[1:03:56] the mysterious part of sanctification
[1:03:59] not that you were just cleaned and set
[1:04:01] aside for service because remember Satan
[1:04:03] can get back in in baby form
[1:04:06] sanctification Satan can come right back
[1:04:08] in the unclean spirit goes out of a man
[1:04:09] walking and dry plates us seeks ravenous
[1:04:12] nun right that's what the Bible says but
[1:04:15] he comes back finds the house swept and
[1:04:19] garnished bring seven more of his
[1:04:22] friends more evil than him are more
[1:04:26] just than him put you in the message for
[1:04:30] you and tells you you're fine that's
[1:04:37] exactly what he does but when he comes
[1:04:40] back and finds the power of the Holy
[1:04:42] Ghost in that vessel he can't get back
[1:04:45] in there no more but eating war he can
[1:04:48] work on that second realm he said well
[1:04:50] I'll give him in his spirit because I
[1:04:54] can still get in there but this part of
[1:04:57] sanctification the mysterious part of
[1:04:59] sanctification is just you're so clean
[1:05:01] and set aside brother Brown said Satan
[1:05:03] don't know what to do with you we're not
[1:05:09] going out of here with false doctrine
[1:05:11] it's all got to be 100% the truth you
[1:05:15] said what are you saying brother wait
[1:05:16] somebody's got to have it somebody's
[1:05:21] gotta have it and you know what it's not
[1:05:23] just somebody's got to have it
[1:05:24] somebody's got to believe it and live it
[1:05:31] the mysterious part of the baptism of
[1:05:33] Holy Ghost
[1:05:34] what is it mysterious part of the whole
[1:05:35] ego that he can change your body who you
[1:05:42] think's gonna change you buddy you are
[1:05:44] know we tried for years we tried for
[1:05:46] years we put on we put well some of us
[1:05:49] can put things in our hair in everybody
[1:05:59] but we've tried our best and it's okay
[1:06:02] to take vitamins I do it's okay to do
[1:06:04] these things but it's nothing doing that
[1:06:07] your spirituality could be zero and you
[1:06:09] could look like Arnold Schwarzenegger
[1:06:10] and man and you know what Arnold
[1:06:14] Schwarzenegger's died think I mean yeah
[1:06:17] he's 70 something years old if time goes
[1:06:19] on you're gonna die I don't want that no
[1:06:22] I want that inside man don't keep
[1:06:24] working his way out
[1:06:28] our problem is we don't give him enough
[1:06:31] room to work
[1:06:32] amen everybody goes a man specially
[1:06:36] those that are asleep tried to get him
[1:06:41] forth to go to land a nod but sometimes
[1:06:43] they go home anyway but the mysterious
[1:06:45] part of the baptism the Holy Ghost is
[1:06:47] you already got it
[1:06:48] you got what you need he just needs
[1:06:53] something to work on something to work
[1:06:56] with that's why like brother Nate said
[1:07:00] this morning the foolishness of
[1:07:01] preaching you've got to have a fivefold
[1:07:04] ministry you've got to have a preacher
[1:07:05] in this dimension say no more but anyway
[1:07:17] so it's the mysterious part of
[1:07:19] justification the mysterious part of
[1:07:20] sanctification mysterious part of the
[1:07:22] baptism the Holy Ghost that's what we're
[1:07:24] coming and facing now not just that
[1:07:26] we're born again and everything's good
[1:07:29] you know like the analogy I told about
[1:07:31] the bitkeeper
[1:07:32] you know we got a little big keeper man
[1:07:34] and he just wants three beehives and
[1:07:36] that's all he wants he likes to watch
[1:07:37] the bees go in and out get a little bit
[1:07:39] of honey but there's others want more
[1:07:42] but you got to start with the same house
[1:07:45] but what you do is you learn to expand
[1:07:47] what you got somebody getting something
[1:07:50] from there you got to learn to expand
[1:07:52] what you got what you got to read you
[1:07:53] got to study
[1:07:55] you got to pray and read your Bible but
[1:07:58] if you want to be a good bee keeper a
[1:07:59] better bee keeper you got to pray and
[1:08:01] read your Bible pray they don't sting
[1:08:03] you and that's the same thing with
[1:08:07] anything that's why we were talking this
[1:08:08] morning in Romans the first chapter God
[1:08:12] tells us that we can understand the
[1:08:14] Godhead by the things we see and there's
[1:08:18] no other way we're going to understand
[1:08:20] God except this way because you know
[1:08:23] what he didn't go oops I think let's try
[1:08:25] this subject no no God's ways the first
[1:08:29] way and that's the only way he saw
[1:08:31] somebody get it
[1:08:33] mahalo room did you know what spit on
[1:08:37] you but he saw somebody did it the way
[1:08:40] he preached it hey man so that's the way
[1:08:44] we're just gonna have to get it whether
[1:08:45] we like it or not but I kind of like it
[1:08:48] look number five so there's a mysterious
[1:08:50] part so there's a mysterious part that
[1:08:53] we haven't seen third seal now that's
[1:08:58] what the reason today the revivals were
[1:09:00] not supposed to have
[1:09:01] we have denominational revival I mean
[1:09:03] we're supposed to have we haven't had a
[1:09:07] real stirring no no no no no sir don't
[1:09:12] think we got revivals we have it this is
[1:09:14] 1963 the third seal the one that we're
[1:09:16] talking about right now all right
[1:09:18] don't think we got revivals we haven't
[1:09:20] oh they've got millions and millions and
[1:09:21] millions of church members this message
[1:09:27] has got millions of people in them
[1:09:34] church members but not a revival no
[1:09:39] where no no the bride hasn't had a
[1:09:42] revival yet see there's been no revival
[1:09:45] there no manifestation of God you think
[1:09:49] William Branham have you went crazy what
[1:09:52] do you mean no manifestation you've
[1:09:54] raised so many dead there's been 10,000
[1:09:57] people 200,000 people healed at one time
[1:09:59] or 200,000 people come to Christ 10,000
[1:10:02] people you know 15 or 20 been
[1:10:04] resurrected from the dead in this
[1:10:07] ministry and he's telling you there's no
[1:10:08] manifestations of God to stir the bride
[1:10:10] yet that don't stir the bride because
[1:10:15] you can get this thing all worked up and
[1:10:19] be dead as a hammer in this hole and
[1:10:22] then no manifestation of God to stir the
[1:10:26] bride yet see we're looking for it it
[1:10:29] will take those seven unknown thunders
[1:10:32] back there to wake her up again now
[1:10:35] what's going to wake us up more than
[1:10:37] anything the plan of redemption is what
[1:10:40] you and I need now you put everything
[1:10:43] you won't do in that but we need
[1:10:45] the plan of redemption that's already
[1:10:48] placed in the Bible we just got to pull
[1:10:55] it out we just gotta get it we just
[1:10:58] gotta get it out so that we can what use
[1:11:00] it exercise our faith and then Paul said
[1:11:07] exercise the gift that's been given you
[1:11:09] what not exercise this way no read study
[1:11:14] go church all right now we've come to
[1:11:19] this part and let's look just for a
[1:11:21] minute at the seal that we got to Sunday
[1:11:27] till I'm on I want to read one more
[1:11:29] thing before we go and then we'll kind
[1:11:31] of cut it off right here and we'll start
[1:11:33] a little bit more next Sunday and when
[1:11:35] he had opened the third seal I heard the
[1:11:36] third beast say come and see
[1:11:37] now what is the third beast all right
[1:11:41] you ready what is the third beast the
[1:11:44] man amen the first beast the lion
[1:11:48] ox man and eagle right the lion ox man
[1:11:53] an eagle so the lion was the first
[1:11:54] Street Church ages that wild horse rider
[1:11:57] the red horse rider was in we have
[1:12:00] overlaps the third fourth and fifth and
[1:12:02] then the man anointing was the fourth
[1:12:05] fifth and sixth age why coming out of
[1:12:07] the Dark Ages into the age of what man's
[1:12:10] intelligence books were put together
[1:12:13] Martin Luther John Wesley people started
[1:12:16] putting things together Tyndale and all
[1:12:18] those ones started bringing things
[1:12:20] together but like I said before this is
[1:12:23] an important seal because it's a black
[1:12:27] horse but there was a voice protecting
[1:12:35] something of that seal that's what it
[1:12:40] says there was never another voice
[1:12:41] there's only one vote one time a voice
[1:12:44] speaks out and says a measure of wheat
[1:12:46] for a penny three measures of barley for
[1:12:47] a penny see thou hurt not the oil and
[1:12:50] the wine all right so the third beast
[1:12:52] then is the man anointing so it's demand
[1:12:55] the intelligence not the intelligence of
[1:12:57] man to put a bomb together to blow
[1:12:59] you know we have to have an intelligence
[1:13:03] even in this pyramid this knowledge
[1:13:05] right here is not man's knowledge that
[1:13:07] knowledge is the knowledge of the
[1:13:09] Almighty God
[1:13:10] the one that created the world if he's
[1:13:13] inside of you don't you think somewhere
[1:13:15] down the line you and I are gonna start
[1:13:17] thinking like he things hey man I can
[1:13:24] understand that Bible more now why the
[1:13:27] man that wrote it is inside of me
[1:13:29] looking through my eyes Pelin
[1:13:33] showing me what showing me what he wrote
[1:13:36] the love letter think of it the man that
[1:13:45] pushed the button Big Bang Theory if you
[1:13:50] won't do but had to be somebody push a
[1:13:53] button that same man is pushing your
[1:13:55] button today alright we're going we're
[1:14:05] going to find out one day where we
[1:14:07] really have come through life even in
[1:14:09] the message and be a second person
[1:14:12] [Music]
[1:14:14] brother it ain't gonna happen you got to
[1:14:18] know that your God made manifest in
[1:14:20] another form believe it and manifest it
[1:14:25] you know what go that's not what I said
[1:14:27] that's what the Bible's already said
[1:14:32] Jesus said the world will see me no more
[1:14:36] but you'll see me cuz I'll be with you
[1:14:41] even in you because God hides himself in
[1:14:49] this simplicity right here and by all
[1:14:57] rights a man so we got to bring these
[1:14:59] things because remember in the Garden of
[1:15:01] Eden that's what a problem is Adam said
[1:15:03] I was afraid
[1:15:08] something separated him from God what
[1:15:11] now what is the plan of redemption pull
[1:15:16] it right back to where when Adam called
[1:15:19] an elephant an elephant
[1:15:20] God didn't say Adam you shouldn't have
[1:15:22] done that he said I don't that's exactly
[1:15:26] what I was thinking and it become an
[1:15:29] elephant for eternity and Adam named
[1:15:32] them all you'll see someone of these
[1:15:36] days I hope all right
[1:15:39] so the third beast was the man anointing
[1:15:41] witches covers the part of the fourth
[1:15:44] fifth and sixth and even part of the
[1:15:45] seventh age because remember as we
[1:15:48] realize now that the fourth field the
[1:15:51] rapture takes place on the fourth seal
[1:15:53] right what's prophecy because the Holy
[1:15:59] Ghost is gone the line arts man and
[1:16:01] Eagle which will be the next seal the
[1:16:03] fourth seal we cover after the fourth
[1:16:05] seal you don't see a line knocks man an
[1:16:06] eagle that is the Holy Ghost into
[1:16:08] believer
[1:16:09] hey brother branham said it disappears
[1:16:11] why it takes a rapture amen
[1:16:15] till the rapture takes place on the
[1:16:17] fourth seal but in the seven churches
[1:16:18] that makes people go crazy but it's real
[1:16:20] very simple right there it is the first
[1:16:24] seal is these first three ages the
[1:16:27] second seal is these third seal is this
[1:16:28] before seal this and then we go into
[1:16:30] rapture there's no way Church age and
[1:16:34] there's no tribulation for a believer
[1:16:38] and no judgment man that still makes me
[1:16:41] feel great so you got the line ox man
[1:16:46] and then we come here we are at the man
[1:16:47] then you got the white horse rider now
[1:16:49] the wild horse rider was white it was a
[1:16:51] white righteous church the mystery the
[1:16:55] man of sin the mystery of iniquity where
[1:16:57] he didn't attach itself to the bar rooms
[1:17:00] and the prostitution hall that wild
[1:17:03] horse rider Satan riding that white
[1:17:05] horse attached himself to the white
[1:17:07] righteous church that was already on the
[1:17:10] earth because remember Satan is a white
[1:17:13] copycat Satan is not an originator so
[1:17:17] there had to be by the law of contrast
[1:17:20] there had to
[1:17:20] be a white righteous church on the earth
[1:17:23] to Satan to try to work through and then
[1:17:27] and then he comes and gets on a red
[1:17:30] horse which is coming into the Dark Ages
[1:17:34] we showed it the other day 606 ad Nicaea
[1:17:37] comes in and brings the doctrine in and
[1:17:39] that doctrine literally killed 68
[1:17:43] million people lot of red that horse the
[1:17:47] Prophet said rode right through that
[1:17:48] blood of those martyrs that was
[1:17:50] Christians supposed killing Christians
[1:17:54] Satan does not we look at him way out
[1:17:59] yonder somewhere the Bible says we're
[1:18:01] going to walk by one day and say is that
[1:18:03] the man right in Ezekiel I believe it it
[1:18:08] is that the man ERISA is that the man
[1:18:10] that brought nations to their knees
[1:18:12] water no SOT drunk linen laying in them
[1:18:14] his own puke that's the devil so he's
[1:18:19] not an originator so when he gets on a
[1:18:21] horse and rides God's already there
[1:18:24] God's already doing the work hey Manny
[1:18:27] will we're only 18 and you know what
[1:18:32] brother Nate when you put their hands up
[1:18:35] like this and God's not behind you he's
[1:18:37] in you
[1:18:41] Satan's already defeated he just don't
[1:18:43] know it because the four knowledge that
[1:18:46] God is now your foreknowledge write that
[1:18:50] down you need to use it it's your it's
[1:18:52] the foreknowledge of God that tells you
[1:18:53] you've already won five but you still
[1:18:58] you can't just go now Satan I think I'll
[1:18:59] just fight you like this no he'll hit
[1:19:01] you pretty hard but when you put all
[1:19:03] that up I'm gonna have another message
[1:19:07] on that thing that's pretty good hey
[1:19:09] there good job this morning again he did
[1:19:11] a good job
[1:19:11] I love these young preachers coming in
[1:19:13] yet they have a zeal and you know they
[1:19:16] give this a little life in the blood you
[1:19:18] know but the red horse those people in
[1:19:22] that Dark Age all they done was said
[1:19:26] there were Christians and they got
[1:19:27] killed that ox anointing that real slow
[1:19:30] but I was telling them brother Nate
[1:19:32] listen to this now
[1:19:34] a lion when it's born drinks milk the
[1:19:39] sincere milk of the word we like milk in
[1:19:41] this church but I don't like milk all
[1:19:45] the time but the lion starts out
[1:19:48] drinking milk but he becomes a what a
[1:19:50] meat-eater
[1:19:51] and then the Ox stewart's out drinking
[1:19:56] milk is a baby and eats grass not a lot
[1:19:59] of power to that but they made it
[1:20:01] through the man the man starts out to
[1:20:05] his life drinking milk a man don't feed
[1:20:09] a baby a steak when it's don't feed
[1:20:11] Khloe steak please don't she barely just
[1:20:15] put a bottle in her little mouth but you
[1:20:17] know what you start with a bottle so we
[1:20:19] start with milk milk milk but now the
[1:20:22] Eagle never drinks milk but what does
[1:20:28] mama Eagle do mama Eagle chews up the
[1:20:30] big pieces of meat so she wants so that
[1:20:32] babies won't choke she chews it five
[1:20:36] times apostle profits
[1:20:38] pastors teachers and evangelists that's
[1:20:43] all right Regina that all right that
[1:20:45] good wasn't it that just came to me okay
[1:20:47] and then what does he do
[1:20:49] she do she feeds it a little little time
[1:20:51] and then when they get old enough guess
[1:20:54] what they already got the talons they
[1:20:57] already got the beat they just don't
[1:20:59] know how to use it yet that's it right
[1:21:05] there
[1:21:05] now teach you how to use what you've
[1:21:08] already got right but an eagle likes
[1:21:13] meat Eagle won't think even knows what
[1:21:15] milk is hey man strong meats good for
[1:21:21] you people so then you got black horse
[1:21:24] coming up in this age you've got a black
[1:21:27] horse now as we said before watch I'm
[1:21:32] gonna read you a quote here in just a
[1:21:33] minute that I looked up this morning but
[1:21:37] you got white red black and then pale
[1:21:39] right now if if the mystery underneath
[1:21:44] the seal we know what the seal was the
[1:21:46] seal was the white house rider
[1:21:48] the Antichrist and it's the same guy
[1:21:51] gets on the next horse not a different
[1:21:54] guy same guy gets on another power
[1:21:56] brother Brown city changes his ministry
[1:21:58] he can't be white righteous in the
[1:22:00] Morgan and wife because he's got
[1:22:02] god-fearing people on the earth that
[1:22:03] said hey watch out for them people
[1:22:05] policy grievious wolves have come among
[1:22:08] you and are among you now separate
[1:22:12] yourself from that right so Satan says I
[1:22:15] think it was kill him instead of riding
[1:22:19] with him and going to church with him I
[1:22:20] think I'll just kill him that's what he
[1:22:22] did
[1:22:22] he changed this doctrine right here and
[1:22:25] began killing Christians for a thousand
[1:22:28] years he killed sixty-eight million
[1:22:30] literally killed 68 million under
[1:22:34] Christianity
[1:22:36] hey brother Brown said untold billions
[1:22:38] by their doctor that's why we're coming
[1:22:40] we're heading into this black because
[1:22:43] black is death because remember we don't
[1:22:47] know what to call it until the next seal
[1:22:48] but at black is death and then but it
[1:22:53] wasn't so much killing this time the
[1:22:55] natural person how can you kill a man
[1:23:01] brother Ram said you kill him when you
[1:23:04] kill his influence you don't have to
[1:23:07] fitzy than that ain't the flesh it's not
[1:23:09] the flesh physically killing somebody
[1:23:11] that's called a murderer but how many
[1:23:13] murders we have even in this message
[1:23:15] that kill people's influence hello kill
[1:23:19] people's influence you've killed the
[1:23:22] person the prophet said so here we go
[1:23:25] Satan is getting more and more and more
[1:23:27] deceptive but thank God God knew that
[1:23:34] and everything he does is a contrast
[1:23:38] everything Satan does it's what God's
[1:23:40] already done so what we're going to look
[1:23:45] on here third seal extremely important
[1:23:47] it was so important it was protected by
[1:23:49] the lamb the lamb said hurt not the only
[1:23:52] one stopped Satan you're not doing this
[1:23:54] anymore I will restore not reformed I
[1:24:01] restore that which you have tore down in
[1:24:05] these Middle Ages you tore it down I'm
[1:24:08] going to start restoring and I'm gonna
[1:24:10] restore it back to the original because
[1:24:14] remember we must brother branham the
[1:24:17] message your melancholy force to do two
[1:24:18] things
[1:24:19] what restored the faith of the fathers
[1:24:23] back to the church again and to what
[1:24:30] reveal the thunders which is a
[1:24:32] revelation contained in the seventh to
[1:24:34] end the seventh seal not on an Amen
[1:24:37] because you can have the anointing of
[1:24:39] the Holy Ghost every day in your life
[1:24:40] dying go to hell
[1:24:41] but you can never have the Holy Ghost in
[1:24:43] your soul and dying go to hell ever
[1:24:46] you're sealed you're finished you're
[1:24:48] done but now we must what build on what
[1:24:52] we've already got so we've got a voice
[1:24:54] we've got wheat barley all in wine all
[1:24:58] that is what nourishment nourishment
[1:25:02] wheat and barley makes bread and all the
[1:25:04] different things brother Brown says the
[1:25:06] staff alive we're gonna go through this
[1:25:07] real quick read a quote and we'll be
[1:25:08] finished oil that's what the Holy Ghost
[1:25:12] and the wine is the stimulation once you
[1:25:16] get to holy go okay so now let's put it
[1:25:19] together so we've got the the white
[1:25:23] horse rider type in justification right
[1:25:27] the red horse rider red is always
[1:25:29] sanctification amen
[1:25:31] so the red horse rider typing
[1:25:33] sanctification what cleansed and set
[1:25:35] aside for service now you say well
[1:25:38] brother how is the black going to be
[1:25:41] deal with the Holy Ghost it's not all
[1:25:50] that liveth so I must be dead it's not
[1:25:57] eyes it liveth but Christ that liveth in
[1:26:01] me how many of us are gonna believe that
[1:26:03] we got to start believing that we are
[1:26:06] dead
[1:26:07] our old past life is not divorced
[1:26:13] that's why there's no thing called
[1:26:15] divorcement in Christianity it's not a
[1:26:18] type but if your husband dies dead back
[1:26:26] dead you can marry again so if the old
[1:26:30] you is dead you can marry the Christ but
[1:26:34] the problem is is we just like to do
[1:26:36] like brother Brown said we'd like to put
[1:26:38] him over in the closet and shut the door
[1:26:40] the old man that's not a death that's
[1:26:44] not a dying out so much to where God
[1:26:47] said hurting off the oil and wine I'm
[1:26:49] gonna give these people power to
[1:26:53] overcome power to live power to have a
[1:26:57] life I will restore now let's read this
[1:27:02] last quotes and then we'll finished
[1:27:04] right here okay only an hour and 10
[1:27:06] minutes maybe you don't get it Wow
[1:27:11] brother branham what do you mean maybe
[1:27:12] we don't get it that's what he said I'm
[1:27:15] just reading quote maybe you don't get
[1:27:17] it let me go over it again I want you to
[1:27:19] get this thing you know what listen to
[1:27:20] this this is our promise
[1:27:22] because remember you and I are spiritual
[1:27:24] Eve right bear to leave look I want you
[1:27:30] to get this she was promised the bride
[1:27:32] Eve read that to me - what it didn't say
[1:27:46] have a redeemer it said be a redeemer
[1:27:51] see that's our problem people would
[1:27:53] think well you know it's God God out
[1:27:54] there no sin hearing God out there no we
[1:28:01] just we just ain't getting it yet but
[1:28:03] we're gonna get it we're getting it we
[1:28:05] relieved we're getting it okay her
[1:28:07] Redeemer would be the word so if the
[1:28:10] bride Eve's gonna be a redeemer she's
[1:28:12] got to be the word and when the word
[1:28:16] came made flesh she rejected it now he's
[1:28:21] talking about Israel at this moment but
[1:28:25] why Marie
[1:28:26] quote she was given substitution now
[1:28:29] hold that substitute given substitutes
[1:28:33] to go on now look this is the third seal
[1:28:35] we're talking about the new birds we're
[1:28:37] talking about Redemption and now brother
[1:28:39] Brown was talking about redemption in
[1:28:40] the third seal all right she was giving
[1:28:42] substitutes giving substance used to go
[1:28:44] on until the redeemer come in other
[1:28:47] words what bulls and goats substitute
[1:28:51] and when the Redeemer comes she wanted
[1:28:55] to continue with her substitute and
[1:28:57] rejected the true word brother branham
[1:29:00] was the prophet and I just believe that
[1:29:05] he's going to come back and we're gonna
[1:29:07] get this rapture in faith and please
[1:29:11] people please don't believe that that is
[1:29:13] a lie of the devil
[1:29:14] that is a lie the devil because Eve the
[1:29:18] bride Eve to be a redeemer redemption
[1:29:23] lies in this room right now
[1:29:26] [Applause]
[1:29:29] that ain't a skim milk and when the
[1:29:33] Redeemer come to she wanted to continue
[1:29:35] with her substitute and rejected the
[1:29:38] true word and that was the Hebrew bride
[1:29:40] so did he by the second debride the
[1:29:43] mother of all spiritual living see Eve
[1:29:46] means the mother of all that spirit all
[1:29:48] that's living either as the mother of
[1:29:50] all living we know that now when he come
[1:29:52] to the Hebrew bride she was a mother of
[1:29:55] all that was living but she rejected it
[1:30:00] naturally fell in Eden by listening to
[1:30:04] Satan's reasoning against God's Word and
[1:30:07] it was what brother Bob only one word
[1:30:09] that's how she fell all right sir she
[1:30:13] fell because she did that spiritually
[1:30:15] now that's the church Christ bride she
[1:30:19] fell not in Eden but in Rome would look
[1:30:22] at me he fell she fell in Rome the nice
[1:30:25] thing council 606 take it right back to
[1:30:28] here that's a nice end counsel when she
[1:30:30] rejected that Pentecostal church that
[1:30:33] went down - Nasia and listen to Rome's
[1:30:37] reason instead
[1:30:38] holding onto the word she fell and
[1:30:42] everything away from her died with her
[1:30:46] look god this black horse it's so
[1:30:50] horrible but it's a doctrine and it's
[1:30:54] the folks dead doctrines in this message
[1:30:56] is what's keeping us here
[1:31:00] can't get an amen
[1:31:03] now just as naturally I'm telling you
[1:31:06] God's got to reach in the womb of our
[1:31:08] mind and turn that baby cuz we're gonna
[1:31:13] have to have the correct birth the heads
[1:31:16] got to come first and the heads Christ
[1:31:18] amen so whatever our thinking has been
[1:31:21] it's gonna have to be turned or when I
[1:31:24] die hallelujah by and by Oh we'll just
[1:31:26] keep singing that song now just as
[1:31:28] naturally felt spiritually fell God's
[1:31:31] bride fail fail in the garden
[1:31:33] Christ's bride fell in room by the same
[1:31:36] reasoning against God's Word
[1:31:38] she also forfeited her rights of virtue
[1:31:42] to Satan which we found in the breaking
[1:31:47] of these seals that that was Satan and
[1:31:51] still is Satan there and the Bible said
[1:31:53] it's the very seat of Satan and as he
[1:31:56] forfeited her virtuous rights and give
[1:31:59] them over to Satan in the Garden of Eden
[1:32:00] the church the Bride of Christ did the
[1:32:03] same thing at Rome when he forfeited
[1:32:05] they forfeited the Bible for their
[1:32:08] dogmas and reasoning that's why coming
[1:32:11] out of this into this age that red
[1:32:13] killing was natural but it began a
[1:32:16] spiritual killing it began a spiritual
[1:32:21] killing and it turned into the blackness
[1:32:23] the blackness of Cain what was Cain's
[1:32:26] problem he went out from the presence of
[1:32:28] God
[1:32:28] he went into outer darkness where
[1:32:31] there's weeping wailing and gnashing of
[1:32:33] teeth art go to the next quote this is
[1:32:36] the last one that God has promised this
[1:32:38] is the same third seal actually it's the
[1:32:40] same thought now God has promised her
[1:32:43] because look what I read you there's no
[1:32:45] hope back he didn't give us a way back
[1:32:49] now he's gonna give us a way back all
[1:32:52] right now God
[1:32:53] promised her as he did he told Eve there
[1:32:55] would come a time that the word would
[1:32:57] come back to her again
[1:32:59] now you remember that what she lost from
[1:33:03] it would be restored because there's
[1:33:06] only one thing can restore and that's
[1:33:09] the word as I said shoot a gun if you
[1:33:12] don't hit the target find where it went
[1:33:14] off at you got to come back there and
[1:33:16] start again see if you go back you go -
[1:33:19] Nasia that's where you start again see
[1:33:22] go back away from them organisations in
[1:33:25] this message away from all that church
[1:33:30] we've been seeing these seals is
[1:33:32] perfectly I always wondered all my life
[1:33:35] why I was so against the organizational
[1:33:36] system not two people know the people
[1:33:39] are just like me or you or anybody else
[1:33:41] but that system that denominational
[1:33:44] system now I see it right now I never
[1:33:46] knowed it till now that's right when he
[1:33:49] come to that third seal see look look
[1:33:51] look for a minute there was no
[1:33:53] denominations from here back none zero
[1:33:57] there was no denominational now there
[1:34:00] was denominational ideas spirits and
[1:34:04] then there was denominational spirits
[1:34:05] but there was no Badgers Methodist
[1:34:07] Pentecostal Wesley Luther where did they
[1:34:11] all come from them - ages right there
[1:34:14] it's where all denominations come from
[1:34:17] Rome started it but then they developed
[1:34:20] the what the Reformation are the
[1:34:25] Protestant movement was started right in
[1:34:29] here right because John Wesley's
[1:34:32] wondered I mean Martin Luther's wasn't
[1:34:33] started right
[1:34:36] protesting products my products that
[1:34:38] means protesting the Catholic Church
[1:34:40] well instead of protesting it and taking
[1:34:42] them on to God they protested and went
[1:34:45] right back in the denomination again and
[1:34:48] created a blackness that's so horrible
[1:34:52] I'll read it read the scripture next
[1:34:54] Sunday let's stand their feet the Bible
[1:34:57] says there's a woman that's dead while
[1:35:02] she's alive
[1:35:04] she's dead by what she takes that's not
[1:35:11] the Word of God my question to you is
[1:35:14] could that be us I say no I say the word
[1:35:22] is protected by the Lamb just like it
[1:35:24] was in that third seal and if I'm part
[1:35:27] of the word brother I'm just said Eve
[1:35:28] would be what the word the word would be
[1:35:31] what restored her back that restoration
[1:35:33] of the word brother Ram said comes
[1:35:35] restoration of power what power back
[1:35:38] into the people not the denomination
[1:35:41] sure they're going to get there they
[1:35:48] asked the will that went over there
[1:35:49] that's the guy and where was the Welsh

[1:47:25] guard stop one day and he said don't you
[1:47:26] ever forget Calvary don't you ever
[1:47:29] forget what that man God Almighty and

[1:47:40] you believe that that's good but he died
[1:47:43] for me he took stripes to heal my body

[1:47:49] he didn't have a stripe on his body sure
[1:47:52] he had no scars in his hand to prove
[1:47:53] where he was that but no no that body
[1:47:56] wasn't corrupt that body was ready to go
[1:48:00] up and that's what's gonna happen to us
[1:48:02] let's bow our heads there Heavenly
[1:48:04] Father we could stay here all day but
[1:48:07] we're human beings and we have human
[1:48:08] things to do father and I'm sure be glad
[1:48:11] one day when we don't have to do that
[1:48:13] when we can just sit down for a thousand
[1:48:16] years with each person and just remember
[1:48:19] one day said all you remember when
[1:48:20] brother Nathanael came to see us there
[1:48:22] in May of 2018 and he brought a little
[1:48:27] message that maybe thought was so
[1:48:28] insignificant but just lit a fire in our
[1:48:32] heart and brought a sweet spirit to this
[1:48:34] church oh yeah I remember that let's
[1:48:37] talk about it what a day that will be
[1:48:39] we pray that you just be with each one
[1:48:42] on the way home Lord on the highways
[1:48:44] Satan would truly love to get rid of all
[1:48:47] of us but you have a protecting hand you
[1:48:49] have there's a promise that somebody's
[1:48:52] going to make it and we're are those
[1:48:55] that are alive and remain at the moment
[1:48:57] and we pray Lord that you would just
[1:49:00] sanctify our hearts we're fixing to go
[1:49:04] back out in the world and go to work and
[1:49:05] do the things that we have to do Lord
[1:49:08] knowing that the wheels are turning on
[1:49:10] the inside there's an eternity walking
[1:49:12] on this earth that the world has no clue
