don't you good to see everybody in the house of the lord if you'd like to read it along with us follow the scripture turn to where we've been reading ephesians 1 8 and 10 and then we'll go to matthew 13 37-39 so just remember that then we want to read from all together we will do from matthew 6 the lord's prayer when we finish the reading of the scriptures and things we want to do the lord's prayer okay you know just remember the sick ones remember the different things remember the uh bible study this coming saturday keep that in mind and keep in mind the eating together on the 11th and just all of the things and just have all of these things in your mind and your thoughts amen that the lord would bless each one father we thank you for a day and a time that we can really sing a song and think about the words of a song that truly you would open the eyes of our heart lord that we may see you because that's our desire and we know that we can't see you with physical eyes and things because that's can be faked by satan but yet we know for a certainty that you can open the eyes of our heart and we can see you have you away with us forgive our sins and guide us by thy grace and love and just keep us as we walk in you remember the sequence remember abby lord and that whole problem and just take away that vomiting and things that are bothering her today and let everything be all right we love you and we thank you god each one of us forgive our sins and keep us in your love in jesus name amen ephesians 1 verse 8 wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ but which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him all right gathering all there into him okay matthew 13 36 he answered and said unto them he that soweth the good seed is the son of man the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tires are the children of the wicked one now that's self-explanatory or should be see the enemy that sowed them is the devil the harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the angels okay amen so let's just go now and read from because we'll go from matthew six i just thought it's cause you'll see when we get into the to the message part you'll see what i'm talking about okay ready let's all quote it together then after this manner therefore pray ye our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom the power and glory forever amen you may be seated lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now trying to continue i thought because i hope you understand it's not a lot of preachers they don't do that but i can't when company comes in very much i can't just continue a thought i have to back up and relate into that thought enough to maybe try to help somebody because you want to be a help you don't want to be a hindrance and then they come in and hear you and they wonder a lot what we say anyway so i pray that it was a brother and sister in christ and maybe they'll be back with us so you know but thinking about the things that we've been talking about this dispensation of the son of man all right then we know that when we finish this we will go into the dispensation of the son of god all right but the key to understanding the whole bible is we talk about god having three names son of god son of man son of david well you know uh that's true but there's more manifestations and i hope you've caught that part of us injecting it like that he's called the son of abraham all right and then realizing then that we've got to come back to a position of in our thoughts back to the son of man in the last days before there will be a rapture of the church all right then in doing it i know that it took me i don't know how many times seemed like it was four times that uh listening to the message the unveiling of god it was just a point that we used to each one of us would like bring a tape and we had one of those battery-powered recorders and we'd listen to tapes going to work in back you didn't have the cook up you know like into the cigarette lighters if you did you didn't even have a cigarette lighter in the old cars you know things like that but i remember it about the fourth time that we listened to the unveiling of god in a row then i knew that there had to be something connected and then i could see then from what he was bringing and i'll get to that later on that see you've got son of man son of god son of david all right see but now really what you've got you've got son of man son of god son of man son of david all right so you've got that to be you got to deal with it in that form or you'll never understand because now like what i'm trying to say to you you could not come to the son of god the baptism of the holy ghost the new birth the things like that until we first come what son of man all right then we can get the son of man out of the way then you can see because of the son of man a way was made that the son of god could come into the hearts of the people because he would give up his life and it would come back all right so it would make a way all right so now you just have to take this as my own thoughts because it's way i've always preached it and believe it so you come into the church ages we'll cover that the seven church ages that you've got at dealing with son of god all right but then how could you go to the millennial reign as son of david are you listening the only way you can come to the son of god the new birth now listen the only way you can you can come the son of god the new birth is for the fact that the son of man had to come and relink or give up that life that was within him to come back on you to make it in the son of god right all right well now how can you go from son of god the son of david and you'll see this message is so perfect until it just baffles my human i'm not that smart but it baffles my human intelligence to hear of a seventh grade educated man and he'd do like that he said okay in in the unveiling of god he'd say son of god son of man son of god he said then just for a little while he comes back as son of man and then you go to son of david and i said oh amen but remember son of man is earthly doings that's what we're trying to talk about this morning see man was what lost the world was you know we're going to cover it the the world and things is what was lost and man lost the world all right see now to return that back we've got to come back then in the last days the son of man to an earthly revelation part things manifestation dispensations whatever you want to call it before he could go to the israel as the son of david because now remember what he's going to do when he goes to israel look at the perfection and i'm just putting these in to let you think and we'll come back and hit some of it see when he goes to israel he'll go through two prophets right son of man now he can't be son of david to them just immediately he gives that 144 000 eternal life right there's the son of god so when he goes to israel it will be son of man through the two prophets they'll preach the message the holy ghost will fall giving them eternal life and then they'll realize he's the son of david we'll see how the perfect part but we can't just do that in the church ages we've got to go son of man son of god son of man for a little while now keep that in your mind and just let that ponder in your hearts and your desires and you'll think about some things that you'll see then what we're trying to do all right now not to back up too much but to back up to excuse me where we were talking about this morning that on the future home the prophet said this is my part of the earth he's saying that's what god is saying come down a voice a dove and a voice saying this is my part of the earth that i have redeemed it's saying what it says there in the scripture this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell but he said literally it's saying you understand what the prophet is doing he's breaking that down to literal understanding to the point that he's saying the voice was saying it this is my part of the earth that i have redeemed and from this part of the earth i will redeem the rest of it so his body had to be redeemed not because it was sinful but because it had a beginning the body was not eternal it had a beginning all right see then by doing that we come on over where brother branham was talking about jesus was part of the earth that the holy ghost descended upon see the human element that was a human element he could have given you a blood transfusion but just remember he's not just he's not just body soul and spirit jesus christ and then god comes down that soul and spirit was the whole soul and spirit of almighty god or else he was just a man now what are you going to deal with him if he was just a man this man was the lord jesus christ god made flesh verse 14 said and the word was made flesh all right see then seeing that we've got it in the correct order by way of the prophet that he comes down to that earth and man fell in the earth sure we fell in the soul in the garden but we lost more than that remember this morning we lost more we'll get back to it in a minute we lost these bodies that's what we lost in the garden because even though you could come back and you could if you could give eternal life somewhat to mankind adam's body was not eternal no way that you you can bring the full plan of redemption all right see then what did we lose as the prophet said it on proven his word he said where we go through water baptism in the holy ghost baptism then the holy ghost comes down at the fire baptism and claims his creation earth this listen the same as it did him the holy ghost and god is the self-same spirit see it cannot come see it comes down and claims this body for the resurrection you see when that holy spirit came down on jesus on the river jordan it claimed him his body when you receive the new birth amen right when you receive the new birth claims is made upon your body that's why we don't get a new body we get this body redeemed all right see now that ought to be dawning on us a that is of what god has done that when he gave you the new birth he not just gave you eternal life in your soul he laid claims on that body that you're living in then why shouldn't we think about it being quickened one day to be made eternal all right now when we got down the end of the park this morning hitting it just a little but brother branham was talking about in that future home on that river jordan he said think of it the holy ghost descending upon earth jesus and that holy blood now watch he said i hope it don't go too far that holy blood was created with god the blood the life the creation of god jesus was the beginning of the creation of god that's revelation 3 14 right the message to this age jesus was the beginning of the creation of god evidently then now listen evidently god was not satisfied i don't know anywhere else to say but he evidently wasn't satisfied with the way things was in the garden even if it just stayed that away you know if it just stayed right if it just stayed right you would had adam and we'll cover in a minute from blasphemius night adam and eve with eternal life but your prophet says blasphemous names but their body was not eternal so there still had to bend something and now watch that was the natural physical beginning of mankind right come on the natural beginning of mankind was in the garden well was that not called the beginning of the creation of god it was the beginning of the creation of god as mankind wasn't it but it was not what he wanted right he had other attributes remember so they would have to come forth man would have to be lost and need a savior then and only then could he come forth after 4 000 years of building a body by the word of god through those prophets would he be able to come forth with one standing on the earth that would be emmanuel god with us that in him would be the fullness of the godhead bodily and that he would be the beginning of the creation of god what god really wanted in the garden was made possible it's jesus christ and there he was soul and spirit okay eternal but not a body so then the beginning of the creation of god has to do with our body amen remember it had to do with his body but random is what'd he say how did this beginning of the creation of god begin in the wounds of a woman a flesh man now he's talking about something of being flesh man to deal with son of man and it would be the beginning of the creation of god that was the creation he wanted and he knew what he'd have to do so he couldn't come down and just make an eternal body right because he's got to have the savior the healer the redeemer then his body could be made eternal in the resurrection and ascension i put both of those together because of him raising and going up all right see then he's the beginning of the creation of god and the prophet of god said what about us we are the continuation of that creation what creation what was the what was the beginning of the creation of god god in human flesh living upon the earth in a body that he had spoken to existence and was not eternal lived just like you and i in that human body remember that human body wasn't sex born now that's the difference right okay it was a creation because he created the egg in the sperm but a special group of people there would be god in human flesh well no no that's just a little bit too strong why why is it a little too strong because what you've been taught what you've been taught is hindering you me too i'm not saying just you ain't me i'm saying us what's been taught us in our life but until we heard of this prophet we all believed we were going to get a new body we sung songs about it didn't we but then he began to talk about something that we had not considered he began to talk about a body to be made eternal but remember his body was made eternal right now when he stood on earth he was departed he was the physical creation but it was not complete but when he went up and came back to earth he stood here completely the full beginning of the creation of god that he wanted i know brother gary atkis and i used to talk like you ever notice that it's after the resurrection when jesus said all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth you'll notice the scripture we think well it was giving him sure it was but remember he said it when he stood here after the resurrection he said all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth and we're not have to worry about too much should we all right now to get our thought picking back up where we left off so it was on the gabriel's instructions again daniel they don't have to pull them up i'll just paraphrase it a little bit he's talking about how that he had to come and he had to die and all to do and get a title deed break the seals reveal what was in them and give inheritance that belonged to him to the people give the inheritance that belonged to him first off the full word is to give that to the people second part is what eternal life that he inherited by doing that what about that man that we call jesus christ was not eternal but by doing what he done and releasing the life out of him he inherited eternal life in that flesh come on he passed his own life back to his people eternal life that he inherited by doing that what passing his own life back to the people at calvary then he inherited eternal life you remember we went on to this one revelation chapter 5 1961. he said he breaks the seals gives us his inheritance to his people he gives the inheritance that he inherited becoming kinsmen redeemer and freely gives it to us it all belonged to him but he brings it back to us by doing what he done that flesh then inherited eternal life well i understand what you just you make it so confusing and we don't believe this and we believe he wouldn't we we don't believe he's eternal now we believe this is eternal take the stages and follow it while he was on earth his body was not eternal but in the resurrection and ascension his body was made eternal his body is now eternal right all right that's why brother brown says it on the adoption this is where we ended up he said jesus never gave you an inheritance you know you say yes he did he said no he didn't he said he come to he brought you to your inheritance he only come down came down and paid for your inheritance brought you to your inheritance but your name was put on the lounge book of life god gives you your inheritance your inheritance was first your inheritance was where your name was written in about lynn's book of life before the foundation of the world there's your inheritance the other thing that we really need right and to understand it that way to follow what he has done that he released his life the ransom was paid remember we went through that back in the scripture i found the ransom found somebody that could pay the price you remember job somebody that could stand between god and man and bring it together we found the ransom which was the lord jesus christ the soul never died the spirit never died right it left the body it was the body that died even you in your natural even if you're lost and you die your soul and your spirit don't die it goes to some position to wait your body is what dies so you ought to be able to see then what took place at calvary his body died the life went out of it that's why it was dead he didn't made a sacrifice all right because what he was the beginning of the creation of god and by the new birth in our soul we become a part of that creation right eternal life in our soul a part of the creation of god waiting for the plan to be finished for us to come forth to be the rest of the creation all right now we're back right where we started the other day because i don't want to lose this in your mind okay so go ahead pull up number eight now where we've been talking about and you'll see why we use the scripture or done the lord's prayer i use the lord's prayer for the purpose of doing exactly what i want to do now taken from christ is a mystery god revealed paragraph 143 but what he wanted to do he loved fatherhood for he was a father and the only way that he could express it was to become a son of man now god was father in that he created adam right he created mankind every time a baby is born he's still creating right a soul for that baby a spirit the body comes from mama and daddy do you still creating that one but that's the old creation that could not be called as paul said the new creation but look at what he's saying what he wanted to do he loved fatherhood or he was a father and the only way that he could express it or bring it out was to become a son of man that's the reason jesus kept saying the son of man they didn't know what he was talking about many of them but now you get it congregation said amen he wanted to express himself that was his one of his great threefold purposes was to express himself identify himself with human beings to reveal himself in christ now what's what i'm talking about adam was the beginning of the human race but that was not the way god wanted it even if he left him in the garden without sin it would not have been the attributes of god fulfilled by coming the way he did he's fulfilling all the attributes then if he's the beginning of the creation of god and we are the continuation of that creation how did we get here i mean we were just here and he just come down no how did we get here what did it then that we would think about him being son of man but remember the scripture we used the son of man is the sower of the seed the son of man sowed the children of the kingdom you want to read that scripture again in matthew the children of the kingdom the devil sowed the tires that's not the children of the king that's to kill children of the wicked one we were all a part of that by our natural creation all right now think about it and truly is our father and when they ask jesus how to pray what did he say pray this away our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name when mary had the resurrection and the lord jesus standing there he said don't touch me i've not yet ascended but where did he say he is gone i'm going to my father and your father right i'm going to my god and your god because he was not fully gone on into the full translation or what you want to call it the ascension but he said i go to my father and your father no wonder he could say they say teach us how to pray he said pray our father which art in heaven you ever noticed paul never had no trouble when he'd say something he'd say the god and father of our lord jesus christ bless you all god father lord jesus christ oh we've got about six gods running around it's not if the father is the same right so who is our father now if he sowed the children of the kingdom he sowed the word right but then truly the new birth is what the birth of the word that you took in hell and the holy spirit comes upon it and gives you the new birth no wonder we're the children of god no wonder paul in acts 1 19 we are his offspring he said you said it and it's right we're his offspring now what about it now fleshly speaking the body jesus had a beginning right it had to be made eternal all right fleshly speaking we received the new birth you know what i'm talking about as we do in our natural we only receive eternal life in the soul not even in the spirit because it doesn't you got to deal with that sucker and that's our problem in that spirit now you never heard brother branham i said this over and over back in the prior messages brother branham said there was a seed sowed for every age and he said there was a people to make that word alive in that age come on read your bible then the son of man is the sower of the seed and what did he sow he sowed the children of the kingdom the word then when you receive the eternal life you know when you receive the the new birth it makes that word alive in you right that's eternal life then why would we worry and get so confusing into our mind that brother brandon would make some statements we've had these for about three weeks now i'm gonna finally get to read them today go ahead to number nine brother which is taken from the message expectation 1956. do you realize that that the very earth that you're sitting over tonight is nothing more than the word of god did you know god made the world out of his spoken word that enough roll it up he made the earth sitting over everything he made the chair that you're sitting in he's his spoken word brought the material into the earth right are you following with me he spoke it into existence now watch he spoke you into existence he spoke me into existence he said when you think of that he said there were doubters poke you into existence you're not talking about a human element like adam that part sinned he's talking about a new creation a new race of people and he was the beginning of that race of people and we as born again believers are the rest of that family all right go on to the next one law having a shadow pull on up i'm just getting the word to you as long as god accepted christ he accepted you with christ and when did he do it before the foundation of the world that right when he spoke it into existence he spoke you redeemed with him when he was redeemed you was redeemed because your name was put on the lounge book of life for the foundation of the world why don't we believe it why would it be such a problem to think about as coming away to the next one which is a message called the junction of time he's talking about according to another verse and all heavenly father we're not much to begin with lord we just come here because you spoke us into existence you just come because you spoke us into existence you fed us keep us he's focused into existence what about it number 12 the identified masterpiece coming down to the lounge book of life for the foundation world now that god had us in his thinking then we have eternal life because then he spoke us we were his children before the foundation of the world and we're certainly not talking about what you're looking at i'm not talking about what i'm looking at right it's the word the children of god are the word because our father now watch his father and our father is the same in flesh brother brown said jesus had a father and a mother huh now you'll see why that i've said that so much to you and just leaving it alone we know his father wasn't joseph we got no sense no better than we know his mother wasn't mary his father was almighty god hebrews 10 5 a body thou hast prepared me i'll give you the quote where brother brown said a body said the father provided who was his father almighty god who is his mother the word not a woman the word who is your father if you have the new birth are you going to make jesus lying when he said i go to my father and your father to my god and your god see when he gave you the new birth there's your father your mother is the word that we're following on to meet him with the word we have eternal life because then he spoke us and we come in to existence he spoke us and we came into existence that's why i asked a question and i know i get offend people i asked a question here at the church about 20 years ago one day and at that time a lot maybe a little more than 20. a lot was being preached about son of man about the country and i asked a simple question i said you say you understand son of man i said do you even understand son of god it offends some of you it's it's especially some of the others for what i said i said when is the first time in the bible that the son of god came into being not one person stood up and said anything so i went ahead and said it i said because every one of you are thinking son of god was two thousand years ago on the shores of galilee i said no but around said the son of god was the logos that came out of god in the beginning before the foundation of the world the son of god is what created the world see we think oh yeah we understand i said there's no need to talk about son of man until we get son of god out of the way and for 20 something years we've been on that all right listen let's go back to that beginning now just for a minute and we won't take too long because i'll drop off and preach some more later on what did man fall from in the garden we'll read it but rome said he fell from eternal life now i ask you a simple question how can you fall from eternal life i don't care what dispensation the great brother in this message he said well that was back there in the old testament and maybe it could be there i said no way you can't fall from eternal life god is not an indian giver he doesn't give you something and take it away he can take you off the scene like he did the man in the hebrew book because he wouldn't line up with god and got off the word he took him off the scene he said he wouldn't let his child mar his name what happened to adam and eve in the garden what happened in that original fall did they just fall in soul or did they fall in body spirit and soul which one was it see then you'll see why he's our father the son of man is our father the only way the son of man could be father the way it could be father was to be the son of man which would speak the word into existence remember he spoke before the world but remember that's got to come down here and be spoke down here someway so then before the foundation of the world god in his mind saw what would take place are we right then one day jesus stood on the earth and spoke this new creation of people into existence the son of man is the sower the seed he said the good seed are the children of the kingdom he had to speak them into existence well he didn't speak me but he spoke eternal life into existence he spoke the word they would come down and be all the way see then the key is to understand what happened in the garden but we know all about it it was a sex act we we got it all figured out now we got the beast and all these things we know all about it can you fall from eternal life can god take eternal life away from anyone now if you got that settled then we can move on if you ain't we might as well go home if you ain't got that settled there's no need to continue the rest of the service if you ain't got it settled that god can't give you eternal life and take it back i'm not going to do anything he wants to this is what i mean see you might we'll go home but if you can see that god cannot take it back so there must be something that we've got to see in the way that it's worded and the things of what happened in the garden i've been on this 40 years so don't be concerned these very quotes quoting it for 40 years go ahead to number 13. this is taken from the breach paragraph 90. and when a person is struck with diseases aches and pains one time there wasn't that way but they were groaning why they're not right there's something wrong they're groaning and trying to get back to where they was when they had health and when nature had people and when nature and people as the bible said are groaning it shows there's something that they're not in their ought to be conditioned they are fallen from somewhere amen where'd we fall from okay go ahead that's paragraph 90. this is paragraph 91. now we don't need anybody to interpret that for us see of course we know it was eternal life they had fallen from brother dale you are correcting brother branham that's why i said we might as well go home you're correcting brother branham because you just said brother brown said or you just said it there's no way that you could lose eternal life brother others said they fell for eternal life you want to go home or you want to continue i get a few continues but a lot of you just looking like we need to go home okay now watch we know it was eternal life they had fallen from and they lost their claims on eternal life by the fall of adam and eve who fell from eternal life to death in the garden of eden and brought all nature unto them to death now does that make it then that god can give you eternal life and then take it away or what happened in the garden he said a tree never died before adam an animal wouldn't die before adam there's only one thing that cannot die and that's god because he's eternal yeah sold out our birthright and crossed the chasm now we're beyond the reach of god on this other side adam fell to death he brought death upon all creation now he was given free moral agency and it was given to him you know to make a choice see so now what do you think i'm going to say what the prophet said he said we fell from eternal life okay that's your choice but then you got god taken away so you got the possibility are you listening then that puts you in the category with the possibility if that's the way you're thinking that you can get eternal life today and lose it tomorrow that's the possibility you've just laid out if that's what you believe what are you correcting right around he don't need to be corrected he does his own correcting he said it the way he wanted to say it where it would hide it from the wise and prudent but would reveal it to the babes they're in christ okay we'd reveal it to the babes in christ adam fell to death in the garden while we're reading it let's just see some things that he lost then we'll get back to our point go ahead to number 14. he talked about adam's sin by eating his wife's you know then produced the product to adam and had him turning loose the word sold out he lost also his inheritance when he lost his fellowship and right to life remember the day you eat the other day you die and when he lost his life he also lost his inheritance in life because he had completely supreme control of the earth he was a god of the earth god's the god of the universe everybody's son had this earth under his own control he could speak he could name he could say he could stop nature he could do anything he wanted to but when he did that he lost his inheritance coming on down to what he is who was he was a minor god under god our father because he was the son of god okay but now look we could stop here for a minute and get a real sermon and then if the blood was cl has cleaned it back what about now look what the son of god the second adam did he said the word works i do so you do also see adam lost his inheritance the earth that was his inheritance he passed his hand to the one he sold out to what did if adam lost eternal life did he sell out and go to hell oh you're asking some questions that i'm not capable of answering thank you 40 years of studying it he sold out to satan he sold his faith in god to satan's reason therefore his eternal life is right to the tree of life his right to the earth belonged to him and he forfeited every bit to the hands of satan he passed it from his hand to satan the seed of abraham has destroyed the inheritance that adam should have had that's the earth why would there be so much connection to the earth why is there so much in relation to the earth why is it the important dispensation is the son of man the son of man's god of the earth right remember the quotes we gave so the man's god of the earth here he was that okay is it possible to get eternal life and lose it that's what i said if you say that you can have eternal life and lose it then you put yourself in the possibility that you'll never know who you really are and what you're doing because you'll never have the right you'll be listen you'll be just like the denominations you would never come through the baptist so you wouldn't know it but in the baptist they preached you one sermon one sunday the glory hallelujah you're sealed in everything's done you got eternal life then the next sunday they'd preach on that one no none good no not one and they'd send you to hell even though you claimed eternal life for 40 years now we say oh no am is any methodist in here i don't see any hands but you know what the methodists believe methodists believe that if you're living right when you die you're going to heaven if you're living wrong you've lost your sanctification that's identically the methodist doctrine that if you're living right when you die you're going is that what you think well i want to be living right that last day i want to live right every day don't you what about it but brother dale brother branham said adam fell from eternal life to death okay let's go to a little message go under number 15. call blasphemous names they say wrote it on up you can get all of it read all of it or not give it to you or you know the whole thing it ain't me just giving you parts look but what god did he breathed the breath of eternal life amen then he become a living soul erase that what did he say you want to read that with me a soul that can't die right so now something happened in adam right that we need to understand amen and why would brother branham say it he fell from eternal life to death and he says the soul can't die well he was wrong here and he's right over here well okay which one's right which one's wrong see now you've got yourself in the the devil's traps because you'll pity pattern through the whole message that way and you'll never house faith to be anchored see because most people never thought about that adam had eternal life right how many people in the message you ever heard preach much about much about adam with eternal life i've been around a long time i'm just telling you as far as i can say i've never heard no one preach that adam had eternal life in his soul maybe you have i hope you have i'm just telling you you don't like it well lump it whatever you want to do with it i don't have no arguments my soul is involved in this as well as yours he's talking about adam he breathed the breath of eternal life into adam then he become a living soul soul that can't die now watch we're going to get into honey plum up their elbows breathe the breath of eternal life into his nostrils and he became an eternal soul who's he talking about adam right because god breathed now watch not what nature done and why would your prophet say that we know that every baby that's borne into the world god has to give that baby life right but in the ba in the form of what we're doing without talking about eternal life that's what nature does do you understand we say nature done this nature gave life to mankind which was god himself doing it the animals have life that nature gives them so what's he saying god breathed now what nature done what god did god breathed the breath of life into his nostrils and he become a living soul you say to me adam died brother branham but remember before adam died he had a lamb that redeemed him okay watch it hallelujah those who before knew he's called he got allowed to redeem them he was the type adam fell then the lamb was provided for adam because already in the nostrils of his nostrils had become the breath of eternity eternal god and he become a living soul he was the son of god all right i'm going to pull it back down just a little bit is that right which one are we on 188 supposed to be there you go you're the son of god not his breath as the african word of more you know animal breeds are more your sinners breath ammonia then why would he struggle if it's just what you believe breathe is eternal life no that's not what it is he said it back forth but god especially upon adam breathe the breath of eternal life and he became become an eternal person with god he had a power like god he was an amateur god he was god of the earth he's got a day of it now what did he say someday the sons of god will again be gods so adam had eternal life right god breathed into his nostrils and he became the eternal life go ahead all we want is a little piece of this one go to the next one we want it's the top part so hold the rest of it the church is a mythical body because this is paragraph 2 32 of christ born to the breath of god well you get it congregation the church of god is born to the breath of god god breathed into the nostril spiritual of adam and you become a living soul did you know the pentecostal proof pentecostal church is born to the breath of god what happened then in the garden you've got mass confusion just laid out in front of you one saying you could lose eternal life another saying you can't lose eternal life and all of it's saying that adam had eternal life in his soul to what did adam fall from well he he just fell from eternal life well then he's lost right and before i go too far i want to make a blunt statement to you that you'll probably deny if adam had eternal life in his soul then you tell me eve didn't have eternal life we're going to go a long ways if you tell me that one because remember adam and eve had the same theophany that's what your prophet said oh i'm just going to say the way that i believe it always adam had eternal life in his soul eve had eternal life in her soul yeah but how could they fall i wish you wouldn't ask that one do you ever do wrong do you ever do wrong all right if you ever do wrong it's got to be something else doing it beside the soul we'll go there because that's the truth right so eve in the garden had the body and the spirit to deal with he just had eternal life in her soul she had her body and their spirit to deal with in the garden that was not eternal come on you would only eternal inner soul adam was only eternal in his soul come on adam had a body and a spirit the body and the spirit is what the fall fell in right you're a christian a born-again christian yet you have a wrong thought if you do wrong what is part of you that does the wrong that's to be the spirit working through the body can't be the soul if you're born again his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin amen okay what happened adam standing in the garden with eternal life in his soul his body had a beginning his spirit had a beginning they were not eternal so what did adam lose he lost the right to the tree of life we read it what was the tree of life in the garden for now here's let me quote brother branham because you have to take this he said the tree of life was in the garden to remind adam and eve that their youth was being renewed now that's that's that's a direct statement it was being renewed adam's life was being renewed it wasn't eternal it couldn't be eternal because nothing had happened adam fell from the point of coming to eternal life in his body so he fell from eternal life so your prophet is right he fell from the fact that his body was never made eternal so he fell from eternal life away from it it was dire which was a tree of life but he couldn't do like i've always said what don't you never think about what would have happened had there not been no sin hypothetical but what what would have happened had there been no sin we ain't going to get in those sex acts no stuff like that because that's the wrong thing but you see adam and eve would have brought us here don't get into the wrong thing on that because you can prove one way and you prove the other way just say it like it is adam and eve would have brought us here if it was just speaking the word amen but it wasn't going to happen when i said hypothetical it wasn't going to happen so they would just forget it but the point is what if it would have happened that we could have all come by spoken word from adam and eve we still would have had a body and a spirit that was not eternal because mama and daddy would have been that the tree of life was there for us to go to and partake of but when sin entered the picture what was told them let's put them forth from the tree of life listen to your bible because we don't said they'll take of the tree of life and live forever because you couldn't live eternal that'd be an eternal sinner come on your bible's right don't do that read your bible put them forward from the tree of life let it be taken and live forever it didn't say and live eternally because it'll be impossible you'd have an eternal sinner so what happened to adam and eve they never attained to an eternal body they lost the right in their claims to an eternal body to satan and he took it over he took this world and the products from this world to a positional situation that something's got to happen one day before it can be eternal whether you know it or not i'm preaching about what the change really is you just ought to listen you see what i'm talking about blasphemous names tells you adam and eternal life the breach the seals city fell from eternal life to death now he didn't lose eternal life in his soul you can't do that now if you do then you've destroyed your whole bible and all your prophets try to teach all this time so put it like it is adam never reached eternal life in his body it was there in front of him which was a tree of life but he fell from it to sin satan came on the scene and remember the quote we were given out of daniel 70 weeks what is the son of man got to do with the son of man was ruler of the earth a certain man is ruler of the earth amen it's more than just talk about a prophet he's a savior healer redeemer father son holy ghost he's all in all and jesus is his name come on brothers my father was sam dale in the natural they say out of 13 i'm the only one that looks like him well i guess he saved the best of life that was 13. i'm glad he did i'm glad they never believed in birth control you ought to get my mama to tell you get the kids to tell you what my mother said the reason they had 13. i won't use that in the pulpit you know i'm glad they didn't believe in birth control i wouldn't have got here but they said out and this is honest they tell me that out of all of them i'm the only one that favors my daddy well i hope i'm the only one that favors my heavenly father but i want everybody else to come to be part of that because he's your father and my father he's your god and my god eternal life do you understand i know it's hard people out there are wondering what in the world they're saying but one time you got eternal aspect you lost you turn around and then you come back and you turn around get ready you just flip flop backwards and forth go back and listen adam never achieved the position of eternal life in his body so he fell from it and he died but he never lost the eternal life into his soul and all we're trying to do is come back to that same eternal life not just in soul but in our bodies i've said it but it's this morning or the beginning of this today you need to remember i ask you to read matthew mark luke and john remember in the gospels it speaks of the son of man it's the sign of the resurrection little man was in the heart of the earth three days a tree now about jonah you know but yet we argued how many hours that was and never thought about it here comes a prophet and he said here's this i said that's not speaking of this times and days and speaking of the resurrection the son of man the messiah is the resurrection i thought that was what we were looking for was a resurrection and then we were alive and remain shall be changed and remember your resurrection lays inside of you because inside of you is eternal life jesus said i am the resurrection and the life what about it what do we got let's stand i was going to end it a little quicker we was listening last night to brother around talking about he said here i am said made all these rules and said you ought to preach 35 40 minutes he said i had to because he had an excuse he did he said he was trying to preach the message to get it out and he even announced in that one he said you'll see the difference he said because they're in 63 on church order he said in other words paraphrasing what he said he said i'm gonna have to start preaching more out there he said that i said i wouldn't preach out there see he was running out of time then you'll see him as he from 63 on true he starts out in the world preaching major doctrines rapture wasn't preached at the tabernacle look at all those things that wouldn't preach at the tabernacle he began to lay it down because he's running out of time i don't have that problem because but i have had 40 or 50 years to preach about it eternal life is not a play party to me it's a person it is the person of jesus christ i want this body to be made eternal don't you go ahead [Music] those precious remember you can't lose eternal life for all my sins so your prophet's got to be saying something [Music] but what he said hid it from the eyes of the wise and prudent just blood stains i have a source what about [Music] let's strength if he lives that takes me through see if he's the same remember though he was the beginning of the creation of god we're the rest of that creation we as the bride of jesus christ are the rest of that creation [Music] lord jesus just take away this problem we condemn it under the blood of jesus christ the one we talked about the eternal life lord it's our little sister she believes she believes you lord so you listen to her crying out for the deliverance and let everything be all right in jesus name think about it what if we could believe like those little children they can't explain a lot of things but they believed think about these things you see you you just think well it's just a way of that one you don't think about the places you put in yourself you don't think about where you've turned down the word to just make your statement [Music] i claim the blood [Music] sit down you say brother now you just confused me no he was born confused i'm just exposing it [Music] more we got all these problems in her body and especially in her neck and her back pink's nerve we condemn that under the blood of jesus christ we believe you lord we believe the word of the lord it has been spoken for us we thank you you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so now let it be in jesus name how about it anybody else [Music] just for you and me what about it think about it [Music] just remember now brother joe's had his month sing for the people brother bob had his next his brother aaron he gets the month of december and then brother uh luis he gets the month of january then we'll have a vote about what we see on a sunday afternoon song leader you know and what so just remember that and just remember to be much in prior for these all right father we thank you we love you we just ask you lord to open our eyes to thy word that we may be able to see it and that way we can follow you and be led of you into your love in your grace forgive our sins cleanse us lord from all unrighteousness make us to be what you want us to be take care of the people on the highway give a safe journey to everyone lord we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen brother sent me an email today and said i thank you to hear you for the people leave you pray for them on the highway
