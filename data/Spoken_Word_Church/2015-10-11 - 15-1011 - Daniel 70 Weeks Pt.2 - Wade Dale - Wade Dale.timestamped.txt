[0:00] take her again after she had already
[0:02] been polluted so not good all right now
[0:07] let's go to Daniel yell it let them use
[0:12] we're going to read some of it but let's
[0:14] go to Daniel 9 & Louise slow me down if
[0:20] I forget your back there ok
[0:27] Daniel 9 24 now what we're going to do
[0:29] is today is we're going to go back and
[0:30] read daniel 9 verse 1 and see how this
[0:34] is how this is unfolding and the reason
[0:39] I'm so adamant about this listen to me
[0:41] we have been over this and over this and
[0:44] over this and over this for the past 20
[0:47] years and people killed own
[0:48] understanding we got to come to a place
[0:51] to where we understand this and this is
[0:52] more important this should be one of the
[0:54] most important subject brother branham
[0:56] says in the gables instructions and
[0:59] daniel he said right here i turned right
[1:00] to it he said this paragraph 1 13 this
[1:04] is the one most important scripture in
[1:06] the Bible I've got one 13 one most
[1:13] important scripture in the Bible why do
[1:15] we not read it why do we not try to
[1:16] understand it maybe we're like Israel we
[1:24] went whoring after other gods that's all
[1:27] of us it's not just one person's all of
[1:29] it me how much time do we spend studying
[1:34] brief everything else is the Bible and
[1:37] whatever some seventy weeks are
[1:39] determined upon thy people and upon the
[1:43] holy city no look here's what we got
[1:47] want you to make notes take you some
[1:48] notes and write this down seventy weeks
[1:51] are a tournament upon by people who is
[1:52] that the tube Daniel was a Jew so this
[1:56] is to Daniel's people and upon the holy
[1:59] city so there's two things because there
[2:02] are two things to until that's very very
[2:04] important number one their lineage that
[2:07] they're Jews number to that temple that
[2:10] city Jerusalem is the most holy place to
[2:13] them why do you think they're over there
[2:15] why do you think they're trying to dig
[2:17] under that mosque of Omar because that's
[2:19] the abomination that Jesus talked about
[2:22] in Matthew 24 sitting right where the
[2:24] temples erected I mean I said
[2:27] abomination is in the Bible okay so this
[2:29] is this and you say well what is it got
[2:33] to do with me well
[2:35] watch our hair we don't have a city
[2:39] Abraham never had a continuing City but
[2:42] we do have a city that's coming down out
[2:44] of heaven that we won't dwell in and
[2:45] unless we're going again you're not
[2:47] going well in that city so you're not
[2:49] warning in you don't have a city to go
[2:51] to if you're born again you have a city
[2:52] just like the Jews to go to we have a
[2:55] city which is New Jerusalem the Bible
[2:57] said right they come down out of heaven
[2:59] so we do have a spiritual Jerusalem but
[3:01] we are Gentiles are not included in this
[3:06] 70 weeks then I understand them because
[3:09] what look at your chart Thank You chart
[3:11] out from in this is the chart that
[3:15] brother Brown drew the week he preached
[3:18] the seventy weeks of Daniel now this is
[3:19] verified by brother George Smith that
[3:21] Rebecca is the one to drew this she drew
[3:24] it on the blackboard at the church and
[3:26] then she took him and drew it again and
[3:29] had it mimicked Raph those you look at
[3:32] that typing we don't talk like that
[3:33] anymore that's old type so this is an
[3:38] original copy not an original its
[3:40] original copy of what brother Brown drew
[3:43] in the series of things 70 weeks all
[3:45] right there's an updated one that
[3:47] Trudy's got that somebody did that's
[3:50] okay but this is the original dish was
[3:53] what was drawn by a brother branham in
[4:00] 1962 I guess when he preached this right
[4:02] so this is this is an original copy they
[4:06] come from the George Smith verified it
[4:09] daddy called him and he said yes that is
[4:11] Rebecca did every bit of them even if
[4:14] you'll read in your book brother Brown
[4:15] says room but sits and Becky that looks
[4:17] like a girl remember that's the Daniel
[4:22] that's the stone that's the guy that had
[4:25] to have a goal in the chest of brass and
[4:28] all that feet of iron all that stuff he
[4:30] said it looks like a girl he said but
[4:32] it's a better drawing than I can make if
[4:33] you reading you both this way said but
[4:35] look right here this is a gap see that
[4:39] gap that's where the Gentiles come in
[4:42] after the Jews rejected Christ at
[4:45] Calvary
[4:47] this is the Gentile age but this is the
[4:51] seventy weeks of Daniel that's what it's
[4:53] for the people and the city all right
[4:56] we're just remember we're grafted in
[5:00] right we're the one we're the wild one
[5:02] that was grafted in the olive trees
[5:04] always Israel we were grafted in because
[5:08] we're we accepted him as the bride he
[5:12] was just saying right here in Daniel I
[5:14] mean in jail I'm if you're gonna read
[5:16] chapter 3 next week we'll reach out to
[5:17] three he had to put her away because she
[5:22] went out and defiled herself with
[5:23] another man what another nation not a
[5:27] man a nation gonna say one thing alright
[5:29] so what he did he's they said let his
[5:32] blood be on us and our children when
[5:33] they crucified Him and then there's a
[5:35] gap in here will that gap it's what we
[5:38] get that gap is what we get not for the
[5:48] Jews because you got you weak over here
[5:51] you weak 62 in one more week left so we
[5:54] get into the animating a little while
[5:55] but seventy weeks are determined upon
[5:57] thy people who'd you and upon the holy
[6:01] city to do six things now inside this
[6:04] seventy weeks I want to do this come on
[6:06] emphasize this every time cuz it'll help
[6:08] us it will help us to realize that
[6:11] brother branham cannot break scripture
[6:13] he cannot Creek anything but what's in
[6:15] the Bible a man he's a word prophet he
[6:18] cannot preach anything outside the Bible
[6:20] hey man alright so seventy weeks are
[6:25] determined upon thy people and upon the
[6:26] holy city should do six things six
[6:29] things are going to happen inside of
[6:31] those seventy weeks now remember as we
[6:34] said before last Sunday are two Sundays
[6:39] ago
[6:41] that the 70 weeks naturally has already
[6:43] happened nobody there I got that the 70
[6:49] weeks has actually already happened
[6:51] because Daniel was in captivity he was
[6:54] in the 68 year of the captivity there
[6:58] was two more years before before Ezra
[7:01] and Nehemiah elmwood rebuild the temple
[7:03] will get into all that history layer
[7:05] rebuild the temple and Jews would go out
[7:07] of bondage that was 70 years natural
[7:12] natural but brother Ron said God thought
[7:16] so much of Daniel he included everything
[7:19] all the way to little millennium because
[7:22] truly the Jews are not going to come out
[7:23] of captivity until the Millennium right
[7:27] right truly the nation of Israel 144,000
[7:30] is not going to come out of captivity
[7:32] until the Millennium now will prove that
[7:34] a little bit later all right because
[7:35] they're still like that still blinded
[7:37] they're still in captivity that hundred
[7:39] forty-four thousand doesn't be preached
[7:40] to and brought out of captivity taking
[7:43] interactor and then come back in the
[7:44] Millennium so that's the culmination of
[7:47] the seventy weeks of Daniel according to
[7:52] this and this he's got to restore what
[7:55] people and the city he's got to restore
[7:58] both not just one both that's where
[8:01] people don't if you'll give if you get
[8:03] this revelation that this seventy weeks
[8:05] is for two things not one not just for
[8:08] the people is for the people and the
[8:10] rebuilding of the city a man comin into
[8:14] even in a millennium they're gonna have
[8:15] a natural temple built its ego 4244
[8:18] brother Brown said that's the natural
[8:19] temple being built in the Millennium
[8:22] alright so now so 70 research terminal
[8:26] on by people and upon the holy city so
[8:29] we know when I read that you're gonna
[8:30] stay Jews in Jerusalem right so he's
[8:34] going to restore two things inside of
[8:36] this and seventy weeks of that to do six
[8:39] things what is that to finish the
[8:41] transgression but the transgression they
[8:43] made will go through all these but you
[8:46] got to set a background to make an end
[8:47] of sin alright what preach the gospel to
[8:50] them save this all right
[8:52] and make reconciliation for iniquity
[8:57] restoration I like this too I was
[9:00] reading the commentary and the guy did a
[9:02] good job he's not even a message
[9:03] believer but he did the commentary he
[9:05] said he said these six things there's
[9:07] three negatives and three positives and
[9:11] that's true the negative is finished
[9:14] what transgression is a negative sin as
[9:16] a negative and iniquity is negative but
[9:18] righteousness is the positive vision is
[9:21] positive prophecy and the whole is is a
[9:23] positive so you got just like
[9:26] justification sanctification about
[9:27] enzyme a holy ghost what puts us in the
[9:30] body to make finish the transgression
[9:33] make an MCN reconcile their iniquity
[9:35] that saved Israel now to bring in
[9:37] everlasting righteousness means that all
[9:40] they're saying is finished alright seal
[9:43] up the vision and prophecy is this a
[9:45] vision right even jesus said coming down
[9:50] from the mountain we preached on the
[9:51] last sunday at brother Boone jesus said
[9:54] tell this vision to no man until the Son
[9:56] of Man be risen again well it was a
[9:58] natural happening but it was the vision
[10:00] there was a there was a meaning here in
[10:02] Daniel 70 weeks it's just like them it's
[10:05] just like a it's a parable just like the
[10:07] sort of the see this is the parable
[10:09] because seventy weeks are already over
[10:10] like I said the natural seventy weeks to
[10:13] the Jews are already over they already
[10:16] come out of captivity back then that was
[10:18] promised from Jeremiah we're reading
[10:21] next sunday when we'll get into Jeremiah
[10:22] free or we already ready for hand and
[10:25] eye on you note said two years will be
[10:27] gone and and all that stuff in Jeremiah
[10:29] said no 70 year all right so 70 70 years
[10:32] are seventy weeks are determined all
[10:35] right to do all and go north the most
[10:37] holy now let me just give you a little
[10:40] key to chew on because it's going to be
[10:42] six months before we get to this part
[10:44] but this seats whole purpose proves to
[10:47] you that there's one week left after the
[10:48] rapture of the church for the Jewish
[10:50] people not three and a half years I said
[10:55] natural earthly time because when the
[10:58] prophets finished preaching that 1260
[11:02] day Ministry of the two prophets of
[11:04] Israel
[11:05] in the middle of that last week what
[11:07] happens they get cut off and killed now
[11:11] were you going to get there relaxing
[11:12] righteousness while it's still down here
[11:14] under under bondage and there's no
[11:16] Battle of Armageddon how you going to
[11:18] knock the most holy in that three and a
[11:20] half year you can it's got to be a time
[11:23] left over a man it's where you going to
[11:27] get a whole week left the Bible says in
[11:28] the holy like all right cuz right here
[11:31] it is know that for and understand that
[11:33] from the going forth of the commandment
[11:35] to restore and to build jerusalem unto
[11:38] them aside and we'll get into the dates
[11:41] a little bit later on so from the
[11:44] restoration and rebuilding of Jerusalem
[11:46] unto who Jesus shall be seven weeks one
[11:52] period all right you want to make sure
[11:55] you should look on your chart brother
[11:58] Luigi okay I know I know okay below
[12:04] there's where your there's a seven-week
[12:06] period right there sixty two week period
[12:11] right there one week here here there's
[12:12] three periods she'll be seven weeks will
[12:17] tell you what goes on in flights divided
[12:18] okay and threescore and two what's three
[12:22] scoring 262 three score is three times
[12:25] two alright got that sixty two weeks the
[12:29] street shall be built again in a wall
[12:31] even in trouble this time and after
[12:34] sixty two weeks shall Messiah be cut off
[12:36] when at Calvary right after sixty two
[12:42] weeks on my size cut off you see it
[12:44] right here 8030 you see the cross
[12:46] program do the cross up there but not
[12:49] for himself in the pillion said but not
[12:55] for himself and the people to prance
[12:57] you're coming shoulders draw the city in
[12:58] sanctuary so now let's look the Jewish
[13:03] people their Redemption listen to them
[13:06] was destroyed at Calvary because they
[13:10] turn him down
[13:11] all right they cut him off chubby 72
[13:16] it's the streets revealed in Africa
[13:18] least 12 weeks shall Messiah be cut off
[13:20] what he was killed they said let his
[13:22] blood be on us on our children all right
[13:23] but not for himself he didn't get killed
[13:25] for itself he got killed for us man and
[13:28] the people the prince that shall come
[13:30] now that's not the same aside that's not
[13:33] that Prince that's a capital this Prince
[13:35] is a little and who was that Titus Titus
[13:38] came in in 80 70 and destroyed the city
[13:42] took the menorah took the holiest of
[13:45] Holies the art took everything and hold
[13:48] it back to Rome so you know who's got
[13:51] all that now Romans got it all Rome's
[13:55] got everything groans got every piece
[13:57] that Jerusalem are the Jews need to put
[13:59] that temple back together that's why and
[14:03] the sanctuary the end thereof should be
[14:06] with the flood to the end of the war
[14:07] desolations are determined and he shall
[14:09] confirm the covenant with many for one
[14:10] week now who's that little age
[14:14] Antichrist the Pope the Pope is going to
[14:18] make a covenant with meaning what many
[14:21] of the Jews Lashley's go make a covenant
[14:23] little boy in the world remember it's
[14:24] going to be peace and all that stuff and
[14:26] all he's coming in with flattery for how
[14:28] long one wig and brother branham said
[14:34] and we can prove it but we're going to
[14:36] go back into Jacob one week at seven
[14:40] years one week equals seven years if I
[14:45] got that so that's why you can take
[14:46] seven weeks 7 7 is 49 is on your chart
[14:52] hmm 49 year and three scoring 2 is 434
[14:57] so seven and 62 is 69 they were
[15:03] determined how many weeks 7d so there's
[15:07] one week left we don't see this covenant
[15:11] made with the Jews we've gone in a
[15:14] rapture so the Bible proves we can stop
[15:17] right there
[15:18] there's one there's one week left Africa
[15:20] after the search for the Jewish people
[15:22] and the city not for the three and a
[15:25] half year in ministry of jesus christ
[15:26] the 1260 days that's inside of the
[15:29] seventy weeks of Daniel but that's not
[15:31] all as most people in the message say
[15:35] there's only three and a half years left
[15:36] of Daniel seventy weeks after the
[15:37] rapture that is incorrect that is false
[15:39] and it's not true there's three and a
[15:42] half years of Jesus ministry the stream
[15:43] half years of tribulation but there's
[15:45] not three and a half of the season one
[15:47] my plan is the Bible I want to go by the
[15:50] Bible and he the Antichrist brother
[15:53] Graham said we do not see him make this
[15:55] covenant with the Jews were gone so
[15:57] there's one week left after the rapture
[15:59] of the church just exactly what he said
[16:00] and in the midst of the week how long is
[16:03] that three and a half years he shall
[16:07] cause the sacrifice and the oblation see
[16:09] what's going to happen is you know what
[16:10] he's going to do with this covenant
[16:11] brother right he's gonna give them their
[16:13] menorah he's going to give them their
[16:16] art he's going to give them the things
[16:18] and they're going to reestablish temple
[16:20] worship and then after three and a half
[16:22] years the Pope's going to walk into that
[16:25] temple and he's going to say no you're
[16:29] not going worship that God you're going
[16:31] to worship me I'm the god you're looking
[16:33] for the Antichrist but he's telling them
[16:36] he's the guy well guess what them Jews
[16:39] are not going to have a part of that at
[16:40] all so we going to cause the sacrifice
[16:44] an oblation to cease for the
[16:45] overspreading of abominations shall make
[16:47] it desolate even into the consummation
[16:48] and that term in shall be poured out on
[16:51] this desolate because remember after
[16:53] that 1260 days when the Jews take a
[16:55] rapture is the Battle of Armageddon
[16:57] right that's the next thing in order is
[17:00] the Battle of Armageddon so now that
[17:02] you've got all that you can chew on it a
[17:04] little while I know somebody's looking
[17:05] cross-eyed at me but that's okay because
[17:07] we're going to prove it by Daniel let's
[17:10] go to our book paragraph number one in
[17:14] the gables instruction
[17:15] today on first page first paragraph
[17:22] let's read it right here all right good
[17:25] morning friends is very hot being the
[17:27] tabernacle this morning but very
[17:28] glorious to be here so glad that we
[17:34] could can get in today for this service
[17:35] and I'm given out that I'd have a have a
[17:38] study now on this seventy weeks of
[17:40] Daniel that ties the rest of the message
[17:43] before I can go with the seal seven
[17:46] sealed which there seven seals seven
[17:48] plagues seven trumpets free woes woman
[17:51] in the Sun casting the other end dragon
[17:53] the 144,000 sealed all happening between
[17:56] this time what the Daniel seventy weeks
[17:59] yeah what he said and I thought I'd have
[18:03] to get this in first all right now let's
[18:05] go over to paragraph 27 let's go to 20
[18:15] let's read 22 because i want you to see
[18:16] what go road round says now now this
[18:20] morning we have a great lesson and
[18:22] tonight it will try to continue going if
[18:24] the Lord laying next Sunday another into
[18:27] it got it very got 22 capable
[18:31] instructions to Daniel we got 22 on page
[18:38] 22 paragraph 22 yeah that's one of this
[18:44] red now now this morning we have a great
[18:46] lesson there by got it very got 22 the
[18:50] paragraphs are always going to be the
[18:51] same paragraph 22 in paragraph 2622
[19:02] paragraph 22 don't worry about page
[19:03] numbers we're not going to call page
[19:05] numbers because they're not exactly the
[19:07] same paragraph 22 got it now now this
[19:13] morning we have a great lesson and
[19:15] tonight we'll try to continue it on and
[19:17] if the Lord willing next sunday and
[19:20] into it so what he's doing is this
[19:22] morning he's preaching on Gabriel
[19:24] construction to Daniel the afternoon
[19:26] service was the six full purpose and
[19:28] then he preaches on the seven two weeks
[19:30] ago next Sunday all right I want to get
[19:32] these things clear in our mind because
[19:34] listen this is a hard subject in the
[19:38] message for people to understand but let
[19:40] me tell you something so i got totally
[19:42] they got real mad at me but i really
[19:43] don't care see it matter to me when it
[19:46] comes to the Word of God listen if one
[19:47] word got us out of the garden if we're
[19:50] one word off its not going to not save
[19:51] your soul this is not Salvation issue
[19:53] but this is a growth issue if I got that
[19:57] not a Salvation issue you can be born
[20:00] again and never here at nine seventy
[20:01] weeks but long people have but you
[20:04] cannot maturing God because there's
[20:05] always going to be a question in your
[20:07] mind listen the problem with us is we
[20:10] have questions the thing about Jesus
[20:12] when he walked on the faces were earth
[20:14] he had 20 questions of who he was 0 man
[20:20] 0 we have questions but I want to try to
[20:25] answer one question that's in the
[20:27] people's mind brother ground said many
[20:28] times he said I'm trying to answer a
[20:30] question and people find all right
[20:33] sunday another in 2070 week I didn't
[20:36] know how deep it was getting until I got
[20:39] to studying it and it's still a mystery
[20:41] for me yet while the placing of those
[20:44] weeks now you'll see he'll say that he
[20:46] looked at dr. Yurok Smith dr. Larkin has
[20:49] a chart which I'm going to bring in it's
[20:51] close but it's not perfect it's close
[20:55] but you'll see where brother em says
[20:57] they're both they both they all have
[20:59] something a little off but one's brother
[21:00] Brown brought here to do top all loosen
[21:03] that means he didn't leave one man and
[21:08] it's still a mystery to me yet so I'm
[21:09] just depending on the Lord so now let's
[21:12] go to paragraph 27 forgot 27
[21:21] if I got her got 27 just looking through
[21:24] a little numbers down paragraph 27
[21:26] should say and now I think if the
[21:28] children want to go to the room all
[21:30] right in other words there are some of
[21:33] the Sunday School in the room for full
[21:34] people so nice so let's go down to says
[21:38] if the little fellas would cooperate
[21:39] with us as this morning we are having
[21:42] starting a great tremendous message you
[21:45] see nobody puts emphasis on the dance
[21:47] there in two weeks but this with a
[21:48] tremendous message to the profit that
[21:50] I'm sure that will mean a great deal to
[21:52] your father and mother and your loved
[21:54] ones that's here and even to you little
[21:56] one so we approach it very reverently
[22:00] all right let's go to a paragraph 29
[22:05] says next Sunday the lord willing I want
[22:08] to place the reason and the time of the
[22:11] seven church ages and what time they are
[22:13] and where we are standing today that's
[22:16] on next morn Sunday morning the Lord
[22:18] willing now here's a key read the next
[22:22] paragraph here third paragraph 30 now
[22:25] the reason for this I've brought down
[22:27] some little notes from my last few
[22:29] messages and this morning I want to lap
[22:32] over because this is on magnetic tape
[22:35] them go all over the world and always
[22:37] the reason I lap it back perhaps
[22:40] somebody listen to the table he says
[22:42] many many times even over on the next
[22:44] page will read next week he says lap
[22:47] over now why do you say lap over well
[22:49] look you've got left over here they got
[22:52] your chart he's got a lap over look 80
[22:56] 70 laps over end of the church age all
[22:59] right the Jews coming back is returning
[23:02] during the time of the Gentiles that's a
[23:04] lap over all your church ages have
[23:06] leftovers the church age is one didn't
[23:10] abruptly stopped in another one start
[23:11] you see the circles alright like this
[23:13] but those circles should be actually
[23:15] like this and I'm not trying
[23:16] your uncle the Holy Spirit drew the
[23:17] thing on the wall and I'm not trying to
[23:18] redraw it but brother Ram tops by lap
[23:21] over so there's a lap over and it will
[23:23] be very important when we get over here
[23:24] further for you to understand that God
[23:26] doesn't abruptly stop something and then
[23:29] start something else what he gives time
[23:33] remember he said you're going to be
[23:34] embodies for one of years well he give
[23:36] him for him 30 he lacked it over same
[23:40] way with here after Jesus was killed he
[23:42] given to 80 70 because remember jesus
[23:44] said in Matthew 24 he said if you see
[23:46] this abomination you get out of the city
[23:49] brother brahim said in AD 70 there was
[23:51] not one believer inside that city man
[23:55] there was not a holy ghost filled
[23:56] believer inside that city why they
[23:58] listen to what God said but the people
[24:01] that were in that city eat their babies
[24:02] to stay alive so you see what listening
[24:08] to what God said will do for you alright
[24:13] so there it's so lap over there's
[24:15] leftovers to all this all right back
[24:20] everyone's dead man hurts your
[24:23] feelings cuz you know one he's giving me
[24:24] time he's giving you time he's give all
[24:27] of us time man so we we I like it when
[24:30] he says lap over you know what lap over
[24:32] does write your lap went like a
[24:34] stair-step never brother I'm said you
[24:36] can't build a stair set without what
[24:37] building one on top of the other one
[24:39] well this is your lap over right here to
[24:42] build the next step then there's another
[24:44] lap over sitting on top of that step to
[24:46] build an excellent so you know got it
[24:48] you know what to me the lap of rest grac
[24:51] e the lap over is grave do you know why
[24:54] brother Graham said if I Scott I just
[24:56] say you're gonna do if you don't
[24:57] did that day you're done right you know
[24:59] what he said he said I was God I'd say
[25:01] you believe me one time and forget it
[25:03] that's what he said he said but God is
[25:06] gracious and he give this time so we
[25:07] have a lap over in the church ages and
[25:11] lap over in the damn Cemetery so now
[25:13] let's go to paragraph 31 now this is
[25:16] going to be very important right here I
[25:18] got 31 says we have been now for months
[25:24] everybody got that we have been now from
[25:27] us in the state of the book of
[25:28] Revelation to revelation of Jesus Christ
[25:29] remember he came right out of the church
[25:31] agents and preached this a little bit
[25:33] later three student he's been on the
[25:36] church ages and now he's come into that
[25:38] instead of the week we have been out for
[25:40] months in the study of the book of
[25:42] Revelation the revelation of Jesus
[25:44] Christ we have come through the church
[25:46] ages the first three chapters of
[25:47] Revelation was the church ages then John
[25:51] was caught up in the fourth and fifth
[25:52] chapter and was show things that was to
[25:55] be here after now in the sixth chapter
[25:59] he drops down in the earth again the
[26:02] seating is taking place that will go
[26:04] from the sixth chapter the first verse
[26:05] until the nineteenth chapter in the 21st
[26:08] verse in here comes in two seals to
[26:11] place the oils the locusts one and some
[26:13] cash cow red dragon sitting away up
[26:15] 144,000 and all these things alright
[26:19] then I understand that one of these
[26:21] revelations one program city the bride
[26:25] takes a rapture revelations for one
[26:26] member he joins caught up and then in
[26:30] four and five shows where he's at shows
[26:34] how they got their revelations five
[26:35] that's Redemption but revelation 6 1 is
[26:38] to the Jews you say well the seals are
[26:40] us the spiritual part of the deal to
[26:42] rise the natural partner to the Jews but
[26:45] from revelation 6 12 revelations 1921 is
[26:48] all Jewish you said what about
[26:50] revelation 10-7 dunno mighty angel go
[26:54] over there
[26:56] that the mighty angel come down the
[26:59] Bible says even in daniel says that
[27:01] Michael the mighty angel will fight for
[27:03] Israel will there's revelation 10m
[27:04] coming down you should all what about
[27:07] level revelation 10-7 John is telling us
[27:09] how how it transpired in the days of the
[27:13] voice of the seventh angel in other
[27:15] words wouldn't get a revelation of the
[27:16] mystery and it will cause all these
[27:18] things to happen very simple to me but
[27:21] it needs to be simple to you too and
[27:23] fuel pray ought to make it simple that's
[27:25] right but I'm not a smart guy you know
[27:27] that I just try to read and stay listen
[27:30] to what the Lord said and you do the
[27:32] same thing do you know why you don't
[27:33] just speak to me speak to y'all all
[27:37] right thing everybody got that
[27:41] revelations for one or even revelation 6
[27:44] to revelations 19 is to the Jews and it
[27:47] happens in this 70th week of Daniel if I
[27:50] got that right
[28:02] alright let's read paragraph 2 36 and
[28:06] then we'll stop right there will read
[28:09] paragraph 36 and 37 and then I won't
[28:12] open up by five minutes per question we
[28:16] got 36 and different ones has figured it
[28:18] out they've had it way back one fell I
[28:20] was reading and it all ended up in 1919
[28:23] of the 70 weeks well that wasn't so
[28:27] after 17 weeks after 70 weeks it's
[28:30] authentic so we don't we want to know
[28:34] the truth and I'm asking God to give me
[28:36] the trip now in order to go to back this
[28:38] up go back I want to rehearse a little
[28:40] bit of the back so therefore some notes
[28:43] that i jot it down that we have in the
[28:44] fifth for the fifth chapter which people
[28:46] will understand first before we do this
[28:49] I want to lap it over so that you can
[28:51] get it from the fort now remember the
[28:53] third chapter was allowed to interchange
[28:55] and the church was taken up at the up at
[28:58] the end of layout of the cell alright
[29:04] let's read now paragraph 40 now what
[29:08] happens is brother branham why me this
[29:12] is how do you expect our people which
[29:14] are pouring mandame uneducated to
[29:15] understand such as this very got 40 I
[29:18] said God will give the answer alright so
[29:22] we depend on God to give us the answer
[29:23] no matter how complicated it is God can
[29:26] break it down and make it simple for
[29:27] where a portion of those people who are
[29:30] longing praying for that day in that
[29:32] hour and our eyes are set towards heaven
[29:34] and we're watching friends coming and
[29:36] I'm just sure that he will show us now
[29:40] it won't tell us the day or hour because
[29:42] no man knows that but it will certainly
[29:44] tell us the day on the week we're living
[29:46] if we can just get to it alright so we
[29:52] kind of covered a lot today but it will
[29:54] go to back up we're going to lap over
[29:55] ourselves and we will start next Sunday
[30:00] on Daniel 9 verse 1 because see what
[30:03] happened is
[30:04] Daniel goes to pray it he verse 3 I set
[30:08] my face until the Lord garden seat by
[30:10] prayer and supplication with fasting in
[30:11] sackcloth and ashes Daniel confessed his
[30:16] sins maybe that's what we ought to do
[30:17] maybe already clear our you know get her
[30:19] you're a plate clear as we say and and
[30:22] ask God to forgive us of our sins they
[30:24] will speak to you got sending you left
[30:27] remember what brother Brown said he said
[30:30] you won't get your healing unless you
[30:31] take care of that right there so that's
[30:33] what we're stopping that lady or whoever
[30:35] it was to getting from getting healed
[30:36] plus some time confess sin so let's just
[30:40] kind of clear everything up and you know
[30:42] what then God's obligated he's obligated
[30:46] to show it to us in a simple form that
[30:48] will all be able to understand it all
[30:50] right any questions one would you prefer
[30:55] to study ahead or stay with you you read
[30:59] the book I want you to read the book so
[31:01] you're familiar with the book keep just
[31:03] read the whole book make a little note
[31:05] drop things down and do like that said
[31:07] when he first read it you put question
[31:08] marks beside me you know he started
[31:11] reading the book he put a question mark
[31:12] and then maybe we can answer that
[31:14] question but I want you to read and be
[31:16] familiar with all three services
[31:20] together so listen listen to them at
[31:24] home or watch them on your computer at
[31:26] home and then you leave your book here
[31:27] if you want to do that but whichever one
[31:29] to make this a little note because you
[31:31] know what listen there's got to be
[31:33] questions because we were covering this
[31:34] over and over and over again I know we
[31:37] got some new people here but we keep
[31:38] covering this we covered it for 30-some
[31:41] years that had some people still don't
[31:43] really try to really try to understand
[31:45] it I think we have to try to understand
[31:46] this and get it in our mind that when we
[31:48] go out there and talk to people and they
[31:50] said well you know that's the first
[31:52] thing they tell you well brother don't
[31:53] believe there's only three and a half
[31:54] years left
[31:55] the raptor that's not true that's not
[32:00] true I mean brother Dale bleeds or seven
[32:02] years left after after there is there's
[32:04] not just three and a half years of
[32:05] ministry there's only three and a half
[32:07] years of ministry left corner in the
[32:08] Bible but according to the Bible we just
[32:10] read there's one week left after that
[32:12] Antichrist makes a covenant with a juice
[32:15] so Bible's Bible brother Brown said face
[32:19] final resting places in the word were
[32:21] you letting the word but brother branham
[32:23] I promise you didn't say anything
[32:24] different than the word you just
[32:25] misunderstood when said well like he
[32:29] said somebody said you said seven years
[32:33] he sit down no no no no no you
[32:35] misunderstood okay he knew that person
[32:39] was were taken we don't do that he knew
[32:42] that person was thinking there were
[32:44] seven years men left and there's not
[32:48] just threaten thats what stops everybody
[32:50] we read all the quotes for the ones that
[32:52] they bring and I don't like that they
[32:53] had weed but the one that they bring you
[32:55] know it's true but he never said no no
[33:00] no no this is my whole point my brother
[33:03] branham went to the seven seals there
[33:06] were some things that he was preaching
[33:08] that was wrong and God corrected him and
[33:09] he told us that God corrected him never
[33:12] in that book find me one place where he
[33:15] said I was wrong and Daniel Pham you
[33:16] waiting find me one place he said no no
[33:20] no same quote no no no he said you
[33:21] misunderstood what I said I didn't say
[33:25] it like that in other words he said that
[33:26] God I misunderstood whether that he said
[33:29] it was wrong hey I came across one just
[33:36] the other day that I had not read and
[33:37] they had an underline and bold letters
[33:39] brother Ram said that's what the Holy
[33:41] Spirit put on my pan to ride that they
[33:43] would one week left Africa after sure
[33:44] you hire you with the Holy Ghost are you
[33:45] okay I'm not going to argue with it the
[33:48] person was sad drennan seven years
[33:51] ministry and it's not going to help you
[33:55] all right let's go
