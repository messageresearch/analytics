[4:32] name
[4:33] amen amen praise the Lord Saints Oh
[4:36] if the brothers could just bring up the
[4:38] the scripture amen so we're gonna read
[4:44] from the from first Peter chapter 2
[4:47] first Peter chapter 2 verses 9 through
[4:50] 17 but ye are a chosen generation a
[4:57] royal priesthood an holy nation a
[5:00] peculiar people that ye should show
[5:04] forth the praises of him who hath called
[5:06] you out of darkness into his marvelous
[5:09] light which in time past were not a
[5:11] people but are now the people of God
[5:14] which had not obtained mercy but now
[5:17] have obtained mercy wonderful things we
[5:22] have the the the things that God says
[5:24] Thaksin says about us and that Peter
[5:27] talks about here but watch what these
[5:29] people have to do dearly beloved I
[5:31] beseech you as strangers and pilgrims
[5:32] abstain from fleshly lusts which war
[5:35] against the soul having your
[5:38] conversation honest among the Gentiles
[5:40] that whereas they speak against you as
[5:42] evildoers they may by your good works
[5:44] which they shall behold glorify God in
[5:48] the day of visitation now watch this
[5:51] submit yourselves to every ordinance of
[5:54] man for the lord's sake even you don't
[5:58] have to agree with it but for the lord's
[6:00] sake submit unto it whether it be to the
[6:04] king as supreme or unto governors as
[6:06] unto them that are sent by him for the
[6:09] punishment of evildoers and for the
[6:11] praise of them that do well for so is
[6:14] the will of God that with well doing you
[6:18] may put to silence the ignorance of
[6:21] foolish men as free and not using your
[6:25] liberty for a cloak of maliciousness but
[6:28] as the servants of God verse 17 honor
[6:32] all men not some man not the ones that
[6:37] you like not the ones that do you good
[6:40] not the ones that shake your hand
[6:42] it says honor all man love the
[6:46] other hood all right fear God and honor
[6:52] the king and all these things that that
[6:56] Peter is talking about here in verse 17
[6:59] has to do with respect and Submission
[7:02] amen so that's what I want to talk about
[7:04] this evening about the power of respect
[7:06] and submission so you may have as your
[7:09] seats to see me praise God
[7:12] so the brothers could bring up a little
[7:15] slide the little slides you know Saints
[7:21] lately about two weeks ago when brother
[7:24] Bob was preaching as a matter of fact I
[7:26] was back in the back and there was
[7:29] something I don't know it was something
[7:31] that he said or I can't remember exactly
[7:34] what it was but but it was uh and
[7:39] something just came to my mind and it
[7:41] took me back to that message that
[7:42] brother Branham preached called respects
[7:44] and if you'd haven't listened to its
[7:47] 1961
[7:48] it's called respects and a really good
[7:51] message where he talks about how
[7:54] respecting in this respect and took
[7:56] place in the scriptures and the
[7:59] consequences of it or the or the
[8:01] blessings thereof and so in the last
[8:04] several weeks just the Lord has been
[8:06] dealing with me on this on this line and
[8:09] really Saints if you take a look at it
[8:12] because in the Indy and then in them in
[8:15] today's and the day that we live in all
[8:20] we see is disrespect everywhere there's
[8:24] no respect for authority
[8:26] I mean you drive you that Drive you know
[8:29] you you see the disrespect if you just
[8:33] go right here and just drive down here
[8:35] down down nine eighty five you'll just
[8:37] see that this respect I mean people are
[8:39] just disrespectful everywhere and and
[8:42] and this just become a common thing in
[8:45] people's lives and so it becomes also
[8:49] it's such is so common in people's lives
[8:52] that it also comes in and infiltrates in
[8:54] the inside the church and we come and we
[8:57] disrespect one another not not
[9:00] desiring to but we do it and we don't
[9:04] even know that we're doing it and the
[9:07] whole scripture from Genesis to
[9:09] Revelation talks about it is we'll bring
[9:12] it up in just a moment but it is one of
[9:14] the center themes of the Bible as a
[9:17] matter of fact Redemption because we
[9:20] know that Redemption is is the whole
[9:21] core of the word redemption couldn't
[9:25] even have happened if there was no
[9:26] respect or submission involved do you
[9:29] see what I'm saying so respect is a very
[9:32] important thing if the world out there
[9:35] does it and they're not even believers
[9:37] without the Holy Spirit people people do
[9:41] it how much more the believer who
[9:43] supposed to be filled with the Holy
[9:44] Spirit who has the author of respect and
[9:47] submission in us how much more shouldn't
[9:50] we do it and so we engage in all kinds
[9:53] of disrespect even amongst us we engage
[9:57] in all kinds of disrespect and we do not
[10:00] even realize it
[10:02] and I and and really if you think about
[10:06] it if we're created in the image of God
[10:08] and if we're sons and daughters of God
[10:10] and that that life of God is in you and
[10:12] I now I got a quote for this where the
[10:15] Browns said that if is if you disrespect
[10:18] one another you're disrespecting God
[10:20] that's a direct quote from God from it
[10:23] from brother Branham so so let's just
[10:26] look at this here and that I hope that
[10:27] you learn something and not just learn
[10:29] it but it would help you to apply into
[10:32] your into your daily life and I would
[10:34] ask you all there just be respectful
[10:37] this evening and listen please if you're
[10:41] falling asleep shake it off and because
[10:46] that's just respect for me do you see
[10:48] what I'm saying that's just respect for
[10:50] me and it's respect for the Lord amen
[10:53] because I believe that God has something
[10:55] for each and every one of us I know that
[10:56] some you know we need to hear these
[11:01] things from from time to time
[11:02] Paul covered them brother Branham
[11:05] covered it so I believe that we need to
[11:07] cover it so so let's just look at this
[11:09] here
[11:10] in the power of respect and Submission
[11:14] go to the next next one so let's just
[11:17] look at a couple of quotes here and not
[11:19] just quotes from brother Branham but the
[11:21] brother branham said the only way that
[11:23] you can respect God is to respect one
[11:25] another the only way now confucius said
[11:33] without feelings of respect
[11:35] what is there to distinguish men from
[11:38] beasts without you having that sense of
[11:41] respect because even even and I kind of
[11:44] thought about that but even animals
[11:46] respect one another I heard one time I
[11:50] was listening to something recently and
[11:51] there was a there was a somebody
[11:54] speaking about the Eagles in in Montana
[11:57] and how when they go and fish for salmon
[11:59] and stuff like that they actually wait
[12:02] till the salmon actually spawns before
[12:05] they actually go and get the salmon to
[12:07] eat there's a respect there even from
[12:11] the animal kingdom yet when we go by
[12:15] each other we don't even say anything to
[12:16] each other
[12:18] somebody's sick somebody needs some help
[12:21] somebody needs and we just I got to go
[12:24] to the car I got to do this that and the
[12:25] other oh you got a little quiet but
[12:30] that's true we need to respect one
[12:33] another I speak to everyone in the same
[12:37] way whether he is in the in the guard
[12:40] whether he is the garbage man or the
[12:42] president of the university Albert
[12:44] Einstein said this one of the smartest
[12:47] men in the world
[12:48] respect is one of the greatest
[12:50] expressions of love
[12:52] miellyn Hilary's submission is not and
[12:56] this is one about submission submission
[12:58] is not about Authority and it's not
[13:00] obedience it is all about relationships
[13:04] of love and respect so that is some
[13:09] notable quotes and if we can we can go
[13:11] to the next slide now the theme of
[13:13] respect and Submission is throughout the
[13:16] entire Bible as I just mentioned it and
[13:18] the core of the word is
[13:20] Densham but there cannot be any
[13:23] redemption unless there's respect and
[13:24] Submission involved and I have Jesus
[13:26] Christ here because that's the ultimate
[13:28] of risk that shown respect and yet
[13:33] submissive he didn't want to die this is
[13:38] like any other man he even he even tried
[13:40] to see if he could get out of it as a
[13:42] man he prayed to God and he said lord if
[13:45] this cup can pass from me but let it be
[13:49] not my will but thy will be done and he
[13:54] submitted to the will of God that was a
[13:57] hard thing to go through I don't think
[13:59] any man none of you have ever gone
[14:01] through anything like he did that was
[14:04] the hardest thing that you could ever to
[14:06] think that you're gonna die for all
[14:09] humanity for the sins of all humanity
[14:11] and and and yet you you were sinless you
[14:17] were spotless and you were being
[14:18] punished for something that you didn't
[14:19] even even do accused of things that you
[14:22] didn't even do and yet he was he was
[14:24] taking all that for you and I because he
[14:28] was thinking about some of us he died
[14:32] for the whole world but he knew who he
[14:33] was down for for sure
[14:35] Amen Philippians 2:8 says and being
[14:38] found in fashion as a man he humbled
[14:41] himself and became obedient unto death
[14:44] even the death of the cross amen
[14:48] next slide since Jesus Christ is the
[14:55] word and how many can can you all see
[14:56] this in the back I don't know if I need
[14:58] to turn off lights here but okay if you
[15:02] can't see it just let me know and if you
[15:04] want a copy of this and be more than
[15:05] glad to give you a copy since Jesus
[15:07] Christ is the word he was the ultimate
[15:09] example of respect and Submission even
[15:12] when he was incredibly disrespected
[15:14] first Peter 2:23 who when he was reviled
[15:17] revolved not again when he suffered he
[15:20] threatened not but committed himself to
[15:23] him that judgeth righteously you know to
[15:25] the man to regular common man we think
[15:28] you know when we think in the lines of
[15:30] the Old Testament tooth for a tooth eye
[15:33] for an eye
[15:34] and we like that us and our natural mind
[15:38] oh yeah I like it they do it to me I'm
[15:40] gonna do it to them but that's not what
[15:43] Jesus Christ didn't remember he's the
[15:46] ultimate of submission and respect amen
[15:50] hmm the next slide
[15:53] appreciate the brothers in the back so
[15:55] what is respect respect is a feeling of
[15:58] deep admiration for someone or something
[16:01] elicited by their abilities qualities or
[16:04] achievements do regard for the feelings
[16:06] wishes rights or traditions of others in
[16:10] other words if you see something a
[16:12] different way or if you grew up in a
[16:13] different way just because you grew up
[16:15] that way doesn't mean that the other
[16:17] person they grew up on the side of the
[16:18] world doesn't mean that they're wrong
[16:19] you see just because you grew up here in
[16:23] the South doesn't mean that the one that
[16:24] grew up out west is wrong doesn't mean
[16:28] that the one that grew up in Mexico or
[16:30] the one that grew up in Colombia because
[16:31] your tradition that's your tradition and
[16:34] I must respect that tradition just as
[16:36] much as you need to respect mine do you
[16:39] see praise God
[16:41] respect also means to acknowledge
[16:43] someone their labors or even their
[16:45] presence I'm shocked that so many times
[16:50] that you're in a room with somebody and
[16:52] they don't even acknowledge that you're
[16:53] there and most importantly if it's an
[16:56] elder the Bible actually talks about
[16:59] elders if you disrespect elders they
[17:02] would stone people who would disrespect
[17:05] elders elders need to be respected in
[17:08] the higher in a higher way they may not
[17:14] you know you may not agree with them and
[17:16] you may you may not you may not be
[17:18] friends with them but there's a certain
[17:20] reverence that goes that goes towards
[17:23] them when you're around them I'm talking
[17:26] to everybody there's a certain river I
[17:29] grew up learning it was just a
[17:31] common-sense thing that when you come
[17:34] around around an elder or somebody older
[17:37] than you oh god bless you or hello shake
[17:39] their hand but I'm shocked at somebody
[17:45] you go around some people now
[17:47] days and they just don't even go there
[17:53] Mary wait all right I understand you
[17:56] don't want to shake my hand you don't
[17:58] want that that's fine but when an elder
[18:00] gets around you that's a different story
[18:03] they deserve respect they deserve that
[18:05] you deserve honor all right
[18:11] what is respecting the feeling or act by
[18:14] which you show someone how valuable they
[18:16] are to you so when you don't respect
[18:19] somebody when when I go around brother
[18:22] Zack and I don't you know and I'm
[18:23] clearly in front of him and I don't
[18:26] shake his hand
[18:27] I'm trying what I'm saying or why I'm
[18:30] conveying to him is that your feelings
[18:32] don't matter to me
[18:33] you were no value to me I don't care if
[18:36] you're right there this is exactly what
[18:39] you're portraying without saying it
[18:43] without saying and that's a disrespect
[18:48] to God because he was created in the
[18:52] image of God he was created in the image
[18:55] of God she was created in the image of
[18:57] God he's created in the majora every one
[18:59] of us in here including the unsaved
[19:02] person was created in the image of God
[19:04] and they deserve just as much with
[19:06] respect as he does he does but the Bible
[19:09] says and we're ready here just a little
[19:11] bit that more the ones in the household
[19:13] of faith because why their brethren they
[19:19] have the same spirit that you and that
[19:20] you should have a man to see honor see
[19:24] potential to show honor praise God you
[19:28] know we grow up and we hear you must
[19:30] respect your elders you must but it just
[19:32] becomes a mantra the golden rule and all
[19:36] these things but when you actually start
[19:38] looking at these things in the Bible and
[19:40] then you actually look at how the Jews
[19:43] see these things impressed me the things
[19:46] that I have found out in the last
[19:47] several days and and it's challenged me
[19:49] and I hope it challenges you tonight I
[19:52] want to be more respectful because I
[19:55] have many times I've failed in this area
[19:57] I've filled in and I just
[20:00] because brother Boyd was MIT has been
[20:02] preaching about revival Amen that that's
[20:05] an element of revival if you're not
[20:09] respecting one another don't expect the
[20:11] revival if you're you you may read the
[20:15] word you may you may study you may pray
[20:18] but if you come to tried the house of
[20:20] God disrespecting one another joking
[20:22] around one another making light of each
[20:24] other and things like that you are not
[20:26] good don't expect the revival but I
[20:29] believe God wants to give us a revival
[20:31] I believe God I believe God is working
[20:33] in each and every one of us Amen and we
[20:35] get that individual revival Amen and if
[20:39] it expresses itself on the outside out
[20:42] here and somebody gets up shouts dance
[20:44] speaks and Tugg praise the Lord for that
[20:45] - hey man I know that's not the revival
[20:49] but hey you know we need that sometimes
[20:51] praise God alright next one and now what
[20:57] is submission submission is the action
[20:59] or fact of accepting or yielding to a
[21:02] superior force or to the will or
[21:04] authority of another person or entity
[21:06] amen and to obey as well because this
[21:11] can this can be this can be nice but
[21:13] that it can also be not no not nice so
[21:16] Luke 1:38 says and Mary said Behold the
[21:20] handmaid of the Lord be it unto me
[21:22] according to that word a man she didn't
[21:25] understand what the angel was head said
[21:27] she and she was trying to reason it out
[21:31] because why he had never happened before
[21:33] that's why she wasn't struck dumb when
[21:36] she asked the angel you know why why is
[21:40] how can this happen yet yet John the
[21:43] Baptist dad was because that had already
[21:45] happened before in Sarah and Abraham and
[21:49] he was questioning it but here's Mary
[21:52] this had never happened before but she
[21:54] just said be it unto me according to
[21:57] that one amen so that's what submission
[22:00] is just submitting yourself and then
[22:03] giving yourself yielding yourself and
[22:05] obeying a man next one how many are
[22:09] still with me amen respect and
[22:12] Submission is directly linked to life
[22:14] what's Genesis 1:27 so God created man
[22:17] in his own image in the image of God
[22:19] created he him male and female created
[22:20] he them so they are in his image all
[22:24] right every man that was created every
[22:27] man on the face of the earth is created
[22:29] in God's image therefore every man needs
[22:32] to be respected
[22:34] some have levels of respect a man that
[22:37] you give but every man deserves a
[22:40] respect again you may not agree with
[22:43] them I don't agree with everything that
[22:45] mr. Trump uh does or anything like that
[22:49] but I respect him as a person and I
[22:52] respect him for the position that he
[22:54] holds right you know some point in time
[22:57] one point in time I didn't understand
[22:58] that because when I was looking at I I
[23:00] got caught up back in the early 2000s
[23:03] but you know after 9/11 took place and
[23:05] all that with you know the government
[23:08] things and conspiracy things and stuff
[23:10] like that and I started becoming very
[23:12] rebellious towards the government
[23:13] towards things in life in general and I
[23:17] had to I had to come to myself and shake
[23:19] myself and say Lord this is not your
[23:22] Holy Spirit as much as true that some of
[23:25] that stuff could be but it's not leading
[23:28] me to you and I had to shake it off I
[23:31] had to completely shake it off because
[23:34] it was it was causing me to disrespect
[23:36] the government authorities and thoughts
[23:39] stuff like that and and a lady assist I
[23:41] was preaching that brother Benny parish
[23:42] church one time in South Carolina and
[23:44] she came to after the service and and
[23:47] she was taller talking about how the the
[23:49] local government was so corrupt and how
[23:52] something about the water system and all
[23:55] that stuff and I said I said sister
[23:57] listen I've been through and I know
[23:59] exactly what you're going what you're
[24:00] thinking and what you're experiencing
[24:02] I've been there done that
[24:04] matter of fact Satan is trying to bring
[24:05] you through a rabbit hole right now all
[24:09] right and if you're not careful you're
[24:11] gonna end up like those people out there
[24:13] protesting and all that kind of stuff
[24:15] and it's absolutely anti-god
[24:18] it's absolutely anti anti holy spirit
[24:23] for I I don't see a true
[24:26] born-again Christian out there
[24:28] protesting and stuff like that let God
[24:30] deal with thing do you have to think
[24:32] about that what's happen ever is
[24:34] happening on earth it's because God is
[24:37] allowing it I know only to fulfill his
[24:41] word and to prepare his bride you see so
[24:45] just just whether he uses the government
[24:48] or a jihadist from the Saudi Arabia it
[24:50] doesn't matter to me
[24:51] but God's fulfilling his word that's the
[24:55] most important thing how do I get to
[24:57] that from the image of man to Jay
[25:00] hottest in Saudi Arabia now in the Torah
[25:05] the Jews firmly believed that life
[25:08] should be respected no matter if it's
[25:12] human life animal life or plant life and
[25:14] watch this this is because all life
[25:17] comes from God and life is a gift to all
[25:20] living beings to them if you go and and
[25:23] and and and to a lot of people if you go
[25:26] and tear a leaf from from a tree that's
[25:29] a disrespect to that leaf disrespect to
[25:32] that tree because that was life you see
[25:35] and for us it's not nothing but to
[25:39] something some people that's life
[25:41] our life comes from God so there's a
[25:43] level of respect there doesn't mean I
[25:46] won't do it but I'm just saying you know
[25:48] that's what they believe Genesis 9:6
[25:51] whoso sheddeth man's blood by man shall
[25:54] his blood be shed now I want you to look
[25:57] at this God did not say that whoso
[26:00] sheddeth man's blood I will shed that
[26:03] man's blood no he didn't say that he was
[26:07] saying the consequence of that if you
[26:10] said man's blood your blood is going to
[26:13] be shed as well for in the image of God
[26:17] made He Man all right so there's a
[26:20] respect that must go a man when when and
[26:24] we'll look at Cain and Abel here in just
[26:26] just a moment Cain was complete
[26:28] disrespect to his brother of course he
[26:31] did what he what he did next
[26:37] all right now first Peter we just now
[26:40] got to got done reading so here I'm not
[26:42] going to talk about this too much but
[26:45] Peter refers to us being us chosen
[26:47] generation a royal priesthood a holy
[26:49] nation peculiar people and the people of
[26:52] God and we jump and shout and scream
[26:55] whenever we hear those verses we love
[26:58] them oh yeah praise God because we are
[27:01] that is us that is us but then watch
[27:05] what Peter continues to saying yet what
[27:07] these wonderful statuses comes the
[27:09] responsibility to demonstrate respect
[27:11] and Submission you can be all of this
[27:15] but if you don't respect and submit what
[27:19] is all that what is all that t you can
[27:22] know all mysteries and not have love
[27:24] what does all that can do for you you
[27:27] see first Peter 2:13 says submit
[27:30] yourselves to every ordinance of man for
[27:34] the lord's sake now obviously Saints
[27:38] there is there is things that you know
[27:41] the abortion you know we don't agree
[27:44] with that I don't you know I think that
[27:48] that's taken a life you know and there's
[27:51] there's ordinances I mean I can go in
[27:52] there the difference between laws
[27:54] ordinances and and and the different
[27:57] there's another one there is well
[27:58] legislation I think or something but
[28:01] Peter here is talking about ordinances
[28:05] being maybe local ordinances because
[28:08] ordinances being local locally you see
[28:11] that's what paint laws that we follow
[28:13] locally here in the city of Lula those
[28:16] are ordinances but they must obey they
[28:19] must go by the higher law of the land
[28:23] they can't overrule the higher law of
[28:25] the land you see so every law is
[28:27] submitted to every other law to the
[28:30] supreme law which is the constitution
[28:32] and you see there's God next next one
[28:36] and Peter continues saying for so verse
[28:40] 15 for so is the will of God that with
[28:43] well doing you may put to silence the
[28:45] ignorance of foolish man in other words
[28:48] you may not agree as I'm
[28:50] driving down the road and then that it
[28:52] says I need to go 70 miles of hours at
[28:55] 70 miles per hour that's the speed limit
[28:57] I don't agree with that sometimes I feel
[29:00] like I can easily go 80 or 85 right and
[29:05] some of you are laughing because you
[29:07] know it's the truth but you know what as
[29:10] much as safe as it is for me to do it
[29:13] the law states that I cannot go past 70
[29:17] right
[29:19] therefore if somebody else if I have a
[29:22] brother with me or somebody else from
[29:24] out another country that's riding with
[29:26] me and I'm going 85 on a 70 mile per
[29:28] hour zone he or she knows that I've
[29:31] become a stumbling block to them
[29:33] technically you have you're disobeying
[29:36] this scripture all right
[29:41] so obeying every ordinance for the sake
[29:45] of for the sake of the Lord right that
[29:49] with well doing you may put to silence
[29:50] the ignorance of foolish man or look at
[29:52] that they believe they believe that that
[29:54] and the other but I can't put my finger
[29:56] on there man they they they really do
[29:59] what they say they obey the law they
[30:01] they respect one another but I don't
[30:03] agree with what they believe but I did I
[30:06] respect them in any way so you see
[30:09] that's what Peters talking about as free
[30:11] and not using your liberty for a cloak
[30:13] of militias but as the servants of God
[30:15] see we're all we were we were chosen
[30:19] generation a royal priesthood holy
[30:21] nation peculiar people the people of God
[30:23] but we are the servants of God all right
[30:27] honor all men love the Brotherhood fear
[30:31] God honor the king amen
[30:34] next slide all right now in looking at
[30:40] that word honor the word honor is in the
[30:42] Greek there in that previous verse that
[30:44] we just read there is the word team out
[30:46] which means properly assigned value as
[30:49] it reflects the personal esteem value
[30:51] preciousness attached to by the but by
[30:53] the beholder now we saw the same word
[30:56] being used when Jesus said in Matthew 15
[30:59] for for god commanded saying honour died
[31:03] father and mother it's the exact same
[31:05] word go back to the previous slide
[31:09] brother honor all man next next slide
[31:14] honor thy father and mother it's the
[31:18] exact same word it's properly assigning
[31:21] value see so when you as I'm talking to
[31:25] our young people I'm talking to children
[31:27] when you dishonor your mom and dad that
[31:30] God for first and foremost God created
[31:33] God put here on this earth so they're
[31:34] created in the image of God
[31:36] next they were placed there to watch
[31:39] over you as you are growing up right we
[31:44] discussed this a little bit on Saturday
[31:46] on the under and the youth during the
[31:47] youth study that we had but the other
[31:51] thing is is that you have they have of
[31:55] you they have a value they have to have
[31:57] a value in your eyes whether they are
[32:00] wrong or not whether you disagree with
[32:03] them or not they are they have a certain
[32:06] value and then once you once you
[32:10] dishonor them you're taking that value
[32:12] in other words in your eyes that value
[32:14] is not there for them and it can be you
[32:17] can be any sort of dishonor in any sort
[32:20] of dishonor talking back to them talking
[32:23] about them tricking them lying to them
[32:30] disobeying them that is all forms of
[32:33] dishonor to your parents and I could
[32:37] just the list could go on more being
[32:39] sneaky hiding things from them again I
[32:43] told you young people I said that if God
[32:46] loves you every sneaky thing that you do
[32:48] God will find out God God will make sure
[32:51] that it's revealed and I'll be the first
[32:54] one to say amen to that as I was growing
[32:57] up why because God loved me and I was
[33:03] not going to get away with anything that
[33:05] would dishonor my parents and I made
[33:09] sure that I didn't get away but you know
[33:11] what thank God that I grew up in a home
[33:14] where my mom and dad you know I I may
[33:16] have done things and I may have done
[33:18] wrong but my I had some praying parents
[33:20] and I would not be in the place where
[33:22] I'm at if it wasn't for for their
[33:24] prayers obviously God through them amen
[33:27] amen
[33:28] I think a lot of us can say the same
[33:30] payment exact say it's the same thing as
[33:33] well next slide you have to remember
[33:37] your parents are always praying for you
[33:39] and if they're not shame unto them but I
[33:45] believe that they are I believe that
[33:48] your parents are praying for each and
[33:50] every one of you most importantly for
[33:52] your soul
[33:53] that's the most important thing so
[33:57] everything that we do or say exhibits
[34:00] respect or disrespect I just want to
[34:02] give go through just a few examples and
[34:04] just kind of say so quick about it look
[34:06] their respect was shown the Shunammite
[34:11] woman towards Elijah Elijah came to her
[34:14] and say hey give me to eat and she only
[34:17] had just a little bit of oil and a
[34:19] little bit of meal but to make a long
[34:23] story short she gave all that up because
[34:25] of the position and the respect and the
[34:27] honor for that prophet and you know what
[34:30] that cost it calls for her to never have
[34:33] that meal barrel to go empty and for
[34:36] that oil that cruse of oil to never go
[34:38] empty and not only that I believe was
[34:40] the same woman that caused a
[34:41] resurrection for her son who had died
[34:44] the prophet Elijah at the time respected
[34:48] her because he she respected him he had
[34:52] the word of the Lord and so now here's
[34:57] another here's here's a disrespect
[34:59] example in the Bible Marian and Aaron
[35:02] criticized Moses his wife he married a
[35:07] woman that was of another country but
[35:09] God was the one who put them together
[35:11] God was the one who put who caused that
[35:15] marriage to take place when there was
[35:18] and there was and so to Moses now watch
[35:21] this to Moses he it didn't seem like he
[35:24] cared I mean it doesn't seem like in the
[35:26] Bible that he cared
[35:27] Miriam and Aaron were criticizing his
[35:30] wife for what she was but it mattered a
[35:33] lot to God because it was a total
[35:36] disrespect to Moses and his position his
[35:39] office as a prophet because when you
[35:43] were talking about him or his wife you
[35:45] were talking about him
[35:46] you see that's how God saw it respect
[35:52] another another example respects the
[35:54] serf Phoenician woman in the crumbs of
[35:57] it that story is that woman had a
[36:03] daughter that when he was vexed with the
[36:05] devil she needed she was she had a demon
[36:07] genius that he she came to her ask him
[36:10] for Jesus to come and heal her he said
[36:12] no I'm not I'm not supposed to throw the
[36:15] bread to the dogs
[36:17] sounded like a disrespect but he knew
[36:21] what he was talking about because that
[36:23] was the only way to get her from saying
[36:26] yes but at least the dogs eat from the
[36:28] master from the crumbs of the master
[36:29] table if he wouldn't have said that she
[36:31] wouldn't have said that wonderful phrase
[36:33] that we all love and to cause her to
[36:36] receive the healing for her for her
[36:39] daughter and of course this respect Cain
[36:43] kills brought his brother Abel Abel was
[36:46] just serving God and was doing exactly
[36:49] what God revealed to him to offer a
[36:53] sacrifice of bloody sacrifice on the
[36:55] altar but because of jealousy and
[36:58] because of disrespect towards his
[37:01] brother
[37:02] we know Cain killed Abel so it was a
[37:05] disrespect and God took it as a
[37:08] disrespect because even his blood the
[37:10] Abel's blood was crying from the ground
[37:12] and even in that disrespectful act God
[37:17] still try to give Ken a chance and he's
[37:21] still disrespected God it was completely
[37:25] ousted yeah that's why I'm saying Saints
[37:29] and we're look at this in the moment the
[37:31] more you keep disrespecting the more you
[37:34] keep indulging in this respect and
[37:36] thinking that you're right and that
[37:38] you're in the in the disrespecting II
[37:41] everywhere you go everyw where do you go
[37:42] you will not get ahead in life I promise
[37:46] you that because it's all over the word
[37:49] and the word is our absolute you will
[37:52] not get ahead in life Matthew 7:12 says
[37:57] therefore all things whatsoever ye would
[38:00] that men should do to you
[38:02] this is Jesus's own words that you
[38:05] should do to you do ye even so to them
[38:09] for this is the law and the prophets you
[38:14] want somebody to treat you nice you come
[38:17] home from work husbands and you want
[38:21] your wife to - - to treat you kind to
[38:27] treat you nicely well how would you
[38:30] treat me here the night before see now I
[38:37] say husbands first because I'm a husband
[38:39] all right how are you treating your wife
[38:42] for you to come home and expect for her
[38:45] to have a cooked meal and to just come
[38:47] home and give you a hug and and just rub
[38:50] your hair and just oh honey I'm so glad
[38:53] that you know when you are disrespecting
[38:58] her all weekend long don't expect that
[39:03] all things whatsoever all things
[39:06] whatsoever you would that men should do
[39:08] to you do ye even so to them that's
[39:11] that's logical yes like brother Dale
[39:14] says that's sensible
[39:16] amen next slide we must fear the Lord
[39:21] respect others and love the Brotherhood
[39:23] proverbs 9:10 says the fear of the Lord
[39:25] is the beginning of wisdom now this fear
[39:28] a man is not I'm afraid of God because
[39:31] he's gonna strike me with a lightning
[39:33] bolt no it's a respect and a reverence
[39:36] towards God and towards his word and
[39:38] towards his people cuz remember what
[39:42] brother Brown said when you disrespect
[39:44] his people you disrespect God that's not
[39:47] a fear of the Lord the fear of the Lord
[39:49] is the beginning of wisdom you want
[39:52] wisdom in your life start fearing God
[39:55] start respecting his word start
[39:57] respecting his people start respecting
[39:59] his ways if you want to get ahead in
[40:02] life
[40:02] and the knowledge of the Holy One is
[40:05] understanding first peter 2:17 we were
[40:07] cocky putting this because honor all man
[40:09] and I love the Brotherhood fear God
[40:12] honor the king Ephesians 5:20 21 says
[40:15] given thanks always for all things unto
[40:17] God and the father in the name of our
[40:19] Lord Jesus Christ submitting yourselves
[40:21] one to another in the fear of God
[40:25] I can't submit to her she just gets on
[40:32] my nerves every time I'm around her
[40:36] submit submit be humble amongst one
[40:41] another be meek amongst each other
[40:43] remember if for no other reason it's
[40:47] because she was created in the image of
[40:50] God
[40:51] all right respect honor all man next
[40:57] slide what kind of power comes with
[41:00] respect let's just look at these things
[41:02] here for just a moment respect is a gift
[41:04] to another and it is not earned
[41:07] sometimes people say say there they get
[41:11] they got to earn my respect no they
[41:13] don't
[41:14] you you show respect either way I don't
[41:18] care a brother weight is completely
[41:19] disrespecting me but I still show him a
[41:23] respect because not respecting what he's
[41:27] doing to me but I'm respecting him as a
[41:30] human being there's a sense of respect
[41:33] there but also as a brother in Christ
[41:37] there's got to be a respect there as
[41:39] well you see it doesn't matter what
[41:42] anybody has done to you there's got to
[41:45] be a level of respect I may not agree
[41:46] with them and you don't have to agree
[41:50] with her but you must show that a level
[41:52] of respect for who they are
[41:54] respect is an investment it will get you
[41:58] good interest terrible interest or no
[41:59] interest if you give show respect amen
[42:05] there will be something come out of that
[42:07] I have never seen anybody that shown
[42:10] respect that nothing good has come out
[42:12] of it in my whole life in my life myself
[42:15] growing up going through college and
[42:18] getting married and all these things
[42:20] every moment that I've shown respect it
[42:22] always comes back to me and I believe
[42:26] that you can say the same thing
[42:28] but what doesn't come back to you is
[42:30] when you show disrespect as a matter of
[42:32] fact that actually hurts you it actually
[42:35] hurts you more respect is a seed that
[42:38] ultimately creates a good harvest and
[42:41] that's kind of like respect as an
[42:43] investment respect is a weapon it's an
[42:47] easy weapon that you and I can easily
[42:49] use to get to get what we need out of
[42:54] life right it can get you a job it can
[42:58] get your position it can get you favored
[43:01] for from the people in furtherance in
[43:04] the word Amen when I first started
[43:08] coming here to the church I did not
[43:09] understand everything that was being
[43:11] preached and I had been coming here
[43:14] since 2003 and and and you know I was
[43:18] serving the Lord but every time I'd come
[43:19] here I'd sit back there in the back kind
[43:21] of like when my wife's sitting and I
[43:23] just fall asleep like just like some of
[43:26] you do and I'm not saying that I don't
[43:29] fight it I still fight it but I'd be
[43:32] back now I'm talking about completely
[43:34] dozing dude I mean how many mother I
[43:37] just didn't understand what brother Dale
[43:39] was saying I just didn't understand it
[43:42] when we started coming here in 2014 and
[43:46] I said and this was my sincere prayer I
[43:49] said Lord helped me to understand your
[43:52] word not for my sake but for the sake of
[43:55] my family that I may be a better father
[43:58] that I may be a better husband and they
[44:01] might I understand your ways and God
[44:04] granted that for me amen amen
[44:08] why God saw the level of respect that
[44:12] was in my heart
[44:13] God knows each and every one of your
[44:14] hearts amen
[44:19] respect is a fortress it's solid you can
[44:22] never you can never show too much
[44:23] respect you can never show too much
[44:26] honor and respect to anyone and respect
[44:29] creates a positive environment amen
[44:33] whether it's in your home Church
[44:35] workplace it could create a revival in
[44:38] you it always creates a positive
[44:41] environment now I don't know if you
[44:43] could say see this or not but watch what
[44:46] you respect will come toward you and
[44:50] what you don't respect will move away
[44:53] from you I want to say that again
[44:57] because that's very important what you
[44:59] respect will come toward you and what
[45:03] you don't respect will move away from
[45:05] you I I see this I see this and I'll
[45:14] talk about this here in just a moment
[45:15] but you see this amongst amongst
[45:18] children and parents when there's a
[45:20] level of disrespect right there between
[45:22] the children and the parents both coming
[45:26] from the parent to the child or the
[45:29] child to the parent you watch and see if
[45:31] that that if that child will not start
[45:34] hating hating you or even even loathing
[45:40] you being around you I've seen it in the
[45:43] past why because every time they come
[45:46] around you it's like alarm is coming to
[45:48] them there's alarms you know sounding
[45:51] whenever you're around you because
[45:53] you've shown a level of disrespect to
[45:56] them they have just as much opinion in
[45:59] their Mareike to their opinion as you
[46:03] and as the parent does I have to allow
[46:06] my daughter to to speak especially now
[46:10] as she's in her teenage years because
[46:13] right now to them that they're growing
[46:16] and it's like a scaffold that that's you
[46:21] know it looks messy you see I understand
[46:24] you and I have been there and done day
[46:26] it doesn't look good it doesn't mean we
[46:27] don't we we don't see the end result
[46:30] whereas they're going through
[46:31] teenage years but believe me they mut
[46:34] their that God is doing something in
[46:36] them they must go through those times
[46:39] they must go through those times so all
[46:42] we have to do Saints is just for those
[46:45] of us who have teenage children or those
[46:47] about to have teenage children the best
[46:49] thing that you can do you can't you
[46:51] can't tell them to to stop doing a
[46:53] certain thing that as a teenager it's
[46:55] normal for them to do we get we get I
[46:58] wouldn't you know when and when Bella
[47:01] started questioning things you know
[47:03] regarding whenever I would talk to her
[47:05] now she's questioning not questioning
[47:07] the word or nothing like that but now
[47:09] she she could she challenges me now
[47:11] we're in the passage that she hasn't but
[47:15] that's a normal reaction from a teenager
[47:18] that that helps them to up to to cope
[47:21] with people later on in life with you
[47:25] know challenges and stuff like that
[47:26] that's a normal reaction and the best
[47:27] thing that you can do is just channel
[47:30] that in a different way not go against
[47:34] it but just channel it and you will keep
[47:38] the favour of your child
[47:41] so what you what your respect will come
[47:44] towards you and I've seen this in my
[47:47] life Saints the more that I respect my
[47:49] children the more that they will come to
[47:51] me the more I disrespect them the less
[47:55] that they don't want to be around me and
[47:59] those that are planning on getting
[48:01] married remember these things as well
[48:05] next slide so are there consequences
[48:09] that come from this respect this respect
[48:11] is also a seed it will produce a bad
[48:13] harvest or no harvest I put the little
[48:17] kitty there no - is he being respectful
[48:21] disrespectful
[48:23] I don't know maybe he has something and
[48:28] some food in his mouth that he doesn't
[48:29] like kind of put that in there cuz I
[48:36] know things are kind of tense right now
[48:37] and get you get you to laugh a little
[48:39] bit this respect conveys this interest
[48:42] towards others it means that you are no
[48:45] value to me when you're around them this
[48:48] respect leads to loss of relationships
[48:51] separation divorce hatred towards each
[48:54] other the majority of the divorces I
[48:57] believe that taking place and when they
[48:59] continue to take place is because they
[49:02] don't respect one another husbands and
[49:04] wife don't respect one another this
[49:06] respect is not the nature of God there
[49:09] is no place for it in a believers life
[49:12] this respect never gets you ahead in
[49:15] life
[49:16] well no give you a no job no favor from
[49:19] others and no furtherance with God this
[49:22] respect can become a habit it can become
[49:25] a difficult habit to cut loose from
[49:27] again the more we do it the more that we
[49:31] think that we're not doing wrong I come
[49:34] over here and I start making fun of each
[49:35] and every one of you of the defects and
[49:38] things like that and calling you out in
[49:40] the middle of the congregation and
[49:41] things like that that's a disrespect no
[49:45] matter what kind of defect you might
[49:47] have that's a disrespect to the brother
[49:49] to the sister and to God you must not do
[49:53] that because you quench the Holy Spirit
[49:56] trying to work when you come up here
[49:58] joking and stuff like that and calling
[50:02] each other things and stuff like that
[50:04] that you're not supposed to again what
[50:09] you respect will come toward you what
[50:11] you don't respect will move away from
[50:13] you next next slide alright how can you
[50:19] start applying respect and Submission in
[50:21] your own life let's look at self-respect
[50:23] real quick first Corinthians chapter 6
[50:24] verses 19 know ye not your body is the
[50:27] temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you
[50:29] which ye have of God and you are not
[50:31] your own for ye are bought with a price
[50:35] therefore glorify
[50:36] God in your body and in your spirit
[50:39] which are gods that's why when Satan
[50:42] comes around and then this happens a lot
[50:45] to younger people saying comes around
[50:47] says I'm just not pretty I look at my
[50:49] hair I got pimples all over my face and
[50:51] I can't get I can't do and and you know
[50:54] what the spirit of depression starts
[50:56] coming on even young Peter belacan Bella
[51:00] can tell you she goes to public school
[51:02] she's she's got friends with full-blown
[51:05] depression on their life and I tell her
[51:08] I tell her it's a spirit they come to
[51:12] her you know to try to get counsel from
[51:14] her and stuff like that I said but you'd
[51:15] be careful that thing will come on you
[51:18] it's hard to get rid of that but the
[51:21] Ryan you you you you know and sister
[51:24] Gabby you you know therefore glorified
[51:27] got it so so you as a person you have to
[51:31] think I'm made in the image of God and
[51:33] it doesn't matter right now I may look
[51:36] this way but I'm still made in the image
[51:38] of God I may have this certain defect
[51:40] but I'm still made in the image of God
[51:42] God created me for his purpose and if I
[51:48] filled with the Holy Ghost amen
[51:50] you're you're more beautiful than
[51:52] anybody else here on this on this art on
[51:54] the earth seven over seven billion
[51:56] people here on this earth amen you're
[51:58] one of the most beautiful amen
[52:01] visions 2:10 for we are his workmanship
[52:04] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[52:07] which God hath before ordained that we
[52:10] should walk in them hey man there's no
[52:12] sense in a Christian there's no need for
[52:15] a Christian amen to have to accept the
[52:18] devil's lies about what they look like
[52:20] and things like that amen there's things
[52:24] that we can do to try to help mediate
[52:26] that that's your choice but you're still
[52:29] made in the image of God and then next
[52:32] slide how can you start applying respect
[52:36] and submission in the home life let's
[52:38] look at vision look what Paul says here
[52:40] Ephesians 6:1 through four children obey
[52:43] your parents in the Lord for this is
[52:45] right that's just the right thing
[52:49] Oh your parents love that get him
[52:53] brother Luiz get him yeah
[52:59] honor thy father and mother right which
[53:03] is the first commandment with promise we
[53:06] already looked at this honor thy father
[53:07] and mother that it may be well with the
[53:10] endowments live long on the earth that's
[53:12] not the only verse that talks about this
[53:14] there's many other verses in the Bible
[53:15] in Proverbs Psalms that talks about long
[53:18] life when you fear God when you do when
[53:21] you fear his word when you fear God's
[53:23] word you will see this in the word and
[53:25] you will say oh my I want to obey that
[53:26] and as you obey your parents I've told
[53:29] my daughter's this as you obey us you're
[53:31] obeying God you're obeying God but watch
[53:36] what verse 4 says and ye father's that
[53:39] word father's it means both husbands and
[53:42] wives babies most mothers and and
[53:44] fathers and he father's provoke not your
[53:48] children to wrath provoking them causing
[53:53] them to stir an anger in them that if
[53:58] they disagree with you or they can't you
[54:01] or they every time they want to have a
[54:03] serious conversation with you just joke
[54:05] about it that's not right that's
[54:10] absolutely not right and therefore
[54:12] that's why some were young people they
[54:14] just rebel and they and to them they
[54:18] think that everybody else is against
[54:19] them everybody is against them why
[54:21] because you've shown us a disrespect to
[54:23] you to your own children and you
[54:27] father's provoke not your children to
[54:30] wrath but bring them up in the nurture
[54:32] and the admonition of the Lord
[54:34] I want to sit down with my children and
[54:37] have a conversation with them I don't
[54:39] want to just dialogue with them and then
[54:41] just talk to them and they don't say
[54:43] nothing back to me because they don't
[54:45] say nothing back to you because they're
[54:47] accepting what you're saying but down
[54:48] deep in their heart that they're hiding
[54:50] that and you're saving it for later on
[54:54] and one day you will you will regret
[54:56] their as exactly what they're doing
[55:00] you dialogue with your children you talk
[55:03] back to them and then and and said this
[55:06] respect when you when you constantly
[55:08] just keep the word you're constantly
[55:11] there do you like to be around somebody
[55:13] they're just always in your face and
[55:15] just constantly talking and never let
[55:17] you talk how many love that none of us
[55:20] like that well what do you think your
[55:24] young people your children that's the
[55:28] exact same thing dialogue with them and
[55:32] in that in that dialogue I meant with
[55:34] with seasoning seasoned words and things
[55:37] you know and and it's a friendship
[55:39] that's how you got to treat your you and
[55:41] your children as friends as friends this
[55:47] respect will lead to bitterness and
[55:49] resentment amongst the family next one
[55:52] next slide
[55:53] Oh Oh respect between husband and wife
[56:02] Ephesians 5:22 33 wives submit
[56:06] yourselves unto your own husband's as
[56:07] unto the Lord submit I may not agree but
[56:17] I'm gonna submit why because of mission
[56:19] is power amen
[56:23] I don't see his point but I wanted so
[56:27] I'm gonna submit for the sake of the
[56:29] Lord for the Lord's sake right for the
[56:32] husband is the head of the wife even as
[56:35] Christ is the head of the church and he
[56:37] is the savior of the body therefore as
[56:40] the church is subject unto Christ see we
[56:43] like that we we like that we're subject
[56:45] to Christ you know we are certainly
[56:47] subject to Christ so let the wives be to
[56:50] their own husbands and everything in
[56:55] everything I didn't say God said that do
[57:00] you believe Paul had the Holy Ghost
[57:02] then it was God through the Paul saying
[57:05] it and everything even if it does if you
[57:10] don't agree with it now obviously in
[57:12] brother branham brought
[57:14] question-and-answers if he's leading you
[57:16] to worship other gods or not coming to
[57:19] church or or things like that that's a
[57:21] different story but in things of life
[57:25] amen you should submit to everything now
[57:28] what husbands love your wives alright
[57:34] husbands love your wives why does it say
[57:36] love because that's what women need
[57:40] that's what our sisters need they need
[57:43] love they need to know husbands they
[57:46] need to know that you are there for them
[57:48] the immediate reaction that we have as
[57:51] husbands when something goes wrong and
[57:53] they come to us complaining sweetheart I
[57:55] just you don't know the kind of day that
[57:57] I had today these children they just all
[57:59] over the place and I can't take it
[58:01] anymore and I can't what's the first
[58:03] thing we want to do well well this is
[58:06] what you need to do why don't you do
[58:07] more of this why don't you do that then
[58:09] the other our first instinct is to try
[58:11] to fix things because that's the
[58:14] instinct of a man we want to fix things
[58:17] well that's not that's not me and you
[58:20] know I if I don't fix it I'll make it
[58:22] worse but but that's why is that so
[58:32] funny
[58:34] I hope it's helping somebody hope it's
[58:40] helping a couple because yeah Saints
[58:45] it's the truth you got to love your wife
[58:48] your your wife is not there wanting to
[58:52] get rid of fix everything all she wants
[58:56] is that you're out there listening to
[58:58] her and say honey I'm here for you I
[59:02] love you
[59:03] I love you yeah I love you that's all
[59:12] she needs and with that you've done much
[59:15] more than sitting there trying to give a
[59:16] checklist of what you got to do this is
[59:19] what you got to do do this that day and
[59:21] then this and this will happen that's
[59:23] not gonna work it never has hasn't
[59:26] worked for me if it works for you great
[59:29] but it doesn't work for me you just be
[59:32] right there for your wife listening to
[59:34] her and that's loving her husbands love
[59:38] your wives even as Christ also loved the
[59:40] church and gave himself for it
[59:42] nevertheless let every one of you in
[59:44] particular so love his wife even as
[59:48] himself the way you take care of
[59:51] yourselves husbands the way you would
[59:53] not go out you know and then you make
[59:55] sure that you got your deodorant on and
[59:57] you're that you're showered and and you
[59:59] take care of your of your body that's
[1:00:02] how you gotta take care of your wife do
[1:00:04] not leave her you know there's so much
[1:00:06] disrespect among husbands and wives one
[1:00:09] want one of them is over there the other
[1:00:11] one's over here and and I see it you go
[1:00:13] to restaurants and what nowadays this is
[1:00:17] what you see you watch them one of them
[1:00:19] is on their phone across from them the
[1:00:22] other ones on their phone
[1:00:23] and they're supposed to be having a date
[1:00:27] that is a disrespect to each other
[1:00:31] that's that's a total disrespect and in
[1:00:33] society is leading you to do that and
[1:00:37] you're allowing them to do it God
[1:00:39] created us to fellowship with one
[1:00:41] another I didn't get married to my wife
[1:00:44] to be on my phone constantly I got
[1:00:46] married to my wife they when I'm around
[1:00:48] her I want a fellowship with her and she
[1:00:51] wants to do the same with me amen
[1:00:54] praise God so love his wife even as
[1:00:58] himself and the wife see that she
[1:01:00] reverence her husband see it doesn't say
[1:01:04] that that that the wife loved a husband
[1:01:07] cuz we really don't need that we know
[1:01:10] that you love us I know that you love me
[1:01:13] sweetheart I don't really need to for
[1:01:16] you to tell me
[1:01:17] I need to tell you because that's what
[1:01:19] women need but look how Paul says that
[1:01:22] see that the wife revans her husband you
[1:01:25] know what reverence is is respect it's
[1:01:28] respect all what what a man wants is
[1:01:31] respect you respect your husband you may
[1:01:35] not agree with him and everything but
[1:01:37] you respect him for the position that he
[1:01:39] holds on my we're going let's go
[1:01:41] next slide I respect in the church life
[1:01:43] Philippians 2 2 to 4 fulfilled me my joy
[1:01:47] that you be like-minded having the same
[1:01:48] love being of one Accord of one mind
[1:01:51] being a one Accord in one mind let
[1:01:53] nothing be done through strife or
[1:01:54] vainglory but in lowliness of mind in
[1:01:58] other words humility let each esteem
[1:02:01] other better than themselves
[1:02:05] you should I should see brother Wade
[1:02:08] esteem him better than my needs when
[1:02:12] he's around me
[1:02:13] I'm here to serve Him where the Dawn's
[1:02:16] around me I'm here to serve as a matter
[1:02:18] of fact that's what a minister is is one
[1:02:20] that serves it's not one that kicks you
[1:02:23] in in submission and doesn't know it's
[1:02:26] one that serves I'm here to serve each
[1:02:28] and every one of you alright that's what
[1:02:31] a minister is but alone ease of mind let
[1:02:35] each esteem other better and so look not
[1:02:37] every man on his own things but every
[1:02:40] man also on the things of others this is
[1:02:44] a direct commandment from God
[1:02:46] 1st Thessalonians 5 12 to 13 and we
[1:02:48] beseech you brethren to know them which
[1:02:50] labor among you in other words to
[1:02:54] recognize them that labor among you and
[1:02:57] are over you in the Lord and admonish
[1:03:01] you and to esteem them very highly in
[1:03:05] love for their work safely
[1:03:09] that's a respect that's a respect but
[1:03:14] the weight may preach something I may
[1:03:16] disagree with it right
[1:03:18] may because God hasn't revealed that to
[1:03:20] me I don't know but that doesn't mean I
[1:03:23] go disrespecting or sit there at the
[1:03:25] bench just looking at him
[1:03:27] you just wait until I preach no that's a
[1:03:33] total disrespect it's disrespectful and
[1:03:38] it's disrespectful to God and be at
[1:03:41] peace among yourselves the the whole
[1:03:45] thing is to be at peace amongst each
[1:03:47] other you know
[1:03:50] doesn't matter what we've done to one
[1:03:52] another the past is the past we're
[1:03:56] seeking peace amen
[1:04:00] we're seeking peace next slide Hebrews
[1:04:03] 13:7 I remember them which have the rule
[1:04:06] over you you have spoken unto you the
[1:04:08] Word of God and we know Jesus Christ the
[1:04:10] same yesterday today and forever
[1:04:11] remember them respect them
[1:04:14] Ephesians 5 1 through 4 be therefore
[1:04:16] followers of God as dear children let's
[1:04:17] just go down to verse 3 but fornication
[1:04:20] and all uncleanness or covetousness let
[1:04:22] it not be once named among you as become
[1:04:25] Saints neither filthiness nor foolish
[1:04:28] talking nor jesting I do say that the
[1:04:33] word says that joking around in the
[1:04:37] church and cutting up and and and and
[1:04:42] making light of one another that's not
[1:04:45] right that's a disrespect and God will
[1:04:49] deal with it
[1:04:53] jesting which are not convenient Paul
[1:04:56] says but rather giving of thanks it just
[1:05:01] makes you look bad when you send they're
[1:05:03] making fun of everybody you know when
[1:05:05] you send they're joking joking the Aerie
[1:05:07] everything that comes out of your mouth
[1:05:08] is a joke about somebody you know what
[1:05:11] that makes you look cheap and you know
[1:05:14] what people are gonna disrespect you the
[1:05:15] same way so it's not convenient and it
[1:05:21] doesn't help anybody because behind the
[1:05:23] every joke there's a truth but in other
[1:05:28] words behind every little thing that you
[1:05:31] might say you might say to brother ray
[1:05:33] you know or something like that about
[1:05:34] his heighth or something like that
[1:05:36] behind it there's a truth
[1:05:39] there's the truth of what's in your
[1:05:41] heart or what you think or what am I say
[1:05:44] about brother Marcos AK or whoever
[1:05:46] there's a truth behind that and it's a
[1:05:48] disrespect to God nextslide respecting
[1:05:55] the church life sometimes you can be
[1:05:57] disrespectful and not know that you are
[1:05:59] being disrespectful and you can think
[1:06:01] I'm just being honest with you because
[1:06:04] we think we are being dishonest if we
[1:06:07] don't express our true feelings let me
[1:06:12] just be honest with you when somebody
[1:06:14] says that to me Who am I and get away
[1:06:17] what in the world's got to come out of
[1:06:20] their mouth you know we got we don't
[1:06:26] always have to be right about everything
[1:06:30] we don't always have to be right there's
[1:06:33] some times that it's okay for somebody
[1:06:36] to be right and you're wrong it's fine
[1:06:40] that's good you there's times that that
[1:06:43] needs to happen you don't always need to
[1:06:45] be right about everything and just
[1:06:47] because it's the truth doesn't
[1:06:50] necessarily mean that it's always the
[1:06:52] right thing to go to the person and tell
[1:06:54] them that sometimes it's better just to
[1:06:57] let God deal with it
[1:06:58] let pray about it and let God do the
[1:07:02] work familiarity begins to lessen
[1:07:08] respect when we are around each other
[1:07:11] all the time we become less respectful
[1:07:15] that's the truth every time if we if
[1:07:18] we're constantly around each other that
[1:07:20] increases the chance of disrespecting
[1:07:23] one another and you see this amongst
[1:07:25] family you see this amongst amongst
[1:07:27] people constantly there's a constant
[1:07:30] disrespect why because they're always
[1:07:31] with each other it's good to be with
[1:07:34] each other but you need to practice it
[1:07:36] respecting one another now I'm not
[1:07:38] saying you can't joke around and stuff
[1:07:40] like that but when it's something that's
[1:07:42] off-color and something that it's not
[1:07:44] right that's a disrespect I mean I'm
[1:07:47] gonna be the first one to tell you I
[1:07:49] love joking around I love messing around
[1:07:52] love laughing
[1:07:53] because that's my makeup somebody called
[1:07:56] me one time and I believe his sister
[1:07:57] truly this smiling prophet I don't know
[1:08:00] somebody said that but you know I didn't
[1:08:03] like the Prophet part but but or no it
[1:08:06] was somebody that used to come to church
[1:08:07] here
[1:08:08] sorry sister Trudy sorry I guess because
[1:08:11] I'm smiling a lot well praise God praise
[1:08:15] God you know I like to laugh I like to
[1:08:18] smile making light of one another in
[1:08:21] derogatory ways is disrespectful and it
[1:08:23] quenches the moving of the Spirit is
[1:08:26] that the truth or not I don't think I'm
[1:08:28] saying anything that's wrong that's I
[1:08:31] believe that's what God wants next all
[1:08:35] right the brother Brown says this the
[1:08:38] only way that you can respect God is to
[1:08:39] respect one another is that right if you
[1:08:41] want somebody to say something good
[1:08:43] about you you say something good about
[1:08:44] somebody else they'll say something good
[1:08:47] about you and you do unto others as you
[1:08:50] have done them do unto you nextslide
[1:08:53] going quickly now alright fearing God is
[1:08:57] respecting God we talked about this
[1:08:59] already a little bit but praise ye the
[1:09:00] Lord these are some verses in the Bible
[1:09:02] that talk about fear which fears
[1:09:04] respecting the Lord praise ye the Lord
[1:09:06] blessed his demand that fear or respect
[1:09:09] to the Lord that delighteth greatly and
[1:09:12] His commandments
[1:09:13] he's a blessed man proverbs 1027 the
[1:09:15] fear of the Lord prolong its days in
[1:09:18] other words it makes your life longer
[1:09:20] but the years of the wicked shall be
[1:09:22] shortened proverbs 22 for by humility
[1:09:27] and the fear of the Lord are riches and
[1:09:30] honor in life nobody uh very few in life
[1:09:36] that have gotten to positions where they
[1:09:39] are by disrespecting everybody I kind of
[1:09:42] highly doubt that they is because
[1:09:46] respect respect goes a long way and it's
[1:09:49] very powerful since proverbs 28 14 happy
[1:09:52] is the man that feareth alway but he
[1:09:55] that hardeneth his heart shall fall into
[1:09:58] mischief
[1:10:00] amen next slide
[1:10:03] fearing God is respecting God
[1:10:05] Deuteronomy 624 says and the LORD
[1:10:08] commanded us to do all these statutes to
[1:10:11] fear the Lord our God for our for our
[1:10:13] good always that's why God has our good
[1:10:17] in mind no not our not not not because
[1:10:20] you fear God you're gonna you're gonna
[1:10:22] have you're gonna be something Bad's
[1:10:24] gonna happen to you know the Bible says
[1:10:26] that something good always happens see
[1:10:28] whenever you respect God whenever you
[1:10:31] fear the Lord that he might preserve us
[1:10:33] alive as it is at this day so I'm 34 9
[1:10:36] Oh fear the Lord ye his Saints for there
[1:10:38] is no one to them that fear him next
[1:10:41] slide brother Branham says that we're
[1:10:42] almost done and today that's the thing
[1:10:45] today when we see people and people are
[1:10:46] so subject in this day to jump in a
[1:10:49] little flower everything till it makes
[1:10:51] you kind of wonder sometimes don't never
[1:10:53] think above one man above another
[1:10:56] this goes for parents this goes for
[1:10:59] husbands and wives this goes for the
[1:11:01] church body don't never think about one
[1:11:03] man or another no sir no matter who he
[1:11:05] is if he's just a little fellow out here
[1:11:09] giving tracts out on the street and if
[1:11:11] he's a Billy Graham no matter who he is
[1:11:13] if he's God's servant respect them all
[1:11:16] the same everyone don't have one above
[1:11:19] another and favorites
[1:11:22] there's no favorites in God weird all
[1:11:25] his servants maybe you have preferences
[1:11:28] maybe you have you you enjoy maybe this
[1:11:31] style more than this style but no I'm
[1:11:34] not gonna listen to him because I like
[1:11:36] this person more this preacher know if
[1:11:39] it's the Word of God it's the Word of
[1:11:41] God we don't have that brother Branham
[1:11:44] says don't do that and don't respect one
[1:11:46] person above another let everybody be on
[1:11:49] the level I believe that's sensible next
[1:11:53] slide now one of the best sides of
[1:11:59] submission is when Isaac submitted to
[1:12:03] Abraham I mean here's a young man I'm
[1:12:07] almost done Saints but here's a little
[1:12:09] ya a young man in his teenage years I
[1:12:11] don't know exactly how old he was but he
[1:12:13] seemed like he was past 13 years old and
[1:12:16] did not it's
[1:12:17] that carries him up to the top of
[1:12:18] mountain tells him to carry the wood
[1:12:21] he's just obeying doing what he was
[1:12:23] supposed to do and then all of a sudden
[1:12:25] his father says all right son I'm mad
[1:12:28] you know and starting starts tying him
[1:12:31] down starts doing this and you know what
[1:12:34] he just sit there and he probably hasn't
[1:12:36] looked dad what's happening what's going
[1:12:39] on what what did I do
[1:12:41] it's the Sun and maybe Abraham couldn't
[1:12:44] just say anything to him about it he was
[1:12:46] he was just expecting for God to do
[1:12:49] something because he knew that God had
[1:12:51] promised him that son and all Isaac did
[1:12:55] was just submit to his dad's prayer now
[1:12:57] young people your dads are not that bad
[1:13:03] now it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't that
[1:13:06] Abraham was told to do that but your
[1:13:09] dad's never done that neither has your
[1:13:11] mom for you for her to deserve the
[1:13:14] disrespect that you give her from day to
[1:13:16] day or him from day to day
[1:13:20] you're always fed you're always
[1:13:22] nourished you're always have things that
[1:13:25] you that you need and respect them
[1:13:28] respect is what needs to go there what a
[1:13:33] wonderful story and you know what
[1:13:34] because God because Abraham respected
[1:13:37] God's command to him and Isaac respected
[1:13:41] who was a type of Christ
[1:13:43] Isaac respected his father God came on
[1:13:47] the scene you see what respect does
[1:13:50] whatwhat submission does it never can
[1:13:54] never go wrong next next one and this
[1:13:57] one I'm gonna in one of my favorite
[1:13:59] stories is the respect that David had
[1:14:01] towards Saul
[1:14:03] even though Saul was trying to kill him
[1:14:06] even though Saul was following him twice
[1:14:10] in the word and you can read this in
[1:14:11] first samuel over this first samuel
[1:14:13] chapter 24 and then again in chapter 26
[1:14:16] i believe they saw was looking for for
[1:14:22] david up in the mountains and in a cave
[1:14:25] and david god david could
[1:14:29] have killed saw in both instances and we
[1:14:34] don't have time to read it but you go
[1:14:35] home and read it and you see the
[1:14:38] attitude that David took towards saw
[1:14:40] knowing that that was his enemy and even
[1:14:43] even David's era of friends was telling
[1:14:47] him God has delivered he saw to you this
[1:14:50] is your chance take it take it God has
[1:14:54] done it and David would not put his hand
[1:14:56] on saw his enemy why because Indian
[1:15:01] David says there's many times he says I
[1:15:03] I will not hurt the Lord's anointed he
[1:15:08] was respectful to the anointing he was
[1:15:12] respectful to the anointing amen twice
[1:15:16] the first time he was he cut off Saul's
[1:15:19] saws ham of His garment and showed it to
[1:15:22] him I said look God could have delivered
[1:15:24] delivered me to you but I refused it I
[1:15:27] refused to kill you then two chapters
[1:15:31] later saw again in his crazy ways goes
[1:15:35] and tries to find David again and and
[1:15:39] David he and one of his friends pulls
[1:15:42] out Saul's javelin out or his spear
[1:15:47] takes it away from him and then later
[1:15:49] when he reveals to him that he's there
[1:15:51] it shows him hey look I look I was right
[1:15:53] there right next to you close to you
[1:15:55] took your halt your javelin and could
[1:15:58] have could have killed you and did it
[1:16:00] what are you for chasing me and in one
[1:16:03] of those instances he bowed he actually
[1:16:05] bows down before it's all respect and
[1:16:09] Saul could have probably killed him
[1:16:13] right there but he wouldn't do it
[1:16:15] because of that respect that was there
[1:16:18] that David was coming out of David for a
[1:16:22] man that was trying to kill him
[1:16:26] amen so I think that's it so Saints I
[1:16:32] hope that you see respect and submission
[1:16:35] in a different light
[1:16:36] oh this is help you can never show too
[1:16:46] much respect to anybody and it's and
[1:16:50] nothing and something good would not
[1:16:52] come out of it
[1:16:53] but every time that you're disrespectful
[1:16:56] especially to eat one another I
[1:16:58] challenge you Saints let's let's if
[1:17:01] you're doing it if you're in the habit
[1:17:03] of doing it it's time to cut it down
[1:17:05] Thanks we're not gonna have next thing
[1:17:08] is a resurrection I want to see a
[1:17:12] resurrection
[1:17:14] this respect whatever is hindering your
[1:17:17] life needs to start getting away from
[1:17:19] you this you needs to start cutting
[1:17:21] those things out of your life because we
[1:17:24] know that the word is true we know that
[1:17:26] that's the next thing that's taking
[1:17:28] place and if it wasn't important to talk
[1:17:30] about this respect and in respect they
[1:17:33] wouldn't be in the word this is
[1:17:35] important just as much as any other
[1:17:37] doctrine is just as much as any other
[1:17:39] things that you can know all mysteries
[1:17:41] Paul said and not have love not have
[1:17:44] respect for one another and used to
[1:17:46] sound and brass and a tinkling cymbal
[1:17:50] let's start practicing this are
[1:17:52] challenging the rest of the year
[1:17:54] challenging and make it a habit you've
[1:17:56] made it a habit of disrespect now let's
[1:17:58] make it a habit of respect and then you
[1:18:03] pray for me because that's my desire and
[1:18:05] I'll pray for you God bless you all
[1:18:08] let's stand to our feet
[1:18:18] and what do we have brother boy amen I
[1:18:25] surrender all let's just sing that unto
[1:18:28] Him this you know Saints there's many
[1:18:32] other examples even brother Branham gave
[1:18:34] in his life he had many examples of
[1:18:36] respect disrespect and things like that
[1:18:39] many things that we could talk about
[1:18:40] just so many things but let's just
[1:18:44] surrender all to him and and then maybe
[1:18:48] maybe in your own prayer time at home
[1:18:50] and say Lord let me surrender to you
[1:18:54] because the more I surrender to you the
[1:18:56] more it will be easier for me to to show
[1:18:59] respect to others to show you respect I
[1:19:02] will be able to show respect unto others
[1:19:04] and in turn you will receive respect
[1:19:07] amen
