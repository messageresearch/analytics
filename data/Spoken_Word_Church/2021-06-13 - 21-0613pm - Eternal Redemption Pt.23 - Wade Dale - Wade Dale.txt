going to be a re-sermon of this morning so pretty much some of the scriptures and also one quote for sure so but that's okay it's okay we'll just take it uh it's part of eternal redemption like i said sunday or wednesday night this whole thing hinges on resurrection right that's right there had to be one and there's got to be another there's got to be a resurrection there's got to be a resurrection you've got to have a resurrection spiritually and then we're going to have a physical resurrection so everything's tied with death burial and resurrection you say oh now brother wait you read the quote i said i did but you've got to be dead in christ here right when we bury you in baptism you're dead to christ i mean you're dead in christ here dead to the world right all right so hebrews 9 11 let's bow our heads dear lord thank you for this day thank you for the word that you give us now i pray that you would just come among us in a special way lord teach your people father you be the one that does the speaking you be the one that reveals the message lord today to the people for any sick lord you pray that you just heal them today father as we speak the the word lord that as it goes forth that it has healing power to it lord it has a temporary resurrection lord i pray that you just touch each one that's driving and and coming from different places lord i pray that you'd be with us this coming week on our father's day trip be with the sisters as they travel lord to tennessee lord and have a time lord fellowship there lord we pray that you'd be with them father just forgive us of our sins our many mistakes that we make against you lord just keep us strong bless the pastor lord keep that thing out of his throat and bless him lord and everybody praying for him lord that that thing's got to go away in the name of the lord jesus christ we ask these things amen make that devil uncomfortable amen that joker would be uncomfortable i want to be comfortable coming in here amen hebrews 9 11 but christ being coming high priest of good things to come by greater more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us now we're going to cover one more uh scripture before we be seated revelations 10 verse 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery one mystery amen now there's a lot of mysteries but there's only one mystery that's going to take us out of here the mystery of god should be what finished not started finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets you may be seated in the lord at his blessing to the reading of the word so let's go to isaiah 7 14 because as brother dale was talking this morning keep in the back of your mind who was the son of man now remember the son of man is indicated by bible indicated by any commentary you know that and brother branham covered it completely that the son of man was when god resided in human flesh all right the son of god or jehovah god was back in the old testament he would come into human flesh and then he would leave melchizedek captain of the host all the different things people would meet god in human flesh but it was temporary that wasn't our savior at the moment that was jehovah god that was god above the people god couldn't get in the people until he came himself and then when he came himself as a baby the son of man was born on the earth everybody got that same amen and the son of god was residing inside that son of man not two people same person not two people not two personalities the same person but it was god in morphine now into a uh um uh i guess you would say a what would you say he he morphed into a spot that he could be the redeemer he morphed into a place or or something he had to come to to be the redeemer of the world now look see though adam was the son of god though you and i are sons and daughters of god we've never reached that position as being the son of man there was only one and the reason i said that is because what brother dale said this morning a lot of people thought brother brown was the son of man he was listen the son of man was born with no sex the son of man was born of from a virgin he did not have a carnal mind he was not all messed up like me and you are brother branham included right you say messed up yeah he was a human right we all come here messed up that's right believe me but jesus did not so the son of man was born with no sex desire he didn't have a father on the earth everybody got that amen so that's the son of man now when we say the son of man but now he had to come to a position as the son of man to to take this redemption plan to another level right all right everybody got that so isaiah 57 verse 14 says the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son now that's not that's the son of man the son she bore was the son of man now the son of god inhabited that son of man because the son of god is what spirit god that's the holy ghost remember gabriel said you'll be overshadowed by the holy ghost and even brother branham says oh you say that that jesus had a father and his you know he had a father his name was jehovah and he was all this he said what about the bible tells you that the holy ghost was his daddy you get all messed up see when you try to break that apart but you just got to see that the one that spoke it went inside that body the only one that could do that the only one that could bring life out of no sexual desire amen but now see remember though we were all born messed up so he had to come unmessed up for the little ones unmessed up so that he could make us take what we messed up right and unmiss it if that's a word but that's a good way of putting it because that's what the son of man came to do the son of man came to save human beings amen and then he could take that piece of him or part of him and he could take that flesh back to heaven or to heaven or to a seventh dimension everybody wants seventh dimension let's just say seventh dimension and then he sent back that son of god again amen the holy ghost the son of man didn't come back on the day of pentecost because there was no it wasn't his flesh came back but now he sent the holy ghost into human flesh again to make them sons and daughters of god but not a position of the son of man right right everybody all right with that amen all right so now i want you to keep having to back your mind because we're going to roll through some things back to what we were talking about because look he had to come to the jews brother donnie was reading that scripture in isaiah that was the very scripture that i've been quoting you through what paul and them were saying though i turned to the gentiles and we'll read it in a minute because there was a promise of the gentiles to be coming to for gentiles to come in but in the old testament it was not that it was in the old testament that the gentiles was to come in through the jews jews were the bride and then there was going to be a gentile saved right that's what they were saying in the old testament they knew gentiles was going to have a part of it because man you can't explain rahab even abraham all the different ones that they you know pinned their their uh religion on there's always a gentile popped in there somewhere and it's not a pure line of the jews but the problem was once they started messing up or started going whoring as we read in the scripture they went off god had to put them away so when god put him away he's there was the gentile right nations of people he had to put this group of people away and then he had to had this group of people to be his bride because listen god's got to have a body on the earth you say how do you know that well it's all through the scripture why did he write the bible right that's right that's why jesus stood he said look if these people don't cry out he said god will raise rocks up to do it right but he didn't raise rocks up he had people this bible was written to people by people by god through people for people to save people to save human beings and i think i have a quote here that that's what it's it's god was given god give the new birth to human beings so that human beings could be redeemed or regenerated back to what that genesis 1 26 man that was back before the foundation of the world everybody okay with that behold the virgin shall conceive and bring forth a child shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name emmanuel and then the bible keeps telling us that that emmanuel is what god with us and in other words finally god was our kinsman he was in human flesh as we were reading if you look at boaz and ruth that's the perfect type of of of what that he was what was boaz a man he wasn't portraying the son of god he was portraying the son of man because he was saving somebody that was on earth right he was restoring ruth i mean naomi to get ruth and remember ruth was a gentile naomi was a jew naomi's son was a jew but naomi's son that married he married ruth which was a moabite which was like me and you the brother brother brother mama said a hair and a biscuit because moab was started by white lot and his two daughters having children all right so look what god does though he uses that to show the son of man all the way back in in ruth and boaz that there stood boaz a human man that that could be kinsmen to naomi but in getting naomi in redeeming naomi he gets roots so in redeeming the jews or to bring the jews he gets a bright a gentile bride right but he is going to bring israel back we know that by daniel 70 let's read isaiah 53 just fly through this real quick he was taken from prison and from judgment who shall declare his generation for he was cut off of the land of living now see remember what we were talking about just reached just now what genealogy is he declaring because a generation is a genealogy what genealogy is he declaring not israel who's going to declare his generation the bride right the ones that are his progeny are his genealogy his spiritual genealogy he's not going to forget israel but now they have no line as far it looked if even in the natural like i said before i'm not gonna preach on marriage and divorce but still you gotta hold it where god put her away she went whoring in other words she went and went into um trying to get this right making love to other gods and see if your wife leaves you and does that you can't take her back so he can't take he can't restore her back even god almighty can't go by what aft go over what his word says right right so he can't take her back now he she's still there she's going to have a position but she can't be bright anymore she can't be the body of christ anymore so now you and i though being the body of christ we shall declare we're the only ones that can declare since the day of pentecost that's what's being half that's what's been happening his generation has been declared through seven church ages all right as the son of god though not the son of man now it's really tricky because you got to be careful that is the son of god down through seven church ages working in human flesh but they don't have enough men of the ministry of jesus christ to make it completely the son of man in the end time we'll get to that in just a little while okay who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken because remember jesus didn't have any children so there was no genealogy for him natural so where was his children started on the day of pentecost 120 little jesuses were born and now you've got it all down to the church ages many other little jesuses are born by what regening of our mind amen and not an exchange of our soul but take that soul and clean it up right that's the business of the son of god everybody got that when you receive the new birth you receive the son of god in your soul which makes you the children of god now that made the children of god down through the seven church ages but at the end time though all the mystery of god should be finished so there was a mystery that wasn't finished in the other church ages that's right let's read verse 10 save time yet it please the lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sinners shall see a seed listen there you go back where's what's progeny what's genealogy what's generations that includes the seed of man natural genealogies but he will only see his seed he gave his life so that he could see his seed right that's what he said he made his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed now who is his seed his seed started on the day of pentecost and continued to this day not back in the old testament he put them away so he couldn't have seen he couldn't have a bride through that group right i'm trying to watch my words here to not be you know i don't want to get too hard for the kids to understand but he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand that's me and you he gave his soul an offer now listen he died for everybody but he knows who would accept and who wouldn't accept who would be bride and who would not be bride now that you should know that john 1 verse 11 says he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many that's me and you as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god now he didn't just say okay you're a son of god he had he had to place his seed there to be children of god you got to be children of your parents you've got to have the seed of the parents inside of you or the genealogy of the parents well jesus didn't have a knife he had natural seed but he never never used it but it was spiritual seed the word of god is the spiritual seed that you and i need to worry about not all this other genealogy you know paul even looks at him he says i'm tired of your endless genealogies so and so but god so and so on so and so we got so and so and that was okay in the old testament because to me the old testament was a recorder it recorded genealogy because it was important in the old testament he said keep your gene line clean don't mingle with them people out there and the problem with it was they didn't listen to that but they they did but as many as received them to him what gave the them power to become the sons of god even to them they believe on his name which were born not of blood see there we go not a blood because see if you're born of blood that makes you blood can your blood can to people on the earth but not to god you got to be born what again see very simple which were born not of blood so boom you can stop it right there he's not talking about flesh that's right he's talking about your new birth which is covered by the blood of jesus christ not the blood of your mom and daddy not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of god so that pretty much brought it right down together and and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us i got a quote brother brown meets in the rising of the sun he said who is this son of man he said in the beginning was a word he quotes this scripture right here see he took it all the way back to the beginning john 1 14 brings it to when he was made flesh but that was the whole part of jesus's whole the whole plan the whole plan we know it it's based on resurrection but it's based on him becoming flesh and then getting in flesh because in the in the genesis that's what stopped god from becoming flesh was the natural act between adam and eve the womb was closed up there was no way god could get to any one of them spiritually anymore the way he wanted to to create his children because he didn't want him sexually he wanted them by spoken seed word of god satan knew that too satan knew it and that's why he perverted it he went straight to the very one thing he knew could stop god from coming in human flesh and then what did satan start doing he started coming down and anointing that human flesh that's why in the old testament you had problems you had david and all the different ones that did the things killed people and and all that moses was a murderer but he was the biggest prophet that ever was in the old testament but he murdered he murdered an egyptian because he didn't have the new birth but the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory is of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth now listen and now i'm saying to you that the word is being made flesh again and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory as thinking brother dale was preaching this morning when you look at the son of man it's not in one man anymore i just proved that there was only one position for the son of man to come thee and thee constitutes one person he came and did what he was supposed to do in that time slot that's what i was trying to get the time slot he came and did what he's supposed to do now it was the son of god through the church ages we're going to read where brother brown says that but now right at the end time the son of man's got to come back but he's not he was the son of man with no bride and nobody at that moment that he was here everybody got that think with me a minute that when jesus was on earth there was no bride that's right because it brides his body he had a natural body there he couldn't have two bodies right he had already put israel away before he got here really he came to his own but he knew they weren't going to accept it so he couldn't take him as bride so he came to me and you in that time slot the son of man the only man that could die be buried resurrected and not just come back see look lazarus died was buried and was resurrected but he died again and the the soul of lazarus even though as pure as we may think it is by the new birth if he was ever born again never was shown he was but if he was he couldn't be the son of man because he died again literally died physically let's put it that way he physically died but jesus comes out of the grave and he said i am alive forevermore i have the keys of death in hell we read that in the book of revelation he had overtook the grave hell death and everything and he said i don't have to die anymore so there's the person we want to talk to that's right right now you say oh now be careful well our attitude's gonna have to change from being a second person to of of god to being collectively now the son of man i said collectively because remember he came as one person he does not have to come back as one person anymore he's done his job he filled his time slot as the son of man then he was the son of god through seven church ages but there held the re who said i am the resurrection and the life the son of man said i am the resurrection and the life amen and then in the end time god had to show just for a moment another time slot between the 40s and the 50s and the 60s through one man he showed what was supposed to be done in the end time according to luke 17 30 when the son of man was to come back in the end time but now brother branham was not the son of man he was a son of man you and i are all the son of man in a collective not one person you can't fulfill that because listen you know why you can't fulfill it none of you sitting here with virgin born right but now by the new birth that's why you've got to cover you've got to watch your scripture and cover the quotes where you're talking natural and where you're talking spiritual because by the spiritual birth yes we are we weren't we are all virgins by the spiritual birth but by the natural birth we're not right we're all born in sin we're all born by sex we all came the exact same way i don't care if you preach king i don't care if you have a billion dollars we all came the same way and if time goes on we're all going out the same way but jesus filled that slot i am the resurrection in the life i am the way the truth and the life as brother brown said in the quote we were talking about he didn't come to bring you your redemption your redemption was already over here but he knew that it got lost and then as it got lost he had to come and bring it away for you to get back to it to be regened or regenerated to be able to declare that general listen what generation was he declaring was he telling us to declare genesis 1 26-27 that's all his children that's his progeny that's that's what he came for and man that genesis why i said that's the most important for you to understand that genesis 1 26 man if you had if you weren't there you're not going to be there he didn't come to get you but if you buy the new birth if you ever get born again you were there no way you can miss it right and you weren't there in no form except in god i'm telling you folks if you get a true revelation the problem with a lot of people is they're not born again like i said before we need to just face this thing look in the mirror have you ever asked if you ever have you ever asked yourself hey buddy you born again you wake up look at that thing in the mirror every day in this worst form amen look at that thing and say are you born again do you know that you know that you know because you know what i don't look in the mirror and see brother john that'd be weird especially in the morning in my bathroom but i see me and you see you that's our worst enemy your worst enemy is not somebody in your classmate they're not no your worst enemy is you but if we can look at ourself and honestly say god if i'm not born again please please birth me into this body i want it more than anything i won't go to work today if i knew it hell don't be lazy not go to work though okay the fedex guy i'm glad you got a job there though that's good but the word was made flesh and dwelt among us in this time period right here but now he left and he said i'm coming back see lazarus couldn't say i'm coming back abraham couldn't say i'm coming back none of those could say i'm coming back but there was one man standing on earth he said i can come back i can do this thing you destroy this temple i'll raise it up in three days you do whatever you need to do because remember his soul is what is going to save you not his body he gave his soul a ransom so he could see a seed he gave his soul so that you know what he'd done he went down and met the devil and said look i'm here right now i've come in human flesh it's laying up there in the tomb you can go up there i'm sure the devil knew where it was at anyway he said you can go up there and look he said i died for them but now today you're going to give me the keys of death and hell you've held it for several thousand years you're going to hand it to me today and i'm going back up and i'm going to save these people and the devil because there's nothing he couldn't try to block it there's no way in hell he could do it right no way he couldn't do it hell couldn't stop him the devil couldn't stop him nobody could stop what he was going to do why because he had already listened he raised on the scripture he died by scripture he lived by scripture because he was the scripture but now what about me and you he said no no i'm this over here i was born in sin i've got all these problems well get born again you might have them but you'll know how to deal with them you'll know how to deal with them and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and beheld the glory and glory of the only begotten of the father for the grace and truth now jeremiah 3 verse 8 and i saw when for all the causes were by backsliding israel committed adultery i had put her away and give her a bill of divorcement yet her treacherous sister judah feared not but went and played the harlot also so we know that we read there in romans let's just go to romans real quick that blindness in part has happened to israel until the fullness of the gentiles become in now what about a man i was thinking about this other day what about a man lived 30 years 33 years jesus and he walked on earth now he comes to his ministry he's around jews the whole time he goes to the temple he's 13 years old he goes to the temple there's a lot of things that he does in this temple but when he comes to his ministry on the river jordan and the holy ghost anoints him for his message i believe he realizes hey i've not come to this people right because he said he said john said he came to his own but now he over in the scripture he talks about going to the lost sheep of the house of israel oh yeah so in his mind he's going i think i'm going to try and he did try to convert him why did he go to the why did he go to the to the temples why did he go to the feast days why did he go to these different places because he wanted to convert them he wanted them to believe who he was right but they didn't believe him and then finally he just said forget it because even paul even paul with the holy ghost paul tried his best to get the jews to believe it right that's right because there were a certain group of jews that did believe it 120 in the upper room were all jews but when they dispersed out with the 3000 it was people all over the place and look where paul went if you look at his map paul went all over asia in different places trying to convert and set up churches and he was meeting jews in every little spot and there and they're like oh we're going to stone him we're going to kill him we're going to drive him off of a cliff he's a mad man we don't want to hear anything from him and then all of a sudden he says lo i turned to the gentiles he had had enough he didn't want no more of it he had had enough but he's the one that wrote in romans oh yeah see paul wrote this for i would not brother that you should be ignorant of this mystery unless you should be wise in your own conceit that blindness in part happened to israel until the fullness of the gentiles be come in and so all israel shall be saved as it is written there shall come out of zion the deliverance shall turn away ungodliness from jacob that's each quote in scripture but this is my covenant unto them when i shall take away their sin now according to daniel 7 to which in daniel 9 24 that's what happened he redeems israel as part of this eternal plan he redeems israel when i shall take away their sins as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sake but as touching the election they are beloved for the father's sake so the blindness in part though is going to be taken away because right now like i said before right now they don't want to have no part with a gentile they still believe the messiah is going to come to them by elijah and the elijah cup and listen the the real good orthodox jew has never strayed away from the bible now the ones dad and him met over in jerusalem was common people they didn't care about they were just jews right they were just jews they were just like us they were just born but they happened to be born jews but now the real true orthodox jew sits there and believes that elijah's gonna come and then the messiah's going to come they literally believe that's going to happen and then when you take the gospel why did why did god stop william branham from going to israel because he knew they would accept it that's what brother brown kept saying man they'll accept this and that person said well they'll accept this brother brown you take them out here on the plane and you show them what was he going to show them the sign of the son of man the messiah is god in human flesh amen that's what messiah will be that's why i asked that priest he said well what will messiah be he said brother adam he'll be god in human flesh well that's what he wants already so he could brother brown on either broke every scripture in the world in the whole bible if god would allowed him to go you wouldn't have needed two prophets because israel would have been born in a day right there but see that was the elijah anointing i believe of william branham trying to get over there i said the anointing of elijah because you know what the anointing of elijah is it's to turn the jews back because what's number five gonna do gonna turn the jews back that fifth message of elijah is going to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children right and they're going to get born again the old the old fathers the old orthodox fathers he's going to turn them into newborn babes in christ it's just all it's just a cycle of of elijah that's his ministry is to turn the hearts back even the first elijah he said lord i pray even on carmel they'll turn that this will turn their heart back so that's happened the whole time so daniel 9 24 says 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon that holy city now it's going to do six things and this is all going to happen now look this is all going to happen when we're gone because he can't save them while we're here right right so this six-fold purpose is not going to happen while we're here okay the six-fold purpose will only happen after we leave all right know therefore and understand from the going forth commandment to restore and build jerusalem see they're going to build a temple even while we're while we're up in another dimension they're going to come back down here and build a millennium temple so all this has got like brother dale many times he showed me that this is it's a parable to us because none of this is happening while we're here us today physically everybody got that because remember messiah was cut off 2000 years ago peter may have been there and john may have been there but physically you and i were not there right amen and after three score in two weeks shall my side be cut off according to isaiah 53 he was cut off from the land of the living okay it was cut off they thought they got rid of him but what happened is it brought him to where he could come inside me and you where the cell was broken so that he could bring life to me and you and then the prince is going to destroy the city we know that was titus that was a gentile and he shall confirm the covenant of many for one week now we know one thing's for sure we're not here when this covenant signed so that one week has got to happen after the rapture takes place so whatever you hear anyone preach if it's not if it's half weeks and half this just forget about it it's not bible 69 weeks have already happened there's one week left from 69 weeks to one week to the one week there's a 2 000 year gap of gentile bride that's what we've been reading because in luke 24 verse 46 jesus said thus it is written and dusted behoove christ the suffering rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at jerusalem and your witness of these things and behold i'll send the promise of my father upon you now what was the promise he had already told him that he was going to send the holy ghost he was going to send the comforter and behold i send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high and that word endue means what to sink into you see there's a difference in being anointed by the holy ghost and being filled by the holy ghost many anointings and when i say filling i mean filling down in the soul not filling on your spirit that's just an anointing so that holy ghost sank into peter and john and all the different ones that were in the upper room and then they became sons and daughters of god and there started the progeny of jesus christ or isaiah 53 to be fulfilled because it was the filling of the holy ghost but now listen that was the son of god dispensation began i'll read it to you in a few minutes where brother brown said the son of god dispensation started on the day of pentecost it started through the seven church ages went through seven church ages the son of god which was the holy ghost and the people everybody okay with that for those of you that are awake acts 13 verse 46 just keep on rolling down through them because they spoke with thomas we know it dispersed everywhere but we turn to the gentiles see in the book of acts when the first began paul and barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary the word of god should first have been spoken to you who'd you talk to the jews listen god give them an opportunity to repent and they turned him down he was standing there in human flesh and they turned him down see what they'll do if they turn you down same thing so revelations 1. so then after we turn to the gentiles we see in revelations 1 verse 13 down to verse 20. let's go to 20. you know these things we're just going to try to glean i try to get to the end where we can read some quotes for brother i'm talking about the son of man the mystery of the seven stars which now saw us in our right hand and the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thousa are the seven churches now brother branham preached the church ages and then he preached the seals right preached to church ages in 60 they compiled the book and then in 1963 he preached the seals see the seals wouldn't have come out right if he had not if he had switched them or had not preached that to me one of the most important series would be that church age series because he named dave he got all the dates right he got all the people right and he got all the characteristics and all that right because it was in the bible but now see these angels which are messengers no one was ever able to say okay number one was paul number two was irenaeus number three was martin columba all the way down but god sent us a prophet and then i don't see how in the world people why did god waste his time on william branham if he's wrong maybe i'll wake some of you up cause y'all bad sleeping today bob it's bad but ain't nothing to do about it the seven stars are the angels how no one ever said no one ever had enough of the word of god to stand up and say paul was the first church age messenger because who would you pick who did you pick for number two because all you're going by is history but i believe god gave william branham a vision of exactly who it was so you and i could have what confidence in what that man said confidence in what the prophet of god said to tell us who these seven angels are and that they're men they were messengers with a message and they brought a message to a group of people and that group of people accepted or rejected that church age messenger what a wonderful god and then when brother brown gets finished with the whole series god plasters it on the back wall of the of the tabernacle showing even the of course we don't have the the one with the lines on it that has the black and white the round circles but they said somebody was testifying that had been there that it just it just like somebody was writing it and drawing the whole thing drawing well it wasn't man and it wasn't the devil because the devil would have got it wrong it had to be god it had to be god vindicating what like i said one more time why did god waste his time on such a man that's right if he wasn't our messenger why would he waste time and yeah come on we gotta either believe it or get in or get out one one of the two but the greek lexicon says the star is what a messenger not just a messenger but a messenger from god amen okay this messenger didn't come from the antichrist these messengers came from god these church age messengers were the seven stars now why couldn't god get it right he had seven of them in his hand so see if william branham was wrong god's wrong you see how it just keeps rolling backwards that's what god that's what satan wants you to believe that god's not right and no other body else is right but him yeah so you know where that statement comes in it comes from the devil amen but god promised us according to revelations 10 7 that he would send us a seventh messenger from god read revelation 10 7 he sent a messenger from god the seventh church aged messenger will come from god and this mystery will be finished as he has declared it to all the other prophets so let's read number one spoken words original seed is right here the messenger of malachi 4 will appear at god's appointed time we're all looking for him we believe he will come that is according to his word it will be at the end time which it is time now for to see it he will be correctly dedicated to the word as they have always been indicated by god's word and a vindicated god will vindicate what the preacher what he preaches to be the truth as he did elijah for is is elijah coming making ready for the mount zion rapture okay rapture couldn't take place in any other age but this age so he sent a messenger with a rapture message with a resurrection message amen now let's read number two now see if we don't get this right then we've only got malachi 4 coming in william branham just to bring us back to the faith of the fathers right and the faith of the fathers all those fathers are passed away been in the grave for 2000 years right amen they had the pure word of god but they didn't have that revelation of the mystery of the seals that jesus was trying to get preached in matthew 24. okay we'll get to in just a second i'm getting ahead of myself according to malachi 4 and revelations 10 7. so brother brown brought in malachi 4 but he also had to bring in revelation 10 7 to do the two things all right he's going to do two things one according to malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers now children the hearts of the children when he started on in 19 whatever 33 in the different times he was talking to pentecostal babies all right that thought that that was it this is the coming of the lord this is the latter rain movement this is the this is the last he said y'all ain't even got the first yet you think how much they hated him when they put their whole thing on this right here this azusa street and everything going after that the gifts and all that but what did they do they cabbage down when you don't know what cabbage down means a cabbage is a little low plant that doesn't move you have to pick it so they what did they do they said this is it this is the moo this is the last move of god if you don't speak in tongues you ain't got the holy ghost if you don't believe this and that and the other you ain't got the holy ghost if you don't believe us you don't have the holy ghost and then brother brown comes along and says okay i'll take that but or plus he said i'll take that speaking in tongues is good these evidences are good but it's not the evidence of the holy ghost and he spent years trying to teach those babbling babies the faith of the fathers back to the day of pentecost where it wasn't speaking in tongues that gave them the holy ghost they spoke in tongues after they got the holy ghost and some of most of that was in another language that everybody understood so it was not in the speaking it was in the hearing so faith comes by speaking faith comes by hearing all right they heard a message from peter and got the holy ghost two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelations 10 remember revelation 10 about four five and six he told john not to write them he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths so the devil can't take that and bring it to you only god is divine divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts now listen i preached this a long time ago but literally is not a type literally it's not i'm not standing up here as a type of samuel wade dale ii i'm literally the man so the literal son of man in bride form right amen in bribe form has to be in the end time i said in bribe form not in that time slot that he was the son of man the person one man right he has now a morphed me morphy and morphed himself into a bride to be though by the revelation of these thunders and the seals which are the same it's going to literally turn us back to the pentecostal fathers and i don't believe that's the pentecostal fathers anywhere you've ever seen in your life everything's a base sure we have a pentecostal basis in paul's age the book of acts and all these different things but you know what this pentecostal revival is going to change our body exactly this pentecostal revival is going to raise the dead and it's not going to raise the listen and we'll get to that maybe next sunday or a couple sundays from now there are brother dale's preaching the resurrection i'm preaching the resurrection now remember there are several types of resurrection lazarus was resurrected temporarily when when brother dale spoke to the um to randall several years ago and he came back from the dead that was temporary that wasn't the resurrection that was a resurrection because just this past year randall passed away physically okay but there jesus see there was a temporary resurrection when lazarus came forth because lazarus came out of the grave he was changed he had to be changed because the bible says he stinketh it wasn't cause he didn't have a bath he was dead for four days in that 90-something degree humid weather brother brown said and you know martha said he stinks lord he had to have a some kind of a change that's right but now remember if it when he came out of the grave though he continued on to an old age and he passed away right right temporary resurrection also there's a resurrection from out of dead words there's an out resurrection in the bible we'll cover that later on that paul says i want to be in that resurrection why he wants to he listen if you're not resurrected today by the new birth sitting in heavenly places you can forget about the first resurrection right that's right because you're not going to make it now you'll make the second one but you'll never make the first one right so now listen in these two excuse me these two messages two things two things one and two see one and two one it was temporary resurrection right because there was a healing campaign there was people resurrected from the dead right number one according to mankind for you turn the hearts of the children to the father's children what children to the fathers were where paul and all the different ones man they had resurrections everywhere peter and different ones and they'd lay their hands on them or even some people you know would be in the shadow of peter and get healed anytime you get healed that's a temporary resurrection because you were dying you were dead according to the world but alive in jesus christ if you're born again but this first one according to malachi 4 turned the hearts of the children to the fathers now remember the first part of his message was a healing campaign right right from 47 to 63 remember we got all the quotes you've heard him that he said it's not in the years of preparation but now remember you can't throw it away because he said it was preparation okay it was preparation it was preparing you for something the problem was is people got blinded during that preparation time and thought that brother branham was the son of man or he was god and he was this and that and the other yeah but they totally missed number two because number two has the resurrection in it that you'll never die again one temporary resurrection everybody understand what i'm saying nod your head or don't bat you out you'll fall asleep according to malcolm 4 he'll turn the hearts of the children to the fathers what miracles miracles happen in the old testament i mean in the first part of the church age at church age number one acts is full of miracles book of acts but now remember brother branham said that he in one of his services there was more healing than what was in jesus whole life that's saying something that's right when you got 200 something thousand outstanding miracles in one service in india i'm just telling you what he said and jesus probably never had that many in his three and a half year message so you see what we had we had we had a preparation time that no one has ever had before god prepared us through william branham showing and you know how many of and i do i love to put on a tape and then get to the end and have the prayer line but which one was more important right right the parts you skip and i do enjoy you know somebody did a compilation of just just just the prayer lines and that's good because it helps you build faith but listen if it just if it just shows me that william branham did these things then it's just a waste of time right right right yeah it's a waste of time because it's doing you no good you're filling up time you're just listening to something that happened 50 years 60 years ago but when you say god that's you speaking to me i want the same thing i want the same thing those people were under because we get both of these right they didn't catch number two folks on the sixth seal brother brown said it's gone from you what's gone from them number two everybody with me they got this but they perverted it brother brown being god brother remember the son of man brother around this and listen some of them i don't blame because those people that spent time with brother branham day in and day out and you see things happen and and he'd say don't go over there there's going to be a snake over there under that or don't you know do this and don't do that hey there's some game over there on ridge number two and then it all just comes to pass never is it well this might happen he tells them exactly what's going to happen and it happens but that was to get their attention to the real message that was coming and he was trying for all those years to get their attention to the message that was coming because he knew the message was coming and when he got to the seals he said not in the years of preparation hey listen folks we're going to read it here in just a minute or maybe we won't but do you know william branham stood one day and preached the indictment he indicted a whole generation of people in other words he brought a charge against the whole denominational world at that moment now that's close to being god almighty but listen that was god almighty speaking through him because he said i indict this generation he's trying to preach a resurrection message a message with resurrection and rapture in it and they're putting jesus back on the cross again and he he had all his kids down god had all he could stand he knew him god was going to have to do that because a man can't indict a generation but god threw a man could stand up one day and said i indict this whole generation for the second crucifixion of jesus christ in other words i'm trying to preach you the resurrection and you're trying to put that same resurrected lord jesus that's still alive and well tonight you're putting him back on the cross to crucify him again and you know what the bible said it would happen let's read number three feast of the trumpet so remember with number one message that the prophet brought there was temporary resurrection because the sick was healed the dead was raised and even into the second one but his message was in that second part that would literally turn us back that's literally going to change our body to where we're going we're not going to have a raisin from the dead one day and die the next folks there's got to be somebody that takes this message and says i'm not going to die and it can only be by the son of man not the son of god son of man's already died one time he don't have to die again if i got it now listen let's look at number three feast of the trumpets now he's been revealed through the church ages now watch through the church ages as son of god god being a spirit the holy spirit he revealed himself in the church ages as in the congregation as the holy spirit among the people listen they were spirit-filled people they were god's bride for that time they were born again just as born again as you are they just didn't have enough word to carry them on through they didn't have a prophet on the scene they had reformers didn't have a prophet luther was a reformer wesley was a reformer we find and allow to sin church age the last church age he is put out of the church nowhere else was he ever put out in other words crucifying him again but in the loudest in age because they said we're rich and have need of nothing and know it not that you're miserable poor and naked blind and don't know it he was put out of the church age this church age and then according to luke 17 he said as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man now he was reading the same genesis that we read notice that sodom what had taken place let's go to number four this is one i think brother dale read this morning queen of sheba jesus said as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man look at that angel down there to the church elect to what he'd done look at jesus what he'd done in his generation look down here at this generation what he's doing now look they'll receive a sign it's like brother dale said they'll receive a sign but they won't believe it they're going to get it because the bible says they're going to get this sign that's what it means by receiving it but listen they're not going to make it they're not going to act on it right they're going to say it's false they're going to hang him back up on the cross again there you are but it comes just the same an evil and adulterous generation will seek after a sign and they'll have it it'll be given to them as jonah was in the belly of the well three days and night so the son of man will be in the heart of the earth three days and nights but the resurrection will be the sign and the resurrection sign is given to the church in this last days not the resurrection sign temporary he's talking about the resurrection to get the dead saints out of the ground amen the angel of the holy spirit in the meetings showing the same thing doing the same thing across the nation proving that jesus christ is raised from the dead just the same yesterday today and forever that's the generation that will receive it and that's why you read the scripture who shall declare this generation listen there's generation that declared luther's message there's a generation that declared wesley's message but this generation is declaring the what message the message of the son of man to not just declare it but to what be it that's the generation that will receive it that's me and you listen even job in 14 12 so man lies down and rises not till the heavens be no more they shall not await nor be raised out of their sleep oh that thou would has hide me in the grave that thou would just keep me secret until the wrath be passed that thou would have to point me a set time and remember me if a man dies shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will i wait till my change comes boy he he knew something there didn't he even in the old testament thou shalt call and i will answer thee thou will have a desire of the work of thy hands let's read this if everything's based on resurrection let's read this definition of resurrection resurrection is a state of having passed completely through death and having risen from death now look completely passed through death and resurrected from death to be in resurrection is different than to be alive right to be alive is the original state now i want you to look at that word alive because paul says down here a little bit further we're probably not going to get to it he says those who are alive and remain to be alive is the original state without having the past having passed through death to be in resurrection is to have passed through death and have been raised up right right now that's where we got to get into the separate resurrections and we don't have time to do that it's almost 3 30. because you can have a temporary resurrection and you can die again like i said before if you have been born again this afternoon you've already been resurrected sitting in heavenly places your soul is eternal as god is as eternal as it ever will be waiting on the body this is the body the son of man literally his body went in the ground can't kill the son of god though that's what went to hell preached to the souls in prison you were with him but resurrection is a state of having passed completely through death and having risen from death now remember if you're a christian you can't die you can physically go but but once you're born again you can't die let's read first corinthians 15 verse 12. i like this scripture it wasn't one that i had the other day let's read this just for a moment first corinthians which is based on resurrection there you go now if christ be preached now watch this he's preaching to corinthians now if christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead as brother dale's talking about the sadducees and the different ones but if there be no resurrection of the dead then is christ not risen read that but if there be no resurrection of the dead then is christ's not risen look and if if christ be not risen then is our preaching vain if jesus christ didn't raise from the dead folks what are we preaching amen a dead god that we don't know where he's at he's still in the tomb that's why brother brown makes all that different analogy about muhammad and buddha and all them he said their tomb's not empty he said we serve a god that the tomb is empty and if christ be not risen then is our preaching vain and your faith is also vain whatever you believe in is vanity if you don't believe that jesus christ resurrected from the dead and not only that he resurrected from the dead but he came back inside of me in you listen to first corinthians 15 verse 20 but now now he's continuing his thought from first corinthians 15 12 to first corinthians 15 20. but now has christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead glory son of man came to resurrection of the dead amen for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive but every man in his own order church ages christ the first fruits afterwards they that are christ at his coming now what coming are we looking for he's already here by what the prophet's already told us so revelations 20 verse 4 talks about the first resurrection go down to the bottom we know this but the rest of the dead live not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection that's us the dead saints anybody that's died and with the baptism of the holy ghost they're going to raise in the first resurrection there was a question somebody asked me online and about the people in in the old testament well people in the old testament can't come up in the first resurrection none of them can first resurrection is just for the bride it's just for the bride no one else this is not this and i'm sorry if you if you just need to be bribed and if you're bribed then it's not gonna hurt your feelings but if your mama brother sister mother and all them other people ain't born again they ain't coming up in the first resurrection i don't care who they are the first resurrection is he alone for the dead in christ shall rise first amen that's for the people that took that genesis 1 26 and held it this is the first resurrection blessed and holy it's he that has pardoned the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power what is the second death listen if you're dead in christ you're already dead you don't have to die again but now do you know though that somebody that's a sinner if he dies he goes into the fifth dimension and he's got to be resurrected in that same condition at the second resurrection and then he's gonna die again eventually he's going to just go away right but not a christian we die in christ we're already dead to the world sure we might have to go to sleep that's what the bible says sleep on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priests of god and of christ and shall reign with him for one thousand years first thessalonians 4 13 real quick these are all scriptures and i think i read some of them last week first corinthians 4 verse 13 says but i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are what dead no sleep that you saw not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive i just read you that a minute ago if you're alive you're not you don't need to be resurrected physically you're alive if we are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep now right here is where it took a prophet to finish this shout out listen how many of you have heard denominational boy when that trumpet sounds yo when that loud voice hey the shout it took a prophet to tell us that the lord descended from heaven with a shout because see they're thinking this is all going to happen and it's going to be everybody's going to see it it's going to be everybody's going to notice me resurrecting oh no oh no no no it's gonna be so secret listen folks them them graves are not gonna be messed up you know i'm gonna run out there and say oh man richard marlowe didn't make it ray gabriel didn't make it their graves are still closed up that don't matter they walk through the wall to get out of here they can walk back through dirt to get up here that's my god that's my part of resurrection that's it but listen all those that went home to be with the lord they heard the shout out and they knew what it was because they had a prophet tell them what that shout was that's right the voice of the archangel they heard that we're waiting on this right here that's a message to get them out of the ground because see after the three and the dead in christ shall rise first and right the dead in christ you say oh now you said they weren't dead no they died before they fell asleep this is dead in christ this is that you're dead in christ today by the new birth you didn't go to a grave dead in christ you died in christ and you just fell asleep because of some issue sickness in the body no shame in that listen we say well it's just real bad well it is it's a bad separation but my would you want to bring any of the folks back no unless they all come back together and here's it again brother john then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord look wherefore comfort one another we had a prophet of god comfort us to tell us where they're at and that they fell asleep under the voice of almighty god they fell asleep under the voice of the resurrection because that's what's going to bring them out of the ground first thessalonians i mean first corinthians let's read this and then we'll be done 15 47 first man is the earth earthy the second man is the lord from heaven as is the earthy such they also that are earthy and as is the heavenly such as they also that are heavenly and as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the heavenly now how we're going to do that by the new birth because that's where genesis 1 26 come from they come from eternity it comes from heaven amen and as we have borne the image of the earthy we also shall bear the image of the heavenly now this i say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god well brother you just said yeah we're going to be changed but our flesh and blood at this moment can't do that exactly right that's why we have graves it's when we have places that we put this corrupt body because corruption doesn't inherit incorruption behold he didn't stop there and say oh that's it we're done you're you're just there's nothing i don't know i don't know what's gonna it first second um what was that left behind where you can get saved maybe afterwards and we don't live under that folks we live under the word of god as plain as it is we know what's going on we know what's going to happen behold i show you one mystery revelation 10 7 says i'm going to show you one mystery now there's a difference in this and what we're living under today this is a prophecy what we're living under is a reality remember i said literal is not a type this is the type because paul is saying we shall not all we shall all be changed now that's not that didn't happen in his time we shall not all sleep that night didn't happen in his time that's a prophecy he was looking at the future knowing there was something coming but now brother branham reads this scripture and he says hey i'm not saying he's coming i'm saying he's here and the resurrection has begun already because he showed all the temporary resurrections during the time of his ministry and now we're looking at the full resurrection what behold i show you one mystery the son of man is on the scene the son of man messages on the scene the resurrection is on the scene brother brown even tells us the resurrection's inside of you why go look for it somewhere else we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump there's that trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption that's why it's called a change this is not going to meet god in the condition it's in can't for this corruption we must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptable shall have put on incorruption he's prophesying and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory you know that's in the old testament that's why paul's quoting it because that's in the old testament o death whereas thy sting o grave where's thy victory the sting of death is sin and the stink strength of sin is the law but thanks be to god which giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ let me read romans skip john 11. we're going to read romans 6 verse 4 and we'll finish right here listen to this therefore we are buried with him by baptism and to death that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life this we read this when we do our baptism because that what is a baptism a baptism shows you made a confession that the old you wanted to die i'm tired of this living like i'm living living right i'm tired of this living i want to death burial resurrection and newness of life see there's another resurrection that's a type everything types resurrection hey even even this in april what what happened in april the whole world had a resurrection stuff started blooming stuff started changing colors leaves went on trees that there wasn't any buds it was just buds at one time and and resurrections all around us folks you know your body regenerates itself already and even in a fallen condition your body does regenerate itself why do you keep i mean are we living we're still alive therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that's why i don't want baptism to be a ritual you see other people make it a ritual the catholic church make it a ritual that if that baby doesn't have infant baptism you know that the baby's going that person goes to hell yeah read your roman catholics that's why they're so adamant about taking that little baby and having it uh what do you call it i they sprinkle it over but it's called something it's infant baptism what it is but if they don't do that that baby has no chance to go to heaven so the catholic church has to sprinkle it and do the infant baptism but we know better than that we know better than that but we also know better that we have put down a lot of people that had not died first because you baptize them and then you don't see them no more they didn't die they just wanted to go through a ritual that thought it would might help them when it probably hurt them worse because they denied the very thing that they went through that's why all this is serious folks it's just not i want to be baptized young people yeah okay but when you get older you ought to know that you you got to die first listen we've buried too many live people right life to their self but if you say god i've had enough of this i am dying out to everything i've done now i want to go be baptized and then we read the scripture for if we have been planted together planted in the likeness of his death we shall also in the lightness shall be in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be what destroyed i love that word you had a destruction not too long ago didn't you it just destroyed whatever that was that was bothering you that henceforth we should not serve sin for in that for he that is dead not literally like some of y'all looking for he that is dead is free from sin do you know if you if you're still alive see if you're the bride of christ and you're still alive you can't marry another husband you can't be married to the devil and be married to christ at the same time one of them's got to be dead right a sinner has this old husband but now if you'll say one day i want my whole husband to die i want a death to happen now for he that is dead is free from sin he that is dead is freed from marriage and divorce because you know what if you're if your wife or your husband dies you're free to marry right only in the lord but you are free to marry why because it had to be a type showing that you what were married to the devil at your birth first birth you were married to the devil and you stayed mad to him forever how long you got till you got sick of that person and then you wanted him dead not like brother brown said you can't hang him up in a closet that's not that's not killing that's not dying that's hanging him up so you can conveniently get him back out when you need him but if it's dead you don't see him no more that's why god told the children of israel he said those egyptians that you saw today what is the red sea death those egyptians you see today you will never see them no more in other words that group will never bother you again because they're what d-e-a-d right and listen if they're dead in anything but christ there is no resurrection except the second one now if we be dead with christ we believe that we shall also live with him so to live with christ you've got to be dead that's right that's right you got to be dead you got to be dead to live with christ listen he died to give you that that opportunity to be dead with him and to be dead with christ you're more alive than anybody in the whole on the whole face of the earth man i never forget let's stand our feet musicians come i can just see the prophet of god staying in that motel and wherever he was at he was telling the story how he was it was a commotion outside in the hallway and opened the door and there was you know those women they're dragging each other down the hallway now this is in the 60s or 50s they were partying let's just put it that way sorry they were partying didn't have half their clothes on and said bro you know i mean here they put god puts them right in front of a prophet right in front of a prophet he happens to be in the same motel that they're having this party right and puts a woman in front of the prophet half-naked how many times has he told you about that right be in the church and what did that woman say whoopee this is life he said little did she know she was dead right and that's what he preached all through his whole time he said what you think's life is death so all the pleasures of the world everything that we see in the world it's all death right it's all temporary folks young kids it's all temporary anything that you got around here is temporary but if you'll get jesus christ in your heart you won't die anymore right all these little things i'll get persecuted i'll get there's a glory that comes past that there's a glory that comes from being dead to this world and not being conformed to the world you say well see it's just like this this age it's this age louise is this age i want it now no i want it yesterday yeah god i gotta do something for me now this no you better hang on just a minute god does it in his own time right right but you tell god you ask him to forgive your sins and then you go to that water and you say god i want to die and i want to be buried because i have a promise that if i die in christ i'll be resurrected glory not to just life mortal life immortal right by the baptism of holy ghost we move into a resurrection that there's no more death we die one time love the lord amen it's good to know this that we know right it's good to know this eternal plan of redemption because it covers you and listen folks if it's an eternal plan of redemption we're going to still be talking about this when when the rapture takes place in the thousand years of millennium and then we go into the future home and we go into the new city or the new city and and we go into all that we're still going to be talking about an eternal redemption how you got saved how you got born again and how all these things happened in your life there's your testimony that's right but you had to die first right because remember if you don't die first you get a second death and it totally annihilates you i want to die here i want to die here let's sing a song god bless you oh my goodness what's the page number 376. 376. we're going to sing the original life [Music] god's attributes were manifested to his bride in this last age we have caught the revelation by the last prophet's message and we know who we are praise the lord for the original life [Music] the original world is what i believe the son of man is [Music] and our names are seen within really imperfect without sin yes we are anointed and inspired by our god it was the original [Music] the original word is [Music] he has opened the and sweet victory [Music] the original word is what i believe the son [Music] full authority empowered sleeping saints will wicked and joined us for translation and it is the [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the original seed the original word is what i believe the son of man is revealed the seventh seal is unveiled the original life the original seed we are called unto adoption full of authority and power sleeping saints will wake and join us for translation and desire [Music] again in the name of jesus christ [Music] is [Music] give me revelations [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the original [Music] now i want to ask you a question before we leave we now know who the son of man is no one understood the son of man when he was on earth no one understand understood fully the son of man in the church ages right we know that we see all that but now in the end time we understand the very character of that son of man amen glory that's it that's the character of the son of man because that's what he portrayed in human flesh is that statue of a perfect man he portrayed all those he was the headstone so he wasn't a type he was a literal person but now i want to ask you a question are we a type that's not the faith of jesus christ made into the faith of wade dale or the faith of wade dale made in the faith of jesus christ that is the faith of jesus christ i've got to put myself in there and make myself available for that ad listen peter didn't say get your preacher to add he stood up and said add to your faith [Music] add to your faith virtue and to your virtue you add knowledge you it's an individual affair with god that's right you had it you've got to do it you've got something to do with this and it's the son of man now i see the son of man we shake hands with the son of man we hug the son of man we speak to the son of man and your sisters yes you are included in that too but we don't hug you in all those things you understand but this is the son of man we're looking at now if you have that revelation listen there's a lot of people stuck in the son of god revelation amen if you're stuck in the son of god revelation you're not going to take a body change you might have to pass away and then take a body change because that's what's going to cleanse you because we plant you in corruption and raise you in incorruption but why can't we believe that the prophet of god told us one time and i think i'll try to find that quote that corruption met its master at the tomb of lazarus corruption now who was standing at the tomb of lazarus the son of man and the son of man said i am the resurrection and the life and today in the end time where is that son of man he's in me and you he is portraying in me and you exactly the same jesus i'll read you a quote next sunday or a couple of sundays where brother brown said if we can get the same message of jesus christ here he said there will be a resurrection he said bro wait i think we got it here yeah it's here but there's little pieces that are missing right i said little teeny pieces that are missing to this puzzle it may be that you need to get born again it may need then i need to get born again it may need may mean that we need to get out from right here and get on up here hey man but everything is here for us to get out of here with look there's no other message there's no other messenger there's no other body of christ that's going to raise up somewhere else this is the generation that's going to declare right the resurrection and it's not going to be to the world that's right it's secret yes right i mean honestly folks take this message this morning and this message this afternoon and play it to people 90 of the people of the world they will not know what you're talking about that's right i mean play it to the copelands and play it today they'll you know what they'll say oh you're quoting that brandon man no i ain't quoting the brown of man i'm quoting jesus christ man amen he's the son of man he's the only the son of man william brown was not he was a part of it he introduced us isn't that what isn't that what john did he introduced the messiah brother branham introduced us to the messiah that we need for the end time see they didn't need him in luther's day as as much full because there was no resurrection but according to luke 17 30 revelations 10 7 and malachi 4 it had to come in the end time my time and your time to declare this generation amen you love the lord man if you don't mind go downstairs in my son or my old sunday school class and we'll get everything together do not forget tuesday night come to service tuesday don't come wednesday or you'll be coming by yourself but come tuesday seven o'clock my brother uh um jorge will be here rivas from columbia okay right yeah and brother luis will be interpreting for
