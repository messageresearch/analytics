[0:00] until the white Throne judgment right
[0:02] cuz there's going to be a judgment
[0:04] right what of what they did right a fish
[0:09] virgin cup of water in my name um
[0:12] anybody that's given eternal life that's
[0:14] got to happen at the white Throne
[0:18] judgment I protest by your rejoicing
[0:21] which I have in Christ Jesus our lord I
[0:24] Die daily Paul is saying you still even
[0:27] though we come to a position which still
[0:30] have to Die daily right if after the
[0:33] manner of men I have fought with beast
[0:35] at Ephesus what an advantage is it me if
[0:39] the dead rise not let us eat drink for
[0:42] tomorrow we die in other words Paul is
[0:44] saying that there's not a
[0:45] resurrection MH we're in trouble
[0:49] right we don't see all things but we see
[0:52] Jesus right Paul said we which you know
[0:55] verse 51 he comes and
[0:57] shows right here what he's talking
[0:59] talking about but I show you a mystery
[1:01] we shall not sleep we should be changed
[1:04] all
[1:05] right verse 33 be not deceived evil
[1:08] Communications corrupt good
[1:10] manners await to righteousness and sin
[1:13] not for some have not the knowledge of
[1:16] God I speak this to your shame but some
[1:20] men will say how are the dead raised up
[1:22] and with what body do they come question
[1:27] thou fool
[1:31] well it be hard to say to somebody ask
[1:32] you a
[1:34] question y think I talk
[1:36] that th
[1:39] fool that which thou sest is not
[1:41] quickened except it
[1:44] die in other words what put it in the
[1:46] ground die come back up and that which
[1:51] thou sest thou sest not the body that
[1:53] shall be but bear grain it may chance of
[1:56] wheat or some other grain but God giveth
[1:58] it a body as it has pleased him into
[2:00] ever seed his own body All Flesh is not
[2:03] the same flesh but there is one kind of
[2:04] Flesh of man another flesh of Beast a
[2:07] fish and another
[2:08] Birds then he goes into Celestial and
[2:11] terrestrial bodies but what we're coming
[2:14] to the end of now is is we're
[2:16] showing this son of man had to come into
[2:19] human flesh because that's where we sin
[2:24] we sinned in human flesh and if God
[2:27] didn't come down and promis in Genesis
[2:29] 3:15 to do that God knew there was no
[2:32] man born of a man and a
[2:34] woman that could do it right cuz there
[2:37] would always be that sin part that
[2:39] separation
[2:41] between what brought you here and the
[2:44] spirit that you had or the soul that you
[2:46] have
[2:48] right but watch
[2:51] Paul in verse 42 all the way
[2:55] down he's explaining what's going to
[2:57] happen to us or what's happening to us
[3:01] but he's showing a key that verse 51
[3:04] behold I show you a mystery we shall not
[3:06] all sleep now it's like brother dick
[3:08] said Friday night we shall not all sleep
[3:12] now now Paul could say that while he was
[3:14] alive but now that Paul's dead he can't
[3:17] be we
[3:18] anymore cuz it says we which are alive
[3:20] and remain that has moved over to
[3:22] another group of people that's right
[3:25] right we shall all be changed now
[3:29] that's for real that everybody be
[3:31] changed but there's a group of people
[3:33] that's got to stand on the
[3:38] earth it's got to take a body
[3:42] change one
[3:45] day we can say all power in heaven
[3:48] Earth's been given unto us because we
[3:50] conquered
[3:51] death now down through the church ages
[3:54] that couldn't happen because when God
[3:57] was in this all and all this Jesus in
[4:00] Matthew when he
[4:03] ascended he saved that part for the end
[4:07] time because the Bible says as it was in
[4:10] the days of Noah so shall it be in the
[4:12] days of the son of man right doing all
[4:15] those evil things and all the things
[4:17] like that but there's a time comes that
[4:20] this son of God is down he come back on
[4:23] the day of Pentecost sure it was God in
[4:26] human flesh you can't deny that right
[4:30] that's why the Bible says the son of man
[4:31] was standing in the midst of the golden
[4:33] Candlestick not a son of God a son of
[4:35] man was cuz it was human beings becoming
[4:38] God in human flesh right but there was a
[4:41] time when they had to do like Paul Paul
[4:44] said in other words gleaning out of all
[4:46] this he said The Last Enemy shall be
[4:48] destroyed is death for he hath put all
[4:51] things under his
[4:52] feet come back to verse
[4:56] 27 but when he saith all things are put
[4:59] under him it is Manifest that he has
[5:01] accepted which did put all things under
[5:04] him and when all things shall be
[5:07] subdued during the church ages all
[5:10] things were not
[5:12] subdued cuz what's all the body right
[5:16] all part of it the body went down to I
[5:19] mean the the
[5:21] soul was eternal the body was still well
[5:25] they're rotting in the grave and most of
[5:27] them are dust
[5:28] now right and when all things shall be
[5:30] subdued unto him then shall the son also
[5:33] be subject all right so you and
[5:37] I have got to come to a place that
[5:40] nobody else came to and since Jesus said
[5:44] that statement in Matthew which was in
[5:46] ad about
[5:49] 33 till now
[5:54] nobody has caught the Revelation oh yeah
[5:57] they knew Jesus was God in human flesh
[6:01] the whole scripture tells you
[6:03] that but also in that they saw Paul said
[6:07] I don't see all things but I see Jesus
[6:09] he knew something had to come out of
[6:11] Jesus right Jesus Christ right all right
[6:14] something had to come from that
[6:15] man because in 51 see he catches a
[6:20] mystery and
[6:22] truly truly it was a mystery to
[6:27] Paul it might have been revealed in
[6:29] impartiality to Paul but the full
[6:32] mystery was not revealed to Paul or he
[6:33] would have took a change when he spoke
[6:35] that cuz this is the Eternal Word of God
[6:38] that's right
[6:40] okay but see as
[6:43] prophesying he's prophesying of the time
[6:46] coming that's right but we shall all be
[6:48] changed in a moment in the 20n of verse
[6:53] 52 but he's telling you in his in his um
[6:59] what what you say in his sermon or
[7:01] dissertation or whatever he was saying
[7:02] watch what he let's go back verse
[7:07] 51 here I am
[7:10] Paul all right I'm speaking to a group
[7:12] of people
[7:13] today and I'm speaking this same
[7:16] word behold I show you a
[7:19] mystery we shall not all
[7:21] sleep but we shall all be changed now
[7:24] that's a truth right M that's a truth
[7:29] right
[7:33] right
[7:36] when Paul in his own sermon by the Holy
[7:40] Ghost is bringing
[7:42] out the Revelation through Paul this is
[7:46] what's going to be kind of funny to you
[7:48] Paul spoke the Eternal Word of God right
[7:52] right this is what we're reading this is
[7:53] going to be forever settled that's right
[7:56] but what Paul was speaking he didn't
[7:58] understand
[8:01] yes I can see that right he didn't
[8:04] understand it
[8:05] all brother brandham let's go back
[8:08] brother brandom said I have to go back
[8:10] and listen to the tape that's right cuz
[8:13] I said some things that I didn't
[8:15] understand and a lot of times he'd be
[8:16] preaching and he'd say I just caught
[8:18] that or that was fresh right well guess
[8:22] what it's a man prophesying a prophet
[8:26] prophesying of a group of people now
[8:29] that's got to land on something or it's
[8:32] just Fain words right right that's right
[8:34] it's got to land on something it may not
[8:36] be for Paul may not be for brother
[8:38] Brandon but it's got to land on a group
[8:40] of
[8:41] people that literally says that's me
[8:44] right now you can all look toward that
[8:46] I'm sure Luther looked at that and said
[8:47] well that's me but there's a group of
[8:49] people that literally is going to have
[8:51] to be this made manifest but Paul in his
[8:56] preaching is showing
[8:59] cuz remember what we're going to watch
[9:01] what he
[9:04] says these three things got to happen
[9:08] before what he spoke before has to
[9:10] happen cuz when it said the last Trump
[9:13] Paul knew he wasn't the last Trump right
[9:16] he was the first truck right so he's
[9:19] saying what I'm saying is a man could
[9:20] stand up here and say
[9:22] something and it be a prophecy of a
[9:25] group of people and him actually just
[9:27] say it like he was going to walk right
[9:28] into it that's right that's right but
[9:30] listen to his
[9:32] conversation cuz what's going to happen
[9:35] but we shall all be changed comma not a
[9:38] period
[9:39] comma why he's continuing his talk in a
[9:43] moment in the twinkling of an eye and
[9:46] here's where
[9:48] Paul limited
[9:50] himself to making
[9:53] it he
[9:55] said at the last Trump
[9:59] the last
[10:01] message Paul knew he wasn't the last
[10:03] messenger remember brother Brown said he
[10:05] was trying to get the people to believe
[10:07] he preached Jesus Christ was coming back
[10:09] so real to the people they thought Jesus
[10:11] was coming right there right you know
[10:13] what brother Ryan said he said he
[10:15] preached so real he had to get them
[10:17] people to believe he wasn't talking
[10:18] about a resurrection remember there was
[10:20] people after Paul died that was
[10:21] preaching that the resurrection had
[10:23] already
[10:24] happened but he was talking about an out
[10:26] Resurrection what getting you out right
[10:29] getting you out of the world right
[10:31] that's right but Paul even limited his
[10:33] own self by what he
[10:36] spoke right at the last trunk and
[10:39] brother brandham did too cuz when
[10:41] brother brandham stood up and said he
[10:43] said if the great one is here he said
[10:44] I'm going to have to
[10:46] decrease he had to that's right he had
[10:48] to die that's right there's no way he
[10:50] could have stayed here when Christ was
[10:51] here there's no way so he limited
[10:53] himself right but see there's a group of
[10:56] people that's got so much not just words
[11:00] not just words in our
[11:01] mouth but this made
[11:04] live so there's no way that it limits
[11:08] this group of people that's right Luther
[11:09] could only see so much Luther wasn't in
[11:12] the last
[11:13] Trump so Paul is saying right here he's
[11:16] saying the last
[11:18] Trump for the trumpet shall sound what
[11:21] the message comes forth and then the
[11:23] message in
[11:25] you and the dead shall be raised
[11:27] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[11:30] mhm Paul has put a limit on himself and
[11:33] said it the last
[11:35] trunp for the trumpet shall sound now
[11:38] Paul was a trumpet Paul was an angel
[11:39] Paul was a messenger he wasn't the last
[11:41] one he was the first one
[11:45] right this gets back to so simple to
[11:48] where you say I can't do something you
[11:50] just limited yourself that's right I
[11:53] can't take a change all right then you
[11:54] can that's right that's right you cannot
[11:57] do it that's right I can't take the I
[11:59] can't be good enough to get the Holy
[12:01] Ghost that's exactly correct that's
[12:03] right but if you keep saying that you've
[12:05] limited yourself that's true right you
[12:08] got to look at what God said that's what
[12:10] we're doing here and that's really what
[12:11] Paul's doing Paul is speaking by
[12:13] inspiration remember Paul don't have a
[12:15] bible to read except the Old Testament
[12:17] that's true which he gleaned all this
[12:18] out of the Old
[12:20] Testament excuse me because
[12:24] really Paul is not the first to come up
[12:27] with that death is swallowed up in
[12:28] Victory
[12:30] mhm if you look in your Scofield
[12:33] bible Isaiah spoke it before he did
[12:37] let's go to Isaiah 25 well let's read
[12:38] this ver for this corruptible must put
[12:41] on incorruption now what Paul doing he's
[12:43] Paul is opening the door to show you how
[12:45] to do it but he's already shut the door
[12:48] on himself cuz he's not the last
[12:50] messenger for this corruptible must put
[12:52] on incorruption and this Mortal must put
[12:53] on immortality so when what when all
[12:56] that happens up above there this
[12:58] corruptible shall shall put on
[13:00] incorruption and this Mortal shall put
[13:02] on
[13:02] immortality
[13:04] then shall be brought to pass the saying
[13:07] that is written see we think Paul came
[13:09] up with all this like brother brandham
[13:11] coming up with theophany and logos no
[13:13] that was way before brother brandham
[13:15] scoffield wrote it in the early 1900s he
[13:17] talking about theophany and and logos
[13:20] and all Elohim all right now let's go to
[13:23] Isaiah
[13:28] 25 you got a SC your Bible you know
[13:30] where to go to Isaiah
[13:34] 258 excuse
[13:43] me Isaiah
[13:48] 258 he will swallow up death in Victory
[13:52] and the Lord God will wipe away tears
[13:53] from off our faith what he talking about
[13:55] Millennium talking about for us it's the
[13:57] U the manage supper
[14:00] see look at verse seven verse 6 and in
[14:03] this
[14:04] mountain that
[14:07] mountain right over there that
[14:10] mountain statue of a perfect man you
[14:12] can't see it on the video but statue of
[14:14] a perfect man see in that mountain in
[14:16] this mountain shall the Lord of hosts
[14:17] make all people a feast of fat thing
[14:19] verse seven and he will destroy in this
[14:21] mountain the face of the covering cast
[14:23] over all people what the carnal mind so
[14:27] Paul picks up this revelation
[14:29] it says death is swallowed up in Victory
[14:32] now go back to Paul verse 55 oh death
[14:35] where is thy sting oh grave where is thy
[14:38] Victory The Sting of death is sin and
[14:40] the strength of sin is the law but
[14:42] thanks be to God which gives us the
[14:43] victory through our Lord Jesus Christ
[14:46] now verse 55 is
[14:49] not the first time that was spoke go
[14:53] back to
[14:54] Hosea Hosea
[14:57] 13 that's going to be a Hard One to
[15:02] find somebody find it let me
[15:07] know I was going this way here it is I
[15:09] got
[15:10] it page
[15:13] 929 on here in your Scofield
[15:18] bible
[15:20] 13 verse
[15:22] 14 now look Paul picks up the Revelation
[15:26] though of Hosea
[15:30] I will Ransom them from the power of the
[15:32] Grave same thing Paul said I will redeem
[15:35] them from death oh death I will be thy
[15:38] plagues oh grave I will be thy
[15:41] destruction repentance shall be hid from
[15:44] my eyes so see Paul is Paul is bringing
[15:48] the Old Testament that's why that that
[15:52] there's power in that Old
[15:54] Testament don't do away with the Old
[15:56] Testament right that's where Paul got
[15:59] his
[15:59] writings cuz we we quote Paul oh Paul
[16:02] said Old Death words sure he said it but
[16:05] Paul was bringing it to a present day
[16:08] Revelation Hosea was a prophecy Paul was
[16:12] bringing it to where he was at and when
[16:14] he died it become a prophecy but see
[16:17] some of us are going to come through
[16:19] that and not feel the stand up it's like
[16:23] brother brandom said the prophet refers
[16:25] to the prophet before him previously
[16:27] that's exactly
[16:29] he could not Paul could not say anything
[16:31] different than what the Old Testament
[16:34] said but out of that Old Testament watch
[16:36] what he done he brought a present day
[16:39] Revelation in verse 51 52
[16:42] 53
[16:44] 54 but in 55 he reverts all the way back
[16:47] to what a prophet said in the Old
[16:50] Testament but Paul was telling them this
[16:53] is what's going to happen and this is
[16:55] the
[16:56] order and who's going to do it the word
[16:59] made flesh the son of man had to be come
[17:00] back the son of man wasn't in Paul's age
[17:03] right it was the spirit of God working
[17:05] through Paul it was a spirit of God
[17:08] working through all these people but in
[17:10] the end time and that's what we'll talk
[17:11] about next week is we'll talk about now
[17:14] bring it to really a present day truth
[17:18] that the son of man come back in power
[17:20] in the end time cuz it was promised that
[17:23] he would come back in power in the end
[17:25] time yes
[17:29] Matthew where it's where Jesus said all
[17:31] power is given unto me in heaven and in
[17:34] Earth that little word in cuz right
[17:36] after that he tells them to go ye there
[17:38] teacher so they had the holy spirit in
[17:40] them that's where he had the power in
[17:43] their body in their soul see he knew
[17:45] they didn't have nobody has power in
[17:47] their flesh if you'll look at what Paul
[17:49] was talking about if we had time maybe
[17:51] we'll back up next Sunday Paul was told
[17:53] telling them that their Earthly body was
[17:55] worthless that's right they could not
[17:58] bring God forth from that human body
[18:00] because it said an Adam all die
[18:04] right but there's an appointment of
[18:06] death that somebody's going to
[18:08] miss I've always said it's so simple I
[18:11] have an appointment with a doctor Monday
[18:14] if I miss an
[18:17] appointment that's what you got to do
[18:18] you got to miss that appointment with
[18:19] death just appointed under the man wants
[18:21] to die just miss the
[18:23] appointment then you don't what you
[18:24] don't have that that's right okay all
[18:27] right let's go
[18:29] we'll finish it up next Sunday and then
[18:30] we'll start on something something else
[18:33] you
