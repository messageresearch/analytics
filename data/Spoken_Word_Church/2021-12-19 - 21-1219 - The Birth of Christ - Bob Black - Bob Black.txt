requests for and the unspoken request be with us all forgive us of all our sins jesus name we pray amen amen good morning and god bless you good morning everything's a little bit different this morning come expecting come ready to ready to see something really really great so so glad for all the work that everybody's done to put this together the little skit that we're going to see this morning but this morning um i first of all appreciate brother john i guess he's listening in for for taking the last couple of sunday schools and uh we we had a really good time with all the brothers up and uh all the people up in irwin tennessee with brother andre and all the saints up there um we're just gonna take another little detour uh today from the book of hebrews and and if they're willing to pull that up since we have all of this and everything let's just let's just talk about the birth of christ this morning just for a little sunday school lesson and we'll read matthew chapter 1 verses 18 to 25 and and uh some some of chapter two as well you know most of the time when you if you're sitting around on on christmas day or whatever and you're telling the story of christ you you tend to read more maybe from the book of luke but matthew has some some interesting little nuggets that are not part of that story that he he adds um so you know you got to put them all together put all the all the four gospels together to kind of get the complete picture of everything that happened and so let's read in matthew chapter one it says now the birth of jesus christ was on this wise he said now this is how it happened but as his mother mary was espoused to joseph before they came together she was found with child of the holy ghost then joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privily but while he thought on these things you think about how many times the scripture talks about people thinking about that i think in hebrews chapter 11 there's like three different times that it points out that the people they they thought this is a gospel where we think about things we're not just believing haphazardly but we know what we believe he said while while he thought on these things behold the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a dream saying joseph thou son of david fear not to take unto thee mary thou wife for that which is conceived in her is of the holy ghost he brings out two times already that this is not just a normal birth this child is of the holy ghost and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name jesus for he shall save his people from their sins think how specific the angel was and telling him in this dream how everything even even to how he would be named now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet saying behold a virgin shall be with a child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name immanuel which being interpreted is god with us then joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the lord had bitten him and took unto him his wife and knew her not until she had brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name jesus now you notice a lot of this in verse 22 you just leave it up there and we'll just we'll just kind of just refer back to the scripture in verse 22 it says now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet so everything that's being done here you can just there's so many scriptures that will fulfill all at once all is just kind of a burst here as jesus's birth all of these scriptures so all the things that are happening are or the word being fulfilled and one of the things that's been fulfilled is that you know christ is is is kind of a he's a lamb and so we know we know that that christ wasn't really born in december it's cold outside and we know that he wasn't born this time of year he was born in the spring and it's really important to kind of to get that that that uh to have to have a perfect understanding of the picture so that when you you know you're you're studying the scripture and you're listening to brother branham and preach on why it had to be shepherds you had to be shepherds because shepherds know by sheep and those kind of things you have to know that it wasn't the the time of the year brother ramen and uh in a message he was in and we have seen a star and come to worship him he said christmas is the roman catholic conception of his birth and he said christmas has changed this the way we take christmas if you ever studied it we're taking the roman catholic church's conception of when christmas was and he goes on to talk about christ and could not have been born on the 25th day of november december and so forth and he said he talked about he came like nature nature in in the spring is when everything comes up and that's when christ was born he was born when lambs were born because he was a lamb and you see everything that's happening is to fulfill scripture right it's all it's all fulfilling scripture and verse 22 now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet and a couple of things that are being fulfilled here is in isaiah chapter 7 therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name emmanuel that that prophet isaiah spoke that many hundreds of years before and now people had wondered at that and now right before their eyes even though many in the world did not wreck it most in the world did not recognize it now god was being manifested in flesh that's maybe that's maybe the point of the christmas story what were the magi looking for christ in flesh what was the shepherds looking for christ in flesh amen and now and if you go to matthew chapter 2 scroll down to matthew chapter 2 verse 16 and we'll we're going to be scrolling up and down uh uh uh maybe a little bit or because in in verse 18 it talks about that that the fulfillment of another scripture and rama was their voice heard lamentation and weeping and great mourning rachel weeping for her children and would not be comforted because they are not and matthew says that that scripture was fulfilled when herron had all the all the kids sling he slew all the kids when the magic came and said we've been traveling for two years and so he said well let's look let's kill all the all the kids two years and under because i don't want anybody else to be king i get nervous when somebody says somebody's gonna be king so here it had all the kids slow now what what does that mean what that there's another scripture being fulfilled that's the scripture that jeremiah prophesied of in jeremiah 31 15 thus saith the lord a voice was heard in rama lamentation and bitter weeping rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children because they were not now now to really understand that scripture you got to go back rachel died when she was giving birth to benjamin and where did she die she was about a mile outside of the city of bethlehem and she was on the way back to bethlehem when she went into labor so now there's a pit story of somebody in labor in bethlehem now we've got another story of a little woman coming into bethlehem and labor and rachel was in lamentation dying there on the side of the road and she as she was in labor and she gave birth and and so in genesis we've got a story of rachel dying giving birth on the road to bethlehem and in the midst of her suffering the midwife is trying to comfort her with the news that she's having a son you think about how all all in scripture you've got that pattern repeated of there's there's sorrow and then birth there's a there's dying and then restoration and so what's happening here is the scriptures being fulfilled and there's a there's a story of lamentation and sorrow but the savior of the world is being born now in jeremiah rachel you could say rachel was weeping as they were led out of the out of out of the city going off into babylon into captivity but they had a promise that in 70 years they would be returned they would return back because you know there's that same pattern being repeated sorrow and then hope sorrow and then birth and now in matthew's day rachel's weeping again this time over the slaughter of all the children of bethlehem but but in the midst of all that sorrow there's a child being born now you see how that echoes when john in john chapter 16 he said when a woman when a woman when she is in travail have sorrow because her hour has come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remembereth no more the anguish for joy that a man is born into the world now here we've got the man christ jesus being born in the midst of all this sorrow and so that's what it means when it says and rama rama rama was that little place right outside of bethlehem and rama was there a voice heard lamentation and weeping and great mourning rachel weeping for her children and would not be comforted because they are not so his birth was fulfilling scripture another scripture was that he had to be born in bethlehem because in micah chapter 5 it says but thou bethlehem a fraud of thou that thou be little among the thousands of judah yet out of these shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in israel and you think about in the midst of all this sorrow and turmoil that that that god was actually aligning everything so that they would they would actually wind up in in bethlehem now the romans conducted a census every five years to kind of keep track of how many people there were and so they could tax people appropriately and they called every every man and his family to go back to their place of birth so they could count everybody and make sure they had a good tally of course it was really easy with the jews because the jews were really good at keeping keeping their ancestry they kept really good records of where they came from and so that's why joseph and mary went back to bethlehem because joseph was of the house of david and so david david was from bethlehem so they went back to bethlehem because that's where his front he was from so that he could be counted so the romans could get their taxes and that that forced them to go back to bethlehem so that they were going on this long difficult journey a long journey so the scripture could be fulfilled now you think about everybody in scripture going on a long journey abraham went on a long journey ruth went on a long journey you're going on a long journey and the whole purpose is so that scripture could be fulfilled and what was the purpose of this story was to see christ manifested in flesh now brother ramsey said that it looks like a horrible thing that poor little woman in that place that she was in heavy with child and would have to take that long journey he said today we would hardly think of of putting her in an ambulance if he was ever in palestine and see where she had to come through that rugged granite boulders up through there on the back of a little mule no matter how bad it was and how cruel it seemed that was the king's orders everybody must do it young or old prepared or not prepared they had to do it anyhow you had to go back to your place of birth to your church to to the place of your your ancestors to the place of your family you had to do it we we think so many times in our life it's hard it's hard to deal with without air conditioner it's hard to do without without heating or just different conveniences of life but they they had to do it they had she had even though she was in labor getting to that time of life you you uh think about sometimes sisters in labor today it's it's hard to drive on a long journey but she had to get on the back of that little mule and brother brown said it might seem strange but it was all working together good when whenever sometimes rough spots in life hit us and we're going through a little rough time god might be working out something in your life and and he said in this sermon he said now mary mary said he was painting mary as a real optimist he's his painter is like somebody that that she was going through a rough spot but it didn't matter to her he said now joseph she said now joseph dear no matter what takes place and what the king says i am able he said that's what mary said i'm able i can set up on the little mule it's several miles up around these rocky mountains and so forth if we need if we happen to need a little help there'll be many in the journey because we're not the only family you think about that sitting here this morning there's a lot of people in the journey and we we help one another there's a lot of people on the road there was a lot of people then that that had to go back to their to their to to the city of bethlehem or wherever they were from because of what the romans had done and she said there's others that suffer the same thing we have so there's others along the road and all that grief and all that suffering was so that the word of god can be fulfilled so in matthew chapter 1 verse 18 it says now the birth of jesus christ was on this wise when as his mother mary was espoused to joseph before they came together she was found with child of the holy ghost then joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privily now you think about all the grief that that little girl had to go through all the you know just like in many ways just like a lot of the suffering and things that you go through when you're being a christian example and at your work or in walmart or wherever you go and people look at you strange where people are people were certainly looking at her strange because they didn't understand how she could have a child without with without knowing a man all that humiliation and weariness and stress and god in his providence he he married her to him he allowed her to be married to a man that wasn't just some little uh uh some little young that that was you know brother brown said that he was joseph was about 45 years old when he got married and he already had four kids so he was a man with experience in some things his wife his first wife had already died he was a widower so he married this little girl and he he wasn't he wasn't so called up and just just youth and everything he was called up and he he he was a mature man that that uh knew how to handle things new knew what to be concerned with a mature man that when they got to bethlehem he was he was thinking right about i got to find a place for this little girl to have to for my wife to have a baby and and you think about think about the uh brother brown lays out all the uh the mental uh battle that joseph went through when first you know she she told him i'm i'm gonna have a baby you think about that now that just just imagine what how these things would have played out that that he would we read it a lot of times in the bible is just a story but these are real people that went through real battles and and for him you know when she told us brother-in-law said she she must have told him joseph going with her noticed this no doubt after he was espoused to her no he found out that she was to be mother now he was a just man the bible said he was she must have told him of her innocence and she must have told him of the visit with her and the great archangel that the archangel had come to her gabriel and had visited her with these great signs that he had told her about that what was going to happen think about how joseph's reaction to that that you're going to have a child without knowing any man and an angel told you told mary is what my that that what a mind battle so joseph began he began to wonder now now if she don't have somebody to to be a shield for her she's she's going to be she's going to be stoned she's going to die so to joseph it seemed that mary was trying to get him to be her shield from all the scoffers and scorners you think about that pattern but brother brown's comparing that to the the experience that joseph's going through to almost like being a christian because before you become a christian you're not willing to be a shield for christ you're not willing to to accept all the humiliation and scorn but but after you become a christian after you get the baptism in the holy ghost you're where you're ready to let anybody say whatever because you know whom you believe you you've got you've got a revelation of what you're doing here and so in verse 20 it says while he thought on these things while he thought he was he wasn't just taking it haphazardly but he was really thinking about it while he thought on these things the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a dream saying joseph thou son of david fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife for that which is conceived in hers of the holy ghost now you know you know dreams can be a little bit dangerous because you know brother brown actually in this sermon he's laying out how how dreams you you might eat a lot of spaghetti and go to bed and get a dream and it you might dream about being drowning or flying or all kinds of things that are in symbol but notice how the angel talked to joseph it was very specific he didn't need anybody to interpret it when you have a dream when god gives you a dream that's not in symbol it's not in something where you got to go ask somebody uh what do you think this means you it's something that you can rest on this dream was very specific he told joseph how the baby was going to be born what his name was going to be he laid out everything about the scenario so brother brown said he pondered on the things it was so unusual he could hardly comprehend that how could those things be but he no doubt see now that the example that he's trying to lay out is just like the gospel people ponder is is the could this message really be true could could god have really sent a prophet in this age what what if it is true what if malachi 4 5 6 really is true and he pondered on those things he was pondering on the on this new thing for that day just as many pondered today and he said while he was studying the angel of the lord appeared to him in a dream while he was studying because he he was serious about it he got desperate he wanted to know the answer he wasn't just like to we'll put it in today's term he wasn't just watching tv but he was studying so the dream the dream settled the issue for joseph and after he had the dream he was happy to be mary's shield and brother ram said when a man can be revealed that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever nobody no matter how many creeds try to turn it back you're glad to be a shield you're happy to be a shield let them say whatever you get you got a big shield up there to knock the fiery darts off you're happy to be a shield so they got up and he he talked about how they they loaded up that little donkey and fed him an extra bunch of hay and some oats and because because you know she's pregnant she was real heavy and they loaded her up and they went down to staggering and falling and pulling over to the side to get some rest every once in a while and moving real slow because she was she was pregnant and they had to take care and they and and it began to move on down into bethlehem and he said finally it began to get dark travelers along the road much more able to travel faster and they come on by and she had to breathe the dust of the rest of them upon horses and carriages and so forth they could go over it because she had to travel real slow on the account of her condition a cruel thing to send that mother up there in that condition but i can just imagine now in the little drama as they come up to the top of the hill now you think picture that in your mind coming up to the top of the hill and you know if you look at pictures of bethlehem that they're they're not great big mountains it's just kind of little rolling hills and they come up to the top of that hill and down at the bottom of the valley you can see bethlehem as they come up and bethlehem he said bethlehem sets in kind of like a little valley on the west side of the mountain of bethlehem the mountain where the little trail comes up so you you think about them laboring in that condition coming up over the hill and it's getting dark and he said the stars began to come out the stars began to come out he said after a while he come up to the top of the hill and he began to think what will i do if i can't find a place because that baby might be born tonight she's been in pain all day so now what if that baby is to be born tonight you think about us a man that has gone through situations where we got to get our wife to the hospital real quick you got to hurry you got you you can't wait you you that baby's coming and think of him going going over the city it's getting dark and they got to find a place to stay and it wasn't a place where there was no hospitals or ambulances he's got he's got a they can't have this baby on the side of the road with all these robbers and thieves and and strange people on the on the road traveling they got to find he it's an emergency he's got to find somebody some some place to to have this child but they were looking down that valley and he looked over there and they looked as it's getting dark and it and brother he explains that he looked over there and he saw a star he had never remember seeing one so big it looks so low and it was hanging right over bethlehem he looked up and he turned and he after he helped mary up on a rock to rest a little while he turned around to see it say to say to her dear did you ever notice and he could even see its reflection in her pretty black eyes as she sat and looked saying smile and said dear isn't that strange she said joseph honey i have watched that since the sun went down i've been watching that star somehow or another i feel real strange tonight that something is fixing to happen well it's usually that way you know you have that strange feeling and she began to watch the star and joseph the little mule taking his rest breathing and they watched the star and had an odd action to it it didn't act like the rest of the stars it seemed to be restless moving it was waiting for something watching for something to happen now let's leave our little couple sitting here on this rock for a minute you you know you notice how brother brown painted that scripture that was a that was a supernatural star and and later on he compares it to the to the light that paul saw on the road on the road there when he when he fell on the dirt he compares it he compares it to all these scriptural vindications of something supernatural happening and that we're now following that same light where to see christ manifest in flesh so he said let's go in our minds and we got just a few more minutes and we'll close on this let's go in our minds and go way hundreds of miles way into the east the magi the magi we're up on a tower looking the magi were um uh the medes and the persians had had conquered uh all the way over into iraq and pakistan and iran and way over over to into the western part of india so the magi had had fallen the magi if you go read the book of daniel the book of daniel refers to them as wise men that's what magi were and magi was kind of a a a term that referred to any any wise any teacher priest physician astrologer see your interpreter of dreams augers soothsayers these were people that were concerned about the supernatural so they climbed up in their tower and they and they were every night they would look at the stars and that was their bible and they could understand the stars just like he brother brown said they would study the stars like we go to like a little a little ministers meeting or a bible study that the way that they would study the stars they were so as serious about that as we are about studying the word so when they saw something that was a little out of place or something something supernatural it caught their attention and they began to go on a two-year journey over to find out where what was going on and if we go we'll we'll close on this we'll read the matthew chapter 2 the first few verses if you could pull that up brothers when jesus was born in bethlehem of judea in the days of herod the king behold there came wise men from the east to jerusalem saying where is he that is born king of the jews for we have seen his star in the east and have come to worship him when herod the king had heard these things he was troubled in all jerusalem with him and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded of them where christ should be born and they said unto him and bethlehem of judea for thus it is written by the prophet and the musicians can go ahead and come forth and thou bethlehem and the land of judah are not the least among the princes of judah for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people israel then herod when he had brutally called the wise men inquired of them diligently diligently what time the star appeared and he sent them to bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child and when he have found him bring me word again that i may come and worship him also when they had heard the king they departed and lo the star which they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy and when they were coming to the house they saw the young child with mary his mother and fell down and worshiped him and when they had opened their treasures they presented unto him gifts gold and frankincense and murk bless you [Applause] you
