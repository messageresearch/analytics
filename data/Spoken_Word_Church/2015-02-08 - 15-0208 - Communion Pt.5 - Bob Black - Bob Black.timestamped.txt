[0:00] yeah you know what that story is really
[0:02] a story of desperation because you got a
[0:05] story of of Nebuchadnezzar who's
[0:07] desperate to I got to find a way to for
[0:11] somebody to show me this dream he was
[0:13] like if y'all don't show me this dream
[0:14] I'm going to I'm going to kill you and
[0:17] and then on the other side Daniel is
[0:20] also desperate he goes to pray and God
[0:23] show us this dream and when you get
[0:25] desperate is really when something
[0:27] happens for everybody on on the
[0:29] recording we just read Daniel chapter 2
[0:32] and last week we read Jeremiah chter 50
[0:35] which talks about um how Bale and merid
[0:39] are confounded
[0:41] U can everybody see this because we're
[0:45] going
[0:46] to go like lightning
[0:49] again through a lot of quotes and and
[0:52] you might be wondering you know we were
[0:53] talking on communion this is the the
[0:55] fifth Sunday school lesson on communion
[0:56] you might be wondering what does this
[0:58] stone that came out of the mountain have
[0:59] to do with communion you remember what
[1:01] communion is is God trying to bring us
[1:04] into a position where he can fellowship
[1:07] with us you know when you when you when
[1:09] you have a child you know you uh in the
[1:11] natural you you kind of you can you can
[1:13] fellowship with them but it's it's on a
[1:15] different level when they begin to grow
[1:17] up when when they become to an adulthood
[1:20] you can look at them eye to eye and and
[1:24] you begin to talk about things like
[1:26] taxes and and uh things of of life just
[1:30] in the natural that that you they can
[1:32] they can begin to understand things that
[1:33] they wouldn't have even begun to know
[1:36] anything about when they were a little
[1:38] child when all they were concerned about
[1:40] was Legos and things but as they grow up
[1:43] they begin to you can talk to them eye
[1:45] to ey and that's that's that's what God
[1:47] is doing to us he's he's bringing us up
[1:49] to a position where where we're in
[1:51] communion with him and and uh we can we
[1:54] have an understanding of what's going on
[1:57] and really that that's why it's such a
[1:59] blessing to live in in this day because
[2:01] in this day a prophet came to set
[2:03] everything in order so that we could
[2:05] take a body change so we could have we
[2:07] could have a total understanding of all
[2:09] the all the Mysteries that were hidden
[2:11] in and there's a quote where brother
[2:12] said in that mountain are now
[2:16] revealed and what he came to do was was
[2:18] take all these little hidden pieces that
[2:20] down through the seven Church Ages were
[2:22] were uh Kush and Nimrod and that whole
[2:25] system uh cloaked the eyes of the people
[2:28] so they couldn't understand what God is
[2:30] really trying to do but now in this this
[2:31] day God sent a prophet so God could so
[2:34] Christ can come back and cap your
[2:36] personal life and bring you to a place
[2:39] where you can take a body change amen
[2:41] because you're you're you're totally
[2:44] believ in God's word you're
[2:46] you're I I do the the will of the father
[2:49] you
[2:50] know so that's why uh all all these
[2:54] scriptures just just uh everything just
[2:57] runs together in just a beautiful story
[2:59] you got back back in in uh when they
[3:02] were building that Tower of Babel you
[3:04] got kush and Nimrod trying to set up
[3:09] this separate
[3:10] system that that uh to confound to take
[3:13] God's word and and and make it something
[3:15] where uh you're you're taking people out
[3:18] of communion with God so what they did
[3:21] when they remember that little picture
[3:22] we showed of nimrod setting up the um
[3:25] the Tower of Babel and and there he was
[3:27] down there with people falling at his
[3:28] feet and see even the never canand
[3:30] that's the first thing he did was he saw
[3:32] God manifested in in in flesh with with
[3:34] Daniel and first thing he goes I'm going
[3:35] to bow at his at his feet right cuz
[3:39] they communion is between man it's an
[3:43] individual relationship between you and
[3:45] God when you put somebody else in
[3:47] between there like Nebuchadnezzar was
[3:50] trying to do with Daniel and and Kush
[3:52] and and Nimrod were trying to do they're
[3:53] setting up this thing where it takes you
[3:55] out of communion it takes you out of the
[3:57] only way you'll know God is through his
[3:59] word and if somebody else is in the mix
[4:01] it it uh see where we're
[4:04] going declare you in Jeremiah 50 verse2
[4:07] it says declare you among the Nations
[4:09] and publish and set up a standard
[4:11] publish and conceal not say Babylon is
[4:13] taken baale a confounder is confounded
[4:15] mereda the rebel is broken in pieces her
[4:19] Idols are confounded her images are
[4:21] broken in
[4:22] pieces broken in pieces by what by that
[4:25] stone that came out of the mountain so
[4:28] that's what we're going to look at so
[4:29] let's kind of review real
[4:31] quickly brother R said real communion is
[4:33] taking the word of God we believe it
[4:36] with all our heart we see it manifested
[4:38] we see it given to us we see it
[4:39] Vindicated we feel it in our lives
[4:42] that's right that's why the life is the
[4:45] evidence you receive the word is it's
[4:48] not just saying I I agree but let let's
[4:50] see that life be made manifest amen the
[4:54] word coming into the believer his
[4:56] spiritual body is built up
[5:01] communion what we need is inoculation by
[5:03] the word of God now build up get ready
[5:05] for the inoculation and now what does
[5:07] his word do it builds up our spiritual
[5:08] body strong as we commune with him to
[5:10] resist the
[5:11] devil I'm just kind of quickly reviewing
[5:14] some of the things we read last time uh
[5:16] uh no matter how much theology you've
[5:18] got it's laying there dead I could have
[5:21] it see that's that's what those those
[5:22] the calans said they they they had a
[5:25] theological understanding of God and
[5:28] they failed to realize that God was was
[5:30] his his purpose was to come down and
[5:32] dwell with man that's why they that
[5:34] scripture one of the scriptures I just
[5:35] read in chap we just read in verse in
[5:37] chapter 2 was that they didn't
[5:39] understand that God was was was you know
[5:43] let me TR let me see if I can find that
[5:44] real
[5:52] quick ah here it is and it is a rare
[5:54] thing that the king requireth and there
[5:55] is none other that can show up before
[5:57] the king except the gods whose dwelling
[5:59] is not with flesh now Daniel God had
[6:02] come down to speak through Daniel in
[6:04] flesh and show them this Revelation they
[6:07] they failed to have an understanding
[6:08] that God well his his plan and purpose
[6:11] was to come down and reveal himself in
[6:13] the
[6:13] flesh which is what he did in Christ and
[6:16] what he's doing now in his bride is
[6:18] revealing himself in
[6:20] flesh and you can't understand that just
[6:22] by theology when the spirit comes and
[6:24] quickens that word it makes it
[6:28] alive just let's get through some of
[6:35] these there's only been one man ever
[6:37] lived on Earth that was our example and
[6:39] that was the one that died for us all
[6:41] our Lord and Savior Jesus
[6:43] Christ which is the stone and God
[6:46] blessed Noah and chapter nine God
[6:48] blessed Noah and his sons and said unto
[6:50] them be fruitful uh and multiply and
[6:52] replenish the Earth which is exactly
[6:55] what K Kush they they they want
[6:57] everybody to stay in one place make a
[6:59] little system uh Genesis 10:8 and Kush
[7:03] be n he began to be a mighty one in the
[7:07] earth and as he began to be Mighty he he
[7:10] he grew and and he started off in in
[7:13] Babel when he began became strong he he
[7:16] left out of there and begin to build
[7:19] other other countries and other uh built
[7:22] Nineveh and City rhab and
[7:26] K everything started at bab there's
[7:29] getting everybody to bow down before him
[7:31] getting everybody out of communion with
[7:33] God setting up a tower to to to reach
[7:36] all the way to heaven based on knowledge
[7:37] and a theological understanding of the
[7:39] word not being quickened by the
[7:42] spirit to separate us and and see the
[7:46] word confound means to mingle so it it
[7:50] it just you can run that all the way
[7:53] down from Genesis to Revelations that
[7:54] the devil is trying to take God's word
[7:58] and mingle it with
[8:00] with something something else you know
[8:03] mingle it with uh false interpretation
[8:05] add one word to it and so
[8:09] forth so he took us out of communion
[8:12] Genesis 11 the whole earth was of one
[8:14] language and of one
[8:16] speech as and as much Community as you
[8:18] can and they said go and let us build a
[8:20] city and a tower whose top May reach
[8:23] under heaven and let us make a name lest
[8:25] we be scattered abroad upon the face of
[8:27] the Earth and there's the three things
[8:29] that Nimrod wanted to do he wanted to
[8:31] set up a city in a
[8:34] tower set up a kingdom he wanted who's
[8:37] taught May reach under Heaven he wanted
[8:39] to set up a a religion and let us make a
[8:41] name L we be scattered a PR upon the
[8:44] face of the whole earth and then what
[8:46] did God do took them right back to his
[8:49] original plan and purpose and and uh go
[8:52] into all the world and preach the gospel
[8:53] so the Lord scattered them abroad from
[8:55] then upon the face of all the Earth
[8:57] therefore the name is the name of it
[8:59] called Babel because the Lord did there
[9:01] confound the language of all the Earth
[9:03] and from then did the Lord scatter and
[9:04] brought upon the face of the
[9:06] Earth sir now it looks like like uh
[9:10] almost like God just says all of a
[9:12] sudden I'm I'm going to scatter
[9:14] everybody but really now go back to the
[9:16] if you trace the meanings of all these
[9:19] the the names of the people Kush and
[9:20] Nimrod everything Kush was known by
[9:23] baale which means the confounder he by
[9:26] mingling false Doctrine false teachings
[9:29] with the pure word of God he started
[9:31] this whole this whole mess he's really
[9:33] the one that
[9:36] uh that caused the dispersement to
[9:40] happen and here's some quotes from
[9:42] Alexander H's two BL ons the existence
[9:44] of a soul and omnipotent deity who
[9:46] created all things seems to have been
[9:47] the universal belief and tradition
[9:49] taught men the same Notions on this
[9:51] subject which in later times have been
[9:53] adopted by all civil civilized
[9:56] Nations the gothic religion taught the
[9:58] being of a supreme god God master of the
[10:00] universe so he just saying that in the
[10:02] beginning everybody you know believed in
[10:04] one God um were they were in as much
[10:07] communion as they could and then Along
[10:08] Came kissing Deon to to take them out of
[10:12] communion uh some quotes from the church
[10:14] Ages nus was the most nus being Nimrod
[10:18] was the most ancient of Assyrian Kings
[10:20] mentioned in history being of warlike
[10:21] disposition he trained many young men
[10:24] rigorously in the ARs of War he brought
[10:26] Babylonia under him while yet there was
[10:28] no city of Babylon
[10:31] the Babylonian religion was the first to
[10:33] drift away from the faith that at one
[10:35] time all the peoples of the earth
[10:36] believed in one God Supreme Eternal
[10:38] invisible who by the word of his mouth
[10:40] spoke all things into existence and that
[10:42] in his character he was loving and good
[10:44] and
[10:46] just a war like this you can trace that
[10:49] all the way down where when you try to
[10:51] force somebody to believe uh that that's
[10:54] the wrong attitude I don't know if
[10:57] you've ever heard of sun Su but he was
[10:58] this asan General that he had this
[11:01] saying that if you can understand your
[11:03] enemy and understand yourself then you
[11:04] can win a 100 Battles so you know you
[11:07] can look at at the traits of these
[11:09] people in in Genesis and just run it all
[11:11] the way down the trait of that that that
[11:14] Pagan system and kind of understand when
[11:17] when you begin to understand what the
[11:18] devil's doing and what God's doing then
[11:21] it it gives you it kind of gives you
[11:23] power to to um to conquer to overcome
[11:29] so baale Kush the confounder remember in
[11:33] Jeremiah chapter
[11:34] 50 it says baale will be confounded so
[11:39] he was the confounder he was the one
[11:40] that stirred everything but this stone
[11:42] that came out of the mountain is going
[11:43] to destroy everything that he set up so
[11:47] the confounder becomes confounded a't
[11:49] that beautiful that God just turns it
[11:52] around it is seen from this that bbell
[11:54] or chush the father of nimrod originally
[11:56] was the ring leader that led the people
[11:57] away from the true God and encouraged
[11:59] the the people as The Interpreter of
[12:00] gods to take another form of religion he
[12:02] encouraged them to go ahead with the
[12:04] tower which his son actually built this
[12:06] encouragement is what brought the
[12:07] confusion and the division of men so
[12:09] that he was both interpreter and
[12:10] confuser now that's from the per Church
[12:13] age the church age
[12:15] book Kush was known the Pagan Antiquity
[12:18] under the very character of B A
[12:19] confounder the god of confusion and look
[12:22] at the symbol of Janice whom the
[12:23] Ancients called chaos and and Janice and
[12:26] Chaos had the symbol of club that like
[12:28] break into is take God's word and the
[12:30] people and just just scatter it you know
[12:33] destroy it that symbol is a club and the
[12:35] name of a club and CI comes from the
[12:37] very word which signifies to break in
[12:39] pieces or scatter
[12:41] abroad he who caused the confusion of
[12:43] tongues was he who broke the previously
[12:46] United Earth in pieces and Scattered the
[12:49] fragments abroad is what Alexander hop
[12:51] say BR to yes sir sorry just wanted to
[12:55] add this in real quick cuz I just came
[12:58] to realization in the street their
[13:00] street slang especially amongst rappers
[13:03] and stuff like that they call marijuana
[13:05] Kush oh
[13:07] really and uh and uh it's kind of
[13:11] interesting I just now thinking about
[13:16] that yeah the confounder
[13:21] yeah so the priest of Rome set up the so
[13:24] interpreter of description uh
[13:26] interpreted of scripture and they you
[13:28] know one of the things they did was
[13:29] preserve and teaching the great truths
[13:31] of religion they want to keep it keep it
[13:32] secret instead of you know Jesus said I
[13:35] just I declared it openly I told you
[13:37] everything in the streets but they
[13:39] couldn't understand it everything was
[13:40] was just told you know brother Brown's
[13:42] openly preached all the seals he's
[13:45] openly declared all the the Daniel 70
[13:46] weeks and everything it wasn't it wasn't
[13:48] hidden and a Babylonian Pagan symbol of
[13:51] God is the equilateral triangle which is
[13:54] so close to the true symbol which is
[13:57] that pyramid the Mountain of God God out
[13:59] of that mountain came a stone That Grew
[14:01] into a great Mountain see what it's
[14:03] doing in your lives out of that mountain
[14:05] came a stone that that he's the
[14:07] Cornerstone and The Headstone and your
[14:09] own life that Cornerstone grows into a
[14:12] mountain until it consumes all of your
[14:14] Earth that's the same thing he's going
[14:15] to do when he comes back when that that
[14:18] mountain that that comes that that City
[14:20] that comes out out of New Jerusalem is
[14:22] is Pyramid shape so you can see how that
[14:24] that theme is just repeated all through
[14:26] scripture that pyramid is the is is is
[14:29] like a
[14:31] uh it's they their interpretation of it
[14:34] was that it was it represented uh a God
[14:37] and three persons but um there's a see
[14:42] it's so close to the
[14:46] truth but see God has not separated the
[14:49] people in the classes so that the masses
[14:51] are led by a holy priesthood it is true
[14:53] that leadership must be holy but then so
[14:55] must be the whole congregation the whole
[14:58] congregation should should be spirit
[15:01] filled there is no place in the world
[15:03] where priests or ministers are such
[15:05] mediate between God and the people nor
[15:07] is there a place where they are
[15:08] separated in their worship of the
[15:12] Lord when you start like Nebuchadnezzar
[15:15] did how would we know that that
[15:17] Nebuchadnezzar that image that he made
[15:19] was an image of Daniel except for the
[15:21] prophet but that see that that that that
[15:24] idea that that Pagan thought process of
[15:27] let's put a man man up and make them
[15:30] somebody that we can worship let's
[15:32] instead of looking at Christ let's look
[15:34] at a
[15:36] man separating the ministers from the
[15:39] people and making the leaders overlords
[15:41] instead of
[15:43] servants that Spirit
[15:47] does let me kind of run through a little
[15:50] bit so we can get where we're
[15:54] going see to confound in Genesis 11:9
[15:58] because the Lord did their confound the
[15:59] language of all the
[16:01] Earth that word what what what Bale did
[16:05] was to mingle false Doctrine with the
[16:07] true word and the L in strong
[16:10] concordance to mingle to confound means
[16:13] to mix mingle
[16:18] confused so who was merid that merak is
[16:21] is the one Muk and and Jeremiah 50 and
[16:25] uh maybe kind of when you get some a
[16:27] long time go back and reread Jeremiah 50
[16:29] because that's talking about the end
[16:30] time how the that uh somebody from the
[16:32] north Russia comes down and blows away
[16:35] shoots their ARS at Babylon and and uh
[16:38] destroys them and and you know bail is
[16:44] confounded and so forth uh so I'm going
[16:48] to kind of run through this quickly and
[16:51] if anybody wants these I I put together
[16:53] a huge amount of notes so if you if
[16:55] you're interested I send it up to
[16:57] brother Joe so he can put it on us B for
[16:59] you if you want a copy of it and to go
[17:01] through in your own time and see one
[17:05] common element to nimod Muk and all his
[17:08] manifestations is the symbol of the
[17:09] snake serpent dragon n Nimrod took the
[17:12] dragon as his personal emblem the thread
[17:15] of serpent lore was evident in all am
[17:17] muk's disguises that old
[17:20] Serpent and Christ was sent to bruise
[17:23] the head of the
[17:26] serpent that's where it all started the
[17:28] serpent say it that's that was the
[17:33] problem
[17:38] so now there's that there's that image
[17:40] that we're looking at in Daniel chapter
[17:42] 2 that started off see that that Pagan
[17:45] system that started off with kushan nrod
[17:48] ran right on down through the the
[17:51] Nebuchadnezzar's Kingdom of gold all the
[17:53] way down to the modern agian you can
[17:54] tell something's happened because in in
[17:57] in that chapter we just read
[17:59] Daniel chapter 2 in the days of these 10
[18:02] Kings God's going to come and set up a
[18:04] kingdom in the days of these 10 Kings
[18:07] God comes and sends a prophet so that
[18:10] that Capstone Revelation come upon the
[18:12] bride and we would believe and and God
[18:14] could come back and set up uh you know
[18:18] that stone will grow into our into our
[18:20] Earth that stone will come back and and
[18:23] you we're getting in Daniel 70 weeks and
[18:25] some things
[18:32] now let me go back to
[18:34] this because you look at this and you
[18:37] see how how God starts his his building
[18:40] with a strong
[18:42] Foundation look the devil starts his
[18:44] with a with a head because you know
[18:48] power without character is satanic you
[18:50] want somebody to look at you you want
[18:52] starting from the from the head look
[18:54] everybody uh wanting notoriety wanting
[18:57] people to look but God starts his from a
[19:00] firm foundation not not built upon
[19:02] sinking Sands but starts it with with
[19:05] humility you know we go upstairs when we
[19:07] take after we take communion we wash
[19:10] each other's feet because you know
[19:12] remember that sermon brother brother
[19:13] Wade preached on on uh the feet being
[19:16] possession and typ in possession and
[19:19] humility and you know everywhere Abraham
[19:21] walked uh God gave him possession of the
[19:23] land and and and those things you can
[19:26] just see
[19:27] how that the
[19:29] approach is
[19:31] different and in Luke 6 4749 he's like a
[19:35] man which built an house and dig deep
[19:37] and laid the foundation on a rock and
[19:39] with the flood arose the scream beat
[19:40] vehemently upon that house and could not
[19:43] shake it so now when your when your when
[19:46] your life is built upon a revelation of
[19:49] who Jesus Christ is it all the gates of
[19:52] hell cannot Prevail against that what
[19:53] Jesus told Peter
[19:59] so here we go back to Daniel 2: 44 and
[20:02] 45 for as much as thou sawest that the
[20:04] stone was cut out of the mountain
[20:06] without hands and had him break in
[20:08] pieces the iron the brass the clay and
[20:09] the silver and the gold the great God
[20:12] hath made known to the king what shall
[20:13] come to pass Hereafter and the dream is
[20:15] certain and the
[20:17] interpretation thereof sure so there's a
[20:20] a stone that came out of the
[20:22] mountains to destroy all
[20:25] stuff all the false teaching all
[20:29] everything that was started back there
[20:32] in
[20:32] Genesis to usher in a new kingdom where
[20:36] God will have
[20:40] preeminence then notice Rome exists to
[20:42] the end because it went to the end of
[20:44] toes and he's seen mud clay and that's
[20:46] people what we're made out of and iron
[20:48] the strength of Rome run in every one of
[20:49] those Nations and Rome has strength and
[20:52] every nation under heav
[20:57] right Bible says that romanism the
[21:00] Catholic Church will swallow the world
[21:02] them to t t toes run in every Kingdom
[21:05] Under the
[21:08] earth oh there's a good quote that men
[21:11] and women groping about here in Pagan
[21:13] darkness and don't even know it because
[21:16] of those T Toes that the Roman Empire
[21:18] has has spread its influence throughout
[21:22] all the
[21:24] world now
[21:28] iron and collect so you remember I I
[21:30] know a lot of us familiar with all these
[21:32] all these quotes but in 1960 United
[21:36] Nations came together and and Kusha that
[21:38] means iron and and Eisenhower that means
[21:40] iron and kusf that means clay you got
[21:42] together and you know Kusha W this is a
[21:45] picture of him uh yelling and hollering
[21:47] I I'll Crush you to the United States
[21:50] and and
[21:52] U him with shoe yeah said he'll bu us
[21:55] for fireing shot y that's what it said
[21:58] pull off his shoe and beat the stand
[21:59] with it and everything else and there's
[22:02] your iron and Clay will not mix so
[22:04] there's there was five Eastern
[22:05] communistic countries represented in
[22:07] five Western countries Mr Kusha was the
[22:10] head of the Eastern countries Mr
[22:11] isenhower is the head of the Western
[22:14] countries but it's in the days of these
[22:16] Empires that the rock stone that was H
[22:18] out of the mountain without P smoked the
[22:20] image and the feet cut out of the
[22:22] mountain must have been a mountain of
[22:24] stone it was cut out of the Mountain of
[22:26] stone now did you notice now he switches
[22:30] over to start talking about the pyramid
[22:34] he's talking about a mountain of stone
[22:35] he talking about now we find out there
[22:37] was another one written another Bible
[22:39] talks about the Zodiac and he comes down
[22:41] to another Bible written he's talking
[22:43] about Enoch's pyramid another one place
[22:45] and that was the pyramid did you notice
[22:47] in the pyramids how it started off wide
[22:48] at the bottom like a pyramid made out of
[22:51] solid rock went right up till it got to
[22:53] the top but there never was a c put on
[22:55] the pyramid take out your if you got a
[22:57] dollar bill in your pocket take out a
[22:59] dollar bill and look on it and you'll
[23:00] find here the American seal on one side
[23:02] on the other side it's got at the bottom
[23:03] of the pyramid and above the pyramid the
[23:05] Capstone but it's a great bigy and it's
[23:07] called at the bottom of this pyramid the
[23:09] Great Seal why ain't the American Eagle
[23:11] the Great Seal that's the Seal of God
[23:15] which looks like
[23:17] that now you remember in second Peter it
[23:20] says without these virtues you can't see
[23:24] far off M the further up the mountain
[23:27] you go the more or you can see brother R
[23:30] there's a quote where he said things the
[23:32] higher up you go that the the more
[23:34] things look different like a child grow
[23:37] up you know that you could start to to
[23:39] see more things than you could when you
[23:43] were
[23:44] younger and there's that Babylonian P
[23:47] symbol p symbol of God which is so close
[23:50] and they put like we talked about last
[23:52] time they put the Greek for uh the Roman
[23:54] Catholic Church put the Greek symbols
[23:56] for I am that I am in the middle of
[23:57] there and and and it it it's real close
[24:00] but it to them it means something
[24:02] different because they're looking at it
[24:03] through theological just intellectual
[24:07] eyes that headstone is the Holy Ghost
[24:11] Christ and every one of us that's got
[24:14] that magnetism of the Holy Spirit when
[24:15] that stone strikes the image the church
[24:17] will flee to it back in the glory she'll
[24:20] be taken up at the rature of the Saints
[24:22] When She Goes Forth through that
[24:26] day the stone that was come out of the
[24:28] mountain is ready to come at any time
[24:30] and when it comes what does it do it
[24:32] does away with the Gentile age it's all
[24:34] over and God completely quits dealing
[24:36] with him let him that's filthy be filthy
[24:39] still let him that's holy be holy still
[24:41] see what does he do then he takes his
[24:42] church the Holy Ghost
[24:45] feel when that when that Capstone comes
[24:48] back here's what happen the rising of
[24:49] the Saints makes the march in the glory
[24:51] what happened at that time the coming of
[24:53] that stone up went the church into Glory
[24:55] at the Rapture cause an end of the
[24:57] Gentile dispensation God ended it up the
[24:59] coming of that
[25:01] stone remember there was a stone cut out
[25:03] of the mountain without hands come
[25:05] rolling into Babylon and tearing it down
[25:07] wherever it went and the kingdom of this
[25:09] world will fall just as certain every
[25:12] man-made kingdoms got to sink so the
[25:14] kingdom of God can take the ride away
[25:17] now now that's in the natural but what
[25:18] about the spiritual what about my life I
[25:21] I all these little kingdoms of my heart
[25:23] where you got a little denominational
[25:25] idea or an idea that
[25:27] some a message Minister told you years
[25:29] ago this that's keeping you from Full
[25:31] communion with God that all these
[25:34] kingdoms are going to be teared down are
[25:36] being torn down by God's work in you
[25:40] when that Capstone comes it's going to
[25:43] it'll destroy every every all the you
[25:46] know like in the Bible Study last night
[25:48] brother brother Dale was talking about
[25:49] how that the Holy Ghost in fire comes
[25:51] and burns out everything that's not
[25:54] right all the way up it's burning out
[25:57] and leaving behind all these virtues and
[26:00] then when this Capstone
[26:02] comes and I I'm I'm I'm kind of trying
[26:05] to lay a a foundation for brother for
[26:07] brother Wade to just come up
[26:11] me so uh every man-made Kingdom's got to
[26:16] sink so the kingdom of God can take the
[26:18] ride away every man-made organization
[26:20] will fall and crumble to the dust that
[26:22] the power of the Holy Ghost might take
[26:23] the church and Rapture it into that
[26:25] place up above the stone that was cut
[26:27] out of the mountain without hands is
[26:28] rolling in crashing down babyon moving
[26:31] right on
[26:33] over he could not bruise it with the
[26:35] problem I'm I'm I'm try
[26:39] to see that that same that
[26:43] Cornerstone is The Headstone see that's
[26:46] what's so
[26:49] beautiful what started it is going to be
[26:52] what's what what caps it off it in the
[26:56] church it was the Cornerstone in in the
[26:58] full church it was The Headstone because
[27:00] that stone is
[27:02] Christ and I believe that when it's
[27:04] coming that church WIll shape into a
[27:06] place from justification of the Luther
[27:08] and so
[27:09] on he was the lamb that Daniel saw that
[27:12] was heed out of the mountain without
[27:16] hands but the true church all over the
[27:18] world is shap down to a place that
[27:19] there's coming a Ministry among them
[27:22] just exactly like the ministry of Jesus
[27:26] Christ this Rejects Stone to the pyramid
[27:30] cut out of the mountain without what
[27:31] without hands God sent it do you see it
[27:33] the rejected one the rejected stone is
[27:35] the head the Capstone and the Very one
[27:38] that they rejected through this Gentile
[27:40] age is Christ and Christ was not cut and
[27:43] put in here as a b Son of God or some
[27:46] great dignitary in the church he's the
[27:48] Holy Spirit and the cap of the pyramid
[27:50] will be Christ up see you see
[27:55] it and here's this is this this is some
[27:58] quotes I was trying to get to so we'll
[27:59] just finish up at the last few quotes
[28:02] the word in the beginning was the word
[28:05] if if you're wondering what what was
[28:07] that mouth he was HED out of the word
[28:10] was HED out and reflected what the word
[28:12] was at the beginning him the word
[28:14] reflected in the Masterpiece in his own
[28:16] likeness God back again in his own
[28:19] likeness the word form being reflected
[28:21] in the image of a man the
[28:23] Masterpiece the perfect one no fault in
[28:26] him at all so perfect reflected the of
[28:29] the Builder himself his own image was
[28:31] reflected in his work and there's what
[28:33] the the Masterpiece sermon is about it
[28:35] yeah you got Christ on Earth that's a
[28:37] perfect reflection of the pattern in
[28:40] heaven and now in this day God's
[28:43] bringing us to a perfect reflection he's
[28:46] making us into a masterpiece in his own
[28:49] image reflected in his work God and
[28:52] Christ were one and here's another quote
[28:54] and we know that we're far from a
[28:56] masterpiece but we're looking where we
[28:58] were heed from the real Masterpiece and
[29:00] in him we trust just take us to him Lord
[29:03] grant it
[29:04] Lord so you see he has cut wants to cut
[29:07] the church out just like he did the son
[29:09] he did the bride and the groom to be his
[29:12] bride you must be part of him you got to
[29:14] be heed from the word the world cut off
[29:17] of you and just leave the word only live
[29:19] in you the great sculptor is counting on
[29:21] you willing to stand and have yourself
[29:23] shaped into the likeness of his
[29:25] requirement that his word requires you
[29:27] are asked to identify yourself in him by
[29:30] the same word to be the Masterpiece for
[29:32] the
[29:35] bride in Daniel 2 verse 35 says and the
[29:39] wind carried them away all the stuff
[29:42] that n Nimrod and Kush and
[29:44] Nebuchadnezzar and all down to the toes
[29:48] the 10 toes the wind carried them away
[29:50] that no place was found for them and the
[29:52] stone that smoked the image became a
[29:54] great mountain and filled the whole
[29:57] Earth
[29:59] now there's something to meditate on
[30:01] feel the whole earth we'll just stop
[30:03] right there
