Boyd had to say and kind of goes along with what I want to speak about tonight and for for I forget I know many people know but uh and there'll be a lot a lot of people traveling this time of the year get now it's the holiday season so uh I don't know different ones will be traveling at different times but just want to remember each one to be traveling praying for them and say God bless y'all hope y'all have a Wonder ful Thanksgiving we don't know when to get to see y'all or whatever but God bless y'all and uh just can you just continue to remember each one and uh hope youall have a wonderful time with your family and and U I was thinking about that today and you know we have a we have a real Christian holiday um you know this is this is the one that uh was instituted by one of my favorite presidents probably my favorite President was Abraham Lincoln and uh uh y'all don't know this but I was born on his 165th birthday so if you you can kind of figure out how old I am I'm not as old as he but but uh we we share the we share the same birthday so but uh you know it was a day of prayer and a day of Thanksgiving to God for all that they had went through and you know it' been Lincoln had taken office in 1861 in 1864 is when they he passed the law for a time and we've been in three years of heavy conflict in this country and uh there was a statement he made one time and it was it's always stuck stuck with me and Lincoln said in his speech one time he said when I come to the end of this just paraphrasing he said when I come to the end of this journey and I said I lay down the Reigns of power and he said if I've lost every other friend in this world he said I still have one friend and that friend's inside of me that's a testimony so thank the Lord for all of his blessings on us and just Wonderful Time of the Year and uh you know everybody tries to turn everything into commercial season and all that but it's really a time give thanks to God for all that that we have and what he's brought us through and I was uh I was thinking I had a prayer had a a praise a lady that I work with she's had a lot of issues and she finally had to have a knee replacement done we prayed and and she's uh had a lot of issues with it but uh after she got through the surgery uh two days two weeks and two days after she had her surgery she was up walking didn't have any pain she didn't have any issues and uh you know most of the time they want you to walk with a cane a lot longer than that and everything like that but she didn't have any trouble and the doctor said uh her surgeon was like I think I'm put you on a billboard cuz that was uh just uh amazing how well she's done and she's not had any trouble with it and uh just want to thank the Lord that uh you know God touches and if we just believe and bind bind with each other and just commit it to the Lord he takes care of all things use us use as doctors and all that to make everything well so thank the Lord for that and I know there's other ones and I was looking through my Bible and I put I putay prayer requests in my Bible things that people give me and I stick them in there and I got to look in it in my Bible and I found prayer requests that I know that the Lord's touched these people but I still have them in my Bible every time I I see their name in there I know what God's done for them and it's just like you know I just look at them think man you know sometimes you you wonder how where God's at or different things but you know you look in your Bible and you start looking back you start thinking about what God's done and man it's amazing where you come from and where you are today and I mean it's a it's a wonderful thing so just thank the Lord for this time of this time of the year that we get to and uh I also wanted to to say uh thanks to everybody for their for the food and and for helping Sunday it was wonderful I I really appreciate it I know everybody else has the same same uh sentiments about it but I really enjoy getting together having food and fellowship with everybody and and so it's it was a wonderful time I just want to say thank you for everybody that pitches in and helps all the ones that are behind the scenes that sometimes we don't think about kind of get overlooked but we still want to say thank you for for all that you do amen and also remember we have brother Andrew Glover with us Sunday Lord willing both services and uh Sunday school everything regular service on Sunday so uh just looking forward to that and always enjoy brother brother Andrew every time I get to fellowship with him and and really really appreciate his ministry and all that God's done through him and he's a young man been preaching probably most of his life and God's just really used him and he's really a blessing so certainly looking forward to that so uh if you have your Bibles we'll look into the book of uh Psalms chapter 23 and then we'll uh just pray and then we'll read the scripture here Heavenly Father we thank you for this day Lord that you've given us Lord this time that we come be in your house Lord and father we're just so thankful Lord for all your blessings on us father where would we be without you you and Lord as we approach this time of the year Lord for of Thanksgiving Lord it should be a time every day that we give you thanks for all that we have and all that you've done for us and father we just can't give you we can't praise you enough we can't thank you enough for all that you've done for us Lord as we look to the word tonight father we just pray that you just come and speak to each heart each one that has a need Lord the ones that'll be watching in Lord all the different needs ones that need a touch in their body father we just pray that you just be with them and touch them Lord for the ones that are not here with us tonight Lord you know each need and just pray that you just continue to bless them the ones that'll be traveling Lord over the holiday season Lord just watch over them as they travel Lord a lot of people on the road and Lord just keep all the danger away from each one Lord as uh brother Wade will be traveling and we just continue to remember him Lord just bless him and hold him up and father just watch over him as he travels and as he ministers Lord we just pray that you just anoint him mightily and just give him what he has need of and Bless the people there Lord that Lord you can speak to him and to and to the people there and father we just commit ourselves into your hand tonight Lord we just pray that you just come and help us get out of the way and Lord just minister in a special way to each one Lord we just want to say we love you and we appreciate you and we just commit all things to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen uh Psalms 23 we're just going to read the whole whole chapter 1 through6 says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake ye though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou th preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever amen God bless you tonight you be seated and we'll take a little thought tonight called a table prepared and I was looking at some things tonight and you know I appreciate what brother Boyd had to say about about the young people because um the uh the other week you know I was uh I was speaking about having having an appetite for a real true feeding on the word and having a real true appetite for the a spiritual diet you know brother Brown said that the problem was we if we have the wrong diet we end up with sin and the different problems that that the Christian goes through is because our diet's wrong just is a the natural typing the spiritual you know talking about the condition the the world's in today and all the all the food and you know they pump Everything full of chemicals and everything and you know man always thinks that he can make something better and and really he's not making anything better he just continue to make it worse and you know they're they're trying to use their intelligence to do anything and it's really just called and death and you know just continues to tear everything down and just kind of just kind of thinking in that same same line about eating and our our food and eating a spiritual diet and what God has given us and and you know I was speaking there the other week and was talking about you know getting ready to go to we was talking about getting ready to go to camp and you know preparing ourselves and you know God has something for you but you've got to be ready to receive receive it and you know um I wanted to say that we had a wonderful time at camp and I I really appreciate it and Lord willing if we get a chance we're going to go back and and help and it was it was really a blessing to me I know it was a blessing to the other ones and I'm I'm sure there's other that has testimonies but uh you know it was me and brother brother Boyd and brother Louis we got to spend some time together and it was it was really a real blessing to me and and I just been began to think about some of these things and you know the condition that that things are in and you know God has a has prepared a table you know he's prepared a meal we have something to eat and whatever we have need of God has it already for us amen and so all these things are ready and I just begin to look at some of these things and you know I I was trying to find something to to put all this in in words you know that you just you think about some of these things and this scripture come to me thou preparest the table before me in the presence of my enemies and and what what struck me about that was because I was thinking about these these young people as they as they approach this time and here they are and it's the same way with you and I as we come to church and and we have needs and we and we're looking for an answer from God but you know here he is he's bringing he's bringing forth something and it's the exact same thing is that he says he prepares a table before me in the presence of my enemies why because whatever you're looking for from God if you come in the house of God tonight and you begin to look for uh answer from God or you need something from God whatever you're looking for is what you're going to get whatever your expectation is tonight is what you're going to get and when people begin to expect something then guess what the devil's going to be there because he's here tonight to hinder you just like we was talking about to the young people you know how many times have we've seen young people come to go to a a youth camp and next thing you know you know they've had they get sick and they have go through all these different issues and you know a lot of them you know whatever it is that the devil begins to talk to them and you know he begins to create complexes and different things why because he's trying to hinder them but you know they know that God's going to do something for them and they have an expectation but the devil's going to be right there to hinder you and he said he prepares a table before me in the presence of my enemies so you know what because God's going to speak to you and he wants to deal with you and help you then that the devil's going to be there now there you know there's a couple of different ways that that people look at it when you when you study this out and you know the the whole chapter of of Psalms 23 we all we know that David's writing this as a perspective about the sheep and the shepherd and and you know one of the things that you look at when you talk about a table it also means like um a Mesa and you know in in Spanish Mesa means a table and you you know it's like the area that's that's green and the shepherd knows what's there when he brings his sheep into an area for them to feed in that area and he knows what's there and you know he makes sure that there's nothing there that's going to harm them because he wants to bring them into a place that's Lush and all you know all through the scripture here when we read you know he talks about it all out just like um the path and the journey of a of a sheep but you know there's a couple of other things that that people look at and one of them is when when he talks about bringing uh being prepared a table in the presence of of my enemies um in the in the time of the of the writing and even before that um you know they used to have the the feudal system in the in Europe and and different places where you know they had a Lord and he had all the own all the property and he had servants that worked for him and and they took care of everything and he got all the the money and and everything but you know he had a group of people that he would work for that would work for him that that took care of everything but you know they got everything that they had need of from their lord their Lord give them all their all the the things that they had need of and they worked for him and so their protection came from their lord and so from the from the feudal Lords you know he took care of everything and they worked for him and in this system um where you would he would have a a a large home he would have a banquet area and different things like that and when he said he would come and so these people would be invited into the Lord's House to eat at different times and so here's these peasants that were able to come and he says Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies well you know sometimes in those situations because you're going to feed in a place that that you could because in in other areas in the in the uh this feudal system you know you were not you were under no protection because you may been outside the walls or different places or you know you're out in the field there's no protection there but here you are able to come into the into the the Master's home and here he is where where it's all and then you could let off all the pressure you could come in and have this great feast and before you amen and here you are you know you you know you didn't have any protection or or very or whatever but here's a time where you could come in and enjoy all the great things that he has that he has laid out before you and so uh you know when you see this thing about you know in the presence of my enemies well you know they were people that still tried to uh you were still under the ability to be attacked or or whatever but you know they was still you were still in this place where he could protect you and uh one of the places that when you look at this is in in John chapter 12 here when when you look at the scripture and here you are and you think of having this having this Lord having to be able to be able to protect you and having this this place where uh even you had people that wanted that didn't like you that wanted to come against you but and the one place that comes up in the scripture that comes up is where Lazarus was with Jesus and here in John chap 12 it says then Jesus 6 days before the Passover came to Bethany where Lazarus was which had been dead whom he raised from the dead and he said and there they made him a supper and Martha served but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him now scroll down I'm not going I'm not going to read all of this but get to verse if you scroll up to verse n it says but much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there and they came not for jesus' sake only but that they might see Lazarus also whom he had raised from the dead but the chief priests consulted that they they might put Lazarus also to death because because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away and believed on Jesus so here they are here here is Lazarus his Lord and he has stepped into this home and he's eating and he's eating with Jesus but the Jews are the ones the high priests and all of them hated Lazarus because he was such a testimony to who Jesus was and had been raised from the dead and they they couldn't argue with what had taken place that they had seen Lazarus pass away because of the position that he had been ascribed they knew who he was and they knew that he'd come back to life and he sat in the midst and all these Jews began to believe on Jesus because of what he had taken place and here they are and you know here they are making this PL plot trying to get to Lazarus and you know so here he is having a prepared a table before me in the presence of my enemies being able to eat in the presence of God in the presence of all these and showing what had taken place in his life and you know here they are they're arguing you know they're plotting against him trying to get to him but they they couldn't argue with what had taken place and so here he is argue you know preparing a place in the presence of my enemies now the other place that we see in the scripture when it talks about this is um you know many times they would they would prepare a a a a meal and in the midst of a Battlefield and if you if you really want to want to show off to the enemy is just go out there and set up a a feast or a table and across from a battlefield and you're looking out across your enemy and your enemy can see you and there you are and you're looking at them and they can look at you and you spread this this Feast out and you're sitting down and you're eating well you know that shows them that you don't have any fear of them why because I I I've Got Confidence in what I've got on with me that we have the we we are strong enough that we're going to sit down and we're going to rest and we're going to enjoy these things and you're not going to do anything to us and so here they are they're sitting down in the presence of their enemies eating and just daring them to come on well come on if and and if you're going to if you if you think you're strong enough if you think you're powerful enough then come on but I'm going to enjoy what I have in the midst in the presence of the enemy right and I'm just going to sit down here I am rejoicing in this and relaxing and and so here they are they're eating and enjoying themselves and and daring the the enemy to come forth and it's the same way with you and I if we come to the house of God yeah whatever the devil brings against us and tries to stop us yet we're going to still Feast on the word of God we're still going to Feast on the good things of God we're not going to hold back just feed on what God has for you that's right and you know here in in the second this is 1 Samuel chapter 14 and you when you when you begin to eat on the on the things of God and and feed and and so we know this is uh Saul come against the Philistines and and uh Jonathan is with his son with him and we know that they be they had uh Jonathan and his armor Bearer you know that they had went out to fight against the Philistines because you know he he asked his armor Bearer you know if he was ready to if he would go with him up there and he said yes and he said well you know if they if they call for us to come down you know we're not going or you know they wait for them to come down or go up to them and you know he said you know when when they went in he said we knew that that God had given the end the Philistines into Jonathan's hand you know he went up there and he slew them and he slew the like 20 of them and they got so so afraid of what had taken place that they began to fight each other and then they began to run away from them and you know then Saul was out there trying to figure out what was going to what he was going to do to fight and realizing not realizing that Jonathan had taken this initiative this step in front of the enemy that that he would that he fought him just by himself just the two of them had went up there and it didn't take the 600 it only took two of them that actually had faith in God to defeat the enemy and put the enemy to running and so here in in 1 Samuel when when he began to began to speak of these things and it it says likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in Mount Ephraim when they heard that the Philistines fled even they also followed hard after them in the battle didn't seem like they were really uh wanting to fight kind of uh a a little bit scared of what was going to take place but so the Lord saved Israel that day and the battle passed over unto Beth Haven and the men of Israel were distressed that day for Saul had a Jour of people saying cursed be the man that eateth any food unto evening that I may avenge mine on mine enemies so none of the people tasted any food and they all came all they of the land came to a wood and there was honey upon the ground and when the people were come into the wood behold the honey dropped but no man put his hand to his mouth for the man for the people feared the oath but Jonathan heard not his father charged the people with the when he when his father charged the people with the oath therefore he put the put forth the end of his Rod that was in his hand and dipped it into the honeycomb and put it his hand to his mouth and his eyes were enlightened then answered one of the people saying thy father straightly charged the people with an oath saying cursed be the man that eateth any food this day and the people were faint then said Jonathan my father hath troubled the land sea I pray you how mine eyes have been enlightened because I tasted a little of this honey how much more if happily the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they had found for had they for had there not been now much a much greater Slaughter among the Philistines so when he began to speak that that he he didn't know know what the the oath or the word the order that Saul had given the people but when Jonathan went out there and they had fought and they had gotten tired and weary and then he went and just seen the honey that was laying before them then he when he ate the honey then it's he became enlightened or he became renewed he became energized because what had taken place because of the battle and here they are they're becoming weary in front of the enemy and and Jonathan says well look what happened his dad making making another mistake as as as Saul was not to do because you know every time he was all the time trying to instead of uh going before the Lord and asking the Lord what should what I should I do or how should I handle everything he just he just raises up in himself and he does it however he wants to and you know we know different times when he when he didn't didn't Slaughter the Kings and and they brought back the gifts and all that when they were supposed to utterly destroy everything and Saul had you know Samuel rose up and had to rebuke him for what he had done well it was the same way he was always wanted to do it the way he wanted to do it but here's here's Jonathan when he's standing there in the midst of these people he said you know if everybody had just eaten but he made this rule but he but everybody's so tired now and everybody's so faint because they've not eaten all day and here they are but all he wants to do is pursue the enemy but the thing is is we need to eat we need to we need to regain our strength or our and and everything so here's what we need to do we need to eat and here Jonathan says see my father's done this and he's troubled the people because he's not allowed them to eat and they should have ate and he said if they would have just eaten if they' had just been able to eat then he's a a greater Slaughter would had a greater Victory today if we just ate but we didn't eat because we're following just somebody's idea but it wasn't based on what God said it wasn't based on what God had told to people amen and here they are there and so he say he is troubled and it's the same way today you know how much more of a greater Victory can we have if we feed on the word of God if we continue to feed on the word of God and just continue to just eat and eat and eat and hold up know it's like well I don't have strength no don't don't say those things but whatever God says and that's what you repeat and you find it in the word of God and you begin to Feast on that and you begin to think on those things you begin to dwell on those things and what happens then it becomes into your into your psyche it becomes part of you and then when you begin to speak it then you realize and you have faith because it becomes a revelation to you then you really see these things amen and it becomes a you know a testimony to you amen but he says and so as he began to uh pass the press the battle and he talks about it um he says and the people flew upon the spool after they smoked the Philistines and dropping down to 32 says and the people flew upon the spool and took sheep and oxen and calves and slew them on the ground and the people did eat them with the blood then they told Saul saying behold the people sin against the Lord and that they eat with the blood and he said ye have transgressed roll a great Stone upon me this day and then dropping down to 42 so we see that the people he he put the people in this condition where they were able to eat but then all of a sudden when when Jonathan eats and he says you know if you eat of this you can become your eyes will be open you'll be renewed well then all of a sudden the people just turn around and just start killing the animals the slaughter to eat to get something to eat because you just got to a certain point where you're just so weak and he says what you know you've sinned against the Lord you know he's he's bringing Saul's bringing this accusation to the people and telling them what what's taking place but you know when later on when we see here in the scripture when when Saul is looking to find out why he said he went before and brought a priest in and he brought the Ark of the Covenant before him to get a answer from the Lord about going forth with the fighting the Philistines and he didn't get an answer and and we we know that when those things happen then he was like well there's something going on here that I don't know what's what the problem is and you know he they cast lots between the people and Jonathan and and Saul and they they find out that the lot falls on uh Jonathan that something's happened and he asked him he says and Saul said cast lots upon me and Jonathan my son and Jonathan was taken then Saul said to Jonathan tell me what thou Hast done and Jonathan told him said I did but taste a little honey with the end of my rod that was in my hand and lo I must die because that was the that was the statement that was made to uh by Saul to the people that you know whoever eats is was going to face death and and and Saul answered God do so and more more also for Thou shalt surely die Jonathan and the people said unto Saul shall Jonathan die who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel God forbid as the Lord liveth there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground for he hath wrought with God this day so the people rescued Jonathan that he died not then Saul went up from following the Philistines and the Philistines went to their own place so it's interesting that when all this took place nothing nothing was going the way that Saul wanted it to go but when when he when all this fell and then he was like well you're going to die because this is my this is my law this is what I made and and the people tell Saul listen Jonathan was the one that had the had the following of God and wrote this great Victory and now you're wanting to kill him because he didn't follow your rule but it didn't but you're everything that you've said so far has been has been totally wrong and hasn't helped anybody hasn't hasn't blessed anybody but here Jonathan taking the initiative to follow the lord and and raising up in faith and went forth and ate and they had this great Victory and so here it is it turns it turned Saul away where Saul just walked you know left because you know he was he was so so brought down by what had taken place and it's the same way you know many times people they get into this place where they they want to try to uh carry things and and do things but it takes God God's the one that's got to be in charge it's God that that we have to follow the leadership of the Holy Ghost and ask him and pray and and seek God's face not try to figure things out on their own because many times people try to figure the more they try to figure things out on their own the more they get them wrong that's right and it becomes just a a greater problem but you know if if we know that that you know the first thing you got to do many times when uh issues and problems arise you know when you get lost in the woods and different things like that you the first thing they tell you you know first thing you do is sit down you know don't don't just be up and running all the time and trying to figure things out you need to sit down and calm yourself and figure out where you're at and you know and and people you know they you know brother Brown talks about that in the message the GU you know he he was such a Woodsman and had all these skills and was able to do all these things and he thought he had had had the ability that that he wouldn't get lost and he could do all these things but you know even experienced people that have that's had great experience in and being in the woods and doing different things you know they still have to follow the same rules they still got to come back and follow the same rules and you know that people say you know if you get lost in the woods the first thing you need to do is then you need to sit down and and build a fire and and build shelter and and you just stay where you're at and try to figure out where you're at because the more you run in the woods and you know people get into that Indian death barch where they just trying to run themselves to to death and they they can't figure anything out and you know they get to the place where they they think that they're they're hopeless but the first thing you need to do is just sit down and just think about where you're at and and look at what you need to do why because if you stay put somebody can find you you know the scripture says be still and know that I am God then if we just stay where we're at and just wait on the Lord then then we can then we don't get into these situations where we run ourselves ragged come on because you know sometimes the devil want you know the devil wants us to be up and going and and trying to tell us oh you need to do this or that or you know trying to stir things up and we we get so worked up and it's like no I'm not listening to that I'm listening to the Lord so I'm going to sit down and listen amen as many times as brother Dale always said you know be at a place you know at a place waiting you know you get to this place where you know you've got to this one place where I'm GNA stay right here until the Lord speaks you know I I think and I I've said this before but I I love this you know where Elijah was there and and he got down by the Brook cheriff you know and he told him he said it's not going to rain he said do won't fall nothing's going to take place until I call for it he said he said until I call for it right and then he said then at that same time that he goes by and the spirit of the Lord brings him to the brook cherith and he's sitting there and he's drinking by this Brook now the rest of the now the rest of Israel and Judea and everything they're going through a famine there's no rain there there's no do there's no nothing and everybody's in a panic because everything is drying up there's no food there's everything's dying then and they just see how hopeless it is and and everything but you know what the prophet is sitting beside a brook in the midst of no you know just out in his own little place that God has put him in and he's there and he's drinking this water and the Ravens begin to feed him food and they begin to feed him in the morning and in the evening and he's sitting there by the Brook amen and he's been he's in this place and people what why are you not doing why because this is where God wants you to be so you come into this place where you know and sometimes you know you wonder why things don't don't seem like the Lord's moving or or you don't have an answer well God God want you to just stay right there that's right i' I've said many times you know people want to know what's going on so well maybe this is your Brook cheriff this where God wants you to stay put because you know what if you stand there and you just pray and seek God when it gets time for you to move God will give you the answer he'll give you the he'll speak to you right because you know he sat beside that Brook the prophet sat beside that Brook until the brook dried up and you know the whole time that he was down there and he was being supernaturally fed by God there was a little widow woman somewhere who was down to her last meal down to down to her you know trying to hang on with her and her son and everything else was going by the wayside and seeing every all the Death and All the destruction and everything around her and yet she's waiting on just trying to hold on to that last little bit of meal that she had but you know there was a prophet that already God had already put a prophet to come by her way to give her what she had need of she didn't see that but the prophet Propet was there he already knew what her problem was he knew what her need was and it was all the answer was already there but you know what when that when the brook dried up then the prophet came to her and she was down there and she's just she's almost hopeless and and you know just down to her you know her last little bit of Sanity there and taking those two little sticks and she's ready to die she's ready to give up and here she is and in this last little minute but you know he says can you give me some water you know that's a that's a high dollar commodity at that time in the world but you know what she didn't mind giving him some water and then he says give me a little cake can you bake me a little cake well you know what she didn't mind giving giving the water but you know cuz that was very it was very scarce but she shared what she had but then all of a sudden you want what else I've got I've given you water now the other thing that I have very little of is this little bit of meal and you want it too and she's like listen I don't have I don't have anything I just got this little bit of to make a cake for me and my son that we're getting ready to die but he says listen I want you to understand if you make me one just make me a little one first he said I've got a blessing for you I want you to to know one thing that that's never your meal's never going to run out the oil's never going to run out but you just got to trust me to take this one little bit if you'll just take this one little bit then you'll can go this whole time this whole famine you'll be able and so you know she took him at his word and she made that little cake and you know what then she was blessed by that you know she never had when everybody else was in this is in this panic mode and everything else is dried up and everybody's starving to death but you know what she she always had what she had need of that's right she always had enough it always was enough it always lasted for whatever she had need of just by giving that little bit just by listening and you know it's the same way you and I you know God knows where you're at God knows what you have need of but you know we just sit down and wait on God things get bad things get worse whatever you know don't worry about it if your if your children are are are Wayward or whatever it may be you know what don't you worry about it just put faith in God because God is the one that give the word and then you just sit down and begin to Feast on the things of God whatever God said that's that's the truth amen whatever whatever God has said that that's the truth not not what what I think or what the you know what what I try to figure out that doesn't matter what God Said what he has said he what he's promised that's what is truth see we just trust in God whatever God has for us put our faith in God that's true and so here when um this is a second in second Samuel chapter n and you know when we see things that God has done for us and you know having having this table prepared for us there's a table that's prepared God has blessed us with these things and you know when we don't we don't see the things that God has for us but they're there and it comes in God's time and here and this this is the other one that that kind of you know it stays with me sometimes and you know D here's David and when when he's beginning to speak and you know you start to wonder about some of these things has went through and it says and David said is there yet any that is left of the House of Saul that I'm may show kindness for Jonathan's sake you know you think about sometimes when when here's David when he's looking back no doubt looking back over his life the things that's that's happened and what God has done for him and he begins to look back and he begin to think of these things and you know thinking about when David was was a was a fugitive and and all these things but he had somebody that loved him more than more than just about liked itself Jonathan loved him you know as as him own as his own self and you know what Jonathan done and the the love that they had for each other and and you know no doubt Jon Jonathan and David were closer than no doubt than David's own brothers were that he was closer to his own brothers that that Jonathan and him had this relationship and began to look back over his life and all the things that that had taken place and no no doubt what a wonderful relationship they had and he began to think about what what Jonathan had done for him and you know when Saul began to chase David and wanted to kill him but you know there was somebody that was always his ally was on his side that was his his friend Jonathan who always wanted to take care of him make sure that everything was okay with him and you know and after after d Saul's family and all was was killed and you know Jonathan had been killed and all of that you know been looking back over all the things that that Jonathan had done and the relationship they had and all these things you know here's David looking back and he says is there anybody left that I can bless because of Jonathan because what Jonathan done for me he said is there anybody else that I can bless can I bless somebody God's blessed me and he says he begins so he begins to search and he says and there was a there was of the House of Saul a servant whose name was Zeba and when they had called him unto the David the king said unto him art thou Zeba and he said he said thy servant is he and the King said is there not yet any of the House of Saul that I may show kindness of God unto him and Zeba said unto the king Jonathan hath yet a son which is lame on his feet and the King said unto him where is he and Zeba said unto the king behold he is in the house of mitar the son of Amel of lobar then King David sent and fetched him out of the house of mikar the son of Amel from lbar and when fth the son of Jonathan the son of Saul was come unto David he fell on his face and did reverence and David said M fth and he answered Behold thy servant and David said unto him fear not for I will surely show thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake and will restore to thee all the land of Saul thy father and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually and he bowed himself and said why is thy servant that thou should us look upon this son such a dead dog as I am then the king said then the king called is Zeus Saul's servant and said unto him I have given unto thy Master son all that pertain to salt and to all to all his house thou therefore and the sons and thy servants shal till the land for him and thou shalt bring shalt bring in the fruits that thy Master son may eat the food have food to eat but MTH thy Father's son shall eat all away at my table and now Zeba had 15 sons and 20 servants then said Zeba unto the king according to all that my Lord the king hath commanded his servant so shall thy servant do as for Miche said the king he shall eat at my table as one of the king's sons and mbth had a young son whose name was mikah and all that dwelt in the house of Zeba were servants unto mbth so mbth dwelt in Jerusalem for he did itat continually at the king's table and was lame on both his feet and so here we we see this this in this story where you know where John when David begins to look back of all these things and he began to look and see what what he had what had taken place in his life and he began to look for somebody to bless and he said is there anybody left uh from Saul's household and and from Jonathan's family and everything and he finds mbth there and and you know here's ath and you know no no doubt he was in a in a place when you when you look and and all your family is gone and and you know you're kind of an outcast and and you know because all the family's gone and and everything that you had is gone and everything and here you are in this in this lowly place and and you're lame and you know all these things have happened to you and you and you begin to look at all these things like well is is there any is there anything good coming of all this and then all of a sudden when you when you realize that your grandfather has been chasing the king all those years and trying to kill him and and was against him this whole time and now the king wants to see you then all of a sudden you know what then mfib he don't want to see David because you know what he so he's so afraid of what's going to take place because he can't see anything good out of it and he craws and he crawls out there and he says why why is your my Lord called me he said as a as a dead dog as I am why why are you calling to see me why because he sees the condition that he's in and nothing nothing has been right everything's but here's but here's David saying listen he said but your father Jonathan has been my friend has been like a brother to me he has blessed me and he said see now the blessings of the father are going to rest on the son he said now I'm blessing you because I have this opportunity to pay back what has been given to me and he said now I'm going to restore what was Souls is going to be yours and here and I want you because I can't I can't do anything for your father he's gone but I can do something for you I want you to come sit at my table I want you to eat of my bread he said you will always be at my table he said you will always have a place and when you begin to look at all the things that had been negative and all the problems that that he had faced in MTH had faed in his life and then all of a sudden the King has come to him and said listen I've got a place here in the palace for you and then and not only here but there's people that's going to be working for you that's going to be bringing these these gifts to you all the fruits of of their labors you're going to be able to eat of these things and I want you to come and and enjoy all of these things and know you know when he said how is all this why because there's been a blessing that's been applied to you and brothers and sisters it's the same way with you and I like why why did God come looking for us why because God had a blessing because you were one of his why because we were one of his when we were lost in sin and cut off and alienated from the life of God and from The Fellowship Of God then he came looking for us he always knew where we were and he always had a blessing for us but we couldn't see that we were cut off and even when we look at all these things how how can God come to me I don't I'm Unworthy of all these things but you know what he's the one that that made the promise he's the one that paid the price amen how many times we look at all the faults and failures in our lives we see all the things that have went wrong in our lives we see all the problems and and all these things and just like michef sitting there and all he can see is all the death and destruction all he can see is the lameness of his feet but you know what David didn't see that David didn't see all of the problems that he had all he saw was that he was the son all he could see was who he was by the bloodline and say I'm tell you and it's it's wonderful to know that in the back of God's mind no matter where you go and all the problems that you have in this world and all the places you want but you know what we were in the back part of God's mind we were one of his and no matter when we come to this earth and no matter how far away you get from God God knows where you are and if you're one of his he's coming to get you and he's going to bring you back into Fellowship because he has something to give you and you know so you know it's such a wonderful thing to see what God has done for us and we got a place to come and eat at the at his table you it was just it's nothing but God's grace to us we didn't Merit any of this we didn't we didn't have a we didn't have a a a right to any of this but it was by God's grace he called us to this that's righten and all God's blessings and he wants to bestow His blessings upon you but many times we get to the place just like M the shf where we wonder why are we in this condition why why why has these things happened to us but it's God speaking to us you're not ever going to be good enough for God's love you're not ever going to be good enough for God's grace because if you ever get to the place where you Merit it that it's not God's grace that's right and many times you know the the devil wants to try to to hold you back from from where God wants you to be and and you know it's like well uh you know we we we fail and and we have we have issues and all these things but you know what God's grace is greater than all that why because there's still the blood that you can put all your sins under that you can wash all that away that you know that you can come back in perfect and perfect uh fellowship with him but if you would but if you would just go that way if we just follow that that God has these great things for us that he's called us to these things and he wants you to to reach out and take these things he's speaking to us and it's so wonderful to realize what God has given us that we don't Merit it you know because if you know when when you when you think of these things and when God has giving you things and God has spoke to you then you know when when you want to give somebody something something you know when when you have something that that you want that you want to lay on somebody you want to bless somebody you know it it's one of the hardest things is trying to get somebody to believe you and and and it's even worse when you want to bless somebody you want to give somebody something especially when you see somebody in need and you know what they don't want to receive it and it's not and it's not that they don't want to receive it it's that it's that they don't they don't think they worthy enough to receive it well I don't you don't have to be if if I love you and I want to give you something then you don't have to be worthy enough to get it that's it when when you when you have your children even the you know no matter what they do and how they go and and how they whatever whatever is they do they're still your children right and you know what you correct your children and and but you know what you still want you still want the best for them you still want to give them the best you still want them to have the best why because you want to see them succeed in everything that they do but whatever it takes but you know what you've got to make them understand listen this is yours and you need to take it when didn't say you can't you can't run from this you what because you know I'm gonna follow you that's right amen why because my children are my children God give them to me well you know what the thing is as as long as they long as they're drawing breath then you know what then I'm going to be right there behind them I'm going to be right there in front of them I'm going be I'm going to be leading them and I'm going to be trying to tell them the right way to go they've got they've got to go that way they got to make their own choices but you know you got to show them the right way to go and just keep and just keep holding them up and before the Lord but just keep showing them the way you know they've got to make their they got to make their own choices but you got to teach them the right way to go and I hear this is from the message God's provided way and brother R speaking and he says now in the in the orience he said there was a a wedding there was to be a wedding take place he said what taking place the king said the time for his son's wedding and then it was the son's duty to give out the invitations and no one could come to that supper without an invitation he said I don't believe that there has ever been a man or woman that ever walked into a church or come into the presence of God without there being that they were given an invitation to this supper now you can take it or you can turn it down that's up to you he said some people go goes to church year after year and day after day Revival after Revival and still will not accept that invitation they don't mean to turn it down but they just neglect doing it and he says did you notice he said one had something to do he bought a piece of ground now there here he's speaking of Jesus giv the the parable of the supper and he's you know so each one of he when he sent out the the invitations for them to come to this supper that they had this great feast was set on for them to come come to but here they are and they said well I've I've got something to do he said I bought a piece of ground the other one had bought some ox he must go try them not like you wouldn't try the ox before you bought them you see it's just it's just an excuse and he said I know that all you ministers and so forth and businessmen and track works and so forth you know you find all those things people's got excuses I've just got to stay home tonight I can't attend the Revival just remember God said they'd do that they're turning down their invitation now let's look at it again and one he said this his wife wouldn't let him come and that's another excuse there there wouldn't be nothing stand between us and that invitation if it cost you a yoke of ox or your business or your wife or your children or anything nothing should separate us from that invitation God's called you to his Harvest field or to do something for him there should be nothing stand between you and God it must come first the invitation given out he said when the invitations were given out the excuses were was made then back they come and said they won't come now if you notice the last time that he he sent them out was to go into the hedges and the highways and byways get the lame halt blind and compel them to come in for God is determined that his table will not be set there'll be nobody there God wants his tables full the fatlings have been killed everything has been fixed and everything's ready and if you'll notice the last great message was to go was to go into the highways and byways now I like that about this little church here feeding the poor taking in the lame the halt the withered praying for the sick I read this little sign here what give me the idea and the lame shall walk it said certainly and the last calling was the last invitation was a great time to sweep across the country in Divine Healing and that was the last and we're winding up the end of that just pulling in the Loose Ends right now so how close is the coming of the Lord go into the hedges and byways bring them in compel them to come bring in the lame the halt the blind they had their healing service and so he begins to talk about you know brother BOS were talking about the healing services but he said you know he said but it was the Gospel he said but the gospel so that's the way it is about scroll on up there but Divine Healing it brings the people together then the hook is the gospel that catches the fishes for God's kingdom and so you know here's this table that's been that's been spread and you know when you when you come into this place that God has brought you into this into God's kingdom and and you're in into this and you're able to eat of this table that God has prepared for you then you know the thing is is you know you want you want to share this with everybody amen you know the one thing is as brother Dale's always said you know when you receive the New Birth when you see the Holy Ghost is the one thing you want to give everybody whether you know whether whether they'll accept it or not that's all that you know that's that's not the point the thing is is you want to invit invite everybody you want to make sure that everybody has this invitation they you know everybody knows about this invitation and it's been given to everybody that he said you know he had all this group and and brother R says that you know he was rebuking the Jews because they had been given this invitation unto the unto this coming because you know here they are looking for the Messiah to come and when the Messiah comes they don't recognize him and they don't receive him and they turn him down and he begins to rebuke them because here's this wedding that's been promised unto them this this coming this great feast that's been played out before laid out before them and here it is for them to come and they don't receive it and he says because when they turned when he turned the Jews turned him down then it was time for him to go to to the Gentiles and here they are going to turn to the Gentiles to re to bring forth this word to them and he says you know go to the highways and all wherever and make sure that they hear about this that there is this great feast and I want this thing full there's a place for you to come and sit at this table and he said well if they don't want to come he said well you compel them yes then you can continue to you want you just don't say here's your invitation you don't just leave it in the mailbox but what but what do you do you make sure that they know I want you to I want you to be a part of that I want you to come and be a part of this I've been here and I've I've enjoyed myself and I'm I'm full and I'm and I'm praising God and I'm feasting on these great things and I want you to Feast on these great things also you can't know if you're just standing on the outside looking in but I want you to come in and partake of this you know as brother brand was talking about that man that come and you know he he wanted to argue about whether God was real and and all these different things because you know he couldn't see him and he all these type things and and brother Brandon was standing there and he took that Apple you know he took a bite of it and he's like well if you're so smart tell me if the apple is sweet or sour and he was like well I don't know he said well that's right because if you never take how do you know it's not real you want to stand there and say it's not real that the days of Miracles have passed and all these things and there's no such thing as God and there's no such a thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost and all these things well how do you know if you never partake of it whether it's true or not that's right if you never partake how do you know what's real or not and so here it is when we began to speak of these things that I want you to partake of these things here's an invitation that's went out that you can receive all these things here is your invitation will you partake of this and so here they are trying to draw these people in and so it's it's the time for us to reach out and try to to reach out to each one and I I said all that to to say to say this and I've got I've got a little bit more but I'm going be finishing up here in a minute but you know all of this all of this has been laid on me and you know because you you go to you go to a youth camp and you know you're there to be a blessing to them but when you go you know some people go just to be with their friends and that's good it's good to have friends but you know there's kids that come and you don't you don't know what they're facing and here they are they come and you know what it was it was really nice to see some of the young people that were there and they were young young people that were that were there that were by themselves and they had nobody and it was it was a it was amazing thing that that you had young people walk up to people and introduce themselves and begin to speak to them why because they had a need and nobody and you know I can't I can't always Reach people but let me tell you something we don't realize that we say well I'm 17 you know what you can reach a teenager lot times easier and better than than a counselor could that here here these here these kids are and they come and you know they come from all kinds of of broken homes and or you know they're battling different things you don't know what kids are facing and sometimes it's amazing when you when you you begin to see some of these things that these kids are facing and sometimes we we don't realize it and I I I want to read I want to read this quote this is this is the this is the last one this is from the approach of God and and and know brother Brown was speaking and and he's speaking of of you know mothers and fathers well I I just want to I'm just going to read this and but you know we look at it and say well it's just mothers and fathers well you know what you know I think all of us put can put ourselves in here you know I I think you know the Paul said you know to treat all of the all the women as sisters and the and the older ones as you know as as mothers and you know we we think of them as as as brothers you know we honor we honor these people and here here is in the message approach to God he's he's speaking of of job and and is thinking looking at his children and and he's seeing seeing the kind of Life they live and and you know job was so interested in what his kids were going through that you know he would offer a sacrifice for his children whether whether they had committed a sin or anything like that but you know he wanted he wanted his his children protected he wanted his children covered and it says so he took the burnt offering and made an offering for his children he sacrificed for each and every one of his children that maybe listen see maybe they had Sinn maybe they never never knew would never s around job maybe they didn't know nothing about it maybe he didn't know nothing about it but knowing that they were out there in the world alone I tell you what we need today is more good oldfashioned praying mothers and fathers for their children if we had that would be the greatest support to do away with juvenile delinquency I know of first give me an oldfashioned give me oldfashioned Mothers and and daddies who pray for their children and this is this what struck me said look look at here boy or girl this afternoon he said if you've got a mother or dad like that the Holy Spirit speaking to your heart that's your mother's prayers you're walking over the top of remember that and you'll never Prosper out Prosper at all till you turn and surrender yourself to Christ that's right now job said they may have sinned so he offered the best that he had all that he knowed because that's all the approach he had to God so he killed one lamb for his own approach he killed another one for one boy and another one for another making a burnt sacrifice for each one and to have a way of approach to God God seen the honesty and sincerity and what what struck me I I was I was reading that and you know you you see the the children the way they are and and you know we we said well you know it's Mom and Daddy and you know what but you know Brother D has said so many times you know it's it's every one of us when we dedicate a baby everyone of us are dedicating ourselves to live the life in front of that child that that child doesn't just see Mom and Daddy and aunt and uncles and everything like that but you know what every one of them ought to see Jesus Christ and each one of us that it's our responsibility to to to live a life that that's glorifies God in front of them children that they know who God is not just not just thinking that you know it's you know this one or that one no we all are responsible and and as this scripture you know they're they're looking for somebody they're looking for something real yes and you know I I had there was something that took place at at the camp and and it was it was just amazing there was a there's a a young man that was there and he had he had somebody that came it was a counselor not his counselor but he had somebody come to him and began to speak to him about his condition and began to tell him about his life he said the Lord laid it upon the counselor's heart to come talk to this young man and speak to him and what was so amazing was this young man nobody knew what he was going through nobody knew what what was in his life nobody knew what was in his heart but it LA but God laid laid something on this young this young counselor to come and speak to this young man and began to speak to him and tell him the things he had been going through and what was so amazing about that was that here's this young man struggling in life and and not coming into the place that he needs to be but God and His in his infinite wisdom and his and his mercy here he comes brings this young man that they've never met before these two had never met but all of a sudden here's this young man and and this counselor is led by the Holy Spirit to come speak to this man about his life and you know and he said nobody nobody knows these things not not not even not even his family not even his parents do these things but you know what was on the inside of but God began to speak to him to tell him listen this is where you need to be and to show you that what's what's down on the inside your thoughts of thoughts the intents of your heart and nobody else in this world knows but God knows that he lays it upon somebody's heart to come speak to you to tell tell you the things that you need to do where you're standing and and that God's mindful of you amen and so when when God begins to speak to this young man then you know you know but the the thing is is you know we we see these kids and they begin to to see that God has begin to move that God's real you know it wasn't it's not psychology when God becomes begins to speak to you and he knows the thoughts and intents of the heart when begins to speak to you on your level to the place which you need to be and when he begins to do these things then you realize that's God speaking to you that's your day of visitation and let me tell you something there's there's kids out there that have just started on this journey there's there's some out there that still hasn't hasn't surrendered their lives to God but God began to deal with them in that camp well we began to pray for the young people before we went to Camp well I want I want to admonish everybody here I I want you to not just continue to pray for them young people because when God began to stir their Waters and you know what if they've not come to that place and we going to continue to pray for them until God gets a hold of them and if they begin to walk in the in the light do God begin to walk in well you know what if they come to a place of justification then if God's going to carry them all the way to the baptism of the Holy Ghost then you know what then we're going to continue to pray for them whether we know their names but God knows them and you know what it's our job to pray it's our job to compel them we may not be able to see them or lay our hands on them or pray for them or speak to them but you know we can speak on their behalf to the father we can become their intercessor before God that God began to speak to them and whatever is in their midst and just not just our young people in our church but to all the young people I was listening to Brother John Andes the other day and you know he was he was speaking at the camp and then when he was at his home church he was speaking and you know it's not it's not just it's not just ours and theirs but you know what it's all together why because we're a body we're a body Ministry so if we begin to minister we got to minister to everybody because you know it's not my group and your group no we're all the body of Christ and we're all going to pray for all of them wherever they're at whatever they're facing then you know we're going to hold them up in prayer but I want every one of them to realize there's a place God has prepared a table in the presence of your enemies and when the devil keeps fighting you I want you to come back to the table but because God is giving you a place that you come and no matter what you're facing no matter how much you feel that you're So Unworthy or or whatever God still has a place for you to come and feed on the good things of God God has made this thing for you to come don't just stand in the background and think well I'm unworthy no God is calling you when God calls your name and he calls your number and he knows where you're at and he gives you that invitation to come they know it's the time to come don't wait we don't know how much longer we've got but we need to answer that call I know I I want to pray and you know because I've got two sons and you know what I want God to get a hold of them and there's other children in this church that are not in the place where they need to be but then you're going to continue to pray for them until God gets a hold of them and wherever they go they're still our children and wherever they went to you know what they're still our are still our inheritance they're still our possession amen that's the promise of God that our children ours and you know what then we're going to continue because not only are they my Heritage but you know what they're God's Heritage and you know what then God is going to protect them but you know what he give us the responsibility to be the ones to be the intercessors for them to show them hold the light and Shine the Light and show them the path that they should take amen why because it's it's an important job I want I want to do all that I can God has a place for us and that's what God wants us to do continue to hold them up continue to shine the light continue to compel them into this great feast God has a place for you amen well God bless you this evening let's all stand have the musicians come and just because you're 15 16 17 20 years old well don't think that you know well I you know it's going to be brother eron's job or brother Bob's job or brother Wade's job no it's your job right if if you can get if you can get on I'm I'm gonna step on some toes now hey if we can get on if we can get on if we can get on Instagram and play 20 questions and everybody knows what kind of ice cream we like and uh what our shoe size is and uh what colors we like and what we're going to do next week and you know all these kind of things then you know what we need to get on there and we need to talk about the good things of God Amen I ain't pointing no fingers no more but you know what you've got if you've got a testimony then you can share it right and I know we've not we've not had a testimony service but you know what maybe the Lord allow us to have one to have the young people give their testimony if they have one from camp but you I want I want them to to have have and and show the world what that God's real what God has done for them I was listening to brother Jason Watkins some time back and brother Jason and talking about he said now people get together he said you can argue the scripture he said you can argue these different things but he said the one thing they can argue is your experience he said because they didn't have it you did he said now they don't have to believe your experience but they can't argue with it and that's the thing if you had an experience if you know what God that God's real then you show it you share it and let us all be be more salty in this world that that people can see the things that God's real because it's so easy just to blend into the background but you know but he but Jesus said we are lights the light of the world he said a city set on the hill cannot be hid he said a light that's lit is not put under a bushel right but when it's lit it's put in a Candlestick that that light may shine all around and that's our job to show the world the light of Jesus Christ and these young people when they when they come in I I you know we had they had two baptisms at Camp had one young man come in and I I don't even know where he's from or anything about him all I know is the Lord stirred his his water so much that he told Brother Jason Mars he said I can't wait till tomorrow to get baptized it was 1:00 in the morning and they got video of it brother Jason de Mars is down there in the lake 1:00 in the morning baptizing this young man why because he was stirred by something he wasn't going to wait till next week or whatever and then we had the other young lady that got baptized Sunday that camp well God stir just continue to draw them stir their Waters whatever they have need of Lord bless them but I know some of those kids they come in you know they get a they get a brief reprieve from the world and it just lightens their load and they said well a lot of them you know they they all came up for prayer and you know Friday night on Saturday night they have a a prayer line and but on Friday night they had they had young people just come up for prayer they didn't even didn't even make a invitation or anything but they were so stirred that God moved on them so much that a lot of them just started coming up front for prayer and us they were coming and then and brother Jason was talking about some of them coming down for prayer and they were standing there and brother Jason Watkins was you know some of the brothers come down brother Jason was telling them that you know they come down and he said all all they come down
