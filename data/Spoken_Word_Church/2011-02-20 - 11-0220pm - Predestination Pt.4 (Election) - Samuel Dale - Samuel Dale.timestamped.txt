[34:11] lord jesus christ who have blessed us
[34:14] with bless us with all spiritual
[34:16] blessings in heavenly places in christ
[34:19] according as he had chosen us in him
[34:22] before the foundation of the world that
[34:24] we should be holy and without blame
[34:26] before him in love
[34:28] having predestinated
[34:31] so he must have chosen for his
[34:32] predestination
[34:37] right
[34:38] having predestinated us into the
[34:40] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[34:42] himself
[34:44] according to the good pleasure of his
[34:46] will to the praise of the glory of his
[34:48] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[34:50] into blood
[34:51] in whom we have redemption through his
[34:53] blood the forgiveness of sins according
[34:56] to the riches of his grace wherein he
[34:59] hath abounded toward us in all wisdom
[35:01] and prudence
[35:03] having made known unto us the mystery of
[35:05] his will
[35:07] according to his good pleasure which he
[35:09] has purposed in himself what to adopt us
[35:12] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[35:14] of times he might gather together in one
[35:16] all things in christ both which are in
[35:18] heaven and which are on earth even in
[35:20] him
[35:21] in whom also we have obtained an
[35:23] inheritance being predestinated
[35:25] according to the purpose of him who
[35:27] worketh all things after the council of
[35:29] his own will
[35:30] that we should be to the praise of his
[35:32] glory who first trusted in
[35:34] christ now let's go over to first peter
[35:37] if we get time to get here we'll try
[35:42] first peter 1
[35:44] peter an apostle of jesus christ to the
[35:46] stranger scattered throughout pontius
[35:49] galatia cappadocia asia and bethany
[35:52] elect according what now according to
[35:55] the foreknowledge
[35:56] of god the father
[35:58] through sanctification of the spirit
[36:00] unto obedience and sprinkling of the
[36:03] blood of jesus christ grace
[36:05] unto you and peace be multiplied you may
[36:08] be seated the lord has blessing
[36:11] to the reading of the word
[36:14] now we will get to when we have time and
[36:16] get on over
[36:18] into the
[36:20] uh
[36:23] you know the point of
[36:24] how that we were chosen in him
[36:27] and all but i'm trying to stay on
[36:30] this about for knowledge
[36:33] and predestination
[36:35] to uh you know
[36:38] to get to a place to where that we can
[36:41] get a better understanding because to me
[36:43] if you don't approach it by
[36:46] foreknowledge
[36:47] then we've got a problem
[36:49] all right i hope you caught that this
[36:51] morning
[36:52] of what we were trying to bring
[36:54] that
[36:55] election
[36:57] i mean that predestination
[36:59] would
[37:02] be after
[37:04] the foreknowledge and see that's what
[37:06] everybody wants to bring all of it down
[37:09] to some predetermining factor
[37:12] and how can you approach it when you
[37:14] know the the prophet has brought it out
[37:17] so gracious unto us
[37:19] and given us these things and
[37:22] uh you know to where we can understand
[37:24] and i was looking i don't know how many
[37:27] times he made that statement but i think
[37:29] it's about five times
[37:31] uh
[37:32] you see he made it on
[37:35] jesus arose in 1956
[37:37] uh
[37:38] made the statement predestination looks
[37:40] back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge
[37:43] looks on to destiny
[37:45] he made it there he made it in where i
[37:47] think pentecost fell 1955
[37:50] um
[37:51] 11 11.
[37:53] he made it on faith of abraham prince in
[37:55] 1956 11 18.
[37:58] he made it on
[37:59] um
[38:02] let's see book of exodus
[38:05] 1956 1006 that was just some that i
[38:09] looked back and i thought well i'll
[38:10] bring those back to you and uh you know
[38:13] remind you
[38:14] that that was what he was saying
[38:17] was that
[38:19] predestination looks
[38:21] you know
[38:23] back to foreknowledge
[38:25] all right
[38:26] and then foreknowledge looks to destiny
[38:30] now
[38:31] see destiny
[38:33] is an appointed set time or position or
[38:37] whatever you want to call it that would
[38:39] be your destiny uh so you will say you
[38:41] know well you was destined to do that
[38:44] you know that means that you you you've
[38:46] done it you know the presbyterians
[38:48] brother dick said they'd say yes you was
[38:50] destined to step off of that step so
[38:53] i might as well go get step off the step
[38:55] and get it done with because you know
[38:57] i'm destined to do that and then we say
[38:59] you know especially a lot of people are
[39:01] doing about you know what well well
[39:03] you'll tell a girl you know me and
[39:04] you're destined to be married
[39:07] you know
[39:08] because you're meaning that you're
[39:10] setting a time getting a situation all
[39:12] right we'll get back to that in a minute
[39:14] but i've always said that i would never
[39:16] answer questions
[39:18] on the internet and i will not today but
[39:21] i gave you something there and i decided
[39:23] well i'd better go ahead and do it but
[39:25] when i'm questioned about where brother
[39:27] branham said it i will be glad to give
[39:30] where he said it and that's what i
[39:32] received i will not give the man's name
[39:36] because he might not want it back of
[39:37] course it's on the internet system but
[39:39] uh he might not want it on all this give
[39:41] his it's from
[39:43] um
[39:45] south africa cape town kingston
[39:49] he said greetings in the name of our
[39:50] lord and savior jesus christ what a
[39:52] privilege for me to be tuned into the
[39:54] message of the hour
[39:56] i follow every teaching of pastor dale
[39:59] and it's good to know a person that
[40:00] knows all the answers
[40:04] okay i told you i know all the answers i
[40:06] know somebody that knows all the answers
[40:08] but watch what he said he said i pray
[40:10] that god may continue to reveal his word
[40:12] unto you
[40:13] i would like to know where to find the
[40:15] quote
[40:16] that cain could be saved he called it
[40:19] your brother
[40:20] well i'll do that because that's
[40:23] in a quote or a point you've made
[40:25] you know a statement you've made and it
[40:28] is in genesis uh four
[40:30] you know six through seven where god
[40:33] tells cain you know
[40:35] you would have been set accepted had you
[40:37] done as your brother done right
[40:39] it's in the scriptures but brother
[40:41] branham i just ran these off and just
[40:43] one little bit i could find a moment ago
[40:45] but we'll read these and then they'll go
[40:47] on over to him and then you know he'll
[40:49] know what brother branham because that's
[40:51] that's not answering questions that's
[40:54] putting to the point to work
[40:55] the question where would it say that and
[40:57] i've always said if you want to know
[40:58] where i say it get something you send me
[41:01] a note and i'll be glad to tell you
[41:02] where i get it at because i get it from
[41:05] the prophet's message if not i'll just
[41:06] tell you it's my idea you know no
[41:08] problem i don't have no trouble with
[41:10] that but off the message all the days of
[41:12] our life preaching 59 6 12.
[41:17] brother brown's explaining cain and he
[41:19] literally says cain said now take it or
[41:20] leave it you know
[41:22] all right
[41:23] because that's what he said there take
[41:24] it or leave it see
[41:25] he wants his own way but god still loved
[41:28] him and he still went after him
[41:31] what did god tell cain
[41:33] you do well you'll do well if you'll
[41:36] just worship like your brother abel
[41:40] abe will come god's way but cain wanted
[41:43] his way see
[41:44] all right now in the mark of the beast
[41:46] preached in 1961-217
[41:49] brother brennan says
[41:51] talking about the worship and the things
[41:53] and all he said if that's right then
[41:54] cain was right but remember god said to
[41:57] cain worship like your brother and
[41:59] you'll do well
[42:01] but he didn't want to do it right he
[42:02] said you'll do well if you do it all
[42:04] right so above he says now that he went
[42:06] after him now here on the mark of the
[42:08] beast 61 217
[42:11] uh
[42:12] which is another paragraph e70 of the
[42:14] same message we just quoted
[42:16] when god told abel or told cain said
[42:18] just go over and worship like your
[42:20] brother
[42:21] bring a lamb come down here and worship
[42:24] like your brother says you'll do all
[42:26] right do as your brother does
[42:29] you'd be all right
[42:33] uncertain sound 1961-315
[42:37] uh
[42:38] he's talking about god told cain said he
[42:40] said go ahead and worship like your
[42:42] brother abel and you'll do well go ahead
[42:45] and do the way he's doing it'll be all
[42:47] right with you
[42:49] but he didn't sin laid at the door
[42:53] three kind of believers 63 11 24
[42:56] evening service he said god told him he
[42:59] said why don't you worship like your
[43:00] brother
[43:01] and you'll do all right you'll do well
[43:04] if you'll do that but know he know too
[43:06] much about it so he rejected it
[43:09] god's power to transform 1965 911
[43:14] he's talking about that i want to find
[43:17] this you go i got a scriptures here
[43:19] that's where i'm referring to genesis 4
[43:21] 6 and 7 then that's the scriptures
[43:24] god said to cain why why are your
[43:26] countenance falling
[43:28] why are you all full of temper walking
[43:30] around
[43:31] you just heard a message that upset you
[43:34] said well what are you doing
[43:37] that far
[43:38] why are your countenance fell
[43:40] because i didn't come into your church
[43:43] so why did you do it are you using a
[43:46] thinking man's filter
[43:48] or why didn't why you look like that he
[43:51] said if you'll do well go do like your
[43:53] brother's doing out there i'll receive
[43:56] you and bless you i'll do for you the
[43:58] same thing but he couldn't do it
[44:01] our transformation 1965 1031 the morning
[44:04] service
[44:05] he came knew the perfect will of god he
[44:08] knew the perfect will of god cain knew
[44:10] it why
[44:11] but he refused to do it he proved then
[44:13] to be the serpent's seat
[44:14] when he seen the perfect will of god he
[44:16] refused it
[44:18] he had seen god's ven god vindicate
[44:21] abel's message he know that was the will
[44:23] of god see
[44:25] you understand what he said he know what
[44:26] it was he's seen god vindicate abel's
[44:28] message
[44:29] and what did god say to him
[44:32] and he just he said do the same do
[44:36] worship like your brother and you'll do
[44:39] well
[44:40] but did he
[44:41] he seen the perfect will of god but he
[44:43] wouldn't do it so that was to that
[44:45] brother that was
[44:47] asking i'm always glad if anybody
[44:49] anything i say
[44:51] you know if you want to know where it's
[44:52] at
[44:53] like i said i'll tell you where it's at
[44:55] or i'll tell you that it's my idea
[44:58] because i have no problem doing that you
[45:00] know but if it's what he said i have no
[45:02] problem telling you what the scripture
[45:03] said and what the prophet had to say all
[45:06] right let's get back to what we were
[45:07] talking about now
[45:09] we were talking about this morning that
[45:13] predestination
[45:15] looks back
[45:17] to foreknowledge
[45:19] now i said to my to you this morning my
[45:21] own thinking in our common mind that
[45:23] doesn't seem to be
[45:25] the correct way of doing it
[45:28] because it would look like that
[45:30] you would you would try to put you know
[45:34] for knowledge out this way
[45:37] well you say well that's the way it is
[45:39] but now brother brown said
[45:41] predestination looks back to
[45:43] foreknowledge
[45:45] well that would mean that before he
[45:47] predetermined anything
[45:49] that the foreknowledge would be there
[45:51] amen
[45:53] right
[45:54] i mean that's simple reading in it it
[45:56] would be there to foreknowledge
[45:59] you say that's the mind whatever you
[46:01] want to say about it but it would go
[46:02] back to that right and now these are
[46:05] laying a foundation for
[46:07] something else about ephesians when it
[46:08] gets to where we were chosen in him
[46:11] but
[46:12] now
[46:12] see then get that point
[46:18] that you would have for knowledge
[46:20] before you would have pre predestination
[46:23] or to predetermine right then that way
[46:26] god would be correct in what he's doing
[46:28] and as we've covered this morning from
[46:30] romans dark
[46:32] that
[46:32] you know paul covering it that the thing
[46:34] for him can't say why did you form me
[46:37] this way
[46:40] because he didn't form us wrong he
[46:43] formed us correct even in a fallen
[46:45] condition now you tell me i'm not
[46:47] correct
[46:50] you tell me well i might not be able to
[46:52] find a quote where brother ryan would
[46:54] say every baby is born perfect but now
[46:56] you tell me that ain't right
[46:58] and i'll tell you you sure don't know
[47:00] your bible or your god because all life
[47:03] has to come from god
[47:06] it doesn't matter whether it's
[47:07] prostitutes or whoever has a baby life
[47:10] comes from god it don't matter if they
[47:12] take the egg out of this one the germite
[47:15] or whatever they do with it put it
[47:16] together over here
[47:18] it would still be that that would have
[47:20] to come from god
[47:22] so satan can't create science can't
[47:24] create
[47:26] they can say we can take this and we can
[47:27] find a bone and we can get dna out of
[47:30] that bone and and we can can clone a
[47:34] dinosaur you know
[47:36] well all right
[47:38] but do it without the dna
[47:43] you know
[47:44] do it without saying scraping it off of
[47:46] a bone or a rock or something
[47:49] no they can't do it see
[47:51] why because all life comes from god and
[47:53] god can't create anything imperfect
[47:56] you show me how he could
[47:59] if he created something imperfect he
[48:01] can't judge it for being imperfect
[48:03] so he created it perfect every little
[48:06] baby's perfect
[48:08] not eternal now i didn't say that
[48:11] it's perfect
[48:13] but then it's lame as i said in a
[48:15] hospital room the first thing it hears
[48:18] is the nurses over there saying well
[48:19] that's the full moon and here comes all
[48:22] these blankety blank kids
[48:24] you say well a baby don't hear that well
[48:26] maybe he has some way of knowing
[48:28] something
[48:29] right
[48:30] it knows a lot more than you think
[48:31] probably
[48:33] see if god couldn't create a soul
[48:35] imperfect i'll get to that later
[48:37] all souls
[48:40] ezekiel 18 4
[48:42] all souls are mine
[48:45] need a soul to ever come into the world
[48:47] they wouldn't soul to god
[48:50] see that's why the satan know how so
[48:52] amen that's right
[48:53] it can't be
[48:56] because you said well yeah you didn't
[48:57] always created angelic being
[49:01] not as a soul
[49:03] we'll get to it one of these days is to
[49:04] saw what in the old testament in
[49:07] bringing it out because
[49:10] you had to wait until jesus christ came
[49:12] right
[49:13] nobody could be in the kingdom in the
[49:15] old testament
[49:17] and wait to the new testament
[49:19] we'll get to those things as we go along
[49:21] but see think about it
[49:25] then us over time put ourselves in the
[49:28] pawn shop
[49:30] you know the story brought around said
[49:31] about being in the pawn shop you don't
[49:33] have to be redeemed well we put
[49:35] ourselves there god didn't put us in the
[49:37] pawn shop
[49:40] we put ourselves in the pawn shop of
[49:43] life
[49:45] we accepted to do the things
[49:49] i'm sure
[49:50] the nature of satan would come upon us
[49:53] and the prophet said
[49:55] that would motivate
[49:56] us sure
[49:59] but down inside of there was a soul
[50:02] that wanted to do right
[50:06] why because it was coming to the world
[50:08] of worship
[50:10] king
[50:11] was just the same as abel
[50:15] see now that's where they argue with you
[50:17] and say now wait just a minute well you
[50:19] show me that if god made cain any
[50:21] different then he made abel he's a
[50:23] respecter of person throw out everything
[50:26] on predestination
[50:27] right amen no
[50:31] and he offered him a change
[50:35] judas had three and a half years
[50:37] of listening to a man teach
[50:41] he had to make up his own mind
[50:44] satan entered into him
[50:46] the scripture says
[50:49] he allowed it to enter i've always told
[50:51] you
[50:52] don't worry about going and sitting down
[50:54] in the room and getting a demon on you
[50:57] unless you want it
[51:01] now brother dale i've been sitting and
[51:03] thinking yeah that's true you can feel
[51:05] spirits and things like that
[51:06] but if you don't want it it ain't going
[51:08] to get on you
[51:09] but if you want it you'll start jiggling
[51:11] with the rest of them
[51:14] right
[51:17] i know it
[51:18] brother dale gets
[51:20] his own ways but i got my own ways
[51:22] explaining it there's one thing about it
[51:24] you can't say i didn't explain it
[51:26] because you see it right even on the
[51:29] internet system
[51:31] but listen
[51:32] see then for knowledge
[51:35] then is what
[51:37] the knowledge of god
[51:40] of what would take place
[51:45] see in a later date time because in his
[51:48] foreknowledge this was back before the
[51:51] world begun
[51:53] you know this was back before there was
[51:55] a world this is back before there was
[51:57] anything molecules atoms or anything
[52:02] because the scripture tells you where
[52:04] that jesus stood as a lamb slain before
[52:06] the foundation of the world
[52:08] all right
[52:10] so then you got to go on back to there
[52:13] all right then you can see that
[52:15] um job is right when the morning starts
[52:18] saying together and the sons of god
[52:19] shouted for joy and brother brown said
[52:21] when they sing the plan of redemption
[52:26] well
[52:28] you know
[52:31] people are afraid of foreknowledge but
[52:33] you know what they're afraider of than
[52:34] for knowledge
[52:38] what do you think people are more afraid
[52:40] of than our full knowledge
[52:42] are they truly afraid of foreign
[52:44] they're afraid of knowledge
[52:49] because they cannot def have you say
[52:51] they can't
[52:52] divide the difference between the
[52:53] knowledge of god
[52:55] and the knowledge of satan right
[52:57] but they they don't want knowledge
[52:59] because knowledge on one side puff it up
[53:03] right
[53:04] but i thought it was in the statue of a
[53:06] perfect man
[53:08] right
[53:11] it's where i thought it was at listed
[53:13] all right well i now do you understand
[53:15] what i'm saying then
[53:17] that predestination the prophet said
[53:20] looks back to foreknowledge
[53:23] and then foreknowledge
[53:26] could predetermine see because you're
[53:28] coming back through see draw it out on
[53:31] your paper you know right i started
[53:32] about doing that but just look at the
[53:34] lines on your papers this morning where
[53:36] it says that predestination looks back
[53:39] to full
[53:41] and foreknowledge looks to destiny well
[53:44] all right just take that election i mean
[53:46] that
[53:47] for knowledge and bring it over here and
[53:49] then just look right back down your line
[53:50] because everything then that would be
[53:53] going forth and happening would be god's
[53:55] foreknowledge
[53:57] so the thing form can't say why didn't
[53:59] you form it so jude could say that some
[54:02] people are what
[54:04] brute beast
[54:06] made to be destroyed
[54:09] they're human beings
[54:12] you know
[54:12] see a lot of people took things like
[54:14] that and they they went around they say
[54:16] well the african people don't have a
[54:17] soul
[54:18] that's a garbage can
[54:21] no they're human beings just like we are
[54:23] everybody is
[54:25] and we all have the same opportunity
[54:28] if not god is a respecter of person
[54:32] all right now let's get down to what we
[54:34] want to get on this evening if you're
[54:36] following it like that so watch what i'm
[54:38] saying predestination looks back to four
[54:41] knowledge so you've got to move to four
[54:42] knowledge back over here past way back
[54:45] behind the predestination
[54:49] and then he can predestinate it to be
[54:51] because he's already looked through
[54:53] and seen the destiny of everything
[54:57] i don't understand why that couldn't be
[55:00] understood perfectly all right but now
[55:02] let's get one that
[55:04] has got a little different ring to it
[55:10] let's read this one
[55:13] the message ephesians parallels joshua
[55:15] 1960 515 the evening service all right
[55:18] let's read it number one on you know sir
[55:21] now listen to this
[55:24] predestination looks back to
[55:25] foreknowledge
[55:27] okay
[55:28] now watch it
[55:30] i mean election
[55:35] watching
[55:37] he changes from the word predestination
[55:40] and brings it over to election right
[55:44] all right now i'm excuse me i mean
[55:47] election
[55:48] election
[55:50] looks back to four knowledge
[55:57] and predestination
[56:01] looks to destiny
[56:04] i mean i love to read this one because i
[56:06] know what everybody thinks and they they
[56:07] want all these quotes that brother
[56:09] branham says that there was no way that
[56:11] you was a
[56:12] a
[56:13] a wolf turned into a lamb which is no
[56:16] way you as this as you know you know you
[56:18] always was
[56:20] i love to read this so this has got to
[56:23] go into where he's talking about
[56:26] all of the always was
[56:29] if he didn't say i was wrong over on
[56:31] this message back here
[56:33] it must be incorporated to see
[56:37] the whole point right
[56:38] so now watch what he said listen to this
[56:40] predestination looks back to four
[56:42] numbers i mean election election looks
[56:45] back so election
[56:47] looks back
[56:48] to for knowledge
[56:50] so anything you think about how you were
[56:52] elected in him et cetera et cetera or
[56:54] whatever you want to think whatever you
[56:56] think about your predestination being in
[56:58] him all of that whatever you want to
[57:00] think on those things you've got to back
[57:02] up to foreknowledge
[57:07] come on
[57:10] because election
[57:12] looks back
[57:14] to foreknowledge just like
[57:15] predestination
[57:17] looks back to foreknowledge
[57:19] because that's how he does it
[57:21] how did he choose
[57:24] did he choose esau and hate jacob i mean
[57:27] did he choose jacob and haydee saw
[57:33] he could only do that by his
[57:34] foreknowledge
[57:36] because if he done it by his
[57:37] predetermining
[57:39] then he couldn't say that he will that
[57:41] everybody be saved
[57:44] right
[57:45] that's scripture he wouldn't everybody
[57:48] he don't want nobody to perish
[57:50] he wants everybody to be saved so let's
[57:52] read what he has to say
[57:56] listen to this now now
[57:58] listen to this he said predestination
[57:59] looks back to four knowledge i mean
[58:01] election election looks back to four
[58:03] knowledge and predestination looks to
[58:05] destiny
[58:06] don't forget that
[58:09] that election looks back here
[58:12] here it is
[58:14] and watch then
[58:18] election is gonna have to look back
[58:22] because if it starts where you're at
[58:24] you've got a problem
[58:29] are you listening
[58:32] election looks back
[58:35] all right
[58:37] see now you wouldn't a cuckoo bird
[58:39] before the world
[58:42] right
[58:44] he wasn't nothing before the world
[58:45] that's what your prophet had to say
[58:47] about us
[58:48] he said we were only in him
[58:52] all right
[58:53] now so watch what he says
[58:55] election looks back here here it is
[58:59] i was a cockle bird
[59:01] now that's after i got here
[59:07] and he knew it yeah
[59:10] but he can't condemn me for being
[59:12] something that he makes me
[59:15] he didn't make me a kookaburra i made
[59:17] myself a cuckoo bird
[59:19] i was a cuckoo bird i was born in sin
[59:21] shaped and iniquity come to the world
[59:23] speaking lies
[59:24] born among sinners father and mother and
[59:27] all my whole family sinners
[59:30] i was a cocker bird but all of a sudden
[59:33] i became a
[59:35] wheat grain
[59:37] now how did you become a wheat grain
[59:39] i found out
[59:41] that i always was weak that's all
[59:44] right but remember you started out in
[59:48] life as a cocoa bear
[59:54] so now it became a wheatgrain
[59:56] how did it happen
[59:59] i that what is that
[1:00:01] election
[1:00:06] one talking about the grain of wheat
[1:00:08] god before the foundation of the world
[1:00:11] elected
[1:00:12] that cocker burr was to become a grain
[1:00:15] of wheat
[1:00:18] now
[1:00:19] i know i'm a grain of wheat
[1:00:22] because i'm saved
[1:00:24] how do i do it
[1:00:26] look back and see
[1:00:28] that he predestinated it
[1:00:32] long time ago
[1:00:34] before knowledge he's seen that i would
[1:00:37] love him
[1:00:38] so he made a perpetuation through his
[1:00:40] own son that through him i might become
[1:00:43] from a cocker bird to a grain of wheat
[1:00:47] now where am i at
[1:00:48] i'm saved
[1:00:50] i'm walking in the grace of god
[1:00:52] what does predestination
[1:00:54] look to destiny
[1:00:59] where will he take me to
[1:01:01] and where am i going
[1:01:03] that's got you there you are
[1:01:05] me
[1:01:09] election
[1:01:12] the scripture says
[1:01:14] to make your calling an election
[1:01:18] sure
[1:01:19] right
[1:01:21] well now make it sure
[1:01:24] you know make sure everything's all
[1:01:25] right
[1:01:26] what did we read here in a in peter
[1:01:29] elect according
[1:01:32] to the foreknowledge of god
[1:01:36] huh
[1:01:38] now everybody
[1:01:42] that's not talking about everybody
[1:01:44] that's talking to the church
[1:01:49] because
[1:01:50] everybody wasn't elected
[1:01:57] well now you're taking away no no
[1:02:00] remember
[1:02:03] remember
[1:02:05] election looks back to
[1:02:10] for knowledge
[1:02:15] now so then
[1:02:19] only the true seed is we'll get to it in
[1:02:21] a minute
[1:02:23] comes
[1:02:24] as to be called the elect
[1:02:28] okay
[1:02:30] see
[1:02:31] the rest is
[1:02:33] there's foolish virgins there's all kind
[1:02:35] of people to be given eternal life
[1:02:38] no it's just not just the elect only
[1:02:41] because brother brown said when a woman
[1:02:43] takes and lays out a material to make
[1:02:45] her a dress she cuts it out by pattern
[1:02:48] she makes her address she don't throw
[1:02:51] the rest of the material away because
[1:02:53] it's identically the same material
[1:02:56] it's just not chosen for that position
[1:02:59] why is it not chosen for that position
[1:03:05] i watched my wife make dresses and
[1:03:06] things years ago and she'd make this she
[1:03:08] even made me a suit one time you know
[1:03:10] the sports coat thing
[1:03:12] you know
[1:03:13] she would lay that pattern you know lay
[1:03:15] that down on that that pattern and she'd
[1:03:17] cut
[1:03:20] well you know she didn't take the other
[1:03:21] and just burn it you know she she put it
[1:03:24] up somewhere and made a quilt out of it
[1:03:25] because she used to do that you know
[1:03:28] and she put it together to make
[1:03:29] something else you could take parts of
[1:03:31] that and cut it up and make dish rags
[1:03:33] out of it you know wash clothes in case
[1:03:35] you don't know what a dish rag is you
[1:03:37] know
[1:03:38] washcloths
[1:03:39] you know
[1:03:41] and i know overseas they don't use a lot
[1:03:42] of worst clothes but
[1:03:44] still that's that piece of material we
[1:03:46] have over here that you wash yourself
[1:03:48] with you know
[1:03:49] you know
[1:03:50] then you dry off with a towel
[1:03:53] but
[1:03:54] see
[1:03:56] then if we're going to talk about that
[1:03:58] we're the elect
[1:04:03] we would have to talk about it on the
[1:04:06] basis
[1:04:07] that it would have to be the same
[1:04:10] as the foreknowledge
[1:04:13] you know it has to go back
[1:04:17] because predestination looks back to
[1:04:18] foreknowledge election looks back for
[1:04:21] knowledge
[1:04:22] right all right so we got to get all of
[1:04:24] it back there in the full knowledge
[1:04:28] and in that way it's not god choosing
[1:04:31] he knows our choice
[1:04:34] but i'd rather they just don't make me
[1:04:36] trill because i just i hear these
[1:04:38] brothers preaching about i was insane
[1:04:39] and i just get so excited
[1:04:47] brother around did talk about non-seed
[1:04:50] right
[1:04:52] you know what nun seed is
[1:04:58] nothing see the seed is not germanized
[1:04:59] to life
[1:05:01] right
[1:05:02] sensible in it
[1:05:04] that's non-seed
[1:05:07] all right but god does everything by
[1:05:09] foreknowledge
[1:05:11] his foreknowledge lets him look down and
[1:05:14] see everything
[1:05:17] and by seeing everything he knew the
[1:05:19] choice you would make
[1:05:22] he knew that jacob
[1:05:24] would be a shyster
[1:05:28] to get that birthright
[1:05:30] right and he'd do anything to get it
[1:05:33] i mean you think about your brother
[1:05:35] coming in i've been out you know
[1:05:37] and then he's just dying you know
[1:05:40] and back there it wouldn't be like us
[1:05:41] going off over here in the woods and and
[1:05:44] and come back about 30 minutes later and
[1:05:46] her belly's
[1:05:47] growling we say oh i'm starving to death
[1:05:51] no he probably been out there for three
[1:05:53] or four days
[1:05:56] he might have been out there a week
[1:05:57] without any food
[1:05:59] and when he came in he said i'm famous
[1:06:01] to death
[1:06:04] you know jacob says
[1:06:10] poor brother
[1:06:13] you're dying
[1:06:16] and i ain't to help you unless you give
[1:06:18] me one thing
[1:06:21] unless you give me that birth right
[1:06:27] he somehow says well i think more of
[1:06:28] living than i do what i'm going to get
[1:06:31] now everybody got a portion
[1:06:34] it was only for those with the
[1:06:36] birthright would get the double portions
[1:06:38] etc and things
[1:06:40] and he saw knew he wasn't giving up
[1:06:42] everything he was only giving up one
[1:06:44] little point
[1:06:46] and he never honored the fact or
[1:06:47] cherished the fact that he was the
[1:06:49] oldest
[1:06:52] he was interested in his own belly
[1:06:56] no
[1:06:58] how many preachers are preaching because
[1:07:00] of money
[1:07:02] in this message
[1:07:04] we don't talk about that out there
[1:07:07] because of money
[1:07:11] same ways
[1:07:14] but jacob said i want it but
[1:07:19] i'll give you the food you give me the
[1:07:21] birthright he said take it
[1:07:24] all right
[1:07:26] but listen folks
[1:07:30] god knew exactly what esau would do
[1:07:35] he knew exactly what jacob would do
[1:07:39] he knew jacob would be a shyster that
[1:07:42] he'd go up there and connie's brother
[1:07:43] ernie preaches that about you know how
[1:07:45] they have two con artists up there and
[1:07:47] uh
[1:07:48] jacob and what was the other one's name
[1:07:51] layman or something like that and they
[1:07:52] were out there conning each other
[1:07:53] because one of them would trick the
[1:07:54] other one they're other trick the other
[1:07:55] one was they just con artists but jacob
[1:07:58] didn't care
[1:08:01] he was a shyster
[1:08:05] until he got his name changed
[1:08:08] but you see god knew that he'd want to
[1:08:11] right
[1:08:12] i don't see why people can't understand
[1:08:14] salvation on that form
[1:08:17] how many times did brother branham say
[1:08:20] that god knew that you'd want to be
[1:08:21] saved so he had had it perverted
[1:08:26] well you're just over on them old
[1:08:28] doctrines it used to be
[1:08:30] uh let's see i got it probably at home
[1:08:33] and brother brown said redemption is the
[1:08:34] oldest doctrine there is
[1:08:40] the oldest doctrine in the bible is
[1:08:42] redemption
[1:08:43] when the sons of god
[1:08:45] you know shouted for joy
[1:08:48] in the plan of redemption
[1:08:52] so then
[1:08:53] i like to go back to the old doctrines
[1:08:55] and let it stay there
[1:08:57] and if i hadn't made any point on four
[1:08:59] knowledge out of four sermons now to you
[1:09:02] let it be known that brother dale
[1:09:04] believes truly in full knowledge
[1:09:07] and i believe for knowledge
[1:09:09] goes before
[1:09:11] because i proved it with the bible and
[1:09:13] proved it with the prophet's message
[1:09:15] that foreknowledge goes before
[1:09:17] predestination
[1:09:19] the election even goes before
[1:09:25] and then that way we can look at it and
[1:09:27] see
[1:09:28] and keep it in the correct order
[1:09:32] got you your choice
[1:09:35] he knew what you'd want
[1:09:37] he knew you'd want to hear this message
[1:09:40] he knew you'd want to drive all over the
[1:09:42] country to come to lula
[1:09:44] right
[1:09:45] right
[1:09:49] do you know what it would take to
[1:09:50] contact you
[1:09:52] because that's all he had to do
[1:09:55] he did not fall down on the way to
[1:09:57] damascus
[1:09:59] and force him to be saved
[1:10:06] he just knew
[1:10:09] all he had to do was meet him out there
[1:10:12] didn't you that old boy was well read
[1:10:17] and that he was a good man
[1:10:19] i believe paul was the finest man it
[1:10:21] could be probably a little hot tempered
[1:10:23] but
[1:10:24] you know
[1:10:26] but he was a good man
[1:10:28] god knew all he had to do was just meet
[1:10:30] him wrote if i said it wrong did i say
[1:10:32] damascus that where he was going
[1:10:36] see i say that a lot of times people say
[1:10:37] well you're not in the wrong place we'll
[1:10:38] put it in the right place
[1:10:40] don't hold out at me just put it in the
[1:10:42] right place you know let's work out hard
[1:10:45] but listen
[1:10:48] god knew what it would take to contact
[1:10:50] paul
[1:10:53] but as we were talking about the other
[1:10:54] day what about that
[1:10:56] pope back there
[1:11:00] that brother branham said
[1:11:02] the holy ghost tried to come on the man
[1:11:07] and he rejected it
[1:11:09] and he went and wrote the decree that it
[1:11:11] was better to force people to serve god
[1:11:13] than it was to leave him you know
[1:11:14] without forcement
[1:11:16] even to kill him
[1:11:17] right
[1:11:21] now god tried to save him
[1:11:25] so then in case you see that he would
[1:11:26] offer it to cain
[1:11:30] i don't believe judas the problem was
[1:11:32] the fact that i told you the other day
[1:11:35] peter told he did not even know anything
[1:11:37] about him at least judas introduced him
[1:11:44] he introduced him to the
[1:11:47] pilot them
[1:11:48] right
[1:11:50] huh
[1:11:51] yeah i'm not standing that far to say oh
[1:11:54] he could be see but you say judas
[1:11:56] couldn't be saved
[1:11:58] you say cain couldn't be saved
[1:12:02] well
[1:12:03] you
[1:12:05] you have your right of opinion
[1:12:08] but what about it will it fit
[1:12:12] see what if god looks at you
[1:12:15] like he did like cain
[1:12:20] hey
[1:12:22] it might be a problem mike
[1:12:25] all right
[1:12:26] trying to get a point across
[1:12:28] look at the next one i gave you from
[1:12:30] hearing acting and hearing receiving an
[1:12:32] act in 1960 um
[1:12:35] 607.
[1:12:38] but jacob
[1:12:42] his twin brothers was he talking about
[1:12:44] he talked about he's all right
[1:12:48] but jacob his twin brother
[1:12:51] by election
[1:12:54] which was by predestination
[1:12:58] before knowledge
[1:13:04] came into the world and was a spiritual
[1:13:06] man to represent the spiritual people
[1:13:12] all right
[1:13:15] so now if the bible is right
[1:13:19] i say that for your benefit not mine
[1:13:22] then the bible says gifts and callings
[1:13:24] are without repentance
[1:13:28] is that true
[1:13:31] so if jacob had any kind of a gifts or
[1:13:34] anything that you're wanting to lean
[1:13:35] upon a phone
[1:13:38] remember it would have to come before
[1:13:40] the foundation of the world
[1:13:42] for some way
[1:13:43] and give some callings would be without
[1:13:45] repentance
[1:13:48] now here's one thing god can do
[1:13:54] god can
[1:14:01] contact you
[1:14:04] right
[1:14:06] and give you a choice
[1:14:10] but remember now you've got to give
[1:14:11] everybody out some form of one
[1:14:14] at the same time
[1:14:18] but if he predestinates a seed
[1:14:22] then he's not watching you
[1:14:24] right
[1:14:29] he's watching the sea
[1:14:32] now what is the seed of god
[1:14:37] it's the word of god true
[1:14:42] god's word is his seed that was the seed
[1:14:44] disorder went to sow and all the son of
[1:14:46] man sowing the seed which is the word of
[1:14:48] god around you and said it was the law
[1:14:51] that jesus sowed
[1:14:53] can you say law that jesus sowed you
[1:14:56] know the law is not what we make it the
[1:14:58] law is spiritual but we're carnal
[1:15:02] all right
[1:15:03] and so what what happened
[1:15:08] let's just get on over to something okay
[1:15:12] look at number five on your notes where
[1:15:14] you can
[1:15:15] get to the point
[1:15:17] he said before i close this is the
[1:15:19] church egg book for page 154
[1:15:21] before i close this subject come on i
[1:15:23] know there's a question in your minds
[1:15:26] you will want to know if i believe in
[1:15:28] the doctrine of pre-existence
[1:15:31] i don't believe in that mormon doctrine
[1:15:32] of pre-existence of souls any more than
[1:15:35] i believe in reincarnation or
[1:15:37] transmigration of souls
[1:15:39] now
[1:15:41] i've faced this quote before by people
[1:15:45] that would say
[1:15:47] brother branham didn't say he didn't
[1:15:49] believe in any form of predestinat you
[1:15:52] know pre-existence
[1:15:56] i've faced that quote of many people
[1:15:57] making it
[1:15:59] you know to say see trying to try say
[1:16:01] well yeah he didn't believe in the
[1:16:03] mormon
[1:16:05] doctrine yeah
[1:16:07] we said he didn't say that believing
[1:16:08] pre-exist
[1:16:13] well
[1:16:15] i happened to know the mormon doctrine
[1:16:17] because i had a man to explain it to me
[1:16:19] where i know it because i needed it
[1:16:21] and it took him eight hours one day
[1:16:24] and the mormon doctrine of pre-existence
[1:16:27] is identical to the two soul doctrines
[1:16:29] and things and see doctrines of this
[1:16:31] message
[1:16:33] the mormon doctrine is and you heard me
[1:16:35] say it over and over but for the benefit
[1:16:37] of others
[1:16:38] that the man explained it to me that
[1:16:40] everybody was up in heaven
[1:16:43] with all up there
[1:16:47] and it come around to a point of trying
[1:16:49] to be whether or not we you know where
[1:16:51] we can glorify our father
[1:16:53] and and a plan was devised for us to
[1:16:55] come to earth
[1:16:57] and to live here in human bodies and
[1:16:59] things because we're souls
[1:17:03] and we would come to earth and live in
[1:17:05] human bodies
[1:17:07] now the problem with their doctrine on
[1:17:09] one form is it's not right but still in
[1:17:11] another they literally believed that
[1:17:13] satan had a plan to save everybody in
[1:17:15] the world
[1:17:16] now this is their doctor gnary
[1:17:18] because the man told me about it if i'm
[1:17:20] wrong let him come tell me
[1:17:24] because that's what he told me and he
[1:17:26] didn't have no reason to lie about it
[1:17:28] he said that they believed that
[1:17:30] satan come up with a plan which was the
[1:17:32] anointed churro you know come up with a
[1:17:34] plan to save everybody so jesus come up
[1:17:36] with a plan to save just some people
[1:17:40] and said then by doing that then
[1:17:43] that
[1:17:44] there was a big war in heaven
[1:17:47] and lucifer got thrown out because of
[1:17:49] his wrong doctrine well it looked like
[1:17:50] lucifer had a better doctrine than jesus
[1:17:53] but that's their doctrine all right
[1:17:55] now
[1:17:56] if that's the doctrine of pre-existence
[1:17:59] of souls
[1:18:00] then any other doctrine of pre-existence
[1:18:03] of souls would have to fit in the same
[1:18:05] category
[1:18:09] because you're talking about souls
[1:18:12] okay
[1:18:13] everybody understand
[1:18:15] you're talking about souls
[1:18:17] right so they've got the doctrine of the
[1:18:19] souls where the others would fit in the
[1:18:21] same category
[1:18:23] no brother dale we didn't believe we
[1:18:24] wanted to we didn't believe saying we
[1:18:26] didn't want it but now but you're still
[1:18:27] talking about the soul
[1:18:30] i've seen them draw it out put little
[1:18:31] dots you have to to try to prove their
[1:18:33] points and do all the things
[1:18:35] but listen to what brother brown said
[1:18:39] you see didn't believe in
[1:18:40] and i don't believe in the mormon
[1:18:42] doctrine and pre-existence of souls any
[1:18:43] more than i believe in reincarnation
[1:18:47] or transmigration of souls now
[1:18:50] the reason i can tie it together and say
[1:18:52] it's all on the soul because when you
[1:18:54] say transmigration
[1:18:56] transmigration means to go from one body
[1:19:00] to another body
[1:19:02] transmigration
[1:19:05] so he didn't believe in it coming from
[1:19:06] one body to be another body
[1:19:10] okay
[1:19:11] so that would mean throughout the whole
[1:19:13] thing all right
[1:19:15] but listen
[1:19:16] be careful here and see this it's not
[1:19:18] the person that comes predestinated
[1:19:20] eternally from god
[1:19:23] it is the word or seed
[1:19:26] that is it way back there too far too
[1:19:29] far back for the human mind to grasp
[1:19:32] the eternal god
[1:19:34] with eternal thoughts thought and decree
[1:19:37] jacob have a love but he said whatever
[1:19:39] hey
[1:19:40] he carries it back to the next and he
[1:19:42] said it's a thought
[1:19:44] all right
[1:19:46] now
[1:19:47] so it's not the person
[1:19:49] that comes predestinated eternally
[1:19:52] is to see the word
[1:19:54] all right
[1:19:56] but now every person in the world comes
[1:19:58] predestinated by foreknowledge
[1:20:02] you agree yeah
[1:20:05] god knows what everybody will do
[1:20:08] so we knew your choice you would make
[1:20:11] then as i was saying the other day then
[1:20:14] the prophet said he don't predestinate
[1:20:16] according to his desires
[1:20:18] because he desired that everybody be
[1:20:20] saved and went down and give you that
[1:20:22] back or give it on another message
[1:20:23] number six on your nose
[1:20:26] but you know what he predestinates
[1:20:27] according to your desires amen
[1:20:34] that's why people don't like foreign
[1:20:38] because foreign knowledge shows
[1:20:41] that we have the wrong desires
[1:20:44] right
[1:20:47] you know if that's what we had
[1:20:51] right this is the way i desire do you
[1:20:53] see what happened with cain
[1:20:55] came the bible and people have argued
[1:20:58] what he said there you know that cain's
[1:21:00] uh abel's offering was more excellent
[1:21:02] than cain so they said cain's offering
[1:21:05] was excellent
[1:21:07] why was it excellent when it was the
[1:21:09] fruit of the ground which was
[1:21:11] speaking of works it couldn't be see
[1:21:14] so it's not that away he's speaking and
[1:21:17] telling you that it was a good offering
[1:21:19] but it wasn't according to the revealed
[1:21:20] word
[1:21:22] all right
[1:21:23] see
[1:21:24] then
[1:21:26] why didn't god accept cain's offering
[1:21:32] but it wasn't right
[1:21:34] cain gets upset
[1:21:38] right
[1:21:40] and what does he say i read it twice a
[1:21:42] minute ago
[1:21:43] what did he say
[1:21:44] he said lord you take it or leave it
[1:21:47] in other words i'm not going to do
[1:21:48] anything else
[1:21:51] but around him i quote it till he read
[1:21:53] it to you he said he know he'd heard the
[1:21:55] message
[1:21:57] he knew the message from abel was
[1:21:59] correct because god vindicated it
[1:22:04] and he says you take it or leave it i'm
[1:22:06] not doing anything else
[1:22:13] i tied it down to god's foreknowledge
[1:22:15] didn't it
[1:22:17] so how did god elect
[1:22:21] how did he elect
[1:22:22] jacob going down reading in the quotes
[1:22:25] you got there in front of you he said he
[1:22:26] elected because jacob was seed
[1:22:35] why because jacob wanted that birth
[1:22:37] right
[1:22:41] he wanted that birth right more than
[1:22:43] anything in the world
[1:22:45] he wouldn't accurately been four days
[1:22:47] hungry
[1:22:50] he wanted that birthright
[1:22:53] and god looks down and says
[1:22:56] that being a type of the baptism of the
[1:22:58] holy ghost because that's what he wanted
[1:23:00] he's willing to give up everything to
[1:23:03] get him
[1:23:05] are we willing to give up everything to
[1:23:07] get to baptism in the holy ghost
[1:23:14] are we
[1:23:16] right now brother dale uh let's don't
[1:23:19] put it on some kind of doings now
[1:23:22] what if he asked you
[1:23:26] he asked a man one time to prove to him
[1:23:28] that he loved him
[1:23:31] to take his son up and kill him
[1:23:35] is that true
[1:23:38] murder in abraham
[1:23:43] we know we didn't do it but
[1:23:46] we know god had to stop him because he
[1:23:48] was flatly intended to do it
[1:23:51] now brother branham i thank god he put
[1:23:53] this quote in one time
[1:23:56] he said you know god does things one
[1:23:57] time for an example
[1:23:59] and said then he don't necessarily have
[1:24:01] to do it again
[1:24:03] so i'm glad he didn't put it in there to
[1:24:05] take that then we have to take her kids
[1:24:06] out and kill him
[1:24:09] we may think sometimes we'd like to but
[1:24:11] still that's
[1:24:12] beside the point
[1:24:14] you know just give them a good spanking
[1:24:15] and take care of the rest of it
[1:24:17] but
[1:24:21] predestination looks back to
[1:24:23] foreknowledge
[1:24:25] now we see election
[1:24:30] and you're elected by
[1:24:33] what did we read there elect before
[1:24:35] knowledge
[1:24:39] first peter one and two
[1:24:42] elect according to the foreknowledge of
[1:24:43] god
[1:24:45] but it goes on to show you and we'll get
[1:24:48] back to those things a little bit better
[1:24:50] true sanctification of the spirit
[1:24:51] something's gonna take place
[1:24:56] now god didn't just elect you brother
[1:24:58] dick
[1:25:00] to leave you
[1:25:02] in a presbyterian church
[1:25:05] right
[1:25:08] he knew you'd get up and leave when it
[1:25:10] come down to the situation you wanted to
[1:25:12] stay right but i wanted to stay where i
[1:25:14] was heading come on
[1:25:16] no problem
[1:25:19] but he got up and he left
[1:25:22] and god knew that
[1:25:26] all right
[1:25:27] now if the bible is right
[1:25:31] on the basis that it says he gives the
[1:25:33] holy ghost to those who obey him
[1:25:39] no
[1:25:41] then whether or not you can receive the
[1:25:43] holy ghost is not based upon whether or
[1:25:46] not you can obey him
[1:25:50] well brother i thought it was a free
[1:25:52] gift and he just throw it down in the
[1:25:54] world and just
[1:25:58] as i said about paul
[1:26:00] he slapped him off that horse he had
[1:26:03] her donkey or whatever he was writing
[1:26:05] but he didn't make him say it get saved
[1:26:09] god can't override your free moral
[1:26:11] agency
[1:26:13] that's the one thing he won't do
[1:26:17] see he knows what we'll do
[1:26:20] so that's why it says true
[1:26:22] sanctification of the spirit
[1:26:27] that means a journey that you're going
[1:26:29] to have to take brother colley it's not
[1:26:31] something just strode out
[1:26:33] that's why brother branham i gave it to
[1:26:35] you right now we reread it this morning
[1:26:38] where brother around and said its
[1:26:39] predestination is not god putting you in
[1:26:41] a tube and pushing you out the other
[1:26:43] side
[1:26:47] no
[1:26:51] he knew what we'd choose
[1:26:54] choose you this day
[1:26:56] whom he'll serve
[1:26:58] joshua's head
[1:27:00] as far as me and my house we'll serve
[1:27:02] the lord
[1:27:05] make your calling an election sure
[1:27:10] right
[1:27:11] make it according to your desired i like
[1:27:13] this one i just happened to see it
[1:27:15] you know when i was running through some
[1:27:16] things on it look what he says on number
[1:27:18] six on your notes which is super sign in
[1:27:20] 1963 11 29
[1:27:23] but remember god's clock will be just
[1:27:26] exactly on time
[1:27:28] all these things has to be this way
[1:27:31] it has to all be done according to his
[1:27:34] great for not direct knowledge
[1:27:37] he is for knowledge
[1:27:39] by or far by his foreknowledge he could
[1:27:42] predestinate
[1:27:43] not by his desire
[1:27:46] but by his foreknowledge
[1:27:48] god doesn't predestinate by his desires
[1:27:52] he's not willing that any should perish
[1:27:54] but by his foreign knowledge he knew who
[1:27:56] would accept it and who would not
[1:27:58] therefore he could make everything work
[1:28:00] according to his big clock time clock
[1:28:03] that's ticking away for he could
[1:28:05] foretell the end from the beginning
[1:28:09] now look right on down to the next one
[1:28:13] micah the prophet 61 brother random is
[1:28:16] praying
[1:28:17] or this is what he says i pray
[1:28:19] here stands abraham's seed
[1:28:22] the elected church coming out wanting to
[1:28:24] be ready to come to el shaddai to draw
[1:28:26] the strength from god for the change
[1:28:29] body to change body to receive the son
[1:28:31] when he comes
[1:28:33] i pray that you'll grant it lord
[1:28:36] to them tonight every one of them
[1:28:39] give them the desire
[1:28:41] of their heart
[1:28:45] forgive the sinner
[1:28:46] bring the backslider back
[1:28:49] take all the doubt out of the believer's
[1:28:50] heart
[1:28:52] make this a great hour
[1:28:55] give them lord
[1:28:55] desire for their heart
[1:28:59] now brother branham in preaching
[1:29:00] salvation
[1:29:02] in the scripture that said jonah 2 and 9
[1:29:04] i think it is it says salvation of the
[1:29:06] lord
[1:29:07] and brother around said you don't have
[1:29:08] anything to do with it because you
[1:29:10] didn't choose him he chose you
[1:29:14] but you do have to accept it
[1:29:18] if you don't accept it
[1:29:22] it's not a pardon true
[1:29:26] so then he wouldn't give it to you if he
[1:29:28] didn't believe he was going to accept it
[1:29:30] and he did that
[1:29:32] quote back there
[1:29:33] maybe that's for a reason to where we
[1:29:35] can understand it right
[1:29:39] for us to go to hell we got to go over
[1:29:40] the cross amen that's right
[1:29:44] you've got to reject the word of god to
[1:29:46] be able to go to hangover because god
[1:29:47] made every way in the world
[1:29:49] look what he's done to you and i bring
[1:29:50] us into this message
[1:29:52] the greatest message i don't mean grace
[1:29:54] ever been because that's just every
[1:29:56] message of god all the way through the
[1:29:58] time has been the greatest of all
[1:30:00] but to come down here at the end of all
[1:30:02] times
[1:30:03] and he chose you to be here
[1:30:09] well
[1:30:11] we will get to it one of these days
[1:30:12] brother gary that maybe it is to the
[1:30:14] point that
[1:30:16] paul couldn't take it
[1:30:18] in this day right that's fine
[1:30:22] sure because he's not here
[1:30:26] that's right
[1:30:28] oh my
[1:30:30] you said now wait just a minute you know
[1:30:41] like i've always said
[1:30:43] in the army what they do they
[1:30:45] had a hard-headed nut bunch of nuts and
[1:30:47] they put them in there and put them in
[1:30:48] one group and i got a hard-headed nutted
[1:30:50] old sergeant and they put him in there
[1:30:51] and he just frails the daylights out of
[1:30:54] them till he whips them into it but when
[1:30:55] it comes to fighting on the battlefield
[1:30:58] they want to call the number one troops
[1:31:00] in
[1:31:01] they don't send the bars that wash the
[1:31:03] dishes
[1:31:05] right
[1:31:06] right they call in the guys that are
[1:31:08] tough
[1:31:09] well that's what i said that's what god
[1:31:11] done here he put this old tough nut
[1:31:13] sergeant over you to beat you with the
[1:31:15] message until you'd either believe it or
[1:31:17] get out
[1:31:19] and we don't want to run nobody off we'd
[1:31:20] like to run everybody in
[1:31:24] but we realized that everybody's not
[1:31:26] going to be able to take it
[1:31:30] good luck sister gayle says about it
[1:31:34] but the devil will make you think
[1:31:37] you're going to have to think about what
[1:31:38] is said
[1:31:40] because you're going to have to consider
[1:31:43] you know what it is
[1:31:46] so then your great election that you
[1:31:48] talk about brother brother
[1:31:50] god elected me
[1:31:53] why
[1:31:58] well i'm so pretty
[1:32:03] i just didn't do like everybody else
[1:32:05] done
[1:32:07] now god never elected according to how
[1:32:10] beautiful you looked nor how good any of
[1:32:13] us was
[1:32:14] brother brown says it was trophies of
[1:32:16] his grace that he chose
[1:32:18] uh what it chose abraham and he lied
[1:32:21] he chose this one he chose that and you
[1:32:23] know and every one of them had flaws
[1:32:27] but you know what they turned out to be
[1:32:28] jewels
[1:32:30] in his crown
[1:32:32] america what did they say back years ago
[1:32:36] send us your
[1:32:38] rejected right that's what that old
[1:32:41] great big hand sticking up means
[1:32:43] well they just sent us to me
[1:32:47] still that's the point
[1:32:49] you can get over here we'll help you
[1:32:52] we'll feed you
[1:32:54] all right
[1:32:56] but you see brother they'll always send
[1:32:58] me your people that you don't want
[1:33:01] you know i'll beat them into being
[1:33:02] jewels
[1:33:04] you know
[1:33:06] because
[1:33:07] i believe in
[1:33:08] all of us proving what we are
[1:33:12] and i believe that's what god's looking
[1:33:13] at
[1:33:14] no it's just great revelation brother
[1:33:17] dale well i think that's the greatest of
[1:33:19] all revelation that i've ever seen
[1:33:21] is that god would by his foreknowledge
[1:33:25] looked down through time
[1:33:27] and determined
[1:33:28] that he would not end this thing with
[1:33:30] the apostle paul standing here that he
[1:33:33] would not end it with luther or wesley
[1:33:36] or martin that brother ryan said saint
[1:33:38] martin was the greatest since the
[1:33:39] apostle paul
[1:33:43] he wouldn't end it in their day
[1:33:46] it just then didn't haphazardly happen
[1:33:49] to fall in this day
[1:33:53] there's a seed or word for ever age your
[1:33:56] prophet said
[1:33:57] and there's a people to make that seed
[1:33:59] live
[1:34:01] and that's what god predestinates
[1:34:03] eternally
[1:34:06] but before knowledge he can predestinate
[1:34:08] everything
[1:34:12] and then the thing for him can't say you
[1:34:14] didn't choose me
[1:34:16] you chose everybody else
[1:34:19] you know
[1:34:21] right
[1:34:23] you know we used to get upset in school
[1:34:24] when they we'd line up to play ball
[1:34:27] you know and we'd have to choose teams
[1:34:29] right
[1:34:31] and what you do
[1:34:32] you choose the best you could get
[1:34:35] you take a good one i'll take a good one
[1:34:37] after a while you just throw the lump
[1:34:38] sum of the rest of men
[1:34:42] but you know what i've seen the lump sum
[1:34:44] of these things
[1:34:47] when all of the greatest couldn't hit a
[1:34:49] ball
[1:34:51] they couldn't get on they couldn't make
[1:34:53] a run for nothing
[1:34:55] and i've seen some of them
[1:34:58] you think why did they put that kid in
[1:35:02] you know and see him walk out there and
[1:35:04] hit a ball and win the game
[1:35:07] they used to be
[1:35:12] it used to be two brothers
[1:35:14] that
[1:35:15] played with uh matthew i believe it was
[1:35:18] or it was zach
[1:35:19] the two brothers it was crippled one of
[1:35:21] them was crippled a little bit the other
[1:35:22] one's crippled almost totally just
[1:35:25] you know
[1:35:25] and he hit a ball with one hand
[1:35:30] but you know one day he hit a ball
[1:35:35] and you know everybody on the field was
[1:35:37] tickled to death
[1:35:40] it was worth more than all the others
[1:35:42] could do
[1:35:44] well maybe that's what god's going to do
[1:35:46] with me and you
[1:35:48] you're just going to take what little
[1:35:49] chunk he's got hanging around lula and
[1:35:51] he'll
[1:35:52] he'll try to make a little bride out of
[1:35:54] them let's stand together come on
[1:35:55] brothers
[1:35:57] he'll try to make a jewel out of us
[1:36:01] and we'll hit a home run
[1:36:03] and maybe carry somebody through
[1:36:05] you know
[1:36:07] it'll be a great time
[1:36:10] when we get over there and we look back
[1:36:12] and see
[1:36:14] that you know he did save me because i
[1:36:16] wanted to be saved
[1:36:19] he didn't save me because he wanted me
[1:36:21] to be saved because he had to save
[1:36:22] everybody but he saved me because i
[1:36:25] wanted to be saved
[1:36:28] he predestinated me to a situation that
[1:36:31] i'd have to travel through
[1:36:37] because his foreknowledge let him know
[1:36:40] so then he could elect
[1:36:44] before it ever started
[1:36:47] he could elect
[1:36:49] your election
[1:36:51] he could do that
[1:36:53] he could choose
[1:36:56] by his four knowledge
[1:36:59] his election
[1:37:01] would bring to pay is what we are need
[1:37:03] of
[1:37:04] what do we got
[1:37:07] 24 spiral book 24 in aspire book anybody
[1:37:10] have a need
[1:37:12] think on these things
[1:37:14] i care about god predetermined by your
[1:37:17] desires
[1:37:30] god's four dollars
[1:37:36] and there he looked down and he saw
[1:37:48] diabetes
[1:37:52] so let's just believe
[1:37:53] there's more in here today
[1:37:58] do you pray
[1:38:02] because that's not god's will
[1:38:07] he wants us all to be healed
[1:38:11] all right
[1:38:15] in the name of our lord and savior jesus
[1:38:17] christ
[1:38:19] we bring our brother before you and you
[1:38:21] said for us to come boldly before the
[1:38:23] throne
[1:38:24] and then you look down through time and
[1:38:26] you've seen this your day that we would
[1:38:28] be standing here
[1:38:30] in the very second the time that our
[1:38:33] brother would walk out the desire to be
[1:38:35] healed
[1:38:36] you said it was settled in our seat
[1:38:38] because we made up our mind
[1:38:40] and we just come up to be prayed for to
[1:38:43] agree
[1:38:45] they have somebody to help us
[1:38:47] do we believe it's a mini product
[1:38:50] we call it to be done in the name of
[1:38:52] jesus christ
[1:38:54] because the little bride of christ calls
[1:38:56] for it
[1:39:55] sheltering
[1:40:20] what
[1:40:30] this is a bad hour and a bad time

[1:41:56] and that all thanks be well for your
[1:41:58] honor because we believe you in jesus
