[3:28] him
[3:31] and never give up.
[3:32] Yes.
[3:33] For he so loved this world that he gave
[3:38] his only begotten son. He came and he
[3:41] suffered upon Calvary. Lord that we
[3:43] might have deliverance. And let us just

[4:26] My soul shall make her boast in the
[4:28] Lord.
[4:29] The humble shall hear and be glad.
[4:33] Oh, magnify the Lord with me and let us
[4:36] exalt his name together.
[4:39] I sought the Lord and he heard me and
[4:42] delivered me from all my fears.
[4:46] They looked unto him and were lightning
[4:49] and their faces were not ashamed.
[4:53] This man cried, and the Lord heard him
[4:57] and saved him out of all his troules.
[5:00] The angel of the Lord encamped them
[5:03] round about that fear him and delivered
[5:07] them.
[5:08] Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good.
[5:12] Blessed is the man that trusteth in him.
[5:16] Oh, fear the Lord, ye his saints, for
[5:19] there is no want to them that fear him.
[5:22] The young doer
[5:25] hunger, but they that seek the Lord
[5:28] shall not want any good thing.
[5:32] Come ye children, hearken unto me. I
[5:34] will teach you the fear of the Lord.

[5:54] pursue it.
[5:56] The eyes of the Lord are upon the
[6:00] righteous and his ears are open unto
[6:02] their cry.
[6:04] The face of the Lord is against them
[6:07] that do evil to cut off the remeance of
[6:10] them from the earth.
[6:12] The righteous cry and the Lord heareth
[6:16] their hearth and deliverth them out of
[6:20] all their troubles.
[6:22] Lord
[6:24] of heart.
[6:31] Many are the afflictions of the
[6:33] righteous, but the Lord deliverth them
[6:35] out of them all.
[6:43] Evil shall slay the wicked, and they
[6:45] that hate the righteous shall be
[6:47] desolate.
[6:49] The Lord redeemth the soul of his
[6:52] servants, and none of them that trust in
[6:55] him shall be desolate. Amen. God bless
[6:59] you. May be seated.
[7:14] Let's look at number 665.

[7:48] within,

[9:12] above.
[9:14] Oh yes. Oh yes. I'm a child of the king
[9:22] and his royal

[18:21] Let's look right across the page. Oh, I
[18:24] want to see him. Look upon his face.
[18:33] As I journey through the land, singing
[18:37] as I go, pointing souls to Calvary to
[18:42] the crimson flow.
[18:45] Many arrows pierce my soul from
[18:48] withoutin.
[18:50] But my Lord leads me on. Through him I
[18:54] must win.
[18:56] Oh, I want to see him. Look upon his
[19:00] face there to sing forever
[19:04] of his saving grace. On the streets of
[19:08] glory. Let me lift my voice. Cares all
[19:13] pass at last. ever to rejoice
[19:19] when in service for my Lord. Dark may be
[19:22] the night, but I'll cling more close to
[19:26] him. He will give me light. Satan's
[19:30] snares may vex my soul. Turn my thoughts
[19:33] aside.
[19:35] But my Lord goes ahead, leaves whatever
[19:39] behind.
[19:40] Oh, I want to see him and look upon his
[19:44] face. There to sing forever
[19:48] of his saving grace. On the streets of
[19:52] glory, let me lift my voice. Tears all
[19:57] pass home at last, ever to rejoice.
[20:03] When in valleys low, I look toward the
[20:06] mountain high.
[20:09] And behold my savior there leading in
[20:12] the fight with a tender hand stretch
[20:17] toward the valley low. Oh, he's guiding
[20:20] me and I can see as I onward go. Oh, I
[20:25] want to see him look upon his face.
[20:30] There seems forever
[20:33] of his saving grace on the streets of
[20:37] glory. Let me lift my voice. Cares all
[20:42] pass home at last ever to rejoice.
[20:48] When before me pillows rise from the
[20:51] mighty deep, then my Lord directs my
[20:55] bark. He does safely keep.
[20:58] And he leads me gently on through this
[21:02] world below. Oh, he's a real friend to
[21:06] me. Oh, I love him so.
[21:09] Oh, I want to see him look upon his
[21:13] face. There to sing forever

[21:46] voice. Cares all pass. Home at last.
[21:51] Ever to rejoice.
[21:55] Amen. Amen. Never to rejoice. Always.
[22:00] Amen. Good to see everybody in the house
[22:02] of the Lord. We're glad to have some
[22:04] visitors with us and we're glad to have
[22:06] some that are not visitors with us
[22:08] because we have a thing here. Brother
[22:10] Trevor has been here before. I know
[22:12] years ago seemed like, but anyhow, uh we
[22:15] have a little thing we say when you come
[22:16] the first time, you're a visitor and we
[22:19] say welcome. And if you come back again,
[22:22] you don't get a welcome because you're
[22:24] part of us. So, Brother Herman Darling
[22:27] back there, him and his family and all,
[22:28] they've all been with us. So, you know,
[22:30] that's just part of the family. We don't
[22:32] have anything. Brother Luke and all of
[22:34] them, but glad to have brother Trevor
[22:35] and some of his family, I'm sure, has
[22:38] never been here before. So, we say to
[22:39] you, welcome. Amen. It's a good thing to
[22:43] uh see new faces and smiling faces of
[22:47] those that we'll spend eternity with.
[22:50] That's right.
[22:51] That's a wonderful thing, isn't it?
[22:52] Amen. Remember, now the the Bible study
[22:55] will be this coming Saturday. So come
[22:58] and be with us six o'clock. Remember the
[23:00] announcements. Then to remember the
[23:01] fellowship meeting will be the third
[23:03] Saturday over at brother Tom Kershain in
[23:07] Sweetwater, Tennessee. So you got to let
[23:09] us know if you're going with us or
[23:10] whatever to do, you know, where we can
[23:12] make arrangements. All right. But we're
[23:13] glad to have brother Ernie Villan Noeo
[23:15] with us this morning to and this
[23:17] afternoon to minister unto us. And I
[23:21] know he has a great testimony about the
[23:23] Lord healing him and taking him through
[23:25] the things that, you know, that he has
[23:28] had to to suffer through. But, you know,
[23:30] God always does it. He takes us through.
[23:32] And then we have a glorious time
[23:34] shouting to victory cuz we never did
[23:37] have any troubles. You know, it wouldn't
[23:39] be any fun, would it? Because you
[23:41] wouldn't never have nothing to get over
[23:43] if you never had troubles. But when you
[23:45] do have troubles and things, you get
[23:46] over them, you can say, "Thank you,
[23:48] Lord." Amen.
[23:48] You know, it's great. All right, let's
[23:50] just sing. Open the eyes of my heart as
[23:52] brother Ernie Villoeva comes to minister
[23:55] the word of the Lord unto me.
[23:56] Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[24:01] Open the eyes of my heart.
[24:04] I want to see you.
[24:09] Yes, I want to see you.
[24:15] Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[24:20] Open the eyes of my heart. I want to see
[24:25] you.
[24:28] I want to see you.
[24:32] To see you. I lied up.
[24:38] Shining in the light of glory.
[24:43] to power and love as we sing. Glory,
[24:48] glory, glory.
[24:52] I am lifted up.
[24:56] Shine in the light of my glory.
[25:02] Your power and life. Sing to glory,
[25:06] holy, holy
[25:09] and holy.
[25:12] Amen. Holy, holy, holy.
[25:16] You are holy, holy, holy.
[25:20] Yes, you're holy, holy, holy.
[25:25] I want to see you.
[25:30] Amen.
[25:32] You know, a a lot of people their goal
[25:34] in life, they want to be happy. But I I
[25:37] like that song that we were just singing
[25:39] because the only thing that's greater
[25:41] than happiness is holiness.
[25:44] And I think I'm getting a little sound
[25:46] feedback here.
[25:47] Is Is that Is that normal?
[25:49] Yeah, you're good.
[25:49] Huh?
[25:50] You're good.
[25:50] Okay, good. Well, I want to say how
[25:52] happy I am to be here and uh I'd like to
[25:56] bring greetings from Brother Biscll and
[25:58] all the saints up in Cloverdale and all
[26:00] the churches that I've had the
[26:02] opportunity to travel with in Georgia on
[26:04] the trip. They've all said to They all
[26:06] asked you where you going. They want to
[26:07] know who, what, when, where, and why.
[26:09] And so when I told them I was coming
[26:11] down here, they all said to say hello to
[26:13] you and God bless you. And uh I I just
[26:16] want to give my testimony that I am the
[26:19] happiest person that you have ever met
[26:22] in your entire life.
[26:24] And uh
[26:28] we go through trials in our life. And
[26:30] like brother Sam was saying, if you
[26:31] didn't have problems, then you wouldn't
[26:33] have anything to overcome. And uh the
[26:36] the wonderful thing to know is that if
[26:38] you have received the revelation of this
[26:41] message,
[26:42] your real problem is over
[26:44] and that is where you're going to spend
[26:46] eternity. And uh you know, if if you've
[26:48] got that, it it doesn't matter what the
[26:51] devil throws at you. And brother
[26:53] Brandham said he's a good adversary, but
[26:55] in the message, The Greatest Battle Ever
[26:56] Fought, Brother Brandham told us how to
[26:58] fight our enemy. And uh it wasn't all in
[27:01] one paragraph, but through that book, he
[27:04] says, "Cut them, chop them, whack them,
[27:07] maim them, slice them, kill them."
[27:10] He said, "Don't don't like the to see
[27:12] how long you can make the battle last."
[27:14] He said, he said, you know, "Hit them
[27:16] right at the beginning. Don't go after
[27:17] him with a .22 rifle. Just drop the
[27:20] atomic bomb." And we've got the atomic
[27:22] bomb. We've got thus sayaeth the Lord.
[27:25] Amen.
[27:26] And uh when you've got thus sayeth the
[27:28] Lord on your side, you can walk with the
[27:30] bounce in your step or you can just walk
[27:32] down. I got the token.
[27:34] I got the token inside of me.
[27:36] Amen.
[27:36] And uh so I I want to just go right into
[27:38] the into the word for a second. And I
[27:42] would like to speak today on the bride's
[27:45] inheritance. And I'd like to uh I won't
[27:47] be able to cover it all this morning,
[27:49] but I'll cover part this morning. in
[27:51] part this afternoon and I'd like to turn
[27:53] to the book of Zechariah
[27:57] and chapter 4
[28:00] in verse one
[28:13] Zechariah chapter 4 verse one before we
[28:16] read let's Pray.
[28:20] Father, you know what's in my heart. You
[28:25] know what's in every heart that is here
[28:27] in divine presence. And I pray Lord that
[28:31] as a result of our gathering today and
[28:34] what's
[28:35] going to be said and what you will do
[28:38] Father that you would expand the borders
[28:41] of our supernatural horizons
[28:43] that we would be able to see with a
[28:46] greater clarity with a precision vision
[28:50] of who we are of what you have done for
[28:52] us what you have called us for and what
[28:55] we are here to do. Father,
[28:58] Lord, I pray that you would help each
[28:59] one of us, especially myself. Pray that
[29:02] you would deliver
[29:04] all people from fear, from bondage, from
[29:07] anxiety, from confusion, that they might
[29:09] enter into this service with praise and
[29:12] thanksgiving, with joy in their hearts.
[29:14] For we know the joy of the Lord is our
[29:16] strength, Father. Lord, help each one
[29:19] have your divine purpose and plan
[29:21] accomplished in each life. We ask in
[29:24] your precious name of our Lord Jesus
[29:26] Christ. Amen.
[29:28] Amen. Zechariah 4 and verse one. And the
[29:33] angel that talked with me again,
[29:37] that angel that talked with me came
[29:39] again, and wake me as a man that is
[29:41] wakened out of his sleep, and said unto
[29:43] me, What seeest thou? And I said, I have
[29:45] looked, and behold, a candlestick all of
[29:48] gold with a bowl upon the top of it, and
[29:50] there seven lamps thereon, and seven
[29:52] pipes to the seven lamps which are upon
[29:55] the top thereof, and two olive trees by
[29:58] it, one upon the right side of the bowl,
[30:00] and the other upon the left side
[30:02] thereof. So I answered, and spake to the
[30:04] angel that talked with me, saying, What
[30:06] are these, my lord? Then the angel that
[30:09] talked with me answered and said unto
[30:11] me, "Knowest thou? Knowest thou not what
[30:13] these be?" And I said, "No, my lord."
[30:16] Then he answered and spake unto me,
[30:18] saying, This is the word of the Lord
[30:20] unto Zerubabel, saying, Not by might,
[30:24] nor by power, but by my spirit, sayeth
[30:27] the Lord of hosts. Who art thou, oh
[30:29] great mountain before Zerubabel? Thou
[30:32] shalt become a plain, and he shall bring
[30:35] forth the headstone thereof with
[30:37] shoutings, crying, grace,
[30:39] grace unto it. Moreover, the Lord came
[30:43] unto me, saying, The hand of Zerubabel
[30:46] have laid the foundation of his house.
[30:48] His His hand shall also finish it, and
[30:50] thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts
[30:53] has sent me unto you.
[30:56] For who despise the day of small things?
[30:59] For they shall rejoice, and shall see
[31:01] the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel
[31:04] with those seven. They are the eyes of
[31:06] the Lord, which run to and fro, the
[31:08] whole earth. Then answered I, and said
[31:11] unto him, What are these two olive trees
[31:14] upon this the right side of the
[31:16] candlestick, and upon the left side
[31:18] thereof? And I answered again and said
[31:21] unto him, "What be these two olive
[31:23] branches which through the two golden
[31:26] pipes empty the golden oil out of
[31:28] themselves?" And he answered me and
[31:31] said, "Knowest thou not what these be?"
[31:34] And I said, "No, my Lord."
[31:36] Then said he, "These are the two
[31:39] anointed ones that stand by the house of
[31:42] the whole earth." God bless you. You may
[31:45] have your seats.
[31:49] You know, it's wonderful to see how your
[31:52] how your church has grown and progressed
[31:56] and uh you know, God has put great gifts
[31:59] amongst you, gifts of ministry, gifts of
[32:03] technology. You're blessed to have a
[32:06] projector where you can see the word
[32:08] being projected, you can see the quotes
[32:11] being projected. and uh and your church
[32:13] has had a great a great effect worldwide
[32:17] as a result of your website and the
[32:20] gifts that God has given uh brother Joe
[32:23] and and the other brothers that work in
[32:25] that that area and uh you know your
[32:28] pastor is a dear dear friend of mine and
[32:32] every time I come to Georgia I always
[32:34] look forward to being with brother Sam
[32:36] and sister Peggy and their family. I
[32:38] love being in their home. Their home all
[32:41] when I walk into that home, there is
[32:43] always a supernatural atmosphere in that
[32:46] home. And I can just come and I just I
[32:48] just feel like I can just come and sit
[32:51] and rest. And uh and and my bed is
[32:54] always real comfortable. And there's
[32:56] always about 12 pillows on the bed. When
[32:59] I lay down, I don't know what to what to
[33:01] do with most of them. So, but uh it it's
[33:05] just such a pleasure to know what we
[33:07] know, see what we see, and hear what we
[33:11] hear. Because in in Georgia today, just
[33:14] just take one state out of 50 states,
[33:17] and this is one country out of almost
[33:19] 200 countries in the world. And you you
[33:22] think about the number of sermons
[33:25] that'll be preached in churches, right?
[33:27] All kind of denominations, all kind of
[33:29] cults and clans. And the people, they
[33:32] come to church and they expect to hear
[33:34] something that's going to be a blessing
[33:35] to him. And the minister or the
[33:37] preacher, whoever it is, he throughout
[33:39] the week, he studies, maybe he gets some
[33:43] good illustrations, maybe he he quotes
[33:45] the word, and uh some wonderful things
[33:47] are said and the people, you know,
[33:49] they're blessed. And there there is an
[33:51] anointing in in many of these churches.
[33:53] I can tell you when I was in the Baptist
[33:55] church, there was an anointing in that
[33:58] church. And uh I can't say there was
[34:00] anointing in the cath the holy anointing
[34:02] in the Catholic church cuz that's the
[34:04] highest form of spiritualism there is.
[34:06] And and so uh you know I always say you
[34:08] know it's oxymoron to say that I
[34:11] backslid from the highest form of
[34:13] spiritualism that there is in the earth.
[34:15] But here I was in the Catholic church
[34:18] nine years of Catholic school seven
[34:19] years an alter boy and I backslid from
[34:22] that into the world. It was the best
[34:23] thing that ever happened to me because
[34:25] then I got lost
[34:27] and I had to find out that I needed to
[34:29] get saved and and I I did meet the Lord
[34:32] in the Baptist church and then I went to
[34:34] the Assembly of God church and there was
[34:36] such a powerful anointing in this church
[34:38] that they had five services because it
[34:41] was a great big church and uh and I used
[34:44] to go to all five services because the
[34:46] anointing was so great and the singing
[34:48] was so great. It was like going to a
[34:49] concert, you know, a supernatural
[34:51] concert. And the preaching was good and
[34:54] I was able to meet a lot of wonderful
[34:56] people. And so from there uh you know
[34:58] coming out of Pentecost into United
[35:01] Pentecostal and I thought finally you
[35:03] know I have found the bride of Jesus
[35:06] Christ because they believe they're the
[35:07] bride and we call what we believe the
[35:09] message. They call what they believe the
[35:12] truth. And so, uh, but but I I can tell
[35:14] you we've got a United Pentecostal
[35:16] church not too far from where I live.
[35:19] And there's a whole bunch of of these
[35:21] women that walking around the streets,
[35:23] and if they ever see a real message
[35:25] believer, they run the other way. Cuz
[35:27] their pastor has told them, they said,
[35:29] "Don't you get around any of those
[35:30] Brandommites."
[35:31] And the the brother that had witnessed
[35:34] to me, uh, when I first asked him about
[35:36] Brother Brandham, he said, "Oh, boy,
[35:38] brother Ernie, watch that serpent seed.
[35:40] Don't let it get you. So that was the
[35:43] warning and that's the warning. That's
[35:44] the thing that they put out to keep
[35:46] people away from our assembly. They said
[35:49] they believe that that that that that
[35:51] Eve had had a relations with the
[35:53] serpent. And that really scares people
[35:55] because, you know, unless somebody's
[35:57] able to take them through the Bible, you
[35:59] know, verse by verse by verse and show
[36:01] them the serpent all the way through the
[36:03] Bible, the Revelation, that does sound a
[36:05] little, you know, a little strange. And
[36:08] so, uh, you know, so all these churches
[36:11] that have services and the pastors that
[36:13] preach. Now, if we just take Georgia,
[36:16] that'd be tens of thousands. If we took
[36:18] the America, there'd be millions. If we
[36:21] took the world, there'd be tens of
[36:22] millions or or maybe more. But one thing
[36:25] that I know is that not one of those
[36:29] services, not one of those messages will
[36:32] ever produce a new birth.
[36:35] Right. outside of the message
[36:37] because brother Brandham said there's
[36:38] only one evidence that somebody truly
[36:41] has received the baptism of the Holy
[36:43] Ghost and that is if they have can
[36:46] receive the revelation of the message
[36:48] for their day and manifest the life.
[36:52] That's the key. And we are able by God's
[36:55] grace to manifest the life.
[36:58] Now
[37:01] like to read something to you. Brother
[37:03] Brandham says, and I don't know if
[37:05] brother Joe got this on the screen, but
[37:07] brother brother Brandham says in the
[37:09] message adoption, he says, "There you
[37:11] are entering into this promised land."
[37:14] How do we get into it? We are
[37:17] predestinated to it. The church by the
[37:20] fornowledge of God has been
[37:22] predestinated to what? To his honor, by
[37:25] his grace, to the glory and worship and
[37:27] glory of God. Papa sitting there in the
[37:31] beginning, self-existent, nothing around
[37:34] him, wanted something to worship. So he
[37:37] fore orained and predestinated a church
[37:41] and before the foundation of the world
[37:43] and put their names in the lamb's book
[37:45] of life when they were slain before the
[37:49] foundation of the world that they might
[37:51] appear to his glory and to his praises
[37:54] at the end of time.
[37:57] One will gather all things in that one
[37:59] man Christ Jesus. Woo! Glory. That's it.
[38:02] That's just and that's it right there.
[38:05] Brother, sister, don't you never move
[38:07] from that. God by his election grace
[38:11] called you. God by his election grace
[38:14] sanctified you. God by his election
[38:16] grace and his power baptized you and put
[38:20] you into this land of rest. Amen. Amen.
[38:24] They which have entered into this rest
[38:27] has ceased from their going astray. They
[38:30] ceased from their works like God did
[38:32] from his. They have joy unspeakable and
[38:35] full of glory. The tree of life, I love
[38:38] this. The tree of life is blooming in
[38:41] them.
[38:43] They have longsuffering, gentle
[38:45] goodness, patience, faith, faith,
[38:47] meekness, gentleness, and so forth. The
[38:49] tree of life is blooming in them because
[38:52] their hope is anchored in Christ Jesus,
[38:56] the witness of the Holy Ghost, bearing
[38:58] record with signs and wonders following
[39:01] the believers. These signs shall follow
[39:04] them that believe as they go along. They
[39:06] heal the sick. They cast out devils.
[39:08] They speak with tongues. They see
[39:10] visions. And they walk with God. They
[39:13] talk with God. No devil can move them.
[39:16] They're steadfast looking for eternal
[39:18] life. Forgetting those things that are
[39:20] in the past. They press forward the mark
[39:23] of the high calling in Christ Jesus.
[39:26] They There they are. There you are.
[39:30] That's that church.
[39:31] Now, if we can turn to the book of
[39:34] Ephesians
[39:36] in chapter 1, and this is going to be
[39:38] the the the last part of of our reading
[39:42] for a while. We'll have a little more
[39:44] reading at the near the end of the
[39:46] service. But but Paul is speaking to the
[39:50] Ephesian church. Now Paul, I am sure
[39:53] that as he was able to progress through
[39:56] the different churches that he was so
[39:59] excited to be able to preach a mature
[40:01] message because the Ephesian church was
[40:03] a very mature church. and and the Romans
[40:06] church, you know, you had a congregation
[40:08] of people that were Jews that were
[40:11] coming in that were that were trying to,
[40:13] you know, see this new thing that God
[40:15] was doing. You had raw heathens that
[40:17] come in that had no idea. They had no
[40:20] background of church order. They had and
[40:22] so you had all kind of people and they
[40:24] were arguing about gifts and who was,
[40:26] you know, who was the greatest amongst
[40:28] them. But when Paul is speaking, he
[40:30] said, "Blessed be the God," and this is
[40:32] Ephesians chapter 1 and:e3, "Blessed be
[40:36] the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[40:38] Christ, who had blessed us with all
[40:41] spiritual blessings in heavenly places
[40:43] in Christ, according as he hath chosen
[40:46] us in him before the foundation of the
[40:49] world, that we should be holy and
[40:52] without blame before him in love, having
[40:54] predestinated us unto the adoption
[40:59] of children by Jesus Christ to himself
[41:02] according to the good pleasure of his
[41:04] will to the praise of the glory of his
[41:07] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[41:09] in the beloved in whom now listen this
[41:13] this is so wonderful in in whom we have
[41:16] redemption through his blood the
[41:18] forgiveness of his sins according to the
[41:20] riches of his grace wherein he hath
[41:23] abounded in other words he he has
[41:25] multiplied magnified toward us in all
[41:28] wisdom and prudence, having made known
[41:32] unto us the mystery of his will. Now,
[41:36] who could say this? It was only the
[41:38] bride in each church age. Who could say
[41:42] that he has revealed to them the mystery
[41:44] of his will for that church age?
[41:47] It wasn't for the foolish virgins. It
[41:49] was for the bride of Christ in all those
[41:52] glorious ages that had passed. So having
[41:56] made known unto us the mystery of his
[41:58] will, according to his good pleasure,
[42:01] which he hath purposed in himself, that
[42:03] in the dispensation of the fullness of
[42:04] times, he might gather together in one
[42:07] all things in Christ, both which are in
[42:09] heaven and which are in earth, even in
[42:11] him, in whom also we have obtained an
[42:15] inheritance,
[42:17] being predestinated according to the
[42:20] purpose of him who workketh all things
[42:22] after the counsel of his own will that
[42:25] we should be to the praise of his glory,
[42:27] who first trusted in Christ, in whom ye
[42:30] also trusted after that ye heard the
[42:33] word of truth, the gospel of your
[42:34] salvation, in whom also after that ye
[42:37] believed, ye was sealed with that Holy
[42:40] Spirit of promise, which is the earnest
[42:42] or the down payment of our inheritance
[42:45] until the redemption of the purchased
[42:48] possession under the praise of his
[42:50] glory.
[42:50] Thank you, Lord. Wherefore I also, after
[42:53] I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus,
[42:56] and love unto all the saints, cease not
[42:59] to give thanks for you, making mention
[43:01] of you in my prayers, that the God of
[43:04] our Lord Jesus Christ, and again, here
[43:06] comes another power-p packed little
[43:08] paragraph, that the God of our Lord
[43:11] Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may
[43:13] give unto you the spirit of wisdom and
[43:17] revelation in the knowledge of him. Now
[43:20] the message the message is a
[43:22] supernatural multiplication of
[43:25] inspiration and revelation for
[43:27] communication with God. The bride of
[43:30] Jesus Christ she is on a mystical
[43:33] supernatural journey. And you know, the
[43:36] greatest mistake somebody can make is to
[43:38] underestimate the power of the blood of
[43:41] Jesus Christ to change a sinner from the
[43:44] uttermost and raise him to the uttermost
[43:47] as soon as he believes and receives the
[43:50] word for his day.
[43:52] Amen.
[43:54] that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[43:56] the Father of glory, may give unto you
[43:59] the spirit of wisdom and revelation in
[44:01] the knowledge of him, the eyes of your
[44:04] understanding, being enlightened, that
[44:06] ye may know what is the hope of his
[44:08] calling, and what the riches of the
[44:10] glory of his inheritance in the saints,
[44:12] and what is the exceeding greatness of
[44:14] his power to usward who believe
[44:17] according to the workings of his mighty
[44:20] power, which he wrought in Christ when
[44:22] he raised raised him from the dead and
[44:24] set him at his own right hand in the
[44:26] heavenly places far above all
[44:29] principality and power and might and
[44:31] dominion and every name that is named
[44:33] not only in the world but also in that
[44:36] which is to come.
[44:38] Now,
[44:39] Brother Brandham says some wonderful
[44:41] things in the message that sometimes
[44:44] cause you to just sit back and you've
[44:46] got to go back and you got to read it
[44:48] over and over and over. And one of those
[44:51] was when brother Brandham said, "Now God
[44:54] being a savior, it was necessary for him
[44:59] to predestinate a race of people who
[45:03] would fall
[45:05] in order to give himself reason and
[45:09] purpose for being." And brother Sam, I
[45:12] had to read that over and over and over.
[45:15] you know, yeah, this is one of the only
[45:17] churches that I've ever given my whole
[45:20] testimony. And that testimony, I didn't
[45:22] know that that it was going to be
[45:24] recorded and it was going to be on the
[45:26] website and it was going to go. But I'll
[45:27] tell you, a lot of places I go, I get a
[45:29] lot of emails, a lot of phone call. Hey,
[45:31] brother Ernie, how come you never told
[45:33] me that? Uh you know when I told brother
[45:35] Bisco my testimony and then the brother
[45:37] who witnessed to me come up and and he
[45:39] was staying with brother Ed at his house
[45:41] and brother Ed asked him he said brother
[45:43] Arie said would you give me a testimony
[45:45] how you witness to brother Ernie and so
[45:47] brother Arie said oh brother Ed I don't
[45:48] want to do that I don't want to go into
[45:51] all that and brother Ed said yeah come
[45:52] on brother it'll be a blessing you know
[45:54] and brother Ed's a good salesman so he
[45:56] finally convinced brother Arie and
[45:58] brother Arie told the same testimony as
[46:01] wild of a ride as it was. And
[46:04] afterwards, Brother Ed, he took me into
[46:06] his bedroom. He said, "Now, Brother
[46:07] Ernie," he said, "If anybody in the
[46:09] whole world ought to believe an extreme
[46:13] predestination, it's you, brother."
[46:19] And so, some of these things, you know,
[46:21] that they're they're paradoxes and
[46:23] paradigms that are that are in the
[46:25] Bible. Now, now, Brother Brandham said,
[46:29] I said this was the last one, but
[46:31] brother Brandham says, uh, inheritance
[46:33] by predestination. Then he says, I
[46:36] inherited something.
[46:38] And we're speaking about the bride's
[46:39] inheritance. And brother Brandham says,
[46:41] I inherited something.
[46:43] Then he asks a question, what
[46:45] inheritance?
[46:46] There had to be somebody leave me an
[46:48] inheritance. Why you say Jesus left you
[46:50] an inheritance? And brother Brandham
[46:52] says, uh, beg you pardon? a big question
[46:56] mark at the end. Beg your pardon?
[46:58] He said, "Jesus never left me an
[47:00] inheritance."
[47:02] Jesus never left you an inheritance.
[47:05] He only came down and paid for your
[47:08] inheritance. Brought you to your
[47:11] inheritance, but your name was put on
[47:13] the lamb's book of life before the
[47:15] foundation of the world. God gave you
[47:17] your inheritance. Your inheritance was
[47:19] first. And Jesus only came. And brother
[47:22] Bram says, "Here's the way a lot of
[47:24] people try to make it. God said, "Well,
[47:25] there's a lot of people lost. I I don't
[47:27] want I want them to be saved, so I'll
[47:28] send Jesus down and perhaps maybe uh
[47:30] somebody feel sorry and know what I've
[47:32] done and get saved." And brother
[47:34] Brandham said, "Oh, mercy. I I wouldn't
[47:36] run my office like that. Even as poor as
[47:39] I do run it sometimes, then I wouldn't
[47:41] do it like that. How about God?" But he
[47:44] says, last paragraph, he says, "God by
[47:46] his fornowledge seen exactly who would
[47:50] be saved."
[47:52] Exactly right. And who wouldn't be
[47:54] saved? What did he say to Pharaoh?
[47:56] Pharaoh, even for this purpose have I
[47:59] raised thee up.
[48:01] What did he say about Jacob and Esau?
[48:03] Jacob have I loved. Esau have I hated
[48:06] before the foundation of the world.
[48:09] Judas was raised up to do what he did.
[48:12] Could you imagine? Could you imagine in
[48:14] God's mind if that was one of us that
[48:17] was chosen to be a Judas?
[48:19] Yeah. chosen to be a Pharaoh,
[48:21] right?
[48:22] Chosen to be a Esau,
[48:25] sold his inheritage for inheritance for
[48:27] a mess of pottage,
[48:28] right?
[48:30] So he says God by his fornowledge seen
[48:32] who would be saved and who wouldn't be
[48:34] saved? He sent Jesus to save those that
[48:36] he had already chosen.
[48:39] Didn't Paul say five verses behind this
[48:42] that he chose us and him before there
[48:44] even was a world? That's our
[48:46] inheritance. God chose us and let Jesus
[48:49] come and pay the price. The what? The
[48:52] shedding of his blood that no sin would
[48:54] be accounted to us.
[48:56] Oh my. I mean that that that's just
[48:58] that's just so wonderful. You know, when
[49:00] when when God puts his hand on your
[49:03] life, that bleeding word, it cleanses
[49:06] us. It it it redeems us. It restores us.
[49:10] Brother Brandham said when 2 Corinthians
[49:12] 5:17, "If any man is in Christ, he's a
[49:14] new creature. Old things are passed
[49:16] away. Behold, all things become new. And
[49:19] brother Brandham said, you become a
[49:21] brand new unit. Not not one that's
[49:24] patched up and fixed up and taped up,
[49:26] got some super glue. No, you're a brand
[49:29] new unit. And what each of us needs to
[49:33] know, we need to rejoice. Brother Sam,
[49:35] can I come out and speak out here in
[49:37] front? Yeah. Okay. Now what uh what each
[49:39] one of us we need to have as part of our
[49:43] inheritance we need to have an upto-date
[49:48] revelation of justification.
[49:52] Amen.
[49:53] An upto-ate you know uh on your phone.
[49:55] How many have ever had an upgrade on
[49:56] your phone?
[49:57] How many had an upgrade on your
[49:59] computer? We need to have an upgrade on
[50:02] our revelation of who we are and an
[50:05] upgrade on justification. And and that
[50:09] means it's just as if you never did it
[50:11] in the first place. What a revelation
[50:13] that was to me. I mean, some people they
[50:16] get saved and they go out and sin again
[50:19] and next week they come walk down the
[50:21] altar and the next week go out and sin
[50:23] again and they just keep getting saved
[50:25] and getting lost and getting saved and
[50:27] getting lost.
[50:29] But brother Brandham says that God has
[50:32] the ability to forgive and forget.
[50:38] So we need to have an up-to-date
[50:39] revelation of the sea of God's
[50:42] forgetfulness.
[50:43] Amen.
[50:44] Now the devil, he's not going to let you
[50:46] go. The devil's not going to let you
[50:48] forget. We remember real good who we
[50:52] were. We remember real good what we did.
[50:55] And brother Brandham said, "You can't
[50:57] prevent the birds from flying over, but
[50:59] you can prevent the birds from building
[51:02] a bird's nest in your head."
[51:04] And so you got to go to war with the
[51:06] devil. You know, when I wake up in the
[51:08] morning, I know one thing. There's got
[51:10] to be two deaths that day. I got to die
[51:12] and the devil's got to die. And so when
[51:15] I get on my knees, I take my knee and I
[51:18] grind it into that serpent's neck. Grind
[51:20] it in real good. How do you like that,
[51:23] devil? Ah,
[51:25] the devil said, "Well, what about your
[51:26] past?" I said, "My past is forgiven and
[51:29] forgotten, but what about your past,
[51:31] devil? What about your future?"
[51:33] Right?
[51:34] I got a good future. What about your
[51:36] future? They And you got to talk to the
[51:38] devil.
[51:39] Those demons are real entities, friends.
[51:42] Right.
[51:44] If you you call yourself a part of this
[51:46] bride and you want to, you know, possess
[51:49] your inheritance, you got to know that
[51:50] when you wake up, you got a big old
[51:52] bullseye on your back. And every demon
[51:55] in the area, they know you. They know
[51:58] your address. They know your email
[52:00] address. If you got a Facebook account,
[52:03] they know your Facebook account and
[52:05] everything else. All the technology
[52:08] you're involved in, those demons are
[52:10] acutely aware of everything that you
[52:13] hold dear. And they know where to
[52:16] attack. They know how to attack. That's
[52:19] right.
[52:19] They have a grid. I don't know. It's
[52:21] some kind of a supernatural grid, but
[52:24] they got a list of every time they
[52:25] trapped you, every time they tricked
[52:27] you, every time they deceived you. They
[52:30] said, "Well, let's let's pull this play.
[52:32] We got them before on this play. Let's
[52:34] try this one again." Next thing you
[52:36] know, they come over there and they lay
[52:38] the trap. And if you're if you're not
[52:40] harmless as a dove and wise as a
[52:43] serpent, you walk right into that same
[52:45] trap.
[52:47] Now, you're not done. God will forgive
[52:49] you.
[52:50] And God will continue to forgive you and
[52:53] and cast it into the sea of God's
[52:54] forgetfulness. But, you know, if I could
[52:57] just use a little southern slang
[53:00] because, you know, I used to live in in
[53:02] Florida and I lived in North Carolina
[53:04] and South Carolina.
[53:07] And I learned a long time ago, it is a
[53:11] dumb man that lets a mad dog bite him
[53:14] any more than one time. Right. Exactly.
[53:17] Exactly.
[53:19] Now, why in the world are you going to
[53:21] let the devil trick you on the same
[53:23] thing he tricked you on before?
[53:26] And so, on this journey, on this
[53:29] supernatural journey, we're feeding,
[53:32] we're ingesting, we're metabolizing the
[53:35] word. And the word, you become a
[53:38] supernatural fortress. And I want to
[53:40] speak more about that later this
[53:42] afternoon. But as you read, you've got
[53:45] to be able to discern the will of God.
[53:48] And brother Brandham said, "Do you like
[53:50] to read between the lines?" The bride of
[53:53] Christ is the only ones who can read
[53:55] between the lines.
[53:57] You know, Brother Brandham says some
[53:58] things that when you first read them,
[54:00] it's kind of shocking. You you read the
[54:02] first you read the first few words of
[54:05] the sentence. And brother Brandham said,
[54:07] "Now remember, we went over this before.
[54:11] Don't don't don't don't don't write me
[54:13] off.
[54:14] Brother Brandham said, "Now," he said,
[54:16] "Remember, we're not saved. You're not
[54:19] saved by the blood."
[54:21] Right. Exactly. Right.
[54:22] Now, when I read that, I said, "Well,
[54:24] where is he going with this? Not saved
[54:28] by the blood." He said, "No, you're kept
[54:31] saved by the blood.
[54:33] But you were saved before the foundation
[54:36] of the world when the sons of God
[54:38] shouted for joy. That's our inheritance,
[54:41] friends. That's who we are.
[54:44] You know, you you've got to watch what
[54:46] goes into your eyes and what goes into
[54:48] your ears because the the greatest power
[54:50] God's ever put into our hands is the
[54:53] power of choice.
[54:55] We got 24 hours in a day. Nobody gets
[54:58] 25. Nobody gets short change and only
[55:01] gets 23. And in that 24 hours, it's what
[55:05] you manifest in those 24 hours that's
[55:08] going to develop uh that's going to
[55:10] determine your maturity in Christ.
[55:13] That's right. And so we've got to watch
[55:16] what goes in our eyes and what goes in
[55:18] our ears because once we make the choice
[55:22] to allow something to go in eyes ear and
[55:25] it doesn't matter this there's dozens of
[55:27] mediums that you can allow you can
[55:30] newspapers magazines television movies
[55:33] sports politics business all kind of
[55:35] thing but once you allow it into your
[55:38] eyes or ear it goes to the back row of
[55:40] your mind and there in the back row of
[55:43] your mind is produced a thought
[55:45] and those thoughts become words and
[55:48] words produce actions and actions form
[55:50] habits and habits produces character and
[55:54] character determines your destiny.
[55:56] Right,
[55:57] brother Brandon said pack up all the
[55:58] character you can get cuz it's the only
[56:01] thing you're taken with you.
[56:03] Exactly right.
[56:04] He said you know the the change it
[56:06] doesn't change who you are. It just
[56:08] changes your dwelling place. You're in a
[56:10] different realm. You're in a different
[56:12] sphere, a different atmosphere, a faster
[56:15] dimension. Oh, I can't wait to get into
[56:18] that faster dimension. I can't wait for
[56:20] that young body. I I I can't wait to
[56:23] travel like a thought, perhaps. I can't
[56:25] wait for a for for a whole world that
[56:28] that that operates by faith. Oh my, what
[56:31] a world that's going to be. And where,
[56:34] you know, if brother Brandham said when
[56:36] he was here that that's over 50 years
[56:38] ago, he said we're 3 minutes to
[56:40] midnight. I wonder friends, how many
[56:44] seconds to midnight are we right now?
[56:47] And brother Brandham asked the question,
[56:49] are we sufficiently impressed
[56:53] with what God has done amongst us?
[56:57] Are we sufficiently impressed? Brother
[56:59] Brandham says, he said, "The problem is
[57:01] we don't get deep enough into the word.
[57:04] We got too many other things on our mind
[57:07] besides the word of God."
[57:11] Brother, it's okay to take my jacket
[57:12] off, brother Sam.
[57:14] Okay,
[57:16] everybody. Okay.
[57:18] Amen.
[57:21] Now, here we are. We're caught up in a a
[57:25] supernatural cycle. Here we are. We are
[57:28] transdimensional travelers. We live in a
[57:32] world of the natural, but we're also
[57:34] living in the world of the spiritual, of
[57:36] the supernatural. Now, a believer, a
[57:40] true believer of this message,
[57:44] he is or she is or he is a super
[57:47] intelligent being
[57:50] with a divine purpose in your life.
[57:54] God has a divine purpose for for your
[57:57] life.
[57:57] Amen. And so as as as as we go along on
[58:01] this journey, we come to the
[58:02] understanding that that we're linked up
[58:05] with omnipotence. We're linked up with
[58:08] infallibility. And as long as you stay
[58:10] with the word of God, all your promises
[58:14] that are contained in this word, they
[58:16] are yours. They're promised to you. And
[58:19] all we've got to do is claim them.
[58:21] That's right.
[58:22] Brother Brandham talked about the high
[58:24] priest of our confession sitting at the
[58:26] right hand of majesty waiting to make
[58:29] good any of the predestinated promises
[58:32] in the word. But brother Brandon said
[58:34] you got to claim them. You got to
[58:36] confess them. It's not well, you know,
[58:38] oh Lord, I hope you heal me, Lord. No,
[58:41] you got to confess it. And that
[58:43] confession has got to be backed up by
[58:45] faith. You got to believe it. Brother
[58:47] Brandham said, you know, it doesn't
[58:49] matter how much, you know, you pray or
[58:51] how much you hope. He said, God cannot
[58:54] even go to work on your case until you
[58:57] confess it and you believe it
[59:00] and you wait with great anticipation,
[59:03] great expectation. I know the promise is
[59:06] on the way.
[59:07] Amen.
[59:07] I've gone through several trials
[59:09] recently, but every day I was
[59:11] confessing, Lord, is this the day? every
[59:14] day. You know, uh, brother brother Ed,
[59:16] he said, you know, brother Ernie, he
[59:18] said, just step just take a few more
[59:20] steps today than you took yesterday.
[59:22] Just keep stretching the borders of your
[59:24] horizon and you'll step right into your
[59:27] healing.
[59:28] Just like you're going to step one day,
[59:30] you're going to step right into the
[59:32] rapture. Right.
[59:34] Think about the the Old Testament saints
[59:37] when Jesus was resurrected and the body
[59:41] said in many graves. They came open and
[59:44] the saints went out and they appeared
[59:47] unto many.
[59:48] Now, brother brother Random talks about
[59:50] Abraham and Sarah. They said they went
[59:52] over and said, "Lord, uh, you know,
[59:54] would it be okay if we kind of took a
[59:56] whistle stop tour around Jerusalem and
[59:59] find out how things have changed since
[1:00:01] we were there?" And and Jesus said,
[1:00:03] "Sure, it's okay. We're going to be here
[1:00:05] 40 days, so you know, go ahead." And
[1:00:08] they're walking out there and they're a
[1:00:09] young man and a young woman. And Abraham
[1:00:11] said, "Uhoh, somebody's going to
[1:00:13] recognize us." And they disappeared just
[1:00:16] like Jesus could appear and disappear as
[1:00:18] he did to Simon and Cleophus on the road
[1:00:21] to Emmas. I often think sometimes, you
[1:00:24] know, here they are. They're down in the
[1:00:26] dumps. They're in a deep dark dungeon of
[1:00:29] desperation and despondency and despair
[1:00:32] and disillusionment and doubt and
[1:00:35] they're walking down the road and
[1:00:36] they're saying, "Well, you know, you
[1:00:38] know, we I guess we you know, I guess
[1:00:40] it's all over." And and Jesus himself
[1:00:43] drew near
[1:00:44] and he said, you know, "What's this
[1:00:46] conversation? Why are you so negative?"
[1:00:48] And they looked at him and and they they
[1:00:50] looked right at him.
[1:00:52] They said, "What? Are you a stranger
[1:00:53] around here?"
[1:00:54] Yeah.
[1:00:55] And Jesus was a young man. He wasn't,
[1:00:58] you know, he didn't have gray hair.
[1:01:00] He wasn't stooped down.
[1:01:02] He He was a young man.
[1:01:03] And he walked said, "What's what's this
[1:01:05] that you're that you're talking about?"
[1:01:06] They said, "What are you, a stranger
[1:01:07] around here? Don't you know the things
[1:01:10] that have happened these last few days?"
[1:01:13] And what did Jesus say? He said, "What
[1:01:16] things?"
[1:01:17] In other words, he was checking their
[1:01:19] revelation. He was going, he said, "Uh
[1:01:21] uh, let me let me check your revelation
[1:01:23] here. Let me let me just Okay. Now, what
[1:01:25] things?
[1:01:26] Okay. Tell me what things you know. Tell
[1:01:28] me what you know about what's happened
[1:01:30] the last few days.
[1:01:31] And they say, "Well, concerning Jesus,
[1:01:33] you know, he's a great man, a prophet
[1:01:35] approved of God, and our leaders have
[1:01:37] killed him, you know, and now certain of
[1:01:38] our company, they've been at the tomb,
[1:01:40] and they said he's not there, and and
[1:01:42] and now we can't find him."
[1:01:44] And and and Jesus, could you imagine if
[1:01:46] Jesus ever had to speak to you like
[1:01:49] this? Like he spoke to Simon and
[1:01:51] Cleopus. He looked at them and he said,
[1:01:55] "Oh fools,"
[1:01:57] right
[1:01:58] and slow of heart to believe all the
[1:02:00] prophets have spoken. And beginning at
[1:02:02] Moses and all the prophets, he spoke of
[1:02:05] all the things concerning himself,
[1:02:07] right?
[1:02:08] Often think what if Simon and Cleopus
[1:02:11] said, "Wait a minute. Who you calling a
[1:02:13] fool?"
[1:02:14] Don't you know who I am? How many times
[1:02:16] have we ever heard that saying,
[1:02:17] right? You know, somebody gets drunk and
[1:02:19] they're in a bar and the police come and
[1:02:21] they grab them. They're going to take
[1:02:22] him home. They say, "Wait a minute.
[1:02:23] Don't you know who I am?"
[1:02:25] Or somebody wants to play the big shot.
[1:02:27] You don't you know who I am?
[1:02:29] They could have said that to Jesus.
[1:02:32] But they didn't. And Jesus, you know, he
[1:02:35] they took him on a six-hour sermon. Can
[1:02:37] you imagine going on a six-hour sermon?
[1:02:40] And Jesus, okay, now here's Moses. And
[1:02:42] he took all the types, all the shadows
[1:02:44] through Moses and all the prophets. And
[1:02:47] then at the end he's all done giving
[1:02:49] them a sermon. Six hours on the road to
[1:02:53] Emmas. And finally when they come to the
[1:02:55] village Jesus made like he would have
[1:02:57] gone further. He said well fellas see
[1:03:00] you later. Bye-bye. And he said, "Oh no,
[1:03:03] you've got to come with us."
[1:03:05] And brother Branch said that was their
[1:03:06] character showing through.
[1:03:08] Right?
[1:03:08] See see they wanted to they wanted to
[1:03:10] feed Jesus.
[1:03:12] But what they didn't know Jesus wasn't
[1:03:14] done feeding them.
[1:03:15] Right? Amen.
[1:03:16] And so they asked him to break the
[1:03:17] bread, bless the food, and he did it.
[1:03:20] And he did something in a certain way
[1:03:22] that caused their eyes to come open.
[1:03:25] They said, "It's the Lord." And he
[1:03:27] disappeared.
[1:03:28] Right?
[1:03:28] Vanished out of their sight.
[1:03:30] Right?
[1:03:31] Now, they knew a little bit more about
[1:03:33] the word.
[1:03:34] Right?
[1:03:34] But they didn't know all about the word.
[1:03:37] Now, they could have said to Jesus,
[1:03:38] "Wait a minute. You know who I am? I've
[1:03:41] been with the Lord for three years. I
[1:03:44] was there when he did this and that and
[1:03:46] this and this and that and that. I know
[1:03:48] all these things and here you are young
[1:03:50] whippers snapper. Who do you think you
[1:03:52] are calling us apostle calling us fools?
[1:03:55] Yeah.
[1:03:56] But they didn't know anything about the
[1:03:58] word.
[1:04:00] And and so now do you think when they
[1:04:02] were going back to Jerusalem do you
[1:04:04] think it took them six hours to go back?
[1:04:06] No. They were running. And the one thing
[1:04:08] I I don't think they bothered eating.
[1:04:11] Don't think they bothered with the food.
[1:04:12] They were running with the message and
[1:04:15] they got back and they found out where
[1:04:16] the apostles were and they went in there
[1:04:18] and they told them all the things Jesus
[1:04:20] told
[1:04:21] and the Bible says and while they yet
[1:04:25] believed not.
[1:04:28] So what what what category were they in?
[1:04:31] Yeah.
[1:04:32] They weren't a believer
[1:04:33] at that time.
[1:04:35] They were believing in what they thought
[1:04:36] they knew,
[1:04:37] but they weren't a believer in what was
[1:04:39] actual happened. See, see, I want to be
[1:04:41] a truth broker today. I want to be a
[1:04:44] reality broker and deal with truth in
[1:04:46] large doses and strip away all the fluff
[1:04:49] and all the veneer. And when you get
[1:04:50] down to that bare knuckle truth, if you
[1:04:53] take the number of people who are
[1:04:55] following this message worldwide, these
[1:04:58] are the numbers. This is just a
[1:04:59] guesstimate.
[1:05:01] 99.999.
[1:05:05] And you could probably add another nine
[1:05:06] on that. Of the people of 7 billion
[1:05:09] people in the world, they know nothing
[1:05:12] about this message.
[1:05:14] Amen.
[1:05:15] Brother Brandham said, "When Jesus was
[1:05:17] on the earth, only 1/100th of 1% knew
[1:05:21] that God was on the earth." How blessed
[1:05:24] you are. How privileged you are to be
[1:05:28] the virgin, spotless, undefiled bride of
[1:05:31] Jesus Christ. Are we fully possessing
[1:05:35] the inheritance that God gave us before
[1:05:37] the foundation of the world? Are we
[1:05:39] walking without guilt, without shame,
[1:05:42] without condemnation, without any,
[1:05:44] without confusion, without inferiority
[1:05:48] complaint? Brother Brandham said the
[1:05:49] message came to take the fear off the
[1:05:52] people. And that word fear, fe a r,
[1:05:54] false evidence appearing real. But it's
[1:05:57] one of Satan's most clever tactics. He
[1:06:00] wants to put fear because fear it will
[1:06:03] immobilize you. It will paralyze you.
[1:06:06] It will lead you to be negative and
[1:06:08] pessimistic and pessimism is it's a it's
[1:06:12] a it's a a a a negative attitude that
[1:06:16] goes in the mind and it permeates a
[1:06:18] person's being who they are and fear and
[1:06:22] negativity. It causes procrastination.
[1:06:25] It causes anxiety. It causes all these
[1:06:29] negative traits to become a part of a
[1:06:32] person and they don't fully possess the
[1:06:35] inheritance
[1:06:36] that God has given to them.
[1:06:39] Now I say this because I you know the
[1:06:42] Bible says know you not when you preach
[1:06:44] to somebody else you're preaching to
[1:06:45] yourself
[1:06:46] and when I preach I want to have a good
[1:06:48] service not because I'm speaking but
[1:06:51] because I know the words that I speak
[1:06:53] are just edifying what I believe. Right?
[1:06:56] And a lot of times I say a whole bunch
[1:06:58] of things that I had no idea of saying,
[1:07:01] you know, and it wasn't me. It was the
[1:07:03] Holy Spirit that came and took over my
[1:07:05] tongue and said something that maybe
[1:07:07] somebody here needs to say.
[1:07:10] Maybe somebody here needs to have an
[1:07:13] upto-date revelation of justification
[1:07:16] and the sea of God's forgetfulness.
[1:07:19] Amen.
[1:07:19] You know, I speak at a youth camp. I
[1:07:21] have the youth they they love they love
[1:07:23] illustrations. And so I have them take a
[1:07:26] pad of paper and I have them write down
[1:07:29] write down all your sins and all your
[1:07:32] mistakes, all the failures, all the
[1:07:34] disappointment, all the rejection, all
[1:07:36] the misunderstandings, everything that's
[1:07:39] happened in your life that has been, you
[1:07:42] know, not completely edifying. I said,
[1:07:44] now this is for your eyes only. Nobody
[1:07:49] else should see this list.
[1:07:51] Right?
[1:07:52] Are you with me so far? Now you need to
[1:07:54] go and get a shovel and get a match and
[1:07:58] get a rock and get some red paint and a
[1:08:02] paintbrush. And after you have your
[1:08:04] list, you get the shovel and you dig a
[1:08:07] hole. And then you get the match and you
[1:08:09] light the papers on fire and you take
[1:08:12] the ashes and you put them down in the
[1:08:15] hole and you cover up the hole and you
[1:08:18] put the rock on there and you get the
[1:08:20] red paint and the paintbrush and you put
[1:08:22] rest in peace.
[1:08:26] Have a formal funeral for your past. And
[1:08:29] every time those hounds of hell, every
[1:08:32] time those demons of doubt, they try to
[1:08:34] come and assault your mind, you go right
[1:08:36] out and say, "Devil, you are a liar."
[1:08:39] Right?
[1:08:40] I buried you.
[1:08:42] Right?
[1:08:42] You tricked me before, but I didn't know
[1:08:45] then what I know now. I know who you
[1:08:48] are, and I know who I am.
[1:08:51] I'm the boss around here.
[1:08:54] You're the defeated foe. Amen.
[1:08:56] Your time on earth is limited.
[1:09:04] So a believer, he has Zoe life,
[1:09:09] a a a life that the world knows nothing
[1:09:12] about. We have got we have got into the
[1:09:15] symphony of the Lord. And we're beating
[1:09:17] out we're beating out the rhythm and the
[1:09:20] harmony. A a and we're walking and we're
[1:09:23] talking and we're living according to a
[1:09:26] supernatural word that has come our way.
[1:09:30] I wonder as we consider and deeply
[1:09:34] ponder what God has has done for us
[1:09:39] that we have God's DNA
[1:09:42] in us.
[1:09:43] We've got God's genetic code in us.
[1:09:46] We're operating with a divine mind.
[1:09:49] We're operating with a divine nature
[1:09:52] through an unconditional
[1:09:54] supernatural covenant that God has laid
[1:09:57] down for us.
[1:10:00] We've got a right. You've got a right to
[1:10:02] eagle life. You've got a legal right to
[1:10:05] eagle life.
[1:10:06] Oh, I think that's wonderful. That was
[1:10:08] the first message I ever read was as the
[1:10:10] eagle stirth her nest. And when I read
[1:10:14] that message, oh, I knew it wasn't a
[1:10:16] man. I knew something was coming from
[1:10:19] another realm. And something was
[1:10:21] stirring my soul like it had never been
[1:10:24] stirred before. And I had been in a lot
[1:10:26] of revival. I'd been in a lot of great
[1:10:29] meetings in the Assembly of God and the
[1:10:31] UPC. I'd been in I've heard great
[1:10:34] preachers. But when I read that book,
[1:10:36] friends, something changed inside of me.
[1:10:40] I became a bra. I became a part of a
[1:10:43] unique creation of God, the bride of
[1:10:47] Jesus Christ. I didn't know where it was
[1:10:49] going to take me, but I knew I was going
[1:10:52] to follow it as far as it would take me.
[1:10:55] Just as God gave me faith to leave the
[1:10:57] Catholic church with all my family
[1:10:59] saying, "How can you leave the mother
[1:11:01] church? I left the Baptist church. Oh,
[1:11:04] you're going out with all those tongue
[1:11:05] speakers and I left the assembly of God.
[1:11:08] Oh, you're going out with all those
[1:11:09] oneness people, all those Jesus name
[1:11:12] people. Jesus only. And I come to the
[1:11:14] message and the you say, "Oh, you're
[1:11:16] following a man. You're you're in a cult
[1:11:18] now." Hey, but every time I had to
[1:11:21] leave, I had my I had my exit order. I
[1:11:24] had to leave that and enter into
[1:11:26] something else.
[1:11:27] [Music]
[1:11:31] Glory.
[1:11:33] I wonder
[1:11:35] how's your mystical supernatural journey
[1:11:38] going.
[1:11:40] Your brother Brandham said a mystic is
[1:11:42] one, you know, he he's talking about the
[1:11:44] mystical body of Jesus Christ. So I went
[1:11:46] and I looked in the dictionary. I said,
[1:11:48] "What what is a mystic?" Cuz I always
[1:11:50] thought it was, you know, some kind of
[1:11:52] hookie spooks, you know, some kind of
[1:11:54] thing like the witches do, you know,
[1:11:56] mystics and all in a new age, new age.
[1:11:59] So, I went in the Bible and I looked up
[1:12:01] the definition of the word mystic. And
[1:12:04] the definition of a mystic
[1:12:07] is one who seeks after
[1:12:12] and attains
[1:12:15] direct intercourse with God.
[1:12:18] That's according to Webster. Now, now,
[1:12:20] how many mystics are here?
[1:12:22] Sure, we're mystics on a mystical
[1:12:25] journey. The mystical bride,
[1:12:27] right?
[1:12:29] And we know that our God, you know, this
[1:12:30] message is the only thing in the world
[1:12:32] that sounds like it's too good to be
[1:12:35] true. And yet we we cannot even begin to
[1:12:38] to really know at this point how good
[1:12:41] it's going to get.
[1:12:42] The Bible said, "Eyes haven't seen, ears
[1:12:44] haven't heard. The mind of man has not
[1:12:48] even begun to imagine how the things
[1:12:50] that God has prepared for those who love
[1:12:52] him and are called according to his
[1:12:55] word."
[1:12:56] Amen. And so we've got to get deep into
[1:13:01] the word.
[1:13:02] Glor,
[1:13:03] you know, in in just closing now, the
[1:13:05] bride of Christ, she's got so many uh
[1:13:09] examples in the Bible of the power of
[1:13:13] God's love and his forgiveness. We could
[1:13:16] look at Adam and Eve and and what
[1:13:18] happened to them. We can look at the
[1:13:20] serpent who God offered. He he offered
[1:13:23] his he said, "Why are you so downcast?
[1:13:25] Why are you so discouraged? Do as your
[1:13:27] brother has done and won't you be
[1:13:29] accepted. So, so grace was offered to
[1:13:32] the serpent.
[1:13:34] See to the serpent.
[1:13:36] But there was nothing in him to receive
[1:13:38] it. I am so thankful that I can say if
[1:13:41] brother Brandham said it, I believe it
[1:13:43] and that settles it.
[1:13:45] I don't care about some what somebody's
[1:13:48] interpretation about something that
[1:13:50] happened or didn't happen on a certain
[1:13:52] day or I don't care about those things.
[1:13:55] I was just walking into brother Sam's
[1:13:57] office there and I saw the the the the
[1:14:00] mountain there with brother Brandham's
[1:14:02] face supernaturally carved out on the
[1:14:05] side of the mountains and I said well
[1:14:07] you know what do these people who have
[1:14:10] left the message
[1:14:12] what are they going to what are they
[1:14:14] going to do when they see that mountain
[1:14:16] and they have they have spoken for 20 30
[1:14:19] 40 years about all these things and ah
[1:14:23] somebody must have carved That must have
[1:14:25] been they must have got some big old
[1:14:26] ladders and they must have had brother
[1:14:28] Brandham's picture and you know they
[1:14:30] they carved it out of the No, that
[1:14:32] wasn't that wasn't man that did that
[1:14:34] friends. That was God.
[1:14:36] God did that.
[1:14:38] We look at the grace of Noah and his
[1:14:40] family of Abraham and Sarah the grace
[1:14:43] that God showed to them.
[1:14:44] Yes.
[1:14:46] Moses Moses was a murderer for 40 years.
[1:14:49] He wandered in the desert thinking, you
[1:14:51] know, God's all done with me. He'll
[1:14:53] never want to talk to me again.
[1:14:56] 40 years.
[1:14:59] Think about the tortured mind of Moses
[1:15:01] having been stripped from the pinnacle
[1:15:04] of power and the pinnacle of glory and
[1:15:08] education and and military strategy,
[1:15:12] the best food, the best entertainment.
[1:15:15] Oh yeah. to be stripped from that and to
[1:15:19] be out for 40 years in the backside of a
[1:15:21] desert before God come to speak to him.
[1:15:25] Moses had no idea what God had in store
[1:15:27] for him. And you know, sometimes we have
[1:15:30] no idea what God has in store for us.
[1:15:34] We don't know. We don't know what the
[1:15:36] future holds, but we know who holds the
[1:15:38] future. I just want to drop in this for
[1:15:41] you young people, those of you who are
[1:15:43] in your teens or 20s or even 30s, you
[1:15:45] have a great treasure, you have the
[1:15:47] treasure of youth on your side. And if
[1:15:50] you take if you take wisdom and you take
[1:15:53] that wisdom and the knowledge and the
[1:15:55] power of God and you you you just uh
[1:15:58] allow your your your youth and that
[1:16:01] treasure of of of energy to be fused
[1:16:04] with the power of God, you become a
[1:16:06] human dynamo. and start early. Well, you
[1:16:10] know, when I get to be an old man like
[1:16:12] brother Ernie, well, you know, then I'll
[1:16:14] start then. No, that that's too late.
[1:16:16] You're going to think back of all the
[1:16:18] wasted years, all that you could have
[1:16:21] done.
[1:16:22] You know, one thing when you go to
[1:16:24] witness to somebody, I just want to drop
[1:16:25] this in. When you go to witness to
[1:16:27] somebody or speak to somebody or deal
[1:16:30] with somebody on any level,
[1:16:34] people don't care how much you know
[1:16:37] until they know how much you care.
[1:16:41] And to go right along with that, it's
[1:16:43] not so much the matter you cover, it's
[1:16:47] the manner in which you cover the matter
[1:16:51] that counts. I'll give you an example
[1:16:53] and it's only because I know you so well
[1:16:55] and you know me so well I I can drop a
[1:16:57] little bit of humor in. Okay. Now, if a
[1:16:59] man was sitting uh at the restaurant and
[1:17:01] and he and his wife were there and uh
[1:17:04] you know, maybe they had a a candle
[1:17:05] going and uh you know, they were sitting
[1:17:07] there nice nice romantic place and if
[1:17:10] that man said to his sweetheart, he
[1:17:12] said, he said, "You know, honey," he
[1:17:14] said, "When I when I look in your eyes,
[1:17:17] it just seems like time stands still."
[1:17:22] Now, that would be nice, right? But what
[1:17:24] if he said, "Man, your face could stop a
[1:17:26] clock."
[1:17:28] Now, you said the same thing. What's
[1:17:32] time, stand still or stop a clock,
[1:17:34] right? What's the difference? The
[1:17:36] difference is one of them you're going
[1:17:38] to get a hug. The other one you're going
[1:17:39] to get you're going to get slapped
[1:17:41] upside your face.
[1:17:43] It is the same thing with how we deal
[1:17:45] with people.
[1:17:46] Exactly. Right.
[1:17:47] It's it's our manner. It's our tone.
[1:17:50] It's our tenor. Brother Brandham said,
[1:17:52] "You got to put yourself in the other
[1:17:54] person's shoes." You know, we all want
[1:17:57] everybody to be saved. You know, there's
[1:17:59] a paradigm. We want to get everybody
[1:18:01] saved, but brother Brandham said, "Well,
[1:18:03] sometimes I have to say some things to
[1:18:05] cause people to go away
[1:18:08] because there's too many people
[1:18:09] following the message."
[1:18:12] How about that one?
[1:18:13] That was I couldn't I couldn't wrap my
[1:18:15] brain around that for a while. Then I
[1:18:17] read Brother Ram said, "There's too many
[1:18:19] creepers
[1:18:20] around and we had to get rid of the
[1:18:22] creepers." Yeah.
[1:18:24] And so I hope you're not one of the
[1:18:26] creepers.
[1:18:27] I hope you're not one of the ones that
[1:18:28] something's going to be said that's
[1:18:30] going to cause you to go away. I know a
[1:18:32] lot of them that have gone away.
[1:18:34] Something that was said. But again, the
[1:18:37] bride because of your inheritance, you
[1:18:39] speak with an authority of thus sayaeth
[1:18:42] the Lord. You can speak, you know,
[1:18:44] you're one of the one that's in the Holy
[1:18:46] of Holy. Brother Brandham said when they
[1:18:48] come out, they're so sweet. He said,
[1:18:50] "You ever been, you ever been with
[1:18:51] somebody who's been there a and been
[1:18:54] communicating with God and they come
[1:18:56] out, they're so kind? They're so gentle.
[1:18:59] You just He said, "Some people you just
[1:19:01] can't wait to be around them."
[1:19:03] You people are like that to me.
[1:19:06] But there's some people you can't wait
[1:19:08] to get away from them.
[1:19:11] They come around the the biggest mistake
[1:19:13] you ask some people sometime is, "Well,
[1:19:15] how you doing?" Oh, well, let me tell
[1:19:17] you how I'm doing. You know, and if I
[1:19:19] had a trash can here, I'd show you. They
[1:19:21] said, "Well, you know what's happened to
[1:19:23] me? Nobody understands me and nobody
[1:19:26] likes me and the bosses he he's he's
[1:19:29] promoted somebody and my cars broke down
[1:19:31] and and somebody hacked my computer and
[1:19:34] somebody hacked my identity." And I
[1:19:36] mean, they I mean, you know, you want to
[1:19:38] talk about negative.
[1:19:40] It's like uh you know it's like a train
[1:19:44] of of of verbal insanity coming out of
[1:19:47] their mind. And brother Brandham said
[1:19:49] without this message a person is in an
[1:19:53] insane condition
[1:19:56] outside of this message.
[1:19:58] So just coming down to a close now h how
[1:20:01] about uh David the grace God showed to
[1:20:06] David. Amen.
[1:20:07] You ever wonder why when David went to
[1:20:09] slay slay Goliath, you ever wonder why
[1:20:12] he picked up five smooth stones?
[1:20:15] Because Goliath had four brothers.
[1:20:18] And David didn't know if he was going to
[1:20:20] have to take care of all of them
[1:20:21] or just one of them. So he had five
[1:20:23] smooth stones. He took care of one of
[1:20:25] them and the other ones they ran.
[1:20:27] See, but David was shown so much great
[1:20:31] raised, you know, taken from the sheep
[1:20:33] coat, raised to be the king. And even
[1:20:35] after he committed murder, God still was
[1:20:38] with him.
[1:20:39] But there was rape and there was there
[1:20:42] was there was there was treachery. There
[1:20:44] was betrayal that followed David because
[1:20:47] of what he did.
[1:20:49] How about Saul? Brother Brandham said,
[1:20:51] "Now don't you put Saul in hell." He
[1:20:53] Saul wasn't lost. He just backslid. He
[1:20:57] got away from God. Now, I mean, you go
[1:20:59] to a denomination and try to tell a
[1:21:01] denomination that Saul Saul wasn't lost.
[1:21:04] You're right.
[1:21:05] How about Solomon? Solomon probably the
[1:21:08] richest man in the history of the world
[1:21:11] up until that time. I don't know where
[1:21:12] he would compare with Bill Gates and
[1:21:14] Warren Buffett and some of these rich
[1:21:16] guys over in Russia now. I don't know.
[1:21:18] But uh up till that time he was the
[1:21:20] richest. He had the power. He had the
[1:21:23] anointing. He had the gift. He had
[1:21:25] everything going for him.
[1:21:27] But later in life,
[1:21:30] he had an eye problem. Yeah.
[1:21:32] And the eye problem was women.
[1:21:35] I I I I I.
[1:21:38] And he had hundreds of them.
[1:21:41] And some of them were heathen. Some of
[1:21:42] them were pagans. Some of them were were
[1:21:45] into human sacrifice, taking babies and
[1:21:47] putting them on the altar and
[1:21:49] slaughtering. Those were Solomon's
[1:21:50] wives.
[1:21:52] And at the end, Solomon says, and now
[1:21:55] here's the richest man in the world. At
[1:21:57] the end of his life, he says, "Vanity,
[1:22:00] vanity. All is vanity.
[1:22:04] Amen. Exactly.
[1:22:05] And he encouraged people to serve God
[1:22:07] with all that's that's in you.
[1:22:09] Amen.
[1:22:10] We think about Ruth and Esther and and
[1:22:12] and the widow woman that Elijah came to.
[1:22:16] We think about the woman at the well,
[1:22:19] the woman that was taken in the very act
[1:22:21] of adultery. Zakius the businessman.
[1:22:24] These are all types for you and I to
[1:22:26] look at and see how God dealt with them.
[1:22:29] And then we say, "Well, I know how God's
[1:22:31] dealing with me. I know where God's
[1:22:33] brought me from."
[1:22:34] Amen.
[1:22:36] You think about the demon-possessed man.
[1:22:38] Jesus heard him from another country.
[1:22:41] And when he heard him, he got in the
[1:22:43] boat
[1:22:44] and every demon in that area tried to
[1:22:46] sink that boat and every boat on the
[1:22:48] sea.
[1:22:50] And and and the apostle filled with fear
[1:22:52] said, "Master, don't you care that we
[1:22:54] perish?" And he got up and he spilled
[1:22:56] the winds and still the waves. And they
[1:22:58] said, the apostle said, "Wow, we've seen
[1:23:00] a lot of things. We ain't never seen
[1:23:02] nothing like that before." See, and a
[1:23:05] and so then he goes and you know the
[1:23:07] story and and and first of all, he comes
[1:23:10] and throws himself down to worship the
[1:23:11] Lord. Then the demons take over. The
[1:23:13] demons say, you know, we don't want why
[1:23:16] are you doing this? You know, they cast
[1:23:17] us into the pigs. And so Jesus did him a
[1:23:19] favor. He cast them into the pigs. Now
[1:23:22] the pigs, they did the only decent
[1:23:24] thing,
[1:23:25] right? They ran and killed themselves
[1:23:28] cuz not even a pig wants to live with
[1:23:30] demons in them.
[1:23:33] So if a pig doesn't want to live with
[1:23:35] demons in them, why should we live with
[1:23:37] the with with the demon's habits?
[1:23:40] Influencing us.
[1:23:43] Amen.
[1:23:45] Think about the prodigal son and the
[1:23:47] grace that God had for him that the
[1:23:49] father was looking for him. From the
[1:23:51] moment he went away, the father was
[1:23:53] waiting for his return, waiting with the
[1:23:56] coat, waiting with the fatted calf,
[1:23:59] waiting with all these things. And no
[1:24:01] matter what condition you are in today,
[1:24:04] friends, if you've got to make something
[1:24:06] right with God, make it right and God
[1:24:09] will be right there to receive you.
[1:24:12] Listen, listen to this.
[1:24:13] Just just write write this down. In the
[1:24:16] station of creation, in your
[1:24:19] imagination,
[1:24:21] your dream machine of excitement and
[1:24:24] enchantment and ecstasy.
[1:24:27] God is never more like God
[1:24:31] than when he's forgiving.
[1:24:35] And man is never more like God than when
[1:24:39] he's forgiving. Right.
[1:24:41] Brother Brand said, "If a man's done you
[1:24:43] wrong and you know he's done you wrong,"
[1:24:45] he said, "Don't mention that.
[1:24:47] Take him to the Lord in prayer.
[1:24:50] Tell the Lord what's happened."
[1:24:51] He said, "Then when you come back down
[1:24:54] again, where were you?"
[1:24:56] He said, "When you come back down to
[1:24:58] earth again, where have you been?
[1:25:00] You've been in a supernatural realm.
[1:25:02] You've been talking to the Lord." Amen.
[1:25:05] You know, when the one of the things
[1:25:07] that anchored me down real good, I mean,
[1:25:11] tied me down where I was unshakable was
[1:25:14] when I heard brother Brandham said,
[1:25:16] "Now, sister, you're here and I don't
[1:25:18] know you and you don't know me, but
[1:25:20] there is one here who does know you and
[1:25:22] does know me." He said, "Now, now if you
[1:25:24] can catch this, friends, if you haven't
[1:25:27] seen this or if you haven't caught it,
[1:25:29] this might be the kernel that you need
[1:25:32] for today." Brother Brandham said,
[1:25:34] "Now," he said, "there is one here knows
[1:25:37] you, knows me." Now when he and his
[1:25:40] spirit, talking about Jesus, when he and
[1:25:43] his spirit comes in, me and my spirit
[1:25:48] goes away.
[1:25:49] Yeah.
[1:25:50] And he gives me a temporary resurrection
[1:25:54] in my spirit.
[1:25:55] Exactly. Right.
[1:25:56] And he wants to use my body.
[1:26:00] And I'm so happy to loan it to him.
[1:26:03] Anything he can get out of it. Now I had
[1:26:06] to read that over and over and I had to
[1:26:09] wrap my brain around that. Then I had to
[1:26:11] wrap my heart around it. Then my soul
[1:26:14] got wrapped and I understood
[1:26:17] the world is different since I came to
[1:26:19] this message. I'm different. My future's
[1:26:22] different.
[1:26:23] Exactly right. Amen.
[1:26:27] What happened when Jesus came in and
[1:26:30] told people your name is your address is
[1:26:33] you're not here for you're here for
[1:26:34] somebody else and goes back two or three
[1:26:36] generations in their genealogy.
[1:26:39] That wasn't brother Brandham.
[1:26:42] That was Jesus Christ using his
[1:26:46] ordained, anointed, predestinated Elijah
[1:26:50] prophet.
[1:26:52] And Jesus had a right to that body.
[1:26:54] He's got a right to my body.
[1:26:57] He's got a right to your body.
[1:26:59] Your body is the temple of the living
[1:27:01] God.
[1:27:03] So I often think of it, you know,
[1:27:05] brother Brandham, his spirit has gone
[1:27:07] away. He's in a resurrection process.
[1:27:09] And then when Jesus is done with his
[1:27:11] body, often think brother Brandham's
[1:27:14] spirit got slammed back into that human
[1:27:17] body. And he said now he said now
[1:27:21] it's all like a dream to me but whatever
[1:27:23] he said you do it. Oh my what a word we
[1:27:27] have got friends.
[1:27:29] What a message we have got.
[1:27:33] Who would who would have ever been able
[1:27:35] to tell you outside of the message the
[1:27:37] three stages of the rich young ruler and
[1:27:39] his eventual end? Rich young ruler had
[1:27:43] opportunity to speak to God. Ask him the
[1:27:46] right question. the best question.
[1:27:50] What must I do to inherit eternal life?
[1:27:52] He asked the only person who could tell
[1:27:54] him.
[1:27:56] And Jesus looked into his life and he
[1:27:58] saw that money was going to become his
[1:28:00] god. He said, "Look, go and sell
[1:28:03] everything you've got.
[1:28:06] Give it to the poor
[1:28:08] and come follow me." In other come and
[1:28:10] be my disciple.
[1:28:12] And the rich young ruler, this guy's a
[1:28:15] homeless man.
[1:28:17] Look at his clothes. He doesn't know
[1:28:19] where he's going to get his next meal.
[1:28:21] N.
[1:28:21] And I'm going to give up all of I got to
[1:28:24] live this kind of a life. No. No. Can
[1:28:27] do.
[1:28:29] Gone.
[1:28:30] Eternally gone.
[1:28:32] Eternally separated
[1:28:34] from the mind of God
[1:28:36] and the presence of God.
[1:28:38] Amen.
[1:28:39] Look at Peter. Denies the Lord three
[1:28:41] times and he cursed
[1:28:43] the third time. He said, "I never knew
[1:28:46] Jesus." Blankety blank blank.
[1:28:49] And after Jesus is resurrected, he tells
[1:28:52] him, "Go get my apostles. Tell them to
[1:28:54] meet me. And oh, by the way, tell Peter
[1:28:56] to come, too." Peter got a specific
[1:29:00] individual invitation to come back,
[1:29:04] even after what he did.
[1:29:06] You know, when Peter was at the at the
[1:29:07] tomb, he probably said, "Well, even if
[1:29:09] he is alive, he's never going to want to
[1:29:11] see my sorry face around here anymore.
[1:29:14] How about Saul who became Paul? My, you
[1:29:18] think about what he had to, you know,
[1:29:20] think about how the devil assaulted his
[1:29:22] mind of everything he had done before he
[1:29:26] was on the road to Damascus, before his
[1:29:29] eyes were open. He was baptized
[1:29:33] said, "Ananas, I want you to go and and
[1:29:35] go meet that guy, Saul." And Ananas
[1:29:38] said, "Lord," he said, "I've heard about
[1:29:39] that guy. He's a dangerous dude. I've
[1:29:42] heard about all the things that he has
[1:29:44] done to the believers. And G and the
[1:29:46] Lord said, "Don't worry, he's praying.
[1:29:48] If anybody w if anybody ever was
[1:29:50] praying, it was Saul." Cuz I believe
[1:29:52] that God walked around in his mind while
[1:29:55] he was in that prison cell. He was
[1:29:57] wounded for our transgression, you know,
[1:29:59] and and I believe that God started
[1:30:01] showing Saul and and and here's Saul
[1:30:04] saying, "Oh my God," he said, "No man in
[1:30:08] the history of the world is in more
[1:30:10] trouble than I am. Yeah,
[1:30:12] because I have been I have been
[1:30:14] aggressively and violently
[1:30:17] beating the followers of God.
[1:30:20] And now I'm blind.
[1:30:21] Now I'm in this room and Ananas come
[1:30:25] knocking on the door.
[1:30:27] Baptizes him, fills with the Holy Ghost,
[1:30:30] goes tries to preach, not much success.
[1:30:32] Goes out, takes all the types, gets all
[1:30:35] the books, gets all the messages, starts
[1:30:37] studying them. three years and finally
[1:30:40] he's ready, willing, and able. He's
[1:30:42] prepared. He knows that my God is in
[1:30:45] time, on time, all the time. And it's my
[1:30:48] time right now. It's my time to go. And
[1:30:50] and and Paul's own words were, he said,
[1:30:53] "I'm not even worthy to be called an
[1:30:55] apostle because I persecuted the church,
[1:30:58] but by the grace of God, I have an
[1:31:01] inheritance."
[1:31:02] Oh my God, an inheritance. Think about
[1:31:05] all the people down through the seven
[1:31:07] church ages. Think about, you know, the
[1:31:10] first person
[1:31:12] that ever experienced the third pull.
[1:31:15] The first one,
[1:31:17] you know who it was?
[1:31:20] It was the thief on the cross.
[1:31:23] First one to experience the third pole.
[1:31:26] He's there. He's a few moments or maybe
[1:31:29] an hour or so away from death and
[1:31:31] eternal separation from God. and he
[1:31:34] deserves what he's getting,
[1:31:35] right?
[1:31:36] And he looks over and God quickens him
[1:31:40] of who that is. He said, "Lord, remember
[1:31:42] me when you come, you come into your
[1:31:44] king." He said, "This day thou shalt be
[1:31:46] with me in paradise."
[1:31:48] What happened? He was quickened.
[1:31:51] I wonder, are we quickened? Right.
[1:31:54] You know, sometimes I go to a church, I
[1:31:56] don't get a lot of amens,
[1:31:58] don't see a lot of hands up.
[1:32:00] Don't hear a lot of praise the Lord.
[1:32:02] And sometimes I think I'm now not here.
[1:32:05] Not here. Don't don't don't take. But
[1:32:07] sometimes I think I'm speaking to the
[1:32:09] chosen frozen.
[1:32:13] And every once in a while, you know,
[1:32:14] it's like a corpse is there. Every once
[1:32:16] in a while, you say something. Oh, like
[1:32:18] there's been a quivering of the corpse,
[1:32:21] but no real movement yet. See, chosen,
[1:32:25] frozen, and now we come down to you and
[1:32:27] I, I'm closing all my books. We come
[1:32:30] down to you and I struggling
[1:32:34] struggling with the fact that out of all
[1:32:37] the billions of people in the world that
[1:32:41] God had chosen me, God has looked over
[1:32:46] all the big and mighty theologians.
[1:32:50] All these guys that got all their DDs
[1:32:52] and doubleldds and QUSDs. You know what
[1:32:55] I got? I got a justification degree.
[1:32:59] That's right.
[1:32:59] If you had a justification degree and
[1:33:02] Jesus came and he signed that with
[1:33:04] blood, you'd hang it somewhere close by
[1:33:06] in your house.
[1:33:08] That would be a treasure to you, a
[1:33:10] justification degree signed with the
[1:33:13] blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:33:16] So that's our struggle.
[1:33:17] Amen.
[1:33:18] That's our struggle to possess our
[1:33:21] inheritance,
[1:33:23] not a portion of it. It's not an
[1:33:25] inheritance, you know, well, you're
[1:33:26] going to get uh you're going to get so
[1:33:28] many promises this year and then so many
[1:33:30] promises next. It's not portioned out
[1:33:33] over, you know, a 20 or 30-year period
[1:33:35] like some wills when they read the will.
[1:33:37] You when you're 25 years old and if
[1:33:40] you're married and if you have children,
[1:33:43] then you then you can inherit what your
[1:33:45] father has left you. And that's not the
[1:33:47] kind of father we have, friends.
[1:33:49] That's not the kind of will he's left.
[1:33:51] That's not the kind of inheritance he's
[1:33:53] left.
[1:33:55] And all he asks us is only believe.
[1:34:00] Only, you know, that's hard some for
[1:34:02] some people.
[1:34:03] Some people they can't get by their
[1:34:06] guilt and their shame and their
[1:34:09] condemnation and their regret
[1:34:12] and they allow, you know, they're like a
[1:34:14] boxer. like a boxer, you know, and the
[1:34:16] boxer's in there and the guy's there and
[1:34:18] he's still on his feet, but the other
[1:34:20] boxer punch punch punch punch punch and
[1:34:23] the guy's just reeling trying. He like
[1:34:25] like that movie a long time ago, Rocky.
[1:34:28] You know, Rocky should have been down 15
[1:34:30] times on the camp, but he just stayed up
[1:34:32] and he stayed up and he stayed up.
[1:34:34] That's how some believers are. Satan
[1:34:36] beats him up. Beats him up. Beats him
[1:34:38] up. Oh, you know, I still think I still
[1:34:41] think that God loves me. I I Right?
[1:34:44] They got to inherit the promises.
[1:34:47] They got to come, you know what you got
[1:34:48] to do with the devil? You got to hit him
[1:34:50] with so many rights. He'll beg for a
[1:34:52] left.
[1:34:53] That's what you got to do.
[1:34:55] You got to hit him with all the
[1:34:56] promises. And finally, thus sayeth the
[1:34:58] Lord, finish them off. Let's stand to
[1:35:00] our feet, friends.
[1:35:05] What an inheritance
[1:35:07] we have got.
[1:35:10] And we've got a passion to know God. and
[1:35:13] serve God and love God. The musicians
[1:35:16] can come. God bless you.
[1:35:19] We got to focus like a laser beam
[1:35:22] on the promises of God.
[1:35:24] And and if God said it, you can believe
[1:35:27] it's for you. It's for me, too, but it's
[1:35:30] for you, too.
[1:35:31] Amen.
[1:35:33] Thank you, Lord.
[1:35:36] Thank you.
[1:35:38] Let's sing Amazing Grace because truly
[1:35:42] that's what each one of us our
[1:35:43] inheritance is because of Amazing Grace.
[1:35:47] God allowing us to read between the
[1:35:49] lines.
[1:35:52] You know, Brother Brandham said one
[1:35:53] time, and I I had read the seals, and I
[1:35:56] believed every bit of the seals, but
[1:35:59] then I went back to read a message, and
[1:36:01] the first the first few words of the the
[1:36:05] paragraph was, "Now remember, the seals
[1:36:09] are not open." I said, "What? I've been
[1:36:13] taught that they were open." But brother
[1:36:15] Ram says the seals are not open
[1:36:19] to the public,
[1:36:20] right?
[1:36:21] But they are open to the private
[1:36:25] guardianship and love of the bride of
[1:36:27] Jesus Christ. That's who the promises
[1:36:30] are open to. That's who the seals are
[1:36:33] open to.
[1:36:35] All the messages are yay and amen. My
[1:36:38] inheritance is yay and amen.
[1:36:41] Let's sing Amazing Grace. Amazing
[1:36:46] [Music]
[1:36:48] grace,
[1:36:50] how sweet
[1:36:53] the sound
[1:36:55] that save.
[1:36:57] [Music]
[1:37:01] Like me, like me, Lord, like me.
[1:37:07] I
[1:37:10] was was lost
[1:37:12] but now
[1:37:15] on fire
[1:37:18] [Music]
[1:37:21] but now
[1:37:24] I see.
[1:37:25] Hold on just just just for a moment. I
[1:37:28] want everybody to please close your
[1:37:31] eyes,
[1:37:32] bow your head. And my eyes are closed
[1:37:36] also. and they won't be open until I ask
[1:37:38] brother Sam to come and take take the
[1:37:41] rest of this service.
[1:37:43] But I want to ask you today
[1:37:47] if you're ready and willing and able to
[1:37:50] say to the Lord, "Father, I have heard
[1:37:55] that you left me an inheritance before
[1:37:58] the foundation of the world, and perhaps
[1:38:01] I have not been able to possess,
[1:38:05] take title, title deed, and claim it as
[1:38:08] my own. But today, Lord, I'm ready for
[1:38:12] things to change. I'm ready for my
[1:38:15] mindset to change. I'm ready for my
[1:38:17] hearts set to change. Lord,
[1:38:20] I'm ready to believe and manifest the
[1:38:23] promises that you have given to me. As
[1:38:26] all eyes are closed, heads bowed, how
[1:38:28] many would just lift your hand and say,
[1:38:30] "Lord, that's me."
[1:38:31] And I'll tell you friends, both my hands
[1:38:33] are up. Both my hands are up. God bless
[1:38:36] you. I'm going to ask brother Sam to
[1:38:38] come and ask him to pray for those who
[1:38:41] have raised their hand. And God bless
[1:38:43] you. And I appreciate it if you would
[1:38:46] remember me in prayer for the service
[1:38:48] this afternoon that that I'll be able to
[1:38:51] to finish the rest of what God has laid
[1:38:53] on my heart. God bless you.
[1:38:55] Amen.
[1:38:57] God bless you, Brother Sam.
[1:39:00] Oh my. I love you.
[1:39:02] Oh, sure. Pray for everybody.
[1:39:08] Father just
[1:39:17] love you and
[1:39:20] all my
[1:39:23] [Music]
[1:39:30] praise.
[1:39:34] Anybody

[1:39:43] be prayed for?
[1:39:44] [Music]
[1:39:54] Anybody

[1:40:24] will live
[1:40:27] in your home
[1:40:32] when we
[1:40:36] [Music]
[1:40:38] [Applause]
[1:40:43] try.
[1:40:45] [Music]
[1:40:47] Anybody else have a need?
[1:40:52] Oh, we know
[1:40:56] that
[1:40:58] to sing
[1:41:01] God's praise
[1:41:03] and
[1:41:06] we worship
[1:41:09] God.
[1:41:10] Amen and amen and amen. You enjoy the
[1:41:13] message. Let's give our brother a good
[1:41:15] amen.
[1:41:17] We believe it, right? I believe it.
[1:41:20] Amen. As our brother said, we just pray
[1:41:23] for everybody. And as we're dismissing,
[1:41:25] we just pray one for the other. All of
[1:41:27] us pray because my hands was the first
[1:41:30] one to up. I need it. We need God to
[1:41:32] lead us and direct us and keep us
[1:41:35] because if it's not in him anyway, we
[1:41:37] we're just might as well forget it. But
[1:41:40] in him, we have all things.
[1:41:42] Hallelujah.
[1:41:43] Through Christ that strengthen us. Amen.
[1:41:46] tell our brother how much you appreciate
[1:41:47] the message and then be with us this
[1:41:49] afternoon. If not, then pray for us. The
[1:41:51] Lord will bless. Okay. Father,
[1:41:55] we thank you for the message that we've
[1:41:57] heard today and we believe it.
[1:42:00] And Father, we just
[1:42:03] do as our brother said. We just pray for
[1:42:05] everybody that we all had our hands up.
[1:42:07] We all need more of you, Lord. We all
[1:42:10] need things to move in our lives to
[1:42:12] direct us and have a supernatural
[1:42:17] dealing with you, Lord, because nothing
[1:42:19] is natural with you. It's all
[1:42:21] supernatural.
[1:42:22] So, we thank you and we ask you to just
[1:42:25] bless each hand that went up.
[1:42:28] Behind that hand was a heart was raising
[1:42:30] to you. So, Lord, as we sing when we
[1:42:33] start, open the eyes of our heart that
[1:42:36] we may see you. Now we ask you to just
[1:42:40] bless each one that would be as we go on
[1:42:43] through the day that we'd remember that
[1:42:45] we raised our hands to you to commit
[1:42:48] oursel to you in a surrender of all
[1:42:51] things. We love you and we thank you.
[1:42:54] Just bless brother Ernie as he meditates
[1:42:57] to speak to us this afternoon
[1:42:59] and just help him and guide him. Give
[1:43:01] him strength. We love you and we thank
[1:43:03] you in Jesus name.
[1:43:06] Amen. You dismiss men.
[1:43:13] It's going to be a meeting in the air in
[1:43:19] the sweet, sweet by and by.
[1:43:24] And I'm going to meet you, meet you over
[1:43:28] there in that home beyond the sky.
[1:43:34] That singing you will hear never heard
[1:43:38] my voice will be glorious as I
[1:43:46] know you will be living.
