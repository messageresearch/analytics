[14:42] God lord I pray that that as time goes
[14:45] forward Lord God and as as as we
[14:48] progress in into this year Lord Jesus we
[14:51] ask heavenly father that you'd help us

[15:14] where this this this uh Capstone
[15:17] heavenly father has to come down
[15:19] heavenly father and this thing is narrow
[15:21] narrowing down lord Jesus and and those
[15:24] that are truly in Father God those that

[16:09] we ask these things now in Jesus
[16:11] Christ's name amen amen praise God if
[16:14] you want to turn to the scriptures this
[16:15] morning this evening let's turn to
[16:17] Joshua chapter
[16:19] 3 and uh and uh verse one we'll read
[16:24] first five verses there and then we'll
[16:26] want we want to turn to um Ephesians
[16:29] chap 4 verse
[16:32] 7 Joshua chapter 3 and it says and
[16:37] Joshua Rose early in the morning and
[16:39] they removed from sham and came to
[16:42] Jordan he and all the children of Israel
[16:45] and lodged there before they passed over
[16:48] and they came to pass after three days
[16:51] and it's interesting that that it gives
[16:53] it after three days you know what
[16:54] happened after three days when Jesus was
[16:56] in the Tomb amen he rose after 3 days uh
[17:00] it represents a lot with e eternal life
[17:02] you know and and uh and and it TI tied
[17:05] in with the number eight and things like
[17:07] that so that the officers went through
[17:10] the host and they commanded the people
[17:13] saying when ye see when ye see the Ark
[17:17] of the Covenant of the Lord your God and
[17:18] the priests the Levites bearing it then
[17:21] you shall remove from your place and go
[17:24] after it all right notice that it says
[17:28] go after it it yet there shall be a
[17:31] space between you and it about 2,000
[17:36] cubits by measure which is uh about a
[17:39] half a mile come not near unto it that
[17:44] ye may know watch the reason why that ye
[17:47] may know the way by which ye must go for
[17:52] ye have not passed this way here to for
[17:56] in other words you have not been this
[17:57] way before so you need to keep your eyes
[18:00] fixed on that Ark and Joshua said unto
[18:03] the people Joshua said unto the people
[18:05] remember Joshua represented the Holy
[18:07] Ghost amen and Joshua said unto the
[18:09] people sanctify yourselves for tomorrow
[18:14] tomorrow amen the Lord will do wonders
[18:18] among you amen praise the Lord now let's
[18:21] turn to Ephesians chapter 4 verse
[18:25] 7
[18:27] amen but unto every one of us is given
[18:31] Grace according to the measure of the
[18:33] gift of Christ so each one of us plays a
[18:36] role in the body of Christ as as it
[18:39] tells us right there amen wherefore he
[18:42] Seth when he ascended up on high he led
[18:47] captivity captive he's talking about
[18:48] Jesus Christ and gave gifts unto man now
[18:54] now that he ascended what is it but that
[18:57] he also descended at first into the
[19:00] lower parts of the Earth all right he
[19:03] that is he that descended is the same
[19:06] also that ascended up far above all
[19:09] Heavens amen that he might fill all
[19:13] things thank God amen amen I'm part of
[19:16] those things you'd be you're part of
[19:18] those
[19:19] things and he gave some Apostles and
[19:23] some prophets and some evangelists and
[19:28] some pastors and teachers all
[19:32] right notice a conjunction there pastors
[19:35] and teachers that's right right that's
[19:37] very interesting all right for the
[19:40] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[19:44] the ministry for the edifying of the
[19:47] body of Christ that's the reason why he
[19:50] gave these this five-fold ministry right
[19:52] till till until we all come into the
[19:56] unity of the faith all right right right
[20:00] that's very very key and that's what I
[20:02] want to I want to stress this in this
[20:04] hour until we come to the unity all
[20:07] right Unity comes from the
[20:10] word uh one amen which means Union right
[20:14] just one one one unit am right and of
[20:18] the knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[20:21] perfect man unto the measure of the
[20:25] stature of the fullness of Christ amen
[20:29] and watch this is this is the reason
[20:32] that we henceforth be no more
[20:35] children amen amen no more children
[20:38] right tossed to and fro and carried
[20:42] about with every wind of Doctrine or
[20:46] just anything that anybody says is
[20:49] influencing you right we we're not to be
[20:52] that way anymore by the slight of man
[20:55] what is slight by the trickiness of man
[20:58] and cunning craftiness whereby they lie
[21:02] in weight to
[21:04] deceive right but speaking watch this
[21:07] but speaking the truth in love amen May
[21:12] grow you may grow up into him in all
[21:16] things this is not a partial possession
[21:19] amen of of The Inheritance this is a

[25:44] Abraham he had G been given a promise uh
[25:47] to that they were going to possess a
[25:49] land amen and that promise when God says
[25:52] something Saints amen he's going to
[25:54] fulfill his word amen he doesn't say
[25:56] anything just to fill space
[25:59] he doesn't say anything amen he is not a
[26:01] one that lies he's not like you and I
[26:03] amen he's amen he keeps his word I'm so
[26:07] thankful for that that we have a word
[26:09] amen in this hour that's true amen
[26:11] that's alive amen that's the that's the
[26:13] that's the best thing of all it's a
[26:15] living word in this hour and that word
[26:17] was given to to to uh Abraham and
[26:21] Abraham all he had to do was just
[26:22] continue walking in that amen he didn't
[26:25] know when it was going to come to pass
[26:27] he didn't he was he was told that his
[26:29] his seed shall possess the gates of his
[26:32] enemy that he would his seed would be
[26:34] like the stars of of the sky the sand on
[26:37] on the shore and all these things he
[26:39] didn't know when that was going to
[26:40] happen but all he had to do was continue
[26:43] walking day by day oh Saints we we got
[26:46] so many wonderful promises in the word
[26:48] in this hour amen and sometimes we
[26:51] wondering well what's going to happen
[26:52] here what's going to happen this what's
[26:54] going on right here what's happening
[26:55] that amen just keep walking in what you
[26:57] have right right now stay with what you
[27:00] have right now amen that's all Abraham
[27:03] could do was just walk in what he had at
[27:05] the moment amen and then as he continued
[27:08] to walk the Lord would reveal more to
[27:10] him and just keep walking Abraham just
[27:12] keep walking I am the one I am God I I
[27:16] am I this ien amen I like what brother
[27:18] Wade was one of the things that we were
[27:20] telling the he was preaching there to
[27:21] the people in Honduras amen was that God
[27:24] was telling Abraham that he was the one
[27:26] who was going to keep the promise amen
[27:29] not Abraham amen it was it was an
[27:32] unconditional uh Covenant amen and so
[27:34] that mean Abraham was the one I mean
[27:36] that God was the one who was going to
[27:38] fulfill that word amen oh I'm so
[27:40] thankful amen that's under the Covenant
[27:42] that we're living in in this hour that
[27:43] God is going to fulfill it amen praise
[27:45] the Lord Jesus amen you do your part
[27:48] amen your part to believe God will do
[27:50] the rest amen and that just keep walking
[27:52] in what he's already given you now well
[27:54] I don't know about the seals and I don't
[27:56] know about Daniel 7 we keep walking with
[27:58] what you got right now amen God will
[28:01] lead you exactly to that point amen just
[28:03] stay with what you have now amen that's
[28:05] all God requires you to do amen stay in
[28:08] the word that you have right now amen
[28:11] don't get so fixated and it's very
[28:14] important that we get more word but the
[28:16] more word that you receive is is is is
[28:18] if you're walking in the word that you
[28:20] already have amen you'll receive more
[28:22] word if you keep walking in the word
[28:24] amen each step that you take it's a
[28:26] present step amen you if you take that
[28:29] step then you'll get to the next step
[28:31] you see amen so you have to keep walking
[28:33] that way and it was given to the to
[28:35] Abraham that they will have a land amen
[28:38] praise God to possess amen and the
[28:40] children of Israel finally that that
[28:42] promise amen because remember God
[28:44] doesn't lie that PR same promise came
[28:46] through Moses amen and Moses was told
[28:49] amen that that there was his people were
[28:52] going to possess a land praise God that
[28:54] that was flowing with milk and honey
[28:56] Moses didn't know how it was going to
[28:57] happen
[28:58] amen but eventually he was the one to
[29:01] lead the children of Israel out of Egypt
[29:03] and we all know the story we all know
[29:05] what happened amen it came to the point
[29:07] where that original generation amen all
[29:11] of them pretty much passed away that's
[29:13] right they did not make it to see the
[29:15] Promise amen but there was the second
[29:18] generation that rose up amen oh my we
[29:21] see a second generation rising up in
[29:24] this hour amen we see we see a people
[29:27] amen that are about Amen to see This
[29:30] Promise fulfilled Amen in their very own
[29:32] lives amen I believe that somebody's
[29:35] going to fulfill amen first
[29:36] Thessalonians praise God Amen wa who do
[29:40] those who are alive and remain shall not
[29:42] prevent those amen who are asleep praise
[29:44] God and somebody's going to see a body
[29:46] change I just I might as well believe
[29:49] it's me amen praise God and you might as
[29:51] well just believe it's you because we're
[29:53] living in that hour amen praise God
[29:55] where those Saints amen they shall rise
[29:57] praise praise God and then we will be
[29:59] caught up with them amen to meet Jesus
[30:01] in the air amen I always stress that
[30:04] promise because that is something that
[30:05] yet hasn't been fulfilled but I believe
[30:07] it's working in this hour amen praise
[30:10] God and somebody's got to fulfill it
[30:12] Amen brother brandom couldn't do it amen
[30:14] not even Jesus could do it amen praise
[30:17] God somebody's going to have a body
[30:19] change while they're alive amen
[30:22] somebody's not going to see death praise
[30:24] God Amen oh I'm so thankful for that
[30:26] Amen in this hour amen praise God and so
[30:29] here's the children of Israel and
[30:30] they're getting ready to cross over into
[30:32] Canaan praise God and so right as there
[30:34] before they they're getting ready AC
[30:36] cross we know in in in chapter two that
[30:39] that Joshua sent the two spies and uh
[30:41] Rahab was on the scene there and and we
[30:44] know what happened there and they came
[30:45] back praise God knowing that God was
[30:48] going to give them that that land amen
[30:50] those two spies were giving positive
[30:53] confession amen even Rahab knew that
[30:56] that land was theirs am she said for we
[30:59] know we know that when you come in amen
[31:02] we know that this land is yours we know
[31:04] that God has already given you this land
[31:06] and she did everything that she could to
[31:09] try to make sure her family was able to
[31:11] get in amen praise God she did all that
[31:14] she could Amen to make sure that her
[31:16] family was saved and that she was saved
[31:18] that she had that token ready amen ready
[31:20] to go out ready to show it amen praise
[31:22] God because Joshua was coming through
[31:24] amen and he better see that token
[31:26] Hallelujah that's right amen praise God
[31:29] that's the reason why Joshua wasn't with
[31:31] the two spies amen but when he saw that
[31:34] token he said he told the two spies he
[31:36] said go get Rahab amen and he he made
[31:39] sure personally to go get Rahab amen
[31:42] praise God oh this in this hour Saints
[31:45] amen God's going to personally make sure
[31:47] that this bride is is protected in this
[31:49] hour amen that he'll have a bride amen
[31:51] without spot or wrinkle praise the Lord
[31:55] oh my thank God amen amen so here they
[31:58] are here at the border of of the of of
[32:01] of crossing over into Canaan and we know
[32:03] that Canaan Canaan represents amen the
[32:06] the the life in the holy spirit amen uh
[32:09] I know sometimes people call it as
[32:11] Heaven amen but brother brandham said
[32:13] that you know it to him it wasn't Heaven
[32:15] because when they crossed over into
[32:17] Canaan they still had to fight they
[32:19] still had battles they still had things
[32:21] that they had to face praise God and
[32:23] brother brandom actually typed the Book
[32:25] of Joshua with the book of Ephesians
[32:27] which is which is uh uh the the the Book
[32:30] of Joshua the main theme of the book of
[32:32] Joshua is possession amen praise God and
[32:36] if you look here in in in Ephesians
[32:38] chapter 1 verse four verse 13 uh if you
[32:41] want to read with me there those those
[32:43] who if you have your the word it says
[32:46] here in
[32:48] whom well let's read from verse 12 that
[32:50] we should be to the praise of his glory
[32:53] who first trusted in Christ in whom ye
[32:56] also trusted after that ye heard the
[32:59] word of Truth The Gospel of your
[33:02] salvation in whom also after ye believed
[33:05] you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of
[33:08] Promise oh my thank God for his holy
[33:11] spirit amen watch this in verse 14 which
[33:14] is the earnest of our inheritance in
[33:17] other words which is the down payment of
[33:20] of what God has already purchased for
[33:22] you amen and do you realize that the
[33:24] children of Israel that land was already
[33:26] theirs all they had to do was just go
[33:29] and possess it amen all they had to do
[33:32] is just get up amen and just go in and
[33:34] possess what God has given them praise
[33:37] God God the Holy Ghost is yours Saints
[33:39] amen healing is yours amen all these
[33:42] blessings all these promises from God
[33:44] they are yours in this hour amen because
[33:46] they belong to his wife amen and if you
[33:49] are part of him amen praise God they
[33:51] belong to you hallelujah praise God
[33:55] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[33:57] until watch this until the Redemption of
[34:01] the purchased possession amen praise God
[34:06] it and I like I like the way it says it
[34:08] in the past purchased amen but we must
[34:12] it's already yours right praise God but
[34:15] we must continue on Amen until the
[34:18] Redemption of the purchased possession
[34:20] what purchase possession amen the
[34:21] children of Israel had that land the
[34:23] physical land we got to purchase
[34:25] possession to amen that we're looking to
[34:27] Amen to also overcome as well
[34:30] amen amen put unto the praise of his
[34:34] glory now so the children of Israel when
[34:36] they crossed over and eventually we'll
[34:38] read it here they had to fight after
[34:40] that because right right after that was
[34:43] Jericho they had to go in even though
[34:46] God had told them and they knew the two
[34:49] spies had already told them even Rahab
[34:52] amen had said that that land is yours
[34:54] that that city is yours God has given
[34:56] you amen but the children of Israel had
[34:59] to obey the word praise God the children
[35:02] of Israel had to obey and had to go
[35:04] physically possessed amen and this sour
[35:07] Saints amen it's not enough amen that
[35:09] you just know it it's not enough that
[35:11] you just know go and possess in this
[35:14] hour praise God how how am I going to
[35:16] possess how am I going to get amen
[35:18] you're going to have
[35:20] trials oh I know we don't like to hear
[35:23] that we don't like we don't like to hear
[35:26] that word a trials you know we don't
[35:29] like to hear uh problems come up amen
[35:32] because because well that's problematic
[35:35] to hear those
[35:37] words we don't like that but that's what
[35:40] molds us that's what that's what molds
[35:43] our character that's what that's what
[35:45] that's what actually draws us closer to
[35:48] God Amen puts us on our knees amen and
[35:51] and makes us pray and makes us seek him
[35:53] more Amen in this hour praise the Lord
[35:56] sometimes amen God has to amen cause
[35:59] friction amongst the Brethren amen for
[36:02] them to realize amen I need that person
[36:05] really that person probably needs me too
[36:09] amen and he might cause friction amen
[36:11] and you might think I I don't I could
[36:13] Google I could do away with that person
[36:14] amen but you really need that person
[36:16] that's right brother brandham said that
[36:18] if a brother or sister amen that you
[36:20] have ought with if he passed he or she
[36:23] passed away you would feel so bad in
[36:25] your heart if you truly are a Christian
[36:28] amen and so this is what we're talking
[36:30] about this is what Ephesians deals with
[36:32] these little things that we leave undone
[36:35] and we think we're okay we think that
[36:37] it's okay Amen to just go in life and go
[36:40] to church not talk to anybody and just
[36:42] have just just just go and and and just
[36:45] have a with people who just wherever we
[36:47] want to amen and smart off at people and
[36:50] say I know y'all start getting quiet
[36:53] when we start talking like this but this
[36:55] is how it is and it's just it's okay to
[36:58] just go to church and just be that way
[37:00] amen and just to treat people however
[37:02] way it is I'm not saying anybody here
[37:04] specifically they do that amen CU I I've
[37:07] been there too sometimes you get
[37:09] attitudes with people and you get and
[37:11] you get things amen that that that in
[37:14] reality then you go back and sit down
[37:15] you think about it and you're like I
[37:17] really shouldn't have thought that way I
[37:19] really shouldn't have said that I really
[37:20] shouldn't have have acted that way amen
[37:23] praise God I'm so thankful amen that a
[37:25] true Christian thinks like that amen
[37:27] amen but if you don't feel anything when
[37:29] you do something to somebody or somebody
[37:31] amen if you don't feel that way go check
[37:33] up it's time to check up amen if you
[37:36] feel like well I'm just kind of better
[37:38] than them and I'll just you know you
[37:40] know something's wrong with you
[37:42] something's wrong with your experience
[37:44] amen so I don't even know how I got into
[37:49] that somebody must have needed I I
[37:52] needed
[37:53] it but that's the hour that we're living
[37:56] in Saints right we need to check our
[37:59] individual these things that would that
[38:01] that that that we leave undone sometimes
[38:04] amen praise God so here the children of
[38:06] Israel they were getting ready in go in
[38:08] to possess and the Bible says here in
[38:11] Joshua chapter 3 it says let's just read
[38:14] verse one again it says and Joshua Rose
[38:16] early in the morning and they removed
[38:18] from sham and came to Jordan he and all
[38:21] the children of Israel and lodged there
[38:23] before they passed over amen so they
[38:25] they they they they stationed for a
[38:28] while amen but they didn't put their
[38:30] Stakes
[38:31] down that's the important thing amen
[38:34] they they didn't they didn't they didn't
[38:37] have in mind that I'm going to put my
[38:38] steak down to be there forever amen
[38:41] sometimes God gives us a a time of of re
[38:44] rest relaxation and no
[38:48] problems amen but don't put your stake
[38:50] down on that and think that that's how
[38:52] life is going to be always some of you
[38:55] already know that that's not how it is
[38:57] amen we've all had problems in life and
[39:00] trials amen and you've come to realize
[39:02] that you can't have your Stak down in
[39:04] something amen and think that things are
[39:06] always going to be that way amen
[39:08] something's going to come in and just
[39:09] change it all up for you why for your
[39:11] own good for your own good because God
[39:15] knows amen that you can you can overcome
[39:18] amen otherwise he wouldn't give you that
[39:20] specific trial he knows that you can
[39:22] overcome that's the reason why you went
[39:24] through the trial or you're going
[39:26] through the trial amen
[39:27] praise God and it came to pass after
[39:30] three days that the officers went
[39:32] through the host amen and I I as I
[39:35] mentioned you know the the three days
[39:38] having to do with Resurrection eternal
[39:40] life amen you can just go look at that
[39:42] at your at your own time and they
[39:44] commanded they commanded the people
[39:46] saying when ye see the Ark of the
[39:48] Covenant of the Lord your God and the
[39:50] priests the Levites bearing it amen I
[39:53] want you to realize and and remember
[39:55] that the Ark of the Covenant amen
[39:56] represents the word amen amen because
[39:59] inside the Ark of the Covenant is where
[40:01] you had uh the the the Ten Commandments
[40:04] the uh the Aaron's rod and they also
[40:07] would put the Mana in there as well the
[40:10] original Mana that fell amen the first
[40:12] time when the children of Israel were in
[40:14] the wilderness so it was a very it
[40:16] represented God's presence amen amen
[40:19] that's where God was dwelling at the
[40:21] moment amen and so it was very important
[40:24] amen that they that the children of
[40:26] Israel watch watch the way it says it
[40:29] amen and the priests the Levites bearing
[40:31] it that ye shall remove from your place
[40:33] and go after it amen amen who was the
[40:37] one bearing the the the the the Ark of
[40:39] the Covenant it was the Levites or the
[40:41] fivefold ministry of that day amen
[40:45] praise God you have to make sure amen
[40:47] and recognize amen there's a five-fold
[40:49] ministry that's holding the Ark of the
[40:52] Covenant in this hour praise the Lord
[40:54] amen that have been given have been in
[40:56] in trusted with that amen praise God but
[41:00] you are to look at the Ark of the
[41:01] Covenant and not at the five-fold
[41:03] ministry amen you're supposed to look at
[41:06] the word not supposed to look at the man
[41:09] amen and we're going to read something
[41:10] here in just a moment amen yet there
[41:13] shall be a space between you and it
[41:16] about 2,000 cubits by measure come not
[41:20] near unto it that ye may know that you
[41:22] may know the way by which you must go
[41:26] amen for ye have not passed this way
[41:28] here to for Saints amen and and I just
[41:31] want to encourage you that in this in
[41:33] this in this year amen this New Year
[41:35] pray if you could just call it a New
[41:36] Year's New Year's uh uh uh sermon amen
[41:40] we have not been this way before Saints
[41:42] right amen we have not we have not this
[41:45] is we have never been a 2025 amen we
[41:48] have never experienced even some of the
[41:50] things that we are seeing now we have
[41:51] never experienced it before amen but you
[41:55] have not been this way before but you
[41:57] you need someone to Lead You In This
[41:58] Hour amen you need someone amen you need
[42:02] to get into the plan of God Amen and
[42:05] watch that word amen and let the word
[42:07] guide your thinking in this hour amen
[42:09] because if it doesn't guide your
[42:11] thinking amen someone else will guide
[42:13] your thinking amen someone else will
[42:16] have your thought process amen and
[42:18] someone else and it it'll be nothing but
[42:20] the devil because that's what the devil
[42:22] wants to do amen and so you got to make
[42:24] sure that you keep your eyes focused on
[42:27] the word amen the word is the most
[42:29] important thing in this hour and if it
[42:31] doesn't say it amen if the word doesn't
[42:33] say it make just leave it alone amen it
[42:35] may not be bad amen it may not be
[42:38] something bad but if it doesn't say it
[42:40] if it doesn't align with God's plan from
[42:43] Genesis to Revelation amen leave it
[42:45] alone it's the best thing to do amen
[42:47] amen it may not be necessarily bad thing
[42:51] it can't be just for you amen but if it
[42:53] doesn't allign with the word leave it
[42:55] alone amen that's the best advice I
[42:57] could give on on on that because we're
[42:59] seeing so many things going on around us
[43:02] amen praise God and Joshua said unto the
[43:05] people verse 5 and Joshua said unto the
[43:08] people sanctify yourselves for tomorrow
[43:11] the Lord will do wonders among you amen
[43:14] so even though they were with Joshua
[43:16] even though they had the word the
[43:18] message for their day the word of the
[43:21] hour amen Joshua the leader was there
[43:24] with them the Holy Ghost amen they still
[43:27] have to sanctify themselves amen I
[43:30] believe in this hour amen that you still
[43:31] have to repent I believe in this hour
[43:34] that you still have to and make sure
[43:35] look at your life see what I can clean
[43:37] off of me amen see what I what what am I
[43:40] doing wrong where am I failing you Lord
[43:41] amen you might have been in this word
[43:43] amen for 50 years amen you still might
[43:46] be failing in in an area amen find out
[43:49] amen there might be things in your life
[43:51] amen because let me tell you we've never
[43:53] been this way before you better make
[43:55] sure you're walking in the word amen you
[43:57] better make sure that you're walking
[43:59] fully in in in in Christ and know where
[44:01] you're standing in this word amen praise
[44:03] God so sanctification is not just a one
[44:07] time thing amen sanctification is a
[44:09] whole process amen throughout the whole
[44:12] amen life of a Christian amen praise God
[44:15] Amen I believe that we're still learning
[44:17] and and and and
[44:19] recognizing this is probably not good
[44:21] for me to continue doing this is
[44:23] probably not good for me to continue
[44:25] watching on this is probably not good
[44:28] for me to continue listening to right

[49:16] hour this day will I I Lord himself

[50:16] the Lord amen that Holy Ghost amen he
[50:19] said that he'd be with you even in you
[50:21] Amen to the day to the end of the world
[50:23] praise the Lord and that's what he
[50:25] promised amen and I believe your Holy
[50:27] Ghost filled in this hour amen I believe
[50:29] that he's fulfilling that promise in
[50:30] your life at this very moment amen
[50:33] praise God oh my some people might have
[50:36] thought oh my when brother Brandon
[50:37] passed away that was it oh we don't
[50:40] we're just not not amen but the Holy
[50:42] Ghost never died and that message never
[50:44] died that message is still with us amen
[50:47] amen praise God I know that the
[50:48] messenger and the message are one amen
[50:50] but what was more important what I
[50:51] needed was that message amen praise God
[50:55] but that's that that just that just goes
[50:56] to show amen that that's that that you
[50:58] need also the messenger in order to have
[51:01] the message amen as we're going to read
[51:03] here in just a moment and the Lord said
[51:05] unto Joshua this day will I begin to
[51:07] magnify thee in the sight of all Israel
[51:09] that they may know that th as I was with
[51:11] Moses so I will be with thee and thou
[51:14] shalt command the priest this is still
[51:16] God speaking that thou shalt command the
[51:18] priest that bear the Ark of the Covenant
[51:20] saying when ye are come to the brink of
[51:22] the Jordan o of the water of Jordan ye
[51:25] shall stand still still in
[51:27] Jordan now I want you to realize saints
[51:30] that Jordan you know it represents many
[51:32] things it represents death it repres
[51:34] represented many things but this was a a
[51:37] river that the children of Israel had
[51:39] not ever
[51:40] crossed this is the first time that they
[51:43] had come to this point amen and I
[51:45] believe sometimes you know we it's the
[51:47] first time that we experience things in
[51:49] our life certain issues certain problems
[51:52] amen but if you just keep your eyes
[51:54] fixed on this word amen as God was
[51:57] telling the children of Israel or was
[51:59] telling Joshua to tell the people amen
[52:01] let them keep their eyes on the word the
[52:04] word will be able to guide them through
[52:05] those problems through that individual a
[52:08] remember problems don't have eternal
[52:11] life they have a beginning that means
[52:14] they have an End Amen praise
[52:18] God if they if they're there they were
[52:21] created whatever was created doesn't
[52:24] have eternal life amen praise God
[52:27] hallelujah and so God is the one who
[52:29] only have he's the source of eternal
[52:32] life and if you come from him amen
[52:34] praise God you have that same life
[52:36] Hallelujah so you're not a problem
[52:38] before
[52:39] God Amen you're his eternal attribute
[52:42] hallelujah praise God and Joshua said
[52:45] and thou shalt command the priest that
[52:47] bear the ark now watch what he says here
[52:48] in verse eight and thou shalt command
[52:50] the priest that bear the Ark of the
[52:51] Covenant saying when ye are come to the
[52:53] brink of the water of Jordan you shall
[52:55] stand still in the Jordan amen sometimes
[52:58] that's the best thing to do when
[52:59] problems come stand still and see the
[53:01] salvation of the Lord and Joshua said
[53:04] unto the children of Israel come hither
[53:06] amen come hither and hear the words of
[53:08] the Lord your God Amen and Joshua said
[53:11] hereby ye shall know this is the what
[53:14] you shall know that the Living God is
[53:16] among you amen and that he will without
[53:21] fail amen drive out from before you the
[53:24] hivites the the the the Canaanites and
[53:27] the Hittites and the hites and the
[53:29] parasites and the girgashites and the
[53:31] amorites and the jebusites praise God
[53:34] now we know what God had told the uh
[53:36] Joshua but but Joshua gave it a little
[53:38] bit more meaning Amen in some in some
[53:41] scriptures it says and and and Joshua
[53:43] added Amen in other words now we don't
[53:46] add to the word amen praise God we we
[53:49] continue we we preach what has already
[53:52] been preached amen I I don't I don't I
[53:54] don't have the word a word of my own
[53:56] brother Wade brother Bob brother Aaron
[53:58] don't have anything of their own amen
[54:00] that that will just make you just uh uh
[54:03] just oh and oh wow no we're just
[54:06] preaching the same thing the prophet
[54:08] preached amen the word amen praise God
[54:11] because we are we are ministers under
[54:13] the messenger amen praise the Lord Jesus
[54:16] but Joshua amen the Holy Ghost he added
[54:18] a little bit more to it amen and brother
[54:20] brandham said that in this hour amen
[54:23] that there will the the the ministry
[54:25] amen that five-fold Ministry we'll take
[54:26] the things that were said and we'll give
[54:28] it more meaning amen praise God Amen and
[54:31] that's very important in this hour amen
[54:33] praise the Lord because well that's the
[54:35] reason why we need a living present day
[54:37] Ministry amen praise God Amen the things
[54:41] amen what does it do you good young
[54:43] people if I talk about Elvis Presley it
[54:46] doesn't it's good to know amen the roots
[54:48] of that and and and and and and and the
[54:51] and and where rock and roll and all that
[54:53] start started happen it's good to start
[54:55] with Elvis Presley but I can't tell you
[54:57] amen don't listen to Elvis Presley cuz I
[54:59] know you ain't listening to Elvis
[55:00] Presley amen that's right amen you're

[55:14] I hope that you got Holy Ghost filled
[55:15] that that you're listening to Good
[55:17] gospel Christian music amen something
[55:19] that'll help you amen but but you see it
[55:22] doesn't benefit me Amen to speak about
[55:24] those things Amen to to you so you got
[55:26] to you got you have to have a five-fold
[55:28] Ministry to come down amen and and take
[55:30] those things that brother Bram said give
[55:32] it more meaning for in this hour amen
[55:35] praise the Lord Jesus and that's very
[55:36] very important amen because we're
[55:38] speaking to a
[55:39] multi-generational congregation amen
[55:42] sometimes we're just so fixated just say
[55:44] it the way the prophet said okay that's
[55:46] fine that's good but what did the
[55:48] prophet say let me take it so that I can
[55:50] put it into action in this day amen
[55:53] that's what the fful ministry is there
[55:55] for amen praise the Lord so it's taking
[55:58] the exact same thing that God said or
[56:00] the message says but added more meaning
[56:02] to our present day oh my praise the Lord
[56:05] that's what we need amen you need to
[56:07] pray for the fivefold ministry amen so
[56:10] that they could find the mind of God
[56:12] Amen and I don't want to know about all
[56:14] your problems and things like that amen
[56:17] I just want to be able to preach and and
[56:19] let God speak to your problem amen
[56:21] praise God cuz God's the one who knows I
[56:23] don't let God do it amen and he'll do it
[56:25] really good praise God Amen and Joshua
[56:29] said hereby ye shall know that the
[56:31] Living God Amen why it's because through
[56:33] a living Ministry is among you and that
[56:36] he will without fail drive out from
[56:38] before you and then all right we see
[56:40] that and um verse 11 behold now Joshua
[56:44] is still speaking behold the Ark of the
[56:46] Covenant of the Lord of all the Earth
[56:49] amen I like the way it says it there
[56:51] passeth over before you into Jordan amen
[56:55] now there therefore take you 12 men out
[56:58] of the tribes of Israel out of every
[57:00] tribe of man and it shall come to pass
[57:02] as soon as the souls of the feet of the
[57:03] priest that bear the Ark of the Lord the
[57:05] Lord of all the Earth shall rest in the
[57:08] waters of Jordan that the Waters of
[57:09] Jordan shall be cut off from the waters
[57:12] that come down from above and they shall
[57:15] stand upon an Heap amen the children of
[57:17] Israel in that hour Saints they had to
[57:19] listen to that and have faith in that
[57:23] word now put yourself in their in their
[57:25] in their I won't say shoes or sandals in
[57:28] that
[57:29] hour put yourself in their shoes in that
[57:32] hour you're sitting here listening to
[57:34] the man of the hour and he says that God
[57:37] spoke to him these things amen and that
[57:41] you you're getting ready to cross a
[57:42] treacherous River man because it was
[57:45] there there's certain times of the year
[57:47] where it was very treacherous to cross
[57:49] over that Jordan River amen and so
[57:52] anything could happen and there's a lot
[57:54] of people crossing over and you're
[57:56] listening amen and you have to you have
[58:00] to have faith that what Joshua is saying
[58:03] is helping you amen oh my amen and this
[58:06] hour sayings you have to have faith amen
[58:08] that what the PE some what's being said
[58:10] behind the pulpit is helping you in this
[58:12] hour that is the Holy Ghost and that
[58:15] it's not just the man or it's not just
[58:17] just just that brother or you know but
[58:20] it's God Amen speaking directly to you
[58:23] God knows your needs amen praise the
[58:25] Lord Jesus
[58:26] God knows exactly how to speak to the
[58:28] situation amen and so all this all this
[58:32] did not work amen to go and possess
[58:35] something did not work if Faith was not
[58:37] involved no right Faith had to be
[58:39] involved Saints amen so you have to have
[58:42] a level of faith in this hour amen that
[58:45] what's that that the word that's going
[58:48] through amen even the word that you
[58:49] listen to at home that the that the
[58:52] tapes amen and and even anything that
[58:54] you might listen to online amen Lord
[58:57] Jesus help me father to receive
[58:59] something that would speak to my need
[59:01] the word that you read amen if you take
[59:03] the word of God that way amen I
[59:05] guarantee you God will speak exactly
[59:06] what you need there's been many times
[59:08] where I have gotten the the Bible picked
[59:10] up the Bible and I said Lord you know my
[59:12] need you know that I have this issue and
[59:14] I just open up the word amen maybe I
[59:16] might not have a specific place that I
[59:18] uh that I I wanted to read just open up
[59:21] the and as soon as I open up it's right
[59:23] there the need my need met amen and I
[59:27] know that many of you have probably
[59:28] experienced the same thing amen you know

[59:32] like that remember when when uh or it
[59:34] was mey I was was Sister mey when when
[59:37] he said when she was uh I guess she was
[59:40] doubting or you know with regards to
[59:42] brother brandom and his ministry and and
[59:44] or or it was before they got married I
[59:46] believe it was it was before they got
[59:48] married and she was wanting to know the
[59:50] will of the Lord she wanted to know the
[59:52] will of the lord lord should I marry
[59:54] brother brandom you know I I do like him
[59:56] and I really but should I and she opened
[59:59] up the word and she opened up to Malachi
[1:00:01] chapter
[1:00:01] 4 behold I send you Elijah the prophet
[1:00:06] it was as simple as that amen now you go
[1:00:08] back in the tapes and listen brother
[1:00:10] brandom tells that story amen that was
[1:00:12] her that was her uh that was her
[1:00:14] confirmation so the Lord has a
[1:00:16] confirmation in the word for you in the
[1:00:18] messages in whatever amen praise

[1:00:45] in the brim of the water for Jordan
[1:00:47] overfloweth all his Banks all the time
[1:00:50] of harvest that the waters which came
[1:00:52] down from above stood and Rose up on and
[1:00:56] Heap very far from the city Adam that is
[1:00:58] beside zaratin and those that came down
[1:01:00] toward the Sea of the plain even the
[1:01:03] salt sea failed and were cut off and the
[1:01:05] people passed over right again Jericho
[1:01:09] amen amen exactly what the Lord told
[1:01:12] them through Joshua they took it by
[1:01:14] faith and they crossed
[1:01:17] over that that way that they never had
[1:01:19] been through before they did exactly
[1:01:23] what God told them to do keep your eyes
[1:01:25] fixed on the on on the word amen amen
[1:01:28] when you keep your eyes fixed on the
[1:01:29] word and take it in by faith you're
[1:01:31] going to be able to cross over you're
[1:01:34] going to get through your problem you're
[1:01:35] going to get through your issue and this
[1:01:38] verse 17 and the priest that bear the

[1:01:42] firm on dry ground in the midst of
[1:01:44] Jordan on dry ground you see God Amen

[1:01:48] in at the Red Sea with Moses and all the
[1:01:52] Israelites all not not one amen amen
[1:01:55] possession means amen a full amen
[1:01:58] something full amen nothing partly
[1:02:01] nothing half amen when a devil possesses
[1:02:03] someone that means it's taking full
[1:02:05] control right and that word possession
[1:02:08] means fullness right and that's what God
[1:02:11] wants Amen in this hour he wants full
[1:02:13] control in this hour amen that's and he
[1:02:16] wants you to take the promises his
[1:02:18] promises in full possession Amen in
[1:02:21] other words embrace them in this hour
[1:02:23] and don't let them go like Jacob said I
[1:02:26] will not let you go until you bless me
[1:02:28] amen until you meet my need and and and
[1:02:31] and and Jacob had a need in that hour
[1:02:33] amen and and he said I'm not letting go
