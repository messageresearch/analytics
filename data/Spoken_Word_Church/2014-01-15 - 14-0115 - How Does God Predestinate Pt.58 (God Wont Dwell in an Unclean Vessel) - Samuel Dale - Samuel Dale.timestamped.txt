[4:28] 28-31 now I want to if I can tonight I
[4:32] don't know I'll try to if I can maybe
[4:35] Sunday we'll be able to just
[4:38] scan through a message with very few
[4:40] quotes maybe and uh try to put down what
[4:44] we're talking about
[4:46] so that you can understand what we're
[4:48] saying you know and doing and then uh
[4:52] we'll try to maybe Sunday afternoon have
[4:55] questions and answers
[4:56] so if you have anything write it down
[4:58] we'll try to cover it
[5:00] and and you know try to be do as much as
[5:03] we can all right
[5:04] so just just do that
[5:07] Romans 8.
[5:11] and we know that all things work
[5:12] together for good to them that love God
[5:15] to them who are thee called according to
[5:17] his purpose for whom he did for no he
[5:19] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[5:21] the image of his son that he might be
[5:23] the firstborn among many Brethren or for
[5:26] whom he did predestinate them he also
[5:28] called in whom he called him he also
[5:31] just justified in whom he justified them
[5:34] he also glorified all already done as
[5:37] far as God is concerned
[5:40] but now as far as we're concerned we're
[5:42] still here in a journey right
[5:45] what shall we then say to these things
[5:47] if God be for us
[5:50] who can be against us we're now not
[5:51] memorized by now
[5:54] 58 times that we've read it so far first
[5:58] John 2
[5:59] .
[6:01] verse 15.
[6:03] love not the world neither the things
[6:05] that are in the world
[6:07] If any man love the world the love of
[6:10] the father is not in him
[6:12] for all that is in the world the lust of
[6:15] the flesh the lust of the eyes and the
[6:17] pride of life is not of the father but
[6:19] is of the world and he goes on to say
[6:22] verse 17 you can be seated it goes on to
[6:25] say but the world will pass away that's
[6:27] right all right
[6:28] now but to him that doeth the will of
[6:31] the father will abide all right now we
[6:34] know that
[6:36] when he's saying
[6:38] uh you know
[6:40] love of the world
[6:42] neither the things that are in the world
[6:44] he's not talking about life
[6:47] right
[6:49] and because we've got to live
[6:52] all right he's not talking about
[6:56] um having an a new car and that's
[6:59] worldly
[7:00] that's what tickles me you see people
[7:03] they'll preach against uh things and
[7:06] hard and hard and hard but then let them
[7:08] get kind of along you know and things
[7:11] begin to pick up a little bit and you
[7:13] see them pick up a little bit and you
[7:15] know they're driving a new car you know
[7:17] you know but see they forget all of
[7:20] those things that they screamed and
[7:21] hollered about calling the world
[7:24] now if you're head over heels in debt
[7:28] you know and you can't pay the payments
[7:30] and then you go buy a new car
[7:33] that is not only worldly that's stupid
[7:37] I mean that is that okay
[7:40] because you're you're you're going after
[7:43] those things
[7:44] so then it's not the fact of having
[7:46] something
[7:49] it's not the fact of enjoying life
[7:53] seeing people to preach against going to
[7:55] worldly events
[7:57] you know well they'll just hammer it to
[7:59] death about worldly events wrote around
[8:01] them out there in California went to the
[8:05] what was it World fire like Six Flags
[8:07] type of a thing and he said you're
[8:09] taking kids out there while you're out
[8:11] here
[8:13] it is New World yeah yeah
[8:16] and you see he was out constantly
[8:18] hunting and
[8:19] fishing and doing
[8:21] you know it's not that type of thing
[8:25] that you need to be concerned about
[8:30] it's things that will Captivate Us to
[8:33] keep us away from God whether it be
[8:36] hunting fishing new cars uh clothes uh
[8:41] you know new church
[8:44] worldly things that we've got to be you
[8:47] know like the world
[8:49] see it's not just the Natural Things of
[8:52] Life all right now say that because when
[8:55] we get on over into the point in a
[8:56] minute
[8:57] then I won't have to stop and explain
[9:00] when I talk about the world
[9:02] the world is not eating drinking doing
[9:05] and living and making a living and stuff
[9:08] like that that's not worldly
[9:12] events
[9:15] yeah
[9:17] well
[9:19] that's your business go ahead
[9:22] because that way you're condemned for
[9:24] everything
[9:26] even if you ate too much supper tonight
[9:30] see if you're going to take one little
[9:31] thing you got to take it all
[9:33] right right
[9:35] that would be part of the world
[9:37] all right but now we've been talking
[9:39] about trying to get to a place to
[9:41] understand
[9:43] what is brother random talking about
[9:45] when he says that
[9:47] when we come here with a seed in US
[9:51] you know
[9:54] and
[9:55] then it's like this last Sunday we were
[9:58] talking about that
[10:00] he said you always was eternal and we've
[10:02] covered all of those things
[10:05] you know
[10:07] and we're I asked the questions our
[10:10] Sunday
[10:12] where is that seed at
[10:15] if it was put there
[10:17] when was it put there
[10:19] and what kind of a seed is it
[10:24] you know
[10:26] we said well brother then we believe
[10:27] he's in the soul that's a good place to
[10:29] start
[10:31] but when was it put there
[10:34] we'll go back through these things in a
[10:35] minute but it was put down the prophets
[10:37] didn't work before the foundation of the
[10:39] world
[10:40] all right
[10:42] so when he comes along he says I come
[10:43] into the world this seed in me when was
[10:45] it put there
[10:47] when you was in your mom was wound
[10:51] when you dropped out of the womb
[10:54] or was it put there before the
[10:56] foundation of the world all right if
[10:58] we're going to go with him we have to go
[11:00] with what he's saying if not we just
[11:03] take our own thoughts and ideas and not
[11:06] worry about it all right
[11:08] I gave it to you Sunday on the invisible
[11:10] Union
[11:11] paragraph 152.
[11:13] where brother Brown says the seed of God
[11:16] and I'll read it again in a minute can't
[11:18] be in him at the same time
[11:22] the love of the world is there
[11:26] now you see a word that you'd go wrong
[11:28] with what I read
[11:30] if you don't understand what the world
[11:33] is
[11:36] see then you would say anybody went to
[11:37] ball game can't see to God
[11:44] let's go ahead and play your little
[11:46] games because it's going to be over with
[11:48] but now
[11:51] let's think about what John is saying
[11:56] that if we love the world
[11:59] or the things of the world
[12:02] the love of the father is not in US
[12:07] now that's scripture
[12:09] that's scripture I believe it
[12:12] but as I said now is it this or is it
[12:15] that or
[12:16] well it's just being worldly well then I
[12:18] I've come to find out what people call
[12:20] worldly is what
[12:22] I I don't want to do or don't do
[12:27] but you do
[12:30] that's that's worldly
[12:33] so you do
[12:35] yeah
[12:36] people in this message see they oh man
[12:41] give them Christmas trees boy
[12:45] I told some brothers here that was in a
[12:46] church that used to put out tracks about
[12:48] it
[12:49] and the brother got married and I said
[12:51] you wait till the baby comes along
[12:56] no way no way
[12:59] it's okay
[13:00] so Mama comes up expecting you the first
[13:04] year it was kind of announced like this
[13:05] well you can just do what you want to
[13:09] about the Christmas trees ain't gonna
[13:10] say nothing gonna see the next year the
[13:12] baby was there and they put one up you
[13:15] know we'll see we can preach against
[13:17] what is worldly
[13:20] it's worldly to have a new car
[13:23] let somebody offer you one
[13:28] well now that's a different thing
[13:30] it is
[13:34] it's a different thing
[13:36] it's a new car
[13:38] if it's worldly
[13:41] let's see
[13:45] and then I get so tickle that people
[13:48] they'll preach against birth control
[13:49] until they get about seven or eight kids
[13:51] and all at once right in the middle of
[13:53] Life they just stop having any
[14:00] and that don't happen
[14:03] you know
[14:05] so evidently all at once they got the
[14:07] Revelation and
[14:09] so what is worldly
[14:14] now
[14:16] we're going to go through this in a
[14:17] minute
[14:19] the Bible says you can't serve
[14:21] God
[14:24] and Mammon right
[14:31] so I'm asking you a question up front
[14:36] will God dwell in an unclean vessel
[14:46] when you got a lot of scripture about
[14:48] things that are unclean right
[14:51] you got a man named Isaiah that said I'm
[14:54] a man of unclean lips well he wouldn't
[14:56] even go out and speak until God cleaned
[14:59] his lips
[15:05] you see you know you got these unclean
[15:08] unclean unclean throughout the
[15:09] scriptures I said
[15:11] and just think about it
[15:13] would God dwell in an unclean Festival
[15:17] well
[15:21] then what is it
[15:23] what are we doing
[15:26] as I said are we using the scriptures
[15:28] and the things of the message to just
[15:31] justify ourselves
[15:34] I don't do this
[15:36] but you do that you know
[15:40] and that's why you don't see me
[15:41] preaching so much about those type of
[15:43] things
[15:46] because everybody has their own
[15:48] definition of what worldliness is
[15:51] and I could preach 49 sermons on
[15:56] what it is and it wouldn't change one
[15:58] thought of anybody
[16:00] I know that
[16:03] it takes God to
[16:06] to do it
[16:07] you ever heard brother Branham scream
[16:09] out against Ricky's and ricketters
[16:13] right
[16:15] but all at once one day he said
[16:19] God said don't call him Rick he's a
[16:21] ricketta that's my children
[16:24] you remember that
[16:27] right see it took God to straighten the
[16:28] prophet out you understand
[16:31] so let's don't worry about ourselves
[16:32] let's just try to be what we are
[16:36] all right
[16:38] so we went through
[16:40] trying to cover and this is the point I
[16:42] want you to look at
[16:46] that I believe truly
[16:50] and I've read over and over to you
[16:53] well the prophet's message the Bible we
[16:55] read in predestination
[16:58] that a seed was in US
[17:00] when we come into the world
[17:05] but not a literal half of a seed
[17:14] but God's foreknowledge
[17:18] and in his mind
[17:23] you know that in God's mind Jesus Christ
[17:26] died before the foundation of the world
[17:29] right but when did he literally die
[17:32] 2 000 years ago
[17:34] is that the quotes we were given Sunday
[17:36] like from
[17:39] um God keeps his word
[17:43] but it was in his mind
[17:50] and remember now
[17:52] as we've covered before lengthy Services
[17:55] out of it in this series
[17:58] that Judas was in his mind
[18:01] and Judas had his name written in the
[18:04] Book of Life
[18:05] now not in the lounge book of life
[18:07] section of the Eternal but he had his
[18:10] name written in the Book of Life
[18:13] and it was taken out
[18:18] see God then doesn't predestinate by his
[18:21] desires
[18:22] he predestinates by his foreknowledge
[18:27] all right
[18:28] that way we can keep everything together
[18:36] see then as far as God is concerned
[18:39] when Jesus Christ
[18:42] was slain in his mind
[18:46] our names were written in the last book
[18:48] of life before the foundation of the
[18:50] world
[18:51] in his mind
[18:53] you remember them
[18:55] do we need to go back over them
[18:59] like he said on God keeping his word
[19:02] that God spoke and said Christ was the
[19:05] lamb slain from the foundation world
[19:08] when God drew his program in his mind
[19:10] and spoke it Christ was slain there
[19:13] though he actually wasn't slain for four
[19:16] thousand years later
[19:18] and got in there through foreknowledge
[19:20] seen who would be saved and who would
[19:22] not
[19:24] and their names were written in the
[19:26] Lamb's Book of Life at the foundation of
[19:27] the world and associated with the slain
[19:30] lamb
[19:34] you see that's what I've tried my best
[19:35] to get you to see
[19:37] laughs
[19:39] that you send me any quote
[19:42] that the prophet has said
[19:47] in
[19:49] I'm not a bragger or nothing but I
[19:52] believe the Holy Spirit
[19:54] will put that together in the message
[19:57] in the right order
[19:58] now I may have to tell you I don't
[20:00] understand that right now but I'll get
[20:02] back to him to you when he speaks to me
[20:05] no problem
[20:09] but see if our names were written to our
[20:13] then he goes on like in Hebrews chapter
[20:16] 7 we were talking about
[20:18] he said where was Jesus slain at Calvary
[20:22] no sir
[20:24] Jesus was slain before the foundation
[20:26] world Amen
[20:29] amen before the Lamb of God
[20:31] that was slain before the foundation
[20:33] World God in the beginning when he saw
[20:35] the sin he saw what would happen he
[20:39] spoke the word and Jesus was slain
[20:41] before the foundation of the world and
[20:43] every person was saved
[20:46] was saved according to the Bible
[20:49] when the lamb was slain in the mind of
[20:51] God before the foundation of the world
[20:56] see it's in his mind right
[21:03] but now my point was to try to get you
[21:05] to see Sunday
[21:07] if what he sees in his mind doesn't
[21:10] happen on Earth
[21:12] you know or whatever it is about that's
[21:14] in his mind
[21:16] he might see the white Throne he might
[21:17] see something you know but you you know
[21:19] what I'm talking about
[21:22] if God sees something and speaks it
[21:25] it will come to pass right
[21:29] all right
[21:31] see because it's a spoken word right
[21:34] right all right see then it was
[21:35] necessary that he come and die
[21:39] because if he hadn't come and die that
[21:41] would make that false prophecy right you
[21:43] remember we went through all of that
[21:50] but he goes on like like a serpent seed
[21:52] to say the Bible said that we were
[21:53] predestinated to the sons and the sons
[21:56] and Adoption of the sons of God before
[21:58] the foundation world
[22:00] and when God slayed the lamb in his own
[22:03] thinking before the foundation of the
[22:05] world to prove out his attributes what
[22:07] he was when the lamb was slain we were
[22:10] slain with him
[22:12] when the blood of the Lamb was caught in
[22:14] his own mind back there before the
[22:17] foundation of the world mining your
[22:19] names were written on the book then
[22:22] all his great thinking he's infinite
[22:28] now what is it then
[22:32] who is this Melchizedek
[22:35] 65.
[22:37] paragraphs 53.
[22:40] think of it
[22:42] before Jesus was even born
[22:44] 4 000 years before he came on Earth
[22:47] and several thousand years before you
[22:50] came on Earth Jesus in God's mind died
[22:53] for the sins of the world and the Book
[22:55] of Life was made and your name was put
[22:58] on that book of life before the
[23:00] foundation of the world that's the Bible
[23:02] truth see and your name was ordained of
[23:06] God and placed on the book of life
[23:07] before the foundation of the world
[23:08] either in his attributes
[23:12] you don't remember it no
[23:14] because you're just a part of his life
[23:17] he said you're part of God when you
[23:19] become a son and daughter of God
[23:21] right
[23:25] then we read from Christ The Mystery of
[23:27] God revealed
[23:32] paragraph 467.
[23:35] the seed was there the seed was already
[23:38] when was it put there
[23:41] before the foundation of the world
[23:43] has predestinated us unto eternal life
[23:46] and as soon as the life-given flow that
[23:49] seed laying there other seeds that would
[23:52] come in
[23:54] wouldn't take hold just couldn't do it
[23:56] but when that seed come in it quickly
[23:58] stopped up the wound all the rest of the
[24:01] seed was drove out
[24:02] the
[24:04] when was it put dark before the
[24:06] foundation of the world
[24:09] now what was before the foundation of
[24:11] the world
[24:18] were we people back there
[24:21] we gave it from questions and answers
[24:23] when we read Around said no
[24:25] we wouldn't ask him was we Spirits he
[24:27] said no he said we went nothing it was
[24:29] just in the mind of God
[24:33] well then in the mind of God
[24:37] what was his mind seeing
[24:40] what would take place here
[24:43] that should be simple to us
[24:47] then we ought to be totally away from
[24:49] the thoughts of some kind of a seed put
[24:52] in there
[24:54] a spot
[24:57] now remember
[24:59] any spot of God
[25:03] is just as much God
[25:05] as all of God is God
[25:08] right
[25:11] so then I would consider what's
[25:13] you know people say well brother Dale
[25:16] when you say it it just sounds flat
[25:20] but when these others say it is so
[25:21] wonderful and they could just lead me
[25:23] through and I could just look I could
[25:24] see myself there
[25:27] what was you doing
[25:31] we've been through it right we've been
[25:34] through the morning star sign together
[25:35] sons of God shouted for joy
[25:38] was we look back to our shouting
[25:40] or was it were we in God's mind shouting
[25:43] or when we would come down here and
[25:45] receive it
[25:52] brother devil always was eternal
[25:56] if you have eternal life
[25:59] the eternal life we have
[26:01] all right always was eternal
[26:04] just the same as his seeds remind us
[26:06] then this is John said and we cannot sin
[26:11] see when God sees something and I tried
[26:14] to get you to look at it when he sees
[26:16] something
[26:17] he sees it totally finished
[26:20] he doesn't see it as we look at it
[26:25] yeah
[26:28] he sees it totally finished
[26:34] but yet we want to lay on this the the
[26:36] quotes of
[26:38] and I keep bringing that one out just
[26:40] what I brought out others and I'm
[26:42] bringing out you know I will later again
[26:45] we say that little woman at the whale
[26:46] the prophet said that seed was laying
[26:49] there he said it immediately come to
[26:51] life
[26:52] well amen
[26:55] but that didn't give her the new birth
[26:59] see there you say I don't need the new
[27:01] barrels all I need is a knowledge
[27:06] of who I was before the world
[27:10] brother Dale that is my new birth I told
[27:12] you 30 years ago they'd be saying that
[27:14] now they are
[27:16] yeah all right because why people are
[27:18] going to fall after the real truth and
[27:21] and preach on it
[27:23] but how could that little woman at the
[27:25] well be
[27:26] born again when Jesus Christ hadn't died
[27:28] according to the scripture
[27:31] the disciples couldn't be born again
[27:34] until after Jesus's death
[27:38] well what's running around talking about
[27:39] just what I'll give to you and preach to
[27:41] you many many times right around them on
[27:43] perfect faith
[27:45] 1963.
[27:47] he's talking about the little woman at
[27:48] the well he said she had perfect faith
[27:51] for that time
[27:55] right
[27:59] you know that in Acts 14 and 9
[28:03] Paul says perceiving
[28:07] that he had faith
[28:10] to be healed
[28:14] see where to get into scripture
[28:17] Paul looking down or Peter was looking
[28:19] down see him receive it
[28:22] that he had faith
[28:24] what for healing so then right over here
[28:26] tonight God can drop down in this church
[28:28] right over here heal the people
[28:31] he can save people if the atmosphere is
[28:34] correct right
[28:39] you see we want to make it some kind of
[28:40] a mysterious story
[28:44] that makes us feel oh brother when
[28:47] brother so and so preached like this I
[28:49] just get so excited I I just see me
[28:52] jumping around and running around up in
[28:54] heaven
[28:57] we'll run around and said
[29:00] what
[29:04] page 153 Samaritan Church age in your
[29:07] church age book
[29:10] I want to make it known
[29:15] to you I want you you will want to know
[29:18] if I believe in the doctrine of
[29:20] pre-existence
[29:21] I don't believe in that that Mormon
[29:24] Doctrine a pre-existence of Souls
[29:27] because they believe we're literal
[29:29] people back there
[29:31] right
[29:33] yeah
[29:34] my brother told me he said well he
[29:35] didn't say he didn't believe in some
[29:37] form of pre-existence well I believe in
[29:39] pre-existence
[29:41] I believe in pre-existence of eternal
[29:44] life
[29:48] don't you
[29:50] that's why when I receive eternal life
[29:52] I'm just as Eternal I said yes
[29:55] but he said I don't believe in that
[29:57] Mormon doctrine of pre-existence
[29:59] of souls because see they believe we're
[30:01] literal people literally people
[30:05] he said I don't believe in reincarnation
[30:10] he's talking about our souls
[30:12] are the transmigration of Souls
[30:18] now according to Webster transmigration
[30:20] is going from one form to another one so
[30:22] he didn't believe in doing that
[30:24] in reincarnation is
[30:26] you know you hear and you come back in
[30:28] another form
[30:30] he said I didn't believe don't believe
[30:32] that
[30:35] but he believed in pre-existence of
[30:38] eternal life
[30:39] sir
[30:42] and if you have eternal life tonight
[30:44] that eternal life always was eternal
[30:47] all right
[30:50] we see people are saying but brother
[30:52] Dale I've always been taught that I come
[30:54] into the world with eternal life
[30:58] already in me
[31:01] well I'm asking a simple question
[31:03] that's what I asked the two Soul people
[31:06] back in the
[31:08] first part of 70.
[31:13] I said
[31:14] God won't dwell in an unclean vessel
[31:19] they gave you a soul from God and a soul
[31:21] from the Devil
[31:24] and I said first off devil can't create
[31:26] so that leaves it out and the Bible said
[31:28] All Souls are mine
[31:31] so if the devil had some to give out he
[31:33] had to get them from God to get them out
[31:35] and we know he didn't do that
[31:43] but they said well what he was doing
[31:44] said it was that seed laying in our
[31:46] dormant
[31:50] adornment means lifeless
[31:55] that's what it means
[31:56] well was it some form of a seed or Speck
[31:59] a spot a word
[32:03] or was it his foreknowledge
[32:08] now which one is it
[32:11] but I'm just asking a simple question
[32:17] can the seed of God
[32:21] be in US
[32:25] as a seed like we think
[32:28] not thinking of predestinations and
[32:30] foreknowledge
[32:32] is we'll get to it about the little
[32:33] woman he said she had predestination she
[32:36] had uh from foreknowledge
[32:43] but my point is is it's some kind of a
[32:45] spot see a lot of you never knew the two
[32:48] Soul Doctrine you went back there but
[32:51] they'd draw out a heart and they put
[32:54] spots in it and they said that's what's
[32:56] in you that spot's within you
[33:01] well I believe when brother random
[33:03] preached a future home did he drawn out
[33:06] a heart
[33:07] and then he drawed another heart
[33:09] and in one of them he put a dove
[33:12] and the other one he put the devil and I
[33:15] believe he was talking about the same
[33:17] Soul heart whatever
[33:20] because he was explaining regeneration
[33:25] is he taking the devil out
[33:28] and God coming in which is really God
[33:30] coming in is what drives the devil out
[33:32] amen just put it that way all right
[33:36] see then what was God living in there
[33:42] if he was my question there was the same
[33:44] as our now
[33:46] do you mean to tell me
[33:49] that in any form whatsoever
[33:53] any form whatsoever
[33:56] now you see where I'm putting it
[33:58] that the devil is greater than God
[34:07] yeah
[34:09] you don't be little God way down when
[34:11] you say the devil is greater
[34:14] and he's only permitted
[34:18] I see they said God give you so devil
[34:21] give you soul
[34:23] Holy Ghost come down kill the soul of
[34:25] the devil
[34:27] the other soul never needed nothing
[34:28] because it always was eternal
[34:30] now that was their Doctrine now is that
[34:32] what you believe
[34:36] that's not what I believe is what I
[34:37] believed in it ain't what I believe now
[34:39] amen
[34:41] because I'm still of a firm believer and
[34:43] you must be warned again
[34:46] I'm a firm believer in justification
[34:49] sanctification and the baptism of the
[34:52] Holy Ghost
[34:54] and I'm a firm believer in
[34:57] that if God comes and lives in you and I
[35:01] we're not going to live like the world
[35:05] we're going to live in the world and the
[35:07] things of the world that are not sinful
[35:10] outlandishly wrong
[35:14] I explained while ago about world
[35:23] see don't tell me that you can go out
[35:25] and commit adultery and say you're born
[35:27] again
[35:29] don't tell me you can lie cheat and
[35:31] steal drink smoke
[35:34] and say you're born again
[35:38] at least out there on the internet you
[35:40] hear it from me tonight nothing else
[35:42] I've never taught anything like that and
[35:44] I don't believe it I believe you're born
[35:46] again
[35:48] those things are supposed to die
[35:51] he said but brother Dale I still got
[35:52] problems all right I do too
[35:56] brother Branham did too
[36:00] why did he keep a
[36:02] cross hanging on his mirror
[36:06] he said he had it
[36:13] why because you don't go after the world
[36:18] you see if somebody's living in sin
[36:20] they're not born again
[36:27] I said that one time the brother left
[36:29] here on account of that because
[36:31] I told him I said
[36:34] I'm just telling you want to believe
[36:35] brother
[36:37] if you live in like that you're not born
[36:38] again you're telling me I ain't born
[36:40] again yeah
[36:44] go ahead yeah that's what I'm telling
[36:46] you if you live like that you ain't born
[36:48] again
[36:51] because that's the things of the world
[36:54] well you don't think we can make
[36:56] mistakes you don't make them ever other
[36:58] day
[36:59] you know I mean let's don't get into the
[37:01] garbage cans that you know we can run a
[37:04] few days and get out here and commit
[37:06] adultery for three or four days been
[37:07] quit for a month then go back and I just
[37:10] can't stand it now you need to be born
[37:12] again
[37:13] lying cheating stealing drinking
[37:17] all right
[37:18] why because God won't dwell in an
[37:22] unclean vessel
[37:24] now my here's my whole point for the
[37:26] night
[37:27] he won't dwell in an unclean vessel
[37:29] after you're born again
[37:32] and he will not live in an unclean
[37:34] vessel before you get born again because
[37:36] why would he want to make you clean
[37:42] see now you're putting eternal life
[37:45] and that's what people are saying it
[37:47] always was eternal
[37:49] you're putting eternal life into the
[37:52] soul if you want to put it or whatever
[37:53] you want to put in position whatever
[37:58] and then saying you was living like the
[38:00] devil
[38:05] but but brother Dale that wasn't me
[38:06] living that way I was that other well
[38:09] why didn't that other control
[38:12] I mean it looked like God would win the
[38:14] battle sometime
[38:17] right
[38:18] see a lot of you don't know the two Soul
[38:20] Doctrine you never heard it you know
[38:22] what they said when a baby's coming into
[38:23] the world this is what the man said
[38:25] I talked with him I knew him he said
[38:27] when the baby's coming into the world
[38:30] they did so that babies dropped out of
[38:31] that mother said the Devil beats God to
[38:34] her and puts his soul
[38:39] just want to talk
[38:40] so then God comes along behind you know
[38:44] I'm having trouble and he puts his soul
[38:47] that's
[38:48] you want me to illustrate it that's what
[38:50] I'm talking about you mean to tell me
[38:51] and that's what I told him I said look
[38:53] like sometime God would have got there
[38:56] first
[38:58] right of course we got there first
[39:02] there wouldn't have been no sin in the
[39:04] garden
[39:05] right
[39:08] but you see that's where people don't
[39:10] realize
[39:13] and they don't realize they've been
[39:14] taught things until somebody says it
[39:17] then the first reaction is
[39:21] you think I don't know how to look at
[39:23] faces
[39:34] but now listen
[39:37] it was a man one time
[39:44] that he was talking to the Lord Jesus
[39:49] Lord Jesus said and we'll read it right
[39:51] here
[39:52] he said Peter
[39:55] he said after you're converted
[40:01] strengthen the brethren
[40:05] yeah but brother they only had yeah they
[40:07] did because Jesus was with them come on
[40:10] I don't think I can't follow a line
[40:13] Jesus when he was here with him he gave
[40:15] them power to do what they were doing
[40:17] which was to cast out devil heal the
[40:19] sick Etc but when he was ready to leave
[40:22] he called him in right
[40:25] why because he was not going to be able
[40:27] to be there right as before
[40:31] he called him in and said Don't You
[40:33] Preach no more
[40:34] until you're endued with power from on
[40:37] high
[40:38] then when they were endued with powerful
[40:40] on high Jesus was not just with him he
[40:42] was in them
[40:44] right
[40:46] that's right he said Peter
[40:48] let's just read it let's start right
[40:50] here now
[40:51] if I go a little empty tonight forgive
[40:53] me if you need to go get up and go
[40:56] now no problem
[40:59] I just want to get this part out and
[41:00] then we can do it go ahead with number
[41:02] one which is questions and answers 1954
[41:05] uh 5 16.
[41:08] E21
[41:10] and he's explaining about Peter
[41:13] and coming down
[41:15] and when he gets down he says
[41:18] after you're converted
[41:21] well I've been baptized by you
[41:24] know who's this Peter right
[41:27] Jesus Christ baptized Peter
[41:29] there's an argument in the message of
[41:31] whether Jesus was baptized or were they
[41:34] baptized each other who baptized what
[41:35] and
[41:38] come on
[41:40] he baptized he is the apostles all right
[41:43] now he said now I've been baptized by
[41:45] I've done all these things
[41:48] and I've walked by you
[41:50] I've been saved and you give me power
[41:56] okay
[41:57] you wouldn't expect God to put that
[41:59] power
[42:01] in an unclean vessel
[42:07] so he had to clean them up and give them
[42:09] a
[42:10] life of of sincerity anyhow
[42:15] before he he let them go out and preach
[42:19] the gospel and he returned back
[42:21] rejoicing said well even the Devils is
[42:24] subject to us that's before Calvary you
[42:27] know your Bible
[42:28] he gave him power but he on he cleaned
[42:31] them up first
[42:33] come on are you reading it
[42:37] they went through justification and
[42:39] sanctification
[42:42] right
[42:44] that was cleaning them up the unclean
[42:46] Spirit went out of a man sanctification
[42:48] all right
[42:51] for he let him preach when he was there
[42:53] with him
[42:54] all right and why then he said now Peter
[42:57] I know all this
[42:59] but you're not converted yet the
[43:02] you're not right yet Peter you're not
[43:05] converted but after Thou Art converted
[43:07] then strengthen your brethren
[43:10] Peter hadn't received the Holy Ghost yet
[43:12] see when the Holy Ghost come then Peter
[43:14] was an inspired teacher amen
[43:17] amen all right
[43:20] move on to the next one
[43:22] hear ye him 19.
[43:25] 58 e29 do you think that God would put
[43:31] new you think God would put his holy oil
[43:35] in an unclean vessel
[43:38] certainly not
[43:39] as I said go into Leviticus and read of
[43:42] the cleansing
[43:44] and you just didn't pick up something
[43:46] and you know you just go get your cup is
[43:48] laying out in the yard that's a good cup
[43:50] make a drinking cup you wouldn't even do
[43:52] it now right
[43:53] what do you do you wash the thing
[43:57] it's unclean
[44:01] now remember what I'm talking about so
[44:03] you won't lose my thought I'm going to
[44:05] repeat it repeat it and repeat it
[44:09] I don't believe you come here with
[44:12] eternal life in you
[44:16] amen and don't need to be born again
[44:19] to receive eternal life I don't believe
[44:21] that he said well I you're off the
[44:23] message I'll leave goodbye
[44:26] I taught this 40 years ago why change
[44:29] now
[44:31] I've always taught it that away it's
[44:33] always believed it that way
[44:34] I don't believe you come in the world
[44:36] with eternal life in you and you lost in
[44:38] a sinner where was it at
[44:41] when your show was lost
[44:44] and needed salvation
[44:49] Jesus had to clean up the disciples
[44:51] before he lived let them preach
[44:55] then he had to burn out all the rest of
[44:58] it
[44:59] before you let them go by himself
[45:02] now do you think that God would put his
[45:04] holy oil in an unclean vessel read the
[45:07] Old Testament rules
[45:08] and see if he put oil over in an unclean
[45:11] vessel
[45:15] now come on
[45:18] all right
[45:21] look at this next one
[45:25] and inside excuse me an uncertain sound
[45:28] paragraph or E39
[45:30] through the church means are called out
[45:32] and separated
[45:33] and two people can't live in you
[45:37] the same time
[45:43] you've got to die out to the things of
[45:45] the world to serve God you can't love
[45:47] God and Mama at the same time and as
[45:50] long as the love of the world is in the
[45:53] the believer's heart he crowds out and
[45:55] deprives himself from the Privileges
[45:58] that God's give him
[46:01] all right
[46:05] what are we doing
[46:08] you can't
[46:09] believe two people can't live in now now
[46:12] brother Dale but remember now about the
[46:14] white dog black dog you need to read
[46:18] the old Indian said after me born again
[46:20] after me get Holy Ghost now Black Dog
[46:24] white dog
[46:26] he didn't say before he's born again
[46:30] right
[46:31] see the two Soul people and all that
[46:32] people now believe there was two Natures
[46:36] there
[46:40] the nature of God and the nature of the
[46:42] world
[46:44] they don't want to call it Souls because
[46:46] they don't want to be related to the old
[46:48] doctrines
[46:50] that went into polygamy
[46:56] we see they don't want to go along with
[46:57] it
[47:00] but two people can't be in you at the
[47:02] same time
[47:06] going to the next
[47:14] this is the one I was quoting while ago
[47:16] and been quoting invisible Union
[47:18] paragraph 157 Jesus said you cannot
[47:21] serve two Gods at the same time
[47:24] you either serve God or Mama
[47:28] is the world
[47:31] he that loves the world are the things
[47:33] of the world the love of God is not even
[47:34] in him the seed of God can't be in him
[47:37] the same time the love of God the love
[47:40] of the world you know what he's he's not
[47:42] talking wrong he's quoted it wrong said
[47:45] the love of the world is in there when
[47:47] the seed of God is operating through you
[47:48] that's the word of God the little over
[47:50] the world can't be in there at the same
[47:52] time now where is the short hire and the
[47:55] shorts and the painted face
[47:57] Now where's it at you can't be there
[48:00] so the seed of God can't be in you at
[48:02] the same time
[48:03] as the seed of Satan or Satan in his
[48:07] ways
[48:09] and we were all born in Satan's domain
[48:13] whether we like it or not
[48:16] and born kin folks to the devil
[48:20] and had to be born again
[48:25] that's what Nicodemus couldn't
[48:26] understand right
[48:28] now what's this next one taken from
[48:30] spoken words reading a seed 1962
[48:32] paragraph 198.
[48:35] excuse me 196.
[48:41] he said if you're not yours no more come
[48:44] on just roll it up because you can read
[48:46] all in between and see it was waiting
[48:48] germs night
[48:49] he can't be a hybrid
[48:52] and a son at the same time
[48:56] he's either a son of death
[48:59] or son of life
[49:01] right so if he's the son of death
[49:05] get it over to the devil and let him
[49:06] give it over to God I meant and let him
[49:10] kill the devil that's in you run him out
[49:12] haulers you out then let God plan his
[49:15] own life in you and it's not you no more
[49:18] it's God's life because it's God's word
[49:20] watered by the Holy Spirit and will
[49:22] produce the same thing yes I just love
[49:24] to preach on that a few minutes
[49:26] but with that 30 40 pages of scripture
[49:29] he'd have to go through
[49:31] all right listen
[49:34] look at the next one Abraham
[49:36] preached 1955.
[49:40] 56 excuse me 55 yeah e61.
[49:45] you say you come around you praise the
[49:47] Lord you do this you know if a seed goes
[49:49] into the ground a grain of wheat it
[49:51] cannot produce anything else but a grain
[49:52] of wheat so if you go around and say
[49:55] well praise the Lord I've been saved I
[49:58] got the Holy Ghost and I live any kind
[50:00] of a life you better get back to the
[50:02] altar of God again because the
[50:04] Incorruptible seed of God
[50:08] come on you just read what your Prophet
[50:10] said cannot be one thing you cannot be a
[50:13] wheat and a kookabur at the same time
[50:17] you've got to be either you've got to
[50:20] either be a wheat or a kookaburra you
[50:24] all got cuckoo birds down here all right
[50:26] Greenbrier then ever what you want to
[50:28] call them thanks from the week you can't
[50:30] be a weed and a wheat at the same time
[50:33] if you've got the spirit in you of the
[50:36] life of the wheat you'll produce wheat
[50:39] if you've got the spirit into you the
[50:41] life of the Kookaburra it'll be a
[50:43] kookaburra and if the Holy Ghost is in
[50:45] you
[50:46] you'll believe God love God and act like
[50:49] a Christian that's right if it isn't
[50:52] you'll know them by the fruits they buy
[50:54] her okay
[50:56] all right
[50:58] what about it
[51:02] what about it
[51:04] how many times
[51:06] I didn't write this down but how many
[51:08] times do you think brother Brown said
[51:10] white bird black bird black bird white
[51:12] bird and said you can't be that
[51:17] you can't be a white bird or a blackbird
[51:20] you're either a white bird or a
[51:22] blackbird
[51:23] now he ain't talking about no speckled
[51:26] up that's hybrids right
[51:29] yes where you won't run your silly mind
[51:32] in the wrong direction
[51:34] what's he talking about so let's go to
[51:36] that
[51:38] this is
[51:39] healing and what sickness is in 1950.
[51:43] e22 and there's only two resources that
[51:47] Spirits can come from
[51:49] that's either from God or the devil
[51:52] there's no halfway between them there's
[51:55] no Highway Christian did you ever see a
[51:57] drunk sober man did you ever see a black
[51:59] white bird you've never seen a center
[52:01] Saint
[52:03] you're either a Christian or you're a
[52:05] sinner
[52:06] that's what I like about you Full Gospel
[52:10] people you put the line down and you're
[52:14] on one side or the other if you're born
[52:16] again if I'm born born to human I'm a
[52:20] human when you're born a Christian
[52:21] you're a Christian
[52:23] all right black white bird
[52:28] go to the next one
[52:30] Israel in the church 1953.
[52:34] paragraph
[52:36] 31.
[52:38] I said I'm a pretty good Christian I
[52:40] said no you're not
[52:45] there is no pretty good Christian
[52:47] how many ever seen a drunk sober man
[52:49] nobody
[52:51] how many ever seen a black white bird
[52:52] nobody
[52:54] it's either you've never seen a sinner
[52:56] signed you're either born again or
[52:59] you're not born again you're either on
[53:01] one side of the fence
[53:03] now if you are born again you have
[53:06] everlasting life and there's nothing
[53:09] within you all the old things that have
[53:12] passed away
[53:13] and there's just the fountain bitter and
[53:16] sweet watch you
[53:18] don't come from the same fountain
[53:21] bitter and sweet don't come from it
[53:23] we're going to read that scripture in
[53:24] just a second
[53:25] the tree is known by the fruit it bears
[53:27] by the fruits you shall know them
[53:31] go into James Street unless you see what
[53:33] he's talking about
[53:35] James 3
[53:37] out of the same mouth precede His
[53:39] blessings and cursings you remember
[53:41] bother what he's explaining the tongue
[53:43] is the member it can't be tamed
[53:46] first time mouth proceedeth blessings
[53:48] and cursing my brethren these things
[53:51] ought not to be so not so to be
[53:55] now watch him
[53:57] if it's if you've seen the fountain do
[54:00] it or if you've seen the brother or
[54:01] sister doing it
[54:04] you don't judge them and condemn them to
[54:06] hell
[54:09] but you know there's something wrong
[54:12] right
[54:13] or they wouldn't be that way
[54:15] right so now what's wrong
[54:21] well I mean come on you tell me the
[54:23] prostitute that Jesus you know there was
[54:25] and told her about her you know the lady
[54:28] with the husbands and the prostitutes
[54:30] told to go and sin no more you know and
[54:32] all the one with the five and all you
[54:34] think they went home and kept up their
[54:35] product their
[54:37] uh job
[54:43] now if you do there's something wrong
[54:44] with you mentally let alone spiritually
[54:50] yeah but that was a white note
[54:53] we're not talking about silliness
[54:56] because what does he say
[54:59] he's telling you that can't be why he
[55:02] says does the fountain send forth at the
[55:04] same time Sweet Water and bitter
[55:08] it cannot be
[55:11] getting the Fig Tree my brethren by
[55:13] Olive berries
[55:15] either of iron figs
[55:19] so can no fountain
[55:22] both yield salt water and fresh
[55:26] saying
[55:28] these things Brethren ought not to be
[55:31] because you're showing you lost
[55:36] right
[55:39] you're showing you lost
[55:43] come on
[55:47] look at this one about the white bird
[55:49] black bird
[55:51] spiritual Amnesia 1964. I'd like to get
[55:54] on over in and come over in Vice to 63s
[55:58] there were people
[56:00] always changed his mind
[56:04] this is taking spiritual Amnesia in
[56:06] 1964.
[56:08] Birmingham Alabama
[56:10] you must be identified some were you
[56:13] must show
[56:14] your life shows tonight and where you
[56:16] are identified
[56:17] you are identified either in Christ
[56:20] are out of Christ
[56:24] you're not the highway there is no such
[56:27] a thing as a drunk sober man there is no
[56:30] black white bird
[56:32] you're either saved or you're not saved
[56:36] you are a saint or a sinner one of the
[56:38] other and your spiritual attitude
[56:41] towards God's word identifies you
[56:43] exactly where you're standing
[56:46] repeat it again
[56:49] I don't believe you come into the world
[56:52] with eternal life in you as a possession
[56:56] as a soul from God and then you had a
[56:59] soul from the devil it came because if
[57:01] you come into it with a soul from God
[57:03] and it was eternal why did you do wrong
[57:07] now come on
[57:12] like I said the other day which side do
[57:14] you want to take because you're going to
[57:15] make it bump your mind
[57:17] you're going to be on the side when I
[57:19] come in the world with eternal life
[57:20] don't need nothing
[57:22] and if you move over on the other side
[57:23] in any way
[57:25] and say but I need to be saved you just
[57:27] annihilated your thought
[57:29] you don't realize that
[57:34] come on this is the biggest bunch of
[57:35] dummies I've ever seen in the message
[57:36] spiritually speaking
[57:38] sorry about that
[57:42] but how can you be on one side defense
[57:44] and on the other side of the fence
[57:47] I mean at least you could try to get
[57:50] them halfway
[57:53] and right
[57:54] he might wouldn't work
[57:56] of course there's no such thing
[57:58] all right
[57:59] look at the next one
[58:07] this is perseverance
[58:09] reaches 62 paragraph 24.
[58:12] 25 excuse me
[58:14] inside of Youth Avenue that's the same
[58:16] place that God set up every man from
[58:17] Adam Eve said will
[58:20] he will to live are you will to die
[58:22] neither one you want to
[58:25] if you're based on free more agency in
[58:27] whatever spirit that you let dominate
[58:28] you will bring forth the fruits your
[58:31] life will be dominated by the inside
[58:34] and
[58:35] faith
[58:36] so many people arrive on these five
[58:38] senses on the outside they're fine
[58:40] nothing against them if they agree with
[58:42] the Sixth Sense the soul the spirit only
[58:46] can be of two kinds and watch it can't
[58:50] be of two kinds
[58:52] gotta remember
[58:54] whatever you call it
[58:57] it's five senses of the body five cents
[59:00] to the second realm one sense or the
[59:03] center Rim which is either Faith or
[59:05] doubt it's not two kinds
[59:09] one of them is the spirit of God the
[59:12] other is the spirit of the devil you
[59:13] can't serve two masters at the same time
[59:17] you can't do it
[59:19] you're only given to one or you're holy
[59:21] given to the other
[59:22] and if you've got the spirit of God in
[59:24] you you've got faith
[59:27] and you'll believe every word that God
[59:29] wrote If you haven't
[59:31] and you might be
[59:34] look at Luke 16 what did Jesus say
[59:39] Luke 16 and 13.
[59:43] no servant can serve to Masters
[59:47] for he will hate the one and love the
[59:50] other or else he will hold to the one
[59:52] and despise the other you cannot serve
[59:55] God and the world right is that that
[59:58] word Mana
[59:59] mailman
[1:00:02] you can't do it
[1:00:05] see then how can you howl the seed of
[1:00:06] God in you
[1:00:09] in any form as a reality
[1:00:15] and how the devil in at the same time
[1:00:20] because see people don't believe that
[1:00:22] the devil is their master
[1:00:25] I don't believe in one Ken folks the
[1:00:27] devil they believe there's one can force
[1:00:29] to God
[1:00:30] well you know according to the Branham
[1:00:32] brother Branham the Bible saying All
[1:00:35] Souls are mine and wrote around and said
[1:00:37] every person is a Son of God by creation
[1:00:42] every person in the world is the Son of
[1:00:44] God by creation because Satan can't
[1:00:45] create
[1:00:46] he can't create a soul
[1:00:50] he perverts the nature of your soul sure
[1:00:53] God brings your soul as perfect as could
[1:00:56] be I didn't say Eternal I said perfect
[1:00:59] when that baby comes
[1:01:02] but this world perverts the nature of
[1:01:04] that child
[1:01:06] now where is the seed put then
[1:01:09] if it's a literal form of a seed
[1:01:16] that's all I'm asking that's all I've
[1:01:18] ever asked
[1:01:21] look at this and about the black white
[1:01:23] bird Fellowship
[1:01:24] through the reconciliation of the blood
[1:01:26] preached in 19. 55.
[1:01:30] what a marvelous Victorious Life halfway
[1:01:32] life is the most miserable thing there
[1:01:34] is
[1:01:35] and by the way there's no such thing as
[1:01:38] a highly Christian you never seen one
[1:01:41] you never will
[1:01:43] did you ever see a black white bird
[1:01:46] at the same time
[1:01:49] did you ever see a drunk sober man no
[1:01:51] you never did see a sinner sign you're
[1:01:54] either a sinner or a saint
[1:01:56] you're on one side of the fence
[1:02:00] if you're born again you're saved if
[1:02:02] you're not born again you're outside of
[1:02:04] Christ without hope without God
[1:02:07] in the world God's made preparation for
[1:02:10] you to be saved
[1:02:12] okay
[1:02:14] look at this one
[1:02:17] message called Faith preached in
[1:02:22] 56.
[1:02:25] Jesus never preached a funeral
[1:02:31] right
[1:02:34] death and life can't stay together at
[1:02:37] the same time
[1:02:39] one more time
[1:02:41] I don't believe
[1:02:42] you come into the world with eternal
[1:02:45] life already in you
[1:02:48] I believe you must be born again to
[1:02:50] receive that eternal life
[1:02:54] and I don't believe there was some kind
[1:02:56] of a word or a seed put down in you
[1:03:01] I believe it was God's foreknowledge
[1:03:06] that he would predestinate
[1:03:11] you and I
[1:03:13] to be because of what he foreknew
[1:03:16] foresaw what you would want
[1:03:22] and what do you need a seed for
[1:03:27] I mean you don't never hear these
[1:03:29] priests with it why don't if people are
[1:03:31] going to preach all this about seeds and
[1:03:32] everything
[1:03:33] you never hear them preached like the
[1:03:35] prophet said
[1:03:36] like the Bible says the Bible says the
[1:03:39] angels are ministering Spirits what
[1:03:42] that's right to minister to who
[1:03:46] The Heirs of salvation
[1:03:53] you know Brother Dean when you was down
[1:03:54] there
[1:03:55] your sister or somebody or let's go to
[1:03:59] church
[1:04:01] going to church
[1:04:06] right
[1:04:10] it's kind of went to church
[1:04:17] how many angles does it take to get you
[1:04:19] there
[1:04:22] now if there are ministering Spirits or
[1:04:25] they just give to you right today you're
[1:04:26] born again
[1:04:27] or they would be following you all your
[1:04:30] life
[1:04:32] make up your mind which way it is
[1:04:36] if I was going to preach eternal life
[1:04:38] I'd really try to get into it great
[1:04:41] but you don't even hear him preaching
[1:04:42] that because they don't even know how to
[1:04:43] preach it that way
[1:04:46] but you see that angel could not save
[1:04:47] you
[1:04:49] remember we just put a sermon on that
[1:04:52] that brother Branham said the angel
[1:04:56] brought the message to Paul
[1:04:59] and to to uh ananias
[1:05:03] and to Peter
[1:05:07] Peter said that the Visions I didn't
[1:05:11] save nobody
[1:05:13] the seed comes through the body amen
[1:05:16] Angel come to Mary
[1:05:19] she said be it unto me according to Thy
[1:05:20] Word
[1:05:21] but the Bible says a holy ghost
[1:05:23] overshadowed her
[1:05:25] it was not an angel
[1:05:27] delivering the seed
[1:05:31] what's wrong with us folks
[1:05:35] you know but you're just too hard
[1:05:37] and Iran said I'll be glad to see a day
[1:05:39] when they come look people in the eyes
[1:05:41] say you're not preaching what Paul did
[1:05:44] I'll be glad to see a Time come in this
[1:05:46] message when some people stand up and
[1:05:48] looks the preachers in the eye and said
[1:05:50] that ain't right
[1:05:58] I know I'm a hateful old dude
[1:06:01] but you stand up in somebody's face and
[1:06:03] tell them it ain't right
[1:06:06] if I'm anywhere around there and I know
[1:06:08] you're right about what you're saying
[1:06:10] I'll be standing side of you
[1:06:14] so you just go ahead and tell him it
[1:06:15] ain't right
[1:06:17] and then just turn around step back and
[1:06:19] I'll just step up and we'll start
[1:06:21] talking
[1:06:23] would you do that brother Dale
[1:06:26] better believe I would
[1:06:29] you ought to yourself
[1:06:36] sure I was in a church
[1:06:39] and sit and listened to people crying
[1:06:41] crying
[1:06:42] and telling the brother that they knew
[1:06:44] when they got born again he said but you
[1:06:46] didn't get it
[1:06:47] that was his church and I walked out
[1:06:52] I had to leave because I told him
[1:06:55] when I left why I left
[1:06:58] and I said them people crying
[1:07:01] and talking to you about the
[1:07:03] the things the prophet said that he
[1:07:06] meant people with a holy ghost 50 years
[1:07:07] before him just like the day of
[1:07:09] Pentecost
[1:07:14] what is it
[1:07:16] how about this one as I thought on my
[1:07:19] way
[1:07:20] 1959
[1:07:22] e79
[1:07:28] number 14 brother
[1:07:35] I know let's go ahead and pick it up
[1:07:37] even what division was I know it was
[1:07:40] some kind of a power he's talking like
[1:07:41] that
[1:07:42] and you're looking at my hand
[1:07:45] and how it swales
[1:07:47] he saw these little white things run
[1:07:49] over my hand
[1:07:51] that's just like a vibration
[1:07:53] like a bird because the holy spirit's in
[1:07:57] you
[1:07:58] and death is on you
[1:08:00] listen
[1:08:01] and death and life excuse me and life
[1:08:05] and death cannot associate together
[1:08:13] now you go ahead and put them inside of
[1:08:15] you
[1:08:15] because if you're saying you come here
[1:08:17] with this spot already something
[1:08:19] physical something literal then you got
[1:08:24] God's word with the devil there
[1:08:28] go ahead
[1:08:30] questions and answers 1961.
[1:08:33] or 15.
[1:08:36] they must have blown out in there
[1:08:37] somewhere
[1:08:38] and thinking on that I was thinking of
[1:08:41] this
[1:08:42] that death is associated not with life
[1:08:45] life and death cannot exist at the same
[1:08:48] time
[1:08:49] and the trees have to how the South go
[1:08:51] out of them before that leaf can die on
[1:08:54] a tree so therefore death is associated
[1:08:58] you know what he's talking about
[1:09:00] I would think in the Realms of a human
[1:09:02] being
[1:09:04] death is associated with sin
[1:09:07] because before we had any sin we had no
[1:09:10] death at all
[1:09:12] but word there is death then there is
[1:09:15] sin and where there is sin there is
[1:09:17] death because death is results of sin
[1:09:21] and and then he that the soul that
[1:09:24] sinneth it shall die
[1:09:26] but when you're born again of the spirit
[1:09:28] of God we have eternal life
[1:09:30] and not associated anyway with death see
[1:09:33] death cannot associate with life life
[1:09:36] cannot associate with death
[1:09:39] uncertain sound 1961 eat 39.
[1:09:44] to the church the means are called out
[1:09:46] excuse me I was supposed to quote him
[1:09:51] the same ones I gave you want to go
[1:09:53] that two persons can't live in you at
[1:09:55] the same time
[1:09:57] you got to die out to the things of the
[1:09:58] world
[1:10:00] you can't serve
[1:10:03] God in Mammon
[1:10:05] it's as simple as I can be I've made
[1:10:07] myself blunt over 40 years
[1:10:10] than what I stick with and I believe it
[1:10:13] I believe you must be born again
[1:10:17] I believe you come into the world lost
[1:10:20] doomed and I mean you and brother random
[1:10:24] he said he was a hybrid you go check it
[1:10:27] out
[1:10:28] he told about him getting born again go
[1:10:30] check it out
[1:10:33] but yet we come up with a quote or
[1:10:35] something like I said about the little
[1:10:37] woman at the well
[1:10:40] you see that seed was laying there
[1:10:42] and brother Ryan says
[1:10:44] did as quick as it crossed and he come
[1:10:46] across and said he said it was quick in
[1:10:47] the Life what was Quicken that he was
[1:10:49] the Messiah
[1:10:54] what was quicker to the little lady back
[1:10:56] there when it was it Elijah
[1:11:01] it was quicker to her that her child
[1:11:03] would live after Elijah went you
[1:11:06] remember I'm not leaving you
[1:11:09] you going with me
[1:11:12] her confidence was in him being there
[1:11:15] when it was faith for the time
[1:11:20] a sinner
[1:11:23] can receive faith and be born again
[1:11:24] don't you believe that
[1:11:27] dinner can be healed how many do you
[1:11:29] want of this run around and said
[1:11:31] a sin across the platform
[1:11:33] and be healed he said in true Christian
[1:11:36] I was looking at him yesterday
[1:11:38] true Christians
[1:11:40] come across the platform
[1:11:43] maybe be delivered time they leave the
[1:11:45] platform it's done come back
[1:11:51] but to be healed is not a holy ghost
[1:11:53] revelation of a new birth
[1:11:58] you said well brother Dale what do you
[1:12:00] believe I'll get to it Sunday I believe
[1:12:02] that God by his own foreknowledge
[1:12:06] look down and seen who would be saved
[1:12:10] and who wouldn't
[1:12:12] and that he would assign an angel
[1:12:15] to go with you
[1:12:18] but the angel couldn't convert you
[1:12:23] the one brought around and talked to
[1:12:25] couldn't convert him
[1:12:28] and when you get around to saying it was
[1:12:30] Christ now you get in a different
[1:12:31] situation but remember he's a prophet
[1:12:34] ain't talking about me and you
[1:12:36] what I saw when I was 11 were 12 years
[1:12:38] old never converted me
[1:12:41] but I saw it
[1:12:42] you can take a lie detector's test I'll
[1:12:44] be glad to do it
[1:12:46] to see if one I saw was real to me
[1:12:52] but you see people believe that let's
[1:12:53] take a quote let us take thoughts
[1:12:55] they say well brother down I've always
[1:12:58] been talked to you as well it's about
[1:12:59] time to quit thinking like everybody
[1:13:02] and get down to thinking wait wait just
[1:13:04] a minute I could be wrong
[1:13:07] but no
[1:13:08] you ain't been in a good Baptist have
[1:13:10] you if I deny the father
[1:13:13] I'll be denying the son and if I deny
[1:13:17] the Holy Ghost I'll be denying God so I
[1:13:20] got to believe there's three gods
[1:13:22] I can't explain it so I'll say it three
[1:13:25] not in three persons Blessed Trinity
[1:13:30] if I say I ain't saved then I ain't
[1:13:33] saved let's grow some bread around him
[1:13:35] that says yeah
[1:13:37] right
[1:13:39] but you go back and check where he's
[1:13:41] putting it at
[1:13:42] you can be a justification
[1:13:45] and you can lose that part of your
[1:13:47] salvation that has started working
[1:13:49] and it can be taken away it was with
[1:13:52] Judas
[1:13:55] you can be at sanctification
[1:13:58] and lose that
[1:14:03] which you can't have the new birth and
[1:14:06] lose
[1:14:06] the new birth
[1:14:08] eternal life
[1:14:12] he said well why are you so hard these
[1:14:15] kids are sitting here
[1:14:18] you think they're not listening you
[1:14:20] think the kids out on the internet and
[1:14:21] things are not listening
[1:14:23] they've been taught
[1:14:26] that all they got to do
[1:14:28] is go to church and be good and believe
[1:14:30] the prophet brother Raymond was a
[1:14:31] prophet and they're automatically on
[1:14:33] their way to heaven
[1:14:35] because it always was eternal
[1:14:39] they ain't no denomination ever taught
[1:14:41] that bad
[1:14:44] that's a slang I know it I'm glad to say
[1:14:47] it they ain't a denomination in the
[1:14:49] world and I know of ever taught it that
[1:14:51] way even the Catholics going to put you
[1:14:53] through a ritual
[1:14:55] the bad news are going to get you
[1:14:56] baptized the message is going to
[1:14:58] sprinkle you
[1:15:00] a presbyterian is going to do their way
[1:15:05] right
[1:15:06] you gonna do something
[1:15:11] well we do oh we're not coming to work
[1:15:13] with eternal life so I don't have to
[1:15:14] worry about it I know I know I know that
[1:15:17] I'm not living too good I'm living like
[1:15:19] but one of these days one of these days
[1:15:21] I've changed
[1:15:23] you poor deceived hypocrite
[1:15:26] and them Hypocrites had taught you that
[1:15:28] way
[1:15:31] I'm not trying to build a kingdom
[1:15:37] I'm trying my best to say Souls
[1:15:40] to tell you the truth
[1:15:42] but if I become your enemy because I
[1:15:44] tell you the truth I'm sorry
[1:15:48] I told you there Sunday I dug a church
[1:15:50] out of going into adultery that they
[1:15:54] were already deciding who was going home
[1:15:57] with who to live with who and how
[1:15:59] polygamy
[1:16:03] and I told him it's wrong
[1:16:06] told him in a harsh way that's wrong
[1:16:11] but I become their enemy
[1:16:23] I won't apologize for for the truth
[1:16:27] I'll apologize to anybody for hurting
[1:16:28] her feelings
[1:16:30] or for saying something they didn't
[1:16:31] agree with
[1:16:33] I'm not going to apologize for the truth
[1:16:35] that's right
[1:16:37] I'm not going to do it
[1:16:39] I'm going to stand with it because I'll
[1:16:41] face it at judgment right but you know
[1:16:43] what you will face it too
[1:16:49] I believe what the prophet said
[1:16:54] I believe when he said
[1:16:56] eternal life begins right here at the
[1:16:58] altar
[1:17:03] and you show me that he wasn't right on
[1:17:05] up to the day that he died
[1:17:07] even up in the the communion which was
[1:17:10] the last message where he lays down our
[1:17:13] points you know that I'm not I find out
[1:17:15] I wasn't as soon as Charles and Ella
[1:17:16] Brown
[1:17:18] well I found out I wasn't a child a
[1:17:21] child of
[1:17:22] my mama and daddy sister Gail you find
[1:17:24] out by the new birth that you wasn't a
[1:17:25] child of them that ain't taken away from
[1:17:27] your mom and daddy bringing you here
[1:17:29] that's saying you wasn't of that that's
[1:17:32] the natural seed
[1:17:34] Abraham had a natural seed I'd read them
[1:17:37] today
[1:17:40] he said it was a natural Seed of Abraham
[1:17:43] named Isaac
[1:17:44] but he said there was a spiritual Seed
[1:17:47] of Abraham he said that's Christ
[1:17:56] is the Seed of Abraham that I'm
[1:17:58] concerned with
[1:17:59] right I love my Mom and Daddy and you
[1:18:01] know that
[1:18:02] do you know I'm not throwing off on
[1:18:04] nobody I'm just telling it like it is
[1:18:08] by being what we are we can
[1:18:14] claim our families
[1:18:17] right
[1:18:20] right now we don't believe in garbage
[1:18:21] cans
[1:18:23] We Believe In following the truth don't
[1:18:25] we
[1:18:27] but take on these things
[1:18:30] we'll take it up Sunday now let's run
[1:18:31] through a message
[1:18:32] we wrote around him on that message I've
[1:18:34] given you there at 154 the church age
[1:18:36] book where he said he didn't believe in
[1:18:37] that Mormon Doctrine he said it's not
[1:18:39] the person it comes predestinated
[1:18:42] eternally from God
[1:18:44] he said it's the cedar word
[1:18:47] so forget what you're looking at
[1:18:50] you can't have no predestination in what
[1:18:53] you're looking at all of it is going to
[1:18:55] have to be covered by foreknowledge even
[1:18:56] if he got any even if you're believing
[1:18:58] you come with eternal life you're still
[1:19:00] going to have to believe the body and
[1:19:02] things come by foreknowledge
[1:19:06] even if you think you always was eternal
[1:19:08] that need to be saved you still know you
[1:19:10] got to deal with this thing
[1:19:17] you take the doctrines
[1:19:19] that went that away
[1:19:21] and they've all went into adultery
[1:19:24] polygamies and times
[1:19:28] as I said a good denomination don't even
[1:19:30] do that
[1:19:40] Church we've heard the truth what are we
[1:19:41] going to do about it
[1:19:45] what are we going to do about it
[1:19:47] it ain't what everybody else is because
[1:19:49] I ain't concerned about everybody else
[1:19:52] I'm preaching to you
[1:19:53] if anybody else wants to listen that's
[1:19:55] up to them when I'm not their pastor
[1:19:59] huh
[1:20:01] I'm the pastor to those who call this
[1:20:03] their Church
[1:20:11] think on these things come on brother
[1:20:15] see we just play with words and quotes
[1:20:17] and ideas and thoughts
[1:20:21] you know just play with it
[1:20:26] I've been through all of it in this
[1:20:28] series
[1:20:29] over and over brother Ryan said if you
[1:20:32] have eternal life
[1:20:33] you always was eternal
[1:20:37] he said you were only in his thinking he
[1:20:41] said not your being here
[1:20:45] you were only in his thinking
[1:20:49] as far as God is concerned his thinking
[1:20:51] his reality but as far as we're
[1:20:54] concerned we've got to deal with this
[1:20:57] right Amen in Salvation and deliverance
[1:21:01] right
[1:21:03] as far as he's concerned it was over
[1:21:06] before the world
[1:21:08] right
[1:21:11] but now let me ask you a question
[1:21:14] I know I'm funny and I know I'm sorry
[1:21:17] but this is the way I think
[1:21:22] I ask you a question
[1:21:24] if there is a God
[1:21:28] that's not to me that's to you
[1:21:34] do you mean that he would allow 68
[1:21:37] million people
[1:21:39] let me take Joe Lewis aside for a moment
[1:21:42] you remember that not the boxer Joe
[1:21:43] Lewis was another guy
[1:21:45] yeah
[1:21:46] he said how would he fold his arms
[1:21:51] and let them die by the Millions
[1:21:54] if he was God
[1:21:57] you remember that
[1:21:59] but around him said but he didn't
[1:22:01] understand the scripture
[1:22:03] he said because the scripture's got to
[1:22:04] be fulfilled
[1:22:06] the scripture says that you know that
[1:22:08] the seed had to go into the ground
[1:22:12] and come forth in a multiple form you
[1:22:14] realize if that church had to went into
[1:22:16] the ground down through them ages you
[1:22:19] and I wouldn't be here today
[1:22:22] I don't care what you think
[1:22:27] but you see Church
[1:22:29] you mean a great God would sit back with
[1:22:31] his arms folded and watch Millions
[1:22:33] killed
[1:22:36] he wasn't sitting back
[1:22:39] he was down there with him
[1:22:42] damn it who was it was it polycar no not
[1:22:45] probably car which one was it was it
[1:22:47] burned at the state polycar
[1:22:51] and the fire would bend away from him
[1:22:59] and said his soul was seen leaving in
[1:23:02] the form of a dove
[1:23:04] or right up through the Flames all of
[1:23:08] the things
[1:23:10] you want these quotes right around said
[1:23:13] sometimes they was put to sleep he said
[1:23:15] they didn't even feel that
[1:23:18] you believe that
[1:23:19] he didn't even feel it
[1:23:23] that's how loving God
[1:23:25] he was right there with him
[1:23:28] and they didn't even feel that sting of
[1:23:30] death
[1:23:34] It's a Wonderful savior let's stand

[1:23:39] just preach a message straight across

[1:33:02] stomach sometimes need to be got out of
[1:33:04] there
[1:33:05] we went with Wade one time we've told
[1:33:07] you no he was running a high temperature
[1:33:09] I mean it just wouldn't and we missed
[1:33:12] church that day on account of him being
[1:33:14] you know so sick and and all and uh so
[1:33:19] we got a doctor's appointment and I was
[1:33:21] just praying and I was just young you
[1:33:22] know and the Lord and I said Lord we
[1:33:25] believe in doctors but just let
[1:33:27] everything before you touch that that
[1:33:30] doctor touch his Wade
[1:33:32] you let it all pass away
[1:33:35] I mean he was running high temperature
[1:33:37] he finally had average tonsils taken out
[1:33:38] into things you know but and we put ice
[1:33:41] around him you know and fixed him trying
[1:33:44] to help him
[1:33:45] we go up to the doctor's office and
[1:33:48] I don't understand her yet why that guy
[1:33:51] didn't get mad at a hornet but
[1:33:54] the doctor you know he met us there and
[1:33:56] he's a good doctor
[1:33:57] you know that was back when they'd meet
[1:34:00] you
[1:34:00] he met us at the office we walked in and
[1:34:03] just as we walked into the door and he
[1:34:06] started saying something to us and about
[1:34:08] that time we let it go and he just
[1:34:10] covered the place up vomiting you know
[1:34:13] and the doctor said well we'll do what
[1:34:15] we can for him but said it's all right
[1:34:16] everything's gone
[1:34:18] that's just the way he said it he says
[1:34:20] okay it's gone and you know what
[1:34:22] temperature
[1:34:24] and he said well Doctrine you know he
[1:34:26] gave him some medicine that's good
[1:34:30] because he just believe in him and him a
[1:34:32] little bit they can't believe sometimes
[1:34:34] for themselves so let's believe for them
[1:34:36] you know and just just remember these
[1:34:39] all right anything
[1:34:44] remember the fellowship meeting now and
[1:34:46] I say again if you're going please let
[1:34:48] us know do you the ones that are not
[1:34:49] here tonight if you're going to let us
[1:34:50] know because we're not going to sit and
[1:34:52] wait on you paste the time
[1:34:55] and we need to know before the time to
[1:34:57] where we can make arrangements you know
[1:35:00] if not then you can drive I don't have
[1:35:02] any problems and I'll give you money to
[1:35:04] buy the gas
[1:35:05] no problem
[1:35:07] but you just stop us from the doings
[1:35:09] because we have a set schedule
[1:35:12] and to go as far as we have to go over
[1:35:14] the mountains and think it just takes a
[1:35:16] long time
[1:35:17] takes a good three hours of hard driving
[1:35:20] to get there through the mountains
[1:35:22] you know it's not Interstate it's
[1:35:25] through the mountains so just you that
[1:35:27] are going if you're not going call us
[1:35:31] because if we're sitting there you know
[1:35:36] in our way in June's not going to go and
[1:35:39] you know I use them because I had no
[1:35:41] feelings about the rest of you
[1:35:45] and he don't call us we could leave at 9
[1:35:47] 30 because everybody's ready
[1:35:50] but he's
[1:35:51] I don't know I'm going or not
[1:35:54] I'll make up mine a little while
[1:36:00] the world don't evolve around me and you
[1:36:03] I like the way right around and said it
[1:36:05] he said if you think you're important
[1:36:07] take some water in a bowl and stick your
[1:36:11] finger in it and pull it out and find a
[1:36:14] hole
[1:36:17] that's how much we're thought of
[1:36:19] but yet we do everything we can to to
[1:36:22] help you in any way and do it but just
[1:36:25] remember that now leaving 10 o'clock
[1:36:26] okay
[1:36:28] all right
[1:36:28] Lord Jesus we love you we thank you for
[1:36:32] tonight we pray that what we've said
[1:36:34] would be acceptable in thy sight and
[1:36:36] Lord it's what we believe because it's
[1:36:39] what we've always believed about you
[1:36:42] that you didn't just
[1:36:44] drop mankind down on Earth and sling out
[1:36:47] a bunch of seed and let it fall
[1:36:50] you knew
[1:36:52] where that seed would fall in that
[1:36:54] little woman the prophet said
[1:36:57] but you knew she would say
[1:37:01] we know when the Messiah cometh
[1:37:04] and that was her connection because
[1:37:06] somebody had taught her that
[1:37:09] even till your Prophet was saying about
[1:37:11] the Virgin Mary there
[1:37:13] and her saying that she heard from her
[1:37:15] mother but then one day it was quickened
[1:37:19] a virgin shall conceive and she said
[1:37:21] that's that scripture
[1:37:23] and she believed it
[1:37:25] we thank you for your love and your
[1:37:26] grace unto us and we pray that you'd
[1:37:28] bless everybody on the way home give a
[1:37:30] safe journey give Journeys Mercy to
[1:37:32] these that are traveling like dick and
[1:37:33] Gail into different things Lord this
[1:37:35] coming weekend and I'll just bless each
[1:37:37] one we love you and we thank you in
[1:37:39] Jesus name
[1:37:41] you're dismissed
[1:37:59] Blessed Be the work of myself
