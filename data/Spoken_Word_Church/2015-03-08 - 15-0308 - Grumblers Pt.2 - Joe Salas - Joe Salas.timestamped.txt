[0:33] danger that's in his path and bring him
[0:35] home safe we ask all these things in
[0:38] Jesus name amen
[0:46] amen last time we were talking about um
[0:49] the grumblers complaining and um I'm not
[0:53] saying I hate to say but somebody
[0:55] complained that when they put
[0:58] the the DVD on on the car was crackling
[1:01] we were having problem with the the mic
[1:04] but the the camera was
[1:06] okay so we're going to kind of do a
[1:08] little bit of it so if I say something
[1:10] that I did last time maybe it didn't
[1:12] come in I I did listen to the C and it
[1:14] was crackling and they said it was
[1:15] cracking too
[1:18] so let's go
[1:20] to Exodus
[1:24] 2 we're going to do 13 to
[1:28] 14
[1:38] Exodus 213- 14 and when he went out of
[1:43] the out the second day behold two men of
[1:46] the Hebrews stro together and he said to
[1:49] him that did the wrong where wherefor
[1:53] smile thou Thy Thy fellow and he said
[1:57] who made thee a prince and a judge over
[1:59] us and
[2:01] tend us to kill me as thou killest the
[2:04] Egyptian and Moses feared and said
[2:06] surely this thing is
[2:09] known I didn't talk about this last time
[2:11] but I think there was the first time
[2:12] that uh that uh the children Israel
[2:16] complained to Moses and
[2:23] uh brother BR said uh Moses tried to do
[2:26] it on his own but he was a complete
[2:28] failure right MH
[2:39] okay in the message uh why Christ speak
[2:43] brother said God had called Moses
[2:45] special call and when God calls a man
[2:48] and anoints him for a certain Duty he
[2:50] expects that man to carry that out to
[2:52] the L God doesn't want to give a man a
[2:55] commission and him he h around about it
[2:58] he wants him to go straight forward and
[3:01] do just exactly what his commissioned to
[3:04] do he said don't look to the right or to
[3:06] the left just move forward and the
[3:09] children of Israel had been in bondage
[3:11] for some 400 years but God had promised
[3:14] that he would visit them and God keeps
[3:16] every promise that he made he cannot lie
[3:20] he's God and the time had come for this
[3:23] visitation he said now Moses was being
[3:25] called for this purpose he was a man God
[3:28] trained him 80 years before he ever was
[3:32] able to use him 40 years in the palace
[3:35] and 40 years in the wilderness said God
[3:38] trained a man might a taken a 100
[3:43] years for 40 minutes work God knows how
[3:46] to
[3:47] train what the schools had put in Moses
[3:50] 40 years it taken 40 years to get it out
[3:52] but one time in the presence of the
[3:54] anoint anointed one time the presence of
[3:58] the Bor birst he know know more about
[4:00] God than he had learned in the books in
[4:03] the 80 years of his life said God
[4:06] trained his man then anoints them gives
[4:08] them experience takes them through the
[4:11] riged training down through the Sands of
[4:13] burning
[4:15] punishment trying test it not only does
[4:18] he do that to His prophets but he does
[4:22] it to his children every son that cometh
[4:24] to God must be chasen and tried tested
[4:27] by his word see when the PIN came to
[4:30] the strong time when he faces dead are
[4:33] you able to stand there on the word of
[4:35] God say God said so that settles it and
[4:39] God called such a man and that man was
[4:41] Moses but Moses a great deal like us
[4:44] every time it come a place to something
[4:47] had to be done Moses called out oh Lord
[4:52] what must I do in this place now isn't
[4:54] that just like we do God blessed him and
[4:57] anointed him about his brother gave him
[5:00] a message and a Ministry that had not
[5:02] been on the earth since that day until
[5:05] that day and yet every time something
[5:07] taking place Moses run off to God with
[5:10] it Lord what must I do what must I do in
[5:13] this case God got kind of tired of it I
[5:17] believe said why are you crying to me
[5:20] speak to the people and go
[5:22] forward my if any time ever looked like
[5:26] they ought to retreat was then but God
[5:28] has no Retreat there's no place to
[5:31] retreating God go forward the doctor
[5:34] says it's cancer go forward if he says
[5:36] it's TV go forward if the devil says you
[5:40] can't give this up go forward your home
[5:44] say that you're going to be a
[5:46] fanatic go forward the church turns you
[5:49] out go forward there's no retreating
[5:51] back go forward speak and go forward
[5:55] speak what his word and go forward thou
[5:58] said the Lord and move
[6:02] on but the people then rebell said it
[6:05] had been better that we died in Egypt
[6:09] had been better that we had our Grace
[6:11] Mark than from the hyenas and vultures
[6:14] to pick our bones in the wilderness what
[6:17] did you bring us out here after they
[6:19] seen that God has approved Moses to be
[6:22] his
[6:26] servant and Moses Fred the people and
[6:29] the people FR to Moses and he said what
[6:31] would we do what must must we do and go
[6:35] forward was the answer now they said we
[6:38] are in the wilderness and armies of
[6:40] pharaohs approaching us their Camp just
[6:43] behind us but Moses knew to obey
[6:48] God Moses was called he and God then
[6:52] after Moses received his call he went
[6:55] out to Egypt then he's got to get the
[6:58] people to believe believe him now he was
[7:00] an anointed prophet of the Lord but the
[7:02] people didn't believe him though he he
[7:06] got proved it by signs and wonder that
[7:09] he did and because they didn't believe
[7:11] Moses as servant of the Lord then they
[7:13] fell in the wilderness and every one of
[7:15] them died that left Egypt not one of
[7:18] them was saved everyone died and
[7:21] perished besides Joshua and Caleb they
[7:23] started out because they murmur and
[7:26] complained against the Vindicated
[7:28] message of God had spoke in the
[7:32] Bible Moses was a signed post of the
[7:34] Deliverance of Israel according to God's
[7:37] word that TR that time Drew n God s
[7:40] Moses he was God like for that
[7:52] day I let this it was a great general of
[7:56] stone Stonewall Jackson who had been my
[7:59] favorite General since Joshua Stonewall
[8:03] Jackson was asked one time how can you
[8:05] stand with just a handful of men when
[8:07] the opposition is so great that's how he
[8:10] got his name stone wall he would not
[8:13] budge he knew not he knew no retreat
[8:17] what could we accredit a man like that
[8:20] to a man when the Yankees came down by
[8:23] the thousands and he stood there in a
[8:25] minority but they never moved him he
[8:28] stood like a ston wall all the rest of
[8:31] the rebels Army had retreated back Ryan
[8:34] come along and said what's the matter
[8:36] with Jackson why isn't he going he said
[8:39] he stands like a stone wall that's where
[8:42] he got his title the other GS asked him
[8:46] said Mr Jackson a little Bey fellow
[8:49] blackheaded and blue eye only was about
[8:52] 5 ft maybe like me I don't
[8:56] know five five point 2 Ines tall very
[9:00] modest mild speaky little fellow said Mr
[9:03] Jackson how can you stand in such a
[9:06] position bashful like he kicked his boot
[9:09] on the ground he said I never take a
[9:12] drink of water unless I thank the Lord
[9:14] for it do we do
[9:18] that that's where it is there's no
[9:20] retreating God speak and go forward
[9:23] that's right that's God's commission to
[9:25] his church we have no time to slap
[9:34] let's go to numbers
[9:58] 11
[10:04] let's say 1 2
[10:14] three I said that one last week I don't
[10:16] want to repeat too much
[10:19] 11 and when the people complain it
[10:22] displeased the Lord and said and the
[10:25] Lord heard it and his anger was kindled
[10:28] and the fire of the Lord burned among
[10:31] them and consumed them that were in the
[10:33] uttermost part of the camp and the
[10:36] people Cried unto
[10:38] Moses and when Moses prayed unto the
[10:41] Lord the fire was quenched and he called
[10:43] the name of the place T because the fire
[10:48] of the Lord burned among
[10:54] them in uh
[10:57] numbers uh 12 uh 1 to 15 uh we read the
[11:02] this this last week uh Aaron and Maran
[11:08] complain
[11:09] uh complain the most because of the E
[11:13] woman he married but I'm going read that
[11:15] cuz we that last last
[11:19] time let's go to numbers
[11:27] 20
[11:34] 1-
[11:43] 12 this one one of my favorite
[11:46] scriptures then came the children of
[11:48] Israel even the whole congregation into
[11:50] the desert of Canan in the first month
[11:52] and the people in Cades and Mar and
[11:55] died there and was buried there there
[11:58] was no water for for the
[12:00] congregation and they gathered
[12:03] themselves together against Moses and
[12:04] against Aaron and the people
[12:07] CH with Moses and spec saying when God
[12:11] that we had died when our Brethren died
[12:14] before the
[12:15] Lord and why have you brought us the
[12:18] congregation of the Lord into this
[12:19] Wilderness that we and our cattle should
[12:22] die there and where have you made us to
[12:25] come out of Egypt to bring us into this
[12:28] evil place it is no place of seed or
[12:30] figs or mines or pomegranates neither is
[12:33] there any water to drink and Moses and
[12:36] Aron went from the prison of the
[12:38] assembly unto the door of the Tabernacle
[12:40] the congregation they fell upon their
[12:42] faces and the glory of the Lord appeared
[12:45] unto them and the Lord spake unto Moses
[12:49] saying take the rod and gather the
[12:51] assembly together thou and Aaron th
[12:55] brother and speak ye unto the rock
[12:58] before the eyes and he shall give forth
[13:00] his water and I shall bring forth to
[13:02] them speak unto the rock not SM you know
[13:06] which the rock is
[13:10] Christ what are the rocks that thou
[13:12] shalt give the congregation their be
[13:14] drink and Moses took the rod from the
[13:17] before the Lord and as he commanded him
[13:21] and Moses and Aaron gathered the
[13:22] congregation together before the Rock
[13:24] and he said unto them here now ye Rebels
[13:27] must we f you fet you water out of this
[13:31] rock and Moses lifted up his hand and
[13:34] with his Rod he smoke the rock twice he
[13:37] can only crucify Christ once so Moses
[13:41] broke the scriptures right there which
[13:43] caus them to going to the promis
[13:52] land and the water came out abundantly
[13:55] and the congregation drank and their
[13:57] Beast also and the the Lord spake unto
[14:00] Moses and Aaron because you believe me
[14:02] not to sanctify me in the eyes of the
[14:04] children of Israel therefore you shall
[14:07] not bring this congregation into the
[14:09] land which I have given
[14:27] thee and the message as I was with
[14:32] Moses brother says uh no matter what
[14:36] Moses done it was Moses office that God
[14:39] respected he was a prophet he was above
[14:42] all the prophets he was really more than
[14:44] any Prophet they had he said when his
[14:48] own sister left at him for Mar and E
[14:50] theop girl he he called him to that he
[14:53] said don't you fear God said there be
[14:57] one among you who is spiritual or a
[14:59] prophet I will speak to him in a vision
[15:01] and make myself known to him in dreams
[15:04] but it's not so with Moses I speak le Li
[15:08] to ear with him don't you fear God see
[15:12] that's not a good thing to upon
[15:15] God's people you heard him when you do
[15:17] so God had commissioned Moses his
[15:20] failures meant nothing God know KNN his
[15:24] heart so even though whatever Moses did
[15:28] that was till God respected the
[15:39] office let's do uh Exodus
[15:44] 16
[15:57] 2230
[16:02] Exodus 16:22
[16:07] to30 and it came to pass that on the
[16:09] sixth day they gathered twice as much
[16:12] bread two arms for one man and all the
[16:15] rulers of the congregation came and told
[16:18] Moses and he said unto them this is that
[16:20] that which the Lord had said tomorrow is
[16:23] the rest of the holy Sabbath unto the
[16:26] Lord they that which you will beg today
[16:31] and seek that you should will s and that
[16:35] which remained overlay up for you to
[16:38] keep until the morning and they laid it
[16:41] upon they laid it till the morning as
[16:44] Moses bit and it did not stink neither
[16:46] was there any warm therein and Moses
[16:49] said eat to they for the today is the
[16:54] Sabbath unto the Lord today you should
[16:56] not find it in the field
[16:59] six days You Shall Gather but on the
[17:02] seventh day which is be seven and there
[17:05] be shall be none and it came to pass
[17:08] that there went out some people on the
[17:10] seventh day for together and they found
[17:13] none they still don't obey God they
[17:15] still didn't say what Moses
[17:17] says and the Lord said unto Moses how
[17:20] long refuse you to keep my
[17:23] Commandments see for the Lord had given
[17:26] you the Sabbath therefore he give it you
[17:29] on the sixth day the bread of two days
[17:32] let no man go out of his place on the
[17:35] seventh day so the people rested on
[17:38] the seventh
[17:43] day Exodus
[17:47] 17
[17:49] 1 one
[17:53] two
[17:55] seven and all the congregation of the
[17:57] children of Israel Journey from the
[17:59] Wilderness of s after their Journey
[18:01] according to the Commandment of the Lord
[18:03] and
[18:05] pitching what put all the hard names I
[18:07] can't
[18:12] pronounce and there was no water for the
[18:15] people to drink wherefore the people
[18:18] child with Moses and said give us water
[18:20] that we may drink and Moses said unto
[18:22] them why sh with me sh with me wherefore
[18:26] do you tempt the Lord and they people
[18:28] thirsted there for water and the people
[18:30] murmur against Moses
[18:32] and and said wherefore is this that thou
[18:36] has brought us up out of the Egypt to
[18:38] kill us and our children our cattle with
[18:41] thirst and Moses cried onto the Lord no
[18:45] wonder brother made that message why
[18:48] Christ speak c
[18:51] c and Moses Cried unto the Lord saying
[18:54] what shall I do unto these people they
[18:55] be almost ready to Stone me and the Lord
[18:58] said unto Moses go on before the people
[19:01] and take with thee of the Elders of
[19:04] Israel and thy rod where wherefore thou
[19:07] smartest the river take that in thy hand
[19:10] and go behold I will stand before thee
[19:14] there upon the rock in her and thou shal
[19:17] Smite The Rock and there shall come
[19:19] water out of it that the people may
[19:22] drink and Moses did show in the sight of
[19:25] the Elders of Israel and he called the
[19:28] name of the place Messiah and Mara
[19:32] because of the CH of the children of
[19:34] Israel and because they tempted the Lord
