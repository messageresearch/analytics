[5:58] with us today and fellowshipping some of
[6:00] Brother Anderson sister Anna's crowd we
[6:02] had a good time last night in the Bible
[6:05] study we had more visitors that about it
[6:07] and we did have our own people you know
[6:10] to fellowship and had a good time in
[6:13] doing that together in the Bible study
[6:16] but we say to you welcome now some of
[6:18] you are not visitors because you've been
[6:20] here before and you know how we do that
[6:22] we say if you come one time you're
[6:23] visitor two times you're part of us so
[6:26] that just makes it to be the whole point
[6:29] right good to have everybody or some
[6:32] back like brother dick n from vacations
[6:34] others now there's a good many missing
[6:36] today uh that are gone to youth camps
[6:39] and things so remember each one of them
[6:42] you know the the families and the things
[6:44] that they all get a uh a safe trip back
[6:48] and everything will be all right
[6:50] remember that okay now the fellowship
[6:52] meeting will be the third Saturday of
[6:55] this month it will be at brother page
[6:59] so remember that the third Saturday they
[7:02] start at 3:30 we'll leave here about at
[7:05] least by 12:30 to be able to be there so
[7:09] if you want to ride this it's a very
[7:11] short one this time but still the time
[7:14] we stop and eat it ties up and if you
[7:17] don't stop and eat you're going to have
[7:18] to eat before you get started so we
[7:21] generally always try to uh get
[7:23] everything set up we'll stop in
[7:25] Gainsville somewhere and get about to
[7:27] eat all right that's on the third
[7:28] Saturday
[7:29] so remember that and I uh pray that the
[7:32] Lord would bless each one and guide us
[7:35] all in his love all right uh we thank
[7:38] God for this tomorrow being the 4th of
[7:41] July being Independence Day we thank God
[7:45] for that that we too at this time still
[7:48] have our independence and thanking God
[7:50] for the freedom that we do have it may
[7:53] be fast being taken from us but we still
[7:56] have a lot more than most of the world
[7:59] have
[7:59] so we thank God for that you know and
[8:01] all it's been done to make it all all
[8:04] the lives it's been given to bring us to
[8:07] an independence day but see that's
[8:10] tomorrow because that would be our 4th
[8:12] of July and we started here July the 4th
[8:17] 1971 in the services here at the church
[8:20] so that means a lot to us about
[8:22] independence day but just remember
[8:25] Independence Day is the day you're born
[8:28] again that's the Independence that we
[8:30] want that's the dependence upon him to
[8:33] make you and I to be the children of God
[8:37] and that's that's the great part of it
[8:39] right so we thank God for him allowing
[8:42] us to have the time and to hear the word
[8:45] and and receive all of those things uh I
[8:49] guess that's all the announcements
[8:51] anything else remember the the things
[8:53] are downstairs for the uh announcement
[8:56] in October when we're going on on the
[8:59] train ride so we hope everybody will

[9:05] everything and we can go up and ride
[9:07] through the mountains and just have a
[9:08] good time together as fellowshipping as
[9:11] the body of Christ all right now
[9:16] uh okay I guess that's all and I got a
[9:19] whole bunch written down anyway so maybe
[9:21] I've announced enough anyway so the Lord
[9:23] willing brother Aaron will be

[9:47] of things of our independence day but
[9:50] today is the day of salvation so we
[9:52] thank you for that and we love you and
[9:54] we just ask that you would bless each
[9:56] one remember the sick among us we know
[9:58] that there's many many sicknesses that

[10:44] honeymoon how much 60 60th oh I didn't
[10:48] know y'all was that old
[10:51] anyhow it was good all right Revelations
[10:54] 3:14 and then second Peter okay and unto
[10:58] the angel Ang of the Church of the lady
[11:00] of sin right these things sayith the
[11:02] amen the faithful and true witness the
[11:05] beginning of the creation of God and
[11:07] like I say then if he was the beginning
[11:09] brother Brown said we are the
[11:11] continuation of that creation all right
[11:14] so now we go over here in Peter to think
[11:17] about this new creation that we are in
[11:20] Christ Jesus and watch now where Peter
[11:23] is addressing this Simon Peter a servant
[11:25] and Apostle of Jesus Christ who to them
[11:28] that have aain like Precious Faith so
[11:32] whatever Peter had these people have
[11:34] that this is not addressed to the world
[11:38] right the world cannot be partakers of
[11:41] God's divine nature the world needs to
[11:42] be born again you got to do that first
[11:45] and that's what he's saying these are to
[11:46] people that are born again this is not
[11:48] written to just anybody all right that
[11:51] have obtained like Precious Faith where
[11:53] with us through the righteousness of God
[11:57] and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and
[11:59] peace be multiplied unto you through the
[12:01] knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord
[12:05] now watch him according as his divine
[12:07] power hath given unto all us all things
[12:12] that pertain unto life now he's GI it's
[12:14] there free Li unto life and godliness
[12:17] through the knowledge of him that hath
[12:19] called us to glory and virtue now we're
[12:22] called to this position right see
[12:26] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[12:28] great and precious promises that by
[12:31] these you might be partakers of the
[12:33] divine nature having escaped the
[12:36] corruption that is in the world through
[12:38] lust and brother brand on the message of
[12:40] the position in Christ he said after we
[12:43] come into the body of Christ then he
[12:46] expects us to have his divine nature all
[12:49] right now watch
[12:51] him and beside this given all diligence
[12:54] add to your faith virtue into virtue
[12:56] knowledge into knowledge Temperance and
[12:58] temp Temperance patience and patience
[13:00] godliness and godliness brotherly
[13:02] kindness and brotherly kindness charity
[13:05] for if these things be in you and abound
[13:08] they make ye that she shall neither be
[13:10] Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[13:13] of our Lord Jesus Christ you may be
[13:16] seated the Lord add his Blessing to the
[13:20] reading of the
[13:21] word now to not back up a whole lot but
[13:26] yet to um you know not carry on and go
[13:30] on through um to our visitors a good
[13:33] many are here today and like I said we
[13:35] had almost as many lies not of visitors
[13:38] in the Bible study and I hope they had a
[13:40] good time and and us just because that's
[13:42] the Bible study to us as you sitting
[13:45] around and just fellowshipping and
[13:47] asking questions and commenting and and
[13:50] that way and you know your sisters you
[13:52] have just as much right there to
[13:54] question and talk about as us Brothers
[13:57] it's just a fellowship time
[13:59] to be able to uh talk about these things
[14:03] and a lot of times uh it does relate
[14:06] over
[14:07] into the message that we're preaching
[14:10] and the things so then that's that's
[14:13] good and if you want to copy of
[14:15] that then it is available to where that
[14:19] you must request it from brother Joe or
[14:22] one other of them Brother Richard and
[14:23] him and they'll make uh you a copy of
[14:26] the Bible study that you can hear us as
[14:29] we discuss things you know and it gets
[14:32] kind of comical sometimes and and all
[14:34] and we just have a good time because I
[14:37] don't see why we can't do that to
[14:39] fellowship and to do and all but if you
[14:42] want that also too now last Sun last
[14:45] Wednesday's message you cannot pull it
[14:49] up at this time on the
[14:52] video it it was something happening
[14:55] they're working trying to make sure that
[14:57] it has happened one time before that we
[14:59] lose the video part we still have the
[15:02] audio it is there but we don't have the
[15:06] video part of it and they're trying to
[15:07] work upon uh a system to where we'll
[15:10] have two systems cuz that's really what
[15:13] we have back here see in the back we
[15:15] have a thing set up to copy ever
[15:19] service on the audio that's separate
[15:22] from the internet to where that we make
[15:25] sure that we have a copy of the services
[15:30] now I I've done that for years because I
[15:32] want you to do and if anybody on the
[15:35] internet system desires any of these
[15:37] things go on the internet you'll see
[15:39] that they're there from about 2002 on
[15:42] down to now and you can check out to see
[15:45] whether I've changed my Doctrine or
[15:47] whatever I've tried to teach to you for
[15:50] all of those years they're available
[15:51] whatever you want to do with them you
[15:53] can listen but I have them there for
[15:55] another purpose too you come up and say
[15:56] brother Dale you said so and so
[15:59] I said well let's go get the
[16:01] tape you know see you say well I heard
[16:04] you say it okay let's go play the tape
[16:08] if I said it I'd be glad to apologize
[16:10] you know but let's go play the tape well
[16:12] you know what I've never had to play the
[16:14] tape yet cuz I guess anybody figures if
[16:18] you're Stern enough to say let's play
[16:20] the tape that you know you pretty well
[16:22] know where you're standing so you know
[16:24] that don't make us right it just makes
[16:26] us safe I like to be sa about everything
[16:30] to keep everything in order and then
[16:32] that way you can check out to see if
[16:33] I've changed my Doctrine right you know
[16:37] and and see what you want to because
[16:38] it's they're available in all of the
[16:41] years because we just not that we're
[16:43] trying to uh Pastor anything but just
[16:46] open it up to where that if anybody
[16:48] wants to listen you're welcome to listen
[16:51] all right at least then you'll know what
[16:53] I
[16:54] believe now if you're honest and think
[16:56] about it if you ask some some of your
[16:58] pastors before you came here you ask
[17:01] them what they believe and you generally
[17:02] didn't get a good answer cuz a lot of
[17:05] them but just you know uh most preachers
[17:08] won't tell you what to
[17:10] believe
[17:12] right well that's one thing I do right
[17:15] or wrong good or bad I tell you what I
[17:18] believe and you say well brother Dale
[17:19] like one brother one time wanted to
[17:21] question me in a ministers meeting we
[17:23] were having and it was designed for that
[17:25] to try to jump me and I I I knew about
[17:28] it knew beforehand and Nana knew about
[17:31] it nanny did and Anna even knew about it
[17:34] and they both told me and said they're
[17:35] trying to trap you I said well I'll give
[17:38] you my word that I will not say
[17:41] nothing I said I'll give you my word
[17:43] right now that I know what their plans
[17:45] are they were planning on to attack me
[17:48] on a doctor old isue and I said I won't
[17:51] answer them so the brothers kept on kept
[17:54] on at the meeting that day to try to get
[17:55] me to to do and I said listen Brothers
[18:00] I just have to repeat the same thing
[18:02] I've already
[18:03] said you know you know what I've already
[18:06] taught and if you wanted to know what I
[18:08] already taught it's there and and
[18:11] there's no need of me going over it
[18:13] again CU I've always taught it this way
[18:16] well that pretty well put a stop to the
[18:18] to the point but you know I just like to
[18:20] be that way I think it ought to be I
[18:22] thank God for the fact that we live in
[18:25] the day and the time and the age and the
[18:27] situation I thank God that he sent a
[18:30] prophet to America because what if he'd
[18:33] sent him to some of these other foreign
[18:34] countries there would have been no
[18:36] ability to capture the message they
[18:38] would have been no ability to do
[18:40] anything you would have just had Word of
[18:42] Mouth things or whatever was written but
[18:45] look what we have we have the ability to
[18:48] pull up everything the prophet taught
[18:50] from like
[18:51] 47 you know up to the end and and all
[18:55] like that and thank God for that we can
[18:58] you know come to that point and that's
[19:00] why I do like I'm doing now see there is
[19:03] an argument among the people of the
[19:05] message to the visitors that we're doing
[19:07] there's an argument among the Believers
[19:09] of the message over this little Point
[19:11] called the stature of a perfect man
[19:13] second Peter some say well I got all of
[19:16] this when I was born
[19:18] again I have all of these things they I
[19:21] got them when I was born again the other
[19:23] group says we don't have them
[19:25] yet well why not just somewhere get in
[19:28] the middle yeah and be able to believe
[19:31] all the word of God there's quotes for
[19:33] this there's quotes for that but what
[19:35] about a reality in our hearts and lives
[19:38] we read it and Peter said add to your
[19:41] faith virtue knowledge well if you
[19:43] already had it then why was he writing
[19:45] for them to receive it all right that
[19:48] brings it into but we are not to the
[19:52] position as a body holder of the Church
[19:54] of Jesus Christ maybe to where the faith
[19:57] of the father others were I'll agree
[20:00] with that so then that puts these quotes
[20:02] some right and this right but bring it
[20:04] in the middle of the road and bring it
[20:06] to our lives and situation of where
[20:08] we're
[20:09] at all right see then we can establish
[20:13] then the things because as we went
[20:16] through this so far coming up through
[20:18] this we're over to brotherly kindness
[20:20] now and we spent quite a time with the
[20:24] message where brother Brandon would say
[20:26] like paragraph 142 143 of the Statue of
[20:29] a perfect man he says have faith and be
[20:31] born again he said you're only laying
[20:34] the foundation well you can look at the
[20:37] pyramid and you can see the things and
[20:39] you say how faith and be born again see
[20:41] like I said some believe that we get all
[20:43] of this when we're the day we're born
[20:44] again as newborn babies well why you
[20:46] want to grow in Grace and knowledge you
[20:48] know to come and in your prophets when
[20:50] it said it I didn't he said the holy go
[20:53] The Headstone had not come yet well you
[20:56] say well we've got everything just like
[20:58] the apostles well I'll go along with you
[21:01] if you'll divide the day of
[21:03] Pentecost cuz on the day of Pentecost
[21:05] you
[21:06] got 120 that had been
[21:10] tutored when they received the Holy
[21:12] Ghost it put them that's what we call
[21:14] the faith of the fathers and brother
[21:16] rown said they had these
[21:18] virtues but they didn't have the
[21:19] headstone okay you say well you mean
[21:22] they didn't have the headstone back
[21:23] there no that's what your Prophet said I
[21:26] didn't make those statements well I I
[21:29] think they had the headstone I think
[21:30] Paul had it well I didn't answer that
[21:33] brother Rams wouldn't said it see in
[21:36] opinions is is is something to talk
[21:39] about but it's not Truth All right but
[21:42] see he says how faith and be born again
[21:45] he said you're only laying the
[21:47] foundation then he goes on to paragraph
[21:49] 176 178 read the message statue of a
[21:53] perfect man he said these are the things
[21:56] that God expects for us to
[21:59] add as these things all right so now
[22:02] it's
[22:03] simple if we are to add them we didn't
[22:06] have
[22:07] them that's plain language I I like to
[22:09] make things
[22:11] blunt you know and you well who are you
[22:14] well love me who are you like we were
[22:16] talking about last night a question was
[22:18] asked about uh the
[22:22] uh standing at the Judgment seat of
[22:25] Christ well we had to express the
[22:27] message part of it cuz you see we'd say
[22:30] the Bible says we'll all stand at the
[22:32] Judgment seat of
[22:33] Christ all right
[22:36] now according to the Bible and according
[22:40] to the prophet the bride doesn't stand
[22:42] before the white Throne judgment right
[22:46] so there must be another
[22:49] judgment that's not interpreting
[22:51] something that's imp pling
[22:55] sense are you going to put everybody at
[22:57] the white throne
[22:58] MH see if you do then you're contrary to
[23:01] the Bible cuz you're not perfect see cuz
[23:04] you'd have to stand at the white throne
[23:06] for something to happen and your Prophet
[23:08] emphatically States over and over the
[23:09] bride does not stand at to White Throne
[23:11] judgment she sets on the Judgment
[23:13] according to the Bible with him judging
[23:15] others see that to me is sensible then
[23:18] that's right amen then when you say you
[23:21] know this to the visitors a point see
[23:23] when you say well I I've I got all these
[23:27] when I born again well what does it mean
[23:29] to
[23:32] add see you say I got it I got it just
[23:35] like the discipled like I said 120
[23:39] received it because of the word they
[23:41] heard 3,000 received it and that put
[23:45] them at
[23:46] Faith amen because they were not tutored
[23:49] by the
[23:50] word now that's simple to me yes you
[23:53] know and and and that answers a lot of
[23:56] the questions of why we're here what
[23:58] this like we've talking about last night
[24:00] then it answers the question of what why
[24:02] we're here 50 years after the prophet's
[24:05] gone evidently according to the prophet
[24:08] there was only thing one thing holding
[24:10] off the coming of the Lord and he said
[24:13] it was the Readiness of the Bride that's
[24:14] right amen so evidently that's our
[24:17] problem that's right and that's the only
[24:19] thing that I'm trying to say now is we
[24:21] need these
[24:23] virtues that's right Peter spoke of it
[24:26] and we need them we have to have
[24:29] them it's not a choice of saying well we
[24:32] might to do this no but remember how
[24:35] we've taught it to you too that you
[24:37] can't say well okay and there's a
[24:40] Doctrine in the message that people say
[24:42] we're born again right up here where it
[24:45] says lady
[24:47] OA he that put us right to our brotherly
[24:50] kindness well that
[24:53] didn't I don't see how you can say we're
[24:56] bornn in a certain age that makes us
[24:59] that
[25:01] no see you got to get it in the right
[25:03] order to bringing it to a point all
[25:06] right now then bringing it down what we
[25:08] situation we've come down through is you
[25:12] add to your
[25:13] faith see faith is not an
[25:16] ad we'll get to the mathematical
[25:19] calculations later of the nine things
[25:22] that you
[25:23] see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 n
[25:29] you're looking at the pyramid that's
[25:31] right but there's only seven ads your
[25:33] Prophet said all
[25:36] right he said only seven Church ages all
[25:39] right see we'll get to those as we go
[25:41] along in the message but to just back up
[25:43] enough to people to understand what
[25:46] we're doing you see then you must add to
[25:49] your faith
[25:51] amen faith is not an ad that's a birth a
[25:54] baby is born a baby but it does does not
[25:58] have any
[25:59] virtues it is simply a baby it grows
[26:03] into the virtues of life in the natural
[26:08] so as a Christian is born again as a
[26:12] baby and you say well I've got this or
[26:14] I've got that you can have those things
[26:16] and not even be born again remember
[26:19] that's in Blasphemous names and stature
[26:21] of perfect man that you can have a
[26:22] portion of these things and not even
[26:24] born again at all all right but you see
[26:27] that it takes the new birth to bring it
[26:30] amen and then when it when you get that
[26:32] New Birth now you're in the place to
[26:35] grow right amen so you add to your faith
[26:38] virtue to Virtue knowledge but see what
[26:41] we think we just take add to your faith
[26:45] knowledge you remember how we've been
[26:47] covering that you say well I'll just I I
[26:49] don't need to worry about these other
[26:50] things I'll just add knowledge and then
[26:52] I'll add godliness and and I I might
[26:54] play around with a bloodly kind of no
[26:59] remember you don't go up a
[27:02] ladder two or three
[27:05] rungs you going to slip and fall you go
[27:07] up the ladder one rung at a time you go
[27:11] up the Christian ladder one layer or
[27:14] rung or what you want to call it at the
[27:16] time that's right the prophet said you
[27:18] try to add brotherly kindness he
[27:21] said and he said if these are not right
[27:23] here he said they'll all crumble that's
[27:26] right amen that's in statue of perfect
[27:28] man he said it'll all crumble why
[27:30] because it's not correct back behind but
[27:32] if you build everything according to
[27:34] each one in its place see that's right
[27:37] then God doesn't require us to have
[27:40] knowledge and that's not head knowledge
[27:43] that's Holy Ghost knowledge he doesn't
[27:45] require that until you have virtue what
[27:47] is
[27:48] virtue not a virgin life the prophet
[27:51] covers it it's the fact of Christ Living
[27:54] in
[27:55] us to make us what we have need of Being
[27:58] for the time then you add brotherly kind
[28:01] I mean you add knowledge to that and see
[28:04] then you come on to knowledge before you
[28:06] have required to have
[28:08] Temperance well bless God when I got
[28:10] born again I ain't had no Temperance
[28:12] since
[28:13] then
[28:15] yeah you just hang around me a little
[28:17] while and you'll find
[28:19] out I'll find a way to tell where that
[28:21] Temperance is right or
[28:24] not cuz that's what the Bible said about
[28:26] trying of your Faith worketh patience
[28:29] all right trying of your Revelation all
[28:32] right but get the point so you don't get
[28:34] this and in Jump way up here everybody
[28:37] understand a baby doesn't go from year
[28:40] one and you take it down it's the year
[28:43] old you take it down to the school and
[28:45] said now September when it starts we're
[28:47] going to put this baby oh we're going to
[28:49] bypass the the kindergarten cuz they
[28:52] don't need it we're going to put them in
[28:54] the first well let's don't put them in
[28:55] the first let's put about third grade
[28:58] boy that's really good it's Oney
[29:01] old you say you're silly no that's the
[29:03] way Christian Life that's the way people
[29:06] explain the Christian Life
[29:09] right when you're born again the Bible
[29:11] calls it an Earnest a baby to desire the
[29:15] sincere milk of the word that you may
[29:19] grow thereby all right so is it with the
[29:22] stature of a perfect man see to grow in
[29:26] it right and the prophet says it uh on
[29:29] the message let's see uh looking under
[29:32] Jesus he said all you got to do is just
[29:35] keep drinking in and said these things
[29:37] will be pushed
[29:39] out just keep inhaling the
[29:42] word as you take the word it'll push out
[29:44] the things we have need of right but
[29:47] everybody with me now you don't have to
[29:49] you don't try to jump the rung and go to
[29:51] another that's right God if you try to
[29:53] go to to Temperance without having
[29:56] knowledge then you think Temperance
[29:58] means don't drink
[30:01] alcohol the prophet says that's not what
[30:03] it means in this case he said it's
[30:07] that temper you have Blasphemous names
[30:10] he said it's that
[30:12] ungodly
[30:14] uncontrollable temper you have just
[30:17] remember how we went through what is the
[30:19] one member of the body that is never
[30:21] been able to be
[30:25] controlled the tongue
[30:29] right you remember what Jack Co that
[30:31] lady said said then my tongue is my
[30:33] problem and said I want to lay it on the
[30:35] altar he said ma'am he said this pull
[30:37] Pit's only 14 ft he said there ain't
[30:40] enough
[30:42] room well he was telling the truth
[30:44] wasn't
[30:45] he that's the thing is not been
[30:48] controlled by
[30:50] mankind all right because it's the
[30:54] problem with us is that all right now
[30:57] now so then we're expected then as we
[31:00] come up we're expected then as we grow
[31:03] these are supposed to be brought into
[31:05] existence and remember when we got to
[31:09] Godliness you remember that we got to
[31:12] Godliness and brother Brandon says what
[31:15] he said you come all this
[31:19] way you come all the way up to here
[31:21] before God expects you to be Godly then
[31:25] we went through be you therefore perfect
[31:26] even as your father in Heaven is
[31:29] perfect well ain't none of us perfect
[31:32] and that's what I kept emphasizing the
[31:33] other day we say they ain't none of us
[31:36] perfect we're just forgiven you see that
[31:38] on the tags don't you and you say oh
[31:40] that's a great
[31:43] statement is that a great statement or
[31:45] is that
[31:48] stupidity come
[31:50] on if you're
[31:53] forgiven it means it's wiped out right
[31:57] it's in the sea of God's forgetfulness
[31:59] if you're
[32:00] forgiven well then if you're forgiven
[32:03] you're not guilty if you're not guilty
[32:05] you're
[32:06] perfect that's
[32:08] right the only way to be perfect is
[32:10] through the blood of Jesus
[32:13] Christ
[32:15] right but if we don't confess what he
[32:19] says
[32:21] amen then we went through it there the
[32:23] point of godliness the brother R said
[32:26] you come all this way
[32:28] he said now he expects you to be like
[32:30] God well I was like God down here at the
[32:33] bottom I remember when
[32:35] iten but there's more to the
[32:40] story remember what we were talking
[32:42] about to be like
[32:45] God do you know that the Bible says that
[32:49] people have a form of
[32:52] godliness and deny the power
[32:55] thereof that's second
[32:58] Timothy uh 3 and 5 I
[33:01] guess to have a form of
[33:04] godliness what is a form of godliness
[33:07] but not having the power thereof and the
[33:09] situation exists there these are ones
[33:12] that go about doing this creep into
[33:13] houses they doing they lead captive
[33:16] silly women all like
[33:18] that that's certainly not God kind of
[33:21] godliness is
[33:23] it but remember how we were bringing out
[33:25] you say well
[33:28] they have a form of godliness the kind o
[33:31] priest did right you could not condemn
[33:34] the kind o priest of anything Jesus
[33:36] never condemned him of anything did did
[33:39] Jesus tell Nicodemus any of his
[33:44] faults am I right now he didn't tell
[33:47] Nicodemus any faults he had why cuz he
[33:50] didn't have
[33:51] any his only fault was that he needed to
[33:54] be born
[33:55] again
[33:58] right right see then that way you can
[34:01] look at it and see that Jesus wasn't not
[34:03] condemning him for his life because his
[34:05] life was right
[34:08] right see you can have a form of
[34:11] godliness you can act like God you can
[34:13] be forgiven I mean forgive people and be
[34:16] great and have a great nature about you
[34:18] and all kind of things and you look at
[34:20] the kind old priest and look how great
[34:22] he
[34:23] was you know but then Jesus comes along
[34:26] plats a rope together runs them out of
[34:28] the
[34:31] temple but just
[34:33] remember now he was
[34:36] God right amen you say well the nature
[34:40] of God wasn't displayed that day that
[34:43] was the nature of a man no that was the
[34:46] nature of
[34:49] God because he said you make my house A
[34:52] din of
[34:53] Thieves let me set quote brother random
[34:55] you know what he become by doing that
[34:57] you know what brother R said that Jesus
[35:00] become what he done a deacon you need
[35:03] that quote he said he become a deacon
[35:06] you know why cuz he he's supposed to
[35:07] take care of everything doing his office
[35:10] and things all right you see the message
[35:12] has given us the answers to a lot of the
[35:15] questions we thought
[35:17] about all right and what about a God
[35:20] that is so great of a God that could
[35:22] utterly destroy a whole nation men women
[35:26] children babies and everything wipe them
[35:28] out that's
[35:30] right but yet he's
[35:33] God now who can condemn him but to our
[35:36] eyes the kind o priest was a better guy
[35:39] he had more godliness the way we
[35:43] think than Jesus
[35:45] had
[35:47] right but that won't work that's right
[35:50] see his godliness was without power
[35:52] without the love of God without the
[35:55] strength of God without the virtue of
[35:57] God that's right he had natural virtue
[36:01] that's right Blasphemous name says you
[36:03] can have it statue perfect man says you
[36:05] can have natural virtues and
[36:09] things but we need it with God and other
[36:12] words we don't need a knowledge until we
[36:15] first get a virtue that's
[36:19] right then we need knowledge am right
[36:23] well but I want I'm coming up this way
[36:25] come on quit playing G
[36:29] games you can play games and say when a
[36:31] baby's born it's got everything that'll
[36:33] ever had
[36:34] amen but it ain't grown enough to use
[36:37] it all right so don't play with the
[36:40] games with me or saying well when I got
[36:42] born again I had these things in a
[36:44] potential okay we'll go along with you
[36:47] if you'll go along with me on one thing
[36:50] a potential is not a real
[36:54] thing if a potential is never developed
[36:57] into a full thing it is not real right
[37:01] so we don't play with words we take it
[37:03] straight that's right and try to
[37:05] comprehend what is being said all right
[37:08] so we come and the prophet said we come
[37:09] all the way up here now he's expecting
[37:12] us to be
[37:14] perfect you remember that Matthew 5:48
[37:18] be therefore perfect oh but it's none of
[37:20] us perfect we're just
[37:23] forgiven you see that's carnal mankind
[37:28] right come on if you're forgiven like I
[37:31] said I talking about brother collie I
[37:32] said now brother collie I can say
[37:35] brother colie robbed the bank today well
[37:36] he didn't rob the
[37:38] bank he's
[37:40] perfect he ain't guilty he's perfect
[37:43] perfect doesn't just mean you done it
[37:46] and then are
[37:48] forgiven come on we got the message go
[37:51] into invisible Union on the message of
[37:54] justification right come on and what
[37:57] does he say on the invisible Union of
[38:00] justification you start off chopping off
[38:02] your pie sin that's fine but after while
[38:04] it comes what it says though you never
[38:07] done it that's right that's when he puts
[38:09] in the SE of forgi but what about the
[38:11] lies part we don't study that part of
[38:13] the future of the invisible Union going
[38:15] to where he said the real you never did
[38:16] do it that's right amen now who's the
[38:18] real you right the god that's living in
[38:22] you is a real you right so that's why a
[38:25] believer in a born again believer is
[38:27] perfectly totally sinless that's right
[38:30] that don't mean we don't do wrong right
[38:32] we do that every day cuz that's the
[38:34] human
[38:35] elements but inside of us is eternal
[38:38] life and that's what he's doing inside
[38:40] of us now adding the word to push out to
[38:43] bring these virtues into being all right
[38:47] now so we're up to that point of
[38:50] thinking and see I want to drop back
[38:53] though cuz I want you to think on these
[38:54] things and I'll try to run through them
[38:56] in a hurry and we don't have to read
[38:57] them but we'll if they throw them up
[38:59] then you'll be able to read it on
[39:01] Blasphemous
[39:02] names paragraph
[39:05] 135 brother Brandon says these
[39:09] virtues all right
[39:14] without see Gifts of those but those
[39:19] gifts of God without these virtues in
[39:22] them make a stumble block to the
[39:25] unbeliever
[39:29] what if GI see we want the gifts without
[39:32] the giver that's the next quote see
[39:34] that's on debate on tongue that we want
[39:36] to have gifts without the
[39:40] giver and that's what Pentecost not
[39:42] throwing off on them that's what they
[39:45] come up with was
[39:48] gifts and that's what gets in the
[39:52] way see a gift will get in your way
[39:55] Brother Don can tell you about a man
[39:57] that at his work he's been healed of
[40:00] different
[40:01] things but now how you going to tell him
[40:03] he's a
[40:06] sinner he's going to tell you all of the
[40:08] healing that happened to him and he's
[40:10] going to look at you and say you ever
[40:11] been
[40:15] healed you going to throw it right in
[40:17] your
[40:18] face cuz that's a
[40:21] gift amen right see gifts are the worst
[40:24] thing in the world to people because how
[40:26] are you going to condemn somebody with a
[40:32] gift come on
[40:34] folks get
[40:36] serious gifts and callings the Bible
[40:38] said is what without repentance outside
[40:42] of repentance you don't repent to get a
[40:44] gift you're born with a gift I was I
[40:48] born with a gift to
[40:50] gab it took 20 years to get that out
[40:54] because in my early life I was the most
[40:56] shameful person you ever seen when you
[40:59] were talking to me I was you you've seen
[41:01] them right you talk to some people
[41:04] there they come look at you a little
[41:06] well because they embarrassed and that's
[41:09] the way I
[41:12] was but then God got a hold of that and
[41:14] he changed it whether you want to call
[41:16] it a Gift of Gab that's all right no
[41:18] problem it works anyway so who's worried
[41:22] about it but see gifts and callings are
[41:23] without repentance you can have all of
[41:25] those gifts and still not be
[41:29] right now here's the one that I quote a
[41:31] lot so to go ahead with number four
[41:33] let's see yeah let's read this
[41:37] one look at number four which is the
[41:39] Harvest Time preached in
[41:43] 1964 watch him now watch this
[41:48] point and read it real
[41:51] careful notice if Satan fails here in
[41:56] other words he's explaining Satan trying
[41:58] to get
[42:00] you okay read it notice if Satan fails
[42:03] here then he'll try his second scheme on
[42:10] you I read it get you to dis believe the
[42:16] word right if he can get you that way
[42:19] just believe the
[42:21] word go to the
[42:23] Seminary if that don't work then watch
[42:25] him
[42:26] he'll try the
[42:28] next a
[42:30] scheme if he can't get you off the word
[42:32] by sending you to school send you to
[42:34] denominational this that and the other
[42:36] he goes to the secondary now watch him
[42:39] what it is he'll try the next to scheme
[42:43] now here is where you want to be real
[42:45] careful and just set for another five
[42:48] minutes on this part if you
[42:51] will then he makes you a supernatural
[42:55] offer
[42:57] now Satan can't get you off the word and
[42:59] you stay with
[43:01] it he'll offer you a supernatural
[43:04] offer now that's what your Prophet is
[43:06] saying
[43:08] now I'm going to come back to all this
[43:11] just before
[43:12] closing if he can't tempt you away from
[43:15] the
[43:18] word no I'm going to stay with the
[43:23] word then he'll give you a supernatural
[43:28] offer and we're talking about
[43:31] Satan right look what he
[43:35] said he said I'll tell you what you
[43:39] remember this is what happened to Jesus
[43:41] fall down jump down the angel to B the
[43:43] up let you hurt you you know and all the
[43:46] remember that was in Satan is in
[43:48] Temptation I'll tell you what you get up
[43:50] here and dive off the temple and bring
[43:53] back up see show the people that you can
[43:55] do something than
[43:59] Supernatural and that was the temptation
[44:01] of the Lord
[44:04] Jesus
[44:06] right boy got them
[44:09] there now watch this this is it watch
[44:13] when you get to the end where this
[44:15] temptation
[44:18] come maybe he might let some of you
[44:22] speak in
[44:23] tongues think you got it that's right
[44:27] right now watch him they going to give
[44:29] you a
[44:31] supernatural
[44:33] offer right or he might even let you
[44:38] prophesy right though it not be with the
[44:41] word see because people don't
[44:44] care look I've seen people stand up and
[44:48] prophesy was as contrary to the word as
[44:51] the East is from the
[44:53] west but now you think you can tell that
[44:55] person
[44:56] there no I forget it see it's a word
[45:00] that you live by look them Supernatural
[45:04] gifts everybody a ha haa Supernatural
[45:08] gifts Satan can just hand them out by
[45:13] the
[45:15] handful
[45:18] Satan he said certainly that don't mean
[45:21] one
[45:24] thing y but brother so and so he got a
[45:27] gift praise
[45:28] God gifts are call into without
[45:31] repentance amen praise the
[45:34] Lord with this brother but he's got a
[45:37] gift to do this out of the other praise
[45:39] God I'm going to relate a story that we
[45:42] were sitting in a certain place one time
[45:44] and this man used his gift as a sister
[45:46] walked
[45:48] by he used his gift and he said so and
[45:50] so right in front of everybody which to
[45:52] me was very out you know uncal for he he
[45:55] could approach her personally but he
[45:57] made a statement the sister came to me
[46:00] and she said brother Dale she
[46:03] said what the brother said he said how
[46:05] come every time I see you he said I
[46:07] think of baby
[46:08] clothes well what does that mean to a
[46:11] unwed girl especially a girl that's own
[46:15] up in
[46:16] age maybe in her
[46:19] 30s you know maybe even old at that time
[46:23] I don't know exactly maybe younger
[46:24] whatever she was
[46:26] she wasn't married we knew the whole
[46:29] story the brother said how come I when I
[46:31] see you I think of baby
[46:33] clothes so the sister came to me later
[46:36] and she said brother
[46:37] Dale she said I want you to know one
[46:39] thing that there ain't no
[46:41] problems you know she's right she's
[46:45] virgin she was
[46:47] right she said the only thing is I work
[46:49] at a baby clothes
[46:54] Factory
[46:56] all
[46:58] right now what am I going to
[47:03] do serious I love the brother still no
[47:07] problems nothing whatsoever didn't
[47:09] condemn and didn't holler at him I just
[47:11] went to him this brother won't talk to
[47:14] you I said remember the other night when
[47:16] you said that every time that girl went
[47:19] across in front of you you saw baby
[47:21] clothes he said
[47:23] yeah I said brother there's no problem
[47:26] problem I said she worked at a baby
[47:28] clothes
[47:31] Factory well I eniz his gift didn't pick
[47:34] up that
[47:36] fact it picked up something he knew
[47:38] something in relation but he didn't have
[47:40] wisdom with his gift irregardless of
[47:43] anything
[47:46] else you said you mean you would be
[47:48] willing to talk to somebody that's your
[47:52] Elder that was in the message and under
[47:54] brother around his ministry at that You'
[47:56] talk to him to tell him that he wasn't
[47:58] right I don't see why you
[48:01] wouldn't are we going to a
[48:04] seniority you know well brother so and
[48:06] so you can't say nothing to him because
[48:08] he was ordained by the prophet if he's
[48:10] wrong he's wrong that's
[48:11] right what's the difference come
[48:15] on you see but we don't want it that
[48:18] way brother BR said he'd be glad when
[48:20] the bride would stand up and say you're
[48:22] not teaching it like like Paul said it
[48:27] well isn't it something in this day we
[48:28] ought to be able to stand up and say
[48:30] you're not saying what brother brandom
[48:33] said I don't care who is who the person
[48:36] is wrong is
[48:40] wrong but see what is God doing Satan
[48:43] can pass out Supernatural
[48:45] gifts you said I don't understand that
[48:48] forget it I don't either but the prophet
[48:50] said it and I believe it right amen cuz
[48:52] remember he was the anointed sherff that
[48:54] Stood Beside the Lord that's one thing
[48:56] you always remember he was those sign he
[48:58] knew all about all of
[49:00] this he was greater than in that extent
[49:03] than any anybody there other than
[49:05] Michael Michael was the only one that
[49:07] could control him and threw him out of
[49:09] Heaven see all right and see Michael was
[49:13] Christ all
[49:14] right but you see now I'm off of trying
[49:16] to help the visitors now down to us so
[49:20] listen Satan can pass out Supernatural
[49:22] gifts but we think well we've got this
[49:24] and we got that we do this we do that
[49:27] the gifts without the
[49:32] virtues or a stumble block that's why he
[49:34] said it we always quote it stumbling
[49:36] block but it says stumble block there
[49:39] okay just in case somebody don't take
[49:41] one but he didn't say that the way the
[49:42] prophet said okay I'll say it the way
[49:44] the prophet said it stumble block what
[49:46] is a stumble block stumbling
[49:50] block but listen what about would God
[49:53] allow these things to happen
[49:57] sir now remember you have come up
[50:00] through virtue knowledge to know that
[50:04] God's word cannot be
[50:07] contradictory you know he can't say
[50:09] something here and something over here
[50:11] and then that would bring Temperance
[50:14] self-control upon
[50:16] us and it would bring us to
[50:20] patience to we WR around and said
[50:22] patience with
[50:24] God
[50:28] not just patience with one another he
[50:29] said patience with God he said when God
[50:32] tells you so and so he said you wait
[50:35] that's
[50:37] right
[50:38] patience with God you mean God would
[50:41] allow Satan to be able to deceive the
[50:44] people through
[50:49] gifts well I just can't see a god like
[50:51] that boy you you just don't see God like
[50:53] I see him I know that
[50:56] cuz when you talk about being God you
[50:58] talk about a lovey doy granddaddy old
[51:02] guy that won't condemn us for being
[51:04] wrong and problems with it he loves us
[51:07] so much yeah but we're the Bride of
[51:09] Jesus
[51:11] Christ you remember the other week when
[51:12] I gave out those quotes where the
[51:14] Prophet said two times in our thus
[51:16] sayith the Lord there'd be a persecution
[51:18] we know the bride doesn't go through
[51:19] tribulation come on get that out but he
[51:21] said there'd be a
[51:24] persecution all right
[51:25] now you said but no I'm not looking
[51:27] forward to it I just know he said
[51:30] it he said Keep Your Homes belong to the
[51:33] Catholic church I didn't make them
[51:37] things well I don't don't brother I just
[51:39] don't think that God let his bride go
[51:41] through that you'd sure would be in bad
[51:44] shape in the Dark Ages wouldn't you when
[51:47] he allowed women to stand and them rip
[51:49] the baby out of their stomach and throw
[51:51] it to the
[51:54] Hogs you should sure wouldn't fit there
[51:56] too good you better thank God you're
[51:58] here
[52:02] now come
[52:05] on brother Rand on the message God of
[52:08] this evil
[52:09] age this evil age is to prove to
[52:13] Satan she is not like Eve that she is
[52:18] not that type of a woman she will be
[52:21] Tried by his word the Bride As Adam's
[52:24] bride was was Tried by the word and
[52:27] Adam's bride believed every bit of the
[52:29] word all but confused on one promise
[52:33] that he's the same yesterday today and
[52:37] forever
[52:39] see but look that's number six drop back
[52:42] to five we've heard this scripture but
[52:45] do you read it like that Deuteronomy
[52:48] 13 if there arise now we we we quote the
[52:51] scripture that if a prophet comes and
[52:53] give you a sign you're supposed to
[52:54] believe the prophet Propet right that's
[52:56] a scripture I forgot what that one is
[52:58] but that is a scripture that's what God
[53:00] said about it we to believe that Prophet
[53:02] because he gave the signs and the things
[53:04] thank God but now look at this if there
[53:07] arise among you a prophet or a dreamer
[53:10] of dreams and giveth thee a sign or a
[53:13] Wonder now watch him and the sign or
[53:16] wonder come to
[53:20] pass other words he says here I got 10
[53:23] people laying in caskets and when I
[53:26] speak it they're going to raise from the
[53:28] dead what are you going to
[53:31] do oh that has to be of
[53:34] God read the rest of the scripture and
[53:37] the sign and wonder come to pass whereof
[53:40] he spake unto thee saying let us go
[53:43] after other
[53:45] gods which thou has not known and let us
[53:48] serve them what is other
[53:53] gods trinities are right yeah come on we
[53:56] got trinities we T but what about the
[53:58] people of this message brother R said
[54:00] this and brother said this and we
[54:01] believe this and we believe that and he
[54:02] said other
[54:04] gods they made brother brandom God
[54:10] right look what it
[54:12] says Thou shalt not hearken unto the
[54:15] words of that Prophet now this is what I
[54:18] love cuz look what God will do are that
[54:21] dreamer of dreams for the Lord your God
[54:25] proveth
[54:26] you to know whether you love the Lord
[54:30] your God with all your heart and with
[54:33] all your soul now that's Bible he's
[54:36] going to allow things to happen that's
[54:38] right 40 something years ago I said you
[54:40] think this is coming but I said one of
[54:42] these days called brother R may I quote
[54:44] him he said it'll come to a date the
[54:46] Methodist and Baptist and all them are
[54:48] Healing The
[54:50] Sick a direct quote come on they're
[54:53] Healing The Sick what are you going to
[54:54] do
[54:57] you go right over
[55:00] there and today you'll probably be some
[55:03] miracle happen in that church right
[55:04] across
[55:06] there well I guess we don't have nothing
[55:08] cuz we ain't got what they
[55:10] got what going on over
[55:13] there that's no
[55:15] problem that's no trouble go worry what
[55:18] do you think I'm not trying to run
[55:20] nobody I I'm just telling the truth
[55:22] that's right but see if he takes you to
[55:25] another God another denomination another
[55:28] idea or
[55:30] opinion and it says that God allowed
[55:34] these to come among you to prove
[55:37] you have you ever noticed this
[55:39] quote now we know God is all knowing god
[55:42] right he knows everything before the
[55:43] world ever begin all that but why would
[55:44] brother R make this statement he said he
[55:47] tried Moses watch him he said because he
[55:51] didn't want to get down to the Red Sea
[55:54] and find out he had the wrong
[55:56] man that's a paraphrase but it's very
[55:59] very
[56:01] close you mean God didn't know Moses
[56:03] would
[56:04] do why did he try Moses to let Moses
[56:07] find out who he
[56:09] was why is he trying us not to prove
[56:12] brother Brandon was
[56:15] right but to see whether we'll take it
[56:17] or
[56:19] not well that brother remember he gave
[56:22] you two things if you won't fall off the
[56:25] word you remember the quote back up
[56:26] above if you won't go off the word
[56:28] what'll he do he'll send you a
[56:30] supernatural
[56:31] offer well brother
[56:35] Dale brother called me one time he had
[56:38] back Sid he was a
[56:41] preacher and he called me he said
[56:42] brother Dale I don't understand it he
[56:45] said I know I'm
[56:47] backslid that's what he said he said I
[56:49] know I'm backlit I'm not living right he
[56:52] said I get sermons just like I did when
[56:55] I was serving the
[56:58] lord he said why would that work like
[57:00] that I said because the Bible says gifts
[57:04] and callings are without
[57:09] repentance I said then he'll give you
[57:11] the gift is I the gift will
[57:18] work you so you mean God would beat that
[57:22] away now what are you bringing all this
[57:24] out of it brother Dale I'm bringing it
[57:26] out for the basis of one
[57:28] thing brother Brown said we come all the
[57:30] way up to
[57:33] Godliness before we got to be like God
[57:36] that's right come all the way up to
[57:38] Godliness before he expects us to be
[57:40] perfect that's what your Prophet said
[57:42] now it's in the Statue of perfect man so
[57:45] now when we come to brotherly kindness
[57:46] in a minute think about it he's let us
[57:48] come all this way before he requires
[57:50] brotherly
[57:53] kindness
[57:55] now come on get the point what does he
[57:56] say the prophet said he come out of this
[57:58] way before he requires that we be
[58:01] perfect what is he talking about your
[58:03] Prophet always taught that the new birth
[58:06] makes you just as perfect as God is
[58:12] amen eternal life in your soul makes you
[58:15] just as perfect why because it is
[58:19] God that's right but now he requires us
[58:23] to come to perfection you remember what
[58:25] we brought out to in definitions of the
[58:27] word Perfection What Be You therefore
[58:29] perfect even as your father in Heaven
[58:30] perfect means complete in a full
[58:33] age that's right just the same as Paul
[58:37] saying in Hebrews 6 And1 he just got two
[58:40] and five declaring that babies need milk
[58:43] but those that are are of to eat meat
[58:45] are of those of strong because they've
[58:48] exercised their their faith they're
[58:49] doing then he declares it in chapter 61
[58:53] and
[58:53] says
[58:55] therefore leaving the principles of the
[58:57] doctrine of Christ let us go on to
[58:59] Perfection not laying again the
[59:01] foundations of dead works and of Eternal
[59:03] judgment was Paul saying we're going to
[59:05] leave all of these
[59:07] things
[59:09] no come on what kind of a carnal mind
[59:11] have you got that's right he was saying
[59:13] put these place things in order that's
[59:15] right get it settled that there's
[59:19] no judgment for the bride amen but get
[59:23] it settled that they can be a judgment
[59:25] to the world and that judgment is
[59:27] eternal because God made the judgment
[59:29] and you can't change the Judgment once
[59:31] it's made so then it's right Eternal
[59:33] judgments and baptisms
[59:36] and why don't we read the
[59:39] Bible that's
[59:41] it so you come all the way up statue of
[59:44] perfect man you come all the way up to
[59:47] Godliness then you're required to be
[59:48] perfect Paul is explaining the same
[59:50] thing therefore leaving the principles
[59:52] of doctr of let us go on to perfection
[59:59] what Perfection perfect means of full
[1:00:03] grown or age why is it as we were
[1:00:07] talking about last night why is it in
[1:00:09] Hebrews 1140 they without us cannot be
[1:00:12] made
[1:00:13] what
[1:00:16] perfect what does that
[1:00:18] mean are we going to get them up and
[1:00:20] preach something to them no we're going
[1:00:24] to bring them to a full
[1:00:27] age cuz in the resurrection and Rapture
[1:00:30] they're going to be to a full age not at
[1:00:33] everybody we talking about last night
[1:00:34] everybody won't be the same no because
[1:00:35] it's meant to be that way but you'll
[1:00:38] bring them to a completion why because
[1:00:41] the holy ghost that started in them by
[1:00:42] New Birth brings you to a completion
[1:00:45] through the bride in the end time all
[1:00:48] right so then and what is it in
[1:00:51] brotherly
[1:00:53] kindness
[1:00:56] the prophet said on what let's see the
[1:00:59] statue of perfect man 3:41 he said these
[1:01:01] Fellers are not required what these
[1:01:03] Fells required these Fells are not
[1:01:05] required what these Fells are
[1:01:09] required why cuz Luther met his and took
[1:01:12] it and stopped on that of that y shall
[1:01:14] live by
[1:01:15] faith he's not required to come to a
[1:01:17] change of the body but you and I
[1:01:22] are that's why there waiting on you and
[1:01:25] I
[1:01:27] Amen brother R said God's waiting on you
[1:01:30] and
[1:01:32] I so let's don't blame god well God just
[1:01:35] ain't never give that to me have you
[1:01:36] made yourself
[1:01:40] available I ain't going out there I
[1:01:41] might get confused don't worry about
[1:01:43] honey you already
[1:01:45] are yeah but if I went out there and
[1:01:47] listen to Brother D I might get confused
[1:01:49] honey you already are
[1:01:53] confused where would the truth confuse
[1:01:56] anybody that's
[1:01:58] right yeah would he is so deep to he's
[1:02:01] this that or the
[1:02:04] other I wish you could understand what
[1:02:06] being deep is okay you know that being
[1:02:09] deep is the shallowest thing that's ever
[1:02:11] been in the
[1:02:14] world that's my definition of deep
[1:02:17] brother brand was very deep you know
[1:02:20] what he was the most shallow man that
[1:02:22] I've ever seen as he could explain the
[1:02:25] Bible right not that he was shallow in
[1:02:28] that he didn't have anything no but he
[1:02:30] took all he had and brought it to a
[1:02:32] place to where he could talk our
[1:02:34] language is that not what the scripture
[1:02:36] says about Jesus that the Common People
[1:02:39] heard him gladly
[1:02:42] why not because he could explain the vs
[1:02:45] the plagues the Thunders the this that
[1:02:47] or the other but because he could bring
[1:02:48] the gospel down to a simple language
[1:02:50] that it could be
[1:02:53] comprehended
[1:02:55] what are we supposed to
[1:02:59] be go ahead to number nine we'll pick
[1:03:01] this
[1:03:07] up and look what he says CU we're going
[1:03:10] to come down to brotherly
[1:03:12] kindness you better remember one thing
[1:03:15] too because like I told you there was a
[1:03:16] brother came through one time brother Mo
[1:03:18] was preaching on the Statue of perfect
[1:03:19] man and he he was telling the brother
[1:03:21] and the brother said don't tell me let
[1:03:23] me figure it all out and I'll come back
[1:03:25] and preach it 6 months later he came
[1:03:27] back ain't joking you know 6 months
[1:03:29] later he came back and he
[1:03:33] preached because of a quote that he had
[1:03:36] brother brandham says the brotherly
[1:03:39] kindness age is takes the
[1:03:44] Rapture now this is a Ministry I'm
[1:03:47] thought not throwing off on God help me
[1:03:48] I'm just telling it like it is to make
[1:03:50] it sensible to you you know what he
[1:03:52] preached what do does the word
[1:03:54] Philadelphia
[1:03:58] mean what does the word Philadelphia
[1:04:00] mean brotherly love right the City of
[1:04:04] Brotherly Love is Philadelphia what it
[1:04:07] Pennsylvania is that what what state is
[1:04:09] it in brotherly
[1:04:11] love and so he preached that if if
[1:04:14] Brotherly Love was where he at then rash
[1:04:16] are going to take place in sixth Church
[1:04:22] AG they spent six months studying
[1:04:26] that I happen to remember that a brother
[1:04:29] two sent three days studying on Daniel
[1:04:31] 70 weeks and made his own
[1:04:37] drawing he wasn't the other guy that
[1:04:39] made it but he followed right with him
[1:04:42] yeah why you want make another one
[1:04:44] brother randam already Dr it that's
[1:04:46] right but listen what is he
[1:04:49] saying brotherly
[1:04:51] kindness now that's a good one
[1:04:54] right there the
[1:04:58] sixth seventh see all right adding
[1:05:01] brotherly kindness all right when you
[1:05:04] get to that brotherly kindness put
[1:05:06] yourself in his place on the matter now

[1:06:05] Brown until you walked in your shoes and
[1:06:08] that just stuck with me you know you
[1:06:10] realize that I'm talking to people out
[1:06:13] on internet probably that have never
[1:06:18] heard that you need these virtues
[1:06:20] because their pastors never taught them
[1:06:22] that well what can they understand about
[1:06:24] what we're talking
[1:06:27] about but just remember they've never
[1:06:30] heard
[1:06:31] it oh that gets me good I I'm I'm sorry
[1:06:35] I'm human I'm
[1:06:37] sorry but how many times have I ever
[1:06:40] said it this
[1:06:42] way takes you six months for me to pound
[1:06:46] into to you that you need to get
[1:06:49] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:06:52] Christ but the first person you see out
[1:06:54] on the
[1:06:55] street your church wrong you ever been
[1:06:58] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:06:59] Christ you don't you going to die and go
[1:07:00] to
[1:07:01] hell and you come back and you say well
[1:07:03] brother you shouldn't have been that
[1:07:05] well I got it to start with when I first
[1:07:08] started I got it I said 6 months it took
[1:07:12] me to get you in the
[1:07:16] water but see that's the why we think
[1:07:18] isin
[1:07:19] it so is it with brotherly
[1:07:21] kindness see well I've got brotherly
[1:07:25] kindness have you got what the prophet
[1:07:27] calls it when you get that brotherly
[1:07:29] kindness you put yourself in his
[1:07:32] place I don't see why y'all can't
[1:07:35] believe that I I believed it a long
[1:07:39] time put yourself in his
[1:07:42] place come on we're going to read right
[1:07:45] hope we get
[1:07:46] it my brother sinned against
[1:07:51] me said Peter shall I forgive give him
[1:07:55] he said seven times a day that's
[1:07:57] wonderful ain't he's quoting scripture
[1:07:59] back to the Lord Jesus what Jesus say
[1:08:01] Jesus said 70 * 7 that's 490 that's why
[1:08:05] you're Daniel 70 weeks has the 490 heers
[1:08:07] to it that's why all of that is in there
[1:08:10] cuz Jesus said for 70 * 7 that's 490 now
[1:08:14] he also adds right in there if you know
[1:08:16] he said it again if you ask you that's
[1:08:19] the best way brother Rand had defining
[1:08:21] it 70 * 7 is 490 again if you ask
[1:08:25] it well I'm up to it now one more
[1:08:29] time one more time and no he said again
[1:08:32] if you ask

[1:11:02] message go I go to them and I hugged her
[1:11:05] neck and I said brother I love
[1:11:07] you like I was telling them last night a
[1:11:10] certain brother in this message I won't
[1:11:12] call his name or the church either but
[1:11:14] he was wrong and I went to him and told
[1:11:17] him he was
[1:11:20] wrong and he got offended with me
[1:11:24] and I went back and I said brother I'm
[1:11:29] sorry I believe what I told you is the
[1:11:31] truth but I'm sorry that I hurt your
[1:11:35] feelings over this
[1:11:39] matter he got up in front of a
[1:11:41] congregation one day and he said to
[1:11:43] thank a man that would tell me I was
[1:11:45] wrong and show me I was wrong but said
[1:11:47] yet he would
[1:11:49] apologize for talking to
[1:11:52] me
[1:11:55] I didn't have no problem with
[1:11:57] that I don't have no problem with saying
[1:11:59] I'm
[1:12:00] sorry I ain't saying I'm sorry if I'm
[1:12:05] right remember may I quote brother per
[1:12:09] green as a quote okay cuz he said
[1:12:12] brother brandham said it I believe it he
[1:12:14] said he was talking to brother brandham
[1:12:15] one day and he said brother brandham
[1:12:17] told him said brother Perry he said from
[1:12:19] where you
[1:12:21] stand he said to where I
[1:12:24] stand he said everything you do is
[1:12:28] sin now some of you may have heard him
[1:12:31] because I'm 99% sure he said in
[1:12:34] Atlanta but he said brother brandham
[1:12:36] said but from where I stand to where God
[1:12:39] is everything I do is
[1:12:43] sin I believe that whether it ever
[1:12:46] happened or not I believe
[1:12:48] it not because so and so said so and so
[1:12:51] no because it's truth
[1:12:54] just remember when you're looking down
[1:12:56] on somebody there's always somebody

[1:13:29] asked him was there any possibility for
[1:13:32] me to go get a flight home and they said

[1:17:23] until those virtues no matter what they
[1:17:27] say to you no matter what
[1:17:30] listen all right what is he going on
[1:17:35] to I don't have time to let me preach
[1:17:38] just a little bit okay and and you know
[1:17:40] it's there cuz I'll do the best I can
[1:17:42] quoting so they can pull this up and let
[1:17:44] you do
[1:17:45] it uh brother brandham in speaking on a
[1:17:48] message right after the statue of
[1:17:50] perfect man which is two or three days
[1:17:52] later he preaches a message called
[1:17:54] Blasphemous names and in that message he
[1:17:57] begins with telling a dream that a
[1:17:59] sister had and that she was worried
[1:18:02] whether she had the holy ghost or not
[1:18:04] and as she was concerned about those
[1:18:06] things she laid down on a new folder of
[1:18:08] thing she had a dream she goes to
[1:18:10] brother brandham tells him the dream you
[1:18:13] know writes a letter I think to him and
[1:18:15] then he refers back to it when he gets
[1:18:17] to this message you know and refers back
[1:18:20] to her and the dream you know now he
[1:18:22] says in he said I don't have the paper
[1:18:24] she wrote it
[1:18:25] on I'm I'm a little bit beyond that and
[1:18:28] I hope you are God brother around says
[1:18:30] when you tell a prophet a dream he says
[1:18:32] he sees the dream he'll
[1:18:35] say you'll say so and so and so he say
[1:18:38] why did you leave this out he said he
[1:18:41] sees the Dream well he's telling the
[1:18:44] sister about the dream and she saw this
[1:18:47] place upon a mountain or like upon a
[1:18:49] thing and she sees a rock Box sitting in
[1:18:52] in the top of the mountain and this is
[1:18:55] not Junior Jackson's dream we'll get to
[1:18:57] that one later all right if we have time
[1:19:00] all right and he's covering this that
[1:19:03] it's a rock Box sitting in the top of
[1:19:05] the mountain he covers that every Church
[1:19:07] age has a rock box that dream was a he
[1:19:11] said it is a spiritual dream he said it
[1:19:14] identically goes with the message he
[1:19:17] preached of the stature of a perfect man
[1:19:19] all right so then they go together to
[1:19:21] make the same point so read them
[1:19:23] together all right so in that mean he
[1:19:26] got to it and he says that when he saw
[1:19:29] that he said this man was standing there
[1:19:31] and said he had this thing and he would
[1:19:33] holding water and he poured over in to
[1:19:36] this rock box and he said it was boiling
[1:19:39] out all of the trash and it was running
[1:19:42] out he says that water was the Holy
[1:19:48] Spirit and he goes on to say that that
[1:19:51] was the Holy Spirit and nothing will
[1:19:54] hold
[1:19:56] it he said nothing will hold the Holy
[1:19:58] Spirit he said you don't put it in
[1:20:00] churches you put it in individuals right
[1:20:03] he said c it'll run out all right he
[1:20:06] says then he the man went and got she
[1:20:09] was concerned about because it was
[1:20:10] boiling over the man went and got some
[1:20:13] honey and poured it into the Rock
[1:20:17] box and he said that honey represents
[1:20:20] brotherly kindness
[1:20:24] see now so none of these others would
[1:20:25] hold
[1:20:26] on even though you come up to Great
[1:20:30] godliness they won't hold on to that
[1:20:34] point but when it come to that little
[1:20:36] rock
[1:20:37] box he said that honey represented the
[1:20:41] holy represented brotherly kindness and
[1:20:44] he said it held said it looked like it
[1:20:47] wasn't but said it held together he said
[1:20:51] that's brotherly kindness the age that
[1:20:52] you're living in all right see then
[1:20:55] because it's a restoration now listen so
[1:20:58] therefore the rock the latterday
[1:21:01] Pentecostal Church which has received
[1:21:04] this is paragraph 121 of Blasphemous
[1:21:06] night received the Holy Spirit they did
[1:21:09] at the first all down Through the Ages
[1:21:12] they received the Holy Spirit but not in
[1:21:15] the measure that they have it now
[1:21:17] because it's a restoration of the first
[1:21:20] all right see so it's been the Holy
[1:21:22] Ghost and every age and that Holy Ghost
[1:21:25] it is the word he said it was the
[1:21:28] messenger now I'm jumping a whole lot
[1:21:31] but the messenger to the church
[1:21:34] paragraph 123 24 of blasphemia names the
[1:21:38] messenger to the church pouring the
[1:21:41] message into the church okay what was
[1:21:45] the water that was being poured into
[1:21:46] that the
[1:21:47] message this message is to boil out all
[1:21:50] of our unbelief
[1:21:53] right he said I just got to telling you
[1:21:56] of Brotherly kindness the age we live in
[1:22:00] now all right see then when it does he
[1:22:04] poured
[1:22:05] out onto that
[1:22:08] church and his brotherly kindness to
[1:22:11] Honey now we pick up this evening a
[1:22:14] little more on the TI together with
[1:22:16] brother Jackson's dream that he has that
[1:22:19] brother random verifies because listen I
[1:22:21] ain't just quoting to you you can do
[1:22:23] what you want to let's see he
[1:22:29] says paragraph 114 of Blasphemous 9 now
[1:22:33] here is the
[1:22:35] interpretation of her
[1:22:38] dream a rock
[1:22:41] Box water was boiling out the message
[1:22:44] boiling out all the trash then you add
[1:22:47] brotherly kindness Brotherly
[1:22:50] Love said it looked like it was going to
[1:22:52] SW swell and bust but said it didn't
[1:22:54] said it
[1:22:56] held we see that's a very important
[1:22:58] thing for the hour to think about that
[1:23:00] the brotherly kindness of this messenger
[1:23:03] pouring the message in will bring that
[1:23:05] brotherly kindness into
[1:23:08] being to where it'll
[1:23:10] hold you got a lot more you go through
[1:23:12] blasphemist names you go through it what
[1:23:14] he's talking about the Rock Box
[1:23:17] confession the Holy Ghost he said can be
[1:23:19] preached in these places but
[1:23:23] that's good or bad he said because you
[1:23:25] got Renegades you got everything
[1:23:27] therefore the rock this latterday
[1:23:29] Pentecostal
[1:23:33] Church the Bride of Jesus Christ there's
[1:23:37] a brotherly kindness that's expected in
[1:23:39] you and I he said why would you go
[1:23:41] brother
[1:23:44] brandom he realized that he would go a
[1:23:46] lot of times and preach when he knew the
[1:23:49] people there only had him for the signs
[1:23:53] and the
[1:23:54] Wonders they only had him for showing
[1:23:56] the
[1:23:58] gifts they didn't believe what he said
[1:24:01] what about the 300 ministers that he
[1:24:03] went and talked to about baptism in the
[1:24:05] name of the Lord Jesus
[1:24:07] Christ he said they all wanted tapes he
[1:24:10] said we never seen a one none of them
[1:24:13] ever got tapes and things but did
[1:24:15] brother Brandon quit going
[1:24:19] no he
[1:24:20] went what' you call him
[1:24:22] brotherly
[1:24:24] kindness the brotherly kindness would
[1:24:27] come to a
[1:24:29] position that God would require this
[1:24:32] brotherly kindness before he would cap
[1:24:33] off the whole
[1:24:36] thing that brotherly kindness would be
[1:24:38] the honey that would be there sure
