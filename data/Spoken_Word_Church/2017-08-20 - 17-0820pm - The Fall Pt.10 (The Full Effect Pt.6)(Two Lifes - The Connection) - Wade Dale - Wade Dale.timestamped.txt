[0:00] y'all wanna sit down for a minute please
[0:01] if you don't mind I try to make it as
[0:03] quick as I can but it's come to our
[0:06] attention that there's a couple people
[0:07] that Gavin I know that are struggling
[0:09] with depression and it's a spirit that
[0:12] she and I both dealt with when we were
[0:13] teenagers back before we met before we
[0:16] knew one another and so I want to
[0:18] testify to help those folks and let
[0:21] y'all know that we're standing here with
[0:22] you and fighting the battle but it's
[0:24] ultimately your demon to overcome if
[0:27] you're struggling with depression and
[0:29] it's not just for those that we know of
[0:31] it's also for these teenagers because I
[0:33] know that teenagers are very susceptible
[0:34] to that spirit and if you haven't faced
[0:37] it already you likely will someday lust
[0:38] and depression those things the devil
[0:41] tends to attack especially young people
[0:42] with so let me tell you how overcame I
[0:45] testified at the Alabama camp a 2006
[0:47] don't know if I ever testified here but
[0:50] at any rate I went through it during the
[0:52] age from 17 to 21 and especially in the
[0:56] latter part of that the last few months
[0:57] was a very tough I thought about suicide
[0:59] often and it didn't even seem like
[1:01] suicide would do justice to and I was
[1:03] like job I curse the day that I was even
[1:05] conceived I wish I'd never been born
[1:06] that's how bad off I was but there's
[1:09] different reasons that people go through
[1:12] depression lots of different I call them
[1:14] triggers and for Gabby it was because
[1:17] she was an orphan girl from age 8 to age
[1:20] 16 she was sort of what you call
[1:22] downtrodden outcast every home that took
[1:25] her in as a foster kid they eventually
[1:27] kicked her out and she always just
[1:28] wanted a family that's what she begged
[1:30] called for she cried she she wasn't a
[1:32] Christian but she believed in God and
[1:34] she asked God for a family and
[1:36] ultimately age 15 she saw she probably
[1:39] going to get adopted so she started
[1:40] trying to kill herself and she was very
[1:42] very upset very depressed
[1:45] well the Lord heard of prayer and gave
[1:48] her a family and they adopted her
[1:49] message believed in family so they
[1:51] introduced her to the message she came
[1:53] to know Christ she gave her heart to the
[1:54] Lord and believed the message and it all
[1:57] took away the depression and now she has
[1:58] family and Kentucky family here also
[2:00] Church family here in church family
[2:02] Kentucky so I gave her the desirable
[2:03] heart it's got family all around and no
[2:06] depression she's been free from
[2:07] depression for years and so if I so
[2:10] we're a testimony that you can live
[2:11] without depression okay
[2:13] you won't have it the rest of your life
[2:14] if you'll just fight it part of the
[2:16] reason that you succumb to that spirit
[2:18] is because you don't resist it okay if
[2:20] you embrace that spirit lust or
[2:22] depression anything the devil tempts you
[2:24] with when you embrace it in other words
[2:26] you dwell on the thought it will you
[2:29] know you will succumb to that spirit you
[2:31] resist the devil not once but constantly
[2:34] you never stop resisting the devil okay
[2:37] it's not just a one-time thing then it's
[2:38] over with it's an overcoming just like
[2:40] Christianity itself is not a one-time
[2:42] decision this is a whole life long
[2:43] everyday you decided I'm going to do
[2:45] right every single day I'm going to
[2:47] resist the devil and I'll show you how I
[2:49] did that
[2:50] what depression is if you don't know
[2:52] it's an oppressive spirit this is an own
[2:53] definition for my experience an
[2:55] impressive spirit that causes one to
[2:56] lose your drive or your motivation your
[2:58] desire you don't want to get up in the
[3:00] morning you don't want to go to bed at
[3:01] night but I'm going to go to work you
[3:02] don't wanna go to church you don't want
[3:03] to go to school you don't wanna do
[3:04] anything nothing makes sense there's
[3:06] just no purpose and you don't feel
[3:07] useful to anybody that was to me what
[3:10] depression was here's some of the lies
[3:12] the devil told me he said Ron you're not
[3:15] a Christian you must not be because
[3:16] you're struggling with the pressure I
[3:17] count brother branham as a Christian
[3:19] brother branham wanted to kill himself
[3:21] he tried a couple times and I believe I
[3:24] read a message the other day where he
[3:25] had an oppressive spirit come on him
[3:27] every 7 years in his life I don't know
[3:29] if y'all remember that some nervousness
[3:31] or something whatever it was if you're
[3:33] struggling with depression it don't mean
[3:35] you're abnormal it don't mean that
[3:36] there's something wrong with you it
[3:38] doesn't mean you're not a Christian you
[3:39] just keep pressing the battle and don't
[3:41] stop never stop but they'll always tells
[3:44] us you know don't don't give up don't
[3:46] don't sit down don't stop don't what you
[3:48] call plateau you just keep going I mean
[3:51] what do you think you're born again or
[3:52] not you just keep pressing the battle
[3:53] okay I never stopped that's been my
[3:55] theme for 20 years as a Christian is
[3:57] never stop and also Jesus was tempted to
[4:01] cast himself down devil took him up to a
[4:03] pinnacle of a high place told him cast
[4:04] yourself down so order sounds like
[4:06] suicide but anyway God himself and flesh
[4:09] was being tempted you know when he faced
[4:11] things that we would face - and then the
[4:15] only difference between a Christian a
[4:18] depressed Christian and a depressed
[4:20] Center is that the Christian has hope
[4:22] and as a sinner if a sinner struggle
[4:25] with depression I say get Jesus that
[4:26] beast
[4:27] everyone you know good case of salvation
[4:28] but the Christian has hope and your hope
[4:31] is the Word of God Jesus overcame by the
[4:33] Word of God and so do we
[4:35] every temptation he faced he found a
[4:37] scripture that was in opposition to that
[4:39] spirit and he withheld that was
[4:42] resisting the devil okay and I'll show
[4:44] you scriptures y'all go and put the
[4:45] scriptures up there please you may not
[4:48] have a lot of word reveal to you but
[4:49] your hope is the Word of God you find
[4:51] some promise in the Bible and hold on to
[4:53] that and you don't you can't do that if
[4:55] you don't read the Bible every day
[4:56] read the Bible and pray every single day
[4:58] never forsake the assembling ourselves
[5:00] together being fellowship read listen to
[5:02] sermons read sermons and you don't feel
[5:04] like doing that if you're depressed but
[5:06] I set and read through my crocodile
[5:08] tears having a lousy lousy whew woe is
[5:10] me time I sit there with tears streaming
[5:13] down my face read my Bible and pray and
[5:15] Satan saying why are you doing that I'd
[5:17] say well I don't know but I'm going to
[5:18] keep doing it anyway I'm not stopping I
[5:20] faced a lust Eamon I'm not going to know
[5:22] the details of that but you know during
[5:24] the time I was facing a lust Eamon I'd
[5:27] turn around read my Bible and pray and
[5:28] you say we're on your hypocrite might
[5:29] have been but I didn't stop you no you
[5:32] just don't ever stop here's a couple of
[5:35] scriptures this one I came across the
[5:36] other day this is not one that I use
[5:37] that I think it would be useful proverbs
[5:39] 10:22 the hope of the righteous shall be
[5:41] gladness that's your hope gladness not
[5:44] depression be glad next scripture please
[5:47] this is one of the ones that I use fun
[5:51] you can find many times in the Bible
[5:52] where it says rejoice this today was
[5:54] water made let's rejoice and be glad in
[5:55] it next one right rejoice evermore next
[5:59] okay Philippians 4:8 this is not what I
[6:02] count be my new birth scripture but it's
[6:04] finally breathing you've heard the
[6:06] scripture what certain things are true
[6:07] and you read through all those things to
[6:08] think on these things okay next one this
[6:12] is what so the bowel tells us what to
[6:13] think about likewise it says what not to
[6:15] think about casting down imaginations
[6:16] every high thing that is all self
[6:18] against now for God in captivity every
[6:20] thought to there be a surprise
[6:21] depression is not in obedience to Christ
[6:24] those thoughts you cast down you think
[6:26] on these things and then I'm thunder
[6:30] just be as quick as I can perseverance
[6:31] y'all remember brother Branham preached
[6:33] about perseverance listen that sermon
[6:35] read it look up the word tenacity
[6:37] I just recently look that word up
[6:39] to take a hold of something and grab it
[6:42] and hold it with all your might and
[6:43] never let go
[6:44] tenacity okay perseverance those two go
[6:47] hand in hand that's what a Christian has
[6:49] to be to overcome a Christian soldier
[6:50] okay if you don't reason why you do or
[6:53] die every day you read the Word of God
[6:55] and pray or if you feel like it or not
[6:56] and then of course just good
[6:57] old-fashioned patience you wait on God
[6:59] because this took years I went through
[7:01] this spirit for years okay and kept
[7:04] reading my Bible and praying every day
[7:05] and crying and wanting to die alright
[7:09] scroll down I think there might be one
[7:10] more scripture I don't recall I guess
[7:12] that's it so my deliverance came after
[7:14] years of the struggling my deliverance
[7:16] station became one day in 2006 I was
[7:18] praying and just really fed up sick and
[7:21] tired of being sick and tired I went as
[7:23] I often did just through myself before
[7:25] the Lord threw myself on my floor of my
[7:26] bedroom and cried to God he finally
[7:28] spoke to me and he said you speak so I
[7:32] got up and I turned my prayer to the
[7:34] devil and I said Satan leave and that
[7:37] was when I was lifted from me and it's
[7:38] never been back then and then there was
[7:44] one of the voices that I heard there in
[7:46] that prayer and I can't explain this but
[7:48] it sounded like not one but multiple
[7:50] demons that I could hear within me
[7:51] crying and screaming it's ever been cast
[7:54] down in fear it was very real and I've
[7:56] never been depressed since well here
[7:58] with y'all we're praying with praying
[7:59] with y'all okay man you stand I guess we
[8:09] can just pray now and be dismissed we

[28:35] few days of R&R and then when we get

[28:40] we're doing and all that so just keep

[28:44] Bibles turn to the book of acts 2 verse

[28:52] may finish our thought we've been on the
[28:55] fall part 10 the full effect we've been
[29:00] talking about two lights but now we're
[29:01] going to look at the connection last
[29:03] Sunday we talked about the inheritance
[29:05] and we'll kind of back up a little bit
[29:06] on that inheritance but there's got to
[29:09] be a connection from what God had
[29:11] his mind from what the thoughts that he
[29:13] had there had to be a connection of and
[29:16] we know God's thoughts are real but
[29:18] there had to be something come into this
[29:20] dimension because this is where man fell
[29:22] man didn't man did not fall in heaven
[29:25] man fell on earth now Satan fell in
[29:29] heaven but where he fall down - he fall
[29:32] down to the earth okay so everything
[29:34] kind of happens down here like I've
[29:35] always said there's there's no
[29:37] redemption in heaven
[29:39] you don't need redemption in heaven you
[29:42] need redemption on earth man because
[29:44] remember God never fell nothing eternal
[29:48] ever fell and man nothing how can you
[29:52] have something an eternity in it fall no
[29:54] it can't fall what fell was we'll talk
[29:58] about the carnality we talked about a
[30:00] little bit this morning of man stir but
[30:02] acts 2 verse 1 and we're going to this
[30:04] is where we're going to bring the
[30:05] connection in because we know we were in
[30:07] the thoughts of God we're going to talk
[30:09] about that today we know that we were in
[30:11] the eternal section but there had to be
[30:13] a day that it come to a reality on earth
[30:17] the connection between what God said and
[30:20] what God saw - what now you and I are a
[30:23] witness on this earth and man we're a
[30:25] walking witness of God on the earth but
[30:29] there had to come a time when that had
[30:31] to happen that inheritance had to be
[30:34] fulfilled in the hearts of man all right
[30:38] so let's bow our heads and get started
[30:41] your heavenly Father would pray that
[30:42] you'd bless us today be with us take
[30:46] care of us today and you be Lord the one
[30:48] that does the speaking you be the one
[30:50] that does the hearing father you be the
[30:52] one that takes over this vessel takes
[30:55] over all these vessels in this room
[30:57] father and you be the one that reveals
[30:59] you'd be the one Lord that gives us Lord
[31:02] as many times we we hear the Prophet
[31:05] says if you've got questions then God's
[31:07] got the answer we we know that you're
[31:09] you're not a heavenly father that we ask
[31:11] for bread and you give a stones or we
[31:13] ask for fish and you give us something
[31:16] else Lord we know that you give us the
[31:18] desire of our heart if it's toward you
[31:20] father we pray now that all of our
[31:23] thoughts for the next a little time
[31:24] would
[31:25] upon you and it would be upon you word
[31:28] which you and the word are the same and
[31:30] be with Lord us as we take this time of
[31:36] fellowship that we can take our little
[31:39] licks of fire and bring them together
[31:40] Lord and be a burning light for you
[31:44] forgive us of our sins be with the ones
[31:46] that are sick be the ones that are not
[31:47] with us today we was the ones Lord on
[31:50] this wall right below my feet in a
[31:52] Sunday School class Lord Li times
[31:54] getting short saved those children save
[31:57] those parents save those spouses all the
[32:01] ones Lord that are on that list
[32:02] downstairs father we we run through our
[32:05] mind of the different ones often and we
[32:09] miss them in Lord we desire their
[32:11] fellowship but we desire more than
[32:12] anything is for them to have fellowship
[32:14] with you just Lord we ask you to be with
[32:16] the ones on the foreign fields take care
[32:19] of them give them fruit for their labor
[32:21] bless us and lead us guide us by your
[32:23] Holy Spirit in Jesus name Amen
[32:26] acts 2 verse 1 and when the day of
[32:28] Pentecost was fully come they were all
[32:30] with one Accord in one place and
[32:32] suddenly there came a sound from heaven
[32:34] as of a rushing mighty wind and it
[32:36] filled all the house where they were
[32:37] sitting and there appeared unto them
[32:39] cloven tongues like as a fire and it set
[32:42] upon each of them and they were all
[32:44] filled with the Holy Ghost now remember
[32:47] Jesus breathed on them days was before
[32:49] that before he went to Calvary he
[32:52] breathed on them and said receive ye the
[32:54] Holy Ghost now why didn't they receive
[32:57] it then and why was that whatever that
[32:59] seed was quick and it wasn't time for it
[33:02] and number one thing is Jesus had it in
[33:06] himself but he knew what was coming
[33:10] he knew that he would release that life
[33:13] fifty days later on the day of Pentecost
[33:16] and they were all filled with the Holy
[33:18] Ghost and began to speak with other
[33:19] tongues as the Spirit gave them
[33:21] utterance she may be seated in the Lord
[33:23] at his blessing of the reading of the
[33:24] word Bob if you would grab me up some
[33:28] water Louie for somebody done there now
[33:32] we're going to read in Ephesians brother
[33:33] Dale read part of it today but we we
[33:35] want to now look at
[33:39] action and try to get into this to life
[33:43] part and get through it and get into the
[33:46] connection of us going back to where we
[33:49] came from commands out all right no beer
[33:52] sleepy crowd today because I come and
[33:54] talk to you a man Ephesians 1 verse 4
[33:57] let's read this brother Dale ready this
[33:59] morning according if he have chosen us
[34:00] in him now remember as he said this
[34:03] morning we were not chosen by him we
[34:09] were chosen in him all right before the
[34:12] foundation of the world so one other
[34:14] were the chose that choosing was done
[34:15] was in him all right before the
[34:19] foundation of the world that we should
[34:20] be holy and without blame before him in
[34:22] love what having predestinated us unto
[34:25] the adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[34:28] to himself now remember we told you
[34:30] about last Sunday word and we'll read it
[34:33] again where the prophet of God told us
[34:35] that Jesus didn't come to bring you an
[34:37] inheritance Jesus didn't come down here
[34:41] and develop an inheritance for you to
[34:43] receive a man alright to me that clears
[34:46] up a lot because watch this having three
[34:49] days predestinated us unto the adoption
[34:51] of children by Jesus Christ to himself
[34:53] according to the good pleasure of his
[34:56] will and what is his will his will is
[34:59] his word and then we come to the reading
[35:02] of the will today we have opened up the
[35:04] will book and the will is telling us
[35:06] exactly what our inheritance is not
[35:09] going to be it's what it already is and
[35:14] then to the praise of the glory of His
[35:17] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[35:19] in the beloved hey you like that I like
[35:24] that I like that but I want to go back
[35:27] down to one more go back to number four
[35:28] I missed one right here my notes look
[35:31] right here Courtney act shows enough in
[35:34] him for the foundation in the world that
[35:36] we should be what holy and what without
[35:40] blame oh my goodness thankfully without
[35:44] blame
[35:50] done deal done deal
[35:53] done deal he sees us holy i I got a I
[35:58] got a quote I'm going to hold for maybe
[36:00] another sermon but brother Brian
[36:01] remember God doesn't see your sin if God
[36:04] ever sees one speck of sin he must
[36:08] destroy you he cannot sit and look at
[36:11] sin that's what we're going to talk
[36:13] about today and when you look at when we
[36:16] look at foreknowledge and we look at
[36:17] predestination you have to add sin into
[36:20] that picked up something Wednesday night
[36:26] it will pay attention we might be
[36:28] getting something but we're reading in
[36:33] just a minute all right having
[36:36] predestinated up until the adoption of
[36:37] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[36:39] according to the good pleasure of his
[36:40] will which is this word
[36:43] he loves his word because that's who he
[36:45] is because the praise of the glory of
[36:48] His grace because we don't have any
[36:51] wearing he has made us accepted in the
[36:54] beloved so we've been accepted it's done
[36:56] it's finished finish work in whom we
[36:59] have redemption through his blood the
[37:01] forgiveness of sins now look we have
[37:04] redemption through his blood but that's
[37:06] not our inheritance being developed
[37:09] that's getting us back to our
[37:11] inheritance by the forgiveness of sins
[37:14] according to the riches of His grace
[37:16] everybody got that same an his blood
[37:18] down here on the earth did not bring us
[37:21] an inheritance it cleaned us up to get
[37:26] us back to our inheritance amen that's
[37:29] why everything's got to go through the
[37:31] blood
[37:32] Abraham give his wife away twice lastik
[37:35] God to us a failure but when Paul looks
[37:41] back through the cross and through the
[37:43] blood he says staggered not now look
[37:46] Paul was a liar if he didn't look back
[37:51] through and see something we didn't see
[37:53] come he wrote it in the eternal Word of
[37:55] God he said staggered not at the promise
[37:56] of God but we look over here in the Old
[37:59] Testament and it looks like he stumbled
[38:01] Sagat all over everything but finally
[38:04] abraham being the father of our faith
[38:06] said God I can't do it right I'm going
[38:11] to have to believe in what you said and
[38:13] God said that's what I would have
[38:14] thought that's what I wanted you to save
[38:16] when this journey started you know same
[38:19] thing with you and I when we come to the
[38:20] end of this thing God's going to say I
[38:22] register one thing one time where you
[38:24] know God's got never going to ask you
[38:26] why it took you so long to come to him
[38:29] he knew how long so all he does it says
[38:32] enter into the joy of the Lord before
[38:33] that I had I had this for you before the
[38:35] foundation of the world you just come
[38:37] what God came down in human flesh and
[38:40] what opened up the way for us to get
[38:43] back and then all right so it's pretty
[38:46] simple in whom we have redemption
[38:49] through his blood the forgiveness of
[38:51] sins according to the riches of His
[38:53] grace now remember if you're born again
[38:55] you cannot sin amen
[39:01] because the seed remains in you and you
[39:03] cannot send a man wherein he has
[39:06] abounded toward us and all wisdom and
[39:08] prudence having made known unto us the
[39:10] mystery of his will that's what he's
[39:12] doing now and then he's making known to
[39:15] us the mystery of the will that he wrote
[39:17] before the foundation of the world all
[39:19] right remember God's thoughts are
[39:22] eternal he never developed a new one
[39:26] never developed a new thought mine what
[39:29] a what a god I was thinking the other
[39:31] day you're exactly right I was thinking
[39:33] the other day one person created all
[39:35] this one person it didn't take a
[39:38] committee it didn't take an army it
[39:41] didn't take four billion nights at one
[39:44] guy every bit of this came from one
[39:47] person amen
[39:51] you did this having made known unto us
[39:54] the mystery of his will according to his
[39:56] good pleasure which he has purposed in
[39:59] himself remember that people that is the
[40:03] unconditional covenant I'm going to do
[40:06] it right you can't
[40:09] and you know what God says I know you
[40:11] can't that's why I'm going to do it
[40:15] right he purposed in himself that in the
[40:20] dispensation of the fullness of times in
[40:23] other words here now the the last two
[40:26] thousand years we come to a place that
[40:28] we got to know these things that he
[40:31] might gather together in one all things
[40:33] in Christ not in two not in three in one
[40:37] all things in Christ both which are in
[40:39] heaven and which are on earth even in
[40:42] him so in other words heaven and earth
[40:44] has come together I'm gonna tell you
[40:46] something one thing's for sure like
[40:48] brother Dale said I'm not wanting to go
[40:49] to heaven heaven to me where you are is
[40:52] where heaven is and that where you are
[40:55] you mean Walmart or among all the tattoo
[40:58] artists and awful the all the half-naked
[41:00] well not even half naked now they're
[41:01] more than half negative two-thirds naked
[41:04] people and you're a walking that's why
[41:07] is it that we are a mystery in ourselves
[41:09] right
[41:12] it's like Bob didn't know what's gonna
[41:15] say this but they were back there
[41:16] talking about being in the world don't
[41:20] you know don't be take the things of the
[41:22] world what you have to be careful with
[41:24] that you got to remember that we're in
[41:26] this world but not on this world we are
[41:28] so different
[41:30] and what is helping us now is though is
[41:33] we've got all these other buffers like
[41:35] denominations and other things but one
[41:37] day you and I the cream of the crop is
[41:39] going to rise to the top and we're going
[41:41] to be so much different so they're going
[41:43] to persecute you just like they
[41:45] persecuted Jesus hey man
[41:48] we'll know then who's in him and who's
[41:50] not like Roseanne you and I were talking
[41:54] about you know you you keep you home you
[41:56] don't own your home you're on your home
[41:58] now right you don't listen you own
[42:01] nothing nothing I tell you why you say
[42:05] this is a free country go try to build a
[42:08] building out and just still try to build
[42:09] a building in your yard
[42:11] if the code says you can't guess what
[42:13] you can't amen is that free no we've
[42:19] lost all my freedom the only freedom we
[42:21] have is what right here in Christ
[42:23] and then in whom also we have obtained
[42:26] an inheritance being predestinated
[42:29] according to the purpose of him who
[42:31] worketh all things after the counsel of
[42:33] his own word we'll all right that we
[42:36] should be to the praise of his glory who
[42:39] first trusted in Christ and whom ye also
[42:40] trusted after you heard the word of
[42:43] truth the gospel of your salvation and
[42:45] whom also after you I don't see how
[42:47] people can read this and think we came
[42:48] here with anything this this tells after
[42:52] after we heard the word you can't get
[42:55] you can't get a word birth without
[42:58] listening and hearing the word first and
[43:01] then the gospel of your salvation and
[43:04] whom also after that you believed
[43:08] Peter I mean Paul came to a group of
[43:12] people that were teaching Jesus was the
[43:16] Christ that's pretty good revelation
[43:18] especially back then they didn't have a
[43:20] book in internet and quote they were
[43:23] just preaching that Jesus was the Christ
[43:26] and Paul perceived one thing they didn't
[43:30] have the holyoke right he said have you
[43:32] received the Holy Ghost since you
[43:35] believe a man and hear what they say
[43:38] their doctrine had been that we don't
[43:41] know this what is it we come by a Holy
[43:42] Ghost that was the house of Cornelius I
[43:45] believe what he said what a stout man
[43:47] beautiful wonderful man teaching Jesus
[43:50] was the Christ didn't have the baptism
[43:51] of the Holy but boy I believe after he
[43:53] got it he was like a house on fire on a
[43:56] windy day it changed that man all right
[43:58] same way with you and I then I'm also
[44:00] after that you believed you were sealed
[44:01] with that Holy Spirit of promise which
[44:03] is the earnest of your inheritance
[44:06] we're going to talk about that a little
[44:07] while but hold this right here which is
[44:09] the earnest of our inheritance until the
[44:11] redemption of the purchased possession
[44:13] until the praise of his glory so your
[44:17] whole your body is not redeemed yet we
[44:20] know that rather they'll cover that this
[44:22] morning just look in the mirror but the
[44:28] earnest of our inheritance in other
[44:30] words we have an inheritance and then we
[44:34] have an inheritance that is signed
[44:37] sealed and delivered and even the way to
[44:42] get back to it has been delivered to us
[44:46] 2,000 years ago how slow are we God came
[44:54] himself preached three and a half years
[44:55] we killed him but we're done with you
[45:00] say we yeah we did I put him on the
[45:02] cross did you okay alright and now it
[45:05] took us two thousand years what that in
[45:07] a dispensation of the fullness of time
[45:09] when we get all the church ages done I
[45:11] was thinking the other day if you did
[45:12] make a checklist of what was coming and
[45:15] what's already gone we're right into
[45:18] coming because there's not a lot more to
[45:20] be done except what's already being done
[45:23] ma'am
[45:24] and we come up now and we see this
[45:27] Eclipse tomorrow and now they're talking
[45:29] about September the 23rd is it something
[45:32] where the Virgo which is the Virgin has
[45:35] 12 stars above our head and I don't get
[45:38] into that stuff much brother Ryan sent
[45:40] me that so I watched it but September
[45:43] 23rd supposed to be the rapture this
[45:44] year well you know what usually usually
[45:47] usually when you say rapture or when you
[45:49] say that that's not going to happen
[45:52] because if the whole world's going to
[45:54] know it then then it's not like a coming
[45:56] as a thief in the night so so it's not
[45:59] going to come honest I promise you it
[46:01] won't come on September 23rd 2017 I'll
[46:03] promise you why because everybody knows
[46:09] already but listen let's not just throw
[46:12] that in the trash because remember God
[46:15] wrote his first Bible in the heavens he
[46:17] wrote his first Bible in the stars and
[46:19] we see these things happening I told
[46:23] them downstairs this morning I said look
[46:24] signs follow what the believers are
[46:27] doing believers don't follow the signs
[46:32] that are happening
[46:34] whatever is happening in the stars
[46:36] because I just read you here that heaven
[46:38] and earth and come together
[46:39] whatever happens up there I'll promise
[46:42] you something's happening to the bride
[46:44] right amen so we've got now September
[46:47] I'm thinking about this September 2017
[46:50] which is getting close and - and it is a
[46:53] significant thing because if you'll
[46:56] remember when I did the thing on Daniel
[46:57] 70 weeks there's three fall feasts that
[47:01] have to be concluded before Jesus comes
[47:05] he he in other words what was it of
[47:09] first fruit anyway there was four it's
[47:12] kind of funny when you preach all this
[47:13] and then you kind of forget it all but
[47:15] he the first for feast he has concluded
[47:20] all those Pentecost firstfruits and all
[47:22] those things there's three left
[47:24] Tabernacle peace of the trumpets and
[47:27] peace of atonement all right which are
[47:29] fall feasts their feast during the
[47:30] harvest time in September September and
[47:33] October that's the harvest time so we
[47:35] see these things happening and brother
[47:37] Daniel now we're talking the other day
[47:39] and he sent me a link where they're now
[47:42] predicting that next October which is
[47:45] 2018 there will be a huge financial
[47:49] crash huge look at the stock market now
[47:53] it's at 20,000 it was at 9,000 just
[47:59] several years ago hey listen this is not
[48:03] a crash that's not a crash but if you
[48:10] take this and put it in top of that
[48:11] 40-foot tree and you drop it down that's
[48:13] the crash so it's got to get good before
[48:16] it gets worse so here we are 2018 we're
[48:19] heading toward 2019 we get in close
[48:22] something is getting ready to happen
[48:24] God's going to show it in the sky but
[48:28] he's not only showing it in the sky
[48:30] listen you and I it's where it's got to
[48:34] show first because those signs will
[48:36] follow what the believers are already
[48:39] doing I was thinking of the day brother
[48:41] man said what God does it he reveals it
[48:44] and then he makes it manifest
[48:47] so once we get to the manifestation part
[48:49] we're already two parts behind that's
[48:52] how God does things that's what he said
[48:54] but let's get back to the let's get back
[48:56] to what we're talking about today
[48:57] Hebrews 9 verse 11 let's read these
[48:59] scriptures and get them over with
[49:00] because I want to touch on something
[49:02] here in just a minute
[49:03] Hebrews 9:11 we read it last Sunday
[49:05] we're going to read it again but Christ
[49:07] being a high priests of good things to
[49:10] come by a greater and more perfect
[49:12] Tabernacle not made with hands that is
[49:15] to say not of this building
[49:16] all right neither by the blood of goats
[49:18] and calves but by his own blood he
[49:20] entered in in one into the holy place
[49:23] having obtained eternal redemption for
[49:27] us all right for if the blood of bulls
[49:29] and of goats and the ashes of a heifer
[49:31] sprinkled in clean sanctified to the
[49:33] purifying of the flesh because remember
[49:36] and watch what happened my heaven
[49:38] because you not see the the the part of
[49:42] this is being fulfilled with all these
[49:43] people coming in from overseas that that
[49:46] that maybe has never heard what we're
[49:48] preaching here and then come in and read
[49:51] the base scriptures bring the same thing
[49:53] in we've been talking about bringing
[49:55] everything together
[49:57] brother land land coming in with the son
[49:59] of man and and did you hear brother
[50:01] Brady last Sunday yeah that was good but
[50:06] he made a statement it was very profound
[50:08] he said that lamb now see we talking
[50:12] about we've been talking about
[50:12] downstairs you know there's a
[50:14] justification that we we go through in
[50:17] what we call baby form justification
[50:19] where you did do what you did you
[50:21] remember that and then but then you were
[50:24] justified and you chopped off your past
[50:27] sense right but now remember if you
[50:29] listen to what brother Brady said last
[50:31] Sunday he says that lamb that lamb was
[50:35] not justified like that that lamb didn't
[50:39] spin and then all of a sudden God
[50:41] forgive him that lamb never sinned in
[50:44] the first place hey man boy I got
[50:48] excited I don't have to get up and shout
[50:50] I can get excited inside amen but he
[50:53] said that lamb never did it there was no
[50:57] sin
[50:58] in that lamb now if there's no sin in
[51:02] the natural lamb what about the Lamb of
[51:05] God that came and gave His life that we
[51:08] can look back and not just say what we
[51:11] did this but now we don't do that
[51:12] anymore the real one we're talking about
[51:15] now never get it in the first place
[51:18] amen who can charge glovesy last who can
[51:27] make a list no one what my Teegarden sir
[51:37] how much more shall the blood of Christ
[51:39] who through the Eternal Spirit offered
[51:40] himself without spot to God purge your
[51:44] conscience from dead works to serve the
[51:46] Living God
[51:47] raise it up and for this cause he is the
[51:53] mediator of the New Testament that by
[51:56] means of death for the redemption of the
[51:58] transgressions that were under the first
[52:00] Testament they meant the first Testament
[52:02] that was the Old Testament that was
[52:04] under bulls and goats right we already
[52:07] been through this I'm just kind of back
[52:08] writing for the ones that wasn't here a
[52:09] couple weeks ago because remember for a
[52:14] testament to be in force there had to be
[52:16] a death of a testator right all right so
[52:18] let's read that continues for this call
[52:20] he is the mediator of the New Testament
[52:21] that by means of death for the
[52:24] redemption of the transgressions that
[52:26] were under the first Testament that they
[52:29] they which are called might receive the
[52:32] promise of eternal inheritance now the
[52:34] Old Testament never received the eternal
[52:37] inheritance because they had to lose
[52:40] back to that substitute blood that lambs
[52:43] blood and then that was the first
[52:46] Testament and they're there their sins
[52:49] were not done away with they were just
[52:51] pushed to Calvary and then so now but
[52:54] look but you see the one that comes that
[52:58] was a testator came right for where a
[53:01] testament is there must also necessity
[53:04] be the death of the testator
[53:07] a man comes remember like we've already
[53:10] said before
[53:12] what's the first book of the New
[53:14] Testament not Matthew not mark not Luke
[53:19] not John the tech tater still alive but
[53:23] after the death of the testator a New
[53:25] Testament is enforced that's what
[53:28] happened next to verse one the eye is
[53:30] your beginning of the New Testament
[53:33] Jesus said this is the New Testament in
[53:34] my blood and then for a testament is of
[53:38] force after men are dead otherwise it is
[53:42] of no strength at all while the testator
[53:45] liveth Jesus didn't save one person he
[53:49] did not fill any one with the Holy Ghost
[53:51] while he was here being Almighty like he
[53:57] breathed on them and said receive the
[53:58] Holy Ghost sure but it was what it was a
[54:00] promise but until that book of Acts when
[54:03] that Holy Ghost came and would come from
[54:05] one dimension into another dimension
[54:07] that's when the promise started to be
[54:10] fulfilled and then where our testament
[54:14] is of force after men are dead otherwise
[54:16] is of no strength at all while the
[54:19] testator liveth all right let's go now
[54:21] to the quote that we use last Sunday and
[54:24] adoption 1960 inheritance by
[54:27] predestination excuse me I inherited
[54:31] something
[54:32] what inheritance there had to be
[54:34] somebody leave me and inheritance why
[54:38] you say Jesus left you an inheritance
[54:41] beg your pardon jesus never left you an
[54:45] inheritance
[54:46] Jesus never left you an inheritance he
[54:49] only came down and paid for your
[54:51] inheritance all of that pay for your
[54:56] inheritance brought you to your
[54:59] inheritance but your name was put on the
[55:02] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[55:04] foundation of the world God give you
[55:07] your inheritance your inheritance was
[55:10] first before predestination before
[55:14] foreknowledge your inheritance was first
[55:17] listen what's the first thing you think
[55:20] of first thing I don't think of this
[55:24] kids when so much
[55:25] how's your family I said well Brad's
[55:27] large they're all good what's not my
[55:32] family
[55:33] they say how's your family josh is doing
[55:36] good Hanna's doing fine damn it's doing
[55:37] well you know what that's the first
[55:39] thing comes you mind right
[55:40] your family's the first thing come to
[55:42] your mind I love other people's family
[55:45] but my family comes first and then Jesus
[55:48] only come a lot here's the way they try
[55:50] to make it God said well there's a lot
[55:53] of people all I don't want them and then
[55:56] says he want in other words he wanted to
[55:58] be safe so I'll send Jesus down and
[56:00] perhaps maybe someday feel sorry and you
[56:03] know what I've done and get saved oh
[56:05] mercy I wouldn't run my office like that
[56:07] even as poor as I do I wouldn't do it
[56:10] like that God by his foreknowledge
[56:12] seeing exactly who would be saved and
[56:15] who wouldn't be saved he sent Jesus to
[56:18] save those that he had already chosen
[56:21] didn't Paul say five verses behind it
[56:24] that he chose us in him before there
[56:26] even was a world that's our heritage God
[56:31] chose us and let Jesus come and pay the
[56:34] price the what his shedding of his blood
[56:37] that no sin would be one read it with me
[56:42] accounted to us nothing you do came n
[56:49] nothing you do make a list you know I
[56:58] did this I did that this is I did that I
[57:01] did like I told you before you know you
[57:03] you say God I really you drive by an old
[57:06] place you should do something wrong or
[57:07] drive by an old beer joint and say but
[57:09] God forgive me for even going in that
[57:10] place and he's like you've been in there
[57:16] you've been in there I don't remember
[57:19] that I'm looking at your inheritance I'm
[57:24] looking at before the foundation of the
[57:25] world all you thought about was me now
[57:31] let's look at this word attribute but
[57:37] if we had an inheritance now surely we
[57:41] give each person inheritance if we have
[57:43] enough but all of our inheritance most
[57:46] of the time goes to what family and then
[57:49] all eventually if I'm going to die to
[57:51] give you that inheritance it's going to
[57:54] go to my family and that's not going to
[57:56] The Devil's kids Jesus died for
[57:59] everybody but he died for his kids
[58:02] mm-hmm
[58:03] when he was on the cross I was on his
[58:06] mind
[58:07] I think another day when that stinking
[58:09] nail went through the palm of his hand
[58:10] didn't the Bible say we were engraved in
[58:12] the palm of his hand sister Jeanne it
[58:14] went right through my name it went right
[58:18] through my name because if I'm imprinted
[58:20] in the palm of his hand that when he
[58:22] hung on that cross that nail went right
[58:24] through my name he said I died for him
[58:27] but look the word attribute brother Dale
[58:30] has been using the word attribute so
[58:32] let's kind of break it down a little bit
[58:33] don't read down here now you're going to
[58:42] read them that's your needs that'll work
[58:43] isn't done them thank you kind of like a
[58:47] lawyer saying strike that yeah right
[58:49] how can you strike that the Lord
[58:52] attribute means a quality or feature
[58:55] regarded as a characteristic now look
[58:57] weird that word inherit come from that
[59:00] word inherit comes from inheritance
[59:02] right some of you can't see raise it up
[59:05] raise it up a little bit because some of
[59:07] them are straining in the back it's a
[59:09] quality or feature regarded as the
[59:12] characteristic or inherent part of
[59:15] someone or something all right
[59:18] the attribute is like brother Dale said
[59:21] they do all then publish boys walk just
[59:23] like brother Kong and if you give Dale
[59:26] few more years he'll do some time but
[59:30] here are some synonyms that go with it
[59:32] watch this quality characteristic trait
[59:36] feature element aspect property sign
[59:43] hallmark our mark now look it's an
[59:47] inherent part of someone
[59:50] I only receive inheritance from my
[59:53] natural father because I came from him
[59:56] you're only going to receive an
[59:58] inheritance for God if you come from him
[1:00:00] and then but now listen here we are with
[1:00:04] these words that we sometimes we I asked
[1:00:09] for Lewis this and he he kind of he got
[1:00:11] it right but now raise it all the way up
[1:00:13] to the top I want you to think about
[1:00:16] this for a man are we an attribute of
[1:00:19] God are we the attribute of God because
[1:00:25] an attribute of God hold on just a
[1:00:27] minute
[1:00:28] we'll see come on we're Satan come from
[1:00:35] he comes from God he was an attribute
[1:00:39] and attribute of God but I'm gonna
[1:00:42] promise you one thing the attribute
[1:00:45] comes straight from that part of God's
[1:00:47] mind that's eternal amen it's DIAC we
[1:00:53] are not an attribute we are the
[1:00:55] attribute of God God made manifest in
[1:00:59] another form listen an attribute of God
[1:01:05] is healer we're not going to need that
[1:01:07] all the time glorified body doesn't need
[1:01:11] healing
[1:01:11] I don't need Reese al vation if i'm
[1:01:19] saved i'm saved i don't and you say well
[1:01:22] you don't need a savior yes i need a
[1:01:24] savior but i'm not going to need that
[1:01:26] savior what's I'm saved how am I going
[1:01:29] to need it No
[1:01:30] so you see an attribute of God could be
[1:01:33] many things but the attribute of God the
[1:01:37] form that comes down that attribute
[1:01:40] comes from that back part that's what I
[1:01:41] was looking at Wednesday night and it's
[1:01:43] probably going to get onto some of his
[1:01:45] sermon but look for knowledge I put for
[1:01:48] knowledge includes and I left it blank
[1:01:50] because foreknowledge includes sin
[1:02:00] but that back part of God mind never
[1:02:04] knew sin so you take for knowledge for
[1:02:10] knowledge as God's seeing what was going
[1:02:12] to happen right but now the attribute of
[1:02:16] God is one doing the scene you guys have
[1:02:22] passed for knowledge back before for
[1:02:25] knowledge for knowledge includes what
[1:02:29] you do down here is a center amen but
[1:02:35] the back part when when the prophet of
[1:02:37] God said let's go in the back part what
[1:02:38] the intelligence of God the back part
[1:02:42] knew no sin the children of God are the
[1:02:46] inherent part of the eternal amen
[1:02:49] because what an attribute means what an
[1:02:52] inherent part of a person I look the way
[1:02:58] I look because I inherited my traits
[1:03:01] from my father and mother and as a
[1:03:06] Christian if we don't want like God we
[1:03:09] always talk about walking like Tom
[1:03:10] publish well let's talk about all could
[1:03:12] want me like God because he's your real
[1:03:15] daddy so that's the attribute the
[1:03:18] attribute is the one that created
[1:03:21] everything that we see the reason the
[1:03:30] attribute is worth that is because it
[1:03:35] developed an attribute you have to think
[1:03:40] of that for a little while because why
[1:03:45] do we need for knowledge and why do we
[1:03:49] need predestination if we never fell
[1:03:55] hello
[1:03:56] why do we need all that we don't but God
[1:04:00] knowing we would fall these attributes
[1:04:03] developed after God already had a group
[1:04:05] of people in his mind that was listen
[1:04:08] that
[1:04:09] 1:26 men never fell you'll get that one
[1:04:13] of these days and when you get born
[1:04:15] again that part never fell that part
[1:04:19] never sinned so it had to come from the
[1:04:23] back part of God's mind but it had to go
[1:04:25] to foreknowledge it had to go into
[1:04:28] predestination because remember
[1:04:29] predestination is pre determined destiny
[1:04:33] why is it a predetermined destiny
[1:04:36] because God saw it happen
[1:04:40] that's pretty simple God and simplicity
[1:04:45] amen but an attribute no let's get
[1:04:50] closer I thinking the other day you know
[1:04:52] we've done a lot of things through the
[1:04:55] message but this to me is we've been
[1:04:59] we've been writing with a dull pencil
[1:05:01] it's time to sharpen the pencil it's
[1:05:05] time to get where the focus is not so
[1:05:07] fuzzy it's time to get to where we can
[1:05:09] see things you know we were talking to
[1:05:13] the people that the Sasquatch people are
[1:05:18] the Bigfoot people and old Tony
[1:05:20] Smallwood he says wise all those
[1:05:21] pictures always blurry
[1:05:24] why wouldn't I think Tony's asking why
[1:05:27] are these pictures always blurry because
[1:05:30] they're not real and I think we've been
[1:05:33] looking at some blurry pictures in our
[1:05:35] life and then our denominational ideas
[1:05:37] and then our carnal mind but when we
[1:05:40] become focused on one thing and that's
[1:05:45] getting rid of the carnal mind showing
[1:05:47] that if we are the attribute of God then
[1:05:50] we are God walking on the earth we are
[1:05:52] God breathing on the earth we are God
[1:05:54] acting on the earth amen because an
[1:06:01] attribute could mean something else
[1:06:08] but the attribute is D person that's the
[1:06:13] person in a mini membered form that God
[1:06:16] had before there was ever you'll get
[1:06:18] this one of these days this Bible was
[1:06:21] written to
[1:06:22] get you here and get you out of here
[1:06:26] hey man because that's what that well
[1:06:28] done he gave you an inheritance it told
[1:06:31] you about your inheritance that there
[1:06:33] was before it was even written the
[1:06:35] reason God wrote that Bible is because
[1:06:38] he saw the inheritance of a group of
[1:06:41] people eternal because remember God has
[1:06:48] known you thought his thoughts are
[1:06:51] eternal let's read that summary in
[1:06:53] Church a I pull this one up just this
[1:06:55] morning cuz it kind of struck me him
[1:06:56] just watch carefully now and see this
[1:06:59] let the Prophet explain it before there
[1:07:03] was ever expect a starter before God was
[1:07:06] God right wake up before God was God God
[1:07:14] is an object later' ation and no one was
[1:07:16] there to worship him so he was at that
[1:07:19] time only potentially God but we were
[1:07:24] there we're not developing after this
[1:07:29] right I love that and he was all known
[1:07:34] only as Eternal Spirit the bride was
[1:07:41] already in his mind yes she was she was
[1:07:46] existing in his thoughts and what about
[1:07:49] these thoughts of God they are eternal
[1:07:52] are they not so now if his thoughts are
[1:07:55] eternal this part of his talks now not
[1:07:56] everything he was thinking not
[1:07:59] everything he was thinking is eternal a
[1:08:01] man called you thought of Judas he
[1:08:03] thought of all the sin of the world he
[1:08:04] saw thought of all these things but he's
[1:08:06] talking about right here the bride was
[1:08:09] already in his mind they are eternal are
[1:08:12] they not the eternal thoughts of God let
[1:08:14] me ask you are the thoughts of God
[1:08:16] eternal if you can see this you will see
[1:08:18] many things God is unchangeable in both
[1:08:21] essence and behavior we have studied
[1:08:24] that and proven that already God is
[1:08:27] infinite in his ability so therefore he
[1:08:29] has gone must be omniscient if he is
[1:08:32] omniscient then he is not now learning
[1:08:35] nor is he taking counsel even with
[1:08:38] himself what do you think about that
[1:08:44] there's nobody to ask they still might
[1:08:48] ask well you mean that there's one
[1:08:50] garden he's asking a bunch of people no
[1:08:52] one God right what about what about a
[1:08:59] thought you know we we think things all
[1:09:01] the time and they don't come to pass
[1:09:02] like 950 out of 950
[1:09:08] but everything God thinks of comes to
[1:09:10] pass and if we're a part of that thought
[1:09:17] we're gonna get here in a minute he is
[1:09:21] omniscient that he is not now learning
[1:09:23] or he taking counsel even for himself
[1:09:25] nor is he at any time adding to his
[1:09:28] knowledge in other words he's not going
[1:09:30] to come up to the end ago oh I forgot 10
[1:09:33] people I'll - oh no done finished
[1:09:36] settled done because we remember if he
[1:09:40] has to add more people he's got to add
[1:09:43] to this he's got to add to this if he
[1:09:47] adds more people if he takes away he's
[1:09:50] got to take away this is it if he can
[1:09:54] add to his knowledge than he is not
[1:09:55] omniscient the best we could say is that
[1:09:58] sometimes he will be but that is not
[1:10:00] scripted right he is omniscient he has
[1:10:02] never had a new thought about anything
[1:10:05] because all his thoughts he has always
[1:10:07] had and always will have and knows the
[1:10:10] end from the beginning because he has
[1:10:12] got thus the thoughts of God are eternal
[1:10:15] they are real they are not simply like a
[1:10:19] man with a blueprint he has drawn up in
[1:10:21] which one day will be translated into
[1:10:22] substance and form but they are all
[1:10:25] ready real and eternal and part of God
[1:10:29] now he's knocked off by the whole world
[1:10:30] he's not known about everything that he
[1:10:32] thought about he saying he thought about
[1:10:33] his bride he's talking about you and I
[1:10:36] know watch continues see how this works
[1:10:38] God always had his thoughts for Adam
[1:10:40] Adam as his thoughts was yet unexpressed
[1:10:45] Thoms 139 15 we'll give you a little
[1:10:49] idea
[1:10:49] this my substance was not hid from thee
[1:10:51] when I was made in secret and curiously
[1:10:53] wrought in the lost parts of the earth
[1:10:54] thine eyes did see my substance yet
[1:10:57] being unperfect and in thy book were all
[1:11:03] my members written which in continuance
[1:11:06] in other words as they come which in
[1:11:09] continuance were fashioned when as yet
[1:11:12] there was none of them
[1:11:14] Jacob Esau already had saw that before
[1:11:18] they got here Jeremiah in your womb I
[1:11:21] knew what you'd be that as I said was
[1:11:24] not written about Adam but it gives you
[1:11:26] the idea and knowledge that the thought
[1:11:28] was there in his mind and that thought
[1:11:30] was eternal and had to be expressed
[1:11:33] so when item was formed to the dust of
[1:11:35] the earth and his spiritual being
[1:11:36] created by God then Adam became God's
[1:11:39] spot expressed and those eternal
[1:11:42] thoughts were now manifested down to the
[1:11:45] centuries we could go we find a Moses a
[1:11:48] Jeremiah John the Baptist each one of
[1:11:50] these were God's eternal thought
[1:11:52] expressed in its season then we come to
[1:11:56] Jesus the logo he was the perfect and
[1:12:00] complete thought expressed and he became
[1:12:03] known as the word John 1 in the
[1:12:07] beginning was word word God what was
[1:12:09] done all right that is what he is and
[1:12:12] forever will be and I thought we were in
[1:12:15] him I thought we were in him ok so
[1:12:19] whatever speaks to him speak to us and
[1:12:22] then now it says that he has chosen us
[1:12:24] in him what we tell my sons this morning
[1:12:26] before the foundation world that means
[1:12:28] that we were right there with him in the
[1:12:31] mind and thoughts of God before the
[1:12:34] foundation of the world this is the part
[1:12:37] I want you to see that gives an eternal
[1:12:39] quality to the elect you can't get away
[1:12:43] from that amen
[1:12:45] that's how listens that's how you and I
[1:12:49] can exist in this life because we have
[1:12:54] an eternal quality that no one else has
[1:12:58] I'm saying no one else has
[1:13:04] we came from God and we're going back to
[1:13:07] God
[1:13:08] amen if you never were in God you're not
[1:13:10] going back to God because what do you
[1:13:12] got to go back to Amen you not got well
[1:13:16] like that Jesus is going up wine on this
[1:13:19] one or - no he's got it all it's done
[1:13:22] it's finished what our problem is is we
[1:13:25] got separated from it
[1:13:27] amen I tell them this morning I'll tell
[1:13:31] you our carnal mind is what's killing us
[1:13:37] you and I I know there's children here
[1:13:40] but they're going to learn sometimes you
[1:13:42] and I came from a carnal sex act between
[1:13:44] your mom and your daddy I don't care if
[1:13:46] it with your physical mom and daddy but
[1:13:48] it was a man and a woman got together
[1:13:50] had a carnal thought and had you they in
[1:13:54] a person I think about that the other
[1:13:55] day was walking somewhere and I said I
[1:13:57] ain't a person any different than me
[1:13:59] we're all born the same way we come from
[1:14:02] the same place
[1:14:03] by the same act and that's our problem
[1:14:08] that was act was not supposed to happen
[1:14:12] but he did because the natre beauty of
[1:14:15] God had to be displayed called Savior
[1:14:18] healer Redeemer all those great words
[1:14:22] that we look at how to come forth
[1:14:24] because it was already anything but who
[1:14:27] made them come out who made them come
[1:14:32] out the devil's kit huh who did then did
[1:14:38] you do that
[1:14:39] yeah you did you did you made it go say
[1:14:43] no not the devil's kid you made it come
[1:14:47] out you made that happen cuz he knew we
[1:14:52] were going to get lost so we had to make
[1:14:54] a way to get us back amen
[1:14:57] but he knew where you came from he'll
[1:15:01] not lose the one because it stalks
[1:15:03] return and in the continuance of us
[1:15:07] being born we were all born in sin all
[1:15:09] shape is iniquity I can't understand why
[1:15:11] people in this message think we were
[1:15:13] born so much special name by hell
[1:15:15] we were born in a hospital or a woodpile
[1:15:17] or a woodshed or turn we always born at
[1:15:19] home but we were all going to same
[1:15:22] identical way and that is not the way
[1:15:26] that God wanted us to come right so we
[1:15:31] all start the same place there is not
[1:15:35] your even Bill Gates was born the same
[1:15:38] way you were huh
[1:15:43] so how much more better is he than you
[1:15:45] you just got the money the inspection to
[1:15:46] leave is a pocket right didn't have it
[1:15:51] you don't know what you love just enough
[1:15:55] money to get by and that's all I want
[1:15:57] amen
[1:15:59] bill no treasure here but think about
[1:16:02] this the reason God every move that God
[1:16:06] made was because you I've told you
[1:16:11] before makinia one more time this Bible
[1:16:14] was not written for the world it was not
[1:16:21] written for anyone but the children of
[1:16:24] God that's the only way you're going to
[1:16:27] develop that's the only thing you're
[1:16:30] going to eat and it tells you where yet
[1:16:35] and where you go and tells you where you
[1:16:39] came from who needs a GPF we've got
[1:16:45] God's predestinated seed that's the only
[1:16:48] GPS I need and you know what it finds
[1:16:51] itself all the time there is no
[1:16:53] recalculating and God I've heard that
[1:16:56] enough hand you heard that recalculating
[1:16:58] no this other right we were somewhere
[1:17:03] one time with Terrence and Emily it told
[1:17:05] us to get out walk didn't not Lisa is it
[1:17:10] get out walk in other words you can't
[1:17:12] get there from where you're at you had
[1:17:14] to park you walk where you were going I
[1:17:16] never heard that before
[1:17:17] but God doesn't say that he knows
[1:17:20] exactly the whole thing coming right
[1:17:22] down you know what we're doing that is
[1:17:24] pretty funny innit
[1:17:34] but not in God you hadn't docked God he
[1:17:38] didn't lead you off over there and have
[1:17:39] sin recalculating or back up or 300 feet
[1:17:42] you you missed it
[1:17:44] we had a TomTom one time when I was
[1:17:46] working for Terrance and I call it a
[1:17:47] dum-dum instead of a TomTom sorry TomTom
[1:17:51] but Garmin is better but at TomTom you'd
[1:17:54] be back you'd be about thirty feet
[1:17:55] behind already past the road you
[1:17:58] supposed to turn and says turn right
[1:18:02] you'd be that you'd be thirty feet this
[1:18:04] away you know that's not with God God
[1:18:07] knew wherever seed would land and I
[1:18:11] understand what brother Brown said he
[1:18:12] said you know he said the the the virgin
[1:18:15] birth is not so mysterious God created
[1:18:18] one seed right one ovum puts it in Mary
[1:18:23] it forms a baby you and I get in here
[1:18:27] you and I get in here is a mystery but
[1:18:32] thank God for a prophet that said God
[1:18:34] bred this one to this one this one to
[1:18:36] this one and this one to this one just
[1:18:38] to get you here you know why because you
[1:18:41] had to be here you were part of his mind
[1:18:44] you were part of what he always wanted
[1:18:49] hey it's not a lot of mystery all this
[1:18:55] is going on that's why you know the
[1:18:57] property God preached his greatest
[1:18:59] sermons but he preached Garlin
[1:19:00] simplicity first God hiding himself in
[1:19:04] simplicity all right let's continue here
[1:19:08] just for a second if that's all right
[1:19:09] we're still going to get to that last
[1:19:10] quote but we'll try all right questions
[1:19:12] and answers on Hebrews watch we read
[1:19:16] this last Sunday more read again because
[1:19:17] this makes you very important I tell you
[1:19:19] what let's skip it down to the next one
[1:19:23] questions in that so let's go to the
[1:19:25] number two right there now in other
[1:19:28] words I want you to look now we're
[1:19:30] talking like the thoughts of God we're
[1:19:31] talking like the attribute of God all
[1:19:33] right we're selling the attribute and
[1:19:35] the thoughts of God the thoughts of you
[1:19:37] all right and
[1:19:39] other words when you became a young man
[1:19:40] or a young woman like God takes a
[1:19:42] picture of you now no matter how old and
[1:19:45] wrinkled how disfigured whatever it will
[1:19:46] be that will wind right on down through
[1:19:48] and that body may be destroyed
[1:19:50] disfigured burnt ate up by lines
[1:19:52] whatever it is but it was made up of
[1:19:54] gases 16 elements of the earth that was
[1:19:56] calcium potash petroleum talked about
[1:19:58] this cosmic light and so forth all goes
[1:20:01] together to make up the body now no
[1:20:05] matter what the whole earth is filled
[1:20:06] with that but I look keep going look but
[1:20:11] now this picture is the main thing then
[1:20:15] in the resurrection those gases of acids
[1:20:18] and things comes right back into the
[1:20:20] place and develops this picture again
[1:20:23] now this picture was not taken when you
[1:20:26] were 16 or 18 or 20 years old at your
[1:20:30] best in other words it wasn't taken down
[1:20:32] here as a photo of you at that age God
[1:20:38] didn't come down into this dimension and
[1:20:40] go when I send EOS up when you're 16
[1:20:42] years old click no because remember many
[1:20:45] times some of you did wasn't serving the
[1:20:46] Lord you had short hair you had makeup
[1:20:48] on you had all these different things
[1:20:49] that's nobody took a picture but now
[1:20:53] look when was it taken before there was
[1:21:02] a foundation of the world it was put in
[1:21:05] God's great file where is God's great
[1:21:10] files he got to go look through and pull
[1:21:11] this one out and write where just great
[1:21:15] file that's why I listen we are so
[1:21:18] preserved in God when he saw that
[1:21:21] picture that was before everything
[1:21:25] that's his kids he takes that picture it
[1:21:29] puts it in that file and the only thing
[1:21:32] it did was feature itself here for you
[1:21:35] to make your choice you saw it sounds
[1:21:36] like we can't make a choice it's because
[1:21:38] of your choice it's because of your
[1:21:41] choice see then you become a servant of
[1:21:44] God him for knowing it makes him a
[1:21:47] redeemer as we've been through then that
[1:21:50] picture is absolutely this is the neck
[1:21:53] the negative part of life is where
[1:21:55] you're living now and anything if
[1:21:58] there's a negative there's got to be a
[1:22:00] positive before there can be a negative
[1:22:02] therefore if this is a negative there's
[1:22:05] got to be a positive somewhere and this
[1:22:08] ain't the real thing this is only a
[1:22:10] foreshadow of the real thing that is to
[1:22:13] come now you get it because look this is
[1:22:15] not the real thing the real thing is the
[1:22:19] part inside of us that we can't see the
[1:22:22] real thing it but but where did it come
[1:22:24] from where did it come from where'd it
[1:22:28] come preacher not you where do you come
[1:22:29] from where did it come from
[1:22:32] it comes from the mind of God
[1:22:35] it came straight from the mind of God
[1:22:38] listen there's no wavering and eternal
[1:22:41] you know it's like well no it's eternal
[1:22:45] it's constant that's the only thing in
[1:22:49] your life this constant is your new
[1:22:51] birth that new birth is the most caught
[1:22:54] that's your capos that's what you go
[1:22:56] back to sure we have problems in the
[1:22:58] world
[1:22:58] sure we have problems with life sure
[1:23:00] with but you got to go back to that
[1:23:02] compost God said Who I am man didn't
[1:23:06] tell me who I was God told me who I was
[1:23:08] so I don't care what they do with you
[1:23:12] they cannot destroy that profile why
[1:23:15] because God has known you thought the
[1:23:18] thought he had is that and then whose is
[1:23:21] that alright say man they cannot destroy
[1:23:24] that profile they who people in the
[1:23:26] world people that tell you things up
[1:23:28] preacher they cannot destroy that
[1:23:32] profile that picture in God's great
[1:23:35] gallery up there it cannot destroy it's
[1:23:38] in heaven you burn it up feed it to the
[1:23:41] lines do it any way you want to it will
[1:23:44] come forth again just as sure as two and
[1:23:46] two is four gets insurance God spoke it
[1:23:49] it will come forth so no matter where
[1:23:53] you are no matter where you are can't
[1:23:59] destroy it
[1:24:00] man's tried to destroy it with doctrine
[1:24:02] man's tried to destroy it with you ain't
[1:24:05] there sand you ain't that
[1:24:06] or you're this and you're that but when
[1:24:09] we come back to God's Word that's what I
[1:24:11] was telling downstairs
[1:24:12] we had a prophet coming the end time now
[1:24:15] he didn't bring us something different
[1:24:17] he didn't write an extra Bible he said
[1:24:21] those seven thunders would be what would
[1:24:23] be what's revealed in the field not
[1:24:26] another book not another something
[1:24:29] coming if he was a word prophet he had
[1:24:33] to be in the word and those thunders has
[1:24:36] to be in that word amen
[1:24:38] so the seven thunders are what contained
[1:24:41] in those sealed now called them it's
[1:24:43] downstairs and we'll get into this maybe
[1:24:45] when we get back from from Oklahoma
[1:24:48] there's only one thing that now is
[1:24:51] constant brother Brown said one time and
[1:24:56] one time only he said hold that word
[1:24:58] Redemption the whole Bible the whole
[1:25:03] Bible is Redemption he said well if this
[1:25:06] is Redemption to get us back to God we
[1:25:11] had to have this will we had to have his
[1:25:13] word to get us back to God
[1:25:15] right we had to have that so like I said
[1:25:18] that's what's constant Redemption you
[1:25:23] know and I'm sorry to say this but Bobby
[1:25:30] Lewis and him go outside and start
[1:25:31] talking to other people about what we
[1:25:34] talked about here and they look at you
[1:25:36] like what world are you wrong
[1:25:41] so the Daniels been through it too but
[1:25:45] there's people this message cannot see
[1:25:46] that the seven seals is a book of
[1:25:48] redemption being rude to be home they
[1:25:52] think must be this the book of the devil
[1:25:54] because they think that's what it does
[1:25:56] is revealed the devil there is no book
[1:25:58] of revealing the devil there's a book of
[1:26:01] redemption that exposes the devil tells
[1:26:04] you of his tactics tells you what he's
[1:26:07] going to do but it tells you what God's
[1:26:10] already done for you
[1:26:15] and it won't change God won't say no
[1:26:18] let's try something different now it's
[1:26:20] there resist the devil he'll flee from
[1:26:23] you that's pretty rough you love the
[1:26:30] Lord everybody this is getting good and
[1:26:33] good or the pencils getting sharp but
[1:26:36] remember I mean we spent all these time
[1:26:38] always timing on preaching on Redemption
[1:26:41] and getting us back and and then you got
[1:26:44] people in the message that well brother
[1:26:46] Brian I'm open seals in 1963 and I said
[1:26:50] that's just it the greatest message ever
[1:26:55] preaching is entire life
[1:26:57] and that's it well why didn't we take a
[1:27:01] rat trawler I thought that's what we're
[1:27:04] waiting on it's a revelation contained
[1:27:06] in those seals that will give us rights
[1:27:08] ring faith well there's no one who the
[1:27:10] devil is going to give addressing but no
[1:27:13] but knowing where we come from knowing
[1:27:17] what we're doing here and knowing where
[1:27:20] we're going that's going to show us that
[1:27:23] GPS is going to go off you're here final
[1:27:29] destination has been reached and then
[1:27:37] final destination has been reached give
[1:27:42] me about ten more men who is this mill
[1:27:44] Cassady we're going to get to this now
[1:27:46] let's read this I want to break it down
[1:27:48] for you a little bit we're talking about
[1:27:50] the connection all right then all right
[1:27:52] now watch what's going on here this is
[1:27:56] 1965 this is after the seals are open I
[1:27:58] want to say one more word about that
[1:28:00] because the revelation contained in
[1:28:02] those seals has to be in the Bible and
[1:28:04] like I said before like I said before
[1:28:06] this Bible is a book of what Redemption
[1:28:10] to Christians amen your body changes in
[1:28:14] that Bible and that's what we're heading
[1:28:17] to that body changes the resurrection is
[1:28:20] in that Bible we which are alive
[1:28:24] remain shall not prevent our hinder
[1:28:27] those who are sleep so right now we in
[1:28:34] the we part and the one that's going on
[1:28:37] as is in those part a man and if we pass
[1:28:40] on will go to the doze part but there's
[1:28:42] at least one person going to be in the
[1:28:43] we part we which are alive and remain
[1:28:46] shall not prevent or hinder that's why I
[1:28:50] said I'm not looking for a Raptor Raptor
[1:28:53] cannot come until the resurrection
[1:28:56] happens first and then a body change
[1:29:01] happens next then the rapture will take
[1:29:04] place Amen that's why I believe that
[1:29:08] people number one they're lazy message
[1:29:11] people they don't study we're brother
[1:29:14] Brown open the seals beautiful a button
[1:29:16] come on people I love the Bible said
[1:29:19] study to show yourself approved study to
[1:29:22] show yourself approved amen
[1:29:29] problem is if you get lazy when we when
[1:29:32] we say while we're just sorry we'll just
[1:29:35] wait till the Prophet gets back and
[1:29:36] he'll tell us thus says the Lord if he
[1:29:44] comes back and you're not born again you
[1:29:47] have no hope redemption is over when you
[1:29:52] see that little prophet walk back among
[1:29:54] us we're done it's finished
[1:29:57] we got no more on this earth because
[1:30:02] when he walks back in that glorified
[1:30:03] body we which are alive and remain shall
[1:30:06] be changed
[1:30:11] that all right I hope it in her nobody's
[1:30:14] feelings that's just way out there
[1:30:18] there's see there's no separation in the
[1:30:20] Bible if we have a resurrection of the
[1:30:23] dead things from Paul's age all the way
[1:30:26] to right now there is no differentiation
[1:30:29] sure the last will be first and the
[1:30:30] first shall be last I believe brother
[1:30:32] around be the first one out the grave I
[1:30:33] just understood he had enough work
[1:30:38] but not too perfect you I'll promise you
[1:30:43] you're getting that right now lazy
[1:30:45] people say he's coming and going to give
[1:30:48] me something that's lazy people
[1:30:50] sorry you better have it now because I
[1:30:55] promise you Moses God shut the door
[1:31:00] Moses didn't shut the doors God shut the
[1:31:03] door and he said no more in and you know
[1:31:07] what it didn't rain for seven days with
[1:31:10] him sitting in that Ark hey man that
[1:31:13] alright alright now let's finish this up
[1:31:19] now we see the attribute now here we go
[1:31:22] back to after now we see the attribute
[1:31:23] sons of his spirit have not yet entered
[1:31:26] into the Word form body now what's he
[1:31:28] talking about this body if you're born
[1:31:31] again you already have the word form
[1:31:33] buddy hey man alright
[1:31:35] how would you want to break this down
[1:31:37] for you you have not yet entered into
[1:31:41] the word form body but at the oppening
[1:31:44] this body is subject to the word listen
[1:31:48] and earnest waiting for the earnest
[1:31:51] change of the body all right so you see
[1:31:54] what he's talking about now the
[1:31:57] difference between him and somebody
[1:31:58] Jesus Christ and you as a son see he was
[1:32:02] at the beginning the word anamorphic
[1:32:06] body he came in and lived in that in the
[1:32:10] person of Melchizedek now remember
[1:32:12] Melchizedek could not be your Savior
[1:32:14] because he was just a body formed God
[1:32:18] stepped in that body when he got
[1:32:20] finished with it he dropped it now look
[1:32:22] that's not your brother
[1:32:23] that's not your kinsman Melchizedek
[1:32:27] could not be your kinsman redeemer
[1:32:28] because Melchizedek was spoken into
[1:32:30] existence spoke out you're not spoken
[1:32:32] into existence of spoke out right you
[1:32:35] come a baby like Jesus had to come a
[1:32:37] baby so he had to be a kinsman redeemer
[1:32:41] kin to you kinsmen means kinfolk then
[1:32:45] later we never heard no more of milk
[1:32:47] hesitate because he became Jesus cry
[1:32:49] I Melchizedek was the priest but he
[1:32:53] became Jesus Christ
[1:32:55] now you bypass that you can take your
[1:32:59] soul and put it another soul and this
[1:33:01] soul please no soul right you bypass
[1:33:03] that but now watch keep going because he
[1:33:10] became Jesus Christ no because it was a
[1:33:11] priest but he became Jesus Christ now
[1:33:13] you bypass that because remember you did
[1:33:15] not come word for him first you weren't
[1:33:21] you weren't be Christ let me put it that
[1:33:23] the V in there you were not be Christ
[1:33:25] okay
[1:33:26] watch now you bypass that because in
[1:33:32] that form
[1:33:33] he knows all things he stood up one day
[1:33:37] and he said before Abraham was I am God
[1:33:41] no we did not not we got to that part
[1:33:45] yet but but Larry's but they're going
[1:33:48] like this I like participate but you
[1:33:52] come to a place that you bypass that he
[1:33:55] knew all things he said God give us what
[1:33:59] in other words with the Saints there wha
[1:34:02] John 17 the prayer that God that Jesus
[1:34:06] prayed let us have what in other words
[1:34:08] communion like before the foundation of
[1:34:10] the world okay so so he knew because
[1:34:13] remember he could go back he could quote
[1:34:15] scripture because he was scripture and
[1:34:19] he he wasn't a second person he was D
[1:34:21] scripture made manifest so when he
[1:34:23] walked out he was just that word made
[1:34:26] manifest
[1:34:26] alright now you bypass that because you
[1:34:29] didn't remember you didn't walk out a
[1:34:31] mom and daddy be in the word are you did
[1:34:35] you did not and you have never been able
[1:34:40] to know that yet yet yet yet but we will
[1:34:45] right I believe we're doing it now I
[1:34:48] believe we're learning you've come like
[1:34:52] Adam like me you became from the
[1:34:55] attribute attribute to the flesh quit
[1:35:00] moving out so fast I can't read it to be
[1:35:03] tempted
[1:35:04] but when this life is finished here if
[1:35:07] this earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we
[1:35:08] have one already waiting that's where we
[1:35:11] go
[1:35:11] that is the word then we can look back
[1:35:15] and see what we've done
[1:35:18] remember those ones across the current
[1:35:20] I'm told brother Branham said you're a
[1:35:22] great one on earth you got to go back to
[1:35:24] earth they were telling him what he was
[1:35:25] doing why because there's no carnal mind
[1:35:29] in that sixth dimension
[1:35:30] there's no carnal mind in that six
[1:35:33] dimension that's the mind of God amen
[1:35:39] then we can look back and see what we've
[1:35:41] done now we don't understand it
[1:35:43] we have never become too wordy so my
[1:35:46] good luck brother we never become the
[1:35:48] word this has never become the word
[1:35:50] right this this is Mama and Daddy
[1:35:54] they're sitting here today I'm proof
[1:35:56] where I came from
[1:35:57] now we don't understand it we have never
[1:36:00] become the word we've just become the
[1:36:02] flesh man not the word but look and
[1:36:06] clearly makes it clear you will never be
[1:36:10] the word unless you was a thought at the
[1:36:14] beginning that proves the predestination
[1:36:18] of God see you can't be the word unless
[1:36:21] you're a thought amen
[1:36:25] you had to be into thinking but you see
[1:36:30] in order to stand temptation you had to
[1:36:33] bypass the theophany you bypass that
[1:36:37] Genesis 1:26 members and then you come
[1:36:41] right over that when running the flesh
[1:36:43] then what we say brother Brown you know
[1:36:45] the your giving up you're giving a a
[1:36:48] soul by God are you giving a nature the
[1:36:51] nature is the carnal mind is telling us
[1:36:52] downstairs listen kid kids below the age
[1:36:58] of accountability are so innocent right
[1:37:00] the carnal mind has not been developed
[1:37:03] yet that's why God loves the innocence
[1:37:05] of a child and then all babies go to
[1:37:07] heaven why because they haven't had that
[1:37:10] carnal mind now when you get 12 13 14 is
[1:37:12] what I said before take a 5 year old
[1:37:14] girl and a 5 year old boy and put
[1:37:17] the bathtub they're going to play with
[1:37:18] toys and they're going to throw soaping
[1:37:20] each other and they're going to and not
[1:37:22] paint one thing about it but now you
[1:37:24] take them same to ten years later put a
[1:37:28] fifteen year old girl in the bathtub and
[1:37:30] a 15 year old boy in the bathtub you got
[1:37:32] a hole the rubber ducky goes out why
[1:37:36] what has changed right here they still
[1:37:41] got the same body parts they had when
[1:37:42] they were five it's what the carnal mind
[1:37:45] is our problem
[1:37:47] it's enmity the Bible says to God but
[1:37:51] when we take the mind of Christ and we
[1:37:53] see how all this happened we get a
[1:37:56] beautiful picture of where we come from
[1:37:58] and our purpose to be here
[1:38:01] all right look but in order to stand
[1:38:05] tense because look look the theophany of
[1:38:07] God Genesis 1:26 men one more time never
[1:38:12] fail it doesn't need redemption
[1:38:18] it is redemption sergeant wounds cream
[1:38:22] it is redemption if not it is God it's
[1:38:27] God God God and nothing but God you had
[1:38:31] to come here in flesh though to display
[1:38:34] those other attributes of the Almighty
[1:38:37] God of your father and then if you stand
[1:38:39] all the father hath given me will come
[1:38:41] to me and I'll raise him up the last day
[1:38:43] see you had to be first and then you see
[1:38:47] he comes right down the regular line
[1:38:49] from attribute before the foundation of
[1:38:52] the world
[1:38:53] his name is put on the Lamb's Book of
[1:38:55] Life how much you then from that he
[1:38:58] become the words at the offing I always
[1:39:00] talk about Jesus that could appear and
[1:39:02] disappear now you and I knew that we
[1:39:04] didn't appear and then disappear and
[1:39:06] then appear Jesus did a man then he
[1:39:10] became flesh and returned back again
[1:39:13] resurrected that same body in a
[1:39:16] glorified condition but you bypass the
[1:39:20] Genesis 1:26 man come and put that in
[1:39:23] there that Alright a man you bypass the
[1:39:26] Genesis 1:26 man and became flesh man to
[1:39:29] be tempted by
[1:39:30] sin and then if this earthly tabernacle
[1:39:33] is dissolved we have one already waiting
[1:39:35] we have not yet the body you're not in
[1:39:37] the glorified body today hello if this
[1:39:42] is glorified body Lord give me something
[1:39:44] yes okay so give me something else I'm
[1:39:48] in a glorified body but look when wait a
[1:39:57] minute let's read this but look when
[1:40:03] this body was always eternal that's not
[1:40:06] what that said isn't it says when this
[1:40:09] body receives the Spirit of God
[1:40:15] let's mean you got to receive something
[1:40:17] that you didn't have previously before
[1:40:20] and what is it the immortal life inside
[1:40:25] of you
[1:40:25] it rose this body and subjection to God
[1:40:29] hallelujah why because all that
[1:40:32] attribute you want like God yeah you
[1:40:38] think like God but remember we're never
[1:40:42] God is one person we're now a many
[1:40:44] membered persons amen
[1:40:46] many members person not persons he this
[1:40:51] born of God does not commit sin he
[1:40:55] cannot sin Romans 8:1 there's therefore
[1:40:57] now no condemnation to them that are in
[1:41:00] Christ Jesus they walk not after the
[1:41:02] flesh but after the spirit there you are
[1:41:04] see that throws that body in subjection
[1:41:08] a body subject like you women claiming
[1:41:10] you got the Holy Ghost and going out
[1:41:12] here wearing shorts and things how could
[1:41:14] you do that how could the Spirit of God
[1:41:15] and you ever let you do such a thing
[1:41:17] it just can't be look what he said
[1:41:19] certainly it can't be he's not a filthy
[1:41:21] spirit he's a Holy Spirit man that's why
[1:41:25] I said that old nature that we leaned on
[1:41:27] we look like that we drink the beer we
[1:41:32] cut our hair we've curves we lean toward
[1:41:34] that old nature but I thought when the
[1:41:37] nature of God which is contrary to that
[1:41:40] nature that nature dies
[1:41:43] you don't do those things anymore right
[1:41:46] right the things I used to do he quoted
[1:41:49] that the other day and he made a bunch
[1:41:50] of them for y'all to put on their
[1:41:51] refrigerators the things I used to do
[1:41:53] I'd do them no more right and then when
[1:41:56] you become subject to that spirit or in
[1:42:00] other words we're talking about to life
[1:42:02] you got to be subject to this life the
[1:42:06] life that I now live Paul says I live by
[1:42:09] the faith of the Son of God it throws
[1:42:11] your whole being subject to that spirit
[1:42:13] and that spirit is nothing in the world
[1:42:16] but this seed word made manifest our
[1:42:20] quickened hallelujah may live when the
[1:42:23] Bible says don't do this that body
[1:42:24] quickly turns to it there is no question
[1:42:27] and what is it it's the earnest of your
[1:42:31] resurrection this body will be raised up
[1:42:34] again because it's already what already
[1:42:37] what started it was what subject to sin
[1:42:43] and mire in corruption but now it's got
[1:42:46] the earnest it's turned heavenly now
[1:42:49] that's the earnest that you're going in
[1:42:51] the rapture if the earnest a sick person
[1:42:54] laying dying nothing left but death
[1:42:56] that's all can happen I've seen a shadow
[1:42:58] people don't eat up with cancer and
[1:43:00] tuberculosis see them people a little
[1:43:02] while after that perfectly normal and
[1:43:04] strong if there is no divine healing
[1:43:06] there is no resurrection because divine
[1:43:09] healing is the earnest of the
[1:43:12] resurrection listen you can be healed
[1:43:14] one day of cancer and died the next day
[1:43:16] of cancer but you are healed one day but
[1:43:19] I'll promise you one thing well we get a
[1:43:21] glorified body it's not going to be in
[1:43:23] corrupt one day and in corrupt annexed
[1:43:25] and corrupt one day and corrupting it no
[1:43:28] it is incorruptible for eternity you say
[1:43:33] how's that going to happen I can't
[1:43:35] figure it out because I got all this and
[1:43:36] all this it's not for you to figure
[1:43:38] though tell me how Jesus eat fish and
[1:43:42] walk through a wall you know what the
[1:43:46] earnest money is don't just a down
[1:43:47] payment he was wounded for our
[1:43:48] transgressions with his stripes were
[1:43:50] healed
[1:43:51] notice how wonderful we love him now
[1:43:54] this body is subject to the spin
[1:43:56] you have not yet entered into the word
[1:44:00] form but we are still in the flesh form
[1:44:02] but subject to the word we're subject to
[1:44:05] watch inside and then death in the flesh
[1:44:08] will take us there
[1:44:10] then look when a man is born again he
[1:44:14] becomes at what spirit baby crying and
[1:44:17] then when this robe of flesh is dropped
[1:44:20] there is a he calls it a natural body
[1:44:22] there is a natural body remember this is
[1:44:25] not so this is not what it's supposed to
[1:44:28] be this is the negative we say well does
[1:44:31] this pot this is discipline that's
[1:44:33] negative this is negative there is a
[1:44:37] natural body theophany a body not made
[1:44:40] with hands neither born of a woman so
[1:44:43] look you see how the mind of Christ when
[1:44:45] it comes to you it can't bring you
[1:44:47] carnal falls it can't bring the carnal
[1:44:49] mind to you you already got the carnal
[1:44:52] mind you're trying to get rid of that
[1:44:54] and the mind of Christ when it comes
[1:44:57] there's nothing carnal about God so if
[1:45:01] you have a carnal thought you know what
[1:45:02] the hello devil because it ain't God
[1:45:06] then when a man is born again from
[1:45:09] heaven he becomes the spirit babe in
[1:45:11] Christ and then when this Robo
[1:45:13] fletcher's dropped there's a natural
[1:45:14] body theophany a body not made with
[1:45:16] hands neither born of a woman that we go
[1:45:19] to that's at Genesis 1 remember we
[1:45:22] weren't born from the born being born
[1:45:24] from a woman is our problem Jesus wasn't
[1:45:28] born from other woman it was born from
[1:45:34] daddy the father it didn't take too it
[1:45:38] took 1 that's what brother Bram said he
[1:45:40] said born through a male you live born
[1:45:44] through a woman you die amen just
[1:45:48] paraphrasing but I'm find a quote for
[1:45:50] you then that rare party returns back
[1:45:53] and picks up the glorified body that's
[1:45:56] the reason Jesus went to hell when he
[1:45:58] died and preached to the souls that were
[1:46:00] in prison he turned right back into that
[1:46:02] theophany now listen that's the oppening
[1:46:08] is what's in you if you're born to
[1:46:10] in so you've already been to hell you
[1:46:13] don't have to go twice you only went the
[1:46:16] first time and you don't have to go back
[1:46:18] again and guess what there was enough
[1:46:19] power to get you out Jesus didn't have
[1:46:23] to struggle to get out of hell he took
[1:46:27] the keys with him
[1:46:28] Satan was struggling trying to keep
[1:46:30] their doors open second Christmas table
[1:46:34] one says observe time much because all
[1:46:35] this earthly Tabernacle we have another
[1:46:37] waiting see we have bypassed that to
[1:46:40] come straight from God the attribute
[1:46:42] right there's your answer we come
[1:46:44] straight from God the attribute to be
[1:46:50] flexed to be tempted and tested by sin
[1:46:52] like Adam did but when testing of his
[1:46:54] word is over then we are taking up to
[1:46:57] this body that was prepared for us
[1:46:59] before the foundation of the world it is
[1:47:02] the word there that we skip see we
[1:47:05] didn't come by the word Jesus came
[1:47:08] exactly by the word whatever the word
[1:47:11] said that's exactly the way he came you
[1:47:14] and I remember came from minor earthly
[1:47:17] natural parents
[1:47:18] that's why Nicodemus couldn't understand
[1:47:21] he said I gotta go get back in my own
[1:47:22] mama natural know Jesus said you gotta
[1:47:27] be born from somewhere else
[1:47:29] you got to be born from above then we
[1:47:32] are taken up to this body that was
[1:47:34] prepared prepared to bless prepared for
[1:47:37] us Bob that was a wackadoo in it it is a
[1:47:47] way Louisa's lemon it is a word that we
[1:47:50] skipped to come right around down here
[1:47:54] to be tempted and tested if we to come
[1:47:57] through that there have been no
[1:47:59] temptation right amen we denote all
[1:48:04] things that's the reason Jesus knowed
[1:48:07] all things cuz he was word before he was
[1:48:10] flesh then we become the word alright
[1:48:14] keep going
[1:48:15] what numbers that's hitting them we're
[1:48:17] almost finished
[1:48:22] here we are formed to the word image to
[1:48:27] be a partaker of the word feed on the
[1:48:30] word by being predestinated since the
[1:48:33] beginning you see that little spark of
[1:48:35] life that you had in you from the
[1:48:37] beginning now once you talk about from
[1:48:39] the beginning you'll baby birth know you
[1:48:43] got the spark you got the spark when he
[1:48:46] thought of you before the foundation of
[1:48:48] the world when you started your journey
[1:48:51] now we bring it down but when he first
[1:48:54] start listen that's why I say I like
[1:48:56] that word preserve we were preserved in
[1:48:58] God why because there was a section of
[1:49:00] God the kind of way there was a section
[1:49:04] of God that's eternal just like there
[1:49:07] was an eternal section of the book of
[1:49:09] life can't be changed it be erased out
[1:49:12] can't be transferred and then Judas was
[1:49:16] in a book in the mind of God right he
[1:49:19] was in a book in the mind of God but he
[1:49:21] was not the attribute of God he was an
[1:49:24] attribute that rejected so simple
[1:49:30] rejected it turned it down trying to
[1:49:33] hold plan down and therefore he was sent
[1:49:40] to his journey but you and I being that
[1:49:43] part of God that always was eternal I
[1:49:49] still your brother Dale this morning
[1:49:51] nice thing about see brother Brown see
[1:49:53] if we have any turn there's an eternal
[1:49:54] quality to the light why because where
[1:49:56] he took our eternal people we're
[1:49:59] supposed to have eternal Falls not
[1:50:00] carnal fall but look we have eternal
[1:50:05] representation we don't have just
[1:50:11] representation remember brother Brown
[1:50:13] said to what little woman's will had
[1:50:15] representation well if she got eternal
[1:50:17] life somewhere in her journey it had to
[1:50:18] be eternal amen so your eternal
[1:50:22] representation was what that back part
[1:50:24] of God's mind while he was thinking of
[1:50:26] his children that's it it can't change
[1:50:32] right so that part come all the way down
[1:50:35] and followed you followed you all the
[1:50:38] way down right
[1:50:40] wetting in you because God went dwelling
[1:50:42] unclean vegetable don't tell me God
[1:50:44] wasn't close because you're his child
[1:50:47] and then it didn't take some woman or
[1:50:55] man to bring that birth it took the
[1:50:58] Almighty the Almighty already had that
[1:51:02] waiting on you when you got there
[1:51:04] because that eternal thought we weren't
[1:51:07] an attribute we were the attribute and
[1:51:10] if the attribute of God if that mind of
[1:51:12] God was eternal and that part of his
[1:51:14] thought was eternal then you and I are
[1:51:17] the eternal Word of God made manifest in
[1:51:23] human flesh you say how high in the
[1:51:27] world that happened Jesus was the
[1:51:30] eternal Word of God manifested in flesh
[1:51:35] he was just before you and I weren't
[1:51:39] remember we were not people but he was
[1:51:42] he was a person before he was anything
[1:51:46] he was the logos he was way back before
[1:51:49] like brother gravity wasn't God gods an
[1:51:52] object of worship he was handle him
[1:51:54] self-existing looked around and didn't
[1:51:56] need anything but those attributes once
[1:52:00] he saw them had to be developed they had
[1:52:04] to be developed because remember
[1:52:06] everything in God the eternal thoughts
[1:52:09] of God had to keep coming had to keep
[1:52:11] coming that's why he'll not lose one
[1:52:13] there will not be one extra they'll not
[1:52:16] be one extra chapter they'll not be one
[1:52:18] taken out because remember in there it
[1:52:21] tells us listen
[1:52:27] Romans 8 rather rental quota but I'm
[1:52:29] going to read it we know that all things
[1:52:31] work together for good to them that love
[1:52:33] God to them who are a called they don't
[1:52:37] say a call Z called according to his
[1:52:41] purpose
[1:52:42] for whom he did foreknow he also did
[1:52:46] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:52:51] image of his son that he might be the
[1:52:53] firstborn among many brethren moreover
[1:52:56] whom he did predestinate them he also
[1:52:58] called and whom he called them he also
[1:53:01] justified and that justification is not
[1:53:04] baby for him because his own who he
[1:53:06] those who he justified he also glorified
[1:53:14] if you went through true justification
[1:53:17] you're going to go through true
[1:53:19] glorification hey man let's all stand
[1:53:21] our feet he loved the Lord he's done
[1:53:24] this for us we've just got to accept it
[1:53:29] start living it not just believe that we
[1:53:33] were a part of God no we are a eternal
[1:53:40] part of God right you know what people
[1:53:47] if you make us anything else you make us
[1:53:48] a second person you make us a second
[1:53:53] person if we're anything other than that
[1:53:55] and what is the second person brother
[1:53:58] Branham said he said if you got to one
[1:54:01] is who and one is who got on the devil
[1:54:06] that's only two people we didn't win so
[1:54:08] if you're a second person getting you're
[1:54:10] part of the devil right but if you're
[1:54:12] the first person of God he's the first
[1:54:15] person if you're the first person he
[1:54:17] told us would you sing a song will you
