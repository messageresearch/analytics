shining in the light of your glory a man you love him for to power as we say only home I'm little bit shining in the light of your glory for hours to power in love holy ho holy [Music] amen amen and amen I want to see him don't you good to be in the house of the Lord good to see everybody the Lord would bless us with his presence he's not turning you scriptures turn where we've been reading in first Peter 1 will just read verse 13 and then we'll be seated and we'll read go to revelation 3:14 and pick up and just cover the thought with it as we go through but we'll just read first Peter 1:13 remember now the sweetheart banquet coming up are you ready for all of that get everything together and make sure your sweethearts ready alright and then with how the fellowship meeting will be the third Saturday in March it will be in Alabama so remember the heckler just mention Lord would bless amen you notice that here we kind of move things around Richard and I did yesterday to kind of get everything where everybody can have a little more room and do things but you know we wrote a name and put it on the seat so well that way you can can find out where you supposed to be said yeah that's that's a good way to do it maybe order to do that in a church don't put one two three and you know do it any other announcements fellowship meeting remember that was trying to renounce those way ahead of time where you make all your plans and get everything ready okay father we thank you for this day in your grace Lord and thank you for everything we ask you to not to just come and be in in each one of our hearts and our lives to open our eyes as we sing unto you to your understanding that we may walk in the light of your grace we love you and we thank you and we pray that you would just have your way with all of us and let your light shine father and was infinity the understanding that you won't for us tonight because that's the main thing have you away with each one now and guide us in Jesus name good to see sister freedom back there with us first Peter 1:13 it's very familiar we've read it now what 10 times this makes so V order to know the scripture says wherefore gird up the loins cut he's already covered the old coming through into the new and how the old spoke of the new and the prophets and and all that how they spoke of these things but then the Holy Ghost first twelve would speak through the believers like Peter and all of them and joining them and bring it to the place of understanding dire and then it would point all the way to the end wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ can I say it this way at the end time because there has to be you know a final revelation in the end time right so there is an end time and there is a point to be revealed and all like that so remember those things you may be seated Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now we've been trying for some time to I know I have an odd way to try to find a thought and keep presenting it till people see it but that's just me I'm sorry I'll probably never will get changed until the change comes but I don't think we'll have to worry about it then too you will just be the same cuz I'm just trying to make a point to you to get it to you to see about the writing of the Bible now that's what we've been talking about I mentioned this ever service because I want you to think about the writing of the Bible alright the Bible as we've said writes about the past it writes about the future but what did the prophets say about the problem with that he said our problem is we look back at the past or we look at the future and fail to see what's going on at the present now I'm just as serious as I can because this is what I mean there is no now listen to the wording code I was human there's no faith in looking backward now that's that leads you helps you you know it's humanly helps in time because it does help you look what I said you know let's see this back there oh that helps you don't misunderstand it but that's not the revelation back there that you're needing to give you'll need to get what's taking place now all right so then the future don't worry about it it'll take place when it gets tired but this is the only age now so we're gonna track the lady you'll see an age and try to get this point the lady you'll see an age is a marvelous age do you realize in this age is happening something that has never happened before no no because the past has caught up with the present and the present is not looking to the future because remember what I've always said to you and you think about it this seriously think is it's a carnal way but remember tomorrow is not here all right but when you get to tomorrow that won't be tomorrow right that'll be today all right that's just simple point just think about that and keep it in your understanding of the revelation because anything present if the future has got something to look forward to yes sure and we enjoy the price yes but if we don't think about what's taking place at the present time then we're missing the whole scope go that's what your prophet said he said people look back look forward he said that was Satan's way remember ready to either the Satan's way of doing it to get us to look back look forward well we ain't got because of this and then we were gonna get over that no it don't make no difference what you ain't got because of what you don't got back behind you ain't gonna work and there is no future because once you step over your present that was the point of trying to get you to see the I am to where that was always to be present tense for eternity all right now then in doing that see as we've come through the ages it's a marvelous thing because I believe it if you think about it most people think about the Book of Revelations on how would I say it that it's not Bible you know that it's something like added parts or doing this or doing something you know it's not to just say that it's the Word of God because they want to argue over what it shows all right now that's carnal I know but just think about what I'm trying to say that if you talk to most everybody about the book of Revelation we can't understand that there's no way to understand that that's we know what symbols we know it says we know what's that but we can't understand it well no I believe since the Prophet came I thought that was what he came for was to bring those things that were not made known before to bring it into the open to her that you and I could believe it and see it all right so there shouldn't be any problems with the Book of Revelations but now you want to get in the message people and start talks coming that tells time you find out you can run in trouble because they're gonna do it I believe it says now believing is that I believe seasonally we don't have no right to believe we just accept what God says and forget to rest because it won't work all right but getting to the point Jesus Christ is the theme of the entire Bible correct all right the bride's not to theme of the entire Bible the bride is Jesus Christ made manifest in another form she's not the theme the the ending up of all things wonderful is to be in you and me right we believe that but we're not the theme of the Bible he's the theme of the Bible don't ever get to the point do you think that you're as good as your master or anything we can't do that we're human beings and we need to stay right exactly where we're at and believe in it that way and we won't get out of any any problems in all right but when we come down to seeing it see you come through and you got the Old Testament written and then you come over and you come in to the book of Acts and it was the Acts of the Holy Ghost in the people all right then from there comes the church ages and the church age has come into being you know as to describe God to mankind that was the purpose but as it comes into being now think of what I'm saying if you live back there where Paul was that you wouldn't be looking to the past you wouldn't be looking to the future cuz he tell you not to do that he's wanting you to see what's going on right then right now see then the futures got its pool the Pisces got its work but yet if we don't stand with it to work we can see present tense then your Bibles not alive to you none is that blunt enough to where we can all understand it the Bible is not alive I don't care what you say and so although Bible is alive to me I've heard people make the statement you know when brother Brennan said since the opening of the seals he said the Bible become a brand-new book you know I believe it but it was only to him at that time but I've heard a lot of people that maybe has never read a seal book maybe never studied anything on the seals but get up and say since the opening of them seals now the Bible has become a brand-new book well why have you got the same old thoughts coming out of something that it's supposed to be new right if you don't something new why don't you claim it to be new like a prophet did it opened up things and What did he say that had never been made known to mankind that's what the opening of the seals brought into manifestation was those points all right now then in the church ages see you have a marvelous thing because the first church age was Christ alive and the people right and it was present tense John wrote it over here as we were talking about John wrote it after Paul had died the age will run jointly done dwindling away before John wrote it on Patmos that don't have nothing to do with it he was writing of what had been all right now but that didn't bring in to view the rest of the book so the rest of the book was not fulfilled right now get what I'm talking about and you'll see what I'm talking about writing of the Bible see that but then when the second church age was written you know what there was somebody to make that alive somebody has made as the Prophet said the word Alive forever age and every time all right we'll see you write the first church age second church age third church age fourth fifth six and seven when you come to the seventh you hit a marvelous situation all right now we're gonna pick up to that point right d'arco that's where we left off but what did we cover in the point that we're supposed to see the Bible and we could see it especially in the church ages and that's why I asked you to read the church ages that to me will help you understand Genesis and understand how God rocks his word first now what was the point first he always shows who he is right that's the theme of the entire Bible the theme of the entire Bible is Jesus Christ right prophet said if you don't see Christ in every verse go back and read again he's because you missed it because he's the theme of the Bible all right every time ever all through the Old Testament it was God trying to reveal himself to mankind those prophets standing there speaking of the future but to them there was a lot about the future that's why we kept reading it that it was made known unto them that they were that this was not for them it was revelation they stood there and looked at things that was be into the future right I mean that the prophets coming through and saying and they they knew it was not for them they knew it was for us that they didn't minister these things and as it's bringing forth then what's it saying he was alive to them no prophet ever spoke of a God somewheres else now I'll remind you what it says in the book of Romans it says that he's not up there paraphrasing it you don't need nobody to go up and get him and bring him down he's not down here that we need to get somebody to go get him and bring him up what does the scripture say he's naívi in thy heart in your mouth right he's naughty he's in you and that way you that's the only way we talk about what will bring a rapture you said brother day what will bring a rapture when the future becomes there's got to be a change there's nowhere to go did you listen to the point I said when the future becomes present you said that's crazy because it came no no you're not listening you step over in the future it's present there is no tomorrow and you get to tomorrow it's today simple enough right I'm accused of being so deep for whatever they're trying to but you're not just it's not listening to where I say it yeah those prophets saw things in that when when naman so chariots jostling in the streets I was the only thing he could describe it but What did he say he so Buicks and Oldsmobiles running into each other with lightning you know lights on going down the road it was something real to him right back down yet it would be maybe 3000 years or something before that would ever come into being but to him it was present see if future God will help you a pice God will help you there's no healer in the future because you're not there not even talking about it there's no healer in the pi's he was back there and heal people yeah but it was present tense was the Bible say we must believe that what that he is and that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him get it out of present tense that's all I'm talking about all I'm dealing with is to try to get you and me to see what's taking place right here tonight that's how personal I'm talking that's how perfect present tense that I'm just trying to get you to see right here tonight see right here tonight the Pais and the future can come together and be the present tense of Almighty God living right here cuz there is no future and there is no past it's all present tense if I back up one day it was just yesterday but when I back up there it would be today you see that's calm if I go from one step forward it would be tomorrow but when I step there it will be today oh that's deep ain't it I mean that's just so deep we don't understand no you're not listening to what I'm saying there is no future there is no past it's all present tense what have we been stating when the past and the present and the future comes together in one point now you're gonna see a change right you're gonna see a change because that's what the change is see all right now what's now the opening of the word first as to what no matter if you old a New Testament now first it will describe God Genesis 1:1 says what in the beginning God created for rotz anything about all this other he tells you who he is is that the theme with us of the entire Bible all right what's the second part that has been in each church AG that I asked you to read them and see and we took them last week and just read them down through there and we're gonna read it in a minute and see all right first thing it'll show who he is next point he always praises the bride the shows is then he has to rebuke see first it reveals God second the praise of the bride the next is repute for getting off the word the next is bringing it right back to speak of the promise because he searched age did and then to come to the overcomer to show that promise now remember what we stated effort church age gets the full inheritance they don't just get a part of God so then the Prophet said all the proceeding and everything all will be what is it first church age was seen as this second church age looks like it sees him something know and this would be brought on over to the next over to the next what is the point this age I thought we believed that this age because of the Prophet would bring into being the complete revelation of Jesus Christ that's why we've read that from from first Peter because of what is brought to thee at the revelation of Jesus Christ now I'm not talking about a God to come I love when that prophet said it one day he said I'm not looking for him to come or saying he's coming I'm saying he's here see he lived in the world of present tense right because that's what he spoke that's easy to see that if you think about your prophet speaking in the first person is that right did the psalmist David say they pierced my hands and my feet and the things like that speaking as though he was Almighty God in what took place at Calvary see there's never God has never tried to reveal up iced and he did there's no need to worry about the future well that's what everybody wants they want the future they want to know who's gonna be President who's gonna do this who's gonna do that well what good would it be if he knowed what would it help if you knew what it was gonna be but why don't you accept what God gives that's why I told about time in the fellowship meeting they kept on about it you know oh we're we're gonna have a woman president we're gonna have a woman president and every one of them got up spoke about the woman president I got out and told them I said you want me to tell you who's gonna be the president well it's all looking I said you won't dust saith the Lord I said cause I'm gonna quote your scripture thus saith the Lord I put in Kings I take out Kings the one that God wants to be president is gonna be the president right well why can't we believe it like that and forget our own deals but are you getting the point now why did we cover how are we gonna reread I mean we're gonna read the 7th church we read the others and and used to point to show that first he tells who he is then he praises the bride then he rebukes the bride now use bride to keep people from saying church or whatever or you won't get the two confused and then the bride comes to the point of being the overcomer now read all of those to the overcomer and watch the one to this age what it is we get to it me all right so go ahead brothers if you will pull up revelation 3:14 3:13 3:13 I guess in in 13 verse 14 all right now remember we're looking for 314 remember we're looking for God telling who is we're looking for him praising the church the bride we're looking for him to be rebuking then we're looking for him to come and show what is inherited to the overcomer and when you see the overcomer of this age what the Bible says then you'll see we have inherited ever age from the Pais up we get the overcomer or the first church age we get the overcomer of the second the third one because we get the complete revelation of all things right now look what he's saying okay and unto the Angel of the Church of lady of seon's write these things saith the Amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God so now who's it it's Robyn himself with who's he described it in Genesis 1 in the beginning God created heavens near who's he describing alright and watch him now you you can't line up the seventh church age I like the way God writes things because see you can kind of take a point you can line it up for the 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 6 Church ages and they'll all kind of fall in line in the seventh you got to kind of go up and down to see because there's very little praising in the seventh Church 8 there's more rebuking in the seventh church age than any age because it's to finish it all up brother branham said in this age will be the wondrous glorious revelation of all things and how in showing where God is and what he's taking place in this age is to be revealed it shows the complete understanding of the Antichrist but it shows the complete revelation of Jesus Christ I watch that as we go through color watch what he says I know thy works remember every age gets that statement every Church age got that statement I know that works because that's not works like we try to have works to it that's a life lived by Jesus Christ in you that's the best way to say works I know that works that aren't neither cold or hot a would our work cold or hot now that's just not a false vine that's to the true vine the true vine is rebuked in each church age as well as the false fine okay come on now so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I'll spew thee out of my mouth it's gonna be done the biggest force in the world gonna be spewed out his mouth end of the tribulation listen why because I said I'm rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I'll get much praise I counsel thee to buy of me gold in the fire that thou mayst be rich and white raiment see a challenge instead of a praise a challenge that thou may us be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and not ours what I say that I may see a challenge to us cause in this age like I said the Antichrist is gonna come to his height through development or whatever as well as Jesus Christ the most deceiving age right the seventh search age the most deceiving age of all things because you can't tell who the bride is and who's not oh yeah we can't well okay that's all right but he said I counsel the in other words I charge you I plead with you cuz finally he'll get down and knocking at the door trying to get back in to his own church right look as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door knock and if man any man hear my voice and open the door I'll come in to him and will sup with him and he with me not a lot of praise in this age but a lot not a lot of bragging in this church age God a source age you all come on if you read the church ages you know what I'm saying is right you always had a pray I mean you had an opening to who God was a praise of the people a rebuke but then turning right back to showing that he never changed no part and to the overcomer of that age he gives a great revelation now let's see if we can find that all the revelation ends in this age okay to him that overcometh I'll grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and sat down with my father and his from he didn't say on this throne he said in his throne he's all we're gonna set up there on the stage with him that's nothing to me I don't care I'm honest I'll be glad to just take a back row seat no problem I don't have to be that but I want to be in his room or in other words I want is thrown in me so you see the challenge of this age to him that overcometh our grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm sitting down with my father in his strong will get to revelations for next we'll see how he goes from his throne to the Father strong we'll deal with that oh yeah he that have the ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches always the same challenge to each one but listen church what I said and I'm serious you read it there this age is the worst age of all this is the worst age that has ever been because it's the most deceiving one that has ever been it will deceive the very elect if possible no know what your prophet said but I know a lot what he said - he said now you're not no no you know you're not gonna overcome that believer he said that won't work all right but how did he come what did he come up with when he said he said frankly to get him so mixed up now do you need that one he said frankly get him all mixed up so mixed up they didn't have to cut the work short let us say it told you we'll pick up something from this church age that I hope will help us because it's the most horrible age that's ever been the Antichrist comes to his full whew Tricia nor ever how you say that wording he comes to a full point in this age this is the age of the most deception that had ever been very little praise did you read in the seventh church age not like the first church age where it's a hour you know you you hate that deeds you against them things and all like that the seventh Church age is just flowing through the age as he goes backwards and forth to praise but at the same time he's rebuking right you say yeah but brother Dale we've got the most word dogs for the problems that not the problem with the most word the problem is is what we think with God now you tell me these brothers has preached for 40 50 years brother Branham was a prophet and now they're out there turning against it now you tell me they had a revelation of Jesus Christ I'm gonna tell you up front there's something wrong with you they did not know revelation of Jesus Christ they had their own concept their own thoughts and it turned and took him away the most deceiving age that has ever been like I was trying to explain it to one brother one day and he said well that's good point so you can't fall off of a house to use it upon it that's just plain common sense well you see the Bible says they must be a falling away right why so that they that are approved may be made manifest the falling away couldn't happen in the sixties and the seventies in the eighties the people were not that close to the word see when you got into the computer age and everything you just you've got a complete rush of the word through all of the abilities and the things to come forth and don't get me wrong I've got three or four computers and you but that's what I said when they started with the computer I said this is the most damaging thing that could ever happen to the people of this message I said because they won't sit down and read they've not read the Bible they've not read the message you know they haven't listened to it and had to read it and hunt it and do all the things they just well I got a quote here I've got 15 quotes on this so what if you got one that's against you there's something wrong somewhere it's this is not one of those pile up accounts well I got 30 quotes I mean you got well I've only got three well I've got you beat that's kind of bad as that boy was it worked that time that told me he said well you in bad shape did you believe one god I said sure do he said I believe in three okay that's her business if you don't believe in three I just don't believe it I believe in one God he said then my three would build one I said we'll probably come to find that out one of these days but ain't gonna arguably the Scott I got his point his point was that he had three gods they could take care of the one but that won't work too good all right but now listen I want to make sure you don't follow don't get the wrong idea because dens truly is still the same layout in the seventh church age as all the others God revealing himself God praising those that stayed with the word God having to rebuke both true and false fine and then God bringing the people to being overcomers in this age now you think about where he says we're going he said sit with me and my throne not only throne now in my throne as I said was my father in his throne so now the same way that he climbed to that throne you know I got to see then that's the most wonderful age to think about now listen to the point because if you're sitting with him in his throne you're not paced and you're not future that was the whole point to drive down to what I'm just saying if you're sitting with him in his throne you might be able to set all the throne somewhere or do something but when you're sitting in his throne there's no way to be deceived because we know what his throne is what is he strong it's just Kingdom it's his domain it's his and he's living in each one of us do you see the point this age we get the complete revelation of Jesus Christ you agree right now by giving the complete revelation of Jesus Christ we know who is we know worried that we know what he's doing and we know how it's gonna end up in this age what a marvelous age but a marvelous point or a thought to think about this age we'll be able to sit with him and his strong like we were talking whether the brothers are there today see didn't the Bible said you know let my son sit with the one on one side one on the other Jesus said that's not for me to give you remember he said now that trial or maybe I'm paraphrasing but that trial has not been put forth yet now we get the scripture and read it they said in other words it's not come yet for an overcomer to overcome enough to be able to sit one on each side of it you get it see to sit with him in his throne I don't care if I'm way back off yeah I know you'd say the same thing they don't matter where we are there but what about somebody's gonna be chosen to sit on one side of it and somebody only called Jesus said they would know that mother she had that desire in her heart let my children sit one on one side when he said that's not given yet the Prophet said that trial had not been brought but you know out of this age will come someone who can sit with him in his throne to be able to sit with him in his throne what a wonderful opportunity what a wonderful opportunity but now here's the type of things that I look at who would he pick to sit on one side or the other the smartest not necessarily the most releve did you know not necessarily what was the incidents that have are they description the Prophet gave of when the King was going to ride triumphantly through the city what did he give he had men out there that had killed all kind of enemies that they had fought they had run their battles and everything and they were all around him and he had to pick one to sit with him and who do you he looks down to one that's down in the crowded ain't even looking up and he said sir said where'd you get all the wounds he said in a defence of you look my king he said come on up here it's not the great Revelator who's gonna sit there if you understand what I mean it's not the head knowledge and the things that we think of the message that doesn't grant us the right to sit with him beside of him it'll be granted to somebody that there'll be a part it has to be overcome I look for a quote for probably thirty years finally found some close points but brother Brennan was speaking one day and he was talking about this overcoming situation and he was talking about you know things and he said it's those that have overcome all of this stuff in this age the stuff of this age the things of this age the life the doings the temptations the trials what is it then sitting in here strum all we see that'll be Shan Shan Shan's oh that's alright I don't know problem but it might be somebody that has no idea they're going to be sitting there until the time comes cuz they don't understand what they've overcome but around said thinking of her a minute ago he said we're gonna have to overcome self living you remember that one overcome self living well none of us wants to go back to the horse and buggy little brother Gary Atkins holiday men ah I said that we've talked about that we don't want to go back to the horse and buggy we don't want to go back to the nun AC we don't want to go back to none of that and we don't have to go back to that that's the point I like we don't have to and it wouldn't make us no more religious our releve today how you would say you know great revelation doesn't come because of our our how do they call that word whether we're trying to be as low as you could be as omble as you can be that's well and good but the main thing is to see who he is that's what who that's gonna be gift to see who he is and what's going on and what he's done and it doesn't make us you know anything you don't get it all built up about how much you see cuz remember it's not in that realm is who he chooses you know God has marvelous as mark he's marvelous about his choosing I mean would we choose the things he chose what about him choosing Judas to walk with him yet knowing he would be the guy that turned him in what about this overcomer sitting in his strong now here's my point I'll try to get to then I'll bring this one little point and you know as I said this age there's not a lot of bragging it's there because he cherishes the church and dozens good about her but there's not a lot of praise about a good will the emphases in the seventh church age is the overcomer that's the emphasis that's the point of each church age right there's a final part of overcomer and what is to be but what about the last one each one of the others we can take that and read it they get a revelation of this they get a revelation of that right each church age gets a revelation of his deity right then almost say that riding it they get a revelation with the seventh church age gets the revelation of his person and sees where he's at see where he's leaving what he's doing alright and that's an odd way of saying it but to some of all I've said a great revelation doesn't do much good in the past the future to come to know all the emphases of everything and how everything fits and work fits and all that's well and good but that's not much more than reading the newspaper but it's to those people now listen to the point I'm trying to hear what makes this group of people so special what makes this seventh church age that he would choose you to live in it there's something LOX about you something he likes about you might be funny how he talks about it but it's something he likes about you cuz we were chosen for this age he done his choosing for research age he chose out a church all right he chose the people that could make the morning star come into being he chose to those that could bring forth the revelation of his name and the things and and all of each overcomer had a revelation but to this age he gives them everything from there back to here and it's none of it is paid I mean you know none of its past because there was somebody to make manifest the first church age right somebody to make manifest the second church age third fourth field see except why can't we realize who's making manifest this church age because it was wrote up 2,000 years ago they ain't gonna do it you realize that he has chosen you and me to walk in this age he's got to raise him and then to show where this aged people wind up sitting in his throne with him not in the future and not in the past I keep saying that over and over cuz that's that's my whole point a present tense God is on the guard that can do you any good heist guard won't do you any good future guard won't do you any good now come on give what I'm saying it's guard reality right now to you to let you him know who you are no don't you think about something I didn't give these to them because I just wanted to leave it the prophet of God said this day the scripture is fulfilled there they are right back in their nation this day this scripture is fulfilled the Jews in their homeland this day the scripture is fulfilled this day the scripture is fulfilled the lady you see in church age this day this scripture in Matthew 24 is fulfilled the world is in a corruption the whole thing nation against nation earthquakes diverse places great whirl winds coming down shaking the nation and so forth great disaster devil for this day this scripture is fulfilled and we found out the conditions of the world we see where the church normal normal organization denomination we see where they are we see where the nations are and we see this day these promises is fulfilled now but in this day there is to come a super royal seed of Abraham that's exactly what it'll be would be a royal bride to the royal promised son as a spoke last night it won't be a natural seed it'll be a spiritual seed there's to be a spiritual bride rise up which will be the royal seed of the royal faith of abraham's royal son used to come on the scene in the last days and the time in the place is a promise that's gift to her according to malachi for a scripture there's to rise a message that will shake the hearts of the people right back to the Apostolic fathers again there is two rides one on the scene and the power of Elijah that arrived on the scene a wilderness man that'll come out and we'll have a message that will run right straight back to the word again that's the hour that we're living in he goes then to the point and in the story he tells then he had a vision of what was it seven times eight things or some vision of all the things all of them have been fulfilled but one or two that you could think about what do you say in brother Dale I'm saying when are we gonna recognize where we're at this day all the Scriptures has been fulfilled pertaining to you and me he talking about the Israel and the laterz and they're doing some saying just what he said not like him or no thought but saying it to your thoughts and mine this day the Word of God has been brought to you and I if nothing else maybe it's in our possession you know what I mean holding the message carrying the message whatever but what about it I've read the scripture with a dozen or more evidences that we're living in the last day the generation that will see Jesus Christ returned to the earth and I say to you tonight again this day this scripture is fulfilled in your side but yet we're still looking we're still looking for the coming of the Lord why yet we've got the message the message declares him to be present not future in the past the transmission does not refer does not do it sure he tells about the pipes he tells about the future cuz all of that's involved but what's his main point when David was facing the life he put everything he had upon what God had told him and dealt with him he'd killed the bar he killed the line nothing was able to stand in his way and he said now Goliath you gonna be like they are he said this day this scripture is going to be fulfilled do you think he wanted a future god you think he wanted a pice god or he used to pastors and evidence that's fine but what was his point he said this day I'll take your head off well when he stood there he could looked and said this day this scripture is fulfilled don't you think it's about time we begin to believe this prophets message well probably I believe everything he says now I'm human but I try to be straight with you mentally we believe mentally we believe but a mental revelation won't face a giant right so remember our point this age the overcomers to be what to sit with me and my throne it's all had him sitting on the throne looking at him as Great God Jehovah but David had him present tense don't you think it's about time we begin to believe as the Prophet said I've give you many evidences of this day being the end what are you looking for I'm looking at something present tense I'm not trying to call God up from a grave I'm not trying to bring him down from somewhere in heaven Paul told us not to do that salvation doesn't come on the basis of our do it what does it come on confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that he's gonna save me one of these days that's not exactly scriptural it may sound good but in Scripture the church we're gonna have to get to a point of having God present tense because that's the only way you can say this day this scripture is fulfilled and we can look at the car that he saw we could look at all of the things of the visions that he saw and say those things took place this still has got to be a reality of something real like my wife said when we first was listening to the message maybe the first three or four messages we listening to and run around telling the things that had happened she said it like this and we were just good old Baptists you know no Holy Ghost no born-again experience she said if he's done what he says he's done he had to be a prophet well that's the best way to start this way to start is just put it all down and say well okay I'm gonna believe it but I hope you listen to what I'm talking about it's not a point that I'm just trying to get you to see something present tense is your God real then you can say this day this scripture is fulfilled you say brother Dale I received the new birth this day this scripture is fulfilled brother Dale I've come to a lot of things in the message this day this scripture is fulfilled I've seen God do a lot of things this day this scripture is fulfilled are you listening somebody has got to live this age we sure look I don't see a lot of people that's doing a pretty good job of living it right but what about me and you you see I know that I say things and and people they they turn against me but I ain't got time to listen to a bunch of garbage this thing's running out whether you like it or not there's a lot of us in this building ain't gonna make it too much longer brother duel cuz we're getting old and death is gonna take its toll you know what I told them at the fellowship meeting I said God don't come pretty quick we're gonna have fellowship meetings in the nursing home you know what we'd be doing in the nursing home what did he say he said something about me believing three cards I do too yeah that's about as much as we believe the church listen it's serious as you can be in your life is God present tense to you I know this statement ain't gonna move over too good but you know there's a lot of times I wished God was in three parts he's a brother Dale because maybe somewhere in between the three of them they'd forget about me that's what I mean by maybe they'd forget about me and what I am because they'd be dealing with each other but ain't no three gods I ain't got to worry about I gotta facing myself which this hurts why can't we say this day I have put everything I've got into this message come on you know around this message what they're doing today we don't have to throw off on nobody it's not nothing but you know where they're going and what they're going after let me see this day this scripture is fulfilled they must need to be a falling away and to be a falling away you got to be up there close so a lot of people have been closed and fell away what about a God that would allow us to be brought to a place like he is he said what brother Dale my God is too good he wouldn't let me be tempted and persecuted and tried and he wouldn't what give you that authority well then I can quote to you about millions of them that died at the martyr estates that he knew there's going to do it and he permitted it to take place so let's don't go on the basis that we're so goody-goody but do you get what I'm saying can you see that we're in the end time or are you just living a day-by-day routine of a message part are we just some other cult some other group of people that have come along or do we believe that he's real but the thing about it is you don't have to worry about because he's gonna overcome this age is gonna overcome everything Satan throws at it somebody's gonna do it this day this scripture is fulfilled among everything's being thrown that you can be thrown he's gonna try you to see whether you'll stay with the truth no I'll see if you got your little feelings heard about this or about to add or some kind of a point or whatever the thought of Jill come on musicians just think this age is the worst of all ages but it's the greatest age greatest thing time is fixing to drop into eternity now listen if you're thinking about the future you realize you've got to find out where you are you're in the present tense you said well I know brother Dale I'm know you're not in the future in present tense I want to be here because this is where God's at he's not in the future he has no reason to be there like I've always said and you know when they went to the moon I said God didn't have to go to the moon cause ain't nobody up bar you have to go judge nobody nor anything ain't nobody up bar nice plane sails let's see this day this scriptures fulfill what we're in the lady of seein age we're in the life stage of all ages that could ever be there is no eighth circuit the next you automatically go to revelations for one and the door opened inhaler we'll see that doors open right now the only way you and I gonna get into heaven is realize where we're at right now and to see this day this scripture you realize what I'm saying to the Gentile dispensation of the bride park this is finished now we got to go do the brother to that huh huh all we got to do is get him here we're not worried about going there I've never believed the rapture was going dire I wrote it down and so my notion were missing for brother Brown said the seventh church age takes the rap shot this day this scripture is fulfilled if we believe it surely we ought to believe we're in the lady will see an age surely were to believe all of the things that has happened that's in the scriptures and the things that are pointed out but when we're gonna believe that we're the people at the end of all things has come upon go see this day this scripture is fulfilled to someone we're the living manifestation of the Word of God because that's what it wasn't ever Church age that's what it was all the way through the Old Testament all the way down through the Bible then somebody making God's Word Alive well when are we gonna believe that were the people making it alive well we got brother listing this day this scripture is fulfilled for sweet creature the fire [Music] can you believe it can you believe where we're at and what we're doing [Music] this is the life stage [Music] somebody's gonna stand forth and say I believe it [Music] Happy's as we [Music] so anybody have a need this day [Music] is reality of life and happiness he has come from the Word of God to make us know who we are my brother Dale I just don't feel nothing worth that out that's lady you'll say oh I don't see none Gordo that's Lady of sales [Music] but when you really see who you are and what's taking place this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears what do you believe it [Music] are you still looking for something are we looking at it [Music] it'd only be present tense to look at it you can't see the future the pious is gone is your God living in the future no my God's not living in the past he's present tense because this is the age if this is the agency takes a rapture this is the age that pice present and eternity comes together as one time we're gonna sell out of here there won't be no pie spread in the future when we get out of this world all be over with so why can't we say this day this scripture is fulfilled brother Dale why can't we say it what have we got to worry about why are we worried why are we concerned we ought to be concerned with our lives yes with the word being revealed yes but not concerned about what the rest of the world is doing we can't change that anyway come on what did the Prophet say Oh George Washington Abraham Lincoln in every office in the country and wouldn't be able to pull it out you know we used to look at that and said I don't believe that but I think this day that order may reveal to you that it can be done now I never knew Oh Bom Oh existed until he was president and I certainly didn't know crop existed and I've earned you've earned a little about Jimmy Carter he just puts in who he won't see him it's gonna finish right man has to be in the right office everything take place why because we're living in all right what about it father I know this has been an odd way of presenting something I pray you'd break down into the hearts of the people to let us all see one thing if we're looking to the future we're messing up we looking back we're messing up this day this scripture is fulfilled we're living in it's time to word that Satan than ever hand is pull it in twisting but yet we walk with you Lord in your word and believe you forgive our sins because we know we do that we have problems and our human elements but yet we want to rest in you and if we can sit with you in your throne our Lord let that be the kingdom of God we love you and we thank you bless everybody on the way home give a safe journey let your love be with us in Jesus name wait has a little announcement to make
