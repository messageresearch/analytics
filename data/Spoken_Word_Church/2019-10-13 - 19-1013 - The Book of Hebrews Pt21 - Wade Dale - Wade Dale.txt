========================================

with us this morning he made it thank you for taking over last Sunday and we are going to continue all in Hebrews that brotherly love continue we not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares like said before if we if we could see what was going on in the other dimension and a lot more busy than this one we think we're busy angels are doing things for us and with us and helping us I love it brother Browne said when you know believer has an angel you get from birth that's your predestined there an angel it's that's that's somebody there with you know who you think well words of that sometimes when that's not your Savior it's just I don't all right remember them there in bonds as bound with them and then which suffer adversity is being yourself hopeful in the body so in other words don't disclose people and you know you say well we saw one so it's going through a hard time well you know kinda maybe enter in with them a little bit you know tell them that I'm going back to me praying for them it's good a comfort about Lancome oh right just enter in and say God whatever they going through its an adversity in if there's a child of yours and then they'll accept it we've all been through it we've all gone through it we all still going through it adversity because we're all one body of Christ you can't kick the you can't keep the baby out with the bathwater you know it old saying domain well you can't take a little baby in Christ and you just you know acting like a baby but if there's a baby if they're born again be careful you may entertain angels unaware than the entertainment may not be the good part you know so let's just be careful let's be mindful of the whole body of Christ that's booked up that's what I wanted to see and all these different things at work that we're doing now specially for the youth and different ones we need we need to we have diversity as far as adversity we have diversity in the body many different members and different parts so we need to be we need to be especially now my brother date I mean I know he don't mind me telling he said he breezed a lot of fruit during his time of trying to witness to people a lot of times you witnessed with with a joke oh you know that's the minute not good tender hands and nail scarred hands and but now there's a big difference in that and then talking to somebody's been in the message twenty years but then even have a chokehold everyone all right get their attention remember like god yes I think marriage is honorable in all and the bed undefiled but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge all right let your conversation is just will be we wrap couple son just go let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have where you guys said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee now do we really really believe that be content with such things as you have whether Bible you know the Bible comes in the Ten Commandments this is don't covet thy neighbor don't covet two things in your neighbor I'm it's nice to have a good thing tonight but don't try to compete when your neighbor and all the other stuff you know actually be them their worldly people you sure don't want to you want to just be contempt alright be content with what you got doesn't mean that you need to just sit home and not do nothing no that's not what that means you be content with what you got four he said I will never leave thee nor forsake thing so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what men shall do then to me and for all ought to know that very well while the persecution that that he went through and even to be so bold as to tell people that you'll be judged by my gospel I am sure they people hated him for that but you know what it's the truth and will be judged by all the gospel is preached to us and here in the end time we don't have an excuse we've got an open book so we've got all 66 66 books and everything else in between so we don't have an execute that's why more is given more it's required remember them which have the rule over you that's spoken unto you the Word of God they space follow considering the end of their conversation considering the end of their conversation not too little or the outcome of their what conversation or what they say they're kind of right Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever is be now carried about with divers or meaning strange doctrines what is the good thing that the heart be established with grace not with meats I feel asleep things not with food which have not profited them they have occupied therein in other words he's not talking about food there I don't think he's talking about spiritual food be not carried away with meaning strange talking for is a good thing that the heart be established with grace not with meats are not with stuff that you should eat which have not profited them that have been occupied therein and you see that in the message to light you see in different places you see that there's a lot of things going on in different places that what is it property you need to look at that consider the end of the conversation right we have an altar where I'm they have no right to eat with serve the tabernacle but the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priests percent or burned without the camp wherefore jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate and we know that he wasn't crucified in Jerusalem they took him outside the city and home to Golgotha and they crucified him there because of their share of a good stuff excuse me the offering in the Old Testament was not killed inside the Holy of Holies they knew that it was killed outside and then brought in same way with Christ he was killed outside the gate brought in to the city I mean not his body but he come back into the city when he resurrected he took away all of them I think that's what Paul's trying to tell me these beasts and all that you've got your Tabernacle kind of like what we're talking about 144,000 Paul's trying because remember he's intertwining with the Jews he's been he's been a sacrifice to God with his life you know done the sacrificing and maybe him not being a high priest but he sure depended on that high priest every year to go behind the veil and and get his sins forgiven now he was trying to tell them hey you gonna need to do that it needs to be Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he's a man we're for Jesus that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate let us dare go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach that's thinking yesterday we look at the we look at the nominal world and some of them are trying real hard but well I tell you the true gospel is just i we were at meal camp yesterday and there was this boot that had this great big sign that says do you know the Bible remember when we walked right when he handed me a car and he said it looks like you all know the Bible or something because he's no well read let's knock y'all well read in the Bible lesson I never said a word didn't Jim was there with address and you know and a lone pair that thing but I wanted to stop and say well let's talk about act 2:38 for a minute cuz he has the wrong time to do it that you don't want to bridge fruit make a scene but we have to one of my saying we are a selected people that have been called out of all that we were all caught up in denominationalism and all the different things that we come through but we've been called out of that without the camp but the reproach we have to bear is that when somebody comes and tells us about their denomination and want you to come to their church and then they want you to do this and you just kind of have to say well no you know we just use use use discretion listen it's gonna come a time the way they the separation is gonna be worse than it is meant cuz we're even see them separation in our own ranks amongst liberal family members much less spiritual family members the little family members are being run apart because of what doctrine denomination right but we have to bear his reproach and I was thinking also they talk about you know Jesus died on cross into the denominational world and if my brother Brad said they really can't they can't get him off the policies like Jesus died for our sins but when you say hold on when you say well he's now living inside of him they'll say yeah that's fine but you know you still see the smoking drinking and the apparel wearing and the doing and of this and that the other you go I don't know if he's in their mind you know your your testimony doesn't fit sure what brother Brown said your testimony doesn't fit your life you know and that's what this was we were saying back up here watch the strange doctrine be established through grace not with meats which have not profited them than have been occupied therein in other words they may have they've got a message they have a message listen the denominational people there's going to be good people in there that's going to be given eternal life but they will be foolish virgin or they will be under their own message because the bag has had a message the men that has had a message the Pentecostals had a message and they're going to be a lot of them's going to be bright because they got warning in under their opportunity but now since this has come to life the end of the conversation of this is is that Jesus is not a second person we're not praying to a second person we're not praying to a to a father that I mean to a son that has to go to the Father and it's two separate people or the Holy Ghost is another you got three ending up there speaking of that same way we've water baptism you know you could have stopped and talked to that guy about water baptism and you just made a sane mind because you've you've you've got a knowledge of the not a knowledge of the truth you've got this knowledge he has a knowledge of the truth his knowledge tells him he needs to be baptized which is good he come to a knowledge he needed to be baptized and that's what Paul's dealing with people that have come to a knowledge maybe that well I don't know if this sacrifice up here I don't know about all that and he said well you know let me tell you something let's go without the camp we got to get out of Jerusalem in other words or get out of jewelry jewelry not jewelry jewelry we got to get out of that gotta go to the temple gotta make sacrifices Jesus Christ made the sacrifice for you that's why it's so beautiful by now 144,000 when they they're gonna have to come out of the camp because they're in the camp of Israel now they're going to have to be separated outside even their own brothers probably their literal brothers when when the two prophets bring the message and they get a revelation that Jesus Christ died for them we'll see that's totally contrary to all of jewelry all of even Orthodox youth don't believe that Jesus was the Messiah they believed it was a dead person whatever but when they see that they're gonna have to come outside the camp they're gonna have to and then what are they gonna do they're gonna be killed yeah and I was thinking about this last this week coming up when we're talking about the the Daniel 70 weeks and all just remember we won't remember one thing those 144,000 are not going to go up the statue of the perfect man they're going to get born again under the justification baby form sanctification baby form and the baptism of the Holy Ghost they're not gonna have time to go up this statue for a minute and that's not for them this is for us Peter said it's for that have the divine nature of God sure you they will receive the divine nature of God methey I mean some of them may not have a year or whatever to listen but what they're going to do is they're going to come to a place where did you get those stars and that they wail and mourn away from each other because of what happened and then God's gonna burp them into the body but not as bride remember bride is this is a requirement for the bride because look this is for what this is the first thing about last week this is for the body 144,000 is not the body they're not the body of Christ this body is taken away this wild olive branch is taken away so that God can graft back in the regular olive tree but that regular olive tree is not going to take the position of Grove that the bride took so they're just going to get born again they're gonna get baby form justification they're going to know that their past sin so that's what Daniel 7 2 weeks is for make them end up sin transgression and what iniquity finished finished and finished done done with reconcile he's going to reconcile them to a position but you and I are reconciled to that position and then born because marks given the morons required this is was given Peter gave this to the Gentiles and then Paul continues on about growth development he's talking about the Gentiles because the Bible tells us that we may read a little bit later on in Daniel over in Daniel it says Daniel death of course this is to his people he said you need you're gonna go to sleep in other words you're gonna come to a place and then you're gonna go to sleep and you these other people are gonna come in 144,000 oh I'll take this up and there girl take a rapture but they're gonna have to die say under 44,000 - is they're gonna have to die we'll talk about that this afternoon they're gonna have to die give their life and then their resurrected rapture you and I have a promise that will not die that will have a body change before that for most for some and then a carrying away right mm-hmm for here we have no continuance T but we seek one to come now see that's separating I would I would see that in an angle Stephanie wait Jews have a continuance they have a city they are going to live in Jerusalem God promised them that's where he would put his name was the injury that city the very foundation of that city is going to be rebuilt for the Millennium that's for the Jews because it's for Daniel and the city if you get those two together you'll see damn seventy weeks mortgage use well this is for the people and this is for the city that's what we're talking about the specific purpose we'll go over that again that the first three is for the people when the last three is for the city very plain right that you can see that there is one week left after the rapture to finish Daniel 70 weeks not to finish the tribulation and not to finish the 1260 days but in Daniel 9 I was reading yesterday Daniel 9:24 through 27 has no half weeks in there anywhere they're full weeks seven weeks 62 and one there's no half weeks in the Bible except for the ministry of Jesus Christ and the ministry of the two witnesses that's the only half weeks that you have in there and that's inside Daniel 70 weeks but it doesn't finish Daniel 7 do you laughing about we do that about Haley just laughing [Music] their bikes my love me like that without betterment for here we have no containment stadium we know because we're just going to actually be in the Millennium I want you to know that we're going to be in a millennium just like just like you you're going to Hammond you go to the authority otra learning how I last away you're going there as a vacation and the people that are there we're gonna take care of you right I mean you go to Jamaica Jamaica and 90% of their nothing is 70% of their GNP or whatever they like we have corn and all of those stuff it's tourism so I mean they're not they're going to make sure you're you're well taken care of well that's what's gonna happen in the Millenium because we're gonna show up after they build the temple we're going to show up to be the anointing as brother Brown said in the six fold purpose the norming to the simple because the Chicago glorious wanted anointed the temple with you and I are the Shekinah glory of God it's going to be him right back revelations 19 with a bride to enter into the city to have just a vacation a thousand-year vacation we don't build nothing we're there on vacation we're just gonna sit down and eat grapes and whatever we drink we drink whatever we eat but you know we're not going to be busying ourselves but Christ is because he's got to rule the 12 tribes of Israel alright I'd like to have a picture of that Danny found carrying the diaper bag we do what we have to do and we do it no a little kids blessing okay we don't know what black people are below we have no so we have no continuance d our city is you you are the city and when we get to the future home which is way different than a millennium way different so this is a temporal place that thousand years is temporary everything in is temporary now there's gonna be eternal people in it but all that's gonna be wiped off after the white throne judgment and then there's a new city which is you and me are going to come down out of heaven settling in on that mountain that's going to be over there in the same place called truth okay if I write with that just get the two things separated future home then though see that brings us in future ohm is nothing but to the bride 144,000 then become servants they filled you whatever you want to say but all everybody else boots virgin has to live outside the city right in the Millennium it's just going to be Jesus stepped on the throne as the son of David with the twelve problems of Israel he's ruling and for a thousand years and we're just going to be there just to be happy and have fun and we're gonna be you know it's gonna be we've been in fortified bodies for a while so and there's a lot to learn to that too so we'll get to that maybe later on so we don't have a continuing city but remember the Jews do so you have to separate the two the Jews have a steady they're going to live in in the Millennium for a thousand years they're going to build back to the tabernacle they're going to build back everything that gets destroyed and then we're going to live there 22 zico 2244 B everywhere is leaking 45449 came too much on the dimensions but you have to watch where a lot of things come from the east and even the Shikata even the Shekinah glory we're going to come in brown brown so we're gonna come in for what Christ comes from through the what eastern gate yeah so we're coming through the when we come back we're gonna come back into the Eastern Eastern gate when you sing that song you know we'll about the eastern gate won money yes these from gay yami-chan horn beside the east engaged over level that's what we're going but now listen we're not going to enter in as Jews we're going to enter in as the anointing to the whole temple to the whole but they know that and we were over there on the eastern yang there say old cemetery they read somebody that's a cemetery in front of it thinking they're gonna keep God okay no he just don't like this resurrect the ball go run away they'll have to pick a bunch of those houses and all kind of stuff just surrounded that's my brother I'm said you know when it's that little place called Palestine because see this is my thought on this just room just for a moment until Israel takes over Palestine again they're really not in their homeland but Palestine is part of their and remember it's right on the border they just blobs of each other all the time comes over the Palestinians hate the Jews because that's it's one's kids and then they might be some issue of everyone I'm saying they're right there at that border because remember Israel took that in that six-day war and give it right back to will see Palestine brother have you read many times he says that city and he brings Palestine Palestine Palestine even at the end of ten two weeks I believe he's thoughts about Palestine we'll see they don't have Palestine until they occupy Palestine they're not in their homeland that's why we're still here maybe when we get ready to get out of here they'll take Palestine over again and in that'll stick of course it's going to set a lot of people angry at them but the whole world angry at them anyway right what one place do you hear so much about they said Jerusalem and the Jews and what they're doing what this is doing the neck and doing one nation is doing this one you don't hear it nobody else except that one little place you don't want to because that's where God is gonna be God said that's my city I'm gonna give this to the Jews this is your land you will have this that's why we're gonna come back in the blend but now he didn't say that to mean you me and you got from north south east and west all the way around we have the whole earth right by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name and I believe that's what you do every time you talk about thought at the time we sit down and talk about the Lord even the things that God's done for us that we're giving thanks to his name but to do good and communicate forget not I believe you remember what brother Dale reads in in Peter it talks about life and godliness you read that we've been reading it under time brother Dale have been talks about life and godliness so life general you stole my eternal life yeah your general life is controlled by your Christianity wait but now then we have a conversation that we have here but sister Johnny hasn't all right Terry Johnny has got to go back home and carry that conversation well she's not got a hundred people to talk to she's got her little whatever it is same way with us we dispersed and go to the different places and we carry that conversation with us okay by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name just like Gigi you know the guy probably didn't have anything for me but when we walked by there and he handed me that thing he needs to though I co and Bible readers will not in the Bible but we were clean-cut didn't have things hanging all over the place Jim didn't have tattoos and we have tattoos all over and there was a was a very maybe they didn't believe it that way but there was an image of godliness right there you know where we were clean-cut that's all he done he had everything he said he said I see all the Bible readers are suffered you know the by I see you've done well ran in the Bible walk all he done was handing me that I said hello Jim said hello he handed me the thing so I see yeah you understand what I'm saying so let your conversation really Brown said your conversation is your life it's not so much as your conversation sometimes we say thanks we don't keep saying but our life conversation to the world and see that's one we're set apart and that's why I don't I don't see where I said I do see where Christianity has got so lacks because if you look out in the crowd of people then you see the things that we know are not right and they go to church today consider the self Christian you know women leading saying smoking cigarettes how you coming so let's see we separate ourselves but you know what we don't do the separate God does the separate to rewire life that's why I don't agree with the ones that try to live so close to that line where you can't hardly but seeing a crowd I can take all of you and put you in a crowd and y'all pick you you can take us out why because you know what to look for there's a lot of times you go through a crowd like yesterday we saw some like Amish or Mennonite and they had a long dress and the different things oh but then you saw the other part day didn't have much at all and needed to but see you see that we'll see God separating you you're not doing the separating and we're not gonna say well they're going to hell because of that no they're going to hell because they're unbelievers so you and I could dress well here's my point we can all dress well and try to fit in but if we're not born again let's get this real quick we have not that far but to do good and communicate forget not what my point was these these virtues are not just for you being godly it's for your life if you'll take the life principle that's why I don't mind somebody like they ran again different ones Rick Warren and some of them that use the Bible to help you in life because if you'll use life principles of the Bible I'll promise you you'll do better my brother they'll said you pay your tithes every Sunday like you're supposed to and don't join God he said I'll guarantee you you'll be better in a year well you see the one thing it's just so obvious you see people struggle Kumtor times know they struggle with their money you know one thing's for sure they're not paying their high that's right you can see that I mean that but see that's what you see you see that part you don't really have to good luck you know so and it's just saying you know what does that need our money baby wants you to be a trooper giver if you you know if you even pay your time then you pay that out of our city because you think you have to that's not going step done it God says he loves a cheerful Giver all right I'd love to play my top I don't have to when Jude tells me how much time we need to pay her I tell her I'm on top of pay we don't know no that goes first if you put that first you're going to worry about the rest well that was a life lesson but to do good and to communicate forget not God Paul God through Paul is telling us to be Christian rid of our lips giving thanks to his name but do good and communicate forget not because people are watching you all right for with such sacrifices God is well pleased God's well pleased with acne if we do that didn't done shaking his head amen obey them they have the rule over you and submit yourself when they watch for your souls talking about nonprofit pastors teachers and evangelists as they must give account that they may do it with joy and not with grief brother they were gonna lead this flock out of grief I don't think he might get greed but he's not running out of grief man he's watching for yourself that we made that he may do it with joy or we may do it with joy and not with grief same way without our even I don't what we do we shouldn't do it I agree we should not have a sad countenance when we come to church some people they like it just took them I mean a tractor-trailer load of grief to get the church you know what they got a drug problem they drove their self the dirt but if you come with a cheerful heart and do it the way the Bible says then you're fine do it with joy not with grief what that is unprofitable for you he's not saying you're not a Christian he's just saying if you do it how to grief it's not profitable for you pray for us run Funplex doctor pray for us for we trust we have a good conscience and all things willing to live honestly now that's just life life and godliness in second Peter read that again if you've never read it before it talks about life and godliness this is God's image but if you'll apply this over into your life you'll have a better time pray for us when we trust we have a good conscience
