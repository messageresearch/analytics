this time that we can celebrate the fact of it being an Independence Day that we enter into and a couple of days you know to have the fact that we do have our independence still at this time to were that we can thank God for that independence and all that has made it possible to be able to to worship and feel free to up until the time we're living in what's going on okay John 1:1 father we thank you for this day in your grace thank you for all things and we just ask you to help us Lord to understand you and your waves and to try to direct our path as to see you and to walk in the light of your love remember all of those that are away from us today for the many different reasons one of the counts and the things and vacations and all and just touch each one and let your love and all be there to give them a safe journey back to us that we can all be together in you we love you and we thank you and just have your way guide us now as we read your word you come and speak to us in Jesus name Amen John 1:1 is a very familiar scripture with us says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all the things were made by him who by the word all right and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and light shyness and darkness and the darkness comprehended it not you may be seated or that is blessing to the reading of the word so we're down a lot of people are out visiting and going to counts and different things today but you know the Lord be with each and every one of them okay now we've been trying to speak on we started a little series or a thought of talking about God revealing himself or making himself known and to mankind because I believe that was the very purpose of the creation of man was the fact that God would want to reveal himself to the man that he created all right and it would take all of these years to unveil himself down to this very present hour that you and I are living to understand the one true and living God we spent a lot of time talking to to try to get everything right to where we don't believe in a Trinity and stuff like that because that's not even in the scriptures and then see you'd say well no man has seen God at any time but then the scripture says Jesus said if you've seen me he said you've seen the father well see now as those two scriptures contradictory one to the other all right now it just needs understanding and we were talking like not in the Bible study not Jordan where brother Branham said as far back as far back as the human mind can go is to go back to where it said in the beginning because that's you know even in the prophets said even in theology that's as far as I can go so you see why that I've constantly said that even the scholars and all the feathers ii go back in their thoughts is to say Elohim and they derive that as to the point of being self existing all right so then in that word Elohim we see that God was - making himself known and that's what he's been doing for all of these 6,000 years is unveiling himself to where we could understand but as far as we can go back in the human mind is to say in the beginning you know because it said in John we read in the beginning was the word it says in Genesis 1 you know in the beginning God created the heavens in error but that's as far as our human mind can comprehend but then the Prophet said we go then by revelation you know by further than just to say a beginning point because you know that would be the the place of going all right and in our studies we've talked about how that as I said God the great eternal one who covered all space-time and eternity all of the things you know that he was but he's been trying to reveal himself well he's not trying to reveal himself it's just some spirit yet we use that scripture Lee you know Scripture that God is a spirit well that's true your spirit the everybody in here is a different spirit that's just to say in a spirit part of it it's not defining each one of us have different natures ways and time because that is the point of us being spirit all right and God is the spirit but he's not to just say well he's just a spirit he just floating around we've been through that he's not at me after anything if he was just like the wind are floating around and now no form to him then he'd be a myth right in other words he'd be something you could try to think up but God is real he said well how do you know he's real are you real what would you mind reaching over and pinching yourself to see if you hurt what do you mean well that means you're real you're at least you're not dead if you can feel that within how much more real is the one who created all of this and much more real is God than what the creation is right sees in that we're trying to understand the eternal God by human words and that's hard to do it's hard to think about that before this world ever began for anything whatsoever existed that God existed alone because he was the self existing woman as your God is I've emphasized over and over how real is your God oh you want him do it you talk about him being a spirit but now Jesus said I and my father are one and he said if you sing me he said you've seen the father what well because we son always comes in the father's name right alright let's see then we know and believe that there is just one true and living God and that he's trying to reveal himself to the people that he created alright and as I said a minute ago each took six thousand years already so we see it unfolded down to where we are now we ought to be able to now think about how real God truly is and how he's not just a myth or a thought see there's people that teach it like that that God is the good thoughts you have and the devil is the bad thoughts you have well that's just that's according to who's who's on the thoughts you know that has no definition or thought to try to comprehend God we see the one who created us is trying to reveal himself to us that's his purpose that's what he was wanting to do in the beginning and man sinned and and broke away that understanding and all of these years he's been trying to restore that as I said we we talk about spirits within is that what we think God is really just a spirit we've heard that all of our lives that's been the thoughts of mankind why because that's the only thoughts mankind could have if you just say well God is the spirit well does he have any form to it just remember then the Bible said he created you in His image well kind of think we look like people what don't you think then that would be what he would look like what what are you wanting to look like you know what are your thoughts about God that's what I've encouraged you to to sit down and think or read the Word of God and study it to try to understand what easy to you it's not what he is to somebody else that's their part but what is he to you how real is your God now if we were 2,000 years ago back see then we would look and see a man walking on the earth and his name is Jesus and we know that was real well why can't we believe that that's out real he is now and if we can realize that he is now real then my points been for weeks now is to get you to see if we can realize that he's real here then you realize he was just as real before the world and you realize he'll always be real this is not going to disappear let's get up to heaven one day and when we get tired there'll be a little thing over here to represent the father and little something over here for the son a little something over here for the Holy Ghost because Jesus would be wrong when he said if you see me he said you've seen the father see then what are we going to do when we get dire well I don't know I ain't worried about that I'm just worried about getting there well I you might wind up getting in the wrong place by your thoughts you say oh that's impossible no no we know I we see mankind always tried to make something to understand God why would not he want to think about him being real that to me is the first point no matter what religion you are or what you're talking about it our denomination or thoughts or whatever if God is not real than who are we I mean are we something more greater than he has no he created us all right he brought us into being all right then we ought to want to realize how real he is the Bible calls him our Savior our healer our Father our leader our advocate he's the Rose of Sharon and lily of the valley the bright morning star the Alpha and Omega you got tons of statements made throughout the Bible to try to get us to understand him what you see that was the problem that was covering the other way then why did they kill Jesus they were looking for a messiah though they had read the word and studied the word they are today that you today is looking for the Messiah but he just didn't come to way that they saw do to come who could it would be that way today could we be trying to worship something that is really not a reality to you and I know no brother till I worship Jesus I know who he is you know like always illustrate we say oh I know the presence of God because it's sweet and it's wonderful that's true but what if he comes in correction to talk to you you might not be too sweet it might be a little Stern he might tell you to sit down and shut up right but see we think we've got it all figured out but what would happen if God walked among us right now how would you know him well we said well with we'd see him cause he looks like Hoffman true that's the point no but how would you know that that is real and not some thought of your mind or something because he Satan can give you thoughts and ideas what is it then what do you think about God how real and I keep making that statement how real is your God well we can't understand them defense what's deep about understanding God he spent six thousand years trying to get us to understand him he's appeared in many forms in many ways then he appeared in flesh see now that same God is supposed to be living in you and I by the baptism of the Holy Ghost well then why would we not believe that he's a real person you have a person that just makes it to - you're trying to get it - tangible I went to God I could get it tangible enough - we could believe it that's my goal that's my daughter's to preach God enough until we could see and know who he is what he looks like his nature his ways is doings and understand it but how would you know him the only way you could know him is whether or not he's courting - the word well what if you don't know the word - what if you don't know the word how are you going to know God now go out to the world today and ask them about God and what do they got him a God in three persons Blessed Trinity co-equals in Co eternal there's no such thing that ain't even human thinking how could you have God in three persons personality a person - personality personality individual individual two-person so that means you got three gods whatever you're saying I know I know educational got a little since these in is he just one of those persons how real is your God and what do you think about him and what he's trying to do we're trying to stay back before the foundation is why we keep reading John one and going back into God's mind enough to be able to understand him to be able to comprehend what's taking place I thought the whole purpose of the Bible was to reveal God I thought the whole purpose of life everything was to understand God and be able to fellowship with him see then as we think about it it says that in the beginning was the word as we were discussing this life not when you use that word in the beginning you're signifying a starting point of something no matter what you're dealing with oh there was a time that he wasn't married you got married your wedding and you had a beginning in your marital situation right so there's many beginnings it just simply means that you're trying to define a starting point when you say in the beginning so in the beginning was the word all right I see then what was it before it was word me do you not agree that God had thoughts do you not agree according we try to get to it after a while that all names it was to be written would be written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world we see we don't give God that credit to understand that he would know every person and ever be in this world and would be able to know their name their personalities what they are and then go further than that to know everne at that would ever be in the world and every time that and that would bat it's off you mean your God doesn't know that much then you don't believe he's infant and we were given that life star Wednesday night see then the word infinite cannot be defined in human terminologies how can you understand in human terminologies what infinite means it just means no beginning no end no connection to life nothing to control it nothing to have anything to do with it it's infinite how can we understand that but we'd have to agree God is and four there or what is your God you mean your God doesn't know all things what about our thoughts in heaven being lighter than their words on earth you know we run our mouth a lot what about what in that God would know those thoughts before the world ever becoming will you try to make God real I want him to stay a spirit I wanted to say there's something you know that I can just take about I want him to say something that's not real no I want him real I mean the old ending at least he's got the totem-pole rasa at least he won't something real any any religion as you find you know it's got some kind of an image you remember Paul on Mars Hill and he comes up and they got all of these different things to represent all of their religious beliefs and gods and then they got one setting over there there's just in case they missed you know so they've got a little thing set in our box we call it and it says the unknown God well that would be to mean that means to me you know this is just in case that there's one more left over see in India brother Christ will tell you they got like three million gods and goddesses with each one of them's got an image or a thought or an idea a concept they said in the Indian he makes a totem pole this one worships this animal this worship that animal they put that animal on a you know on a symbol point to work the tur belief and they believe their God is real but yet we religious people we just want them two steps period we don't want him as I said Wednesday are we scared of him are we scared to think that God could come down and dwell with us is it that we don't want him to come down we wanted to set spirit and like I've always said and I don't make light of nobody's religious belief but sometimes it would be a pretty good thought to have a Trinity a Father Son and Holy Ghost because somewhere in between there he might lose me and forget about all of my doings he said that's carnal that's right but it's it gets your point across don't it it would be nice some time to think that one of these three was taking care of me the word that I didn't have to answer before God as long as you keep him in the spirit realm I don't understand that that's that's my point to me to make God a spirit realm would be greater than all of the physical rooms you could make because he would be your very thought he would be everything if he's just the spirit he's just floating right but when you try to bring him down to the human looking race and we think that our little there was little God little Emmanuel laying in a cradle crying laying in a cradle do we believe that was God the Bible said it was no but see we come up with a smart aleck smaller but but who was running the world while he was laying there as a baby see we thought over what we strayed that out didn't Lee we're smart we straightened that one out who runs the world right now when he's over here over though only I do speak knows it he just spoke at one time in world's gonna run till he gets ready to stop it because that's his word do you understand what you see like holding up a papers but brother Dale I get the idea to you you believe God is real I believe he's a whole lot more real than piece of paper I've got here what about you I kind of like what the old boy said I when it comes to time of troubles you know I like a God with skin them when troubles start coming my way I don't want to try to deal with no spirit to wonder about it because it might even but if I can realize how close he is to me mean God's close to you will mark woe to scripture I'll be with you all way it doesn't say always because he ain't going to go into a sinful situation with us he's going to stay out and let us do what we're doing so it's alway it doesn't say always there he said I'll be with you always which means I'll be with you from here to there always and I'll be there when I'm needed but I look it I like that idea I like the idea of a god that's real you teach your children a spooky story of Santa Claus when you ask what he is well he's just the spirit now you got the children thinking about God just being a spirit and they can see Santa on the corner it might be like one of the guys over and Guilds with our one time he he was you know working being Santa Claus up in Gainesville and he was sitting in a little igloo you know the kids have come in and said on his knee and his little son came to to see Santa College well he walks into the igloo and he looks and he says daddy what you doing in here he seen his shoes and he knew that was his daddy he said daddy what are you doing in here well I pulled a little kid to wrestler life what do you think about what you see I'm trying to get you not to think about how real God really is that's my whole goal that's always been out my Romola that's been my goal back when I was in the badness Neverland I wanted to know about God I wasn't able to go get an education to get a scholary degree out of something so all I could do was just sit down and read God's Word I read it and I read it I read it then I heard this message and this message brought the God that I believed in I couldn't explain it I had to explain it like we taught it God in three persons Blessed Trinity but I knew better than a lot of the things that men come taught about him I knew better than that then why because the word didn't declare that you think I can quote scriptures now I could quote almost into our Bible back then because that's all I studied I didn't come into this message to learn that God in Christ are one we already knew that by the scriptures but we just didn't have the right understanding to occur it all the way well why not now you mean you don't believe God is more real today than you did 50 years ago 30 years ago 20 years ago there's something wrong way if your God is not getting more real to you it's not to understand him it's not to know all about that no it's to believe it I don't understand how a brown cow eats green rice and use white milk I don't understand that there's no mechanical situation to explain that but that don't mean I'm gonna stop drinking me up I don't care what's a brown cow or green care or blue cow or what color the callee is it don't change the milk well why are we not like that with God and our thinking see if you don't believe God is real then who come and died for your sins who died for our sins 2,000 years ago on a tree I think he must have been pretty real don't you if we'd have been dire we realize I really was because they beat him and they've done all the things and hung him on a tree why don't we believe God to be that real now then it'll do away with all of that thoughts in your mind or that God don't understand everything's taking place have you ever noticed it this is one of my happenings in my life I guess one of my pet peeves you thought you ever thought about when you're praying how you tried to explain to God just in case you don't know it Lord yes come on the minute you'll start giggling because you realize that I don't hit you in the head with it we all tried to explain to God what the problem is right and then we really can't understand when a prophet would come and say why don't you sometimes you're set down there and sit still and listen and let him talk to you but we're always trying to explain everything especially we get into any trouble with somebody or something we try to explain to the Lord why we've done that you don't do that when our Lord you know my heart and you know I didn't have any any ill feelings against that brother or sister you're trying to explain to an eternal God who knows ever thought and ever reason for doing those things and you're trying to win your peanut brain to explain to him you might be fine sometimes they sit down shut up listen listen I told you over and over I do that sometimes I'll get up and I'll pray and then I just said to her you don't ever think about communicating communicating is to people talking we talk to him all the time but we ever listened to him talk you know what he might say something to us that we think he's not even God himself talking to them but what we going to do how real is your God when he's just the spirit but he's supposed to be becoming more real to us each day of our lives the base is that we can come down to see how real God truly is and to realize that we can talk to it have you ever called the Lord up on the telephone and found out he give you a busy signal you know what I mean have you ever prayed and you talked to you prior didn't get through because maybe the Lord was tied up somewhere because if not what are you going to explain it he's never done things never busy he's never he knows the prior before you ever pray it well I still have to pray then now you're in carnality and really got it going good that you don't have to pray Jesus said one day said look at the feel of the harvest hour he was the god of the harvest right and what did he say you pray but the lord of the harvest which he was will send workers into the field you pray god loves to hear our prayers but sometimes he wants us to shut up and listen to him well I just I've never heard from God why don't you try reading his word why don't you try reading the Bible like this that that's God speaking to me you don't think about the Bible like that but that's God speaking to you well I don't know I don't know and I said now like you said a minute ago then and there's many voices and never speak contrary to the words that's how you know whether it's the voice of God or not he'll always pick a quarter word but you better know the word you don't know the word how do you know what he said come on be human with me I'd like to be with you I have set down a many a time and I have read chapter after chapter after chapter in the Bible and get up and walk away not having any thoughts or whatever that God was speaking to me in other words not getting nothing is that a better word or saying in few human mind it's not getting anything but then I've been walking around or doing something or being at work or something being just all kind of things taking place and all at once here it comes and he speaks to you like I've always told you the prophet of God I love the way I love to express it the way he said son he said a minister is nothing in the world but a gift from God to try to break Satan's spell over your eyes some of your wondering what you're going to have for dinner some of your wondering did you leave the iron on at home some of you wondered it just happen or does that happen you got all kind of thoughts what am I going to do tomorrow and we're gonna have a fourth and we're going to do this with you know what I get tickled at when I say that a lot of you grin because that's what you're doing we ever thought about the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart you ever thought about we're reading the Bible will discern out what we are no it's got to be a profit on the word comes to the profit I'm talking about reading the Bible to understand that God is speaking to you let's see what we want to do is like brother tell him I used to get tickled with him come you know like when we first started hearing of the word and he knew about and had heard about water baptism you know believe it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ instead of the Father Son and Holy Ghost that we were taught all of our lives and he said he used to read that and he'd get over to acts 2 and he said I just turned over real quick he didn't want to read out why it was condemning him he knew something was wrong what about all of the Word of God why can't we believe God is speaking to us no he was speaking to them back tyre see now that's the same thing as you said God is a spirit / benevolence some work and nothing realities to us he's just floating around he did mm-hmm he's right here he's right here with us all the time okay we believe it like you want to know what God wants to say to you why don't you read the Bible you know what you might find out he's talking to you you know there's things in the Bible if we would believe it you know it didn't change because of anything hell we were talking about it life's not on the basis and at home I think but when the Bible says says you'll be there with your offspring well you know what I read that one day and it jumped off the pages into my heart it was no longer letters on a page that just said you'll be there with your offspring it was God speaking to me and when they did I've set right there and claimed all of my children I don't care what you do I don't mean that wrong now I don't care what you do I do but you ain't gonna never get away from you need to get away from what he's called if he's called you and then I've had people to try to explain that to me sue because you know I'd say well I took that claim and I believe wait without in the world and sin and I would come right here to the pulpit and say you do what you want to he's coming the Lord has shown being wife that he's coming he's coming and then one day I walked into her and I said there's more of the story now she said what I said he's not now this is before he ever came back to the Lord I said how do you know the story I said not only wait coming back but he's going to be a minister and the pulpit with me well he didn't know it and he wouldn't like for me to told him that when I forbid my wife to tell it and we never told nobody until wait come back to the Lord and still didn't tell him I guess so tickle I fight about brother Gary Atkins you know he'd say roses elder the Lord tell you in Zion saying okay and she'll tell you when it's supposed to be or something like that we just know it wasn't comical but with just a point I told him something happen was going to happen one day he said why didn't you tell me that before I said I couldn't do I said God didn't fluence you the way it would turn out so had to let you do it treadle that way go Junie will tell you I would look at her and say he's got a hard road to hoe I said he's coming but he's got a hard road to hoe I can't help him hold the road me so why don't you claim your family like that out of a scripture then I've had people to try to explain to them and say well do you think every one of your children why would I want to leave one out what would be the purpose of leaving one out well we're human beings one of your kids might belong to the neighbor so you got your child I've had people to tell me stuff like that trying to ditch then you know just discourage me about the word when I don't give a hoot if every one of them belong to the neighbor you know what I mean the neighbor be every one of them daddy I claim them for my children why can't you claim your family that away Willie might not be mine I'd be claiming somebody else's children oh you Urschel crime why don't you believe God you know that's our problem he'll speak to us and we don't believe him well my brother Dale maybe maybe two thirds of your family will be safe he didn't tell me that so I have no right to speak that he said you'll be there with your offspring has he ever spoke to you personal well why don't you believe it what did you listen when I told you before too that it was a situation years ago and boy I was down and out and I was crying and just old man I was gonna be I had a big big old period that we called P party I was havin me a great one I was crying and praying there one Ellen I Drive out to the road and I think it was waiter Terrence wanted to then so he going on something that's going driving I'll be back and I started to Maysville and I was going down the road and I was crying out to God how bad everything was and I was telling him how rough it was I was explaining to him what was going on and about that time he stopped me and he said who do you think you are and what do you think's going on do you think your little pity party is worse and I went through for you to get you where you are I turned around I was crying more coming back up the road but it was joy in my heart to realize that he was not there with me in that trouble and he'd work it out why can't we believe God is real like that brother branham I'm not the one it made these statement he said God allow some people to see things where he's explaining to other people you've heard me over my testimony for many of the years and I've seen a lot of things happen I've had a lot of things to happen a lot of supernatural things to happen but that supernatural is not going to get you anywhere you gotta have it it's got to be real to you God has got to be real to you not real to your daddy your mama water you know he's got to be real to you he's got to be to work it's your God it's not your daddy's God I've never said my kids would be saved because they were my children I've never said that you think I did want to go no they're going to have their own salvation that's what I mean they may have a rough road and a hard time but they're going to have their own salvation some worry is going to get them it may be in the bed somewhere land flat on their back that's weight about it help this one probably back in the times and all of the kids in times you know always was healthy but then one day he was hunting mom and daddy the only day we didn't take the telephone the end of the old cabin up in the mountains we'd always take her cell phone we didn't have a landline we take her cell phone in was working on the cabinet we had up there and he comes down with symptoms of a heart attack and he's trying to find us why because he believes in our priors then he turns around and he said when the Horde I guess I can't find them coming between me and them and you anywhere between me and him Lord all right that's what God wanted that's the way he wanted to get in touch with him he wanted something real he wanted to him to real I realize how really is what about you admit I know it that some people never had great experiences of things why not take or what a little bit you got you might find out you got a whole lot when you sit down and analyze things and think about it and where you are and where he's brought you and what you're doing who took care of you and all them car wrecks and all of this that in the early or all the things around you that could have blown you to pieces and all the things that could have happened you don't ever think about how he you don't ever consider I really you don't never think about that you're eager God he's your Savior he's all and all and if he's not reeling one thing that he's not reeling in right if he's not real of this part of him being real then maybe he's not real here maybe this is just a story maybe this is a standing clothes idea maybe after all these 2000 years it's just somebody thinking good or whatever trying to make people want to act good you know if I was the ruler of America as a ruler or one part I'd want everybody in America to be Christians you know why go dr. trust all of them they'll have to worry about the rest of it they're all a bunch of crews I got problems with it what if they're all true Christians we'd have a wonderful world that's how real I think God is that's that's the point of how really is and you realize before not just a minute of the thoughts and we'll quit you realize that back before this world ever begun that God existed don't you believe it anyway whatever form you want to put it in a spook or a floater our cloud or whatever you want to make it don't you realize that God is real and that he was real before the world ever started or did he have some kind of beginning what done don't you realize that before this world ever begun we read it in Genesis I mean read it in John in the beginning was the word now that's far as you can go back because you back up to Genesis 1 and it says God created the heavens and the earth so that's as far as you can go humanly speaking well what was it before it was ordered you don't think about God before this world every begun that he knew ever not everything that would ever take place in this world he knows why you do everything you're doing never thought ever idea because he was dwelling along with this talk he hasn't spoken he's dwelling along with his thoughts that's his attributes that says he just hired to be a savior a healer or a redeemer he desired all of those things but he dwells alone but you know what once he spoke the word he'll never dwell alone again I love that I may die and go to hell I may do everything in the world but for me to realize that there's some connection of a human beings that we have that some way we are the products of what God desired for us to be we are his offspring and those thoughts are eternal God Cain how when you thought he came that one thing today and something tomorrow that's us he can't do that his thoughts are eternal and a part of him like the Prophet said it's not like a blueprint see you build a building you're going to do something house or something you go get a blueprint made up and you get everything put in place and you you do all that and then you go build a house it's not that away with God he didn't have to have no blueprint in his thoughts he knew what he's going to do is it simple that he would think about what he's going to do how may I say it and this will form for you to think about if there is a God I like to say it that way cuz I like to leave it in your lap for you to think about God not at me I'm not concerned it's already settled but if there is a God you mean to tell me you don't think that God would be capable of understanding all things then what kind of a god have you God you've got a total Pole you got something of mankind in these thoughts and ideas to try to make you an imagination in your mind to make you a better person or better this or better that or some worship idea but what about God's thoughts God's thoughts are eternal now what he thinks of is not always eternal cuz he thought of what we really thought of this he thought of that in this it comes into being but what about I don't want to stay on just add I want to see his thoughts I've always said it this way I don't want to be just a thought in his mind cuz he told you to said scary and what he would do am i right he thought of Judas Iscariot and how he would be the one to do what he done selling my house well I don't want to be just a thought in his mind when I brought it was wonderful be just think about just being a thought in God's mind that's not good enough for me that might settle it for you but he might have thought I like what brother Branham said he went into beyond the curtain of time right it saw the people but he also went to the regions of the law and saw people he saw all of you there he said now which word DC oh whoa no no no there's another that's it that's where you're gonna lose me you might have seen you definitely did we got to find out which ways thinking is I doubt what kind of a God do you serve I don't want to be what he thought of now here's the answer to it I want to be part of the thinker right do you understand the difference in being what God would think of that he would think of the world he think of the people and think he'd have to destroy me think of Hell he's got to do this he'd have to do that he would think of all of those things and how he'd blow this world apart so you do all of the different time and Judas and what he would do but what about being part of the thinker maybe that strange language to you but it just simply means why don't you think about you being part of God he gave you his own life the new birth salvation he gave you his own life right the scripture said his Christ in you the hope of glory the Bible said we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world chosen in him it didn't say chosen of him because that makes it like he's gonna pick this one and leave that one but it's chosen in him why can't we think about our salvation and our lives and and knowing that Jesus Christ come and paid the price for you and I but to know that we're part of that when it done to thinking in it that's a whole lot of difference and it being a part of what he thought of it to be a part of him to vary him himself may I quote brother branham he said God gave Moses a thought now watch him he said it ain't word yet now come on I can quote all right What did he say he said it ain't word yet he said he gave Moses to thought he said it was Moses his talk but he said then Moses poking it become words well what if he's waiting on you and I better way you know what if his come I thought we were supposed to come out to adoptions from designs you know speaking the word I thought that I thought that 50 years ago and I still think it today that I believe it but what he's waiting on you and me knowing and realizing that God is real is not all your salvation don't save you just because you know God is real salvation is when you accept Jesus Christ as your Savior and realize how really is and then when he accepts you is your salvation that's why the world is like it is so you've got a lot of confessions you've got a lot of people go to the altar I confessed my sins I believe in Jesus Christ then you see them right back in the world they made the confessions they done what they're supposed to do but they didn't continue on within when he didn't continue on God didn't have to confess they're saved we had to confess there was you know the Bible says you ever thought about this career he makes one intercession upon what now on your confession if you say you're saved God can save you but if you don't say you're safe God can't save you he can't override your free moral agents didn't make you decide that's why the scripture says that a man believers in his heart romans and confesses with his mouth the Lord Jesus Christ see then that way it can come to salvation because you've done what he said you believe it in your heart that's wonderful but when you make a confession and watch now what I'm saying toward you'll understand what it means that that he must accept you see if you don't say back to him the correctness of the word why we have to accept what you're saying did that click you understand if we don't say what he says why would he say what we say well Lord I believe you saved me because I didn't do this and I didn't do that I've been a good person well now he ain't got no welcome because all of it would be against him it's wonderful to be a good person but that's just a good neighbor but what about accepting him as your Savior but no one realizes if you don't accept him you're going to die and go to hell and miss the whole thing you might find out one of these days your word does mean a lot more once you think because if that scripture is right it says confess with the mouth not just believing in heart what I believe in you remember the story brother around told about the lady said I believe I received the Holy Ghost like not don't tell nobody now he said if you receive the Holy Ghost it's like a house on fire on a windy day and no way to put it out you ain't gonna be ashamed of it you're gonna tell everybody I like brother moat the way he said it he was you know probably rough feller I guess in his life and he got saved when he started around the neighborhood telling everybody about him getting saved well you know what they try to have him as he was they'd rather have him as he was as a sinner than to have him as it was then coming to Christ because you know why because he was going to be tempered it was he was going to condemn them he was condemning him right there because they didn't have what he had we get that time to be Christians he says something that's really hard he said I just didn't want him to talk about the Lord maybe they didn't know the Lord what about it God's talks are eternal it can never have a new thought their eternal and part of him his thoughts was before it became word he thought it and spoken it became a word maybe you need to say maybe you need to confess your salvation maybe you need to do what have you said believe in your heart that God have saved you and then confess it well I don't want to say it because the neighbors ain't gonna like it cuz I start living there doing different doing some well then don't worry about it you're not saying I'm sorry that's human yeah but you don't understand I'm saved I'm going to happen I just don't want to live too good while I'm here that's doing pretty good isn't it I've gotten why I supposed to do I've had people look right at me I'd done what God told me to do and he's got to save me now you're demanding it you're not accepting it and letting him work it out you're demanding that he do it because of what you've done that ain't gonna save you it's when you accept what he said and go confessing it the talking to sister there's one about healing the biggest portion of my healing has not been an instantaneous healing I've had that I've been delivered instantly from all kind of things you've been with me you've been there my eyesight my blood type change totally from a positive to a negative medically proven it means not something to argue I had a lot of little signs but you know what I get most of the time I'm hurting and I start saying by stripes I'm healed and every time it hurts I said by stripes I'm healed you see I don't say I'll say it when he were delivers me that's what most people say about faith they think that when you prayed for that he delivered you then you say you're healed that ain't Bible there ain't no scripture for that the scripture is you must confess before God can make it come to vice sometimes you got to just say thank you going every time that hurts that much more you say thank you Lord it hurts more and you said thank you Lord we're human beings we believe in going to doctors and taking medicines and doing things like that we're not contrary to the medical realm but I'll sit down with medical doctors many of them anytime I change doctors or whatever I do I sit down with them and explain to them one of the the doctor I'm here is that you help me I want you to give me what you can to help me and you try your best to help this old body but you ain't going to heal me or nothing because God's the only healer there is if you don't believe it that way then this let me go I'll go find me another one you know what you find some good doctors like that and you know what you'll find out they won't forget it when you go back to them they'll be yeah I know yeah we're Christians we're Christians what because they know that you're telling it lie which used to bless God I'm not going to take no medicine well why are you going to doctor pond you're going to take what it says where you going to well I need to go find out what's wrong with I know what's wrong with I mean you're hurting all over and you want to find out what's wrong we've well can go take no medicine well you won't find out what's wrong with right there's be sensible but say what God says God says your heal yes but if the Lord would ever just tell me that the Bible says by His stripes I am healed let me go say that until he knows it's a reality come on musician until he knows it's a reality in my heart and then he'll make it manifest and fall right in line it's never failed me yet so what I need to worry about anything but see we like I said we wanted to be delivered then we'll confess it I told you before about it we had services here one time years ago like Friday night Saturday night and Sunday services on time brother mode ever scared you with free services you know where I was at I'd been in the hospital you know what my back was messed up I was laying in the hospital they were trying to get me to do everything in the book they was knew they wouldn't know need talking tell anybody that doctor I said put me out of here he says I'll let you out of here if you tell me give me your word that you'll go home and rest I never would give him that cuz I knew I wouldn't go and do it he finally agreed and left me I come right here Friday night with a heating pad set in a pew with a heating pad at my back Saturday night I said in a hoot in the chair you know pew with a heap of had at my back Sunday morning and Sunday night I said here dying with pain taking pain pills yes to try to live but you don't walk long about the middle of the next week it was all gone confess yourself into it he that believeth in his baptized what it say shall be saved so it's the process right let's stand together what we got running 2400 he might have a need this is your God real there's any way to think about his thoughts is eternal so there's no need of trying to deceive him [Music] just realize that he's real whisperer [Music] Oh Emmy eats the five or by I go you know Jesus crisis you're safe is he real [Music] let's go limit into any doubts of our mind let's leave and just walk right on down the road each step I take - and I see what about it so sometimes things are going wrong you don't see any hope he's turned to him the Lord that man said you're real that Bible said you're real bleak are you coming to show me he ever filled up the line will be take each just beats me oh sure there were a fry for wine this afternoon the services you're dismissed and father we just commit everything to you believe it all as well we believe
