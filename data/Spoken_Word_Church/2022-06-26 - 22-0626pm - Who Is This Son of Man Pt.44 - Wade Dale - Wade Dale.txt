want to pray for them and look whoever wants to stay in practice song for the meeting in ohio needs to stay in the sanctuary after service that is according to sister bella and sister nyla what'd y'all get put in my hand wow put them in charge you ain't kidding they can do it no doubt all right everybody you love the lord let's get started let me read this real quick this quote this this listen to this right here now we're sitting in heavenly places in the presence of christ lifted up above the cares of the world into a realm of faith and that's what don't it's not up here it's one of the ones i'm reading that i found this morning what could happen here tonight there could be another pentecost there could be such a thing happen here tonight like it was in acts 2. christ is here if we could get the hardness of our hearts away is he with us is it true is christ in our midst he promised to be how would you know him not by the way he looked but by the works he done that's what he promised and he said he would do god help us tonight that when we leave here my prayer is that i'll just say it with my eyes open to you people i pray that you will see something so real this is brother adam in 1962 preaching to jeffersonville uh you'll see something so real that god will do something so real tonight until you will say like those from a mess that our hearts not burn within us that's power heads lord thank you for this day that you give us we love you lord we love the things that you do for your people lord we love the word of god father we pray that you would just make it more real to our heart lord that you would make us lord to be into your image mold us as we're going to read here in a minute be conformed and transformed into your image lord we're we're so as people say we're stuck down here in this worldly time but lord we're looking for a heavenly place we're looking for us now as we are sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus to our soul that the rest of us lord will be caught up lord because there's always sicknesses in the body and different things going on lord that we need prayer for that we need faith for today i believe lord if we'll listen just for a few moments to what you've said already that it'll lift our faith lord to a different level father we pray that you should be with the ones that are sick the ones that are not with us the ones on the internet father we pray that you'd be with them be the ones that are traveling brother ryan sister gabby and the kids lord keep them safe as they travel long journey lord and be with them take care of each one lord father just give us today our daily bread be with our pastor and keep him strong lord strengthen him and bless us and keep us in jesus name amen all right in the beginning was the word the word was with god and word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory as the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth now here's we're going to shift the gears here just for a minute listen to this romans 12 verse 2. this is where i kind of got the thought from and be not conformed to this world all right if you're born again you're not if you're not born again you are all right but be transformed by the renewing of your mind now remember god took the heart satan took the mind so there's something we got to overcome it's our mind if we're born again in our heart then our mind is what's going to be playing tricks on us listen your soul if it's born again does not god doesn't play tricks on you the devil's the only person that'll play trick on you amen and it comes from up here not down here okay but be transformed by the renewing of your mind look that you may prove that you may prove god puts you here to do something that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god what's the will of god his word and what are we here to do manifest the word of god for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think amen if you do the lord's going to knock you down i promise you but to think soberly according as god hath dealt this is where i got my thought according as god hath dealt to every man and woman the measure of faith measure of faith all right listen for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in christ and everyone remembers one of another having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given unto us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith now there's two things right there you got you got a measure of faith and you've got a proportion of faith what is proportion it comes from the word proportion if you have a proportion you have a a set aside none of you today had to have faith that you could get up here and preach today but me so that was my job but now when i announce someone else is going to preach then that measure of faith goes over to that person that proportion of uh well anxiety to some goes over goes over to that person but you gotta have faith when you stand up here you gotta have faith that you can get it to the people and that you what don't think highly of yourself but you believe that god can use a gift and that he can speak to you now man you may be seated so a measure of faith and a proportion of faith that's what we're going to talk about today if you listen just a little bit it'll kind of help us all because sometimes we have issues where we say well i don't know if i have faith for this and and i see these people this i was just reading a quote and i'll read some wednesday night because i'm going to do part two on wednesday wednesday night but brother brown said faith has hair on his chest big muscles hair on his chest and never should cower to the devil always should be burly he said and we'll read that but you got to remember too he said you can be burly but don't be bullish you remember i think it was not a a allen but jack cole he would if somebody had a back problem and they come up to the altar to be prayed for and they're bent over he'd just take and grab them by the shoulders and you know give them a chiropractic adjustment to build their faith whack them upside the head you know and do all these things to what to try to build their faith but brother brown said you never saw william branham do that he uh so most of the time he had that little finger and that little finger was doing this a lot of times he would pray for him but most of the time he goes sister brother what is that that's gentile we'll talk about in just a minute that's gentile faith jew faith sorry jews faith is laying out of hands you got to touch something you got to make me feel this thing come up and down me like an ice cube this ain't an ice cube faith that we're talking about for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god we got to get to into this birth again because when you get look brother brown says have faith and be born again now listen that's not the same faith as being as healing faith have faith and be born again brother brown said a prostitute can come across the pulpit come across come across the audience she's not got born again faith she's a but she believes in faith of that person and she gets her healing the prophet of god said she'd get her healing where somebody else wouldn't get their healing because what you did you're walking up going oh i i did i slided my brother i paid somebody a wrong amount of money i i sped to get to church and you're going through all these things and the prostitute just walks up and says i believe what he says and they get their healing but it's not healing for the new birth not faith for the new birth it's the healing of the body not the healing of the soul we'll talk about in just a minute brother brown said have faith and be born again that's the healing of the soul so that's a measure of faith i hope you can get through this uh terence is talking about people need to sleep to um get their beauty rest i some of y'all ought to be the beautifulest people the most beautiful people in the world preach it brother i believe will for we have not received not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but we have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry about father the spirit of self-bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children of god then heirs what is what do we get we get that faith listen everything you do we'll read in just a few minutes everything you do is built on faith everything you do is built on faith even in the natural world a lot of things but now spiritually you have to have faith in something you've never seen before you got to have faith in somebody you've never seen before you got to have faith that the words on that page are going to come alive so everything's built on faith if children than heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him what does faith tell us to do we're going to have to suffer the trying of our faith is much more precious than gold trying of our faith is more precious than all the roman catholic gold in the world your faith because you know what it does it builds your faith we don't want to ever knock down we want to build amen and man we want to build our faith sister christina and i were talking this just a few minutes ago i think she had a good idea i think what we're going to do is i want everybody before we leave to go to ohio to write down where you think you're at in the pyramid then when we get back see if you're still at that same anyway we were talking about you know idiot secret secrecies of us 40 people traveling together so i said we may have our first split by the time we get back who knows so not going to throw you under the bus i promise if children deniers heirs of god and join heirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be glorified together and we look at justification we talked about that this morning chopped off your past sins that's baby form justification we know that we have been forgiven now look you've got to have faith for that because you know what in your mind you can remember all those things that you did in your mind but in your heart if you're born again your slate is clean everybody with me you got to believe that your slate is clean god forgive me for what i did all right then we're going to move on up if we maybe by christmas we'll get into the sanctification and justification in the pyramid to where that has to happen all the time god forgive me for what i did i'm sorry i did this to my brother slate's clean slate's clean move on slate's clean keep confessing slate's clean amen then sanctification i die daily there's things that has to die away from me the unclean spirit is in my memories and conscious affection imagination and that's got to be what unclean spirit goes out amen we got to have faith though to believe it can be done you've got to have faith you can have a measure of faith to believe that this is being done your measure of faith may be different from mine we're going to look at it man what is measure it tells you what something can hold it tells you how long something is all right so we'll get to that in just a second if you'll stay awake long enough sanctification remember we're looking at that is we are talking about the unclean spirit going out of your soul that's baby form sanctification down here before you even get in the pyramid all the way down here everybody with me that's getting that unclean spirit out of your soul that old adamic nature is still tied to your spirit but in your soul is either faith that we're talking about today faith or doubt one of the two there's not an in-between all right and if you're if it's faith then it's driven out the unbelief then you come to the sanctification in the pyramid where you have to do the same thing you have to believe or have faith that you're going to go up to that through that pyramid and have faith brother brown said rapturing faith but see rapture and faith is not divine healing faith rapturing faith is not the faith to get born again with oh by the way it's all faith i know that but can you can you go with me here the holy ghost is one holy ghost when you get born again by the baptism of the holy ghost it is the same holy ghost but it's a different anointing when you get up on top of that pyramid amen it's not another it's more of it's more of so you have baby faith you have little faith and then it grows it gets bigger and bigger as brother ryan said it gets muscles and it gets bigger remember they see the what was the vision that he saw that satan was trying to beat him up you know and he kept saying boo boo devil boot devil and the devil started getting smaller and he started getting bigger that's why i said faith got hair on his chest faith is bold we'll get to that in just a second but sanctification we're talking about the sanctification of the soul to get that unclean spirit out then what does god do i've read this a hundred times i'm gonna read it again because he gives you a new spirit he does not give you the holy spirit he gives you a new spirit and you to believe that you went through justification you got to have faith that you went through sanctification listen you've got to have faith that god can do this first there's no other person in this world can wipe your sins out no one not a person not a priest not a preacher no one it's god alone that wipes your slate clean but you got to have faith in that can you can you hold on to that no like i said before can you hold on to the love of your wife no but you can display it you can display that love that you have for your wife you can display it but you cannot take it out and say here i'll give you some of this love nope can't do that but he'll give you a new spirit and what does that new spirit do let me just stop for justice what does that new spirit do that new spirit like he said before it makes you more gentle more settled down or you could he couldn't even live with you so what's he doing brother brown tells us if we dig a little deeper into sanctification that that he puts you in a religious order you're in a religious atmosphere i remember when i first got sanctified in my journey i obviously came to church at justification because that's where i had to come i had to come right here and say god forgive me and my sins i don't want to be the person i was before and i believe he did that see that was my faith in faith but now that faith has got to continue on to the birth amen all right everybody with me but during that time i got a new spirit all that other stuff that cursing and lying and stealing it all left i know it did i'm the one that lives with me but that was only sanctification and i knew that because of the teaching of this church not to stay in that condition not to stay in that well i've quit all this so i must be in the message like i told brother dale they said well you believe brother around was the prophet it was in 1968. you believe brother brown was probably yeah well you're in the message nice lie the devil the devil believes this message to a degree he sure hangs around it enough he's sitting here [Music] today that's your spirit he gives you a new spirit the thing god has to do is give you a new spirit make your nature a little more gentle i'll give you a new spirit then then he takes and put his spirit into you they're right with me that's the new birth is when he takes his part of his soul part of his eternal life part of his eternal being part of the elohim part of the creator and he puts it inside of you because you've come to a place he softens you up he's had you on the potter's wheel he's made a wonderful vessel out of it and then what does he do he puts that vessel into service clean and set aside is sanctification put in service it's when the pot's made and that he knows he's gonna put water in it but it's gotta go through a kill k-i-l-n gotta go through kills gotta be fire it's gotta be fire baptized once it's fire baptized it can hold water it can be used it's a vessel of honor the bible says because if god makes it it's always honorable if god makes it the thing that me and my wife made no that's children to make a choice but when god makes it when god gives you a new birth then he makes it honorable so whatever he puts inside of you is him not a second person of a trinity seeing you have what purified your souls souls we're talking about soul purification here all right not just a good thought as we're going to talk about in faith in just a few minutes in obeying the what the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not a corruptible seed but of incorruptible by what by the word of god which liveth in the body forever then ephesians tell us that we're being predestinated we've obtained an inheritance being predestinated now each one of us i'm going to we'll talk about in just a minute the measure of faith our measure of faith is what our measure of faith is to go to a body change now the measure of faith of lutheran wesley was not that they got a measure but it wasn't the measure of the fullness all right everybody with me on that so they didn't have to they didn't have it wasn't required that luther say okay we got to have a resurrection before rapture but i'm telling you like i said this morning we've got to have a resurrection before we have a rapture because that's our requirement and you know what if god requires it he doesn't wait and say oh i need to give him something extra because i i miss something no he equipped everything we needed in the word of god and that's why god had to send us a prophet listen this prophet helps build my faith when i listen to the word of god it helps build my faith because you know what i see somebody that believes it amen there's a little kentucky man seventh grade education that god used i believe that god sent him and i believe god spoke through him oh lord and here's the argument that you're hearing now well was it brother branham speaking or was it inspired or was it not i if it does me good it's inspired he got it if it does me good it's inspired if he says i ain't tote and all of it it's inspired okay and him also you trusted after so you put your trust in the world before that right so now you put your trust in god after that you heard the word of truth like i said before faith has got to have something that's why it's a foundation it's got to have something to draw from i can't have faith in something that like what i like to say about car wall linda we'll talk about in just a minute i have no faith for that don't put me on a tight wire 300 feet up in the air just about that big around uh-uh i ain't got faith for that but somebody does i don't have faith for all this other stuff that people do but they do that's natural faith but listen in spiritual faith though there is divisions and there is heights and different things but we all have the measure of that same faith everybody with me you have a measure i always um brother mo different ones you know he always he would build your faith he would he'd give you 10 or 15 scriptures of how god can heal you and all these different things and he builds your faith by what by giving you something by giving you the word of god and you can see different ones and they have different gifts gifts of different parts but we all have the same faith we're all looking at the same thing but there's measure of faith or a proportion and we'll get to that in just a second so he gives us the earnest of our inheritance your new birth is your earnest of your inheritance you must what the prophet of god says have faith and be born again until the redemption of the purchased possession which will be what which will be brother brown said rapturing faith enoch please god with rapture rapturing faith not just faith rapturing faith because without faith you can't please god we'll read that in just a few minutes these things have i spoken unto you john 14 being yet present with you but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name so what's the name of the holy ghost jesus christ so who you got inside of you i got the holy ghost you got jesus christ all right the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you listen that's one way that's one way that you can tell that you're heading towards something of the new birth and we're going to read in just a minute is that you'll think on these things how many times brother dale said that hundreds of thousands of times and brother louise think on these things what think on what i used to think on i'm not going to tell you what i used to think of oh y'all never did i'm just preaching to a different crowd that's i used to not think i used to not think of bible scripture thank you i kind of finally got the right crowd i didn't think on bible scripture i didn't get up in the morning saying well on sunday i'm going to go to church and i'm going to be with the saints of god and xyz i didn't think of that my conversation as the bible says was of the world because i had that nature and that drew me to that side all right but when faith comes you put your faith in the word of god not in the world and then he will bring things to your remembrance have you not been sitting just somewhere and god drop down and give you a message sisters brothers and he does not drop down and you start thinking about the things of god well you know what that's not the devil especially if he brings you something you go man what a revelation i i can't wait to write that down or i can't wait to tell somebody that that wasn't the devil that was god and he was using you as a portal to get it wrote down or to get it to where you can testify about something so he'll bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you man sometimes you get to thinking about stuff and i know we all do brother dale said it many times and you get think about you anything man if i can start preaching right now i'd save a hundred people if i could just get and then you go okay wait man i'm driving down the road and i you know this was in the age before you had something you could you know you could put it in your notes and you'd forget it by the time you got to church or you forget it by the time you got got home well you know what it wasn't for that time or god would have brought it back to what your remembrance amen but but you know what it's still in this in that computer and it's going around and around just like all that information and this computer is still in there going round and round what i put in there a year ago it's still in there going around in that hard drive and whenever i need it hit the button it'll pop right back up same way with me and you faith for the time we're going to talk about that in just a minute acts 1 verse 4 is being assembled together well let's continue on down we know what jesus said is that you shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you you shall be witnesses unto me now why would god need you've got to be born again to be a true witness because other than that what is your witness the world come on somebody the witnesses is the world if you're not born again but if you're born again and let me say this real quick because that is power mighty work we know that strength but you see the people of the world and they go to church they try to do the best they can some will try to do the best they can do but there's a piece missing somewhere you and i have that piece i don't even mean p-i-e-c-e or p-i-c-s-p-a-c-e we've got peace that we know it's that piece of the puzzle that the world does not have i'm sorry but that's that gene of god that talks to you where it doesn't talk to the world he doesn't have to talk to the world the world is not his you know what the world's ours i'm going to live on this world this is my earth my future home is going to sit on this earth when he cleans it off like he's cleaning me and you off everybody with me he told us the evidence or what would happen after being baptized with the holy ghost was that you would have the teacher come and teach you all truth but that teacher was an inside teacher not an outside teacher those who were filled with the holy ghost heard the word received it and look and lived by it see that's where the world the word the peace of the world that they're missing they say oh i believe that jesus died for my sins i believe that he's the savior and go through justification but they won't take the long hair they won't take to wear another dresses they'll get up there and sing oh just worship god i was watching this morning that same song y'all are saying in psalms 34. there was a choir singing it the one that somebody sent a link for the one at new york oh yeah i mean look at them one lady had on a set of earrings i don't know how her ears supported them i mean she'd do this and it'd be like i've seen them look like fishing lures but i never seen a lot like this there's like two ten cans on her ears but she's just not been taught i thought lord they're saying to you but they don't know who they're singing to they're singing to a piece of you they're not saying to all of you they've not given their all we give our all we don't do the things of the world because we give our all we it's not because of do's and don'ts it's not because the prophet of god said so listen we've already been through that we coming the message in the 60s it was do this don't do that and that's what the message was that was not what the message was sent for sure it was sent to clean us up amen but to clean our soul up first to get us to when we raise our hands we know who we're raising our hands to to know when we come to church we know who we're coming to church for to know that that man is the man that has an intimate relationship with us not just he died on the cross 2000 years ago and i'm connected to him sure you're connected to him by a little bit of faith but what is your faith believing what he said so if it's written in the bible amen come on those who were filled with the holy ghost heard the word received it and lived by it those who did not have the spirit heard it only as carnal men put a wrong interpretation on it and went into sin we're going to read in just a minute that god told us one time in the book of jude he said earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered that was a faith lost was a lost faith why are you going to try to get it back if you already got it it was a lost faith you know what that to me that's an end time scripture that's what the prophecy god did do to he came to restore that contention of that faith that was once delivered to what the early church water baptism correct no eternal hell one god all that that was the faith they had in the first church age but it was eroded and man got involved put a wrong interpretation on it and look what he said it did he said and it went into sin listen unbelief is sin in every age and every age is the age of the holy ghost for the true believer i say in heaven every age the evidence look the evidence was the same the evidence was the same justification saying case baptism holy ghost you had to get rid of things there was things you had to do but when you come up to martin luther drink a beer smoke pot talk about god that's all he required though it's all god required that was the faith for the time those who had the spirit the teacher heard the word and that spirit in them took the word and taught it to them and they were of the group that heard the messenger and his message and took it and lived it and that's what we're doing we're taking it and we're living it we are the living message of the hour the final voice to the final age under her messenger is the voice of the bride i didn't say that god did everybody with me all right second peter says simon peter servant apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained obtained so there's an obtaining of faith of like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and jesus our lord according to his divine power or his divine dunamis has given unto us all things that pertain unto what life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby or given unto us exceeding great precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption thank god having escaped the tribulation having escaped the white throne judgment that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith now it becomes a possession it becomes your faith add to your faith hebrews 11 verse 1 says now faith all right you need a now faith as brother joe greene preached here one time before i like that it's not just now faith is the substance he says now faith the faith you need right now is what i've been talking about and i'll be talking about a little bit more it's a measure of faith now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not even seen for by the elders obtained what they obtained a good report they didn't receive rapture in faith they obtained a good report because they weren't born again come on now none of these people listen hebrews 11 1 is what it's the hall of faith everybody with me hebrews 11 is the hall of is the hall of faith not a hall of fame a hall of faith not one of them had the new birth not one of them had what you have not one of them think about that and their faith put them in the bible through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith abel offered under god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by being dead yet speaketh by faith enoch here's one we always go to this is the only time that god talks about he really says look without faith it's impossible to please god by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him what for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god all right paul if we stay right there we're hung paul says but without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that what he is what he is god and that he is a rewarder of those that come at church every once in a while he's a rewarder of those that sneak around and wear pants and curse and do all that other stuff no it's a lie we need to stop lying to ourselves stop lying but he's a rewarder he'll reward you if you diligently seek him listen this is a fight it's a battle the picnic you'll fight listen when god told the children of israel he said that's your land did he not that's your land told him exactly where it was told him exactly where to go took them 40 years to do it kind of like us a little slow but he said this is your land but now when they walked up and they caught to the land what they have 12 spies you've heard my sermon on 10 lion preachers well 10 lion preachers 40 years around around the wilderness of sin two people said we got it what did they do they heard what god said and said we believe what god said no circumstance all the other 10 brought the circumstances in we're grasshoppers they're huge they're annex boys and they're they're they're sons of the giant so they wandered around but you know what god told them god said they steal your land you're still gonna possess these like this this land but you know what he said he didn't say he didn't say i give it to you when i fight soon as they crossed over as we were talking about several months before manasseh and all them they got their inheritance on this side but as soon as they walked in that promised land here comes the battles and here come the ones here comes manasseh and reuben and all them and they come to help and they fought battle after battle after battle after battle so don't think you're going to get into your promised land and eat those big fat grapes not until you possess the whole land all right look so you cannot be saved without faith faith is something you have to believe it's there that's really nothing else will declare but faith now i'm trying to bring faith to you so that you can be ready for the prayer line in a few minutes now faith he that cometh to god must believe that he is what he is god and he'll do exactly what he said and it's impossible to please god without faith just because carl wallenda can you know walk 200 yards 300 feet tall to me that would be a superhuman feat but god didn't care one thing about it he cared about his soul that was it he wanted that man's soul he wants you he wants your soul he loves your talent because your talent is connected to that but he wants your soul because if your soul's not born again that talent's going to the devil every time and if you say you believe god you've never seen him so then you've got to believe it by faith and if you could see him it would be no more faith see when we get into the city when we get when we meet him in the air when we go to the marriage supper we don't have to believe anymore that we're going to see jesus that's right he'll be there but we've got to have faith in the journey to believe believeth and is baptized shall be saved anything that the senses declares no more faith it's a scientific fact it's not no more faith but you have to accept him by faith he that cometh to god must believe god and faith comes by hearing the word of god you must first believe this is god's word all right now look you must first believe this is god's word that's where the world's missing it because the faith they have in is part of this the part that uh some um unregenerated preacher lion preacher told him it was okay to do this it was okay to do that then they send then god sends the prophet to tell us the divine what interpreter of the word there's doubt in the world about the word of god amen this message of the hour should take all that doubt out you say brother white all that all of it brother brown said rapturing faith that's what we're heading towards lies in the books and the tapes okay but first you got to do what the bible says yeah you got to act right talk right spit white all that other stuff they always say i don't need that what is that where'd that go you must come to god by the word [Music] and said this is your call moses the vindicated word and there he went anyway it anointed the faith that was in him 99 and it anoints us when we see that we're living in the last days to find out that all these signs that we see being taken place that spoke of in the scripture would take place in the last days all the way from heaven to the political powers and the nature of the people and the demoralization of the world and among the women and how they would do in the last days and how the men would do and how the churches would do nothing else that that message you got well look at y'all you're sitting around and you're just as dull and dry hide and and look at us we're having a revival what are you going to do and they literally literally deny that brother brown was a prophet what are you going to do what are you going to do when they say you know what i'm going to do i'm going to do like i think brother dale said if they challenged me and said come up here we're going to drink this drink this you better hold me back because i'm going to come up here if i can't stand on something if i die i'm going to die don't ever make a challenge to the bride of jesus christ god's going to come on the scene and make that thing manifest i'll promise you there will be a showdown just like janice and jamborus there'll be a showdown just like and i since the fire there's going to be a time when we're going to be required to tell and stand the ground that we're on and you know what god said don't worry i'll even put he said look god even said look if you're sin to send to the magistrates or you're sent to the court or you're sent to before brothers he said you know what he was saying hey come on don't study don't study three or four days of what you're going to say he said i'll give it to you i'll give you exactly what to say in the time you need it so let's don't worry about it like i said before this message takes a worry out of my life now if you got one foot in one foot out no he's talking about moses let's get into this just for a minute this is your call moses i'm sending you i'm going to show you my glory now look moses didn't have the new birth he was anointed by the holy ghost everybody with me he was anointed for a job abraham was anointed for a job each one was anointed for a job but you and i are not just anointed for a job we're new birth believers that are anointed for a job so we've got double anointing we can't we can't lose but we can't fake it either go down there i'll be with you he didn't even need a stick had a word the word the vindicated word listen it wasn't even wrote down a piece of paper we've got all this right here we can we can look right at it moses walked up with what i saw bush burn and a man talked to me out of that bush moses you're kind of crazy you need to going over you've been a son too long moses said you just waited a little while if you don't let my people go you're fixing to find out who i talk to look but look what it done he didn't even need a stick he had the word the vindicated word and there he went it anointed the faith that was in him and anointed the faith that was in him listen moses believed in himself at first he didn't oh no then he didn't did he got a little bit he got you know god got a little tired of this moses saying i can't even talk right god he said okay you got a brother i'm gonna talk to your brother i'm gonna talk to you you're gonna tell your brother and your brother's gonna talk to the crowd [Music] it anoints us when we see that we're living in the last days to find out that all these signs that were taking place that spoke of in the scriptures would take place in the last days all the way from heaven to the political power the nature of the people now this is 1960 what 1963. think about it today folks and the nature of the people and the demoralization of the world and among the women and how they would do in the last days and how the men would do and how the churches would do how the nations would do and how god would do and we see it all laying right here on us oh it anoints our faith it'll either anoint your faith or it'll scare you to death it moves us out in the great cycle see it separates us from other things of the world see no matter how little we are or how much a minority we are how much you're laughed at made fun of girls boys you'll be made fun of by the world because you're not conforming to the world you don't have a tattoo in every place of your body you don't have piercings where it shouldn't be or even in your ears but see the world's accepted and they've accepted it so it's going to it's acceptable practice now all right you you don't have to be you know you have to let the kid wait till they get up to five or six year old decide whether they want to be a boy or girl insanity insanity sodom and gomorrah what nothing will compare to what we got going on here but god put us here for a purpose watch this right here that's all we see it there is something within us we were predestinated to see this hour you're supposed to be here this is not a fluke you were supposed to be in this age i was praying last night sitting right there i said god thank you for putting me in this age the whole culmination of the bible is laying right here before us what isaiah spoke of is now happening what ezekiel spoke of is now happening right here is happening and there's nothing going to stop us from seeing it here god has spoken it it's already happened we see it oh how we thank god for this and then it brings out your faith when you see these things happen now look to the carnal mind when you see all this trouble happening what's the first thing you're going to do you're going to get scared to death but perfect love remember cast this out for fear we have not received the spirit of fear again into bondage listen humanly mortally we are scared because we don't know what tomorrow is we don't know about our children we don't know about this we got that and then um uh brother suresh all of you all know brother shiresh the dark brother that goes to brother uh he's an indian that goes to brother scott's church been with that company for years mates made real good money they did away with his job the other day he's out of work and his wife's got cancer yeah that's the world for you you better put your faith listen he would go crazy i would go crazy if i didn't have jesus christ because i know he said he'd take care of his own people how many times has the door been shut on you and then another door had opened it was better a better door opened up but still there's that little fear there's that little bit of fear that we don't know what to do because we got bills and we got kids growing up we got weddings to do we we've got things that's coming up but that's life don't ever be afraid of the word of god don't ever be afraid of the word of god yes what i'm saying is if you don't have the baptism of the holy ghost the first problem you have you will run away from the church you will run away from the church jim bug amen she run away from the church first little sign of trouble gone why no typos nothing inside to say hey stay here stay under this anointing stay under the water spout don't go out there in that dry land they're just going to beat you up and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is the good and the good that you may prove read that again that you may prove what do you put on this earth to do to prove god is real cause nobody else does they don't know where to find him is he number three number two number one is he a wall is he a plant is he just some uh smoky thing is he some light is he some what is he no he's god we know who he is we know where to find him and we know what he said the divine interpretation of what he said not man's interpretation be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind listen every time you read a message book every time you read the bible you are renewing in your mind and listen that's the devil's workshop too right that's the devil's playground feel it so full of god till he hates to even be in your mind feel it so full of god feel it so full of even singing listen if if a man if a boy playing a harp if a little boy playing a heart called david saul had enough sense to know that when you know what he was doing he was walking through there one day i'm sure saul was you know he didn't like david very well anyway and he would listen and he he'd stop and he said man that just soothes my soul that music when i was listening to them sing up here psalms 34 it was a lot different than that psalms 34 i heard on them on the youtube oh they were singing it and they had trained voices and they were all when they were supposed to odd ooh when they were supposed to ooh but you know what no god there but when you got children that know god they're singing to the man that they're talking about they're saying to that psalms 34 and that's what that's what um saul i'm sure he stopped one day and he said who is that who's that bring that guy in here and the bible said as david was playing songs the evil spirits went away from saul evil spirits hates good gospel music amen evil spirits do not like gospel music but you filled your mind up though with the things of god and not the things of the world so let's continue right here be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of god for i say through grace given unto me that every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than any other thing don't get a big head but to think soberly according as god has dealt to every man the measure of faith now what does measure mean it's an instrument for measuring or a vessel for receiving and determining the quantity of things everybody with me whether dry or liquid a graduated staff for measuring we we know what that is right what is a measure all right if you want to measure liquid what do you measure it by inches you want what if you want to measure liquid it's not by inches and miles and oh so there's a measure that you've got to separate everybody with me well how far is that road oh it's 13 gallons long you got the road you've got the person you've got the question being asked you just told them the wrong thing that's what happens when man gets involved with the word of god and puts his own interpretation in he says now it's 13 gallons long no it's 13 miles from here to my house now look measure of faith it's what holds volume which is what we know that it's gallons quartz hey sister june let's go downstairs and let's make a cake we're going to use four yards of of of four yards of uh flour and we're gonna use six inches of they don't work yet it's a measure but it's not what you're doing you've misplaced come on somebody you've misplaced the the word of god you've misplaced your measurement so your measurement of faith you got to know whether you want to do what is it aaron length breath height and depth is measured in what ounces yards feet and inches miles so there we've got it right now and if you want to measure gallons of milk measure it in gallons how about with me so there's a measure that we look at it must be the right measure luther and wesley they were looking at the right measure but some of their doctrines was in a different spot they were measuring it by the world that's what the world's problem is folks we measure it by the word of god totally whatever that measurement is the world says oh okay this measurement looks like a mile but we're going to call it a gallon because we don't have to cut i mean we don't we what's this cutting hair business and this going to church and what's this uh we ain't supposed to cuss we ain't supposed to drink oh a little bit of drinking water not a little bit of cussing ain't gonna hurt nothing that's the world you're being conformed to that because there's nothing to hold you you gonna go to that but if you get the right measure of faith right here luther had a measure of faith but right here it won't work pentecost had a measure of faith it won't work but listen they did have faith in the word they saw listen it wasn't they were wrong they were wrong in places but the birth of that day was the same as the birth today same new birth just shall live by faith is what luther brought under that but he couldn't measure everything so god had to come to wesley and give him a revelation that was a little bit further than the other revelation then pentecost had to be given oh well now you got to start wesley said all right look luther said luther said you know west has looked back at luther and said something about going to that pub and smoking a pie they did something wrong with that you know what that was god telling telling wesley to step up a little bit further have faith in that now our life is going to be our life natural life has got to change we got to stop that luther even said that t now he was a he was an englishman and they drank tea like we drank water he said tea doesn't have any value so don't drink it remember tea time but lutheran wesley they had what faith for the time so they had a measure of faith a proportion of faith but you and i let's continue on just a little bit everybody okay let's read the statue of perfect man now here's what we do what's the first thing have faith and be born again that's laying the foundation now like i said before that though is not faith for rapture it is part of it nobody with me on this the measure of faith is the measure of faith to be born again would be a portion remember you get a piece because what is a down payment it's a piece of the price that you purchased it with you said well with the new birth i got everything yeah you got everything you got you got doors open that were never open before but remember the prophet of god preached doors indoors he's going to step into your house and then there's more doors and some of us is a hallway full of doors that we gotta let god in you know what i gotta have faith that's why you have to have faith to go up at pyramid because when you come to virtue you got to have faith that you've got virtue you've got to have faith that you've got knowledge you've got to have faith that you've got temperance you never lose faith you never lose that foundation of faith when we leave this world it will because of rapturing faith but the whole hebrews 11 all that hall of faith got down to the very last scripture and paul said oh they without us they're not going to be made perfect perfect oh man they they they destroyed they killed the lions and they destroyed this and they they took over kingdoms and they they did all this and abel did this and and abraham did this and moses destroyed a nation bigger than the united states all this a pile of known cannot be made perfect without our faith without our faith they had a portion of faith we have the faith of god not a faith so brother brown says have faith and be born again that's laying the foundation let's go to jude 1 verse 3. beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you the common salvation that was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend earnestly contend this is not earnestly contending well these days i hope god lights a fire under your hind end like you did that king it wouldn't stand up for irenas and some of y'all are going to start for the first time in your life you're going to shout i hope that happens i hope god lights your rear end up because your head's not getting anything i promise you that well i'm sorry it happens every service you can't keep your kids awake you're gonna have to be dealt with not the kids y'all can sit all day with that phone i've never seen one of you somebody's sitting in here now doing this and i've never seen anybody go no you know why because you're interested in what's going on what's the next guy gonna say what's the next girl gonna do that's why folks i'm telling you that's why the squeeze is going to have to happen we are so loud to sin we are so laid back lazy that god's going to pull all this out from us you look at brother suresh now bless his heart that man made real good money he was you know in the six figures with at that what computer place he's working at they just walked in one day and said we're doing away with your job you better have some faith if you don't have faith you'll go crazy that's what this world's going to do you don't you don't you watch several months from now this world something's going to collapse stock market is going to collapse something's going to happen in the world they've already said that the world is already they're treating more patients for for um depression and suicidal thoughts and suicide heart lines up 300 percent even this is even after cobia and during covert it was way worse than that why nobody knows how to handle anything if you're not born again you'll not know how to handle it you'll go crazy slap crazy did you earnestly contend for the faith how many of you just i mean your claw i mean just i gotta have it i gotta have the next service i gotta have the next service i prepare myself for the next service for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints so there was a faith for the aaron that was delivered to some people and then they lost him there was a certain faith if you earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints that means you ain't got it right now we've got to get that back so there's faith that's lost not a lost faith a faith that is lost there are certain men crept in other ways this is why whoever before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly man turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness and denying the only lord god in our lord jesus christ in other words what false doctrine false doctrine will get you far away from god quicker than anything else false doctrine then you've got a faith for the time that's needed let's read this right here now the other world the other words i'm venturing out he's talking about this in perfect faith 1963. well i'll go the bible said call the elders let them anoint with all pray over i know i'll go i'll go up you say well i'm going to be healed see you're making yourself you don't watch now you're going to make yourself just worked up then when he passes through he says oh i still don't see see there you are you didn't have faith your genuine faith will do it right there i got another quote i read wednesday night brother brown said hope is good hope is what starts it hope is a long-range vision but faith is now your genuine faith will make it so real to you that look at that little woman with a blood issue i was thinking about this the other day listen to this do you know that woman for 12 years couldn't be a wife for those you older that know what happened she was having a blood issue through her in her female problems she had female problems 12 years couldn't stop the bleeding do you know she ever where she sat was unclean she could not go into congregation because she was unclean she hadn't been in church for 12 years she was getting desperate she couldn't because that's what the law said the law said if you're on your time of the month you there's certain things you can't do everywhere you sit husband can't touch her because she's unfit or she's unclean so for 12 years she finally said i've had enough i want to go to church i want to be a wife i want to be a mother there's no recording of what she was but she was a woman with an issue so she decided if i can only touch the border of his garment he don't have to pray for me he don't even have to look at me all i got to do is if i can crawl through that crowd because i'm sure there was that old pharisees going i know her and you know what that was a perfect path to jesus the crowd separated because they didn't have enough to do with an unclean woman especially the more fair season but that just that part of the reds i never thought about that that's good i i i fear she'd be fighting through but no they knew who she was for 12 years she'd been that way so those old pharisees are going i'm not touching herself but it just parted the water and here she goes right to jesus touches his garment and you know what it proved it stopped jesus turned and said who touched me and then old peter bless his heart he wasn't he wasn't born again yet he hadn't had a statue of a perfect man um sermon preached yet remember in the other part he says lord everybody's touching you what do you mean who touched me he said no there's a connection somewhere something went out of me that was different than when you just touching me in other words there was a faith that went out of this woman and a faith that went out of jesus that had connected look and when she touched it to prove that it stopped it stopped jesus turned said who touched me that perfect faith and that same perfect faith tonight will touch jesus christ just as it is then the woman came with a perfect faith for that time there's a time and god has a timing a measure now here there's a divine healing faith you know what divine healing faith is come and get prayed for and you'll get better you just keep believing john ryan brother perry was talking about last weekend john ryan it was days oh john ryan you're not going you said you can see i can see what happened getting his hair cut you know what god had finally had enough god had enough for the hounds of hell than the devil saying oh john ryan can see john ryan can see god opened his eyes that was divine healing faith now miracle faith would be that his brother brown prayed for john ryan and immediately his eyes opened see that's what we like we like miracle faith and but you know what only certain people have miracle faith that's what i'm trying to get to you but don't belittle yourself because you don't have miracle faith have divine healing faith divine healing faith you're going to get better you're going to work your way through your situations if it's by the doctor's help or by medicine help or by you changing your diet or by whatever you need to do god's get listen god give you a brain you need to use it every once in a while a human brain i like what brother brady said he said god give you five senses you need to use them but miracle faith is divine i mean it's like this it's miracle divine healing pray for him you keep going you know what god is testing your faith miracle faith has nothing to do with your faith in long-term range but our long-range faith means that the next time something comes up we know that we're going to be healed but we may have to walk a few days we may walk a few months we may walk 12 years but there's going to come a time when your faith is going to connect to something how many times have you been sitting here and you were sick i know sister gayle a couple of times sitting there in her back killing her couldn't even get up and she just i i think i was preaching one time maybe brother dale another time she told me after the service she said i couldn't move she said i just said i believe what that man says and boom it left you know what that's that resounding thing ain't nothing but the truth that went out into eternity and got two souls not two soul doctrine it got the souls of hattie wright's two sons that ain't nothing but the truth then we're gonna have to have another measure of faith resurrection faith it's never been before jesus was the only one that had it i'm talking about permanent resurrection i ain't talking about just praying for the sick and they resurrect i'm this is the resurrection of the dead in christ that's coming folks that's what we got to have we got to have faith that death will be destroyed in what we believe in this message of the hour it will not be destroyed by a denominational idea so you can count them out i'm sorry they could be good foolish virgins they could be given eternal life that's fine but there's a requirement that me and you come to a place that when we we look now how many of you look at those graves and say you go by a graveyard it makes me feel bad you don't even think about that some of you do blame them think about grave i look at the graves i said man there's people in there we just cut grass me and jacob did at a place and i thought they were really old graves and i thought you know what lord if they were born again under that era not not the prophet of the hour or the message of the hour but born again under their time i said they're laying there but their souls in the sixth dimension and one day one day it doesn't matter if you can pile listen satan can pile six feet of dirt or six thousand feet of dirt on top of you i don't care you're coming out they died though but they died with faith believing there was somebody is going to be alive and remain until the coming of the lord if they're good christians they read their bible and they read in thessalonians that we which are alive and remain shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep for what the trumpet of god's sound didn't cross your eyes first resurrection faith and now rapturing faith brother brown said enoch please god with rapturing faith please god with rapturing faith that's what when you got to do we got to please god listen to this real quick god's commission moses 1953. i have a great faith to believe that one day before the coming of the lord that our little differences will be settled sometimes that might be a little unbelievable but it's not we will god may have to let communism sweep us together but something will take place that'll make us all one heart and one accord now if you take those and put them all together that talks about the squeeze everybody with me that's the brother i'm talking about the squeeze he's calling it communism but then what communism and what that is not by name not that russia is going to come over here and take us over i mean they will later on but not when we're here if we can't have faith now for healing how are we going to have rapturing faith we've got to have faith for the little things first divine healing miracle healing faith to be born again first then a measure of faith is going to be put on top of that it's going to give you a place to where you can pray and things will happen to where you can speak the word and things will happen that's a measure of faith that we're coming to and listen don't measure somebody else and he writes food millions of people had he right food millions of preachers oh you got to have a shirt on you got to have a town you got to be in the pulpit you got a heavy bible open you got to say the word of god you got to say the name of god she was doing her dishes and she probably her hair was all messed up she owned an apron she said brother i'm laying nothing but the truth god pulled back the curtains and he didn't say what did you say he heard her that ain't nothing but the truth simple faith for what have faith and be born again then you add to that faith different things now watch this that's where i want to get to and then we'll close jesus had perfect faith remember he was perfect faith jesus had perfect faith he had it and it came it come because he was the word what i just read you the first scripture we read and in the beginning was word words with god the word was god and the word was made flesh and me and you and you become the word you become the word as you receive the word so he's putting us and jesus right there together with that perfect faith he's oh if you if we've got perfect faith then we got you start putting adding your junk to it whatever you want to add i can't do this i didn't do that i can't do this this ain't happening to me that ain't happening to me jesus walked in the world of perfect faith but did that stop the problems from coming did that stop the heartaches from coming then it starts the isolation stop the isolation no they hated him they called him everything about god the devil's one of the only ones smart enough to call him god but you become the word as you receive the word if you abide in me and my words in you my word switch this word abides in you that that's what you will need to be done if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe in what you've said then you shall have what you said when you pray believe that you receive what you asked for and you shall have it time space nothing else will ever change it you know it's done it's already over with perfect faith 1963 but jesus lived in a world that no one knowed about he was an odd person he lived in a world of perfect faith in the perfect god in which he was if we lived in a perfect faith of a christian to what we are we'd be a mystic to the world the people wouldn't understand you you'd walk in the spirit a lot of us walk in the spirit all right but it's not the holy spirit what the spirit said you would do what it forbid you would not do then the people began to say you know your mystic person to them that's the way it is with all believers they're a mystic the people don't understand because they live in a world to themselves jesus lived in a world that no one else could touch the disciples couldn't understand him when he spoke to them they say uh you're talking riddles we don't understand this how can this be see they wasn't in the world that he lived in see they couldn't know why they weren't born again now he couldn't say that after pentecost after the 120 in the upper room got the new birth jesus couldn't say that again they did understand what he was talking about hey they didn't have 1100 sermons to prove who he was they didn't even have stuff written down they just listened to what jesus said and they kept that in their heart and in their in their mind and god brought it back to their remembrance so now when a man lives by faith and walks by faith look i mean substance faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in christ there now you're getting into bride material you know what we're here for i'm here to get into bride material you're getting into rapturing condition now that means for each one of us not just a pastor deacon trustee thank you brother branham that means for the laity every individual walks in a world with god alone you're baptized into this kingdom there's nobody in there but you and god see he gives the orders and you do about half of them you he gives the orders and you pack them out whatever he says there's not a shadow of doubt nowhere you walk right on if the lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it you go right on just the same now you're coming into perfect faith perfect perfect perfection that cannot fail that faith never fails yes he was a mystic to them with his perfect faith and so it is now with those who have perfect faith are a mystic to others perfect faith 1963 notice now another perfect faith look is a master of all circumstances that's where he got the what's where he got the quote that jesus walked in the world of perfect faith show me one place in the four gospels that jesus was ever frustrated didn't know what to me didn't know what his next move was didn't know what to say and said oops i didn't mean that i i didn't mean to say that no he knew who he was and he walked in such a world of perfect faith he mastered every circumstance listen when they came into pharisees they were smart they were smart in the word too they were smart in that old testament they could tell you everything about the old testament but they come up jesus said if this woman her husband dies and she marries the seven other sons and they die and they all die and they come up in their resurrections whose wife is jesus said wasn't so from the beginning took him all the way back to adam they knew what the fall was they knew it wasn't apples and oranges and peaches and all the other junk they knew what it was so he mastered and remember there was one time they asked him a question he said all right answer me this he said john's baptism was it a man or was it of god boy he put he was checkmate on that one there was no other move they could make so what did the bible say they didn't say nothing they were pretty smart by not saying anything because they got together and said okay if we say it was of john then he's got disciples here we might get stoned and said well if it was heaven why don't you believe john amen jesus said well neither i'm going i'm not going to answer your question either because that was a dumb question that you asked but you know what he done he mastered all circumstances that's what you and i are going to come to i believe we're going to come to where we master all circumstances listen we make mistakes every day humanly we make mistakes but when it comes to the word of god we shouldn't be making as many mistakes as we used to make everybody with me on that we shouldn't make as many mistakes as we used to make we should be led by the spirit of god not by that other spirit look it masters it now just watch when you believe anything do anything you got faith in what you're doing no matter what the circumstance is that don't have one thing to do with it see it masters that circumstance if it's in a room of sickness and the lord revealed that this certain thing is going to happen you just speak it and go on spindle north carolina right off the road where brother joe green is this is where brother henry green got started following the message when brother brown came to town there in spindale 1956. see your faith is not what you feel your faith is what you believe if you really believe it i don't care how you feel you never never say you wasn't healed you'd always believe it that's what does it see that's what happens here at the platform when i have healing services hundreds of people that way hundreds he said listen to me hundreds of people do this right here they come to the platform and say oh brother branham i got all faith if it was ink it wouldn't dot and i oh brother branham don't talk like that well he's telling the truth he's trying to get him to build their face not on emotion or not on worked up something pinned up but look watch this right here see you've got hope instead of faith faith is positive there's no nothing can move it it's positive no matter how sick you get how everything went nothing now if you're trying to bluff it it won't take bluffing the devil he's a bluff itself so you can't bluff a bluffer and he knows how to run a bluff but when you get the goods oh brother tom fall bush that's what he always said he said brother sam's got the goods because dale's got the goods well brother tom had the goods too if you're born again you got the goods it don't take loud hollering oh here we go here's our feelings going to get hurt it don't take loud hollering it don't take stomping and screaming it takes faith he will recognize it don't worry just say the word first seal 1963 listen and when there's coming forth seven mysterious thunders it's not even written at all that's right and i believe that those through those seven thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing faith everybody with me what is the seven thunders it's the revelation contained in the seals we've had that we know that we know it's not seven men we know it's not some mysterious tutu to do or a thunder going off it's a word of god to me in you it's something for you because what we got right now we wouldn't be able to do it there's something we've got to step farther this is the prophet of god we can't have enough faith for divine healing hardly we've got to have enough faith to be changed in a moment and be swept out of this earth and we'll find out after a while the lord willing find where it's written he's fixing to open the seals and show us what was in the book statue of perfect man will be done in just a second notice you must be born again and when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith that's right so you see on my chart here i got the very foundation faith and it's right here behind me faith is the foundation of all of it for without faith it is impossible to please god he that cometh to god must believe that he is what is god and a rewarder of those that diligently seek him see he must be and wherein you're a skeptic of the bible that's what happened we have a lot of skeptics and we're skeptics sometimes when we don't believe the bible when you're skeptic of the word being right you might just as well stay back until first you believe it what is sin unbelief there's only two elements that control the human being that's either doubt or faith one or the other you're possessed oh brother branham you're gonna be possessed the two ghosts the holy ghost and the wrong ghost you're possessed of one that dominates your life just depends on how much faith you have is how high you can rise but first it's got to be faith let me stay on that foundation for a while now faith is what you must believe faith is what the substance of things hoped for it's you already have it when you have faith because it's revealed in faith faith is the substance of things hoped for hebrews 11 the evidence what is it what kind of an evidence all the evidence all the evidence got it all right listen to this owensboro kentucky faith knows no defeat faith is perfect faith brings things when there is no things to be brought faith creates faith takes doubt away takes negative and makes positive how beautiful the whole man had a basis for faith faith is not mythical something mentally worked up is an absolute fundamental result that happens in a person's heart what a measure your measure of faith when faith is appropriated given out then it's something in the person's heart but it can't be based on well go touch a tree and you'll get well pray to the post it's got to have a foundation now here it is i want you to get it how much more foundation could you place your faith on any level than the word of god what more could you put faith in when he said heaven and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away see that's what we lose faith we lose faith in the word of god and and as i continue on and i i keep there's only two more left and it will be done i you think that we harp you know brother dale myself and all the ministers we harp on things but we're just reading the bible and i know and i'm not throwing it out there when i told you i said if you don't come to church or don't want to come to church you're not born again the bible says that i can read it to you these things we can read we can read in the bible it's not it's not a doctrine outside of the bible when we're told to do things in the bible and we reject it that makes us word rejecters and word rejecters go to hell what the prophet said listen try to live every word you can make an effort diligently contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints listen the faith that was once delivered to the saints is that faith of the fathers that puts this you in this pyramid then there's a rapturing faith that we've got to come to so it's got to be another measure of faith put on top of that faith everybody with me faith does the rest of it look that's a perfect man faith does the rest so you must have faith for a foundation all christianity look all that you are when you go home today and go to your house if you're a christian it's based on faith it's based on faith that i told you the truth today and you're going to build on that or that another brother or that you listen to a tape or that you talk to somebody and it builds your faith all you are all you ever will be is based upon faith in the word that's the reason i believe the word all right look at your perfect man 1963 again 62 first you must be born again then when you're born again you have faith you believe the word until you're born again you'll argue against it what excuses excuses i don't know the rest of the song but them two words is enough for me to stop that's why i look when you're asked questions yes or no answers is the best answers to give if you're not doing something right just say nope not do anything right don't try to justify or say but but you don't understand oh come on people good grief you're arguing against the word of god you're not arguing against me that's why that when i have to deal with something it don't bother me one bit i'm just telling you what god said i'm not giving you my opinion because i like white you all need to wear white it is in the bible you need to wear white robes but that's not right it's not that i like to hunt and you don't so therefore you have no faith but if i tell you by the word of god that you don't believe the word of god because you don't come to church you still cut your hair you still put on makeup you still curse you still do that's what god said the word said that you're not filthy because i said you're filthy you felt because the bible says you're filthy but if you'll have faith and be born again it'll take that part out all right then if you're just religiously inclined that's our problem in this message we have a bunch of religious idiots i'm born again because i read the message or and this what gets me is i'm going to say it anyway if i were to call brother donnie reagan and he'll i'll tell him if he didn't see it if i called brother donald reagan i said brother i need you to come preach the service for her this place will be packed y'all wouldn't miss a service two p you'd come to both services and you'd want three brother biscuit oh we'd have to get a big haul for him what about samuel dale what about aaron roberts i mean i can't stand it in this message i'm sorry i'm get wait a minute get up on the box aaron you give me you left that same box right here i'm up on it now they have the same people in the same cycle preaching the same thing all the time erin you some of these brothers has got some sense [Applause] and i don't say they don't have sense what i'm saying is is you got your favorites and everybody does we all have our favorites we do i mean come on but you can't make it to where i'm well i'm not going to come to church until it's communion sunday and then i'll come and then i hope that i hope brother aaron's preaching because i don't want to hear that other brother or i won't i won't recover when brother bob is preaching on wednesday night i will fill the house up but when brother louise preaches them i think i'll just stay home and oh i still read the bible religiously inclined if you're just religiously i'm sorry i didn't mean to get on that but i did and you got a little human knowledge that you could should do right you'll never be able to agree i just want to agree on the word of god i don't care whether you agree on me or not i want to be agreeable to the word of god and i want to be agreeable to me amen you'll never do it you've got to be born again and born again it produces faith all right then after you get faith that's right here f-a-i-t-h he's pointing right down there then you're just in position of growing just in position of growing now a lot of people go up to the altar and pray and say lord forgive me and a great experience of sanctification that's what our problem is we stay there we think that's the new birth i'm just reading what the prophet said if you deny it you're denying him so you'll be a word rejecter and i don't told you where these people go and a great experience of sanctification come upon them and things and then you have a great time get up to the altar shouting you go back say bless god i got it no you just started to a place where you can grow you ain't done nothing yet kentucky english i love it i can understand what he's saying you ain't done nothing yet see the only thing you've done is just lay the foundation now you're going to build a house and you pour the foundation and say boy i got her see you got the foundation to build your house on now you got to build a house now there's where the thing comes in this morning we're going to talk about now all right a house this foundation is first what is the foundation of christianity faith in the word of god listen we got to have faith in the word of god everything else is shifting sands even man's ideas then you start you begin to add to this foundation so we've come to this is the last quote virtue must be in us until we get virtue then when we get true virtue we can add it to our faith that's the next foundation wall so look you can't have virtue and not have faith because you add that to your faith if you're not born again forget adding virtue to anything you just have human virtue but when you have faith you take faith jesus walked in the world of perfect faith what did that sister do she had faith in what he was she might have not even understood he was god she just knew by listening to reports that wherever that man was people got up and walked people got up and could see people got up out of their deathbed that's all she knew that was faith for the time get me to that man don't i don't even want him to look at me i'm not worthy i've been for 12 years i've been unclean but just let me touch his garment let me just touch his garment and i don't think she pulled on it either she said touch and when she touched it you know jesus was walking down through the crowd you know how if he got on a gown that thing's just going everywhere so there's no reason for him to say now if she would have grabbed it and jerked him backwards he'd have said who touched me but he just kept going on and finally he stopped and turned around he said who touched me that's when peter was like lord there's hundreds of people here no she pulled on his face she pulled on his face the garment was there that's why i believe that's where you take that scripture put it with paul's scripture that they took cloths off of paul that's where we get prayer cloths prayer cloth because it came from the hymn of the garment of jesus a woman touched his garment and then somebody got the revelation that hey paul is a born-again believer and we see he has faith let's take some of his garments and cut them up and evil spirits will leave same thing what we do now we do the same thing it's all biblical but it started with jesus didn't start with paul started with jesus when that woman touched him of his garment what did he do it pulled and if you some of the brothers i know when you're praying for people and i'll just be honest with you i'm going to be honest anyway when you pray for people sometimes you pray for them and it's like you don't get anything it's like you don't even feel anything that's why i don't like to lay my hands on because i've seen people god bless their heart i know they're trying to do it they'll you know they grab your head and they you know i've seen them in jamaica they take the sisters and they and i don't believe in that you you shouldn't touch a sister in that place but they're trying to pray for them you know they're grabbing them praying what i do i say give me your hands that's safe give me your hands we're going to agree we're going to take hands we're going to hold our hands and we're going to agree that what's going to happen is going to happen that's just as much you don't need to be doing the slapping and grabbing and pulling and all that stuff listen some people need them small faith you shouldn't need that but virtue must be in us then when we get true virtue we can add it to our faith that's the next foundation wall now first you must have faith now here's the quote that i've been reading and don't let this throw you because we've been talking for an hour and a half on faith faith alone though won't do it that what faith to be born again won't do it all right you got to have faith and be born again then you got to have faith to have virtue then you got to have faith to have knowledge faith to have temperance and then you got to have faith that that holy ghost which is the same holy ghost down here but it's going to seal you in then you will be a manifested son of god where you'll speak the word listen the saints didn't overcome what they overcome by read your bible we'll read it we'll read it wednesday night i didn't didn't get to that they were they overcame the saints overcame by the blood of the lamb and their testimony you know what a testimony is like i tell somebody before hearsay is not admissible evidence but a testimony means you've been there when you testify that you saw that guy run over that kid you were there you're testifying a truth that is admissible in court and in the court of god your testimony if it's true is admissible nothing else in them is admissible because what is hearsay so faith alone won't do it you got then add virtue to your faith you must have virtue in order to add to your faith now one more thing before we close magicians come on you stand so your testimony it can be admitted as evidence we'll talk about wednesday night your confession and your possession it's not hearsay it's yours and god is the high priest of your feeling nope he's a high priest of your confession he's a high priest of your faith in the word of god so we come to the gentiles or we come to jesus and every time jesus would go somewhere they said oh jesus come come lay hands on my daughter come come lay hands on my son and come lay hands on this and come lay hands on that but every time he met a gentile what'd they say you just you just speak with some authority we know you have authority i have authority you have authority you just speak how many times you've been called a dog and you still want somebody to bless you it's our phoenician woman jesus told her we don't feed dogs jesus told her we don't feed dogs and she could have said bless god i'll not go back to that church again it's all in your attitude what was her attitude yay lord but the dogs have got to have some crumbs the dogs have got to eat i want to eat from what falls from your table i don't care if it's the main course i want to eat what fell on the floor and what did jesus say he said i have found no greater faith in israel and that woman's testimony is still being talked about it was a humility and attitude that you have if you have that blessed god i'm not gonna yeah you go ahead but jesus said there's no greater faith same way with a centurion you know what the century was saying he said look i know you're a man of authority because i'm a man of authority if i tell 100 people to go do this go fight this battle over on this certain street boom they go you know what he was telling jesus he said you're a man of authority i know that if you speak to a devil it's going to leave if you speak to a legion of armies of angels they're going to go do what you tell them to do that's what he was saying he called a revelation he didn't say lord i got to feel it he'll say lord touch me even jesus said hey i'll go to your house and lay hands on film no i'm not worthy you just speak the word and he said again i have found no greater faith in israel than what two gentiles that were dogs that were not even supposed to be in the promises of god yet he said i found no greater faith than just

jesus christ we pray amen just hug them just love them that's all you do holy spirit [Music] to worship and to magnify [Music] [Applause] [Music] i was telling you a story a minute ago i didn't finish it but you know people come up to be prayed for and i know some of the ministers know what i'm talking about even laithy that when when that when that thing clicks when somebody really gets something it makes you weak i know brother bob different ones and we we've witnessed that now that doesn't mean you go by feelings now i don't want you pray for everybody the same but there is some time when that thing when that when the thing lines up and then and boom you get what you get the miracle healing you get the healing right then well it draws strength out of you i mean you just about buckle your knees sometimes when that anointing comes and because what they're doing they're drawing strength not from you the person they're drawing strength from what you said the faith they had in the word of god that if you preach the true word of god to them and preach faith to them then they're drawing from that faith then that's why brother ryan said do you make him make a contact you know hold the hands or or put your hands on the head but you don't have to you don't have to do that like i said before brother brown prayed for a lot of people but a lot of times he took that little finger and he said hey only believe all things are possible whatever you have need of and they walk off the platform being healed so it's not that you have to touch them but but man it's a wonderful thing to know that we i believe we're in the right measure of faith now to where god can really move in your life your family's life your children's life your husband your your your wife anything it's just to me it's wide open if you'll believe if you'll have faith make sure you're born again make sure that that you've got all that stuff out of your life make sure that we come to church and before we walk in that door say god forgive me of all my faults and failures forgive me of that argument i just had with my wife some of us are accused or we're not accused of that some of us do that but you ask the lord because you don't want to bring that devil inside this inside this room amen amen it's listen it's a warfare paul said it was a warfare not not of human bodies y'all listen y'all are not jumping across the aisle fighting each other but during that whole service the devil and god was over there and angels were fighting a battle between all of us up here too fighting the battle they're battling in that other dimension they're battling and it ain't pretty but we know who wins amen god always wins listen it's a long-term relationship with god amen you know what he wants us to get us to know him more that's what he wants he wants to get us to know him more that's why he's let us have this walk brother john for all these years and the message of the hour when brother brown left the scene they thought it was over they just didn't know it just began and then it still took years of people with false doctrine and and do's and don'ts and like brother dick said bruised a lot of fruit and drove a lot of people away and like that girl is on the internet i can't remember what her name is but she's she's uh glad that she got out of the message because it was a cause and it was all this but she came up in an under strict home and and she just got she got preached too and she there was no love there was no love there you could tell it there was no love that's why you know sure we have to be corrective but you got to love them you got to show love that's what's telling susan if you got a problem with your kids show love show love well they need to be born again show them love well they need to get out show them love and i listen i'm sorry i'm i'm one of the world's worst jim she knows it to jump at the jump into you know crack of the whip but i've learned over the years that don't do a whole lot except make people angry you gotta love them with love but you gotta love them with godly love you love them with filial love because they're yours you'd take a bullet for us what i told hannah i said look i'll take a bullet for you but i don't like you boy i got everybody quiet you like what your kids do no you don't like what your kids do i love them i love them and would take a bullet for them with no hesitation but i'm not going to enter into their foolishness that's why i said i love them but i don't like them i you know what it's not them it's the devil inside of them i don't like it so if you'll show them the love of god keep showing them the love of god keep just putting little things in and they'll see it listen like like like brother brown said satan's a bluff he's the best bluffer there is and if you're bluffing he's already bluffed you he's a bluffer of the bluffers as laban and and jacob what did brother ernie always say he said it was one con man kind of another con man there were two con men counting each other you can't con the devil he either knows like brother like brother donnie's daddy said you either got the goods or you don't and satan knows it so you can't bluff him but listen if you'll just do what god said in the bible just try our best come to church read your bible study yeah you go you know what you're gonna go home today and you're going to sit down in your chair and the devil's going to go why are you going back for him you didn't get nothing out of that he preached on you the whole service then you know what look over the devil and say no he preached on you the whole service like brother gary longoria said he said it's not you we don't talk about the kids it's not you that we don't trust it's the devil we don't trust amen so if he starts filling your head full of stuff just tell him say look no i read over here that there's a lake that you're not going to be swimming in you're going to die in and then i've got this place over here that says if i get born again i got eternal life where's your scripture to say that satan where's your scripture that you get eternal life yeah but you're this bad and you've done this and don't want to hear it blind vanities take that take that and use that talk to the devil you know what we talk to god talk to the devil tell him say hey get out of here that preacher preached on you buddy he didn't preach on me you just gotta quit making me do these things well i don't make you do these things well yes you do no i don't yes you do no i don't see don't get an argument in them either all right we stay all day whoever would like to stay and practice the song for the meeting in ohio needs to stay in the sanctuary after the service according to sister bella and sister naila so remember that if you're going to practice your song just pray have a good service wednesday welcome we'll welcome sister sandy in god bless you she lost her husband and brother tom was a good man i know most of y'all knew him and um it was a terrible loss but uh but you know what god knows yes god knows what you can take what you can't he said he would not put any more on you than you can stand now sometimes we think it's right up to the borderline but he said and promised you know what when we you know what when we go over the borderline when no one thinks for sure y'all born again see it all goes back to being born again he's got to take care of his children he don't have to he's not obligated to take care of you if you're not born again let's bow our heads dear lord
