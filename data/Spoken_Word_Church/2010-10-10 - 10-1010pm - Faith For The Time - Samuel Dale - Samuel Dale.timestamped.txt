[24:07] word right hallelujah amen good to see
[24:10] everybody in the house of the Lord if
[24:11] you like turning your scriptures turn to
[24:14] Hebrews 6 and we've been on Hebrews 8
[24:17] for quite a while so let's drop back to
[24:20] Hebrews
[24:22] 6 and we'll be changing the title of the
[24:27] services for a little while you know
[24:30] trying to get into something to move on
[24:32] with the Lord but just remember now the
[24:34] Lord willing we will be having a brother
[24:37] Royals Serano will be preaching for us
[24:40] this coming Wednesday and just keep him
[24:43] in your prayers that the Lord would
[24:44] bless us because we want him to bless
[24:47] him to be able to get here but uh I've
[24:51] always been kind of selfish on the other
[24:53] end I like to hear cuz I believe faith
[24:56] comes by hearing and hearing by the word
[24:58] amen so just remember that now also I
[25:01] wrote myself a note I noticed what I had
[25:03] done at the end of the service but
[25:06] somebody here in the morning service
[25:08] please if you're hearing this when go
[25:09] back to the morning service I I crossed
[25:11] up Gideon and had him bringing uh
[25:14] needing a banner when he should have
[25:16] been having peace okay so that's why I
[25:18] said y'all get it right I just I'm just
[25:21] trying to preach but I noticed that and
[25:23] I picked it up and and everything and I
[25:25] said well the best thing to do is just
[25:27] uh you know straighted up this evening
[25:29] so I believe Gideon probably needed he
[25:31] brought a banner but he needed peace but
[25:34] uh you know just you keep it right so I
[25:36] always say you put it together I just
[25:38] try my best to preach and and you get
[25:40] your mind running out and going out and
[25:43] you know and it's not worth two cents
[25:45] anyway so you know so just uh just
[25:47] remember that Hebrews 6 we're going to
[25:51] be picking up a a little talk and going
[25:53] on now with what we're talking about now
[25:55] this will be a continuation it won't be
[25:58] a uh U you know starting something new
[26:01] it'll be a continuation of climbing up
[26:04] all right now remember way to be
[26:06] traveling back today and remember
[26:08] Brother Dean down speaking for his
[26:09] brother okay father we thank you we love
[26:13] you we know for assurity that thou are
[26:16] God and you change
[26:18] not Lord what we need is we need a
[26:22] change we need a change to understand
[26:25] and walk in where you want us to walk
[26:27] and Lord forgive our sins cuz we know
[26:29] that we're human Mortals and we know we
[26:31] make mistakes we're human we do things
[26:35] that are not right not in the the world
[26:38] of sin or something but maybe into just
[26:40] their own selves and their own attitudes
[26:42] and ways but we pray that you would just
[26:44] help us and lead us in understanding and
[26:48] just let your light come and dwell with
[26:50] each and every one of us bless those
[26:52] that are not here just give
[26:54] understanding to each one and you said
[26:56] in your word that you would send your
[26:57] word and heal us so we believe you and
[27:00] we take your word for it and we just
[27:02] commit it to you now have your way as we
[27:04] read your word you come and speak to our
[27:06] hearts in Jesus name
[27:11] amen now we're going to verse chapter 6
[27:14] verse 1 we'll just read three verses
[27:17] because we'll try
[27:18] to hold it to a point and then we'll
[27:22] continue on down a little bit maybe in
[27:23] another message therefore leaving the
[27:26] principles of the doctrine of Christ let
[27:29] us go on to
[27:31] Perfection not laying again the
[27:33] foundation of repentance from dead works
[27:35] and of Faith toward god of the doctrines
[27:39] of
[27:40] baptisms and of laying on of
[27:43] hands and of resurrection of the
[27:46] dead and of Eternal
[27:49] judgment now watch and this will we do
[27:53] if God permit right you may be seated
[27:56] the Lord at his Blessing I believe God
[27:59] has permitted
[28:00] Us in this last days to be able to
[28:06] uh you know move on into the Realms that
[28:10] maybe our our brothers and sisters down
[28:13] through time we're not capable capable
[28:16] of reaching because of the uh word that
[28:21] was revealed in their day and time amen
[28:25] let me check the Heat and and a because
[28:27] W's not here to to do his doings and I
[28:30] see some Fanning and some reaching for
[28:32] quilts so you know we'll get a happy
[28:36] medium
[28:38] okay it'll help everybody to get a happy
[28:41] medium okay all right
[28:45] now as I said it now we're not leaving
[28:49] what I've been on you'll see in a minute
[28:51] we'll pick it up bring it up into the
[28:54] New Testament all right and uh speaking
[28:57] of the things
[28:58] because all that we've used on the uh
[29:01] seven compound names of Jehovah has been
[29:04] related to Old Testament people and
[29:08] experiences all right now I believe that
[29:11] we need to bring that up into a new
[29:16] testament situation our
[29:19] understanding and uh you know and doing
[29:22] that then you'll see that we're not
[29:24] leaving that but we're trying to to move
[29:28] on in the doings now Paul as we've said
[29:32] for quite a
[29:34] while he he was talking and he said now
[29:37] I I want to sum this
[29:39] up that we have such a greater high
[29:44] priest all right it's wonderful because
[29:47] we put all of the honor and Glory upon
[29:49] the Lord Jesus Christ Ecclesiastes he
[29:52] says now we'll hear the conclusion of
[29:55] the
[29:56] matter bringing it down down to a a
[29:59] situation of understanding and seeing
[30:02] where we're at all right
[30:06] now what we want to do today and I'm
[30:10] telling you this ahead to where that
[30:13] when we we'll drop back and pick up and
[30:15] drop
[30:16] back I believe that in the end time that
[30:20] there is to be a message brought I
[30:25] believe it was brought by the prophet
[30:28] I believe it was to fulfill
[30:30] Zachariah that The Headstone would come
[30:33] crying Grace Grace unto it and I believe
[30:37] that that could never been understood
[30:40] until this day we had a head cu the
[30:44] church on the day of Pentecost started
[30:47] off with a head there was a head there
[30:49] but it was not the
[30:52] headstone and see then there's something
[30:54] to happen in the end time in the
[30:56] finishing up and I'm trying to just lay
[30:59] that down for you to look at it and see
[31:01] I believe that the like the prophet said
[31:04] the head and body would unite in the
[31:07] last days to bring the message amen all
[31:11] right now brother bradam had to bring it
[31:14] right you see now the body see has got
[31:19] to say the same thing as the message of
[31:23] the Prophet that's why I've tried to
[31:24] preach to you so much about you know
[31:27] that uh
[31:28] Joshua and the walls of Jericho that it
[31:31] was not the words of Joshua that brought
[31:33] down the walls of Jericho it was the
[31:36] word of the people it was the shout in
[31:38] the people amen all right see then
[31:41] that's what we must have is the message
[31:43] of the hour revealed to you and I right
[31:47] Amen in the part that we have need of to
[31:53] individuals what I mean part because
[31:54] it'll be fullness but around the world I
[31:57] believe this message around the world is
[31:59] being revealed I don't believe it's just
[32:01] Lula I never said that I've never taught
[32:03] it like that because it it would be
[32:06] incorrect see you know I I don't believe
[32:09] that everybody's gathered in Lula and
[32:11] this all is going I've never said that
[32:14] see I believe around the world that
[32:16] there is a five-fold Ministry bringing
[32:19] the message as is needed you know and
[32:23] putting it together then we we come out
[32:26] to the to to the point but I believe
[32:29] that there's a message will happen with
[32:31] the when The Headstone comes and unites
[32:32] with the body amen I said when it unites
[32:35] with the body I believe it'll be a
[32:36] messag amen all right and that message
[32:39] will be the final message to be brought
[32:45] now how long it would take to preach it
[32:46] there no problem to me because it took
[32:48] 2,000 years for us to preach that he has
[32:50] risen right I mean what are you worried
[32:52] about how long it's going to be Brother
[32:53] D you think it'll be very short well uh
[32:56] you know very soon well I'm hopeing
[32:58] right but uh you know that's because of
[33:00] the age limit we all getting on you know
[33:03] right I was kind of grinning there a
[33:04] while ago not at you and I but thinking
[33:07] about all of us here you know kind of
[33:08] we're getting kind of old and brother
[33:11] Ray he can stumble a little bit and
[33:12] brother dick he falls around and you
[33:14] know things just happens to us that
[33:16] brother Thomas back there you know he
[33:18] steps off of a ladder and all of them
[33:20] were small things like 4T right wasn't
[33:24] somebody falling off of a 40 story
[33:26] building right I think each one of them
[33:28] was about 4T that they stepped or would
[33:30] only up that much but see we're all
[33:32] getting old well I think it's time that
[33:35] we get into the message to be able to
[33:37] conquer this old age and that's what I'm
[33:41] hoping you say well what are you trying
[33:42] to do take one step at the time that's
[33:45] right now I've never believed like
[33:47] brother Mo said you look at a ladder and
[33:49] you back up you know you you run and you
[33:51] jump about three rungs and you going to
[33:53] fall and get
[33:55] hurt brother how because he done what
[33:59] we've all
[34:00] done when you get down to the L 4 foot
[34:03] on the ladder you you don't even think
[34:05] about it you just step off and he had
[34:09] done that probably thousands of times
[34:11] but there was a piper something laying
[34:14] there and it just rolled him see but we
[34:17] don't need to do that we need to take
[34:19] one step at a time well brother they
[34:21] aren't you nervous and believe we're
[34:23] going to miss it no that's what makes us
[34:25] is going to make us miss it is when we
[34:27] we get nervous you know and and and see
[34:30] we'll start trying to figure it out and
[34:32] that to me is what's happened to the
[34:34] basics of the messy people they trying
[34:36] to figure out what it's going to be
[34:38] instead of just taking one more step did
[34:41] the day of Pentecost come because of
[34:43] something that was planned
[34:46] out or was it because of God's promise
[34:49] God's promise all right the rest is
[34:52] going to be in the end time see all
[34:54] right I believe now this is I'm just
[34:57] telling you what I believe
[34:59] I believe that we're at least in the
[35:01] beginning stage of The Headstone
[35:05] message amen and I use that with as much
[35:08] honor and respect as I can to and the
[35:11] reason I use it like that then that way
[35:13] it doesn't leave anybody out everybody
[35:15] else wants to leave everybody out to try
[35:17] to claim something for their own self
[35:19] right no maybe other people are on up up
[35:23] the stature of a perfect man there's
[35:25] people all up through this pyramid right
[35:28] you know well I believe when The
[35:30] Headstone comes it'll be it'll come and
[35:32] be so uh
[35:35] simple until people won't realize what's
[35:38] going on right and I've believ for quite
[35:40] a while and been preaching for quite a
[35:42] while that I believe the headstone is
[35:45] here and that The Headstone will bring
[35:48] its own message in the end time right I
[35:50] just believe that and that's what I'm
[35:52] putting my confidence in as to seeing
[35:55] that and then we'll try to preach it
[35:58] all right now I didn't bring the this
[36:01] this in this morning I mentioned it
[36:03] but
[36:05] U let me try to explain something just a
[36:08] minute and you'll
[36:10] understand each one of those people back
[36:13] there in the Old Testament Abraham Moses
[36:17] whatever they were not born again
[36:20] believers they did not have the new
[36:22] birth cuz it hadn't come yet all right
[36:24] you say well brother Dale you know why
[36:27] we need to understand that because
[36:29] you're finding out now that a lot of
[36:31] people of the message don't believe it
[36:32] that way you the message people right
[36:36] don't believe it that way and I believe
[36:38] that whenever heard of this message
[36:40] right I believe when I was in the
[36:42] Baptist I could read the Holy Ghost had
[36:46] not been given right you know see so it
[36:50] couldn't be a new birth until the death
[36:52] of the testator
[36:53] right that you know that's never been a
[36:56] problem well you just badst well that's
[36:58] all right whatever it is I believe
[37:01] it and it'll fit the word amen see then
[37:04] that way I'm not looking and see the
[37:06] people say well you're you're
[37:07] downgrading Those Old Testament son no
[37:09] I'm not that's right now bud you better
[37:12] believe one thing for certain you're
[37:13] looking at a man that
[37:15] realizes
[37:17] Abraham was a man
[37:20] right I've tried to preach that to you
[37:23] he was not a born again
[37:25] believer he was a man
[37:28] but when God spoke to that man Abraham
[37:31] believed that God right and he stayed
[37:35] with it no matter what anybody else said
[37:37] his wife or whoever he stayed with what
[37:39] it was cuz he believed it Moses believed
[37:44] God at the burning bush well have Moses
[37:46] that just something happened you know no
[37:48] no he believed
[37:49] it and you know what he believe it SM he
[37:52] took over Egypt that's right well ain't
[37:54] too many other people that believe false
[37:56] things that take over their whole nation
[37:58] and destroy it but see they had Faith
[38:03] then for the time that they were
[38:06] needful as I was trying to say then
[38:09] Abraham didn't need a
[38:13] Healer he needed a sacrifice to take
[38:17] Isaac's
[38:19] place that was what he had need of and
[38:21] that's what God supplied
[38:24] right you see I believe that God is
[38:27] going going to supply what we need at
[38:30] Lula now have you followed me what we
[38:33] need at
[38:34] Lula we're not we're not trying to
[38:37] Pastor the whole
[38:38] world but I'm constantly looking and
[38:41] listening to try to find others that are
[38:45] preaching what if you want to be dis
[38:48] plained straight honest about it pleas
[38:51] it like I believe it bless well who are
[38:54] you I'm me who are you that's all that
[38:57] that problem I mean what I see and what
[39:01] I believe that's right that's what I
[39:03] stand on that's
[39:04] right until I'm changed and you show me
[39:07] where I'm wrong then I'll change to what
[39:09] you believe right
[39:11] right but you know just that point you
[39:14] see but each one of those people back
[39:17] there then what did they have brother
[39:19] Dale if they didn't have the new birth
[39:21] cuz they had Faith to move mountains
[39:23] they had Faith to win battles they had
[39:25] Faith to cross a ocean and you know dry
[39:29] ground great things they had faith for
[39:32] the time that they needed
[39:36] it it was not a new birth Born Again
[39:41] experience that brought that into
[39:45] reality
[39:47] right why can't we just simply believe
[39:51] God
[39:53] right yeah but he ain't never spoke to
[39:56] me
[39:59] there's the Bible right right here's the
[40:01] prophet's message
[40:04] right what are you looking for come on a
[40:08] glob something to come out of the sky
[40:10] bunp you over the head what are you
[40:11] looking
[40:15] for it's simply believe in
[40:19] God you know that Adam he just believe
[40:21] God you know what Moses he just believe
[40:25] God well if I could be like
[40:28] Abraham I know what you're saying I
[40:32] understand but remember you're talking
[40:34] about a man that wouldn't born
[40:39] again and you say you're born
[40:45] again but see a lot of times maybe we're
[40:49] not believing like those Believers back
[40:52] there believed I say we me okay
[40:57] even with the new birth brother Dale
[40:59] even with the new birth
[41:02] right because we've got a lot of
[41:04] problems Brother G I'm talking about a
[41:06] while
[41:06] ago we got a lot of problems being able
[41:09] to get two things together and the two
[41:12] things together is like I explained it
[41:13] to him this is what I believe I believe
[41:16] by the new birth and I'm illustrating
[41:18] with a circle of my hand there's the
[41:20] birth in the soul but there's a body and
[41:22] a spirit out here that has to get
[41:25] connected some way to that right I
[41:28] didn't play around with what I say in
[41:30] this morning I meant
[41:32] it your new birth is in you right right
[41:38] your healer is in you right your peace
[41:41] is in you your your righteousness is in
[41:44] you and the Rapture is in you right
[41:48] right and it started on the day of
[41:52] Pentecost because those Believers were
[41:56] Resurrected sitting in Heavenly
[41:59] places in the
[42:01] soul but they all died so
[42:05] what but somebody's not going to that's
[42:08] right when we get this person lined up
[42:11] that to me is what the stature of
[42:12] perfect man is okay Jo not a lineup
[42:15] person but let's go on
[42:17] now see then what I'm trying to get you
[42:20] to see
[42:21] is let's call what they had I tried to
[42:24] preach this one time
[42:25] before let's call call it faith for the
[42:28] time let's just take a little series on
[42:30] this and just talk about it of faith for
[42:34] the
[42:38] time now
[42:41] listen I try to explain something to
[42:44] where it will help the human mind cuz I
[42:48] realize that I'm dealing with human
[42:51] Minds okay you know what if you was up
[42:54] here preaching you'd be dealing with
[42:57] human
[42:58] Minds right
[43:01] now what if you come up
[43:06] to what if you took
[43:08] Abraham we talk about him and I'm not
[43:10] degrading because you know that's what
[43:13] you think I'm
[43:16] sorry I'm sorry you'd believe
[43:19] it but what if you took Abraham and sit
[43:21] him down in the upper room
[43:29] and the Holy Ghost is about ready to
[43:35] fall and the father of Faith as we call
[43:39] him and that's what he
[43:43] is do you
[43:50] know that the Holy Ghost couldn't fall
[43:52] until Abraham got up and walked out of
[43:53] the room
[44:00] he said brother Dale you sure think
[44:02] funny I agree with you but you tell me
[44:05] how it
[44:06] could cuz he wouldn't had anything for
[44:08] it to fell
[44:13] on there was only 120 in the upper room
[44:17] right and those were the one that had
[44:19] walked with him for three and a half
[44:24] years it took that long to be able to
[44:27] get a foundation laid in the heart of
[44:29] man that the day of Pentecost could
[44:32] come now you understand that's why I try
[44:35] to just be
[44:37] sensible I try to look at things just
[44:39] straight and blunt
[44:40] just and Abraham wouldn't had
[44:44] that cuz he wouldn't have had the three
[44:46] and 1/2 years of the ministry of Jesus
[44:48] Christ sown down in his
[44:52] heart I probably get repercussions off
[44:55] the internet on that statement but I
[44:57] still believe it you put David up there
[45:01] that problem Solomon
[45:05] Moses
[45:07] why because they would have not have
[45:09] been able to have
[45:12] faith for the
[45:16] time cuz their faith for the time was
[45:19] back over there that's right and you
[45:22] know what that faith for the time done
[45:23] for them sealed them in to when Christ
[45:27] came they could be part of it amen now
[45:31] that's how I believe
[45:33] it you express it to me some
[45:36] way but but you look like it degrading
[45:40] what I believe it'd be Hing am in
[45:45] right but you see once that happened in
[45:49] the upper
[45:52] room then you're getting to a
[45:55] place you you've got faith in your
[45:59] heart and Mankind until the new birth
[46:02] came it could only have faith for the
[46:04] time right that's what brother Rand said
[46:07] about it on he didn't say for everybody
[46:09] we talking about the little woman that
[46:11] touched the H of His
[46:12] Garment and he said she's made whole he
[46:15] said that woman came with a perfect
[46:17] faith for that time there's the title
[46:20] we'll be using for that
[46:22] time perfect faith for that time he goes
[46:26] on in the same paragraph and says the
[46:29] disciples did not have perfect
[46:33] Faith he said because the epileptic
[46:36] Child Jesus had give them the ministry
[46:39] right right to heal the sick cast out
[46:41] Devils raise the dead heal it all of it
[46:44] but when they came up against that
[46:46] epileptic
[46:48] child they couldn't cast it
[46:51] out he said because they didn't have
[46:53] perfect faith
[46:57] now he goes on to say it this way I got
[46:59] to let on the Des if you
[47:01] want he said because it's hard to have
[47:04] perfect faith without the Holy Ghost
[47:07] right he said because the Holy Ghost has
[47:10] to bring it
[47:13] amen so they didn't have perfect Faith
[47:18] right that
[47:20] faith that dwelt for the
[47:21] [Music]
[47:23] time that would hold them for whatever
[47:26] they had need of
[47:28] and it was the greatest thing that God
[47:30] could reveal in that
[47:34] day you see what my point the greatest
[47:37] thing could have ever happened with
[47:39] Abraham a
[47:41] man that could believe
[47:45] God David a
[47:47] man that would be in adultery be in all
[47:50] kind of forms of
[47:52] humanity but yet he loved God
[47:57] he said Thy word have I hid in my heart
[48:00] that I might not sin against
[48:02] thee on the way going to home from the
[48:05] bed of basba he said restore unto me the
[48:08] joy of thy
[48:14] salvation but he believe God
[48:19] he that was what brought God to the man
[48:22] that's
[48:23] right then he found a man that was
[48:25] capable
[48:28] like I've always said how many people do
[48:29] you think maybe God dealt with in the
[48:32] days of
[48:34] Abraham well they want to dealt with
[48:36] Abraham because he's dece his see you're
[48:38] just running it off you're not
[48:41] impressing me at
[48:45] all but Abraham was the only man that
[48:47] would listen to
[48:53] God when are we going to get into that
[48:55] place
[48:58] we talk about the new
[49:00] birth to put the believer inside of
[49:03] us and then we can't believe
[49:07] God here's a man that believed god
[49:09] without the new
[49:11] birth
[49:17] right those Old Testament Saints had
[49:20] Faith then for the
[49:22] time that little woman she had faith for
[49:25] the time those it was healed in the time
[49:27] of Jesus faith for the
[49:31] time but there was a time
[49:34] came when a group of people didn't have
[49:37] just say faith for the
[49:39] time now you going to think I cross
[49:41] myself in a minute because I'm coming
[49:43] right back
[49:44] there but they had God's
[49:48] faith
[49:49] right God's
[49:53] faith the new birth amen
[50:00] but then so much had got polluted down
[50:02] through the church ages until you look
[50:04] at Martin Luther and them and you wonder
[50:07] what did they
[50:10] have well in comparison to the book of
[50:12] Acts Martin Luther had the new birth
[50:16] amen don't mess me up right there now
[50:19] and think I'm saying something wrong he
[50:21] had a new
[50:23] birth but compare that with the day of
[50:25] Pentecost he was holding on to faith for
[50:28] the time right cuz that was all God
[50:31] could reveal to
[50:32] him right as all he could reveal was the
[50:36] just you live by
[50:39] faith see we have faith for the
[50:43] time we have the new
[50:46] birth their faith for the time didn't
[50:49] give them the new birth but our faith
[50:51] for the time gives us a new
[50:53] birth and puts us to a place to believe
[50:56] God
[50:58] God and why we can't we believe
[51:04] it you mean they could take you now and
[51:07] deprogram you send you to some kind of a
[51:09] school and deprogram you and take you
[51:12] back to a trinity don't believe
[51:16] so you
[51:21] know but you know they can if you don't
[51:23] have a new birth right
[51:28] they can do it if you don't have the new
[51:32] birth they can't deprogram the you birth
[51:36] right no you want de programs in New
[51:38] Birth so you say well brother Dale you
[51:41] saying all those people are lost at this
[51:42] that no sir no sir that's between them
[51:45] and
[51:46] God right I'm just trying to preach
[51:48] truth right
[51:51] see Fai for the
[51:55] time now I'm saying this and then I'll
[51:57] get off this page
[51:59] right so then when you're born
[52:02] again and there is more advancement to
[52:06] come and you're standing with faith for
[52:08] the
[52:11] time but when you receive the faith of
[52:13] the
[52:15] fathers and there's more to
[52:18] come that becomes faith for the time
[52:21] because it's what's to hold you at that
[52:23] place
[52:27] but see Jesus wasn't faith for the
[52:32] time he was the faith
[52:36] right but you know what it took all of
[52:39] their faith for the time to produce
[52:43] him he could have not walked out of
[52:45] there had it not been all of those
[52:47] Believers with faith for the
[52:51] time neither can the end time come
[52:57] unless the bride of Christ is able to
[52:58] stand upon all of the
[53:00] things that has been brought unto
[53:04] us and maybe even look at it that maybe
[53:06] this is Faith for the time because
[53:09] there's more to
[53:10] come that's why I never make never tried
[53:13] to make dates and times and Seasons I
[53:16] was telling Brother Gary and Brother Don
[53:17] a while ago that remember the series I
[53:19] preached a year or two ago I don't know
[53:21] how long it is cu you know old age just
[53:24] gets you and you lose all of it I reckon
[53:26] but
[53:27] couple of years ago I preached a message
[53:29] called
[53:31] faith and you know what I
[53:33] thought I thought i' probably got three
[53:36] or four more sermons to
[53:37] preach you know CU I kind of you and I
[53:41] thought when that finishes up the
[53:44] Rapture will be right there we'll be
[53:46] gone I thought
[53:49] that but I got down to the last couple
[53:52] of
[53:54] messages and I realized
[53:57] it it wouldn't going to take
[54:03] place I realized that what I was looking
[54:06] at was the
[54:09] beginning instead of the
[54:12] ending Brother Gary can relate to me
[54:14] easily because he called me one time and
[54:16] he thought I was really against him he
[54:19] he really thought I was taring down his
[54:21] bubble cuz he said brother Dale I see it
[54:23] this is the end this is all of it
[54:27] well I asked him a question or two about
[54:29] it you know and I said Brother Gary you
[54:32] just now saw the
[54:35] beginning well today he'll tell you that
[54:38] that's
[54:39] right but that day he didn't believe I
[54:42] was
[54:42] right but it wasn't that I God had
[54:45] showed me something it just the fact
[54:46] that I knew that see he was standing in
[54:50] the place I was
[54:52] standing and that that was you know that
[54:55] was it
[54:57] but see I will tell you like this I've
[54:59] told you many many times brother
[55:01] about 1971 somewhere right in
[55:04] there he preached a message and he came
[55:07] out one day and he was preaching on the
[55:10] uh you know Revelations 3:14 the
[55:13] beginning of the creation of God and uh
[55:15] he came out and he said brother Dale I
[55:17] just caught it the old building was
[55:19] across this way he looked across and I
[55:21] know where I sitting right there in the
[55:22] window you know and he said brother Dale
[55:25] this is the life
[55:27] message and I sat there for a second and
[55:30] I said
[55:35] amen because he wasn't saying that was
[55:37] the last
[55:38] [Music]
[55:39] sermon he's saying this is the last
[55:42] message the life message the message to
[55:44] this age is the beginning of the
[55:46] creation of God this is the last message
[55:48] I can say that today the beginning of
[55:50] the creation of God this is the life
[55:52] message God is not another message
[55:55] beyond that
[55:56] when you and I come into completeness of
[55:58] the the creation of God it'll all be
[56:01] over with that's
[56:03] right but then you see what I'm talking
[56:05] about maybe sometimes we've got faith
[56:07] for the time but you know Abraham held
[56:10] on what he had you know what it brought
[56:14] it brought a
[56:15] baby right
[56:18] right it brought a
[56:21] baby let's just hold on and let's kind
[56:24] of showing you where we're going let's
[56:26] go back to
[56:27] Hebrews
[56:30] 6 the very odd statements that Paul
[56:34] would
[56:36] make therefore which means wherefore or
[56:39] whatever something's fix to take place
[56:41] or what's going on we settle it down
[56:44] right here therefore leaving the
[56:47] principles of the doctrine of
[56:50] Christ let us go on to Perfection not
[56:54] laying again the foundation of
[56:56] repentance from dead works and a faith
[56:59] toward
[57:01] God now I'll read you a statement in a
[57:03] minute but you know we used to read
[57:08] that and that was mass
[57:11] confusion but anybody that's been in the
[57:13] message very long and at least read the
[57:15] Hebrew
[57:16] Book you can come up with a
[57:20] summation of things
[57:22] and answer what I would say
[57:29] Paul what are you
[57:34] saying therefore leaving the
[57:37] principles principles it's Beginnings
[57:42] right let us go on to
[57:47] Perfection the word Perfection there
[57:49] goes into the word
[57:52] completion Paul is saying therefore
[57:54] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[57:57] of Christ let us go on to the change of
[58:00] these bodies
[58:02] right till everything is made
[58:06] manifest
[58:08] see now we have Carpenters with us
[58:13] anybody with one eye in high sense
[58:14] brother R used to say I we like that a
[58:17] good
[58:18] point but I mean any of the little kids
[58:21] in here you know that's few years old
[58:24] especially my kids grandkids or some
[58:26] something they they kind of know a
[58:27] little bit about work you know of laying
[58:30] a foundation or
[58:32] something now when you building a house
[58:35] you put down a
[58:38] foundation okay now you don't want that
[58:42] Foundation to
[58:45] crack now what happens if the foundation
[58:50] cracks you look at the foundation no you
[58:53] don't have to look at the foundation go
[58:55] inside the
[58:57] house
[58:58] right and walk around till you find a
[59:01] wall and there's a big old crack right
[59:03] down that especially if it's a concrete
[59:09] wall why something wrong your
[59:14] foundation
[59:16] right so in Christianity don't ever
[59:18] think no more than you would of a
[59:20] building in the building of a building
[59:22] you never leave the foundation
[59:27] everything in this building the tons
[59:29] that are setting upon
[59:31] it is setting on a foundation right if
[59:36] we had anything else it's setting on the
[59:41] foundation so never think about even in
[59:44] Christianity never think about leaving
[59:47] your foundation that's where the people
[59:49] of this message is going
[59:52] wrong the foundation of this message is
[59:54] the Bible right right
[59:56] now how can you take the Bible and get
[59:59] two Souls Two Lords River Jordan brues
[1:00:03] Etc how can you get that out of the
[1:00:05] Bible they would automatically admit you
[1:00:07] couldn't do it if you just had that
[1:00:10] alone but they have quotes and things
[1:00:13] that they think makes it able to be able
[1:00:17] to uh you know we used to have a joke
[1:00:20] that you know you'd say well what's
[1:00:23] going to hold that up
[1:00:26] and uh you said well just gets you a sky
[1:00:29] hook anybody ever heard that right this
[1:00:32] gets you a sky hook
[1:00:34] right well see it was plain enough to
[1:00:37] show you didn't I no sense because it
[1:00:40] ain't no such thing as a Skyhook cuz
[1:00:43] they Ain nowhere to hook
[1:00:45] it see it was just a way of life and
[1:00:48] making fun right but see that to me is
[1:00:51] the way the doctrines
[1:00:54] are if you can't come back to this Bible
[1:00:57] and show me your Doctrine in this Bible
[1:00:59] I see it right there then I believe
[1:01:01] you're sitting hanging your faith on a
[1:01:03] Skyhook
[1:01:06] right because it won't and they won't do
[1:01:09] it all right but you never
[1:01:13] leave your principal
[1:01:17] Foundation now the Bible
[1:01:19] says about Ephesians
[1:01:22] 2:20 that we're built on the
[1:01:24] foundation are the apostles and
[1:01:28] Prophets now that's just not fivefold
[1:01:30] Ministry prophets to me is Apostles New
[1:01:34] Testament prophets Old
[1:01:36] Testament Apostles and
[1:01:39] Prophets Jesus
[1:01:42] Christ being the Chief Cornerstone right
[1:01:46] right
[1:01:49] now the Chief Cornerstone is what you
[1:01:51] tie everything to you ought to go over
[1:01:53] to Israel walk down in a hole and look
[1:01:55] Neer Rock there man almost as big as
[1:01:58] this
[1:02:00] building and that's the foundation for
[1:02:03] the wall and the building of the where
[1:02:06] the the U Ark of the Covenant and all
[1:02:09] other things are supposed to be the
[1:02:12] temple CU you got to lay anything you
[1:02:14] got to put it on a
[1:02:16] foundation and the Bible talks about a
[1:02:18] sure
[1:02:19] Foundation you remember Jesus about
[1:02:21] putting it on Sand and how that carries
[1:02:24] of life and things wor build it on a
[1:02:27] good
[1:02:27] foundation you know and you can go right
[1:02:30] out in the desert and build your
[1:02:32] house but as quick as thing starts going
[1:02:35] wrong what's going to happen so what do
[1:02:37] you do the only way you can build it is
[1:02:40] you got to build it on a platform that
[1:02:42] would keep it from sinking or you're
[1:02:45] going to have to put Timbers down to get
[1:02:48] to something solid okay now we're built
[1:02:51] on the foundation of Apostles and
[1:02:54] Prophets Jes Jesus Christ being the
[1:02:56] Chief
[1:02:59] Cornerstone now I want to relate two
[1:03:01] things
[1:03:04] together those
[1:03:07] Apostles I know what brother R said he
[1:03:10] said Paul was the only one that
[1:03:11] understood Jehovah the old was Jesus of
[1:03:14] the
[1:03:15] new all now but brother Randon you're
[1:03:18] not saying Peter and him didn't
[1:03:20] understand
[1:03:22] nothing so what are you saying Paul had
[1:03:25] a greater understanding
[1:03:27] right what do you think Peter
[1:03:32] believed Peter could explain to you
[1:03:35] probably all of the Jehovah Gyra Jehovah
[1:03:39] tishu Jehovah
[1:03:41] Raa he could explain all
[1:03:44] that cuz that's what he
[1:03:46] believed but he just didn't have the
[1:03:49] depth of
[1:03:52] believing that it would take the Paul
[1:03:56] to come forth
[1:03:58] with cuz Paul would be the one that
[1:04:00] would take us back and we would have a
[1:04:04] gauge to look and see if we were back on
[1:04:07] the face of the
[1:04:09] fathers now Paul never rebuked Peter for
[1:04:13] being off in Doctrine right no he
[1:04:17] rebuked him for his actions in life
[1:04:19] right because he believed exactly the
[1:04:21] same God right Paul and Peter had the
[1:04:25] same same
[1:04:26] Revelation but then why would Paul say
[1:04:30] leaving the
[1:04:31] principles of the doctrin of
[1:04:36] Christ so he's not saying leave it
[1:04:40] like throw it away get rid of it we
[1:04:42] don't need it
[1:04:44] anymore no what's he
[1:04:47] saying he's saying we're built on a
[1:04:49] foundation of Apostles and Prophets cuz
[1:04:51] he was the one that said
[1:04:53] that so here he's not saying leaving
[1:04:57] that he's saying go on right keep that
[1:05:02] as your foundation and go
[1:05:07] on now I've been bringing this up to
[1:05:10] this point
[1:05:11] to that we've been talking about the
[1:05:13] seven compound names of
[1:05:15] Jehovah that is a foundational
[1:05:18] structural Stone of the Old Testament
[1:05:21] would you agree amen you know that's the
[1:05:23] foundation of the Old Testament is the
[1:05:26] revealing of Jehovah
[1:05:30] God now was Paul and them saiding well
[1:05:35] we understand all about that we don't
[1:05:36] need that no more no
[1:05:41] no but Paul said leaving the
[1:05:45] principles he had explained the great
[1:05:47] things back through the scriptures but
[1:05:50] he
[1:05:51] seen that there was something wrong
[1:05:56] now what did he
[1:05:59] do he
[1:06:02] said upon our foundation that we
[1:06:06] have let us not just keep laying the
[1:06:10] foundation
[1:06:12] right you said well boy we got the
[1:06:15] foundation what are you doing now well
[1:06:17] we're laying another
[1:06:19] Foundation years later you said what are
[1:06:21] you doing now we're laying another
[1:06:23] Foundation
[1:06:27] now you going after a while you're going
[1:06:29] to sure have a high wall of
[1:06:32] foundation you know it's not needed that
[1:06:36] way but you lay your foundation you get
[1:06:39] it
[1:06:40] right and then you start from there then
[1:06:44] you put down the floor joy you put the
[1:06:46] flooring down you put down the studs you
[1:06:48] put down you know you start building a
[1:06:50] house right so that's leaving the
[1:06:54] principles
[1:06:56] that's leaving that
[1:06:58] foundation in the bases that you're
[1:07:01] going
[1:07:03] on all
[1:07:06] right see but you're not leaving it like
[1:07:09] setting it out in mid Irish you're the
[1:07:11] foundation but we set the house over
[1:07:13] here you no no no we don't believe in
[1:07:19] skyhooks but you see you got to go on to
[1:07:21] be able to build a house right now would
[1:07:24] that be the same thing as people pet
[1:07:28] saying now this is a quote from Brother
[1:07:30] BR where he said how Faith to be born
[1:07:31] again cuz he's talking about Statue of
[1:07:33] perfect man he said now you add to your
[1:07:35] faith virtue knowledge Temperance
[1:07:37] patience God in this what was he
[1:07:39] building a
[1:07:42] house right to go on and remember now if
[1:07:48] the man himself would be saying let's do
[1:07:52] this then he was teaching people to how
[1:07:55] to get where he
[1:07:57] was he wasn't saying Peter you already
[1:08:01] have it and let me teach you no he was
[1:08:05] trying to teach little babies to come to
[1:08:07] where he was cuz that was their purpose
[1:08:10] that was
[1:08:11] their faith for the
[1:08:14] time the faith for the time of the the
[1:08:17] apostles was to lay a
[1:08:20] foundation put Jesus Christ as the Chief
[1:08:23] Cornerstone
[1:08:25] try to build a body in the bases of
[1:08:29] Faith vers knowledge
[1:08:31] temp but then wait because Paul knew
[1:08:35] that the Rapture was not coming right
[1:08:41] then now you want scripture what was
[1:08:45] it they must come a falling away first
[1:08:49] right and the man of sin be
[1:08:52] revealed he knew it was not coming he
[1:08:55] says
[1:08:57] what the Lord himself one of these days
[1:09:01] is going to descend from heaven with a
[1:09:04] shout right brother Randon said he was
[1:09:07] trying to get it out of the people's
[1:09:08] mind that God was coming right then
[1:09:11] right but see we had that messed
[1:09:14] up cuz we had it Paul preaching him boy
[1:09:18] he was trying to get him to see card was
[1:09:19] right there Then Bo he just well might
[1:09:22] have stirred up a little in her energy
[1:09:24] but it was in the
[1:09:28] gospel they were not in the faith for
[1:09:30] the time the faith for the time was the
[1:09:33] Apostle Paul
[1:09:38] knowing that Jesus Christ was not coming
[1:09:40] right
[1:09:44] then now that's contrary
[1:09:47] to 99% of religious
[1:09:51] society that may be a very low number
[1:09:53] matter say 99.99
[1:09:56] because see ever since I've been in this
[1:09:58] message they've been telling me when the
[1:09:59] Lord's coming he's going come in 73 he
[1:10:02] going 774 he going to come in 77 he's
[1:10:05] going to come in brother colle GRE in
[1:10:08] cuz we've been down through that he's
[1:10:10] going to come near he going everybody
[1:10:12] want to tell you when he's coming and
[1:10:14] Paul is telling them he ain't
[1:10:17] coming that's
[1:10:19] right settle
[1:10:23] down now not your fall s I tell what no
[1:10:27] settle down in what you
[1:10:29] got amen and hold fast is that know what
[1:10:34] the scripture
[1:10:36] say examine yourself to see whether
[1:10:39] you're in the faith or not hold
[1:10:42] fast cuz it's coming to
[1:10:45] persecution that's what Paul was
[1:10:48] telling see we think well Paul trying to
[1:10:51] BU no no no he was trying to tell them
[1:10:54] if they live long enough that's going to
[1:10:56] die for what they
[1:10:59] believed see we get it all messed
[1:11:03] up we preach Paul with the great thing
[1:11:06] and listen he did have a great
[1:11:11] faith I walked out here one day and I
[1:11:14] preached the message and I said
[1:11:15] according to what God has revealed to me
[1:11:17] there's going to be a lot of people
[1:11:20] die Believers in the message even born
[1:11:23] again Believers are going to die go by
[1:11:25] the
[1:11:29] grave because it's going to take
[1:11:31] something to stand there that last
[1:11:33] minute and be
[1:11:34] changed and listen folks every one of us
[1:11:38] in this building might be in that group
[1:11:40] that's going to go by the
[1:11:43] grave you don't give us much hope I
[1:11:46] don't I don't play games
[1:11:49] either I don't try to tell you how goody
[1:11:52] goody you
[1:11:53] are because you go to Lula
[1:11:57] right but now
[1:12:00] listen Paul said there was no other
[1:12:04] Foundation could be
[1:12:06] laid than what was already
[1:12:12] laid so now why I try to keep
[1:12:15] on laying on the
[1:12:20] foundation well all we need to preach is
[1:12:22] dress and hair and clothes this we'll
[1:12:24] get to that that you know what brother R
[1:12:27] called
[1:12:31] that dead
[1:12:37] Works hang around let's see if he said
[1:12:40] it dead
[1:12:43] Works cuz ain't one of them going to put
[1:12:46] you in in the body of Christ and ain't
[1:12:48] one of them going to save you they one
[1:12:50] of them going to put you in the
[1:12:53] Rapture okay now let's turn the story
[1:12:55] around but because you go do them things
[1:12:57] proves that you're not in the Rapture
[1:12:59] proves that you're not in the faith and
[1:13:01] proves that you're lost
[1:13:04] right see people don't like me to preach
[1:13:06] cuz that's just rough that that teares
[1:13:08] it down to the hide cuz it don't give
[1:13:10] you no place to hide does it well
[1:13:13] brother D just don't understand I've got
[1:13:15] this
[1:13:16] problem I got this
[1:13:20] problem what kind of a problem you got
[1:13:25] I thought we believed in a problem
[1:13:27] solver yeah you
[1:13:30] know but now follow me cuz I'm just
[1:13:32] trying to get a point to
[1:13:37] you Paul said leaving the
[1:13:43] principles of the doctrine of
[1:13:45] Christ let us go on to
[1:13:50] Perfection so now if he was right
[1:13:56] okay that's right then there must be a
[1:13:59] place
[1:14:01] somewhere that
[1:14:03] somebody
[1:14:05] sometime will reach right amen or he
[1:14:08] would have not said let us go on to a
[1:14:11] position a place of
[1:14:13] perfection but you know what he was just
[1:14:17] saying he was saying we ain't there yet
[1:14:26] right right cuz if he saying let us go
[1:14:35] on I said brother Tim let us go on to
[1:14:39] New York you know what that means we a
[1:14:42] there
[1:14:44] amen right say Welly it's good to be
[1:14:48] here see I'm trying to drive it
[1:14:51] down for you to think about what the
[1:14:54] scriptures say
[1:15:02] because the prophet says it like this
[1:15:04] and I'll give you these if you want
[1:15:07] them listen to what he had to
[1:15:15] say he said now le in the principles of
[1:15:18] the doctrines of Christ this is Hebrew
[1:15:20] series chapter 5 and 6 preach 1957 9:08
[1:15:24] the morning service paragraph 174
[1:15:27] through
[1:15:29] uh
[1:15:32] 180 in brown of
[1:15:35] Tabernacle I know we have
[1:15:37] healings that's
[1:15:40] wonderful we have
[1:15:43] visions oh that's that's
[1:15:46] fine yes spiritual
[1:15:50] dreams and sometimes they're not to
[1:15:52] spiritual dreams
[1:15:56] and sometimes you we try to help the
[1:15:59] poor we do what we can well that's all
[1:16:03] right but that's not what we're talking
[1:16:06] about now we're entering into another
[1:16:13] phase oh yes we got the doctrine of
[1:16:17] Christ we believe he was a Son of God
[1:16:19] and virgin
[1:16:22] born now listen he's tell you what he
[1:16:24] believes
[1:16:25] then he's telling you we need to go
[1:16:28] on we believe that with all these things
[1:16:32] that is
[1:16:33] wonderful but leaving that let us go
[1:16:36] into Perfection oh I wish I had the
[1:16:38] voice for an archangel now try to bring
[1:16:40] it to a
[1:16:42] place he said now
[1:16:45] what talking about the theologians and
[1:16:48] and all and all about how we believe in
[1:16:50] the deity of Christ how he was God made
[1:16:53] flesh and all these other things Paul
[1:16:57] goes on to explain it all here just in a
[1:17:01] moment but laying again to Foundation
[1:17:03] repentance of dead works we'll get back
[1:17:06] to this we believe in
[1:17:09] that Faith toward God we believe in that
[1:17:13] doctrine of
[1:17:14] baptisms and just how you must be
[1:17:16] baptized we believe that laying on the
[1:17:20] hands we believe in lay on the hands
[1:17:22] don't we Resurrection of the Dead We
[1:17:26] Believe
[1:17:31] fa see here we can believe in Eternal
[1:17:37] judgment you believe in Eternal
[1:17:40] judgment how do you
[1:17:51] believe but we need to go on
[1:17:58] amen
[1:18:00] H what do you
[1:18:03] mean I mean we've got these things
[1:18:08] laid what is your foundation of Apostles
[1:18:10] and Prophets one God water baptism
[1:18:14] baptism plural Holy Ghost baptism water
[1:18:16] baptism that's why it said
[1:18:19] baptisms we believe in the
[1:18:22] resurrection we believe in etern
[1:18:26] judgment now wait just a minute now
[1:18:28] how's it Eternal judgment well your
[1:18:30] Prophet explains it that the Judgment of
[1:18:34] God is
[1:18:35] eternal because once he judges that's it
[1:18:38] but there's not going to be an eternal
[1:18:40] judgment you we're going to set down in
[1:18:43] eternity and Jud no
[1:18:47] no there'll come a time that even The
[1:18:49] Sinner is
[1:18:52] destroyed right that's right put a
[1:18:55] judgment that way it's not not sitting
[1:18:57] down and just we're going to just have
[1:18:58] eternal judgment no it's meaning that
[1:19:02] once you're
[1:19:04] judged you're
[1:19:07] judged we don't believe in another
[1:19:09] judgment after this do we don't we
[1:19:11] believe that whatever we are here as the
[1:19:14] tree lean so will it fall as we say what
[1:19:17] we do here is our
[1:19:21] judgment
[1:19:23] right would you see
[1:19:25] he said we're entering into another
[1:19:30] phase laying the
[1:19:33] foundation get your water baptism right
[1:19:36] get your Holy Ghost baptism right get
[1:19:39] you revelation of God right get your
[1:19:42] judgment right get the resurrection
[1:19:45] right and then we got to go
[1:19:50] home got to go on to what
[1:19:58] we got to go on I'll use this scripture
[1:19:59] but I'll give it to you now he goes on
[1:20:01] in talking about you know if you sin
[1:20:04] willful after receiving the knowledge of
[1:20:06] the truth there remaineth no more
[1:20:08] sacrifice but it's impossible for those
[1:20:10] to Once enlightened and tasted the
[1:20:13] Heavenly
[1:20:15] gift to fall
[1:20:20] away you said yeah that's the way we
[1:20:22] believe it we believe it
[1:20:26] you ever tasted have it
[1:20:28] right you fall away it's impossible if
[1:20:31] you'd never be saved
[1:20:34] okay that's the way the prophet
[1:20:36] explained
[1:20:39] it we didn't have about him explain it
[1:20:41] like
[1:20:43] this he said Paul is telling
[1:20:46] you that if you've tasted the Heavenly
[1:20:50] gift and being partakers of the Holy
[1:20:53] Ghost it's impossible possible for you
[1:20:55] to ever fall
[1:21:00] right that's a little different other
[1:21:02] way say in
[1:21:04] name one of them is just looking at it
[1:21:07] as a you know the impossible if you'd
[1:21:10] ever be saved let's see
[1:21:16] that's question and answer on the Holy
[1:21:18] Ghost 1959
[1:21:20] 1219 now he's talking about what people
[1:21:22] looked at it it looks like the way we're
[1:21:25] reading it there that a man could
[1:21:27] receive the Holy Ghost and then back and
[1:21:30] then be then backslide and be lost and
[1:21:33] he said that's the way people think
[1:21:35] that's saying
[1:21:36] it but it's impossible for him to do
[1:21:39] that see he can't do it if he did Christ
[1:21:46] died now I'm reading what your prophecy
[1:21:49] it's impossible for those who once
[1:21:51] Enlighten what what's he speaking to
[1:21:54] he's speaking to those borderline
[1:21:58] Jews he never said a man being filled
[1:22:00] with the Holy Ghost he said he's tasted
[1:22:04] of the word of God but a man filled with
[1:22:07] the Holy Ghost it's impossible for him
[1:22:09] to be lost Hebrews 19 uh chapter 6
[1:22:13] paragraph
[1:22:15] 214 57908 evening and we sometimes
[1:22:19] believe that that was the man who was
[1:22:21] once enlightened and fell away again but
[1:22:24] but the Bible doesn't read it that way
[1:22:26] it is absolutely impossible for a man he
[1:22:30] says here that has received the Holy
[1:22:32] Spirit to Ever Fall
[1:22:38] Away
[1:22:40] now if we're going on to
[1:22:44] Perfection then we would not be dealing
[1:22:49] with whether we're borderline Believers
[1:22:51] or
[1:22:53] not right
[1:22:58] if we're born line Believers we got a
[1:23:00] lot of problems right in other words if
[1:23:03] we're not born again we're going a lot
[1:23:06] problems amen cuz we have at least at
[1:23:09] Lula tasted of the word of God
[1:23:13] Amen we haven't been to six and seven
[1:23:16] sermons that goes on in a lot of
[1:23:18] churches or whatever they do and that's
[1:23:19] their
[1:23:21] business God has led us throughout the
[1:23:24] world
[1:23:29] but then you get all stuff shirt and boy
[1:23:31] bless God we got the word Lula well you
[1:23:34] just tasted
[1:23:37] amen you just tasted of the
[1:23:41] word because if you ever get the word
[1:23:44] and it revealed you would never make a
[1:23:47] statement like
[1:23:49] that you would never even think like
[1:23:52] that you would never think look what
[1:23:54] we've
[1:23:55] got cuz my Bible says everything you get
[1:24:00] you know what happens the Bible says you
[1:24:03] receive
[1:24:06] it ever notice your Prophet saying even
[1:24:09] the air we breathe is a blessing from
[1:24:11] God right
[1:24:13] amen everything we have we have received
[1:24:18] I work for mine well who woke you up as
[1:24:21] sister Johnny always
[1:24:23] says right
[1:24:25] who got you up to go to work
[1:24:29] right do you see what I'm trying to
[1:24:31] bring
[1:24:34] out is we think we understand a lot of
[1:24:39] things and Paul was
[1:24:42] saying therefore Le in the
[1:24:45] principles of the doctrines of
[1:24:50] Christ doctrine of baptism lay on the
[1:24:53] hands
[1:24:55] and of the resurrection of the
[1:24:58] dead and of Eternal
[1:25:02] judgment well I why they call it Eternal
[1:25:05] judgment because once it's judged your
[1:25:07] that judgment is eternal you won't sit
[1:25:09] somewhere and wait for an eternity to
[1:25:11] get judged
[1:25:13] right you know in line down through
[1:25:15] there it means that whatever is Judge
[1:25:18] your judge
[1:25:22] already amen amen why can't we leave the
[1:25:26] principles but see then you got the
[1:25:29] arguments by everybody whether this is
[1:25:31] right or that is right this is right or
[1:25:32] that is right or like one man said one
[1:25:34] time he said to us he
[1:25:38] said well brother rand's not
[1:25:41] here to show us what's right well some
[1:25:45] of us told him said well we've got the
[1:25:47] books and texes well we don't know what
[1:25:49] that means oh my cuz the prophet is not
[1:25:52] here to tell us oh my well I don't I can
[1:25:56] read
[1:25:58] right right but the point I'm getting
[1:26:03] that are we going to just stay with the
[1:26:06] little simple
[1:26:10] things of the one God the water
[1:26:13] baptism no Eternal Hells or or things
[1:26:17] like
[1:26:18] that or are we going to try to go
[1:26:21] on Amen into affection
[1:26:28] W not laying again the
[1:26:32] foundation of dead
[1:26:36] works you mean you got to tell
[1:26:40] people I'll try to just close it this
[1:26:45] way people say well y'all just don't
[1:26:47] Brother D them Don't Preach about lul
[1:26:49] about women's dress and hair and stuff
[1:26:51] like that you don't preach you mean you
[1:26:53] got to tell B Born Again Believers let
[1:26:55] me quote brother brand you don't have to
[1:26:57] tell to ride one
[1:27:01] time that's his
[1:27:03] words you mean you got to preach every
[1:27:05] service on dress and hiring
[1:27:13] clothes but when are we going to leave
[1:27:15] the principles cuz won't you agree that
[1:27:17] that's at least a principal Point
[1:27:22] amen I mean I don't have to say a word
[1:27:25] to my wife ever since we come into this
[1:27:29] message I've never told her what clothes
[1:27:32] to
[1:27:34] wear our daughter Anna I never told her
[1:27:38] what clothes to
[1:27:45] wear well wife took care of the clothes
[1:27:47] until and I got old
[1:27:51] enough she went to school and they told
[1:27:53] her said you're going to have to dress
[1:27:55] out or you a fail to
[1:27:58] class you know in physical
[1:28:04] education first time I called up which
[1:28:06] was a friend of mine was principal I
[1:28:08] called him up and I said well you know
[1:28:10] we got a problem here and he said what I
[1:28:12] said my daughter don't wear no pants or
[1:28:15] stuff likeu that she's been told that
[1:28:17] she would fail a class if she didn't
[1:28:20] dress
[1:28:22] out he said I'll take care of it he took
[1:28:24] her out of that
[1:28:26] class I said listen I'm not trying to
[1:28:28] get you to teaching my daughter to be
[1:28:30] lazy or anything I said you make her do
[1:28:33] anything she can do in the dress she can
[1:28:37] run she can do
[1:28:40] things she wind up
[1:28:43] playing uh tennis and stuff like
[1:28:47] that with a dress
[1:28:52] on see we say but now the teacher the
[1:28:55] school says that you got to dress out
[1:28:59] we'll challenge the school anytime you
[1:29:01] want
[1:29:04] to and we won't even mention the
[1:29:08] Bible would would you say we don't
[1:29:10] believe in word girls
[1:29:12] wording you mean you're telling me that
[1:29:15] I I can't believe
[1:29:20] that you know not even putting religion
[1:29:23] in it we're just talking
[1:29:26] natural so now if you're going to do
[1:29:28] that then how can you have a school that
[1:29:32] forces girls to wear
[1:29:34] skirts and boys to wear
[1:29:38] pants have plenty of them a you dress
[1:29:42] codes you know we call it
[1:29:45] right but you see they're not going to
[1:29:47] bother you it's your flimsy
[1:29:52] excuse but but you don't want to put
[1:29:54] yourself on the
[1:29:56] line I told him that he said Sam don't
[1:29:58] worry about it he said we got a family
[1:30:01] here they don't wear pants either
[1:30:04] they'll be taken care
[1:30:06] of well you know the next year they come
[1:30:09] up with L this and and I just took care
[1:30:10] of the F
[1:30:12] staff what become part of her by
[1:30:22] then but you see if that's all we've got
[1:30:25] this hiring clothes and whether or not
[1:30:28] we to be stealing or cheating
[1:30:30] or smoking or running around with women
[1:30:34] or if that's all we got to talk
[1:30:38] about that ain't even the principles
[1:30:41] Paul was
[1:30:45] saying that ought to be done by the new
[1:30:48] birth right
[1:30:53] [Music]
[1:30:56] he said well I bless God like one man
[1:30:58] said when time said you ain't going to
[1:31:00] die and go to hell for killing the deer
[1:31:02] on
[1:31:06] Sunday I said
[1:31:08] no you tell your son that you die and go
[1:31:11] to hell because of
[1:31:14] unbelief solve that
[1:31:21] problem you mean it's no no no because
[1:31:24] run around said if you're out in the
[1:31:26] woods the way back where you can't go to
[1:31:28] church he said go ahead not on
[1:31:31] Sunday not going to die and go to hell
[1:31:34] for smoking or drinking or running
[1:31:37] around with women no you're not going to
[1:31:38] do it you're going to go to hell for
[1:31:41] unbelief why cuz it proves what you're
[1:31:43] doing right that ain't even the
[1:31:49] principles Paul never even covered that
[1:31:54] that's what I never have figured out I
[1:31:55] know I'm M for but I never figured out
[1:31:58] how they so much higher en
[1:32:00] closed and even two-tone shoes could be
[1:32:04] preached out of a Bible that I've never
[1:32:06] read that in or wearing watches or long
[1:32:08] sleeves or and you know I've never read
[1:32:11] it in the
[1:32:17] Bible I don't understand that cuz that
[1:32:21] ain't even the principles
[1:32:25] Paul is saying the principles is the one
[1:32:27] God the water
[1:32:29] baptism and no eternal
[1:32:32] hell what 90% of the people in this
[1:32:35] message preach as being the
[1:32:39] message it's not even the
[1:32:42] principles of the Apostle
[1:32:48] Paul well we don't have time fool in
[1:32:51] deep things
[1:32:54] you Paul said one
[1:32:58] God faith toward
[1:33:01] God doctrine of
[1:33:07] Christ when we got time for the Deep
[1:33:12] things no you ain't got time because
[1:33:14] you're not in the body you're not in the
[1:33:16] the correct
[1:33:18] order when we get down and preach what
[1:33:21] Paul preached in Hebrews 6
[1:33:24] then you will be capable of leaving it
[1:33:27] cuz you can't leave it until you stand
[1:33:29] there oh my come
[1:33:31] on you can't leave the principles until
[1:33:34] you lay the principles right amen you're
[1:33:37] hanging your your thing in the sky
[1:33:42] hook that's why these doctrines won't
[1:33:44] fit that's what I told my wife the other
[1:33:47] day I said thank
[1:33:48] God that you can know the truth and the
[1:33:52] truth has kept you from going into
[1:33:55] error you don't never thank him for
[1:33:58] that oh bless God I kep
[1:34:01] say I don't agree with
[1:34:03] that cuz I know too much about the devil
[1:34:06] and how tricky he
[1:34:09] is but you see what most people think is
[1:34:13] the Christian thing is is even down
[1:34:16] below the principles that Paul is
[1:34:20] bringing and should not even have to be
[1:34:23] talked on other than
[1:34:26] newcomers and
[1:34:29] newcomers you know it's kind of odd
[1:34:30] around here that I don't preach on that
[1:34:32] all the time and we get
[1:34:35] newcomers and they come
[1:34:38] in sh and and they go get a
[1:34:41] [Laughter]
[1:34:44] haircut and nobody had said nothing here
[1:34:47] about it now I don't know where boing
[1:34:48] them or not but none of us didn't say
[1:34:51] nothing about it had a big old here ring
[1:34:52] in his ear
[1:34:54] I didn't say a word to
[1:35:00] him but you know what all you got to do
[1:35:02] just walk around and look
[1:35:05] right you say
[1:35:07] well that must be the dress code right
[1:35:12] right that must be the dress
[1:35:15] code so I need to dress like
[1:35:20] that that's not even Christianity his
[1:35:26] sister used to live back here I she's
[1:35:31] passed him she came
[1:35:34] here when the word said to
[1:35:37] her brother Mo pretty well like I am he
[1:35:40] didn't preach a lot on stuff he just
[1:35:41] tried to preach the Bible she came here
[1:35:44] one night she went back home she got her
[1:35:48] snuff
[1:35:49] box and she opened that Li up and she's
[1:35:53] d get in there cuz of what she used to
[1:35:56] doing she's a good old Baptist you know
[1:35:58] where they all get stuff and smok and
[1:36:02] things she said it made her
[1:36:05] sick had nobody preached against
[1:36:08] it it made her sick she said God if
[1:36:11] that's you and you want me to get rid of
[1:36:13] that to take away all the problems and
[1:36:14] needs and all she set the snuff box up
[1:36:17] on the
[1:36:18] fallboard you know how most of us are
[1:36:22] put them cigarettes man how many times
[1:36:24] you ever took them out the pocket now I
[1:36:26] never did smoke so I don't how many
[1:36:28] times yall ever take them out of your
[1:36:29] pocket sling them down across the field
[1:36:31] throw them in the trash can stop on and
[1:36:33] say I won't smoke another one and you
[1:36:36] headed to the
[1:36:39] store right you headed to buy some a got
[1:36:44] nothing you
[1:36:45] want
[1:36:47] see and everybody says well throw them
[1:36:50] away you know what I've always told you
[1:36:52] Brothers
[1:36:54] never talk sister about smoking cuz I
[1:36:56] had no problem with it but and I tell
[1:36:58] you same thing you know what to do with
[1:37:02] them just put them in your pocket and
[1:37:04] carry them around
[1:37:05] right saves you a lot of trouble exactly
[1:37:08] right cuz you ain't going to have to go
[1:37:10] buy no more that's right you got it
[1:37:13] handy right she set it up on the
[1:37:16] faboard sat there for months and months
[1:37:19] he finally throw it
[1:37:21] away that's the way you do it no nobody
[1:37:23] had never condemned her of a
[1:37:27] thing we don't believe in that kind of a
[1:37:29] doing though do
[1:37:31] [Music]
[1:37:33] we so I believe in God condemning you
[1:37:37] amen and then it'll work
[1:37:39] right right but
[1:37:42] he okay get off that get to Med but now
[1:37:45] listen you understand I'm going to quit
[1:37:47] right
[1:37:50] there leaving the principles Paul says
[1:37:54] so then what most of people claim to be
[1:37:57] the message of the hour the quote that's
[1:38:00] going to take us in the Rapture Etc is
[1:38:03] not even
[1:38:05] preaching in any
[1:38:08] form on the
[1:38:10] principles that Paul said for us to
[1:38:18] leave you see
[1:38:20] folks you think I like to talk like that
[1:38:23] I know
[1:38:26] I have to live with
[1:38:31] myself I got enough
[1:38:37] problems I got enough
[1:38:39] troubles I have to live
[1:38:42] myself that's why I don't have no big
[1:38:45] thing of beating on you about
[1:38:48] something I do everything I can to try
[1:38:50] to get you in some way to see it without

[1:39:30] K cuz you didn't get
[1:39:33] delivered listening last night not for
[1:39:36] last one you know in the truck I guess
[1:39:40] where brother Randon was explaining
[1:39:42] about the
[1:39:44] U the girl that he had went to pray for
[1:39:47] her she was real beautiful she was in a
[1:39:50] some kind of
[1:39:51] a what you call it nothing house and uh

[1:40:02] her he said he got down and
[1:40:05] said they prayed and he
[1:40:08] prayed said she had told him just before
[1:40:10] then said brother Bram said many times
[1:40:13] said I tried to straighten up and do
[1:40:15] what was
[1:40:16] right I said I just couldn't do
[1:40:19] it he said well let's just pray she got
[1:40:22] down she prayed she got up said well

[1:40:55] no more trouble with that

[1:41:02] think he said making somebody a
[1:41:03] beautiful
[1:41:05] wife because she prayed

[1:43:07] give us this day our daily
[1:43:09] bread we keep rising to one day like I
[1:43:14] said about
[1:43:16] Enoch Enoch walked up that pyramid until
[1:43:19] he just went out the top and he just
[1:43:21] went on up in the air
[1:43:27] that may be the way we're going to do
[1:43:28] walk right up through the
[1:43:32] skies brother Mo used to illustrate it
[1:43:34] he said I don't think the life step is
[1:43:36] going to be a great big one you know you
[1:43:37] got to run and get ready jump no just be
[1:43:40] another
[1:43:42] step one more step amen but don't step
[1:43:46] brother R Dalton had a dream and brother
[1:43:50] Brown told him he had a dream that like
[1:43:53] stoned out in the water and you know
[1:43:55] when they first would come up they would
[1:43:56] be real slick you know in the natural
[1:43:59] you know it would be moss and slick on
[1:44:02] and said he saw in a dream that he would
[1:44:05] it would come
[1:44:07] up and then he seen another you know
[1:44:11] just like that and he had to walk across
[1:44:12] this place and said brother random told
[1:44:14] him said brother do take one step at a
[1:44:18] time he said step on that
[1:44:21] stone but said don't quickly step on
[1:44:23] that next
[1:44:25] one he said because it' be slick he said
[1:44:29] Whit it
[1:44:31] dries and then you step over on
[1:44:35] it see that's the way to get
[1:44:37] across cuz once it dries you're
[1:44:41] safe let's just walk one step at a time
[1:44:44] okay let's go into the
[1:44:47] communion for I have received of the
[1:44:49] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[1:44:51] you that the Lord Jesus the same night
[1:44:52] in which he was betrayed took bread and
[1:44:55] when he had given thanks he broke it and
[1:44:57] said take eat this is my body which is
[1:44:59] broken for you this doing remembrance of
[1:45:02] me after the same manner also he took
[1:45:04] the cup when he had s saying this cup is
[1:45:06] the New Testament in my blood this do
[1:45:09] you as often as you drink it in
[1:45:10] remembrance of me for as often as you
[1:45:12] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:45:14] sh the Lord's death till he come
[1:45:16] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:45:18] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:45:19] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:45:22] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:45:24] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:45:25] that bread and drink of that cup for he
[1:45:27] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:45:29] eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself
[1:45:31] not Discerning the Lord's body for this
[1:45:34] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:45:36] and many sleep for if we we would judge
[1:45:40] ourselves we should not be judged but
[1:45:43] when we are judged we are chastened of
[1:45:45] the Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:45:47] with the world wherefore my brethren
[1:45:49] when you come together to eat t one for
[1:45:51] another and if any man hunger let him
[1:45:53] meat at home that you come not together
[1:45:56] you come not together in condemnation
[1:45:58] the rest will I set in order when I come
[1:46:01] let's just do as the prophet said let's
[1:46:03] just have a few moments of Silent prayer
[1:46:05] praying one for the other and especially
[1:46:07] you praying for me is what he said pray
[1:46:09] for you Pastor before we go into this
[1:46:11] let's get all minds and hearts
[1:46:14] clear to where that we can stand before
[1:46:16] God

[1:46:48] and blessed it father we thank you for
[1:46:50] this bread It's Made for This purpose
[1:46:52] today that we may be able to partake of
[1:46:56] these things we pray that you would just
[1:46:58] sanctify the bread and the partakers
[1:47:00] that we may all be together as one in
[1:47:02] you we know this is not your body it is
[1:47:05] only in
[1:47:06] representation we don't believe it
[1:47:08] becomes the literal because we're not
[1:47:10] concerned about it but it does represent
[1:47:14] you Lord sanctify the bread and the
[1:47:17] partakers in Jesus name amen
[1:47:43] I like to break all of it
[1:47:45] CU it was a broken
[1:47:48] body and that way then
[1:47:51] we we know know for assurity what it
[1:47:54] represents we don't hold it over we try
[1:47:57] to burn the bread and everything before
[1:47:59] another day transmits
[1:48:02] because we don't want to believe that
[1:48:04] we're trying to hold over we want the
[1:48:06] bread each day you say well we got this
[1:48:09] message a lot of people quit taking
[1:48:11] communion because they believe that
[1:48:13] brother Brandon brought the message and
[1:48:15] that ended that I don't believe it that
[1:48:16] way I believe that we're still to take
[1:48:18] it until he comes is what he said father
[1:48:21] we ask you to same s ify this wine we
[1:48:24] thank you that you Lord are the the one
[1:48:27] that would reveal it unto us what this
[1:48:28] is all
[1:48:29] about bless the wine
[1:48:32] Sanctified and Lord Jesus as we eat the
[1:48:35] little piece of bread and we drink this
[1:48:36] wine tomorrow that will make blood cells
[1:48:39] in our body that we could live by it
[1:48:41] Lord how much more would it make in us
[1:48:44] to make the revelation of the hour that
[1:48:46] we're living in the time we love you and
[1:48:49] we thank you thank you Father wine and
[1:48:52] and the bread and all of us together is
[1:48:54] one in you in Jesus name

[1:49:09] I by the
[1:49:12] river I'll
[1:49:15] [Music]
[1:49:23] carry my cross through the
[1:49:29] midnight come
[1:49:31] morning there's
[1:49:34] glory
[1:49:35] [Music]
[1:49:37] for sometimes I'm
[1:49:41] despised and
[1:49:44] rejected and I
[1:49:46] question oh
[1:49:49] Father how
[1:49:53] then I take one more
[1:49:57] look at Mount
[1:50:00] Calvary
[1:50:03] and strength to go
[1:50:07] on come
[1:50:10] morning I
[1:50:12] walk by the
[1:50:16] river I'll rest me the Ever Green
[1:50:30] [Music]
[1:50:40] Glory I never take the communion that I
[1:50:42] don't think about the children of Israel
[1:50:45] in their last night you know they they
[1:50:47] had a natural meal just like the
[1:50:49] disciples GA they had a natural meal at
[1:50:51] the eight
[1:50:53] but then at the end of
[1:50:55] it there was things back there they done
[1:50:58] that would be a typ and things and
[1:51:00] shadows you know and probably didn't
[1:51:02] understand the way they were doing but
[1:51:04] and it did it would represent what the
[1:51:05] Lord Jesus because when
[1:51:08] it come to the end of it then
[1:51:12] he he took the bread blessed it took the
[1:51:16] wine blessed
[1:51:17] it and he said this is the New Testament
[1:51:20] in my blood you know
[1:51:24] right then he was setting in order
[1:51:27] something that would be
[1:51:29] real something that would be you
[1:51:32] know in the correct
[1:51:36] order but then 2000 years we've been
[1:51:39] taking
[1:51:40] communion but one of these days when
[1:51:42] it's all over with and we get on the
[1:51:44] other
[1:51:48] side you know what the marriage supper
[1:51:50] is going to be the
[1:51:53] communion that' be something would it
[1:51:57] will we be in a hurry to go home you
[1:51:59] know well now brother Dale hurry it up
[1:52:03] because it's about 7 minutes till
[1:52:06] 4 we got to hurry up and go home it
[1:52:09] won't be any of those problems then will
[1:52:11] it we'll have eternity that we can
[1:52:14] take take one
[1:52:17] communion be a wonderful
[1:52:20] time wonderful hour don't don't ask me
[1:52:22] to explain it because I thought see we
[1:52:24] already had it in our idea that that the
[1:52:26] former things would be passed away you
[1:52:28] know we wouldn't remember nothing we do
[1:52:30] anything brother Rand said you know what
[1:52:32] would happen we'd be sitting at the at
[1:52:34] the marriage supper at the
[1:52:36] table he said we' realized it maybe so
[1:52:39] and so made it and he said Jesus would
[1:52:41] come down through and wipe the tears out
[1:52:44] of our
[1:52:47] eyes that won be tears of Sorrow will it
[1:52:51] be tears of joy
[1:52:53] a lot of difference in it in let's
[1:52:55] partake
[1:53:06] together you can be seated for a minute
[1:53:08] when
[1:53:09] we get ready to do the foot
[1:53:15] washing we read from
[1:53:19] John 13th chapter and verse 2
[1:53:24] supper being ended the devil having now
[1:53:25] put into the heart of Judas his carrot
[1:53:27] Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing
[1:53:30] that the father had given all things
[1:53:32] into his hands and that he was come from
[1:53:33] God and went to God he riseth from
[1:53:36] supper and laid aside his garments and
[1:53:38] took a towel and GED
[1:53:40] himself after that he poured water into
[1:53:42] a basin and began to wash the disciples
[1:53:44] feet and to wipe them with a towel
[1:53:45] wherewith he was GED then cometh he to
[1:53:48] Simon Peter and Peter Sith unto him Lord
[1:53:50] Dost thou wash my feet J Jesus answered
[1:53:53] and said unto him what I do thou knowest
[1:53:54] not now but Thou shalt know
[1:53:57] Hereafter Peter Sith unto him Thou shalt
[1:53:59] never wash my feet Jesus answered him if
[1:54:03] I wash thee not thou Hast no part with
[1:54:05] me Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my
[1:54:08] feet only but also my hands and my head
[1:54:11] Jesus said unto him he that is washed
[1:54:13] needeth not saved to wash his feet but
[1:54:17] is clean every with and you are clean
[1:54:19] but not all for he knew who should

[1:54:28] and taken his garments and was sat down
