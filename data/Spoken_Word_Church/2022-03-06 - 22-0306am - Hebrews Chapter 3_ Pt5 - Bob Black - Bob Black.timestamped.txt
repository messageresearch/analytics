[0:01] god bless you saints
[0:06] we're gonna try something a little
[0:07] different this morning try to see if i
[0:09] can
[0:10] can run the slideshow
[0:14] so hopefully
[0:24] all right
[0:26] let's let's just pray before we get into
[0:28] this lord god we're so grateful to be
[0:30] able to gather together around your word
[0:32] and we just pray lord as we study these
[0:33] things out lord that you'll just open
[0:35] these things to us
[0:36] lord bless brother wade as he studies
[0:38] lord and be with us today we ask in your
[0:40] name
[0:43] so
[0:45] let's let's kind of summarize the uh
[0:48] uh you know
[0:49] when you're when you're studying out
[0:50] scriptures you can uh you you almost
[0:53] like you're looking for patterns you're
[0:54] looking for these little nuggets
[0:56] so let's just kind of backtrack a little
[0:57] bit and and just kind of look at um the
[0:59] pattern that paul's laying out for us as
[1:01] we went through these first three
[1:02] chapters and getting on into chapter
[1:04] four
[1:05] so paul in
[1:06] hebrews chapter one he laid out you know
[1:08] that that who who christ is who this man
[1:11] was that began to speak and he said who
[1:13] bringing the brightness of his glory and
[1:14] the express image of his person
[1:17] and upholding all things by the word of
[1:19] his power when he had by himself purged
[1:21] our sins
[1:22] sat down on the right hand of the
[1:23] majesty on high and we know god has god
[1:26] has that he has a throne in heaven he
[1:28] sat down on the throne of christ when
[1:30] christ was on the earth and then on the
[1:32] day of pentecost peter preached those
[1:34] words that the lord said unto my lord
[1:37] sit down on my right hand until i make
[1:38] all my enemies that footstool as as
[1:41] christ sat down the holy ghost sat down
[1:43] in the heart of the believer
[1:45] so now look look at the pattern that
[1:46] paul is laying out for us in hebrews
[1:48] chapter 3 verse 8 harden not your hearts
[1:50] is in the provocation now they're on a
[1:52] journey
[1:53] don't harden your now we're on a journey
[1:55] don't don't harden your heart like they
[1:56] did as they were on that journey harden
[1:58] out your hearts as in the provocation of
[2:00] the day of temptation in the wilderness
[2:03] and in hebrews chapter four verse one
[2:05] hebrews chapter come on in be welcome
[2:08] we're just doing a little sunday school
[2:12] no problem at all
[2:14] we've got plenty of plenty of room
[2:16] plenty of spots to sit
[2:19] so hebrews chapter 4 verse 1. begins to
[2:22] talk about the rest let us therefore
[2:24] fear
[2:25] lest a promise being left left of left
[2:27] us of entering into his rest any of you
[2:30] should seem to come short of it so
[2:32] what's look at this look at this uh the
[2:34] pattern that paul is laying out for us
[2:35] you got a starting point you've got a
[2:37] journey on a journey let's not get hung
[2:39] up in our journey don't provoke god like
[2:41] they did in the wilderness
[2:42] which prevented them from entering into
[2:44] the rest
[2:45] so if you kind of set that pattern in
[2:47] your mind what we're talking about is is
[2:49] we're all you know that's why you know
[2:51] you begin to meditate on
[2:53] how the most most
[2:55] the majority of your christian life
[2:57] is spent on this journey
[2:59] and you're you're going you're trying to
[3:01] get somewhere what and begin to think
[3:03] about that one as we get to hebrews
[3:04] chapter four talking about rest what
[3:06] what really is rest now we know rest is
[3:09] the baptismal ghost and rest is when you
[3:11] seize from your own works and it's
[3:12] christ doing the work in you
[3:14] but maybe maybe begin to think about
[3:17] think about where did your rest come
[3:18] from
[3:21] so what provocation the provocation is
[3:23] kind of the main thought that we're on
[3:24] right now is provocation is when you you
[3:27] do something that makes somebody annoyed
[3:29] or angry
[3:31] so in this case you know
[3:32] i i keep going back to you know if you
[3:34] just believe somebody's word if you if
[3:36] somebody tells you they're going to do
[3:37] something for you are going to makes a
[3:39] promise to you and then you say i
[3:41] i just don't believe that my what a
[3:42] insult that is and think about how
[3:44] compounded that is for god to make
[3:46] promises to us the promise of the
[3:48] baptism in the holy ghost to promise
[3:49] that the seals will be open to us the
[3:51] promise that uh that he will reveal to
[3:53] us what our purpose is in this life that
[3:55] promised that he'll place us all those
[3:57] things and for us to draw back and say
[3:59] well you know i don't believe that god
[4:01] is able to deliver all of those goliaths
[4:03] into our hand i don't i don't believe
[4:05] i'd rather go back to where i started
[4:07] from
[4:07] now so we left off
[4:10] in our last lesson we left off at
[4:12] the 10th provocation which if at this
[4:15] place in the story in the bible
[4:17] the bible that uh moses and god actually
[4:20] he says that there's been 10
[4:22] provocations that lays out 10 and that
[4:24] at this point in the story there were 10
[4:26] so the 10th provocation is here they are
[4:28] at kedesh barnea now if you want to know
[4:30] what kiddish barnea looks like this is a
[4:32] picture of that spot
[4:34] and so so picture the children of israel
[4:36] coming up from and of course you know
[4:38] it's of course debatable exactly how
[4:40] they came up from egypt and where they
[4:42] crossed over the red sea and and those
[4:44] kind of things but we know that kiddish
[4:45] barnea was right there at the southern
[4:47] part of israel on this map right here
[4:49] and you think about
[4:51] a little narrow strip of land right
[4:53] there in a little valley and there they
[4:55] were
[4:57] at this at this junction place and they
[4:59] sent spies that traveled all across oh
[5:02] they start started from the southern tip
[5:03] and went all the way across all all up
[5:06] through the northern part of israel
[5:08] exploring everywhere and they came back
[5:10] and only two had a good report only two
[5:12] came back saying
[5:14] let's put it in today's today's
[5:15] vernacular the only two came back saying
[5:17] god is able to reveal these mysteries to
[5:19] us god is able to reveal the entire
[5:21] bible to us god is able to fulfill all
[5:23] of his promises to us the seals are open
[5:27] god is able to change our bodies god is
[5:29] able to to give us to unfold to us the
[5:32] full mystery of redemption
[5:34] god is able to reveal these things to us
[5:36] and the rest of them said well you know
[5:38] there's too many goliaths in the lands
[5:39] there's bullying preachers there's
[5:41] preachers that look like they're uh
[5:43] there's there's a lot of strange things
[5:45] that i don't know where we're gonna be
[5:46] able to
[5:47] to to overcome there's problems in our
[5:49] lives and you know you hear people in
[5:50] the message say well i don't know how
[5:52] we'll ever be perfect not realizing that
[5:54] this gospel is get sent to to change us
[5:56] into his likeness
[5:58] i don't know how we'll ever do it i
[5:59] don't know how we'll ever overcome and
[6:01] so that's the that's the junction time
[6:03] that they came to in this little spot
[6:05] in the middle of the desert
[6:09] so the tenth the tenth place now now
[6:11] brother brown was in the message abs and
[6:12] absolutely he said now you pentecostal
[6:14] people believe when the gifts began to
[6:15] restore to the church of the baptism of
[6:17] the holy ghost and speaking with tongues
[6:19] and you stayed right with that you
[6:20] believe that now that's all right but
[6:22] why do you stop there
[6:24] why do you stop there when israel was on
[6:26] the journey to the promised land and
[6:28] when they stopped in the wilderness they
[6:30] stayed there for 40 years and just a
[6:32] day's journey out of every promise the
[6:35] whole complete promised land
[6:39] so why do they not go into the promised
[6:40] land because they disbelieve god's word
[6:43] and that's the same that's the same
[6:44] question as opposed to us that we
[6:45] believe god's word do we believe that
[6:47] god is able to open up all these
[6:48] mysteries to us to believe do we believe
[6:50] what brother brown said
[6:52] do we stumble at the things that he
[6:53] spoke now see that's that's that that
[6:56] that that wilderness journey
[6:58] you're fighting it out because when you
[7:00] come to rest you're not fighting anymore
[7:03] you're resting
[7:05] there's you you look at that pattern
[7:06] that's being played out you start on
[7:08] your journey and you're wrestling with
[7:09] it
[7:10] why why do the preachers get seem to get
[7:12] so critical of that doctrine over there
[7:14] why do they why do they when they put a
[7:16] chart up on the screen and they point
[7:17] out problems with the chart why why do
[7:20] all these things because you're battling
[7:22] it out you're battling it out in your
[7:23] mind
[7:24] and then when you come to when you come
[7:26] to rest you're at a different place
[7:31] now here they came to they came to this
[7:33] junction time and the way they provoked
[7:34] god was they said they said one to
[7:35] another let us make a captain
[7:38] and let us return into egypt then moses
[7:40] and aaron fell on their faces before all
[7:42] the assembly of the congregation of the
[7:44] children of israel
[7:45] and joshua the son of nun and caleb the
[7:47] son of jafana which were of them that
[7:49] searched the land rent their clothes
[7:51] they rent their clothes because the
[7:52] people began to they
[7:54] you think about the confession they were
[7:57] they so doubted the message that had
[7:59] been given to them
[8:01] that they failed to believe that they
[8:02] were able to go over into the promise
[8:04] now again what's the promised land the
[8:05] promised land
[8:07] is your rest the promised land is the
[8:09] opening of the word the promised land it
[8:11] is the baptism of the holy ghost the
[8:13] promised land is uh is
[8:17] is everything now you think about what a
[8:19] paradox the rest is too that when they
[8:20] get over there into that land of rest
[8:23] they're still going to be fighting
[8:25] what a strange thing that is that you'll
[8:27] be resting but there's still goliaths
[8:28] and candy nights and and
[8:30] moabites and things that drive out of
[8:32] the land what a strange thing
[8:35] we'll talk about that more maybe
[8:37] and they spake unto all the company of
[8:39] the children of israel saying the land
[8:40] which we pass through to search it is an
[8:42] exceeding good land if the lord delight
[8:44] in us then he will bring us into this
[8:45] land and give it to us a land which
[8:47] floweth with milk and honey there
[8:49] there's a good confession
[8:51] that joshua and caleb had
[8:53] god is able to open up these mysteries
[8:55] to us
[8:56] and when you when you start when you
[8:57] when you sit in church and you kind of
[8:59] get all bogged down and you start
[9:00] thinking well i'll never understand this
[9:02] no don't
[9:04] don't you keep keep pressing on
[9:05] sometimes you got to get desperate get
[9:07] to a place where i i got to get it if my
[9:09] life depends on it
[9:12] only rebel not ye against the lord
[9:14] neither fear you the people of the land
[9:15] for they are bred for us their defense
[9:17] is departed from them and the lord is
[9:19] with us fear them not but all the
[9:21] congregation baits stoned them with
[9:22] stones
[9:24] and that was the third time moses
[9:25] interceded for the people because god
[9:27] just wanted he said i'm just gonna wipe
[9:28] wipe this lake clean i'm just gonna
[9:30] start fresh with you moses
[9:32] and moses laid before god and said don't
[9:34] don't do that and and you watch how many
[9:36] times moses does this he lays because
[9:38] he's playing the part of christ and he
[9:40] intercedes for the peace he's standing
[9:42] standing in the gap stand between
[9:44] god's wrath
[9:47] and so now now again i know i know last
[9:50] time i mentioned the the labor of
[9:52] ministers and the labor of pastors and i
[9:54] just want to highlight this again
[9:56] because now think about think about this
[9:58] now we read last time 75 percent of
[10:00] pastors report being extremely stressed
[10:02] or highly stressed 90 work between 55 to
[10:05] 75 hours per week
[10:07] many report a serious conflict with a
[10:09] parishioner at least once a month why
[10:11] why is it now i'm not saying this just
[10:13] to be like that sounds like a very downy
[10:16] statistic to quote that's depressing
[10:18] brother bob but the reason for this is
[10:20] because think about this you're in that
[10:22] stage you're under that ox anointing
[10:25] you're laboring and you're moving on
[10:27] you're moving on to your rest and so
[10:29] that's why that's why troubles come is
[10:32] because you're back you're battling and
[10:33] you're wrestling and the people are
[10:34] wrestling the people are wrestling with
[10:36] the things that are said the minister is
[10:38] going through
[10:39] we're we're we're in that that ox stage
[10:42] of moving on toward that rest
[10:45] and so it's it's it's it is it's part of
[10:48] the journey it's part of the journey for
[10:50] there to be battles as part of the
[10:51] journey for there to be battles that
[10:52] ministers meetings where where people
[10:54] have differences opinions and and people
[10:56] grapple and struggle and things as part
[10:58] of the battle for when preachers preach
[11:00] that people in the congregation that
[11:02] wonder what's being said and they and it
[11:03] start just like at bible study when you
[11:05] when you say things that it stirs up you
[11:07] you want to go home and let me study
[11:08] that out more because you're you're like
[11:11] an ox pulling that cart you're laboring
[11:13] and you're struggling and you're trying
[11:15] to get to where you're going
[11:19] and and and brother brown explained this
[11:21] in hebrews chapter four when he was
[11:23] preaching the sermon hebrews chapter
[11:24] four he said they got weary
[11:26] every time they get to a place where a
[11:28] showdown come
[11:29] then what would they do they would fly
[11:31] loose
[11:32] and get weary and want to turn back and
[11:35] why did this happen to me
[11:37] why do these bad problems come because
[11:39] you're you're in a journey it's part of
[11:41] the journey
[11:42] part of the journey it's not going to be
[11:44] a flower bed of roses to it where all
[11:46] the all the understanding just dumped
[11:48] out you on you all at once and you just
[11:50] you just understand
[11:52] because god is god's given you a little
[11:54] bit more as you as he as your character
[11:56] is molding and he begins to realize that
[11:58] that you're gonna what you're gonna do
[11:59] with it and and and and it's it's it's
[12:03] it's part of the journey
[12:04] now the the eleventh provocation
[12:08] core the son of ishar the son of kohath
[12:10] the son of levi and daythan and
[12:12] ambayaram the sons of
[12:13] eliah and on the son of peleth sons of
[12:15] reuben took me in and there rose up
[12:17] before moses
[12:18] was certain of the children of israel
[12:20] 250 princes of the assembly famous in
[12:23] the congregation men are renowned
[12:25] and they gathered themselves together
[12:27] against moses and aaron and said unto
[12:29] them you take too much upon you seeing
[12:31] all the congregation are holy
[12:33] every one of them
[12:34] and the lord is among them wherefore
[12:36] then lift ye up yourselves above the
[12:38] congregation of the lord
[12:40] now brother brown compare this that you
[12:42] know ministers and things that they get
[12:44] lifted up within themselves and they
[12:45] begin to say well we don't have to
[12:47] believe the messenger for our day now
[12:49] now notice that
[12:50] you can get so tied up with what
[12:52] hollywood says hollywood the ten
[12:54] commandments movie will make the ground
[12:56] opening up that they'll put that scene
[12:58] when moses went up to get the ten
[12:59] commandments off of the mountain but but
[13:02] really that happened much later
[13:04] see how you you you you need to go back
[13:07] to the bible and study things out to
[13:09] really get the complete picture you
[13:10] can't can't rely on just watching a
[13:12] little movie or uh all there's so many
[13:14] little different television shows and
[13:15] things that get things so blatantly
[13:17] wrong
[13:18] and so hollywood is not our bible the
[13:20] bible the bible is our bible
[13:24] and so in numbers chapter 16 verse 32 it
[13:26] says in the earth open her mouth and
[13:28] swallow them up in all their houses and
[13:30] all the men that i pertained in decorah
[13:32] and all their goods now now brother ram
[13:34] said and why i'm against organized
[13:36] religion why did he tell this story and
[13:38] why i'm against organized religion
[13:40] he said he told them to take sensors
[13:42] that moses did and put holy fire in it
[13:44] and put the incense over the top of it
[13:45] and to wave this holy incense which is
[13:47] the command of god and they come up to
[13:49] make a group of men to control the
[13:51] church where god had commanded one man
[13:54] to do so one man what does that mean
[13:57] that means that everything we preach and
[13:59] everything we stand for comes from comes
[14:01] from the gospel that was preached by
[14:03] that one man in this age just like in
[14:05] every other age in paul's days there was
[14:07] one man that stood for the god the word
[14:10] that for that age and everybody had to
[14:12] everybody's message all the ministers in
[14:14] that age their message had to dovetail
[14:15] with that
[14:16] so we're preaching we're preaching not
[14:18] our own ideas and he wasn't even
[14:19] preaching his own idea but he was
[14:21] preaching a message straight from the
[14:22] throne of god and so we all dovetail
[14:24] with that which dovetails with the bible
[14:27] every we know that everything that
[14:28] brother and preached dovetails with what
[14:30] paul preached
[14:31] and so he said they failed to see that
[14:33] moses was the messenger of that hour see
[14:36] he had thus saith the lord there was
[14:38] nobody on earth like him he had the
[14:40] message and the people failed to see it
[14:42] and moses was exactly what thus saith
[14:45] the lord
[14:46] he said now we find the same thing today
[14:48] good men great men precious men trying
[14:50] to preach the word of god
[14:52] in their hand through some man-made
[14:54] tradition cutting out here and cutting
[14:56] down here and making it this and come
[14:58] join the church and change your
[14:59] membership and spiritually die with that
[15:02] word in their hand
[15:04] so they went so they went uh god moses
[15:06] told them go take the incense take that
[15:08] incense in their hand and they went and
[15:10] they went to minister before the before
[15:12] the tabernacle and god said separate
[15:14] yourselves from those people
[15:16] now now watch out watch this pattern
[15:18] that god told god told moses just i'm
[15:20] going to wipe again he said i'm going to
[15:22] wipe the slate clean and start over with
[15:24] you and moses laid before the lord and
[15:26] prayed and god that's when god told him
[15:28] to
[15:29] go uh
[15:32] uh send aaron before
[15:34] before the people
[15:36] to um
[15:37] uh
[15:38] i'm getting my
[15:41] he laid before the lord and and god told
[15:43] him well to separate all the people and
[15:44] then that they caused the ground to open
[15:46] up
[15:47] now now watch watch after this happen
[15:50] as truly a supernatural event happened
[15:53] where the ground opened up and swallowed
[15:54] all those people that rebelled against
[15:56] moses and then the people what are the
[15:58] people that say they said
[16:00] all the congregation of the children of
[16:02] israel murmuring its moses and aaron
[16:04] saying ye have killed the people of the
[16:06] lord
[16:07] now see in this in this day you could
[16:09] say the same thing after we have seen
[16:11] after we have seen the pillar of fire
[16:13] and supernatural things done and still
[16:15] people turn aside turn around and fail
[16:17] to realize that god has done something
[16:19] supernatural
[16:20] in this day
[16:23] now we're almost we're almost to the to
[16:25] the to the 14th
[16:27] so when they finally they began to run
[16:29] out of water and they began to complain
[16:31] and and the people choked with moses and
[16:32] spake saying would god that we had died
[16:34] when our brethren died before the lord
[16:37] and why have you brought up the
[16:38] congregation of the lord into this
[16:39] wilderness that we and our cattle should
[16:41] die there
[16:43] and that's when moses temper got the
[16:44] best of him he got so upset that he
[16:47] smoked the rock now now you look at all
[16:49] these types and things where moses he
[16:51] broke the tab the tables of stone uh he
[16:53] broke them and then they had to be
[16:54] remade by god and
[16:56] he lost his temper here and he and he
[16:59] struck the rock again but
[17:01] and all these things actually types were
[17:03] being played out why did moses strike
[17:06] strike the tables of stone and they had
[17:07] to be remade because the word would be
[17:09] in its fullness at the beginning of the
[17:11] ephesian church age and then in its
[17:13] fullness in the last and so the word
[17:15] would would come back in its full power
[17:18] and and why did he strike why did he
[17:20] strike the rock because it actually had
[17:21] to be fulfilled then in the last age
[17:24] that the the the true gospel would be
[17:26] strict it would be smitten forth from
[17:28] the denominational ideas and they would
[17:30] reject it and that's why brother brown
[17:31] preached the message an indictment
[17:34] he said i indict you why for crucifying
[17:36] afresh the son of god for crucifying the
[17:39] word made flesh again god coming back in
[17:42] his people and being manifested visibly
[17:44] with the pillar of fire and the word
[17:45] being preached
[17:46] so but but yet moses his temper got the
[17:49] best of him and he struck that rock and
[17:51] and god said you can't go into the
[17:53] promised land now you think think now
[17:56] moses he didn't lose his eternal life
[17:58] but he lost going into that into the end
[18:01] of that journey
[18:02] he lost
[18:03] just just like how you and i it would
[18:06] get a deep water a little bit but if we
[18:08] fail to get these virtues how are we
[18:11] going to come to a place of adoption if
[18:13] you don't have temperance if you don't
[18:15] have patience if you don't if you don't
[18:17] struggle it out and and work out what's
[18:20] true and what's correct work out your
[18:21] salvation with fear and trembling i
[18:23] heard somebody say the other day
[18:26] well now that we've all been adopted now
[18:28] that's a very weighty thing to say now
[18:30] that we've all been adopted
[18:32] that's that's that's a weighty thing to
[18:34] say be careful with that kind of
[18:35] statement because you got to have all
[18:37] these virtues in you to be to come to a
[18:39] place where god recognizes that his
[18:41] character is is in you and that you're
[18:43] doing you're you're believing his word
[18:45] and then to vindicate that by
[18:47] opening the seals to you and revealing
[18:49] himself to you and filling you with the
[18:51] true baptism of the holy ghost
[18:52] let's
[18:53] uh
[18:55] we're all on an individual journey we're
[18:56] not
[18:58] we're not we're not all coming to the
[18:59] end of the road i i've spoke to a
[19:01] minister years ago where you know some
[19:03] some people get this idea that as soon
[19:05] as you're born again in this age
[19:07] whatever age you're born again then
[19:09] you're at that place in the pyramid now
[19:11] we all start as a baby we all start as a
[19:13] little baby and we all grow and so we
[19:15] all have our own individual growth
[19:17] journey that we're on and just because
[19:19] we're all in this church just because
[19:20] we're all sitting here this morning does
[19:22] not mean that just because just because
[19:24] the ministers are preaching adoption
[19:25] doesn't mean we're all adopted
[19:28] doesn't mean does it just because uh
[19:30] just because uh
[19:32] martin luther was preaching
[19:33] justification didn't mean everybody that
[19:34] was sitting there listening to him
[19:36] understood what he was saying
[19:40] and the very last loathing the light
[19:41] bread
[19:43] and they journeyed from mount over by
[19:44] the way of the red sea to compass the
[19:46] land of edom and the soul of the people
[19:48] was much discouraged because of the way
[19:50] and the people spake against god and
[19:51] against moses wherefore have you brought
[19:53] us out of egypt to die in the wilderness
[19:56] for there is no bread neither is there
[19:58] any water and our soul loathes this
[20:00] light breath what what did they what
[20:02] were they loathing they were loathing
[20:05] let's put it in today's understanding
[20:07] they were loathing the deep teaching of
[20:09] the word
[20:10] they were loathing the mysteries being
[20:12] revealed they were loathing
[20:14] preaching about the promised land and
[20:16] what is the promised land the promised
[20:18] land is the message that brother branham
[20:20] was sent to bring in this day the
[20:22] promised land
[20:23] the the true the unfolding of the word
[20:27] and the lord sent fiery serpents among
[20:29] the people and they bit the people
[20:31] and much people of israel died
[20:36] which is why paul says harden not to
[20:37] your heart says in the provocation of
[20:39] the day of temptation in the wilderness
[20:41] when your fathers tempted me prove me
[20:43] and saw my works forty years
[20:46] wherefore i was grieved with that
[20:47] generation and said they do always air
[20:49] in their heart and they have not known
[20:51] my ways
[20:53] so i swear in my wrath
[20:55] they shall not enter into my rest
[20:58] take heed brethren lest there be in any
[21:00] of you an evil heart of unbelief and
[21:01] departing from the living god
[21:04] but exhort one another daily
[21:06] while it is called today
[21:08] lest any of you be hardened through the
[21:10] deceitfulness of sin
[21:13] for we are made partakers of christ if
[21:15] we hold the beginning of our confidence
[21:17] steadfast until the end
[21:19] while it is said today if you will hear
[21:21] his voice
[21:22] harden out your hearts as in the
[21:23] provocation for some when they had heard
[21:26] did provoke how be not all that came out
[21:28] of egypt by moses but with whom was he
[21:30] grieved 40 years
[21:32] was it not with them that had sinned
[21:34] whose carcasses fell in the wilderness
[21:37] and to whoms where he that they should
[21:39] not enter into his rest
[21:41] but to them that believe not
[21:43] so we see that they could not enter in
[21:46] because of unbelief
[21:48] now what happened to those that
[21:50] disbelieve
[21:51] now brother branham said and many
[21:53] sermons why it had to be shepherds he
[21:55] said
[21:56] there was only two of them that ever
[21:58] went through that was saved out of a two
[22:00] and a half million
[22:02] two out of two and a half million
[22:05] you see that you say that what happened
[22:06] to them they're eternally gone why
[22:09] because they did not believe the promise
[22:11] of god
[22:12] all of them brother branham
[22:15] jesus said so
[22:17] they said our fathers a manna in the
[22:19] wilderness and they drank from the rock
[22:22] and he jesus said and they are
[22:24] everyone dead
[22:27] eternally separated see everyone
[22:30] now let's let let's sit on that for a
[22:32] little bit now because that's a little
[22:33] bit deep
[22:36] brother brown said then souls are prison
[22:38] now
[22:39] and j saint john
[22:42] john 6 49 is where they eat manna and
[22:44] jesus said and they're everyone
[22:46] dead
[22:48] and he said well well my sister i seen
[22:50] this woman dance in the spirit i've seen
[22:52] them do that i've seen her speak in
[22:54] tongues jesus said many will come to me
[22:56] in that day
[22:57] and say i've done all these things
[22:59] i went to church i paid my tithes i was
[23:02] there in the in the building when they
[23:03] were preaching deep things they man in
[23:05] the wilderness jesus said and they're
[23:07] everyone eternally separated
[23:10] they're dead
[23:12] as eternally gone
[23:13] they perished
[23:15] right there
[23:16] in the wilderness
[23:18] and again as souls in prison now he said
[23:20] when the truth is presented to a person
[23:22] for the last time
[23:24] and they refuse to receive it
[23:26] according to the book of hebrews
[23:28] they are finished no repentance no
[23:30] redemption there is nothing left for
[23:32] them they are eternally separated
[23:35] the bible said so now you think about
[23:36] god gave them chance after chance 14 14
[23:40] times to test and see if they were going
[23:42] to believe
[23:44] the bible said so looking for the
[23:46] fearful fire and any nation which shall
[23:47] devour the adversary
[23:49] and when truth of the gospel has been
[23:51] proven
[23:52] thoroughly vindicated and then turn
[23:55] around and walk away from it they're
[23:57] finished
[23:58] that's all
[24:00] it's awful
[24:01] but i have to tell it now let's
[24:05] to really understand this i i think we
[24:07] have to you know brother brown when he
[24:08] was preaching the fifth seal he kind of
[24:10] he gave us a glimpse of this the lie
[24:12] that the devil told
[24:14] was thou shalt not surely die
[24:17] now now look at them as they went
[24:19] through that journey
[24:20] they were the place where
[24:22] obviously they believed the devil's lie
[24:25] they believed that well we're not going
[24:27] to die it's okay for us to just
[24:29] to reject the leadership of the holy
[24:31] spirit to reject all the supernatural
[24:33] things that we've seen
[24:35] and so that's what jesus said in john
[24:37] chapter 6 verily verily i say unto you
[24:39] he that believeth on me hath everlasting
[24:41] life
[24:42] i am that bread of life your fathers did
[24:44] eat man in the wilderness and are dead
[24:48] why because if you disbelieve god's word
[24:50] you will die
[24:52] in genesis but of the tree of the
[24:53] knowledge of the good and evil thou
[24:55] shalt not death not eat of it for in the
[24:57] day that thou eat is there thou shalt
[24:59] surely die and then the level told that
[25:01] the lie which brotherhood said the lie
[25:03] the lie
[25:05] is you will not surely die
[25:08] if you disbelieve god's word
[25:10] you'll not surely die now now what we
[25:12] want to examine this morning is how how
[25:14] that definition changes depending on
[25:16] where
[25:17] what does that mean does that mean look
[25:18] if you're born again and you fail you
[25:21] you begin to stumble at things and and
[25:23] you don't have all the gaps closed in
[25:26] the definition change a little bit
[25:28] if you die if you disbelieve a little
[25:30] thing
[25:32] you're you're you don't lose your
[25:33] eternal life if you're born again
[25:35] but it still holds true just like eve
[25:38] think about now
[25:39] adam and eve in the garden
[25:41] they just believed that god's word did
[25:44] they lose their eternal life
[25:46] but yet god's word is true and the day
[25:49] they disbelieved they died
[25:51] they died their begot their body began
[25:53] to start taking that downward turn and
[25:56] i'm i'm running out of time here
[25:59] well we got two minutes the musicians
[26:00] can go ahead and come forward
[26:02] brother around said in the message
[26:03] oneness he said now when adam and eve
[26:05] listen to the lie of the devil
[26:07] the holy image of god left them their
[26:10] fellowship was broken with god
[26:12] their fellowship with oneness with god
[26:14] was broken
[26:15] at the very minute they listened to the
[26:17] lie of the devil that broke their
[26:18] fellowship
[26:20] and the very minute that you listen to
[26:21] the live devil the devil it'll break
[26:23] your fellowship
[26:24] that's the very minute that you go out
[26:26] from the presence of god like she did is
[26:28] when you fail to take god's word
[26:30] just as it is
[26:32] and the next time we'll talk about rest
[26:34] because that's where we're leading to
[26:36] that's where paul was leading to was
[26:38] rest
[26:39] god bless you
[26:42] [Applause]
[26:57] [Music]
[27:23] you
