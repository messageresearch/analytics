[0:00] one had a wonderful holiday
[0:04] and the Lord was good to you
[0:07] and working now
[0:10] so now we've come to this is the
[0:13] last of the year last Sunday before the
[0:16] new year
[0:18] and all of you know that we're going to
[0:20] be doing the uh
[0:22] Jack your perfect man upstairs for at
[0:24] least for the month of January and maybe
[0:26] on the end of February so we'll see
[0:28] how that goes but just keep me in your
[0:30] prayer now you
[0:31] you all have had 68 sermon backgrounds
[0:35] so I want some amens and some I want
[0:39] that Sleepy's beard off of you
[0:45] no just because hey even teachers have
[0:49] to show up for school
[0:51] all right no you do not not have to come
[0:54] but you do have to
[0:56] not a little louder than the rest of
[0:58] them amen yeah it's not a little bit
[1:00] louder because we started we started
[1:03] this in September I mean in February of
[1:05] 2013. I did not know we started then but
[1:08] we had them of course we took some gaps
[1:09] one time and let other brothers do the
[1:12] second school class but I really enjoyed
[1:14] it but we got 68 here we've come up to
[1:16] brotherly kindness
[1:18] and we kind of we've hit on the Holy
[1:21] Spirit but we're not going to do this
[1:22] until we go upstairs and then when I
[1:25] come back downstairs maybe after I get
[1:27] back from the Philippines we'll start on
[1:29] the Capstone or the headstone
[1:31] but I want everybody to just kind of
[1:32] we're going to do a review today we're
[1:34] going to review it back through
[1:36] and uh
[1:37] take just a minute to expound on
[1:39] something that we've talked about but I
[1:41] want to read the quote so that you can
[1:42] see it so what we started with is we
[1:45] start with the foundation everybody
[1:46] knows faith is the foundation right
[1:48] right it's not that you got to have all
[1:51] these and then get the new birth up here
[1:53] that's not it that's not the new birth
[1:55] that's just Holy Spirit that's nothing
[1:56] new birth right the new birth is
[1:58] justification sanctification and puts
[2:00] you in line for these virtues because
[2:02] these virtues are Godly virtues they're
[2:04] not just virtues that uh you know you
[2:06] have a good temperament some some some
[2:08] guys you could slap them in the face and
[2:12] they would they would say okay that's
[2:13] not a problem and be just as sinful as
[2:15] the day is long now that's not godly
[2:17] Temperance right Godly Temperance is
[2:20] when you he brother Brown said you
[2:22] control your ungodly temper
[2:24] so you fly off the handle at somebody
[2:27] else then that's where the problem is
[2:29] going to be
[2:30] so we've come through this let's stay
[2:32] down here for a minute justification
[2:34] sanitation baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:36] Faith the Bible says add to your faith
[2:38] so it must be something you have to have
[2:39] you have to acquire this Faith all right
[2:42] when you acquire this Faith then God can
[2:45] add our birth into you virtue knowledge
[2:48] and professions guidance and brotherly
[2:49] kindness and then seal them by the Holy
[2:52] Spirit
[2:53] kind of like what brother Joel and I
[2:55] were talking this morning
[2:57] this is the token the baptismal Holy
[3:00] Ghost is a total right right it didn't
[3:02] just come in the end time that Holy
[3:04] Ghost
[3:05] let the Holy Ghost to seal these virtues
[3:07] in did come in the end times amen right
[3:10] because Martin Luther he could have had
[3:13] some of these but he never could have
[3:14] reached that Capstone
[3:16] he might have some of these virtues but
[3:18] never could have reached a Capstone
[3:19] nobody's reached that Capstone except
[3:21] the Lord Jesus Christ and brother
[3:23] Branham that we know of now that we can
[3:26] positively say because Jesus had to be
[3:29] the head he was The Headstone he didn't
[3:30] type The Headstone he was The Headstone
[3:32] all right and when he was rejected they
[3:35] took that off
[3:37] but man Through the Ages like brother
[3:39] Jewel and I were talking this morning
[3:40] man Through the Ages got the Holy Ghost
[3:43] right the true coat you're right there's
[3:45] never been a false token it's a trip
[3:47] right
[3:48] Paul true talking Iranians but all these
[3:51] had to have the new birth to have people
[3:52] birthed underneath them right right
[3:55] that's right I mean your leaders got if
[3:56] your leader don't have a new birth you
[3:58] don't have a new birth right because you
[3:59] can only go as high as your leader all
[4:01] right so the leader came
[4:04] in bc4 was born Jesus Christ grew up the
[4:08] Bible says grew in Grace and knowledge
[4:12] but he had these verses in him because
[4:14] he was the Holy Ghost he didn't need the
[4:16] Holy Ghost he was the Holy Ghost right
[4:18] he didn't need
[4:19] kind of an anointing that came on him
[4:21] for his ministry is that right that's
[4:23] right right that was an anointing that
[4:25] came on him on the River Jordan he
[4:27] didn't need the Holy Ghost you and I
[4:28] need the Holy Ghost
[4:30] he didn't need it because he was there
[4:31] all right he was the fullness of the
[4:33] godhead Bible but there was an anointing
[4:35] that came on him that didn't make him a
[4:38] better person
[4:41] didn't make him a better person it put
[4:44] his ministry in place him becoming 30
[4:47] years old as a priest he had to come to
[4:50] that age to where he could handle the
[4:52] word see he had to type the word out
[4:54] exactly
[4:55] so it comes to the to the River Jordan
[4:57] and the Holy Ghost comes upon him and
[5:00] brother Brown said it was the anointing
[5:01] for his ministry so that's that three
[5:03] and a half year Ministry Now where's the
[5:04] three and a half year Ministry Jesus
[5:05] Christ sure it's in here
[5:08] yeah sure but it culminates right here
[5:10] right because he was ahead all his
[5:13] intelligence he had was the intelligence
[5:14] of God it wasn't the intelligence of man
[5:16] right right okay so he had the
[5:18] intelligence we'll see what did they do
[5:20] when they killed him they cut him off
[5:22] Isaiah 53 he was cut off from his
[5:25] generation he had no children
[5:28] right all right he had no children
[5:30] naturally our spiritual Jesus didn't
[5:31] save a person when he was on earth right
[5:33] right right he didn't save nobody the
[5:35] holy he wants to Holy Ghost he had the
[5:37] Holy Ghost so same way in the end time
[5:39] but you got to watch what you're doing
[5:42] because you can't say well you got to
[5:44] come up here and then get the Holy
[5:45] Spirit now you get the Holy Ghost here
[5:46] because you go you got to grow in Grace
[5:48] and always like he did but he was born
[5:50] right the first time we weren't
[5:53] all right we had to be born again we had
[5:56] to have a rebirth
[5:58] then Peter said Being Born Again being
[6:01] born again with these virtues birth in
[6:05] us being born again right right see how
[6:07] many times have I said that and you just
[6:08] got it
[6:09] I've said that for a year and a half but
[6:12] that's right
[6:16] Hey listen I don't care if it takes 10
[6:18] years as long as you get it it doesn't
[6:20] matter to me that's why I always heard
[6:22] quote the guy said you know what Jesus
[6:23] is not going to ask you when you go to
[6:25] heaven he's going to ask you how long
[6:27] you why did it take you so long to get
[6:28] saved that's right yeah
[6:32] say enter into the drug lord he
[6:33] knew when he was going to get saved
[6:34] right right you just didn't so we grow
[6:37] up into this then there's an anointing
[6:39] comes
[6:40] that's what we've been talking about we
[6:42] haven't hit that as an anointing but I
[6:43] want to hit it today as an anointing
[6:45] because I want to read something here in
[6:47] just a minute but we get right here
[6:49] watch let's read this quote 320 maybe
[6:51] statute perfect man now in building the
[6:53] virtue of building this Monument
[6:54] building this stature remember it's a
[6:57] stature not a statue all right a statue
[7:00] can't move a stature is a growth
[7:03] development or measurement all right it
[7:05] starts off with a foundation stone which
[7:07] is here now remember too the Head was
[7:10] made the Chief Cornerstone right right
[7:12] all right now here's the headstone he
[7:15] was cut off and rejected there was no
[7:17] man could attain to that that he had
[7:19] right right that's why brother Brown
[7:21] puts the typos the pyramids in Egypt
[7:23] they didn't put the top on it right but
[7:25] remember you take that pyramid as I
[7:27] shorter Brothers you take that pyramid
[7:30] yep
[7:31] and you put it right there
[7:34] there's your Cornerstone
[7:36] same pyramid right right you put the
[7:39] pyramid right in the corner he's the
[7:40] Chief Cornerstone so what what this is
[7:42] is this and it's pure form the true
[7:45] token right right or the fullness of the
[7:48] tokens that come in the end time was
[7:50] this Divine love right here see you
[7:52] received Divine love when you get the
[7:53] new birth
[7:54] there's not a love and then a Divine
[7:56] love if you get the love of God you hit
[7:58] the Divine love of God all right I mean
[8:00] it ain't but you grow though being a
[8:04] free moral agent you decide whether you
[8:06] go in let God in these doors maybe we
[8:08] spoke on doors and doors brother grandma
[8:11] said you let God in your house
[8:13] I said then you got a door right here of
[8:15] self-pride himself this and all that he
[8:17] said the Holy Ghost is a timid
[8:19] individual right only no it's just Timmy
[8:21] he won't just rush in your house to
[8:22] start opening doors right right he's
[8:25] very timid he's a gentleman brother
[8:27] Brown said now if he's saying now God I
[8:29] need you to go in that door he'll be
[8:30] glad to go in that door and take out
[8:32] your ungodly temper or your impatience
[8:35] with people
[8:36] but even a Christian you can say hey God
[8:38] I don't want you to go in that door
[8:39] right there God will say okay yes
[8:49] because I didn't know you would be on
[8:51] this yeah okay okay
[8:53] maybe we'll help each other but you come
[8:56] in here and that's what happens though
[8:58] see God's got this all this is for you
[9:00] it's in the Holy Ghost down here
[9:02] but we must as free moral agents we must
[9:06] let God continue to do these things in
[9:08] our life all right
[9:10] now when we get to right here
[9:14] right here it says all right you get all
[9:16] the we're talking about the purchase but
[9:17] I'm gonna run through this real quick
[9:18] you get all diverges say you got them
[9:20] all working in your life and you're just
[9:22] to a place where God can really use you
[9:25] all right you're just to a place where
[9:27] God can really really use you like you
[9:29] wanted to but now remember
[9:32] if I was saved many times before
[9:34] Paul had all these virtues right
[9:38] ireneas have these virtues Martin
[9:40] brogram said the first three Ages was
[9:41] the perfect age that white
[9:44] Church the real White Church
[9:47] because they have what one dog right
[9:49] they have water baptism around there and
[9:50] all the major doctrines they had right
[9:52] what happened was that man eroded down
[9:55] Through the Ages he wrote in the effects
[9:56] of the word right but the word was
[9:58] always there you can't kill the word
[10:00] right right but you can't hide
[10:02] right you can you can suppress it you
[10:04] could because like I said the Holy Ghost
[10:06] is a gentleman he said if you don't want
[10:07] that then I'm not going to give it to
[10:08] you right worm and all that eat it up
[10:10] right eat it all up in in here in these
[10:13] ages now what had to happen brother
[10:15] Brown had to come and give a word of
[10:17] restoration because nobody knew about
[10:19] these virtues surely might have been
[10:20] taught on by Martin Luther but surely
[10:23] surely Martin Luther didn't have a whole
[10:25] lot of godliness sitting in a pub
[10:27] drinking a beer that's right and smoking
[10:29] a
[10:30] piece because what happens is we're
[10:33] going to read it in just a minute power
[10:34] without character is satanic okay
[10:38] we've got the power
[10:43] the powers are Holy Ghost and then we've
[10:45] got a double dose of the power because
[10:47] see we got the Holy Ghost plus the
[10:49] perfect message of the hour we're
[10:51] currently like Elisha Elisha got a
[10:54] double portion of galadia right Elijah
[10:56] comes bring a message well we've got the
[10:58] Holy Ghost plus the message yeah these
[11:00] people only have the Holy Ghost and the
[11:02] message for their day which is partial
[11:03] word right they have part work down
[11:06] through here but when you come right
[11:08] here brother Branham had to be the one
[11:10] to stand and be so close to Jesus Christ
[11:13] where they thought he was
[11:15] okay I mean you look at the man's life
[11:17] okay so he The Headstone did come back
[11:21] in the end time bringing the true token
[11:25] but this right here had to be the
[11:27] ceiling part what sealed it together
[11:29] remember you got a head and a body if
[11:32] you don't have a neck to connect that
[11:34] right everything that goes on in your
[11:37] body goes through your neck
[11:39] that's right everyone everything that
[11:41] goes on in your body
[11:43] go through your neck
[11:45] it's not a head and nothing and in here
[11:48] no it's a complete brother Branson move
[11:51] we're moving breathing instrumentality
[11:52] of God so every the neck had to come to
[11:56] put the two together all right which is
[11:58] the Holy Spirit the anointing and the
[12:00] end time the same message that was on
[12:02] Jesus that come off of him in the
[12:04] Gethsemane right the anointing left him
[12:08] in Gethsemane because he couldn't die
[12:09] before that right he couldn't die with
[12:11] that preaching anointing on him
[12:13] that's what I mean if we ever see that
[12:15] we get that anointing back we can't die
[12:18] that's the anointing that will take us
[12:19] in a Rapture without death it's the same
[12:22] one because remember they wanted to
[12:23] Stone Jesus they backed him up against
[12:25] the cliff they did all these things to
[12:27] try to kill him during that three and a
[12:29] half year Ministry but remember he said
[12:31] he disappeared in the crowd where he
[12:33] walked through walked through the crowd
[12:34] remember he got out of that because he
[12:36] was in that three and a half year
[12:37] Ministry
[12:38] that perfect anointing of the perfect
[12:40] word
[12:41] because out of that three and a half
[12:43] year ministry that's where brother Brown
[12:45] brought his message he didn't bring it
[12:47] from anything different he brought it
[12:49] from that three and a half year Ministry
[12:50] of Jesus Christ all right so he brought
[12:52] it back to its profession tied the Loose
[12:55] Ends back together and then anointed it
[12:59] power
[13:02] and character right right see he brought
[13:05] power and character but Power without
[13:09] all this character put Martin Luther in
[13:12] a pub drinking a beer and smoking pot
[13:14] you say that satanic that was a satanic
[13:16] demon that made him do that God don't
[13:17] sit in them God knows that in the pub
[13:19] yeah
[13:21] but the part that was coming was that
[13:23] there was going to be a perfect
[13:24] character coming
[13:26] but Martin Luther had to play a part in
[13:28] that but he wasn't a full part of it
[13:30] right right so he could do that he could
[13:33] sit in a pub smoke a pot and drink a
[13:35] beer you know now in this day you can't
[13:37] do that all right because the word has
[13:39] moved on up higher and put us in an age
[13:42] to where I you know I I believe we're
[13:44] here I believe the whole headstone is
[13:46] here but as I've told her before Billy
[13:49] Joel a lot of people in message think
[13:51] they're right here just because they're
[13:52] in the message that's a special place
[13:55] right there
[13:56] that's a special place there's only a
[13:58] few people reach that place that I know
[14:00] what I'm telling you that we know of
[14:01] that scriptural and backed up by the
[14:04] message is William Brown and brother and
[14:06] Jesus Christ out of all the Millions
[14:09] of Christians in this world
[14:11] that's the only two that's a tangle X so
[14:13] that's not an easy place to get to it
[14:15] right yeah you've got to fight your way
[14:17] through it right hang on a minute you
[14:19] gotta fight your way through all this to
[14:21] get here this is not automatic just
[14:23] because you're in this church
[14:25] nobody understand that you start from
[14:28] the foundation and you work your way up
[14:30] just like brother I don't have to do the
[14:32] same thing he had to get born again
[14:34] he had to grow on all these virtues
[14:36] right right hey he had a lot of this
[14:39] right here he wanted to kill him bullets
[14:41] took the gun out if it wasn't for the
[14:43] grace of God he'd have been a murderer
[14:46] try to commit suicide a couple of times
[14:47] but that was in his early part of his of
[14:49] his of his walk with God right yeah he
[14:52] didn't do that 60 61 62 he was back in
[14:55] his early part in the 40s you know when
[14:57] he first was beginning to see God
[14:59] brought him through all these things
[15:01] and give him a gift and give him all the
[15:03] things
[15:04] and he had the power we all have the
[15:06] power we but we must have the character
[15:09] to go along with the power
[15:12] not trying to say that Luther was
[15:13] satanic but what motivated Luther to
[15:16] drink Kabir and smoke a pup a smoke a
[15:18] pipe was a tank so we always say well
[15:21] power without character satanic so that
[15:24] means that church over there is satanic
[15:25] no I don't mean this is Satan's right
[15:27] here this
[15:28] morning's right here he's not anointing
[15:31] people like China he's already got them
[15:33] he's wanting to anoint you to keep you
[15:35] where you can't grow he hates this spot
[15:38] right here because he hates the Lord
[15:39] Jesus right right
[15:41] and you know what
[15:43] Paul we know Jesus we know but who are
[15:46] you right that was power without
[15:48] character was the seven sons of skiva
[15:51] they had power they did not have the
[15:54] character to use it right therefore you
[15:56] see what happened it rolled right back
[15:58] on this do you you have to have Divine
[16:01] love to make the change of the body yes
[16:03] you can't make change by them nobody can
[16:06] but what about
[16:08] are there people who go by the grave
[16:10] better at only at Holy Spirit sure
[16:13] there's people in the grave of that
[16:14] right there
[16:16] brother
[16:17] oh yeah but I know this is the time
[16:23] even
[16:24] he said in the pub but he he learned was
[16:28] to eat damn not the Holy Ghost the word
[16:30] was eat down through there he didn't
[16:32] have the word he baptized Jesus Christ
[16:34] he'd done all that why was I hold it he
[16:36] didn't have the word that we have wasn't
[16:39] like I've always said the word's always
[16:40] been there you can't eat the word down
[16:42] you eat the effects of the one down
[16:44] because it's just like I said many times
[16:46] that you take in this room say this room
[16:49] is the word
[16:50] all right this room is the word now you
[16:52] take hold your hand like this and you
[16:54] all hold it up right there well all I
[16:55] see is brother Jewel
[16:57] but now that don't do away with the word
[16:58] it's still here yeah that's good okay
[17:01] but Martin Luther could only sing right
[17:04] there all this was still word this was
[17:07] the power of God right you can't you
[17:10] can't diminish the power of God all
[17:12] right right now you can grieve the Holy
[17:14] Spirit and all those things but you
[17:15] can't diminish the power of God the
[17:17] power of God's right here it's ever it's
[17:19] never changing so it's right here but we
[17:22] can say okay Martin Luther had this
[17:23] month without John Wesley he had this
[17:26] much I see two people now
[17:29] this one had this much now that doesn't
[17:30] do away with you over here right you're
[17:33] still the word of God
[17:34] but Martin Luther only had a cube of it
[17:37] he had one tube Wesley was a little bit
[17:39] bigger to you then you come into
[17:41] Pentecost had a little bit bigger to you
[17:42] because she ain't gonna brother round
[17:43] okay the fullness of the word
[17:47] 1963 I believe brother random was
[17:49] adopted just like the Lord Jesus went on
[17:51] the top of the mountain and said this is
[17:53] my beloved Son and do my police as well
[17:54] here you him that's my thought right
[17:57] because of the characteristic of what
[17:59] happened his own sunset Mountain those
[18:01] angels came down took him up into that
[18:04] constellation all right but it was not
[18:06] because he was just a prophet it was
[18:08] because of his revelation because
[18:10] Revelation is what positions you
[18:12] revelation of knowledge positions you in
[18:15] knowledge it's not just a knowledge of
[18:17] Revelation brings that knowledge all
[18:20] right Revelation shows you where you're
[18:22] at at any time with God it's what the
[18:24] prophet says you you should know where
[18:25] you're at
[18:26] because one thing for sure if you're a
[18:28] child of God we're gonna read it in just
[18:30] a minute
[18:31] no I'm going to save it for upstairs but
[18:33] we're going to see that God's going to
[18:35] try you and test you
[18:38] if you're a true child God's going to
[18:40] try you and test you
[18:41] right because you know it's not for his
[18:44] benefit right it's for yours what were
[18:46] you going to say no I'm just using it
[18:48] you know because we were talking about
[18:50] coming up through the baptism that
[18:51] really goes remember those jobs that
[18:53] died by death but really when you come
[18:56] to the full adoption they got to wait on
[18:58] us remember this that would not be made
[19:00] perfect right Paul said they ain't
[19:03] without us cannot be made perfect so see
[19:05] I'm sorry excuse me Paul stood right
[19:07] here and said I Illustrated many times
[19:10] in preaching Paul is standing right here
[19:12] and he says they the Old Testament they
[19:15] without us because remember the whole
[19:17] Hebrews 11 is about the Old Testament
[19:19] saint but they without us cannot be made
[19:22] perfect
[19:24] but he became a they when he died right
[19:27] and now we're over here looking all the
[19:31] way down to Adam
[19:33] that they without us yeah and as long as
[19:37] we're still alive we're in us if we die
[19:39] we're obey and then you're waiting on
[19:41] you know just like the saints that have
[19:44] gone on before they're waiting on us
[19:46] because they could not come to control
[19:49] us of adoption or to the fullness of the
[19:53] word they couldn't come to the fullness
[19:54] of the word and they had to see listen
[19:57] because death either death cleanses you
[20:00] here or death cleanses you in the grave
[20:02] one of the two everybody understand that
[20:04] the dying out to yourself cleanses the
[20:06] salt right right the old used Dead all
[20:08] right not divorce your husband got to be
[20:10] dead right okay so it's not that they
[20:12] kill your soul and give you a new one
[20:14] that's that's exchange of soul I don't
[20:16] believe that but I believe it kills the
[20:17] nature that's on that Soul yes the
[20:20] Nature's killed off and then God comes
[20:22] in Burns with the fire and Holy Ghost
[20:24] and then here you are like like get your
[20:27] home
[20:28] brother Graham said God comes down with
[20:30] a holy fire right Burns you out cleanses
[20:33] you and makes you a new creature our
[20:34] creation and that's what the world is
[20:36] going to be and the Millennium it's
[20:37] going to be a new creation
[20:39] but you have to be careful with that
[20:41] because if you're using your types like
[20:43] we talking about there's more you use
[20:44] your kayak though because remember in
[20:45] the Millennium they're still the devil's
[20:47] still there that's right
[20:49] Jesus is on the earth the bribes on the
[20:52] earth 144
[20:53] 000 on the earth Satan's still there yes
[20:56] that's like right now we receive the new
[20:58] birth but Satan's still here
[21:00] what we're looking for is when he burns
[21:02] it with that Holy Fire that kills the
[21:04] demons
[21:05] when we go into the future home see not
[21:08] the Millennium The millennium's Still In
[21:09] Time the Millennium now listen to us
[21:13] to us we're perfect we're made perfect
[21:15] here right right but the world's not
[21:18] made perfect until
[21:20] after the day of judgment the Judgment
[21:22] Day right because you got the Devil he's
[21:24] still there same way for you and I you
[21:25] get the new birth the devil's still
[21:26] there yeah he's still there I don't know
[21:29] if he don't come to your house he comes
[21:31] to mind okay
[21:33] so I get another portion of him every
[21:36] once in a while and I don't like that
[21:38] but we've come to a place where we've
[21:40] got to understand that there's even in
[21:43] the message and we'll do it upstairs
[21:44] break it down a little bit more than we
[21:45] did down here
[21:47] when you say when you say you're typing
[21:50] the justification about the Holy Ghost
[21:52] you get the Holy Ghost the fire god
[21:54] Burns that old nature off of that song
[21:57] and your new creation in God that soul
[22:00] is eternal yes he says Eternal as ever
[22:02] will be that's Eternal can't change that
[22:06] that's the same but what God's got to do
[22:08] then is he's got to work his way back
[22:09] out through memory reason conscious
[22:11] affection and Imagination
[22:13] and you really don't deal with sea taste
[22:15] spill smelling here because only she
[22:17] takes feel smelling here reacts to
[22:19] what's inside you right okay hit a man
[22:22] in the head
[22:24] you can't see no more you know
[22:26] can't hear anymore that's just bodily
[22:28] function but what we got to deal with
[22:30] and brojo this is where we all got to
[22:32] deal with memory reason conscious
[22:34] affection imagination that's right right
[22:36] because if you're born again in your
[22:37] soul it's only one either Faith or doubt
[22:40] not faith and doubt that's right it's
[22:42] either Faith or doubt right you only got
[22:44] one one sense but now that our round
[22:48] that next one has five
[22:49] and that's the Devil's Playground memory
[22:53] is that what bothers you my memories
[22:55] won't bothers me my reasoning against
[22:57] the word right my conscience of what
[23:00] I've done before that's not gonna ever
[23:01] let you forget about them imagination
[23:03] there's no imagination in God
[23:06] right that's right yeah there's no
[23:08] imagination in God and then a faction
[23:10] that's feel your love we have to change
[23:12] that to Agape Love that's right it has
[23:15] to be changed feel your love just gonna
[23:17] make you love your wife or love somebody
[23:18] else's wife yeah I mean honestly you
[23:21] know because it's a lust of the flash of
[23:23] the flag but what we got to do is we got
[23:25] to change that's why I said many times
[23:28] um with Adam
[23:30] with Adam and Eve
[23:32] when when she did what she did and
[23:35] that's what God revealed to me the other
[23:37] day and Matt you know maybe a little
[23:39] slow but you know a lot of these
[23:41] preachers preached that Adam had to
[23:42] place your seed need to save her when he
[23:44] didn't say sex ain't saved nobody no
[23:47] ever come on ever sex is never sex is
[23:50] the problem
[23:52] but anyway but Adam that was not see
[23:55] they're taking filial love right yeah
[23:58] they're taking filial love and swapping
[24:00] it for agape love no the reason that
[24:02] Adam didn't destroy Eve was because of
[24:04] the agape love
[24:06] right took over that feeling of love
[24:08] because remember
[24:09] if your wife would have come to you or
[24:11] tell them another day if your wife would
[24:12] have come to you and say look I've laid
[24:13] down with a beef
[24:15] right now would feel your love what
[24:17] would you do kill her I I you would you
[24:20] touch her
[24:22] really I mean would you would you touch
[24:24] her with filial love no you wouldn't if
[24:26] you're when your wife laid with a beast
[24:28] an animal right but agape love took over
[24:32] agape love took over in Adam because
[24:35] Adam was the son of God and he had the
[24:36] Holy Ghost right right right Agape took
[24:39] over Adam and went past that feel your
[24:42] love and said I can't destroy her
[24:44] because she's a part of me that's right
[24:45] type in Christ in the church but now his
[24:48] sex act didn't save him nobody Adam seed
[24:51] polluted everything yes
[24:55] Abel needed a sacrifice if able seed was
[24:59] so righteous what I believe is truly
[25:02] is that Adam knew he was the son of God
[25:04] hey he controlled everything God just
[25:06] said here you control the Earth I'll
[25:07] control heaven and I'm not gonna bother
[25:10] you I'm Gonna Leave You Alone you know
[25:11] Adam you take care of this world right
[25:13] but when that happened
[25:16] and I've always wondered why didn't God
[25:17] tell him before it happened
[25:20] he's the son of God God had to allow
[25:22] that to happen but he had to take Adam
[25:24] to a place
[25:26] to where Adam was the ruler of the world
[25:29] but now remember
[25:30] Adam was not a savior right there was no
[25:33] attribute of Savior in Adam right that's
[25:36] right he thought they was yeah
[25:39] Adam thought he could go out and get Eve
[25:41] and bring her back and restore her
[25:43] excuse me he just fell right in with her
[25:45] right he fell right in with her trying
[25:49] to go out and get her and bring her back
[25:50] because he remember he was the god of
[25:53] the Earth but he wasn't the god of Glory
[25:54] right there's only one person can say to
[25:56] you and that's the Eternal God man can't
[25:59] say to you from anything
[26:00] Adam included brother random included
[26:03] can't save you from nothing it takes God
[26:06] Almighty to save you and restore you so
[26:08] you know that's what I said about Adam
[26:10] we got to look past feel your love it's
[26:13] got to be the agape love of God that
[26:16] takes over everything because remember
[26:18] brotherly kindness brother Brown said
[26:20] brother does something to you
[26:22] you pray for him right brother you
[26:25] should do something to us we fight him
[26:26] shooting you know whatever but we pray
[26:29] for him okay are you gonna say something
[26:31] no no no no I'm sorry you but God had to
[26:33] set up a tight with Christ in the church
[26:35] sure absolutely had to set up a title
[26:37] but Adam got out there and found out he
[26:40] couldn't come back that's right so he
[26:42] got out there he thought he'd go out
[26:43] there and get him bring her back but
[26:45] then when he found out he couldn't
[26:46] restore her sure he had sex with her
[26:48] obviously because Abel came forth but he
[26:51] brought that to bring another line right
[26:53] to bring another seedling right all
[26:54] right but anyway so here we come up to
[26:57] here let me read this one I want to read
[26:59] that one quote here now what does it do
[27:01] then they're waiting for the headstone
[27:02] now that's what we're doing now we're
[27:03] waiting for the headstone we just love
[27:05] for God is love I didn't say we're
[27:06] waiting on it God's waiting on to put it
[27:08] in us when we when we say we're ready
[27:10] for it right we can't have it here and
[27:12] not be and because down here
[27:14] this is not baby
[27:16] this is science yes this is mature men
[27:20] this is this is babies this is how by
[27:22] father crying baby bear Daddy Daddy
[27:24] because you're a baby down here you're
[27:26] not crying daddy daddy up here no no
[27:28] you're not now what does it do they're
[27:30] waiting for the headstone which is love
[27:31] for God is love and he controls and he
[27:33] has the strength of every one of these
[27:34] things yes sir all right let's go to
[27:36] this one right here
[27:40] foreign
[27:43] unless we suffer with him we cannot
[27:45] reign with him you have to suffer to
[27:47] Reign so these are sufferings these
[27:49] ain't picnics
[27:50] you got to suffer through this okay this
[27:52] is life lesson
[27:53] you have to suffer to Reign the reason
[27:55] for this is that character simply is
[27:58] never made without suffering character
[28:01] is a victory not a gift
[28:03] a man without character can't Reign
[28:06] because power apart from character is
[28:09] the time because see the seven sons of
[28:12] skiba that they were they thought they
[28:14] had power but you see what happened but
[28:16] Power apart from character satanic now
[28:19] you didn't stop there though but Power
[28:20] with character
[28:22] respect to rule you're not a ruler down
[28:25] here remember if you read there in I
[28:27] believe it's Galatians a sun is a son
[28:30] you're born down here your son
[28:32] that's right right yes right right heir
[28:34] of all things
[28:35] but you're under tutors and governors
[28:37] until the time appointed
[28:40] in other words that you can handle them
[28:41] car keys like we were talking about
[28:43] right but Power with character is fit to
[28:45] rule and since he wants us to share even
[28:48] his throne on the same basis then he
[28:50] overcome and sat down in his father
[28:52] Throne then we have to overcome to sit
[28:55] with him and a little temporary
[28:57] suffering we go through now is not
[28:58] worthy to be compared to the tremendous
[29:00] Glory that will be revealed in US when
[29:04] he comes oh what Treasures are laid up
[29:06] for those who are willing to enter into
[29:07] the kingdom through much tribulation all
[29:10] right I gotta go hook bro the jewel up
[29:11] too so Lord blessing
[29:13] just uh read the stack the perfect man
[29:15] read black men in his name
