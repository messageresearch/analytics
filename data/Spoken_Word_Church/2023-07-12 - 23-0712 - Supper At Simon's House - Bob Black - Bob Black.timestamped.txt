[25:32] to see Chris to have Christian and his
[25:34] family here and we just saw them a
[25:36] couple weeks ago I think it was a couple
[25:38] weeks ago just uh just around the bend
[25:41] um it's so good to see everybody smiling
[25:44] faces
[25:45] um we're going to read uh tonight from
[25:48] Luke chapter 7 verse 36.
[25:52] and it'll just be a quick scripture read
[25:57] Lord God we're so grateful to be able to
[25:59] gather together around your word again
[26:01] Lord and we just ask Lord that you'll
[26:03] just bless the service tonight Lord as
[26:04] we go to here Lord we certainly Lord we
[26:07] haven't come to see any any particular
[26:09] person Lord but we've come to see you
[26:11] Lord and as we look into your word I
[26:13] pray Lord that you'll open up the eyes
[26:14] of our heart Lord Jesus so that we can
[26:16] see you more plainly
[26:17] give us give us Faith increase our faith
[26:20] Lord build us up Lord God so that we can
[26:22] we can have have more power in this age
[26:25] Lord Jesus
[26:26] will we ask their blessing upon the word
[26:28] and blessing upon your people Lord the
[26:30] night that you'll just bless the service
[26:32] and bless us Gathering Together We ask
[26:33] in your name amen
[26:36] I want to take a topic tonight just talk
[26:39] about supper at Simon's house
[26:41] and read Luke chapter 7 verse 36 if they
[26:44] can go ahead and bring that up and it
[26:45] says
[26:46] and one of the Pharisees
[26:48] desired him that he would eat with him
[26:50] and he went into the Pharisees house and
[26:53] sat down to meet
[26:55] and you maybe see that the Lord is
[26:57] Blessing to the reading of the word of
[26:59] course now that I think this is a story
[27:01] that we're all pretty familiar with and
[27:02] probably for me with how brother Branham
[27:04] told it but um tonight just want to kind
[27:07] of rehash some of these things and and
[27:09] talk about the difference between this
[27:12] um you know brother Brown I'm really
[27:13] exposed the difference between Simon the
[27:15] one the Pharisee that invited Jesus over
[27:18] to his house and then that little woman
[27:19] that kneeled down at his feet and washed
[27:22] his feet with her hair and poured out uh
[27:25] opened up that Alabaster Box and pulled
[27:27] that oil out and poured all over his
[27:28] feet
[27:29] now that's a striking difference between
[27:31] those two people there and you think
[27:33] about how that this Pharisee invited uh
[27:36] Jesus to Simon Jesus was invited to
[27:39] Simon's house Simon the Pharisee and
[27:40] what a strange thing that would be for a
[27:43] Pharisee to invite Jesus over to his
[27:45] house and that's what brother Branham
[27:47] would explain when he was preaching to
[27:48] us he said there's something wrong here
[27:50] a Pharisee wanting to see Jesus and
[27:52] having to eat with him for Fellowship
[27:54] the Pharisees hated Jesus they had no
[27:57] use for him at all he was a bl's above
[27:59] to them a devil a deceiver and no
[28:01] Pharisee had anything to do with Jesus
[28:04] he said the Pharisees set themselves
[28:06] against him because it didn't cope with
[28:08] their theologies and you know you really
[28:10] think about the position that the
[28:12] Pharisees had got you know they were
[28:14] trying they were trying to do what was
[28:15] right but they had gotten so wound up in
[28:17] their uh they're trying to adhere to
[28:21] their set of standards and things and in
[28:23] the commentary of their rabbis that they
[28:25] had made that they got away from the
[28:27] what Jesus would would Frame Up that the
[28:30] bear the essentials of just people do
[28:33] you love one another are you being good
[28:35] to one another do you love God and they
[28:36] had gotten away so caught up and and
[28:38] tithing mint and cumin and all those
[28:41] different things that they had just
[28:42] forgot the the real essence of what the
[28:44] the uh uh a good walk with faith in God
[28:49] should be and and Jesus would often
[28:53] refer to a Pharisee as a as a faker an
[28:56] actor what a horrible thing to be a
[28:58] faker somebody's just putting on uh you
[29:01] know you go through all the scriptures
[29:02] and you can see the things that brother
[29:03] Branham talked about and the things that
[29:05] Jesus talked about that a faker is just
[29:07] about the worst thing that you can be
[29:10] that just uh you know so many times
[29:13] brother random would say how that we
[29:15] want to see real genuine something real
[29:17] Gene that's what the world is looking
[29:19] for that that's what God is looking for
[29:21] that's what we're looking for when we
[29:23] come to church we want to see something
[29:24] that's real genuine not a not a faker
[29:28] now now uh if you look online you'd see
[29:31] the definition of a hypocrite a
[29:33] hypocrite as anyone who makes out like
[29:34] they have higher standards or beliefs
[29:36] than they really do
[29:38] that a Pharisee would be a real a real
[29:40] good hip example of a hypocrite somebody
[29:42] that says that they uh they make they've
[29:44] got all these rules and things that
[29:46] you've got to adhere to all these
[29:47] weights that they can pile on your head
[29:49] and things that you've got to do but yet
[29:51] when it comes down to it they won't they
[29:53] won't even live up to it themselves
[29:55] think about the state of mind you would
[29:57] have to be at to look at somebody
[29:58] healing somebody on the Sabbath and say
[30:00] well there's something wrong with that
[30:02] uh you have to be twisted in your mind
[30:05] and you know that's what the devil does
[30:07] is the devil will anoint somebody and
[30:09] until their eyes have been just covered
[30:11] over us well they can't really see the
[30:13] real truth of the thing
[30:15] and I thank God that in this last day
[30:16] you know brother Brown always told that
[30:18] story of how that that his mama would
[30:20] come and rub the grease on his eyes
[30:21] to open him up so that he could really
[30:23] see I think in his last day I thank God
[30:25] that that we've heard a message to open
[30:27] up our eyes so that to tear tear the
[30:30] veil of what the devil has put over our
[30:32] eyes so that we can really see things as
[30:34] they really are and and not just not
[30:36] just see the word but to really see
[30:38] ourselves as we really are I think it
[30:41] behooves us to constantly be examining
[30:43] ourselves examining our motives
[30:45] examining our objectives to see to see
[30:48] if our lives are matching up with what
[30:50] the word says because I I I don't want
[30:53] anything to be fake about me and I know
[30:55] that you can have the same confession
[30:57] tonight that we don't we don't want to
[30:58] be fake we don't want to be actors and
[31:00] we don't want anything even remotely
[31:02] similar to what uh these stories that we
[31:05] read about the Pharisees and all Balaam
[31:08] Judas everybody in the Bible we don't
[31:10] want to have any any characteristics
[31:12] similar to those at all
[31:14] so another example of a hypocrite they
[31:16] might tell you to do something one way
[31:18] and then ignore their own advice and do
[31:20] the opposite now Jesus when he was
[31:22] talking about hypocrites he would always
[31:23] say things like like he would use
[31:26] examples about how being real clean on
[31:29] the outside but on the inside being real
[31:30] filthy and he'd say woe unto you scribes
[31:33] and Pharisees Hypocrites for you make
[31:35] the clean of the outside of the cup of
[31:37] the platter you might clean the outside
[31:39] of the cup of the platter but when
[31:40] they're full of extortion and excess
[31:42] Thou blind Pharisee cleanse first that
[31:45] which is within the cup and platter that
[31:46] the outside of them may be clean also
[31:48] and another example he'd use was the
[31:50] widest sepicles white beautiful on the
[31:53] outside but full of dead men's Bones on
[31:55] the inside full of dead men now now
[31:58] let's just pause a second and really
[32:00] think about that now to to think now
[32:03] God there's these two extremes where you
[32:05] can be a real genuine Christian or you
[32:07] can be a real genuine unbeliever but
[32:10] right there in the middle is is just a
[32:12] mess of fields somebody that on the
[32:14] outside they look like a real genuine
[32:16] look pretty good but on the inside
[32:18] they're they're they got dead men's
[32:20] bones they're just it's just a terrible
[32:23] on the inside and that's the danger
[32:25] ground that God does not want us to be
[32:28] in in Revelation chapter 3 he said I
[32:30] Know Thy Works speaking of the layout of
[32:32] sea and age Thou Art neither cold nor
[32:34] hot you haven't gone to either one or
[32:36] one side or the other you know you
[32:38] hadn't gotten real hot for God and you
[32:40] hadn't gotten real cold you're just
[32:42] right there in the middle he said I
[32:44] would thou were cold or hot now what's
[32:47] up what can we take away from this
[32:49] tonight is that the religious fence
[32:51] where you're on the fence and you hadn't
[32:53] committed yourself one way or the other
[32:55] that that is the worst place that you
[32:58] can be oh tonight if you ain't picked a
[33:00] side if you hadn't declared which side
[33:02] you're going to be on maybe tonight can
[33:04] be the side where you say I'm going to
[33:06] sell out for God I'm gonna what what
[33:08] what are we talking about tonight we're
[33:10] talking about Pride I'm ready to lay it
[33:12] down all of my pride and lay down all of
[33:14] my self-wheel and all of my everything
[33:16] that I am and give it all to Jesus oh if
[33:20] you can come like that and do like that
[33:22] little woman that just humbled herself
[33:23] at Jesus feet and just poured out
[33:25] everything and broke the bottle that's
[33:27] that's the way that God wants us to come
[33:29] to him no but if you're on the fence
[33:31] that's the worst place that you you can
[33:33] be the fence is it that's that's that's
[33:37] the most terrible horrible place that
[33:40] you can be to be an actor to be a faker
[33:42] to come amongst the Assembly of God and
[33:44] say well I I I'm acting like a Christian
[33:47] I may be taking communion doing the
[33:49] things that everybody else is doing
[33:50] paying tithes but on the inside your
[33:53] dead men's bones there's something
[33:55] corrupt there's something cankered on
[33:56] the inside and on the inside your
[33:58] character hadn't been changed you still
[34:00] want to do the things of the world you
[34:02] don't really love God the way that you
[34:03] want to you ought to the way that he he
[34:06] he's telling you you you should but
[34:08] there's something that still Longs for
[34:10] the things of the world oh there's a
[34:12] there's a gospel there's a there's a
[34:14] word that can take all of that out I
[34:16] thank God tonight that that God give us
[34:18] a gospel that can change our nature and
[34:21] change our character so that we can be
[34:23] like him so that we can walk like him
[34:26] and talk like him and so that we don't
[34:28] have to live like the world I I thank
[34:30] God that that's what this message does
[34:32] to a real genuine believer is change
[34:35] them so that they ate like they used to
[34:37] be and brother Brandon would say he'd
[34:39] say you can tell now think about this
[34:41] Pharisee why was it so strange that this
[34:43] Pharisee wanted Jesus to come into his
[34:45] house it was strange because you can
[34:48] tell where you could tell where you are
[34:50] you can tell where you are spiritually
[34:52] by what you're attracted to you can tell
[34:54] where you are spiritually by who you
[34:56] hang around what kind of friends you
[34:58] associate what kind of music you listen
[35:00] to and what kind of literature you read
[35:02] and what's hanging on your wall and
[35:03] what's on your computer you can tell
[35:05] because like attracts to like and that's
[35:08] why it's very odd for this Pharisee to
[35:11] want Jesus in his home because at
[35:13] Pharisee was not like Jesus it's very
[35:16] odd that this Pharisee wanted Jesus in
[35:18] his home
[35:19] now brother Ryan would say a seven or
[35:21] eight-year-old girl likes to print play
[35:23] around with little children her age why
[35:25] because like attracts like a a little a
[35:28] little child is going to want to play
[35:29] around with other little children not
[35:31] not with Granny or something not granny
[35:33] might be able to show him how to how to
[35:35] uh quilt or something like that but most
[35:37] of the time a seven or eight year little
[35:39] girl she don't want to have nothing to
[35:41] do because that's human nature and there
[35:44] ain't nothing wrong with that that's
[35:45] just how things how how we're made we
[35:48] want to be around people that are like
[35:50] us and what's the point he's getting at
[35:53] it a Christian is going to want to be
[35:55] around a Christian and an unbeliever is
[35:57] going to want be around want to be
[35:59] around an unbeliever he said if she
[36:01] follows Grandma all the time now it's
[36:03] either that Grandma's real good to her
[36:05] or she's grandma's little pet young
[36:07] people like to go with young people
[36:09] young people like to hang out with young
[36:11] people little children playing in the
[36:13] streets they have things in common
[36:14] they're dolls and their tops and their
[36:16] hobby horses and things little children
[36:18] associate with little children children
[36:20] young girls associate with young girls
[36:22] the middle-aged women with the middle
[36:23] age the old with the old heart you never
[36:26] see crows and doves hanging out together
[36:28] oh to think about that that you can if
[36:31] we can examine ourselves and see what
[36:33] kind of people do I like to hang out
[36:35] with do I like to hang out with weed
[36:37] smokers and pot smokers and people that
[36:38] are passing around dirty pictures and
[36:40] stuff no because that ain't my that
[36:42] doesn't match up with my character and
[36:44] the same thing if you really examine
[36:46] yourself and find out what you like what
[36:48] you hang around with the kind of friends
[36:50] that you have the kind of people that
[36:51] you associate with the kind of people
[36:53] that you talk to on Instagram or
[36:55] Facebook the kind of friend groups that
[36:57] you have it will show it will put on
[36:59] display the kind of person you are or if
[37:02] you like to sit around and you talk
[37:03] about talk about the word and you want
[37:05] to you want to hear somebody tell you
[37:07] about the gospel and how God changed
[37:09] them and testify that shows the kind of
[37:11] person you are why because it's putting
[37:13] your character on display your character
[37:15] yeah that's the only thing that you're
[37:17] going to leave this world with is your
[37:18] character so I want to make sure that my
[37:20] care character's right I want to let go
[37:22] of all the pride and all the stuff that
[37:24] you can accumulate in this world all the
[37:27] things that can get built up and let go
[37:28] of everything anything that'll hinders
[37:30] me lay aside all the wastes so easily
[37:33] beset you and build up something that's
[37:35] Everlasting something oh God I want you
[37:38] to build up joy and peace and something
[37:40] to stay with you forever and ever and
[37:43] you can know what you've been building
[37:44] up because you can look at what you're
[37:46] attracted to
[37:47] her crow and a dove is two different
[37:50] kinds of bird birds that one has one
[37:52] thing and the other has the other
[37:53] brother Brandon would say a crow doesn't
[37:56] like what a dove likes a crow does not
[37:59] like what a dove likes or a crow can try
[38:03] to be like a dove all at once but it
[38:05] just can't it just can't eat the same
[38:06] stuff same stuff that it does can a crow
[38:10] can't a crow can't love like a dove can
[38:13] a Coke can't forgive like a dove can a
[38:16] crow can't believe like a dove can a
[38:18] crow just can't do it cause it ain't in
[38:20] him it ain't in him to believe and they
[38:22] need him to serve God and they did him
[38:24] to love God with all the sitting because
[38:26] his character hasn't been changed but
[38:29] you take a real genuine dullness
[38:31] forsaking all the world forsaking
[38:33] everything that it is I want to put on a
[38:36] real Dove character that's on display
[38:39] said a hypocrite an imposter he can go
[38:42] to the world and affiliate with the
[38:44] world and act like the world and live in
[38:45] the world and enjoy the pleasures of the
[38:48] world and come to church and pretend to
[38:49] be a Christian but the real Christian
[38:51] can't go out into the world and come
[38:53] back there's something wrong there's
[38:56] something wrong
[38:58] you you want to be what is it tonight
[39:00] Church you want to be around people like
[39:02] you you want to be around people that
[39:05] love God you want to be around people
[39:07] that'll talk about the word you want to
[39:09] be around Christians because you are a
[39:11] Christian if you are a Christian tonight
[39:14] and if you're not a Christian tonight
[39:16] there's a simple remedy for that he said
[39:18] come unto me all ye that labor and are
[39:20] heavy laden he said he all you got to do
[39:22] is look to him like they look to the
[39:24] Brass serpent in the wilderness oh you
[39:26] got to look to him it's a simple remedy
[39:29] if we just humble ourselves and lay
[39:31] aside our pride
[39:33] show me your company I'll tell you who
[39:36] you are show me your diet I'll tell you
[39:39] your nature
[39:40] it's hard for a Christian to stay in
[39:42] rock music
[39:43] now you you and I know we all know that
[39:46] when you go to to Walmart or or whatever
[39:49] story you'd like to go to or you're
[39:51] sitting down for maybe some burritos at
[39:53] the at the Mexican restaurant and they
[39:55] start playing that rock music something
[39:56] just twinges it it there's something
[39:59] something off kilter because a Christian
[40:01] don't like something like that a
[40:04] Christian wouldn't be able to stay in
[40:05] the club with their music in their dress
[40:07] a Christian wouldn't be able to stand a
[40:09] bad environment there's things that a
[40:11] Christian don't an unbeliever don't
[40:12] won't mind it an unbeliever likes that
[40:15] and they're drawn to it but a Christian
[40:17] that's not if you you can't draw that
[40:20] through a thinking man's filter so it's
[40:22] been filtered out by the Holy Ghost and
[40:24] your your desires and everything has
[40:26] been changed showed me your diet and
[40:28] I'll tell you your nature and second
[40:30] Corinthians Paul said be not unequally
[40:32] yoked together with unbelievers for what
[40:34] Fellowship path of righteousness with
[40:36] unbelievers and with unrighteousness and
[40:38] what communion hath light with darkness
[40:40] in James chapter 4 he said he adult and
[40:43] adulteresses know ye not that the
[40:45] Friendship of the world is enmity with
[40:48] God to even be friends with the world to
[40:50] like the things that are in the world in
[40:52] First Corinthians chapter 15 he said be
[40:54] not deceived the evil Communications
[40:56] corrupt good manners it matters who your
[41:00] friends are matters what you listen to
[41:01] how you talk it matters in Ephesians
[41:04] chapter 5 it says have no fellowship
[41:05] with the unfruitful works of darkness
[41:07] but rather reprove them
[41:10] it matters who you hang around with it
[41:12] matters who your friends are it matters
[41:14] what you're attracted to
[41:16] right brother Adam said let me go into
[41:17] your house and see what you read let me
[41:19] listen to the to the kind of music you
[41:21] have playing
[41:23] let me see what kind of literature you
[41:26] read let me look in your office and see
[41:27] if it's a big bunch of these vulgar
[41:29] pictures of Pinups and things and you
[41:31] tell me you're Christian I won't say
[41:33] nothing to you but in my heart I will
[41:35] watch what kind of fruit you're bearing
[41:37] see because that's your diet
[41:40] your fruit your life tells you what you
[41:45] are amen there's just something in a
[41:46] dove that wants to be around other doves
[41:48] there's something in a crow that wants
[41:50] to be around other crows why is that
[41:53] because it's it's nature nature your
[41:56] character wants to be around other
[41:58] things that are like you but many times
[42:01] people try to do they try to fake their
[42:03] character like that Pharisee a Pharisee
[42:05] is an actor an actor is going to act you
[42:07] know what brother Brown would use that
[42:09] example of people people they go to the
[42:11] movie theater and they see somebody on
[42:13] the on the movie that they they want to
[42:14] emulate and then they start trying to
[42:16] act like that well that's the same way a
[42:18] lot of people try to do with
[42:19] Christianity they go to church and they
[42:21] they like the way a lot of people do and
[42:22] they like the way they dress so they
[42:24] want to act but without getting a
[42:26] character change on the inside oh you
[42:28] you see if you just act it out but
[42:30] there's something wrong on the inside
[42:31] dead men's Bones on the inside a pot
[42:34] that admin washed but it's clean on the
[42:36] outside but it's not clean on the inside
[42:38] then oh it just messes everything up
[42:40] because you're not genuine you're acting
[42:42] and he would use that example of you
[42:45] know somebody trying to trying to act
[42:46] like they're a good singer and they
[42:48] train their voice up real good until
[42:49] they can warble real good but he said
[42:51] he said when they're all done
[42:53] everybody's Minds on the note that they
[42:55] were singing instead of all worshiping
[42:57] God I I I think we could all agree
[43:00] tonight that I I love a song that's sung
[43:02] from a real Christian heart that's
[43:04] resonating from a real Christian
[43:06] experience somebody that's a real
[43:08] Christian believe like a little special
[43:10] we heard tonight somebody that's singing
[43:12] from an experience not from some put on
[43:14] something but they're singing from a
[43:16] place that they were at and where God
[43:18] brought them from and they're singing
[43:20] from something that's resonating for a
[43:22] whale or bubbling up from the inside not
[43:24] from something that they're trying to
[43:25] act out like a a blackbird trying to put
[43:28] peacock feathers in
[43:30] you know brother bear said birds of a
[43:31] feather flock together and you know some
[43:34] of the most beautiful outside Birds
[43:36] there he is are scavengers it's the
[43:39] inside that counts oh to think about
[43:41] that that some of the most beautiful
[43:42] birds that you could look at in the wild
[43:45] are are scavengers are are birds that
[43:48] can just eat anything they're pretty on
[43:50] the outside but what are they on the
[43:51] inside and he would say house Angels
[43:54] Road Devils putting on also think about
[43:57] what a statement house Angels Road
[43:59] Devils putting on he said oh my deliver
[44:02] me from being an actor be what you are
[44:05] God will bless you oh see why it's so
[44:09] important for preachers to just be
[44:11] genuine be there who they are not try to
[44:13] emulate anybody for singers to just sing
[44:15] sing what the way that God wanted them
[44:17] to sing and not try to emulate anybody
[44:19] else everybody just do the way
[44:22] everybody's been they were born with a
[44:24] with a with a gift the way that God
[44:26] wanted them to be made up and if we'll
[44:29] just be genuinely that everything can
[44:31] work in a way that will prosper the
[44:32] church
[44:34] you'll never be able to fake a Christian
[44:36] Life you'll you you gotta you gotta have
[44:38] a nature change to live this life
[44:41] to think about that you look at some
[44:43] people sometimes and you could just tell
[44:46] that they're just trying to fake up
[44:47] something but you'll never be able to
[44:49] fake it you can't fake it you gotta have
[44:51] a nature change you can learn how to be
[44:54] a dove and stick Dove feathers in but
[44:56] only a real Dove can be a dove only a
[44:59] real Dove can be a dove
[45:01] and Jesus said in Matthew chapter 7 and
[45:03] many will say to me in that day Lord
[45:04] Lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[45:06] and in thy name have cast out devils and
[45:09] in thy name done many wonderful works
[45:11] and then will I profess unto them I
[45:13] never knew you depart from me ye that
[45:16] work iniquity fakers
[45:18] fakers that thought that they were
[45:20] genuine because some spiritual things
[45:22] happen in their life maybe they saw a
[45:24] dream or maybe they maybe they even had
[45:26] a vision or maybe they could kind of
[45:28] understand some things or keep up
[45:31] but yet down on the inside they didn't
[45:34] have a change
[45:36] and that's what we're preaching on
[45:37] tonight is pride pride is what keeps you
[45:40] from having a change pride is what will
[45:42] prevent you from progressing with the
[45:44] Lord Pride like that Pharisee there
[45:46] Pharisee where you're unwilling to just
[45:49] let go and let God have his way
[45:54] huh
[45:56] you think about brother Adam would say
[45:58] that Simon signed the Pharisees sent a
[46:00] little flunky to go find Jesus and Jesus
[46:02] was all tired and sweaty and going all
[46:04] over Palestine and this funky went
[46:07] elbowing through the crowd and
[46:08] staggering along and he finally got to
[46:10] and you know brother Brandon was telling
[46:12] this story and he's all through the
[46:14] story he would say I see I see and I now
[46:17] I wonder if he really could see this
[46:20] flunky bumping up into Andrew in the
[46:22] crowd and he said I see Andrew taking
[46:24] him up close to where Jesus was where
[46:26] the sick and all was around he said
[46:28] Master here is a young man from Southern
[46:30] Palestine who has come with a message
[46:32] he's come a long way and he says it's
[46:34] from his master and he wishes to speak
[46:36] to you and to think now we'd have said
[46:39] what would we have said we'd said Master
[46:40] don't go to that hypocrite to stay away
[46:42] from him but Jesus will accept any
[46:45] invitation he said Jesus will always go
[46:48] where he's invited oh to think about
[46:49] that tonight that you've got a promise
[46:51] that you'll if you'll just invite him
[46:54] into your heart and just open up the
[46:55] door of your heart he'll he'll always go
[46:58] where he's invited the Bible says in
[47:01] James chapter 4 draw not a God and He
[47:03] will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands
[47:06] ye Sinners and purify your hearts you
[47:08] double-minded and what is a
[47:09] double-minded man a man that can't not
[47:11] make up his mind between being cold or
[47:14] hot can't make up his mind what side of
[47:16] the fence he's going to sit on he's
[47:18] right there in the middle of the fence
[47:19] but we can't make up his mind which way
[47:21] he's gonna go oh but if you're
[47:23] double-minded cleanse your hands and
[47:25] draw not a god
[47:27] and brother Ram would say that Courier
[47:29] ran away after he had delivered his
[47:31] message and he missed his opportunity
[47:33] tonight I I if we could just kind of
[47:35] think about that why why did the Rich
[47:37] Young Ruler leave feeling sad why did
[47:40] the rich the Rich Young Ruler had his
[47:42] opportunity all Jesus disciples when
[47:44] Jesus began to preach Doctrine they
[47:46] turned their back on him but they had
[47:48] their opportunity so many people had
[47:50] their opportunity in the Bible
[47:52] Jesus never breaks a promise he always
[47:55] keeps his promise regardless of what it
[47:57] is so he was going to he was when he
[47:59] promised he was going to Simon's house
[48:01] he was going
[48:03] to be there because Romans chapter 2
[48:06] verse 11 says there is no respect of
[48:08] persons with God
[48:11] I I thank God that there's no respect of
[48:13] persons with God he doesn't care if
[48:15] you're rich or poor he doesn't care if
[48:17] if you've been in church for 40 years or
[48:19] two minutes if you come to God with
[48:22] faith believing amen
[48:24] he will come where he's invited
[48:28] they got everything ready for the feast
[48:30] all of them in there entertain and so
[48:32] forth and Pharisee was having such a
[48:34] great time entertaining a celebrity
[48:35] brother Brown said the first thing you
[48:37] know Jesus arrived went into the house
[48:39] and sat down and they didn't know he was
[48:42] there
[48:43] this Pharisee was a rich man he could
[48:46] really put a big dinner on that like
[48:48] like let the poor stand and gape on if
[48:50] they wanted to that's the group that
[48:52] would tear up the world to make one
[48:54] proselyte out of a gentile and make him
[48:56] a two-fold more child of Hell than he
[48:59] was when he began
[49:00] what was it and brother Ram would say
[49:03] Pride pomp there he is Jesus sitting
[49:07] there forsaken
[49:09] Pride Palm
[49:11] oh paint this picture in your mind Jesus
[49:13] sitting there in the corner and a
[49:15] Pharisee should have been part of the
[49:17] most religious group of the day should
[49:19] have known
[49:20] to just humble himself at God revealed
[49:24] in flesh but brother Adam said it was
[49:26] Pride pomp and he said pride is such a
[49:31] cursed thing so awful so evil is pride
[49:36] now let's take a step back and think
[49:38] about what pride is brother would say
[49:40] way back in the beginning
[49:41] when God made Man In His Image Genesis 1
[49:44] 26 27 he said God made angels
[49:49] and and those ain't some of the Angels
[49:51] fell and they became fall on the spirits
[49:54] who could come and anoint you to
[49:56] influence your life and some of those
[49:59] Spirits he would he would he would go
[50:00] through the seven that were cast off of
[50:02] Mary Magdalene Pride boast uh lust
[50:06] variants all the different things that
[50:08] he listed out all of those all of those
[50:10] things there were spirits to influence
[50:12] you and he would say that's what pride
[50:14] is to think that a a person could be
[50:17] influenced by an evil spirit to make
[50:19] them act a certain way to influence them
[50:22] to act a certain way pride pride search
[50:25] accursion things so awful so evil it is
[50:28] it he said what a horrible curse pride
[50:31] is pride is when you say oh you're too
[50:34] good I'm too good to think now Saul fell
[50:37] because of Pride Judas fell because of
[50:41] Pride he thought he knew a better way to
[50:43] do it than than Jesus when he looked and
[50:45] he saw this little woman falling down at
[50:46] Jesus feet the Bible says from that
[50:48] moment
[50:49] he started going in a different
[50:51] direction Judas failed by transgression
[50:54] by the love of money and the pride of
[50:56] life is what brother Bradley said and he
[50:58] said oh what a horrible little black
[51:00] Devils is all pinned up in that heart of
[51:03] Pride thinking you're better than
[51:06] somebody else oh to think about how
[51:08] horrible that is
[51:10] to think that you're better than
[51:12] somebody else now we just come through
[51:14] uh the sixth month of the year which the
[51:16] world has designated pride month to
[51:19] think about what a horrible thing in the
[51:20] six month that month of man that that
[51:23] that designate carved that outside to
[51:25] celebrate pride and here brother random
[51:28] is explaining what an evil thing pride
[51:30] is to elevate yourself up to where you
[51:32] look down on somebody else and think
[51:33] that you're even greater than the word
[51:36] of God what is pride pride is the reason
[51:39] that is so hard to face our mistakes
[51:41] when we've got a problem and that the
[51:44] preaching of the word Goes Forth and
[51:45] gets begins to hit that the pride will
[51:47] rise up within us and say if it's there
[51:50] Pride will say oh well you you you start
[51:54] making excuses and start making reasons
[51:57] why it doesn't apply to you pride is the
[52:00] reason that it's hard to own up to our
[52:02] own failings pride is why it's so hard
[52:05] to say I'm sorry a proud father won't be
[52:08] able to tell his family won't be able to
[52:09] tell his wife or his two children that
[52:11] he's sorry that thing that rises up when
[52:14] they
[52:15] when they mention when they mention
[52:16] people and and thanks or whatever pride
[52:20] is why somebody can't say I love you I
[52:22] forgive you oh
[52:25] man
[52:26] come on now you all don't draw up on me
[52:29] I'm preaching about life
[52:32] y'all don't scare me tonight
[52:37] Pride will raise up when somebody
[52:39] suggests a different way why don't we go
[52:41] this way and a pride will rise up pride
[52:43] pride what is pride pride is the reason
[52:45] we get offended well so many times we
[52:48] want to make excuses for being offended
[52:50] but the reason we get offended is
[52:52] because of Pride we think that we're
[52:55] above being preached on or above
[52:57] somebody trying to correct us or above
[52:59] even maybe somebody making fun of us the
[53:02] reason that we get offended when
[53:04] somebody makes fun of us is because of
[53:06] Pride it's Pride but the Bible says in
[53:09] Matthew chapter 11 blessed is he
[53:11] whosoever shall not be offended in me
[53:13] that was a forgotten beatitude you're
[53:15] blessed if you will not be offended at
[53:17] the gospel you're blessed if you can go
[53:20] into Walmart and not be offended when
[53:22] people laugh at you like they did when
[53:24] we were coming back from from Kentucky
[53:25] and people openly there was a group of
[53:28] people in the store you'd hardly believe
[53:30] this sitting here that openly left in
[53:32] the store and my little family because
[53:35] they wore dresses but we're not offended
[53:38] at that I thank God that I got a little
[53:40] family that's got enough backbone that
[53:42] can walk proudly through the store and
[53:45] not be offended because they're dressing
[53:47] like a Christian and living a holy life
[53:49] in Proverbs Chapter 13 it says only by
[53:52] Pride cometh contention if you want to
[53:55] have a good fight get proud and not
[53:57] listen to somebody else that's trying to
[53:59] help you out only by Pride cometh
[54:01] condension but with the well-advised is
[54:04] wisdom and Proverbs chapter 16 it said
[54:07] pride pride goeth Before Destruction and
[54:09] in holy spirit before a fall and pride
[54:12] pride is why people offend pride is why
[54:16] we're nastier than one another pride is
[54:18] why because we think we know A Better
[54:20] Way pride is why Balaam tried to sway
[54:23] the children of Israel because he
[54:25] thought he knew a better way than God
[54:27] himself
[54:28] pride is why people offend and in
[54:31] Matthew chapter 18 it says whosoever
[54:33] shall offend one of these little ones
[54:35] which believe in be it or better for him
[54:37] that a millstone were hanged about his
[54:39] neck and that he would drowned in the
[54:41] depth of the sea
[54:43] it would have been better for Balaam to
[54:45] never even try to offend the children of
[54:47] Israel than to lay a stumbling block in
[54:50] front of them that would cause those
[54:51] little sheep to stumble oh you think
[54:53] it's easy to offend a little sheep a
[54:56] little sheep is a sheep it's got the
[54:57] character of her sheep it's not going to
[54:59] strike back but
[55:02] brother Brian said in in Revelation
[55:04] chapter 10 I actually pulled this from
[55:05] the notes for that sermon that I didn't
[55:07] get to he said what that this scripture
[55:09] means is not do them any harm just even
[55:13] to bring a fence to them just upset them
[55:16] about something it'd be better that you
[55:18] had your own self drowned or had never
[55:20] been born on the Earth than even to
[55:23] bring an offense to one another word
[55:26] youth really think that one of these
[55:28] little children of God the least of them
[55:30] in the Kingdom of Heaven is the
[55:32] Tabernacle of God that God has dwelling
[55:34] them in in that little and that little
[55:36] person so you're better you're better
[55:38] off dead than to put a stumbling block
[55:40] in front of that person it'd be better
[55:41] off dead than to take a little a little
[55:43] a little child of God and say well it's
[55:46] so it's okay to to drink some wine and
[55:48] then you see that person get pulled over
[55:50] with a DUI or get thrown in prison
[55:52] overnight their life ruin is better
[55:55] better for you to die it'd be better off
[55:58] dead than to put a little stumbling
[55:59] block in front of a Believer like that
[56:01] you're better off dying a horrible death
[56:04] than to cause a little believer to
[56:05] stumble
[56:08] to trip and fall
[56:10] to call somebody to shirk their
[56:11] spiritual Duty
[56:13] to seduce somebody to immorality
[56:15] to speak evil
[56:17] to give a little a little a little sheep
[56:19] to give them some drugs get them caught
[56:21] up in something
[56:23] you're better off dead
[56:25] where brother I'm said when you find a
[56:26] believer that really believes with signs
[56:29] following and you see the humility of
[56:31] their life not an impersonator know that
[56:34] they are a Christian a real genuine
[56:37] article just keep still
[56:39] thing you ought to do is join right up
[56:41] with them start moving along cause
[56:43] you're moving right up the King's
[56:44] Highway oh that's what the world wants
[56:47] is to see a real genuine believer
[56:49] somebody that can humble themselves and
[56:51] not be lifted up with pride
[56:54] in Hebrews chapter 10 it says let us
[56:57] consider one another to provoke unto
[56:58] love and to good works to think this
[57:01] this afternoon that your life can be an
[57:03] influence and your words can be an
[57:05] example to provoke one another your
[57:07] actions can set a path humble people
[57:10] will restrain themselves from offending
[57:11] others humble people are eager to
[57:14] forgive humble people recognize their
[57:17] weakness humble people reject honor as
[57:20] unworthy servants oh if we could just
[57:23] humble ourselves so far down that you
[57:24] can receive a true rebuke from the least
[57:26] little Christian
[57:28] all right brother man Pride is inflated
[57:31] sense of self-worth what is pride I've
[57:33] got to write I'm better I'm sufficient
[57:36] I'm sufficient in my own my own doings
[57:39] like Balaam and Judas Pride what is
[57:41] pride how you feel about that thing that
[57:43] you don't want Jesus to touch now that's
[57:46] why we're getting real quiet this
[57:47] afternoon because we've all got things
[57:49] that we just we feel like are off limits
[57:51] maybe I'm hitting on something that
[57:53] tonight you feel like is off limits but
[57:55] it ain't off limits to God because God
[57:57] wants us to mold us into his image that
[58:00] Romans 8 29 says you were predestinated
[58:02] to be conformed to the image of God of
[58:04] the Son of God and so if you want to be
[58:06] conformed to the image of God there's
[58:07] always things that got to be shaved off
[58:09] and one of them things has got to be
[58:11] shaved off as our pride all to exactly
[58:14] if we could really examine ourselves and
[58:16] examine our motives and as we're doing
[58:18] things and going through life and and
[58:20] and and things things hit us and prank
[58:22] us the wrong way if we can realize what
[58:25] that is that that's something that we
[58:27] need to get rid of all that we can keep
[58:29] moving up toward that Capstone on Pride
[58:31] will make you self-centered Pride will
[58:34] make you you you're when your knees and
[58:36] your desires and your achievements have
[58:39] to have priority you're you want the
[58:41] focus to be on you Pride will make you
[58:43] boastful where you got to have constant
[58:45] validation and recognition
[58:47] oh when you gotta have got to get all
[58:51] them likes on Facebook or ministers have
[58:53] to have a bunch of people Pat them on
[58:54] the back after they preached a sermon
[58:56] what do we need validation for our
[58:58] confidence should come from the word of
[58:59] God we shouldn't need constant
[59:01] validation constant recognition Pride
[59:03] will make you not care about others well
[59:06] you can't see somebody else's Viewpoint
[59:07] they won't be willing to sit down across
[59:09] the table from them and talk to him
[59:10] Pride will make you resent others that
[59:13] threaten your position or threaten where
[59:15] you are Pride will bristle Up when
[59:18] somebody says something you don't like
[59:20] Pride says I more than find the way that
[59:23] I am the way that I am is good enough
[59:25] Judas and Balaam and Cain the way that I
[59:29] am is good enough it's going to be my
[59:32] way or the highway Pride will make you
[59:34] treat somebody differently based on how
[59:36] they treat you
[59:37] in Proverbs chapter 28 it says to have
[59:40] respective persons is not good for for a
[59:43] piece of bread that man will transgress
[59:47] to have respective persons
[59:50] you know what that means that means if
[59:52] somebody pass you on the back you treat
[59:53] him real good somebody doesn't tell you
[59:55] they like you then you treat them bad
[59:57] but oh that's that's something we got to
[59:59] get rid of
[1:00:01] everybody's got to be treated the same
[1:00:03] isn't that what Billy Paul said the
[1:00:05] greatest Miracle he ever saw was his dad
[1:00:07] you could not tell who his enemy was and
[1:00:09] who he loved or you know
[1:00:12] you couldn't tell
[1:00:14] that's the kind of life that I want to
[1:00:16] live is where you can't tell not to be a
[1:00:19] respecter of persons Pride will have you
[1:00:21] going out every way for to get some
[1:00:23] popularity in James chapter 2 it says if
[1:00:27] you fulfill the law according to the
[1:00:28] scripture Thou shalt love thy neighbor
[1:00:30] as thyself you do well but if ye have
[1:00:32] respected persons you commit sin and are
[1:00:35] convinced of the law as transgressors
[1:00:38] if you have respect to persons
[1:00:41] because of pride Pride will make you
[1:00:44] seek out popularity Pride will make you
[1:00:46] seek out the claps on the back
[1:00:48] Pride will keep you from raising your
[1:00:51] hand in church Pride will keep you from
[1:00:53] saying amen and pride will keep you from
[1:00:56] really worshiping the way that God wants
[1:00:58] you to worship oh you ever watch an
[1:01:00] evangelist come through and he'll get
[1:01:01] he'll get somebody to really break
[1:01:03] through what are they breaking through
[1:01:04] that Pride they're breaking through
[1:01:05] where they just don't care about what
[1:01:07] anybody else thinks and that's when
[1:01:09] something begins to happen it didn't
[1:01:12] something happen when that little woman
[1:01:13] got down at Jesus feet and brother Ryan
[1:01:15] said she got out of order she got out of
[1:01:18] order when she broke that oil all over
[1:01:20] Jesus feet and something happened what
[1:01:22] happened maybe she didn't some a great
[1:01:25] big light or something didn't appear but
[1:01:26] I tell you what she did get she got her
[1:01:29] sins forgiven oh you get out of order
[1:01:31] and get get rid of all that Pride a
[1:01:34] little bit something's going to happen
[1:01:35] you'll get your sins forgiven and you'll
[1:01:37] find out your character and your
[1:01:39] Nature's been changed and you're not
[1:01:40] acting like a crow anymore you're acting
[1:01:42] like a dove because God will do
[1:01:44] something for you when you lay down your
[1:01:46] pride lay down all that stuff that
[1:01:48] that's keeping you from from being a
[1:01:50] real Christian brother I'm gonna say
[1:01:52] Pride feels just like a little just a
[1:01:55] little complex you have oh you don't
[1:01:58] want Jesus to touch that because it
[1:02:01] would degrade your social standing in
[1:02:03] the community I'd rather degrade my
[1:02:05] social standing in the community than to
[1:02:07] rub my name off of the Lamb's Book of
[1:02:09] Life but they won't let him in that
[1:02:11] little pride holds him out oh you see
[1:02:14] how bad that pride is a devil it's an
[1:02:17] evil spirit and that's the thing that's
[1:02:19] keeping him keeping a lot of us from
[1:02:21] having a real blessing is pride it's the
[1:02:24] thing that keeps the spirit from
[1:02:25] breaking loose in the church it's Pride
[1:02:28] it's it keeps the thing that keeps us
[1:02:29] from really fellowship and with them one
[1:02:31] another is pride respected persons to
[1:02:34] one another our fellowship with this
[1:02:35] person because I like him but not with
[1:02:37] this one because he's he's got something
[1:02:39] that I don't really like brother said
[1:02:41] you want to look like the Joneses you
[1:02:43] want to act like your neighbor but God
[1:02:45] wants you to act like his child and get
[1:02:48] away from that pride and I don't care
[1:02:50] how much you draw up on me tonight I'm
[1:02:52] going to preach it I don't care how much
[1:02:54] you sleep tonight I'm gonna preach it
[1:02:56] because we've got to get away from that
[1:02:57] Pride if we wake up we'll see what God
[1:03:00] wants for us to receive in this hour he
[1:03:02] said Pride pump there he is Jesus said
[1:03:06] and forsaken why was he sitting there
[1:03:08] forsaken because of pride
[1:03:11] he said there said Jesus with dirty feet
[1:03:14] oh it does something to me when I say it
[1:03:17] Jesus unnoticed unnoticed Jesus with
[1:03:20] dirty feet made a gaze in stock after
[1:03:24] being invited
[1:03:26] he said they stroll the streets and
[1:03:28] young ladies go forth with flowers and
[1:03:30] they bouquet the sidewalks and hang down
[1:03:32] the flags with every sign of welcome but
[1:03:34] when Jesus comes to town he has to stay
[1:03:37] in a little Mission somewhere because
[1:03:38] crazy Holy Roller oh my
[1:03:43] Jesus them feet that will soon to be
[1:03:45] pierced for the sins of the world set
[1:03:47] with dust and dung uncomfortable
[1:03:51] I want to ask us ourselves tonight would
[1:03:54] you be willing to make him comfortable
[1:03:56] would you be willing to do something for
[1:03:58] Jesus now I'll tell you you know you go
[1:04:01] around to different churches and things
[1:04:02] and I think one of the one of the most
[1:04:04] uncomfortable things is to go to a
[1:04:06] church and nobody will come up and greet
[1:04:09] you and nobody will say something to you
[1:04:11] I I uh I'll just say recently
[1:04:15] this is probably a terrible testimony
[1:04:17] for a preacher to say but I actually
[1:04:19] avoided a church going to a church
[1:04:20] because I had been there in the past and
[1:04:22] it just was such an uncomfortable
[1:04:24] experience it was it was it's terrible
[1:04:26] when you go somewhere and out to think
[1:04:28] about Jesus sitting over there in that
[1:04:30] corner when the party was going on
[1:04:33] and everybody's laughing and joking and
[1:04:35] everything and nobody would go
[1:04:38] talk to him nobody would go humble
[1:04:41] themselves
[1:04:43] to think now would you be willing to
[1:04:45] wash Jesus feet or would you be afraid
[1:04:47] somebody will see
[1:04:49] now see what a what a strange thing it
[1:04:51] is that even in this day and hour that
[1:04:53] we're living in people are afraid
[1:04:54] ashamed to wash one another's feet in
[1:04:56] communion but Jesus said Peter saith
[1:04:59] unto him when they were washing feet
[1:05:01] Thou shalt never wash my feet and Jesus
[1:05:03] answered him if I watched thee not thou
[1:05:05] has no part with me why did Jesus wash
[1:05:07] feet because he was showing our example
[1:05:09] of humility show it to the god of the
[1:05:12] universe the god that had created ten
[1:05:15] thousand worlds and solar systems and
[1:05:17] universes was willing to get down at the
[1:05:19] feet of another disciper and washes his
[1:05:22] dirty feet that were caked with the mud
[1:05:24] and the filth of the of the of the of
[1:05:26] the road pride pride always wants the
[1:05:29] highest Place Pride always wants the
[1:05:32] best for themselves Pride always wants
[1:05:34] to lift up but humility humility will
[1:05:37] take what it can get now there's the
[1:05:39] real definition of what humility is
[1:05:40] humility is going to take if all you can
[1:05:43] get is crumbs that's that's what I'm
[1:05:45] going to get if you could be like that
[1:05:46] Greek woman and say I'm gonna take some
[1:05:49] like the seraphenician woman I'll take
[1:05:51] the crumbs if that's all I can get if
[1:05:53] you can be like Lazarus Lazarus the
[1:05:56] Bible says that he was he slept in the
[1:05:58] gate and the dogs come and licked his
[1:06:00] wounds and he was sitting there eating
[1:06:02] crumbs with the dogs if that's all you
[1:06:04] can get in humility that's what you're
[1:06:06] going to get humility humility is going
[1:06:09] to take what you can get from one
[1:06:10] another that's why the Bible says why
[1:06:12] not rather suffer yourselves to be
[1:06:14] defrauded sometimes things don't go your
[1:06:16] way sometimes things are different but
[1:06:19] in humidity you're just going to take
[1:06:21] what you can give
[1:06:23] brother Brown would say the flunk he
[1:06:25] meets you at the door and the
[1:06:26] Palestinian in the Eastern country and
[1:06:28] it goes goes to one of the wells and
[1:06:30] draws them a good Great Basin a good
[1:06:33] clear water and he removes your sandal
[1:06:35] or your shoes set your feet up across
[1:06:37] his knee and washes all this dirt and
[1:06:40] dust and dung and stuff off your body
[1:06:43] and then he takes another towel and
[1:06:45] wipes your feet and he washes them sets
[1:06:47] them down and then he takes your sandals
[1:06:49] and sets them up on a little mantel like
[1:06:51] sets them along like this at the door of
[1:06:52] entrance then he goes over and he finds
[1:06:55] a pair of fine satin silk slippers
[1:06:57] they're soft that's the compliments of
[1:06:59] the host he does that he has them
[1:07:01] sitting there he put them upon your feet
[1:07:03] until he finds one that fits you
[1:07:05] comfortably then he passes you into
[1:07:07] another place and then there's a man
[1:07:09] meets you there at the door and he's got
[1:07:10] a little Basin in his hand a little
[1:07:12] picture like and you take it and pour
[1:07:15] some of the oil in your hands and now
[1:07:17] that oil is made of very fine spigner
[1:07:20] and now speak nerd is made from this
[1:07:22] plant that they take it and they grind
[1:07:24] it up into powder and all you think
[1:07:26] about the type there that they grind it
[1:07:28] up into powder just like Christ was
[1:07:30] ground up for us and well as he died
[1:07:32] from the cross and he said there's a
[1:07:34] bush that grows in Arabia this this
[1:07:37] spicner this oil was so expensive
[1:07:39] brother Brown would said how did Brother
[1:07:41] Brown know how much that she spent for
[1:07:43] his she spent 180 Denari on that oil
[1:07:47] now normally in those times a 300 Denari
[1:07:50] a year was the average wage so that's a
[1:07:53] lot of money and that's why Judas got so
[1:07:56] been out of shape and pride looking at I
[1:07:58] think it it tells us in the Bible that
[1:08:00] he said why couldn't that oil be sold
[1:08:03] and given to the poor the money be given
[1:08:05] to the poor he's speaking out of Pride
[1:08:07] not understanding what was really
[1:08:08] happening here
[1:08:10] so many times we fail to understand
[1:08:12] what's happening because we look at this
[1:08:14] at the situation out of pride
[1:08:18] man now Jesus brother round was
[1:08:19] explaining the situation that this story
[1:08:21] he said the rich didn't want him the
[1:08:23] clean didn't want him the religious law
[1:08:25] Keepers didn't want him but while he was
[1:08:27] sitting there on the outside in the
[1:08:28] street there was a real bad woman in the
[1:08:30] town a prostitute
[1:08:34] then James chapter 4 verse 6 it says God
[1:08:37] resisteth the proud but giveth Grace
[1:08:39] unto them
[1:08:41] God doesn't want somebody proud all
[1:08:43] proud lifted up they're not going to be
[1:08:44] able to find their way to him in James
[1:08:47] chapter 4 it says humble yourselves in
[1:08:49] the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift
[1:08:50] you up
[1:08:51] that's how you want it that's how you go
[1:08:53] higher is get as low as you can
[1:08:55] now I I know sometimes it seems like
[1:08:57] we're just kind of harping on these
[1:08:59] things get as low as you can but that's
[1:09:01] because it works you get as low as you
[1:09:04] can and not try to lift yourself up and
[1:09:05] God will be the one to lift you up
[1:09:07] Proverbs 11 says when Pride come with
[1:09:09] income with shame but with the lowly as
[1:09:11] wisdom the lowly somebody that'll just
[1:09:14] be like a little sheep and allow
[1:09:15] themselves to be led that's why Jesus
[1:09:17] said my sheep hear my voice sheep not
[1:09:20] some wild animal not a Theron Beast that
[1:09:24] can't be tamed can't be trained but just
[1:09:26] a little sheep in Proverbs 21 and high
[1:09:29] look and a proud heart and the plowing
[1:09:31] of the wicked is sin now that's the kind
[1:09:33] of woman that came that that saw Jesus
[1:09:36] through the window or through the door
[1:09:38] of the lattice or saw him sitting there
[1:09:40] with somebody that uh despite her
[1:09:43] background she she was willing to Humble
[1:09:45] herself and get out of order and as
[1:09:48] brother Brian will explain do whatever
[1:09:49] it took to get to Jesus oh if we can
[1:09:52] just do if we can have that kind of
[1:09:54] perseverance that's why he preached that
[1:09:55] message perseverance if you if you're
[1:09:58] willing to do whatever it takes and not
[1:10:00] stop seeking not stop reading not stop
[1:10:02] coming to church not stop until you get
[1:10:05] an answer from God you'll find something
[1:10:07] will happen come on now now to think now
[1:10:10] this little woman was a prostitute she
[1:10:12] had a horrible background a terrible
[1:10:14] background and maybe around the room
[1:10:16] tonight we could say we've we've got
[1:10:18] similar backgrounds but brother Brown
[1:10:20] would say you say brother Brad I'm an
[1:10:21] I'm no prostitute he said I don't all
[1:10:24] together mean sexually prostitutions on
[1:10:26] a higher level you can Pro no think
[1:10:29] about this now you can prostitute your
[1:10:31] time
[1:10:33] you can prostitute your own selfish
[1:10:35] motives going around saying well I
[1:10:38] belong to this church I'm better the
[1:10:40] holy spirit will speak to your heart and
[1:10:42] you'll say I want nothing to do with
[1:10:44] that
[1:10:45] now if you can prostitute your time you
[1:10:48] can prostitute yourself to material
[1:10:50] possession and wealth consuming all of
[1:10:52] your focus you can prostitute yourself
[1:10:55] to celebrity culture you can prostitute
[1:10:57] yourself to the entertainment of the
[1:10:59] world you can prostitute yourself to
[1:11:01] power and success
[1:11:02] what good does it do if you got money in
[1:11:05] the bank and don't have God
[1:11:08] but you know if you're that kind of a
[1:11:10] prostitute where you've sold out you're
[1:11:11] who the gospel was for the gospel was
[1:11:14] for the broken and the miserable and the
[1:11:16] destitute
[1:11:19] I'm so glad that we can testify of how
[1:11:21] God delivered us
[1:11:24] I'm so glad that we can testify of what
[1:11:26] God can do to somebody with a miserable
[1:11:28] messed up life and I I want to say to
[1:11:31] you tonight that no matter what your
[1:11:32] past is Jesus can change your future
[1:11:35] just like he changed the woman at the
[1:11:38] whale's future just like he changed this
[1:11:40] little woman's future when she rose up
[1:11:42] there to think that all of her sins all
[1:11:44] the things that she had done when she
[1:11:46] rose up from there her sins were
[1:11:48] forgiven too
[1:11:49] right yeah
[1:11:51] let me skip he I hit I really don't want
[1:11:54] to keep everybody late tonight I know I
[1:11:56] know it's Wednesday night
[1:12:00] Psalm chapter 34 says the Lord is nigh
[1:12:03] unto them that are of a broken heart and
[1:12:04] saveth such as be of a contrite spirit
[1:12:07] Psalm 51 says oh Lord open up open thou
[1:12:10] my lips and my mouth shall show forth
[1:12:12] thy praise for thou desirest not
[1:12:15] sacrifice else would I give it thou
[1:12:17] Delight us not and burn offering the
[1:12:19] sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit a
[1:12:22] broken and a contrite heart oh God thou
[1:12:25] Wilt not despise not to think that that
[1:12:27] little woman coming through looking
[1:12:29] looking for Jesus noticing that he would
[1:12:31] have been forsaken nobody wasn't tend
[1:12:33] into him that that is what God wants is
[1:12:36] a broken Torah of heart somebody that's
[1:12:39] been through some stuff I think if we
[1:12:41] look back in our lives we can all
[1:12:43] remember when we were down in the valley
[1:12:44] down going
[1:12:46] in the midst of the Brick Kiln sitting
[1:12:48] on the ash sheet whatever you would say
[1:12:50] and that's where God allows us sometimes
[1:12:53] to get to those places because he wants
[1:12:55] us he wants us to get to a place where
[1:12:57] our hearts broken so that he can use us
[1:12:59] and he said the first thing you know she
[1:13:01] finds herself rubbing his feet rubbing
[1:13:03] his feet and the tears just pouring down
[1:13:06] he said sparkling water coming from her
[1:13:09] heart
[1:13:10] there set that alabaster box and the
[1:13:13] first thing you know in her hysterical
[1:13:14] condition her hair fell down the curls
[1:13:17] dropped down and before she knew it she
[1:13:19] had her hair a wiping his feet with a
[1:13:21] hair that was on her head
[1:13:24] he said what a mess
[1:13:26] what a mess
[1:13:28] I thank God for messy preaching amen
[1:13:31] amen thank God for messy praise
[1:13:33] I'm so glad tonight for a messy religion
[1:13:36] thank God for a mess yes when you were
[1:13:39] born of the water and the blood you you
[1:13:42] come through a mess thank God for messy
[1:13:45] births it's a mess thank God for messy
[1:13:49] prayer why is it a mess tonight as we'll
[1:13:51] be closing here in just a moment why is
[1:13:53] it a mess because all your Pride's gone
[1:13:55] your pride you laid that Pride down and
[1:13:58] you're willing to do like that little
[1:14:00] woman whatever it takes to get through
[1:14:02] and pushing through everybody going and
[1:14:04] standing at the judgey Pharisee selling
[1:14:07] her that all over the counter judging
[1:14:09] her as she leaves people said as she
[1:14:11] left that little store people were
[1:14:13] pointing at her and and wondering what
[1:14:15] she did in that store judge you judgey
[1:14:18] judgy but it's a mess it's a mess to get
[1:14:20] to Jesus it's a mess when something
[1:14:22] happens it's a mess where you can where
[1:14:25] you can let go of your pride and let go
[1:14:27] of your order and let go of your starch
[1:14:30] and just love God just love God then
[1:14:34] it's a mess he said she wasn't caring
[1:14:37] what them Pharisees was saying he said
[1:14:39] did Jesus draw back his feet and say you
[1:14:42] mustn't do that no sir he perfectly held
[1:14:46] Steel
[1:14:48] and all these things happened and then
[1:14:50] finally Jesus spoke and we'll end on
[1:14:51] this as the musicians come forward
[1:14:54] it says in verse 39 when the Pharisee
[1:14:56] which had bitten him saw it he spake
[1:14:58] within himself this man if he were a
[1:15:00] prophet would have known who and what
[1:15:01] manner of man woman this is that touched
[1:15:03] him for she is a sinner
[1:15:05] Jesus answered and said unto him Simon I
[1:15:08] got something to say unto you and he
[1:15:10] said Master say on
[1:15:12] there was a certain creditor which had
[1:15:13] two debtors the one owed 500 Pence and
[1:15:16] the other 50 and when they had nothing
[1:15:18] to pay he frankly forgave them both tell
[1:15:20] me therefore which of them will love him
[1:15:22] most
[1:15:22] Simon answered and said I suppose that
[1:15:25] he to whom he forgave most and he said
[1:15:27] unto him thou has rightly judged and he
[1:15:30] turned to the woman and said unto Simon
[1:15:32] see a style this woman I entered into
[1:15:34] thine house thou gave us me no water for
[1:15:36] my feet but she hath washed my feet with
[1:15:39] tears and wiped them with the hairs of
[1:15:41] her head thou gave us me no kiss but
[1:15:44] this woman since the time I came in hath
[1:15:46] not ceased to kiss my feet my head with
[1:15:48] oil I'll just not anoint but this woman
[1:15:50] hath anointed my feet with ointment
[1:15:52] wherefore I say unto thee her sins which
[1:15:55] are many are forgiven
[1:15:57] for she loved much but to whom little Is
[1:16:00] Forgiven the same loveth little and he
[1:16:03] said unto her thy sins are forgiven
[1:16:07] now you think about that that because
[1:16:09] she was willing to lay her Pride down
[1:16:11] her sins were forgiven
[1:16:14] I think as we stand to our feet I think
[1:16:16] it's such a striking thing to note at
[1:16:18] the end of that sermon when brother Ram
[1:16:20] preached the message Pride he pulled and
[1:16:22] he pulled and he preached his heart out
[1:16:24] and he had a little altar call and he
[1:16:26] asked anybody that was willing to lay
[1:16:28] their pride down to stand to their feet
[1:16:29] and he preached and he preached and he
[1:16:32] preached at the end of that sermon he
[1:16:33] said I look everywhere and I don't see
[1:16:36] one standing
[1:16:38] not one person at the end of that sermon
[1:16:41] was willing to lay down their pride
[1:16:45] Lord Jesus we thank you tonight Lord
[1:16:47] Jesus for your grace and for your word
[1:16:49] Lord has been delivered and I pray Lord
[1:16:51] maybe tonight Lord there's somebody that
[1:16:53] tonight on the way home maybe as they're
[1:16:55] staring up at the seed on little God
[1:16:57] maybe they'll realize that they need to
[1:16:59] lay some things down
[1:17:01] Lord if we can just come to the place
[1:17:03] Lord we're willing to just get so humble
[1:17:05] like that little woman Lord that Jesus
[1:17:07] said they'll be talking about her for
[1:17:09] the next 2 000 years and here we are
[1:17:11] still preaching about her little story a
[1:17:13] little woman that was willing to lay
[1:17:15] down their pride despite all the
[1:17:16] background despite all the all of her
[1:17:19] past Lord Jesus Lord we're just so
[1:17:22] grateful Lord for this kind of a
[1:17:23] testimony of what laying down your pride
[1:17:26] can accomplish Lord God maybe there's
[1:17:28] somebody here tonight Lord that you're
[1:17:30] pulling to Lord Jesus Lord as we cast in
[1:17:32] the net Lord God I pray Lord that you'll
[1:17:34] reach out and prick Lord whatever heart
[1:17:36] you need to preach Lord Jesus Lord you
[1:17:39] promised Lord that your word will not
[1:17:40] return void you promised that it would
[1:17:42] accomplish his purpose and Lord we're
[1:17:44] trusting tonight that it'll accomplish
[1:17:46] his purpose whether it's here in this
[1:17:48] little building or maybe out somewhere
[1:17:49] on the Airways somebody streaming in
[1:17:52] tonight and I I want to encourage Lord
[1:17:55] tonight Lord as we close in prayer Lord
[1:17:57] Jesus said if there's somebody that's
[1:17:59] Lord their heart is pricked Maybe be
[1:18:01] watching in tonight if they'll lead
[1:18:03] kneel down beside their bed in humility
[1:18:06] Lord I thank God that we've got a God
[1:18:08] that will answer back I thank God
[1:18:11] tonight Lord that you'll answer back
[1:18:12] lord Jesus when when we reach out to you
[1:18:15] Lord Jesus you just don't just stand
[1:18:17] there with your arms folded looking Lord
[1:18:19] but Lord you promised that you're a God
[1:18:22] that is still touched by the feelings of
[1:18:25] our infirmities
[1:18:26] thank you Lord Jesus
[1:18:28] amen let's sing something to him

[1:24:28] I think about a story that was told
[1:24:32] this guy was repelling off of a off of a
[1:24:35] rock and it's he got his rope tangled up
[1:24:39] and it was it got dark
[1:24:41] and he couldn't see so he got down to
[1:24:44] the end of his rope and it was dark and
[1:24:47] he said a voice kept saying or or The
[1:24:49] Story Goes The Voice kept saying just
[1:24:51] let go
[1:24:54] he hung on the boy said just let go
[1:24:58] well they found him the next morning
[1:25:00] froze to death
[1:25:02] and he was that far off the ground
[1:25:05] he didn't obey that voice
[1:25:08] he should have just let go and he'd hit
[1:25:11] the ground about two feet down below and
[1:25:13] he would have been rescued
[1:25:15] listen to their voice let go
[1:25:19] and let God have his way let's say that
[1:25:22] one more time
[1:25:22] [Music]
[1:25:29] his
[1:25:31] wonderful way you know it's hard to let
[1:25:35] go of things hard to let go of your kids
[1:25:41] you're fine
[1:25:46] [Music]
[1:25:58] his way
[1:26:01] that's hard to do it's hard to let go
[1:26:05] and let God have his way but you know
[1:26:07] what God's perfect
[1:26:09] so if you let go and give it to him
[1:26:12] it's going to be a perfect result but we
[1:26:15] just don't do that we try to keep it to
[1:26:16] ourselves that's wonderful let's give

[1:33:20] good pretty good chunk so we appreciate
[1:33:22] brother Dale always for letting us be
[1:33:25] able to do this and taking a little bit
[1:33:27] of the burden off of us financially amen
