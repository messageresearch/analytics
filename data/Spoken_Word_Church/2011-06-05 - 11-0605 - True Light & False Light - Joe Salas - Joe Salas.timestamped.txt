[0:01] so I'm going to kind of try to
[0:03] uh it's a true light and a false light
[0:07] so I'm trying of going to go a little
[0:08] bit on the false light so
[0:12] uh the first light that ever came into
[0:15] the world was uh God spoken light he
[0:17] said there let there be light and there
[0:20] was
[0:21] light in the first first john5 it said
[0:24] that God has life in John 8:12 Jesus
[0:28] said I am the life of the
[0:31] world no was the light for his
[0:34] day Moses was the light for his day
[0:38] Elijah was Al light for his
[0:40] day and in the end
[0:45] time the only light this world will'll
[0:47] ever see will be in the in the
[0:50] bride also in the end time the Holy
[0:53] Ghost will be the light which is is our
[0:57] guide and God always separates the
[1:00] light from the
[1:01] darkness uh let's go
[1:08] to Matthew
[1:11] 27 she got it over
[1:15] here 27 45 46 and then
[1:28] 50
[1:31] this is when Jesus was
[1:33] crucified he said now from the sixth
[1:36] hour there was Darkness over all the
[1:39] land unto the ninth hour and about the
[1:43] 9th hour Jesus Christ with L
[1:49] saying I can't pronounce the name that
[1:51] is to say my God my God why is
[1:54] forsaken me and 50
[1:58] says Jes Jesus when he cried
[2:02] again with a li voice till you yield up
[2:05] the
[2:10] ghost but he
[2:14] said I will not leave you without on
[2:17] Darkness I will send the light which you
[2:18] send the Holy Ghost in John
[2:23] 16
[2:28] 7
[2:33] so here's a man that can turn on the
[2:34] light when we have
[2:38] Darkness he says nevertheless I tell you
[2:41] that it is experien for you that I go
[2:45] away for I if I go not away the
[2:47] comforter will not come unto you but uh
[2:51] but if I Deport I will send him unto
[2:54] you uh
[2:56] 13 who when he said the spirit of Truth
[2:59] has come he will guide you into all
[3:02] truth or he shall not speak of himself
[3:05] but who whatsoever he shall hear that
[3:08] shall he speak and he will show you
[3:11] things to come which is the holy ghost
[3:13] at same
[3:18] time brother said and today it'll be
[3:22] light in the evening time and the
[3:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost in this
[3:26] revival is God's light in the last days
[3:33] let's go to Mark
[3:36] 5 2 to
[3:49] 12 I read this before but it kind of
[3:52] goes in with this what I'm talking about
[3:55] and he when he was come out of the ship
[3:56] immediately there met him out of the
[3:59] tombs a man with an unclean Spirit who
[4:02] had his dwelling among the tombs and no
[4:04] man could bind him no not with chains
[4:08] because they had been often bond with
[4:10] feathers and chains and the chains had
[4:12] been plugged by him and the feathers
[4:15] broken into pieces neither could any man
[4:18] tame him and all night and day he was in
[4:21] the mountains and in the tombs crying
[4:24] and cutting himself with stones but when
[4:27] he saw Jesus AAR he ran and wor ship him
[4:31] and he cried with a loud voice and said
[4:34] what have I to do with the Jesus the son
[4:36] of the most high Aur thee by God that do
[4:41] torment me not he said I know who you
[4:45] are you are the light of the world okay
[4:49] for he said unto him come out of the
[4:52] come out of the man the unclean spirit
[4:54] and he asked him what is thy name he
[4:56] answered and say my name is Legion for
[4:59] we we are
[5:00] many and he bestowed him that he would
[5:03] not send them away by the country there
[5:06] was not unto him the mounts of great her
[5:08] of
[5:09] swine and all the Devils received him
[5:12] saying send us into the swine that we
[5:15] may enter unto
[5:18] them so when he came he was a light so
[5:20] the darkness has to flee when the light
[5:23] is
[5:28] presence
[5:38] we've been busy this week so I might
[5:39] keep you guys here five
[5:52] minutes I'm still on there's a man here
[5:54] that can turn the light uh on the
[5:56] message uh brother said uh
[6:00] nothing natural nothing natural or
[6:03] spiritual can live without God's
[6:05] life life can only come then but light
[6:09] nothing natural spiritual can live
[6:12] without God's
[6:13] light think of that all right but when
[6:16] he sends us a light see and does all
[6:18] these things and then we reject it it
[6:23] now that's the pitiful part is when
[6:26] light is rejected when he sends it to us
[6:33] and I'll say this with all love and
[6:35] respect so there is something
[6:36] spiritually wrong with a man that run
[6:38] back into his denominations the Creeds
[6:41] and refuse to see the Bible light when
[6:44] it's shining right before him there's
[6:46] something wrong with him see he goes
[6:48] back into his cre and forms and shuts
[6:50] the doors and says there's no such thing
[6:54] as that the Miracles the days of
[6:56] Miracles has passed there's no thing as
[6:58] divine healing there none of these
[7:01] things that was for an apostle that man
[7:04] is spir spiritually crazy there's
[7:07] something wrong with him he has pulled
[7:09] down the curtains and rejected the holy
[7:11] spirit that came can come upon him if he
[7:25] can and that's the very reason today
[7:28] that that's match it that Jesus Christ
[7:30] still is the same it's turned down
[7:31] because the people are living in a glare
[7:34] of other ages the same reason they're
[7:37] turning down now we notice we have to
[7:41] say that a glare is the kind of a false
[7:43] light and glare is a false light same
[7:46] thing that
[7:48] glares like a mirage on the road you go
[7:50] down the road and if you driving cars
[7:53] and look down ahead of you when you see
[7:55] this the sun on the ground and it
[7:58] reflects the light
[8:00] like a mirage look like there's water
[8:02] all over the road but when you get there
[8:04] there's nothing there it's only a false
[8:07] Mirage the glare of a True
[8:12] Light usually in on the desert like when
[8:14] you drive in the PLS you know you go
[8:17] down this little there you can see that
[8:19] when you look you see like you look in
[8:21] and like you see water but you don't
[8:23] when you get there there nothing there
[8:24] you
[8:27] justat said that's what the was doing
[8:29] today showing people at
[8:31] Mirage a conso of churches a group of
[8:34] denominations which would turn out to be
[8:37] false because it's because there is real
[8:40] light shining that real light shining
[8:43] wasn't shining and Mirage couldn't be
[8:46] there real light said real light shines
[8:50] and that's they're living in a glare of
[8:52] another age another thing for it it's a
[8:57] hit and pass on now a glare this Mirage
[9:01] is false it's a glare of the Sun and
[9:04] that's the way they did the same thing a
[9:07] false glare of a True
[9:18] Light so is it today so has been in
[9:20] every age see the true word sign but
[9:23] they have been so traditionalized they
[9:26] they can't see that word they looking at
[9:29] glare and they're blind and glare will
[9:32] blind
[9:33] you
[9:35] there's are of off ofet it'll blind
[9:39] you Jesus said you're blind living a
[9:42] blind they they should be able to see it
[9:45] to see who had who he was but they
[9:48] didn't because they were living in that
[9:58] glare
[10:00] he said look what Darkness we we're in
[10:02] today look what's going on today look at
[10:05] murder rape Strife well has come to pass
[10:08] I believe what Billy Graham said in the
[10:10] last me meeting 10 years from now every
[10:14] citizen of California will have to pack
[10:17] a gun to protect themselves you can't
[10:20] put enough law enforcement and the
[10:22] people have just gone insane shooting
[10:24] murder rapes everything see it's going
[10:27] wild see upon the
[10:30] streets it's to day we're living in
[10:33] Sodom Sodom day you go to Atlanta you
[10:37] better be careful
[10:51] true he said a false light you know I
[10:53] was just thinking of something I was
[10:55] referring a lot about England but I was
[10:58] thinking about false light he said here
[11:01] not long ago you'll remember the
[11:02] greatest robbery that England ever had
[11:06] that was done it was a $7 million hold
[11:10] up I don't think there's ever been
[11:13] anything in the in the world to compare
[11:15] with it a great hold up recently of $7
[11:20] million even Scotland Yard can get get
[11:24] it figured out he said you know how they
[11:27] done it by a false light
[11:29] so they put a light on the railroad
[11:31] track caution caution light on till they
[11:35] come to a red light and they stopped the
[11:37] train and there the robbery took place
[11:40] just at at that right place a false
[11:43] light will give the greatest robbery
[11:46] that the Nations has ever known you'll
[11:48] Rob the nations of the greatest hold up
[11:52] greatest robbery it was ever done by a
[11:54] false
[11:56] light he said that the greatest robbery
[11:59] the Church of God has ever had is a
[12:02] false light they glare the their
[12:05] denomination is it's robbed them from
[12:08] the power of the Holy Ghost he took from
[12:11] the church the very Lifeline robbed them
[12:13] of the word when they accepted a Creed
[12:17] instead of the word it robbed
[12:27] them
[12:41] how how important is the Holy Ghost he's
[12:43] our light he's our God he's our teacher
