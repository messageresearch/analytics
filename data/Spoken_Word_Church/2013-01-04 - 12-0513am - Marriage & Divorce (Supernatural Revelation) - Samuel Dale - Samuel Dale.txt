the evening services that will make sure we announce it to where you can know and come and be you know be here on time for what we're going to do okay so if you like turning your scriptures I think that's all the announcements anymore there is a shower they've got an announce downstairs and you know Rachel she's she's sure sure to be clean because she's getting a lot of showers and things okay Matthew 19. and Romans 7. we appreciate all the things now we're not going to get this morning into the marriage and divorce I was going to you know the grace part to try to speak on it for at least one service or something but we will try to pick up that this afternoon because there's something here I want us to cover to be able to see it and understand okay so Matthew 19. and then we'll go to Romans 7. first three and the Pharisees came into him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife forever cause and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and he said for this call shall a man leave father and mother and she'll cleave to his wife and they claim shall be one flesh wherefore they are no more Twain but one flesh but therefore God hath joined together let not man put a Sunder they say unto him why did Moses then command to give a writing or divorcement and to put her away he said unto them Moses because of the hardness of your heart suffered you to put away your wife but from the beginning it was not so and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife accepted me for fornication and shall marry another committee's adultery and whosoever married her which is put away death commit adultery like Romans seven verse one know ye therefore brethren for I speak to them that know the law and that the law had dominion over man as long as he liveth or the woman which happened husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband he did she had lose from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she'd be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress no should be married to another man we're for my brother and you also are are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God for when we were in the flesh the Motions of the sin which were by the law did work in our members bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in the newness of the spirit and not in the oldness of the letter let's just you know let's read verse 7 because when we're tied together for him what shall we say then is the law of sin God forbid nay I had not known sin but by the law for I had not known lust except the law had said Thou shalt not covet amen you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now verse 7 we'll try to tie it in to uh what we're getting close to this afternoon if we don't have time we'll do we'll just do on that all right now we've covered at Lent and I'm sure it's not being lengthy enough to to help everybody to understand but to try to do the best we can to try to cover you know the uh situations of life and the things of marriage and divorce and you know seeing and talking about uh who can divorce and who cannot and we see that the woman cannot divorce her husband her husband must be dead you know but he can't divorce his wife for just anything it has to be a fornication and then we covered fornication and adultery has the same wording and then we uh stated I did for my own statement to you and to those who want to hear it that so you can say well I've got my wife away for fornication but if she commits adultery then I can't do it you know and marry again well I I don't believe it that way I'm just telling you I believe if your your wife commits adultery against you and there's no way of reconciling that back because brother Reynolds says you know that uh I believe if I run around on my wife she did she forgive me you know and he said I'd forgive her so I say if it cannot be reconciled then uh the husband could divorce his wife and because of her committing adultery which is the work same word fornication all right and then he could be free to marry again only in the Lord it goes close to Mary in the Lord to start with and if if a wife her husband dies she's supposed to marry in the Lord not just anybody so it's supposed to be you know in a different situation so I and we've made those statements and come down to the point of trying to see something and it it just came up and when it did I want to make sure you understand something because I'll make this statement probably about I've got it written I know at least four times but you see we think about the grace of marriage and divorce and we won't cover that we're just going to mention it and we we say well boy it was something you know but do we understand do we really understand the grace of marriage and divorce and uh you know what happens and what took place and uh but here's my whole point there's a lot of people in this message probably that really was happy and joyous to receive the point that they believed when they heard the message that everything was okay if they had received the grace of marriage and divorce all right but then don't believe the rest of the message or even some other parts of the message or something you know now I'm going to that's my point is to try to drive home or point to us if we don't believe all the message then there is no Grace of marriage and divorce that's right all right if we don't believe the message and I don't mean we say well now so and so he believes the message well do they believe the message that you know do they believe the word well they're all here there well then how can they believe in the grace all right amen that is given because you can't accept one without accepting the other there's no way amen it can be done that's what I want to try to Anchor into each and every one of us as we'll read it in a minute where the Prophet said a supernatural Revelation because of the opening of The Seven Seals that he could speak the grace of marriage and divorce now not not just because he could come out and do it you know he he knew the scriptures and he knew Paul had done he knew about Moses and all that but he couldn't come out and say it until God revealed it to him you know to to speak it too now that'll be the point of what we're driving at all right and if I repeat it five or six times through the message I deliberately wrote it circled it put a star by it and said make sure you say this again again again again again again okay so we'll we'll get into that part of it but go ahead brother um Anderson and pull up what we're looking at and this is more or less the heart that people cause the grace of marriage and divorce now well I said I'll keep repeating this but do we believe this you know the or here but we don't believe this you know when I'm illustrating like another part of the message say we believe in the grace of marriage and divorce but we don't believe in the true Revelation one God when I have can you put that together in there and understand it you know how can it be because you know that's that's the point I want to drive home this morning you know of what what we're doing and I always put this on to make sure that people would understand what we're saying that we found out what a marriage was was because you asked the girl to marry you and she accepted that constitutes a marriage as far as God is concerned does not give you a right we got into the little discussion there Wednesday about that part and maybe some can help with other wordings of it but you know the uh the the the point came up about what we were doing but you know I I've done the best I can do to try to show you that if you're married you don't go live together until you go finish the wedding up with the altar you know the the things the prophet said ought to be in the church but if you're just married to the justice peace you're still married but in order to be another state or so and then going on to the climax of man and wife together and the question was saying well you know if you if you're married why can't you go ahead and live together and the best conclusion I can bring is that is we don't want to be in unclean living and see the world is looking at you and I that's nothing else that's right all right if nothing else the world is watching our lives every step we make you know every move we make the world is watching it well then we go out and live dirty before the world and they think well they don't care but we ain't that dirty we wait until we go to the altar we wait until we have the ceremony before we live together well that's the way it ought to be because the prophet said the first kiss or to be when you lift the Veil well then you go out and live together you know with husband and wife I figure you probably kiss some so you'd be messing up see so they'd be a lot of things you know other than natural but we just just in plain language we don't want to live un clean we want it to be to where that you know that we uh want to be right okay let's get into the message now today if you want to listen to the takes on Wednesday night they're there for you all right so from marriage and divorce paragraph three um seven through 307 through 313 we're going to read the whole thing and then we'll come back we talk about friends and we go what was revealed to me to tell you right now so don't don't miss it now I'm speaking to our follower only who is following me and this message not the outside by me record of this before God just to this group only all right so now the grace of marriage and divorce is not for anyone outside of the followers of this message amen that's right well that's people out there saying well you all really thank y'all something no is the following of the message we will cover this in a minute only the grace of God to Moses in the day that he spoke it was for the followers of Moses only for the day of Paul was it for the followers of Paul now a lot of people claim it but that goes back to the statement I made a moment ago we claimed the message we claim the grace and then deny the rest of the message oh we put our lives on the grace but then we won't put our lives on the rest of the message now where are we at so it's for the you know I'll repeat this over and over because I want you to get it right it's for just this group only now we're found in this mess because of misinterpreted theology is that right that's why you women married the second time and you men because misinterpreted theology all right now that's no excuse to say well we didn't know well that's well you know now okay so it's misinterpreted theology okay now I want to show you something that he told me if God our creator was questioned the question when he was here on the earth Jesus Christ and when his delivering Prophet came forth Moses now in Egypt to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt to put them in the promised land and Jesus said here that Moses seen the people in this condition and he granted them a writing a divorcement because the situation I watch it it was a situation with what it was Moses found such as let him suffer God permitted Moses that Prophet sent to the people to Grant this writing a divorcement to them and in First Corinthians the the seventh chapter in the 12th through the 15th verse in the New Testament Prophet Paul who meant the same thing in the church and spoke this is I not the Lord that right because of the divorce condition it wasn't so from the beginning but Moses was permitted it and God recognized it righteousness all right now what and Paul also had a right when he found his church in that condition now you believe this to be true and believe it to come from God and by the Vindication of his cloud and his message that's brought me thus far should not God upon the mountain permit me to do the same thing to suffer you to go on the way you are and do it no more go with your wives and live in peace for the hour is late the coming of the Lord is at hand I'm watching hours late the coming of the Lord is at hand I lose it when he goes up sometimes that's all right we haven't got time to break these things up don't you dare try to do it again I'm speaking only to my congregation but if you are married and God bore me witness of that on the mountain that I could say this a supernatural revelation because of the opening of The Seven Seals and this is a question in God's word let them go on in as they are and sin no more all right now as I said people accept that and put their life on that but what about the rest of the message right right I believe in Two Souls I Believe In This I Believe in Us huh go ahead that's uh that's between you and God it's not me all right so now let's get to point and drive it hard it's only to the followers of the message not for just anyone in the days of Moses it was only for the people that followed the word of the hour for the day that Moses was living all right now watch it in a minute because I got it wrote in here it was only for the followers of Paul in his day and it's only father followers of the end time word of this age all right now but I want you to pick up this point and I may repeat this a couple of times notice one thing the grace of Moses was counted righteousness in the days of Moses but it was not sufficient are you listening for the days of Paul are you listening now if it hadn't been how old would have quoted Moses right right amen see don't ask him keep going we'll get to that while this word then more words and more word and more words all right now so keep that in your mind now this the the Moses Grace was not sufficient for Paul right in his day it had to be revealed to Paul neither was it sufficient for the end time even though this Prophet could read that and did speak of it and said God has done things before you know in the conduct order in her Doctrine messages but he could not speak it until God spoke to him right amen see that's where we think well we'll just read the word what I've read in the word we're free by the blood of Jesus Christ that's wonderful but has it been revealed all right now now it's only for the age when it's spoken now put this in here because I try to cover every point to keep people from having questions and and questions then I know what it does because you'll be preaching along and the question will come up in your mind and you don't hear the rest of the message because the question is the only thing you've got in your mind and your brain just doesn't operate in the order of it does to sit there and hear things but it doesn't work correctly so now I want to put this in there in the days of Moses which what I said about this this Romans 7 about being under the law you know the picked it up Romans 7 verse 7. see in the days of Moses the people who heard the grace it didn't have to be that they were sitting in the building when Moses spoke it that's right all right it wasn't that they were sitting in the building now some were sitting in the building all right yes and I heard what he said or remember where they were gathered but you don't have to be that because see just like even the Apostle Paul the the Apostle Paul what he spoke was the word of God all right now we were not back there when he spoke it that's right but we read it just like Paul is speaking to us right amen all right you hear it so you've been anybody in the Old Testament realm could have believed the the message of Moses and the grace of Moses and could have accepted that right and God could reveal it to them amen all right now you following me till then when you would come to the days of Paul and Paul in that word of that hour he was a lot of people there when he said what he said and a lot of people's read what he said that's right all right but you didn't have to be sitting there to receive it that's right amen see everybody wasn't sitting at the Tabernacle when the prophet spoke the grace of marriage and divorce right amen right but he didn't say that this is only for the people sitting in the building today right that's right he said it's only for the followers of the message amen all right then being the followers of the message Moses Grace would have been sufficient for that age but not sufficient for the next age because more word was unveiled or unfolding and coming back all right so Mo Paul and his grace would have been sufficient for the day and the people coming down could look at that that he had spoken right all right and it would be fine if they could have comprehended which nobody really preached it you know I don't know of any commentators uh Schofield mentions a little bit about what Paul was doing and and all but they didn't understand the grace of marriage and divorce that's right but see if somebody if God could have revealed it God could have set them free that's right now follow me but then when it come down to this age and the prophet began to speak see more is going to be required that's right all right so more being required then it would take God sending a prophet and as I said not being like it was that Paul would say Moses said right so we believe Moses amen that's good but see God spoke to Moses to Paul like I've always tried to cover it with with Peter over in the scripture you know he said I was up on the mountain I went up there and saw the Lord Jesus all these things but he said I have a more sure word of Prophecy what he had an experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right and see even Paul having the experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost maybe he's seen some of the things Moses spoke of maybe he had an understanding of beloved but one day God came to him to speak to his people right all right now that would have lasted down to time you can argue maybe with me on that point but still I believe it would have lasted on down until this Prophet came all right now when this Prophet came on the scene then Moore was going to be required amen and he didn't come out in the in the 50s and preach marriage and divorce he said our Supernatural Revelation because of the opening of The Seven Seals All right now your father what I'm getting at see all then let's cover it just like this Moses gave a natural Grace for natural things right no problems married wrong you know done wrong all right his was a natural all right but when Paul came along Hall found the church in his day messed up you know and he was in the book of Corinthians which means correction and he had to correct a lot of things in there because like the women preachers used to be preachers down the prophet said under the old goddesses and the different things and they got converted and they thought well we just go ahead and preach here well see he had to straighten out all of those things and doing it all right but then he had to give a natural Grace to the people as Moses had to you know gifted or put into the hands of the people but Paul done more than that because see Paul took the natural and he began to type it with the spiritual all right so that's why it was covered in in Romans now that's that's what I mean see um we we determined the only place we could find in in Moses Grace was Deuteronomy 24. well that doesn't mean the rest of Moses message wasn't right that's right all right so you're right number three times for this so then when Paul came along just because it would be First Corinthians um you know there uh ever what we reached seven through what uh First Corinthians or seventh chapter 12 through 15. oh we lay on that we believe that that's wonderful right but we don't know about this dress and hiring stuff and all that he said on over into here see all right see then look where you're getting to wait till we get this afternoon to see if that old husband is still alive that old husband is anything contrary to the word of God all right now but you get what my point of what I'm saying Hall brought it and Illustrated it right Joe then Romans 7 is part of Paul's message right that's right I know I'm just making it naturally caramel because I want you to think about it see then all the writings of Paul was Paul's message that's right so you could say well I believe all the Paul's message but I don't believe this well if you don't believe all of it you couldn't come under the grace of marriage and divorce that's my point right you don't get nothing out of the message today we get no further that's the point okay that if we don't believe all that brother Brown broth then we can't believe part of what he brought it what kind of a Bible would you have that you can believe part of it to be true that's right what kind of a message would you claim to be part of it to be true well we know where brother Reynold made a mistake yeah I don't know where he corrected them too yeah right and if he didn't correct them I want to see your your brainy Revelation to where you've got to write corrected hmm all right now so let's get down to a part of what we get now see then Paul took it as a natural to explain it right all right you'll notice if I've asked you to read marriage and divorce run around before he got to the grace part he explained the reason of why the situation was like it was yes all right see so Paul's message explains the reason of the the the reason he had to give a Grace all right you see Moses was explaining you know the natural Paul was explaining the natural typing it with the spiritual and saying that we could be no more married you know and her husband had to be dead just like it would be in being married to Christ all right now so then that would be a natural and then you would take a natural and going towards spiritual okay brother Brown took a natural good expression unto us you know because it's what it was the natural things that had been done yes yes brought it into a spiritual condition see the show Christ in the church and is to take it back to a natural see this ain't got to go to a natural that's why I've always said if we can't be set free by the grace of marriage and divorce then these bodies can't go into Rapture amen I've always preached that to you you know that they can't be a Rapture of these bodies if they can't be straightened out in this world your brother said whatever we are here we go there we're the same thing there so you couldn't say Well they're getting straightened up over there got me straightened up here or there won't be a change in the body so how do you know about your old husband brother hantus made a good point years ago and he used to make the statements kind of funny but it was a good state and he said like this he said it's not how many wives I've had he said there's how many husbands I've had right and I thought well that's a good point now that many wives maybe might be clear at that point but how many husbands have we had you know we'll get more on that this afternoon all right but brother Brown took it see from a a natural right then he gets into the invisible Union right the reason I've asked you to read that and he covers it going back towards a spiritual condition and then takes us right into the Eternal Lands of the millennium fun see because that's where we're going that's that's where you know we're going to the change in the in the things that are going to take place all right so then I brought a quote that I thought would be interested upon this point so go ahead with number two the Third x is paragraph 299 on 1963 uh 6 30. morning service the first Exodus what did he do he brought them out of a natural land to a natural land now think of the marriage and divorce or what I just said this is the what I'm using it for see Paul Moses was natural he took him from a natural land of Egypt to a natural land of Goshen you know the the the people of God all right the second Exodus he brought them from a spiritual condition see which would you Jesus Christ coming to setting up a spiritual condition into a spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost all right so that blows in with what Paul done said now he is bringing them from the spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost right back into the Eternal land of the Millennium and the greaterafter same Throne of Fire same anointing system same God doing the same thing the same word declared the same one declared the second the same word declared the second has declared the third one and here we see it among us all right so now Paul Moses gave a natural to a natural he took him from an actual land to a natural land he gave him a natural Grace of Mary Jane doors all right when Jesus Christ came on the Saints he was picking it up into a spiritual condition that's why they couldn't understand him when he was preaching and he turned them to a spiritual baptism in the Holy Ghost all right now so then Paul is laying his grace in with the natural and then he types it with a spiritual see backwards and forth so it's tying together to what we're talking about but see in this end time we're going from a spiritual baptism of the Holy Ghost right into the land of the Millennium back to Natural so Greta Brown's message would be natural setting us free and natural flesh but then it would tie into the spiritual condition of being set free to be able to carry us into a natural land all right because I believe it I believe not only is the grace of marriage and divorce we've got to be given for the body the human elements the sin of life I believe that the the grace of marriage and divorce goes all the way into covering spiritual condition that our old husband and who we were married to and what's going on and how he could be dead right all right well that's what we're going to get into more this afternoon but you see what the point of trying to get now all right now take on it we will be talking about the grace of marriage divorce now I just wrote my right moment you know I write my own notes I like to read them sometimes they sound pretty good I helped Anna write a pieces one time in college and we got a ninth grade education I have to write a thesis and in the statement to make a statement we'd do something then we make a statement I'm going to hit an old Professor he circled everyone in statement he said well said good morning I went here I am I pray all right so I like to make statements like this are we talking about the grace of marriage and divorce is it not really the grace from marriage and divorce is that not really what it is the Grace from to get away from that's right because their marriage was wrong divorce is wrong so wouldn't it be like we come to America for freedom of religion but it's not that it's freedom from religion we come to America for freedom from religion because that was our problem over there was religion all right that sure is it with marriage and divorce now all right here I've got it written again to cover that part right if marriage and divorce Grace is it just a few words we've read or we could read the scriptures and we could cover the prophet you know and do the thing is that all we see about it how can I keep saying over and over how can we claim to accept the grace of marriage and divorce when we don't believe what the prophet said right now all the prophets Prophets say it we don't believe the Bible how can we claim now I didn't say it's been revealed to us no don't but if anything's made known then it's capable of being revealed you agree right all right see now then as we come into it is it just a few words of Grace American door or is it the whole message that's why you go out the people has taken this message of of marriage and divorce and tried to teach it to denominational people or something it comes along and says something about they got a marital problem why don't you come to our church we can straighten that out now that that's that's that's going the wrong way once you come to the truth see the truth like I've always said you you see people and I watched this over 40 something years now you see people that get mad about and come out of organized religion because they see that it's wrong you'll see them going back and organizing themselves or going back into another church okay but if you see them come out on the Revelation and one true and living God most of the time they'll stay because they've got a foundation they've got something anchored within them all right remember now in the days of Paul it was only for the Believers that followed Paul's message this was in the days of Moses was only for the ones who followed his message and preached that all right and now it's only for those who follow this end time prophet's message it's not for everybody that's right it's not for everybody that picks up a spoken word book and reads it that's right right there's people in this message that probably when brother Brown preached I'm just giving an illustration because there's there's a polygam in this message there's uh bigamies and hickamies and all kind of I guess you call it but there's people in this message that's probably got two or three wives but when they first started they probably grabbed the grace of marriage and divorce for trying to get away from what they had I did not something now that we can twist the message you make it all right but now watch it had to be revealed I want this anchored in the days of Moses it was not now we've anchored that I hope over and over and over that Moses never gave a Grace for just any cause see that was what Jesus wouldn't even talk to the Pharisees when and then when they was asking him about it he didn't even answer their blunt question he just bypassed it by saying it wasn't so from the beginning that was settled it Moses never gave a Grace for just anything you'd mess up everything in the word of God you'd make a prophet greater than God's word Paul never gave a Grace of marriage and divorce for just everybody for everything amen remember what I tried to show you that the grace of marriage and divorce applies for what is past right right don't try to apply it to what's future that's right that's Catholicism right live for what's passed it's what we've done that's right we get forgiveness of it yes right for what we've done the grace of marriage and divorce with what which for what people had done not for what they were going to do right right see they made it for any cause and that way they could just do anything they wanted to with it right and say Moses said I believe it I believe everything Moses says but this right here when he said this I just don't believe that oh is that the way it is in this message I believe everything brought around said itself now I say and you don't argue with me do what you want to ain't gonna argue with nobody about this making mistakes you forget it if we can't accept this message entirely then the grace of marriage and divorce cannot be accepted because it was not given in the early parts of the message it was given over into the ending up with the message if we can't get that right and that's the point I want to drive in for a while a supernatural Revelation that's right because of the opening of the seventh seeds you understand what he's saying yes yes do you understand that statement yes a supernatural Revelation because of the opening of the seventh seed in other words if the Seven Seals had never been broke they would have never been a supernatural revelation of marriage and divorce does that understood yes right you get it yeah yes if the seals had never been broken if the word of God had not been revealed to the prophet they would not been a Grace of marriage and divorce do you understand yes yes well how many people understands the seals when brother Ramos did marriage and divorce was revealed and sealed sir he said serpency was revealing a sealed separate seeds preacher 58. amen and yet he said it was revealed in the seal that thing was revealed in the seals because that's the old thing of the worm right he brought Iran's message now proved it over and over to you like in the Rapture message he said not in the beginning but when the when he begins to sound his his message runaround's message didn't begin until after this with the breaking of the seals is where the sick message begun the other was restoration back to what Paul and him had preached in the Bible that's right so you're following that point not going with it yes all right now here's what I want you to think about and we will be talking about the grace of marriage and divorce really the Grace from marriage and divorce but remember it's only for those who can accept the message of the age they were living in or we're living in now yes all right now and it is only for those the message has been revealed to to accepting the message is one point right said right around with the prophet one point but has it been revealed to it that's what we want to deal with right see it must be revealed to the people of the age and not to just be able to read what the prophet is saying right see why I said we want a few words of the grace you know but we don't want the rest of the message oh we we will fight you about the few words of Grace and God forgive me for saying a few words I'm just meaning that it was a uh about 50 pages of marriage and divorce and then he takes a half a page to explain the grace and what God spoke to him see it must be revealed to the people the age not to just quoted all right now the denominations read the Bible I don't mean that I mean all you know this message and everything I just put it all in one lump they read the Bible and say it's for them right but has it been revealed yes it's been revealed to us it's been revealed to me today Street College I can see it I I couldn't see that before but I can see it now it's been revealed to me well now did that come from God or the devil that's right that's right now you answered the part but get the the point of what I'm saying yes people read the Bible and say it's been revealed right heard a man one time he just come in the message and probably hadn't met him but just a I'm in a very short time and probably hadn't even read to see a book but he had heard the quote and he said boy ain't it something when them seals broke and the Bible become a brand new book that's easy to quote isn't it they become a brand new book thank you thank you but get that and it'll be better for this afternoon about the old husband all right we read the message we claim the message to be true but has it been revealed to us I believe the grace of God has to be revealed whether it be for our uh you know a new birth see or whether it be for marriage and divorce see grace is unmerited favor we lay a lot on that point but then we think about it as Grace being the point that God has revealed right you remember running around talking about it with white Moody that read Romans 7 and when I run out in the streets you know him first man he come to me he said do you know Grace and then I said Grace who he said the grace of God that set him free he's seen it by Revelation about the grace of God setting him free right have you seen it about the grace of God setting you free from your old sins okay or is that just a quote see grace is actually the revelation of God's word which is his will that's right and Willis's word that he has extended to us no matter what we're asking about you know healing sounds wonders whatever uh Revelation you know it's revealed to us that's right it's mine it belongs to me all right see the reveal word now not just the letter but Paul said to let her kill it that's right and like I've always tried to explain to you that people say well you know pour over the bad news this way they preach poor old Nicodemus must be born again and poor Nicodemus couldn't understand that I only had two good one Lord Jesus Christ your body you know that's what that's why the priest is just you know saying that Nicodemus he just couldn't understand well all you got to do is believe when Nicodemus believe put his life on the line his job was on the line they caught him out there where he's at it black ball out right right but you see we just say well I please the message but has it been revealed to you that's right you know what's the point we won't have to pull this back up but down at the end of the the message that we gave you on we pulled up where the Prophet was talking about and he said a supernatural revelation because of the opening of The Seven Seals I can say this he said now what does that mean to you a supernatural revelation I mean I don't want a definition of Supernaturals and Revelation now I'm asking what it means to you right I I kind of read you know I want to know what it means to you is this Supernatural Revelation that was given to the prophet was it something that was not in the word are you listening was it something that's not in the word or was it in the word but light had not shined on it come on we know it wasn't revealed to man right down through there delighted not shiny remember the the pyramid Mountain the prophet Top Cut Off looks down in sees the thing come back preachers to see open on and they said run around and said well your ability you said you could write on what is the 23rd chapter of Revelation or something like that he said see there they were trying to trap me right he said coach you can't add one word that's right well the supernatural Revelation the prophet received he said was because of the opening of the seventh seals something was revealed to him because the sealed had been broke yes but it couldn't be nothing contrary a different message or whatever you know that's right so when the prophet came along this message started with the opening of the seal tonight was that a different message from what all the other was no no sure it was we'll get to it in a minute it was the Capstone the finality the Finish yes true but the prophet said you can't add one word amen to the Bible he said it was the things that was in the Bible all right so the grace of marriage and divorce was in the Bible so the prophet and being a prophet and you go back and conduct order and Doctrine in 64 there before the marriage and divorce and you'll hear him saying that things go on as you are right here don't do nothing until you hear from me we read them the other day yes said to eat something yes he knew something would happen but he couldn't just go out and speak it that's right let's go and God revealed it to me I'll just go speaking you know you you got a problem that's right go ahead dude you get things premature and then you speak a little bit about what he's saying and the rest of it he's a blabber of our mouths that's right all right so my point is what a supernatural Revelation because of the opening of the seventh seal the Seven Seals couldn't add anything to the Bible so then the supernatural revelation of marriage and divorce could not be something added to the Bible it would have to be what the Bible was speaking of right right but no man had seen it like that that's right and was able to speak it all right so then the Sea of had to be opened before marriage and divorce could be preached right see it was in the word but not revealed yes hmm until God opened the word and brought us the entire Bible then it could be done all right now Supernatural revelation what do you think he's talking about well it's this this it was this great Revelation that he got could it be contrary to the word could in any way this Prophet had his talks to the word if he did then he messed it up right so it had to be written had to be what was written in the word amen so you can't add to the word is that true so it must be what was written in or type that's right in the word of God but not made alive to us and the reason I say written type see was written in the or type in the word see there was a lot of types and shadows back there that were not clear enough to work that you could read it as thinking it was the word right you know what I'm saying the letter right so it would be a type this yes they would speak or something all right David in his marriage of you know where Solomon won with a thousand wives was a type that's right o Christ in the church all right so it would be part of the word but yet not the word because it was not so from the beginning and never was supposed to been that way that's right so a type can be in there that you can see it but a top is always something that's like a canoe is a type of a big ocean liner boats you know a ship thing yes and you know so you have to be careful the way you type um you know brother Al that time we was down in Atlanta and this brother typed the road he lived on and the way he come to church and where he done this and where he done that and they all looked the back of his car and said what on the top is tag number his tag number was 666. and you know all right let's see if we can talk and I know one brother I heard as a matter of fact I believe it was the same one but anyhow they were typing one time and they was talking about median I want to see which one's the last one meeting um right around his wife maybe they typed it back there and they said at that time she was still living so she there said me you'll never die well she did was that one right but now God's types ain't that way that's right God typed through his types are right that's right amen you know they're speaking or something that will finality come into being all right now a supernatural revelation is the word of God Made Alive to you amen so what was it to the prophet the word Was Made Alive and then God could you speak through the conscience of a man and say see what Paul Moses done see what Paul done right you go tell them to go on now was that brother Branham or was that God speaking which one is it we know the man's voice was used we know the lips was used we know all of those things but was that God would Paul when he was saying uh not I but the Lord and the Lord not the Lord but I you know was he taking all that power on his control or what was he now I want to show you more this afternoon on it but I want you to think about it did Moses on the grace of marriage and divorce did he have as the mind of Christ as always can speak it right right so he run around a whole lot more than what you think about him as he's saying well Moses was the type of Christ when he said I'll stand in the way don't you think that was Christ and Moses that was speaking to Grace for those people don't you think it was Christ in Paul that could say more than Moses because Paul was a borned against Christian and a prophet to the age of church-aged messenger Etc and he had the mind of Christ how much more sure would the grace that Paul spoke be more than what Moses spoke people tied together into the spiritual all right what about this end time prophet it was not only a prophet he was a church age messenger he was a born-again Believer surely we know he had to mind the Christ he was adopted manifested son of God and had the caption of Revelation amen how much more will God keep his word in the end times we can believe it and understand what a supernatural Revelation is right right all right let's get a couple of quotes on something before we get too far okay go ahead brother pull up number three this is taken from the message super sign uh 61-40 30. paragraph e 31. he's talking about Abraham and she was in the Super the way he chose to come to show in this last day God super signed a super race oh yes not what you call a super race but what God calls super race because they got what Supernatural power now listen we're Supernatural Shine That's not the bad side that's all I see through a supernatural belief in a supernatural word from a supernatural God you talk about super we Supernatural God in the Supernatural body in a natural people giving Supernatural shine Hallelujah yes a super race When You Believe in a supernatural God do you believe in a supernatural word but we're in there right here Supernatural word yes but brother Dale those things are only for the prophet you sure are cutting yourself all this connection that's your choice go ahead this is taken from the voice of God in his last days 1963 one uh uh 120 Des Moines service paragraph 32. and the true voice of God can only bring back that real living Supernatural god with his Supernatural word with the supernatural manifestation of the word then we know it's the voice of God Supernatural look at the nation what is a supernatural revelation look what your seals were this is on the third seal paragraph 294 63 320 on the third seal three of them so far has absolute have been absolutely supernaturally revealed that's right now here is the mystery of this black horse when it what it was revealed to me he said it's supernatural reveal yeah we can understand that brother Dale that's only for the the prophet of Supernatural revelation is only for brother Brown no look at the last number six I imagine I will order short 55 626 the union service paragraph E4 24. watch this now watch those two Spirits rise in Genesis if we had time we could take the night coming to take the night coming through the Bible showing those two Spirits now look what Cain done when he seen his brother was accepted his brother had the supernatural revelation and it was Josh over him and shot a way to kill him the label had a supernatural revelation see we put it only that the prophet has a supernatural revelation all right I believe all Revelation is Supernatural all Revelation It's Supernatural amen any Revelation you receive is Supernatural because natural won't do you any good that's just reading the letter off the page that's right and see that's easy to do once you say well we've been around this message like my wife says we've been in this message along to you ought to be able to about anybody ought to be able to sit down and take a topic and and write out a a a a speech and cover it through brother Brown I'm going to quote this and quote that and quote this and quote that and just you know line it up and give you a whole list of things we've been around it so long yes right what about when God revealed itself to you as the only true of God amen that was Supernatural Abel had a revelation that he was born in his mindless blood from his daddy's blood now and give you that quote and run around if you want but Cain had a revelation he thought he had a supernatural revelation he thought it was offering fruit that's right but Abel had a supernatural Revelation your Prophet said what he was born in his mama's blood from his daddy's blood when he tried to explain that to Cain Cain got mad and killed him you go out now and try to explain serpent seed to people they'll crucify you right now and they'll quote you the Bible yes right you go out and try to explain one God to people and they'll quote you the Bible in history that's right that's what I was saying a while ago come on if you remember the denomination is claimed to believe the Bible amen they said I got a supernatural Revelation there's got to be three Gods people even says and I get to Heaven Ain't three so I'll turn around and leave across the wrong place see that's how arrogant and things we become now we're going to get to that this afternoon and see if the old husband is dead amen you see if a dumb donkey live on a preacher a dumb donkey corrected a man one time a prophet right that's right amen now the dumb donkey speaks to you and you deny that and won't accept it then your old husband's Not Dead that's the reason you accept it that way we'll get to that this afternoon amen but I just wanted you to see Kane had a supernatural revelation of a supernatural God who had a supernatural word and when he revealed that to you it's your revelation he called all Revelation is Supernatural in all Revelation is the grace of God amen you agree the grace of God extended down to you and I am no matter if it's one little words you've received that's wonderful that's great Brother Gary and I don't talk another day about it if the Lord shows you something just stay there I'm trying to figure it out you mess it up just stay right in that realm and study and pray in that rim you know and just wait for the Lord to lead you out a little further that's right but thank God he's already gave you something yeah I mean because you gotta admit that you didn't have this prior to then so if he give you something to get you started though stay right time I wouldn't preach on things for many many years and I can give you a quote for everything in it you know there are quotes I used later was the very quotes but still it was not revealed when I speak to you you better believe one thing it's been revealed to me if it ain't I'll tell you in a hurry no problem see because it's a supernatural revelation but this Supernatural Revelation now listen listen to me for a few minutes see Paul will have Supernatural Revelation right Peter James John them to writings of the Bible they wrote what God told him what it was right but they didn't understand the Seven Seals that even John the writer didn't understand see because there was something to be revealed in the end time amen right right and it would take then a prophet not another Paul that was wonderful Paul understands that when I say that and I'm not derogatory to it but he was a PO he was a prophet only through the file for Ministry forms and set aside for his day of that you know Apostle Prophet Evans and the church age mentioned everything but this Prophet was greater than all that's right he was greater than all the prophets is that the way he said that you've been given more gifts in any of the prophets only the Lord Jesus could stand and say the things this Prophet the end time would say when he say bring me 24 of your worst cases and I'll guarantee you healing for every one of them that's his work but he wasn't gone so when God used a man's lips to speak his grace to you and I we thank God did the prophet say say thank you to no man that's right that's right now he didn't mean don't pat him on the back and don't say thank you that was a good message I enjoyed it you know come on put it all together we're the man on the on the train you know riding he said I saved God's money took a chair in other words you know just a regular old seat bench or what you call it he said I took a birth back there a bed and saved God's man well you don't believe in God no he's just honest he got a good nice rash thank God for the ranch you understand what I'm saying a supernatural revelation see if anything been revealed to you I keep saying that over and over and over anything to be revealed to hear me either one that's Supernatural um wow we know it comes our way of the Prophet that's right right we believe in that right it come by way of the Prophet amen we don't claim nothing didn't come you know it was on its own but to show you something that'll tell you this afternoon I heard about a man the other day that quit a church and when he was contacted about it he said well this ain't none of y'all can explain it the brother asked him said what do you believe brother Brown could explain he said no that he couldn't explain he asked him said well do you do you believe that you've gone beyond brother Brown the man said yes I have see that's how much a husband can take you and Lead You Off the word amen an old denominational idea a husband or a thought you saw can't happen to me as a lot of people said that right would you ever thought that Oral Roberts Pentecostal man would have ever stepped down and become a Methodist evangelist thank you I'm not throwing off on here man I do need it to me and you you know what I'm talking about you see a lot of people in this message they swore by this message but when 77 come around they left the message any little thing it took just to lead them away and fall away from the message when they would one day fight you over the fact that they believed everything the prophet said have we got a supernatural revelation like I told you about that brother that time when I was preaching you know on the field and I said this is my revelation the brother sent me words said brother Brown's y'all want to have the revelation he said my Revelation is that brother Branham had your revelation I never sent the word back to him or nothing never said nothing because I'd like for you to explain what he said I said I had a revelation let's see if my Revelation is correct if it feels like the prophet said it's all right he said he had a revelation Libra Brown had a real life you don't understand he was saying I was wrong for saying I had a revelation he said he had a revelation I said I had a revelation his Revelation wrote around his own one had a revelation but see the man was real quick to want the grace of marriage and divorce maybe for something he needed or whatever you understand my point because of the opening of the entire Bible to the prophet God could speak to him about Moses his grace and Paul's Grace and then he could speak and give a Grace to You and I now as I said in the message partner I believe it I believe we need the grace of marriage and divorce on a spiritual condition more than we do in a natural that's right because you may not be guilty of a natural condition right but we're all guilty of a spiritual condition that's right we've all had the wrong husband and to be married to Christ without that husband being dead that denomination that idea then we're an adulterish read invisible Union and say we will read most of it this afternoon but thank all these things come on musician think on these things well only the prophet had Supernatural revelation you see we take those things and we say well I believe so much of the message I believe this now how can we claim the grace of marriage and divorce if we don't believe everything that the man brought to us and you know what I mean by that when he was preaching the white horse rider was the Holy Ghost he was wrong but he corrected it right he correct that's right nobody else corrected him God correctly how are we free if we've been married two or three times about what thing can God do this is for the afternoon what can he do to make us free they did not break the word what can that part be quiet brother what do we got let's stay 372. 372 Inspire book anybody have a knee you asked me why I'm happy okay foreign foreign accuse you he's a liar right he's a bluff they'll just call this Bluff thank you you know I have to do that a long time that's called his bluff and he tells me so you're lost I said well okay that makes two others lost so I mean you both off now what we're gonna do well he just gets away and it finally gets a blazes ah he's just crazy well maybe I am and I certainly love the Lord certainly believe his word amen amen don't you like on these things a supernatural revelation and remember what I kept saying over and over I believe all revelation of the word of God whether it be serpent seed one God no eternal hell whatever be revealed to you that is Supernatural when it's revealed yes it is it's not just a natural thing it's supernatural don't belittle the word and just say only the prophet had a supernatural revelation It's Supernatural Revelation came because he had had many many many many many many many many many many Supernatural Revelations of God coming forward and then it was brought into a place to say I say a supernatural because of the opening of the word has the word open to you and I that's why I just keep preaching and don't you know people don't understand me I just keep preaching just keep preaching hammering on something try to get us to see it appreciate it go back three or four five years later go back preach on again why because I just want us to get it father we thank you for this day and the hour that we live upon the Earth and we thank you for your word that's been revealed unto us and we pray that you would just bless us now give us understanding of you and Lord help us to see you revealed in your work give us the supernatural Revelation Lord of your grace new love got us now this mission bring us back together this afternoon in you in Jesus name you just there is all to my heart don't go away
