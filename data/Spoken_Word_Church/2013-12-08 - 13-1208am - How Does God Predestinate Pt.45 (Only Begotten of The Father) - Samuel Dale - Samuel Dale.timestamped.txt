[6:41] missing in the reasons why all right so
[6:44] remember that
[6:46] now the little baby that we were praying

[6:52] remember the little baby out in New
[6:55] Mexico that uh you know Rachel and EMS
[7:00] uh what is his name David David and her
[7:05] he's you know and the little girl had to
[7:09] tree things he holds in her heart when
[7:12] she was born well they were worried
[7:14] because really when they did find out
[7:16] that it was worse than they thought and
[7:19] she could have died at any time with
[7:21] what they had but God took care of her
[7:23] and said she came through the operation
[7:26] you know had the temperature is going
[7:29] down everything's okay now so we thank
[7:32] God for the healing virtues because we
[7:36] believe it all right and just keep
[7:38] praying for her now because she's still
[7:40] got a lot of a lot of problems and
[7:42] things but you know God's on his way
[7:44] okay now remember they will not be I'm
[7:47] trying to make these announcements where

[7:56] Wednesday service that week
[7:59] all right
[8:00] the watch not service will be on
[8:02] December the 31st
[8:04] which is on Tuesday
[8:07] all right so there will not be a
[8:10] Wednesday service that week
[8:13] all right because that would be the
[8:15] first of January okay any other
[8:19] announcements I generally forget
[8:20] something
[8:21] but just remember these announcements
[8:24] and things and all but you know pray to
[8:26] the Lord would bless and guide each one
[8:29] okay
[8:30] anything else I need to announce
[8:33] okay Romans 8
[8:37] and
[8:39] we're going to first John
[8:42] 4
[8:43] 7-10 but Romans 8. it's where we've been
[8:47] reading from
[8:49] and we pray that the Lord would add his
[8:52] Blessing to the reading of the word
[8:55] is think about these things we've read
[8:57] this 44 times
[9:00] but we still not run out yet
[9:03] so then don't worry about it we just
[9:04] keep reading it you know in doing it
[9:07] let's pray father we thank you we love
[9:09] you we just ask you Lord to be with us
[9:12] today in your loving grace and give each
[9:14] and every one of us your love Lord
[9:17] your lot
[9:19] and let each one Lord receive from you
[9:22] because we believe you and we thank you
[9:25] we just ask you to have your way Lord in
[9:28] our hearts and our lives and
[9:31] that you would show us your word
[9:34] that is it opens unto us then we learn
[9:36] to walk therein
[9:38] have your way in forgive our sins bless
[9:40] those that are not here the sick ones
[9:43] Lord touch each one and may your love be
[9:46] with each and every one of us we love
[9:48] you and we thank you in Jesus name amen
[9:50] also before forget it there are some
[9:54] notes up here from last night's Bible
[9:56] study the topic of last night's Bible
[9:59] study was the eight manifestations of
[10:03] God Seven Church ages
[10:07] seven
[10:09] angels
[10:12] but eight manifestations of God if you
[10:15] don't get that you're going to miss the
[10:16] whole thing an entirely Miss where
[10:19] brother Brown says the messenger comes
[10:21] at the end of the age
[10:23] now did Paul come at the end of Ephesus
[10:28] if he did how could he bring the message
[10:30] to Ephesus
[10:33] and anybody out there we're
[10:35] like you know I know we're sarcastic but
[10:39] we do know too that The Messengers you
[10:41] can't place their births their life
[10:43] inside of the ages a lot of time it may
[10:46] be over here it may be over here so
[10:48] let's quote random he said the messenger
[10:51] to each age was the messenger of that
[10:54] age
[10:55] that
[10:56] spoke for God and in great
[10:58] manifestations brought the message of
[11:01] that time
[11:03] all right the one who would be the
[11:05] greatest or the closest to the word
[11:07] would be the messenger of the age
[11:08] because you can't figure those you take
[11:10] the ages and try to get their verses
[11:12] when they were born and when they died
[11:14] you can't Brew it
[11:16] all right
[11:17] so just as I said the other day why why
[11:20] do we always have to figure everything
[11:21] out
[11:23] will that happen on December the 31st on
[11:25] three o'clock well no it wasn't at four
[11:27] o'clock
[11:29] see we got to be so smart ethically know
[11:31] it all
[11:33] take the message and believe it
[11:37] and see what God can do for each and
[11:39] every one of us all right now I'm sorry
[11:42] that's just me okay
[11:45] Romans 8.
[11:47] and we know that all things work
[11:49] together for good to them that love God
[11:50] to them who are thee called according to
[11:52] his purpose for whom he did for no he
[11:55] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[11:58] the image of his son that he might be
[12:00] the first born among many brethren
[12:03] or over whom he did predestinate then he
[12:06] also called in whom he called him he
[12:08] also justified in whom he justified them
[12:11] he also glorified what shall we then say
[12:14] to these things
[12:15] if God be for us who can be against us
[12:18] great statement right
[12:20] first John 4
[12:23] 7. through 10.
[12:26] beloved
[12:27] let us love
[12:30] one another
[12:33] for love is of God and everyone that
[12:35] loveth is born of God and North God
[12:39] you know love covers the multitude of
[12:41] sin so I don't have any problems if you
[12:44] love me you're going to look over my
[12:46] thoughts and failures
[12:47] you know what because I got to look over
[12:49] yours
[12:52] okay we're all in the same boat
[12:55] all right
[12:58] he that loveth not
[13:00] knoweth not God
[13:02] for God is love
[13:04] and this was manifest the love of God
[13:06] toward us
[13:08] because that God sent his only begotten
[13:10] son into the world
[13:12] that we might live through him
[13:16] herein is love
[13:18] not that we love God but he loved us and
[13:22] sent his son to be the perpetuation
[13:24] for our sins you may be seated the Lord
[13:26] had his Blessing to the reading of the
[13:29] word now this past Wednesday
[13:33] I felt led to just read and we did of a
[13:36] vast amount out of the church age book
[13:39] about the predestinations and the things
[13:42] we've been talking about and doing and I
[13:46] hope you enjoyed it if not getting to
[13:49] listen to it I'd ask you to listen to it
[13:51] and uh that way it's just like I was
[13:54] saying about the eight manifestations of
[13:56] God last night if you want that copy
[14:00] you know just send us a note we'll try
[14:02] to send it to you because we do copy all
[14:04] of it but we couldn't do it with the
[14:06] screen to show what we were drawing so
[14:09] if you want to know something just ask
[14:10] us we'll try to help you the best we can
[14:12] all right because we want to you know
[14:14] get everything in the right order but
[14:17] we're talking about how does God
[14:18] predestinate
[14:22] now we know he predestinates by his
[14:26] foreknowledge
[14:29] he would at all be saved
[14:32] all right he doesn't predestinate we
[14:35] gave it we've read it over and over the
[14:37] prophet said he doesn't predestinate by
[14:39] his desires because he desired everybody
[14:41] to be saved
[14:43] well it was just he's specially picked
[14:46] now if he's specially picked the people
[14:49] the way you're saying it
[14:51] then he's the author of confusion
[14:54] and you can't connect it with the
[14:55] prophet's message so that you know go
[14:57] and do what you want to because you are
[14:58] anyway it's not going to change anything
[15:00] unless God speaks to our heart all right
[15:04] now
[15:05] then
[15:07] doing it we we covered our Wednesday
[15:09] that that it was necessary
[15:13] the end that God come himself
[15:19] all right amen
[15:22] brother Branham said and I've got these
[15:25] laying here if you desire them
[15:28] he says on paragraph
[15:31] 129 of the revelation of Jesus Christ
[15:34] and I'm going to ask him to pull them up
[15:36] I just got a quotes on some of it
[15:38] brother Ron said he couldn't trust
[15:40] nobody
[15:41] with it
[15:44] but brother tell you just don't
[15:45] understand
[15:48] we believe in the Trinity a father a son
[15:50] and a Holy Ghost and they can trust each
[15:52] other
[15:58] you believe what you want to
[16:02] but the prophet said he couldn't trust
[16:04] nobody else
[16:07] so he came himself
[16:11] and see we say well we didn't you know
[16:13] you just you're just so carnal
[16:15] I agree but I can at least they want the
[16:18] prophet said
[16:20] he said he couldn't trust nobody
[16:22] so he came himself
[16:24] who came God Almighty came down
[16:28] in human flesh
[16:31] to pay the price but you said but
[16:33] brother Dale like I said Wednesday you
[16:35] said but my God can't die
[16:39] and you're saying he died
[16:42] how many quotes you need from the
[16:43] prophet where he said God died
[16:46] now you're arguing with him
[16:48] how many scriptures you want out of the
[16:50] Bible
[16:52] where it talks about that he was
[16:54] almighty God
[16:56] right
[16:58] and then you're going to deny it he died
[17:02] hey we got enough sense to know
[17:05] great Eternal God
[17:07] cannot die
[17:09] so that's why he brought a flesh into
[17:12] being
[17:13] that's it right there amen
[17:16] see then he could remove the life out of
[17:19] the flesh
[17:20] and the flesh died
[17:23] as I always say
[17:25] I can cut your head off
[17:28] but I can't kill you
[17:31] your soul just steps out of that body
[17:33] right into another dimension right
[17:37] that's right well see we got it all
[17:39] figured out so we people say my God
[17:41] can't die well boy rush so and so
[17:44] straighten him out God can't die
[17:46] right around said he died in flesh
[17:50] all right you argued the point with him
[17:52] I don't have no problems with it so I'm
[17:54] not going to argue with you about it
[17:57] I'm just going to say what kind of a
[17:59] gospel you've got
[18:01] because we've got the only
[18:04] religion in the world
[18:06] that required that our God had to die
[18:11] now you say well brother there what
[18:12] happened okay I believe it's the
[18:14] unveiling of God if you want a technical
[18:16] quote
[18:18] brother random said he acted the part of
[18:23] death
[18:25] yeah man
[18:26] now that's your words if you want that
[18:28] we'll be glad to find it
[18:30] acted the part of death why because
[18:33] we're in the actual play right
[18:37] around said he tore that soul out of
[18:39] that body it was hanging on Calvary
[18:44] he said in body he was a man
[18:47] but said in spirit he was God Amen he
[18:50] said in body he was a man but said in
[18:53] Soul he was God
[18:57] all right
[18:58] so God came down
[19:03] to
[19:04] live in a human body that Hebrews 10 5
[19:07] he had created
[19:10] and when he did he just simply stepped
[19:13] right back out of that body
[19:16] amen
[19:17] what kind of a Doctrine have you got
[19:19] what are you going to feed it out
[19:22] do you see that away then I'm not a
[19:24] Oneness
[19:27] but I'm not a trinity
[19:32] because that God
[19:36] in human flesh
[19:40] he
[19:42] would make a way for you and I
[19:46] run around and said he couldn't send a
[19:48] son
[19:51] you want the quotes are laying here
[19:53] he didn't send a sign said he came in
[19:55] South
[19:58] all right that's according to whether we
[20:00] believe in one God or not
[20:05] but even if you say you don't believe in
[20:07] one God how are you going to explain
[20:08] that
[20:11] you mean God sent a son
[20:17] now what about your Eternal sonship then
[20:19] because that's your trinitarian Doctrine
[20:20] isn't it
[20:22] God the Father God the son God the Holy
[20:24] Ghost co-equal and co-eternal how can a
[20:28] son be co-equal with a father
[20:30] and how can a son that it means it had a
[20:32] beginning
[20:34] be eternal
[20:37] so the body had a beginning
[20:43] but that soul in that spirit that
[20:45] stepped into that body when he came into
[20:47] the world according to the Bible said
[20:49] it was God with us Emmanuel
[20:53] all right
[20:56] see
[21:02] the prophet said would you send somebody
[21:03] to die in your place
[21:06] well yeah I would well then you're not a
[21:08] good daddy
[21:10] yeah no
[21:12] forget it
[21:15] but he didn't send somebody else he came
[21:18] himself
[21:20] now I wish you would go home and run in
[21:23] only begotten
[21:25] now there's Old Testament scriptures
[21:27] referring to other people and so and so
[21:29] was the only begotten
[21:31] but just run into your Bible and the
[21:33] only begotten
[21:35] we just read that he was the only
[21:37] begotten
[21:41] right now
[21:43] if that's true
[21:45] that he's the only begotten
[21:49] of the father
[21:51] he
[21:53] then where are we at
[21:57] only begotten
[22:00] the word begotten means to
[22:03] um procreate or
[22:06] or in other words like a father
[22:08] that ability for children to come forth
[22:11] then is called and
[22:14] begotten
[22:16] and brother random said Adam was
[22:18] straight from the hand of God by
[22:20] creation
[22:22] he said but Jesus was the only begotten
[22:25] right
[22:27] look that up
[22:30] when you're saying only begotten
[22:33] look it up to see
[22:35] it literally means the only wand that
[22:38] came that way
[22:41] is that sensible
[22:44] yeah if you're saying they only begotten
[22:47] it means the only one that came that way
[22:50] now Adam came by creation
[22:53] sure
[22:55] right
[22:57] but Jesus was the only begotten
[23:03] right
[23:05] all right the only begotten
[23:09] would mean that he's the only one that
[23:12] was begotten now you and I
[23:16] come forth because that he
[23:19] fulfilled his part and said to eternal
[23:22] life and then he could beget many sons
[23:26] right
[23:28] but if he was the only begotten that
[23:30] means he's the only one the only one
[23:33] ever be that way
[23:36] because you and I come as sinners
[23:38] and have to be born again amen right
[23:40] right but then if it can be get or bring
[23:44] us on to the place because the word
[23:45] beget or begot
[23:47] really bored but God's not the
[23:49] scriptures begotten the word beget
[23:52] is begotten
[23:54] or begotten is beget
[23:56] all right
[23:57] which means the only one
[24:01] that ever was and the only one that'll
[24:04] ever be
[24:08] because you and I didn't come virgin
[24:10] born
[24:13] right
[24:15] but he was
[24:17] he come virgin born because he was
[24:19] created
[24:21] in the wound of Mary
[24:25] said he was begotten of a woman
[24:29] wow
[24:34] but then he explains what it means
[24:38] the blood of almighty God
[24:41] whatever you want to call it germ sperm
[24:43] egg whatever
[24:45] to bring forth that body
[24:48] was straight from almighty God as
[24:51] begotten amen and nobody else I don't
[24:53] care how good you think you are are
[24:56] going to be one day
[24:59] it'll still be that he's the only
[25:01] begotten
[25:03] all right
[25:04] then we must have him to bring us to
[25:08] that place that's what I was trying to
[25:09] bring our wins to see
[25:12] the only begotten
[25:14] means
[25:17] nobody else coming that away
[25:20] all right amen
[25:21] is that sensible
[25:24] I'm accused of being so deep
[25:26] of what
[25:29] I say I'm so I'm too simple
[25:32] because I tried to explain it
[25:36] deep people don't try to explain what
[25:38] they're saying because they want you to
[25:40] keep thinking how good how deep they are
[25:43] so when somebody says I got a mystery
[25:45] but I can't explain it
[25:51] you automatically know you got a problem
[25:57] there's plenty of mysteries in the Bible
[25:58] I can't explain
[26:02] but what's been revealed to me I can
[26:05] explain it
[26:06] and so can you that's right amen all
[26:09] right
[26:10] around said there's one thing you can do
[26:12] you can tell how the candle got lit
[26:15] right
[26:17] so you can tell that
[26:19] and if God reveals himself to you as
[26:21] I've always said about sister Birds when
[26:23] I preached that night hour and a half
[26:25] trying to explain
[26:27] did he come from God and he went to God
[26:29] and going back home at night and this
[26:31] sister couldn't even she wouldn't even
[26:33] have a vacuum cleaner she swept the
[26:34] floor
[26:35] the only stove she had had to have a
[26:37] button on the button off washers or
[26:39] everything everything had to because we
[26:40] had to go with her to buy them
[26:42] and we was going home at night she said
[26:44] brother Dale I see what you're talking
[26:46] about I said okay sis
[26:48] she said he come from God and he went to
[26:50] God said he was God the whole time
[26:52] wasn't he
[26:54] I said I wish I'd let you preached
[26:57] I spent an hour and a half trying to
[26:59] explain that she put it in two words or
[27:01] three
[27:03] yeah see because she got a revelation
[27:06] a lot of difference when we get a
[27:07] revelation or something man all right
[27:09] but think about it now
[27:11] he never sent a son he came himself
[27:16] how many quotes do you need of that I'll
[27:18] be glad to give you these notes after
[27:19] the service and over these quotes here
[27:21] and you can copy all you want to
[27:24] because if I'm not saying what he's
[27:25] saying then I need to be gotten out of
[27:27] the way
[27:28] run around said it was a neat um
[27:30] paragraph let's start on this number six
[27:33] let's do that
[27:35] let's start on number six Brother
[27:36] Anderson
[27:39] I guess he's back there he's missing
[27:43] this is paragraph 104 and 105 the god
[27:46] rich in Mercy 1965. 119. look what he
[27:50] says
[27:52] this was to be an eternal
[27:55] atonement
[27:58] now what about an eternal atonement
[28:01] you remember the sacrifice of the
[28:03] animals they could only cover sin right
[28:05] right but we have an eternal
[28:08] amen sacrifice
[28:10] that's what I depend on
[28:12] amen why because he was made eternal
[28:15] so whatever I need body spirit and soul
[28:17] I got an eternal Covenant
[28:21] when I really tell you you don't
[28:22] understand it's only Everlasting you
[28:25] don't understand either it's eternal
[28:28] amen it's just Everlasting because
[28:30] that's where we're here when we get dire
[28:32] we don't need to have a because what
[28:34] we're going to be willing with it okay
[28:37] this was to be an eternal atonement
[28:40] because he came himself God came himself
[28:42] in the form of sinful flesh look to make
[28:46] a a
[28:47] Eternal atonement and suffered In the
[28:49] Flesh and made the atonement and
[28:51] returned back in the form of the Holy
[28:54] Ghost
[28:56] to confirm that atonement
[28:59] we're no bright surferred or no troubles
[29:02] Waters
[29:04] he's not throwing off on those two that
[29:06] was in the Bible the bride serpent was
[29:08] right the troubled waters was right
[29:11] but that was only temporarily
[29:14] it all pointed to that perfect atonement
[29:17] God rich in his Mercy has did this
[29:20] right an eternal atonement yes
[29:24] yes why would we worry about it then
[29:27] why are you concerned whether well I
[29:29] don't know whether I made it no we
[29:31] didn't make it he did I'm not dependent
[29:34] on whether I make it or not I'm
[29:37] dependent on whether he made it
[29:44] but he says
[29:46] I'm not depending on it
[29:49] right
[29:54] look what it turned out to be let's read
[29:56] a little scripture
[29:58] Matthew 1 21-23
[30:01] let's just read a little bit
[30:04] and she shall bring forth a son and I
[30:06] shall call his name Jesus
[30:08] for he shall save his people from their
[30:11] sins
[30:13] now all this was done that it might be
[30:16] fulfilled
[30:18] what his dying giving his life
[30:21] making a way Etc what
[30:25] then it might be fulfilled which was
[30:26] spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying
[30:28] Behold a virgin she'll be with child and
[30:30] thou shalt bring forth a son and they
[30:32] shall call his name Emmanuel which is
[30:34] being interpreted is God With Us
[30:37] man God With Us
[30:40] not a second person
[30:42] you see me brother Dale you mean after
[30:44] 40 years you're still talking about
[30:46] whether how many persons they are yeah
[30:50] because I find among the ministers this
[30:52] message is the most confused
[30:56] doctrines of the godhead that us
[30:59] Baptists never went that far off
[31:02] and it can prove to you where your
[31:04] doctrines come from
[31:06] you say the River Jordan says that Jesus
[31:08] wouldn't God deliver Jordan that's
[31:10] exactly what there's an argument in
[31:11] Isaiah
[31:15] so you got the doctrine from there
[31:18] look at this first Timothy 3 16.
[31:22] and without controversy great is the
[31:25] mystery of godliness
[31:27] the second person of the trinity
[31:31] huh
[31:33] oh that's not what that says it says God
[31:36] was manifest in the flesh
[31:39] justified in the spirit scene of angels
[31:43] preached into the Gentiles
[31:47] I wish I could get to that and preach
[31:49] the service about it so how did he
[31:51] preach to the he never preached to the
[31:52] Gentiles
[31:55] nope he done that in the book of Acts
[31:58] okay believed on in the world received
[32:00] up into Glory
[32:02] what about it
[32:05] look at Colossians 2 8-9 there's a few
[32:09] scriptures
[32:13] be Wireless any man spoil you through
[32:16] philosophy and vain deceit
[32:19] after the tradition of men
[32:22] after the rudiments of the world and not
[32:25] after Christ
[32:27] right
[32:29] you remember over in Colossians I mean
[32:30] over in Corinthians were he said like
[32:33] Eve was deceived over the Simplicity of
[32:35] Christ
[32:37] verse 9 for in him dwell all the
[32:39] fullness of the godhead bodily
[32:41] all right
[32:43] one true and living God
[32:47] that we really believe that
[32:52] right and I gave them to you where
[32:53] brother Brandon says God keeps his word
[32:55] 1957 in body he was Man soul he was God
[33:00] Comforts with God 59 body he was a man
[33:04] in spirit he was God
[33:09] look at number 13.
[33:11] paragraph 226 of the revelation of Jesus
[33:14] Christ
[33:15] 1960.
[33:18] 1204 in the morning service
[33:20] and then have a beginning because he's
[33:22] talking about a son can't be no but it
[33:24] can't be no Eternal sonship right
[33:26] because there's no such a thing as an
[33:28] eternal son a son had a beginning so we
[33:31] can't be Eternal so the Flesh of Jesus
[33:34] as we would call him the son of God
[33:37] had a beginning
[33:40] it had a time it had to be made eternal
[33:42] that's right right
[33:44] come on sensible
[33:47] see
[33:48] there is no so-called there's no such
[33:50] thing as an eternal son at a beginning
[33:53] so he can't be Eternal you see he is the
[33:56] Eternal God
[33:58] not the Eternal Sun
[34:01] Glory the almighty Jehovah Jehovah Rapha
[34:05] made manifest in flesh in him dwelt the
[34:07] fullness of the godhead bodily
[34:11] see then believing in one true and
[34:13] living God what do we believe
[34:20] now
[34:22] so then who was that
[34:27] and how did he live
[34:30] in body he was a man
[34:34] that body had a beginning
[34:37] spirit and soul in that body was
[34:39] almighty God
[34:41] are
[34:43] he wasn't God
[34:46] but you don't understand the great
[34:47] mystery see don't you just see that
[34:49] mystery it is unfold that he was not
[34:51] then he was
[34:54] well I think about where it says over in
[34:56] Revelation he that was and is not and
[34:59] was and is not and was and is not wasn't
[35:01] it is not means
[35:04] popes
[35:06] was that the way your Prophet said
[35:09] so what are you calling him
[35:13] that's right brother said no man could
[35:15] die like that man died
[35:18] there was no human mortal could stand
[35:20] what that man stood that's right
[35:25] if he was a Son of God as a trinitarian
[35:28] concept then
[35:31] would you allow your son to be beat that
[35:34] much when all you had to do was just
[35:37] right that's right you didn't have to
[35:39] move
[35:40] right you didn't have to even speak
[35:43] you only had to think
[35:45] and would have ended all
[35:48] there he was
[35:51] sure as a mortal
[35:53] crying out
[35:55] my God my God why is Thou forsaken me
[36:00] sure he was a human mortal in body
[36:04] tempted as in all points as we are yet
[36:06] without sin
[36:11] but then one day that body was made
[36:13] eternal
[36:15] all right
[36:16] so we have an eternal atonement as we
[36:18] started off with Laura go see in body
[36:22] he was my brother
[36:25] huh
[36:27] Darcy kinsman redeemer had to come into
[36:29] being
[36:31] because your kinsman redeemer would
[36:33] would have to cover all things in
[36:35] Redemption
[36:37] so right around said all that Adam lost
[36:39] Jesus Christ restored
[36:41] all right amen now
[36:44] so then
[36:45] in body he was a man
[36:48] and security with almighty God because
[36:50] he said into thy hand I commend my
[36:52] spirit
[36:54] and in Soul he was the soul of God that
[36:57] your Prophet said he died and went to
[36:59] hell
[37:00] he said what went to hell he said he
[37:02] sold his Spirit his person of his being
[37:10] that's not Oneness
[37:14] see one that says that Jesus was the
[37:16] life's manifestation of God I don't
[37:18] agree with that because the Bride of
[37:20] Jesus Christ is the life's manifestation
[37:22] in the Gentile dispensation
[37:24] then once we leave here
[37:27] there will be more of God to be revealed
[37:29] and the Jews 144 000 will be that
[37:33] manifestation of God
[37:36] see so it's not running out
[37:39] it's coming to a place of understanding
[37:43] so he's not the Eternal son he's the
[37:47] Eternal God
[37:49] he said I don't believe in Eternal
[37:50] sonship but he said I believe in eternal
[37:52] godship
[37:55] you want that quote any computer eternal
[37:58] godship
[37:59] yeah
[38:01] if I can find it surely you can
[38:04] because I'm computer illiterate
[38:07] I still don't know how to figure that
[38:08] out
[38:09] Eternal God but not sonship
[38:12] you that are really up on it can do that
[38:14] without them cut it short and I have to
[38:15] run through the rest of it because if
[38:17] you know how to use the software you can
[38:19] cut your quotes down real quick
[38:21] but I just learned to do it the old way
[38:23] and I'm still there I was on dos until
[38:25] 10 years ago
[38:28] okay
[38:31] but now listen
[38:34] you and I are Body Spirit and soul
[38:38] right right now the Lord willing someone
[38:41] asked me to so we'll drop from that
[38:43] point because I don't want to go too far
[38:45] because I was asked here a while back to
[38:48] speak on the soul
[38:50] so I will try to
[38:52] bring that into the message and show the
[38:54] new birth
[38:55] the
[38:56] it doesn't bother me to preach it over
[38:57] again
[38:58] but listen
[39:00] he became my brother
[39:04] when he became man on Earth
[39:10] he became my Kinsmen Redeemer in the
[39:14] bases that he had to give that life
[39:18] so that life within him could be able to
[39:21] come back
[39:24] the Bible said the Holy Ghost has not
[39:25] been guilt because Jesus Christ has not
[39:27] been crucified or glorified every which
[39:29] way you want to put it
[39:33] see he had to die
[39:37] to release that life
[39:40] does everybody understand it
[39:42] he had to die to release the life that
[39:44] was in him
[39:46] without that life in him we do not have
[39:49] the new birth
[39:52] so the prophet said as we read that I
[39:53] want to go he sent back then there's
[39:55] another quote to go anywhere you want
[39:57] them then he sent back on the day of
[39:59] Pentecost his soul in the form of the
[40:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[40:03] and he said when that had all given out
[40:05] then it would be finished
[40:09] all right
[40:12] and see then church
[40:15] he paid the price
[40:18] amen
[40:20] he had to pay that price
[40:23] that I can live
[40:26] all right
[40:30] now
[40:31] if there's
[40:33] more than one God you can talk about all
[40:35] kind of things but if you're dealing
[40:37] with one God
[40:38] then you've got to be dealing with
[40:42] it was necessary that he died or release
[40:45] that life
[40:46] that was within him
[40:48] that shouldn't need a revelation that
[40:50] should be sensible
[40:53] you know even the Baptist would tell you
[40:55] Jesus had to die
[40:57] of course he don't understand it but he
[40:59] tell you how to die
[41:02] because there's no way it's like I told
[41:04] you the other day why couldn't he as
[41:07] standing there he was almighty God
[41:11] why couldn't he just turn around and
[41:12] speak and make our bodies
[41:16] eternal
[41:18] don't you believe he could speak the
[41:20] word
[41:21] he raised the dead man
[41:23] He restored a man that had been dead and
[41:25] rotten
[41:28] why couldn't he just speak the rest of
[41:29] it
[41:31] what you see
[41:32] that would have not given
[41:35] the thing that he come to do
[41:38] now
[41:40] Rita wants you to run into your com your
[41:42] Bible and study it about the only
[41:45] begotten
[41:48] you see
[41:51] the son of man
[41:55] was the only begotten
[42:02] come on
[42:03] you said but these prophets their son of
[42:05] man they're a son of man
[42:10] right do you need that
[42:14] Jesus Christ was the son of man
[42:18] that's why in his life he never declared
[42:20] as the prophet said himself to be the
[42:21] son of God
[42:24] because he wasn't fulfill in that office
[42:25] he'd done that on a day of Pentecost and
[42:27] been Son of God down through seven
[42:28] churches hey he said he was fulfilling
[42:31] the office of Son of Man
[42:34] we deal as son of man thinking about
[42:36] profit that's right that's good we we
[42:40] got that much
[42:41] but just remember the only way he could
[42:43] become kin folks to you and I was to be
[42:46] the son of man
[42:48] amen not meaning he come from man
[42:54] right
[42:57] Mary didn't have anything to do with it
[42:58] right come on not meaning did he come
[43:01] from man it means he come as a man
[43:06] right the son of man
[43:11] now watch him as he's on Earth
[43:14] he said to son of man hath power
[43:17] to what
[43:19] forgive sins
[43:23] who can forgive sins
[43:28] no one can forgive sins unless it's God
[43:30] right
[43:36] see there's no forgiveness outside of
[43:38] Jesus Christ
[43:41] what now he's the only begotten because
[43:43] he's the only son of man
[43:47] it's over about into the
[43:50] um somewhere in anointed ones are right
[43:52] about in there in my mind I'll catch it
[43:54] in a minute
[43:55] but he said get this straightened out
[43:59] he said it's the seventh Church age
[44:01] messenger
[44:02] he said it's not the son of man
[44:05] said the son of man is God himself
[44:09] well people say brother random will
[44:10] speak some of them no no he says that he
[44:13] was a son of man
[44:17] if he was decent of man that's Jesus
[44:19] Christ
[44:20] right amen come on you've gone into
[44:22] deity
[44:25] but the wrong way
[44:27] I truly believe in deity but I don't
[44:29] believe it like that
[44:31] that's what I told the man up in
[44:32] Jeffersonville one time he was standing
[44:33] there talking about brother Brown I'm
[44:34] being deity I said let me tell you
[44:36] something I said I believe that man
[44:38] there got the Holy Ghost if you'll say
[44:40] that man by the Holy Ghost Inside of him
[44:44] his deity take away the fact that
[44:46] brother Branham and all the gifts and
[44:48] all the signs and the Wonders and let
[44:50] brother random stand here I'll agree
[44:52] with you in deity because that man's
[44:53] deity as well as this man's deity oh no
[44:56] he said well you know who you're talking
[44:59] to
[45:03] but see the son of man
[45:07] is the Lord Jesus Christ
[45:11] he was the one that was in all of those
[45:14] prophets back there that spoke
[45:16] it wasn't Moses telling God a better way
[45:19] to do something come on
[45:21] who was it
[45:22] right running around and said it was
[45:24] Christ in Moses
[45:27] see Moses wasn't this on a man
[45:32] the son of man when you say the it means
[45:35] singular that's what I tried to tell him
[45:37] Baptist
[45:38] huh
[45:40] it said John the Baptist
[45:43] in the scripture
[45:46] right there at the lights I tried my
[45:48] best to show them I said if it says John
[45:50] be Baptist ain't never been but one
[45:53] and why you want to say you're a Baptist
[45:57] right
[46:00] because there was only one of them
[46:02] John the Baptist if it said John a
[46:05] Baptist
[46:06] then they could be more Baptist
[46:10] you see I didn't get along too good back
[46:11] there either you know so I've kind of
[46:14] been in that all my life I guess kind of
[46:16] a troublemaker but you know I still do
[46:18] the best I can
[46:19] and I love everybody I think I'll try to
[46:22] prove that
[46:23] you never respected I can do but do you
[46:27] understand what it means to be decent
[46:29] amount
[46:31] read just read the quotes read the
[46:34] scriptures
[46:35] well let's let's do that brother well I
[46:36] got him on the back
[46:38] especially the last one I told them I
[46:39] might not need these but hang on I might
[46:41] need them okay
[46:45] jump back over on the back of your notes
[46:47] for
[46:47] yeah brother
[46:49] and let's start off John 1 14.
[46:53] now who was John 1 14. in the beginning
[46:55] of his word word is with God the Word
[46:56] was God
[46:58] and the Word was made flesh who
[47:01] the son of man
[47:07] and dwell among us and we beheld his
[47:09] glory the glory as the only begotten of
[47:12] the father
[47:13] full of grace and truth
[47:15] the only one ever be gotten that away
[47:17] the only son of man
[47:20] the only Thief son of man
[47:23] John 1 18 goes up and it says no math
[47:26] has seen God at any time the only
[47:28] begotten which is in the bosom of the
[47:31] father
[47:32] he hath declared him brought him out
[47:36] into the open to you know open where he
[47:38] could be seen it declared him okay going
[47:41] to John 3 14.
[47:46] as Moses
[47:47] a serpent in the wilderness
[47:49] even so must the son of man
[47:52] be lifted up
[47:54] that whosoever believeth in him should
[47:56] not perish but have eternal life for God
[47:59] so loved the world that he gave his only
[48:00] begotten son
[48:02] uh verse 14 he said it was the son of
[48:04] man
[48:06] that he gave his only begotten son that
[48:08] whosoever believes in Him should not
[48:09] perish but have everlasting life for God
[48:11] sent not his son into the world to
[48:13] condemn the world but that the world
[48:14] through him might be saved he that
[48:16] believeth on him is not condemned but he
[48:18] that believeth not is condemned already
[48:21] because he hath not believed in the name
[48:23] of the only begotten son of God
[48:26] come on are we in the scripture go to
[48:29] the next one
[48:32] uh
[48:34] yeah
[48:36] first John 5 1 whosoever believeth that
[48:38] Jesus is the Christ is born of God
[48:41] and everyone that loveth him that begat
[48:46] loveth him also that is begotten of him
[48:52] so if you love the one who begat that's
[48:54] God
[48:55] you're going to have to love the one
[48:57] that is begotten of him which would be
[49:00] God in human flesh
[49:02] I thought we believed it Lula at least
[49:06] that the Bride of Jesus Christ according
[49:08] to Revelations 1 about 13 or 14 says
[49:13] he's standing in the midst of the seven
[49:14] golden candlesticks one like unto the
[49:17] son of man gird about the pouts with a
[49:19] golden girdle the feminist picture of
[49:22] the bride of Christ
[49:25] right that's what God thinks of us
[49:28] first John 5 18 we know that whosoever
[49:31] is born of God sent us not but he that
[49:33] is begotten of God keepeth himself
[49:37] in that one Wicked one toucheth him not
[49:42] he could never touch him
[49:44] because he was begotten of God
[49:47] now if you and I can be begotten of him
[49:52] right I thought that's what we believe
[49:54] the new birth was
[49:57] I thought that was what we thought it
[49:59] was
[50:02] that he is begotten of God keepeth
[50:05] himself
[50:06] he kept himself
[50:09] he was the only begotten we're begotten
[50:11] through him
[50:13] right
[50:14] because he had to come and pay the price
[50:19] the only way the life could come
[50:22] back up on anybody
[50:24] you only had the anointing in the Old
[50:26] Testament
[50:28] right
[50:29] the anointing was there
[50:31] the anointing of the Old Testament never
[50:34] made them Sons and Daughters of God
[50:36] right
[50:37] I want the scripture for it I want the
[50:39] profit forward I want to see it where
[50:41] it's at
[50:42] I think
[50:43] because Jesus Christ had not died the
[50:46] scripture says
[50:48] on until he died there was no one able
[50:50] to come into the kingdom of God
[50:57] because that kingdom was within him the
[50:59] scripture says
[51:00] right
[51:02] come on have you read your Scriptures it
[51:04] says it was in him the kingdom was
[51:05] within him
[51:07] they wandered seed organization arguing
[51:10] even this message arguing well was it in
[51:12] him or was it out here or was it in them
[51:15] people
[51:16] the Bible said it was in him
[51:18] I ain't got no argument
[51:21] the Bible said in him dwelt the fullness
[51:23] of the godhead modeling got no argument
[51:25] the Bible said in him was Emmanuel God
[51:28] With Us
[51:30] got no problem
[51:33] he was declared to be the son of man
[51:37] with power and honor and Glory
[51:40] amen
[51:42] he could forgive sins he could raise the
[51:45] Dead
[51:46] right
[51:48] yep
[51:49] see
[51:53] what a wonderful thing to think about
[51:55] what you and I have been told
[51:58] a Christmas message yes
[52:01] what have we have been told
[52:04] the truth of the word of God or did we
[52:06] don't have to
[52:08] bow down to anybody what I think
[52:16] you know everybody's got a way of
[52:18] justifying everything into you
[52:22] you know what when I'm talking to you I
[52:24] expect
[52:26] can I stop a pause a minute and look at
[52:28] the internet you know and say you're
[52:30] getting what I mean I expect I expect
[52:33] you to not understand what I'm saying
[52:38] yep
[52:41] brother Dale
[52:44] yeah cause you're human
[52:46] and if you said it to me I wouldn't
[52:48] understand you
[52:51] I might sympathize with it to say
[52:53] there's no better way of saying it
[52:56] but unless it's revealed
[53:00] you don't know what I'm talking about
[53:05] right
[53:07] unless it's revealed
[53:10] I told you I was a good old-fashioned
[53:14] maybe Oneness when I was in the Baptist
[53:15] Church and I believe that Jesus was so
[53:18] much almighty God that he couldn't stump
[53:19] his toe
[53:22] that's what I believed
[53:26] but I couldn't explain it that's why
[53:27] when brother Modi said what do you
[53:29] believe about God I said we Baptist
[53:31] believe in one true and living God he
[53:33] said right he knew the Baptist Doctrine
[53:35] and that is the Baptist Doctrine
[53:37] he said can you explain I said yeah God
[53:39] three persons
[53:44] now you're a sensible man
[53:48] and said a person's a personality
[53:51] personality is an individual individuals
[53:53] person
[53:54] he said your Trinity is like everybody
[53:55] else
[53:56] you know what
[53:57] that wasn't revealed to me
[54:02] it was just plain sense there was no
[54:05] other way of saying it
[54:08] you listen to brother Branham
[54:12] listen to right around and we've talked
[54:13] about the other night my wife said
[54:14] listen to him explaining simple things
[54:21] the theologians sitting there at that
[54:24] great Trinity that nobody can't explain
[54:27] the prophet gets up and he said
[54:30] you're a father you're a human and
[54:31] you're a son
[54:33] I don't make you three
[54:37] and then with theologians if
[54:41] we can't argue with him but we don't
[54:43] believe it
[54:45] right
[54:47] they went back home believing the same
[54:49] thing like that 300 preachers that run
[54:52] around and explain water baptism in the
[54:53] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and they
[54:55] got up and said we want the tapes
[54:58] we're going to take us to our church not
[55:00] a one of them he said
[55:03] ever
[55:04] was baptized in the name of the Lord
[55:06] Jesus Christ
[55:09] see once they walked away from him
[55:12] That Old Devil come back and you're
[55:14] going to lose your church
[55:17] you're gonna lose your money you don't
[55:19] have to go to work for a living
[55:21] yeah
[55:23] right
[55:26] come on folks
[55:28] I think it's time to get in or get out
[55:33] that's what I told a man at my house
[55:34] years ago
[55:36] he was sitting there talking about
[55:37] something and I said listen brother why
[55:40] don't you get in or get out
[55:45] they believed that brother random just
[55:46] come and laid a foundation he's
[55:47] explaining it to me wrote around this
[55:49] laid a foundation we're supposed to be
[55:52] where the word comes to now
[55:54] I said well tell me what the seventh
[55:56] seal is in
[55:58] boy he shut up he said you're the
[56:01] teacher you tell me I said that don't
[56:03] work with me I asked the question to you
[56:08] I said why don't you get in the message
[56:09] or get out
[56:11] the man's own wife Stood Beside of him
[56:14] and said brother Dale you're exactly
[56:17] right and until this day I don't know of
[56:19] her ever believing truly the message
[56:24] right you certainly don't believe in him
[56:29] but you see church we claim to believe
[56:30] this we claim to believe that
[56:34] but can we put our life on it because
[56:36] we're going to have to pretty quick
[56:37] whether you believe it or not you're
[56:39] going to be put on the line pretty quick
[56:41] and what I'm watching now is people just
[56:43] dying and falling away
[56:46] yeah just slowly falling away
[56:50] from that surge that violence within
[56:54] them when they first heard of the
[56:55] message
[56:57] and the desire to know about God and now
[57:01] they're just
[57:02] Falling Away
[57:04] you're talking about so and so
[57:08] yeah
[57:09] yeah
[57:10] any problem
[57:12] talking about you
[57:14] any problem
[57:17] they say don't play with me on words
[57:19] like I told Wade the other day
[57:22] and I mean it you come in my office and
[57:24] you talk to me I'll listen to anything
[57:26] you got to say
[57:28] but when I call you in my office you
[57:30] ain't gonna talk
[57:32] I'm gonna do the talking
[57:34] when I call you in there I'll talk to
[57:36] you
[57:38] you won't pity pattern baby around with
[57:41] me
[57:41] I'll Stand and look in your face and
[57:43] tell you I don't believe it
[57:45] I've had to do it and I keep on doing it
[57:48] why because I got to be one thing
[57:51] I've got to be to the bases that I've
[57:52] got something I can depend on
[57:55] and that's this message
[57:59] my whole life is in this message it's
[58:01] got something else
[58:03] I don't have no Swift bank account just
[58:07] in case this thing don't work
[58:09] and I don't have no denominational
[58:11] friends just in case it don't work and I
[58:13] can go back
[58:21] if I stand alone I'll stand it by myself
[58:24] why because I believe in one true and
[58:26] living God and I believe he is a great
[58:28] God of I am
[58:31] brother Dale we're not all like that's
[58:33] right there's some people that are
[58:35] disturbing enough to believe
[58:39] you see that's what I believe in
[58:41] and when I hear Brothers say something
[58:44] I'm not satisfied this is a quotient no
[58:47] no that's right I'm going to quote this
[58:49] and then I'll take it up Wednesday
[58:50] because I know I can't get through if I
[58:51] do I'm gonna be late
[58:55] you know that in all of your world
[58:57] believes and
[58:59] there were things that Jesus died to
[59:00] give you an inheritance
[59:06] well that's what it sounds like he's
[59:08] talking about a while ago
[59:10] brother Reynolds said he never died to
[59:12] give you an inheritance
[59:15] he said he died
[59:17] to bring you back to that it hurt
[59:23] we'll take that up Wednesday
[59:27] but think about it now
[59:32] maybe you ought to think this way
[59:36] there's many ways to make an inheritance
[59:42] I can give the kids money
[59:45] you know
[59:47] and I tell them that's part of your
[59:50] inheritance
[59:54] they'll also tell them
[59:56] and I want to buy me a
[59:59] Bad Boy Buggy that's part of your
[1:00:01] inheritance
[1:00:03] that you ain't gonna get
[1:00:09] you got to have a will
[1:00:11] to make it out
[1:00:14] you're going to have a will
[1:00:16] think on these things just think about
[1:00:18] it and then we'll just quit
[1:00:22] see I believe in one true and living God
[1:00:25] in Jesus is his name
[1:00:28] I believe that was almighty God walking
[1:00:31] on this Earth
[1:00:32] just as the Bible says
[1:00:36] you said what he prayed to the father
[1:00:40] uh
[1:00:41] do you pray
[1:00:46] do you pray
[1:00:47] who you pray to
[1:00:51] be careful yeah right it looks like
[1:00:54] you're praying to yourself
[1:00:59] I told you if I ever get enough to where
[1:01:00] I can get enough you think I'm all of
[1:01:03] this out of the other but
[1:01:04] I want to go back to Genesis and bring
[1:01:06] the godhead out of there again one of
[1:01:07] these days and speak on some things
[1:01:10] he had to come to where he came
[1:01:13] to fulfill the scriptures
[1:01:16] but that was almighty God
[1:01:19] coming down
[1:01:20] to reveal himself to you and I
[1:01:26] and his death won't do you a bit of good
[1:01:28] until it's revealed
[1:01:31] his death never saved nobody
[1:01:35] are you listening
[1:01:38] show me one person his death saved well
[1:01:41] that's me no no I'm sorry you believed
[1:01:44] it
[1:01:45] you had to accept it
[1:01:48] because he won't override your Fremont
[1:01:49] agency and make you be saved
[1:01:53] so you had to accept it
[1:01:56] yes but brother Dale you don't
[1:01:57] understand that big seed that I've had
[1:02:01] all I want to know what is the seed of
[1:02:03] God
[1:02:06] that's all I want to know
[1:02:09] that's all I've ever had
[1:02:14] riding up the road one day with a
[1:02:16] brother in the car and he was explaining
[1:02:18] all about this seed being I said Okay I
[1:02:20] want to ask you one question simple
[1:02:21] question
[1:02:25] is that seed in your body your spirit or
[1:02:27] your soul
[1:02:29] where's it at
[1:02:35] he said the sensible answer
[1:02:39] did anybody ought to say
[1:02:42] you know what he said
[1:02:45] I ain't gonna say
[1:02:51] I said because you ain't gonna say cause
[1:02:53] you don't know
[1:02:56] he said I'm just not going to comment
[1:03:00] that's a good answer
[1:03:02] at least he had no sense to say that
[1:03:05] but listen Church
[1:03:07] one true and living God
[1:03:13] what do we think about that
[1:03:18] and to think that he hung on that cross
[1:03:23] and he simply just stepped out of that
[1:03:24] body
[1:03:27] the Bible says the spirit went to God
[1:03:29] who gave it
[1:03:31] the Bible says the prophet says what his
[1:03:33] soul went to hell
[1:03:35] to preached
[1:03:36] to the souls in prison
[1:03:40] said his soul and let's see him if I get
[1:03:43] it wrong now you put it he said his
[1:03:45] Spirit was released and come to his soul
[1:03:46] and his soul back to his body and he
[1:03:48] raised up
[1:03:49] who's standing there
[1:03:53] but you see that live exited out of that
[1:03:56] body and that body died
[1:04:00] but it didn't rotten but it died
[1:04:05] a person with a baptism when the Holy
[1:04:07] Ghost dies the body rots
[1:04:10] but the soul lives on even a sinner the
[1:04:13] soul lives on somewhere until the day of
[1:04:15] judgment
[1:04:20] but what are we doing
[1:04:25] you see that's the Christ that's the God
[1:04:27] that I talk about that's the one that I
[1:04:28] know and for surety that he's God
[1:04:34] not a second person
[1:04:36] now let me just finish it by this
[1:04:40] if you have the baptism of the Holy
[1:04:43] Ghost
[1:04:44] which is the life of God you agree
[1:04:48] you agree the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:50] is the life of God living in you then
[1:04:52] you're not a second person
[1:04:56] no no you're going too far no I ain't
[1:05:00] went far enough
[1:05:01] sorry he went far enough at least you
[1:05:04] know what I believe
[1:05:06] nobody can't say that don't know why
[1:05:08] brother
[1:05:10] that's what he believes
[1:05:13] right
[1:05:15] but you see you ain't a second person
[1:05:18] your God manifested in flesh in the
[1:05:21] portion that you are
[1:05:23] he was God in the fullness
[1:05:28] but we're Sons and Daughters of God
[1:05:32] by the new birth
[1:05:34] and we're just a portion of God it takes
[1:05:37] all of us together
[1:05:38] we were talking about last night about
[1:05:40] the bride age everybody wants to preach
[1:05:42] about the bright age there was a bright
[1:05:44] age in every Church age
[1:05:50] if you listen to that
[1:05:51] you see every Church ain't had a bright
[1:05:53] age you know why go to never age the
[1:05:55] bride was called out of the age show me
[1:05:57] anywhere the prophet ever put the bride
[1:06:00] in an age
[1:06:03] come on I'm open
[1:06:08] here we are in Lady of Sia
[1:06:11] right
[1:06:13] who were called out
[1:06:16] run around and said to Pentecostal age
[1:06:19] is over
[1:06:22] but he never said the lady you'll see an
[1:06:24] age is over
[1:06:26] the lady you'll see an age goes right on
[1:06:28] over ties into the Millennium and
[1:06:31] there's even time in the Millennium 1000
[1:06:34] years
[1:06:36] but he said Pentecost
[1:06:40] is done denominated and died
[1:06:43] now not the Holy Ghost Pentecost
[1:06:47] can't do that
[1:06:50] but the people who said cabbage down
[1:06:55] he said if I come
[1:06:57] let's see now make sure I get it right
[1:06:58] it's on the Feast of the trumpets
[1:07:01] you got it let me read it then
[1:07:03] where I want to make sure and miss it
[1:07:05] because if I misquote it then somebody
[1:07:06] said he didn't grow it around okay
[1:07:10] this is paragraph 64 Feast of the
[1:07:13] trumpets
[1:07:15] now if I come with a message of
[1:07:17] Pentecost
[1:07:21] I would be in
[1:07:22] the lady you'll see in the church age
[1:07:28] and it wouldn't be right
[1:07:35] it wouldn't be right he said
[1:07:38] because he wasn't the messenger to
[1:07:40] Pentecost
[1:07:45] did you see a book and you get home read
[1:07:47] page 464.
[1:07:49] you got the new one I'll probably find
[1:07:51] that in for you somewhere
[1:07:53] but just remember the prophet said
[1:07:56] no Messenger to the age because the Holy
[1:07:58] Ghost came himself
[1:08:00] in the fullness of the baptism
[1:08:03] when he said as it ended up on every age
[1:08:05] then the messenger came
[1:08:09] I've heard people in advance stood right
[1:08:11] here one time and preached
[1:08:13] and said Luther was false Wesley was
[1:08:17] false and Pentecost was false
[1:08:20] I had already showed him where brother
[1:08:22] random said that
[1:08:25] before we came here but that didn't do a
[1:08:27] bit of good to reading what brother
[1:08:28] random said
[1:08:30] he just had his own way of saying it and
[1:08:33] he said it
[1:08:38] the Holy Ghost came himself on the death
[1:08:40] Pentecost of Zeus's Street
[1:08:43] that's what your Prophet said
[1:08:45] he said a prophetic Prophet come down
[1:08:51] a prophetic well that's right around no
[1:08:54] sorry keep on reading
[1:08:59] the holy ghost that fell on Azusa Street
[1:09:02] was the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:07] the prophet came on Azusa Street
[1:09:12] then when brother random come along
[1:09:15] you just stepped right on over into him
[1:09:18] to finish the age
[1:09:22] you see that away Church we've got a
[1:09:23] wonderful beautiful message
[1:09:25] to believe
[1:09:29] to believe in an eternal God
[1:09:34] one that can keep his word
[1:09:39] think on these things
[1:09:42] because that's
[1:09:44] my way of saying
[1:09:47] of what I believe
[1:09:50] well you're just too stubborn there's no
[1:09:52] good to come and talk to you
[1:09:57] I'm glad you think that
[1:10:00] you know what
[1:10:02] because I am stubborn
[1:10:05] don't come to me with ceceified petty
[1:10:08] little doctrines and expect me to
[1:10:11] swallow it because brother so and so
[1:10:13] said it
[1:10:17] I don't care what brother so-and-so said
[1:10:21] I believe what wrote around him said
[1:10:25] bring me any quote in contrary
[1:10:29] from the prophet of what I've taught
[1:10:32] and I want to see it
[1:10:36] is that being sarcastic arrogant hateful
[1:10:38] hey I'm all of them
[1:10:44] because this church wasn't built folks
[1:10:48] on the basis of trying to be some
[1:10:49] pettified ceceified little doctrinal
[1:10:51] idea
[1:10:53] the first message I preached in this
[1:10:55] building wait a minute
[1:10:57] might have been at my house
[1:10:59] first message I preached comparing us as
[1:11:02] a church was going Beyond man's camp
[1:11:06] that's the title of it
[1:11:08] you remember right around and said going
[1:11:10] Beyond man's Camp remember the message
[1:11:13] I took the thought and I said then I
[1:11:15] said you people will ever hear this
[1:11:17] message
[1:11:18] don't fall out of that with us about
[1:11:20] what we're doing
[1:11:22] you can camp do what you want to
[1:11:26] but we're going Beyond man's camp
[1:11:28] we're going to walk in God's word
[1:11:33] and that way then you can't put me in
[1:11:35] these camps
[1:11:37] brother now you're in one of them two
[1:11:39] Souls seventh anniversary
[1:11:41] you may say he's an old stubborn goats
[1:11:44] in his own camp
[1:11:47] that's all right with me
[1:11:51] it's all right
[1:11:53] as long as I'm in the right camp
[1:11:56] don't worry about it
[1:11:58] you understand
[1:12:00] but now listen we said we're going to
[1:12:01] change the way we were doing things
[1:12:04] and we're gonna
[1:12:06] have a part now so the brothers are
