[29:43] turn back where we read this morning
[29:45] from
[29:46] romans and then we'll read from genesis
[29:49] 3
[29:50] and try to get right on into the message
[29:53] um
[29:55] there's been kind of a
[29:58] straightening up or whatever you want to
[29:59] call it of what
[30:01] it is about the baby shower so everybody

[30:04] that was given this morning and
[30:06] and then the things has been added to it
[30:09] but
[30:10] there will be a baby shower on the 24th
[30:13] of november
[30:14] on the sunday afternoon after the
[30:17] the evening service
[30:19] all right now sister anna is registered

[30:57] so we make sure and get that announced
[30:59] where that will we'll get it in the
[31:01] right order so
[31:03] it'll do it amen
[31:04] i hope you enjoyed this morning
[31:06] i got pretty hard and stern and stiff
[31:09] but
[31:10] uh i was thinking about it sitting in
[31:12] there and i thought well you know maybe
[31:13] i shouldn't use such a hard word as i
[31:16] use to try to get you to think about it
[31:18] but
[31:19] you know we say things and you say well
[31:21] you shouldn't say a lot of things in
[31:23] front of the kids then you send your
[31:24] kids to sex education at school
[31:27] and they're going to learn a whole lot
[31:28] more than what i've said
[31:30] in a whole lot of different words
[31:33] and a whole lot of different
[31:34] illustrations that's right
[31:36] it's going to be given to them but yet
[31:38] you don't get upset at them but you know
[31:40] you think well i i do the best i can but
[31:42] i'm just human and i know that i a lot
[31:45] of times i uh
[31:47] say things harsh
[31:49] but there's one thing about it
[31:52] it's come from a heart of love
[31:54] you know i love you and i hope you love
[31:56] me
[31:57] know that i don't like to be a lot of
[31:59] times what i am
[32:01] sometimes i have to come out and rebuke
[32:03] and do things you know and i don't like
[32:05] that but
[32:07] i try to do it for the honor and glory
[32:08] of the lord
[32:10] so as long as you love me you'll look
[32:12] over my faults and failures all right if
[32:15] you don't look over my faults and
[32:16] failures you don't love me
[32:18] okay
[32:20] that's a pretty good weapon
[32:22] i'm glad i thought of that
[32:24] but we just
[32:25] we'll try to take up the message and
[32:27] carry on i was aiming at this try to
[32:29] finish a whole lot into that message but
[32:31] we'll try to put it together with the
[32:33] afternoon message
[32:34] and uh
[32:35] you know carry this thought on of what
[32:37] we're trying to do is cover some things
[32:39] in the scriptures
[32:41] about what happened in the garden and
[32:43] the things like that and just taking the
[32:45] verses and a comment from brother
[32:47] branham about it and trying to look into
[32:50] this but now remember we're still
[32:51] talking about
[32:54] predestination we're still talking about
[32:58] predestination looking back to
[33:00] foreknowledge for knowledge being first
[33:03] all right then predestination well you
[33:06] couldn't begin predestination until we
[33:08] started the early journey
[33:10] well then you can see that god knew what
[33:12] was going to happen in the garden that's
[33:14] what i'm trying to cover
[33:16] to get you to look at is what happened
[33:18] in the garden
[33:19] is it's god fulfilling his
[33:22] predestinated plan
[33:25] he said well that means god planned it
[33:27] no god knew
[33:29] before knowledge
[33:31] all right
[33:32] so he knew what would take place it's
[33:33] not pulling anything over on him but
[33:36] he's there to make sure that everything
[33:37] works good all right but let's pray
[33:40] father we thank you
[33:41] we love you and we ask you now to just
[33:43] be with us lord
[33:44] and forgive us sometimes when do we
[33:46] speak harsh and
[33:47] firm and say words maybe we shouldn't
[33:49] say
[33:51] as a preacher to use the word stupid or
[33:53] crazy or something but lord i'm just
[33:55] trying now to do the best i can
[33:58] and and you just put that to my
[34:00] ignorance of not knowing any better
[34:03] but yet the people can go and look at it
[34:06] and they they can make a lot of fun and
[34:08] light about the way that i say things
[34:10] but lord
[34:12] all i want to know is it the truth
[34:14] if it's not the truth i want to know
[34:17] because my whole soul life and
[34:18] everything is built up on one thing
[34:21] and that is that you brought us a
[34:23] message
[34:24] it's up to us to believe it and not to
[34:26] just believe it but to bring it into
[34:28] manifestation
[34:30] so lord we just ask you to help us and
[34:32] guide us now and keep us and father just
[34:35] let your light shine in each one of our
[34:36] hearts and lives
[34:38] those that are not here maybe when they
[34:39] hear it on tape they can finish out the
[34:41] parts of the message lord
[34:43] and you know the reasons why that
[34:45] sometimes we're not here so that's into
[34:48] your hands
[34:49] we love you and we thank you
[34:51] god each one of us now in jesus name
[34:54] amen
[34:56] romans
[34:57] 8.
[35:00] now forgive us if we get a little up and
[35:03] down this afternoon and juggling
[35:04] messages because
[35:06] you know we've we've got
[35:08] uh quite a bit to go
[35:10] and uh try not to say too much
[35:13] to line back up but just enough for us
[35:15] to carry on the thought
[35:17] all right
[35:18] romans 8 28 for we know that all things
[35:20] work together for good to them that love
[35:23] god to them who are the called according
[35:24] to his purpose
[35:26] for whom he did no for no he also did
[35:28] predestinate to be conformed to the
[35:31] image of his son
[35:32] that he might be the firstborn among
[35:34] many brethren
[35:35] more to whom he did predestinate than he
[35:37] also called and whom he called them he
[35:39] also justified
[35:41] and whom he justified them he also
[35:43] glorified
[35:44] what shall they we then say to these
[35:46] things if god be for us
[35:49] who can be against us when we go back to
[35:51] genesis
[35:52] and we'll begin in the third chapter
[35:56] i think we went up to the 13th verse
[35:59] all right
[36:01] and we got down
[36:03] coming in part of that and we
[36:05] now we want to cover just a little bit
[36:08] and the lord god said unto the woman
[36:10] what is this that thou has done and the
[36:12] woman said the serpent beguiled me and i
[36:14] did eat
[36:15] the lord god said unto the serpent
[36:16] because thou hast done this thou art
[36:18] cursed above all cattle and above every
[36:21] beast to the field upon thy belly shalt
[36:23] thou go and thus shalt thou eat all the
[36:24] days of thy life
[36:26] and i will put enmity between thee and
[36:28] the woman between thy seed and her seed
[36:31] and it shall bruise thy head and thy
[36:33] shall bruise his heel
[36:35] unto the woman he said i will greatly
[36:36] multiply thy sorrow
[36:38] and thy conception as we were talking
[36:40] about this morning now why would it be
[36:42] going to the sorrow and the conception
[36:45] if it's just a unbelief of a former
[36:48] eating an apple as an attribute
[36:50] i mean why would these things be here
[36:53] unto the woman why would it not say unto
[36:54] the woman i'll greatly multiply thy
[36:57] bowel movement
[37:00] that's what you'd have to say it was an
[37:02] apple
[37:04] all right
[37:07] but no see
[37:10] i will greatly multiply thy sorrow in
[37:11] thy conception
[37:13] in sorrow thou shalt bring forth
[37:15] children and thy desire shall be to thy
[37:17] husband and he shall rule over thee
[37:20] and unto adam he said
[37:22] because dies hearken unto the voice of
[37:24] thy wife and has eaten of the tree of
[37:26] which i commanded thee saying thy shalt
[37:29] not eat of it cursed is the ground for
[37:31] thy sake and sorrow shall thou eat of it
[37:34] all the days without life thorns also
[37:37] and thistles shall it bring forth unto
[37:39] thee and thy shall eat the herb
[37:42] of the field
[37:43] and the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat
[37:45] bread till thou return unto the ground
[37:48] for out of it was thou taken for dust
[37:50] thou art and it does shalt thou return
[37:54] and adam called his wife's name eve now
[37:57] that was the first time
[37:58] in the bible she received a name
[38:01] now look at the definition
[38:04] because she was the mother
[38:07] of all living
[38:09] all right now there's not anything else
[38:11] to be involved see
[38:13] unto adam also and to his wife
[38:16] did the lord god makes coats of skin and
[38:19] clothed them
[38:21] and the lord god said behold a woman has
[38:23] now become excuse me behold a man has
[38:25] now become as one of us to know good and
[38:27] evil
[38:28] and now lest he put forth his hand and
[38:30] take also over the tree of life
[38:32] and eat and live forever therefore the
[38:35] lord god sent him forth from the garden
[38:36] of eden to till the ground for which he
[38:38] was taken
[38:39] so he drove drove out the man and he
[38:42] placed at the east of the garden of eden
[38:44] cerebellums and a flaming sword which
[38:47] turned every way to keep the way
[38:49] of the tree of life you may be seated to
[38:52] lord add his blessing
[38:54] to the reading of the word
[38:57] now we covered
[39:01] this morning got down to the part of
[39:03] talking about where
[39:05] that
[39:08] eve said the serpent beguiled me
[39:12] and i said we'd run back over this
[39:14] a little bit this afternoon
[39:16] you know and then carry our thought on
[39:19] so now the word beguiled
[39:22] it means to
[39:24] beguile it means to to deceive
[39:27] to be beguiled
[39:30] you remember i said this morning that
[39:32] uh it's translated
[39:34] there into it's only used
[39:36] uh 12 times in the
[39:39] uh no it's only used four times and it's
[39:41] used 12 times translated as the word
[39:43] deceived
[39:45] so deceived and beguiled would be the
[39:47] same word
[39:49] see that you're coming forth
[39:51] and we gave the scriptures and all and
[39:53] then we went on through beguile like it
[39:55] said to eve in second corinthians 11 3
[39:59] that lest satan
[40:01] you know
[40:02] by any means
[40:04] beguiled eve
[40:06] because you and i
[40:08] deceive us be god
[40:11] because deceived means to beguile
[40:14] or to deceived
[40:16] all right being used and beguiled
[40:19] we
[40:21] beguiled means to deceive deceived means
[40:23] to beguile
[40:25] all right then
[40:27] what are we coming to
[40:30] we're coming to the point that i asked
[40:32] this morning
[40:33] why would the prophet
[40:35] and we'll read it in a minute why would
[40:38] he use the word
[40:41] defiled
[40:43] when when
[40:44] beguiled means to deceive and deceive
[40:46] means to beguile
[40:48] why would he use the word defiled
[40:51] we'll read that in a moment but why
[40:53] would he do it like that
[40:55] and he says the word begal means to
[40:58] you know
[41:00] to defile
[41:02] all right
[41:03] now if the word
[41:05] means to defile by the definition of the
[41:07] prophet
[41:08] he's given us the scriptural definition
[41:12] which is greater than to just say
[41:14] beguile means to deceive
[41:16] he's going into the deeper points of
[41:18] understanding he knows what he's talking
[41:21] about right
[41:23] so we believe that
[41:26] but then the eve said the serpent
[41:28] beguiled me
[41:30] all right you remember right at the end
[41:32] we were trying to bring down the point
[41:36] that
[41:37] it says the serpent beguiled
[41:40] well that was the
[41:42] part of eve that was being beguiled was
[41:47] part her
[41:47] you called it
[41:49] of through the the mind of satan you
[41:52] know coming through the beast to be
[41:53] using it because there's a difference
[41:55] between the serpent and the beast
[41:58] so the serpent beguiled her
[42:01] the devil beguiled eve
[42:04] all right but he could not have any
[42:06] natural children he has no seed
[42:08] he could not have any intercourse etc
[42:12] with eve
[42:13] he knew he couldn't do
[42:14] that so what did he do he used the beast
[42:20] all right
[42:21] using the beast to
[42:23] talk to
[42:25] he was able to beguile eve
[42:29] all right getting her to think the wrong
[42:30] things
[42:32] then
[42:34] the prophet says the word
[42:37] because means to defile
[42:39] okay
[42:40] let's see if i can grab that in a hurry
[42:45] uh
[42:49] go over to number
[42:55] go to number 10
[42:56] brother what i said we're gonna have to
[42:58] jump back and forth this afternoon
[43:01] let's look at it and we'll see why the
[43:03] prophet said
[43:05] that the word
[43:07] beguile means to defile
[43:09] uh the word
[43:10] defile it means to be unclean
[43:15] become unclean become impure
[43:18] to be become unclean
[43:20] sexually religiously ceremonially
[43:25] something
[43:27] more than just the deceiving of the mind
[43:31] that said this morning then we talk
[43:33] about
[43:34] the sin in the garden as being unbelief
[43:36] well amen we believe that
[43:38] but what was the attribute
[43:40] or the physical happening
[43:43] that took place
[43:46] so you say well why do we need to know
[43:48] that it's this well why do we need to
[43:50] know that jesus had to come through a
[43:52] wound
[43:57] he had to be a kinsman redeemer didn't
[43:58] he
[44:00] all right
[44:01] but see think about it then
[44:03] it means to defile oneself
[44:06] means to be defiled sexually
[44:09] by idolatry
[44:12] it means to be recalled regarded as
[44:14] unclean
[44:15] see it's a a word
[44:18] the word beguile
[44:20] can cover the
[44:21] the
[44:23] reasoning factors
[44:26] you know
[44:27] the part of us we call the the second
[44:29] realm
[44:31] whether you want to call it soul or call
[44:32] it spirit
[44:34] it is the second realm that has the
[44:35] memory reason constant effect that's
[44:37] what satan done the serpent
[44:41] he came through that
[44:44] all right
[44:45] but then the beast
[44:50] came into being of what took place
[44:54] and he defiled eve
[44:57] he defiled the body i hope we have time
[44:59] to get to it he realized that what he
[45:01] really caused was death
[45:05] and we can tie it all back together
[45:08] listening last night
[45:09] to brother branham talking about it
[45:13] and if you talk about
[45:17] unbelief
[45:20] he said
[45:22] death always
[45:23] follows unbelief
[45:27] all right
[45:29] now we probably might not get that far
[45:30] but we'll try to to do something
[45:33] uh
[45:34] aaron would you come up and click cause
[45:35] we need at least a little air
[45:38] all right but you see what i'm talking
[45:40] about so what we were talking about this
[45:41] morning
[45:43] ending it up talking about the beast
[45:47] was used to defile
[45:52] the serpent
[45:55] the talking the
[45:57] the
[45:58] doings
[46:01] beguiled her
[46:03] so her whole being
[46:06] was defiled
[46:08] right
[46:09] brother said
[46:11] you know
[46:12] beguile means to defile
[46:15] all right he's right because what
[46:17] happened there was the serpent
[46:20] is satan
[46:22] he has no way to do anything wrong that
[46:25] way
[46:26] physically
[46:28] so he beguiled her mind
[46:31] and got her to thinking wrong
[46:34] then
[46:35] the beast was able to
[46:38] be used
[46:41] to defile her
[46:44] and then it odd these old bodies then
[46:46] like i said if it was apple one of the
[46:48] bodies condemned
[46:52] wasn't always something defile in the
[46:54] body one one and always
[46:57] well because that's what went wrong
[47:00] it brought death into the human race
[47:04] so we already know there's something
[47:05] wrong with that right
[47:08] but did you follow what it's talking
[47:09] about if he did we can jump over
[47:13] now think about it
[47:16] we've read this one before so we won't
[47:18] have to use it
[47:20] but brother branham said it in the
[47:22] future home
[47:26] he said god never cursed adam
[47:29] said he never cursed eve
[47:32] he cursed the beast we read that in the
[47:34] scripture
[47:38] he cursed the devil the serpent we can
[47:40] read that connecting two scriptures
[47:42] there
[47:44] we said he never cursed eve
[47:48] now i told you that i'd like to preach
[47:50] about an hour and a half or two hours on
[47:52] why it says the lord god spoke that we
[47:55] just read a moment ago
[47:57] jehovah elohim
[47:59] which means like a father with his
[48:01] family
[48:02] the eternal god created mankind
[48:05] and was come had come down to worship
[48:08] you know to be worshiped the fellowship
[48:10] with mankind
[48:12] all right
[48:14] in being the fellowship with mankind
[48:18] then he would be kept as lord god
[48:20] and he didn't throw us away
[48:24] so he didn't curse adam
[48:29] he never cursed eve
[48:32] remember to put this cough drop in
[48:33] because
[48:34] i hollered too much this morning
[48:37] you remember the little boy
[48:39] the preacher said my throat short i
[48:41] can't hardly talk and the little boy
[48:42] said
[48:44] you hotter'd you know hollered
[48:46] in the church and said the lord don't
[48:48] like for you to holler in the church
[48:51] and that was why the preacher had the
[48:52] bad throat so maybe i'll holler too much
[48:55] all right
[48:57] and see while i'm at it
[49:00] i said something about
[49:03] people going out
[49:05] last week
[49:07] and i asked you to be respectable to
[49:10] wait until the scripture was through
[49:11] reading
[49:13] then go out
[49:15] i've never been against anybody going to
[49:16] the bathroom
[49:17] you need to go you go to the bathroom
[49:20] i've never been against anybody that
[49:22] has a problem with diabetics
[49:25] or something that you have to do
[49:27] but why don't you simply
[49:30] put your
[49:31] peppermint candy
[49:33] in your pocket
[49:34] and slip it in your mouth
[49:37] you know
[49:40] i wouldn't say a thing if you come and
[49:41] told me that well i've got to have water
[49:44] you know ever so often
[49:46] well i wouldn't say a thing to see you
[49:48] just take it
[49:49] in a little sip but don't turn it up and
[49:51] google it that's what everybody
[49:53] love it look look
[49:57] hear some of you been here and hear you
[49:59] sneeze
[50:00] i get so tickled at that
[50:03] you're supposed to stifle a sneeze
[50:06] because i too that means everybody in
[50:08] the building just got a good bath in my
[50:10] germs
[50:12] you snout at you
[50:15] but you ain't gonna do it because you've
[50:17] done it all your life that's the ego
[50:19] okay get off of it brother dale
[50:23] that stirs this old boy up
[50:25] to see our egos
[50:27] and you're not going to take correction
[50:31] but i ain't said a word about anybody
[50:32] going to the bathroom
[50:34] i ain't said a word about anybody having
[50:36] to
[50:36] put a piece of peppermint candy in their
[50:38] mouth because that they were a diabetic
[50:40] or something
[50:43] they never been that away i ain't that
[50:44] away and i'm not going to be that way
[50:47] sometimes when i talk it sounds like
[50:49] that's what i'm doing
[50:50] but you just remember i just put a cough
[50:52] drop in there was a day i was against
[50:54] putting anything in your mouth
[50:56] it was a day i wouldn't in no way put a
[50:58] cough drop in
[51:01] but it's either put the cough drop in or
[51:03] i can't preach
[51:05] and if you can't
[51:07] exist without
[51:09] having to go to the bathroom
[51:11] all i ask you to do is not do it while
[51:14] the scripture is being dread
[51:17] i was trying to be nice about it just to
[51:19] do that
[51:20] but that's all right i know i
[51:23] the way i am i'm sorry
[51:25] but listen now get back to the point
[51:28] you ever thought about it
[51:32] wade had it wednesday night
[51:37] he didn't curse adam
[51:40] and he didn't curse eve
[51:44] right
[51:45] right that's where brother brown gave it
[51:46] future home he could pull it up you pull
[51:48] up number six you know two words to make
[51:50] sure that people can read it
[51:55] he didn't curse adam
[51:57] and he didn't curse eve
[52:00] he might have done the same things no
[52:02] but he didn't he didn't curse eve
[52:04] but said adam would be her ruler
[52:07] and thanks
[52:09] all right
[52:10] that's paragraph 325 the future home
[52:17] have you ever thought about why they
[52:18] didn't get cursed
[52:24] now i won't get through this evening
[52:25] without what i got but we'll go as far
[52:28] as we can go
[52:30] you ever thought about why they didn't
[52:31] get cursed
[52:38] you see adam had eternal life
[52:42] in his soul according to blasphemous
[52:43] names right
[52:45] all right
[52:46] brother brown said especially into adam
[52:50] he gave him eternal life
[52:54] all right
[52:56] how could he curse eternal life
[53:02] you mean god was going to come down and
[53:03] because man done wrong he come down and
[53:06] cursed the very beginning of mankind
[53:09] cursed adam
[53:11] no
[53:15] he made an atonement for him we'll get
[53:16] to that after a while
[53:19] he made a covering he knew that's what
[53:21] he's going to do
[53:22] because adam and eve in the garden and
[53:24] satan the beast etc
[53:26] was going to help god bring out his plan
[53:29] and finish it of being a savior a healer
[53:32] a deliverer et cetera
[53:34] all by his foreknowledge
[53:37] of predestination
[53:40] but if he to curse adam
[53:44] he'd have been cursing his own self
[53:47] i'd write that down
[53:50] i thought lord i got to cover that
[53:53] if he'd accursed adam the bible said
[53:56] adam was the son of god
[53:59] brother branham blasphemius name said
[54:01] adam had eternal life in his soul
[54:06] his inner being
[54:08] god's own life he said
[54:11] well how could he curse him
[54:16] all right so he didn't curse eve
[54:21] because i believe she had eternal life
[54:24] in her soul
[54:27] all right
[54:28] but he could curse the beast
[54:31] he could curse the serpent
[54:35] he could put the snake on his belly he
[54:37] could i mean the beast on his belly to
[54:39] make a snake
[54:41] he could curse the serpent which is
[54:42] satan
[54:44] because he didn't have eternal life
[54:52] wade was covering our wednesday how
[54:54] could he curse
[54:55] sarah
[54:58] that's right
[55:00] how could goss curse sarah
[55:04] why because she was part of abraham
[55:07] how could he curse eve because she was a
[55:09] part of adam
[55:14] what about it
[55:18] he was their father
[55:21] their creator
[55:23] and he couldn't curse eve he couldn't
[55:25] curse adam
[55:27] because they had eternal life let's read
[55:29] this one now go ahead with number seven
[55:31] let's just read this
[55:32] one sir as we would see jesus 1964 304
[55:37] paragraph 68-69
[55:39] and sarah tried to deny it but being
[55:42] that she was part of abraham
[55:44] her unbelief would have condemned her
[55:48] but god could not take her because she
[55:51] was a part of abraham
[55:53] the church would have been condemned
[55:55] long ago
[55:58] but it's part of christ
[56:02] he never cursed adam he never cursed eve
[56:05] because they had eternal life
[56:08] he can't give you eternal life and curse
[56:10] you
[56:13] we can be children that are disobedient
[56:15] and he can let things come to us and
[56:17] line us up and give us weapons
[56:21] but you never reject us
[56:25] right
[56:28] i'm looking back in the garden and
[56:30] seeing that point
[56:32] see he would have been cursing himself
[56:37] if he'd give you the new birth
[56:41] how can he curse you
[56:45] yeah brother dale i just feel like that
[56:48] i'm just i'm i'm just condemned for
[56:50] being
[56:51] we may be carrying life things that we
[56:54] went through that are not i've done we
[56:56] maybe carry the marks of that
[56:59] but just remember
[57:01] you'll never be cursed
[57:07] why
[57:08] i want to get back to it later the
[57:09] reason i'm not using the scripture but
[57:11] we just read the scripture there where
[57:13] he promised to see to the woman to come
[57:15] i'll put enmity between thy seed and the
[57:16] seed of the woman i want to get onto
[57:18] that on the whole message
[57:20] but i want you to think about it
[57:24] he never cursed adam and eve
[57:27] because they were part of him
[57:30] all we got to do is make sure
[57:33] that we have him in us
[57:36] then we don't have to worry about a fall
[57:38] a curse or anything
[57:41] we don't have to be concerned about it
[57:44] all right
[57:45] so you get to point now and we'll move
[57:46] on into the afternoon's message or
[57:48] or get
[57:51] you know part of it
[57:57] he cursed
[58:02] the serpent
[58:06] we'll have to get over in another
[58:07] scripture where it covers and and you
[58:09] know the the uh
[58:11] the serpent then was made uh i mean the
[58:13] the beast was made of snake the beast
[58:16] was cursed on the bases that it was
[58:18] made of snake
[58:20] all right
[58:21] made a reptile
[58:26] but you know what
[58:33] that beast as i said was
[58:36] an animal
[58:41] and it wasn't
[58:43] wrong itself
[58:46] but it was used to do something wrong
[58:49] god said all right animal
[58:51] he was used
[58:53] now animal will be used for the
[58:55] atonement
[58:57] all of those animals back there were
[58:59] sacrificed
[59:01] on the altar before god
[59:03] to make an atonement
[59:06] because animal was the cause and
[59:09] animal being that point
[59:12] all right
[59:16] now in case you get messed up in it
[59:20] just remember the point
[59:23] that he can call the
[59:27] beast
[59:28] the serpent
[59:31] he could be speaking straight to satan
[59:32] and call him the serpent
[59:36] you get over in the book of revelations
[59:38] and he talks about that old serpent
[59:41] the devil
[59:45] he can use those words as serpent and
[59:48] beast
[59:49] that's why it's called the seed of the
[59:50] serpent
[59:52] it wasn't called the seed of the beast
[59:56] even though the seed of the beast is
[59:58] what polluted the human race
[1:00:01] defiled it
[1:00:04] but the seed of the serpent was the
[1:00:06] unbelief
[1:00:09] that was given to eve
[1:00:11] but it'll all be called the seed of the
[1:00:13] serpent
[1:00:14] i'll get back to the message on that
[1:00:16] later or not in today
[1:00:20] but see putting it together we see that
[1:00:24] eve was beguiled by the serpent the
[1:00:26] bible would say
[1:00:29] and then we can say e was defiled by the
[1:00:31] serpent
[1:00:32] because you know what you're talking
[1:00:33] about
[1:00:36] see satan had no ability to defile ever
[1:00:42] he could be beguiler or deceiver
[1:00:45] but there had to be an attribute
[1:00:48] of that unbelief
[1:00:52] and that goes through to show
[1:00:54] you know what's taking place
[1:00:57] all right
[1:00:58] now
[1:01:00] let's jump over into the
[1:01:03] message a little further
[1:01:10] to where we can get an understanding
[1:01:12] without having to preach two different
[1:01:13] messages
[1:01:15] so forgive me
[1:01:20] i want you to think about something
[1:01:25] and there's many reasons to get you to
[1:01:27] think on this point
[1:01:32] one reason is for me to
[1:01:35] try to get to you an understanding of
[1:01:36] how real god is
[1:01:40] people that well god is a spirit
[1:01:47] we believe that
[1:01:50] i believe that that's bible
[1:01:53] but how real is your god
[1:02:00] we just read in our scripture reading
[1:02:02] there
[1:02:05] that it says god
[1:02:09] made coats of skin
[1:02:12] for adam and eve
[1:02:16] now what do you think he got them coats
[1:02:18] of skins
[1:02:20] well he just created him
[1:02:24] well
[1:02:27] if he created him
[1:02:31] are you just making him a creator to
[1:02:33] create the skins
[1:02:38] now brother branham said he killed those
[1:02:40] animals
[1:02:44] most people would say well my god is not
[1:02:46] real like that well you need another god
[1:02:51] because you're out of the bible
[1:02:56] remember the prophet do you need these
[1:02:57] he said we were going out of the garden
[1:03:01] he said those bloody skins
[1:03:05] flopping on their legs
[1:03:10] they were bloody
[1:03:12] did god create bloody skins
[1:03:18] no
[1:03:20] he killed the animals
[1:03:23] showing the first atonement
[1:03:25] that was made
[1:03:27] was an animal sacrifice all right or we
[1:03:30] write then what we were talking about
[1:03:34] animal was used
[1:03:37] in the wrong act
[1:03:39] now it's going to be used as an
[1:03:41] atonement
[1:03:42] so that don't look too bad to the
[1:03:44] animals does it
[1:03:48] you know he's the god of the animals as
[1:03:50] well as he's the god of the human being
[1:03:53] he loves those animals and things
[1:03:58] he took the skins off of those animals
[1:04:05] and he made an atonement
[1:04:08] he said but i just don't brother dale i
[1:04:09] just don't go along with you that god
[1:04:11] said what kind of a god do you have i'm
[1:04:13] just honest
[1:04:16] well god it's just a spirit
[1:04:18] see that's our
[1:04:19] our understanding of
[1:04:24] what we think has figured out the bible
[1:04:27] don't you believe the bible
[1:04:30] yeah
[1:04:32] what the same bible says
[1:04:36] heaven is my throne
[1:04:38] earth is my footstool
[1:04:44] so
[1:04:45] he's got a bottom
[1:04:48] he can sit down on the throne
[1:04:53] and the earth is his footsteps he's got
[1:04:55] feet
[1:04:57] the bible talks about the heart of god
[1:05:02] the bible talks about him being the head
[1:05:08] it talks about the arms
[1:05:12] it talks about the eyes
[1:05:15] the mouth
[1:05:17] the snow the nose
[1:05:20] remember my nostrils are fully
[1:05:23] he talks about being able to hear
[1:05:28] but brother tale he's just a spirit
[1:05:33] all right the doctrine came in the
[1:05:35] message
[1:05:36] years ago
[1:05:38] around the message people
[1:05:40] that god was just like the wind just
[1:05:41] floating around
[1:05:45] so brother branham
[1:05:47] is the one that said these things
[1:05:49] he said he's not like to win he said god
[1:05:51] is a being
[1:05:59] we could go through a long lengthy talk
[1:06:01] about that couldn't we
[1:06:04] how that moses saw the back part of a
[1:06:06] man
[1:06:09] he said in the same back that later
[1:06:12] was walking on the shores of galilee
[1:06:15] one of them's a theophany the other one
[1:06:17] is a literal person
[1:06:19] what do you think god looked like jesus
[1:06:25] why because he's his father
[1:06:28] and i told you when we get to heaven
[1:06:30] it's not going to be a father over here
[1:06:32] a holy ghost over here and a jesus here
[1:06:38] we're going to see him
[1:06:40] and know who he is
[1:06:42] because i believe in real god
[1:06:46] and when i read here that the prophet
[1:06:48] said that god killed the animals
[1:06:51] i believe he took the skin
[1:06:53] and ripped them off
[1:06:56] why because it's bloody
[1:06:58] because the same prophet said to
[1:07:00] they walked out of the garden with the
[1:07:02] bloody skins flopping on them
[1:07:05] we'll read one in a minute where brother
[1:07:06] around said
[1:07:07] god made a blood atonement
[1:07:14] who offered the first sacrifice adam no
[1:07:19] they don't even talk about adam and eve
[1:07:20] with sacrifices
[1:07:22] the first physical sacrifice of humanity
[1:07:26] was when cain and abel
[1:07:29] i'm not saying they didn't do it before
[1:07:31] then but i'm saying scripturally
[1:07:36] you see god was the first murderer
[1:07:40] because he had to make atonement for a
[1:07:42] man that had died
[1:07:45] mankind
[1:07:47] he made an atonement
[1:07:49] he didn't have to build a fire
[1:07:52] because that would come later
[1:07:56] and to prove that it will come later in
[1:07:57] the right doings
[1:08:02] abel
[1:08:03] it says brought his offering
[1:08:06] and god consumed it with fire
[1:08:11] that's the kind of offering i want to
[1:08:12] make sure that i believe in
[1:08:14] is a god that can consume it
[1:08:17] with fire
[1:08:19] but i just want you to think about it
[1:08:25] look what brother randall says here on
[1:08:27] the message
[1:08:28] go ahead to number eight now on the
[1:08:31] evening message notes okay
[1:08:36] verse 21
[1:08:38] of what we read it talks about how that
[1:08:40] god
[1:08:42] you know made coats of skin
[1:08:46] placed it on adam and eve and they went
[1:08:48] out of the garden
[1:08:49] there is a quote if you want it i didn't
[1:08:51] bring it because i figured it in order
[1:08:52] to be enough brother brown said when
[1:08:54] they started out of that garden with
[1:08:56] that blood flapping on their legs
[1:08:58] that's when god said
[1:09:00] i'll put enmity between thy seed and the
[1:09:02] seed of the woman the promise of the
[1:09:04] messiah
[1:09:05] so look what he says now
[1:09:09] drop down to kind of the life's
[1:09:11] paragraph
[1:09:13] starting here who told you you were
[1:09:14] naked
[1:09:16] then they started as always they call in
[1:09:17] the army passing a book one to the other
[1:09:20] god looked around and he found a tree a
[1:09:22] certain place a place that he thought
[1:09:24] would be beautiful
[1:09:26] and he got some skins and threw them
[1:09:28] back in the bushes and said cover
[1:09:30] yourself with this and come out before
[1:09:32] me
[1:09:33] and god
[1:09:36] had to do that part
[1:09:38] they had a conference they talked it
[1:09:40] over
[1:09:41] then god made a preparation for them
[1:09:43] well i'm so glad there was an
[1:09:45] eden
[1:09:46] conference then he goes on to the
[1:09:49] getting away from the fig leaves but god
[1:09:51] looked around found a tree a certain
[1:09:53] place
[1:09:54] and he got some skins and he threw them
[1:09:56] back in the bushes
[1:09:58] all right
[1:10:02] where are we at because i didn't mark
[1:10:04] them see them
[1:10:05] so he sewed them together but god killed
[1:10:08] something to cover their sins and gave a
[1:10:11] promise
[1:10:12] that through the woman's seed
[1:10:14] would crush the serpent's heal
[1:10:17] god killed them
[1:10:20] but my god is just not like that
[1:10:23] you remember here a while back someone
[1:10:24] was saying but my god can't have a
[1:10:26] headache
[1:10:31] well
[1:10:33] i'm sorry that i've got a decent memory
[1:10:37] but if he says that
[1:10:40] your nostrils as your offerings has
[1:10:42] become a stink in my nostrils
[1:10:44] you must have an upset stomach
[1:10:49] you know
[1:10:50] but see we think that sounds good my god
[1:10:52] can't do these things
[1:10:54] who are you
[1:10:55] i'm not nothing but me who are you
[1:11:00] we're talking about what the bible says
[1:11:01] what the prophet said
[1:11:03] that god killed the animals
[1:11:07] all right
[1:11:08] look at the next one
[1:11:10] way to fellowship 1955 1009.
[1:11:17] paragraph e33
[1:11:19] all right
[1:11:21] but he went up anyhow because there was
[1:11:23] one soul calling for him just thank
[1:11:25] cross the stormy lakes over the cross
[1:11:26] there to find one soul
[1:11:28] that was needed needed soul of love all
[1:11:30] right so then when sin came in it
[1:11:33] separated man from fellowship
[1:11:35] notice what god did to bring man back to
[1:11:37] fellowship
[1:11:39] he introduced to the world
[1:11:42] of blood redemption
[1:11:45] god killed animals
[1:11:47] and put their skin
[1:11:49] showing a blood redemption
[1:11:51] and their god after being separated from
[1:11:54] it from his created creatures
[1:11:56] god laid out the welcome mat
[1:12:00] back home
[1:12:01] by the shedding of the blood
[1:12:03] and don't that make you feel
[1:12:06] and that was then and has been and will
[1:12:08] always be
[1:12:10] god provided a preparation for
[1:12:11] fellowship with him is through
[1:12:14] the shed blood
[1:12:17] what about god kill the animals
[1:12:19] god made the first atonement go ahead to
[1:12:22] number 10.
[1:12:25] fellowship 1956
[1:12:27] 212 courses like wade says they're
[1:12:29] saying now that we only believe you know
[1:12:31] that that's not a new doctrine that
[1:12:33] they're saying we only believe what's
[1:12:34] after 65.
[1:12:37] well
[1:12:40] you know 63 the seals
[1:12:47] i say you can't understand
[1:12:51] the opening of the seals
[1:12:53] if you don't understand what he preached
[1:12:55] before then
[1:12:59] that's where i take my stay
[1:13:01] yeah but he was wrong show me
[1:13:05] i want you to show me where he was wrong
[1:13:08] because everything you can show me he
[1:13:09] was wrong he corrected
[1:13:15] right
[1:13:17] and most of them was corrected before
[1:13:18] the opening of the seals
[1:13:23] but yeah see that's that
[1:13:25] devil getting into the mind
[1:13:28] and reached look at ours
[1:13:30] brother branham didn't know what he's
[1:13:31] talking about i wonder how many other
[1:13:33] people found that
[1:13:34] i'll get on the internet and see how
[1:13:36] many of you have ever studied where
[1:13:37] we've run around so and so then he said
[1:13:39] so and so and he's contradictory what
[1:13:41] are you doing
[1:13:42] where does it get out of the message
[1:13:48] oh don't you don't want to do that do
[1:13:49] you
[1:13:50] why don't you burn your books
[1:13:53] if he was wrong here right here who's
[1:13:55] who is the one that can can correct him
[1:13:59] oh it's you
[1:14:00] and that's the devil
[1:14:02] in what he's doing
[1:14:04] he's still deceiving as he did eve
[1:14:09] trying to make you doubt the message
[1:14:13] right
[1:14:15] but look
[1:14:19] now since sin broke that fellowship man
[1:14:21] has been tossed about remember when the
[1:14:23] doctrine
[1:14:24] and he still tossed about
[1:14:26] he was turned down the garden of eden to
[1:14:28] shift for himself
[1:14:29] and then that great thing he's still
[1:14:31] tossing about
[1:14:35] god made one preparation for a man to be
[1:14:37] restored back to the fellowship
[1:14:39] oh no nothing else we have tried he
[1:14:43] offered to the human race
[1:14:46] blood was the way back to fellowship
[1:14:49] god killed some animals and took their
[1:14:51] skins
[1:14:52] she had the innocent blood of the animal
[1:14:54] and brought the skin and wrapped adam
[1:14:56] and eve in it
[1:14:58] and fellowship with them again
[1:15:00] after the shedding of the blood
[1:15:04] he goes on to explain that's god's way
[1:15:05] of doing it now
[1:15:07] it's through the blood of jesus christ
[1:15:11] how many quotes would you like on this
[1:15:15] that god killed jesus
[1:15:17] run in your computer when you get home
[1:15:22] just run it in your computer to go home
[1:15:24] see how many times brought around said
[1:15:25] god killed jesus
[1:15:32] but yeah we think that god is just a
[1:15:34] spirit he can't do anything like that he
[1:15:36] can't pull that skins off of animals
[1:15:38] what kind of a god you got then
[1:15:41] if your prophet said he killed him and
[1:15:42] brought her blood atonement why can't we
[1:15:43] believe that
[1:15:46] why can't we accept it and believe it
[1:15:50] and have understanding
[1:15:53] and believe that god promised
[1:15:56] right there
[1:15:58] in the garden
[1:15:59] i'll put enmity between thy seed and the
[1:16:01] seed of the woman
[1:16:03] he had already made the atonement
[1:16:07] i've got one at home we'll get to it
[1:16:09] wade didn't know it he was quoting it
[1:16:10] wednesday
[1:16:12] and he said see there in the garden said
[1:16:14] god made an unconditional covenant
[1:16:16] brother branham says that
[1:16:20] but but i didn't think the unconditional
[1:16:22] covenant come to abraham
[1:16:25] it's like brother
[1:16:28] chris said today and he walked up to me
[1:16:30] and he said brother dale i think well i
[1:16:33] didn't i was talking some of them he
[1:16:35] said brother dale i think i said you
[1:16:36] ain't got no right to think
[1:16:41] you see we think
[1:16:44] this can't be right
[1:16:47] god made a blood atonement for you and i
[1:16:50] he made a blood atonement for adam and
[1:16:51] eve
[1:16:55] he died himself for you and i
[1:16:58] the prophet said he tore
[1:17:00] that life out of that body
[1:17:05] god killed to make an atonement
[1:17:09] you think that ain't predestination
[1:17:15] he knew he was going to fall right
[1:17:17] we've been through that enough right for
[1:17:19] knowledge let him know he's going to
[1:17:20] fall
[1:17:21] for knowledge let him know he'd have to
[1:17:23] kill the animals
[1:17:25] he'd have to make the atonement for you
[1:17:27] and i
[1:17:31] a blood atonement
[1:17:35] but around him said abel
[1:17:38] saw it was the blood
[1:17:42] he said he's seen that we are born what
[1:17:46] what is the seed of man
[1:17:49] highly congealed blood
[1:17:54] and he said we are we're seeing that god
[1:17:57] seen that or abel's scene excuse me
[1:18:01] that he was born in his mama's blood
[1:18:03] from his daddy's blood
[1:18:06] so he made a blood atonement
[1:18:10] but cain now where did cain we'll get to
[1:18:13] that as we're going down
[1:18:16] where did cain get the idea
[1:18:19] of fruit
[1:18:26] how many did it just jump out of the sky
[1:18:32] where'd he get it from
[1:18:36] he got it from his mama
[1:18:40] because he sure didn't get it from his
[1:18:41] daddy
[1:18:44] his daddy who was cain's daddy
[1:18:49] he wound up to be in the serpent and he
[1:18:51] could talk to him yeah i understand that
[1:18:54] what i'm saying who talked to him
[1:18:58] because you moved up to that time that
[1:18:59] you had adam and eve
[1:19:01] don't you think adam told abel what it
[1:19:04] was all about
[1:19:06] but you know mama was so convincing
[1:19:09] until she told kane what happened
[1:19:11] you say you don't have no proof that you
[1:19:13] don't have any proof contrary
[1:19:16] we solve that problem
[1:19:20] right
[1:19:23] where did cain get that idea
[1:19:27] because mama got the idea of the fig
[1:19:29] leaves
[1:19:33] right remember this morning
[1:19:36] brother brown said they were back in
[1:19:37] there having church
[1:19:40] but i don't think adam was preaching
[1:19:45] i think eve was preaching
[1:19:52] cain probably said because hey remember
[1:19:54] when it comes up to cain and abel and
[1:19:56] offering the officer i remember they
[1:19:58] were grown men
[1:20:00] uh and have five-year-old kids making
[1:20:02] offerings okay
[1:20:04] it was grown men
[1:20:07] whatever age you want to put it 18 20
[1:20:09] what do you want to put it
[1:20:12] they were grown men
[1:20:17] you think about it
[1:20:22] god spoke to abel
[1:20:24] but he couldn't get the cane
[1:20:29] why because somebody already deceived
[1:20:31] him
[1:20:33] when we get on down in a little bit
[1:20:36] think about it
[1:20:39] so now let's let's read some scripture
[1:20:40] and let's go ahead
[1:20:42] and just read a couple of things and
[1:20:45] just go as far as we can
[1:20:48] go to genesis 4
[1:20:51] that we read this morning
[1:20:55] number 11.
[1:20:58] and adam knew his wife
[1:21:01] and she conceived
[1:21:03] and bear came
[1:21:05] and said i've gotten a man from the lord
[1:21:10] and see again by his brother abel the
[1:21:13] neighbor was a keeper the sheep cane was
[1:21:15] still under the ground
[1:21:19] one time it says
[1:21:22] he knew her
[1:21:25] and two babies was born
[1:21:30] you said but but brother dale the bible
[1:21:33] said and adam knew his wife i agree with
[1:21:35] you he did
[1:21:39] and she conceived she did
[1:21:45] but see she takes over and explaining
[1:21:48] about cain
[1:21:51] she's the one that said i got a man from
[1:21:52] the lord
[1:21:55] right
[1:21:56] and said i have gotten a man from the
[1:21:58] lord
[1:22:00] she
[1:22:04] never credited brother branham said
[1:22:07] as to god bringing forth
[1:22:11] cain
[1:22:14] i mean excuse me as as adam bringing
[1:22:16] forth came
[1:22:18] but she said
[1:22:20] god gave her a seed
[1:22:23] all right now next time he knew her
[1:22:26] he knew his wife again and she bought a
[1:22:28] son and called his name seth
[1:22:30] that's number three child right
[1:22:33] so there's two conceivings and three
[1:22:35] children so there's got to be some twins
[1:22:37] somewhere
[1:22:40] right
[1:22:41] so cain and naval were twins
[1:22:47] the beast was the father of cain and
[1:22:49] we'll get to it
[1:22:51] and adam was the father of abel
[1:22:55] we're going to prove that in the
[1:22:55] scripture in just a minute
[1:22:57] all right because that's what i'm
[1:22:58] wanting to do with the scriptures
[1:23:00] but there were twins there
[1:23:03] he said ain't no bible says twins
[1:23:06] you know the bible says judas went and
[1:23:08] hung himself and you go do like what
[1:23:14] he said you're being sarcastic no i'm
[1:23:15] not
[1:23:18] i'm showing you you're twisting
[1:23:19] scriptures
[1:23:21] read it
[1:23:23] adam knew his wife and she conceived
[1:23:28] i agree with that she conceived he knew
[1:23:29] her
[1:23:31] but look and bear cane and said
[1:23:34] who
[1:23:36] is saying it
[1:23:40] come on read your bible and she
[1:23:42] conceived
[1:23:43] she's the one talking from this point
[1:23:45] all the way down
[1:23:49] she's the one that said i have gotten a
[1:23:51] man from the lord
[1:23:57] see we want to say that cain was the
[1:24:00] that adam was the father of cain we'll
[1:24:02] get to it after a while show me anywhere
[1:24:05] in any bible lineage
[1:24:08] whatsoever
[1:24:11] that cain come from adam
[1:24:15] i want to read it
[1:24:21] the last scripture we get to probably
[1:24:23] wins to be then it said enoch was the
[1:24:25] seventh from adam
[1:24:27] that's in the book of jude
[1:24:30] all right if you put cain in there in
[1:24:32] abel and coming down
[1:24:35] you got eight
[1:24:38] come on
[1:24:42] but there's a great group of people
[1:24:44] around the country
[1:24:46] that
[1:24:47] teaches
[1:24:49] and they teach that tubular king
[1:24:52] we won't say much about it because i'm
[1:24:54] not arguing no point with nobody
[1:24:56] i'll just say
[1:24:58] they run it down on cain's lineage
[1:25:03] let's see kane's lineage goes the wrong
[1:25:05] way
[1:25:08] you come to tubercane
[1:25:10] on king's lineage
[1:25:15] you come to enoch
[1:25:18] on god's lineage
[1:25:19] it's being number seven
[1:25:23] okay
[1:25:26] yeah i don't like to talk too much about
[1:25:28] the world and they're doing because they
[1:25:29] can believe what they want to
[1:25:30] but i'm just telling you
[1:25:32] it won't line up
[1:25:34] all right watch now
[1:25:40] adam knew his wife again genesis 4 25
[1:25:44] and see by our son
[1:25:47] and called his name saith
[1:25:49] for god
[1:25:50] said
[1:25:52] now for god said she
[1:25:57] what's now
[1:25:58] hath appointed me another seed instead
[1:26:01] of abel whom cain's slew
[1:26:06] hath appointed
[1:26:09] because see cain couldn't be
[1:26:11] the promised seed to the woman
[1:26:14] that was jesus christ
[1:26:17] so that's why she said
[1:26:18] have to point it didn't say gave
[1:26:24] seth was just appointed to bring the
[1:26:26] human race forward
[1:26:30] he was not the seed
[1:26:32] that the woman was promised to
[1:26:34] bring all right
[1:26:38] see then it don't match up let's go on
[1:26:39] to the next all right
[1:26:46] brother branham says praise 12 i mean
[1:26:49] prayer got 12 65
[1:26:51] 911
[1:26:52] god's power to transform
[1:26:55] that
[1:26:56] cain and abel were twins that's enough
[1:26:58] we got it we don't have to worry about
[1:27:00] that it ought to be enough for anybody
[1:27:01] to know it
[1:27:02] but they were twins let's go on to the
[1:27:04] scripture now
[1:27:06] go to genesis 4
[1:27:10] remember
[1:27:13] and again she by his brother abel
[1:27:17] and abel was a keeper that she became
[1:27:19] was the tiller of the ground
[1:27:20] in the process of time it came to past
[1:27:22] it came
[1:27:23] brought of the fruit of the ground an
[1:27:25] offering
[1:27:27] unto the lord
[1:27:28] now what i'm wanting to do this
[1:27:30] afternoon this morning was
[1:27:32] to go from
[1:27:34] the spiritual condition of just in our
[1:27:36] mind there being into the physical
[1:27:38] condition
[1:27:39] of the human race that was degraded by
[1:27:42] the injection of the beast
[1:27:44] all right but what i want you to think
[1:27:45] about today
[1:27:46] what did all of that produce
[1:27:53] and if we can't see there's something
[1:27:54] wrong with us spiritually
[1:27:58] what was the after effects what was the
[1:28:00] thing
[1:28:01] what did it produce
[1:28:05] and improve where it come from right so
[1:28:07] you can prove that cain never come from
[1:28:08] adam
[1:28:10] because of what happens
[1:28:13] all right
[1:28:15] so think about it
[1:28:19] in the process of time
[1:28:21] cain brought in the fruit of the ground
[1:28:22] and offering to the lord
[1:28:24] and abel he also brought her the first
[1:28:26] thing of his flock of the fat thereof
[1:28:28] and lord had respect unto abel and his
[1:28:30] offering but it came in his offering he
[1:28:32] had not respect and cain was very wroth
[1:28:35] in his countenance fell
[1:28:36] and the lord said unto cain why wroth
[1:28:39] and why is thy canon has falling
[1:28:45] wrong sacrifice
[1:28:48] right
[1:28:51] hey i've been through it with the
[1:28:53] preachers in this message
[1:28:55] where it said
[1:28:56] uh
[1:28:58] abel offered a more excellent sacrifice
[1:29:01] than cain
[1:29:02] that's scripture
[1:29:03] the brother right here trying to prove
[1:29:05] it one time said see there see cain's
[1:29:07] offering was excellent
[1:29:11] because the bible said abel's was more
[1:29:13] excellent
[1:29:17] i said what did cain's offering speak of
[1:29:21] he said well
[1:29:24] it did speak of works
[1:29:27] i said well then are you saying that
[1:29:28] works is our salvation
[1:29:35] blood's only salvation or yet
[1:29:40] cain's offering was just speaking of
[1:29:42] man's kind working himself to death but
[1:29:44] it'll do him no good
[1:29:48] all right but think about it now
[1:29:53] what happens to make a man
[1:29:57] get upset
[1:29:59] when god rejects his sacrifice
[1:30:05] may i ask this question
[1:30:07] why do preachers get mad when somebody
[1:30:08] can preach
[1:30:10] something that they can't
[1:30:13] and their countenance changes and
[1:30:15] they scream and holler and jump up down
[1:30:17] like one did here in the pulpit one day
[1:30:19] in a minister's meeting and his own
[1:30:21] daughter downstairs said well that's him
[1:30:23] them uh black folks they're a little you
[1:30:25] know emotional what they're saying
[1:30:27] didn't know she's talking about her
[1:30:28] daddy
[1:30:30] he was up here jumping up and down
[1:30:32] hollering and screaming get off that
[1:30:34] topic
[1:30:38] why don't you count on us fall
[1:30:46] what is your fault sometimes when i say
[1:30:48] something
[1:30:57] we're supposed to believe that the
[1:30:58] lord's directing us to do but that's all
[1:31:01] right brother dale there's a lot but
[1:31:02] what you said about me
[1:31:07] egos
[1:31:10] but think about it
[1:31:13] abel knew it was blood
[1:31:16] cain thought it was fruit
[1:31:19] you know a beautiful offering flowers
[1:31:22] everything
[1:31:23] and you know sensibly speaking
[1:31:28] cain's offer looked beautiful
[1:31:31] he worked himself to death
[1:31:34] he
[1:31:35] maybe planted
[1:31:36] and done things and brought all kinds of
[1:31:38] stuff
[1:31:40] maple just laying up there and watching
[1:31:43] them sheep bro
[1:31:47] right
[1:31:49] one day he picks out one he says you it
[1:31:51] buddy
[1:31:54] he takes him and kills him
[1:31:57] god looks down and said hey well you're
[1:31:59] right
[1:32:03] cain
[1:32:05] yours is wrong
[1:32:10] now
[1:32:12] i want to ask you the question
[1:32:15] because i know this doctrine is among
[1:32:16] the people that may say don't just ask
[1:32:18] you here
[1:32:19] do you believe that cain could have been
[1:32:21] saved
[1:32:24] i don't ask you to raise your hand
[1:32:26] but according to a lot of the people in
[1:32:28] the message
[1:32:30] cain could have never been saved
[1:32:32] because if you happen to be of the
[1:32:34] lineage of adam
[1:32:36] you know or abel
[1:32:38] you can be saved but if you're the
[1:32:40] lineage of the beast or cain
[1:32:43] you can't be saved you have never heard
[1:32:45] them things preached yeah
[1:32:48] now so that means that all serpent seed
[1:32:51] has no hopes
[1:32:54] and boy they don't like for me to talk
[1:32:56] cause i say every one of us
[1:32:59] man woman child brother for adam and all
[1:33:06] once that seed was injected into that
[1:33:08] human race by that beast every baby that
[1:33:11] covered that wound is polluted
[1:33:16] amen at least you know where i stand
[1:33:20] you don't have to guess
[1:33:23] brother branham what about you he said i
[1:33:25] was a hybrid
[1:33:29] we're all born illegitimate
[1:33:31] you know because you know what brother
[1:33:32] brown said was born
[1:33:34] he said with all all born
[1:33:36] between
[1:33:37] the serpent and eve
[1:33:40] that's what he said
[1:33:43] all of us was born between the serpent
[1:33:46] and eve
[1:33:47] why would he say it like that when the
[1:33:49] serpent don't have no seed
[1:33:52] he didn't say with all born
[1:33:54] with the beast
[1:33:56] no
[1:33:57] that's why it says it we read there
[1:34:00] eve is the mother of all living
[1:34:05] that's why a lot of people you know they
[1:34:06] believe in illegal aliens and all these
[1:34:08] things and outer worlds and other
[1:34:10] generations of people that was created
[1:34:13] and all kind of doctrines
[1:34:15] i said according to bible he's the
[1:34:17] mother of all living if there's any
[1:34:18] monkeys out there on mars they come from
[1:34:20] here
[1:34:22] because they use the mother of all
[1:34:24] living
[1:34:27] but why can't we be plain
[1:34:31] what are the course that we got
[1:34:35] i thought the bible said the truth has
[1:34:36] set you free
[1:34:39] all right
[1:34:40] we're talking about it last night
[1:34:42] while we're eating
[1:34:43] i told him i said the only thing that
[1:34:45] can
[1:34:47] do us any good is a reveal word
[1:34:53] the only thing
[1:34:56] he said but i just don't believe cain
[1:34:58] could be saved well let's just read
[1:35:01] all right go ahead with number
[1:35:03] 16
[1:35:06] which is genesis 4 and 7
[1:35:08] and god is saying this
[1:35:10] if thou doest well
[1:35:14] shalt not
[1:35:16] shalt thou
[1:35:17] not be
[1:35:19] accepted
[1:35:22] if thou doest well shalt thou not be
[1:35:24] accepted
[1:35:27] all right
[1:35:29] and if thou doest not well
[1:35:33] do you double state in this opportunity
[1:35:35] to be well
[1:35:38] seen life at the door
[1:35:44] if you don't do good what's going to
[1:35:46] happen
[1:35:47] sin will be his desire and i shall
[1:35:50] rule over him but if you can overcome it
[1:35:53] sin can't rule you
[1:35:57] but i i just don't see well all right we
[1:35:59] let brother my master then you arguing
[1:36:01] with him see
[1:36:02] all right go ahead number 17.
[1:36:06] 1959
[1:36:07] all the days of our life
[1:36:11] e19
[1:36:14] let's drop down here to save reading and
[1:36:16] read all the way down through
[1:36:18] god still loved him
[1:36:20] okay let's drop back the best
[1:36:23] let's read it okay because this is a
[1:36:24] good one run it back down
[1:36:27] and he's so much like cain cain wanted
[1:36:30] to be religious so he went and made his
[1:36:32] own religion and when he did he brought
[1:36:34] it before god
[1:36:35] with something like this here's the best
[1:36:37] i got
[1:36:38] this is all i can do about it
[1:36:41] now take it or leave it
[1:36:46] that's what brother brown said cain said
[1:36:49] best that i can do take it or leave it
[1:36:52] we know what god left it
[1:36:56] right
[1:36:57] but who where would that kind of an
[1:36:58] attitude come from
[1:37:02] you can't place it on adam
[1:37:08] you can't talk about it to abel
[1:37:12] right
[1:37:15] that's about the way man does today
[1:37:17] i helped build a church i send my
[1:37:20] children to church there i put money in
[1:37:23] there every year and that's the best i
[1:37:25] can do
[1:37:26] take it or leave it
[1:37:28] oh see
[1:37:30] he wants his own way that's the way cain
[1:37:33] did but god still loved him
[1:37:37] who's he talking about cain
[1:37:39] god still loved him
[1:37:41] and he still went after him
[1:37:46] what did god tell cain
[1:37:50] you'll do well
[1:37:51] if you'll just worship like your brother
[1:37:54] abel
[1:37:55] able come god's way but cain wanted his
[1:37:58] way
[1:37:58] and god said now cain
[1:38:01] i've got nothing against you
[1:38:05] you want to write these down and keep
[1:38:06] them
[1:38:08] if you'll just come over
[1:38:10] and go the way that abel goes
[1:38:14] you'll do well
[1:38:17] sounds like
[1:38:19] it could be saved
[1:38:23] god had nothing against him god loved
[1:38:25] him god went after him god offered it
[1:38:29] now if god offers you something
[1:38:31] you're the one turning it down remember
[1:38:33] that's all in for knowledge and
[1:38:34] predestination
[1:38:36] right look at the next one
[1:38:37] mark of the beast
[1:38:39] the seal of god or we should listen to
[1:38:40] this whole message
[1:38:50] pastor says you believe in god worship
[1:38:51] that's all you have to do go ahead and
[1:38:53] roll don't record i'm just saving time
[1:38:54] reading if that's right then cain was
[1:38:57] right but remember god said to cain
[1:39:00] worship like your brother and you'll do
[1:39:01] well but he didn't want to do it that's
[1:39:04] the way it is today they don't want to
[1:39:05] worship god in spirit and the truth they
[1:39:07] just want to go to church
[1:39:09] and worship the way the church says
[1:39:11] worship worship what god said worship
[1:39:16] but what are we doing
[1:39:18] that's the way it is today
[1:39:21] worship like your brother
[1:39:23] how
[1:39:25] shout and glory hallelujah wonderful
[1:39:27] no what is it all of that's part of it
[1:39:30] but what is worshiping in spirit and in
[1:39:32] truth
[1:39:35] there's got to be the word involved
[1:39:38] right
[1:39:39] so you can scout scream and holler and
[1:39:41] worship all you want to
[1:39:43] and be worshiping the devil
[1:39:46] brother brown said you can call him
[1:39:47] jesus jesus and worship the devil now i
[1:39:49] see his words
[1:39:52] but think about it just getting a little
[1:39:54] point across
[1:39:55] that was 1961 to
[1:39:59] 217 i guess yeah
[1:40:01] roll it on up because we're still in the
[1:40:02] same message
[1:40:06] the mark of the beast which is this is
[1:40:08] paragraph e70
[1:40:11] after it's brought right up to you and
[1:40:12] showed to you that the seed of
[1:40:15] that is the seed of god and just because
[1:40:17] of prestige you'd have to give up
[1:40:19] something or quit your denomination or
[1:40:21] something to receive it and then walk
[1:40:23] away from it you know what you'll do
[1:40:25] you'll seal yourself out of the kingdom
[1:40:28] mark of the beast
[1:40:31] when god told abel or told cain said
[1:40:33] just go over and worship like your
[1:40:35] brother
[1:40:38] bring a lamb come down here and worship
[1:40:41] like your brother
[1:40:42] said you'll do all right do as your
[1:40:44] brother does you'd be all right
[1:40:48] sound like he could be saved
[1:40:50] sounded like god was offering him an
[1:40:52] opportunity hey we know by
[1:40:55] studying the message that cain didn't
[1:40:57] receive it
[1:40:59] but my point is if god offers it to you
[1:41:06] you can receive it
[1:41:09] no you got to be this certain lineage
[1:41:11] now where's that at
[1:41:14] look at the next one
[1:41:18] an uncertain sound 1961-315
[1:41:21] and see god told cain he said go ahead
[1:41:24] and worship like your brother abel and
[1:41:26] you'll do well
[1:41:27] go ahead and do the way he's doing
[1:41:30] it'll be all right with you but he
[1:41:32] didn't sin lay at the door
[1:41:35] right
[1:41:37] come on
[1:41:39] look at the three kind of believers this
[1:41:41] is after the seals
[1:41:43] 11 24
[1:41:45] 63
[1:41:46] three kind of believers progress 165
[1:41:50] but abel knew that it wasn't that he uh
[1:41:53] was blood that took him out
[1:41:55] he knew that that was it
[1:41:57] it was the sex blood so he took a little
[1:42:00] animal and offered it upon a rock and
[1:42:02] chopped his neck notice cain he said god
[1:42:05] told him he said why don't you worship
[1:42:07] like your brother
[1:42:09] and you'll do all right
[1:42:11] you'll do well if you'll do that
[1:42:13] but no he know too much about it see he
[1:42:16] rejected the original a vindicated word
[1:42:20] if that ain't his children today
[1:42:25] worship lucky brother
[1:42:28] what is that number 20
[1:42:30] that's 20 come on okay 22.
[1:42:36] god's power transformation 65 911
[1:42:39] paragraph 183
[1:42:41] and if you want to find this
[1:42:43] i got a scripture here that's what i
[1:42:45] referring to here genesis 4 6 and 7. god
[1:42:48] said to cain said why
[1:42:50] are your countenance fallen
[1:42:52] why are you all full of temper
[1:42:55] walking around
[1:42:56] you just heard a message
[1:42:58] that upset you
[1:43:01] and come on
[1:43:04] said well what are you doing
[1:43:06] that far
[1:43:08] why are your countenance
[1:43:10] fail
[1:43:12] because i didn't come into your church
[1:43:15] so why did you do it
[1:43:18] are you using a thinking man's filter
[1:43:20] see
[1:43:21] or why didn't why you looking like that
[1:43:25] said
[1:43:25] if you'll do well
[1:43:27] go ahead do like your brother is doing
[1:43:30] out there
[1:43:31] i'll receive you
[1:43:33] and bless you
[1:43:38] right
[1:43:39] i'll do it for you the same thing
[1:43:42] but he just couldn't do it he said
[1:43:45] now if you don't
[1:43:47] if you don't sin of unbelief lies at the
[1:43:50] door he said i'll accept you
[1:43:55] see we're trying to make him some
[1:43:56] lineage
[1:43:57] and paul warned us he said get away from
[1:43:59] these endless genealogies
[1:44:04] right we see we got lineages the people
[1:44:06] of the message preaching lineages
[1:44:10] what are you going to do with when you
[1:44:11] come to the flood
[1:44:14] right
[1:44:16] what are you going to do with it when
[1:44:16] you get to the flood
[1:44:19] in the flood all you got is noah
[1:44:23] his sons and his
[1:44:25] wife and
[1:44:26] his daughter-in-laws
[1:44:29] what are you going to do with it
[1:44:34] we've got to have lineages
[1:44:36] then you come over to
[1:44:38] cain i mean come over to uh jacob
[1:44:42] and you got two brothers born
[1:44:44] he saw and jacob
[1:44:50] same mama same daddy
[1:44:54] look what one of them turned out to be
[1:44:55] look what the other one turned out to be
[1:45:01] but i always thought it was lineages
[1:45:02] brother dale
[1:45:04] well that's what you've got for thinking
[1:45:10] well i've always been taught that
[1:45:12] that's what you get for listening to
[1:45:14] people that's taught that
[1:45:18] right
[1:45:19] i'm talking about you
[1:45:21] me us in the message
[1:45:24] listening to people talk about things
[1:45:29] telling us cain couldn't be saved
[1:45:32] i gave you four or five quotes where
[1:45:33] brother branham says
[1:45:35] that he could
[1:45:37] if he'd only do like his brother what
[1:45:40] offer a blood atonement
[1:45:42] right it's in every one of them if you
[1:45:45] do like your brother your brother by
[1:45:47] spiritual revelation offered the blood
[1:45:51] you go off of the blood and i'll accept
[1:45:53] you
[1:45:54] is that what he said
[1:45:57] i'll receive you and bless you
[1:45:59] i'll do for you the same thing
[1:46:05] but you see
[1:46:06] what we've been taught is laying in us
[1:46:10] it's hard to
[1:46:12] destroy that thought
[1:46:16] like garner ted armstrong said one time
[1:46:18] he said
[1:46:19] you destroyed a man's doctrine and said
[1:46:20] you destroyed the man
[1:46:28] all right
[1:46:30] you take away from a baptist preacher
[1:46:32] the fact that he can dangle you over
[1:46:33] hell by scaring you to death about
[1:46:36] you're going to die and go to hell
[1:46:37] eternally
[1:46:39] if you don't get saved you take that
[1:46:41] away from me and got no message
[1:46:47] a lot of the preachers in this message
[1:46:48] ain't got a message except trying to
[1:46:50] show where brother ryan was wrong
[1:46:54] right
[1:46:59] but when are we going to do what brother
[1:47:00] brown said
[1:47:02] he said i'll be glad when it comes to
[1:47:03] the time that they'll do like they did
[1:47:05] in the days of paul look him straight in
[1:47:07] the eye and say you're not saying
[1:47:10] what paul said
[1:47:16] but brother dale i don't want to be
[1:47:18] hateful no i don't want to be hateful
[1:47:20] either but my soul is involved in this
[1:47:23] folks
[1:47:26] that's right
[1:47:28] we can argue petty things when we get in
[1:47:30] heaven
[1:47:31] ain't got time to argue now
[1:47:38] we get up to heaven you know there's
[1:47:39] going to be a lot of things to be talked
[1:47:40] about
[1:47:44] do you think luther's going to be
[1:47:45] sitting over in the corner
[1:47:47] well all the rest of them had everything
[1:47:49] good and straight but i didn't have it
[1:47:50] too straight no he had to just shall
[1:47:53] live by faith
[1:47:54] and you know what i'm going to say i'm
[1:47:56] going to say luther stand up and tell us
[1:47:58] about it
[1:47:59] tell us about that just shall live by
[1:48:01] faith
[1:48:03] abel tell us about the blood
[1:48:07] abraham tell me about that unconditional
[1:48:10] covenant
[1:48:12] david tell me about that singing they
[1:48:15] pierced my hands and my feet
[1:48:21] i think it'll be an embarrassing
[1:48:23] situation because something we was
[1:48:26] it's going to be wonderful for what we
[1:48:28] are
[1:48:32] somebody's got to get this thing
[1:48:34] personal
[1:48:38] instead of arguing doctrines we've got
[1:48:40] to become a reality
[1:48:42] i'm going to end it with this
[1:48:44] what happened in the garden
[1:48:46] brought death
[1:48:48] that's right
[1:48:49] now you show me that that ain't right
[1:48:51] you show me that ain't exactly what
[1:48:53] we've been covering because that's what
[1:48:55] cain went to
[1:48:59] you think brother dale
[1:49:02] you're just preaching this
[1:49:07] one of these days i'd like to get back
[1:49:09] to
[1:49:10] seal number one two three and four
[1:49:14] and i'd like to read and the lord said
[1:49:16] unto cain
[1:49:19] why is thy countenance fallen
[1:49:25] first seal was white horse rider the
[1:49:27] nicolaitan doctrine
[1:49:32] right
[1:49:33] nicolaitan doctrine brought the
[1:49:35] deception
[1:49:37] conquer the laity
[1:49:42] second seal
[1:49:44] and cain talked with abel his brother
[1:49:47] and it came to pass when they were in
[1:49:49] the seal
[1:49:50] he killed him
[1:49:54] first one's white
[1:49:55] second one's red
[1:49:58] right
[1:50:01] next one's black next one's
[1:50:03] pale
[1:50:07] first human murderer
[1:50:09] was cain
[1:50:12] that killed abel
[1:50:15] second seal
[1:50:17] third seal
[1:50:20] now thou art cursed
[1:50:23] from all the earth
[1:50:26] that received your brother's blood
[1:50:29] blackness came upon cain
[1:50:33] and that's your black horse
[1:50:37] blackness came upon cain and he killed
[1:50:39] abel
[1:50:42] that's your third seal
[1:50:46] for seal
[1:50:52] and cain went out from the presence of
[1:50:54] the lord
[1:50:57] the fourth seal is eternal separation
[1:51:01] the pale horse
[1:51:05] yeah i've been preaching this too long
[1:51:06] folks to want to be deceived about
[1:51:08] anything
[1:51:13] i want to go on with the lord
[1:51:16] don't you
[1:51:19] but i don't want to get caught by every
[1:51:21] little deception every little thought
[1:51:22] little ideas of mankind and silliness
[1:51:29] because i've been around too long in
[1:51:31] this message and i went around and
[1:51:32] listened to all these doctrines and none
[1:51:34] of them yet has produced a rapture
[1:51:39] brother brown said why hasn't all your
[1:51:41] reigns
[1:51:42] brought christ to the church
[1:51:47] they've had reigns two souls two lords
[1:51:49] seven thunder virtue perusia river
[1:51:51] jordans
[1:51:55] that all kind of reigns
[1:51:57] but why hadn't they brought christ
[1:52:01] no it's only brought arguments about
[1:52:02] doctrines and ideas
[1:52:06] instead of bringing christ on the scene
[1:52:08] into people's heart
[1:52:13] don't do his cane we'll get to it
[1:52:15] wednesday that went out of the presence
[1:52:17] of the lord
[1:52:19] god never drove him out
[1:52:22] he went out
[1:52:24] he went into death
[1:52:29] had he done what abel done
[1:52:31] offering the blood he would have been
[1:52:33] all right
[1:52:34] right
[1:52:35] and your prophets the one that said that
[1:52:36] he would have been accepted
[1:52:39] but i've just been taught this so much
[1:52:41] brother dale i think it's about time to
[1:52:44] lay down some of the things that was
[1:52:46] taught i was taught all my life that
[1:52:49] there was one god but it was god in
[1:52:51] three persons blessed trinity
[1:52:56] good old baptist deacon standing up
[1:52:58] teaching the duck sunday school classes
[1:53:02] saw the truth and walked out
[1:53:06] what about you
[1:53:09] you see i found out the lord wasn't in
[1:53:11] that church
[1:53:13] he was outside calling me
[1:53:19] right before i left there
[1:53:22] tell you a little story
[1:53:26] right before i left that church
[1:53:28] i used to go up every sunday and turn on
[1:53:30] everything get there early just like i
[1:53:31] do here it's always been my
[1:53:33] this i don't bother me to come turn

[1:53:36] close it up that that's just me i've
[1:53:38] always been there
[1:53:40] i go up to the church and the doors were
[1:53:42] locked
[1:53:44] we always had a way of unlocking them
[1:53:46] without having to turn a key you could
[1:53:47] just stick a knife in push a little
[1:53:48] plunger on the front door
[1:53:50] and you could just walk on in you know
[1:53:53] i had to keep right now too i just doors
[1:53:55] locked
[1:53:56] everything was locked up and i walked in
[1:53:58] turning on everything getting ready
[1:54:02] i went down the basement
[1:54:06] there's a man walking around in there

[1:54:14] he said heidi
[1:54:15] how you doing he said i'm doing fine
[1:54:18] he said i was just on my way up down
[1:54:20] through here and i thought i'd stop by

[1:54:25] have church in a little while if you
[1:54:26] want to hang around

[1:54:32] wonderful
[1:54:34] he said no i said i got to go on
[1:54:38] he said i'm just going on up the road
[1:54:41] i said okay remember in a church that
[1:54:43] was locked up
[1:54:47] i walk him to the front door of the
[1:54:48] church he goes out
[1:54:51] last time i seen him he was on the
[1:54:52] highway
[1:54:55] heading towards gainesville
[1:55:00] well when we left out of that church
[1:55:04] we went out of that door
[1:55:06] and we went to gainesville
[1:55:10] following that man
[1:55:15] i'm still following him
[1:55:21] you see church
[1:55:23] i don't tell everything because
[1:55:26] people get built on some kind of a thing
[1:55:31] but god has been with this church right
[1:55:33] here to bring us through some of the
[1:55:34] most horrible things and situations and
[1:55:37] problems it's ever been
[1:55:39] and we come out of it just being the
[1:55:40] same
[1:55:42] loving everybody
[1:55:44] he never had no feelings against nobody
[1:55:46] i get hurt feelings come on i'm human
[1:55:51] but i put them in the ceiling of my
[1:55:52] britches and i sit down on them
[1:55:55] and i still love everybody
[1:55:59] whether you agree with me or what you do
[1:56:01] i love you
[1:56:05] i just want god among us
[1:56:10] to live among us and work among us
[1:56:14] but the last thing i always pray is god
[1:56:17] give us the word
[1:56:20] no matter if this man
[1:56:23] has to be a castaway
[1:56:28] you mean you would paul said he would be
[1:56:30] a castaway for his people you're trying
[1:56:32] to make yourself like a paul huh no i'm
[1:56:34] just being myself
[1:56:36] that's the way i feel
[1:56:39] and why don't you feel that
[1:56:40] way right

[1:56:56] night and going into it
[1:57:01] like what was the mark that was put on
[1:57:02] cane
[1:57:07] what was the mark that was put on cane

[1:57:17] was eternal life in the soul of adam
[1:57:21] and then turned around on the breach in
[1:57:23] the seal book and say
[1:57:25] adam
[1:57:26] fell from eternal life
[1:57:29] to death in the
[1:57:36] garden there's always an answer
[1:57:40] if we know by revelation right
[1:57:43] you able knew it was blood they had no
[1:57:45] problem
[1:57:47] cain thought because of his mama's
[1:57:49] doctrine
