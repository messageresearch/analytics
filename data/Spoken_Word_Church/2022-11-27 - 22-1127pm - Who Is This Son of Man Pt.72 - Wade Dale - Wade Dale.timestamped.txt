[4:45] Holy Ghost to give us that Lord that
[4:47] we're not like the world the world's

[5:16] just cover him Lord and calm him down
[5:18] and let him rest Lord so his body can
[5:20] heal and Lord let him rest so that
[5:22] Sister Janet and the different ones that
[5:23] the family can rest too Lord we pray
[5:26] that we know there's always a family
[5:27] involved in any of these requests and we
[5:29] pray for that family too Lord all the
[5:31] ones that are going through all the
[5:32] different things Lord we pray that you
[5:34] just be with them be with sister Julie
[5:36] and all the ones on the prayer list
[5:37] father we pray that you'd bless them
[5:39] Lord be with the foreign Mission Fields
[5:41] Lord be with the ones that are that are
[5:43] laboring Lord to bring home Souls we
[5:46] pray that you'd be with them Father
[5:47] forgive us of our sins and bless us in
[5:49] Jesus name
[5:51] Amen in the beginning was the word and
[5:53] the Word was with God and the Word was
[5:55] God and the Word was made flesh and
[5:56] dwelt among us and we beheld his glory
[5:58] the glory of the only begotten of the
[6:00] father full of grace and truth now
[6:03] that's what we got to get to the son of
[6:05] man the word was made flesh brother
[6:08] Brown said the word becoming flesh the
[6:10] flesh becoming word so that's what we're
[6:12] trying to get it back together it got
[6:14] separated in the garden there was enmity
[6:17] there was a division between God and man
[6:19] and it became the carnal mind because
[6:21] the Bible says carnal mind is enmity to
[6:23] God so what we're trying to do is is
[6:25] what transform by the renewing of your
[6:27] mind take that carnal mind out and put
[6:30] the mind of God in all right so let's
[6:32] read Luke 6 verse 19 as we'll get to
[6:35] this one I hope we get to this one
[6:38] virtue called virtue and the whole
[6:41] multitude sought to touch him for there
[6:44] went virtue out of him and healed them
[6:47] all you may be seated the Lord that is
[6:49] blessing to the read the word Virtue
[6:52] went out of him to heal them all what a
[6:56] power you know you you talk you watch
[6:59] brother Bri's meetings and I know in
[7:00] Jesus's meetings there was no way that
[7:03] you could record everything because even
[7:04] John right at the end of John The Book
[7:07] of John John says there's no volume that
[7:09] could write what happened during the
[7:11] time of Jesus we just got a little
[7:13] snippet of it or a little or a little
[7:16] highlight of those three and a half
[7:17] years of Jesus's Ministry we just got a
[7:19] highlight but we know that there was
[7:21] more done than what was written in the
[7:23] book the same way now but see we had now
[7:25] a prophet in the end time that they
[7:27] could record I like what said the first
[7:30] time in
[7:31] 1947 he's he said they're trying some
[7:33] one of these new things or this new
[7:36] thing is being and it was a wire
[7:38] recording they started recording and and
[7:41] you know what that developed I'm sorry
[7:42] but it developed in the war in 1945 and
[7:45] a different ones before that World War I
[7:47] communication through the airwaves well
[7:50] you know what that was that was for me
[7:52] and
[7:53] you that was so that the prophet could
[7:55] stand here and they could record his
[7:57] 1100 and something sermons from 1947 to
[8:01] 1965 just for me and you so that we
[8:04] could hear and be the voice hear the
[8:07] voice of the seventh angel and then
[8:09] become that voice all right so virtue
[8:12] went out of him and healed them all so
[8:14] we know that brother ROM in thousands
[8:16] upon thousands upon thousands you would
[8:18] watch him in that one that we got the
[8:21] 20th century Prophet 1950 and he always
[8:24] told us but you can really see it you
[8:26] can see how that that that whatever the
[8:28] people are pulling out of him The Virtue
[8:30] that they're pulling out of him it just
[8:32] drains him dry he never can get through
[8:34] a whole prayer line because why the
[8:36] people are pulling it out of him they're
[8:39] pulling the virtue or the strength from
[8:41] brother brandham and he would always
[8:43] comment on he said he said if Jesus was
[8:46] that way and said who touched me and you
[8:48] know he become weak and all that he said
[8:50] what about me a sinner saved by grace he
[8:52] said what about it happening to me and
[8:54] it did and it happens to all of us if
[8:56] you've ever prayed for somebody and
[8:58] really the spirit of God fall on you you
[9:00] you just you have a weak moment you
[9:03] recover from it but you have a weak
[9:05] moment and you know then brother rown
[9:06] tells us that a sermon about an eight
[9:08] hour worth of work so so you are pretty
[9:10] tired now I always wondered how how that
[9:13] Dad could do it and of course his body's
[9:15] wearing out now bless his heart but but
[9:18] back then he was working 40 and 48 hours
[9:21] a week in a regular job at General
[9:23] Motors didn't have air conditioning none
[9:25] of that stuff he yet didn't um he did
[9:28] Manual Labor
[9:29] and still would come and preach two
[9:31] sermons and then Wednesday night too he
[9:32] never did have any help I mean he'd
[9:34] preach two three months without having a
[9:36] vis and preacher and and U but but your
[9:39] body it does wear your body out but I
[9:42] pray that he gives us he get all of us
[9:44] gives us all Supernatural strength to be
[9:47] able to what make it and we're going to
[9:48] make it somebody is going to make it to
[9:51] that very end and I just believe it's us
[9:54] I just believe it's going to be me and
[9:56] you I believe that we have enough of the
[9:58] power of of God now if brother Brown
[10:00] said we could create a world and go live
[10:02] on it but there's a bar holding us there
[10:05] why we can't do that because of our
[10:07] Humanity at the moment but that humanity
[10:09] is fixing to break folks and when it
[10:10] does we're going out of here and we're
[10:13] taking all the dead Saints with us that
[10:14] all from all down through into Paul's
[10:17] age we're bringing them up and we're all
[10:18] going to March into Glory together all
[10:20] right we're going into another dimension
[10:23] and it's not even going to be glory we
[10:25] talk about going to glory and going to
[10:26] heaven that's for a long way from now
[10:30] everybody with me we got to go through
[10:32] what marriage supper we got to go
[10:35] through a thousand years of of
[10:37] Millennium and then we get to go to the
[10:39] Future home which is the streets of gold
[10:41] which is the Heavenly Gates which is the
[10:42] one we're looking for which is our city
[10:45] and that would be the future home so
[10:47] it's way down the road but boy what we
[10:49] got to start now we got to start now we
[10:51] got to start building it now in this
[10:53] Dimension and you say well we can't do
[10:55] it God listen if God put you in this
[10:57] Dimension and he put put a word in this
[10:59] Dimension he put everything in this
[11:01] dimension for us to get it to the next
[11:02] Dimension something's going to it's
[11:04] going to happen that's right amen we've
[11:06] just got to have enough what strength or
[11:08] virtue you say well I'm just a housewife
[11:10] well I'm just this brother bham even
[11:12] makes it as adoption being a man putting
[11:14] his lunch under his under his under his
[11:16] well of course then they some of y'all
[11:18] that are younger don't remember that but
[11:20] they used to have what was the what was
[11:22] the name of the the wasn't Igloo what
[11:25] was the name of the ther
[11:27] thermos hello
[11:29] it was called but it was a thermos and
[11:31] and you put everything you put soup in
[11:32] it or you put your coffee in it and it
[11:35] would go in a a box that weighed 55 lbs
[11:38] cuz back then it wasn't no such thing as
[11:42] plastic I tell you what I wish I had I
[11:44] wished I had I saw the other day just
[11:46] for your enjoyment before you go to
[11:48] sleep um is mom bought us a in 1960
[11:53] probably five or six when we first
[11:55] started school or I first started school
[11:57] she bought me a Batman in
[12:02] lunchbox probably paid about $1.50 for
[12:05] it do you know how much them things sell
[12:06] on aay eBay now four and
[12:09] $500 if you got an original one and we
[12:12] just throw that thing everywhere a lot
[12:13] of stuff we had back then cuz we're
[12:15] considered
[12:17] old amen thank you and it had a mini
[12:20] thermos in it but that's what brother R
[12:21] was talking about but when you listen to
[12:23] the kids really when you listen a
[12:25] lunchbox under his arm going to work
[12:27] that literally happened
[12:29] or you'd have your little tote you know
[12:31] with the thermos on top and and and you
[12:33] open it up and you had sand listen
[12:35] wasn't many McDonald's back then what in
[12:37] a what in a convenience store on every
[12:39] corner come on now you got what you got
[12:41] at home if your wife didn't make it you
[12:44] didn't get it but brother M talks about
[12:47] that and it's so simple as being coming
[12:49] to adoption it's knowing where you're at
[12:50] knowing your place and when you do go to
[12:52] work there's virtue that goes to work
[12:54] with you and people can say hey can you
[12:57] pray for me hey when you go to church
[12:59] even though they may not ever go to
[13:01] church the day in their life they know
[13:02] you do and they can say hey will you
[13:05] pray for me will you pray for so how
[13:08] many prayer requests do we get from
[13:09] people that don't even come to church
[13:10] here almost about half right why is that
[13:16] it's not because they think you're a
[13:17] drunk it's not because they think you're
[13:20] a pill what we all call Pill Popper back
[13:22] when we coming up uh-uh no they think
[13:25] you they know you've got some strength
[13:27] or at least you got a good connection
[13:29] you know I knew dad had a good
[13:32] connection with God and if I ever got in
[13:34] trouble that's exactly where I went and
[13:35] finally one day I couldn't find him and
[13:37] I had to go to the heavenly
[13:39] father hello
[13:40] somebody you got to get to your heavenly
[13:43] father first your Earthly father would
[13:45] do anything in the world take a bullet
[13:46] for you have his head chopped off for
[13:48] you but he can't save your soul but your
[13:51] heavenly father can so that's the one
[13:53] you need to cry out to as your heavenly
[13:54] father but it gives us enough virtue to
[13:57] where people can look that that even we
[13:59] were talking about this in Jude this
[14:00] morning about that we should what
[14:03] earnestly contend for the faith which
[14:04] was once delivered to the Saints so what
[14:06] we've got to do is is when we're here
[14:08] looking at the Statue of perfect man we
[14:10] do have to now it's not bad it is bad to
[14:12] look back for certain way but it's not
[14:14] bad to look back to the first church age
[14:16] because it tells you it tells you to do
[14:18] that you must earnestly contend contend
[14:20] for the faithful which was once
[14:21] delivered to the Saints so we what we go
[14:24] to the book of Acts maybe next Sunday or
[14:27] so we'll go to the book of Acts and see
[14:29] what they acted like that's why it's
[14:31] called the book of Acts because it's the
[14:34] acts of the Holy Ghost in the people so
[14:36] if the Holy Ghost is the same and they
[14:39] had the virtues working in their life
[14:41] all we got to do is read the book of
[14:42] Acts and there's our part there's our
[14:45] place to read and that's our place to
[14:47] get something that is the faith that was
[14:50] once delivered unto the Saints which now
[14:53] is and do you know why it works better
[14:55] there I say
[14:57] better they had no denominational idea
[15:01] they had these virtues working in their
[15:04] life all right so they had these virtues
[15:06] working in their life so they got
[15:07] something
[15:10] amen 100% of the New Testament was
[15:13] written back there under that that Faith
[15:19] anointing all the old test New Testament
[15:22] was written right there right from the
[15:25] book of Acts on up Luke Paul different
[15:29] ones you look at your books now we know
[15:30] Matthew and them were written about
[15:32] Jesus but remember all those four
[15:34] gospels were written after Jesus died or
[15:36] after he ascended right so you're
[15:38] looking back to that faith that was once
[15:40] delivered to the Saints and even they
[15:43] told Brother Ram one time they said Oh
[15:44] Brother R you can write 23rd chapter of
[15:47] Revelations he said that sounded good he
[15:50] said but it he said it's false you can't
[15:52] add to the word God's written everything
[15:54] he's going to write and that's all he's
[15:55] going to write he's not going to write
[15:56] anymore that's why brother Bri I said
[15:58] brother around didn't bring any new
[15:59] revelation or new doctrine it was the
[16:02] doctrines that was already in the Bible
[16:03] what had happened man had went and put
[16:05] their own interpretation to it there was
[16:08] no virtue left in some of those things
[16:11] God's not going to honor a false
[16:12] Doctrine so what virtue can you get out
[16:14] of a false Doctrine now he listen he did
[16:17] wink at their
[16:19] ignorance he did let them and allow them
[16:21] to be baptized in the name of Father Son
[16:23] and Holy Ghost cuz that's all they knew
[16:25] but not that first
[16:27] church not that first first church not
[16:30] the first church they didn't believe in
[16:31] eternal hell they didn't believe in all
[16:33] these dogmas and doctrines that came
[16:35] from NAA from 300 years after Jesus went
[16:37] off the scene until 600 and those those
[16:40] doctrines were established and they're
[16:42] still
[16:44] there it's just it's just pitiful to see
[16:48] that that the denominational world looks
[16:50] at the mother and and know she's
[16:53] the they know Rome's the but
[16:56] they don't read that she had daughters
[16:58] she's got daughters that drink of the
[17:01] same cup that she drinks
[17:04] of that's how it's so close to the
[17:08] deceive the very last so God had to send
[17:09] us a prophet to pull us out from under
[17:11] that come out of her my people all right
[17:14] come out of those ideas and those
[17:17] doctrines those trinitarian ideas which
[17:19] brother R said came from the pits of
[17:21] Hell any false Doctrine you can have
[17:23] somebody come up here and preach their
[17:24] heart out and if it's a false Doctrine
[17:26] it did not come from God right it came
[17:29] from hell it came from a demon that got
[17:32] a hold of you now not saying nothing
[17:33] about the brother or
[17:35] sister you can get a demon on you and be
[17:38] born again come on somebody if you don't
[17:40] believe that you got one on you
[17:44] now got you quiet there didn't
[17:47] I but anything contrary to the word of
[17:50] God is a devil and it's
[17:52] false all right but God winked at their
[17:55] ignorance he winked at man pushing their
[17:59] Doctrine but he said I'm going to have a
[18:01] people in the end time that's going to
[18:05] what Malachi 4 restore the hearts of the
[18:09] fathers to the children and the children
[18:11] to the fathers so he took the what
[18:13] Babylon Pentecostal babies and brought
[18:15] the faith of the fathers back which was
[18:18] what uh Matthew Mark Luke John um Paul
[18:23] irenius all those all those ones back
[18:25] there that didn't have doctrinal issues
[18:28] boy would be nice wouldn't it Bob it'd
[18:30] be nice to be back there and be the
[18:32] first church age and you go to
[18:33] somebody's church and you preach and
[18:34] they're all you know amen and then you
[18:36] go to the next church and it's all amen
[18:38] you go to the next church it's all amen
[18:40] now you can go to a church and you
[18:41] preach a little Doctrine a little
[18:43] something extra and you won't get old
[18:44] man you'll get a right foot of
[18:47] Fellowship out the
[18:49] door but that didn't happen in the first
[18:51] church age why did it happen it happened
[18:54] because they got an
[18:57] idea so Corinthians got an idea during
[19:00] irenius his time that what that Jesus
[19:02] wasn't exactly
[19:04] God all right Bob's read it many
[19:08] times where serenus would say well he's
[19:10] kind of a like substance of God well see
[19:12] that was a seed in irenius is day but if
[19:15] you'll look in irenius his day you come
[19:18] up to 300 that thing just went right
[19:20] over into
[19:22] NAA serenus may have never been to NAA
[19:26] he may have died before that happened
[19:27] but remember demons don't die they just
[19:29] go right over into somebody else which
[19:32] goes right over into somebody else which
[19:34] went right over to NAA and what Satan
[19:36] loves numbers he gathered them all
[19:38] together and said this is what we're
[19:39] going to do all right I don't know how I
[19:42] got off on that but that's okay but
[19:44] that's what we got to be restored back
[19:45] to though that
[19:47] Faith because there's no virtue in
[19:50] father son Holy Ghost come on people
[19:52] there's no virtue in
[19:54] that there's no virtue in a false
[19:56] Doctrine can't be so to to to begin with
[19:59] right here at to get-go The Virtue that
[20:01] we have to have has to be proven
[20:04] word-based virtue not
[20:08] word sometimes word-based virtue it's
[20:11] got to be word-based virtue to get the
[20:14] dunamus dunamus is Holy Ghost holy ghost
[20:17] power that's what we're looking at here
[20:19] I want us to get this right here down
[20:22] pat amen then when we get this Pat we're
[20:25] going to have a church that's got
[20:27] adopted Sons and Daughters of
[20:30] God we're not going to be what we're not
[20:32] going to be immune from everything but I
[20:34] promise you we'll know more how to
[20:36] handle it we'll know more how to what
[20:39] defeat the Devil right that's what I'm
[20:42] looking for you can look for that if you
[20:43] want to that's why I wanted people
[20:45] baptized I want people with the Holy
[20:47] Ghost I want us to have prayer meetings
[20:48] I want us to have things to where we can
[20:50] get people involved in God not involved
[20:52] in a
[20:53] church amen involved in God and God will
[20:58] drive you here you get involved with God
[21:00] he'll put you here amen everybody all
[21:03] right with
[21:06] that greatest battle ever fought I
[21:08] believe the greatest battle that ever
[21:09] fought is now ready to go into action I
[21:12] believe that God has been selecting his
[21:14] soldiers and he's been dressing them
[21:16] training them the Battlefront is now set
[21:19] getting ready to start getting ready to
[21:20] start
[21:22] 1962 because the greatest battle because
[21:25] look let me put it this way
[21:28] brother Brandon was
[21:30] preaching in a in a time frame hear me
[21:34] out just a second he he was preaching in
[21:36] a time frame or a dispensation now he
[21:39] believed in dispensations right he was
[21:42] trying to take those old Pentecost which
[21:45] were babbling babies all they thought
[21:46] about was speaking in tongues and and
[21:48] carrying on in church and he was trying
[21:50] to feed them the word he was trying to
[21:52] bring them over and bring them into what
[21:55] the word of God pure
[21:58] adulterated everybody with me but they
[22:01] wanted to either stay there or bring
[22:04] their ideas with
[22:05] them all right cuz he was preaching when
[22:08] he preached he didn't preach the message
[22:09] Believers
[22:11] folks most people didn't want to even
[22:14] see his message they wanted to see the
[22:16] signs and wonders
[22:19] afterwards I'm just telling you what
[22:20] some said has been in the
[22:23] meeting wanted him to hurry up and get
[22:25] finished with the message so he could
[22:26] what that was the open Pentecostal
[22:29] way I got to see some signs and wonders
[22:32] but see because when brother R then
[22:33] though when he did go back and pick up
[22:35] that faith and pick up that message and
[22:38] start bringing it that's when he said
[22:41] himself he said hundreds will leave me
[22:43] thousands will leave me preach marriage
[22:45] and divorce he said my friends are going
[22:47] to leave me by droves in other words
[22:49] hundreds of people are going to and they
[22:51] did from preaching to 50,000 to
[22:54] preaching to 25 or 30 in a trailer out
[22:57] in Arizona
[22:58] and preach some good messages too preach
[23:00] the M Rapture message out
[23:02] there but God's going to get the message
[23:05] out they're not going to hinder it man's
[23:08] not going to hinder it the devil's not
[23:10] going to hinder it and me and you are
[23:11] not going to hinder it we can sit there
[23:13] s push face all we want to God is going
[23:16] to move on all right and you know what
[23:19] if we don't move with
[23:22] him as they say in the movies
[23:26] say because it's your choice we go back
[23:29] to your choice to follow him or not all
[23:33] right but this thing's got to be
[23:35] quickened inside of our heart that's why
[23:36] I wanted to lay that
[23:38] foundation for for months now trying to
[23:41] get us right there equipped for this
[23:43] battle because it's a going to be a
[23:46] battle it has already begun in most of
[23:48] our Lives it is a battle I know it's a
[23:52] battle to get to church I know it's a
[23:54] battle to do things for God you know why
[23:57] cuz it's a battle for me
[24:00] me but you know his old man said one
[24:03] time he said
[24:05] well he said I
[24:07] uh I stayed out kind of late Saturday
[24:10] night at doing whatever going to ball
[24:12] game or something you know he said well
[24:15] well you know I I prayed and and and I
[24:17] think I'll just come you know I'll just
[24:20] skip this
[24:22] weekend and and and uh and I'll just uh
[24:28] I don't think the Lord will bother that
[24:30] you know like
[24:33] no go back to the will of God the will
[24:37] of God is the word of
[24:39] God now I want to ask you a
[24:42] question whatever you do in your life
[24:45] outside of here is your business well
[24:47] not exactly but if you get doing wrong
[24:50] stuff it is going to be our business
[24:52] okay if we start hearing back but you
[24:54] understand what I'm saying if you like
[24:55] to do I like to hunt
[24:58] so I'm not going to squish you if you
[25:00] don't hunt and you don't squish me if I
[25:02] do but I'll promise you one thing if I
[25:04] was a
[25:05] Hunter and I got out on Saturday night
[25:08] and I C hunted till 3:00 in the morning
[25:10] that's no excuse for me not to be in
[25:12] church on Sunday right right I have made
[25:15] my own
[25:16] excuse yeah but I was with Brothers well
[25:21] they that you don't ever sin
[25:24] alone but you you understand what I'm
[25:26] saying so the same thing with with what
[25:28] we do as as Christians we we we should
[25:31] prepare oursel for God
[25:34] first all right we should make sure on
[25:36] Saturday night that our car is full of
[25:40] gas I'll promise you if you're going to
[25:42] the doctor tomorrow morning you're going
[25:44] to stop by before you go home and make
[25:46] sure you got enough gas in your car and
[25:48] everybody's shaking their head I see you
[25:50] yeah because you know that you're not
[25:52] going to get
[25:54] up you're not going to get up in time to
[25:57] go anyway
[25:58] but so to get the gas so you're going to
[26:00] get it tonight well same way with with
[26:02] church what you saying this is what I'm
[26:04] talking about virtue virtue is strength
[26:06] strength is what we get from the things
[26:08] we
[26:10] do I've got to believe though Michael
[26:14] I've got to believe though that when I
[26:15] do those things I do make sure that I
[26:18] prepared I do make sure that I maybe get
[26:20] a good night's rest somebody sometimes
[26:22] you always don't get a good I rest on
[26:23] Saturday night okay but you at least
[26:26] you're not going to be out with 3:00 in
[26:28] the morning you know hunting
[26:29] whatever you're doing and then you're
[26:31] going to sleep halfway through through
[26:34] church that's right that's
[26:38] virtue you decide what virtue
[26:42] is because you put the strength in
[26:45] it think about this with me for a minute
[26:48] you put the strength in
[26:51] it when I was a sinner I put my strength
[26:55] and my virtue in ball games
[26:58] and then whatever something in the
[26:59] sports realm or something hunting or and
[27:02] I used to hunt I'd hunt on Saturday hunt
[27:04] on Sunday so I didn't have to come to
[27:05] church I'm just being honest I'd do
[27:08] things on Sunday I'd schedule things on
[27:10] Sunday so my mama wouldn't have to call
[27:12] and say you come to church tomorrow oh
[27:14] Mom I'm going to be hunting I'm sorry
[27:16] about that but see that's but I I drew
[27:19] strength from that that thing that it
[27:21] was inside of me was drawing strength
[27:22] from that now I'm not saying it was
[27:25] good but now that I believe I've got God
[27:28] inside of me that virtue now is all that
[27:31] is totally secondary this is first so
[27:34] The Virtue and strength I've taken from
[27:36] out there I put here
[27:40] yes and that to me that's the most
[27:42] simple thing but it's the hardest thing
[27:44] we can ever
[27:45] do is put your trust in something you
[27:48] can't
[27:50] see something that's so powerful but you
[27:52] know what that woman did we're reading
[27:54] in just a little while you know the
[27:55] story she saw Jesus
[27:59] she
[28:01] never probably went to a
[28:05] sermon but she
[28:08] heard that he had
[28:10] strength she heard maybe two days ago
[28:13] she had been to the gate and there was a
[28:17] blind man called
[28:19] barnas and man she saw him walking
[28:21] around the temple not
[28:24] blind so she put strength in that
[28:28] and somebody
[28:30] says Jesus is going to come through this
[28:32] way Sunday morning at 10: and at
[28:35] 2: Wednesday night at 7:00 we know where
[28:38] God's going to
[28:42] be so what did she do she didn't go to
[28:47] Walmart she didn't schedule her a trip
[28:49] somewhere
[28:50] else she made sure she was right there
[28:55] and when she when he walked by there was
[28:58] so many people but like I said before
[29:00] she was unclean there was nothing that
[29:02] she could sit on that was clean she was
[29:04] unclean and they just got out of her way
[29:07] cuz she was an unclean woman had been
[29:08] for 12 years so they knew who she was
[29:11] and she just crawled right up there and
[29:13] all she done was just touch the
[29:17] Garment and what did Jesus say who
[29:19] touched
[29:22] me wow somebody quit for the battle you
[29:26] said well we're not Jesus you got that
[29:28] same
[29:29] guy that same guy that got
[29:33] weak come on somebody is inside of you
[29:37] today not another person not a lesser
[29:39] person that same person is inside of you
[29:42] in your human flesh that was God in
[29:45] human flesh and when she touched the
[29:47] Garment she was healed that's why when
[29:50] they went to the gate beautiful and then
[29:52] they they were um they took uh cloths
[29:55] off of Paul and put them on people that
[29:58] was virtue that was that was Paul the
[30:01] Apostle we've seen the healing we've
[30:04] seen these why brother BR that's why he
[30:06] could stand and make this statement that
[30:08] I've been telling you forever and ever
[30:10] the right mental
[30:12] attitude toward any promise of God will
[30:15] bring it to
[30:18] pass Peter said look on us don't look
[30:22] over there don't look down at you in
[30:24] other words he said don't look down at
[30:25] your situation don't look down and see
[30:28] all the world and what they're laughing
[30:30] and and you know we're we're they're
[30:32] hunting us anyway you know they want to
[30:34] lock us up everywhere they went they
[30:35] want to lock them up right don't look
[30:39] anywhere else he said look at
[30:42] us and then the guy you know what the
[30:45] guy did what they said and when he
[30:47] looked on them guess what he got
[30:50] healed and virtue had went out of them
[30:52] and it never said that he touched
[30:56] them right Silver and Gold Have I None
[30:59] now remember they did pick him up and
[31:00] help him get his strength back but there
[31:03] were certain times when you don't listen
[31:05] you don't have to
[31:07] touch that's right you touch the feeling
[31:09] of your infirmities God does that what
[31:14] supernaturally where they don't have to
[31:15] be a connection that's why we can pray
[31:17] for brother how 20 mil or 15 miles from
[31:19] here and know that God's going to that
[31:22] situation all
[31:24] right and and like I said before one
[31:26] more time sister Janet she didn't she
[31:28] didn't call the local convenience
[31:31] store hey pray for my dad why there was
[31:34] no virtue now there's virtue to the
[31:39] drunk he wants to go to that convenience
[31:41] store he knows he's going to get his
[31:43] strength from that convenience store
[31:44] he's going to buy him a lottery ticket
[31:46] smoke him a vape and buy him some booze
[31:49] that's his
[31:50] strength no Sister Janet sent a text she
[31:53] said could y'all have a special prayer
[31:55] so guess what the virtue and strength
[31:56] that we have went to
[31:59] that and we're going to expect that it
[32:01] does what it's supposed to do amen so
[32:04] God has equipped this then for the
[32:07] battle here's
[32:10] Paul for though we walk in the flesh we
[32:13] do not war after the flesh for the
[32:15] weapons of our Warfare are not carnal
[32:17] But Mighty through God to the pulling
[32:19] down of
[32:20] strongholds you know I was thinking the
[32:22] other
[32:25] day what an eort you know it it takes us
[32:28] an effort to get to church is what I
[32:30] just saying all right and we're whole
[32:31] and we're we've got good cars and we've
[32:34] got U full stomachs and and we come in
[32:37] here and Michael got some nice Cut suits
[32:40] on and uh who said uh-huh yeahuh you
[32:43] notice that
[32:47] too it'll get you somewhere but we see
[32:50] all that but but think about somebody
[32:53] that just has to believe somebody in a
[32:55] foreign country who can't do that who
[32:57] can't get in a
[32:58] car who has to walk to church for 10
[33:02] miles are those people to get in brother
[33:04] Brown's meetings are the people to get
[33:06] in Jesus's meeting them two friends
[33:09] really love that
[33:11] guy they tore a roof off of a
[33:16] house and dropped that man right down in
[33:19] front of Jesus two friends did it cuz he
[33:22] couldn't do
[33:23] it wow have we ever done that before to
[33:26] get somebody to be healed or get
[33:28] somebody to come to church no if we
[33:30] can't get the door open sometimes we
[33:32] don't come can't get the air conditioner
[33:34] to work
[33:36] right I mean honestly how many of y'all
[33:38] would come to church if it was 95
[33:39] degrees in here all the time don't raise
[33:41] your hand I know some of you wouldn't
[33:44] casting down imagination and every High
[33:47] thing that exalted itself against the
[33:48] knowledge of God that's why brother ran
[33:51] he said the right mental attitude in
[33:52] other words folks y'all have done the
[33:54] right thing you have come to the right
[33:56] place you have come in ambulances you
[33:58] have come in stretchers people have had
[34:00] to brought you in here remember that one
[34:01] girl that she was bleeding so bad till
[34:03] he had to go out to the to the um car
[34:06] said she's bleeding to death but guess
[34:08] what that woman's Living Well she might
[34:10] be now but she was living back then why
[34:12] cuz she had she knew where the virtue
[34:14] was at she knew where that that pipeline
[34:16] was and that's what you and I in virtue
[34:19] we've got to not not
[34:22] see seen things it's
[34:25] unseen there's no way you could put
[34:28] Jesus out in a crowd and say oh that
[34:30] man's got virtue it had to be something
[34:33] Supernatural but what did they have to
[34:35] do and I'm going to read something to
[34:36] you in just a few minutes or maybe a
[34:37] little
[34:39] bit there had to be something known
[34:41] about him before
[34:42] that everybody with me
[34:45] amen there had to be something known
[34:48] beforehand because we're going to read
[34:50] here in the Book of Ruth where where
[34:52] Boaz says the whole Community knows thou
[34:56] art a virtuous one woman the whole
[34:59] Community wow knows th are a virtuous
[35:03] woman we'll read it in just a minute
[35:05] look and having Readiness to Revenge all
[35:08] Disobedience when your obedience is
[35:12] fulfilled like I said before it's an
[35:15] effort but wow what kind of a what are
[35:19] you going to
[35:22] get you're going to get eternal life but
[35:24] you're going to get you say well brother
[35:26] way you you're you're you're preaching
[35:28] the power of positive thinking I hope
[35:31] so if it's mixed with faith if it's
[35:34] mixed with the Holy Ghost you going to
[35:36] be a powerful Army you're going to be
[35:38] somebody
[35:40] undefeatable you going to be somebody
[35:42] like brother Brown says Satan don't even
[35:44] know what to do with you you know what I
[35:45] hope he gets the frustrated he don't
[35:47] know what to do with us I hope he I hope
[35:49] he gets so
[35:52] mad I do till he tries to do something
[35:56] to to the
[35:57] bride and God's going to
[36:00] say no not that group you make can get
[36:04] to that group but you're not getting to
[36:05] that
[36:07] group but you got to make sure you're in
[36:09] that group we can't just say we're
[36:13] bride no you got to fight on your hands
[36:16] that's right you got to fight to get
[36:18] here according as his divine power we
[36:20] read that this morning let's and besides
[36:22] this besides your new birth besides you
[36:25] um hollering and screaming at the at the
[36:27] altar for God to save your soul and he
[36:29] does and he fills you with the Holy
[36:31] Ghost he burns all that old part of you
[36:32] out you still got to add add to your
[36:37] faith I mean why did you come to church
[36:39] to get
[36:40] saved I know some may not have but well
[36:43] I
[36:44] did this is where strength is this is
[36:46] where the virtue is right
[36:49] here not somewhere else I know you can
[36:52] kneel down and at a convenience store
[36:54] and if somebody's got the Holy Ghost
[36:56] they can pray for you you but there
[36:57] ain't a whole lot of many well ain't
[36:59] many Holy Ghost fied people hangs around
[37:01] a convenience store all the time usually
[37:03] it's the other ghost people that hangs
[37:04] around the convenience store every once
[37:05] in a
[37:09] while but when we start talking about
[37:11] virtue You' got to know where it's at
[37:15] and then you got to know who's got it
[37:18] and you can draw from
[37:20] it we can draw virtue from the word of
[37:23] God but folks let me tell you
[37:24] something brother rown tell tells us he
[37:27] said the seed life comes through the
[37:30] body Paul oh I'm sorry Saul Saul had
[37:35] every one of these Old Testament books
[37:37] now not the new but you understand the
[37:39] whole Old Testament the Torah Paul was
[37:43] so versed in those he knew everything he
[37:45] said and according to the law
[37:49] blameless so why didn't God just save
[37:51] him on the road to
[37:53] Damascus nope he sent him into town amen
[37:57] he said you go find or in words you go
[38:00] sit there and I'm going to find somebody
[38:02] and nice I'm going to find somebody that
[38:05] a seed life is already quickened in his
[38:07] body he's already filled with the Holy
[38:09] Ghost to pray for you to get the Holy
[38:12] Ghost so that's why the seed life comes
[38:14] through the body as a body of Believers
[38:17] you have to go from one to the other to
[38:19] chain
[38:20] reaction everybody with me on that
[38:23] that's what Paul had to do he was versed
[38:25] he knew every one of these script you
[38:27] know this one more time you know this
[38:30] whole message up one side down the other
[38:31] if you can't live the life you're I'm
[38:35] sorry add to your faith virtue to Virtue
[38:38] knowledge and that add is Minister
[38:41] nourishment
[38:42] see you brother Bri talks about being a
[38:45] Christian and and then Jesus talks about
[38:47] the tears and all the different things
[38:49] you know about some of them you know
[38:51] they get put in Stony ground and some of
[38:52] them get in some kind of ground and some
[38:54] kind of the other ground some in good
[38:55] ground well well they grow up to a
[38:57] certain spot and then they can't make it
[38:58] any further and even the Bible says the
[39:00] cares of
[39:04] Life the cares of
[39:07] life and maybe sometimes our family gets
[39:11] in the
[39:14] way I hope somebody said oh yeah cuz
[39:17] everybody boy you start talking about
[39:18] people family and they
[39:23] go not my kids not my
[39:27] wife if your wife ain't in church and
[39:30] ain't full of the Holy Ghost she's
[39:32] lost kids
[39:35] either you either me either it's time to
[39:39] tell it like it
[39:42] is study to show thyself approved unto
[39:45] God a Workman that needeth not be
[39:47] ashamed I'm not ashamed to preach now I
[39:50] used to I used to think
[39:52] man I'd be ashamed if by certain
[39:54] preacher I'm not now I'm not
[39:57] some and and Daddy's watching in he
[40:00] knows sometimes I sit there and go
[40:04] man it's like brother Claude said he
[40:06] said I just knew there was heads going
[40:08] to be hitting the floor and I could hear
[40:10] them you know cutting your head
[40:14] off but don't be ashamed for that that's
[40:17] what we were given a place in here to do
[40:20] amen we were given a place in here to
[40:22] cut you and you never know it right
[40:26] until you look down and you're
[40:28] bleeding and then when you go outside
[40:30] you go oh okay that was me he was
[40:32] talking about right don't you have you
[40:35] ever done that before yes sir I have and
[40:37] you have
[40:38] too you get cut and it's like oh man oh
[40:42] that was
[40:43] me but that look that needeth not be
[40:47] ashamed I'm not ashamed of this gospel
[40:49] I'm not ashamed of the of the message of
[40:50] the hour I'm not ashamed to living this
[40:52] life that I'm living are you if you're
[40:55] ashamed to living a life if you're
[40:56] living
[40:58] then change that's right get in the word
[41:02] of God get born
[41:06] again a Workman that needeth not be
[41:09] ashamed look rightly dividing the word
[41:10] of Truth you say man you're not supposed
[41:12] to divide the word up no you're not but
[41:15] why does the bible tell us that it's a
[41:17] two-edged
[41:18] sword cutting a under what's it doing it
[41:20] cutting that little stuff
[41:22] off you know the other day when I was
[41:24] skinning my deer you know you you you
[41:26] get this great big glob of hair you're
[41:29] cutting your skin in the deer you got a
[41:31] big old knife when you get to debone in
[41:33] it you get a smaller knife because you
[41:34] got to work a lot more tedious to get
[41:36] all the bones out of it well you're
[41:38] still rightly dividing the deer it's
[41:39] just the deer you're and you're cutting
[41:41] it up in smaller pieces and that's what
[41:43] you and I a Workman that needeth not be
[41:46] ashamed rightly dividing the word of
[41:48] truth because
[41:50] listen sometimes the word will choke
[41:54] you sometimes the word word will choke
[41:57] you and you don't want to do that you
[42:00] don't want to choke people you don't
[42:01] want to as brother dick said you don't
[42:03] want to bruise fruit but sometimes you
[42:06] do but you want to rightly divide the
[42:08] word of Truth and say okay Lord I'm
[42:10] going to preach to this group of people
[42:11] today you divided in how it needs to be
[42:15] divided cuz I you know you go you go
[42:17] preach brother Bob different ones
[42:18] brother Luis and them they're getting
[42:19] ready to go overseas but they've never
[42:21] preached in these pull pits before but
[42:24] you want God to rightly divide
[42:26] even if it's in another language and
[42:28] they're a thousand miles away God can
[42:30] still be working on both ends I love
[42:33] that about God I love that about the
[42:34] Holy Ghost I love that about the way God
[42:37] operates that he'll absolutely send you
[42:40] somebody and and you'll swear that that
[42:42] Pastor has took him into the study and
[42:45] told him your whole life right see folks
[42:49] that's why I and you know some people
[42:51] when you do that to some that don't have
[42:53] that don't have the Holy Ghost or there
[42:55] are they real um soft Christians it
[42:58] hurts their feelings and they leave for
[42:59] a little while don't ever leave if
[43:02] you're a child of God it was a spanking
[43:05] you
[43:06] needed it was a spanking I
[43:09] needed and it hurt hurt my will
[43:14] feelings but it because I was a
[43:17] child my daddy corrected me because I
[43:20] was his
[43:21] child and boy y'all are real lucky you
[43:25] guys that are kids now because when I
[43:27] was growing up every parent was my mom
[43:29] and
[43:30] daddy hello somebody what n this you
[43:33] leave my little baby alone no my daddy
[43:35] said if he needs it tear him up I'll
[43:37] tear him up when he gets
[43:40] home and I'll promise you do y'all know
[43:43] anything about whipping in church I mean
[43:45] in in
[43:46] school oh some of the other on well the
[43:48] other ones
[43:49] don't if I got a whiping in
[43:52] school I got a whiping at
[43:55] home
[43:56] and if I didn't tell him course I think
[43:59] I only got one Terence him tell me about
[44:01] all of them and got a whole bunch
[44:03] so one I I got one too and Mr White he
[44:08] tore me up goodness gracious see I still
[44:10] remember that and I didn't do whatever
[44:12] that was that I got in trouble for but
[44:15] my brother bless his heart they wore him
[44:17] out so anyway he's watching in and he's
[44:20] laughing which is good maybe they need
[44:22] to laugh right now they're not feeling
[44:23] very
[44:24] well but that's the way it worked around
[44:27] my
[44:28] house I knew if I got a whipping
[44:30] somewhere else or if if I was at
[44:32] Granny's house granny boy you don't whip
[44:35] your grandkids that's for sure no it
[44:37] wasn't my granny my granny had a broom
[44:40] didn't she my granny had a broom and she
[44:42] knew how to use it at a long
[44:46] distance she's 88 years old she can't I
[44:49] mean she could get up pretty quick but
[44:50] she'd be sitting there and you'd be
[44:51] doing something you're like I can beat
[44:53] her out the
[44:54] door no you can't cuz here come the
[45:03] broom why am I telling you this I'm
[45:05] telling you these stories because I
[45:07] respected my granny because of the
[45:08] virtue that she had she wasn't going to
[45:10] let you get by with
[45:12] nonsense my dad and mom W going to let
[45:14] me get by with nonsense so how is our
[45:16] heavenly father going to let us get by
[45:17] with nonsense he's not he's going to
[45:19] whip us and he's going to whip us not
[45:21] going to beat us he's going to whip us
[45:22] with nail Scar and hands but you know
[45:24] what we can be a rebellious his child
[45:26] and just keep doing it over and over
[45:27] again or we can say hey I I'm done with
[45:31] that I don't think I'm going to do that
[45:33] anymore cuz it's the same result is that
[45:35] what what is it what's uh Insanity doing
[45:38] the same thing over and over expecting a
[45:40] different
[45:41] results some of us need to work on
[45:44] that I see
[45:46] me but these virtues look what moral
[45:49] Excellence it's going to listen this is
[45:51] going to make you a better person going
[45:53] up these stat this statue of perfect man
[45:55] and asking God not only in your
[45:57] Christian life but in your newly married
[46:00] life and and let me give this as a side
[46:03] note as a
[46:04] hashtag Lily didn't break his
[46:08] arm no he did that on his his own he was
[46:12] a little bit roofed and
[46:15] um so it's not they had a fight I told
[46:18] her I said listen when y'all have a
[46:19] fight when you're newly with you need to
[46:21] put the mark where nobody can see
[46:23] it right d not on your hand not where
[46:25] some Mak and you hold go oh my
[46:28] word so anyway it's going to make your
[46:30] life better listen how many times have
[46:33] you seen that I've seen people out in
[46:34] the world like brother R said that had
[46:36] some of these virtues that that were
[46:38] just rank Sinners I saw a man and a
[46:41] woman not too long ago in the paper that
[46:43] I'd known from years and years and years
[46:45] ago I think it was a picture of them
[46:46] together and they were I knew they
[46:48] weren't Christians but they just loved
[46:50] each other and they were like in their
[46:51] 80s and and he would help her and she'
[46:54] help him that's good
[46:57] but we're looking for a life past that
[47:00] we're look and we can draw virtue from
[47:01] that I can draw virtue my dad my
[47:04] father-in-law is a good businessman and
[47:06] I can draw virtue from some of the
[47:07] things that he tells me but now as far
[47:09] as being a Christian he's never been one
[47:11] so I'm not going to sit there and listen
[47:13] to him tell me about how to get saved
[47:15] why would you do that he don't even know
[47:18] how to do it
[47:19] himself but if somebody's got saved if
[47:21] somebody studied like brother Dale for
[47:23] 40 50 years listen to them
[47:26] they got something for
[47:29] you there's little there's little
[47:31] tidbits of things I'm just going to talk
[47:33] about life today there's just little
[47:35] tidbits of things even sister C and
[47:37] different one and and sister Trudy will
[47:39] throw out there and sometimes you don't
[47:41] understand them because they're way
[47:42] ahead of me in years too but but you go
[47:45] man wisdom
[47:50] wow right and that's where I want to go
[47:52] I call my hey I need some help amen call
[47:56] brother down I need some help call
[47:59] somebody with some wisdom I need some
[48:01] help but that's moral Excellence value
[48:04] Merit merous worth specifically moral
[48:08] Excellence Integrity now that would be
[48:12] as the world talks about virtue as far
[48:15] as and I listen don't get me wrong
[48:17] brother random said that that this
[48:19] virtue is not talking about being a
[48:21] virgin is everybody with
[48:23] me but it does have something to do with
[48:27] it some I'm not I'm not against brother
[48:29] random don't put that anywhere I'm just
[48:32] saying he's making a point he's
[48:34] separating it from what the world sees
[48:37] to what God
[48:38] sees but I can take that virtuous woman
[48:41] I'm going to talk about over here in in
[48:44] um Psalms or in in um Proverbs and bring
[48:48] it right back to me and
[48:50] you a virtuous
[48:53] woman that's right
[48:56] let's be playing a minute if you knew a
[48:59] if you knew a girl and we always I'm
[49:02] sorry let's say boy we always talk about
[49:04] the girls let's talk about the guys if
[49:06] you had this guy that was just a uh Liv
[49:08] as brother Claud said a hound dog life
[49:10] you knew all he wanted was to do one
[49:12] thing would you let your daughter grow
[49:14] out with
[49:16] him why he's a nice looking
[49:21] guy
[49:23] why you knew his background
[49:26] you knew what somebody said that
[49:27] somebody said that somebody
[49:29] said amen what kind of virtue is in that
[49:33] that's not moral Excellence that's
[49:39] immorality so you look at that you even
[49:42] in your life we look and see to not let
[49:45] those things
[49:46] happen please
[49:49] pray cuz you know what honestly we do we
[49:52] we we beat the girls up about being
[49:55] loose and promiscuous it takes the dude
[49:59] first okay everybody with me somebody
[50:01] out here takes the dude first the guy
[50:03] the man
[50:05] okay so let's just don't give it all to
[50:08] one side it's like Daddy said we call a
[50:11] woman a or a and then if the
[50:14] guy she's with puts on a suit and goes
[50:15] to church on Sunday you would call him a
[50:18] deacon that ain't right no that ain't
[50:22] right takes
[50:24] two
[50:26] so
[50:28] virtue it's going to change our
[50:30] thinking cuz I'm going to skip through
[50:32] this and not be so long today let me
[50:34] skip through this cuz we've already
[50:35] we've already seen all these talk about
[50:38] the heart we talking about the heart
[50:39] this morning remember the heart is your
[50:41] soul that's not this thing beaten right
[50:42] here it's your soul it's who you are as
[50:46] a man think is in his heart so is he and
[50:49] listen from your heart you're believing
[50:52] this Doctrine
[50:53] today you have obeyed made from your
[50:56] heart that form of Doctrine which was
[50:58] delivered you God delivered a prophet to
[51:01] us that delivered a message to us that
[51:04] has what it has virtue in it man if you
[51:07] don't draw strength out of this message
[51:09] you're not in the message the real
[51:12] one man what kind of strength and power
[51:15] does this does this message have what
[51:18] drawing power does it have but it's not
[51:20] drawing power to the whole world right
[51:22] somebody's going to find something wrong
[51:24] with it
[51:26] but if you have obeyed from your heart
[51:28] that form of Doctrine we all have a
[51:31] Doctrine we all are under a Doctrine
[51:33] brother R said if the church don't have
[51:34] a Doctrine they're not a church so we
[51:36] have a Doctrine it's the message of the
[51:38] hour the truth of the message of the
[51:40] hour anybody with me so from our heart
[51:42] we believe
[51:44] that see that's what draws me here not
[51:50] family not you I like fellowshipping
[51:53] with
[51:54] y'all
[51:56] but I come here because the form of
[51:57] Doctrine which I am obeying from my soul
[52:01] is to get here that's why brother Brown
[52:03] says you can't wait till those doors
[52:05] open to get here why because it's
[52:09] drawing it's a draw if you don't have
[52:12] that draw and that passion in your heart
[52:13] you're
[52:15] lost
[52:18] sorry I'm sorry but that's the
[52:22] truth cuz if brother R said that we must
[52:26] believe it so you obeyed from the heart
[52:28] that form of Doctrine which was
[52:30] delivered you now we have been delivered
[52:33] that Doctrine everybody with me all
[52:35] right and we see that there is virtue in
[52:39] it right there's virtue in this Doctrine
[52:44] we're going to skip a bunch of this CU
[52:45] we' got about right
[52:47] here this
[52:49] morning we believe in this Doctrine I
[52:53] rest my soul on Malachi 4
[52:57] that's what brother wither Rose always
[52:58] said and we do rest our soul in this
[53:01] message of the hour listen if this is
[53:03] not right we're all
[53:06] lost we're all absolutely the most
[53:08] deceived people in the world if this is
[53:10] not the right
[53:13] message but they're deceived if this is
[53:17] the right
[53:18] message if this is the right message and
[53:20] that's what we're putting our faith
[53:22] on and I'm not putting my faith on
[53:24] William
[53:25] BR I'm put my faith on he brought me God
[53:30] himself not a second person not a third
[53:32] person but the person of God he brought
[53:35] me to have a personal relationship with
[53:37] God so that I can draw virtue from that
[53:41] that we listen God met William brandom
[53:44] on a
[53:46] platform I'm just going to preach a
[53:47] minute he met William brandom on a
[53:50] platform all the time in the form of the
[53:53] Holy Ghost in the form of a light
[53:56] brother R said he's no more than three
[53:58] feet from where I'm standing he he
[54:00] didn't say it he said
[54:02] he where is that God of
[54:09] Elijah it's right here at the platform
[54:11] no more than three feet from where I'm
[54:13] standing well I don't see it none of
[54:16] them other people saw it
[54:21] either he said can't you see that light
[54:23] over that woman
[54:26] and they're all
[54:28] going
[54:30] no why it wasn't time for them I think
[54:34] it's time for me and you to start seeing
[54:35] that
[54:36] light to see that Pillar of Fire and
[54:39] have it work not just stay out there
[54:41] though I wanted to go in
[54:43] here but that was a conduit that God
[54:46] used to move brother brand and I it's an
[54:48] experience I've never experienced but
[54:51] where the brother Brandon would say
[54:52] something and he said my lips will go
[54:54] numb
[54:56] and I won't know what I
[55:00] said there's a lot of
[55:02] people a lot of psychologists to tell
[55:05] you that's not good that you don't know
[55:07] what you're saying but he put so much
[55:10] dependent on that being God and him
[55:14] never lying and never not telling the
[55:16] truth he had so much confidence he said
[55:19] hey use
[55:21] me use me right don't it makes me weak
[55:26] though it makes me where I don't
[55:27] understand sometimes brother R said the
[55:30] other day a while back he said I had to
[55:33] go back and listen to the tape again to
[55:35] see what I said he had to go back and
[55:37] listen to the tape to see what he said
[55:40] he had so removed self out of the way
[55:42] but did you did when we were looking at
[55:45] that at that video did you see some
[55:47] little you know little ghost thing go
[55:49] over here to the side no it all happened
[55:53] on the inside it happened in his heart
[55:55] in his
[55:57] soul he just for one second moved
[56:01] himself out of the way and let he even
[56:03] let God have his memory reason conscious
[56:05] effect and
[56:07] Imagination it can happen again it's
[56:10] going to have to happen for us to go up
[56:12] the statute of perfect man going to have
[56:13] to happen for us to have power with
[56:17] character We Believe brother R had power
[56:19] with character don't
[56:21] you where is that God of Elijah then
[56:24] where like Elisha aren't we Elisha
[56:26] brother M said we type elishah that's
[56:28] right he took that manle and he smoked
[56:31] that water and he said where be the god
[56:32] of Elijah well he was in Elisha so he's
[56:36] in me and
[56:39] you God of this evil
[56:42] 1965 brother Bram said the outside man
[56:44] is a physical being which is controlled
[56:46] by he said six senses or five rather the
[56:49] Inside Man is a spirit man which is
[56:51] controlled by five senses conscious Love
[56:53] talk about memory reason conscious f
[56:55] imagination outside castes feel smelling
[56:57] here but the inside of that spirit is a
[57:00] soul everybody with
[57:03] me and it's controlled by one
[57:07] thing you read it your free
[57:12] will your free
[57:15] will you see I believe brother
[57:18] brandom knew he knew was a prophet he
[57:21] had to know all the supernatural things
[57:24] but he he was so humble he wasn't going
[57:25] to say anything about it well I'm a
[57:28] prophet of this end time bless God and
[57:29] you got to hear me no God wouldn't use
[57:32] somebody like that he used somebody was
[57:34] so humble that he just let it and may I
[57:37] say he just let it ooze
[57:39] out and we caught it we caught the scent
[57:43] of that we're going to talk about in
[57:45] just a minute Mr Reverend Mr Lily or
[57:48] Reverend Mr
[57:50] flower you don't have to go out there to
[57:52] rose bush and say hey I want you to
[57:55] smell like a rose when you you know when
[57:56] you Blossom
[57:58] out no I don't have to go out there and
[58:01] tell the ochre plant hey you better give
[58:02] me some okra no if you'll do the right
[58:04] thing you'll get okra cuz that's what
[58:05] you
[58:06] planted so here brother brandham is he
[58:08] has put all of his will on to
[58:12] God and he says use
[58:15] me it scares some people to
[58:18] death to have God use
[58:20] them because that's a strange
[58:23] thing
[58:27] think about that I'm glad you're
[58:29] quiet you can accept what the devil says
[58:32] or you can accept What God Says and
[58:35] look and that'll determine what spirit
[58:38] is in
[58:40] there if it's the spirit of God it'll
[58:42] feed on the things of God it won't feed
[58:44] on
[58:45] anything of the
[58:47] world we talked about memory reason
[58:49] conscious effects and Imagination we
[58:50] know that this will affect our senses
[58:53] this will affect memory reason and
[58:54] conscious affection and Imagination
[58:57] everybody with
[58:58] me this will change you you say I've
[59:01] Been Changed yeah you've been changed by
[59:03] the new birth but Peter said
[59:06] add Peter said add to that
[59:09] change uh come up a little
[59:12] higher where God can use you
[59:16] more y'all look at me crazy sometimes
[59:19] when I look outside and I see a I drive
[59:21] down the road and I see an animal laying
[59:22] dead on the side of the road that
[59:23] somebody run over
[59:25] I caused
[59:27] that you caused
[59:32] that you did I
[59:35] did because of our carnal
[59:38] mind but guess what all that's groaning
[59:40] and waiting for it to be turned back to
[59:43] where Adam didn't have to look on side
[59:45] of a road and see a dead possum he
[59:48] didn't have to look and see a dead
[59:50] animal it was all life that's what we're
[59:53] going back to
[59:55] now inside of that Spirit which you
[59:57] become when you're born in the earth now
[59:58] look inside of that Spirit which you
[1:00:01] become when you're born in the Earth the
[1:00:04] Breath of Life is breathed into you that
[1:00:07] Spirit watch this that spirit is always
[1:00:17] Eternal that's not what it says does it
[1:00:19] some of y'all that are sleep need to
[1:00:20] wake up that spirit is of a what worldly
[1:00:26] nature because it was not given from God
[1:00:30] you have to be careful with what he's
[1:00:33] saying but it was given or permitted by
[1:00:40] God everybody with me cuz he didn't put
[1:00:44] eternal life in you when you were born
[1:00:45] that proves it right there I know I
[1:00:47] didn't have it and I know you didn't
[1:00:48] have it okay you said well I got these
[1:00:50] quotes you better make them match the
[1:00:52] Bible they better match the Bible they
[1:00:54] don't match the Bible then you got it
[1:00:56] wrong
[1:00:58] okay that spirit is of a worldly nature
[1:01:01] why carnal mind you were born in sin
[1:01:03] shaped in iniquity you were born by sex
[1:01:05] you were born by carnal nature everybody
[1:01:08] with me but it did come from God it was
[1:01:10] permitted by God it was perfect but not
[1:01:13] Eternal you were not born here with
[1:01:15] eternal life there was only one guy that
[1:01:18] happened too and that's the Lord
[1:01:21] Jesus Even Adam had to have the eternal
[1:01:23] life put inside out of him all right but
[1:01:26] it permitted by God now watch this now
[1:01:28] you get that for every child that's born
[1:01:31] in the world is born in sin shap in
[1:01:32] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[1:01:34] that's right so that person inside there
[1:01:37] is a sinner to begin with now this is
[1:01:40] 1960 and5 this is after the seals
[1:01:44] broke and he's still preaching salvation
[1:01:48] that you were a sinner when you were
[1:01:51] born so that person inside there is a
[1:01:53] sinner to begin with now it's got five
[1:01:57] endless and then five endless endless I
[1:01:58] don't know whether I can call them or
[1:02:00] not but the first I know is thought
[1:02:01] conscious he means memory reason
[1:02:03] conscious affection imagination there's
[1:02:05] five inlets to the spirit you can't
[1:02:07] think with your body you have to think
[1:02:10] with your
[1:02:11] spirit you have to think with your
[1:02:13] spirit you can't have conscious in your
[1:02:16] body this it has no mental faculties at
[1:02:22] all your body doesn't so you have to
[1:02:25] think with your spirit you have to
[1:02:27] reason you can't reason with your
[1:02:29] physical being cuz reason doesn't see
[1:02:32] taste feel smell hair reason is what you
[1:02:34] can make in your
[1:02:37] mind if you're asleep or you're out your
[1:02:40] body is lying there dead but your spirit
[1:02:42] can still reason he didn't mean dead by
[1:02:44] dead he means asleep all right there's
[1:02:47] five senses that control that Inside Man
[1:02:49] and now to the last man he's talking
[1:02:52] about the spirit realm he talked about
[1:02:53] the body Spirit now he's talking about
[1:02:55] the soul now to the last man which is
[1:02:58] the soul there's only one sense that
[1:02:59] controls that and that is free moral
[1:03:02] agency free will to choose or to
[1:03:06] reject so you do have something to do
[1:03:08] with
[1:03:09] this everybody with me on
[1:03:13] that listen to what brother Bown says
[1:03:16] he's praying a prayer listen our
[1:03:19] Heavenly Father Here lays before me a
[1:03:22] bunch of handkerchiefs they represent
[1:03:23] poor six suffering people one of these
[1:03:26] glorious days it's all going to be over
[1:03:29] and we're going to come up to your house
[1:03:31] God help us to be in the deepest of
[1:03:33] sincerity now bless us now I lay hands
[1:03:36] on these
[1:03:38] handkerchiefs thou knowest there's no
[1:03:40] virtue in any man but the virtue he look
[1:03:44] at the parentheses there was no virtue
[1:03:47] in the serpent nor in the brass that was
[1:03:48] made out of or the pole he's talking
[1:03:50] about when God told him to put the
[1:03:51] serpent on the pole and if you looked at
[1:03:54] that that you were healed that's why if
[1:03:55] you look today on Physicians doors and
[1:03:58] you look on anything to do with a with a
[1:04:00] doctor he there's a snake running up a
[1:04:03] pole that's exactly why cuz there's
[1:04:05] healing in that there's not healing in
[1:04:06] that it was what but the virtue was
[1:04:08] doing what God Said
[1:04:12] do the virtue was that they believed in
[1:04:15] Moses they listen what did they say they
[1:04:18] said Moses we don't want to talk to
[1:04:21] God you go talk to God in whatever he
[1:04:24] tells you you tell us and we'll do it
[1:04:27] now we know they didn't always do that
[1:04:28] but what did they do they put enough had
[1:04:31] enough um confidence in Moses to where
[1:04:35] when Moses walked up one day and said
[1:04:36] look y'all are dying by the thousands
[1:04:39] y'all are dying of this plague God told
[1:04:42] me to put this serpent on a pole and put
[1:04:45] it out in front he said if you look at
[1:04:46] that you'll live and then they started
[1:04:48] looking that and they all started Living
[1:04:49] they all started getting rid of their
[1:04:50] diseases they all started getting rid of
[1:04:52] all these things why it was because the
[1:04:55] virtue in that was doing what God Said
[1:04:59] to do that's why brother Brown says full
[1:05:04] obedience right full obedience to the
[1:05:09] word in other words brings you full
[1:05:11] adoption it brings you to full age it
[1:05:12] brings you to it brings you to a place
[1:05:14] of
[1:05:15] maturity right full obedience not part
[1:05:20] full obedience what God Said do
[1:05:25] and I'm going to tell you that's just
[1:05:27] part of all of our problem we don't do
[1:05:29] 100% of what God tells us to do all
[1:05:32] right blind bass 1954 we'll read this
[1:05:37] and we'll stop right here I think I
[1:05:39] think the shite woman went to Elijah and
[1:05:42] Elijah took the staff and sent it to Gaz
[1:05:44] and said lay it upon the child now
[1:05:46] Elijah knew that whatever he touched
[1:05:48] when he had the anointing of the spirit
[1:05:50] on him that it was blessed and I think
[1:05:53] that's what Paul Paul did and that's
[1:05:54] what the people saw it wasn't Paul it
[1:05:58] was the god on Paul and just a token or
[1:06:01] a symbol of faith in other words the
[1:06:02] clothes that Paul wore you see so they
[1:06:05] taken from his body handkerchiefs and
[1:06:07] aprons that's where I think we got this
[1:06:09] right he from brother brandham was
[1:06:12] talking about prayer claw way before
[1:06:14] that we knew anything about
[1:06:15] oursel right he would cut up prayer
[1:06:18] cloth and send them for free that's what
[1:06:19] the IRS was telling said you getting
[1:06:21] paid for these he said ' don't charge a
[1:06:23] dime he said what is the what do you
[1:06:25] call it trinkets or something they said
[1:06:26] this what is this thing you're sending
[1:06:27] out in the mail and he took them back to
[1:06:29] the scripture at Acts 19 said they took
[1:06:31] they took cloth off of Paul and they
[1:06:33] sent him out prayed over him sent him
[1:06:34] out and evil spirits left now the evil
[1:06:36] spirits didn't leave because of this
[1:06:40] cloth it was the power of prayer before
[1:06:42] the
[1:06:44] cloth it was the virtue of knowing that
[1:06:46] somebody earnestly
[1:06:48] prayed that these things work it's not a
[1:06:52] Hocus Pocus it works it's what God told
[1:06:56] us to do right and diseases went from
[1:07:00] the people what is that what would you
[1:07:02] imagine the people some people touched
[1:07:04] the Garment of Jesus and was made well
[1:07:06] others smacked him in the face and hit
[1:07:08] him in the head with sticks and spit on
[1:07:09] him never felt any virtue at
[1:07:12] all it was their
[1:07:15] attitude of
[1:07:17] approach it depends on what
[1:07:21] attitude you come in
[1:07:25] not the
[1:07:26] preacher not your
[1:07:29] neighbor it's What attitude you come in
[1:07:32] if you come believing that you're coming
[1:07:34] to get help and you're confident that
[1:07:36] you're coming to the right person Jesus
[1:07:38] Christ and you're coming his provided
[1:07:39] way of approach you're going to receive
[1:07:42] something if you come
[1:07:44] reverently if you come well I'll just go
[1:07:47] touch and see if it helps
[1:07:49] me that's not what that woman said she
[1:07:52] said if I could but touch to him of His
[1:07:54] Garment I'll be made
[1:07:56] well you know what that was her that was
[1:07:59] her
[1:08:00] voice saying I have got faith in what
[1:08:04] that man is Right same way with me and
[1:08:06] you sister hadie right didn't have a
[1:08:09] penny two nickel to rub together had two
[1:08:12] sons that were out in the world doing
[1:08:13] worldly things she said that ain't
[1:08:16] nothing brother Brown that ain't nothing
[1:08:17] but the
[1:08:20] truth he said sister God's pleased with
[1:08:23] that
[1:08:24] you ask anything you want he said she
[1:08:27] could have had Fortune Beyond
[1:08:31] Fortune there a sister sister edth her
[1:08:33] sister was sitting there in a wheelchair
[1:08:36] he said but she asked what she supposed
[1:08:38] to ask
[1:08:39] for something Eternal the salvation of
[1:08:43] my two sons and from The Virtue that was
[1:08:46] in what in what brother Brown said but
[1:08:48] it was a virtue and what she said she
[1:08:49] said brother Brown that ain't nothing
[1:08:51] but the truth and God said hey honor
[1:08:55] that hello somebody God said honor that
[1:09:00] my Prophet give her what she wants right
[1:09:05] just like the brass serpent while the
[1:09:06] serpent didn't have no virtue in it it
[1:09:08] was a piece of brass this is the cloth
[1:09:11] they brought it out of Egypt neither did
[1:09:13] the Paul have any virtue in it not a bit
[1:09:15] but it was obeying what God Said do what
[1:09:18] brought the power what brought the
[1:09:20] virtue is obedience to the word of God
[1:09:25] brother M says look we're not building
[1:09:27] an organization statue perfect man I'm
[1:09:29] not here this morning to build an
[1:09:31] organization Christ never sent me to
[1:09:33] build an organization Christ sent me to
[1:09:35] build individuals to the stature of
[1:09:38] Jesus Christ that they might be the
[1:09:42] PowerHouse not the jelly bag the
[1:09:47] PowerHouse and the dwelling place of the
[1:09:49] Spirit by his own word by his word see
[1:09:52] build up the individual to that place
[1:09:55] not build an organization to a greater
[1:09:57] denomination but build the individual to
[1:09:59] Sons and Daughters of God that's the
[1:10:01] idea see add to your faith virtue to
[1:10:04] your virtue at knowledge well now we're
[1:10:07] coming to a place let me read this real
[1:10:10] quick then we'll start back over
[1:10:12] Sunday Luke 6: 19 or read it before the
[1:10:16] whole multitude sought to touch him and
[1:10:19] there went virtue out of him and healed
[1:10:20] them all then we hear that the woman
[1:10:23] said what somebody touch me I perceive
[1:10:26] that virtue what vert that is strength
[1:10:27] the Greek word is dunamus just like when
[1:10:30] Jesus spoke the day he left this Earth
[1:10:34] he said go to
[1:10:37] Jerusalem and you shall receive power
[1:10:40] from on
[1:10:42] high that same word power is the same
[1:10:45] word Virtue is the same word that means
[1:10:49] dunamus or power Mighty work strength
[1:10:53] ability inherit power power for
[1:10:55] performing Miracles moral power and
[1:10:57] Excellence of
[1:11:00] Soul come on skip over and read down to
[1:11:02] the very bottom cuz I want to get to
[1:11:04] this then we'll back
[1:11:05] up don't look at that it make you
[1:11:09] sick all right right here I pulled these

[1:11:32] do the right of a Kinsman I need you to
[1:11:36] get the property of of my mother-in-law
[1:11:39] back and Boaz was the only one that
[1:11:41] could do it for all the city of my
[1:11:46] people now look Ruth is a
[1:11:49] moot an outs
[1:11:51] scourer the whole whole country of Moab
[1:11:55] was started by
[1:11:57] incest between lot and his two daughters
[1:12:00] brother Bram said a hair and the biscuit
[1:12:02] kind of a gaggy thing that's illegal
[1:12:05] now but that started Moab she comes out
[1:12:08] she's a moabit she's not of the House of
[1:12:11] Israel she has no inheritance but she
[1:12:14] married a
[1:12:17] Jew she married a
[1:12:19] Jew husband died you know the story
[1:12:24] her father-in-law died so there's nobody
[1:12:26] but Naomi and Ruth and Naomi had some
[1:12:29] property because remember the first
[1:12:30] thing happened was is they took him down
[1:12:33] out of the country because the famine
[1:12:36] was great so now they're back well now
[1:12:38] they're back the husbands have died so
[1:12:40] as as part of the r of redemption
[1:12:42] somebody's got to claim that land
[1:12:45] everybody with
[1:12:46] me so they move back in and here Naomi
[1:12:51] they got this little one room apartment
[1:12:53] maybe as we say now one room apartment
[1:12:56] and Naomi everybody knows who she is cuz
[1:12:59] she's from there but Ruth they don't
[1:13:02] have no
[1:13:03] clue but the first thing Ruth does is it
[1:13:05] says Hey Hey Mama Hey

[1:13:29] the
[1:13:30] hour but she was truthful to her
[1:13:32] mother-in-law she said hey your
[1:13:34] husband's dead my husband's dead we're
[1:13:35] in a bad way here I know there's some
[1:13:37] property over here that'll help you
[1:13:39] survive cuz you're an older lady I might
[1:13:41] conf find me another husband but you

[1:13:55] something they were kin folks right Boaz
[1:13:58] and her were kin to each other or the
[1:14:00] husband of and that property had to be
[1:14:04] redeemed back to somebody we know the
[1:14:06] right of redemption that would be Boaz
[1:14:09] but remember Naomi is not the one that
[1:14:11] instigates this whole
[1:14:13] thing she's behind the
[1:14:16] scene she's
[1:14:19] Jerusalem that's right she's the Jews
[1:14:22] that's right and she's behind the scene

[1:14:52] probably come from moabit and she was
[1:14:54] probably blond-headed and real thin
[1:14:56] skinned and she looked totally different
[1:14:59] cuz she wasn't of this group that's here
[1:15:01] she was totally out of their tribe so

[1:15:38] needed to do to get her mother-in-law
[1:15:41] hey that's what we're
[1:15:43] doing Ruth is the top of us we're trying
[1:15:47] our best to get Boaz
[1:15:50] here so that he can give the baby
[1:15:54] to the Jews so he can give the Holy
[1:15:56] Ghost to the
[1:15:58] 144,000 we're holding the whole thing up
[1:16:01] but that's all right for th my
[1:16:03] city my
[1:16:06] neighbors the whole town does know that
[1:16:09] thou art a virtuous woman and listen you
[1:16:13] say well that doesn't mean anything yeah
[1:16:14] it means
[1:16:15] power
[1:16:19] amen sisters brothers we always talk
[1:16:21] about sisters here again sister s and
[1:16:23] brothers if you keep yourself and you're
[1:16:25] a virgin that's
[1:16:28] power that is power that is control over
[1:16:35] yourself so to me virtue is power but
[1:16:38] virtue is mean that you live a virgin
[1:16:40] life aren't we supposed to be Virgin
[1:16:42] live virgin life aren't we supposed to
[1:16:44] be The Virtuous sinless bride of Jesus
[1:16:46] Christ we're the woman Proverbs 12:4 a
[1:16:50] virtuous woman is a crown to her husband
[1:16:52] but but she that maketh ashamed is his
[1:16:55] rotness in his bones see
[1:16:59] we are the
[1:17:01] crown of Jesus
[1:17:06] Christ not the denominations not the not
[1:17:09] this old sinful world because you know
[1:17:11] what they could be his bride they're
[1:17:15] women those other churches are women
[1:17:17] they're even though they're Harlot
[1:17:18] they're women and they could become a
[1:17:21] virtuous woman by accepting in the
[1:17:23] message of the
[1:17:24] hour but they won't do it so it's become
[1:17:27] rotness in his bone but a virtuous woman
[1:17:30] is a crowned or a husband so virtue is
[1:17:35] strength listen to this right here
[1:17:37] virtue always it always means righteous
[1:17:40] and just so if you'll take the word
[1:17:42] Virtue in the Bible and you'll run it
[1:17:44] through um strongs it comes up with all
[1:17:48] the remember it says these scriptures
[1:17:49] are used the same meaning righteous and
[1:17:52] just all the way through the the Bible
[1:17:53] means virtuous means virtue a virtuous
[1:17:56] person exhibits The Joint Excellence of
[1:17:59] reason and
[1:18:01] character you got to have both The
[1:18:04] Virtuous person not only knows what the
[1:18:07] good thing to do is he or she is also
[1:18:10] emotionally attached to it I like that
[1:18:14] he or she is emotionally not just that
[1:18:16] I'm virtuous
[1:18:18] no I'm proud that I'm
[1:18:20] virtuous I'm proud that I'm a virt
[1:18:23] to
[1:18:24] Christ that gives me what
[1:18:27] power that gives me strength what to
[1:18:31] beat the devil up with let's stand to
[1:18:34] our feet God bless you come on come on
[1:18:36] we'll read the rest of this later on but
[1:18:39] I like that The Virtuous person not only
[1:18:41] knows what the good thing to do is but
[1:18:43] he or she also is emotionally attached
[1:18:46] to
[1:18:47] that and when you're emotionally
[1:18:50] attached to something ain't it much
[1:18:51] better don't you get a lot more out of
[1:18:53] something if you're emotionally attached
[1:18:55] to it them people them ball games they
[1:18:57] are emotionally attached to what they do
[1:18:59] and you know what they get what out of
[1:19:01] it what they think now most of them get
[1:19:02] a big headache at the next day
[1:19:05] but we get
[1:19:08] God The Virtuous bride of Jesus
[1:19:12] Christ so virtue does mean power it
[1:19:15] means
[1:19:16] strength but it also
[1:19:19] means that if you live a virgin life you
[1:19:22] have
[1:19:23] power and you have
[1:19:27] strength and even if you like Ruth
[1:19:30] husband's
[1:19:32] dead even Naomi says uh honey if you'll
[1:19:36] wait long enough I'll try to find a
[1:19:37] husband and I'll try to have a kid so I
[1:19:39] can have a son cuz you know that was the
[1:19:41] right of of passage was if if um say if
[1:19:46] I
[1:19:47] died in the old times my brother would
[1:19:50] have to take my wife and go into her to
[1:19:54] have a son and then they would name it
[1:19:55] after this after me to keep the lineage
[1:19:58] going everybody knows that in the Bible
[1:20:00] that you're looking at me like I'm
[1:20:01] strange but it's not it's true right but
[1:20:04] what happened was is God made
[1:20:08] sure she had to go to
[1:20:11] Boaz there was nothing left remember
[1:20:13] because if if if if what was it Chon and
[1:20:18] maon want Ruth and and orpa if Ora's
[1:20:22] husband had a live
[1:20:24] she'd had to went in with him to have a
[1:20:26] kid God made sure this story goes right
[1:20:28] it don't matter what he took all of them
[1:20:31] out of the way he killed them old people
[1:20:33] all all them old demons that we got and
[1:20:36] he made us turn and look in Boaz field
[1:20:39] cuz we had no other hope we had no other
[1:20:41] help sure there was one more Ken but he
[1:20:43] didn't want nothing to do with us poor
[1:20:45] old devil but there was one Ruth said
[1:20:47] man and when Boaz saw
[1:20:51] Ruth he knew she was a virtuous woman by
[1:20:54] what she had done just in the small
[1:20:55] amount of time she hadd been in the
[1:20:57] city same way with you brothers and
