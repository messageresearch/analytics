[2:00] and enjoyed brother Chris long being
[2:03] with us our ministering Sunday I really
[2:05] enjoyed him and just appreciate the
[2:09] brothers that have always done told you
[2:11] I believe that there's others around the
[2:14] world that you know that are trying
[2:17] their best and striving for on things
[2:20] that I have hammered at it and hollered
[2:23] about it for 40 years you know and I'm
[2:26] glad to be able to make contact with
[2:28] anybody that I can see a desire in their
[2:33] heart for them to try to get the word to
[2:38] the people and get us all into good
[2:41] shape and all and get ready for the
[2:43] rapture for somebody to just talk about
[2:45] it in thrills my soul because that's
[2:48] always my desire and now this time I'm
[2:50] just playing I say it like this you say
[2:52] what do you agree with everything you
[2:54] hear no I don't agree with everything I
[2:57] hear I don't even even agree with
[2:59] everything I believe is that strong
[3:03] enough or is that plain enough to dis be
[3:05] honest and this straight you know I've
[3:09] always had an opportunity to change what
[3:11] I believe you know if somebody just
[3:14] showed me the truth you know that's the
[3:16] main thing to me but I I really
[3:18] appreciate the brother poured out his
[3:19] heart pray for him he's travelling
[3:21] around kind of in the area before going
[3:24] back
[3:25] alright remember the fellowship meeting
[3:26] will be the third Saturday and May over
[3:30] at brother pageants the 3:30 so we'll be
[3:34] living here in a neighborhood of one we
[3:37] don't have to be too early we won't stop
[3:40] and eat we may stop and get a little
[3:42] snack on the way but make sure if you're
[3:44] going you know and to invest with the
[3:46] van make sure you eat before you you're
[3:48] ready to go God won't be like we're
[3:51] having to do for all the others nanny
[3:54] took her test our Monday she will not
[3:56] know about it until she goes back to the
[3:59] doctor so just pray and believe and we
[4:02] think everything is going to be alright
[4:03] I talked to Danny a moment there I go
[4:07] about his testing things and and we just
[4:10] gonna believe everything's gonna be all
[4:11] right
[4:12] those we're not going to accept anything
[4:14] else cause like I told him the way this
[4:17] system is setup and the doctors and all
[4:19] now 98% of the people go into a heart
[4:22] doctor's office they got heart trouble
[4:25] 90% goes into order you call the
[4:28] orthopedic surgeon they got something
[4:30] needs to be operated on right and you
[4:33] know you never get I I appreciate the
[4:36] doctor telling me like Tony said
[4:38] whatever you're doing just keep doing it
[4:39] but you know he still wants his little
[4:41] hand in it he gets paid for telling me
[4:43] that that's just less that's what I mean
[4:46] if you you go to the kidney doctor 90
[4:49] percent of people are gonna have kidney
[4:50] problems no that's just the way the
[4:52] whole world set it up you know but we do
[4:55] appreciate all the things that they do
[4:56] and just keep praying for somebody to be
[4:59] like Danny and come through all of the
[5:01] things he's come through he's got a
[5:03] legal bona fide right to be sitting down
[5:07] somewhere in a wheelchair and letting
[5:08] somebody be taking care of him you know
[5:10] and rolling him around but he doesn't do
[5:12] that so that's the kind of my guy I like
[5:14] that I don't like somebody that just
[5:17] gives up and you know and just quit I
[5:20] like to see somebody that fights okay
[5:22] any other announcements missing brother
[5:29] Prakash will be with us the Lord willing
[5:31] on the I believe it's the fourth of
[5:34] November but it's the first Sunday in
[5:36] November I mean
[5:37] nope June June I just got to keep my
[5:41] months it's just somewhere this year
[5:43] he'll be here don't worry about but it
[5:47] is pray for me be traveling about you
[5:49] know ok first great anything else
[5:52] first Corinthians 11 and then we'll go
[5:56] to 2nd Corinthians and just try to get a
[5:59] little thought tonight and just move on
[6:02] in to what we've been talking about
[6:05] we're trying to do it it was just one I
[6:09] call them one-shot messages and all like
[6:12] that and that's not derogatory to anyone
[6:14] else a lot of people do that but I'm not
[6:16] based that way it'll strike and I'm like
[6:19] the old dog on a rabbit trail once I get
[6:21] on it I'll just keep running but I have
[6:23] to find a rabbit trail so we do that ok
[6:27] father we thank you for all of your love
[6:29] and your grace and to us thank you for
[6:30] everything father that you've given unto
[6:33] us and we know and realize that without
[6:36] you there would be nothing within any of
[6:38] us of mankind or anything any work they
[6:41] would be worth anything but yet you've
[6:43] taken our people that was worth nothing
[6:47] and you make a people out of them for
[6:50] your honor and your glory and we love
[6:52] you and we thank you bless each one
[6:54] remember the sick ones among us to the
[6:56] different things the requests that were
[6:58] given in tonight because we believe in
[7:00] we thank you and just have your way with
[7:02] us forgive our sins cleanse us Lord and
[7:05] cleanse our thoughts or ideas or all it
[7:08] would be anything contrary to You Lord
[7:10] just have your weight in Jesus name Amen
[7:16] 1st Corinthians 11 very familiar but I
[7:21] love this scripture not just because it
[7:25] is the communion Scripture but I love it
[7:28] because it's a wonderful thoughts and
[7:32] great ways to understand verse 26 see we
[7:36] come down through the cup into different
[7:38] things and says for as often as you eat
[7:41] this bread and drink this cup you do
[7:44] shew the Lord's death till he come
[7:47] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[7:50] and drink this
[7:51] cup of the Lord unworthily she'll be
[7:53] guilty of the body and blood of the Lord
[7:56] now this is the point but let a man
[7:59] examine himself now it doesn't say in
[8:03] the Bible for us to examine everybody
[8:06] else right there's no scripture to
[8:11] examine everybody else it's always to
[8:15] examine ourselves all right now but let
[8:19] a man examine himself and so let him eat
[8:25] of that bread and drink of that Cup for
[8:28] he that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[8:30] see and examine ourselves right right he
[8:33] does then drink of damnation to himself
[8:34] not discerning the Lord's body all right
[8:38] we know what happens beyond that and the
[8:40] thoughts but let's go to the 13th 2nd
[8:44] Corinthians 13 to just pick up the
[8:47] thought for tonight and it says examine
[8:51] yourselves whether you be in the faith
[8:57] prove your own selves now we'll get to
[9:04] that in a minute
[9:04] no you not your own selves how that
[9:08] Jesus Christ is in you except you be
[9:12] reprobates
[9:14] but I trust that you should shall know
[9:17] that ye we are not reprobates you may be
[9:21] seated the Lord that is blessing through
[9:24] the reading of the word now it says
[9:29] examine ourselves so we read in
[9:33] Corinthians you know we are to do that
[9:36] and before we take communion we always
[9:40] stop and give an opportunity maybe not
[9:43] verbally say if anybody's got anything
[9:45] to say or whatever you know but we give
[9:47] an opportunity to give a few moments of
[9:50] silent prayer to you know pray and to do
[9:56] and to try to get ourselves into the
[9:59] right order all right now
[10:04] I'm studying on a thought and I know
[10:07] it's gonna take a lot of dealing with it
[10:10] but I've been studying for months just
[10:14] letting the mind run this is thinking
[10:16] you know don't even have not one note
[10:18] just kind of pondering a thought of what
[10:22] is it really like to be a Christian you
[10:27] know is it a person who walks perfect
[10:37] you would only find one that be the Lord
[10:42] Jesus Christ didn't we turn around and
[10:46] condemn him because he took a wilt and
[10:48] run some people out of the temple one
[10:50] day and you see where my thoughts is
[10:55] running what is it really to be a
[10:58] Christian what is your thoughts about
[11:01] just being a Christian we know for
[11:07] certain - one thing that is not being
[11:09] perfect because we can't do that so that
[11:14] solves that problem you see where I'm
[11:15] where I'd be headed into the thout and
[11:17] it's just it's building up in one of
[11:20] these days I'll get on a other thing and
[11:23] take off with it I guess but now think
[11:25] about it Paul says when you come to the
[11:30] table of the communion he doesn't say to
[11:35] do this or do that he simply says
[11:40] examine yourself not to examine anything
[11:46] else not to examine you know this part
[11:50] or that part or try to examine anybody
[11:53] else or look at somebody else and say
[11:55] well they're not worthy I have a
[11:58] situation when done happened and I asked
[12:02] some people about it and and one brother
[12:04] said I won't set in the congregation
[12:06] with that type of a person I guess
[12:12] that's your thoughts
[12:15] but I said you sure not gonna set around
[12:19] here because it's not going the way you
[12:25] say it it's going away the Lord tells me
[12:28] to go it's not gonna be what you say now
[12:32] to examine yourself well what what do
[12:39] you do when it comes to the communion
[12:41] part I want this in every culture of the
[12:44] thoughts running with the message of a
[12:46] true Christian but what do you do when
[12:51] it comes to the community you know time
[12:52] of the communion and like I said we take
[12:57] a moment and this have a silent prayer
[12:58] now I wrote a random we can give the
[13:01] quotes of what to do and what does he
[13:03] say he says you pay pray for your pastor
[13:07] he said he prays for you a lot now if
[13:11] you don't pray for me during that time
[13:15] you know that's your end of the deal
[13:17] because I do pray for you now I don't
[13:21] pray 1 2 3 4 5 you know I pray a one
[13:24] lump sum Lord you know Lord come and
[13:28] make us all worthy to take this
[13:31] communion all right
[13:33] see that I'm not saying that you know
[13:36] for this Saturday I'm just saying we say
[13:38] well the Prophet said for us to do it
[13:40] that way all right
[13:42] so we we examine ourselves and how do we
[13:45] examine ourselves
[13:48] now watch the reference as we move over
[13:51] to the next message because it gets into
[13:53] proving your sale all right and then
[13:55] we'll pick it up a little higher on
[13:57] examine yourself you know I mean we
[14:05] don't have to sit down in and really
[14:11] what we do a lot of times is we we try
[14:14] to make oh I don't know what you would
[14:16] call it oh we make a situation that we
[14:20] let back into the hands of the Lord
[14:22] that's okay
[14:24] go we say Lord if I've done anything you
[14:27] know
[14:28] you forgive me is that a repentance or
[14:32] an examining of ourselves you know and
[14:34] we do when we come to the communion like
[14:36] I said we say Lord make me worthy
[14:41] admitting that I am not worthy or why
[14:44] would I ask for him to make me worthy
[14:47] right good it's not like sister was
[14:53] telling us other day that I went to this
[14:55] church and you've heard me tell it
[14:57] before somebody else did to that you
[15:00] know there's a group of people and they
[15:02] take the communion well they passed the
[15:07] plate
[15:07] they passed the bread among the
[15:10] congregation but nobody takes it well
[15:19] then they pass the wine among the people
[15:23] but nobody takes it because they're not
[15:30] worthy
[15:35] but there is selected special people of
[15:39] high ranks or whatever you would call
[15:41] them leadership etc they can take the
[15:45] communion well I think that's kind of a
[15:49] yeah well like a words that's a dirty
[15:55] way of doing things no because you're
[16:01] showing that nobody Dyer is worthy no
[16:06] well if we admitted it that's true but
[16:12] it's not God determining who's worthy
[16:14] it's mankind in that situation
[16:17] determining who's worthy I wonder what
[16:22] they would do if I walked in and sit
[16:24] down
[16:24] and they passed the communion and I I
[16:29] would probably get tossed out you know
[16:33] that would you know because they're
[16:36] serious about it and that we could go in
[16:40] to name in those type of groups but you
[16:42] know a lot of them things is heavenly
[16:43] group in earthly groups and all this
[16:45] that any other but yeah the point is
[16:52] when you're standing there to take the
[16:55] communion we're having to depend upon
[16:58] him anyway so we all admit that we're
[17:03] not worthy but we're not trying to pick
[17:08] out one among us that would be worthy
[17:09] and put them up and let them take it and
[17:12] rest ever sit there and look at him
[17:14] no we ask God to cleanse us to forgive
[17:21] us I think that should be our prior
[17:24] before we come to the communion table if
[17:27] she just simply asked the Lord to make
[17:29] us worthy well you know what he does it
[17:33] in a simple matter of the fact that he's
[17:35] already done it and he makes us worthy
[17:38] to do it and see what you're doing
[17:40] you're not examining him and in the
[17:45] communion you're not examining the
[17:48] situation we'll get to
[17:49] just a minute you're not examining
[17:52] necessarily whether you're believing the
[17:55] word your you're dealing with examining
[18:00] yourself as to you know ourselves as to
[18:03] where we are guilty and we need to be
[18:06] forgiving not that's why I read the
[18:09] Corinthians because see that way it goes
[18:12] on to say you know some take it you know
[18:16] and some are asleep because they take it
[18:19] because they won't examine themselves
[18:26] and see then they won't say well Lord
[18:29] you know I'm sorry I'm guilty would you
[18:34] forgive me that's the easiest way to
[18:36] take communion you don't have to make it
[18:39] a long lengthy prior you know how to go
[18:42] through all of the things and brother
[18:45] mote used to have a good way of saying
[18:46] it he said if you stole the man's horse
[18:49] you need to take the horse back but now
[18:54] what if you get it to the communion
[18:56] table and it would be good I am I'm not
[18:59] I'm I'm fine brother branham to say you
[19:01] know lay it down and go make it right
[19:03] okay but if you're honest and sincere in
[19:06] your heart and you intend to take the
[19:09] horse back the next day what would be
[19:13] wrong with taking the communion because
[19:15] you've made it right with the Lord
[19:17] that's my point
[19:18] not trying to deal with him to
[19:21] compromise or or anything just saying
[19:23] Lord now you know I'll do it so forgive
[19:26] me so he makes you worthy all right now
[19:31] you get that side of the situation out
[19:34] of the way well see then we go over into
[19:37] the second Corinthians and it says
[19:41] examine yourselves whether you be in the
[19:47] faith right now if we went down to the
[19:54] baptist today and we said well now what
[19:58] is the faith they give you a definition
[20:01] or a run-through
[20:03] of understanding of what the Baptist
[20:05] faith is and and you would say well well
[20:10] right now who do I need to examine
[20:12] myself by you know and they say well you
[20:18] need to examine yourself by the badge of
[20:19] faith you know you know they doubt their
[20:23] point well you go to the Methodists they
[20:26] would say well the badness ain't right
[20:28] let's imagine it's a right so we're
[20:30] examining ourselves according to the
[20:31] method it's dr. Pentecostal doctrine or
[20:35] whatever we are yeah but what about
[20:40] examining ourselves to see whether we be
[20:44] in the faith according to the Bible in
[20:50] Ephesians 4 and verse 5 the Bible says
[20:53] there's one Lord one faith one baptism
[20:58] what now he said yep yep it says many
[21:04] rewards in these many faiths and there's
[21:05] many baptism no there's none now Paul in
[21:10] his effort in his point to the people in
[21:12] Ephesus he knew that there's water
[21:15] baptism and this Holy Ghost baptism so
[21:18] what do you go you go to the total apex
[21:20] of the whole event and you're talking
[21:24] about dire one Lord that's all there is
[21:28] one faith one revelation and one baptism
[21:32] veteran said Holy Ghost baptism now
[21:37] looks like he'd be did and he said well
[21:40] now you got the baptisms written you got
[21:42] the baptisms
[21:42] let's see Paul's not saying it thataway
[21:46] Paul is saying put it to the apex put it
[21:50] to the top put it as far as it can go
[21:53] there's just one Lord yet we can read it
[21:58] in the Bible but the Lord said unto my
[22:00] lord that's in the scripture but that
[22:05] doesn't make two Lords right humanly
[22:10] speaking you can look at the word Lords
[22:12] and define that that's not what Paul's
[22:14] saying Laura saying I don't care what
[22:16] you think
[22:17] about all these Lords and all these
[22:18] things there's just one Lord right all
[22:24] right he says now I'm not talking about
[22:28] it because we all know and understand
[22:30] that we have water baptism and we have
[22:33] Holy Ghost baptism but I'm not talking
[22:35] about that I'm talking about Paul would
[22:37] say the top apex of it all is to call it
[22:40] the Holy Ghost baptism and then that
[22:43] would cover your water baptism because
[22:45] you ain't gonna get the Holy Ghost
[22:47] unless your baptism is correct right if
[22:51] you know now come on they we're human if
[22:55] you know you know the truth and won't
[22:57] follow it your God not gonna give you
[22:59] the Holy Ghost all right now then if
[23:02] that be true of one Lord and be true of
[23:05] one baptism well now how many face are
[23:08] they well you ask the Baptist and
[23:12] they've got their faith you guys the
[23:13] Methodist they got your faith you ask
[23:15] the Pentecostals they've got their faith
[23:16] which means their revelation of what
[23:18] they are you ask the people of this
[23:22] message and what do they go to you ask
[23:25] the two Lords and they've got their
[23:26] faith come on people in the message you
[23:30] got these doctrines all right you you go
[23:33] to you know any doctrine to sold
[23:39] anything to Lords you go to any kind of
[23:44] a doctrine and they call that their
[23:47] faith well now what would be the faith
[23:52] that would cover the whole form of faith
[23:57] as you would be covering the whole form
[23:59] of one Lord yet speaking of Lords and as
[24:07] you would take it to the baptism and we
[24:10] know this Holy Ghost baptism
[24:12] there's many feelings of the Holy Spirit
[24:15] many baptisms that away there's a water
[24:18] baptism uh-huh but yet we finalize it by
[24:24] coming back to the Holy Spirit baptism
[24:28] well we got to do that with the word
[24:30] faith or either we were not following
[24:32] her same line of thought right to
[24:37] examine yourself to see whether you be
[24:38] in the faith then there was a time down
[24:44] through time that Martin Luther he
[24:50] started out with the right point of the
[24:52] just shall live by faith and that was
[24:55] his faith right turned the world upside
[25:00] down through that faith now
[25:06] what hmm
[25:11] what's the wording what what point could
[25:13] we put as an apex as we would talk about
[25:18] the as we did about the Lord's you know
[25:20] as we did about the baptism what would
[25:26] be the apex are talking about your faith
[25:32] you realize then that we must believe
[25:34] what Martin Luther taught because it was
[25:38] the truth not everything he told right
[25:45] because he was a Trinitarian he was
[25:48] still hooked up with that but there was
[25:52] just one faith now if your faith will
[25:58] not compare with the faith of Martin
[26:02] Luther no I need to keep going over and
[26:06] over it we're understand we're human
[26:07] Martin Luther had a lot of things a lot
[26:10] of problems a lot of teachings he taught
[26:12] her Trinity he probably taught eternal
[26:14] hills and and everything he baptized
[26:17] wrong he had all kind of things but yet
[26:19] God talked so much other
[26:22] what are you doing until he put that
[26:24] anchor there of the just shall live by
[26:28] faith you realize then if our faith
[26:35] would be any different today
[26:37] Ramar ting Luther's faith
[26:41] we're making more than one faith John
[26:48] Wesley stood on what Martin Luther
[26:50] taught and brought the message for his
[26:55] day which would have been the faith of
[26:58] that day a sanctification you see why
[27:07] then that we as Christians and why
[27:09] brother Branham would emphasize it so
[27:11] much he realized that we're still
[27:15] anchored to that justification it's not
[27:20] the with you oh we don't need that
[27:21] anymore we're beyond that now where are
[27:25] you beyond it how are you gonna keep it
[27:33] one faith one Lord one baptism you got
[27:39] to find a position that will fit all
[27:41] things and see there's where this
[27:44] message comes in there goes it gives us
[27:48] the answer did brother Branham do not
[27:50] dilute there's message no he made it a
[27:57] foundation just as the Apostle Paul the
[28:03] Apostle Paul comes over in his writings
[28:07] and he talks about the wild olive tree
[28:12] the time holly tree the different things
[28:15] right and he says now listen we were we
[28:25] would say we don't want nothing to do
[28:27] with him o Jews all says now you better
[28:31] hold it
[28:32] he said because they are the roots and
[28:36] if you glory in anything you glory in
[28:39] the roots yeah but look at all they done
[28:43] look what all loser done look what all
[28:47] Westray done look what all the
[28:49] Pentecostals done but it was God's move
[28:52] of the hour right
[28:56] see Paul in his a defining Israel he was
[29:03] saying they are the roots you realize
[29:10] then we're grafted in to them without
[29:15] them there is no hope of Christianity
[29:20] oh we just we just by faith where's your
[29:25] revelation mo said there's just one
[29:31] thing but as I said you go anywhere and
[29:38] try to find out and everybody says you
[29:41] got to come to our church in our
[29:43] thoughts and our doctrine because we've
[29:47] got the faith well you know if that's
[29:54] true we better go right so now what are
[30:00] we going to define faith indulge
[30:08] well we're to examine ourselves and
[30:12] improve ourselves
[30:16] it's just as much in the proven as there
[30:18] is in examining are you with me Paul's
[30:21] reading we'll get to it as I said then
[30:25] Paul says don't you boast in that you
[30:31] are something said if you're going to
[30:35] boast boast in them roots back there
[30:41] yeah but they killed Jesus
[30:43] I'm not see those for you you're not
[30:46] following it are you gonna take out
[30:49] Paul's writings about that are you gonna
[30:52] dismiss that and rip it out of your
[30:54] Bible it Paul is saying our roots are
[30:58] Jewish no but brothers that we're the
[31:04] bride
[31:08] we're going to be a bride without their
[31:10] Jewish roots see one faith one
[31:19] revelation we said well that's a
[31:22] revelation of Jesus Christ amen
[31:24] in the revelation of Jesus Christ his
[31:27] ribs on the roots and we're grafted into
[31:30] it and remember what Paul says to show
[31:37] he's right
[31:38] he says you both did initially both that
[31:40] we said you just remember one thing
[31:42] there's coming a day then he's going to
[31:46] turn back to them and then you'll really
[31:50] realize the true faith of Abraham you'll
[31:56] find in the true faith but what I was
[32:00] looking at Abraham about because
[32:04] remember that's the roots
[32:08] he's a bit protective Oh fuse I'm gonna
[32:11] it's not all them all Jews is its the
[32:15] ones who had the faith right
[32:19] don't you want to be anchored to Abraham
[32:23] without that there's no hope but
[32:27] remember Jesus Christ comes when the
[32:28] seed of Abraham what by faith by
[32:32] revelation huh but then what are you
[32:37] getting at I'm getting to the one point
[32:42] of one thing
[32:49] how would we examine ourselves today as
[32:53] I said we've got all kind of doctrines
[32:55] around the message and you know that
[32:59] every one of them says they have the
[33:01] faith right and they say you got to come
[33:06] to their thoughts and their ideas
[33:10] because they are the ones it's got the
[33:12] faith what you know if that's true we
[33:17] need to tack up duds and leave I guess
[33:19] don't we
[33:19] I mean if it's true but why is it you
[33:29] don't believe all of those doctrines and
[33:34] ideas who is me and you the right to
[33:40] think about who's writing is wrong
[33:46] because it's mortal human beings
[33:48] wherever one wrong dunno how are we
[33:56] going to examine ourselves I get tickled
[34:02] about it and I'm not throwing off on it
[34:04] now but I you know I didn't come up to
[34:07] Pentecost but I come up with a lot of
[34:09] you that was come through Pentecost and
[34:11] and and I said listen that's he talked
[34:14] you know or did and you know in a they
[34:19] say well it's tried other spirit you
[34:22] know but what's the biggest definition
[34:25] of most people trying somebody spirit oh
[34:30] look I'm writing I'll try your spirit by
[34:35] looking you in a you just blanked
[34:41] I got you spirit see know how do you try
[34:49] spirit right how do you try spirit to
[34:54] see where that's right spirit or not
[34:56] well if it's good if it's loving if it's
[35:00] kind if it's wonderful no you got to try
[35:05] it by the word right are you with me
[35:08] you try spirit by the word huh
[35:12] but now by whose word I always did back
[35:21] there I mean I'm honest back in the bad
[35:23] person time I had a lot of thoughts that
[35:26] a lot of people didn't like talk about
[35:28] because my thoughts words for how they
[35:30] could be one Bible and so many different
[35:32] beliefs you know I didn't have to come
[35:36] in this message to find that out I found
[35:39] it out back guard you know that there
[35:41] was a lot of different beliefs and how
[35:44] could you do it with one Bible no no
[35:51] what you see what about examining
[35:54] yourselves let's read the rest of that
[35:58] scripture to examine yourselves see
[36:02] whether you be in the faith and he
[36:05] didn't just leave it dire he says prove
[36:13] your own selves
[36:23] no you're not your own selves now that
[36:28] Jesus Christ is in you except you'd be
[36:33] reprobate
[36:35] now how do you know Jesus Christ is in
[36:38] you
[36:43] what is the evidence to be able to
[36:50] anchor to word that we don't have any
[36:52] problems what was the evidence the
[36:55] Prophet had when he said the Holy Spirit
[37:02] had to straighten him out on his point
[37:04] of the even the evidence of the Holy
[37:06] Ghost right and he came down to the
[37:11] evidence of the Holy Ghost as to being
[37:14] whether or not your spirit would agree
[37:17] with the word see now then we have
[37:24] something to talk about
[37:27] because if we examine ourselves the
[37:33] correct way well see by that examining
[37:40] ourselves we're going to prove ourselves
[37:43] is that what he said and by proving
[37:48] ourselves we're gonna know that there's
[37:54] only one way to be in anything and
[37:56] that's Jesus Christ being in us or else
[38:01] we're going to be reprobates we're gonna
[38:07] be outcast we're gonna be then goes in
[38:10] there's only one way to try ourselves
[38:16] okay not trying one another but try
[38:21] ourselves
[38:24] [Music]
[38:27] now let's put it this way then Martin
[38:32] Luther had the truth
[38:34] we believe that see whether you realize
[38:38] it or not you you're an examining
[38:40] yourself that's what I'm getting at
[38:44] do you're examining yourselves to see
[38:48] whether or not you agree with Martin
[38:50] Luther will you take all of the bad
[38:55] parts and I don't think we won't agree
[38:57] with it in here so then what do we do we
[39:03] prove ourselves he says one brother
[39:09] branham would always that always would
[39:12] get me until say like the future home I
[39:16] remember first time reading that and
[39:19] thinking of what he said about 15 16
[39:23] explains but he's going to tell you
[39:26] about a future home right and what does
[39:31] he say he said we want to get this part
[39:37] here right about the new birth and then
[39:45] he said something to the degree of it
[39:49] doesn't do us much good to know about a
[39:50] future home if we can't look at what we
[39:56] have now we can't examine ourselves by
[40:01] the Bible terminologies of how that it
[40:04] would be that the future home would come
[40:10] how that it would be that the world had
[40:12] to be justified the world had to be
[40:17] sanctified justified in the days of Noah
[40:22] through the washing sanctified through
[40:24] the blood of Jesus Christ
[40:25] dropping upon and said one day it's
[40:27] going to receive a fiery baptism and he
[40:31] said our new birth is the same way so
[40:37] now see we're examining
[40:40] ourselves to see if what we believe will
[40:47] compare with all of those messengers
[40:50] through the ages right and we believe in
[40:56] Luther's justification we believe in
[41:02] Wesley's sanctification
[41:05] we believe in the baptism of the holy
[41:08] spirit they can move the day on the
[41:10] Zeus's Street see that way we're we're
[41:18] examining ourselves to see if our
[41:21] doctrine is that have you ever heard of
[41:30] message we're bread around them I'm the
[41:32] truthful you know one of me there's
[41:35] probably haven't never read a message
[41:37] yet they brought around didn't explain
[41:39] justification sanctification the baptism
[41:41] logos right I mean the truth you might
[41:46] be able to find one you know what I'm
[41:48] getting that the majority of every
[41:50] message he's basing it on justification
[41:53] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[41:56] Spirit
[41:58] he's proving the token by justification
[42:04] sanctification baptism he's proving
[42:07] Christ mister of God revealed by
[42:10] justification sanctification empty is
[42:15] one hold ago what do you do when he got
[42:17] into the seals he says now listen he
[42:21] said none especially I'm overcome in the
[42:23] back of the seventh seal
[42:25] he said now especially when this comes
[42:28] up tonight the way we're looking at he
[42:33] said just remember you got to go on with
[42:37] the same simple message what is the same
[42:45] simple message justification
[42:49] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[42:52] God
[42:54] that's the same simple message the that
[42:59] message fits every age and every thought
[43:06] now listen
[43:08] in the days of Martin Luther that
[43:12] message of the just shall live by faith
[43:13] you know if you didn't believe it the
[43:15] way Martin Luther taught it even in the
[43:17] age that true your salvation was not
[43:21] dark because he was the one that brought
[43:24] the way right all right now if we can't
[43:34] bring that over here now the title of
[43:40] the message is examine yourselves but
[43:44] there's a subtitle placed opponent that
[43:46] you know it's like this whether you're
[43:51] in the present truth or not
[44:01] you realized then why it says in in
[44:04] Hebrews 11 40 he speaks of Old Testament
[44:07] New Testament speaks of the whole thing
[44:09] they say without us cannot be made
[44:12] perfect that means somebody some work is
[44:17] coming to a present tense gospel and
[44:25] it'll be just like it was in the days of
[44:32] Martin Luther no no no see that's where
[44:39] you're not getting the simplicity of the
[44:41] gospel is it true that they was a bride
[44:48] in the days of Martin Luther is it true
[44:52] there were people that were born again
[44:53] or are you gonna say oh no there wasn't
[44:58] oh no them listen I've told you I've
[45:02] heard people say it you know pick people
[45:05] that claim they couldn't preach ever
[45:06] stand and say them Pentecostals was
[45:09] false me sitting there crying in my
[45:12] hearts and Lord keep me from getting up
[45:18] don't let me get up and say anything go
[45:22] that brother he's honest and sincere and
[45:25] that's his way of seeing things he said
[45:34] well what about a present-day truth you
[45:38] realize every age yeah my point ever age
[45:41] had a present-day truth and Mirat no
[45:47] matter what age is seeing it was a
[45:49] present-day truth something was present
[45:52] at that time which was God himself see
[45:56] God is the only one that could justify
[45:59] the lutheran sanctify the methodist no
[46:06] quoting brother branham baptized the
[46:08] Pentecostal and said in order the coming
[46:12] of the Lord
[46:13] only the holy ghost can do it though
[46:17] they were right back where we started
[46:18] that is one faith one Lord one baptism
[46:24] if we don't have the same Melissa if you
[46:28] Luther didn't have the same baptism when
[46:30] the Holy Ghost you got then he's got
[46:33] something different what you got there
[46:36] run now let me say it this way and let
[46:40] it just be plain blood if that Holy
[46:44] Spirit that we have is not the same as
[46:47] Luther had then we don't have God's Holy
[46:50] Spirit we're not in the person they
[46:52] truth cuz the other way you don't reject
[46:58] Luther right come on I keep saying it
[47:03] over and over cousin oh this goes out
[47:05] and I know it goes out in your mind too
[47:07] Luther had a lot of problems the God
[47:12] didn't look at his problems he looked at
[47:15] his revelation of a present-day truth
[47:18] and came on the scene and saved the
[47:21] world
[47:27] John Wesley moved a little higher but he
[47:31] anchored what he had and like I say in
[47:33] the other day he was anchored in John in
[47:35] Martin Luther's message then he seen
[47:40] that God was opening doors the
[47:46] Pentecostals all we think about his
[47:49] gifts and it's out of the other that's
[47:52] why I hammer it so hard and brother Ron
[47:54] said there was no messenger to Zeus the
[47:59] street he said cause the Holy Ghost came
[48:02] himself he said in the fullness of the
[48:06] baptism and called it another great
[48:11] prophet then ain't brother Branham
[48:21] the heat comes the end of the age mm-hmm
[48:27] but how are we gonna try anything what
[48:32] is our standard or what we do first
[48:39] message I preached in this church was
[48:41] going beyond man's camp and all I said
[48:44] was this one thing I said forgive us for
[48:47] pulling apart and moving on because this
[48:52] was July 2 4 1971 I said because your
[48:57] cabbage anon it and you're doing the
[48:58] same thing the Prophet said so we're
[49:01] just gonna move on cuz we're going on
[49:03] beyond man's camp we see we've got to go
[49:07] beyond man's count to go be where God is
[49:10] right no problems with anybody but
[49:19] trying to move on in God and trying to
[49:23] stay with a present-day truth
[49:32] trying to stay with the truth that will
[49:35] tie to ever church age he never born
[49:41] again believer goes that I just quoted
[49:46] the probably said to only goes to
[49:48] justify the neutered the same old ago
[49:51] sanctified the messages same Holy Ghost
[49:56] the old the Pentecostals CS whatever
[50:01] horse just gifts and dice you better go
[50:05] study a lot I've tried to say it lately
[50:08] to get you to think about it later
[50:10] Branham was not the first one that come
[50:12] forth baptizing in the name of the Lord
[50:14] Jesus Christ they were already doing
[50:16] that before he came on the scene now
[50:22] listen and then you you argue with me of
[50:24] us whatever young to that's your
[50:26] business
[50:27] those oneness people that come to that
[50:30] doctrine of the oneness was the
[50:37] present-day truth at that time you know
[50:43] and were closer to the truth than the
[50:48] ones baptizing in the Father Son and
[50:52] Holy Ghost did a name had to be restored
[50:59] see there was a day when the Baptist was
[51:02] God's present day truth there was a day
[51:05] when the Methodist was God's present day
[51:07] truth there was a day when the
[51:10] Pentecostals was God's present day truth
[51:20] there was a day when believing that God
[51:22] sent a prophet who is the present-day
[51:25] truth which there comes a day that we
[51:31] must move on not leaving the prophet if
[51:37] you think that is you didn't bad shape
[51:38] the way that I teach it and we're
[51:40] bringing it because I read everything
[51:45] with a present-day truth I'll get to it
[51:51] the Lord within and Sunday you know
[51:54] where the way brother Branham would talk
[51:56] he said revivals are over no more world
[52:03] wide sweeping revivals the delights big
[52:10] revival was Azusa Street we didn't need
[52:17] stop and he'd say but this revival that
[52:19] we've been inside all of them life stood
[52:21] not three and a half years when he said
[52:25] this revival we've been in has been
[52:27] going on for 15 years I said it's dying
[52:33] down he said people looking for a great
[52:40] we're alive flippin revival he said
[52:42] that's the Israel after we're gone but
[52:50] didn't he stops and he says but the
[52:53] bride hasn't had a revival yet now
[53:00] what's he doing he's telling you the
[53:03] truth
[53:06] he was in the present they truths right
[53:08] the president they truth would they're
[53:10] not gonna be more no more world wife's
[53:12] we've been reliable but he said the
[53:20] bride hasn't had a revival yet all right
[53:26] were we at then are you expecting a
[53:30] revival
[53:35] I'm quoting from the man you claim to
[53:38] have the present-day truth
[53:48] but do you believe what he's saying
[53:53] present-day truth let's just read
[53:57] something know what he says about this
[54:01] examining ourselves go ahead were number
[54:06] one brothers let's read a little bit
[54:08] questions and answers on the seals if
[54:13] you look back down examine yourself with
[54:15] the word and see whether your see where
[54:21] you're at
[54:23] well brother Dale we just floating along
[54:26] now we just kind of got into a slump and
[54:29] we just floating along where's there
[54:32] present-day truth to that I admit that's
[54:39] where most people are at well that still
[54:40] there's no problem that's I'm looking
[54:43] for a present they true and you women
[54:45] you got short hire let her grow if
[54:50] you're wearing shorts
[54:51] take them off act like a lady if you men
[54:55] are still smoking cigarettes and run to
[54:56] pool hall stop it I don't care how much
[54:59] you profess if you're still holding that
[55:02] organization and saying this is it and
[55:05] this is it
[55:06] you better stop look down and examine it
[55:10] with a word now like this one we're
[55:18] getting plumb out of we ought to live
[55:23] above the short hair and all this aids
[55:27] now we're back into something that God's
[55:33] revealing the hidden mysteries that's
[55:36] been put on the book before the
[55:37] foundation of the world what's he saying
[55:43] you realize there was a day when you
[55:46] were hearing about you
[55:47] close your dress you're higher in men
[55:49] those things of our lives you know our
[55:51] doings you know that was a present-day
[55:54] truth but then he said we need to move
[56:00] on or something move into what the
[56:10] revealing of the hidden mysteries Justin
[56:11] put on the book before the foundation of
[56:12] the world those who have obeyed in these
[56:16] small things will catch it in these
[56:20] other things if they haven't it'll go
[56:23] over the top of your head as far as the
[56:25] East is from the West because you're not
[56:28] recognizing the president they truth
[56:29] that's simply what I'm talking about but
[56:32] showing what he would say as we asked to
[56:34] start with how do you check spirits how
[56:36] do you check things how do you know of a
[56:38] present-day true you check it by the
[56:40] word right but just remember now what if
[56:51] what you're checking it with is not the
[56:56] present they truth
[57:05] well horses decide God in his word a
[57:12] present-day truth look at this one now
[57:18] for leadership go to number two you're
[57:25] talking about coming down to being a
[57:26] real Christian instead of that being
[57:30] impersonator sometimes you know not just
[57:32] examine yourself by the word by the
[57:35] message you see work church we're
[57:43] different from all the other people in
[57:46] this basis we at least claim to have had
[57:55] a prophet and if we need if we have a
[58:00] question we go to the Prophet to the
[58:06] Baptist Methodist not like that you know
[58:08] they got to go to the higher-ups in
[58:09] their groups or the fella that knows
[58:11] more this one does that or some
[58:13] Pentecost will come up with a prophet
[58:16] over here or this that or the other and
[58:18] checking it out the if we're checking it
[58:22] by the word and the word is the message
[58:31] you see why that when you ask me about
[58:33] something I say I'll show you what read
[58:35] around and said it I was well taught
[58:38] that from the beginning most of you know
[58:42] brother mo appreciate God putting us
[58:46] into that position to where he would
[58:48] anchor me into that place because if
[58:50] brother mote said brother Brown believed
[58:52] in one God he read it to you huh anybody
[58:56] remember that we used to ride the
[58:58] country and I'd memorized all of the
[59:01] books by color and brother mo had on
[59:04] every one of them in the back of his car
[59:06] sitting in boxes in volumes mine is
[59:11] still into this at home all of us in
[59:14] volumes
[59:17] and he'd say future home
[59:20] I didn't scramble and look I just
[59:22] reached in and got a blue book cause
[59:24] that was blue then and I just gave it to
[59:26] him if he said let's see what he's got
[59:29] of this evil a doubly on green
[59:31] either that or which one was it and you
[59:34] know I could just pull them up by colors
[59:37] because I'd read so much we'll see what
[59:42] he was he doing he was showing that
[59:45] brother branham said it not quoting it
[59:49] like I say a preacher gets up in the
[59:51] pulpit I'm not against anybody that you
[59:54] don't have to read quotes and everything
[59:56] hell you just preach if it's true God to
[59:59] him the words right or not but I do like
[1:00:05] to know where you got it from especially
[1:00:07] if it's something a little bit
[1:00:09] controversial line you know I do like to
[1:00:14] know work come from but I got anchored
[1:00:17] in that to work that but it's examined
[1:00:21] yourself by the word and he says by the
[1:00:31] message then why would he say by the
[1:00:35] word and then by the message no it's
[1:00:38] just what I'm describing to you we have
[1:00:42] a message but thank God is not just
[1:00:46] saying one guy come out and he'd say
[1:00:48] Martin Luther said so himself
[1:00:50] I heard him the other one come up and
[1:00:53] say no he didn't he said so and so cuz I
[1:00:55] heard then you had arguments with each
[1:00:58] other right let's see now you can say
[1:01:03] brother Ron said showing so he said well
[1:01:07] show me worse headed
[1:01:14] see we were instantly on a computer we
[1:01:18] could pull up those things at least to
[1:01:20] find the answers what about a
[1:01:25] present-day truth you understand what
[1:01:29] I'm getting in you realize the church
[1:01:34] the benefits and the opportunity that we
[1:01:38] have in this day to be able to ask a
[1:01:48] question and get an immediate answer
[1:01:52] well you just got the one you own it
[1:01:54] well okay
[1:01:55] bring the yours and let's see if they
[1:01:57] fit and the problem a present-day truth
[1:02:13] let's watch this one go to number four
[1:02:17] well I'm against organized religion now
[1:02:22] the church is predestinated to meet God
[1:02:25] without spot or wrinkle now if we are in
[1:02:30] that church we are predestinated with
[1:02:33] that church now examine yourself by the
[1:02:38] word then you can check up how far alone
[1:02:44] we are how far along are we I don't know
[1:02:52] we're just in a message we just believe
[1:02:54] how far along are we what are you
[1:03:03] expecting 50 years ago he said rather
[1:03:09] than what are you expecting I'm
[1:03:12] expecting an outpouring of the Holy
[1:03:13] Spirit to fill every fiber of my being
[1:03:16] and take me in the rapture because
[1:03:20] that's what the prophecy I'm expecting a
[1:03:27] great revival among the bride of Jesus
[1:03:30] Christ the God will do in 1 year or what
[1:03:34] theologists try to do in 2000 because
[1:03:38] the Prophet said it
[1:03:45] what are you expecting I don't know I
[1:03:50] just can't figure it out cuz I thought
[1:03:52] we'd be out of here in 73 and a half or
[1:03:54] 73 or 73 and a high 75 77
[1:03:57] I sure was gonna be gone what 77 I know
[1:04:08] we couldn't make 2,000 and many people
[1:04:16] sit back there books and things 77
[1:04:19] didn't take place
[1:04:28] but what about it he said if we examine
[1:04:33] ourselves by the word then we can check
[1:04:37] up how far along we are their words know
[1:04:46] right where we're at is that it that did
[1:04:50] that change what he said in you we'd
[1:04:52] know right where we're at by checking
[1:05:00] ourselves with the word do you really
[1:05:07] believe that just you live my faith as
[1:05:09] Martin Luther told it I said the truth
[1:05:14] now ain't there talking about all the
[1:05:16] ideas and opinions and ideas that
[1:05:18] mankind placed upon all of these things
[1:05:20] I'm saying there was a present-day truth
[1:05:24] and without you believe in that
[1:05:25] present-day truth you would miss it
[1:05:31] repeat we went through the church ages
[1:05:33] trying to describe just recently how the
[1:05:37] messenger comes in the age and what
[1:05:39] would happen and how did it fail and how
[1:05:42] that the messenger would always come at
[1:05:46] the end of the age not at the beginning
[1:05:48] it started it was start from there and
[1:05:51] all in explaining that Pentecost had
[1:05:55] failed the Orthodox Church and then he
[1:05:57] brought his message to a Gentile
[1:05:59] dispensation and seeing that in this
[1:06:03] last days it would be a very special day
[1:06:05] for the lysed
[1:06:08] because that holy ghost that would that
[1:06:11] came on a Zeus's street
[1:06:13] it's your prophet called it the holy
[1:06:15] ghost the prophet they call it the
[1:06:18] fullness of the baptism do you believe
[1:06:21] that
[1:06:27] because if you don't you're not in the
[1:06:28] present-day true because you you gotta
[1:06:31] go back and get that straight brother
[1:06:36] said one time to me he said what do you
[1:06:38] think about these people of the message
[1:06:41] brother Dale what are you talking about
[1:06:43] he's telling nobody didn't have the Holy
[1:06:44] Ghost like the book of Acts he said what
[1:06:48] do you think about the people this
[1:06:49] message I said I'll tell you the God's
[1:06:50] honest truth biggest portion of know how
[1:06:53] the baptismal oligos well here was my
[1:06:59] definition cuz it wouldn't be that much
[1:07:01] jumbled up mass right he's any problem
[1:07:07] with that
[1:07:10] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost we
[1:07:13] got problems but he's not gonna leave us
[1:07:15] in problems so we're to examine
[1:07:21] ourselves
[1:07:30] what a number five
[1:07:35] recognising your day in this message no
[1:07:38] nope just to the lice you can read the
[1:07:40] whole message part and look if you're
[1:07:45] hot-headed here you beyond hit it there
[1:07:49] if you're a doubter here you'd be a
[1:07:54] doubter there men and women it's time to
[1:07:58] shake yourselves and to examine yourself
[1:08:00] and see where we are standing or death
[1:08:05] does not change it if we're down here
[1:08:13] we'd be a doubter liar but if we're in
[1:08:18] the present-day truth now and we examine
[1:08:21] ourselves and prove ourselves didn't
[1:08:31] will be no doubters that right come on
[1:08:39] he's over brother Bramblett said you'd
[1:08:41] be a doubter doc now you know yourself
[1:08:43] what he's saying now this don't play
[1:08:46] with me and I don't play with you
[1:08:48] because that's all right
[1:08:49] you know we got a message but we know
[1:08:51] what the messenger was in his thoughts
[1:08:53] you know he wasn't saying they wouldn't
[1:08:56] we get to heaven there's gonna be all
[1:08:57] kind of doubt or sitting around now you
[1:09:00] know better damn so forget it he's
[1:09:04] making a statement or a thought or a
[1:09:07] concept to us that whatever we are here
[1:09:11] we're going to be that dire because
[1:09:15] death don't change other than our
[1:09:17] dwelling place present-day truth
[1:09:29] listen what he says here on number six
[1:09:31] letting off the pressure
[1:09:36] he says examine yourself take inventory
[1:09:39] see have I bypassed his word I know the
[1:09:49] Bible says that but I don't believe it
[1:09:53] that way be careful you're not dead yet
[1:10:02] if the Holy Spirit was in there he'd say
[1:10:05] Amen no now come on if you got the Holy
[1:10:12] Ghost in you and I read you something
[1:10:15] run around says and you can't Amen that
[1:10:19] then you don't have the Holy Spirit
[1:10:21] within you because remember the Holy
[1:10:27] Spirit's always been in the present day
[1:10:29] truth no matter what age but what's
[1:10:36] going on listen but I believe the days
[1:10:40] of miracles are pipes you do in the
[1:10:43] Bible said he's the same yesterday today
[1:10:44] and forever I believe that the signs of
[1:10:49] March 16 or for another generation you
[1:10:52] do when he said these signs shall follow
[1:10:54] them that believe how far to the end of
[1:10:57] the world no I'm with you always and the
[1:11:00] works that I do shows you do also how
[1:11:02] long to the end of the world all the
[1:11:04] promises of the prophets that's in this
[1:11:05] evening time the Prophet said there be a
[1:11:08] day it wouldn't be called day or night
[1:11:10] it'd be dismal
[1:11:12] you know he's talking about East and
[1:11:15] West and civilization we're on the west
[1:11:18] coast not physically the gospel wives is
[1:11:24] one across the United States and he
[1:11:27] ended it up right the next would go back
[1:11:30] over and it would fall back to Israel
[1:11:33] right alright so then there's got to be
[1:11:40] some water
[1:11:42] we don't have to have any problems in
[1:11:44] ideas that's where the trouble is you
[1:11:51] see we've we know enough of the message
[1:11:54] to be very destructive with it yes but
[1:12:02] he also said that was about a 1967-68
[1:12:10] quote right that you could say anything
[1:12:15] and they'd come back but he also said in
[1:12:21] other words making a contradictory and
[1:12:23] trying to show how smart we are trying
[1:12:26] to show how dumb the Prophet was that he
[1:12:28] couldn't keep it straight but he also
[1:12:31] said do you know what he was doing with
[1:12:35] that definition right he wasn't making
[1:12:40] it that the Bible says this but it also
[1:12:43] says he wasn't making it some
[1:12:48] contradictory Oh something wrong here
[1:12:54] right here or whatever he was telling
[1:13:00] the truth God said so and so but he also
[1:13:05] said if you took a certain line in the
[1:13:11] scriptures with a concordance you can
[1:13:14] prove that the oneness idea
[1:13:17] our concept is true
[1:13:25] what if you take your own concept or
[1:13:28] thought from it you can prove the
[1:13:31] Trinity is right to your own thinking we
[1:13:43] see we're not supposed to take our
[1:13:44] thinking why that's the profit what the
[1:13:50] answer is if you don't want the answer
[1:13:53] you're asking him to say what you want
[1:13:56] him to say right and then when somebody
[1:14:01] says but he also said present day truth
[1:14:08] exam when ourselves to see right where
[1:14:12] we're at where are we
[1:14:16] brother that we're on early we're right
[1:14:25] on time we're right on time
[1:14:31] what is that song and God may be four
[1:14:34] days late but he's always on time you
[1:14:39] realize you and I have the opportunity
[1:14:43] of studying the Bible as no one has ever
[1:14:51] had we don't have to say what is your
[1:14:56] input you know what is your thoughts but
[1:15:03] you see we're so smart ethically because
[1:15:07] when you say something the mind says but
[1:15:11] you also say it well all right are you
[1:15:13] making it contradictory oh no no I'm not
[1:15:19] doing that I'm just saying just saying
[1:15:21] what brother Branham said he said he
[1:15:23] also say it
[1:15:31] now according to my understanding he
[1:15:36] said the concept of the trinitarianism
[1:15:43] was wrong according to my understanding
[1:15:51] of what he said he said the oneness
[1:15:54] concept of God was wrong now that's not
[1:16:01] it he said but he also said that's he's
[1:16:05] showing you both of them drunk and he
[1:16:10] says in between dire he said I pulled in
[1:16:14] the vision or whatever a limb off the
[1:16:17] oneness and the limb off the Trinity and
[1:16:21] stuck it down into a tree or whatever
[1:16:25] you know and it grows into a gray tree
[1:16:28] what not - this hi friend he right he
[1:16:35] did not leave running out over here
[1:16:37] we're oneness and then was running out
[1:16:39] of yeah where Trinity he's showing you
[1:16:43] that by the Holy Spirit within him God
[1:16:47] gave him the truth
[1:16:50] both of them had truth but they didn't
[1:16:56] have the truth examine yourself
[1:17:06] what are you expecting Billy Graham made
[1:17:15] a statement one time outstanding that's
[1:17:19] probably I before even heard the message
[1:17:20] I guess but he said something like this
[1:17:26] paraphrasing it maybe but he said in the
[1:17:29] morning I'll get up looking for him and
[1:17:33] say if you don't come in the mornings
[1:17:34] that I'll be looking the next morning
[1:17:38] paraphrasing it I guess I missed it a
[1:17:40] little bit but his thought was what he
[1:17:43] was looking for the Lord according to
[1:17:47] the Bible he'll only come for those who
[1:17:50] are looking for him right so let's
[1:17:58] examine ourselves with the Bible and for
[1:18:05] heaven's sake we don't want to be like
[1:18:06] the one brother branham's listen to
[1:18:08] another day there that guy you know and
[1:18:10] I won't call his name cousin Anita but
[1:18:12] he said that Bible's been changed so
[1:18:15] many times and ain't even nothing just
[1:18:17] for good reading nothing to live by
[1:18:23] that's his concept you know what he has
[1:18:28] a great following around the world
[1:18:30] probably out of that concept that to him
[1:18:34] is a present-day truth what is your
[1:18:44] present they truth what are you
[1:18:48] expecting well really I don't know what
[1:18:51] to expect
[1:18:57] according to the Bible when I talk about
[1:19:00] visions like the according to the Bible
[1:19:03] it says without a vision they will
[1:19:05] perish as this message brought a vision
[1:19:09] to you that's not talking about seeing
[1:19:12] visions and a lot of people to say well
[1:19:14] I've never seen a vision so God would be
[1:19:17] disrespectful t-that's that's not what
[1:19:19] he's talking about right what is your
[1:19:23] vision or what is your thoughts about
[1:19:25] this day you see the reason I like to
[1:19:30] quote right around him is just the one
[1:19:32] else quoting wanna go he says God can do
[1:19:38] in one year what theology astir whatever
[1:19:42] you call that word in there is done in
[1:19:45] 2000 they didn't stop that's where we
[1:19:48] quote that was quote that one decided he
[1:19:53] said what he's doing it now he realized
[1:19:59] the person who walks out with this earth
[1:20:01] will really know what justification
[1:20:04] truly is and that's the way Luther
[1:20:08] called it oh not the doctrine the ideas
[1:20:11] or the end outs or what did this doesn't
[1:20:13] ever mm-hmm no he taught to just deliver
[1:20:17] faith you realize the one who walks out
[1:20:21] of this earth will be one who is
[1:20:23] following of the best that can do as
[1:20:27] human beings John Wesley's teaching of
[1:20:30] sanctification but I can show you in his
[1:20:35] own writings you know what he calls
[1:20:37] sanctification you ever notice brother
[1:20:42] Brown said he didn't say it about Luther
[1:20:44] but he said about Wesley he said Wesley
[1:20:46] at the new birth of sanctification you
[1:20:54] realize what Martin Luther tell me what
[1:20:55] John Wesley taught I'll be glad to bring
[1:20:57] you the book he taught that
[1:21:01] sanctification was the baptism of the
[1:21:06] Holy Spirit
[1:21:10] Martin Luther talk to him you know what
[1:21:15] John Wesley then must have taught that
[1:21:17] justification was the baptism of the
[1:21:21] Holy Spirit he was right
[1:21:28] Zeus the street with the baptism with
[1:21:30] the Holy Ghost oh it's just gifts you're
[1:21:36] you're you're not reading or listening
[1:21:44] what is the present-day truth how you
[1:21:52] said see what are you in the word or not
[1:21:56] prove yourself
[1:21:57] I thought the Bible spoke of proving
[1:22:05] ourselves not just in that scripture all
[1:22:11] when he would come out there and bring
[1:22:13] that message and stand there and declare
[1:22:16] the truth we only look at it as God
[1:22:21] doing this for that or the other as
[1:22:24] proof in signs but you know Paul
[1:22:30] couldn't do that because he told us the
[1:22:32] tech can't be running right away
[1:22:40] he tied everything he had why do you
[1:22:43] think he spent three and a half years
[1:22:45] the backside of the desert now listen
[1:22:48] then while quoting brother branham why
[1:22:51] did he go to backside to dead now listen
[1:22:53] why did he go to Peter James and John
[1:22:59] he went with him he went home he was
[1:23:02] with him it was right in these they were
[1:23:04] okay but he left there and went right by
[1:23:10] yourself with what not a book P eroding
[1:23:18] but with the Old Testament Scrolls Marah
[1:23:25] three and a half years a man studying
[1:23:27] the Old Testament Scrolls one time he
[1:23:31] used that after fourteen years so you
[1:23:33] can live flop but it's three and a half
[1:23:35] or whatever up taking the Old Testament
[1:23:40] Scrolls to see if what happened to him
[1:23:46] was right all right he was proving his
[1:23:55] experience come on we're supposed to be
[1:24:01] in today that we believe the prophet in
[1:24:03] billing the prophet then we must believe
[1:24:05] that Paul was teaching anointed ones
[1:24:07] just like easties anointed ones and Paul
[1:24:13] said there's got to come a falling away
[1:24:20] now let's get a present-day truth just
[1:24:23] for a minute Paul said there must be a
[1:24:28] falling away oh no I just take this over
[1:24:33] here where he said the Lord Himself said
[1:24:35] forever yeah
[1:24:36] boys for an archangel trumpet Agard no
[1:24:40] he said there's got to be a falling away
[1:24:41] come before that can take place you
[1:24:44] can't fall unless you're out place to
[1:24:46] fall look what happened when the Prophet
[1:24:51] left the scene
[1:24:53] oh they wouldn't our say the things they
[1:24:55] say today while he was here huh oh no
[1:25:01] after he left the scene he started a
[1:25:05] falling away well because we had reached
[1:25:09] a position where we could fall from
[1:25:12] because we had the message all said
[1:25:19] examine yourself to see if you've fallen
[1:25:21] away examine yourself listen to see
[1:25:31] whether your reprobates
[1:25:40] I see today it doesn't make no
[1:25:41] difference the people of the message
[1:25:43] they just accept everything coming and
[1:25:45] going you see why did it thrills my soul
[1:25:52] to hear a man preach some things I know
[1:25:57] it's true
[1:26:06] you see that's what I'm listening for
[1:26:08] and searching for we may differ in her
[1:26:14] ideas and approach in wordings and
[1:26:17] thoughts and ideas because that's the
[1:26:19] human element that's not present truth
[1:26:26] he said well how do you gonna prove that
[1:26:28] what Paul and Peter and little problem
[1:26:32] not our doctrine now come on nowhere the
[1:26:36] way Peter was behaving itself then what
[1:26:43] Paul done he just proved him a little
[1:26:45] bit think about it did Paul do that
[1:26:55] intentionally or did God do it I thank
[1:26:58] God led Paul to just kind of help
[1:27:01] straighten the old boy out and you know
[1:27:06] Peter never said another word
[1:27:07] oh you rebuke people to this message to
[1:27:12] tell them they're wrong and but they're
[1:27:14] not gonna speak to you from now they're
[1:27:17] gonna have nothing to do with you Peter
[1:27:22] he's just lined right back up why
[1:27:25] because he knew the man that had to
[1:27:28] present that truth
[1:27:31] is it right even though Peter opened the
[1:27:35] door to the Gentiles steal Paul brought
[1:27:41] the present-day truth
[1:27:47] you see we've had a message to come all
[1:27:50] the way down in this age to bring us the
[1:27:53] present-day truth and tell us what to
[1:27:57] expect
[1:28:01] you see most people are only expecting a
[1:28:04] a warmer than the White House oh that's
[1:28:06] well and good rush you're coming after
[1:28:08] all all that's well and good but has he
[1:28:16] spoke to you from this message they'll
[1:28:25] let you know where you stand
[1:28:33] present-day truth one day the Lord spoke
[1:28:39] to me out of the scripture he says
[1:28:43] you'll be there with your offspring
[1:28:53] Bible says tell it like it I'm just
[1:28:55] telling like it is but you know what I
[1:28:59] had never referenced a thought about
[1:29:06] that other than and I explained it to
[1:29:11] some brethren and they said you mean
[1:29:13] your children gonna be saved because
[1:29:15] they're your children I said you don't
[1:29:18] know what you're talking about I'm
[1:29:21] saying it never believed no such thing
[1:29:22] he never talked no genealogies or
[1:29:25] whatever I said my kids are gonna have
[1:29:29] an experience of their own not my
[1:29:33] experience my wife has to have her own
[1:29:36] experience not my experience he said
[1:29:47] well what brother do you mean you think
[1:29:49] all of your children gonna be saved
[1:29:53] why wouldn't you think your children
[1:29:56] could be safe now heaven help us come on
[1:30:01] heaven help us to try to think that if
[1:30:04] they're not good enough to get saved or
[1:30:06] to get changed cuz I'm gonna remind you
[1:30:08] you came from some water I ain't gonna
[1:30:11] play no games with you I'm gonna ask you
[1:30:14] where you came from what hole you got
[1:30:17] duck out of present-day truth well your
[1:30:28] experience hold you can you say it's
[1:30:31] brother branham said they said right
[1:30:33] around it you keep it a religion he said
[1:30:35] no it kept me
[1:30:41] we like being a Christian what about a
[1:30:46] man he got so down-and-out he climbed
[1:30:49] the fire pole one day and took his
[1:30:51] gloves off he was going to take his own
[1:30:59] life that's true what about a man that
[1:31:08] would take a gun to put his head
[1:31:11] oh we're not talking about the Prophet
[1:31:16] like that what about a man had come off
[1:31:19] the field not just because God took the
[1:31:24] gift away from him but he was a nervous
[1:31:26] wreck for what four or five years you
[1:31:29] came off the field he was a human being
[1:31:36] but he had the present-day truth least
[1:31:41] another day where he said had a burden
[1:31:43] all for years and years and years but
[1:31:48] then he relates it to when he spoke
[1:31:51] about the growth on his wife you know
[1:31:55] and the things and how it was gone he
[1:32:02] said that burden has left me you think
[1:32:10] he didn't examine his self every day of
[1:32:12] how many years was it that his wife
[1:32:15] carried that growth is he hurted for
[1:32:17] years it wouldn't even knock because it
[1:32:20] didn't appear for a long time
[1:32:24] think about it you think he didn't pray
[1:32:28] and cry out to God regard to deliver her
[1:32:31] for that God wouldn't hear him many of
[1:32:37] us would have ever DISA stayed with it
[1:32:39] kept on going but one day then God
[1:32:42] stepped down in a present day word a
[1:32:44] spoken word president talked and said
[1:32:50] now you say it
[1:32:54] he didn't say yeah you've been right
[1:32:58] you've done good you've live good I'm
[1:33:00] gonna take that away I think brother
[1:33:08] branham believed in the present-day
[1:33:10] truth because you know he wasn't looking
[1:33:13] for tomorrow or looking back to
[1:33:15] yesterday come on brothers he was
[1:33:18] standing in a present that truth can you
[1:33:21] say that what you believe is present day
[1:33:25] you're going to be tried right
[1:33:37] I'm out Ryan never been tried you ever
[1:33:44] looked at you baby and the doctor told
[1:33:46] her there's no way they could leave
[1:33:52] something happened but now let's say
[1:33:57] something about how he proved himself
[1:34:02] how many of you would have your baby
[1:34:07] laying in a I don't know what you'd call
[1:34:11] it
[1:34:12] comatose almost eight or whatever it was
[1:34:14] in in the hospital in the ICU unit yet
[1:34:25] we were having Bible study
[1:34:29] he left his baby laying in the hospital
[1:34:33] even his wife came to church
[1:34:42] Sunday services never Minister one I
[1:34:51] don't want to be tried like you I'd fail
[1:34:56] well you know how much confidence
[1:34:58] knowledge astray I'd stay like it is
[1:35:04] most of you can't get here because you
[1:35:06] can eased or done something you know
[1:35:07] anything you didn't make ever service
[1:35:09] cut some little bad cold or something's
[1:35:13] you know I'm talking about a present-day
[1:35:17] truth you know what happened to that
[1:35:20] little baby
[1:35:22] he said well are you trying to tell us
[1:35:24] we need to just leave our kids in the
[1:35:26] hospital see why would you say that I
[1:35:31] never told him to do it I told him he
[1:35:36] ought to be there with his child
[1:35:37] I told his sister sitting up back here
[1:35:42] or 20 years longer than that if she
[1:35:47] drove but for 20 years or more I told
[1:35:50] her I said don't you drive down here
[1:35:51] every Sunday from Charlotte North
[1:35:54] Carolina 250 miles down or something
[1:35:58] like that
[1:35:58] 250 back I said don't you do that I said
[1:36:01] I wouldn't do it I said don't do it
[1:36:06] let's get the tapes we'll send you the
[1:36:10] tape come down once a month and take
[1:36:11] communion you know what she's so
[1:36:15] stubborn she wouldn't listen to me she
[1:36:23] kept coming
[1:36:30] it might be that we're proving ourselves
[1:36:33] I hope you get the point
[1:36:38] we should have examined ourselves by the
[1:36:40] word see whether we're in the faith or
[1:36:42] not but then prove ourselves by the way
[1:36:45] we live about it but you know after all
[1:36:53] of these years she'll tell you the truth
[1:36:54] gonna hurt another sister what I'm
[1:36:57] talking about they would come down and
[1:37:01] go back but you know God struck my heart
[1:37:04] I believe one day and I told him from
[1:37:07] the pulpit I said don't you go home and
[1:37:12] you drive five hours or four hours to
[1:37:15] get home and you walk in your house and
[1:37:19] your husband say I need some supper
[1:37:22] let's go I'm tired I went to church I've
[1:37:25] been serving the Lord
[1:37:27] you want something Nico get yourself oh
[1:37:30] he would have ever justifiable right to
[1:37:33] say that right I mean truth that's it
[1:37:37] don't you do that I said he might not
[1:37:41] believe what you believe
[1:37:42] but you'll never win him into the gospel
[1:37:45] by being that kind of a person and he
[1:37:50] asked for something to eat you go get
[1:37:51] him something to eat go see you prove
[1:37:57] yourself do we prove whether we're in
[1:38:02] the faith or not by the way we live but
[1:38:05] how do you live good know sure don't I'm
[1:38:08] glad there's an advocate I'm glad
[1:38:12] there's an advocate but we can't live
[1:38:18] work nothing the best we can do ain't
[1:38:21] worth anything well then if it's that
[1:38:26] way I'll just live it away you will
[1:38:28] anyway won't live like a devil because
[1:38:31] that's what you are so you're not
[1:38:33] proving yourself to whether you be in
[1:38:35] the faith see if you're in the faith
[1:38:36] you're gonna be proving what you are you
[1:38:39] realize we're proving every day what we
[1:38:40] are before the world is seeing us
[1:38:43] your sister's going out to Walmart it'll
[1:38:46] brother wait hey I don't look at us
[1:38:48] they'll see you walking around they'll
[1:38:51] see you would you're along higher in
[1:38:53] your dress isn't it tight and not just

[1:39:05] up another day with it down and whatever
[1:39:07] they just see you you know that's gonna
[1:39:10] be a great witness my wife I don't know
[1:39:16] what it is but everybody wants to make
[1:39:19] her a singer everywhere she goes first
[1:39:28] thing people say it not how are you what
[1:39:32] you sing I guess you must have the looks
[1:39:39] of a singer you know I believe she can
[1:39:45] but my point is what people look at you
[1:39:50] and they see thing in your proving what
[1:39:55] you are by the way you live where you
[1:39:58] act even hotter one God water baptism no
[1:40:05] eternal health surface seat you can

[1:43:38] he said everybody else is gonna start
[1:43:40] pushing their butter he said it'll be
[1:43:43] over
[1:43:43] [Music]
[1:43:47] what am I getting at
[1:43:50] this message has a right answer
[1:43:56] we may have to call on one another to
[1:44:01] teach you certain things in just a
[1:44:06] little illustration brother right he
[1:44:08] picked up when I talking about how to
[1:44:10] search the message
[1:44:13] [Music]
[1:44:16] how to do it with that sign computer
[1:44:21] that mankind uses to destroy the world
[1:44:26] with we can use that same computer to
[1:44:29] search this message and realize if we're
[1:44:38] examining our sale
[1:44:45] [Music]
[1:44:54] it's not examining somebody else this
[1:45:00] examining ourselves
[1:45:06] [Music]
[1:45:10] let's forget about ourselves a couple
[1:45:15] trade on here and worship let he go
[1:45:19] forth believe in it
[1:45:20] God's gonna work it all out in the name
[1:45:25] of Jesus Christ we send these prayer
[1:45:27] cloths it's been proven if we believe
[1:45:32] understand you might get some advice so
[1:45:37] now you work out all of their problems
[1:45:39] now it'll be well in Jesus and when
[1:45:52] you're saying holy bang advice let's
[1:45:56] check our sail
[1:45:58] [Music]
[1:46:01] not look around in other people what I
[1:46:03] get some goodies anybody then ain't go
[1:46:04] to my let's look at ourselves
[1:46:10] [Music]
[1:46:18] I guess being pastors a little different
[1:46:20] from other things but I've always tried
[1:46:23] to get you to look at something the Lord
[1:46:28] allowed me and you've heard me tell this
[1:46:30] before but he allowed me to stand one
[1:46:33] day and look at somebody and to explain
[1:46:38] it there's no way to explain it all at
[1:46:41] once I went right back inside you know I
[1:46:46] was looking out like tunnel vision no
[1:46:51] standing looking at that person and what
[1:46:54] I'm getting at is at one part when I saw
[1:46:57] the person that's the natural I was
[1:46:59] condemning the person maybe had ever
[1:47:05] gospel rock - okay
[1:47:09] the when he brought me back into that
[1:47:11] tunnel and showed me the way he saw the
[1:47:14] person he's changed my whole outlook I
[1:47:21] don't look at people anymore
[1:47:25] thataway I don't look at them as a kind
[1:47:30] of condemnation I look at it that
[1:47:34] they're a human being the Lord just let
[1:47:38] me walk back in just whatever you doing
[1:47:40] don't ask me I can't explain when I come
[1:47:44] out of that thinking a whole lot
[1:47:45] different about everybody but brother
[1:47:52] damn it just rep rippln to pieces with
[1:47:54] that word see you're the person if
[1:48:01] you're thinking like that you're the
[1:48:04] person it's not examining yourself
[1:48:08] you're examining everybody Alex you're
[1:48:12] trying to make this thing run according
[1:48:13] to you and it's not gonna do it he's
[1:48:19] gonna run it according to his word just
[1:48:25] remember the Bible says never how you
[1:48:28] meted out
[1:48:30] was it say you'll be measured back to
[1:48:33] you that's perforated with his clothes
[1:48:35] front it'll be measured back to you so
[1:48:38] whatever you look at somebody else just
[1:48:40] remember that's the way God is looking
[1:48:43] at you know brother told me when time
[1:48:46] were told in a group they said brother
[1:48:48] Branham said brother said for more you
[1:48:50] staying where I stand he said everything
[1:48:56] you do is wrong but he said the more I
[1:49:04] stand were God stands he said everything
[1:49:08] I do is wrong you've never had a man to
[1:49:15] try to make some kind of a big show
[1:49:17] heavily it's what caught me was an
[1:49:22] honest and sincerity of a man and I
[1:49:26] remember when he made that statement our
[1:49:30] phrasing is pretty close but he said do
[1:49:33] you think that them staunch Jews and how
[1:49:38] well they were would any of them writers
[1:49:41] ever wrote of David and all of them and
[1:49:44] their problems they wouldn't road it
[1:49:48] said but God made them ride it that's a
[1:49:57] great way to looking at things in it
[1:49:59] father we just ask you to let what we've
[1:50:03] said to not just dwell in our hearts the
[1:50:06] Lord that we examine ourselves quit
[1:50:10] examining everybody else and examine our
[1:50:12] own selves and then it would look to you
[1:50:16] and did we prove what is that good and
[1:50:19] acceptable things that God wants make us
[1:50:27] to believe Lord and to see where we're
[1:50:29] at
[1:50:30] because no matter what we look forward
[1:50:32] or backward we've got to look at the
[1:50:34] present tense and see where we're
[1:50:35] standing because only then can we move
[1:50:39] forward
[1:50:42] is to know where we're standing be with
[1:50:46] us on the way home take care of
[1:50:47] everybody give a safe journey
[1:50:48] let your loving grace be with each one
[1:50:50] of us in Jesus name
[1:50:53] you dismissed woman in the Bible days
[1:51:03] are less being almost gone that's an
[1:51:09] Elijah
[1:51:10] take his word no said woman don't you
[1:51:16] worry God sent me today and before you
[1:51:22] even ask him help was on the way
