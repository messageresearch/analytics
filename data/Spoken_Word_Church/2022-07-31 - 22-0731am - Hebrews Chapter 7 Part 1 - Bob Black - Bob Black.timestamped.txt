[0:00] exceeded
[0:14] god bless you saints it's good to be in
[0:15] the house of the lord
[0:18] you ready for church this morning
[0:22] all right let's see if we can
[0:26] that's not it
[0:29] there we go
[0:30] all right
[0:31] so let's let's just uh
[0:34] just do a little background on hebrews
[0:36] uh where we come from this morning um
[0:39] we're almost to chapter seven
[0:41] and uh
[0:43] you remember paul was talking about in
[0:45] hebrews about how he's trying to lay the
[0:47] foundation that uh of
[0:50] of who christ is and
[0:52] and kind of walked walked the believer
[0:55] through
[0:56] as as uh the people that he was
[0:58] preaching to
[0:59] or
[1:00] wrote that letter to
[1:02] about how you begin to believe on christ
[1:04] and he walked them through the journey
[1:06] through the wilderness that how the the
[1:08] failures of the israelites they they uh
[1:10] failed to
[1:11] to to take god at his word and accept
[1:14] that he was taking them to the promise
[1:16] of of rest and then what rest is and
[1:19] um and then you know the whole book of
[1:21] hebrews is just an encouraging so
[1:23] encouraging about how you need to keep
[1:25] pressing on and and believing and endure
[1:27] to the end because we've got a promise
[1:30] that god
[1:31] gave us through
[1:32] not not just
[1:35] just just a a just a flippant saying but
[1:38] he actually made an oath on top of the
[1:40] word that he gave us so that we would
[1:42] have two immutable things to know that
[1:44] the god is gonna he's gonna see us
[1:46] through to the end
[1:48] so as we read through the uh where we
[1:51] are in verse nine
[1:52] let's just go to the author in prayer
[1:55] lord god we're so grateful to be able to
[1:56] gather together again and we just ask
[1:58] lord as we study these things out and
[2:00] unpack the scripture lord that you'll
[2:01] open these things to us lord and
[2:03] give us understanding we pray lord that
[2:05] you'll just bless brother wade as he's
[2:06] preparing lord jesus and get our hearts
[2:08] in mind for the services today lord that
[2:10] will be ready to receive what you have
[2:12] in store for us amen
[2:15] so in verse 9 it says but beloved
[2:17] we are convinced of better things
[2:19] regarding you and things that accompany
[2:21] salvation even though we are speaking in
[2:23] this way and i'm reading from nasb
[2:26] just to kind of
[2:28] change things up a little bit
[2:30] so
[2:30] sometimes this little bit
[2:32] can can help to your understanding to
[2:34] read from a different translation and
[2:35] then we're going to switch back to the
[2:36] king james version
[2:38] for god is not unjust so as to forget
[2:40] your work and the love which you have
[2:41] shown toward his name by having served
[2:43] and by still serving the saints and we
[2:45] desire that each one of you demonstrate
[2:47] the same diligence so as to realize the
[2:49] full assurance of hope unto the end
[2:51] so that you will not be sluggish but
[2:53] imitators of those who through faith and
[2:56] endurance inherit the promises so let's
[2:58] just kind of key in on those two words
[3:01] you inherit the promises to faith and
[3:04] enduring just keep at it the tortoise is
[3:07] the one that wins the race slow and
[3:09] steady
[3:10] faith and endurance inherit the promises
[3:13] for when god made the promise to abraham
[3:16] since he would could swear an oath by no
[3:18] one greater he swore by himself saying
[3:20] indeed i will greatly bless you and i
[3:22] will greatly multiply you and so having
[3:25] patiently waited he obtained the promise
[3:28] for people swear an oath by one greater
[3:30] than themselves and with them an oath
[3:32] serving as confirmation as an end of
[3:34] every dispute
[3:36] so god swore an oath that he was going
[3:38] to keep his promise and you think about
[3:40] promise
[3:41] in verse 17 it says in the king james
[3:43] version god willing more abundantly to
[3:46] show unto the heirs of promise that
[3:48] promise that he gave to abraham that he
[3:49] was going to that his seed would be
[3:51] blessed and the gates of the enemies
[3:53] would not uh prevail against this
[3:55] against this promise of the seed which
[3:57] is christ
[3:58] the heirs of the promise the
[3:59] immutability of his counsel confirmed it
[4:01] by an oath that by two immutable things
[4:03] in which it was impossible for god to
[4:05] lie we might have a strong consolation
[4:07] who have fled for refuge to lay hold
[4:09] upon the hope set before us now let's
[4:12] just meditate just briefly on all these
[4:13] promises that that that the promise that
[4:16] was spoken throughout throughout all the
[4:17] scripture in luke chapter 24 behold i
[4:20] send the promise the promise is that
[4:22] seed the seed which is christ
[4:24] the promise of the holy ghost in acts
[4:26] chapter 2 for the promises unto you and
[4:28] to your children
[4:29] in acts chapter 13 when paul was
[4:31] speaking he just said we declare unto
[4:33] you glad tidings how that the promise
[4:35] was which was made unto the fathers
[4:38] god hath fulfilled the same unto us
[4:40] their children and that he hath raised
[4:42] up jesus again as it is also written in
[4:44] the same in the second psalm thou art my
[4:47] son this day have i begotten thee now
[4:50] now just keep keep in mind as we as we
[4:52] make our way through the scripture that
[4:53] as we're getting we're getting close to
[4:55] chapter seven
[4:57] where paul's trying to make a case of
[4:59] who
[5:00] uh that christ is that melchizedek and
[5:02] that he came in the order of melchizedek
[5:05] to fulfill the promise of eternal life
[5:07] in us
[5:09] so in verse 19 he says
[5:11] which hope we have as an anchor of the
[5:13] soul both sure and steadfast and which
[5:16] entereth into that within the veil
[5:19] whether the forerunner is for us entered
[5:21] even jesus made in high priest forever
[5:23] after the order of melchizedek
[5:25] which hope we have as an anchor of the
[5:27] soul we've got an anchor
[5:29] this hope that we have is is something
[5:31] that
[5:32] will carry our whole life well you've
[5:34] got a promise of god you can look and
[5:35] read in in the scripture it it's
[5:37] something that will
[5:38] you can just hang everything on
[5:40] and what what what are we what are we
[5:42] hanging all of our hopes on
[5:45] that he entered it he was the one that
[5:47] entered into that that which entereth
[5:50] into that within the veil so what what's
[5:52] that veil that he's talking about
[5:55] brother braham said in hebrews chapter
[5:57] six he said in the veil
[5:59] the veil is the flesh
[6:02] the veil is what keeps us from seeing
[6:04] god face to face in this church
[6:07] the veil is what keeps us from seeing
[6:09] the angels there at their positions this
[6:11] morning so when christ
[6:12] as our forerunner entered into the veil
[6:14] he he came down and entered
[6:16] he he he came down to dwell in flesh
[6:22] the veil is what keeps us from seeing
[6:23] the angels at their positions this
[6:24] morning standing by the seats the veil
[6:27] is what keeps us from seeing him we are
[6:29] hid behind the veil and that veil is the
[6:31] flesh
[6:32] we are sons and daughters of god we're
[6:34] in the presence of god the angels of god
[6:36] are encamped about those who fear him
[6:39] but the veil is the flesh that's what
[6:40] keeps us out of his presence but through
[6:42] the soul the spirit by our faith we know
[6:45] that he's watching us he's standing by
[6:47] us he's here now
[6:49] so that veil that he entered he he came
[6:51] down to dwell in the flesh of christ to
[6:55] manifest himself in flesh the first one
[6:57] is the forerunner
[6:59] so that we would be able he would be
[7:01] able to dwell in our flesh after he died
[7:04] on the cross and went through all the
[7:05] process look at all the things that that
[7:07] is speaking of here that paul is talking
[7:09] about he said here it is hold it tight
[7:11] the veil is what keeps us
[7:13] from living the way we should veil is
[7:15] what keeps us from doing the things that
[7:17] we really want to do and god became
[7:19] veiled in flesh
[7:21] and the veil was tore into
[7:24] and god became god again and he raised
[7:26] up the veil that he hid himself in
[7:29] that's the resurrection of the lord
[7:30] jesus
[7:31] proving to us that in this veil that
[7:33] we're now hidden by faith we believe it
[7:35] and accept it and when this veil is tore
[7:38] into
[7:39] i'll go in his presence with this
[7:41] assurance knowing that i know him in the
[7:43] power of his resurrection
[7:46] at the coming of the lord jesus this
[7:47] veil will be raised up again in a
[7:49] perfected way till i walk and talk with
[7:51] him as my savior and my god when he
[7:54] takes the throne of david and will live
[7:56] forever in this veil after it's been
[7:59] perfected but this veil has sin in it
[8:02] it don't matter how don't ever think of
[8:03] that glorified body in this earth it's
[8:05] got to die same as your soul has to die
[8:08] to be born again now now see what's he
[8:10] said in the stage for he said the state
[8:12] before why did when in hebrews chapter
[8:14] seven we're going to get to the question
[8:16] why did abraham pay tithes to
[8:18] melchizedek he's looking he he's looking
[8:21] at this man
[8:23] why did so many not recognize jesus but
[8:26] behind that veil
[8:28] if you can recognize that behind that
[8:29] veil of the flesh there's a there's god
[8:31] actually manifested god came down to
[8:34] dwell within behind that veil
[8:36] both sure and steadfast and which enters
[8:39] into that within the veil whether the
[8:41] forerunner is for us entered even jesus
[8:43] made in high priest forever after the
[8:45] order of of melchizedek the forewater to
[8:48] come down and dwell in that veil dwell
[8:50] behind the veil to go through all the
[8:52] things
[8:53] that that you're going to go through as
[8:54] a christian
[8:55] let's examine that again we looked at
[8:57] that last time that everything that you
[8:58] go through as a christian christ has
[9:00] already done it because he's our
[9:01] forerunner he he was born in a little
[9:03] manger he he went down the river to be
[9:05] baptized with john he went on up to the
[9:08] mount transfiguration
[9:10] for where a voice said hear ye him he he
[9:13] he died to himself in the garden of
[9:14] gethsemane he rose from the dead as many
[9:17] of the saints were going to rise by that
[9:18] same power that caused him to rise and
[9:20] and he ascended up to go return back to
[9:22] the father
[9:23] just as we'll do when our bodies change
[9:25] then we go back
[9:26] you see what
[9:27] that whether the forerunner is for us
[9:29] entered has a lot of meaning because it
[9:31] means that everything that we go through
[9:32] as a christian
[9:34] christ already did it because he's
[9:35] veiled he he came down to be veiled
[9:37] behind that flesh
[9:39] to forerun everything that you'll go
[9:40] through as a christian brother iran said
[9:42] the forerunner the man that went before
[9:44] us as one come and took our place
[9:46] none other but god himself
[9:48] he come down and made himself a man for
[9:50] a forerunner to prove to the people why
[9:53] he swore an oath he was going to do it
[9:56] he swore he was going to save us he
[9:58] swore that we could do it he swore these
[10:00] things to him by himself
[10:02] to us by himself
[10:04] you see what a what a positive gospel
[10:06] we've got
[10:09] amen
[10:10] the greater is he that is in us and he
[10:12] is into the world
[10:14] then he come down and was made a
[10:16] forerunner he made himself a forerunner
[10:18] he entered here on the world and lived
[10:20] in the world sin all around him and
[10:22] above sin because he trusted god that's
[10:24] that should give us confidence to know
[10:26] that this that he's already done it he's
[10:28] already lived to prove that that that
[10:30] god veiled in flesh is able to overcome
[10:33] everything that the devil can throw at
[10:34] him so you've got that same life
[10:36] dwelling in you whatever the devil
[10:38] throws at you you're you've got that
[10:40] same that that's what that scripture
[10:41] means greater is he that is in us than
[10:43] he is in the world you've got that same
[10:45] overcoming power that's living in you
[10:47] now
[10:48] the same overcoat i got that picture of
[10:50] of of of jesus being accused by pilate
[10:53] you know apollo's asking what is truth
[10:55] and and and that that was god veiled in
[10:58] flesh that was not recognized by pilate
[11:01] and all the jews standing there that's
[11:03] that's what that's what paul is going to
[11:05] get to in hebrews chapter 7
[11:07] why did they not recognize that that was
[11:09] melchizedek veiled in flesh there
[11:15] brother brown said in hebrews chapter 60
[11:17] and he said the forerunner he tells us
[11:18] there's a place just beyond yonder where
[11:20] you're never and you'll never get old
[11:23] because he's a forerunner
[11:25] he he's he's come come back he he sent
[11:27] his word back to tell us all of these
[11:29] things there'll never be no wrinkles you
[11:31] won't have to use max factors to make
[11:32] you look nice to your husband the
[11:34] forerunner has went on there's never a
[11:36] place where you get old weary and shaky
[11:39] he entered in and immortal will stand in
[11:41] his likeness some day yonder the stars
[11:43] and the sun they'll out shine certainly
[11:45] the forerunner has gone before us
[11:49] now
[11:51] it says
[11:52] paul's saying whether the forerunner is
[11:54] for us entered even jesus made in high
[11:56] priest forever after the order of
[11:58] melchizedek so now paul's trying to lay
[12:00] a foundation that the order changed in
[12:02] the old testament they were the high
[12:04] priest was after the order of of aaron
[12:07] but in the new testament after the order
[12:09] of melchizedek so the order changed the
[12:12] structure of things changed the way
[12:13] things work changed and the way that it
[12:16] works in the old testament the order of
[12:18] aaron was a mortal you've got a mortal
[12:21] man that's going to die he's going to
[12:23] get to the end of his days he's going to
[12:24] grow a gray beard
[12:26] and you're going to have to get another
[12:27] one but the order of melchizedek is an
[12:30] unchanging priesthood in the old
[12:32] testament you have a priest that would
[12:34] go in and he'd have to go and repeat it
[12:36] every year and offer sacrifices over and
[12:38] over but the order of melchizedek is one
[12:41] sacrifice
[12:42] made that was sufficient for everything
[12:45] sufficient for you to be redeemed
[12:47] sufficient to pay the price this is the
[12:49] send it sufficient to make you perfect
[12:52] which in the old the old testament the
[12:54] order of error and it was not sufficient
[12:56] to make the believer perfect but in the
[12:58] order of melchizedek it was sufficient
[13:00] because it's an immortal eternal order
[13:03] an order that was
[13:05] an order that's set up
[13:06] based on the eternal life of god so
[13:09] that's the that's the the point that
[13:11] paul's trying to make is we're we're not
[13:13] believing something that's just based on
[13:15] man's ideas or legal ideas or or or or
[13:19] uh carnal succession of a man but we're
[13:22] believing something that's eternal it
[13:24] based upon the eternal life of god now
[13:26] so what is a high priest
[13:29] in the old testament the high priest was
[13:30] a the high priest was a mediator the
[13:32] priest played a role in preparing the
[13:34] relationship between god and man
[13:37] in hebrews chapter 5 it says paul
[13:39] remember if you remember what paul said
[13:40] he said every high priest taken from
[13:42] among men is ordained for me and then
[13:43] things pertaining to god that he may
[13:45] offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins
[13:48] who can have compassion on the ignorant
[13:50] and on them that are out of the way for
[13:52] that he himself also is compassed with
[13:54] infirmity so the high priestess is
[13:56] trying to restore a relationship between
[13:58] god and man
[13:59] and you know although all the the things
[14:01] that would be done on the day of
[14:03] atonement the scapegoat going into the
[14:04] wilderness and the other the other girl
[14:06] being sacrificed and uh the the blood
[14:09] being sprinkled on the on the on the
[14:10] altar and
[14:12] all of those things were acts that were
[14:14] typing out what christ would do on the
[14:16] cross when he restored relationship with
[14:18] heaven and earth kissed and he restored
[14:20] a relationship between god and man
[14:23] through what he did on the cross
[14:25] now you think
[14:26] who wha if if that was what the old
[14:29] testament high priest would do what
[14:30] would this new testament high priest do
[14:32] what would that look like what would
[14:33] this high priest do and
[14:35] you've got all these examples of christ
[14:37] now he's veiled in flesh walking on the
[14:39] shores of galilee and what's he doing
[14:41] he's he's fulfilling that role of a high
[14:43] priest forgiving sins they're in in luke
[14:46] chapter five when they could not find by
[14:48] what way that they would bring him in
[14:49] because of the multitude they went upon
[14:51] the housetop
[14:52] and he they lowered this man down that
[14:54] was that was all he had all these
[14:56] infirmities and when he saw their faith
[14:58] jesus said man thy sins are forgiven
[15:01] thee now what kind of a man would this
[15:03] be to forgive to forgive sin does it
[15:04] have to be god in flesh
[15:07] so you now now we're getting into a
[15:09] different order
[15:10] that god has actually come down and
[15:12] veiled in flesh somebody that can
[15:13] forgive you of your sins
[15:15] and
[15:17] brother brown said in living dying
[15:18] buried rising coming he said i'm not
[15:21] justified by anything i could do see now
[15:23] the order is being changed not from from
[15:26] works that you do where you gotta
[15:30] do do all these things under the old
[15:31] testament law i'm not justified by
[15:33] anything i could do none of my goodness
[15:35] i have none and neither do you but it's
[15:37] through his sacrifices
[15:39] through his death we are justified by
[15:41] believing on him
[15:43] there is where our justice stands not
[15:45] what i do or what you do but what he did
[15:48] for us
[15:49] that ain't the gospel story i don't know
[15:51] it oh give me that and take all the rest
[15:53] of it away
[15:54] see that one who died for me
[15:56] i see you've got this man that's god
[15:59] veiled in flesh and this this y'all got
[16:01] this little picture of this the little
[16:03] woman that came up and washed his feet
[16:05] and he said i forgive you of your sins
[16:08] the the little woman that they came to
[16:10] uh
[16:11] that they uh
[16:13] they dragged before him because she had
[16:15] been called in adultery and and he uh
[16:18] talked or wrote in the sand until all of
[16:20] her all of her accusers went away and he
[16:22] said i don't i don't i don't accuse you
[16:24] i don't i'm i'm not going to judge you
[16:27] i forgive you that that's god veil in
[16:29] flesh forgiving forgiving sin that's
[16:32] that's what this melchizedek came to do
[16:34] was to make things right
[16:37] so in hebrews chapter 7 and 6 if we read
[16:40] this again whether the forerunner is for
[16:41] us entered even jesus made an high
[16:43] priest forever after the order of
[16:45] melchizedek and if we go back to hebrews
[16:47] chapter 7 he says it is far yet far more
[16:50] evident
[16:51] for that after the similitude of
[16:53] melchizedek there ariseth another priest
[16:55] who is made not after the law of a
[16:58] carnal commandment
[16:59] but after the power of an endless life
[17:02] yes you see there's there's the there's
[17:04] the biggest example of that order being
[17:06] changed not after the law of a carnal
[17:08] commandment
[17:10] not after just uh
[17:13] trying to trying to find in your natural
[17:15] genealogy trying to search it back to
[17:17] see
[17:19] so many people in the message today it
[17:20] seems like they're putting more emphasis
[17:21] on their the way that you came naturally
[17:23] than the the new births you see that
[17:26] after the order of melchizedek is
[17:28] putting putting emphasis on that new
[17:29] birth eternal life not on the the way
[17:32] that you
[17:33] or what parents you came from or trying
[17:35] to search your genealogy all the way
[17:36] back to see if you maybe you came from
[17:38] adam or where you came from not after
[17:41] the law of a carnal commandment where
[17:42] where the succession of a high peaceful
[17:44] priest was passed down from one to
[17:46] another by natural genealogy but the
[17:49] power of an endless life
[17:52] eternal life is what we're talking about
[17:54] with melchizedek
[17:57] so in hebrews chapter seven we finally
[18:01] made it he says for this melchizedek
[18:03] king of salem priest of the most high
[18:05] god
[18:05] who met abraham returning from the
[18:07] slaughter of the kings and blessed him
[18:09] to whom also abraham gave a tenth part
[18:12] of all first being by interpretation
[18:14] king of righteousness
[18:15] and after that also king of salem which
[18:17] is king of peace
[18:19] without father without mother without
[18:20] descent having neither beginning of days
[18:22] nor end of life
[18:24] but made like unto the son of man
[18:26] abideth a priest continually
[18:28] now consider how great this man was
[18:31] unto whom even the patriarch abraham
[18:34] gave the tenth of the spoils i consider
[18:37] he's he's asking that question let's
[18:39] consider how great this man was that
[18:41] somebody like abraham would pay ties to
[18:42] him
[18:43] why would abraham pay ties to this man
[18:49] why why do we pay tithes in church
[18:54] and who is this melchizedek he said
[18:55] notice now his attribute
[18:58] so we got to answer the question who is
[19:00] this melchizedek
[19:03] and we're really answering the question
[19:06] why did abraham pay ties to this man
[19:08] why did this this man came walking up
[19:11] veiled in flesh
[19:12] uh god veiled in flesh why did abraham
[19:15] pay ties to it
[19:17] so we got to go back now brother brown
[19:19] was he begins to talk about how this man
[19:21] was god veiled in flesh he said now his
[19:24] attribute then the attribute was first
[19:26] god the thought the attribute itself all
[19:28] in one without being expressed
[19:30] then when he expressed secondarily he
[19:32] became then the word and then the word
[19:34] was made flesh and dwelt among us
[19:37] in saint john the first chapter in the
[19:39] first verse noticed this in the
[19:40] beginning but before the eternal in the
[19:43] beginning was the word
[19:45] when the time began it was word but
[19:47] before it was word it was attribute a
[19:49] thought
[19:50] then it was expressed
[19:53] in the beginning was the expression the
[19:55] word
[19:56] now we're getting where melchizedek is
[19:59] that's this mysterious person
[20:01] in the beginning was the word
[20:04] and the word was with god and the word
[20:06] was god
[20:08] and then the word became flesh and dwelt
[20:10] among us
[20:11] his first being was spirit god
[20:13] supernatural all right
[20:15] the great eternal
[20:17] second he began to form himself towards
[20:19] flesh
[20:21] in a theophany it's called the word a
[20:24] body
[20:25] this then is the state he was in when he
[20:27] first when he met abraham was called
[20:30] melchizedek he was in the form of
[20:32] theophany now we'll get to that and
[20:34] prove in a few minutes the lord willing
[20:37] he was the word now see there's the
[20:39] answer in the question why did abraham
[20:40] pay ties to him because he knew that was
[20:43] the word
[20:45] now now let's uh let's get ready for a
[20:48] deep dive
[20:51] now brother brown when he would when he
[20:52] would go back and talk about the the
[20:54] logos being expressed from the father uh
[20:56] a lot of times he would describe he
[20:58] would say in one place no you you're
[21:00] never gonna see the father and and
[21:02] there's no way for you to see the father
[21:04] the only way you can see the father is
[21:05] to see the expression of the father
[21:06] which is the logo the word being
[21:08] expressed
[21:09] if you want to see the father today the
[21:11] expression of the father is might be
[21:13] sitting in the chair next to you so you
[21:17] you've got to see the word express the
[21:18] word expressed shows the father that's
[21:20] why jesus said if no man can see the
[21:22] father except by me
[21:24] uh
[21:25] he said if you've seen me you've seen
[21:26] the father and and so when jesus will
[21:30] describe the father it's it's kind of
[21:31] there's no way for you to put a picture
[21:33] i've got i got pictures on the next few
[21:35] slides and i've only got five minutes
[21:36] but so we'll continue this next time but
[21:39] brother i'm going to describe the father
[21:40] in in
[21:42] in like a diamond or a fountain or a
[21:45] rainbow now you think of those all those
[21:47] attributes that be being expressed
[21:50] and now from that thing that uh that
[21:52] that form that you can't quite
[21:54] you you can't quite quite understand
[21:57] came the logos so out from that thought
[22:00] or the attribute i've got a picture of
[22:01] the of a diamond with all these
[22:03] different facets and brother and would
[22:04] explain it out from all those different
[22:06] the the facets you like you'd say you
[22:09] take a three a diamond with three points
[22:11] on it and you turn it different ways and
[22:12] you'd see a rainbow coming out of it
[22:14] and so out from that came that theophany
[22:16] body the logos body that that then was
[22:19] put in in a natural body
[22:22] or you put take a little fountain and
[22:23] brother around would say a fountain with
[22:25] streams coming out each stream would be
[22:27] a stream of love a stream of
[22:29] righteousness a stream of
[22:31] all the streams of the attributes of god
[22:34] and out from that the out from that
[22:36] attribute it was expressed the word
[22:39] so brother ram would say
[22:40] you say could you imagine before there
[22:42] even was an earth before there was a
[22:44] light before there was a star before
[22:46] there was anything there's a great
[22:48] fountain going forth of spirit and out
[22:51] of this fountain came the most pure of
[22:53] love because there was nothing for it to
[22:55] come from that but love
[22:57] now we what we call love today is a
[22:59] perverted love but just as we get an
[23:02] essence or a little bit of that love in
[23:04] us it changes our whole opinion but then
[23:06] out of there come another stream off
[23:08] this main fountain the diamond and it
[23:11] was called righteousness
[23:13] absolutely righteousness and he said now
[23:15] when these great lights went out a great
[23:17] rays of spirit love peace now don't
[23:20] forget though we're trying to answer the
[23:21] question why did abraham pay ties to
[23:23] this man
[23:25] when these great lights went out a great
[23:27] raise of spirit love peace that's all
[23:29] there was
[23:30] there wasn't no suffering there wasn't
[23:32] no hate nor no malice it couldn't come
[23:34] from this fountain that was jehovah that
[23:36] was jehovah god and now as the
[23:38] theologians call it a theophany went
[23:41] from that which was called in the
[23:42] scripture of the logos the logos that
[23:45] went out of god
[23:46] it's hard to explain
[23:48] but it was a part of god the logos and
[23:51] this grave found this great fountain of
[23:53] spirit which had no beginning or no end
[23:55] this great spirit began to form in the
[23:57] creation and the logos that went out
[23:59] from it was the son of god it was the
[24:02] only visible form that the spirit had
[24:05] and it was a theophany which means a
[24:07] body
[24:08] and the body was like a man
[24:11] and in the pillar of fire he said the
[24:13] bible teaches us that the logos went out
[24:15] of god or i may say all of the god
[24:18] becoming his first body form when the
[24:20] logos went out of god
[24:22] let's look what it looked like
[24:24] no one has seen the father at any time
[24:26] nowhere never did and never will
[24:30] but then the logos that went out of him
[24:32] became like a little become like a
[24:34] little halo of light
[24:36] let's see and play it
[24:37] let's see it playing under like a child
[24:40] before the doorstep of the father
[24:43] and now i can see him as he moves over
[24:45] here and he draws
[24:46] into his memory or his mind a picture of
[24:49] what the world
[24:50] should be
[24:51] now there's not a star or nothing and
[24:53] that interesting quote he draws into his
[24:55] memory or his mind what should i create
[24:58] and he knows he knows how to make it
[25:01] i hear him say let there be
[25:04] and an atom broke yonder
[25:06] and when it did the sun came into
[25:08] existence and began to whirl she burned
[25:11] for millions of years and millions and
[25:13] millions of years after a while i see a
[25:15] clinker fly off it
[25:17] what is it the first star that flew from
[25:19] the sun the musician can go ahead and
[25:21] come forward
[25:22] he watches it fall
[25:24] for a few million years and he stops it
[25:27] then another one flies off and he lets
[25:29] it fall a few million years and stops it
[25:32] what's he doing
[25:33] writing his first bible
[25:35] the zodiac
[25:37] in the beginning god was a spirit and
[25:39] all the fountain of goodness and mercy
[25:41] and power and all the good things of
[25:42] love god was the center of that fountain
[25:45] and then the logos that went out of god
[25:47] in the beginning become what we would
[25:48] call a theophany or a supernatural body
[25:52] god is just not like the heir
[25:55] but he's in a body
[25:57] in hebrews chapter four he said in the
[25:59] beginning was the same he was that great
[26:01] spirit fountain everything that was pure
[26:03] was in this fountain it began to form a
[26:06] body a theophany the kind of body that
[26:10] we go to
[26:11] and we'll stop there
[26:13] why did moses and why did abraham pay
[26:16] ties to that man
[26:18] because that was god building flesh
[26:35] mm-hmm
[26:44] you
