[0:00] thank you
[0:03] man God bless you Saints
[0:05] on this dreary rainy morning
[0:09] it's good to see you out with the time
[0:11] change
[0:12] might have a few stranglers but that's
[0:14] all right
[0:15] I was a
[0:17] I was working yesterday in the in the
[0:19] garage painting and listening to spoken
[0:22] word as the Original Seed
[0:24] and uh
[0:26] just having a good time and kept running
[0:29] back into the house to write notes but
[0:32] that's why I I got paint on my hands so
[0:34] if you see me today that's why my hands
[0:36] aren't dirty I just I couldn't get it
[0:38] off
[0:39] but um
[0:41] you know I was thinking about how it's a
[0:43] little bit uh the time changed and
[0:46] everything it's a little bit might be a
[0:47] little bit hard to stay away today but
[0:50] um brother random was you'd go back and
[0:52] listen to the spoken word as original
[0:53] see you when brother Ram was preaching
[0:54] that after people had sat for hours and
[0:56] he kept asking the people are y'all so
[0:58] y'all still okay
[1:00] and sometimes sometimes you know it's
[1:03] just a little bit hard but we we just
[1:05] keep pressing on
[1:07] so I'm gonna read this little quote and
[1:09] then we'll read our scripture and just
[1:10] kind of go into the study this morning
[1:12] the brother ramble said in the questions
[1:14] and answers on Hebrews he said there was
[1:17] no Bible speaking of of able there was
[1:20] no Bible wrote then but God revealed to
[1:22] him that it wasn't fruit that brought us
[1:23] out of the Garden of Eden
[1:25] it wasn't apples that Adam and Eve ate
[1:28] it was absolutely sexual things that had
[1:31] separated them and divided them and
[1:32] knowing that they become mortal so you
[1:35] think about that knowing that they
[1:36] become mortal and through the blood of
[1:39] Adam and through the blood of the
[1:42] serpent that had started this Abel by
[1:45] divine revelation went and got a lamb
[1:48] and offered it and God said that's it
[1:51] so we'll read our scripture let's just
[1:53] go to the Lord in prayer Lord God we're
[1:55] so grateful to be able to gather
[1:56] together this morning there's no place
[1:57] I'd rather be this morning with all the
[1:59] all the rain and all the all the clouds
[2:02] then in church this morning sitting
[2:03] together with your Saints Lord and I
[2:05] pray God that you as we just study these
[2:07] things out Lord that you'll give us
[2:08] understanding Lord that you'll help us
[2:11] to understand the mystery of these
[2:12] things and granted Lord that you'll just
[2:13] be where brother Wade as he's preparing
[2:15] the Lord to help us Lord to have the
[2:16] right attitude this morning and this
[2:18] afternoon to receive what you've got in
[2:20] store for us today we ask it in your
[2:21] name amen
[2:24] so in verse 4 of Hebrews chapter 11 it
[2:27] says by faith Abel offered unto God a
[2:29] more excellent sacrifice than gain by
[2:32] which he obtained witness that he was
[2:33] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[2:36] and by it being dead yes speaketh now we
[2:39] know as we've been studying this script
[2:41] these this this chapter out that the
[2:43] only way you can you can be acceptable
[2:45] to God that you can make God happy will
[2:46] say it like that is by Faith by
[2:48] Revelation in his word and man like like
[2:51] we kind of laid the foundation as we
[2:52] were going through the book of Hebrews
[2:54] that Paul's trying to get us to
[2:56] impressed in our minds that God has
[2:58] given us his promises and the god it
[3:01] cannot lie made the promise and all
[3:03] these things that God spoke to us so
[3:04] let's let's uh let's trust God and
[3:08] really the whole the whole doctrine of
[3:09] serpent seed and all these things are
[3:11] it's really about love do you love God
[3:13] enough to just have confidence in him to
[3:15] stay with what he said or are you going
[3:18] to start let wondering eyes look at look
[3:22] at the LIE of the devil so uh God's
[3:25] going to have a bride in this age that
[3:26] stays so true to him until she just
[3:28] becomes one with him until she's not not
[3:31] even one word off right well you know
[3:33] you sometimes we you meditate on that
[3:35] you think it's it's almost beyond your
[3:37] reach no God God Made A Way by sending
[3:40] us the prophet to rest if you go back
[3:42] and listen to the spoken word as
[3:43] Original Seed brother Brahman said at
[3:45] the end of that he said it looks like it
[3:47] looks like I get the people into a place
[3:49] where it's it's uh you know everything's
[3:53] just messed up all the doctrine's messed
[3:54] up but nobody's preaching right and all
[3:56] these kind of things but God gave a
[3:59] promise that I will restore
[4:01] I'm gonna get off my notes I'm gonna try
[4:04] to stay on track
[4:05] so in wisdom versus faith brother and
[4:07] said by faith Abel saw the Revelation
[4:10] the vision and brought a living running
[4:12] blood because life was in the blood and
[4:14] I got a little a little B over there
[4:16] pollinating flowers because they were
[4:17] talking about life
[4:19] life is in the stem of the flower and
[4:21] it's botany life which has no feeling
[4:24] I was in hopes that would soak in Abel
[4:26] by faith see he's comparing bot to plant
[4:29] life and animal life the reason why why
[4:32] Abel brought a lamb because he couldn't
[4:34] bring plants like like uh Kane did but
[4:38] but an animal's got some feeling with it
[4:40] it's got It's it's something that we can
[4:42] be identified with
[4:44] Able by faith staying with the word by
[4:47] faith not by wisdom by faith he's saying
[4:49] that it was blood
[4:50] the blood cell comes from the male the
[4:53] man has the blood cell the hemoglobin is
[4:55] the blood comes through the male and
[4:57] Adam knew that it wasn't apples and
[4:58] peaches and potatoes or whatever it was
[5:00] that brought them out of the Garden of
[5:02] Eden that caused the sin it was blood
[5:04] and he offered blood back and uh I don't
[5:07] we I don't know if we got any kids this
[5:09] morning I'm trying to speak with
[5:10] discretion most of the kids should be in
[5:12] Sunday school so
[5:14] anyway y'all can read the words on the
[5:18] uh by faith he done it not by wisdom how
[5:21] was a man through wisdom going to
[5:23] understand it when the whole Bible and
[5:24] the whole Church of God is built upon
[5:26] divine revelation by faith
[5:28] now you know it's a topic that you got
[5:32] to be a little bit Frank with and I was
[5:33] thinking well you know brother Brandon
[5:35] preached it brother Brown preached these
[5:37] words and there were people sitting in
[5:39] there a mixed multitude and whatever so
[5:41] it's it's it's it's a Doctrine that's
[5:43] got to be shared so anyway anyway we're
[5:45] gonna we're gonna Forge ahead
[5:50] here is the light Jesus Christ the same
[5:53] yesterday today and forever forsake your
[5:56] Creeds and believe this word this is the
[5:59] truth the word is truth Jesus said my
[6:02] word our spirit my word is life
[6:05] how are you going to receive life when
[6:07] you reject life
[6:09] how are you going to take in a Dogma
[6:11] which is death and a Word of Life turn
[6:14] out the word of life to take death how
[6:16] are you going to accept the two at the
[6:18] same time you can't do it let every
[6:20] man's word be a lie and every Dogma a
[6:24] lie God's word is the truth now now
[6:27] what's he talking about as we kind of
[6:28] laid the foundation last time but it all
[6:31] starts in the womb of your mind you
[6:32] listen to a lie of the devil and of
[6:34] course that's that's the greatest battle
[6:35] ever fought the Battle it out is it true
[6:37] or not when that when when somebody says
[6:40] something to you and and you have to you
[6:43] have to work out is it does it match up
[6:45] with God's word or not because God's
[6:47] word is a thing that we hang all of our
[6:49] hopes and everything on it's if it's not
[6:52] God's word we've got to throw it away
[6:53] and the spoken word is the Original Seed
[6:56] he said now let's go back now and pick
[6:57] up again and come down for something
[7:00] you remember what last Sunday's service
[7:02] was the gate to the soul now there is a
[7:05] womb of the physical there's a womb for
[7:07] the spirit did you believe that there's
[7:09] a spiritual womb and a physical womb and
[7:12] the mind is the womb to the spirit and
[7:15] we cover these scriptures last time that
[7:17] Paul told Timothy consider what I say
[7:20] and the Lord give the understanding in
[7:22] all things
[7:24] and in Luke chapter 8 we know the
[7:26] parable the parable is the seed the seed
[7:28] is the word of God
[7:31] and in the mark of the beast he said now
[7:32] what happens the heart is a womb and
[7:35] Faith cometh by open ear that's not been
[7:38] sealed by theology Faith cometh by
[7:41] hearing to hear the word comes into the
[7:44] mind you make up your mind about it is
[7:47] that right could that be right well the
[7:50] Bible said so I believe it
[7:52] down into the heart it goes then
[7:56] it's a womb
[7:58] oh you think about that now that as you
[8:01] receive in the word that you you hold it
[8:03] in your in your heart hold it you think
[8:06] about it and you meditate on it and you
[8:07] begin you begin to as you meditate on it
[8:09] you you're aligning yourself with the
[8:11] word and you say well that's it's it
[8:13] that's what the Bible says that's what
[8:14] the scripture says it says that I can be
[8:16] healed it says that I can be it says
[8:18] there's a promise for the Holy Ghost and
[8:20] you begin to believe that and something
[8:22] begins like you're you're it's it's a
[8:24] womb it begins to develop and begins to
[8:25] grow and mature until finally it's birth
[8:28] that's that's how you get a new birth
[8:30] you you receive that word in the womb of
[8:33] your heart
[8:34] and you just keep hanging on to it and
[8:36] sooner or later now what are we talking
[8:38] about what happened in the garden that
[8:40] Eve received that lie and just you can
[8:43] receive what you receive that the LIE of
[8:46] the devil or the truth of the word of
[8:48] God and you either one of those you hang
[8:50] on to it it's going to produce so how
[8:52] that's why that's how that that baby
[8:54] that that that that uh
[8:56] that Eve ended up holding in her arms
[8:59] that's how it was produced because she
[9:01] received the LIE of the devil
[9:03] and the mark of the beast he said then
[9:04] the then the male sex we are the bride
[9:07] the woman the seed goes into the church
[9:08] then the male sex which is the blood
[9:10] cell the blood of Christ is applied and
[9:13] in the blood comes a germ of life that
[9:15] goes into the seed and brings forth a
[9:17] newborn baby crying Abba Father Abba
[9:20] Father my God my God why did I ever do
[9:23] those things my god there you are
[9:27] and the spoken word is the Original Seed
[9:29] he said that's how adultery is committed
[9:31] spiritually and I got a little girl
[9:33] looking at grabbing cookies she's like
[9:36] you you doing something that you know
[9:38] you ought not to do it's about knowing
[9:41] better by the word of God by the
[9:43] Intercourse of the Mind take in a lie of
[9:45] the devil against the word of God that's
[9:49] exactly what Eve done with a spiritual
[9:51] intercourse first that come by believing
[9:54] Satan's life into the womb or for mine
[9:57] that polluted her soul set death in the
[9:59] soul then the next then the natural act
[10:01] taking place
[10:02] and that's the only way that a woman
[10:04] ever and can commit adultery against her
[10:06] husband is to first let some man talk
[10:08] her into it and then receive another man
[10:11] that's not her husband then she's
[10:13] committed adultery
[10:16] and the spoken word is the Original Seed
[10:17] again brother Brown said and win the
[10:19] church today
[10:20] let's call themselves Pentecostal call
[10:23] themselves Baptists whatever they want
[10:25] to when they hybrid this word with Dogma
[10:27] it produces a dead child and she can't
[10:31] have no life in her oh oh what a
[10:34] powerful quote that is to think you say
[10:36] you were looking the Bible and you say
[10:38] well this is how to be baptized and then
[10:40] you mix something else with it then well
[10:43] you you're going to be you you can't
[10:45] produce nothing you say that the promise
[10:47] of the Holy Ghost is for you and then
[10:49] you throw in some other things well
[10:50] because of your mom and daddy wasn't
[10:52] married you can't receive the new birth
[10:54] or something something strange like that
[10:55] then all of a sudden you're you how are
[10:57] you going to have faith on that you mix
[10:58] something in there and you you it just
[11:01] destroys your your confidence
[11:03] but if you just look straight to the
[11:04] word and say if there's a promise laying
[11:07] there I can have it then you hold it in
[11:09] the womb of your of your mind and begin
[11:11] just begin to meditate on that and it's
[11:13] going to produce
[11:15] God said I'll throw her in a bed of
[11:17] worldliness and kill her children God
[11:19] said so in Revelation how many knows
[11:21] that's true
[11:23] he said oh you can't make the word lies
[11:25] the truth
[11:26] and in the spoken word is the Original
[11:28] Seed again he said so Jehovah's bride
[11:30] went and what did she do she
[11:32] brought forth a bunch of illegitimates
[11:34] again
[11:34] is that right we know it's the truth
[11:37] even had to be taken away by King
[11:39] Nebuchadnezzar and so forth Christ's
[11:41] bride has done the same what's the
[11:43] matter
[11:44] can't wait
[11:46] just can't wait
[11:48] oh you see why he keeps hammering that
[11:50] About Eve couldn't wait she had she
[11:52] wanted to get sometimes you know oh you
[11:55] know you've seen that all around the
[11:56] message somebody wants to know more than
[11:58] everybody else somebody wants to have a
[12:00] greater Revelation and so instead of
[12:02] just waiting on God for that they jump
[12:04] to it and then they get off they get off
[12:06] kilter and go off into something strange
[12:07] and that's that's exactly what Eve did
[12:10] she just couldn't wait for God to come
[12:11] on the scene and reveal it to reveal
[12:13] interpret his word and show how the word
[12:16] was going to be made manifest and prove
[12:17] the word but she jumped she jumped the
[12:19] gun
[12:20] they've got a manufacture something they
[12:23] can't wait for the Holy Spirit to come
[12:25] and get into the church
[12:26] oh you see how this happened in so many
[12:28] people's lives too they instead of
[12:30] waiting they they want to they want to
[12:32] manufacture something and be a be a fake
[12:35] believer you see if you jump and you and
[12:38] you can't wait then all of a sudden
[12:39] you're just a religious uh person going
[12:42] to church you got uh trying to go
[12:44] through the motions and appear outwardly
[12:46] like you're like you're genuine because
[12:48] you couldn't wait now you're trying to
[12:50] manufacture and try to force it but if
[12:52] you'll just wait God will give something
[12:54] genuine if you'll just wait
[12:57] uh
[12:58] he said if it had stayed the way it was
[13:00] back Yonder 100 years ago or 50 years
[13:03] ago when Pentecost first started out on
[13:05] this Latter day when the world began to
[13:06] be preached if it had stayed like that
[13:09] she probably wouldn't have have had
[13:11] wouldn't had over 50 members today
[13:14] that's right but they would be Blood
[13:16] Washed they'd have the power of God in
[13:19] them the world will be shaken under her
[13:21] tremendous impact of the word flesh
[13:23] being spoken word by word but today why
[13:26] he's talking to the Pentecostal Church
[13:28] why it's a sounding brass and a tinkling
[13:30] symbol
[13:31] that's right just become nonsense a
[13:34] laughing block a disgrace to the world
[13:36] disgrace to God why because they
[13:38] couldn't wait
[13:39] to wait on the just wait if you if you
[13:42] want if you're seeking the new birth if
[13:44] you're seeking any promise of God just
[13:46] wait wait on the Lord and try to try to
[13:47] jump jump forward and manufacture just
[13:49] wait and be of good courage and he shall
[13:51] strengthen thine heart
[13:53] weight I say on the Lord is what David
[13:55] said in Psalms be still and know that I
[13:58] am God that's what we've got inscribed
[14:00] over the little uh wood there above our
[14:03] heads just just just be still and wait
[14:06] and just just let the word begin to
[14:08] mature in the womb of your mind until it
[14:10] produces
[14:12] just wait on him be still and know that
[14:14] I am God I will be exalted among the
[14:16] Heathen I will be exalted in the earth
[14:18] if you'll wait and let it
[14:21] now if we just want to summarize some of
[14:23] the things that we've been kind of
[14:25] studying these are my notes on the left
[14:26] and then the things that brother Ram
[14:28] said on the right that when God promises
[14:30] something and you don't understand it
[14:32] just wait on him to bring the true
[14:34] interpretation because that's how so
[14:36] many people have gotten off the track is
[14:38] they try to oh well I I don't understand
[14:40] this so I'm just going to jump and we're
[14:41] gonna all of a sudden well now now we're
[14:44] we're in the Millennium I've been seeing
[14:46] that on Facebook all the time and it
[14:48] just
[14:51] if we're in the Millennium where's
[14:53] brother Brown at if we're in the
[14:55] Millennium I want to talk to the Saints
[14:57] I want to be able to if we're in the
[14:58] Millennium where's the where's the
[15:00] temple that the Jews are supposed to
[15:01] build and all the you know it just
[15:04] everything don't add up
[15:05] but but see you just it's because we
[15:07] don't they people don't we don't you
[15:10] know all of us all of us are guilty in
[15:11] some form or another we're just not
[15:13] waiting wait on the Lord and he'll bring
[15:15] the true interpretation
[15:16] failing to wait on God Satan is there to
[15:19] deceive just like Eve if you if you fail
[15:21] to wait you and you jump me try to try
[15:23] to try to get that with I'm going after
[15:25] wisdom I'm gonna I'm gonna be I want to
[15:27] know more than the next person I want to
[15:29] if you fail to wait on God Satan is
[15:32] right there ready to deceive you and
[15:33] what in your Pursuit yeah you want to
[15:35] know you want to know thing we all are
[15:38] here because we want to know but let's
[15:40] let's wait on God because he'll reveal
[15:42] it in his time
[15:43] the word of God is a seed that incubated
[15:46] if it's incubated in a believing mind
[15:48] it's going to bring forth life
[15:51] and Satan's lie when incubated in a
[15:54] doubting mind is going to bring forth a
[15:57] death
[15:59] now that's that's uh if you really think
[16:02] about that that's
[16:04] that'll answer a lot of questions
[16:06] and brother Adam said what is it the
[16:08] mind is the womb for the spirit what to
[16:10] take in or let out
[16:12] that's how they commit adultery is
[16:13] taking let some Satan devil Spirit
[16:15] putting them something against the word
[16:17] of God then she's committed adultery
[16:19] Eve received listen to this wrong seed
[16:22] word Satan's lie against Jehovah's work
[16:24] and the results was death
[16:27] and then again in another place he said
[16:28] when the Bride of Jesus Christ lets
[16:30] man-made Creeds and dog must take the
[16:32] place of the word of God
[16:34] she is committing adultery
[16:39] the spoken word is the Original Seed
[16:41] again he said now Jehovah had a bride
[16:43] once
[16:44] Adam had a bride Jesus had a bride
[16:46] Jehovah had a bride you know that he had
[16:48] to put her away she'd become a so
[16:50] he put her away that's exactly what he
[16:52] said she become a a prostitute
[16:55] it's interesting go you go back and
[16:57] listen to brother Ramon the spoken word
[16:58] is the Original Seed and it's like
[17:00] everybody just kind of draws back when
[17:02] he starts speaking Frank
[17:04] and I I I I kind of got I wanted to get
[17:07] up I wanted to be in that congregation
[17:09] and just encourage you preach it because
[17:12] you can tell everybody everybody's
[17:15] you know oh I don't know
[17:19] she become a prostitute what
[17:22] caused her to do that I wish we had time
[17:24] to read it I may get to some of it after
[17:25] a while
[17:27] right now it was in the time of Samuel
[17:29] when Israel had a king a God and she was
[17:31] a virgin she was going to produce
[17:33] something now look brother Ramos he's
[17:35] laying out for us how how how you can
[17:38] tell if the church or if a person is
[17:40] going off into spiritual adultery
[17:42] because what they do and instead of
[17:44] looking at the word they start looking
[17:45] at something else like Israel Israel had
[17:48] a promise of God and instead of looking
[17:50] at what they had that God had given them
[17:52] leadership and his spiritual leadership
[17:54] they started looking at something like
[17:56] well I'd rather be like that over there
[17:57] as soon as soon as uh a a young man or a
[18:02] young lady or somebody in the church
[18:03] soon as they start looking off at the
[18:05] world and say well I want to be like
[18:06] that oh that's that's dangerous
[18:08] territory God has given you the ability
[18:11] to live a holy Christian Life and and
[18:13] you start looking out well I I think I'd
[18:15] like to I wish I could do my hair like
[18:17] them I wish I could I wish I could put
[18:21] earrings in my ears and stuff and that's
[18:24] that's going off into that's exactly
[18:26] dangerous to territory
[18:28] he said he said she began to look around
[18:30] and see the other nations had Kings sure
[18:34] she wanted to be like the rest of them
[18:36] and he said you backwashed Pentecost
[18:39] that's exactly what you done that's a
[18:42] picture of what I got here that that
[18:44] that this is a Pentecostal church but
[18:47] now where God at one point wanted the
[18:49] Pentecostals to be uh the the the light
[18:52] of where he could he can manifest his
[18:54] power in in their services and speaking
[18:57] in tongues and moving to the spirit and
[18:59] God manifesting and now has turned into
[19:01] a big show like a circus almost where
[19:03] you come in and there's smoke machines
[19:05] and lice and glass pulpits and all of
[19:07] that kind of stuff but it's so different
[19:09] but why because they fail to wait on God
[19:12] and they ran and and and rushed and
[19:15] tried to manufacture something and
[19:16] looking off at the world to see if they
[19:18] could do something do something else see
[19:21] that where it all goes back to what they
[19:23] were talking about
[19:24] Cain and Abel Abel was based his his
[19:28] approach to God was based on a
[19:30] revelation and Cain was based on just
[19:33] intellectual understanding trying to
[19:35] manufacture something and not not being
[19:37] Wheeling to take God's provided away
[19:41] and the mark of the beast brother Brown
[19:43] said your heart is a wound
[19:46] you know what I'm speaking of women and
[19:48] men your heart as a womb and the womb
[19:49] holds the seed and the seed is the
[19:52] gospel now the seed alone in his heart
[19:54] no matter how many tomatoes you set
[19:56] under no matter how great your pasture
[19:58] is and how much you've read the Bible
[20:00] it'll never take life until the germ of
[20:04] life has come to it a woman's seed is a
[20:07] wonderful thing it's the building of a
[20:08] body but it has no life it can't it's
[20:10] impossible it has no life to begin with
[20:13] so no matter how much you know the Bible
[20:15] and how well it is in your heart you're
[20:18] still a sinner
[20:23] I'm trying to I hope these slides are in
[20:25] the right order
[20:28] I think that's kind of got a little bit
[20:29] older but anyway a baby's gonna grow in
[20:31] the womb and it's going to come forth
[20:34] so in the spoken word is the Original
[20:35] Seed he said this was both physical and
[20:37] spiritual with Eve
[20:39] both physical and spiritual
[20:41] mix mix into the the truth the truth and
[20:44] error mixing it up in the spiritual and
[20:46] the physical first and any time he said
[20:48] I told you and asked you this morning
[20:50] sisters to forgive me so I can mention
[20:52] that anytime that a woman takes the
[20:54] wrong step I'm talking about Crocs in
[20:56] the bride now but anytime a woman takes
[20:59] a wrong step she has to First receive it
[21:02] in her mind
[21:03] right some Slicker has to persuade her
[21:06] and she listens to it against her own
[21:08] better judgment then the ACT is
[21:11] committed
[21:12] so first it hit Satan hit Eve's mind and
[21:16] in the womb of her mind
[21:18] she doubted God's word then come the
[21:21] actual act and there's where you get you
[21:24] get finally there comes little babies
[21:26] and brother said whenever there's a
[21:27] Revival it always produces twins that's
[21:31] a rude remark but it's true when there
[21:32] was a birth out of from Isaac and
[21:34] Rebecca It produced twins when the world
[21:37] was created It produced twins two trees
[21:40] and when Kane and Abel were born It
[21:42] produced two it when Ishmael and Isaac
[21:44] was born they produced two and when Esau
[21:46] and Jacob was born It produced two one
[21:49] of them were natural
[21:51] one of them of the Earth the other one's
[21:54] Supernatural and one looked at the
[21:56] natural intellectual the other one
[21:59] walked by the spirit
[22:01] it's always been that way
[22:05] now
[22:07] we got we just got five more minutes I'm
[22:09] just gonna read a few more quotes before
[22:11] we close brother I'm sitting in the
[22:12] Ephesian Church Ace he said now though
[22:14] the word teaches us that if a woman
[22:16] leaves her husband and goes with another
[22:18] man
[22:19] she's an adulteress is no longer married
[22:22] and the husband is not to take her back
[22:24] that word was true and Eden as it was
[22:27] true when Moses wrote it in the law the
[22:30] word can't change now he's explaining
[22:33] where where why we believe that in Adam
[22:36] all die
[22:37] the word can't change Adam took her back
[22:41] he knew exactly what he was doing
[22:44] but he did it anyway
[22:46] she was a part of him and he was willing
[22:49] to take her responsibility upon himself
[22:51] he would not let her go so Eve conceived
[22:54] by him he knew she would
[22:56] he knew exactly what would happen to the
[22:58] human race and he sold the human race
[23:01] into sin that he might have Eve or he
[23:03] loved her and those and so those two
[23:06] sons were born
[23:07] sons that will be the fathers of the
[23:10] human race that was even now polluted
[23:14] now you think about you think about the
[23:16] situation just if we could you remember
[23:18] just meditate on the story this story is
[23:21] so rich
[23:22] think about the situation that Adam was
[23:24] in that he that even come out of his
[23:26] side she was part of him she was flesh
[23:28] of his flesh and bone of his bone and
[23:30] spirit of his Spirit the same and he and
[23:33] he's looking at her and she's made this
[23:34] she's made this mistake and now he's
[23:36] he's like he's he's he wants to be able
[23:39] to go and and Redeemer but it's just not
[23:42] in him it was in Christ it's in Christ
[23:44] to go out and and take on our sin and
[23:48] die on the cross and redeem us back to
[23:50] himself but it wasn't in him so it's
[23:51] like Adam Adam tried to do it and he and
[23:54] he got stuck in the mud he got he's got
[23:57] covered in the filth and couldn't get
[23:58] back
[23:59] So Adam he knew going into it he knew
[24:02] the situation that was going to result
[24:05] from him going and and go going out with
[24:08] Eve he knew the predicament that it was
[24:10] going to put the human race in
[24:12] he knew that it was gonna it what was
[24:15] gonna happen and he went and did it now
[24:18] look where brother I'm said in a spoken
[24:19] word is the Original Seed she got in a
[24:21] hurry and what did she do she crossed
[24:24] her seed she mingled it with the serpent
[24:26] seat and what when she did she brought
[24:29] on what did she bring she brought a
[24:31] child of death now see Adam knew this
[24:34] was going to happen a child that she
[24:36] perverted every child after that
[24:40] now now these are some weighty quotes
[24:42] because you start realizing that this is
[24:44] maybe different than a lot of people in
[24:45] the message believe they uh
[24:48] well let's let's just read the quotes he
[24:52] said what was that what was the seed of
[24:54] the serpent adultery you follow it
[24:57] adultery with Eve what happened to that
[24:59] what brought that forth and adultery
[25:01] another synonym for that is infidelity
[25:03] infidelity is the breaking of a promise
[25:07] in James chapter 4 and we will we'll
[25:10] close on this maybe James Chad from when
[25:13] it's come Wars and fighting is among you
[25:15] come they not hints even of your lusts
[25:17] that war and your members ye lust and
[25:20] have not you killed and desire to have
[25:22] and cannot obtain you fight and War yet
[25:24] you have not because you ask not ye ask
[25:26] and receive not because you ask a miss
[25:28] that ye may consume it upon your lusts
[25:31] he's talking about lust now the
[25:33] adulterers and adulteresses know you not
[25:36] that the Friendship of the world is
[25:38] enmity with God whosoever therefore will
[25:41] be a friend of the world is the enemy of
[25:43] God and brother Brown said in the
[25:45] programian church age he said
[25:47] and what is it spoke of here in the
[25:49] church the spiritual adultery spiritual
[25:51] adulteries when you're you profess to be
[25:53] a Christian and you're still living like
[25:55] the world you're you're instead of
[25:57] looking at what God promised you're
[25:59] looking off at the world looking at all
[26:02] the things the world offers in first
[26:05] John it says love not the world neither
[26:07] the things that are in the world if any
[26:08] man love the world the love of the
[26:10] father is not even any
[26:11] for all that is in the world the lust of
[26:14] the flesh and the lust of the eyes and
[26:16] the pride of life is not of the father
[26:19] but is of the world
[26:20] and the world passeth away and the lust
[26:22] thereof but he that doeth the will of
[26:25] God forever abideth forever and and I
[26:28] said we're going to close on that slide
[26:29] but we'll close on this bless what
[26:31] balaam's teaching was to get the people
[26:33] off looking away from the promise of God
[26:36] and to to think that it just don't
[26:39] matter it don't really matter what you
[26:40] believe and start looking at at at
[26:44] Moab and and like brother Raymond said
[26:46] the hair and the biscuit where they came
[26:48] from and they wanted to be to try to be
[26:51] like Moab and where they come from
[26:53] instead of the promises of God Balaam is
[26:56] preaching
[26:57] was that we're all the same but brother
[27:00] Raymond said in the anointing ones at
[27:01] the end time we are not the same we're
[27:03] not the same
