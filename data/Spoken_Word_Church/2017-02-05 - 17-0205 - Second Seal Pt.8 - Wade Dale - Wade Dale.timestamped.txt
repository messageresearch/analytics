[0:00] what'd I just say I didn't listen that's
[0:03] what I figured that's a good one and I
[0:06] saw when the lamb opened one of the
[0:07] seals and I heard it was a noise of
[0:08] Thunder one of the four beasts saying
[0:10] come and see I saw him be held a white
[0:12] horse and he that sat on him had a bowl
[0:13] and the crown was given unto him went
[0:15] forth conquering and to conquer now
[0:18] remember that was the first seal that
[0:19] was the white horse rider that was that
[0:21] white righteous church and then we see
[0:24] though the symbolics that we have to
[0:26] take
[0:27] the revelation of those seals
[0:31] is the seven Thunders that John didn't
[0:33] write
[0:34] is that are we getting out yes she said
[0:38] boy that's not in there
[0:42] okay well if if somebody check on it Bob
[0:45] who just come in well
[0:48] no oh okay
[0:51] um if you want mine just go straight in
[0:53] there until he gets there and if he
[0:55] doesn't get there then I'll deal with
[0:57] that later when he had opened the second
[0:59] seal I heard the second beast they come
[1:01] and see so we're the first seal was
[1:04] we saw white righteous church we saw
[1:07] um all these things that happened in the
[1:10] natural form right
[1:13] but then we come and brought the layer
[1:15] of the onion peel back again and we
[1:16] peeled a little more of the onion off
[1:18] and felt that it had a spiritual
[1:19] application for you and I right right
[1:22] and that's something that we got to
[1:24] catch because the Written Letter has not
[1:26] changed one person yet okay so we're
[1:29] looking at the between the lines what
[1:32] God is saying to us
[1:34] and we know that the prophet of God
[1:35] spent
[1:36] that last three and a half years of his
[1:38] message
[1:39] trying to explain the seals because the
[1:43] seals you can't preach the seals in six
[1:45] six nine seven nines eight nines
[1:48] it had to be a development of time all
[1:51] the way through to bring the message out
[1:54] all right
[1:55] because remember even when we get in the
[1:57] seventh seal he said it opened in a
[1:59] threefold Marin they didn't all open on
[2:01] the same day that's right right and
[2:03] there was one unknown which we know that
[2:05] when he preached Christ the mystery God
[2:06] revealed that he brought all the seals
[2:08] together
[2:09] and showed Christ a mystery of God
[2:13] it said he said revealed so if it's
[2:16] revealed it's revealed right yes okay
[2:20] so we know that it was revealed through
[2:22] the ministry of William Branham not just
[2:24] one sermon or two or three or four all
[2:27] right and you say well do you throw away
[2:30] 47 no
[2:33] 47 to 63 is the foundation of the house
[2:36] you're building
[2:38] 47 to 1963 was a work of restoration we
[2:42] talked about it last night
[2:43] that was a work of restoration brother
[2:45] Brown didn't come to Branson you Holy
[2:47] Ghost he didn't even tell us how to live
[2:48] right
[2:50] he wasn't the first one to tell us how
[2:51] to live right the Bible already told us
[2:53] how to live right what we had done is
[2:55] man had just put their hand over it and
[2:57] took their own revelation of it so man
[2:59] had closed the book back
[3:02] so we see now that the book in
[3:04] Revelations 10 7 that the mighty Angel
[3:07] comes down with the book open all right
[3:09] yeah so he opened the book and he
[3:10] revealed what the seven sealed not just
[3:14] not just in I say eight sermons because
[3:17] remember he preached the questions and
[3:19] answers
[3:21] um
[3:21] and truly that that's not a mistake
[3:25] um brother Dale's preached it many times
[3:27] and I've attempted it a few times that
[3:29] there's always an interval between six
[3:31] and seven right you have six seals and
[3:33] then you have an interval you have six
[3:35] you have six Church ages and then
[3:37] there's an interval that's Pentecostal
[3:38] age that we were talking about there's
[3:40] an interval in there that always came
[3:41] himself then you got six trumpets then
[3:44] there's a Chapter whole chapter inserted
[3:47] in between that so we see that the same
[3:49] thing happened now he's between the
[3:51] sixth and the seventh seal brother round
[3:52] stopped on the sixth sale had questions
[3:54] and answers the next morning then he
[3:56] preached the seventh seal that night so
[3:58] there's always a gap or an interval
[4:00] to want to I think it's to catch
[4:02] everything up to bring everything up and
[4:04] kind of do a summation of the six
[4:06] because it's really only six seals
[4:08] right because Christ is the seven he
[4:10] preached six seals in Matthew 24 he
[4:12] didn't preached seven the seventh was
[4:14] standing there if they would have known
[4:16] that son of man who he was then they
[4:18] would have known that was The Headstone
[4:20] but they didn't know they knew he was
[4:22] the Cornerstone because he said he was
[4:24] you know the Bible of course when I say
[4:26] he he wrote the Bible okay so the Bible
[4:28] said that amen
[4:32] for winning it opened now the second
[4:34] seal we've been on it
[4:36] come and see another horse that was red
[4:40] power was giving him a settlement to
[4:42] take peace from the earth and that they
[4:43] should kill one another and they've
[4:44] given him a great story
[4:45] all right so now
[4:47] we've showed the work of what the odds
[4:52] he was given a sword or a word
[4:54] the red was blood and then Sanctified
[4:57] and we wrote body in there because
[5:00] we are to be Sanctified daily
[5:03] in our walk with God now we're going to
[5:05] read some about sanctification in the
[5:07] Bible so excuse me the second seal to me
[5:12] shows the first deal shows one true Lamb
[5:15] of God the second seal and even right up
[5:18] to the fourth seal shows us how our
[5:20] Redemption comes because remember the
[5:23] Rapture takes place on the fourth seal
[5:26] all right everybody got there after it
[5:29] takes place on the fourth still why
[5:31] there's no more there's no more uh line
[5:34] Ox Manor Eagle there's no more horse
[5:36] riders there's no more uh there's
[5:39] honestly there's no more holding up for
[5:41] the Gentiles that's right
[5:43] once the door of the Gentile church is
[5:45] closed there's not nothing going to be
[5:46] saved so them four horse riders that
[5:48] help us out the wine Ops man and Eagle
[5:50] is the Holy Ghost for your age and it's
[5:52] going to go because brother Ryan will
[5:53] tell you in the fifth sealed he said we
[5:55] know that the Raptor takes place in the
[5:56] force Hill because we don't see any
[5:58] horse riders anymore we don't see any
[5:59] beasts anymore
[6:00] so therefore
[6:02] the church had to take a Rapture you say
[6:04] well what's five six and seven if you
[6:07] don't get five six and seven you don't
[6:08] go out and four
[6:10] minutes that's a little confusing but
[6:12] you think about it
[6:14] if you don't get five six and seven to
[6:16] me five six and seven is the Apex are
[6:19] the uh the the change of the body the
[6:22] the culmination and we'll look at that
[6:25] because you got to break them back into
[6:26] one two three and four because we all
[6:28] got a break down here that's right okay
[6:31] but the Rapture take place on the four
[6:33] seal people go Haywire but we're that's
[6:35] why we're here so we can all learn
[6:37] together and when brother Brown does say
[6:39] that you don't you know war in your mind
[6:42] you say well five six and sevens to the
[6:43] Jews
[6:45] listen if we don't get the seventh seal
[6:47] broke here on the earth we're gonna take
[6:49] a body change because the seventh seal
[6:50] himself is the one that took a body
[6:52] change right right so if we have the son
[6:55] of man ministry that's what I'm trying
[6:56] to tell you you know the last few
[6:58] Sundays that son of man Ministry is if
[7:00] it if it's here I'm asking you that I
[7:02] know it is but if that Sunland Ministry
[7:04] is here it's got to act the same way it
[7:06] acted when the flesh man was standing
[7:09] here on Earth got to if not then we go
[7:12] back to the church ages to where
[7:14] well is it this or is there two or is it
[7:17] three or is it baptism and father son or
[7:19] is it this or if that or or now come up
[7:21] to the message where we see now the
[7:23] message is breaking the word apart
[7:25] the people in the so-called message
[7:27] breaking the word apart right right
[7:29] um
[7:31] number one they killed the influence of
[7:33] the messenger
[7:34] so the whole message is wrong my brother
[7:36] that was talking about last night if you
[7:38] can discredit brother around being out
[7:39] there when they when the cloud came
[7:41] versus what they wrote in Life Magazine
[7:44] then your number one calling him a liar
[7:46] number two you're saying that that never
[7:47] happened right the day was never met by
[7:50] any angel or met by any thing and that
[7:53] he's just making up this story yeah
[7:58] well I said it it it's uh
[8:00] it's it's
[8:02] [Music]
[8:06] I just don't understand but but you
[8:08] won't under you won't understand
[8:11] you want to understand
[8:13] if you don't have logo
[8:15] okay that's right there's some things
[8:16] you won't be able to see
[8:18] but we've come to a development now to
[8:21] where everything's got to be faster
[8:23] everything's accelerated we're learning
[8:26] more we should be to the fact of where
[8:27] when brother Dale comes out today and
[8:29] brings out what he's going to bring out
[8:31] we should be able to now whether we see
[8:33] it or not or understand it right at the
[8:35] moment that's okay but you see where
[8:38] that has to happen there's things has to
[8:40] happen to go in place right amen so um
[8:44] just like I said when I when I preached
[8:46] out about 1977
[8:49] um
[8:50] we got to look at a marker because I was
[8:53] thinking last night because some had
[8:54] said well okay go past 20 swings it's
[8:57] going to go past 2026. do you know that
[8:59] time still continues until until the
[9:02] lights are on judgment so if we say if
[9:05] 2026 or 27 when the world's destroyed
[9:08] right the the millenniums ushered in
[9:11] it's going to be 30 26 Before Time ends
[9:14] so time's going to continue on out but
[9:18] there are there's a place to where
[9:20] that's why that that I think that God
[9:22] says okay I'm going to let this thing
[9:23] run but I'm going to pick a bribe
[9:25] remember he comes as a thief in the
[9:26] night I'm gonna put I'm going to pick a
[9:29] bride up right out of that and let it
[9:31] just continue on and brother Brown said
[9:33] they'll even keep going to church
[9:34] thinking they're getting the Holy Ghost
[9:36] thinking the words being preached to
[9:38] them now that's message people too
[9:40] that's right right yeah
[9:43] so there must be something real secret
[9:44] about it I mean because everybody in the
[9:47] Bronx look at everybody sorry everybody
[9:48] in the message is looking for a Rapture
[9:50] that's right soon
[9:53] you know denominations can put it off
[9:55] and I know sometimes we have that
[9:56] thought of putting it off it ain't gonna
[9:57] happen in my time but uh I think we're
[10:01] supposed to call for it I thought Israel
[10:02] called for
[10:04] um a redeemer to get them out of Israel
[10:06] I don't think they were going well I
[10:07] think we'll just be another 34 years I
[10:10] kind of like it here no
[10:12] but you know what we do like it here and
[10:14] that's why we do have a problem with
[10:15] dates and times and season yes that's
[10:17] right and and we get unsettled
[10:20] but why should we be unsettled this is
[10:22] not our home this is not where we're
[10:24] supposed to this is not the condition
[10:25] that we're supposed to be in so what's
[10:28] inside of us should be yearning for
[10:30] something else right that's just my
[10:32] whole and listen we're all humans that's
[10:33] right sorry we're all humans we we don't
[10:36] want to leave the comfort of our home or
[10:38] leave the comfort of our car leave the
[10:40] comfort of our job but one day folks
[10:42] brother Brown said your job will mean
[10:44] nothing that's right that's nothing
[10:46] that's right and I've been reading and
[10:49] I'm going to bring it out now brother
[10:50] now's going to preach this afternoon
[10:51] because of I really appreciate what he's
[10:53] bringing
[10:54] about the the dates and what's coming up
[10:57] that that's proven by the 6 000 years
[11:00] and the 3 000 years is give to the Jews
[11:03] so I told him listen I didn't allow him
[11:07] to preach he's allowing me to preach on
[11:08] the afternoon I just give it back to him
[11:10] for a while I wanted him to finish it so
[11:12] he wouldn't have to review so much next
[11:14] Sunday yeah because you in seven days
[11:16] you'll miss
[11:17] yeah and brother now so gracious to go
[11:19] back and review well well we're going to
[11:21] get a double barrel today of him so but
[11:24] I've been reading in the scripture where
[11:25] Jesus said I didn't come to bring peace
[11:27] that's right he said I come to bring
[11:29] division between mother and father
[11:32] sister brother mother-in-law
[11:34] sister-in-law he brought it all the way
[11:36] down and he said if you don't take up
[11:37] your cross and follow me he said you're
[11:39] not of me that's right you think Jesus
[11:41] was some soft-spoken I don't think so
[11:48] Liars your father's different than mine
[11:52] he told that one man he said go tell
[11:54] that fox yeah talking about Harry Harry
[11:57] they told him to be they told him to
[11:59] beware of Herod because he was he was
[12:01] you know kind of he was he pulled a
[12:03] quick deal and that's what Jesus said
[12:05] hey look at that little fox I ain't
[12:06] worried about him I ain't worried about
[12:08] him right but that's what we've come
[12:10] under now this is what we've come under
[12:12] where where we see that every message is
[12:15] important everything's important
[12:17] um
[12:18] the sales are important
[12:20] um
[12:22] the
[12:24] the 1970 weeks all that is really a
[12:26] foundation yes to raise us up into this
[12:30] I think the most glorious message in in
[12:33] the world because no one listen when we
[12:36] excuse me when we get up there to the
[12:38] other side
[12:40] John saw this and wrote it but he didn't
[12:42] understand it
[12:43] no one
[12:45] you understand what I'm saying no one on
[12:48] this Earth
[12:50] except the last day bride of Jesus
[12:52] Christ and William Branham understands
[12:54] the seal no one that's right no one
[12:57] fully understood it exactly
[13:01] right but what a great thing now we can
[13:03] understand it if we if brother Brown
[13:05] said the rapping Faith lives in the
[13:07] books and cakes and we got to get in
[13:08] them and uh
[13:11] let it be part of our life yes is that
[13:13] all right
[13:15] so that's our commission our commission
[13:17] is to take a body change not to give it
[13:18] to another not to give it to another age
[13:20] that's right there is no other age
[13:23] that's right we're either going down or
[13:26] up no continuation down or up one of
[13:29] them all right there's no I think I'll
[13:32] just stay neutral no yeah
[13:34] like Jesus said he said yeah the kingdom
[13:36] of God's taken by force
[13:38] you got to take it it's yours he said
[13:41] the kingdom of God if you'll really read
[13:43] in the Bible Matthew Mark Luke and John
[13:45] the daily life of Jesus
[13:47] you'll see how they had a problem with
[13:50] him being the son of man because they
[13:52] did not understand they knew that there
[13:53] was Jehovah God that was so pure that
[13:55] nobody can understand that he was so
[13:57] high that he would come down in a cloud
[13:59] and he'd have to speak through uh you
[14:01] know Moses or something you know and
[14:03] there was a large separation
[14:07] so Jesus comes down here and he just
[14:09] acts like the rest of them really
[14:11] they called him a wine beaver a glutton
[14:13] he must like to eat and drink wine
[14:16] right that you know he said you call me
[14:18] that
[14:19] and then they called him belzebub
[14:21] so
[14:23] did I am I saying he lived a horrible
[14:25] life no he lived this life that we're
[14:27] supposed to live but he was the most UN
[14:29] misunderstood person that ever was on
[14:31] the face of this Earth
[14:33] so we should be the most misunderstood
[14:35] people on the face of the Earth how do
[14:37] we can live a good life and live a good
[14:39] full Christian Life
[14:41] but yet be the son of man made manifest
[14:44] in the end time
[14:45] amen all right
[14:48] without the without the um
[14:52] the the great signs and wonders in one
[14:54] person
[14:55] right and one person it's not gonna be
[14:57] in one person anymore so it's going to
[14:58] be individually
[15:00] to just make it through this age you and
[15:03] I are going to have to have
[15:04] that same Ministry inside of us to get
[15:07] through because that's what got Jesus
[15:08] Through amen and got him through the
[15:11] through the world now the world wasn't
[15:13] near as bad then as it is now that's
[15:14] right
[15:16] I mean all the demons were after Jesus
[15:18] because there wasn't no other Holy Ghost
[15:19] people so then we go after
[15:22] but now
[15:24] you got all this multiplication of God
[15:25] and and you know Satan's trying his best
[15:27] to get it back down you know to get it
[15:30] back down again but he's not going to be
[15:32] able to
[15:33] because we do take a Rapture that's why
[15:35] I want you to see today we do take a
[15:37] Rapture in the four seal so there is
[15:39] something going to happen to a group of
[15:40] people that's right they're going to
[15:42] lift off this Earth but we're not going
[15:44] to lift off this Earth without some One
[15:46] Two Three or ten or a hundred people
[15:47] gonna have to stand one day and say this
[15:50] is them that's right because I want to
[15:52] show you something about sanctification
[15:53] just in this form that we haven't seen
[15:57] that we have scriptures we haven't read
[15:58] so we know that that we see that
[16:02] in the church ages the first three Ages
[16:04] was the first seal right the lion the
[16:08] lion of the tribe of Judah the boldness
[16:10] of God all the there was no denomination
[16:13] in this age right they were forming once
[16:17] right
[16:18] remember it was the same
[16:20] then it become a deed then it became a
[16:22] doctor amen then it becomes incarnate in
[16:24] the person all right so the same way
[16:26] here we see that this was you know they
[16:28] didn't teach three gods or water baptism
[16:31] father son Holy Ghost only till 606 A.D
[16:34] at the 19 Council did they start
[16:36] converting people that's why they had a
[16:39] hard time this age is the ox age of
[16:42] Colombia they were killed because they
[16:44] were called they were Christians
[16:46] just to be a Christian brother Brown
[16:48] said you knew you were going to
[16:49] automatically die right kind of horrible
[16:51] but that's the way it was
[16:53] okay because they pulled away from the
[16:55] Catholic church but the Catholic Church
[16:57] became so much in power
[16:59] they killed 68 million Jews or 16
[17:01] million Jews 68 million Protestants
[17:04] and that same devil killed 6.8 million
[17:06] Jews in the Holocaust so it's the same
[17:08] one but that's where you get your red
[17:11] blood and what was what was God doing he
[17:14] was sanctifying a group of people
[17:17] okay all right because I believe the
[17:19] Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be
[17:20] saved
[17:21] all right now that won't work in this
[17:24] age to the fullness you hear when I say
[17:26] it to the fullness that won't work in
[17:28] this age because being justified
[17:30] will not put you in the body now but see
[17:33] but but God has moved up right the
[17:35] word's been opened more
[17:37] well the forward's been opened we just
[17:39] got to get we just got to quit closing
[17:41] the book God keeps opening it we keep
[17:43] closing it okay so the second seal now
[17:46] let's read
[17:47] John 17 and watch what Jesus said
[17:55] John 17 17.
[18:01] [Applause]
[18:03] sanctify them through thy truth
[18:06] what is truth
[18:08] that word okay that's what I'm going to
[18:12] preach on next Sunday is it's not that
[18:14] but it's going to be show us the father
[18:16] that was his whole deal of being on the
[18:19] Earth was to show the father not show
[18:21] himself right
[18:23] so that's what me see that's when we
[18:26] when we interject you in it or you when
[18:28] you point your point your fingers
[18:30] yourself when you interject you in it
[18:32] you're not showing the father right
[18:34] right so that's what he done he came to
[18:36] do thy will
[18:37] father if it be thy will let this cup
[18:40] pass for me but nevertheless
[18:42] thou will be done see Mary even said the
[18:45] same thing Mary yielded and said thy
[18:46] will be done in other words what you
[18:47] said that's what's going to happen
[18:49] how simple is that but she accepted it
[18:52] with no
[18:53] there was no stipulation in there okay
[18:55] sanctify them through that truth that
[18:57] word is true now that word sanctify
[19:01] in the strong
[19:04] means to make holy
[19:09] to purify or consecrate
[19:12] to venerate or Hollow
[19:15] be holy be holy sanctify all right to
[19:19] render or acknowledge or to be venerable
[19:21] or hallow to separate from profane
[19:24] things and dedicate to God consecrate
[19:27] things to God dedicate people to God
[19:31] to purify cleanse externally
[19:34] now we know that externally
[19:37] you can't clean yourself up enough
[19:42] [Music]
[19:42] um
[19:43] so you got to do what she says to purify
[19:46] internally by renewing of the Soul so
[19:49] that the outside person can be clean
[19:51] right I I want to really get on that one
[19:54] day that that we always point to this
[19:58] but really are we pointing to this this
[20:01] flesh we know it came born in sin shape
[20:04] and iniquity had to come here that way
[20:06] yes because of the fall but is it really
[20:09] dirty
[20:11] as far as God says dirty I thought we
[20:14] was going to live in a flesh body for
[20:16] eternity
[20:18] right right I thought that's what we're
[20:20] going to live in
[20:21] that's what I was talking about Sunday
[20:22] about the glorified body when John when
[20:24] when when Jesus reeks down and touched
[20:26] John down uh alapapolis and he was
[20:29] preaching he touched John with his right
[20:31] hand he touched him with a glorified
[20:32] body
[20:33] in other words I've got a glorified body
[20:35] and I'm going to give you glorified body
[20:37] it's just not going to come till the
[20:38] church ages are over but I'm going to
[20:40] give you one in other words he didn't
[20:42] have a problem listen yeah I don't think
[20:43] he got that Sunday he didn't have a
[20:45] problem touching that flesh man of John
[20:47] okay
[20:49] he didn't go over there and go now John
[20:51] you're dirty
[20:52] that's right the Bible said he took his
[20:54] right hand
[20:55] and laid it on John
[20:58] he didn't have a problem with connecting
[21:00] to the flesh our problem and I'll read
[21:03] it next Sunday Jesus said our problem is
[21:05] not what goes in
[21:07] where art comes out
[21:09] it's what proceeds from here out that's
[21:13] right so what is it your vocal cords
[21:16] don't say one thing unless your soul and
[21:18] spirit tells what it tell you what to do
[21:19] your body don't do once your body does
[21:22] not sin
[21:24] everybody says no we sin in our bodies
[21:26] let's not well if we thought that for 50
[21:29] something years and it hadn't worked
[21:30] let's start thinking other ways
[21:32] you don't sin with your body okay
[21:35] your body is just an uh a capsule that
[21:39] you're sowing your spirits in
[21:41] that's right is that right
[21:43] right your body don't sin unless what's
[21:46] inside of it tells it what to do that's
[21:48] right so who's doing this in it
[21:51] that's right that's Spirit realm that
[21:53] Spirit realm is the hardest thing to get
[21:57] Hey Brother the hardest thing to get rid
[21:59] of and you can't get rid of it you got
[22:01] to clean it up because watch he said you
[22:03] sanctify From the Inside Out go ahead
[22:05] yes sir no I was going to say that you
[22:07] can take that in the physical for
[22:09] example
[22:10] um
[22:11] anything that you might have on your
[22:13] skin for example acne let's just say
[22:15] acne acne is not an issue of the outside
[22:18] of of the skin itself it's actually
[22:20] something from from within right and
[22:24] that's what doctors would say you know
[22:26] right anything that comes out on the
[22:28] outside is just showing that something's
[22:29] wrong inside right therefore do
[22:31] something inside in order for the skin
[22:33] to stop showing whatever right you can
[22:35] take that that way too you know in the
[22:37] spiritual you know but if the soul is
[22:39] right is wrong the outside is going to
[22:42] be wrong yeah you're gonna have swords
[22:44] and that's why leprosy is a type of sin
[22:47] a top you know it's not it's not sin in
[22:50] itself
[22:53] right right
[22:54] but it is a it signifies because it
[22:58] comes from the body comes from whatever
[22:59] happens to the person that has leprosy
[23:02] yes so I I don't want us to say well
[23:05] well I'm sinless but
[23:09] Paul's already told us
[23:12] that we're already raptured sitting in
[23:14] Heavenly places in our soul right
[23:17] now if you get a cut on your hand
[23:22] does it heal back up
[23:24] yes
[23:26] the problem our problem is is when God
[23:29] cursed the ground everything we eat that
[23:31] comes out of the ground is what's cursed
[23:32] so our soul didn't come out of the
[23:34] ground our spirit didn't come out of the
[23:36] ground no all right our body came out of
[23:38] the ground right that's the problem is
[23:39] that we live under a sand curve but are
[23:42] we Sinners because we're in flesh bodies
[23:46] I don't think so we're not Sinners
[23:48] because we're in flesh bodies we're
[23:50] Sinners because the inside person is not
[23:52] being cleaned or Sanctified that's right
[23:57] that's one day we're going to stand on
[23:59] people and we're going to realize what's
[24:00] already inside of us if you're born
[24:02] again and you have these virtues working
[24:04] in your life and The Headstone is
[24:06] revealed to you
[24:08] you're just as Eternal as God is and
[24:10] God's just going to change your body
[24:11] brother Brown said what what is this
[24:14] great chain all you gotta just a change
[24:18] so he said just change
[24:21] so we're looking for something I think
[24:22] that's
[24:23] that's
[24:26] already there
[24:28] we're looking for something out there
[24:29] that's going to get this thing better we
[24:31] know this thing's dying we know it
[24:33] stinks we know it if we don't take care
[24:35] of it it will
[24:37] Rock and it is still rotting but
[24:41] these seals to me instead of just
[24:44] showing that I'm Sanctified on the
[24:45] inside I've got to start believing and
[24:48] confessing
[24:49] because remember
[24:51] Jesus never never he never in all four
[24:55] chapters he never said oh this wretched
[24:58] body that I live in no yeah
[25:00] yeah did he no no
[25:02] he knew he was brought subject to the to
[25:05] the to the sin of the world because he
[25:07] knew he was getting older right I mean
[25:09] he was in his 30s and looked 50. there's
[25:11] no denying that but he never once
[25:14] oh Father I'm sorry that you had to put
[25:16] me in this human body oh Lord why did
[25:19] you put me in Father why'd you he never
[25:21] said that he never denied
[25:24] why he was there but he never
[25:26] belittled his flesh
[25:28] because that's what they're asking me
[25:30] we'll read it next Sunday they said oh
[25:31] what's this and this and this he said
[25:33] why are you worried about what you're
[25:34] eating oh I know what it is because the
[25:36] Pharisees and we don't get anywhere
[25:38] today the Pharisees come to him and said
[25:43] your disciples eat without washing their
[25:45] hands right
[25:48] they're eaten with unclean ham
[25:50] Jesus said it ain't what's on the
[25:52] outside right you see it he said there's
[25:54] what's on the inside that's right that's
[25:56] right it comes out he said in other
[25:58] words he didn't go now y'all disciples
[25:59] y'all go bring this wash your hands
[26:01] that's right no he never said that he
[26:03] just belittled the Pharisees for looking
[26:05] at the little things
[26:07] and you know and they went through one
[26:08] day and ate the corn on the Sabbath day
[26:11] they didn't go Harvest it they walked
[26:14] through the field and picked it and ate
[26:15] it
[26:18] that's what I'm saying this way if you
[26:20] look from this way back that way you go
[26:22] well he was profaning the Sabbath
[26:25] but he wasn't there is no law that you
[26:27] can't eat on the Sabbath you just can't
[26:29] go out and harvest it on the Sabbath and
[26:31] they weren't harvesting they were eating
[26:33] and as they were walking through the
[26:34] field right you remember back in Ruth
[26:36] and Boaz the Bible's perfect amen they
[26:38] always left the corner of the fields
[26:40] right
[26:41] remember that's what Ruth was doing she
[26:43] was leaning in the corner they would cut
[26:45] their field and they cut it in a circle
[26:46] but they'd leave those corners for the
[26:49] poor and the people coming through the
[26:51] Wayfair The Stranger coming through they
[26:52] leave and that's what somebody had done
[26:54] they had left the cornfield
[26:56] when the corners not cut and they were
[26:59] going through eating the corn because
[27:00] they were hungry Jesus said have you not
[27:03] read that David
[27:05] actually went in the temple that's right
[27:07] he went in it now he didn't go in in the
[27:09] holy of holies he went in that second
[27:11] Court though
[27:13] and ate the shoe bread that was in the
[27:15] bowl him and his Warriors yes yes and I
[27:18] bet they didn't wash their hands either
[27:19] no but Jesus was telling him says well
[27:22] are you straining tonight and swallow a
[27:23] camel you know you're right right so
[27:26] what I'm saying is is I believe this the
[27:28] message of the hour
[27:31] we'll listen we'll never deny that this
[27:34] thing we live in is dying we know it is
[27:37] but now if your soul was born again it's
[27:38] not
[27:40] it never did die never have I never will
[27:42] die that's right never will get older
[27:44] never will sin never will say anything
[27:46] wrong it's in that Spirit realm of what
[27:48] we go to work with
[27:49] right
[27:51] memory reason conscious affection you
[27:53] write them five down and look at them
[27:55] every day and you say there's my enemy
[27:57] that's right yeah it's my memory my
[27:59] conscience of who I am and the and the
[28:01] devil telling me who I am that's right
[28:03] reasoning
[28:05] imagination there's no imagination in
[28:07] God that's right
[28:09] and then the love or or or that that we
[28:13] know that that's not the love of God
[28:14] love God's in the soul is your faith or
[28:16] doubt that's right right brother Brian
[28:18] said you love with your spirit that's
[28:19] what he's saying right but we got to
[28:21] take that spirit that we love with that
[28:23] we you say oh I love this I love to eat
[28:25] I love it most unused word in the world
[28:29] because true agape love is is the love
[28:31] of God and nothing else feel your love
[28:34] is what we have for our family and our
[28:35] children and our life and all that for
[28:37] the for the natural world
[28:39] and and I believe that was set up
[28:41] because of the of the dimensions when
[28:43] God separated himself in Genesis 3 15 he
[28:45] said I'll put him into your division
[28:48] dimension
[28:49] between me and you but I'm going to make
[28:52] a way because I'm going to come through
[28:53] all them come down here as a baby and
[28:56] I'm going to come back as the woman's
[28:58] seed and I'm going to bring you right
[28:59] back here in that Redemption Redemption
[29:01] is not replacement it's not going back
[29:03] to another Garden it's going right back
[29:05] position
[29:06] all right so let's just start thinking
[29:09] that don't and listen
[29:10] fine line though you can't walk around
[29:12] and say I'm so perfect I can't do
[29:14] anything wrong
[29:17] or we're in the Millennium and all that
[29:19] stuff that people are preaching now
[29:21] let's let's don't do that
[29:23] I know that I'm a sinner saved by grace
[29:26] but if I'm saved I ain't necessary no
[29:27] more
[29:29] right right
[29:30] [Music]
[29:34] we're going to see that our problem is
[29:36] not in our flesh
[29:37] My Flesh has no problem at all
[29:40] it just holds everything it's inside
[29:43] that inside of me is what I got to work
[29:45] on that's true that thing that starts
[29:47] running around in my brain
[29:49] call my reasoning yeah right my
[29:52] consciousness of things
[29:54] sure we're supposed to be Sanctified but
[29:57] watch let's read this right here
[29:58] Ephesians 5 let's go to verse 19 right
[30:01] here and for their sakes I sanctify
[30:04] myself
[30:05] that they also may be might be
[30:07] Sanctified what through the truth so the
[30:10] truth is the only thing now listen
[30:13] let's stop right there
[30:15] the truth
[30:17] has nothing to do with your body
[30:20] your body is false already it's contrary
[30:24] right yes it's contrary because it came
[30:27] the wrong way right
[30:29] but through the truth of what's inside
[30:33] I just believe one day it's going to be
[30:35] one day we're gonna just
[30:37] say the prince of this world is coming
[30:39] has nothing nothing in me oh sure you
[30:42] say well I had this bad dog come on
[30:46] if Jesus listen if Jesus was so human
[30:50] that brother Brown said he was tempted
[30:52] then what how is the temptation
[30:54] it's not from this
[30:56] this fulfills the Temptation you
[30:59] understand this fulfills the Temptation
[31:00] that's right what is the Temptation your
[31:04] memory
[31:06] Jesus was tempted with women so the
[31:08] tempter would come but he didn't
[31:11] entertain that thought that's right
[31:14] that's our problem we entertain that
[31:16] thought if you just say
[31:17] don't worry about that let's don't worry
[31:19] about that all right let's go
[31:22] let's go to Ephesians 5
[31:25] 26. I want to see this fish is good
[31:27] right here
[31:32] everybody all right don't don't say
[31:35] brother Dale
[31:36] bro Wade tells you that you can do
[31:38] anything in the world in your flesh you
[31:40] know
[31:41] no but I'm telling you that whatever you
[31:43] do ain't your flesh that's right
[31:47] why were we given this body
[31:52] we solve it
[31:54] right
[31:57] you don't hear my soul knocking on there
[31:59] but my soul's inside of there telling me
[32:02] to do that that's true right right okay
[32:05] we'll we'll understand something maybe
[32:06] one thing today that he might sanctify
[32:09] and cleanse it with the washing of Water
[32:12] by what the word now watch that he might
[32:16] present it to himself
[32:18] a glorious church not having spot
[32:23] or wrinkle
[32:25] or any such thing
[32:28] but that it should be holy
[32:30] and without let me see
[32:32] blemish
[32:35] now that's down here
[32:37] it's going to be real easy to do that
[32:39] there it's true somebody got to do it
[32:41] here before we go there that's right or
[32:43] like we were talking about Sunday
[32:46] you look what's on our shoulders
[32:48] we got to bring all that sixth Dimension
[32:51] here every person that died with the
[32:53] baptism my holy ghost from Paul's day or
[32:55] not from Paul but from the day of
[32:56] Pentecost
[32:58] not Azusa Street Pentecost 80 30
[33:01] Pentecost from 80 30 Pentecost to the
[33:04] day we take a change that sixth
[33:07] Dimension has got to empty into this
[33:08] Dimension that's right and somebody has
[33:10] got to have the power to bring them here
[33:12] that's right
[33:14] and we're still going to listen that's
[33:16] why I'm telling you we still going to be
[33:17] in flesh bodies
[33:20] reads Ephesians
[33:23] downstairs descend from heaven will
[33:25] shout course and Archangel truffle God
[33:27] the dead in Christ shall rise first so
[33:31] they're going to rise all in spirits no
[33:32] no glory of my body that's right and
[33:35] then we which are alive and remain shall
[33:40] be changed that's right
[33:45] break it brother
[33:47] right there is the whole thing we just
[33:50] got too many blemishes by the way oh
[33:52] lordy
[33:57] come on that's what the devil told you
[34:00] that's
[34:01] what
[34:02] she want men to love their wives because
[34:04] their own bodies he that loves his wife
[34:05] loves himself for no man ever yet hated
[34:08] his own flesh but nourishes it cherishes
[34:10] it even as a word amen
[34:13] board
[34:15] does the church
[34:17] for we are members of his body of his
[34:21] flesh
[34:22] and of his bone
[34:27] slash and Bone
[34:29] Flash and Bone he has no problem saying
[34:32] flesh and Bone all right because he's
[34:35] talking about true
[34:36] right here
[34:38] he's bringing it to a husband and wife
[34:40] and and feel your love but that's not
[34:43] feel your love right that's agape love
[34:47] amen
[34:49] right there this is a great mystery but
[34:52] I speak concerning Christ in the church
[34:55] he's gonna cross his in flesh now and
[34:57] he's going to have a flesh church amen
[34:59] amen so I may have to go by the grave or
[35:01] for purification somebody's going to
[35:04] stand here and say this
[35:05] body that I'm standing in has no hold on
[35:09] me
[35:10] none
[35:11] all right we're going to read some next
[35:13] Sunday where Jesus even talks about now
[35:15] he doesn't say all power Heaven on Earth
[35:17] is given unto me he doesn't say that
[35:19] until he gets to the
[35:20] after his glorification and after his
[35:23] a body changing after his resurrection
[35:26] but you'll see he says something here on
[35:28] Earth that's really profound and I got
[35:29] it there at the house when we will read
[35:32] it next Sunday Lord with him all right
[35:34] Hebrews 13 12 we always read Hebrews 13
[35:37] 8.
[35:38] let's read Hebrews 13 12. see what God
[35:41] says basketball 12 13.
[35:46] I love this app
[35:52] let's start verse 12. wherefore Jesus
[35:54] also that he might sanctify the people
[35:58] with his own blood suffered without the
[36:01] gate now remember
[36:02] he was taken out to Golgotha he wasn't
[36:05] he wasn't killed in the city of
[36:07] Jerusalem they took him out all right
[36:09] excuse me
[36:12] now what did he do he Sanctified the
[36:14] people
[36:15] with his own blood suffered without the
[36:17] gate let us go forth therefore unto him
[36:19] without the camp bearing his reproach
[36:23] for here we have no continuing City but
[36:27] we seek one to come
[36:32] by him therefore let us offer the
[36:34] sacrifice of praise to God continue that
[36:36] is the fruit of what our lips
[36:41] flesh
[36:43] giving thanks to his name but to do good
[36:46] and to communicate forget not for with
[36:49] such sacrifices God is well placed then
[36:51] you keep reading obeying them to have a
[36:53] rule over you but he's talking about
[36:56] Jesus Christ by his own blood Sanctified
[36:59] a group of people already
[37:04] remember it was it was done at Calvary
[37:06] but we just got to believe it right
[37:10] I mean listen what is our what is our
[37:12] greatest fear
[37:14] except that you're not born again what's
[37:16] our greatest fear that we'll do
[37:17] something in our flesh you will never do
[37:19] anything in your flesh that you don't
[37:21] want to do inside
[37:25] sure you'll be motivated but you the one
[37:28] that pulled the trigger
[37:31] he may put the gun in your hand or he
[37:33] may tell you everything's sweet and
[37:34] happy I'm talking about the devil
[37:36] everything's great but you got to say
[37:38] remember one brother around him says you
[37:39] sin as a Christian Satan can't come
[37:43] and make you sin you have to go out
[37:46] that's right that's what he's saying and
[37:49] that's profound because you have to go
[37:51] out
[37:52] to do the Senate what go out from here
[37:55] out that's right not go out where you
[37:58] gotta I'm in the room now I gotta go out
[38:00] no he means from here right out right
[38:03] from here through the filter of the
[38:06] spirit into the Flesh and then the flesh
[38:08] does what the spirit tells it to do the
[38:10] flesh can do nothing except what the
[38:12] spirit tells it today that's right yes
[38:15] sever somebody's spine
[38:18] that body
[38:19] ain't gonna ever do anything but you
[38:21] know what if he's not a Christian he's
[38:23] just as dirty right come on he's just if
[38:26] he's not a Christian if he's not born
[38:27] again and installed
[38:29] he's done for that's right right you
[38:31] still all the man never sinned in his
[38:33] life he never touched nobody he never
[38:34] done anything because he's paralyzed
[38:39] what am I telling you
[38:41] he's got all those things in his soul in
[38:43] his Spirit that's dealing with whether
[38:45] the body can work or not that's true is
[38:47] that all right that's right
[38:49] we got to live in this thing people but
[38:51] my greatest enemy is what goes on in my
[38:53] head not what goes on in my hands yes
[38:56] because I don't want that to come down
[38:59] manifest here yeah that's right amen
[39:02] because that same devil still comes but
[39:04] he has it's like it's like Jesus said he
[39:06] said the prince of this world come to
[39:08] ask nothing to me he comes
[39:10] he didn't say he won't leave he won't
[39:12] you know bother you he said he'll come
[39:13] that's right
[39:15] but I thought when the when the enemy
[39:17] comes in like a flood the spirit of
[39:18] God's supposed to want to raise up a
[39:19] standard yeah and that standard is
[39:21] inside of you not your well I didn't do
[39:23] that because I just didn't touch it oh
[39:25] come on
[39:26] mm-hmm
[39:27] what did the Pharisees what did Jesus
[39:29] tell Pharisees he said
[39:31] if you don't touch a girl
[39:33] you say you've not committed adultery
[39:35] with it he said but I say unto you
[39:37] whatever you think in your heart you've
[39:40] already went to bed with her in other
[39:42] words you've already done what you so
[39:44] what's the flesh got let's go
[39:46] listen brother Dale today he's got
[39:48] something powerful for him well he does
[39:51] everything
