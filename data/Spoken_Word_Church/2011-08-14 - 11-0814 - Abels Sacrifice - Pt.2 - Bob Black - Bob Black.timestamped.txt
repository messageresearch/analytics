[0:00] oh
[0:22] all right
[0:24] last time i talked about able sacrifice
[0:26] so we're going to finish up that taco
[0:29] let's go ahead and turn right agency
[0:31] forward
[0:54] and adam knew eve his wife and she can
[0:56] see and bear cane
[0:58] and said i have gotten a man from the
[1:00] lord
[1:01] she again bears his brother
[1:03] and abel was a keeper she became the
[1:05] tiller of the ground
[1:07] and in process of time it came to pass
[1:09] that came brother and through the ground
[1:12] and abel he also brought a person up his
[1:14] flock and of the fact thereof and the
[1:16] lord had respect and to able to his
[1:18] offer
[1:19] so that they came unto his offer he had
[1:21] not respect
[1:22] and cain was very raw and his
[1:24] countenance failed
[1:26] so last time we talked about
[1:29] why able sacrifice was received
[1:33] and how it was received
[1:35] and how it was a just a perfect type of
[1:38] our walk through justification
[1:39] sanctification of the baptism of my holy
[1:40] ghost
[1:42] and um today i'm just gonna i'm gonna
[1:44] kind of quickly go back through and then
[1:47] we're gonna look at um
[1:50] the the
[1:52] total offering the burnt offering
[1:55] a little bit closer
[1:56] so um
[1:59] let's start off by reviewing uh
[2:02] why
[2:03] abel's sacrifice was received because he
[2:06] got a revelation from god
[2:09] brother brown said in the lamb and the
[2:10] dove
[2:11] what is it then the rock is built upon
[2:13] as the divine revelation of who jesus
[2:15] christ is upon that solid rock christ
[2:17] builds his church
[2:19] and all the gates of hell will never
[2:21] prevail against it
[2:22] when that direct revelation comes from
[2:24] heaven that christ is your emancipator
[2:26] that when he has become your savior
[2:28] delivered and that is anchored in your
[2:30] heart all the devil's information will
[2:32] never make you deny it
[2:34] and that's the foundation for the whole
[2:36] walk is a revelation from god
[2:38] if you've got a revelation then you'll
[2:40] you won't
[2:42] it'll keep you all the way to the end
[2:44] and that's um
[2:46] if you look at romans 8 28 that's what
[2:48] he's talking about when it says that
[2:50] um
[2:51] i'll just read what brother brandon said
[2:53] about it all before you he did call off
[2:55] he called and justified on justified
[2:57] he's already glorified there's nothing
[2:59] out of order we think there is but look
[3:01] in the scriptures it's just getting
[3:02] exactly the way god's word said it was
[3:08] is it not
[3:13] testing
[3:28] a little bit louder
[3:58] justin
[4:03] um
[4:25] all right
[4:29] all right so um
[4:33] that's that's that's the king's highway
[4:35] right there is
[4:36] justification to sanctification and uh
[4:39] how
[4:40] we must have the blood applied now last
[4:42] time we talked about how able has to lay
[4:45] on the sacrifice because he's identified
[4:47] with christ he must lay on the bronze
[4:49] altar and it's the bronze because of
[4:50] judgment that's the same reason that the
[4:52] grass hurt suffering was when you looked
[4:54] at the brass circle
[4:56] y'all seeing already judged
[4:58] um
[4:59] so brother brown said
[5:02] you just have to have the same
[5:04] and then possession gave to the enemy
[5:06] after trial you just have to have the
[5:07] same the faith you've got like you have
[5:09] to start your car or come to church
[5:11] see a lot of people think they got to be
[5:12] something but no no that's wrong just
[5:14] common faith is all you have to apply
[5:17] the blood by
[5:19] hear the word and believe the word apply
[5:20] it that's all just pick up weeds
[5:22] anywhere there in palestine was history
[5:24] just a little weed growed out of the
[5:26] cracks in the walls and around
[5:27] dipped in their blood and put it on the
[5:29] wheel and the door closed
[5:32] people wonder how to get faith all you
[5:33] have to do is just listen to the word
[5:35] put in a
[5:37] from the church
[5:39] and faith will happen
[5:42] and that's uh
[5:44] when you look at the sacrifice
[5:46] there was three things that were
[5:48] burnt for the sacrifice with the burnt
[5:50] offering
[5:51] hyssop which represented common faith
[5:54] scarlet sanctification by blood
[5:57] and seizure which is the baptism of the
[5:59] holy ghost
[6:01] then so he's talking about this common
[6:03] history which is just that we find
[6:05] growing out anywhere just take it and
[6:07] that's what they use to apply the blood
[6:09] on the door first
[6:12] and then we get to sanctification and
[6:14] it's
[6:16] whenever you have a career of revelation
[6:18] from god and obedience always follows
[6:22] your revelation
[6:24] and you can see that with
[6:26] with april he when he believed god
[6:29] he did what
[6:31] he acted according to his revelation by
[6:33] taking the sacrifice and laid it on the
[6:35] altar
[6:37] and that's
[6:38] when you really get there out down to it
[6:41] that hebrews 9 13
[6:43] says that the blood of christ
[6:45] is supposed to purges our conscience
[6:48] from dead works to serve the living god
[6:50] and it sets our hearts for obedience and
[6:53] when you look in ezekiel 26 or 36
[6:57] he first he gives us a heart of flesh
[6:59] takes away our stoning heart is our
[7:00] flesh to receive it to receive his word
[7:03] and then he gives us a new spirit that
[7:04] sets us in line to be obedient to it and
[7:07] then
[7:09] he gives us his spirit
[7:12] now charles finney i love this this
[7:14] thing that he said about sanctification
[7:17] the doctrine of justification by faith
[7:19] produces sanctification by producing the
[7:21] only true obedience to the law
[7:24] by this i mean that when the mind
[7:25] understands his plan and exercises faith
[7:27] in it it naturally produces
[7:29] sanctification
[7:30] sanctification is holiness
[7:32] and holiness is nothing but obedience to
[7:34] the law consisting in love to god and
[7:36] love to man
[7:38] brother brown said in a token
[7:40] because if you say you believe
[7:43] and you don't follow the instructions of
[7:44] the word
[7:45] then you don't believe
[7:47] see
[7:49] so
[7:50] and he preached that the sermon works as
[7:52] fake express which goes into that
[7:57] when you believe then you're going to
[7:58] obey by your faith
[8:02] in adoption
[8:04] he says after you approve yourself
[8:06] sanctify yourself with your good
[8:07] behavior obedience to the holy holy
[8:09] spirit no matter what the world says
[8:13] i'm going to rub this really hard see
[8:14] because i don't mean it to be rude
[8:17] please don't don't really see don't
[8:18] really think that i'm i'm mean i don't
[8:20] want to be
[8:21] what worries me is to take people
[8:24] to them god sent truth and they'll turn
[8:26] right back around and just keep on doing
[8:28] the same thing and say they got the holy
[8:29] ghost
[8:31] that just nearly ruined you
[8:33] what's the matter they come right back
[8:34] to the same thing just like the children
[8:36] of israel
[8:37] they wanted a king so this king could
[8:38] rule over them and make them act like
[8:40] the amorites named malachites and
[8:42] philistines
[8:44] so now
[8:45] when you believed
[8:47] what did you do you did according to
[8:49] acts 238 which was
[8:52] go down to the water and be baptized
[8:55] and and acts
[8:57] let's let's look real quick at acts 2
[9:00] 41.
[9:10] acts chapter 21.
[9:28] this sums up
[9:31] what the people that heard peter's
[9:33] sermon
[9:34] what they did they gladly received his
[9:37] word
[9:38] and then they were baptized
[9:41] and the same day they were added unto
[9:42] them about three thousand souls
[9:44] they believed and then they did
[9:47] what according to their faith they were
[9:48] baptized and then
[9:51] they were added
[9:54] just like just like abel
[9:56] he believed
[9:58] did act according to his faith he
[10:00] brought his sacrifice and then his
[10:02] sacrifice was received
[10:04] by consuming fire
[10:06] and there's another little
[10:09] little thing that's very important and
[10:10] that is
[10:15] waiting on god
[10:18] because after you've
[10:22] after you believe and you've done all
[10:24] that god requires
[10:26] you can be confident that what you've
[10:28] done is right then just wait on the lord
[10:31] and the same
[10:32] the same form that applies for healing
[10:34] and baptism in the holy earth because
[10:36] healing is
[10:37] is the baptism of our body
[10:40] with the holy ghost
[10:41] and uh
[10:42] there's a quote in here i have it my
[10:44] brother says your body must be born
[10:46] again
[10:47] that's the rapture
[10:50] so
[10:51] luke 24 49 he said and behold i send the
[10:54] promise of my father upon me to tear you
[10:56] in the city of jerusalem
[10:58] until you be endued with power from on
[11:00] high
[11:02] and waiting is important because
[11:04] you couldn't wait
[11:06] and this spoken word is original you see
[11:08] that's what that's what's the matter
[11:09] with pentecost today they're
[11:11] manufacturing something they can't wait
[11:13] oh god they just can't wait so they
[11:15] committed those
[11:16] tears to manufacture something and what
[11:18] does it bring forth like it did the
[11:19] first time the first bride that couldn't
[11:21] wait
[11:22] she brought death to a bastard born
[11:23] child which we all our children know but
[11:25] god came in flesh to give us another
[11:27] birth to bring us back to original sons
[11:29] and daughters of god see
[11:30] there you are a life firm of eve never
[11:32] happened it never did why she mingled
[11:34] and kept it away instead of adam coming
[11:36] to earth for a bride when the time
[11:38] appointed would be just like christ
[11:40] would have come to the group christ
[11:42] would have come to his church
[11:44] he promised to do it
[11:46] god promised to multiply them but they
[11:48] had to wait until god's time
[11:50] in wisdom versus faith 1962 he said now
[11:53] you see the seas that she was holy and
[11:55] would have finally become a mother by
[11:57] the will of god through a spoken word
[11:59] she would have finally become a mother
[12:01] but she couldn't wait
[12:07] and he said
[12:09] and then there's here's something else
[12:11] if any person is coming in the prayer
[12:13] line let me sternly warn you if you're
[12:15] aiming to come to in the prayer line do
[12:17] not come until first you give your heart
[12:18] to christ then do not stop at that after
[12:22] you have repented and been baptized
[12:23] terry until you have received the
[12:25] baptism of the holy spirit
[12:27] and at trial 1964 abraham that's a good
[12:30] witness the word never said when he said
[12:32] he would he said i'll give you a child
[12:34] son by sarah
[12:36] not next month never said next month he
[12:39] said he would
[12:40] not win they prayer they shall lay hands
[12:43] on the sick they shall recover
[12:45] that's the idea the prayer of faith
[12:46] shall save the sick and god shall raise
[12:48] him up
[12:49] tear you in the city of jerusalem until
[12:51] you're in dude
[12:52] no not for one day two hours ten days
[12:55] ten years until the power comes
[12:58] and the reaction to action ministers
[13:00] your instructors go with it now that
[13:01] don't purpose in your heart that you're
[13:03] not going to come off your knees if it
[13:05] takes from now until saturday night how
[13:07] long shall i terry until you're new
[13:10] how long is until
[13:11] until you receive it
[13:14] i'll just skip over part of that
[13:16] paragraph drive at the devil defeat him
[13:18] he's a defeated person do you believe
[13:20] that he's just a big blood he has no
[13:22] legal rights we are three children
[13:24] born of the spirit of god we have a
[13:26] right to this god's heritage and we
[13:28] believe it
[13:31] and then
[13:33] if you uh
[13:34] if you were able to listen to the last
[13:36] we talked about we walk through the
[13:38] bible how able sacrifice will perceive
[13:40] by consuming fire and that's the same
[13:43] way that our sacrifice is received our
[13:45] sacrifices ourselves
[13:49] if you look at first corinthians 12 13
[13:51] i'll just read it
[13:53] for by one spirit we are all baptized
[13:56] into one body
[13:57] whether we be jews or gentiles whether
[13:59] we be bond or free and have been all
[14:01] made to drink as one spirit
[14:03] now hebrews 12 29 says for our god is a
[14:05] consuming fire
[14:07] and i'm gonna come back to that first
[14:09] corinthians 12 and a second for by one
[14:11] spirit we are all baptized
[14:14] then the future home of the heavenly
[14:15] bridegroom he said he justified the land
[14:17] sanctified him sent the holy ghost to
[14:19] fire and burnt the sin out of it and
[14:21] dwelt in him himself
[14:23] he does the earth that he's going to use
[14:25] in a plan of redemption the same way he
[14:27] repented and was baptized in water by
[14:29] noah jesus come and sanctified it by
[14:31] dripping his blood on it and claimed it
[14:33] and in the new earth has to come is to
[14:35] have a holy fire baptism you clean it of
[14:37] every devil
[14:38] every germ every sickness everything
[14:40] that there is and make it a new i saw a
[14:42] new heavenly new earth
[14:45] now
[14:47] one of one of the best stories in the
[14:48] bible i think to illustrate this is
[14:50] deuteronomy 9
[15:11] well all of the stores in the old
[15:12] testament kind of are are natural
[15:15] financial type of spiritual in the new
[15:17] testament so like in the old testament
[15:20] they would actually
[15:21] heal the works of the flesh which were
[15:23] the malachites
[15:25] and
[15:26] the anakins and in the new testament we
[15:28] get our on our knees and
[15:30] ask the lord to fight our battles
[15:35] so this
[15:37] now
[15:38] this is um
[15:41] been going into the new land
[15:43] and god is going to tell them how what's
[15:45] going to happen to the animals and and
[15:47] to keep it in context back in in uh
[15:50] numbers when they went into cash cornea
[15:52] they crossed over jordan because the
[15:54] spies went across the land and they saw
[15:57] some of the people over there were the
[15:58] anakins the anakins were these big
[16:00] giants and they said we can't we can't
[16:02] take it
[16:03] um
[16:04] so now let's let's see what happens
[16:06] after they
[16:07] cross third
[16:08] hero israel that our pastor for jordan
[16:11] this day
[16:12] to go in to possess nations greater and
[16:14] mightier than myself city's great and
[16:16] pitched up to heaven
[16:17] of people great and tall the children of
[16:19] the anakins whom thou
[16:21] and of whom thou has turned say who can
[16:23] stand before the children of the net
[16:26] understand therefore this day that the
[16:28] lord thy god as he was healed whatever
[16:30] before thee as a consuming fire he shall
[16:32] destroy them and he shall bring them
[16:34] down before thy face so shall thou drive
[16:36] them out and destroy them quickly as the
[16:38] lord said unto thee
[16:40] speak out loud thy heart after the lord
[16:42] thy god had cast them out from before
[16:44] thee saying for my righteousness the
[16:46] lord brought me and possessed this land
[16:48] but for the wickedness of these nations
[16:50] though the workers drive them out from
[16:51] before thee
[16:53] not for thy righteousness but for the
[16:55] uprightness of thine heart this is our
[16:56] good represents their land but for the
[16:58] weakness of these nations the lord thy
[16:59] god is driving out from before
[17:01] and that he may perform the word which
[17:03] the lord's swear to thy father is
[17:04] abraham isaac and jacob
[17:07] so that's
[17:08] when you think about what's the what's
[17:10] the difference between sanctification
[17:11] and baptism that only goes for because
[17:13] they're both a cleansing
[17:15] work sanctification cleanses you to put
[17:17] you in line to serve the lord
[17:19] but the holy ghost
[17:20] purges you of withdrawals and sin
[17:24] and just like just like how the consumed
[17:26] fire went before
[17:28] the children of israel and drove out the
[17:29] animals from the land and
[17:32] just looking forward
[17:34] one day one of the children of the
[17:35] anakin named goliath
[17:37] stood before nathan and david had the
[17:39] same faith that these for these children
[17:42] did
[17:44] and know what happened there
[17:49] in israel in the church when the
[17:51] believer in 1953
[17:53] when the believer firmly believes in the
[17:55] lord jesus christ
[17:57] god is under obligation to give him the
[17:59] holy ghost confirmation of his faith
[18:02] say what's the matter brother random
[18:03] just your faith that's all if you surely
[18:05] believe god's there to give it to you
[18:07] while peter spake these words the holy
[18:09] ghost fell on them that heard the word
[18:11] is that right acts 10 49 all right
[18:14] notice the holy ghost and fire came from
[18:15] heaven burn out all the cross circumcise
[18:18] the heart cut off all the surplus and
[18:19] become a new creature and draw us as
[18:22] anything that's not supposed to be there
[18:24] when you look at deuteronomy 9 the
[18:25] anarchists weren't supposed to be there
[18:27] drawls is when you when you melt a
[18:30] chemical like a metal like 10 or
[18:32] something then the dirt comes up at the
[18:34] top and that's drops and they take it
[18:36] out
[18:36] so the
[18:37] sooner fire will get rid of everything
[18:41] all the
[18:42] inpatients
[18:43] the uh temper tantrums
[18:45] um
[18:47] and it leaves behind patients and all
[18:49] these technologies
[18:54] and influence 1963
[18:56] did you notice god cleanses his prophets
[18:58] by fire not by theology or a book of
[19:00] some kind
[19:02] see he cleans his people by fire holy
[19:04] ghost and fire not by declaration of
[19:05] creeds or books or something you've got
[19:07] to learn a bunch of prayers and so forth
[19:09] he cleans him by fire off of the office
[19:11] that's how he sets him in order
[19:13] yeah yes sir that's it that's how he
[19:15] cleans his prop cleans his prophets at
[19:16] the beginning with 120 was in an upper
[19:18] room the holy ghost fell and tongues of
[19:20] fire set upon it they were cleansed and
[19:22] ready for service
[19:24] not by learning get a bachelor of art or
[19:26] dd phd you're getting holy fire from
[19:28] heaven that takes the lying off of your
[19:30] lips and takes the carnality out of you
[19:32] burns that stuff away that draws to the
[19:34] world and puts his presence in there and
[19:36] lives through that person
[19:38] so
[19:39] we've got just a few more minutes let's
[19:41] get into the whole burnt offering the
[19:43] whole offering
[19:48] was
[19:51] when it would go on the offer it because
[19:53] it's called the open offering was
[19:55] completely consumed
[19:57] and when you
[19:58] normally they would come and offer this
[20:00] uh
[20:01] one sacrifice but if if the overall
[20:04] offering was combined with another
[20:05] sacrifice
[20:06] the order was
[20:07] the sin offering would be off the first
[20:10] then the burnt offering and then the
[20:11] peace offering and isn't that just
[20:13] perfect that you believe in the sin
[20:15] offering is offered in the burn offering
[20:17] and then you're at peace with god
[20:20] um
[20:21] so let's take a look a little leviticus
[20:23] chapter one we're not going to read that
[20:25] because it goes into the what the whole
[20:27] current offering is but um
[20:29] leviticus chapter six verse nine
[20:32] let's take a look at that
[20:52] command aaron and his son say this is
[20:54] the law of the burnt offering it is the
[20:57] burnt offering because of the burning
[20:58] upon the altar all night into the
[21:00] morning and the fire they always shall
[21:02] shall be burning in it
[21:04] so in other words it's going to be
[21:06] totally consumed my brother brandon said
[21:07] in some quotes how they like where last
[21:09] time at the offering the burnt offering
[21:11] was not completely consumed and it was
[21:13] not received so they have to leave it
[21:16] leave it on the altar they cannot take
[21:17] off any unburnt piece
[21:19] if um from what they will do
[21:21] if you look at
[21:24] some of the
[21:25] how
[21:26] the history of the
[21:28] offerings they would
[21:30] the next morning if there was anything
[21:31] left especially during the
[21:34] well during the the big sacrifices they
[21:37] were bringing 100 000 offerings a week
[21:39] or whatever then they would pile all the
[21:42] unburnt
[21:42] into a big a big heap on the in the
[21:45] center of the offer the altar was huge
[21:47] probably bigger than this room just to
[21:50] give you an idea so they would pile it
[21:52] all into a huge heat and that was called
[21:54] the apple
[21:55] and because they couldn't take it off
[21:57] until it was completely consumed
[22:00] leviticus chapter 6
[22:06] verse 12 13.
[22:13] paul's already hit chapter six
[22:26] now i remember we talked last time about
[22:28] how
[22:28] uh after
[22:30] moses offered
[22:31] his sacrifice after he god told him how
[22:34] to set everything up he got everything
[22:36] arranged and god
[22:37] consumed the first sacrifice the same
[22:40] thing with solomon
[22:42] uh and on down food all that all the
[22:44] bible so
[22:47] so the question might come up
[22:50] what if you offered an offering after
[22:51] that
[22:52] did god consume your your offering in
[22:54] the same way so let's see
[22:57] he shall uh verse 12 13
[23:01] and the fire upon the altar shall be
[23:03] burning in it it shall not be put out
[23:05] and the priest shall bring wood on it
[23:07] every morning and lay the burnt offering
[23:08] and order upon it and he shall burn
[23:10] there on the battle of the peace office
[23:12] the fire shall ever be burning upon the
[23:14] offer it shall never go out
[23:19] so
[23:23] what i'm getting at is the same fire
[23:24] that fell at pentecost it's the same
[23:26] fires burning in me today
[23:29] and you know brother brown said he was
[23:30] talking about the greater works that
[23:32] when jesus was on earth he said
[23:34] he couldn't really talk about the holy
[23:36] ghost because he's not a sympathetic
[23:38] father yet but now
[23:40] we can say
[23:41] i've got it and you can have it
[23:43] and uh
[23:44] it's the same fire that the same same
[23:47] consuming fire story goes all the way
[23:49] from the bottom
[23:51] and then just real quick we're running
[23:54] out of time
[23:56] in leviticus 10
[23:58] native and by who
[24:00] took streams fire and put it on the
[24:01] offer
[24:05] and brother brandon said in revelation
[24:06] chapter four
[24:08] oh for man tried to go in the holiest of
[24:10] holies someday somebody some bible
[24:12] teacher tell me that somebody started
[24:13] into this holiest of holies without
[24:15] coming through here to die
[24:17] sons took strange fire one day some
[24:19] denominational fire when it wasn't the
[24:21] nomination of fire and they died at the
[24:23] door is that right or eli's sons it was
[24:25] i believe sometimes took the man on
[24:27] representing his undergraduate
[24:30] and they went out fire from the lord and
[24:32] devoured them and they died before the
[24:33] lord
[24:34] must be god's consuming fire that purges
[24:37] us
[24:38] from the hand we're out of time
[24:49] thank you lord i'm fired now
