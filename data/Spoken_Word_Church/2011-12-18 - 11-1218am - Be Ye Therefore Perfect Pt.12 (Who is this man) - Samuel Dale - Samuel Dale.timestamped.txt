[12:41] matthew 5 psalms 32 and remember
[12:44] we're eating together today after the
[12:46] service and then we will not be having
[12:48] an afternoon service

[13:40] okay
[13:41] now uh we're gonna because of our
[13:44] conflict of doing and a lot of people
[13:46] are out this weekend and everything
[13:48] and it generally works that way around
[13:51] christmas time so
[13:53] we've come up with an idea that next
[13:55] year starting next year now we're going
[13:58] to have our thanksgiving
[14:00] and our christmas time together as one
[14:03] time
[14:04] all right it will be the first sunday in

[14:17] we will schedule it to be from then on
[14:19] and put our thanksgiving together with
[14:22] our
[14:23] christmas because it's always a conflict
[14:25] of everybody backwards and forth and a
[14:28] bunch missing today so just you know
[14:30] just remember that and be much in prayer
[14:33] that the lord would bless all of us
[14:35] anything no other announcements
[14:37] for the watch night service

[15:16] that would stand today and sing from
[15:17] their heart and tell us that
[15:19] they want to go tell it on the mountain
[15:21] and lord just tell it everywhere so
[15:24] let's just be that way father and you
[15:26] that we could go and testify and witness
[15:29] all around and just let your light shine
[15:32] in our hearts and let
[15:33] jesus christ be the one who would be
[15:35] living in us forgive our sins
[15:38] lead us by that understanding hand that
[15:40] we may walk in you and lord teach us to
[15:43] wait upon you bless those that are not

[15:48] then by way of internet then we pray
[15:50] that you bless them also we love you
[15:52] guide us now and keep us in jesus name
[15:55] amen
[15:56] now brother richard
[15:58] wilson i forgot to announce it but
[16:01] his sister pat she fell the other day
[16:04] and broke her foot
[16:06] and everything so they had to operate on
[16:08] that so remember that and brother hobart
[16:11] arnold
[16:12] the brother there he's about 81 2 3 or
[16:15] something like that years old but he has
[16:17] now went
[16:18] uh because i reckon of the diabetic
[16:21] condition he's blind in both eyes so it
[16:24] was just one now it's moved into the
[16:27] other one so just remember that and keep
[16:30] praying for him
[16:31] he's kind of a guy that likes to get out
[16:33] and go
[16:34] so it's going to be really a hindrance
[16:35] to him you know so pray that the lord
[16:37] would help him and bless him all right
[16:40] so
[16:42] matthew 25 matthew 5 37 we've been
[16:44] reading
[16:46] so let's just read this and go on into
[16:48] the message today
[16:51] and just hold your hats on because
[16:54] i may surprise you in a little bit what
[16:56] i have to say
[16:57] okay
[16:59] uh matthew 5 37 but let your
[17:01] communications be yeah
[17:04] so ever is more than these cometh of
[17:07] evil
[17:08] you have heard it hath been said an eye
[17:09] for an eye and a two for a two but i say
[17:12] unto you that ye
[17:13] that you resist not evil
[17:16] but whosoever shall smite thee on thy
[17:19] right cheek turn to him the other also
[17:21] and if any man shall sue thee at the law
[17:24] take away and take away thy cop let him
[17:26] have thy cloak also and whosoever shall
[17:29] compel thee to go a mile go with him
[17:31] twain
[17:32] give to him that asketh thee and from
[17:34] him that would borrow thee turn not thou
[17:37] away
[17:38] you have heard that it hath been said
[17:40] thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate
[17:42] thine enemy but i say unto you love your
[17:45] enemies bless them that curse you and do
[17:47] good to them that hate you and pray for
[17:49] them which despitefully use you and
[17:51] persecute you
[17:53] that you may be the children so you'll
[17:55] manifest that you may be the children of
[17:57] your father which is in heaven now that
[17:59] same father is one down here he's
[18:01] supposed to be just as perfect right
[18:02] right okay
[18:06] for he maketh your son to rise on the
[18:07] evil and on the good and send his reign
[18:10] on the just and the unjust for if you
[18:12] love them which love you what reward
[18:14] have ye do not even the publicans the
[18:17] same
[18:18] and if you salute your brethren only
[18:20] what do you more than others do not even
[18:24] the public and so be therefore perfect
[18:26] even as your father which is in heaven
[18:28] is
[18:29] perfect now let's go
[18:31] to
[18:32] psalms
[18:34] 32
[18:37] verse 1 and 2. blessed is he whose
[18:39] transgressions is
[18:41] forgiven
[18:42] whose sin is covered
[18:45] blessed is the man unto whom the lord
[18:47] imputed not iniquity
[18:49] and who knew spirit there is
[18:51] no
[18:52] god he may be seated the lord that is
[18:55] blessing to the
[18:56] reading of the word
[18:58] now i ask you a question
[19:03] there
[19:04] last weekend or sometime there
[19:08] of who is this man
[19:12] that we would think about that his sins
[19:14] would not be imputed
[19:17] intuitive
[19:19] and uh i've got some good answers
[19:22] good thoughts you know and they're all
[19:25] they've all been correct
[19:28] and it's relating to the situation that
[19:30] we're talking about
[19:33] but i still want to ask you a question
[19:35] before we enter into the doings because
[19:38] we're going to read they're going to
[19:39] pull up psalms go ahead and pull it up
[19:42] brother anderson um romans 4 7 and 8 and
[19:46] then we'll go to
[19:48] um
[19:49] psalms 32 1 and 2
[19:51] we want them together so just pull up
[19:54] uh
[19:56] pull it on that brother until you just
[19:58] leave six and seven and eight and then
[19:59] put
[20:00] the other underneath all right
[20:03] now
[20:05] i want to ask you a simple question
[20:10] where is there a man anywhere that
[20:15] this would qualify
[20:18] to be able to say these things
[20:21] now we've had people who've tried to
[20:24] express
[20:25] uh
[20:26] their views
[20:28] and their thoughts
[20:31] about these things
[20:33] and as i said some of you gave me
[20:35] uh statements and they were good
[20:39] and it's relating to the the point
[20:43] but
[20:45] i want you to be real careful with me
[20:47] today to pay close attention
[20:50] because
[20:55] the psalmist david
[21:00] taken from romans you know bring it up
[21:03] put these two this is the psalmist david
[21:05] this is the romans paul
[21:07] all right
[21:08] now the psalmist david
[21:12] says you know
[21:13] basically
[21:15] it's a little different that's where you
[21:16] want to read it together
[21:19] now basically they say the same thing
[21:25] blessed is the man to whom god will not
[21:27] impute sin
[21:30] now
[21:32] it's odd that these two men would make
[21:34] this statement
[21:39] then
[21:40] thinking of the psalmist david
[21:46] was he a special filler
[21:50] was he a seed as we call it in the
[21:53] message you know
[21:54] how they want to prove noah was a seed
[21:56] this was a seed that was a seed
[21:58] everybody wants to run seeds
[22:00] into all of these things
[22:01] and i thank god i didn't get a one
[22:04] some of you may think that and didn't
[22:06] write it down but i didn't get a
[22:08] statement
[22:09] that it was because it was born with a
[22:10] seed in them so at least you're
[22:12] listening amen because you know i don't
[22:15] believe that amen all right that's right
[22:17] i believe that everybody is born
[22:20] with an opportunity
[22:22] that's right brother brown talks about
[22:24] the great faith
[22:25] he said everybody's born with that
[22:28] faith
[22:30] all right say well there was a seed in
[22:32] me yeah i agree with it
[22:39] but a seed without life what is it
[22:45] a seed cannot reproduce itself
[22:48] it must be put through processes
[22:51] no matter where it would be the natural
[22:52] seed of an individual or a corn seed you
[22:54] know whatever
[22:56] it has to be brought through processes
[22:59] all right
[23:01] but now who is david and paul talking
[23:03] about
[23:06] when you would look at david and you'd
[23:08] say well
[23:09] david
[23:13] has there ever been any sin imputed to
[23:15] you
[23:19] you said blessed is a man to whom sin
[23:21] would not be imputed
[23:28] david
[23:30] is it not so that
[23:33] you were not able to go and build a
[23:35] house for god
[23:42] because you shed too much blood
[23:45] and with that blood would be what's the
[23:47] name of your eye
[23:49] you know besheba's husband
[23:53] so david all of his life was paying for
[23:57] the things that he done
[24:01] and was forbidden now to build god a
[24:03] house
[24:04] that's right
[24:07] so david
[24:08] who are you talking about
[24:15] oh
[24:17] that's right
[24:21] paul you say it in romans
[24:25] unless it is a man to whom the lord will
[24:27] not impute sin
[24:33] but paul i remember you writing to the
[24:36] corinthians
[24:38] a note
[24:41] ii corinthians 5 and 10.
[24:47] to worry that
[24:50] you was reminding people that
[24:52] that's right be careful
[24:55] that there was a judgment seat
[24:59] that we all must stand before
[25:02] right
[25:07] so paul are you in one side of your
[25:09] mouth saying
[25:11] sin is not imputed
[25:15] and on the other side of your mouth
[25:16] you're telling us to be careful because
[25:19] records can be killed
[25:25] who is this man
[25:32] to whom sin is not imputed
[25:38] now we get into the next message the
[25:39] lord
[25:40] willing i think brother forney's
[25:43] supposed to come this coming wednesday
[25:45] for the 40's possibly going to be here
[25:47] wednesday
[25:48] so we're just leaving that way possibly
[25:50] he's in africa right now
[25:53] but
[25:54] the next message we'll pick up
[25:56] in john
[25:58] you know
[26:00] how the seed reminded the enemy cannot
[26:02] stand
[26:04] we'll get into that and we'll cover
[26:06] those things but i'm just asking you a
[26:08] simple question
[26:10] very slow very
[26:14] wanting you to think
[26:20] is these men
[26:23] saying one thing and living another
[26:30] is it all right for us
[26:34] as
[26:35] supposingly being believers christians
[26:38] born again
[26:41] is it all right for us to just go out
[26:43] and live like the devil because it's not
[26:44] imputed
[26:48] what do you think
[26:57] very solid very serious what do you
[26:59] think that's right
[27:04] is it that we should go out as i was
[27:06] quoting the other day paul's saying that
[27:08] you know
[27:10] let us sin that grace may abound you
[27:12] know
[27:15] in other words somebody believed paul
[27:17] was saying that
[27:19] so we made an outland an outlandish
[27:22] statement about it you said god forbid
[27:24] because if we serve that sin we are of
[27:27] that sin
[27:28] amen
[27:31] so now as he's saying it's okay well i'm
[27:34] so goody-goody
[27:37] you know
[27:39] all right we would surely get away from
[27:41] that
[27:42] to not think about how goody-goody we
[27:45] are
[27:47] you know some special
[27:49] thing you know
[27:52] my people came over on the mayflower
[27:54] yeah
[27:56] yeah probably a bunch of crooks they run
[27:58] out of the country over there because
[28:00] they certainly didn't send the best over
[28:01] here to start with
[28:03] that's right
[28:04] like castro sent us opened up his
[28:06] prisons and sent us all of his
[28:10] goody goody people didn't he yeah
[28:14] right
[28:16] but now
[28:17] i told you the other night that's the
[28:18] hardest thing to try to preach
[28:21] is a straight line on grace
[28:24] and works and life
[28:26] and doings
[28:30] because of our previous teachings our
[28:33] understandings and our thoughts of human
[28:36] mortals
[28:38] we think that maybe there was some
[28:39] reason god saved us
[28:44] something i'd done or didn't do
[28:49] somebody have to be born in the right
[28:51] family
[28:56] yes
[28:58] that's my point
[29:01] who is that man that paul's talking
[29:03] about who is that man that david is
[29:05] talking about right
[29:10] that god won't impute sin
[29:15] is it okay to just live like the devil
[29:17] it doesn't matter what i do i'm born
[29:19] again that's a good baptist once they
[29:21] always say doctrine
[29:28] then a good method this is you know
[29:30] don't teach it no more the baptists
[29:31] don't either but
[29:33] a good method is this and just make sure
[29:35] you're right when you go down
[29:39] because you can be sanctified and lose
[29:41] it and sanctify and lose it just make
[29:43] sure you're on the upward plane when you
[29:47] pass on
[29:50] and i'm not making a lot of those people
[29:52] that's that's right that's right
[29:57] if i make light of anything it's of you
[29:59] and i
[30:02] because we can hold those doctrines
[30:07] and refuse to look straight at it and
[30:09] see what we've got
[30:11] that's right
[30:12] and justify our condemn
[30:14] of course we do a lot of justifying
[30:16] ourselves
[30:18] right
[30:19] and condemning
[30:21] everybody else right
[30:24] and very little condemning ourselves
[30:29] it's generally we're looking down at
[30:31] somebody else and what they do or don't
[30:33] do
[30:38] but i'm just asking you a simple
[30:40] question
[30:43] why would those men say that
[30:49] all right
[30:51] now i want you to look at it very
[30:52] seriously but now i want you to remember
[30:56] you out on the internet remember it
[31:00] then we're going to read what brother
[31:01] brown says in a
[31:02] minute david did not say blessed is the
[31:06] man to whom god will not impute sin
[31:09] those are not verbatim words of david
[31:13] those are verbatim verbatim words of
[31:16] paul right amen
[31:20] now david said that in the basis of
[31:22] brother branham when the statements will
[31:23] come he said see david in the scripture
[31:26] says blessed is the man
[31:28] to whom god will not impute sin
[31:32] so
[31:36] evidently
[31:40] paul is summing up
[31:43] the statement
[31:44] that david was trying to make
[31:49] and remember the situation that david
[31:51] was under the law
[31:54] not a born-again believer
[31:59] you agree
[32:01] because jesus had not been glorified the
[32:03] scripture said so the holy ghost could
[32:06] not been given the scripture says
[32:10] all right
[32:13] so david is evidently speaking something
[32:17] by the spirit of god
[32:20] because that's what we believe he was
[32:21] doing right right you know my prophecy
[32:24] men of old
[32:26] they
[32:27] brought us the word
[32:30] but looking at it from his situation
[32:34] he could not see the totality or
[32:36] conclusion of the matter
[32:39] that paul could see
[32:41] right amen
[32:44] so he would word it a little different
[32:46] because he would not have the
[32:48] understanding to word it
[32:52] but now listen then when the prophet
[32:54] would quote david as saying these things
[32:58] remember the prophet is putting together
[33:00] what david is saying with the conclusion
[33:03] of what paul contended to say
[33:05] of what david was trying to or finished
[33:07] saying what david was trying to say
[33:09] that's right everybody with me amen
[33:13] so now look at it
[33:16] see the psalmist david says
[33:19] blessed is he whose transgression is
[33:21] forgiven whose sin is covered
[33:24] all right
[33:25] blessed is a man to whom the lord
[33:27] imputed not iniquity in whose spirit
[33:30] there is no god
[33:34] but when paul brought it forth in his
[33:37] statement in
[33:38] romans
[33:39] 4
[33:41] he says even as david described the
[33:43] blessings of the man unto whom god
[33:45] imputed righteousness
[33:49] maybe he didn't mention righteousness
[33:54] of the man
[33:56] unto whom god imputed righteousness
[33:59] without works david didn't mention those
[34:01] things
[34:02] right
[34:03] but one of them is looking at it one way
[34:05] the other one is looking right and
[34:07] concluding what this are telling us
[34:10] what the spirit was trying to say
[34:12] through david right amen
[34:15] are you listening
[34:17] david was trying to say these things
[34:22] but he didn't have the words right the
[34:24] thoughts the holy ghost to direct him
[34:28] only as a leader by speaking by the
[34:30] spirit
[34:32] all right
[34:33] look
[34:36] so paul says i heard he's concluding
[34:38] that faith without you know imputed
[34:40] righteousness without works sin blessed
[34:42] is that they whose iniquities are
[34:43] forgiven
[34:45] and whose sins are covered
[34:48] all right
[34:49] now
[34:50] david says your sins are covered
[34:55] your iniquities are forgiven
[34:59] so they're holding their point right
[35:02] because david was looking at it as only
[35:05] the fact that his sins could be covered
[35:11] paul is looking at it that his sins was
[35:14] eradicated
[35:16] that's right
[35:17] away with it
[35:20] but david couldn't see that
[35:24] but he knew as i was trying to express
[35:26] to start with
[35:29] then he wasn't allowed to build a temple
[35:30] for that and he got into trouble and
[35:32] lost a baby and
[35:34] all kind of things on because of his
[35:36] life that's right
[35:38] that he lived
[35:41] and paul summed it up by saying
[35:46] we're not supposed to sin that grace may
[35:47] abound
[35:49] right we're going to give an account
[35:54] of these deeds and things we do in our
[35:56] bodies
[35:59] if we don't confess them here right
[36:02] right
[36:03] now we get rid of them here they won't
[36:05] be anything
[36:06] right
[36:09] see god can't remember i love that what
[36:11] brother adam said you know i can't see
[36:14] what somebody else has asked god and god
[36:16] has forgiven them i can't pull it out
[36:19] and tell them about it
[36:20] i like that heaven yes sir
[36:25] so
[36:28] david is here
[36:32] speaking of a covering
[36:34] of god not imputed iniquity
[36:37] in whose spirit there's no child he's
[36:39] speaking of a great man
[36:42] heaven
[36:43] he doesn't say
[36:46] blessed is a man to whom the lord will
[36:48] not impute sin
[36:49] in verbatim words
[36:52] right
[36:55] but when david picks it up by the same
[36:57] holy spirit that told this man to say
[37:00] this
[37:01] the same holy spirit brings it through
[37:03] this man
[37:04] and he concludes it
[37:08] in verse 8 by saying blessed is the man
[37:10] to whom the lord will not impute sin
[37:12] amen
[37:15] now
[37:17] so in order to give you some idea of
[37:20] what i'm talking about
[37:22] that
[37:26] and i'm being real slow because i want
[37:28] to be
[37:30] but i want you to think about what i'm
[37:32] saying
[37:33] all right
[37:39] so then one man is looking at
[37:42] a future point of salvation
[37:47] and doesn't see the total clarity
[37:50] of his
[37:51] existence
[37:54] so he doesn't speak
[37:57] and say that blessed is the man to whom
[37:59] god will not infuse in david doesn't say
[38:02] that
[38:03] right
[38:08] but when paul concludes his of what
[38:11] david is trying to say by the spirit
[38:14] then he brings it down into new
[38:16] testament words
[38:18] and shows us what david was trying to
[38:20] say by the spirit right
[38:23] david was prophesying of a man right
[38:30] and david said this look
[38:32] and david said this down here blessed is
[38:34] the man to whom the lord will not impute
[38:36] sin he would have had to have the new
[38:38] birth yep that's right
[38:41] that's right
[38:42] so by not having a new birth and even
[38:45] though the holy spirit can direct a man
[38:47] to to say things
[38:50] he will not direct him over the
[38:53] uh beings of where he's at
[38:58] the psalmist david great thing sit out
[39:00] there i have a man killed in one day and
[39:02] the next day sit out there and say they
[39:04] pierce my hands and my feet right
[39:06] just seeing
[39:08] the joys of the lord right in writing
[39:10] the bible
[39:15] are you following me yes right so when
[39:18] brother random concludes his
[39:20] he concludes by tying together paul and
[39:23] this says david said
[39:28] is the man to whom god will not impute
[39:29] sin
[39:32] because he knows what both of them was
[39:34] talking about in the spirit amen
[39:37] when i was in the spirit was seeing
[39:39] the possibility in his day that his sins
[39:42] could be covered by the atonement
[39:45] that his iniquity
[39:48] could be forgiven by his
[39:50] honest confession of his heart
[39:54] you agree amen
[39:57] but paul looks back at it
[39:59] from the new birth
[40:04] and he concludes it by saying see
[40:06] blessed is the man whom god will not
[40:08] impute sin so there must be somebody
[40:14] now we're going to tie this together
[40:16] with a purist message
[40:19] we've been reading matthew you know
[40:22] be there for perfect even as your father
[40:23] in heaven is perfect
[40:28] and i hope we came to the conclusion to
[40:31] see
[40:32] that it could not be saying uh what we
[40:34] used to think it said
[40:39] and he's come to the conclusion of
[40:41] seeing that the only person that can be
[40:43] as perfect as god is is god himself
[40:50] unless our righteousness then the same
[40:52] man said exceeds the righteousness
[40:56] which means they were not guilty as i
[40:58] said about paul
[41:00] concerning the law of blameless he said
[41:04] but he couldn't find the righteousness
[41:06] god was looking for
[41:08] because it's impossible to do that
[41:10] without having a new birth
[41:12] amen
[41:15] so unless you're
[41:16] exceeding the rights and describes the
[41:18] first season with no wise enter
[41:20] so we found out that a man that the only
[41:22] way he could do that was to be born
[41:25] again amen
[41:29] right
[41:31] and then that born-again experience
[41:35] is what makes us just as perfect as god
[41:37] is right
[41:39] right right
[41:42] it's not mine own righteousness paul
[41:44] said
[41:45] that's filthy right smile called it
[41:47] right
[41:49] but
[41:51] the righteousness which is by faith
[41:54] right
[41:54] or what was imputed
[41:58] unto us
[42:00] because of our believing amen
[42:04] right amen
[42:05] now because of our believing our faith
[42:08] god could impute righteousness unto us
[42:13] and not just cover our sins
[42:19] that won't work right
[42:22] you got to be eradicated
[42:24] right that's right not just divorce put
[42:26] away sit over side some that can come
[42:29] back up later no that's right
[42:32] that'll be eradicated
[42:35] all right
[42:38] so then
[42:41] if we have the new birth
[42:48] i don't let my notes don't forget it
[42:53] if we have the new birth
[42:58] the new birth is the life of god
[43:01] right amen
[43:03] not i that live us but what
[43:05] christ that liveth in me and the life
[43:07] that i now live
[43:09] in the flesh
[43:11] i live with the faith of god
[43:14] all right
[43:16] now somebody remind me after a while
[43:19] if i get through
[43:21] you just say stop
[43:23] now finish that about that
[43:25] new birth tied together with our lives
[43:29] and about the flesh so keep up with that
[43:31] way
[43:32] after a while you say hold it you didn't
[43:34] finish it
[43:36] because if i lose the thought then i'd
[43:38] have to preach for an hour to get it
[43:39] back so let him hang on
[43:42] but now listen
[43:45] by the new birth
[43:48] which is to receive the life of jesus
[43:50] christ
[43:53] those were related to basically the
[43:55] thoughts that was given to me you know
[43:58] in the form of relating to the new birth
[44:00] and receiving christ and letting christ
[44:02] live in us and coming from uh genesis 1
[44:06] 26
[44:07] man which is eternal life
[44:10] all right the soul of god divided
[44:12] amongst the born-again believers
[44:14] makes all of us
[44:16] god made manifest in human flesh
[44:19] by the new birth
[44:22] problem with that
[44:23] makes us his children
[44:26] and that's what we've been reading in
[44:27] matthew
[44:29] but you'd be his children
[44:33] and then we would manifest these things
[44:35] outwardly about the
[44:38] so you get the court you know give him
[44:40] this do this do that
[44:43] then you would wind up and
[44:45] have the life of god
[44:48] all right
[44:51] so now
[44:54] the new birth
[44:56] means more than the prophecy than
[44:58] anything else in the world
[44:59] that's right because only by the new
[45:01] birth
[45:02] can we have eternal life all right
[45:05] justification is wade who's been
[45:07] preaching to us that's done one
[45:09] wonderful job talking about the the
[45:12] justification saying pitch the baptism
[45:14] and hold us from abraham
[45:15] and no
[45:17] but see justification is a work of the
[45:19] holy spirit
[45:22] now remember that thought here while
[45:24] don't let me lose it
[45:28] sanctification is a work of the holy
[45:30] spirit that's right
[45:34] justification chops off your past sins
[45:37] there's nothing to your nature
[45:38] whatsoever just chops off that sin
[45:43] brings you a new nature yeah
[45:45] why because it's chopped off
[45:48] if it's chopped off then
[45:50] it's supposed to have that been gone
[45:52] that's right that's why people used to
[45:54] tell me so boy when i got born again i
[45:56] quit this out in the other i said well i
[45:58] quit that before right i was even
[46:00] considered i guess to be justified
[46:03] you know right
[46:06] sanctification is a work of the holy
[46:08] spirit
[46:09] that's right
[46:10] i'm cleansing and setting aside for
[46:12] service
[46:15] but the baptism
[46:18] is the holy spirit amen right that's
[46:20] right which is the life of god
[46:23] now i wanted to have weight wednesday
[46:24] night so much but i better let him
[46:26] preach his whole message
[46:28] we kept on reading all of that by and
[46:30] referred to by faith by faith
[46:34] you get time one of these days i want
[46:36] you to go in there and see how many by
[46:37] faith they are in hebrews 11.
[46:42] there's only one true faith
[46:52] all the rest of those by
[46:57] know why
[47:00] why does he keep saying about faith by
[47:01] faith by faith by saying and then one
[47:03] time it says true faith
[47:10] because every one of them
[47:12] was by faith it was things they lived
[47:14] and done
[47:16] no by faith nor done this by faith
[47:18] abraham done this by faith this was done
[47:20] by faith but then all at once right in
[47:22] the middle of it it says through faith
[47:25] say
[47:29] yep
[47:31] say amen
[47:33] one true of a whole crowd
[47:39] oh sarah is the top of the bride
[47:42] amen
[47:43] amen see we're going through a journey
[47:46] all of them byes had already been done
[47:51] so paul wasn't going to leave it
[47:54] but it'd only be by what all them done
[47:56] he wanted to bring it down to the day
[47:58] we're living amen
[47:59] so he said sarah through faith
[48:04] i want to say receive seed remember
[48:08] through faith
[48:09] amen
[48:10] you know that was the journey wade was
[48:12] talking about that you go through a
[48:14] journey through justification
[48:16] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[48:18] ghost and then you just really start
[48:20] your journey you know that's right
[48:22] because that's when you get born again
[48:24] and you're still going through
[48:26] amen
[48:31] so sarah
[48:33] paul concludes
[48:36] now here's our thoughts let's see if i
[48:38] can get it
[48:39] i thought say that abraham
[48:42] had enough for him and sarah
[48:45] so he just got his change and then he
[48:47] changed her
[48:54] see we led all to abraham right
[49:03] let's read that what is it hebrews 11.
[49:06] i'll make sure you get it right
[49:07] but i'm sitting there thinking oh lord i
[49:09] like to preach for an hour now
[49:12] okay
[49:19] all right
[49:20] through faith
[49:22] also savor herself
[49:25] first all right
[49:30] receive strength to conceive seed
[49:37] and was delivered of a child when she
[49:38] would pass the age
[49:40] because she judged him faithful
[49:44] who had promised
[49:46] right
[49:53] through faith you can see seed
[49:56] that's what i'm saying we wanted all
[49:58] abraham abraham abraham sarah didn't
[50:01] have nothing
[50:03] all i want to preach about her was if
[50:04] hadn't just been part of abraham god it
[50:06] just killed
[50:11] right her that what you hear free
[50:14] do you ever preach that she was the top
[50:16] of the bride of christ
[50:21] and our abraham is not brother brethren
[50:34] and we're going through a journey
[50:38] to come to the ability of sarah did
[50:42] right
[50:46] so we only counted in abraham like i
[50:48] said he got his change he woke up one
[50:50] morning he looked over
[50:53] it's right reverse the way i say it
[50:55] right
[50:56] you know how i say it he woke up one
[50:57] morning looked over and i was a young
[50:58] woman he said i'm in the wrong bed
[51:03] but
[51:04] see we want to say it hey grant looked
[51:06] over they're saying you know i feel
[51:09] funny you look in the mirror
[51:11] yeah and i woke up the wrong man
[51:14] all right
[51:15] but i'm young that's the way we want it
[51:17] done
[51:19] what do you call that male shoulder this
[51:21] pitch is that the way the word is fart
[51:23] forgive me if i get it wrong
[51:25] on everything late to the man
[51:29] but remember
[51:30] she's the bride
[51:33] and sarah
[51:35] through faith
[51:37] a big long journey that she went through
[51:39] watching abraham
[51:40] he said well
[51:42] i don't understand the coop
[51:44] he's crazy
[51:46] he lets him push him around he doesn't
[51:47] give a lot all this land he's done you i
[51:49] could have been down there with him in
[51:50] that city
[51:54] i'll go with him because i'm his wife
[51:57] like wade said gave her away a couple of
[51:59] times they ain't an argument written no
[52:01] word she said to that guy why did she
[52:03] turn around what'd it be done today
[52:04] wouldn't it right nobody
[52:06] you ain't giving me away i'll have you
[52:08] know it hey king he's my husband
[52:14] was she respecting him
[52:17] that's right
[52:20] because she knew without him she didn't
[52:21] have anything
[52:23] that's right
[52:25] we might want to preach a lot about
[52:26] sarah and their faith
[52:30] because it seems like
[52:35] she had more faith in abraham
[52:37] because abraham lied and give her away
[52:42] and she's willing to give her life to a
[52:44] king
[52:45] to save her a rotten stinking lion
[52:47] husband
[52:50] maybe we want to preach on the saber son
[52:56] the blood of christ
[53:01] maybe she knows more about it he did
[53:05] maybe she knew
[53:07] what he's written about him you know i'm
[53:09] saying about offering up isaac it's
[53:10] written about him that he you know
[53:12] he knew he had had a mess from one from
[53:14] the dead but it's not written about that
[53:15] when when he's given her away a couple
[53:17] of times
[53:20] the only writing about it is this
[53:22] prophet the end time saying
[53:24] god was protecting
[53:26] that vessel
[53:29] because he had done said sarah would be
[53:32] the one that would bring the child amen
[53:34] that's right right
[53:36] do what abraham said say now you're
[53:38] going down there with a man live with
[53:39] him about 20 years and god's going to
[53:40] come along and get you away from him get
[53:42] back to me
[53:46] it ain't in there folks that's right
[53:48] i wanted to preach about an hour or two
[53:50] behind him on wednesday night
[53:54] jesus through faith
[53:57] a journey she traveled through watching
[53:59] that man
[54:00] kept watching that man
[54:03] and seeing who that man was meeting and
[54:04] what was taking place and she was just
[54:06] right there with me
[54:08] and then one day she looks at him he's
[54:10] young and she looks in the mirror and
[54:11] she's young do you realize something
[54:13] took place
[54:17] dennis went now listen because she was
[54:20] made young didn't make her worse you
[54:21] could conceive right
[54:25] when she was young to start with come on
[54:27] read your bible
[54:28] that's what i said maybe we ought to
[54:30] preach a lot like that folks
[54:34] but see after she has turned back young
[54:37] during the time he's giving her away the
[54:39] second time
[54:41] somewhere in there she got the idea
[54:48] that she could conceive
[54:56] so we were to pay close attention to the
[54:58] writing of the bible
[54:59] as i said about the psalmist david then
[55:01] and
[55:02] paul
[55:05] paul is concluding the matter from a
[55:07] born-again experience of saying what the
[55:09] holy spirit was speaking through david
[55:13] and concluded blesses the man to whom
[55:15] god will not impute sin
[55:17] paul is standing in that new birth that
[55:20] new creation
[55:23] as he says in corinthians
[55:26] make you a new creature in christ jesus
[55:29] a new creation so he's standing in that
[55:31] new creation
[55:34] and he knows who
[55:36] he knows he can't go out and live like
[55:38] the devil and get by with it because
[55:41] he's explaining that
[55:45] god forbid if that's what you think
[55:47] that's right
[55:49] he's seeing what's taking place
[55:52] that by the new birth within him
[55:59] right right
[56:03] by the new birth that is within him
[56:07] he's seeing
[56:09] the man
[56:12] that god won't impure sin
[56:18] he can't impute it the prophet said over
[56:20] the token
[56:22] he said because the token is laying
[56:24] there
[56:26] to cover you amen
[56:28] now brother anderson pull those back up
[56:32] because i want you to pay close
[56:33] attention
[56:37] but while he's pulling that up go over
[56:39] to
[56:40] corinthians
[56:43] where's that
[56:45] go to second corinthians while we got
[56:46] this one on the board up here
[56:49] go to second corinthians
[56:53] 10 5 excuse me second corinthians
[56:58] and verse 10.
[57:00] but i want you to watch this reading i
[57:02] said remind me to make sure
[57:05] to come back
[57:10] because now notice
[57:13] david
[57:17] you're talking about transgressions
[57:20] and sins
[57:23] and you know
[57:24] you're talking about the man but you
[57:26] don't bring him to righteousness you
[57:28] bring him into
[57:30] iniquity and iniquity is knowing to do
[57:32] good won't do it you know or he is sin
[57:35] and paul is describing the blessedness
[57:37] and saying that whose iniquities are
[57:38] forgiven whose sins are covered
[57:41] so they're both covering the fact of a
[57:43] covering
[57:45] but paul is looking at the covering as
[57:47] the blood of jesus christ by the new
[57:49] birth right
[57:51] paul is look that david is looking at
[57:53] the covering of the atonement right amen
[57:57] now
[57:57] so let's read here
[57:59] in second corinthians got it
[58:03] 5 10
[58:05] for we must all appear before the
[58:07] judgment seat of christ
[58:11] that everyone may receive the thing
[58:14] receive the things done in his soul
[58:16] according to that he had done
[58:20] oh did i misread that yeah
[58:26] oh what did he say there
[58:29] oh
[58:31] and everyone may receive the things done
[58:33] in his body
[58:36] according to that he had done whether it
[58:39] be good or bad
[58:43] now
[58:45] a lot of difference in your soul your
[58:47] body
[58:48] amen if you're born again believer
[58:52] and have eternal life in your soul you
[58:54] don't have it in your body and your
[58:55] spirit right
[58:58] there can be no imputing of anything
[59:00] within the soul of an individual that's
[59:02] born again right right you agree
[59:04] because that's eternal life you can't
[59:06] impute to god sin so they can't you
[59:09] can't sin we'll get to that later when
[59:11] it says it's seed remain attended we
[59:12] don't have time today
[59:18] so paul says here that it's the deeds in
[59:21] the body
[59:25] there's not going to be a judgment the
[59:27] judgment the white throne judgment is to
[59:29] decide whether or not you give eternal
[59:31] life in your soul right amen right
[59:37] paul is not talking about a decision of
[59:39] eternal life right
[59:40] he's talking about the deep done in the
[59:42] body
[59:46] whether they be you know what and then
[59:48] we rewarded we covered that on the bible
[59:51] study saturday night or last saturday
[59:56] all
[59:58] right paul knows it by the new birth
[1:00:02] there's no way to impute
[1:00:05] sin to the soul of an individual that is
[1:00:08] born again
[1:00:09] christ
[1:00:11] amen
[1:00:14] you agree amen
[1:00:17] but in our bodies in our spirits we do
[1:00:19] wrong
[1:00:21] and we must confess those things here
[1:00:25] our health and through that
[1:00:28] so that's why marriage and divorce had
[1:00:30] to be preached right to clear the body
[1:00:34] or there would have been no flesh saved
[1:00:37] that's right
[1:00:40] all right
[1:00:43] see then you know a christian don't sin
[1:00:46] with his soul
[1:00:48] right
[1:00:51] but his body and his spirit is still
[1:00:54] subject to this world agree
[1:00:59] now
[1:01:01] we need to explain that
[1:01:07] you talk about sin
[1:01:09] right
[1:01:11] the prophet of god says not sin to drink
[1:01:13] smoke
[1:01:15] run around with women
[1:01:18] come home right
[1:01:23] so then the word sin must be divided
[1:01:25] into smaller things and going into
[1:01:27] greater things right or else how are you
[1:01:29] going to understand it
[1:01:35] when paul would speak of the sins of the
[1:01:36] body
[1:01:39] and he'd even say who can deliver me
[1:01:41] from this
[1:01:42] body that i am
[1:01:47] he said with my body i serve the law
[1:01:51] of sin
[1:01:55] but with the inner man i serve the law
[1:01:57] of god amen
[1:01:58] right
[1:02:00] which is what where there is no
[1:02:02] sin all right
[1:02:07] so then a christian brought around said
[1:02:11] and we'll cover these because there's
[1:02:12] two ways you've got to cover it
[1:02:16] a christian cannot sin
[1:02:19] but then he says the christians are what
[1:02:20] it does sin
[1:02:22] now if that ain't answered correctly
[1:02:24] you've got confusion right right
[1:02:28] all right so we'll get to that
[1:02:32] but now
[1:02:35] so we conclude that it's not all right
[1:02:38] to go out and just live like the devil
[1:02:39] in our bodies okay that's right right
[1:02:42] our bodies are supposed to be brought
[1:02:44] under subjection to the one that's
[1:02:45] within us that's right
[1:02:59] eat too much
[1:03:06] but you know what we got to eat
[1:03:09] we just don't have to eat too much
[1:03:12] i probably need two months talking about
[1:03:14] before we go down and eat right
[1:03:16] when he left brother gary back there we
[1:03:18] got a holler leg
[1:03:21] i said one night with that man
[1:03:24] and he got five plates off
[1:03:28] of the salad bar
[1:03:30] it rhymes
[1:03:32] five
[1:03:33] piled up plates
[1:03:37] until hannah finally told him gary i'm
[1:03:39] getting ashamed of you eating
[1:03:42] she was a little girl in
[1:03:45] that was five plates off the salad bar
[1:03:48] that wasn't his meal
[1:03:50] but i had not told him order the biggest
[1:03:53] steak you want
[1:03:55] he got the biggest steak and baked
[1:03:57] potato
[1:03:58] and all that ryan's had to go on top of
[1:04:00] the five plates
[1:04:03] i think that's eating too much now
[1:04:06] don't judge me there now but
[1:04:09] i think that's meant
[1:04:11] little bit too much all right maybe four
[1:04:14] plates
[1:04:17] my brother mold had a way of saying it
[1:04:20] he said
[1:04:22] a water pipe three-quarter inch or a
[1:04:24] 55-gallon drum you can only fill it up
[1:04:29] oh that's gonna come out yeah after so
[1:04:31] long all right
[1:04:35] is it a sin to be a husband and wife
[1:04:39] you're gonna be a slack world i'm you
[1:04:41] know haven't even been on the monster
[1:04:47] is it a sin for a husband and wife to
[1:04:50] desire each other
[1:04:54] no it's a sin for you to desire the
[1:04:56] neighbor
[1:04:58] right
[1:04:59] that's right
[1:05:01] come on so we providing sin
[1:05:06] anything's not a faith about what's any
[1:05:08] sin right right
[1:05:10] but yet life is
[1:05:13] life
[1:05:14] we have to eat we have to sleep
[1:05:17] we have to work
[1:05:20] we have to do all of these things right
[1:05:21] there
[1:05:23] let's not sin
[1:05:25] right yeah we can make it sin right but
[1:05:28] what we do with it that's right that's
[1:05:29] right
[1:05:31] all right so you understand what i'm
[1:05:32] saying
[1:05:35] and with the soul of a born-again
[1:05:36] believer he cannot sin
[1:05:39] because god is dwelling within him
[1:05:47] but our bodies and spirit is in the
[1:05:48] world that we're controlled by
[1:05:53] and we've got problems
[1:05:55] and we allow those things to override
[1:05:57] yes
[1:06:01] you remember the man that in the hebrew
[1:06:03] series that
[1:06:04] the preacher
[1:06:06] he just got fed up with it
[1:06:08] probably about like i do about two or
[1:06:10] three times every day
[1:06:12] but he got gets fed up with it so much
[1:06:14] until he just finally
[1:06:17] he sits down quick
[1:06:20] how do you get somebody else get him
[1:06:21] some beer
[1:06:22] though says i ain't buying a preacher a
[1:06:24] beer or something that degree
[1:06:26] two weeks later he died and went from
[1:06:27] heaven
[1:06:28] but around said he couldn't let god
[1:06:30] couldn't let his child marry his name
[1:06:32] but now you see somebody living 20 years
[1:06:35] they claim they backflip 20 years ago
[1:06:37] and they're still christians i don't
[1:06:39] like that idea i don't agree with it
[1:06:42] now if you do that's all right i'm naive
[1:06:44] but i'm not that naive right
[1:06:47] you know i believe people but not quite
[1:06:49] that much
[1:06:50] short period right because the bible
[1:06:53] says
[1:06:54] the day you find out this you get rid of
[1:06:56] it
[1:06:57] right
[1:06:58] don't mean your later see
[1:07:00] that's right you just decreasing anybody
[1:07:02] no
[1:07:03] no
[1:07:04] i don't de-christianize anybody that's
[1:07:05] right you do it yourself
[1:07:08] that's right
[1:07:10] yes sir and she's like what wait reading
[1:07:12] that list off
[1:07:13] about the ones he was going to be
[1:07:14] praying for some of your children's on
[1:07:16] that list
[1:07:17] you get mad because he read your child's
[1:07:19] name i got one answer do you not want
[1:07:23] your children saved
[1:07:25] do you not want your family that's right
[1:07:27] something wrong with you
[1:07:30] you would have been the one to come and
[1:07:31] put your name on
[1:07:32] the list
[1:07:34] brother came to me as a service and he
[1:07:36] said i want my name put on there amen
[1:07:40] i don't know whether i'm saved or not
[1:07:43] i said brother keep on going
[1:07:46] all right i said we got a man here for a
[1:07:48] year saw god i said you've got another
[1:07:50] one that's speaking to you for two years
[1:07:52] that's all god about the new birth you
[1:07:54] don't give up
[1:07:56] you get upset because your name
[1:07:58] your child's name is called
[1:08:01] you better remember one thing you've got
[1:08:03] the wrong spirit right now that's your
[1:08:05] pastor said whether you like it or not
[1:08:07] that's right
[1:08:08] because that's the way it is you don't
[1:08:10] want your family saved well i think my
[1:08:12] family is you know my story i try to go
[1:08:15] all of my life seeking god
[1:08:18] get it to end and find out i got it then
[1:08:20] i'm not sick of it all to get that find
[1:08:22] out i didn't have
[1:08:34] that's attributes of your flesh
[1:08:36] that is caused by your spirit
[1:08:39] because your flesh is totally useless
[1:08:42] without the spirit to motivate it right
[1:08:47] the
[1:08:49] inner soul of an individual that's born
[1:08:51] again they cannot sin
[1:08:53] that's right
[1:08:57] within our spirit and our bodies we can
[1:09:00] alright
[1:09:02] now i want to conclude one
[1:09:04] thing all right
[1:09:10] let me ask you a question
[1:09:15] okay am i ready
[1:09:19] who's the man that god wanted you to sin
[1:09:21] now don't say jesus
[1:09:23] right and then told you when i started
[1:09:24] it the other day don't say jesus
[1:09:27] i'm not talking about it
[1:09:30] who's the man woman whoever you want to
[1:09:32] say man means mankind
[1:09:34] women men
[1:09:36] who is the person that god will not
[1:09:39] impute sin
[1:09:47] it's not jesus
[1:09:49] that's right
[1:09:51] that's right
[1:09:54] as i said you're gonna get a shot can i
[1:09:56] say that's what i'm fixing to say
[1:10:00] anything but one person
[1:10:02] that god won't impute sin
[1:10:08] and that's a person that's dead
[1:10:11] i wanted that answer from somebody
[1:10:13] didn't get it
[1:10:17] you can't impute sin to a dead man
[1:10:23] would you like the quote
[1:10:27] my daddy's been dead since 1945 could
[1:10:30] you accuse him of committing a crime
[1:10:32] yesterday or today
[1:10:34] no because he's dead
[1:10:37] now you say but i thought it's a new
[1:10:39] blessing
[1:10:40] the only way you can have the new birth
[1:10:43] see that's where the key was missing
[1:10:45] amen you thought about the new birth and
[1:10:47] you got that right okay
[1:10:49] but you didn't think about you got to be
[1:10:51] dead before you'd be born again
[1:10:54] that's right you've got to be dead
[1:10:56] before you can be born again that is the
[1:10:59] man that god won't impuke sin to he's a
[1:11:01] dead man
[1:11:02] amen that's right amen
[1:11:06] it's not i that liveth but christ that
[1:11:07] liveth in me
[1:11:10] how many of you won't have run around
[1:11:11] say dead to sin but alive in jesus
[1:11:14] christ amen that's right
[1:11:18] dead men don't sin
[1:11:21] you say with a new birth but you've got
[1:11:23] to die before you get the new birth
[1:11:24] you're missing that point
[1:11:28] there's your journey of justification
[1:11:29] and sanctification if you're dying
[1:11:36] dying after yourself right amen
[1:11:40] to be made alive in jesus christ that's
[1:11:42] right you never heard brother brown say
[1:11:44] we baptized he's talking about buried
[1:11:46] but he said baptized too many alive
[1:11:48] people
[1:11:49] that's right is that a quote
[1:11:52] that's right
[1:11:56] that's right
[1:11:57] the dead man's only man that can't sin
[1:12:01] you've got to be dead before you can be
[1:12:02] born again that's what paul said now
[1:12:04] let's get it for a minute real quick
[1:12:06] paul said in corinthians that can make
[1:12:08] you a new creature
[1:12:11] right
[1:12:12] a new creation right
[1:12:14] i got a quotation who wrote around said
[1:12:16] he won't impute sins of this creed this
[1:12:18] creature
[1:12:22] you can cut them out of service with it
[1:12:24] didn't put them up
[1:12:27] you can't impute sin over the token
[1:12:30] he said because the token is laying
[1:12:32] there which is the life of god living in
[1:12:34] your soul but you had to die to be able
[1:12:37] to be born again
[1:12:39] that's right and when you died you
[1:12:41] didn't come forth the same person if you
[1:12:43] did there's something wrong
[1:12:46] that's why we don't die a lot of times
[1:12:48] we just get baptized we go through
[1:12:49] justification sanctification we get an
[1:12:51] anointing upon our spirit that's right
[1:12:55] yes sir
[1:12:58] we get an anointing on our spirit we go
[1:13:00] to church we glory hallelujah shout and
[1:13:02] feel good
[1:13:03] and then we died
[1:13:05] that's right that's it
[1:13:11] you had a brother calling wade did the
[1:13:12] brother dick number pinched in wednesday
[1:13:14] or something you know that's just to
[1:13:16] show that we're still alive out here
[1:13:21] now you didn't die physically to get the
[1:13:23] new birth
[1:13:24] that's not what we're talking about all
[1:13:26] right
[1:13:31] we die spiritually
[1:13:35] right
[1:13:38] will you tell me any other word for it
[1:13:42] justification and sanctification
[1:13:45] cleans the vessel but it don't destroy
[1:13:47] it
[1:13:49] that's right go to the future home and
[1:13:51] read it
[1:13:53] he says it takes the fiery baptism to
[1:13:56] clean out what's left
[1:14:01] sanctification cleanse and set aside you
[1:14:04] say well what's left me and you
[1:14:07] that's what's left
[1:14:09] and what we need to do is die of
[1:14:12] ourselves
[1:14:16] and that's right because right after
[1:14:17] that jim jones situation years ago you
[1:14:20] remember where all them people killed
[1:14:21] herself
[1:14:23] and they they asked fred hooper down at
[1:14:25] work one day said
[1:14:26] is sam are trying to
[1:14:28] trying to get you to kill yourself he
[1:14:30] said he's been trying to get me to kill
[1:14:31] myself ever since i've known him
[1:14:58] that's right
[1:15:00] i know you don't like me that's what i
[1:15:02] do people look down at the coffin and
[1:15:04] they say
[1:15:05] and i know you're honest i'm not
[1:15:07] throwing off on it you say well don't he
[1:15:08] look good no he's dead all right
[1:15:11] all right
[1:15:13] that's right i know what you're talking
[1:15:15] about the undertaker's done the best you
[1:15:16] can do to fix him up
[1:15:19] but he's dead
[1:15:22] well you know what that's what i want to
[1:15:23] be that's right
[1:15:26] now my flesh and my spirit is what's
[1:15:27] still alive
[1:15:30] there's what i have to give an account
[1:15:32] for them things it's done in my body and
[1:15:34] my spirit
[1:15:35] my soul is born
[1:15:41] paul said make him a new creature
[1:15:44] a new creation
[1:15:46] brother branham says
[1:15:48] you want these quotes
[1:15:50] not the old creation made over
[1:15:57] that's why everybody wanted to say you
[1:15:58] had to be some kind of get a new bodies
[1:16:00] and all this at the other
[1:16:03] no he's talking about the soul dying
[1:16:08] and the holy ghost coming in to live
[1:16:15] that's the person
[1:16:16] that god won't impute
[1:16:18] sin you see if i go out and do things
[1:16:21] wrong in my body today you know what
[1:16:23] he'll impute that because if i don't get
[1:16:25] rid of it he's going to make me answer
[1:16:26] one day right so now you see david and
[1:16:28] you paul you see what they were doing
[1:16:31] we got a recovery we got an advocate
[1:16:32] we're the father we can't die and go to
[1:16:34] hell if we're born again
[1:16:36] you can't sin enough to go to hell if
[1:16:37] you're born again
[1:16:38] but if you're born again you ain't gonna
[1:16:40] want to sin right amen you'll be
[1:16:41] condemned immediately and quit that's
[1:16:43] right
[1:16:44] right that's right because we don't god
[1:16:47] let's take us off the scene that's right
[1:16:52] what do you think about it
[1:16:55] we need to be dead that's right
[1:16:59] because that's the qualifications to get
[1:17:02] the baptism in the holy ghost right amen
[1:17:04] that's right
[1:17:06] it's for us to be willing to die out to
[1:17:08] ourselves
[1:17:13] and let him come and live
[1:17:17] not turning over a new leaf
[1:17:19] that's right that's justifications thank
[1:17:20] you that's correct
[1:17:23] repent and get rid of this don't do it
[1:17:25] that's wonderful
[1:17:28] but are we dead
[1:17:32] you know
[1:17:35] the bread around says
[1:17:38] we don't have any rights
[1:17:42] hungry
[1:17:47] is that true right amen we don't have
[1:17:50] any rights to think
[1:17:51] we don't have any rights of anything
[1:17:53] right if we're christians right
[1:17:58] a lamb we forfeit our rights
[1:18:00] we give up everything that we got
[1:18:06] notice the prophets did we marry too
[1:18:08] many people that are not dead
[1:18:12] what's wrong with the church pews today
[1:18:15] people sitting in them they're not
[1:18:17] needed
[1:18:18] right
[1:18:19] they're religious
[1:18:21] they want to go to church and be good
[1:18:23] that's all it's sanctification
[1:18:26] that's correct amen
[1:18:28] i didn't have as much trouble with the
[1:18:29] world when i was i'm talking about the
[1:18:31] world when i got sanctified in the
[1:18:32] baptist church and i know i did because
[1:18:34] the lord took away the desires right and
[1:18:36] the problems i had
[1:18:37] i didn't have as much trouble dealing
[1:18:39] with this old body as i do now right
[1:18:41] sure you know why because satan knows
[1:18:43] he's going to lose it pretty quick
[1:18:46] one way or the other like brother carol
[1:18:47] said
[1:18:48] he said i'm 80 years old so it doesn't
[1:18:50] matter to me whether i've changed or
[1:18:52] died he said because on that's it's
[1:18:54] pretty quick for me
[1:18:56] well
[1:19:01] but you know if we die
[1:19:03] you can live
[1:19:05] that's right
[1:19:12] let me die
[1:19:14] that he might live
[1:19:19] what does paul say
[1:19:23] he that is dead how can he live any
[1:19:24] longer they're in
[1:19:26] paul speaks a lot about it brought a
[1:19:28] reference sometime on just being dead
[1:19:30] right
[1:19:31] you know
[1:19:32] die out yourself for being born again or
[1:19:35] whatever just run reference especially
[1:19:36] with brother brown
[1:19:38] and just see what he's talking about
[1:19:39] right
[1:19:40] he's talking about how that we must die
[1:19:45] he said that old
[1:19:48] william brown
[1:19:50] right
[1:19:54] he said he died
[1:19:59] what about it right amen what do we
[1:20:02] think about it
[1:20:07] our sister just wants to be more dead
[1:20:09] than she's ever been
[1:20:13] is that all of her desires
[1:20:16] father you heard her sister
[1:20:19] heffer to just die out to herself
[1:20:22] and let you live
[1:20:24] lord then that'll take care of all
[1:20:26] things
[1:20:28] the deader we are the more alive you can
[1:20:30] be
[1:20:31] we love you and we thank you
[1:20:33] we just commit everything to you and lay
[1:20:35] our hands upon our sister believe in you
[1:20:37] that you'll help her to die
[1:20:39] just die yourself
[1:20:41] and come forth in you
[1:20:44] because it's a death all the way through
[1:20:46] the christian life then
[1:20:48] we die out of ourselves and get born
[1:20:49] again then there's a death through our
[1:20:51] life
[1:20:52] and we just keep dying out
[1:20:54] clean it out all in places that
[1:20:56] is not needed
[1:20:58] we love you and we thank you thank you

[1:24:45] i mean even just looking around you know
[1:24:46] not a lot of years left for a lot of us
[1:24:48] anyway that's right that's right
[1:24:50] and you know what if they're not a few
[1:24:52] left for a lot of it a lot of you don't
[1:24:54] catch up with us
[1:24:55] there won't be much left
[1:24:58] that's right but what are we going to
[1:24:59] believe
[1:25:00] and just accept that's right
[1:25:02] that's it
[1:25:04] and just pray and say lord let me die
[1:25:08] just let me die
[1:25:10] until i'm so dead and doing nothing
[1:25:11] bothering me
[1:25:15] and that's what we need
[1:25:19] and then we need to just listen
[1:25:22] to god
[1:25:24] let him direct
[1:25:26] amen
[1:25:27] i started to get up the other day to go
[1:25:28] hunt i still don't know the answer
[1:25:30] i started to go hunting
[1:25:33] don't say don't go
[1:25:37] don't go
[1:25:42] i said well
[1:25:43] hey lord
[1:25:46] is it you or whatever
[1:25:49] is it me just afraid
[1:25:51] you know to go or what is it what's the
[1:25:53] trouble
[1:25:54] i don't know
[1:25:58] i just parade went crow back into bed
[1:26:00] and said forget it
[1:26:04] you want to be more concerned
[1:26:08] and then pray
[1:26:10] right that's right lord wakes you up in
[1:26:12] the middle of the night somebody comes
[1:26:13] on your mind pray about it
[1:26:16] right
[1:26:17] call our name
[1:26:19] pray about
[1:26:20] it to be with that person that's right

[1:26:26] is being done
[1:26:28] you never know what god is taking care
[1:26:29] of
[1:26:31] in the line of where you're at yep
[1:26:38] think of these things are we dead enough
[1:26:43] because i thought the bible said
[1:26:45] that the dead in christ
[1:26:49] she'll rise first
[1:26:51] right
[1:26:53] now houses can be dead and crushing
[1:26:55] there's no way that you
[1:26:56] you can't be in christ and die so it's
[1:26:58] not saying that right
[1:27:00] you can't be in christ a christian don't
[1:27:02] die
[1:27:03] what's it saying
[1:27:08] because every born-again believer
[1:27:12] that went down
[1:27:14] died in christ
[1:27:30] father we thank you for this day we ask
[1:27:32] you this bless
[1:27:33] us with your love and understanding to

[1:27:40] lord lead us by that understanding and
[1:27:42] bless us as everybody out there listens
[1:27:44] may they just not life and say well what
[1:27:47] kind of a sermon was that
[1:27:50] but may they search in their hearts
[1:27:53] to learn that we need to die
[1:27:56] because some will do that some will like
[1:27:58] and say what a simple thing why anybody
[1:28:01] can know we can die but lord
[1:28:04] we need to die
[1:28:07] that you might live
[1:28:09] blessed and god each and every one of us
[1:28:11] go with us now we need a natural meal we
[1:28:13] ask your father you just sanctify this
[1:28:15] food that we all may fellowship together
[1:28:18] and lord may it be in you that we eat
[1:28:20] and have our being we love you and we
