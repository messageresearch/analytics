[0:14] you're looking at the video camera i'm
[0:16] pointing over there and nobody's seeing
[0:17] over there
[0:18] so we don't have split cameras down here
[0:20] like they're downstairs when they bring
[0:22] quotes up so i want you to see the quote
[0:23] part
[0:25] anyway so let's turn to second peter
[0:27] let's read
[0:29] or we were starting there
[0:31] or bless you good to have our visitor

[0:48] have anything to say about him you
[0:49] better tell her
[0:52] she's here

[0:57] list like zero confusing good good she's

[1:04] cause we're out here she he doesn't have

[1:15] that's what bob's dad always tells me
[1:18] he said brother and brother said love my
[1:20] family yes and thank god for loving yep
[1:33] all right patience now we're going to
[1:34] read 2nd peter 1
[1:39] and we're now on patience
[1:42] patience is a what patience is a virtue
[1:45] come on work happy jeremiah
[2:02] that's another perk mom can get i don't
[2:05] know i'm still with you when you're 50
[2:07] years old
[2:11] right in front of her huh what's he
[2:13] doing oh okay
[2:15] that's fine didn't hurt anybody
[2:17] the computer one
[2:22] according as his divine nature have
[2:24] given unto us all things that pertain
[2:26] unto life and godliness so that's what
[2:28] we're talking about we're talking about
[2:30] life
[2:31] the life that we live
[2:32] and the godliness in our life through
[2:36] the knowledge of him that have called us
[2:38] to glory and virtue
[2:40] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[2:42] great and precious promises that by
[2:43] these you might be protected from the
[2:45] divine nature having escaped the
[2:46] corruption that is in the world through
[2:48] lust
[2:49] and besides this giving all diligence
[2:51] add to your faith virtue
[2:53] and the virtue knowledge the knowledge
[2:55] temperance and tempers patience the
[2:57] patience godliness so now we are on
[2:59] patience
[3:01] just kind of re reviewing a little bit
[3:04] now that i got this on my ipad i can
[3:11] that makes you agree everybody
[3:15] all right
[3:17] this is what i like here steadfastness
[3:21] constancy constant
[3:23] endurance
[3:24] in the new testament the characteristics
[3:26] of a man remember the word patience is
[3:28] not even mentioned in the old
[3:30] testament the first word patience uses
[3:33] in like the book of matthew
[3:36] so
[3:37] it's a hard thing to have it was hard
[3:39] for
[3:39] for moses he had patience but but this
[3:42] we're talking about godly patients from
[3:44] the new birth something coming from the
[3:46] inside and working its way out
[3:48] but in the new testament the
[3:50] characteristics of a man who has not
[3:51] swerved from his deliberate purpose
[3:54] and his loyalty to faith and piety by
[3:56] even the greatest trials and sufferings
[4:00] because remember
[4:02] tribulation work it patience
[4:05] if you don't if everything goes along
[4:06] just smooth and hunky-dory all the time
[4:09] what would you need patience for
[4:11] so i said about faith you're not gonna
[4:12] need faith over in glory
[4:15] you're going to be faith
[4:17] but we need faith now
[4:20] because we have to believe something we
[4:21] can't see
[4:23] but when we can see it
[4:25] i don't need faith
[4:27] that june is
[4:29] is going to come to church and be born
[4:30] again
[4:31] she's already there i don't have to have
[4:32] faith for that
[4:35] i have to have faith with my kids
[4:36] because they're not come to that point
[4:39] so we got to have
[4:40] faith for patience
[4:44] and when it comes guess what you add
[4:46] that to
[4:48] then you go again you add that to we
[4:50] were talking last sunday about
[4:52] tribulation tribulation working
[4:56] because if you start into a trial
[4:59] you start into a trial
[5:01] and you backslide and go out in the
[5:03] world or whatever you're going to do
[5:06] then you know one thing's for sure
[5:08] you're not steadfast you're not constant
[5:10] you're not enduring
[5:13] paul said i run this race
[5:15] he was going to run it to win
[5:17] he wasn't going running just just to
[5:19] just to get to the halfway point
[5:22] he run the race with what patience
[5:25] that's what we must have is patience
[5:27] even in our
[5:29] even in our trials look at noah we were
[5:31] using some examples last sunday look at
[5:33] noah
[5:34] noah preached 120 years the same message
[5:36] now he didn't say the same thing over
[5:37] and over again but his message was it's
[5:39] going to rain you need to get make a
[5:41] provision get in this ark get in this do
[5:43] this
[5:44] um
[5:45] you know know god for 120 years
[5:48] well none of us even even live 120 years
[5:51] but he preached for 120 years
[5:53] then when god put him in the ark
[5:56] it did instantly start raining
[5:59] it was seven more days that he had to
[6:01] sit in that steamy stinky ark with all
[6:03] them
[6:04] animals before
[6:07] one drop of rain ever fell
[6:09] so noah had to have patience
[6:12] he was steadfast
[6:14] i'm sure his kids as the prophet said
[6:16] his kids will say daddy you sure he said
[6:18] it'll rain
[6:20] it will rain you know why because
[6:22] noah got a revelation
[6:24] from god that's the difference when you
[6:26] get a revelation you can stand on
[6:28] abraham got a revelation that he was
[6:30] going to have a child brother brown said
[6:31] it was like he already had a child
[6:33] that's what you and i must have faith he
[6:35] said well i don't see anything well
[6:37] abraham didn't see nothing and as his
[6:39] years got longer and older
[6:42] it looked worse
[6:46] but the bible says he work
[6:47] stronger in faith in other words when he
[6:49] got to where he knew he couldn't do it
[6:52] himself see that's when god took over
[6:54] that's what we were talking about
[6:55] somebody will talk the other day about
[6:57] persecution and things
[6:58] um
[7:00] why are we we're not persecuted yet
[7:04] so the bible says there's ease in zion
[7:07] and that's what it is we just so easy
[7:09] till
[7:10] um
[7:12] the persecution is going to have to
[7:15] drive us or pull us
[7:18] into
[7:20] waiting on god and
[7:23] being perseverant
[7:25] persevere
[7:27] all right
[7:29] the next one there's another one here
[7:30] it's from the greek word
[7:33] be of long spirit
[7:36] not to lose heart that's what our
[7:37] problem is we lose heart sometimes
[7:39] because god doesn't bring it to us right
[7:41] then
[7:43] we do
[7:45] well that means we're impatient
[7:48] not patient we're impatient
[7:51] now the first thing brother brown i'm
[7:52] going to read you a quote today the
[7:53] first thing he said to do was be patient
[7:55] with who
[7:56] god
[7:57] not with yourself not with your neighbor
[7:59] no your mom dad wife
[8:02] he said be patient with god because
[8:03] that's the first man you better be
[8:04] patient with sure right right that's the
[8:07] first person you better be patient with
[8:10] because remember brother brown preached
[8:12] a message running without a message
[8:15] that's why he said power without
[8:16] character satanic we've got the power
[8:19] we've got the power of the word that no
[8:21] one on the face of the earth except
[8:22] jesus christ himself had and listen let
[8:25] me make this statement even jesus jesus
[8:28] had the power but it wasn't for only him
[8:31] to give out so he only had three and a
[8:33] half years he didn't have 50 years 60
[8:35] years 80 years
[8:37] he had three and a half years to preach
[8:41] three and a half years that's all of the
[8:44] most powerful message
[8:45] but you and i have been given an
[8:47] opportunity 30 40 years what are we
[8:49] doing with it
[8:50] like i said last sunday you got people
[8:52] being a message 30 40 years and you go
[8:54] preach for them or
[8:55] or you make a statement they look at you
[8:57] like
[8:59] where'd you get that at
[9:02] that shouldn't be
[9:04] our lives
[9:06] should be encompassed with the message
[9:08] we should we should be able to if
[9:10] somebody talks about logos or theophany
[9:12] or or genesis 1 26 and i know there's
[9:15] other things that needs to be revealed
[9:16] of all these things but at least we
[9:18] should have a general knowledge that we
[9:20] need to be born again and then these
[9:22] virtues have to be birthed into our life
[9:24] then we have to come to the faith of the
[9:25] fathers then we have to come to the
[9:27] headstone before there's even a change
[9:29] people preach the change of the body
[9:30] just like it's just like it's a you know
[9:33] it's like it's just
[9:34] you know it's just well it's just a
[9:36] change of the body this is just
[9:37] chapstick
[9:39] well there was a process to get this
[9:40] chapstick
[9:42] it wasn't born inside this tube
[9:46] man had to put the chemicals together he
[9:47] had to put all these things together he
[9:49] had to manufacture the cube he had to
[9:51] get this stuff in it before it became
[9:52] chapstick same way with the message
[9:55] the message is not just given
[9:57] just to say well one day the body is
[9:59] going to be changed
[10:01] i don't believe that i believe there's a
[10:03] step brother brown said god had a plan
[10:05] and a purpose well you know what a plan
[10:06] and a purpose is you sit down and you
[10:08] map out what you're going to do
[10:10] that's a plan
[10:12] and the purpose was is he was going to
[10:14] have me and you become
[10:16] into the image of god that's true power
[10:18] without character is satanic power is
[10:21] the new verb
[10:22] in your birth but then you have to come
[10:24] up with that what's without you
[10:27] that's correct
[10:28] because you look at you take examples of
[10:31] i was reading it the other day where
[10:32] peter
[10:33] paul had a contention with peter paul
[10:35] had a contention with barnabas they were
[10:37] all born again people
[10:39] peter was had all these virtues in his
[10:41] life but yet he had a problem because
[10:43] paul had to call him down on something
[10:45] we still have that human nature that we
[10:47] have to deal with
[10:48] all right and brother brown talked about
[10:50] the the uh
[10:51] the preacher that they said i'm not
[10:52] preaching anymore i'm just gonna go get
[10:55] some beer and just you know in other
[10:56] words well you know
[10:58] brother brown never called him lost
[11:01] he said god took his son home so he
[11:02] wouldn't marry his name that he got a
[11:04] devil on him
[11:07] he got a devil on him and that devil
[11:09] drove him to do that but yet he was
[11:11] still born again
[11:13] because remember we have that dualness
[11:16] we have the spirit of ourself and we
[11:18] have the
[11:19] the uh i like what brother ulti said one
[11:21] time and it really
[11:23] it really strikes if you'll listen to
[11:25] what he was saying
[11:26] listen with some understanding he said
[11:29] the soul is telling you one thing but
[11:31] that spirit lays so close to that soul
[11:34] till it filters
[11:37] it filters through that spirit and it
[11:39] gets deluded
[11:40] because if you're born again why don't
[11:42] we still do things wrong or bad or i'm
[11:44] not talking about
[11:46] if you do things
[11:48] you don't commit adultery then i would
[11:49] assume you do it two or three times you
[11:51] lost
[11:52] you know you understand what i'm saying
[11:54] so you're lost
[11:56] uh if you keep doing something you're
[11:57] not supposed to do and forgive me lord
[11:59] only works maybe one or two times
[12:02] uh forgive me lord don't worry you know
[12:03] well i smoked that cigarette yesterday
[12:05] well forgive me lord then two weeks
[12:06] later i smoked another cigarette forgive
[12:08] me lord i smoke no don't forget that
[12:10] don't work you're lost you're born again
[12:13] all right but now when we're talking
[12:14] about these we're talking about a
[12:15] born-again person but that memory reason
[12:17] conscious and affection lays so close to
[12:19] that soul
[12:21] till it filters or dilutes what god says
[12:24] remember brother brown said he's flu
[12:25] your food can't stop that right
[12:27] look at abraham
[12:29] i mean i mean look at adam adam was a uh
[12:32] if you would say anybody had a pure mind
[12:34] adam had a pure mind right
[12:36] adam didn't have the the cares of the
[12:39] world and he didn't have a job to worry
[12:42] about and he didn't have at that time a
[12:44] bunch of kids to worry about
[12:46] it was just him and his wife
[12:50] would he do as a son of god as a
[12:52] as a being a representative of christ on
[12:55] earth
[12:56] what'd he do
[12:58] sold the whole human race out we put it
[13:00] all on eve but
[13:02] adam's the one that sold us out and i
[13:04] know what he did he sold us out for
[13:06] because of love
[13:09] but he still sold us out he still took
[13:10] his wife back that he'd been with the
[13:12] beast now that would be kind of hard for
[13:13] us to do
[13:15] you understand what i'm saying
[13:17] but
[13:18] patience
[13:21] have long be long suffering
[13:24] i think this is a lot of our problem is
[13:27] is that we're not patient but i promise
[13:29] you one thing when god knocks all the
[13:30] props out and he says i'm going to do
[13:32] something
[13:33] then that's when you've got to have
[13:34] patience with god that's what abraham
[13:36] did abraham could produce with hagar he
[13:39] could produce
[13:40] an ishmael
[13:42] so in other words let's be plain he
[13:43] could sexually reproduce
[13:45] even when he was 70
[13:47] but as he got closer to the 99 he knew
[13:50] he couldn't
[13:52] and he knew sarah was dead before her
[13:54] woman was dead before when they first
[13:56] got married because they never had
[13:57] children
[13:58] so it come to the very total
[13:59] impossibility that one day abraham just
[14:01] said
[14:02] i just believe he said the whole time he
[14:04] said god i
[14:06] obviously i can't produce this
[14:08] you're gonna have to come on the scene
[14:09] and do it well that's exactly what you
[14:11] and i are gonna have to do is we're
[14:12] gonna say god we can't produce this
[14:14] there's no way we can
[14:15] we can you know amass enough money and
[14:18] people want to start putting up this and
[14:19] putting up silver and gold and
[14:22] i was reading an article yesterday and
[14:24] uh not yesterday day four yesterday in
[14:26] the on the internet that within 25 years
[14:29] gold may be worthless
[14:31] because man will be able to almost
[14:33] reproduce gold
[14:36] and it will make true real gold almost
[14:38] worthless in 25 years
[14:40] so what are you going to do with that
[14:43] well god's going to put them on the
[14:44] streets and we're going to walk on them
[14:47] but man kills each other for it
[14:50] and we're going to you know that's what
[14:51] remember the old saying about peter you
[14:52] know you
[14:53] come up to the
[14:55] come up to the uh
[14:57] to the gate or the man come up to the
[14:58] gate and peter said what do you got and
[15:00] he said
[15:01] oh my god he brought a bag of gold with
[15:03] him when he died and peter said oh you
[15:05] brought pavement
[15:07] well that's what it is i mean god gold
[15:09] is pavement yeah you know something to
[15:11] walk on but we
[15:13] but see what god's doing he's letting
[15:14] man
[15:15] break into god's laboratory he's letting
[15:17] man
[15:19] try to reproduce something
[15:20] to make us live longer to make us do
[15:22] this
[15:24] sorry we're all dying
[15:26] we're all getting older we all proven
[15:28] that every day of our life so let's have
[15:29] patience let's persevere
[15:33] even paul the great apostle paul the
[15:35] great ones back then peter
[15:37] i think they longed to see the coming of
[15:40] the lord but remember it was revealed to
[15:42] paul
[15:43] that the lord wasn't coming in this time
[15:45] it was revealed to him so paul knew that
[15:47] he had to run a race with patients
[15:49] preaching every service knowing that he
[15:52] was going to go by the grave he wasn't
[15:53] going to see the resurrection while he
[15:56] was still alive right yeah right he had
[15:59] a revelation remember that brother brown
[16:00] said that he was he remember the other
[16:02] the two brothers i can't remember their
[16:04] name but they were preaching that the
[16:05] resurrection was passed and they got uh
[16:08] cephas or not one secret but somebody
[16:10] else but they were preaching that that
[16:12] the resurrection had passed well who'd
[16:13] they get it from they got it from paul
[16:15] because paul gets up and he preaches a
[16:17] resurrection in christ
[16:19] they took it as a literal resurrection
[16:21] and he had to condemn it he said no
[16:23] don't it's not going to happen now
[16:25] put that away don't do that like brother
[16:27] branham when the seals were open he said
[16:30] go on with the same simple message this
[16:31] is not even for you this is the lord
[16:34] just gone from me this is for another
[16:35] generation
[16:37] well what patience did that man have for
[16:39] two more years he preached his heart out
[16:42] knowing that nobody was getting it
[16:44] sitting where he was preaching
[16:46] but he knew he had patience that a
[16:48] future generation was going to come up
[16:50] that was going to take what he said and
[16:52] sweep it on to the coming of the lord so
[16:53] he had patience
[16:55] i've always wondered you know you
[16:57] being a minister
[16:58] and i think i'm preaching now instead of
[17:00] doing something
[17:02] but as a minister you
[17:04] you want to think when you preach to 100
[17:06] people that at least 99 get it
[17:11] that's being optimistic
[17:16] but
[17:17] having patience you know that only about
[17:19] 20 is going to get it
[17:21] hoping that the other 80
[17:24] god will deal with your heart and
[17:26] you understand what i'm saying think
[17:28] about brother brown i'm preaching to
[17:29] hundreds
[17:30] and thousands
[17:32] and he knew by their spirit they weren't
[17:34] getting it he knew by their spirit they
[17:36] were there asked brother george canada
[17:38] well none of him but asked joseph to
[17:40] tell you what brother george said
[17:43] about going to the services brother mode
[17:45] even they testified we went to see the
[17:47] signs and wonders didn't even didn't
[17:49] even matter
[17:51] what was being said i'm sure they
[17:53] shouted and praised the lord and said
[17:54] brother ram has a good message
[17:57] waiting for the signs and wonders to
[17:59] come right
[18:01] they were looking at the signs and
[18:02] wonders
[18:03] they didn't see the message
[18:05] so brother brown knew they weren't
[18:06] seeing the message that's why
[18:08] that's why the uh angel of the lord said
[18:11] said brother around quit explaining it
[18:12] quit trying to explain that you know
[18:14] what i believe he was saying look this
[18:16] is the bait on the hook but this is not
[18:18] your message right right
[18:19] it's a bait on the hook but it's not
[18:20] your message this is not your message
[18:22] don't quit trying to teach the
[18:24] pentecostal babies supernatural things
[18:26] he was wanting to get into a
[18:27] supernatural realm
[18:29] well what about patience that's what i'm
[18:30] talking about patience brother branham i
[18:32] didn't just quit
[18:34] if if the lord revealed to me in 1963
[18:37] that nobody's going to get this message
[18:40] nobody's going to get it you're going to
[18:41] preach it it's going to be on tape but
[18:43] another group is going to get it what
[18:44] patience that made that man get up every
[18:46] day and do the same thing he preached
[18:48] just as hard after 63 as he did before
[18:50] 63. so it didn't it bothered him in his
[18:53] humanity but he had patience he endured
[18:57] until god got finished with him and then
[18:58] he knew that he was going to have to go
[19:00] because the great one jesus christ was
[19:02] going to take over so i think brother
[19:04] brown knew that he had to plant those
[19:06] seeds
[19:07] or that scene right that the uh
[19:09] fightful ministry would take that crop
[19:12] and feed us now well he read the
[19:14] scripture just like we do it didn't say
[19:16] one messenger was going to do it all
[19:19] said you had to have a five-fold
[19:20] ministry to perfect the same
[19:23] well now he was a prophet
[19:24] you go over there to revelations 10 7
[19:27] when the book was taken out of the hand
[19:29] it wasn't taken out of the seventh angel
[19:31] messenger's hand
[19:34] read it
[19:36] john took the book out of the angel's
[19:38] hand that came down and put one foot on
[19:40] went on see who was that christ
[19:42] brother branham was injected in there as
[19:44] the introducer
[19:46] to take christ and you john being the
[19:49] top of the bride take you and christ and
[19:53] bring the two together just like he took
[19:55] the olive the tree off of the oneness
[19:57] and took the tree off the trinity put
[19:59] them together
[20:01] and grew into a big tree well that's
[20:02] what he was doing he was taking
[20:04] revelations 10 7 is interjected showing
[20:07] that there had become a messenger to
[20:09] reveal christ to john
[20:12] and then john went and took the book out
[20:14] of the hand of the angel he didn't take
[20:15] the book out of
[20:17] brother brown's hand which took it from
[20:19] the angel
[20:20] now we know that you got to put the two
[20:22] together
[20:23] we would have never got it but
[20:25] john took the book from the angel
[20:28] so you brother brown can't give you a
[20:30] revelation right
[20:32] he can't brother brown cannot give you i
[20:34] can't give you a revelation brother dale
[20:35] can't give you a revelation
[20:37] he can try his best to
[20:39] get you in a channel to where god can
[20:41] give you a revelation
[20:44] of starring after food
[20:46] that's correct that's that's what he was
[20:48] doing he was storing up the food knowing
[20:51] that he would not have to be the one to
[20:53] eat it
[20:54] he was pouring out food
[20:56] for future generations which is here and
[20:58] we're not going to get to our test
[21:01] all right luke 21 17 and you shall be
[21:03] hated of all men for my name's sake
[21:06] there shall not a hair of your head
[21:07] perish
[21:09] in your patience
[21:11] possess you your souls
[21:13] romans 5
[21:14] 1 therefore being justified by faith we
[21:17] have peace with god through our lord
[21:19] jesus christ by whom also we have access
[21:22] by faith
[21:24] so their faith at the bottom of the
[21:25] pyramid exact as accessed
[21:28] into this grace wherein we stand and
[21:29] rejoice in hope of the glory of god
[21:32] and not only so but we glory in
[21:34] tribulation also
[21:36] knowing the tribulation work of
[21:39] patience
[21:40] and patience experience and in spirit
[21:43] experience
[21:44] hope hebrews 6 and we desire that every
[21:46] one of you to show the same diligence
[21:49] to the full assurance of hope under what
[21:51] unto the end so there we go we talk
[21:53] enduring
[21:54] but you be not slow for
[21:56] the followers of them who through faith
[21:58] and patience inherit the promise through
[22:00] faith and patience
[22:01] inherit the promise but when god made
[22:03] promise to abraham
[22:05] because he could swear by no greater he
[22:07] swore swear by himself saying surely
[22:09] blessing i will bless thee and multiply
[22:11] we'll multiply them and so after
[22:14] he had patiently endured
[22:16] god didn't just give him the baby right
[22:17] off
[22:19] he patiently endured for 25 years
[22:23] of of troubles and moving around and
[22:26] and i'm sure heart aches because he was
[22:28] a uh he was a man he wasn't anything
[22:31] real special he just believed god
[22:34] hebrews wherefore seeing we also are
[22:36] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[22:38] witness us lay aside every weight
[22:40] and sin which does so easily beset us
[22:42] and let us run with patience the race
[22:44] that is set before us
[22:46] james one my brother encountered all joy
[22:48] when you fall into many temptations
[22:50] county joy

[23:24] that the trying of your faith work is
[23:26] patience but let patience have a perfect
[23:28] work that you may be perfect and entire

[25:04] time
[25:04] he wants us to grow up
[25:07] but when we come down to these things
[25:08] here god can't build us into that
[25:10] stature say he can't
[25:13] he can't
[25:14] no he can't you gotta let him
[25:17] right you gotta let him
[25:19] god's not gonna give you anything that
[25:21] you don't want
[25:24] he can't make us up to that kind of a
[25:26] place
[25:28] he said well that's contrary it's got to
[25:29] be god yeah it's god doing it
[25:32] but you got to allow it

[25:58] patience
[25:59] say well i asked him last night to heal
[26:01] me i'm just a sick this morning oh my

[26:11] patient with god
[26:12] but he will always before you let him be
[26:14] the next crossing thing you can't cross
[26:16] him so just keep him before you he said
[26:19] so it's going to happen see keep him
[26:20] before you that's right
