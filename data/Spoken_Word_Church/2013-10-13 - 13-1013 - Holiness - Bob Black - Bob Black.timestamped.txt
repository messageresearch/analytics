[0:09] thank you
[0:12] now this morning I would like to read
[0:15] from
[0:16] Hebrews chapter 12
[0:19] verse 14.
[0:30] thank you
[0:34] before we get started let's just go to
[0:37] the Lord in prayer real quick well we
[0:39] thank you for the day Lord continue to
[0:41] serve you Lord Jesus that you've given
[0:43] us and thank you Lord Jesus for the
[0:45] opportunity to read your word and find
[0:47] ourselves and see more about you and
[0:49] your word Lord and I pray that you'll
[0:50] open that to us this morning God be with
[0:52] us in the service today Lord and
[0:54] remember by the way in such a junior
[0:56] orders and ministries of your Scots
[0:59] will be with us this morning I pray in
[1:01] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04] Hebrews
[1:06] chapter 12.
[1:13] power piece
[1:16] with all men and holiness
[1:19] without which no man
[1:21] shall see the Lord
[1:24] I wanted to talk about the topic of
[1:27] Holiness this morning
[1:29] because it's been a subject that I I
[1:32] just been meditating on a lot lately
[1:35] and you know by the way he's been
[1:36] covering the uh after you received a new
[1:38] birth and then you move up to the Statue
[1:40] of perfect man as these attributes that
[1:42] are part of God or begin to be made
[1:44] manifest in you from Faith to Virtue and
[1:47] knowledge and all up
[1:49] but I I this morning I just want to take
[1:51] a step back and look at before these
[1:54] attributes can even be made manifest
[1:56] holy what what has to take place first
[2:00] and I think sometimes uh not so much in
[2:03] teaching because I know this has been
[2:04] taught over and over in this church and
[2:06] we all should be well versed in these
[2:09] topics but maybe sometimes in our own
[2:11] mind we begin to kind of gloss over the
[2:13] importance of sanctification and
[2:15] Holiness in our life
[2:17] and
[2:19] Holiness isn't just something that uh is
[2:22] just a phase in your life where first
[2:24] you're Justified and then then you
[2:26] become holy Holiness begins to be born
[2:29] in you and then through your the new
[2:31] birth uh is completed and you begin to
[2:34] move on up in the statue for perfect man
[2:35] but Holiness is something that it in in
[2:38] Luke 175 uh Luke Jesus told us that you
[2:42] should live all of your days in Holiness
[2:45] and righteousness that your whole life
[2:47] should be just rawd in a holy living and
[2:51] living a Pure Clean life for God and
[2:54] before these virtues can be can be
[2:56] brought forth before God can step into
[3:00] you his person then first you've got to
[3:03] live a holy you've got to become holy
[3:06] and I want to just take a look at how
[3:08] that happens and why that's so important
[3:10] this morning you know when you uh a lot
[3:13] of times just listening to conversations
[3:15] of people over the years A lot of times
[3:18] the metric that people use to gauge
[3:20] whether someone's really a Christian or
[3:22] not or whether a church is really a
[3:24] Christian Church where they want to make
[3:25] their home is because they come into the
[3:27] church and they look around and see the
[3:29] Holiness of the people to see whether
[3:31] they really desire
[3:33] to see
[3:36] more of God to see whether they whether
[3:39] they're approaching it in the right way
[3:41] to see what their approach is you know
[3:43] the approach is so important the the way
[3:46] that you come to God the way your
[3:47] motives and objectives and
[3:50] and uh you know just to listen to
[3:53] people's conversations over the years I
[3:55] I remember uh one sister that years ago
[3:58] talking about another church that you
[4:00] know they they didn't want to go to that
[4:02] church because the pastor years ago
[4:04] hadn't married somebody of a mixed race
[4:06] or whatever and this this little things
[4:07] like that that they used to people
[4:09] people gazed to see how concerned you
[4:12] are for the word for the keeping of the
[4:14] word and that's how you gauge a minister
[4:16] to what why would you want to minister
[4:18] to stand before you that doesn't that
[4:21] doesn't regard the scripture with with
[4:24] all that wants to keep themselves that
[4:26] wants to keep themselves pure and holy
[4:28] and live a holy life for the people how
[4:30] could you uh accept something from
[4:32] somebody that's not living a Pure Life
[4:34] and try to teach teach you how to live a
[4:38] way that's pleasing to God if they're
[4:39] not holy so you know James taught us
[4:42] that the the metric that men look at one
[4:44] another is by works to see what you're
[4:47] doing and how you're how you're
[4:48] approaching God and of course the way
[4:51] God looks is Faith he wants to see your
[4:53] faith and a lot of times we can't see
[4:55] Faith but we can see whether we regard
[4:58] God's word whether we regard God's
[5:01] Sanctuary that the the the church
[5:04] whether we keep it in reverence when we
[5:07] come into the sanctuary if we're just
[5:09] going about uh shaking hands in the
[5:11] middle of the sanctuary and uh and doing
[5:14] things that are not becoming to keep it
[5:16] holy and and uh and and how we regard
[5:19] our own vessel
[5:21] and you know what Malachi chapter 3
[5:23] verse one it talks about how that John
[5:25] the Baptist well it prophesies of John
[5:28] the Baptist coming uh you know Malachi
[5:30] doesn't say John the Baptist but it
[5:32] talks about that God would send his
[5:34] messenger before his face to prepare the
[5:36] way because
[5:38] the one that you seek and I'm
[5:40] paraphrasing a little bit the one that
[5:42] they had been looking for for 4 000
[5:44] years will quickly come to his Temple so
[5:48] now John the Baptist had to come to
[5:50] prepare to make the way straight to get
[5:53] the people's mind ready to receive the
[5:56] word that was going to come to the
[5:59] temple quickly maybe unexpectedly
[6:01] and and uh you know they sat on the
[6:04] banks of the river and and John spoke
[6:06] and and turned began to turn their
[6:08] hearts and they they began to realize
[6:10] that something was happening something
[6:11] great was happening
[6:13] and and then all of a sudden uh Jesus
[6:17] came on the scene the word that he had
[6:19] been looking for for so many thousands
[6:21] of years and he walked into the temple
[6:25] and they should have had the temple
[6:28] purified and clean and everything just
[6:31] uh moving in perfect order with God's
[6:33] word just uh you know go back to the
[6:36] scriptures and see what uh
[6:39] you know what can I do to live a better
[6:42] life and how can I how should we do the
[6:45] order of this of the church service and
[6:47] how should we do the um you know is
[6:50] there anything that we're doing that's
[6:51] not right but instead they had the place
[6:55] filled with merches that were they were
[6:57] they had their eyes on the things of
[6:59] this world and they were selling uh
[7:01] selling dude money changers in the
[7:04] temple and when God came the word came
[7:07] to the temple now let's take it take a
[7:09] step back we we all should we were all
[7:11] been taught the type of the temple the
[7:13] type of the temple is is the Christian
[7:15] experience of is your you are the
[7:17] Tabernacle of the Lord
[7:19] and that the Christian experience is to
[7:22] go through the outer Court to the inner
[7:24] Court to the holy of holies we know all
[7:26] the types about how when you get into
[7:27] the inner core there's still clouds that
[7:29] cover over the Sun but when you move
[7:30] into the holy of holies then the the
[7:32] candlesticks and the the there's the
[7:34] pillar of fire back there that that
[7:36] shines light all the time even when
[7:38] you're at bad times or good times it
[7:40] doesn't matter now the Lord the word
[7:43] came to the tip to the temple
[7:45] and the temple was not holy it wasn't
[7:48] kept in a holy place and so he did the
[7:52] only thing
[7:53] it just something rose up in him and
[7:56] said this is not right because God has a
[7:58] plan and a purpose that is repeated All
[8:00] Through the Bible that the word will not
[8:03] come to an unclean vessel it's God to be
[8:07] holy it's got to be that you can't break
[8:10] that all through the scriptures that God
[8:12] will not bring his word and if you
[8:14] expect God to give you a revelation to
[8:16] open his word to you and you're not
[8:18] living in Holiness and keeping your life
[8:20] Sanctified and clean and have a desire
[8:22] to live more for God every day then uh
[8:25] it breaks the scripture for God's word
[8:28] to come to you and reveal himself to you
[8:30] and Step Into Your Vessel and so uh
[8:33] Jesus did
[8:36] really the only thing you know it
[8:39] baffles a lot of people when they read
[8:41] this how oh the loving God how can he
[8:43] get up a whip and and beat the money
[8:45] changes out but he did it because he
[8:48] desired Holiness because he was coming
[8:51] to the temple and he took up the Whip
[8:52] and drove the money changers out because
[8:54] he wants he wants us to be holy he won't
[8:58] get his Tabernacle to be holy that was
[9:00] just a type of our Tabernacle of us he
[9:03] wants to come and live in us but he
[9:05] can't do that unless we live unless we
[9:08] live in Holiness and I'm not talking
[9:10] about legalism
[9:12] not not legalism now because legalism is
[9:15] getting a book of rules and that's what
[9:17] the the in the Old Testament Israelites
[9:19] when Moses came down on the Ten
[9:20] Commandments he uh
[9:23] they they looked at those those Ten
[9:25] Commandments as as rules to follow
[9:27] instead of the attributes being made
[9:30] manifested attribute that same word that
[9:33] need to be made manifest in the people
[9:35] and and uh it's it's not legalism
[9:39] and uh you know all down through
[9:42] scripture people are are looking for the
[9:45] the true evidence of the Holy Ghost you
[9:46] can see this uh the um
[9:49] this great Planet how God moved through
[9:52] John Wesley that
[9:54] um you know John Wesley thought that if
[9:56] you shouted you got the Holy Ghost and
[9:58] and they you know they were looking for
[10:00] this promise and uh then it moved along
[10:03] a little bit further and they uh in
[10:05] Pentecost they thought the evidence was
[10:06] tongues and uh and it's so we look at
[10:10] Holiness and sanctification down through
[10:13] history Holiness has been looked at as
[10:16] the evidence of the new birth because
[10:17] it's it's confusing to our to our mental
[10:20] to our mental conception how you can
[10:22] live a holy life how can you live you
[10:25] can live where um you know the apostles
[10:28] were casting out spirits and they had
[10:31] power to cast out spirits and to live a
[10:34] holy life without in John 17 he says
[10:37] sanctify them by my by father and by my
[10:41] by by truth Thy word is truth so they
[10:44] were Sanctified potentially and uh
[10:48] but not they didn't they hadn't come to
[10:51] Pentecost yet and it it's uh
[10:54] you know what it's
[10:57] you've got to uh sanctification is not
[11:01] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and um
[11:04] you know I've been um
[11:06] I just been thinking about uh
[11:09] how you know when you're ministering you
[11:12] kind of tug people in One Direction or
[11:14] the other and I I've been thinking about
[11:17] how you know
[11:19] one one good example of that is when
[11:21] people preach on the fivefold ministry
[11:23] where you can go so far One Direction
[11:25] where you don't have a personal
[11:26] relationship with the Holy Ghost that
[11:28] you rely on so much on the ministry and
[11:31] then you can go the other direction and
[11:32] where you're not you're not you're not
[11:34] seeking help for the ministry you like
[11:36] live in isolationism where you're you're
[11:38] sitting at home and you're listening to
[11:40] taste in your life you're not going to
[11:41] church and so there's a the middle of
[11:43] the road to everything and I just want
[11:46] to clarify something now uh when I uh
[11:49] you might say well brother Bob uh you
[11:51] know you talk about love and and such
[11:54] and so forth but now brother Bob do you
[11:57] believe
[11:57] like how Jesus did
[11:59] that he will he wanted to sanctify his
[12:03] Temple well Bob do you believe that your
[12:05] home should be Sanctified do you believe
[12:07] your children should be in obedience do
[12:09] you believe in that there's a middle of
[12:11] the road see you can't you can't be a
[12:13] Hitler and say you're gonna you're gonna
[12:15] be a Christian but on the other hand I
[12:19] can't let my daughters wear pants and
[12:21] such life I can't let my children run
[12:23] around with long hair and and that kind
[12:25] of thing I want my home to be Sanctified
[12:27] because I want the spirit of the Lord to
[12:29] be made to feel welcome I can't let my
[12:32] children go up to the to their uh
[12:34] upstairs room and shut the door and get
[12:36] on the internet and let all kind of foul
[12:38] things come in I need to be aware of
[12:40] what's going on in my home because you
[12:43] know brother Brown preached the sermon
[12:44] doors and a door in your heart you have
[12:47] doors that if you shut you won't you
[12:49] want every door of your heart to be made
[12:51] open to the Holy Spirit you can come in
[12:53] and have total preemness and maybe we
[12:55] could apply that to our homes you know
[12:57] when when uh maybe search out your home
[12:59] and make sure that everything is
[13:01] perfectly and older so they're not just
[13:03] in your heart that the Holy Spirit can
[13:04] come in but in your home that the Holy
[13:06] Spirit can come in the house and be
[13:08] welcome in your home and you know a lot
[13:11] of times when I pray I
[13:14] I get on my knees at night and
[13:18] I put my hands on the wall and say God's
[13:21] sanctified
[13:23] sanctify every wall in this home
[13:28] because I don't want him to just I don't
[13:31] want to want to be one corner of my own
[13:33] one place that he's not welcome
[13:42] y'all forgive me
[13:48] and I believe in holiness
[13:50] but I don't believe in there's a a
[13:53] middle of the road to everything you you
[13:56] know our children Jesus told in Matthew
[13:59] about how uh despise not these little
[14:02] children
[14:03] because your little children there's an
[14:06] approach to that if you try to get your
[14:08] children to live a holy life and you
[14:10] yourself are not living only life then
[14:12] it'll wound them in their in their
[14:14] Spirit uh I remember that this is a
[14:16] table quote now about or I was looking
[14:19] for it I couldn't find I remember really
[14:20] Paul's testimony how he uh brother Brown
[14:24] told him don't spank your children and
[14:25] anger because it will wound it will it
[14:28] will wound their little angel and they
[14:30] uh
[14:31] in Matthew said uh
[14:34] their their angels are always beholding
[14:36] the father's face because you know until
[14:38] they come to a certain age they have a
[14:39] community insane if they were to die
[14:41] right then they'd go right into the
[14:42] presence of the Lord that their
[14:43] theophany and what about what about
[14:45] adults you know we we also are are wound
[14:49] enough if I was to call you you stupid
[14:51] for not having a revelation you know
[14:53] that would that would lose you in your
[14:54] spirit and you know then uh then I
[14:57] wouldn't be able to help you anymore
[14:58] because you kind of have that to
[15:00] overcome so there's there's a uh and you
[15:03] know I I actually that last sermon I
[15:05] preached is how do you get your children
[15:09] to uh to how do you how do you approach
[15:12] holding this in your home and encourage
[15:14] your children to live a holy lives and
[15:16] the answer is to catch a vision if you
[15:19] can get them to see their plan and
[15:21] purpose in life they're uh
[15:24] I was talking to somebody recently and
[15:27] um I'm sorry I'm kind of bouncing around
[15:29] a little bit because I just got a
[15:30] million thoughts at once but I I was
[15:33] talking to somebody recently and they
[15:34] said
[15:36] I'm I I can't teach my children because
[15:39] I'm not a minister
[15:41] now
[15:43] I I have to I have to say something
[15:46] about that now because you know even the
[15:48] even the the weakest if you've got the
[15:50] Holy Ghost the the weakest Christian is
[15:53] greater than John the Baptist so you've
[15:55] got surely you have something that you
[15:57] can teach surely you can you can uh uh
[16:00] just you know when we were my kids were
[16:02] little they uh I used to put pillows
[16:06] down and I I'd say you step on this
[16:08] pillow and that's justification and then
[16:11] I put two pillars down now what's the
[16:13] next step sanctification I make them
[16:15] tell me what it was you step on that
[16:17] first pillow sight justification what is
[16:19] that I believe that yeah
[16:22] and you step on that next pillow what is
[16:25] sanctification and I own up and you know
[16:27] maybe they didn't really have a true
[16:28] understanding but but you can teach them
[16:30] something
[16:31] teach them a little bit and maybe uh
[16:34] sometimes in church things things begin
[16:36] to get a little bit deep and you take
[16:38] them home and and and backtrack a little
[16:40] bit teach them a little simple things
[16:42] like like that God has that you have
[16:45] value to God and you know that's a
[16:46] that's a real simple thing that you can
[16:49] teach your children that and the devil
[16:50] will try to teach young people they
[16:52] don't have any value that God doesn't
[16:54] care anything about them teach the
[16:55] little children you know I'm talking on
[16:57] the recorder and two maybe not a lot of
[16:59] y'all already have kids growing up and
[17:01] everything but
[17:03] but the little I I'm I just stressing
[17:07] this morning Holiness because it's uh
[17:10] without holiness
[17:13] then how can the word come to the temple
[17:15] without Holiness right so I I wrote down
[17:20] just a few things
[17:22] about what what brother Brown said about
[17:24] Holiness a few words
[17:27] and one word
[17:29] that he wrote was separate
[17:31] because
[17:33] a real holy person will be you can look
[17:36] upon them and they have separated
[17:38] themselves from the things of the world
[17:40] like Abraham a lot you know God will if
[17:44] you give God the preeminist he'll begin
[17:46] to separate you if you give it over to
[17:48] him he'll separate you from the things
[17:51] of the world and you know the first
[17:52] thing when you when a new desire comes
[17:54] into your life a lot of the sisters is
[17:57] maybe more apparent but
[17:58] um you know you telling the sisters
[18:00] because they were they'll change their
[18:02] dress well what about the brothers
[18:04] the brothers you know a real man has
[18:08] baggy knees you can't change if I'm
[18:11] thinking on that a real man is not
[18:13] somebody that lifts weights and stuff
[18:15] but a real man is somebody you know we
[18:17] talk about at Valentine's Day how to
[18:19] impress your wife well I have never
[18:21] angered my wife when I said I'm going to
[18:23] my prayer quality my life has never got
[18:26] upset when I said I'm I'm going away to
[18:28] pray a little bit
[18:29] a praying man that wants to have his
[18:32] house holy and set in order that'll
[18:35] that'll please you watch we're at all
[18:36] too a real Holy Ghost filled woman that
[18:38] should be pleasing to her to have her
[18:40] man desire uh to to for his children to
[18:43] hear somebody crying out for God to save
[18:46] my children and save my family help my
[18:48] wife to be a better mother help help me
[18:51] to be a better parent and you know uh
[18:55] you know I when I first became a parent
[18:57] I I used to tell the Lord
[19:00] like I feel like Solomon I don't know
[19:03] how to go out or how to come in I don't
[19:06] know which way to go but he knows all
[19:08] things and if you ask the Lord how to
[19:10] raise your children how to do God will
[19:13] guide you in everything which job to get
[19:16] which church to go to how to raise your
[19:18] children which color to buy if you let
[19:21] him do the answering and seek his will
[19:23] now the next thing the next word that
[19:27] brother Brown talked about was an order
[19:29] because God puts your life in order
[19:32] everything when you when you are
[19:34] Sanctified in the holy God orders your
[19:37] life and and uh you know he he preached
[19:40] a series of sermons about conduct order
[19:42] and Doctrine because the Tabernacle of
[19:44] the Lord or the the church that you go
[19:46] to has an order and everything has to be
[19:49] set in order to be pleasing to God you
[19:51] don't come into church and uh you know
[19:53] eating stuff in the back of the church
[19:55] and and uh just shaking hands hithering
[19:59] young and and uh like many other
[20:02] churches today that don't have this
[20:04] Revelation that we do that because we
[20:06] know we know how to act we know how to
[20:08] behave and we should and uh you know you
[20:12] don't uh you
[20:14] you don't come in just laughing and then
[20:16] making a mockery of it because of
[20:19] we have we know what the order and the
[20:22] approach should be
[20:24] and another thing that Holiness is a
[20:27] Sanctified life does is it makes you
[20:29] free because Holiness that part in your
[20:32] journey of sanctification is when the
[20:34] unclean Spirit goes out
[20:36] when the unclean Spirit goes out you
[20:39] should be free you should be free and
[20:42] and happy and joyful we should be the
[20:45] happiest people in the world because God
[20:48] has made us holy and sanctified
[20:51] cleansed
[20:53] and washed
[20:54] your name goes on the book when you're
[20:57] sanctified
[20:59] power over unclean spirits
[21:02] now that unclean Spirit goes out now you
[21:05] have power to cast out those clean
[21:07] Spirits they began to minister when they
[21:09] uh got to that stage in the journey the
[21:11] apostles but now brother Brown said he
[21:13] clarified things now you a minister has
[21:16] no right
[21:17] to to open the word tear open that order
[21:21] like the eagle you know open up that
[21:23] word if he has doesn't have a personal
[21:25] experience with the with the pillar fire
[21:29] just like Moses did I'm just clarifying
[21:31] because you know
[21:34] and uh I was reading in um this sermon
[21:38] that brother round spoke about in 1963 I
[21:42] forget the title it was in September
[21:44] but it was just before the seals were
[21:47] open
[21:48] and um
[21:50] I don't know he's got a few more minutes
[21:51] but
[21:54] he he prayed his prayer
[21:57] that he said uh Lord I pray that uh and
[22:01] I'm paraphrasing I just have a few
[22:03] little things to scribble down that
[22:05] every Spirit of doubting
[22:07] every spirit of fear
[22:10] denominational claim
[22:13] every habit
[22:15] every sickness every disease that's
[22:18] among the people
[22:20] that they would be delivering because
[22:22] and he went on to say the Seven Seals
[22:26] are going to be a reveal are going to be
[22:29] open now the word that the seventh seals
[22:32] you know all down through brother
[22:34] Brown's Ministry
[22:36] he was Preparing People through through
[22:39] the first pull in the second pool to
[22:41] receive the opening of the word his
[22:44] message didn't really start until 1963
[22:46] you say I believe the message but I
[22:49] don't know what he preached after 1963
[22:51] you haven't even heard the message if
[22:53] you haven't listened to the tapes and
[22:55] and understand I have just a basic
[22:57] understanding of what he uh preached
[22:59] after 1963 don't really understand the
[23:01] message because the message is before
[23:03] 1963 were just preparing away getting
[23:07] our hearts in mind uh the second pool to
[23:09] to uh you know call us to a clean life
[23:12] where you stand in the prayer line and
[23:14] he calls out by discernment what you've
[23:17] done in your past what what uh things
[23:19] are hindering you to to get things holy
[23:21] and right and I believe that's what he
[23:23] was calling for in this sermon I
[23:25] apologize I can't remember the title but
[23:27] that every Spirit let's just go through
[23:29] these just one kind of think about one
[23:31] step at a time every Spirit of the doubt
[23:34] now think of this in the context of the
[23:36] seals are about to be open and he's
[23:39] trying to clear the way get all of that
[23:42] out of the way
[23:43] every Spirit of dialing maybe doubting
[23:46] that he's not a real Prophet that he
[23:48] doesn't have the word for the age every
[23:51] spirit of fear you know that's a big one
[23:53] that people are afraid afraid that uh
[23:56] you know though something bad will
[23:57] happen on the way to church afraid that
[23:59] they'll they'll lose their job afraid
[24:01] that um you know I I I'm I've been
[24:05] acquainted with people that just every
[24:07] time they turn around that they're just
[24:08] afraid of everything but you know
[24:11] perfect love casts without fear and we
[24:15] don't we should not don't be content to
[24:18] live in fear and that's what he's trying
[24:20] to get to the people what about
[24:21] denominational clean clinging to your
[24:24] old old ideas of the old uh old
[24:27] doctrines and things that little little
[24:29] uh denominationalisms like Lot's wife
[24:32] where she turned around and turned into
[24:33] a pillar of salt don't turn around and
[24:36] look back every habit now you know there
[24:40] are good atoms if you get up in the
[24:42] morning and pray everyone that's a good
[24:44] habit if you read your Bible every day
[24:46] that's a good habit but now you don't
[24:48] want to get in the happy world
[24:49] this might hurt some feelings I gotta
[24:52] have my coffee I can't function I got it
[24:55] when you start relying on things you
[24:58] start getting into the getting into
[25:00] things where uh
[25:03] you know those are bad happens get the
[25:05] uh and you know we could go on along
[25:07] about that how about every sickness
[25:10] every disease that's among the people
[25:12] every disease that's another thing that
[25:15] hangs people get hung up in their mind
[25:16] that God wants me to be sick
[25:19] so they can glorify himself now let it
[25:22] be glorified in my healing not in my
[25:25] sickness because everyone in the New
[25:27] Testament in the New Testament is
[25:29] written to everyone that came to Jesus
[25:31] was healed there's not one recorded case
[25:33] of anyone that came to Jesus and wasn't
[25:35] healed I'm not I'm not I'm not preaching
[25:36] that you know if you've got to say in
[25:38] your life and that kind of thing you're
[25:39] going to be healed we all know the the
[25:41] prescription for healing is uh God God
[25:44] heals Christians first you give your
[25:46] life to him and promise to serve him and
[25:48] then he'll heal him
[25:50] okay
[25:52] but uh not not I'm just kind of wrapping
[25:56] up in your eyes
[26:00] trying to find a good place but now
[26:02] sanctification is not legalism outward
[26:05] formalism observance or rituals
[26:08] pronunciation of duties
[26:10] or being able here's a good one
[26:14] being able a sanctification you sit in
[26:17] the church and uh
[26:20] and you could you you hear somebody say
[26:23] uh the word and uh you maybe you take
[26:26] notes and you can write back exactly
[26:30] what the minister said
[26:31] exactly what they said and you begin to
[26:34] build up in your mind that uh because I
[26:37] can repeat back that I have an
[26:39] understanding but remember brother was
[26:41] preaching that until the Seven Seals
[26:43] open you you're just presuming you're
[26:45] just saying you're just saying that's
[26:47] what somebody else says now now maybe in
[26:50] a sanctification you kind of get wrapped
[26:52] up in in uh in the uh
[26:59] I'll kind of finish on this but now just
[27:02] because you can repeat back and you can
[27:05] say I believe that there is a
[27:07] sanctification justification
[27:08] sanctification Bachelor Holy Ghost and
[27:11] I'm not trying to offend anybody or
[27:13] anything I just feel I feel so strongly
[27:16] about holy living but just because you
[27:19] can quote back and read quotes and and
[27:22] say uh
[27:24] say exactly what brother Dale said right
[27:26] just repeat back exactly what he said
[27:29] until it's you know you can you can
[27:32] repeat the scripture where it says
[27:34] unless you're born in the spirit you
[27:35] can't say that Jesus is the Christ and I
[27:38] can repeat that all day long one day I'm
[27:41] not presuming anymore because it's
[27:43] become a living reality to me and the
[27:46] scriptures that I've heard over and over
[27:47] through the years they become living
[27:50] living inside and be become manifested
[27:53] and that's what by the way he's talking
[27:54] about where they become these attributes
[27:57] become made manifest in faith virtue
[28:00] knowledge where you know that he's the
[28:03] same yesterday today and forever
[28:18] it was in February 1963. I can't
[28:21] remember the time
[28:23] February 15th 1963 that's weird that I
[28:27] can remember the date but not the time
[28:30] all right we'll finish there
[28:32] thank you
