[0:09] me today huh
[0:10] what do you mean yeah
[0:15] now I want to thank brother Aaron for
[0:18] taking care of my brother Richard and
[0:20] they kind of stayed up a little partying
[0:21] last night with that moth so uh
[0:24] so they're uh they're recuperating today
[0:26] so brother Aaron I told him I would do a
[0:29] Sunday school class so if you turn the
[0:31] book of Galatians we just want to start
[0:33] there being today is the 52nd
[0:37] anniversary uh we had
[0:41] looked into you know doing something
[0:44] about the Jubilee but the Jubilee years
[0:46] of 50th so we're actually into the end
[0:49] of the we're in we're out we should
[0:50] already be free and now that we are
[0:53] coming into Independence Day which will
[0:55] be on Tuesday our founding fathers
[0:58] wanted to get away from tyranny and and
[1:02] oppression
[1:03] and wanted to have freedom
[1:06] so they came over here and July the 4th
[1:10] 1776 we became a nation here or uh we
[1:15] are celebrating our independence so
[1:17] let's talk about freedom because freedom
[1:19] in God now listen You'll never be free
[1:22] in man
[1:24] there's always going to be a boss
[1:26] there's always going to be this there's
[1:28] always going to be that so there's there
[1:30] we just need to see that there's freedom
[1:32] in the Lord Jesus all right don't worry
[1:35] about that other Freedom it's all right
[1:37] we got to have bosses we got to be
[1:38] bosses
[1:39] we got to have
[1:41] um people that tell us what to do and
[1:43] you got to have a preacher to stand up
[1:44] here and and you know tell you good and
[1:47] tell you you're bad all right amen all
[1:49] right Billy Richard that's right amen
[1:51] that's our job all right but you can be
[1:54] free in the Lord or you can be sitting
[1:57] here today and be bound now I'm not
[1:58] going to try to preach I'm going to try
[1:59] to teach so I got 30 minutes maybe
[2:02] longer I can take whatever time no I'm
[2:04] just kidding Galatians 4 verse 29 let's
[2:06] read that but as many of them now this
[2:09] is Paul talking to the Galatians let's
[2:11] talk about being free
[2:13] having freedom and liberty
[2:16] but as then he that was born after the
[2:18] flesh persecuted him that was born after
[2:21] the spirit
[2:22] even so it is now
[2:24] all right he's talking about
[2:27] Jacob and Esau amen all right he's also
[2:30] talking about the different the the
[2:32] contrast and and you know the the Bond
[2:35] woman you also this will read here now
[2:37] in verse 30 is talking about
[2:41] um Sarah
[2:42] and Hagar
[2:45] all right now God promised Abraham a
[2:48] child
[2:50] all right
[2:51] but he didn't promise him a child
[2:54] from the Bond woman
[2:57] now remember Hagar was in the house and
[2:59] she was you know she was there and and
[3:02] um Sarah said ah look I can't bear the
[3:05] child's here you need to fulfill that's
[3:07] why women should not be preaching just
[3:09] want to bring that to uh to your point
[3:11] that they just shouldn't be doing that
[3:14] um and there's a reason behind it not
[3:16] just because we don't we should be the
[3:17] men and we stand up here no there's a
[3:20] reason behind it because they get into
[3:22] emotion and and Sarah bless her heart
[3:25] she was emotional she wanted to have a
[3:26] base she wanted to produce what God Said
[3:28] isn't that what brother Brown said that
[3:30] the eve wanted
[3:32] he wanted to help God and he said okay
[3:35] she says okay you know what let me let
[3:37] me let me handle the plan will you see
[3:39] what happened
[3:40] so what happened in this year this Union
[3:42] between Abraham though and Hagar It
[3:45] produced a Bond woman and a bond child
[3:49] right now we don't want to be bound
[3:50] today right we want to be free so we
[3:53] don't want to be in the bound part we
[3:55] want to be in the free part all right
[3:57] now nevertheless what saith the
[3:59] scripture cast out the blind woman and
[4:01] her son remember
[4:02] God told them cast them out but now
[4:04] remember he didn't forget them
[4:06] he didn't forget it he said you Ishmael
[4:08] you'll be a wild child in other words
[4:10] though I'll bless you I'm gonna give you
[4:12] land I'm gonna give you all these things
[4:14] but you're always going to be the bond
[4:17] child
[4:18] and so when you're born into this world
[4:21] by your natural birth you are a bond
[4:24] child
[4:25] you are bound you are bound by this
[4:27] thing but we want to be heirs as it says
[4:31] here shall not be the son of the Bond
[4:33] woman shall not be Heir with the son of
[4:36] the free woman all right so the free
[4:38] woman was Sarah who it was supposed to
[4:41] happen to to begin with and when they
[4:44] produce a child they produced Isaac all
[4:46] right so when you're born again you move
[4:48] from that Bond woman child
[4:50] you're now a free woman you you're born
[4:52] from a free woman all right so then
[4:54] brethren we are not children of the Bond
[4:56] woman but of the free all right so
[4:59] Paul's telling us we're going to be
[5:01] buying
[5:03] over here but we're going to be free
[5:05] over here all right so there's two
[5:08] things right like like I was preaching
[5:10] the other day you know Paul says the
[5:12] life I now live that means he lived a
[5:15] different life but the life I now live
[5:18] I live by the faith of the Son of God he
[5:20] didn't before
[5:21] he went by his own word
[5:25] he interpreted the Old Testament his own
[5:28] way Paul did Saul dead but when God
[5:32] struck him down he became part of the
[5:34] free woman and he's and he's preaching
[5:36] right here and he's telling you I once
[5:38] was bound but now I'm free all right so
[5:41] then brethren we are not children of the
[5:43] modern woman but the freedom no don't
[5:45] let me start preaching Brother Richard
[5:46] don't be doing that
[5:47] Stand Fast look Stand Fast into what
[5:51] Liberty
[5:53] we love the Liberty Bell the Statue of
[5:55] Liberty and Liberty what about Liberty
[5:58] and God
[5:59] but now remember
[6:02] there's one problem with this
[6:04] Satan combines you
[6:07] and make you think you're free
[6:10] read Revelations 3 14 blind wretched
[6:13] miserable naked and don't know it all
[6:17] right that's the blindness of the Bond
[6:19] woman that's the the bind The Binding of
[6:23] the one over here
[6:24] but we want to be part of the free we
[6:27] want to what have our eyes open not our
[6:30] natural lives our spiritualized Stand
[6:33] Fast therefore in the what Liberty
[6:35] wherewith Christ has made us free and be
[6:38] not entangled I like that I don't like
[6:40] that word but that's a good word to use
[6:43] you remember Satan will always trip you
[6:46] up he will always entangle you in in the
[6:50] things of the world he'll always keep
[6:53] you busy
[6:55] he will always keep you busy
[6:59] we have more time now we should we got
[7:01] quick this quick that quick this quick
[7:03] deck
[7:05] and we don't have time for God
[7:08] well that's our yoka bondage be not
[7:10] entangled again with the Yoke of bondage
[7:12] our problem is
[7:14] us
[7:16] because we still live in this bondwoman
[7:19] Tabernacle right of flesh but inside
[7:23] that free woman we want the we want the
[7:26] son of the free woman to be let out
[7:27] right all right that's why I want to see
[7:30] watch let's go to Romans 5.
[7:33] verse 12. now right here is going to
[7:35] totally explain
[7:37] your salvation amen totally explain from
[7:41] the beginning of time till today what
[7:44] God's plan and purpose is coming from a
[7:47] master builder called Paul amen
[7:51] so we take Paul as the master builder so
[7:53] he must know how to build a house all
[7:55] right so here he begins to build Romans
[7:57] 5 verse 12. wherefore as by one man's
[8:02] sin entered into the world all right
[8:05] who's that Adam
[8:06] by one man's sin
[8:09] not Eve
[8:11] listen Adam's the one that sold us out
[8:16] Adam now I know brother around many many
[8:18] times talks about you know the grave
[8:20] sites and all the things you know it's
[8:22] because of a of a woman well that's okay
[8:24] and that's true
[8:25] but Adam is the one that stepped forward
[8:28] and said I'll take her sin
[8:31] don't kill her I'll take her sin because
[8:34] she's part of me so that destroyed the
[8:37] whole human race Adam seed did nothing
[8:39] but destroy and we're all sitting here
[8:41] today part of Adam C amen all right sure
[8:45] you got the beast in there somewhere but
[8:47] I like to think that I at least got
[8:49] something right you know at the
[8:50] beginning so wherefore as by one man now
[8:53] watch one if one man made the sin one
[8:56] man
[8:57] all right
[8:59] and death by sin so death passed upon
[9:02] all men now look for all have sinned all
[9:04] right there's none good no not one God
[9:07] as our brother said God's not a
[9:09] respecter of persons right
[9:12] now the only way you've got anything
[9:14] that was as Brother Richard was talking
[9:16] the other night last night about before
[9:17] the foundation of the world is that God
[9:19] knew by foreknowledge that when you got
[9:21] here you'd want it right amen he laid it
[9:25] right there but you know what he laid it
[9:26] out laid off Hitler one day
[9:28] he laid it out to John Dillinger one day
[9:31] he's John Dillinger is going to stand
[9:32] before God at the Judgment Day and he's
[9:35] going to say I don't he's going to say
[9:37] I'll tell you the day the hour and a
[9:39] minute I called you and you turned me
[9:40] down the difference in you and these
[9:43] brothers and sisters that are standing
[9:44] behind me as they accepted me and you
[9:46] didn't but now God can't change his mind
[9:48] then well if he already saw listen God
[9:51] already saw judgment
[9:52] that's exactly right he's finished with
[9:55] the day of judgment and his mind is done
[10:03] and we're here to act it out
[10:06] by choice
[10:09] we still have a choice Adam made a
[10:11] choice even God made a choice that's
[10:13] right right God said I want to save
[10:15] everybody but he's only going to save
[10:16] those that He Saw wanted to be saved all
[10:19] right so let's keep that straight I
[10:21] don't believe in predestination that God
[10:23] pulled you through a tube and made made
[10:24] you become a Christian
[10:26] true no like our brother said but God
[10:29] sought us because he saw us before the
[10:31] foundation of the world and he can't get
[10:33] us out of his mind you know we do things
[10:35] we go through life there's certain
[10:37] things you can't get out of your mind
[10:38] God can't get you out of his mind
[10:41] because he can't change his mind so he
[10:43] can't change that he can't get you out
[10:45] and like I've always said I'm gonna
[10:47] start preaching praise if God if God
[10:50] ever to you he cannot love you
[10:54] if he ever loved you and poured out his
[10:57] love on you he never can unlove you he
[11:00] can't say all you've done so bad we're
[11:02] at the end of your life and you've done
[11:04] so horrible I just I just made a mistake
[11:06] God don't make one mistake that's
[11:08] exactly right he started this thing with
[11:12] Redemption
[11:13] before the foundation of the world where
[11:16] were you as as Brother Richard talk
[11:18] about where were you
[11:21] come on in
[11:24] so death passed upon all men for that
[11:26] all have sinned For unto the law look
[11:29] sin was in the world
[11:31] but sin is not imputed when there is no
[11:34] law
[11:35] so there had to be a law that's a
[11:37] exactly even when Adam fell God had
[11:41] already a law in place he said I got to
[11:43] kill a lamb right amen
[11:45] amen God came down himself and killed a
[11:47] lamb threw the Skins back into in the
[11:50] bushes as the prophet said and said put
[11:52] these on Amen because blood is what's
[11:55] going to have to cover you listen
[11:57] brother Brown said one second in front
[11:59] of God with sin he'll destroy you so
[12:01] there had to be something made in the
[12:04] mind of God
[12:06] that he never saw Adam saying
[12:08] amen hallelujah with his physical eyes
[12:12] so there's a separation there but yet
[12:14] God never forgot Adam no no Adam's not
[12:16] going to be in hell
[12:18] Adam's are going to be in heaven he's
[12:20] going to be right there with us
[12:22] I'd like to talk to him about a few
[12:24] things
[12:26] but still remember
[12:29] we'll get together on that
[12:31] but still God so entrusted Adam till
[12:34] even today Adam's impact is being felt
[12:39] right bad and good because he named all
[12:41] the animals remember if he said elephant
[12:43] it's still an elephant a man six
[12:47] thousand years later Adam said that big
[12:49] old gray thing with the trunk on it that
[12:51] be an elephant right there and nobody
[12:53] said no and God didn't say no son I
[12:55] wasn't thinking that no he said boy
[12:57] that's exactly what I was thinking amen
[13:00] the last way he wants to be with us
[13:02] because Paul tells us to have the mind
[13:03] of Christ but when he tells us to have
[13:05] the mind of Christ
[13:07] then we need to mind the Christ because
[13:10] our carnal mind come on in brother and
[13:12] have a seat yes sir
[13:16] all right now listen nevertheless death
[13:19] Reign look from Adam to Moses
[13:22] now why do you say Adam to Moses
[13:25] because there was no law
[13:27] the law was not there
[13:29] man just pretty much did whatever they
[13:31] wanted to do but remember you had a
[13:34] righteous group though that came from
[13:36] Abel Seth all the way down that tried to
[13:39] keep it straight but then God said I got
[13:41] to give him a law because they gonna
[13:43] have to live by something they can't
[13:45] just do this running around in like same
[13:47] way today we can't do this slopping
[13:49] around and marrying whoever you want to
[13:50] and and um so anyway
[13:53] we got to keep it clean God wanted it
[13:55] clean so we're going to keep it clean
[13:57] all right that's why we there's certain
[13:59] things that as I was saying the other
[14:00] day about godliness we say well we can't
[14:03] be Godly well brother Brian said you can
[14:04] God said you can all right you say how
[14:07] can I be garlic live
[14:09] what he wrote pretty simple look what he
[14:14] wrote he told you women not to cut your
[14:16] hair you don't gut your hair he told you
[14:18] women not to wear pants you don't wear
[14:20] pants well he tells us not to divorce
[14:22] and marry and divorce and marry we don't
[14:24] do that all right so we're living more
[14:26] Godly than the world is living
[14:28] even the nominal Christian world
[14:30] sorry to say it's become just a
[14:33] smorgasbord of whatever you want to do
[14:35] out there
[14:36] Holiness and godliness has went out the
[14:40] door amen amen that's right wearing
[14:44] shorts to church I mean you know you say
[14:45] well you're just being legalistic you
[14:47] know when I was growing up
[14:51] coming to church was a sacred thing
[14:54] you put on your best you acted your best
[14:58] even the ones we knew were sinning and
[15:03] community now come on somebody they
[15:06] walked in that church they had on their
[15:08] Sunday best
[15:09] okay they made an effort
[15:12] God wants us to make an effort why don't
[15:13] we come to church make an effort
[15:16] we come here to worship God we can come
[15:18] here to see people we didn't come here
[15:19] to listen to me or brother Michael or
[15:21] anybody else you came here to hear from
[15:23] God now whether he picked this vessel or
[15:25] that vessel or the one coming all right
[15:27] or yours all right I got off I'm on a
[15:30] rabbit Trail I'm coming back here we're
[15:32] airing up Aaron I'm back all right sorry
[15:34] about that I'm supposed to be teaching
[15:36] Sunday School
[15:38] kind of hard to do nevertheless death
[15:41] rain from Madeline to Moses what even
[15:43] over them that had not sinned after the
[15:46] samlitude of Adam's transgression who is
[15:49] the figure of him now who's the one to
[15:50] come Christ Christ is the one to come
[15:54] listen Adam portrayed Christ to a degree
[15:56] but remember when Adam took even the
[15:59] garden and said God don't kill her she's
[16:01] part of me I I don't want you to kill
[16:03] her I I'm gonna I'm gonna take her and
[16:05] take her sin
[16:07] now God didn't get angry about that I
[16:10] don't know
[16:11] God did put a division or or he did he
[16:14] did put enmity between God and man we
[16:16] couldn't con we couldn't go go down into
[16:18] cool the evening and talk to Adam face
[16:20] to face talk to Eve face to face right
[16:22] but he did set a provision amen amen
[16:28] so Christ
[16:30] ever how bad we are as his bride come on
[16:35] he's not gonna let us die as Brother
[16:37] Richard said we win
[16:39] [Music]
[16:41] regardless of whatever Revelations 19
[16:43] said his wife
[16:45] had made herself ready I'm just reading
[16:48] you the Bible
[16:49] amen so but we do have some work to do
[16:51] because it said she made herself ready
[16:52] she didn't sit on her can and not anyway
[16:55] not do anything she got ready
[16:58] we're one day closer to the Rapture I'll
[17:00] believe that all right tomorrow we'll be
[17:02] one day closer in the next day but
[17:03] there's going to be a time when God's
[17:05] going to shut the door of the Ark so we
[17:07] need to get in all right
[17:09] but not as the offense what was the
[17:11] offense Adam's saying so also it's the
[17:13] free gift now here's we're talking about
[17:15] freedom and talking about July the 4th
[17:16] and and and proclaiming our freedom
[17:19] listen the United States of America I've
[17:22] been in several countries
[17:23] the United States of America as bad as
[17:25] it is I don't mind living here right
[17:28] amen amen
[17:30] bad as it is and as bad as they're gonna
[17:33] it's gonna happen but remember it's
[17:35] going to happen to the United States
[17:36] after we're gone all right for turning
[17:39] in and turning down and rejecting the
[17:41] prophet they're going to get their due
[17:44] but
[17:45] after about three weeks in the
[17:46] Philippines and I love the Philippines
[17:48] and they're not a total third world
[17:49] country or communist country how about
[17:51] kiss the ground when I got off the
[17:53] airplane
[17:53] [Music]
[17:55] there's a sign that says there's no
[17:57] place like home now that ain't in the
[17:59] Bible but it is there ain't no place
[18:02] like home hey man we're going to a
[18:04] Heavenly home but while we got an
[18:06] Earthly home I like to sleep in my bed
[18:08] well my pillow amen
[18:13] that was life lesson 773 but not as the
[18:17] offense so also is the free gift for if
[18:20] through the offense of one many be dead
[18:23] right and Adam all died and saying Eve
[18:27] that's right we always throw it on Eve
[18:29] but in Adam I'll die right
[18:32] much more the grace of God praise God
[18:36] the gift by Grace what is a gift eternal
[18:39] life and you shall receive the gift of
[18:41] the Holy Ghost right in in Acts repent
[18:45] that's the problem we missed that part
[18:47] you got to repent and be baptized in the
[18:50] name of Jesus Christ show me anywhere in
[18:51] the Bible anybody ever been baptized
[18:53] entitled to father son Holy Ghost father
[18:54] son Holy Ghost not even name
[18:56] it's titles to a name
[19:01] Pentecost and he said exactly what Jesus
[19:03] said in Matthew 28 19. that's exactly
[19:05] right because this is a name amen Jesus
[19:09] was looking forward and said in the name
[19:11] of the father and of the son and of the
[19:13] Holy Ghost baptize
[19:15] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[19:17] amen you don't sign your checkbook
[19:19] father do you yet you are one
[19:22] I could sign mine son of Samuel Dale you
[19:25] know how far they'd go from here to the
[19:27] door
[19:27] trash can they say I won't know who you
[19:30] are
[19:31] oh I'm Samuel wait never say oh now we
[19:33] know who you are so let's baptize in the
[19:35] name of the Lord Jesus Christ because
[19:36] that's who that's who I'm identified
[19:38] with amen
[19:40] for if through the offense of one many
[19:44] be dead much more the grace of God and
[19:46] the gift by Grace which is by one man
[19:48] Jesus Christ hath abounded unto man and
[19:52] not as it was by one that sinned so is
[19:55] the gift all right so the gift was not
[19:58] given by sin it was given for sin
[20:00] and by with me he's given for sin all
[20:02] right for the Judgment was by one to
[20:05] condemnation you eat this you die that's
[20:07] right that's right amen you eat this you
[20:10] die and like many have said before if it
[20:12] was an apple or an orange or an apricot
[20:15] we need to hand them out again because
[20:17] they don't got naked well we know it
[20:19] wasn't that it was
[20:21] the control of the Beast over Eve and
[20:23] having relations with we know that God
[20:26] you see what it produced
[20:28] that you know serpency was easy for me
[20:30] to see when I got about 16 years old
[20:33] that's right think about that
[20:37] I knew what my trouble was so I knew
[20:39] what Adam and Eve trouble was
[20:41] but the free gift
[20:44] offenses
[20:50] through the test right that's the first
[20:53] four letters of testimony t-e-s-t so you
[20:56] got to go through the test get the
[20:57] testimony you got to overcome
[21:00] the Bible says we are what Overcomers
[21:03] so we're going to have these many
[21:04] offenses
[21:07] but if you're Justified
[21:09] you're already glorified amen for it by
[21:12] one man's affair death reigned by one
[21:15] that one person because remember Adam
[21:17] tried to save Eve but he wasn't a savior
[21:19] so he couldn't save her he just had to
[21:21] take her and protect her right right now
[21:24] God our Adam can save us praise God he
[21:29] can save us he's got that salvation
[21:31] power he's able to take his soul and put
[21:34] it into you by the baptism of Holy Ghost
[21:36] Adam couldn't do that Sherry was an
[21:38] amateur God but he wasn't the God he
[21:41] wasn't the Redeemer he had no title
[21:43] Redeemer he had title of first man on
[21:45] the Earth right and he was God of the
[21:48] Earth all right but he went and gone to
[21:50] the soul
[21:52] we serve the god of the Soul that's
[21:54] where the free man comes in
[21:56] all right said bye with me
[21:58] for it by one man's offense death Reign
[22:00] by one much more they well I like this
[22:02] much more than
[22:04] they which receive a abundance of Grace
[22:07] that's me I'm like Brother Richard I
[22:09] need a lot of Grace because I'm pretty
[22:10] big guy and he's a big guy too need a
[22:12] lot of Grace all right and of the gift
[22:15] of righteousness shall reign in life by
[22:17] one now we know one thing's for sure
[22:19] we've got a faithful Ministry we've had
[22:22] a Prophet come in the end time according
[22:24] to Malachi 4 but Jesus Christ is the man
[22:26] amen amen he's the only one who can save
[22:29] your soul nobody else on this Earth
[22:31] everybody else that went through the
[22:33] womb come through the Matrix is lost
[22:37] now Jesus came through the Matrix
[22:40] but he didn't have a daddy down here his
[22:43] daddy was from above and man it was a
[22:45] supernatural birth we all come natural
[22:48] birth
[22:49] right some of y'all must not have you
[22:51] know what I mean
[22:53] therefore as by the offense of one
[22:56] judgment Came Upon all men so so when
[22:58] Adam sinned all that that's right all
[23:01] right even so by the righteousness of
[23:04] one the free gift I like what Paul's
[23:07] saying free gift Freedom Liberty free
[23:10] free free free free free free
[23:12] you know you can have all the gold in
[23:14] the world
[23:16] and it'll never save you it will
[23:19] definitely hinder you
[23:21] but it will not save you but if you'll
[23:23] come up here today and ask Jesus Christ
[23:25] in your heart free gift work ten
[23:27] thousand worlds up ten thousand brother
[23:30] Richard's light is like it's like
[23:31] brother Louise you know he's got the
[23:33] little podcast ten thousand worlds and
[23:34] brother Bob was saying it's I was
[23:36] thinking about that the other day he
[23:38] said man just one world would be enough
[23:40] if he saved my soul like one world
[23:43] that'd be plenty but ten thousand
[23:46] it's more valuable
[23:48] your soul than ten thousand worlds ten
[23:52] thousand of these worlds so take ten
[23:53] thousand of all that of all the gold and
[23:55] all the things in this world and
[23:56] multiply it by ten thousand it's not
[23:58] worth your soul you come up here and get
[24:01] a free gift all right so one the free
[24:04] gift came upon all men unto
[24:07] justification of life we know that came
[24:09] from the second Adam all right
[24:11] now in the first Adam all die second
[24:13] Adam all live right amen amen thank you
[24:17] Jesus as far as by one man's
[24:19] Disobedience what Adam disobeyed the
[24:21] word of God many were made Sinners
[24:23] that's all of us so by The Obedience of
[24:26] one shall many be made righteous amen we
[24:29] have Grace we have we have a way out
[24:32] right in the pawn shop in other words
[24:34] can't get yourself out you can't pay
[24:37] yourself out of a pawn shop somebody's
[24:38] got to come and get you out so we know
[24:40] who came and got us out the Lord Jesus
[24:42] came and got us out amen but listen
[24:45] let's don't jump back into the pawn shop
[24:46] Let's Stay Free Let's Stay Free as this
[24:50] coming up July the 4th I don't know
[24:52] which one day but you should every day
[24:54] like I've said many times before we
[24:56] celebrate Easter in one little part no
[24:58] to a Christian really every day is a
[25:01] resurrection but we honor it every week
[25:03] by coming to church all right we honor
[25:06] the resurrection so every Sundays and
[25:08] Easter to us it's a resurrection time
[25:12] moreover the law entered now once that
[25:14] the offense offense might abound so they
[25:16] had something now
[25:17] to say do this don't do this you know
[25:19] Ten Commandments all right but where sin
[25:22] abounded
[25:26] Grace did much more abound
[25:30] we can't lose
[25:33] we kind of win Grace much more abound
[25:37] amen that as Sin hath reigned unto death
[25:40] even so my grace Reign through the
[25:43] righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus
[25:46] Christ Our Lord Romans 6 16.
[25:50] no ye not that this is a continuation of
[25:52] Paul's thought you know I love and it's
[25:55] okay for people to put uh chapters and
[25:57] verses but this is a letter that Paul
[26:00] wrote he wrote a complete letter man
[26:02] just put Romans 6 16 and ever really it
[26:05] was a letter that he wrote to the Romans
[26:08] and he handed it to him and said here
[26:09] take this and read it to him so this is
[26:11] a continuation of his thought in Romans
[26:13] 5. know ye not that to whom you yield
[26:16] yourself servants to obey his servants
[26:18] you are to whom you obey all right now
[26:22] remember we we talk about a couple of
[26:24] years ago it was our 50th Jubilee and
[26:27] remember if you heard that trumpet sound
[26:30] and you didn't go free you were taken
[26:33] into the into the synagogue and they
[26:36] board your ear right amen
[26:40] there's a lot of Airborne going on in
[26:42] this country in this world right you can
[26:45] believe what you want to but you you
[26:47] wear any kind of ear rings and all kind
[26:49] of rings that means Hey listen even that
[26:52] ring
[26:53] come on I'm bound to her yeah that's
[26:55] right all right and that's okay but when
[26:57] you got them things in your nose and
[26:59] your ears and everywhere else you have
[27:01] been bored in the air with an awl yeah
[27:04] and remember you become a slave stay a
[27:07] slave never to be set free again all
[27:10] right so we don't want that we want out
[27:12] we want to be when that trumpet sounds
[27:13] we go hey
[27:16] I'm
[27:19] in my seventh year
[27:21] I'm going free amen you love the Lord
[27:24] let's read Verse 18 real quick because I
[27:27] don't want to be overtime because I
[27:28] don't want them to be overtime when
[27:29] they're teaching so being then made free
[27:32] from sin you became the Servants of
[27:34] righteousness
[27:36] all right that's why they call it a
[27:40] you are converted that's right from
[27:43] being a a slave of sin
[27:46] to being the righteousness of God Amen
[27:50] all right let me keep them going down
[27:52] for when you were the servant of sin
[27:55] you were free from righteousness
[27:59] you were because you weren't covered
[28:00] that's right
[28:03] but now being made free from sin and
[28:06] but you have your fruit unto Holiness
[28:08] and the end everlasting life like what
[28:11] Brother Richard said we can preach a
[28:12] message we can preach all this and do
[28:14] all this but if we don't live it that's
[28:15] right
[28:16] that's right our fruit is what we bear
[28:19] I cannot tell one tree from another
[28:22] except for what it's fruit amen come on
[28:26] musicians
[28:27] uh
[28:30] so the fruit is what we're looking at
[28:33] right man all right
[28:35] for the wages of sin is death yes but
[28:39] the gift of God free gift Hallelujah
[28:43] is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our
[28:46] Lord God bless you
[28:47] [Applause]
