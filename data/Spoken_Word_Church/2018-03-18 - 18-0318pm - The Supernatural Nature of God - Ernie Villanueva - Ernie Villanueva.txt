[Music] holy holy I want to see amen thank God for Supernatural site amen I'd like to be able to go right into the word if you would turn with me to the book of Ephesians and chapter one and we're gonna start reading from verse three I want to thank all the musicians and the singers that have participated all yesterday and today and real supernatural supernatural singing and you know we're not when I say I always tell people I like the same solo solo nobody else will hear me so so I don't mess the thing up but I do like to make a joyful noise and I've got to I've got a great ten string instrument right here makes it good makes a good noise so I'm just a comfy an accompanist so in Ephesians chapter 3 that's chapter one verse 3 and before we read let's let's talk to the Lord father tonight we are gathered here in your name we're gathered here to honor you to thank you for the supreme revelation that you have given to us for including us in the family of God to be able to fellowship amongst some of the finest people who have ever walked the earth Lord people with a deep understanding of your plan and your purpose lord I thank you for this opportunity to be with brother Sam and his church pray that you continue to bless them and they've been a blessing to people all over the world father I thank you Lord for this opportunity to share your word with my brothers and sisters I pray that it would be edifying that it would be uplifting that would encourage them that would maybe perhaps let them see themself a little bit clearer through your eyes father we ask all these blessings in your precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen in Ephesians chapter one and verse three and Paul is speaking and blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with what's the next word say all oh that's a very important word you read between the lines all spiritually didn't hold back anything all spiritual blessings in heavenly places where are we seated now we're seated in heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery this message is the mystery the the whole message is the mystery and he has made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure with he hath purposed in himself God bless you you may have your seats I just want to make a couple of comments that I like to share when I wake up in the morning and it's it's a discipline that that I use and you know we fall into patterns and habits hopefully you have a lot of good habits but sometime we fall into habits that are not constructive but one of my habits is when I wake up in the morning I know that I got I've got an enemy around me I know that he would do everything he could to sabotage my plans and I know he's very very well able to step into my life he's able to cause conflict he's able to anoint an individual that I'm going to talk with to cause conflict and and that person you know you may have had a good a good relationship with that person but all of a sudden if he's not a believer one day everything changes and Satan gets into his mind and and in this conflict so I know every day when I wake up there's got to be two deaths I got a die and the devil's got to die he's got to die and we've got to kill him we've got to put him under our feet and you know the Bible says resist the devil and he will flee from you now when I think when I think about that I picture that that I'm up on a porch like this and there is a mad rabid dog down there and he's got his teeth and he's growling and the foams coming down his jowls and and if he could get me if he could latch onto my leg he would love to do real damage to me but I got a bucket of boiling hot scalding water and I just take that water and just dump it down on that dog and what do you think that dogs going to do he's going to run he's going to flee and the Bible says resist the devil and he will flee from you so resisting it's not a passive thing resisting is an aggressive thing you've got to be aggressive with your enemy you've got to let him know that you know that he's defeated you've got to let him know that he is like the old cartoon a snagglepuss the lion got a real good roar he can still roar but he's got no teeth he has no bite any more - a real son or daughter of God he can do everything he can to cause your problems but we know one thing all things work together for good for those that love him and a call together for his purpose so we're going through a trial it's a predestinated trial now if we if we set ourselves up for problems if we I'll you know there's some people I know that are in public office they just love to shoot themselves in the foot and yeah I don't know why you know the last the political season that was going on I had somebody write me an email he says you know I like some of the things that blank blank blank is saying but I wish somebody else were saying them nothing not gonna get into politics I'm not gonna mention any names but that email I like some of the things this guy's saying I just wish somebody else was saying to me hey and so you know that word politics if you take the word politics and you break it down poly pol I poly means many ticks means parasites so politics equals many parasites and and and what it is friends let me tell you if you can if you have spiritual discernment what these people now they you you take well they're a human being that's so and so that's the center of that's a congressman that listen friends if they are not a son or daughter of God they're just puppets for the devil that's just Depp was playing in their minds and Devils pulling their strings making them say things making them do things and they come in conflict with one another you know it be some people are like lawyers they can take either side of the case they could be against you or they can defend you one of the other you won't believe this but there was a town up at International Falls Minnesota and and and it was so cold up there they actually caught a lawyer with his hands in his own pocket the and that's how politicians are you know they don't care if one of their guys says something and he does they'll defend him to the hilt but if somebody else would do the same thing they want to crucify that guy and so you know that war I mean to me it's like comedy you know we have tomorrow's headlines today we know what's going to happen we know about Russia we know about the Vatican we know about the the number of the name the mark the image we know all these things brother Branham said that Russia one day is going to drop a bomb right down the smokestack of the Vatican now when he said that that was impossible they didn't have a bomb they didn't have smart bombs they didn't have computer operated bombs where they could take that bomb and aim that right down the smokestack of the Vatican they didn't have those things but they have them now all these things brother Branham was seeing those things in in prophecy and and and here we are we're living in a day we have to understand grace we have to understand the love of God those of you who are parents especially those of you who are parents of young children you know young children that rambunctious and they run around and they do something and maybe you have to go and you have to correct them but does your love for that child diminish one bit because they they made a mistake or you had to correct them we have to get in our mind we have to see ourselves through the eyes of an all-powerful God an infinite God he looks at us like are his little babies were his little children and if we make a mistake he's a okay don't do that no more and he picks us back up and he puts us back in the race when you read brother branham said something that really shocked me and I had to think about it long and hard and even now my mind kind of spins when I think about it but brother Branham said now not now Jesus being a savior it was necessary for him to predestined a race of people who would fall in order to give himself reason and purpose for being now think about that one God he's a savior and so for him to be able to fully express his attributes of Savior he had to predestinate a race of people who would need a Savior a race of people who would fall I say Lord if you're looking for somebody who needs grace Here I am right here you don't have to look any further Lord God provides for us a safety zone that safety zone is in that holy of holies and and you know sometimes we have to we have to shut off the world shut off the world and get into the prayer closet and even when I first became a Christian I mean when I went into the prayer closet it was like Ernie Ernie Ernie Ernie Ernie Ernie Ernie yep yep yep yep yeah Lord Lord Lord I need I need I need I need and see and I didn't understand how to pray but I finally found out that when you go into the prayer closet get quiet let God create an atmosphere God knows what you need before you got in that prayer closet and God loves to surprise his children God loves us get in that prayer closet and he begins to speak to us about the needs that we have which somehow we don't even have to let him we don't have to open our mouths and the answer already starts flowing there and Lord you're soaked you're so good to me Lord and you know so we talk and even if you do talk and bring your petitions take some time and let God talk back God answers every prayer sometimes he says yes sometimes he says no sometimes he says wait sometimes he says I got a better idea I'm going to adjust this need that you have and I'm gonna make it even better than you ever could have imagined that's the kind of a God we serve brother Branham he was trying to explain the love of God when when he was talking about about John and Mary now if we could really wrap wrap our our minds around this he's talking about Mary she's a good girl and she married a little bit later in life and she married John and John was he was a little bit of a rascal but he got saved and any little good life and after they were married for a while she said she said to him dear I suppose it's kind of hard for you just a new Christian I've been a Christian since a little girl but said for you to a young Christian to have to stand all the wiles and temptations that goes with it after you've sinned for so long let me tell your friends you know I wouldn't want anybody to have to go through what I went through to have the testimony that I I'm glad for the testimony but the greatest testimony is you never had to go out in the world you never had to taste a drink of alcohol you never had to go out on Satan on Satan that's the greatest testimony he said oh my you know I've got to go out and get a testimony I got to go out and taste the world and then I'll get saved and have it no no no you don't friends God will love your testimony your testimony will mean so more if you never tasted the devil's the devil sin so so he says now well it does become a battle and she said I want you to remember one thing that if the enemy does upset you somewhere and you fall and you go back into sin don't stay away from home now could you imagine some modern-day Jezebel telling her husband that she says if you fall if you make a mistake don't stay away I want you to come on home and we're gonna find a way at home this you're gonna find the same wife that you married I'll help you pray back and pray through and get back to God said I don't want you to stay away look I married you upon the basis of what you were but I married you because I loved you and she said no matter listen this this is powerful no matter what you do what no matter what you do I still love you I married you because I love you and the man that day he went to work and he was heard repeating it the place where he was working he said how could a man do anything wrong against something like that when a woman that loves him so much no matter what he did was willing to come back and take him again and try it again see now brother Branham he comes in he said now I think you will agree you have to agree this is as close to a gobble love as you'll ever hear about but brother Branham says now you take take that agape love that Mary had for John whatever you knew come on home brother Branham says now you multiply that by billions and then you have some idea of what the love of God is all about you see Satan he wants to keep us beat up with guilt and shame and condemnation he wants us to you know to go back in the station of creation in our imagination back to those memory banks and he wants to anoint all the things you did all the sins you made and and we're tempted to Oh Lord I'm sorry sorry I did this and he wants us to get into that state but when we come and we try to confess a sin that's already in the Sea of God's forgetfulness God can't remember it God has no record of it god is the only one that can forgive and forget we need to have up-to-date revelation of justification true justification and the bride is the only one that can have the level of justification that we have Luther had a wonderful level of justification but our justification is so much greater so much deeper we understand things that Luther could not understand we understand things that Wesley couldn't understand we understand things that the early Pentecostal fathers couldn't understand brother Branham says now he says the perfect type of our Ephesians today we come out under Luther we went under sanctification and the Methodist came out under the restoration under Pentecost exactly like it was the wilderness journey when God brought us out we did very well but what did we do wanted to be like the rest of them now we find out that grace is the only thing that takes us through you go into a lot of denominational churches and you find the same people every month they walk down the aisle they try to get saved make us make a mistake see they come and they get in the atmosphere anything everything's okay but when they go back out because they're not sealed because they don't have that whole ego they don't have that repellant against sin they don't have the insight to be able to recognize a temptation one guy I wouldn't recommend this but one guy he said you know I can resist everything except temptation and the devil loves those kind of people oh my I mean they're his five-star people you know never met a temptation they didn't like never met a temptation they could overcome but the bride is different the brought your supernatural being friends we're here on a mystical supernatural journey we know we know about there many people even brother Branham when he in his early ministry he didn't know about about beyond the curtain of time he was thinking well you know brother Neville he might be over here might be a little cloud and when you get to heaven you know you kind of float by brother Neville's slope by you know say hello but when he went beyond the curtain of time God took him beyond the curtain of time for you and for me he told us about a world over there he told us about a supernatural civilization a faith civilization that's what we're going to friends everything will work by faith we will be known as we are known what a day you know the one thing that I still brother Sam I can't wrap my mind around this one that throughout all of eternity we will never be bored you never oh I don't know what I'm gonna do today I'm just gonna have a I'm gonna have a mental health day today I'm just gonna I'm gonna call inside got five sick days late up there I'm just gonna call in you know I don't want I don't want to be out there traveling like a thot today I don't want to be out there you know exploring other universes and gala I'm tired I'm bored been there done that scene listen we think we're great because the last 120 years or so man has gone from the horse and buggy days to the astronaut day do you think that's a big thing with God the one who rolled off universes and galaxies and billions of stars he rolled them from his finger do you think he's impressed with what's happened in the last hundred and 20 years you think he's impressed that America took a man and shot him in the moon and they say we went to the moon brother branham said they ain't no use going there when you get there not going to find anything and we don't even know if we went there we think we went there but we don't know it's a big great big controversy there the and so so god he's going to continue his kingdom and his revelation and your experience is going to be an ever expanding experience eyes haven't seen ears haven't heard the mind of man has not even begun you we haven't even started to imagine the things that God has for those who love him and a call together for his purpose that's you that's me but we got to accept it we got to confess it brother Branham says that Jesus he's the high priest of your confession sitting at the right hand of majesty and he is waiting to make good any one of the redemptive blessings of the Resurrection sitting there waiting for you to send him into action brother Branham said now if you don't confess it it doesn't do you any good it's a direct quote brother Branham says he can't even go to work on your case until you confess it he said you're it your waste of time if you just hoga and you think Lord you want you to confess it he loves to be reminded of his word he wants supernatural people who are living in a supernatural Kingdom who serve a supernatural God who expects supernatural responses when you give a supernatural request brother Branham says that we have too many other things on our mind besides the Word of God we're numb with the world with all the social media and work and in the world and Bishan and an relationship all these things how much time how much time let's make the main thing the main thing the main thing is eternal life the main thing is our relationship with God I see people they work long and hard building a relationship with a friend but they give go hey God thank you for this day you don't go and right off to sleep they go well little prayer little blessing great prayer great blessings brother Branham says that prayer is the greatest weapon that God has ever put into the hands of a believer and most of us were shooting blanks we got a we got a water pistol yeah well we're not really using we don't know the ammunition we don't know the power we don't know the effect when that prayer goes forth something happens when that prayer goes so if you expect it to happen faith is invisible means of support when you've got faith I was I had that chair the other day and I told brother Sam I wanted to use you know and you know people that they talk about you know about you know well I don't have faith yeah when you walk into a room and somebody says well we'll go ahead sit down and use walk down sit down right but you see if you didn't have unconscious faith in this natural realm when somebody told you to sit down you say well just wait a minute before I sit down on there I gotta check this thing out I got to see I got to make sure this thing sturdy here I gotta make sure you know let me see it's the back solid oh okay well okay then like yes I'll sit down but we don't do that so many things we do unconsciously and God wants us to have unconscious faith automatic faith natural faith spiritual faith supernatural faith I mean how how many times do we have to see what God did through the Ministry of brother branham no we were talking about Paul and all the beatings and whipping everything he went through that he said besides all that the care of all the churches now Paul he had you know the churches the seven churches the seventh Rome currently in Galatians Ephesians but what did brother Branham have brother Branham he had the whole world on his shoulders technology had increased telephone service had increased and people were able to be contacted by the word and he had he here he was he was a humble little man with not very much education and yet the responsibility for taking it and it was just like Paul Paul Paul he had to do a radical supernatural surgery the only known religion at that time was Judaism and that's what Paul came out of and Paul he had to try to take them and turn them from there and oftentimes he was not successful and so God said okay go to the Gentiles go to the ones that have zero zero understanding about God zero experience and you got to take them and you got to walk them right you got to take them through their first steps show them what God is show them how to act show them how to behave and Paul he had to take water what a transformation he had to take these these they were raw heathens pagan knew nothing about God and brother Branham said you know most Christians today they don't know any more about God then a Hottentot knows about Egyptian nights now if you know a lot of people do we have people that were translating the message they want to know what a Hottentot is they have no idea I didn't know what a Hottentot was the first time I heard that did anybody else know what a Hottentot was the first time he heard that word there people over in another country there people who have no education no knowledge and brother branham said the Christians today know no more about God than the Hottentots know about Egyptian nights the people were translating for we had to translate what a Hottentot is then we had to translate Egyptian nights because they had a night and they had stars over there and they had Egypt underneath it you know that's that's how they were translating it an Egyptian night so I mean that's a powerful statement and brother Bram said they know no more about God than a rabbit knows about snowshoes how much do you think a rabbit knows about snowshoes and that's the condition that people are in they think they know their God they think they know that that God's three I said people I said do you really believe you really believe there's an old man like a grandfather kind of figure sitting on the throne and he's got his young son and he said he's here at the right hand and the bird is eternally flapping his wings up here the white dove I said is that is that how you see God well you know I don't know it's a great mystery we won't understand these things that we get to heaven what a lie of the devil friends I'd like to have you take a look at the book of Zechariah in chapter chapter 4 chapter four verse one and the angel that talked with me came again and wait me as a man that is wakened out of his sleep and said unto me what sayest thou and I said I have looked and behold the candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes of the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side there so I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my lord and the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest not what these be and I said no o my lord I don't have a clue then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts who art Thou O great mountain before zerubabbel now shall become a plain and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace we need a double portion of grace in this day and Satan's Eden in the middle of Jezebel religion with the anointed ones at the end times all around us we need a double grace moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands of Zerubbabel aid the foundation of the house his hand shall also finish it and thou shalt know the Lord of Hosts has sent me unto you for who had despised they have small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro the whole earth then answered I and said unto Him what are these two olive trees good question what are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof and I answered again and said unto him what be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of himself and he answered and said knowest thou not what these be and I said no my lord then said he unto me these are the two anointed ones which stand by the Lord of the whole earth now we know that zerubabbel is a type of Christ we know that these two anointed ones that are there we know as Moses and Elijah we know that that the world is coming to the Statue of a perfect man we've come through faith and virtue and knowledge temperance and patience and godliness and brotherly kindness and the capstone of love God's perfect love is coming down to seal each one of us in it's not a corporate experience it's an individual experience you can't you can't rely on brother Sam or brother Wade you can't really it's a personal experience God does not have grandchildren he only has sons and daughters of God now when we look in the when we look in the Bible we look in the Bible and we discover the amazing amazing love and grace that God has had for our brothers and sisters that have run before us which starts right in the garden right in the Garden of Eden and we know that God had grace with Adam and Eve we know God had grace on Noah and his family we know that God had grace on Abraham you know God told Abraham what he was going to do and Abraham way - the way - the way - the way and finally Saracen well Abraham you know I think you ought to do it a different way you know you know I'm all dried up I can't have a baby but you still have seed I'm gonna get my my servant girl you go in there that's how we're gonna have a baby okay so ever that's the way you want it to be I guess we'll do it that way and what do they predict Ishmael oh my you want to talk about it's a seed of discrepancy that was one wrong decision and look at what we have got in the world today look at the mess that we have got look at the mines untamable unregenerate that they're against that they're against everybody and they will kill you if they think is going to fulfill Allah will then we look Abraham when Abraham and Sarah were walking down and you know walking just you know innocent and here comes the king's men now they're all old man the old woman according to the chronological age but this man come and he that they're always on the lookout for beautiful women for the King and so they walk up to Abraham's well who who's this lady that you with oh that's my sister oh it's your you're a blessed man because tomorrow you're gonna become the son-in-law the brother-in-law to the king and they take Sarah start getting her all ready for the wedding what do you think Abraham was going through at that time here's his wife taken away from him and he knows that he did not he told a half-truth what they call a white lie told half truth and so now God and here's a bit black he's all getting ready you know rub-a-dub-dub one king in the tub getting all ready for the wedding and and so God comes at a bit my leg you're as good as a dead man in a bit I said Lord what did I do he said you got another man's wife you're getting ready to marry he said Lord you you you know the integrity of my heart he had to be a man of integrity if he challenged God to by him he said that man told me that that was his sister he God said I know what he told you he said but that man is his that that woman is his wife now here's what I'm gonna do for your Bimala you go and get that man that lied to you and you bring him here and ask him to pray for you and I'll forgive you grace of God and his son goes and does the same thing you know and we all through the Bible grace grace great look at look at a Samson my Samson he had everything going for him but he had a problem with women and has a serious problem and any fault if he falls in love with Delilah ma'am brother branham said that Delilah she was a real Jezebel she was a Jezebel of a higher proportion and so Samson falls in love with her and and so everything's fine and then the men come and they want to get Samson Samson's as little SH brother she little shrimp just a little guy but strong rip apart animals take the gate of the city put it on his back march down the road with the gate of the city on his back Philistines were not happy with this guy they wanted him dead and they saw their chance that Delilah will give you a big money I don't know how much but it was big money you just find out his secret and so she Samson I know I love you and want to share things I don't want to have any secrets between them look where where's the secret of your power so he tells her a little white lie and she goes and tells the soldier here they come ready to get him and he whips them sends him on their way and she said Oh Samson you don't love me you didn't tell me the truth so he tells her another life she goes tells a soldier here they come whips him again out they go over and over and finally she wears him down where's him God it's all right all right delight the secret is in my hair that's my secret she goes and tells the soldier she cuts his hair and the same old routine here come the soldiers Samson gets up he's ready to go give him a whipping ain't no power anymore it's gone and they take them and they lock him up and they put out his eyes and they have a great big convention at the Coliseum and all the ferret all the Philistines I mean they're all there here's the one that killed all these thousands of Philistines and yet here they got their enemy their sworn enemy his eyes plucked out wrapped up in Chains they said well we got it we got to get some production out of him and they put him on the the grinding wheel here he goes on the grinding wheel he wasn't too strong didn't have much power he's going around the grinding wheel and they are having a hallelujah celebration up and in the Philistine land and and weeks go by and he starts grinding a little bit faster and they say hey look he's getting he's getting better we're getting more production out of that guy and then he goes a little bit faster a little bit faster a little bit faster and then he reaches back whoa oh my my hair is growing back and he goes into confession he Lord he said Lord just one more just once more Lord and he goes there and he has the boy take him over to the post and you know if that was me if I was the Philistine the Philistines captain I would have shaved Samson's head five times a day he would have been as bald as bulk there would not have been a Buddha of a fiber ever pop up out of his bald head but he got that power by said Lord just once more and down come the whole building and in death he killed more Philistines than he ever did in life now we don't want that kind of a testimony friends but God shows us how he moved he shows us his love look at David and the mistakes that David look at King Saul it me before I came to the message if anybody had ever tried to convince me that King Saul was saved Ida said no if I was a prosecutor I say okay first of all he disobeyed God second of all he tries to kill David God's anointed over and over has a posse track him down and David's got such character he could have wiped he could have killed him took his coat took his spear you know and and and his secure office all your security details not too good and so now he goes to the which his own law said if anybody goes to a witch it's death now he goes to the witch and he's all wrapped up she doesn't know he's the king so he tells her she said I don't want to do that there's a law the kingdom if anybody does that you go ahead do it so she does her hocus-pocus and up comes the prophet and the Prophet looks down says Saul what's going on here why have you called me from my rest he says he said the Spirit of the Lord has left me disobeys God tries to kill David kills all the priests for hiding David goes to the witch calls up Samuel and then he says the Spirit of the Lord has left me and I want to know what's going to happen Samuel says you and your sons will fall in battle and tomorrow you will be with me talk about amazing great Saul's going to be the choir director of The Amazing Grace there I want to shake hands that's all you really cut it close didn't you buddy but with God there's no cut Nicole it's grace it's the sea of God's forgetfulness and they had to receive that under the blood of bulls and goats how much greater have we got it under the shed blood of the Lord Jesus Christ by His stripes we were healed physically mentally emotionally healed if you believe it if you confess it if you practice it I just give you a little illustration there was this guy and he arrived in New York City Manhattan he jumps in a taxicab and he said quick how do you get the Carnegie Hall the cab driver turned around he said practice practice practice how do you become a warrior for Christ you practice you believe you confess you read you listen you study you pray you become a warrior invincible indestructible no matter what the devil does to you when you've done all the stand stand if I stand the devil can't make me do anything he can't make me raise my hand he can't make me raise he can't make me do anything neither can he make you do anything if you don't allow him to we don't want to be weak in this day further Bram said the church ages you know they think they're rich increased with Goods and have need of nothing especially not a message from from uneducated a seventh grade guy from Kentucky they don't need that I was telling brother Sam one of the brothers told me that that when brother Branham when he had his seven church aid sermons that he had preached when he agreed to have them translated you know a grammar eyes and a bridge input into proper English with with the spelling and everything he said brother Branham agreed to do that to give the theologians a chance to see the message in other words if that was the first thing they got was a church age book with no spelling errors no grammatical errors make just maybe they might see it now they say wow wow this is God and then they get into the message and the overlooked you know the other things that maybe would have stumbled them if they hadn't had a church age book to start the church age book is like a teething ring for a little baby teeth on it especially for somebody who thinks they know something about God I resemble that remark I thought I knew something about God didn't know anything and I still don't know near as much as I want to know and every day God reveals something new to me out of his word I look I search I have message that I've read ten times and the eleven time I see how did I miss that how did I overlook that one the message is fresh manna brother Brandon he talks about you know that the Levitical priest age and then they had to go there and they got big old baskets and they had all these Omar's full of the manna and it would take that and put that into the Holy of Holies and it was only for the Levitical priesthood and brother Branham said anybody who was going to become you know gonna become a priest he would have a chance to get a little piece of that manner maybe it was hundreds of years old but they got a chance to eat manna never got stale long as it was under the Holy of Holies and they got a bite of it brother Branham said now we in this age you don't have to be eldane Levitical for every born-again son or daughter of God you have a right you can eat all you out of it you can gorge yourself with it what a privilege that is friends grace grace you know I wonder where I wonder where the guys like like old Dwight Moody are when when he got the revelation of grace he ran outside in the first person he said do you know grace grace they said grace who Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me your brother Brandon said if Saul Paul if he was alive today they'd have him in jail in a couple of days I wonder where's that anointing that was on Paul well I said in my mind I would love to benefind the wall when he tried to convince the Apostles that he was the real deal oh hey they were not having any of it they couldn't they couldn't believe that there was that much grace in the world but but Paul Paul nobody preached race like Paul did you look at how wonderful God was to the woman at the well you know sometimes we just take that in the woman at the well you know she's there and Jesus says bring me a drink it's not customary you know if you knew who you were talking to you'd ask him for a drink you know and so then she said well you know when Messiah comes we know we know he'll do these things he said I am he and then said she ran into town now she just didn't run into town because Jesus told her how many husbands she had she said come and see a man who told me everything I ever did I wonder how long on that conversation was brother Sam she was convinced when she went out there she brother receives like a house a house on fire on a windy day I know where that anointing is now I wonder when we're gonna get unbuckles we got to get unbuckled we got to get unbound because when that magnet comes by the only one is going to pick up are the real sons and daughters of God everybody else is bolted down they might try to get up there they might reach no it's not for them it's not their portion not their position I love the story of the woman the little little harlot woman and she went and she got all her money that she had made from selling her body and she goes into the perfume store and the perfume God what do you want she said I want the best I want the best that you got you just show me your money she showed him the money and he probably just here get out of here she goes there and there Simon and they're using Jesus like a like a freak show conversation piece everybody who walked into that feast they got their feet washed everybody except for the guest of honor so called and this woman goes in there she takes this perfume costly perfume and she begins to wash his feet with her hair got her hair as she's washing his feet with her hair if a woman have a modern Jezebel today tried to do that she'd have to stand on her head to do it she wouldn't do a good job either Hey and then the Pharisee said oh you see you just walked in huh Oh gross if he if he was a man of God he he would know what type of person she was and Jesus says Simon come here I want to talk to you I want to talk to you a minute and he really gave him a dose of reality you know Jesus he was a truth broker he was a reality broker he dealt with truth in large doses he stripped away all the fluff all the veneer all the religious coverings and truth was his exclamation point he had thus saith the Lord and they didn't know who he was even the seventy Jesus picked them anointed them empower them sent them out they had a successful ministry think about this had a successful ministry and they come back hallelujah happy coming back to report the Jesus even the demons are subject to us Jesus as well don't rejoice because the demons of subject to you rejoice of your names on the book of life he said unless you drink this blood and eat this flesh you have no part with me and that's staggered him he Jesus all does that stumble yeah that's somebody what are you gonna do what are you gonna say when you see the Son of Man ascending and descending for where he come from they said that's it are so out of here way they went remember called anointed empowered successful ministry comeback but the random said you can't feed Pentecostal babies supernatural food it's too rich for them it makes them sick at their stomach too rich you know I know some of you or you know I'll earn the Land of Nod right now I can see you're in the Land of Nod and right after lunchtime your body just you know everything goes to your head you know I'm like the cross-eyed preacher friends I don't get much distance but I sure keep the crowd alert that's why I'm not up here that's why I'm down here you need something from this you need something more than you need your sleep yeah you need to be energized quickened stimulated activated motivated regulated you need to be an action for the king you know that you you ever see the Jews at the Wailing Wall the Jews of the Wailing Wall and they're like this is just rocking do you know why because to a Jew they considered that it would be an insult to God if they just stood there quiet they said if you're going to be communing with God you better be in motion you better be active for God I went there with a Brotherhood and we went down the Wailing Wall and there was a little cubbyhole in there and we weren't supposed to be there but you know what we did we just kept walking we just kept walking and most of the guys had their eyes closed and their rocking like this and the further back brother way to further back in that wall we got the more they were rocking and we got to the end of the thing and it was like turbo rock it was it was like that they were like the real Pharisees hey God wants us to be alert this is the midnight hours the this is a home stretch of a terminal generation the rapture could take place anytime California could go anytime that rushing could have too much vodka anytime Putin now he's going to be the king he'll be the king for as far as we know probably until the rapture safely elections going on - I think he's 24 years gonna be king gonna be the leader a Tsar wants to bring Russia back to the power that it used to be and we know you know this is not a fantasy friends Russia has got a bomb with America's name on it when brother branham saw that vision all he saw was smoke in ashes and they got a bomb like we talked about for the Vatican write down this do you do you think that you think that Russia was happy when when Reagan and the Pope got together you I was there I was there with brother Bissell and brother Milko in 1991 when that wall was coming down the Germans from the West and they II crying hugging each other they say that that that were Poland they were the first ones to stand against the the USSR and and and lacroix Lanza that had the union movement and he was a strong Catholic and the Pope was a strong Polish Catholic and he came over there and they said that that general Wolinsky they said they said you could hear his knees knocking when when he was in front of the Pope he could hear his knees knocking and the Pope just stood there you don't think there's a powerful presence and an anointing on that man if he ever walked in those doors right now with all of his regalia all decked out and his and his entourage behind them and they have the incense going and the candles go you don't think there would be a presence don't think there would be in the north not a holy anointing not a holy present but there would be a presence when that guy died we had all the American presidents they were there here's the carcass of the Pope and here's the American presidents kneeling down praying to the carcass of the Pope bushes was there Clinton was there Carter was there all there it's all what a spiritual atmosphere never felt anything like that in my life before you know the day that Tony Blair left being the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom the next day he was in Rome being baptized by the Pope he couldn't do it while he was the prime minister but he could not wait till he went back I'm sure a lot of you people here you know about Newt Gingrich right you've heard that name maybe you're familiar with them do you know that nothing it says either as third or fourth wife I don't know which one I lost count but anyway whatever number it is she is the United States ambassador to the Vatican and Newt is so proud of that he's got he's become a Catholic now I love the history I love the culture I love the tradition dumb blind miserable wretched poor naked and don't know it you know we can get a fifteen year old child in this message I can't run rings around theologians when it comes to the important things about the message look at look at Peter Peter just closing Peter walk with Jesus and he does a lot of how die for Jesus says yeah he said well before the crows you'll deny me three times Peters no way Lord impossible yeah and the pressure comes the squeeze you know God God is going to cause supernatural conditions to squeeze the bride into position and they began to squeeze those apostles and the biddies and the whippings and the cross and Peter looking from afar and a little girl young lady hey do you wanna you're one of his foe no no not me you're mistaken little Waialae another lady this ya here with him I know your language it betrays you he says no no just somebody who looks like me you know everybody's got a twin just somebody who looks like and the third one comes same thing and he denies it the third time and he curses her cusses her out for saying that he was a disciple of Jesus and the crowed and Peter went away after the resurrection when Jesus came and told him go get my apostles and tell them to come and tell Peter to come too Peter got a special invitation because when he when Simon and cleofus came back from the Emmaus Road and said he's a lie we seen him he gave us a six-hour sermon on reveal prophecy and their words seemed to them as idle tales and they believed them not and in Jesus comes shows up behind us as possible and they were terrified and a frightened suppose they had seen a ghost and Jesus says why Eve why why are you afraid why don't what are these thoughts arise he's sitting there reading their mind why the thoughts arise in your hearts it is I here handle me that wouldn't be a good idea today we need to handle the word you know the word is Jesus Christ in written form the word is Jesus Christ in a new divine order and only the bride can recognize that if you can't recognize that friends shake yourself talk to your mom talk to your dad talk to your husband a wife or somebody tears what he said true did God come in another form and deliver his word to a bride that's going to be raptured out of here is that real is it true is it true that only 1/100 of 1% of the people in the world are gonna know that and you think I'm one of them we like to sing that song one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them and so when Peter went to the tomb he looked in well he's not here but even if it is true not gonna do me any good he's never gonna want to see my sorry face around not after what I did denied him three times in the third time I even cursed denying that I ever knew him and yet he got a special invitation Jesus knew who Peter was Jesus knew he was going to deliver that sermon at Pentecost he saw all those things he overlooked the weaknesses to see the strength maybe all you can see is your weaknesses your frustration your failure your disappointments your could maybe that's all you can see let the light of God shine in France let the word illuminate your soul take what brother Branham said when you confess your sins come to God you are the spotless blameless undefiled virgin bride of Jesus Christ and you never sinned ever because God kept the only one that we have to deal with is God and if he can't remember your sins what does it matter if anybody else can so Peter he receives the grace to forgiveness how about the thief on the cross thief on the cross you know by law he deserved what he was getting and both of the Bible says both of them on the right on the left they're cursing at Jesus casting all these these these insults in them both of them but then the one on the right third pull Lord we're getting ready to check out of here but remember me when you come into your kingdom and Jesus said this day you will be with me in paradise we already talked about Paul extensively you don't think Paul had to do some mind battles you don't think the devil come and tried to flood his memory with all the things he did to those Holy Ghost filled men women and children before he got converted Saul says he said I'm not worthy to even be called an apostle but by the grace of God I am what I am oh can you say that as we stand I am what I am by the grace of God and I'm so thankful I am what I am by the grace of God oh my you know we could talk a whole we could go for days talking about the grace of God and the people we could talk about the lepers went down there down the street and if you're a leper and you walk down the street if you saw somebody coming you had to scream out unclean unclean and whoever was down the road they were warned and they got out of there quick and then they went to Jesus and Jesus he he told them go ahead all will be well those 10 of them and and as they went as they walked they looked at Peter Simon what's happened to you I don't know but the same things happening to you and they rejoiced 10 of them going down the road but then one of them one of them turned around I gotta go I gotta go give thanks I've got to go give praise and when he went back and he praise the Lord and Jesus would that King discernment he says were there not ten that were cleansed but where's the nine I wonder how many of us that were cleanse and we're thankful were cleanse we're thankful we're forgiving we're thankful we're in the message we're thankful we go to spoken word fellowship we're thankful we have a good we're thankful for all these things but when's the last time you ever had a real good praise and worship session just you and the Lord Jesus Christ all by yourself you become a one-man concert to the one who sent a supernatural symphony into your life with the right beat the right rhythm the right harmony everything perfect and yet was wrong I guess I'm a believer now yeah everything's okay just waiting for the rapture now friends friends God he searched the Bible says that God is a rewarder of those who diligently search after him we were nobody was ever went looking for God God tracked every one of his children down but after he tracked him down he said now now look for me look for me and my word look for me by revelation look for me in the lives of your brothers and say that's the greatest revelation friends when you can see Jesus Christ all around you walking in flesh the imperfect beings that we are in the flesh but in God's eyes we're already perfect and we're never going to be perfect in this flesh on this it won't be till we step into that next dimension that faster dimension then it's all over this power it's father Grace is such a wonderful gift a wonderful present that you have given to us unmerited favor with God not one of us ever did anything we were not good enough we could not be good enough to merit the grace of God in Lord I pray that you would take each understanding my own included my understanding of truly what was accomplished in your life what was accomplished at Calvary what was accomplished at the resurrection what was accomplished at your ascension what was accomplished when you sent each one of the church age messengers including Paul the Prophet messenger what was your intent for sending Elijah before the great and dreadful day of the Lord to turn my heart back to the faith of my Pentecostal fathers back to the same faith that Peter had same faith that Paul had same faith that that all the Apostles that walk with Jesus had it is available France is it easy no we're going to have to fight for every inch of ground but every step you take you claim it hey Lord I've claimed this I've claimed what you are I've claimed what I am in you Father it doesn't matter what the world says the world is fading away it's passing away all's it is is a temporary diversion a temporary insanity that I have to look at I'm in the world but I'm not of the world I want to ask your friends if you tonight if you say Lord I want a double portion Laurie of the grace that I have received up til now and I want to I want to understand to appreciate how fortunate how blessed I am how supernaturally privileged I am to know what I know and to see what I see and to hear what I hear in this day living in the most exciting time that a son or daughter of God has ever walked on the face of the earth with great anticipation knowing the news knowing the headline God has sent his news man into this generation and has a formed us ahead of time warned us of Hell told us about beyond the curtain of time I just pray that that today when in your quiet time that you will just spend some time all by yourself just you know it's a sacrifice some time to pull yourself away from social media and phone and ever sacrifice sacrifice o giver living for Christ is living for others pull yourself away friends I pray father that each one tonight would be able to live that life live a life that is worthy of the gospel and the only way we can become worthy is when you make us worthy father we thank you for this day we thank you for the Assembly thank you for brother Sam and brother Wade and brother brother Terrence and all the leadership of the church the song leaders those who clean the musicians father this is all a body

matter what their life has been let us receive them the same way that Jesus would receive them we ask in your precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen I think the only the only song that that I feel would be fitting would be Amazing Grace and no we sang saying it earlier but let's sing it one more time I want to thank you for being such a wonderful group of believers sons and daughters of
