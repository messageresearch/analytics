[19:45] the seasons of Life We have them my
[19:47] brothers and sisters We have seasons and
[19:50] We have to depend on the lord through
[19:52] All of it through All of it I was
[19:54] sharing with my family Yesterday and as
[19:57] I'm learning I'm continuing to learn I
[20:00] am learning Every day my brothers and
[20:02] sisters but I learn on this Journey It's
[20:05] as a Christian You're going to be
[20:06] blessed there's no question about that
[20:09] You're going to be blessed opportunities
[20:12] favor provision all Those things Come
[20:14] with serving the lord and on the other
[20:16] Side You're going to have challenges my
[20:18] brothers and sisters but Those are just
[20:21] tests I said It's just like College When
[20:23] God allowed me to go to College I went
[20:26] to College And I wasn't serving the lord
[20:27] right but I knew was an opportunity that
[20:29] the lord Had given me to be in a Place
[20:31] to to learn something different from
[20:33] Where we come from was from the Hood we
[20:35] came Straight from the Hood so Going To
[20:38] College meant a lot to me for the First
[20:40] Time I could see differences you know
[20:43] instead of Just Maybe Just struggling
[20:44] with bare Life Where we came from And I
[20:48] knew It was a Place of opportunity so
[20:50] Every day even not as a Christian I
[20:51] brought the you know I Had a picture of
[20:54] Jesus on my wallse we came from a
[20:56] Christian background and um after a
[20:58] While it were Still there but we were
[21:00] doing all kind of things in the room and
[21:02] things like that Party and all kind of
[21:03] Stuff so I knew It was a Place of
[21:06] opportunity and we also Had plenty of
[21:09] tests real tests math test english test
[21:12] and if you didn't study you would fail
[21:16] That's simple but if you
[21:18] studied you would pass that test so
[21:22] although It was a Place of opportunity
[21:24] It was plenty of test And I said It's
[21:26] just like that we're serving the lord
[21:27] we're going to have tests But You don't
[21:29] have to be scared of them you don't have
[21:30] to be fearful of them you don't have to
[21:32] Run away from them If You're studying
[21:35] and if you study you pass and you'll
[21:37] Just Keep going you'll Keep going and
[21:39] like brother Ryan was bringing out You
[21:41] Will Stay in that water passing Those
[21:43] tests amen so I thank the lord Just want
[21:46] to share that with you Cuz That's
[21:48] exactly What we're facing my brothers
[21:49] and sisters and each One of Us have that

[42:53] praised Thank the lord Jesus this a
[42:56] testimony
[42:57] um sometimes things come up and It's
[43:00] something that happened in the past but
[43:02] it came up Uh this morning on my heart
[43:05] and
[43:06] um It's just about Broken families Cuz
[43:09] I've been able to experience that in my
[43:11] family itself my Sons don't have their
[43:14] fathers in their Life they're there but
[43:15] they're not there so It's been Pretty
[43:17] much Me And It's just been a lot going
[43:19] on but I see the lord restoring things
[43:21] Of course and um my youngest son
[43:24] grandmother called me um Yesterday and
[43:27] She said Uh She said you know It's
[43:30] really been on my heart about Broken
[43:32] families Black families to be more exact
[43:35] even though We have all races That's
[43:37] Broken in different Times but The Black
[43:39] families came up on Our Heart and also
[43:41] on m Just just a long Time and Just It's
[43:45] just something Else to see when you see
[43:47] it and you just see the the the
[43:49] brokenness and even my son Just coming
[43:50] and Getting out of trouble Just got into
[43:52] some trouble recently and Just the
[43:54] things we're dealing with and the things
[43:55] he got to go through with consequences
[43:57] of the choices he made and It's just
[43:59] It's just
[44:00] been it Just was a shocker and it hurts
[44:03] Because as a Mom you trying to do the
[44:05] best you can and with God help of course
[44:06] It makes it easier but It's Still hard
[44:09] when you see your children got to deal
[44:10] and go through things that you didn't
[44:11] want them to have to go through but God
[44:13] knows what they need and um anyway this
[44:17] this Child came On My Mind a While ago
[44:20] in this neighborhood that Uh we grew Up
[44:22] In kind of lived in for about 10 years
[44:24] When Isaac was about um maybe six so It
[44:28] was like a It was an eight-year-old
[44:29] Little Boy his name Was khalil and I'll
[44:32] Never forget him And I wasn't even
[44:33] thinking about him but he came on my
[44:34] heart this morning and he was a Bad
[44:36] Child he was a little troublemaker in
[44:38] the neighborhood and All the other Kids
[44:39] kind of knew it Cuz he Just Had this
[44:42] Thing That ca trouble you know and you
[44:43] just Almost want to Stay away from your
[44:47] children so um during that Time the lord
[44:50] was dealing With Me too but I wasn't
[44:52] fully in yet but the lord Still was
[44:53] dealing with me so I was trying to get
[44:55] it right but I wasn't fully living right
[44:56] but in that season um I remember Just
[45:01] telling Isaac you know let's Just pray
[45:02] for this Little Boy he need Prayer
[45:03] instead of Us you
[45:05] know condemning him or Talking About him
[45:07] let's pray for him he needs Prayer and
[45:09] his mother would Always kind of say Bad
[45:11] things to him and Just Treat him kind of
[45:13] Bad to And I noticed That I kind of was
[45:14] like Man That's That's not good you know
[45:16] and Uh so One Day um Me And her Had like
[45:19] a small conversation we weren't Close or
[45:21] anything but we end up Talking About
[45:22] Something I don't know I ran into her
[45:24] and we was talking and at that time the
[45:27] lord was dealing with me on like the
[45:28] words that we say and How it got Power
[45:30] in it so somehow I brought up to her
[45:33] about kind of The Way She was talking to
[45:36] him not not in a way to Tell her What to
[45:38] do but Just somehow the conversation
[45:39] came up And I was Like You Know
[45:41] Something of the sort Of You know Maybe
[45:43] the words that You're saying might be
[45:45] affecting him but I didn't I don't
[45:46] remember exactly How I said it but It
[45:48] was very peaceable not to kind of Tell
[45:50] her What To Do Or How She should Do it
[45:51] but somehow it came up but anyway Little
[45:54] by Little this Little Boy started to
[45:55] change and It was obvious Because he
[45:58] wasn't that way but I was Just
[46:00] remembering this today on my on my r to
[46:01] Church And I was like Wow the power of
[46:03] Love Not Just praying for him we started
[46:05] treating him with love too and Just
[46:07] treating him kind as we could and he
[46:09] started to change this Little Boy
[46:11] changed And um It was It was Just so
[46:14] obvious Cuz It was the opposite so I'm
[46:16] just want to bring up the power of Love
[46:17] and Prayer even When things Don't look
[46:19] like it can change or get better Love
[46:22] Prayer changes things I just want to
[46:24] bring that Up

[1:28:03] días de Abraham Y
[1:28:05] Sara no dice así no no no así como fue
[1:28:09] los días
[1:28:11] de así fue como los días de
[1:28:14] Noé entonces allí dejó
[1:28:18] escondido el misterio de Abraham y sar
[1:28:25] porque en Génesis
[1:28:27] 18 El hijo del
[1:28:30] hombre se reveló a
[1:28:33] Abraham primero trató con
[1:28:36] Abraham estuvo detenido con Abraham por
[1:28:39] mucho
[1:28:40] tiempo revelándole el misterio
[1:28:44] aah revelándole el misterio
[1:28:49] a hasta 1965
[1:28:55] Pero él le dijo a
[1:28:57] Abraham en el tiempo de la
[1:29:00] vida Yo
[1:29:02] volveré y Sara tendrá un
[1:29:05] hijo así que él estaba hablando Ya de
[1:29:08] Sara Pero Sara estaba
[1:29:11] escondidita estaba detrás de la
[1:29:14] tienda porque porque el hijo del
[1:29:18] hombre
[1:29:20] Elohim estaba detenido con Abraham
[1:29:24] Pero Sara recibirá una
[1:29:28] visitación Aleluya entonces Esas cosas
[1:29:33] quedaron escritas
[1:29:34] allí para que nosotros podamos ver que
[1:29:38] después de los días del
[1:29:40] Hero El hijo del hombre tenía que
[1:29:44] continuar ahora en esta sala de
[1:29:48] hoy porque este es el
[1:29:50] día génes
[1:30:02] Dios visitó
[1:30:08] Abraham está
[1:30:12] visitando alabado sea su
[1:30:15] nombre Porque a través de los
[1:30:19] tipos podemos Dios
[1:30:22] haciendo que Dios hizo en
[1:30:25] Sara en lo que Dios hizo en
[1:30:27] Rebeca en lo que Dios hizo en
[1:30:31] Rut en lo que Dios hizo en
[1:30:34] Ester en todos los aspectos
[1:30:38] femeninos podemos ver lo que Dios está
[1:30:40] haciendo
[1:30:41] hoy con nosotros en este día así que en
[1:30:45] Génesis
[1:30:46] 18 ahora ahora Yo estoy trayendo
[1:30:50] esto porque el misterio del hijo del

[1:30:54] no
[1:30:55] concluyó cuando el hermano branam se
[1:30:58] fue no

[1:31:09] Eternamente
[1:31:14] perdidos el Ministerio del hijo del
[1:31:17] hombre a la mitad de la Biblia
[1:31:21] concluyó con la resurrección de los
[1:31:23] santos y la predicación a los
[1:31:25] perdidos Así que el Ministerio del hijo
[1:31:28] del hombre en este día no
[1:31:32] concluyó cuando el hermano branam se
[1:31:35] Ju tenía que continuar Porque el hermano
[1:31:39] bran no entró a la predicación de los
[1:31:41] Eternamente

[1:33:12] perdidos tenía que venir la
[1:33:15] resurrección tenía que venir la
[1:33:18] resurrección pero hermano br se

[1:33:31] hace Allí es donde tiran
[1:33:36] flechas Yo sé que no
[1:33:39] aquí están bien
[1:33:42] entrenados pero esto está saliendo por
[1:33:44] la vía de
[1:33:46] Internet Pero Aleluya el Ministerio del
[1:33:50] hijo del
[1:33:51] hombre en el hermano pran
[1:33:54] tenía que ir a la predicación a los
[1:33:59] perdidos y y a la resurrección de los

[2:08:40] branam entró en el tercer
[2:08:43] jalón y el Ministerio comenzó a
[2:08:45] desarrollarse hermano
[2:08:48] br comenzó a desenvolverse
[2:08:53] Aleluya el Ministerio del hijo del
[2:08:56] hombre primeramente en apocalipsis
[2:09:00] 17 y el hijo del hombre en el tercer
[2:09:05] jalón Tuvo tres partes la primera
[2:09:09] parte del tercer jalón fue cuando la
[2:09:13] palabra
[2:09:14] hablada operó en el Ministerio del
[2:09:16] hermano
[2:09:17] br creando cosas la segunda parte del
[2:09:22] tercer jalón fue la
[2:09:25] apertura de los siete sellos la
[2:09:30] apertura y la apertura
[2:09:32] significa el
[2:09:35] inicio
[2:09:37] Aleluya la apertura de los siete

[2:10:30] jal lo que seguía era la
[2:10:33] predicación a los Eternamente
[2:10:40] perdidos voy a citar otra
[2:10:42] cita miren hacia
[2:10:49] Jesús es el mensaje también que nosotros
[2:10:52] lo tenemos en español apartando la
[2:10:54] mirada hacia
[2:10:59] Jesús dice se está

[2:11:08] tiempo y la presión llegue a tal
[2:11:12] grado de que
[2:11:15] ustedes se han echado fuera por la
[2:11:18] presión entonces fíjense
[2:11:21] en lo que estoy a punto de decirles en
[2:11:23] unos
[2:11:26] minutos observen El tercer jalón
[2:11:29] entonces y será
[2:11:33] absolutamente para los que están
[2:11:35] totalmente
[2:11:36] perdidos pero será para la novia y la
[2:11:43] iglesia Gloria a
[2:11:45] Dios hablando de un tiempo que va a
[2:11:50] venir observen El tercer
[2:11:54] jalón y él está
[2:11:58] hablando de una predicación a los
[2:12:00] Eternamente
[2:12:04] perdidos Así que después de que el hijo
