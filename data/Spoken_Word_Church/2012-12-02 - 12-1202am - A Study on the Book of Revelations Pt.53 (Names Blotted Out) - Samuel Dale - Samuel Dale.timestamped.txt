[33:51] 1 now a lot of them especially on the
[33:57] Joseph just Rachel's family this morning
[33:59] they're probably worn out because they

[34:05] over and punch him you know to wake up
[34:08] he'll be all right we be no problem all
[34:11] right Revelations
[34:13] 1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which
[34:16] God gave unto him to show unto his
[34:17] servants things which must shortly come
[34:19] to pass and he sent and signified it by
[34:22] his Angel unto his servant John who by
[34:25] record of the word of God and the
[34:26] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[34:29] things that he saw blessed is he that
[34:31] readeth and they that hear the words of
[34:33] this prophecy and keep those things
[34:35] which are written therein for the time
[34:38] is at hand now what is that time the

[34:43] we're down here don't you amen at the
[34:45] end of all things okay Revelation
[34:49] 6:9 excuse me verse 12 and when he had
[34:53] opened the sick seal and lo there was a
[34:56] great earthquake quake and the sun
[34:58] became black as sackcloth of high and
[35:00] the moon became as blood and the stars
[35:03] of Heaven fell into the Earth even as a
[35:05] fig tree casteth her untimely figs when
[35:08] she's shaken of A Mighty Wind and the
[35:10] heaven departed as a scroll when it is
[35:12] rolled together and every mountain and
[35:14] Island were moved out of their places
[35:16] great earthquakes and things right right
[35:21] right and the kings of the earth and the
[35:24] great men and the rich men and the chief
[35:26] captain and the Mighty Men and the every
[35:28] bondman and every Freeman to hid
[35:30] themselves in the HS and in the rocks of
[35:32] the mountains and said to the mountains
[35:34] and rocks fall on us and hide us from
[35:37] the face of him that sth on the throne
[35:39] and from the Wrath of the Lamb you may
[35:43] be seated the Lord had his Blessing to
[35:45] the reading of the word but however
[35:46] brother here he's been here before with
[35:49] us but it happened that's number one so
[35:51] we got another visitor this morning we
[35:54] say welcome to you and just sit back and
[35:58] relax a little
[35:59] bit we've been quite a while in a
[36:03] study of and you forgive me for the
[36:06] cough drop the Cod like I always say
[36:08] either cough drop or shut
[36:10] up so I have to have a problem with my
[36:14] throat when I start trying to preach
[36:17] preach sometimes straight through it's
[36:18] okay next time it starts clogging up so
[36:22] uh just forgive me for taking a cough
[36:25] drop but that's part of life I guess
[36:29] we've been quite a while now in the
[36:31] study in the Book of
[36:32] Revelations and we've gotten over now
[36:35] into the six seal and we're trying to
[36:38] cover not just individually seals and
[36:41] and make an order of that we've been in
[36:43] the Book of Revelations for quite a
[36:45] while and just kind of moving along real
[36:48] slow and gradual trying to understand
[36:51] some things and coming down through and
[36:54] seeing as we'll get to um maybe the Lord
[36:57] willing this evening A Plan of
[36:58] Redemption all the way through the Bible
[37:02] and see it but we'll just see how it
[37:04] goes may have to cut off and take part
[37:05] of this this afternoon all right but now
[37:09] listen there is only six seals written
[37:13] in the Bible amen right all right the
[37:16] seventh seal is not written it says
[37:18] silence in heaven Revelations
[37:21] 81 all right so then there's only six
[37:24] seals to reveal The Plan of Redemption
[37:28] that's right that's what I've been
[37:29] trying to get us to and we're on the
[37:31] Sixth Seal now seeing the complete Plan
[37:33] of Redemption and we covered this past
[37:38] uh week there that all names are
[37:41] revealed a prophet said on the sixth
[37:44] sealen before the seventh opens on his
[37:47] coming amen all right now see then the
[37:51] seventh seal is not going to deal with
[37:53] Redemption I'll tell you that ahead of
[37:55] time but it will will redeem will be
[37:58] dealing with possession
[38:00] amen possession more than redeeming see
[38:05] uh as we'll get to it this afternoon the
[38:06] prophet covers that the word Redemption
[38:09] is in two parts out of into two right
[38:14] all right see and we're still here our
[38:16] soul is Redeemed by the new birth but
[38:19] our body is still in this old world and
[38:21] you know needing Redemption all right
[38:24] then it will go on all the way to the
[38:27] world will be redeemed one day right you
[38:30] know amen you also the Plan of
[38:32] Redemption is not over just because we
[38:34] think it would be it it it continues on
[38:39] but we'll be dealing only with six seals
[38:42] as to revealing us the Plan of
[38:46] Redemption all right that way then you
[38:48] can take it and do is we we've tried to
[38:51] do through the series that you can take
[38:53] uh first second third fourth seal and
[38:56] cover just justification sanctification
[38:58] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[39:00] restored word to come in the end time
[39:03] all right then you can go back and see
[39:05] as the prophet said the field 6 and S
[39:08] seal shows how he done it right amen all
[39:11] right so what did we
[39:13] do Phil seal shows the greatest
[39:17] understanding of justification am could
[39:19] ever be our Grace right because there's
[39:22] a group of people that actually don't
[39:24] want eternal life right
[39:27] that fil seal Jew that was would be
[39:29] killed from Calvary down to the ending
[39:31] us going up the prophet said they
[39:34] actually don't care anything about
[39:36] salvation they're still under the Old
[39:37] Testament rulings that's right all right
[39:40] and being under that then that's the
[39:42] greatest understanding of justification
[39:45] amen because justification means what
[39:48] right when it comes down to
[39:50] finality justification means you didn't
[39:53] do it right sure we were guilty
[39:57] we done it right but then God looks down
[40:00] and says you never done it
[40:03] am and I love that now watch that
[40:05] through the message today that he he
[40:08] keeps his
[40:10] curses he puts a curse on something he
[40:13] doesn't remove that curse right amen but
[40:16] he keeps his promises amen right he
[40:19] never forgets his promises he always
[40:21] holds that that promise to where that
[40:24] you can depend upon it if you can find
[40:26] it written in the Bible you can call him
[40:28] on the
[40:30] scene why because he said it
[40:33] amen there I quoting one ago praying
[40:38] that it says that he sent his word and
[40:41] healed us right right and delivered us
[40:44] from destruction you know why I depend
[40:47] on that sir he said if you believe on
[40:50] the Lord Jesus Christ you shall be saved
[40:53] I believe I depend on
[40:55] that I I love his promises amen but I
[40:58] also have to admit that there's a lot of
[41:01] curses within the word right the word if
[41:05] we go After idols and other things then
[41:08] we're cursed all right and we should be
[41:11] because it should not be any uh excuse
[41:14] today as to understanding about the true
[41:18] word of God Amen all right so the fifth
[41:21] seal shows you justification Sixth Seal
[41:24] would deal with sanctification amen
[41:26] because it means cleansed and set aside
[41:29] amen all right when we get over in a
[41:32] minute you'll see that that we pick up
[41:34] in the seventh chapter of Revelations to
[41:37] show that who's going to be redeemed in
[41:40] this Great Tribulation that is coming
[41:43] upon the Earth this is not tribulation
[41:45] this is pre-tribulation right I mean
[41:48] this this is not a a bad thing yeah we
[41:51] think it is but I'd like to stay around
[41:54] here quite a while you know the way
[41:57] things are going wouldn't you I I sure
[41:59] I'd like to be well I'd like to be young
[42:01] yeah but you know we're we're all pretty
[42:04] well
[42:07] fat right we're not being persecuted
[42:11] we're not be in troubled for what we
[42:14] believe things going pretty good all
[42:18] right but I don't want to stay around
[42:19] here because I want to
[42:22] go and meet the Lord you that's my
[42:25] desire that's my point all right the
[42:28] much as I talk about him here I
[42:29] certainly want to see him when I get
[42:31] dark all right so then we're in studying
[42:35] of all names the prophet
[42:38] said paragraph 155 I think it is souls
[42:42] in
[42:43] prison all names being revealed on the
[42:45] sick seal right all right so then we're
[42:50] studying about these that are being
[42:52] revealed we went through the ages to see
[42:56] the bride of
[42:57] Christ and we've covered the foolish
[42:59] virgins that would come up under those
[43:01] ages and actually be given eternal
[43:04] life and then as I said we went into the
[43:06] fifth seal Jew to see that that's where
[43:08] Paul said all Israel be saved right no
[43:12] not ever
[43:13] Israelite right no no no he said not all
[43:17] Jews are Jews you right not all
[43:19] Israelite not every person is going to
[43:22] be saved right right all right but the
[43:25] predestin
[43:27] all right then we went into covering the
[43:30] from the foolish virgin and come into
[43:32] the
[43:33] bride now we're down to
[43:36] Revelations 7 to where that there's
[43:39] 144,000 of the children of Israel to be
[43:43] redeemed right all right and then doing
[43:45] that then we see as I said there's only
[43:48] six seals to the Bible That's why Ruth
[43:51] was given six measures of meal right
[43:55] barley right all right she was given
[43:58] that showing that 6,000 years of mankind
[44:02] would be upon the Earth right right and
[44:05] that she would then if she held on she
[44:08] would be redeemed that's what Ruth
[44:10] needed right she needed a redeemer she
[44:13] needed someone who could pay the price
[44:16] and Boaz could do that but he really was
[44:19] redeeming Naomi right y by redeeming
[44:23] Naomi then he automatically right
[44:25] received Ru so that was a wonderful
[44:27] thing God came to redeem
[44:30] Israel his chosen people right amen but
[44:33] when they turned him down he came for
[44:35] the Gentiles and that's where we are to
[44:37] be happy all right but that he would
[44:40] carry
[44:42] over until to Ruth take that and hold it
[44:46] Naomi said until he finishes The Plan of
[44:50] Redemption all right
[44:52] now so then the Plan of Redemption would
[44:55] come
[44:56] here in the end time do you and I yes
[44:59] cuz the full Plan of Redemption has
[45:01] never come until the end time no that's
[45:03] right down to the ages they talked about
[45:06] salvation they talked about a place to
[45:07] go they talked about a heaven they
[45:10] talked about a happy Hunting Ground um
[45:13] there's not much difference if you'll
[45:14] study it and you'll see them a little
[45:16] more this evening there's not much
[45:17] difference the old Indian happy Hunting
[45:19] Ground than there is to most people's
[45:21] thinking of heaven right you know but we
[45:25] come to find out that we've seen the
[45:28] Plan of Redemption all
[45:30] right but now church I believe and have
[45:32] tried my best to get to you one
[45:36] thing the complete Plan of Redemption
[45:39] was finished at Calvary amen that's
[45:42] right which meant all those Old
[45:44] Testament Saints that's why he had to go
[45:47] and preach to as Peter would call it the
[45:50] spirits in prison right once he was
[45:52] crucified see he left he went down in so
[45:55] and preached to right all right because
[45:58] Jesus
[46:00] Christ died once for all amen the Old
[46:04] Testament people that blood of bulls and
[46:06] goats was just pushing y it it wasn't
[46:10] eradicating sin right right because
[46:13] there was no life in that animal to be
[46:15] able to come back upon the human being
[46:16] right so it could only just push that
[46:19] sin forward and when it did Jesus Christ
[46:22] at Calvary strung his arms out to get
[46:24] the old and the new everything plan all
[46:26] right that's right and see then he would
[46:28] bring in the complete Plan of Redemption
[46:30] there is no
[46:33] Redemption outside of Jesus Christ amen
[46:37] so no matter what it is or what group of
[46:39] people we're talking
[46:41] about it all has depended upon whether
[46:44] or not Jesus was that as we called it in
[46:48] the in the Greek Etc Hebrew one the gold
[46:51] g o e l I think or a l which one it is e
[46:54] l I think right it means that he
[46:58] is 10
[47:01] folks it means that he
[47:04] is capable of paying the price amen
[47:08] that's right see when when uh bo bought
[47:12] Ruth he had to pay the price right now
[47:15] what if he didn't have no money to pay
[47:16] the
[47:17] price so he's got to
[47:20] be able to pay the price he's got to be
[47:23] willing to do it righten you remember in
[47:25] The Book of Ruth that says that there
[47:28] one closer to
[47:29] K he had a right to
[47:32] redeem boy had to deal with him y so he
[47:35] went down to deal with him and when he
[47:37] did read the book of Ruth he said you
[47:39] redeem The Rock he said I'll redeem it
[47:43] y was like in bad
[47:46] shape but Boaz was pretty
[47:49] smart so what did he
[47:52] say he said the day you redeem Naomi
[47:58] y you remember y Ruth and the other one
[48:02] there their husbands had died and
[48:04] Naomi's husband had died and that was
[48:06] why the Boaz was next to Ken he said but
[48:10] the day you redeem Naomi M you got to
[48:13] take Ruth y you remember Ruth was a
[48:17] gentile right so that old stoms Jew in
[48:20] the natural story he
[48:23] says yep because the problem
[48:29] was he was going to have to have
[48:31] children by Ruth that's right to keep
[48:35] the lineage going because that was what
[48:37] was had to be done that was
[48:39] where Tamar and Judah got into the
[48:43] problem see they had to if if if a
[48:45] brother died
[48:47] is you know his wife she could go to the
[48:51] the next brother could take her and but
[48:53] he raised up the first child went to
[48:56] that name right it didn't go to his name
[48:59] so that old St Jew in the natural
[49:01] stories I say he said uh-uh ain't going
[49:04] to do it boab said
[49:06] okay I'll pay the
[49:09] price cuz you and I you know what we
[49:11] were whether you like it or not you may
[49:14] think oh goody goody how goody you are
[49:16] and how goody goody you been but you
[49:19] know what we all born kin folks to the
[49:21] devil amen that's right whether you like
[49:23] it or not right amen that's right we
[49:26] were born lost doomed and on the way to
[49:29] hell and deserving every bit of
[49:32] it but God came down and paid the price
[49:36] he didn't send the second
[49:38] one he didn't stay up there and send the
[49:40] son down as we talk and organize
[49:42] religion on the Trinity right you know
[49:44] we us teach that God stayed up here the
[49:46] father he sent the son down well now
[49:48] it's where you get into those Eternal
[49:50] sunship
[49:51] deals you get into the Catholics you'll
[49:53] learn a lot about eternal sunship and
[49:56] how can you have an eternal
[50:00] son that don't make
[50:03] sense whether you understand it or not
[50:05] don't make sense you say I'm an eternal
[50:08] son well who's your daddy right well
[50:11] he's dead gone yeah well I ain't too
[50:14] much on that on doing it right but see
[50:18] instead of him sending a son he came
[50:21] himself to pay the price amen the of God
[50:26] said he didn't trust the Plan of
[50:27] Redemption with anyone else am I love
[50:30] that word he said he came
[50:33] his all right to pay the price that you
[50:36] and I could be
[50:37] saved so then the Plan of Redemption is
[50:40] right through the word of God right and
[50:44] as I said we getting to the six seal we
[50:46] talking about a
[50:47] purging because we read of even the
[50:49] mountains the rocks and the different
[50:51] things and people cry out for them to
[50:53] fall on them and and many things are
[50:55] happening
[50:57] there as the world is being purged these
[51:01] little things we see out here amateur
[51:04] tribulation tribulation when it comes to
[51:06] the Great Tribulation is the wrath of
[51:09] God poured out this is not the wrath of
[51:11] God for that that's why I said I'll stay
[51:13] here with it if you want to you know I
[51:16] hope not too much longer cuz I'm getting
[51:18] old anyway but you know maybe he can
[51:21] slow these things down but listen Church
[51:26] then in doing it we look at this
[51:29] Redemption under the six seal to find
[51:32] the last of the names amen
[51:35] right because if you deal in the the
[51:39] bride of Christ you deal in the Old
[51:42] Testament Saints as we'll try to do this
[51:44] afternoon or Wednesday night when you
[51:47] deal with that then you can deal with
[51:48] names cuz that's what this Bible is
[51:51] right this Bible is a look a book of
[51:54] names now your name might not be in
[51:57] there my name Samuel's in there but that
[51:59] don't make it too good you
[52:04] know so you don't want to go that line
[52:07] especially the boys don't want to go
[52:09] that
[52:09] line right you remember Samuel's Sons is
[52:13] the one that messed everything
[52:15] up so they certainly don't want me to
[52:18] claim that name Samuel yeah right and
[52:20] them be the sons of Samuel right but
[52:23] what did he say he said AR Nevil is not
[52:26] written in the Bible he said but what is
[52:30] happening at the time amen that arm
[52:33] Neville is on Earth is written in the
[52:35] Bible right this Bible is full of
[52:39] names and it's a
[52:41] record of what's going on during the
[52:44] time that name is here right amen right
[52:46] right all right so then if there's
[52:48] anything in there that I need purging
[52:50] out I need to get rid of the
[52:53] here all right right so we went through
[52:56] the Redemptive plan for the bride we
[52:58] went through the and hit it just a
[53:00] little bit of the foolish vergins how
[53:01] that she'll come up and be given eternal
[53:04] life all right we went through the F
[53:06] seal JW to see that those names will
[53:09] come up there and now we're talking
[53:12] about the life group of
[53:14] names that will be on
[53:17] Earth but don't go to the foolish don't
[53:20] go to the white Throne women down too
[53:21] quick cuz you're passing up because
[53:24] those names are here now right that are
[53:27] going to go to the white Throne right so
[53:30] all names is revealed while you and I
[53:33] here you and I are here in the Plan of
[53:36] Redemption right amen all right
[53:38] everybody that go to the white throne
[53:40] their name will be made on Earth first
[53:42] that's right before the white Throne so
[53:44] don't try to run that way with it just
[53:46] leave
[53:46] it and see we see these
[53:51] 144,000 and as we see
[53:53] them we we find out some other things
[53:56] about him that are uh really
[54:01] amazing of how
[54:03] God makes a promise keeps a
[54:08] promise but how he makes a curse and
[54:10] keeps that too that's right he never
[54:12] forgets his promises but he never
[54:14] forgets his curses amen we're seeing a
[54:18] little bit that Dan and Ephraim was
[54:20] taken away from the children of Israel
[54:22] as tribes that's right y
[54:25] M all
[54:29] right but were their names deleted or
[54:32] what happened
[54:36] right we talk about Redemption as I said
[54:40] this that we're talking about today in
[54:42] the next service or so is a foundation
[54:44] for going on into the seventh sealen so
[54:47] I would listen very carefully to the way
[54:51] that things are
[54:52] stated because I say them the way I want
[54:55] want to say it right and I mean it the
[54:58] way that I say it don't sum up and say
[55:00] brother Dale did you mean so and so no I
[55:02] said what I mean right now if I goof up
[55:05] in
[55:06] language you know that's no problems you
[55:09] know if I say 6,000 600 or whatever
[55:12] something like that that's you just to
[55:15] worry about that part of that silliness
[55:17] but let's get down to think about
[55:21] it all names to be revealed
[55:25] when this sick seal comes into being
[55:29] right right cuz that's the
[55:33] finish the finality of
[55:35] Redemption on this Earth will be done
[55:39] when these people that we're going to
[55:42] read about come to their
[55:45] Redemptive I said on earth now did you
[55:47] follow me
[55:49] yes see there is a foolish virgin to go
[55:51] to the white Throne that's later yes but
[55:54] their names are here here now right it
[55:56] won't be any extra ones added by right
[55:59] all now so we're talking about
[56:02] Redemption whether or not we can find
[56:05] our
[56:08] name if we can't find our name in the
[56:13] book then maybe it might not be in the
[56:15] book right right that's just amen carnal
[56:20] thought but it's true
[56:22] right I want to find my name brother
[56:25] said talking about it there about John
[56:26] he said God opened one of the seals to
[56:29] let John see his
[56:32] name well he said has your name been
[56:36] made known through the opening of these
[56:42] seals have you come into a Redemptive
[56:44] plan by the opening of God's
[56:52] word all right now let's just read
[56:55] something and take this a little talk
[56:58] and try to move on a little bit and and
[57:01] see something from this six seal
[57:03] remember now we're going over to
[57:05] Revelations 7 because that is the
[57:08] listing of the 144,000 that are to be
[57:11] sealed in the six seal all right go
[57:13] ahead brothers and pull it
[57:16] up
[57:18] now as we get to
[57:21] this I want you to remember names
[57:27] names see the world
[57:30] thinks that or some of the
[57:32] denominations think that this 144,000 is
[57:35] the bride of Christ M do you
[57:40] know but it says 12,000 from each tribe
[57:45] and it lists the tribes of Israel right
[57:47] oh we're spiritual Israel well that's
[57:50] all right yeah but I don't have to be
[57:53] connected to a tribe that's right
[57:56] right because now we can take most of
[58:00] these brothers
[58:03] here and show you there there's some
[58:05] pretty bad things going on yeah right
[58:08] right
[58:10] right Y what was the first was it Judah
[58:13] that took his father's wife one of them
[58:17] did
[58:19] Ruben took his father's
[58:21] wife lot of things them Fell's done yeah
[58:24] we don't want to be associated with
[58:27] right
[58:29] right Dan and Ephraim went
[58:32] after some golden caves that's right now
[58:36] that's not the story where Moses and the
[58:38] and the you know the making that's a
[58:40] different story in the
[58:43] Bible we don't want to do
[58:46] that especially when they had their
[58:48] names deleted under
[58:50] heaven but that's what we want to deal
[58:52] with how God can be so perfect
[58:56] that what he
[58:58] says is correct amen amen but what we
[59:04] think it says sometimes don't work out
[59:06] too good so we better change our
[59:09] thinking and get down to thinking about
[59:11] things all
[59:13] right this is
[59:15] Revelations 7 you can read all the way
[59:18] down and heard the number of them which
[59:20] were sealed and there were sealed
[59:23] 144,000 of the rbes of the children of
[59:28] Israel all right remember the
[59:32] names because that will be very vital in
[59:35] just a minute of the tribe of Judah were
[59:38] sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Ruben was
[59:41] sealed 12,000 of the tribe of GAD was
[59:44] sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Asher was
[59:46] sealed 12,000 of the tribe of nepalm or
[59:50] how you pronounce these word you
[59:51] pronounce them I can't were sealed
[59:53] 12,000
[59:55] of the tribe
[59:57] of
[1:00:01] Manasses were sealed
[1:00:04] 12,000 of the tribe of Simeon sealed
[1:00:08] 12,000 tribe of
[1:00:10] Levi sealed 12,000 Tri of isar was
[1:00:14] sealed
[1:00:16] 12,000 of the tribe of Zebulon were
[1:00:19] sealed 12,000 other tribe of Joseph were
[1:00:22] sealed 12,000 right of The Tribe of
[1:00:25] Benjamin were sealed 12,000
[1:00:30] MH now I said remember
[1:00:34] names so with this incident in
[1:00:36] Revelations
[1:00:37] 12 I mean
[1:00:41] 7 Dan is not
[1:00:53] listed and
[1:00:55] uh according to the
[1:00:59] Bible
[1:01:02] Manasses was not a son of Joseph right
[1:01:05] or Jacob excuse me he's a son of Joseph
[1:01:11] right
[1:01:13] okay see we just take brother brandom
[1:01:15] and we'll just quote and then we don't
[1:01:18] get into the Bible to see what it's
[1:01:19] saying that's right
[1:01:21] amen true we so d EP was the two that
[1:01:25] was left
[1:01:28] out
[1:01:32] Ephraim was not a son of
[1:01:38] Jacob he's the son of
[1:01:43] Joseph well do we need to know
[1:01:46] this I don't
[1:01:48] know go to
[1:01:51] sleep we'll wake you up the service is
[1:01:53] over
[1:01:58] but God keeps his promises that's
[1:02:01] right we want to deal with that don't
[1:02:05] we but he also keeps his
[1:02:08] curses why in this reading of Revelation
[1:02:12] 7 is Dan
[1:02:15] missing and manasse put
[1:02:23] in
[1:02:27] what
[1:02:29] happened okay you said well I don't know
[1:02:32] about that well okay we'll just go back
[1:02:33] let's go to Genesis now and remember now
[1:02:36] Manasses remember Dan's missing out of
[1:02:42] this back it back down make sure you
[1:02:44] read the names correctly you don't find
[1:02:48] Ephraim listed
[1:02:51] here you only find the missing of Dan
[1:02:54] and Manasses put
[1:02:57] in well I just read what brother well
[1:03:00] why don't you read the Bible that's
[1:03:03] where you got it that's
[1:03:06] right now let's read the sons of Jacob
[1:03:09] cuz we think that's a sons of Jacob but
[1:03:11] gassis is not a son of
[1:03:13] Jacob he's a son of Joseph that was a
[1:03:17] son of Jacob amen now let's read
[1:03:21] in
[1:03:23] Genesis
[1:03:25] let's pick this
[1:03:27] up and it says and the sons of Jacob
[1:03:30] were
[1:03:31] 12 that's
[1:03:35] good Reuben
[1:03:38] Simeon
[1:03:39] Levi
[1:03:41] Judah
[1:03:43] isar
[1:03:45] zebulun Joseph and Benjamin y
[1:03:50] Dan netha Gad Asher
[1:03:59] so
[1:04:01] now when you start juggling things
[1:04:04] around you have to know where you going
[1:04:07] that's
[1:04:10] right Joseph look at the next quote so
[1:04:12] everybody will know
[1:04:14] it the sons of
[1:04:17] Joseph after their families was manasse
[1:04:21] and Ephraim
[1:04:23] right
[1:04:26] okay so remember that that's the sons of
[1:04:29] Joseph not the sons of Jacob Joseph was
[1:04:33] the son of Jacob
[1:04:36] right but why in The Book of Revelations
[1:04:39] is Dan
[1:04:45] missing when we read here that it's 12
[1:04:49] tribes of Israel and we read in
[1:04:51] Revelations there was 12 tribes of
[1:04:53] Israel
[1:04:56] yet all at once God has taken out
[1:04:59] Dan and he's placed manasse in this
[1:05:07] place
[1:05:09] why what what's
[1:05:13] happening
[1:05:17] right so let's read something about
[1:05:20] it I want you to remember these things
[1:05:22] cuz some things are going to be said to
[1:05:24] today that are going to be driving
[1:05:27] points for ler all right go ahead to the
[1:05:30] next
[1:05:31] one this is on the seventh seal the
[1:05:33] prophet of God speaking paragraph 225
[1:05:36] now all when he called them over there
[1:05:38] the
[1:05:39] 144,000 they were missing that's right
[1:05:42] you talking about Dan and Ephraim right
[1:05:44] they're not even numbered in there and
[1:05:46] Joseph and Levi is put in the place of
[1:05:49] Dan and
[1:05:53] Ephraim
[1:05:59] brother why are you dealing with Joseph
[1:06:01] and Levi being put in and Joseph and
[1:06:04] Levi
[1:06:06] were the children
[1:06:09] of
[1:06:13] Jacob that's right going make a
[1:06:15] beautiful story in just a
[1:06:17] minute now we can look out right there
[1:06:19] it's before
[1:06:20] you here God's promise way back there
[1:06:25] hundreds and hundreds of years before
[1:06:27] that now what happened they were
[1:06:30] purged now remember he's speaking of
[1:06:33] Joseph and Levi and Dan and Ephraim
[1:06:41] right listen to
[1:06:43] it and here God's promise way back there
[1:06:47] hundreds and hundreds of years before
[1:06:49] that now what happened they were Pur
[1:06:52] during the time of the awful tribulation
[1:06:54] perod now God's going to purge that that
[1:06:57] virgin that was a good woman foolish
[1:06:59] virgin you know but she just failed to
[1:07:02] get oil in her lamp and he's going to
[1:07:04] purge her through persecution in there
[1:07:07] he puts them
[1:07:10] tribes
[1:07:11] yep right in there for the same thing
[1:07:14] and purges them during the time of the
[1:07:16] tribulation period because it's a
[1:07:18] purging it's judgment but you see
[1:07:22] they
[1:07:25] now whether or not you've ever studied
[1:07:26] the Bible enough to know and a lot of
[1:07:29] people don't do that cuz they just say
[1:07:31] well I just read what brother Rand
[1:07:33] said but remember he got to be a word
[1:07:35] Prophet amen yes sir problem Sol
[1:07:40] amen so if you take
[1:07:42] out Dan and Ephraim and you put in
[1:07:45] Joseph and Levi and you got
[1:07:48] 12 what are you going to do with Dan and
[1:07:52] epan when we're going to reading the
[1:07:54] same Bible when we get to it that Dan
[1:07:55] and EP is put back in right
[1:08:00] right I've asked this question to many
[1:08:02] ministers and they you know they kind of
[1:08:04] shrug me as an
[1:08:06] intellectual that's all
[1:08:08] right I thought we needed
[1:08:12] intellect U I'd like to swap with some
[1:08:14] of you in brain
[1:08:17] capacity I surely would be an
[1:08:20] intellectual I've got a ninth grade
[1:08:22] education
[1:08:24] but the word of God is perfect
[1:08:27] amen amen now you got 144,000 listed in
[1:08:31] Revelation
[1:08:35] 7 and here you got 144,000
[1:08:40] listed but you got a problem with
[1:08:42] dealing with two more tribes so you got
[1:08:45] 144,000 plus
[1:08:48] 24,000 now what are you going to do with
[1:08:50] that
[1:08:52] 24,000
[1:08:57] did we read it
[1:09:00] right in one group you got Dan and
[1:09:03] Ephraim missing and the other group you
[1:09:04] got Dan and Ephraim which we'll read in
[1:09:06] a little bit Ephraim is not listed in
[1:09:07] Revelation 7 we know that but we'll get
[1:09:10] back to it in a minute don't worry about
[1:09:14] it what are you going to do with another
[1:09:18] 24,000 I've ask that question to people
[1:09:21] because I'm
[1:09:22] serious
[1:09:25] if it says one time Dan and Ephraim is
[1:09:27] taken out and then it says another time
[1:09:29] Dan and Ephraim is put back
[1:09:32] right say Dan and ephra taken out and
[1:09:34] Joseph and Levi put in and then Joseph
[1:09:37] and Levi taken out and Dan and ephra put
[1:09:39] back but before that gets to where they
[1:09:42] put back cuz they're not even deleted at
[1:09:44] the point you got Joseph his two sons
[1:09:47] that will come in which will be manasse
[1:09:49] and
[1:09:52] Ephraim
[1:09:56] that's not a contradiction in the Bible
[1:09:58] there perfect order amen perfect tribal
[1:10:01] order but it's dealing with what's
[1:10:03] taking
[1:10:04] place and when you're dealing with
[1:10:06] what's taking place
[1:10:08] then you can see
[1:10:10] things all
[1:10:12] right
[1:10:16] now so he said he puts those
[1:10:19] tribes them
[1:10:22] tribes
[1:10:26] in there for the
[1:10:29] purgy Now where's Dan and from going get
[1:10:31] their purging if we find them in the
[1:10:33] millennial Reign
[1:10:35] right back in with the children of
[1:10:46] Israel cuz you see you're dealing with a
[1:10:48] prophecy
[1:10:52] MH and Dan and
[1:10:56] Ephraim is left
[1:11:00] in all the
[1:11:03] records of the Old
[1:11:09] Testament you don't find a scripture
[1:11:12] that say Dan and Ephraim was
[1:11:19] deleted see we just take a story from
[1:11:21] blood randam and we just summarize a
[1:11:25] Theory Y and we think we know what we're
[1:11:27] dealing
[1:11:32] with I just asked that simple question
[1:11:34] I'm an intellectual y boy I'm
[1:11:36] smart but I mean how much education does
[1:11:40] it take to take 144,000 that's 12,000 of
[1:11:43] each tribe 144,000 and then you got two
[1:11:46] more tribes to deal with and that's
[1:11:49] 24,000
[1:11:51] and Josiah can figure that out for us
[1:11:54] right that deals with 144,000 plus
[1:11:57] 24,000
[1:11:59] right but we know all about
[1:12:06] Redemption do
[1:12:07] we that's one of always try to tell
[1:12:10] people see they get after me about like
[1:12:11] Daniel 70 weeks yeah of why I preached
[1:12:14] it like I
[1:12:15] did they think Daniel 70 weeks is a
[1:12:19] confusing
[1:12:22] Doctrine
[1:12:24] I just laid something out in front of
[1:12:25] you that is very
[1:12:28] confusing see ever Doctrine in the Bible
[1:12:31] is confusing until it's
[1:12:34] revealed the new birth is a confusing
[1:12:37] matter in the prophet's message I can
[1:12:40] show where you were he said did he Reed
[1:12:42] it in the Woodshed show you were he was
[1:12:44] running down a railroad
[1:12:46] track different things not contradictory
[1:12:51] no
[1:12:52] right I'm not that stupid like the
[1:12:54] people this message are doing now that's
[1:12:56] right
[1:12:59] amen he says one day I conclusively
[1:13:02] prove that you're born
[1:13:03] again and then baptized into the body
[1:13:08] yes then another time he says you're
[1:13:10] baptized into the body that's a new
[1:13:11] birth every Doctrine in the Bible is
[1:13:14] confusing until it's revealed right one
[1:13:18] God is a vastly confusing
[1:13:22] thought
[1:13:24] until the world is deceived by the
[1:13:26] doctrine of the trinit concept that's
[1:13:29] right God in three person Blessed
[1:13:31] Trinity there's no such thing in the
[1:13:33] Bible amen that's right nowhere in the
[1:13:36] Bible is there Trinity spoke of
[1:13:40] right yet millions of millions of people
[1:13:43] today believe in
[1:13:45] it that's right right then here you come
[1:13:48] in the message oh we're supposed to
[1:13:50] believe in
[1:13:52] it then you got two Souls Two Lords
[1:13:55] River Jordan that Jesus wasn't god Till
[1:13:57] The River Jordan then he finally become
[1:13:58] God then that left him and he just had
[1:14:00] to
[1:14:05] die come
[1:14:09] on everything is confusing until it's
[1:14:15] revealed amen yep probably said the only
[1:14:19] thing in the Bible that you didn't have
[1:14:20] to have a revelation of to be right he
[1:14:22] said was water baptism he said because
[1:14:24] anybody want to be able reading black
[1:14:26] and
[1:14:27] white but we didn't read black and white
[1:14:30] we took Father Son and Holy Ghost didn't
[1:14:32] because the Catholic Church taught us
[1:14:33] there right nobody in the Bible was ever
[1:14:36] baptized father son Holy Ghost show it
[1:14:38] to me right that's right
[1:14:41] am I can show you where the Catholic
[1:14:43] Church changed it yep by your own
[1:14:50] encyclopedias but yet we swear by
[1:14:58] the Bible said to be baptized into the
[1:15:00] name of Jesus Christ amen it don't say
[1:15:03] father son oh but Matthew
[1:15:05] 2 he said in the name singular of the
[1:15:09] father that's
[1:15:12] right you don't say names of father son
[1:15:15] Holy Ghost name singular right come on
[1:15:18] church amen where are we at
[1:15:21] right just all confusing until it's
[1:15:24] revealed that's right right so here
[1:15:27] we're dealing with something that's a
[1:15:28] very odd
[1:15:32] situation A puding in and a take it out
[1:15:34] a putting in the Tak it
[1:15:40] out now what are we going to do with
[1:15:49] it see we say that there's only one sin
[1:15:53] that we can sin to have our names
[1:15:55] removed and that's the blashe the Holy
[1:15:57] Ghost
[1:15:59] right poor Apostle
[1:16:05] Paul man's in bad
[1:16:08] shape he not only blasphemed y he caused
[1:16:14] others to blaspheme what he said
[1:16:17] am but God didn't destroy him
[1:16:21] no and didn't remove his name no
[1:16:29] right are we still in the
[1:16:31] Bible or are we dealing with man's ideas
[1:16:34] or
[1:16:36] intellectualism I'd like to know what
[1:16:38] intellectualism is if I'm an intellect
[1:16:41] to be able to quote brother Brom then
[1:16:42] you making brother brandom an
[1:16:46] intellect come on what's the
[1:16:49] matter listen
[1:16:52] Church
[1:16:53] let's just follow this line and I know I
[1:16:55] won't get done short let to see let's
[1:16:57] follow this line of Israel through the
[1:17:01] Bible we've
[1:17:04] established from Genesis
[1:17:07] 35 believe is what it was that Joseph
[1:17:11] had 12
[1:17:12] sons Jacob excuse me so if I change the
[1:17:15] name y'all put it in the place I'm 72
[1:17:17] years
[1:17:18] old I ain't forgot everything but
[1:17:21] there's a lot of things I have forgot
[1:17:27] so that's
[1:17:31] what the sons of Jacob was
[1:17:37] 12 right Reuben Simeon Levi Judah ezar
[1:17:42] jebin Joseph Benjamin Dan Ephraim G man
[1:17:47] Asher that was his offspring MH all
[1:17:51] right now let's go over to the next one
[1:17:54] and read something so I want you to
[1:17:55] watch some of these
[1:17:57] things and then it'll give you a key to
[1:17:59] be able to study the Bible yourself from
[1:18:03] it as a matter of fact I wish you'd just
[1:18:06] take the Bible and figure these names
[1:18:09] out cuz I've done
[1:18:13] hours of trying to get it all
[1:18:16] together to make sure itd match
[1:18:21] up
[1:18:24] now look what it says
[1:18:27] now Exodus 1
[1:18:31] 1-13 now these are the names of the
[1:18:34] children of Israel which came into
[1:18:39] Egypt every man in his household came
[1:18:42] with
[1:18:46] Jacob Now read the names Ruben Simeon
[1:18:50] Levi Judah ISC zein Benjamin D and NEPA
[1:18:54] Gad and Asher that's
[1:18:58] 11 see the Bible is perfect CU read the
[1:19:01] next verse and the souls that came out
[1:19:03] of the Lords of Jacob were 70 Soul for
[1:19:05] Joseph was in Egypt
[1:19:10] already the Bible answers this own
[1:19:12] question that's right there's only 11
[1:19:15] Sons up here why Joseph was already
[1:19:17] there in
[1:19:19] Egypt you remember the
[1:19:21] story
[1:19:24] that his brother sold him into slavery
[1:19:27] right all right he goes down into
[1:19:35] Egypt now don't answer this cuz I'm
[1:19:37] going to pull a trick question okay just
[1:19:39] remain silent don't say nothing it'll be
[1:19:41] all
[1:19:43] right if I ask you how long was
[1:19:49] Israel under the
[1:19:51] bondage in Egypt Egypt 90% of you would
[1:19:55] say 400 years plus 30 for the
[1:20:03] rejecting you say that God caused the
[1:20:07] children of Israel to go down into Egypt
[1:20:10] for the trouble they were
[1:20:15] in but none of that's
[1:20:17] true that's
[1:20:19] right remember Joseph was sold and slave
[1:20:22] slavery about 36 37 of Genesis about 48
[1:20:28] he comes back out
[1:20:31] Victorious I mean he's still in Egypt
[1:20:33] but he's
[1:20:36] Victorious that's why it only lives and
[1:20:38] then it says Joseph was in Egypt already
[1:20:41] see Joseph was sold to
[1:20:43] Egypt he becomes the number two man with
[1:20:46] the pharo
[1:20:48] right so when the Jacob goes to Egypt it
[1:20:52] is not for punishment it is because of
[1:20:55] the drought in the land that's right it
[1:20:58] was a Providence of
[1:21:01] God because Joseph had already had a
[1:21:07] dream that his family would bow before
[1:21:15] him how is God going to get that to work
[1:21:18] out he drives up the
[1:21:21] land we does what he wants to he has his
[1:21:24] ways of get things done that's right so
[1:21:26] he just drives the land
[1:21:28] up
[1:21:31] Jacob you got them boys they done told
[1:21:35] him that Joseph was killed by Lind or an
[1:21:38] animal ate him up you
[1:21:40] know they don't tell him they sold
[1:21:43] him they thought they'd never have to
[1:21:45] deal with him and they went away
[1:21:47] sneakers he said we going to vow for
[1:21:51] him we took care of him
[1:21:53] yeah yeah so Joseph goes down to
[1:21:57] Egypt as a
[1:21:59] slave
[1:22:01] right right parer's wife accuses him
[1:22:08] incorrectly they throw him in jail not
[1:22:10] only a slave
[1:22:13] right and probably would have killed him
[1:22:15] had it not been for the Providence of
[1:22:17] God because what would you do when a
[1:22:19] man's wife saying he's trying to rape me
[1:22:21] right right well that's what Fifer's
[1:22:23] wife
[1:22:26] said but because of the dreams of Joseph
[1:22:29] in prison and the other people with
[1:22:34] dreams we know the story he was taken
[1:22:38] from prison and interpreted Pharaoh's
[1:22:42] dream and told him what was going to
[1:22:44] happen to Egypt how that there'd be so
[1:22:46] many years of drought so many years of
[1:22:48] plenty and then there be so many years
[1:22:50] of
[1:22:51] drought he said what you need to do now
[1:22:54] Pharaoh you need to set somebody over
[1:22:58] that to kind of handle this situation
[1:23:02] well you know old Pharaoh was a smart
[1:23:03] man all them Pharaoh's wasn't
[1:23:07] dummies and all of them wasn't white
[1:23:09] either they've been Black Pharaohs in
[1:23:12] Egypt come on folks Egypt
[1:23:16] and Africa side by side they've been
[1:23:19] Black Pharaohs in
[1:23:20] Egypt on their
[1:23:23] records they wasn't
[1:23:25] dummies well
[1:23:28] trained listen Pharaoh said okay you the
[1:23:32] God has figured this thing out you told
[1:23:33] me what the dream was
[1:23:36] Y and you remember the story to show you
[1:23:38] how profit
[1:23:41] Works he called in all of the susers and
[1:23:44] says tell me the dream tell me what this
[1:23:46] dream is they said tell the
[1:23:49] dream tell the dream and we'll tell you
[1:23:51] what it is
[1:23:54] well that been man's idea that's right
[1:23:57] Pharaoh said how do I know you know yeah
[1:24:00] he said you tell me the dream and then
[1:24:01] I'll know whether you know the dream or
[1:24:03] not nobody couldn't do it cut her
[1:24:08] throat here goes old Joseph he goes up
[1:24:11] and he tells him the
[1:24:12] dream and he tells him the
[1:24:15] interpretation that's in God's
[1:24:16] Providence right right there going to be
[1:24:19] seven years of plenty then seven years
[1:24:21] of drown of things
[1:24:23] and
[1:24:24] said all
[1:24:27] right so Joseph is exalted to number two
[1:24:32] man over Egypt
[1:24:35] right he has the signant of the king the
[1:24:40] Pharaoh you
[1:24:43] remember right everybody had to Bow the
[1:24:46] knee to Joseph just as well as they did
[1:24:48] to
[1:24:48] Pharaoh cuz he was in
[1:24:51] charge
[1:24:54] the children of Israel if you understand
[1:24:56] what I'm getting at never went into
[1:24:59] bondage because of their
[1:25:02] corruption that's what we think sure
[1:25:05] they did a lot of times but not this
[1:25:11] time they went down there for the
[1:25:13] Providence of God to be worked
[1:25:15] out God's word going to be fulfilled
[1:25:20] yeah I want one scripture that they were
[1:25:23] sent down there because of
[1:25:25] their are the quotes from The
[1:25:28] Prophet but we going to read one in a
[1:25:30] minute it's going to show you where it's
[1:25:32] at but see they go down and Joseph he's
[1:25:35] already down there so now here goes
[1:25:37] Jacob trying to find out corn to live
[1:25:40] you know and the
[1:25:41] things I'm not going through the whole
[1:25:43] story of how they put the things in
[1:25:45] there and got them to bring finally
[1:25:47] Jacob comes
[1:25:49] down you remember the brothers come and
[1:25:51] they find out oh J starts talking to him
[1:25:54] he said oh he going to kill us now he
[1:25:55] said God done this to preserve life
[1:25:59] right read your Bible said his daddy
[1:26:02] still alive and doing well they said
[1:26:03] yeah said go get him when they came down
[1:26:07] there with Joseph come down went out to
[1:26:09] meet his family he' already had his
[1:26:11] little wife in The Palace that was the
[1:26:14] Gentiles one of these days he revealed
[1:26:16] himself to those Jews we're going to be
[1:26:18] at the marriage supper while he's taking
[1:26:20] out but now
[1:26:23] listen so he goes down and he says
[1:26:26] Joseph Pharaoh
[1:26:30] does you put him over
[1:26:33] there he gave him
[1:26:37] Goan what about a king that thought that
[1:26:40] much of a man yeah cuz he just saved his
[1:26:42] whole
[1:26:43] Kingdom he just preserved all of
[1:26:47] Egypt and said you got
[1:26:49] Yan most wonderful land it could ever be
[1:26:52] he gives it to him Israel don't go to
[1:26:55] Egypt as
[1:27:00] slaves no Joseph is down there to make
[1:27:09] sure but you see when they get set up
[1:27:11] there he gives them all of the land he
[1:27:14] gives everything
[1:27:18] y as he does
[1:27:21] then
[1:27:24] what
[1:27:27] happens the most work out
[1:27:30] to Exodus 31 I think was
[1:27:35] it wasn't that the one we was
[1:27:37] on yeah he was in Egypt already all
[1:27:41] right
[1:27:42] now I'm doing a lot of this to save time
[1:27:44] and you think I
[1:27:45] ain't because the same story is
[1:27:48] told in in uh as we'll go along it's a
[1:27:53] repeat a lot of times this same story is
[1:27:55] told in Genesis 468 through
[1:27:59] 24 you got a lot of repeats in there so
[1:28:02] I chose to pull out a few of them keep
[1:28:04] Bend this much time but now
[1:28:07] watch they don't go down
[1:28:12] there as slaves
[1:28:18] right they're the number two people in
[1:28:21] Egypt
[1:28:25] but what
[1:28:27] happens you've heard run around state so
[1:28:30] let's go on up and do
[1:28:32] it look at verse
[1:28:35] 8 now this is after quite a
[1:28:38] while Israel has enjoyed freedom in
[1:28:40] Egypt right under
[1:28:45] Pharaoh Joseph is the number two man
[1:28:48] over Egypt
[1:28:50] amen and his people is was in charge
[1:28:52] with everything just about
[1:28:54] it but here's what
[1:28:56] happens verse 8 said and There Rose a
[1:29:00] new king over
[1:29:02] Egypt which knew not
[1:29:05] Joseph
[1:29:12] right now by this
[1:29:19] time want you get some time elementes
[1:29:22] Along by this time Joseph is
[1:29:27] dead Joseph died in
[1:29:39] Egypt how long was he in
[1:29:42] Egypt 430
[1:29:46] years every son of
[1:29:50] Joseph I mean excuse me every son of
[1:29:54] Jacob died in
[1:29:57] Egypt not under
[1:30:03] bondage you remember Joseph said we're
[1:30:06] going out of here one day take my bones
[1:30:10] with you that's right don't bury me here
[1:30:13] in
[1:30:15] Egypt he wanted to be buried in the
[1:30:18] promised land right that's right all
[1:30:20] right
[1:30:23] but every son of Jacob died in
[1:30:30] Egypt and probably even Ephraim and
[1:30:33] Manasses right I didn't have time to
[1:30:35] correctly check it but I'm 98 99% sure
[1:30:39] even ephan and Manasses died in
[1:30:44] Egypt now
[1:30:47] watch man rose up and didn't know
[1:30:50] Joseph jph mes has done
[1:30:54] g
[1:30:55] y and he said to his people this people
[1:30:58] the children of Israel are more mightier
[1:30:59] than
[1:31:01] we now they go under
[1:31:06] bondage when the king rose up that
[1:31:08] didn't know Joseph Israel went under
[1:31:12] bondage roll it on up and read come let
[1:31:14] us deal wisely with him L they multiply
[1:31:17] to come to P that they're fth out any
[1:31:21] war and they going like under the other
[1:31:22] sides and different things you
[1:31:27] know but there are rad of King that
[1:31:29] didn't know J
[1:31:36] fa verse 13 wrote it on up and the
[1:31:39] Egyptians made the children of Israel to
[1:31:42] serve with Vigor in other words they put
[1:31:43] them under bondage they started killing
[1:31:46] them they started making them work they
[1:31:47] started killing all the babies but
[1:31:50] remember Joseph Ephraim
[1:31:54] Manasses Dan
[1:31:57] isachar
[1:31:59] Benjamin all of them are dead they die
[1:32:02] in
[1:32:08] Egypt wait a minute now we're going yeah
[1:32:10] you going to read that here but you
[1:32:11] better remember what just said they were
[1:32:13] done there 400
[1:32:20] years
[1:32:24] you say why we don't even study the
[1:32:26] Bible we study a quote
[1:32:28] Yeah a
[1:32:36] thought God never sent Israel to Egypt
[1:32:40] as
[1:32:42] slaves in this incident there's other
[1:32:45] incidents he did he put them at pharaoh
[1:32:46] and things but not in this case he sent
[1:32:50] them down there as his is real roll up
[1:32:53] the next
[1:32:54] one number
[1:32:57] 58 acts 7 and6 read the whole backward
[1:33:01] and forth look and God spake on this
[1:33:04] wise that the seed his seed should
[1:33:07] sojourn didn't say bondage right sojourn
[1:33:11] in a Strange
[1:33:14] Land that they should bring them into
[1:33:17] into bondage and in treat them evly for
[1:33:20] 400 years
[1:33:23] notice and that they should bring them
[1:33:25] into bondage they didn't go into bondage
[1:33:27] to start
[1:33:28] with come on they went down there they
[1:33:30] were victorious amen that's what
[1:33:33] happened with the church come on folks
[1:33:34] until she sold herself into bondage
[1:33:36] right that's what's wrong today
[1:33:40] right come
[1:33:42] on
[1:33:45] man all right
[1:33:49] now that was the people that went into
[1:33:52] Egypt I deleted one thing I can give
[1:33:54] them to you where it says you know this
[1:33:56] was the people that went down to Egypt
[1:33:59] we read that one cuz there another one
[1:34:00] God does a lot of things double when he
[1:34:02] does he means it but when they come up
[1:34:05] out of Egypt look what
[1:34:07] happens number
[1:34:09] six and when the children of Israel
[1:34:11] shall pitch their tents now they're out
[1:34:12] of
[1:34:14] Egypt they're not in Egypt they've come
[1:34:17] out who's going to come out and what are
[1:34:19] they going to do right
[1:34:23] and every man by his own Man by his own
[1:34:26] count I want you to notice something
[1:34:28] very
[1:34:29] carefully he never calls him a tribe
[1:34:32] until
[1:34:39] later come
[1:34:40] on what I said you go in here and you
[1:34:43] get to studying this thing you going to
[1:34:44] find out a lot of
[1:34:46] things you're going to find hours of
[1:34:48] searching scriptures to see why
[1:34:54] they were not called tribes they were
[1:34:56] called the children of
[1:34:58] Israel they're coming out of Egypt and
[1:35:01] they're going through the
[1:35:02] Wilderness and this is the way they're
[1:35:04] going to
[1:35:05] Camp okay
[1:35:09] y why would it start off real
[1:35:13] quick but the
[1:35:16] Levites she pitch round about the
[1:35:18] Tabernacle of testimony y
[1:35:22] now God's going to show his
[1:35:26] Providence more than just Joseph's
[1:35:29] Providence was it his children his
[1:35:31] brothers and Daddy and things
[1:35:33] technically I think his mother had
[1:35:35] already passed on I'm not certain really
[1:35:36] on that and if you think it is that's
[1:35:38] all right I'm not arguing I'm just
[1:35:40] making the
[1:35:42] point they were to Bow before
[1:35:45] him they did in
[1:35:48] Egypt but finally God sent Moses down to
[1:35:53] deliver the children of
[1:35:57] Israel right he brings them out as we
[1:36:01] read up there a while ago
[1:36:03] what going to send them down didn't the
[1:36:06] Bible said he's going to bring him out
[1:36:08] with a mighty
[1:36:09] hand Mighty hand was Moses with a
[1:36:14] stick it wouldn't no African Invasion to
[1:36:18] set them free I read that because it's
[1:36:20] right the next country
[1:36:23] right watch now when they starting to
[1:36:25] get out of Egypt and get out in the
[1:36:29] wilderness they're going to set up
[1:36:31] camp y but the Levites shall pitch
[1:36:35] around the Tabernacle of the
[1:36:40] testimony and we can draw out a big
[1:36:42] drawing and show the way they
[1:36:44] count and we will read here how they
[1:36:48] count they count three three three and
[1:36:53] three is that M
[1:36:55] multiplication and what that turn out to
[1:36:57] be three and three and three and three
[1:37:01] according to my understanding that's 12
[1:37:04] right but automatically he's already
[1:37:07] saying the Levites is not going to be
[1:37:08] out there
[1:37:13] right the Levites going pitch next to
[1:37:16] the Tabernacle so you would have three
[1:37:18] three three and two and one second here
[1:37:22] and that that won't work right so now
[1:37:25] we're going to find a beautiful story
[1:37:27] that God meant to come into
[1:37:36] being but the Levites shall fit round
[1:37:38] about the Tabernacle of
[1:37:40] testimony for there be no wrath upon the
[1:37:44] congregation of the children that there
[1:37:45] be no wrath upon the children conation
[1:37:48] the children of Israel that's why he
[1:37:49] puts them there why they they won't be
[1:37:51] in Wrath all right why the Levites who's
[1:37:53] the Levites the preachers right come on
[1:37:56] and the Levites are priesthood and the
[1:37:58] Levites shall keep the charge of the
[1:38:00] Tabernacle of
[1:38:02] testimony and the children of Israel did
[1:38:04] according to what the Lord told him okay
[1:38:06] now we go to
[1:38:08] numbers one which is continual reading I
[1:38:14] was right
[1:38:17] numbers one this is numbers two excuse
[1:38:19] me amen right and the Lord sping MOS and
[1:38:22] Aaron saying and every man of the
[1:38:24] children of Israel shall teit by his own
[1:38:27] standard with the inside of their
[1:38:29] father's house far off about the
[1:38:33] Tabernacle far off around it the
[1:38:37] Tabernacle congregation shall they
[1:38:40] pitch now remember the
[1:38:44] story as Paul Harvey says page
[1:38:47] two page one we found all of the
[1:38:52] descendants of
[1:38:54] Jacob as Leaders
[1:38:57] Dan and all of them and even Joseph
[1:39:03] descendants passed away in
[1:39:09] Egypt so when we read Ruben down here of
[1:39:12] Judah this is not
[1:39:14] Judah this is his descendants right
[1:39:17] right right of his
[1:39:20] tribe

[1:39:30] dead this God is not there he done dead
[1:39:34] this is his
[1:39:38] descendants I thought what you

[1:41:19] priesthood
[1:41:24] that's right the Levites in the midst of
[1:41:27] the camp as they
[1:41:29] Camp so here's the Levites in the
[1:41:32] middle we done covered south and east

[1:44:04] with
[1:44:06] now whether you like it or
[1:44:09] not you got
[1:44:16] 14
[1:44:18] Nam to be dealing with
[1:44:23] right come on 12 and M ephra and
[1:44:27] Manasses put
[1:44:31] in so you take out
[1:44:35] Levi he ain't going to be
[1:44:39] numbered and you put him in the middle
[1:44:41] of the
[1:44:45] camp now you got
[1:44:49] 13 oh oh we don't like
[1:44:55] 13
[1:45:02] 13 the Levites in the
[1:45:06] middle Dan and Ephraim manasse and all
[1:45:09] of them is gathered
[1:45:11] around see Dan and ephra went after the
[1:45:14] golden C yet they were part of the
[1:45:16] original back over under yeah when they
[1:45:18] come out of Egypt remember when they
[1:45:20] come out of Egypt they come out and they
[1:45:21] make some golden CES this is a different
[1:45:24] story that's
[1:45:26] right then and Ephraim will eventually
[1:45:29] go after golden caves
[1:45:34] right but there they are 13
[1:45:38] tribes Levites not being
[1:45:46] numbered standards of their camps and
[1:45:49] the things
[1:45:54] finally begins to call him a tribe
[1:46:00] right A
[1:46:02] Tribe cuz that's not Dan and Ephraim
[1:46:05] that's not Joseph and Leva that's not
[1:46:07] Reuben and Benjamin that is their
[1:46:11] descendants that carry their Insignia
[1:46:13] their sign of each
[1:46:17] camp and they become a tribe
[1:46:24] let me's see if I can find
[1:46:27] it well everybody should know the story
[1:46:30] but we'll get back over here Paul Harvey
[1:46:33] page
[1:46:37] 14 cuz they was originally to
[1:46:40] been we'll get this afternoon cuz I
[1:46:43] can't finish it man there was originally
[1:46:45] to have been 13
[1:46:48] tribes that's correct God's providence
[1:46:51] am I'll read where the Prophet said if
[1:46:53] you don't believe
[1:46:54] it but we just read the Bible amen that
[1:46:57] tells
[1:46:58] you Dan and Ephraim is not missing
[1:47:03] there I want you to bring it to me where
[1:47:05] Dan and eph is missing in the Old
[1:47:14] Testament but see we think know the
[1:47:16] story Dan and E the story of what
[1:47:24] well that's just no intellectual stuff I
[1:47:26] can't understand tell me about
[1:47:31] Jesus would you mind naming them tribes
[1:47:33] off and get your 14 of them Y and would
[1:47:38] you mind taking Levi out and putting him
[1:47:41] as the
[1:47:44] priesthood but would you mind taking
[1:47:47] Joseph out and making him a type of
[1:47:49] chist right right cuz Joseph is
[1:47:56] missing out of the 13
[1:48:00] tribes ephra manasse put in Joseph and
[1:48:04] Levi comes
[1:48:09] out there to us to have been 13
[1:48:13] tribes where the levite was never to
[1:48:16] been a tribe right
[1:48:18] no he's the priest of he's to stay in
[1:48:20] the middle the others were to Camp
[1:48:22] around him but Joseph is missing
[1:48:26] amen Ephraim and manasse has been put in
[1:48:29] in the place of Levi and
[1:48:32] Joseph because Joseph is a type of
[1:48:35] Christ amen so we want to talk about
[1:48:37] Christ we can surely do
[1:48:41] it original plan of God to have 13
[1:48:45] tribes you say oh that's an unlucky
[1:48:49] number
[1:48:50] that was God's
[1:48:52] plan and when they return in
[1:48:56] Ezekiel you will find them yep in
[1:49:00] perfect traval
[1:49:04] order with Dan and eph placed back in
[1:49:08] right so won be here this evening so
[1:49:10] we'll just tell you the story a little
[1:49:13] Dan and eph is finally taken out but
[1:49:16] they're not deleted because the Bible
[1:49:18] says you don't delete them under heaven
[1:49:21] their sin was to go after the golden
[1:49:24] caves that's right their name was
[1:49:26] removed under
[1:49:28] heaven but not in heaven right because
[1:49:31] in Ezekiel they'll come back in perfect
[1:49:33] order right but when they camp in
[1:49:35] perfect order in the
[1:49:37] Millennium it will
[1:49:40] be three three three three leave out in
[1:49:44] the middle and Joseph as being Christ
[1:49:48] right what a story
[1:49:51] want a story of redemption that's right
[1:49:55] so
[1:49:57] perfect you can deal with everything
[1:50:01] amen so perfect to see that God doesn't
[1:50:05] forget his
[1:50:07] Blessing
[1:50:09] right then and Ephraim is removed under
[1:50:11] heaven but the Millennium is heaven on
[1:50:14] Earth right and they're put back
[1:50:19] in
[1:50:22] that's how he deals with that other
[1:50:23] 24,000 we mentioned one
[1:50:26] ago let's year you deal with
[1:50:32] 24,000 yeah but I only know want to know
[1:50:34] about Jesus I thought I made a quote in
[1:50:40] there that there's no Redemption without
[1:50:42] Jesus
[1:50:44] right there's no salvation without
[1:50:48] Jesus no matter where it be Old
[1:50:50] Testament or new that's right he paid
[1:50:52] the
[1:50:57] price what do we need to know about
[1:50:59] Israel that's over
[1:51:03] under just
[1:51:08] remember they're going to be in the
[1:51:10] Millennium the prophecy that's right
[1:51:11] right well you know what with that
[1:51:13] attitude of not wanting to
[1:51:18] understand I better say me to make it
[1:51:20] where it would be without offending you
[1:51:23] I'm not going to be there if I don't
[1:51:26] want the Plan of Redemption because you
[1:51:28] know I plan on being in the Millennium
[1:51:32] amen and to know how they get there I
[1:51:34] find out how I get there that's right to
[1:51:36] know how they're purged I find out how
[1:51:38] I'm purged that's
[1:51:41] right why don't you just throw the Bible
