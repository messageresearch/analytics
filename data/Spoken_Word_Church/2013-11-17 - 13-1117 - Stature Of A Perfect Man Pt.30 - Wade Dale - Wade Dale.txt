TRANSCRIPT
========================================
right and brother Bram said I was going to go and shoot him or do something to him he said but I L him to the Lord and converted him and he's a Christian now so the difference the boy at 12 with no leadership of the Lord right and a man at say 40 years old with the Holy Ghost and coming up the statute of a perfect man look at the difference he said I prayed for his sinful Soul right so you see the difference and that's the same way we are all should be boy a lot of us going to fall off before we get started aren't we see then we wonder why God is not in his church cuz we don't have Temperance huh doing Miracles and things that they you that they used to do yes sir see add these things add Temperance to it oh Temperance how to answer in kindness when wrath is spoke to you now that gets a lot of it mhm somebody say you a bunch of Holy Rollers down there don't jump out and roll up your sleeves see now not that but talk with Godly love Temperance kindness is that the way you want to be turn says amen when you're red upon R not back let him be ex your example in other words Jesus Christ they say if thou be the Son of God turn these stones into bread he could have done it and show he was God but he had Temperance when he called him Bells above he said said I'll forgive you for this that's right they pulled handfuls of beard out of his face and spit in his face and said come down off the cross he said father forgive them they don't even know what they're doing when he had the gift he knowed all things for in him was the fullness of the godhead B they had seen him perform Miracles by telling people what was wrong with him and so forth like that they put a rag around his head around his eyes hit him in the head with a stick said prophesy tell us who hit you we'll believe you see he had Temperance now if you got it like that to your faith if you still blow up in SASS and fuss and stew and carry on uh-huh you ain't got no you can't add that cuz it won't add St it won't vulcanize you couldn't take a piece of rubber and vulcanize it to a piece of iron it just won't work that's got to be flexible just like the rubber is see and when your faith and your Temperance becomes the same kind of Holy Ghost Temperance that he had then it will vulcanize with him you're adding added to it when your virtue is like his virt then you add to it when your knowledge is like his knowledge I come to do thy will oh God see with the father's word he defeated every devil Heaven and Earth will pass away but the word will not see when you got that kind of knowledge it'll vulcanize with your faith you see what he's talking about faith is rubber so all these virtues are rubber but if you're if you don't have faith and you're that rock you know like Ezekiel says you got a Stony heart well a Stony heart in a heart of Flesh you can't vulcanize those together but if you got a heart of Flesh and you got flesh you got Rubber and you got rubber do you know you can vulcanize that rubber together and that's what we used to do with the old Tire Cube I know Danny and brother Joe and some of the older ones remember U Brother Ray brother Bob probably don't he never changed the tire in his life probably call Triple A we called s swd s your way Dale didn't we but you take that tire to you and you put some glue on it but what would you do you heat it you take a torch or even we used to take just an old match heat it with a match cuz that hey bicycles is the only way we had to get around and if we had a flat absolutely and if we had a flat tire that means our ride was gone so we took that tube off we found the hole fill it up put in some water and watch where the bubbles come up take and scratch that thing off real good and you could buy patches they were not paper patches they were not wood patches duct tape they were not duct tape duct tape will hold but it won't hold forever but if you those patches were made out of rubber right the P the the tube was rubber you clean that thing off you'd strike a masch and you'd heat that thing up just about as hot as you can get before it melted slap your a little glue on it when you stuck that patch on you couldn't get it off could you it actually was stronger than the tub around it wasn't it so that's what God's got if if you've got rubberized like brother Brown said vulcanized if you're Rubber and God brings the patch cuz every once in a while we do blow a fuse we blow a hole out of our tube what does God do he says well I got a patch but the patch is not paper and your rubber or he's rubber in your paper it's got to be the holy ghost that you have and you say Okay God I can't handle this on my own he said okay I may heat you up a little bit yeah he may heat you up a little bit CU you know what he's going to test what you got not for his business but for yours Moses brother B said he wanted to know if he had the right man well that's what the prophet said but I think God wanted Moses to know that Moses was the right man right so he could trust in God and that's why you got to doal with these virtues and next Sunday we'll go will still still be on Temperance and we'll start right here be who you are but if you got a change make it a Godly change right that God could work with and it wasn't just his heart part it was his inner being and I believe if David would have been able to be born again he would have been mightier than he was but it's it's it's actually ashamed that he lived the way he lived and we live the way we live and we've got the Holy Ghost and he didn't that's uh that's the way I see it for all the ones in the Old Testament is that we should all be ashamed of Our Lives amen right okay all right let's start with Temperance you got that on okay all right good to have each and every one of you here like I said remember Mom in prayer um she's probably watching in this morning but not feeling good in her body um and just by way of announcements I want to let you know we're going to be gone probably a week and a half after Christmas so uh and we'll also be gone Sunday December the 1st so brother Joe's going to take December the 1st are you going to be gone any the first weekend in January uh the first week you talk about the about the 29th December that whole week you'll be gone y brother Joe 29th of December what is that9 you got to do 29th of December let me use my uh Sharpie Sharpie we'll be here all right and then somebody's going to have to take December the 5th because we're probably not going to be back either D so you going to be going Sunday to Sunday you what are you doing you World Tour or the family okay but you going to be back the next Sunday yeah the 5th the December the 5th no January the 5th January you got January the 4th you're going to be gone this whole week can't to talk to mon yeah the fifth is that next Sunday I have to let get back to you on that brother Joe just be ready no maybe Brother Ray have something to say during that time maybe Ryan would have something to say huh brother R talk about Brother Ray one of those r r or yeah Ray or r one of the two all right let's go fourthly brother Brown talking about we'll have to hurry what we're now is we're on Temperance now we talked about knowledge a little bit last Sunday and spoke a few minutes about Temperance now remember knowledge knowledge remember is not worldly knowledge has nothing to do with how smart you are that's right now it does have something to do with what you can comprehend it does have something to do with what you can comprehend cuz when the Holy Ghost comes he brings the word well you're going to have to put yourself available you can't just say I'm dumb Lord you're just going to have to do everything now come on people that's that's not that's over on the other side I I like to be in the middle uh some people over here in the Stream you you know you got to know your Greek your Hebrew through and you got to know how to recite the Bible backwards that's worldly knowledge Satan has that kind of knowledge he can quote the Bible he was there when it was written he's here now and he he's knows it better than we do but then you take the people over on this side that says well I'm just God said brother R said even the most ignorant person can receive the Holy Ghost well that's exactly the truth but I'll promise you one thing you receive the true Holy Ghost and you put yourself available for the word you'll become smart you'll become smart in the ways of God right and even without the ability to read you know even without the ability to read remember that old man that went fishing with that boy and you know the little boy didn't um he went to the Sunday school class and they said well you can't see God you can't see this you can't see that and he asked his mama and his mama said go ask your daddy and his daddy said go ask somebody you know so he goes out fishing with that old man and he asked the old man he said where's God have you ever seen God he said Son every day I live I see God well now he didn't see him in a textbook he saw him in a revelation of the sun coming up the sun going down nature uh the plants the flowers the trees I was thinking coming from hunting yesterday I thought all these trees come from one place how can you not see a Divine Providence of a of a Creator right that put everything in the earth that we needed because there's nothing new Under the Sun everything we needed he put in this earth in the Book of Genesis this computer was in the Book of Genesis because it comes from plastic which is in the earth nothing comes from above it all comes from down here right everybody understand what I'm talking about so the Providence of God was I'm going remember the Bible says the knowledge of the Lord shall fill the Earth the Sea and the sky everything Earth sea and sky there's nothing left besides that that's all you got the Earth SE and sky and he said his knowledge would fill that up so you don't have to be a rocket scientist and know you know know how that that the U plant photosynthesizes in the summertime and turns it into chloroform and you don't have to know that you just look and say God you resurrected this plant who told that and that's what I was thinking yesterday coming I thought who told that plant who told that plant to take all of its sap and run it down into the roots so that it can survive the winter cuz that's what it is it survives the winter by having its life down here in the roofs now who tells it that well God did he said it before the when he created the world and it hadn't changed since and same way with the animals who who tells the the bird to fly south for the winter time well it gets cold and there's a chemical reaction and this happens in the you know same way with the deer this when the sunlight when the days get shorter the photosynth or the um um eyeballs the cuticles and all that changes in a deer well that causes it to start into its mating season because of the shortening of the days it has nothing to do with anything else it's just that the daylight sun in that deer's eyes changes the chemical reaction in its body and it becomes able to reproduce now you don't have to understand every little aspect but you can just look and say God you did all this he's the master architect so that's why I say about knowledge we don't have to have worldly knowledge as far as will you say well you're smart and I'm dumb if you both got the Holy Ghost it's not a dumb Holy Ghost and a smart Holy Ghost everybody understand what I'm saying and I don't believe the Lord is bothered with saying that because he puts it in you and you know what he does he uses that character just like this tree is a pine and this one is an oak and this one is a popular and this in his an Elm he uses you and and brother CLA brought that out the other day he said be who you are CU sometimes you say well I wish I could be quiet well God didn't want me quiet sure there's things we got to overcome in the Statue of a perfect man but there's no way I could be like sister barbar no I would burst my eyeballs would fall out I mean it just but see that's a characteristic that sometimes I wished I had cuz the Bible says Be Still every time I see her I kind of think in my mind be still and know that I am God cuz she's she's real meticulous in her movement and you know some of us are just hky jerky and run all over the place and poor brother Jim pinking out in wit he just a mess and he knows it so I'm not saying anything he doesn't know he's a when you eat around him you're in a splatter Zone when he talks you if you're sitting across from him no one thinks for sure you're going to be eating what he's eating but see that's just the way he is he likes to talk and he shovels his food and he just talks and he just he goes everywhere but that's a trait what I'm saying is that's a characteristic that that the statue of a perfect man is not going to take out of him that's not going to he's not going to One Day become so humble that he doesn't that's not it try not what I'm trying to say is is try not to so much say well God I'm I'm just a big mouth and I need to change well yeah you need to maybe have a little patience and all that watch what you're saying watch what you're doing but God wants your character or he wouldn't have put you here with that genetic trait black people sings very well I love the way they sing and the way they worship God loves that that's why he put it in you to do that you know us us white people we can't when we're doing this you're supposed to be doing that you know you just be way off beat and then black people they just you know and you know what they do though if you would have took that if you would have took that and used it for the glory of the Lord you wouldn't have all these rappers and all that stuff out here that's just that's just degrading the nation with their junk the black people and the white people but take the take the desire that God give that group of people you understand what I'm saying take that desire that's what we're talking about the statute of perfect man you don't have to say well I'm going to pick one of these virtues and then I'm going to really excel in that virtue now God wants you to be well balanced in the virtues but some of you are going to have I don't believe sister Bara would get mad if you went over there and just slapped her right in the face she wouldn't get mad now well she said she might let me put it this way there would be a different reaction if I slapped her than I slapped Susan now that's a contrast praise the Lord anyhow brother you know it brother now do you see what I mean yeah I believe they're both Christian women you understand what I'm saying I know better though than to slap Su if I had my pick I'd slap just Barber but I'm not going to slap either one of them but you understand what I'm saying you see why this character that we're building and I kind of want to take a few minutes today we're on number three 1 2 3 and we're I don't want us to become um zombies right I don't we need to live our life the way God intended now look there's things that come in that we don't need to have you understand that because the devil's right there but when what brother Dale is preaching now you we got to realize that just weaves right into the statue of a perfect man cuz they receive the Seal of God in their forehead not exactly the knowledge but do you know every one of these virtues comes right through here you don't get virtue from your hand The Virtue that you have flows through that hand to either shake it or like you said you know punch somebody or shake their hand right but where does that come from that emulates from the inside person but you got to get it right here first where does knowledge come from right here where does temperance come from right here because your whole psyche is in your is in your mental capacity of thinking that's why I don't want us to be message zombies or Christian zombies where we have to be monks if you do that I promise you one thing you will fail right it will drive you crazy right and you will be a basket case but you know what I like Susan being outgoing cuz I'm outgoing and it's not that I don't like sister Barber but I can't carry on conversation with sister Barber cuz she just goes and then if she speaks I have to be right up close to her to hear her cuz she you you understand what I'm saying yeah so let's don't take our and and totally God wants to take care of our character but he put a certain trait in you you put a certain trait in you that he wants to use now there's the thing you can use it for his honor and Glory or you can use it to destroy your character and other right brother said if you destroy the man's influence you destroyed the man or if you killed the man's influence so that means if you stay what we're trying to do with this statute of a perfect man I just want to kind of like I said we're up number three to knowledge now we're going into Temperance I want us to realize don't fight the thing now brother BR said you'll fight your nature brother Bram said you'll be sticky and that's true cuz Satan is right there ready to give back to you what you give to him so there is a Bible greatest battle ever Fs in the mind right right here so what you filter through today I don't want you from from the time now all the way up through even to Godliness when we're up to Godliness sure we're supposed to act like God and we're supposed to be Christians and people are supposed to realize that we are different but realize one thing black people are always going to be black white people always going to be white you're going to have that trait of singing and and worship stay with that stay with that remember what brother rown said he talked about Martin Luther King and and the white people he said you need to Martin Luther King needs to leave the people alone he said the black people are even he didn't say smarter he said but they educate their people better cuz you have a culture there that you you want to filter that culture down there's nothing wrong with it if you use it right so brother randam was against he he wasn't a segregation but he wanted them to keep separate that's right right he he never wanted he said you integr he said you're going to cause a war and it did you know it caused a battle there in the 60s but you understand what I'm saying don't fight who you are in the terms of God you made me like this you know what a housewife with the Holy Ghost is just as important as a preacher cuz what she does with those children nurturing those children is a foundation to get that child of Christianity and oh how we wish we had went over time to go over we would have done it different because we weren't born again when our children were coming up but see you know what that wasn't a surprise to God either but now we live the life that we hope that we can let the children see us and then want to become like us um that's why I saying about now we come into Temperance husband and wife going to have arguments children are going to hear it but you know what it's what happens afterwards it's what happens afterwards show affection do the things you're supposed to do as Christians there are basic foundational things that we're supposed to do supposed to love our wife supp to love our wife and comfort her right and you know what Jesus said he'd be a comforter to the Widow so we got all that everything's covered but you got to believe that we' got to believe that whatever we want to get rid of remember I was talking about doors indoors brother said God you let God in in the inner part of your soul right but there's still doors in your house that you keep closed and the doorknobs on your side still the Holy Ghost will absolutely stand there and not go anywhere if you don't L he's a gentleman my brother Brown said I go back to that but brother Brown didn't didn't just say that for for for filling up tape he said the Holy Ghost is timid so it's got a nature the Holy Ghost has got a nature itself that's the Holy Ghost nature but now he's not going to take that and just pour it out if you don't want it right we're back to free moral agency there's no I was reading quotes yesterday brother brand right up to his 1965 he never did away with free moral agency even after you're born again you are a free moral agent you can do whatever you want to do and the Holy Ghost will go remember how he made the illustration how the Holy Ghost would go back to the father now of course illustration we don't believe in three Gods but the Holy Ghost Jesus Jesus Christ in the form of the Holy Ghost or God whichever one you want to say in the form of the Holy Ghost comes into you at the new birth right burns out the old nature puts his nature in and you beg you become your you begin your journey as a Christian right but at that time you can say don't know I just that door right there I don't want to be messing with that room in my house and you know what God will say okay but you'll never get the promises that are affiliated with that that's the problem you won't get the promises that are affiliated brother brother Dale he come to a place to where we believe that that that God's used a man um I believe he's a a manifested Son of God I believe he he's he lives what he preaches and he preached what he lives there's no question about that right all right so see that standard to me you don't have to say well I got to be like brother Dale you can't do that right if anybody can I'm the closest cuz I got his genetic makeup me and Terence and Anna we be close we be close we be close we are close we I'm talking like you now but we're we're the closest to it because we're genetically made up like the man personally but you know what Terence and I and Anna could be just as rotten as rotten could be without the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost we're rotten as we can be I don't care who you are Billy Paul Joseph Brandon family I don't care who it is I was reading yesterday brother brand said this is an individual Affair he said I don't care if your mother and father were the most Saed people in the world in the world he said he said you have got to make a choice all right so and see that's why we don't want to lean on you say well my Mom and Daddy was drunk or my mom and daddy were divorced or my mom so sure there's things that you carry like I said there's traits that you carry but let's try to use that for the glory of God all right try to use that for God and and then ask God to help you and I believe you will asking you shall receive seeking you shall find knocking it shall be open okay cut your hand up yeah well the we all go through different trials different Temptations so we go we grow differently that's correct and the other thing is ear on on the intelligence we read a quot from Brother Dale whatever the devil uses to catch you the same way that's correct same prop God will use contact that's right and is on that Maniac that not Maniac the guy in Oregon who wanted to be the guy oh yeah the big guy yeah couldn't be delivered because want cuz he liked it he he wanted that now brother BR cast it out but it came back brother Bram cast that demon out of that man remember the man that was going to kill brother brand come up to him was going to kill him he said he knew he could he cast The Demon out of him but if you'll look about two or three messages later he's referring back to it and and somebody must have asked him well did the guy get rid of it he said no he liked that spirit so it came back on it that's the same way with healing brother Brown say you get healed of cancer the cancer dies what about a man that could sit there and tell you what goes on inside your body with a seventh grade education but what did he do he used God's instrument of the word and the knowledge of God give him to say hey that cancer is a life and when it dies you still got the flesh there that flesh is going to ride you're going to get sicker he said if you don't continue believing he said that spirit will come back into that now if you want to read that in the scripture it's in Matthew where it says the unclean Spirit goes out of a man we we use as a new birth but you need to also use that as other things even this unclean Spirit goes out of a man W in dry places seeketh rest find us none comes back finds it swept and garnished in other words finds it cleaned out but if you don't let God in and get Godly Temperance Satan's going to bring that old temper right back seven times worse that's just the way it is and you're already filled with the Holy Ghost but we're not completely sealed in our forehead that's what's been going on that's why people have been dying when you get sealed in your forehead when you come to where that love that Capstone comes down so you got to be ready for it to come down on we're not going up to it Christ is coming down here right he's coming to get us and we're going to connect and we're going with him but he's got to come down here right brother Brown said the Capstone comes down all right so we we got to be ready down here when what I'm saying is we can't be ready in the Millennium right you got to be ready down here and the capstone's not going to fall on an individual that can't handle these virtues can I say one more sure you reminded said something tap that I do know how the rupture would be I was wondering how is this rupture going to be it's like a magnet big Holy Ghost if you have your holy GH if you do magneti that's right go up so you have to have it you have to have it that's correct and if you can't attain to all those virtues that's why people are dying and going by the grave that's why brother Del saw that I can say it just just plan his day we had a brother di yesterday brother Sammy kenzer just remember his family he's 59 years old he was a pastor of the church in North Carolina I think Virginia and 59 years old went hunting with his grandkids fell over theread with a heart attack in woods so you never know that's right but God sees you come to a place and that's as far as you're going to go if you're a Christian best thing he can do is take you off the scene right won't be good for the family but we got to remember as Christians when God's finished with our work on Earth we don't want to be here anymore go back to to Hezekiah prayed for 15 more years watch brother brandham remember brother brandham with that we talked about the other day that sister Smith and he thought it was sister so and so shepher and Smith he got him mixed up and he went to praying for this one and this one died well see if he would have interceded for this one God knew if he would have interceded for this one he'd had to let that woman live that's how powerful that prophet's prayer was cuz the Bible said I mean the the angel said nothing will stand before you nothing not even cancer we'll stand before that man but you know what he came to a place though to where he had to be adopted he had to have the headstone message come which was the opening of the seventh seal which showed Redemption of this body so that's what we're trying to do we're trying to get to the Redemption of this body so we've come to a place to where now forly I just want to kind of give you that I want you to think about it I want you to you know chew it up digest it that don't try to make yourself change brother talks about it before this he says don't be a peacock I mean don't be a blackbird and start sticking peacock feathers in you somewhere along the line those feathers are going to fall out but you know it's like brother Claud said Sunday you know where you're at with God you're the only one that knows where you're at with God and brother Brown said you can know who you where you're at with God at any time what look into the the mirror look in the mirror that's right take the genetic code of the Holy Ghost this is genetic code of the Holy Ghost not all the David killed this one and had his best friend killed not that but take the life of Jesus Christ I know we all fall short of that but still we got to strive for it that's our goal if Christ is here he said he would make you live the life he Liv if you got the Holy Ghost and if you open yourself up to it make yourself available for the word god honored brother Brown said he's honor bound to keep his word all right so just for about five minutes let's talk about Temperance said fourthly we'll have to hurry because I'm just feel so good to stand here and talk about it Amen brother says we're enjoying it thank you add Temperance oh my we've come to Temperance now you've got faith first have to have that to begin with then you add virtue to your faith if it's the right kind of virtue do you hear that if it's the right kind of virtue then you add knowledge if it's the right kind of knowledge now you're going to add Temperance Temperance doesn't mean stop drinking alcohol cuz you should have done that at at Faith at the new birth all right that's what um brother Buster across the road here he said he said I really enjoyed that he said you got he said them Ain things those are things that the virtues are not things that a sinner is supposed to get rid of you should have got rid of the smoking the drinking the the the cussing the running around and all that when you've got the new birth actually if you want to be real honest about it in sanctification all that's supposed to go out the new birth just comes in and confirms that it is gone right so that kind of helped him and it should help all of us to see that that's that we're not trying to convert Christians up the statue of a perfect man we're not converting Christians up the statue of a perf man you understand what I'm saying we're getting Christians we're getting Sinners converted and then getting the Christians up the statue of a perfect man right all right so I like that that's a good quote Temperance doesn't mean stop drinking alcohol here either no no Temperance doesn't mean alcoholic cure not in this case this is Bible Temperance Holy Spirit Temperance that's just one of the lust of the flesh but we're talking about Holy Spirit Temperance that means how to control your tongue not be a toddler how to control your temper not fly off every time anybody speaks cross to you oh my boy a lot of us going to fall off before we get started aren't we see he must know that's a tough one cuz you know what you remember him he was Irish he said my mouth stayed busted the whole time I was a little kid he was going to kill those people those boys if God hadn't intervene at 22 he would have killed him cuz he was a crack shot and he was going to kill him cuz he pulled the trigger right everybody said oh well he no he pulled the trigger if you going to go kill somebody and you pull a trigger you going to expect something to go out the end of that barrel and it ain't going to be nice but God stopped every one of those bullets from going off remember he emptied the whole gun click click click and then he put them back in there and when they were all gone and when he got settled down and they just that wasn't coincidence that was God protect ing the gift that the man had right but it wasn't at that point he was not born again and he was mad he wasn't mad he was highly angry and murderous somebody say amen he was going to murder them boy I was God revealing himself kill him as well sure absolutely oh when he got finished he thought how low would you feel if you were 12 years old you had your gun and you were going to go kill somebody and you went click click click click and he was a crack shot people I mean he could shoot squirrels in the eyeball so he wasn't going to miss he didn't go out there to miss he went out there to kill them boys met him on the road remember he say he said I had intent to shoot them boy they killed his dog they killed his dog right yeah right but you know what if he' had a new birth he'd have done just what he said he'd do he'd pray for him he'd pray now will you remember the remember the uh the old man that done he was some kind of an owner of a business and he he poisoned one of his dogs
