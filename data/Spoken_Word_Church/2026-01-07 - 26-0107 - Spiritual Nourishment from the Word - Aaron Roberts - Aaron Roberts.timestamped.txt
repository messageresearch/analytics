[2:41] Amen. for the ride.
[4:02] There's a grace when the heart is under
[4:04] fire.
[4:09] Another way when the walls are closing
[4:12] in.
[4:16] And when I look at the space between
[4:19] where I used to be and this reckoning,
[4:24] I know I will never be alone.
[4:28] There was another in the fire
[4:33] standing next to me.
[4:36] There was another in the waters
[4:40] holding back the seas. Should I ever
[4:45] need reminding
[4:47] of how I've been set free,
[4:51] there is a cross that bears the burden
[4:55] where another died for me.
[4:58] There is another in the fire.
[5:17] On my death left for death beneath the
[5:20] waterers,
[5:24] I'm no longer a sled to my sin anymore.
[5:32] And should I fall in the space between
[5:35] what remains of me and this reckoning,
[5:40] either way, I won't bow to the things of
[5:43] this world.
[5:47] And I know I will never be alone.
[5:52] There is another in the fire
[5:57] standing next to me.
[6:00] There is another in the waters
[6:04] holding back the seas.
[6:08] And should I ever need reminding
[6:12] what power set me free,
[6:15] there is a grave that holds nobody.
[6:19] And another power lives in me.
[6:23] There is another in the fire.
[6:28] Oh,
[6:31] there is another in the fire.
[6:36] Oh,
[6:39] there is another in the fire.
[6:44] Oh,
[6:47] there is another in the fire.
[6:51] Oh,
[6:56] I can see the light in the darkness as
[7:00] the darkness bounced to him. I can hear
[7:04] the roar in the heavens as the space
[7:09] between brein. I could feel the ground
[7:14] shake beneath us as a prison wall cave
[7:18] in. Nothing stands between us.
[7:24] Nothing stands between us.
[7:29] There is no name but the name that is
[7:33] Jesus.
[7:37] He who was and still is and will be
[7:40] through it all.
[7:45] So come what may in the space between
[7:48] all the things unseen in this reckoning.
[7:53] I know I will never be alone.
[8:01] I know I will never be alone.
[8:06] There'll be another in the fire
[8:10] standing next to me.
[8:14] There'll be another in the waters
[8:18] holding back the seas.
[8:22] Should I ever need reminding
[8:26] how good you been to me,
[8:30] I'll count the joy from every battle.
[8:34] cuz I know that's where you'll be.
[8:39] I can see the light in the darkness as a
[8:44] darkness bows to him. I can hear the
[8:48] roar in the heavens as the space between
[8:54] where it's thin. I can feel the ground
[8:57] shake beneath us as a prison walls cave
[9:02] in. Nothing stands between us.
[9:07] Nothing stands between us.
[9:40] Hallelujah.
[9:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. The fourth man in the fire.
[9:46] &gt;&gt; I tell you, I think you could preach a
[9:48] whole series on that.
[9:50] &gt;&gt; And um
[9:52] I've said before, when you think you're
[9:54] alone, you're not alone.
[9:56] &gt;&gt; He's here. He's with you. The one that's
[9:58] in the fire with you is the one that
[10:00] made the fire.
[10:01] &gt;&gt; In the scriptures, they couldn't even
[10:02] smell the smoke. I coined the term, he's
[10:05] the god of the periodic table. He
[10:07] understands every level of every element
[10:10] that we're going through. And there's a
[10:11] different kind of fire we're in. It's a
[10:14] refining fire, right? It's getting us
[10:16] ready for our body change. And he's
[10:18] there with us. Amen. He's in us. Amen.
[10:20] Let's all stand this evening and uh just
[10:24] turn to your neighbor, shake each
[10:25] other's hand, greet him in the name of
[10:27] the Lord. So thankful for his presence
[10:29] here. Um
[10:32] Amen.
[10:34] He's the word and uh we just come
[10:38] expecting and just pull on that gift,
[10:40] pull on that word for your need this
[10:42] afternoon. And as we sing word of God
[10:45] ever true, as uh brother Aaron come, you
[10:48] know, I I realize that you get out of
[10:51] the service what you put into it.
[10:54] &gt;&gt; And uh if you prepare your heart to just
[10:56] come and expect um it doesn't have to be
[10:59] a lot of emotion. It's just that pull
[11:02] that that hunger. Stay thirsty. Always
[11:05] stay thirsty for the word of God.
[11:08] Um because it's what changes us from
[11:12] this dimension to that dimension. And um
[11:16] it's the unseen. And you know, we had a
[11:18] prophet to always point us look to the
[11:20] unseen. Look at that one, that fourth
[11:23] man. Look at the son of man. He's here
[11:26] to reveal himself. And that same one
[11:28] back there is still here. What an
[11:29] eternal presence it is. And we're
[11:32] thankful that holy words
[11:36] long preserved
[11:39] for our walk
[11:41] in this world.
[11:44] They resound
[11:46] with God's own heart. Oh, let the word
[11:51] of God impart
[11:54] and words of life. It's words of hope.
[11:59] It gives us strength. It helps us cope.
[12:04] In this world, wherever we roam, the
[12:10] word of God will guide us home. Oh word
[12:15] of God,
[12:17] ever true.
[12:20] Change in me,
[12:22] change in you.
[12:25] We have come with open hearts. Oh, let
[12:30] the word of God impart
[12:34] and holy words
[12:37] of our faith. They're handed down
[12:42] to this age
[12:45] came to us through sacrifice.
[12:49] Oh, heed the faithful words of Christ
[12:54] and holy words
[12:57] long preserved
[13:00] for our walk in this world
[13:07] with God's own heart. Oh, let the word
[13:11] of God impart
[13:14] and word of God
[13:17] ever true is changing me is changing
[13:23] you.
[13:24] We have come with open hearts. Oh, let
[13:30] the word of God
[13:32] impart.

[13:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Y'all be seated
[13:46] for a minute.
[13:49] Good to be in the house of the Lord
[13:50] again.
[13:52] &gt;&gt; And
[13:54] Lord willing after tonight, y'all get a
[13:56] break from me. Praise the Lord.
[13:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. We appreciate all our all of our
[14:02] help and
[14:03] &gt;&gt; and uh we appreciate just our being able
[14:06] to do our part and uh
[14:10] whatever whatever we can do and uh so um
[14:15] give me the key of C.
[14:21] As I travel through this land, there are
[14:25] trials on every hand. And without an
[14:29] anchor, I'd be shipwrecked on the sands.
[14:34] But I have a guide, an absolute on which
[14:38] I stand. I've been changed by grace into
[14:43] a brand new man.
[14:47] Yes, I've been changed by grace into a
[14:51] brand new man. The old man had to die
[14:56] when I was born again.
[15:01] Well, something made over just would not
[15:06] do. And I've been changed by grace into
[15:10] someone brand new.
[15:14] Well, the age I was living in was
[15:18] wretched, naked, and blind. But then on
[15:22] my soul, Lord, you let your light shine.
[15:26] The creature that I was
[15:30] no longer stand. And I've been changed
[15:34] by grace into a brand new man.
[15:39] Oh, I've been changed by grace into a
[15:43] brand new man. The old man had to die
[15:49] when I was born again.
[15:53] Well, something made over just would not
[15:58] do. I've been changed by grace into
[16:03] someone brand new.
[16:06] Yes, I've been changed by grace into a
[16:10] brand new man. The old man had to die
[16:16] when I was born again.
[16:20] Well, something made over just would not
[16:25] do. And I've been changed by grace into
[16:30] someone brand new.
[16:35] Amen.
[16:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. We've been changed.
[16:42] &gt;&gt; Changed from the old man.
[16:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Into someone in the image of God.
[16:49] Amen. By the word, he's changed us.
[16:52] Amen. Praise God. If you have your
[16:54] Bibles tonight, let's all stand and uh
[16:57] look into the scripture. We're going to
[16:58] read from two places. Psalms 103 and
[17:01] then Matthew chapter 4.
[17:06] And uh
[17:10] this is the
[17:14] just trying to find the right thing to
[17:17] say tonight and you know this being the
[17:21] like the first service of the year new
[17:23] year for us and just trying to come you
[17:27] know what would the Lord have us say
[17:28] tonight
[17:30] &gt;&gt; and looking forward to a new year and
[17:34] lots of opportunities, possibilities,
[17:38] and blessings and and you know, we know
[17:40] we're going to face battles and but
[17:42] thank God he's he's leading us, leading
[17:44] the way, and that
[17:46] &gt;&gt; he's in charge. And
[17:48] &gt;&gt; praise God that uh you know, we've been
[17:50] given the armor of God to
[17:52] &gt;&gt; to lead us. And uh tonight on I want to
[17:56] speak on uh
[18:00] spiritual nourishment from the word.
[18:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. and uh we're going to start here
[18:05] in in Psalms 103 beginning at verse one.
[18:08] And uh look at look at a few things and
[18:12] we may not get done with it tonight, but
[18:14] uh you know the word of God is full and
[18:18] it's rich and a lot of good things there
[18:21] and it's eternal. So you can't you can't
[18:24] exhaust it.
[18:25] &gt;&gt; So before we read the scripture tonight,
[18:27] let's just uh speak to the author.
[18:30] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we thank
[18:32] you, Lord, that we're able to gather in
[18:34] your house tonight. Lord, we're just
[18:36] able to look into your word, Lord, by
[18:38] your your help, Lord, your mercy and
[18:40] grace to us. And Lord, we just pray that
[18:42] Lord, you have your will and way with us
[18:44] tonight. And Lord, just speak to our
[18:45] hearts, Lord, as we look into your word.
[18:48] And Lord, each one that's here tonight,
[18:51] Lord Jesus, you know what what our
[18:52] hearts desires are, Lord Jesus, what our
[18:55] needs are. those that are watching in
[18:56] tonight, Lord Jesus. Lord, we just pray
[18:59] that you be with them and Lord, just
[19:00] touch each one and Lord, we just commit
[19:03] all things to you in the name of Jesus
[19:05] Christ we pray. Amen.
[19:08] &gt;&gt; Psalms 103, beginning at verse one. It
[19:11] says, "Bless the Lord, oh my soul,
[19:15] and all that is within me, bless his
[19:17] holy name. Bless the Lord, oh my soul,
[19:19] and forget not all his benefits. Who
[19:21] forgiveth all thine iniquities, who
[19:23] health all thy diseases, who redeemth
[19:25] thy life
[19:28] &gt;&gt; from destruction, who crowneth thee with
[19:30] loving kindness and tender mercies, who
[19:32] satisfyth thy mouth with good things, so
[19:35] that thy youth is renewed like the
[19:38] eagles. Amen. So that's what we are in
[19:41] this in this end time. We are eagles.
[19:44] We're God's eagles.
[19:46] And the word satisfies us and renews our
[19:49] our strength and our youth like the
[19:52] eagle.
[19:53] In Matthew 4 beginning at verse three,
[19:57] chapter of Matthew 4 beginning at verse
[19:59] three and it says, "And when the tempter
[20:01] came to him, he said, if thou be the son
[20:04] of God, command that these stones be
[20:06] made bread. And he answered and said, it
[20:09] is written, man shall not live by bread
[20:11] alone, but by every word that proceedth
[20:13] out of the mouth of God." Amen. And you
[20:15] may be seated tonight.
[20:17] And you know there's many scriptures
[20:20] that you can look at uh to to start with
[20:24] from here and just trying to come up
[20:28] with a
[20:30] just find the mind of God.
[20:33] But I want to read a a a few quotes here
[20:38] starting out and um this is from the
[20:41] from the message Abraham
[20:43] and brother Brandham's speaking here and
[20:45] he's speaking of El Shadai
[20:47] and he talks about he said that El
[20:49] Shadai means the the the breast the the
[20:52] bosom of a woman. He said El Shadai the
[20:55] almighty the strength giver the
[20:58] nourisher. He said like the mother to
[21:00] the baby. said when a little baby is
[21:03] fretting and sick, the mother pulls it
[21:04] up to her and bosom and it nurses her
[21:07] strength and her life into it. And he
[21:10] said another thing it does, it means a
[21:12] satisfier. So when a baby is not is is
[21:16] fredding or whatever,
[21:18] then it can nurse from the mother.
[21:21] &gt;&gt; He said it's satisfied while it's a
[21:23] nursing. He said it ain't well yet, but
[21:26] it's satisfied as long as it's drawing
[21:28] from the mother. And God is El Shadai,
[21:30] the bosom. He said not one breast, two
[21:32] breasts. He said God is our strength for
[21:35] spiritual. He is our strength for our
[21:37] physical. And he said no matter which
[21:39] one you need of it. He said move up to
[21:41] the breast and take a hold of it God's
[21:43] word and go to nursing from it. You'll
[21:46] come back to health and strength. The
[21:48] strength of the Holy Ghost lies in God's
[21:50] promises. He said take up there one time
[21:53] and take a hold.
[21:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:56] And so another time, brother Brandham is
[21:57] speaking in Abraham's covenant confirmed
[22:00] and he's speaking of of El Shadai being
[22:03] the breasted one. And he said, "See you
[22:05] you nourish." He said, "Lan on his
[22:07] breast and nourish your spiritual
[22:08] strength out of his word." Here's his
[22:10] breast. He said, "Both old and new
[22:12] testament." He said, "Set down." He's
[22:14] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[22:16] The same milk. It comes from one
[22:18] mother's breast is from the other one
[22:20] just exactly. And he said, he said,
[22:23] "It's just two different phases of He
[22:25] said he was wounded. He said, "If you're
[22:27] sick," he said, "Why don't you just hold
[22:29] on to his breast of promise?" He said,
[22:30] "I was wounded for your transgression.
[22:33] With my stripes, you were healed." He
[22:35] said, "What do you have need of tonight?
[22:36] Just lean upon his breast." And another
[22:38] thing, he said, "Did you know El Shadai
[22:40] means the strong one."
[22:42] &gt;&gt; He said, "Elshai, the sufficient one,
[22:45] the lifegiver, the almighty strong one."
[22:47] Abraham, he said, "You're a hundred
[22:49] years old, old and weak." He said, "But
[22:51] I am your strength."
[22:53] And so we see here that speaking of all
[22:56] that we have need of lays in him and and
[22:59] brother Brennham in the message oneness
[23:02] he's speaking of El Shada and he's
[23:05] speaking he said and he said that we
[23:07] would just ho that he would just hover
[23:09] over us and nourish us and give us today
[23:12] our daily bread both physically and
[23:14] spiritually that we might have the
[23:15] sustaining strength
[23:18] of body to walk about upon the earth and
[23:21] the sustaining power of the Holy Spirit
[23:22] to bring the word of God to a hungry
[23:25] people and to leave here with it upon
[23:27] our lips and in our hearts with such
[23:29] fresh anointing oil that we'd be able to
[23:32] tell others of the day that we are
[23:34] living and the condition of time. He
[23:36] said God we are fully trusting in you.
[23:38] He said there is no other place left no
[23:41] one could go to.
[23:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:43] &gt;&gt; So when we look here brother brother
[23:45] brother Rand was talking about if
[23:46] there's one that we can go to is God.
[23:48] He's he's the allsufficient one. He's El
[23:50] Shadai. So whatever you have need of, he
[23:53] is the one that you can draw all your
[23:54] strength from. Whatever you have need
[23:56] of, it lays in the word of God. You can
[23:58] draw all that you have need of is in
[24:00] laying inside God and inside the word.
[24:02] And all you got to do is draw from it.
[24:05] &gt;&gt; And he is he's the allsufficient one,
[24:07] but he's also our nourisher. He's our
[24:09] lifegiver. He's he's a source of
[24:11] everything that we have need of. All you
[24:12] got to do is draw from it. and to and
[24:15] and I was I was reading online and I and
[24:19] I don't you know AI or one of those
[24:21] internet scholars or whoever it was that
[24:23] that wrote this and and I just I just
[24:25] took it down because it it kind of
[24:28] explains everything but you know
[24:30] somebody talking about nourishing and it
[24:33] says to nourish someone means to provide
[24:35] whatever is needed for their growth,
[24:38] health and well-being which goes beyond
[24:41] just physical food to include emotional,
[24:43] mental and spiritual support through
[24:45] encouragement, care, and fostering their
[24:47] development. It involves sustaining
[24:50] life, fostering dreams, strengthening
[24:52] beliefs, and building up a person or
[24:54] relationship so they can strive, thrive,
[24:57] and reach their potential.
[24:59] &gt;&gt; So, if you're looking at he he's being
[25:02] our nourisher that we can come to God
[25:04] and get everything that we have need of,
[25:05] well, he he is the one that touches
[25:07] every aspect of our life. Every facet of
[25:09] our life is touched by God. And he's the
[25:11] one that you can draw from to receive
[25:13] everything that you have need of. And
[25:14] that's what he wants us to do is receive
[25:17] everything that we have need of from
[25:18] him. And all we got to do is go because
[25:20] he's there to give it to you. He's ready
[25:22] to supply it to you. All you got to do
[25:24] is reach out and take a hold of it.
[25:27] &gt;&gt; And you know, just like brother Brandham
[25:28] said, you know, when a when a baby is
[25:31] crying out or whatever, he said God has
[25:33] provided a way. He said, all you got to
[25:35] do is cry out. And he said, "God will
[25:37] answer just like a mother will come take
[25:39] the baby and give it what it has need
[25:41] of." He said, "Well, if you just cry out
[25:43] to God, he'll do the same thing." He is
[25:45] waiting for you to cry out. But the
[25:46] problem is is we DON'T CRY OUT TO GOD.
[25:50] &gt;&gt; But he's here tonight to speak to each
[25:52] one of us to give us exactly what we
[25:54] have need of. And all you have to do is
[25:55] tap in to that eternal life flow and get
[25:59] everything that you have need of.
[26:00] &gt;&gt; That's right. Just draw from it from
[26:03] that brother saying THAT INEXHAUSTIBLE
[26:05] fountain of life IS HERE. ALL YOU GOT TO
[26:07] do is draw from it.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; See this is what God wants us to have is
[26:13] this eternal. And so we want to draw all
[26:15] of our spiritual nourishment from the
[26:18] word of God. And as as Jesus told the
[26:21] devil that day, he said, "Man shall not
[26:23] live by bread alone." He said, "But by
[26:24] every word that proceedth out of the
[26:26] mouth of God." So when we go to get what
[26:29] God has, we want to take every word of
[26:31] God. We want TO TAKE EVERY JOT AND EVERY
[26:33] TITLE. We don't want to leave one thing
[26:34] behind. I want everything that God has
[26:36] because I don't want to be left behind
[26:38] by one little bit. BECAUSE IF I WANT TO
[26:40] BE SUSTAINED by God, if I want to be
[26:42] nourished by God, if I want to be
[26:44] strengthened by God, then you know what?
[26:45] It takes all of it.
[26:47] &gt;&gt; It takes everything that God has. You
[26:48] can't leave one thing behind. You got to
[26:50] take it all. Right?
[26:53] &gt;&gt; Because the problem is is we live in a
[26:55] day and an hour which everybody likes to
[26:57] pick and choose. And you see the kind of
[26:59] condition that the world is in today.
[27:00] And then we what is because the kind of
[27:04] condition that the world is in today is
[27:06] producing the condition that people are
[27:08] in today.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; And from the from the message this is
[27:12] from the message at thy word 1951.
[27:14] Brother Brandham speaking and he was
[27:16] talking about uh being in you know in
[27:18] the meetings. He said I was very thin
[27:20] then and he said a lady came to help me
[27:23] and she brought him so said brother
[27:24] Brandham take these
[27:27] and she so she gave him something and he
[27:29] said he had a doctor friend there who
[27:30] was saw saw what he had and he took them
[27:32] and he looked at him and he was like
[27:34] well you know he said I don't like to
[27:35] take medicine he said brother Brandham
[27:37] he said these are this is not medicine
[27:38] he said these are vitamins
[27:41] &gt;&gt; and he said he said you need to take
[27:43] these and he said he said anything
[27:45] that'll help you he said I'm all for
[27:46] that that's right that's mercy He said
[27:48] he said I don't ris disregard it as a
[27:51] medicine. It was a medicine anyhow.
[27:55] &gt;&gt; So he wasn't brother Brandon was not was
[27:57] not not somebody that liked to take
[27:59] medicine. But the the doctor was telling
[28:01] he said but brother Brandon he said he
[28:02] said our land has become so poor.
[28:06] &gt;&gt; He said all the vitamins pulled out till
[28:08] it's artificially fertilized and things
[28:10] to when we eat we don't get the right
[28:12] amount of vitamin no matter how much we
[28:15] eat. He said, "It's just bulk." And he
[28:18] said, "We don't get the vitamins and
[28:20] everything and everyone should take
[28:22] those vitamins."
[28:25] &gt;&gt; He said, "See, the grounds wore out." He
[28:27] said, "Everything, it's just the end,
[28:29] isn't it?" He said, "That's right." He
[28:30] said, "Just then, that's it." He said,
[28:32] "It looks like the whole world's a
[28:33] reeling in home." So, because of the
[28:36] earth and the condition that it's in
[28:38] physically, people are dying. People are
[28:41] falling apart. Why? Because there's no
[28:43] nourishment in the earth. because it's
[28:45] all been wore out. It's all been messed
[28:48] up because you know man has to get in
[28:51] put his hands in everything that God has
[28:54] &gt;&gt; because they have to interject
[28:55] themselves into God's laboratory into
[28:58] God's program and all they've done is
[29:00] destroy themselves and they destroy
[29:02] everything else because you know they
[29:03] they can't because it's the intelligence
[29:05] of a man because they have to eat from
[29:08] the tree not from the tree of life but
[29:10] they're eating from the tree of
[29:11] knowledge of good and evil. And the
[29:13] problem is is all it does is produce
[29:15] death. It produced death in the garden
[29:17] and it produces death today.
[29:20] &gt;&gt; So we're seeing this same thing that
[29:22] takes place. They're eating these things
[29:24] and physically people are dying because
[29:26] you there's no nourishment in it.
[29:32] &gt;&gt; And thank God for medicine and thank God
[29:34] for medical science and everything. But
[29:36] you know even even medical science has
[29:37] its limitations.
[29:39] &gt;&gt; Yes. And you know, you realize all these
[29:42] things that they try to give you, you
[29:43] have to watch these things because
[29:45] sometimes they're not out for your best
[29:46] interest
[29:50] &gt;&gt; because all they do is go to the book
[29:51] and they and you know the you know the
[29:54] American Medical Association or
[29:56] whatever, you know, whoever they go to,
[29:58] you know, it's like, hey, well, you know
[29:59] what? If you have these symptoms, we
[30:01] give you this, right?
[30:03] &gt;&gt; And if you have these symptoms, we give
[30:04] you this.
[30:07] And the problem is is well
[30:10] I'm I'm I'm just I'm just kind of old
[30:12] school. But the problem is is you know
[30:14] back years ago when the Indians were
[30:16] here and they were on the on the earth
[30:18] you know they just went out and and took
[30:20] things right out of the ground out of
[30:22] the nature and used those things and
[30:24] they didn't have to have something
[30:25] that's super processed and you know had
[30:27] had to go through things that that you
[30:29] can't even pronounce. You can't even
[30:31] spell.
[30:34] You don't even know what it is.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; But you know, the first thing you start
[30:39] doing just like when when the doctor
[30:41] when I went to the hospital that day,
[30:43] you know, I just I had felt bad for
[30:45] quite a while. And you know, they I
[30:47] finally just decid I got I got to have
[30:49] something done because my heart was
[30:51] fluttering and having so many problems.
[30:52] I was like, I got to have something.
[30:54] Well, you know, they went in and checked
[30:55] me. It's like, hey, you ain't got a
[30:56] heart problem.
[30:57] &gt;&gt; You ain't got cholesterol.
[31:01] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I'm I'm I'm 51 years old.
[31:04] Next month I'll be 52 years old. My
[31:06] cholesterol is under 200.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; And you know because you know I just
[31:14] have faith in God. I I believe what God
[31:16] said. But you know when when they put me
[31:18] on they di diagnosed me with diabetes
[31:22] and that's what that's what they called
[31:23] it. It's the devil.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; But that's what they and they want to
[31:27] put me on medicine. Hey take this
[31:29] medicine. And the one doctor says,
[31:30] 'Well, we think you might get off of it
[31:32] one day. And I like, "Oh, I I I don't I
[31:34] don't know about that. I I don't know. I
[31:36] don't Well, you know what? I appreciate
[31:38] you. I appreciate your study. I I
[31:41] appreciate your expertise,
[31:43] &gt;&gt; but I'm not going to take that."
[31:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; Because you know what? I'm getting off
[31:47] of this thing.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; I do it for a while. Thank God. Just
[31:51] like brother Dale said, you take you
[31:53] take your medicine, the doctor gives you
[31:54] the medicine and then you take it and
[31:56] you take a prayer cloth and you put it
[31:58] with your medicine and say, "By his
[31:59] stripes I'm healed." And you know what?
[32:01] Do what he said. But you know what? Just
[32:03] like pop always told us. He said, "One
[32:05] of these days the doctor will tell you,
[32:06] quit taking that stuff."
[32:09] &gt;&gt; And you know, one day I took it for two
[32:11] and a half years and that's you know,
[32:13] and I I battled that thing all the time.
[32:15] But you know what? I was gonna get free
[32:16] of that devil.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you know,
[32:23] &gt;&gt; I said, "Satan, get behind me."
[32:26] &gt;&gt; You know, you ain't you ain't got any
[32:28] right here. I'm casting you out.
[32:30] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; And so, you know, I battled that thing,
[32:34] but you know what? I praise God that one
[32:36] of the one day I finally got free of
[32:38] that thing. It's like, listen, that's
[32:40] right.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; I appreciate and other people take it
[32:43] and thank God it helps people or
[32:45] whatever, but you know, it's not for me
[32:47] and I ain't taking it because I've seen
[32:49] people I was talking to brother Mark the
[32:51] other day. We was talking about people
[32:52] start on on diabetes medicine. Next
[32:54] thing you know, they got you on
[32:55] cholesterol medicine, they got you on a
[32:57] heart pill, they got you on something
[32:58] else, they got you on something else
[33:00] because all it does is starts
[33:01] deteriorating your body and then you got
[33:03] to get another pill for that pill. And
[33:04] just like brother Brown talking about,
[33:06] you know, you got to take one pill for
[33:06] this and the pill for that. Next thing
[33:08] you know, and he said, you know, then
[33:09] you got to go see the psychiatrist and
[33:10] the psychiatrist got to have a
[33:12] psychiatrist and you know, it just keeps
[33:14] deteriorating. It just keeps going down.
[33:16] Well, you know what? I know that God is
[33:17] the healer. And I just went to God and I
[33:20] believed that he was going to touch me.
[33:21] And you know what? I don't have to take
[33:22] those things. Praise God. And
[33:25] &gt;&gt; I I do I do take my my multivitamins and
[33:28] I take my fish oil and and all those
[33:30] things, but you know what? I'm I'm I'm
[33:31] just I'm just doing what what they want
[33:33] me to do.
[33:40] BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? UH, you know, all
[33:42] things are sanctified by the word of God
[33:44] and prayer.
[33:46] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. And you know, we we
[33:48] live in this world and we can't we can't
[33:49] change a lot of things, but you know,
[33:50] there are certain things that we can
[33:51] change and we can we can do certain
[33:53] things and and you know, I mean, you
[33:55] know,
[33:57] you know, at Christmas time, you know,
[33:59] we we get a lot of candy and and things
[34:02] and you know, people get, you know, and
[34:03] it's like
[34:06] I I I've got I've gotten a lot of candy
[34:09] and chocolate and everything like that.
[34:10] And Sarah's asked me in the past, she's
[34:12] like, "Are you going to eat that?"
[34:15] It's like, well, you know, I I eat it a
[34:16] little bit at a time. I might a little
[34:18] here or there, you know, but you know,
[34:20] I'm not just going to sit down and just
[34:22] fill up on it.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; And if I don't eat it, that's all right.
[34:25] I I'll give it to somebody else. Let
[34:27] them enjoy it.
[34:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; But, you know, like like I told him, I
[34:31] was like, getting on the scale and
[34:33] seeing that number go down.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; It's that's that's a better feeling than
[34:37] anything I've ever in the world.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's a struggle.
[34:44] But you know what God has give us? If if
[34:47] God give you the power to overcome other
[34:49] things, God give you the power to
[34:51] overcome food.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; He had he he had he had do me that way.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; That's tough.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; I mean, but you know, I'm I I go through
[35:00] these things, but you know what? I I
[35:02] still trust God and I still thank God
[35:04] and I still believe
[35:06] &gt;&gt; because you know what? He wants us to
[35:08] prosper and be in health.
[35:11] And so if you have an an problem, then
[35:14] guess what? God will lead you
[35:16] &gt;&gt; and God will help you overcome and you
[35:18] got to battle this thing.
[35:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; And so I I just I just believe that God
[35:24] is the one that'll lead us and take care
[35:27] of us.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Ram was talking about, you
[35:33] know, eating all the things out of this
[35:36] earth and they're not any good. But he
[35:37] said, you know, the thing is that God
[35:40] has given us mana.
[35:42] God give us the spiritual mana, but give
[35:44] us mana to eat on. And and he was he was
[35:47] speaking of of David and he said, you
[35:48] know, eating that spiritual mana. When
[35:51] when David got into certain times in his
[35:54] life and he had all these all these hard
[35:55] problems and different things that he
[35:57] was struggling with, but you know, he
[35:58] went in the presence of God and he began
[36:00] to worship and he began to meditate on
[36:02] God and he began to thank God for all
[36:04] the things that had happened to him. And
[36:05] all of a sudden, you know, he began to
[36:07] have, as brother Brandham said, a real
[36:08] gastronomical jubilee because he began
[36:11] to feast on the things of God. And he
[36:13] began to rejoice in all these things. He
[36:15] said, you know, and and he said, it
[36:17] begins to fill you out
[36:19] &gt;&gt; if you're dealing if you're taking the
[36:21] things of God, it'll give you what you
[36:22] have need of. He said, ' Don't you know,
[36:24] he said, when you when you get real weak
[36:26] and you eat a big great big square meal,
[36:29] how good you feel when you eat something
[36:32] and it fills you up and you know you,
[36:33] whoa, that feels good. He said, like the
[36:36] like that man that went to the doctor
[36:37] that day and he said, he said, doctor,
[36:39] I'm sick. He said, I'm weak. He said,
[36:40] what's the matter? He said, he be the
[36:42] doctor began to ask him. He said, I
[36:43] don't know what's wrong with me. The
[36:45] doctor began to ask him questions. He
[36:46] said, all right. He said, when was the
[36:47] last time you ate? He said, I ate a half
[36:49] a cracker the day before yesterday.
[36:53] He said, "The problem is," he said,
[36:54] "you're hungry."
[36:57] &gt;&gt; And he said, he said, "And that's what's
[36:58] the matter with the church today. It's
[37:00] anemia because they're not getting
[37:02] enough spiritual food." He said, "If
[37:04] they got the Bible, brother, it would
[37:06] put the blood of Christ into the veins
[37:08] of the believer." He said, "New life,
[37:10] new." He said, "Life comes from the
[37:12] blood." Amen. The anemia condition of
[37:14] the church, pitiful, pale cheek. My my
[37:16] we need a transfusion to start off us.
[37:19] Amen.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; Because that's what you have to do is
[37:24] because there's a need that's in the
[37:26] body that you have to go and get these
[37:28] things. And the problem is is people
[37:29] just go through these things and they
[37:31] don't realize what they have need of.
[37:33] But there's a way to go and get what
[37:35] they have need of
[37:38] &gt;&gt; because if you'll go and get these
[37:39] things because he said if you go and get
[37:42] them, he said then you'll have what you
[37:43] have need of. He tells a little story
[37:46] about the calf, you know, the two calves
[37:48] and the one had a had a good farmer and
[37:50] then put him up in the barn and fed him
[37:52] good grain and all kinds of good things
[37:54] all all winter long and the other one
[37:56] was just out eating weeds and just just
[37:59] barely getting by and struggling all all
[38:01] winter just trying to get something to
[38:03] eat and he just getting all thin and
[38:04] couldn't hardly get around. He said the
[38:06] one that was in the barn had been eating
[38:08] all winter. He said when he come out in
[38:09] the springtime, he was out there
[38:11] clicking his heels and jumping up and
[38:13] having a good time and rejoicing and
[38:15] that other one that had struggled the
[38:16] whole time. He said there, "My my my
[38:18] such fanaticism."
[38:21] &gt;&gt; I can't believe that you're doing that.
[38:23] Well, you know what? If you had been in
[38:24] the same condition that one had been in,
[38:26] you'd be doing the exact same thing.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; Because if you'd got into the presence
[38:30] of God and had been get to eat those
[38:33] things like that little calf had had
[38:34] been eating all those things, then you
[38:36] know what? Then you wouldn't be weak.
[38:37] then you wouldn't have problems.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, well, you know what? We're not free
[38:43] from problems. Let me tell you
[38:44] something. When when God's on your side,
[38:46] there's a time that you go through,
[38:49] you get stirred up on the inside, you
[38:50] know what? Your problems don't hold you
[38:52] down.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:00] Why? Because if if you have because the
[39:02] one thing that is promised by by the
[39:04] things that that God gives us is but one
[39:06] of the things he gives us is joy.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; When you have joy, you know what? Then
[39:10] then you have something that carries
[39:12] you.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; You have strength that carries you.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; Because you know you realize that all
[39:18] these things that all your problems are
[39:21] not going to going to things are not
[39:22] going to stay this way forever.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; You know when you go through these
[39:27] storms, praise God, you know what? He
[39:29] comes walking on the water in the midst
[39:31] of your storms when whatever it is, it
[39:33] doesn't matter.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; Even even when even when when
[39:39] Lazarus was there, you know, and got
[39:41] sick and kept getting weak and weak and
[39:43] weak and weaker and you know, all the
[39:45] problems that he had and they went and
[39:46] buried him, you know what? And still God
[39:48] came on the scene.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus knew what was taking place. He had
[39:53] seen the vision of what was going to
[39:55] take place. Well, what he do? He just
[39:56] waiting. Amen.
[39:59] He knew what was going to take place.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; Mary and Martha was down there weeping
[40:03] and wonder what was where was Jesus?
[40:05] Where was Jesus? He was right on time.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; It hadn't come to the time for
[40:09] deliverance yet. But you know what? He
[40:11] was all right on time when he came to
[40:13] the place that when he said he said,
[40:14] "Where does where is where did you lay
[40:16] him? Where is he at?"
[40:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; And went down there and spoke to Lazarus
[40:21] and brought him out of the ground.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; So it was it was in the right time. And
[40:26] sometimes we wonder where's God at?
[40:27] Where's God at? Well, you know what?
[40:29] Sometimes the problem is we don't
[40:30] realize he's waiting to the right time
[40:32] because he's never late.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; We don't know when he's GOING TO BE, BUT
[40:37] YOU KNOW WHAT? HE never fails us. He
[40:39] never forsakes us. He never leaves us.
[40:41] So guess what? He's coming on the scene.
[40:43] All you GOT TO DO IS HAVE EXPECTATION
[40:45] and believe that God's going to do it.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; See, if we believe, we just we just hold
[40:52] on and God will come on the scene.
[40:58] You know, this is from the message, the
[40:59] unwelcome Christ. Brother R was speaking
[41:01] and he was talking about the the
[41:02] meetings that that he was in and holding
[41:04] meetings and and seeing God come down
[41:06] and and and manifest himself. And he
[41:10] said in these meetings where the Holy
[41:11] Spirit comes down and speaks to the
[41:13] people, he says, "Shows signs and
[41:14] wonders and heals the blind, deaf, dumb,
[41:16] paralytics, and so forth, people turn
[41:18] away sometimes. They they they carried
[41:21] that church too late tonight." He said,
[41:24] "Parisee, what's the matter with you?
[41:26] You're in the presence of Christ.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; You're standing in the presence of
[41:31] Christ and not and missing what's taking
[41:34] place."
[41:38] &gt;&gt; He said, "You can ever be sure that that
[41:41] you see his words are moving. You ought
[41:43] to fall on your face and say, "God, be
[41:45] merciful to me."
[41:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; He said, "But we got time for other
[41:49] things." He said, "Oh, I wish he'd hurry
[41:51] up and quit preaching. 20 minutes is
[41:53] long enough for any preacher to preach.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; He said, "Why? You're starving to
[41:59] death."
[42:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "You're so thin, you look like
[42:02] a shadow."
[42:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "You need a good 4hour sermon
[42:08] &gt;&gt; sometimes to fatten you up on gospel
[42:12] vitamins."
[42:13] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's what the church needs
[42:14] today."
[42:18] Because the prayer is we get up in the
[42:20] morning. Thank the Lord that we opened
[42:21] our eyes and we hit the floor and we
[42:24] pray over our food
[42:26] and then we pray now lay me down to
[42:28] sleep.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we we fail to miss God all
[42:33] day long.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; Right.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; But it's it's only when we HAVE A
[42:38] PROBLEM. GOD, WHERE ARE YOU?
[42:45] &gt;&gt; We just we just got God on 911.
[42:51] Heaven 911, what's your emergency?
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; And we wonder why we have a problem.
[43:01] Why? Because,
[43:03] you know, we we miss coming to church
[43:06] sometimes and and and not realize that
[43:08] here here's God speaking to us. God's
[43:11] trying to deal with us. It's like, "Oh,
[43:14] brother, we we we could we could make it
[43:16] four hours." I I I don't know. I don't
[43:18] know what we'd do if we had to sit here
[43:19] four hours.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; But you know what? They can put a movie
[43:24] on.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:37] Gone with the Wind. I'd be Gone with a
[43:38] Wind, too. I'd start that movie.
[43:41] I could I couldn't handle that one.
[43:44] That's a long That's a long movie.
[43:46] And it's like I was telling sister June
[43:48] that that man was talking about uh
[43:50] reading reading Shakespeare and and he
[43:52] was all excited about reading
[43:53] Shakespeare and he was going through
[43:54] there and he was talking about the
[43:55] murder and the intrigue and and all
[43:57] these things that was taking place and
[43:59] and the ghost and all these things like
[44:00] that and that guy another guy was
[44:02] standing there and said but there's no
[44:03] car chase scene in it.
[44:08] So it didn't matter none the rest of it
[44:09] mattered to him but he was just looking
[44:11] for action. He missed all the other
[44:13] things that were in it.
[44:16] And so it's the same way. Sometimes we
[44:18] miss all the things that have taken
[44:19] place and somebody trying to explain to
[44:21] well that that's not what I'm looking
[44:22] for.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; But sometimes when when we get in but we
[44:27] can the things that that we look for the
[44:29] things that we want. But the thing is is
[44:31] if we're of God then the things of God
[44:34] is what we ought to be drawing from.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said the greatest joy that
[44:38] he had the greatest consolation that he
[44:41] had was meditation on God's word. Amen.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; The the best time that he had was
[44:46] meditation and studying in God's word.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; It's like, "Oh, no. My my my my greatest
[44:53] time is watching a ball game
[44:57] &gt;&gt; or sitting in a treeand."
[45:03] &gt;&gt; Well, you know what? Praise God. You You
[45:04] can sit in a treeand and and you can
[45:07] read your Bible
[45:08] &gt;&gt; and you can listen to a message.
[45:12] Or you can be like me, I'm sitting the
[45:14] tree staying as slip,
[45:20] &gt;&gt; and that felt good, too.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; It's like, well, if if the Lord wanted
[45:23] me to have a deer, he he had woke me up.
[45:25] He did wake me up. So,
[45:28] &gt;&gt; and if there was any deer that came by,
[45:30] the Lord, I guess, maybe didn't want
[45:32] them get killed or nothing. So,
[45:33] &gt;&gt; but I enjoyed myself.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; But, you know, God has a provision for
[45:39] each one of us.
[45:41] has something for each one of us.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; So
[45:45] here in the in the message the the
[45:48] blessing this is from the uh message
[45:50] blessing prophet and brother Brown's
[45:53] talking about the people and the things
[45:56] that the the ministry and how the
[45:59] ministry ought to be pressing. And he
[46:03] said if we saw these things, you know,
[46:04] it would cause us to be on our knees
[46:06] praying and and and expressing these
[46:09] things because the the ministry is the
[46:11] one that is supposed to be expressing
[46:13] these things to the to the people.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; And so it's it's our job to do these
[46:18] things. And he said, I I've made up my
[46:20] mind. He said, by the help and grace of
[46:23] God, he said, God will give me the
[46:24] strength to do. He said, I'm determined
[46:26] to press toward the mark of the high
[46:28] calling in Christ Jesus till death shall
[46:30] set me free. God be my helper. Help me
[46:32] in my prayer is my prayer seeing the
[46:35] works and seeing the things that I have
[46:37] seen and you have seen and lagging
[46:39] behind and become a spiritual amnesia or
[46:44] uh anemia,
[46:45] &gt;&gt; a spiritual anemia
[46:48] when you've seen God come on the scene
[46:50] and you've seen the things that that he
[46:52] has seen and he was talking about seeing
[46:54] all the miracles that have taken place
[46:56] in the meetings and all the things and
[46:58] how the ministry is the one that should
[47:00] be taking because you know what it's not
[47:01] it's You you can't blame just the the
[47:03] the the leoty for it.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham laid the laid the blame
[47:08] on the preachers.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; The ministry takes the blame. It's our
[47:13] fault.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; Because if we're not if we're not the
[47:17] example, then don't expect anybody else
[47:18] to do it.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; He said, "But God give us that that we
[47:24] would not be a spiritual anemia."
[47:26] Anemic.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Because if this is what God has given
[47:29] us, then this is what we need to do. We
[47:31] need to be an example to the people. He
[47:34] said, "And to think that after God's
[47:36] doing that," and he said, "and we turn
[47:38] around and dillydally in the things of
[47:40] the world and become a very spiritual
[47:42] anemia." He said, "How we ought to be
[47:45] the lighthouse that set on a hill, a
[47:47] candle that cannot be hid."
[47:49] &gt;&gt; Because if God has given this, then this
[47:51] is what we ought to be doing. This is
[47:53] what we ought to be. We ought to be a
[47:54] shining light for these things. Because
[47:56] if it's taking place and it should be in
[47:58] us, then it should be showing to the
[48:00] world.
[48:01] The world should see these things. And
[48:03] if it's not, then you know what? It
[48:04] should drive us to a place that we
[48:06] repent to drive us to our knees.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; And because if God has given you grace
[48:11] to see these things, then it ought to
[48:12] have a have a place in our heart that we
[48:14] repent and that we would pray for the
[48:16] world.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; That we pray for those that don't see
[48:20] these things.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:23] God want because there there's there if
[48:25] you if you have the have the Holy Ghost
[48:28] on the inside then the Holy Ghost wants
[48:29] to express on the outside then you see
[48:31] people in the condition that they're in
[48:33] and you try to talk to people and you
[48:35] might as well be talking to the wall
[48:38] &gt;&gt; even over simple things.
[48:43] You know, I I've had I've I've had a
[48:44] chance to talk to a man a couple of
[48:46] times about things and it's just, you
[48:48] know, he's got
[48:51] he's he's a Baptist. He's he's a great
[48:54] man. He's Baptist. But let me tell you
[48:55] what, he is he's built on the foundation
[48:59] of the Baptist doctrine.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; And you know what? He was Baptist born
[49:05] and he's Baptist bred. And when he dies,
[49:08] he'll be Baptist dead.
[49:12] because you know what? He ain't getting
[49:14] off of that.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; But he's but he's built on but he
[49:22] believes the Baptist doctrine is the
[49:24] Bible. And if you try to show him
[49:26] anything that's contrary to that, you
[49:27] know what? He go right back to the
[49:28] Bible. He go, "Well, the well, the Bible
[49:30] says this." And we we were talking about
[49:33] about marriage and and things like that.
[49:35] And
[49:37] I I was telling him I was like,
[49:38] "Listen," I said, "You're married by
[49:40] your vow."
[49:43] &gt;&gt; I said, "When you make a vow to a man
[49:45] and he makes a vow to a woman." I said,
[49:46] "Y'all married?" I said, "I don't care
[49:48] what else goes on."
[49:50] &gt;&gt; I said, "That makes a that's the
[49:52] marriage covenant." I said, "What
[49:53] happened in back there when when the
[49:56] angel spoke to Joseph and said, "Don't
[49:59] be afraid to take Mary thy wife." And
[50:01] they hadn't even been together. They
[50:04] were a spouse.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; They were not married.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; But in God's eyes, Mary was Joseph's
[50:10] wife.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; I said, "That's Bible." I said, I said
[50:17] because in the Old Testament, if you
[50:18] made a vow, you are hold you held to
[50:20] that.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; God held you responsible for your for
[50:24] your vow.
[50:26] That's right. Amen.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; I said it's a it's a very serious thing.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:33] Yes,
[50:34] &gt;&gt; you can. You and you know nowadays it's
[50:36] just well you just you just
[50:39] you know they get engaged, break up,
[50:42] shack up, do whatever.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; I said you can't find that in the
[50:47] scripture.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; I said because if you go back into the
[50:53] scripture and you look in the Old
[50:54] Testament, well, we we're we're in the
[50:56] we're in the we're we're in the New
[50:57] Testament. We're under grace. I said,
[50:58] well, you know what? the Paul that that
[51:00] wrote the the New Testament. The Apostle
[51:02] Paul said to flee fornication.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; I said, "That's not Old Testament
[51:10] doctrine. That's New Testament
[51:11] doctrine."
[51:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; And I said, "And for those that know not
[51:16] to do better and they don't," he said,
[51:17] "that's iniquity."
[51:21] &gt;&gt; And every You know what? And God and God
[51:23] is a is a God of mercy and a God of
[51:25] grace, but you know, he's also a God of
[51:26] judgment. Amen.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; And you just can't you just can't go
[51:31] around however you want to and whenever
[51:32] you feel like it that you're just going
[51:34] to plead for God's mercy and just get
[51:37] repentance and he just going to cover
[51:39] you over because he's not some dirty
[51:41] grandpa.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Because you know what? If you if you
[51:45] have if you have bring forth meat for
[51:47] repentance, then you know what? THEN IT
[51:48] PUTS YOU ON A PATH TO GO AWAY FROM THOSE
[51:50] THINGS.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; That's right. And if you can continue to
[51:53] do those things and it doesn't prick
[51:55] your heart, then there's a problem with
[51:56] your birth.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; And the problem is most people never had
[52:00] one.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Well, we just we just go to the we just
[52:07] come to the altar and we just shake the
[52:09] preacher's hand and we we just recite
[52:11] some prayer or whatever and we go to the
[52:13] water and get baptized and that's okay.
[52:18] The problem is is you went to the water
[52:19] and you went down a dry center and you
[52:21] came up a wet one and there hadn't been
[52:23] any change in your life.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; And the problem is is you wonder why
[52:27] kids come into churches and they can't
[52:29] stand anything and they just fall right
[52:31] back out and the devil drags them right
[52:32] back into the world and THEY FILTH THEY
[52:34] JUST HAVE SO MANY PROBLEMS. WHY? BECAUSE
[52:37] THEY'RE they bring the
[52:40] because they bring all of the world
[52:42] right into the church.
[52:46] That's it.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; And they don't know what they don't know
[52:50] what a Christian life is because nobody
[52:52] shows them.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; When you when you have people in church
[52:57] and it's just like, well, we're we're
[52:59] just we're just we're just sinners saved
[53:00] by grace. Amen. We are. But you know
[53:04] what? The Holy Ghost makes a change in
[53:06] your life.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; It begins to change you. You have a
[53:11] because if he's on the inside and he's
[53:12] leading, you have a desire for the
[53:14] things of God
[53:17] &gt;&gt; and you just come to church and just
[53:19] dress however you want to and live
[53:20] however you want to. And you come to
[53:22] church and you got and you don't have
[53:24] enough gumption about you, any moral
[53:27] about you, you'd steal a quarters off a
[53:29] dead man's eyes and you wonder why
[53:31] people why people in the church live the
[53:32] way that they do.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Why? because they've never had an
[53:40] experience. They don't know anything
[53:41] about it.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; And it's not and it's not just and it's
[53:46] not just out in the world. It's many
[53:48] places people people come to church and
[53:50] you know they they've got brother
[53:51] Brandham's books and you know and they
[53:52] and they've got pictures on the wall and
[53:54] on their phone and all kinds of other
[53:56] stuff like that. But you know what they
[53:57] don't they don't have any more idea what
[53:59] the new birth is than than they know
[54:01] about philosophy or they could do
[54:04] Chinese algebra.
[54:08] They don't know anything. They don't
[54:10] know the first thing about it.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Why? Because they they've just come in
[54:14] church and they sat in a building and
[54:16] they heard somebody talk about God sent
[54:17] a prophet and they read quotes, but you
[54:19] know what? They've never been in contact
[54:21] with the life
[54:22] &gt;&gt; when they've never been in contact with
[54:24] the Holy Spirit to lead them to the
[54:26] place because you know what? IT'S IF
[54:28] IT'S DONE ON THE inside of a real true
[54:30] believer that it'll bring it a it'll
[54:32] come across your path.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Why? Because we got so many people. The
[54:41] de the devil's out. He just wants to
[54:43] show you a bunch of counterfeits.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; There's lots of counterfeits. But you
[54:50] know what?
[54:52] Because that's what ought to be down on
[54:54] the inside of us
[54:56] to stir us to say, "Lord, am I living
[54:59] the right kind of life? Am I expressing
[55:01] the things that are of God? Can people
[55:03] see me?" Because if people see me, will
[55:06] they always remember that they see Jesus
[55:08] Christ in me?
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Like the old song,
[55:14] when they looked, they beheld him. When
[55:17] I spoke, they could hear him. When I
[55:20] walked, my every footstep carried them
[55:23] all to Calvary.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; He said, "Let others seek worldly fame.
[55:28] But when someone hears his name, let
[55:31] them recall they saw him in me.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Can people see can see Can people see
[55:40] Jesus Christ in us?
[55:42] &gt;&gt; Not just a book of rules,
[55:46] &gt;&gt; not just dos and don'ts,
[55:49] &gt;&gt; but do they see Jesus Christ?
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Is the Holy Spirit living in through us
[55:54] that can minister to other people?
[55:58] That's what I want.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; I want I want people to to know that
[56:04] that we have tapped in to that source
[56:07] that is flowing through us.
[56:18] Brother Bram says here
[56:27] talking about people today they say well
[56:30] the Holy Ghost is not for today and
[56:31] these things and he said all this divine
[56:33] healing stuff for some other day. See
[56:36] it's not a reflection from God. He said
[56:38] it's a reflection from a creed. He said
[56:41] it's a reflection from a doctrine that's
[56:43] outside the Bible. He said, 'But Hebrews
[56:45] 13:8 said he's the same yesterday,
[56:47] today, and forever. He said, St. John
[56:50] 14:12 said, he said, "He that believeth
[56:52] on me, the works that I do shall he do
[56:54] also." Now, how are you going to take
[56:57] that word out of there? How are you
[56:59] going to add something in its place? He
[57:02] said, "You break the chain of life. Man
[57:04] shall not live by bread alone." Right.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; The bread eternally. He gives he lives
[57:12] by that bread. Physically he lives by
[57:13] this bread.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; He said there's two breads. The Holy
[57:16] Spirit. The Holy Spirit is in you. Says
[57:18] amen to every word of God. If that is
[57:21] the Holy Ghost. Now I want to ask you
[57:23] something. He said, 'N now this is he
[57:26] said this is the pinching point
[57:31] because he was speaking of this and
[57:34] talking about us not eating right and he
[57:36] was talking about when he was growing up
[57:40] and he was he was eating all all the
[57:42] things in the world that you know
[57:44] growing up poor and they didn't have a
[57:46] lot to eat and he was talking about his
[57:48] mama and he said you know she just take
[57:50] fat and they had to render it down and
[57:52] come up with all kind of little stuff to
[57:54] eat and has eaten, ate so poor,
[57:56] &gt;&gt; right?
[57:57] &gt;&gt; But you know, there was something that
[57:58] had to come in
[58:01] to help help him live.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; And you know, Brother Ram always talked
[58:05] about his mama every Saturday she give
[58:07] him a big dose of castor.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; And he's like, "Oh, mama, I can't handle
[58:13] that." He said, "Even even like when he
[58:15] grew up, you know, brother, I still
[58:17] can't stand to smell that today."
[58:20] &gt;&gt; But what was it? He said, "If it don't
[58:21] make you sick, it ain't going to do you
[58:23] any good.
[58:25] What was it? Because they had fed on all
[58:26] kinds of other stuff, but there was
[58:27] something to help get all that stuff out
[58:29] of your system.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you got to take something
[58:33] in to help purge all of that thing to
[58:35] get you to that place.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; See, it's all got to come out.
[58:40] He said, "So, we had all this poor
[58:41] eating." He said, "No wonder we had such
[58:43] malnutrition, everything because of the
[58:44] things we didn't have that was right."
[58:48] &gt;&gt; But see, now he said, he said, "I want
[58:49] to ask you something." He said, "How can
[58:51] a man or a woman who claims to be filled
[58:53] with the Holy Spirit, which is the
[58:54] word?" That's right. He said, "How can
[58:57] you be the flesh of that Holy Spirit, he
[59:00] has made you part of him to reflect the
[59:02] gospel of this age and deny the word
[59:05] that he wrote?"
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; How can we deny the word that was
[59:11] written?
[59:14] &gt;&gt; If if it if it's in the word, then you
[59:16] know what? We believe it. Amen.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Not just not just
[59:22] some idea,
[59:24] &gt;&gt; but it's got to be what's in the word
[59:26] and it's got to be made live. He said,
[59:28] "See, it's by the word." How you live,
[59:30] you live by the word.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram was talking about the the
[59:35] the kind old priest and talking about
[59:38] the kind old priest. You know, he had
[59:39] more of the fruits than Jesus did.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; He show Oh, the kind old priest. The
[59:44] kind old priest. But who lived by the
[59:46] word?
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Who manifested the word?
[59:50] &gt;&gt; He said it's not by the fruit. It says
[59:52] by the word.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; He said man shall not live by fruit
[59:55] alone. He said by by every word that
[59:56] proceeds out of the mouth of God.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; And he was that word. He said see they
[1:00:01] fail to see it. That's what he was
[1:00:03] supposed to do. They couldn't see it
[1:00:05] because they weren't ordained to see it.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; He said he said you can't come to me,
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; but it comes to those that are
[1:00:13] predestinated to it. that you come to
[1:00:16] those things and here you are. You're
[1:00:18] supposed to draw these things and God
[1:00:20] has these things for us.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; And so if you have these things on the
[1:00:26] inside and you're feasting on these
[1:00:27] things and you're drawing these things,
[1:00:29] then you have to you have to get in
[1:00:30] there and take these things that God has
[1:00:34] and you and draw every bit of it.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; And the problem is like brother Ram
[1:00:38] said, he said, you know, because the
[1:00:40] problem that people have is they
[1:00:42] compromise on the word. That's right.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; They've compromised on the word just
[1:00:46] like Eve did. She compromised on the
[1:00:49] word. She didn't hold to the place that
[1:00:51] she had that God had told her. And he
[1:00:54] said, "See, an eagle would not
[1:00:55] compromise."
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, you look," he said, "you
[1:01:00] see all you see all of these the hulks
[1:01:02] and the and the buzzards and everything
[1:01:03] like that. They can eat different things
[1:01:05] and go out and find some dead carrying
[1:01:07] somewhere or whatever and eat this or
[1:01:09] that." And he said, "But you know what?
[1:01:10] A real eagle won't have anything to do
[1:01:12] with that. Why? Because there's nothing
[1:01:15] sustaining in that.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; And that putrid stuff laying there that
[1:01:19] wouldn't have anything to do with it.
[1:01:21] Why? Because the the eagle is looking
[1:01:23] for a fresh keel.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; He said that he said he said see he goes
[1:01:28] and looks. He said he's looking for that
[1:01:30] fresh mana.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; And he said he'll get down there and he
[1:01:34] said he'll dig till he finds it. He'll
[1:01:35] fly higher and higher. He said if it's
[1:01:37] not in this valley, he'll raise up a
[1:01:39] little higher. He'll fly to the next
[1:01:40] one. He'll keep looking because he's
[1:01:42] going to find it.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; He said, "So, it's time for the eagles
[1:01:46] of this day to get to flying higher, dig
[1:01:48] into God's promises, not live on vulture
[1:01:51] food that's been killed years ago. Get
[1:01:53] out of that."
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; See, you have to get away from those
[1:01:57] things.
[1:01:59] Well, what what do you what do we need?
[1:02:01] Brother Bam told about the condition
[1:02:02] that the world was in, the condition
[1:02:04] that the church is in. He said, "Why?"
[1:02:06] Because he said, "We don't have any more
[1:02:07] prayer meetings."
[1:02:09] He said, "No more agonizing with God to
[1:02:11] fulfill his word." He said, "No more
[1:02:14] believing that God is still the same
[1:02:16] yesterday, today, and forever." He said,
[1:02:18] "They just vulturize down, get a
[1:02:20] denomination, put their name on the
[1:02:22] book, and got lazy and soft, and sets
[1:02:24] back their gloating on some kind of a
[1:02:26] dead carrying."
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; And he said there's supposed to be at
[1:02:30] least a hulk that's a similar brother to
[1:02:32] the eagle, the prophet. That's the true
[1:02:34] word manifested.
[1:02:37] But now they just go back to something
[1:02:39] from the past,
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; living on some kind of dead carcass
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; and leaving the things behind and not
[1:02:48] trying to dig in
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; and find their own
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; and seeking God to lead them.
[1:02:56] Oh, my pastor is so and so.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Well, you know what? You can you can
[1:03:02] come to church and Brother Wade can be
[1:03:04] your pastor. He can be your pastor every
[1:03:06] day of your life and you can come in,
[1:03:07] pay your ti, and come sit on the pew.
[1:03:10] And you know what? If you don't have a
[1:03:11] new birth experience and you don't if
[1:03:13] you don't grow beyond that, you can sit
[1:03:16] here and go to hell and brother Wayade
[1:03:17] will still be your pastor.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; And it won't do you any it won't do you
[1:03:24] any good.
[1:03:28] Because we had people
[1:03:32] just like Judas.
[1:03:34] Judas was there
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; and walked walked with the word made
[1:03:38] flesh. The son of man walked in his
[1:03:40] midst
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; and it didn't do him a bit of good. Why?
[1:03:45] Because he he was not ordained to that.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; But he stood right there with Jesus.
[1:03:50] Walked with Jesus, ate with Jesus, had
[1:03:52] all these things. what saw all the
[1:03:54] miracles,
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; preached the word, had all these things
[1:03:57] happen. You know what? He still went to
[1:03:58] hell.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; See, you can't can't live on the things
[1:04:07] that came from for another hour.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; It's it's for this day.
[1:04:13] Well, thank God for the things that come
[1:04:14] in the past because you know what?
[1:04:17] There's a day when when Martin when when
[1:04:20] St. Mart uh Martin Luther's message
[1:04:22] came. See, that was the new birth for
[1:04:24] their day. That put them in the body.
[1:04:26] And thank God for that because you know
[1:04:27] what? The truth of that still is holding
[1:04:29] today. We still hold to that message
[1:04:32] today. Just the just shall live by
[1:04:34] faith. Justification is still an
[1:04:36] important part of the journey. We still
[1:04:38] have to have that. But you know what?
[1:04:40] God didn't stop there because it's time
[1:04:42] as we go on TO NOT JUST GET PAST
[1:04:44] JUSTIFICATION, but get to a place where
[1:04:45] you get sanctified. and you know that
[1:04:47] you've had a had an experience of
[1:04:49] sanctification and know that things that
[1:04:51] you've had in your past are clear from
[1:04:53] you when the unclean spirit that's
[1:04:55] inside of a man has been driven out and
[1:04:57] you know that you've had a change.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Not some kind of hocus pocus or
[1:05:05] something,
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; not some kind of idea, but you've
[1:05:08] actually had something that's actually
[1:05:10] true that you know what experience took
[1:05:12] place.
[1:05:12] &gt;&gt; That's right. Something took place
[1:05:14] inside of you that nobody else can argue
[1:05:16] out you out of.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; See, God has promised these things to
[1:05:24] us. See the things Martin Luther Wesley
[1:05:29] Pentecost.
[1:05:31] Thank God for the gifts of the spirit.
[1:05:33] Thank God for the moving of the Holy
[1:05:35] Spirit, the indwelling of the Holy
[1:05:36] Spirit to take up residence in us to
[1:05:39] have to have our own day of Pentecost.
[1:05:42] Amen.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Having that same Pentecostal experience
[1:05:45] that they had back there.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; I know that. I know it took place back
[1:05:51] there because it took place in me.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; It took I know what it's like.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; And not and not worry about, you know,
[1:06:07] what everybody, you know, if if you
[1:06:08] don't if you don't believe, that's okay.
[1:06:12] It ain't changing me,
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; I pray for you.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; But I know I know what to what took
[1:06:19] place in me.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; And so we see all these things were
[1:06:23] promised in the days brother said he
[1:06:25] promised all these things in the days of
[1:06:27] others. But he said now he promised us a
[1:06:29] full square meal.
[1:06:32] He said the full seven course menu for
[1:06:35] all the seven seals are open and
[1:06:36] everything is ready for the word of God
[1:06:39] to those who can receive it.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; So it's been open to us that we can
[1:06:44] receive these things and it's it's
[1:06:47] carried on and thank God that God has
[1:06:51] revealed these things to us in our day
[1:06:53] and now we have these things to eat. Not
[1:06:55] not mana from another day, not meat from
[1:06:57] another day, but the meat for our day.
[1:07:00] Amen.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; He said the things of yesterday, he said
[1:07:02] all of it is rotten. It's no good.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; He said a genuine eagle of this day
[1:07:08] knows that was all right, but we got
[1:07:11] that plus
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; until Jesus Christ is made manifest in
[1:07:15] the fullness of his power as he promised
[1:07:18] to be in this last day. Right?
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; So, it's been promised to us that we can
[1:07:24] take a hold of these things and we can
[1:07:26] draw from these things and receive these
[1:07:28] things and become these things.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; These things are ours.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; And praise God that we realize that in
[1:07:36] this day, God has given us the word, but
[1:07:38] he came through the prophet. But the pro
[1:07:41] brother Brandham set things in order.
[1:07:43] God set things in order through the
[1:07:44] prophet. Through the message, the things
[1:07:47] were set in order for us to follow.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:51] See, then we realize that it becomes
[1:07:53] through the ministry. And thank God,
[1:07:55] Brother Brandon was was speaking of how
[1:07:58] he was speaking in in the message the
[1:08:00] uncertain sound. And he was talking
[1:08:02] about coming into the to the meetings
[1:08:04] and he said, "Thank God for the
[1:08:05] ministers, different ministers with
[1:08:07] different types of ministry that it
[1:08:09] might serve the purpose and might feed
[1:08:11] the flock which the Holy Spirit has made
[1:08:13] them overseer." Amen.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; So, there's different types of ministry
[1:08:17] because there's a five-fold ministry
[1:08:18] that sits under the prophet's message
[1:08:21] that's taking these things and they are
[1:08:23] taking these things and they are
[1:08:24] preaching these things and breaking
[1:08:26] these things down to the people and is
[1:08:28] reaching them. And without that, you're
[1:08:29] not going to receive exactly what you
[1:08:31] have need of.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; The problem that people have today is
[1:08:34] they've turned away from the five-fold
[1:08:36] ministry. Oh, we don't need that
[1:08:37] anymore. We need it more today than we
[1:08:39] ever have. Amen.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; He said because teaching is what's
[1:08:47] needed. Every every every gift of God is
[1:08:50] is is needed and is important. If God
[1:08:52] called you to a place then then it's it
[1:08:55] behooves us to do our part.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; I was listen to brother Donnie Reagan
[1:09:00] one time and you know he was talking
[1:09:01] about you know he said some brothers he
[1:09:03] said they may never preach some
[1:09:04] convention. He said they may not do
[1:09:05] these different things. He said, "They
[1:09:07] they may just preach occasionally, do
[1:09:09] these different things behind the scenes
[1:09:11] or whatever." He said, "But you know
[1:09:12] what? They're still called of God." And
[1:09:14] he said, "They're still doing what God
[1:09:15] called them to do." And he said,
[1:09:16] "They're still working in the plan of
[1:09:18] God."
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; And he said, "We are we we respect them.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; We ought to give them a respect because
[1:09:25] God, that's their God's servant."
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Whether it's big or little or whatever,
[1:09:32] you know what it doesn't matter. The
[1:09:34] thing is is if we are respectful and
[1:09:37] honor the position that God has called a
[1:09:39] man to and honor his calling
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; and respect that and the man do his job.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; I thank God for all of our brothers.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; We do we do our part.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; But what brother say? See everybody does
[1:09:58] their part. It takes a five-fold
[1:09:59] ministry. Every part is important. It
[1:10:02] has a every part has its has its place.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; But you know brother Ram said he talking
[1:10:06] about the preaching. He said preaching
[1:10:08] catches the sinner and brings him under
[1:10:10] condemnation to the word. He catches the
[1:10:12] word and he receives the word. He said
[1:10:13] but it's teaching.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; He said it's teaching that positionally
[1:10:17] places you in the body to show you who
[1:10:19] you are.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; It it's required that you realize who
[1:10:24] you are. who we are
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; because that's what the message of this
[1:10:28] hour has done to show us who we are and
[1:10:30] to place us where we need to be.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Well, because this time is a bride
[1:10:41] that's mature.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; A bride that comes to maturity, comes to
[1:10:46] the place that God wants us to be. Amen.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:10:55] we must receive these things. We need to
[1:10:58] grow up on these things and and
[1:11:00] in this is from the message Christ the
[1:11:03] mystery. Brother Brandon was talking
[1:11:05] about the the vision that he had and you
[1:11:08] know he was he was there and and you
[1:11:10] know the the Lord wouldn't let him go
[1:11:12] overseas and and you know they they
[1:11:14] wanted him to come and he was like no I
[1:11:16] can't go and he saw the little white
[1:11:17] boat and he said it was just that one
[1:11:19] meeting and he said I couldn't go and he
[1:11:21] said the Lord began to speak to him. He
[1:11:22] said but store up the food.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; He said now store up this food.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; He said because it's it'll be it'll be
[1:11:30] needed later on. He said you need to
[1:11:31] store up this food. And he said, he
[1:11:33] said, 'Lord, you know, he said, he said,
[1:11:35] I've tried to do that, you know, as much
[1:11:37] as I could, you know, trying sincerely
[1:11:39] to do these things. And he said, you
[1:11:42] know, I seen that vision. And he said
[1:11:44] there, he said, to store up the food,
[1:11:46] and he said they were bringing it into
[1:11:47] the tabernacle.
[1:11:50] And he said, he said, I saw those fine,
[1:11:52] healthy looking vegetables that I saw in
[1:11:55] the vision being stored in here in this
[1:11:57] tabernacle. He said, may we today
[1:11:59] receive a whole barrel full of that.
[1:12:02] Grant it, Lord. He said, or a tape load
[1:12:04] that it might reveal Jesus Christ to us
[1:12:06] in the hour that we live to give us
[1:12:09] sustaining strength, the spiritual
[1:12:11] strength for the task that lays ahead.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; That we receive these things. And so, as
[1:12:16] brother Brandon began talking about
[1:12:18] storing up the food, storing up the
[1:12:19] food. Well, you know what? Now, there's
[1:12:21] your food that you get into
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; and you have to take every bit of these
[1:12:25] things that that God has for you and get
[1:12:28] in there and dig and take everything and
[1:12:30] eat all of it. Yes, sir.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Receive all of it. You know, because if
[1:12:34] you don't have a a balanced diet, you
[1:12:36] miss out one part of that, one little
[1:12:38] aspect somewhere, and you're going to
[1:12:40] have a problem in your growth.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; And people and even the problem that
[1:12:45] some people have is even when the when
[1:12:47] the ministry has began to preach and
[1:12:49] begin to discern these things and tell
[1:12:51] people exactly what they have need of
[1:12:53] and show their their place. The problem
[1:12:55] is is they don't go beyond that and
[1:12:57] accept that and and take that and say,
[1:12:59] "Yes, Lord, that's me and I'm just going
[1:13:01] to accept that and I'm gonna walk in
[1:13:02] that and I'm gonna eat that and I'm
[1:13:04] gonna feast on this." Because some
[1:13:06] people, they just sit there with their
[1:13:07] arms folded and just stick their tongue,
[1:13:09] you know, their bottom lip out.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Well, I can't believe you said that
[1:13:12] about me.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; WELL, THE PROBLEM IS IS YOU'RE MISSING
[1:13:17] the Holy Spirit speaking to you.
[1:13:25] you don't have any rights.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; He said sheep don't have any rights.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; But the problem is is we miss God. God
[1:13:33] begins to speak to us and and we and not
[1:13:35] realizing that sometimes it's like,
[1:13:37] well, I I I don't like that preacher.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Well, you know what? That's not that
[1:13:42] that don't really matter anything.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; What did he say?
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't like him because he steps
[1:13:48] on my toes.
[1:13:50] That's right.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Well, that's all right.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Maybe the Lord need to step on your toes
[1:13:54] some more.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Like I like I tell everybody, I bought a
[1:13:59] brand new pair of shoes one time sitting
[1:14:01] on the front row up here where brother
[1:14:02] Ryan's at. Brand new pair of shoes. Wore
[1:14:05] them church one time. I bought them.
[1:14:08] Wore them church sitting right up here.
[1:14:10] Brother Dale said, "Brother Aaron
[1:14:11] wouldn't mind if I step on his toes."
[1:14:14] And he's always stepping on my brand new
[1:14:15] shoes. Like I don't mind you stepping on
[1:14:18] my toes. I just don't want you to step
[1:14:19] on my new shoes.
[1:14:23] But see, God knows how to how to reach
[1:14:25] you.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; He gives you what you have need of.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; And I was like, well,
[1:14:31] I hope they hope they look all right.
[1:14:36] But, you know, God knows what he's
[1:14:38] doing.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; And he gives us what we have need of.
[1:14:43] And so sometimes when we when we miss
[1:14:45] these things,
[1:14:47] we we we see these things that's taking
[1:14:49] place. Sometimes we miss the things that
[1:14:51] are taking place and not realize these
[1:14:53] things are for us.
[1:14:57] you know,
[1:14:59] uh was uh went to the doctor few weeks
[1:15:04] ago
[1:15:05] and uh the last the last two times they
[1:15:09] they've done blood work on me. They're
[1:15:12] telling me some of my numbers are not
[1:15:13] right.
[1:15:15] So, um, they they put me on, uh, well,
[1:15:19] you know, if y'all have my chart, if y
[1:15:20] if y'all go to the the hospital and you
[1:15:22] get the my chart and then they they send
[1:15:24] you this list about this long and all
[1:15:26] these words and it's like, I don't
[1:15:28] understand any of it. So, the words you
[1:15:30] don't, you take a dictionary, you look
[1:15:31] them up and you start trying to you read
[1:15:32] up on all this stuff and so, you know,
[1:15:34] they give you this page and after a
[1:15:36] while you've you've spent quite a while
[1:15:38] reading this stuff and trying to become
[1:15:40] a doctor, a web MD trying to figure out
[1:15:43] all this stuff. But uh you know they
[1:15:45] they said well your your iron's a little
[1:15:47] low and and this is a little low and
[1:15:49] that's not right and and but you know we
[1:15:52] won't take you we want you to take iron
[1:15:54] and they were like you need to take iron
[1:15:57] take some more iron pills you need to
[1:15:58] get your blood up hemoglobin up all this
[1:16:00] kind of stuff you know here but okay
[1:16:04] well you know I got to reading all this
[1:16:05] stuff
[1:16:07] and I just didn't take them and it's
[1:16:08] like well just take my just take my iron
[1:16:10] every day like like I'm supposed to pop
[1:16:11] my iron pop my iron
[1:16:14] Well, I got to reading I got to digging
[1:16:16] and that that my chart stuff got to
[1:16:19] reading on all that stuff. Now he's
[1:16:21] like, "Well, this is this over here says
[1:16:24] some word." I was like, "What is that?"
[1:16:26] So, I go look it up. Oh, well, that's
[1:16:29] your B vitamins. Oh, okay. So, you multi
[1:16:33] your complex B vitamins, folate, and all
[1:16:36] that other stuff. It's like, okay. Start
[1:16:38] reading on this and oh, this is this
[1:16:40] like okay. began to read on all this
[1:16:42] stuff. Come to find out after doing a
[1:16:45] little research and reading I have two
[1:16:48] problems
[1:16:51] whether on on that charge the the two
[1:16:53] that I'm talking about.
[1:16:57] But the problem the problem that I have
[1:16:59] is I have low B vitamins and I have low
[1:17:02] iron.
[1:17:04] I told him I said I don't understand
[1:17:05] that. I like I like eating meat every
[1:17:07] day. I ate steak all the time. They
[1:17:10] said, "Well, you have this." Well, here,
[1:17:12] just take this iron. So, I'm going to
[1:17:13] take my iron. Well, I got to reading.
[1:17:15] Well, guess what? You know what helps
[1:17:16] your body absorb iron?
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; You know what helps your body absorb
[1:17:21] iron? Your B complex vitamins.
[1:17:26] And guess what is low in my body?
[1:17:30] B complex vitamins.
[1:17:33] But just take your iron. And not only if
[1:17:36] your vitamin your B vitamins are low,
[1:17:39] your body can't absorb and utilize the
[1:17:42] iron you have in your body
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; because your B vitamins are low.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; And I was like, well, thank you.
[1:17:52] Well, you know what? I could have took
[1:17:54] all of the I could have took all the
[1:17:55] iron that I wanted to.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Just take the iron.
[1:18:02] But you know what the problem is? is I
[1:18:05] needed more than just the iron.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; And so if you're not taking a full
[1:18:10] balanced diet, if you're not getting
[1:18:12] every nutrient, if you're not getting
[1:18:14] every vitamin, if you're not getting
[1:18:15] every mineral, then guess what? You're
[1:18:17] off
[1:18:19] and you can have Oh, just take more of
[1:18:21] this one. Just take more of this one.
[1:18:22] Take Well, you know what? That's not
[1:18:23] going to help.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Because you're missing the other one.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; I was like, well, you know what? I'm
[1:18:31] going to self-medicate myself.
[1:18:36] So, I went out and I started taking B
[1:18:38] vitamins, multivitamins,
[1:18:42] trying to eat things that's got vitamins
[1:18:44] in it. And it's like, well, you know
[1:18:46] what? I got all this other stuff. Well,
[1:18:47] you know, I can pop all the iron I want
[1:18:49] to.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; But if there but if it's not in your
[1:18:53] body to utilize it, then your body's
[1:18:55] going to reject it.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Your body's going to lose it. It ain't
[1:18:58] going to be able to absorb it.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:01] And it's the same thing in the word of
[1:19:03] God.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; If we don't take every word that
[1:19:08] proceeds out of the mouth of God
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; and we don't take everything in
[1:19:12] complimentary
[1:19:14] portion,
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; then if you have one and it's like, oh,
[1:19:17] I just I just I just I just love them
[1:19:20] evangelists. I just love that fiery
[1:19:22] preacher. But you know what the problem
[1:19:23] is? If when you begin to get to a
[1:19:25] certain place, then you know what?
[1:19:26] You've not had any teaching.
[1:19:30] And you've and you've missed out.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; And everybody's like, "Well, you know
[1:19:36] what? I don't I don't I don't need a
[1:19:38] pastor. I just I just sit and just speak
[1:19:40] to the Lord and I just listen to the
[1:19:42] prophet."
[1:19:46] Well, how many times did the did he say,
[1:19:48] "You need a post of duty, you need a
[1:19:50] pastor, you need a you need a church."
[1:19:55] No, I just go get in my boat and I float
[1:19:58] out on the water and read my Bible on
[1:19:59] Sunday morning.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; I had a man tell me that before.
[1:20:05] Head church on the water.
[1:20:11] Really? Forsake not the assembling of
[1:20:13] yourselves together? Who else are you
[1:20:15] assembling with?
[1:20:18] The fish in the water. the birds in the
[1:20:21] air.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; See, it's important that we be together.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; And everybody likes to think we're we're
[1:20:36] just an we're just an army of one, but
[1:20:38] you know what? We're really not.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; We're a soldier in the army of the Lord,
[1:20:43] and it takes every one of us.
[1:20:48] You don't you don't fulfill everything
[1:20:49] and I don't fulfill everything.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; I do my part, you do your part. We're a
[1:20:54] body.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; It's a body ministry.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; We minister to one another. We help one
[1:21:00] another.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; And so, everybody has to do their part
[1:21:03] to compleiment each other.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; And if you're going to if you're going
[1:21:07] to grow and have the right kind of
[1:21:09] growth, then you know what? The things
[1:21:10] that you don't like, well, that's the
[1:21:12] things that you need.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:14] That's right.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Because, you know, I I have I have I
[1:21:21] have two boys. Everybody knows. I have
[1:21:24] have one that eats he has he likes a
[1:21:27] variety of things. He eats things I
[1:21:29] don't even like.
[1:21:32] But, you know, I mean, he he likes he
[1:21:34] likes a lot of things that that I I
[1:21:36] would skip, but you know, he he likes
[1:21:38] salads and lot other stuff. And then uh
[1:21:41] the other one
[1:21:43] he you can put all the vegetables he
[1:21:45] likes I think on one hand. You can count
[1:21:46] them on one hand
[1:21:50] but you know he likes fruit.
[1:21:54] But you know you you look at but you
[1:21:56] know
[1:21:58] one he likes to eat a little healthier.
[1:22:00] The other one is like, you know,
[1:22:04] um,
[1:22:07] like I I I think he could live on fast
[1:22:10] food.
[1:22:15] But you you you see the the the kind of
[1:22:18] life that the things that you're eating,
[1:22:20] you can eat these things because they
[1:22:21] taste good. You like these things,
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; But the problem is is is it giving you
[1:22:27] the nourishment that you need?
[1:22:30] Are you getting are you getting
[1:22:31] everything that you you have need of?
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; It's like, well, well, I don't like this
[1:22:38] and I don't like that. Well, you know
[1:22:39] what? You need to find the things
[1:22:43] that sustain you.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Cuz let me tell you something. If the
[1:22:49] Holy Ghost is on the inside
[1:22:52] and the Holy Ghost is leading you
[1:22:58] and the word is being born in you
[1:23:01] and you're manifesting the word,
[1:23:05] the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:23:07] is to bring forth Jesus Christ. Right?
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; Then you go out and you find a mother
[1:23:14] that's carrying a baby
[1:23:16] and when she needs certain things in her
[1:23:18] diet. Oh, I hate that. Then all of a
[1:23:22] sudden, guess what? There's a change
[1:23:24] that takes place and the things that
[1:23:27] Well, you know what? I never like
[1:23:29] turnipss or whatever. And all of a
[1:23:31] sudden, you know, I JUST CAN'T GET
[1:23:32] ENOUGH of them.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; And you know what? And I never like this
[1:23:37] boy. I just I'm I'm just eating I just I
[1:23:39] just love it. I just can't just can't
[1:23:41] get enough of it. Just eat and eat. Why?
[1:23:43] Because that's what's needed in the
[1:23:45] body.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; And if you're going to have Jesus Christ
[1:23:50] in your life, if you're going to
[1:23:51] manifest Jesus Christ, then the things
[1:23:54] that's inside of you, then the word is
[1:23:56] calling for those things, then he's
[1:23:58] because brother Brandham said, he said
[1:24:00] the Holy Ghost is on the inside waiting
[1:24:01] for you to bring him the word. Amen.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Then if he if he's on the inside, then
[1:24:08] he's going to be calling out for those
[1:24:09] things and you say, "Well, you know, I
[1:24:10] don't like that." But you know what? If
[1:24:12] there's an expression of God on the
[1:24:14] inside, you're going to be calling,
[1:24:15] "Lord, that's what I need. Lord, I want
[1:24:17] these things because that's what I need
[1:24:19] to grow."
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; When it becomes a place when you begin
[1:24:22] to realize, I need this. This is what's
[1:24:25] lacking in my life. This is where I need
[1:24:27] to grow, Lord. Then help me.
[1:24:31] then El Shadai is there
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; and you can begin to nurse
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; to get all the nourishment that you have
[1:24:39] need of
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; as Jesus said, "Man shall not live by
[1:24:43] bread alone,
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; but by every word that proceedth out of
[1:24:46] the mouth of God."
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this evening. Let's
[1:24:50] all stand. We'll have the musicians
[1:24:51] come.
[1:24:58] I want to receive all that God has for
[1:25:00] me.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; I don't want to I don't want to be
[1:25:04] malnourished. I don't want to bring
[1:25:06] forth anything. I want I want to be a
[1:25:08] full healthy Christian.
[1:25:15] Lord, give me the things that I have
[1:25:16] need of.
[1:25:18] Amen. God bless you tonight.
[1:25:22] Let's sing a song.

[1:28:28] my life.
[1:28:33] For I should have fallen
[1:28:38] my soul

[1:31:08] until there's just no more to give. I
[1:31:15] want to love.
[1:31:18] Oh love till there's just no more love.
[1:31:24] For I can never
[1:31:27] ever out love my Lord.
[1:31:34] Oh, I want to live
[1:31:37] the way
[1:31:40] he wants me to live. And I want to give
[1:31:47] until there's just no more to give. I
[1:31:54] want to love
[1:31:58] love till there's just no more love. For
[1:32:04] I can never
[1:32:07] ever outflow
[1:32:10] my Lord.
[1:32:14] Oh, shine
[1:32:17] on me.
[1:32:19] Lord, shine
[1:32:22] on me.
[1:32:25] Let your light
[1:32:27] from your lighthouse
[1:32:31] shine
[1:32:33] on me,
[1:32:35] Lord. Shine
[1:32:38] on me,
[1:32:40] Lord. Shine
[1:32:43] on me.
[1:32:45] Protect your light
[1:32:48] from your lighthouse.
[1:32:51] Oh, shine
[1:32:53] on me, Lord.
[1:32:56] Shine
[1:32:58] down on me,
[1:33:01] Lord. Shine
[1:33:03] on me.
[1:33:06] So let your light
[1:33:08] from the lighthouse
[1:33:12] shine
[1:33:14] on me.
[1:33:16] Oh, shine
[1:33:19] on me.
[1:33:21] Oh, shine
[1:33:24] all me. Let's worship him.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Let the light from the lighthouse
[1:33:32] shine. Sing it to him one more time.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, shine
[1:33:39] on me.
[1:33:41] Let it shine
[1:33:44] on me.
[1:33:46] Let the light You heard a wonderful
[1:33:48] message tonight. Let's reap the
[1:33:51] benefits. Shine
[1:33:53] on me.
[1:33:57] Shine
[1:33:59] on me,
[1:34:01] Lord. Shine
[1:34:04] on me.
[1:34:06] Let the light
[1:34:08] from your lighthouse
[1:34:12] shine
[1:34:14] on me.
[1:34:17] Oh my wonderful message. Let's give our
[1:34:19] brother a wonderful hand.
[1:34:24] You know, I pray that that light will
[1:34:25] shine on all of us. I was uh
[1:34:30] as Aaron said, I went to sleep in a deer
[1:34:31] stand. I was actually watching the
[1:34:33] service. So, I finally got some I got
[1:34:35] some good reception and I I had to hold
[1:34:36] it up like this, but I could get the the
[1:34:38] service. And I sitting there and it was
[1:34:41] 17° and
[1:34:44] you know when that light
[1:34:46] will shine on you, what does it do? It
[1:34:49] warms you up
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; every time. Doesn't matter if it's 5°.
[1:34:54] If you get in the ray of a sunlight, it
[1:34:57] will instantly warm you up. So in this
[1:35:01] cold, dark world that we live in,
[1:35:04] there's one ray of light and he's
[1:35:05] shining on each one of us.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; If you have the Holy Ghost today, God's
[1:35:09] shining his light on you.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; He promised he'd never leave us. He'd
[1:35:13] never forsake us. He'd never leave.
[1:35:15] Listen, this world is cold.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; It's a cold world, but you and I are the
[1:35:21] only light in this whole world. We're
[1:35:23] the only people that have the true
[1:35:25] light.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; And we sure appreciate all of you. Thank
[1:35:28] you for this weekend. Um, looking out.

[1:35:32] finally figured out what a shind dig
[1:35:34] was. I uh I asked told him I said what I
[1:35:38] know what that is now. I didn't know
[1:35:39] what it was and I do now. But uh it was

[1:38:25] minds and hearts clear. You love the
[1:38:27] Lord. Just remember that this coming
[1:38:29] weekend, uh, Brother Luis will be
[1:38:32] speaking, brother I'll be at brother
[1:38:33] Richard Wilson's. And then, uh, the next
[1:38:36] Sunday, Brother Daryl Ward will be with
[1:38:38] us. And then starting on January the
[1:38:40] 25th,
[1:38:41] uh, we will start on our series on the
[1:38:43] seals on January the 25th, which will be
[1:38:46] the last Sunday this month. And uh we uh
[1:38:49] appreciate your prayers and support. Uh
[1:38:52] brother um Isaac and them from Ohio.
[1:38:55] They are going to um not have their
[1:38:58] service during that time and they're
[1:38:59] going to stream in just like they used
[1:39:00] to before. But they're hungry. They want
[1:39:02] to know. They want to hear. So we want
[1:39:05] to hear, too.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; I want to get as much out of this as you
[1:39:08] get out of this. But I just believe, and
[1:39:10] I'm going to tell you real quick, I
[1:39:12] believe this is the last push
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; to get us out of here.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; And if you're not happy about it, you
[1:39:20] need the Holy Ghost.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; If you love this world and the things of
[1:39:24] this world, the love of God is not in
[1:39:26] you.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Now, there's a lot of things I like to
[1:39:28] do and there's a lot of things you like
[1:39:29] to do that are human.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; But if we don't put God first, folks,
[1:39:33] I'm telling you, we're in bad shape.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; If we don't put his his kingdom above
[1:39:40] our kingdom,
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; then we're in trouble. His kingdom
[1:39:44] always is first. The kingdom of God is
[1:39:48] eternal.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; The kingdom down here is not.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; But remember, we're we're not time.
[1:39:53] We're cap we're trapped in time, but
[1:39:54] we're not time creatures.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; That's why it's going to be easy for us
[1:39:57] to slip over into eternity one day, and
[1:40:00] we'll get out of here. Let let uh the
[1:40:03] world burn itself up. Um, I was, uh, the
[1:40:07] guys I was hunting with, it was about,
[1:40:09] uh, six of them, I think, were from, uh,
[1:40:12] New York and New Jersey and Maine and
[1:40:17] and Pennsylvania. And there was no
[1:40:20] Southerners there at all, except me, me
[1:40:22] and Mike, the guy that went with me, and
[1:40:25] and we had a discussion. I just want to
[1:40:27] tell you how the world is. The world the
[1:40:29] world thinks if they're just good,
[1:40:31] they're going to heaven.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; That's right. They drank their liquor.
[1:40:35] They drank their martinis. They cursed
[1:40:37] every sentence. They cursed. But they
[1:40:39] were Roman Catholics. And they said, and
[1:40:41] we had a discussion about why me and and
[1:40:44] Mike didn't do the things that they did
[1:40:46] and why it was wrong for them to do it.
[1:40:48] Well, you ought to have heard all these
[1:40:49] discussions because they were very
[1:40:50] educated. One was a gynecologist, one
[1:40:52] was a dentist, one ran some kind of big
[1:40:56] um um what is it? Um plumbing place up
[1:40:59] north somewhere. They were highly
[1:41:01] educated people, but they couldn't
[1:41:02] understand. All they think is he said,
[1:41:05] "My priest will will get me through.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; My priest will get me through
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; and it don't matter what I do or say. I
[1:41:14] can go to the priest." And one of them
[1:41:16] looked at me and he said, "I'm faithful
[1:41:20] and I'm good to people."
[1:41:22] And I started to say, "So was Judas."
[1:41:24] But I didn't. I wanted to still wanted
[1:41:26] to hunt with them. They had guns, so I
[1:41:28] wanted to still hunt with them. So I I
[1:41:30] just kind of looked at him and I said,
[1:41:33] "A lot of times goodness is not good
[1:41:35] enough.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; You got to have a birth." Like brother
[1:41:37] Aaron said, you got to know that you
[1:41:39] know that you know
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; you got to have a change in your life.
[1:41:43] That's right.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; And they don't understand that. They
[1:41:45] don't want to change. They don't want
[1:41:46] the Lord to be the Lord of their life.
[1:41:47] They just want to know who Jesus is and
[1:41:49] know who the Catholic Church is. And I
[1:41:50] I'm sorry for those people,
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; I feel sorry for them in my heart. I do.
[1:41:55] I it grieves me bad to know that there's
[1:41:58] I just met six people from up north and
[1:42:00] I ain't saying nothing about Yankees but
[1:42:01] but they're just all Catholics and they
[1:42:03] just all drink and they they have no
[1:42:05] sense of of Christianity, true
[1:42:07] Christianity. Why? They've been told
[1:42:10] what Christianity was.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; They've never experienced true
[1:42:14] Christianity. So, I hope that with me
[1:42:16] and Mike was there and that Mike's a guy
[1:42:18] that does a catering here at here at the
[1:42:20] church and him and his wife and and to
[1:42:22] be just a nominal Christian. He's a
[1:42:24] devout Christian. Uh doesn't drink,
[1:42:26] smoke, cuss or and he talks about the
[1:42:28] Lord all the time and and we sure do
[1:42:30] appreciate that. But just remember this
[1:42:32] world, there's people in this world
[1:42:33] that's looking for God. And like brother
[1:42:34] Aaron said, the only way he's going to
[1:42:35] see is you.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Only way they're going to see God is
[1:42:38] you. That's right.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; So, let's just let's make sure this year
[1:42:42] we sharpen our pencil, we study more, we
[1:42:46] pray more because if we don't, we're not
[1:42:50] going to get out of here,
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; We've got to do more than we've ever
[1:42:54] done before.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; To get out of here.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; But this is the last This is the This is
[1:43:00] the last course that we're going to
[1:43:01] take. I just believe this year is going
[1:43:04] to show who's going to make it and who's
[1:43:06] not. And I just pray by the by the word
[1:43:09] of the Lord and the prayer of faith that
[1:43:11] we're all going to make it.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; And we're going to preach our heart out
[1:43:14] starting in January, January 25th. And
[1:43:16] we're going to really try to uh to break
[1:43:19] those seals down because without that,
[1:43:21] we will not have the redemption of our
[1:43:23] body.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; We'll all just keep getting older and
[1:43:26] dying and going by the grave. And you
[1:43:27] can believe that if you want to. It's
[1:43:29] just come to me that it doesn't matter
[1:43:31] what you believe.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; It's what God tells us and we believe
[1:43:36] him. Amen. That's right.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; Our own opinion from now on has got us
[1:43:40] nowhere.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Our opinions is what got us killed.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; So, let's take his opinion because it's
[1:43:51] always right.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Never is wrong.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; He'll never steer you in the wrong
[1:43:56] direction. So, let's live our sermon
[1:43:58] though. Let's live our Christianity this
[1:44:00] year.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; Let's live our faith.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; You know, that's what the guy said. He's
[1:44:06] just He said, "Well, I'm faithful."
[1:44:09] I said, "Faithful to what?
[1:44:12] If that's all we got to live for is the
[1:44:14] way those guys live. I mean, come on.
[1:44:17] There's life after this.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; There's real life after this. This But
[1:44:22] we got to go through this.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; This is our testing ground. This is our
[1:44:25] place that we got to come to to get out
[1:44:28] of here."
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; And he gave us the message to do it
[1:44:32] with.
[1:44:34] There's no other message that's going to
[1:44:35] change our body. Not other another
[1:44:37] message. There's not a denomination.
[1:44:39] There's not anything in this world going
[1:44:40] to change our body except the bride
[1:44:42] accepting what he sent through a prophet
[1:44:45] and God revealing that to us
[1:44:47] individually,
[1:44:49] but together we can what? We can worship
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; that God's in our midst.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; So, we love you and appreciate you. miss
[1:44:55] you this weekend and and uh we were um
[1:44:58] watching in and we we appreciate the uh
[1:45:01] time God gave us to kind of study a
[1:45:03] little bit on how to what direction to
[1:45:05] go in when we start there in January.
[1:45:08] And I pray that we'll all
[1:45:11] all
[1:45:13] from this day forward
[1:45:16] think of God more often. Think of think
[1:45:18] of just sit down and think. Maybe
[1:45:20] sometimes maybe we do need to just sit
[1:45:22] down in a in a place. You don't have to
[1:45:24] sit in a deer stand, but sit in a place
[1:45:25] somewhere and just just reflect on what
[1:45:28] God's done for you.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; And then reflect on what he can do for
[1:45:32] you more
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; than he's done for you before.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz he have he he can. Brother Ram
[1:45:38] said, "Ask for big things." So this year
[1:45:40] we're going to ask God for big things.
[1:45:42] Amen.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; We're going to ask for our family.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; We're going to ask for our wayward loved
[1:45:45] ones. We're going to ask for all these
[1:45:46] things. And we're going to ask expecting
[1:45:48] that that's going to take place in God's
[1:45:51] time. not our time, but in God's time.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; So, God bless you. Let's uh bow our
[1:45:55] heads and we'll dismiss in a word of
[1:45:56] prayer. Just remember this weekend be
[1:45:58] with brother Luis and speak in a word.
[1:45:59] I'll be speaking next Wednesday. Uh Lord
[1:46:02] willing. So, just pray for us as we go
[1:46:03] to brother Richards and have a a weekend
[1:46:05] with them. So, dear heavenly father,
[1:46:07] Lord, what a sermon. Lord, thank you so
[1:46:11] much, Lord, for our brother pouring his
[1:46:12] heart out, Lord, that we need those
[1:46:14] spiritual vitamins, Lord. And the only
[1:46:16] way we're going to get them is we're
[1:46:17] going to have to put them in our mouth.
[1:46:19] And Lord,
[1:46:21] out of this word,
[1:46:24] we're going to have what it takes to get
[1:46:25] us out of here. It'll be that vitamin
[1:46:28] that'll change our body. But Lord, we
[1:46:31] won't. If we don't take it, it will do
[1:46:33] us no good. We must take the vitamin
[1:46:36] before it can do us any good. Father,
[1:46:38] just be with each one. I know we got
[1:46:39] sick among us. Mom over there, you know,
[1:46:41] with a strep throat. Father, I pray that
[1:46:43] you'd be with her, Lord. She wasn't here
[1:46:44] tonight with us. But, Lord, that we can
[1:46:46] all overcome these things, the little
[1:46:48] things that are bothering us, Lord, and
[1:46:49] we'll kick those things out the door and
[1:46:51] start this new year, Lord, Lord, more
[1:46:54] dedicated to you, Father. Because there
[1:46:57] will come a time where there's going to
[1:46:58] be a rapture. And there's going to be a
[1:47:01] time, Lord, where we have to come to a
[1:47:02] place to where we believe you more than
[1:47:06] even our own body because it all is
[1:47:09] denying you, Lord. But father, that one
[1:47:12] thing inside of us, that eternal life,
[1:47:14] that new birth, Lord, it never will deny
[1:47:16] you. It will always agree with the word.
[1:47:19] Amen.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; And Father, just I pray that all that
[1:47:22] will come for come come forward this
[1:47:23] year, Lord, and that we'll live a
[1:47:25] better, more uh productive Christian
[1:47:27] life, Father. Just be with the people,
[1:47:29] Father, on the way home. Bless each one,
[1:47:30] Lord, as they go back to school and they
[1:47:33] go back to work, Lord. Just be with them
[1:47:35] and bless them, Father. just continue to
[1:47:37] be with the church here, Father, and the
[1:47:39] ones listening in, Lord, from all over
[1:47:41] the world. Lord, I pray that you'd be
[1:47:42] with them, Father. Bless us now in Jesus
[1:47:44] name. Amen. God bless you. You're
[1:47:46] dismissed.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; So glad I'm yours,
[1:47:51] Lord.
[1:47:53] So glad I'm yours, Lord.
[1:47:59] So glad your mercy
[1:48:05] has followed me.
[1:48:11] I'm so glad you found me
[1:48:17] and you set me free.
[1:48:24] So glad I'm yours,
[1:48:27] Lord.
[1:48:30] So glad I'm yours.
