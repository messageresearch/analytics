[2:10] subject this morning that kind of hit me
[2:13] yall I don't know how long it be I don't
[2:15] believe will be that long but uh
[2:17] something has been really burning my
[2:20] heart um the last couple of weeks on
[2:23] some things that uh has has come about
[2:26] that we U I don't know how how your
[2:30] Journeys has been but they all we all
[2:32] have to be the same and it has to be
[2:34] around the Lord and one of the first
[2:36] scriptures that really come to my heart
[2:38] that Brother D was preaching about I
[2:40] don't know probably four or five years
[2:41] ago maybe six that Romans 8:11 and he
[2:45] spoke of it and U I really didn't
[2:48] understand a lot then and I still don't
[2:50] still uh always looking for the Lord to
[2:52] come on the scene and going hey it's
[2:54] like this you know hit you on the back
[2:56] of the head and say this is the way it
[2:57] really is I don't know how he does y'all
[2:59] but that's the way does me and uh I want
[3:01] to speak on some things that brother
[3:03] brandham brought about U get back to
[3:06] Romans 8 right quick but
[3:09] um let me get into this one thing that
[3:16] uh brother Bram was talking about uh
[3:20] where's that in the Hebrews book here we
[3:22] go I was going to read this last but I'm
[3:24] going to go ahead and read it first cuz
[3:25] I really like the title the way it works
[3:27] it says U Hebrews book chapter 4
[3:32] Jeffersonville Indiana Sunday
[3:37] 57091 evening
[3:39] service 151 187 now
[3:43] watch that was the third rest he
[3:47] gave the first God received it from his
[3:51] work the second Israel received it in
[3:54] the law and the Third Church received it
[3:57] as a part of God three is the number of
[4:00] Life how many knows that every time you
[4:02] see three it's life notice when God
[4:05] created the Earth on the third day was
[4:07] life how many knows that the third day
[4:10] there came life on the third day of
[4:13] creation the Trinity the father was was
[4:16] above the people in a pillar of fire the
[4:18] son was a man who talked to uh people
[4:22] and got them ready the Holy Ghost was a
[4:24] third step which was the Holy Ghost God
[4:28] in the people
[4:30] life Father and Son the rest of God the
[4:32] rest of Israel and the rest of the
[4:34] church the Sabbath keeping I really like
[4:38] that because uh not to play with numbers
[4:42] or say that anyone numb is better than
[4:44] another numbers that this this point
[4:46] here he makes with the number three and
[4:49] he says that uh God perfects in threes
[4:52] and he does cuz about everything we run
[4:55] into uh in the scripture I could sit
[4:57] here and it's like uh
[5:00] brother Joe on on his what he does on
[5:02] the light I mean it's that's just part
[5:05] of of his demonstration to us of
[5:09] revealing himself to us uh who we are I
[5:13] want to go back to uh right now Romans 8
[5:17] and uh Romans 8:11 but if the spirit of
[5:21] him that raised up Jesus from the
[5:25] dead dwell in you he that raised up
[5:28] Christ from the dead shall also Quicken
[5:30] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[5:33] dwelleth in you uh there was a point
[5:36] that in in past just while back I'm not
[5:40] going to bring it up but within this
[5:42] context that uh what I witnessed the
[5:45] last couple of weeks about that same
[5:47] scripture God gave me a furtherment of
[5:49] it and also a furtherment of by his
[5:53] stripes were healed and I've seen that
[5:56] to me God was sitting there and he he
[5:58] revealed it to me me as something was
[6:00] happening in my life was very dear and
[6:01] close to me a passing of my dad that I
[6:04] could sit there and watch and I mean it
[6:07] was I'm sorry folks I was sitting there
[6:09] and I watched it and I seen it and the
[6:10] Lord just come right out and he said
[6:11] this is it this is uh you know it's it's
[6:15] not time right and so he's he's got to
[6:17] pass on over he won't suffer no more and
[6:20] and here's your scripture let me bring
[6:22] it back to you if the spirit is in us
[6:26] that raised up Christ Jesus Christ Lord
[6:29] and Savior our
[6:31] creator and all of us we have to look
[6:34] and see and know that hey if you ain't
[6:37] got it you better be real busy trying to
[6:39] figure out how to get it because without
[6:43] the new birth and that's the only way
[6:45] that can come to
[6:46] you we're just going to be sitting
[6:48] around and be left behind I ain't going
[6:51] to be left behind Lord willing wasz I do
[6:54] anything I could to be sure that I got
[6:57] that and everything God giv me is just
[7:00] wonderful but I noticed that in my times
[7:02] past things ain't as like they used to
[7:05] be it's longer and longer that he comes
[7:07] and and uh and and does these things
[7:09] like that to me and quickens things to
[7:11] me but anyway as I sitting there and you
[7:14] see this uh that's passing and and it's
[7:19] you know you know what's happening the
[7:20] body's going in One Direction the spirit
[7:22] and the soul is the spirit's done gone
[7:25] out the life is gone out and you sit
[7:27] there and you look and you go well well
[7:30] there's got to be more than this than
[7:31] that I mean a Christian don't just die
[7:33] they lay there asleep their body just
[7:36] literally goes to sleep and they they
[7:38] move on and uh he as I was sitting there
[7:41] God said now there's more to this than
[7:43] that you can see now his healing you
[7:47] know that I've taught you and I've told
[7:50] you that he's already over there and
[7:52] he's having he's having fun right now
[7:55] about a 20-year-old and he's he's over
[7:57] there with Mama he's over I can see him
[7:59] over talking to brother brandom hey what
[8:01] did you think when this big old guy come
[8:02] down and I mean I heard what you said
[8:04] but what did you really think or or who
[8:06] knows you know he I'm sure with him he
[8:08] was over there just talking to a lot of
[8:10] people cuz I was over there picking up
[8:11] his books and listen he had four or five
[8:14] books on Christ mystery God reveal uh
[8:17] Jesus Christ same day yesterday and and
[8:19] forever and he' went back to them and he
[8:21] just wrote all this stuff in them each
[8:23] one of them and there were like every
[8:25] one of them some of them he repeated it
[8:27] but other he went back and and it's just
[8:30] like you're sitting there reading all
[8:31] this and you see all this take place and
[8:34] you go okay there's got to be more
[8:36] Romans 811 that spirit is going to stay
[8:39] there with him until the day that is
[8:41] redeemed and God does a plan does
[8:44] redemption in threes we all know that um
[8:48] and Romans 8 to me come on down to where
[8:51] you see that if you got the spirit in
[8:53] you you already got it in you that's
[8:55] your new birth then there's three stages
[8:57] right in here in Romans uh I think it's
[9:00] Romans
[9:01] uh where is it uh led by the spirit
[9:05] that's the second phase there's three
[9:06] phases to the
[9:08] adoption right there's three phases to
[9:12] adoption and number one is uh if you got
[9:15] the spirit that's the new birth number
[9:16] two uh you're led by the spirit that's
[9:19] where U that's stage two and which is
[9:23] the spirit of adoption is whereby you
[9:25] cry have a father uh then you go over to
[9:28] uh
[9:30] I'm I'm just going to kind of jump
[9:31] around here but you go to verse 23
[9:34] Romans 8:23 and that's the uh the first
[9:37] fruits of course the Redemption of the
[9:40] body and uh that's the part we got to
[9:42] get to right is that and uh I wanted to
[9:46] uh go on into the uh three stages of
[9:51] redemption so is uh the first is of
[9:55] course the Earth was Noah was justified
[9:59] and uh Noah was there and and the Earth
[10:02] was justified by water course Noah had
[10:04] three sons to repopulate the Earth and
[10:07] to take the number three on down the
[10:09] line when Jesus was laying there in the
[10:11] manger here come three wise men from
[10:14] three different parts of the world
[10:15] following that one star that one little
[10:17] light they didn't know each other
[10:20] different uh uh how do you say it
[10:23] different backgrounds uh different
[10:26] heritages that they had come out of like
[10:28] come out of the Wilderness and they come
[10:30] right there and here he is uh those same
[10:32] three come right back after what 2,000
[10:35] more years here they come the lineages
[10:37] come right back to Christ as he's laying
[10:39] there's a little baby and manger and uh
[10:42] anyway the
[10:44] uh uh also Noah done something else that
[10:47] I I've really he sent out three files
[10:49] and the Raven went one way he he wasn't
[10:52] to be predicted but he did send out the
[10:54] two doves and uh to bring to keep in
[10:57] line with what I'm talking about here
[10:58] with the number number three I'm going
[10:59] to go on to uh the second time uh for
[11:02] the Earth Jesus of course Sanctified it
[11:06] with his blood we all know that and uh
[11:09] Jesus he never uh he always had his
[11:12] three Witnesses with him he had Peter
[11:15] James and John and uh I love that uh in
[11:19] in second Peter I'm not sure if it's
[11:21] second Peter 25 or where it is that uh
[11:24] he's talking about
[11:27] uh he has a more word of Prophecy and
[11:30] here's Peter stood there and seen
[11:33] actually physically seen this U
[11:37] uh transformation if you would that uh
[11:41] Jesus was there and here comes Moses and
[11:43] Elijah talking to him and he seen three
[11:46] and of course he naturally wanted to go
[11:48] back be build three temples I know I
[11:50] mean three three places of worship you
[11:53] know but God was always kind of getting
[11:57] after Peter about some things cuz Peter
[11:58] was was always kind of strong on that
[12:01] and uh the
[12:03] uh uh
[12:09] the the three Witnesses was there with
[12:12] him and uh I wanted to read a section
[12:15] about Peter uh Peter James and John it's
[12:18] a it's
[12:19] a the prophet brought it out about them
[12:23] I right here this uh faith is a
[12:26] substance in Oakland California on a
[12:29] Saturday in 1947 it was
[12:33] 0412 and look at Peter when he was
[12:36] walking by why he was a
[12:39] moral he was born of sinful flesh like
[12:44] you or just like I or you that's right
[12:48] but the people had need of a
[12:51] Healer so they sent God sent Peter to do
[12:54] that specific work John was led Peter
[12:58] didn't have the love in his heart that
[13:01] John had John was God's ageny of love
[13:05] you see look here when he taken Peter
[13:09] James and John hope faith and charity
[13:12] don't you see those gift gifted people
[13:16] them three the hope faith and charity
[13:18] Hope was in James he was the one that
[13:22] set the church in
[13:23] order faith in Peter and charity was in
[13:27] John hope faith and charity it was God's
[13:30] Representatives on the earth and the
[13:33] people laid in Peter's Shadow and were
[13:37] healed oh friends oh my don't think I'm
[13:40] yelling at you friends you you might uh
[13:43] think I'm excited but I'm not I'm trying
[13:45] to get my point to you uh close enough
[13:48] you'll see what I'm talking about um so
[13:52] he had the three Witnesses with him at
[13:54] all times and that's a a wonderful thing
[13:58] because like I said
[14:01] uh to the title I I could sit here and
[14:03] go on and on about the threes Shadrach M
[14:07] and abedo Lord use them right there um
[14:11] of course it's the three works of Grace
[14:13] in our everyday life that we all seek
[14:15] out and look for and uh then of course
[14:18] the coming of the Prophet with the three
[14:20] pulls of the healing the discernment
[14:22] then the open of the word to us um what
[14:25] a what a great thing this that God is
[14:28] doing for for and uh he's doing it he's
[14:31] perfecting Us in
[14:32] threes and U I want to get on to the the
[14:36] last section of the the stages of the
[14:39] Redemption uh we had the Earth and then
[14:41] we've had Jesus sanctifying it by his
[14:43] blood the Earth justified by the water
[14:46] and then of course we got Armageddon
[14:47] which is the termination of forces and U
[14:51] I really didn't want to get a whole lot
[14:53] into that because most of that's in the
[14:55] six seal to me of course it's all in
[14:57] there together but uh it's the
[14:59] termination of the forces there and uh
[15:03] then you come back in to the that's one
[15:07] stage of redemption the second stage of
[15:09] redemption is our natural births that we
[15:12] come uh out of the creation of God we're
[15:16] we're
[15:18] U we're a gene of man we we we come in a
[15:23] sinle state uh we need Redemption
[15:27] um um some of my notes are real small
[15:30] and I can't hardly read cuz I was
[15:31] writing them this morning about 3:00
[15:33] y'all forgive
[15:35] me but anyway we we need a new birth
[15:39] we're born in sful state and we we
[15:41] project the negative and uh then of
[15:44] course uh you come to the the third
[15:47] stage of this thing which is the new
[15:48] birth uh we're Justified that that man
[15:52] is Justified Sanctified and has received
[15:55] the baptism of the Holy Ghost U he is uh
[15:59] the gene of God he's Heavenly is
[16:01] theophany is perfect mortal uh Immortal
[16:05] is U sinless he uh lives by the word uh
[16:11] is written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[16:15] uh and he possesses the Zoey life and uh
[16:21] it's the real you so
[16:27] Isaiah
[16:29] said that we we look at numbers and I
[16:32] want to say that uh the number seven God
[16:36] displays y'all all know that right
[16:39] that's 70 displays it's like the the the
[16:43] the church ages seals and things like
[16:46] that are strictly a display for us but
[16:48] God always perfects in the
[16:50] threes um and I wanted to whoops tell
[16:55] the
[16:56] clock pardon me
[16:59] uh I wanted to read Ephesians 3:9 and 21
[17:03] and I'm going to let
[17:05] us go on up
[17:11] because
[17:27] it
[17:36] also want to tell you about three types
[17:38] of people as y'all already know that uh
[17:40] this is uh Hebrews part one Jefferson uh
[17:44] uh in the Cod Wednesday
[17:48] 57092 now let me have something here
[17:51] just show you a little something so you
[17:53] won't forget it going to make you a
[17:56] little
[17:57] illustration I I'm going to put how
[18:00] many um Jer nationalities of people are
[18:04] there in the world and there's three ham
[18:07] sham and japa going back to the the
[18:11] three that had to go out and repopulate
[18:13] after the flood how many know that we
[18:17] came from those three sons of Noah Ham's
[18:20] people shem's people and people is
[18:22] the Anglo-Saxon shim's people is the the
[18:26] three generations that's Jew Gentile and
[18:29] half Jew and Gentile now
[18:32] notice when there and this is ham sham
[18:35] and
[18:36] those are three types of people that
[18:39] Prophet was talking about
[18:42] uh also I want to read
[18:47] the
[18:53] okay we talk right here that uh hear his
[18:57] voice Jeffersonville and and Sunday on U
[19:00] 1958 10:05 a.m. the three stages of of
[19:03] everything there's a stage of the moral
[19:06] body The Immortal body and the glorified
[19:09] body that's three stages of the body uh
[19:13] see just like other things like father
[19:15] son and and uh Holy Spirit goes in one
[19:19] one channel and the three makes the one
[19:21] justification sanctification baptism of
[19:24] the holy ghost in a channel makes the
[19:26] one and the soul body
[19:29] and the spirit makes the one and it
[19:31] travels in threes and threes are one and
[19:35] take a three cornered I love this part
[19:39] take a three three cornered piece of
[19:41] glass and lay it in the
[19:43] sun it'll reflect colors yet seven
[19:48] colors will come down to
[19:50] one and you take red and look through
[19:53] red at Red how many knows what red it'll
[19:58] be be
[20:00] white uh isn't that strange that red
[20:03] through red looks
[20:06] white red is the sign of redemption and
[20:09] when you God looks at you your red sins
[20:13] through the red blood of his precious
[20:14] son they're white see so but he has to
[20:19] look through the blood if it doesn't
[20:22] they are sinful so we have to be under
[20:25] the
[20:26] blood and
[20:28] demonology uh first
[20:31] physical connorville
[20:34] Indiana uh d2140 Monday
[20:38] 53608 a.m. now watch this cell let's say
[20:42] for instance like a hot lot of time the
[20:45] red cancer usually hits in the womb of a
[20:49] woman female bruises and so forth now
[20:51] that let's take that and that fellow
[20:54] down on the cells that's
[20:57] cancer let me get on down here to this
[21:00] uh now a cancer everything in the
[21:02] natural types A Spiritual are you aware
[21:04] of that everything in the natural types
[21:06] of spiritual regardless for instance
[21:09] like this when when we're born in the
[21:12] body of Christ there's three elements
[21:13] that takes to bring our
[21:16] birth and that's the three elements that
[21:18] come out of the Life of Christ when he
[21:21] died there come from his body water
[21:24] blood and spirit is that right three
[21:26] elements that's the elements we go
[21:29] through when we're born again
[21:30] justification sanctification baptism the
[21:32] Holy Spirit now that we all be in one
[21:35] act but it takes but you but you can be
[21:38] in a Justified State without being
[21:41] Sanctified you can believe on the Lord
[21:44] Jesus Christ and still carry your filth
[21:46] with you but you can absolutely live in
[21:50] in a both Justified and a clean body or
[21:53] clean holy life and without the Holy
[21:55] Ghost see the Bible First John 5:7 said
[21:59] there are three that bear record in
