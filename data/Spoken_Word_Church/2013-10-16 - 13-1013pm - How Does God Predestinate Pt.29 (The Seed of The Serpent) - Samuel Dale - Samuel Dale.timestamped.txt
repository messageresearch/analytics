[18:48] we ask you to forgive our sins cleanse

[18:55] loving grace in Jesus name amen
[18:59] Romans
[19:01] 8
[19:05] 28-31 and we know that all things work
[19:07] together for good to them that love God
[19:09] to them who are the called according to
[19:11] his purpose for whom he did for know he
[19:14] also did
[19:16] predestinate to be conformed to the
[19:18] image of his son that he might be the
[19:20] firstborn among many Brethren moreover
[19:23] whom he did predestinate them he also
[19:25] called and whom he called the he also
[19:28] Justified and whom he justified them he
[19:31] also glorified what shall we then say to
[19:34] these things to all of these statements
[19:36] above what can we say if God be for us
[19:39] who can be against us right amen let's
[19:42] go over to Genesis now and we'll begin
[19:45] reading in Genesis
[19:50] 3 and try to pick up our thought from
[19:52] this
[19:53] morning and move right on
[19:57] in
[20:01] and the now the serpent was more subtle
[20:03] than any beast of the field which the
[20:04] Lord God had made and he said unto the
[20:07] woman yay hath God said You shall not
[20:10] eat of every tree of the
[20:12] garden and the woman said unto the
[20:15] serpent we may eat of the fruit of the
[20:17] Trees of the garden but the fruit of the
[20:19] tree which is in the midst of the garden
[20:21] God ha said ye shall not eat of it
[20:24] neither shall you touch it lest you die
[20:26] the serpent said unto the woman and you
[20:28] shall not surely die for God do know
[20:31] that in the day you eat thereof then
[20:33] your eyes shall be open and you shall be
[20:35] as God's knowing good and evil let's
[20:39] just stop there because we may not get
[20:42] down to the rest of it uh the next two
[20:45] verses but you may be seated the Lord
[20:46] add his Blessing to the reading of the
[20:57] word so we're trying and endeavoring to
[21:01] speak
[21:02] about to you and I to get us in a better
[21:05] understanding of how does God
[21:09] predestinate all right we've had all
[21:11] kind of church allies and manies and
[21:14] theologies about that down through the
[21:17] uh time and all but uh you know getting
[21:21] down to the end where the word is being
[21:24] revealed then we see that we get get to
[21:28] an understanding how does God
[21:30] predestinate by his full knowledge
[21:33] that's simple too simple for us to stop
[21:37] and anchor our whole life our whole
[21:40] being upon that thought you know it's
[21:43] too much because we want to figure out
[21:46] things that's the point we were getting
[21:48] at this morning and and I wonder why
[21:51] that you know that I speak the way I do
[21:53] and try to cover it uh and keep going
[21:56] over and over it because
[21:59] maybe it's
[22:00] needful
[22:02] but we need an understanding by
[22:05] Revelation instead of a head
[22:07] knowledge head knowledge is fine that's
[22:10] great but we need it revealed to us and
[22:13] it takes the Holy Spirit to reveal the
[22:15] word you know man cannot reveal the word
[22:18] to you and I even Jesus himself said my
[22:21] own life didn't show that unto thee
[22:23] speaking to Peter he said but the father
[22:25] he revealed it all right so then no man
[22:28] can reveal anything so we just do the
[22:30] best we can talking about the Lord and
[22:33] and and things that we see and we let
[22:35] him speak uh to our hearts and our lives
[22:39] and our doings but now as I said we we
[22:42] understand
[22:44] that God's forn knowledge is a wonderful
[22:47] thing and it looks down through and
[22:49] Before Time Ever began he could look
[22:52] down through and see the beginning the
[22:54] end all of the things if we don't
[22:56] believe that to be true then what kind
[22:58] of a god do we have you know what are we
[23:00] talking about but we believe that he's
[23:03] totally infinite which means he knows
[23:05] all things so then we don't have to
[23:08] worry about uh you know we we're not
[23:11] trying to pull anything over on him and
[23:13] and a thoughts like that in our mind
[23:15] because we believe he's God and he
[23:16] changes not all right then being that
[23:19] then he Reveals His word to you and
[23:22] I and that makes us his children his
[23:26] offspring and he before the world knew
[23:29] that we would desire to be saved so he
[23:32] would have it here for us all right
[23:34] that's simple terminology simple
[23:37] thoughts of doing it so then we could
[23:39] look at
[23:40] predestination without being mly
[23:42] confused you know well God predestinated
[23:45] this to be so there's no way I can't
[23:47] change it well you know if that's what
[23:51] you believe about it you might as well
[23:53] go ahead cuz you can't change it anyway
[23:55] cuz you're not going to change his mind
[23:58] no matter what we try to change it ain't
[23:59] going to change God's mind he saw it
[24:02] before the world he
[24:03] predestines not by even his own desires
[24:06] because he desired that everybody be
[24:08] saved according to the Bible all right
[24:11] but he predestines according to our to
[24:13] his for knowledge of what we will do all
[24:16] right then getting to that then we can
[24:18] see as we were trying to cover this
[24:20] morning that he knew that if he created
[24:24] Lucifer Satan uh the anointed jerb
[24:28] all of the titles you want to give
[24:31] him he knew if he gave him free moral
[24:35] agency which is the right to choose you
[24:37] know he knew Satan would
[24:41] fall so in that doing he allowed him to
[24:44] do that and Satan as we talked about the
[24:47] anointed cherub he pulled a third of the
[24:49] stars of Heaven together around his
[24:52] Doctrine his
[24:54] idea and and he had to be cast out of
[24:57] heaven according to Revelations 12 when
[25:00] he did he came to Earth and when he came
[25:03] to Earth don't worry about playing
[25:05] around with the devil either cuz he
[25:07] remember he started off the anointed
[25:10] cherub so even uh who was it um
[25:17] Gabriel Gabriel and trying to come to
[25:19] Daniel couldn't come why because Satan
[25:24] was there to hinder that's how powerful
[25:26] he is all
[25:28] so he had to send Michael to take care
[25:31] of Lucifer Satan where Gabriel could
[25:34] come on to Daniel all right so don't
[25:37] think you can pull anything over on the
[25:39] devil either that's right right about
[25:42] the time you think you got him figured
[25:43] out you just found out he you ain't
[25:45] figuring him too good he he's he's he's
[25:48] a smart fell but I believe the Holy
[25:53] Spirit I believe the Holy Spirit can
[25:56] tell us about the devil in his ways and
[25:59] that's what I'm trying to do to talk
[26:01] about the fall in the garden and what
[26:04] took
[26:05] place and seeing that Paul was concerned
[26:10] there in
[26:12] Corinthians that you know that Satan
[26:15] through his subtility 2 Corinthians
[26:20] 11:3 that he would deceive us like he
[26:24] did Eve all right don't ever think that
[26:27] you you yourself are a match for the
[26:31] devil and you're not to consider that
[26:33] thought it should never enter our minds
[26:36] cuz about the time you think that you're
[26:38] smarter than the devil remember he's got
[26:41] you because that's the wisdom so we
[26:44] trust the holy
[26:46] spirit amen the Holy Spirit the devil is
[26:50] no match for the holy spirit all right
[26:52] so we trust him to tell us but now
[26:56] remember the way that I always try to
[26:58] explain things a caral you know a carnal
[27:01] way but just remember if you think
[27:05] you're smarter than the devil you're
[27:07] already right in the middle of his
[27:09] trap he's already got you confused right
[27:13] all right so there's no need of ever
[27:15] trying to do that just just go on and
[27:17] accept it and let God uh speak to us and
[27:21] lead us in the correct way okay now
[27:24] trying to back up a little bit to to
[27:27] where we can can get a better
[27:29] understanding and
[27:32] watch God knew also that if he gave Adam
[27:36] and Eve a
[27:38] choice the greatest way he could create
[27:40] them was perfect and that's what they
[27:43] were all right but yet in all of
[27:48] that they did
[27:50] fall now you say but but Eve was the
[27:54] only one that failed well you better
[27:56] remember
[27:58] Adam's Once Sold a human race
[28:01] right the Bible says in Adam all die
[28:04] right it doesn't say in Eve Eve Eve was
[28:08] the one used to bring about the Fallen
[28:10] condition yes but Adam was not deceived
[28:14] the Bible said that's what made him in
[28:17] trouble Eve was deceived she thought she
[28:20] was
[28:20] right but Adam was not deceived he knew
[28:24] exactly what he was doing and he knew
[28:27] when he took
[28:29] Eve that he was selling the human race
[28:32] into Satan's hands right so then don't
[28:35] blame Eve for all of
[28:38] it just get down to the point that what
[28:41] I like to do is what I was trying to do
[28:43] this morning and what I've been trying
[28:45] to do two or three services and and I
[28:47] reckon it's meant for me to just stay on
[28:49] this a little is to get us to
[28:55] understand now I don't believe believe
[28:57] you can be a born again
[28:59] Christian and never be lost now truly
[29:01] born again Christian I believe you can
[29:04] repent of your sins you can do things
[29:05] and all but if you're ever truly born
[29:09] again you you won't be lost all right
[29:14] but don't ever get it in your mind that
[29:15] you can't do
[29:18] wrong when you do the devil's got
[29:22] you well I can't do wrong well then you
[29:25] go out and do wrong who you going to
[29:26] blame to doing wrong on
[29:28] you know well the devil made me do it
[29:31] well like the prophet of God said he
[29:34] said you went out to
[29:36] him he can't come in where you're at so
[29:40] just remember that in our thoughts
[29:42] because that's what I'm W us to
[29:46] see that what
[29:48] caused Satan to get kicked out of heaven
[29:53] was he begin to reason that's right he
[29:56] begin to build build himself up in his
[29:59] thinking he began to want to be the the
[30:03] to take over he wanted to do it he was
[30:07] over the worship
[30:09] service in heaven
[30:12] well that's why he loves good music and
[30:15] good singing I do too enjoy the sister
[30:18] singing I love good music I believe God
[30:21] does but the devil
[30:24] does he ain't out in The Honky tongs
[30:26] today no he's sitting up here the front
[30:29] row and this side's empty so he's got
[30:31] his own Pew right up here and uh you
[30:34] know he wants to be where the people of
[30:38] God is
[30:39] at because he enjoys that he he's not
[30:41] out in The Honky Tong he doesn't got
[30:43] that he wants to be here and like I was
[30:46] talking yesterday with
[30:48] somebody when the you watch the young
[30:51] men come along in this message
[30:53] especially and they they begin to move
[30:55] and they get great followings and things
[30:57] just leave them alone a little while let
[30:59] them go after a while they'll either
[31:02] settle down and get straightened out or
[31:04] they'll just run on off and take some of
[31:06] them with them you know because that's
[31:08] the way it does see everybody wants to
[31:10] flock after some new
[31:12] thing you know some new idea some new
[31:16] doctrine well that's what Satan's
[31:19] doing that's that's the point now the
[31:22] last two or three services that I'm
[31:23] trying to drive into me and
[31:26] you
[31:27] I don't say anything about you listening
[31:29] to these other brothers and things you
[31:32] know these other
[31:33] ministers but the only thing I tell you
[31:35] is
[31:37] what listen to what they're saying check
[31:40] it out with the
[31:43] message and see whether it's right or
[31:46] not it's a good thought that's
[31:51] wonderful but what good is it if it's a
[31:53] wrong
[31:54] thought but it's like I tell you then I
[31:57] I don't have any problem but now when
[31:58] you then bring that back
[32:01] here among the congregation and I see
[32:05] you outside sneaking off in little
[32:08] groups and yakking
[32:11] away and uh talking about what you've
[32:14] heard so and so say that's good if it's
[32:19] right but if it's wrong then I'll say
[32:21] something about it from here because
[32:23] that's my job right and you know the way
[32:26] I know that you know how that I can tell
[32:27] you I don't have discernment I got
[32:32] sense did that work out all I got to do
[32:36] is just there's brother dick and brother
[32:38] Mark and they're just yaking away and I
[32:41] walk up and they
[32:44] go what yall talking oh we wasn't
[32:46] talking about nothing we wouldn't
[32:48] talking about
[32:49] nothing I know I done run into one of
[32:51] them little doctrines that they're
[32:52] trying to spread you know right among
[32:55] the people you know so I'll say
[32:57] something about it when I get a chance
[33:00] but
[33:02] listen whatever you would think about
[33:05] the literal happening in the garden you
[33:09] know we know something did happen and we
[33:11] believe we know what did happen all
[33:14] right we don't believe ate Eve ate an
[33:16] apple because you pass out apples all
[33:18] day and it don't make nobody find out
[33:20] they're
[33:21] naked all right
[33:25] but you can look at that and say well
[33:27] that was the seed of the
[33:31] serpent
[33:33] brother
[33:35] uh Bob and Joe just put that on there
[33:37] this evening seed of the serpent is the
[33:40] title I give them titles as we go along
[33:43] and everything else there's something
[33:44] back there running okay what is the seed
[33:47] of the serpent well it was Eve and the
[33:50] Beast no no
[33:53] now that only produced The Seed of the
[33:55] Beast
[33:59] right and the Beast didn't have no soul
[34:01] he didn't have no ability he was just
[34:03] used of
[34:05] Satan but the main thing is the seed of
[34:07] The
[34:08] Serpent and that's what Paul was
[34:11] cautioning us
[34:12] about lest he through his
[34:15] subtility deceive us like he did Eve
[34:18] through the
[34:20] Simplicity that is in
[34:22] Christ the Simplicity of knowing the
[34:25] truth you know the Bible teachings of
[34:29] the truth and in that see Satan then
[34:32] comes in and he
[34:34] just little wordings he didn't jump on
[34:37] Eve all at once and just you
[34:40] know thing go wrong there's no telling
[34:43] how long that he spent talking to
[34:49] her he got her to
[34:52] reason as the prophet of God
[34:54] said all right he said well we shouldn't
[34:57] reason no we shouldn't reason about
[34:59] God's
[35:00] word he said well you quoted this
[35:02] morning come let us reason that's right
[35:04] come let us reason with God right not
[35:08] with one another all right so Eve as she
[35:12] begin to
[35:13] reason she accepted Satan's
[35:16] lie and how close was that
[35:21] lie we deal with that he only changed
[35:24] one word in the lital old scripture you
[35:27] know shall die he said shall not we talk
[35:32] about that's how simple it
[35:34] was but I'm talking about how close the
[35:38] truth
[35:40] is and what Satan's doing in the end
[35:44] time and how close the truth really is
[35:49] right if it was one word that caused all
[35:53] of
[35:55] this then
[35:57] how's it going to be with all of this in
[36:00] the end
[36:01] time this bombarding you and I in the
[36:05] things trying to give us new
[36:09] light you know this is not new
[36:13] light the message of the Prophet was not
[36:16] new light that's right you remember the
[36:19] other week we were talking about that
[36:20] and let him say it he said this is the
[36:23] oldest Doctrine that's ever been that's
[36:25] right this end time
[36:28] message was the oldest Doctrine that's
[36:30] ever been because it's the
[36:33] truth right so that's the oldest
[36:37] Doctrine see it started up in heaven we
[36:39] spent a long time back there before
[36:42] coming down to earth with our message
[36:46] all right so
[36:49] then the fall was not the physical
[36:54] act as much as it was
[36:57] the spiritual act in the mind of Eve
[37:03] right he knew how to get to her
[37:07] mind see we spend all of the time
[37:10] wanting to try to prove that well Eve
[37:13] was made different than
[37:17] Adam anybody knows
[37:20] that all you got to do is look at the
[37:23] door on the they still got it there look
[37:26] on the door to bathrooms you know and
[37:28] one of them got a dress on the other got
[37:30] on pants there any problem with being
[37:32] able to look and see that there's a
[37:34] difference between a man and a woman you
[37:37] know that's the only thing we dealing
[37:41] with we want to talk about the seed of
[37:43] the serpent well you
[37:47] know well it was just a sex
[37:50] act when even the
[37:54] beast but now my Point's always been one
[37:57] thing do you mean to tell me that Eve
[38:00] had a husband if she'd had any problems
[38:03] and we know that wasn't developing at
[38:05] that time trying not to talk too
[38:09] plain
[38:12] but why would she receive a
[38:18] beast yeah
[38:21] that's that ought to be enough to let
[38:23] you know a lot of things she was greatly
[38:26] fastly
[38:28] deceived before the literal act took
[38:32] place she had already
[38:35] accepted in her
[38:37] mind what the other things would
[38:42] be but she got that from Satan and his
[38:46] knowledge his wisdom his
[38:50] understanding you remember the prophet
[38:52] of God said that he had a knowledge of
[38:54] the principles of life yeah so he knew
[38:57] that the monkey and the man wouldn't
[39:01] mix see that couldn't work but there was
[39:04] a beast standing there because the Bible
[39:07] called The Serpent was most sub of all
[39:09] Beast he was made a
[39:12] snake when his arms and legs went off he
[39:14] went on his belly and was crawling and
[39:16] said dust shall be thy meat that'll you
[39:19] know he was an upright creature walking
[39:21] around he could
[39:23] talk he did talk with Eve yes all right
[39:27] day in and day out they talked about
[39:32] things and you know
[39:35] yourself
[39:37] that now I get in trouble okay everybody
[39:41] says I'm picking on my wife I pick on
[39:43] everybody here now she thinks I do I
[39:45] pick on every one of
[39:47] us I don't mind saying it you can say
[39:50] well you why don't she tell you why
[39:51] something at home I tell her at home
[39:53] what I want to tell her but when I'm
[39:55] talking with the pull pit about women
[39:56] I'm talking about women not one
[40:00] woman all
[40:02] right I didn't say it your Prophet said
[40:06] that a woman was a thousand times easier
[40:08] to be deceived than a man now I didn't
[40:11] say that evidently he must have know
[40:13] what the Bible
[40:15] said don't you think
[40:18] so yeah but I ain't been deceived well
[40:21] you're one of the women that
[40:25] ain't
[40:27] but you know the truth about
[40:31] it that's why I'm against women working
[40:33] in offices with men and
[40:37] things I know some of you may have to do
[40:40] it I'm not saying anything other than
[40:41] I'm against
[40:43] it cuz you never go to work sisters
[40:47] smelling like you do the evening before
[40:49] at
[40:53] home
[40:55] right
[40:59] you're all pred up every time he sees
[41:02] you you're all fixed
[41:05] up
[41:10] huh and then they start
[41:15] talking and she just pours out her
[41:19] heart and says my husband is not being
[41:22] good to
[41:24] me hey he just not being good to me well
[41:28] then he start well that's right and my
[41:30] wife's not being good to me
[41:37] too that's how easy Satan can get an
[41:42] inroad and after a while you see things
[41:45] start getting flirty dirty as we call it
[41:47] or whatever the word is you know they
[41:50] begin to get too
[41:51] close things start
[41:55] happening well can't you see that's what
[41:57] happened in the
[42:05] garden the devil all he had to do was
[42:07] tell Eve say well you know Adam and the
[42:09] Lord hadn't and told you the whole
[42:17] story there's more to the
[42:20] story
[42:23] yeah they just hadn't told you all of it
[42:26] yet
[42:30] can't you look around and see the animal
[42:31] race and how they're
[42:35] multiplying well
[42:39] yeah but
[42:41] yet they think you're a dummy you don't
[42:45] understand see he's just easily
[42:49] inroad and I said every day at work
[42:52] gradually just a few words just a look
[42:55] just just a
[42:57] thing
[42:59] right right come
[43:07] on and in doing it it finally winds up
[43:09] into
[43:10] trouble well what happened in the
[43:14] garden but I want you to
[43:17] see the spiritual part of it are the the
[43:20] part of the contact was not a physical
[43:23] contact between Eve and the Beast to
[43:25] start with
[43:27] it was over a period of
[43:32] time and he begin to say you know he was
[43:34] made for this purpose look at the
[43:37] animals they're
[43:38] reproducing but you and Adam don't have
[43:41] any
[43:42] children they're keeping that from
[43:46] you well that's all it
[43:49] took right all you got to do is is to
[43:53] tell men or women either one you know
[43:56] you know I can say uh brother dick what
[43:59] does Brother Ray have a a forget
[44:02] it forget it oh not even never said
[44:06] anything forget
[44:07] it well brother Dick's going to wonder
[44:10] the rest of the day what's matter with
[44:13] Ray cuz I just planted a seed that's
[44:17] right I use them to cuz they own the
[44:20] they on the internet together all the
[44:21] time so they can yak with each
[44:25] other
[44:26] see what I want you to see is the
[44:30] Simplicity it wasn't just a
[44:33] ravishing
[44:34] act it took a long
[44:37] time to be able to break down the
[44:40] barrier that Eve was behind because
[44:43] remember she told Satan we can eat of
[44:48] every tree but this one tree we can't
[44:51] eat
[44:53] of well how come you can't eat of that
[44:56] tree and like I said Wednesday you just
[44:59] tell one of them little
[45:01] kids you tell them one of them little
[45:03] kids you say now every thing in this
[45:06] Garden out here you can do what you want
[45:08] do with it but leave that bush
[45:11] Alone Now where's the kid
[45:15] going going to the
[45:17] bush cuz it's something different
[45:22] tantalizing right
[45:24] boys oh no
[45:29] oh see we're just older
[45:32] kids it just takes a little bit
[45:35] more you
[45:36] know right for us older
[45:41] kids you know 70 80 years
[45:46] old but we still the human
[45:51] being it took Satan quite a while to be
[45:54] able to talk to Eve and be able to
[45:56] deceive her he got her to reason about
[46:00] what
[46:02] was you know what was going
[46:06] on and then she began to reason on that
[46:10] point see the next was a physical part
[46:13] all
[46:15] right but see it's not that we are
[46:18] physically in adultery today that wasn't
[46:21] what Paul was talking
[46:22] about Paul was talking to Christians
[46:26] right they should not have any thought
[46:28] about an adulterous act right he was
[46:32] talking to Christians when he said lest
[46:34] he deceive you through his subtility
[46:39] amen getting into inroad of owners and
[46:41] like I said a while ago don't you ever
[46:44] think that you can't be
[46:49] deceived well now the bride Brother D
[46:51] can't be
[46:53] deceived can't be deceived enough be
[46:56] lost I agree with
[46:57] you but I got a quote laying on the desk
[47:00] at home my wife keeps telling me what's
[47:02] all this I said quotes they just ly
[47:06] across there where brother Ram said it
[47:08] like this he said frankly if he didn't
[47:11] cut to work
[47:13] short for the elect's sake he said
[47:16] there'd be no flesh
[47:18] saved he said they'll have one quote
[47:20] says they'll have to come a
[47:22] Rapture well thank God because God
[47:25] keeping his word that he won't let us be
[47:28] deceived right but just
[47:31] remember when you didn't believe in one
[47:35] God but yet you believed in a
[47:39] trinity you was
[47:42] deceived
[47:45] true when you didn't believe that God
[47:47] sent a prophet for the last
[47:50] days he was
[47:54] deceived
[47:56] so don't worry about getting deceived
[47:58] that's what I've always tried to tell
[48:00] you I I don't try to preach to people to
[48:04] get them to deceived I try to preach to
[48:07] you to get you to an understanding
[48:08] you're already
[48:11] deceived all
[48:13] right see then that way I'm trying to
[48:16] touch the same thing or use the
[48:20] same
[48:22] positions to preach the gospel to you
[48:26] I'm using my
[48:29] reasoning my memory my
[48:32] conscience right to touch your memory
[48:36] your reason and your
[48:41] conscience because I know that's got
[48:43] where it's got to go through that's
[48:46] right all you're doing in the caste
[48:48] field smelling here is the vibrator in
[48:50] your ear is part of your body and it's
[48:52] vibrating but it turns that into
[48:57] words that makes you an ability to hear
[49:00] or a vocal cord is an ability to
[49:02] speak see the biggest sin of all is
[49:07] what what is sin it's not drinking
[49:10] gambling smoking right what is sin
[49:16] unbelief you do those things because you
[49:18] don't
[49:19] believe all right see
[49:22] unbelief unbelief in what
[49:26] in God's
[49:28] word Now Eve had a pretty good
[49:30] understanding of God's word she told the
[49:35] devil but he was trying to break down
[49:38] that
[49:40] uh
[49:42] barrier whatever that you would call it
[49:45] cuz she was a beautiful you she was in a
[49:47] perfect
[49:48] place coming from Adam no
[49:53] problems and your prophets wanted said
[49:55] it I
[49:57] didn't he said Eve was in
[50:00] Adam spiritually
[50:02] speaking and he said the reason Adam was
[50:05] lonely is because Eve was still in
[50:08] theophany
[50:11] right but how many preachers in this
[50:13] message is going to preach on
[50:15] that now I got a theophan up in heaven
[50:18] it's up under Eternal
[50:22] somewhere well why would you want
[50:24] eternal life here then just way you get
[50:27] up
[50:28] there right
[50:31] right you see what you don't realize is
[50:35] one thing I use that a lot you realize
[50:37] is
[50:41] is see Satan is still trying today to
[50:45] get you an eye off the
[50:48] word and he's doing a good
[50:51] job we've got one Bible like I said
[50:57] and got 969 different denominations off
[51:00] that one
[51:02] Bible we got one message and we got
[51:07] 10,000
[51:09] doctrines following the message all
[51:12] saying the prophet said
[51:13] that that's Mass
[51:16] confusion
[51:19] right well do you think you got all the
[51:22] truth no but what I got I thank God for
[51:26] and I'm sure glad to talk to you about
[51:31] it but you see the reason I'm I'm trying
[51:34] to get I know what he's been doing with
[51:36] this
[51:38] mind so I Don't Preach what's going on
[51:41] in your life that's where people think
[51:44] that I preach the things that I
[51:46] experience
[51:50] amen all
[51:52] right Satan comes and talks to this old
[51:54] boy all the
[51:56] time I don't mind admitting it but yet I
[52:01] want to hear how many of you will admit
[52:02] it I spend more time talking to the
[52:04] devil than I do
[52:06] God now you come on up here and let's
[52:08] see you toine
[52:12] that we pray 5 minutes a day where's the
[52:15] other 23 hours and 55
[52:20] minutes
[52:22] right the best we can do
[52:26] we spend more time communicating with
[52:28] the devil in the
[52:29] flesh than we do with
[52:32] God all
[52:34] right but Satan see he knows how to
[52:39] contact you and
[52:41] I he knew how to contact
[52:45] Eve he didn't start talking about how
[52:48] great he
[52:50] was now
[52:52] listen the devil never started talking
[52:54] about how great he was
[52:56] was he done seen that got him kicked out
[52:59] of
[53:00] heaven
[53:02] right you agree what got Satan kicked
[53:05] out of heaven him thinking how good he
[53:07] was and telling them other third of the
[53:09] Angels how good he was and how nice he
[53:12] was and everything and he ought to be in
[53:15] command and like I've always told you he
[53:17] never could understand because he was
[53:20] the anointed sherff standing beside the
[53:22] Lord probably the first Angel cre was
[53:26] Lucifer son of the morning God's
[53:29] right-and
[53:32] man and he's standing there and God says
[53:35] you know
[53:36] Lucifer I'm going to create a
[53:41] world I'll do it for
[53:46] you I'm the one that's going to do
[53:49] it and he said and Lucifer said I'm
[53:54] going help
[54:00] people there will be my way of doing
[54:03] things if I if he's got
[54:09] people and he's he says well okay now
[54:13] God let's get on with
[54:16] it well God don't turn around and say
[54:18] Lucifer you speak it about that time
[54:21] outstep
[54:23] somebody that's right
[54:26] right God in another
[54:29] form call the word L God speech etc
[54:34] etc and as he did he began to say Let
[54:37] There Be and Lucifer's
[54:40] watching he knows right then he' done
[54:42] lost his position that he thought he had
[54:47] he thought if there's anything to be
[54:48] done he's going to do
[54:50] it well you know
[54:54] what a lot of times we get that idea
[54:59] you I've heard preacher say if he
[55:02] anybody's going to preach it I'll be the
[55:03] one that'll preach it or brother so and
[55:06] so will you
[55:09] know well you know God uses who he wants
[55:14] to that's why I listen to your
[55:17] sisters cuz he can use you to talk to me
[55:20] any problem with
[55:24] that but you understand what I'm getting
[55:26] at
[55:29] yes
[55:33] Satan didn't come to Eve and say look at
[55:36] what I
[55:38] am he come to Eve and said look at what
[55:41] you
[55:44] are he knew better than to tell her what
[55:47] his real plan
[55:48] was now come on we get in a church age
[55:50] book a later where the prophet of God
[55:53] said that that tree of knowledge was
[55:55] there and said it had to do with Mankind
[55:58] and said would be the inroad of Satan in
[56:01] his ways of entering into the human race
[56:04] that he could not
[56:07] create as God
[56:10] could so he had to get Eve to go along
[56:13] with a
[56:14] plan what
[56:22] plan do you think Eve was just that
[56:28] bad of a
[56:30] person
[56:33] no why would your Prophet say Eve
[56:37] thought she was
[56:39] right and he says she still thinks she's
[56:43] right now you to answer that one you
[56:45] sisters come
[56:50] on now that's what he
[56:53] said he said she thinks she's right and
[56:56] he said she still thinks she's right he
[56:58] said look at the churches they're all
[57:01] women
[57:02] right no mother of Revelation 17
[57:06] Harlot daughters and don't they still
[57:08] think they're right
[57:10] right I haven't seen any news
[57:13] commentator yet saying that the Baptist
[57:15] admitted that's wrong have you and I'm
[57:18] not throwing off on Baptist I'm just
[57:20] using that as a
[57:23] word but think
[57:26] he did not approach her as to try to
[57:30] show her who he
[57:33] was he knew that would come to
[57:36] pass as time went
[57:40] on
[57:42] right but he tried to get her to see who
[57:45] she
[57:48] was she was to bring in the human
[57:53] race
[57:59] right whether it would be physical or
[58:01] whatever you want to call it foken word
[58:03] I still
[58:04] believe Eve would have been used to
[58:07] bring the human race into being if she
[58:10] hadn't
[58:13] Fallen don't you okay you know why I
[58:17] believe that because she was the one
[58:19] that was used to bring it out to the
[58:21] fall right and she still think she's
[58:30] right you think a woman is going to tell
[58:32] you she's deceived not a man ain't
[58:37] either
[58:42] right well that wasn't really like it
[58:44] was they didn't tell it like it's
[58:46] supposed to be ain't that our ways of
[58:49] doing you
[58:51] know like I heard of a man saying one
[58:53] time and this man was telling the truth
[58:56] now according to him because he saw it
[58:59] he was riding in home to the taking a
[59:01] man home one day and there stood the the
[59:04] man that he was taking home you know
[59:06] there stood his wife on the porch
[59:07] kissing the
[59:09] man you
[59:11] know and he pulled up and boy he jumped
[59:13] on to her a you're kissing that
[59:17] man she said I wasn't kissing that
[59:20] man he said I saw you kissing him he
[59:24] said
[59:25] she said to him are you going to believe
[59:27] what your eyes saw or you going to
[59:29] believe what I tell
[59:36] you
[59:38] right now that's pretty deceiving
[59:41] right when the man said well I guess I
[59:44] didn't see what I thought I
[59:47] saw now that was not told it was a joke
[59:49] that was supposed to been told it was a
[59:51] story that was
[59:53] true because really what was she saying
[59:56] she was saying if you think I was
[59:58] kissing that man you get out the
[1:00:00] door but if you'll accept I wouldn't
[1:00:03] kissing that man you can stay
[1:00:08] here come on
[1:00:11] women you know what you got and what to
[1:00:14] do with
[1:00:16] it
[1:00:18] right is that vulgar no
[1:00:23] truth
[1:00:26] and it took a while for Satan to be able
[1:00:28] to get Eve to the point to
[1:00:33] believe that she was going to have a
[1:00:35] part to
[1:00:38] do in bringing forth the promise of
[1:00:44] God come on we can spend all day talking
[1:00:46] about it right Satan could tell her say
[1:00:48] well look look at the animals they're
[1:00:50] reproducing but you and Adam's not
[1:00:53] reproducing
[1:00:56] said whatever it's going to
[1:00:58] be get on with
[1:01:02] it now if you think I ain't right we're
[1:01:05] going to get into the scriptures a
[1:01:06] little later but what did Eve say
[1:01:10] about
[1:01:13] Cain is in the
[1:01:15] scripture she said I got a man from the
[1:01:22] Lord that's what he said that's
[1:01:26] right now remember her name wasn't Eve
[1:01:28] to start with her name was
[1:01:32] Adam Eve is over where the fall
[1:01:36] came right she was not called Eve in
[1:01:38] Chapter 2 three or what it is there it
[1:01:41] was when that come forth and said Eve
[1:01:44] because she's the mother of all
[1:01:46] living that's where she developed the
[1:01:48] name Eve before the in her name was
[1:01:51] Adam just like Christ and a bride
[1:01:55] but when we let Satan try to inroad into
[1:01:57] our
[1:01:58] minds and deceive
[1:02:02] us
[1:02:04] right but you see sometimes it's hard to
[1:02:07] comprehend
[1:02:09] truth easy to preach a lie that's
[1:02:14] right you know Paul said for us to get
[1:02:17] away from endless genealogies you
[1:02:20] remember that in
[1:02:23] Scripture
[1:02:26] and yet God was the one that said make
[1:02:27] all the records of the
[1:02:32] people God is the one that made all of
[1:02:34] the Endless
[1:02:37] genealogies what's Paul talking
[1:02:42] about when he says get away from endless
[1:02:50] genealogy he's telling you to get away
[1:02:54] from from trying to run some form of a
[1:02:56] lineage that you could find yourself
[1:02:59] somewhere CU that's endless genealogy
[1:03:02] but for it to say so and so we got so
[1:03:04] and so and so and so we got so and so
[1:03:06] and so I remember in the Baptist say we
[1:03:09] were requested that we read the Bible
[1:03:11] well the first time I began to read it I
[1:03:13] really enjoyed a whole lot of it but
[1:03:14] when I got over into part of it I began
[1:03:16] to read so and so but got so and so and
[1:03:18] so and so but got so and so and so and
[1:03:20] so and but got so and so and so and so
[1:03:21] and I hour later I was still so and so
[1:03:24] gotten so and so right that sounds like
[1:03:28] endless genealogy but it's
[1:03:32] not that is not endless genealogy that
[1:03:35] is not what Paul was talking about of
[1:03:38] keeping records that's
[1:03:40] right because that is a record of the
[1:03:44] children of
[1:03:46] Israel right cuz it comes right on down
[1:03:49] and it says and so and so and so and so
[1:03:51] we
[1:03:53] got and Adam I mean David and David So a
[1:03:59] genealogy what am I doing illustrating
[1:04:02] how easy it is to be
[1:04:04] deceived to quote the scripture we don't
[1:04:07] believe in Endless genealogies okay
[1:04:09] let's take and just rip out them Pages
[1:04:12] out of the Bible that gives all the
[1:04:18] records you see Satan's wisdom is still
[1:04:22] deceiving you and I tonight I mean this
[1:04:29] afternoon you said but Brother D I've
[1:04:31] been in the message 40 years amen how
[1:04:34] long's the message been in
[1:04:39] you
[1:04:41] right I left the Baptist Church and
[1:04:43] walked
[1:04:44] out I said
[1:04:46] Lord first church I was in it gainful I
[1:04:49] said
[1:04:51] Lord I'm glad you got me out of the bap
[1:04:55] but now would you get the Baptist out of
[1:04:59] me I don't believe none of that oh why
[1:05:03] we still tied up with
[1:05:08] it thinking
[1:05:12] about what took Eve
[1:05:17] down was the simple things that's taking
[1:05:19] you and I
[1:05:23] down
[1:05:28] right some of you are sitting here
[1:05:30] without mates you know no husband no
[1:05:35] wife I shouldn't have to explain a lot
[1:05:37] of
[1:05:39] things especially to you because you
[1:05:42] know what the devil does to you that's
[1:05:44] right and talks to you that's
[1:05:51] right you see I'm not picking on anybody
[1:05:53] I'm picking on
[1:05:57] everybody we let
[1:06:00] Satan interpret to you and I
[1:06:05] amen
[1:06:07] right and he tells
[1:06:10] us what the prophet is
[1:06:13] saying what the Bible is
[1:06:15] saying that's okay if it's
[1:06:18] true but like I said this morning
[1:06:22] uh showing the simplicity I'm just
[1:06:24] talking I'm just trying to
[1:06:27] talk to us about what happened in that
[1:06:32] fall everybody wants to run over to
[1:06:35] the literal
[1:06:38] act like I said Paul wasn't writing to
[1:06:41] people about a literal act in 2
[1:06:45] Corinthians but he was warning us that
[1:06:48] Satan through his subtility would try
[1:06:51] his best to deceive us right
[1:06:54] right
[1:06:56] right what are they doing now in the
[1:06:58] message attacking the
[1:07:01] message attacked in the
[1:07:03] prophet attacked in the statements he
[1:07:06] made what are they trying to
[1:07:10] do to get you and I where we won't
[1:07:13] believe
[1:07:14] it cuz if you entertain those
[1:07:18] thoughts you
[1:07:20] know you entertain it now come on don't
[1:07:24] play games with me I don't play games
[1:07:25] with you okay that's what gets me into
[1:07:27] trouble I'm too plain but I don't want
[1:07:29] people playing games with me I don't
[1:07:30] want to play nothing with you I
[1:07:32] don't I mean what I say and say what I
[1:07:35] mean I
[1:07:38] don't see then Satan will attack our
[1:07:42] minds and try to
[1:07:45] interpret the message to
[1:07:48] us or he'll say look at there he said
[1:07:52] this and he said said
[1:07:54] this we can't believe
[1:07:57] it I mean he done that when we was in
[1:08:00] the Baptist Methodist didn't he
[1:08:03] Pentecostals didn't the devil tell you
[1:08:05] that you can't trust the
[1:08:08] Bible right didn't he tell you where the
[1:08:11] fallacies was in it the contradictions
[1:08:13] that was in
[1:08:16] it no probably a lot of lot of people
[1:08:19] like biggest portion of people they were
[1:08:20] sitting there just like they're sitting
[1:08:22] now what do you mean message I believe
[1:08:24] everything Prophet
[1:08:26] says well it says forsake not to assem
[1:08:28] any of yourselves together as the manner
[1:08:30] of unbelievers
[1:08:32] are let me turn over that
[1:08:35] page
[1:08:38] right see you don't want to be
[1:08:41] exposed nobody
[1:08:44] does but is it
[1:08:47] true see Satan has got his inroad
[1:08:50] through our
[1:08:52] reasoning
[1:08:54] and if he can tear
[1:08:56] down our thoughts about the
[1:09:00] message to think that the prophet was
[1:09:02] not right because of a wrong date that
[1:09:06] was given or a incident that happened
[1:09:09] here when it should have happened over
[1:09:13] there Satan is planting those things in
[1:09:16] the mind of the
[1:09:17] people right
[1:09:20] right
[1:09:22] right and there turning down the truth
[1:09:25] cuz they will not listen to
[1:09:27] Somebody
[1:09:30] amen like waitting I in a Services just
[1:09:32] recently in the ministri meeting went
[1:09:35] through at
[1:09:36] length on Daniel 70 weeks to show that
[1:09:39] brother randam was
[1:09:41] right and it never changed one of those
[1:09:46] ministers but yet they got up later and
[1:09:48] said brother Randon was right over here
[1:09:49] and wrong over here or you can't believe
[1:09:52] this you can't believe that
[1:09:58] all I ask him at the end of it I said
[1:09:59] come show me where I'm
[1:10:02] wrong well you know what they're
[1:10:05] saying I don't believe
[1:10:08] it I don't believe it the way you
[1:10:10] believe
[1:10:13] it
[1:10:15] okay but is it what God
[1:10:19] said if the Bible says there's one true
[1:10:21] and living God then where do we have any
[1:10:23] right to do discuss or think about how
[1:10:26] it could have been that it could be some
[1:10:28] way of a Trinity
[1:10:33] right right
[1:10:37] right there's no discussion that's
[1:10:42] right and when a prophet would say Eve
[1:10:45] was
[1:10:50] deceived how many of you sisters have
[1:10:52] had it in your mind since I've been
[1:10:55] talking Adam was too I
[1:10:59] guess now who told you
[1:11:01] that you said well you did well to go
[1:11:03] because you was
[1:11:05] talking but you understand what I'm
[1:11:07] getting at
[1:11:10] yes and the Bible says something and we
[1:11:13] don't believe it as to what it says
[1:11:16] understand it we're
[1:11:22] deceived and see that's what I watch and
[1:11:25] I keep saying to you and I over and
[1:11:29] over let's believe this
[1:11:32] message and no matter what anybody says
[1:11:36] that's right we stay with the
[1:11:42] message right amen yeah but look at
[1:11:46] what's Happening Here look what's
[1:11:47] happening
[1:11:50] there look out here where they're having
[1:11:52] these great meetings and things
[1:11:56] well
[1:12:00] wonderful well we just sit around here
[1:12:02] dry well the reason you're dry is
[1:12:04] because you to
[1:12:06] hide it sure a never been my fault if
[1:12:09] you dry right you said well you just
[1:12:12] yeah I know it I just try to preach the
[1:12:16] word that's one if I'm dry that then
[1:12:19] I'll just stay with it I won't argue
[1:12:21] about KN the rest of it that's right
[1:12:23] I've been at it 40 something years I
[1:12:24] might as well keep
[1:12:27] on but in 40 something
[1:12:30] years I've asked you to show me the
[1:12:33] truth that's
[1:12:35] right if I'm not telling you the truth
[1:12:38] that's
[1:12:41] right like I said this
[1:12:43] morning then the people of the message
[1:12:45] will quote you something from brother
[1:12:47] brandham and they don't even look to see
[1:12:50] whether
[1:12:52] it's tying together correctly or
[1:13:01] not see not even looking to see whether
[1:13:03] that what he's saying is Right compared
[1:13:06] to what he says 40 years
[1:13:10] later I believe in in Progressive I know
[1:13:14] they say that's not a good word that's
[1:13:15] all right that's all I
[1:13:17] got progressive revelation I believe in
[1:13:20] that and what I mean by it is
[1:13:24] maybe not your interpretation of the
[1:13:25] word Progressive but what I mean is that
[1:13:28] God revealed something to you and while
[1:13:30] he'll reveal more and more and more and
[1:13:33] more and more and more of the same thing
[1:13:35] that's but if he revealed something to
[1:13:38] you and then a year later he revealed
[1:13:40] something that's contrary to that now
[1:13:43] one of them is the devil that's talking
[1:13:44] to you that's right might be both of
[1:13:47] them being the
[1:13:48] devil right I've got that much
[1:13:52] sense
[1:13:54] that's why I call that phrase see if you
[1:13:56] start off with a white dog in Genesis
[1:13:58] you better wind up with a white dog in
[1:14:00] the Book of Revelations it don't matter
[1:14:02] if you get there with a black and white
[1:14:03] dog that ain't what God Said to begin
[1:14:05] with that's
[1:14:07] right God can't he doesn't give
[1:14:10] something and then correct it
[1:14:13] right mankind gets something and God
[1:14:16] corrects
[1:14:18] it but God don't give something and
[1:14:20] correct it later that's right right
[1:14:24] no he was right to start with or he's
[1:14:25] not
[1:14:28] God all right but you see we want to
[1:14:31] talk about how bad you know how wrong
[1:14:35] this was or how wrong that is that ain't
[1:14:37] nothing but the devil as an inroad into
[1:14:39] your
[1:14:42] mind as I saying this morning then we
[1:14:44] look at Matthew
[1:14:48] 28:19 Jesus told the disciples after his
[1:14:52] resurrection to go preach the gospel
[1:14:55] baptizing the people in the name of the
[1:14:56] father and of the son and of the Holy
[1:15:01] Ghost on the day of Pentecost when the
[1:15:03] Holy Ghost fell they came outside and
[1:15:07] they said men and Brethren what must we
[1:15:08] do to be saved they said repent every
[1:15:11] one of them be baptized in the name of
[1:15:12] Jesus
[1:15:13] Christ you mean they couldn't remember
[1:15:15] Father Son and Holy
[1:15:19] Ghost
[1:15:21] come I a direct
[1:15:25] contradiction but it ain't a
[1:15:27] contradiction
[1:15:29] why because Father Son and Holy Ghost is
[1:15:31] Lord Jesus Christ Peter done exactly
[1:15:34] what Jesus told him to do amen remember
[1:15:37] he was the spokesman the one Chosen and
[1:15:40] given the keys
[1:15:45] right but you see we put all of our
[1:15:47] Lives spend in in there Worlds the world
[1:15:50] is split over father son Holy Ghost Lord
[1:15:53] Jesus Christ
[1:15:57] whatever and because you don't believe
[1:15:58] their way you're going to go to
[1:16:04] hell well see the truth is the
[1:16:09] truth but Satan will still try to
[1:16:12] interpret that that's right as I ended
[1:16:15] up this morning showing
[1:16:17] you that the prophet of God up until
[1:16:20] 196 really up to 65
[1:16:26] he was describing the the you the three
[1:16:30] Realms of
[1:16:32] men and he would say body five
[1:16:36] senses C tast feels smelling here he'd
[1:16:39] say second real
[1:16:42] Soul memory reason conscious affections
[1:16:45] Etc and he'd say
[1:16:48] Spirit only one sense Faith or doubt
[1:16:53] then when he come up to the end of
[1:16:56] 65 he picks up and he says Body Spirit
[1:17:01] and
[1:17:05] soul you say well is that important for
[1:17:07] us to understand that very very
[1:17:13] vital very very vital one of the most
[1:17:16] vital things I could think of right
[1:17:19] now because if not you got him in a
[1:17:21] direct contradiction
[1:17:26] well show me where he straightened it
[1:17:27] out he didn't have
[1:17:29] to cuz he was
[1:17:32] right Soul and Spirit is an
[1:17:34] interchangeable word yes it's used in
[1:17:38] the Bible
[1:17:40] interchangeably you got to know who it's
[1:17:42] talking about or what it's talking about
[1:17:44] Amen to Define which one it's speaking
[1:17:50] of see the prophet didn't have to
[1:17:52] correct it cuz he always gave five
[1:17:55] senses to the body he always gave five
[1:17:58] senses memory reason conscious
[1:18:01] affections right to the second real he
[1:18:04] always gave the center realm Faith or
[1:18:07] doubt
[1:18:10] amen well he didn't have to correct it
[1:18:12] because he was moving this wording maybe
[1:18:17] that was the way God done it because
[1:18:21] Hebrews 4:12 says that the word of God
[1:18:24] is
[1:18:25] powerful dividing between Soul and
[1:18:30] Spirit joint
[1:18:32] miror that's right now men have
[1:18:34] attempted to
[1:18:37] explain what a soul is what a spirit
[1:18:39] part
[1:18:40] is but where did you ever hear anybody
[1:18:43] could explain it like a seventh grade
[1:18:46] educated little old Prophet that's right
[1:18:49] can't you just see them Scholars sitting
[1:18:51] there the day he draws it out and
[1:18:52] they're just ding
[1:18:55] laughing and after a while he says well
[1:18:57] here's the
[1:19:03] Bible they can't
[1:19:05] argue Paul said that your body spirit
[1:19:08] and soul beer
[1:19:11] blameless
[1:19:14] right but you see he said why is it
[1:19:18] important for us to understand what he's
[1:19:19] talking because in his early Ministry he
[1:19:22] would inter the word Soul and
[1:19:24] Spirit and you see all kind of doctrines
[1:19:27] proved by the people of the
[1:19:30] message they say see th Eve Sinn in her
[1:19:34] soul that's a direct quote out spoken
[1:19:37] out of
[1:19:39] uh greatest battle ever
[1:19:44] fought now e sined in her soul she was
[1:19:51] lost and he's already already in that
[1:19:53] message covered or the Blasphemous names
[1:19:58] that that they had eternal
[1:20:02] life but you see people don't read and
[1:20:04] study it they just get an idea see there
[1:20:08] he sending her soul he's two Souls that
[1:20:11] was the doctrine years
[1:20:14] ago go back and see what he's talking
[1:20:19] about see whether he's talking about the
[1:20:21] outer real the rim or the middle Rim see
[1:20:24] which one he's talking about and then
[1:20:26] you'll have the right answer no matter
[1:20:29] what you use Soul and Spirit cuz it's
[1:20:31] totally interchangeable
[1:20:34] words where it says into thy hands I
[1:20:36] commend my
[1:20:38] spirit Jesus would say hanging on the
[1:20:40] cross or there in the garden my soul is
[1:20:47] troubled you see we are
[1:20:50] a trone being in basis of Father Son and
[1:20:54] Holy Ghost as an example but we're Body
[1:20:57] Spirit and
[1:20:59] soul all right go back in the early
[1:21:02] Ministry and listen to where he
[1:21:05] interchangeable and he'll never
[1:21:08] say he'll always say the second realm of
[1:21:11] man as memory reason conscious and
[1:21:14] affection doesn't matter if he calls it
[1:21:18] Soul all
[1:21:20] right but you see I thought maybe
[1:21:22] somebody today might be thinking cuz I
[1:21:24] was going to read these this morning and
[1:21:27] uh you know so we didn't get into it
[1:21:31] well I just happened to run them
[1:21:36] off now I only have about 40 copies so
[1:21:39] just take one copy per family where it
[1:21:42] brother around them on one side of the
[1:21:43] page is saying
[1:21:46] Body Soul
[1:21:49] Spirit the other side of the page in the
[1:21:51] 65 he's saying Body Spirit and
[1:22:00] soul so pass him out if you will while
[1:22:04] I'm
[1:22:05] talking cuz I want you to see that
[1:22:07] that's what he's
[1:22:08] saying but he's not
[1:22:12] contradictory it's just what I said
[1:22:15] Hebrews says 4:12 that the word that he
[1:22:21] came into
[1:22:23] in total Perfection will
[1:22:26] separate Soul and Spirit joint
[1:22:30] Myra all right as it does
[1:22:34] then we can see what took place in the
[1:22:41] garden brother Rand will say
[1:22:45] Eve sinned in her
[1:22:51] soul
[1:22:54] but then later he'll
[1:22:55] say it was the spirit of
[1:22:58] man and that you can even be Anointed
[1:23:01] with the Holy Spirit every day of your
[1:23:03] life on your spirit and die and go to
[1:23:09] hell bringing those two together see it
[1:23:12] didn't have to be
[1:23:14] corrected because he was
[1:23:17] right he just placed his senses in the
[1:23:20] correct
[1:23:21] order
[1:23:25] he always gave that first one C taste
[1:23:27] feel smell and here second Rim memory
[1:23:29] reason conscious affection no matter
[1:23:31] what he called it and the third was
[1:23:34] always Faith or doubt he didn't have to
[1:23:37] correct
[1:23:40] nothing but yet man are so smart do we
[1:23:43] get into the do and say well I got this
[1:23:45] quote here that says he send in or
[1:23:51] soul
[1:23:53] he may even say you sin in your
[1:23:56] soul but if you're a born again
[1:24:02] Christian you can't sin in your soul
[1:24:06] right but you can do wrong in your body
[1:24:08] and your
[1:24:10] spirit don't ever think you can't do
[1:24:13] wrong cuz you're right in Satan's
[1:24:16] trap thank you
[1:24:18] brother I just wanted you to read that
[1:24:20] of how many times
[1:24:24] that he started there in ' 65 and he was
[1:24:25] using Body Spirit and
[1:24:29] soul then you can understand the message
[1:24:31] you understand
[1:24:35] Jesus and the way he would
[1:24:40] speak see Satan is using every little
[1:24:43] thing that he
[1:24:47] can to try to take us
[1:24:51] down
[1:24:54] well you can't trust the message until
[1:24:59] 63 why
[1:25:01] not he was a prophet wasn't he did he
[1:25:05] become a prophet in '
[1:25:06] 63 or was he born a
[1:25:10] prophet I've asked for contradictions in
[1:25:13] the
[1:25:15] message I didn't ask for
[1:25:18] stupidity I want something founded thank
[1:25:20] you brother I want something you know
[1:25:23] where you can look at
[1:25:29] it to where the Prophet was wrong now
[1:25:32] humanly speaking yes he was wrong at
[1:25:35] times
[1:25:37] right but I want somebody to show me
[1:25:39] where the message is
[1:25:41] wrong cuz he said said so much of this
[1:25:44] message
[1:25:45] is human beings cuz he was he said one
[1:25:49] day he said the black and white will
[1:25:51] fight again and die like
[1:25:56] flies that's right but I got that
[1:26:00] quote but go to the next tape right
[1:26:03] after then when he said that and listen
[1:26:06] to him say that was my idea that was not
[1:26:10] the Lord telling
[1:26:15] me you see we can put it in all kind of
[1:26:18] forms right twist anything to make it
[1:26:22] say what we want it to
[1:26:24] say and isn't that the same inroad that
[1:26:27] Satan has always
[1:26:30] used what are you trying to do brother
[1:26:32] Dale we'll end it by saying this much
[1:26:36] trying to get you and I to look at
[1:26:37] something straight up and down right
[1:26:40] now it's not what happened in the
[1:26:42] garden
[1:26:45] right what happened in the garden only
[1:26:47] brought about the the the thing that
[1:26:49] would cause the
[1:26:51] fall
[1:26:54] but you and I are sitting here in the
[1:26:56] day in a
[1:26:59] time that Satan's going to put us in the
[1:27:05] grave I told you that 40 years ago and I
[1:27:09] still don't back
[1:27:11] up I said over 40 years ago that the
[1:27:14] biggest portion of the Believers of this
[1:27:15] message would die and go by the
[1:27:20] grave ain't nobody can argue the point
[1:27:22] cuz You' heard it enough you'd have been
[1:27:24] here 20 years it heard it 20
[1:27:27] years you know what I meant just what I
[1:27:31] said it's going to take something to
[1:27:33] make a
[1:27:35] change right and until we get it right
[1:27:39] and we're going to get into Blas get
[1:27:41] into the greatest battle ever fought
[1:27:42] I've asked you to read that message
[1:27:45] brother randam said right under where
[1:27:47] he's explaining that Eve began to reason
[1:27:50] and messed up the flues and and caused
[1:27:53] the problem you know what he said he
[1:27:55] said if we can get this certain thing
[1:27:59] fixed he said there won't be a sick
[1:28:01] person Among Us in five
[1:28:06] minutes said they won't be a sinner
[1:28:09] Among Us in five
[1:28:14] minutes he wasn't just preaching the
[1:28:17] Realms of Eve and the Realms of
[1:28:19] mankind he was preaching to what we're
[1:28:26] doing you don't reason with your
[1:28:30] soul is either Faith or
[1:28:34] doubt you reason with your spirit
[1:28:38] realm and
[1:28:41] remember the Bible talks about the
[1:28:44] sins you know the prophet of God said
[1:28:47] only Christians sin he said because
[1:28:50] everybody else is already condemned
[1:28:51] already
[1:28:53] you said what I don't sin brother
[1:28:56] Dale Prophet said you did so argue with
[1:28:59] him the Bible says you do says for the
[1:29:03] sins yeah but I don't disbelieve God's
[1:29:10] word back to this morning how come it is
[1:29:13] when somebody presents something to
[1:29:17] you whether you be in the Bible talking
[1:29:19] about baptist Methodist whatever or
[1:29:21] where you be talking about the people of
[1:29:22] this message what's the first
[1:29:26] reaction I don't believe it that
[1:29:30] way right or I don't know what I believe
[1:29:35] but I don't believe you that's
[1:29:38] right right that's the biggest
[1:29:41] one I don't know what I believe and I
[1:29:44] can't explain what I believe but I don't
[1:29:45] believe you well that's a good one a it
[1:29:49] right now I call that being deceived
[1:29:52] right because you asked me to tell you
[1:29:57] where I don't agree with you
[1:29:59] at and I'll try my best to explain
[1:30:03] it you won't get I don't know but I'm
[1:30:07] just don't believe
[1:30:11] you that's degrading that Al anything
[1:30:16] else but
[1:30:18] listen the seed of the serpent is the
[1:30:21] LIE that Eve Satan told Eve that's
[1:30:27] right CU it never been but one
[1:30:30] lie you remember it's the LIE there in
[1:30:34] the scripture the same lie he told
[1:30:40] Eve and how close it is to the
[1:30:46] truth because what was the lie that he
[1:30:48] told Eve he didn't talk to her about
[1:30:50] himself he talked to her about
[1:30:53] her got her to believe in
[1:30:57] it well how close is it when a preacher
[1:30:59] gets up and stands up and says the Bride
[1:31:01] of Jesus Christ is the liest form of God
[1:31:06] on the
[1:31:12] earth that's getting pretty close is
[1:31:15] it you think Satan ain't going to get in
[1:31:18] there and do
[1:31:20] that
[1:31:22] he ain't going to attack nothing else
[1:31:23] that's where he's running

[1:31:48] garden is the same thing that's
[1:31:50] happening to you and I right now

[1:39:30] what happened in the
[1:39:32] garden I mean that's head
[1:39:35] knowledge right you can read it out of
[1:39:37] the book I said knowledge that's right

[1:40:08] it would come a time that it'll change
[1:40:09] from that but here in the end time he's

[1:40:19] ready but it won't be long until the
[1:40:23] real one will be
[1:40:25] exposed and you'll find out he'll be
[1:40:27] starting to talk about
[1:40:29] himself because all these years he's
[1:40:31] been talking about her trying to get her
[1:40:34] deceived when he gets her deceived
[1:40:36] enough he'll step out the Bible calls
[1:40:40] him the man of sin sitting in the temple
[1:40:42] of God showing himself to be as
[1:40:46] God you say oh it's this one it's that
[1:40:48] one you can put names on it
