[0:00] three we've got full house I'm already a
[0:01] little set up if they come in around the
[0:05] little bit back there back so well we're
[0:11] we're speaking on the book of Revelation
[0:13] we went through chapter one two and
[0:15] three we just want the bride in its
[0:18] fullness and then we saw the last church
[0:21] age which was Laodicea and in the
[0:25] Lausanne Church age we see that that's
[0:27] the church age were him and the church
[0:30] age does not end remember hmm it does
[0:34] for us but it will not end until we come
[0:39] over past the Millennium if I got that
[0:42] because millennium it's gonna be in time
[0:44] there will be a seventh day
[0:47] millennium everybody got that yeah
[0:49] because you and I in typing we must have
[0:53] a eight today we're gonna talk about
[0:57] then when we get into these feast days
[0:59] you have an eighth day well the eighth
[1:02] day is the future home because that's
[1:05] eternity faith which is your symbol like
[1:08] this with no beginning and no end but it
[1:11] won't turn it like this it makes it page
[1:13] 7 is completion but time is going to
[1:20] continue on for at least another
[1:21] thousand years after we leave actually a
[1:25] thousand years three and half years that
[1:27] doesn't matter to us because today if
[1:30] you're born again Paul was born again he
[1:33] become an eight and eight and they and
[1:35] they and they that's why the prophet of
[1:39] God said that the bride never was in the
[1:42] church age now you take that literally
[1:45] he was not right but if you take it
[1:47] spiritually literally we're in Laodicea
[1:50] and we have all of the spirits of layout
[1:54] of sealed we have all the things we have
[1:57] to get through but in you're born again
[1:59] you're in an eighth day you're you're
[2:01] already eternal so that's why when we
[2:04] come back into millennium we're just
[2:06] going to be eternal people right here
[2:09] when we take a body change
[2:11] it'll make this thing an eight-day but
[2:14] now for right now sorry to tell you this
[2:18] is still in the old seventh day which is
[2:21] morning the evening as both Elise was
[2:24] talking about you know you come into the
[2:26] Riu regular days but now remember when
[2:29] we get to this eighth day future home
[2:31] bible says them need no life being the
[2:34] city
[2:34] why because we'll be glowing it's like
[2:36] we were talking about hmm Eloisa turned
[2:40] out wonderfully Wednesday is that when
[2:43] God said let there be light see the
[2:46] devil didn't put it out
[2:48] you just put a shield up in front of it
[2:50] called sin and we've had to deal with
[2:52] that all the way to where because
[2:54] remember the light inside here can be
[2:55] put out but when we come to this future
[2:59] home we will need light because you and
[3:00] I'll all be be light not hey like Satan
[3:04] can be a light don't remember instance
[3:08] he's he's sure he's a demon of darkness
[3:10] but he likes to become the light because
[3:13] the Bible said Jesus told the disciples
[3:16] Pharisees he said in that light in you
[3:19] be darkness how great is that darkness
[3:21] they thought they had like they were
[3:23] dark the world thinks to have light
[3:26] people this world you know litters think
[3:29] they're invincible they I'm gonna light
[3:31] their in darkness and you and I are in
[3:33] darkness unless you born again but when
[3:35] you born again you come up into an
[3:37] eighth day so here we see in chapter
[3:40] four it says after this in other words
[3:43] after the church ages behold a door now
[3:45] who is the door Jesus Christ is disorder
[3:49] alright good the door was opened in
[3:52] heaven now remember we're all under an
[3:53] open book open in heaven hi and the
[3:59] first voice which I heard
[4:02] was as it were of a trumpet talking to
[4:05] Mina what is a trumpet is a message and
[4:07] denote something going forth all right
[4:11] talking to who me so that's why the
[4:16] rapture is a revelation that's God
[4:19] talking to you when you get born again
[4:22] God has said I'm talking to you and you
[4:28] have been born again I'm talking to you
[4:30] now I'm going to use a five fold
[4:31] ministry I'm gonna use a layout team to
[4:38] speak to you but it's me talking to you
[4:41] because I didn't say the sound of a
[4:43] trumpet talking to them it's not a bunch
[4:47] of denominations and not a bunch of this
[4:48] is how the other it's him it's God
[4:51] Almighty talking to you which said come
[4:54] up hither and every time we come to
[4:58] church over time we do press play and
[5:00] all the different things that we do as
[5:02] far as my full ministry and listening to
[5:03] the Prophet that's what should be is not
[5:08] a message of good will and good cheer
[5:11] and how to live on the earth which has
[5:12] got something to do with it while
[5:14] they're in our earthly journey but
[5:16] brother bill every morning and brother
[5:17] branham and on any of these ministers
[5:19] release enough they're telling you as
[5:22] soon as they open their mouth that
[5:23] should become a pillar because we're
[5:26] trying to get up out of this thing so
[5:30] that's John is the top of the whole
[5:34] bride and he hears the voice that says
[5:37] come up hither and I will show thee
[5:40] things which must be Hereafter so in
[5:42] other words he's going to give you a
[5:44] revelation
[5:44] that's not just gonna birthed you into
[5:46] his body and then say I think for
[5:49] yourself no that's why we've been on
[5:52] this journey of a Christian for a long
[5:54] time and we're still even in these feast
[5:55] days we're going to be talking about the
[5:57] journey of a Christian because you have
[5:59] a spiritual journey just like Israel had
[6:02] a natural journey just like Abram and
[6:04] Abraham
[6:05] Journey Ruth and Esther had a natural
[6:08] journey that they went through to help
[6:11] you that you can read in the Bible say
[6:13] man I went through that right there
[6:14] I'm going through this right here let's
[6:17] see what extra set of Madilyn c13 so
[6:19] it's a Bible sit down write to show thee
[6:22] things which must be Hereafter
[6:25] now obviously he was in the spirit lift
[6:31] it up and after almost a heaven in 3 set
[6:34] on the throne 1 so the greatest
[6:44] revelation you can ever have is one true
[6:47] and living God and that that same God
[6:51] created the world created you and burped
[6:54] you died for you rose for you came back
[6:58] on heard that Pentagon for you and he's
[7:01] sitting on what's wrong oh oh brother
[7:05] he's up there somewhere and he's got
[7:06] this great big ugly throne
[7:09] no he's sittin in your throne he's
[7:12] either sitting in the throne room or one
[7:14] to get in your throne room alright so
[7:18] immediately I was in the spirit are
[7:20] caught up in the spirit because remember
[7:21] nope
[7:23] you got to see revelations is in layers
[7:27] right even your revelation is in layers
[7:31] you get a revelation 1 through Lynn with
[7:32] God and then you hear a few things like
[7:33] brother weeks is bringing out a couple
[7:35] playing win tonight I then I had it's
[7:37] not that I didn't see it that way it's
[7:39] just to die never saying it that way
[7:44] good y'all need to tell these people
[7:48] like like I said before if a preacher
[7:50] says all I don't need recognition then
[7:53] he's a liar
[7:54] even brother branham said that the brown
[7:57] said that man was a liar
[7:58] he said I like somebody pat me on the
[8:00] back then I did so anyway go for him
[8:04] again and if it was God speaking to you
[8:06] then he just got out of the way and let
[8:08] God speak so what a gift that's to me
[8:10] that's the greatest gift in the world if
[8:12] you get out of the way let God do the
[8:13] work so behold a throne was set in
[8:18] heaven and one sat on the throne now
[8:20] this is a look at me this is natural
[8:23] John John natural John is writing
[8:26] remember when he said way back over
[8:28] there right what you see right right
[8:33] what you see John and send it to the
[8:36] churches
[8:50] heard behind me a great voice as of a
[8:52] trumpet verse 10
[8:57] hello verse 19 write the things which
[9:00] you see and the things which are and the
[9:06] things which shall be Hereafter because
[9:07] John's fixing to right after after
[9:10] chapter or not after chapter 4 but in
[9:13] chapter 4 he is writing things that have
[9:16] not happened yet on this physical earth
[9:18] if I got that say man on the physical
[9:21] earth but when John was caught up he was
[9:23] like brother branham like in the Eagle
[9:25] age he was caught up and he could see
[9:28] and so all the way to this right here
[9:31] all the way in this 8th day man that's
[9:34] why John rejoice that's why you can you
[9:37] can hear nothing but John yelling you
[9:39] think I'm loud all haven't heard John
[9:42] when he screamed I saw his name in the
[9:44] book and saw this whole plan of
[9:46] redemption coming in coming into view
[9:49] just the one man John and he says write
[9:53] the things which thou say the mystery of
[9:55] the Seven Stars and the Seven golden
[9:58] candlesticks the seven stars are the
[9:59] angels we understand that so we went to
[10:02] the church ages and here's the door in
[10:06] heaven Amina Helen in the spirit behold
[10:08] a throne was set in heaven and one sat
[10:09] on the throne now this is what we have
[10:13] to prove from this point forward you got
[10:16] a think we're looking at a natural scene
[10:18] and then we've got to look at something
[10:20] happens in the spirit a spiritual scene
[10:23] ok if I got that because when we're this
[10:28] is what confuses most people in the
[10:31] message is this quote and I'll probably
[10:35] try to bring it next Sunday if we're
[10:37] brother Adam says that the bride goes up
[10:39] in chapter 4:1 and it's not seen until
[10:43] revelations 19
[10:44] well they it just throws everybody into
[10:47] a tizzy all this revelation in between
[10:51] that is not even for us well no it's not
[10:57] but yes it is just right we're not going
[11:02] to naturally be here when the plates
[11:03] well we're not going to naturally be
[11:05] here when these things some of these
[11:07] things happened everybody got that
[11:08] revelation chapter 13 window when the
[11:11] United States beats for the beach we
[11:13] better not be here all right so all but
[11:16] it has symbols and it has a revelation
[11:19] in there because we got to get caught up
[11:22] in the spirit not into the natural thing
[11:25] because I'm gonna throw you a little
[11:27] loop here if I ready come on brother
[11:31] jokes didn't know he's not ready you
[11:33] ready man okay great a man hi
[11:35] revelations 10 1 through 6 it's not to
[11:40] it we're gone I just told you were gone
[11:46] I'm in Revelations for one look for one
[11:51] we go up and come across and here's
[11:54] revelations 19 when we come back riding
[11:57] in the Millennium Ram we're not here
[12:02] this is to the Jews because what's going
[12:06] to happen in Revelations 10 1 they're
[12:08] going to get the literal body angel
[12:10] through two prophets are going to go to
[12:13] Israel and preach to them and bring a
[12:17] people out but then you bring in and
[12:19] interject revelations 10 you should all
[12:22] I stopped at 7 because that's 7 Turk
[12:27] ages and this is still a church a but on
[12:31] chapter 10 verse 4 6 I mean verse 7 you
[12:35] bring in but in the days of the voice of
[12:38] the seventh angel these things back to
[12:45] revelations for will be made known now
[12:49] remember made known by prophecy the
[12:53] brother Branham prophesied one off this
[12:55] thing
[12:55] everybody got that right so now we can
[12:58] see their revelations 10 1 through 6 is
[13:01] the mighty angel coming to see us
[13:04] don't do away with that that mighty
[13:06] angel did come down from heaven this
[13:10] standing from heaven with a shout
[13:12] what's up an archangel that's why it is
[13:16] confusing if you can't read a book of
[13:18] Revelation then I mean if you can't
[13:20] understand the book of Revelation go
[13:23] back to this right here revelation 4 is
[13:26] a scene in heaven alright it's not gonna
[13:30] happen on the earth
[13:32] John's caught up the relations for and
[13:36] revelations 5 everybody got that
[13:39] revelations 5 is the scene in heaven
[13:42] it's the scene that's eternal because it
[13:44] goes all the way back from the Redeemer
[13:46] all the way to where we are kings and
[13:49] priests and where we came to 300 here
[13:51] okay see we're not we're not that here
[13:53] we're gonna see that in our feast days
[13:56] way down the road that we're not kings
[13:59] and priests right here right the
[14:04] thousand-year millennium is to the Jews
[14:06] so that Christ can rule and reign on the
[14:09] throne the twelve
[14:11] we don't ring we don't have anything to
[14:13] do with twelve products we don't even
[14:15] know no I mean sure listen we don't know
[14:17] how to rule Jewish rule if I got that
[14:20] just like the temple we could you go
[14:23] over there right now build the temple no
[14:25] but I'll guarantee there's some Orthodox
[14:27] Jews over there that could go over there
[14:29] and tell you how the whole dimensions
[14:31] from memory the whole dimensions were to
[14:33] put the pot where to put the Labrador to
[14:35] put the Holy of Holies where but we
[14:38] can't why because it's not to us we put
[14:40] all that in here in our temple right
[14:43] it's not pots and pans and these days
[14:47] this we're fixing to talk about but God
[14:49] give them feast days to honor him
[14:52] because we're gonna Street it this
[14:54] afternoon
[14:55] they're not Israel's feet no we're no
[14:58] Bible it talks about Israel's feast
[15:01] every time God mentions it he said
[15:04] they're my fee
[15:05] yeah they're my feet they're mine I'm
[15:10] gonna allow you into my feet and then
[15:13] this is what you're gonna do a man comes
[15:15] remember but now see us is Gentiles
[15:19] think about this them as Jews even back
[15:25] through here if they didn't receive the
[15:27] Holy Ghost a lot of these Jews are going
[15:29] to be given eternal life you got your
[15:32] fifth seal Jude you've got all these
[15:34] different kind of Jews that are that go
[15:36] all the way back to Jesus's time you
[15:38] stay June yeah Nicodemus Brown said
[15:41] Nicodemus and go man you will be given
[15:44] eternal life for what Nocturna Christ
[15:46] down but they didn't accept him code at
[15:48] one time so there's a place for these
[15:53] Jews in the Bible so that's why you've
[15:56] got the Old Testament and that's why
[15:59] you've got this Revelation chapter four
[16:01] and five because remember you're going
[16:05] to get in Revelation six there's your
[16:07] seals we get the spiritual part of the
[16:10] seals now we don't get to the natural
[16:12] part of the sea we get the spiritual
[16:16] part so we're in the spiritual point
[16:18] here and we'll go through that as we go
[16:21] along but just keep remembering two
[16:23] things in your mind this is to the
[16:25] natural Jew or on what I would say is
[16:27] 144,000 mm-hmm because we're going to
[16:30] read in here several places in
[16:32] Revelation 7 or somewhere in there where
[16:35] it says they sang a new song that no one
[16:37] can sing but them right why because our
[16:40] redemption is different than their
[16:43] Redemption yeah yeah it is
[16:45] our Redemption is different to a degrees
[16:47] the same Holy Ghost but we perceive it
[16:50] as Gentiles here they're receiving it
[16:54] while we're gone and they're not bright
[16:56] anymore Christ put them away they're not
[17:00] pride but they do have a place that's
[17:03] why I've got put in the word 144,000
[17:06] would be saved 12,000 from each tribe
[17:08] would be saved because God's not going
[17:11] to
[17:11] forget Israel listen it looks like
[17:13] sometimes that God just forgot Israel
[17:15] when he come on the day of Pentecost he
[17:17] just forgot natural Israel he never
[17:19] forgot naturally even they continue on
[17:23] today the old or thought should you
[17:24] continue to do sacrifices they continue
[17:26] to do but they just don't have
[17:28] everything in place yet so now as we see
[17:32] this revelations for one we go up and
[17:35] then in revelations 19 the bride comes
[17:37] back because we have to go somewhere to
[17:42] let all this happened naturally on earth
[17:44] some stuff tell us like I said it's not
[17:47] to the bride the bride doesn't have a
[17:49] feast day and the bride doesn't have a
[17:51] holy convocation as they have one house
[17:55] is spiritual we celebrate the feast days
[17:59] and our new birth you went through these
[18:03] stages of even the seven feast days
[18:07] because remember there's only there's
[18:09] only justification think kissing baptism
[18:11] goes but you got the four full
[18:13] restoration and then we talked about the
[18:16] other day going up the statue of perfect
[18:18] man again not again you don't want to
[18:21] mean but you justified it hey justify
[18:23] saying five baptism holy goat then you
[18:26] start going through the same thing again
[18:27] right that's the case of that getting
[18:29] baptism holding up and you get up here
[18:31] in the headstone the real you didn't do
[18:33] it you're sanctified completely and then
[18:36] you've become the bride complete the
[18:43] total headship of Christ and which
[18:45] Christ is the head guess what when the
[18:48] head the head tells you what to do the
[18:50] head tells the whole body what to do and
[18:53] that's what we're heading toward and
[18:54] heading to is that great point to where
[18:59] we now remember because when we come
[19:01] back were what were
[19:02] or we ride over here this is the bride
[19:06] but I hear she's the wife I'm a tour so
[19:14] let's get into this remember but then
[19:16] don't say well that's nothing applied to
[19:17] me you make sure every part of the Bible
[19:20] don't ever kick any part of the Bible
[19:21] out cuz it applies to you yeah but maybe
[19:24] it don't apply to you naturally nobody
[19:27] got that that's right alright so the
[19:29] bride goes up in Revelations for one and
[19:34] John tops the bride but see you and I
[19:36] get to look at this scene watch this
[19:38] thing right here and he that set was to
[19:43] look upon like Jasper and sardine stone
[19:47] there was a rainbow around the throne in
[19:50] sight like an emerald now brother Brown
[19:52] tells us that all we see on natural
[19:56] earth is what we see half a rainbow
[20:01] because the coven that's not totally
[20:03] fulfilled yet if I got that understand
[20:07] that then you look it up in a church a
[20:09] book you ready to turn to a book you
[20:11] read that because you get a half but
[20:16] when he's sitting on this throne when
[20:18] we're caught up it says round about the
[20:22] throne in other words completion insight
[20:27] like an emerald now we're brother round
[20:29] talking about that life being an emerald
[20:31] life
[20:31] it was a round light why because God and
[20:35] eternal God's eternal name when he
[20:39] connects us together guess what thanks
[20:41] you're eight alright
[20:46] just a little symbols to look at and
[20:49] round about the throne were four and 20
[20:52] seats aren't here is your seat for 24
[20:55] people oh my god that 24 people and upon
[21:00] the seats I saw four and 20 elders
[21:01] sitting clothed in white raiment and
[21:04] they had on their heads crowns of gold
[21:06] now remember what are these 24 people
[21:12] they are twelve patriarchs in the Old
[21:16] Testament and your Twelve Apostles in
[21:19] the New Testament so John was one of
[21:22] them right so John in simple I John saw
[21:26] itself sitting there and nod he said it
[21:31] is 23 and I'm number 24 he said there's
[21:33] 24 seats he but now remember he's had a
[21:37] vision
[21:38] brother Brown saw itself in the vision
[21:41] when you have a vision or a dream you
[21:42] see yourself in it so there's no problem
[21:44] with it when John to look and see his
[21:48] self but here's my revelation of this
[21:53] John saw itself right here
[21:54] didn't you go to revelations 5 and he
[21:57] sees itself again because there's 24
[21:59] elders there and to me by the time the
[22:02] end of that chapter 5 we're gonna see
[22:04] John that the heavens can't contain his
[22:07] voice why he knew he made it he knew he
[22:11] made it he knew he made what God had
[22:15] told him because remember Jesus stood on
[22:17] earth and he said someone among you will
[22:21] see me coming in power in other words at
[22:24] the end time so remember the thing went
[22:27] around they think was somebody not gonna
[22:28] die before they saw the Lord coming back
[22:30] in in the second coming but they
[22:34] misunderstood that he was talking
[22:36] directly to John but John didn't know it
[22:39] until I believe John went to the Isle of
[22:41] Patmos and that's a pretty horrible
[22:43] place to be but he's like man this is
[22:46] what Jesus was talking about
[22:48] right so he saw himself sitting there so
[22:51] his other brothers the other 12 11
[22:54] apostles he saw them in James John
[22:58] Matthew Mark all did not work but -
[23:03] anyway - 12 Matthias and all the
[23:05] different once he saw that Peter he saw
[23:07] them set them and itself setting their
[23:09] because he's looking at a vision
[23:12] television right and out of the throne
[23:17] proceeded lightnings thunderings and
[23:18] voices so it wasn't a very silent place
[23:22] and there were seven lamps of fire
[23:26] burning before the throne which are the
[23:27] seven spirits of God now there's
[23:29] interchange messengers they were there
[23:31] okay
[23:33] inform inform okay they weren't there in
[23:37] person don't get it in your head that
[23:39] brother Brandon was sitting there and he
[23:41] knew where he was that no good you can't
[23:46] make pre-existence of soul brother Brown
[23:49] how in the world that's people don't
[23:52] understand it they put brother Brown I'm
[23:54] standing here talking to John on Patmos
[23:56] they make him either Mormon or Jehovah
[23:59] Witness right because y'all the witness
[24:03] believe that we were in heaven or
[24:05] Mormons believe we were never talking to
[24:07] God and the devil was sitting there
[24:10] right I'm actually you look it up online
[24:13] you want them and and they're all
[24:16] sitting here when it shows pictures of
[24:18] people sitting around the table and then
[24:20] then Lucifer shows his plan and it's a
[24:23] wonderful plan and then Jesus shows his
[24:25] plan and it's a better plan so God the
[24:28] Father except Jesus is planned anything
[24:32] God sends us all to earth and then the
[24:35] devil gets mad and he takes his people
[24:38] and brings them down here to get back at
[24:41] us now that's a doctrine so if you got
[24:44] brother around standing on the Isle of
[24:46] Patmos in in some form of theophany are
[24:49] they brother Brown himself is standing
[24:51] there you've got three distances all you
[24:54] got a Jehovah Witness doctrine or a more
[24:56] doctrine and I just don't believe that
[24:59] brother Brad said what were you before
[25:01] you were born he said you were nothing
[25:02] from except in the minds of dr. Amen
[25:05] right except in the mind of God that you
[25:07] were an attribute yeah but we weren't
[25:10] standing there watching this whole note
[25:12] you know why cuz John stood there
[25:14] watched it for us that's just I just got
[25:19] there I just got to him because God was
[25:22] that John represented the whole bride so
[25:24] now we can go see John see what John saw
[25:30] and what song what dogs off but see it
[25:34] took a prophet to tell us that John top
[25:37] the entire bride because nobody in any
[25:40] commentary would ever tell you that John
[25:43] tops the entire bride but brother Brown
[25:44] comes down to thank John top the entire
[25:47] bride because we went back and Jesus
[25:48] told them said something you've done it
[25:50] one of yous gonna stand here and see me
[25:52] coming in in other words the second
[25:54] coming and there's John standing there
[25:56] but now as we see and he said John right
[26:00] what you saw and send it to the churches
[26:04] why because the churches need this we
[26:08] need this all right and then below we
[26:10] can see this in simple form and see the
[26:14] seven spirits of God we know it was Paul
[26:17] all these right here forever we know it
[26:20] was these people but it wasn't these
[26:22] people
[26:23] it was the seven spirits that was
[26:24] allocated for that church ain't
[26:29] everybody got that right and before the
[26:33] throne there was a sea glass fluid right
[26:34] here and then we'll stop we can never
[26:35] get there we improve they've in the
[26:38] Millennium
[26:39] and before the throne there was a sea of
[26:42] glass like in the crystal in the midst
[26:44] of the throne and round about the throne
[26:45] were four beasts full of eyes before and
[26:47] behind the three just right here because
[26:50] we've been talking about the line ox
[26:52] Mountain Eagle explain
[26:53] next Sunday the first piece was the line
[26:55] second piece of CAF are an ox
[26:58] the third beats the face of a man and
[27:00] the fourth beast was like a flying eagle
[27:02] that's where you get your so what's
[27:05] around about the throne the Holy Ghost
[27:06] the Holy Ghost moving around the throne
[27:09] we're going to remember gods and
[27:10] movement all the timings in movement
[27:12] moving around about right and what is it
[27:16] it's a symbol of a line simple up adopts
[27:18] symbol of a man and simple I'm not an
[27:22] eagle sitting on a limb he's flying
[27:26] right you can see more when you fly
[27:30] think you see more when you fly you feel
[27:32] awful when you flies to the second on
[27:34] top of a tree
[27:35] alright so we'll stop right there it's
[27:38] 10:00 11:00 so let's go ahead now make
[27:40] sure we go out this door because there's
[27:42] people said still sitting in the middle
[27:43] Trevor some dreams and new people that
[27:47] are here and they don't mind
