[0:05] to

[0:08] and uh we'll just open up in a word of
[0:10] prayer
[0:12] by his grace
[0:14] precious lord jesus we thank you for
[0:16] another opportunity lord uh stand before

[0:38] the sunday school teaching lord and the
[0:40] rest of the stand of your hands in jesus
[0:41] christ's name amen praise the lord jesus
[0:46] all right well we will continue
[0:48] with financial jubilee
[0:50] i'm assuming that everybody still needs
[0:52] money making money working saving
[0:56] so we're going to continue i think when
[0:58] we're all debt free and no longer need
[1:00] money then we may not have to worry
[1:02] about financial jubilee anymore until
[1:04] then we'll keep sharing more and more
[1:08] and certainly financial jubilee as i
[1:10] said before you know this this is it's
[1:11] not
[1:12] books and theories this this is a life
[1:14] lived
[1:15] you know after god started showing me
[1:17] this several years ago now
[1:20] you know it has really transformed my
[1:22] life i live it every day my kids know my
[1:24] wife know it trying to be a steward of
[1:26] what god has placed in front of me to
[1:29] manage
[1:30] and money is just a small thing it's
[1:31] just a reflection of many other things
[1:34] around us my kids my family my job
[1:36] anything that god gives you to manage we
[1:38] want to manage that stu as stewards but
[1:40] financially it just gives you something
[1:42] that you can put your hands on anybody
[1:44] from the youngest to the oldest you can
[1:46] put your hands on it
[1:47] and we know jubilee when the trumpet
[1:49] sounds you can go free if you want to go
[1:51] free it's a choice
[1:53] so i'm just challenging this morning
[1:54] that it's up to us how we take this it
[1:57] all sounds good right until you're
[1:59] outside you're at the store shopping
[2:02] you're thinking about a vehicle your
[2:03] kids thinking about this or that it all
[2:05] sounds good until you start applying it
[2:08] so i pray that you can take it with you
[2:10] as you go
[2:11] and remember is not
[2:13] how much you have
[2:15] or how little you have but it's about
[2:17] managing what you have that's what this
[2:20] is about you can have two dollars but
[2:22] you got to make decisions on what to do
[2:23] with that and that's what god is trying
[2:25] to see how faithful you are with that
[2:27] little bit
[2:30] because you want to flip to the next
[2:31] slide
[2:33] and i think the the the critical piece
[2:35] behind it brothers you can go to the
[2:37] next slide
[2:41] the scripture really stands out it says
[2:43] therefore if you have been not been
[2:45] faithful in the unrighteous man and who
[2:48] will commit to your trust the true
[2:50] riches or another way of saying that
[2:53] another version so if you have not been
[2:55] trustworthy in handling worldly wealth
[2:58] who will trust you with true riches
[3:00] and i believe for sure no doubt this
[3:02] word been preached that's the true
[3:04] riches that we have here
[3:06] but god in his word is saying something
[3:08] that if you can't be
[3:10] trustworthy in
[3:12] worldly wealth money management
[3:14] who will trust to you these true riches
[3:17] and that's certainly what we're here in
[3:19] the statue of a perfect man those are
[3:20] the true riches of god that he has for
[3:22] us his word to reveal it to us
[3:25] but he's saying i'm not going to give
[3:26] you that because he's the one that's
[3:28] doing the evaluation to determine if
[3:30] you're faithful i'm not
[3:32] he's the one that's looking at that how
[3:34] faithful are you with the little things
[3:36] that you have
[3:37] your money
[3:38] because if you can do that if you can
[3:40] learn to say no
[3:42] if you can hold back and have that
[3:43] self-control and that character in
[3:46] handling money
[3:47] that he's saying yeah i'm confident you
[3:49] can handle more you can handle more
[3:52] those true riches
[3:55] so we talked a little bit about last
[3:57] time
[3:58] many of the problems the symptoms that
[4:00] we went through
[4:02] worried about money stressed out trying
[4:04] to handle it trying to get it trying to
[4:05] save it all the things that we deal with
[4:07] with money
[4:08] but one key thing if you go to the next
[4:10] slide brothers
[4:13] go ahead click next
[4:16] go and click next brothers
[4:19] the question we gotta ask is there a
[4:20] difference so when we look at the world
[4:23] is there a difference with how you
[4:24] approaching
[4:26] money management is it the same like the
[4:28] world i mean or you can you stand with
[4:30] someone in the world and you got the
[4:32] same issues the same problems the same
[4:34] concerns
[4:35] and something's not just right because
[4:37] when we look at christ he didn't have
[4:39] the same concerns he did not he did not
[4:42] walk through life just like the world
[4:43] with money management or anything like
[4:45] that he was totally different he trusted
[4:47] god he knew god would supply he knew
[4:49] where the fish was
[4:51] and god supplied so he didn't walk
[4:53] around with the stress he didn't walk
[4:54] with the i gotta earn it i gotta get it
[4:56] it's driving him everything he's
[4:58] thinking about no he did not
[5:00] so there must be a difference with the
[5:01] way we're handling money
[5:04] in that of the world
[5:05] we know that our morals should be
[5:07] different we should be living different
[5:08] our girls should be different or god
[5:09] should be different but what about your
[5:11] pocketbook what about your wallet is
[5:13] that different
[5:14] that's the question
[5:17] let's go to the next
[5:20] so when i think about money management
[5:21] and what i think about it this scripture
[5:23] really well this quote
[5:25] and the power of decision
[5:27] i'm going to take my time and read
[5:29] through this because it it it it just
[5:31] really was amazing my wife and i was
[5:33] listening to this sermon she was
[5:34] listening to it separately and she came
[5:36] down and told me about this i said oh my
[5:38] god this is such a blessing
[5:40] said moses went forward picked packing a
[5:42] stick and we found out the red sea open
[5:45] caused a mighty wind followed that fire
[5:47] the light of god
[5:49] when man walks in the light
[5:51] then the winds follow jesus said
[5:54] tarry you in the city of jerusalem until
[5:55] you are endued with power from on high
[5:58] and they waited until there came from
[6:00] heaven a sound of a rushing mighty wind
[6:02] they walked in light till the wind began
[6:05] to blow amen just step in the light
[6:07] tonight you outside of christ the winds
[6:10] will come back again like they did was
[6:12] on the day of pentecost just keep
[6:14] walking in the light it'll separate the
[6:17] things that was hindering you from one
[6:19] side to the other
[6:21] notice the children of israel walked
[6:23] across the red sea not only in the mud
[6:26] they were on dry ground walking
[6:28] light
[6:29] that's the trouble with the church today
[6:31] you're so loaded down you can't walk
[6:34] light
[6:35] got too many things on you too much
[6:37] hanging around
[6:38] paul said let us lay aside every weight
[6:41] that we may walk light every weight in
[6:43] the senate does easily beset us that we
[6:46] might run with patience the race that's
[6:48] set before us looking to the author and
[6:49] finisher christ
[6:51] walk in the light
[6:52] light footed
[6:54] amen
[6:56] that's what it's about you know if we
[6:57] can get these things off of us these
[6:59] weights these pulls of this world this
[7:02] this world then we can walk in this
[7:04] light light footed
[7:06] amen have that step to having that
[7:08] bounce in your walk when it comes to
[7:10] this word not burdened down and heavy
[7:13] and
[7:14] dead laden and not sure what to do about
[7:17] this decision and money and especially
[7:18] some of you that are older you got kids
[7:20] you got adult children now you got those
[7:23] coming up to be adult children
[7:25] and they need to know these things as
[7:27] well you know we have to know and be
[7:29] able to tell them and have that strength
[7:31] inside of us that character that we see
[7:34] character more important in their life
[7:36] than just saying yes to them
[7:39] okay and those are some of the things
[7:40] you got to deal with you know hey
[7:42] dad i can you co-sign for me
[7:45] dad please
[7:47] i'm i'm gonna pay it back now my son
[7:49] he's not doing this he knows better
[7:51] [Laughter]
[7:53] but those are things i've dealt with
[7:54] with family members okay and you're like
[7:56] oh my god i'm the only one that can
[7:58] rescue them out of this situation
[8:01] no there's a reason why
[8:04] but if you can look through and say no
[8:05] you need the character
[8:07] that's more important to you son or
[8:09] daughter you have to have the character
[8:12] and i can't hurt you
[8:13] by giving
[8:15] but i can
[8:16] help you i can help you learn how to
[8:18] fish i can set things up for you but
[8:20] you're gonna have to walk through this
[8:22] because i see your character as more
[8:24] important and i don't want you to be
[8:27] heavy in this life's journey
[8:29] you have to be light-footed
[8:31] so god can deal with you and they can
[8:33] get that character and learn how to
[8:35] manage this little thing called money
[8:37] then god can start revealing more to
[8:40] them and he will
[8:42] but we have to have that ourselves we
[8:44] have to know how important it is
[8:47] go to the next
[8:52] so we talked about the problem
[8:55] here's a little bit more on that the
[8:57] answer of course understanding the
[8:59] answer this is crown financial ministry
[9:01] and this is one of the ministries out
[9:02] there that helps people
[9:04] certainly as i was going through it and
[9:06] like i said i lost we lost almost
[9:08] everything that seemed like we had
[9:10] and um you know i started seeking god
[9:13] like lord god you
[9:14] something's wrong that's what i said
[9:16] something's wrong i've been paying my
[9:18] tithes
[9:19] i i thought god was gonna bless me
[9:22] miraculously as i said before i knew i
[9:25] said god gonna bless my business oh my
[9:27] goodness they're gonna be thriving
[9:29] that's how i'm gonna get that new
[9:30] vehicle god gonna bless my business oh
[9:32] man it's gonna be all good no that
[9:34] didn't work out that way
[9:35] god had other plans and this is part of
[9:37] his plan because i wouldn't be here now
[9:39] we didn't lose all that money
[9:41] by his grace i wouldn't be sharing this
[9:43] with you
[9:44] it says most of the symptoms of
[9:46] financial problems that families face in
[9:48] today's society business failures
[9:51] foreclosures bankruptcies out of control
[9:54] debt two job families and divorce can be
[9:57] traced to a central problem of ignoring
[10:00] god's financial principles as recorded
[10:03] in his word
[10:04] god's financial principles and
[10:06] instructions are not complicated or hard
[10:08] to understand they were designed to free
[10:10] his people from financial burdens and
[10:12] not to bind them with unattainable sets
[10:15] of dues and don'ts
[10:16] amen all these problems all these things
[10:19] that we see
[10:20] all can be traced to ignoring god's
[10:23] principles for us
[10:25] look at that foreclosures bankruptcies
[10:27] out of control debt two job families
[10:29] divorce all these things and it's
[10:32] getting harder and harder my brothers
[10:34] and sisters certainly for the younger
[10:36] ones it's harder and harder you see so
[10:38] much
[10:39] and they have so many things out there
[10:41] so many choices
[10:43] my goodness if you're looking for a new
[10:44] vehicle they have about
[10:46] 10 different models of the same vehicle
[10:49] you can get the l version the le the xle
[10:53] the platinum the platinum xle
[10:57] my goodness in a start from the base 30
[11:00] 000 by the time you get through it's
[11:01] like 90 000.
[11:03] my goodness and they have a way to pay
[11:06] for that
[11:07] all you got to do is sign right here
[11:09] that's it you can roll out with it
[11:12] and the world knows that and they're
[11:14] marketing that they're after us the
[11:16] devil has a plan believe me he has a
[11:18] plan
[11:19] he knows if he can get us burdened down
[11:23] he has one foot already on you
[11:28] some of the key principles we talked
[11:29] about just want to keep repeating
[11:31] repeating these
[11:33] god owns all the ten percent and the
[11:36] ninety percent never forget that it's
[11:37] not just the tithes that we're paying
[11:39] it's the ninety percent as well he's
[11:42] just giving that to you to manage
[11:44] that's it what are you going to do with
[11:46] that
[11:47] you got to manage his resources
[11:48] diligently you got to you have to be
[11:50] organized you got to take the time i
[11:52] know that's a hard difficult thing
[11:55] a lot of times people say well you know
[11:56] what i'm i'm not a numbers person i'm
[11:58] not this or that
[12:00] guess what the owner
[12:02] he is a numbers person
[12:04] he is so he knows every penny he knows
[12:07] everything that comes across your path
[12:09] so we have to be organized and you can
[12:11] do that in your own way
[12:14] start writing something down somewhere
[12:16] start thinking about when you're going
[12:18] to spin start thinking about those
[12:20] things and think about it's god he knows
[12:23] but think about it that's what we had to
[12:25] do i had to pause and really reflect and
[12:27] that's when god started opening all this
[12:29] up
[12:30] don't waste your money it's part of your
[12:32] time
[12:33] you know my daughter she bought we
[12:35] bought her some some a jacket and um
[12:39] you know i bought it happy to buy it for
[12:41] you know and
[12:42] a couple days later she came back as
[12:44] well it was about about 30 days later
[12:46] and um
[12:47] alicia brought it in said well she's not
[12:49] going to wear it she doesn't want it
[12:51] like okay there's a 30 days up on this
[12:54] thing
[12:56] look that it was one day late
[12:58] i'm like
[13:00] does she know
[13:02] this is an hour of her dad's time life
[13:05] she can't waste this thing
[13:10] but that's it it's an hour of my life if
[13:13] you don't want it you tell me right away
[13:15] you don't want it
[13:16] but by god's grace we called they took
[13:18] it back so i was happy about that
[13:21] but that's how you got to look at it
[13:23] it's an hour of her dad's life my life
[13:26] whatever i spend if i'm wasting it's my
[13:28] life you're going to work every single
[13:30] day putting in those hours that's your
[13:33] time
[13:34] you're getting in return for that time
[13:36] some money
[13:37] you waste it
[13:38] that's your life what you're spending on
[13:41] so watch that
[13:43] delayed gratification learning to wait
[13:45] that's in everything we have to learn to
[13:48] wait on god
[13:50] reading just a scripture of david as he
[13:52] getting he was getting older many of you
[13:54] probably remember the story and before
[13:56] he had crowned solomon or announced
[13:58] solomon to be king
[14:00] his brother jumped in there
[14:03] his brother said hey dad's old he hadn't
[14:05] said anything about the kingship i'm
[14:08] next in line i believe epsilon and the
[14:10] other brothers were dead he's like you
[14:12] know what
[14:13] i'm i'm in
[14:15] no need for me asking i'm going there's
[14:17] no need to wait and he went and claimed
[14:19] that kingship
[14:20] ahead of time ahead of time
[14:24] and he had his parties he brought
[14:25] everybody he was celebrating having a
[14:27] good time
[14:29] good time
[14:30] but he didn't invite solomon he didn't
[14:32] invite the prophet
[14:33] because he knew something was just not
[14:35] right with them they wait they do things
[14:37] right
[14:38] huh we ain't going to invite them we're
[14:39] going to go forward and they didn't wait
[14:42] of course that gave nathan that prophet
[14:44] that time to get with bashiba and said
[14:45] hey go talk to david let's do this thing
[14:48] right
[14:49] ask david
[14:50] david you did mention you're going to
[14:52] make solomon king
[14:54] is that still good
[14:56] if so we're about ready
[15:00] david says sure
[15:01] crowned him did it right waited
[15:04] and of course you know that cost that
[15:05] brother his life later on
[15:08] and he was clinging to the altar for
[15:10] forgiveness but he didn't know how to
[15:11] wait
[15:12] he didn't know how to wait maybe it
[15:14] started very simple
[15:16] when he got things that he didn't know
[15:17] how to wait for
[15:19] so by the time he came to this very very
[15:21] important decision in his life he
[15:22] thought he could do the same thing
[15:25] so we got to learn to wait wait on god
[15:27] wait on him to supply
[15:29] as i said before you know you look at
[15:31] these vehicle prices and it's like it's
[15:32] scary i mean i'm telling you
[15:35] 80 000
[15:37] 80 90 000 for like regular vehicles i'm
[15:41] like this is crazy
[15:43] but you can pay it off in six years this
[15:45] sign right here
[15:47] so now you think about if you wait
[15:49] you wait but see what we challenge with
[15:52] is like i can't do it
[15:54] i can't save 80 000
[15:57] that's impossible that's what the world
[15:59] tells you
[16:00] so you can sign right here there's an
[16:02] easy way no
[16:04] god wants you to build that character
[16:07] he's never saying you can't do that or
[16:09] you can't get that or you can't have
[16:11] that but he said it do it god's way
[16:13] but i guarantee you you get 90 000 in
[16:16] your hands you're going to think very
[16:18] differently whether you're going to put
[16:19] all that character building that you've
[16:21] built
[16:22] for
[16:23] three to five years of major sacrificing
[16:26] and everything that you're getting and
[16:27] you're putting aside for this bucket of
[16:30] a new vehicle that you want
[16:32] you think about the character you're
[16:34] gonna get from that oh my god you by the
[16:37] time you get ten thousand like oh lord i
[16:38] can't believe i got ten thousand this is
[16:40] amazing twenty thousand lord
[16:42] wow i've set this aside thirty thousand
[16:46] my goodness
[16:47] this is i can't believe it fifty
[16:50] thousand
[16:52] hold on do i want that vehicle
[16:55] sixty thousand oh god lord have mercy
[16:58] lord jesus uh should i be doing this
[17:01] ninety thousand no i don't think i want
[17:04] that vehicle
[17:05] no you know a 5 000 vehicle looking
[17:07] really nice right now
[17:09] by the grace of god and i still have 75
[17:12] 000 left
[17:13] my goodness
[17:15] that's it
[17:16] and you got something worth so much more
[17:19] character
[17:20] wow that's what god is trying to get to
[17:22] us that character but then you take that
[17:25] and you apply it to his word it's the
[17:26] same thing no different he want to see
[17:29] that we have control
[17:31] we got it we know what we can do but we
[17:33] have to wait on god
[17:35] lord i got this money
[17:37] is it your will
[17:39] father god if it is then lord thank you
[17:41] if not
[17:42] thank you lord jesus
[17:44] because that's the power and the
[17:45] character we're gonna need to handle all
[17:47] that god wants to give us
[17:50] my goodness if we're gonna have power to
[17:52] raise dead saints out of the grave it's
[17:54] going to take some character
[17:56] see we look at things just you know
[17:58] everything is spiritual but what about
[18:00] the natural things what about if you
[18:01] have that power and someone's spouse is
[18:04] coming to you saying raise my husband or
[18:07] raise my daughter for me you got the
[18:10] power
[18:12] oh my god if every
[18:16] oh please please
[18:18] i'm dying without it and we don't know
[18:22] then what we're going to do
[18:24] so god knows what we can handle
[18:27] but if we can do these simple things and
[18:29] he knows already he can trust us
[18:31] by his grace
[18:33] amen
[18:34] go to the next
[18:38] principle five avoid debt like the curse
[18:41] the blessing of the lord and maketh rich
[18:43] and he added no sorrow with it i always
[18:46] think of that you know so when someone
[18:47] comes to you and they've taken out a
[18:50] hefty loan and they're like thank god
[18:51] this is a blessing
[18:53] before you say amen say
[18:55] okay
[18:57] okay because there should be any sorrow
[18:59] with what god is adding to you
[19:02] shouldn't be and many times the things
[19:04] that we get in the world that we think
[19:06] gets us rich there's many many sorrows
[19:08] there's arguments there's divorce
[19:09] everything that we talked about that
[19:11] happens
[19:12] and so you can kind of start
[19:13] understanding what is god in and what is
[19:15] god not in
[19:17] of course we know the and go to the end
[19:19] watch the end the ant is always working
[19:21] gathering preparing being diligent we
[19:25] can do that our lives are constantly
[19:28] changing every single day going to
[19:30] different seasons of our lives and if we
[19:32] can start out on this the young i mean i
[19:35] challenge all the young people
[19:37] wherever you are in your life
[19:39] oh my if you can apply these principles
[19:42] to your life
[19:43] wow you will see the hand of god
[19:47] of course the best investment is giving
[19:49] giving to the kingdom of god your return
[19:51] is waiting at home in heaven
[19:54] and we know the scripture acts 20 35 it
[19:56] says is more blessed to give than to
[19:59] receive and that's something we got to
[20:01] work on that's something we all got
[20:03] something i got to work on where you
[20:05] really feel that blessing you know
[20:07] somebody give you something it's like
[20:09] thank you lord they oh i'm blessed
[20:12] the bible said a little bit reversed it
[20:14] said it's more blessed for you to give
[20:17] than to receive
[20:18] so those are the things that we have to
[20:20] just keep working through
[20:22] contentment contentment has learned i'm
[20:24] going to read
[20:25] first timothy 6.
[20:29] i really really like that this reading
[20:36] first timothy 6
[20:38] 6-11
[20:40] and the scriptures are just full full of
[20:43] all of god's principles
[20:45] that he's laying out for us
[20:48] amen by the grace of god
[20:54] the right scripture here
[21:02] i believe that's first timothy
[21:05] as my pages get stuck together here
[21:12] okay
[21:23] that's the scripture
[21:26] maybe a second timothy
[21:30] but it's godliness with contentment is
[21:32] great gain
[21:34] amy is it first
[21:44] why am i not saying that okay
[21:52] let me know if someone has that
[22:00] okay
[22:01] okay here we go
[22:04] six six yeah that's right but godliness
[22:06] with contentment is great gain for we
[22:08] brought nothing into this world and is
[22:10] certain we can carry nothing out
[22:13] very plain and having food and raiment
[22:15] let us therefore be content there with
[22:18] be content
[22:19] now look at that principle he just said
[22:21] if you got food and clothes that's where
[22:23] you start be content right there
[22:26] you know if we start getting ourselves
[22:28] caught up beyond that that's where the
[22:30] devil is able to set in now he's not
[22:32] saying he never said that we can't have
[22:33] all these other things but he said keep
[22:35] that that contentment to start off with
[22:38] know that you're okay
[22:39] if you got food and you got clothes
[22:43] start right there if you got that then
[22:45] you're fine
[22:46] but they that will be rich fall into
[22:48] temptation and snare and into many
[22:50] foolish and hurtful lusts which drown
[22:53] men in destruction
[22:54] and perdition
[22:56] for the love of money is the root of
[22:57] evil of all evil
[22:59] which while some coveted after they have
[23:02] aired from the faith and pierced
[23:04] themselves through with many sorrows
[23:07] but thou o man of god flee these things
[23:09] and follow after righteousness godliness
[23:11] faith love patience meekness
[23:14] fight the good fight lay hold on eternal
[23:16] life
[23:17] oh my you see how he just taken that
[23:19] word and and telling us
[23:21] yes
[23:22] food and clothes you got that there are
[23:24] certain things that you definitely need
[23:26] but be content don't pursue pursue these
[23:30] other things which we already know he
[23:32] says seek ye first the kingdom of god
[23:34] now i'm telling you that is difficult to
[23:36] do
[23:37] it's difficult when you look at all
[23:38] these things and our minds are worried
[23:40] about this you're worried about your
[23:41] kids you're worried about providing
[23:42] you're worried about security you're
[23:43] worried about
[23:44] what you're gonna do when you retire
[23:46] you're worried about all of these things
[23:47] that come to your mind but god is saying
[23:51] be content he already knows what you
[23:53] need
[23:55] now you have to take all of his word as
[23:56] far as being diligent with what you have
[23:58] thinking about what you're spending so
[24:00] it doesn't mean that we'd be content and
[24:03] i'm not going to be diligent i'm going
[24:05] to spend whatever i want because god is
[24:06] going to take care of me no it's being
[24:09] all of his word being a wise steward all
[24:12] of these principles
[24:14] and that will keep us on that right path
[24:18] in second chronicles i want to show you
[24:19] how important it is to stay with the
[24:23] word go to the next slide
[24:27] so this is king solomon and we knew
[24:29] solomon and we know how he asked god
[24:32] when he started out for wisdom and god
[24:34] said i'm gonna give you that i'm gonna
[24:35] give you everything else as well
[24:38] and as we get through solomon's life we
[24:40] see solomon past all the kings of the
[24:42] earth in riches and wisdom
[24:44] and all the kings of the earth sought
[24:46] the presence of solomon to hear his
[24:48] wisdom that god had put in his heart
[24:51] and they brought every man his present
[24:53] vessels of silver and vessels of gold
[24:56] and the king made silver in jerusalem as
[24:59] stones and they brought onto solomon
[25:02] horses out of egypt and out of all lands
[25:07] wow so we're seeing solomon as he's
[25:10] growing and power and wealth and
[25:12] godly blessings
[25:14] you know and um it's hard to believe
[25:17] that you know
[25:18] as i look at us in america
[25:21] solomon didn't have all the things that
[25:23] we have believe it or not
[25:25] we got any restaurant any meal any kind
[25:28] of desire that you want if you want some
[25:30] indian food and go get some indian you
[25:32] want chinese and get chinese you want
[25:34] some burgers and get some burgers
[25:36] whatever we want we have all these
[25:37] things right at us
[25:39] and if you're whatever you want you can
[25:40] sign and get credit you can do whatever
[25:41] you want so we have a lot of these
[25:43] things that we can acquire as well
[25:46] but during those times of course he had
[25:48] silver and gold and horses out of egypt
[25:52] now when you look at that nothing jumps
[25:53] out to you right away okay well yeah
[25:56] thank god for blessing let's go to the
[25:57] next scripture
[25:58] prior to that time when the children of
[26:00] israel were coming out
[26:02] this is what god told them in this whole
[26:04] chapter in deuteronomy it's like the
[26:06] section is talking about when you get a
[26:08] king and some instructions for the king
[26:12] he says when thou art come into the land
[26:14] in which the lord thy god giveth thee
[26:16] thou shalt in any wise set him king over
[26:19] thee whom the lord thy god shall choose
[26:21] so there should be somebody that god
[26:23] choose now king
[26:25] but he shall not multiply horses to
[26:28] himself
[26:30] what
[26:31] nor cause the people to return to egypt
[26:34] to the end that he should multiply
[26:35] horses
[26:37] god say king when you come in there
[26:39] don't get a lot of horses
[26:41] don't go down to egypt and get horses
[26:44] and you see solomon doing exactly that
[26:47] collecting these horses from egypt
[26:51] that's why god put that scripture in
[26:52] there he got a lot of horses from egypt
[26:54] you would read that and be like well
[26:55] what what what okay
[26:57] but god had told him in the word don't
[27:00] do that neither shall he multiply wives
[27:03] to himself
[27:04] solomon you don't need a thousand
[27:08] don't do it
[27:10] if you do it your heart will turn away
[27:12] neither shall he greatly multiply to
[27:15] himself silver and gold
[27:18] don't do that solomon
[27:21] that's how simple it is
[27:22] but he told he said when you do when you
[27:25] sit upon the throne of the kingdom this
[27:27] is what you should do you should write
[27:29] him a copy of the law in a book out of
[27:32] that which is before the priest of the
[27:33] levites and it shall be with him and he
[27:36] shall read therein all the days of his
[27:38] life
[27:39] obviously solomon didn't do that because
[27:41] he didn't read this section
[27:43] that he may learn to fear the lord his
[27:45] god to keep all the words of the law and
[27:48] these statues to do them that his heart
[27:51] be not lifted up above his brethren that
[27:53] he turn not aside from the commandment
[27:56] to the right hand or to the left to the
[27:58] end that he may prolong his days and his
[28:00] kingdom he and his children
[28:02] in the midst of israel
[28:05] that's what god wanted him to do
[28:07] hold on hold on to that word
[28:11] that's it and you see how simple these
[28:13] principles are in his word that's how
[28:16] easy it was for solomon
[28:18] don't get horses god has already told us
[28:20] this word avoid debt
[28:23] manage diligently all those principles
[28:25] that we talked about those are things in
[28:26] god's word that we can apply and it's
[28:28] many many many more that we can hold on
[28:30] to
[28:31] so take that my brothers and sisters
[28:33] take that word of god this gps as he
[28:37] told solomon hold on to it keep it read
[28:40] it take these things that we're learning
[28:41] from god and apply it to your life god
[28:44] bless you all
[28:47] [Applause]
