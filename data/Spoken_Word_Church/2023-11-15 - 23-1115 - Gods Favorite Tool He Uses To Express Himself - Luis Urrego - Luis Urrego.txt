Bible this this evening to 2 Corinthians chapter 12 2 Corinthians chapter 12 I want to talk about um a little strange title but I I called it God's favorite tool that he uses to express himself amen and uh God has tools amen even Satan is a tool in his hand remember that and there is this particular thing that God loves to use in order to Express himself that we're going to read here in 2 Corinthians chapter 12 and so let's just bow our heads before we read our heavenly father we just thank you Lord Jesus once again for the opportunity that you give us father to open back the pages of your word we realize Lord God that we're insufficient within ourselves Lord we we're not even worthy Lord God to even read these words father God but Lord you've made us worthy Lord through your blood Lord Jesus Through the Redemptive process heavenly father of of the your death burial and Resurrection Lord God and now Lord we as Born Again Believers Lord God have access and and and have complete father God uh uh Redemption father God through through your through your word Lord God and and so Lord we just thank you Father God for the opportunity that you give us this evening we pray that you

strengthen her strengthen the family Lord Jesus and and I pray dear God that you would also Lord just continue to give brother Bob a speedy recovery watch over brother Wade as he's traveling Lord God and Lord we want to commit this service into your hands father God you you speak to the hearts as you see fit Lord God use my lips Lord God to say only what that that that you'd want me to say Lord Jesus father God I commit myself into your hands now and this service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen amen 2 Corinthians 12:7 says unless I should be exalted this is Paul speaking unless I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given me to me a thorn in the flesh amen Paul's speaking here and saying that unless I get I get I get exalted by the things that that God has revealed to me God gave me a little prod gave me a little something a little Thorn to keep me humble and we thank God for that cuz if Paul needed it we certainly needed it amen to keep keep us keep us humble keep us under his his control and there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted above measure for this thing I besought the Lord Thrice that it might depart from me so he asked the Lord three times for that to be taken away from him and he said unto me the Lord said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee in other words my grace is enough for you for my strength is made perfect in weakness amen my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmity ities that the power of Christ May rest upon me so here's Paul speaking and bringing out his problem and then after God tells him uh my grace is sufficient so don't worry Paul just keep moving on then Paul changes his mindset and says most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me amen what a strange thing to say Amen to glory in the things that you are going through I mean not not just infirmities like sicknesses but even the problems that we have domestic problems Financial issues amen God will not give us more than what we can handle that's that's a promise in the word so we rather we we better we better just just might as well just glory in them because in glory in them amen you bring you bring those around around you and say wow that person can praise the Lord even in the situation that they're in and it might give them strength amen praise the Lord Jesus you may be seated this afternoon amen so and so and it it said then he said unto me my grace is sufficient to thee for my strength is made perfect in in weakness amen and that right there is the tool that God likes to use just started off right right there amen God loves to use the tool of weakness in order to express himself amen praise God I remember one time in the scriptures where where uh uh the Bible says that that he has placed God has placed his treasure in Earth and vessels amen what are those Earth and vessels that's you and Meen amen that that is that you and me as weaklings amen because we have no power within our ourselves we have no strength within ourselves we come to this world Amen as babies not having dependent upon Upon A a mother upon someone to take care of us amen and if it wasn't for God Amen even from the time that we came out of the womb amen where would we be in this day where would we be in the hour that we're living in amen if it wasn't for God Amen for us to for us to be hoty and and and and and and and proud and and and and some even blaspheme God not knowing that it's God that's making even the the heart that's beating inside their chest it's Goden and God could stop that right there at any moment amen and it would be it would be there would be nothing amen but God pleased it pleased God to put his word or his treasures in a bride in this hour Amen in Earth and vessels that you and you now you we walk around the world in the day that we're living and nobody's going to think that you are the bride of Christ that's the bride of Christ she looks like that he looks like that they would not think oh yeah they'll say you're a Christian but they don't understand the power that dwells in a born again Christian amen that's part of the body of Christ amen the Bride of Jesus Christ in this hour is powerful and she does does have to show it but the works amen of God Amen will be expressed through her because why the Bible say brother brandom said that the voice is in the bride now amen we're not replacing the the we're not replacing God no we just speak as God speaks amen praise God so we speak amen because the word of God says it and we're not we're we're not replacing God Amen there's no other like Jesus Christ but the voice is in the bride now amen now I didn't say that brother brandham said that so you're can argue with him praise God we believe that he was a prophet right amen praise the Lord now real quickly brother brandom talks about this in in the uh in Christ The Mystery of God revealed and he talks about the three ways that God wanted to express himself amen and and and and and and the three-fold purpose that he had amen and and one of the ways is the is first is uh to express his completely through Christ amen and we know that he came and he was born and and took up the the the human our human ways and and became a man and to suffer and to to work and to sweat and and to do everything like we so that he could de so so that he could show amen and understand what you and I go through amen and so that he could become our Kinsman amen so that he could uh properly redeem us amen cuz there was no other way for us to be redeemed if we didn't have a Kinsman just like us to redeem us amen and brother Brandon says that God who who was a spirit and and and and and and and took up all space and time and and there was no way for him to redeem us unless he expressed himself in human form amen and he did that through our Lord Jesus Christ and we're just thankful for that amen praise God but he not only wanted to just leave it at Christ because many people sometimes they just put it and leave it just all on Christ but what he put in Christ amen God has also poured into into his church amen praise God and second that he wanted to have the preeminence in his church which is his body amen the bride in in this hour amen do you believe that praise God do you believe that you're a part of that body amen he says here till he could have the preeminence to express himself through them amen praise God and that's what God wants in this hour amen he he just doesn't want to just give a Bible and and and and and and that's it uh we could all just read the Bible and that's it amen but he he wants a living word in this hour amen he he wants you to live the Bible praise God and and so many people can read the Bible but not many people can live it right and that's what the bride of Christ is here to do Amen to express him Amen to express the expressed God praise the Lord and thirdly he wanted to restore this is his this third uh uh uh manifold uh um that the way he wanted to express himself third to restore the kingdom to its rightly position that fell by sin by the first Adam amen so those are three things that God the way he wanted to express himself amen through Christ through you and also through this his kingdom amen he's going to express himself amen through this thing is coming back to an Eden Eden Eden form amen praise God now we we know amen that we are not going to be able to rule this Kingdom unless the kingdom of God first is ruling in US amen and what is the kingdom of God it is the holy spirit praise the Lord amen when we don't know how to rule our own kingdom we won't be able to rule and Reign properly there amen so God is going to restore and God is restoring amen but it has to be it has to start with you amen inside inside out praise the Lord sometimes we try to do it from the outside in and it doesn't work it's it's like brother bandam said you're just putting peacock feathers on a buzzard carcass amen you're just trying to look good but in reality you have you don't have the goods amen and we don't want to be that way in this hour we want to know that we know that we know that we're born again praise God that we are filled with the Holy Ghost and that God Amen is ready has a willing vessel you are a willing vessel that he could express himself through in this hour amen praise the Lord brother random continues to say here in the mystery of Christ revealed but he had to let put man on free moral agency to fall he had to do it so that he might be a savior amen that's right to display what's in him see his attribute of Savior something had to be lost and you know uh for me this was uh this quote and then actually this message was what opened my eyes when I first came into the message it was the first message that I actually read um and God does things in such peculiar ways but yet they're his perfect ways oh amen because as some of you all have heard my testimony I have always I before that time that was in 1999 I had always asked and wrestled in my mind I was a Christian of course you know I went through my rebellious period period you know and and and I I when I did things of the world but but I wanted to come back at the age of 19 started serving the lord but I always asked myself I said Lord why is it that if you know the beginning from the end if you are Eternal all knowing then why did you create Adam and Eve and you knowing that they were going to fall seems like a legitimate question right amen and God there in Columbia 1999 not Columbia South Carolina but Columbia South America I we a cousin of my mom's had learned about the message he gave us some message books and out of all the 1100 messages this was the message that I picked up Christ The Mystery of God revealed it was in Spanish and as I was reading through that through that through that uh through that sermon I came across this and it exactly answered the question that I had always in my mind that I just talked about and I came running out of that room and I I was like was looking for my parents I was like Mom Dad look look what I just read look what I it struck me it did something to me amen amen because it revealed to me God's purpose and that I'm no accident and that you're not an accident amen and that God Amen had to allow sin to come had to allow for Adam to make the choice that he made in order for God to display his attributes because if there was nothing nothing to uh sick that he could not show that he was a Healer and if there was nothing that that that was that was lost he could not show that he was a savior and I was lost and I'm glad amen that he was able to with show that attribute amen so that he could save me amen amen and if he could save you too praise the Lord and I just thank God for that and that never struck me and then it just pil the revelations piled on after that praise the Lord for that amen praise God and you know what when something's a revelation Satan can't even take that away from me amen that's why I don't understand amen how can people leave this word I don't I I don't get it that's right something was not revealed exactly it was just head knowledge but when something is revealed amen the devil amen the demons out of hell amen cannot even take that away from you amen do you think that God could do you think Satan could take away from you uh one God once you know that there's only one God Amen and it's not a trinity that I believed uh throughout the seven Church ages of denominations that I went [Laughter] through you can't take that away from me now amen one God praise the Lord Jesus what a wonderful thing amen and brother Brandon continues to say here amen yes give the Lord Praise amen and the very thing that man fell and become lost he become the savior of that taking his own law and he could not do it as the great Jehovah that covered all space time see he couldn't do it and he had to become a man and he took kinship ship with the man that was lost amen and become a man God made flesh amen praise the Lord Jesus and if if if you I'm going through that sermon again Christ The Mystery of God revealed and uh I encourage you all to go through that it's a it's a powerful sermon amen praise the Lord Jesus now le let's talk about the word expression for just a moment and and and and this is what the dictionary says the word is it says the process of making known one's thoughts or feelings ings amen isn't that what God wanted to do amen God had thoughts from the beginning amen and it wasn't just he didn't want them just in in his head he didn't want it to just be head knowledge he wanted to express those thoughts amen and that's when that's what and that's when he spoke amen and things started coming into existence amen and that's what words are when you say something that is a thought expressed amen you have to think it first then say it that's the reason why sometimes somebody says something to you and they say well I was just kidding but wait a second you had to think that first before you actually said it I was just messing around brother I'm just joking I'm just joking no wait a second you have to think that first right before you say it now sometimes you know some people you do question that you know they just blurt things out and but but but that is exactly you have to think amen before you say something and so so it was so with God Amen he had thoughts amen he had you in his mind but it wasn't that wasn't enough he wanted to fellowship with you he wanted to to have communion with you amen he wanted to have amen a a relationship with you and you can't have a relationship amen with Just Thoughts amen right they have to be expressed they have to be in in in in word form and then come and be expressed amen physically praise the Lord because the word I believe the word is a continual Creator amen when God said let there be amen I believe that word is still going praise the Lord he's continuing to create amen that's something the devil hates because he can't do it amen God's word amen is eternal amen so what he said from the beginning amen continues all throughout eternity praise the Lord amen and it's a continual Creator amen hallelujah and and so the word expression means the process of making known one's thoughts or feelings the act of making your thoughts feelings Etc known by speech writing or some other method you know you we we take a look at for example the famous man in history who who expressed their own thoughts through through uh you take Shakespeare for example he expressed his thoughts through through dramas and through poetry and through writings and and and that was that was his strength in order to express what was in him right amen you take for example uh the famous scientist that Nicola Tesla now who's ever heard of Nicola Tesla amen he lived around the time of Einstein amen but Nicola Tesla amen he was a scientist and that was the way he expressed his his beliefs or the or his his theories or his things amen through his his tests and his experiments and and through science that was his strength right right you take actors today for example you take I don't know Will Smith or Denzel Washington or uh the or any of these actors today they express whatever role they're playing amen because that is their strength right that is what they were called to do I guess but God is not so God expresses his strength through weakness they express their strength amen they they express their thoughts through their strength God expresses his thoughts through weakness think about that amen amen that's what that's the tool that God likes to use and so we we are the weak ones amen we are weak amen we're nothing but sheep at least we should be that's right amen and when we're not amen following the shepherd the way we should be amen then we're just we're just goats then amen we're just acting like goat we're sheep acting like goats amen because sometimes we know better but yet we still want a butt and we still want to rebel and we still don't want to follow the shepherd amen so therefore he has to take his his his staff his crooked staff with the hook and bring us back into the fall and say get back in here you're one of mine I'm not losing not one amen get back in the fold amen and quit your cutting up and I'm thankful for that rod and that staff praise the Lord Jesus amen that brings us in order amen and he does it lovingly amen he doesn't bang and pow and then brings them brings them amen he does it lovingly right he does come on maybe a little jerk that they feel it and they know that he means business but that's what that staff is there for that's what David said amen we'll read it here in just a moment David said thy rod and thy staff they they guide me in Psalms chapter 23 praise the Lord now there is a different difference between a rod and a staff we're going to look at that here in just a moment praise God but God he expresses his mind through weaknesses the world these these artists and these people amen they express their mind through their strengths God expresses his mind through weaknesses through disappointments so that the world may think we are but that's what God likes to use amen amen God likes to use something that looks like it's is is is is is almost at the verge of of of of dying or at The Verge amen and that's where God likes to work best amen the weakest Christian on their knees puts the devil Amen to to on the run right amen the weakest Christian how much how much then a strong Christian can do come on Amen if a weak Christian can do that how much more a strong Christian amen praise God hallelujah amen so Paul said it here in 2 Corinthians 12:9 we just read it he said he said here and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me it's so awesome Amen to think it's striking that that that he says my strength is made perfect in weakness that wasn't Paul saying that that was God telling Paul that my strength is made perfect through weak situations through weak weak bodies through weak areas in your life amen God can show his strength through that amen amen and sometimes you know we go through life and we wonder why Lord this has you why can't this be taken away from me right right now and then I I I keep wrestling with this you know I love you Lord I I but I just can't get away from this I I'm struggling I'm fighting amen and God says just keep leaning on my word I'm going to use that to make you a better Christian amen yes sir no matter what it is in your life exactly God uses the weakest things amen the weakest area in your life to make you stronger praise the Lord Jesus amen now let's look at Moses's Rod here for just a moment how many want to do that amen praise the Lord I want us to turn to Exodus chapter 4 Exodus chapter 4 we're going to read verses 1-5 uh and then a few more verses but if we look at Moses's Rod amen Moses's Rod represented Moses's weakness because you think about this now Moses had um had left Egypt because he somebody saw him killing an Egyptian because he was trying to defend one of his countrymen right so he thought he was doing a good deed but he ended up in his own good deed thinking that he was doing something good he ended up doing amen something that he wasn't supposed to do he says well surely this thing is found out and people know about this so he takes off and he runs to median he he gets married married and and and he becomes a shepherd and he thinks that in his life that that is what that's all he's going to do amen he created his own plan this is what I'm doing he you know forget it I you know I can't go back to Egypt sure I had I had good times there at at that church and and in those days we would you know that was that was good that was wonderful amen but I just can't go back I I I've got to continue I got to continue living yeah I got to raise a family and and and I've just this is what I choose right and so it was all about him then it was I I I me me me and that's what we do sometimes amen we put God out of out of the the the picture and we just say I I I me me me and and and and uh we want to live to an island to ourselves and and and just move on with our life and that's what Moses thought that he was able to that he was going to be able to do right but God Amen wasn't going to allow that God had a purpose for Moses amen so we see here in MO in Exodus chapter 3 God Appears to Moses in a burning bush he speaks to him and then here in chapter 4 Moses uh replies and he says and Moses answered and said but behold now here he he became a goat all the 40 years that he was away not doing what he was called to do and he ended up becoming a goat instead of a sheep so what God does he's preparing well we'll just read it and Moses answered and said but behold they will not believe me you see that's what happens amen when we when we stay away from the will of God the will of God is for you to come to church the will of God for you to be in his word amen amen we become goats but but but you know behold they will not believe me nor hearken unto my voice for they will say the Lord hath not appeared unto thee and the Lord said unto him what is that in thine hand it's not that God didn't know what it was in his hand but he wanted Moses to tell him what was in his hand what do you have in your hand Moses and he said a rod now I said earlier that a rod and a staff are two different tools that Shepherds use uh they use both of them interchangeably and it's not the same thing and I know sometimes we look and we see sometimes that he one them the the Crooked one is actually the staff the rod is actually a smaller stick that that is used to protect the Sheep to protect them against animals he also the the shepherd also uses it as a walking stick but it was it was almost like a club and he was able to wield that thing much easier it w and he would also use that that that Rod to uh to count the Sheep as well and it makes me think am man about Jesus Christ how he gave that that Parable amen about the the the the Lost Sheep amen he lost he lost Lo 99 were found you know 99 were not lost amen but that one was was was lost amen how did he know how many he had well it was a rod that they used to use amen and with that Rod he would count the shepherd counts the Sheep amen and he he's not banging them upside the head he's just kind of you know prodding them and and and and he counts the sheep and to let him know how many sheep because he knows how many sheep he's supposed to have amen he knows amen he's not going to lose not one this day in the in the hour that we're living in Saints he's not going to lose not one amen he knows amen who he predestinated to to be conformed to His Image amen they will come amen you came you aren't going to be lost amen someway somehow he'll go out and find you amen praise God even if he has to pick you up and put you on his shoulders break your leg amen and put you on his shoulders but he's going to mend you afterwards amen whatever he has to do amen but he's he's going to bring him he's not going to lose not one but but this Rod amen is is is is used for protection amen and then the staff is used mainly for the Sheep amen to guide the Sheep to to uh to to lead them amen and so what Moses says here is that he says he has a rod so according to what he said look like he had the the the club is what he had amen and so and we know that a rod and a staff they're made out of wood and wood represents Humanity amen so here is this Ro rod and this in this staff that is made of wood it's it's weak it's not strong unless the human wields it and and uses it amen but it's nothing within itself yet God asks Moses what is that at thy RA in thy hand after Moses tries to give an excuse you don't want to be used by me all right I'm going to use a stick instead and he said now watch what the what the Lord said to to Moses and he and he said cast it on the ground and so Moses cast it on the ground and it became a serpent and then Moses fled from before it in other words he got scared and he ran right I think I would too snakes just looking at him amen make give you the the give you chills amen imagine amen the staff that you were holding in your hand amen and when you release and when he released it amen God could then use it amen it's when you let go of whatever you're you're let you you have a hold of Amen that God can actually use in your life amen and if you don't let go of that amen then God can't do anything about it but when you let it go amen God can take a hold of it amen and use it for for his glory am and to show you his power amen amen what if mooses Moes would have still held on to it God was not would not be able to to to change it into a into a stick into a serpent amen and he said cast it on the ground and he cast it on the ground and it became a serpent and the Lord said unto Moses put forth thine hand and take it by the tail pick it up Moses you just now saw it turn into a snake your stick turned into a snake now why don't you go ahead and pick it up imagine if you were Moses I don't know if if I I would I would I really need [Laughter] Revelation put forth thine hand and take it by the tail and he put forth his hand Moses put forth his hand and caught it and it became a rod in his hand amen right so it became a a rod again what it was originally meant to be amen it became a rod in his hand that they may believe that the Lord verse 5 that they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob hath appeared unto thee and then let's skip down to verse 10 and Moses said unto the Lord here's Moses again with his excuses oh my Lord after he had just seen what just happened I am not eloquent neither that here to for nor since thou has spoken un to thy servant but I am slow of speech and a slow tongue and the Lord said unto him who hath made man's mouth and or who maketh the dumb or deaf or the seeing or the blind have not I the Lord now therefore go and I will be with thy mouth and teach thee what Thou shalt say amen amen and he said oh my Lord send I pray thee by the hand him whom thou wil send just don't send me he's still bucking against God and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses so God got angry with Moses and he said is not Aaron the levite thy brother I know that he can speak well and also behold he cometh forth to meet thee and when he seeth thee he will be glad in his heart and thou shalt speak unto him and put words in his mouth and I will be with thy mouth and with his mouth and will teach teach you what ye shall do and he shall be thy spokesman unto the people and he shall be even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth and thou shalt be to him instead of God and watch verse 17 and thou shalt take this rod in thy hand wherewith Thou shalt do signs amen all right now Verse 18 um let's just skip down to verse 19 uh Moses in verse 18 ask his father-in-law let us let us go we I I believe what God said I'm going to take Egypt to take over because God said so I'm convinced and concerned amen and so verse 19 it says and the Lord said unto Moses and Midian go return into Egypt for all the men are dead which sought thy life and Moses took his wife and his sons and set them upon an ass and he returned to the land of Egypt and watch and Moses took the rod of God in his hand so now it's not the rod of Moses anymore now is the rod of God amen amen whatever you put into God's hand amen becomes God's amen if you leave it alone and let God use it amen it becomes his amen if you just yield it unto him amen God wanted to express himself through Moses amen through this rod and not necessarily through the rod but it showed that Moses obedience to God's word and that that Rod was the a symbol of Moses's obedience to his word amen and we we see that throughout the the the the plagues and throughout many times God would say you know uh let out the rod or or pull let it out and and and and then flies and things would come about you see amen so God wanted to express his wonders through that Avenue amen amen a a a simple Rod uh that represents human ity that's what God wanted to use amen and that's how God wants to use you you and me in this hour amen something simple something insignificant you might think but in reality you're worth more than 10,000 worlds your soul is that's right and God Amen as I said I've always said before amen God loved you so much amen that he just he loved you so much that he was willing to die this much for you amen stretch forth his hand to Die For You amen you're worth it in his eyes amen praise the Lord and so that Rod amen within itself wasn't anything amen but it just merely represented Moses obedience to God's word amen and it did powerful things amen it did powerful things when you give when Moses gave it over to God Amen now in Psalms chapter 23 David David says here the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want amen I'm so glad that he's our Shepherd amen and when he's our Shepherd amen we're not going to be lacking anything amen amen God has everything that we need amen when we allow him to be our Shepherd and so this is what David is expressing here the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in G Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters amen he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me amen praise God so for the bride of Christ amen his rod amen is for comfort the rod became a a discomfort to the Egyptians Amen in Moses's hand it became a tool of Defense amen where God defends amen the the the sh the Sheep the scattered sheep of Israel amen from their enemies from the Wolves of the the Egyptian wolves that's what God used amen used Moses's Rod to be but for us amen it's to lead and guide us into to comfort Us in this hour amen praise the Lord Jesus thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anoint as my head with oil my cup runneth over as your cup runneth over even in 20123 in rainy November 2023 amen amen is your cup running over are you excited about God just as much as when you when God Amen called your name and say come serve me amen we should be Saints we should be you know sometimes uh sometimes we we get discouraged and sometimes we we wonder Lord why why uh what am I doing do you ever ask yourself that Lord what am I supposed to do uh I feel lost I feel I feel like I'm not uh doing what you I'm supposed to be doing there there's something I've got to do and and and then you start thinking about how God called you and from the beginning amen and how he's LED you even to the point where you are now amen and you're like you realize you went through and and you passed through the areas of your life that you exactly needed to go through in order to be where you are right now God don't want you anywhere else if this is where you are right now right if this is where you are at this moment amen this is where God wanted you amen now I'm not necessarily speaking here in this church I'm just saying in the position that you're in right now right so God is not late God is on untime God praise the Lord Jesus amen surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever praise the Lord Amen brother Brandon says here and and I'm just going a little quickly I promised you guys I wasn't going to keep you long because I wanted to to give a little mission report before I before we head out next week and just kind of give a little update uh of some projects and things that have gone through this year but brother brandham says here what kind of a weapon you going to use he's asking the question you remember remember Pharaoh's got a lot of Chariots and Swordsmen and Horsemen and everything like that he had a crooked stick in his hand speaking of Moses what's in your hand brother Brandon Mass you might not be able to whistle but you can do something man what whatever is in your hand use it to the glory of God whatever is in your hand whatever is at your disposal what you sometimes we feel like we we've got to go to the hospital and raise the dead or or or or or he or pray for all the sick uh or you know do something great but what are you doing with what God's giv you now right what are you doing now with with your family what are you doing now in your position as a mother what are you doing now in the position as a father or or as a husband amen see that's where God wants you at that moment Amen to express him amen praise God and you might feel weak you might feel like like like you're nothing in the midst of of of the bride and and and the people you feel very insignificant but if you have eternal life amen you're just as big amen as the greatest preacher in this message amen amen because he's got the same eternal life that you do and it's not any less it's not anymore amen it's the same God praise the Lord Jesus I know sometimes our young people sometimes they feel that way amen they feel like like like I'm insignificant I'm not I'm not uh what am I you know what am I supposed to do amen but God has a plan for you amen the Bible says seek ye first the kingdom of God Amen when you seek his kingdom amen then God will guide you exactly where you need to be praise the Lord whatever is in your hand use it to the glory of God give it to him and let him bless it just as Moses gave him his Rod amen and let him bless it amen and watch what takes place certainly no matter what it is no matter what it is no matter what your talent is no matter what it is God placed gifts in your life amen ask the Lord and see how can I use this gift for the EMB betterment of the body amen it may seem little and insignificant to you but give it over to God one time amen what little faith you got amen press it in Yonder and put it on the cross of Calvary and believe God's promise for it amen and watch what takes place Amen brother Bram tells the story the little story of of the of the of the little boy who had the the the Loaves and the and the the fish and the the little Loaves and it was the little boy's uh lunch but when Jesus came around and he was going to feed the 5,000 amen he gave his little lunch to the to Jesus amen with the two loaves that he had of bread and or the Five Loaves or the two fishes and that's all he had in his little lunch bag but he just gave it over to Jesus and Jesus multiplied the thing in order to feed 5,000 amen you know I like what what what what the the testimony that brother uh Vernon was telling about the little boy in the Philippines little first grader I don't know if y'all paid attention to that or not that little first grade boy I thought that was striking that all he did was just he was just going to school and he wasn't he wasn't telling people about brother brandom he wasn't telling people about about the message he wasn't telling people about Jesus he was just living out what his parents were living at home and what he was doing was he was he would pray for his meal and it was strange to his teacher and he his teacher looked at him and he said he said son who are your parents and he said M parents are such and such do they go to church yeah we go to church over here such and such and she said well and so she got a touch in touch with his parents and his parents gave him the gave her the address she went to church and and through that amen she got baptized and accepted the message that little boy didn't never tell her not one thing it was just only him praying for his lunch amen amen just little things like that that God uses Amen to save 10,000 worlds amen that was 10,000 worlds right there amen what a powerful testimony how God does things so so peculiar and yet they're his perfect ways amen right so if we're weaklings and God uses us amen our weakness to Express himself we know that Satan amen he's weak because all power has been stripped away from him he has no power in this hour amen he's only a bluff when he talks to you he's only lying when he says you've got such and such a problem you've got cancer you've got diabetes you've got a problem with your heart you've got to have this this that or the other you're family this that or the other your children will never come to the Lord and this that or the other he remember all power has been stripped from him amen praise God and all he is being used is as a tool in God's hand in order to express himself in a mighty way and you watch and see how God's going to how's God's going to perform amen amen all he is is a weakling just like you were a weakling but now amen because you've been born again you have strength through him amen Satan can't be born again like you and me amen he's still weak so he belongs amen man the only thing he wants he can see is the bottom of our shoe that's the only thing that he's supposed to see amen he's supposed to be under your feet and he rises up amen around the little corner or between your toe there and he says you've got cancer you've got diabetes amen you've got this that in your other amen that's right that's where he's supposed to stay amen by your faith in his word right put it to action amen put that thing into action amen and God will take care of the rest because amen he's already a defeated weakling that's right Satan is nothing but a lie amen and he talks to you every day talks to me every day amen yeah three times talk talks to me every as soon as I get up in the morning he's already talking to me so you know what I got to stump him wait you you belong under my shoe just like the roach I killed in the bathroom the other night that's where you belong Satan that's how you got to do it yeah amen that's where he belongs because that's what Jesus did amen he didn't play with Satan right amen right he didn't play his games that's right amen but sometimes that's what we do we we play along and then that's where we get in trouble amen praise the Lord Jesus amen we could take also Gideon amen just real quick and we with this we'll Gideon amen he was a weakling if you read the story of Gideon and in in in in the Book of Judges amen uh uh to me I I I I I like I like that story cuz cuz uh Gideon was just doing what Moses was doing in the desert I'm just doing my own thing I'm living my own life I'm here you know uh doing my farming and and doing and and and and I ain't got time to deal with these enemies around me and the enemies around around him and the kingdom being being taken over and and and and and and here comes the angel of the Lord God himself appears to Gideon and he tells him he said thou mighty man of Valor right he's calling him something that he thinks that he is not Gideon didn't think himself that way but God did he said thou Mighty Man of Valor amen and then so Gideon says wait a second so Lord if it's you then if if it's you and and if you are real then why are all these things happening to us we're supposed to be prospering we're supposed to be your people and he has a discourse there with the angel and he says listen I'm going to use you Gideon I don't care what you think about yourself I have a plan for you amen and so Gideon had to realize amen that through his weakness amen he was able to conquer and be the judge that God called him to be amen and you can read there at the End Amen with but at the end amen he he destroys that I for I forgot I forgot the the the the city or the people that they were supposed to fight uh their name but 300 men that God used amen that Gideon LED Amen in order to defeat over 1500 men amen and all they had was just lanterns in their hands that's they had vessels with with candles in it and they were running down the mountain and Moos and and and Gideon told them shatter those things and and and be and through that it caused chaos in the camp of the enemy and they thought that it was thousands of them getting ready to rush them and it was only 300 of them right and it was only just Earth and vessels Earth and vessels made by man but when God is in the work when God is being you when the word of the Lord is being followed God can make it seem like amen it's a whole host of angels amen a whole host amen Satan can't do nothing against that amen that's right Satan is amen that's what we do when we take the word of God Amen take it by take it uh it promises amen Satan won't be able can't handle that he takes off running and that's where he needs to be Satan you just run right back under my my feet where you belong praise the Lord Jesus how many love the Lord amen amen all right so uh I left my phone in here I'm sorry excuse me I was going to connect it um as you all know we're getting ready to leave next Friday to our trip to Honduras and so we would covet your prayers amen

there's brother Robert was provided by by by the church so right here is where they're going to have the little Pastor study right here where where they're taking down those columns that's where they're going to have that little study that they want they were wanting to have because the study has always been in the inside the pastor's house this is the pastor's house where they're at the front porch here and so they would I've preach there personally and so you go in there and that's where you come you come out of his house that's the study to go go to the pulpit to to to to preach so they wanted to have a little an actual Pastor study um and so that's what they're building right there um and so they told me that they were going to make more uh give me more updates on that and so I just wanted to share that with you all also um this wasn't something by the done by the church but it was uh provided by the funds um and at brother Joe Green's camp in North Carolina this past not this La this one this last August but the August of last year and we were able to I made a request for for this and it was about $4,500 and this was a church that we were able to build and help build there in Honduras that they were needing and uh this is a a little quick video of of of the church this is Brother natividad uh natividad um I think his last name is Vela and that's the little church

about his ears if know he was born with closed um ears or his ear hole ear canal and U they went for the test a couple of weeks to see because they were thinking that he was he actually had problem things but those tests at this doctor's visit they those tests came out good he doesn't have issues with his actual eardrums and stuff it's just that the the ear canal is is closed and so that's the reason why he's not able to hear that that that good so they put this device on him uh where it's picking up so it's temporarily it's temporarily for him it's temporarily for him to be able to uh to hear and so but he he pray for them because they they still need to have the surgery to open up up his ear canals a little bit more and so uh but God is at work God answered prayer about this because
