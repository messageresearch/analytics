[0:01] God bless you Saints good to be in the
[0:03] house of the Lord this morning good to
[0:05] be back
[0:08] home let's see if we
[0:19] can there we go all right we've been
[0:23] studying on Hebrews chapter 6 let's just
[0:25] go to the Lord in prayer Lord we're so
[0:27] grateful to be able to gather together
[0:28] around your word once more and we come
[0:30] expecting this morning and we just ask
[0:32] Lord that you'll just bless the services
[0:33] today and Lord as we meditate upon your
[0:36] word Lord we begin to think upon things
[0:38] Lord to get our heart and our mind set
[0:40] Lord to receive your word today granted
[0:43] Lord that you'll just bless us today in
[0:44] your name
[0:46] amen so Hebrews Hebrews chapter 6 what
[0:50] kind of the theme of of some of the
[0:51] things that um Paul is is talking about
[0:54] in in that chapter just kind of wanted
[0:55] to summarize before we continue on and
[0:58] he says in in verse verse 7 for the
[1:00] Earth which drinketh in the rain that
[1:02] cometh off upon it and bringeth forth
[1:04] herbs meat for them by whom it is
[1:05] dressed receiveth blessing from God but
[1:08] that which beareth thorns and briers is
[1:10] rejected and is nigh and cursing whose
[1:11] end is to be burned so the rain falls on
[1:14] the just and the unjust but if it can
[1:16] fall on that good ground it's going to
[1:18] bring up up something it's going to it's
[1:20] going to Quicken the word and in verse
[1:22] 15 he says and so after he had patiently
[1:24] endured he obtained the promise talking
[1:26] about Abraham he obtained the promise
[1:30] and verse 19 he says which hope we have
[1:32] is an anchor of the Soul we've got that
[1:34] that that promise that Abraham was
[1:36] looking for typed something that uh
[1:38] would happen in the New Testament the
[1:40] promise of the Holy Ghost of that seed
[1:42] that promise seed and that's what
[1:44] anchors our soul which hope we have as
[1:46] an anchor of the Soul both sure and
[1:47] steadfast and which entereth into that
[1:49] within the veil so if we go if we start
[1:53] reading through at verse n he says but
[1:54] beloved we are persuaded better things
[1:57] of you and things that accompany
[1:59] salvation though we thus speak for God
[2:01] is Not unrighteous to forget your work
[2:03] and labor of love which you have showed
[2:05] toward his name and that you have
[2:07] ministered to the Saints and New
[2:09] Minister and we desire that every one of
[2:11] you do show the same diligence to the
[2:14] full Assurance of Hope un the end that
[2:16] you be not slothful but followers of
[2:19] them who through faith and patience
[2:20] inherit the promises so again he's
[2:23] talking about promises that we have
[2:25] access to and to not not be slothful but
[2:28] but to be diligent to to to uh do
[2:30] everything we
[2:32] can to further to to to see this promise
[2:36] manifested in our life and so as he as
[2:38] he keeps reading on he says in verse 13
[2:41] for when God made promise to Abraham
[2:44] he's talking about a promise here
[2:46] because he can swear by no greater he
[2:48] swear by himself so now let's think
[2:51] about that promise the promise promise
[2:52] that he gave to Abraham was to see a
[2:54] child born and to see a birth and so the
[2:58] promise that we're looking at that for
[3:00] this in this day is to is to see the
[3:02] birth of the word in our lives and to
[3:05] not just not just a new birth but uh to
[3:07] be born again according to Malachi 456
[3:10] to have the word B born in us to bring
[3:12] us to a place where we can see the son
[3:14] of man man manifest in our lives saying
[3:17] surely blessing I Will Bless thee and
[3:19] multiplying I will multiply thee and so
[3:22] after he had patiently endured after he
[3:26] had patiently endured now to keep in
[3:28] mind all of the things that Paul has
[3:30] talked about in Hebrews the children of
[3:31] Israel coming through the Wilderness and
[3:32] all the trials that they've endured and
[3:34] all the thing to to see they they want
[3:37] uh striving to see that promise made
[3:39] manifest to end up in the promised land
[3:42] and so after he had patiently endured he
[3:44] obtained the
[3:46] promise so Paul say Paul's saying in
[3:49] verse 13 because he could swear by no
[3:52] greater he swear by himself and we've
[3:55] got in verse uh the little way down
[3:57] there at the bottom you maybe you can't
[3:59] see it uh but in in in Genesis
[4:02] 22:16 it says and said by myself have I
[4:06] sworn sayith the Lord for because thou
[4:08] Hast done this thing and has not
[4:10] withheld thy son thine only son now
[4:12] let's let's think about that promise
[4:14] that he gave a promise by myself I have
[4:16] have I sworn and in thy seed shall all
[4:19] the nations of the earth be blessed
[4:21] because thou obeyed my voice so now he's
[4:25] making a promise that's got something to
[4:27] do with that seed we know the seed is
[4:29] typing the seed the seed is typing not
[4:32] just Abraham's progeny but the seed is
[4:34] really typing is speaking of the of
[4:36] Christ that will come Christ is the seed
[4:39] so now when when God makes a promise
[4:42] it's something when we read the Bible we
[4:44] can have we it's something you can lay
[4:45] hold to he's he's not just saying vain
[4:48] words I I I I I've been thinking
[4:50] meditating a lot lately that how when
[4:52] you when when God's word Goes Forth it
[4:54] is going to accomplish his purpose right
[4:57] it's not just going to fall fall to the
[4:59] ground but it's going to do something
[5:00] God is going to have a bride so when God
[5:03] says something in his word it's going to
[5:05] come to pass and and Paul Paul that's
[5:08] what he's stressing here in in chapter
[5:10] six that that that God's word is so
[5:13] immutable immutable means it it cannot
[5:15] be changed it's something that you can
[5:18] have confidence in like I've got this
[5:20] the picture of this rock
[5:22] here a rock now uh that no matter how
[5:25] much the the winds and the waves crash
[5:28] against it it's it's going understand
[5:30] the test of time it's going to be there
[5:32] forever and ever like like brother
[5:34] brownman that sermon we just listened to
[5:36] the Hebrews 138 he's the same yesterday
[5:39] today and forever that's the kind of
[5:40] immutable rock that we have our
[5:42] confidence in so in verse 16 Paul says
[5:45] for men verily swear by the greater and
[5:48] an oath for confirmation is to them an
[5:50] end of all Strife wherein God willing
[5:53] more abundantly to show unto The Heirs
[5:55] of Promise the immutability of his
[5:57] counsel confirmed it by an oath he
[6:00] wanted to show the immutability of his
[6:02] counsel in other words how How firm that
[6:06] the things that he says are how he he
[6:09] wanted us to have such a confidence in
[6:10] it that not just not only did he say it
[6:13] but he swore an oath to to double
[6:16] confirm it that by two immutable things
[6:20] in which if it was if it was impossible
[6:22] for God to lie we might have a strong
[6:24] consolation who have fled for Refuge to
[6:27] lay upon the Hope set before us so again
[6:30] I've got that scripture over there by
[6:31] myself have I sworn that in blessing I
[6:33] Will Bless thee and in multiplying I
[6:35] will multiply thy seed as the stars of
[6:38] the heavens see now he's talking about a
[6:40] promise to the seed which is Christ that
[6:43] he would multiply by the thy seed as the
[6:46] stars of the heaven that's talking about
[6:48] you and I sitting here this morning in
[6:50] other words that's that promise that he
[6:52] gave the immutable promise that he swore
[6:54] an oath on top of is the baptism of the
[6:56] Holy Ghost as the sand which is upon on
[6:59] the seashore and thy seed shall possess
[7:02] the Gate of his enemies now see see this
[7:05] is something that'll preach
[7:08] when am we've got a confidence we've got
[7:11] a promise that's so firm that God wanted
[7:14] us to lay claim to that no matter what
[7:16] kind of gates in front of you no matter
[7:18] what kind of mountains in front of you
[7:20] you got a promise that you can lay claim
[7:22] to that thy seed shall possess the Gate
[7:25] of his
[7:26] enemies so we've got two immutable
[7:29] things that we can we can look look to
[7:31] in in the word so brother Amma said we
[7:33] have two things yes first his word said
[7:36] he would do it yes now that should be
[7:38] enough that when God said something that
[7:41] that should be enough but the second was
[7:44] the sworn his sworn oath on it that he
[7:46] would do it I swore an oath onto it now
[7:49] see the two immutable things are that
[7:51] God cannot lie God can't lie we can we
[7:55] can we can say things just in our
[7:57] Humanity like I was saying in past Su
[7:59] school lessons that you know I'm going
[8:00] to be over at your house after church
[8:02] I'm going to do I'm going to meet you
[8:03] somewhere and then a bad storm comes up
[8:06] and we just we just for some reason or
[8:07] another we even if we're not lying just
[8:10] we can't we we might not be able to do
[8:12] it but the God is not that way it
[8:14] doesn't matter what storms come come up
[8:16] it doesn't matter what mountains in
[8:18] front of you it doesn't matter what the
[8:20] enemy throws in front of you but his
[8:22] word says he would do
[8:24] it and he put on top of that the second
[8:27] was his sworn oath on it see brother
[8:30] Adam said to know this that God has
[8:32] promised us by a sworn oath one that he
[8:35] cannot lie the other he swore an oath on
[8:38] top of that what that he will raise us
[8:41] see how everything's bottled up in the
[8:43] Holy Ghost everything's if you've got
[8:46] the Holy Ghost you've got access to all
[8:48] of these promises that he's confirming
[8:51] by an oath on top of his word that he
[8:53] said he would do it that he will raise
[8:55] us up at the last day and give us
[8:57] eternal life that's that promise to the
[9:00] seed the promise is the seed of of
[9:04] Christ so brother R said and he swore by
[9:07] himself he said God made an oath
[9:09] promised Abraham and swore by himself
[9:12] that I'll save you and your seed after
[9:14] you what is the Seed of Abraham now see
[9:17] what the oath is that that that he he
[9:19] made to Abraham what is the Seed of
[9:22] Abraham now who is the one that's got
[9:24] this Sure hold who is the one that's
[9:26] built on this foundation not just every
[9:28] time Dick and Harry not all that saith
[9:31] to me Lord Lord will enter in but the
[9:32] one that doeth the will of My Father
[9:34] which is in heaven and this is the
[9:36] Father's will this is his word so he's
[9:39] I've got this little picture of the of
[9:41] the hand with all these all these these
[9:43] these people that God was thinking about
[9:46] because that's what the promise is the
[9:48] promise is to you and I that have been
[9:49] born by the holy ghost that that you'll
[9:52] possess the Gate of every enemy that no
[9:54] matter what the devil throws in you that
[9:56] God has given you power to
[9:58] overcome
[10:00] so I think I've got the in the yellow
[10:02] there that that that scripture that in
[10:04] blessing I will P thee and in
[10:06] multiplying I will multiply thy seed as
[10:08] the stars of the heaven and as the sand
[10:10] which is upon the seashore and thy seed
[10:12] shall possess the Gate of his enemies
[10:15] and so brother man would say in Jesus
[10:17] Christ the same yesterday and day today
[10:18] and forever he said father God he was
[10:21] praying in prayer it is most solemnly
[10:23] that we come to thee you have declared
[10:25] yourself you're not guilty of your
[10:27] promise anymore
[10:30] how is he not guilty of his promise
[10:32] because he sent the baptism of the Holy
[10:33] Ghost he sent the proof of of of the
[10:36] things that he was he was promising to
[10:38] Abraham he's he's Vindicated his word he
[10:42] said you made it true for the Bible said
[10:44] that God cannot lie the immutable things
[10:47] God cannot lie and God swore that he
[10:49] would do it if we could only believe it
[10:52] then we see Jesus said this morning in
[10:54] the reading that it's it's impossible
[10:56] the scriptures cannot be broken so when
[10:59] God says something it's something that
[11:00] you can hang everything on you can hang
[11:02] your soul on you can have total
[11:04] confidence that God the only thing
[11:06] that's preventing God's word from coming
[11:08] to pass is for us to just believe
[11:10] it and brother R in Hebrews chapter 6
[11:14] number two he said notice God made a
[11:16] promise to Abraham
[11:18] unconditional and now wait Abraham did
[11:20] not have to do one
[11:22] thing the only thing you got to do this
[11:25] morning is just believe God's word you
[11:28] don't have to work one thing up you
[11:29] don't have to grab somebody by the head
[11:31] and shake them until they speak in
[11:33] tongues you don't have to force
[11:34] something to happen see this morning
[11:37] while we we're preaching the gospel we
[11:39] we're not trying to force anybody to do
[11:41] anything we're not you don't have to
[11:43] work anything up just sit there and just
[11:45] accept the word and believe it in your
[11:46] heart he said God said I've already done
[11:48] it so he's already done it God made a
[11:51] promise to ABRA to Adam said Adam if
[11:54] you'll not touch this you'll live
[11:55] forever but the day you eat thereof that
[11:57] day you die Adam said I just wonder what
[11:58] it's all all about anyhow he goes over
[12:01] and eats it tampered every time that God
[12:03] made a man a man makes his Covenant with
[12:05] God or God with a man the man breaks his
[12:07] part so God had to do something because
[12:09] he seen what man was and they were
[12:11] foreordained they were elected and God
[12:13] had to do something so God came down and
[12:16] made his Covenant with a Abraham
[12:20] unconditionally if it wouldn't have been
[12:22] unconditionally Abraham would have been
[12:23] lost a long time what's what's brother
[12:26] Ram talking about in Hebrews chapter 6
[12:27] he's talking about UNC conditional
[12:29] Covenant when God gives you the baptism
[12:30] of the Holy Ghost because you believed
[12:32] it not because you worked something up
[12:36] because you just believed it then God's
[12:38] going to do it he's going to take care
[12:40] of everything if you just believe him
[12:42] that's all you got to
[12:45] do in Hebrews chapter 6 number two
[12:47] brother said if we are dead in Christ we
[12:49] are Abraham's seed and are ears
[12:52] according to the
[12:53] promise that's what the Bible said would
[12:55] you like to read it while the Bible said
[12:57] that the promise was not only to Abraham
[13:00] and his seeds like you Abraham had many
[13:03] seeds sure many children Ishmael was his
[13:05] child he had seven or eight children
[13:07] after Sarah died by another one Cura but
[13:09] look the seed was the promised one which
[13:12] was Isaac and through Isaac came Christ
[13:15] through Christ came us the promise is
[13:18] unconditionally amen now what about
[13:20] Abraham why he' have been done it' been
[13:22] impossible for him to ever get back
[13:24] again sure it had been impossible for
[13:26] Saul to ever get back again if that if
[13:28] you you'd have to read the scriptures
[13:30] that way see but it wasn't God's promise
[13:33] endures forever yes now that's that
[13:35] immutable promise that God confirmed by
[13:38] an oath where he said it and he
[13:40] confirmed it by an oath and he swore it
[13:43] that he was going to send his he was
[13:44] going to send the promise of the Holy
[13:45] Ghost and if you would receive it by
[13:48] believing not trying to work something
[13:49] up but God would accomplish every he
[13:52] would fulfill all of his promise by that
[13:54] Holy Ghost listen what brother Ram said
[13:57] he said God never gives Sarah the
[13:59] promise he gave Abraham the promise but
[14:01] Sarah was included he made the promise
[14:03] in Christ Jesus and I was included in
[14:05] him you were too through Isaac come
[14:08] Christ that was Abraham's seed is Christ
[14:10] and then the Seed of Abraham first
[14:12] wasn't through sexual seed it was his
[14:14] faith that God reckoned and it's through
[14:16] faith in us to believe the death burial
[14:18] and the resurrection of Christ brings us
[14:21] Abraham's seed for it was Abraham the
[14:23] promise was made and only Abraham was
[14:25] the promise made to him and his seed
[14:28] Abraham and to his seed and his seed was
[14:30] not all of his children but in Isaac was
[14:32] his seed called and here is the results
[14:34] here is the results of Abraham's seed
[14:37] Jesus Christ is Abraham's seed and we
[14:39] being dead in Christ take on Abraham's
[14:41] seed and are HS according to the promise
[14:45] let's not forget the context that we're
[14:46] talking about we're talking about
[14:48] Hebrews 6 chter 8 verse 18 that by two
[14:51] immutable things in which it was
[14:54] impossible for God to lie we might have
[14:56] a strong consolation so this morning I
[14:59] think we should have a strong
[15:00] consolation that we got two immutable
[15:03] things that God gave us that we should
[15:05] have a strong consolation who have fled
[15:07] for Refuge to lay hold upon the Hope set
[15:09] before us this hope that's set before us
[15:12] we've got something God has given un us
[15:15] something brother R said in melkisedek
[15:17] the great Prince and King he said what a
[15:19] marvelous promise two immutable things
[15:21] God cannot lie and be God Amen now if
[15:25] God has made a promise in his Bible here
[15:27] we believe the Bible to be the
[15:28] infallible word of God and if God has
[15:31] made a promise in this Bible we have
[15:33] this consolation and know that it's
[15:35] impossible for God to lie now you think
[15:38] about this morning whatever things you
[15:39] have need of as the word's going forth
[15:41] it's impossible for God to
[15:43] lie therefore when he sees he promised
[15:46] it in the Bible We Believe It soul body
[15:49] and spirit can you say that this morning
[15:51] you believe it soul body and spirit it's
[15:53] impossible for him to
[15:57] lie
[15:59] so let's see what that means
[16:01] now brother Ram said in Hebrews chapter
[16:04] 6 number three he said knowing that so
[16:07] if you got the Holy Ghost now if you got
[16:08] that promised
[16:11] seed knowing that after we have been
[16:15] called that he said that he knew us
[16:17] before the foundation of the world and
[16:19] predestinated US unto adoption of
[16:21] children through Jesus Christ and he
[16:23] forne us he called us and when he called
[16:25] us he justified us what what's brother
[16:28] ra to do he's trying to build up your
[16:29] confidence to know if God's got you if
[16:32] you're in him he's got
[16:36] you and when he called us he justified
[16:38] us we cannot justify ourselves it's not
[16:40] by our own works that's right so he
[16:42] justified Us by the death of his own son
[16:45] those who he has Justified he is already
[16:48] glorified the word is already spoke yes
[16:53] and we're just on our road going along
[16:55] rejoicing on our way to
[16:57] Glory like in Romans 8:30 moreover whom
[17:01] he did
[17:02] predestinate them he also called and
[17:05] whom he called them he also Justified
[17:07] see now if he's filled you with the Holy
[17:09] Ghost and he's Justified you in your
[17:11] soul whom he justified then he also
[17:14] glorified he in other words he's got you
[17:17] and you're part of that promise that
[17:20] that goes back to Genesis 22 and in thy
[17:22] seed shall all the nations of the earth
[17:24] be blessed because thou Hast obeyed my
[17:27] voice you're part of that promise now
[17:30] see you you're part of that
[17:31] unconditional Covenant that if youve got
[17:33] the baptism of Holy Ghost he's got he's
[17:35] got you he said now brother BR would say
[17:37] in Hebrews chapter 6 number two he said
[17:39] you say well can't we backslide
[17:41] absolutely and when you backslide you're
[17:44] going to get it don't you
[17:46] worry backsliding is when you you you
[17:49] forget what your purpose is you forget
[17:51] you forget you're supposed to be in
[17:52] church you forget you you start sliding
[17:54] back and you just get you get let the
[17:56] world start taking a hold he said when
[17:58] you backslide you're going to get it
[18:00] don't you worry Abraham got it and the
[18:02] rest of them got it and you'll get it
[18:04] don't you think it gives you a right to
[18:05] sin it doesn't you'll pay for everything
[18:08] that you do you'll reap what you seow
[18:09] you do one little sin and you reap a
[18:11] whole Wash Tub full that's right
[18:15] but but brother that don't mean to say
[18:19] that you're lost
[18:21] Hallelujah that's exactly right Abraham
[18:24] reaped exactly what he SED that's right
[18:26] but he was still saved
[18:29] the Covenant that now see that that's
[18:31] what we read just just a minute ago in
[18:33] Romans 8:30 whom he predestinated he
[18:35] called and who he called he justified
[18:37] and who he justified he's also
[18:41] glorified the Covenant that God made
[18:43] with Israel they lost their inheritage
[18:45] they lost the promised land and went
[18:47] down into Egypt but they hadn't lost
[18:48] their Covenant God said I remember my
[18:52] promise to Abraham I remember and I've
[18:55] come down to deliver my people go down
[18:57] there most Moes and tell Pharaoh I said
[18:59] let my people go I remember I made a
[19:03] promise to Abraham and to his
[19:06] seed now brother R when he's laying out
[19:09] all this promise he he would talk about
[19:10] how that that uh you remember when when
[19:13] when God put Abraham into a deep sleep
[19:15] he he he he made all those sacrifices
[19:18] where he killed the Bulls and and
[19:20] whatnot all the animals and he separated
[19:21] them and brother R would say you know
[19:23] when you when you make a PR when you
[19:25] make a covenant in the Old Testament
[19:27] that's how how they would do they would
[19:29] they would take an animal and they would
[19:30] divide it to to symbolize that Covenant
[19:33] and so that was fulfilled on the cross
[19:35] as Jesus his his he pulled his his soul
[19:39] and his body was divided as a covenant
[19:41] to us that he had fulf he was going to
[19:43] fulfill that promise the promise what to
[19:45] give to send that seed this the promise
[19:48] of the Holy Ghost so brother Bram and
[19:50] melkisedek the great Prince and King he
[19:52] said and God swore to Abraham that he
[19:54] would keep this Covenant with him and
[19:56] with his seed forever God swore wor by
[19:58] himself that he would do it and in doing
[20:01] so under the Old Law when you made an
[20:02] oath under the Old Law you killed an
[20:04] animal cut it in two and then the two
[20:07] men on which the oath was taken by stood
[20:09] between the animal and they wrote out on
[20:10] a piece of paper a certain contract and
[20:13] that piece of paper was torn apart and
[20:15] given to one and the other man and they
[20:17] took a oath over this dead animal that
[20:19] if they broke that Covenant between them
[20:20] let them be as this dead animal so God
[20:23] having no other to swear by see this is
[20:26] tiing in don't forget what we're talking
[20:28] talking about we're talking about
[20:29] Hebrews chapter 6 where God willing more
[20:32] abundantly to show under the HS of
[20:34] Promise the immutability of his counsil
[20:36] confirmed it by an oath and see in the
[20:38] Old Testament they would confirm an oath
[20:40] by tearing two tearing two animals apart
[20:42] but here in the New Testament how he
[20:44] confirm it by dying on the cross he said
[20:46] that having no other to swear by he
[20:49] swore by himself and he took the oath
[20:50] over the body of the Lord Jesus Christ
[20:52] foreseeing it in a shadow and in the
[20:54] Covenant when he took Christ to Calvary
[20:56] he tore his body and soul apart and he
[20:59] lifted up his body to sit on his right
[21:01] hand and S back sent back the Holy
[21:03] Spirit to be in the Christian to do the
[21:05] same thing here in the church that he
[21:07] did in Christ so he sent his holy spirit
[21:10] into the church to prove to prove his
[21:12] word to prove his promise to you that's
[21:14] why you there EV the evidence that God
[21:16] loves you is that he sent his holy
[21:18] spirit into you to prove his word that
[21:21] by two immutable things in which it was
[21:23] impossible for God to lie we might have
[21:26] a strong consolation who have fled for
[21:29] Refuge to lay upon the Hope set before
[21:31] us said brother would say in Jesus
[21:33] Christ the same yesterday today and
[21:35] forever he said father God it is most
[21:36] solemnly that we come to thee you have
[21:39] declared yourself and I'm I'm reading
[21:40] that same quote again you're not guilty
[21:42] of your promise anymore you made it true
[21:45] for the Bible said that God cannot lie
[21:47] the immutable things God cannot lie and
[21:51] God swore that he would do it if we
[21:53] could only believe
[21:56] it which hope we have in verse 19 that's
[22:00] the Hope we've got the baptism of the
[22:02] Holy Ghost that God sent into his church
[22:05] we hope which hope we have as an anchor
[22:07] of the Soul that's your anchor and when
[22:11] you're filled with the Holy Ghost there
[22:12] ain't nothing going to ever take that
[22:14] away from you both sure and steadfast
[22:17] and which entereth into that within the
[22:20] veil that's the anchor that anchor that
[22:23] anchors your whole life it'll anchor
[22:24] your family it anchors your decisions it
[22:26] changes it changes everything when
[22:28] you're filled with the Holy Ghost
[22:30] whether the Forerunner is for us entered
[22:32] whether the Forerunner is for us entered
[22:34] even Jesus made an high priest Forever
[22:37] After the order of melkisedek so now
[22:39] Paul's Paul's he's making his way over
[22:41] to Hebrews chapter 7 where he's going to
[22:43] start laying out what who melkisedek was
[22:46] and and what why that's important to
[22:53] us I'm going skip over that slide and
[22:56] brother said talking about a forerunner
[22:59] he said no wonder you can look death in
[23:00] the face and say where is your steam
[23:03] grave where is your Victory because
[23:05] we're in the Forerunner a
[23:08] forerunner did you ever notice in the
[23:10] old western days many times we went
[23:12] across the old Trails a forerunner or
[23:14] Scout when the raag Wagon Train was
[23:16] perishing for water the Scout run ahead
[23:19] and he seen the tribes of Indians he
[23:21] bypassed them and he seen where there
[23:23] was a fountain of water he rushed back
[23:24] to tell the boss of the Wagon Train Step
[23:27] Up the horses everybody take good
[23:30] courage for just over the mountain
[23:32] there's a big Fountain of water he's a
[23:35] forerunner and here the Forerunner man
[23:37] was once pinned down by the devil under
[23:40] rapid fire but somebody took the Machine
[23:42] Gun Nest that was Jesus the Forerunner
[23:46] has gone before us and Satan standing
[23:49] there with a machine gun pinning us down
[23:51] always in bondage and scared of death he
[23:54] was guarding that Fountain sure he was
[23:55] he was given the commission because we
[23:58] had sinned and been driven drove away
[24:00] from it but the Forerunner Christ come
[24:02] in and took the nest now see that the
[24:05] Forerunner Forerunner somebody to go
[24:07] ahead of you and and clear the way and
[24:10] let you know what's ahead now you think
[24:13] let's meditate on this for a second now
[24:15] the Forerunner is somebody that goes
[24:17] through all of the things for you so you
[24:19] can look back in this case you can look
[24:21] back at the life of Jesus Christ and
[24:23] look and see everything that you're
[24:24] going to have to go through as a
[24:25] Christian let's examine that for a
[24:27] second now look he was born in a major
[24:30] he was born down in a in in a like a
[24:33] little dirty a dirty spot you know just
[24:36] next to the cows and next to the donkeys
[24:38] and things just like how the word was
[24:42] born in your dirty filthy life and and
[24:45] God God came and and and and and and
[24:48] birthed the word in that little manger
[24:52] now you keep following through all all
[24:54] the all the significant points of
[24:56] Jesus's life as the Forerunner
[24:58] he lived a life that you're also going
[25:00] to have to live he went down and he was
[25:02] baptized by John well you got to be
[25:04] baptized you got to be baptized repent
[25:06] and be baptized in the name of the Lord
[25:08] Jesus Christ and then there on that
[25:10] River Jordan he he he fulfilled you know
[25:13] in a type of of of you've got to be
[25:15] filled with the Holy Ghost and he kept
[25:17] he kept walking through his life and he
[25:19] came to the place where finally he was
[25:21] he was adopted and on that mount of
[25:23] transfiguration uh he went through the
[25:26] process of hear ye him where God looked
[25:28] down at him and said now now this this
[25:31] person has come to a place where I trust
[25:33] everything that he says now you see all
[25:34] these things as a forerunner he's going
[25:36] through going through the process the
[25:38] same process that you and I have to go
[25:41] through he there there in that Garden of
[25:43] gsim and he ding out to himself father
[25:45] not my will but thine be done that you
[25:47] and I have to come to that place as well
[25:48] where we're totally trusting and and
[25:52] totally die die out to ourself and he
[25:54] went down into the grave just like a lot
[25:56] of a lot of Christians have have to go
[25:58] will have to go out down into the grave
[25:59] but then he rose up on Easter morning
[26:02] and his body was changed now you see he
[26:04] went through a as a forerunner he went
[26:06] through every proc every step in his
[26:08] life that a Christian is going to go
[26:11] through the
[26:12] Forerunner and we're going to close on
[26:14] this as a musician can go ahead and come
[26:16] forward the Forerunner the man that went
[26:17] before us as one come and took our place
[26:20] none other but God himself he come down
[26:22] and made himself a man for a forun to
[26:25] prove to the people why he swore by an o
[26:27] that he was going to do it he swore he
[26:30] was going to save us he swore that we
[26:32] could do it he swore these things to us
[26:34] by himself then he come down and was
[26:36] made a forerunner he made himself a
[26:39] forerunner he entered here on the world
[26:41] and lived in the world sin all around
[26:43] him and above above sin because he
[26:46] trusted
[26:47] God Amen God bless
[26:52] [Applause]
[26:56] you
