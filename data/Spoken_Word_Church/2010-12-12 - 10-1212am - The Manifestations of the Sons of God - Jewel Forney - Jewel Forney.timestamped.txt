[37:01] Hey, as you got your Bibles this
[37:03] morning,
[37:04] let's go to Romans 8. A familiar
[37:07] scripture without it been read over and
[37:10] over and over, but let's just look at it
[37:11] again.
[37:12] Amen.
[37:13] Romans 8,
[37:16] Romans the 8th chapter. And I'm going to
[37:18] begin reading at the 19th verse.
[37:24] And it says, "For the earnest
[37:26] expectation of the creature waited for
[37:30] the manifestations of the sons of God."
[37:32] That's right.
[37:33] For the creature was made subject to
[37:35] vanity, not willingly, but by the reason
[37:37] of him who had subject the same in hope.
[37:41] Because
[37:42] the creature itself also shall be
[37:45] delivered from the bondage of corruption
[37:47] into the glorious liberty of the
[37:50] childrens of God.
[37:51] That's right. For we know that the whole
[37:53] creation groanth and prevailed in pain
[37:56] together until now.
[37:58] Not only they but ourself also which
[38:01] have the first fruit of the spirit even
[38:03] we ourself grown within ourselves
[38:06] waiting
[38:07] for the adoption to w the redemption of
[38:12] our bodies. Glory
[38:13] let's pray.
[38:16] Lord, I just trust you one more time to
[38:18] help me to yield my body, my mind to
[38:21] you, God.
[38:23] Help me, Lord Jesus, just to step aside.
[38:26] God, use it for your glory this morning.
[38:30] Take full control of the service, know
[38:32] brother Sam, brother Wade, and the other
[38:34] brother that went, Lord, on these trips,
[38:36] God, strengthen all their bodies.
[38:38] Strengthen everyone that made an effort
[38:40] to be here this morning. We ask it in
[38:42] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[38:45] Amen. You may be seated in one moment.
[38:47] Thank the Lord for the reading of the
[38:49] word of God this morning.
[38:50] That's right.
[38:52] And we uh took from the scripture.
[38:56] It says, "For the earnest expectation
[38:59] of the creature waited for the
[39:02] manifestations of the sons of God."
[39:05] Glory.
[39:06] And I want to talk on the manifestation
[39:08] of the sons of God this morning.
[39:10] Amen. And we begin to look here, we find
[39:12] here that when we begin to think on
[39:15] manifestation,
[39:17] we begin to think on what in other word
[39:19] the whole creation,
[39:21] the world is falling apart.
[39:24] Your tribulation is hitting the world. I
[39:27] politics is falling apart
[39:29] and everything is waiting
[39:31] for you to find your place so rapture
[39:34] can take place.
[39:35] So I begin to think, I begin to think on
[39:38] a manifestation.
[39:40] And when we think of manifestation and
[39:42] the the majority of time we we think
[39:45] about the manifestation of power.
[39:47] Yeah.
[39:49] And that is what positionally place us
[39:51] as at as the idea of of of the thought
[39:54] today. If I see power then I'm
[39:56] positionally positionally placed.
[39:59] But when Jesus talked on a manifestation
[40:02] in St. Matthew 10, he gave them power.
[40:05] Right. Right. And they cast out devils
[40:08] and they healed the sick. They're not
[40:10] done signs and wonders. And then Jesus
[40:13] turned around and said, "Don't you
[40:15] rejoice over this."
[40:17] Right?
[40:18] He told him about the day and he gave
[40:20] him a manifestation of power. He told
[40:23] him not to rejoice over this,
[40:26] but rejoice because your name is written
[40:28] in heaven.
[40:29] So now he took this manifestation a lot
[40:33] higher than just catching our devils.
[40:36] Exactly. That's right.
[40:38] A manifestation of power. St. Matthew
[40:40] 10. So we find in St. John 1 and verse
[40:44] 12, he said it again. As many have
[40:48] received him
[40:50] to them he gave power
[40:53] to become the son of God.
[40:57] Now ask yourself a question. Which is
[40:59] the most powerful manifestation?
[41:01] Right.
[41:02] Casting out devils or becoming the son
[41:04] of God? Amen.
[41:05] Hallelujah. Boom was a what? Boom was a
[41:08] release of power.
[41:10] Boom was a release of of a manifestation
[41:13] of power. But one casting that devil and
[41:15] the other one become a son of God.
[41:18] So we find here that the manifestation
[41:20] to become a son of God is greater than
[41:23] the manifestation to casting that devil.
[41:25] So we begin to look here and I begin to
[41:27] go here. But Jesus broke it down in his
[41:30] own way of putting this manifestation.
[41:32] How do he speak on it? Yeah.
[41:34] If I turn to St. John 14, man, look at
[41:38] that one real quick.
[41:42] St. John the 14th chapter.
[41:48] St. John the 14th chapter. They just see
[41:50] how Jesus himself talked on this this
[41:54] manifestation of the son of God.
[41:57] Right?
[41:58] St. John 14. Let me begin reading at
[42:01] verse 15. You can follow along here. And
[42:04] he said, "If you love me, do what?
[42:08] Keep my commandments."
[42:10] Right?
[42:11] And I will pray the father and he shall
[42:13] give you another comforter that he may
[42:16] abide with you. Now, when you go to your
[42:19] wherever you're going in the valley, you
[42:20] feel like you're all alone. How do God
[42:22] don't leave you there in when you when
[42:25] when you lost a loved one or something
[42:28] go wrong in life, God don't leave you
[42:30] in? He shall abide with you forever.
[42:33] Exactly.
[42:34] In other words, I will not leave you
[42:36] without a father. I will not leave you
[42:39] without a mother. I will not leave you
[42:41] without a best friend. I will not leave
[42:43] you without a doctor. I will not leave
[42:45] you without a savior. I will not leave
[42:48] you without a healer. I will be with you
[42:51] forever.
[42:51] Amen. Thank you. Right, brother.
[42:54] He said, even the spirit of truth
[42:56] whom the world cannot receive. That's
[43:00] right.
[43:00] Because it seeth him not,
[43:03] neither know of him,
[43:05] but yay know him.
[43:08] Amen.
[43:10] For he dwelleth with you,
[43:13] and shall be in you.
[43:15] Amen.
[43:16] I will not leave you comfort,
[43:19] right?
[43:19] And a child without a father. I will
[43:23] come to to you
[43:25] right
[43:26] a little while and the world see me no
[43:29] more
[43:29] right
[43:31] but you ain't see me
[43:33] because I live you live also
[43:36] right
[43:37] and he he breaks it down right here
[43:40] and where he makes it clear what his
[43:43] mental station what he's looking for
[43:45] right right
[43:46] he says at that day
[43:51] yeah shall No, I am in my blood.
[43:55] Right.
[43:55] Hallelujah. We're going to say first
[43:58] poor.
[43:58] Right.
[43:59] And then he said
[44:02] and yay
[44:03] in me.
[44:05] Second Paul
[44:06] and I in you.
[44:09] Third.
[44:10] Hallelujah. I ain't got to worry. It's
[44:12] all right to know that the father was in
[44:15] that Jesus Christ had the father in him
[44:17] with the revelation. But what about you?
[44:20] That's right. Hallelujah. So he read the
[44:23] word. He did not leave you with a second
[44:26] hand revelation.
[44:27] Amen.
[44:27] Hallelujah. He want to make sure that
[44:30] you understood that God is manifested in
[44:33] you.
[44:35] So Paul, he goes and picks it up in the
[44:37] New Testament. And Paul t like this. He
[44:42] t he took the same concept that Jesus
[44:45] said in St. John 14. Hallelujah. Paul
[44:49] took it in Colossians 1:27.
[44:51] That's right. Amen.
[44:53] Same concept.
[44:55] He said, "To whom
[44:57] is it?"
[44:58] Colossians 1:27. To whom God make known
[45:01] what is the riches of this of the riches
[45:04] of this of the glorious of this mystery
[45:07] among the Gentiles,
[45:09] which is
[45:11] Christ in you.
[45:12] Amen.
[45:13] The hope of glory.
[45:15] Amen. That was no different than what
[45:17] Jesus was saying in St. John in St. John
[45:20] 14 and verse 20.
[45:22] I am in you.
[45:23] That's right.
[45:24] Paul put it together and pull it in and
[45:26] make it clear. But it was the same
[45:27] revelation.
[45:28] Come on.
[45:29] So we begin. We begin to talk about
[45:31] manifestation. Halleluj. Now I want to
[45:34] begin to hear what kind of manifestation
[45:36] is God looking for for the day or the
[45:39] day that we are in. People got all kind
[45:41] of manifestation. I mean, I said what we
[45:43] done, the majority of people in this
[45:46] message have took the message and
[45:48] preached the Bible right out of it.
[45:51] That's right, brother. Amen.
[45:53] Hold your horses for a minute. You'll
[45:54] see where we going.
[45:55] Hallelujah. Because And what made me
[45:57] take this? I was dealing with a brother
[46:00] and he was in a in a rehab. And brother,
[46:02] he was saying as he was in the rehab, he
[46:05] all he knew was Qu.
[46:08] He did not know the Bible.
[46:10] That's it.
[46:10] I say no. I said it's bad. This boy been
[46:13] reading the message all his life. He
[46:15] don't know that the Bible should have
[46:17] became a new birth.
[46:20] Come on, brother.
[46:20] But he said he didn't even understand
[46:22] the Bible.
[46:23] Oh my.
[46:24] I said, "You can't prove your
[46:25] revelation."
[46:26] That's right.
[46:27] I began to look here. I said, "The
[46:29] reason we got so many courts around the
[46:31] message because they took one quote and
[46:33] build a denomination.
[46:36] If they would have took the quote back
[46:37] to the word of God,
[46:39] they would have showed them what he got
[46:41] already.
[46:41] That's right.
[46:42] But s people don't search the scripture.
[46:45] Come on.
[46:46] They just any any feeling, any
[46:48] sensation. Hallelujah. I got to quote
[46:50] brother say but
[46:53] himself. He always checked his
[46:55] revelation with the scripture.
[46:57] So now we begin to realize here. So we
[46:59] come to the conclusion that what do I
[47:01] believe? I'm prophet or the Bible.
[47:03] Yeah. Right.
[47:04] Now that's the question I'm trying to
[47:07] understand. How can you separate the
[47:10] Bible and the message?
[47:12] That's right.
[47:13] How can you separate the woman from
[47:16] Adam?
[47:17] Come on.
[47:17] Even the very mystery of Adam revealed.
[47:20] Hallelujah. How can you separate the
[47:24] word? The Bible is the word of God.
[47:27] Hallelujah. But the message is what you
[47:29] was in it.
[47:30] Amen. Right.
[47:31] So we begin to look. I said, "Now, how
[47:33] can you separate the prophet and the
[47:35] message?"
[47:36] Oh, right. Right.
[47:37] Let me look it up. I mean, I I took a
[47:39] look up the word in the Greek
[47:40] manifestation of prayer and coming to
[47:42] light me to reveal revelation.
[47:46] Right.
[47:46] Hallelujah. So, begin to look up. So, I
[47:48] had to come up with something that I'm
[47:50] going to try to make it as simple as
[47:52] possible, as simple as I can because I'm
[47:55] going to begin to look at what is your
[47:57] Bible. Your Bible is your road map.
[48:00] Amen.
[48:00] Hallelujah. Your Bible is your road map.
[48:03] Hallelu. When I'm going somewhere, I
[48:06] always search my road map
[48:08] so I can find where I'm going.
[48:11] Honey, if you search the Bible,
[48:13] hallelujah, you'll find out where you
[48:14] at.
[48:15] You'll find out that you come from God.
[48:18] If you're a seed of God, you got to go
[48:20] back the same way.
[48:21] Hallelujah. So, your Bible is your road
[48:23] map.
[48:24] That's right.
[48:24] Everybody clear on that.
[48:26] So you got to you got to have a road map
[48:29] to find your way from point A to point
[48:31] B.
[48:32] He said then what make what do that make
[48:34] your brother? It make your pro your GPS.
[48:38] Hallelujah. It make your brother your
[48:40] GPS. Hallel what the GPS and the ruin
[48:44] mail must say the same thing.
[48:46] Halle
[48:48] your prophet and the Bible. Hal the GPS
[48:52] is the mystery of the road map reveal.
[48:54] That's right. Hallelujah. So in the
[48:57] mystery of the Bible reveal
[49:00] when I want to go somewhere, I come down
[49:02] here this morning. I put in my GPS.
[49:04] Honey, my GPS start. I called brother
[49:07] way. He gave me the address. I punched
[49:09] it in my GPS. And my GPS car me. I
[49:12] normally come another way. I went, but
[49:14] he car me the shortest round.
[49:16] Hallelujah. And he told me, "You turn
[49:18] here. You turn here. And you turn here."
[49:20] And what did he do? And when I be
[49:22] looking at the Bible, I love it. be laid
[49:24] at the wrong mouth. It reveals the place
[49:27] I told you.
[49:28] I knew in other words, if you stay with
[49:30] the prophet, I knew he would take you
[49:32] straight to the word of God. What do GPS
[49:35] mean? GPS mean God provided service.
[49:39] Hallelujah. In other words, God provided
[49:42] way to take you from point A to point B.
[49:45] That's right. Amen.
[49:46] That's right.
[49:47] Hallelujah. Don't let this game use it.
[49:50] He used a brother here and he didn't
[49:53] work. You say, "Well, sometime my GPS
[49:55] car me down a certain road."
[49:58] But you remember sometime your GPS car
[50:00] you off a certain road. When it do you
[50:02] get nervous, you get upset if you if you
[50:05] would let if you would keep driving and
[50:07] you would keep you will keep kind of
[50:09] renewing yourself around. If you notice
[50:11] your if your GPS tell you off the same
[50:13] road, if you keep driving and keep
[50:16] renewing your car around, it will pick
[50:18] back up.
[50:20] How God let you go through a trial that
[50:22] you and you say, "God, you don't let me
[50:25] stay with the GPS."
[50:28] It'll put you right back on the road.
[50:31] Hallelujah.
[50:32] So we begin to look at him.
[50:35] But I said that to say this. So we begin
[50:38] to look at. Why are peoples not
[50:41] understanding the manifestations of the
[50:44] sons of God?
[50:45] Right? Cuz what Jesus said in his own
[50:48] words in St. Matthew 22:29,
[50:52] he says, "And Jesus has said unto him,
[50:55] yeah, you
[50:57] not knowing the scripture,
[51:00] right?
[51:01] Notice the power of God."
[51:04] So he put the arrow there, not because
[51:06] they went to church, not because they
[51:08] were holy, because they didn't know the
[51:10] scripture. And when you don't know the
[51:13] scripture, you don't know where you're
[51:14] going.
[51:16] Amen.
[51:17] If you notice here, Jesus told him this
[51:19] way. Say John 5 and verse 39. Jesus
[51:23] says, "Search the scripture."
[51:27] He went, "Search the scripture."
[51:29] Right?
[51:30] He said, "Search the scripture for in
[51:32] them you think you have eternal life and
[51:34] they or they would testify of me." In
[51:38] other words, he was trying to they
[51:39] trying to find me without certain
[51:42] description.
[51:43] Hallelujah. We find her. So, we got to
[51:45] have some we got to have some evidence.
[51:48] We got to have some physical or some
[51:50] revelated evidence that we are children
[51:52] of God because Jesus said like this.
[51:54] Jesus said like this. He said your name
[51:57] he rejoice because your name is written
[52:00] in heaven.
[52:01] That's right.
[52:02] How can we even comprehend
[52:05] who my name is?
[52:06] That's right. There got to be some
[52:07] evidence in the scripture
[52:09] to let me know I'm the son of God.
[52:11] That's right.
[52:12] There got to be some evidence in the
[52:13] scripture to let me know where I come
[52:15] from and let me know where I'm going.
[52:17] How should we find here till we find in
[52:20] St. John 10 Jesus had to bring out
[52:22] evidence
[52:24] and we got to know who we are. And Jesus
[52:26] say John 10:4 he and verse four and when
[52:30] he put forth his own sheep
[52:32] y
[52:33] he go before them
[52:35] and the sheep follow him
[52:39] for they know his voice
[52:42] so now we realize here if you are son of
[52:45] God you have got the ability to hear the
[52:48] voice of God
[52:50] that tells you who you are
[52:53] and he says he said well no don't matter
[52:55] if you You're not. Oh yes, it does.
[52:58] That's why you find in St. Matthew
[52:59] 13:15-6,
[53:01] he said, "For the peoples, the people's
[53:04] heart is vex gloss
[53:06] and the earth are hearing."
[53:10] So now he bring he put it on he
[53:13] bringing the two seeds and he put them
[53:16] together and he said one of her hear if
[53:18] they cannot hear they are not sons of
[53:20] God.
[53:22] So he putting it here. He's trying to
[53:24] bring evidence
[53:26] that the bride of Christ will have the
[53:29] ability to hear his voice.
[53:31] Amen.
[53:32] That's right.
[53:33] And he said the people, he said their
[53:35] ears are dull hair and their eyes and
[53:40] their eyes they have glow. Lest at any
[53:43] time they should see with their eyes and
[53:46] hear with the earth and and understand
[53:49] with their heart.
[53:51] Amen. Understand with their hearts,
[53:53] right?
[53:54] And he understand with their heart and
[53:57] shall be converted and I shall heal
[53:59] them. In other words, so he put it right
[54:01] here. He except they understand with
[54:03] their heart how they bleed and hear with
[54:05] the earth. But he didn't say why what he
[54:08] did. They not got the ability to hear
[54:11] the voice for that day. Honey, but he
[54:13] said blessed on your eyes.
[54:17] I am blessed. Blessed on your earth and
[54:21] your ear for they can't hear.
[54:23] Hallelujah. My sheep hear my voice.
[54:27] Hallelu. So when we got here, we said,
[54:29] "Well, people say, I want to hear the
[54:31] voice of God." That's the question.
[54:33] Yeah.
[54:33] Come on.
[54:34] The question is the voice.
[54:36] Yeah.
[54:36] The question is, The question is, in
[54:39] other words, so we've been trying to
[54:41] make this thing come out, right? Because
[54:43] everybody trying to hear the voice. How?
[54:45] So we and everybody want to say, "Well,
[54:47] Rachel, I can hear the voice. How I was
[54:49] listening to radio and I hear the voice
[54:51] speak." We hear how the perfect people
[54:53] make uncertain sounds.
[54:55] There many voices.
[54:56] Oh, yeah. How will you detect which one
[54:59] is God and which one ain't God?
[55:02] How you and the only way you will know
[55:04] which one is God? The voice will always
[55:06] line back up with the wrong
[55:11] right.
[55:12] He said it like this in one place
[55:16] just wrote it down here. He said, "Sir,
[55:19] he said God got a voice that he going to
[55:22] use. Surely God would do nothing except
[55:25] he reveals his secret to the servant,
[55:28] the prophet. And the word that word look
[55:30] at the word surely. It means assurance.
[55:33] It means confidence. It means guarantee.
[55:36] Honey, I guarantee that God would not
[55:39] use no other way to add the He would not
[55:42] use no other program. I stand on his
[55:45] spiritual GPS.
[55:47] But God will not use no other way to
[55:49] breathe to make the vital meal without
[55:51] coming through that channel. I don't
[55:53] care how you cut the cake. He always got
[55:55] to go through the GPS.
[55:57] Hallelujah. That's his mystery to
[55:58] reveal.
[55:59] Hallelujah. Go.
[56:02] Bless you.
[56:02] So now we begin to look here. So say the
[56:05] prophet is the GPS. So if the prophet is
[56:08] the GPS, every revelation he got
[56:11] must come from the Bible. Amen.
[56:13] People preach this Bible and he talk
[56:15] about this book and don't brother
[56:17] Brandon preach another Bible.
[56:20] If he preach another Bible, he is a
[56:22] false prophet because Paul preach he I
[56:25] preach the life and I preach what Paul
[56:26] preach.
[56:27] Amen.
[56:28] So we don't want to find make a prophet
[56:30] add to the word of God.
[56:31] Come on.
[56:31] So in so he in the word he say it was he
[56:35] said in word John didn't write it but it
[56:37] was still in the book.
[56:38] Right.
[56:39] He didn't write it but it was still in
[56:40] the book.
[56:40] Come on.
[56:41] What did he write? What did John didn't
[56:43] write? What John didn't write? Sill up.
[56:45] He said seal it up John. Don't write
[56:47] with the seventh under. What did he
[56:49] write? He didn't write the vessel.
[56:51] He didn't reveal who the vessel was. Did
[56:53] he reveal who John was? John had to
[56:56] declare himself by the road man.
[56:58] That's right.
[56:58] I am the voice of one crying in the
[57:00] wilderness.
[57:00] That's right.
[57:01] How he had to declare, I am the vessel.
[57:03] That Jesus said, what did you go out to
[57:05] see?
[57:06] Hallelu. They were looking for the wrong
[57:07] revelation. They were looking for a
[57:09] certain way God
[57:11] found to recognize that God was hid.
[57:17] Hallelujah.
[57:18] He said the message future home page did
[57:22] the prophet revelation had to come from
[57:24] the scripture.
[57:24] Come on. Amen.
[57:25] I don't care what vision he had. I don't
[57:27] care how many dreams he had. It must
[57:29] come back to the road map.
[57:31] If we're going to follow the GPS, it
[57:33] must stay with the road map. Right.
[57:36] future on pay attention.
[57:38] He said, "I always find my message is by
[57:40] prayer."
[57:41] That's right.
[57:42] I be still said I be setting in prayer
[57:46] and something revealed to me. In other
[57:48] words, I don't just jump up when I first
[57:50] hear the first revelation. Hallelujah. I
[57:52] feel that. I know that come from God. I
[57:54] feel it.
[57:54] Oh man.
[57:55] Revelation ain't got nothing to do with
[57:56] filth.
[57:58] Revelation come to do with substance. it
[58:01] to do with God gave it to you and that
[58:03] mean that the devil can't change my
[58:05] mind.
[58:06] Hallelujah. How you know that God gave
[58:08] it to you? You must go back to the road
[58:10] map.
[58:10] That's right.
[58:11] And he said he said something revealed
[58:13] to me and I wait on on it a few minutes
[58:17] and see. And if it's right, then I feel
[58:21] it's closer and closer
[58:23] and then something I keep waiting until
[58:26] it breaks into a vision.
[58:28] Come on. How many more people see the
[58:30] vision, they say that's it? That's all
[58:31] you need.
[58:32] Well, if the only thing if the vision
[58:34] don't line up with the word, then it's
[58:36] antichrist.
[58:37] How many oppose if any angel or any
[58:40] other man from hell preach any other
[58:42] gospel? If it don't line up with the
[58:45] word, it is a false curse.
[58:47] That's right.
[58:49] You said, "Brother Junior, you going to
[58:50] see my man in a minute?" Hallelujah. So,
[58:52] he said, then what he said? He didn't
[58:54] bring it through and when he begin to
[58:57] come and I am satisfied it come from God
[59:01] then I go to the scripture.
[59:03] Hey what do he had to take it back to
[59:06] the right man.
[59:07] Hey when we get something we go to a
[59:10] quote we need to go to the scripture.
[59:12] How the church is all out of bounds now
[59:16] preach right brother.
[59:17] Exactly. He did I go to the scriptures
[59:20] see that see that is the see to be the
[59:24] com the confirmation of the of every
[59:27] spiritual thing that is done because the
[59:30] Bible is the complete revelation of
[59:34] Jesus Christ. See it is his body.
[59:38] So now he say I search it back to the
[59:41] scripture. How do I go back to the
[59:43] scripture? My vision and everything must
[59:46] line up with the Bible. That's right.
[59:48] There you go.
[59:49] If you got a revelation that don't, you
[59:50] need to check it out.
[59:51] That's right.
[59:52] Hallelujah. Because it got to come back
[59:54] to the scripture.
[59:54] Amen.
[59:55] So now we begin to look here because now
[59:57] we we we you know we know that brother
[59:59] Brad we know that brother Brady here. We
[1:00:01] know that brother Brad been here and he
[1:00:02] and his job was his job was not to come
[1:00:06] and bring another Bible.
[1:00:07] That's right.
[1:00:09] His job was not to preach another Jesus.
[1:00:12] His job was to make this Bible
[1:00:15] That's right. become a new book.
[1:00:17] Amen.
[1:00:18] A new Bible.
[1:00:19] And you said this old book,
[1:00:21] does anybody know that this book is just
[1:00:24] a old Bible? That grandmother had it,
[1:00:26] your granddaddy had it, the grandmother
[1:00:28] for that brother had it, your
[1:00:29] grandfather read it.
[1:00:31] So, you know, it's nothing new by just
[1:00:33] looking at a Bible.
[1:00:34] Right. Right.
[1:00:35] So, but the prophecy must become a new
[1:00:38] Bible. He doesn't feed the truth on
[1:00:40] payday. He said he said the Bible became
[1:00:43] a new Bible. Right.
[1:00:46] He said it's it's opened up and revealed
[1:00:50] all the things that the reform of things
[1:00:51] had left out.
[1:00:52] It is the complete revelation of Jesus
[1:00:54] Christ all together
[1:00:56] to us but perfectly exactly not with
[1:01:00] some sensation exactly with the
[1:01:02] scripture.
[1:01:04] The the the word that has been the word
[1:01:08] the word no that was the word which had
[1:01:11] already always been. So now he takes the
[1:01:15] Bible. He say the Bible is a brand new
[1:01:18] life. How you what make it a brand new
[1:01:20] Bible? How you doing? What make it new?
[1:01:22] What make the Bible new? And when it
[1:01:24] begin
[1:01:30] [Music]
[1:01:32] if it ain't turn on flesh, you still
[1:01:34] read
[1:01:36] what you say. You look good. You say now
[1:01:38] you how they going to become a new
[1:01:39] Bible. That's a good question.
[1:01:42] So we find I want to read another quote
[1:01:44] here then I'm going use the prophet
[1:01:47] saying feast that the trumpet paid levy
[1:01:51] he said but god has lied to his people
[1:01:53] of every age is scripture
[1:01:54] right y
[1:01:55] so you know what it is the people trying
[1:01:56] to get some other sensation
[1:01:58] right
[1:01:58] trying to produce something that's not
[1:02:00] scriptural revelation
[1:02:02] so what they doing they trying to
[1:02:03] produce a sensation of producing a court
[1:02:06] trying to make something out of it how
[1:02:08] they are not taking it back to the
[1:02:10] scripture
[1:02:11] honey So he's a he that the god like the
[1:02:14] ever age and ever age in scripture and
[1:02:17] before the egg can come into existence
[1:02:20] at the time the church had got it so
[1:02:23] mixed up
[1:02:25] right
[1:02:25] but trying to interpret the word of God
[1:02:28] without the scripture.
[1:02:29] That's right.
[1:02:30] Amen.
[1:02:31] You cannot take a quote and make it and
[1:02:34] and build a foundation on
[1:02:36] took the Bible and made the foundation.
[1:02:39] How many and it never changed. That's
[1:02:41] right.
[1:02:41] We the one that changed the prophet
[1:02:43] change from there.
[1:02:45] Hallelujah. So you said, "Brother
[1:02:46] Julian, I know he said and they got so
[1:02:48] that they do not even know where they
[1:02:51] failed to recognize Jesus."
[1:02:53] Come on.
[1:02:54] Just being they fa recognize Jesus being
[1:02:57] the son of God.
[1:02:59] Their traditions had blinded their eyes.
[1:03:01] Amen.
[1:03:02] But he was exactly with the scripture.
[1:03:06] So now everything has been done and
[1:03:08] everything have been done. It all goes
[1:03:10] back to one foundation, scripture.
[1:03:13] Hallelujah. So we begin to hear. So we
[1:03:15] realize here. So now we want to I'm
[1:03:17] talking on the manifestations of the
[1:03:18] sons of God. So now we looking at the
[1:03:21] manifestation of the son of God. So that
[1:03:23] impossible
[1:03:25] for anybody to get have understand the
[1:03:29] scripture without a manifestation of the
[1:03:31] son of God.
[1:03:32] Come on.
[1:03:33] Back by the rules of
[1:03:35] them boys could not have a revival.
[1:03:37] No. And then when them boys left from
[1:03:39] the road from Emma, how do they read it?
[1:03:43] A whole book.
[1:03:44] They were reading the old scroll.
[1:03:47] But the scroll needed to put skin on.
[1:03:50] So what did Jesus do? How do Jesus tell?
[1:03:53] He come up and he stepped out in a in a
[1:03:55] in a glorified body.
[1:03:57] A body that the eyes could not recognize
[1:04:00] because Jesus didn't say faith come see
[1:04:02] me.
[1:04:03] He said faith come.
[1:04:06] I see here my Lord. I see my face.
[1:04:09] So he had to reveal himself by a voice,
[1:04:11] by a voice, a scripture voice.
[1:04:14] So when he stepped out, what did he do?
[1:04:16] He went right back to the scripture.
[1:04:18] He went right back to the manifestation
[1:04:20] of the son of God. He went to Moses.
[1:04:23] Amen.
[1:04:23] Why? Because Moses a manifestation of
[1:04:26] God.
[1:04:26] Amen.
[1:04:27] And he took Moses
[1:04:29] and he took the scripture
[1:04:30] and he be to show himself. Come on,
[1:04:33] brother.
[1:04:33] He begin to show himself in the
[1:04:36] scripture,
[1:04:36] right?
[1:04:37] And at ending time,
[1:04:40] at evening time,
[1:04:42] they begin to realize something is
[1:04:44] different.
[1:04:45] Honey, we need to have a revival.
[1:04:47] Come on.
[1:04:48] I don't know where this stranger come
[1:04:49] from, but this man, the way he used it,
[1:04:51] broke the scripture. I never heard it
[1:04:53] like this before.
[1:04:55] So, we need to do they said come on in
[1:04:57] and restrain him in the evening time.
[1:04:59] Why? Because it will be a scripture
[1:05:01] revival. Come on.
[1:05:02] Hallelujah. Open worm and power.
[1:05:04] So what he do? He said, "I want to hear.
[1:05:06] We going to give you the honor to break
[1:05:08] the break."
[1:05:09] That's it.
[1:05:09] And Jesus says,
[1:05:11] "All right."
[1:05:13] Amen.
[1:05:14] He knew when he broke the bread, they
[1:05:15] going to tear the seals over himself.
[1:05:17] Hallelujah. He knew when he broke the
[1:05:19] bread, he going to have to open the
[1:05:21] seals to him. Hallelujah. Because he was
[1:05:22] a seal mystery to him at that time. And
[1:05:24] the resurrection was still sealed to
[1:05:26] him. So once he break the bread, he was
[1:05:29] going to break the seals over him.
[1:05:31] Hallelujah. He broke the bread and he
[1:05:33] get to hand the bread up and begin the
[1:05:35] hand the piece up and he hand the be and
[1:05:37] the bread was not consumed. They
[1:05:39] remember that a one man that can break
[1:05:41] bread like that and not the Messiah
[1:05:45] come on
[1:05:47] when the eyes come on it they knew him.
[1:05:50] But Jesus didn't leave right there
[1:05:53] just to know him.
[1:05:54] That's right.
[1:05:54] Because just to know Jesus alone won't
[1:05:57] move the devil.
[1:05:57] That's right.
[1:05:58] You got to know that he's in you to move
[1:06:00] the devil. Right. How
[1:06:01] you know this? Because you say I quote
[1:06:03] the message don't mean nothing to the
[1:06:04] devil. How they show the way you how you
[1:06:07] know because we had we had the sons of
[1:06:09] it that was under Paul teaching. That's
[1:06:11] right.
[1:06:11] So now when they met the demon they
[1:06:13] quoted Paul we enjoy in the name of
[1:06:16] Jesus what Paul preach the devil said
[1:06:17] you better get out of my face.
[1:06:19] You won't even got a revelation for
[1:06:21] yourself. You hang
[1:06:23] a scripture
[1:06:25] and Jesus did not leave us hanging up
[1:06:27] with the eyes open.
[1:06:28] Come on. Open the eyes of my heart.
[1:06:32] He want the hearts to open to.
[1:06:33] What did he open it to? To understand
[1:06:35] the scripture.
[1:06:36] That's right.
[1:06:36] If you go back to the 45th verse, he
[1:06:38] said he open their understanding
[1:06:41] that they may understand the scripture.
[1:06:43] Hallelujah. He knew if they cannot
[1:06:45] understand the scripture, just know him.
[1:06:47] Hallelujah. When he leave, they going to
[1:06:49] still be in confusion.
[1:06:50] Come on.
[1:06:51] But if they understand the scripture,
[1:06:53] they would not be disappointed.
[1:06:55] That's right.
[1:06:58] Now we begin to look here. Now let's say
[1:07:00] this we don't we don't we done talked on
[1:07:03] Jesus but what do we fit a with the
[1:07:06] scripture with the metal station with
[1:07:08] revelation.
[1:07:08] Where do we come in a good now we always
[1:07:12] we always talk about faith. Everything
[1:07:15] that you got to have is faith.
[1:07:17] You know you you talk to somebody today
[1:07:19] and and the first thing you know they'll
[1:07:21] say brother you got to have faith.
[1:07:23] How do you in other words? Uh, and let
[1:07:25] me just see here in in Hebrews 6,
[1:07:28] Hebrews 11, excuse me. I want to read
[1:07:31] faith.
[1:07:35] And look at faith.
[1:07:37] And God said, "What does that say?
[1:07:40] Faith."
[1:07:42] Okay. Hebrews 11 verse 6.
[1:07:48] And we let just all of us read this one
[1:07:49] together because we talking about faith.
[1:07:51] Yeah.
[1:07:52] Okay. So we won't be we got to have
[1:07:55] this. It says Hebrews 6 Hebrews 11:6 but
[1:07:59] without faith it is what?
[1:08:02] Impossible.
[1:08:04] I don't care how holy you are. I don't
[1:08:06] care how righteous you are. I don't care
[1:08:08] how long you wear your dressing. I don't
[1:08:10] how you but all your shirt. I don't care
[1:08:13] how good you done been to your neighbor
[1:08:16] without faith.
[1:08:17] Amen.
[1:08:18] You just going through emotion.
[1:08:19] Amen. That's right.
[1:08:20] Hallelujah. And so he says here without
[1:08:23] faith it is impossible to please him.
[1:08:27] That's right.
[1:08:29] For he that cometh to God must believe
[1:08:32] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[1:08:34] them that gently seek him. Seek him.
[1:08:37] So now we got to we come up with a
[1:08:39] question. We come up with a question
[1:08:42] because the point of it is all right.
[1:08:44] I'm going to ask you to have faith.
[1:08:46] Right?
[1:08:47] Have faith.
[1:08:48] Right.
[1:08:48] Somebody have faith.
[1:08:50] Right.
[1:08:51] Faith is not like a coat you put on and
[1:08:53] take off.
[1:08:55] Faith is something that you once is
[1:08:57] revealed to you, nobody can change your
[1:08:59] mind about it. That's right.
[1:09:00] So if you got faith, how do you then I
[1:09:03] ask you to have faith? Have faith. You
[1:09:07] all right? I got faith.
[1:09:09] And I know I needed faith. All right.
[1:09:11] You can have enough faith to move
[1:09:13] mountain, cast that doubt, and still not
[1:09:16] have it.
[1:09:16] It's all mine.
[1:09:17] That's right. So now you just got faith
[1:09:19] but have the faith.
[1:09:21] So now it was a different between having
[1:09:24] a faith and def faith.
[1:09:26] Paul said say uh in 1 Corinthians 13
[1:09:29] though I have faith
[1:09:31] I can move mountain
[1:09:33] and have faith to do all these things
[1:09:35] but have not charity I am nothing.
[1:09:38] That's it.
[1:09:39] So is no is no substance that ain't got
[1:09:41] a faith.
[1:09:42] Come on.
[1:09:42] But Paul talk about another faith. What
[1:09:45] that faith was not the faith that cast
[1:09:48] but the faith that I become a son of God
[1:09:53] honey it is the is the faith
[1:09:56] a defaith of the son of god
[1:09:59] so now he brought it to another
[1:10:01] now we need a manifestation in the word
[1:10:04] so we got to have it got to be a channel
[1:10:07] so we can get faith
[1:10:08] right amen
[1:10:09] cuz you can't dream favor
[1:10:11] come on
[1:10:12] you can't shout favor Come on.
[1:10:14] You can't holler faith.
[1:10:16] That's right.
[1:10:16] That God only way when you have faith,
[1:10:18] it must take a manifestation.
[1:10:20] Come on.
[1:10:21] Show me in the scripture. God did it any
[1:10:23] other way.
[1:10:24] Come on.
[1:10:24] So let us go to the book of Romans.
[1:10:26] Romans 10.
[1:10:31] Can we talking about he said for the
[1:10:33] earnest expectation of the creature
[1:10:35] waiting for the manifestation of a son
[1:10:37] of God.
[1:10:38] Hallelujah. So now we need to find here
[1:10:40] order to have faith. They going to have
[1:10:42] to take a manifestation.
[1:10:43] How they going to have to take it they
[1:10:44] going to take a manifestation.
[1:10:46] So now let us go to Romans 10 and I want
[1:10:49] to begin reading something I want you to
[1:10:51] read with me. Honey I'm going to begin
[1:10:52] reading at verse 13. It say whosoever
[1:10:55] shall call up under the name of the Lord
[1:10:58] shall be what?
[1:11:00] Everybody hear that?
[1:11:01] Amen.
[1:11:02] So now everybody that call upon the name
[1:11:04] of Jesus be saved. Hallelujah. The
[1:11:05] brother God said in the revelation of
[1:11:07] the church, he said he a called
[1:11:09] Jesus Jesus Jesus. He said they don't
[1:11:11] get nothing because his name is revealed
[1:11:12] in abundance.
[1:11:14] Hallelujah. When holl Jesus all
[1:11:16] day long me ain't got a revelation.
[1:11:18] All right.
[1:11:19] Jesus is a revelation of the whole
[1:11:21] mystery of God.
[1:11:22] It ain't just it ain't just knowing. And
[1:11:24] when we think about Jesus, we think
[1:11:26] about the revelation of God. It go it
[1:11:29] open up the whole entire mind of God.
[1:11:31] Right. Amen. So he says here, he said,
[1:11:34] "Whoever shall call upon the name of the
[1:11:36] Lord shall be saved."
[1:11:37] Right. Right.
[1:11:38] But the point of it is, how can you call
[1:11:41] on somebody?
[1:11:42] That's right.
[1:11:42] You don't know who he is.
[1:11:43] That's right.
[1:11:44] How can you in other way if we didn't
[1:11:47] know who God was? We wouldn't be no more
[1:11:49] than just the rest of he in the world.
[1:11:51] Come on.
[1:11:52] How do you prove your God? We need a
[1:11:54] manifestation.
[1:11:55] Yeah.
[1:11:56] Something to make God real to us.
[1:11:58] Come on. That's it. So God only way you
[1:12:00] will have a manifestation of God, he got
[1:12:02] to have skin.
[1:12:03] That's right.
[1:12:04] Show me in the scripture what God ever
[1:12:05] made himself known to man without skin.
[1:12:08] Hallelujah. Once he made his revelation
[1:12:09] known and once he revealed it, once
[1:12:12] Abraham received the revelation of the
[1:12:13] body chain, God had skin on.
[1:12:16] Hallelujah. He stood in skin to make the
[1:12:18] mystery live for his age.
[1:12:19] How should we find here? Let us finish
[1:12:21] reading the 14th verse.
[1:12:25] It says, "How then shall they call on
[1:12:28] him and whom they have not what?"
[1:12:31] Believe.
[1:12:31] Hallelujah. So now we got a question.
[1:12:33] They calling on him, but how you going
[1:12:35] to call on him when they have not
[1:12:36] believed?
[1:12:36] That's right.
[1:12:37] Then he going to answer the question.
[1:12:39] And how shall they believe in him whom
[1:12:41] they have not what?
[1:12:43] Amen.
[1:12:43] Heard. In other words, because Jesus
[1:12:46] said, "My sheep hear my voice."
[1:12:49] That's right.
[1:12:50] So if they hear him, how can they call
[1:12:52] them?
[1:12:52] Come on.
[1:12:54] Come on.
[1:12:55] Now you say, "Well, I heard the wind
[1:12:56] blow. He spoke the men."
[1:12:58] Oh my.
[1:12:58] Well, I'm going to tell you what you
[1:12:59] better check it up with the scripture.
[1:13:01] Hallelujah. And he said, "So God got a
[1:13:04] way to break it down." He said, And he
[1:13:06] said, "How shall they hear?" And how
[1:13:09] shall they hear how and go, "And how
[1:13:13] shall they hear without a preacher?"
[1:13:17] I don't say tape recorder. It don't say
[1:13:19] internet.
[1:13:21] It don't say somebody sitting with a
[1:13:23] gift in their life trying to interpret a
[1:13:26] var.
[1:13:31] He is a manifestation of the son of God.
[1:13:35] Thank you.
[1:13:35] That's right, brother.
[1:13:36] Come on.
[1:13:37] He's under the same anointing.
[1:13:40] There's a problem with that.
[1:13:41] And as you heard
[1:13:44] to be made known to make you see the
[1:13:46] word that help your faith to be lifted
[1:13:48] up to another level. I just show you and
[1:13:51] whether you when you didn't think God
[1:13:52] was going to use you preacher. Why would
[1:13:54] God go through the why would Paul go
[1:13:56] through the river more of putting a
[1:13:58] putting Roman E1 in where he put some
[1:14:02] apostle some prophet that is not why he
[1:14:05] want you to understand it must be God
[1:14:07] skin on
[1:14:08] what you looking at this morning you
[1:14:10] don't come to church to look at this
[1:14:11] veil
[1:14:12] you come to look at the mighty
[1:14:14] God
[1:14:15] [Applause]
[1:14:17] that's right blessing
[1:14:20] he says this and he said how
[1:14:24] He said then in the 15th verse, "And how
[1:14:26] shall they preach except they be what?"
[1:14:30] It's a lot different between the word
[1:14:32] sent and went.
[1:14:38] It's a totally different.
[1:14:40] Hallelujah. We got a lot of preachers
[1:14:42] that don't went and all they can say is,
[1:14:43] "Brother Brady said it."
[1:14:46] But can you say, "Can you take him out
[1:14:47] to the scripture and produce the
[1:14:48] revelation?"
[1:14:49] Come on now. Honey, because brother
[1:14:50] Brandon would say it, but he can produce
[1:14:52] it in the scripture. That's why he can
[1:14:54] challenge them people. He didn't say, "I
[1:14:55] approve it by quote." He said, "I tell
[1:14:57] you to bring your Bible."
[1:14:58] That's right.
[1:14:59] Stand beside me and prove it to me.
[1:15:01] Amen.
[1:15:02] Amen.
[1:15:02] That's it, brother.
[1:15:04] That's right.
[1:15:04] We got to learn brother said, "But they
[1:15:06] can't take it to the scripture."
[1:15:08] That's right.
[1:15:08] And if you can't take it to the
[1:15:09] scripture, you ain't got no foundation
[1:15:11] nowhere.
[1:15:11] And so he says here and he said, "How
[1:15:14] shall they preach they be sent as it is
[1:15:16] written? How beautiful are the feasts of
[1:15:19] them that preach the gospel
[1:15:23] of peace and bring glad tidings of good
[1:15:26] land. Now first on he when he done this
[1:15:29] here why would Paul go through the the
[1:15:31] trouble that let you understand feast
[1:15:34] right? Yeah,
[1:15:35] he could have the feet. He wouldn't have
[1:15:37] put eliminated put feet there specific.
[1:15:40] Then we could have said, "Well, it don't
[1:15:41] matter how you hear it going to be tape
[1:15:43] recorder. It could be the internet." But
[1:15:45] remember, the instrument that God uses
[1:15:47] must have feet.
[1:15:48] That's right.
[1:15:50] Amen.
[1:15:52] That's right.
[1:15:53] What he done to get this going to be God
[1:15:54] standing.
[1:15:56] So when he told when he when he come
[1:15:58] down to step your kid, he wanted feet.
[1:16:01] That way he told him to take off your
[1:16:03] shoes.
[1:16:04] How many look at your pretty feet?
[1:16:11] What it was? It was it was a symbolic
[1:16:13] type that God would be standing behind.
[1:16:16] How God would take his possession behind
[1:16:18] his skin.
[1:16:19] That's right.
[1:16:20] That's right.
[1:16:21] Then he go to says,
[1:16:24] "For they have not all obeyed the
[1:16:26] gospel."
[1:16:27] Uhoh.
[1:16:27] For Isaiah said, "The Lord who have
[1:16:31] believed our report."
[1:16:32] Right? In other words, so then faith
[1:16:35] cometh by what?
[1:16:37] How do you and by hearing what?
[1:16:39] Word of God.
[1:16:39] How do how can you hear without what?
[1:16:42] So it would take a manifestation of a
[1:16:45] God with skin on it.
[1:16:47] How do you If he ain't got skin on it,
[1:16:49] how do you don't know who he is, but
[1:16:51] when he come down and make the word
[1:16:53] live.
[1:16:53] That's right.
[1:16:54] He will be able to break the bread and
[1:16:56] the bread won't run out.
[1:16:59] Hallelujah. begin to look at him.
[1:17:03] Hallelujah. Don't think I'm too crazy.
[1:17:05] But
[1:17:06] every time God made the word known to
[1:17:07] anybody, he always had to use skin.
[1:17:09] Once he begin to break the mystery part
[1:17:11] of it, he come behind skin. When Abraham
[1:17:13] met me, he had to have skin on it.
[1:17:15] Hallelujah. The word of God, he made the
[1:17:17] revelation live. He made the word live.
[1:17:20] He made it live behind skin. He put a
[1:17:23] skin on him to make the word live. When
[1:17:25] St. Luke 17 and 30, what the prophecy of
[1:17:29] St. Matthew 17 and 30. What opening the
[1:17:31] scripture?
[1:17:32] What make that scripture come to pass?
[1:17:34] Not because you read it.
[1:17:36] What made the scripture come to pass
[1:17:38] when God had a body available that he
[1:17:40] can step in?
[1:17:41] That's right.
[1:17:42] St. Luke 17 can St. Luke 17:30 couldn't
[1:17:45] open until God had the vessel.
[1:17:47] Neither could God come to the earth
[1:17:49] until the first vessel was there. Her
[1:17:52] first had to be in a certain spot. She
[1:17:54] had to be a chosen one. Right.
[1:17:56] And once she was chosen, the first she
[1:17:58] was blessed of God.
[1:18:00] It was an accident. God know he knew
[1:18:02] her. So all that history all that time
[1:18:05] and see passed down from grandfather to
[1:18:07] grandmother to grandma all the way down.
[1:18:10] And one day the right woman showed up.
[1:18:12] And once the right woman showed up, it
[1:18:15] was time to open the scripture.
[1:18:17] Hallelu. God had skin on it.
[1:18:19] Hallelujah. And when he opened the
[1:18:21] scripture with skin on it, he brought
[1:18:23] Christ to earth. When Christ come to
[1:18:24] earth, he had skin on.
[1:18:26] Honey, when Christ leaves earth, he'll
[1:18:28] have skin on it.
[1:18:31] Hallelujah.
[1:18:32] He didn't just take a theophony body. He
[1:18:35] took a glorified body.
[1:18:37] Hallelujah. Worship.
[1:18:42] Hallelujah. Man, I get where this thing
[1:18:44] come alive.
[1:18:47] Amen.
[1:18:47] So then we find here that he said God
[1:18:49] have skin. He had to have a vessel
[1:18:52] that he could step into to open the
[1:18:54] word.
[1:18:54] Come on.
[1:18:55] If you notice here, when he when John
[1:18:58] was in Revelation 10 and angel begin to
[1:19:00] cut the sin down, Revelation 10 1-4 and
[1:19:03] he told him to fill it up.
[1:19:06] What was he waiting on? The vessel.
[1:19:08] Amen.
[1:19:09] History was waiting on the vessel.
[1:19:11] Amen.
[1:19:11] And once the vessel came on the scene,
[1:19:14] God stepped behind. All right.
[1:19:16] How did he made the scripture it was
[1:19:19] time to break the seal once God's come
[1:19:21] behind his skin because he said the
[1:19:23] seventh seal brought him back to the
[1:19:24] earth. What earth?
[1:19:26] Right. Come on. Amen.
[1:19:28] So we be looking at a god with skin on
[1:19:30] it.
[1:19:31] So now here it is. St. Luke 17:30. Here
[1:19:33] go Abraham come and see three men's
[1:19:35] coming.
[1:19:35] Y
[1:19:36] not not just angelic beings that you
[1:19:39] looking through.
[1:19:40] He seen three men.
[1:19:42] Amen.
[1:19:42] That stepped in scheme. That's right.
[1:19:44] Hallelujah. God come down and blow him a
[1:19:47] body of dust. 16 elements and God
[1:19:50] stepped in. That's right.
[1:19:51] How did Abraham seen them coming?
[1:19:53] Abraham seen three gods.
[1:19:55] Been glad we're in the trinitarian
[1:19:57] today. Hallelujah.
[1:19:58] [Music]
[1:20:00] Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
[1:20:03] But if he would have had that
[1:20:04] revelation, we wouldn't have had a body
[1:20:06] change.
[1:20:07] He had to have the right revelation to
[1:20:08] change his body.
[1:20:10] So that same voice that been speaking to
[1:20:12] him reveal who the person was. So when
[1:20:15] he saw the person without
[1:20:18] he might have heard voices speaking he
[1:20:20] might have seen vision but when he seen
[1:20:22] the person he knew where he was personal
[1:20:29] Abraham seen him coming Abraham bound
[1:20:31] himself
[1:20:32] Abraham said my Lord
[1:20:33] that's right
[1:20:34] single enough
[1:20:36] he say that word I know who this is and
[1:20:38] know where these other two angels they
[1:20:40] might be there but I want to hear Jesus
[1:20:42] only
[1:20:44] hear Jesus Lord, honey, my Lord. I knew
[1:20:46] when Lord saw Lord.
[1:20:48] Of course, he didn't get a body change.
[1:20:50] That's right.
[1:20:51] His wife got a body change, but it was
[1:20:53] kind of he
[1:20:58] if you want to call that, but here it
[1:21:00] is.
[1:21:02] But anyway, we we might hear that when
[1:21:04] he singing and why did God do this
[1:21:06] thing? People when they read the
[1:21:08] scripture here, they read it and they be
[1:21:10] still stay mysterious because they say
[1:21:12] well as it was did he go to L and Son of
[1:21:16] but that was not what God was trying to
[1:21:17] show you.
[1:21:18] What God was trying to show us that in
[1:21:20] the last day before Sonar be burned God
[1:21:23] would be standing on earth with skin on
[1:21:25] it.
[1:21:27] Why do you think Abraham did this?
[1:21:30] He had to do something
[1:21:31] that an angel cannot do.
[1:21:34] That's right.
[1:21:34] He had to break something. He had
[1:21:36] unravel the mystery. He had to open
[1:21:39] something that a angel couldn't do.
[1:21:41] You know what that was? He couldn't
[1:21:42] angel can't eat.
[1:21:44] Angel can't sleep.
[1:21:46] So this man stood back there and had a
[1:21:47] sandwich and drunk the veget. What he
[1:21:49] done there for one purpose? To show you
[1:21:51] the last day revelation. It won't be an
[1:21:53] angel. It'll be God himself. I mean the
[1:21:57] Lord himself from heaven with a shout
[1:21:59] and watching all and the trouble of God
[1:22:02] once the best is on earth. Amen.
[1:22:06] Keep talking. That's good.
[1:22:09] That's it. Amen.
[1:22:11] Skin on it.
[1:22:12] So we begin to look at her.
[1:22:14] I ain't going to keep you all day. Don't
[1:22:15] get nervous. Okay.
[1:22:17] Don't get I'm just kind of preaching
[1:22:20] you. But look here. This unit. This unit
[1:22:24] had the word,
[1:22:26] but it was a dead book.
[1:22:27] Why? I need a manifestation to wake them
[1:22:29] up.
[1:22:30] It need some God to come down there and
[1:22:31] show them what what was in the word. You
[1:22:34] got the unity didn't know what he was
[1:22:35] reading. He was just reading word and
[1:22:37] other word you have to read that show
[1:22:39] you got the will to read.
[1:22:41] But when you see the manifestation of it
[1:22:43] when your pastor stand behind them and
[1:22:44] begin to break those things down and you
[1:22:47] begin to see God that's the
[1:22:48] manifestation. What an angel pastor is a
[1:22:51] god behind.
[1:22:55] So the union would read
[1:22:57] and he probably was a smart man. He was
[1:22:58] raised he was uni. He was in this guy
[1:23:00] was guy probably been to college
[1:23:02] everything. But see, when he got down to
[1:23:04] it, education don't open this mystery.
[1:23:08] So baby, even though he had the ability
[1:23:09] to read, he didn't have the ability to
[1:23:11] understand because he had seen the
[1:23:13] manifestation yet.
[1:23:14] But once he saw the manifestation of the
[1:23:17] son of God, it opened his understanding.
[1:23:19] How do you still read? He going to fill
[1:23:22] up that air and ask him a question. Do
[1:23:24] you understand what you read?
[1:23:26] Man, this man, okay, he said, why didn't
[1:23:28] he have faith? He had some type of
[1:23:29] faith.
[1:23:31] He believed the scripture some type of
[1:23:32] way, but he didn't open it up to him.
[1:23:34] And what did he say? How can I
[1:23:36] understand?
[1:23:37] That's right.
[1:23:38] Except some man teach me except I see or
[1:23:41] not of the son of God. And Phil took the
[1:23:45] scripture and open them up.
[1:23:49] God had skin on him when he did that.
[1:23:50] Amen.
[1:23:52] In other words,
[1:23:53] you go back and you follow Acts 19
[1:23:55] followed
[1:23:58] and they were baptizing in John.
[1:24:00] Yep.
[1:24:01] But they didn't see the Holy Ghost.
[1:24:03] Right. Exactly.
[1:24:03] Cuz they would look if they were looking
[1:24:05] at they said, "We don't even know where
[1:24:07] there be a Holy Ghost." Why they
[1:24:08] couldn't find the Holy Ghost? No other
[1:24:10] place.
[1:24:10] The only place they could find the Holy
[1:24:12] Ghost was in the the body of Christ
[1:24:14] because that's where he was.
[1:24:16] So they going to take the Holy Ghost
[1:24:18] behind his skin to make him see that.
[1:24:19] [Music]
[1:24:21] Glory.
[1:24:22] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:24:24] Amen.
[1:24:25] He says here, he begin to go here. He
[1:24:28] talking about this. I'm talking about a
[1:24:30] god with skin on. Hallelujah. He goes
[1:24:32] right here in the sale book, page two,
[1:24:35] 2:24.
[1:24:37] He said, he said, but he said it was in
[1:24:40] the end time period that the seven
[1:24:42] thunders Jesus came Jesus came forth.
[1:24:48] Revelation 10 1-4 and cried with a loud
[1:24:51] voice
[1:24:53] as a lion roar and when he had cried
[1:24:56] seven thunders uttered their voices and
[1:24:58] when the seven thunders had uttered
[1:25:00] their voices and utter their voices when
[1:25:02] the seven had uttered their voices I was
[1:25:05] about to write
[1:25:07] write what write what he did not reveal
[1:25:11] the
[1:25:13] if he would have revealed the vessel the
[1:25:15] devil would have killed Luther a long
[1:25:16] time ago Right. Yeah.
[1:25:19] If the devil would have knew that Luther
[1:25:21] was going to be the one that raised up
[1:25:23] and only part of that revelation, the
[1:25:24] devil would have got him behind and got
[1:25:26] him off the scene.
[1:25:27] Right.
[1:25:27] Why you think the devil with Jesus Jesus
[1:25:30] coming to Mary was a mysterious birth.
[1:25:33] The devil couldn't tap in on the third
[1:25:34] pool.
[1:25:36] But he knew that Elizabeth had been
[1:25:38] captivated by she had a supernatural.
[1:25:41] So if you notice here, why do you think
[1:25:42] the devil go down there immediately tax?
[1:25:45] Come on. The baby didn't move.
[1:25:48] He was intend to kill John.
[1:25:50] Why did he? Because he knew that God
[1:25:52] couldn't come to the earth except to
[1:25:54] probably come first.
[1:25:54] Oh my.
[1:25:55] Hallelujah. He knew if God that be true
[1:25:58] and Mary testimony is true, then John
[1:26:00] got to be stopped.
[1:26:02] Right.
[1:26:02] Right.
[1:26:04] Blessing.
[1:26:05] God will surely do nothing.
[1:26:07] That's right.
[1:26:07] He knew that.
[1:26:08] Right. Come on. So he said if I could
[1:26:10] stop J birth then that is true that Mary
[1:26:13] testifying because he know that Mary
[1:26:14] didn't have no sensation. He didn't
[1:26:16] understand the mystery of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:17] without sensation.
[1:26:19] So he didn't understand that
[1:26:21] right.
[1:26:23] So we begin to look at him.
[1:26:26] So we realize here it had to be a god
[1:26:28] with skin on it
[1:26:29] before I read the equation system. So
[1:26:32] that way, that way when John was in
[1:26:34] Revelation 11:17,
[1:26:36] you find that John once he saw this
[1:26:38] mighty revelation unfold,
[1:26:41] this mighty revelation unfold, what did
[1:26:44] John say? Let me read that one.
[1:26:46] Yeah.
[1:26:47] Revelation one.
[1:26:50] I'm not ready to parachute. Don't get
[1:26:51] noticed.
[1:26:53] Bless you.
[1:26:54] Cuz y'all got a teacher here. He can
[1:26:56] take me break this stuff down. I won't
[1:26:58] have to worry about this. So I got it
[1:26:59] scattered but he'll know how to go and
[1:27:00] hound this back.
[1:27:03] He said how you know I prayed with him
[1:27:04] before.
[1:27:05] That's right.
[1:27:05] I seen the go with skin on
[1:27:08] we was in Jamaica. was a man
[1:27:10] we got through I can hardly man
[1:27:14] so so
[1:27:16] John revelation the watches in
[1:27:18] revelation one this great mighty
[1:27:20] revelation unfolding to John get beside
[1:27:22] himself emotion over took him
[1:27:25] any time revelation come they got a
[1:27:27] little emotion today once revelation
[1:27:29] start bringing you can't help get stal
[1:27:32] it ain't so much you know today we look
[1:27:34] at the emotion and we got the music jump
[1:27:36] in everybody holling and shout They
[1:27:38] would have told her I'm going to bride
[1:27:40] emotion. Hallelujah. When you know the
[1:27:42] word living on the inside of you, I do
[1:27:44] something bound to take place.
[1:27:45] Amen.
[1:27:46] Amen.
[1:27:47] So when John seen this, Revelation 11:17
[1:27:49] and when I saw And now watch how he read
[1:27:52] this. John Revelation 11:17. And when I
[1:27:56] had when I saw who
[1:27:58] him
[1:28:00] a personal pronoun,
[1:28:02] not them. How did it show him? In other
[1:28:04] words, John revelation had to be the
[1:28:05] same revelation that Abraham did. Once
[1:28:07] he saw it, he had to see one God, too.
[1:28:09] Hallelujah. We don't make too many gods
[1:28:12] out of this message.
[1:28:13] Hallelujah. In other words, we don't
[1:28:14] make too many. He said, "When I saw him,
[1:28:16] I fell at his feet. I fell at his feet
[1:28:19] as dead."
[1:28:20] Right?
[1:28:21] Why he had feet? Because he was, in
[1:28:23] other words, he was he was in a angelic
[1:28:25] presence. He was in that angelic
[1:28:28] presence. He seen that being that
[1:28:29] supernatural revelation. Hallelujah. In
[1:28:31] other words, something was unfolding
[1:28:32] here. Hallelujah. But John, I got up
[1:28:34] beside myself. I fell in his feet this
[1:28:36] day.
[1:28:37] Amen.
[1:28:38] And watch what this and this this had be
[1:28:41] unfold. And he laid his right hand upon
[1:28:43] me
[1:28:44] and said unto me,
[1:28:46] fear not.
[1:28:46] Amen.
[1:28:48] Hallelujah.
[1:28:48] Amen.
[1:28:49] Fear not.
[1:28:50] For I am the first and the last.
[1:28:54] It can't nobody be the first and the
[1:28:55] last but God.
[1:28:57] And I am he that liveth and was what?
[1:29:02] and and behold, I'm alive forever more.
[1:29:06] Amen.
[1:29:08] And hell, the keys
[1:29:11] of hell and a death. He was said, "I'm a
[1:29:16] dead
[1:29:17] way." What would he say? What you say in
[1:29:19] John is already been covered.
[1:29:22] Amen.
[1:29:23] And it was so when John find Revelation,
[1:29:26] he goes to Revelation 5.
[1:29:27] Yep.
[1:29:28] Yep.
[1:29:29] He seen this revelation open him but he
[1:29:31] you know he no doubt he could not
[1:29:33] comprehend everything was going on. So,
[1:29:34] Revelation B, he got John knew the only
[1:29:37] way the seals could ever be broke, God
[1:29:40] had to be have skin on him,
[1:29:41] right?
[1:29:42] So now John himself, he getting all and
[1:29:44] then went to Revelation 5 without he
[1:29:47] told John to find me a man.
[1:29:49] Right.
[1:29:49] First off, John didn't buy a man, but
[1:29:51] everybody was born by sex.
[1:29:54] So John knew there was no manifestation.
[1:29:57] That's right.
[1:29:57] If it was no manifestation, there ain't
[1:29:59] going to be no revival. Right. Right.
[1:30:00] And John knew if they're going to take a
[1:30:02] manifestation with a godly skin on it or
[1:30:04] else the whole thing over with.
[1:30:05] Why you think the man would cry?
[1:30:08] He had looked in heaven. He had looked
[1:30:09] on earth. John the Baptist had they had
[1:30:11] an interview with him. Why the man I'm
[1:30:13] not worthy.
[1:30:14] Why? Because the scripture said he
[1:30:16] would.
[1:30:18] So now he was crying and then he say I
[1:30:21] hear the voice say, "Behold your weep
[1:30:23] not
[1:30:25] behold
[1:30:27] the line of the tribe of Judah." Amen.
[1:30:30] The root and offspring of David has
[1:30:32] prevailed to take the book John turn to
[1:30:34] look what he see.
[1:30:36] Why did he see lamb? Because that's
[1:30:37] incarnated God.
[1:30:38] I mean when you talk to God when John
[1:30:41] the Baptist saw it and John the Baptist
[1:30:44] when he walk in the water he saw
[1:30:45] incarnated water. Behold
[1:30:48] the lamb of God.
[1:30:50] When he saw the spirit it was in the
[1:30:51] form of the door.
[1:30:52] Right?
[1:30:53] So when you see the word lamb is
[1:30:55] incarnated.
[1:30:57] So God was incarnated. When John see the
[1:30:59] incarnated word, he knew the seals was
[1:31:02] open. He knew that God would break the
[1:31:03] word. I mean, so he start howling and
[1:31:05] shouting and praising God. While he go,
[1:31:07] he knew right there. It was already paid
[1:31:10] for and his name was on the book.
[1:31:13] Then he goes on.
[1:31:15] So that revelation, that revelation kind
[1:31:18] of and it moves on and it moves on and
[1:31:21] then we need another manifestation. So
[1:31:22] John has another manifestation with
[1:31:25] Revelation 11:17. He turned around had
[1:31:27] the same manifestation
[1:31:29] with Revelation 19 and 10.
[1:31:33] Because when he saw this angel,
[1:31:36] he done the same thing. He
[1:31:38] he fell and he started to worship.
[1:31:40] How the other he felt dead, but now he
[1:31:42] deceived in Revelation 5 was open. So he
[1:31:44] saw this angel. This time he worshiped
[1:31:46] him.
[1:31:47] But this angel in Revelation 19:10, he
[1:31:50] would not receive worship.
[1:31:51] That's right.
[1:31:52] Why? Even though he was when he went to
[1:31:54] worship this angel, this angel
[1:31:55] immediately let him know it ain't me.
[1:31:58] Come on.
[1:31:59] In the mighty God, he had his skin.
[1:32:00] Amen.
[1:32:01] Worship God. John, don't worship me. He
[1:32:04] pointed him back to the word.
[1:32:05] Amen.
[1:32:08] Hallelujah. Had to do it.
[1:32:10] Right.
[1:32:10] So he says here,
[1:32:13] he says, he said in the last period in
[1:32:16] the last in the last time period that
[1:32:18] the seven thunders of Jesus will come
[1:32:21] forth. Revelation 10:1-3 and cried with
[1:32:24] a loud voice and when a lion ro and when
[1:32:26] he had cried seven thunders uttered
[1:32:28] their voices and and when the seven
[1:32:31] thunders had uttered their voices
[1:32:33] and when the seven thunder had uttered
[1:32:35] their voices I was about to write and I
[1:32:37] heard a voice from heaven and he seven
[1:32:40] thunders uttering but one voice speaking
[1:32:43] seven but one voice speak
[1:32:48] I would not luke the message it would
[1:32:49] not lit It was the voice of God for
[1:32:54] it was God manifesting himself behind
[1:32:56] skin that
[1:32:58] but we always get the vessel mixed up
[1:33:01] we always trying to worship give glory
[1:33:02] to flesh
[1:33:04] we need to give glory to God he's not
[1:33:05] here
[1:33:07] we don't need a return we don't need
[1:33:09] once the seal the voice is here now you
[1:33:12] know here because the ministry still
[1:33:14] lives on
[1:33:16] we really when the bride have a revival
[1:33:19] he was going all night.
[1:33:21] What do you see consisting and better
[1:33:24] than the pastor?
[1:33:25] That's right.
[1:33:25] What it is is God behind skin.
[1:33:28] Amen.
[1:33:30] And I hear the voice of him saying unto
[1:33:31] me, send up those things which the seven
[1:33:33] thunders uttered and write them not. And
[1:33:36] I what was in those seven thunders? No
[1:33:39] one know. But we need to know and it
[1:33:43] will and it will take a prophet. Now it
[1:33:46] goes right.
[1:33:47] Why did he go to a prophet? because he
[1:33:49] knew that was God's GPS.
[1:33:51] Hallelujah. He knew if God going to make
[1:33:52] it known, he got to be a prophet on
[1:33:53] earth to reveal the map.
[1:33:55] Hallelujah. So he knew that it going to
[1:33:57] be it was not he knew that the seven
[1:33:59] thunder would not open until the man was
[1:34:02] on the scene.
[1:34:03] So you realize here do you let me
[1:34:05] I'm getting ready.
[1:34:07] I want you to notice right here. Do you
[1:34:09] realize why do you think that the
[1:34:12] prophet when he got to Cal Egypt God say
[1:34:15] stop
[1:34:16] right? Why you think he stopped him from
[1:34:18] going into Israel? Brother never went to
[1:34:20] Israel, by the way. He wanted his desire
[1:34:22] to go to Israel. Why you think that the
[1:34:25] prophet had to stop before he go Israel?
[1:34:27] Because of that body would have put his
[1:34:30] feet on that ground. It would have
[1:34:31] opened the scripture.
[1:34:33] That's right.
[1:34:34] Because the feet of the trumpet
[1:34:36] revelation 11 where he open that seal is
[1:34:39] on two trumpets of the two brothers.
[1:34:41] That's right.
[1:34:41] And brother would have been ahead of the
[1:34:43] time and the scripture can't be broken.
[1:34:45] Right.
[1:34:46] Amen.
[1:34:47] That was to show you that was Elijah
[1:34:49] behind skin or God behind skin.
[1:34:52] Hallelujah. So, so God said, "No,
[1:34:54] I cannot let you take this body and step
[1:34:57] on Israel's soul. If you do it, you'll
[1:34:59] break every scripture
[1:35:00] because when Elijah shows up,
[1:35:02] right,
[1:35:02] Israel heart immediately will turn back.
[1:35:04] Glory. Exactly.
[1:35:06] Blessed.
[1:35:08] That's right.
[1:35:09] It would take a prophet to reveal. It
[1:35:11] would take a prophet to get the
[1:35:12] revelation. that God had no other way to
[1:35:16] bring it out,
[1:35:17] right?
[1:35:18] Bring it out of his scripture,
[1:35:19] right?
[1:35:20] So, it was in the scripture all the
[1:35:21] time, but there was no other way to
[1:35:23] bring it out.
[1:35:24] So, we had to wait till the vessel come
[1:35:26] in order to understand the scripture.
[1:35:28] That's why we probe that do seven
[1:35:29] churches because the woman can't give a
[1:35:31] light,
[1:35:31] right? The woman has not carried to
[1:35:33] carry a light. So, it going to take the
[1:35:36] body. It going to take the man to be on
[1:35:38] earth to make the scripture live.
[1:35:40] Amen. So if you notice after he get this
[1:35:42] revel agent right here immediately he
[1:35:44] seals the wound of the bride
[1:35:46] why it's time to put skin on the word
[1:35:49] once you get your wound seal time to put
[1:35:50] it in flesh
[1:35:52] so he says he didn't reveal exactly what
[1:35:55] he reveals exactly by a prophet the word
[1:35:58] always
[1:35:59] come by a prophet and always will
[1:36:05] get ready I want you to notice here we
[1:36:08] can just go on and on It ain't no use
[1:36:10] for I want to read one on the on the
[1:36:13] body now because it's you. It ain't just
[1:36:15] it ain't just what brother was saying.
[1:36:18] Once the revelation come and you receive
[1:36:19] this revelation and recognize this
[1:36:21] revelation being eagleful, you are
[1:36:23] changed
[1:36:24] into the image of the living God. You
[1:36:27] have heard from your theology. You know
[1:36:29] where you come from and you know where
[1:36:30] you're going.
[1:36:32] How does your in the book of doct page
[1:36:34] 56 what is the body of Christ? Amen.
[1:36:38] The question was that what is the body
[1:36:39] of Christ?
[1:36:41] He says some are apostles,
[1:36:43] some are prophets,
[1:36:45] some are teachers, some are evangelist
[1:36:48] and some are pastors. Is that right? We
[1:36:52] call others and then you start dealing
[1:36:54] with gifts.
[1:36:55] Yeah.
[1:36:56] People come to this message and we say,
[1:36:57] "Well, we ain't got no more gifts." No,
[1:36:58] he didn't put it in order.
[1:37:00] A true gift always works. You can't
[1:37:02] stop, you can't shed down a water. You
[1:37:04] can't hold up a whale and pump it on his
[1:37:06] own. Right.
[1:37:07] If you got a true gift in his life, how
[1:37:09] if we get out of order, we just put it
[1:37:11] back in the right place.
[1:37:14] We didn't need to be tied. Hallelujah.
[1:37:16] That's right.
[1:37:17] We put the people tied out in the
[1:37:18] church. We don't need that. We
[1:37:20] revelation. Show me what God took it
[1:37:22] out. Amen.
[1:37:23] Exactly. That's right.
[1:37:24] It just ain't emphasis. We don't put
[1:37:26] emphasis on. But if God want to get up
[1:37:28] here and speak in tong, give me
[1:37:29] interpretation. And when we talk about
[1:37:31] tongues,
[1:37:32] we ain't talking about the Lord saying
[1:37:33] you blessed. But I didn't read the word
[1:37:35] know that. Right.
[1:37:37] That's right.
[1:37:37] But when you talk about tongues and
[1:37:39] interpretation, it reveal something
[1:37:41] that's here.
[1:37:43] Right.
[1:37:43] Do you realize in brother Godwin church,
[1:37:45] anybody from Kamasi, West Africa?
[1:37:49] But anyway, in brother Godwin church in
[1:37:51] West Africa, his church is so gifted.
[1:37:55] Even when I went, man, I had a prayer
[1:37:57] buddy.
[1:37:58] Hey, brother. They told me said, "Man,
[1:38:00] you better pray,
[1:38:02] man. I put everything I had in the
[1:38:04] blood. Man, every nerd up.
[1:38:07] Brother God church is so gifted. A
[1:38:09] brother had committed adultery. Never
[1:38:11] mentioned hidden in another city.
[1:38:15] Was an elder in the church. Hallelujah.
[1:38:18] Sister with the Holy Ghost stood up.
[1:38:20] Amen.
[1:38:20] In order not against what the preacher
[1:38:22] was preaching.
[1:38:23] Hallelujah. It was a open rebuke because
[1:38:25] it was a open singing.
[1:38:26] Hallelujah. So what did she do? She
[1:38:28] stands up and she starts speaking in
[1:38:30] tongue. A man in the back turning the
[1:38:33] Lord say how he went going around. The
[1:38:35] Lord said somebody here come and do a
[1:38:36] sh. No. He said let this out. They going
[1:38:38] to use a fix your name and he had the
[1:38:41] Lord say brother Jeff. He was up doing a
[1:38:43] job a couple weeks ago and he went out
[1:38:45] and laid and had a little lady. She had
[1:38:48] a black hair set up and the man jumped
[1:38:50] up. He ain't nothing the truth and
[1:38:52] repenting.
[1:38:53] That's a true gift of God.
[1:38:55] And you can't take that out of the
[1:38:57] church because he ain't put it in the
[1:38:59] church to keep it clean.
[1:39:00] Right. Amen.
[1:39:02] That's right.
[1:39:02] We had that back in the church. There be
[1:39:03] a lot of this internet junk people call.
[1:39:06] How a lot of filth people got called up
[1:39:09] into how they hiding the sin. How they
[1:39:11] committing adultery. How you say, "Well,
[1:39:13] brother Joe, I ain't never tell." How
[1:39:15] you sit there and flirt all day long
[1:39:16] with some man on the internet that you
[1:39:18] don't even know. Now let the same thing
[1:39:21] you can you guilty of a devil if you
[1:39:23] take it or not
[1:39:24] know if it not by the way
[1:39:25] right.
[1:39:27] Let me leave it alone.
[1:39:29] He says here we get right here. He said
[1:39:32] and other gifts and tongues
[1:39:34] interpretation of the tongue wisdom,
[1:39:36] knowledge, miracles, working of
[1:39:38] miracles.
[1:39:38] That's right.
[1:39:39] All those different divine
[1:39:42] gifts.
[1:39:43] God is still doing the same thing that
[1:39:45] he did with brother Brandon here. But he
[1:39:47] just ain't doing it to get men or it
[1:39:49] going to be one man show. It going to be
[1:39:50] a minister. It going to be in the body
[1:39:52] of Christ.
[1:39:53] I might have a gift to do this people.
[1:39:55] You know I I tell people listen what you
[1:39:57] preach. I preach deliverance.
[1:39:59] I mean you know I preach deliverance.
[1:40:01] How do God be a man one way? I don't try
[1:40:03] to pull in on another man territory. I
[1:40:05] preach deliverance. I been in Jesus
[1:40:07] Christ as the same as he was yesterday,
[1:40:09] today. He standing right behind his
[1:40:11] word. If he don't stand behind the
[1:40:12] world, we got a right to throw the Bible
[1:40:14] away. Throw his mess away. Man, I don't
[1:40:16] need a dead god a dead history.
[1:40:18] If he's real, then he need to step
[1:40:20] behind it.
[1:40:21] And I know he will. He got time after
[1:40:24] time after time.
[1:40:25] Just left Ohio.
[1:40:27] Just left Ohio. Why was in Ohio? Got a
[1:40:30] call from a sister from down inside. She
[1:40:32] said, "I got a her say he's an older
[1:40:35] man. He got cancer and during his chemo,
[1:40:38] he got he done got himself out of
[1:40:41] bounds, you know. He fell and he broke
[1:40:43] his broke his arm
[1:40:46] and then he it started to heal and he
[1:40:49] out again. He fell and done popped it
[1:40:51] again.
[1:40:52] So she knew this thing. She would call
[1:40:53] him. She said, "Bru, I didn't know the
[1:40:55] man." I put it in my GPS. She gave me I
[1:40:57] said, "I'll go pray for him." I said,
[1:40:58] "Do what you want." Hallelujah. So we
[1:41:00] went down there. We drove an hour and a
[1:41:02] half down there where he was. He was
[1:41:03] expecting. So we come in. We talked to
[1:41:05] him a little bit about God. I said, "Now
[1:41:07] that prayer for you now." I said, "I
[1:41:08] ain't got to just say the Lord that God
[1:41:10] gonna do something for this man, but I
[1:41:11] ain't got to just say the Lord he
[1:41:12] ain't."
[1:41:13] Hallelujah.
[1:41:14] So all I need to do is pray the prayer
[1:41:16] of faith and lead the rest up to God.
[1:41:18] Hallelujah. So we did what the
[1:41:19] scriptures say we pray for. But I did
[1:41:21] say that I said God that they this
[1:41:23] family know that you are real that we
[1:41:25] are not presenting the day of God. Let
[1:41:27] them see a miracle. Amen.
[1:41:30] You said what happened? What you think
[1:41:31] happened? They saw a miracle.
[1:41:36] The doctor the doctor raise that arm and
[1:41:38] the doctor come out even come out said
[1:41:40] this got to be a miracle
[1:41:43] say it got to be a miracle your shoulder
[1:41:45] look as good as a 17y old boy
[1:41:49] let you know Jesus Christ is still doing
[1:41:51] the same thing
[1:41:53] and by God to throw the boulders in why
[1:41:56] you went there for the army here he said
[1:41:58] I don't even understand your blood c was
[1:42:00] falling now your sales are building back
[1:42:02] up and fighting the c on the
[1:42:04] Jesus Christ yesterday
[1:42:11] we done here. Hallelujah. But we got to
[1:42:12] know how we got to let go. We got to
[1:42:15] know who living on this
[1:42:20] Thank you, Lord.
[1:42:21] Come in as the musicians get ready to
[1:42:23] come.
[1:42:25] Thank you, Lord.
[1:42:26] Hallelujah. Musician,
[1:42:27] take it back. I'm going to You know when
[1:42:30] I was in the world,
[1:42:31] God bless you. God bless you, sir. When
[1:42:34] I was in the world, I went into
[1:42:36] football.
[1:42:38] I went into basketball.
[1:42:40] I ain't and I'm not got nothing against
[1:42:42] him. I I need to get out and do a little
[1:42:44] bit of basketball doing something.
[1:42:48] I'm not against himself. I'm just saying
[1:42:49] I didn't do it. I was into boxing.
[1:42:53] I love boxing. Kickboxing. I kickboxed
[1:42:55] for three years and more and I had one
[1:42:58] more belt for being a black belt. I
[1:43:00] really was into that kickboxing stuff.
[1:43:02] But my favorite champion was, and you
[1:43:05] know how to say his name,
[1:43:07] Muhammad Ali.
[1:43:09] And the reason I like Muhammad Ali so
[1:43:11] good because he declared himself to be
[1:43:14] the best.
[1:43:16] He said, "We told him I said he told
[1:43:18] himself." I mean, he declared himself to
[1:43:22] be the champion of the world.
[1:43:24] Nobody didn't tell him and nobody
[1:43:26] couldn't talk it out of him.
[1:43:28] He was the champion. If you like it or
[1:43:30] not, how you know who told him that? He
[1:43:32] told himself.
[1:43:33] That's right. Amen.
[1:43:35] And I say, you know, Muhammad Ali said,
[1:43:36] "I'm the champion."
[1:43:37] That's right.
[1:43:38] And he begin to confess and he begin to
[1:43:40] believe it. And he begin to talk it. His
[1:43:42] body begin to perform.
[1:43:44] He didn't even know God that you know he
[1:43:46] was a Muslim that believed in the
[1:43:48] So he believed in his faith. Faith no
[1:43:51] matter what level you walking on, he'll
[1:43:52] work for you. of Muhammad Ali said. But
[1:43:54] the point what made Muhammad Ali the
[1:43:56] best was not because he never been beat.
[1:44:00] It's because he never acknowledged it.
[1:44:03] How can he beat a man if he don't
[1:44:05] acknowledge?
[1:44:06] Why do you think we over there fighting
[1:44:08] over there overseas fighting a bunch of
[1:44:09] people we'll never beat because they
[1:44:11] can't understand.
[1:44:13] That's right.
[1:44:14] We just wasting time.
[1:44:15] Right.
[1:44:16] So you need money.
[1:44:17] Yeah. When you chose Muhammad Ali, it
[1:44:20] was the problem with Joe Fraser fighting
[1:44:22] Muhammad Ali. If anybody else saw that
[1:44:24] fight, Joe Fraser beat the man.
[1:44:26] Amen.
[1:44:27] I literally beat the man. It was no, it
[1:44:30] was no great camera to that. He was
[1:44:32] smoking Joe beat the man.
[1:44:35] But the problem was Muhammad Ali didn't
[1:44:37] know it.
[1:44:41] He didn't know he would beat
[1:44:43] I'm the champion. I said, you know, if
[1:44:46] we come to that revelation, we'll show
[1:44:48] confusion the devil.
[1:44:50] If the devil knock you down, you get
[1:44:51] back and say, "The greatest he is in
[1:44:52] me." The devil said, "I don't know what
[1:44:54] to do with these people."
[1:44:56] Hey, I don't know what to do with these
[1:44:57] people.
[1:44:59] Every time I die, they get back and
[1:45:01] praise God.
[1:45:04] But he says here, "And at the end of the
[1:45:06] day, I'm closing with this. They go to
[1:45:10] get all the former champions.
[1:45:13] Joe Fraser, George Foreman, Ken Norton,
[1:45:17] Space, Holmes. They have a whole line of
[1:45:20] them sitting at a table. At this time,
[1:45:23] Muhammad Ali speech is real blur
[1:45:26] and his mind is kind of in and out. And
[1:45:30] he was sitting around the table and
[1:45:32] everybody was talking about the glorious
[1:45:33] days of being champion. And Muhammad Ali
[1:45:36] did like this.
[1:45:38] He says, "I'm the best." And every one
[1:45:41] of them says, "Amen."
[1:45:44] He told his enemies so low,
[1:45:47] he told his opponent so low he was the
[1:45:49] best. They start believing it.
[1:45:52] He told him so long and they start
[1:45:54] testifying. He was the best.
[1:45:57] Oh, hallelujah. We got We got scripture
[1:45:59] to put the devil on the run. Right.
[1:46:02] Amen.
[1:46:02] But what mattered me about him more than
[1:46:04] anything,
[1:46:06] he believed his Bible.
[1:46:09] Muhammad Ali believed in the Quran.
[1:46:12] He believed his Bible so much that he
[1:46:15] was not satisfied
[1:46:18] the name classic clay.
[1:46:21] Right.
[1:46:21] He feel like he was not giving his Bible
[1:46:23] enough praise.
[1:46:25] Muhammad Ali said, "I can't take this
[1:46:27] thing right here being just being
[1:46:29] classic clay." Hallelujah. Class of CL.
[1:46:31] Hallelujah. He said, "No, I want to be
[1:46:32] more identified with my Bible."
[1:46:34] So he changes his name
[1:46:37] to his Bible.
[1:46:38] Why? Because he wanted to be the mystery
[1:46:40] of the Quran revealed. Hallelujah. So he
[1:46:42] said, "I am called Muhammad Ali." He was
[1:46:46] identifying himself with his Bible. I
[1:46:48] said, "You know that is it." I said,
[1:46:49] "Now you know, we done come here." That
[1:46:51] was getting to move the bride up to one
[1:46:53] place. How you mean? If you notice here,
[1:46:55] he be moving us up. He said, "I don't no
[1:46:56] longer call you church. I call you
[1:46:58] brother." So he brought us from one
[1:46:59] level and but you remember we got to go
[1:47:01] in and they coming out and the church is
[1:47:03] coming out bright. We have halfway there
[1:47:05] but we're not all the way down. Why you
[1:47:07] not all the way? Because God would never
[1:47:10] pregnant you and
[1:47:10] bride.
[1:47:11] He will pregnant his wife.
[1:47:13] Amen.
[1:47:14] So you can have a bride and she still
[1:47:16] not be pregnant. When you sitting at the
[1:47:18] marriage supper and you and your wife
[1:47:19] sitting there, you're eating. She's not
[1:47:21] your wife.
[1:47:22] Hallelujah. She's not your wife and you
[1:47:24] take her to the honeymoon.
[1:47:26] Hallelujah. Once you take the honey that
[1:47:28] we see follow you.
[1:47:30] Hallelujah. So we we just good enough.
[1:47:33] Hallelujah. I got my bride. No.
[1:47:35] Come on. Right.
[1:47:37] I'm not a bride.
[1:47:38] Come on.
[1:47:39] I didn't win a lot more than bride.
[1:47:40] Right.
[1:47:40] Cuz my scripture don't call me bride.
[1:47:43] My scripture said the wife.
[1:47:45] Honey. If I'm a wife, that mean I'm
[1:47:47] already pregnant. Honey, the wound of
[1:47:48] life is already fil. And I cannot commit
[1:47:51] adultery. Honey, I'm already caught up.
[1:47:53] The word is already in blood and I wound
[1:47:56] it as white now. He would never pregnant
[1:47:59] you till you become wife.
[1:48:01] Do you know him as wife?
[1:48:03] I no longer call me bride. Call me wife.
[1:48:06] Come on.
[1:48:06] Hallelujah.
[1:48:07] Amen.
[1:48:09] Would you give me say
[1:48:14] that? Praise God.

[1:49:59] Now I ain't got no power to move it.
[1:50:01] That's right.
[1:50:02] But I got authority what Jesus said. But
[1:50:04] there two or three gathered in his name.
[1:50:06] And if we could touch it and agree to
[1:50:08] anyone from it, say it will bring it to
[1:50:10] pass. That's right.
[1:50:11] Hallelujah. I don't care how many time
[1:50:13] the devil bring a rattlesnake to you.

[2:00:36] of the Lord.
[2:00:37] I believe in it. God will just bless and
[2:00:40] take care of you. Right. All right. So,
[2:00:42] just look forward to that.
[2:00:44] While you're eating, while you're doing,
[2:00:46] just think about it.
[2:00:47] That's right.
[2:00:49] God living in
[2:00:52] two feet. Your feet,
[2:00:54] right?
[2:00:55] Walking on earth.
[2:00:56] That's right.
[2:00:56] As the word made flesh.
[2:01:01] Like the brother said, which is the
[2:01:03] greater? In other words, great signs and
[2:01:05] wonders taking place or a child of God
[2:01:07] born again, which is a greater for you.
[2:01:09] That's right.
[2:01:11] Because if you you get the child born
[2:01:13] again, it's going to be greater things.
[2:01:15] Heard the prophet one day say, he said,
[2:01:16] "I'd rather see perfect love than to see
[2:01:20] either five or 10,000 people healed or
[2:01:22] something like that." And I thought,
[2:01:24] "Oh, Lord."
[2:01:25] You know, he said, "I'd rather see that
[2:01:27] perfect love there."
[2:01:29] And then the minute he come around he
[2:01:30] said because if that perfect love is
[2:01:32] there and that faith he said there'll be
[2:01:34] 50,000
[2:01:36] that are healed tonight.
[2:01:39] Just believe in God. Tell the brother
[2:01:40] how much you appreciate the God.
[2:01:42] Father we thank you for the day and we
[2:01:44] pray that you would just bless each one
[2:01:46] that our hearts would be open unto you
[2:01:48] to be able to receive. We pray that you
[2:01:50] would just bless each one Lord. And we
[2:01:53] believe each one of these that was
[2:01:54] prayed for receive what they were asking
[2:01:56] for. Amen. We believe and we thank you.
[2:01:58] Thank you for the message and we pray
[2:02:00] you give our brother strength and
[2:02:02] comfort then for this afternoon Lord and
