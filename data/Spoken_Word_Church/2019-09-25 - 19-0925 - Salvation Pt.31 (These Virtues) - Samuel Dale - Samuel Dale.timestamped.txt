[4:29] guide us now and keep us in Jesus name
[4:32] Amen
[4:34] 1st Peter 1 we've been reading this for
[4:38] a while trying to get out to some
[4:42] interesting points anyway so Simon Peter
[4:45] is serving an apostle of Jesus Christ to
[4:48] them that have obtained like precious
[4:50] faith with us through the righteousness
[4:53] of God and our Savior Jesus Christ
[4:55] now written to whom this is not written
[4:57] to the world this is written to
[5:00] Christians alright now I'll say this
[5:04] over again in a minute the stature of a
[5:06] perfect man is not controlling about the
[5:10] new birth as much as it's talking about
[5:14] the growth development in your
[5:18] Christianity it's not just dealing with
[5:21] the the birth the birth Peter covers
[5:23] over the chapter before sin you know
[5:26] talking about how that you're being
[5:29] warned again alright see then it comes
[5:32] into this situation so look at it like
[5:34] that now think about it those this is
[5:36] written into the church to tell her how
[5:39] to become to where he was at
[5:41] all right this is Grace and peace be
[5:43] unto you through the knowledge of God
[5:46] and of Jesus our Lord according as his
[5:48] divine power has given unto us all
[5:50] things that pertain unto life and
[5:53] godliness through the knowledge of him
[5:55] that have called us to glory in virtue
[5:57] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[5:59] great and precious promises that by
[6:03] these you might be partakers of the
[6:05] divine nature having escaped the
[6:07] corruption that is in the world through
[6:09] lust see that's not a that's a
[6:11] born-again Christian if you're talking
[6:13] to you know in trying to get them to
[6:16] move on then and besides this then it
[6:20] right besides this
[6:22] that's what besides being of like
[6:26] precious faith
[6:28] besides being of them that are of
[6:31] talking about the divine nature and that
[6:34] have have you know gotten rid of the
[6:36] corruption that is in the world through
[6:38] lust in other words our born-again
[6:41] Christian right
[6:43] all right and besides this giving all
[6:47] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[6:50] to virtue of knowledge and the knowledge
[6:52] temperance and to temperance patience
[6:54] and to patience godliness and to
[6:56] godliness kindness and to brotherly
[6:59] kindness charity for if these things be
[7:02] in you and abound they make you that you
[7:04] may you shall neither be barren nor
[7:07] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[7:09] Jesus Christ you may be seated the Lord
[7:13] that is blessing for the reading of the
[7:14] words well now follow the point of what
[7:18] I just said and it will help us see
[7:21] Peter is speaking to born-again
[7:24] Christians them of like precious faith
[7:28] all right now I know that there's a
[7:31] doctrine in the message that's teaching
[7:34] that you don't have the new birth until
[7:37] you get all the virtues well I don't
[7:39] agree with that I mean I'm serious I
[7:41] don't think the Prophet did that's why I
[7:43] spent months after month after month
[7:45] reading what he said to you and to you
[7:49] that how the notes don't you know
[7:51] there's about five or six pages tonight
[7:53] and just don't throw them away because
[7:55] we will probably need them again Sunday
[7:57] cuz I'm sure I won't get through all
[7:59] right it's just it's something to try to
[8:02] get people to see what the Bible is
[8:04] doing the Bible's not written to a
[8:06] sinner the only thing a sinner can do
[8:10] has become knowledgeable of being a
[8:14] sinner
[8:16] it's not written to him because he is in
[8:21] the world of corruption and he's in he's
[8:23] not in you know the position to be able
[8:26] to do he can only hear you need to be
[8:29] saved so you say well two people now
[8:34] know watch this we'll get to it now
[8:36] see people to say well before ever
[8:39] become a Christian I studied the Bible I
[8:41] read the Bible I could memorize the
[8:43] Bible well praise God praise God but
[8:50] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[8:51] you believe right have you got born
[8:56] again since you met and all we went
[8:58] through all it well I've got it all well
[9:02] that's where the Prophet when you get
[9:04] down to it it reading it see he said
[9:08] it's not that kind of knowledge he said
[9:13] it's the knowledge of whether in other
[9:15] words acts 2:38 contrary to Matthew
[9:17] 28:19 or not that's the kind of
[9:20] knowledge we need and knowing that it's
[9:23] not contrary that it is the word let's
[9:26] see that's the kind that we need to do
[9:28] now we'll try to get into the definition
[9:30] of these things as we're going through
[9:33] it but now think about what we've
[9:38] covered the Prophet said how faith and
[9:41] be born again he said the that is your
[9:47] foundation and the whole foundation of
[9:51] Christianity is except on faith in the
[9:57] Word of God all right and see if we
[10:00] can't believe to God to be able to keep
[10:02] his word straight what kind of a God do
[10:05] you have if you can't believe that he
[10:09] can keep it straight without it being
[10:10] contradictory what kind of a guarded are
[10:13] really what kind of a guard you trying
[10:15] to be see are you trying to show how
[10:18] smart you are that you found this you
[10:21] found contradictions and you found these
[10:23] things you know you see just showing how
[10:25] smart you are
[10:26] what are you trying to do be smarter
[10:28] than God then that's your choice I'm
[10:31] just trying to make the point or
[10:33] illustrate it because that's where
[10:35] that's what I've always believed I
[10:37] believe you're born again by faith
[10:41] believing God accepting him as your
[10:45] Savior than him coming back and
[10:47] accepting you and giving you the back
[10:50] - some of the Holy Ghost which is the
[10:52] new birth and the Prophet says then
[10:55] you're born again at faith said then
[10:59] these things these virtues are the
[11:02] things God expects us to add now you
[11:07] said well we can't add nothing well I'm
[11:10] not talking like that I'm trying to get
[11:13] you to see what he's talking about he's
[11:16] not talking about that we've got to have
[11:18] virtuous or with us have it we got to
[11:21] have natural witness will will read will
[11:22] read will read we'll just read ourselves
[11:24] into salvation no you can read it all
[11:27] you want to memorize all you want to
[11:29] it's still no good unless it's made
[11:31] alive unless that word is quickened and
[11:35] made alive it is worth nothing to us
[11:38] except dead letters on a page and what
[11:41] if the Bible say the letter killeth but
[11:46] the Spirit give us life
[11:49] all right and see then as I've always
[11:52] tried to get you to see then to me the
[11:54] you reading the message you hear in the
[11:56] prophet see Peter is trying to tell us
[11:59] how to come to where he is because he's
[12:04] writing about it and he said and the
[12:06] Prophet verified it by saying this is
[12:08] written to Christians those that are
[12:11] born again but then we need a growth
[12:15] development you know we need to keep
[12:21] eating that's like a baby being born
[12:23] it's more that's good but then it needs
[12:26] to eat and that's the way the Christian
[12:29] must do is eat the Word of God until we
[12:33] become the Word of God now what did we
[12:35] try to deal with our basically Sunday of
[12:39] talking about how do you get these
[12:42] virtues if we need them how do we get
[12:46] them well Kalidas I've got where the
[12:49] Prophet said that it's automatically
[12:50] given
[12:59] what do you think about it when he says
[13:04] you've got to grow in grace and
[13:06] knowledge then the Bible says you got to
[13:08] do these things the Bible doesn't say
[13:10] everything just automatically added it
[13:13] will be automatically added if we yield
[13:16] ourselves if we don't yield ourselves to
[13:19] God we will have no growth development
[13:22] that's should be sensible enough for all
[13:24] of us to understand so what do we do
[13:27] make ourself available by studying the
[13:30] Word of God right and as we study the
[13:35] Word of God then God can take that as us
[13:37] trying to say Sunday that we'd say what
[13:40] I need virtue and we have it here you
[13:41] know as I'm eating the word I can't just
[13:46] pick out scriptures and say oh there's
[13:48] one on virtua that's done non-virtual
[13:50] well I got it now I got I got thirty
[13:52] something on virtues know it's eating
[13:56] the word and it's not to say that's what
[14:01] I've emphasized over and over you say
[14:03] well brother Dale you you teach us that
[14:06] the new birth is a revelation what I
[14:09] need a revelation hug that's not for you
[14:13] to try to figure out that's for us to be
[14:16] able to study and let God reveal it to
[14:20] us right it's always been so amazing to
[14:25] me I've tried to explain that you know
[14:27] all the 40 something years that have
[14:30] tried to how that you could be sitting
[14:32] somewhere listening to God you know
[14:35] speaking through some brother in these
[14:36] ministering and and your soul you get
[14:39] locked in with him and doing pretty good
[14:41] with all that once your mind floats off
[14:43] on something else
[14:44] well now floating off might be bad cuz
[14:46] you might be asleep so we tell my dad
[14:48] now well we're talking about that the
[14:51] Holy Spirit can come in and just open up
[14:55] another channel or something over here
[14:57] because that's why I love what the
[14:59] Prophet said do you say brother Dale do
[15:02] you know what you I know what my gift is
[15:04] I know what it is I I know whatever
[15:08] ministers gift is
[15:10] the Prophet talked to you he said it was
[15:14] to break the spell
[15:15] this Satan has over your eyes well I got
[15:21] no spell over mine I believe everything
[15:23] the Prophet said all right that's for
[15:28] you and your problems not mine
[15:31] but just remember now what I'm saying
[15:34] I believe the statue of a perfect man is
[15:37] exactly what it's saying statue means
[15:39] hot growth or development all right and
[15:42] in doing that then it brings us to the
[15:45] divine nature of Almighty God and that
[15:50] wonderful see we didn't know these
[15:53] things back down through time until the
[15:57] Prophet came on the scene it was in the
[15:59] Bible but we didn't we didn't realize
[16:02] what it was speaking or who it was
[16:04] speaking about you realize that's
[16:06] speaking exactly to me and you that's
[16:08] our day that we're right in the world
[16:11] this if I whether I ever attain unto it
[16:15] or anything whatsoever it's there for
[16:17] this age because there's not another age
[16:22] there's not another time so we're in
[16:25] that time of it did not make you happy
[16:27] to realize that God is speaking to us
[16:31] and opening to us the word and as we
[16:34] knew didn't what did the Prophet say he
[16:37] said the Holy Ghost is sitting in your
[16:38] soul waiting on you to bring him the
[16:41] word well how does that do faith cometh
[16:44] by hearing hearing by the word right all
[16:46] right and you bring the word to him and
[16:48] said he'll make it alive as quick as you
[16:50] bring it in well in that wonderful we'll
[16:55] see that's the part we have to do with
[16:57] it so as we were trying to cover that a
[17:00] tad this read that so you'll read the
[17:02] Prophet one time we'll say you add huh
[17:07] then in a minute he'll say God adds
[17:10] Christmas get it straight I mean what is
[17:14] it as we study the word he reveals the
[17:19] word
[17:21] right and that makes it a part of us
[17:24] okay see it's it's when it's when the
[17:29] word is revealed then there's nothing
[17:31] can take it away because that's what the
[17:33] church is built on the revelation of
[17:35] Jesus Christ so it's not trying to find
[17:38] secret coded mysteries it's just to
[17:44] believe what God's saying right now as
[17:49] we go through these definitions now
[17:51] watch remember you're going to have to
[17:53] listen to the Prophet because our
[17:56] definitions on words might be a little
[18:00] different
[18:03] we'll get to it in a minute where he's
[18:05] talking about virtue he said now that is
[18:08] not to be a just to be a virgin life but
[18:11] yet Webster says that's the definition
[18:17] Webster says that's the definition of
[18:19] virtue it's to be a virgin man woman or
[18:24] a girl you know I'm using that cause
[18:26] prophet used both word all right
[18:29] see then he said not in this case then
[18:34] when we get to temperance it's really
[18:36] gonna jump out
[18:38] bless god I ain't got no temper I got
[18:41] your baptism with the Holy Ghost you
[18:43] can't have the baptism the Holy Ghost
[18:44] and have a temper you are wrong and you
[18:50] won't admit it right your prophet said
[18:57] it he said it's not temperance according
[19:01] to Webster is to stop drinking alcohol
[19:03] you know moonshine liquor the wrong
[19:10] definition for Christianity what you see
[19:18] he said it's that uncontrollable temper
[19:22] oh I got no temper I go well why is your
[19:27] face getting red
[19:30] why are you blushing you've tried to
[19:34] convince me of that or yourself prophet
[19:41] said do we sin he said everyday well a
[19:49] Christian Kate's in now we've got a good
[19:51] definition out of that we got it going
[19:53] round but that's the point I want you to
[19:57] think of now because listen the word
[20:00] Virts you I gave you the definition over
[20:05] the other day it means a moral
[20:08] excellency
[20:09] it means goodness it means righteousness
[20:13] now I like this one because it will come
[20:16] over to what the Prophet gave the
[20:19] definition of virtue being strength
[20:22] what's this one inherit inherit power to
[20:27] produce effect inherit power to produce
[20:35] a fact now you'll see what it means when
[20:37] we come over to it in a minute where the
[20:39] Prophet says virtue is strength
[20:45] it means chaste ISTE every how you
[20:48] pronounce it especially in a girl or a
[20:51] woman it's got that definition but when
[20:54] the Prophet is using it the word it
[20:59] doesn't apply in the statue of a perfect
[21:02] man as to the chastity part of doing
[21:05] like that because it should not now
[21:08] listen that's why I emphasized over and
[21:10] over and over see look look at the point
[21:14] you said Webster said is chastity yeah
[21:20] now that's not the word but chase to see
[21:27] shouldn't have anything to do with it
[21:29] when you're standing here as a
[21:31] born-again Christian right now are we
[21:36] getting straight chase to see should not
[21:39] apply to a born-again Christian
[21:44] raaah we're supposed to be a virgin to
[21:49] God's Word me and women and all let's
[21:56] see then we'll see that some of the
[21:58] words sometimes fall into a wrong
[22:00] English translation of his humanity and
[22:04] giving us the wrong definition let's see
[22:08] the Providence say not in this case like
[22:14] I said this should be no problem
[22:18] people say well I'll tell you what boy
[22:21] I've been born again 40 years but you
[22:23] know about 30 years ago I heard the
[22:24] prophets message not stop drinking that
[22:32] don't fit because I didn't drink to
[22:37] start with and I hung with the guys that
[22:42] did do the drinking I'd haul them in my
[22:44] car back in the old days if they caught
[22:46] you with an in car and you know they get
[22:49] you and I I Drive them over and get the
[22:54] beer and come back and in hypersleep it
[22:57] didn't bother me because I didn't want
[23:01] to drink I didn't have to quit drinking
[23:04] when it came into message I didn't have
[23:07] to quit lying cheating stealing when I
[23:10] come in the message I found a stronger
[23:11] boy you is somewhere you missed the
[23:14] Christianity point down through time
[23:19] okay I get on that I get rough don't
[23:23] know all right now look see Peter then
[23:27] is trying to tell us how to become
[23:29] virtuous Christians virtuous Christians
[23:34] you know having his nature virtuous
[23:41] having the nature of Almighty God
[23:44] dwelling within us by the new birth see
[23:52] then that means you got to have faith is
[23:54] a foundation because that's the only
[23:55] thing that's worth anything
[23:58] all right and think about it if you're
[24:05] born again now perforated I've got these
[24:08] the notes you can have them they catch
[24:10] up they can do alright brother Branham
[24:12] says if you're Christian you don't have
[24:18] to worry about the feathers right you
[24:24] don't have to worry about the feathers
[24:26] if you're Christian now if you're not a
[24:28] Christian what are you going to you'll
[24:31] have problems
[24:32] you're gonna be liked a lot the the crow
[24:36] with the peacock feathers or ever what
[24:38] you call it all right you're gonna be
[24:42] claiming something that you ain't but
[24:46] when you're a Christian see you don't
[24:48] have to worry about the things of God
[24:50] they're expected of us but of course
[24:55] when gently works out it turned out the
[24:57] other way because you know what my mom
[25:00] used to tell us he said you know said a
[25:03] woman can go out here and commit
[25:04] adultery and since he has to wear an a
[25:06] around the RET her neck the rest of her
[25:07] days was that the old man go out and
[25:10] commit adultery all he wanted to and
[25:12] said he's a brother right he's good
[25:16] brother that don't fit to me on the
[25:20] inside okay see I'm trying to tell you
[25:25] you don't listen to what say it I didn't
[25:28] drink I didn't do I didn't smoke I
[25:30] didn't do them things I smoked just a
[25:32] little bit when I was a kid and throwed
[25:33] it away I didn't have no desire for that
[25:35] didn't make me a Christian that was just
[25:38] appointed I didn't have any desire for
[25:39] those things I'm not saying that God
[25:42] kept me from drinking and doing no sign
[25:45] maybe he did to where I could talk about
[25:47] it but I didn't know anything about it
[25:52] yeah but listen he says don't worry
[25:59] about the feathers they will be
[26:02] automatically added now remember what I
[26:07] said there's a difference in that in
[26:08] adding automatically and automatically
[26:10] added
[26:12] automatically adding see God will add to
[26:16] you if will yield ourselves let's see
[26:23] what our problem is we try to go at it
[26:25] in we we like I said we take the point
[26:28] of sin would you know it faith is a new
[26:30] birth well what I need to study what
[26:34] what do I need to do what I need to get
[26:38] a revelation of about to birth the main
[26:42] thing is revelation you in bad shape at
[26:44] that point that's about as good as
[26:45] anything or messed up so you don't have
[26:48] to try to figure it out
[26:52] when they heard on the day of Pentecost
[26:54] the story of Jesus Christ through Peter
[26:58] in 2nd there in acts 2 the things where
[27:02] he's explaining the things that he
[27:04] explains about Christ's coming down and
[27:05] all of the things and brought it right
[27:07] down to it and they said they've become
[27:09] pricked in their heart well read add
[27:16] Peter never said stop drinking stop
[27:20] chewing stop smoking now come on can I
[27:22] quote the Prophet the Prophet said
[27:24] people ask what to do to be saved
[27:26] he said we tell them what they ought not
[27:28] to do he said we don't tell them what
[27:33] they really need to do it's just how
[27:36] faith is be born again just accept Jesus
[27:39] Christ as our Savior that's how simple
[27:41] the new birth is don't try to find a
[27:43] revelation don't worry about it you'll
[27:44] find that why because the Prophet said
[27:47] it would be automatically now listen to
[27:52] my definition and thoughts because I try
[27:55] to express what I believe see until this
[27:58] prophet came and brought us the message
[28:02] of the stature of a perfect man we had
[28:05] no way whatsoever to attain unto any of
[28:09] these things oh we could get a little
[28:12] bit of it a little bit of that we were
[28:13] all but then why did the Prophet say on
[28:15] blasphemous names which is related right
[28:18] straight to statue of perfect man he
[28:19] said a lot of people that's in the
[28:22] statute permit have a portion of these
[28:24] virtues
[28:25] without him being born again you think
[28:28] about you know good neighbors that would
[28:30] just do anything in the world help you
[28:32] do anything give you anything
[28:34] they don't make them a Christian right
[28:41] but you see once you once you receive
[28:45] the new birth
[28:46] now follow what I'm saying because
[28:49] listen to the point now see I emphasize
[28:52] the point that there was no way for us
[28:54] to get it until the Prophet come to tell
[28:57] us because you don't know it we didn't
[29:02] know that we needed these things we
[29:04] didn't know we could read but we didn't
[29:07] know that these were a requirement to be
[29:10] added to the Christian life we thought
[29:14] it was the Christian life and that's the
[29:18] same thing of the people in New Mexico
[29:20] that's the doctrine of it that they
[29:24] think that these virtues and things will
[29:26] eventually bring you to a new birth you
[29:30] can't even start till you born again
[29:32] right see then once you're born again if
[29:42] will yield ourselves we have the message
[29:46] now that's where I love things like this
[29:53] view people wants a little secret thing
[29:55] these is one of my liver secrets I go to
[29:58] the future home and listen to that
[30:01] prophet is he bringing it down and as he
[30:03] brings it down to us no excuse with
[30:07] rapture rapture as he brings it down to
[30:09] us he tells us what this is what that is
[30:11] what did it and he says what
[30:19] that these are the things he has come to
[30:25] tell us I mean did we read the Bible and
[30:34] know anything about the future home are
[30:35] the rapture but then after a while when
[30:39] he comes through the rapture message he
[30:41] lays out a real big nugget and he tells
[30:45] you that there it is
[30:48] it has been spoken he said now let it
[30:54] come to pass you know what I don't
[30:58] believe it it have been a rapture I
[31:00] don't believe there would ever have been
[31:02] a rapture or ever would be a rapture and
[31:05] it not been depended upon the prophets
[31:07] message that's the only way I can find
[31:10] for any of us to get out of here let's
[31:12] do that prophets message look it has
[31:18] been spoken he comes down to getting to
[31:23] those personal point like in the seals
[31:25] when he says I'm not looking for his
[31:29] coming he was looking right at it he
[31:35] could see it come on church then what
[31:40] does he say he says these are the things
[31:43] that he expects you to add when am I
[31:49] gonna get it by studying the prophets
[31:53] message by listening to tapes praying
[31:56] and searching for God to bring it unto
[31:59] us it'll bring these things to us but
[32:03] you see we're still trying to figure it
[32:05] out like I said we've go this away and
[32:08] we go that away when we get to
[32:11] temperance we'll go this way and go that
[32:14] away because see one side will say well
[32:16] I ain't got no temper I think that no
[32:19] plaint no temper in me it's all gone
[32:22] when I got the new birth then the other
[32:23] side says well I have problems or I'll
[32:26] throw booze on how I'm still having
[32:27] problems with it I can't get all this
[32:29] straight now and we're missing in the
[32:32] middle of
[32:32] the road to realize that we are human
[32:40] mortals and that within us there's no
[32:44] ability to try to serve God it's not in
[32:50] us as human mortals oh yeah we have a
[32:53] longing or desired time but yet we let
[32:55] that override but he said these are the
[32:58] things he expects you to add now how are
[33:01] you gonna add you get new birth okay we
[33:05] get faith how are you going to add
[33:07] virtue you can't add it until he brings
[33:15] the message the everything was waiting
[33:19] on this day that prophet said 33 years
[33:26] preaching this message the statue of a
[33:31] perfect man go back in 1950 right along
[33:38] in there and listen to him talking about
[33:41] Christians that are genuine Christians
[33:46] and coming down through there but yet he
[33:50] couldn't tied all together then one day
[33:53] he comes forward and he said on the
[33:55] message I was study you know he said
[33:57] these things came to me this drawing
[34:01] this pyramid see then he saw something
[34:06] well can't we see it yeah but see the
[34:10] thing of it is how do we get the virtues
[34:12] by making ourselves available to the
[34:15] Word of God for the hour that we're
[34:17] living and you ever noticed oh brother
[34:22] honey and well I tell you what old Benny
[34:25] Hinn he's doing man he's gonna say no
[34:27] incident but all them great guys what
[34:30] well I'll tell you what I love and
[34:31] hearing them they just preach real good
[34:36] where's one of them got a message
[34:40] now I quote brother branham and let's
[34:43] get it right Billy Graham he said nobody
[34:45] could preach salvation like Billy Graham
[34:48] now that's his word you want it but you
[34:52] don't want Billy Graham he didn't have a
[34:54] message he had the message of salvation
[34:57] to try to get you to Christ he didn't
[35:02] have the message to take us to a change
[35:04] none of them did Schuler's all of them
[35:10] don't matter what they didn't have a
[35:13] message but now listen I'm making
[35:21] ourselves available now what does he say
[35:29] I'm quoting this coming down he said
[35:32] don't try to add it to your actually
[35:38] borned again don't kind of add it until
[35:43] you're born again see lay your
[35:49] foundation and then with that foundation
[35:52] of incorrectly then you can have virtue
[35:55] to come upon that and we'll get up to
[35:59] the point of where we're at now virtue I
[36:04] hope you understand what I've drove that
[36:07] hollered at screamed at and everything
[36:08] else to get us to see that the prophet
[36:14] of God come to bring the word why should
[36:17] we worry about what everybody else is
[36:19] saying about it that's where it doesn't
[36:21] bother me what any of these brothers are
[36:23] doing now I said it 40 years ago I said
[36:28] they'll come a time when the people will
[36:31] be leaving the message it's own record
[36:35] here I said there'll be a time come when
[36:40] it'll be so deceiving my emphasis was I
[36:44] said back car in our days in the early
[36:47] late 60s early 70s you had people that
[36:51] was arguing
[36:52] with those that was trying to bring out
[36:53] those doctrines and they'd say forget it
[36:56] we don't care we believe the Word of God
[36:59] that he's brought right and what do we
[37:06] do yeah there was people that would
[37:11] argue against it I made the statement
[37:15] then in my point of interest emphasis
[37:18] was this I said they're using the quotes
[37:22] and things against us now but I said one
[37:25] day they'll come and use it into our
[37:26] word against us well you see it now
[37:29] they're saying he's wrong that's saying
[37:32] the Prophet was wrong and I saw that 40
[37:36] years ago I saw this and said it I said
[37:40] the biggest portion of people in this
[37:42] message born-again Christians will die
[37:45] and go by the graves before the rapture
[37:47] comes that's on record for 40 to 50
[37:52] years well because I saw exactly what I
[37:57] see today people don't want to hear what
[38:00] the Prophet said they won't some other
[38:03] way or some thought or something to
[38:05] bypass or what to do what can I do
[38:07] brother Dale like one brother told me
[38:09] one time he walked right up to me and he
[38:11] said okay now you told me that said now
[38:14] you tell me what to do
[38:18] well that's what he told me he said you
[38:22] you're saying that we need to be told
[38:23] what to do now tell me what to do when
[38:29] you see what I had enough him to me was
[38:30] to try to turn around and walk away
[38:34] because he was being sarcastic
[38:42] he was telling me you tell me what to do
[38:45] I can't tell nobody what to do I can
[38:50] tell you what we need to do we need to
[38:53] get born again right now look don't
[39:00] worry about these things just get born
[39:02] again and then the virtues will be added
[39:05] now as I said we take a virtue and
[39:09] there's about not offend forgot how many
[39:12] times virtues mentioned in the Bible
[39:14] with the Prophet is talking about virtue
[39:16] as being strength strength he said he
[39:27] said strength to give virture to the you
[39:31] know out to the people a pice now what a
[39:36] contacted the little woman that touched
[39:40] the hem of His garment come on what
[39:45] contacted her you know I mean you just
[39:49] go along with hey I thank all the school
[39:52] touch everybody and somebody will have
[39:54] it now what something directed her to a
[40:02] reasoning factor of human beings that if
[40:06] she touched him not Peter not Paul James
[40:09] Ernie no poet nerves he not not none of
[40:12] them but if she touched him she'd be
[40:16] healed see something quickened within
[40:19] her just like the man told him I'm a man
[40:24] of authority you don't have to go pray
[40:28] for my son say just beat the world see
[40:32] something had created an atmosphere what
[40:35] was that and you'll understand why the
[40:38] Prophet would use the word strength over
[40:40] the fact of using virginity and he said
[40:45] now it means in this case not to be a
[40:48] virgin but it means in this case power
[40:55] our strength well I always kind of
[41:00] thought I didn't maybe I missed a little
[41:02] of prophet but um I didn't think he was
[41:05] 9 foot tall and could cure the world I
[41:12] thought he was a little man I don't know
[41:14] what size well until like the Lord Jesus
[41:17] Christ
[41:18] was it his my in strength that brought
[41:22] her attention to the fact that if she
[41:25] could just touch him or was it the other
[41:30] definition that we used while ago of
[41:33] moral excellency and things she had
[41:40] heard about the dead being raised the
[41:43] sick being healed she had heard those
[41:47] things right and she says if I could
[41:52] just touch the hem of His garment maybe
[41:57] she heard about somebody else did he
[42:01] told to do this her had it done to that
[42:02] or some healing factor that had took
[42:04] place and she was just saying if I could
[42:07] just reach that heal heal me now listen
[42:14] to the point now it wasn't as much her
[42:17] virginity it was the point of her
[42:22] virtuous life in the basis of watching
[42:25] and seeing what he was and she said if I
[42:30] could just touch him said there's
[42:32] something about that man
[42:35] that man has been out here and I've seen
[42:37] the sick heal the dead raised when Ron
[42:40] said in that message what he said you
[42:42] had to have the virtue in there and he
[42:45] said an a pice for it to go from you to
[42:48] others right what's he sayin he said
[42:54] it's not very much of a virtue virtue
[42:56] being virtuous to the point that said
[42:59] you see them out here being a Christian
[43:01] one day and the next day out living like
[43:03] the devil ain't no sport no virtue in
[43:07] that I don't care how strong they are
[43:11] and how much they can quote how much
[43:13] they can holler I like things like who
[43:18] was it one of the Union you know and
[43:20] they come to him and he said back in
[43:22] that ages and they said the people say
[43:24] he said how could God do this to you
[43:28] said you've got to you you can't even
[43:30] talk you can't pretty
[43:32] he said it's all Jesus he said that's
[43:36] who I'm wanting to see right Jesus but
[43:41] leaving a clean moral virtuous life will
[43:47] bring people to the point of wanting to
[43:50] be like that now is that the definition
[43:54] of where he brought it he said now the
[43:55] the greatest song I ever heard was to be
[43:58] like Jesus when you get on over to
[44:00] brotherly kindness and and godliness but
[44:05] what's he saying in virtue its strength
[44:09] but where was the power was the power in
[44:13] her or in him what was in her wouldn't
[44:18] heal her she wasn't talking about that
[44:23] neither is the prophet talking about it
[44:25] in that form right he put something made
[44:30] her think about it something made her
[44:34] consider that these things have happened
[44:40] and I said about the the soldiers are
[44:42] saying you don't have to come to just
[44:45] speak the word what did Jesus say didn't
[44:48] find those no kind of faith in Israel
[44:50] like that the man had heard but listen
[44:58] why can't we hear and do something about
[45:00] it Nicodemus said he heard he had heard
[45:04] right
[45:05] Nicodemus said we believe that you were
[45:08] a man from God because no man can do
[45:11] these things unless God be with him he
[45:15] it pulls something out and then when the
[45:18] woman touched him it pulled the verse
[45:21] through out of pit out of Jesus he's the
[45:24] one who got weak she didn't get weak she
[45:27] got her healing
[45:29] well he got weak when it done see if he
[45:33] had a pice to let it out his life that
[45:35] he was living what did the Prophet say
[45:40] live me a sermon don't preach me one
[45:46] now if you'll notice I think this is the
[45:48] one that he says it in I'm pretty sure
[45:50] he says that let's most of us out when
[45:53] he's talking about having virtue he said
[45:57] that let's most of us out and I agree it
[46:00] lets most of us out
[46:01] we still got human problems but are you
[46:09] thinking with me what come back
[46:11] sheep everyone said faith alone won't do
[46:14] it faith alone won't take you to the
[46:20] statue of a perfect land and listen I'm
[46:24] saying it the best way I can if we don't
[46:26] get these virtues we are all going to
[46:29] die and go by the grave somebody has got
[46:34] to come to the place that these virtues
[46:36] will be made manifest through them and
[46:39] they won't have to die and we've had 50
[46:43] years see the life that he was living
[46:53] before the people is what brought to
[46:57] them an understanding that there was a
[47:00] power there present in that man that if
[47:05] they could touch that power it would
[47:07] heal them do you remember how I told you
[47:19] many times take one more when they come
[47:24] to me and tried to tell me about I
[47:27] needed to be saved I wouldn't be in
[47:32] sarcastic I was telling the truth
[47:34] I said I live a better life than your
[47:37] Deacon board lives and you're telling me
[47:40] about Christianity they never argued one
[47:44] word because they knew I could produce
[47:47] the goods all right but listen
[47:53] I like it like this now I'm quoting it I
[47:56] was telling unbelief
[47:57] who was it yesterday maybe it wasn't any
[47:59] yeah huh brother branham said one day or
[48:03] I'll say it for myself I'm glad God got
[48:06] a hold of me before the church got me
[48:10] I'm glad God got a hold of me before the
[48:13] church kind of hold up cause at least I
[48:15] could have an opportunity why do you
[48:19] think I preach Church I don't have to
[48:23] preach to go to heaven I preached it my
[48:27] family will have an opportunity I preach
[48:31] that this church will have an
[48:33] opportunity to be able to walk in the
[48:37] light of the hour that we live in that's
[48:40] why I preach you think it's so joy you
[48:43] think it's so a great thing yeah but now
[48:49] listen hey virtue knowledge huh you add
[48:58] knowledge now that don't mean worldly
[49:01] knowledge cause that's foolishness to
[49:04] God now there's a definition we said
[49:09] knowledge what I'll just study the Bible
[49:11] I'll just study the message I'll just
[49:13] read all the time we'll praise God you
[49:15] have a head full now you need the Holy
[49:17] Ghost to quicken intamin see that's why
[49:22] to me it didn't matter to me to be two
[49:24] years coming in this mess before it ever
[49:26] confessed that I had to baptism with the
[49:28] Holy Ghost what I sure wasn't goofing
[49:32] off and lazing around during that time I
[49:34] was reading and praying and studying and
[49:37] trying to to serve God but listen it's
[49:48] not
[49:50] worldly knowledge now you know what he's
[49:53] saying see it's not just to study the
[49:57] word it's not to just the fact that you
[50:01] read the Bible it's whether or not that
[50:04] that you read has been revealed to you
[50:09] right how do you judge he said in other
[50:17] words that knowledge to judge said how
[50:19] do you judge if you've got Christian
[50:26] knowledge with your virtue and your
[50:29] faith now listen to him you judge
[50:34] whether the word is right or wrong I
[50:41] look I think at it like this God is
[50:48] pleased for his children to know his
[50:50] word I believe that I believe it I
[50:54] believe he wants his children to know
[50:58] the letter of the word if nothing else
[51:00] you know I believe that because in doing
[51:04] that it'll give an opportunity to flow
[51:07] from head knowledge or intellectualism
[51:10] or whatever and goes into holy ghost'
[51:13] knowledge but Ron says the whole word is
[51:19] wrote in mysteries and only the
[51:25] knowledge of God can reveal it the whole
[51:32] Bible is written in mysteries only the
[51:37] Holy Ghost can reveal that knowledge
[51:43] what about it
[51:45] that is Burchard knowledge come on these
[51:55] are the things that he expects you to
[51:58] add just keep adding now you're going
[52:02] right down the line just keep adding how
[52:07] do you add it now that's what I was
[52:09] trying to say a minute ago how do you
[52:11] add it by studying it and believing it
[52:14] and believing it to be God's Word he can
[52:16] quicken it unto us or make it allow now
[52:19] it's added because remember what we were
[52:22] talking about if you're born again by
[52:25] faith you remember that
[52:27] message after message you're born again
[52:29] by faith all right virtue is has to be
[52:32] the son material knowledge has to be the
[52:35] same material
[52:37] temperance has to be the same material
[52:39] same material as faith well called faith
[52:45] is the revealed Word of God just keep
[52:48] adding he says now you're going right
[52:53] when you see when you get things that
[52:57] seem to contradict themselves in the
[53:00] Bible you sit down and study it and
[53:03] prayerfully like that and the first
[53:07] thing you know the Holy Spirit begins to
[53:09] move in after a while you see it ties
[53:12] together and there you got it
[53:15] that's knowledge he said let's see we're
[53:22] in the opposite realm of things like
[53:25] I've always told you if you want to see
[53:27] it I'll be glad most of you know all of
[53:29] my books were marked up anyway but if
[53:31] you want to see my book under statute on
[53:33] the daniel 70 weeks there was a lot of
[53:37] questions I don't understand this I'd
[53:42] read it I knew had knowledge what he
[53:44] would say it
[53:45] I said don't understand it I put a
[53:47] question I'd go back that's a book aside
[53:51] read other things go around and pray and
[53:54] know and then maybe a year later too
[53:59] later I'd pick that book up again and
[54:01] I'd read it and I'd take a marker and
[54:04] I'd mark that question mark out now I
[54:10] would not preach it until ever question
[54:14] mark was taken off of those pages
[54:17] I'm not joking young God's honest truth
[54:20] when they were all taken off I felt
[54:23] right that I could speak on it and it
[54:28] stood for almost fifty years I've been
[54:31] tore apart by any of them so I just
[54:34] believe it you know what because I
[54:37] believe that's what he said
[54:42] knowledge not worldly knowledge but it's
[54:47] heavenly knowledge and heavenly
[54:49] knowledge when God is the fountain of
[54:52] all knowledge and God is the word
[54:57] heavenly knowledge you believe the word
[55:00] and you reason anything by the word oh
[55:06] wait a minute now we got a statement
[55:09] there they've got some well we need some
[55:11] understanding and you reason it by the
[55:15] word yeah but my will said don't reason
[55:20] that's where the trouble that we got
[55:21] into this we you know we regard all that
[55:24] stuff but trying to read that that's
[55:26] what Eve done she tried to reason it out
[55:30] well you know the same Bible that tells
[55:34] us not a reason just come and let us
[55:36] reason together
[55:37] now what you're gonna do you're gonna
[55:39] throw which one away no see to try to
[55:45] reason something out by human
[55:46] intelligence is wrong but to wait on God
[55:51] to speak now quote your prophet how long
[55:57] did he say it was and he wouldn't preach
[55:58] on the hill he said he didn't preach it
[56:00] until he's seen it you know come on
[56:04] watch the problem why can't we do okay
[56:09] so that
[56:11] knowledge is to know whether the Bible
[56:13] is contradictory these in holy ghost
[56:23] knowledge heaven-born knowledge will
[56:26] always fit together now let's see if you
[56:32] follow what I'm saying in the statute of
[56:35] perfect man the Prophet said you had
[56:37] faith yeah I mean you add to your faith
[56:39] you don't add faith because it's a birth
[56:40] you add to your faith virtue or
[56:42] knowledge he said now these are all
[56:44] tempered together are glued together
[56:46] stuck together two or three different
[56:48] wordings all right which he said it was
[56:50] the same material
[56:51] well now that can't be different from
[56:56] anywhere else in the word he didn't had
[57:01] knowledge at least it can't be different
[57:03] if it's different it won't work if one
[57:09] God won't match up with Daniel seventy
[57:10] weeks or seventy weeks with one God then
[57:13] and see we don't read what the Prophet
[57:17] said we take what we want he says in the
[57:21] Daniel 70 weeks he said if you don't
[57:23] understand this Daniel Sedin
[57:25] you can't understand the seals of
[57:26] thoughts of pleasure that's his wording
[57:30] you said well well I don't understand
[57:33] what that means you don't understand the
[57:34] seals the plagues of our thunders come
[57:37] on be sensible I mean I know all about
[57:40] sealed I just don't understand it's kind
[57:42] of like it's brother done where we used
[57:45] to go to church he said something about
[57:46] he said now that that that statue of a
[57:51] perfect man that's deep that's deep but
[57:56] he said now that adoption it's simple
[58:00] well it's the same time they're both the
[58:05] same time they're both saying the same
[58:07] time we'll see that was his
[58:09] understanding huh what about it
[58:15] what'd you see let's see if our now
[58:19] what's my point now I'm pulling into
[58:21] something I'll probably have to quit on
[58:22] this but pull
[58:24] to a point to get you to think it's not
[58:27] head knowledge it's holy ghost revealed
[58:32] word right that's the knowledge we're
[58:35] talking about the Holy Ghost revealed
[58:37] word now if the word tells us we've got
[58:42] things how can we argue against it and
[58:48] tell him he's wrong now the difference
[59:02] doesn't mean stop drinking alcohol here
[59:05] either
[59:05] no no tempers doesn't mean alcoholic
[59:09] cure not in this case this is Bible
[59:14] temperance Holy Ghost temperance that's
[59:17] just one of the lusts of the flesh and
[59:19] the Lord's are drinking the things huh
[59:21] but we're talking about Holy Spirit
[59:24] temperance that means how to control
[59:29] your tongue not to be a toddler and a
[59:40] lot of time on that then how to control
[59:45] your temper and fly off every time
[59:48] anybody speaks close to you yeah but
[59:57] brother Dale the Christians not supposed
[59:58] to have any temper
[1:00:00] well I only ask you one question
[1:00:05] Peter said we've got to have temperance
[1:00:09] okay so you know what that means we have
[1:00:13] problem okay now not admitting it we're
[1:00:17] we're we where are we at by not
[1:00:24] admitting it no okay
[1:00:35] temperance how to control your temper
[1:00:38] and I go to blasphemous names and look
[1:00:40] at talent isn't it study that message
[1:00:42] with this he emphasizes it heavier about
[1:00:45] that uncontrollable temper you say you
[1:00:50] have a brother day huh what you're doing
[1:00:52] you telling us it's okay to have a
[1:00:54] temper no no no no I'm telling you we
[1:00:58] got one
[1:00:59] I'm not telling us God is going to allow
[1:01:03] us to have it or no he's wanting to do
[1:01:06] away with it don't go the wrong way with
[1:01:11] me and don't justify you for a prophet
[1:01:16] to say that we sin daily well see that
[1:01:20] that's what people do it right say what
[1:01:22] about you
[1:01:23] well the Prophet said it but what do you
[1:01:27] mean I mean the Prophet says that we
[1:01:34] have a temper what it's okay for me to
[1:01:38] have a temper he didn't say that now
[1:01:43] he's just telling us the straight truth
[1:01:47] right it's great truth as human mortals
[1:01:53] we have problems that's what we're
[1:01:55] supposed to be working on right it's not
[1:01:58] saying it's okay for you to have it
[1:02:03] no no I'm gonna say it this way that
[1:02:06] temperate should have been taken care of
[1:02:07] in the new birth right well yeah
[1:02:18] there's something wrong because now your
[1:02:22] profit is one that's giving you the
[1:02:23] definition not me that he's talking
[1:02:26] about temperates being that problem with
[1:02:29] controlling the temper the other Darrell
[1:02:38] Christian shouldn't have until I agree
[1:02:40] we shouldn't have but do we well I don't
[1:02:53] have no temper I ain't had a temper
[1:02:55] since I got born again let me cross you
[1:02:59] just a little bit with a word and let's
[1:03:01] see where you go
[1:03:04] you think I'm rough it's not rough let's
[1:03:10] just sit down and talk about some of the
[1:03:11] Bible just like we're talking about this
[1:03:14] that your prophet emphatic Allah will
[1:03:17] tell you that you're not supposed to
[1:03:18] have a temper but he'll turn right back
[1:03:22] around and say we as human mortals have
[1:03:24] a temperature
[1:03:24] troubles we have problems we have
[1:03:26] heartaches you know why because we don't
[1:03:29] have these virtues is that sensible
[1:03:34] right now if we come together into the
[1:03:39] point that we can get to Holy Ghost
[1:03:42] temperance then those things will move
[1:03:44] out of the way but until then we're
[1:03:48] going to have problems I don't like that
[1:03:53] but I thought you get get saved it took
[1:03:56] care of everything
[1:03:57] where'd you get that out where did you
[1:04:01] get that from that just never even told
[1:04:03] it that what they taught once saved
[1:04:06] always saved I still had had you sinning
[1:04:12] but listen Church I'm just I'm trying to
[1:04:14] get you to think about some time that we
[1:04:16] think these things a prophet is talking
[1:04:18] about means this away when he's bringing
[1:04:21] it to mean this way and it's coming
[1:04:23] right down and cutting the legs off of
[1:04:24] every one of us I don't care who you are
[1:04:27] who's what the Bible will
[1:04:32] two pieces right but now when I look
[1:04:38] down at you and I see you do something
[1:04:41] and then I start screaming and hollering
[1:04:45] about that I thought their subscription
[1:04:55] er said something to the degree of
[1:04:58] having my own front door swept out real
[1:05:01] good right there's something to that
[1:05:06] right when I get my life right then I
[1:05:09] can say some about somebody else you see
[1:05:13] one brother Dale don't preach on things
[1:05:15] these other preachers fries they get
[1:05:20] higher clothes and readiness that's
[1:05:23] wonderful
[1:05:24] it's part of the Word of God should be
[1:05:26] tall it's dire but that's not what's
[1:05:29] gonna make us in the rapture the
[1:05:31] denominations talk that the Pentecostals
[1:05:35] taught there something you tell me about
[1:05:36] the old days of Pentecost when they
[1:05:39] wouldn't even work that time the women's
[1:05:43] clothes had to be down to certainly
[1:05:45] instance on you start telling me just
[1:05:47] remember I'm 79 years old I can remember
[1:05:51] some of those old days I can remember
[1:05:57] some good old days to always tell you
[1:06:00] about in the Baptist Church there where
[1:06:02] we was going that that right behind the
[1:06:04] church was a cemetery dark is pizza
[1:06:07] night I mean black night women would go
[1:06:11] down one side of that cemetery and there
[1:06:13] men will go down the other side of that
[1:06:14] cemetery and they get after and cry and
[1:06:16] scream out and pray to God for salvation
[1:06:19] for their family sometimes don't talk to
[1:06:27] me about the goody-goody or is that no
[1:06:29] don't tell me how goody-goody you are
[1:06:31] cuz I ain't no goody-goody and you ain't
[1:06:32] either we're all in the same boat right
[1:06:37] you know brother Dale I've never done
[1:06:39] this not never done that praise God that
[1:06:42] don't make you a Christian
[1:06:46] that's supposed to be the after-effects
[1:06:49] of the Christian life within your soul
[1:06:53] all right come on let's go by walk right
[1:06:58] over here Sunday and let's listen to
[1:07:01] this man over here preach about God and
[1:07:02] Jesus and we need to be saved and we
[1:07:05] need to get rid of this and we need to
[1:07:07] get rid of that and we need to bring in
[1:07:08] all their we need to do everything we
[1:07:10] can to save the people come on
[1:07:20] but you see one reason that I don't
[1:07:22] preach what a lot of other preach
[1:07:23] I don't walk where they walk and that's
[1:07:27] not good for me I don't try to be
[1:07:31] something that I'm not I'm just what I
[1:07:33] am I don't try to make you think that
[1:07:39] I'm a great Christian I'm just like you
[1:07:43] and me we're all the same that's what
[1:07:46] caught me with that prophet that a man
[1:07:48] like that that was so close to God until
[1:07:51] a whisper from God was all he needed her
[1:07:54] or whatever it was and it's that close
[1:07:56] but yet he turned around and tell about
[1:07:58] true Christianity is Christ living in
[1:08:02] you it's not you living in and said
[1:08:04] we've seen every day well see what about
[1:08:15] it
[1:08:16] do have any temper
[1:08:28] not because if you caught what I was
[1:08:31] doing
[1:08:32] see if you'll take heavenly knowledge
[1:08:34] now I wish I could get this in line that
[1:08:37] I did years ago in 1970 and I preached
[1:08:43] on it 71 I have two brother mol preached
[1:08:45] on returned 70 I was riding up through
[1:08:48] the mountain going over to brother being
[1:08:50] Howard how do you know where it's had it
[1:08:52] Louie I mean I Blue Ridge here what did
[1:08:54] it Dawsonville going through the
[1:08:57] mountain by myself thinking about these
[1:09:00] things I wish I could get back what was
[1:09:03] speaking to me about how that you've got
[1:09:05] to have this one for you can have that
[1:09:07] one all right now just put in plain
[1:09:14] language see you can't have virtue do
[1:09:17] you have faith first all right you can't
[1:09:21] have knowledge do you have faith and
[1:09:24] virtue yeah but I'll study the message
[1:09:28] breast Cara I'll tell you what I've got
[1:09:30] a I've got a great great thing here I'm
[1:09:33] Way up here I'm in brotherly kindness I
[1:09:35] really love my brothers and like I might
[1:09:37] not having other things well how'd you
[1:09:39] get up simple question right how'd you
[1:09:46] get up there that's as simple as I'm
[1:09:50] making it first is faith that's your
[1:09:53] foundation virtue is strength supplied
[1:09:58] by your faith knowledge will not add to
[1:10:06] brotherly kindness it will add to virtue
[1:10:14] that is mounted upon your faith faith
[1:10:18] virtue knowledge the temperance
[1:10:24] what is it black Fenian I know brother
[1:10:26] Brandon brings it through and he gets
[1:10:28] over to brotherly kindness and I'm
[1:10:31] pretty sure this way we'll get back to
[1:10:32] it but he said see being perfect
[1:10:37] godliness that's right just to that
[1:10:40] he says well we can't be perfect he said
[1:10:44] oh yes we can that is required to be
[1:10:49] perfect but he says now what is it said
[1:10:52] he has to make away see these things you
[1:11:00] say well they're just automatically now
[1:11:03] get the point of automatically you take
[1:11:07] faith and add knowledge well it's just
[1:11:09] automatic you get the point you've got
[1:11:19] to have faith virtue knowledge and each
[1:11:23] one is seeming into the other one are
[1:11:25] sealed in as your prophet used to
[1:11:28] definition then it will come to a final
[1:11:32] sealing of the whole thing but each age
[1:11:34] is sealed in faith virtue knowledge
[1:11:38] temperance patience patience can only be
[1:11:50] cemented or laid upon your temperance
[1:11:56] and temperance can only be laid upon
[1:11:59] your virtue knowledge you know they
[1:12:02] don't knew each one has got to be added
[1:12:04] to the other as you climb upward faith
[1:12:08] virtue knowledge temperance patience we
[1:12:15] can't weaken how places better unsaid
[1:12:17] and blasphemous no he said you come all
[1:12:19] the way and he said unit required to how
[1:12:20] the Holy Ghost yet there's where those
[1:12:22] people talk that message and they're
[1:12:25] still teaching it since these are the
[1:12:27] Prophet says you ain't got the Holy
[1:12:28] Ghost you get up here to brotherly
[1:12:30] kindness or something that ain't what he
[1:12:33] saying he's talking about perfection he
[1:12:38] said you come all this way before God
[1:12:41] requires for you to be perfect I love
[1:12:43] that you know what cause if he required
[1:12:46] for me to be perfect and I'm gonna say
[1:12:47] it whether you like it or not if he
[1:12:49] requires me and you to be perfect
[1:12:53] then it's got to come faith virtue
[1:12:55] knowledge temperance patience that's the
[1:13:01] only way it can come right come on
[1:13:09] what is patience brother Brennan are you
[1:13:16] talking about patience he said first one
[1:13:20] is to have patience with God now there's
[1:13:23] where we all fail that's where I fail
[1:13:25] that because I asked him and I ain't
[1:13:27] mean in the worldly things or something
[1:13:29] but when I asked him for something then
[1:13:31] you don't give it to me it tries my
[1:13:34] patience they don't you know I just
[1:13:39] score it tries mine until he makes a
[1:13:41] little more secure and then when it gets
[1:13:43] a little more secure and he starts
[1:13:45] talking to me then it'll start to where
[1:13:47] I can start thinking about the real
[1:13:50] truth have patience with one another but
[1:13:55] around said 33 years now we'll say this
[1:14:02] so that's what I said you think what you
[1:14:03] want to about what I saved it you can't
[1:14:06] argue about it cut 40 years ago I said
[1:14:08] this that the Lord spoke to me one day I
[1:14:12] believe it was him and said if you
[1:14:13] wanted patience since you gotta have
[1:14:15] patience for the people well I tried I
[1:14:26] failed but I've tried okay I'll try to
[1:14:30] have patience wanting to see you desire
[1:14:35] the word to have a joy in the Word of
[1:14:39] God to rejoice in God's Word that's what
[1:14:49] I'm saying that's what I want you to do
[1:14:50] I want you to have it to a point that
[1:14:55] you can out patience because that's what
[1:14:58] I need is patience but remember the
[1:15:05] patience has got to come towards the
[1:15:07] position it comes on each one is C
[1:15:11] minute on top of the other
[1:15:13] you can't just slide it in and and do
[1:15:15] what you won't do with it it has to be
[1:15:18] brought one after the other as the
[1:15:21] Prophet said are automatically added
[1:15:24] okay what about God trying your patience
[1:15:35] God tries them I love the statement
[1:15:43] let's see what is it where he says it
[1:15:45] this bride will prove that she will not
[1:15:47] fall like I fell right she'll prove it
[1:15:54] he's gonna make her prove it I know I've
[1:15:57] tried to explain this and a lot of
[1:15:59] people wonder but I've always tried to
[1:16:01] explain it in this away that you take
[1:16:05] back there in the Old Testament there's
[1:16:07] two prophets - prophet two scriptures
[1:16:11] one says if a prophet gives you a sign
[1:16:14] and it come to pass you better believe
[1:16:16] it
[1:16:17] another one says if the prophet gives
[1:16:20] you a sign and it comes to Pais and he
[1:16:22] takes you to another guard
[1:16:23] you better not believe it you got two
[1:16:26] things well I believe the Prophet well
[1:16:32] which one of the prophets you're going
[1:16:33] to believe now the Bible says you said
[1:16:40] would God allow prophets to come among
[1:16:43] us and be false in time the Bible says
[1:16:47] that he does that to try FA our patience
[1:16:55] he puts trouble right in front of us to
[1:16:59] see what we'll do right the Bible said
[1:17:06] even if that prophet gives you a sign
[1:17:08] and it comes to Pais don't hear him
[1:17:13] watch it because I am trying you
[1:17:22] none of us wants trouble we don't ask
[1:17:24] for trouble don't worry about it
[1:17:26] now we're about asking for trouble
[1:17:27] you're just stupid to think you can do
[1:17:28] anything with it go don't ask for
[1:17:30] trouble that's coming automatic that's
[1:17:33] one thing I do believe in they come in
[1:17:34] automatically trouble everybody else's
[1:17:37] taxes and what is it in death and taxes
[1:17:42] ain't worried about neither one of them
[1:17:45] look this you mean God would send a
[1:17:52] prophet and have the sign and it come to
[1:17:58] pies now let's illustrate somebody comes
[1:18:07] in here to preach and he said brother
[1:18:09] Dale said you left me to be open us your
[1:18:12] this Sunday you just be open and and do
[1:18:14] whatever you know you get up here and
[1:18:17] he'd say now I'm gonna pray in a little
[1:18:23] bit and said of gods they're gonna roll
[1:18:25] for caskets right in here there's gonna
[1:18:29] be a dead person in each one huh I said
[1:18:33] I'm gonna get up and say one thing y'all
[1:18:34] gonna be raised in the day it now what
[1:18:39] you gonna do
[1:18:45] cause the scripture says if it comes to
[1:18:51] pies to believe them right and we're
[1:18:55] still in the Bible that if it comes to
[1:18:59] pies I'd float to believe it you know
[1:19:02] the Urim Dunham if the life flashes in
[1:19:04] the thing you're supposed to believe it
[1:19:11] but what are you gonna do you know what
[1:19:18] I'm gonna do I'm gonna ask you to say
[1:19:19] well brother what do you preach say well
[1:19:25] I tell you what I'm a little country I
[1:19:27] guess do y'all hear because I don't
[1:19:29] believe rotor Branham was a prophet
[1:19:30] because I am the roll the caskets out
[1:19:35] let the dead walk we ain't got nothing
[1:19:37] to do with it get out of here you mean
[1:19:40] you'd be that way yeah cause these off
[1:19:44] the word the God is going to try and is
[1:19:52] trying the people in this message and
[1:19:54] you see them now falling this all across
[1:19:57] the land its ministers and things that's
[1:19:59] been in the message 20 30 40 50 years
[1:20:02] and you see them just falling away right
[1:20:08] no signs and wonders you don't hear
[1:20:10] nothing you don't hear that a man went
[1:20:12] off up yonder and they had signs and
[1:20:14] wonders and and and they were 15 people
[1:20:16] healed and they're you know you're
[1:20:18] nothing like that
[1:20:19] you did hear people go off the Bible
[1:20:27] said if he take you to another God don't
[1:20:30] hear him now what's another God brother
[1:20:37] branham wouldn't a prophet in this life
[1:20:39] dead brother so enjoy that's another God
[1:20:41] you just got another garden running with
[1:20:44] it
[1:20:44] you understand and God is going to
[1:20:47] permit that to happen well you're making
[1:20:56] guard to be some kind of no I'm making
[1:20:58] what the Bible says he is like anyhow
[1:21:05] patience
[1:21:06] I like the way brother Branham described
[1:21:07] it he said there Moses words have said
[1:21:10] he had patience you remember isn't said
[1:21:13] he throwed that rod down as it become a
[1:21:16] snake he said to him other guys come
[1:21:19] over and they flip down their rods and
[1:21:20] said they become snakes and said o Moses
[1:21:24] was looking around you know then he
[1:21:29] never got excited he just waited and
[1:21:33] said just about that time glutton Moses
[1:21:36] snake ate up the others well what if he
[1:21:41] just took off running see see Flay row
[1:21:47] had no way called Pharaoh knew one thing
[1:21:50] let's see did he use the word cheap
[1:21:53] magician's trick or something like that
[1:21:54] kind of no brother branham used it
[1:21:56] I don't know words to direct written in
[1:21:58] the Bible chief magicians true
[1:22:00] anyhow he said that's just a trick said
[1:22:02] here thrown down he could do every thing
[1:22:09] that Moses could do but I love this one
[1:22:16] he could bring things but he couldn't
[1:22:19] take him away go read your Bible he
[1:22:25] could bring play road couldn't bring him
[1:22:28] but he couldn't take them away because
[1:22:33] that's definitely a different ministry
[1:22:37] can't be impersonated what about a
[1:22:41] church do you see what I'm getting
[1:22:46] building it higher and higher and higher
[1:22:48] and higher then we come to godliness
[1:22:53] they've gotten this to be added what is
[1:22:57] God in this mean he said he looked it up
[1:22:59] many dicks energy finally found one said
[1:23:01] godliness means to be like God to be
[1:23:08] like God
[1:23:16] what is godliness true godliness to be
[1:23:20] like God but be careful how you use that
[1:23:26] because that's Satan's approach also he
[1:23:31] wants to be asked God right is that the
[1:23:35] Bible say it wants to use that to me as
[1:23:38] God how what is it about being like God
[1:23:41] that would be to have God's faith God's
[1:23:52] virtue God's knowledge God's temperance
[1:23:56] and God's patience and that'll be like
[1:24:01] God right when random doesn't use the
[1:24:07] great definitions of being like God if
[1:24:10] you'll notice one thing in there is
[1:24:11] you're reading it I gave you the run off
[1:24:14] to you that have it I gave you the run
[1:24:16] off to occur and you basically through
[1:24:17] but if you'll notice one thing that
[1:24:19] always stuck with me that brother
[1:24:21] branham uses spends a lot of time
[1:24:23] emphasizing faith virtue knowledge and
[1:24:26] temperance he starts in temperance
[1:24:28] slowing down I don't mean that wrong but
[1:24:31] see he doesn't put in there a lot about
[1:24:33] he puts a good bit about patience then
[1:24:35] all at once then godliness he just said
[1:24:37] this to be like God he covered a few
[1:24:39] scriptures and go wrong because he's
[1:24:43] getting up to the place now where God
[1:24:46] can trust you double you got God to have
[1:24:50] God's faith virtue knowledge temperance
[1:24:52] patience and godliness to be like God
[1:24:58] alright then what does he say charity
[1:25:00] only give two or three paragraphs in the
[1:25:03] book that he speaks of charity and
[1:25:05] telling us about the dollar bill and it
[1:25:07] every things and showing how it was
[1:25:09] charity and all are doing you understand
[1:25:14] the further you go up the pyramid unless
[1:25:16] you gonna have to be propped up you
[1:25:19] don't have to prop it up you don't have
[1:25:20] to do this you want to do that you just
[1:25:22] have to believe it go on brotherly
[1:25:26] kindness
[1:25:28] you come to brotherly kindness and you
[1:25:30] say well I need brotherly kindness and
[1:25:33] what was his definition
[1:25:34] he said now brother maybe die and he
[1:25:41] said maybe you had a little problem and
[1:25:44] you didn't get around to making things
[1:25:46] right and said the brother paysanne he
[1:25:51] said you you really wanted to be able to
[1:25:53] go and talk to him right and get
[1:25:55] everything right brotherly kindness
[1:25:59] right brotherly kindness hoping someday
[1:26:11] and this is what I was doing going
[1:26:13] across the road and feel listen then put
[1:26:19] see brotherly kindness see see hoping
[1:26:26] someday see patient with him see
[1:26:31] temperate enduring with him knowledge to
[1:26:36] understand what he believes remember
[1:26:43] it's in his heart now you listen to what
[1:26:50] I'm saying here the only way you could
[1:26:51] ever come to this one to have some
[1:26:52] godliness that's what it is virtue in
[1:26:56] yourself to let it out with kindness
[1:26:59] meekness to him having faith that
[1:27:02] someday God will bring him in the
[1:27:05] brotherly kindness brotherly kindness
[1:27:14] can we have God's patience with one
[1:27:16] another and how brotherly kindness you
[1:27:22] know some of you around here at shook
[1:27:24] hands with a with some of the other
[1:27:26] people in 10 years probably
[1:27:33] oh you meddling now well is it true I
[1:27:43] mean do we do we love one another I went
[1:27:53] to preach to the church one time telling
[1:27:54] some other the other day and I came out
[1:27:58] and I stood my wife and brother Gary
[1:28:00] Atkinson sister Rebecca and they were
[1:28:03] standing out to her sister I mean huh
[1:28:06] Margaret for the Geary's first while
[1:28:09] they were standing out there and I
[1:28:11] walked outside the church and I said uh
[1:28:13] hey yeah there's all over here and
[1:28:18] everybody else is over there
[1:28:19] I don't remember I said something to him
[1:28:20] they said we've been standing here the
[1:28:22] whole time
[1:28:22] I said nobody ain't come by and shook
[1:28:24] hands I said that ain't no problem I
[1:28:27] said I just got through preaching the
[1:28:28] sermon ain't nobody shook my hand yet
[1:28:32] didn't you call it brotherly kindness
[1:28:37] right just think about these things they
[1:28:44] asked me or they asked Louise is not in
[1:28:46] here F guess he doesn't know by what
[1:28:48] they ask him something the other day
[1:28:50] some people did he's telling us out
[1:28:51] there the other day and they've asked
[1:28:53] him kind of how brother Dale would and
[1:28:54] he said well brother Dale's right out
[1:28:55] there with the people and you'll notice
[1:28:59] if you'll stay around long enough I'll
[1:29:00] shake your lane
[1:29:01] I don't care phase 100 here or 500 I'm
[1:29:06] gonna shake your hand if I can I
[1:29:07] preached for a man one time walked out
[1:29:11] of the church and I was looking for him
[1:29:13] well forget it I didn't come here for
[1:29:15] him I just started cuz I knew all of his
[1:29:18] people I had preached our before word

[1:29:25] he says we're wondering where you that I
[1:29:27] said oh my you were the people well
[1:29:29] according to my understanding if you get
[1:29:30] to see him you got to pick out a certain
[1:29:32] number and he's you know you gotta have
[1:29:34] a ABC code to go through the Deacons and
[1:29:37] then that code can get to him you know
[1:29:39] the Deacon can cuz you ain't gonna talk
[1:29:41] to him well I can't do that ain't none
[1:29:44] of my business what he does but I can't
[1:29:46] do
[1:29:47] that I'm gonna shake your hand I want
[1:29:50] you to know I tell you those brothers I
[1:29:53] know I've got in trouble with this way
[1:29:55] could tell you about it
[1:29:56] he we've been places and and I'd walk up
[1:29:58] to pastors and preaching and say brother
[1:30:00] I Love You Man they've done you eat it
[1:30:03] and when I got into a bad guy here he's
[1:30:05] a little gay or something you know
[1:30:08] you know but you're gonna shake my hand
[1:30:17] and if I know you've got something
[1:30:19] against me and you're upset with me you
[1:30:23] gonna shake my hand
[1:30:27] cuz that's one thing I've got is a
[1:30:30] little bit of brotherly kindness yeah
[1:30:32] maybe a little bit okay let's go five
[1:30:36] more minutes brotherly kindness then you
[1:30:38] come to charity all right we can come to
[1:30:41] a lot of things about charity but I
[1:30:43] wanted to make one emphasis on to the
[1:30:45] last and then we'll pick up something
[1:30:48] about this Sunday of the Lord with it
[1:30:51] but I want you to think about one thing
[1:30:56] when you're looking at the pyramid and
[1:30:58] the things and you're seeing it says
[1:31:01] Holy Spirit right here and then it says
[1:31:04] love we all know that's the Holy Ghost
[1:31:07] all the way up and down but this is what
[1:31:10] I like what the prophets say it off the
[1:31:14] Statue of a perfect man
[1:31:16] paragraph 323 328 excuse me they can
[1:31:20] pull it up if they want to us the life's
[1:31:21] 113 all right now what does this do then
[1:31:26] you're waiting for the headstone which
[1:31:27] is love for god is love and he controls
[1:31:31] and he's the strength of every one of
[1:31:32] these things that's right yes sir
[1:31:35] thanks tell about the headstone which is
[1:31:39] love right down below that is the Holy
[1:31:42] Spirit now listen to it right in here
[1:31:46] right in here you see I got in between
[1:31:48] all these works in here here these
[1:31:54] little waves come what is that the Holy
[1:31:58] Ghost coming down through
[1:32:00] privacy the holy spirit the holy spirit
[1:32:04] is above all this welding it together
[1:32:06] building a what a perfect Church for the
[1:32:11] capstone to cap it off
[1:32:15] he put Holy Spirit in the right place
[1:32:20] because that's the one that seals it all
[1:32:22] together you want the headstone
[1:32:24] that stone can't come till we get all
[1:32:26] these virtues all right can't get out of
[1:32:30] here do we get these virtues okay these
[1:32:34] virtues are the nature of Almighty God
[1:32:37] each virtue is God's nature and each one
[1:32:41] is I've tried to cover is to be added
[1:32:43] one own to top of the other
[1:32:46] not just fling them out and you pick up
[1:32:47] what you want it's got to come the way
[1:32:51] God gives it and that's why he's been so
[1:32:54] patient with us waiting 50 years since
[1:33:01] the going of the profit waiting on us
[1:33:09] where he can add these things there's
[1:33:14] things in there that you and I cannot do
[1:33:16] and be so he has to add them to us but
[1:33:20] once he adds it to you it's yours
[1:33:22] you remember that now it's yours God
[1:33:26] give it to you when God gives you faith
[1:33:30] puts virtue on it knowledge given it's
[1:33:33] building the stature of a perfect man
[1:33:37] with his nature his makeup and bringing
[1:33:48] an individual to the place that we can
[1:33:54] walk off this earth one day come on
[1:33:55] musician think on these things I wanted
[1:34:01] to emphasize the virtues in a group like
[1:34:04] than to talk about it because some of
[1:34:07] those things don't seem to fit to human
[1:34:09] terminologies of what we're doing but it
[1:34:12] fits what the Prophet was do
[1:34:13] or what he was saying so it don't make
[1:34:17] no difference about us then it ain't up
[1:34:20] to us may I say one more time yeah
[1:34:27] how could of mankind ever received the
[1:34:30] statue of a perfect man if Peter had not
[1:34:32] preached it how could it be attained
[1:34:37] into in the end time until the Prophet
[1:34:40] come and brought the message the God has
[1:34:51] waited on you and I adoption he said to
[1:35:00] word that he could come and Phillips
[1:35:02] whatever fiber of our being take us in
[1:35:04] the rapture well I I just can't see
[1:35:06] brother Dale that ever happen within
[1:35:08] you're an unbeliever the best way to say
[1:35:12] it you know I'm believer coach prophet
[1:35:13] said it right I mean you could offend it
[1:35:17] at me know won't you get offended at him
[1:35:19] you know say brother Adam you shouldn't
[1:35:22] have said that about me no you know but
[1:35:25] her dad don't you see we try to use it
[1:35:29] to justify our own thoughts what we got
[1:35:31] brother let Stan thank own these things
[1:35:34] these virtues must be a part of our
[1:35:37] being and God has given us the
[1:35:41] opportunity
