but he loves us and he loves his people and we in turn what love him back good to be in the house of the Lord good to be back thank you all for um hanging in there this past weekend with brother Bob we sure enjoyed being at brother Martin's it was a um it was a pleasure to be there we met some really nice people people and we had a real good time brother Louise um did a good job preaching for us let me get this where y'all can see it for us older folks better getting there getting there that's 391 per. that's about the best we can do all right let's let's let's just read that with that so by way of announcements uh remember Brother Anderson he's been watch that or we've been Marco Polo and each other and they're enjoying watching the services and they enjoy being in the Homeland or the or the Home Country there Sarah and David they're they're kind of happy to be around Grandma's there you know so let's just keep them in prayer they're about 6 hours ahead of us so the time difference is a little it's in the afternoon there and they're uh they're watching us I'm sure online so we appreciate them and we will we we really will appreciate them getting back amen miss them part of the body amen part of the body also we had a wonderful Bible Study last night we're going to cover some things today that that we had talked about Wednesday night that we covered in the Bible study I had several questions one of the questions was about the horse forehead and we're going to try to and it's and it does have something to do with godliness and being closer to God are are being further away from God all right so um and we had we got a few more questions that that we didn't get to uh we appreciate your attendance we appreciate you coming it's uh it's just a wonderful time when you can sit down a couple hours and you can talk about somebody has a question on the heart you can you can talk about that and and Converse back and forth but we'll talk about that in just a minute uh remember this afternoon after the second service we'll have cake and ice cream for my birthday will be tomorrow tomorrow as brother Ryan says communion will be next Sunday not this Sunday because of that Father's Day weekend will be Saturday September the 7 September June the 17th and we'll give you more information a little bit later Saturday the 24th will be a prayer meeting at 7:00 because the next weekend or the July 1st and second weekend will be our annual um meeting anniversary meeting uh brother juul for will be here Saturday and brother Mike Alig will be here Sunday only be one service on Sunday and I'll get back with you on the time for July the 1st I got to talk to brother juel hav been able to get in touch with him also remember downstairs July 14 15th 16th if you're going to go with us you need to put your name down so we can start getting rooms all right and also brother Aaron's gone today but he'll be preaching on Wednesday night so let's just keep these things in prayer let's uh let's bow our heads dear Lord thank you for the day that You' give us it's Sunday it's Resurrection morning Father may they be as brother John said a renewing of our mind a true Resurrection a resurrection of the truth in our hearts and Lord let it not be that we're conformed to this world but that we're that we're renewed Lord by your mind coming into us and us being a part of you as we our worshippers We Worship You Lord today we worship you in song now we're going to worship you in word and deed as the Bible tells us father be with the ones that are sick sister Freda and different ones sister Johnny Sister Mary different ones that are not here we pray that you'd be with them and give them strength father we'd love to see them here in service and Lord I know they want to be here too so I pray that you'd raise them up father for your honor and glory Lord and help them with their situations Lord I pray that you'd be with us now in the furtherment of this service forgive us of our sins give us a blessing today that we cannot contain in Jesus name we pray amen that's part 109 we're still on the son of man but we're on godliness and then we'll talk a little bit on brotherly kind uh brotherly kindness because brotherly kindness is going to be a little uh maybe a little lengthy and a little touchy on certain some things but that's okay that's the last one right before we get to to the the Holy Ghost ghost sealing Us in all right so we want that that's what we want we want to come to the Statue of perfect man we don't want to just have this as as a meeting today and we just going to meet and we did our duty and we're going to get done with the service and go to the house all right you're wasting your time if you do that Amen in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth second Peter 1 that's where we've been with our thought and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and the virtue of knowledge now remember we're going to get back to that when we go to that interval part look at that word add add to your faith faith is not an ad you're adding to your faith all right so you're adding to your faith all right and to knowledge Temperance to Virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and brotherly kindness charity and it continues on it says if these things be in you abound it'll make you that you'll be what prosperous as brother John was talking about the natural part it does meld with the spiritual part uh there there's if you have chaos in your life then you probably got a little chaos in your spiritual life hello somebody amen all right so you may be seated the Lord as his Blessing to the reading of the word and we'll get into that just a little bit because we were talking last night about the about the horse forehead and it's kind of a strong word to use but it's in the Bible all right is everybody with me it's in Jeremiah we'll read it in just a little bit but I kind of went over at Wednesday night and and if you if you weren't here Wednesday night I would appreciate if you'd listen to that one again because it really did help me and some of you said it really helped you uh that were here uh to know what godliness is godliness is something that we put like on this great huge tall mountain and we can't get there we ain't good enough you ain't good enough I ain't good enough you know we went through our whole life you ain't good enough and then if you try to tell talk to somebody that's the first thing they said you ain't perfect and I ain't perfect well we know that but we can live closer to God than the world I hope we're supposed to be in the world but not of this world all right so that's come to a place and two there was a there was a little question last night we were talking about babies and I want to cover that and just too because it does help us in all this of going up the statue of perfect man you you got to be born again and you got to know that you're born again you got to know the difference in being born again and being saved all right 1 Timothy 3:16 Says look without controversy so when we talk at the toward the end of this you're going to see the mystery of godliness where is it it's a mystery to the world but it's not a mystery to me and you amen we know where to find godliness it's in the true Bible the true word of God and in the message of the hour if you'll live it through the word of God not just say I'm a message believer I don't cut my hair I don't smoke I don't okay so without controversy great is the mystery of godliness why because the people in the world are going to say you can't be like God and I can't be like God all right but the mystery is that we can and God told us he'd be with us in John 177 he didn't tell he didn't tell us he'd take us out of the world he'd tell us how to live in the world all right as we were talking last night you can't you can't not rub shoulders with the world you can't put yourself in a bubble you can't put yourself on a mountain somewhere and and be a prepper and think you can live off of uh your own self and but that makes me Godly no it doesn't make you Godly there another word for that but without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest In the Flesh now we know this talking about Jesus but who else is talking about me and you yes me and you can do this justified in the spirit seen of angels preaching to the Gentiles believed on in the world received up into Glory you know that's exactly what we're doing now we're preaching to the Gentiles believed on in this world and we're going to be received up Glory we're going in a Rapture amen this is the whole part of this that we're looking at we're going to take a rapture yes as we were talking about last night all right so that word is is Strife or dispute or or quarrel so without controversy without any quarreling we're going to talk about today the how to get Godly and do it without being some you know Superman cape and and all that stuff that you got to put on all right remember Superman did have a weakness all right at Kryptonite well our weaknesses is sin but we will prevail because we're not Superman all right we're God man with a Superman in us all right so this Plan of Redemption that we we were kind of touching on last night and I'll tell you some of the things that we were talking about we've talking about babies going to heaven and and come to the age of accountability and will they go into Rapture and I kind of thought I would go over it just a little bit more um got a call uh that was still questioning a little bit but last night we were talking about if you take a child and say junor and I have a child and and it doesn't come to the age of accountability it can't be it's covered under this great Plan of Redemption okay all right but we've got to see categories in that great Plan of Redemption everybody with me all right you can be saved and not born again but you can't be born born again and not be saved all right one more time all right you can be saved and not born again two different words but you can't be born again and not be saved you got to come through that process of salvation but saved does not put you in a Rapture saved will not put you in a Rapture saved will not put you in Bride the only way you can be bride and come up in the first resurrection is to be born again in your soul before you die some of these people can be saved under the Plan of Redemption pass away but they and be given eternal life but they're not bride they're not coming up in the in the first resurrection and they'll not live in a new city but they'll be saved because the Bible says believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved okay there are millions and billions of people that get saved everybody with me but now to continue on as that you got the Baptist say once saved always saved well brother Brown he didn't believe that neither do I but I do believe once Born Again always born again all right you can lose see that's where people you can lose your salvation but you can't lose listen you can't lose that new birth in your soul right you can be saved today and you continue on and you go back doing the same thing you were doing before don't work like Brother Don said don't work you didn't go on to just to sanctification you didn't go on to the indwelling of the Holy Ghost but now this all covered under the Plan of Redemption so if a baby dies before the age of accountability you could consider them saved because they're saved under the blood of Jesus Christ CH all right and they're giv eternal life they're not born again everybody with me all right they're not bride they're not going to live in a new city sorry it's just that's what I was telling them I want my kids not just saved I want them filled with the Holy Ghost I want them doing things in church I want God to bless them as bride not just barely get them by by the Skin of Their Teeth but you know what I'll take that amen I'll take that that means I'll get to see them for an eternity all right but the Bible says you'll be there with your offsprings in the Millennium that means somewhere down the line they got to get the new birth not just a deathbed confession which that is saved everybody okay with that does everybody understand that's kind of what we were talking about last night but you can be saved and not be born again but you can't be born again and not be saved because the saved part starts you on your journey yes all right now if you're saved and God listen this is all left up to God we were talking about last night brother Brown said God's infinite omnicient I'm the present he knows everything so before you get here he's going to know that you're just going to come to Salvation and and then you you know it's not just like we were talking about last night you don't just get this good feeling or or or or get caught find Jesus in jail then when you get out you leave him in the jail housee amen seen it seen it hundreds of times I've seen it stick but I've seen that now listen if they if they're truly repentant and saved if they die somewhere quickly there it's got to be left up to God but they will not go into Rapture and they're not considered born again and they're not in the sixth Dimension all right so this PL great Plan of Redemption is that where everybody's covered under a Redemption plan we've been talking about about the Plan of Redemption for a long time everyone is covered under that now whether you accept it or not is your business okay but now the Bible tells us when we come to the knowledge of the truth there's no more sacrifice for that all right when you come to the knowledge of the truth you sit in this church and say well I'm saved I'm going to heaven I'd be careful you've been taught different you've been taught to go through the three stages you've been taught that you the cuts off your past sins and puts you what in line to be born again but you're not born again yet all right but God Knows by for knowledge according to Romans 8 according to Romans 8 according to everything else God knows who's going to make it up statue of perfect man therefore he puts it there puts you in a place to get it that's what we were talking about last night you got to remember he has to put you God's obligated to get you here yes sir you're not you have no choice we talked about this a couple sunds ago you have no choice to get here but God got you here through permissive will through your parents and and the other question last night was and somebody asked brother Ram about illegitimate children could they be saved in other words could they go into Rapture well we just kind of broke it down again and and um you take this over here and you see that that when we look at I bastard children in the Old Testament that was so hideous the prophet said the Bible says four generations a 10 Generations 400 years so brother R said great great great great great great he named a bunch of great grandkids couldn't go to church because of that one act of adultery or fornication or living together before you're married and producing a child that child under the blood of bulls and goats he had to bear that or she had to bear that burden of what their mother and father did now me and you uhuh we're on this side of Calvary the blood of Jesus Christ I don't care if you come to the age of accountability you give your heart to God you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul you're just as Eternal as God is God doesn't hold that against you he can't cuz he can't remember it so praise God don't worry if my Mom and Daddy was count the years back and make sure they were married you you know I have to be careful sometimes when you say I've born so many years and you look at your kids and your kids are twice you know two years older than that you go so but it makes you think you know because you know what we're humans that's the first thing we think we go something happened well you know what it wasn't the kid's fault never fault the kid God doesn't fault the kid that's right now when that kid comes to the age of accountability and he gets up 12 13 14 years old and he looks back and says well I can't make it because I'm a bastor child no no no he's been taught wrong you tell him or her they have just as much opportunity as I do and you do that were born under holy wedlock to make it as anybody else all right is everybody with me that ought to settled a lot of it for for for a lot of people cuz they're all covered under the planet of ber iion God knew that yes sir he knew that for whom he did for o he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren Mor over whom he did what predestinate them he called yes sir and whom he called them he justified and whom he justified them he also glorified the call for John Wesley was was to live a Sanctified life a little bit higher than Martin Luther all right then the Pentecostals come along and they are required are predestinated to stay in the plan of God you have to be predestinated to that plan but it's by choice he saw your choice you saw what you would need he saw today what you would need you would need a certain word and that's what we're going to talk about uh maybe this evening we'll talk about that as good seed going into the good ground we talked about a little bit last night CU what is the seed the seed is the word of God today you came to receive the seed word of God now what you do with it is your business if it come from God I'm telling you if this came from God today it's going to strike your ground your Earth and then what you do with it is going to determine how good it's going to be for you tomorrow and the next day and the next day everybody with me all right didn't the Bible tell us the Bible tells us how Dreadful it is to be in this place the house of God it's for correction but for me when I come I want Deliverance I want to know what I did wrong and I want somebody to expound on it so that I can quit doing what I was doing before is that not what you're here for all right we ain't come to that kind of perfection yet but we're getting there brother BR talks about the basis of free moral agency you can turn it down or accept it so I'm not going to have to read these quotes over again I've read them three or four times we believe that you have a choice yes in what you're doing today you have a choice all right buy a free moral agency and as we were talking about last night moral you see that word moral we just kind of say free moral agency moral is the morality te and then we're going to talk about a horse forehead in just a minute brother John we I'll expound on a little bit more from last night cuz sometimes you do you throw out that word and it's kind of a harsh word and and but there's a meaning behind it go if the Bible says it I'm going to be able to say it well another words I didn't make that word up brother Bri didn't make the word up the word was in the Bible already and Jeremiah was talking about a country or a a a nation called Israel but guess remember what though you and I are spiritual Israel so we have to take the the good and the bad from the Old Testament see the Old Testament was given to tell you give you to condemn you remember brother BR said get you in the pawn shot but couldn't get you out Grace is what got you out of the pawn shop coming over to the New Testament and the blood of Jesus Christ but it didn't take away you being your free moral agency it didn't take that away you're still free morally you're the agent or agency to decide yes and no as brother John was talking about yet you know you listen to God's Nos and you better listen to them them's the best yeses you'll ever get if he says no see remember God's infinite he knows that if he lets you go down that path what will happen to you before you think brother John this is the best job this is what I need to do this is where I need to go I need to live in this $500,000 house this $150,000 house and you know what God will just let you go if you don't re if you really just want to go you just push your way right through it and it'll be a disaster all right I love what brother John's bringing because it molds Christianity and your and your natural life because the Bible tells us here in Peter that this stature of a perfect man is pertaining to life and godliness we'll read that in just a minute your life and godliness all right so we're it's attached you can't like we were talking about last night uh you know the Bible says you know like flee from this and and from such turn away that doesn't mean that if if you you know if you work in a group of heathens and there are all bunch of heathens and they curse and drink and smoke and you're the only Christian in the group well I'm going to quit this job cuz I you know the Lord told no God may have put you in that job to show them that Christianity can be lived amen so you stay there pray to God to give you another one if you want to but if he keeps you there as we were talking about dad last night and the several brothers that were here brother collie and different ones that worked at General Motors with him 1,200 1500 people heathens they were having church service and they didn't walk out of the church service being bless God I'm taking an extra 10 minutes for the Lord right no they stayed under the law of humanity the law of what that um establishment said you get a 15minute break now they didn't take 30 and say well them 15 we shouldn't do that no see they would have lost uh and I'm going to say this cuz I'm going to say something when we get to the end of the service you when you come to some and you you're you're held to a position uh brother Dale was held to a position brother him brother Mo him and brother Mo were kind of held to a position that they were ministers and they were bringing this gospel and they were the 15 minutes instead of eating their lunch they were having church service now what if what if though they were held to this people would see that what if they were held to this and then when they walked out in the parking lot there was brother Dale and brother Mo sit on the back of a truck drinking Budweisers and smoking cigarettes now that never happened you know well those of you on the internet that didn't never happen I'm just saying what if you're held to this position you have a position everybody's going to be watching you and the devil for sure is going to watch you through people to make you try to fall or to lose your testimony but when you keep seeing day after day after day you living just a normal life but it's different it it's it's Christianity the way it's supposed to be not some not some emotion or not some um you know and I'll read it in just a minute we'll talk about the horse forehead and it really fits with today all right that was written by Jeremiah some 4,000 and something years ago but it's for today yes cuz I'll read what it is I I know some of you don't know what it is but I'm going to read it to you and it'll tell you pretty much what Jeremiah Was talk or God was doing talking about through Jeremiah brother M says in time of decision I really like this because this takes care of you saying well I can't be any other way but this God's going to pull me through a tube God's going to he's predetermined that this is what I do brother Braham said now you got to make up your mind you've got to make a choice and this may be your last time to make a choice now he's given an altar call all right he's giving an altar call but it's working today same as it did back then and this may be your last time to make a choice excuse me tomorrow may be too late God might have ch you now look God chose everybody to eternal life God would that all be saved amen we know he just died for the bride we know he just died for certain people but but before that Jesus knew he was there for a purpose and only a certain group of people would have it but God the Father even from the Old Testament all down he said hey I'll give eternal life to whoever wants it all right believe in my son believing in Jesus Christ God might God might have chose you to eternal life now you think man if God chose me to eternal life I'm some of this great something and I'm bride and I'm this and I'm that God might have chose you to eternal life but if you don't make up your mind and accept it somebody else will take your place amen somebody else will take your place that's kind of a wow quote there wow somebody else will take your place yeah I can see that cuz God's going to move on if you don't want to move with him you're here he's keep he's going he's going to find somebody come on people he's going to find somebody that'll worship him right he's going to find somebody that says that ain't nothing but the truth every word of God is right that's what we're talking about when we talk about godliness it's not something that we live sinless Perfection there's no way you can do that prophet of God tells us he said this this thing will be sticky until the change you still got that nature you got to deal with that you were born in the world with memories and conscious effects and Imagination but the Bible tells us in Philippians through Paul that you may be what blameless and harmless we blame oursel every day when we going to get to see though that God doesn't hold that the same way we hold it the sons of God without rebuke in the midst in other words let me rephrase that in the midst of rubbing shoulders with the world are a perverse Nation among whom you shine as lights in the world that's why Genesis 17 when he talking about Abram Abram was 99 years old the Lord appeared to Abram he wasn't even Abraham yet and he said I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou complete be th thou perfect in other words Abraham do what I ask you to do and he did right so look that means one who lacks nothing in physical strength or beauty sound or wholesomeness complete look morally innocent try that in the end time and having Integrity like I said before if you got a position that's why I always say if you got a position in this church you should be at every meeting you should be at every function you why because people are looking at you and if you're not there and you're supposed to be on this position right here and you're not there you lose all credibility all credibility so if you don't want that position you can give it to somebody else just simple as that all right one who is morally and ethically pure now watch this we looked at the how we going to get this we're going to get it through through the five-fold ministry we're going to get it through preaching we're going to get it through the Bible tells us in Ephesians the perfecting of the Saints All Of Us Together which means completely Furnishing not making you a god zombie as I was talking about the other night it's not something that you know you got you're this robot you're this artificial intelligence and it's just all God we're coming to that we will be that when we get on the other side but we're on this side today we're still dealing with the born in sin part the the shaping in iniquity part everybody with me but we're going to realize one day that that's got to come out of us and overtake that part that Mom and Daddy brought here who's our worst enemy yourself I am my worst enemy so don't blame others blame yourself right second Peter 1 says according as he divine power this is where we've been reading on statute of perfect man he's given unto us all things that look pertain unto life and godliness so it's your life that you live as brother John's you know molding that into your life um with finances and all that then uh you know we should check up financially in our in our financial world and in our spiritual world all right and we should learn listen we should learn to sleep well on Saturday night so that you don't sleep well on Sunday morning I'm sorry I'm boring I'm I'm not Dynamic if you want to find somebody that's that you just bring them on and we'll we'll just we'll pump you up but you know what it's going to happen when they leave you're just going to go back to what you were unless you decide to change unless you decide to hang on every word like it's the last sermon you'll ever hear and I need that to get to heaven then you'll then you'll keep yourself awake it is hot up here though Aaron's not here to regulate the the U the Heat or the cool part but this whole thing pertains to life and godliness so we're not just coming in here and say well just going to be the godliest people in the world listen if you'll live like that let God live through you like that amen but don't try to do it yourself don't try to stick peacock Fe I mean yeah peacock feathers and and if you're still a buzzard that's right and have y'all seen as many buzzards I don't know I must be I must be you know my mail route it's like going through herds of them and you're trying to you know they're in there's 20 of them on the road and and they're eating one little bless their heart one little squirrel that died and they're all trying to eat him you know and there's 20 of them and when you drive up I hit one the other day I hit his tail but have you ever seen that many you know they're fixing to eat all these people it's going to die I guess I don't know where by are given unto us exceeded they're ugly too great and precious promises that by what these promises that we're talking about today you might be partakers of the divine nature now listen that's our goal is partake of the divine nature of God not our own nature listen if you're used and good and yourself is just really good you need a new birth you need to be born again and besides this giving all diligence add and we got to Godliness here we'll get to this real quick godliness means what reverence respect piety towards God now remember we're going to talk about horse forehead but stop just a second you can't find that in the world today people are so irreverent unrespectful and they just think God's whatever he wants to be LGB or t you know I mean he's and and put him in a pull pit and that's what we're going to talk about a horse forehead because God saw that that that's what would happen in the end time it's just now it's just now where where even they have no respect for ministers used to you know you'd have a little bit of respect for ministers and I mean you I don't go around like Brother D says you know uh preachers that used to you know say oh bless God I'm a preacher put me where they don't smoke you know I you don't do that but but now they just say whatever they want to around you used to you know they wouldn't they wouldn't curse if it's around daddy or anything like that you know when we go to places to hunt and all but after the last couple of years they just slip right back in listen you're going to be who you are you are going today this day is manifesting time you've got to you can't hide it for years it's going to come out today today you're going to prove who you are amen if if you believe that then you need to look at yourself and say am I just saved or am I Born Again so we get back to the point we were talking about last night brother Ms look if you got genuine Faith then put genuine virtue to it knowledge Temperance now he says genuine you're moving right on up the line all right fifthly add godliness oh my godliness to be added what does godliness mean okay looks in several dictionaries and it means to what to be like God all right pretty simple but now look he said after you get Faith got faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience then be like God all right you say I can't do that brother brandham all right everybody believe brother Bram was a prophet everybody believe that what he said we're supposed to do right he is the final Authority the final voice of the final age we are but it's under our Prophet messenger and what he said about us and to us right he said oh yes you can abely amen oh yes you can he didn't stumble around they said I can't do it brother brandom oh yes you can you can't do it oh yes you can you got to want to then he's talkinging about a few scriptures reading all the virtue all the things that in God is in you all right be therefore p r f c is that perfect in other words complete all right you get way up here before you're asked to do it though God is mindful of all of us that when we're babies we're babies when we're babies we can't handle stuff like we did before all right see some of you kids running around outside and I'm like man you know give them about five or six years and they won't be doing that give them about 20 years and they sure won't be doing that all right but a baby's a baby though but that baby's going to grow up yes sir and when that baby grows up the attitude needs to change naturally and spiritually all these things has to be added first so brother M is giv us the total prescription of what to do then when you get up here he's asked you now to be perfect godliness Sons and Daughters of God how many things you could say on that so let's go back to what we're talking about without controversy so when we start talking about this godliness there's no controversy well I can't but no there's not well I can't but the prophet of God said yes you can sir it's just whether you want to bad enough or not because all that live Godly in Christ what will suffer persecution right that's what we're heading to that's what kill Jesus they didn't kill him for his good works they killed him because he said he was godone right yes ain't that what they told him we don't kill you for that we love your healing programs we love your your Ware programs where you can take five fishes or two loaves and five fishes and or vice versa and and feed 10,000 people we love that but don't tell us you're God and that's the same thing today because you get that same thing you ain't perfect I ain't perfect everything is kind of molded and meshed together in this age all right but you and I are told to stand above that everybody with me all right First Corinthians 11:32 says but when we are judged this is what the scripture we read for communion but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord now watch here's your separation that we should not be condemned with the world all right Paul's telling them said you need to do this and when you're chastened of the Lord through a five-fold Ministry through a prophet messenger tapes and books every how you want to do it that we should not be condemned with the world because we know the world is condemned the cosmos the world order now he didn't say take us out of it he just said he separate us where we won't be condemned with the world all right in other words we've been instructed on how to do it and we read that list on Wednesday night and I'm gonna read it again because when we come to Godliness we can't again we can't look at our faults we can't look at our failures we can't look at the things that that that that sometimes you can't help the things you do cuz you're I I could I could try to be quiet like Sister Barbara and it'd kill me but Don it wasn't that funny it's pretty funny okay it would be a disaster if I tried to be quiet as Sister Barbara bless her heart or car she was trying to get to church bless her heart it's good to see all y'all back again y'all too and uh but but I just can't that ain't me God didn't make everybody to be quiet I thought Lenny a said he said why do you somebody asked said why do you sing he said I sing for those who can and those who can't God's given me the gift the same for those who can't and for those who can so I kind of like that that all right but you got to take that apart though and say hey now God used this so let's look at some of these a list of things now listen the world is condemned all right you with me just just a few minutes the world is condemned we're supposed to be not condemned with the world right so now we look at the world but now we we look at the world now as the world looks at the world it's okay for women to wear pants and it's okay now for even to wear them in a sanctuary it's okay for a woman to stand up in a pull pit and preach with a pair of pants on with hair short as mine that is Christianity to the world that's condemnation that will not be fruitful oh it may be in natural things they they may preach prosperity and and you know everybody's going to get money if you do this or send me some first though yeah yeah but we're away from that we know that we've been taught that that's not it that's right so we sisters don't cut our hair because the Bible tells us that it's an Abomination brother brandham even comes and he expounds and says if you cut your hair sisters your husband has a right to put you away for dishonoring your head and that's what the Bible says actually it wasn't it brother brandham said it the Bible said it first you dishonor your head if you cut your hair now look so now what does that do that separates about 1% of us that don't to the 99% that do and and they're covered under their Christianity all right but we're not going to be condemned with that if we don't do it amen amen right right and you know whether you've cut your hair or not so but that'll be your condemnation because you will be condemned with the world the Bible says it's an Abomination to put on a garment pertaining to man now we are we good here all right if you don't do that then guess what you've moved over to this Godly side and removed yourself from this ungodly side because the Bible says it's an Abomination to God to put on a pair of pants is everybody with me so you so you've taken yourself and put yourself in the godliness part all right hairdress actions manner of life I hope and pray uh and I know there's some are not here today but you've got these big groups and big programs in different churches for divorcees hang on I'm not going to bash anybody don't get nervous about marriage and divorce I'm going to make a point but it's common to them it's common to not work out your problems go ahead and get a divorce cuz maybe you're already fooling around with somebody anyway hello somebody all right now I hope we're not worrying about that in this church Hallelujah I hope that we don't have to have a Planned Parenthood or a singles group where they teach you how to worship and love God in a divorced condition now listen if you're divorced listen I'm not I'm telling you this is what they do over here and they call it godliness they call it helping people because they got people in our congregation that's fighting and fussing and committing adultery and XYZ and they day you can't get their stuff worked together and they're just going to divorce well let's go back to the Bible only one way a woman can divorce there is no way a woman can divorce a man no way unless he's dead and that's not a divorce that's dying and marrying again so we've been instructed then how to come over into this godliness group and not be covered in this condemned group right everybody with me so see now godliness now I believe we're living it I think I think what we're doing is we're living it but we don't think we are everybody with me we're expecting this great I don't have any bad thoughts not going to happen but if you see the condemnation of the world and you read the Bible it says to not do this and if you're doing it you're condemned that's right if you're not doing it you're not you've come out of that that's right come out of what her that church that denomination that whes forehead and listen we don't need an Alcoholics Anonymous program in this church we don't need a smokers Anonymous in this church we don't need a Gamblers Anonymous in this church but some Churches do sad to say amen that's Christianity to them right we don't believe in AA we believe in Deliverance absolutely cuz AA tells you once an alcoholic always an alcoholic no you get born again you will never be an alcoholic again that part of you is gone sir but see the world can't they can't think the way you think so that puts us in that godliness group everybody okay with that yeah I I think it's something that's insurmountable so much that when we say godliness we think I can't never do that brother Brown said what yes you can if you'll go about it the right way all right so let's look at this horse forehead real quick and then we'll close right here we won't get too far we can finish a little bit more of it tonight or this afternoon all right listen this is a strong word and I know we got young kids in here but it's what the Bible says because as we were talking about last night you got you got to remember we're going to look at this word it's a little bit different than a prostitute because a prostitute charges a is just a loose woman or a man well get quiet but you need to explain that to your kids if you don't hadn't already because the Bible tells us that in Jeremiah therefore the showers have been withholden look the showers what is it former and latter rain former rain teacher rain latter rain is Harvest rain it's talking spirit in other words I am withholding your blessings because you're doing this right here Israel You're My Children you're my wife but I'm fixing to divorce you cuz you have a horse forehead you have went and committed adultery with someone else and there hath been no latter of rain and thou Hast a whse forehead right here thou refuses to be ashamed bless God it don't matter what I wear to church bless God it doesn't matter how much I cut my hair bless God it doesn't matter how much I drink God just loves me anyway he does love you but he loves his word more than he loves you because that's who he is you can't he can't love you like you think he loves you and go against his word can't do that therefore the showers have been withhold and there ha been no light or rain thou Hast a horse forehead thou refuses to be ashamed now last night we were talking about I want you when you when you think about that word what do you think about a loose woman or a loose man someone that can't control theirself someone that's that's um uh sexually promiscuous okay everybody with me all right look at this definition the definition of that word in the Hebrew lexican is highly fed and therefore wanting highly fed I'll raise it up so y'all can see it above the piano highly fed and therefore wanting in other words can't control their self wants to eat all the time has to be partaking of something all the time and wanting with it in other words there's no barrier whatever goes and that's what they're doing in churches now whatever goes that's what it is if it's a trend that's what we're doing that's why the Methodist church thank God there are some and I believe God will stand for those people that stand for what they believe and keep those women and LGBT out of the pull pit but now there is a group that says not we're pulling away and that's what we're fine God God's good God loves everybody yeah we going to find that out when he when he becomes a just God at the white Throne judgment you going to find out how loving you think God is all right so strongs means highly fed and therefore wanting it also does to mean to commit fornication or be a harlot because remember you got to look in the Book of Revelations where there's what there's a mother and there's daughters are harlots that's the hor forehead but watch to be unfaithful to be unfaithful Jeremiah says you become Unfaithful Israel but the whole problem is they don't care they don't mind they have no conscience of right and wrong oh actually they don't have no conscience of wrong a't that what today is people have no conscience of wrong that's why they'll kill8 and 10 20 people that's why there'll be mass shooting that's why the the husband will kill the wife and and vice versa y'all see the other day that really nice she's some kind of self-help person or does something and and she was bragging on her kid and bragging on her husband they got her in jail now for killing her husband poisoned him watch out but see that's what the world's got to watch out see the world has got to watch out for that because that's the mentality of the world right we don't have that mentality I hope Zach don't have to look at his food and make sure this and Lily walks out the door but you understand that's what the world that's what they always got that worry you should never have that worry if you're worried about stuff like that you need to get born again so now the forehead means the brow or what right here what's Expos right here in other words you're Forward Thinking so you're wanting you you eat a lot you can't control yourself and everybody can see it let's look now brother R didn't say anything about a horse forehead he just made a he just read the scripture but I looked online and uh some several commentaries and and excuse me for reading them they're not from brother brandham they're from and I didn't put the guy's name down because it doesn't matter cuz I feel by the Holy Spirit I looked at it through my filter and it seems like it was right all right this is used in the Bible as an analogy for a person group the nation of Israel in Jeremiah's case are a church who has broken all meaning of integrity so severely they no longer recognize the damage or the evil of their actions it doesn't matter what the Bible says about pants I'm going to wear them anyway oh that's Old Testament stuff well let's talk about the New Testament stuff The Cutting of the hair the drinking the smoking the cussing um not coming to church I mean people in the world now I was talking to one girl she said well we can't have seconds we we quit having seconds service I said because of Co you should know because people quit coming about true here maybe you get enough first time I don't know a church who has broken now church is a what a body but you make up that body all right they no longer recognize the damage or the evil of the action and that same way with all of us oh that's all right I can just do this because all right it is a relevant term today describing how the average person's sense of wri and wrong has been warped right from what is natural is that not this world this has led to the destruction of marriage massive numbers of fatherless homes and bastard births 30% to Upward of 80% illegitimacy rate in some group wow they just don't care anymore you know when I was growing up if if the girl if a girl had was got pregnant before she got married they hauled her off she got I mean she was gone all right just say it now it's just everybody just you married no but we yeah we're good no it's not it God didn't ever make a provision for that it's still wrong but we have accepted it and there's a lot of things that sister Trudy um callings we were talking about last night a lot of this we can't throw to the m to the out there in the denominations anymore it's here it's things we accept and we let things get by that we usually would not have let get by before open and increasing sexual perversion homosexuality pedophilia transvestites beastality pornography adultery prostitution and the sexualization of young children especially girls all right these passages all have a similar context they were written just prior to the fall and scattering of either Israel to the North or Judah to the South each shows a wealthy people that not us a wealthy people unblinkingly focused on their pleasure giving no thought to God they are casually uninterested in the moral where well welfare of their nation that is crashing into utter depravity shame for sin has disappeared and that's exactly the truth shame for S it's no shame to sin anymore you know why cuz Satan said well it's all right everybody else does it I mean how can you read the Bible even even our our precious neighbor down lives besid Daddy and him he said how can you read the Bible and let something like that in your pull pit he's talking about the LGBT cuz he's a Methodist how could you do that it's still written in the Bible in every translation it stayed the same it's an Abomination but they have accepted it that's right but they'll be condemned with the world we are not condemned with the world because of our godliness cuz we're acting closer to God than anybody on the face of this Earth cuz we've been taught right the interpreter's commentary of the Bible states that the Bible shows that in the period before these nations fa think about this nation ready to fall their society show significant breakdown in two areas political and business leadership and family life with specific blame falling on women all right in these passages the following characteristics are either directly named or strongly implied watch look Rebellion obstinacy betrayal distrust shamelessness and greed comprising an audacious self centeredness against God and fellow man now that didn't talk about brotherly kindness does it all right these are not the characteristics of a nation that would bring honor to God that's not a characteriz a characteristic that bring to this nation Amen to honor God at one time in in the history of this nation the overwhelming majority of people expressed a strong sense of Shame when they sin can't you remember that am strong sense of Shame and sorrowfulness and repentance they ain't got to repent for anything now they put everything that was listed to be repented of over here they put it over here as it's all right to do amen so that's the horse forehead that's what that means it's it's you have come to a place where you don't care if your neighbor knows your or you your daddy knows you a or anybody know they don't care I'm a I'm Mist I'm Baptist I'm Presbyterian I'm bromite overwhelming majority of people Express a strong sense of Shame when they sin it's in other words don't away with sin was an ugly thing and due to this sense of Shame they did whatever they could to hide their moral flaws from others now they don't but he said some of that still exist the period of 1950s and early 60s however was probably the beginning of the end of that attitude sin was gradually carried less of a stigma and the sense of Shame has been slowly replaced by a growing boldness of attitude a flaunting of sin now have we come to that much of that sense of Shame has disappeared from the American psyche some remains in a small percentage hello some remains there's some Grace yes and a small percentage of the population yet increasingly bold immorality has become the way of life so that sin is now blatantly committed because it's all lumped over here you can go to church and do all these things right here and you're fine no God godliness brings you out over here and teaches you that you can live Godly in Christ but you're going to suffer persecution from this group as it gets exceedingly bigger right used to it might have been equal now it's heaped over on this side because we just let it go that's why you can't get perfected by that's in play you got to have somebody stand in front of you and tell you what you doing wrong you got to have somebody to preach the gospel to you to perfect you away from this group over here amen you got to have that you know why cuz God saw that's the only way we would get it and really get it civility is becoming a thing of the past rudess and open Brazen misconduct is becoming the normal way of doing things that's right this is the kind of conduct of horse forehead pictures it represents the blatant audacious sin of the street walker who is out in public openly displaying what she is in other words walking through Walmart with her well most nothing on in Walmart openly displaying what she is promoting herself yes not ashamed and tempting others to engage with her the horse forehead represents obdurate practice of sin done overtly with no attempt to camouflage this attitude is reminiscent of the story of righteous lot dealing with the homosexuals in Sodom just before God dropped the fire and brimstone on the people of that B City so that's what a horse forehead is it is blatantly saying hey Lord I it doesn't matter what the Bible says this is what my denomination says this is what my teacher says this is what my whatever this is this is what I think right this is what I think no it's What God Says and that's it that's the whole thing it's what God says we're going to put it at that and leave it at that you love the Lord yes sir so we're talking about life and godliness we're talking about uh we'll get to deity this afternoon because listen the only way you can live this Godly life is that something Godly must be inside of you can't do it yourself because you are that group over here you've been called out of that group you ought to be happy that God at least called you whether you come out your business but if you live Godly you will suffer persecution we'll read that this afternoon you love the Lord amen I want to talk to you for just a minute on a couple of things just to um try to get my notes together here now I appreciate everybody in this building all right I do and it's because of a lot of you most of you I've come to be I believe closer to God all right because God puts people and I'm not talking about bad people I'm talking about put people in your life to help you all right and then when whatever happened to to brother Dale that we we see that he's not been preaching all right so I have been given the opportunity to not take over but to assist in trying to help all of us as a group and individually okay and and and I'm not here for a vote of doing a good job or a bad job CU I know I've done a bad job but I want to ask you a question as long as I stand in this pull pit there's certain things that I like to do right I like to have special meetings I think they're valuable I think that if we don't we become so inclusive that we have no Fellowship okay so that's why I have and I'm sorry if I strain your you know your lifestyle that's why I've tried to have special meetings at least maybe once a month twice a month or for sure have something for the Youth and I believe it's work um someone came to me one time a year or so ago and said well we're having too many of them all right of course it wasn't a kid was an older person so I we decide now to do it every other the third Saturday of every other month and I announced this and it's it's there I don't announce it 15 minutes before the service starts right I try to announce it three months or two months before we have any kind of special meeting and sometimes longer than that everybody with me all right now when I go to a church another church like say brother Joe Green he's got uh always the first week in August he's had camp meeting 50 years and it's always the first there there's and and every person in his church is there cuz they know that's a special meeting they know it's there to let our light shine or their light shine and we we're recipients of that because a lot of us have went some of you have not and that's okay like I said I'm not here to beat anybody now I just want us to be aware that as long as we have special meetings I would like for y'all to be here okay two weeks ago we had a f we had a meeting with the youth all right I announced it two months in advance that we were going to have extra people here and we did a bunch of y'all decided not to show up Saturday my wife hobbling on one leg did about 90% of the work and my poor old 80y old mama did the other part and sister Esther helped some I don't mean that bad I just mean they came in later knowing we had a special meeting knowing we had and I was telling you weeks in advance we were going to have more people at that than we'd ever had in any kind of Youth service and that we needed some help and a bunch of y'all decided to go somewhere else I don't like that you shouldn't have done that and not just my wife and my poor Mama but that was a disservice to the people that he because you know what happened some of the visitors helped Saturday some of the visitors helped serve the people that doesn't show good so if you're not going to back if you're not going to back this church up all right the you need to tell somebody I don't want to do that on Saturday I'm not going to be here ever and then we can decide I'll hire somebody to help us but shame on you for saying you're part of this church and then you just run off and disappear and it didn't just happen two weeks ago we've had special meetings before and people decide to go somewhere else now like I said before I I'm not mad at anybody I'm just upset that we don't think enough of what we're doing in this church to be a part of it okay and as I said before if you have a named position in this church as long as I'm standing right here you have if you have a named position in this church you need to be at every special meeting you need to be at every church service that you can I know there certain times I'm talking about just BL ly not being here Bible study if you don't want that position you need to let me know or brother Dale know or brother Terence know that you don't want that position anymore if you're not going to hold that position to an honorable place so that people look and say well where's where's I don't know they're off you know at a basketball game or something okay position if you don't want it just tell somebody I I don't want to do that I I in other words I can't be here every first Saturday of every month for Bible study I'll find somebody take you place that will and like I said it's not it's not something that I you know but it is it's it's the way I feel I feel this and if you don't like it you can come to me and tell me but this is the way I feel that this church should be the most important thing at the time that we have meetings and at the time that them doors are open do you mind if I tell you what brother Brown said about opening the doors of a church listen I know vacation folks vacation is only once or twice a year I'm talking about all the time you go on vacation yeah vacation what you get about two three weeks I know some of y'all are retired but you know what I do the same thing now when I go to Illinois you know what I do I go during the week so that I don't miss a weekend I go during the week I take my own time off I ain't beating nobody's drunk brother Dale same way we go somewhere and he say find us a church we're going to church even on a Wednesday night find us a church I we'd find one somewhere or we'd go somewhere we' drive two hours to go to church when went to Kansas all right Richard was with or some it's your desire though and you know what I believe God blesses that desire but I believe also you come over into this group when you dishonor God I don't want to be in this group I don't be like the normal I want to be like God God's going to show up whether you do or not but he you know what he's going to do though he's going to show up in somebody that's how he's going to get here sure he likes to be here but listen God is not effective not in people you think about that God's always tied to somebody you're praying for somebody and God comes on the scene you're praying for somebody and God comes on the scene you're studying for a sermon and God comes on the scene and says hey say this I'm going to read something this afternoon where brother Rand on spoken words Original Seed the Holy Spirit told him to pick up his pen and write do you know what he wrote probably half the people even in this message don't believe it and it was written by the Holy Ghost he said the Holy Ghost pick said pick the pen up are we following the false prophet are we following false teaching here I hope not please say something if we are but we ought to show it by supporting and backing up everything that goes on in this church because I'm telling you like I said before all the special meetings I've ever been to everybody in the congregation that I know are there because they know it's a special meeting and they know that people need help and we like to serve the people I like to be a servant I actually did Saturday I served the people did I not we took out trash and all the different things we did do and that's okay you know what I don't mind it I'm not somebody brother Dale's never been that way and I appreciate that he's never been somebody that sits back over here on his big old throne with his wife and said bless God y'all I'm the pastor y'all do all the work no he jumps in before y'all do that's a servant's heart and you know what that's an example that I try to live by so we need to what practice what we preach okay so just just be mindful like I said before I'm not I'm not sing I'm not singling any one person out I'm just throwing it out look that's the way I want us to be from now now on if you're not going to be here for a special meeting you need to tell look I'm not going to be here all right I I don't believe in them I know some of y'all don't that's why you weren't here Saturday but that's a youth service whether you got youth or not I didn't have any youth here and I was here cuz I wanted to hear from God and you know what I wanted to do I wanted to see our youth do something for God I'd rather listen I'd rather see the youth do something for God than you cuz we're older we should be established we're Christians but maybe they're struggling maybe they're having a hard time maybe they're in that transition period of teenagers where they need more support than ever before and then you got you got the group like Jonas and different ones that are and and Thomas that are heading toward that uh teen years it's right rough and like I said before look what the world has given them that's right I just read you that whse forehead is out there in the school in the churches in families we're trying to get them out of that and put them over here where they can look and say oh that church supports youth we're going to go there just say let's stand to our feet I learn I learned this from Brother Dale he used to do this before the service started it you could tell everybody's head was cut off and they didn't even listen to what he said so I thought well today I'll do it afterwards and then you can chew on it at lunch you can throw you can throw your maters and ters at me if you want to and that's fine cuz that's what I'm having for lunch is tomatoes and I mean maters and and U carrots so been trying to lose a little weight but listen it's it's pencil sharpening time for all of us we need to step our game up because you know what God wants us that's what that is that's stepping up our game game that's not just being a numb Christian oh it's okay whatever no it's a fight it's a fight and we'll look at it this afternoon in Matthew 13 way I'd never seen that before about the seed and where it fell into because remember you look at some of those scenarios and it looks like he's talking about people of the world no the Bible says that that group of people is the children of the Kingdom that's me and you and there things that happen in our life that we need to get rid of Amen let's bow our heads dear heavenly father if there's anyone that needs to be prayed for or has a need father I pray that you'd just touch them where they're sitting we pray father that what we said have been pleasing to you Lord we been uh running it over in our head and trying to get your thoughts not mine to help each one of us not to hurt anyone Lord I pray that you would be with us as a church I feel that we're trying to do the best we can at the time Lord I pray that you'd be with each person that has a position we're going to talk a little bit that tonight when we come to Godliness and brotherly kindness we need to know who we are we need to know our position and as we were talking about last night brother Brown said when the bride realizes who she is and also her position what's going to happen she'll be an invincible Army because we know we'll know who we are and we're only going to know who we are by the foolishness of preaching you we're going to have to all hear the word we got to all come up to the Statue of perfect man we've got to all come to the unity of the faith we've got to all come to this full stature of Christ so that the headstone can come back on the church and then we will be a Powerhouse just for a moment thank God you sent us a prophet to tell us just for a moment even in the darkest time just for a moment God's going to speak through his church one more time and then we're going to be taken off the Earth and then the wrath of God will be poured out on this whole entire Earth but praise God we'll be gone we'll be gone in the twinkling of an eye we'll be in another dimension and and nuclear power is not going to hurt us there nothing's going to hurt us no harm we'll have no sickness no disease we'll be Eternal Father I pray that you give us a piece of that while we're here let us see that you're working in each of our life Lord Lord and the things we do father forgive us of our sins and our mistakes that we make Lord just be with us as we go with a natural meal and come back today this afternoon Lord I pray that you be with the ones that are watching in the ones that are sick that you'll bless them Lord and bring them back to church service father we ask these things in the name of Jesus Christ amen your dismiss God bless you take the name of Jesus with you
