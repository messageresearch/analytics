brother dale out i asked him if i could bring him out so if you don't mind we're all stand just briefly and i want to open the eyes marvin oh we got the offering to do let's all stand as we pick up the offer glory amen you yes let's uh let's go ahead and sing open the eyes by heart they'll be through by the time brother day will come um loving praise that's what we are we amen open the eyes of my heart open the eyes of my heart open the eyes of my heart lord open the eyes of my want heart see you to see holy shining in the light of your glory pour out your power in love as we sing holy holy you are a holy holy if you be seated for one minute i got about a five minute testimony i just want to share with you i can't think of a better time for a test for without a test you cannot have a testimony than the study of the stature of the perfect man and i want to ask you a question and just think about this i'm going to be kind of broad but i'm going to bring very simple where were you setting when you were 15 years old just think about this and think about a journey 15 years old my father had built a company a plant from the ground up he'd lost his job he went out about a million and a half dollars built a plant and made the 1967 air conditioner pulley for ford motor company and that went on for a couple years until the guy that loaned him the money died in an airplane crash it devastated my father i grew up two cadillacs in a garage a jaguar i mean life has always been good i've always been blessed but that was on the material side before i ever heard the word amen so i've been at the highest high and i've been at the lowest low i've been in a place at 18 years old when our family split my father said leave my mother my brother and my sister walked out of a house down a highway no place to lay our head but you know that was my journey built some character but i just want to share with you a couple things that's happened you know as most of you might know i lost my job last friday because i i really believe it's because for what i stood for what i believed in i'd been asked to terminate four people and i couldn't justify it so time went on so every dog has his day as they say so i just turn around and walk away but i've never been without a job more than a weekend that that happened on friday i was getting calls monday morning people shocked that i lost my job they were no better more shocked than i was trust me have you ever been hit in the face with a shovel you could just imagine what it feels like when you're totally unexpected when a man now listen man's word comes to you every day for six years or once a week at least and says you're never gonna leave me are you you're never gonna retire you'll have a job here as long as you want and you put faith in what that man tells you there's a lot of employees listening in today i invited them to hear the word and how the lord has worked in their lives and they never recognized what he was doing maybe they're watching maybe they're not but my boss would call me and he'd say i need you to pray for me in situations and i would pray for him and things would happen there's a young man out there that i believe has taken my place last i heard last night that was a citizen or tried to become a citizen he was from another country he had a little problem in his background as a young man before he really became at the age of 18 years old it stopped him from becoming a citizen they came to me asked me to pray i wrote letters to the governor because i know a lot of people throughout the state and through our home school stance what we went through and met a lot of people well you know this problem this young man had in his background mysteriously went away now it's not mysterious how it went away i know how it went away okay there was an engineer that came to me and he asked me i said something in the email and i prayed and mentioned something he kind of made light of it laughed about it three weeks later his house burned but he they restored it and he's back in it i'm just trying to tell you some things that happen on the job and funny thing about this job that i just have left i was working for a gentleman i helped him start a company and he's actually building a new plant right now but he was uh i was standing there been there five years with him just working my own business and being a good employee and one day i asked the lord i said lord if it be you will i change jobs give me a sign 30 minutes i haven't looked for a job in five years 30 minutes my phone rings it takes me to this job that i just left so with that said faith and the study of the statute perfect man is what's made me strong amen it's funny and we're studying if you have a book a extra book about what is the holy spirit was the holy spirit given for we should bring it to us to use in our sunday school class because the students and i and kids were studying beginning that study of what is the holy spirit and i often tell him i said you watch what happens downstairs here and when you go upstairs and tell me if you don't see the holy spirit working but today i didn't prepare as well as i should have but the lord laid on my heart to read john 1. we talked about john 1 all the way through it and what happened we come up here brother dale reads it josiah looks at me and he goes because i tell him i said you watch where the holy spirit's working amen okay and then just couple weeks ago i told jan i said you know i wish i had some way that i could be with you all the time well i had a boss tell me one time he said be careful for what you wish for you might get it so they might think that they terminated me but i believe or we separate whatever but i just believe that the lord's worked in a lot a way for me to be around how and audrey and help them at the time of need of things going on we've got so much things to do he's prepared us a way to sit back i sat down and i was wanting somebody to read the chapter isaiah 2 before i started my testimony this morning because of what talked about the silver and the gold and all the things in it but just read that when you leave here sometime and just see how he just mysteriously laid that on the heart when i sit down this morning open my bible but i've laid hands on equipment i've laid hands on stuff at work and it's just amazing the problems went away and things went to running when i started with that company six years ago they hadn't made a profit in five years and tell you how the lord's blessed what we did and it took every one of us it's not what i did but it's what he did and they need to realize that's what he did because another reason why i've been probably parted with a company is they have to the plan business plan has changed where they have to recover before anything happens they have to recover forty thousand dollar negative to the month then your expenses start i had a budget about forty thousand dollars a month so they have to recover that much money every month just to make their profit line last two three four five years they would come to me and say there's sixty thousand dollars you need to spend it this month there's fifty thousand dollars extra you need to spend it this month today they've gotta recover a hundred and forty thousand dollars starting january 1 to even get back to where they were at so my work was finished there i shared with the lord they called me a man of the cloth a preacher all that i never walked around talking about the lord unless somebody asked me right i never forced it on them and that's what i'm trying to tell my children in sunday school just take on the son of man ministry make the word come alive in the flesh that's what the message is amen but all of this is about building character amen i stand proud with a clear conscience that i served and owe nothing and i thank you all for your prayers and continue to pray for me amen let's stand together somebody left some glasses in their keys downstairs laying on the table uh okay here it should take them back they just somebody walked by and found them laying there and didn't want to leave them out in the open you know and all but you know you follow the lord he'll take care of you sister johnny i used to talk to her a lot on the telephone when she was up in new york and uh it took a long time for it to get through to her what was going on because they would get ready to shut down certain things of what she was doing and you know just right before they'd shut it down they'd move her out of that department into another and she'd come tell me she said they just moved me out well three months later they just moved me out one day i said do you realize what's taking place he said well i believe the lord lead me and you know she wound up being up under and i even knew the the lady that was the ceo or whatever don lowe she yeah she was you know right up under her and then they finally shut down everything you know and she gets to retire well sometimes you know the lord's working things out so just go along with it and wait to see what he's doing he may work it out in the right way but the boyd said he doesn't receive three phone calls about a job well lord take care of it he always has he's he's never left it you know where that he doesn't lead all right think of these things amen if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn where we'll read in revelations 1 and then we'll go to philippians 2. try to continue our thought on from this morning so we'll it i thought it was a good time maybe to do a little background catch up to where we're at and just preach a little bit you know and then we can move on all right so remember these we were wading them on the way in home this afternoon and pray that the lord would bless and take care heavenly father we thank you for everything we love you and we carry lord for what you are desiring to do among us we care very heavily about it because we want to do that and we know and realize that there's none of us worth anything so we just leave it all aside and say thank you lord you're taking care of it not you always will and we believe you these are just little tests and trials down here in life that we lord have to put up with but they're great trials for a day coming when things maybe get worse and and all like that but we don't look forward to those things but we do know that they will be coming because it has been said and so let it be lord but yet give us grace when it comes to those times and the hour that is needed we just ask you now to open our eyes to the word that we're trying to speak about and father forgive me when i'm i try to get so hard to try to get people to believe till i know sometimes i turn people off and they're thinking but i've just tried and you you know that and father we just pray that you'd bless and guide each one be awaiting them on the way home and father this afternoon him ministering be with him and lord bless and god each and every one of us remember the sick remember brother gary there lord we know that his foot's busted open and a lot of problems with it and we pray that you would just reach down and touch him and deliver him from that because we believe you have your way now as we read your words you come on the scene to speak to our hearts in jesus name amen verse 10 revelation 1 i was in the spirit on the lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying i am alpha and omega the first and the lies and what thou seest write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in asia unto ephesus and under smyrna and unto pergamos and under titara and under sardis and under philadelphia and under lady osea and i turned to see the voices spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks and one in the midst of the seven candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlestick one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the paps with a golden girdle all right let's go over to philippians to try to pick up our thought from this morning and maybe move on into some things verse 5 let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being now that's not your brain that's not your brain mind that is the holy spirit to dwell in your heart to give you understanding all right who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant was made in the likeness of men and been found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross you may be seated the lord add his blessing to the reading of the word now to try to move pretty fast through our background point remember that we have been talking about the condescending of god we'll give a couple of quotes in a minute i hope you list looked on your computer and just write in condescend or condescending you'll find that brother branham covered a lot on that and you think that i'm trying to drag this thing out i'm trying my best to shorten it and even like this afternoon i want to pack three messages into one okay so if i take a few extra minutes forgive me and just bear with me because i want to talk about you know uh how that god can come down and reveal himself to a mortal being now that's that's uh that's something isn't it amen and i believe that and we've been talking about you know that and go ahead brother if you will pull up the uh the little drawing with the attributes written on it and we've been talking about that how that brother branham would say in the beginning but before the eternal and then he say in the beginning was the word and when time began it was word but before it was word it was attribute or thought all right then we made a little drawing just something happy to understand and we place the word eternal in the middle and we back up onto this side to say before the eternal which is just an expression a way of saying that you say yeah but there's nothing before well that's where you're not listening you you know you need to go back and listen to the other day when i was trying my best to express that we have really made it something by saying eternal you know because that put it into a position that has no beginning or no ending how can you bring a word that would would say anything that is the best word that could be thought of so then it's placed there as eternal all right but back before that eternal part could be is to me to me the prophet is trying to explain how that way back in eternities back here in eternities you remember on christ the mystery of god revealed he said let's go in the back part of god's mind see keep on going on back you know going this way and in doing it we can see those things as they're there all right and then we we know for surety that the word creation in god's terminologies doesn't deal with creation like we do because the prophet went on one day to say that the first creation was god himself well that just your mind goes like that because there's no way to comprehend that it has to be revealed and by thinking about it then it's really just him in his ways of trying to express it to where it would give us some idea or a thought you know that we could be able to to comprehend that there was a time that there was nothing as far as we think but now watch what i'm saying now that's a direct quote right a time there was nothing but remember god was there so he's not meaning there was a time there was no god that could be a thought as well as anything else if you're just going to deal with it on that way you know there was a time that there was nothing like we have here existences and different things but there was never a time that there wasn't god if it is you had him beginning you know well if you have him beginning then he's just like us and who created who that's what i've always said about the the trinity people you know who created who did the father create the son and the son create the holy ghost and you know that's that's beyond all comprehension of the human mind but we try to do it all right but now remember we talked about each attribute and looking at those attributes brother brown said that so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed in him was love in him was to be father in him was to be son and him was to be savior in him was to be healer and these attributes that we see already express they were in him i remember this morning i said we look at it as we think that what it is there's just a possibility for something to be able to go over that away no they were already there he said but but but there was nothing lost let me ask you a simple question did being lost make him a savior now being lost is an attribute upon earth it didn't make him a savior it made him display the point of a savior because if not then somewhere he had to develop the savior point right and remember what i said this morning then we think that he just had these abilities but there was nothing there well all of the quotes from the prophetess we'll read will say that they were already there all right now i wish you would look at that drawing for one time and then you can see what we're trying to talk about and was this morning about and we'll be spending a lot this afternoon about god not changing and but only thing he changes changes his form and then trying to tie attributes with him and with it and going into part of god and uh look at the drawing and think now he didn't develop father i mean he he didn't become father he brought it into being right so it already was father now look at each one of those individually is that a manifestation of god father all right his son a manifestation of god is logos speech a manifestation of god is savior a manifestation of god is healer theophany christ is the word a manifestation of god then you realize that you can't take out any one of those because you're taking away from god but do you realize each one of them is god in another form right now that should become simple it's god in another form but if you take out one of them what have you got you're taking away from his form look at that as each one a form of god then you can look at father son and holy ghost the prophet would say the three attributes of god is father son and holy god take away one of those any one of them and you don't have the full truth do you see if you do away with any form of god anywhere here or there after or before whatever if you do away with any form of god you've really you've gone into worse than trinitarianism or or the oneness concept you've gone into what the scripture says that if you take away what did he say he'd take away you see just look at it just simply look at it and think about it each one of those is a form of god you say well how do you know because they have come over to hear and been displayed down through time right and that's the point i want you to get is looking at it as we know the prophet would give the words you know of immorphy god changing his form all right see then if once he does away with one four in other words move from one form to the other he doesn't do away with that form it wouldn't matter if i lived to be 150 years old i wouldn't do away with the fact of being husband father grandfather great grandfather you keep adding instead of doing away you know unfolding as things come into being but now watch that just take that thought and think about it see we we want to get to a point where i just can't quite understand but why not do as he said they're from christ the mystery and all these great attributes that we see already expressed they were in god all right so we never gained an attribute investment he says were the great attributes of god where he was before he was for he even was god before there was god is an object of worship before he even become that he was still god he is the eternal and these attributes was in him and they just display themselves that was in him now i want to drive that hard because if you can't see that those attributes within him then you can't follow anything of coming on over and displaying those attributes because you're going to be adding taken away et cetera and it will not work god's provided approach i'm just quoting these to where we'll get to it and then we'll start reading in a minute now these attributes was in him so that may so that made it display something to worship the first thing he made was angelic beings attributes he had attributes to be sung at attributes to be savior in him was the attributes of healer attributes to be god see that's back before he ever brings anything into being that would be a worship part or would be healing that would do you can't make an eternal healing i mean an eternal sickness all right so we know there was a time sickness started but there was never a time that god started it's only the basis that you're dealing with he's made angelic beings and they worship him now we've come up into the understanding of the word god but he always was god well i can't understand that well that's what i say you need to pray because i can't explain it and if your prophet and me reading it to you from what he says that can't explain it either it takes a revelation right i can do the best i can of simplifying it the prophet done the best i believe he could do of simplifying it but yet our minds are still connected back to that link of seeing things but remember how i tried to explain it the this attribute of father well you know one day he was displayed the attribute of son one day was displayed because that's the condescending of god to bring it to where we can see those things all right and see we know there couldn't be a uh you know which came first brother luis is getting him our wednesday about it and which one came first the chicken or the egg and the you know we believe the chicken came first because it was created he didn't create eggs and let them hatch all right well see which came first sickness or savior did he become a savior because of a sickness no he was a savior so thereby we know before the world now i hope you're listening to what i'm trying to drive that before the world he knew what he's going to do you agree with that he knew he was going to create man he knew if he created man he would go wrong do you need those quotes they are there in the prophet's message so you ought to know it but which came first sickness or healer the healer was already there or the sickness wouldn't have come right see we we want to make it the sickness would come then he becomes a healer you've made him change and see you're not listening to the thought because of what i said here each one of those could be isolated by itself and make him a father it could be isolated by a son but each one of those is god made manifest now what do we get to it a while in the message and we'll be reading where brother branham said that he didn't send a son he said he came himself well all right let's start off right let's start off right he came himself see like i said who could talk like a prophet he said now our english word i can't remember what it is in our body house like vomit and time he said but that's not right with god he said but a part of god went out part of god you said that ain't even sensible i agree with you but it's truth he said not an arm went off right now one of these days you're going to be able to understand and catch it then you'll see that why i believe when he comes here all god was poured into christ now i'm going to say it so you go ahead and laugh and differ with it that's a part of god that's right but let's go on over and all christ was he poured into the church that's a part of god see that requires thinking it requires revelation it requires us to get rid of our mentalities of what we think is right and believe god's word well i don't understand you really confused me i didn't confuse you i just made known you're confusing you get mad at me paul said if i become your image because i tell you the truth all right see then we say what the prophet said and then everybody why don't you say what the prophet said well i want to hear you women are who wade finishes this series i'll even give you your dear sisters a week or two to explain one god some other way than what i've tried my best for 50 years to express to you but remember i'm going to do you like a man at work one time he differed with me about the god head and i said okay now what i'm going to do i'm going to stand here and listen to you and i want you to start explaining your great revelation i said but now remember you've been fussing with me you know everything i've said no that ain't right no it's got to be just what i said you've been doing that with me so now for a minute i'm going to change the story around a little bit and i want you to start explaining your great revelation but i said when you come to a point that you're off the word i'm going to raise my hand and say hold it you're out of the word i said you agree with me he said yeah he said two words i raised my hand that's no joke because he already went off the word but you see then to me then see i'm called a smart aleck on intellect because of doing that well if it's i thought god could work in any way he wanted to i thought he could use a dumb donkey to bring the truth all right it don't give you no right to reject it don't matter who it's brought by you're dealing with god you're not dealing with with man but do you understand what i'm getting at when he displayed himself as father that was an attribute or form of god all right now each one of these is god that can be made manifest right simple does it make that many gods no it makes a god it can be made manifest so remember we're not looking at a first person sending a second person that needed a third person to get it to you brother branham say it he's not even do you want this quote i may have it in here but it's fine he said he's not even the first person you remember that he said he is the person because if you made him the first person that would mean his ability to be two or more persons but when he's the only person there's no ability to change anything brother branham was to me you you called me a smart aleck and hard but you listened to him i i never got around to saying that so that doctrine y'all got it so shallow that you you know get off a shot of a chicken and starve to death you know but everybody said i'm running around love me yeah okay he did or he wouldn't have said it that way all right but do you understand now these attributes was in him before anything developed of any form they were in him now then maybe you'll realize one of these days why i believe god is real and why did i believe that he's a being and that's what i've been hammering about i don't believe it before the world back over here in the eternities that he was just a glob of iron floating around because there was no error that's what your prophet said now go ahead and argue he said before anything adams are molecules right you know it might have been a beautiful place that he lived in yeah but you're just making him too real i wish i could drive it so hard to let you to see how real he is anything you think is real remember he created it and how can the thing that created it be lower than a what is created you know that this is a plain language he could set back before the world before anything and he could think about all of the things that was going to relate to father he could think about all the things he was going to relate to son he could think of all of the things that relate to healer savior the theophany the christ the logos that we think are beautiful words that we really think makes us something because we say them what do you think about before this world ever got started in any form i remember i all and i believe it that's more real than what this is yes do you mean brother dale do you think that that back there that god could have been up there doing that now i'm not exactly with the thor ideas okay your kids would understand more than adults maybe but you know they say thunder is is thor or zeus one throwing rolling balls through the heavens and they're running into the clouds and bloom bloom you know no not exactly that way i just believe he was real you know what i believe he's real because i believe he's real now whatever remember that comes over here had to be over here well do you believe that there could have been another world before this world no glad you thought of that no i don't because when we use the word word world we look at this form of what we have right when the word world means cosmos or world order why do you think they would come up with it and i'm not saying this to get any point of making a point they would make a movie and things and call them superman did he come from this planet of krypton now i'm not talking about nothing like that because remember if it comes from a planet then it couldn't have been created until this went over here and created it so get that out garbage out get the point brother reynolds said he was a super being so that would mean super intelligence just use those things as words to express how real that i believe god is and he had all him attributes in him well he could sit there about two million years and think about how he was going to be a father he's going to display and be a savior i was going to be a healer they wouldn't have to have two million years but that's what i'm what i'm pointing is point is to try to get you to look at something simple if it took two seconds he still was thinking and am i right that he thought that when he made man that man would fall is that true he knew we would fall so he must have thought it over right right well that makes it more real than what we are that's attributes in any of those attributes that you deal with he could have said millions of years and thought about how to do you say word brother dale in heaven that's the only words we got isn't it then we've got heavens of heavens of you know but that's the word we use signifying another place above this one or something you know existence all right you might as well get out of that and just go on and forget it because if you can't see it by that then i don't know what else i could say and remember one thing hebrews 13 8 said he's the same yesterday today and forever so whatever was here has got to be here whatever here's got to be there no editions or hebrews 13 8 would be wrong all right then so would it be wrong in um malachi 3 and 6 i believe where he said i'm god and i change not right all right so let's just run through a little bit of what the prophet had to say watch it real carefully then in a minute we'll start reading on the message of the unveiling of god paragraph 88 he says down through the ages the same word so he did not change his nature when he come he is always that prophet he's even talking about that part all down through the age same thing the word the word the word the word see he cannot change his nature but he changed his form hebrews 13 8 he's the same yesterday today forever he just changed his mask all right see then if that's what it is then why are we concerned about the condescending part when we know that he all he done was just change the form yeah he didn't change his nature write that word nature down till we get back we won't get it today i told you the other day i was listening to the message i suppose you i'd write down nature uh if i was you i'd go home look up a little bit about nature you might find something enjoyable look at the next one we'll read for a little while the mighty god unveiled before us 1964 paragraph 35 coming through from 34. and dr scofield you'll find here that his word changing from form we find the word in morphe in the greek which means the unseen was made visible something that cannot we know it's there all right it can be cannot be seen but yet we know that it's dire now we know it's there you know brother ruddell i remember him years ago he had a real good saying he said anybody one-eyed and high cents and that stuck with me i laugh every time i think of it you you get that point anyway invited with one odd and half cents that way that's pretty good but listen and when he changed his form of the amorphy which means that he changed from supernatural to natural and he just changed his mask in other words it's like the drama he was acting in the greek and they would change their mass maybe one play you know player might have acted in several parts he just changed his mask in order to come out to the impersonate another character all right so that's coming downward all right and when you do look at what he's covering go ahead with number eight it's pretty good reading of questions and answers on genesis we'll start with verse 26. now no man has seen the father at any time no man has seen god in the bodily form because god is not in body form god is a spirit see all right no man has seen the father but the only begotten of the father hath declared him first john okay now we've been through that we've expressed it when he says that he that god is a spirit we went through giving many of it and we'll give a few more but he he said god is a spiritual being and he's not like the wind that just floats around but see we still hook but god is a spirit well what image is he going to create the man now eventually that's right are you going to create him a spirit mother where do we get there but i notice now there's nothing there's just space there's no light there's no dark there's no nothing it just seems nothing but entire is a great supernatural being in all of this nothing is a great supernatural being jehovah god who covered all space of all places of all times he was from everlasting from everlasting he is the beginning of creation that's god god can't god can't see nothing but can't hear nothing not a move woman adam he's talking about what was back darcy but yet god was there and that was god and what's down a few minutes no man has seen that now that's the father that's god the father then after a while i began to see a little sacred light begin to form now if we had the drawing up you would realize you just stepped on the other side now that's the first time that i've stepped on the other side uh all i've been before has been back here on this side in eternity now we step over and we start into what is the creation now watch the creation then and you'll see what i'm talking about this morning who created all things the son because he stepped across but what was that son god in another form called a son and created all time right see the sacred light began to form like a little halo or something you're going to see it by spiritual eyes to look now while we're looking in the whole whole church now and we're standing on a great big banister watching what god's doing and we'll get right down to this question here what people were talking to now no one has seen god and now the next thing we begin to see by eyes of supernatural looking we see a little white light forming out there what is that it was called by bible readers logos or the anointed or the anointing or the as i was going to say the part of god began to develop into something so human beings could have some type of an idea what it was it was a little low a little light moving he that was the word of god now god gave himself birth to this son in which the son which was before there was even an atom and remember when we moved over i said you don't start time see we want to start time when we jump over from eternity you got to seven days creation that's fine but time really began when sin come into the world right because remember it says god created watch now now god gave himself birth to the son which was before there was even an adam in the our hour to make an adam that was jesus said glorify me father with the glory that we had before the foundation of the world see way back in yonder now jesus could say that the flesh wasn't talking right flesh wasn't before world pride right so now who's talking god who stepped over in another form but remember when he stepped over it was only part one of those attributes i pointed out while ago can be the fullness of god but they can also be just apart ours we're going to take a revelation because of our mind twisting of that word part and he goes on talking about john 1 and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us god unfolded himself down to a human being now watch how he did it now back there now that's what i said and i was going to caution you when you come because when he gets over brother ranum is explaining before the world and then he's explaining after the world how jesus come into being but just remember one points okay if he's explaining after he comes into being he can't come into being no other way than what he was before right so don't get all confused why he don't know what he's talking about because that's talking about jesus coming into the world well that's exactly what i'm talking about that's how he started from back there to come down to where he could come out to be jesus standing here right when this little halo of light we can't see nothing yet but just by the eyes are just supernatural we see a halo standing there now that's the son of god the logos and i can see him playing around like a little child before the father's door think that's something ain't no theologian to figure that out and you and i can't either you're gonna have to believe it to let god reveal it right see the son of god the logos now i can see him playing around like a little child here child before the father's door and what he'll come in another quote a minute and he said now see there's where it said in the beginning was the word all right now remember he's a little child playing before the father's door then what i was reading this morning was right jesus christ is the creator the father is not creating it's the father in the form of the son or else you've missed all them scriptures i gave this morning i changed a lot this morning because the company that was fine but i didn't change a lot because all that was in my mind earthling remember all those scriptures verify that jesus christ was the creator these quotes are verifying the same thing i can see him playing around like a little child before the father's door with all eternity and now then in his imagination who the son of god is that who he's explaining all right in his an imaginary makeup he began to think of what things would be and i can hear him say let there be light and when he did an atom bursted and the sun came into existence remember wednesday night brother louise done a good job of what he was explaining you remember what he was talking about in the basis that uh god that gay adam the ability to name all the animals right now where'd he get that from it wasn't a guess and a hit and a mess well that looked like a bear so i'll call it a bear he didn't have no bear to look at right right when these days we'll realize why over in the old testament that a man could walk out there one day and he said lord i'll give you everything i got he said i don't want that he said i'll give you 10 where do you think he got that thought from where do you think moses got to thought to write what happened in genesis it was moses thought yeah it was adam's thought and word but who was directing his thoughts come on let there be name it a squirrel name it a bear name it a horse coming from god down through a human being though that would speak it out and remember he was speaking it out before he went into human flesh because he was leading the animals then when he got into human flesh he could surely bring out what god wanted to call them but you got to put them two together because if you don't you're going to run into trouble but you understand what i'm getting at where do you think this one then watch and now then in his imaginary makeup the son of god where did he get the talk from if he was another person you had to direct it down one to the other but if he was the person then whatever was back on this side of the world of the thoughts of god in his mind would come over on the other side are you with me and then you can say let us make man now you've got not two people right that's right amen come on you understand what the prophet is getting to when he begin when he got his imaginary mind when he got everything he picks up the thought the thought is transmitted down and when it's transmitted down here stands the logos the speech the son of god the christ and he said let us make man right amen there's father and son or if you wanted another way to help you to understand there's word and spirit that's right that's right word spirit of one right if it's quicker you understand what i'm getting at then you're going to find out the prophet is saying that that logos that speech is speaking the things into existence playing before the father's door the son of god and he can say let us because there's two forms of god's there the great eternal and the son of god okay are you listening yes playing around before the father's door look at the next one which goes into the message called life uh e22 let's close our eyes to our imagination for a few moments and go back into there before there was anything the great fountain of eternity the spirit and all the honesty what it do then out of the existence of the father went the logos which was the son that's plain language to me if it confuses you i suggest you pray because out of the existence of the father could move over into another form and i will keep making this statement that a part of god went out called a son we'll read them quotes in a minute he said brother dale is it necessary for us to understand these things yes is it necessary for us to understand father han son and holy ghost comparisons of the lord jesus christ in water baptism if one of the part of the word is important i thought all of it was if i was out here trying to bring some great discourse without reading what your prophet said you could make that statement that we don't need this but when the prophet brought it that's right i thought that he came to bring us the word well you know when these are this was preached in 1953. questions and answers on genesis right brother ray was mentioning the other day a message called who is god now you have to look at it sometimes it'll say attitude and who is god um 1950 is it 7 29 1950 it's 1950 and brother branham is explaining these things there's a couple of quotes in here in a minute see go back to those ole miss we're going to get over into the third pool after the steel's broke if we don't understand this don't be concerned with the seals don't be concerned with the rapture don't be concerned with those things but you see when i quote things like that people get all upset brother branham said if you don't understand daniel 70 weeks you can't understand the seals but nobody wants to preach on daniel 70 weeks i didn't make that statement it's in the book that's right i'm the smart elect that found it right amen but look then out of the existence of the father went the logos which was the son okay all god was he poured into christ his pouring in was way back there that's where it's going you don't have to listen one of these days if i ever get enough time to get to it i told you 40 years ago i said i see something but i can't explain it that's no longer that day amen that son of god was god in another form not another god or either english missed its wording then out of the existence of the father went the logos did it do away with the father it enhanced the father it made the father into a greater view which was the theophany which was the body that great jehovah god went forth in a celestial body that's the logos the word spoke out of them great fountains of life and went forth and there was the theophany which was god made into word amen his words let's read on number 10 preparation sitting way back in eternity that was god and then going out of god this is 19 and 53 11 11. then going out of god are god unfolding himself come the logos which was the son of god are the word of god see now you're getting to the john 1. the beginning was the word with god and the word was god now you're getting your book because that's what he's saying here in the beginning was the word with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us the logos now watch we're seeing god unfold himself then he said in genesis let us make man in her own image what kind of a man was he he had to be a spirit man he's in the image of god but we want to make him a spirit um your god's not real if you got him just a spirit floating around because he's not like the wind he's not like the air come on look he had to be a spirit man and then he put him in five senses to contact his earthly home you might give him a foot like a bar and a hand like a monkey i don't know what he did genesis is one man let us make man our image was put in the flesh in genesis 2 right is that true i mean that scripture or with it see who was that that was created then in genesis let us make man whatever whatever the image that the man came into if it's right according to the scriptures and the prophet it's the same image when the man is brought right that's right i'm talking about his flesh man get off of him spirit man and whatever the image is it's got to be the image of the father and the son amen because let us man you're close to trinitarianism i love to walk here because here is where i dwell look at the next one thirsting for life and i have the catholic people hear the book called facts of our faith and they use the word of eternal sonship of god the word don't even make sense to me the word eternal means eternity which had no beginning or has no end and son means had a beginning so how could it be it could be a eternal godship but never an eternal sonship remember the quote just before then out of the existence of the father came the son now you're making two out of it what about an eternal godship amen you believe in the eternal god head i've got one in here that he did now according to my understanding what do you mean when you say godhead father son holy ghost make godhead right well what about an eternal godhead you better make the son the father in another form or you just lost your wording and trapped your own self no okay it could be an eternal godship but never an eternal sonship a certain one is that's begotten of so it had to so it had a beginning so the logos which was the son of god went out created by these great fountains of purity god as those spirits went out and it created the logos you know the word probably using the word create and it was a body it was in the form of what we are now which is called in clergy way of speaking a theophany it's a body that doesn't have a spirit in it it's a body that's waiting for you christians as soon as you die and you remember now because we're getting into something now we're going to pick up some ground you remember when brother branham went beyond the curtain of time the angel of the lord said this is theophany he said that's where he saw him in theophany remember he could feel him he could see him he could hear him well we're getting to something real think about it okay let's go to the next one questions and answers on hebrews this is the part 2 57 10 02. now he says it don't even make sense eternal sonship of god see there cannot be an eternal son because a son had to have a beginning and so jesus had a beginning now show me where he ever said to christ at the beginning jesus the flesh had a beginning right okay so jesus had a beginning god had no beginning see but the son was not eternal sonship but the son that was with the father in the beginning was the logos that went out of god god in another form you want the quotes ahead of time a part of god and it was the theophany of god that went out the human form that didn't have eyes like you see a better eye he didn't have ears like you here but far more hearing it was a see it was a theophany and all this rainbow condescended into theophany moses saw it when it passed through the rock like that he saw the back part said it looked like a man well you know brother brandon when he saw those people beyond the curtain of time they were real right that's right they were not spirits floating around hey brother branham you remember in his early ministry if you think i can't remember decent you remember in his early ministry he thought that's what they'd be you remember that he thought they would be he said brother neville i couldn't shake his hand he said caught his hands in the grave he said but i see him and i know he's standing there but then when he went beyond the curtain of time he come back and he said they're real one of these days we're going to realize eternal life is real eternal life is not thoughts and ideas it's a person here's the message who is god go to number 13 priest in 1958-15 right great space and no way to confathom it and he said that's jehovah god out there and we're taught in the beginning that the logos or the son of god went out of god i do not believe in eternal sonship that's even radical to even mention such a thing eternal sonship how he had a eternal he had a eternal sonship now watch him what he's not saying that he was eternal sonship it's even it's even eternal sonship how could it be a son see he's not saying that there could be an eternal sonship he's explained it not so look what he said so he first was god jehovah and out of him let's just picture now as a little drama so you can get it let's see coming out of space where there's nothing let's make it a little white light like a mystic light like a halo that was the logos that went off god in the beginning that was the son of god that came out of the bosom of the father that was what was in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word god was god and the word was made flesh now that's jumping all the way to the flesh man and dwelt among us in the beginning was god and then out of god came to logos a part of god that went out of god now a part of god that went out of god but brother hell oh you i thought i had it figured out all these years i've been studying it and now you're dividing him up in pieces no i'm not that's right simple terminologies to me father steps over into son steps on over in the holy ghost same god yeah but you just don't understand we'll explain this that son that you believe to be almighty god in human flesh and we believe that right we believe in him was the fullness of the godhead bodily we believe that you know that he didn't know when he was coming back right and brother randall said he didn't know his part in the kingdom until he come to the isle of patmos i thought i had it figured out i was beginning to see it and now you skunk me again all right now you're gonna have to pray rolling up a little further because you're more to that where is that that depart okay i was looking for e17 yeah that's it and then there now we see this just like a child playing before the door it was the son of god the logos i can see him out there and he spake and said let there be light and there was nothing but there was something happened and adam burst adam turned there and began to whirl around this way the sun began to come into existence because he said let there be there's the authority where did he make it from i don't know there was nothing to make it from but he believed his own word and there was light and i can see a piece fly off of that it's a meteor after a few million years or 100 million big hundred billions of years you want to call it and it circled way out i see him standing there watching it and it falls down in here he stops it after it falls a few million years and let it hang out there in orbit here comes another one flying off the sun and goes over here and hangs there stopped it there what's he doing he's making all of the stars and the moon and the universe and all the things from the word and we're still tied up uh what happened on day one world created on day one you're already quiet because you're afraid to move uh-uh it says that's why brother brown said it don't matter about all these things that claim is so old he said it says in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth period and in day one things begin to be created day one was not creation of the world your prophet's right right millions of billions of years and then day one we'll get to that when we get time day one this was created day two that was created showing his nature oh i'd love to get to that but watch him in the next one the unveiling of god paragraph 77 and 78 and when he said here that he emptied himself or poured out they would think like this that he vomited up the english word of emptied or poured out from him see that's what we think it it signifies to us the english word vomit poured out something went out of him that was different from him that's what we think when we're looking at the word but the word kinos in the greek does not mean that he vomited up or something his arm went off or his eyes went out another person it didn't mean an arm go out and i go out or another person that is he changed himself he poured himself into into another mask into another form not another person went out of him called the holy spirit but it was he himself you get it not another person went out it was he himself right but keep in mind what he's saying apart went out now you see why did i bring it and say well don't leave an empty space now when you say all god what poured into christ and all christ into the church just don't leave an empty space right because you're only dealing with what god's going to make manifest down here and you're only dealing with a part of god that's what your prophet is explaining go ahead what was your explanation oh the great father created the son and the creator son created the holy ghost or you know you know we're ooh i won't get that not another person me into another mask another form not another person went out of him called the holy spirit but was he himself congregation holiday amen he poured himself into the people christ in you how beautiful how wonderful to claim god pouring himself into the human being into the believer pour out it was a part of his drama to do so god all the fullness all the godhead bodily was in this person jesus christ he was god and god alone not a second not a third person or a second person or a first person but the person god failed in human flesh let me see how much further i can go let's see if we can get these things on the part and then i'll quit on the other part okay go ahead to the next one which is hebrews chapter one wait a minute we got to 15. i'm better 14 come on steph where you let's at on the back of the page i can find it all right show us the father and it'll satisfy us look what he says and there he come out there was nothing and then here come the logos that looked like a halo hanging under no man has seen god at any time now and here's the logos looks like it's a supernatural being it's a halo that's the son of god not eternal sonship because the words don't do good together that's the catholic doctrine but eternal how could it be a sonship and be eternal if he's a son he'd had to have a beginning of time eternals forever see so eternal sonship there's no such a word to make that sensible but it was the logos that went out of god and there he was playing out there in space just like a child before the door i can see him draw the whole picture in his mind of the kingdom and what it might be do you have any problems the end of saying well let us the father transmitting over or coming over into another form called a son and he can have so much connection until what this father had in mind is in the mind of the son is that any problem you know all right can you give me about 10 minutes okay we'll get this part out of the way where i can go on look at number 16 because i love this hebrews chapter five and six part one wrote it up god didn't have three persons up there and send one of them his son it was god himself come in the form of a son now brother branham could talk about a son being back there in the eternities and say he didn't believe in eternal sonship right come on people want to say brother brandon made all these mistakes why don't somebody get a hold of something like that that's got even a little sense to it but it ain't got no sense if you go on and read he's talking about something existing with the father that's eternal and says he don't believe in eternal sonship within the sun would have to be the father made manifest in another form right right or else you got eternal sonship okay god didn't have three people up there and send one of them his son it was god himself come in the form of a son a son has a beginning and the son had a beginning that some of you dear catholic people i got your book facts of our faith the eternal sonship he said how could that be that word is not right for everything that's a son had a beginning and eternal has no beginning so it isn't eternal sonship christ become the flesh and dwelt among us he had a beginning wasn't no eternal sonship it's the eternal godhead not sonship now he came to redeem us and he didn't read and he did redeem us go on to the next let's read feist this is so us the father and look what he said let us plural make man plural in our image what was he there is this supernatural being there's the one that could not be seen god the father never was seen never will be seen he's all nature and there he is and now here's the son which is the logos that went out of him made into his image a supernatural being that went out in the beginning i'll be glad to give you these of you i started to just do them all off you know and let you read all of these but questions and answers on genesis 53 he made the sun the first thing you know a big clinker a big clinker fell off of it weighed just about like this earth and went through then this logos here now the son of god is watching it he lets it fall for 100 million years and he stops it then another one flies off and he lets it fly off the flew off fall for millions of years then he stops it and we're standing watching this as it comes into existence he's got something in his mind he went on to say look at these now for a minute and if i just sketch down through it forgive me and read what we're getting at i'm going to go to paragraph 128 bring it on up because save time now that's the reason back down you know too far let me get this no no judgment doesn't follow law and law you know and when judgment was passed by law which brings death and there's no one could pay that the penalty but god himself and he paid the penalty of our death and took our sins upon him that we might be the righteousness of god through him now when these great lights went out are the great rays of spirit love peace that's all there was that there wasn't no suffering there wasn't no hate no malice it couldn't come from this fountain that was jehovah that was jehovah god and now as the theologians call it a theophany went out from that which was called in the scripture the logos the logos that went out of god it's hard to explain but it was a part of god now don't connect that as god in part it's a part of god there's a lot of difference in the two statements right a part of god can be god made manifest but don't try to divide him up in parts all right at thy word go ahead let's get fires so the first no okay who is so he first was god jehovah and out of him let's just picture now as a little drama so we can get it let's see coming out of space where there's nothing let's make it a little white light like a mystic like like a halo then i read that and white on him in the beginning that was the son of god that came out of the wisdom of the father i'd already read that that's logos part of god okay go to the next sorry about that next one is that thy word 1951. you talk about even the holy spirit and angels and all that was just attributes of god it's just a part of god it's his makeup it's part of it that went out his spirit and so forth that he created to be his helpers around to the great see all right keep on reading grab the next one this is taken from the unveiling of god all right his arm went off his eye went out because that's what the greek word means in vomit count but it's not the kinos word that is he changed himself he poured himself into amen into another mask into another form not another person went out of hymn called the holy spirit but it was he himself you get it the congregation says amen he he himself poured himself into the people christ in you how beautiful how wonderful i done read this but i want to read again himself into the human being and to the believer pour out it was part of his drama all right go to the next i wanted to read that again because a lot of these i repeat taken from the message curtain of time god which was a part of god god seen what the end would be from the beginning and the logos come to the earth which was the christ the word spoken word of god part of god and was made flesh and dwelt among us and there and then we come out of christ which makes the same life that was in god in christ in you all right what is the problem go to the next one this is questions and answers on genesis he was in other words adam the first man in the lower creation of god the first creation you know this quote because we did it before the first creation was god himself then out of god came the logos which was the son of god that out of the logos which was the word in the beginning was the word and the word with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us out of the low guys came forth what the man genesis 1 26 the man all right then where are we going look at the revelation of jesus christ page 34 really church age book would you like an old testament type let's go back to the garden of eden when the first news came to glory that the son adam had been lost did god send an angel did he send a son did he send another one like unto us no he came himself to redeem that lost son hallelujah god did not entrust his god did not entrust his plan of salvation to another watch it he trusted it only himself god was made flesh and dwelt among us and redeemed us unto himself we're saved by the blood of god the eternal god in dwell a mortal body in order to take away sin he became the lamb in order to shed his blood and enter into the veil go to the next this is the message and thy seed shall possess in the garden of eden when god had to his knowledge and true to his word when eve and adam had done evil when god himself running up and down through the garden hollering adam adam where art thou where art thou adam if somebody wants to know where who this man was jesus who was he coming hunting his first lost son did god sent an angel he come himself he came himself right okay go to the next one this is taken from the message jehovah jireh and another thing did you notice god never sent an angel down to hunt up his lost child he came himself that's the reason that jesus was made i love that one i love that statement above all the statements i've ever made that's the reason that jesus was made to save you and me right god flesh among us god came himself to redeem his child that's why philip could say show me the father he said philip if i've been so long with you if you've seen me you've seen the father right but he couldn't comprehend it he came to redeem his own that's the reason jehovah was made flesh in his own son to die to sin that was placed upon him to redeem the sinner all right go to the next one god who is rich in mercy there it was to be an eternal atonement this was to be an eternal queen of 105 because he came himself god came down in the form of sinful flesh to make a make a eternal atonement and suffered in the flesh and made the eton atonement and returned back in the form of the holy ghost to confirm that atonement all right go on to the next sorry to read facts but i want to get this done god's provided way and i can see god come to the garden himself did you notice he never sent an angel he never sent some servant he came himself and up and down the garden he went screaming adam adam where art thou you can get into the omnipresent omniscient right god manifested in the flesh god never sent a prophet or an angel he created a body in the wombs of the virgin mary and he was the son of god god left his own regions of glory and he crossed his own cast to come down and become human to dwell among us and there in the beginning when man was lost god never sent an angel he came himself and he saw and he saw through the garden and under every bush and behind until he found his lost child remember i warned you not to think that was only the creation of himself coming into flesh to be and the word was made flesh because whatever he is here he's got to have been back there okay go ahead this one is that day on calvary god had required it no man was worthy no man was able you remember the kinsmen redeemer you remember the lamb and all taking the book no man could do it and god came himself and was made human and lived a human life under human desires and was crucified at calvary and there when satan thought he wouldn't do it he wouldn't go through with it he went to gethsemane no wonder god in human flesh was dying but my god can't die now you just cut off and you'll lose every bit i said in the message brother sean so said god can't said his god couldn't die who we were so and so your prophets he said all right he was nothing less than almighty god in human flesh he came himself the word perfection to offer his blood it had to even come the way it came look what he says on this last one having conferences i guess that's the right one e19 no having conferences should be the last one number 33. all right we got it there you go come on up now how that god was manifest in the flesh in jesus christ to come to the earth not trusted in the hands of an angel or some church authority but he came himself made flesh and dwelt among us hunt out his lost child god didn't take gabriel and say go down and hunt my children he came himself it was a man-sized job a god-sized job let's stand sorry to read suffice and to do it i want to get that out of the way because i want to move on but think about it what are you saying brother dale i believe that i'm saying what the prophet says and i believe what he's saying is that the great eternal had all these attributes in him and then when it comes to starting to display in it he didn't send an angel he came himself to redeem he came himself who was that on the river jordan who was that in the cradle the baby jehovah who is that on the river jordan almighty god but yet brother so-and-so says that that's when he become god that's what i'm telling you be careful what you listen to the bible said he was born to emmanuel so i'm going to take the bible you say well what happened on the river jordan right he was anointed for the ministry that he went forth exactly he could not die for our sins at two years old he could not die for our sins when he was arguing with a priest at the wall at 12 13 years old or whatever it was he couldn't die for our sins when he first started his ministry but then one day at the river jordan the anointing came on him for the ministry that he was to bring and he brought that ministry right he brought the ministry you know what happened in the garden the anointing the prophet said left him what anointing the anointing it came on him on the river jordan not the anointing not the anointing of him being god because he cried out on the cross he said into thy hands i come in my spirit it was either god died on the cross or when you and i are still in our sins but we don't want to believe it i'm sorry i missed it we're supposed to give a doing uh brother homer fraser had an accident on a tractor most of us know brother fraser he had an accident on a tractor busted up his pelvis and different things with his hips and things it was something on the thing and uh i forgot to say that to where we could pray for him but most all of us know brother fraser and he had this accident so let's pray for him that god will touch him and bring him through this he's the one you remember that fell out of the tree stand got busted up and all back a few years ago his brother ron spencer's father-in-law and so let's let's pray now before we before we do any singing okay father we're sorry we forgot about this at the beginning and our mind was so twisted and pulled and but now we were brought to our remembers that we've forgotten it and we ask you to just be with brother fraser lord and reach down and touch him and take care of all of these things that he's had and all the busting up the bones and the things because he's on up in age probably somewhere in his 80s lord and we just ask you father to touch him and to be with him father and set him free all the pain the agonies and things we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen amen what do we got let's sing this you can see let's uh two nights sorry for being just a little bit over this afternoon but i wanted to get the point and to bring out about the part of god you say but i just can't see how that part if you'll get your mind and thinking i will bless his name the father stepped over into another foreign now here's what we're going to get into so think on it brother brown said if you read the bible and don't see christ in every verse go back and read it again we got to come down through that old testament before we bring god into being upon the earth called jesus christ so we got a large journey to make but i hope it's an understanding he is his name again thank you thank you for speaking to our brother thank you lord we love you yes lord we thank you in jesus name amen you know what he has need of we believe you father what he's asking for we thank you in jesus name he is he here here and he's had a lot of problems down through time and you know different things but now he just he can't even do without medication they just about have to keep him knocked out right that's the only way to get the release the only relief they get let's believe it he helped back here build the back part of the church home back there because if it hadn't been for him we would have been really bad shape because uh the guy that was supposed to be in charge he kind of liked alcohol and he kind of got left us and he left all the cement poured out i just happened to be that my wife and i and brother and sister would be come up we were going up to the mountain to a cabin we had and here we are and we get up here and there's james hardly one arm to work with and he's trying to smooth that out well i had to get out in my good clothes and do and and help them smooth out the concrete we didn't get it exactly right but we got it close enough but he's the one that helped do this back here to the back on going that away so let's let's believe that god will take care of it all right father we send this prayer claw for james lord and you just reach down and touch him and you bring him out of all this hurting and things the problems that's going on in jesus name amen just hold a minute little deanna's coming and then we'll pray but i wanted to make an announcement but the little been sick of her stomach crying okay lord jesus her throat and her things is bothering her and her stomach lord we just commit it to you father and believe in you that by your stripes he's healed in jesus name okay amen and amen most of you know that they've been playing around with me for quite a while about an irregular heartbeat and they've done everything thanking this out of the other and they said it for this date and everybody thinks i'm going to set another date and everybody thinks i'm going but nobody knows yet until when we're going because i got to go thursday all right the doctor will determine thursday whether or not i need the shocking of the heart you know to try to put it back in rhythm all right but it'll be thursday when i go back to the doctor they do have me on the sleep machine that i'm you know piggy's not hearing me snore but she hearing all night long and can't turn over and look at me a lot of times because the air's going out and mine's not like the old ones that put it out this is because it's leaking around it i don't have it set on my head correctly but you just pray that the lord and that's what i've done i'm still believing that by the time we get to our thirsty that the doctor is going to say everything's all right now i'm believing that all right you say but brother dale what if it don't happen i'll still be believing what are you going to do i know about his stripes i'm healed i don't care what the doctor says or what they got to do to this body to bring it under subjection you know that doesn't bother me none whatsoever i'm not concerned about what you think scared because of this out of the other if it wasn't for my family in this church i'd love to be in heaven right now but if i said if it wasn't for this my family in this church i'd love to be in heaven i would you know i'd be glad to go home because i don't care the first attack that i had of any problem i sit out there for three hours outside in the deer hunt land it just rejoice it and say lord if you want me to go on here today we won't have none of that problems that they got to run here and run there just take me on but take care of the family but if you ain't through with me then just make everything all right and we'll we'll do that all right and i believe he still i believe he's going to take care of it i don't have no concern but i leave it up to him it's like i told the doctor i said listen doc i believe in your program because we believe in medical science up to a point that's what i told him i said but who do you think has taken care of me for 74 years you know 74 years before you wind up with a an irregular heartbeat well you think i'm worried about an irregular heartbeat i just life when he said i said doc who's been taking care of me all these years i said that's one i depend on we had to go over the other day to another doctor which is the sinus infections and different things you know and he turned around told me he said i know about all these other things you got on here and he said we just have to put them on the list well it struck me i didn't get exactly what he was meaning and he said you know what i mean we're going to talk to god it's okay a good doctor that's okay went to a chiropractor the other day because they're having a problem with my neck they don't want to turn you know he got a good life when i told him i said it's not my head hurting it's my neck and i said the wife is the neck he lied back in the other room because you know the turning the neck wasn't throwing off on her was just funny cause i i live that kind of life i'm happy i'll go in doctor i think i'm dying what do you think i'm happy go ahead brother remember tuesday they're not sure what they're looking at right and this 3d procedure that to do gives picture perfect look at it right and uh i'm praying that there's not any reason that's what we're all praying and believing it danny's been through that so he can pray for you right i'm going to believe everything's going to be all right don't you because we believe it but god is the healer hallelujah he's a healer he's a deliverer he's the all in all and jesus is his name you love him sorry for being a little empty this evening but just remember that remember weighing them on the way home but just think about it the great eternal god is condescending down to man to save the man how beautiful a story we had the plan of redemption when we talked about it in the methodist the baptist the presbyterian the pentecostals what did it wind up being a good thoughts and ideas but now we're down to the basis that we can look into the scriptures and see god's plan and purpose write in the scripture and then look back and see it unfolding around us right that's wonderful happy about it i don't know about you i'm happy lord jesus thank you we pray that what we've said today has been enough and worthy enough to help us to understand help me too lord because i know that there's an ever partaking of the eternal revelation coming from almighty god and we pray that you'd bless and guide the people on the way home take care of everybody give a safe trip be with brother fraser their lord and touch him father and just we with weighing them on the way home be with all the people here as they travel back home today we love you and we thank you in jesus name amen you're dismissed pray one for in a another day you
