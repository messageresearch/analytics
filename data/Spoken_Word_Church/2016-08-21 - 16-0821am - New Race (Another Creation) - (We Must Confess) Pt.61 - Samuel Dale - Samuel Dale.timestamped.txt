[22:20] of th understanding in Jesus name
[22:26] amen Revelations
[22:29] 3:14 and un the angel of the Church of
[22:32] the lady ofans
[22:34] right these things sayth the amen the
[22:36] faithful and true witness the beginning
[22:39] of the creation of God as I always say
[22:42] he was the beginning the prophet says we
[22:44] are the rest of that creation all right
[22:47] let's go to Romans 8 and I want to read
[22:51] this for our thought for today and we'll
[22:55] go to verse 24 through 27 and then drop
[22:59] down to 34
[23:02] okay now listen to the reading of the
[23:04] scripture and you'll see how it ties
[23:05] into the message and what we're talking
[23:07] about for we are saved by hope now
[23:10] that's not I hope I'm saved that's right
[23:13] that's not it that hope is a word faith
[23:15] it's not uh you know but look but hope
[23:20] that is seen is not hope what is it it's
[23:23] a substance which is what faith is Right
[23:27] For What man
[23:28] seeth why does he yet hold for it if you
[23:31] see it you say well well I I need a I
[23:34] need a new suit now I got a suit
[23:37] on it's a reality it's it's a substance
[23:40] all right but if we hope now
[23:44] listen for that we see
[23:47] not is not a reality
[23:50] yet but it's a faith all right what do
[23:54] we
[23:56] do then do we with with patience wait
[23:59] for
[24:00] it
[24:02] what not just by ourselves it's not to
[24:04] that point God doesn't just leave us
[24:06] when we make a confession but listen to
[24:09] what he says likewise the spirit also
[24:11] helpeth our infirmities right right for
[24:15] we know not what we should pray for as
[24:18] we
[24:19] ought but the spirit
[24:21] itself maketh intercession for us with
[24:25] groanings which cannot be uttered
[24:29] and he that searches the heart knoweth
[24:32] what is the mind of the
[24:35] spirit because he maketh intercession
[24:38] for the Saints according to the will of
[24:41] God now where did he go to and what's he
[24:43] do in verse
[24:44] 34 who is he that
[24:48] condemneth it is Christ that died y
[24:51] brother is risen again who is even at
[24:55] the right hand of God who also maketh
[24:59] intercession for us you may be seated
[25:02] glad his Blessing to the reading of the
[25:05] word
[25:06] now what we're going to be talking
[25:10] about to today on both services will tie
[25:13] together but we may just do the other
[25:15] and we if I finish up we'll try to have
[25:19] questions and answers Wednesday okay and
[25:22] you just write down your questions and
[25:24] things or comments and we'll try to do
[25:26] that Wednesday if if I don't finish I'll
[25:29] announce it this evening it's according
[25:31] to how far I get along because I gave
[25:33] them a 25 quotes Okay for this one part
[25:38] but now listen we read there that
[25:41] he makes
[25:45] intercession all right now he makes
[25:51] intercession and see intercession is to
[25:55] intercede right for one you know all
[26:00] right now we're going to be talking
[26:03] about that we must
[26:06] confess that's right and the point is we
[26:10] must confess our position amen right
[26:14] that's
[26:15] right now we'll get to that and we'll
[26:18] you'll understand
[26:21] see because if we won't confess what we
[26:25] are right
[26:28] then we won't be able to confess where
[26:30] we're
[26:32] at and by that we don't know what to
[26:38] expect right now the world
[26:42] says and confesses that we're at the end
[26:45] of the world I mean the whole world
[26:46] systems
[26:48] right but do you think that is a
[26:51] revelation or just a
[26:56] statement all right so now we're going
[26:59] to be talking
[27:00] about that he maketh
[27:04] intercession Upon Our confession that's
[27:08] right now to confess is the same word as
[27:11] possess or profess and confession is the
[27:14] same
[27:15] word but confess is to say the same
[27:19] thing as another other words agree with
[27:23] it or or you know profess means like to
[27:27] declare openly right you know in your
[27:30] profession and confession is the same
[27:33] word okay now there's going to be a lot
[27:37] of scriptures and a lot of things said
[27:39] so I want you to keep that thought in
[27:41] your
[27:44] mind now there is future to some
[27:50] things right there was a pist has been a
[27:54] pist of things that we come through it
[27:57] and there is a the future of things or
[27:59] are the there are things that have not
[28:02] come to pass
[28:05] yet but what I want you to think
[28:09] about there is not a thing that has
[28:13] happened or a thing that is
[28:16] happening or a thing that will ever
[28:22] happen that was not
[28:26] confessed or statement of
[28:30] someone because that's the Bible is
[28:32] written all right he made known the
[28:36] secrets to the
[28:37] prophets and they spoke the word right
[28:41] so then no matter if you're thinking
[28:43] about the past are you thinking about
[28:45] the present or you thinking about the
[28:47] future remember it has already been
[28:51] spoken it was in God's word this
[28:55] afternoon we'll deal more with
[28:59] believing God's word amen all right
[29:03] believing God's word and thinking about
[29:06] it why we must believe
[29:08] it all
[29:11] right and then must confess
[29:14] it
[29:17] remember if he
[29:19] makes intercession as we've
[29:22] read upon our
[29:26] confession then our
[29:28] confession must be the right
[29:31] confession right now we'll be dealing
[29:35] with healing salvation
[29:38] whatever and if we put it on a basis now
[29:40] watch a
[29:42] confession we can say oh I believe I'm
[29:45] Healed I believe I'm saved but I don't
[29:49] know
[29:51] now what kind of a confession is
[29:55] that you know if c c certain thing took
[30:00] place you know I would
[30:03] know no if certain things took place
[30:06] that's a
[30:07] fact that's why we read in
[30:10] Romans why pray for something that you
[30:13] already have
[30:16] amen well you don't believe in praying
[30:19] now get that off your mind and garbage
[30:21] can and listen to what
[30:26] said but I believe in confessing more
[30:29] than I do praying yes amen
[30:33] absolutely because you can do I'll read
[30:35] it to you in a minute where the Prophet
[30:36] will tell you that's right you're not
[30:38] saved by your
[30:41] praying now come on FKS get it off your
[30:45] you know everybody wants to be picky
[30:46] picky picky and then you say something
[30:48] and they oh he don't understand get that
[30:50] off your your
[30:52] uh mind and listen and think about it
[30:59] see we know the word confess and pro
[31:02] profess is the same word we'll be
[31:04] reading some of
[31:05] that but the main thing I want you to
[31:08] think
[31:11] about that if he
[31:16] is making
[31:20] intercession what is it about or what is
[31:24] it and the Bible says he make an
[31:26] intercession what that's right Upon Our
[31:30] that's right confession that's right all
[31:32] right now God will do
[31:35] nothing what
[31:36] now until he Reveals His
[31:39] word amen right so that's what I said
[31:42] pie present future whatever it's all
[31:46] dealing with his revealing his word and
[31:49] what does he do he first does
[31:52] it then he reveals
[31:55] it what's now and then he makes it
[31:59] manifest so that's the way the word of
[32:02] God has always been and that's how the
[32:04] world was framed
[32:07] right we've read the word what and it
[32:09] says the world was framed by the word of
[32:12] God Amen all right do you know what that
[32:15] meant that meant God had to speak the
[32:19] word right not just well it it happen
[32:22] cuz he was God and no no no he spoke it
[32:28] amen and he believed
[32:31] it and would you like a quote like this
[32:34] where run around and said one day he
[32:36] said we're talking about a God that
[32:37] believes his own
[32:39] word you ever thought about that a God
[32:41] that believes his own word that's right
[32:43] amen well you know he shouldn't have any
[32:46] problem whether he says it or you say
[32:49] it
[32:51] right well he didn't say that the way I
[32:53] meant it well didn't evidently you
[32:55] didn't say it the way he meant it
[32:57] cuz you're not saying the same thing he
[33:00] says
[33:02] right you're making a
[33:05] confession but you're putting something
[33:07] with your
[33:09] confession that will cause you to lose
[33:11] your
[33:14] confession you realize you can be prayed
[33:16] for and be
[33:19] healed cancer anything you know and the
[33:23] next
[33:24] day or shortly thereafter whatever you
[33:26] take it you know you would die maybe die
[33:29] with that cancer
[33:31] why cuz you lost your
[33:33] confession right right now I've been
[33:36] over this will you and will you and with
[33:38] you for years and years trying to get a
[33:39] point to
[33:41] us and you know it's true you go to the
[33:44] doctor you're doing pretty good you're
[33:47] hurting you're having problems
[33:49] especially now you know we go to the
[33:51] Internet we look up and see what this is
[33:53] if it says you hurt right here you got a
[33:55] problem here it's generally this or that
[33:56] or the other you know we do our own
[33:59] diagnosis or how you say it you know and
[34:02] we get it all figured out but then we
[34:04] figure out that well it might not be
[34:06] cancer cuz it can be anything
[34:08] else and we go into the doctor kind of
[34:11] feeling okay well you know the doctor's
[34:13] going to tell me today now that I've
[34:16] just got a Gorder of growth but it's not
[34:22] malignant
[34:24] what see then when we go in in and the
[34:28] doctor tells us said that tumor that Etc
[34:33] that what you have the growth is cancer
[34:38] what
[34:39] happens you fall
[34:42] apart right you fall
[34:47] apart well everybody else in the country
[34:49] has done told you you had
[34:51] it why didn't you fall apart cuz this is
[34:55] a guy with medical training training or
[34:57] or uh diagnosis or or uh you know
[35:02] biopsies or whatever that he has
[35:06] determined that you have
[35:08] cancer all right when you fall
[35:13] apart
[35:15] right then you come back and you begin
[35:17] to
[35:20] think
[35:22] well they have diagnosed me with cancer
[35:26] and they said that it was you know
[35:30] lifethreatening it's this that or the
[35:32] other you know what I'm talking
[35:36] about well what is the difference in
[35:38] your faith when they tell you one thing
[35:39] and when they tell you
[35:43] another when they told me that I had
[35:47] leukemia they took a growth off they
[35:49] tested they done everything they came
[35:51] back with the point of
[35:55] leukemia
[35:58] well when I went in and they told me
[35:59] that that's what it was see they didn't
[36:01] tell me all the whole story because they
[36:03] hadn't figured it all out
[36:05] yet they said we want you to go over to
[36:08] a cancer
[36:10] doctor
[36:12] right and he comes in and the first
[36:15] thing he says he looks at me and I'm not
[36:17] going to tell you what to do or whatever
[36:19] not to do but he said Sam he says you
[36:23] have
[36:24] leukemia I said hold it before we start
[36:26] start any further we got one statement
[36:29] to make
[36:31] here that didn't throw me it didn't send
[36:34] me into shock and all kind of
[36:37] things I said we got one statement to
[36:39] make you ain't going to give me no
[36:41] chemotherapy I'll do anything else you
[36:43] got medically Etc that doesn't affect me
[36:47] in a lot of ways but I will not do
[36:51] that well I had to UNT told the doctor
[36:54] before he sent me to the cancer
[36:55] specialist I had done told him that he
[36:58] tried to convince me by saying that
[37:00] there's more modern stuff today more
[37:02] than this I said it's okay okay I got no
[37:05] problem number two doctor he says cuz
[37:08] that's what he said he said you got
[37:10] leukemia
[37:12] okay I said I'll do what you will tell
[37:15] me to do and do anything in the world
[37:16] that can help or
[37:18] whatever but I won't do
[37:20] yukimo I said you're sitting on that
[37:22] side of the table I'm on this side of
[37:23] the table told one of the doctors
[37:27] I said you Doctor him and I bury
[37:30] him that's just plain as because they
[37:33] knew I was a minister I said you you
[37:35] Doctor him you know and I bury him and I
[37:39] said you know what the things of the
[37:41] treatments and all like this is I'm
[37:43] getting to a point the doctor then he
[37:46] says well Sam I got good news for you I
[37:49] said well
[37:50] great he said you got the kind of cancer
[37:54] leukemia that you'll die with not die of
[37:57] he said there's two different kinds of
[37:59] leukemia he said one of them is a
[38:01] drastic death for certain almost the
[38:04] other one
[38:05] is that it's in your body
[38:10] okay see my point was that I had no
[38:14] problems when the doctor told me that
[38:16] time he going to take my kneecap
[38:18] off and that I had crippling arthritis I
[38:21] look back at him in life I said you
[38:23] won't do
[38:25] that well I still got my
[38:30] knees but you know what I'm saying you
[38:32] can start with that kind of faith I'm
[38:34] making it drastic in the
[38:37] state you can start with that kind of
[38:40] Faith but if along the way you lose it
[38:43] what have you
[38:46] done well it wasn't a revelation now
[38:48] wait a minute now you going to go back
[38:50] to your Prophet now and argue with
[38:53] him he said you can be healed that must
[38:57] be a
[38:58] revelation
[39:01] right of cancer today and die of it
[39:04] tomorrow that's
[39:07] right and what do we do we lose our
[39:10] confession he
[39:16] says well see I want to approach it on
[39:19] the basis of and we'll read these things
[39:22] as we're going along but I want to
[39:24] approach it on the basis of you thinking
[39:30] about
[39:34] confessing and how that's related to
[39:40] possessing cuz if it's really
[39:43] possessing it'll work
[39:46] y if not you know what happens after a
[39:49] while you go in as I said and and you
[39:52] the doctor tells you and he says you got
[39:54] cancer you come back here or where
[39:56] wherever and whatever you do it and you
[39:58] start a a a form of positive confession
[40:01] which is wonderful the doctor will tell
[40:04] you Dr uh Brother Gary Atkins dad told
[40:08] me he said you know if you can just get
[40:11] people to believe he said that's
[40:15] 50% 50% at least of it I think he said
[40:19] when he went to the to his first um you
[40:22] know teaching in the medical realm they
[40:25] told him said if you won't hinder your
[40:27] patience that 80% of them going to get
[40:29] well I think that was the statement he
[40:32] made but Dr Atkins was a man of Faith to
[40:36] believe he'll tell you about a case of a
[40:38] lady that uh and he said we never
[40:40] operate till we pray and I like those
[40:43] things but he told about told me about a
[40:45] lady that uh had been diagnosed with
[40:48] terminal cancer no hopes whatsoever and
[40:51] he said we were treating her the best we
[40:53] could do and said you know what she got
[40:55] well when well years later they come to
[40:57] him and they upgrade these things and
[40:59] want to know kind of what happened to
[41:01] this case something like that and they
[41:04] was asking him and he said the the lady
[41:06] got
[41:08] well well the the doctors you know they
[41:11] were amazed they wanted to know what
[41:12] happened how did she die what did how
[41:15] long did it take what did it do you he
[41:17] said the lady got
[41:20] well all right those are positive
[41:25] points but what we're going to be tying
[41:27] together is two things salvation which
[41:29] is really the word Sozo which means
[41:32] physical or spiritual so that'll be the
[41:34] same word so it'll be in dealing with
[41:36] healing or dealing with
[41:39] salvation all right now I do not
[41:42] believe so you could be healed today and
[41:45] die tomorrow right but we do not believe
[41:48] in really the possession of Salvation as
[41:51] a new birth and then being able to lose
[41:53] that now that's number one flat up front
[41:56] but if you're dealing with justification
[41:59] sanctification and in those Realms of
[42:01] your Christian experience you can be
[42:04] saved today and lost tomorrow right amen
[42:09] all right did you follow that one now
[42:11] amen if it's just justification if it's
[42:13] just believing you can lose your
[42:15] believing but if your believing becomes
[42:17] a reality of eternal life you can never
[42:20] lose eternal life so solve that we're
[42:22] out of that to start with and when we
[42:24] come through the message then you
[42:25] remember that statement I'll probably
[42:27] make it many times but what about him
[42:32] now he's making
[42:39] intercession and it's up
[42:42] on your
[42:46] confession now think on these things as
[42:50] we bring some
[42:51] scriptures and to think about it so go
[42:55] ahead and pull up
[42:57] number one a we just bring some
[43:00] scriptures and think about what the
[43:02] scriptures really saying Isaiah 53 and12
[43:06] tells how he was you know he has poured
[43:09] out his soul into death he was numbered
[43:11] with transgressors and he B the sin of
[43:14] many and made
[43:17] intercession for the
[43:20] transgressors now made
[43:23] intercession intercession is one who
[43:27] intercedes for another that's right all
[43:30] right made
[43:32] intercession that's in the Old Testament
[43:35] right bring it down go to the next
[43:36] Romans 8:26 that we just
[43:41] read we got to go to 1 b b 2 B well 1 b
[43:47] 1 a 1 B okay verse 26 likewise the
[43:52] spirit also help with our infirmities
[43:54] for we know what we should know not what
[43:57] we should pray for as we ought but the
[44:00] spirit itself maketh intercession for us
[44:08] Amen in other words he's making
[44:11] intercession because we're going to see
[44:12] in a minute he's the high priest of our
[44:16] confession right but now where's he at
[44:18] we're going to see that he's at the
[44:20] right hand of the father making
[44:23] intercession the body is still laying
[44:25] there at the present time right not a
[44:30] body dead body laying on Throne no
[44:34] no his body was given as a
[44:40] sacrifice and there's your high
[44:43] priest right now remember a high priest
[44:46] listen to the wording now a high priest
[44:49] is not the um the
[44:54] god he's one between you and
[44:58] God we're firm Believers in not a
[45:01] trinitarian Doctrine but God in three
[45:03] manifestations amen three
[45:06] attributes that way he can be our savior
[45:09] our healer our deliverer and all things
[45:11] and that way he could give his
[45:14] life right
[45:16] amen whereas God we would talk about and
[45:20] people are say my God can't die well
[45:22] we're not talking about God dying we're
[45:24] talking about what he done to make
[45:27] things work in the way that it's
[45:29] supposed to be but now watch as we read
[45:31] on in the
[45:33] scripture all right go to 1 C which is
[45:35] Roman 8:34 that we we
[45:39] read but I gave this A B C D and then we
[45:43] drop back I mean a b c and then we drop
[45:45] back to one okay you know what that is I
[45:48] I cut and paste okay I had these things
[45:50] in and instead of being so smart as
[45:52] y'all are to move this over here and
[45:53] that over there I just cut it and tape
[45:55] it and put it in there and I label it
[45:57] instead of putting it numbers I put one
[45:59] a 1 b 1 C then I start back over the one
[46:03] I a it's hard as smart as y'all are but
[46:05] I get it done okay Romans 8:34 who is he
[46:09] that condemneth it is Christ that died
[46:12] yeah rather that is risen who is even at
[46:15] the right hand of
[46:18] God who also maketh intercession for
[46:22] us
[46:24] now let's don't be calm
[46:26] caral well let's be carnal enough that's
[46:30] my point A lot of people are so
[46:32] spiritually minded they ain't worth a
[46:33] toot as far as
[46:35] carnality
[46:38] right not referring to it as
[46:40] Christianity but they said Einstein
[46:42] couldn't even tie his own
[46:44] shoes I guess he wore
[46:46] slipon he was too smart he couldn't
[46:49] cross the highway he couldn't figure out
[46:51] how to get between
[46:52] cars that's what you call being such
[46:54] smart you're dumb
[46:56] all right see then the point is what you
[47:00] can be so spiritually minded you're no
[47:03] good in carnality or natural life but
[47:06] you can also be so carnal until you
[47:10] you're not worth anything in spiritual
[47:12] life all right so we got to find the
[47:14] middle of the road right something that
[47:18] we can think about and then we think
[47:20] about the
[47:23] scriptures we think about the scriptures
[47:25] of what it's
[47:29] saying he maketh intercession for
[47:35] us
[47:37] now that's the point I want you to look
[47:40] at as I said it's not a body laying up
[47:43] there there that's the atonement right
[47:45] there no that's our
[47:50] carnalities but that body was
[47:54] made as an intercessor that's right
[47:58] that's why the Bible said God was in
[48:00] Christ reconciling the world un himself
[48:02] the body was created brought to pass for
[48:04] the part of intercession amen all right
[48:08] now see then he's not just laying
[48:11] there but you know he's got a
[48:14] job ever thought about what God is
[48:19] doing you don't ever think about
[48:23] that there's millions of people in the
[48:25] world today and each one is praying
[48:27] maybe and yet he hears every one of them
[48:31] records every one of
[48:32] them and he's there to make an atonement
[48:34] for every one of them right or else what
[48:38] happen to your God see right okay just
[48:43] getting a point I know I won't get to
[48:44] all these scriptures in this
[48:47] morning but he is what now go ahead
[48:50] we'll pick up number one now which is
[48:52] Hebrews
[48:54] 31
[48:58] wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the
[49:01] Heavenly calling consider the
[49:04] Apostle and high
[49:06] priest of our
[49:09] profession Jesus
[49:12] Christ now he's not only the high priest
[49:15] he's the Apostle the set her in order or
[49:17] to bring in the doing but he's the high
[49:21] priest that's his
[49:23] job you know what he's doing now high
[49:25] priest
[49:27] y right that's right I mean hey come on
[49:31] he didn't thr his thing away and go on
[49:33] vacation and comes back when we get to
[49:35] it the end of the
[49:37] world that's what I want you to think
[49:39] about I want you to get the reality into
[49:42] your mind of what's Happening that is
[49:44] not heaven just playing on Harps and
[49:47] floating around and
[49:50] doing there's things taking
[49:53] place and we read there where did he
[49:56] make us intercession with
[50:00] groanings we know what that
[50:03] is you got known and unknown tongues you
[50:05] got things happen that God can speak to
[50:08] you groaning professions uh you know
[50:12] confessions and that brother randam I
[50:13] remember him saying one day that he was
[50:15] praying and it just entered like into
[50:18] something I don't remember exactly the
[50:19] way he brought it but it entered into
[50:21] something well then just wouldn't very
[50:23] long after then that they brought this
[50:26] lady to his house or something like that
[50:30] and when they told him he said how long
[50:33] ago was it that y'all took her out of
[50:34] the car and that she was real
[50:39] sick he said something was within me
[50:42] calling
[50:44] out the spirit make it intercession now
[50:48] that's real it's not just a Hocus Pocus
[50:50] that's amen all
[50:53] right am but he's making he's the high
[50:56] priest but now what does a high priest
[51:00] do a high priest is the only one now
[51:03] we're talking about in God we're not
[51:05] talking about an individual bringing up
[51:07] and these priests and doing this and
[51:08] this and we're talking about the high
[51:10] priest the high priest is the one who
[51:13] makes the greatest atonement
[51:17] right he's making atonement for
[51:20] everybody not just an individual person
[51:23] but his atonement is making for
[51:24] everybody why cuz he's the high
[51:29] priest so then he got a job he's doing
[51:32] something that's what I want you to
[51:34] think about I want you to think about
[51:36] what's taking place now in heaven
[51:39] amen
[51:42] right do you realize in heaven there's
[51:45] altars the Bible speaks of
[51:48] it you realize now it's not up there
[51:50] bleeding and a bloody lamb and a dead
[51:53] body and no no get all that out of out
[51:55] of your garbage mind get down to
[51:58] sensible
[52:00] reality but there is a heaven
[52:04] right and in heaven there's a lot of
[52:06] things going
[52:09] on it come back to mind where brother
[52:11] Brandon was talking on I believe it's
[52:12] the seventh seal but he said we're
[52:14] talking about tonight what took place in
[52:16] glory 2,000 years
[52:21] ago took
[52:23] place the lamb takes the
[52:26] book but things happen in heaven it's
[52:30] not just sitting up there nothing taking
[52:32] place right but remember whatever is
[52:36] being done he's the high
[52:39] priest
[52:41] right and he's making
[52:46] intercession of our
[52:49] profession profession and confessing is
[52:52] the same word okay y
[52:56] now think about it Hebrews 4:14 says
[53:00] seeing that then we have a great high
[53:04] priest that is passed into the
[53:08] heavens Jesus the son of God watch let
[53:13] us hold fast our profession amen
[53:20] right but if we don't know what's
[53:22] happening in heaven how can we hold fast
[53:24] our profession
[53:27] right well Heaven is just this just it's
[53:30] floating around or on clouds and just do
[53:37] it all right but you're not going to get
[53:39] the point of what I'm driving at
[53:46] either he's there right
[53:49] now interceding for you and
[53:53] I amen we think it as a well it happen
[53:57] one time way back under and it's all
[53:59] over with and we're you know they're
[54:00] just there's up our um you know we got
[54:04] it about like we used to have about the
[54:07] uh remember I remember this was kind of
[54:08] in my school years and that's a long
[54:10] time ago but and I didn't spend a lot of
[54:12] them but two you know they told you that
[54:16] you ever heard the old story back when
[54:17] it was kids that what Thunder
[54:20] was that was Zeus and Thor and a couple
[54:23] of them rolling bowling balls
[54:25] down through there and striking the
[54:26] bowling ball pins you
[54:28] know well we laugh at that and say well
[54:31] that's dumb well that's the way we think
[54:33] about heaven today is
[54:36] dumb we don't think about it as a
[54:43] reality now come
[54:46] on like I said we have 7 billion people
[54:51] in the world today and if they were
[54:53] everybody would be praying you know
[54:55] really honest everything right there'd
[54:58] be 7 billion conversations going to
[55:03] heaven and you know what he's
[55:06] doing he's sitting there and say I heard
[55:09] this one I heard that one I heard this
[55:12] one I heard that one I heard that one
[55:15] and if everyone true he would have S
[55:17] billion conversations or prayer lines or
[55:21] whatever you want to call
[55:22] it you said well that's just impossible
[55:24] do they no that's where our human minds
[55:26] are thinking remember Heaven is
[55:32] eternity but brother Dale I thought he'
[55:34] just done it one time ours where your
[55:36] trouble's at
[55:39] right you thought it was done at Calvary
[55:41] thought it was finished amen that's
[55:45] true but what's he been doing since
[55:50] then according to the Bible he's making
[55:52] intercession Upon Our profession right
[55:54] right
[55:55] according to the Bible he's the high
[55:56] priest according to the Bible he's on
[55:58] the
[56:01] throne so now we know for a certainty
[56:04] let's do it this way we know for a
[56:06] certainty that 7 billion people are not
[56:08] real
[56:09] Christians so he a I want to get this
[56:12] where you can listen so 7 billion people
[56:15] he ain't having to listen to
[56:18] them it's about 6 and a half billion he
[56:21] ain't even paying no attention
[56:23] to right
[56:27] come on folks we we don't think
[56:31] rightly according to the Bible and you
[56:33] get over the Book of Revelation that the
[56:35] prayers of the Saints is holding in
[56:38] a
[56:40] bowl and pouring out and that makes
[56:43] tribulation happen to the whole
[56:45] world because of your prayers that are
[56:47] poured
[56:49] out we don't think of the Bible as being
[56:53] real we don't think of it as being a
[56:56] reality of
[56:59] life that's why we don't get the point
[57:01] of who God is and what he's doing well
[57:04] he just a spirit just floating
[57:09] around for 6,000 years he just been
[57:11] goofing off cuz he done it before the
[57:15] world that's where I love your prophet
[57:17] in the way he
[57:18] speaks and when that struck me it just
[57:21] burned into my heart when he said even
[57:24] after all of the sin of
[57:26] mankind he said God didn't step in
[57:30] heaven said he come down to live with
[57:35] his people right if that don't strike
[57:38] you then there something wrong then okay
[57:40] what is that Aaron always bring if I
[57:42] don't do your cup something something
[57:45] not turned over whatever
[57:48] okay but
[57:52] listen Hebrews 10 and 23 three
[57:56] says let us hold fight to profession of
[58:00] our
[58:01] faith now here doesn't mention it right
[58:05] God is just saying let us hold fast our
[58:08] profession now look what he's bringing
[58:10] it to let us hold fast to profession of
[58:13] our faith watch without
[58:17] wavering for he's faithful that promised
[58:22] now what does it mean to whole F your
[58:23] profession
[58:30] when you think about hopei your
[58:36] profession okay go ahead to number
[58:42] four let's read what your Prophet said
[58:44] on
[58:45] Hebrews uh chapter 4 paragraph
[58:50] 26 Jesus Christ let's whole F our
[58:53] profession hold
[58:57] fast that don't
[58:59] mean just keep
[59:06] testifying
[59:09] no you got to the doctor the doctor said
[59:11] cancer it blooped you in you just lost
[59:14] your thoughts about what you thought
[59:16] confess mean holding fast your
[59:18] Perfection What when a prophet is
[59:20] telling you what takes
[59:23] place now he telling you not to
[59:25] testify no no no
[59:30] no that's
[59:32] right he's telling you in simple
[59:34] language because we read it and he calls
[59:36] you a
[59:37] hypocrite to think that you just keep
[59:40] confessing that's what I said that's
[59:42] what's wrong with the people they go to
[59:44] the doctor they come back and they say I
[59:47] Believe by stries I'm
[59:50] Healed and I keep confessing it that's
[59:53] wonderful we got to do that
[59:56] that but then after a while what
[59:59] happens you start getting sicker and
[1:00:03] weaker and after a while you start
[1:00:06] coming out with
[1:00:09] thoughts you'll say you know I may die
[1:00:12] this but but God put this on me to where
[1:00:15] that they could run test and find out
[1:00:18] some way to cure cancer now God ain't
[1:00:20] never done nothing like that that's
[1:00:21] right see that's our negative points
[1:00:25] of trying to justify the fact that we
[1:00:27] don't believe that's
[1:00:29] right why not just keep on walking and
[1:00:32] say I believe it
[1:00:34] right that's better now he in no way is
[1:00:37] your Prophet saying don't keep on
[1:00:39] testifying what's he
[1:00:42] saying if your testimony is not
[1:00:44] according to your life what are you come
[1:00:46] on May I
[1:00:48] quote your life is so loud I can't hear
[1:00:50] your
[1:00:51] words right something to that degree so
[1:00:55] listen hold fast that don't mean just
[1:00:58] keep
[1:01:00] testifying if you don't live the
[1:01:02] life you don't hold it
[1:01:05] fast you're living a hypocritical
[1:01:09] thing watch what he said you'd better be
[1:01:13] on out and just in other words that it'd
[1:01:16] be better for you to just what be on out
[1:01:20] and just say you're a
[1:01:22] sinner and forget about it y other words
[1:01:25] you'd be better to just go be a sinner
[1:01:27] and forget
[1:01:29] about yeah well he's telling me go be a
[1:01:31] sinner no he's not telling you go be a
[1:01:34] sinner he's telling you if you're going
[1:01:36] to live like the devil just be the
[1:01:39] devil right don't confess something
[1:01:42] watch don't profess a
[1:01:46] Christian in other words live something
[1:01:48] else don't profess being a Christian and
[1:01:49] live something else you're the biggest
[1:01:52] stumbling block the world has ever had
[1:01:55] if you're a sinner admit it and go on
[1:01:57] get right with God if you're a Christian
[1:02:00] hold F you're confession stay there so
[1:02:02] now what's he
[1:02:04] saying he's in no way saying for you not
[1:02:06] to keep on
[1:02:08] testifying because he plainly tells you
[1:02:10] you must do
[1:02:12] that but if our lives don't fit our
[1:02:18] testimony right
[1:02:20] right I wouldn't have one that said it
[1:02:22] you talk to him about it
[1:02:24] if you don't confess being a
[1:02:30] Christian just live something
[1:02:34] else cuz he said that's a bigest
[1:02:36] stumbling
[1:02:40] block see to confess we're
[1:02:43] Christians we should walk like
[1:02:45] Christians right be like Christians
[1:02:49] right there's nothing wrong with saying
[1:02:52] you're sick I know people they got got
[1:02:54] the positive attitude and that's fine I
[1:02:56] agree with it too but the positive
[1:02:59] attitude is don't confess you got
[1:03:00] something then that means you don't got
[1:03:02] it but if you say you got it that means
[1:03:05] you took it that's a l to
[1:03:08] that I don't have one but you know a lot
[1:03:10] of people will not buy a cemetery
[1:03:13] lot reason I don't have one I just never
[1:03:16] thought about it never want to get one
[1:03:18] you know lot of people won't buy ceter
[1:03:19] lot you know
[1:03:22] why because in the mind of preachers has
[1:03:25] preached to you that if you're going to
[1:03:26] buy you a cemetery lot then you're
[1:03:28] admitting you're going to
[1:03:32] die what's that got to do with it
[1:03:35] tell right just oh we lived in the days
[1:03:40] when it was all great didn't it I'm
[1:03:42] talking about in this message coming
[1:03:43] down oh we don't have no insurance and
[1:03:45] we don't pay no taxes and we don't pay
[1:03:46] noay no social security cuz we going to
[1:03:48] need it we're going in Rapture now buch
[1:03:50] of bums around the country having to
[1:03:51] live off the families and everything
[1:03:53] else
[1:03:55] you don't like that but is it
[1:03:58] true I paid mine went on down forgot it
[1:04:02] but Sons and Daughters of a king don't
[1:04:05] pay taxes well they run into the wrong
[1:04:07] guy to try to quote that too because I
[1:04:09] can quote too I can quote where Jesus
[1:04:13] went and paid taxes he
[1:04:15] wasn't just a king or a son of a king he
[1:04:18] was almighty God and he said render
[1:04:20] under Caesar the things that are Caesars
[1:04:22] but under God the things that are God
[1:04:24] Peter here go down and get the money out
[1:04:26] and pay taxes for you and
[1:04:30] me but you see we get all of that great
[1:04:33] mind build
[1:04:36] up and what's God having to
[1:04:41] confess listen what you say you are is
[1:04:45] what you
[1:04:48] are
[1:04:50] right what you say you are is what you
[1:04:53] are
[1:04:58] if you're a Christian you say what the
[1:04:59] word says about
[1:05:02] you
[1:05:05] right sir you know why you do
[1:05:09] that now I try to make it silly where
[1:05:12] you listen to what I'm talking
[1:05:14] about God's not setting up there Jesus
[1:05:16] Christ is not sitting there and one day
[1:05:18] you say he's a Christian he said he's
[1:05:19] doing pretty good I give him an ex next
[1:05:22] day he says well I ain't no Christian
[1:05:24] raise that
[1:05:27] now but you know that is pretty
[1:05:31] close because remember he's making
[1:05:34] intercession upon what you
[1:05:38] confess that's
[1:05:41] right
[1:05:43] right now we all know the story but
[1:05:45] let's read the story go to number five
[1:05:47] Romans Romans 10 let's read the story
[1:05:50] that we've all been through I heard this
[1:05:52] scripture read so much in the Baptist
[1:05:53] Church I used to I didn't like
[1:05:57] it so I read I'm honest I didn't like to
[1:06:01] read that
[1:06:05] scripture right cuz that's all they
[1:06:07] wants you to do get up come up be prayed
[1:06:11] for believe in your heart yes I believe
[1:06:13] CU I'm standing here confess your yes
[1:06:15] I'm a Christian okay you're a member of
[1:06:17] the church candidate for
[1:06:21] baptism and then go live like the devil
[1:06:24] well they got saved I was there when
[1:06:27] they got
[1:06:29] saved you think it didn't happen in
[1:06:31] Pentecostal had a lady tell me one time
[1:06:34] she said I was there when my children
[1:06:36] received the Holy Ghost and spoke in
[1:06:42] tongues I got enough of it after a while
[1:06:44] and I said I don't believe the one
[1:06:47] you're talking about got
[1:06:53] it
[1:06:55] I she wouldn't be living like she's
[1:06:59] living you know what she finally
[1:07:01] admitted so well I guess you're right
[1:07:03] but see our first point was a great
[1:07:05] uplift that I was there when my children
[1:07:07] spoke in tongues so I know they're
[1:07:10] saved oh come on folks we've been in the
[1:07:12] Baptist long
[1:07:15] enough in the Baptist it didn't make no
[1:07:17] difference long as you went up and
[1:07:19] believed and was baptized
[1:07:21] and you can just go do what you wanted
[1:07:23] to
[1:07:24] well I was there when he was saved his
[1:07:26] name's on our book yeah are you going to
[1:07:29] tell him he ain't
[1:07:33] saved that's when I got into trouble
[1:07:35] with the brother
[1:07:36] remember brother was telling me he saved
[1:07:38] I said you don't act like you're acting
[1:07:40] if you're saved he went off and told
[1:07:42] everybody I said he wouldn't save I
[1:07:43] didn't say he wouldn't
[1:07:45] say I told him he was saying he wouldn't
[1:07:47] save because he's acting like
[1:07:50] it
[1:07:51] okay but now look
[1:07:55] other words what saith Faith what
[1:07:59] saith the word is na thee even thy mouth
[1:08:03] thy heart that is the word of
[1:08:08] faith which we
[1:08:11] preach
[1:08:13] now that's not meaning you understand
[1:08:16] everything but it's meaning you have an
[1:08:18] understanding that's right amen right
[1:08:21] that's right it's not meaning you
[1:08:22] understand everything but it means you
[1:08:23] have an understand understand it yes
[1:08:25] right okay now then think about it but
[1:08:27] if Thou shalt confess with thy
[1:08:30] mouth the Lord
[1:08:32] Jesus and Shall Believe in thine heart
[1:08:36] that God has raised him from the dead
[1:08:39] Thou shalt be
[1:08:40] saved that's right well how many times
[1:08:43] have you seen people say I believe and
[1:08:46] you know what they did sure are you
[1:08:48] going to tell me they didn't believe
[1:08:50] they believe Jesus Christ died and Rose
[1:08:56] and they believed he was living in their
[1:08:59] heart but yet something went wrong amen
[1:09:02] why let me ask you a question is it not
[1:09:06] right in the Bible terminologies that
[1:09:08] God doesn't repeat
[1:09:10] himself right you know why now I'm
[1:09:13] reading brother brownon so he just be
[1:09:15] but but see now there is things and
[1:09:18] brother Brown said it like this he said
[1:09:19] when God repeats himself you better
[1:09:21] listen so when it says ver early I say
[1:09:24] unto you he double stated it to make you
[1:09:28] listen that's right amen right if God
[1:09:31] does say things twice listen to what
[1:09:33] he's saying
[1:09:36] amen are you with me amen because he's
[1:09:40] double stating it to make it enter your
[1:09:43] mind and at least become a part of
[1:09:46] you cuz he doesn't repeat himself that's
[1:09:49] right he said something over here and
[1:09:52] he'll maybe never say it again
[1:09:55] right right we're going to be judged by
[1:09:58] what he said
[1:10:00] right now listen why did he make this
[1:10:03] statement
[1:10:04] again he's already told you if thou
[1:10:08] confess with thy
[1:10:09] mouth the Lord
[1:10:12] Jesus will you confess with your M yes I
[1:10:15] believe it the Lord Jesus died for my
[1:10:17] sin I'm not making light I'm telling you
[1:10:19] what happens
[1:10:21] sure and I believe in my heart that God
[1:10:24] raised him up from the
[1:10:29] dead now Paul's going to put a statement
[1:10:32] on there for you to listen to and you'll
[1:10:34] see why that I hated the scripture I
[1:10:37] don't mean hated it I just didn't like
[1:10:38] to read it cuz I knew had been
[1:10:40] used until it become a reality in my own
[1:10:43] life after being in this message for two
[1:10:46] years and seeking the baptism of the
[1:10:48] Holy Ghost this scripture came a
[1:10:52] lot all I got to do is do
[1:11:04] this do you understand what I just done
[1:11:06] I'm saying take that part out of that
[1:11:08] where it says
[1:11:11] far and you just be
[1:11:13] repeating again the
[1:11:19] statement but when he says
[1:11:22] far this
[1:11:24] means something I'm going to express to
[1:11:27] you now of what this happens up
[1:11:31] here and I want you to follow that into
[1:11:35] your
[1:11:37] thinking
[1:11:38] look for in other words hold on to it
[1:11:42] I'm explaining
[1:11:44] it for with the heart man believeth unto
[1:11:50] righteousness it's a repeat but is we
[1:11:53] different wording watch and with the
[1:11:55] mouth confession is made under
[1:11:59] salvation he's explaining what takes
[1:12:02] place of you believing
[1:12:04] it and then you're confessing
[1:12:08] it right it's not just a point of
[1:12:11] repeating the same that's
[1:12:14] right it makes it a reality into your
[1:12:18] life I like the story you know that was
[1:12:21] told cuz I well lived in there
[1:12:24] of all of them got up the altar you know
[1:12:25] and all the kids and everyone in there
[1:12:27] got up and tell what the Lord done for
[1:12:29] you tell what the Lord done for you each
[1:12:31] one of them got up said Lord Save Me
[1:12:32] Lord save me one little boy got up said
[1:12:34] what he do for you he's ain't done
[1:12:35] nothing
[1:12:37] yet well I don't mean it wrong cuz I'm
[1:12:39] just telling you he's probably the only
[1:12:40] one that answered
[1:12:42] right
[1:12:44] right at least he wasn't going to take
[1:12:47] it on that I've seen things I've been
[1:12:50] you know the Lord I've told you about
[1:12:51] the things I've seen in my life and what
[1:12:53] being before I become a Christian and
[1:12:56] the thoughts that I had in my mind but
[1:12:59] at 18 years of
[1:13:01] age when they tried to get me to the
[1:13:05] Altar and that's all you good old
[1:13:08] Baptist wants to do is he get you all to
[1:13:09] make a confession make a joining
[1:13:14] right but when they told me he said you
[1:13:16] did that or I said I live a better life
[1:13:19] than your Deacon board does now you want
[1:13:20] me to tell you why I'm saying that I
[1:13:23] don't mean you today I mean I was saying
[1:13:25] it to them I said you want me to tell
[1:13:29] you words you want me to explain to you
[1:13:33] why I say I'm living a better life than
[1:13:34] your Deacon board cuz I could do
[1:13:38] it so I didn't believe in being a
[1:13:40] hypocrite then and I certainly don't
[1:13:42] now my sister you've heard my story my
[1:13:45] sister came to me and my brother-in-law
[1:13:48] had just got killed in a car
[1:13:49] wreck and my sister came to me and she
[1:13:52] said Sam you know that JC's in hell that
[1:13:56] was her husband that he's in hell today
[1:13:58] cuz he didn't have a chance to
[1:14:01] repent and said you better repent and go
[1:14:03] to the
[1:14:05] altar I've told you the story I love my
[1:14:09] sisters I love my
[1:14:10] family but I had more respect for my
[1:14:15] brother-in-law than I did for my sister
[1:14:17] in the line of
[1:14:20] Christianity and yet I never seen him in
[1:14:22] church never seen
[1:14:26] anything I don't back up that's the
[1:14:30] truth but you see they wanted me to come
[1:14:32] to the altar they wanted me to make a
[1:14:37] confession and one day I walked up there
[1:14:40] of my own
[1:14:45] accord and I said
[1:14:47] Lord you got to get me over this I
[1:14:49] didn't know the wording I was using but
[1:14:52] brother Rand later said said he said
[1:14:54] sometimes we have to get over the church
[1:14:57] to be able to get to
[1:14:59] Christ something to that degree I didn't
[1:15:02] know the wordings to use but I just
[1:15:03] prayed I said
[1:15:05] Lord don't let me hold anything don't
[1:15:07] let them be a stumbling block in front
[1:15:09] of me as to bringing me to
[1:15:16] Salvation for five or six years I was a
[1:15:19] deacon in a Baptist Church at 23 years
[1:15:22] of age so you know they thought a lot of
[1:15:26] me but then when I saw this message I
[1:15:30] had to walk
[1:15:31] out what if I have
[1:15:36] stayed and made my
[1:15:41] confession that I've seen God I've seen
[1:15:43] this I've seen
[1:15:44] that there would have been nobody to
[1:15:46] listen to it cuz he would have no right
[1:15:48] to listen to
[1:15:50] it you see that's what I'm talking about
[1:15:53] about where brother brownon says don't
[1:15:55] just deal on the fact of you
[1:15:59] praying or even
[1:16:02] confessing he said got to be more than
[1:16:07] that and if the life is not live then
[1:16:10] forget the rest that's
[1:16:16] right oh boy I got in trouble with two
[1:16:18] brothers one time brother Brandon was
[1:16:20] making a statement one day and his
[1:16:22] statement was talking about drinking and
[1:16:24] he went on to say and he says it
[1:16:26] something to this degree he said frankly
[1:16:28] I wish you'd try it see where you like
[1:16:30] it or
[1:16:34] not boy man they got all over me he
[1:16:38] wasn't saying for you to drink I said I
[1:16:40] didn't say he was saying to
[1:16:43] drink he
[1:16:45] said he was simply meaning that the
[1:16:48] devil says
[1:16:51] that no the devil don't we she drank he
[1:16:55] knows you're going to do it
[1:16:56] anyway but it was a play of
[1:17:02] words my play of words was never to say
[1:17:04] that it was okay to drink I said because
[1:17:06] I'm the guy that didn't
[1:17:09] drink so you think I'd be telling kids
[1:17:11] to go drink when I never dranked in my
[1:17:17] life the first alcoholic beverage I took
[1:17:19] was communion in this
[1:17:22] message
[1:17:24] so you know that I'm not for
[1:17:27] drinking but neither is your Prophet
[1:17:29] just saying going back he's saying hey
[1:17:32] don't be a
[1:17:35] hypocrite
[1:17:38] okay don't be a stumbling
[1:17:40] block but to do what the word
[1:17:44] says far hold on think about
[1:17:48] it with your
[1:17:52] heart
[1:17:54] you're believing that's soul right not
[1:17:57] dumping gears at Heart
[1:18:00] Right for with The
[1:18:03] Soul Man
[1:18:06] believeth unto righteousness does mean
[1:18:09] it all come right there he's believing
[1:18:10] un true right if your confession ever
[1:18:14] stop you're not believing right and with
[1:18:17] the mouth confession is made under
[1:18:21] salvation what should be the confession
[1:18:23] out of the
[1:18:24] mouth what took place in the soul or
[1:18:27] heart if you want to read
[1:18:29] it that's why brother random would say
[1:18:31] and they said brother random should we
[1:18:33] go do this should we go do that since
[1:18:35] becoming a Christian he said go tell
[1:18:37] them how the candle got
[1:18:40] lit why cuz that's all you
[1:18:44] knew
[1:18:46] right but listen go ahead to number six
[1:18:49] we'll read a few of these then we'll
[1:18:51] take up this evening from the message
[1:18:53] the Church of the Living God preached in
[1:18:59] 51 now if you will accept now what he
[1:19:01] done for you then now he's the Hebrews 3
[1:19:05] and one he's the high priest of our
[1:19:07] confession now anyone who knows the
[1:19:10] scripture knows that that word is
[1:19:13] written
[1:19:14] profession but the same words translated
[1:19:19] confession all right in other words
[1:19:23] he cannot save you by the merits of your
[1:19:29] prayer now are we at it
[1:19:34] again the same way where he
[1:19:37] said whole fight to your profession is
[1:19:40] not just testifying all the time there's
[1:19:44] more to go with it it's not just save
[1:19:47] you by the merits of your
[1:19:49] prayers well I've said three prayers
[1:19:51] every day for the past 20 years here so
[1:19:53] I know I'm
[1:19:54] saved you can stay on your knees and
[1:19:56] never get off your knees for 3 years and
[1:19:59] pray all the 24 hours a day that
[1:20:01] wouldn't save
[1:20:02] you make a good person out of
[1:20:05] you
[1:20:07] listen he cannot save
[1:20:10] you by the merits of your enthusiasm y
[1:20:16] right are your good works y right so no
[1:20:20] matter how good you feel about it how
[1:20:22] much you shouted you spoke in tongue
[1:20:24] you've done everything right no matter
[1:20:26] how much you've give Paul said if I give
[1:20:28] my body to be
[1:20:30] burned right right he saves you by the
[1:20:36] merits of your faith and your
[1:20:42] confession stop it you say well he saved
[1:20:45] me by my
[1:20:47] faith you've only said half the story
[1:20:50] that's not what Paul said Paul said
[1:20:51] believe in your heart confess with your
[1:20:54] mouth right amen so we're going to read
[1:20:58] at a while when we get back to this
[1:20:59] evening where brother R said we got to
[1:21:00] go by the
[1:21:02] word all right so look he saves you by
[1:21:05] the merits of your faith and your
[1:21:08] confession for if you will confess me
[1:21:10] before men him will I confess before my
[1:21:14] father and the Holy Angels you remember
[1:21:17] the quote I gave you the other day where
[1:21:18] the lady said said I want to tell you
[1:21:20] something said I got the Holy Ghost but
[1:21:22] don't tell
[1:21:26] nobody now I can't go that way
[1:21:29] because the prophet that I follow says
[1:21:33] that it's like trying to put out a fire
[1:21:36] on a windy day
[1:21:39] right you saying that lady wasn't saved
[1:21:41] I didn't say that she said it
[1:21:44] herself God's making intercession upon
[1:21:46] her
[1:21:47] confession that's right cuz she took
[1:21:49] part of the word she took took the part
[1:21:52] of believe it in her heart but she never
[1:21:54] took the part of confessing it
[1:21:56] confessing is what living the life and
[1:21:59] going out and saying
[1:22:02] it like well brother Mo you know brother
[1:22:05] Mo probably was pretty mean guy in his
[1:22:07] life I like the way he said it he said
[1:22:11] when he come to the Lord said he went
[1:22:12] down in the road knocking on the
[1:22:14] neighbor's house trying to tell him
[1:22:15] about him being saved he said they
[1:22:17] didn't want to talk to me about me being
[1:22:19] saved cuz see his saving was more than
[1:22:21] what their saving they thought of their
[1:22:23] saving was going and joining the church
[1:22:25] or doing this out of the other his
[1:22:27] saving was telling them what God had
[1:22:29] delivered him
[1:22:31] from right but
[1:22:35] listen now look he cannot save you by
[1:22:39] the merits of your prayer that's right
[1:22:43] he cannot save you by the merits of your
[1:22:45] enthusiasm are good works amen he saves
[1:22:49] you by the merits of your faith and your
[1:22:53] confession all right that's Romans 8
[1:22:55] right believe in your heart confess with
[1:22:58] your mouth not just one part both of
[1:23:02] them okay let's see if I can get a
[1:23:04] little bit more go ahead with numbers
[1:23:10] 6A the one we used one ago Romans 8:34
[1:23:14] who is he that condemneth it is Christ
[1:23:16] that died rather that is risen again who
[1:23:19] is even at the right hand of God who
[1:23:22] also maketh intercession for us he's got
[1:23:26] a job he's doing something he's doing it
[1:23:29] every day he's doing it every
[1:23:32] hour he's making
[1:23:36] confession or you know on what we say
[1:23:39] all right look at the next one Hebrews
[1:23:41] 12:2 looking unto Jesus the author and
[1:23:44] finisher of our faith remember you're
[1:23:47] saved by your
[1:23:49] faith and your
[1:23:51] confession
[1:23:54] looking under Jesus the author and
[1:23:55] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[1:23:58] that was set before him endured the
[1:24:01] cross it wasn't too much of a joy set
[1:24:03] before him when he know he's going to
[1:24:04] have to die but he knew beyond that
[1:24:07] despising the shame and is sat down at
[1:24:10] the right hand of the Throne of God what
[1:24:13] far what is he at the right hand far we
[1:24:15] read it morning AG go to make
[1:24:17] intercession amen he's got a job to do
[1:24:21] every day
[1:24:26] he's real
[1:24:28] busy

[1:24:56] And1 now any scholar knows that the same
[1:24:59] word profession is

[1:25:15] taking care of all things I
[1:25:17] do why is it this if we don't confess
[1:25:20] our sins what happens
[1:25:25] for am I in the scripture if we don't
[1:25:27] confess our sins what are we going to do
[1:25:30] we're going to answer no white throne
[1:25:32] for the Bride come
[1:25:34] on but the Bible speaks
[1:25:38] of a
[1:25:40] judgment seat not a white Throne
[1:25:43] judgment where he give an account of the
[1:25:45] Deeds Done in the body so don't think

[1:26:24] that's when did he die for our
[1:26:27] sins when did he save
[1:26:29] you it's already
[1:26:32] done what's our confession supposed to
[1:26:34] be you remember the statement when it
[1:26:36] first started our confession has got to
[1:26:38] be correct amen what is your

[1:27:23] I've met the conditions that Jesus
[1:27:26] Christ required for me what is the
[1:27:28] condition
[1:27:30] word and the word says

[1:29:41] be this evening you're going to see
[1:29:43] brother brandham says this at least 20
[1:29:47] times I believe that's about close
[1:29:49] number I've got about 11 or 12 of them I
[1:29:51] know
[1:29:52] where he says God can't do
[1:29:55] nothing until you confess
[1:29:58] it no no he
[1:30:01] go you argue with your Prophet so what
[1:30:05] should he
[1:30:06] say he cannot do one thing for you until
[1:30:10] first you believe it and accept it and
[1:30:14] confess it what to be
[1:30:19] so already done
[1:30:23] and the people
[1:30:24] today they'll go out and say well I felt
[1:30:28] better last night but
[1:30:30] today I'm so bad I just can't hardly
[1:30:33] stand it that's exactly when you lose
[1:30:38] your confession
[1:30:42] amen so that's why you can be healed Y
[1:30:45] and lose it I ain't talking about
[1:30:47] salvation right come on Amen if you're
[1:30:50] at justification sanctification yes sir
[1:30:53] read that's right if you got to baptism
[1:30:55] with the Holy
[1:30:56] Ghost you can't be lost that's right so
[1:30:59] that solves the problem okay that's just
[1:31:02] exactly when you lose your confession
[1:31:04] and drop right down no matter who you
[1:31:07] are how saintly how Godly you are you're
[1:31:11] a minister clergyman or you're a deacon
[1:31:15] or whatever you are are you've been a
[1:31:18] Christian for 50
[1:31:20] years if you go out of here
[1:31:24] tomorrow and lose faith that you're a
[1:31:27] Christian and start telling people
[1:31:30] you're not a Christian
[1:31:33] anymore your back's
[1:31:36] lit now the backslide is not being lost
[1:31:40] right Christians
[1:31:43] backsliding sure amen you say about
[1:31:46] being lost said you're backslider
[1:31:49] right you see why are conf confession
[1:31:52] should be
[1:31:53] always positive and never negative
[1:31:56] that's
[1:31:59] right right right it should be that we
[1:32:03] keep
[1:32:04] confessing not only by his stripes I'm
[1:32:08] Healed but to
[1:32:10] say I'm
[1:32:14] saved and then what if we don't live it
[1:32:17] then our confession is no good that's
[1:32:20] right right
[1:32:22] I believe in
[1:32:24] backsliding I believe Christians can
[1:32:26] backslide but Christians can't be lost
[1:32:29] true born again now confessing
[1:32:33] Christians justification or
[1:32:39] sanctification you can turn around and
[1:32:41] be
[1:32:42] lost right if you're Justified and
[1:32:45] Sanctified but once you're filled with
[1:32:47] the Holy Ghost you can't be lost you
[1:32:51] won't lose it there's no way so solve
[1:32:54] that problem but you can
[1:33:01] backslide you can backslide to the point
[1:33:04] that you can doubt what's going on and
[1:33:06] I'm going to make my statement end it
[1:33:08] right here that's what's wrong with the
[1:33:10] people of this message now
[1:33:13] am I'm talking to Lula Georgia what's
[1:33:16] out there is listening that's your
[1:33:20] business
[1:33:22] to Lula Georgia I see it like that he
[1:33:25] just said
[1:33:28] it that a l lot of people are
[1:33:33] backslid I ain't de christianizing you
[1:33:35] say you're not a Christian I ain't
[1:33:37] saying you're not born
[1:33:39] again I say true Born Again Believers
[1:33:41] can
[1:33:44] backslide not to the point of being lost
[1:33:48] amen you remember the man on the Hebrew
[1:33:50] Book right
[1:33:54] went got him some liquor and down and
[1:33:55] dranking it beer you know what God done
[1:33:58] he took him off the S you know why the
[1:33:59] prophet said he couldn't let God Mar let
[1:34:01] the man mar mar his
[1:34:05] name that's why in the communion when
[1:34:07] you read that it says many are weak and
[1:34:09] many
[1:34:13] sleep they've
[1:34:19] died backslide
[1:34:24] where was your Zeal
[1:34:26] today that you once
[1:34:28] had I'm talking from the pull pit as
[1:34:32] well as
[1:34:34] you where's the Zeal that we once
[1:34:40] had where's the thing that drove
[1:34:44] us or we like the lady brother W talking
[1:34:47] about that lady that time said and I'm
[1:34:51] glad we we were we grow in Grace and
[1:34:53] knowledge said because when we was first
[1:34:55] started said we couldn't even go to a
[1:34:56] picture
[1:34:58] show yeah see she was saying it was all
[1:35:01] right now cuz she grow in Grace and
[1:35:05] knowledge
[1:35:07] okay and you know backsliding is not a
[1:35:09] hard
[1:35:11] thing it's a simple
[1:35:15] thing it's a small
[1:35:20] thing
[1:35:22] we look at it as not making it to church
[1:35:24] well that's that's part of
[1:35:26] it we look at it as this that or the
[1:35:29] other that's part of
[1:35:31] it but what
[1:35:33] about when we don't believe cuz here's
[1:35:36] my point now we must confess our
[1:35:43] position oh yeah we say we're an end of
[1:35:46] the world oh yeah there's there's a lady
[1:35:47] coming up to the White House we got all
[1:35:49] them things russan come after oil but
[1:35:51] what's that got to do with you and
[1:35:56] me
[1:35:58] right and I'll say it now there some of
[1:36:01] you arguing about who's going to be
[1:36:03] president now get that off you don't let
[1:36:06] that be a hindrance to be a smart elic
[1:36:09] that's to the other person that wants to
[1:36:11] vote for Clinton or you going to vote
[1:36:14] for Trump I'm going to vote for
[1:36:20] Jesus and if there anybody else runs I
[1:36:22] might consider voting for
[1:36:25] them okay cuz I think we got a poor
[1:36:28] thing but that's all right you still
[1:36:30] just don't let it be hindering you
[1:36:32] that's
[1:36:33] right you know don't let those things be
[1:36:36] a hindrance to you that you can't still
[1:36:38] be brothers and
[1:36:39] sisters and love one another that's
[1:36:42] right right right go if we don't you
[1:36:45] know what we're doing
[1:36:49] backslid well you shouldn't say that
[1:36:51] then what else have I got to say
[1:36:58] it why can't we bitterly differ as the
[1:37:01] prophet
[1:37:02] said and still be Christians that's
[1:37:06] right now he he's evidently not talking
[1:37:09] about bitterly different over who's
[1:37:10] going to run for president I don't think
[1:37:12] so okay I think he's talking about
[1:37:14] bitterly differ maybe even over the word
[1:37:16] and the things and the point of life and
[1:37:18] the doings of a Christian's in life
[1:37:20] don't you
[1:37:22] amen the other doesn't even mean
[1:37:24] anything we shouldn't have anything like
[1:37:25] that there should never be a bitterness
[1:37:27] in our heart towards
[1:37:29] anybody it don't matter what they
[1:37:32] do cuz come on you can't put bitterness
[1:37:34] to be of God that's right my righteous
[1:37:37] indignation got stirred
[1:37:39] [Music]
[1:37:42] up I like what one brother said there
[1:37:44] was two brothers one time fussing in a
[1:37:46] ministers meeting and they were just
[1:37:48] fussing away I mean it really hard at
[1:37:51] each other and they finally said we're
[1:37:54] we're not mean or anything we're not
[1:37:58] mad said this our rightous ination his
[1:38:02] brother got up and he said well what
[1:38:03] they're doing said when I do it I
[1:38:06] consider it I'm mad you
[1:38:09] know so that's the point Come On Let's
[1:38:13] stand I didn't figure I'd get to with
[1:38:15] the scriptures because see I'm driving
[1:38:18] at something so I would listen
[1:38:22] cuz we're going to have to confess some
[1:38:24] things that maybe even we don't
[1:38:28] see in reality as
[1:38:31] yet that's
[1:38:33] right
[1:38:35] right I don't believe brother around
[1:38:37] beating around the
[1:38:39] bush when he said like I gave there
[1:38:43] Wednesday that he's talking about the
[1:38:45] Rapture and he said it has been spoken
[1:38:47] now let it come to pass see nobody else
[1:38:50] had ever spoke it like he
[1:38:52] did so the confessions of mankind are
[1:38:56] you listening for a minute see when we
[1:38:59] confess there's three
[1:39:03] gods that cannot be a confession that
[1:39:06] God can make intercession
[1:39:08] upon right but if we confess one true
[1:39:12] and living
[1:39:14] God he can say they got it
[1:39:17] right so as I start it off with what
[1:39:20] let's make make sure our confession is
[1:39:23] right I believe the Lord showed me
[1:39:26] this
[1:39:28] okay if it's right praise
[1:39:32] God but now if it's not
[1:39:36] right then you got the wrong
[1:39:40] confession are you with
[1:39:42] me you see why I'm so hard about the way
[1:39:45] that I see things and say
[1:39:47] things was listening last night brother
[1:39:49] randam said it
[1:39:52] he said I have to make sure that I'm
[1:39:54] right he said because I'll have to give
[1:39:57] an account of every
[1:39:58] word that I've said that's and he said
[1:40:02] if in other words paraphrasing it in my
[1:40:04] language if you took something he
[1:40:07] said and he didn't make it clear when
[1:40:10] you pervert
[1:40:11] it you say he didn't say that but he got
[1:40:14] close enough that made you think that's
[1:40:16] still a
[1:40:18] problem you see why he was so straight
[1:40:21] and
[1:40:24] strict because his confession was what
[1:40:26] God Said remember that till this evening
[1:40:30] what is your
[1:40:31] confession it's got to be the same thing
[1:40:35] God
[1:40:36] says God never said there was a
[1:40:39] trinity right God never said hell was
[1:40:43] eternal God never said the bride would
[1:40:46] go to the white Throne
[1:40:49] judgment mankind has made their
[1:40:52] confessions y that's
[1:40:55] right how much more you come into the
[1:40:57] message God never said there was two
[1:40:59] Lords they were two souls or they were
[1:41:01] this that or the other he never said
[1:41:05] it so then he can't make intercession
[1:41:08] upon their
[1:41:11] confession I know we're humans and we
[1:41:13] make mistakes in our speeches and
[1:41:18] yes but remember it just take what
[1:41:21] thought is go ahead brother 129 anybody
