[0:00] him. But if we don't believe him, that
[0:01] don't make him an unbeliever.
[0:04] He believes his word. It's going to
[0:05] somebody's going to believe this thing
[0:07] and take it to the end. You may be
[0:09] seated in the Lord's blessing to the
[0:10] reading of the word.
[0:13] And I just contend that's the reason
[0:14] that we're here is because somebody's
[0:17] going to make it to that body change.
[0:19] Amen. That's right. Somebody is going to
[0:21] make it even to the adoption stage to
[0:24] where there's some things that'll be
[0:26] done that are supernatural that Brother
[0:28] Brown said it won't be a public show,
[0:30] but in our local community, in our local
[0:32] uh assembly, we can see signs and
[0:34] wonders and miracles. Amen. I believe
[0:36] that we all need a we all need a a
[0:39] miracle. We all need different things.
[0:41] Amen. And as I told you Sunday for those
[0:44] of you that weren't here, you know, we
[0:46] we can I'm sure last Sunday I was I
[0:50] going to send out a note to our to those
[0:52] pastors that we have a a WhatsApp group,
[0:54] WhatsApp group. They started firing off
[0:56] quotes about, you know, the pope being
[0:58] out of the United States. And I didn't,
[1:00] but I started to send a note, a message
[1:03] say, "Look, are y'all going to preach on
[1:04] that or Mother's Day? Which one you
[1:06] going to preach on? Which one are you
[1:08] going to speak on?" Okay. But as we said
[1:10] Sunday, these signs are signs, right?
[1:14] It's not the vehicle to get us out of
[1:16] here. I'm telling you, I have seen in
[1:19] the past
[1:21] week chats and and some WhatsApp, not
[1:25] here, but outside of the people that I'm
[1:28] u connected with. And even got phone
[1:31] calls myself from people that haven't
[1:33] been to church in years. Yeah. They're
[1:37] scared, right?
[1:40] They should be, brother. But but did it
[1:43] take a pope coming out of the United
[1:44] States to make them believe Brother
[1:45] Brandham's message was right? I mean,
[1:48] come on. Did it take
[1:50] that? We knew that. We already read that
[1:53] part of the newspaper.
[1:55] I believed and and knew there was going
[1:57] to be a pope come out of the United
[1:58] States. But there had to be a man in the
[2:01] White House to coincide with that pope
[2:03] coming out of the United States. Cuz if
[2:05] you had two different ones, they
[2:06] couldn't they couldn't talk to each
[2:08] other. But now you've got two that are
[2:10] right there together. But that's still
[2:12] not going to rapture us. It's a sign.
[2:17] It's a sign. There's a turning point.
[2:18] There's a caution. There's a there's a
[2:21] stop sign there that says, "Hey, stop
[2:23] and check up."
[2:26] But I've had a couple of phone calls
[2:27] from people that had been in this church
[2:28] in a couple years. They want to talk.
[2:32] Yeah.
[2:34] I listen, if it takes it, that's fine
[2:36] with me. But scaring you into something
[2:39] is never going to work. That's right.
[2:43] Cuz at 911, two days after 911, churches
[2:47] were full. They were having prayer
[2:49] service at the White House. They
[2:50] everybody was praying. Everybody was in
[2:53] church. And that was 20 what? 24 years
[2:56] ago now. Good grief. 24 years
[3:00] ago. Where those people at?
[3:03] Even message people.
[3:06] Oh, they hit the pews, man. Something's
[3:07] fixing to happen. This is, you know,
[3:08] we're heading into World War
[3:10] II 24 years later. Where are they?
[3:15] Right. I say, listen, we've got the
[3:17] vehicle to get us where we're going.
[3:20] Read your signs. If the sign says
[3:22] warning, take the warning. But that
[3:25] warning is not going to get you to where
[3:27] you need to go. That car that you're in,
[3:29] the right road, the right vehicle is
[3:31] going to get you to where you're going.
[3:32] And I believe we have the right car. I
[3:34] believe we have the right road. And I
[3:36] believe we're on the right path. So if
[3:38] the pope come out of the United States,
[3:39] scares you, something else will scare
[3:42] you again.
[3:44] Something else will scare you. Brother
[3:46] Dell always said, you get them in with a
[3:47] hot dog, somebody will get them out with
[3:49] a hamburger. So you get them in with
[3:50] this doctrine or you get them in with
[3:52] this emotion, they'll walk right back
[3:54] out if they don't get an experience.
[3:57] But you got to have an experience with
[3:58] God.
[4:00] And then you'll know why the Pope had to
[4:03] come out of the United States. You know
[4:04] all about Revelations 13. We We see the
[4:07] book of Revelations absolutely unfolding
[4:10] in front of us. That's it. By the day,
[4:13] start market zooming. Guess what? Gold's
[4:15] going up. Guess what? Who owns the gold,
[4:19] right? We know that. Brother Brown said,
[4:21] "We're broke. We have to go
[4:24] bankrupt." See, here I am preaching on
[4:26] it. Have to go bankrupt. They have to go
[4:29] have to go bankrupt so that they'll pay
[4:31] our debt off. And who's the only one
[4:33] that can pay $32 trillion and not bad an
[4:36] eye, right? They ain't another
[4:39] denomination in the world, they can't
[4:40] even get together and have enough money.
[4:42] They can't even get together anyway. But
[4:44] not to have enough money to say, "Here,
[4:46] here's $32
[4:47] trillion. I'll just pay your debt
[4:50] off. I'd like to have just a little bit
[4:52] of
[4:52] that." But you know what? That ain't
[4:55] going to do nothing for us if we ain't
[4:57] born again. Right. That ain't going to
[4:59] do nothing for us if we're not striving
[5:01] to get that headstone back into the
[5:03] church.
[5:04] Not going to happen. That's right.
[5:06] That's why we've been here the whole
[5:07] time. Oh yeah. There is had there had to
[5:09] be signs, folks. But now I want to ask
[5:12] them people that believe the sign people
[5:13] now what sign they believing.
[5:16] But they're saying brother Ram wrong
[5:17] here and here. In 1955 he made this
[5:20] prediction. 55
[5:24] four 54
[5:26] 69 years ago he predicted that this is
[5:30] what would happen and then this is
[5:31] what's going to happen afterwards
[5:34] but yet he's a false prophet. Well
[5:36] anyway Romans 8 verse I'm off of that
[5:38] now we're done. Romans 8:15 for you have
[5:41] not received the spirit of bondage again
[5:43] to fear but you have received the spirit
[5:45] of adoption whereby you cry aba father.
[5:47] So, there's a fear factor and there's a
[5:50] there is when you come up to a road
[5:52] sign and a stop sign or a yield sign or
[5:55] or falling rocks or something, there is
[5:57] a caution there, but it doesn't stop
[5:59] you. Right. Right. It's not going to
[6:02] stop you from continuing on. It's not
[6:04] going to stop uh you know, good soldiers
[6:06] don't stop because their partner dies
[6:08] right in front of them. He wants to get
[6:10] he wants to strive more forward to get
[6:12] that person that killed that person or
[6:14] wounded him or whatever. So, that's what
[6:16] we got to do. We got to strive for that.
[6:20] For you have not received the spirit of
[6:21] bondage again to fear because fear is
[6:24] bondage. But you have received the
[6:26] spirit of adoption. Now you haven't
[6:28] received adoption. You've received the
[6:30] spirit of adoption. Right? Like I said
[6:32] before, you can be born
[6:34] again but not become to adoption. You
[6:37] can stop that. Amen. But you can't be
[6:40] adopted and not be born again. Cuz what
[6:43] are you adopting? You're adopting what's
[6:44] inside of you already. It's not just a
[6:48] uh you know
[6:49] because seniority.
[6:52] No. Right. Right. 20ome year old people
[6:55] could have more intelligence and and
[6:57] have more of the word of God than me at
[6:58] 65.
[7:00] God's not a respector of persons. It's
[7:02] whoever wants to dig in the furthest and
[7:03] the fastest and the best. We got all the
[7:06] equipment we need.
[7:08] Amen. We're not Listen, folks. We're not
[7:10] looking. I I we're I'm on the u uh
[7:14] WhatsApp with brother Barry Coffee. I
[7:15] know some maybe are too of when we send
[7:17] that money overseas or or send the money
[7:19] to make the books and the books go
[7:21] overseas. Well, those people are just,
[7:23] you know, they're like, "Wow, we've
[7:25] never had this book before. Wow, we've
[7:26] never had this seal book before. We've
[7:28] never had this in our language. We've
[7:30] had in our language for 60s something
[7:32] years."
[7:34] And what have we done with it? That's
[7:36] why America's going to get it. That's
[7:38] why brother Ry said America turned them
[7:40] down first. They're going to get it
[7:41] first. Amen. Amen. I mean, could you
[7:45] imagine sitting here today and never
[7:47] read a seal book, never read a church
[7:50] age book, never had it in your language?
[7:54] So, you and I don't have an excuse.
[7:55] We've been in We have it everywhere.
[7:57] It's on your It's on your arm now,
[7:59] right? You can read quotes off of your
[8:01] smarty phone, right? I don't have one.
[8:04] Don't want
[8:05] one. If you have one, it's not a
[8:08] doctrine.
[8:12] It's just funny when somebody you're
[8:14] standing around talking and somebody
[8:15] goes and then they look back there. Why
[8:18] would you do that? Cuz you got something
[8:19] coming in on your on your uh phone and
[8:23] it, you know, scares you. And maybe
[8:25] it'll scare you. Hey, everybody get
[8:28] one. Everybody get one. I want a button
[8:31] right here,
[8:33] Josh. where when y'all start falling
[8:35] asleep, I'll go beep. I'll send you a
[8:38] text. Wake
[8:40] up. But we've received the spirit of
[8:43] adoption whereby we cry, "Father, father
[8:46] or aba father." The spirit itself
[8:48] bearing witness with our spirit. Look
[8:50] that we are the children of God. So
[8:52] we've entered into a um a family and
[8:56] you're and you're born again in your new
[8:58] birth. Now watch. And if children then
[8:59] heirs, heirs of God and join heirs with
[9:01] Christ. There's going to be just just to
[9:05] make it plain, there's going to be
[9:06] billions of Christians that don't come
[9:08] to adoption. A lot of those that down in
[9:11] the dark ages in different places, they
[9:12] didn't have all the word of God. They
[9:14] had just enough to get them born again.
[9:17] They didn't have these virtues working
[9:19] in their life. But you and I do. We've
[9:21] had a prophet to come and put that all
[9:23] together and to paint a beautiful
[9:25] picture to tell us that this means this
[9:27] and this means that and there's the
[9:28] headstone. And it takes the Holy Spirit
[9:30] up there to mold it all together. You
[9:32] get the Holy Ghost downstairs at the
[9:34] bottom, but the Holy Spirit has to come
[9:36] and mold it all together and put it all
[9:38] fill all the cracks in. Right. There
[9:41] hadn't been cracks filled in over the
[9:42] past 2,000 years, but it is now. That's
[9:47] right. That's why even brother Random
[9:48] told us, you know, the astronaut age,
[9:50] the reason we can take it is because we
[9:52] know how to be pressurized.
[9:54] Nobody else has been pressurized. We
[9:56] know how to be pressurized, right?
[9:59] That's right. So, if we're shaking our
[10:02] head, then let's start doing it,
[10:04] exercising our faith. Praise because
[10:07] we're heirs. What What are we hes of? We
[10:10] heirs of everything that's in this word
[10:11] of God. Everything. Amen. If Jesus,
[10:15] that's like joint hes with Christ. If he
[10:17] gets it, we get it. It's an equal thing.
[10:19] Remember before the fall, Eve got
[10:22] everything Adam got. That's right. It
[10:24] wasn't like this. It was co-equal.
[10:27] Right. Amen. And that's what God
[10:30] wants. If so be that we what? Here's
[10:32] that word. If so be that we suffer with
[10:36] him, that we may be also be also what?
[10:41] Glorified together. Amen. For I reckon
[10:44] that the sufferings of this present
[10:46] time, now this is Paul in the book of
[10:48] Romans, are not worthy to be compared
[10:51] with the glory. Now watch, which shall
[10:53] be revealed in us. If you go through a
[10:56] situation, I went through situations
[10:58] going through situations that when you
[11:00] come out at the end of it, you're better
[11:03] or it was the devil that did that or he
[11:05] did he did it and you did it wrong and
[11:07] you got to go back and take it over
[11:08] again. Right? Because everybody, every
[11:10] Christian that goes through something,
[11:12] it does not make you weaker. That's
[11:14] right. It can't make you weaker. It's
[11:18] got to make you stronger. God's not
[11:20] going to have a weak bride. He's not
[11:23] going to have a weak wife. That's right.
[11:25] But these trials are supposed to is
[11:27] that's the thing that's going to put us
[11:28] there. Amen. If not, come on people, be
[11:31] honest with me. Be honest. Just one
[11:33] time. If you didn't have to go to church
[11:35] and you could make it to heaven, would
[11:37] you come?
[11:39] One person raised his
[11:43] hand. And it was kind of like
[11:47] this. You
[11:49] wouldn't. Come
[11:51] on. No, you wouldn't. I mean, listen, if
[11:55] you didn't have to, if if there was this
[11:57] quote that come up, Brother Ram said,
[11:58] "You don't have to go to
[12:00] church, you'd probably stay home because
[12:03] a lot of people stay home anyway, right?
[12:07] But we have these things in place to
[12:09] keep us in line,
[12:11] to keep us on the right road because we
[12:13] are sheep and sheep have to be led. And
[12:17] we have a chief shepherd that'll never
[12:20] fail us. He'll always be there. He'll
[12:22] always when you need a tap on your hind
[12:25] end like a sheep, you know, he taps it
[12:28] with love cuz he knows that you're going
[12:30] to go in that direction and the wolf is
[12:32] over there. That's right. Amen. That's
[12:34] why God knows are the best yeses we'll
[12:36] ever get. I hope we understand that he
[12:39] can see. He can see till the very last
[12:41] day you draw your breath.
[12:43] But he can also see that if he allows
[12:45] you to do something that you're going to
[12:47] do something different and it's going to
[12:49] hurt you. Amen. Hurt you. God's not
[12:52] going to ever let something go through
[12:53] that's going to kill you. He told even
[12:55] told Satan, he said, "Hey, do everything
[12:57] to Job you want to, but you're not
[12:59] taking his life." That's right. Cuz he
[13:02] owns your life. I don't care if you're
[13:04] He owned Adolf Hitler's life. Adolf
[13:07] Hitler just didn't turn his life over to
[13:09] over to Jesus Christ. For I reckon that
[13:12] the suffering of this present time are
[13:14] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[13:16] which shall be revealed in Paul kept
[13:19] telling not in the
[13:21] word. It's revealed in us, right?
[13:24] Because we have to become the word.
[13:25] That's right. Right. Paul understood
[13:28] that. Paul even said, "The things I do,
[13:30] I would not. The things I would not, I
[13:32] do." Uh there's a war in in my members.
[13:34] And he was a prophet. That's right. He
[13:37] wrote 80% of the New Testament. God was
[13:40] with him all the time. Yeah. But yet he
[13:43] was buffeted. He wrote most of his
[13:45] letters in prison in a damp dark. He
[13:47] didn't have air conditioning and LED
[13:50] lights.
[13:53] He had a candle, maybe a bucket to use a
[13:56] bathroom in. And I don't know when he
[13:57] took a shower. Now I'm telling you, he
[13:59] was in prison, right? and he wrote the
[14:01] greatest letters in prison that's on in
[14:04] the eternal word of God. He I don't know
[14:05] if he knew that, but when he was writing
[14:07] those letters, I don't know if he knew
[14:09] that that was going to be included in
[14:11] the word of God, but he sure was writing
[14:13] them to those people, the Corinthians,
[14:16] the Thessalonians, he would the Romans,
[14:18] he was writing to the Hebrews. He was
[14:19] telling them what they need to do to
[14:20] line up.
[14:22] That's right.
[14:24] So, the glory is going to be revealed in
[14:26] us, but it has to come out of the word.
[14:27] So, if the word's not revealed to us,
[14:29] how are we going to be revealed?
[14:32] Everybody with me? How are we going to
[14:34] be revealed if we don't see it in the
[14:36] word of God? Cuz that's where we get our
[14:38] revelation from. That's where we get
[14:39] everything we need. Our sustaining
[14:42] portion is the word of God. Yes. And we
[14:45] couldn't get a revelation by oursel.
[14:48] Right. Right. That's right. Man's tried
[14:51] to do that. That's why there's a Baptist
[14:53] church over there and a Pentecostal over
[14:54] there and 15 message churches within two
[14:57] miles of each other in another state.
[15:01] Sorry. That's why man's ideas. Right.
[15:05] Right. And they think they have the word
[15:07] of God. Talk to a Baptist. They'll tell
[15:10] you we've got the word of God. We do it
[15:13] right. We're going to heaven by what we
[15:16] preach. Yeah. I was watching uh I don't
[15:19] know what that guy's name is on YouTube,
[15:20] but he's a pretty bold preacher, but he
[15:24] was telling the difference in Roman
[15:26] Catholic and and Protestant. What's the
[15:27] difference? You know, is is Cathol is a
[15:30] is Catholic a Christian religion? He
[15:33] said, "Yes, cuz they believe in the
[15:35] Trinity like we
[15:37] do." He said, "There are other
[15:39] denominations that deny the Trinity." He
[15:42] said, "But that's who God is."
[15:45] I thought,
[15:47] man, where'd you get that from?
[15:51] Well, he got it from his denomination in
[15:53] some creed. Oh, he did talk about he
[15:55] said the apostle creeds, right? You
[15:57] know, brother Ram told us, here we go
[15:58] again. But brother Ram told us that the
[16:00] only thing that separates those two
[16:02] religions is the sacrament.
[16:06] Their sacrament says that they literally
[16:07] turn the body into Jesus or the bread
[16:10] and then the wine, which is absolutely
[16:12] foolish. There's no way you could do
[16:13] that, right? But they've got everybody
[16:16] believing that. Yeah. And the
[16:18] Protestants don't. Well, when they come
[16:20] together with that, brother Ram said,
[16:22] "That's the only thing that keeps them
[16:23] apart." Well, all they got to do is
[16:24] agree on that a little bit right there.
[16:27] That's right. And they're going to start
[16:28] shutting our doors. What are you going
[16:29] to do? What are you going to do when you
[16:32] outside of Noah's church?
[16:35] Yeah. And they shut the door. Right.
[16:38] That's it. It's what happened to Noah.
[16:40] God shut that
[16:41] door. That's right. Un lest we suffer
[16:44] with him. Brother Ram said this is
[16:46] Smyrnian church age. Very familiar
[16:48] quote. Unless we suffer with him, we
[16:50] cannot reign with him. So here we go. If
[16:52] you don't suffer, you don't reign.
[16:54] Because you don't know how to reign if
[16:56] you don't suffer. Look at King David.
[16:58] King David was anointed king when he was
[17:01] a child almost. Amen.
[17:04] He had to go through all that. And even
[17:05] when he became a king, the king that God
[17:08] wanted in there in the first place, he
[17:11] still had problems. That's it.
[17:14] So, you're going to have problems. You
[17:17] got to suffer. Now, suffer is not like I
[17:19] said Sunday. It's not suffering. They're
[17:21] not going to nail you to a cross. I
[17:23] hope they're not going to put you in
[17:25] chains and pull you down the street.
[17:27] They're not going to pull you between
[17:28] two horses and pull your arms apart like
[17:30] they did um was it Isaiah or some one of
[17:33] them they did that to or one of the
[17:35] apostles. They pulled them apart with a
[17:37] with two horses. You know, you never had
[17:40] a bad day before. Let me put it that
[17:41] way. We got air conditioning. You hear
[17:44] it running? Okay. And when it ain't, we
[17:47] call Aaron, right?
[17:49] Okay. But you have to suffer to rain.
[17:51] The reason for this is that
[17:54] character simply is never made without
[17:58] suffering. Now, we believe brother Ram
[17:59] was a prophet, right? We believe what he
[18:01] said. Okay? Character is a victory, not
[18:05] a gift. So, God doesn't give God doesn't
[18:09] give these gifts without you going
[18:12] through suffering, without you going
[18:14] through battles. He just doesn't spoil
[18:17] you by just giving you everything.
[18:20] Character is a victory, not a gift. A
[18:21] man without character can't reign.
[18:23] Because power apart from character is
[18:25] satanic. But power with character is fit
[18:28] to rule. Fit to rule what? You better
[18:30] you better rule this house first.
[18:33] You get this house under subjection. You
[18:35] get this house first.
[18:37] And since he wants us to share even his
[18:40] throne on the same basis he
[18:43] overcome. Remember that's Revelations 3.
[18:46] That's our commission to this church
[18:48] age. Right. Amen. He wants us to sit on
[18:51] the throne with him as he sat on his
[18:53] father's throne. And how did he sit on
[18:56] his father's throne? By suffering.
[18:59] And since he was to share him in his
[19:01] throne on the same basis that he
[19:03] overcome and is sat down on his father's
[19:05] throne. Then we have to overcome to sit
[19:07] with him. And the little temporary
[19:09] suffering we go through now is not
[19:11] worthy to be compared with the
[19:13] tremendous glory that here we go again.
[19:15] He's quoting Paul. That will be revealed
[19:18] in us. Amen. When he comes. Oh, what
[19:23] treasures are laid up for those who are
[19:24] willing to enter into his kingdom
[19:27] through much
[19:29] tribulation. There's nothing you can go
[19:31] through down
[19:34] here. Come on. That's eternal.
[19:39] We're getting through here so we can get
[19:41] to the eternal. Or see the eternal can
[19:43] come here actually. But listen, if we
[19:46] don't overcome, how's this world going
[19:48] to overcome? And everybody's going to
[19:49] get to live on it.
[19:52] Think about that. Cuz Adam fell, then
[19:55] the animals fell, started eating each
[19:57] other, and then the world fell. Storms,
[20:00] earthquakes, min earthquakes in many
[20:04] places, right? East
[20:07] Tennessee, and we felt it here.
[20:11] You know, one of the biggest fault lines
[20:13] they're worried about now is the New
[20:14] Madrid fault line, which runs right down
[20:16] through the Mississippi River. And
[20:17] didn't brother Brown say tidal waves.
[20:20] So, here we looking at prophecy that
[20:21] it's everything's honing in now. We
[20:24] don't have to worry or guess what's
[20:26] fixing to happen, right? Amen. And it's
[20:29] going to happen because you and I are
[20:31] going to get in a place. And I'm just
[20:32] going to put to you real
[20:34] quick. If we don't come to a place to
[20:37] where we can say to this mountain be
[20:39] moved or we can say that storm pass away
[20:41] or we can say I need something to eat
[20:43] God then you're going to really really
[20:44] really really suffer.
[20:50] So suffering through listening to me and
[20:52] brother Bob and brother brother brother
[20:53] Louise and brother Aaron is temporary.
[20:57] Amen.
[21:00] Why do we have to
[21:01] suffer? 1 Peter 2:18 says, "Servants, be
[21:05] subject to your masters with all fear.
[21:07] Not only to the good and gentle, but
[21:08] alto also to the
[21:11] fraward." Listen, it's easy to be nice
[21:13] to somebody. It's easy to you than nice
[21:14] to you. Easy.
[21:16] But somebody that just grates your
[21:18] cheese, the old saying goes. Just I
[21:22] mean, just, you know, the fingernails on
[21:23] the on the chalkboard. Those of young
[21:25] people don't know what a chalkboard is,
[21:27] Google it.
[21:29] AI and it'll show you what it looks like
[21:31] but it'll never get
[21:34] that for this is look watch this is
[21:37] thankw worthy if a man for conscience
[21:41] toward God endure grief suffering
[21:44] wrongfully
[21:47] this is not this is not even you being
[21:49] or me being me and me know I did it
[21:51] wrong it's somebody persecuting me
[21:54] because I'm just like I said before we
[21:56] could people can quote Billy Graham or
[21:58] Roberts
[22:00] Spruel, they can do uh, you know, come
[22:03] up with all these ones that they can
[22:04] they can quote them. But when somebody
[22:07] stands up and quotes William
[22:09] Brandham, they go haywire. Amen. Why?
[22:12] Because it's contrary to everything else
[22:15] that they see and it's contrary to
[22:17] what's inside of them.
[22:20] Cuz if you got the new birth and you
[22:22] hear that voice, not just Brother Ram's
[22:25] voice, it's the voice in the voice,
[22:27] right? the voice behind the voice. The
[22:30] power behind the voice. If you can hear
[22:33] that, then yes, that's your
[22:34] predetermined part that you've come to
[22:36] that. And you say that ain't nothing but
[22:37] the truth. That's it. But a lot of
[22:39] people, they don't mind if you quote
[22:40] different people. But just don't don't
[22:42] quote William Brandham. Why different?
[22:45] He's different. He He's not a He's not a
[22:48] trinitarian. He his baptism is to them
[22:50] contrary.
[22:52] Right? So guess what? If you're part of
[22:55] that, you're going to be contrary, too.
[22:58] Right. Right. You go have a conversation
[23:01] with somebody, even a Christian. You can
[23:04] quote what Billy Graham said. You can
[23:05] quote what oral Roberts
[23:07] said. All the different ones. You can
[23:10] read the quotes that who Spurgeon and
[23:12] all the different ones that they've got
[23:13] the writings of. You can quote them and
[23:14] they're like, "Praise God. Hallelujah."
[23:16] But now William Brandham said, "Oh, hold
[23:18] on." Right now, he's false. We we don't
[23:21] know about you know, you know why?
[23:23] because it's contrary. That voice is so
[23:25] contrary to them. But to us, it's the
[23:28] sweetest thing you ever heard in your
[23:29] life. If it's not, you need to hear it
[23:32] again. Amen.
[23:34] Right. For what glory is it if when you
[23:37] be buffeted, that's buffeted. That's
[23:40] just not one time hitting. That's
[23:42] hitting every day. Hitting that sore
[23:44] spot every day. If you be buffeted for
[23:46] your faults, you shall take it
[23:48] patiently. But if when you do well and
[23:51] suffer for it, you take it patiently,
[23:54] this is acceptable with God.
[23:59] Praise, not with man. It's acceptable
[24:01] with God. God accepts
[24:03] that and counts it worthy.
[24:07] For even here unto were you called,
[24:09] because Christ also suffered for us,
[24:12] leaving us an example, that you should
[24:14] follow his steps, who did no sin,
[24:17] neither was G found in his mouth, who
[24:19] when he was reviled, he reviled not
[24:21] again. When he suffered, he threatened
[24:23] not, but committed himself to him that
[24:25] judges righteously. Who his own self
[24:29] bear our sins in his own body on the
[24:31] tree, that we being dead to sin should
[24:33] live unto righteousness, by whose
[24:35] stripes you are healed. For you were as
[24:37] sheep going astray, but are
[24:41] now are now
[24:43] restored or returned unto the shepherd
[24:46] and bishop of your soul. Yes. Amen. So,
[24:50] why do we need all this? Why do we need
[24:52] teaching? As we were talking about maybe
[24:54] a week or so ago, why do we need
[24:55] teaching? I know we love evangelism.
[24:58] Evangelism stirs you up and all these
[25:01] different things, you know, but you need
[25:02] teaching. We need to be taught. Why do
[25:05] we need to be taught? Because just like
[25:06] in school if you never went to school a
[25:09] day in your
[25:11] life, how you going to learn how to
[25:13] read, right? And you're just going to be
[25:16] I'm sorry. You're going to be a dummy,
[25:18] right? But you went to school. At least
[25:21] you at least you learned a little bit.
[25:23] You learn how to function as a human.
[25:25] Well, if you'll do the things of God,
[25:26] you'll learn to function like a
[25:28] Christian. And it's not going to be
[25:30] dumped on you. Correct. God knows he's
[25:33] the look he's the chief shepherd of your
[25:36] soul.
[25:38] Amen. And the head bishop of your
[25:41] soul. He loves your soul. Amen. He loves
[25:45] you. Right. And what he does, he does
[25:48] with nail scarred hands. Sometimes we
[25:51] think, "Oh, this thing is just too much
[25:52] for
[25:54] me."
[25:56] Jesus, he died on a cross for you not to
[25:58] say
[25:59] that. for you to not be able to have to
[26:02] say that. You can say, "Lord, be it unto
[26:04] me as it was to you. If you can handle
[26:05] it, so can I." He was a human being. His
[26:08] human flesh hurt.
[26:10] Hanging on that cross, I believe if all
[26:12] the sin of the world was put on him,
[26:14] there wasn't a part of him that didn't
[26:16] hurt.
[26:18] And you know, we get our our fingers
[26:19] start hurting and we Yeah.
[26:23] So we have to come to this place of
[26:27] adoption or the third pole ministry or
[26:31] coming to full age because God is listen
[26:34] it's not that he wants to place you. He
[26:36] will place you. He has a group of people
[26:39] that he's already placed before the
[26:41] foundation of the world.
[26:44] Come on. This is not just this is not
[26:46] just something that developed yesterday.
[26:49] Amen. Brother Brown said, "The plan of
[26:50] redemption is the oldest plan ever,
[26:53] right? God planned it before the
[26:55] foundation of the world. He knew
[26:57] everything you were going to do, if you
[26:58] wanted it or didn't want it, how much
[27:00] you wanted it and how much you didn't
[27:01] want. How much you played around and how
[27:03] much you didn't. He knew every bit of
[27:05] that, but you don't." I'm going to read
[27:07] you a quote here in just that was the
[27:08] quote I was looking for. Where Brother
[27:10] Brandham says we He says, "Remember, you
[27:12] become the word as you receive the
[27:14] word." Right. Right. He said, "But you
[27:16] didn't come word for him." Right.
[27:19] If you'd have come word form, you'd have
[27:20] come perfect because the word's perfect.
[27:23] But we're heading to that. Jesus came
[27:26] word form. He came exactly by the word
[27:28] of God. Exactly by the word of God. And
[27:32] they killed him for it. What are they
[27:34] going to do to us?
[27:35] But we had to have something to restore
[27:38] everything back to the original so that
[27:41] God can flow through and and you know
[27:44] read that or listen to the tape you know
[27:46] the u um the what is the thinking man's
[27:50] filter and then the greatest battle ever
[27:52] fought where he talks about the flu
[27:53] being stopped up but what is it stopped
[27:55] up with it's not not it's not stopped up
[27:57] with the word of God right it's stopped
[28:00] up with our thinking our stinking
[28:01] thinking our ideas our sin our things
[28:03] that we think about that ought to be
[28:05] done. That's not done the way we want it
[28:07] done.
[28:09] Everybody with me? Amen. The word of God
[28:12] tells us what to do. Are we doing what
[28:15] it says?
[28:17] Come on. Are we doing what the word of
[28:20] God says? Cuz that's the only way you
[28:22] can get your flu unstopped. Amen. The
[28:25] only way. It's washed by the water of
[28:28] the clean word of God. As a preacher
[28:31] said not too long ago, he said, "You
[28:32] can't get you can't get perfected by a
[28:35] dirty word." And I'm sorry, but they
[28:37] preach a dirty word out there because
[28:39] it's been handled, Brother Bam said,
[28:40] remember, right? It's been handled by
[28:43] man. It's not virgin to God. It's been
[28:45] handled by man. Man has took the creeds.
[28:48] And I love those people. Some of them
[28:50] are going to go to heaven. Yeah. But I
[28:53] don't see how you can turn this word
[28:54] down and go to heaven. Right. Amen. And
[28:58] I mean it put right in front of your
[28:59] face and you turn it down. I don't know.
[29:02] Yeah. I'm glad I'm not the judge.
[29:06] I leave that to him. That's right. But I
[29:09] know one thing's for sure. If we don't
[29:11] become that word of God, we're in bad
[29:14] shape oursel. We're going to go to a
[29:16] grave.
[29:19] But we don't have to.
[29:22] Yes. That's right. We don't have to. The
[29:24] only ones at the end time. Notice the
[29:26] very day when this messenger or not when
[29:28] he starts on in other words not the
[29:30] healing campaign but when he begins to
[29:32] declare his message see first pull was
[29:34] healing it's when brother Brown went on
[29:36] the campaign second pull was prophesying
[29:38] when he started telling people the
[29:40] thoughts of their heart the third pull
[29:42] is the opening of the word the mysteries
[29:43] revealed which we know that was the
[29:46] seals and the thunders opening with the
[29:49] seals and all the great mysteries that
[29:51] was revealed after 1963. But what did it
[29:54] do? It revealed where God was. He said,
[29:58] "Oh, no. It revealed who where the devil
[30:00] was." It exposed where the devil was.
[30:03] That's right. It exposed where he was
[30:05] at. Brother Ram knew. He said, "Here
[30:06] stands a lamb." Well, where did that
[30:08] white horse rider ride off from? Him.
[30:13] Oh, boy. Nobody said amen. Harley.
[30:17] That's where that white horse rider rode
[30:18] off. All those ideas he had went riding
[30:21] off. Yes. That's right. He said, "And
[30:23] there goes." Well, where did it come
[30:25] from? It came from him. You got to see
[30:28] the same thing. When the seal's open,
[30:31] you expose where Satan is.
[30:35] And then you can get rid of it because
[30:38] remember in the church down to the
[30:39] church ages, he hid in false religion,
[30:42] false doctrine. That's right. And God
[30:45] accepted it. Wked at their ignorance.
[30:46] Brother Brown said, because he knew
[30:48] there was a time where a group of people
[30:50] like me and you are going to be here
[30:51] today, like me and you are going to take
[30:53] this word of God and carry it on. Right.
[30:55] Amen. Let's don't get weak. We got to
[30:58] get stronger.
[31:01] Notice the very day when this messenger,
[31:03] not when he starts on first pull was
[31:05] healing, he had many, many prayer lines.
[31:08] Second pull, remember even in the prayer
[31:10] lines he'd have during the second pull,
[31:11] he maybe only discerned eight or 10
[31:14] people. there'd be hundreds lined up. It
[31:18] just wore him out. But what he was doing
[31:20] was is he was letting God take over his
[31:22] body and then he was what? Discerning
[31:24] the thoughts and intents of the heart.
[31:26] And then the third pull was the opening
[31:28] of the word, the mysteries revealed. You
[31:30] see, brother Brown, in his later years,
[31:31] I was I think it was 1964. I was
[31:34] listening to today or took a day off and
[31:36] did some work and uh it didn't sound
[31:39] right, did it? I took a day off and did
[31:41] some work. Not that I don't work
[31:43] anyway, but I was listening to brother
[31:45] Random and he was is in 1964 and I
[31:48] trying to remember Christ revealed in
[31:50] his own word or something like that and
[31:52] he was calling people out just as soon
[31:54] as just as soon as he got finished
[31:55] preaching. He didn't have a prayer
[31:57] line and he didn't say I'm waiting on
[32:00] him. Remember all down in the 50s he'd
[32:02] say you know what I'm doing. He would
[32:04] talk for 20 minutes. That's right. Come
[32:07] on. He'd talk for 20 minutes. He said
[32:09] you know what I'm doing. I'm waiting on
[32:11] him. Well, I believe when brother Bam
[32:13] came to adoption, the seals open and God
[32:15] positionally placed him. He didn't have
[32:17] to wait on him.
[32:20] He became one with what he was waiting
[32:22] on. Amen. So, he just started when this
[32:25] when the u u when he got finished with
[32:28] the sermon, he just started discerning.
[32:29] Just pop pop pop. Oh, brother, you're
[32:32] this and you're that, you this, you
[32:33] this. You did this, sister. You did
[32:35] this. He didn't have to wait on
[32:36] something. That's why go. But God was
[32:38] training him during that time. Remember
[32:41] the angel told him said, "You've made a
[32:42] mess of this thing." Oh, come on,
[32:44] somebody.
[32:46] Didn't he tell the angel stood right
[32:48] beside of him and said, "You've done
[32:50] what I told you not to do." That's
[32:51] right. I told you don't explain it and
[32:54] you've been explaining it. That's why he
[32:55] got that all that line all tangled up.
[32:58] Amen. Correct.
[33:00] But he moved on up to the third pull.
[33:04] There's no more higher order to reveal
[33:07] the word than prophets. I like what
[33:09] brother Bradom he preached the great u
[33:12] marriage and
[33:13] divorce. He got finished preaching. If
[33:15] you'll remember the last thing I believe
[33:17] it was he said on the tape. If you'll
[33:19] look at the book you'll see he said and
[33:21] the word comes to the prophet.
[33:26] He was he was identifying there was no
[33:28] other way he could have said what he
[33:30] said had he not been a prophet. Right?
[33:32] Maybe if you'll look or own the book or
[33:34] listen to the right tape. He got ready
[33:35] to walk off and he said he said, "I'll
[33:38] do nothing." In other words, till I
[33:40] reveal it to my servants, the prophet.
[33:42] Amen. He was telling them right there
[33:44] who he was.
[33:46] Amen. But the only way the prophet could
[33:48] be vindicated is by what? By the word.
[33:52] And remember, listen. And remember, the
[33:54] third pull was the opening of those
[33:56] seven seals to reveal the hidden truth
[33:57] that's been sealed in the word of God.
[34:01] And we're recipients of that.
[34:04] United Time and signed
[34:09] Jeffersonville. Yeah, this is one I've
[34:12] added too. What did he say in Malachi 4?
[34:15] Would restore restore back the original
[34:17] Pentecostal faith back to the people.
[34:20] Now watch with the same Pentecostal
[34:23] message. Not 1906. 1906 was
[34:25] trinitarians.
[34:29] AD30 he they weren't trinitarians.
[34:32] Right. Right.
[34:35] The same Pentecostal evidence, the same
[34:38] God, the same power. Now watch the same
[34:41] teaching. Everything exactly with the
[34:43] vindication of the same pillar of fire
[34:46] that struck Paul down on the road down
[34:47] to Damascus. Do you know that was what
[34:49] was taken in 1950 over brother Ram's
[34:51] head? That same pillar of fire that
[34:53] struck Paul down on the road to
[34:54] Damascus. Does God ever change?
[34:57] It was that same pillar of fire that led
[34:58] the children of Israel. Brother Ram told
[35:00] us that. It was the same pillar of fire
[35:02] that met Moses in the burning bush. Not
[35:05] different. Same one, same person. Amen.
[35:08] So what are we under? We're under that
[35:10] anointing now. That's right. Amen.
[35:15] The same teaching. everything exactly
[35:17] with the vindication of the same pillar
[35:19] of fire that struck Paul down on the
[35:21] road to
[35:22] Damascus among us today doing the same
[35:25] thing he did in that day uniting he's
[35:28] preaching on uniting time and sign now
[35:30] watch we see the nations uniting here we
[35:33] come now that was 196 what three yeah
[35:38] 1963 so here we are in 2025 we see the
[35:42] nations uniting we see the world uniting
[35:44] we see the churches uniting
[35:46] We see the bride, you know, the new pope
[35:48] said he wanted to be a pope for
[35:50] everyone. He wanted to bring everybody
[35:52] together, right? His first speech.
[35:57] That's right. We see the bride uniting.
[36:00] Now what? Uniting with the word.
[36:03] Why? The word is God. Now watch. And as
[36:07] the word, as the bridegroom being the
[36:11] word and the bride being the hearer of
[36:14] the word, they come together in a union.
[36:18] They unite like a wedding. Remember, we
[36:20] get married down here. We go to a
[36:23] marriage supper, but we get married
[36:25] here. We have the intimacy here with
[36:27] Jesus Christ. Come on. That's what it
[36:30] is. It's a love affair between you and
[36:32] God. You ought to try it sometime.
[36:33] Right.
[36:35] See, they're getting ready for a
[36:36] wedding. They become one. The word
[36:38] becomes you. You become the word.
[36:43] Jesus said at that day, you know what?
[36:45] All the father is, I am. And all I am,
[36:48] you are. And all you are, I am. And that
[36:53] day, you'll know that I'm in the Father,
[36:55] the Father in me, I in you, and you in
[36:56] me. See, at that day, what day? This day
[36:59] right here. This day we find out the
[37:02] great hidden mysteries of God being
[37:04] revealed. Oh, how I like
[37:06] that. Perfect faith. 1963 is another
[37:10] quote brother gildus. Jesus had perfect
[37:13] faith. He had it and it come because he
[37:16] was the word. And you become the word.
[37:19] You become the word as you receive the
[37:21] word. So there's no way you can receive
[37:24] it with playing games on your telephone
[37:26] on your on your phone. You do that now,
[37:30] right?
[37:33] You got to get it from the word of God.
[37:34] Somewhere in your life of a
[37:36] Christianity, you got to get read the
[37:38] word of God. Amen.
[37:41] You got to listen to a tape. You got to
[37:43] you got to listen. You got to listen to
[37:44] a sermon. Right.
[37:48] That's what we strive for. That's why
[37:50] that that Satan has
[37:53] eluded or caused
[37:55] us the word to erode so much to where we
[37:58] really don't need to have it. We're just
[38:02] in the message. Yeah. Oh, come on. You
[38:06] see it everywhere. Yeah, that's right.
[38:10] And I and and don't get me wrong. I am
[38:12] not by if if this church filled up with
[38:14] all the kids and and the uncles and
[38:17] aunts and husbands and wives. I would be
[38:21] happy from my heart, happy. But are they
[38:25] coming because they're scared? Are they
[38:27] coming because they finally want to
[38:29] realize that the word of God is correct?
[38:33] I don't want them to come here because
[38:34] they're scared.
[38:37] Fear has torment.
[38:39] That's right. But you remember what
[38:42] brother Brown said? He said that that
[38:45] God told Eve said the day you eat there
[38:47] of that day you die. Right? Didn't he
[38:50] say Eve thought she got by with it cuz
[38:52] she didn't die right then?
[38:55] Are we doing the same thing? Are we just
[38:57] getting by with it cuz it California
[39:00] didn't sink yesterday?
[39:03] Come on. I'm shake yourself.
[39:06] Come on.
[39:08] Are we doing that? Because is everything
[39:10] built on signs?
[39:15] A wicked and adulterous
[39:18] generation seeketh after a sign.
[39:23] I don't want people to come in with
[39:24] signs. Like I said before, get in the
[39:27] right vehicle, then look at the signs.
[39:31] The signs will tell you if it's from
[39:32] God. God gives us signs everywhere.
[39:34] Listen, he gives you signs in your life.
[39:37] That's right. Right. I hope so. Amen.
[39:41] Those that are born of God are led by
[39:42] the spirit of God.
[39:46] That's right.
[39:48] Should we become more spiritual?
[39:50] Absolutely. We should become more
[39:52] spiritual. We should live more in the
[39:54] spirit. We should know more than we've
[39:57] known six months ago, eight months ago,
[39:58] two months ago, maybe even two weeks
[40:01] ago. Right
[40:03] now, we see the attribute. Now, here it
[40:05] is. I'm going and I may just stop right
[40:07] here. Brother Manuel said, "You didn't
[40:10] preach half your sermon Sunday." I said,
[40:11] "No, I probably didn't. What was it,
[40:12] three pages?" Because we gave him the
[40:14] notes, four pages. Yeah, there was like
[40:16] 12. So, here's part of it and then we'll
[40:18] do the rest Sunday. But dad used to do
[40:21] that. Brother Joe, we were talking about
[40:22] the other day. Dad would give them 30
[40:24] quotes.
[40:25] Some sermons he'd read
[40:27] one, he might read 10, but I don't think
[40:30] he ever read 30. Richard's shaking his
[40:33] head. So that's when he was cutting and
[40:35] pasting and they had to put them in the
[40:37] computer before he preached. He'd hand
[40:39] them the notes and they'd be in there
[40:40] putting them in, you know, he literally
[40:42] cut and paste. He cut them out and paste
[40:44] them where he needed them to be. That's
[40:46] literally what he had. I mean, he would
[40:47] cut it off and he'd hand it to you and
[40:49] they'd be
[40:50] flopping about eight quotes or six
[40:52] quotes on one page. He'd he'd tape it on
[40:55] the top and he'd be doing this. He'd
[40:56] hand it to you and be going, you know,
[41:00] right? But we've we we've come up a
[41:02] little bit more. They don't have to do
[41:04] that anymore.
[41:07] But we try to get in as much as we can,
[41:08] but we gave a little extra, brother
[41:10] Manuel, just in case we want to go
[41:11] another couple hours. We got it.
[41:14] Everybody said,
[41:16] "No, ma'am." I mean, no,
[41:19] sir. Now, now we see the attribute. Now
[41:22] here, now listen, this is this is my
[41:25] point.
[41:26] about us being the word of God. As we
[41:28] receive the word, we become the word
[41:30] because we did not come here word.
[41:34] We came here contrary
[41:37] to everything in the Bible. Behold, a
[41:40] virgin shall conceive. That put us out
[41:42] already right there. That's right. Now,
[41:45] we see the attribute, sons of his spirit
[41:47] have not yet entered into the word form
[41:50] body. All right. We're now sitting today
[41:54] in a mama and daddy formed body, right?
[41:58] Born in sin, shaping in iniquity. It was
[42:00] allowed to do what we did to bring
[42:02] children. That wasn't the correct way to
[42:04] do it cuz it's been the whole problem
[42:06] since the garden. Sex has been the
[42:07] problem for everything. Come on, people.
[42:09] You we know that right
[42:12] now. Watch. But a
[42:14] theophony. I'll slow down just a minute
[42:17] cuz this is the last quote I'm going to
[42:19] read cuz I got Sunday. But a theophony.
[42:23] Now what is a
[42:25] theophony?
[42:27] Theophonyian. Theo is
[42:29] God, right? Everybody wait. Theo. Theos
[42:34] is God. All right. Or a
[42:37] spirit. Phenian or phen. Theo theophony
[42:42] is a word body or a God body that can
[42:45] move, that can walk through the wall.
[42:48] That's right.
[42:51] That's how God was.
[42:54] Everybody with me. You were not.
[42:57] That's right. I'm telling
[43:00] you. And I told somebody the other day
[43:02] they
[43:03] were Oh, it was one of the brothers at
[43:05] the I get in trouble all the time.
[43:07] That's okay, though.
[43:09] One of the brothers shook my hand and he
[43:11] said, "I've seen you somewhere before."
[43:13] And I said, "Don't go there." I said,
[43:16] 'Don't tell me you saw me before the
[43:17] foundation of the world, cuz you
[43:20] didn't. Oh, come on. They'll do it to
[43:22] you, won't they? Won't they? Oh,
[43:25] brother, I saw you before. Where'd I see
[43:28] you at? Oh, I saw you before the found.
[43:30] No, you didn't.
[43:33] That's right. There might be a there
[43:35] might be a theophony inside there that
[43:37] was pulling each other together, but you
[43:39] never saw my face before my mom and
[43:41] daddy had me.
[43:44] I was in God. Brother Ram said, they
[43:46] said, "Brother Random, what were we?" He
[43:49] said, "You were nothing."
[43:52] Only in the mind of God were you
[43:55] anything.
[43:57] Cuz that's the Mormon doctrine of
[43:58] pre-existence of souls. We were all
[44:00] Mormon doctrine is we were every one of
[44:01] you. your your
[44:03] theophony, your your spirit, your ghost.
[44:07] I don't know if it was holy or not.
[44:09] Maybe you had to come down here to get
[44:10] holy, but you all were up there and
[44:12] conversing and
[44:14] talking and figured out a way to let
[44:16] Jesus come down here. He had the plan to
[44:18] come down here and die. So, we came down
[44:20] here with him. Well, anyway, look it up.
[44:24] Google it. AI. It'll tell you.
[44:28] But we were nothing. He was the king
[44:31] theophony.
[44:32] Everything just like every child you
[44:35] ever had, men, is in was inside of you
[44:39] when you were born. That's right.
[44:42] You just didn't know it.
[44:45] But if you're all knowing, if I was all
[44:47] knowing, omnipotent, I'd know exactly
[44:50] how many children I'd have.
[44:53] When they'd be born, the day they'd be
[44:54] born, and who they were. God does that.
[44:58] Right.
[45:00] That's why when you're born, I just I
[45:02] can't go with people that says that you
[45:04] were eternal when you were a baby.
[45:07] Right. Right. You had Listen, you had
[45:11] representation that you were going to be
[45:13] eternal. Yeah. Amen. That part of God,
[45:17] just like somewhere inside of me was
[45:19] Josh at one time, but I couldn't pull
[45:21] him out and talk to him. I couldn't say,
[45:23] "Well, there he goes up my arm." But God
[45:25] could. Right. That's right. God knew
[45:28] wherever seed would fall. He knew
[45:29] everything that was going on. That's why
[45:32] he could predetermine that we come to
[45:34] this age and predetermine a group of
[45:36] people that's going to take it to the
[45:39] coming of the Lord. Others could not
[45:41] take it. You and I are going to take it.
[45:43] Somebody's going to take it. Cuz we've
[45:45] been pressurized to take it. God saw you
[45:48] want it more than anything in the world.
[45:50] Amen. Amen. I have to depend on that. I
[45:54] can't depend on my two eyes. They're
[45:55] getting worse. Amen. Yeah. Remember,
[45:58] Brother Bram said, "Sight and time,
[46:01] sight and time was man's two worst
[46:03] enemies." And that's what's doing now.
[46:05] It's We've been now in this thing 60
[46:08] years. But But see, now something's come
[46:10] up. We've got a pope. Brother R said
[46:13] we'd have a pope. So now everybody's
[46:16] excited again. Yeah.
[46:19] The word of God should excite you, not
[46:21] the signpost.
[46:23] Amen. Come on.
[46:26] Brother
[46:27] Donnie, a
[46:29] 2025
[46:31] Corvette or a stop sign. Which one do
[46:33] you
[46:35] want? You got that right. But the stop
[46:39] sign is a sign, but the vehicle you got
[46:41] in is the one you wanted. Well, you're
[46:43] in the vehicle that God wants right
[46:44] there. We see the signs. We see the stop
[46:48] lightss. We see the warning and the
[46:50] caution. But you still got the car you
[46:52] wanted to get us out of here. Amen.
[46:54] Amen. You're sitting in the vehicle now
[46:56] that you're getting out of here and
[46:57] you're not going to move over and
[46:58] transmigrate your soul into somewhere
[47:00] else.
[47:03] But a theophony, this body is subject to
[47:05] the word. Now watch an earnest waiting
[47:08] for the earnest change of the body. Now
[47:12] the difference between him and you as a
[47:15] son you see he was at the beginning the
[47:20] word an immorphy body or a theophony
[47:25] body he came in now
[47:29] listen he came in and lived in that in
[47:33] the person of mazdc but now remember
[47:36] mazdc couldn't be your brother he has no
[47:38] redemptive power everybody with
[47:41] See, that's strange. The redeemer was in
[47:43] that body.
[47:45] But that body was not made to be
[47:47] redeemed.
[47:49] Your to for your redemption, right? That
[47:52] body was created, went right back out of
[47:54] existence. Mr. Theophony, I'm going to
[47:56] say King Theophony just went back up to
[47:59] where he was at in another dimension.
[48:01] You know what? God can do that.
[48:04] Don't hurt him. Don't bother him a bit.
[48:06] steps down into body of flesh, meets
[48:10] Abraham and then gone. Now look then
[48:13] later we never heard no more melazedc
[48:16] because he became Jesus Christ.
[48:19] Melazdc was the priest but he ca became
[48:22] Jesus Christ. Now you bypass that.
[48:29] Okay. Word word form right here. Word
[48:32] form. Everybody with me? Look right
[48:33] here. Word form. All right. You didn't
[48:36] come word form. He did. He came word
[48:38] form.
[48:40] You were in the mind of God. You were in
[48:42] the word of God, but you weren't
[48:44] developed yet. You had to bypass and
[48:47] come around that to drop down into human
[48:49] flesh.
[48:51] Cuz remember, he was this before he was
[48:52] flesh.
[48:54] Everybody with me? I'm trying to, you
[48:55] know, first grade. You bypassed. You
[48:58] went around it. Why did you go around
[49:00] it? Because there was a healer,
[49:02] redeemer, savior. All in all, my father,
[49:06] my husband. Amen. All those attributes
[49:09] was in this. That's right. But it wasn't
[49:11] in you when you were born. Amen. Because
[49:14] of what happened in the fall. There was
[49:16] a dirty womb in the fall. Every womb
[49:18] after that come every person that came
[49:20] after that had to come through a dirty
[49:22] womb except one person. Right. The word
[49:24] guy. That's
[49:26] it. That's right. We bypassed it to come
[49:30] down here. I I'll read it.
[49:36] Then later we never heard Melazdc
[49:38] because what he immorphied into he was
[49:40] Jesus Christ. Okay? Because in that form
[49:44] he knowed all things. We bypass that.
[49:47] But in that form he knowed everything.
[49:50] That's why Jesus said before Abraham was
[49:55] you can't say that. He could say it cuz
[49:58] he was the word from here and was
[50:00] heading down. His theophony was heading
[50:03] down. Jehovah.
[50:05] Amen. All the redemptive names of
[50:07] Jehovah, they called him Jehovah in the
[50:09] Old Testament. He was hidden behind a
[50:11] cloud. He was hidden behind fire. He was
[50:14] hidden behind badger skin. But that
[50:16] couldn't save you. That's right. He had
[50:19] to be a kinsman.
[50:20] Somebody that took on flesh just like me
[50:22] and you. So Melazdc couldn't cuz he was
[50:25] a human. He was a human at one moment.
[50:27] Amen. because he ate and he drank but he
[50:31] was never a baby. He never came through
[50:33] a womb. So he disqualified himself from
[50:37] being a savior in Melzdc. Yes. But the
[50:40] savior was in Mazdc.
[50:43] But there was a a position that God
[50:45] took. Cuz see now I can look back and
[50:48] see that that man became Jesus Christ.
[50:50] Right. Amen. Listen, there's a lot of
[50:52] people in the world think Melazdc was
[50:54] just a priesthood. That it wasn't Jesus.
[50:56] I mean, well, it wasn't God. They said
[50:58] it wasn't God, but it was. Amen. Yeah.
[51:02] And then, Brother Brandham by
[51:04] illustrating I don't know if he saw a
[51:06] vision, but he illustrated when when now
[51:08] here's Jesus when he died. He comes down
[51:10] here and he takes on human flesh, right?
[51:13] Yeah. All right. Let's say this is his
[51:15] human flesh. He walked 30 years. Kids,
[51:17] this pretty good, is it? He walked 30
[51:20] years. But then what happened? This part
[51:23] of him died, right? hung on the cross.
[51:27] They killed him. He had no breath in
[51:28] him. He had no life in him. This flesh
[51:30] went out of went into a grave. This
[51:32] didn't change.
[51:35] This just went over in another
[51:36] dimension.
[51:38] Everybody with me? It just moved over in
[51:40] another dimension so he could be the
[51:43] judge.
[51:46] Remember, he went to hell to preach to
[51:48] the souls that was in prison. Brother
[51:50] Brown said he kicked the door open and
[51:52] said, "I'm the one Noah was talking
[51:53] about." Right? Cuz remember then he
[51:56] wasn't finished. He moved over and came
[51:58] into paradise, opened the door, and
[52:01] brother Brandham illustrates so
[52:02] wonderful. He said, "What did Abraham
[52:05] say?" Sarah, that's the same guy that
[52:08] fed us a calf. Well, he must have looked
[52:10] like Melzdc
[52:13] cuz it was Melzdc. The form he took
[52:15] looked just like Jesus. Nobody just knew
[52:18] him. Nobody knew him at that.
[52:20] Everybody with me? Remember that
[52:22] theophony can't change. Amen. Amen. It's
[52:25] eternal. It can't change. If you ever
[52:27] look 20 years old, he's going to
[52:28] continue. But now he can take on a form
[52:31] that could get 50 years old or look like
[52:33] it was 50 years old. Yeah. Everybody
[52:35] with me? So when he got there, Brother
[52:37] Ram said, "Oh, he opened the door and
[52:39] said, "Come, you know, open up the
[52:41] everlasting gates." And Sarah said,
[52:43] Abraham said, "Oh, look, Sarah, that's
[52:44] the one that fed us a calf." Well, he
[52:46] must have looked like the guy they fed
[52:47] the calf to. The calf to. Amen. Their
[52:50] revelation. Ezekiel said, "Oh, that's
[52:52] the wheel in the middle of the wheel."
[52:53] He couldn't He couldn't get it out, but
[52:55] that's who he's talking about.
[52:58] Amen. One from the loins up was on fire.
[53:00] One from the loins down, the son of man.
[53:03] That was that guy right
[53:05] there. What a mighty God we serve.
[53:09] Because in that form, he knowed all
[53:11] things. And you have never been able to
[53:14] know that. Hold on a minute. Yet.
[53:18] Correct. Thank God for a prophet. I like
[53:20] those words that prophets add cuz he
[53:23] could have said you're never going to be
[53:24] able to be there. Yeah. And that would
[53:26] have been but he said you haven't been
[53:30] able to know that yet.
[53:33] Tonight you should know that yet.
[53:37] Look, you come like Adam, like me. You
[53:39] become from the attribute
[53:43] to the flesh.
[53:46] Why? To be tempted. to go through trials
[53:50] and tribulations, sorrow and heartache,
[53:53] just what we've been talking
[53:55] about, character, character building,
[53:58] right? But when this life is finished
[54:00] here, if this earthly tabernacle be
[54:02] dissolved, we haven't weren't already
[54:03] waiting. That's where we go. That is the
[54:06] word. Then we can look back and see what
[54:10] we
[54:11] done. Can't you look back right now and
[54:14] see what where you started your journey?
[54:16] Well, that's where you met. You you
[54:17] heard from your theophony,
[54:20] but theophony is well not will be me
[54:22] under. It's inside of you. It's your new
[54:25] birth.
[54:29] If this earth have not be dissolved, we
[54:31] already have one waiting. Musicians,
[54:32] come on. That's where we go. That is the
[54:36] word. Then we can look back and see what
[54:38] we done. Now, we don't understand it.
[54:43] We have never become the word. Right.
[54:46] Now, let me interpolate that. We have
[54:48] never become all the word yet. Yes.
[54:51] Everybody with me? That's what he meant.
[54:54] He didn't say you because when you get
[54:55] born again, you become the word. You
[54:57] just not you're just not fully
[54:59] developed. Yes. That's right. We have
[55:01] never become the word. We've just become
[55:03] the flesh man, not the word. So,
[55:05] whatever mom and daddy produced didn't
[55:07] come from the word of God.
[55:09] It came as a permissive will to keep to
[55:12] to drive you to the word of God. Right?
[55:17] But and look clearly makes it clear. You
[55:20] will never be the word unless you was a
[55:22] thought at the beginning.
[55:25] That's right. In this person, you were a
[55:28] thought. God knew you thought about you
[55:31] before you were before there was even a
[55:32] world you to live on.
[55:37] He didn't just think about you. You were
[55:39] him. That's right. You were part of his
[55:43] progeny. You were his DNA. Everything he
[55:46] is, he can subdivide
[55:48] himself. Not like we
[55:50] do. Cuz Josh is different from me.
[55:53] Right. But in theophony, we're all the
[55:56] same. Yes. That's right.
[55:59] Because there's not a Luis Ureo
[56:01] theophony that's better than a Weedale
[56:02] Theophony. I know that for a fact.
[56:06] Cuz we're kin folks. Amen. We were kin
[56:09] folks with the devil for a while, but
[56:11] we're kin folk now. And we what? We like
[56:13] to come together because family comes
[56:16] together. All right. Real quick now.
[56:20] Watch. But look, it clearly makes it
[56:21] clear. You will never be the word unless
[56:23] you was a thought at the beginning. Not
[56:25] not a not a not a person.
[56:30] Yes, you were in seed form.
[56:32] Just like your kids, they were in seed
[56:35] form, but they had to be put in a
[56:37] bedding ground. Right.
[56:41] Put in a bed ground. Eve didn't come. I
[56:44] mean, Mary didn't come here with Christ
[56:46] in her. Right. Come on. Right.
[56:51] That proves the predestination of God.
[56:53] You can't be the word unless you're a
[56:55] thought. You had to be in the thinking
[56:58] first. God didn't just develop you down
[57:00] through here down here. He developed you
[57:02] from the foundation of the world. That's
[57:04] why you can say yes. I was
[57:06] predestinated. Amen. Amen.
[57:09] But you see, and now watch. In order to
[57:12] stand temptation, here we are. In order
[57:14] to stand suffering, in order to stand
[57:17] this temptation, you had to bypass that
[57:20] theophony, which is what? Perfect. Never
[57:22] had a bad day, never cursed, never
[57:24] smoked a cigarette, never
[57:26] never. You can't blame your
[57:28] theophony now for what you did then.
[57:32] Your theophony is God and it's perfect.
[57:36] That's right. But you had to come down
[57:37] here in flesh to be tempted by sin. He
[57:40] said tempted three times. And then if
[57:43] you
[57:44] stand all the father hath given me will
[57:47] come to me. Not because the pope come
[57:50] out of the United States. Correct.
[57:52] They'll it'll be the pull of the word of
[57:54] God. Amen. Yes. Now listen, we may have
[57:58] to get them in here and get them under
[57:59] the nest. That may be it. We may, and I,
[58:02] like I said, I'm not discluding nobody.
[58:04] I wish this whole place would fill up.
[58:06] We just preach Jesus Christ and and
[58:08] salvation till they get saved and forget
[58:10] about preaching about a pope, right?
[58:15] They can learn that later.
[58:17] And I'll raise him up at the last day.
[58:19] See, you had to be first. Let me finish
[58:24] that in the mind of God. That's right.
[58:27] Amen. And even the adoption part has got
[58:31] to be fulfilled when you come down here
[58:33] in flesh. That's it.
[58:37] Amen.
[58:38] This is all the character of God, right?
[58:41] This is the characteristics of God
[58:42] himself, Jesus Christ. That's right. But
[58:45] remember, we weren't born Jesus Christ.
[58:47] We were born from mom and daddy with an
[58:49] Adamic nature. Let me tell you something
[58:51] real quick. Stand to our feet. Remember
[58:53] the picture that that was taken and I
[58:55] was going to try to find it but daddy's
[58:57] got it somewhere. Remember where brother
[58:59] Brian's preaching and then you've got
[59:00] those squiggly lines
[59:03] Aaron. He's preaching and you see those
[59:05] lines coming down and there's a pot
[59:07] there's a vase there that wasn't there
[59:08] when the picture was took. You with me?
[59:10] California. California.
[59:13] If you look right back up above brother
[59:15] Ram's head, there's a
[59:16] snake. I'd never seen that before. A
[59:19] brother told me that brother Brown told
[59:22] his daddy that he said that was the
[59:24] devil and the devil was always my old
[59:26] nature was always with me. If you'll
[59:29] look right above his head, right back in
[59:31] the back, you'll see all this which was
[59:33] the the shine of glory coming down with
[59:36] the with the pot of of flowers. Look
[59:38] right above his head, there's a squiggly
[59:40] let's just it's a snake. He's brother
[59:42] Brown said see there he's always with
[59:44] me. I have to fight him all the time.
[59:46] Even a great prophet and the shikina
[59:48] glory coming down. The devil was right
[59:51] there. Don't think you can ever defeat
[59:53] him by yourself. You can't defeat him by
[59:56] yourself. Amen. Even with the Holy
[59:58] Ghost, it's hard.
[1:00:04] It's hard, but you can overcome by the
[1:00:07] word of God and your testimony. That's
[1:00:09] what the Bible says. Amen. Amen. Let's
[1:00:12] sing a song. God bless you.
[1:00:15] We'll finish
[1:00:16] [Music]
[1:00:22] Sundayclaim Jesus the light of the
[1:00:29] world. Love and mercy

[1:00:56] Christ. Shine all around us. The darkest
[1:01:01] day you've ever had in your life, if

[1:01:05] altitude, the sun's shining all the
[1:01:07] time. Get above those clouds.
[1:01:12] The
[1:01:14] Savior's earnest call.
[1:01:18] I believe he's calling. I do believe
[1:01:20] he's calling. The final voice is ringing
[1:01:23] out.
[1:01:25] Some are going to take it. Some are not.
[1:01:29] But we don't pick them. He does. We let
[1:01:31] him do it.
[1:01:33] The light of the world. Sing it to him.
[1:01:37] We will walk in the
[1:01:40] light, a

[1:01:50] are
[1:01:51] bright. Shine all around us by day and
[1:01:56] by
[1:01:57] night. Jesus the light of the world.
[1:02:05] Oh, why not seek him then today? It is
[1:02:11] getting short, folks. The time is
[1:02:13] getting short.
[1:02:16] Things could rapidly change in a moment.
[1:02:20] It's truth the
[1:02:22] narrow
[1:02:24] way. Jesus the light of the world.
[1:02:31] will walk in the light. Thank God that
[1:02:35] we've been shown a light.
[1:02:39] You ever thank him? Thank him. Thank you
[1:02:41] for what he's g you. Thank him for this
[1:02:45] message that he allowed you to
[1:02:46] [Music]

[1:02:57] Oh, come confess him as your
[1:03:04] king. Jesus, the light of the world.
[1:03:09] What's going to
[1:03:10] happen when the bells of heaven will
[1:03:17] ring Jesus the light of the world. Sing
[1:03:22] it to him. Oh, we walk in the light.
[1:03:28] Beautiful
[1:03:30] life, come when the dew drops of mercy
[1:03:35] are
[1:03:36] bright, shine all around us by day and
[1:03:41] sing it to him one more
[1:03:43] time. Jesus the light of the world.
[1:03:48] Let's sing it. Oh, we walk in the
[1:03:53] light. Beautiful life.
[1:03:57] Come where the new drops of mercy are
[1:04:02] bright. Shine all around us by day and
