[15:29] when All the Troubles of life as sail us
[15:31] and this Satan just throws his darts at
[15:33] us and things seem to go maybe not the
[15:37] way that we intended or hoped that they
[15:38] would go things take a turn for the
[15:40] South Lord we know that all things work
[15:43] to the good of them that are love the
[15:44] Lord and are called according to your
[15:46] purpose Lord many many times it things
[15:49] like seems like things squeeze us a
[15:50] little bit but we have confidence
[15:52] because your word says you'll never
[15:53] leave us you'll never forsake us you're
[15:56] always with us I thank you Lord Lord God
[15:59] for these promises that you given unto
[16:00] us that are laying here in your word and

[16:06] help us Lord that you'll Quicken it to
[16:08] us and you'll just feel at Liberty Lord
[16:09] to move Among Us Lord and to open up
[16:11] these things to us to make it live to us
[16:13] so that it's more than just something
[16:15] laying here on the page but it's
[16:16] something that will really spring forth
[16:19] and give us encouragement in the hour
[16:21] that we need it we ask these things in
[16:23] your name
[16:26] amen now I want to take a a little title
[16:29] from this scripture to come and see and
[16:31] um maybe it'll take me a while to get to
[16:33] that uh to get to that title in my in my
[16:36] message tonight but um Lord will and
[16:39] you'll see why I I titled it that so
[16:43] we'll start at verse one here in 2
[16:44] Thessalonians now we beseech you
[16:47] brethren in 2 Thessalonians chapter 2
[16:50] now we beseech you Brethren by the
[16:51] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by
[16:54] our gathering together unto him that ye
[16:56] be not soon shaken in mind or be
[16:58] troubled neither by Spirit nor by word
[17:00] nor by letter as from us as that as that
[17:03] the day of Christ is at hand let no man
[17:05] deceive you by any means oh he's already
[17:08] talking about don't don't let anything
[17:10] deceive you let no man deceive you by
[17:13] any means for that day shall not come
[17:15] except there come a falling away first
[17:18] and that man of sin be revealed the son
[17:20] of predition who opposeth and exalteth
[17:24] himself above all that is called God or
[17:26] that is worshiped so that he he as God
[17:29] sth in the temple of God showing himself
[17:33] that he is God see that's where the
[17:34] Antichrist wants to find himself maybe
[17:36] not so much in the barroom with a honky
[17:38] tonk but right here in the religious
[17:41] right here messing with
[17:43] you let's say it like that right here
[17:46] poking and prodding at
[17:48] you remember you not that when I was yet
[17:52] I was yet with you I told you these
[17:54] things and now you know what withholdeth
[17:57] that he might be revealed in his time
[18:00] for the mystery of iniquity do already
[18:04] work now think about that he's saying
[18:06] it's already working you don't see it
[18:08] maybe uh very apparent right there in
[18:11] front of you but it's working only he
[18:14] who now lth will let until he be taken
[18:18] out of the way and then shall that
[18:21] Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall
[18:24] consume with the spirit of his mouth oh
[18:26] that's a promise that we're all looking
[18:28] for and shall destroy with the
[18:31] brightness of his coming the Lord bless
[18:33] you you may be
[18:41] seated I thought I thought I was going
[18:43] to be cold tonight but I'm going to go
[18:45] ahead and take
[18:46] this the weather's changing on us it's
[18:49] getting
[18:51] chilly but it's warm up
[18:55] here now think about that for the
[18:57] mystery of iniquity do already work only
[19:00] he who now lth now brother Brandon will
[19:03] explain is he God that lth and this
[19:07] doesn't mean to that allow that would
[19:09] allow but that would prevent there's
[19:11] something holding off the devil from
[19:13] being able to just spring fully into
[19:15] full manifestation but now that's going
[19:18] to happen when the bride leaves the
[19:20] Earth or to think now that that you the
[19:24] that Christ is living in you and you are
[19:26] actually preventing that death devil
[19:28] from fully springing into action and and
[19:31] uh taking taking full control of the
[19:34] think what it's going to be like when
[19:35] the bride leaves there won't be any Holy
[19:38] Ghost left on the earth there won't be
[19:40] any anybody that that is a real
[19:43] Christian there won't be anything left
[19:45] but the devil and why would you want to
[19:48] be left in a situation like that I I
[19:51] think it behooves us to really you know
[19:53] just constantly be checking up and the
[19:55] the hour that you you know your
[19:57] situation and make sure that you really
[19:59] are born again because you certainly
[20:02] wouldn't want to be left in that kind of
[20:04] a situation only he who now lth will let
[20:07] until he be taken out of the way and
[20:09] then shall that Wicked be revealed whom
[20:11] the Lord shall consume with the spirit
[20:13] of his mouth and shall destroy with the
[20:16] brightness of his coming so one day one
[20:19] day we can see that Christ is going to
[20:20] step out of the way and then the wicked
[20:23] one shall be revealed but the mystery of
[20:26] iniquity is already working now you oh
[20:29] you think you think what what the
[20:30] mystery of iniquity that that Antichrist
[20:32] Spirit there's a spirit moving and what
[20:34] his goal is to deceive to get you off of
[20:38] the mark to get you off of the off of
[20:40] the track that God God wants you to rely
[20:44] fully on his word to look to his word
[20:46] for everything you have need of there's
[20:48] where you'll find peace and contentment
[20:50] and joy and and and and and and and all
[20:54] those the ability to forgive one another
[20:56] and love and all those promises that
[20:58] laying there in the scripture and the
[20:59] devil don't want you to have none of
[21:00] that so he's constantly he's constantly
[21:03] at work to try to deceive and try what's
[21:05] what's he trying to do he's trying to
[21:07] get you to doubt the weapon that God has
[21:10] given you that God has given you God has
[21:13] given you his word and the devil's
[21:14] constantly at work to get you to doubt
[21:16] that and now isn't that true all down
[21:19] through your Christian Journey think you
[21:20] maybe you'll maybe you'll get through a
[21:22] rough spot and things don't maybe go
[21:25] quite the way you like just like we were
[21:26] praying and and and the devil will begin
[21:28] to poke and tell you tell you things to
[21:33] make you deny or or doubt the the the
[21:36] way that the word says it now now this
[21:38] is what brother R said in the first seal
[21:40] he said we were talking the other day
[21:41] about people who getting off the track
[21:43] it is just like shooting a Target if
[21:46] that gun is perfectly balanced perfectly
[21:48] trained and sighted it's got to hit the
[21:50] target unless that Barrel moves or
[21:53] twists or vibrations throws it off and
[21:56] wherever or wind puff now now really
[21:59] that's what we're talking about tonight
[22:01] that mystery of iniquity something to
[22:03] get that gun to shake the gun something
[22:05] to shake a wind puff or something
[22:07] something come along and he'll just
[22:09] throw something at it to make you to
[22:10] make you is it really is he really the
[22:13] same is he really with me I don't feel
[22:15] like he's with me oh but you can have
[22:18] confidence in the word of God just stay
[22:20] right with the word of God and brother
[22:23] ra said wherever it starts off at
[22:24] there's only one way to do is come back
[22:26] to where it left the track come back to
[22:29] where you stopped believing come back to
[22:31] where you got off the Target and start
[22:33] again if it's going to hit the target if
[22:36] it doesn't why it just doesn't hit the
[22:38] target and that's the way in studying
[22:41] scripture I believe he said you'll never
[22:45] figure it with your mind that's right it
[22:47] takes the lamb to reveal it amen the
[22:49] lamb alone can do it I I to think about
[22:53] that tonight that when God gives you a
[22:55] revelation it's something that some man
[22:56] didn't do it's something Supernatural
[22:58] that took place in your life that God
[23:00] opened up the book and showed something
[23:02] to you and it's something that so oh you
[23:05] just know that it's supernatural when
[23:07] God reveals it to you and God is going
[23:09] to have a target hdden church we've got
[23:11] a quick why cuz we've got a lamb to
[23:13] reveal these things we've got a lamb who
[23:15] has only the lamb was worthy to open up
[23:17] the book but the lamb has made us bth
[23:20] worthy so that we can look into these
[23:21] things and that gives us confidence to
[23:23] know that we're going to God is going to
[23:25] have a Target hitting Church a church
[23:28] that is balanced a church that is
[23:30] unmovable unmovable by the things that
[23:33] the devil can throw at it and say well I
[23:35] don't think God cares about you I don't
[23:37] think this promises for you no cuz the
[23:39] word says it is says it's mine the word
[23:42] promised it God is going to have a
[23:44] church that is true because she stands
[23:47] for the word so what's our Target now
[23:49] now last time I think we were kind of
[23:51] talking about the target the target is
[23:52] that Capstone that we're trying to get
[23:54] to the Target is the seventh seals but
[23:57] let's kind of go even Beyond just
[23:59] looking at the Seven Seals the target is
[24:02] the seven Thunders under the seventh
[24:04] seal now brother R said now in in the
[24:06] seventh seal he said now you you notice
[24:08] on the opening of this seventh seal it's
[24:10] also in a three-fold mystery this one I
[24:13] have will speak and I've spoke that it
[24:14] is the mystery of the seven Thunders
[24:17] amen now I'm just kind of laying like
[24:19] just a p throwing the pattern out there
[24:20] so we can so we can look and and think
[24:22] about these things he said under the
[24:25] seventh seal under the seventh seal it
[24:27] is The Mystery of the seven Thunders and
[24:30] he said the seven thunders in heaven
[24:32] will unfold this mystery it will be
[24:34] right at the coming of Christ because
[24:36] Christ said no one knew when he would
[24:39] return so now you think about that
[24:41] pattern laying there that like maybe
[24:43] maybe will lay it up against like the
[24:45] pattern of the seven Church ages seven
[24:47] Church ages where all these Loose Ends
[24:49] maybe maybe you could probe and say well
[24:51] this maybe I think this messenger is the
[24:53] right messenger for the first church age
[24:55] but then at the seventh Church age a
[24:56] messenger come along to just tie up all
[24:59] the Loose Ends until there ain't no
[25:00] question anymore now hold that same
[25:03] pattern up that that you can maybe maybe
[25:05] you can probe and and thing maybe you
[25:07] get a little Glimpse at what the first
[25:08] seal is and you could preach about it
[25:10] and all those things but the seventh
[25:11] seal ends it all up it's the end of it
[25:14] so you maybe there's some things that
[25:16] you can see in the first seal maybe
[25:17] there's some things that we can preach
[25:19] about but when the seventh seal is open
[25:21] it ties it all up so there ain't no
[25:23] question anymore and then you can see
[25:24] the thing that was hidden under that
[25:26] that maybe that curtain or under that
[25:28] tapestry that the Masterpiece is hiding
[25:30] under the things the veil is taken off
[25:33] and you can see the whole thing there so
[25:35] maybe you could say we could say it like
[25:36] this that maybe you can pair what you
[25:38] heard somebody say about the seals maybe
[25:40] you can just repeat it maybe you get
[25:42] kind of a good intellectual
[25:44] understanding in your head about what
[25:45] somebody said about it maybe you can
[25:47] understand you heard somebody say that
[25:48] the first seal is justification and you
[25:51] repeat it after them you say well the
[25:52] first Seal's got something to do with
[25:54] justification and I'm repeating it after
[25:56] you maybe you know the Seal's
[25:57] technically maybe you know that it has
[25:59] something to do with one God and you can
[26:01] look and you can read that quote where
[26:02] brother R said my revelation of the
[26:04] first seal is that the that I'm standing
[26:08] here and the white horse rider goes
[26:09] there and you can say you can see where
[26:11] he's saying my revelation of the first
[26:13] seal is that it reveals one God and you
[26:16] can you know the symbols and you can
[26:18] have all of brother brandham statements
[26:20] memorized oh but the Thunder is the
[26:23] voice of God to you the Thunder is God
[26:26] revealing himself and revealing what
[26:28] that thing is and and not just that but
[26:31] making the thing live I'm talking about
[26:34] tonight that this gospel has got to be
[26:36] lived I I think maybe if we could just
[26:38] get away from the notion that we could
[26:40] just know it and if we if we got enough
[26:42] understanding that we could just confuse
[26:44] somebody else and hurt somebody else's
[26:46] feelings and poke and and pride and all
[26:48] those kind of things but somebody's got
[26:50] to make this gospel live and the Thunder
[26:53] shows that it's alive it's Alive walking
[26:56] on two feet
[26:58] in Revelation chap 6 it said now now
[27:01] think about this pattern that we've got
[27:02] here Revelation 6 verse1 I saw John
[27:06] looking he I saw when the lamb opened
[27:08] one of the seals and I heard as it were
[27:11] the noise of Thunder one of the four
[27:13] beasts saying come and see amen and
[27:16] brother said no doubt John might have
[27:18] jumped up in the air when the Thunder
[27:19] roared the Thunder roared and he might
[27:21] have whoa might have might have scared
[27:23] him a little bit and there when the
[27:25] first seal opened a sounded like a
[27:27] Thunder and we know what brother R said
[27:30] I don't think we need to go into all the
[27:32] background of the Thunder is the voice
[27:34] of God speaking and without a revelation
[27:36] you won't understand it's just like
[27:38] thunder rolling but when you understand
[27:40] you can hear the message that's being
[27:42] preached well thank god tonight that you
[27:44] could hear not just hear hear falsehood
[27:47] but but you can rejoice when you hear
[27:50] something good being preached I'm so
[27:52] glad that when something TR the truth is
[27:54] being preached behind the pullit I can
[27:56] recognize it and and shout and give
[27:58] glory to God and something within my
[28:00] heart goes to burning when I hear
[28:02] something good being preached not just
[28:03] to be able to discern the the evil or
[28:06] the the the wrong Doctrine but to be
[28:08] able to discern the good so when you
[28:10] hear the thunder and you can hear what
[28:12] it's saying that's one of the greatest
[28:14] blessings that God can give to you to be
[28:16] able to hear his voice but there's a
[28:19] difference between that Thunder and the
[28:21] Seven thunders in Revelation 10: 2 he
[28:24] said and he had in his hand a little
[28:26] book open and he set his right foot upon
[28:27] the sea and his left foot on the earth
[28:30] and cried with a loud voice as when a
[28:31] lion Roth and when when he had cried
[28:34] seven Thunders other their voices now I
[28:37] just maybe want you to think about
[28:40] that what would be the difference
[28:42] between that Thunder and the Seven
[28:45] Thunders there's a thunder that sounds
[28:48] and then a little bit longer later
[28:51] there's seven Thunders right you think
[28:54] now you can probe and prod and all all
[28:57] these things as they're kind of talked
[28:59] about but one day the full thing will be
[29:03] revealed in Revelation chapter 4 he said
[29:06] oh we how we need and Jeffersonville
[29:08] thousands now think think about the way
[29:11] he we know this quote we've quoted it
[29:12] over and over thousands of lived voices
[29:18] not just somebody telling you about what
[29:19] they believe but living what they
[29:22] believe the Thunder of God thundering
[29:25] out how and sweetness
[29:28] and Holiness Purity undefiled lives
[29:32] walking around in the Earth today
[29:36] without a blemish now now there's a
[29:39] thunder not just somebody that say let
[29:41] me tell you what I know but somebody
[29:44] that's living it out living out a Sweet
[29:48] Holy Holy where they they they'
[29:51] separated themselves from the things of
[29:53] this world that's where I'm going
[29:55] tonight separated themselves from all
[29:57] the Netflix and all the junk and all the
[29:59] Tommy rot of this world because they've
[30:02] United themselves in Oneness with word
[30:05] they they they they've just got away
[30:07] from everything that the devil's thrown
[30:09] at them until they're United with what
[30:11] the word says undefiled lives walking
[30:15] around in the Earth today without a
[30:16] blemish he said yes sir real Christians
[30:19] now that's Thunder against the enemy the
[30:22] devil don't care how loud you can holler
[30:24] the devil don't care how you how much
[30:26] you can jump or how much you can do this
[30:28] or shout but what hurts the devil now
[30:31] think about this What Hurts The Devil
[30:34] how many wants to hurt the devil tonight
[30:36] now he said What Hurts The Devil is to
[30:39] see that Sanctified holy life
[30:44] consecrated to God say anything to him
[30:48] call him anything just as sweet as it
[30:51] can be and move right on now there's a
[30:54] good test we just throw there's a good
[30:56] test for maturity a good maturity test
[30:59] so oh you see so many times somebody
[31:02] will disagree with somebody and you can
[31:04] just see a rile up you going to disagree
[31:06] with me somebody will oh
[31:10] but there's a thunder a thunder when you
[31:13] can say something or somebody can say
[31:16] something to you and you don't you don't
[31:18] R back somebody can call you something I
[31:22] don't even believe you're a real
[31:23] Christian I don't even believe that
[31:25] you're preaching what what ever unroll
[31:28] the list like one of Paul's lists unroll
[31:31] it call him anything just as sweet as it
[31:34] can be and move right on he said oh my
[31:38] that throws him away that's the Thunder
[31:41] that shakes the
[31:43] devil what what kind of Thunder shakes
[31:45] the devil when you take this word and
[31:48] Let It Be quickened by the spirit in
[31:50] your heart and in your life and it
[31:52] becomes not just a lot of things that
[31:54] you memorized and a lot of statements
[31:56] and things but but it becomes alive
[31:58] alive walking around there oh come on
[32:01] now let's let's simplify what the
[32:03] Thunder I think sometimes we preach the
[32:05] seals and so till so much is it's
[32:07] something we can't even we think it's
[32:08] beyond our grasp but these are things
[32:11] that God has given us the ability to
[32:14] understand God
[32:15] has we we were talking in the family the
[32:18] other night about about this return
[32:19] Ministry that says well basically they
[32:22] read what brother brandham says and and
[32:24] they say well I don't understand it so
[32:26] no body can and what we're going to have
[32:28] to do is we're going to have to wait
[32:30] until until brother brandham comes back
[32:32] to give us to give us another dose of
[32:34] what he already preached now you think
[32:36] about that think about
[32:38] what why brother brandham did not spend
[32:41] all those time all that time preaching
[32:44] the first and second and all the seals
[32:46] and all the all the messages and then he
[32:48] said if you don't understand the seals
[32:49] go back to Christ the mystery of God
[32:50] revealed he didn't preach that and then
[32:53] expect us not to understand it but he
[32:55] preached these things so that we can
[32:57] know so that we could have Rapture in
[32:58] faith how is this going to give you
[33:01] Rapture in faith because when you look
[33:03] into the seal and you recognize that
[33:05] you're not a bluff that you are not a
[33:08] bluff you recognize that your iniquity
[33:11] is gone you recognize that the word has
[33:14] changed your life you recognize that the
[33:17] true super anointing has come upon your
[33:20] life then you know that God is going to
[33:22] change your body because that is what
[33:25] will give you rur and faith you got to
[33:27] have the
[33:28] seals the first seal oh you think about
[33:31] this pattern of the first seal if the
[33:33] first seal reveals the mystery of
[33:35] iniquity and how to get rid of that
[33:37] thing and what it is and how to boot it
[33:39] out and what what does it then the
[33:41] seventh seal Thunder will reveal the end
[33:44] of the iniquity so the seven seal
[33:46] Thunder reveals the end of the thing
[33:47] it's gone it's gone from my life it's
[33:49] gone from the thing and the first seal
[33:52] brother said all right a thunder went
[33:54] off John knew it was the voice of God
[33:56] and then the lionlike creature said come
[33:58] see what it was and John went forth now
[34:01] with his pen to write what he was going
[34:03] to see and the first seal again he said
[34:05] remember aoud clapping noise of a
[34:07] thunder is the voice of God that's what
[34:09] the Bible said see a clap of Thunder
[34:11] they thought it was a thunder but it was
[34:15] God he understood it for it was revealed
[34:19] to him see it was a thunder oh that's
[34:23] what the church is looking for is
[34:25] revelation Revel cuz when God reveals it
[34:28] to you that's how you will overcome the
[34:30] enemy when God reveals something to you
[34:34] the devil will come well I don't I don't
[34:37] think that he's still the same yesterday
[34:39] to Tak him forever and if God's revealed
[34:41] it to you you can say I'm sorry I've
[34:43] already I've already been there I've
[34:45] already had an experience with him I
[34:48] he's already revealed himself to me in
[34:50] the dead of the night when I was praying
[34:52] and seeking God and pouring through the
[34:54] pages sorry I I've already been there
[34:57] I've already met him like Moses when he
[34:59] went to the pillar of when he saw that
[35:01] Pillar of Fire at the burning bush and
[35:03] we went down to Egypt with confidence
[35:05] then because he had met God and sorry
[35:08] sorry Pharaoh I've done been somewhere
[35:10] I've got I'm ready to take over because
[35:12] I've got an experience oh you you see
[35:15] you see how that see look at this
[35:18] pattern you could repeat to over and
[35:20] over again all the maybe the things that
[35:22] you learned in church about being born
[35:24] again and try to act and everything but
[35:26] when when that's really alive in you
[35:28] it's different now you can confess you
[35:31] can
[35:33] say you can say with the word says
[35:36] that's why God now look that that that
[35:39] Antichrist spirit is trying to pull us
[35:41] away from the word but God has called us
[35:44] to separate to separate from everything
[35:47] that's contrary to the word to separate
[35:49] from unbelief to separate from iniquity
[35:51] to separate from the world to separate
[35:54] from Satan and God's covenant with
[35:56] Abraham and his seed brother R said the
[35:57] first thing when God calls a man he
[36:00] calls for total separation from the
[36:02] world separate yourself Abraham as soon
[36:05] as he got his called now now as I'm as
[36:07] I'm reading these quotes think think
[36:08] about that picture of the SE of the
[36:10] first Seal The Lion and the white horse
[36:13] rider and and that devil that that
[36:16] Antichrist Spirit trying to pull you
[36:18] away from the truth and what God sent to
[36:20] come by it think about that picture he
[36:23] said separate yourself Abraham as soon
[36:25] as he got his call now here it is every
[36:28] Christian in here that's born again when
[36:30] God called you called for total
[36:33] separation now what what that means is
[36:36] you got to come to a place where that
[36:38] Antichrist Spirit don't have nothing to
[36:40] do with you amen that you been it's
[36:42] totally been kicked out that that's what
[36:44] the requirement is to get to get out of
[36:46] here to take a body change and the white
[36:49] horse rider what's it trying to do is
[36:50] trying to deceive you into compromising
[36:54] trying to deceive you is poking and
[36:56] prodding and trying to get you to doubt
[36:59] the word trying to get you to where you
[37:01] feel a little a little maybe a tummy
[37:04] ache or something my toothache or or
[37:05] something and you say well I'm not going
[37:07] to go to church today maybe your little
[37:09] cat gets sick and you say well I'm not
[37:11] going to go to church today and then you
[37:13] could just Blossom that unroll the
[37:15] scroll and all the things that the devil
[37:17] wants to want you to compromise on but
[37:20] if you'll stay right with the word and
[37:22] say I'm not going to compromise with
[37:24] nothing I'm going to do what God Said
[37:26] you watch and see if God doesn't bless
[37:28] you one day there's going to be a little
[37:30] small chosen called out people that
[37:33] God's going to bless them with a body
[37:35] change you see God wants separators he
[37:38] wants to separate that Antichrist Spirit
[37:41] from you so that don't have nothing in
[37:43] you so that oh you see God wants you to
[37:46] totally separate from the things of the
[37:48] world you shouldn't have no trash on
[37:51] Facebook nobody should be able to look
[37:53] at your Facebook page and see a lot of
[37:55] bunch of nudity and a bunch of trash and
[37:57] a bunch of nonsense because God wants a
[37:59] bunch of separated people he wants
[38:01] separated and called out people you
[38:03] shouldn't need a bunch of trash to save
[38:05] your marriage you don't need no trashy
[38:08] books to save your marriage and give you
[38:09] a better married life you say brother B
[38:12] I wonder if you're coming after me
[38:13] tonight well why would it matter if I
[38:16] was chasing after you tonight you need
[38:18] to repent you need to get right you
[38:20] shouldn't need no trash in the world you
[38:22] shouldn't need an influence of the
[38:24] Antichrist spirit in your life you don't
[38:26] need the world's entertainment you don't
[38:28] need nothing that the world has you
[38:30] don't need anything that that Antichrist
[38:33] has now Satan is a faker and a deceiver
[38:37] what's he doing
[38:38] impersonating gifts and tongues and
[38:41] religion and
[38:43] churchianity I'm reading quotes here but
[38:46] there's one thing he cannot do he cannot
[38:48] impersonate that living reveal word he
[38:52] can't impersonate the word brother R
[38:55] said now Satan can imperson
[38:57] can interpret anything he wants to and
[38:59] impersonate any kind of a gift I hope
[39:02] you're learning but he can't know this
[39:05] it's not even he's talking about the
[39:07] seventh seal it's not even written in
[39:09] the word he can't know who think now the
[39:12] devil can't know a revelation even if
[39:14] you tell him what it is he'll be like I
[39:16] don't understand the devil don't
[39:19] understand a revelation so now what's
[39:21] under what's revealed under the first
[39:23] seal how are you going to defeat the
[39:25] Devil how do you defeat amen how do you
[39:28] defeat that Antichrist Spirit you're
[39:31] going to defeat him with the word and
[39:33] you're going to defeat him with a
[39:35] revelation a personal revelation that
[39:38] God has given you that's how you going
[39:40] to defeat the Devil every time Satan
[39:42] can't understand Satan can't apprehend
[39:44] Satan can't comprehend Revelation he
[39:46] just don't know so how are you going to
[39:49] defeat the Devil you going to defeat it
[39:51] when the Devil comes with his thoughts
[39:53] and his ideas then what you got to do is
[39:55] you got to be like like a lion and you
[39:58] got to rise up and you say like the like
[40:00] that the word that that lion represented
[40:03] it is written it is written it is
[40:07] written it is written Thou shalt not wor
[40:10] have no other gods before me it is
[40:12] written it is written just like Jesus
[40:13] did when the devil came to him and
[40:15] you'll defeat him that's that's how you
[40:17] drive out the devil from your life as
[40:19] you speak the word like we were talking
[40:22] about a brother the other night that was
[40:24] going through some hard times and and
[40:26] the the way I encourage the brother is
[40:28] don't say nothing God wants an optimist
[40:31] God wants somebody that'll speak
[40:33] positive things don't say don't say
[40:35] nothing don't don't speak anything
[40:37] negative don't say well I don't I'm not
[40:39] worth nothing I'm not worth this or that
[40:41] but speak what the word says and the
[40:43] word is going to be positive to
[40:46] you and Paul was saying that Faker that
[40:50] deceiver is already working
[40:53] right in second Thessalonians what we
[40:55] just read for the mystery of iniquity
[40:58] doth already work only he who now lth
[41:01] will let until he be taken out of the
[41:03] way who he that lth see see a mystery
[41:10] the mystery of iniquity way back in that
[41:13] very Church age here which was what
[41:17] deceivers you see I'm just reading some
[41:19] quotes here deceiving the people off
[41:22] into something and brother would say
[41:24] it's a spirit work working to deceive a
[41:28] spirit working to deceive now you see
[41:32] that devil will maybe he'll get in
[41:34] somebody somebody like maybe maybe
[41:37] sometimes preachers to say something
[41:39] contrary to the word oh you that CU
[41:41] that's what the devil the devil wants to
[41:43] do is just get right in amongst all the
[41:45] religion and all the churchianity maybe
[41:48] he'll get in some maybe you're one of
[41:49] your
[41:50] friends to say something that's contrary
[41:53] to the word I don't I don't think you
[41:54] can have it I don't think you can have
[41:56] that that promise there a problem so
[41:58] much is not so much that bar room with a
[42:00] honky Tong but sometimes the problem is
[42:03] the pullit
[42:04] sir now now you think about resisting
[42:08] resisting the
[42:10] devil brother BR and the personation of
[42:12] Christianity he'd say if you'd see a
[42:15] spider in your
[42:16] suit you'd condemn that restaurant and
[42:18] set over at the Chamber of Commerce and
[42:20] you'd write it up in the paper now I I
[42:23] was just meditating on this today or
[42:25] this morning yesterday just thinking
[42:27] about how people do so many times now
[42:30] think about what brother I'm saying if
[42:32] you'd see a spider in your soup you'd
[42:34] condemn that restaurant and then you'd
[42:36] go write it up in the paper or nowadays
[42:38] we go on Facebook or on Google and write
[42:41] a big review I can't believe there's a
[42:44] spider in my suit but so many times
[42:48] people go to a church and they'll just
[42:51] let brother Brown said let the devil
[42:53] cram anything he wants to down that soul
[42:56] of yours that's worth 10,000 worlds to
[43:00] think about what a ridiculous
[43:03] statement that somebody would go would
[43:06] get all irate about the spider in their
[43:08] soup but yet just put up with false
[43:11] Doctrine false doctrine that won't help
[43:14] you defeat the Devil false doctrine that
[43:17] sometimes will just let allow the devil
[43:19] to run rough shot over your life and now
[43:22] you see what are we talking about
[43:24] tonight I'm talking about that it
[43:25] matters what you believe it matters what
[43:28] you eat it matters which preachers you
[43:31] listen to on the internet it matters
[43:33] what you're consume and I I was
[43:35] listening to One Pastor talk about
[43:36] somebody would come this is actually a
[43:38] denominational Pastor he said people
[43:41] they'll have like a guest Minister come
[43:42] in and then it might take the pastor
[43:45] another three months to weed out of the
[43:48] congregation all the false doctrine that
[43:50] that gas Minister preached there behind
[43:52] the pulpit if they're not careful why
[43:55] cuz oh you if you're not careful
[43:57] somebody could come in and throw out a
[43:59] lot of things that gets in the people's
[44:00] minds and gets to turn in things and why
[44:03] because it matters it matters what you
[44:07] believe it matters it matters what you
[44:09] amen you know when you open up your
[44:11] mouth and you say Amen it matters
[44:13] because that signify amen comes from
[44:16] that Hebrew word am which means Faith So
[44:18] when you say Amen you're saying faith I
[44:21] believe what you're saying thank God for
[44:24] people that want to ruminate and think
[44:25] about something that is said over the
[44:26] pullit
[44:28] amen that's why you know you know really
[44:31] it kind of bothers me when I'm preaching
[44:33] more not so much when people don't say
[44:34] Amen but when just people aren't
[44:36] interested cuz if you're interested but
[44:39] even if you're not saying amen as long
[44:41] as you're thinking about it I I just
[44:43] love to see people that are interested
[44:45] in the preaching of the Gospel like
[44:47] you're doing tonight that rejoices my
[44:50] soul thank God for a genuine gospel
[44:54] thank God for something without
[44:56] hypocrisy now that's what that first
[44:58] seal is talking about something without
[44:59] hypocrisy something that's real and
[45:02] genuine God don't want to meal with
[45:04] spiders for you he's got something real
[45:06] for you that'll give you real spiritual
[45:08] vitamins and strengthen
[45:11] you but it behooves us to be on
[45:14] guard we are influenced by Spirits like
[45:17] that Antichrist that mystery of iniquity
[45:19] that it's there's spirits that try to
[45:21] influence us and try to pull us one way
[45:23] or the other try to influence brother
[45:26] Bram said in demonology religious
[45:28] realm he said Christians are influenced
[45:31] from above the Holy Ghost influences his
[45:34] church in this realm of mortal now every
[45:37] Mortal here is influenced by one of
[45:39] these worlds the Devil by these Spirits
[45:42] influence men the devil has His prophets
[45:44] and God has his and God perfecting his
[45:47] church he said the sinner is influenced
[45:49] by spirit because he has a spirit and
[45:51] the wrong gives influence and the right
[45:53] gives influence and those who are
[45:55] dominating ated with Blackness and
[45:57] separation or dominated from the
[45:58] underworld of devils now you think about
[46:02] way back in the beginning when in the
[46:04] Book of Ezekiel when when it said that L
[46:06] Thou Art the anointed cherub thou was
[46:08] perfect in thy ways from the day that
[46:10] thou was created till iniquity found in
[46:12] thee way way back when that war was
[46:14] first fought in heaven iniquity is found
[46:16] in Satan iniquity and he brought that
[46:19] war down to heaven and that iniquity
[46:21] that M that's that mystery of iniquity
[46:22] that started way back there and that
[46:24] same spirit
[46:26] that same spirit is trying to influence
[46:29] yes the Demonic Twisted Spirit of Satan
[46:32] rebelled against God because iniquity
[46:34] was found in now what is
[46:37] Iniquity I know we're right here at the
[46:39] top of the hour so far so
[46:44] good what is Iniquity iniquity is
[46:47] something that you know you ought not to
[46:49] do and you do it
[46:51] anyhow and Paul said there's such in the
[46:53] Earth today workers of iniquity
[46:56] what is Iniquity why would anybody do
[46:59] something that they know that they
[47:00] shouldn't do now y'all know y'all
[47:03] probably remember last time I got to
[47:04] preaching on this why would anybody do
[47:06] something that they know if if you know
[47:09] if your mama told you not to go in the
[47:11] street when you're a little kid cuz the
[47:12] car is going to come by but you just you
[47:14] get all stubborn and everything and you
[47:16] go running out there anyway why would
[47:18] you do that if if your mama told you not
[47:21] to go eat a mushroom don't go put that
[47:22] Berry off that bush in your mouth and
[47:24] and you know you're not supposed to do
[47:26] it you and yet you go run out of that
[47:28] bush and you go popping berries in your
[47:29] mouth and then you got to go take a
[47:30] visit to the ER but you know you
[47:33] shouldn't do it there's there's
[47:34] something there's something broken up
[47:36] and twisted in the way that we're
[47:39] made now you think you think about that
[47:41] I'm not really talking tonight about
[47:43] disobeying your mama like that I'm
[47:45] talking about disobeying the word of God
[47:47] because when God's word says something
[47:49] for is for our profit you know you so
[47:52] many times we'll we'll try to you know a
[47:54] young man or a young woman looking for a
[47:56] spouse and so many times they won't go
[47:57] back and looking for looking at the word
[47:59] they go look look to their what their
[48:01] friends say look to every any everything
[48:03] else but what's good now why is that why
[48:06] do we why do we stray away from from
[48:09] from from what we what we know maybe
[48:12] even intellectually of what's right and
[48:14] what's good that God's word is
[48:16] true in Genesis chapter 2 when God told
[48:20] Adam and Eve and of the tree of the
[48:22] knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt
[48:23] not eat of it for in the day that thou
[48:25] eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die now
[48:27] why why would eve eat from that tree
[48:30] when God told her not to she got to
[48:32] ruminating on it cuz that that devil the
[48:34] devil begin to tell her well see he's
[48:36] doing he's doing the same thing back
[48:39] then that he's trying to do today pull
[48:42] away from the word now see how you can
[48:45] take all these seals and run it right
[48:47] through the Bible absolutely amen that
[48:49] same that same devil that's trying to
[48:51] pull you away from the word tonight
[48:54] tried to pull did pull e EV way amen
[48:56] back there very at the
[48:58] beginning why would anybody want to eat
[49:01] out of a garbage can why do people sit
[49:04] in churches and listen to stuff listen
[49:06] to a bunch of Tommy Rod why would
[49:09] anybody want to do something hurtful why
[49:10] would anybody want to put something
[49:12] harmful in their bodies God when God's
[49:14] plan is for you to be peaceful and
[49:16] contented and joyful and faithful but
[49:19] Satan's plan is to twist and contort
[49:21] that plan into something perverted so
[49:23] iniquity you go back to Hebrew the
[49:25] Hebrew is Avon which means Twisted to
[49:29] bend twist or distort like an old man
[49:32] with a crooked back it's all twisted up
[49:35] cuz it ain't right it should be straight
[49:38] should be able to walk straight but of
[49:39] on means it's twisted so iniquities are
[49:43] bending twisting or distorting of the
[49:45] law of God's word to different degrees
[49:48] and God's word says one thing and
[49:51] iniquity is our Twisted perverted makeup
[49:55] right by Twisted perverted spirit amen
[49:57] that goes contrary to God now maybe
[50:01] maybe right now you're thinking well
[50:03] this sermon kind of now we're getting
[50:04] technical it's time for my eyes to droop
[50:07] a little bit but now think about this
[50:08] think about now the there's iniquity and
[50:12] are you thinking maybe maybe think of it
[50:14] like this I don't want no iniquity in my
[50:16] life but God has given us a way to get
[50:19] rid of the iniquity and that is revealed
[50:23] under the first seal how you can get rid
[50:25] of iniquity how you can get rid of it
[50:28] now let's let's dwell on a little bit
[50:29] more iniquity is something that you know
[50:32] that you're doing that you all not to do
[50:33] and still won't repent of it now there's
[50:36] the problem you know if you know tonight
[50:39] that you're B not born again you know
[50:42] tonight maybe maybe you're sitting here
[50:44] and you know that maybe before you come
[50:46] to church maybe you are looking at
[50:48] something on the Internet you shouldn't
[50:49] have been doing and you know that that's
[50:52] wrong maybe maybe before you come to
[50:55] church maybe maybe there's somebody that
[50:57] just ain't living right and they they
[50:59] vaping get unroll the list of all the
[51:02] things that we could do and you know
[51:03] that you're not doing right and you
[51:05] won't repent of it now there's iniquity
[51:08] he said brother R said God will not hear
[51:11] your prayer if you know you should do it
[51:14] and won't do it if you know you should
[51:16] go be baptized in the name of the Lord
[51:18] Jesus Christ and you won't do it that's
[51:20] iniquity and what about this here's the
[51:22] real Clincher of the summation of it if
[51:25] you know that you need to be born again
[51:28] and you won't do it that's
[51:31] iniquity now you think think about now
[51:33] that has something to do with the first
[51:36] seal you know that you need to be born
[51:39] again and if you won't do it if you
[51:41] won't let the word grip a hold of your
[51:43] life there is Iniquity iniquity is
[51:46] something that you know it's wrong and
[51:49] still holding to
[51:50] it when you know your Creeds are wrong
[51:53] and you still hold to it that's iniquity
[51:57] you know better but won't do it it's
[51:59] iniquity see in Psalm 66:18 it says if I
[52:03] regard iniquity in my heart the Lord
[52:06] will not hear me amen if I know that I
[52:10] ain't living right the Lord will not
[52:12] hear me until till what I Repent you got
[52:16] to make it right amen now if you haven't
[52:18] made it right yet tonight is your call
[52:22] that God is calling you oh if you can
[52:24] hear that Thunder calling you tonight
[52:25] the voice of God pulling and calling at
[52:27] your heart to say that it's time it's
[52:30] time to repent it's time let that
[52:32] iniquity be in the past instead of the
[52:35] present it's time to repent cuz God
[52:38] won't even hear your prayer if you know
[52:40] you're not living right and won't
[52:42] repent everybody's guilty of iniquity
[52:46] and Isaiah chapter 53 it says all all we
[52:49] like sheep have gone astray we have
[52:51] turned everyone to his own way and the
[52:55] the lord has laid on him the iniquity of
[52:58] us all now there's how we going to get
[53:00] out of it cuz we got a lamb who's worthy
[53:04] amen and a lamb that can open up the
[53:06] book a lamb that paid the price and he's
[53:09] the one that all of our iniquity was
[53:12] laid upon him so that we could be made
[53:14] perfect
[53:17] am Psalm 51 uh verse 5 says behold I was
[53:21] shapen in iniquity and in sin did my
[53:24] mother conceive me amen that you oh
[53:26] think about that now that you were
[53:28] actually shaping you were formed by your
[53:31] mother and father knowing all the trace
[53:33] it all the way back doing something
[53:35] contrary to the word of God cuz you're
[53:37] supposed to come by the spoken something
[53:39] contrary to the word of God cuz you're
[53:41] supposed to come by the spoken word and
[53:43] you come contrary to that so you're
[53:45] actually your makeup is actually shaping
[53:47] and formed in iniquity a product of that
[53:50] and in sin did my mother conceive me and
[53:52] that's why when you you could tell a
[53:54] little child don't go eat don't go get
[53:56] some cookies out of the cookie jar we're
[53:58] fixing to have we're fixing to have
[53:59] supper and he's going to go do it anyway
[54:02] cause he was shaping in iniquity so
[54:05] what's iniquity is that initial State
[54:07] iniquity is the the root the root of the
[54:09] problem it's the initial stage of the
[54:11] root cause amen while sin in iniquity is
[54:16] that Twisted part and sin is what
[54:18] happens after
[54:22] that oh to to lay it out a little bit
[54:24] maybe even planer to know to know that
[54:28] something's wrong and and you're
[54:29] thinking I'm going to do it anyway
[54:31] there's the iniquity and then you go do
[54:33] it and that's sin to know that you
[54:36] shouldn't be doing it and you're
[54:38] meditate over it that's what I I've
[54:40] always wondered how people people get
[54:43] that get so far in the ditch and you
[54:45] think about if you trace it all the way
[54:46] back all the thinking that they had to
[54:49] do to get to that spot and there's the
[54:52] iniquity I know that I shouldn't be
[54:55] doing that maybe uh speak about talk
[54:58] about adultery that's a man and a woman
[55:00] that's married to one another and you
[55:01] know that you shouldn't be looking and
[55:03] going around with somebody else and you
[55:05] start thinking about it and before long
[55:07] cuz that's what happened in the Garden
[55:08] of Eden before long Eve had I mean uh
[55:11] yeah Eve right had a baby in her arms
[55:15] right iniquity is that carnal condition
[55:17] of Fallen man and the Mystery of
[55:18] iniquity is that spirit that got us in
[55:21] that mess y right and Jehovah gy brother
[55:24] ra said every man is deserving of hell
[55:26] for you're born in sin shaped in
[55:28] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[55:30] there's nothing good about us to begin
[55:32] with because we're all products of what
[55:34] happened there in the garden all
[55:36] trickled down from age to age and
[55:38] iniquity is the reason for lies and
[55:41] theft and murders it's why people are
[55:42] greedy why politics starts off good and
[55:45] becomes evil it's the reason for
[55:47] corruption it's the reason for
[55:50] exploitation for betrayal and oppression
[55:53] it's that deep seated twist twisted and
[55:55] corrupt nature so what's the mystery of
[55:58] iniquity the mystery of iniquity
[56:00] describes that something hidden or not
[56:03] immediately apparent it is the
[56:05] underlying sinful nature or tendencies
[56:09] that are already at work that Spirit
[56:11] moving even if they haven't been
[56:14] manifested overtly it's the thing under
[56:17] the covers that's
[56:20] working and brother Ram said or he said
[56:23] that first stage
[56:25] I'm I'm trying to now we we we're
[56:27] already past 45 minutes so I'm trying
[56:29] I'm looking for a place to start closing
[56:31] in 2 Thessalonians chapter 2:7 we just
[56:34] read for the mystery of iniquity do
[56:36] already work only he who got only he who
[56:39] now lth will let until he be taken out
[56:42] of the
[56:46] way that Antichrist Spirit wants to
[56:49] control he'll control the whole world
[56:52] that Antichrist spirit will own
[56:54] everything and try to control
[56:56] everybody you think about that that
[56:58] Antichrist Spirit moving until finally
[57:02] in verse 8 of 2 Thessalonians and then
[57:04] shall that Wicked be revealed whom the
[57:07] Lord shall consume with the spirit of
[57:09] his mouth and shall destroy with the
[57:12] brightness of his coming even him whose
[57:14] coming is after the working of Satan
[57:16] with all power and signs and lying
[57:19] wonders and with all deceivableness of
[57:21] unrighteousness in them that perish not
[57:23] this bride brother said not this bride
[57:25] because they receive not the love of the
[57:27] truth Christ is the truth the word that
[57:31] they might be saved and for this cause
[57:34] God shall send them strong delusion that
[57:36] they should believe a lie and brother
[57:38] Brown said the LIE what lie the lie that
[57:42] thou shalt not surely die the lie that
[57:46] they all might be damned who believed
[57:48] not the truth but that pleasure in
[57:52] unrighteousness and there's that mystery
[57:54] of iniquity what he that Antichrist
[57:55] spirit that hides what's he what's he
[57:57] doing he's hiding in the heart of an
[57:59] unregenerate religious man and really
[58:02] nail it down what it is it's an anointed
[58:04] one as well as right as well as even
[58:07] after you're born again the iniquity
[58:09] that continue to influence these you
[58:11] continues to influence a born- again
[58:13] believer in their Spirit realm after
[58:16] their conversion that's
[58:19] right like somebody getting caught up in
[58:21] false Doctrine and then coming back God
[58:23] will lead them back caught up in the
[58:25] seventh under Doctrine or something like
[58:27] that and then then they lean
[58:29] back or talking behind somebody's back
[58:33] when you know you're not supposed to
[58:34] talk behind somebody's back or looking
[58:36] at circumstances like Peter did looking
[58:38] at the winds and the waves when you know
[58:40] you ain't you're supposed to look at
[58:41] God's word or doubting God's promises
[58:44] like Sarah like giggling in the tent oh
[58:46] but God wants us to hold true to his
[58:48] promises God's going to have a church
[58:50] like that that's balanced and true an
[58:53] antichrist spirit comes in the form of
[58:55] religion I I I I don't want to be
[58:58] churchy I don't want to have no
[58:59] churchianity in it you know sometimes
[59:01] brother R talked about how you can get
[59:02] one another Spirit you can get the
[59:03] pastor's Spirit you get like a church
[59:05] Spirit but I don't want a religious
[59:07] spirit I want I want we'll say the bride
[59:10] spirit I want the spirit of Christ and
[59:12] Christ is the word you know so anything
[59:15] anything
[59:16] Antichrist would have to be anti- word
[59:19] so that means anything anything that's
[59:22] off the word anything that's not correct
[59:25] in this Doctrine would have had to come
[59:27] from the
[59:29] Antichrist anything you hold that is
[59:31] contrary to Christ is
[59:33] Antichrist anything any doctrine that is
[59:36] incorrect is Antichrist amen now you
[59:38] think about and what are we talking
[59:40] about tonight how do I get rid of all
[59:42] that false Doctrine how do I get rid of
[59:44] that you're going to get rid of it by
[59:46] the word amen word upon word here a
[59:49] little there a little precept upon
[59:50] precept adding up building up little
[59:52] blocks in your life you are built up as
[59:54] Lively Lively ston ye are built up the
[59:57] world being built up in you and as it's
[59:59] built up it's pushing out pushing out
[1:00:02] everything every influence of the devil
[1:00:05] cuz we're talking about theight
[1:00:06] influence the devil could maybe the
[1:00:08] devil's influencing you right now to
[1:00:10] think about that pot of beans on or
[1:00:12] whatever think about that that good food
[1:00:15] you got at home or maybe a good book you
[1:00:17] got on the laying there on the night
[1:00:18] stand you want to get home to or all
[1:00:20] sorts of things and the devil's the
[1:00:22] devil's constantly trying to pull you
[1:00:24] and influence you away from the word but
[1:00:26] think about if you let the word get a
[1:00:28] hold of your
[1:00:29] life and the word begin to influence you
[1:00:33] you think you see what the word does the
[1:00:35] word is like a it's an Avenue for the
[1:00:38] spirit to move and the spirit to have
[1:00:40] Liberty in your life as you believe the
[1:00:42] word the spirit is loosed in your life
[1:00:46] now there's the recipe for how to get
[1:00:48] born again if you want to be born again
[1:00:50] tonight just let the word have Liberty
[1:00:53] in your life as the word is is being
[1:00:54] preached as you un open the the Bible
[1:00:57] maybe there at night before you go to
[1:00:59] bed open it up and begin to read to the
[1:01:01] pages and you'll say well I don't
[1:01:03] understand I don't understand what it's
[1:01:05] talking about but let slowly and surely
[1:01:07] it begins to have a grip on your life
[1:01:10] and as you something will strike as you
[1:01:12] read that and you'll say I believe
[1:01:14] it that's something I know that that's
[1:01:17] true and you watch if something don't
[1:01:20] come rushing in it's a spirit loosed on
[1:01:22] your life and you see that that same
[1:01:26] process just keeps unfolding and
[1:01:28] unfolding as the more word that you hear
[1:01:31] and the more word that you receive until
[1:01:33] finally it becomes a super anointing and
[1:01:36] that super anointing unfolds and unfolds
[1:01:38] until finally there's going to come an
[1:01:41] anointing that will change the very
[1:01:43] molecules of your body now see see why
[1:01:46] that first seal is so important I I hope
[1:01:49] it's becoming plain to you tonight the
[1:01:51] first seal reveals what iniquity is and
[1:01:54] what the mystery of iniquity is and how
[1:01:56] how it reveals how do I give the devil
[1:01:59] the boot how how do I get that devil out
[1:02:02] of me not just out of my soul but out of
[1:02:05] my spirit out of my whole being how do I
[1:02:07] get rid of that thing and the seventh
[1:02:09] seal unfolds until finally the seven the
[1:02:13] the Thunder can be revealed which
[1:02:14] reveals to you that it's gone it's all
[1:02:17] gone and and that shows that you're
[1:02:19] going in the
[1:02:21] Rapture what in Luke Chapter 11
[1:02:25] just think think about the word being
[1:02:27] able to kick the devil out in Luke 11
[1:02:29] Jesus said if I with the Finger of God
[1:02:32] cast out Devils no doubt the kingdom of
[1:02:35] God has come upon you when a strong man
[1:02:38] armed keepeth his Palace his goods are
[1:02:40] in peace but when a stronger than he
[1:02:43] shall come upon him when the strong man
[1:02:45] comes when God comes to the house he
[1:02:48] going to kick the devil out when a
[1:02:50] stronger than he shall come upon him and
[1:02:52] overcome him he taketh from him all his
[1:02:54] armor wherein he trusted and divided his
[1:02:57] spoils the word is stronger than any
[1:03:00] devil oh you want to have power over the
[1:03:02] devil in your life just quote speak the
[1:03:05] word let the word have preeminence in
[1:03:07] your life if you'll let him Christ if
[1:03:09] you'll let him Christ will come and take
[1:03:13] over you think about think about though
[1:03:15] to be anti- word to be anti- word is to
[1:03:18] be anti- Jesus that's right absolutely
[1:03:21] to be anti- word is to be
[1:03:23] Antichrist because the spirit and the
[1:03:25] word are one if you are anti- word you
[1:03:28] will have to be Antichrist sir and if it
[1:03:31] started in the first church it will have
[1:03:32] to grow until the end when it takes over
[1:03:35] and it just becomes Satan Satan's Eden
[1:03:38] yes sir but God's going to have a little
[1:03:39] bride that allows the word to just take
[1:03:42] over and take over her life one word off
[1:03:45] is Antichrist one word off is anti- but
[1:03:49] if you're just word upon word and you
[1:03:51] become the word as you hear the word
[1:03:53] until you are the fullness all the bride
[1:03:57] together the fullness of God made bodily
[1:04:00] and you you see how you can just you
[1:04:02] keep repeating that to somebody don't
[1:04:03] you realize who you are don't you
[1:04:04] realize who you are but when God reveals
[1:04:06] it to you it's different then it it's
[1:04:09] different than somebody just telling it
[1:04:11] to you over and over again
[1:04:21] true look at that Antichrist spirit
[1:04:24] Spirit working to come against the
[1:04:25] movement of the Holy
[1:04:27] Ghost and that in that early church age
[1:04:29] the nickan spirit and we're just kind of
[1:04:32] kind of maybe hurrying through some of
[1:04:33] these things here as we're about to
[1:04:35] close that nickan Spirits brother R said
[1:04:38] never mind what God's word says you
[1:04:40] can't understand it we have to interpret
[1:04:42] it to you but you think about you can
[1:04:45] understand amen God wants to reveal
[1:04:47] himself to you think about that nician
[1:04:50] Spirit coming against coming against the
[1:04:52] liberty of the holy ghost moving in
[1:04:53] people's lives to make them think they
[1:04:55] couldn't understand it when you can
[1:04:57] understand it and you can have a direct
[1:04:59] relationship with God he said they
[1:05:02] oppressed the People by Leading them
[1:05:04] into and binding them to organization
[1:05:07] based upon the Creeds and Dogma which
[1:05:09] they taught the people instead of the
[1:05:11] pure word of God sir you know it's the
[1:05:13] clergy's job to hold the word over the
[1:05:15] people it's the clergy's job the the the
[1:05:18] preacher's job to preach the word and
[1:05:20] and then watch God do the rest it's it's
[1:05:24] not my job to make somebody repent it's
[1:05:26] my job to preach the word and then God
[1:05:28] will God will move on their heart and
[1:05:29] make them repent it's not my job to make
[1:05:32] somebody be a Christian I I could beat
[1:05:34] somebody over head with a rolled up
[1:05:35] newspaper all day long and it's not
[1:05:37] going to make them be a Christian it's
[1:05:39] my God to pre my my job to preach the
[1:05:41] word it's not my job to drag somebody to
[1:05:43] church but you watch the god get a hold
[1:05:44] of them and they'll be sitting there on
[1:05:46] the Pew and rejoicing along with
[1:05:48] everybody else it's our responsibility
[1:05:50] to preach the gospel and then do what
[1:05:52] watch God back it up because that's what
[1:05:54] the word the word the word was given to
[1:05:57] us to loose the spirit in our lives it's
[1:06:00] his Spirit that's doing the work it's
[1:06:02] the spirit that can change lives it's
[1:06:04] God that blesses amen but the devil has
[1:06:08] his false prophets oh yeah
[1:06:11] am I'm trying to get to a place
[1:06:17] here trying to run through my Andrew
[1:06:20] Glover can do this faster skip through
[1:06:22] his notes
[1:06:24] I'm not I'm not like
[1:06:26] that thank you thank you
[1:06:29] brother after the bride I think now
[1:06:31] after the bride is taken away that
[1:06:33] scripture we were reading then this man
[1:06:35] of sin will reveal himself am the spirit
[1:06:38] becomes greater and greater until it
[1:06:40] takes over but there's a little group
[1:06:43] that has packed away the word they've
[1:06:45] got plenty of fuel to keep the fire
[1:06:47] burning amen Amen brother round and you
[1:06:50] know when he was preaching pretty much
[1:06:51] all the seals he just kept constantly
[1:06:52] referring back to the to the the foolish
[1:06:54] virgin he said the bridegroom call went
[1:06:56] out in the seventh watch and then the
[1:06:58] sleeping virgin come rubbed her eyes and
[1:07:01] said suppose I ought to have some of
[1:07:03] that old too so maybe we'd better have
[1:07:05] some some of that some of that word that
[1:07:08] will loose the spirit the old is the
[1:07:10] spirit how you going to get the spirit
[1:07:12] the word it's the same it's all wrapped
[1:07:14] up together and the real true B bride
[1:07:17] standing there say we have just got
[1:07:19] enough for oursel we just got enough in
[1:07:21] to get in oursel we can't give you
[1:07:23] nothing
[1:07:24] if you want some you go pray up pray
[1:07:27] that God will reveal himself to you
[1:07:29] there's a real true bride that has
[1:07:31] loaded up with oil cuz she knows what
[1:07:35] that's going to do she's got a
[1:07:37] revelation of that power she loves the
[1:07:40] word she's in love with the word and
[1:07:41] she's it she it's doing something in her
[1:07:44] life so she loaded it up because she
[1:07:45] ain't foolish and she's made herself
[1:07:49] ready brother said the bride could go
[1:07:51] home and you never know nothing about it
[1:07:54] right he said that's true somebody said
[1:07:55] well brother Brown that would be a
[1:07:56] mighty small group if there was 800
[1:07:59] winning the Rapture tonight you never
[1:08:02] hear a word about it tomorrow or the
[1:08:04] next day or no other time he said be
[1:08:08] ready watching every minute quick your
[1:08:11] quit your nonsense just get down to
[1:08:14] business with God because it's later
[1:08:16] than you think now if he could say that
[1:08:19] back then what can we say tonight that
[1:08:21] surely is later than we think
[1:08:25] that's the reason brother R said Christ
[1:08:27] has to stay on the mediatorial seat back
[1:08:29] there as an intercessor just hang on
[1:08:31] with me just for a few more moments
[1:08:32] we'll be closing in a minute until that
[1:08:34] last one comes in at the last stage and
[1:08:36] these Revelations then these Revelations
[1:08:39] then there at the last of what it has
[1:08:42] been breaks forth upon the people and
[1:08:46] they see what happened brother now
[1:08:48] that's what we're doing sitting here in
[1:08:50] church on a Wednesday night we're
[1:08:52] Longing To not just see what happened
[1:08:54] down through the seven Church ages but
[1:08:57] to see what's happened in our own lives
[1:09:00] now there's what's revealed in the Seven
[1:09:03] Seals when you look back and see what
[1:09:05] God has done God think about now that
[1:09:08] God wants you to see what happened amen
[1:09:12] that's what's going to give you Rapture
[1:09:13] in faith God wants you to remember
[1:09:17] remember all The Crucible the times of
[1:09:19] beating the strange things that were
[1:09:21] said the hurtful things remember all
[1:09:24] that your experience remember when you
[1:09:26] were first born again remember when you
[1:09:29] grew remember it just piling on remember
[1:09:32] how your character was changed to make
[1:09:34] you to make you his
[1:09:37] Queen that's why in Revelation chapter 6
[1:09:40] verse one it says and I saw when the
[1:09:43] lamb opened one of the seals and I heard
[1:09:46] as it were the noise of Thunder one of
[1:09:49] the four Beast saying come and see come
[1:09:52] come take a look at this right come and
[1:09:54] see come and see what God has made
[1:09:57] you come and see how God kicked the
[1:10:00] devil out come and see how God kicked
[1:10:02] the devil out of your life come and see
[1:10:05] how Satan is a bluff come and see how
[1:10:08] you ain't a bluff come and see how you
[1:10:11] stand for something and when you speak
[1:10:13] the word it actually does something now
[1:10:16] to think tonight about how if you're a
[1:10:18] real godall minister to know that the
[1:10:20] word that you speak will actually have
[1:10:22] an impact on people's Liv lies because
[1:10:24] you ain't a Blu to sit see there sitting
[1:10:27] there as as a real born again Christian
[1:10:29] to know that you're really a real
[1:10:32] borning in Christian because God has
[1:10:34] revealed it to you not just cuz somebody
[1:10:35] pumped you up and slapped you on the
[1:10:37] back and said a lot of good things about
[1:10:39] you to to know that you ain't a faker
[1:10:43] come and see come and see God is veiled
[1:10:45] in your flesh God veil in my flesh come
[1:10:48] and see the mystery of one God come and
[1:10:51] look into the book and see come and see
[1:10:53] that mystery of iniquity right away now
[1:10:56] that's what what do we want to see come
[1:10:58] and see the Queen of Heaven that's been
[1:11:01] made spotless by the lamb brother R said
[1:11:04] in the first seal he said some church
[1:11:06] today calls her the Queen of Heaven the
[1:11:08] Queen of Heaven is the selected bride of
[1:11:11] Christ and she comes with him and he
[1:11:13] started talking about that queen of Shea
[1:11:15] the queen of the South that would come
[1:11:16] up she she found she found what was
[1:11:19] really important in her life and she
[1:11:21] loaded up camels and went on a long J
[1:11:23] why cuz she knew that that word of God
[1:11:26] meant something to you and if you can
[1:11:28] look back in your life and remember how
[1:11:30] the word first gripped you and it kept
[1:11:32] gripping you and gripping you and
[1:11:34] changing you day by day just like that
[1:11:37] Queen when she got to the feet of
[1:11:39] Solomon and she'd listen to Solomon
[1:11:41] talking could you imagine sitting there
[1:11:42] and hearing the things coming out of
[1:11:44] Solomon's mouth and she my goodness
[1:11:46] where how does he know these things how
[1:11:48] does where did you get this kind of
[1:11:50] information and that's just how you and
[1:11:52] I are when we turn on the sermon sitting
[1:11:55] there in our car maybe when we wake up
[1:11:57] laying there at night you know sometimes
[1:11:59] I come down in the morning I hear my
[1:12:01] wife playing brother brandom and and you
[1:12:03] know it's it's just like that Queen of
[1:12:05] Sheba listening to to Solomon you hear
[1:12:08] the same wisdom because the same one
[1:12:11] that spoke through Solomon spoke through
[1:12:13] brother brandham and is speaking still
[1:12:16] speaking through his through the
[1:12:18] ministry
[1:12:19] today he said not even a Jew came up
[1:12:22] with that generation that was Jews yeah
[1:12:25] and they were blind and missed him there
[1:12:27] that great Queen humble herself and come
[1:12:29] and accepted the message and the Queen
[1:12:32] of Sheba wasn't foolish and you believe
[1:12:35] you believe tonight that that same one
[1:12:37] that spoke through Solomon that same one
[1:12:38] is still able to speak you know in the
[1:12:41] Book of Revelation so many people get
[1:12:42] confused by that that John actually he
[1:12:44] bowed down to that one that said I
[1:12:46] behold I come quickly and he said don't
[1:12:48] bow down to me and so many people get
[1:12:50] confused by you but you know he said I
[1:12:53] of thy Brethren the prophets and in the
[1:12:55] book of Hebrews it says that God many
[1:12:58] times and many ways spoke through the
[1:13:00] fathers through the prophets and you
[1:13:02] wouldn't bow down to a prophet but it
[1:13:05] was God speaking through him nonetheless
[1:13:07] and that same God that spoke through
[1:13:09] Solomon that same God spoke through Paul
[1:13:12] that same God spoke through brother Ram
[1:13:13] you wouldn't bow down to brother
[1:13:14] brandham or you wouldn't bow down to
[1:13:16] Solomon but it was God speaking through
[1:13:18] him nonetheless and that same God is
[1:13:21] still speaking in this day speaking
[1:13:24] through a five-fold Ministry if you
[1:13:26] could recognize it thank God that God
[1:13:28] has given us the ability to listen and
[1:13:30] to be able to hear and recognize and
[1:13:33] that it's not just a bunch of noise and
[1:13:35] not just a bunch of Thunder not just a
[1:13:36] bunch of clapping and rolling thunder
[1:13:38] but we can hear the voice of God when he
[1:13:41] speaks to us that Queen of Sheba wasn't
[1:13:44] foolish you know what foolish means it
[1:13:48] means a decision or behavior that lacks
[1:13:52] good sense judgment or wisdom and I tell
[1:13:56] you what lacks good what what I tell you
[1:13:58] what would make good sense is to follow
[1:14:00] after this word and cleave to it with
[1:14:02] everything that you got if you're not
[1:14:04] born again tonight run to it as quick as
[1:14:07] you can run to it and how how are you
[1:14:09] going to get born again tonight by the
[1:14:11] word how you going to get access to the
[1:14:13] blood of the Lamb by the word the blood
[1:14:15] the word is what gives us access to his
[1:14:17] Spirit brother R said remember when that
[1:14:20] foolish virgin went to buy oil when they
[1:14:21] come back the bride was done gone and
[1:14:23] the door was shut and they knocked and
[1:14:25] said let us in let us in but they were
[1:14:29] in outer Darkness cuz they were foolish
[1:14:32] all that time they were running around
[1:14:34] nor you see you'd have a lamp and then
[1:14:36] you'd have a little pouch that you'd
[1:14:37] fill up with oil and all that time they
[1:14:39] were running around thinking that
[1:14:41] they're that that they had what were
[1:14:43] they thinking you don't have any oil in
[1:14:46] your pouch you're not carrying it right
[1:14:49] iniquity iniquity to know and to know
[1:14:53] that you need to be born
[1:14:55] again you know that you must be born
[1:14:58] again amen you must be born
[1:15:01] again you must be born
[1:15:04] again don't let the devil tell you you
[1:15:06] can't have
[1:15:07] it it's your promise as the musicians
[1:15:11] come forward you must be born
[1:15:14] again I saw and behold a white horse and
[1:15:17] he that sat on him had a bow and a crown
[1:15:20] was given unto him and he went forth
[1:15:22] conquer
[1:15:24] and to conquer this fellow That's mighty
[1:15:27] mighty and his conquering power but how
[1:15:30] is he going to conquer with no errors
[1:15:33] you see the only weapon right that this
[1:15:35] guy has is has is his deception yep he's
[1:15:39] trying to
[1:15:40] deceive and the only way that you can
[1:15:43] combat that deception is by the word of
[1:15:45] God the word of God drives out the
[1:15:49] deception y right God bless you Saints

[1:23:25] all of his lies you've got the antidote
