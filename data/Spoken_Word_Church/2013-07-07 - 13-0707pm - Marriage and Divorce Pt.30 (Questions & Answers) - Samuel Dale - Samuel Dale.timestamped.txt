[15:56] in Jesus name
[15:57] amen
[15:59] Romans
[16:01] 7.
[16:06] no you're not bred in for I speak to
[16:08] them that know the law
[16:11] how that the law had dominion over a man
[16:13] as long as he liveth
[16:15] where the woman which hath and husband
[16:17] is bound by the law to her husband as
[16:19] long as he liveth but if the husband be
[16:21] dead she's loose from the law of her
[16:24] husband
[16:25] so then if while her husband liveth
[16:27] she'd be married to another man she
[16:29] shall be called an adulteress but if her
[16:31] husband be dead she is free from that
[16:33] law so that she is no adulteress though
[16:36] she be married to another man
[16:39] or for my brethren you are all ye also
[16:42] are become dead to the law how now by
[16:45] the body of Christ that you should be
[16:47] married to another even to him who is
[16:49] raised from the dead that we should
[16:51] bring forth fruit unto God
[16:54] or when we were in the flesh the Motions
[16:56] of sin which were by the law
[16:58] did work in our members to bring forth
[17:00] fruit unto death
[17:01] but now we are delivered from the law
[17:03] that being dead we're in we were held
[17:06] that we should serve in the newness of
[17:08] spirit and not in the oldness of the
[17:12] letter now let's go over to John 8.
[17:17] 31 30 while you're getting there and he
[17:20] spake these words and words
[17:22] as he spake these words many believed on
[17:25] him then said Jesus to those Jews which
[17:28] believed on him if you continued my word
[17:30] then you are my disciples indeed you
[17:33] shall know the truth and the truth shall
[17:34] make you free they answered him we be
[17:37] Abraham's seed
[17:39] and we're never in bondage to any man
[17:40] what about being in they were in natural
[17:42] bondage to the Romans right
[17:46] ruling over them at that time but yet
[17:49] they didn't account that because they
[17:51] believed they were the people of God and
[17:52] no matter what was going on they weren't
[17:55] in bondage to no man so look at him and
[17:58] they answered we'd be Abraham's seed and
[18:00] we're never in bondage to any man houses
[18:02] thou ye shall be free Jesus answered
[18:05] them verily verily I say unto you
[18:09] whosoever committeth sin is the servant
[18:11] of sin
[18:13] and the server divide us not in the
[18:14] house forever but the son abideth
[18:17] forever if the son therefore shall make
[18:20] you free you shall be free indeed you
[18:24] may be seated the Lord that is blessing
[18:26] to the reading of the word right
[18:30] and you shall know the truth
[18:32] the truth will make you free
[18:35] I thank God for the truth
[18:37] but you know
[18:39] a lot of times it hurts
[18:41] right I mean there's no need of worrying
[18:45] about it or thinking about it you say
[18:46] well it didn't hurt me yes it did
[18:49] when you first heard it it hurt because
[18:51] it cuts
[18:53] it's a sharp two-edged sword and it cuts
[18:55] going both ways and it does hurt a lot
[18:58] of times but you know I'm doing but I
[19:00] hope you've enjoyed this series that
[19:03] I've tried to bring forth on marriage
[19:04] and divorce and then getting on over
[19:07] into me the greater things as the
[19:10] prophet said in the invisible Union that
[19:12] Romans 7 referred to a greater portion
[19:15] of marriage and divorce
[19:18] now a greater portion he said of
[19:20] marriage and divorce in other words
[19:21] something greater than marriage and
[19:23] divorce
[19:24] because you wouldn't speak on a greater
[19:25] portion unless as you were talking about
[19:27] something greater
[19:29] all right and it's like I said this
[19:31] morning
[19:32] the new birth is the most important
[19:34] thing
[19:35] to you and I right now to get that
[19:37] straight
[19:39] well we want to get our marital
[19:41] situation straight give us some kind of
[19:43] a rabbit hat trick you know or or tell
[19:46] us something that we can get these
[19:47] things straightened out by
[19:49] uh I'm sorry I don't have any
[19:51] you know all I have is to believe the
[19:55] word and I leave it up strictly to you
[19:57] because you and God Alone can can work
[20:00] out your sins uh I cannot be your uh
[20:05] Pope
[20:06] uh you know to tell you that uh you're
[20:09] okay because what good would that be it
[20:13] might wind up and be like the lady you
[20:14] remember brother Branham referred to
[20:16] that come down to the dying hour and
[20:18] then she started telling the preachers
[20:19] that you lied to me
[20:21] you know well I don't want to get in
[20:23] that situation
[20:24] and so the best thing for you to do is
[20:27] to you to seek God that's reason I can't
[20:29] tell you if you have the new birth
[20:32] the only person today that I know has
[20:34] got the new birth is me
[20:37] right
[20:39] he said well well that's putting it down
[20:41] now that's just what it is you got to
[20:43] say that I thought you believe the
[20:45] prophet you want the quote he said if
[20:47] there's anyone going I'm the only ones
[20:49] going
[20:50] wasn't that the way he said it you got
[20:52] to believe you're the one because it's
[20:54] not for a group this is not an
[20:56] organizational situation it's an
[20:58] organism around the world of the body of
[21:01] Jesus Christ all right then in doing
[21:03] that we must each one personally have
[21:06] our own experience
[21:07] right you must have the new the new
[21:10] birth because if you don't have the new
[21:12] bird then you're not even in line of
[21:14] anything because we are not natural Jews
[21:17] of any form
[21:18] they would even be in line for the
[21:20] Covenant but yet even in this day the
[21:22] natural Jew has no line to go Paul said
[21:25] it's not a Jew that says you outwardly
[21:27] but a Jew that's a Jew inwardly by the
[21:30] new birth all right
[21:32] so if we can see it though we can really
[21:34] believe it
[21:36] that that old husband of our natural
[21:39] adamic nature that's the best way to say
[21:42] it because it means the way we came the
[21:44] way we were born this whole world is an
[21:47] adamic nature because of the Fall In the
[21:50] Garden it is the domain of Satan and in
[21:54] doing that it is through the basis it
[21:57] has to be dealt with now I'm going to
[21:59] comment for a little while and then
[22:00] we're going to have questions and
[22:01] answers
[22:02] all right now I don't mind some like
[22:04] sister Susan likes to ask in the Bible
[22:07] study
[22:08] I want to ask this for a friend of mine
[22:13] I don't mind that either if you want to
[22:16] say it that away but she will do that
[22:18] sometimes she said A friend of mine
[22:20] wants to know
[22:23] we'll go that away whatever you ask I'll
[22:26] do the best I can to tell you that
[22:28] whatever I can tell you but then it
[22:31] don't bother me to say I don't know
[22:32] right so you know as people ask me
[22:35] questions and I'll just say I don't know
[22:38] the Aaron back there the first time he
[22:39] called me he thought I was such an
[22:41] intellectual years ago he'd heard so
[22:43] much about me how great intellect I was
[22:45] and and everything else and he was
[22:48] amazed because he asked me a question
[22:49] and I couldn't answer it
[22:51] well he went around telling everybody he
[22:53] said brother Dale couldn't answer that
[22:54] question well there was no need of
[22:56] playing around I didn't know the answer
[22:58] because it's just the truth you know
[23:01] let's be what we are all right but now
[23:03] write your questions down your thoughts
[23:05] comments
[23:06] and all like that because I'd like to
[23:08] hear from you
[23:10] see I don't believe the new birth
[23:13] sets you free from your marital
[23:15] situations of the natural part because
[23:18] it did why would the prophet have to
[23:19] preach it it wouldn't be the binding
[23:22] force of waiting until the end time and
[23:25] he could not preach it until the seals
[23:27] broke
[23:28] that's what he said it was revealed
[23:30] there in the seals all right now
[23:33] then you know we don't have to worry
[23:36] about that we're going into the rest and
[23:38] just be concerned I believe the new
[23:40] birth sets your soul free
[23:43] makes you a born-again Christian
[23:46] and the old nature of that Soul had to
[23:49] die
[23:51] not just a white washed
[23:55] our doings you know when you see a lot
[23:57] of the world doing that that they make a
[24:00] confession
[24:01] but yet you see I'm still just going on
[24:03] living just like they was living before
[24:05] you know
[24:06] and you know they they join a church
[24:08] they're doing little things and you have
[24:10] to go on
[24:11] well you know right real quick that old
[24:13] husband's Not Dead
[24:15] now I have to admit it because it is
[24:18] truth
[24:19] that that old adamic nature
[24:23] whether you believe it or not
[24:25] that's to use because I believe it I
[24:28] believe that old adamic nature is always
[24:30] trying to raise up
[24:34] yeah
[24:36] and you got to keep killing him he said
[24:39] I've killed him a long time ago well why
[24:42] is he keep raising up living
[24:44] I wrote myself a note down you know that
[24:47] people spend more time talking about
[24:50] the past
[24:54] now see if you think I'm right people
[24:56] spend more time talking about the past
[24:58] about what they've done yes
[25:03] then speaking of even what they're doing
[25:06] or even what do we'll do
[25:08] the biggest portion of our conversation
[25:10] is a priced event
[25:12] right
[25:14] we talk about what went on for the week
[25:16] we talk about how long brother Cauley I
[25:18] remember years ago we were coming down
[25:20] the road and it's just a roof she was
[25:22] you just never talked very much
[25:25] and me and my wife was following them
[25:26] back out of Tennessee and I said look
[25:28] look and Peggy said what what what
[25:30] happened I said look
[25:33] brother calling sister Ruth is talking
[25:37] his sister Ruth is coming to the house
[25:40] and said they only take he said what
[25:42] you've been doing
[25:43] so when
[25:44] you make dress
[25:47] she just wasn't one to spend a lot of
[25:49] conversational piece like that in a
[25:52] contrary to most people was thinking
[25:54] that's the way I am you know you know
[25:56] I'm a quiet person on a lot of things
[25:58] but anyhow but we do we spend more time
[26:02] talking about the past
[26:05] than we do about even the Present part
[26:07] of us or even the future
[26:09] because that's kind of the way we're
[26:11] made
[26:12] well see I believe the new birth makes
[26:14] that Soul free
[26:16] and God had to let that old nature die
[26:20] now
[26:22] the point I want you to see is
[26:25] how does he do it then we'll get to the
[26:28] questions and answers
[26:29] how does God let it die
[26:33] see we can go through the uh
[26:36] uh explanation of
[26:39] how the red true red you see white
[26:42] uh we could go through the different
[26:45] things but I still want to know how does
[26:47] God forget
[26:51] that's just my point how does God forget
[26:54] a god that is omniscient
[26:56] which means he knows all things
[26:59] omnipotent
[27:02] even omnipresent in the fact that he's
[27:04] omnipotent or knows to be there
[27:08] now how does he forget
[27:12] what we've done
[27:17] they had to do that or we would not have
[27:19] got the new birth the prophet said
[27:20] invisible Union he said if that old
[27:23] husband wouldn't dead you're not going
[27:24] to get the new birth
[27:26] because you see you just hanging him up
[27:28] there and go back and get him and do it
[27:30] now God won't dwell the Bible says in an
[27:32] unclean vessel
[27:34] so then he wasn't he won't come into
[27:36] your soul in the new birth and birth
[27:38] that soul to that individual well Satan
[27:41] was still living there so he has to go
[27:42] through the process of driving him out
[27:44] cleansing it you know boiling out
[27:47] everything and then the Holy Ghost
[27:48] itself being the fire of God to come in
[27:51] cleanse so then you know God then some
[27:55] way
[27:56] he is able to forget
[28:00] amen
[28:03] and that would be a great ability
[28:06] to be able to forget
[28:08] right because I can't I you know we all
[28:11] have our memories and you can't do it
[28:12] but to get the new birth you've got to
[28:15] you've got to believe that he forgot it
[28:19] and then those things that goes with it
[28:21] of explaining it you know of the red
[28:25] through red you see white
[28:27] those things are the things that come to
[28:31] us to be able to help us understand
[28:35] but see red through red you see white is
[28:38] not a revelation now listen to one word
[28:41] that's a scientific fact
[28:44] all right see then if you can see it
[28:46] it's not a revelation
[28:48] Revelation has to be something that is
[28:51] far greater than any uh scientific fact
[28:54] that you have
[28:56] amen right so then the New Birth has to
[28:58] have God some way let that die right so
[29:01] the best we can say about it is the
[29:03] scripture they're over in Psalms 103
[29:06] verse 12.
[29:07] he said that he would put the
[29:10] remembrance or our sins
[29:13] that would be our transgressions would
[29:15] be removed as far as the East is to the
[29:17] West
[29:19] all right see then there's no
[29:21] calculations you can go north and south
[29:23] and you have a calculation but if you're
[29:26] going east to west either way you go you
[29:29] just keep going because once you get
[29:30] over here you're East you get over there
[29:32] West it's always going to be the same
[29:35] you know no matter what you're
[29:37] stationing on you're going to still be
[29:39] talking of east and west so it just
[29:42] means that it's it's totally gone
[29:45] in the bases that God can put our sins
[29:48] as the prophet would call it then in the
[29:51] sea of his forgetfulness now I like the
[29:54] way he says that in the sea of his
[29:58] forgetfulness
[30:00] right because you and I cannot forget
[30:03] all right
[30:05] the best we try we can't forget
[30:07] but he can
[30:09] he has that ability to seal away
[30:11] something that we have asked him to
[30:14] forgive us
[30:18] see that way then he can let it die
[30:21] and you can receive the new birth all
[30:23] right see then we went in through the
[30:25] marriage and divorce situation of
[30:27] natural things of life
[30:29] and seeing that I believe when that
[30:31] Prophet made that statement that day
[30:34] when he said go on As You Are
[30:38] I believe
[30:40] God put that in to see if his
[30:42] forgetfulness
[30:44] right now if you want to quote for the
[30:46] other parts you can say well it was just
[30:47] a statement that he made but he said
[30:50] that God saw it in the days of Moses
[30:53] in the days of Paul and counted at
[30:55] righteousness
[30:57] now how do you look at a
[31:00] filthiness of mankind
[31:03] and call it righteousness
[31:06] you definitely got to be looking Beyond
[31:09] on the act or the thought that's right
[31:12] if you're going to count it
[31:13] righteousness righteousness means if you
[31:16] look it up righteousness means right
[31:19] right that's where it starts from right
[31:21] being right r-i-g-h-t right then you put
[31:24] the righteousness to it as being a
[31:27] you know way of doing things
[31:30] all right so then he could put that in
[31:32] the sea of his forgetfulness
[31:34] and never to be remembered anymore
[31:37] because it's
[31:39] even though you take
[31:41] uh the scientific side and you would
[31:45] take red and look through red you see
[31:47] white
[31:48] Still You Got The Two Reds to deal with
[31:50] right you understand me
[31:54] you see he don't see any of it that's
[31:56] right it's gone
[32:00] now that's marvelous to me I love it
[32:03] that way
[32:04] I don't have to have all the mechanical
[32:06] understanding I just believe it
[32:09] I believe it's done all right see then I
[32:12] believe that in our in our situation of
[32:15] us now that we're talking about the fact
[32:19] of organized religion
[32:22] and how that organized religion is the
[32:25] cause of all things
[32:26] the reason we needed a new birth was
[32:29] organized religion
[32:31] he said no no no well Eve trying to
[32:34] organize it in the garden
[32:36] messed it up
[32:38] man has always tried to find a way to
[32:40] save himself right is that what the
[32:42] prophet said the reason they chose it in
[32:44] Exodus 19. did not say we're trying to
[32:47] figure it out by giving Hagar to
[32:50] Abraham
[32:52] that's right has not had always been
[32:54] somebody trying to figure out something
[32:55] instead of believing What God Says
[33:01] see then we came up and taking on and
[33:04] speaking about
[33:06] organized religion being
[33:09] man's ideas
[33:12] got a good comment from somebody on a
[33:13] note about it you know enjoyed it's our
[33:16] ideas
[33:19] that are contrary to God's word
[33:22] that's what organized religion is
[33:25] it don't have to be a whole group of
[33:27] people it's just us ourselves
[33:29] and see as long as we doubt the word of
[33:32] God
[33:35] then you know as we're talking about it
[33:38] life's not about the Rapture everybody's
[33:40] wondering about the rapture
[33:42] I told him I said first we got to deal
[33:44] with one thing
[33:45] this is the first got to be a
[33:47] resurrection right
[33:50] then there's got to be a change
[33:53] and then a rapture
[33:55] yeah
[33:57] and we got to deal with it in that order
[34:00] that's right of the first the
[34:03] resurrection
[34:05] because it can't be a change until the
[34:07] dead erase
[34:08] all right then dealing with a change
[34:12] and that's brother Randall said what is
[34:15] that great mystery of the translation
[34:18] he says what he said just to change
[34:22] now what about you asked Amana I um
[34:28] a question that the world would be
[34:31] concerned about
[34:34] and he says just to change
[34:36] then he proceeds to explain his
[34:38] explanation
[34:40] oh he's like a mother with a baby
[34:44] and her come into the place of desire
[34:46] and things at the end and that means
[34:49] something's close there getting ready
[34:51] it's easiest to change
[34:54] you thank them theologians sitting there
[34:56] for
[34:58] we worried about that all of our life in
[35:00] all of our school we studied it at War
[35:02] and this man says it's just a challenge
[35:06] that's what it was that's what it'll be
[35:10] it'd just be a change all right we got
[35:13] to go through the order to come to that
[35:15] all right but now get it
[35:18] see we've got to see
[35:21] for the new birth that old husband did
[35:24] we got to reckon that or count that in
[35:27] our thinking
[35:29] all right
[35:30] now we've got to reckon or count within
[35:32] our marital life
[35:36] the the things that we are
[35:39] problems brought on by organized
[35:41] religion
[35:43] and see that those things are white
[35:46] slate clean
[35:47] by the prophet
[35:49] you said the prophet no no it was the
[35:52] words of the man
[35:55] of a firm believer and wrote around him
[35:58] speaking the word
[35:59] I believe it like this when he got into
[36:01] the Rapture message if you'll notice it
[36:03] he said
[36:05] it has been spoken
[36:08] now let it come to pass
[36:11] you realize nobody even the Apostle Paul
[36:14] with even the prophecy that he made of
[36:16] it but yet he never explained
[36:19] those things
[36:21] I don't believe it'd ever be a Rapture
[36:22] if his Prophet hadn't to come to speak
[36:25] the word unto us that's my dependence is
[36:28] upon that all right now then I believe
[36:31] that when he spoke
[36:34] of the marriage and divorce he spoke in
[36:36] the first person
[36:37] all done it Moses done it
[36:40] spoke in the first person
[36:43] to bring God's word to you and I
[36:46] but we must believe that
[36:49] that's why it's not for everybody
[36:51] all right then we got down to organized
[36:54] religion
[36:55] and that's the thing that we're going to
[36:57] deal have to deal with in our life
[37:00] that old husband of organized religion
[37:02] which is our ideas and thoughts
[37:06] God will have to let it die amen all
[37:09] right
[37:12] now
[37:13] if it's right what we read this morning
[37:15] and I believe it
[37:17] in the Feast of the trumpets
[37:21] where the prophet of God said the Holy
[37:23] Ghost
[37:23] had been bound for almost two thousand
[37:25] years
[37:27] at the door of Creeds and dogmas
[37:29] but was promised to be loosed
[37:32] by the end time message
[37:36] I like it that way
[37:39] not even by the man but the end time
[37:41] message to take his message and walked
[37:43] her in
[37:44] all right
[37:46] now if that's true
[37:49] how does God let
[37:53] that old husband
[37:55] die or makes him where he has no more
[38:00] uh control over us
[38:05] how does he do that this is just a
[38:07] comment now and then we'll open up for
[38:09] questions and answers
[38:13] I believe the key is in each thing must
[38:16] tie together
[38:18] uh remember we put a couple of messages
[38:20] on the
[38:22] um
[38:23] prophecy
[38:25] that a prophecy p-r-o-p-h-e-c-y
[38:28] the Rope actually s y means someone is
[38:31] speaking the prophets went out and spoke
[38:33] that was the
[38:36] prophecy Sy
[38:38] but the when you put it p r o p h e c y
[38:41] that means all of those prophets had
[38:45] could be brought together and summed up
[38:47] in showing God in human flesh
[38:52] because the prophets gave birth to Jesus
[38:55] Christ
[38:57] so then the whole Bible would be a
[38:59] prophecy p r o p h e s y c y
[39:02] brought To Us by a prophet that would be
[39:06] speaking it with the s y
[39:08] all right
[39:09] but yet it would be a compiling of the
[39:12] entire Bible
[39:16] right
[39:18] a tying together of all of the Loose
[39:20] Ends is that the words of the prophet
[39:24] what this end time messenger was to do
[39:27] and
[39:29] to bring to you and I
[39:33] the revealed word of God
[39:36] now
[39:38] I believe the new birth
[39:40] is a revelation of Jesus Christ the
[39:43] prophet said Christ The Mystery of God
[39:45] reveal what is the new birth he says
[39:47] it's Revelation Jesus Christ personally
[39:49] to you
[39:50] all right what did he say
[39:53] um
[39:54] it's about I can't remember the page
[39:56] number but I'll be led this he said you
[39:58] can't be saved without a revelation
[40:04] there's no way to be saved without a
[40:05] revelation
[40:07] because that's what it is that's what a
[40:08] revelation is
[40:10] a revelation is God speaking personally
[40:13] to you
[40:14] amen now not a revelation about
[40:16] something you can have a revelation of
[40:18] being healed and get healed and be lost
[40:22] but when you come to the soul of that
[40:24] individual
[40:26] I believe the new birth is the birth of
[40:28] the word
[40:29] no matter then what age you would be in
[40:32] it would be the birth of the word
[40:34] in Luther's age it was not a birth of
[40:37] the end time message
[40:39] it was a birth of the just you live by
[40:41] faith
[40:42] all right
[40:44] so then every age would have a portion
[40:46] of the word
[40:48] and that would make that whole bringing
[40:51] together to be that you and I would
[40:54] receive the revelation of the entire
[40:56] word
[40:57] all right I believe it's a revelation
[41:00] that you're birthed by
[41:04] I believe it's like the prophet said on
[41:06] marriage and divorce
[41:08] he said I believe it's that our
[41:10] invisible union he said if you get a
[41:12] revelation that's your wife
[41:15] he said that's your wife for life
[41:19] now somebody married four or five times
[41:20] could tell you I got a revelation each
[41:23] one of these is mine
[41:25] right I don't work too much
[41:29] we're not stupid maybe a little dumb not
[41:32] stupid
[41:33] huh
[41:35] see he said when you get a revelation
[41:40] some of the things brother said would
[41:42] sometimes it's hard to understand
[41:48] but yet it takes a revelation
[41:51] Julia Birth by revelation
[41:55] you shall know the truth
[41:58] that word no look it up it doesn't mean
[42:02] like I know it means like job said
[42:06] job said I know my redeemer lives
[42:11] all right it was revealed unto him
[42:15] yes
[42:16] I know it's a revelation
[42:19] when you say it's been revealed to you
[42:22] all right
[42:24] then nobody can talk you out of it
[42:25] that's right if they can it's not a
[42:27] revelation
[42:28] that's right that's sensual amen
[42:31] amen
[42:32] so then the new birth is based upon
[42:34] whether or not
[42:36] you can receive a revelation remember
[42:38] the man told around me said I can't
[42:41] receive it no matter what God would do
[42:43] he said it wasn't for you
[42:48] Upon This Rock
[42:50] Jesus said
[42:52] upon this revelation
[42:54] I'll build my church
[42:56] all right
[42:58] so the new birth is a revelation
[43:00] unto you
[43:02] all right now
[43:05] marriage of divorce of Grace would be a
[43:07] revelation unto you
[43:10] that God has revealed to you that you're
[43:12] free
[43:16] it would require revelation
[43:19] but see that Revelation as we were
[43:21] talking about last night
[43:23] that Revelation could not come forth in
[43:25] the days of Luther Wesley or it didn't
[43:28] even come forth for you and I in the
[43:30] days of the Apostle Paul
[43:33] it came forth for those in the days of
[43:35] Paul
[43:37] all right
[43:39] but see then I believe
[43:41] as much as God spoke through Paul
[43:44] to say not I with the Lord and then they
[43:47] say but not the Lord but I say I believe
[43:49] that was God speaking through a man
[43:53] I believe brother Branham God done that
[43:57] come down and spoke through a man's lips
[43:59] to tell you and I
[44:01] about God and then I believe just as
[44:05] much as I believe in one true and living
[44:07] God
[44:09] you know I mean as much as I believe in
[44:11] one true and living God
[44:13] I also believe that his words brought
[44:16] unto us the revelation
[44:19] to set us free
[44:21] if we can believe it
[44:23] no then a pardon is not a pardon unless
[44:26] received is one that's right amen even
[44:28] though you could turn the story around
[44:30] and say the man sitting in jail could
[44:33] sit there with the papers in his hand
[44:35] and he could say I've got a pardon
[44:38] not a pardon this is my paperwork is
[44:41] signed by the president if he didn't
[44:43] walk out on that
[44:47] then
[44:49] they're just leaving sitting in jail
[44:52] right
[44:54] see because he you've got to do
[44:56] something with it
[44:58] all right
[45:00] so you tell me he said Lord revealed me
[45:02] and that's what I've always said you
[45:04] know this statement I've said this no
[45:05] but I don't know how many hundreds of
[45:07] time you show me somebody that comes out
[45:09] of organized religion just because they
[45:12] find out to organize religion is wrong
[45:14] you watch that person
[45:18] they will go back to an organized
[45:20] religion situation or form one of their
[45:22] own
[45:25] think about who you've directed and led
[45:28] and shown the message
[45:30] those that screamed and hollered about
[45:32] the religions being wrong where they at
[45:35] they formed their own religion
[45:38] but those who come out by the revelation
[45:40] of Jesus Christ
[45:42] you'll see them maybe stumbling and
[45:46] bothered a lot but you'll see them
[45:48] walking yes
[45:49] because it can never be taken away from
[45:51] you that is the new birth
[45:54] see then organized religion man's ideas
[45:58] how in the world could you and I get rid
[46:00] of man's ideas
[46:05] now come on it would be just like
[46:07] telling you this is my right hand
[46:10] I hope he got it on the internet system
[46:12] where anybody okay I raised my left hand
[46:14] up and you could say this is my right
[46:16] hand
[46:17] I want you to know that we've been wrong
[46:20] for 6 000 years we've been turned around
[46:23] well now how many is going to believe
[46:25] that
[46:30] you've been taught this is your right
[46:32] hand
[46:35] you've been taught certain things in
[46:38] your life
[46:40] that still controls you
[46:45] right right
[46:49] and that's wonderful
[46:50] to some degrees because it's good things
[46:56] but then when it finally opens up
[46:59] like I said this morning that even the
[47:01] prophet was deceived by organized
[47:03] religion
[47:04] I know people don't like that statement
[47:06] but yet it was true
[47:08] because he said and taught the white
[47:10] horse rider was the Holy Spirit
[47:14] so he was deceived by it but one day the
[47:17] truth came
[47:18] and he was set free right
[47:21] that way you and I could be set free
[47:25] right right and even though Clarence
[47:27] Larkin before brother Branham said the
[47:31] white horse rider was the Antichrist
[47:37] but he wasn't the prophet
[47:40] just as in the days of Martin Luther
[47:42] there were many many people protested
[47:46] the Catholic Church
[47:49] Luther was not the only one he was just
[47:52] but he was the one chosen of God to
[47:55] bring the message
[47:57] now the message then was the important
[47:59] thing
[48:00] not for you to realize organized
[48:02] religion was wrong
[48:05] why is it wrong
[48:12] why is organized religion wrong
[48:16] well you show me one
[48:18] in this message or out of this message
[48:22] that will ever try to lead you to the
[48:24] truth of one true and living God
[48:32] you got the trinities you got the
[48:34] onenesses you got the brand amounts what
[48:36] have you got
[48:40] they don't keep it on one God
[48:43] they're always swaying it some way
[48:47] if nothing else they're hitting the
[48:49] River Jordan
[48:50] one of the latest doctrines that Jesus
[48:52] wasn't God until the River Jordan
[48:55] when the Bible said he was born to
[48:57] Emmanuel
[48:59] well I don't care what you got to say of
[49:01] quotes from then on you can't solve that
[49:04] scripture or annihilate that scripture
[49:09] it doesn't say he would become Emmanuel
[49:13] born this day in the city of David is
[49:15] the savior of Christ the lord
[49:17] and they say one of these days you'll be
[49:19] born you know
[49:22] let's see organized religion then being
[49:24] manned ideas what's going to destroy our
[49:27] ideas
[49:30] all right
[49:32] it used to be said that
[49:35] every tub would sit on its own bottom
[49:38] it's almost older one to hurt them
[49:40] things
[49:42] well let's say
[49:44] you said well it's not in the Bible
[49:49] you know
[49:51] this
[49:52] my grandmother read that
[49:59] you mean my grandmother's wrong
[50:02] no
[50:04] she heard it from Grandma too
[50:10] it's not in the Bible
[50:13] you'll never know
[50:15] never never it's just
[50:17] seasoned except for the shedding of the
[50:19] leaves and the button of the trees my
[50:21] wife had that idea when we him in this
[50:23] message
[50:24] she had heard that
[50:26] you could swear by it because you
[50:28] somebody told you it's not in the Bible
[50:32] that is the way you know the season
[50:35] you know the sadness but
[50:39] better put your seat in the bed of a
[50:41] than to put it in
[50:43] on the ground there's no scripture in
[50:45] the Bible
[50:46] that would justify prostitution
[50:50] but yet people swear by it
[50:53] will you devil said well come on show me
[50:57] where's the time to read the whole Bible
[50:59] I'm just going to tell you what happily
[51:05] you ever heard this one
[51:07] my mama was a Baptist
[51:10] that's my mother that's what she said
[51:12] you know
[51:15] and I'm going to be a Baptist
[51:17] I'll die Baptist
[51:19] because my mama was a Baptist
[51:26] come on
[51:29] the point I'm trying to get is
[51:33] if a man tells me the Bible don't say
[51:35] something and he can prove it
[51:38] I better start changing what I used to
[51:40] believe
[51:42] right right
[51:46] yeah I've had a lot of people tell me
[51:48] say brother run say it so and so
[51:49] unsequently
[51:50] now come and show me where he said it
[51:52] right
[51:53] well I heard it
[51:55] wasn't Brother Ray did Brother Brown
[51:58] said
[51:59] not to go down there and see that movie
[52:01] uh Ten Commandments
[52:06] I said I've searched the message and he
[52:08] has to I can't find it
[52:10] I said but I did find where he said go
[52:12] see Sodom and that's a whole lot worse
[52:15] than ten commandments he said if you
[52:17] want to know what's going on today go
[52:18] see the movie saw them
[52:21] would you see it's our ideas
[52:26] our thoughts but the word of God is Not
[52:29] man's ideas
[52:33] it's not man's ideas about a god
[52:36] is God using man to speak
[52:39] his word
[52:42] and to bring It Forward
[52:44] but yeah we'll fight
[52:46] if I were a quote
[52:49] that we can't produce
[52:52] dinner exclusive but I don't have enough
[52:53] time to search you but I know he said it
[52:55] now
[53:01] you see how blinded we are yes
[53:04] all right
[53:07] how is God going to let our old
[53:11] denominational husband of ideas and
[53:13] thoughts
[53:15] die
[53:24] now
[53:26] to illustrate what I'm talking about
[53:31] the computer is a very
[53:33] damaging product
[53:36] can be used in many ways
[53:38] it's a very valuable product too
[53:42] because you can take
[53:44] that they can take the Bible and put it
[53:46] in the computer and then you can ask
[53:48] that computer for any word in there
[53:51] and if that word's in there the computer
[53:53] will bring it up
[53:54] but if it's not in there the computer
[53:56] gives you zero
[53:58] right
[54:02] see now you can prove if anybody with
[54:04] any sense see
[54:05] sensible people all right now I say the
[54:09] Bible says every trouble sit on what's
[54:11] wrong bottom you go
[54:13] and it says zero
[54:17] that it doesn't exist
[54:22] now if you got no sense you ought to
[54:24] realize you got yourself against the
[54:26] wall
[54:28] when brother moat told me that how many
[54:30] millions of times you heard it and what
[54:32] do you believe me I said I believe in
[54:33] one true and living God
[54:35] he said explain it I said well on the
[54:37] way I can explain it it's gone in three
[54:39] persons Blessed Trinity he said your
[54:42] Justice Trinity as everybody else
[54:44] I didn't get mad storm out bless God I
[54:48] prove it to you
[54:51] he said a person to personality
[54:53] personality is an individual individual
[54:56] is a person your Trinity as well as
[54:58] anybody else I looked dead at him and
[55:00] said it I said don't believe that no
[55:01] more
[55:03] I knew the man had me whooped
[55:07] but what I hate is a third grade
[55:08] education person
[55:11] to explain theology
[55:16] and I'm not meaning theology is good
[55:18] I've just been in a third grade
[55:20] education you can't tell me that four
[55:22] plus four equaled eight
[55:24] all I know is three plus three equals
[55:26] six
[55:30] and see they got no sense to add the
[55:31] rest of it
[55:33] and that's the way we are
[55:36] we will take our thoughts of what we
[55:38] believe
[55:40] about God's word even over what a
[55:43] prophet has to say
[55:45] what do you think all these doctrines or
[55:46] the messages come from
[55:53] come on
[55:55] how many of the people this message
[55:57] believe that brother Brown was God
[55:59] and yet he said if you do that you make
[56:00] me an antichrist
[56:03] Lord is that his statement
[56:05] do you think that corrected anybody
[56:09] no
[56:11] he done that to deceive you
[56:14] I said you've done a good job
[56:17] because I'm deceived enough to believe
[56:19] he didn't know that
[56:23] you understand the point
[56:26] I believe the revealed word
[56:29] is the thing that saves you
[56:32] I believe the revealed word is what sets
[56:34] you free on your marital situation I
[56:36] believe the reveal word is the only
[56:37] thing that can kill them old husbands
[56:43] the revealed word not just somebody's
[56:47] idea
[56:49] I believe it means this well I don't
[56:51] have nothing to do with it that's right
[56:55] I stood before a theologian in this
[56:57] message one day
[56:58] that a man and I'm talking I'm not
[57:01] bragging just telling the truth
[57:03] the man has quoted a scripture
[57:06] and it's in Deuteronomy 24.
[57:09] where it says if a man put away his wife
[57:11] for and he called whatever and said she
[57:13] and she can go be another man's wife may
[57:16] go be another man's wife
[57:22] you see that was going to be the topic
[57:25] that day of marriage and divorce
[57:27] in this old building right over that
[57:29] corner
[57:31] we met before we knew because we knew we
[57:33] were going through that meeting to have
[57:35] the meeting and we had been challenged
[57:37] about marriage and divorce
[57:39] and uh
[57:40] we met and prayed on Friday night before
[57:43] we left on Saturday to go to the meeting
[57:45] and God dropped down that day they're in
[57:48] the corner because see I didn't know
[57:50] what the answer was either
[57:52] and he dropped down in the corner and
[57:54] said just read the rest of the scripture
[57:55] and it'll explain it
[57:58] and when I got there the brother they
[58:00] made their statement and things
[58:02] and I was called to get up I got up went
[58:04] up
[58:06] I said brothers that scripture ain't
[58:08] right
[58:09] the way you're saying it
[58:11] well it's there
[58:15] I said yeah but that ain't what it's
[58:16] saying
[58:19] I said because that would that would be
[58:21] incorrect
[58:22] if he puts her away for any reason how
[58:25] could she go be another man's wife
[58:29] you know and be okay
[58:32] and then I gave him the rest of the
[58:33] scripture where it shows that she can't
[58:35] if she goes to marry that man if that
[58:37] man dies she can't go back to her first
[58:39] husband that's what it says in
[58:40] Deuteronomy
[58:44] let's see I was just enough to do one
[58:46] thing
[58:48] it's called his name I said brother you
[58:49] are a theologian
[58:51] none of that he was a Greek scholar of
[58:53] all kinds
[58:55] and I said which one's right them or me
[59:00] he finally shook his head very fine it's
[59:03] on the tape so we still have
[59:04] and I said let it be known on that Tate
[59:07] that the brother said I was right
[59:10] why because it's the word
[59:12] it's not what we think about it
[59:16] is what God says about it
[59:18] if he can't keep his word straight then
[59:21] he's not god let's eat drink and be
[59:23] merry or tomorrow we die gonna be much
[59:26] of glorified monkeys rolling off of a
[59:28] tree somewhere
[59:34] but you see what I'm getting now yeah
[59:37] if God hadn't spoke to me that day I
[59:39] would have been just like everybody else
[59:41] sitting in that building
[59:44] I wouldn't know this answer
[59:47] but once he spoke it to me I had no fear
[59:50] of who I was facing
[59:54] the man told me later he said I can tear
[59:57] you apart with a word I said you're
[59:59] right
[1:00:00] never bothered me for him to say it
[1:00:03] but he never did attempt because I made
[1:00:05] the challenge
[1:00:07] you get three months
[1:00:10] to explain marriage and divorce we'll
[1:00:12] meet you anywhere in the United States
[1:00:14] but I said I want one meeting
[1:00:17] to speak on marriage and divorce
[1:00:19] we never had another meeting after them
[1:00:24] see when you know where you're right by
[1:00:26] Revelation you have no worries about
[1:00:28] what anybody said now let me ask you a
[1:00:31] simple question
[1:00:34] here has been baptized in the name of
[1:00:36] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:40] yeah
[1:00:42] you know the biggest fortune in the
[1:00:43] building
[1:00:45] is any way I could talk you out of that
[1:00:46] and go back to father son the Holy Ghost
[1:00:49] why
[1:00:53] just because you went and done it
[1:00:58] no it was revealed to you
[1:01:05] it's about to have three no that don't
[1:01:08] work does it
[1:01:12] can anybody talk you out of a revelation
[1:01:14] if they can't it's not around
[1:01:18] that's sensible yes
[1:01:21] man asked me one time my last brother
[1:01:23] brother is there any question we can ask
[1:01:25] you you should change your mind I said
[1:01:27] no
[1:01:28] no question you can ask me to get me to
[1:01:31] change my mind
[1:01:34] I suppose it's revealed
[1:01:38] Hilton
[1:01:41] a revelation is the only thing that can
[1:01:44] make that old husband die
[1:01:46] I hope you get what I'm saying the new
[1:01:49] birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:01:51] personally to you
[1:01:52] right and that is the word alive
[1:01:57] that's why he dies
[1:02:01] the alive word can eradicate
[1:02:04] would you agree
[1:02:05] the live word the reveal word can
[1:02:08] eradicate yes
[1:02:11] you know do away
[1:02:17] until there is nothing left even
[1:02:19] whatsoever
[1:02:24] the revealed word
[1:02:28] put a random on Christ the mystery he
[1:02:30] said is this great Revelation been
[1:02:31] revealed to you
[1:02:34] a three-fold revelation he said when all
[1:02:36] God was he poured into Christ all Christ
[1:02:38] into church and take her back to the
[1:02:39] Garden of Eden
[1:02:40] he said has it been revealed to you
[1:02:46] is there any way that they can deprogram
[1:02:48] you
[1:02:51] are you worried about being captured one
[1:02:53] day and DMD program you
[1:02:57] then you ain't programmed
[1:03:04] there's no way to take a revelation out
[1:03:05] of a person's heart
[1:03:08] Martin Luther when it comes down to it
[1:03:10] you know they said Luther said
[1:03:12] the world would be against you he said
[1:03:15] let the world know I'm against being
[1:03:19] oh
[1:03:21] he put his life on the line
[1:03:25] what about those six of those in the
[1:03:27] millions that were killed
[1:03:30] down through time
[1:03:32] you talk about Jews I'm talking about
[1:03:34] Christians that were killed folks in the
[1:03:36] book of Martyrs
[1:03:39] that they would offer them to recant or
[1:03:41] either throw them into a lion's den
[1:03:46] and they just walked right into the
[1:03:48] lion's den
[1:03:54] yeah we can't even make it to church
[1:03:56] don't worry about the lines then
[1:04:00] right now
[1:04:03] come on
[1:04:05] Lee
[1:04:07] the revealed word
[1:04:09] ye shall know the truth
[1:04:12] it doesn't say you shall know about it
[1:04:18] knowing about this message doesn't set
[1:04:20] you free it really scares you to death
[1:04:22] and binds you because you're scared to
[1:04:24] go that way and you're scared to go that
[1:04:26] way how many remembers it come on
[1:04:29] but they'll walk out of the Baptist
[1:04:30] Church I knew I had to keep going that
[1:04:32] way or he do go back in there and cry
[1:04:34] and beg them to forgive me
[1:04:37] I had my choice
[1:04:43] did you see Church there's a time we've
[1:04:45] got to make a stand
[1:04:47] that old husband can't be dead if the
[1:04:49] word can't be revealed to you and I
[1:04:52] because it takes a reveal word to kill
[1:04:54] it
[1:04:55] now get just a minute and then your
[1:04:57] question
[1:04:58] see then when brother Branham explains
[1:05:00] one God
[1:05:02] then we don't care what the theologians
[1:05:04] say right
[1:05:07] it doesn't matter about all of their
[1:05:09] things if you notice isn't it odd
[1:05:12] that the world now the world
[1:05:16] they don't attack what brother Branham
[1:05:19] taught
[1:05:20] oh yeah they said we don't believe it
[1:05:22] you know we've been
[1:05:26] they know what he taught
[1:05:28] at least come out of the word of God
[1:05:30] but the people of the message that
[1:05:32] claims to be them to be a prophet is the
[1:05:34] ones that attacks what he taught
[1:05:38] isn't that odd
[1:05:42] that the world would think more of the
[1:05:44] man and praise him more than the people
[1:05:46] of the message
[1:05:48] that's all I didn't
[1:05:51] but see the reveal word is the only
[1:05:53] thing that can kill that old husband you
[1:05:55] understand what I'm saying
[1:05:59] so when the prophet taught one God that
[1:06:01] killed that old husband of the trinity
[1:06:05] are you listening
[1:06:08] you know no problem with you
[1:06:11] when the reveal word said hell is not
[1:06:13] eternal
[1:06:18] we don't worry about the theologians and
[1:06:20] what to say do we
[1:06:27] when the prophet through the reveal word
[1:06:29] would say that oh mother of
[1:06:32] Revelation 17 is the Catholic Church
[1:06:36] and the Harlot daughters are the
[1:06:38] Protestants
[1:06:40] do we have any trouble with that
[1:06:43] no
[1:06:44] because we believe it
[1:06:48] what has brought you to where you are
[1:06:50] today
[1:06:54] the old word
[1:06:58] and does it come because of
[1:07:01] who we are or what we're doing
[1:07:04] is it sovereign
[1:07:09] he said Revelation is Sovereign God give
[1:07:11] it to who he wants to
[1:07:20] so then only the reveal word considers
[1:07:23] free
[1:07:28] now you see why
[1:07:31] that I've been the way that I've been
[1:07:36] I've never just left you alone as to
[1:07:39] little six and seven sermons you know
[1:07:41] being good going to church and believe
[1:07:43] the prophet
[1:07:47] I've tried to hold before you
[1:07:49] the word of God
[1:07:52] and preach to you when I could see as I
[1:07:56] brought as I you know studied it
[1:07:59] and then stood to this church stands at
[1:08:01] the bases that there's never been a
[1:08:03] Doctrine came in that broke it up
[1:08:08] some have left because he didn't believe
[1:08:11] right that's that's fine
[1:08:14] but
[1:08:15] never a Doctrine at least you come in
[1:08:18] like it is in these other churches and
[1:08:19] just split them wide open
[1:08:21] why because we tried to stay with the
[1:08:23] truth
[1:08:26] when believing that we needed to
[1:08:28] understand one true and living God I
[1:08:30] tried my best to preach here 40
[1:08:31] something years
[1:08:34] when I believed it we needed to
[1:08:36] understand Daniel 70 weeks even though I
[1:08:38] went contrary to 99 of the ministers the
[1:08:42] message and still contrary to them
[1:08:44] I still stand for it and still believe
[1:08:46] it
[1:08:52] even though we were told to stay out of
[1:08:54] the seals and the things you know by the
[1:08:56] people in their early Parks when they
[1:08:58] came into the message
[1:09:01] I've proceeded to try to study that and
[1:09:03] preach to you what I could see what the
[1:09:05] prophet had to say
[1:09:07] I've tried to hold before you
[1:09:09] an opportunity
[1:09:11] for it to be revealed
[1:09:16] you say are you exalting yourself that's
[1:09:18] no problem nobody got no concern about
[1:09:21] what's going on
[1:09:22] I'm just saying that
[1:09:25] I've tried
[1:09:27] you know what
[1:09:29] every other preacher every other Pulpit
[1:09:31] around the world today I tried right
[1:09:34] they got polygamies
[1:09:38] right but yet they tried
[1:09:45] is that right
[1:09:46] you ever heard a preacher say he didn't
[1:09:48] try
[1:09:52] you ever heard a preacher say he's wrong
[1:09:58] come on
[1:10:00] you ain't been around very long if you
[1:10:03] think you have
[1:10:08] but I thought the Bible said You shall
[1:10:10] know the truth
[1:10:13] well if we haven't had an opportunity to
[1:10:15] hear the truth how can you know where
[1:10:17] it's truth or not
[1:10:22] if we haven't studied the things that
[1:10:24] the prophet brought unto us which I
[1:10:25] thought that was supposed to be what we
[1:10:27] read this morning that the Holy Ghost
[1:10:30] would be loosed
[1:10:33] by the end time message
[1:10:39] see it's the end time message then it's
[1:10:41] preached
[1:10:42] the Holy Ghost is being loose
[1:10:46] how do you get the verchers well I need
[1:10:48] patience well we're just getting to some
[1:10:50] kind of tribulation we'll figure it out
[1:10:51] no no
[1:10:53] reveal word is the only way those
[1:10:55] virtues can come into the individual
[1:11:06] see that way we can stay away from
[1:11:08] organized religion
[1:11:14] and we can buy it and try to believe
[1:11:16] that we're part around the world because
[1:11:18] I believe it I believe around the world
[1:11:20] there is a bride of Christ
[1:11:22] that is striving to understand the end
[1:11:25] time message
[1:11:28] and preachers that are preaching it to
[1:11:30] the best that they understand
[1:11:34] I just want to be a part of that
[1:11:36] organism
[1:11:41] and see that away then we can say
[1:11:43] the truth has set us free
[1:11:46] either hath the son
[1:11:48] at life
[1:11:50] is that scripture
[1:11:58] what about it
[1:12:01] I'm about to comments questions now
[1:12:03] who's got any
[1:12:05] this flick is known him
[1:12:07] okay get a microphone
[1:12:09] can I quote the rest of that scripture
[1:12:10] hang on with it
[1:12:17] silver and little John I believe it is
[1:12:19] and he said he would have some half life
[1:12:23] he who has not the son has not liked me
[1:12:26] so he says these things I've written to
[1:12:29] you
[1:12:30] that you may know that you have eternal
[1:12:32] life
[1:12:34] now we have Sands and butts about it
[1:12:37] only by the revealed work right well you
[1:12:40] know
[1:12:41] we'll have a question
[1:12:48] anybody got a question anybody got a
[1:12:50] comment
[1:12:51] surely after all the dirty sermon 29
[1:12:54] somebody ought to have some okay Susan's
[1:12:57] got one for a friend of hers
[1:13:02] elf
[1:13:03] seriously a friend of mine asked me
[1:13:07] would my pastor rather preach to a
[1:13:10] church full of Sinners or church full of
[1:13:13] saints
[1:13:14] so I'm asking you would you rather a
[1:13:18] bridge to the spiritual centers for
[1:13:20] church full of science
[1:13:22] I answered the question for him but I
[1:13:26] want to know what your answer is
[1:13:28] no I'd rather preach the church full of
[1:13:32] sinners
[1:13:33] the original Church full of science
[1:13:50] you know what after a while we're going
[1:13:52] to be made Saints
[1:13:55] all right
[1:13:57] sin is America was based send me your
[1:14:00] orphans sometimes
[1:14:02] this church was based on them send me
[1:14:04] your messed up people right
[1:14:07] let's see what the word of God can do
[1:14:11] it's always been mine that's right then
[1:14:16] I don't compromise with anybody
[1:14:18] or tell anybody they're okay
[1:14:20] right
[1:14:22] I tell you what the word says
[1:14:27] right
[1:14:31] and it will be a church full of science
[1:14:33] one day who's next
[1:14:36] you got a friend that needs your help
[1:14:38] with a friend
[1:14:43] are these just marriage and divorce
[1:14:45] questions or any questions anything any
[1:14:46] questions
[1:14:48] any questions related into the marriage
[1:14:51] and divorce situation life all right I
[1:14:53] got a page for
[1:14:55] okay
[1:14:56] that battery's only 30 minutes
[1:15:04] we're all human sisters so don't worry
[1:15:06] about determinologies or the thoughts
[1:15:09] okay how does the sold at how does the
[1:15:13] soul die
[1:15:14] but God letting it die
[1:15:17] it dies through justification
[1:15:20] sanctification cleansing it out and that
[1:15:23] lets that old part of you die out of the
[1:15:25] way
[1:15:27] and God takes the word just like he did
[1:15:29] with the disciples it took three and a
[1:15:31] half years for them to get to New Birth
[1:15:35] they were being justified as they walked
[1:15:37] with the Lord forgiven they come in
[1:15:39] Saint John 17 until they become
[1:15:41] sanctified
[1:15:43] but they still did not have the new
[1:15:44] birth until the
[1:15:46] the day of Pentecost
[1:15:48] so that died out
[1:15:50] by
[1:15:53] just want to say it
[1:15:55] the word is what tells you you're lost
[1:15:59] right
[1:16:01] the word is what sanctifies you
[1:16:05] and the Bible says about those disciples
[1:16:08] that in one account it says they took
[1:16:10] the word and held it
[1:16:12] all right
[1:16:15] Jesus was seen of over 500 Brethren
[1:16:18] after the resurrection they called from
[1:16:19] that but only 120 might be Upper Room
[1:16:23] where's the other 380.
[1:16:27] they've even seen him after his
[1:16:29] resurrection the Bible says
[1:16:31] they never took the word in hell that's
[1:16:33] right those disciples had a wonderful
[1:16:35] position
[1:16:36] to be able to walk with him for three
[1:16:39] and a half years
[1:16:40] and question him about what he was just
[1:16:42] saying whereas the others
[1:16:46] they can only take his message or
[1:16:47] whatever they heard
[1:16:51] but it's a revealed word unless that old
[1:16:53] husband died
[1:16:55] washing of the Water by the word
[1:16:58] Paul brother Brandon said what Billy
[1:17:01] Graham had thirty thousand come back now
[1:17:03] Thirty Paul have Thirty come back and
[1:17:04] have one he said or whatever how many
[1:17:06] would say he said Paul took his convert
[1:17:09] home
[1:17:11] to the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:15] see we think well no I just got the Holy
[1:17:17] Ghost to walk up and believe that's a
[1:17:18] good old Baptist though
[1:17:22] and I hope it's right
[1:17:25] none for everybody
[1:17:27] okay number two
[1:17:30] how do you send from the cell
[1:17:33] how do you send from the soul now you're
[1:17:35] talking about you
[1:17:38] you're talking about before a Christian
[1:17:39] or after Christian
[1:17:41] okay okay all right we'll take it before
[1:17:44] because the nature of your soul is the
[1:17:46] devil
[1:17:47] so that's where you Sin from
[1:17:50] right that's where your unbelief is at
[1:17:52] is in your soul
[1:17:55] but see then once you're born again you
[1:17:58] cannot Sin from that Soul because John
[1:18:00] says the little John says seeds
[1:18:01] remaineth in you and you cannot sin but
[1:18:04] yet in this body and spirit that we are
[1:18:06] Realm
[1:18:08] we can still do wrong
[1:18:10] but it's not in the soul
[1:18:13] there is no sin in the soul of a
[1:18:15] born-again Christian
[1:18:18] okay
[1:18:21] this is the last one okay did did
[1:18:24] brother Brandon
[1:18:26] he did did he see us beyond the curtain
[1:18:29] of timing
[1:18:31] or we when he went beyond the quickness
[1:18:33] time
[1:18:34] I like to think so
[1:18:36] but I couldn't say I can only say what
[1:18:38] he said
[1:18:40] he made your statement one time he said
[1:18:42] I saw you there all right but remember
[1:18:44] he's been inhaled and been in heaven
[1:18:49] I mean I'm just a honest you ask the
[1:18:52] question I'm just honest to answer the I
[1:18:55] believe he did see the end time bride
[1:19:01] those that had already gone
[1:19:03] unnecessarily
[1:19:07] it could be you and I that he saw
[1:19:10] because when you get into the soul the
[1:19:12] theophany the new birth
[1:19:13] you're getting into very Heavenly Realms
[1:19:16] and atmospheres
[1:19:19] he saw his first wife there
[1:19:26] in a dream or Vision or something later
[1:19:28] he saw a judgment coming that media and
[1:19:31] hope both were with him one of them was
[1:19:32] alive the other ones passed on
[1:19:34] so you're dealing in religious I mean in
[1:19:36] very high spiritual realms I really
[1:19:38] can't answer that
[1:19:40] I just say I hope so
[1:19:43] okay all right behind you just turn it
[1:19:45] back
[1:19:48] with the last one
[1:19:51] I spoke with the last one whether he saw
[1:19:54] us there I'd be considerate the way when
[1:19:57] he went beyond the curtain of time he
[1:20:00] saw his body laying on the bed
[1:20:02] I don't know what kind of order you hit
[1:20:04] it but he was on the other side now how
[1:20:07] does a soul die
[1:20:09] I I liked how you towards the end of the
[1:20:13] service today
[1:20:14] you said you see one thing say one thing
[1:20:17] is revealed to you and you won't believe
[1:20:19] like say
[1:20:21] baptism in Jesus name when you that's
[1:20:24] revealed to you you will not see father
[1:20:26] son Holy Ghost again that kind of dies
[1:20:29] dies and I think the soul guys by being
[1:20:34] born again all the time you just have to
[1:20:36] keep the word has to be revealed to you
[1:20:39] you can't put a full stop you have to
[1:20:40] keep going
[1:20:42] so just continue dying and so what is
[1:20:44] revealed to you and maybe one day we'll
[1:20:47] reach affection somewhere
[1:20:50] changes Maybe
[1:20:51] you see we are the scripture says he
[1:20:53] ain't born again
[1:20:54] that's the statue of perfect man you
[1:20:56] burst into this verse into this it's the
[1:20:58] prophet's word all right in doing it
[1:21:01] see then the new birth there's one New
[1:21:02] Birth
[1:21:04] but there's many feelings of the holy
[1:21:06] spirit that were filled in the book of
[1:21:07] Acts
[1:21:08] many times through many feelings but
[1:21:10] there was one New Birth
[1:21:11] but then in the growth development
[1:21:14] there's many
[1:21:15] you know you're birthed into this you're
[1:21:17] birthed into this you burnt into this
[1:21:19] you're not getting all new births you're
[1:21:22] just being birthings are coming forth
[1:21:23] into so you're coming forth into another
[1:21:26] stage of development you know and see
[1:21:29] once that soul is eternal
[1:21:31] Satan can't dwell there
[1:21:34] it's you and God
[1:21:36] it's not you and the devil and God
[1:21:39] it's you and God together the prophet
[1:21:42] said it's persons
[1:21:43] all right so then there's no way Satan
[1:21:46] can get back into that soul
[1:21:48] so then if a Christian does wrong it's
[1:21:50] body and spirit that's right that's
[1:21:52] sensible
[1:21:53] body and spirit does wrong
[1:21:56] run around them do you sin he said every
[1:21:58] day
[1:21:59] now did Brother Branham have the big
[1:22:00] letter word sin that meant unbelief
[1:22:08] I don't think so
[1:22:10] I think he's believing
[1:22:12] but see there is a word of sin that is
[1:22:14] not to say unbelief it is a word of sin
[1:22:18] has to be as we gave it this morning
[1:22:20] brother Brown had it on there he said
[1:22:22] talk about your sins
[1:22:24] you know in fact and then he said
[1:22:26] you know you're bound by your Creed
[1:22:28] sometimes
[1:22:31] the Creeds we have is the worst sin we
[1:22:33] could ever have
[1:22:37] believing there is no God
[1:22:41] that's just believing it
[1:22:43] but to try to straighten out that God
[1:22:47] are to
[1:22:49] bring him down to human things
[1:22:52] and get into a lot of unbelief
[1:22:56] anybody else
[1:22:59] sister Trudy
[1:23:03] thinking on base the questions on the
[1:23:07] soul dying
[1:23:09] I'm taught what I would they ask like to
[1:23:12] ask a question about is the death of the
[1:23:14] soul that second death do you have you
[1:23:16] ever thought about that
[1:23:18] how that would happen how it will happen
[1:23:20] then it's the second death yes
[1:23:22] God will have to let it be annihilated
[1:23:26] because that is the difference that's
[1:23:28] what the scripture says you know the
[1:23:30] second death
[1:23:31] and he says it's the death of the Soul
[1:23:33] all right just because a sinner dies
[1:23:35] doesn't mean his soul is destroyed it's
[1:23:37] no more than you he has a place to go to
[1:23:39] that's right he has a body to live in
[1:23:42] you know when the prophet will call it a
[1:23:44] theophany
[1:23:45] because it's a body a position a place
[1:23:48] to go to remain until the Judgment day
[1:23:50] will come but then death and hell is
[1:23:52] both cast into the Lake of Fire the
[1:23:54] Bible says that is the second death
[1:23:57] so when you get death and hell and
[1:23:59] everything combined together throw it
[1:24:01] into a lake of fire
[1:24:03] to be burned up completely
[1:24:06] and it's all annihilated
[1:24:10] that is the death of the soul of that
[1:24:12] individual because only God can kill a
[1:24:14] soul the Bible says don't worry about
[1:24:15] you that can destroy the flesh but to
[1:24:17] worry about he that can destroy the body
[1:24:19] and spirit right soul and spiritually
[1:24:21] but you know both of them in hell
[1:24:25] because that's
[1:24:28] we don't believe in eternal hell
[1:24:30] you'd have to have eternal life to live
[1:24:32] there we believe hell then we'll finally
[1:24:35] be a knowledge and death and Hell one
[1:24:37] day will be cashed into the Lake of Fire
[1:24:38] and that person as the soul
[1:24:42] will be totally annihilated
[1:24:45] because that would have to be spiritual
[1:24:46] then because no fire can burn up the
[1:24:50] soul of an individual right
[1:24:53] so it would have to be a spiritual
[1:24:55] condition
[1:24:57] that God would have to finally
[1:24:58] annihilate that
[1:25:04] dying in the flesh
[1:25:07] let me go back over there now I said you
[1:25:09] kind of wonder whether that would feel
[1:25:11] dying
[1:25:13] and the soul is that
[1:25:18] it's kind of a morbid thought
[1:25:22] it's a dining place
[1:25:25] would be horrible for a sinner
[1:25:28] but what about you know that's why I
[1:25:30] love the way brother random would
[1:25:31] explain things
[1:25:33] he said hell's not burning
[1:25:37] he said a burning hell would be a
[1:25:39] pleasure
[1:25:40] how about that
[1:25:43] he said there's an endless falling
[1:25:47] because you see hell has no Foundation
[1:25:48] to it
[1:25:50] would be an endless falling
[1:25:54] remember the first sermon he preached
[1:25:56] there was no mama in hell
[1:25:58] there was no Daddy in hell
[1:26:00] there was no God in hell
[1:26:03] you know that I'd like to hear that
[1:26:04] sermon
[1:26:06] because he had a lot of Truth
[1:26:10] to be absent from the body is to be
[1:26:13] present with the Lord right that
[1:26:14] scripture
[1:26:16] but what about a sinner
[1:26:18] he's absent from the body he can't be
[1:26:20] present with the Lord
[1:26:23] be a horrible time
[1:26:26] it wouldn't be nobody there that could
[1:26:28] take your place
[1:26:32] anything else
[1:26:33] anybody up
[1:26:39] anybody else got a comment or call her
[1:26:42] I got one more question
[1:26:44] one more question okay
[1:26:51] we can always depend on
[1:26:53] the freedom without questions
[1:26:56] um
[1:26:57] you said several times that we
[1:27:00] can accept God but then
[1:27:07] that is true Prophet said you say you
[1:27:10] saw God he said the Bible says and it
[1:27:12] does it says no man saw God
[1:27:14] all right now
[1:27:16] when the prophet is expressing that he
[1:27:18] does not mean I don't think that you
[1:27:20] didn't try in some way to find God
[1:27:24] when it says no man sought God it
[1:27:26] doesn't mean you didn't pray cry seek
[1:27:29] God and do those things because the
[1:27:31] Bible says the goodness of God
[1:27:34] is what leadeth you to repentance
[1:27:36] so then way we done we went through life
[1:27:40] and seeking God
[1:27:43] that wasn't wrong it wasn't wrong to
[1:27:45] seek God that's the human part
[1:27:49] so it's not meaning then I don't think
[1:27:51] he's expressing that that we never
[1:27:54] sought God right we come in contact he
[1:27:58] said with a god
[1:28:00] and he said once doing that you'll never
[1:28:02] be the same
[1:28:04] why
[1:28:06] because you've been in the presence of
[1:28:08] an eternal being
[1:28:10] you'll never be the same
[1:28:11] you'll never stop seeking him
[1:28:14] all right now when it says that
[1:28:18] you must accept him
[1:28:20] because God the prophet says will not
[1:28:23] override your free moral agency he will
[1:28:25] not save you when you do not want to be
[1:28:27] saved
[1:28:29] so you accept him
[1:28:33] as your personal savior
[1:28:36] you see then he must accept you
[1:28:39] and that's what I think is wrong with
[1:28:41] the basics of the world today a lot of
[1:28:44] people comes to the Altar and they
[1:28:46] accept Jesus Christ as their Savior and
[1:28:48] themselves
[1:28:51] you see God knows what they're going to
[1:28:54] do
[1:28:55] he knows whether they're going to
[1:28:57] continue on
[1:28:59] so maybe a hundreds in the order maybe
[1:29:02] one gets truly saved
[1:29:04] well you can really say that that was
[1:29:06] the only one that God accepted
[1:29:08] right right
[1:29:10] because he got saved that's right so you
[1:29:13] can accept God every day your life will
[1:29:15] still be lost
[1:29:17] but if he accepts you
[1:29:21] see then that doesn't do away it places
[1:29:23] all of it because he can't override you
[1:29:25] free more agency right
[1:29:28] he can only is the man in prison he can
[1:29:30] only offer to pardon
[1:29:36] and when he offers you the pardon if you
[1:29:37] don't accept it
[1:29:39] it won't work
[1:29:41] but when you accept that pardon
[1:29:44] remember it's not you walking out of the
[1:29:46] jail
[1:29:48] that's right that pardon is what's going
[1:29:50] to take you out right right
[1:29:52] that's when he accepted you
[1:29:55] because if not he's going to leave you
[1:29:57] sitting in jail with a paperwork game
[1:29:59] I mean that's just the carnal comparison
[1:30:03] so then when it says no man sought God
[1:30:06] at any time that doesn't do away with
[1:30:08] your fasting and crying and praying for
[1:30:10] God to save you
[1:30:13] like I've always said about Abraham why
[1:30:15] did God choose Abraham
[1:30:17] what was any good about him what was
[1:30:19] anything right
[1:30:21] God could see the future of Abraham
[1:30:26] and he knew Abraham would believe him
[1:30:32] he could see your future see he knows
[1:30:35] whether you're honest or not
[1:30:37] if you're not honest with him
[1:30:39] you can just keep accepting all you want
[1:30:41] to but he don't have to accept you
[1:30:42] because he knows
[1:30:45] that's not God choosing one over the
[1:30:48] other that's the point of straight
[1:30:50] through
[1:30:51] that he knows whether or not we will
[1:30:53] accept him correctly he knows whether or
[1:30:56] not that accepting him is right or are
[1:30:58] we just accepting him getting out of go
[1:31:00] to you know to get out of going to hell
[1:31:02] are we just accepting him because of the
[1:31:04] the young people in the church accepted
[1:31:07] him
[1:31:08] are we just accepting him because and
[1:31:11] that's why brother random was against it
[1:31:12] of all their calls right but yet he gave
[1:31:15] them till he died
[1:31:17] but what was the form of altar call he
[1:31:19] was against
[1:31:21] coming to the altar when he called him
[1:31:23] to the altar no he said it's going out
[1:31:26] there
[1:31:27] and talking to those people
[1:31:30] and trying to get them to come to God
[1:31:33] I can say personally I witnessed that
[1:31:36] right
[1:31:37] my sister
[1:31:40] would come and talk to me in the church
[1:31:42] when all the call was there that was the
[1:31:44] greatest hinders I had
[1:31:48] because
[1:31:51] I didn't like her ways
[1:31:54] and I didn't want what she had
[1:31:58] right
[1:32:01] I don't desire for that I knew more
[1:32:03] about God than she did
[1:32:05] and I don't mean that wrong
[1:32:09] but see she was a cause of me not coming
[1:32:12] a lot of times
[1:32:14] he said but I've been letting
[1:32:16] like her talk to you now Lord led me to
[1:32:19] there's a lot of difference in leading
[1:32:21] in a good thought a good thought is we
[1:32:23] need to save everybody right let's go
[1:32:26] talk to them you need to come to the
[1:32:27] altar because your mama is going to be
[1:32:29] in heaven don't you want to be in heaven
[1:32:31] with your mama
[1:32:35] is that right away you know what the
[1:32:38] prophet had to say
[1:32:40] now this is his words I'll find it maybe
[1:32:42] paragraph paraphrase it but he said
[1:32:44] you'll make him a two-fold child of hell
[1:32:46] he said cause it to be harder to get
[1:32:48] them to alter the next time
[1:32:52] so I've told you don't scare your kids
[1:32:56] don't tell your kids go God's mad at you
[1:33:01] the kid's gonna look around and see
[1:33:05] he's been mad at you a long time
[1:33:10] right
[1:33:13] don't do it but for you to tell you not
[1:33:16] to seek God that would be the wrong
[1:33:18] thing
[1:33:19] I got in trouble in that church that
[1:33:21] time when I encouraged people to seek
[1:33:22] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[1:33:24] preacher said I had them based on the
[1:33:25] word I said I apologize for teaching
[1:33:28] anything in your church you don't agree
[1:33:29] with but I will never apologize
[1:33:32] for the basins of trying to get people
[1:33:33] to seek God
[1:33:36] so it's not when the prophet would say
[1:33:37] you didn't see God God sought you what
[1:33:40] do you think he was he doing
[1:33:44] he was his goodness was leading you to
[1:33:46] the altar
[1:33:50] but then if you don't accept it
[1:33:55] everything's off
[1:33:58] well that makes a conditional Covenant
[1:34:01] no it don't because a covenant's no good
[1:34:03] until you accept it
[1:34:06] come on come on it's no good until you
[1:34:08] accept the contract
[1:34:10] so it doesn't and all uh unconditional
[1:34:13] Covenant are you going to say an
[1:34:14] unconditional Covenant is he going to
[1:34:16] say who he wants to
[1:34:17] and the rest of me is going to send them
[1:34:19] to hell no
[1:34:21] will work
[1:34:23] unconditional Covenant
[1:34:25] is when he offers it to you
[1:34:28] unconditionally all you got to do is
[1:34:31] accept it right that's right
[1:34:35] that's it and you accept it
[1:34:39] and see we want it to be screaming
[1:34:41] hollering crying sneaking in tongue
[1:34:43] shouting and off but you remember the
[1:34:44] man
[1:34:46] it looked in his spot looked at her
[1:34:48] track one day and said where will you
[1:34:50] spend eternity
[1:34:51] he put the track in his pocket and he
[1:34:53] started searching for God
[1:34:55] he went everywhere went to all the
[1:34:56] Pentecostals and everything else
[1:34:59] going to brother Randleman
[1:35:01] another one said you remember when you
[1:35:03] put that in your pocket
[1:35:05] he said you mean I was saved all the
[1:35:07] time
[1:35:10] he evidently was
[1:35:13] a lot of difference all right sister
[1:35:15] Gail all right
[1:35:23] were you asking what would be your
[1:35:26] evidence that God had accepted you you
[1:35:29] got seven people along the floor and
[1:35:31] they've all accepted the Lord and you
[1:35:33] said but the Lord only accepted one what
[1:35:36] was that person's evidence that he had
[1:35:38] been accepted but the others had not
[1:35:40] been
[1:35:41] is would it be the life lived afterwards
[1:35:43] that's the only evidence you have yeah
[1:35:47] what you were asking well not really
[1:35:49] everything right now I mean when he was
[1:35:51] ministering several times he said you
[1:35:54] can accept God but brother random said
[1:35:55] he has to accept you
[1:35:59] I would you know I mean so you were
[1:36:01] saying that the other people down there
[1:36:04] even though they thought that they had
[1:36:06] accepted Christ and he hadn't accepted
[1:36:08] them that they were not sincere
[1:36:11] it would not continue on with the doing
[1:36:13] see that's scriptural okay they got it
[1:36:15] on the board okay good and then just by
[1:36:19] accepting it won't
[1:36:20] only do God's got to vindicate back that
[1:36:24] he has accepted you that's the thing you
[1:36:26] can accept him and then if he accepts
[1:36:29] you stay right there until he does
[1:36:31] except you
[1:36:33] and then when he does he seals you into
[1:36:35] the kingdom by the baptism of the Holy
[1:36:37] Spirit What's the title of the message
[1:36:41] God's provided way priests in 1953 1201
[1:36:45] would be paragraph E9
[1:36:49] I like them brothers back there that way
[1:36:51] ahead of me a long time
[1:36:53] I appreciate it I can make statements
[1:36:57] make him pull them up
[1:36:58] but see this God knows
[1:37:00] whether or not your sins here
[1:37:04] and I said you come to the altar because
[1:37:05] of somebody
[1:37:07] begging you to come somebody pleading
[1:37:09] you to come
[1:37:13] we'll see that won't work
[1:37:17] it's when God speaks to your heart
[1:37:21] and you come and you accept him and if
[1:37:23] he don't do if he don't let you know
[1:37:25] right then don't quit
[1:37:27] two years after coming in this message
[1:37:30] before I receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:37:32] Ghost
[1:37:34] and I had him to pray for me everywhere
[1:37:36] in the world
[1:37:37] everywhere I went I had him to pray for
[1:37:39] me
[1:37:41] and you see one day I had to realize he
[1:37:43] had accepted me
[1:37:46] you say well what it was a knowledge
[1:37:50] now we're going back to where we was
[1:37:51] talking about a while ago what is the
[1:37:52] new birth
[1:37:54] of Revelation
[1:37:57] seek God until you get an answer I've
[1:38:00] told you what 8 432 times I guess
[1:38:05] I'd rather go through life seeking God
[1:38:07] get it to end and find out
[1:38:10] that I had it all alone
[1:38:13] than to not seek him at all and go to
[1:38:15] the end of it and find out I don't have
[1:38:16] it
[1:38:18] no but we're we're not supposed to if I
[1:38:21] deny that's trinitarian drive if I deny
[1:38:23] the father I deny the son you ever talk
[1:38:25] to trinitarian
[1:38:27] about salvation
[1:38:28] you talked to him about one God and
[1:38:30] that's what he'll tell you
[1:38:32] if I deny the father I deny the son well
[1:38:35] we believe they're all one
[1:38:40] anymore
[1:38:42] anybody else
[1:38:45] sister okay
[1:38:53] no they asked me the other day and I
[1:38:56] didn't know how to answer it he said if
[1:38:59] Jesus Is God if Jesus Is God then why
[1:39:03] did he say don't pray to me pray to my
[1:39:06] father
[1:39:08] and I wanted to sure I tried to answer
[1:39:11] it but I think I confused you more than
[1:39:14] because you're simply say in this places
[1:39:16] you're looking at is not what you think
[1:39:18] it is it's only a body for God to
[1:39:20] inhabit it is not God
[1:39:22] it is the body for God to inhabit then
[1:39:26] one day that body was made Eternal and
[1:39:28] that's fine because it went back to
[1:39:29] being
[1:39:31] and see he was telling the ride
[1:39:34] and he said when he said it's my father
[1:39:36] in it
[1:39:37] is doing it
[1:39:38] that's true
[1:39:40] you've got to divide between the Flesh
[1:39:42] and the Sun the Flesh and the father
[1:39:50] when the Son and the father thing and
[1:39:53] and I didn't really know how to
[1:39:55] elaborate on it and without confusing
[1:39:58] him more than he was already confused
[1:40:00] and it was something that that he's been
[1:40:02] confused about for years and he wanted
[1:40:04] to kind of Bible Study last night asking
[1:40:07] and he had a family member that I had to
[1:40:09] go to the hospital so he couldn't make
[1:40:10] it so
[1:40:12] what else
[1:40:17] because I believe that Jesus was
[1:40:19] almighty God Amen amen but that body out
[1:40:22] there was a creation it had a beginning
[1:40:24] and had to be made eternal
[1:40:26] that's why he would say I and my father
[1:40:29] are one
[1:40:32] see I and my father are one because the
[1:40:35] same genes it was in my father is in me
[1:40:38] that's just natural carnal but it's true
[1:40:40] me
[1:40:42] and that's when he was standing there he
[1:40:43] said if you've seen me you've seen the
[1:40:45] father why because the father was
[1:40:47] dwelling inside that flesh
[1:40:49] not meaning if you've seen this
[1:40:52] because as I said 500 seen him raised
[1:40:55] but it didn't do 380 of them any good
[1:41:00] because he didn't know him I don't think
[1:41:02] the best answer he could get is to come
[1:41:04] to church and hear it right I mean
[1:41:06] regularly enough that he's going to be
[1:41:09] comfortable with and he's got the more
[1:41:11] he comes and the more he hears he's
[1:41:13] going to learn like we all have get in
[1:41:16] church a book jump start on page one
[1:41:18] I'll do that it's our first hundred
[1:41:20] pages
[1:41:23] serpent seat and all kind of thing
[1:41:25] that's the best book to me to introduce
[1:41:27] the message
[1:41:28] is the church age book anybody else
[1:41:30] before we go
[1:41:31] sister Trudy wait
[1:41:35] now y'all speak up a little bit in other
[1:41:37] words speak to me like he's going to
[1:41:38] speak to your husband at home when he's
[1:41:40] in the bedroom and you're in the kitchen
[1:41:43] my wife knows how to get me in a hurry
[1:41:44] she ought to Sam y'all
[1:41:49] go ahead
[1:41:51] it's something that I've always been
[1:41:54] having a problem with his is
[1:41:57] into attached free this situation
[1:42:01] I feel and I hope I'm right in it now
[1:42:04] to know that God accepts you is when you
[1:42:09] realize your true desire is to hear more
[1:42:13] there's a true interest to get to hear
[1:42:16] more word
[1:42:18] you want to keep learning you want to do
[1:42:21] it and that's the only thing I can base
[1:42:23] it on because I never get any
[1:42:27] so I'm hoping that he's accepted me
[1:42:29] because I enjoy being here I am hearing
[1:42:32] what I hear you I'd rather have it based
[1:42:36] upon what he said in the word than any
[1:42:39] manifestation as it could ever be
[1:42:40] thought of
[1:42:42] he says in years if you believe
[1:42:49] he that believeth not believes and just
[1:42:51] stops he didn't believeth in his
[1:42:53] baptized shall be saved
[1:42:55] Keep On Believing
[1:42:57] two years
[1:42:59] I saw God
[1:43:01] that's right after coming in the message
[1:43:04] a deacon at 23 years of age
[1:43:08] but yet I realized I was lost I didn't
[1:43:11] have I didn't think I was lost to be a
[1:43:13] hell-bound
[1:43:15] uh
[1:43:16] blasphemer I didn't believe that
[1:43:19] but I didn't believe I was born again
[1:43:21] because when Road around started talking
[1:43:23] about God being a person
[1:43:25] you better listen to what he's saying
[1:43:28] God is not a spirit
[1:43:32] that's what we think
[1:43:36] he's a person
[1:43:37] he's real
[1:43:42] anybody else before we go
[1:43:46] yeah
[1:43:48] we got to go into the communion I forgot
[1:43:50] to forget that I
[1:43:52] know other places I go I just swear off
[1:43:55] talking the Bible a lot of times but I
[1:43:58] found out it does me more good to do
[1:44:00] that
[1:44:02] than anything else you need to you need
[1:44:04] to talk to people that don't understand
[1:44:08] what you're talking about
[1:44:10] and I think when you do that you'll come
[1:44:12] to a greater understanding of what
[1:44:14] you're talking about well we talked
[1:44:17] about the 380 it didn't go to the upper
[1:44:20] room
[1:44:21] and of course I'm not supposed to think
[1:44:23] but my thought on them they was around
[1:44:25] for the fishes and the lows
[1:44:29] you know
[1:44:31] and then the 120
[1:44:34] it went to the upper room when he come
[1:44:36] back down
[1:44:38] they asked Peter you know they said they
[1:44:40] were pricked in their heart
[1:44:43] and uh
[1:44:45] I believe uh I I believe this I because
[1:44:49] it happened to me
[1:44:51] if you're not pricked in your heart
[1:44:54] it ain't gonna work it ain't gonna
[1:44:56] happen
[1:44:56] right you're gonna be efficient in those
[1:44:58] but and you say well Lord how do I know
[1:45:02] I've been pricked in my heart
[1:45:04] were you just asking
[1:45:06] ask him to take you to that place
[1:45:09] yeah you're here today it's pretty good
[1:45:12] evidence that sometime or another that
[1:45:14] you've been breaking your heart right
[1:45:16] and uh if you've been pricking your
[1:45:20] heart
[1:45:21] and you've done what he told you to do
[1:45:25] uh he's he's obligated to fulfill
[1:45:29] what he promised to do in your life oh
[1:45:33] we need to find somebody else to follow
[1:45:34] right right
[1:45:37] um will that help anybody about it
[1:45:39] that's what I can hear the questions of
[1:45:42] people that people have
[1:45:45] and my desire for you
[1:45:47] is to have eternal life exactly you know
[1:45:51] my song well God bless you all right
[1:45:54] then a second before we get ready to go
[1:45:56] what is prepped in your heart
[1:46:00] you're walking up and you look at
[1:46:02] something and you realize
[1:46:03] I'm lost
[1:46:08] that's just a realization
[1:46:11] you've made a contact with an eternal
[1:46:13] being
[1:46:16] and then he can just work on that heart
[1:46:20] brother said if you can get that soul to
[1:46:22] agree with him souls in prison he said
[1:46:25] that nature will die
[1:46:28] if you just get him stand still long
[1:46:30] enough
[1:46:32] and everybody wants to shout and scream
[1:46:33] and Gloria Hallelujah
[1:46:35] I believe the new birth is the birth of
[1:46:37] the word I don't believe there's any
[1:46:39] person ever been born again in the Bible
[1:46:41] that didn't hear the word
[1:46:45] Now give me the Bible
[1:46:47] no no way because you got to hear first
[1:46:49] Faith cometh by hearing hearing by the
[1:46:52] word and to be a message declared before
[1:46:55] you could be saved
[1:46:56] an opportunity had to be made on the day
[1:46:58] of Pentecost before
[1:47:01] they could be saved they had three and a
[1:47:03] half years of hearing the word
[1:47:06] took one Split Second
[1:47:10] you said when were they pricked in their
[1:47:12] heart maybe many times
[1:47:14] but maybe one of them was one thing
[1:47:16] that he took a prophet to express that
[1:47:18] right
[1:47:19] all right
[1:47:20] he said one of them said let's get up
[1:47:22] and go out we got it
[1:47:26] somebody said we don't have it
[1:47:30] my Point's always been one time
[1:47:32] you're sitting there you're scared to
[1:47:35] death that they're going to break in the
[1:47:37] door and kill you any minute it was not
[1:47:39] not the problem because they were for
[1:47:40] fear they were pulled out in Upper Room
[1:47:42] all right
[1:47:43] and a man get up and tell me said let's
[1:47:46] go we got it
[1:47:47] I'm going to look at him and say you go
[1:47:49] first
[1:47:54] it's these people you know that want all
[1:47:55] of you to line up and take a bomb and go
[1:47:58] get killed give it to him and let him go
[1:48:00] first
[1:48:02] oh it ain't gonna be that
[1:48:04] you see somebody said
[1:48:07] we don't have it
[1:48:08] right because they're still scared to
[1:48:10] death
[1:48:12] when that Holy Ghost fail
[1:48:15] every one of them in there went outside
[1:48:19] because they had something in their
[1:48:20] heart amen
[1:48:23] let's stand together we get to talk and
[1:48:25] get forget about the communion
[1:48:28] the brothers will get everything ready
[1:48:34] we go into First Corinthians 11 chapter
[1:48:37] 23 for I have received of the Lord that
[1:48:39] which also undelivered unto you that the
[1:48:41] Lord Jesus the same night
[1:48:43] in which he was betrayed took bread and
[1:48:45] when he had given thanks you break it
[1:48:47] and said take eat this is my body which
[1:48:49] is broken for you this doing remembrance
[1:48:51] of me after the same manner also we took
[1:48:54] the cup when he had stopped saying this
[1:48:56] cup is the New Testament in my blood
[1:48:57] this new year as often as you drink it
[1:49:00] in remembrance of me for as often as you
[1:49:02] eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:49:06] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:49:09] shoot the Lord's death till he come
[1:49:11] whosoever of course we're for whosoever
[1:49:15] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:49:17] of the Lord unworthy shall be guilty of
[1:49:19] the body and
[1:49:21] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:49:23] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:49:25] that bread and drink of that cup or eat
[1:49:26] it eateth and drinketh unworthily eatest
[1:49:28] and drink a damnation to himself not
[1:49:30] Discerning the Lord's body
[1:49:32] for this caused many are weak and sickly
[1:49:35] among you and many sleep for we would
[1:49:38] judge ourselves we should not be judged
[1:49:40] I love this but when we are judged but
[1:49:43] it's not Cast Away
[1:49:44] we're even chastened of the Lord
[1:49:47] why that we should not be condemned with
[1:49:49] the world we're for my brethren when you
[1:49:51] come together to eat Terry one for
[1:49:53] another and if any man hunger let him
[1:49:55] eat at home that you come not together
[1:49:57] into condemnation the rest was set in
[1:49:59] order when I come
[1:50:02] the Bible says they took time and They
[1:50:04] Carried for a moment let's just take a
[1:50:05] few moments and just pray one for
[1:50:07] another silently before the Lord
[1:50:23] father we just thank you for the day
[1:50:24] that we've had in the time here we ask
[1:50:26] you now as we continue on with the
[1:50:28] service that you'd be with each and
[1:50:29] every one of us forgive our sins and
[1:50:31] lead us by thy Grace goddess in Jesus
[1:50:34] name
[1:50:38] the Bible said he took bread and blessed
[1:50:40] it
[1:50:41] father we thank you for this bread has
[1:50:43] been made for this purpose today now we
[1:50:45] come to the time of partaking
[1:50:47] it was well and good for it to be made
[1:50:49] in all from an honest heart to make it
[1:50:51] but yet Lord if we don't partake of it
[1:50:53] then we don't have any part to do with
[1:50:56] it so now let us each one in our own
[1:50:58] self examine ourselves
[1:51:00] and let us be like the clay that would
[1:51:02] be the port of Potter's hands that we
[1:51:04] may be molded into what you would want
[1:51:06] us to be forgive our sins make us worthy
[1:51:09] to be able to take this bread and Lord
[1:51:11] sanctify the bread we know that it is
[1:51:13] not your body but it is representation
[1:51:16] of that so we ask you to just have your
[1:51:18] way now in Jesus name
[1:51:29] thank you
[1:51:41] they're bringing up these new ones to
[1:51:45] make bread
[1:51:47] and break it and we even had to
[1:51:49] the ministers to come forth and
[1:51:52] serve the communion to you and had the
[1:51:54] deacons to come and do their part
[1:51:56] because
[1:51:57] that was what we're supposed to do and
[1:52:00] you know because we want everybody ready
[1:52:02] against the day because we don't know
[1:52:04] what the day will bring but we know who
[1:52:06] holds the day
[1:52:07] and we just rest in that
[1:52:10] but see we've had a good time I've
[1:52:11] enjoyed letting these brothers you know
[1:52:13] serve the communion
[1:52:15] because I believe that's what the
[1:52:17] purpose and the things is directed for
[1:52:19] each one to be set aside to do you know
[1:52:22] in our doings and in that way we're
[1:52:24] we're not just one person
[1:52:26] we are one body in Christ
[1:52:33] father we thank you for this wine it's
[1:52:34] gone through the time of process of
[1:52:37] aging and gets better each day
[1:52:39] we know that it represents thy blood
[1:52:41] that was shed for each one of us we ask
[1:52:43] you now to sanctify the wine enter
[1:52:45] partakers that we may be all together as
[1:52:47] one in you in Jesus name
[1:52:56] come morning
[1:52:59] oh
[1:53:01] by the river
[1:53:04] I'll rest thee
[1:53:07] the evergreen tree
