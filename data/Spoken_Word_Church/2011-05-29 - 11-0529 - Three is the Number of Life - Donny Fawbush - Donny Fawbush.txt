that kind of hit me yall I don't know how long it be I don't believe will be that long but uh something has been really burning my heart um the last couple of weeks on some things that uh has has come about that we U I don't know how how your Journeys has been but they all we all have to be the same and it has to be around the Lord and one of the first scriptures that really come to my heart that Brother D was preaching about I don't know probably four or five years ago maybe six that Romans 8:11 and he spoke of it and U I really didn't understand a lot then and I still don't still uh always looking for the Lord to come on the scene and going hey it's like this you know hit you on the back of the head and say this is the way it really is I don't know how he does y'all but that's the way does me and uh I want to speak on some things that brother brandham brought about U get back to Romans 8 right quick but um let me get into this one thing that uh brother Bram was talking about uh where's that in the Hebrews book here we go I was going to read this last but I'm going to go ahead and read it first cuz I really like the title the way it works it says U Hebrews book chapter 4 Jeffersonville Indiana Sunday 57091 evening service 151 187 now watch that was the third rest he gave the first God received it from his work the second Israel received it in the law and the Third Church received it as a part of God three is the number of Life how many knows that every time you see three it's life notice when God created the Earth on the third day was life how many knows that the third day there came life on the third day of creation the Trinity the father was was above the people in a pillar of fire the son was a man who talked to uh people and got them ready the Holy Ghost was a third step which was the Holy Ghost God in the people life Father and Son the rest of God the rest of Israel and the rest of the church the Sabbath keeping I really like that because uh not to play with numbers or say that anyone numb is better than another numbers that this this point here he makes with the number three and he says that uh God perfects in threes and he does cuz about everything we run into uh in the scripture I could sit here and it's like uh brother Joe on on his what he does on the light I mean it's that's just part of of his demonstration to us of revealing himself to us uh who we are I want to go back to uh right now Romans 8 and uh Romans 8:11 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you uh there was a point that in in past just while back I'm not going to bring it up but within this context that uh what I witnessed the last couple of weeks about that same scripture God gave me a furtherment of it and also a furtherment of by his stripes were healed and I've seen that to me God was sitting there and he he revealed it to me me as something was happening in my life was very dear and close to me a passing of my dad that I could sit there and watch and I mean it was I'm sorry folks I was sitting there and I watched it and I seen it and the Lord just come right out and he said this is it this is uh you know it's it's not time right and so he's he's got to pass on over he won't suffer no more and and here's your scripture let me bring it back to you if the spirit is in us that raised up Christ Jesus Christ Lord and Savior our creator and all of us we have to look and see and know that hey if you ain't got it you better be real busy trying to figure out how to get it because without the new birth and that's the only way that can come to you we're just going to be sitting around and be left behind I ain't going to be left behind Lord willing wasz I do anything I could to be sure that I got that and everything God giv me is just wonderful but I noticed that in my times past things ain't as like they used to be it's longer and longer that he comes and and uh and and does these things like that to me and quickens things to me but anyway as I sitting there and you see this uh that's passing and and it's you know you know what's happening the body's going in One Direction the spirit and the soul is the spirit's done gone out the life is gone out and you sit there and you look and you go well well there's got to be more than this than that I mean a Christian don't just die they lay there asleep their body just literally goes to sleep and they they move on and uh he as I was sitting there God said now there's more to this than that you can see now his healing you know that I've taught you and I've told you that he's already over there and he's having he's having fun right now about a 20-year-old and he's he's over there with Mama he's over I can see him over talking to brother brandom hey what did you think when this big old guy come down and I mean I heard what you said but what did you really think or or who knows you know he I'm sure with him he was over there just talking to a lot of people cuz I was over there picking up his books and listen he had four or five books on Christ mystery God reveal uh Jesus Christ same day yesterday and and forever and he' went back to them and he just wrote all this stuff in them each one of them and there were like every one of them some of them he repeated it but other he went back and and it's just like you're sitting there reading all this and you see all this take place and you go okay there's got to be more Romans 811 that spirit is going to stay there with him until the day that is redeemed and God does a plan does redemption in threes we all know that um and Romans 8 to me come on down to where you see that if you got the spirit in you you already got it in you that's your new birth then there's three stages right in here in Romans uh I think it's Romans uh where is it uh led by the spirit that's the second phase there's three phases to the adoption right there's three phases to adoption and number one is uh if you got the spirit that's the new birth number two uh you're led by the spirit that's where U that's stage two and which is the spirit of adoption is whereby you cry have a father uh then you go over to uh I'm I'm just going to kind of jump around here but you go to verse 23 Romans 8:23 and that's the uh the first fruits of course the Redemption of the body and uh that's the part we got to get to right is that and uh I wanted to uh go on into the uh three stages of redemption so is uh the first is of course the Earth was Noah was justified and uh Noah was there and and the Earth was justified by water course Noah had three sons to repopulate the Earth and to take the number three on down the line when Jesus was laying there in the manger here come three wise men from three different parts of the world following that one star that one little light they didn't know each other different uh uh how do you say it different backgrounds uh different heritages that they had come out of like come out of the Wilderness and they come right there and here he is uh those same three come right back after what 2,000 more years here they come the lineages come right back to Christ as he's laying there's a little baby and manger and uh anyway the uh uh also Noah done something else that I I've really he sent out three files and the Raven went one way he he wasn't to be predicted but he did send out the two doves and uh to bring to keep in line with what I'm talking about here with the number number three I'm going to go on to uh the second time uh for the Earth Jesus of course Sanctified it with his blood we all know that and uh Jesus he never uh he always had his three Witnesses with him he had Peter James and John and uh I love that uh in in second Peter I'm not sure if it's second Peter 25 or where it is that uh he's talking about uh he has a more word of Prophecy and here's Peter stood there and seen actually physically seen this U uh transformation if you would that uh Jesus was there and here comes Moses and Elijah talking to him and he seen three and of course he naturally wanted to go back be build three temples I know I mean three three places of worship you know but God was always kind of getting after Peter about some things cuz Peter was was always kind of strong on that and uh the uh uh the the three Witnesses was there with him and uh I wanted to read a section about Peter uh Peter James and John it's a it's a the prophet brought it out about them I right here this uh faith is a substance in Oakland California on a Saturday in 1947 it was 0412 and look at Peter when he was walking by why he was a moral he was born of sinful flesh like you or just like I or you that's right but the people had need of a Healer so they sent God sent Peter to do that specific work John was led Peter didn't have the love in his heart that John had John was God's ageny of love you see look here when he taken Peter James and John hope faith and charity don't you see those gift gifted people them three the hope faith and charity Hope was in James he was the one that set the church in order faith in Peter and charity was in John hope faith and charity it was God's Representatives on the earth and the people laid in Peter's Shadow and were healed oh friends oh my don't think I'm yelling at you friends you you might uh think I'm excited but I'm not I'm trying to get my point to you uh close enough you'll see what I'm talking about um so he had the three Witnesses with him at all times and that's a a wonderful thing because like I said uh to the title I I could sit here and go on and on about the threes Shadrach M and abedo Lord use them right there um of course it's the three works of Grace in our everyday life that we all seek out and look for and uh then of course the coming of the Prophet with the three pulls of the healing the discernment then the open of the word to us um what a what a great thing this that God is doing for for and uh he's doing it he's perfecting Us in threes and U I want to get on to the the last section of the the stages of the Redemption uh we had the Earth and then we've had Jesus sanctifying it by his blood the Earth justified by the water and then of course we got Armageddon which is the termination of forces and U I really didn't want to get a whole lot into that because most of that's in the six seal to me of course it's all in there together but uh it's the termination of the forces there and uh then you come back in to the that's one stage of redemption the second stage of redemption is our natural births that we come uh out of the creation of God we're we're U we're a gene of man we we we come in a sinle state uh we need Redemption um um some of my notes are real small and I can't hardly read cuz I was writing them this morning about 3:00 y'all forgive me but anyway we we need a new birth we're born in sful state and we we project the negative and uh then of course uh you come to the the third stage of this thing which is the new birth uh we're Justified that that man is Justified Sanctified and has received the baptism of the Holy Ghost U he is uh the gene of God he's Heavenly is theophany is perfect mortal uh Immortal is U sinless he uh lives by the word uh is written in the Lamb's Book of Life uh and he possesses the Zoey life and uh it's the real you so Isaiah said that we we look at numbers and I want to say that uh the number seven God displays y'all all know that right that's 70 displays it's like the the the the church ages seals and things like that are strictly a display for us but God always perfects in the threes um and I wanted to whoops tell the clock pardon me uh I wanted to read Ephesians 3:9 and 21 and I'm going to let us go on up because it also want to tell you about three types of people as y'all already know that uh this is uh Hebrews part one Jefferson uh uh in the Cod Wednesday 57092 now let me have something here just show you a little something so you won't forget it going to make you a little illustration I I'm going to put how many um Jer nationalities of people are there in the world and there's three ham sham and japa going back to the the three that had to go out and repopulate after the flood how many know that we came from those three sons of Noah Ham's people shem's people and people is the Anglo-Saxon shim's people is the the three generations that's Jew Gentile and half Jew and Gentile now notice when there and this is ham sham and those are three types of people that Prophet was talking about uh also I want to read the okay we talk right here that uh hear his voice Jeffersonville and and Sunday on U 1958 10:05 a.m. the three stages of of everything there's a stage of the moral body The Immortal body and the glorified body that's three stages of the body uh see just like other things like father son and and uh Holy Spirit goes in one one channel and the three makes the one justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost in a channel makes the one and the soul body and the spirit makes the one and it travels in threes and threes are one and take a three cornered I love this part take a three three cornered piece of glass and lay it in the sun it'll reflect colors yet seven colors will come down to one and you take red and look through red at Red how many knows what red it'll be be white uh isn't that strange that red through red looks white red is the sign of redemption and when you God looks at you your red sins through the red blood of his precious son they're white see so but he has to look through the blood if it doesn't they are sinful so we have to be under the blood and demonology uh first physical connorville Indiana uh d2140 Monday 53608 a.m. now watch this cell let's say for instance like a hot lot of time the red cancer usually hits in the womb of a woman female bruises and so forth now that let's take that and that fellow down on the cells that's cancer let me get on down here to this uh now a cancer everything in the natural types A Spiritual are you aware of that everything in the natural types of spiritual regardless for instance like this when when we're born in the body of Christ there's three elements that takes to bring our birth and that's the three elements that come out of the Life of Christ when he died there come from his body water blood and spirit is that right three elements that's the elements we go through when we're born again justification sanctification baptism the Holy Spirit now that we all be in one act but it takes but you but you can be in a Justified State without being Sanctified you can believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and still carry your filth with you but you can absolutely live in in a both Justified and a clean body or clean holy life and without the Holy Ghost see the Bible First John 5:7 said there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost and father word and Holy Ghost which was a son and there are three in one and there's three that bear record in Earth the water blood and spirit and they agree in one not one but agree in one you can't have the father without having the son and you can't have the son without having the Holy Ghost for they are Inseparable One Trinity is in a one right it's like what is the saying that brother Mo used to use brother I was in the same channel you were yesterday I was reading that Rapture massage where brother saying three is a witness and he said we already had three raptures two in the Old Testament one in the New Testament which Enoch Elijah and Jesus right so we're probably in the same channel amen uh what is that uh that brother Dale was always saying that a person is has a personality the personality is a what is it huh person personality right okay all right U I want to uh go to Ephesians 3:9 I love this scripture uh wow now my eyeballs I need to move my book AP I don't know why most times I can pick it up and I read it no problem um I'm going be on 39 through 21 and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which form the beginning of the word has seen hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God God according to the Eternal purpose which he pursued in Christ Jesus our lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him I see our birth justification sanctification and baptism right there three right there but anyway wherefore I desire that we that ye faith not at my tribulations for you which is your glory for this because I bow my knees or bow my knees unto the father our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is name that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that the Christ dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the bread and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God no now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundant above all we ask of or think according to the power that worketh in US unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages World Without End amen um I think that's all I got this morning for y'all amen I thank y'all for listening to me and being patient and uh sorry it was a little chopped up but good amen thank y'all
