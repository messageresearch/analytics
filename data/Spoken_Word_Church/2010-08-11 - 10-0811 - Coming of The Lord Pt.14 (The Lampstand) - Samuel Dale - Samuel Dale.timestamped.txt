[1:56] good to see everybody if you'd like turn
[1:57] in your scriptures turn where we've been
[1:59] reading
[2:00] and
[2:04] uh I've had quite a while to study on
[2:08] some of the things you know by the other
[2:10] minister Brethren and I appreciate him
[2:12] coming through and ministering for us
[2:14] and and all and I'm sure others will be
[2:18] contacting us later to come but August
[2:21] is generally a scheduled month for me
[2:24] but anyhow we we appreciate it Psalms uh
[2:27] 1118 and then we'll go to Zachariah for
[2:31] um I know you're praying for that
[2:34] brother Jess's boy Allan I mean praying
[2:37] for the family of brother Jess and all
[2:39] of his son Allan that passed away and
[2:42] then the sister in Jamaica their sister
[2:45] um brother Bartley's mother you know
[2:49] about 35 and most of you remember it's
[2:51] probably somewhere over 30 years ago I
[2:54] told you that the Lord had showed me
[2:55] that a lot of people would not be able
[2:57] to come to Rapture in faith and
[3:01] he didn't show me whether I'd be one of
[3:02] them or not so I may not be able to make
[3:04] it but you know the time the change the
[3:07] change I'm talking about now but some
[3:09] would have to go by the grave but that
[3:12] has no problems because they will
[3:14] actually raise before we get our chain
[3:16] so you know there's no disgrace it's an
[3:19] honor it's not a disgrace uh it's an
[3:23] honor to know that you could die for the
[3:25] word of the Lord but I said that many
[3:27] years ago and I still believe it that
[3:30] now you see a lot dying on every hand
[3:33] young and
[3:34] old but I'll tell you something else too
[3:39] I told a
[3:40] brother talking about the brother that
[3:44] had passed in trying to encourage him
[3:48] and uh we were talking about this part
[3:51] of you know maybe a lot of people would
[3:53] have to die and go by the grave and uh I
[3:57] told him something else
[3:59] I told him I had rather
[4:02] preach the funeral of
[4:06] someone that had passed
[4:09] on than to see him walk out the
[4:12] door and turn down the
[4:15] word am that's a hard statement that's
[4:19] right but I'd rather do it amen
[4:23] because a lot of people have turn it
[4:25] down that's right I watch some of you as
[4:29] you
[4:30] fall
[4:32] backward take my word and don't do
[4:36] that I'd rather preach your
[4:39] funeral and you see you walk away from
[4:41] the
[4:43] word
[4:45] okay maybe I shouldn't tell the things
[4:47] that God tells me sometimes but I just
[4:50] do it to try to let you know he is alive
[4:53] and well all right Psalms 118 and
[4:56] Zechariah 4 dear Lord Jesus we thank
[4:59] thank you for an opportunity tonight to
[5:01] be able to come together and to be able
[5:03] to minister your word what a great thing
[5:06] it is to be able to stand before the
[5:08] purchase of the blood of the Lord Jesus
[5:11] Christ and to be able to proclaim the
[5:14] gospel that has been delivered unto us
[5:17] and father we pray that you would just
[5:20] hasten a day and come on the scene
[5:22] because if not a lot more of us going to
[5:24] be dying and going by the grave but we
[5:27] know that all things are within your
[5:29] hand and you said to it nothing's out of
[5:32] cater so it's all there but let us get
[5:35] to our place find what we need to be we
[5:39] love you and we thank you we commit
[5:40] everything into your hands Lord be with
[5:42] brother Bartley and him there with the
[5:44] the loss of the the mother and be with
[5:47] brother Jess brother Claud and them
[5:49] there Lord and the loss of the brother
[5:52] we pray that you would just guide each
[5:54] one and keep us all in your
[5:56] understanding in Jesus name
[6:00] amen Psalms
[6:06] 118 if you don't understand what I said
[6:09] a moment ago
[6:11] then I pray God will reveal it to
[6:16] you open to me the gates of
[6:19] righteousness I will go into them and
[6:21] will praise the Lord this gate of the
[6:24] Lord into which the righteous shall
[6:27] enter that's the Gate of the Lord the
[6:29] Gate of right righteousness I will
[6:31] praise thee for thou Hast heard me and
[6:33] art become my
[6:36] salvation the stone which the builders
[6:38] refused has become The Headstone of the
[6:42] corner this is the Lord's doing it is
[6:44] marvelous in our eyes is the day which
[6:46] the Lord hath made we will rejoice and
[6:48] be glad in it save now I beseech thee Oh

[6:55] Prosperity Blessed Be he that cometh in
[6:57] the name of the Lord we have blessed you
[7:00] out of the house of the Lord
[7:11] Zechariah we just go that one
[7:15] through
[7:17] seven the angel that talked with
[7:21] me came again and wed me as a man that
[7:23] is wakened out of his sleep and he said
[7:26] unto me what seest thou and I said I
[7:28] have looked looked and behold a
[7:30] Candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon
[7:33] the top of it and his seven lamps there
[7:36] own and seven pipes to the seven lamps
[7:39] which are upon the top
[7:41] thereof and two olive trees by it one
[7:44] upon the right side of the bowl and the
[7:47] other upon the left side thereof so I
[7:49] answered and spake to him spake to the
[7:51] angel that talked with me saying what
[7:54] are these my Lord and the angel that
[7:56] talked with me answered and said unto me
[7:59] no not knowest thou not what these be
[8:02] and I said no my Lord then he answered
[8:05] and spake unto me saying this is the
[8:08] word of the Lord unto shubel saying not
[8:12] by might now what he was describing are
[8:15] you are you catching on I keep reading
[8:17] this what he was describing up
[8:20] here is he's now telling you what he
[8:25] saw all right then he answered and spake
[8:28] unto me saying this is is the word of
[8:30] the Lord unto jeral saying not by might
[8:33] nor by power but by my spirit sayth the
[8:35] Lord of hosts who art thou oh great Mar
[8:37] Mountain before zable Thou shalt become
[8:40] a Plaine and he shall bring forth a
[8:41] headstone thereof with shoutings crying
[8:44] Grace Grace unto it amen you may be
[8:47] seated the Lord had his Blessing to the
[8:50] reading of the
[8:53] word
[8:54] now we've
[8:57] been sometime in talking about the
[9:00] coming of the
[9:03] Lord and the prophet of God one day said
[9:07] a man said to him you know said you
[9:08] shouldn't talk to people about the the
[9:11] coming of the Lord cuz you scare them he
[9:14] said if it scares you to know that God
[9:17] is
[9:19] coming you know you shouldn't be you
[9:22] mean the one you served all your life
[9:24] you don't want to see him you know that
[9:26] shouldn't be it but now that's what
[9:28] we've been talking on is the coming of
[9:30] the Lord now tonight I'm just going to
[9:32] hold to one point I have about three
[9:37] sermons already written out that we
[9:40] could go through tonight and be here
[9:42] till
[9:43] daylight and uh you know that wouldn't
[9:45] be no joke if I told
[9:47] you but
[9:49] now I'm trying to get you to
[9:52] see
[9:54] that the coming of the
[9:57] Lord is revealed in the Bible right all
[10:01] right
[10:03] now uh we're not talking about the
[10:06] minute or the hour or whatever
[10:09] right we're talking about the coming of
[10:12] the Lord and what it is
[10:15] amen and it took 4,000 years for the
[10:19] Lord to come here the first time
[10:22] amen and that was written in the Bible
[10:27] right and it's took two 2,000 years now
[10:31] in the second coming of Jesus
[10:35] Christ which is the bride coming of
[10:39] Christ coming out of the church that's
[10:43] right all right now I gave you some
[10:46] quotes and some I'll read some I won I
[10:48] just give them to you to where you'd
[10:51] have them for what we're talking
[10:53] about but you say well the second coming
[10:56] said now nobody knows about it because
[11:00] even Jesus when questioned he he said he
[11:03] didn't know when he was coming that's
[11:07] true but now after his death burial and
[11:11] resurrection and the coming to John on
[11:14] patmas he had went back to where he came
[11:17] from he said I come from God and go to
[11:19] God showing he was God all the time and
[11:22] uh in doing that then he
[11:26] knew there in the Book of Revelation
[11:30] you know and would write about his
[11:34] second coming right
[11:38] now see I believe that because see I
[11:41] believe Jesus and I gave you about three
[11:42] quotes there where that brother randam
[11:45] said on uh number one now number one a
[11:49] is Christ is Christ is the mystery of
[11:51] God reveal he said it's coming is showed
[11:54] our revealed in every type that's in the
[11:56] Bible that's right right so that's
[11:58] enough to know that you can read it in
[12:00] the Bible it's in the Bible about his
[12:02] second coming it was in the Bible about
[12:05] his first coming right all right so it's
[12:07] easily to see that it's in the Bible
[12:09] about his second coming if not where are
[12:11] we going to look for
[12:13] right Jesus Christ was the Fulfillment
[12:16] of all the Old Testament
[12:18] scriptures and walking upon Earth as the
[12:21] word made
[12:22] flesh what else would you expect to be
[12:26] in the end
[12:28] time than to be that way but brother Ram
[12:31] said that Jesus spoke more of his second
[12:34] coming than he did of his first coming
[12:37] that's
[12:38] right now I gave you about three quotes
[12:41] there to where that you could look at it
[12:43] which is second coming of Christ 57
[12:46] Watchman what of the night and
[12:48] 58 uh God's provided way 59 let's read
[12:53] the number
[12:56] four this is Mary's belief 196
[13:03] 1 now we're looking for a messenger in
[13:06] this last days because Jesus said it it
[13:09] would said it would be because all the
[13:13] prophets said it would be melachi said
[13:15] it would be all the prophets have
[13:18] testified Jesus in the very shadow of
[13:20] the Cross spoke more of his second
[13:23] coming than he did of his going
[13:27] away and when we see these things things
[13:29] begin to come to
[13:32] pass what in our day these things begin
[13:35] to come to pass that's
[13:37] right we better go to searching the
[13:40] scriptures because he said there would
[13:43] be false Christ arise and false prophets
[13:46] and will show signs and wonders and so
[13:48] much it would deceive the very elect if
[13:50] it was possible reading just today in
[13:53] the
[13:54] newspaper they said there was a chunk of
[13:56] Ice broke off from Greenland did you
[13:58] read of it
[14:00] that was four times the size of
[14:03] Manhattan now from my understanding I
[14:06] was reading it to look like it was
[14:07] saying 100 square miles and said there
[14:10] was no way to stop
[14:12] it it would move out into the channels
[14:15] moving there's no way cuz it was so big
[14:18] and said that it would be into the
[14:20] shipping lanes and all like that and
[14:23] said you would have possibly a
[14:26] Titanic
[14:27] again you know to happen like that big
[14:30] ship that sunk you know in what 28 or 29
[14:34] or what it was he gave the day even the
[14:36] man himself said that the Bible is being
[14:40] fulfilled in the great things that are
[14:42] taking
[14:43] place see there's no way they can't stop
[14:46] there's nothing they can
[14:47] do but see we better search the
[14:51] scriptures not search the
[14:54] newspapers the newspapers are fine to
[14:56] read they keep us up with current events
[14:59] and things like that and to see what's
[15:01] going on but searching the scriptures
[15:04] the Bible said there in I believe it's
[15:06] in the book of Acts said that they
[15:08] search the Scriptures Daily to see
[15:11] whether these things be right or not you
[15:14] know all right so that's what we need to
[15:16] be doing we need to be searching the
[15:18] scriptures to make sure that we're IR
[15:21] right and making our calling and
[15:23] election sure right
[15:27] see and see trying to find the day that
[15:29] we're living amen because that's what we
[15:31] need to do
[15:34] now backgrounding a little bit because I
[15:37] didn't want I don't want to lose you
[15:38] from what I've
[15:39] said see we realize the only way we can
[15:42] search the
[15:45] scriptures in the correct form is by way
[15:49] of the message of the hour that's right
[15:52] because it would just be man's ideas and
[15:55] opinions right so we search the
[15:57] scriptures by the message of hour in
[16:00] other words we let the prophet tell us
[16:02] what the scriptures are revealing to us
[16:04] right
[16:06] right and now this is just what I wrote
[16:08] down I hope you see that I what I've
[16:10] tried to do and not putting my own
[16:13] thoughts or interpretation to the word
[16:15] of trying to express to you over all of
[16:18] these years and I right this exactly the
[16:20] way I think of course all preachers say
[16:24] that you know but will they take all all
[16:29] that is said by the prophet in the
[16:31] message and the Bible okay now getting
[16:34] on to the
[16:35] point remember we're speaking of the
[16:37] second coming of the Lord which is the
[16:39] bride coming of Christ amen the
[16:42] revealing of God's word amen amen 1
[16:46] Peter 1:23 there says what being born
[16:50] again right by The
[16:53] Incorruptible not corruptible now
[16:57] Incorruptible were word of God right
[17:00] see and the coming out of the church has
[17:04] always been that the bride has to be
[17:07] bured out of the church right church is
[17:10] fine when it's used as bride but when
[17:12] you're using it in the scriptures as
[17:14] church then it's wrong see because it's
[17:18] got its own ideas right so then we can
[17:21] easily
[17:23] see and what's the point of what I'm
[17:25] getting to for a little bit we can
[17:27] easily see that the second coming of
[17:29] Jesus
[17:31] Christ would be like the first coming of
[17:34] Jesus
[17:36] Christ because it would require in his
[17:40] first coming it required a virgin birth
[17:43] of the word amen right right amen that's
[17:46] who Jesus was he was a virgin birth of
[17:48] the word right amen all right so now
[17:50] would not the second coming of Jesus
[17:52] Christ have to be in the same
[17:55] order all right and the prophet says
[17:58] that that on number 5A of your notes see
[18:02] not a with a shook remember a virgin
[18:05] born time if you put it in the hands of
[18:08] a denomination it sure won't be virgin
[18:11] it'll be manhandle time you get it but
[18:15] God's church is not touched by
[18:17] denomination hallelujah it's a virgin
[18:19] born word of God made
[18:22] manifest Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[18:24] today and forever hallelujah how how
[18:27] wonderful I love in I believe it I know
[18:30] that it's the truth it not be touched
[18:32] there be no denominational manhandling
[18:34] in the Virgin birth of the Bride am no
[18:37] sir she she's commanded by God to come
[18:41] out of such touch not their unclean
[18:43] things they become vultures what
[18:48] now we got to come out of the church and
[18:52] be bured out of the church and I mean
[18:54] this as much as I could mean anything in
[18:57] my life we've got to be birt out of the
[19:00] church at Lula amen if you think am man
[19:03] told me one time he said I I left where
[19:06] I was at and came here because I wanted
[19:08] to follow the Lula thing I said brother
[19:11] that was the first mistake you made
[19:13] right that's right cuz there is no Lula
[19:15] thing amen he said well I wanted to come
[19:18] here and I could preach on Wednesdays
[19:21] and you could preach on Sundays oh my
[19:24] amen I kind of figured him out real
[19:27] quick he had his thing
[19:30] but all
[19:32] right but now see we've got to be Burt
[19:35] out of our own ideas is what I mean
[19:37] what's being birthed out of the church
[19:39] what is that a new birth being birthed
[19:42] out of your own ideas the new birth
[19:45] brings you to a condition that you don't
[19:48] let the human mind control you let the
[19:51] soul the inner part of you the being
[19:54] that you are you let that control you
[19:57] and that's what it means by by the
[19:59] Virgin birth of the word well it
[20:00] couldn't have been a virgin birth of the
[20:02] word there's no way to be a virgin birth
[20:04] of the word until first they was a a
[20:06] virgin word brought right so you see why
[20:10] the prophet's message had to come that
[20:12] God had to send a prophet or in Mei he
[20:15] said if he hadn't he would have smoked
[20:16] the Earth with a curse Malachi 4 other
[20:19] words it done been destroyed you think
[20:20] it's in bad shape now you know but look
[20:24] at it you know just just forget all
[20:27] about what that is and look to the word
[20:29] all right now I gave you the quote back
[20:31] which I always give you which is number
[20:33] five on your notes page 308 of the seal
[20:35] book where the second coming is the
[20:38] rapture now that's what your Prophet
[20:41] said and he says we must meet him in the
[20:44] skies
[20:46] Immortal he doesn't come here as a
[20:48] mortal being all right now I give you
[20:51] this one back because I want to keep it
[20:52] there number six on your notes is what
[20:56] what the Holy Ghost was given for 59127
[20:59] says God is waiting on me and
[21:02] you now listen God is waiting on me and
[21:06] you the church is waiting on me and you
[21:10] adoption time when God can pour into us
[21:14] his fullness his power his resurrection
[21:18] that when the church and Christ become
[21:20] so close together till Christ becomes
[21:23] visible Among Us and raises the dead and
[21:26] we go into the rapture all right right
[21:30] now it should be simple enough to be
[21:32] able to
[21:34] understand why that we're keep reading
[21:36] there in in uh Psalms because it says
[21:40] that he's become The Headstone of the
[21:43] corner
[21:44] right an adop will require and I'm not
[21:48] all I'm going to do is hit this back up
[21:49] got about 3 weeks down the road I'll be
[21:52] back to it but see adoption time is when
[21:56] God can put his trust in to the people
[21:59] right and you remember what I was trying
[22:01] to preach there a couple of services
[22:03] back that in The Headstone will be the
[22:07] most visibility form of God that will be
[22:10] here before the Rapture comes right I
[22:13] believe that I believe the headstone
[22:15] will be the VIS visibility you say signs
[22:17] and
[22:19] wonders I thought that was what I was
[22:21] saying all right you know I mean I I
[22:24] thought that's what I was trying to
[22:25] bring out because you won't have
[22:27] adoption time without manifested Sons
[22:29] and Daughters right I thought that was
[22:32] what I was trying to say sometimes I
[22:33] don't explain that and you know people
[22:35] think well don't wor s about okay I
[22:38] guess I don't but I know a God that
[22:41] does see but what I'm trying to do is
[22:44] get you and I to look into the
[22:48] Bible and see the Bible is talking about
[22:51] us amen and revealing our place right in
[22:56] the Bible right mhm seeing ourselves in
[23:00] the Bible right recognizing your day in
[23:03] its message right to see where we're at
[23:05] and what's going on right now all right
[23:10] see we covered how that
[23:12] Zachariah saw the
[23:16] coming of the seven Church ages
[23:20] right and the revealing of Jesus Christ
[23:24] in those
[23:26] ages you remember the message
[23:30] that Zachariah because it says not by
[23:33] power not by might but by the holy
[23:34] spirit amen and you remember what I told
[23:37] you the way you reading it in Zechariah
[23:39] Zachariah don't know he doesn't know
[23:42] what these candlesticks are he doesn't
[23:44] know what these olive trees are he
[23:46] doesn't know anything about it and God
[23:48] says listen Zechariah this is the word
[23:50] of the Lord under rable
[23:55] amen so what is the church ages and the
[23:58] Seven golden candlesticks right
[24:02] amen what did we go through with
[24:05] Revelations 1 in verse 12 through about
[24:08] 16 there how that you see in Revelations
[24:11] 1 you see one in the midst of the seven
[24:14] golden candlesticks like unto the son of
[24:17] man it says gir about the PS with a
[24:20] golden
[24:22] girdle the girl is moved is not in the
[24:25] servitude part of it's in the point of
[24:27] showing the what paths
[24:30] femin that's the bride showed in the
[24:33] seven Church agent I gave you that read
[24:36] it then number n number seven on your
[24:38] notes and why that we're not a
[24:42] denomination the prophet was saying
[24:45] what if you notice we find Jesus
[24:49] standing in the seven Church ages and
[24:52] the Seven golden
[24:54] candlesticks when he turned and saw one
[24:56] like unto the son of man stand en
[24:58] clothed how was it it was a bride
[25:02] standing in the candlesticks drawn out y
[25:07] amen that's what he was
[25:10] shown now watch in a minute because
[25:13] we're going to get into this Candlestick
[25:17] lampstand and we're going to make
[25:20] one
[25:22] statement and everything has to tie
[25:25] together with it or else we don't have
[25:27] the right revelation
[25:31] now the natural back there they made a
[25:36] Candlestick it was in the inner Court
[25:38] not in the holy of holies it was in the
[25:40] inner
[25:43] court all right it was there where that
[25:46] they would keep it lit because the
[25:48] curtains was pulled around there was no
[25:50] light in there that's
[25:54] right but it was not in behind the holy
[25:56] of holies now right
[25:58] but it was put there by
[26:02] Moses and when it was doing it then what
[26:05] was Moses speaking of well he just made
[26:06] a leftand he just went on made a
[26:09] left I got to look in these things
[26:13] up
[26:16] and if you'll read in the scripture
[26:18] there you'll find that Moses we'll get
[26:20] to it in a little while he said that
[26:22] that uh Candlestick was made from one
[26:26] Talent of gold
[26:32] now Wikia the best they can do on it
[26:36] says it that's about 75
[26:41] lb right now 75 lb of gold it says that
[26:46] Solon or David one of the two David I
[26:49] think had
[26:51] 666 talents of gold brought in
[26:54] yearly to making all of the
[26:57] things try to run some things on it and
[26:59] you get on over into the New Testament
[27:01] with the scriptures and you find out
[27:03] that in the New Testament a talet would
[27:06] probably weigh about 200 lb you remember
[27:09] over there in the Book of Revelations
[27:11] where it talks about how The Hil Stones
[27:13] would fall out of the sky and it says
[27:15] they we tet that's about 200 lb so
[27:19] irregardless of what I'm talking about
[27:21] the point is if it weighs 75 lb or 200
[27:25] lb it was a big old thing
[27:29] it wasn't no little old bitty thing that
[27:31] we look at like it's up here at the
[27:32] front down there you know and I gave you
[27:34] a picture of it and we'll get to that in
[27:36] a minute but the point I want you to see
[27:40] is that Candlestick was
[27:44] made and when it was made it would be
[27:47] brought over to
[27:49] Zachariah Zachariah would catch more
[27:52] than Moses would about it but I'll
[27:54] repeat this again in a minute about 10
[27:56] times
[27:58] when Moses built that Candlestick
[28:02] Zachariah could
[28:04] not make it of any other way right and
[28:08] neither could The Book of Revelation
[28:10] right it could show what it
[28:14] meant but it couldn't be made any
[28:16] difference that's right because it's
[28:18] Hebrews 13:8 right all right so now in
[28:22] Revelations one he's one standing in the
[28:23] midst of the seven golden Candlestick so
[28:25] what was Zechariah being shown the this
[28:28] is the word of the Lord unto
[28:33] zerubabel what the building of the
[28:36] candlesticks the bride is the word of
[28:39] the Lord you remember what I was trying
[28:40] to bring out on that each age was the
[28:42] word made manifest for the age they were
[28:44] living in that's right and see in doing
[28:48] that then each one has got to be seeing
[28:51] the same
[28:52] thing if not what are you going to
[28:55] do but now listen to the next one number
[28:58] eight on your
[28:59] notes this is taken from 49 of the
[29:01] church age book which is patas Vision as
[29:04] I turned to see the voice that spake
[29:06] with me and being turned I saw seven
[29:08] golden
[29:09] candlesticks John does not say that he
[29:11] turned to see the one whose voice he
[29:14] heard but he turned to see the voice oh
[29:17] I like that and he turned to see the
[29:19] voice the voice and the person are one
[29:22] and the same that's right Jesus is the
[29:25] word right now what was Zachariah
[29:29] shown the word right of the Lord unders
[29:33] rable but what was he shown up in
[29:35] Revelation one standing in the midst of
[29:37] seven golden Candlestick a bride draw
[29:40] out listen the voice and the person are
[29:43] one and the same Jesus is the word John
[29:45] 1 in the beginning was the word and word
[29:46] with God and word was with God the same
[29:48] was in the beginning with God all things
[29:51] were
[29:51] made by him and without him was not
[29:54] anything made that was made if you ever
[29:57] get to really see the word word you'll
[29:59] be seeing Jesus right listen I love that
[30:04] when John turned continuation of the
[30:06] reading he saw seven golden
[30:09] candlesticks actually they were
[30:13] lampstands and according to verse 20
[30:16] they are the seven Church ages the seven
[30:19] Candlestick that all are the seven
[30:21] Church ages to represent the church that
[30:24] could be that could hardly be candle
[30:29] a candle burns but a while and then it
[30:32] is burned out it dies there would be no
[30:36] more to it but lampstands possess a
[30:38] lasting quality not found in candles all
[30:42] right now so your Prophet is giving you
[30:46] the definition that when Moses built a
[30:50] lamp stand he built I mean a Candlestick
[30:53] he was actually building a lamp standand
[30:56] right right m but they called it a
[31:01] Candlestick cuz it's not candles stuck
[31:04] up on a stick you know whatever no no
[31:07] it's got to be
[31:08] correct and see when John saw
[31:11] it on
[31:14] patmas he saw a wonderful thing that he
[31:18] could see the bride standing in the
[31:21] candlesticks or the loun
[31:24] stand now we want to get that loun stand
[31:26] cuz that's the message that we're
[31:27] getting to
[31:29] tonight is the
[31:32] lampstand he was standing in
[31:36] that now watch look on down to patas
[31:39] Vision 1960 1204 the evening service
[31:43] number 9A read them A's is in there I
[31:45] pick these up later and I put them back
[31:47] in I cut and paste and give them to you
[31:51] okay cuz I don't care I don't know much
[31:54] about these lap stands and things like
[31:56] that except what the prophet has to say
[31:58] about it cuz that's where I get it
[32:00] from now what is a
[32:03] Candlestick it is a lamp
[32:05] stain and notice how beautiful here when
[32:08] he turned he saw this one like the son
[32:11] of man here standing in the midst of the
[32:13] seven golden Lou stands which means
[32:16] seven Church ages to come remember where
[32:20] John was at looking right and each pipe
[32:24] or lampstand hooked into the main big
[32:27] oil sensor
[32:28] and this oil come forth up to a little
[32:31] old shaped odd shaped
[32:34] lamp that set with a wick in it and the
[32:37] wick hung down in the oil and that as
[32:40] long they poured oil into the top of the
[32:42] stand which filling filled up the main
[32:45] big
[32:46] stem and the Big Branch as it run out
[32:50] into the stems like this and the lamp
[32:54] with a wick hanging down this this
[32:57] piping into kept the burner day and kept
[33:01] burning day and night you never have to
[33:03] light it you could it kept burning you
[33:06] talking about the wick from the lamp
[33:07] down into there got his life out of
[33:10] here oh what different it is from a
[33:13] candle how different is a
[33:16] lampstand is pulling oil am
[33:21] now he was seeing the bride of Christ
[33:25] amen and the holy ghost in the bride
[33:30] right not by power not by might
[33:33] Zachariah but by my spirit sayth the
[33:36] Lord all right the Bible speaks in the
[33:39] Book of Revelations of seven spirits of
[33:41] God there's not seven spirits of God
[33:44] because it's not seven gods your Prophet
[33:46] explains it it is one spirit manifested
[33:50] in seven Church ages one for you know
[33:52] the Holy Ghost for each age is
[33:54] explaining the seven of that now
[33:59] but what I want you to think about for a
[34:02] minute the scripture has to give us the
[34:05] true
[34:07] interpretation and we must start then
[34:10] with
[34:13] Zachariah if Zachariah and John will see
[34:17] the same
[34:18] thing you got to be getting close right
[34:21] right I mean that's
[34:23] senseful so now this is going to require
[34:25] a little thinking with you
[34:29] I'd like for you to draw
[34:31] me the
[34:34] picture that
[34:37] Moses done back there in the scripture
[34:41] in Exodus let's go back
[34:46] there I'd like for you to draw me that
[34:49] picture and come out any other way
[34:53] then what that lampstand is
[34:59] so let's read this that Moses was to
[35:03] build and then you draw
[35:09] it and I'd be glad for you to bring it
[35:11] up here if you draw it and show it to me
[35:14] whatever but look what Moses Exodus 25
[35:18] and you also find in Exodus 37 you know
[35:20] will be another time that it
[35:22] shown 25:31
[35:28] let's read verse 40 where you
[35:31] start and look that thou make them after
[35:34] their pattern which was showed thee in
[35:36] the
[35:38] mount and Moses build this
[35:42] lampstand after the pattern you
[35:45] see in the mount verse
[35:48] 40 you'll find it in numbers 8 and
[35:53] 4 you'll find Paul speaking of it in
[35:56] Hebrews 8 and5
[35:58] that it was made after the pattern that
[36:01] Moses saw in the mount now let's see
[36:04] let's read what he
[36:06] saw and let's see what he
[36:08] built and thou shalt make a Candlestick
[36:11] of pure gold verse
[36:12] 31 of beaten work shall the Candlestick
[36:15] be
[36:17] made his shaft and his branches his
[36:21] bowls his knops I guess the way you
[36:23] pronounce that K PS and his flowers
[36:26] shall be of the same all of it's going
[36:30] to be pure gold right
[36:35] okay so now you draw this and six
[36:38] branches shall come out of the sides of
[36:40] it three branches out of the Candlestick
[36:43] out of the one side and three branches
[36:45] of the Candlestick out of the other side
[36:48] three bowls made like of the almonds
[36:50] with a knock and a flower in a one
[36:52] branch and three bowls made like almonds
[36:55] in the other branch
[36:59] with a knp and a flower so in the six
[37:01] branches that come out of the
[37:05] Candlestick and in the Candlestick shall
[37:07] be four bowls made like un almonds with
[37:10] their knots and their flowers and there
[37:13] shall be a knp under two branches of the
[37:15] same and a knp under two branches of the
[37:18] same and a knp under two branches of the
[37:20] same according to the six branches that
[37:21] precede out of the
[37:23] Candlestick their knots and their
[37:25] branches shall be of the same all of it
[37:28] shall be one beaten work of pure gold
[37:33] solid all of it one work
[37:38] solid right th shall
[37:41] make the seven lamps
[37:44] thereof and they shall light the lamps
[37:46] thereof that they may give light over
[37:48] against it then he talks about the
[37:50] tongues therefore and snuff dishes and
[37:54] the things and of a talent of pure shall
[37:58] he make it with all these vessels now
[38:02] something waying at least we'll have to
[38:04] consider from 75 lb to 200
[38:09] lb and they've got pictures if you want
[38:11] to run them into your in your uh you
[38:14] know computer on your internet they got
[38:16] pictures of where they were taken down
[38:18] in and and they're even depicted over at
[38:21] Rong Italy
[38:23] now and showing the things but a tallet
[38:27] of pure
[38:29] gold
[38:30] now you know also I'm sure that gold is
[38:35] not
[38:36] measured
[38:39] in pounds I'm just going to give you
[38:44] this it's measured it by
[38:47] Troy gold you go down to a store and say
[38:51] I want one pound of gold you know what
[38:54] they're going to give you
[38:57] they're going to give you 12
[39:04] O you just lost money didn't you
[39:10] yeah it's a Troy oun is what you measure
[39:13] and things when you're measuring
[39:15] gold so don't go in and try to figure
[39:17] out how that you got beat all of this
[39:19] you you asked for a pound and you get 12
[39:22] oz because it's a Troy it's like you go
[39:26] down to the baker and you want a dozen
[39:28] donuts how many do you get 13 you get
[39:34] 13 all right cuz that's a Baker's Dozen
[39:37] that's right I've done a little study on
[39:39] this to show you cuz measurements from
[39:42] every different country was entirely
[39:44] different and it's still in to some
[39:46] degrees and actually gold and different
[39:49] things was measured by the Romans by a
[39:51] little old cylinder about that long that
[39:54] you could pour certain amount of water
[39:56] in it and that was the weight of the
[39:59] gold and water is like what six almost
[40:02] six lbs per gallon so youd have to
[40:06] calculate I'm just showing you that so
[40:08] as somebody comes along and said well he
[40:09] didn't really know what he talking about
[40:11] so I just picked up a lot of the other
[40:13] things to to give you a little light on
[40:15] it but
[40:16] now draw me out that
[40:20] picture that Moses
[40:23] saw now if he hadn't seen it he'd have
[40:26] been in trouble
[40:28] right you read it and draw
[40:35] it you read
[40:38] Zachariah and draw
[40:44] it you got branches you got all kind of
[40:46] things to be consumed there and over in
[40:49] Zachariah you find out that there's two
[40:51] olive
[40:52] trees so you got a funny looking outfit
[40:57] you got
[40:59] bowls you
[41:02] got plots which is
[41:05] bugs you got all kind of
[41:09] things but thank God what Moses made is
[41:15] exactly what he saw in
[41:20] heaven and when he got through making it
[41:23] it's identical to the scripture
[41:30] see what I'm saying is when God showed a
[41:32] man something he showed him what he
[41:37] wanted he told him what he wanted but he
[41:40] showed it to
[41:43] him he come down off the
[41:46] mountain and this is what he
[41:51] made the seven golden
[41:55] candlesticks and it's identical to the
[42:02] scripture what I'm trying to get you to
[42:04] see the Perfection of God's word
[42:08] amen now Zachariah what he saw can't be
[42:12] draw out to look like
[42:21] this what John draw on the a of patmas
[42:25] wouldn't look like that right
[42:33] if it's not revealed that's what I'm
[42:35] talking about a prophet of God God
[42:39] speaks to the to Moses and tells him
[42:42] exactly you go sometime and try to
[42:45] figure out how to build that
[42:47] tent right and you will go
[42:51] Haywire trying to figure out all the
[42:54] things but see Moses saw it
[43:01] amen now Moses didn't
[43:06] see what John saw on patmas with the son
[43:10] of man standing in the midst of the
[43:11] golden can ex no he saw exactly what God
[43:14] wanted him to
[43:18] say and he made it
[43:21] amen but when he got to making it you
[43:24] got to have that every time as a
[43:26] foundation
[43:29] to keep it lined
[43:32] up that might get interesting a little
[43:35] bit so you might think it's just boring
[43:37] but I would ask you to draw it
[43:41] out you know to just sometimes draw out
[43:44] what you
[43:45] think but just save you a lot of trouble
[43:47] just go get what
[43:49] Moses and this will identically fit the
[43:52] scriptures now here's what people get me
[43:55] because they did about the 70 weeks of
[43:56] day Daniel about all the things we don't
[43:59] need to know about all of these things
[44:01] all we need to know is
[44:03] revelation that's what I'm talking about
[44:06] when I talking about Daniel 70 weeks the
[44:09] revelation of Jesus Christ not dates and
[44:12] times and Seasons I told you
[44:14] that those were all of the natural
[44:17] things so is
[44:22] this but now watch we read enough from
[44:26] the prophet
[44:27] to show that it was Jesus Christ
[44:29] standing in the midst of the seven
[44:30] golden C standing in the bride that John
[44:34] turned to hear the voice the voice and
[44:36] the person is the same and when he did
[44:38] he saw the bride amen you remember what
[44:41] I've tried to get you to see that the
[44:42] Book of Revelations find me Jesus by
[44:45] himself in the Book of
[44:48] Revelations somebody bring it to
[44:51] me you said well what about that
[44:54] lamb I'm glad you thought of that
[44:59] that lamb in Revelation that seven horns
[45:01] and seven eyes which is the seven
[45:03] spirits of God that went forth in the
[45:05] earth and your prophet of God said that
[45:07] lamb came from the church
[45:11] ages
[45:13] amen if you know what you're talking
[45:15] about you're not afraid
[45:18] right because you just stand and say
[45:20] well that's it you know let's see it
[45:23] let's see you draw I'm not being
[45:25] sarcastic I'm trying not this to save
[45:27] your
[45:29] soul just the natural to show you is the
[45:33] natural let me ask you a simple
[45:37] question we know for certainty that they
[45:39] used olive oil because it was two olive
[45:41] trees right
[45:45] right will olive oil
[45:52] burn what degree of temperature would
[45:54] you have to get olive oil to to make it
[45:56] burn
[46:00] can you strike a match to
[46:02] a bottle of olive oil or something you
[46:06] don't do it to gas do you and you don't
[46:08] do it with oil down there because that's
[46:10] what they've been showing you that they
[46:11] can burn the stuff that's L up on top of
[46:13] the water
[46:16] right that's what I love about your
[46:20] prophet he was not only a man that knew
[46:23] the word of God but he was a simple man
[46:26] that understood simple
[46:30] things I gave you a quote we'll get to
[46:32] it in a few minutes the Lord willing he
[46:34] said if you're running low on oil in
[46:36] your lamp do you know what you
[46:39] do what would you think you do if you're
[46:41] running low on oil in your
[46:47] lamp what would you think you'd pour
[46:49] into
[46:51] it you pour
[46:54] water pour water in to the lamp and oil
[46:59] comes to the top you just got to make
[47:01] sure you raise your Wick up
[47:05] right
[47:07] amen all right so we established one
[47:10] thing for
[47:11] certain that this lamp
[47:14] stand is not something to where that you
[47:16] got a Coleman's lantern that you pour
[47:19] gas in and you pump it up and it sprays
[47:21] up and out comes the
[47:25] fire no
[47:28] it's got to have a way of
[47:30] working okay all right so now let's look
[47:34] you got the the little drawing you know
[47:37] brother Joe put this on the computers I
[47:39] don't know how he'll show up on that
[47:41] because we'll do something with it on
[47:44] the video but let's read
[47:48] this cuz remember my point we'll get
[47:50] back to
[47:51] it when Zachariah was shown the
[47:55] lampstand candlesticks
[47:59] that was way over in the Bible Moses had
[48:02] already built the lamp stand the
[48:07] candlesticks in Exodus
[48:10] 25 so Zachariah knew what the lampstand
[48:15] meant he just couldn't understand the
[48:17] other things that went with
[48:19] it
[48:22] right because what he couldn't
[48:25] understand was all of this about the the
[48:27] pups and the bubs and the do and the
[48:30] this and that and he couldn't understand
[48:31] the two olive
[48:36] trees do you understand the two olive
[48:39] trees oh yeah Moses
[48:45] Elijah brother brandham said it was
[48:49] the church
[48:52] ages old and new
[48:57] we'll get to something in a minute if we
[49:00] get that far Aaron asked me a question
[49:02] about something the other day because in
[49:04] Zachariah you find that there's one
[49:06] lampstand Candlestick you find in the
[49:08] Revelation Book of Revelations in the
[49:10] third 11th chapter that there's two
[49:20] candlesticks what's going on but let's
[49:23] take this little drawing just a minute
[49:27] and let's just look at
[49:28] it and let's
[49:30] read and see if Moses done what he
[49:35] said cuz verse 31 it says Thou shalt
[49:37] make a Candlestick of pure gold a beaten
[49:41] work shall the Candlestick be
[49:43] mate his
[49:46] shaft now
[49:49] shaft is a
[49:54] bowl you're going to look at it like a
[49:56] sh sha shaft right it's a
[50:02] b or a base and put it that
[50:08] way and his
[50:13] branches branch is a
[50:18] reed or a
[50:23] stalk you know to keep you where you
[50:25] won't dry up on me I thought Jesus said
[50:28] that he was the vine and we were the
[50:30] what
[50:32] right okay I thought we just make sure
[50:35] you don't dry up
[50:39] see and his
[50:41] bowls are his bowls bowls are cups now
[50:45] I'm giving you the definition out of
[50:47] strong
[50:50] concordance and the k and o PS
[50:53] knots those knots are bubs be
[51:00] lb and you got the
[51:03] flowers and the flowers is talked about
[51:05] is knots and bugs you know better all
[51:09] right
[51:12] now and six branches shall come out of
[51:15] the base of
[51:17] it here's your
[51:19] base coming up six branches he said wait
[51:24] a minute there's seven well let's don't
[51:26] get that far we got a more scripture to
[51:27] cover
[51:29] first six
[51:33] branches
[51:37] look three branches of the Candlestick
[51:39] out of the one side and three branches
[51:41] of the Candlestick out of the other side
[51:42] so that's easy to look
[51:45] at then you got three bowls made like
[51:48] under
[51:52] almonds can you find some almonds on
[51:54] there
[51:58] with a knp and a flower in one
[52:05] branch and three bowls made like
[52:09] almonds in the other branch in other
[52:12] words each one of these branches you got
[52:13] to have three
[52:19] bowls so in the six branches that come
[52:21] out of the
[52:22] Candlestick all right so what are you
[52:24] looking for
[52:26] but in the candles stick which is
[52:28] referring to the center section there's
[52:31] four
[52:43] bowls and under each one of the
[52:47] branches verse
[52:50] 35 and there shall be a knot under two
[52:54] branches what is a knot bub BB bub right
[52:59] not a light bub
[53:02] now and a KN under two branches the same
[53:06] and a knp under two branches the same
[53:07] according to the six branches that
[53:09] preset free day out of the
[53:12] Candlestick
[53:14] no simply look at
[53:21] it look right down under each one of the
[53:25] on the candlesticks
[53:27] and you'll find three bowls right one
[53:30] two three three bowls on each one of
[53:33] them all right
[53:36] okay three bowls for each L but remember
[53:40] the key one there says there was four in
[53:42] the center one just come down the shaft
[53:46] get down to the bottom of the shaft
[53:47] right above where it starts and right
[53:50] there's another
[53:51] Bowl right
[53:56] so he's got his bowls
[54:01] right let put the bowls in it all right
[54:05] so you put a knp under each one of the
[54:07] sets of branches the knp is a
[54:10] bub bub bub bub 1 2 3 now you got 1 2 3
[54:15] 4 5 6 7 bubs up at the top one under
[54:19] right over the top of each
[54:22] cup you got a
[54:24] bub a KN which is a bu
[54:27] all right you're looking for a flower
[54:28] just looked right above the knot and
[54:30] there's pretty beautiful flowers draw
[54:32] out around on each side of each one of
[54:35] the
[54:36] candlesticks all right then in the top
[54:38] the top of it is what we have to get
[54:40] over into the other scripture in a
[54:41] minute to find it but it's uh you get
[54:44] over to it and when you do you'll find
[54:48] uh that that's lamps on top
[54:53] right
[54:54] okay Moses you've got that part right
[54:57] what about the other where is the two
[55:00] Olive
[55:02] branches where is the olive
[55:10] oil right down here in the
[55:13] bottom it's poured
[55:18] in it says it's poured in the shaft
[55:22] remember now this is all solid I Reon I
[55:24] wanted you to refer to that it's made of
[55:27] one solid piece right they don't pour
[55:29] this one out and pour oil down to that
[55:32] shaft no the oil comes up through the
[55:35] shaft from where down in the
[55:38] bottom but it don't get up there by
[55:41] itself so when we get over into
[55:45] Zachariah we've got to keep this
[55:50] picture we got to say this is what
[55:52] Zachariah saw
[55:58] it won't fit together if you
[56:01] don't so we go over to
[56:11] Zachariah Zachariah says the angel talk
[56:13] with me came again wake me as a man out
[56:15] of his sleep he said unto me what sayest
[56:17] thou and I said I have looked and behold
[56:20] a lamp a
[56:22] Candlestick all of gold and a bowl of on
[56:26] the top of
[56:31] it now draw
[56:35] that a bowl up on the top of it what do
[56:39] you mean draw it's a Candlestick in
[56:41] there with a bowl on it now the bows is
[56:44] the bowls are just showed you three of
[56:45] them under each
[56:48] one it's not up on top hanging up in the
[56:53] sky with a bowl up on the top of it and
[56:55] his seven lamps there on see there's
[56:58] your seven top thing seven
[57:01] lamps the light is up at the top
[57:04] right in the
[57:10] lamps which are upon the top thereof and
[57:13] two olive trees by it one upon the right
[57:15] side of the bowl the other on the left
[57:17] side thereof see that's where you run
[57:20] over and you say well you got to have
[57:21] now you got to draw out these it won't
[57:24] fit Moses
[57:33] go ahead and say it the reason you got
[57:35] olive trees listed is because that's
[57:38] where you get the olive
[57:42] oil off the olive trees right
[57:49] right you see the oil is poured down in
[57:54] here okay right
[57:58] now olive oil won't
[58:01] burn so what do you got to
[58:05] have a way to get the olive oil up
[58:08] through the shaft
[58:10] right okay look at 9
[58:15] a on your quotes pmas Vision 1960 1204
[58:20] 156 one I just
[58:23] read what is a Candlestick it's a
[58:25] lampstand
[58:26] notice how beautiful here when he turned
[58:28] he saw this one like the son of man here
[58:31] standing in the midst of the seven
[58:32] golden lamp stands which means seven
[58:35] Church ages to come and each pip or
[58:38] lampstand hooked into the main big oil
[58:42] sensor and in this oil come forth up to
[58:46] a little odd shaped lamp that's up on
[58:49] the top
[58:51] thing that set with a wick in it
[58:59] now Moses didn't describe a
[59:09] wick Moses described the
[59:12] L and
[59:16] oil but you got to have that
[59:20] wi
[59:22] okay odd-shaped lamp that set with a
[59:25] wick in it and the wick hung down in the
[59:27] oil as long as they poured oil in the
[59:29] top of the stand which filled up the
[59:31] main big stem and the big branches as it
[59:35] run out into the stems like this and the
[59:37] lamp with the wick hanging down this
[59:40] this pip into that kept burning day
[59:43] night the
[59:46] wick now if you can't find the hold on a
[59:52] minute you got to have a wig how many of
[59:54] you ever run a lamp right amen okay
[59:57] we're all old enough basically at least
[59:59] the seen one even the
[1:00:04] kids the oil is not necessarily now
[1:00:07] listen
[1:00:09] burning it's the
[1:00:12] wick that the oil is coming up in right
[1:00:16] kerosene in other words
[1:00:19] true and you set up the wick on fire
[1:00:26] and as long as there's oil in the bottom
[1:00:28] it'll automatically Wick itself up
[1:00:32] right you just light it and it'll Wick
[1:00:37] it that's why you got to cut it off trim
[1:00:40] it you got to do all kind of things to
[1:00:41] it and that's what they had to do
[1:00:47] too so the lamp stand by
[1:00:51] itself that Moses was shown to
[1:00:54] draw won't bring you the
[1:00:57] picture of the Book of Revelations and
[1:00:59] the Seven golden Candlestick neither
[1:01:01] will it bring you to Zachariah which
[1:01:03] would be the word of the
[1:01:07] Lord you got to have the
[1:01:11] wick Escape come hither
[1:01:14] quickly number nine down on your notes
[1:01:17] paragraph
[1:01:18] 39 how love that parable of the
[1:01:21] Virgin and you know the old Co oil Wick
[1:01:25] Co L we used to have he never had lights
[1:01:28] till this just recently look here the
[1:01:30] oil's in the bottom of the lamp and
[1:01:32] there's a wick that draws it
[1:01:34] up now that Wick has to be a special
[1:01:37] made piece of
[1:01:38] material and the fire comes on the end
[1:01:41] of the
[1:01:44] wick and now notice you couldn't put a
[1:01:46] pipe down in
[1:01:48] there and it would draw it
[1:01:50] up he's telling
[1:01:53] you you couldn't put a pipe there it
[1:01:56] just run up turn the thing upside down
[1:01:57] you might have a chance but oil won't
[1:01:59] burn that way that kind olive
[1:02:04] oil cursing would
[1:02:10] but you couldn't put a pipe down in
[1:02:12] there and it would draw it up it won't
[1:02:14] come through iron made man-made things
[1:02:18] it only comes through God's provided way
[1:02:21] and the wick is faith
[1:02:26] and the only thing that can pull the
[1:02:28] Holy Spirit into uh light is the Holy
[1:02:31] Ghost
[1:02:33] itself and when you get when you got
[1:02:36] your
[1:02:37] faith one end of it on fire for the
[1:02:41] glory of God and the other dipped into
[1:02:44] God's holy ghost oil there's going to be
[1:02:47] a Shining Light just as certain as I'm
[1:02:49] standing in
[1:02:51] thein got to have a wick
[1:02:56] okay number 10 patmas Vision 162 I would
[1:03:00] invite you to read patmas Vision or
[1:03:02] listen to it 60
[1:03:04] 12:04 these lamp stems all fit into one
[1:03:07] great big bow one great big holder and
[1:03:10] nine different or seven different
[1:03:12] lampstands come out of it lamp holders
[1:03:14] ex come out of it and when they did each
[1:03:17] one of those lights was drawing from the
[1:03:18] main resource of its life and its life
[1:03:22] was because it
[1:03:23] had because it
[1:03:26] its candle dipped down into this main
[1:03:29] bar had its candle dipped down into this
[1:03:31] main barel Oh what a beautiful picture
[1:03:34] of one of those Seven Stars that's
[1:03:36] represented there with his life on fire
[1:03:37] with the Holy Ghost and by by faith he's
[1:03:41] burning with a Holy Ghost and his life
[1:03:43] is a candle or not a candle but a wick
[1:03:47] that's dipped into the Holy Spirit into
[1:03:50] Christ and through that Wick he's
[1:03:51] drawing the life of God out to give
[1:03:54] light to his church oh oh what a picture
[1:03:56] of the True
[1:03:58] Believer amen now you're seeing John did
[1:04:01] see Jesus Christ standing in the church
[1:04:04] Moses tried to build what he saw but he
[1:04:07] just buil a lampstand right
[1:04:10] amen zachari is picking up the point
[1:04:12] because he's told it's the word of
[1:04:15] God seal of God 1961 to16 he talking
[1:04:19] about it's lamp trimming time yes it
[1:04:22] needs trimming
[1:04:23] Pentecost better be trimming some lamps
[1:04:26] amen get a lot of this wh cut away from
[1:04:29] you you done got corroded over the Wicks
[1:04:33] got in bad shape now anybody that ever
[1:04:34] run a lamp like that you got to take it
[1:04:36] and cut that off right you just
[1:04:39] literally cut it off raise it up cut it
[1:04:41] off light it again right right CU if you
[1:04:44] don't it Just Smokes like a taril and
[1:04:46] won't give no light
[1:04:48] whatsoever throt it over the Wicks got
[1:04:51] in bad shape you know that Wick is a
[1:04:53] great thing I used to want
[1:04:57] what a real Wick of God is a a Believer
[1:05:02] is a
[1:05:04] wick look he's got a fire on one end up
[1:05:09] here the other end's dipping into oil
[1:05:12] drawing oil and making fire what a
[1:05:15] church what a power what a place tells
[1:05:18] us to rise and trim of
[1:05:20] lamps 52 patus
[1:05:23] Vision how thrilling it is to think of
[1:05:25] seven lamps drawing life and light from
[1:05:27] the resources of that M bold because
[1:05:30] they had their wits dipped therein each
[1:05:33] Church age messenger is depicted here
[1:05:35] his life is on fire with the Holy Ghost
[1:05:37] his Wick life has been immersed in
[1:05:40] Christ through that Wick he is drawing
[1:05:43] the very Life of Christ and by it gives
[1:05:46] out light to the church what kind of
[1:05:49] light is he giving the very same light
[1:05:51] that was in the first lamp that was lit
[1:05:54] and right on down the ages to the
[1:05:57] present time of the last day messenger
[1:06:00] the same life and the same light is
[1:06:02] manifested Be A Life That's hid with God
[1:06:04] in
[1:06:06] Christ so
[1:06:09] Moses build what you
[1:06:12] saw he built seven golden candlesticks
[1:06:15] or a lamp
[1:06:17] stamp he built it in made
[1:06:20] it and we found that it matches with the
[1:06:24] bows the bug
[1:06:27] the
[1:06:29] lamps all of it
[1:06:32] matches and you say well how do you know
[1:06:34] that's what that is well if you'll go
[1:06:36] home and run it into your encyclopedia
[1:06:38] and just run in manora whatever how you
[1:06:41] pronounce it but make sure you do not
[1:06:44] like I did it is m n o r a h but it
[1:06:49] pronounced monora which is ma but run in
[1:06:53] me you r teach right don't be a dummy
[1:06:58] like me it took me a while to figure
[1:07:00] that one out cuz I couldn't find it in
[1:07:03] the
[1:07:04] dictionary why cuz I look in the wrong
[1:07:07] place but
[1:07:09] look what Moses
[1:07:13] saw Zachariah can't be any
[1:07:19] different the only thing Zachariah is
[1:07:22] telling you that it's the word of the
[1:07:24] Lord down through seven Church
[1:07:26] right
[1:07:27] am the Book of Revelations is showing
[1:07:30] you that word down through seven Church
[1:07:32] ages we read there where the Prophet
[1:07:34] said the word to come because when that
[1:07:36] was showed to John the seven Church ages
[1:07:38] had not come into being
[1:07:40] yet it's the word of God in The Bride of
[1:07:43] Jesus Christ the one little key is is
[1:07:46] the wick of your life right this of
[1:07:50] mine I'm
[1:07:52] going right right got have Wick to run
[1:07:56] down through there Moses didn't tell
[1:07:58] them that I guess he figured that they
[1:08:02] had enough sense to be able to know it
[1:08:05] the actual Wicks back in those days were
[1:08:08] made out of
[1:08:09] wool CU wool is the best Wick you can
[1:08:12] make piece of wool
[1:08:15] cloth we used to take those old lamps
[1:08:17] and those things and have to turn them
[1:08:19] up and cuz even after we had electric
[1:08:22] lights and we were living in a house
[1:08:24] that finally one day about 46 had
[1:08:27] electric lights and to get up your SK
[1:08:29] your lessons you had to light the lamp
[1:08:31] because it was 25 wat bug sticking up in
[1:08:34] a 12T ceiling now you figure how much
[1:08:37] light you got out of that so you'll know
[1:08:40] we had to still these used lamps up
[1:08:42] until the way on up into the 50s because
[1:08:45] you couldn't do it and we finally
[1:08:47] learned how to run the L the light down
[1:08:50] and extend the wire till we got it down
[1:08:52] the head high and it still didn't do
[1:08:53] much good yeah but listen
[1:08:58] folks Zachariah them saw God in seven
[1:09:01] Church CH amen it's all the lamps that
[1:09:04] would bring up the oil cuz that lamp is
[1:09:07] no good without a wit that runs all the
[1:09:09] way
[1:09:09] down you let that Wick get burned out
[1:09:12] you got to do something for it that's
[1:09:15] right you got to keep putting that
[1:09:17] fixing that Wick so I assume probably in
[1:09:20] those days which is that's what we done
[1:09:22] how many of you ever done this we'd take
[1:09:24] the wick and roll up in the bottom of
[1:09:26] the bowl and pour oil on it and then it
[1:09:29] would stay in there and then you just
[1:09:31] kept turning a little knob that brought
[1:09:33] it up and as you did it would burn for
[1:09:36] sometimes a year before you had to
[1:09:38] replace that Wick that was in there amen
[1:09:41] and I even studied this there were only
[1:09:43] like three of those lamps that were in
[1:09:45] the the holy I mean in the um what is it
[1:09:49] called not called the holy of holies um
[1:09:51] the the outer court but it's got another
[1:09:54] word for it Court inner court all right
[1:09:57] and in that inner Court every one of
[1:09:59] them didn't
[1:10:00] burn you'll find if you'll study it that
[1:10:03] over there that U uh one of them David
[1:10:06] or one of them had 10
[1:10:10] candlesticks you know it's there but all
[1:10:14] that speaks of being you right
[1:10:18] yeah your life dipped in the Holy Ghost
[1:10:22] and let your light shine that's it right
[1:10:24] there because without that Wick up at
[1:10:26] the top of that all that's down under
[1:10:28] there is worth nothing right right
[1:10:31] am it's Christ in the seven Church ages
[1:10:35] that he's trying to show so Zachariah
[1:10:38] saw what Moses
[1:10:44] made and God said but Zachariah it is
[1:10:48] not just a Candlestick a l stand right
[1:10:53] it is showing that in the future age is
[1:10:55] to come it's going to be not by my my
[1:10:58] not by power but by my spirit it's going
[1:11:01] to be the holy spirit in seven Church
[1:11:03] ages am it's going to be the life of God
[1:11:05] and John saw it as the son of man
[1:11:07] standing in the midst of the seven
[1:11:08] golden
[1:11:11] Candlestick you and I are that lamp
[1:11:14] folks that little Wick that's right
[1:11:17] without that Wick I am the
[1:11:20] vine you are the branches Hallelujah the
[1:11:24] Vine doesn't
[1:11:26] Bear
[1:11:28] right branches it's the branches that
[1:11:32] bear the vine runs the life up to where
[1:11:35] the branches are at go out and if Jacob
[1:11:39] was here he can give you a good lesson
[1:11:40] on how to prune a a grap Vine right you
[1:11:44] got to prune that thing back to where
[1:11:46] when he puts out a new V there's where
[1:11:48] your grapes come from
[1:11:51] right but you see folks we're that Weck
[1:11:54] your prophit are we read it where he
[1:11:56] said a
[1:12:00] Believer you're the one that's supposed
[1:12:02] to be letting the light
[1:12:06] shine you're the ones let be letting the
[1:12:08] gospel
[1:12:12] shine okay but brother daylight it says
[1:12:14] over there in zachi there was was two
[1:12:16] olive trees and we'll get back to
[1:12:21] that but you see it's Christ reveal down
[1:12:25] through seven Church
[1:12:29] ages the light of the
[1:12:31] gospel and without
[1:12:33] you God don't have no light to shine
[1:12:37] right you he can do what he wants to he
[1:12:40] can't break his word that's right and
[1:12:42] he's done said you are the I'm the vine
[1:12:45] you're the branches
[1:12:49] right he said it's not by power not by
[1:12:52] might but by my spirit
[1:12:56] right you're going to see me in those
[1:12:59] gandle those candle lamp stand you
[1:13:02] remember why the prophet said lamp stand
[1:13:04] cuz candles just burn out and they're
[1:13:07] gone amen so it's not something sticking
[1:13:09] up in the candle Pro in the end of it
[1:13:10] you go in there every once while change
[1:13:11] a
[1:13:12] candle
[1:13:14] no if you kept that thing running
[1:13:16] correctly and they did they kept three
[1:13:18] of them I read there they kept three of
[1:13:20] them running in that even in the daytime
[1:13:22] but most of them they put them out in
[1:13:24] the daytime
[1:13:31] I wonder sometimes as our lamp one
[1:13:37] out you said well brother
[1:13:40] Dale you told us one let's read
[1:13:44] it then we'll
[1:13:50] quit you said that Prophet was very
[1:13:52] smart he was
[1:13:56] the message of the live story 1951
[1:14:01] 4:15 he said I remember when we used to
[1:14:03] have a 2 gallon can of coal oil we burn
[1:14:06] coal oil lights you've done that haven't
[1:14:09] you many of you burn the coil oil light
[1:14:13] did you ever get to a place where you
[1:14:15] didn't have enough oil for the wick to
[1:14:18] reach in
[1:14:22] there pour water in it
[1:14:25] and let it get up
[1:14:32] there kerosene will float on the top
[1:14:35] right or cold oil will float on the top
[1:14:37] of the
[1:14:38] water you said well what's that got to
[1:14:40] do with
[1:14:44] it I thought we were Washed by the Water
[1:14:46] of the work that's
[1:14:48] right amen I thought that was what we
[1:14:51] were washed by I thought the scripture
[1:14:54] says you're washed by the water of the
[1:14:57] world oh I I want it
[1:15:01] all now what about your
[1:15:04] life cuz that's what I just got through
[1:15:07] trying to explain the Holy Ghost is the
[1:15:10] oil that was in the lamb but the wick is
[1:15:14] you
[1:15:16] right and he has to add the washing of
[1:15:19] the water of the word
[1:15:22] right and keep us clean
[1:15:28] what do you think about it
[1:15:31] Moses I think you really saw
[1:15:39] something well there's two olive
[1:15:44] trees I'll give it to you your Prophet
[1:15:47] said it's the old and the New
[1:15:51] Testament then he said it was Moses
[1:15:58] Elijah well I'll give you a little bit
[1:16:01] where it won't be too long
[1:16:04] and see in Zechariah you see one
[1:16:08] lampstand in Revelations you see two
[1:16:13] right brother Brandon said there's seven
[1:16:16] Church ages in the Old Testament that's
[1:16:19] right and there's seven in the
[1:16:21] new so when John sees a Elijah and
[1:16:26] Moses after the Rapture in Revelations
[1:16:30] 11 he sees the bride of Christ as one
[1:16:33] Candlestick lampstand and he sees Israel
[1:16:36] as the other
[1:16:41] lampstand your Bible's
[1:16:46] right don't have to be changed it has to
[1:16:48] just
[1:16:50] wait till the day in Time come on right
[1:16:55] but is your Wick dipped into the Holy
[1:17:01] Ghost see a lot of our problems a lot of
[1:17:04] times is we keep adding too much water
[1:17:06] until we run the oil out of the
[1:17:10] lamp and that may be what is speaking of
[1:17:13] in there in the parable of the foolish
[1:17:15] virgins where it says our lamps are gone
[1:17:18] out the Bible says our lamps are going
[1:17:21] out
[1:17:26] you know they had a little
[1:17:27] something the foolish virgins had a
[1:17:30] little
[1:17:31] oil they had a lamp and the wick they
[1:17:34] had
[1:17:35] everything they just didn't have enough
[1:17:39] oil if fact just kept pouring water in
[1:17:41] there trying to get to raise up it
[1:17:42] finally run out until it starts
[1:17:46] sputtering
[1:17:49] work foolish
[1:17:51] virgin she's got a certain amount of
[1:17:53] word all
[1:17:55] and the Holy Ghost can use
[1:17:57] her but it'll eventually burn
[1:18:00] out but the bride she brought oil with
[1:18:03] her in her
[1:18:06] lamp the Holy Ghost in our
[1:18:09] lives but let that Wick let it live out
[1:18:12] to other people let them see your
[1:18:15] life if you want to win somebody to this
[1:18:17] message it's not quoting them to death
[1:18:19] right not trying to tell them how bad
[1:18:22] they are and how sorry they are and what
[1:18:23] they need to do he showing him Jesus
[1:18:28] Christ a wick of
[1:18:30] Life a
[1:18:32] Believer who's anchored in that Holy
[1:18:38] Ghost
[1:18:40] right take on these things let's stand
