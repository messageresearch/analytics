[18:34] take care of him and
[18:35] all of the people as we read your word
[18:37] you come on the scene
[18:39] and manifest yourself in a mighty way to
[18:41] each and every one we love you
[18:43] and we thank you in jesus name amen
[18:47] all right let's start reading about what
[18:50] we got
[18:52] 16 we'll read
[18:55] this and then going into the four four
[18:57] go from three into four
[18:59] where you get the whole story all right
[19:01] so we start
[19:02] in about
[19:06] 50 let's start the 15. brother and i
[19:08] speak after the manner of men
[19:10] though if it be but a man's covenant yet
[19:12] if it is
[19:13] confirmed no man disannounced or added
[19:16] there unto
[19:17] now to abraham and his seed were the
[19:21] promises made notice one seed not
[19:23] seeds not plural just one seed
[19:27] and that seed is jesus christ we know
[19:29] that
[19:30] he saith not enter seeds as of many but
[19:33] as a one
[19:34] and are thy seed which is christ and
[19:36] this i say
[19:38] that the covenant that was confirmed
[19:40] before of god
[19:41] in christ the law which was 430 years
[19:45] after cannot discipline
[19:47] null that it should make the promises of
[19:50] non-effect because see the law was
[19:53] was spiritual we needed it it had to be
[19:56] brought in to
[19:57] to come to the bases but then now you're
[20:00] going to see heresy that you're going to
[20:02] pick up something
[20:03] under the law well maybe the right way
[20:08] to say something but
[20:09] we'll pick up a positional understanding
[20:12] under the law of the spiritual that is
[20:15] to come to pass
[20:17] and then that way you'll be able to
[20:20] follow in
[20:21] the doing for if the inheritance be of
[20:24] the law it is no more promise
[20:27] but god gave it to abraham by promise
[20:30] now remember what we had
[20:31] and i keep dropping back into the
[20:34] previous messages
[20:35] remember why god chose abraham
[20:38] remember why that happened that way you
[20:41] remember the
[20:42] the messages we tried to preach that he
[20:44] wasn't a special guy with it
[20:46] but he loved god and god looked down at
[20:50] a man and said now that's the man i want
[20:54] because he loved god no matter what god
[20:56] done he still loved god
[20:59] so then remember your your choosing is
[21:01] on the basis of maybe
[21:03] something you do have in life because he
[21:06] can look at you
[21:07] we'll get to that later in the message
[21:09] he can look at you and see if whether or
[21:11] not he
[21:13] loves you but he loved abraham
[21:17] he loved david he loved those great men
[21:20] but it was because they all loved him
[21:24] and had their heart set on him so don't
[21:26] forget those things
[21:28] all right wherefore then serveth the law
[21:32] in other words was the law it was added
[21:35] because of transgressions
[21:37] till the seed should come to whom the
[21:39] promise was made
[21:41] and it was ordained by angels in the
[21:44] hand of a mediator
[21:46] now mediator is not a mediator of one
[21:49] but god is one
[21:51] is the law then against the promises of
[21:54] god
[21:55] god forbid for if there had been
[21:58] had there had been a law given which
[22:01] could have given
[22:02] life verily righteousness should have
[22:04] come by the law
[22:05] but the scripture has concluded all
[22:08] under sin
[22:10] that the promise now that's jew or
[22:12] gentile don't make no difference we're
[22:13] all under sin
[22:15] yeah all right
[22:18] that we prom that the promise
[22:22] by faith of jesus christ might give unto
[22:25] them that
[22:26] believe now remember what it was with
[22:28] abraham he believed god and it was
[22:30] imputed unto him for righteousness
[22:32] but before faith came we were kept
[22:36] under the law in other words were kept
[22:39] by
[22:40] book of rules it was a book of rules the
[22:42] law was
[22:43] don't do this don't do that it was a
[22:46] book of rules
[22:47] then we were kept under that shut up
[22:51] unto the faith which should afterwards
[22:53] be revealed
[22:56] now watch him wherefore the law
[22:59] was our school master
[23:03] to bring us unto christ that we might be
[23:07] justified by faith now
[23:08] the law was a school master
[23:13] it's very important what is the school
[23:16] master
[23:17] somebody teaches you the the you know
[23:19] algebra
[23:20] science or whatever math schoolmaster
[23:24] all right so then think about it
[23:27] wherefore the law was our teacher
[23:32] our director our controller
[23:36] uh what all could you put with it
[23:40] for what forth to bring us unto christ
[23:43] that we might be justified by faith
[23:47] but after that faith has come we're no
[23:49] longer
[23:51] under a schoolmaster
[23:55] the law came to last until jesus christ
[24:01] then when christ came christ being the
[24:04] end
[24:04] of the law for righteousness to them
[24:07] that believe
[24:09] so when christ came he was a fulfillment
[24:11] of the law he was the law
[24:12] made manifest in an alive word
[24:15] we'll get down to some of those things
[24:17] later on all right
[24:19] for year all the children now what
[24:23] of god by faith in christ jesus for as
[24:26] many
[24:26] of you as have been baptized into christ
[24:29] have put on christ
[24:32] therefore it is neither jew nor greek
[24:36] there is neither jew nor greek there is
[24:39] neither bond nor free
[24:40] there is neither male nor female for
[24:43] you're all
[24:44] one in christ jesus now what about
[24:48] paul's taking the whole law of all
[24:51] before him
[24:52] all the things and he's bringing it down
[24:55] to a situation
[24:57] to showing you how gracious the law is
[25:00] and why we needed it all right now
[25:04] for if we be christ for if ye be christ
[25:07] in your
[25:07] abraham's seed and ours according to the
[25:10] promise now watch him
[25:13] now i say that the heir as long as he is
[25:16] a child
[25:17] differs nothing from a servant though he
[25:20] be lord of all
[25:21] now paul
[25:26] you made that personal you said now i
[25:28] say
[25:33] he made it personal it was something
[25:36] real to him he knew what he was talking
[25:37] about right
[25:39] now come on now i say
[25:42] that there is
[25:46] error as long as he is a child differs
[25:49] nothing
[25:50] from a servant though he be lord of all
[25:55] now what something's got to come on the
[25:57] scene but it's under
[25:58] tutors schoolmasters
[26:02] same word look it up and governors
[26:07] this is up and downs of what the
[26:08] schoolmaster really is
[26:10] until a time appointed of the father
[26:13] even so
[26:14] we when we were children were in bondage
[26:17] under the elements of the world
[26:19] but when the fullness of time was come
[26:21] god sent forth
[26:23] his son made of a woman made under the
[26:26] law
[26:26] to redeem them that were under the law
[26:29] that we might receive the adoption of
[26:32] sons
[26:34] and because ye our sons god hath sent
[26:37] forth the spirit of his son into your
[26:40] hearts crying out by
[26:41] father for for thou art no more a
[26:44] servant
[26:47] no watch but a son and if a son then an
[26:50] hour of god
[26:52] through christ you may be seated lord
[26:55] add his blessing to the word
[26:57] think on these things you can just keep
[26:59] reading the word of god
[27:01] get your mind in a channel and see that
[27:04] you can go from one
[27:05] chapter to the next chapter to the next
[27:07] chapter
[27:08] in understanding and doing
[27:11] and following it now paul
[27:15] being a great scholar that he was
[27:18] you don't see you see peter explaining
[27:21] after paul
[27:22] brings forth the things you see peter
[27:25] bringing forth
[27:27] things that fit therein and the prophet
[27:29] said
[27:30] peter and paul said the same thing they
[27:31] were not different in doctrine
[27:34] they taught the same thing all right now
[27:37] but see paul he takes the old testament
[27:42] and he's looking at the old testament
[27:44] he's seeing
[27:46] that here was man
[27:51] coming into the world
[27:54] you know natural man natural people and
[27:57] walking
[27:58] in the best that they could do and it
[28:00] looks like that
[28:02] you know that god says well now that
[28:05] that ain't good enough i'll have to give
[28:06] him something to do
[28:08] so he gives the law no
[28:12] the law was asked for by mankind
[28:17] right mankind asked for the law he
[28:21] sought the law
[28:22] because it's just like he sought a king
[28:27] i mean the people did paul knows these
[28:31] stories they
[28:32] sought a king to be ruler over them
[28:35] which was never to be right
[28:38] they sought a law in the basis of saying
[28:42] give us something to do
[28:49] well god gives mankind the law
[28:53] but here's the problem
[28:56] the bible says the law is spiritual
[29:01] paul speaking but i'm i'm carnal
[29:05] i mean the law is the word of god
[29:09] amen see they made the law a book of
[29:12] rules it's not a book of rules
[29:17] you say yes it is because it tells you
[29:19] thou shalt not steal thou shalt not kill
[29:21] thy shall not do it
[29:23] but mankind made it that right
[29:27] it is not that the prophet said the the
[29:30] ten commandments
[29:32] was the seals of the old testament
[29:36] and palsy said it the law is spiritual
[29:41] the law was the word of god
[29:46] man made it a book of rules it was never
[29:49] to have been a book of rules it was
[29:50] never
[29:51] to have been thou shalt not kill thy
[29:53] shalt not steal you're reading it
[29:54] differently brother gary atkins used to
[29:56] say it that way it
[29:57] it sounds different if you read it
[29:59] different you know and you read where it
[30:01] says
[30:02] thou shalt not steal
[30:05] well see that's the great ten
[30:07] commandments form of
[30:10] on the mountain and the writing of the
[30:12] commandments and the things you know
[30:13] a great human voice you know thundering
[30:17] out and
[30:19] see you read it like that you read thy
[30:21] shall not kill
[30:24] i shall not steal
[30:29] but read it a little different read it
[30:32] thou shalt not kill
[30:33] right that shall not steal
[30:37] he said well you said the same thing the
[30:40] wording is the same but the meaning
[30:42] behind it is not the same
[30:46] right then you begin to find out what
[30:49] the
[30:50] the law and what it was made for and
[30:53] paul was bringing it out to the
[30:55] galatians
[30:58] and showing them that we were under
[31:02] school masters
[31:03] teachers all right the law became our
[31:07] school master
[31:10] paul said i wouldn't have known unless i
[31:12] did i wouldn't have known sin if it
[31:13] hadn't been for sin thou shalt not lust
[31:15] or et cetera see
[31:20] you know you get started on something
[31:22] and then you say well i can't
[31:23] i get on that i got to go somewhere else
[31:25] so because
[31:26] see the law is the word of god
[31:32] it's not a book of rules that's right
[31:34] man
[31:35] made it the book of rules because that's
[31:36] what he wanted
[31:39] his biggest mistake in exodus what is it
[31:42] 19 is that what it is
[31:44] it's an exodus where man chose law
[31:49] and i illustrated it like see they chose
[31:51] a king
[31:54] they chose a king see it was never god's
[31:57] intentions to give them a king
[32:00] it was not god's intentions to give a
[32:02] law
[32:06] the prophet was all they needed
[32:13] if they'd have just listened
[32:16] all right but you see then you take it
[32:20] and you take adoption and you try to
[32:22] bring in adoption because
[32:24] that was what paul used in the the
[32:26] galatians
[32:29] all right now brother bob the other
[32:31] night done
[32:32] a good point of brain it i'd always made
[32:34] that statement but i just never did
[32:36] uh go back and prove because i thought
[32:38] it was just uh you know
[32:41] a normal thing that people understood
[32:44] that because that's what we understood
[32:45] and i was in the baptist church
[32:47] we understood that uh you know
[32:51] adoption was the thing that was brought
[32:54] over from the
[32:55] gentile situation are really the romans
[33:00] and brought into the situation of of uh
[33:04] you know being part of their rules and
[33:06] regulations
[33:07] but it was not an original adopting
[33:11] uh thing it was not original from it the
[33:13] jews didn't take it to the romans
[33:15] the romans brought it to the to the jews
[33:18] and it became in
[33:19] in bread into their uh
[33:23] teachings and doings because when you
[33:25] would go into bondage to a king of
[33:27] another country
[33:28] then he would teach you his laws his
[33:30] rules his regulations
[33:33] and you would wind up a lot of times
[33:34] even if you went free from that
[33:36] king you don't wind up taking some of
[33:38] that with you
[33:39] because you had it for hundreds of years
[33:41] and it was okay
[33:44] see now what's my point because i'm just
[33:47] i'm just
[33:48] plain of saying it see had not
[33:51] this been brought from the romans you
[33:54] would not have had
[33:55] adoptional teachings into the
[33:59] israeli or israel
[34:03] so thank god for it
[34:07] but see god didn't give them what they
[34:08] wanted they wanted a book of rules i
[34:11] keep saying that
[34:13] but he didn't give them that he gave
[34:15] them his word
[34:18] thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal
[34:22] brother branham picked it up and brought
[34:23] it to exactly placing it with the seals
[34:29] in his message with the seals is not a
[34:32] book of rules
[34:34] what is the seals it's a revelation of
[34:36] jesus christ
[34:38] so what was the law under the old
[34:40] testament a revelation
[34:42] of what god would come forth into
[34:45] making himself one day to be a man to
[34:48] walk on this earth
[34:50] right because everything he dealt with
[34:53] in the
[34:54] in the ten commandments is dealing with
[34:57] something about jesus christ if you
[34:59] place it correctly
[35:02] i remember years ago i was studying on
[35:04] marriage and divorce or something
[35:05] and i got in it in my thoughts i got
[35:08] connected
[35:09] into the right channel of understanding
[35:11] and i could see those
[35:13] uh those ten commandments this is
[35:15] beautiful
[35:17] and see how it come right down to where
[35:19] we're at now
[35:22] see then paul would say the law is
[35:23] spiritual
[35:26] in other words the law was right they
[35:30] just took it wrong
[35:33] he said they didn't get what they
[35:34] thought they got
[35:37] they got a revelation of jesus christ in
[35:39] letter form
[35:41] called the ten commandments you know
[35:43] what i just can't do that
[35:45] i can't i can't see the prophet said it
[35:48] i didn't
[35:48] he said if you don't if you read the
[35:51] bible and don't see
[35:52] jesus christ in every verse of the bible
[35:55] go back and read it again you missed
[35:58] something right
[36:02] now that's pretty strong but it's true
[36:05] because the bible is to bring forth
[36:07] god to us or to reveal god to make
[36:10] himself known that was his purpose and
[36:12] doings and
[36:13] and what took place and why he would
[36:16] come down through that and do these
[36:17] things
[36:20] and even give the people things that
[36:23] that he knew that was going to kill them
[36:27] but that's what they wanted see they
[36:30] wanted a king
[36:34] samuel said if i ever told you anything
[36:36] was wrong have i ever done anything
[36:38] no we just want a king we'll be like the
[36:40] rest
[36:42] well that was the biggest mistake they
[36:45] could make
[36:46] between the fact of choosing a king and
[36:49] choosing a law
[36:50] the way they got it the way they thought
[36:53] it was
[36:54] was the most damaging effect that
[36:56] anything could ever had upon mankind
[36:58] it left mankind or made
[37:02] mankind a sinner you know sin wasn't
[37:06] imputed where there was no transgression
[37:07] of the law
[37:08] in other words backing up into there
[37:10] there was a time that sin was not
[37:12] imputed
[37:15] well yeah it computed after the adam's
[37:17] transgression yeah
[37:19] but not it's not like it is now it
[37:23] it was the fact you see those things in
[37:26] a beautiful picture if you see jesus
[37:28] christ in that verse instead of seeing
[37:30] everything else
[37:33] all right so then what we're doing we're
[37:36] taking galatians to
[37:38] see that paul is picking
[37:42] this up from the old testament teachings
[37:47] you know he's picking up the law he's
[37:50] bringing it in he's picking up that the
[37:52] law is a schoolmaster
[37:54] to bring us to christ he's still telling
[37:57] us that the law winds up being our tutor
[38:01] our governor which was appointed to
[38:05] us to raise us
[38:10] all right now but the romans they picked
[38:13] that up i mean the jews picked it up
[38:15] from the romans
[38:16] and bringing it on into
[38:19] this point and paul would be the one to
[38:22] go back over here
[38:23] and bring all of this out and show us
[38:25] this was
[38:26] the revelation of jesus christ
[38:33] the law was a revelation of jesus christ
[38:38] and seeing those things now what's my
[38:40] point i wanna i wanna i wanna throw you
[38:42] a curve
[38:45] i believe in teach and i believe the
[38:46] prophet did and i believe paul did i
[38:48] mean peter did
[38:49] i'm just saying it that way but i i'm
[38:51] going to tell you i believe it
[38:53] i believe in there's three stages of
[38:55] grace
[38:56] not steps of grace now you don't have
[38:58] that stages and steps is different
[39:01] just don't try to make it and because
[39:03] you can't take
[39:05] the first church age and lay it with the
[39:07] first seal
[39:12] you can't you can compare
[39:16] but you cannot put them totally parallel
[39:19] because you'd wind up in bad shape
[39:23] maybe that don't click to you but it
[39:25] clicks in me to understand one thing
[39:30] god spent all of that time trying to
[39:32] bring down to you and i
[39:34] his understanding of himself
[39:40] and sin then to do it he brought it in
[39:43] because let me ask it this way
[39:46] i don't mean just to raise your hand i
[39:48] don't do it because you get yourself in
[39:50] trouble with your own thoughts
[39:52] just be right what do you believe about
[39:54] adoption a lot of people have never
[39:56] heard about adoption they've never heard
[39:58] it taught they don't know what adoption
[40:00] is
[40:01] and that's what's so funny that we
[40:02] taught adoption in the baptist church
[40:06] and i knew in the baptist church that
[40:09] the romans brought over
[40:11] that we we took that when israel was
[40:15] captivated by the romans and the people
[40:18] they took those things and brought them
[40:19] into their daily routines and their
[40:21] doings and
[40:22] and things of of life right brother bob
[40:26] he run the whole thing through for you
[40:28] so that was good
[40:30] all right we see we knew that then
[40:33] wha wha what went wrong with the people
[40:35] of this message that said we don't
[40:37] understand adoption
[40:41] well you know maybe you just never read
[40:42] the book
[40:46] right maybe you never read the bible
[40:52] and thought about it i mean
[40:57] see they picked up those things
[41:01] and from the roman government and people
[41:05] and they called it a schoolmaster
[41:08] that's what paul would pick up in
[41:09] galatians because he knew what that was
[41:13] he knew what those things was that's why
[41:15] he would call it a tutor a tutor is a
[41:17] razor
[41:18] and and we know the story are supposed
[41:20] to of of adoption that
[41:21] a child born into the family you know
[41:23] he's a child at birth
[41:25] but yet he's given a tutor a razor
[41:28] to raise him to bring him to a position
[41:31] that he can come to a situation to where
[41:33] god can say
[41:34] this is my son in whom i'm pleased to
[41:37] dwell
[41:40] right and seeing that jesus christ went
[41:42] through the exact
[41:43] example of of this adoption but jesus
[41:48] went with three stages
[41:55] then you think jesus taught three stages
[41:59] of adoption
[42:03] we babbed just talked two stages i
[42:06] wonder what the message people's
[42:08] teaching
[42:09] well we don't even fool with that
[42:10] because we don't know yeah that's the
[42:14] truth
[42:20] see if i ask you
[42:23] to express the three stages of grace
[42:32] you could probably remember it from a
[42:33] tape you heard or from this that or the
[42:35] other or
[42:36] thoughts and ideas talked of all right
[42:39] that's good that's all right
[42:42] but really do you understand it
[42:52] do you understand that there's three
[42:54] stages
[42:57] but yet those natural romans
[43:00] never taught the third stage
[43:09] the natural jew
[43:13] even though he knew of those stages and
[43:16] what was going on
[43:17] he never taught the third stage
[43:20] of adoption
[43:25] but it might be interesting to find out
[43:26] the third stage well i know what it is
[43:29] it's the redemption of the body amen all
[43:31] right we're good
[43:36] but where's your example there's no
[43:37] example in the old testament because
[43:39] there's no death burial resurrection
[43:41] to be counted in the old testament sure
[43:43] there was people raised from the dead
[43:44] right we will bring that
[43:48] there was people raising the dead in the
[43:49] old testament but there was not a
[43:50] resurrection in the old testament
[43:56] maybe that's why you had the pharisees
[43:57] and sadducees of the trouble do you know
[43:59] what the difference between a pharisee
[44:00] and a sadducee
[44:03] i mean do you really know the difference
[44:05] between a pharisee and a sadducee
[44:07] that was two groups that was all that
[44:09] paul was fighting against pharisees
[44:10] sadducees
[44:11] had a little problem with the herodians
[44:13] in a different little situation
[44:14] but it was mainly pharisees and
[44:16] sadducees
[44:18] you know the difference in the pharisees
[44:19] the sadducees
[44:21] pharisee believes in a resurrection
[44:30] a sadducee doesn't believe in the
[44:32] resurrection
[44:34] hold on
[44:38] that's what i'm talking i'm standing
[44:39] here talking about somewhere in the
[44:41] 58 59 60
[44:45] in the baptist church that i knew thing
[44:48] because you could study the word god
[44:53] that's why the pharisees and sadducees
[44:55] were constantly after each other
[44:56] now the sadducees it wasn't they didn't
[44:59] believe in the resurrection
[45:01] they didn't believe in the resurrection
[45:02] the way the pharisees believed it
[45:08] the sadducees believed that there would
[45:09] be a final resurrection
[45:17] but the pharisees they believed that it
[45:18] was our working through some way that
[45:21] they could not explain it because it was
[45:23] something
[45:24] they had picked up and was guided about
[45:26] in their doings
[45:27] but they couldn't put it together enough
[45:29] to say
[45:32] but they argued over it go back and read
[45:35] your bible
[45:37] the sadducees argued about the fact that
[45:39] there would be a resurrection but you
[45:41] believed
[45:44] you never noticed where mary was yes
[45:46] lord we know in the resurrection
[45:51] the everybody looked for a resurrection
[45:55] but the resurrection was looked at after
[45:57] being like job
[46:04] job believed in a resurrection
[46:11] i know that my lord liveth
[46:15] in one day
[46:19] but see what did job need he needed a
[46:22] personal experience
[46:24] with somebody you ever heard the prophet
[46:26] say it this way he said he
[46:28] always wanted the fact of saying that he
[46:30] could take some man
[46:31] that would reach over here and get
[46:33] almighty god and reach over here and get
[46:35] him
[46:36] and bring them together and make them
[46:38] one
[46:40] well that's exactly what the lord jesus
[46:42] went up doing
[46:44] right he took god and man and put it
[46:47] together through the new birth and
[46:48] brought it
[46:49] amen see job
[46:55] was looking for a resurrection i know my
[46:57] redeemer liveth
[47:03] but when god got through with job job
[47:05] wasn't saying i know
[47:06] because that that's a odd word see you
[47:10] say i know well that could just be you
[47:11] you've got a good thoughts you got a
[47:13] good idea no get
[47:15] look it up that word says no there means
[47:18] i have an experience
[47:20] or a situation of this in my own life
[47:25] job knew
[47:30] that there was going to be a
[47:31] resurrection of a man
[47:33] but he couldn't explain it how could he
[47:36] there was no way to explain it but he
[47:38] said i know my redeemer liveth
[47:40] amen in the last days not in the
[47:43] resurrection
[47:45] he was looking for something some of
[47:48] those people were spiritual enough to
[47:50] find out that they needed to look for a
[47:52] resurrection there
[47:54] what good is the resurrection tomorrow
[47:56] the next day
[48:00] get something personal
[48:05] and look at it and see
[48:09] see job could get the idea and come up
[48:11] he could talk about
[48:12] with it a little bit in the basis of the
[48:15] third stage of
[48:16] redemption or adoption
[48:20] interchangeable words
[48:26] he said what are you trying to get us to
[48:28] see brother dale
[48:29] i'm trying to get me and you to see one
[48:31] thing do we understand
[48:36] can we put it in the message can we put
[48:39] it in the bible
[48:41] can we put what we talk about in the
[48:42] bible
[48:46] and the baptist come along preach job in
[48:48] the resurrection
[48:52] well i don't know about this
[48:53] resurrection this is this adoptions and
[48:56] things that just
[48:56] that's beyond me that's too deep for me
[49:02] it is where you've been reading your
[49:05] bible that's right
[49:10] shoot real fast why don't you take
[49:12] galatians and let paul
[49:14] line up now if you don't get nothing to
[49:16] message today get this little point
[49:19] let paul line up with those old
[49:22] testament saints
[49:24] now the jews knowing that they come from
[49:27] the romans with their idea of adoption
[49:32] and he's dealing with them on some on
[49:34] something they can understand
[49:40] so he goes through the galatians
[49:46] and he explains the tutor the governors
[49:50] the schoolmasters we'll get this if we
[49:53] don't we'll get in another message
[49:55] somewhere down the road i've got plenty
[49:56] to preach on anyway
[49:59] but you see paul was explaining to those
[50:03] natural jews
[50:05] you have tucked this you know
[50:08] they couldn't argue with him because
[50:09] they knew he knew what he talked about
[50:11] you've taken this from the
[50:12] romans and they're right
[50:15] they're supposed to be a fact in the
[50:18] doctrinal
[50:19] issue that a child is a child when it
[50:21] was born into the family
[50:24] and then adoption was when the child was
[50:26] tutored or trained and brought to a
[50:28] position
[50:29] and adopted all right
[50:34] now that's as far as paul goes
[50:37] with galatians
[50:40] because that's two stages whether he
[50:44] didn't know
[50:45] or whether god kept him from preaching i
[50:47] don't know because i know in
[50:48] romans i can prove he did he knew in
[50:50] three or three
[50:52] all stages but that's what i'm getting
[50:56] at
[50:58] what are you
[51:04] paul was saying okay we're under these
[51:06] things
[51:07] you you galatians you desire to be under
[51:09] the law
[51:15] you need to stay spiritual instead of
[51:17] wanting to go back under
[51:18] see these galatians had got brought over
[51:21] from the law
[51:23] into the revelation or time frame of the
[51:26] new testament situation
[51:28] and it was beginning to understand and
[51:31] paul is explaining
[51:33] to them the situation of what had
[51:35] happened
[51:39] he was not concerned with explaining the
[51:41] resurrection
[51:44] his concern was to explain the new birth
[51:49] and then the point going with the new
[51:51] birth to bring you into adoption
[51:54] authorities and things because we'll
[51:57] prove it as we go along if we have to
[51:59] just keep taking message after message
[52:01] but seeing the romans you'll find
[52:04] the identification of of a christian
[52:08] amen romans 1 i mean romans
[52:12] 8 but then he goes from
[52:17] identification brought into the family
[52:22] he goes to the authority second stage
[52:27] authority of bringing the child up
[52:31] through tutors and trainers and raisers
[52:33] and governors
[52:34] now you see what he's doing back here to
[52:37] the galatians
[52:39] but see paul takes romans to the next
[52:44] stage
[52:47] and see you you've got to hold romans to
[52:49] be your finality of all things
[52:51] because even peter in his teachings of
[52:54] the stature of a perfect man
[52:56] which was wonderful and marvelous to
[52:58] bring forth the stages of
[52:59] adoption but it never took the stages of
[53:02] adoption to the redemption of the body
[53:06] peter never took it to there
[53:10] paul was the only one taking it fully
[53:12] into the full redemption
[53:15] the others could came forth and you know
[53:16] and do
[53:19] he said well i don't understand
[53:24] you know why don't you understand what
[53:27] is it you don't understand
[53:32] it's right in the word of god paul takes
[53:35] the galatians and carries them through
[53:37] stage one and stage two
[53:41] puts the tutors the governors the
[53:42] trainers the school masters all of those
[53:44] things
[53:45] into the the child because under the old
[53:48] roman part the child was born into the
[53:50] family
[53:52] when the jews picked it up and brought
[53:54] it on into their understanding a child
[53:56] would be born into the family
[53:58] i was a dale when i was born into the
[54:00] family i didn't have to join it i didn't
[54:02] have to do anything to get there
[54:04] i was born into the family of the dales
[54:07] well but then you was to be given tutors
[54:10] and
[54:11] and raisers to bring you up to bring you
[54:13] to the full authority
[54:15] because the second stage will come into
[54:17] manifestation
[54:18] or full authority well they hear
[54:22] him on finality but even jesus when he
[54:25] went to hear
[54:26] him he was still short of one thing
[54:32] oh you're getting too known jesus was
[54:35] still short of the resurrection
[54:39] at that moment he was not bringing it to
[54:41] that
[54:48] the prophet on the statue of a perfect
[54:49] man said thirty-something years
[54:52] i've been preaching this
[54:56] go back through the messages in there
[54:58] hear him and
[54:59] and all of those things and and some of
[55:01] where we've been talking about where
[55:02] pentecost failed and what those things
[55:04] were
[55:05] and all go back and study those things
[55:09] and see if you can find out where you're
[55:12] at
[55:13] right what stage are you in
[55:19] it's got to be three stages that's why
[55:21] it's it's not
[55:22] three steps steps won't work it's stages
[55:25] it's a stage means you can go from this
[55:27] and the same person go to the next stage
[55:29] into the next stage and goes through
[55:32] into your correct order
[55:34] all right what are you following me
[55:39] policy in you galatians you desire to be
[55:42] under the law you want to go
[55:43] back to them things when you didn't even
[55:47] understand
[55:48] it when you was there
[55:52] the law was speaking of the the lord
[55:54] jesus christ to come into being is that
[55:56] true is that what the prophet
[55:58] quoted a moment ago if you don't see
[55:59] christ in every verse or jesus may be
[56:02] you know excuse unless it says christ
[56:04] because he didn't say jesus cause you
[56:05] can't see jesus never verse
[56:07] don't get smart with me you don't see
[56:09] jesus in every verse
[56:11] you know the name jesus the name jesus
[56:13] no but you see christ
[56:17] in every verse of the bible if you don't
[56:18] see it you better get started reading
[56:21] with a little bit understanding about
[56:23] what you're talking about
[56:26] to see christ all right listen
[56:32] even though as i said peter could do
[56:35] such a marvelous job in the statue of a
[56:37] perfect man
[56:39] add to your faith virtual knowledge to
[56:41] impressions come out to love which is
[56:43] the headstone
[56:46] yet when he comes to that still he's
[56:48] missing one thing
[56:53] he's missing the change of the body
[56:58] peter never taught you up to the stage
[57:00] he taught you
[57:01] up to let's see how to say it he never
[57:03] taught you the change of the body he
[57:05] taught you the comp
[57:07] the uh overruling of the body
[57:11] that be a good word for overruling of
[57:13] the body or the rule of the body
[57:15] through the virtues it's the rule this
[57:18] person that we
[57:19] are that's what your virtues are for
[57:24] the statue of a perfect man but brother
[57:27] dale i've just never heard nobody teach
[57:28] well where have you been
[57:36] see that makes you a smart addict
[57:39] all right i'll accept the fact of being
[57:41] an elect but don't cleave me of being
[57:43] smart because i ain't smart
[57:44] if i smart i'd just go sit down in a pew
[57:47] and about 50 years ago i would have sat
[57:49] there and said brother moat you're gonna
[57:51] preach from now on
[57:53] and i did one time i quit preaching
[57:56] some of you my wife knows it some of you
[57:59] the kids may remember that i quit
[58:00] preaching for a while
[58:03] because see i wasn't a preacher i never
[58:04] did count myself as being now so i quit
[58:07] brother mark said what are you going to
[58:08] do
[58:10] i said i'm going to church
[58:13] if i'm going to back you up with
[58:14] everything i can do
[58:16] i'll cut to grace i'll paint the church
[58:18] i'll do all the works
[58:19] i'll do everything in the world and i
[58:21] did
[58:24] but he said what if i get sick i said i
[58:26] believe in praying for the sick
[58:33] but you see the lord put it in a
[58:35] different situation brought it different
[58:36] but
[58:37] that's all right because brother mo told
[58:40] me
[58:41] he's preached statue of a perfect man
[58:43] i'm throwing no reflection to him or
[58:45] what he says or i'm saying
[58:46] i'm just trying i'm telling truth the
[58:48] brother won't finish the statue of a
[58:50] perfect man
[58:51] i ask him one question i ask you that
[58:55] question
[58:56] today
[58:59] how do you get those virtues
[59:09] richard come up to me one day and he
[59:10] said i didn't know it was a commandment
[59:12] or a necessity
[59:13] that we had to get the requirement
[59:16] didn't know it was a requirement for me
[59:17] to get
[59:18] these virtues well that's what they're
[59:19] saying you're required to have them
[59:22] right you see there ain't going to be no
[59:24] change in the body so you're going to be
[59:26] pharisees and sadducees
[59:28] arguing with each other over which one's
[59:30] got the doctrine and neither one of them
[59:31] got it laid out right
[59:35] through the pharisees believe in the
[59:37] resurrection sadducees you read
[59:39] what you do and they'll tell you they
[59:40] didn't believe in the resurrection
[59:44] but it wasn't a resurrection that way it
[59:46] was a resurrection
[59:47] for something happening that the
[59:48] pharisees were getting some idea
[59:50] that something was going to take place
[59:55] they had a little idea when jesus christ
[59:57] rose that they had some thoughts about
[59:59] that
[1:00:00] with the pharisees we don't believe in
[1:00:02] the resurrection
[1:00:06] you say so you bring out stuff like that
[1:00:09] and you drive me crazy cause i don't
[1:00:10] know what you're talking about
[1:00:11] well just listen
[1:00:16] just listen to what i'm talking about if
[1:00:19] you don't know
[1:00:20] ask me a question that's what i'll be
[1:00:21] glad to get back to where we can have
[1:00:22] the questions and answers
[1:00:24] i enjoy questions and answers
[1:00:29] we wouldn't have questions and answered
[1:00:30] every service here if we could handle it
[1:00:34] but we can at least handle it once a
[1:00:35] month where we can get together and
[1:00:38] but i've told you over and over every
[1:00:40] time i preach a series what i do
[1:00:42] questions and answers
[1:00:45] right every time i get through with a
[1:00:47] group of things or messaging what i say
[1:00:49] let's have questions and answers
[1:00:51] i'm open to questions anytime right off
[1:00:53] the pulpits coming floor right off the
[1:00:55] floor
[1:00:56] it doesn't bother me for you to say
[1:00:57] something you say brother dale i don't
[1:00:59] agree with you well praise god now tell
[1:01:01] me why
[1:01:04] maybe that can help me cause you can
[1:01:05] help me to get right
[1:01:07] because if i'm wrong i can listen to you
[1:01:10] don't ever worry about the fact you'll
[1:01:11] hurt this man's feelings
[1:01:14] if you question him what you do is when
[1:01:16] you go among yourselves to talk one
[1:01:18] over to another about what you don't
[1:01:20] agree
[1:01:23] now you've hurt my feelings because you
[1:01:26] owe me
[1:01:29] the point of coming to me
[1:01:33] well brother dale i've tried to now
[1:01:35] don't start that silly stuff
[1:01:37] brother dale i've tried to talk to you
[1:01:39] and you wouldn't talk to me
[1:01:41] i've made one rule around here and that
[1:01:43] one rule i've always stuck with
[1:01:45] and i will stick with that rule
[1:01:49] i cannot go out there after service
[1:01:51] today and stop with one person
[1:01:53] and stay there for an hour before you go
[1:01:56] home
[1:01:58] you say my pastor he just my pastor just
[1:02:01] oh he would just always run up to me
[1:02:02] you've got anything on your mind brother
[1:02:05] let's talk about it well there's the
[1:02:06] rest of the congregation gone
[1:02:11] i'm not gonna do that i got a home you
[1:02:14] got a home we got phones call me up
[1:02:16] we'll sit down talk all week
[1:02:18] amen but when i go outside out there i
[1:02:21] shake hands with everybody i can
[1:02:24] you ain't never noticed that you've
[1:02:25] taught it you put it there and you'll
[1:02:27] see it
[1:02:27] i even shake or do the bumps with the
[1:02:30] kids
[1:02:32] i want everybody to be to realize one
[1:02:34] thing
[1:02:35] we're just a body of jesus christ i am
[1:02:38] nothing
[1:02:40] he said well you're my pastor that's
[1:02:42] what you make me
[1:02:44] come on i got some things on the gifts
[1:02:46] from college where brother random says
[1:02:49] he said the way you treat your pastor is
[1:02:51] the way god will treat you
[1:02:53] well i ain't trying to give me a i you
[1:02:55] know what do you need brother
[1:02:57] i need a new cadillac i could say it and
[1:03:00] get it and don't have to worry about it
[1:03:03] but that ain't what i'm talking about
[1:03:07] i'm talking about there's not one here
[1:03:09] any bigger than anybody else i don't
[1:03:11] care who you
[1:03:11] are how old you are and how much you
[1:03:14] think you know the message you
[1:03:16] ain't no different than anybody else
[1:03:17] that's in this building
[1:03:19] except for one thing if you're right
[1:03:22] about studying the message you got that
[1:03:24] much on your side
[1:03:28] oh okay but you understand
[1:03:34] paul explains
[1:03:39] the old testament relationship
[1:03:43] of adoption
[1:03:46] but he only explains two stages
[1:03:52] peter picks up and gets more into the
[1:03:56] new testament form because he's dealing
[1:03:57] with the spiritual man
[1:03:59] coming forth and telling you how that's
[1:04:01] what i asked brother mold
[1:04:03] i said how do i get these virtues
[1:04:11] that was my question that's my question
[1:04:13] to you do you know how to get to
[1:04:14] virtuous
[1:04:17] well i didn't know i needed now you know
[1:04:19] what solve that problem
[1:04:21] we got that one out of the way now let's
[1:04:24] go
[1:04:28] see how do we get those virtues
[1:04:36] now the prophet says they're
[1:04:37] automatically added but then he'll turn
[1:04:40] around and said this can't be
[1:04:41] automatically added
[1:04:42] so now you got to get it right how's it
[1:04:44] automatically added but it's not
[1:04:45] automatically added
[1:04:46] it's not laying there just throw it out
[1:04:50] there to you
[1:04:52] no
[1:04:55] it's there for you to stir it up
[1:05:00] right it's there for to get it stirred
[1:05:04] up and get you to
[1:05:05] study in the word and praying and
[1:05:07] seeking god
[1:05:09] the virtues are then automatically
[1:05:11] brought
[1:05:15] i wish i could get it sometime as i was
[1:05:17] riding across the road one time
[1:05:19] i wish i could get it together in my
[1:05:20] mind again to preach it
[1:05:22] of whether i could see the virtues and
[1:05:23] how they was coming forth see you take
[1:05:25] faith and virtue you put them together
[1:05:28] and you got knowledge
[1:05:31] as long as you've got the right faith
[1:05:33] and the right virtue you put them
[1:05:34] together you've got knowledge
[1:05:36] now you're gaining ground faith works
[1:05:38] your knowledge
[1:05:39] now you've got something you understand
[1:05:44] it's laying there but get what i'm
[1:05:47] saying
[1:05:48] the romans taught the israel's
[1:05:52] people in their days and doings
[1:05:55] and the israel people picked it up
[1:05:58] brought it over
[1:06:00] but even though the lord jesus christ
[1:06:03] walked upon this earth
[1:06:05] it never brought a new birth to a person
[1:06:12] he had to go give his life and open it
[1:06:14] up to where he can give it to you
[1:06:16] and make you a child of god because
[1:06:18] that's the first stage
[1:06:20] the romans taught it the correct way the
[1:06:22] first stage is you're born into the
[1:06:24] family
[1:06:25] hey joe your name is joe you're this
[1:06:27] you're a dale you know
[1:06:28] go hey come on you're in the family
[1:06:34] then they put a tutor over you're a
[1:06:36] razor someone to train you
[1:06:40] a school teacher think about these
[1:06:42] school teachers and what they're doing
[1:06:46] teaching you those things what is a
[1:06:49] school
[1:06:49] what is the school master in the stature
[1:06:51] of a perfect man
[1:06:53] don't tell me that you're going to
[1:06:55] listen to a fellow that don't have any
[1:06:56] virtue at all
[1:06:58] explain to you about virtue and you you
[1:07:00] say well
[1:07:01] we got virtue yeah yeah yeah we got that
[1:07:04] no no no no
[1:07:07] it's when god reveals it and makes it
[1:07:09] manifest right
[1:07:10] then we got it all right okay
[1:07:14] because remember my point now three
[1:07:16] stages
[1:07:19] so you got to connect it together what
[1:07:20] new birth
[1:07:22] brings you into the body of christ
[1:07:25] okay that's where brother ryan said the
[1:07:27] pentecostals failed
[1:07:30] he said they've taught the new birth
[1:07:33] that brought you
[1:07:34] into the body but they didn't go
[1:07:37] on with the adoption
[1:07:41] so thereby they cut themselves short
[1:07:46] and then let me state the prophet he
[1:07:48] said you better leave them baptist alone
[1:07:51] because they'll tire you up with the
[1:07:53] word now what's he talking about
[1:07:55] the baptist knew the letter of the word
[1:07:58] they knew the adoptions and the things
[1:08:00] that we were
[1:08:01] required to have they knew even how
[1:08:03] those things came into being
[1:08:08] what it took to bring that they knew
[1:08:10] those things
[1:08:12] all right
[1:08:18] so you don't see anybody preaching
[1:08:19] redemption of the body nowhere
[1:08:22] even in the message they're not
[1:08:23] preaching oh they're preaching yeah one
[1:08:24] of these days is going to be 20 days
[1:08:26] one eight days
[1:08:30] if the virtues are required why not
[1:08:32] let's do one thing
[1:08:34] let's see if we can bring them virtues
[1:08:35] into being
[1:08:37] because if that's what's supposed to be
[1:08:38] that's what's supposed to be
[1:08:45] if tribulation worketh patience then
[1:08:47] let's lay on the tribulation
[1:08:51] might bring some patience to us okay and
[1:08:53] now listen
[1:08:56] so do you understand now i'm trying to
[1:08:58] lay this to point
[1:08:59] because i ain't going to be able to get
[1:09:00] where i want to go and i know that but
[1:09:02] i'm laying it up to a point for you to
[1:09:03] understand
[1:09:04] i'm laying it and telling you exactly
[1:09:06] what i'm preaching
[1:09:08] you ever noticed if you'll listen to
[1:09:10] this advice one time
[1:09:11] tom falboys had a good idea he said you
[1:09:14] come in the morning
[1:09:16] he said you hear what you need to hear
[1:09:20] he said but you come back in the evening
[1:09:22] you'll get understanding
[1:09:24] of what you're supposed to be getting he
[1:09:26] said but if you don't come back in the
[1:09:28] evening
[1:09:28] you ain't going to get it well whose
[1:09:31] fault is it
[1:09:34] so i'm telling you i'm laying out
[1:09:35] exactly what i mean by this
[1:09:37] because there's three stages to adoption
[1:09:40] new birth authorities
[1:09:44] redemption of the body
[1:09:47] write in the word of god then you'll see
[1:09:51] why brother brown spent all those years
[1:09:53] preaching those things
[1:09:56] to try to get us to come to that place
[1:10:00] see there's no excuse to say we don't
[1:10:01] understand
[1:10:04] well
[1:10:09] israel picked up that natural thing and
[1:10:12] applied it
[1:10:13] it became a natural part of
[1:10:16] their environment times or whatever you
[1:10:20] want to call it
[1:10:25] but see when you start teaching it
[1:10:28] then you see that the natural israel
[1:10:30] never reached the redemption of the body
[1:10:34] so they got two stages in top
[1:10:38] we got to have all three amen
[1:10:42] all three has got to come into
[1:10:43] manifestation
[1:10:45] to a change of these bodies that we're
[1:10:47] living in
[1:10:50] there's your adoption in the finality
[1:10:55] but listen no bodily redemption
[1:11:02] to put forth in the old testament you
[1:11:04] had tops of it shadows of it speaking of
[1:11:06] it it happened in a natural they did
[1:11:08] people
[1:11:08] with people was raised from the dead and
[1:11:10] all that but it never brought a total
[1:11:12] reality job was the closest one because
[1:11:14] he said i know my redeemer liveth
[1:11:16] and in the last days i'll stand on this
[1:11:19] earth
[1:11:20] and he said i'll receive that new body
[1:11:24] that i'm supposed to get
[1:11:25] not another body that body redeemed
[1:11:30] bodily redemption people of the message
[1:11:31] want to preach a new why didn't were you
[1:11:33] worried about
[1:11:33] new
[1:11:38] you just got a car in wearing out
[1:11:40] situations to say you got a new car
[1:11:43] it's going to wear out okay but now
[1:11:47] listen
[1:11:50] but paul he says to the galatians
[1:11:57] he said you're going to get tutors and
[1:11:58] governors
[1:12:00] this is what you need you need school
[1:12:03] masters
[1:12:03] you need teachers now can i quote the
[1:12:06] prophet did he say it this way
[1:12:10] he said
[1:12:13] pastors evangelists and things has her
[1:12:16] job what did he say about the teacher
[1:12:19] he said he's the one that sets you in
[1:12:20] order
[1:12:24] to set you in order
[1:12:27] because he's to teach you
[1:12:32] are you listening peter
[1:12:35] you never said anything else after you
[1:12:38] taught the stature of a perfect man to
[1:12:39] talk about love being the headstone
[1:12:41] you never mentioned it coming to the
[1:12:43] redemption i mean the full
[1:12:45] adoptional redemptions
[1:12:51] he said well i really didn't know i
[1:12:52] needed it
[1:12:56] but see paul was the only man
[1:13:00] that could take it all away
[1:13:04] naturally when peter and them john and
[1:13:06] all them picked it up yes sir they
[1:13:08] picked up what he said went and taught
[1:13:09] it
[1:13:10] and it was great the romans was a great
[1:13:16] church
[1:13:19] but listen
[1:13:22] no bodily redemption from the old
[1:13:24] testament in the form of
[1:13:26] one thing you had to get jesus christ
[1:13:30] here
[1:13:32] all right you agree you had to get jesus
[1:13:35] christ here
[1:13:35] to be able to die for us to bring forth
[1:13:37] the sign all right do you agree on this
[1:13:39] you got to get jesus christ inside of
[1:13:41] you in the new birth
[1:13:42] before you can even start talking about
[1:13:43] being a child of god
[1:13:46] well brother dale i believe the message
[1:13:47] amen
[1:13:51] so does the devil sorry
[1:13:55] and he trembled about believing it right
[1:13:58] is that the bible the devil believed in
[1:14:02] god and trembled
[1:14:03] he was scared
[1:14:06] that's what your bible says
[1:14:11] what we know in head knowledge is
[1:14:13] wonderful i wish i've always said i wish
[1:14:15] i had within the revelation of my
[1:14:17] soul being that i am all that was in my
[1:14:20] head as head knowledge
[1:14:22] i do but i admit it's not there in that
[1:14:26] situation but don't let me turn it down
[1:14:32] let me keep studying it until it comes
[1:14:33] to pass
[1:14:37] church listen i was preaching this in
[1:14:40] 1960s
[1:14:45] what was you doing 69
[1:14:50] started teaching and
[1:14:55] and talking about adoption
[1:15:01] that's not bragging i see stealing the
[1:15:03] fact
[1:15:05] i don't have to brag people that have
[1:15:06] been around me know it's true because
[1:15:08] they you get on the internet and just
[1:15:09] say
[1:15:09] did anybody ever hear anybody about them
[1:15:11] did they go you're gonna get it back
[1:15:13] they're gonna say i don't agree with him
[1:15:14] on what he's doing or what he's saying
[1:15:16] i couldn't understand what he was
[1:15:17] talking about i don't agree with it but
[1:15:19] said that one thing about it he tried
[1:15:25] all right but she's trying to get it in
[1:15:29] order
[1:15:30] stage one is your new birth
[1:15:35] you've got to have the new birth because
[1:15:38] that was the adoptional form back there
[1:15:41] the adoptional form back in the old
[1:15:42] testament of the romans
[1:15:44] started with the basis that a child was
[1:15:46] born into their family
[1:15:47] he had every right of the family but yet
[1:15:50] he had to be tutored and trained
[1:15:52] to be brought to the position to where
[1:15:54] he could be trusted
[1:15:55] and he could do and and work everything
[1:15:58] would be right
[1:15:58] right and see back there then you didn't
[1:16:03] have
[1:16:04] talking about authorities of things like
[1:16:06] we do but he did have an authority of a
[1:16:09] a child that was brought into the body i
[1:16:11] mean brought into the
[1:16:12] family as a tutored child that knew how
[1:16:16] to run and raise the
[1:16:17] corn the crops and the doings and how to
[1:16:19] take care of everything he knew
[1:16:21] all about it he knew what his father's
[1:16:23] ideas was
[1:16:28] but he never reached the change of the
[1:16:29] body
[1:16:33] paul says we're under governors and
[1:16:35] tutors and things like that but we still
[1:16:36] ain't reached it
[1:16:42] he said there's something here that i
[1:16:44] don't hold i don't understand
[1:16:48] so he picked it up a little higher
[1:16:51] somebody run that clock back we could be
[1:16:53] all right
[1:16:56] see paul took what he saw
[1:17:01] he didn't deny what he saw well i
[1:17:05] ain't gonna study nothing no romans
[1:17:10] i ain't listening no catholic church
[1:17:15] oh then evidently you don't like the
[1:17:17] statement right around and made where he
[1:17:18] said
[1:17:19] the catholic was the original pentecost
[1:17:21] right
[1:17:26] the catholics was the first pentecostals
[1:17:28] and they wasn't pentecostal
[1:17:30] your prophet said they were and he said
[1:17:34] if they'd
[1:17:34] remind that look what it would have been
[1:17:42] but see we want to throw off on that we
[1:17:43] just said oh we don't want to do with
[1:17:45] them romans and
[1:17:46] then then baptist them methodists and
[1:17:48] and all like that we don't
[1:17:50] you know why because you don't know
[1:17:53] a lot of them talk things that this
[1:17:55] church needs over and over
[1:17:58] to understand
[1:18:05] you're growing in grace and knowledge
[1:18:07] peter picked it up really he got on over
[1:18:09] into starting to bring his message and
[1:18:11] he said newborn babes
[1:18:13] desiring the sincere milk of the word
[1:18:18] then you begin to bring brain to your
[1:18:20] faith virtual knowledge to
[1:18:20] infrastructures god
[1:18:25] he was bringing it to a point of what
[1:18:27] would be called stage two
[1:18:38] let's just go ahead i'll cut it right on
[1:18:40] the point so
[1:18:46] get to uh
[1:18:49] romans where am i at
[1:18:56] i'm missing my own notes
[1:19:00] okay page one if i looked on the front
[1:19:02] page
[1:19:03] let's just read romans you got it bring
[1:19:06] it up romans 8 verse
[1:19:08] 15. i'll try to read as fast as i can
[1:19:12] and do what i can to get to a point
[1:19:16] all right start in verse 14 because yeah
[1:19:18] i left m14
[1:19:20] but watch now for as many as are led by
[1:19:25] the spirit of god
[1:19:27] they are the sons of god
[1:19:30] there's your new birth there's your
[1:19:34] born-again experience
[1:19:37] there's that baby in christ
[1:19:40] there's that desire and ascendancy of
[1:19:42] milk there's those things
[1:19:44] all right lord for we have not received
[1:19:48] the spirit of bondage again to fear we
[1:19:50] we've got away from all that but we have
[1:19:52] received the spirit of adoption
[1:19:55] whereby we cry out by father what is the
[1:19:57] first stage of adoption the spirit of
[1:19:59] adoption
[1:20:02] you can't make it this over here and
[1:20:04] that over there or something it's the
[1:20:05] spirit of adoption
[1:20:07] that's what paul is explaining to the
[1:20:09] romans you you took this from those
[1:20:11] people back there
[1:20:12] you brought in what they brought in
[1:20:14] you've you've
[1:20:15] accepted the son as a child born into
[1:20:18] the family
[1:20:19] and you've put the tutors and trainers
[1:20:21] and school masters and
[1:20:23] and guardians over them to teach them
[1:20:25] and bring them into
[1:20:27] a position of manifestation to where
[1:20:30] they can be a christian
[1:20:33] god wants his children to be christian
[1:20:36] amen oh yeah i was looking one day on
[1:20:38] the wall or the house and we had the
[1:20:39] pictures up
[1:20:40] years ago down kind of wall you know
[1:20:42] like that and it run down there and wade
[1:20:43] and i was
[1:20:44] tearing was anna and you know we had
[1:20:47] their
[1:20:47] little different stages in life you know
[1:20:50] four
[1:20:50] five years old at nine years old just
[1:20:53] had them on the wall
[1:20:54] and you could stand and look at them and
[1:20:56] i'd say you know what i'd like to see
[1:20:58] terrance stayed right there
[1:21:00] because i wouldn't have had the problems
[1:21:02] that i had with him
[1:21:04] had he stayed right there
[1:21:07] because i remember that
[1:21:12] huh
[1:21:16] right because they were my children
[1:21:20] but you know what the talk came said
[1:21:22] yeah but if he stayed there he wouldn't
[1:21:23] grow up
[1:21:25] he wouldn't become what you want him to
[1:21:28] be
[1:21:31] i set out right then to do one thing to
[1:21:33] try to teach my children
[1:21:38] the ways of god through the stature of a
[1:21:40] perfect man
[1:21:41] not necessarily me having it but me be
[1:21:43] able to preach it
[1:21:46] to where they could receive it that's my
[1:21:49] goal whether or not i get it to get
[1:21:50] there or whatever don't make no
[1:21:52] difference with me
[1:21:53] my goal is to see you there
[1:22:00] i have to get started if i don't want
[1:22:02] but what do you receive you receive the
[1:22:04] spirit of adoption the spirit of
[1:22:05] adoption is your new birth
[1:22:07] the spirit of adoption is your new birth
[1:22:10] you're adopted into the family a child
[1:22:13] that's born into the family
[1:22:14] is then coming forth then to be adopted
[1:22:16] into the parts of
[1:22:18] virtues and and authorities all right so
[1:22:21] take the first one
[1:22:22] and put it as a spirit of adoption and
[1:22:25] put that
[1:22:26] identification i got these written in my
[1:22:30] bible on mar
[1:22:31] i mean on romans i got stage one
[1:22:34] identification stage two authority stage
[1:22:38] three
[1:22:38] change the body i've had them in there
[1:22:41] ever since i've come in this message
[1:22:44] listen you have not received the spirit
[1:22:47] of bondage again to fear
[1:22:50] you don't have no set of rules or just
[1:22:51] that or the other to try to act like a
[1:22:53] child you're just born
[1:22:54] there because you receive the spirit of
[1:22:56] adoption stage one
[1:22:58] the spirit itself beareth witness with
[1:23:00] our spirit what spirit
[1:23:01] the holy spirit the holy spirit is the
[1:23:03] new birth holy spirit itself beareth
[1:23:05] witness with our spirit that we are the
[1:23:07] children of god
[1:23:08] you get to virtue somebody's going to
[1:23:09] see it all right come on
[1:23:13] and if children then heirs
[1:23:17] heirs of god and join ours with christ
[1:23:21] if so be that we suffer with him
[1:23:26] that we may be also glorified together
[1:23:28] what is it
[1:23:30] heirs what about being
[1:23:34] joint heirs
[1:23:38] what about being joint heirs with jesus
[1:23:42] you know if you've got joiners you're
[1:23:43] supposed to have everybody supposed to
[1:23:44] have the same right
[1:23:46] i mean if his joint is joined it's
[1:23:47] supposed to be the same both of you got
[1:23:48] the same thing
[1:23:49] same amount same doing okay so what's
[1:23:52] the second stage
[1:23:55] you're moving away from from just being
[1:23:57] a child going towards something
[1:23:59] else down here now watch it for i reckon
[1:24:02] that the sufferings of this present time
[1:24:04] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:24:06] glory which shall be revealed in us
[1:24:08] watch now for the earnest expectation of
[1:24:11] the creature
[1:24:12] waited for the manifestation of the sons
[1:24:14] of god what is manifest
[1:24:16] to make known second stage of adoption
[1:24:19] is what to make known
[1:24:20] authority where that jesus over there
[1:24:23] was standing on river jordan
[1:24:26] and the holy spirit come down and said
[1:24:27] this is my beloved son
[1:24:29] in whom i'm pleased to dwell
[1:24:32] now don't put here you him there wait
[1:24:34] until you get over to matthew 17 if we
[1:24:36] get the time to get there if you don't
[1:24:38] put matthew 13 as river jordan matthew
[1:24:40] 17 is jesus on the mount of
[1:24:42] transfiguration
[1:24:43] all right because he comes to full
[1:24:45] authority over there okay watch now
[1:24:47] for the creature was made subject to
[1:24:49] vanity
[1:24:50] not willingly but by reason of him who
[1:24:52] has subjected the same in hope in other
[1:24:54] words we were put down under all of this
[1:24:56] thing but we're waiting on the
[1:24:57] manifestation of the sons of god
[1:25:00] because the creature itself also shall
[1:25:02] be delivered from the bondage of
[1:25:04] corruption
[1:25:05] into the glorious liberty of the
[1:25:06] children of god even nature itself is
[1:25:08] groaning waiting for the children of god
[1:25:10] to come to their place
[1:25:14] that bull that the prophet said if i'd
[1:25:17] have had my gun
[1:25:19] he was a natural man right he said i
[1:25:21] would have shot and went and paid for it
[1:25:26] but he didn't have the gun
[1:25:29] but he had more than the gun
[1:25:33] he said bull go lay down
[1:25:38] that old bull just walked over and laid
[1:25:39] down
[1:25:43] he had authority he had manifestation
[1:25:48] see paul knew peter and him had
[1:25:50] authority and manifestation
[1:25:53] he knew those that was there with him
[1:25:55] had those things he knew it
[1:25:56] he honored peter he didn't throw off on
[1:25:58] him about the statue of a perfect man
[1:26:00] he said you're trying to get that to
[1:26:01] there you're doing the greatest thing
[1:26:03] that could be done peter because
[1:26:04] i have tried to get this virtues into
[1:26:07] the people
[1:26:08] and can't get it it's just something
[1:26:09] they're not taking my teaching
[1:26:11] but said you are taking the minute the
[1:26:13] message
[1:26:14] back and bringing it into the statue of
[1:26:16] a perfect man
[1:26:20] because that's what peter was doing paul
[1:26:24] didn't take all of the authorities all
[1:26:26] of
[1:26:26] everything but what did it be for we
[1:26:28] know that the whole creation growneth
[1:26:29] and travaileth and pained together until
[1:26:31] now
[1:26:32] now watch but our not only they but
[1:26:34] ourselves also which have the first
[1:26:36] fruits of the spirit
[1:26:38] which have the first fruits fourteen's
[1:26:40] verse up our first fruits
[1:26:41] which have the first fruits of the
[1:26:43] spirit even we ourselves grown
[1:26:46] authority waiting within ourselves
[1:26:48] waiting for the adoption
[1:26:51] to wit the redemption
[1:26:54] of our body to which means to understand
[1:26:58] i know what it means witnessing et
[1:26:59] cetera et cetera all right fine to use
[1:27:01] them
[1:27:03] but i like it where it says to wit the
[1:27:04] redemption of our body
[1:27:06] to understand
[1:27:09] you realize this message come to bring
[1:27:11] us the understanding
[1:27:13] of the adoption
[1:27:17] paul had the message
[1:27:21] he took what the natural romans
[1:27:24] could do and adopted their children and
[1:27:28] brought them in that and then taught
[1:27:29] them intuited them
[1:27:30] brought them into authority but as far
[1:27:31] as they could go
[1:27:34] then you started your new testament now
[1:27:37] i'm drawing five so
[1:27:38] following you started your new testament
[1:27:42] you had people there that was like peter
[1:27:43] in them that could stand there and say
[1:27:45] silver and gold have i none but in the
[1:27:47] name of jesus christ
[1:27:49] they could talk about the new birth
[1:27:50] because they had the new birth
[1:27:53] peter says you know growing in grace and
[1:27:54] knowledge
[1:27:57] desiring the sincere milk of the word
[1:27:58] that you may grow by thereby he was
[1:28:00] teaching those things to the people
[1:28:03] and as he was doing that
[1:28:06] god wasn't through because god knew
[1:28:10] there was something missing
[1:28:13] so he says paul go down to the romans
[1:28:21] because they got this thing started
[1:28:24] and maybe by going to some of them that
[1:28:28] gets borne again
[1:28:29] they'll be able to understand what i'm
[1:28:31] fixing to tell you
[1:28:33] because i'm going to tell you how the
[1:28:35] body is redeemed
[1:28:43] come on do you understand three stages
[1:28:46] to adoption not two
[1:28:48] see
[1:28:52] you hear the people of this message talk
[1:28:54] about these things but listen to what
[1:28:55] are they talking about
[1:28:56] do they take it all the way to the
[1:28:58] change of the body
[1:29:03] or do they just stop at them because
[1:29:06] here's what most people had and i was
[1:29:07] listening was the other day
[1:29:09] brother brown says you talk about
[1:29:11] manifested sons of god
[1:29:12] he said you say we we need them in the
[1:29:15] millennium
[1:29:17] now listen i'll give it to you it's
[1:29:19] almost verbatim he said you say
[1:29:20] that we're talking about the manifested
[1:29:22] sons of god in the millennium he said we
[1:29:24] don't need them in the millennium
[1:29:25] he said we need them right now
[1:29:32] we need them right now
[1:29:36] we need manifested sons and daughters of
[1:29:38] god right now
[1:29:39] you ain't going to need it in the
[1:29:40] millennium there ain't going to be no
[1:29:41] prayer lines or sickness or
[1:29:43] or something wrong legs missing or arms
[1:29:45] missing something in the millennium
[1:29:50] you won't even have that in the group
[1:29:51] that can come up in bankruptcy after the
[1:29:53] millennium
[1:29:56] what do you understand paul
[1:30:02] was trying to explain
[1:30:06] the thing that job said i can see it
[1:30:11] and i know it
[1:30:17] ever thought about what he was saying
[1:30:18] when he said i know
[1:30:21] i know my redeemer liveth come on
[1:30:23] musicians
[1:30:25] i know my redeemer liveth
[1:30:32] but he said but in the last days
[1:30:36] come on joe said that right but all at
[1:30:39] once something struck him
[1:30:43] and when it struck him he said i know
[1:30:46] my redeemer liveth now
[1:30:53] a millennial reign manifested son and
[1:30:56] daughter of god are all right but i
[1:30:58] uh we need them now i cry every night
[1:31:01] and pray and think about all of these
[1:31:03] that are sick and i go through the list
[1:31:05] of everybody and i said lord think about
[1:31:07] it
[1:31:09] i said lord you promised it
[1:31:12] these things wouldn't come upon us and i
[1:31:15] don't believe they have
[1:31:17] i don't believe the the tribulation that
[1:31:20] is spoke of there in the bible and all i
[1:31:23] don't believe it's poured out
[1:31:24] yet that's the wrath of god poured out
[1:31:26] we're still under the grace of almighty
[1:31:28] god
[1:31:28] we're still under praying for the sick
[1:31:30] and things like that
[1:31:32] but one of these days when it comes
[1:31:34] under that basis and god's wrath is
[1:31:36] poured out there's no need for you to
[1:31:37] pray
[1:31:38] it won't be nothing to pray the bible
[1:31:40] said they cry for the rocks and things
[1:31:42] to fall on and hide them from the eyes
[1:31:44] of him
[1:31:47] but now if we can't keep up with the
[1:31:50] footman
[1:31:52] the bible said if you can't keep up with
[1:31:54] the foot what about when the horsemen
[1:31:55] get here
[1:31:58] in other words you can't keep up with
[1:31:59] the footman what are you going to do
[1:32:00] when the horses come out and start
[1:32:01] running
[1:32:06] that's the stature of a perfect man
[1:32:07] that's the things we need to study
[1:32:09] as to how to get these virtues and
[1:32:11] things and to come into manifestation
[1:32:18] and it is not all head knowledge because
[1:32:21] head knowledge will not bring you
[1:32:22] nothing
[1:32:23] [Music]
[1:32:24] but an uplifted
[1:32:27] person that thinks they know something
[1:32:36] there ain't nobody in this building no
[1:32:38] different than anybody else
[1:32:40] i don't care who you are and where you
[1:32:42] come from
[1:32:43] we're all one in the body of christ
[1:32:47] you've heard me tell the story of the
[1:32:49] dream that i had
[1:32:51] when all these white people was
[1:32:52] following me
[1:32:54] walking through white sand looked over
[1:32:57] to the side and there come a dark
[1:32:58] cloud and not not just say now and plain
[1:33:01] in language put it
[1:33:02] not black negro african black i'm
[1:33:05] talking about dark colored race of
[1:33:07] people which could be anything from any
[1:33:09] parts of the world the chinese are
[1:33:11] dark-colored
[1:33:12] this the dark color they all that the
[1:33:14] the foreign countries are a lot of it so
[1:33:16] you see i'm not talking about that
[1:33:17] but a group of people came in and when
[1:33:19] they did i just stopped
[1:33:21] and they looked and the man stood out
[1:33:24] and said
[1:33:25] now you've got to teach us
[1:33:32] turn around and look
[1:33:37] if you counted the darkness of any race
[1:33:40] of anything you wanted to count whether
[1:33:42] it be
[1:33:43] chinese or whether it be japanese or
[1:33:45] whether it be vietnamese or koreans or
[1:33:47] anything
[1:33:48] you turn it just turn around and look
[1:33:50] you'll see this is probably more
[1:33:52] dark colored people than they are white
