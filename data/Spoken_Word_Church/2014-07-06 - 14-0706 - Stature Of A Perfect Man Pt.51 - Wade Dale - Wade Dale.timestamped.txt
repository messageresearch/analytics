[0:02] a moment
[0:07] Lord bless you
[0:09] good morning good morning good to have
[0:13] milk back
[0:15] everybody keep me um Brother Rice and
[0:18] cabbage
[0:20] little baby in my prayer
[0:23] a large one he'll do he's a Healer
[0:31] the body's just got to come under
[0:33] suggestion of what we believe so it has
[0:37] good
[0:40] We Believe
[0:42] brotherly kindness
[0:45] let's read first second Peter 1.
[0:46] according to as his divine power hath
[0:48] given unto us all things that repenteth
[0:50] unto life and regardless through the
[0:53] knowledge of him that has called us the
[0:54] glory and virtue
[0:56] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[0:58] great and precious promises by these he
[1:01] might be Protectors of the divine nature
[1:03] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:05] the world through lust besides this
[1:09] besides your born-again experience
[1:11] if all diligence and to your faith verse
[1:13] you in the verse your knowledge on this
[1:15] Temperance patience patience godliness
[1:17] and the godliness brotherly kindness and
[1:20] brotherly kindness charity
[1:23] for if these things be in you and abound
[1:26] they make you that you shall need to be
[1:28] Barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of
[1:30] our Lord Jesus Christ but he that
[1:32] lacketh these things is blind and cannot
[1:35] see it far off and have forgotten that
[1:38] he was purged
[1:39] from his old sins and we were kind of
[1:42] mentioning this last night with that
[1:43] brother Ramsey
[1:45] uh
[1:46] you didn't lose the salvation
[1:50] but he did lose
[1:52] his inheritance as far as going on in a
[1:55] statue of a perfect man or as far as
[1:57] going on with God
[1:58] he said I'm not going to do this anymore
[2:00] I'm I'm gonna go get him some beer and
[2:03] I'm gonna go drink and he just got an
[2:05] evil spirit on him I was looking while
[2:07] we were talking about that uh
[2:09] brother Brown
[2:11] said he had a critical spirit one time
[2:13] on him
[2:15] and he was asking people to pray to get
[2:17] it off of
[2:18] a prophet
[2:20] critical spirit he told Brother Charlie
[2:22] who did
[2:23] fear
[2:27] well so did Brother Brown I've got the
[2:28] quotes right here
[2:30] brother random said I have a critical
[2:32] spirit and I'm praying that God will get
[2:34] it off okay so just look up critical
[2:38] spirit it's only about eight quotes and
[2:40] all of them are pretty much him talking
[2:42] about himself having a crazy spirit
[2:47] oh sure sees all the wrong
[2:50] a prophet condemns
[2:53] to the ones that won't listen now he's
[2:55] salvation to the ones that listen but he
[2:58] condemns the ones that don't listen so
[3:01] he it was actually God condemning
[3:04] because really what he was doing was he
[3:06] was he was wondering why people just
[3:07] didn't see the light
[3:09] and he was you know at being very
[3:11] critical about how the women dressed and
[3:13] how preachers conducted their stuff he
[3:15] had been he had a very critical spirit
[3:16] he said and that was in 1954 I think it
[3:19] was and then he was still talking about
[3:21] it in 1957 I think I'm not gonna go back
[3:24] to it but but you got to remember one
[3:26] thing once you get born again that
[3:29] doesn't you're not immune from the devil
[3:32] right you're not immune from his tactics
[3:35] and his actions and his ways and you're
[3:38] not immune from a spirit getting on it
[3:39] we all get spared right I don't know
[3:43] about you but I do you get a critical
[3:45] spirit or or one and you know sometimes
[3:48] you just don't care and okay and that
[3:50] was that brother Ramsey he just didn't
[3:51] care anymore he probably they don't tell
[3:54] him what he went to because brother
[3:55] round never said he went through thus
[3:57] and so he was just having a hard time
[3:59] and he got a spirit on him then he just
[4:02] didn't care anymore wasn't no preach
[4:04] anymore
[4:06] but he said the man was saved
[4:08] because I read that last night bible
[4:10] study brother random knew he was saved
[4:13] but God shortened his life
[4:15] because of his actions
[4:17] all right so
[4:20] my quote to you is is to live a long
[4:23] life
[4:25] do these virtues
[4:28] because somebody's got to be perfected
[4:30] and you can't you can't
[4:31] die
[4:34] right
[4:35] if you go on to perfection
[4:39] that's the destruction of death
[4:42] okay but if you say well I I just can't
[4:45] love my neighbors myself well you know
[4:47] what you're going to die and you're
[4:48] going to go by the grave you're not
[4:49] going to take a change that's good
[4:52] you're just not
[4:54] you're going to agree
[4:57] Temperance patience all these things
[5:00] you're going to a grave if you do not
[5:02] have these virtues working in your life
[5:04] but continue to go on
[5:07] to the Capstone of love
[5:10] so brotherly kindness like I said it's a
[5:12] hard one
[5:14] it's really hard to love somebody that
[5:16] hates you it's not hard to love somebody
[5:18] love you right that's easy
[5:22] it's just real easy for me to love her
[5:25] you know and but now somebody else that
[5:29] rubs against you and goes against you
[5:31] it's hard to love them too right okay
[5:37] I was thinking the same thing what
[5:43] you whale I wasn't thinking about you
[5:50] hate me
[5:52] Lord it was the woman you did Lord
[5:56] used to be a long time when we go out
[5:58] we're ready to quote last weekend as a
[6:00] neighbor when he was on the farm and
[6:01] somebody got sick we'd go up and cut it
[6:03] going cut wood bring it in nowadays you
[6:05] you don't even know your neighbor's dead
[6:07] unless you read it in the paper now this
[6:09] was back in 1955.
[6:13] what about now
[6:16] brotherly love has ceased it's awful
[6:19] then he then he condemned his wife
[6:22] for going downtown
[6:24] he said how you do sister Branham I
[6:26] looked over at Mita and I said well you
[6:27] didn't speak to that woman she said yes
[6:29] I did and I said well I didn't hear you
[6:30] she said I smiled
[6:34] oh that little old silly grin
[6:39] that's not and that's kind of a dish on
[6:41] her really he knew that she gave that
[6:44] really silly grant that she really
[6:46] didn't mean what she's talking about
[6:48] that old fake grin oh that little silly
[6:51] old grand old silly green that's not
[6:54] speaking to anybody get out there on the
[6:56] street and shake her hand and say hello
[6:57] sister I'm glad to meet you Amen brother
[6:59] that's what get back to the
[7:01] old-fashioned Ewing line again where men
[7:03] are Christians we're Christians and men
[7:04] and women live like they ought to
[7:07] now look right he's he says right here
[7:10] now we are facing the day that went is
[7:12] prophesied to us that brother love will
[7:14] become a strange thing among people
[7:16] all right well now that comes from
[7:18] Matthew we're going to read it here in
[7:20] Matthew 24. remember this is the this is
[7:23] God
[7:24] talking
[7:25] telling the disciples
[7:27] they ask you the three questions what
[7:29] would the end be when's his son of this
[7:31] coming and something about the temple
[7:33] We're Not Gonna don't worry about that
[7:34] right now Jesus taught us then Jesus
[7:37] begins to tell us take heed that no man
[7:38] deceive you okay
[7:40] he starts telling them what's going to
[7:42] happen and then you look down here in
[7:44] verse 11.
[7:45] many false prophets you arise and shall
[7:47] receive many and because iniquity shall
[7:50] abound the love of many shall why it's
[7:53] cold
[7:54] all right so we're prophesied that
[7:56] that's what's happening
[7:59] but watch what brother Brown says now
[8:02] God's you know Jesus said at the end
[8:05] time the love of me is going to watch
[8:06] Gold Coast remember this is the seal
[8:08] Jesus is preaching the seals to the
[8:10] disciples
[8:12] says it's my humble belief that that is
[8:14] the greatest of all the gifts that there
[8:16] is in God's Bible
[8:19] Satan's tearing it apart
[8:22] if the Lord Jesus should stand on the
[8:24] platform tonight and look me in the face
[8:26] and say I'm going to give you your
[8:28] choice you can be a great person a great
[8:30] Minister I'll give you a gift to
[8:32] preaching the gospel I give you the gift
[8:34] of teaching a word or I'll give you the
[8:35] gift of Divine Healing I'll give you the
[8:37] gift of Prophecy or I'll make you a
[8:38] prophet or any of the fine Gifts of
[8:40] Faith any of the gifts that's in the
[8:42] Bible I'll give them everyone to you but
[8:44] I'm going to withhold love from you or
[8:46] either I'll give you love and withhold
[8:47] the gift I said Lord take all the gifts
[8:49] and let me have the love okay say for no
[8:53] matter how many gifts we got
[8:55] they will never do us any good we talked
[8:57] about that last night
[8:58] except the love of God is the motive
[9:01] behind the gift
[9:03] we must have love
[9:07] D so there is your
[9:12] then we look and see that last week we
[9:14] talked about
[9:17] uh
[9:19] now let's find out what Pentecost had to
[9:21] find out what we got lacking
[9:24] so they started out
[9:26] remember what happened in the book of
[9:28] Acts they had all things common
[9:31] now remember Brotherly Love is that
[9:35] today
[9:36] we're going to announce today that Bob
[9:38] is going to be our head overseer
[9:41] tomorrow we're going to the bank and
[9:43] we're going to withdraw all of our money
[9:45] every bit of it not a penny less
[9:48] and we're going to give it to Bob and
[9:51] Bob is going to distribute it as we need
[9:53] it
[9:55] now most of you have already said in
[9:56] your mind I ain't doing that
[9:58] well then you ain't got brotherly luck
[10:01] that's what he said right here
[10:05] because anani since the fire comes up
[10:09] and they were the ones that said okay we
[10:11] gave all
[10:14] but they withheld some money
[10:16] and the Holy Spirit called them out and
[10:18] killed them both or took their life for
[10:21] withholding just a little amount of
[10:23] money that they thought they were giving
[10:24] off because the confession was we gave
[10:28] off
[10:29] all right see if they had not confessed
[10:31] if they had to just come up and said
[10:32] look this is all we can give that's
[10:34] right it'd have been different
[10:37] but they asked and they asked Peter and
[10:40] they said we gave off
[10:42] well the Holy Spirit spoke through Peter
[10:46] and said why have you lied you didn't
[10:48] lie to Peter you lied to the Holy Ghost
[10:49] right
[10:51] so there you see that brotherly love
[10:53] what will happen to you yeah
[10:58] it'll kill you
[11:01] it was the life yeah yeah that's what
[11:04] I'm saying it was the LIE they said we
[11:05] gave off and they didn't if they would
[11:08] have said we gave what we could that's
[11:10] true that's not a lot they gave what
[11:12] they could but now it says in the Bible
[11:15] they gave all all of them they put all
[11:16] their money pulled all their money
[11:18] together and they distribute it and sent
[11:20] people out to do Mission work and stuff
[11:22] like that
[11:23] and
[11:25] now
[11:28] they have to have a lot of confidence in
[11:29] Peter do you think maybe they gave all
[11:32] of them
[11:34] you know they gave all right the gay
[11:36] member let's see they were killed
[11:41] let's see if we can find them now no I
[11:43] meant when it says
[11:51] you don't have to give anything you're
[11:54] not forcing thanks champion
[12:00] foreign
[12:14] all right
[12:15] and the moment verse 32 Acts
[12:22] verse chapter 4 verse 32.
[12:25] and most of them that believe were in
[12:27] one heart and of one soul
[12:31] and neither any of them that that all of
[12:34] the things which he possessed was his
[12:36] own
[12:37] that's right
[12:39] all said this is what we're going to do
[12:42] right neither said any of them that all
[12:45] of the things would be possessed with
[12:47] his own but they had all things coming
[12:50] and with great power gave the apostles
[12:52] witness of the resurrection of Lord
[12:53] Jesus and great grace was upon them
[12:55] neither was there any among them that
[12:57] lacked for as many as were possessions
[12:59] of land or houses sold them
[13:01] so what just money they gave everything
[13:04] sold them and brought the prices of the
[13:08] things that were sold
[13:10] didn't say they withheld anything
[13:13] and write them down at the Apostle's
[13:15] feet and the distribution was made unto
[13:17] every man according as he had made
[13:20] and Joseph who is by the apostle was
[13:23] surname Barnabas which is being
[13:25] interpreted the son of consolation a
[13:27] leviting of the country of Cyprus having
[13:29] land sold it
[13:31] and he brought the money and later this
[13:33] apocalypse but a certain man mayonnaise
[13:36] with suffering who I stole the
[13:38] possession and kept back part of the
[13:40] price
[13:43] okay
[13:44] his wife also being private to it and
[13:47] brought a certain part and later this
[13:49] Apostle Pete so Peterson and asked why I
[13:51] had Satan feel thine heart the life of
[13:53] the Holy Ghost and keep back part of the
[13:55] price of land
[13:56] while it remained was it not thine own
[14:00] and after it was shown was it not in
[14:02] thine own power why has thou conceived
[14:05] this thing in thy heart thou has not
[14:07] lied unto men but unto God
[14:10] and then he died then his wife comes in
[14:12] and she says the same thing she does I
[14:15] think they sold their houses
[14:17] let's read that one more time
[14:20] let's read that one more time he says
[14:22] they sold their houses
[14:24] it
[14:25] their needs were met as they were needed
[14:28] maybe they rented something
[14:34] for as many as were possessions of lands
[14:37] or houses sold them what part of that do
[14:40] you know yes
[14:42] houses where did they go at night if
[14:45] they sold their own home nobody see what
[14:48] I'm saying
[14:49] distribution was made unto every man
[14:51] accordingly
[14:53] having land sold it and brought some
[14:56] money and later that the Apostle feed
[14:57] even people that have Lane had land
[15:03] listen
[15:04] what I'm trying to say is those apostles
[15:08] Peter James John the ones that were
[15:11] entrusted to do the distribution right
[15:14] they were at brotherly kindness on the
[15:17] pyramid
[15:18] nobody understand that they have the
[15:20] faith of the father when the Holy Ghost
[15:22] fell on the 120 in the upper room they
[15:24] had been tutored by Jesus Jesus had
[15:26] brought them to a place to where when
[15:29] the Holy Ghost fell it not only
[15:30] quickened their soul but it brought all
[15:32] these virtues into their life
[15:35] so that's totally different than what me
[15:37] and you have even
[15:39] that we didn't start that way yeah we
[15:41] started with a new birth as a baby
[15:43] not having a lot of virtue a lot of
[15:45] having knowledge not having tempered
[15:47] patients we had to grow up through the
[15:48] statue of a perfect man
[15:50] they had already been tutored by God
[15:52] himself
[15:53] so when God himself come back and
[15:55] watered or quickened what he had already
[15:58] planted
[16:01] they had brotherly kindness well the
[16:03] brotherly kindness was the problem with
[16:05] me not giving my money to Bob is I've
[16:07] got some kind of issue that I don't even
[16:10] that I don't trust him that's not
[16:12] brotherly kindness if he's got the Holy
[16:14] Ghost
[16:15] and if he's at the Statue of a perfect
[16:16] man that he that Peter and James and
[16:18] John were what I'm saying is those
[16:20] people trusted those men had to do some
[16:23] provision for them to have that much
[16:25] trust yes oh yeah I mean they needed
[16:27] their seller they didn't sell their
[16:28] houses and give it to Peter and them and
[16:30] Peter and them live in a mansion and
[16:31] everybody else has a limited shot
[16:46] because see
[16:48] the communal attitude is where that
[16:51] comes from
[16:53] so man takes it and perverts it and puts
[16:55] everybody in a commune
[16:57] and they have everything coming wives
[16:59] and everything husbands and all that
[17:01] they do all that communal stuff right
[17:03] but the the the way the church was first
[17:06] set up in Jerusalem the foundation of
[17:09] the church were built on is is they
[17:11] trusted those men
[17:13] to take care of what was going on
[17:15] and there was no question because see
[17:17] ananas had a question
[17:19] or he wouldn't give it all
[17:22] and he said why'd you lie I said you
[17:23] didn't lie to me you lied to the Holy
[17:25] Ghost right right so the Holy Ghost must
[17:27] have been on the scene
[17:28] to provide see that's our problem our
[17:30] problem is and sorry sister Judy the
[17:32] problem is is you don't trust giving
[17:35] your money to somebody else
[17:38] that's the whole thing I don't mind if I
[17:40] had a million dollars I'd give it to
[17:42] Bobby it wouldn't bother me a minute
[18:08] because you had these people that had
[18:11] these people that had not
[18:13] but the people that had not and people
[18:15] that had that game all once they pulled
[18:17] it together they all lived in a defense
[18:20] apartment or whatever you want to say
[18:24] yeah yeah
[18:31] but listen let's don't forget this this
[18:33] is the foundation
[18:35] of the Christian church right I think so
[18:38] whatever was the foundation was it had
[18:40] to be right that's right or the building
[18:43] couldn't have been built on top of it
[18:45] I'm talking about what we're walking I'm
[18:47] talking about what we're walking on
[18:48] right now
[18:50] it's what we're talking about and if we
[18:51] have a problem with what they started
[18:53] then we've got a problem I told you
[18:55] brother kindness is going to be a
[18:56] problem right that's right because it
[18:59] rubs it this the privacy of this man
[19:03] and we should have nothing private and
[19:05] that's right if we got something private
[19:06] we got a problem man and I said
[19:07] something private he had a problem
[19:09] maybe it was just green screen
[19:13] I think what I think maybe not so much
[19:16] greed I think he didn't trust just like
[19:18] white treaty I'm sorry it's just true
[19:20] but it's not you have no trust in who
[19:22] you're giving it to exactly right I
[19:24] think it's uh had something to do with
[19:25] having faith too in God to provide you
[19:29] know well they had faith in those men
[19:32] that were of God right but to do exactly
[19:36] what they're in those men yes yeah
[19:38] because remember Peter said you didn't
[19:39] lie to me yeah right you lied to God
[19:41] that's right but now God wasn't there
[19:44] standing physically it was God in Peter
[19:47] right right see that's what we got again
[19:49] what do we got to get back to
[19:52] and it's not putting all right but it is
[19:55] putting our faith in brother Dale yes
[19:57] exactly my my my income no not my income
[20:02] my income right right my income that's
[20:06] right depends on him
[20:10] now my out goal depends on me that's
[20:12] right but my income depends on him if we
[20:15] don't think that he's of God then we
[20:17] need to get fun you know right like the
[20:19] queen bee we were talking about last
[20:20] night is the queen bee don't perform
[20:23] the other bass killer Mega medal right
[20:26] so you know same thing with this this is
[20:29] the whole thing people I'm telling you
[20:31] this might all stir this all up
[20:33] but remember it didn't Stir It Up but in
[20:36] two people
[20:38] when the church first started and I
[20:40] sensed the fire that's the only two
[20:42] people that's recorded that had a
[20:44] problem with this foundation of the
[20:47] original Christian church and they said
[20:50] we ain't giving off
[20:51] we're keeping some of us
[20:56] right yes
[21:07] that's why I believe that this the Bible
[21:09] says the love of money is the root of
[21:11] all evil not the money the love of money
[21:14] is a root of all evil
[21:17] I think talking about brother Dale I
[21:20] think that some people have a problem
[21:22] separating the man yes from in the
[21:25] pulpits from the god in the man right
[21:28] there right
[21:29] and because you're seeing the man
[21:33] and and see that's the problem
[21:36] that's a problem they had in Jesus sure
[21:39] yeah exactly
[21:41] you right yeah I'm playing
[21:45] we see you eat every day we see you
[21:48] hungry we see you go to the bathroom we
[21:50] see you walk you walk around with
[21:52] prostitutes and and druggies and you
[21:55] know you're right he wasn't he the only
[21:57] time he ever got in the temple was to
[21:59] get on the mountain all right really so
[22:02] you look at Jesus and you go
[22:05] she had nothing either and yeah he
[22:07] didn't know a place to lay his head you
[22:09] know so
[22:10] but it was done it's a lot of money is
[22:12] the root of all evil yeah it's not the
[22:14] money it's the love of it because it
[22:16] takes money
[22:20] the
[22:23] loss of the
[22:26] proud of the eye lust in the flesh
[22:29] but that was a try
[22:31] yeah you know they said it right they
[22:34] could give off well that had Paul had in
[22:37] his mind I'm not gonna put these people
[22:40] out on the street I don't I'm gonna
[22:42] provide for them but everybody just give
[22:44] you all and we'll provide for everybody
[22:46] and I think they probably knew that all
[22:49] right
[22:52] well obviously it worked
[22:56] because we're still living off that
[22:57] Foundation yeah
[22:59] you can't get off the foundation right
[23:01] if the foundation was true you got to
[23:04] stay on that Foundation now men have
[23:06] perverted it like I said that the guy
[23:08] down in Athens
[23:10] what's up
[23:12] Z Pike
[23:14] he took the same
[23:16] Bethlehem or whatever that is the place
[23:19] down there it's close to Heaven
[23:21] Monroe but he that was a an idea
[23:27] but he took the people to his South not
[23:30] to God and took his people to the South
[23:33] to himself and they had all things
[23:34] common they had come in and that's why
[23:36] they call it a commune because
[23:37] everything's common
[23:38] so uh
[23:40] uh and then brother Branham preaching
[23:42] the token message in a trailer to that
[23:44] group out in Arizona that uh gold and
[23:47] and all them moved out there and brother
[23:49] Brown said you will never be successful
[23:51] finally went about it the wrong way they
[23:53] were building it on a man
[23:55] not the word of God now this was built
[23:58] on
[23:59] the foundation of the Apostles and
[24:01] Prophets I'm quoting scripture Jesus
[24:03] Christ being a Chief Cornerstone all
[24:05] right so that Cornerstone will start is
[24:07] that Cornerstone cannot be anything
[24:09] different than the headstone all right
[24:10] or you got two gods
[24:12] until the Cornerstone was
[24:15] and not now that we have to give all of
[24:17] our money brother now but you know what
[24:19] we give them a big part of our income
[24:20] sure we tithe offerings work and all the
[24:24] things we do forward that to the running
[24:27] of the church so it takes money to run
[24:29] to church
[24:29] but these people right here that's where
[24:31] brotherly kindness
[24:34] right right here
[24:38] right here
[24:40] you can read all this
[24:41] the first thing that Pentecost produced
[24:44] was Brotherly Love now that's not 1906
[24:47] Pentecost
[24:48] that's the original Pentecost
[24:51] it tore down the middle wall of
[24:53] partitions and made a Brotherhood to
[24:56] such a way that they had everything in
[24:58] common in the Bible days in front of it
[25:03] I was teaching them love too I love him
[25:06] well Brotherly Love really is what you
[25:08] call it not really kindness It's
[25:09] Brotherly Love yeah I mean it says
[25:11] really kindness but it is brotherly love
[25:14] and it's love for the brother
[25:18] uh we brother William and I were talking
[25:21] this morning
[25:22] and uh
[25:24] we were talking about you know the sign
[25:26] of the times and all the things coming
[25:28] up
[25:29] he uh he sells things on the internet
[25:31] where they sell some things to these
[25:33] Preppers
[25:34] you know what preppers are preppers are
[25:36] waiting for the end time or waiting for
[25:38] hard times so they're digging bunkers in
[25:40] there
[25:41] and they're storing stuff and and he
[25:44] sold parachute cord and they used
[25:46] parachute cord for many different things
[25:48] for their preparation for the end time
[25:51] but I found there's nowhere in the Bible
[25:54] it says to store up anything except the
[25:57] word of God
[25:58] to not depending on even what you're
[26:00] going to say that's right right right it
[26:03] says you it'll be given to you that's
[26:05] right don't you in other words they send
[26:07] you shut up don't think that's an
[26:08] example same thing right
[26:11] don't speak it'll be given to you you
[26:14] can't build yourself up you can't eat
[26:16] the right food you can't store it
[26:18] because it's a slight grow the women now
[26:20] we're talking heat uh and you'll know it
[26:24] if you have a new car you'll be going
[26:26] down the road an OnStar calls you
[26:28] well that speaker's on yeah
[26:31] I mean they're supposed to cut it on and
[26:33] cut it off
[26:35] but this woman calls you and says it's
[26:37] time for an oil change Mr Dale
[26:39] and you're looking around you know and
[26:41] you wonder where that come from when
[26:42] she's doing it from a satellite which
[26:44] they can leave the microphones only look
[26:46] at now how many video they are how many
[26:48] cameras
[26:50] have you ever looked on a Walmart
[26:52] call them black balls
[26:54] look no look on the outside when you
[26:58] walk into Walmart just look up there's
[27:00] probably 30 cameras that's right
[27:02] cornered in every direction yeah they
[27:05] have them on the streets now
[27:07] even in Gainesville there's there's a
[27:09] lot of cameras
[27:12] so what my point is we can't do enough
[27:17] to try to hide
[27:19] For What from what's coming that's right
[27:21] that's right we cannot do enough to hide
[27:23] from what's coming God's gonna have to
[27:25] do see because if it was anything man
[27:27] what God's doing he's bringing it down
[27:29] to a point where way down don't depend
[27:32] on way down anymore
[27:34] that's right because when when geeza and
[27:37] Elisha
[27:38] we're standing there in that host of 20
[27:40] something thousand people and Elisha
[27:43] says yeah he's a man there's more of us
[27:45] than they are them and he looks and goes
[27:47] one two one and two you're never gonna
[27:50] get any more than two but what did God
[27:52] what did Elijah say God opened by
[27:54] servant's eyes well he saw Chariots of
[27:56] Fire and angels
[27:59] well they were there the whole time
[28:02] but now what did Elisha do Elisha goes
[28:05] right into that camp of them people and
[28:08] says who are you looking for and they
[28:10] said well we're looking for Elisha
[28:12] he said well come on I'll show you where
[28:14] he's at well it was him
[28:16] God had changed their eyesight to where
[28:19] they didn't know who he was and remember
[28:21] he took him right down in the middle of
[28:23] the Syrian Army and God opened their
[28:25] eyes and they were just defeated they
[28:26] just laid their swords down they just
[28:28] and that's what's going to happen to us
[28:29] we cannot the only thing we can depend
[28:31] on is good enough of those virtues in as
[28:33] to where God can act
[28:35] and it not be us act it'll be God doing
[28:38] the acting not us doing the actor okay
[28:41] you understand what I'm saying because
[28:43] remember Jesus one time they had him
[28:45] back up on a cliff
[28:47] and then we're getting ready to Stony
[28:48] they were going to kill me the Bible
[28:49] says the Bible says he disappeared
[28:51] through the crowd all he done he just
[28:53] changed their eyesight and he just
[28:55] walked right through them and they never
[28:57] saw him but it was him walking in flesh
[29:00] walking right through that crowd and
[29:02] that's the only way that you and I are
[29:03] going to make it is God's gonna have to
[29:05] do it
[29:07] because remember brother Branson you
[29:08] can't make yourself have these virtues
[29:10] that's right you know you've got to but
[29:12] remember there's provision for you to
[29:14] get them
[29:15] and that's come to church reading Bible
[29:17] study pray get with somebody that's got
[29:20] the virtue see that's what I believe
[29:22] Peter James and John and all them they
[29:24] were in one central location but God
[29:26] wanted to get the word out
[29:28] and he knew if this
[29:31] two people over here had their own idea
[29:34] and they go off over here they'll and
[29:36] that's what happened they preach a
[29:37] different Doctrine but God brought
[29:39] everything Central Peter James and John
[29:42] all the ones were ahead of them of the
[29:44] first church
[29:46] Paul was included later but Paul wasn't
[29:48] really included in this yet
[29:50] okay it was Peter James and John because
[29:53] Paul hadn't been converted yet but in
[29:56] that central location God said okay
[29:57] we're going to send you out
[30:00] into these different areas and but
[30:02] you're going to take this gospel
[30:04] and we're going to provide the funds for
[30:06] you to go and that's how it worked
[30:08] because you know what gospel got out
[30:10] somehow
[30:12] but see Jesus though speaking right here
[30:14] at the end of his life on Earth
[30:16] he said to love him anyway it's cold
[30:19] showing that in the beginning of time in
[30:22] the beginning of the Christian church
[30:23] that brotherly the Brotherhood
[30:26] so there and everything in common
[30:29] but now at the end time Satan's going to
[30:31] take all that away or try to take it all
[30:34] away
[30:35] in brotherly kindness
[30:38] Jesus said this this will all man know
[30:45] when you have love
[30:47] one for another
[30:49] one for the other Pentecost had it I'm
[30:52] speaking Pentecost meaning the first
[30:54] group of Apostles and disciples they had
[30:56] that Brotherly Love they wasn't greedy
[31:01] they sold everything they had for the
[31:04] furthering of the church
[31:06] they were so together till even one
[31:08] heard of the other one died and they
[31:10] said let us go and die with it that's
[31:13] the attitude of that first church now
[31:15] listen if it's the attitude of the first
[31:17] church it's got to be the attitude of
[31:19] the last Church
[31:21] can't hold anything different can't hold
[31:23] anything back let's go ahead and go up
[31:25] front that way
[31:27] have some time to get everything ready
[31:30] pray for us doing all the cooking and
[31:32] all and your sisters enjoy
