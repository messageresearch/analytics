[2:59] amen you want to see him turn around
[3:01] look at each other and there's where god
[3:03] is today
[3:05] he's right here not just among his
[3:06] people he's in his people
[3:09] and he's a wonderful
[3:13] wonderful friend
[3:16] all the different titles we can give him
[3:20] but daddy our papa god our father
[3:24] kind of brings it on home you know he's
[3:26] a lot of different things he's
[3:27] he's a rose of sharon he's lily of the
[3:29] valley bright morning star
[3:32] he's all the different things but he is
[3:35] our
[3:35] father hey man good to be in the house
[3:37] with lord good to be here got a good
[3:39] crowd up here and i know there's a
[3:40] little bit of a crowd downstairs
[3:42] that's good maybe we'll get them all
[3:44] back together
[3:45] one day brother dardy and we can all
[3:48] worship
[3:50] in the same room but we all worship the
[3:52] same god it doesn't matter where we're
[3:54] at
[3:54] so uh god bless you uh if you got your
[3:57] bibles let's turn
[3:58] to first john 4 let's continue on the
[4:01] two spirits
[4:02] today we're going to speak on uh
[4:06] if you bring the two spirits in you've
[4:07] got to go back to the garden of eden as
[4:09] we were
[4:10] with satan and our lucifer and and
[4:13] god and then also you got to bring in
[4:16] adam and eve
[4:18] and you got to see that it's like
[4:20] brother dale's talking about but
[4:22] you got to see the transition because
[4:25] god started out everything spiritual
[4:29] and then it it it transmitted down to
[4:32] natural
[4:33] all right so we've got a natural body in
[4:37] the spiritual body as we're talking
[4:38] about there in the corinthians
[4:40] we'll get to that maybe later on today
[4:42] if not that's okay
[4:44] but there was a spiritual man made first
[4:48] then there was a natural man made and
[4:50] during the time of that making of the
[4:51] natural man
[4:53] is where we see the fall come in and
[4:55] then we see two different
[4:57] seeds are two different not
[5:00] lines of lineage but we do see it begin
[5:04] as two lines of lineage and we'll cover
[5:06] that
[5:07] today because the bible tells us that
[5:09] adam
[5:10] didn't say adam was the father of all
[5:12] living
[5:14] it said eve was the mother of all living
[5:17] so there's a there's a revelation in
[5:19] there that there must been a
[5:21] a seed of discrepancy come in i listened
[5:23] to that message a couple of nights ago
[5:25] and that's really good it's a short
[5:26] message but boy it was really powerful
[5:28] on the seat of discrepancy there in
[5:30] arizona but that seed of discrepancy
[5:32] came in and
[5:34] and remember too it's not so much and
[5:36] we'll read it maybe
[5:37] later on it's not so much as the natural
[5:40] seed that got planted it was the
[5:41] spiritual seed that got planted in
[5:43] the mine first because everything has to
[5:45] start up here
[5:47] you've got to be contacted up here this
[5:49] is where
[5:51] everything's got to start from
[5:54] you can accept or reject from right here
[5:57] and then your body just what your body
[5:59] just manifests what you're thinking
[6:00] amen that's why the bible tells us you
[6:03] know if
[6:04] we should have the mind of christ well
[6:05] if you have the mind of christ then you
[6:06] should act like him
[6:09] okay we didn't get a brain transfer but
[6:11] we do have the mind of christ in our
[6:13] soul
[6:14] by the new birth all right so everybody
[6:16] cool and good
[6:17] remember brother chris long will be your
[6:19] wednesday that was a good surprise that
[6:20] he's moving in he's preaching for
[6:21] brother jewell today
[6:23] at the new church so just pray for him
[6:25] he'll be here in a few days
[6:27] and be speaking for us on wings tonight
[6:28] so other than that i don't think there's
[6:30] any new announcements
[6:33] other than just pray for everybody you
[6:35] see the prayer list or
[6:36] continuing to get longer um
[6:40] and it's it's just the devil so we just
[6:44] we just don't um we don't believe that
[6:48] he's stronger than we are
[6:51] he is not there's no weapon formed the
[6:54] scripture tells us this is going to take
[6:56] us down unless god wants us to leave and
[6:58] when god's ready for us to leave
[7:01] time to go amen all right if you're a
[7:04] christian
[7:04] if you're not a christian you better be
[7:06] careful when you say that
[7:08] you don't know where you're going but we
[7:10] as believers know where we're going
[7:12] amen so the lord bless you and be with
[7:15] you keep us all in your prayers
[7:17] as we continue on this two spirits
[7:21] coming down from all the way from the
[7:23] beginning back before
[7:25] the beginning all the way down to now so
[7:27] first john 4 verse 1
[7:29] let's bow our heads dear lord jesus
[7:31] thank you for this day that you've given
[7:33] us
[7:34] thanks for the time and fellowship we've
[7:35] had today lord now pray that we now
[7:37] would
[7:38] focus our attention to fellowship around
[7:39] the word of god
[7:41] focus around the anointing that's here
[7:43] lord the true anointing that come to
[7:45] anoint the word
[7:47] lord as we speak father may you anoint
[7:49] the people to hear
[7:51] songs have been sung all the things
[7:53] ordinances of the church has been done
[7:55] now we've come to this place lord where
[7:57] you speak to us
[7:59] father we pray that you just be with the
[8:00] ones that are sick we know many ones
[8:02] brother claude says
[8:03] george jackson the different ones that
[8:06] lord we've
[8:07] been in contact with just having a hard
[8:09] time father but
[8:10] we know that greater is he that's in us
[8:12] than he that's in the world
[8:14] and we pray that you would send that
[8:15] anointing to them father
[8:17] and that you would heal them and touch
[8:18] them today father
[8:20] forgive us of our sins bless us and
[8:23] guide us by your holy spirit
[8:25] give us this day our daily bread and
[8:28] forgive us of our trespasses lord we
[8:29] pray in jesus name
[8:31] amen all right this would be part six
[8:34] we're going to talk a little bit about
[8:35] adam and eve and how that got started
[8:39] i know we all pretty much in this
[8:41] building know that
[8:44] right up front it wasn't an apple that
[8:46] eve ate and gave it to
[8:48] to uh to adam or pomegranate or any kind
[8:53] of fruit
[8:55] if not then we need to start eating
[8:57] fruit again because it's totally it
[8:58] showed that they were naked
[9:01] and we need to start eating apples again
[9:02] i guess to show that we're naked because
[9:04] of people taking off clothes more now
[9:05] than they ever have
[9:07] so i i don't think that's what it was i
[9:11] think that we
[9:11] we're going as we go through this you
[9:13] know as well as i do
[9:15] that it was hid from the eyes of the
[9:17] wise and prudent
[9:19] and revealed and to babe such it would
[9:21] learn such as would learn it's
[9:22] it's been hidden from centuries and
[9:25] generations
[9:26] and now was revealed not only just in
[9:29] the end time i
[9:30] i i'm like brother dale i think the even
[9:33] the pharisees in the
[9:34] old testament coming they were in the
[9:36] old testament you know jesus was in the
[9:38] old testament
[9:39] okay new testament didn't start till the
[9:41] day of pentecost
[9:42] so they were they knew that they knew
[9:44] what happened in the garden they knew
[9:45] there wasn't
[9:46] wasn't an apple or a pomegranate or in
[9:49] other words why did
[9:50] if it was an apple or an orange or
[9:52] something why didn't if that was the
[9:54] shame that was caused in the garden
[9:56] why didn't they make glove fig leave
[9:58] gloves as brother ernie says and why
[10:00] didn't they cover their mouth with a
[10:01] with a fig leaf no they covered them
[10:03] other parts
[10:05] with a fig leaf because they knew what
[10:07] they had done
[10:08] and it wasn't uh the way god wanted
[10:10] because remember
[10:11] we talked the other day about spoken
[10:13] word seed the only
[10:15] the only person in the whole entire
[10:18] universe that can speak
[10:20] a word and it come to pass directly as
[10:24] he thought it is god almighty
[10:27] satan cannot do that you and i can't do
[10:29] that
[10:30] but the word of god can do that the
[10:32] creator that stood and said let there be
[10:35] it had to happen all right and it had to
[10:37] happen the way he said it would happen
[10:39] so when he said every seed would bring
[10:41] forth of its kind
[10:42] he meant what he said and he said what
[10:44] he meant all right so now look
[10:46] now we go on now we're already now in
[10:48] the new testament and here's the little
[10:50] john's
[10:51] by john the revelator telling us here
[10:54] beloved believe not every spirit but try
[10:56] the spirits whether they are of god
[10:59] because many false prophets are going
[11:01] out into the world hereby know you the
[11:03] spirit of god
[11:04] every spirit that confesses that jesus
[11:06] christ has come in the flesh
[11:08] is of god and many times i've said
[11:09] before that doesn't mean a drunk on the
[11:11] side of the road
[11:12] you say do you believe jesus christ has
[11:14] come in the flesh and he goes yeah
[11:16] that don't mean he's safe amen
[11:19] that confesseth in other words your
[11:21] confession your daily walk your
[11:23] your what you say the things that even
[11:25] your thoughts
[11:27] should be pure and every spirit that
[11:28] confesses not that jesus christ has come
[11:30] in the flesh is not of god
[11:32] and this is that spirit of antichrist
[11:34] where have you ever heard that it should
[11:35] come and even now already as in the
[11:37] world that was in 1896
[11:39] ye are of god little children have
[11:41] overcome them because greater is he thus
[11:43] in you
[11:44] than he that's in the world they are of
[11:46] the world therefore speak they of the
[11:47] world and the world heareth them
[11:49] you know that's why just for a minute
[11:52] while you're standing it keeps you awake
[11:54] longer
[11:56] that's why that we should not look like
[11:58] the world
[12:01] that's what it tells us right here we
[12:03] should not look like the world
[12:06] we have to mingle with the world we have
[12:08] to go to
[12:09] walmart and we have to go to these
[12:11] different places and
[12:12] but we i want them to know that we're
[12:15] different
[12:16] and the only way they're going to know
[12:18] that we're different is is by our
[12:19] actions reactions what we do what we
[12:21] wear what we listen to amen
[12:25] that's the only way they can tell any
[12:26] difference now maybe with your sister's
[12:28] a little bit different because you don't
[12:29] cut your hair
[12:30] as the bible tells you not to and
[12:32] doesn't wear pants as the bible tells
[12:33] you not to
[12:34] but that's what the bible is telling us
[12:36] he said
[12:37] look we're not segregationalists
[12:41] but god is a segregationalist
[12:44] he told israel he said don't you marry
[12:46] those people
[12:47] right keep your lying pure don't you do
[12:49] that now what does he tell us here
[12:51] in the spiritual in paul and john and
[12:54] all the different ones
[12:55] he says don't partake of the world
[12:58] don't do what the world does if you do
[13:00] what the world does you're of the world
[13:02] okay but we want to be called out of
[13:05] that and be separated from the world
[13:08] because you know what the world the
[13:10] world mammon the world
[13:12] mammon does not have god in it
[13:16] god is only he's not in trees he's not
[13:18] in houses he's not in buildings
[13:20] he's in people he's either in you or not
[13:23] in you there's no
[13:24] gray area no halfway there no
[13:28] amen they are of the world therefore
[13:30] speak they of the world and the world
[13:31] heareth them
[13:33] we are of god he that knoweth god
[13:34] heareth us and he that is not of god
[13:37] heareth not us hereby know we the spirit
[13:39] of truth
[13:40] now there's your one spirit and the
[13:42] spirit of error there's your other
[13:43] spirit all right you may be seated in
[13:45] the lord that is blessing
[13:46] to the reading the word we're going to
[13:48] fly through this pretty quick at first
[13:50] and get in back into the book of genesis
[13:52] because i want to bring some things out
[13:53] here
[13:54] is that okay ezekiel 28 verse 11.
[14:00] you have to excuse me moreover the word
[14:02] of the lord came unto me saying
[14:04] son of man take up a lamentation upon
[14:06] the king of tirus and say unto him
[14:08] thus saith the lord god thou sealeth up
[14:10] to some full of wisdom
[14:12] and perfect in beauty now who's he
[14:13] talking about he's talking about the
[14:15] devil
[14:16] or lucifer all right lucifer was created
[14:20] first he was created beautiful he was
[14:22] not created
[14:22] ugly he was created perfect
[14:26] amen all right thou hast been in eden
[14:28] the garden of god now there's your key
[14:32] because we're going to put him directly
[14:34] into the garden of eden
[14:36] and show how this thing happened called
[14:38] the fall
[14:40] and it wasn't that he brought even apple
[14:43] and the tree of life is not a literal
[14:45] tree
[14:46] and the tree of knowledge and good and
[14:47] evil is not a literal tree
[14:49] okay it's the two spirits that we're
[14:51] talking about all right it's
[14:53] it's the two things that god said you
[14:56] can eat this one and live or you can eat
[14:57] this one and die
[14:58] right all right there is no tree that
[15:01] you can eat now
[15:03] and live forever and there is no tree
[15:06] now there may be a tree that you can eat
[15:08] that poisons you and kills you
[15:09] but that's in the natural but when you i
[15:11] want you to see this we'll look at in
[15:13] the garden
[15:14] i want to show you something about a
[15:16] little um
[15:18] a punctuation mark or or something
[15:21] that'll tell us the
[15:23] kind of the story and i know i'm not a
[15:25] english major
[15:27] but i do know a little bit about english
[15:29] but look at that word right there says
[15:30] thou has been
[15:31] eaten the garden of god you see that
[15:33] that's called a semicolon
[15:35] everybody see that i just looked it up
[15:38] it's got to be the truth
[15:40] i just looked it up on the internet
[15:43] right in there
[15:44] that evil thing called a semicolon it's
[15:47] used to connect
[15:48] independent clauses it's not a period
[15:50] and start over again it
[15:52] it connects in that right night line
[15:54] neither shaking the head uh-huh she's
[15:56] been
[15:56] she's been an english class you have not
[15:58] slept in the english class
[16:00] so thou has been in eden in the garden
[16:02] of god semicolon now if
[16:05] this is connecting it together but it's
[16:07] not starting a new
[16:10] sentence it says it's telling what he is
[16:12] every precious stone was not covering
[16:14] the stardust topaz the diamond barrel
[16:16] onyx the remember the comma is ongoing
[16:18] jasper sapphire emerald carbuncle and
[16:20] gold
[16:22] the workmanship of thy tablets and thy
[16:25] pipes were prepared and then the day
[16:26] that thou was created so when no one
[16:28] thinks for sure god created lucifer
[16:32] god created the devil all right he
[16:34] didn't create him the devil he
[16:36] created him lucifer the anointed cherub
[16:38] the one to stand by his side
[16:40] the one to be anointed to to be
[16:43] god's right-hand man wow what about that
[16:48] well he had to come from somewhere and
[16:50] if all life comes from god then god had
[16:52] to give him that life but
[16:53] listen that life that satan had is just
[16:56] the same life as me and you have and the
[16:58] point is you and i have a
[17:01] choice to make between doing right with
[17:03] it or wrong with it he had the same
[17:04] choice
[17:05] to do right with it to do wrong with it
[17:07] all right because he give cain the same
[17:09] thing he gave all of us the same choice
[17:11] even as i read the quotes from brother
[17:12] brown said all the angels
[17:15] were give were given a choice
[17:18] because part of them went with satan so
[17:21] obviously they had a choice because god
[17:22] didn't create all them bad angels
[17:25] he created angels and they became bad
[17:29] as they go along and start listening to
[17:31] what satan had to say listen
[17:32] satan is the slickest character you'll
[17:36] ever meet you'll never meet
[17:39] nobody more deceiving
[17:43] than the devil listen god almighty will
[17:47] never deceive you
[17:49] never he will never give you a deception
[17:53] because he's truth and he's all truth
[17:55] and he's the only truth
[17:56] but satan as he opens his mouth
[18:00] he's a deceiver he's going to try to
[18:03] trip you up he's going to try to deceive
[18:05] you
[18:05] because he is of that other spirit all
[18:08] right
[18:09] everybody got that say amen satan is not
[18:13] your friend
[18:15] he's not your companion though he may be
[18:17] closer to you than
[18:19] than god is most of the time i don't
[18:21] know about you but
[18:22] he is with me but the bible tells us to
[18:26] resist the devil and they'll flee from
[18:27] you that's that's pretty that's really
[18:29] hard to do
[18:31] sometimes it is hard to do but it's the
[18:33] easiest thing in the world to do
[18:35] so let's go to genesis 1 26 and read
[18:37] this because this is what we're going to
[18:40] get to today and and listen everybody
[18:43] that's sitting in this building except
[18:44] for a few have known that we preached on
[18:46] genesis 1 26
[18:48] for years it's my favorite scripture in
[18:49] the bible because it tells
[18:51] me of me
[18:55] that's not every human being
[18:58] no that's not every human being that was
[19:01] ever created
[19:02] that is a special group of people that
[19:05] came out of god
[19:06] the children of god the one he has that
[19:09] portrait album of
[19:10] before the foundation of the world that
[19:13] is not
[19:17] i'm trying to say this that's not
[19:19] sinners
[19:20] that's not this is this is a special
[19:23] brother dale
[19:24] said this morning exactly what i was
[19:26] going to tell you genesis 1 26
[19:28] is a special designation of god
[19:33] it's not another god that's right right
[19:35] it's an
[19:36] extension or a manifestation of that
[19:38] same god or you've got
[19:40] back to your trinitarian doctrine of
[19:42] three persons in a trinity
[19:44] which is not not even in the bible and
[19:47] god said
[19:48] let us make man in our image after our
[19:51] likeness so
[19:52] whatever he made that person you might
[19:55] want to say
[19:56] it can't be another person but that
[19:58] being whatever he made it was him it was
[20:00] like him
[20:02] looked like him acted like him and they
[20:06] have a dominion
[20:07] over the fish of the sea and the fowl of
[20:09] the air so they have a dominion
[20:11] over the cattle and over all the earth
[20:14] all the earth
[20:15] all the earth and over every creeping
[20:18] thing that creepeth upon the earth so
[20:20] god created man now remember that word
[20:22] created just
[20:23] flying through what we spoke of many
[20:25] years ago brother dale spoke of it many
[20:27] years before i did
[20:29] so god created that word created is not
[20:31] there was nothing and then there's
[20:32] something
[20:34] right right that word created means
[20:36] formed
[20:37] all right so he formed a man in his own
[20:40] image in the image of god create how did
[20:42] he form him
[20:43] he formed him by the word he fought he
[20:45] formed him by that spoken word seed that
[20:48] we're talking about
[20:50] that we've been talking about i was
[20:52] reading the other day and brother ryan
[20:53] was telling us he said
[20:54] the first the first adam was a spoken
[20:57] seed word
[20:59] the second adam was a spoken seed word
[21:03] god came down and put the egg and the
[21:06] and the germ
[21:06] inside of mary and came forth jesus
[21:09] christ
[21:10] the beginning of the creation of god the
[21:12] way that it should have been had there
[21:14] not been a fall
[21:16] and we're going to find that out because
[21:18] it's going to reverse back to where you
[21:20] and i
[21:20] now are spoken word seed children but we
[21:22] had to come by that desire of a man and
[21:25] a woman
[21:28] that's what i was telling you a long
[21:29] time ago i don't care who you are how
[21:31] much money you make how good looking or
[21:33] how ugly you are we all came from the
[21:35] same act
[21:37] every one of us bar none we all came
[21:40] from that same act
[21:41] because of what happened in the garden
[21:42] so don't tell me it was
[21:44] uh well now bob black now he eat bananas
[21:47] and
[21:48] and had them children and i eat
[21:52] grapes and i had mine
[21:56] kind of foolish isn't it well that's how
[21:58] we think when we think that what
[21:59] happened in the garden had to do with
[22:01] natural fruit amen
[22:05] don't fall asleep on me so god created
[22:08] man in his own image and the image of
[22:10] god created him
[22:11] so whatever it was this was a god man
[22:15] a god man male and female
[22:19] created he them and god blessed them
[22:22] listen before you even came on the face
[22:25] of the earth you're blessed
[22:28] and god said to them be fruitful and
[22:29] multiply oh now brother way that means
[22:31] that you're going to
[22:32] y'all going to start having children no
[22:33] that means one thing's for sure
[22:36] that having natural children is the only
[22:38] way we can get here now because
[22:40] of what happened in the fall but by
[22:42] spiritual birth
[22:44] we are being fruitful and multiplying
[22:46] now by spiritual multiplication brother
[22:48] dale started this church with 12 people
[22:50] now there's been hundreds you say
[22:52] hundreds yeah there's been people moved
[22:53] through here and had other went to other
[22:55] churches there's been people come here
[22:57] and even created other churches all
[22:59] right from here so there to me is the
[23:01] spiritual multiplication that's when
[23:03] jesus was telling the people that i'm
[23:05] going to come back
[23:07] and i'm not going to be just with you
[23:08] i'm going to be in you
[23:10] all right so by spiritual multiplication
[23:12] he is absolutely fulfilling genesis 1
[23:16] 26-28 that's why i love it because
[23:18] listen that's god's children
[23:20] that's not the children of the devil
[23:22] that's not the foolish virgin that's not
[23:24] that is the children of almighty god
[23:27] because they are an extension of him
[23:29] they are actually they have his dna
[23:35] when you get born again your dna is the
[23:38] dna of almighty god
[23:40] in your soul but your mama and daddy had
[23:42] to get you here by natural dna that's
[23:44] why i said there's a natural seed and a
[23:46] spiritual seed
[23:47] all right so now we're going to take
[23:51] that back to the garden because they're
[23:52] in the beginning all right and god
[23:55] blessed them and said unto them be
[23:56] fruitful
[23:57] and multiply and replenish the earth and
[24:00] subdue it
[24:01] and have dominion over the fish of the
[24:03] sea and over the fowl of the air and
[24:04] over every living thing
[24:06] that moveth upon the earth in other
[24:07] words god said hey
[24:10] y'all take care of the earth i'll take
[24:12] care of heaven
[24:14] i'm going to give you dominion over the
[24:15] fish of the sea and the fowl of the air
[24:17] so it had to be the earth it couldn't
[24:18] have been somewhere else like mars or
[24:19] venus or anything like that it had to be
[24:21] the earth
[24:21] he gave us he gave dominion to this
[24:26] group of people but now remember this
[24:28] group of people
[24:30] were are going to come in continuance
[24:33] if there had not been a fall we would
[24:35] have all been in the garden of eden but
[24:37] you know what
[24:39] god's got an attribute called savior
[24:42] god's got an attribute called healer
[24:46] god's got a rose of sharon lily of the
[24:48] valley the
[24:49] the balm in gilead that is inside of god
[24:52] and he had to get those attributes out
[24:54] and to get those attributes out
[24:55] he had to allow
[24:58] sin to enter the picture
[25:02] that's why you say oh now well now god
[25:04] he created a lucifer just for that
[25:06] purpose
[25:06] no he created loose for perfect what the
[25:09] bible says
[25:12] satan is the one lucifer is the one that
[25:14] that turned the table and he's the one
[25:15] that got all the evil
[25:17] he didn't get that from god because
[25:19] we're going to see here in a minute even
[25:20] in a natural setting
[25:23] but just really i want you to be careful
[25:25] when we start into this because
[25:26] in the beginning there was two seed
[25:29] lines
[25:31] i said in the beginning but we're going
[25:34] to prove either today or next week
[25:36] that that thing got so mingled even the
[25:38] tower of babel god just confused
[25:40] everybody sent
[25:41] part of the people this way part of them
[25:43] this one so you can't
[25:44] when the bible says the sons of god came
[25:46] and saw the daughters of men
[25:47] and started mingling you can't find a
[25:50] seed line anywhere it's just all corrupt
[25:53] the prophet of god tells us if i have
[25:54] time i read it that adam's seed
[25:57] literally polluted this whole earth
[26:00] because remember a woman doesn't have a
[26:02] seed a woman has to receive seed
[26:05] everybody got that we know that for a
[26:06] fact a woman has to receive seed because
[26:09] that's what we're going to read
[26:10] in the garden maybe well we won't get to
[26:12] genesis 3 today maybe but in genesis 3
[26:14] god says i'll put enmity between thy
[26:16] seed and the seed of the woman
[26:18] all right so remember we have to receive
[26:22] the seed word of god to be children of
[26:25] god
[26:26] you don't just come here with it it's
[26:27] not just automatic it's not just you're
[26:28] born with it
[26:30] you have to receive it all right so that
[26:32] genesis 1 26
[26:34] whatever that is to me i'm just telling
[26:37] you that is the children of almighty god
[26:39] that
[26:39] is what god that's what satan can't
[26:43] he can't understand that right this is
[26:45] one
[26:46] part of the scripture that satan cannot
[26:48] understand
[26:49] is how god can divide himself into a
[26:52] multiple form
[26:53] called a bride and still be one person
[26:58] because we're going to find out in a
[26:59] minute if we're a type if the bride
[27:01] and christ is a type of a natural bride
[27:04] adam and eve the bible tells us that she
[27:07] was
[27:08] born of his bone and flesh of his flesh
[27:11] now
[27:12] june and i have been married 41 years
[27:13] and there she's not bone in my bone
[27:15] because she has a different dna because
[27:17] of what happened in the fall
[27:18] but now literally adam and eve
[27:22] if you were to take them today and bring
[27:24] them down here and put them in a
[27:25] a lab
[27:30] you take them to a scientist and a
[27:31] scientist says there's no way these two
[27:33] people can have the same dna
[27:35] but they did because the rib came out
[27:38] and he formed a woman
[27:41] amen so they were literally when adam
[27:44] said she is bone of my bone and flesh in
[27:46] my flesh
[27:46] well by the power of transformation
[27:48] that's another good
[27:50] sermon for you to listen to by the power
[27:51] of transformation by the power of god
[27:54] that released right here
[27:58] you and i are one with him bone of his
[28:02] bone
[28:03] and flesh of his flesh amen by the
[28:06] baptism of the holy ghost you and i are
[28:08] changed into the image
[28:10] of almighty god amen all right
[28:13] exposition of the seven church ages this
[28:14] is what the quote i'm gonna read every
[28:16] time
[28:17] so you just get used to it see if you
[28:19] can memorize it now remember this christ
[28:21] in the true church
[28:22] now this now listen there's false church
[28:24] and there's true church but remember
[28:25] it's two churches
[28:26] remember the two spirits we're talking
[28:28] about not evil so much
[28:30] as evil of as uh the world would call
[28:33] evil like we see murders and rapes and
[28:35] all these different things
[28:37] sure that is a manifestation of that
[28:39] other spirit but that's not that
[28:42] that's not that apex of that of that
[28:44] spirit
[28:46] the apex of that spirit is sitting here
[28:49] today
[28:51] the apex of satan's spirit is sitting
[28:53] here today not out there in the world
[28:55] amen he's trying to deceive us he's
[28:58] already got them
[29:00] he's trying to deceive the true bride
[29:02] because if she gets what the book of
[29:04] revelation shows how the antichrist
[29:06] spirit would come into the church
[29:07] defile it make it lukewarm formal and
[29:09] powerless
[29:10] it exposes satan revealing his works
[29:13] attempt the destruction of god's people
[29:15] see that's why you see that genesis 1 26
[29:17] man satan is not trying to
[29:19] destroy nobody but that whoever that was
[29:22] god's talking about
[29:26] he knows if he gets them
[29:30] he's got god right because they're a
[29:32] part of god
[29:34] and they're so secret that satan can't
[29:35] understand satan can't understand the
[29:37] new birth you receive saint can i
[29:38] understand
[29:39] why that zach black two days before he
[29:42] got born again was
[29:44] xyz i don't drinking smoking cussing
[29:47] gambling you won't do that but whatever
[29:49] and then all of a sudden two days later
[29:51] you know you give your heart to the lord
[29:52] everything's cleaned out
[29:54] and satan comes back in and goes and
[30:02] and bro zach opens the door and goes
[30:04] it's full in here
[30:06] shuts the door back it's full of the
[30:09] holy ghost in here
[30:10] and satan sees a power and feels a power
[30:13] that he's never felt before
[30:15] so you know what he does he said uh he's
[30:17] not gonna quit
[30:19] satan's not a quitter no he's going to
[30:22] go
[30:22] oh you got a spirit you got memory
[30:25] reason and conscious affection we're
[30:27] going to get into this because this is
[30:28] how slick he was to eve
[30:30] he couldn't get to eve's soul he
[30:31] couldn't blacken her soul
[30:34] because she was part of that genesis 1
[30:35] 26 man male and female
[30:38] hey wake up goodness gracious
[30:41] 15 minutes come on maybe if we were
[30:44] playing clemson and georgia we're
[30:45] playing we'd
[30:48] anyway but you got a different spirit
[30:51] that you're dealing with now
[30:55] and satan can only go to that second
[30:57] realm
[30:59] remember he can't even go to the first
[31:00] round that's me
[31:02] that's that's see tastes phil smelling
[31:04] here
[31:05] that only reacts to what that second
[31:08] person is
[31:09] or that third person is or the third
[31:12] third realm not person you don't have me
[31:14] if you're have many persons you got a
[31:16] problem you're a little bit
[31:16] schizophrenic
[31:19] but but satan can't understand that how
[31:21] he can't get back in there now and he
[31:22] how that he he motivates you by the same
[31:25] thing he started to motivate you before
[31:27] and it don't work right that's right
[31:29] because all of satan's subjects he's
[31:31] like drink some more
[31:32] and they go okay ain't no problem let's
[31:33] go to the beer joint
[31:35] look zach let's drink some more i don't
[31:37] do it anymore
[31:38] huh you don't do that anymore
[31:42] how'd that happen it's a miracle
[31:47] that's a miracle because we're going to
[31:49] show you here in just a few minutes
[31:51] and the longer y'all sleep the longer
[31:53] i'm going to preach
[31:56] trust me
[32:02] okay so get rested up real good and
[32:05] sleep a little while we'll do this in
[32:06] intervals
[32:10] because look when we get to the garden
[32:12] of eden
[32:13] satan didn't come in and say there is no
[32:16] god
[32:17] he's a liar ah
[32:20] he walks in and he puts one word
[32:23] [Music]
[32:25] god said the day you eat thereof i've
[32:27] got it written here we'll see it
[32:29] that day you die
[32:33] that day you'll surely die all satan
[32:36] done has come in and said
[32:38] thou she
[32:41] waited she said she said no of every
[32:43] tree we can eat and all this stuff we'll
[32:44] get to in a minute
[32:45] but he says you won't surely
[32:49] you'll not not you'll not surely die all
[32:52] he put was not in there
[32:54] he said everything god said except one
[32:56] word
[32:57] one word he didn't deny that there
[33:00] wasn't a god he didn't deny that
[33:02] that eve was a child of god he didn't
[33:04] deny that
[33:05] no he was just telling him what he what
[33:07] god had already said multiplying
[33:08] replenishing here
[33:11] all right so anyway so he knows that if
[33:12] the people get the true revelation
[33:14] that's what we're trying now we're
[33:15] trying to get the true revelation
[33:17] of the true church and what she is and
[33:19] what she stands for
[33:21] see we got to know where we come from
[33:24] know what we're doing here and know
[33:25] where we're going if we know we came
[33:27] from that genesis 1 26 man
[33:29] we cannot lose
[33:32] we've already won he has preserved that
[33:35] i'll clap he has preserved that
[33:38] satan can't bother it oh he bombed
[33:42] you say oh satan don't bother you he
[33:43] can't bother that inside guy
[33:47] your soul it is well with my soul i love
[33:50] that song
[33:51] thank you brother michael it could be
[33:53] well with your soul and all hell
[33:54] breaking loose everywhere else
[33:57] but it can be well with your soul what
[33:59] about a man that lost all of his kids
[34:00] and
[34:01] and and his wife says everything's okay
[34:06] and he and he goes across and goes
[34:08] across the same place where the
[34:10] where the place sunk where he lost his
[34:12] kids and and writes that song
[34:16] most of us would go crazy but he said
[34:20] when peace like a river
[34:24] i tend this my way when sorrows like
[34:28] seas but will troll
[34:30] whatever my lot i'm here to say
[34:34] it as well with this guy down inside
[34:37] here oh he probably cried nights and he
[34:39] probably cried over
[34:40] the grave and all the different things
[34:42] but you know there was one thing inside
[34:43] of him look at what he pinned he pinned
[34:45] that thing all the way down to the
[34:46] change of the body
[34:49] about the trump and the shout and the
[34:50] voice he had a revelation
[34:54] because he knows he's coming back if
[34:55] he's born again he knows he's coming
[34:57] back he knows he's getting his kids back
[34:58] he knows he's getting his wife back
[35:00] everything's coming right back to what
[35:02] that garden of eden condition
[35:04] so that's what we're doing what she
[35:05] stands for and that she can do the
[35:06] greater work she will be an invincible
[35:08] army
[35:09] if they get a true revelation of what
[35:10] the two spirits within the framework of
[35:13] the christian church
[35:14] so now today we're going to talk about
[35:16] the christian church but it's going to
[35:17] be called the garden of eden
[35:20] everybody they'll be okay with that
[35:23] that's going to be the garden of eden is
[35:25] going to be the christian church
[35:27] that we're talking about today and by
[35:30] god's spirit discern and withstand the
[35:31] antichrist spirit satan will be
[35:33] powerless
[35:34] before her all right let's read number
[35:36] two greatest battle ever fought
[35:38] this great first battle that was ever
[35:39] fought began in heaven when michael and
[35:41] his angels fought against lucifer and
[35:42] his angel
[35:43] it first started the first battle within
[35:45] heaven so sin did not originate in
[35:47] heaven it originated on earth so
[35:49] remember
[35:50] sin originated in the spirit realm first
[35:58] not the act in the garden
[36:01] no it started before the foundation of
[36:03] the world
[36:04] when lucifer preached to his art
[36:08] angels or two angels that believed him
[36:10] and
[36:11] michael preached to his listen they
[36:12] weren't up there having to knock down
[36:13] dragon
[36:15] no they were fighting words all right
[36:18] they were fighting spirits were fighting
[36:20] each other they weren't up there
[36:21] whoever's the
[36:22] you know whoever's the strongest we knew
[36:24] who the strongest was satan just gave up
[36:26] and said okay i'm going to try to
[36:28] deceive this bunch over here and i'll
[36:29] take them with me and they did
[36:32] so the first battle was in heaven then
[36:34] it was thrown down from heaven cast out
[36:35] of heaven to the earth
[36:37] and fell on human beings then the battle
[36:39] from angels became human battles
[36:41] and satan what come to destroy god's
[36:44] creation
[36:45] amen what god had created to be for
[36:49] himself
[36:51] because remember oh listen all the
[36:53] original creation
[36:54] why do we call it why do we call it a
[36:57] fall
[36:59] because we fell from something amen
[37:01] right
[37:02] yeah pretty simple
[37:05] fall the garden happened the fall but
[37:09] what happened before that
[37:10] peace joy love
[37:15] harmony god and man talking together
[37:19] lip to ear face to face isn't that what
[37:22] we're going back to
[37:24] that's what we're heading toward all
[37:26] satan done was put a gap
[37:27] in there for for god to display his
[37:30] attribute of savior and healer and
[37:31] redeemer
[37:33] and then it's going to close right back
[37:34] up and we're going to go right back into
[37:36] an eden again
[37:39] so satan come to destroy this that's
[37:41] what his purpose was was to destroy it
[37:44] then the battle began here on earth
[37:46] began where
[37:47] in us and has been raging
[37:50] ever since all right
[37:54] now let's go and read this quote and
[37:55] then we'll start right here we'll go
[37:56] back to the bible
[37:58] we're going to do everything in the
[37:59] bible today the expedition the seven
[38:00] church ages can you see past me
[38:03] i know i'm losing a little bit of weight
[38:04] so you can see a little bit better
[38:09] i'm i'm watching i've been watching my
[38:10] weight for years now i'm doing weight
[38:12] watchers it's just a play on words you
[38:13] know so
[38:15] did you get it now there are these twins
[38:17] again now remember there's always two
[38:19] always twins there are these two
[38:22] trees again growing side by side in the
[38:26] same earth
[38:27] partaking of the same nourishment
[38:29] drinking in the same rain the bible
[38:31] tells us you know the rain falls on the
[38:33] just and the unjust
[38:34] the rain listen the rain i hate it
[38:37] though but the rain falls on
[38:38] all my weed seed in my garden as much as
[38:41] it falls on my corn and beans and
[38:42] potatoes
[38:43] because trust me i've been down on my
[38:45] hands and knees this week
[38:46] digging them up but you know what they
[38:49] benefit from the same rain
[38:51] they benefit from the same sun but they
[38:53] come from different seeds
[38:56] one tree is for the word of god exactly
[38:59] as god
[39:00] give it that's the tree of life and
[39:02] loves and obeys it the other tree is
[39:04] from the seed that is
[39:05] anti the word and changes it where it
[39:08] wants to
[39:10] it substitutes its own creeds and dogmas
[39:13] for the living true word exactly as did
[39:16] cain
[39:17] who ended up killing abel but
[39:20] fear not little flocks stay with the
[39:22] word keep that word between you and the
[39:23] devil
[39:24] eve did not do that and she failed
[39:27] and when the church lets down on the
[39:29] word she goes into the depths of the
[39:30] darkness of satan
[39:32] wow what about that when the church lets
[39:35] it go
[39:36] now last week we were talking about
[39:38] right here the law of reproduction there
[39:40] is a law that god put into
[39:42] into motion and it's been that way ever
[39:44] since and it always will be that way
[39:46] you know but you know why that satan is
[39:48] so slick
[39:50] he was standing there watching this and
[39:52] he's like
[39:53] uh i think i figured out a way to get in
[39:55] here because remember satan doesn't have
[39:57] a seed he can't create
[40:00] he can only pervert so he perverts what
[40:02] god's already created
[40:04] everybody got that amen and god said now
[40:07] this is genesis
[40:08] 111 right at the beginning of the bible
[40:11] listen genesis is the seed chapter that
[40:13] everything that happens in
[40:15] in the whole world today came from the
[40:17] book of genesis
[40:18] and god said let the earth bring forth
[40:20] grass the herb yielding seed
[40:23] and the fruit tree yielding fruit after
[40:26] his kind
[40:28] whose seed is in itself we do not want
[40:30] to
[40:31] we're not deceived when we plant corn
[40:34] seed
[40:35] it looks like corn acts like corn when
[40:38] you plant it in the ground
[40:39] you're not expecting beans because
[40:42] every seed see we even know that when
[40:44] god put that in motion
[40:45] every how many thousands of years ago on
[40:48] the face of the earth he put that in
[40:49] motion and it is
[40:51] the only thing man has done is hybrid
[40:53] he's took and crossed it and all these
[40:54] different things
[40:55] that's why we're in such a bad shape
[40:57] that we're in
[40:58] we're not eating true seed but now
[41:00] remember all these seeds came from where
[41:03] spoken word of god every see
[41:06] everything comes from the spoken word of
[41:08] god
[41:10] the herb yielding seed the fruit tree
[41:12] yielding fruit after his kind whose seed
[41:14] is in itself
[41:15] upon the earth and it was sown and the
[41:17] earth brought forth grass and herb
[41:19] yielding seed after his kind and the
[41:20] tree yielded fruit
[41:22] whose seed was in itself after his kind
[41:26] so every seed is going to bring forth of
[41:27] its kind now that's already set in
[41:29] motion
[41:30] god put that in motion that is for the
[41:34] natural and the spiritual
[41:38] is that okay and god saw that it was
[41:42] good
[41:43] so he's going to keep it that way now
[41:45] let's go down to the 20th verse let's
[41:46] skip down god said let the waters bring
[41:48] forth abundantly the moving creatures
[41:50] that hath life the fowl
[41:52] that fly above the earth in the open
[41:55] firmament of heaven now remember
[41:57] we don't believe in darwin's theory of
[41:59] evolution
[42:01] we believe in creative evolution amen
[42:04] where god created the lord form and he
[42:06] keeps creating and creating and creating
[42:08] and you go all the way up to the monkey
[42:11] and then he didn't skip to the man i've
[42:13] been reading some articles on the
[42:15] missing link
[42:17] how many of you have heard about the
[42:18] missing link we all have
[42:21] even in our school probably more
[42:22] prevalent than than
[42:24] because they're trying to deny it now in
[42:27] the articles that i'm reading they're
[42:28] trying to deny that there was a missing
[42:30] link but the problem is is they come up
[42:32] to monkey and then there's a big jump to
[42:34] man and there's a gap in there that's
[42:36] why they call it the missing link
[42:38] right because in creative evolution what
[42:40] happens
[42:41] god created the small things then he
[42:44] comes up and
[42:45] remember the last next to the last day
[42:47] before he created man what he created
[42:49] beast of the field
[42:51] and all those different things everybody
[42:52] got that so we believe in creative
[42:55] evolution
[42:57] chickens all the way up
[43:00] monkey whatever you want to say
[43:02] chimpanzee
[43:04] and there had to be a creature in
[43:07] between
[43:09] man and the monkey
[43:13] because god can't break his creative
[43:15] evolution
[43:17] in creating every seed had to bring
[43:20] forth of its kind there had to be a
[43:22] specie here a specie here a specie here
[43:26] and now we got a species that our blood
[43:29] won't coincide with the monkey now right
[43:32] sure we may look like one and most of us
[43:34] act like one
[43:39] yes hey man louise says yeah
[43:44] just don't go pick and flee but you see
[43:48] that
[43:48] and man has said oh man look that's this
[43:50] ape and all these different things
[43:51] they're
[43:52] they're right up against us but they
[43:53] can't they can't procreate with man
[43:57] man can't procreate with animal why
[44:01] we'll find out in a minute god created
[44:04] great whales and every living creature
[44:05] that moveth which is the water brought
[44:06] forth abundantly after
[44:08] their kind and every wing fell after his
[44:10] kind and god saw that it was good
[44:12] and god blessed them and said look be
[44:14] fruitful
[44:15] and multiply he made male and female dog
[44:18] male and female cat male and female
[44:20] whale
[44:21] male and female chicken
[44:25] the egg didn't come first the chicken
[44:28] came first
[44:29] and they started having eggs
[44:32] be fruitful and multiply and fill the
[44:34] waters in the sea and let fowl multiply
[44:35] the earth
[44:36] and the evening in the morning were the
[44:37] fifth day and god said let the earth
[44:39] bring forth the living creatures after
[44:40] his kind
[44:42] cattle creeping things and beasts of the
[44:45] earth after his kind
[44:47] now remember
[44:50] there was an animal in the bible called
[44:52] the beast
[44:56] and god made the beast of the earth
[44:57] after his kind
[44:59] and cattle after their kind and
[45:01] everything that creepeth upon the earth
[45:03] after his kind
[45:05] and god saw that it was good and god
[45:08] said let us make man i'm fix
[45:10] i'm fixing to finish here this is my
[45:12] last creation
[45:13] right here i'm going to create this is
[45:15] the highest form
[45:17] that i'm going to create is right here
[45:20] and god said let us make man in our
[45:21] image after our likeness and let them
[45:23] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[45:24] and over the fowl of the air and over
[45:26] the cattle over all the earth
[45:27] and over every creeping thing that
[45:28] creepeth upon the earth so god created
[45:31] man our formed
[45:32] man in his own image and the image of
[45:34] god created in him male and female
[45:36] created he them and god blessed them and
[45:38] god said unto them be fruitful
[45:40] and multiply and replenish the earth and
[45:43] subdue it
[45:44] and have dominion over the fish of the
[45:46] sea now remember
[45:49] here's a key you see that word and
[45:51] subdue it
[45:52] now that means you had dominion and you
[45:54] had they were all
[45:55] subject to that man that was exactly the
[45:59] way it was before the fall
[46:02] adam had complete control and eve had
[46:04] complete control
[46:05] of all the earth of all nature of all
[46:07] the animals everybody got that say amen
[46:10] but now remember when the flood happened
[46:13] and noah and the boys come out of the
[46:14] ark
[46:15] god says the same thing but he leaves
[46:17] this off
[46:20] because after that he says you need
[46:23] you'll be eating meat
[46:26] in other words you won't have you won't
[46:27] subdue the earth anymore
[46:29] right now god tells them tells noah be
[46:33] fruitful and multiply and replenish the
[46:35] earth why they had to there was only
[46:37] eight of them in the whole earth
[46:38] that's right but he did not say to
[46:40] subdue it because they
[46:42] can't you can't subdue this kingdom
[46:44] until brother brown tells us
[46:45] until we get into the millennium that's
[46:47] when you and i will be in glorified
[46:49] bodies and we'll be able to move
[46:50] trees mountains animals remember the
[46:53] bible says the lion will lay down with
[46:55] the lamb
[46:57] the bear will be gentle
[47:00] right but now they're scared of us
[47:04] and if you make them really mad they'll
[47:05] eat you
[47:07] that's the chain of evolution
[47:10] there's an eating chain it's an eating
[47:12] order
[47:13] be fruitful multiply and replenish the
[47:15] earth and subdue it so he's telling this
[47:17] whatever this is which is a spirit man
[47:20] that they're going to subdue the earth
[47:22] and have dominion over the fish of the
[47:23] sea and follow the air and over every
[47:25] living thing that moveth
[47:27] upon the earth everybody good with that
[47:28] say amen stay with me here
[47:31] stay with me come on
[47:34] surely you didn't eat that much for
[47:35] lunch okay
[47:38] so now look
[47:43] so now we're going to go in just a
[47:44] minute and we're going to go to
[47:47] genesis 2 7. so remember this is genesis
[47:49] 1 26
[47:50] this is not genesis 2 7.
[47:54] not a different man but a different
[47:56] position has everybody got that
[47:59] all right now watch genesis 5 verse 1
[48:01] through 2 this is the book of the
[48:02] generations of adam
[48:03] and the day that god created man in the
[48:05] likeness of god may he him
[48:08] male and female created he them and
[48:10] blessed them
[48:11] and called their name adam
[48:16] anybody got that
[48:20] name was not eve
[48:23] because she was an extension of adam
[48:26] the bible says she was woman which woman
[48:29] is what
[48:29] womb man with a womb
[48:32] woman man with a womb but he called
[48:36] their name
[48:36] adam in the day that were they were
[48:38] created now there had to be something
[48:40] happen when adam then calls her
[48:44] eve because god's already called him
[48:46] adam everybody got that
[48:49] god's already called them their name is
[48:51] adam
[48:54] not eve adam
[48:57] names her eve after the fall happens
[49:00] all right
[49:03] now luke 3 verse 37 i want you to look
[49:06] it
[49:07] at this this is the lineage
[49:10] i want you also remember
[49:15] look at this lineage
[49:19] now remember every seed has to bring
[49:21] forth of its kind and if i'm the seed of
[49:23] samuel dale
[49:25] and josh is the seed of samuel wadedale
[49:27] the second
[49:29] and deanna's the seat you understand
[49:30] what i'm saying
[49:33] then we then when we write our lineage
[49:35] or our
[49:36] lineage tree all those names will be in
[49:39] there
[49:39] is that right listen i'm gonna holler i
[49:43] don't care y'all
[49:44] wake up or go sleep if you want to i
[49:45] don't care i'm telling you i'm gonna
[49:47] keep preaching until somebody stays
[49:48] awake
[49:51] you ain't the only one
[49:54] but now this is the lineage of adam
[49:58] there's a key here this is the lineage
[50:00] of adam right
[50:02] look who's not in that lineage
[50:07] find me kane in this lineage
[50:11] cain his name is not in this lineage
[50:13] this is in the bible this is luke 3
[50:15] verse 37
[50:16] it lists you every person from jesus
[50:19] christ all the way down to adam i
[50:21] believe it is
[50:22] or abraham all the way down jared
[50:25] malalio kanan enos
[50:29] seth
[50:33] which was the son of adam where's cain
[50:40] now the bible didn't leave it out it
[50:42] would have been
[50:43] in there if cain would have been the son
[50:45] of adam that's right
[50:47] amen because every seed has to bring
[50:49] forth of its kind
[50:51] but which was the son of adam
[50:54] which was the son of god adam was the
[50:58] son of god in the old testament amen
[51:00] adam was the first son of god but
[51:04] remember
[51:05] he sold us out nobody got that say amen
[51:09] all right because remember we're going
[51:10] to read the scripture here in just a few
[51:11] minutes that where
[51:12] eve was deceived abe adam was not
[51:15] deceived
[51:16] he knew exactly what he was doing all
[51:18] right so let's go to the cruelty of sin
[51:20] let's read this quote from brother
[51:21] branham and then we'll read a couple
[51:22] quotes
[51:24] because what now we're doing is is when
[51:26] god first made man
[51:28] he was a spirit man that genesis 1 26
[51:31] man
[51:32] was not a flesh man oh boy i'm going 10
[51:35] more minutes y'all sleep again
[51:39] you don't believe me i got about six
[51:40] more pages i could we'll just
[51:42] yeah you just just thank you but if that
[51:45] shield was like
[51:47] um sunglasses i wouldn't know if he's
[51:49] asleep or not
[51:50] so then when god made his first man he
[51:52] was the spirit man so that genesis 1 26
[51:54] man
[51:55] to control the world to control the
[51:57] earth that was a spirit man now you say
[51:59] oh was he fl no he was made in god's
[52:02] image and god is not like casper the
[52:04] friendly ghost
[52:07] because if we were made in his image
[52:08] according to genesis 1 26
[52:10] he must be a man and he ain't a woman
[52:16] sorry i don't want no woman god
[52:20] that's what got us in trouble to start
[52:21] with so then when god made his first man
[52:24] he was a spirit man
[52:26] he was something on the order of god or
[52:28] the son of god the logos
[52:30] that was the first man i want y'all to
[52:32] understand something you're not getting
[52:34] this i don't think
[52:37] we're not different from the creator
[52:41] that genesis 1 26 man did to create him
[52:46] exactly because he said it was the logos
[52:50] the word the speech what came out of god
[52:54] was that first man he said oh no that
[52:56] was you
[52:59] oh right then he gave the man
[53:03] jurisdiction to lead the animal life
[53:07] just like the holy spirit leads the
[53:08] believer today go here do this now if we
[53:10] were perfect in submission
[53:12] to the holy spirit you see what i'm
[53:14] talking about if we go back before the
[53:15] fall
[53:16] there's complete submission to the holy
[53:18] spirit brother brown said there was a
[53:20] holy spirit veil over adam and eve
[53:22] listen they walked through the garden
[53:23] naked for years
[53:25] never thought a thing about it never had
[53:27] a carnal per a carnal
[53:29] thought in their mind why because the
[53:30] holy spirit was on
[53:32] them to veil them
[53:36] and i believe that holy spirit veil is
[53:37] going to be put back on
[53:42] because he's put it inside of us to not
[53:44] lust like we used to
[53:47] don't tell me it was eating apples come
[53:48] on people our biggest problem is lust
[53:52] goodness gracious god would lead us by
[53:54] the holy spirit just like
[53:55] adam led the animals of that day does
[53:57] everybody got that say amen
[53:59] all right here we go number let's read
[54:01] this pill of fire i think i stuck this
[54:03] one in here
[54:04] i didn't put any red on but look what
[54:05] this i believe that jesus christ is the
[54:07] same yesterday today and forever
[54:09] and i believe that in the beginning god
[54:10] made man in his own image
[54:12] and god is a spirit and god made man
[54:15] spirit man
[54:16] then he made him in the dust of the
[54:18] earth that's what we're going to read
[54:19] because remember he took the genesis 1
[54:20] 26
[54:21] man and put it in the 2-7 man
[54:24] that's right amen not two creations
[54:30] he just put in morphine yes
[54:33] this logos this
[54:36] you say logos didn't didn't didn't
[54:39] didn't i say the logos was the word the
[54:41] word the sp
[54:42] the speech so where did that logos go
[54:45] it went into adam because immediately
[54:47] adam started naming all the animals
[54:50] and god didn't go no adam i didn't no he
[54:53] every time adam named an animal god said
[54:55] son that's exactly what i was thinking
[54:59] that's how much in tune god and adam
[55:01] were
[55:02] before the fall then he made him in the
[55:05] dust of the earth now i believe that man
[55:06] in the beginning well led the animals of
[55:08] the earth like the holy spirit ought to
[55:10] leave
[55:11] leave leading the church today there was
[55:14] no man to till the soil i want you to
[55:16] see this right here
[55:18] so then he put him in five senses what
[55:20] are our five senses see
[55:22] taste feel smell and hear and they
[55:25] every one can be deceiving and can be
[55:29] deceived
[55:30] see taste feel smelling here go to a
[55:32] magic show sometime
[55:35] amen you get deception everywhere in
[55:37] those five senses
[55:39] them five senses was not to contact god
[55:45] that was see taste filled smelling here
[55:47] they were to contact his earthly home
[55:50] but by his spirit
[55:53] he contacted god by his spirit he
[55:57] contacts god
[56:00] hmm how about that i like that but by
[56:03] he puts the two together the five senses
[56:05] does not contact god
[56:07] it's a way for me and you to contact
[56:08] each other it's a way for me and you to
[56:10] live on this earth by sea tastes feel
[56:12] smelling here
[56:13] but now satan knew that and satan moved
[56:16] right through that into that second
[56:18] realm of memory
[56:19] reasoning conscious affection and
[56:21] imagination and that's where his
[56:23] playground is still today
[56:25] all right now look let's start with this
[56:27] genesis 2
[56:29] 7. all right everybody okay we're in the
[56:31] bible now
[56:34] and the lord god formed a man of the
[56:35] dust of the ground and look
[56:37] breathed into his nostrils the breath of
[56:40] life
[56:41] and man became a living soul may i say
[56:43] man became adam
[56:45] there was only one guy adam
[56:50] but now remember he had the male part
[56:52] and the female part inside of him
[56:54] because of the genesis 1 26 man
[56:56] because where did god get that he took
[56:58] the rib
[57:00] he took the feminist spirit off of adam
[57:02] and put it on eve that's why
[57:04] watch how it's perverted today what
[57:05] satan done
[57:08] he took that feminist spirit and put it
[57:09] back on the men
[57:11] he's took that man spirit and put it on
[57:13] the woman
[57:15] he's a spiritual being he can manipulate
[57:17] see god said it right the first time
[57:19] yes satan is the one that's got it
[57:22] twisted
[57:23] for all these other perversions and
[57:24] everything because remember he can't
[57:25] bring life but he can pervert it
[57:28] all right so man became a living soul so
[57:31] there stood adam
[57:34] god formed of the dust of the ground so
[57:36] he took the ground while you and i are
[57:38] what sixteen elements of the earth
[57:40] potash calcium and all the different
[57:42] things all right
[57:44] and the lord god planted a garden
[57:46] eastward in eden
[57:48] and there he put the man who it formed
[57:51] and out of the ground made the lord god
[57:53] to grow every tree that is pleasant to
[57:55] the site
[57:56] and good for food there's that
[58:00] what's that thing over there called a
[58:03] semicolon
[58:05] because he didn't plant these two trees
[58:09] see that semicolon over there god is
[58:11] telling us now
[58:13] let's back up for a minute for those of
[58:15] you that are new
[58:17] who wrote the first five books of the
[58:18] bible moses
[58:20] moses was not in the garden he was old
[58:23] but he wasn't that old
[58:25] but he wasn't he had to go back by by
[58:28] vision
[58:28] or by revelation moses had to god had to
[58:31] project moses back into the garden of
[58:34] eden
[58:34] to write this right here
[58:37] remember the torah the first five books
[58:40] or even four books if you want to say
[58:41] the first four books were written by
[58:43] moses
[58:44] so he god had to project him into the
[58:46] garden of eden
[58:48] but he projected him in the garden of
[58:49] eden to write it in a mystery so that
[58:52] only
[58:53] the true genesis 1 26 people will
[58:55] understand really what happened
[58:58] because everything else is fairy tales
[59:02] santa claus easter trinity yeah all
[59:04] right they're fairy tales
[59:06] all right concocted not by god
[59:10] but by the devil he just perverted the
[59:12] word just like i'm telling you now
[59:13] there was a a man standing in the garden
[59:16] that had a feminist side to him and a
[59:18] masculine side and god separated the
[59:20] feminist side took a rib out made her a
[59:22] body
[59:23] and put that spirit in there and called
[59:26] her woman we'll look at it in a minute
[59:28] but out of the ground made the lord god
[59:29] to grow every tree that is pleasant in
[59:31] the sign good for food
[59:32] semicolon he's not he's bringing a
[59:34] thought but he's not stopping that one
[59:37] and he's not continuing that thought so
[59:39] much that
[59:40] he never said he planted these trees the
[59:43] tree of life you can't plant a tree of
[59:44] life
[59:45] oh yeah there's a natural tree of life
[59:47] everybody seen it
[59:49] it's like over in africa or somewhere
[59:51] and it keeps growing out and growing
[59:53] there's a june's got some pictures of it
[59:56] or you can buy it on a little pendant
[59:57] it's called the tree of life that's not
[59:59] that tree of life
[1:00:01] the tree of life also in the midst of
[1:00:03] the garden he put it right in the middle
[1:00:05] of the garden
[1:00:06] and the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:00:08] evil now what kind of tree would that
[1:00:10] look like
[1:00:11] what kind of fruit you're gonna get on
[1:00:12] that
[1:00:15] all right so we'll get somewhere in just
[1:00:17] a second everybody all right say amen
[1:00:21] still got one or two asleep so i'm
[1:00:22] continuing on and the lord god took the
[1:00:25] man
[1:00:26] and put him in the garden of eden to
[1:00:28] dress it in to keep it
[1:00:31] and the lord god commanded the man
[1:00:34] saying of every tree of the garden thou
[1:00:37] mayest freely eat now remember
[1:00:40] he's not in the written word but where's
[1:00:43] lucifer
[1:00:45] he's standing right there he ain't off
[1:00:48] on a party somewhere remember because he
[1:00:50] got whipped in heaven
[1:00:52] hallelujah he got whipped in heaven and
[1:00:56] he's on the earth didn't i just read you
[1:00:58] the scripture
[1:00:58] the fight was before the foundation of
[1:01:00] the world so satan satan can't go back
[1:01:02] to heaven
[1:01:04] so he's going he's going to be standing
[1:01:05] right there the lord god
[1:01:07] commanded the man luis you're adam
[1:01:11] i'm the man i'm commanding you of every
[1:01:14] tree of the garden that i may freely eat
[1:01:16] cause you know what you might get a
[1:01:17] little bit hungry every once in a while
[1:01:18] and you may want something to eat
[1:01:20] but of the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:01:22] evil
[1:01:24] thou shalt not eat of it and there he
[1:01:27] stood right there
[1:01:29] because the tree of knowledge of good
[1:01:30] and evil is not a tree it was lucifer
[1:01:34] because your two trees standing in the
[1:01:35] garden was the man that's talking to
[1:01:37] adam
[1:01:38] and lucifer that's your two trees in the
[1:01:40] garden listen that's not too little
[1:01:42] trees we know that
[1:01:45] there is no tree that you can get
[1:01:47] knowledge of good and evil off of
[1:01:50] you want me to prove that let me read
[1:01:52] you real quick brother louise pull i
[1:01:54] mean brother
[1:01:55] anderson pull that up that i told you we
[1:01:57] wouldn't need for a little while
[1:02:00] watch this mark 8 verse 24
[1:02:04] and he looked up and said i see men
[1:02:07] as trees walking moses is using an
[1:02:11] allegory or a simulation
[1:02:14] because it's not trees but he said i see
[1:02:17] men as trees what men
[1:02:18] right standing upright so what was the
[1:02:20] tree of life it was jesus christ
[1:02:23] what was the tree of knowledge of good
[1:02:24] and evil lucifer
[1:02:26] amen and which one you eat off of today
[1:02:30] you are eating off of one of those two
[1:02:32] trees right now
[1:02:32] spiritually speaking all right cut that
[1:02:35] out but we'll need that in just a minute
[1:02:38] but of the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:02:39] evil thou shalt i like that black
[1:02:41] background that's pretty neat
[1:02:42] thou shalt not eat of for in the day
[1:02:45] that thou
[1:02:45] eat us thereof
[1:02:49] thou shalt surely die remember that
[1:02:52] right
[1:02:53] right right and the lord god said it is
[1:02:56] not good that the man should be alone
[1:02:58] you know why because god said i was
[1:02:59] alone at one time
[1:03:01] i need adam to talk to but adam needs
[1:03:03] somebody to talk to him
[1:03:04] adam needs somebody to fulfill the
[1:03:06] genesis 126 of multiplication
[1:03:11] even though we spiritually multiply you
[1:03:13] still need a male and a female
[1:03:15] you still need jesus christ and his
[1:03:17] bride
[1:03:18] amen and the lord said it is not good
[1:03:21] that the man should be alone i will make
[1:03:22] him a help me now remember that not
[1:03:24] that's not helped mate i looked that
[1:03:27] word up again
[1:03:28] that word meat means equal
[1:03:33] i helped mate like brother dale said i
[1:03:35] helped mate you you can
[1:03:36] two men can make but it's not right
[1:03:39] but but you can't be a help meat
[1:03:43] that's what that word meat means m-e-e-t
[1:03:47] it is a helper co-equal with the person
[1:03:50] that was created because remember before
[1:03:54] the fall adam and eve were one
[1:03:56] they were right here just like this
[1:03:58] right there was none of this you had the
[1:04:00] ruler over this one and you had to the
[1:04:01] ruler over that one
[1:04:03] no eve was what eve was adam made
[1:04:06] manifest in another form
[1:04:08] she was a man with a womb out of the
[1:04:11] ground
[1:04:12] the lord god formed every beast of the
[1:04:14] field and every fowl of the air
[1:04:17] and brought them unto adam to see what
[1:04:19] he would call them
[1:04:20] and whatsoever adam called every living
[1:04:23] creature
[1:04:24] that was the name there of in other
[1:04:26] words god said it's good
[1:04:29] because you know what god knew that that
[1:04:31] big gray thing that had a trunk sticking
[1:04:33] out weighed
[1:04:33] 10 or 15 tons he knew that was an
[1:04:36] elephant
[1:04:38] and adam said oh we'll name that
[1:04:40] elephant
[1:04:42] amen and god gave names
[1:04:45] adam gave names to all cattle
[1:04:48] wait a minute am i done there oh i'm
[1:04:51] sorry
[1:04:52] to see what they called him and that was
[1:04:53] the name thereof and adam gave
[1:04:55] names to all the cattle fell in the air
[1:04:58] every beast said why does that keep
[1:04:59] coming up beast
[1:05:01] beast of the field but for adam there
[1:05:04] was not found and helped me
[1:05:06] for him and the lord god caused a deep
[1:05:08] sleep to fall upon adam here's your
[1:05:10] first surgery in the bible
[1:05:12] and he slept and he took one of the ribs
[1:05:14] and closed up the flesh
[1:05:16] instead thereof and the rib which the
[1:05:19] lord god taken from the man
[1:05:21] made he a woman and brought her unto
[1:05:24] adam
[1:05:25] and adam said
[1:05:28] adam said this is now bone of my fa
[1:05:32] by listen literally she
[1:05:35] literally had the same dna he had but
[1:05:38] she was just in the woman form
[1:05:40] and him being in the man form all right
[1:05:42] everybody got that
[1:05:44] this is now bone of my bone flesh of my
[1:05:47] flesh
[1:05:48] she shall be called woman what man with
[1:05:50] a womb woe man
[1:05:51] woman because she was taken out of
[1:05:55] man therefore shall a man leave his
[1:05:57] father mother and shall cleave unto his
[1:05:59] wife and they shall be one flesh
[1:06:01] and they were both naked the man and his
[1:06:03] wife
[1:06:04] and we're not ashamed wow what a strange
[1:06:07] thing
[1:06:08] right can't happen now
[1:06:14] but remember what we're fixing to talk
[1:06:16] about remember
[1:06:18] you can take a two-year-old child
[1:06:22] boy and a girl put them in a bathtub
[1:06:25] they'll play with the toys they can be
[1:06:26] naked as the day that is born they'll
[1:06:28] play with toys
[1:06:29] they ain't worrying about that other
[1:06:30] stuff
[1:06:32] now wait till they're 15 don't put them
[1:06:35] two back in the same bathtub again
[1:06:38] now where did that come from that come
[1:06:39] from right here
[1:06:41] that come from the mind that come from
[1:06:43] the mind
[1:06:44] the carnal mind is enmity to gods
[1:06:47] everybody got that say amen
[1:06:48] because we're going to get into
[1:06:49] something right here in genesis 3 verse
[1:06:51] 1.
[1:06:52] now look
[1:06:55] here's the great mystery it's not a
[1:06:57] mystery to most of us
[1:06:59] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[1:07:01] beast now
[1:07:02] literally a serpent is not a beast
[1:07:07] but he named it that here's now look
[1:07:09] here's moses
[1:07:11] here i go again you got to go back into
[1:07:13] the mind of god and let
[1:07:15] let god show you what moses was doing
[1:07:17] moses was sitting somewhere
[1:07:19] writing this down and he was watching a
[1:07:22] vision
[1:07:22] right yeah amen first television
[1:07:27] vision he was watching this vision right
[1:07:31] now the serpent was more subtle subtle
[1:07:35] than any beast of the field which the
[1:07:36] lord god had made so there is a beast
[1:07:39] now
[1:07:40] come into the picture everybody got that
[1:07:45] and he said unto the woman listen monkey
[1:07:48] can't talk
[1:07:48] that's right right chimpanzee can't talk
[1:07:53] orangutan can't talk spider-monkey can't
[1:07:56] talk
[1:07:57] this thing started talking amen
[1:08:01] and he said unto the woman yeah god said
[1:08:04] you shall not eat of every tree of the
[1:08:06] garden
[1:08:09] now we don't know about time and we
[1:08:12] don't know what
[1:08:13] went on but that beast had to be around
[1:08:16] adam and eve for a long time
[1:08:20] because he could communicate with him he
[1:08:22] was the communication between
[1:08:25] adam the beast and the other animals
[1:08:27] everybody got that
[1:08:29] it's just simple because he's talking
[1:08:31] now
[1:08:34] but what did satan do satan stood right
[1:08:36] there and he watched that
[1:08:39] and he couldn't create an animal
[1:08:42] but he sure can anoint an animal
[1:08:46] so he anointed this beast now who is
[1:08:48] this talking this is not the beast
[1:08:50] talking you say well
[1:08:53] how do you know that well you know what
[1:08:55] why does the bible start with a beast in
[1:08:57] the beginning with us so much trouble
[1:08:59] and why does he end up in the book of
[1:09:00] revelations
[1:09:01] with a beast that has power
[1:09:04] that is talking amen
[1:09:08] they're all right well why'd he start
[1:09:10] with a beast and
[1:09:11] and then now he's called the beast in
[1:09:13] the very end that's going to what
[1:09:15] deceive the whole world
[1:09:18] he didn't have to deceive but one woman
[1:09:20] in the beginning
[1:09:21] but he deceived the whole world over
[1:09:23] here in the end
[1:09:25] amen you see how that beast is yes
[1:09:29] because remember whoever this whatever
[1:09:31] this animal is it was turned into a
[1:09:33] snake
[1:09:35] it didn't start a snake it was turned
[1:09:36] into a snake
[1:09:38] amen you shall not eat of every tree of
[1:09:40] this garden
[1:09:42] and the woman said unto the serpent
[1:09:43] first thing she should have said was let
[1:09:44] me go get my husband
[1:09:49] she got out from under headship that was
[1:09:51] her first problem right there cause
[1:09:52] remember satan is not one
[1:09:54] he's not playing with her body
[1:09:57] there's a veil there but he's playing in
[1:10:01] her mind
[1:10:06] that's where the first seed got planted
[1:10:08] right here
[1:10:11] and the woman said unto the serpent we
[1:10:14] may eat of the fruit
[1:10:15] fruit of the trees of the garden but
[1:10:18] of the fruit of the tree which is in the
[1:10:20] midst of the garden now remember
[1:10:23] she didn't say anything about tree of
[1:10:25] life
[1:10:27] she's talking about tree of knowledge of
[1:10:28] good and evil
[1:10:31] of the tree of the which is in the midst
[1:10:34] of the garden
[1:10:35] god has said ye shall not
[1:10:38] eat of it neither shall you touch it
[1:10:40] touch it why would you not want to touch
[1:10:41] a tree
[1:10:43] if this is a literal tree
[1:10:47] that's right why'd god say don't touch
[1:10:49] that bark
[1:10:52] yeah it's kind of silly in it that
[1:10:54] people think it was a little tree
[1:10:56] and the serpent said of the woman ye
[1:10:58] shall
[1:10:59] surely die nope he didn't say that
[1:11:03] he said ye shall not
[1:11:07] surely die that's right there's the fall
[1:11:10] right there because that planted a seed
[1:11:12] in eve's mind
[1:11:14] that she can get by or she's going to
[1:11:16] fulfill god's promise
[1:11:18] through this beast
[1:11:22] not that one word right there
[1:11:26] god said you eat there you shall surely
[1:11:29] die
[1:11:31] just in genesis 2 verse 17. and here we
[1:11:33] go in genesis 3
[1:11:35] verse 4 he's already adding to the word
[1:11:40] lucifer through the beast is talking you
[1:11:43] shall not surely die
[1:11:45] for god doth know that in the day god
[1:11:48] sees god
[1:11:50] god doth know that in the day ye eat
[1:11:53] thereof then your eyes will be open
[1:11:56] and you shall be as god she should have
[1:11:57] stopped him right there and said hey
[1:11:59] i am a god she was already a god
[1:12:04] she had dominion over the fish of the
[1:12:06] sea and foul the air and all the
[1:12:08] different things she
[1:12:08] you see how he blinded her eye right
[1:12:12] knowing good and evil they knew good but
[1:12:13] they didn't know evil
[1:12:15] and when the woman saw
[1:12:19] not touched at that moment saw
[1:12:22] that the tree was good for food and wait
[1:12:25] a minute it was pleasant to the eyes now
[1:12:28] i like this little cornucopia thing they
[1:12:29] do in
[1:12:30] october and i like that beautiful fruit
[1:12:32] but i ain't never seen a fruit that was
[1:12:34] present pleasant
[1:12:38] she says it was pleasant to the eye
[1:12:44] roll it up so everybody can see it and a
[1:12:47] tree to be desired
[1:12:50] to make one wise what kind of tree is
[1:12:53] this
[1:13:00] she took of the fruit thereof and did
[1:13:03] eat
[1:13:05] and gave also and to her husband with
[1:13:07] her
[1:13:08] and he did eat and the eyes of them both
[1:13:11] were
[1:13:11] open and they knew that they were naked
[1:13:15] now why did a piece of fruit until adam
[1:13:18] and eve they were naked
[1:13:20] no and they sewed fig leaves together
[1:13:23] and made themselves aprons
[1:13:25] and they put them where they needed to
[1:13:26] be not in their hands and their mouth
[1:13:31] now let me tell you how this works
[1:13:34] how this is all put together god puts
[1:13:37] little keys in the bible now brother
[1:13:39] anderson pull that back up now look she
[1:13:41] thought hold on
[1:13:42] hold on go back how about what now took
[1:13:44] of the fruit we're talking about fruit
[1:13:45] right we're talking about fruit fruit
[1:13:47] fruit fruit fruit fruit we're talking
[1:13:48] about fruit right
[1:13:49] and everybody's got apples and oranges
[1:13:50] in their mind now watch this let's go to
[1:13:52] genesis 30 verse 2.
[1:13:55] the one that you pulled up that you
[1:13:57] miraculous thank you
[1:13:59] and jacob's anger was kindled against
[1:14:01] rachel and he said am i in god's stead
[1:14:03] who has be
[1:14:04] withheld from thee the fruit
[1:14:09] of the womb
[1:14:14] psalms 127 verse 3 low children are a
[1:14:17] heritage
[1:14:18] of the lord and the fruit of the womb
[1:14:22] is his reward
[1:14:26] what are you you are the fruit
[1:14:30] that was born in your mother
[1:14:33] womb in your mother's womb so don't tell
[1:14:36] me this is talking about a tree
[1:14:38] that's regular fruit no god gives us all
[1:14:42] these pointers there are several places
[1:14:44] in the bible talks about the fruit of
[1:14:45] the womb
[1:14:46] because you are that what is that that's
[1:14:48] a that's a sexual thing
[1:14:49] that's that's how you procreate you are
[1:14:52] the fruit of the womb but listen you and
[1:14:54] i were not supposed to come the way that
[1:14:55] she's fixing to do
[1:14:58] you and i were supposed to come what up
[1:15:00] here
[1:15:01] spoken word seed children because this
[1:15:05] is the biggest womb
[1:15:08] [Music]
[1:15:09] right here this is your problem right
[1:15:13] here
[1:15:16] because it emanates from here to where
[1:15:20] she's fixing to do the act with the
[1:15:22] beast
[1:15:24] let's go back now let's go back to the
[1:15:27] to genesis
[1:15:28] so there's talk about this then it's not
[1:15:29] always talking about fruit fruit fruit
[1:15:31] fruit so now go up to genesis
[1:15:35] first timothy 2 verse 12. if this is now
[1:15:38] remember
[1:15:40] adam and eve were equal everything was
[1:15:42] fine everything was dandy she and him
[1:15:43] were
[1:15:44] co-equal but now after the fall
[1:15:48] but i suffered not a woman to teach nor
[1:15:49] herself authority over a man but to be
[1:15:51] in silence that's why we don't believe
[1:15:52] in women preachers we don't
[1:15:54] it's not that we don't believe in women
[1:15:55] preachers the bible tells us
[1:15:57] we shouldn't have women preacher for
[1:15:58] adam was first formed then eve
[1:16:01] and adam was not deceived but the woman
[1:16:04] being deceived
[1:16:05] was in the transgression because
[1:16:07] remember in genesis 3 now let's go back
[1:16:09] to genesis 3
[1:16:10] 15 where genesis 3 7
[1:16:13] to where we were at just just scroll it
[1:16:15] down there you go
[1:16:18] hold on go back up that way whoa and
[1:16:20] when the woman saw that the tree was
[1:16:21] good for food it was pleasant to the
[1:16:23] eyes
[1:16:23] now what's satan doing satan through the
[1:16:25] beast is telling her say look god told
[1:16:27] you to procreate
[1:16:29] god told you to multiply look at the
[1:16:31] animals look at the birds look at the
[1:16:33] other things that's going on
[1:16:39] he said what's your problem
[1:16:43] see he's going natural with it what's
[1:16:45] your problem
[1:16:46] what's your problem what you're a little
[1:16:48] slow there eve
[1:16:50] but i can help you out because see i can
[1:16:53] being the beast
[1:16:54] i can coincide with you i can in other
[1:16:56] words i can have
[1:16:57] relations with you and we can have this
[1:16:59] multiply and replenish the earth thing
[1:17:01] that god's telling us about
[1:17:03] see how slick he is it wasn't he was so
[1:17:06] far off the word he was just
[1:17:07] he was just
[1:17:11] horrible which it was the most horrible
[1:17:12] thing that ever happened but eve
[1:17:14] received it in the womb of her mind
[1:17:16] first then the natural act happened
[1:17:19] because remember
[1:17:21] cain is not in the lineage of adam
[1:17:25] why is cain not in the lineage of adam
[1:17:27] and she came through and he came through
[1:17:29] eve
[1:17:32] he's never in the lineage right then you
[1:17:35] go way over in the bible it tells you
[1:17:37] that enoch was the seventh from adam
[1:17:38] will you count from enoch seven
[1:17:40] seven generations cain's not in there
[1:17:45] it never mentions cain cain is of that
[1:17:47] wicked one cain come from what
[1:17:50] the beast there is your mystery
[1:17:55] because god then actually what did god
[1:17:57] do
[1:17:59] god said okay
[1:18:03] man's not gonna be able to find you
[1:18:04] anymore this horrible thing that you've
[1:18:07] done and we'll stop right here we'll get
[1:18:08] to that
[1:18:09] later on because in genesis 3 what
[1:18:12] happens then
[1:18:13] god comes down and says
[1:18:17] adam where are you
[1:18:20] because before then adam and eve could
[1:18:22] walk right up to the creator and talk to
[1:18:24] him just like me and brother callie with
[1:18:25] no
[1:18:26] shame no fear
[1:18:30] because there was no fear when you when
[1:18:32] you have only good there's no fear the
[1:18:34] fear is when you have evil
[1:18:36] right because that's what we fear now we
[1:18:38] fear the evil
[1:18:39] we don't fear the good that god does to
[1:18:41] us we feel the evil that the devil's
[1:18:42] trying to do to us
[1:18:44] but then god comes to the garden of eden
[1:18:45] and he's not adam's not running after
[1:18:48] i'm not guess what we did
[1:18:52] no he was ashamed of what he did
[1:18:55] it was so shameful he didn't want to
[1:18:57] meet god so they go running back in the
[1:18:58] garden of eden and behind the trees
[1:19:01] and god has to go looking for adam just
[1:19:03] like he went looking for me and you
[1:19:08] just like you went looking for me and
[1:19:10] you you weren't looking for god
[1:19:12] because you were a sorry bunch of flesh
[1:19:16] all of us were but god came looking for
[1:19:19] me
[1:19:20] boys i like that song he came looking
[1:19:23] for me
[1:19:25] when i was down and low he came looking
[1:19:26] for me so listen
[1:19:29] hold on a minute god didn't walk into
[1:19:32] the garden
[1:19:33] brother doherty and say i really don't
[1:19:35] know what went on
[1:19:37] i'm trying to find adam he knew exactly
[1:19:39] what was going to happen
[1:19:40] he knew exactly what had happened he was
[1:19:42] looking for his son
[1:19:44] he was looking for his daughter he was
[1:19:47] looking to save them they were trying to
[1:19:50] save their self by
[1:19:52] sowing that fig leaf apron up
[1:19:55] to what to cover their self
[1:19:59] but god comes walking up and we'll get
[1:20:01] to it next week
[1:20:03] in other words god's standing there he
[1:20:04] said i know i knew what you'd do
[1:20:09] so before the foundation of the world
[1:20:12] in my mind i went to calvary
[1:20:17] and now what said in the book of
[1:20:18] revelation says revelation somewhere in
[1:20:20] there it says that
[1:20:21] that all will be deceived if they don't
[1:20:22] have their name written in the lamb's
[1:20:24] book of life slain
[1:20:25] before the foundation of the world and
[1:20:28] actually
[1:20:29] literally god almighty himself
[1:20:32] made a sacrifice amen he killed two
[1:20:35] lambs
[1:20:36] bible tells us we'll read it next sunday
[1:20:38] he takes two lambs rips the skin off of
[1:20:41] them
[1:20:41] throws them into the bushes and says put
[1:20:43] that on
[1:20:45] because you're going to need a blood
[1:20:46] covering
[1:20:48] you're not going to need you know what
[1:20:50] the word religion means
[1:20:52] the word religion literally means
[1:20:53] covering they were making their own
[1:20:56] religion
[1:20:57] they were trying to cover up what they
[1:20:59] had done but god knew what they'd do
[1:21:01] he took killed those two lambs throw
[1:21:03] them back in the bushes
[1:21:04] here put this on and then we see several
[1:21:07] months later on we see two twins born
[1:21:11] it's all yeah cain
[1:21:14] and abel were born from the beast
[1:21:17] and adam
[1:21:21] and that started a line now remember
[1:21:24] that was a natural line
[1:21:26] because remember cain could have stopped
[1:21:30] the spiritual part
[1:21:32] when god told him said if you'll do as
[1:21:35] your brother abel
[1:21:37] in other words i'll forgive you and if
[1:21:38] you'll go do a lamb sacrifice
[1:21:41] but he said no why because he was like
[1:21:44] he had what the characteristics of that
[1:21:46] seed that brought forth of his kind
[1:21:47] which was an animal
[1:21:49] which was a beast that's why cain
[1:21:52] is of that wicked one he slew abel
[1:21:56] in type that christ would come through
[1:21:59] seth
[1:22:00] being resurrected back up right because
[1:22:03] i'm gonna read i'll read it to you next
[1:22:04] sunday there's like two times in the
[1:22:06] bible that shows the
[1:22:08] genealogy of adam and cain is nowhere
[1:22:12] exactly to be found because it wasn't
[1:22:16] remember
[1:22:16] remember eve the bible says is the
[1:22:19] mother of all living
[1:22:20] that's the truth amen but adam was not
[1:22:24] the father of all living
[1:22:26] there was a beast got interjected
[1:22:29] interjected in there
[1:22:30] and god so took that thing and made it a
[1:22:33] snake
[1:22:35] afterwards to where you can't find the
[1:22:37] skeleton the beast anymore you can't
[1:22:39] find anything oh sure you can find them
[1:22:41] that look like cane
[1:22:42] because even the bible tells you that
[1:22:44] there were giants in the land
[1:22:46] big people big creatures listen cain
[1:22:48] didn't look a bit like abel
[1:22:52] because they had different daddies
[1:22:54] that's why cain slew abel
[1:22:56] cain didn't have a daddy to lead and
[1:22:57] guide him and he wouldn't take
[1:23:00] correction just like lucifer
[1:23:02] did in the beginning let's stand our
[1:23:04] feet the two spirits
[1:23:07] are now come from a spiritual lineage
[1:23:10] which is lucifer and his angels and god
[1:23:13] and his angels and god is walking
[1:23:15] literally in the garden of eden
[1:23:17] there's his son and daughter they have
[1:23:20] fallen they have done something they
[1:23:21] were told not to do
[1:23:23] but remember god was so gracious
[1:23:29] listen to me god was so gracious he
[1:23:32] didn't destroy adam
[1:23:34] and he didn't destroy eve
[1:23:37] he didn't even curse adam the only thing
[1:23:40] he'd done to eve is sisters you know
[1:23:42] what i'm talking about
[1:23:43] you're going to have sorrow and
[1:23:45] childbearing you're going to have your
[1:23:48] 30-day cycle you're going to be weak
[1:23:50] you're going to be the weaker vessel
[1:23:51] man is going to be over you man is going
[1:23:54] to be your head ship from now on
[1:23:56] because you are the one that got
[1:23:58] deceived
[1:24:00] by an animal
[1:24:05] but now remember the first adam
[1:24:09] musicians come on the first adam
[1:24:14] knew what he was doing he could not kill
[1:24:18] eve and start over because she was
[1:24:19] literally him
[1:24:23] the second adam came on earth
[1:24:28] he wasn't deceived either but he was
[1:24:31] getting ready to do as brother dale's
[1:24:32] talking about he's getting ready to
[1:24:33] build his body back
[1:24:35] he's getting ready to put it back in an
[1:24:37] eating condition he's getting ready now
[1:24:40] right now he's building that body back
[1:24:43] in an even condition where had there not
[1:24:44] been a fall adam and eve would have been
[1:24:46] there now
[1:24:47] whatever you want to say doesn't matter
[1:24:49] to me but it had
[1:24:50] it was never sex to be multiplication
[1:24:55] that genesis 1 26 man was supposed to
[1:24:57] multiply just like right now
[1:24:59] when the word goes forth that's a seed
[1:25:01] that's a spoken word
[1:25:02] and you all every one of you that's born
[1:25:05] again today came from a spoken
[1:25:07] word seed doesn't matter
[1:25:10] doesn't matter what your background of
[1:25:12] your natural seed was that came because
[1:25:15] of the fall
[1:25:16] doesn't matter if your mama was a
[1:25:18] and your daddy was a drunk
[1:25:20] that's right god don't look at that if
[1:25:22] you'll turn to him
[1:25:25] you'll turn to him you know what he's
[1:25:26] saying he says look
[1:25:28] i can't help you in that condition
[1:25:32] because every seed's got to bring forth
[1:25:34] of its kind see satan knew that that's
[1:25:36] why he could get over there in the beast
[1:25:38] and say okay god
[1:25:39] you now gonna have to fulfill your word
[1:25:43] because i'm fixing to enter this beast
[1:25:46] and i'm going to make this beast
[1:25:49] have a relations with your daughter
[1:25:53] eve and i'm going to defile the whole
[1:25:56] thing
[1:25:58] and god couldn't stop it because he put
[1:26:02] eve on free moral agency
[1:26:05] and he said every seed had to bring
[1:26:06] forth of its kind so the seed that she
[1:26:08] was
[1:26:08] that she was given was a beast seed
[1:26:12] that's why that we see genesis 3 15.
[1:26:17] you don't believe that genesis 3 15
[1:26:19] tells us we'll read it next sunday he
[1:26:22] said i'll put enmity or division between
[1:26:24] thy seed
[1:26:26] and the seed of the woman now who was
[1:26:28] the seed of the woman see the woman's
[1:26:29] not a woman
[1:26:30] see the woman's christ because a woman
[1:26:32] don't have a seed she had to
[1:26:33] the seed had to be planted in the womb
[1:26:35] of mary but remember
[1:26:37] mary's womb was not
[1:26:40] the first place that god came to
[1:26:45] remember he sent gabriel to
[1:26:48] talk to mary
[1:26:53] and mary had to accept it here first
[1:26:57] this is the first womb right here
[1:27:00] she accepted in this woman and all of a
[1:27:02] sudden what was fulfilled isaiah 9
[1:27:05] 6 says the virgin shall conceive see
[1:27:09] satan satan's going ah god you got to do
[1:27:11] everything you said you got to do
[1:27:12] everything you said and god's over going
[1:27:13] yeah i know
[1:27:16] i know i got all that set up devil i i
[1:27:19] don't know where you think i came from
[1:27:21] but i wasn't even born i've been here
[1:27:23] way before you was
[1:27:25] and i've got this all fixed when i said
[1:27:26] every seed to bring forth of its kind
[1:27:28] guess what
[1:27:31] god germ god egg put in a woman
[1:27:35] beginning of the creation of god
[1:27:38] genesis i mean revelations 3 14 what
[1:27:40] brother dale's been preaching on where
[1:27:41] the bible says the beginning
[1:27:43] of the creation of god and you and i
[1:27:46] being the continuation of that because
[1:27:48] jesus christ the son of man said he come
[1:27:51] forth to do what
[1:27:53] soul seed
[1:27:56] and what is seed the word he sowed the
[1:28:00] word down into paul
[1:28:02] i mean peter james john all the
[1:28:04] different ones it was on the day of
[1:28:05] pentecost
[1:28:06] and god didn't have to come down through
[1:28:08] an act like happened in the garden no he
[1:28:11] came down from
[1:28:12] a spiritual act got to the womb of their
[1:28:15] mind and said if you'll let me in that
[1:28:17] womb
[1:28:18] i'll give you something that man cannot
[1:28:21] give you
[1:28:22] i'll give you eternal life i don't care
[1:28:24] what your mama was i don't care what
[1:28:25] your daddy was
[1:28:26] i don't care if you don't even know who
[1:28:27] your mom and daddy is
[1:28:31] when you get born again you'll know who
[1:28:32] your mama and daddy is
[1:28:35] your mama's a word of god and the
[1:28:37] heavenly father is your daddy
[1:28:40] and what does he do he comes down and
[1:28:41] fertilizes that womb in your mind
[1:28:45] and gives you spiritual revelation
[1:28:49] but trust me the world is deceived about
[1:28:52] what went on in the garden
[1:28:54] there's no way that it was an apple or
[1:28:57] anything like that
[1:28:59] listen it's like daddy said many times
[1:29:01] before just sit down somewhere in a dark
[1:29:04] room and close your eyes
[1:29:05] and realize what your problem is right
[1:29:08] you'll know it wasn't you ate an apple
[1:29:10] amen
[1:29:12] the carnal mind the bible says is an
[1:29:14] enmity
[1:29:16] with god that's our division is right
[1:29:18] here that's why jesus didn't have a
[1:29:20] carnal mind he didn't have an
[1:29:21] earthly mother or father oh now mary was
[1:29:25] mary wasn't his mother she didn't
[1:29:28] produce anything
[1:29:30] zero she didn't produce an egg if she
[1:29:32] had produced an egg it would have been a
[1:29:33] body
[1:29:34] that would have had a natural lineage
[1:29:37] amen no no no spiritual lineage
[1:29:41] so god created the egg god created the
[1:29:43] germ put them together in the womb of
[1:29:45] mary
[1:29:46] and she just says be it unto me
[1:29:50] according to thy word can we say that
[1:29:51] today let's sing a song
[1:29:53] god bless you touching jesus
[1:30:11] [Music]
[1:30:15] yeah we got a lot of natural trouble
[1:30:18] try jesus
[1:30:20] [Music]
[1:30:26] [Music]
[1:30:32] of god oh
[1:30:36] touching jesus is
[1:30:39] all that really matters
[1:30:45] and your life would never be
[1:30:51] the same
[1:30:54] [Music]
[1:30:56] and there's only
[1:30:59] one way
[1:31:06] [Music]
[1:31:12] one more time let's worship it for a
[1:31:14] minute
[1:31:16] jesus is all
[1:31:20] that really matters
[1:31:23] [Music]
[1:31:25] and your life will never be
[1:31:30] [Music]
[1:31:35] [Applause]
[1:31:38] one way
[1:31:48] [Music]
[1:31:52] you know i was thinking the other day
[1:31:53] the world calls the name of jesus a lot
[1:31:57] but they blaspheme most of the time
[1:32:00] why in the world would you want to call
[1:32:02] that precious name
[1:32:05] and and use it as a slang word but the
[1:32:09] world does it all the time
[1:32:10] why would you take the most perfect name
[1:32:14] the salvation of the world comes through
[1:32:16] that name there's no other name
[1:32:18] whereby men can be saved yes they turn
[1:32:20] why because satan has perverted it
[1:32:23] he's twisted it just a little bit that's
[1:32:25] the same way i'm telling you now
[1:32:27] we talked about the two spirits when
[1:32:29] when when eve
[1:32:31] and the beast were right there so close
[1:32:32] together
[1:32:34] those two spirits were right there
[1:32:38] and they were talking to each other
[1:32:42] and you see what happened because in
[1:32:45] eve what eve had the emotion
[1:32:49] eve you know sisters you all are more
[1:32:51] emotional than men
[1:32:53] um and satan knew that he had a way to
[1:32:55] get to you
[1:32:57] and that was through eve's emotion
[1:33:00] that's why that now that that we look at
[1:33:03] emotions good but you know what
[1:33:06] lucifer was full of emotion he was the
[1:33:09] anointed cherub he was an anointed angel
[1:33:11] he was the song leader he was the one
[1:33:13] that got everything going and
[1:33:15] and probably led the choir in heaven
[1:33:17] until he figured out he didn't want to
[1:33:18] do that anymore
[1:33:19] he wanted something a lot better so he
[1:33:23] comes down here
[1:33:25] and he sees a pure adam and eve standing
[1:33:27] in the garden
[1:33:29] and what a deceiver what a what a awful
[1:33:32] thing because that was so beautiful
[1:33:38] think about it joy peace
[1:33:42] nothing going wrong no sickness no
[1:33:43] heartaches no trouble
[1:33:46] you'd think but see we're dealing with
[1:33:49] the devil
[1:33:50] [Music]
[1:33:52] he says i'm gonna go down there in that
[1:33:54] perfect garden
[1:33:57] everything's all in order
[1:34:01] adam can just speak and the wind stops
[1:34:05] eve can just speak and the animals move
[1:34:07] out of the way
[1:34:09] but i'm gonna go down there because i
[1:34:11] found a weak vessel
[1:34:13] and i'm going to mar
[1:34:16] that image you know what satan was
[1:34:19] saying
[1:34:20] i'm gonna create me an eden
[1:34:25] and this is what he gets right here this
[1:34:27] is satan's eden that we're living in
[1:34:29] right now
[1:34:31] but the most deceiving part is though is
[1:34:34] that one word
[1:34:36] not quoted everything he could quote
[1:34:39] except
[1:34:40] not so we must take this word of god
[1:34:43] brother brown said he said
[1:34:45] one word got him out he said one word
[1:34:47] wrong got him out one word wrong won't
[1:34:49] get us back in
[1:34:51] so that's why we strive and we try to
[1:34:54] live so close to the bible
[1:34:55] and so close to what the holy spirit
[1:34:57] tells us to do
[1:34:59] even more than the world that's why
[1:35:00] sometimes the world thinks they know
[1:35:01] we're strange they just meet us a little
[1:35:03] while and they know that we
[1:35:04] were different i hope so
[1:35:08] i hope they do know that we're different
[1:35:10] that they can see our different walk and
[1:35:12] different actions why because
[1:35:14] we come from a spoken word seed of god
[1:35:18] that cannot fall will not fall
[1:35:21] and never fail genesis 1 26 man never
[1:35:25] fell
[1:35:27] they fell in their spirit realm and
[1:35:28] their their body just reacted to what
[1:35:30] was going on
[1:35:31] everybody got that adam and eve had
[1:35:34] eternal life
[1:35:35] in their soul just like you have eternal
[1:35:38] life in your soul
[1:35:40] but god said that's all right devil he
[1:35:42] said because i got a desire
[1:35:46] i want to save them people you want to
[1:35:48] kill them
[1:35:49] and you want to put them in your eden he
[1:35:51] said but i want to save them
[1:35:52] and take them right back into the garden
[1:35:54] of eden that's what he said in christ
[1:35:56] the mystery of god reveal what
[1:35:57] take us back to the garden of eden
[1:36:01] as if there had not been a fall god had
[1:36:03] to allow your body to come here
[1:36:05] through whatever desire from your
[1:36:07] parents
[1:36:09] but you had to match that image that god
[1:36:12] saw before the foundation of the world
[1:36:14] and when you match that image we're
[1:36:17] going to take it right out of here
[1:36:19] because when our body gets changed folks
[1:36:20] we're not going to change back into a
[1:36:22] different one
[1:36:23] this body at 20 years old is just going
[1:36:25] to move right back into that
[1:36:28] because that's the part that god saw
[1:36:29] [Music]
[1:36:31] before all this chaos happened
[1:36:34] i love that folks he preserved that part
[1:36:37] of him that
[1:36:38] satan listen satan can be religious
[1:36:42] satan can have an anointing satan can
[1:36:43] quote the word word for word all but one
[1:36:45] word
[1:36:46] but he can't ever be that one part
[1:36:49] he can't ever be that part of that
[1:36:52] genesis 1 26
[1:36:54] cannot can't touch it
[1:36:57] and if you got it in your soul today he
[1:36:58] can't touch you
[1:37:01] so you pray for revelation because we
[1:37:03] need revelation more than anything in
[1:37:05] this world
[1:37:06] is what the bible said it's what we're
[1:37:09] trying to do
[1:37:11] and we're going to try to live this as
[1:37:13] close as we can
[1:37:15] thank god that we know where we came
[1:37:18] from
[1:37:20] we know what we're doing here and we
[1:37:23] know where we're going
[1:37:25] to me that's an assurity that's not a
[1:37:27] hope
[1:37:29] i don't hope i'm safe i don't hope
[1:37:31] there's a heaven for us to go to
[1:37:33] i don't hope there's this i know for a
[1:37:36] fact
[1:37:38] a fact that we're going somewhere
[1:37:42] that satan can't go sister satan can't
[1:37:44] go with us
[1:37:48] he can't make your legs hurt that bad
[1:37:51] where we're going but lord i pray that
[1:37:53] he'll give you a little touch of it
[1:37:55] right now
[1:37:56] any of us that are sick i hope he gives
[1:37:58] you a little touch
[1:37:59] brother branham said that was a what a
[1:38:02] mini resurrection
[1:38:04] when you get healed it's a mini
[1:38:06] resurrection
[1:38:08] but we're not going to be like lazarus
[1:38:09] folks we're not going to die again
[1:38:11] we're going up we're getting out of here
[1:38:15] but we got to get this right first find
[1:38:18] out where those two spirits are and
[1:38:19] discern to stay away from one
[1:38:22] and that's the bad one discern it stay
[1:38:25] away from it
[1:38:27] you love the lord let's bow our hands
[1:38:32] to heavenly father we thank you for this
[1:38:33] day that you give us we pray that you
[1:38:35] would sanctify us lord for our journey
[1:38:37] we know that one thing's for sure that
[1:38:38] as soon as we walk out the door the
[1:38:39] devil's going to be right there
[1:38:42] but we know that greater is he that's in
[1:38:44] us than he that's in the world
[1:38:45] there is nothing that satan can do to my
[1:38:47] soul lord
[1:38:49] after you sealed it in by the baptism of
[1:38:51] the holy ghost let's hope that every
[1:38:53] i pray that everyone realizes that lord
[1:38:57] he can play with all emotions he can
[1:38:58] play with our
[1:39:00] uh corporal bodies all he wants to but
[1:39:02] lord down inside
[1:39:05] let me say as horatio spafford said
[1:39:10] it is well with my soul
[1:39:14] it is well it is well
[1:39:18] with my soul because in his humanity he
[1:39:22] was hurting
[1:39:23] he was lonely
[1:39:27] probably had many nights he cried
[1:39:28] himself to sleep
[1:39:29] [Music]
[1:39:32] but he knew that anchor was inside
[1:39:35] and that anchor held and did he'd see
[1:39:38] his kids again
[1:39:40] he'd see all of his loved ones and he
[1:39:43] wrote that song
[1:39:44] it is well it is well with my soul
[1:39:49] be with us lord take care of us we come
