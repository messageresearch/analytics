read your word you come and speak to our hearts and we desire your love and grace among us is what we search after and we commit it all now to you in jesus name amen ephesians then we'll go to titus 2. that should be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the blood in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he had to bound it toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasures which he had purposed in himself to do what that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory he first trusted in christ now let's go over to titus we'll read verse 11 through 14 titus 2. for the grace of god that bring us salvation hath appeared to all men teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust we should live soberly and righteously and godly in this present world looking for that blessed hope and glorious appearing of the great god and our savior jesus christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works you may be seated the lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now i hope you brought back your quotes because that's what we were having our sunday there's only about 20 of these of each one so if you have yours from sunday just don't take these and you know but if you don't have them then you know because that's what we we were trying to try to get on sunday but we we got too far along in trying to express some things and you know then we didn't get into the notes that we have but anyhow we'll try to get on to that tonight and try to express our point now we read here in the scriptures about the redemption all right and uh you know we were trying to cover their sunday and i'll just review just a little bit that the word redeem means to you know to bring back or restore to original condition but then other words in there that we would take with that is uh you know it brings us to a concept or a thought see like the word redeem would be going backward you know and that's what i've i've tried to express to you that uh if we can talk about predestination and we can talk and go forward in predestination and and look forward to great things to take place on down through the endless eternities or the revealing of god's word you know and i believe that and that's wonderful but then if you can't take that same predestination and go back just as far as you can go forward then uh where would you what would you have uh you know you can't uh say well you know well now i just want to be redeemed back so far well uh you got a problem because the the the word redeem means to go back where you come from but now we're in as paul calls it in hebrews and colossians and all he calls it in hebrews 9 verse about 15 he calls it eternal redemption amen that's right now eternal redemption all right now the word as i said redeemed means to go back the word redeemed i gave the definition to you on the back of your your uh one of your your notes there you know and you can look at it and you'll see what the words are dealing with because the word redemption the word redeem means to go back all right the word redeemed is the past tense of that that can be dealing or showing it finished and the word redemption is a process that's going on the to to bring us to a condition and you know a position here on earth and that's definitely what we want to do but we got down to a point and i i didn't get to i don't think i got this far because i was just trying to explain the difference between redeem and redemption and and and you know and if you'll notice you'll find a lot that we'll get back to the end at the end of the message but in each one of the definitions if you'll read that you'll find that it has the word ransom involved in it all right and ransom is what is given in exchange for the price of redemption all right we'll get to that in a little while but see the point i've tried to make to you is and we put a whole two or three messages there on people saying you know and believing well well brother i i i've got the quotes i always was eternal well i believe that of what the prophet is talking about but i don't believe it as the definition of what people have to my way of looking at it has made it to turn out to be because if you say you always was eternal then there was no reason for jesus christ to die that that's that's a simple statement that's not something that you have to have a a 12th grade education or a college degree or some kind of something to understand it's just plain language that you know that if you you uh say i come into the world with eternal life then jesus christ never had to die right amen all right and then you you've been the same people that would talk about always was eternal they'll talk about redemption well now if you would always was eternal what would you need redemption for that's right do you understand what i'm saying if you if you say always was eternal then why would you even be dealing with the word redemption because the word redeemed would mean to go back where you come from well if you always was eternal where would you go back to see as you begin to analyze our thoughts a lot of times and we just take quotes of the prophet and scriptures to our own uh benefit and in our own thinking we don't realize that we we cross ourselves up so much until you know it's it's not even sensible about what we're saying now i pre preached to you over and over to show you and we gave them where the prophet was saying if you have eternal life you always was eternal all right i believe in that what i believe the eternal life you have right always was eternal but i believe there was a time you had to receive eternal life before you had it all right now as far as god is concerned that's one situation but as far as we're concerned as another and the prophet said you start your eternal life right here at the all right amen well see then but get the point of what i'm saying see i believe what he's saying i believe we're just taking the wrong thoughts about what is being said thanks to just say well well i i just believe what the prophet said you know i i i i i always was eternal we don't need the new birth you don't need anything if you always was eternal like that but the eternal life that you have always was eternal because it's only one form of eternal life all right and like i covered we that like the foolish virgin one day after watching judgment they'll be given eternal life well they spent their whole life in the world and all of the things in existence and finally at the ending of all things they will come forth and receive eternal life well why can't we see that we we were born in sin shape and iniquity sprouts from our mother's womb went forth lost doomed and on her way to hell and needed a savior needed a ransom pay for us to work that he could transmit his eternal life to us and you don't get eternal life just by saying well you know i just want it it has to be imparted unto us all right and see then if you believe that it's imparted unto you then you can believe that it's a possibility that you can be redeemed amen amen all right now see then that way your plan of redemption is in the full view and surely we don't believe this type of person we're looking at here of the human elements the prophet said that had a beginning and see it must one day be made eternal all right now if your body was not eternal this is something i'm gonna say and then i'm not gonna say anymore i'm just gonna make the point all right i do this a lot because i i just click that into your thinking and then you'll go home and you'll consider it but see your body was not eternal the new birth don't give you eternal life in your body all right now what are we going to do dealing with redemption in that did you hear what i said it where are you going to redeem your body to right just let you think a little ahead of time all right now what have we been dealing with we've been dealing with the basis that god by his foreknowledge could look down through time and see each person and that way he could predestinate that person because of his foreknowledge of seeing what we would desire so he would see that your desire to be saved when it's the other person wouldn't receive it because of the way that it would be brought now there's not a person in the world i don't believe there's ever been a person in the world at all that wouldn't in some way want eternal life now i i just i don't i don't think like that i think everybody wants a happy hunting ground you know the old indian to go to i think everybody wants that but the price of being to receive it is the reason we don't like it and don't want it we said we have to give up too much well i don't believe you give up anything to be a christian i i'm you know i don't believe that but that's what we think right but we better do this and do that to be a christian now we need to get born again but still see there is things that comes along with being given up and a lot of people are not willing to do that right so thereby they won't never receive eternal life because they're not willing to give it up but you see if god if god could look down through and see then he can predestinate according to his foreknowledge and and it wouldn't be him with respect to persons but he would know what would take place upon the earth all right but then we started dealing then that the prophet said everything is forgained by foreknowledge right right everything that ever happened in the world every person would ever be in the world ever that would ever you know bat its eye and all of this that and the other by god's foreknowledge he would know all about that if not he's not god so then we don't have to worry about nothing anyway maybe we're the god you know maybe we're smarter than than any kind of uh you know doings or whatever you know no i don't think so but anyhow but we did get down to covering what that it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from god but to see their word right all right now so then every person would be predestinated by foreknowledge right amen that's sensible isn't it amen if there is a god if he knows all things and like i said if he don't then we gotta worry about it but we know we do now so then we come down to the basis of seeing that it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally that's right i don't care what you think you are or who you think you are how great you are you come in the world lost if not we don't need a redeemer right right but you see why people they'll build a statement yet you're just on that old school of thought well that old school is held far enough and it's been here all the way through and i don't have to worry about it because i'm a firm believer that you must be born again i'm a firm believer that you must receive eternal life to have it yes but you just don't believe all the quotes well bring them and let's see i took them over and over and over then references through you do you show through messages but if you have eternal life you always was eternal what the eternal life always was he came in but there was a day i didn't have that it had to be given unto me all right but then we come down to believe if paul said in hebrews that there's an eternal redemption that's right all right so then there's something that's eternal there's something predestinated eternally from god now here's the point i want you to see though because something is predestinated eternally does it give that eternal life well yeah if it's predestinated eternally then it didn't no because the word or seed is predestinated eternally but that don't make the word or seed eternal he said well that's that's getting down show me how to say it any other way that word you receive has got to be made alive then it's eternal because if not paul is facing you was saying the letter right come on the letter kill it but the spirit giveth life all right so then we must deal with the fact of seeing that the word is what's predestinated eternally all right now then to believe in redemption right then it would mean that something did at one time exist but it became lost or you're not dealing with the word redemption right so if you come with eternal i see then you would never lost see that's what people want to see they want to see some great glory or something like that and it said but you're just dealing with them old ways of things well i'll just stay there you just going down the road and we'll meet down one of these days and find out what's right but you see to redeem something means it had to beat our somewhere and then lost or you wouldn't be redeeming it when it says redeem right it means to do over again that's why jesus told nicodemus you must be born again because your first birth was wrong all right so now we're to believe that our first birth is wrong but yet there was something about us and i don't see why this wouldn't thrill our souls you know people say well this you know you just don't you you just make it so dry until i don't get excited about it but brother so and so he just says a few words and i just get all elated what'd he say we said i can't explain it i just believed it i always was eternal well see then you go ahead and deal with that yourself but you see i believe that you must be born again amen but there was something about you that would make the plan of redemption come into view to where you can return now everybody right around said everybody wasn't in god's predestination to be able to return only only the elect right can be redeemed right but see do you understand what i'm saying then if you're gonna deal with redemption now if you're not gonna deal with these things just forget it go home be happy and just just you know but if you're gonna talk about redemption if you're going to preach we always was eternal don't preach nothing about redemption because you don't need to be redeemed right but brother dale how is it that that we could be something and then be lost that's a good question because if you don't see that then you can't see it and understand the word redeem because you see then if you can see that it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally it's the word or seed right all right so now what was it before the world right is the word of seed but it became lost no no no no wait just a minute how can the word be lost well you explain to me what it is i'm open for suggestions that word it wasn't lost like thrown away lost but the prophet of god said all right in the seal message that when man sinned he said the book went back to the hand of the one that owned the book and watched the book the word the seed that's right so there was no way to bring it forth there was no way to bring forth the word right because it was lost all right now if the word was lost see then that word can be brought back if it was god's word right but if it's our ideas now come on you ain't dealing with redemption right right yeah all right our ideas don't melt anything but see then that way you could look back and see the word and see how that word would come forth and then see the mankind on earth that was supposed to become that word and see the fallen condition all right now see brother randall says look at you look at your notes on number two there who is this melchizedek he said you bypass the theophany that's right it causes the outnea word body all right i gave you one and then this one on on paragraph 70 in the same message so you bypass the theophany and become flesh man to be tempted by sin all right now it may have i don't i think the notes or the numbers are still the same with what you hit sunday but anyhow what did you bypass he became the word all right jesus christ almighty god now not jesus the flesh okay all right jesus christ almighty god became the word the theophany the word body he calls it if you're reading it you're reading it see that's what people do they'll quote brother brown out of away from what he's saying and and try to make it some doctrinal thought now you showed me where he wrote around said you bypassed the word all right he if you bypass the word then you have no hopes of ever being redeemed because if the word if you wasn't a part of the word before the world ever begun when are you going to become part of the word right you see people quote said you bypass the word i want you to show me that how could you bypass the word and be part of the word before the world begun and if you're not part of the word before the world begun you never will be that's right amen if you're not part of the work before the world you never will be the word man i see we ought to get down and settle down and listen and not just take our ideas because i've listened to people explaining that for 35 or 40 years now you baptize the word you bypass the word to become flesh jesus didn't bypass it that's right amen but how many quotes do you want from brother brown that if we wasn't in jesus we'll never be there amen if we wasn't a part of the word before the world begun we never will be part of the word but you see that you take your own concept or thought about what's being said let's read what brotherhood said on progress 67 who is this melchizedek now we see the attribute sons of his spirit have not yet entered into the word form body are you listening word form body you just say you bypass the word right he said you've not yet entered into the word form body the theophany said but a theophany this body is subject to the word and earnestly waiting for the earnest change of the body now the difference between him and you is a son see he was at the beginning the word an immorphy body he came in and lived in that in the person of melchizedek you never heard of more melchizedek because it became jesus christ melchizedek was the priest but he became jesus christ now you bypass that because in that form he knowed all things and you've never been able to know that yet now let's analyze what he's saying oh but i just believe it i just believe it believe what you know your soul is hinged upon one word it only took one word to bring us out of this situation in the garden and we're not going back with one word off right right but brother hell you just don't understand god he's uh i know it but i understand what he's saying jesus came in a word formed body that's where it was when you create the world now that's a body right so we never came in a word form body right amen that's sensible amen he said well we bypass the word show me where he says it he said we bypass the word foreign body we apply past the amorphy body the theophany but if we wasn't in him we never will be in him if we wasn't in jesus christ when he was in that word form body will never be in him is that sensible do you need a lot of quotes for that if you wouldn't a part of the words you never would be part of the word they wrote over in the message well see why did we buy pies and we take bye pies like 285 goes around atlanta you know that's the only word that the way we can you know put a definition on both eyes or either it's like something you come up to then you got to move over and then you got to move out and you move so you bypassed why don't you just sit in plain language you didn't come that way is that sensible enough that's right would that mean we bypassed it we just didn't come that way we didn't come what way we didn't come in a word formed body an immorphy amen that's right we didn't come that way but i keep saying if we wasn't in him we will never be no word see when he came we was in him i thought that's what we believed where the scripture says i you and you and me i ain't using to understand people say oh get the new word but what about me and you and you and you and me but you see we got all these thoughts and ideas that comes along about sarah and abraham and nissan and that one and adam and eve you know according to my understanding adam come here with eve in him right eve didn't come here with adam and her when jesus christ came into the world if we have eternal life right that eternal life that he had is now in you amen that's right because back there when he stood there as a theosony body the creator they said let that be all right we had to be in him but we never came a word for body he said we become the word here read who is this mountain we become the word here he was the word all right he was the creator that logos theophany whatever you want to call it speech that came out from god was a part of god or god in another form called the word that created the world there he was then this was hard for you to say but there was jesus christ now you know what i say about it jesus was the only name god ever had christ means the anointing not jesus the flesh when you say jesus everybody thinks about flesh no no no no no it was the only name god ever had what was the name of that angel of the covenant in the old testament said beware of him because my name is in him what was his name his name was jesus so when i say jesus christ i mean almighty god the eternal see he never bypassed that he came that away but it was one body all right now he came from god over into that form as we want to call it right stepped over into a form or whatever you want to call it you know to bring him forth because it's the same god but you see we didn't get to do that now listen very carefully that was not the fall the fall was not when we couldn't come that way you know it didn't come that way that's not to fall god was fully intending to bring every one of us exactly the way that original son was brought forth would you agree because he knew that if he put that man on earth he would not fall there was no way that that man could fall that i'm talking about right that man christ jesus that in morphy that theophany man that word he couldn't fall to us not to fall because we didn't come that way but it did put us where we could be redeemed right right but by whitney so then we didn't get to come the way that man came did you catch what i said that man in that condition that word that son of god theophany loco was god in another form right that's right called a son there was no way for him to fall don't ever make him fall but because that we didn't step out there right then in the same condition he was in he brought us into a condition come on are you listening when he stepped out there he was the word he would be eternal god there's no way he could fall even putting him in flesh which was making the connection to the human right the desires the thoughts the things of of life but there was no way he could fall because he's a word to start with right but you see we didn't get to come that way why because this same one had attributes of a savior of a healer those attributes were already a part of him right that's right i've told you over and over he didn't gain attributes as he came this way those attributes were just as real as could ever be the only way you'll ever be redeemed is to see it that way he had those attributes and those attributes were a part of him there was no way that it could ever be it wasn't going to come that way so he never intended to set us there like him he could not display his attributes had he done that because it had never been anybody lost it had never been anybody sick that had never been any problem right right because that theophany man standing there that god in a human form as we want to call it you know look like a human the prophet said had better eyes better ears if we think of a theologian is not having anything i used to preach it that way until i got corrected i'd say your soul has no faculties in it but then i come to find out the prophet said when you go beyond the curtain of time in that way in a theophany in your soul and it connects he said it's got all of the senses i had it wrong and i had to admit i had it wrong but do you follow what i'm saying now is everybody with me this whether you believe it or not i'm just saying ask god to reveal it when that man that we call the christ if you want to call him that the theophany man he was in a one one-form amorphy body right the word what there was no way it could fall no possibility for a fall to exist had he brought that away there would have been no possibility of a fall but he didn't choose to bring us that way he chose for us to come here and be tempted the prophet calls it who is it who to spell chapter he said we come here to be as humans to be tempted of sin see he knew we were going to fall he couldn't make us fall but he knew we were going to fall so instead of bringing us here as that theophany man to stand there like him we might fight staff but keep in your mind don't ever forget if we wasn't in him we never will be in him so that's the only way you're going to find redemption i don't think i'll get that far tonight but we'll go as far as we can but listen he didn't devise a plan he just did what we do he knew all he had to do was just put us here his mortals you know god's got confidence in us you think of it that way he's got confidence in us he knows what we can do he knew if he ever put us here we'd fall amen all right what'd he do then that eternal god that word began to create make a world etc etc made all the animals made all the things and then to show that he was still trying to keep it in the right channel and was not the author of sin he made a man named adam right he made a body spirit in a soul and he called him adam right and then he placed according to blasphemous names he breathed the breath of eternal life into adam's nostrils and adam became a living soul um so there was adam the man that was made to rule the garden right and that spiritual extent of man to rule the garden but then one day made him in flesh still didn't create him wrong created perfect still tracking to make sure everything would stay in the right channel he gave that man eternal life you can argue all you want to he must have gave it to eve when she came because brother branham said and you just quote all you want to i know what brother running said he said eve was in adam and theophany so all right forget it that's right you can argue all you want to ain't going to argue with you about it because inside of adam was eve amen not in a sinful condition right no way another random i know what he says he said see there satan was her designer now he didn't design her god was eve's designer come on you said what the prophet said satan was satan took over after god got her here he didn't desire wrong god never made her playing language so hot nature she couldn't stand it he didn't do that right sorry for the wording but it'll get the point across he made her perfect he took part out of adam and made a body right he created a spirit and a soul and put it in that body and like i said i believe she had eternal life but yet she was not a lesser degree but the only difference between adam and eve was one thing adam stood there as the word right adam was the word he had eternal life he could control the animals in his spiritual condition then in his natural condition he still had the rule of the animals and he had eternal life that's why he wasn't deceived brother lee vale he used to preach it in this good point but you know how you want to carry it that's up to you but he said we talk about that beast and eve he said what about the female beast running around after adam right but see there's no way to get adam to sin he was too close to god i just wish we could get there for one little inch and get away from this sinful condition and i believe one day we will but see he wouldn't listen he was the word all right what else are you going to call them but see when eve come along the only part of her that wasn't in the correct top order with adam well she was taken from adam's body and made a byproduct now not that god made her wrong that's right we call her a hybrid now how could god make a hype written be just right i've heard that preached over and over and more look at our adder she just made a hybrid show it took me the prophet's message show it to me in the bible how could god make a hybrid god made horses and and donkeys and man put them together and made a mule that didn't come from god right he wasn't the creator of the mule he allowed it but you see adam and eve standing in the garden in a beautiful position but what's eve now you got to remember what she was now don't get this in the wrong realm i believe adam was body spirit and soul and then god gave him eternal life well what would he have done with eve see because i know what a lot of people thinks about it and they'll go ahead and preach it anyway they think that she was made such a much lower until she didn't have no huh your prophet said it i didn't he said she was co-equal don't do what you want to she was co-equal with adam the only difference between adam and eve was adam's body was spoken pure by the word of god eve's body was a secondary in the basis that he brought it out of adam but you know how i pre-set and i believe it that makes her actually greater than adam in the extent of one thing he took part of adam to make eve he didn't take part of the earth to make eve he took part of adam to make ease don't make it such a wrong thing make it the right story but you see she began to do one thing and you say now you can't do that with eternal life you're full of garbage cans all i got to say you're sitting there right now reasoning in your mind what i'm talking about you're sitting there right now trying to figure out what i'm saying and what's going on and you have eternal life blessing oh i don't ask for a regular hand but how many of you got eternal life hey man you had a bad thought today you done any reasoning lately that was wrong i saw what happened ever oh how these was she just turned to her reasoning that's right she wasn't no different she was the same product i believe that she come from adam that's right oh my brother brown said she's a byproduct you know what is about product you ever looked it up in dictionary how many have you ever looked up with the word byproduct you don't go and get your dictionary tonight look at it it says a thing of equal value are greater value oh look up the word my brush do we think my product is like adam was a great big porterhouse steak you know but he was a piece of dog meat and you show me that but that's the way it's preached in this message see that's why we're still here 40 years later i don't mind talking like that that's why we're here 40 years later because it's the hardest thing in the world to get people to realize what what adam and eve was in the garden and how beautiful position they was in the only problem with these was she begin to reason you know what she wanted to hit god because that's the way satan approached her you know yours made for this look at all the other animals in the female position and you were made for this place adam just won't tell you that all right come on she began to reason and as she reasoned she lost her holy position right the bible said she was deceived which means she didn't know better right she thought she was doing right playing blood language you mean a woman would receive an animal and and they don't realize it wrong come on get sensible look at it sensibly she thought she was doing right you tell a woman preacher today she's not called to preach that's right right she'll tell you in a hurry that god called her and she'll show you signs and wonders and she'll show you great things that's happened in her ministry like that lady years ago that brought him up never knew she said well i've never seen anything greater than brother branham's ministry except my own you're not going to change nothing i wasn't the one that made the statement your prophet did and you know what he thought of women he loved good women but he said you're one thousand times easier to be deceived that ain't got nothing to do with your education your smart ability and how much you know about computers and i'm a dummy with them that don't have anything to do with it it means you're easier to be deceived slick tongue man talking to you and telling you how pretty you are telling you how beautiful you are and how that your husband has not been a husband to you he's yeah slick tongue come on but be sensible about it just think about it once she started reasoning that brought the sin in the picture lust when it's conceived lust is not sin come on lust when it's conceived bringeth for sin sin when it's finished brings death right all right but you see so eve then brought to mankind and adam you know loving his wife desiring not to lose her because he knew immediately that she was dead you didn't have to be told what she done was wrong you want a dummy right but he knew that she was dead sure she was walking around yeah but he knew what she'd done was wrong he walked out of the garden with her you say that was the type of christ that's all right you can use that as the top of christ but don't talk too much there because christ didn't become sinful now adam became sinful so be careful how you type well i gotta type here brother be careful just keep reading your time because jesus christ never becomes sinful to redeem us he took upon himself the form of sinful man see then what is it he bypay i mean we bypass that word because had we stepped down in that word form wouldn't there have been no sin even adam stepped out of there in a condition that there was no sin right right there was no sinning adam but when he stepped forth in the next party and started her reasoning there was no sin in her when she was created right you can't make glory after a sin when she started reasoning upon god's there's your sin god knew before the world that all he had to do was just put us here in a perfect state and we'd fall i thank god for his promises you know what so that if god don't move on the scene in a little bride in the end time and take her out of here because he promised her he'd do it we would dive in and fall it's oh no oh yes because the thing that's in that mind telling you oh no is the very thing that was in the garden talking to eve if it wasn't for god's promises you and i wouldn't be stepping out of here in a rapture i don't deal up on some kind of this i deal up on what he promised my salvation is based upon what god promised but you see then that's why we never come like adam we didn't come like adam that's right and we come like adam stay in that condition of adam there's been no fault so he made one more step he made a church called eve made her right perfect but he knew what she'd do he knew how easily she would be deceived so he has not a snake crawling around right but an upright creature a beast that could talk to eve and begin to reason with her and i don't believe it was a five minute of fire no telling how long that that process went on we just read that he talked to him you know it could have been hundreds of years involved you say oh i don't know well one would be enough don't have to worry about it one whole day would be enough but you see she had to thank things out that's right right she thought she was right well brother dale i gotta write today brother brother said that's where the wrong was in the garden now you need to quote he said she said i think if i was you sisters i'm just as honest as i can be i would try to find my right place in god you know how i preach and the way i've always preached to you i believe the sisters have got their right place in god to believe and serve god and to raise a family and all other things like that i believe in that i've always preached it to you so don't misunderstand me now but if i was your sisters i'd find my place i'd get before god and i'd cry out to find my place and brothers do you realize the prophet said she'll never have to answer for you right that's right but said you'll have to answer for her that's right oh of course now i've seen that too but god you straighten up prophet sat on the head this house now you show me that in christ i've seen some of you and everything that i thought needed to a little correct but also look past into the line and see what's there god gave me that ability years ago to be able to look past what i see if he had not done condemned every one of us to hell i look down and see a desire in a person i deal with that more than i do what you doing and i would do that but listen so then we must have been in jesus christ he was here in a word form body a theophany an amorphy and he said we come to earth and we bypass that word form body we come here to be tempted of sin but you see by the fact that we was in jesus christ means we can be redeemed because everybody wasn't in jesus christ now come on go all the way back in your foreknowledge the way we've been bringing it god by his foreknowledge knew who would want to be saved and who wouldn't and he sent jesus christ to pay the price amen cry that's right everybody will never be redeemed because everybody wouldn't predestinate it everybody's predestinated by four knowledge yes but everybody's not a predestinated seed right our word see by being in jesus christ back there in that word body we can be redeemed because redeemed means to go back to where you come from all right now how far do you want to go back and what part of you do you want to talk about redemption because we were not in jesus in bodily form back there in the theophany now the prophet will bring it down and he'll say we walk the shores of galilee and jesus we we dive in him we've rose in him we've done this that and the other but now you know with plain common sense he's not talking about your body if you don't know that about playing common sense please get some you want an idiom in body what were we he said in non-seed there's nothing to quicken that's right if you didn't become seed by the rebirth you were seed and could be born again the seed is the only thing that can be redeemed so until we get back sunday with it let's just stop right there i don't mean quit the sermon i said stop right there with our progressive backward and just talk a little bit about because i gave them to you all over in the message the quotes brought around said we had to be a part of god or we never will be there that's right what does it mean to be a part of god to be a part of god to be part of the eternal god you remember i told you years ago in preaching on it be careful how you redeem because you can redeem yourself clean out of existence then we don't found out if you believe you come in the world always was eternal and you don't need a savior and all like that then you don't believe in redemption so if you don't believe in redemption you can't be redeemed so if redeemed means what it means to go back where you come from then when the lord jesus christ says that theophany word son of the living god the creator when he stood on earth if we wasn't in him we never will be in him it's impossible to be any other thing we if we wouldn't in him we can't be in him so then do you see where you can be redeemed back to you can be redeemed back to what you bypass but you know what i like about it not going to be redeemed back that away this is another thing that we're going to have to deal a little bit with because you see what was back there has got to come here right here is where we get our redemption we don't have to go to heaven to be eternal we start it right here but if we wasn't in jesus christ then there's no way to be redeemed do we become here to what word born body because that's what jesus was we become the word here the prophet said as you receive the word you're becoming the word see so let's quit looking over there let's quit looking back there and start looking here now amen the rest of the message tonight keep your thoughts right here now we become here what he was down and when he died i died in him resurrected i resurrected any or else i'm not a part of it so eternal life never had a beginning never had an indie but see you and i came into this world once the fall came you couldn't have made abel cain or whoever would be coming forth you couldn't make them with eternal life that's why it's not spoke of anymore the whole old testament you don't find eternal life coming into position as a believer with eternal life that's why abraham was god's servant doesn't call him god's son he was his servant those old testament saints were servants of god but when the new birth came on the day of pentecost it's sons of god amen amen even when we leave out of here in a rapture 144 thousand listen we'll receive eternal life right right right but you know what they're called they're named and said hold those wars until the servants were sealed in their forehead and when we go the prophet said to the millennium 144 000 will be their servants to the right even though they have eternal life so being sons and daughters of god is a lot to be said so then you don't see that theophany spoke of except when you come down later to melchizedek you see it in forms or ways of the angel of the covenant or something but then to melchizedek when he came to abraham to bring the promises and things literally said you see no more of melchizedek because he became jesus christ the melchizedek had no beginning of days and no ending of life jesus's body had a beginning and had a time that had to be made eternal melchizedek that body outside was not melchizedek melchizedek was the emorphy god standing inside of there like aaron said you take a little dust and potash and patrol him sprinkle it around the theophany you got melchizedek but you see folks the prophet said we become the word here that's right we've got to become what jesus was when he was walking when he was back there as you create on that's right but you see if we was there in him we can be redeemed back to there are you listening listen folks we were standing there not as people not his body spirit soul like we look at it right that's what we want we want some kind of a feeling with background the problem said you didn't know anything about it said was your spirit he said no you wouldn't nothing you're just in his mind but it was in his mind was in his mind he knew what was going to take place that's why when the morning star sang together in the book of job the sons of god shouted for joy brought around said it was when they saw the plan of redemption come into view he said maybe that was when the lamb stood as a slain before the foundation of the world but brother dale i believe that when i come into this world i had something different you know where the prophet said it was put i ask you that question that's in your notes as a matter of fact it's in there twice i repeated it and unintentionally but i think it was a good intention i thank his broken sister he said where was it put tire where was the seat putting you at he said before the foundation of the world i thought he put in there when i was born as a baby now your prophet said it was put there before the foundation lord you see that's what we've been taught all these years that's why it's so hard to preach the truth this took 40 years to get us away from the trinitarian concept right amen we're finally beginning to realize wasn't that what the prophet is was bringing out sunday he said that little eagle he said little eagle could be an eagle for a long time before a son of god could be a son of god before he recognizes you know that little eagle was never born to chicken they didn't put a chicken egg under that chicken and they passed it out and it become an eagle they put an eagle egg when you're born again you're born again as a child of god but it may take you a long time read the stories it takes you a long time to recognize let me quote brother branham the last message he preached is the only time he made this statement he said i see now that i am not the son of charles and ella branham 40-something years the man preached the gospel something that wouldn't because he started preaching before the ohio river not seen it that would have been 33. but one day he said i'm not the son of y'all to never bring him i realize i come from god you know if you come from god you've got to go back to god there's redeemed that's right see jesus now watch it and i'll finish when jesus was here he said i come from god i go back to god now that body come from god as a creation but that body was made eternal right so he wasn't dealing with his physical body he was dealing with a great higher more than ever a theophany body a word body and see we bypass being that that's what we're doing here now you're becoming a word body now it's what you're doing he was the son of man he was a sort of name let me let me get something just finish up with it and if i can find it i wrote it down look in job while i'm turning somebody may have to help me find it there because i get it written in my nose joke 33. if you're going to talk about redemption you know what you got to have you got to have somebody to be able to pay ransom right so if you gotta have somebody pay ransom that means you've lost right see i love this i remember preaching on it many many years ago job 33 and 24. 33 23. if there be a messenger with him an interpreter one among a thousand to show unto man his uprightness then he is gracious unto him and saith deliver him from going down to the pit i have found a ransom job wanted somebody to be able to stand between god and him and pull him together you've heard the prophet explain that right look in matthew 20 you'll see that i am trying to study on something but i get tied up and trying to preach about it and i just lose all thoughts try to preach what the lord gives me so look at matthew 20. now remember job said i've found a ransom somebody that can pay the price matthew 20 and 28. even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and give his life a ransom for many all right now we wouldn't lost why do we need a ranch in exodus 20 30 and verse 12 you'll find that they were dealing back there with a rant some money it had to be paid for each soul you'll find in psalms 49 and verse 7 that no man can pay this ransom it took god to pay the ransom but job said i found a ransom i found somebody that can redeem me he pay the price so everybody just stay with me like i'm saying here's the piece of paper holding them on tape just stop right here with me that if we wasn't in jesus christ when he was at work theophany we can never be there but if we were there we can be redeemed work to that that we didn't get to come right that's right we only want to deal with redeem as like trying to make something oh redeem me i'm going back oh boy i blessed i was up there and i was just walking around this and the other night redeem means to go back where you come from so we was in jesus when he was there as the creator god the theophany the word body we had to be part of the word or we never will be but we never come in that word body form we do that here here's where the eternal life starts and here's where the theophany has to come forward into its final manifestation to step us across there that's why i believe that when you're born again your soul is your theophany i know what the work theophany is dealing with dealing with the body of a god i thank god for that i don't want to be the body of a god of some other kind that's right right amen i want to be the body that god lives in amen take on these things redeem so we keep we believe then that we were in jesus christ and had there not been a fallen condition of existence come into being we would have just stepped out there and been a wonderful place but there was what attributes in our savior our god that he wanted to display so he permitted us to come into a place that he knew that when we did we would take on the wrong thing and like i've always tried to say you can believe all the how spiritual you are but just remember no man is a match for the devil and that's what your prophet says the holy ghost is the only one who can handle him the holy ghost would come on down and be christ which would be michael and remember the well priesthood here while back even you go back to the book of daniel and you'll find that gabriel a great archangel of gabriel that could deliver messages but he couldn't whoop the devil he had to call michael on the scene christ had to come you're no match for the devil it don't make no difference who you think you are right when you think you are you're right in the trap of the devil like i told you the man that worked there one day said i'm not working on commanding the devil anymore no you're not he said no i'm working on commanding god where's the scripture he said where it says there command ye me that don't mean that you're commanding him it means you're just asking him and believing it'll take place i'm working on commanding the lord so i worked on getting away from it and i never discussed anything with him again why because if he was that far then let him go i'm sorry i love people but you're gonna get in the butthole if you start trying to back up in there with them that's right but don't do it that's where we go 15 in the red bull 15. i am again but now my soul is saved i'm in the process of redemption of the body because it had a beginning it's gonna be redeemed talking about ability to go back say we should be redeemed oh oh in you that you'll take care of all the needs of whatever it is how oh we thank you it evidently worked maybe that's what we ought to do put them in your prayer blog you know i mean you're you're a medical captain you open the door where i mentioned there heard don't worry about it we'll cut up some more handkerchiefs put them there and believe it could not believe it we had one one stand he got his still under his watch because he went through an operation and we had a story years ago you first tell about it just these people were in prison and this girl had had them to pray for her you know and brought her a breath cloth when she'd go to sleep at night and to sleep all night and some of the others you know because of the bad things that was in the prison would you know they they couldn't sleep and so you know they asked her how could she sleep and she told them their secret well you know what that girl asked her said well there's any way that i could borrow that prayer cloth no she said okay so she took the prayer ball from the lady you know she put it on her she went to bed went to sleep you know what happened the one that give her the prayer cloth stayed up all night see it's what you believe this is no joke this happened in prisons it's what you believe so believe it and go on with it and thank god for it because we've seen god what he can do let's sing one more before we go jesus say me is is give her peace everybody and we thank you i have some is why can't we you know what i did and every time my bible and all who have asked me to pray think about it i can take everything and just work it out somebody else i the uh is going on one day let's just take a little bit of time let's sing that one before we go that's what we want to do gave us all right oh and what it is now me but he don't want us to think about god is oh at the the world of to dreams oh me
