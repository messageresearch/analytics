[22:32] he's a
[22:36] his mom
[22:37] is a mail carrier
[22:39] yes
[22:40] works with
[22:41] wade and
[22:43] uh
[22:44] her second oldest boy is the same age as
[22:47] um
[22:48] levi
[22:49] and they have been
[22:51] buddies since
[22:54] diapers i guess
[22:56] been a long time so
[22:58] but uh
[22:59] i guess they were just a month just a
[23:01] few months old i don't know if they were
[23:02] i don't know if they were
[23:04] i don't know if they were walking yet
[23:05] but they've been together for a long
[23:07] time but anyway they're they're real
[23:09] good friends so
[23:11] he's with us tonight so
[23:13] um
[23:14] daniel chapter 5 of verse 8 verse 18
[23:17] starting
[23:18] and here's daniel and we know the
[23:21] scripture daniel speaking
[23:25] to
[23:26] belshazzar
[23:28] who was the king after nebuchadnezzar
[23:30] and he's and he's speaking
[23:33] because this is where the handwriting on
[23:35] the wall comes in
[23:37] the unknown writing and they were
[23:39] looking for somebody that can interpret
[23:43] and daniel says oh thou king the most
[23:45] high god gave nebuchadnezzar thy father
[23:49] which actually i think if you look it up
[23:50] is actually his grandfather
[23:52] but the the scripture father there
[23:54] actually means can be referring to
[23:56] grandfather also
[23:58] says gave nebuchadnezzar thy father a
[24:00] kingdom and majesty and glory and honor
[24:04] and for the majesty that he gave him all
[24:06] people nations and languages trembled
[24:09] and feared
[24:10] before him
[24:12] whom he would
[24:14] he slew and whom he would he kept alive
[24:17] in whom he would
[24:18] he set up and whom he would he put down
[24:22] but when his heart was lifted up and his
[24:24] mind hardened and pride he was disposed
[24:27] from his kingly throne and they took his
[24:29] glory from him
[24:31] and he was driven from the sons of men
[24:33] and his heart was made like the beast
[24:36] and his dwelling was with the wild asses
[24:39] they fed him with grass like oxen and
[24:41] his body was wet with the dew of heaven
[24:44] till he knew that the most high god
[24:46] ruled in the kingdom of men that he
[24:49] appointed over
[24:50] it whomsoever he will
[24:53] but thou his son o belshazzar has not
[24:56] humbled thy heart though thou knewest
[24:59] all this now that's what i want you to
[25:00] look at he said he knew all of this
[25:04] remember remember the last time we were
[25:06] talking when we when when jesus in
[25:08] matthew tells him he said fill ye up
[25:11] the measure of your fathers
[25:14] because remember he said y'all
[25:16] polished the tombs
[25:18] of the ones that your fathers put in
[25:19] there
[25:21] he said but has lifted up thine cell up
[25:24] thyself against the lord of heaven and
[25:26] they have brought the vessels of his
[25:29] house before thee
[25:31] and thou and thy lords and the wives and
[25:33] the concubines have drunk wine in them
[25:36] and thou has praised the gods of silver
[25:38] and gold of brass iron wood and stone
[25:41] which see not nor hear nor no and the
[25:45] god in whose hand thy breath is and
[25:48] whose are all thy ways hast thou not
[25:51] glorified then was the part of the hand
[25:54] sent before him and this writing was
[25:57] written and this is the writing that was
[25:59] written many many tackle of sharon
[26:02] this is the interpretation of the thing
[26:04] many
[26:06] god hath numbered thy kingdom and
[26:07] finished it tackle thou art weighed in
[26:10] the balances and art found wanting paris
[26:13] thy kingdom is divided and given unto
[26:16] the medes and persians
[26:18] then commanded belshazzar and they
[26:20] clothed daniel with scarlet and put a
[26:23] chain of gold about his neck and made a
[26:25] proclamation concerning him that he
[26:27] should be the third ruler in the kingdom
[26:29] and that night was belshazzar the king
[26:31] of the chaldeans slain amen god bless
[26:34] you tonight you can have your seats
[26:38] and so
[26:40] i want to
[26:42] kind of
[26:43] look at this as a as a continuation
[26:49] and
[26:53] as jesus
[26:55] was telling the
[26:56] the scribes in the and the pharisees
[26:59] when they
[27:00] there in matthew 23 you know as was was
[27:03] speaking of last time when he began to
[27:05] speak to him and tell them about
[27:07] their
[27:08] work
[27:09] and you know they
[27:11] as they began to look at all of the
[27:13] the the fineries and all the things that
[27:15] they had in their
[27:18] and
[27:19] you know they were telling jesus
[27:21] you know
[27:23] what what you know what a great
[27:25] uh
[27:26] lineage we have and what a great
[27:28] reputation we have and all these things
[27:30] of what they come from and jesus said
[27:32] you know he said woe unto you scribes
[27:34] and pharisees
[27:36] he said because your fathers had heard
[27:39] the word
[27:41] he said through the prophets and the
[27:43] righteous
[27:44] and he said you slew them
[27:47] he said you put them in the graves and
[27:49] he said y'all go out there and you
[27:50] polish the tombs which they are in
[27:53] and he said you we know by your own
[27:56] testimony that you're of
[27:59] as we said last time we knew that you're
[28:01] of your father the devil
[28:03] you're of the of that language that
[28:05] natural language but also the spiritual
[28:06] image of the same ones because they
[28:08] didn't agree with the word and he began
[28:11] to point to the word and he said y'all
[28:12] don't believe the word
[28:14] but he said you stand there and say if
[28:15] we were back there in that day
[28:18] we wouldn't do the same things
[28:20] that our fathers done
[28:22] and jesus pointed out to him he said the
[28:24] word has been made manifest in a greater
[28:27] way
[28:27] in front of you and you've turned it
[28:29] down
[28:30] so you're just as guilty as they are
[28:33] and as we were speaking of last time in
[28:35] the scripture and uh ezekiel and
[28:38] jeremiah where he talks about the the
[28:41] fathers who ate the sour grapes and the
[28:43] t and the children
[28:45] teeth were set on edge
[28:47] and they want to go back and point to
[28:48] the to the fathers it's all their fault
[28:51] it was all their fault it's like no
[28:53] you can't use that scripture anymore
[28:55] because when the word was made real to
[28:57] you when the word is made manifest to
[29:00] you then you're responsible for it you
[29:02] can't look back to some other age
[29:05] because when the word is made manifest
[29:07] to you when the word when god opens your
[29:09] eyes to it then you're responsible for
[29:12] it
[29:14] and so
[29:15] we we look at this
[29:17] and
[29:18] i was thinking of of
[29:22] here in the in the scripture because
[29:24] you know when daniel's speaking of
[29:28] nebuchadnezzar you know when when
[29:30] nebuchadnezzar begins to speak
[29:33] and he and you know he was he had such a
[29:36] great kingdom as daniel talks about here
[29:39] he had this great kingdom that was
[29:41] rose up and god blessed him god rose him
[29:45] up for a purpose to do
[29:47] and you know he had all of that he had
[29:49] all these all this power and and
[29:51] authority and all these riches and and
[29:53] the all these different things he had
[29:55] all that but he was in god's hands
[29:57] because god put him in that position
[29:59] and you know we we see that later on
[30:02] when god
[30:04] had
[30:05] had the spirit to come upon him that he
[30:07] become just like an animal
[30:10] was out in the field eating grass and
[30:11] just a wild man
[30:13] had lost his mind
[30:17] but when god humbled nebuchadnezzar
[30:20] and he put him in that position when he
[30:22] came back see then he realized that you
[30:23] know i don't have control of this
[30:26] i'm not in control
[30:28] god is in control of this
[30:30] but see the rebuke that came to
[30:31] belshazzar
[30:33] and under that day is he said you saw
[30:35] those things
[30:38] you knew what happened to your
[30:40] grandfather
[30:41] you saw the condition that
[30:43] nebuchadnezzar was in
[30:45] and you saw that then all of a sudden
[30:48] realized nebuchadnezzar realized
[30:50] and gave homage to god because he
[30:53] realized you know i'm not in control god
[30:54] is
[30:56] but he said to belshazzar he said your
[30:58] problem is and the rebuke that came to
[31:00] belshazzar was that when god spoke to
[31:02] you
[31:04] and you saw what had happened previously
[31:06] and you did not go on and follow that
[31:09] then when god tried to deal with you he
[31:11] couldn't deal with you because you were
[31:13] hard your heart was hardened so you
[31:16] would not go so he so that's the reason
[31:18] the handwriting came on the wall and god
[31:20] told
[31:21] come and and you know then he realized
[31:23] that he had no one in his kingdom that
[31:25] could interpret that
[31:27] none of the wise men none of the
[31:29] physicians no none of the anybody could
[31:33] could astrologers whoever it was nobody
[31:35] could interpret that
[31:37] but the scripture tells us that when
[31:38] they went looking for somebody they said
[31:40] oh there's a great man and there's a
[31:42] prophet in our day that has the ability
[31:45] to make these things known
[31:47] that god speaks through and is able to
[31:49] interpret these things and give the
[31:51] truth
[31:52] and he says then who calls daniel to to
[31:55] the place and he says daniel give us the
[31:57] interpretation if you can
[32:01] and you know
[32:02] then he offers daniel all these riches
[32:03] and everything and daniel's like listen
[32:05] he said you keep all of that he said i
[32:06] don't want any of that he said my job is
[32:09] just to declare the word of the lord
[32:11] and that's what he began to tell
[32:13] belshazzari begins to give belshazzar
[32:15] the rebuke that he gave him because it
[32:17] became the time that he began to tell
[32:19] him these things listen this is the
[32:21] condition that you're in
[32:23] you have been weighed in the balance and
[32:25] found wanting
[32:26] why because you've turned down the word
[32:28] for your day
[32:30] you've turned down the word amen
[32:34] and see it's it's a it's a
[32:37] the scripture says you know we also give
[32:39] a
[32:40] a greater heed
[32:43] a more earnest heed to the things that
[32:45] we've heard because you know the thing
[32:46] is is just like when you hear something
[32:49] and you see something
[32:51] where because in our day we don't have
[32:54] an excuse
[32:57] when and and the times passed you know
[32:59] god weaked at people's ignorance
[33:02] he looked back he looked over things
[33:03] that people but you know what when it's
[33:05] been taught and it's been made declared
[33:07] to you
[33:08] then you have then you're then you're
[33:10] the one that has to
[33:12] answer amen
[33:15] what will you do with this jesus christ
[33:20] this is uh from the message beginning
[33:22] and ending of the gentile dispensation
[33:27] now brother broom says now notice then
[33:29] god took king nebuchadnezzar and he made
[33:31] him a tool in his hand
[33:33] when king nebuchadnezzar died
[33:35] after he had the grass had the grass
[33:38] grow out his hair like a lion or eagles
[33:40] feathers and his fingernails like the
[33:42] claws of an eagle and so forth and god
[33:44] had let him know who was the real king
[33:47] after his death belshazzar's grandson
[33:49] succeeded him then he was more wicked
[33:52] than king nebuchadnezzar and one night
[33:55] there they had a great big party they
[33:57] called all the magistrates and all the
[34:00] officers in for a great big jamboree and
[34:02] while they were having this jamboree
[34:04] they went and called out and took the
[34:07] vessels the holy vessels of god just to
[34:09] make fun of god now listen to this
[34:13] and drink wine to their gods a toast out
[34:16] of the vessels of the lord
[34:20] a man is permitted to travel so far but
[34:22] there is a separating line between life
[34:24] and death he must never cross that sea
[34:27] you can go on with your little
[34:29] foolishness for a while but you better
[34:31] know where that line is
[34:34] did the lord ever check you on anything
[34:37] he does it
[34:38] he does all of us pull the check reigns
[34:41] that that's far enough now then you
[34:42] better watch what you're doing from now
[34:44] on if you're stepping across towards
[34:47] that line
[34:48] and that night when god pulled the check
[34:50] reigns on him and he wouldn't listen
[34:52] goes on down brings out the vessels of
[34:54] the lord began to drink wine in them and
[34:56] toast their gods then there came a hand
[34:59] down out of heaven and wrote on the wall
[35:00] many many tickle of sharon meaning thou
[35:03] art weighed in the balance and found
[35:04] warning no one could interpret it it was
[35:06] unknown tongues and there was a man
[35:09] there that had the gift of
[35:10] interpretation daniel so he comes down
[35:12] and interprets and tells the king what
[35:14] would happen and their god destroyed
[35:17] that nation babylon
[35:20] so we see what happened
[35:22] and this is from the message three kinds
[35:25] of believers
[35:26] and so i hope you all don't mind i'm
[35:28] gonna read maybe a couple of quotes here
[35:30] just to lay a foundation again
[35:33] but
[35:34] this is from uh three kinds of believers
[35:36] brother bram says nebuchadnezzar though
[35:37] having daniel as his god
[35:40] called him
[35:42] belter
[35:44] which was the name of his god
[35:47] so we know that
[35:50] two things that come out of this
[35:52] when uh when we look at this
[35:54] you know there's
[35:56] we see that brother brahm talks about
[35:59] the the gentile kingdom gentile
[36:01] dispensation
[36:02] it come in
[36:04] with man worship
[36:07] and unknown tongues
[36:10] and we see that how that came about and
[36:13] it came
[36:14] and it brought destruction
[36:17] it says he called him belgius chapter
[36:19] was the name of his god saw daniel do
[36:21] the great works of god and then he know
[36:23] that beltashas are believed or that
[36:25] daniel was a god so he made an image
[36:27] unto him and put it out there and made
[36:30] everybody worship it and so for see the
[36:32] king the gentile kingdom came in with
[36:34] forcing of the worship of an image of a
[36:36] holy man and the gentile kingdom goes
[36:39] out with the forcing of the image of a
[36:41] holy man see same way and there was a
[36:44] handwriting on the wall of unknown
[36:46] tongues at the beginning of the gentile
[36:48] kingdom
[36:49] that no one could read but that prophet
[36:52] and there is a handwriting on the wall
[36:54] today that's wrote ichabod
[36:57] that the glory of god has departed from
[36:59] them things and the handwriting is on
[37:01] the wall can be read by the spiritual
[37:04] mind that believes in spiritual things
[37:10] has been born of the spirit of god oh
[37:12] bow to shazza goes out
[37:15] and that that's actually supposed to
[37:16] should be belshazzar not built this
[37:18] yazar goes out and gets these vessels of
[37:21] the of the lord to drink wine and then
[37:23] why he was an unbeliever he thought he
[37:26] was a believer but he was an unbeliever
[37:28] see that's it he disbelieved the word
[37:33] so he disbelieved what god told him
[37:38] and he saw those things
[37:40] and knowing
[37:42] you know the the interesting thing when
[37:44] you look at this you know
[37:46] they
[37:47] when when you look at babylon and those
[37:49] you know they were not
[37:52] uh
[37:54] uneducated people
[37:56] they were not uh
[38:00] i mean when you think when you think
[38:02] about
[38:03] babylon babylon was one of the
[38:06] if not the premier
[38:08] nation at the time i mean that was that
[38:10] was the the epicenter of the world
[38:14] so when you look at when you look to see
[38:16] what was going on there you know it
[38:18] wasn't because they knew
[38:21] because they studied they had great men
[38:23] great men of learning so you know the
[38:24] thing the things of the laws of god was
[38:26] not foreign to them
[38:29] especially when they had daniel and the
[38:31] different ones that had been been there
[38:33] and they had lived and they had studied
[38:35] all these things so when it comes to
[38:36] this place it wasn't that they didn't
[38:38] know these things
[38:40] they were they were fully aware of all
[38:42] of these things
[38:45] and seen the power of god
[38:48] but when you see all of these things
[38:49] that were taking place yet they just
[38:52] began to gloss over them
[38:54] and they and they didn't have any
[38:56] reverence to these things
[38:59] even when even when
[39:02] belshazzar saw what took place with
[39:03] nebuchadnezzar and then when they saw
[39:06] all of the things that god had done yet
[39:08] when they went in and took those vessels
[39:12] you know those those things were still
[39:14] um
[39:16] it meant a lot to god and they were
[39:18] still holy
[39:19] wherever they were at
[39:22] you know it's just like it's just like
[39:24] when they when they took the uh ark of
[39:26] the covenant when they took the ark and
[39:29] they and they moved it when they took it
[39:32] and they the philistines had captured
[39:34] and they brought it before
[39:36] dagon then you know what
[39:38] even though they were even though it was
[39:39] in the possession of the enemy
[39:42] the ark of the covenant still was holy
[39:45] and it still was powerful
[39:47] so when it laid before when they put it
[39:49] in there in their in their temple before
[39:51] dagon showing that because the ark of
[39:54] the covenant was was where the god's
[39:57] presence came
[39:59] in the temple
[40:01] that meant that that was where god's uh
[40:03] where the where the priest offered the
[40:06] blood
[40:07] were that where they sprinkled the blood
[40:08] before the mercy seat see that was an
[40:10] important part to the israel's uh the
[40:14] children of israel's worship
[40:16] that was an important part of what they
[40:18] done
[40:19] and then when the philistines took it
[40:21] then they were like hey we're going to
[40:22] put it over here because dagon has
[40:24] overtaken
[40:26] god
[40:27] the children of israel's god
[40:30] but you know what every single time when
[40:32] when they put him in there and as soon
[40:34] as the ark went into the end of that
[40:35] temple went into the presence of their
[40:37] god then god caused that thing to smash
[40:40] that thing was smashed every single time
[40:43] even though it was in the wrong place
[40:45] but they thought well you know because
[40:47] when they but when they rose up in
[40:49] themselves and hey you know what i got
[40:51] something to tell you we're captured
[40:53] we're you know their god's not any it's
[40:55] not powerful well we we know in the
[40:58] scripture they had a hard time
[41:02] god made them very uncomfortable
[41:07] it changed it changed their lives
[41:12] and you know when and it made it made
[41:14] them so it was so painful for them and
[41:17] it made them so uncomfortable that you
[41:18] know god even made them they made golden
[41:21] images of that
[41:25] why because that was always a sign unto
[41:27] them of what god done to them
[41:31] and you know after a while the
[41:32] philistines were ready to move that
[41:34] thing
[41:37] because you know what you can't you
[41:38] can't have a halfway life you can you
[41:42] can't you can't bring in bring the word
[41:44] of god in and have have it a little bit
[41:46] over here and a little bit over there
[41:48] you know because you know what you're
[41:49] going to be getting really uncomfortable
[41:53] you see people that are miserable in
[41:54] their lives why because they want to
[41:56] dabble in the world a little bit over
[41:58] here and they want a little bit of the
[42:00] church over here you know they want to
[42:01] they want to be church christian on on
[42:03] sunday but they want to live to live
[42:05] like the world out on on saturday or any
[42:08] other day of the week you know because
[42:09] you know you can't live like the world
[42:11] and die like paul
[42:13] you can't you can't have both of them
[42:15] you're going to have to you're going to
[42:16] have to either be one or the other
[42:18] because you can't have both of them you
[42:20] can't be
[42:21] you can't serve god and mammon
[42:23] but when they when they come through
[42:24] that then they want to get rid of that
[42:26] ark because that ark was too much
[42:28] problems for them and they had to get
[42:30] rid of that ark of the covenant and even
[42:32] even where when they got rid of it
[42:35] you know the people that that broke and
[42:36] took the ark of the covenant you know
[42:39] wherever that thing went you know they
[42:40] had to be respectful to that thing
[42:42] because god had had respect to that ark
[42:48] when when they brought that when they
[42:49] brought that thing
[42:51] forward
[42:54] just like when when when they when they
[42:56] when they brought it out and they said
[42:57] it in the man's house you know the man
[42:59] was blessed by it that it was that it
[43:01] was in his home that he kept it
[43:05] and you know david had a david had had a
[43:08] great
[43:09] uh
[43:10] revelation
[43:12] one day
[43:15] david had a great revelation that you
[43:17] know hey we we need to get we need to
[43:19] get this ark in front of the people
[43:22] we need to bring this thing up and we
[43:23] need to consult the ark of the covenant
[43:25] we need to why because we've not had it
[43:27] before
[43:28] it's been it's been out of our presence
[43:29] for so long we need to bring it in
[43:33] but you know the problem was
[43:35] david had a great revelation the problem
[43:37] was he didn't follow anything that it
[43:39] should have been done
[43:41] amen the revelation brother adam said
[43:43] the problem with david was he got the
[43:44] revelation and not not nathan
[43:47] nathan's revelation was because he was
[43:49] the prophet david was not
[43:52] and then when he was supposed to bring
[43:53] the ark of the covenant it wasn't
[43:55] supposed to be brought on a cart it
[43:57] wasn't supposed to be brought by oxen
[44:00] the law never changed
[44:03] and what what would happen if he if he
[44:05] would have consulted
[44:07] nathan and not anybody else but he went
[44:09] to nathan david would have got the word
[44:11] of god because nathan would have told
[44:13] him what to do why because it's supposed
[44:15] to be carried on the shoulders of the
[44:16] levites and then it would have came in
[44:19] that way
[44:21] i was looking at what brother chris had
[44:23] to say sunday talking about the oxen
[44:25] stumbled
[44:28] why because none of that was correct
[44:33] there was only one person that should
[44:34] have been consulted and that was the
[44:35] prophet
[44:36] the prophet had the word and then
[44:38] everything else would have been in line
[44:42] but they didn't but they didn't follow
[44:43] it yet and but they had so many people
[44:45] oh yeah this is great david this is
[44:46] great this is great we like it
[44:49] it's all contrary to the word
[44:53] he had he had the right motive and
[44:55] objective but he followed it totally
[44:57] wrong
[45:00] and when it when it came in the and the
[45:01] oxen stumbled then then uh perez or
[45:05] whatever uh believe was his name you
[45:06] know he put his hand forth to catch it
[45:08] why because because he was trying to do
[45:10] something for god
[45:13] david was trying to do something it was
[45:15] out of the will of god but he wanted to
[45:16] do something for god and here parents
[45:18] trying to do the exact same thing and it
[45:20] caused his death
[45:24] and then david said what are we going to
[45:26] do now
[45:28] we got to put everything though we've
[45:29] got to stop everything
[45:31] and he was so upset
[45:33] how are we going to do this
[45:36] and then and then
[45:38] later on in the another chapter i
[45:39] believe the next chapter we find out
[45:41] here's david standing up and say
[45:43] the ark is coming back but the ark is
[45:45] coming on the shoulders of the levites
[45:49] why because he never done it exactly
[45:52] exactly the way that it should have come
[45:55] and if he'd have followed that then it
[45:57] would have wouldn't have been death
[45:59] and it wouldn't have been death it would
[46:00] have been destruction but that's what
[46:01] took place
[46:05] and see that's the same way
[46:08] when we have
[46:09] we have a
[46:11] a thing that takes place when when the
[46:14] word of god has went forth when when we
[46:16] see the the age and the time in which we
[46:18] live when things don't follow that
[46:20] there's only one thing god has
[46:23] whatever takes place god will always use
[46:25] a prophet
[46:27] to make that what make the word known
[46:29] and to let to identify the doubt the
[46:31] time of the day and and the way out and
[46:34] the way things ought to be
[46:36] and so there's so we there's no second
[46:39] guessing
[46:40] there's no there's no confusion why
[46:42] because there's a way made
[46:44] to know these things
[46:52] this is uh
[46:54] from the smyrna church age
[46:57] the church age book
[46:59] brother brahm says
[47:01] he said now you might want to scold me
[47:03] right here for what what i've said he
[47:05] said all right
[47:06] he said they call themselves pentecostal
[47:08] in full full gospel he said let them
[47:11] prove it
[47:12] at pentecost the fire came in a cloud
[47:14] and separated
[47:16] each of them like a tongue
[47:18] over each of them like a tongue and fell
[47:19] on each one
[47:21] he said where is the fire they spoke in
[47:23] tongues at pentecost and the people who
[47:25] listened understood
[47:28] where is that
[47:30] the whole multitude of believers acted
[47:32] like one family pentecostals are as
[47:34] badly divided as any group in history no
[47:37] man just joined himself
[47:40] to the early church but only god added
[47:44] they have as many goats among them as
[47:47] any
[47:48] they claim to be full gospel they prove
[47:50] it
[47:50] their churches are as empty as power as
[47:53] any of them if they are full gospel then
[47:55] we had better admit that bible made a
[47:58] mistake when it describes the full
[47:59] gospel men at pentecost
[48:02] they sing there's been a great change in
[48:04] me
[48:05] but the change has not been for the
[48:06] better
[48:10] i'm thinking about that today there's
[48:12] been a great change in
[48:14] great change in me
[48:17] but if we don't follow the word it only
[48:20] makes you worse
[48:23] it is time to get back to god they have
[48:24] a name
[48:26] that they live but they are dead tongues
[48:28] isn't the evidence of revival
[48:31] it's the evidence of death
[48:35] tongues proclaimed the evidence that a
[48:37] ceremonial religion of the jews was over
[48:40] that a new era had begun tongues today
[48:42] is is ringing down the curtain on the
[48:44] gentile church ages and the gospel is
[48:46] going back to the jews
[48:48] people are talking about tongues
[48:50] heralding in a great spiritual move they
[48:52] have missed the boat
[48:54] the truth is that the handwriting that
[48:57] the writing i'm sorry the truth is that
[48:59] it is writing the finish to all of man's
[49:02] ideas programs and kingdoms and the
[49:04] kingdom of god is being ushered in wake
[49:06] up people of god wake up
[49:09] he said if you don't think this true
[49:10] just listen to this all over the world
[49:12] in both pentecostal and fundamental
[49:15] groups
[49:16] they are organizing the businessmen
[49:19] he said they've invaded the pulpit
[49:20] without a call from god they have styled
[49:22] themselves the fishers of men and the
[49:25] founders of a move of god and they say
[49:28] and they
[49:29] say the gifted ministry of ephesians 4
[49:32] 10 through 13 that god gave the church
[49:34] has failed so they are taking over
[49:37] here we are right in the midst of the
[49:39] fulfillment of prophecy called the gang
[49:42] sayings of korah and they don't even
[49:44] know that they have fulfilled it they
[49:46] are blindly going on preaching
[49:48] experience for truth
[49:51] you know it's so amazing i was listening
[49:53] i don't know if y'all saw that you know
[49:54] creflo dollar just
[49:56] announced the other day he said that uh
[49:59] he said any of my teachings he on on
[50:02] tithing and all of the
[50:04] giving and all that he said throw all
[50:05] those books and those dvds and
[50:07] everything away and then he got up and
[50:09] pro and proceeded to tell everybody that
[50:12] uh tithing is unscriptural
[50:17] here's a man that goes from one one
[50:19] extreme
[50:20] to the other
[50:24] and it's like well you know the problem
[50:25] is is there's got to be a balance
[50:30] because you know do you know because
[50:31] we're we're if you're going to split the
[50:33] the word then where why don't we just
[50:35] throw it all away
[50:38] well you know it you know you know if we
[50:40] get rid of the ti well tithing's not in
[50:42] the in the new testament we don't we
[50:44] don't see any of that and you know we
[50:46] don't
[50:46] i was like you know there is one spot in
[50:48] the in the scripture
[50:50] in the new testament when jesus is
[50:52] watching a widow woman and she throws in
[50:54] all she has
[50:58] i know that's an interesting thing
[51:00] because she only had two arms and she
[51:02] gave that
[51:03] and you know what and jesus marveled at
[51:05] her because she gave all that she had
[51:07] she gave out of her need and not out of
[51:09] her abundance
[51:13] it's like well if we want to look at so
[51:15] the one that
[51:16] if you you know just want to be carnal
[51:18] if we only look at what jesus admired
[51:20] and what jesus proclaimed to the
[51:22] disciples and all that he said give
[51:24] everything so you know what we should
[51:25] own anything
[51:27] because if you go back and look in the
[51:29] book of acts what did they do they took
[51:30] everything that they had and they sold
[51:32] and they added everything together and
[51:34] they had it all to common
[51:37] so that so that had the person that had
[51:39] a lot
[51:41] didn't have it didn't lack anything and
[51:43] the one that didn't have anything didn't
[51:44] like either why because it was all
[51:46] together as a common goal
[51:51] but you know it it's interesting how
[51:54] they you know it's not in the new
[51:55] testament it's not well yeah
[51:58] it's what you want to look at
[52:03] because you know the thing is if we take
[52:04] the scripture then we have to take all
[52:06] the scripture
[52:09] we got to look all the way through the
[52:11] scripture
[52:14] what did what did god require
[52:20] you know because when when you look in
[52:21] the scripture everybody's like well why
[52:22] don't we why why isn't we not still
[52:24] offering sacrifices why because we had a
[52:26] sacrifice
[52:28] we didn't have to have we didn't have to
[52:30] have a lamb why because we had one that
[52:32] fulfilled that
[52:33] they had one that was perfect that came
[52:36] and he and he fulfilled all the law
[52:39] that we don't have to have that
[52:42] because you know what if i'm out there
[52:43] offering lambs and bull locks and turtle
[52:46] doves then you know what i'm counting
[52:48] the blood of christ unworthy
[52:51] because he's the one that i'm that i'm
[52:53] taking and i'm that he's the he's the
[52:55] one that i take as as my sacrifice then
[52:58] i don't have to have a a one that
[53:01] i'm trying to find a perfect lamb
[53:05] because god identified that that he was
[53:07] coming
[53:09] and john identified him so that when we
[53:11] look back we can see the perfect one
[53:13] that died for our sins so i'm still
[53:16] under that blood i'm still claiming that
[53:18] token i'm still claiming that so i'm
[53:21] still under the blood because but you
[53:23] know what it's been fulfilled the old
[53:25] testament part of it has been fulfilled
[53:27] and it's a new and better way that we
[53:29] have because we have we have eternal
[53:31] redemption through this one because
[53:33] blood the blood of bulls and goats never
[53:35] could take away sin it never could take
[53:37] away the conscience of sin never could
[53:39] take away the desire of sin but we have
[53:41] one that can be changed one because the
[53:43] the life that was in that perfect lamb
[53:45] can came back can come back on the
[53:48] believer who so that the the life that
[53:50] was in that perfect lamb which is the
[53:52] life of god can come back on us and that
[53:54] we can be made perfect that we can
[53:56] become the children of god because we
[53:59] are we're just like him
[54:01] the representatives of god
[54:07] because that's that is such a great
[54:09] thing to realize that you know i had
[54:11] there's a way to get past
[54:13] how whatever we come the way we come in
[54:15] this world in sin
[54:17] and all of our shortcomings and all of
[54:19] our problems all of our failures
[54:20] whatever we have there's a way made that
[54:22] i can overcome
[54:25] because you know there is a way made i
[54:27] don't have to live the way that i you
[54:29] know well i i was just born this way i
[54:32] was just born this way you know i was
[54:33] born this way but you know what there is
[54:35] a perfect lamb there's there's a
[54:36] sacrifice there's a fountain open in the
[54:38] house of david for sin and uncleanness
[54:41] that will come and clean you clean you
[54:43] and turn you into a child of god
[54:47] i don't have to live that way
[54:51] the problem is is when we walk out there
[54:53] and we we just claim that hey i just i'm
[54:55] just born this way i was just born this
[54:57] way well guess what that's the reason
[54:59] that jesus said ye must be born again
[55:02] why because there's a way made to con to
[55:04] do away with all this thing to do away
[55:06] with your first birth
[55:09] but the problem is is when we want to
[55:11] stand up and we want to wave our flags
[55:13] and we want to get up and and proclaim
[55:16] the pride
[55:21] i tell you when when you see that it's
[55:23] it's filthy
[55:26] but you know it's it's the same way you
[55:28] know it it's it's really interesting i
[55:30] always i always find it kind of
[55:32] kind of comical we got people that you
[55:34] know that's like you know that is so
[55:36] that is such a horrible thing and that's
[55:38] an abomination
[55:41] and i was like
[55:43] do you know
[55:44] that fornication is too
[55:50] i was and then you know because people
[55:52] say well you know you know
[55:54] you know
[55:55] heterosexual straight people and it's
[55:57] like listen i wouldn't stand up
[56:00] and proclaim against somebody else if i
[56:02] was out doing the exact same thing
[56:07] and it's like well you know listen
[56:08] fornication and adultery is an
[56:10] abomination before god just like just
[56:12] like
[56:13] sodomy
[56:15] living living a homosexual lifestyle
[56:17] that's against the word of god well
[56:19] guess what all the other things are too
[56:23] there ain't no big sins and ain't no
[56:25] little sense but you know if you if you
[56:26] if you think it's okay to be one way
[56:29] then don't don't go around trying to
[56:31] point fingers and and run everybody else
[56:33] down
[56:37] just like just like you hear people and
[56:41] hear people talking
[56:42] and jesus said he said that if if you
[56:46] run down your brother if you try to kill
[56:48] a brother's
[56:49] influence
[56:51] and you know this and this is this is
[56:53] for people out in the world too
[56:57] if you if you go out and stab somebody
[56:59] in the back
[57:01] are you somebody you say you're
[57:02] somebody's friend and you treat somebody
[57:04] like that
[57:07] the way people treat each other and and
[57:09] that's it you know like they say keep
[57:11] your friends close and your enemies
[57:13] closer
[57:15] and you do people like that it's like
[57:16] you know that's just like murdering
[57:18] somebody
[57:20] jesus said that
[57:23] jesus said if you were to look upon a
[57:24] woman
[57:25] to lust after you've already committed
[57:27] adultery
[57:30] you don't even have to do a physical act
[57:32] all you gotta do is sit and watch them
[57:35] but if you'll do that then you know what
[57:37] you can't get out and proclaim against
[57:39] somebody else
[57:45] it's like well you know that's just
[57:46] actually he's like yeah that's the way
[57:48] you were born
[57:51] you know the same same sin that you you
[57:54] preach against somebody else yeah that's
[57:55] the way they were born the same way you
[57:57] were born you were born under sin
[58:00] you were born with a fall of nature
[58:03] and you come you can come to a church
[58:05] and you and you shake you shake the
[58:07] preacher's hand and you can get baptized
[58:11] and you can read the bible
[58:16] just like just like they said you know
[58:22] you know they got you know they get
[58:25] they say they got jesus in their heart
[58:26] well you know what jesus don't act like
[58:28] it
[58:35] but you know that you
[58:39] god calls us to live a life of holiness
[58:44] and you know when you when you look at
[58:45] this and it's like when you get to the
[58:46] place where well i don't know about that
[58:49] well i don't i don't know about that
[58:51] well that's the problem
[58:56] when you when the when the spirit
[58:59] of god comes in
[59:01] jesus said how be it when he the spirit
[59:03] of truth has come he said he'll lead you
[59:05] and guide you into all truth
[59:09] then if he's the spirit of truth then
[59:11] when the scripture says
[59:13] and you know you know he don't and
[59:15] whether you believe it or not god didn't
[59:17] make a contradiction in the word
[59:19] he didn't make a mistake when he wrote
[59:20] the word
[59:24] so what so when he begins to tie when he
[59:26] begins to talk about these things it's
[59:28] like well exactly where are we going to
[59:29] put these things
[59:33] the way the way men dress the way women
[59:35] dress the way people act
[59:39] whether whether whether you believe it
[59:40] or not it's still the same it didn't
[59:42] change
[59:43] god didn't stutter anywhere in the word
[59:48] whatever said whatever he says in black
[59:50] and white it's the truth
[59:52] and you can try to as as people have
[59:54] tried to do today they've tried to take
[59:56] and tried to find different
[59:58] interpretations and translations and
[1:00:00] they've tried to go back and well you
[1:00:02] got to study more of the greek or
[1:00:03] whatever you know what you need is is to
[1:00:05] realize that god wrote the scripture and
[1:00:07] he's the only one that's going to
[1:00:09] interpret the word
[1:00:11] but when he tells how he's going to do
[1:00:13] it then he always done it the same way
[1:00:17] there's only one way that god ever
[1:00:18] interpreted his word was he spoke it
[1:00:20] through the mouth of a prophet and the
[1:00:22] word was the prophets came and
[1:00:24] interpreted exactly what the prophet
[1:00:25] said
[1:00:28] there's only one way that's going to
[1:00:30] take place god doesn't need doesn't need
[1:00:32] a group of people to figure this thing
[1:00:34] out god doesn't need a council to figure
[1:00:36] this thing out he doesn't he doesn't
[1:00:37] need intelligent people all he needs is
[1:00:39] people that are sold out to the point to
[1:00:42] believe that god is the one in control
[1:00:44] and he can move and speak
[1:00:46] he's still moving today still speaking
[1:00:48] today and whatever we have need of he'll
[1:00:50] speak to us
[1:00:53] it didn't change what god said in his
[1:00:55] word
[1:00:58] he's still the same yesterday today and
[1:01:00] forever
[1:01:07] brother brown says continuing on here in
[1:01:08] the smyrna church age he says when did
[1:01:10] prestige and money and social leadership
[1:01:13] and tur business ability or sheer mental
[1:01:15] prowess ever qualify a man for spiritual
[1:01:17] leadership or give any weight to the
[1:01:19] word of god
[1:01:22] when in any way materially
[1:01:24] or human values begin to show as the
[1:01:27] media by which god works instead of the
[1:01:29] holy spirit alone
[1:01:32] then we are fighting against god not for
[1:01:35] him
[1:01:38] he begins he says you know speaking
[1:01:40] against elders
[1:01:44] i was joking with this this black man
[1:01:46] he's a he's a real good friend of ours
[1:01:49] he's a
[1:01:50] he's a deacon in a baptist church and i
[1:01:52] always kill him he always tells
[1:01:53] everybody
[1:01:54] that uh he said he always tells me he
[1:01:57] said tells everybody about me he says
[1:01:59] now you got to watch aaron he said
[1:02:01] he got a lot of money he just used he's
[1:02:02] just using tag for a decoy
[1:02:06] yeah yeah yeah mr eddie i'm just here
[1:02:08] cause i want to
[1:02:11] you know
[1:02:12] but i told him he's a deacon in church i
[1:02:13] said when was the last time you seen a
[1:02:15] poor deacon
[1:02:19] when you look at when you go to the
[1:02:20] baptist church tell me where a poor
[1:02:21] deacon's at
[1:02:24] last time i looked as scarce as hen's
[1:02:26] teeth that's what i always tell him but
[1:02:28] that's why i get back at him but
[1:02:30] what you know brother ham said he says
[1:02:32] that an elder can be as poor or rich as
[1:02:34] anybody else
[1:02:36] he said he said
[1:02:37] it's what what's in his heart
[1:02:40] and that elder can be as poor as any man
[1:02:42] was ever poor or be the richest man in
[1:02:44] the world as long as he is elder in
[1:02:46] heart indeed
[1:02:49] he said i would not hesitate to ordain a
[1:02:51] man that has the real spiritual
[1:02:53] qualifications as an elder or deacon
[1:02:55] regardless of his finances or social
[1:02:57] position
[1:03:00] he continues on here
[1:03:08] but when you see a social or financial
[1:03:10] structure come into the church divides
[1:03:12] the folks in any way that is not of god
[1:03:14] it is another sign of the time in this
[1:03:16] physically rich but spiritually
[1:03:18] impoverished laodicean age in which we
[1:03:21] are now living
[1:03:23] because it's all about who's got money
[1:03:27] and you see that it's it's like well you
[1:03:28] know we want we want the people that's
[1:03:31] got money
[1:03:33] and we're gonna we're gonna lean to them
[1:03:35] and cater to them
[1:03:38] well it doesn't really matter who's rich
[1:03:40] or who's poor it's
[1:03:42] whatever the leadership of the holy
[1:03:44] ghost is and and if you're not happy
[1:03:46] with it then
[1:03:47] it's time to go
[1:03:51] you know there's two things you can do
[1:03:52] you can either get an altar and get
[1:03:53] through and pray through to god and get
[1:03:55] right with god or leave
[1:03:57] it can't but you know you can't argue
[1:03:59] with people it's it's got to be the to
[1:04:02] see that the leadership god the holy
[1:04:04] spirit has called leadership in the
[1:04:06] church and they're the ones in charge
[1:04:09] i hear people all the time you know they
[1:04:14] i shouldn't say all the time but i've
[1:04:16] heard it plenty of times that you know
[1:04:17] people they'll stand around and it's
[1:04:19] like
[1:04:20] but why do they do that
[1:04:22] and why did they do that
[1:04:24] and why did they say that
[1:04:28] well you know what brother i'm i'm gonna
[1:04:34] but you know what
[1:04:36] i get tired and i tell you one thing
[1:04:39] before you open your mouth
[1:04:44] you need to pray
[1:04:49] because you know that's a that's a
[1:04:50] problem that people have is because they
[1:04:52] all sit around and you know what you're
[1:04:53] sowing seeds in people's minds
[1:04:58] you know i've heard i've heard young
[1:04:59] people
[1:05:00] that have heard just like
[1:05:03] elisha
[1:05:06] those children heard their mom and
[1:05:08] daddies
[1:05:09] running down the prophet
[1:05:12] and it caused their death
[1:05:17] and you know what i've heard people that
[1:05:19] come back young people
[1:05:21] and some of them have grown up but you
[1:05:23] know what that's that you know that's
[1:05:24] like well who you supposed to trust
[1:05:28] because you know what they heard all
[1:05:30] kinds they heard they got a belly full
[1:05:32] of stuff growing up as children
[1:05:35] their parents were unhappy
[1:05:39] and all they they went to church they
[1:05:41] went and sent a message pew and all they
[1:05:43] could do was is run people down or argue
[1:05:46] or question everything and you know
[1:05:47] that's that's so sees in children's
[1:05:49] minds and when they grow up you know
[1:05:50] what they got no use for it
[1:05:55] so what do we need to do we need to keep
[1:05:57] our mouth closed
[1:05:59] we need to make sure that our speech is
[1:06:01] always
[1:06:03] controlled by the holy ghost
[1:06:06] our words need to be
[1:06:08] and you know and i i don't know i
[1:06:10] understand you know i'm not i'm not
[1:06:11] saying i'm perfect or all right that i
[1:06:13] got this under i got a handle on this
[1:06:15] because i don't
[1:06:16] because you know what we still we still
[1:06:18] live in this realm and we still have to
[1:06:21] get get uh forgiveness for things that
[1:06:24] we say
[1:06:25] and sometimes we pop off
[1:06:30] but you know there's one thing there's
[1:06:31] one thing about it
[1:06:32] i i i still this is this is still my
[1:06:35] church
[1:06:36] and like i said last time whoever the
[1:06:38] pastor you know until god tells me to
[1:06:40] leave i'm here
[1:06:42] and i got my shoulders to the wheel i
[1:06:44] got my shoulder to i'm still pressing on
[1:06:47] and whether whether you whether you go
[1:06:50] or you stay god bless you you do
[1:06:52] whatever but i'm still here i'm still
[1:06:54] pressing this battle i'm still going to
[1:06:56] support everything that takes place
[1:06:58] whether i agree with it or not but you
[1:07:00] know what it ain't my it ain't my place
[1:07:02] to do it unless i see something in the
[1:07:04] word that's contrary
[1:07:06] that it's not my place the only thing my
[1:07:08] the only thing i know the the prophet
[1:07:10] told me that i was supposed to pray
[1:07:14] are you supposed to pray for the pastor
[1:07:17] we're supposed to we're supposed to pray
[1:07:19] for the for the ministers we're supposed
[1:07:21] to pray for the leadership in the church
[1:07:24] so i'm not i'm not
[1:07:27] i'm not going
[1:07:29] you know but i i will i will say this
[1:07:32] much
[1:07:33] i will say this much praise the lord
[1:07:36] going to anyway
[1:07:37] but you know what it's it's a good idea
[1:07:40] and i i pray that maybe one of these
[1:07:42] days
[1:07:43] it'll work out for me then when somebody
[1:07:46] starts to talk anything it's just time
[1:07:47] to do a 180 and start
[1:07:49] making tracks
[1:07:53] if anybody wants to get on the phone and
[1:07:55] you ain't got nothing good to talk about
[1:07:59] bye
[1:08:02] exactly
[1:08:05] let's get rid of it
[1:08:07] cut it off
[1:08:10] because if it's not if it's not
[1:08:12] edifying
[1:08:14] if it's not if it's not that's going to
[1:08:16] help anybody we just need to get rid of
[1:08:18] it it's not going to help anybody
[1:08:21] if we spent more time talking to god
[1:08:23] about issues and problems than talking
[1:08:25] to each other we'd have we'd have a much
[1:08:27] better church
[1:08:29] and i'm talking about this church i'm
[1:08:31] talking about every church
[1:08:34] i
[1:08:35] but you know i'm
[1:08:38] i i i have such a desire to to get
[1:08:42] through because i i want everybody
[1:08:46] to us to see what god has given us and
[1:08:48] what god wants us to do
[1:08:51] if god has called us to this place then
[1:08:53] we need to see who we are
[1:08:55] and what god has for us to do
[1:09:00] because
[1:09:01] as as we see here in the scripture
[1:09:04] and i'm i'm probably not going to get
[1:09:06] done tonight but that's all right i'm
[1:09:08] going to get as far as i can but when we
[1:09:10] see the scripture what what took place
[1:09:12] in the past what what has happened
[1:09:14] and when all these things were given to
[1:09:16] us as examples then what then we ought
[1:09:18] to give a more earnest heed to these
[1:09:19] things that we've seen to understand
[1:09:22] these things have happened for a reason
[1:09:26] and we we see all these things that
[1:09:27] happen when when the word has come forth
[1:09:30] and people have turned the word down and
[1:09:32] they have just
[1:09:34] not given
[1:09:36] the uh honest heed to the word
[1:09:39] and if you've not and they've not done
[1:09:41] that if they've not received the word
[1:09:43] for their day they've not seen the word
[1:09:46] then then it's time to come to a place
[1:09:48] and realize that
[1:09:50] it's a late hour
[1:09:52] it's a it's a late hour that you we
[1:09:54] don't know how much longer we've got
[1:10:03] this is from the god of this evil age
[1:10:05] i'm going to try to hurry through this
[1:10:08] and brother i'm speaking he says notice
[1:10:09] how beautiful
[1:10:11] this is number six brothers he said
[1:10:12] notice how beautiful the scripture ties
[1:10:14] themselves together in every age notice
[1:10:16] now when the church world would not have
[1:10:19] the word of god to rule over them
[1:10:22] he said they accepted a murder barabbas
[1:10:24] what did this do it exalted satan
[1:10:28] the god of this evil age to a place that
[1:10:30] he's always wanted
[1:10:32] now listen for satan to not
[1:10:35] is for satan is not spoken as a god of
[1:10:38] any other age but this age
[1:10:40] he wasn't spoke of god of the god of mo
[1:10:43] the age of moses the god of the age of
[1:10:45] elijah the
[1:10:47] but the evil age this evil age he is
[1:10:49] don't miss it he is the god of this evil
[1:10:51] age worshiped by millions and billions
[1:10:53] of people and they don't know it
[1:10:55] but let's let's let the scripture
[1:10:57] uncover this morning and let's see
[1:11:00] you'll see
[1:11:02] then you'll know
[1:11:04] that he's been the god
[1:11:05] of this evil age
[1:11:08] and so
[1:11:09] as we and people don't even realize who
[1:11:11] they're worshiping
[1:11:13] millions and billions of people are
[1:11:15] worshiping
[1:11:16] why because they've had a false religion
[1:11:19] they've had a false word given to them
[1:11:21] and they believe it
[1:11:27] and this is from
[1:11:32] what shall we do with this jesus
[1:11:34] this jesus called christ
[1:11:37] he says now look upon the the trial here
[1:11:41] and he's he's speaking about good friday
[1:11:42] and the trial that they brought jesus to
[1:11:45] when when they arrested him
[1:11:48] and he says and the very same thing that
[1:11:50] we're talking about that happened on
[1:11:52] that good friday is is right under our
[1:11:54] noses today and our elders are doing the
[1:11:57] same thing they did
[1:11:58] taking it right in on a similar trial
[1:12:00] after a similar promised word of this
[1:12:03] day has been a vindicated just the same
[1:12:05] as it was vindicated there jesus a
[1:12:08] common carpenter's voice so thought he
[1:12:10] was the word of god made manifest and he
[1:12:13] was thoroughly identified because the
[1:12:15] works of god had manifested himself
[1:12:17] through him and proved that he was the
[1:12:19] messiah
[1:12:20] and he said he said and today that
[1:12:22] similar case has come again when the
[1:12:24] holy spirit has come upon us in the last
[1:12:27] day and identified himself right in our
[1:12:29] church and has proven the same works
[1:12:32] that he did when he was here in the
[1:12:34] fullness upon jesus christ he did the
[1:12:36] same thing upon the bride doing the same
[1:12:38] thing and still we want to get rid of it
[1:12:42] when he's identifying himself what's the
[1:12:44] truth and showing the same thing that
[1:12:46] took place in jesus day is the same
[1:12:48] thing that's happened today and people
[1:12:50] turn it down
[1:12:52] when they don't give an earnest heat to
[1:12:54] when they don't really pay attention to
[1:12:56] it
[1:12:58] then they miss who who christ is
[1:13:03] continuing on here he says when the
[1:13:04] apostles were preaching the gospel and
[1:13:06] come down through irenaeus and many of
[1:13:08] the great reformers and founders back in
[1:13:09] the in the early age and it came to
[1:13:12] nicea one one time for a showdown and
[1:13:14] they decided to make a universal church
[1:13:16] to force people to come under their
[1:13:18] jurisdiction many who
[1:13:21] has read the history here notice how
[1:13:22] many old prophets came there with animal
[1:13:25] skin wrapped around them eating only
[1:13:26] herbs and things and they tried to hold
[1:13:28] out for that word hold for the word of
[1:13:31] god but what did they do
[1:13:33] that 15 days of bloody politics they
[1:13:36] finally decided to make a universal
[1:13:37] church and they graphed some paganism
[1:13:39] with christianity and set it out as a
[1:13:41] universal church
[1:13:43] and he said and today the protestants
[1:13:44] are throwing themselves together in the
[1:13:46] ecumenical council doing the same thing
[1:13:48] grafting in tradition of man instead of
[1:13:50] taking the word of god which is
[1:13:52] thoroughly identified by the holy ghost
[1:13:54] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:13:55] forever the church stands in the balance
[1:13:58] today and is found warning you're back
[1:14:00] in pilate's judgment hall yes sir
[1:14:03] what does he do it's making an image
[1:14:06] unto the beast it's a satellite under
[1:14:08] rome when the ecumenical council is
[1:14:10] forcing will force every protestant
[1:14:12] denomination into it it is practically
[1:14:14] all their now full gospel and all the
[1:14:16] hour is going to come when they
[1:14:20] when they'll have to come or stay out
[1:14:24] and at that time when the force come
[1:14:26] they'll all ready you've already
[1:14:28] identified yourself with the mark of
[1:14:30] beast
[1:14:30] now that's exactly
[1:14:38] and continuing on drop down he says but
[1:14:41] we bring christ again to that great
[1:14:43] crucial hour that he stood in in
[1:14:45] pilate's judgment
[1:14:47] hall pathetically a little bunch pushing
[1:14:51] off to one side with a bowed head other
[1:14:53] denominations rejected him refused him
[1:14:55] refused them and turned them away and
[1:14:57] said have nothing to do with it you
[1:14:59] better check up on the word when now we
[1:15:01] find out this ecumenical council is what
[1:15:04] is it
[1:15:05] what it what's it doing see it
[1:15:09] the bible you say does the bible say
[1:15:12] does the bible say about that yes having
[1:15:14] a form of godliness but denying the
[1:15:16] power thereof blind naked churchgoers
[1:15:19] having a form of godliness but denying
[1:15:21] the power of the holy ghost which
[1:15:22] identifies jesus christ to his word how
[1:15:25] can a man claim to have the holy spirit
[1:15:27] and die the very word which is the holy
[1:15:29] spirit how can a man do that his own
[1:15:32] testimony gives witness that he is not
[1:15:35] what he is supposed to be committing
[1:15:37] spiritual fornication denying the power
[1:15:40] of god paul said in second timothy third
[1:15:42] chapter that's what it'll be said
[1:15:44] be heady and high-minded
[1:15:48] so we know that they have turned the
[1:15:50] word down and
[1:15:51] when the word is made made manifest then
[1:15:54] they deny it
[1:15:56] and it's the same as it was back then
[1:15:58] the word is still come and everybody
[1:15:59] says well that's just the nominations no
[1:16:01] that's this message
[1:16:05] see that's the reason you got to check
[1:16:06] up every day because there's many people
[1:16:09] that you know they just go to church and
[1:16:10] they just listen
[1:16:12] but you know what they've not they've
[1:16:13] not come to a complete sellout they've
[1:16:16] not come to a place where they realize
[1:16:18] who they are
[1:16:21] you know one of these days brother bram
[1:16:22] said you know they're going to wake up
[1:16:23] and realize it's all over with and
[1:16:25] they're not in
[1:16:27] they're not they're not sealed in
[1:16:30] they're just going to be standing around
[1:16:32] looking they're not going to be sealed
[1:16:33] in
[1:16:34] and it's going to be a sad day
[1:16:38] but we see
[1:16:40] that as as we see how the condition that
[1:16:43] the the the world has ended all the the
[1:16:45] things that have
[1:16:46] that has happened
[1:16:49] but you know god said that and all the
[1:16:51] things that took place
[1:16:53] in in the uh
[1:16:56] god of this evil age and satan's eating
[1:16:58] the different messages we've seen the
[1:16:59] condition that the world is in and satan
[1:17:01] had his
[1:17:02] rule
[1:17:03] and his reign and and all the things
[1:17:05] that he's done but you know what god
[1:17:06] promised in the last days that there
[1:17:08] would be a restoration
[1:17:11] and as we go through
[1:17:13] and i'm not i'm not going to read all of
[1:17:15] it but you know brother brown speaking
[1:17:16] of the restoration of the bride tree and
[1:17:18] he and and joel and it says here
[1:17:21] i i do want to read joel chapter one it
[1:17:24] says in the word of the lord that came
[1:17:25] to joel the son of a fuel he said hear
[1:17:28] this ye old man and give here all you
[1:17:30] inhabitants of the land hath this been
[1:17:32] in your days or even in the days of your
[1:17:34] fathers
[1:17:35] he said tell your children of it and and
[1:17:38] your children their children and their
[1:17:40] children another generation
[1:17:44] i thought that was good because you know
[1:17:45] here's nebuchadnezzar and his
[1:17:48] grandson belshazzar is the one that the
[1:17:51] end came to
[1:17:53] but here's here's joel speaking he said
[1:17:55] tell your children and your children and
[1:17:57] the children the third generation
[1:18:00] he said that which the palmer worth have
[1:18:02] left has to
[1:18:04] locus eaten and that which the locust
[1:18:06] has eaten
[1:18:07] left the locust left then the cankle
[1:18:09] worm has eaten
[1:18:11] and that which the cankerworm hath left
[1:18:13] at the caterpillar eat
[1:18:16] but joel 2 says but i will restore unto
[1:18:18] you the years that the locusts have
[1:18:19] eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar
[1:18:21] and the palmer worm my great army which
[1:18:23] i sent among you and you shall eat in
[1:18:26] plenty now listen to this
[1:18:28] all of the destruction that took place
[1:18:30] but here's here's this promise but you
[1:18:32] shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and
[1:18:34] praise the name of the lord your god
[1:18:36] that he hath dealt wondrously with you
[1:18:38] and my people shall never be ashamed and
[1:18:40] ye shall know that i am in the midst of
[1:18:42] israel that i am the lord your god and
[1:18:45] none else and my people shall never be
[1:18:47] ashamed
[1:18:50] and brother brown we begin to speak in
[1:18:52] the in the mess the restoration of the
[1:18:54] bride tree and he begins to talk about
[1:18:55] how each one of those the palmer worm he
[1:18:58] ate the uh
[1:18:59] he ate the fruits and then you know each
[1:19:02] one of them came through the locusts ate
[1:19:03] the ate the i believe the leaves and
[1:19:05] brother brown tells about you know
[1:19:08] because they said the locusts ate the
[1:19:09] leaves which was the fella divine
[1:19:11] fellowship
[1:19:13] and he began to talk about how how the
[1:19:15] cankerworm
[1:19:17] he said he ate the bark
[1:19:19] brother brown says one place he talks
[1:19:21] about the cankerworm eating the doctrine
[1:19:24] he got rid of the doctrine
[1:19:27] because when he ate the doctrine he said
[1:19:29] then he ate he got into the tree by
[1:19:31] eating the bark he said which was the
[1:19:33] doctrine he said when you do away with a
[1:19:34] doctrine then the holy spirit wasn't
[1:19:36] able to move
[1:19:37] he said then he said then when the
[1:19:39] caterpillar came he went into the tree
[1:19:41] and he took the life and he said he ate
[1:19:43] it down to the stump
[1:19:45] he ate all the tree everything was ate
[1:19:47] away but then he said but but but the
[1:19:49] prophecy was he said when all of this
[1:19:51] takes place he said but i'm going to
[1:19:52] restore
[1:19:54] he said i'm going to restore all those
[1:19:56] years all of the things that have been
[1:19:58] taken away he said it's going to come
[1:19:59] back and he said all of that's coming
[1:20:01] back he said all the years that each one
[1:20:03] of them has eaten each one of them's
[1:20:04] coming back and so what is that it's a
[1:20:06] prophecy for our day
[1:20:08] because this is the day that all of the
[1:20:10] fullness is going to come so all so what
[1:20:13] does that happen he said the bark so the
[1:20:15] holy spirit began to move the word came
[1:20:17] back there was a restoration of the word
[1:20:20] and then we see that the restoration
[1:20:21] brought the gifts
[1:20:23] and it brought divine fellowship and it
[1:20:26] brought the fruits of the spirit
[1:20:28] so we see the day that
[1:20:30] and
[1:20:31] in the past when all those things took
[1:20:32] place then what took place in the
[1:20:34] beginning of the day of pentecost is the
[1:20:36] same thing that takes place today
[1:20:40] and we see that it was it was a prophecy
[1:20:42] that was going to take place to see and
[1:20:45] when we when we begin to look at at this
[1:20:47] here ephesians
[1:20:49] 1
[1:20:50] chapter 4 i want to read this and it
[1:20:52] says and he gave some apostles and some
[1:20:55] prophets and some evangelists and some
[1:20:57] pastors and teachers for the perfecting
[1:20:59] of the saints for the work of the
[1:21:00] ministry for the edifying of the body of
[1:21:03] christ he said till we all come to the
[1:21:05] unity of faith and the knowledge of the
[1:21:07] son of god unto a perfect man
[1:21:10] unto the measure
[1:21:12] of the fathers unto the measure of the
[1:21:15] stature of the fullness of christ
[1:21:17] because that was the fullness that the
[1:21:19] pentecostal fathers had
[1:21:28] that we henceforth be no more children
[1:21:30] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[1:21:31] every wind of doctrine by the sight of
[1:21:33] men and and cracked us whereby they
[1:21:35] lie in wait to deceive by speaking truth
[1:21:38] and love may grow up in him and all
[1:21:41] things which is the head even christ
[1:21:43] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[1:21:45] together and compacted by that which
[1:21:48] every joint supplyeth according to the
[1:21:50] effectual working in the measure of
[1:21:52] every part making increase of the unto
[1:21:56] the edifying of itself in love
[1:22:00] and so we know that
[1:22:02] when it began to speak that this was
[1:22:04] going to take place then we know that
[1:22:07] that's what malachi 4 come to do
[1:22:10] we received a promise
[1:22:13] that it would take place that all of the
[1:22:14] restoration had to come within you know
[1:22:18] we see that martin luther done his part
[1:22:20] but that was that was a partial
[1:22:22] restoration
[1:22:25] because it was they were reformers they
[1:22:27] weren't they weren't full restoration
[1:22:29] but it was a coming back of the tree
[1:22:32] so there was only there was only so much
[1:22:34] that that luther was able to do but that
[1:22:36] was truth and then wesley was able to
[1:22:39] pick that up and continue on but there
[1:22:41] had to be one that come to bring us back
[1:22:43] to the fullness of the pentecostal
[1:22:45] fathers
[1:22:47] and when you when you look at this you
[1:22:48] know
[1:22:49] it's so amazing because you see people
[1:22:51] and they and they read these scriptures
[1:22:53] and it's just like you know we just we
[1:22:55] just pull things out of the air no
[1:22:59] no but but when you take the scripture
[1:23:01] and you take the scripture and you look
[1:23:03] here at malachi 4 and when it's when you
[1:23:05] speak of what it what it tells you he
[1:23:07] said behold i send you elijah the
[1:23:09] prophet before the coming of the great
[1:23:10] and dreadful day of the lord and brother
[1:23:12] branham they ask i believe they ask him
[1:23:14] one time in questions and answers and
[1:23:15] they ask him about that he's like listen
[1:23:17] that's not the same person
[1:23:21] because he said john can only a fulfill
[1:23:24] part of that
[1:23:26] and then somebody says well where's that
[1:23:28] in the scripture luke 4.
[1:23:30] and you take somebody to look for and
[1:23:31] you show them and here it is it's
[1:23:33] perfect
[1:23:35] but there's something because like pop
[1:23:37] said one time he said if you if you just
[1:23:39] go if you go to the if the fathers go to
[1:23:40] the children and the children go right
[1:23:42] back then you just went right back to
[1:23:43] where you started
[1:23:45] you're not any further along
[1:23:49] but see that's what that's what john
[1:23:51] come to do he come to turn
[1:23:53] the fathers to the children to see that
[1:23:55] there was a changing of dispensation of
[1:23:57] what was taking place
[1:24:00] and when you see all that our day is the
[1:24:02] day of restoration it's a fullness that
[1:24:05] we're going back to what they had
[1:24:08] that god could show us these things that
[1:24:11] we're going back to that
[1:24:13] people say oh i wish i lived in the day
[1:24:16] of
[1:24:16] peter and john and paul you're living
[1:24:19] the same day of the same word
[1:24:23] it's the same it's the same god working
[1:24:25] today it's like oh i wish i was in the
[1:24:27] day of the apostles
[1:24:28] it is the this is the day
[1:24:32] why because it's the same word luther
[1:24:34] didn't have that word wesley didn't have
[1:24:36] that word pentecost didn't have that
[1:24:38] word but you know what we've got that
[1:24:40] word
[1:24:42] when when you go back and you know how
[1:24:44] many people understood the statue of a
[1:24:46] perfect man to add to your faith
[1:24:51] with all diligence
[1:24:55] when you say all diligence well you know
[1:24:57] and then then it's a sell out it's a
[1:24:59] time that you give every every heed
[1:25:02] everything to do that
[1:25:07] to pro to
[1:25:08] take a take a full measure of everything
[1:25:10] to look to where you need to be
[1:25:14] to
[1:25:15] and then if we see where we need to be
[1:25:17] then if we allow god to come on the
[1:25:19] scene to speak to us then we know how
[1:25:21] where we are and what we need to do
[1:25:24] and how to move forward then to add to
[1:25:26] your faith
[1:25:28] because it takes god to do that but you
[1:25:30] know when god shows you then you take a
[1:25:32] step
[1:25:34] then god's leading you then you're
[1:25:35] adding by the word then you're adding
[1:25:39] virtue to your faith
[1:25:41] and knowledge
[1:25:43] but it's god doing the work it's god
[1:25:45] leading you
[1:25:48] because it's god drawing you
[1:25:51] and the only one and the only one that's
[1:25:52] holding us back the only one that's
[1:25:54] hindering us is us
[1:25:57] then we're we hinder ourselves
[1:26:02] but see he gave us this promise
[1:26:05] the mount the messenger of malachi 4
[1:26:08] and revelation 10 7 is to do two things
[1:26:11] he said one according to malachi 4 would
[1:26:14] turn the hearts of the children of the
[1:26:15] fathers two he will reveal the mysteries
[1:26:17] of the seven thunders in revelation 7
[1:26:20] which are the revelations contained in
[1:26:22] the seven seals it will be these
[1:26:24] divinely revealed mystery truths that
[1:26:26] literally turn the hearts of the
[1:26:28] children to the pentecostal fathers
[1:26:30] exactly so
[1:26:33] so
[1:26:34] i want to
[1:26:35] here is uh this is from harvest time i
[1:26:37] want to read this right quick he says
[1:26:39] now doesn't malachi 4 teach us
[1:26:42] that before the great and terrible day
[1:26:43] of the lord shall come that this will
[1:26:45] take place how many knows that he will
[1:26:47] restore the hearts of the children to
[1:26:49] the fathers is that right the faith of
[1:26:51] the original pentecostal fathers and in
[1:26:53] that day luke 17 20 i believe it is 1730
[1:26:57] i believe i believe it is jesus said
[1:27:01] when the son of man is being revealed
[1:27:02] not man
[1:27:04] the son of man not an organization the
[1:27:06] son of man the word living itself again
[1:27:09] among the people see
[1:27:11] the word itself made flesh in you you're
[1:27:14] a reflection of this hour the message
[1:27:16] reflection of it see you live again the
[1:27:19] life
[1:27:20] live the life that was in jesus christ
[1:27:23] you're in the presence of the son
[1:27:27] then to the what happens to it what
[1:27:29] happens to that church finally listen
[1:27:31] that shuck pulls away
[1:27:33] [Music]
[1:27:35] from that wheat when it begins to be
[1:27:37] manifested what happened the life that
[1:27:39] was in the shuck
[1:27:41] went on into the wheat
[1:27:44] the life won't change the carriers
[1:27:46] change they denominate see the blades
[1:27:48] the tassel the shuck but the weak can't
[1:27:50] change it's got to be a ministry just
[1:27:53] exactly on the word like he was on the
[1:27:55] word like the first church was on the
[1:27:58] word spirit filled word fed not
[1:28:00] denominational fit word faith
[1:28:05] so that's what has been given in our we
[1:28:08] we have this
[1:28:10] the word has been given for us this is
[1:28:13] our day to be a reflection of this to be
[1:28:15] a manifestation of the word for our day
[1:28:19] god has brought this to us that we can
[1:28:21] see these things
[1:28:24] to realize what god is doing in our in
[1:28:26] our hour to lay in the presence of the
[1:28:28] sun
[1:28:32] this is from
[1:28:33] spiritual food and due season and
[1:28:35] brother brown says he said no
[1:28:37] but now god has promised us these things
[1:28:40] in the last days in malachi 4 said that
[1:28:42] said that jesus christ would come down
[1:28:44] and impersonate himself in human flesh
[1:28:46] like he did at sodom that's right and
[1:28:48] said the world would be in a sodom
[1:28:50] condition it said it was then the son of
[1:28:53] man will be revealed that day see this
[1:28:55] son
[1:28:56] this man that
[1:28:58] come down in the form of a man which was
[1:29:00] elohim by abraham before this promised
[1:29:02] son came look what what it was abraham
[1:29:05] said it was god the bible said it was
[1:29:07] three men
[1:29:09] come to him dust on their clothes travel
[1:29:11] sit down and eat like men and jesus said
[1:29:13] just at the time the world gets in a
[1:29:15] sodden condition then the son of man
[1:29:17] will reveal himself again not son of god
[1:29:20] son of man see would reveal himself now
[1:29:24] mark that
[1:29:25] with what the last prophet said behold i
[1:29:27] send you elijah the prophet he will
[1:29:29] restore the hearts of the children back
[1:29:31] to the father see a message to bring
[1:29:33] them back to the bible
[1:29:36] and the son of man will be revealing
[1:29:38] himself in that day
[1:29:40] and that day of the sounding of the last
[1:29:42] church age the seventh angel
[1:29:45] the mysteries of god should be made
[1:29:47] known in that day the seven seals would
[1:29:49] be broken the mysteries of all these
[1:29:51] churches and things how that would
[1:29:52] happen
[1:29:54] and what what taken place
[1:29:57] to see the day that we i know
[1:30:01] this is all i mean this is all
[1:30:04] common but you know i tell you what
[1:30:07] if it ever gets common to you
[1:30:10] we we need to get in the altar
[1:30:12] but i tell you what it it stirs your
[1:30:13] soul one because when you realize what
[1:30:15] god has done for us in our day to see
[1:30:17] the restoration that's come
[1:30:19] what god has done for us in our day and
[1:30:21] i'm not i'm not going to be able to
[1:30:23] finish this but i do i do want to read
[1:30:25] this this one quote this is from from
[1:30:27] here ye him
[1:30:29] and may look at some of this later on
[1:30:31] sometime but
[1:30:32] this is this is number 19 brothers this
[1:30:34] is the last one
[1:30:38] brother brahms says
[1:30:40] he said i've begun to realize he said
[1:30:42] that i'm not no boy no more and what
[1:30:45] i've got to do i've i got to do it right
[1:30:47] away for one thing
[1:30:49] then another thing knowing that the
[1:30:51] coming the lord is so close that hand
[1:30:52] what type of people should we be how
[1:30:55] should we
[1:30:56] conduct ourselves and how should we be
[1:30:58] waiting with great enthusiasm and
[1:31:00] anticipation waiting for the coming of
[1:31:02] the lord winning every soul to christ
[1:31:04] that we can for the hour is getting
[1:31:06] darker and darker as the storm clouds of
[1:31:08] unbelief and skepticism move over our
[1:31:11] beloved nation but it's time to thrust
[1:31:14] in the sickle now and get what we can
[1:31:16] i've often wondered well lord
[1:31:20] you'll you'll have this you'll have to
[1:31:22] have a great this or that before you
[1:31:24] come well i've read
[1:31:26] i then read a scripture here a few weeks
[1:31:28] ago that changed my opinion on that
[1:31:32] you know the lord is coming for a great
[1:31:34] church that's right but we've had 2 000
[1:31:36] years making up that church there's
[1:31:38] already waiting out yonder for the
[1:31:40] resurrection and and who went down in
[1:31:42] the faith the fathers and mothers who
[1:31:44] fought to win the prize and sell through
[1:31:45] bloody seas what type of people should
[1:31:48] we be today
[1:31:50] he said there isn't one thing left i see
[1:31:52] in the prophetic word one thing left or
[1:31:55] one thing hindering the coming of the
[1:31:57] lord jesus christ
[1:31:59] this very hour not one thing left in the
[1:32:01] bible everything has been fulfilled
[1:32:02] waiting now for the coming of the lord
[1:32:04] jesus and now
[1:32:07] should we
[1:32:08] how should we do
[1:32:09] this afternoon we should speak and act
[1:32:12] today as if this is the last hour we'll
[1:32:14] ever have and who knows but what it
[1:32:17] might be
[1:32:18] it may be
[1:32:20] for some of us and it may be
[1:32:22] for all of us
[1:32:23] but let's act as if it's our last hour
[1:32:26] let's pray as never before
[1:32:28] and let's be a blessing
[1:32:31] to others and try to do all we can for
[1:32:33] remember this is only one time that
[1:32:35] we're mortal from this on
[1:32:37] from the time that we leave this leave
[1:32:39] this world we go
[1:32:41] into another world and we'll never have
[1:32:44] the opportunity to win one soul in that
[1:32:46] world all that's going to be one will be
[1:32:48] one right now and if this
[1:32:51] and if this may be our last hour then
[1:32:54] what
[1:32:55] should we do
[1:32:56] on this hour
[1:32:58] amen well god bless you this evening
[1:33:00] let's all stand
[1:33:05] i just want to read that because as
[1:33:09] what kind of people should we be
[1:33:11] when we see the hour
[1:33:14] and we see the fulfillment of god's word
[1:33:18] in this hour and the you see the
[1:33:22] the world is blind to it
[1:33:25] and god is trying to make himself known
[1:33:27] to the world and
[1:33:29] and speak through the word
[1:33:35] and he's beginning to speak and continue
[1:33:37] to speak and
[1:33:38] and people have not received it
[1:33:41] and so many have that have gathered
[1:33:43] around the word
[1:33:45] but they've not got in the word
[1:33:48] and what kind of people should we ought
[1:33:49] to be
[1:33:51] if we realize this is our last day
[1:33:55] only thing that we do for god is the
[1:33:56] only thing that'll count
[1:34:00] and that's that's
[1:34:01] what i want to leave you with tonight i
[1:34:03] wanted i want to give my all
[1:34:06] and
[1:34:08] i fell miserably but i i still have that
[1:34:10] desire that's my desire
[1:34:14] to see each one of you
[1:34:18] go further in god
[1:34:21] to do whatever you have need of that's
[1:34:22] what i'll that's what i want to see
[1:34:28] you know it it'd be it'd be a terrible
[1:34:30] thing
[1:34:33] to wait to reach that day and then you
[1:34:36] realize you know what
[1:34:39] when you've not done all when you've not
[1:34:40] done your all
[1:34:42] will you not give your all amen
[1:34:45] and i i i realize that you know
[1:34:49] you're predestinated
[1:34:51] to reach that goal but you know i want i
[1:34:52] want to make sure that my voice is on
[1:34:54] record just like brother ramsay my voice
[1:34:56] is on record crying out
[1:34:59] and telling people to turn from that
[1:35:03] he said if you saw somebody going over
[1:35:04] going to that great cataracts
[1:35:07] and he said you know they're in that
[1:35:08] boat and they're not going to make it
[1:35:11] he said
[1:35:12] he said if in love he said you'd be
[1:35:14] screaming out to them
[1:35:16] to give every every heed to them to let
[1:35:19] them know listen you you've got to heed
[1:35:21] my warning you're not going to make it
[1:35:25] and i want everybody to understand that
[1:35:28] there's so many people that
[1:35:30] and i you know we just can't be
[1:35:33] we just can't be relaxed about it
[1:35:36] i
[1:35:37] i can say i've spent too many years that
[1:35:39] same way
[1:35:44] and
[1:35:45] but i i i just have i just have a desire
[1:35:48] you know i look back at brother branham
[1:35:50] and and he was talking about
[1:35:52] he said boy if you're ever going to do
[1:35:53] anything
[1:35:54] he said you need to do it now
[1:35:56] he'd never been around the world seven
[1:35:57] times
[1:36:00] he's like well if brother brown thought
[1:36:02] he hadn't done nothing been around the
[1:36:03] world seven times and he's speaking to a
[1:36:05] lady one time said i've probably been in
[1:36:08] front of her spoke to a million people
[1:36:13] it's like well and i
[1:36:15] ain't touched but a fraction of that
[1:36:18] and if brother brown said he hadn't done
[1:36:19] anything well i sure hadn't done
[1:36:21] anything
[1:36:23] but you know i want to be faithful in
