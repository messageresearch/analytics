[22:34] savior we thank you we Praise Your Great
[22:37] Name this is not a gathering just to
[22:39] gather together to kill time or to take
[22:43] up some space or something somewhere but
[22:45] it's gather together to learn about you
[22:49] we ask you to just come on the scene now
[22:50] and speak to our hearts and Lord forgive
[22:53] our sins because we want to be cleansed
[22:56] and made right in you and Worthy and the
[22:58] only way we can be worthy is to stand in
[23:00] you and this have your way now as we
[23:03] read the word come and speak to us about
[23:05] it and let your light shine bless those
[23:07] that are not here you know the reasons
[23:10] so we commit it all into your hands we
[23:12] love you in Jesus name amen amen
[23:17] Matthew
[23:20] 5:37 but let your communication be yay
[23:23] yay nay nay for whatsoever is more than
[23:27] these cometh of evil you have heard that
[23:29] it hath been said an eye for an eye and
[23:31] a tooth for a tooth but I say unto you
[23:34] see that was the Old Testament that was
[23:35] all little thing that was that was there
[23:38] but he set in a new way now new thought
[23:40] but I say unto you that you resist not
[23:42] evil but who soever that you resist not
[23:45] evil but whosoever shall smite thee on
[23:48] thy right cheek turn to him the other
[23:51] also and if any man will sue thee at the
[23:54] law and take away thy coat let him have
[23:57] thy cloak also and whosoever shall
[24:00] compel thee to go a mild go with him
[24:02] Twain give to him that asketh thee and
[24:05] from him that would Bor of thee turn not
[24:08] thou away ye have heard that it hath
[24:10] been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor
[24:13] and hate thine enemy but I say unto you
[24:16] love your enemies bless them that curse
[24:18] you do good to them that hate you and
[24:21] pray for them which despitefully use you
[24:23] and persecute you why that you may be
[24:27] the children
[24:28] of your father which is in heaven for he
[24:30] maketh his son to rise on the evil and
[24:33] on the good and sendeth rain on the just
[24:35] and on the unjust for if you love them
[24:38] which love you what reward have ye do
[24:41] not even the publicans Asain and if you
[24:44] salute your brethren only what do you
[24:47] more than others do not even the
[24:49] Publican so be therefore perfect even as
[24:52] your father in Heaven which is as your
[24:56] father which is in heaven is perfect now
[24:58] we'll go to verse
[25:01] 20 of the same chapter cuz remember we
[25:04] were reading that this morning what be
[25:05] you therefore
[25:07] perfect the requirement all right now
[25:10] adding another requirement verse 20 for
[25:12] I say unto you that except your
[25:14] righteousness shall exceed the
[25:16] righteousness of the scribes and
[25:18] Pharisees you shall in no case enter
[25:21] into the Kingdom of Heaven you may be
[25:24] seated the Lord add his Blessing to the
[25:28] of the
[25:29] word now we were trying to talk about
[25:33] his righteousness and I told brother Joe
[25:35] just make it part two and we'll uh
[25:38] probably push what I was going to speak
[25:40] on over until next Sunday way to be
[25:43] preaching Wednesday so you know we'll be
[25:45] you doing that and and all and
[25:51] but as I said
[25:53] then it's
[25:56] required that we be perfect right we
[26:00] read that over and over and over and
[26:01] over and we keep on reading
[26:05] it it's required that we be perfect
[26:07] that's
[26:08] right and if God required it right then
[26:12] how could we as human Mortals ever think
[26:15] about it right but if he required it
[26:18] then he had to make a way right and he
[26:22] made a way because he came himself amen
[26:25] that's making the way for you and I all
[26:27] right now we're reading that we have got
[26:30] to be just as
[26:32] righteous you know unless our
[26:34] righteousness exceeds goes beyond excels
[26:37] further than the righteousness of the
[26:40] scribes and Pharisees and you think
[26:42] about it as I said then the high priest
[26:45] so you would talk about him and Paul
[26:47] saying blindess according to the law you
[26:51] know and uh that Pharisee standing there
[26:55] to go into the temple if they was
[26:57] anything could be found against him a
[26:59] mark whatsoever he was killed all right
[27:04] because of that because he was standing
[27:05] for
[27:07] something but we've got to exceed that
[27:10] right you know we've got to go beyond
[27:12] that all right now how can we go beyond
[27:15] the fact that we were talking about the
[27:18] word righteous bringing it down from
[27:21] righteousness down to righteous and then
[27:23] bringing it on back to stating where it
[27:25] begins at which is the word right
[27:28] you know the word right is where you
[27:30] begin at uh then it's righteous meaning
[27:33] going on over and then righteousness
[27:36] meaning his impartation unto us you know
[27:40] as we were going through perfect and
[27:42] imperfection Perfection being the fact
[27:45] that it relates to the god coming within
[27:48] us to live out all right if you remember
[27:50] that now then the fact of being right
[27:55] well Paul was right right so then
[27:58] concerning the law he was righteous
[28:01] right he was not
[28:03] guilty cuz that's what he said cuz it
[28:06] wasn't then like it is now of just the
[28:09] thoughts and and things back then if you
[28:12] didn't do anything you wasn't guilty as
[28:14] I said the other day it may sound funny
[28:16] but it would it be easier to live under
[28:18] the law to try to do anything and be
[28:21] good about it than it is today right
[28:24] because under the law if you didn't do
[28:26] it he wasn't guilty now there was
[28:29] nothing there that said that if you
[28:31] thought about it right you know right it
[28:35] wasn't there in the Old Testament all
[28:38] right but when you come into the New
[28:39] Testament to just think about it right
[28:42] see it's magnified to where that just
[28:45] our thoughts now are recorded against us
[28:48] all right see then we must exceed the
[28:52] righteousness of a man that would be
[28:54] standing there perfectly Justified
[28:58] right remember Justified as though you
[29:01] never done
[29:02] it right so then to be in that state
[29:07] what would a person
[29:10] be but the one that I say that spent his
[29:13] time to and would stand and say what he
[29:17] was would turn around and say I found
[29:21] that to be death that's
[29:24] right now is Paul saying
[29:28] you know cuz evidently they must have
[29:30] thought
[29:31] that and I know people thinking about me
[29:34] that's why I'm quick to quote things lot
[29:36] and they think well you don't believe in
[29:38] living
[29:39] right now where would you get that idea
[29:43] at see right so they evidently thought
[29:47] Paul was saying that because he was so
[29:50] adamant about laying down the the
[29:53] position and
[29:56] talking that
[29:58] they said well Paul shall we
[30:02] sin Let there be more grace yeah we need
[30:06] Grace so let's just sin you know let's
[30:08] just send a whole lot more and we you
[30:10] know let it abound which means he bow it
[30:14] up I don't think he smiled when he said
[30:17] that no when he concluded it he said God
[30:22] forbid cuz if I offer my members to that
[30:26] y
[30:27] then I am connected to that is that
[30:29] paraphrasing what he was saying
[30:33] right then no matter how good we could
[30:35] think we
[30:38] are we could never come to the
[30:42] place to be righteous amen or just or
[30:47] perfect right right there had to be an
[30:50] atonement amen that made them perfect
[30:54] right right without the atonment of the
[30:57] Old Testament they was not perfect all
[31:00] right without the atonement in the New
[31:02] Testament we're not
[31:04] perfect all right no matter what we
[31:06] think or no matter what we could say
[31:08] that we're not guilty
[31:10] right we're Guilty by the fact of who we
[31:13] are right that's right we were born in
[31:16] sin the pro said I hate to think I had
[31:18] to go to heaven on the basis of being
[31:20] born 5 minutes ago right what could a
[31:22] five minute old baby do right no but it
[31:25] was a product of sin right right it was
[31:28] death to start with right all right so
[31:32] then there there's no way to try to
[31:34] accumulate
[31:36] anything well if I could just do so much
[31:40] you
[31:41] know and you know if I could do this if
[31:43] I could do that then it it would would
[31:46] bring me to the
[31:48] place
[31:51] no wouldn't work right no matter what we
[31:55] do it won't work it's got to be by
[31:59] faith all right so we brought in Abraham
[32:03] then of Genesis 15 this
[32:05] morning and bringing it in to show that
[32:08] he believed the
[32:10] Lord and it was counted or reckoned or
[32:15] imputed unto him for righteousness
[32:21] amen he believed the Lord amen Noah I
[32:25] said believe the Lord offered to
[32:27] sacrifice was called perfect right job
[32:30] believed the Lord offered a sa called
[32:32] Perfect all right now so the Perfection
[32:36] and remember we brought out the other
[32:37] night was the Perfection by the law of
[32:40] keeping it or was Perfection by Grace
[32:44] that's right of believing what God has
[32:46] done righten the atonement which one is
[32:49] it right so we have to conclude that it
[32:52] would have to be the atonement
[32:54] right because it couldn't work then we
[32:57] went through
[32:59] Romans this morning Romans 4 talking
[33:03] about Abraham Y and how that it could
[33:06] not have been some thing that Abraham
[33:09] was a great righteous man because even
[33:11] the Bible
[33:13] said did he believe God when he was in
[33:16] uncircumcision that's
[33:19] right he believe God when it was still
[33:21] just in the uncircumcision state all
[33:24] right now CU Abraham was a gentile it
[33:28] was not a Jew that was over in the book
[33:30] of Jude I mean the book of the Jew when
[33:33] Jude come along in in second king
[33:37] Judah all right
[33:40] now so then Paul sums it up in our
[33:44] reading this morning that there was
[33:46] nothing for you to Glory that's
[33:50] right Paul was saying then that I have
[33:53] not done these
[33:55] things
[33:58] I'm
[33:59] blameless but he said I found that to be
[34:03] death right right all
[34:06] right and I want to be found in him not
[34:09] having my own righteousness we get to it
[34:11] in a little while but the righteousness
[34:14] which is by
[34:16] faith all right we read this morning
[34:18] where brother R said well we need more
[34:20] than anything is a revelation amen right
[34:23] the Bible says we're just as righteous
[34:25] as God Is by being in Jesus
[34:29] Christ and by being
[34:31] that then we have
[34:35] to depend on him right amen not to think
[34:39] of anything we could do or not do right
[34:41] right that's
[34:43] commendable see when I say things like
[34:45] that you say like like Paul should we
[34:47] sin that Grace May abound that's what
[34:49] the Mind goes to but listen I believe in
[34:53] living right amen that's right y all
[34:56] right
[34:57] I believe in trying to be
[34:59] right whether I be a Christian or
[35:04] not I want my family to have an
[35:08] opportunity to be able to look at it and
[35:11] say well at least Daddy tried right to
[35:14] live right I told you about the time we
[35:16] was riding around the road ter said
[35:18] we've been over and look this man's land
[35:20] and he and heard about this long old
[35:22] Shaggy thing you know we was going back
[35:24] around the road and he said Daddy I'm
[35:27] glad you don't look like
[35:31] that what do you mean he said well I
[35:34] want to look like
[35:36] that see so that's I want the kids to
[35:39] have an
[35:40] opportunity and I want you as a church
[35:42] to have an opportunity to hear the truth
[35:46] amen cuz that's what I set you free amen
[35:49] all right see no matter what I am then
[35:52] that's what I'm desire is for you to
[35:53] hear the word right in the correct order
[35:56] right you know because that's that's the
[35:58] point I want to do because then we got
[36:00] to have everything is by faith
[36:03] right everything is by Revelation right
[36:07] all right now let's deal with that a
[36:10] minute to think about it and think about
[36:13] some more scriptures that we were on
[36:14] this morning that go ahead and turn to
[36:17] Romans
[36:18] 3 and to think
[36:20] about everything being coming to you by
[36:23] Faith by what you can believe
[36:27] cuz you know Revelation is first
[36:30] what mental Faith right mental ability
[36:34] to
[36:35] believe to accept and then when our
[36:39] mental ability becomes the prophet said
[36:41] a spiritual Revelation that's right
[36:44] right then we get begin to get something
[36:47] we can stand
[36:48] on all right so it's a revelation we
[36:51] need it revealed to us that we're just
[36:53] as righteous as God is right but brother
[36:55] R said to accept the fact fact that he
[36:58] died for
[37:00] us and surely we want to accept
[37:03] that then we must accept that he has
[37:05] made us just as righteous as he is cuz
[37:09] he said to accept one is to accept the
[37:11] other to reject one right is to reject
[37:14] the other if you reject that you're just
[37:16] as righteous as God Is by being having
[37:18] the new birth being in Jesus Christ then
[37:20] you rejected he died for you right and
[37:23] you understand that statements he said
[37:24] we need it revealed amen mhm
[37:27] do we need to pray for a revelation more
[37:28] than anything in the world that's right
[37:30] you don't need to pray who's going to be
[37:32] president or what's going to be that's
[37:33] right you know God take care of that he
[37:36] said I put in Kings I take out Kings
[37:38] he'll have all that won't be no problem
[37:41] that's right we just leave it alone
[37:43] right go right on down the road say
[37:45] Glory Hallelujah you know for the the
[37:48] Lord to handle everything all right
[37:50] let's go to Romans and let's pick up
[37:51] kind of where we left off this
[37:54] morning and I want to continue on just a
[37:56] little bit on this
[38:00] anyway because I want you to
[38:03] see that like we're talking about
[38:04] Abraham believed
[38:06] God and it was
[38:09] counted now I've got about
[38:11] four statements from people saying what
[38:15] I asked the question this morning that
[38:17] blessed is the man to whom God will not
[38:19] impute sin you know if any others have a
[38:22] comment or thought bring it to me and
[38:25] let's see if we can determine who that
[38:27] man can
[38:28] be all
[38:30] right that you know God won't impute sin
[38:33] all right now so we just bring them
[38:36] maybe we'll get them on next Sunday
[38:38] Romans 3 let's begin reading about verse
[38:41] 19 I wish you'd read all up and down you
[38:45] know where you could understand looking
[38:48] over at verse 10 he says there's none
[38:50] righteous no not one right though we
[38:52] don't have any all right so let's go to
[38:54] verse 19 for we know that what things
[38:57] soever the law
[39:00] saith it saith to them who are under the
[39:05] law now is that sensible enough it's
[39:07] talking to people that are under the law
[39:09] that every mouth may be
[39:11] stopped and all the the world may become
[39:15] guilty before God all right so now the
[39:19] law made us guilty y it didn't save us
[39:23] there's no salvation in the law listen
[39:26] right there was salvation to people when
[39:28] the law was in existence that made the
[39:31] atonement that done the correct thing
[39:33] but there was no salvation in the law
[39:37] right it was a condemner a Record
[39:41] Keeper Paul said everything was going
[39:43] pretty good till the law came
[39:46] y could it become a Record Keeper of us
[39:49] so watch what it's getting
[39:53] there therefore by the Deeds of the law
[39:57] there shall no flesh be justified in his
[40:00] sight for by the law is the knowledge of
[40:07] sin Paul said I wouldn't have known that
[40:10] it was wrong to lust if the Bible hadn't
[40:13] said Thou shalt not cover it you know
[40:15] something like
[40:16] that see it made us
[40:19] condemned well wouldn't it be then if we
[40:22] could think of anything that would try
[40:23] to save us wouldn't that be a
[40:25] condemnation instead of
[40:27] right that's what I don't understand
[40:29] when we want to consider even a thought
[40:32] right it's wonderful to be
[40:34] good when I say a moment ago people
[40:37] misunderstand that it's wonderful to be
[40:38] good I wish everybody was good wouldn't
[40:41] it be something if everybody in the
[40:43] world was good and trying to be
[40:46] right I'd probably be trying to go to
[40:48] the Moon
[40:51] cuz I know something's wrong cuz it
[40:54] ain't going to work all right would it
[40:56] be
[40:57] nice would it be something you could
[40:59] trust everybody in the
[41:01] world
[41:03] Amen I mean you young kids don't even
[41:05] know what in the world I'm talking about
[41:07] man used to have a store right there
[41:08] where WS were the edge of his yard and
[41:13] the man had a store
[41:15] there and he farmed and he built houses
[41:17] and things he's gone all the time so you
[41:19] just went to the store you went in the
[41:22] store and got what you wanted and you
[41:24] wrote it down charg this to my bill sign
[41:27] Samuel Dale or you just laid the money
[41:29] down on the
[41:30] counter to pay for
[41:34] it Y and this went on
[41:39] on you want to try it now
[41:44] no but so it's getting worse listen but
[41:49] now what the law then would be what
[41:52] would bring a knowledge of sin now watch
[41:55] it but but now the righteousness of God
[42:00] without the
[42:02] law watch
[42:04] it much righteousness of God without the
[42:07] law
[42:10] right now you see it in the next verse
[42:12] part of what it
[42:14] is for righteousness of God without the
[42:17] law is manifested what being
[42:20] witnessed by the law and the prophets
[42:24] now the law and the prophets Tes if IED
[42:27] spoke of
[42:29] witnessed that there was coming a
[42:32] time that it would not be the
[42:35] righteousness of the law that you would
[42:37] be going
[42:38] by you see what Paul's saying right see
[42:42] read the scripture just read it for
[42:43] yourself but now the righteousness of
[42:45] God without the
[42:47] law is manifested are made
[42:51] known and what is it it's witnessed by
[42:54] the law and the prophets right so
[42:56] everything that was done back there is a
[42:58] witness that it would be coming a day
[43:02] that the law and the things would not be
[43:04] in existence but it would be the law of
[43:07] Jesus Christ right from the inward man
[43:11] all right right now cuz that's what it
[43:13] said being witness manifested all right
[43:17] what is it now what is this to be that
[43:19] the law and the prophet spoke of even
[43:22] the righteousness of God which is by
[43:25] faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon
[43:29] all them that believe there is no
[43:32] difference for all have sin and come
[43:34] short of the glory of
[43:37] God what's now being justified
[43:42] freely being made perfect
[43:45] right
[43:47] righteous how by his grace through the
[43:51] Redemption that is in Christ
[43:53] Jesus whom God has set forth to be be
[43:56] what a perpetuation or one who stands in
[43:59] the between and taking care you
[44:02] know through faith in his
[44:05] blood to declare his
[44:09] righteousness for the remission of sins
[44:11] that are passed through the forbearance
[44:13] of God now so then the Catholics wrong
[44:16] when they say you can pay for sins
[44:18] before you do it yeah but Paul said it
[44:20] was the sins of pist right you don't get
[44:22] forgiveness what you going to do
[44:24] tomorrow no sir don't ask God to forgive
[44:27] you you're going to go do
[44:29] something you ask God to forgive you
[44:31] what You' done
[44:34] what to declare I say at this time his
[44:39] righteousness right that he might be
[44:42] just and the justifier of him which
[44:46] believeth in
[44:48] Jesus
[44:50] now where is boasting then Paul said M
[44:55] it is
[44:57] excluded right there's nothing you and I
[45:01] can brag
[45:03] about right right nothing
[45:07] period it is
[45:09] excluded yep all
[45:14] right where is boasting then it is
[45:17] excluded by what law of Works nay right
[45:22] but by the law of Faith right therefore
[45:26] M we
[45:27] conclude now what does that
[45:31] mean I'm going to sum up everything that
[45:33] I'm saying right here and I'm going to
[45:35] bring it to a conclusion amen
[45:38] right and I'm going to tell you
[45:42] now Galatians 1:8 if you add anything to
[45:46] what I'm fixing to say or how say it you
[45:49] are cursed right that good enough right
[45:53] well now brother that's over there and
[45:54] this is over here all all the word right
[45:58] so what does he
[46:00] say therefore we
[46:03] conclude that a man is justified by
[46:07] faith without the Deeds y of the law
[46:12] right now that's his
[46:15] conclusion that you're justified by
[46:17] faith faith is a revelation right okay
[46:21] let's get more what Paul said let's go
[46:22] to to
[46:24] Philippians
[46:31] Philippians
[46:33] 3 let's get these things of what Paul is
[46:37] saying and then we can make a
[46:45] conclusion Philippians 3 verse
[46:49] 8 he's coming down verse 6 is where he
[46:51] says that that concerning Zeal
[46:54] persecuting the church touching the
[46:55] righteous which is in the law blameless
[46:58] but what things were gained to me those
[47:01] I counted lost for God for Christ Y
[47:04] doubtly and I can all things but lost
[47:07] for the Excellency of the knowledge of
[47:10] Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have
[47:14] suffered the loss of many things and do
[47:16] count them but dumb that I may win
[47:19] Christ and what and be found in him not
[47:23] having my own righteousness which is of
[47:25] the law right the righteousness which is
[47:29] of the law it means you're not guilty
[47:31] that's the righteousness of the
[47:33] law means you're not guilty you didn't
[47:36] do it right
[47:40] now but that which is that which is
[47:43] through the Faith of Christ the
[47:45] righteousness which is of god by
[47:49] faith all right how are you going to be
[47:52] righteous by faith what's Faith a
[47:55] revelation
[47:57] Revelation is of God's word so when are
[47:59] we going to start believing What God
[48:03] Says true right that should be the point
[48:06] right right
[48:11] Titus you like me some of these are hard
[48:13] to find so get over next to
[48:15] Hebrews and fill them and then draw back
[48:18] to
[48:19] Titus Titus
[48:23] 3 read all up and down below this you
[48:25] know above them and all like that but
[48:28] just to try to get a
[48:31] point not by works of righteousness
[48:34] which we have done but according to his
[48:37] Mercy he saved us by the washing of the
[48:41] Regeneration and renewing of the Holy
[48:44] Ghost which he said on us abundantly
[48:46] through CHR Jesus Christ Our Savior that
[48:49] being justified by his
[48:52] grace we should be made ours according
[48:55] to Hope of eternal life
[48:59] right being justified by his
[49:04] Grace Grace righteousness peace
[49:07] Perfection all goes together right
[49:11] Hebrews
[49:13] 11 just to bring in a lot of scripture
[49:16] today
[49:18] amen Hebrews
[49:20] 11:7 by faith Noah being warned of God
[49:24] of things not yet as
[49:26] seen moved with fear prepared an ark to
[49:30] the saving of his
[49:31] house what's now he believed God and he
[49:36] done what God Said right now watch what
[49:40] happened by the which words by doing
[49:44] what he done by the which he condemned
[49:47] the
[49:49] world and became air of the
[49:53] righteousness which is by faith
[49:56] right he condemned the World by doing
[49:59] what he done because he believed God and
[50:00] done what God told him and he became air
[50:03] of righteousness by doing so
[50:09] James D to line it up a little bit but
[50:12] couldn't all
[50:13] little James
[50:16] 2
[50:22] 23 and the scripture was fulfilled with
[50:25] say
[50:26] Abraham believed God and it was imputed
[50:29] unto him for righteousness and he was
[50:32] called
[50:35] what the friend of
[50:39] God cuz he do what God told
[50:42] him he became God's friend amen but he
[50:45] believe God all right okay well going
[50:48] over to John let's see one minute second
[50:50] Peter let's go to Second Peter
[50:53] 1 and verse one
[50:58] Simon Peter a servant and Apostle of
[51:00] Jesus Christ to them that have obtained
[51:02] like Precious Faith with
[51:05] us
[51:08] through that's right how
[51:12] through the righteousness of God and our
[51:15] Savior Jesus
[51:20] Christ like Precious
[51:23] Faith through
[51:26] the righteousness of God 1
[51:29] John 2 and
[51:38] 29 if you know that he is
[51:43] righteous ye know that everyone that
[51:47] doeth
[51:49] righteousness is born of
[51:51] God now what does it mean to doeth
[51:54] righteousness
[51:58] well I don't do
[52:01] it I thought we were concluding the fact
[52:04] that we were the righteousness comes by
[52:10] faith I thought we were bringing the
[52:12] point out that the righteousness that
[52:14] we're talking about was by
[52:16] faith all right and if it be by
[52:21] faith then everyone that
[52:24] doeth which would carry over to the word
[52:30] righteousness because it's something
[52:32] working within
[52:36] us by grace are we saved through faith
[52:39] amen
[52:40] amen right and it would come out to be
[52:45] then that if we're born of
[52:52] God then is God doing in US
[52:57] his own righteousness right all right
[53:01] right second
[53:06] Corinthians that's the one we had this
[53:09] morning we used I
[53:11] think
[53:18] five I better get out of First
[53:21] Corinthians wouldn't read too
[53:24] good
[53:29] well this will be the background for
[53:31] later so let's drop up here to verse
[53:34] 16 and this might answer your
[53:38] question of who is the man that God will
[53:41] impute sin
[53:42] right verse 16 wherefore henceforth know
[53:45] we no man after the flesh ye though we
[53:49] have known Christ after the flesh yet
[53:51] now henceforth know we him no more what
[53:54] after the FLH flesh we don't go by the
[53:56] flesh we don't go by hunted and fished
[53:58] with him I done this I done that and and
[54:00] I got to be there no no no like a man
[54:03] told me one time he was sincere and I
[54:04] wouldn't don't make me lie to nobody but
[54:07] he told me he said Brother D I love the
[54:08] prophet and his family and he said if I
[54:10] love him he said I'd be there well if
[54:13] that's what he's you know I ain't going
[54:14] to condemn him cuz that's his thoughts
[54:17] and he died with that thought right
[54:19] believing that he' love the prophet's
[54:21] family and he'd be there you know I
[54:24] think it's all onc Grace I didn't know
[54:25] it was that way but that's all
[54:28] right therefore If any man be in Christ
[54:31] he is a new creature old things are
[54:33] passed away behold all things are become
[54:35] new and all things are of God who hath
[54:38] reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ
[54:40] and had give hath given to us the
[54:42] ministry of reconciliation what to with
[54:45] to understand that God was in Christ
[54:47] reconciling the world and to himself not
[54:50] imputing their transgressions unto
[54:52] them and have committed unto us the word
[54:55] of reconciliation now
[54:59] why it
[55:02] if if I read that
[55:04] correctly I I didn't know that I was to
[55:07] be imputing your transgressions that's
[55:09] what I thought it was
[55:11] saying uh you know that's what everybody
[55:14] wants to condemn everybody else but
[55:16] don't realize that they're being
[55:18] condemned
[55:20] themselves all
[55:22] right now we are an ambassador for
[55:25] Christ as though God did beseech You by
[55:28] us we pray you in Christ de be you
[55:30] reconciled to God for Heath made him to
[55:33] be sin for us who knew no
[55:39] sin now what why in other
[55:42] words
[55:43] that we might be made the righteousness
[55:47] of God in
[55:50] him he became sin
[55:53] right for you and I
[55:56] that we might be made his righteousness
[55:58] all right Galatians 2 I think maybe we
[56:03] read that but let's
[56:05] see but I wrote all these down this
[56:11] yesterday no this the one was that is
[56:16] one what is it let's go to Galatians 2
[56:18] we'll read it see what it is I got 2 20
[56:22] and 21 right I am crucified with Christ
[56:25] nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ
[56:27] liveth in me and the life which I now
[56:30] live in the flesh I live by the faith of
[56:32] the Son of God who loved me and gave
[56:34] himself for me I do not frustrate the
[56:37] grace of
[56:39] God for if righteousness come by the
[56:43] law then
[56:45] Christ died in
[56:50] vain right if he gave us the new
[56:53] birth
[56:56] that mean he took our place as we just
[57:00] read and then we can think about being
[57:02] righteous by him coming and living in
[57:06] us all right so now he's
[57:10] saying for if righteousness come by the
[57:13] law Christ died in vain yep right you
[57:17] wouldn't have no inheritance but let's
[57:19] go what we got one more
[57:22] Romans 5
[57:32] verse
[57:35] 17 for it by one man's offense death
[57:39] Reign by one much more they which
[57:42] receive abundance of
[57:45] Grace and of the gift of
[57:49] righteousness till reign in life by
[57:52] Jesus Christ what is the gift of
[57:53] righteousness
[57:57] what is the gift of
[57:59] righteousness ver is a gift right right
[58:03] if it's a gift it's not something you
[58:05] work for you work for something it's
[58:07] payment right it's a
[58:11] gift but it's the gift of
[58:13] righteousness which is the baptism of
[58:15] the Holy Ghost or eternal life right so
[58:18] he gave us his own
[58:20] life paid the price P give us his own
[58:23] life what that we could be righteous as
[58:25] he is amen are you following me see then
[58:30] if he gave us those
[58:32] things then let's see I'm trying to look
[58:35] at
[58:40] what let make
[58:46] sure the gift of
[58:49] righteousness shall reign in life by
[58:52] Jesus by one Jesus Christ right
[58:55] yep be able to rule and
[59:00] Reign because we're just as righteous as
[59:02] he is right amen
[59:06] yep not by our works right righten by
[59:10] what we can believe that's right right
[59:12] but then after we're born
[59:15] again I dare us to say Well it don't
[59:18] matter what I
[59:19] do
[59:21] right now you can never realize that
[59:24] that it wasn't something you
[59:26] done to get you
[59:29] saved all right you said well I realize
[59:32] that well then why would we want to
[59:35] think about something after then that we
[59:37] could just live and get by with it right
[59:40] I want to r with him don't you
[59:43] amen I want to reign with
[59:46] righteousness rightness the fact of
[59:49] being
[59:52] right you just think when we get there
[59:54] when these days folks these scriptures
[59:56] going to mean a lot of things to usen
[59:58] right so we're going to see what it's
[1:00:00] all
[1:00:02] been cuz see our righteousness we
[1:00:05] talking about this morning is what
[1:00:07] filthy rags right on the S of God
[1:00:11] anything that we would think to make us
[1:00:13] good or whatever is filthy rags that's
[1:00:17] right all right but now do you know what
[1:00:20] his name really
[1:00:23] is
[1:00:28] Jeremiah like me Isaiah
[1:00:33] Jeremiah Jeremiah
[1:00:36] 23 let's see what his name
[1:00:39] is if his name then it's got to be our
[1:00:44] name right amen I have you got it
[1:00:48] Jeremiah
[1:00:51] 23 look at verse 6
[1:00:56] in his days Judah shall be saved and
[1:00:59] Israel shall dwell
[1:01:01] safely and this is his name whereby he
[1:01:04] shall be
[1:01:06] called the Lord our
[1:01:11] righteousness Jehovah dis Canute
[1:01:15] Y which means our righteousness amen
[1:01:18] that's his
[1:01:20] name I thought that when we get over
[1:01:23] there in Revelations about
[1:01:25] 19 that he comes back riding on a white
[1:01:27] horse and he has a name written no more
[1:01:30] no man
[1:01:32] knows what is it it's his
[1:01:35] righteousness you know we have that same
[1:01:37] name written on us
[1:01:41] am our
[1:01:43] righteousness the Lord our righteous
[1:01:46] notice it it's all in capital form
[1:01:49] that's right emphasizing what it's
[1:01:52] talking about now
[1:01:57] if that's his name as I said that would
[1:01:59] be our
[1:02:02] name can we all have the same name we're
[1:02:05] one family but I thought we read over
[1:02:07] there in in um
[1:02:10] Matthew that we would be that generation
[1:02:13] or be his children that's right if we're
[1:02:16] his children then we have the same name
[1:02:18] that's why everybody's looking for some
[1:02:19] kind of a new name
[1:02:21] situation I have exhausted the name of
[1:02:24] Jesus yet that's right though I'll just
[1:02:27] keep preaching
[1:02:29] that and then if there is a new name
[1:02:31] then he'll reveal it but if I don't
[1:02:33] exhaust the
[1:02:36] name you know in other words if I don't
[1:02:38] understand the name and what all the
[1:02:40] name is
[1:02:41] about how would I be able to understand
[1:02:43] a new one
[1:02:46] amen because it would require some new
[1:02:50] thing well let's just keep on where
[1:02:52] we're going and God reveals something to
[1:02:54] you
[1:02:55] you tell me about it amen he revealed it
[1:02:57] to me I'll tell you about it right my
[1:02:59] brother R said one thing about it you
[1:03:01] can't conjure it right right he said
[1:03:03] it'd be a revelation so
[1:03:06] real do you can't make it up right it
[1:03:10] was oh it's Mel ches it's it's this it's
[1:03:12] that
[1:03:15] well they've even believed it was
[1:03:17] William
[1:03:19] Brown right in this message yeah right
[1:03:23] believe it was William Brown
[1:03:28] if he does reveal a new name that's all
[1:03:30] right but I want to stay with a name
[1:03:31] that refers to our righteousness
[1:03:37] amen our
[1:03:39] righteousness which is in Christ Jesus
[1:03:42] all right now let's go one more while we
[1:03:44] here we just spend the rest of the
[1:03:46] service on this go to Psalms a lot of
[1:03:49] you know where I'll be heading on
[1:03:52] that Psalms 85
[1:03:56] and let's just see what happened 2,000
[1:03:59] years
[1:04:01] ago it happened in a two-fold
[1:04:05] CL it happened when he was born on earth
[1:04:10] right and it really come to reality on
[1:04:14] the River Jordan
[1:04:17] right as to talk about his
[1:04:21] name our righteousness
[1:04:25] talk about how righteous we
[1:04:29] are how righteous we are is because of
[1:04:32] what we believe right we believe God it
[1:04:36] can be imputed unto us for righteousness
[1:04:38] right we believe what God Said by the
[1:04:41] prophet we're righteous right but if we
[1:04:45] claim to believe what the prophet said
[1:04:47] and act like the
[1:04:48] devil that wouldn't be too good of
[1:04:52] righteousness so then our lives after
[1:04:54] becoming a Christian there got a lot to
[1:04:57] do with
[1:04:58] it you have anything to do with being
[1:05:00] saved except except the fact of
[1:05:02] accepting Jesus Christ that's right all
[1:05:05] right but then after you're born again
[1:05:08] your life is more meaningful than ever
[1:05:11] before amen because why wouldn't we want
[1:05:13] to be the children of God that's right
[1:05:15] why wouldn't we want to live like our
[1:05:17] father so if you're thinking about doing
[1:05:20] something the prophet said if you're
[1:05:21] thinking about doing something and
[1:05:22] something saids don't do it he said just
[1:05:24] don't do it the best
[1:05:27] way you know just don't do it that's the
[1:05:30] best
[1:05:31] way cuz if you feel condemned you not do
[1:05:33] it
[1:05:35] right but now let's think about
[1:05:39] it God came
[1:05:42] down that you and I might receive
[1:05:44] eternal life that's
[1:05:48] right God himself not another person the
[1:05:51] prophet
[1:05:53] said so for us to be righteous he said
[1:05:56] he had to make a way right he had to
[1:05:58] come himself so he didn't send a
[1:06:01] son he came himself
[1:06:04] right right cuz he just one true and
[1:06:07] living
[1:06:09] God he came himself so then what took
[1:06:13] place here in the
[1:06:19] scriptures let's just start reading in
[1:06:21] verse
[1:06:23] one
[1:06:26] Lord thou H has been favorable unto thy
[1:06:31] land thou has brought back the Captivity
[1:06:34] of Jacob that's
[1:06:36] right now I'm going surprise you a
[1:06:39] second we read these four verses so
[1:06:41] listen to
[1:06:43] them Lord thou H has been favorable unto
[1:06:47] thy
[1:06:48] land that has brought back to captivity
[1:06:51] of
[1:06:52] Jacob that has forgiven the iniquity of
[1:06:54] thy
[1:06:55] people that has covered all their sin
[1:06:59] right that's has taken away all thy
[1:07:03] wrath and has turned thyself in the
[1:07:05] fearlessness of thine
[1:07:08] anger turn us oh god of our
[1:07:12] salvation and cause thine anger toward
[1:07:15] us to
[1:07:19] cease
[1:07:22] now
[1:07:24] the psalmist
[1:07:27] David is this same
[1:07:31] dilemma that job was
[1:07:34] in you'll notice all the things he's
[1:07:37] talking about As Natural
[1:07:40] Things
[1:07:43] read all that's natural things you done
[1:07:46] this for Judah you done this you
[1:07:47] forgiven
[1:07:49] you he's looking for a
[1:07:51] savior I wrote this in my Bible probably
[1:07:54] I don't know 20 years
[1:07:56] ago he's like job he's looking for a
[1:08:04] savior we're looking for a savior right
[1:08:06] amen right we're looking for someone
[1:08:09] that can make us righteous right
[1:08:13] perfect and we realize it could only be
[1:08:15] almighty God Amen not a second person
[1:08:18] not another God not a demon god demon
[1:08:21] god is a Lesser God and that's what
[1:08:24] they're saying today that Jesus was
[1:08:26] another substance so that's a Dem of
[1:08:29] God you look up the word de of God it
[1:08:32] really means a right a Lesser
[1:08:36] God but now think about it the psalmist
[1:08:39] is saying Lord you've done all these
[1:08:41] things but I still don't see
[1:08:46] anything verse
[1:08:50] five will thou be angry with us forever
[1:08:57] will th draw out thine anger to all
[1:09:01] generations he doesn't see it does he
[1:09:04] right Willl thou not revive us again
[1:09:08] that the people may rejoice in
[1:09:12] thee show us thy mercy oh
[1:09:15] Lord and grant us thy
[1:09:21] salvation then God speaks to him and
[1:09:24] prophecy
[1:09:26] right now
[1:09:29] listen I will hear what the Lord will
[1:09:35] speak for he will speak peace unto his
[1:09:38] people and to his
[1:09:39] Saints but let them not turn again to
[1:09:43] Folly surely his salvation is not them
[1:09:46] that fear Him That Glory May dwell in
[1:09:50] our
[1:09:52] land job was looking for a
[1:09:57] savior job knew of the righteousness of
[1:10:00] God he knew of the judgments he knew of
[1:10:03] the end and all of the things but he
[1:10:05] couldn't find a
[1:10:09] savior watch
[1:10:11] you surely his salvation is not them
[1:10:14] that fear Him That glor Glory May dwell
[1:10:17] in our land mercy and Truth are met
[1:10:22] together
[1:10:24] righteousness and
[1:10:26] peace have kissed each other that's
[1:10:29] right truth shall spring out of the
[1:10:36] earth and righteousness shall look
[1:10:41] down from
[1:10:42] heaven
[1:10:44] right yeah the Lord shall give that
[1:10:47] which is good in our land shall yield
[1:10:48] our Increase righteousness shall go
[1:10:51] before him and Shall Set us in the way
[1:10:54] of his steps
[1:10:56] right job said I need a
[1:10:59] redeemer
[1:11:01] right and then it was revealed to
[1:11:04] him I know my redeemer liveth and in the
[1:11:07] last days he'll stand upon the Earth
[1:11:08] I'll see for
[1:11:10] myself what do you think that the
[1:11:13] psalmist David just said
[1:11:18] right he was needing a savior then he
[1:11:21] was doing the thing of talking about it
[1:11:23] will you be
[1:11:25] angry and he saying Lord show us your
[1:11:29] mercy and he says I'll hear what God has
[1:11:31] to
[1:11:32] say what God
[1:11:37] say God said mercy and Truth are met
[1:11:43] together righteousness and peace have
[1:11:46] kissed each
[1:11:48] other
[1:11:49] right Cru shall sprang out of the earth
[1:11:52] m
[1:11:54] truth Jesus
[1:11:57] Christ and righteousness shall look
[1:12:00] down from
[1:12:04] heaven you see when the Lord Jesus
[1:12:06] Christ was born upon the
[1:12:10] Earth righteousness and
[1:12:14] peace kissed each other amen God and man
[1:12:18] was
[1:12:22] reconciled that's right then when he
[1:12:25] came to the River Jordan it came into a
[1:12:27] deeper meaning of the same
[1:12:30] thing right brother Joe go ahead and
[1:12:31] pull him up her brother
[1:12:35] Anderson we didn't figure we'd get much
[1:12:37] further than this so we get on to number
[1:12:43] two this is taken from Paradox
[1:12:46] 1964
[1:12:51] 206b I wasn't giv him the time to do and
[1:12:55] they was waiting on
[1:12:58] me but listen what your Prophet has to
[1:13:01] say about this
[1:13:03] scripture look what he
[1:13:06] says when Jesus was standing there he's
[1:13:09] talking about how the Virgin birth with
[1:13:11] a paradox the Virgin conceive bring
[1:13:14] forth a child of God make flesh God
[1:13:16] changed his strand from Spirit to become
[1:13:19] man man changed he changed his tent his
[1:13:22] Dwelling Place in
[1:13:25] Tabernacle when Jesus was standing there
[1:13:27] and upon the shores of Galilee John
[1:13:30] looked up and he saw the spirit of God
[1:13:32] like a dove descending in a voice saying
[1:13:35] this is my beloved Son whom I pleased to
[1:13:37] dwell in and whom I pleased to dwell in
[1:13:41] to pleased to dwell the same thing verb
[1:13:44] before the adverb is all Seas this is my
[1:13:47] beloved Son in whom I am pleased to
[1:13:48] dwell in God and man became
[1:13:52] one
[1:13:55] God and man becoming one uniting
[1:13:57] together for
[1:13:59] Redemption how God that covered all
[1:14:02] space and time could come down and
[1:14:04] bottle himself into a man so he could
[1:14:07] taste death for all the human race the
[1:14:11] Creator dying to save his creation
[1:14:13] amen heavens and earth kissed each other
[1:14:17] man and God became
[1:14:19] one how can a man there he might dwell
[1:14:24] in man that he might dwell in man and
[1:14:27] fellowship is nothing but God
[1:14:29] condescending trying to get to his man
[1:14:31] that's right so Heaven and Earth kissed
[1:14:34] each
[1:14:36] other righteousness and peace you notice
[1:14:40] truth Springs out where did Jesus Christ
[1:14:43] come from
[1:14:45] right he came up out of the Earth the
[1:14:49] body all right righteousness looks down
[1:14:52] all right what happens on the River
[1:14:53] Jordan This is my beloved Son in whom
[1:14:55] I'm pleased to dwell what does he say in
[1:14:57] the future home Liv right this is my
[1:14:59] part of the earth that I have redeemed
[1:15:00] for this part of the earth I'll redeem
[1:15:02] the rest go ahead and pull up the next
[1:15:03] one questions and answers number two
[1:15:06] 1964 8:23 the evening
[1:15:12] service when man was made in the image
[1:15:15] of God then God came down in the image
[1:15:18] of man to redeem man that brought man
[1:15:22] and God together
[1:15:24] heavens and earth hugged and kissed each
[1:15:26] other God and man embraced each other as
[1:15:30] fatherhood and sunship when the Lost
[1:15:33] became flesh and dwelt Among
[1:15:37] Us that's what happened in the psalmist
[1:15:40] the psalmist saw the
[1:15:42] Redeemer right he saw heaven and earth
[1:15:45] kissing each
[1:15:47] other okay look at the next
[1:15:51] one the lamb and the the
[1:15:54] dove pre
[1:15:56] 1957 uh
[1:15:58] 3:25 when this Dove came from the
[1:16:00] heavens the meest bird of all the
[1:16:02] heavens came to the meekest animal on
[1:16:05] all the Earth Heaven and Earth kissed
[1:16:07] each other Heaven and Earth was United
[1:16:10] together man and God was reconciled in
[1:16:13] one body the Lord Jesus Christ certainly
[1:16:16] was it was the god of Heaven in the form
[1:16:19] of a dove the Son of God in the form of
[1:16:21] the Lamb right the righteousness and
[1:16:25] peace has kissed each other in Jesus
[1:16:28] Christ right both on the River Jordan
[1:16:31] and his new his birth yeah look at this

[1:16:47] this world has ever seen and will

[1:17:37] Heaven and Earth embraced each other and
[1:17:39] kissed each other and settled a sin
[1:17:42] question forever is when the Dove and
[1:17:44] the lamb United together one of the
[1:17:47] greatest that's when the price when the
[1:17:50] greatest reconciliation that was ever
[1:17:52] made it's when God and Christ United as

[1:18:20] the earth you shall know the truth and
[1:18:21] the truth shall make you free
[1:18:24] this message is the Bible truth
[1:18:28] right and as we become one with it
[1:18:31] righteousness is coming down from heaven
[1:18:34] that's
[1:18:36] right that's what that's why I'm not
[1:18:38] looking for the coming of the Lord up
[1:18:43] there right I've been looking at the
[1:18:46] coming of the Lord for a long time
[1:18:49] right but I thought your Prophet said to
[1:18:51] coming of the Lord was revealing of the
[1:18:53] of his word
[1:18:54] amen I mean that's what I thought he
[1:18:56] said that's right the revealing of his
[1:18:59] word where's he revealing in
[1:19:03] you Heaven and Earth is kissing
[1:19:09] again you're on Earth yes right when
[1:19:13] that word is revealed into your
[1:19:16] heart truth has sprung up right
[1:19:21] amen but righteous will be made known
[1:19:24] yes
[1:19:27] right now I ask you a simple
[1:19:32] question outside of the end time word
[1:19:34] did we know anything about how to be
[1:19:38] righteous right without this message to
[1:19:42] reveal it to us right we pondered our
[1:19:45] thoughts that's right we
[1:19:51] guessed we we would take things you know
[1:19:54] like and have no more conscience of sin
[1:19:58] well well we interpret this and then we
[1:20:01] interpret
[1:20:05] that instead of seeing what God wanted
[1:20:08] us to see
[1:20:09] right he is righteousness you said well
[1:20:13] brother D I've always believed that he
[1:20:14] gave me
[1:20:18] salvation but if you'll be honest with
[1:20:21] yourself until you heard of the message
[1:20:23] of the
[1:20:24] hour and I'll even come down a little
[1:20:26] further until you heard more into the
[1:20:30] where we're at now you don't like that
[1:20:33] stick in your hat and puff it I don't
[1:20:39] care because where is it preached around
[1:20:41] the
[1:20:44] message oh we're not in them little
[1:20:46] simple things we're here at this great
[1:20:50] headstone oh we just see there all these
[1:20:53] Lords and souls
[1:20:55] and
[1:20:59] yeah there stood a man on earth a little
[1:21:02] simple honest little
[1:21:05] man to fulfill the
[1:21:07] Bible that heaven and
[1:21:10] Earth would kiss each
[1:21:16] other what about it you and I right
[1:21:21] right true truth will spring up out of
[1:21:23] the
[1:21:25] earth
[1:21:27] amen was not it a man that brought us
[1:21:29] this message that's right man is it not
[1:21:33] that we depend upon the fact
[1:21:35] that the man brought us a message that's
[1:21:38] right right and you know what it's like
[1:21:41] we're talking about this morning where
[1:21:43] Abraham believed
[1:21:46] God now they're making a lot of
[1:21:48] statements today that brother brandham
[1:21:50] was wrong here and wrong there and up
[1:21:52] did this wrong that wrong
[1:21:56] y well I'm going to make my
[1:22:01] statement if he was
[1:22:07] wrong he brought me to Christ that's not
[1:22:11] right so then I don't believe he's
[1:22:14] wrong it's all
[1:22:16] problem I just like to make people
[1:22:19] think he brought me to Christ
[1:22:24] I thank God for everybody that's ever
[1:22:26] tried to help me right when I was in the
[1:22:29] Baptist Church I thank them for trying
[1:22:31] to help me right I did
[1:22:34] sure I thank the preachers and the
[1:22:37] things for trying to help
[1:22:40] me I came in message I had to leave
[1:22:43] churches couple of you know what I done
[1:22:46] before I left I thank
[1:22:48] them for helping
[1:22:51] me I still quote a lot what they
[1:22:55] say cuz it was true I thank them for
[1:22:58] helping
[1:23:03] me because the truth is what I want amen
[1:23:07] if it's a dumb
[1:23:10] donkey I want the truth
[1:23:13] right I ain't listening to him why
[1:23:18] not why
[1:23:21] not
[1:23:25] you
[1:23:29] see if we are just as righteous as God
[1:23:34] is then he's going to keep us from
[1:23:36] following or falling into the wrong
[1:23:39] thing right he's always done that's
[1:23:44] right right he's always guided us to the
[1:23:49] truth so
[1:23:51] evidently
[1:23:53] mercy and Truth is raised up
[1:23:57] right but
[1:23:59] righteousness looks down from
[1:24:03] heaven comes down to reveal itself upon
[1:24:06] Earth in a
[1:24:11] bride that believes she's perfect right
[1:24:16] right believe she's
[1:24:18] righteous because he said it right if he
[1:24:22] said it let me say it you
[1:24:31] know you say no no no I don't know where
[1:24:35] it's talking about me or not well who
[1:24:36] else is it talking about right why can't
[1:24:39] I believe behold I seen you Elijah amen
[1:24:44] why can't I believe that's for me
[1:24:47] amen I canot believe what this prophet's
[1:24:50] message is the truth right right that
[1:24:53] rose up out of the
[1:24:55] earth and went across the world right
[1:24:58] and amazing for me to read in 64 and go
[1:25:01] back and hear a tape in 57 and hear what
[1:25:04] is saying right that's
[1:25:08] right righteousness and peace has kissed
[1:25:12] each other amen let's stand come
[1:25:15] on thank on these
[1:25:17] things we got to have a communion right
[1:25:20] I'm forget okay
[1:25:27] nobody has to keep me
[1:25:31] straight let's turn in our
[1:25:39] scriptures read our scriptures and think
[1:25:41] about it yes who of any of us would be
[1:25:44] even worthy to take the
[1:25:48] communion where it be anything in any of
[1:25:50] us it would be even the thoughts of
[1:25:52] that's right being
[1:25:54] worthy but he made us
[1:25:57] worthy so before we go into the
[1:25:59] communion let's have a few
[1:26:02] minutes and just think about
[1:26:05] ourselves and ask God to make us
[1:26:11] worthy just to make us worthy yes to
[1:26:14] take the communion cuz if we don't see
[1:26:16] we drank dation dur our ownselves that's
[1:26:18] right right
[1:26:19] am that's why the Bible say it as many
[1:26:22] weak and sickly among you when he
[1:26:26] sleep why that's right cuz they never
[1:26:29] considered whether they was worthy or
[1:26:30] not they always thought they
[1:26:33] was well you know if the question was
[1:26:35] asked here today how many of us in here
[1:26:37] are worthy to take the communion I
[1:26:39] wouldn't raise my
[1:26:41] hand as to think I was
[1:26:46] worthy you wouldn't
[1:26:49] no but if I believe what he said say
[1:26:52] about me
[1:26:54] right thank you Lord then he's made me
[1:26:57] worthy he's made me righteous he's made
[1:26:59] me true he's made me
[1:27:01] perfect so I got to believe what he says
[1:27:04] then I depend on that right that's right
[1:27:07] do anything any need to get them out of
[1:27:09] the way that's the best thing to do
[1:27:11] that's right get them out of the way
[1:27:14] okay 1 Corinthians 11 chapter verse 23
[1:27:17] for have received of the Lord that which
[1:27:19] also I delivered unto you that the Lord
[1:27:20] Jesus the same night in which he was
[1:27:22] betrayed took bread and when he had
[1:27:24] given thanks he broke it and said take
[1:27:26] eat this is my
[1:27:28] body which is broken for you this doing
[1:27:30] remembrance of me after the same manner
[1:27:33] also he took the cup when he had s
[1:27:34] saying this cup is the New Testament in
[1:27:36] my blood this do ye as often as you
[1:27:39] drink it in remembrance of me for as
[1:27:42] often as you eat this bread and drink
[1:27:43] this cup with the cup you do sh the
[1:27:45] Lord's death till he come wherefore
[1:27:48] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[1:27:50] this cup of the Lord unworthy shall be
[1:27:53] guilty of the body and blood of the Lord
[1:27:55] but let a man examine himself and so let
[1:27:57] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[1:27:58] cup for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:28:00] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[1:28:02] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[1:28:05] body but this CA many are weak and
[1:28:07] sickly among you and many
[1:28:09] sleep for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:28:12] should not be judged now here's one I
[1:28:14] like but when we are
[1:28:17] judged we are chastened of the Lord that
[1:28:21] we should not be de with the world
[1:28:23] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:28:25] together to eat t one for another and if
[1:28:28] any man hunger let him meet at home that
[1:28:30] you come not together under condemnation
[1:28:32] and the rest I would set in order when I
[1:28:34] come so let's just have a few moments of
[1:28:37] Silent prayer praying one for the other
[1:28:40] praying the Lord would make us worthy
[1:28:51] right
[1:28:54] Just Have Your Way Lord with each and
[1:28:55] every one of us forgive us our of our
[1:28:58] sins because when we stand with our sins
[1:29:01] forgiven then we're Worthy is what you
[1:29:04] made
[1:29:05] us we didn't make
[1:29:09] ourselves we're just resting upon what
[1:29:11] you say we love you and we thank
[1:29:15] you just cleanse us all from all
[1:29:18] unrighteousness cuz Lord we know that
[1:29:20] within us as human Mortals is no good
[1:29:22] thing that's right but yet in you is all
[1:29:28] things have your way in Jesus
[1:29:34] name Bible said he took bread and
[1:29:37] blessed it father we thank you for this
[1:29:39] bread it's been made for this purpose
[1:29:41] today we ask you to sanctify it and Lord
[1:29:45] we know that it represents thy body
[1:29:48] which was shed for each and every one of
[1:29:50] us it represents the word word that made
[1:29:52] that body so as we break the bread as we
[1:29:57] partake you come in each one of us and
[1:30:00] be what we have need
[1:30:02] of forgive our sins cleanse us from all
[1:30:06] unrighteousness guide us in Jesus name
[1:30:20] amen it was broken body it wouldn't
[1:30:23] just that's right it wouldn't that he
[1:30:26] just they just took him up there and
[1:30:27] crucified him they beat him broke him
[1:30:30] everything it could be thought
[1:30:34] of look like a piece of hamburger
[1:30:37] meat no Beauty the Bible says that we
[1:30:40] should desire
[1:30:43] him what about
[1:30:45] that you know
[1:30:47] what he done that for me and
[1:30:50] you he paid the price
[1:30:52] Christ that we could be just as
[1:30:55] righteous as he
[1:30:57] is if we can believe
[1:30:59] it Lord Jesus we thank you for this wine
[1:31:03] it's went through the processes of Aging
[1:31:05] Lord better each day then it represents
[1:31:08] thy blood that was shed for us your
[1:31:11] life that we could live so now sanctify
[1:31:15] the wine and the partakers that we may
[1:31:18] all be together as one in you we love
[1:31:20] you and we thank you in Jesus name
[1:31:25] amen
[1:31:28] hallu
[1:31:36] Hall I know it was the
[1:31:39] blood I know it was the
[1:31:43] blood I know it was the blood for
[1:31:48] me one day when I was
[1:31:53] he died upon the cross and I know it was
[1:31:58] the
[1:32:01] blood it was Emmanuel's
[1:32:05] blood was Emmanuel's blood it was
[1:32:09] Emmanuel's blood for
[1:32:13] me one day when I was lost he died upon
[1:32:19] the cross and I know it was the blood
[1:32:25] for I know it was the
[1:32:29] blood know it the blood I know it was
[1:32:34] the blood for
[1:32:38] me one day when I
[1:32:41] was he died upon the cross and I know
[1:32:47] was
[1:32:49] for like of all the times that communion
[1:32:52] has been
[1:32:54] taken and all of them still meaning and
[1:32:56] speaking of a time yes and we get there
[1:32:59] the marriage supper is going to be the
[1:33:02] communion that's where we'll take the
[1:33:04] communion we'll really realize
[1:33:06] realization then that's
[1:33:08] right because that'll be what we'll
[1:33:11] understand that's right we'll understand
[1:33:13] then what it really
[1:33:16] means and then why would it be if it
[1:33:19] wasn't there something Supernatural in
[1:33:21] the
[1:33:22] line why would it not be some of the
[1:33:25] disciples that expressed the
[1:33:29] communion you never thought of that I'm
[1:33:31] talking about some like Matthew Mark
[1:33:33] Luke John the writers the Peter the
[1:33:38] ones but they wasn't
[1:33:41] chosen Paul was chosen to tell us about
[1:33:45] the
[1:33:47] communion because he had the greatest
[1:33:49] knowledge of the Old Testament forms
[1:33:52] of the
[1:33:54] Passover the lamb the
[1:33:57] things that's right like Wade was
[1:33:59] preaching there years ago about it you
[1:34:01] know how that that there was a time in
[1:34:03] there that there was a part about the
[1:34:07] break into the bread the things that was
[1:34:10] in there included in it but not
[1:34:12] emphasized so much
[1:34:14] maybe until we wouldn't think about it
[1:34:17] right but see Paul understood
[1:34:20] that
[1:34:22] Paul had a good understanding
[1:34:25] right never even seeing the Lord never
[1:34:28] walking with
[1:34:30] him probably heard of him in
[1:34:33] life maybe he might have been off at
[1:34:36] school at the time you
[1:34:38] know but one day he became a
[1:34:42] Christian yes Lord and God said I need
[1:34:45] somebody to explain this
[1:34:49] communion Paul just start to say sits
[1:34:51] down and he writes to the
[1:34:54] Corinthians and he explains it first off
[1:34:57] because the Corinthians were getting
[1:34:59] together and just they knew about the
[1:35:00] communion but they were just eating
[1:35:02] meals and just doing everything you know
[1:35:03] just having a whole hoook
[1:35:06] lock it wouldn't sincere right and Paul
[1:35:10] sat down and wrote
[1:35:11] him and the Lord just directed his
[1:35:14] thought right down the line of what it
[1:35:15] all is
[1:35:17] about but talk about the
[1:35:20] communion to see what it really
[1:35:24] means think on these things cuz it's not
[1:35:27] just something we do once a month that's
[1:35:29] right or we have a time to do or
[1:35:30] whatever it's not that that's
[1:35:36] right it's the real sincerity of the
[1:35:45] heart let's all protect
[1:35:50] again
[1:35:59] you can be seated for a moment while we
[1:36:02] get through and read the scriptures and
[1:36:03] the foot
[1:36:05] washing
[1:36:07] just think on these things
[1:36:11] John verse
[1:36:13] 13 and supper being ended the devil
[1:36:15] having now put into the heart of Judas
[1:36:16] is carar Simon son to betray him Jesus
[1:36:19] knowing that the father had given all
[1:36:21] things into his hands that he come from
[1:36:22] God and went to
[1:36:24] God he rised from supper and laid aside
[1:36:26] his garments and took a towel and GED
[1:36:28] himself after that he poured water into
[1:36:30] a basin be to wash the disciples feet
[1:36:32] and to wipe them with the towel where
[1:36:34] with he was GED then cometh he to Simon
[1:36:36] Peter and Peter said unto him Lord Dost
[1:36:38] thou wash my feet Jesus answered and
[1:36:41] said unto him what I do thou knowest not
[1:36:43] now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter
[1:36:46] said unto him Thou shalt never wash my
[1:36:48] feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee
[1:36:51] not thou Hast no part with me Simon
[1:36:53] Peter said unto him Lord not my feet
[1:36:56] only but my but also my hands in my head
[1:36:59] that's right Jesus said unto him he that
[1:37:01] is washed neth not saved to wash his
[1:37:04] feet but is clean ever with and you are
[1:37:06] clean but not all for he knew who should
[1:37:09] betray him therefore said he you're not
[1:37:11] all clean so after he had washed their
[1:37:14] feet and had taken his garments and was
[1:37:16] set down again he said unto them know
[1:37:18] you what I have done to you you call me
[1:37:22] master and Lord and you say well for so
[1:37:24] I am if I then your Lord and Master have
[1:37:26] washed your feet you also ought to wash
[1:37:29] one another's feet for I have given you
[1:37:31] an example that you should do as I have
[1:37:32] done to you verely verely I say unto you
[1:37:35] the servant is not greater than his Lord
[1:37:37] neither he that is sent greater than he
[1:37:39] that sent him if you know these things
[1:37:42] happy are ye if you do that let's Stand
[1:37:47] Together our heavenly father we thank
[1:37:49] you for this day for your love and guide
[1:37:51] us unto us thank you for Thy word thank
[1:37:54] you for the truth that Lord surely can
[1:37:57] raise up out of the earth and
[1:37:59] righteousness can look down from heaven
[1:38:01] and there'll be a kissing of each other
[1:38:04] Lord when we become one with you we love
[1:38:06] you and we thank you now as we go to
[1:38:09] this last part of the foot washing we
[1:38:11] pray that you'd bless be with each one
[1:38:13] and Bless the people on the way home
[1:38:15] give a safe journey and let your light
[1:38:17] shine in Jesus name amen you're
