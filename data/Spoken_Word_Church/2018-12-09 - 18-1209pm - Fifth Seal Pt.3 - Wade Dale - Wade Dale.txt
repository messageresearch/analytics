«  22       †          And it helped me, because I used to have an idea: when a person died, just their soul went off. But then when He quoted that to me, that "If this earthly tabernacle of our habitation be... we already have one." See? And we got to have everything in threes, to make a perfection. See? And there's one body here, then that body there which is the--the celestial body, and then the glorified body in the resurrection. See, that makes it complete. See? So it's a... It's not a myth, it's not an idea, it's not a spirit. It is a man and a woman like you are, just exactly.

«  23       †          And then, years ago, I seen the regions of the lost, and was there. I tell you, friend, as an old man, let me persuade you this, across the nation this morning, don't never want to view that place. There's no way at all that I could... if I was an artist with a brush I couldn't paint the picture. As a minister, I couldn't describe to you. Talk about hell being a burning place, it's a million times worse than that, the horrors that goes with it.

«  24       †          And Heaven... or this place, wherever it was, I don't know what to call it. He referred to it there as "souls under the altar." But when it was, I have never... There's no way to explain how great that is. There is... Now, you just have to take my word, I'm just a man. See? But these visions that's always come to pass just as I have told you, and you know they every one has been true, that is true also. Whatever you do, if you miss everything else (health, strength, your eyesight, whatever it is), don't miss That. There's nothing can compare with it. It's... There's no--there's no word in the English language, that I know, that could express it. If you'd say "perfect," it's beyond that; "superb," it--it's beyond that; "sublime,"... There's no--there's no words that I know that could express it, because it was so... A...
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we'd be able to at least get one service in so i think that's been that's been given to us and i know you're praying too i i hope you weren't sitting there praying we get six inches of snow on the ground can't come to church but that's all right and some of you that are listening in are watching then good to have you with us today and in the very comfort of ease of your home just put your feet up and pay attention revelations six let's go to verse nine and we'll talk about the fifth seal again this will be part three uh remember next sunday we'll only be having one service um our sunday schools will be at 9 45 we're going to make sure and do our sunday school gift exchange hurriedly and so they can do the christmas program so all of us that have sunday school classes try to be done by 10 o'clock and and up here by 10 o'clock and or let the children go wherever they need to go so be real short abbreviated sunday school class but it'll just be for exchanging the gifts and and stuff like that so also remember next luis when you're leaving 14th friday remember circle that on your calendar brother louise sister christine and the girls are all going to honduras so remember them on their travels they'll be here wednesday night but also i'd like to uh say if you have something extra to give them uh he'll be out of work i mean it just costs money to go overseas it doesn't matter what so if you got a little extra to give him just hand it to him and or you can either write a check and lisa can give it to him she's nodding her head back there so you you can do that also but it's always good to have a little traveling money in your pocket like daddy always says he he calls it his rat hole he's got a couple of couple of dead presidents wrapped up under in his billfold somewhere all the time sophia and we've needed it there's been times we've been places we needed that rat hole money so it's always good to have a little extra but uh uh hey you can't put money on a soul you can't put money on us all and if he can go over there and just just one soul receive something then uh all the money in the world can't buy that so we pray that brother luis will have a wonderful time he he's uh doing a good job with those hispanic brothers and and being able to speak their language there's no language barrier there so he's able to uh boy i really enjoyed that wednesday night i i'd like to have that brother back and sit down and talk to him for a few few weeks you know and get to know him a little bit better but you know what if we don't hear we know for an eternity we'll be able to sit down and talk and reminisce about what happened down here and there won't be any language barrier you know what he'll hear me in my english i mean he'll hear me in spanish and i'll hear him in english it's not gonna be any language barrier there so oh you think we all going to speak english when we get over there no they're going to speak their native language that's the way they were raised but you're going to hear it in your tongue that's what happened on the day of pentecost right it's what happened showing that that's what's going to happen in the future home is everybody's going to hear them in their own native language whether they may be speaking hispanic or what more but you're hearing it in your there'll be no language barrier there so we thank god for that thank god for a prophet they brought us these little tidbits and on what's gonna happen like we were talking about hearing that last sunday about going across the curtain of time and you know paul wrote briefly about it but brother branham come back and he kept telling us about it kept telling us about going across because paul says you know i don't know whether i was caught up here there saw things i couldn't talk about well brother branham went across and come back and he talked about a lot that went on that made up a lot of a lot of things that went on helped him a lot and we'll read them again this afternoon to get a a little more of a background and then we're going to talk today about the seal the seal itself the fifth seal you know we always wrap up the little wrap up the little paper and put the seal on it well the sea the fifth seal is what we're fixing to read here and then we're going to just give you that overview today then we're going to dig into i believe is the thunder behind the seal maybe next not next sunday but maybe the sunday after that because we'll have just one service next week so revelation 6 verse 9 let's bow our heads before we get started dear lord thank you for this day thank you for this time of of just sitting under the anointing of the holy ghost everybody brought their lick of fire everybody coming under expectation so lord we're just going to receive something from me because you said where two or three are gathered in your name you will be in the midst and we lord believe that you've sent us a message in this hour and this message is to be as the brother said wednesday night the final voice to the final age has to come through a living a living message a living ministry not dead letter lord we pray today that you'll open back lord our eyes and give us revelation use the eye salve lord of the holy ghost to break back the scales just for a few minutes and not worry about the conditions outside and all the things that's going to go on next week lord but let's just for a few minutes enter into eternity and just watch you do your work father forgive us of our sins be with the ones that are sick be with the missionaries on the foreign field to give them fruit for their labor father we ask that you just take care of us be with brother luis as he travels and the family lord just bless them give them fruit for their labor father we ask all these things in the name of jesus christ amen revelation 6 9 and when he had opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of god and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long o lord holy and true thus thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth they asked them a question and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servant also and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled you may be seated in the lord as blessing we're going to try to dramatize this a little bit maybe after we give a uh give a little overview from last sunday if that's okay i mean it's not going to get dark till five o'clock so we okay all right brother joe yeah thank you buddy but we're there we go so we've been talking about starting on the fifth steel this is part three and we saw last sunday where that seal number one was the white horse rider seal number two the red horse rider number three the black horse rider seal number four we went through all that and remember we're caught up on the for sale that all right say amen amen so on the fourth seal that is and keep this in your mind that's the total of the gentile dispensation okay because it's the seven church ages and we'll just you know from here to here we'll go two three four five six seven that's that's all we're allotted is seven church ages the gentiles right and we were given the holy ghost on the day of pentecost to lead us through those seven church ages under revelation of the son of god all right this is all background under the revelation of the son of god believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved and as many as were added they were added daily people were baptized in the name of jesus christ and god anointed seven men seven church age messengers to bring that message that all right and it was the four horse riders that went riding out in opposition to the four beasts or combat beasts that are the lion ox man and eagle and then we know the lion was here the ox here the man age here and then you and i are in the eagle age so we're in the age of flight we're in the age of leaving the ground right here sure a lion can jump you know an ox can't jump very high uh man can artificially do things but he still can't fly like an eagle he can't just stand right here and take off and fly across the grand canyon we were there last year and and man what a spectacle the grand canyon you just can't describe it in pictures and anything any words but you know what you stand right on the edge brother john and you want that big rail around you hey man that big rail i don't want some little bitty pencil thing that i you know around the edge why because i can't fly but a bird just comes and sits right there on the on the rock beside you and he sees his friend out there in the middle of the grand canyon you know what he doesn't look around and go well i let me make sure that i'm prayed up and make sure no he just goes and man he just sails out through there and you know what brother larry it doesn't matter if it's 10 miles deep or a mile deep it doesn't matter to him he's just looking down going man this is good well that's the way you and i are supposed to be that's why i told you that we have when we come into this fifth seal it's got to be in a supernatural realm and and we'll get talk about something in just a minute um that may help us on that but uh i knew when we started and i'm going to start doing this i'm going to start when when i get a an unction i'm going to start writing it down and put it in an envelope sealing it and putting it up somewhere and let you read it after that happens because i knew we would have a big distraction when we started the fifth seal i knew it i could have wrote it down and on a piece of paper sealed it up and put it in an envelope and put it in a safe and you could have read it right because a lot of you are are are having a problem with the the altar call thing and the prayer line thing and you know that's just something you're gonna have to get over right because i got some quotes in here this really will stir your water brother brown says i do not believe in altar calls never have believed in altar call he said it's not ever been in the bible but see now when you start thinking that you go oh see you everybody clicks their computer off like brother dale said you click a computer off you say well you're just wrong really i'm just reading you what the prophet said i'm just telling you what he's fixing to tell you in a few minutes under the anointing of the holy ghost he says i don't believe in altar calls but see i knew that would be a distraction i knew that would come a distraction i just didn't know how so there you go there's the distraction everybody is not everybody but a lot of people you can you know you can say what you want to but we're going to have to have a different thought process to get us out of here because the thought process we're under now is not working it's not working right you know why it's not working because i still go to funerals that's right so it's not working something's not working so we got to try to find something that'll work and you know what it's not a ouija board it's not some kind of uh well we'll we'll see if go to this and go no it's already in the bible god's already told us how to act but we took tradition listen that's what's in these ages that's what i was trying to tell you next last sunday we got to get out of that tradition tradition has put look no shame in people being in the grave but you see that mark in that mark you and i are right about and you can't see it in the back because they ain't much of a wine but you and i are right there there's just like a paper white thin edge between the rapture and us they're waiting on you and i they're waiting according to hebrews 11 40 that they here's they you may write that they they without us cannot be made perfect they're missing a piece they're missing a part because what happened is their tradition put them in the ground i'm sorry their tradition is what put them in the ground right but the son of man revelation is not going to put us in the ground it's going to take us up you think when jesus walked up to the pharisees like i said last week and it's going to tie in with what we're talking about today because god came to the jews first he came to his own and his own received him not now we know jesus wasn't a jew but he was born under jewry he was born under the old testament he was born in israel or bethlehem so he was born amongst his people he came to his own and his own received him not but such as did receive him them he gave eternal life why they didn't stick with the tradition of the old testament because there was no eternal life in the old testament there was no eternal life in the the torah never made one person eternal right right but when the man that wrote it come on the scene he was so different than their tradition they called him a devil he was god so you know what i i'm i'm just gonna say it if you say i'm wrong and if you say that i'm not with the tradition of the church thank god thank you you have took me out of that tradition of the old church maybe somebody is going to see a revelation they've never seen before right and you know what people are going to talk about you that's okay they called him belgium brother brown said he said they called him belgian bubby so what about you because they called brother brown of the devil why here he goes under the tradition of the pentecostals they accepted him until he started preaching the word against their what not the bible against their tradition brother branham was bringing the word word by word by word and they turned him down for that right not anything else he was accepted for the healing he was accepting for and he made altar calls and i'll read you in a few minutes he said i made them and i'll probably still make them he said but it is not according to the bible not according to the bible okay it's not there's not one article in the bible right there's not one prayer line in the bible not one what is it it's a tradition that we put in right the method is put off to cause reason i'm telling you this because when we say and read that scripture their souls unto the altar crying how long every one of you thought about this did you not what else did you think about this is not the altar he's talking about there never was an altar in the old testament or either in the new testament yeah there was a a box that was called the holy of holies that was the altar but that was a box this thing right over here that thing right but that wasn't an altar that anybody went and prayed to no no they believed the bible says brother brown said yeah in the new testament the bible says they believed and many were added as many as believed were added to the church not an altar call but when you say souls under the altar crying how long it's like they're here and they're crying but i'll read you in just a minute when we get into this that that's not the altar does not mean that there's only one place to meet christ and that's at calvary man has made it a tradition of the altar with the cross and you coming to the altar but the altar has always been in your heart always been in your heart he's always wanted to get to this altar not this one that's why i said this one makes you weak because you depend on this one not this one you gotta depend on this altar the altar of your heart is more important than any brick mortar would or whatever you want to make it's going to help us get out of here because if we don't build our faith up how are we going to have faith enough for a body change right amen i'm just saying but remember when we come to this fifth seal it's out of the church ages aren't we supposed to be called out of the church age right we're supposed to be called out there's no fifth seal under the church age there's not even a literal fifth seal under the church agent it's it's in another dimension right it's not covered by a line of man and eagle it's not covered by ryreneus martin club and all those sure those people were underneath there but when we get to this place that we're going to talk about this bar their souls here under the altar crying how long they're not under the altar of paul irenaeus do you understand what i mean these are not christian people in the fifth seal that's not christian people never has been never will be right what robes were given them given them that didn't make them christians they christians are live people that has christ living in them in this dimension they were christians at antioch they were christians at spoken word church because we have what christ in us the hope of glory this group here did not have that now according to what i read you last sunday brother branham thought that was the souls of these church age people under the altar of god i read you i'm gonna read it to you again just to make sure because watch let's read let's go to number two guys just to skip through this because see the mystery we're going to talk about the mystery of the seal not what's underneath but the whole mystery of the seal fifth steel brother ram said well now i get started on them subjects we're just talking to people around the wall standing so i'll get right straight to the message now i want to give thanks to him who's on the present now look remember brother branham's thought process look at me was in this direction right here that was the souls of christian people under the altar of sacrifice waiting on the re on the resurrection crying how long you see my hand that's not true according to that so why are we still doing this because brother brown said now i want to give thanks to him who's on the prison that's why brother bryan said i've never worked in a realm like this before not healings not anything but what god pulling him toward the correct revelation of the word and it stays that way brother louise you know what it never changed it never changed in the bible that's always been there where did it change in the thought process of the prophet right and then in changing the thought process of the prophet it changed our thought process that's when the seal opens and becomes personal to you it was personal to him but look at us now 50 something years later it's personal to you it's personal to me it should be personal to all of us and that today not knowing one thing about that fifth seal it came in that same mysterious way this morning just an hour before daylight when i was out in prayer now let's go to number three excuse me let's just skip to all that why isn't there one here he's talking about here going up to the next paragraph right there we know he's talking about the horse riders are gone everybody oh you know all the horse riders are done so in other words the church ages at that time has to be over okay we've already took a we've already took a rapture we revelations 4 1 we have went up through the door open door then god starts dealing with the jews well see he's he's dealing with the jews because that's what these people are these are not christians right these are jews is that all right and we we the reason there's no one there now we know written because some some reason for something now you remember at the first beginning i said there can't be nothing without a reason remember the little drop of ink now you got to find the reason there was some reason they didn't have to have a beast or a power announced this seal being broke and only god can reveal why because it always in him but the reason that he reveals that i under as i understand that it is because the mystery of the book of redemption as far as the antichrist being revealed and at the same time the church is gone these things don't even happen in the church age at all so we got to see in another dimension we got to change our thought pray what is he doing he's he's changed his thought process all six five days so far first seal he said i was thinking this way and it was totally different second seal i was thinking this way totally different third seal fourth seal fifth seal it all was the same way god was turning brother branham's thought process to just like he said he said you can't change the bible you can't add the seals didn't add the bible it was already written in there it just had to be brought out by a prophet that only only heard from god so buddy i'm telling you it's the line that comes straight from i mean it wasn't hearsay remember what i said about hearsay it wasn't hearsay when that angel came into that room on every morning of those seals and revealed that seal that was god telling the prophet this is what it is and at the same time the church is gone and these things don't even happen in the church age at all that's right they're away from the church age the church absolutely is raptured at this time the church goes up in the fourth chapter of revelation and it does not come back return until it comes back with king in the 19th chapter but these seals here are revealing what has been what is and what will be and now what was to be for the church age was revealed by these seals and now watch what takes place the four stages of his rider has been revealed the four stages of the antichrist has been revealed at this time therefore they don't have to have any more and there's four living creatures announced the riders as they rode four beasts or force powers is that all right now number four here's where brother brown now this is paragraph 215 he's getting into the seal now notice in the ninth ninth verse souls under the altar now here's where i'm going to get some real disagreement but watch just for a minute i thought that too look at me i thought that too that was his thought process right remember he thought me and brother neville can talk to each other but we can't touch each other right but was it that way was it that way at all it was that way totally different he's thinking they're christian souls under the altar and they're souls that are given eternal life that didn't even know jesus christ when they were alive amen amen white horse rider was the holy ghost brother branham no brother brown it was the antichrist that's that way okay so why are we still butting heads this way we gotta turn and go isn't that what repent is turn somebody said one time you gotta turn 360 degrees when you repent i said wait a minute it puts you right back in the same place you're that 180. he meant 180 but he said 360. you got to make a 360. no it's a 180. i thought that too but it didn't come that way i've always thought that these souls under the altar were the martyrs of the early church and i'm sure that dr uriah smith and every one of them says it is see but i thought so myself but when the holy spirit showed the vision to it it wasn't it isn't the souls now you say well i don't know about that well now in just a minute we'll find out these are not the souls of the bride church not at all we thought that was the bride church waiting there souls under the altar crying how long lord how long he thought it was the church age people that had died the bride he said bride he thought it was bride it ain't even close to bride right amen right it's people give an eternal life that don't even didn't even profess jesus on the face of the earth that's why you're going to see that's the greatest show of grace is to give somebody eternal life that didn't even want it didn't even know where that eternal life came from you and i know where eternal life comes from because you and i are possessors of it now we don't have to think wondering anything else it's here now you have your white robe today the day you got born again god put a white robe on you and you don't lose it right let me read it again so we get it right and then he reads the let's just save time come on up to here bring it up see the word of god now let's look at this for they at this time if you notice this fifth seal being open the church is gone so see when the church is gone if you have like in this in the sixth dimension where brother branham went right and they called that souls under the altar but i'm going to read you what the altar is the altar is the cross there is no physical altar that they're sitting there under an altar no they're under the altar of that sacrifice that perpetuation i'll read it to you man it's a word i can't hardly pronounce but it means the one that made the atonement they're actually looking to that atonement they're not looking at a wooden altar that's what our problem is when we say altar what's the first thing we think of right here no right here a flesh altar the altar of sacrifice because jesus gave his flesh he gave his life that's the altar right well that's in other words that's the altar i want to be connected to i won't be connected to christ so see you've got the souls here under the altar in that sixth dimension you've got millions upon millions upon millions right now when the church takes a rapture what happens they leave right don't need redemption anymore redemption's over remember the book of redemption is done when he takes that book the last one comes in the redemption for the gentiles is over so all them souls come out of that sixth dimension into this dimension get their flesh bodies again glorified you and i that have had something to do with the resurrection we get a glorified body and we just step over into another dimension if you want to say we go back in the sixth dimension that's fine because that's a good safe place to be well god wipes the rest of this off right but it has nothing to do with this this fifth seal nothing now brother branham put all of the ones that passed on in the bride under that and that was not true false that was not true this is the souls of people that had the we'll break it down it said they had the word of god you know what they had they had old testament they were jews they had the ten commandments they had we have moses right but they never knew jesus christ so they couldn't be this couldn't be the altar under the altar that the sixth seal i mean the fifth sixth dimension when brother brown went to sixth dimension it's totally two different places because this can't be in the sixth dimension folks these people are given robes the ones in the sixth dimension right now already have their robes okay that okay the church is gone it just can't be the souls under the early church now please if you ever did give this attention now because this is a great controversy so i want you to listen real close and you got your pencils to paper to write it down now these cannot be them souls because the souls of the righteous martyred and the righteous people the church the bride has done been took up amen so they wouldn't be under the altar they'd be in glory with the bride now watch for they are gone in the rapture in the fourth chapter of revelations they are taken up all right so now remember what we were talking about last sunday when this seal opens to us it has to open in a supernatural way because it's not going to open naturally to us so we need to get the thunder that's underneath that we need to get the revelation but we're going to stay with the seal first today we'll talk about the revelation later but that fifth seal is a place to hold a group of people a real special group of people how else can you say it right it's a real special group of people all right has nothing to do with christendom right in other words this can't happen though until we're gone they without us cannot be made perfect i just feel that we have something to do with this in the whole scheme of things amen i said in the whole scheme of things if that breaks to us and we see grace it's got to be graced us first where jesus christ may manifest in another form folks okay maybe we'll get in maybe we'll start believing that all right look brother brown talks in questions and answers 1953 number five now remember though let me make a point here as we as the ones that have went on across the curtain of time are in a theophany body right right but you can feel them you can hear them they can talk sure amen because brother branham i'm more regional when he went across the curtain of time he hugged him he knew they were women in other words he could feel them but there was no problem because here's the problem first three dimensions this is the problem there is no problem anywhere else okay but those people excuse me contact got out of sorts there for a minute but remember these people they were there in that sixth dimension and then when we leave that's theophanies that have come back and now have a glorified body right when that sixth dimension empties up when the resurrection happens when they come among us they're not going to be spirits they're going to be in their theophany body amen touch them hold them they'll even be able to eat jesus did when he resurrected didn't he he said give me some fish but then our bodies will be changed so everything's waiting on me and you to do something the lord doing it through us to get them into this dimension but it has nothing to do with this as far as these are not our people right but i think under all of redemption because brother mean talks about the book of redemption in the fifth seal all under redemption then they're waiting on us right amen for something to happen amen because listen if we don't see grace in its higher in its highest form you'll never see how these people make it because me and you i'm telling you if it was left up to me and you they won't make it right i'm talking about me and you humanly that one inside of me is saying hallelujah thank god there is grace for a group of people that didn't want it but if you look at us out in the world and you meet a bunch of people this is all that old messiah he was nothing that's in people in that dimension right there that's going to be given eternal life because they were a jew and they were persecuted and their daddy literally blinded their eyes right so they couldn't see see that's the to me that's the mystery glory where am i at i can't touch brother neville up there now this is in 1953 questions and answers now they know each other but they can't talk and shake hands now watch he stopped himself because they said how long how long he stopped himself right here look says they can't talk and shake hands oh i beg they could talk cause he just said they did right he couldn't deny what he just read right all right so he had to back up on that they could talk but they couldn't shake hands and so forth oh my that's the old thing we you know that's the old thing we've thought hearts harps on a on a cloud floating along you know and saying hey brother neville hey brother branham hey brother so-and-so hey brothers on something it ain't and you know what that was this thought process right here same way with you know mama's walking the streets of gold hand in hand with jesus well that's not true right we'll be true later on but right now they're in the sixth dimension they can't even see jesus if they're born again right so that must be this way that's why we have been turned that's why i told you brother random brother god through william branham went into the womb of our mind and totally turned us to the right birth he reached in and got that baby that we were he tried to turn to pentecost but they wouldn't do it but you and i he has turned us to a new way of thinking to a new thought process even the people in the message they don't even think this is important it's just something to fill in space that's important you won't get a body change without going up that statue of a perfect man you forget it that's right so i said the other sunday this message is not quote why do i have to have a verbatim quote to say that laying on hands is a tradition jesus said it was right he said i found no greater faith in israel than these gentiles who just say speak the word i don't need a quote for a lot of these things folks not verbatim i do not you shouldn't this message has become a bunch of quotes why because there's tradition luther said wesley said pentecost said brother branham said and they're standing today in a methodist and baptist church saying jesus said baptize in the name father son holy ghost and that's exactly what we're going to do because that's what the bible said that's this way brother brown said that come from the pits of hell amen the father son holy ghost whatever revelation you want to call it come from the pits of hell so where is it is it this way or this way it's got to be this way that's why brother branham come to change totally change our thought process totally he said let's go back into the back part of god's mind what about a man that said let's go into god's mind glory i believe he was god's mind talking to me and you not hearsay that's why we got to get away from all the traditions don't misunderstand me we need to have a lot of things but it's not going to get us to a body change it's just not but i couldn't shake his hand he's in a celestial body i could talk to him he just looks like he does there i look like i do so he had all that right see some of the pieces he had right right i'll look like me you'll look like you it doesn't change our features but he's saying they haven't got any of the five senses of t see tasteful smelling here well now that's not true because when he goes across into the into across the curtain of time he talks to them they hear him he talks back to them they he hears them he sees them he fills them now the taste is probably not going to be there or the smell because they're not in their right to be conditioned remember they told him said we we don't eat here they told him that we don't eat here but when we come back oh what a revelation but you would be immortal and you could see one another we'd live in the blessed realms by the altar of god what the sacrifice the altar is what the cross i'll read it to you in just a minute now let's go to the next quote everybody okay haven't had to say uh i can't remember now german chocolate cake now brother brown goes behind the curtain of time he's talking in 1965. it's not a myth it's not an idea let's just read the the red part save time it's not a myth it's not an idea it's not a spirit oh wait a minute it's been a spirit it's not a spirit he just said that okay it's not a spirit it's a man and a woman like you are just exactly then he talks about seeing the region of the lost where hey they were people there too in their theophanies everybody's got a theophany folks every person has one that's who you are that's the person that's your inner being right that's you jesus said don't worry about somebody can kill you body he said worry about the one that can kill your soul right only god can kill a soul even satan can't kill a soul he can kill your body and put you in another dimension but he can't kill even in the fifth dimension where the uh the satan worshipers you would say are in the fifth dimension he can't kill them god kills them god puts them in the lake of fire amen he created them he can take them out then years ago i seen the reasons of the lost there's no way that if i was an artist in other words it was so hideous now let's go in heaven or this place wherever it was i don't know what to call it he referred to it there as souls under the altar remember they were under a place there was some kind of bar withholding them from going on up higher right he said i want to see jesus there was a bar exactly where he said i want to see jesus now brother brown i'm seeing jesus on the earth remember when he was younger and he saw him out in the middle of the field kind of hovering over the the field there but he said i want to see jesus he said well he's a little higher you can't see him now why jesus is already in the glory five body jesus is in the seventh dimension he's sitting up there what that's the altar right that's where he is making a perpetuation for what those under that altar right amen that's why you don't have to have somebody pray for you you believe in god what he's already done brother branham says many times he said if god was standing here with a suit on he couldn't heal you what's he saying believe that it's already done believe in the unseen glory why do we have to have something that we see blessed is more blessed is he that what hadn't seen and believed and those that see and not believe or see and believe there's no way to explain how great it is now you just have to take my word i'm just a man but these visions always come to pass i don't believe he was in a vision i believe he was in that dimension god took him into that took his soul into that dimension but now his body couldn't go it had to stay there right whatever you want to call it he let him go across the curtain of time and see that and he was a young man standing here what a paradox he said i felt up and he's what brother he said i got hair i'm young again but now when he looked back he saw that 52 year old or 50 year old man laying on in the bed he said if i got to go back there yeah he had to go back now i want to take my word i'm just a man he's talking about the visions you say perfect it's beyond that superb it's beyond that sublime there's no word i'm down at the bottom if you'll raise it up please me be afraid to come to this i said do we eat said not not here we don't eat here but when we go back to earth we'll receive a body we can eat in they were telling him that exactly all right well i could feel them so there's you feel see and hear that's three of the things he didn't think you could do in that dimension they just proved him wrong by showing him that vision and remember god showed him the or this translation remember god showed him this before the fifth seal opened that was in 60 seals open in 63 see so god showed him and was preparing him to where he could reveal that seal to him showing him that those people were not these people they already had their white robes remember he said there was millions of them just coming over the hill with white robes on them amen well i could feel them they was just like that see and i said well you have oh yes they have a body just not a myth it's a body we know one another they all knowed me were hugging me millions of them i said well i want to see him who brought me here it said you can't see him now you have to wait okay so he he's just like the rest of us he's got to wait to see him in that glorified body when we meet him in the air amen amen why did you put me up here so you were a leader in life do you mean all them's brand rooms he says no that's your converse to christ i looked around and all the hard nights the trials all passed away when i could see their face a young woman ran up one of the most beautiful women she threw her arms around me said precious brother she was a woman but in there there's no sin see our glands are changed there you won't raise children no more there see all the same that sister's the one that the angel turned to him and said don't you remember her well he couldn't remember because the girl lady was 90-something years old and now she was 18. he said no wonder she said my precious brother is that okay right and what he said all right let's keep reading number seven ever present water from the rock 1961. when we die our souls will go under the altar of god where i was privileged to see a few mornings ago in the vision where the bible speaks of our spirits will go to god who give it our bodies shall return to the dust of the earth but someday when the scripture is fulfilled our spirits will be released from god we'll pick up the soul and the soul to the body and the power that'll raise us up is right in us now so see when they go over that other dimension they don't lose anything except their flesh because it was created in this first three dimensions right can't take it in another dimension your human body can't travel without god's help like stephen and some of them i mean not stephen but philip and some of them without god's help it's not a normal thing you know if there wasn't a law to that sons and daughters of god we create them a world out here and go live a private life on it you have the power in you to do it so why am i reading this this quote because you got the power now it's not when it's not when everything breaks and then and it's now now today today you have that power well i can't wait till that seventh seal opens well you know what you got it inside of you already you have the power in you to do it if you've got a shadow of the power of god in you you've got the power to do it god is omnipotent see what i mean the power that's in you will make you could speak a world in existence and go live on it hallelujah there you are all right everybody okay with that i'm not okay i can't find my last page joseph did i don't get my last page hmm i must have destroyed it i threw it away hold on just a minute everybody shake hands and say hallelujah here we go hallelujah hallelujah the seal they got it right there i could have just read it off of that so now let's get into the seal we've got all of this so the church ages are gone you and i are in another dimension and this is gonna happen this is the seal this is the opening of the the seal part we're gonna tear the seal like brother brown already tore it off we're just gonna reiterate what he said all right and see who these people are and when he had opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of god and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long o lord holy and true dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth they're asking them a question and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their brethren there's two things we've got to deal with here today all right that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled so now let's break this down real quick so now souls under the altar now here's the word i looked up altar and it's a word i can't pronounce so i'm going to try because if you look in webster's dictionary it tells you how to pronounce it when it says in the fifth seal souls under the altar that means metaphorically the cross on which christ suffered an expiatory death e-x-p-i-a-t-o-r-y expiratory death that means one able to make an atonement so we're all under the atonement that christ when he died at calvary he made an atonement right and we all live under that atonement i don't care we all that to me and then see that's that's not that's not an altar right but they're under an atonement of the cross those in the sixth dimension they couldn't see christ but they had to know he they were there for some reason and that he was there too somewhere you can't go over in a sixth dimension and get and have an eternal body and be young and not know that god did something for you they're not over there going well my mom and daddy no no the old things have passed away they know god gave them eternal life they know that they received christ when they were here and now when they passed away they just stepped over into another dimension into something brother brown said sublime can't even take the the word for amen but now these people are not in this dimension talking like the ones in the sixth dimension we just talked about because i'm fixing to tell you what they're saying the bible's already told us what they were saying okay because brother brown said if you in other words if you would have stood back and read that you would have known it wasn't now remember you said well it's uh hindsight's 20 20. when the seal's broke we can see it because we all read it the same way but if we would have just looked judge and avenge our blood brother brown said christians don't do that why in the world would you be in the sixth dimension going well i hope god just that guy that run me off the road and kill me i hope he just killed him no no that's right no they're over there going god if there's any way to save that person and bring him into the place i'm in now please go get him please go get him not not avenge our blood that sounds like with some we do something that's why i look everybody say that word right there temperance why you temper in the sixth dimension they don't have a temper but now in the fifth dimension they probably still do judge and avenge our blood they must know that something they were wrong some way and they're asking god to avenge what happened to them amen not in the sixth dimension remember you got to separate it they're all right with that you got to say this is not the souls under the altar we were just talking about in the sixth dimension they're already gone they there's no sixth dimension except the ones that's already got a glorified body and we're at the marriage supper actually we're waiting in another dimension until god can deal with the jews because who are these people right here they're not gentiles they're jews period they're jews god didn't blind the gentiles the gentiles blinded their south you and i are blind ourself in other words this is the cross on which christ suffered an expiatory or someone able to make an atonement death to appreciate that oneself the fruits of what christ in other words what christ did so what they're doing under in that sixth dimension they appreciated what god done which was the cross so you can put like i said i put the cross here but there's really no altar there's no there's no it says metaphorically metaphorically it doesn't metaphorically it's not the actual thing right it's like an allegory or a what is that a parable okay there is no look and there's no and see here you gotta think with me too there is no bloody jesus christ laying on an altar but brother madam will tell you that the bloody sacrifice is laying on the altar amen but christ is not in another dimension he's got a glorified body he's already seen the disciples and he wasn't all mangled up you know sure he had nail sprints in his hand and the side in his side but he wasn't dealing like a piece of hamburger media like a 20 year old guy right so he has changed but there was a perpetuation made something we can't see that we must believe that christ did that man did one time die on a cross did do what he said gave his soul for my soul remember the bible says he gave his soul a ransom so we could see his seed where did his seed come from not the loins it came from that soul so simple but the souls under the altar here are not gentiles they are jews so keep that in mind these are jew that fifth dimension is a is jewish people in another dimension right everybody all right with that all right and they were there when he had opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar of the souls of them that were slain for the word of god they were slain for the word of god not the word of god in the new testament the word of god of what the old testament said i cannot how can i forget israel he said how can i forget them he said look up count the stars look down count the sand of the sea of the sands on the on the beach in other words i can't forget israel now they lost their position hello come on people they lost their position they were the bride of christ first right but when they went and not only got a hoarse forehead they played the they played the harlot what they went to baal they went to maylock and who are all those other ones that they went toward set up the golden calf what they horde against god so once they did you can't take your wife back once she's been defiled hello you can't so christ can't take israel back his bride but he's not going to forget him because they had a position at one time so he can't forget him but they never were intimate with him you and i as gentiles were intimate with this man called jesus depart from me i never knew you and never had an intimate relationship with you that's the jews they never had an intimate what they they said let his blood be on us and our children they kicked him completely out called him belgiub but look they were slain for the word of god so what they were slain because of one thing they were a jew not they were good not they were bad not they were went to synagogue or didn't go to the synagogue they were slain but because they were jews okay or israel whatever you want to say people say well jews say the word but whatever god's chosen people the children of israel okay the children of israel is the 12 tribes and that's israel so let's leave it alone so they were slain for the word of god what they were slain because they said we're jews we're looking for the messiah we don't believe he's come yet we're looking for the messiah this is the way he's supposed to come and we're still looking for him the orthodox jew is still over there looking for him right now today for 2 000 years later they're still looking for him so these people were slain so in other words they were killed so these are souls under the altar they have went into another dimension right they were slain for the word of god and the testimony they held what was their testimony we're the people of god you remember rabbi richmond wasn't rabbi richmond got up at brother bishops and he said look people he said i'm a jew and he said i can't help it amen i'm a jew and i can't help but i was born a jew and i was born in israel and i'm under god's covenant for the jews and he's right he said i can't forget them god said i can't forget them that you're going to lose your position but i'm not going to ever forget you so they were slain for the testimony they held now we'll talk about this the next sunday a little bit but remember once they get into work let's look in our modern time with eichmann and hitler where six million jews were killed well that's part of that right that exactly right because the testimony they had was we're a jew hitler says okay you're a jew you're dead right you're jews you're gone six million of you we're gonna gash you shoot you do everything else so why are they saying that because you know what they were violently killed for no reason not they were murderers and you understand the laundry list they were just killed because they lived in a town called israel or jerusalem or they lived somewhere else and said we're jews you're dead hitler had no other reason to kill him except he was wanting to exterminate the jewish race so how long lord they cried with a loud voice saying how long oh lord true and holy and true so they know they're in a place and they're talking to god right they cried with a loud voice how long oh lord holy and true dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth they were killed on this earth and they're asking why when are you going to judge them and avenge our blood because you i see here's the way i see it lord you've put us in this place we're not we we're not anywhere else we're not mingled with the nations we're in this special place and i look over here and see some of my jew friends and i see this i see this i see all of jews right these are all jews what do you we were killed for no apparent reason except we were jews in other words what are you going to do about it that's pretty strong but you know what jews were that way brother the brother they'll go over there see how they're they're pretty belligerent people yeah pretty much so then what happens and white robes were given unto every one of them exactly and it was said unto them that they should rest in other words they're not being tormented here they're resting right so they're not in the fifth dimension they're in a dimension inside of a dimension no way i can see it hey look brother brother didn't see paul irenaeus and barton or none of them right he just saw his people right exactly right so there must be dimensions inside of dimensions if you never thought about that you need to start thinking about it in the sixth dimension there should be probably seven dimensions inside of that dimension you say how brother branham if he would have seen paul he'd have noted he made it brother brown said did paul make it he asked the angel did paul make it well now if i was sitting here looking at mark and we were on the other side and i said did mark make it no he's standing right here so paul was gathered with his people the messenger to ephesus brother dale's been covering it that latter rain is what it's a harvest right there was a harvest of paul's message in the people that harvested them into a dimension arenas sowed then when those people passed away they passed away under ireneus's message god harvested them and put them a dimension inside of a dimension that's all i can see so these people are in a dimension inside a dimension somewhere they're not in trouble because he says they should rest yet for a little season now what does that season cover 2 000 years because this fifth seal jew is from what christ at calvary till they go in until we go in the rapture then god starts dealing with them and then 144 thousands got to be killed all right so he's going to deal with them for a little season that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants in other words people just like them not gentiles jews and their brethren oh there must be some brethren coming in here should be killed as they were now watch 144 thousand liver rather 000 of their brethren now their brethren's not going into this dimension they're going to get their robes here but it says you got to wait until they're killed until their fellow servants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled so they're waiting on that 144 thousand to pass away or to be killed as they were because what i'll promise you according to the word of god every one of them 144 000 if you've got any question who they are they're all jews tribes of israel right lineages right lineages they can go back trace their lineage that's 144 000 but they're going to be given white robes here so they're not souls under the altar but they're crying how long until all this happens is everybody okay with that so their souls under the altar crying how long how long to avenge our blood that's not christians that's people that god literally blinded their eyes so that you and i could come in that may be hard for you to believe but you know what he's god and he can do what he wants to do know what we'll read it next sunday they cried for his blood be on us and our children and brother brown said god saved them anyway right glory but he put his hands over their eyes withheld them from seeing the revelation of who jesus christ was until they get into this dimension and what happens they said oh lord oh lord how long in other words they're taught they know they were put there because of something that happened and that god's the one that put them there so they know if god put them there we're okay and then that same god says rest for a little while in other words sit back you have been tortured for 2 000 years in that first three dimensions they have killed you just because you were a jew just because you said you were a jew man has killed you but now rest for a little while until your fellow servants and your brethren have to go through the kind of the same thing you did and they're going to get their robes on their side but we're going to all be together because that fifth seal jew is going to be right there somewhere with us that's right they're not going to hell so they're going to be right there somewhere mingling you know they're not ever going to live inside the city but they sure can populate the outside of the city and this great thing we call earth where we're going to that future home but they can go in and out but they can't stay because what god has got one word that you and i can't understand it's called grace try to write grace down and tell me what it is well it's because you're lost right there it's because i if you put because i you better stop right there right because grace is what unmerited favor there's no one little bitty dot of a thing you could do if if there was one dot you couldn't call it grace right that's what's going to change your body when we come to a fifth seal grace that shows that god is so graceful that he's gonna take this thing right here that we that we drive by all these cemeteries and we see i drive by one the other day drove by one the other day over at lebanon campground i thought god there's souls in another dimension somewhere but their bodies laying underneath that tombstone one day if they're born again that that ain't gonna be in there and they ain't gonna have to dig their way out they you're not gonna see a hand coming up luis you're not going to see a hand coming up out of the grave no they're going to come and get that glorified body and just as jesus walked through the wall to see the disciples they're just going to stand up and they're going to go man this feels good i'm back i got a human body i'm hungry brother larry i'm hungry give me something deep hey man but that's us that's not these people these people have to stay there for a little while longer they're not like you and me but you know what they have a special one little special group just to show grace god's got them people in a place then it's nothing but grave glory there's no way then people should ever be given eternal life you can't write it down you can't write down and say well they did that no it's all contrary just like i said listen that's what we think is this way kill them all lord you know you whatever what is that saying kill them and let god separate them now kill them all lord no no then people right there are going to be shouting as loud as you because that group of people got grace on this earth because this is where it started he give grace on this earth and grace put them in a place to hold them until we come to the fullness of grace because to me the fullness of grace is that capstone right there jesus christ come to bring grace amen there's grace grace the headstone is coming carrying white grace grace amazing grace amazing grace how sweet to sound right everybody all right with that so there's your fifth seal that's the seal part open so we must change our thought process and i know we have because you know what if you read the fifth seal you're going to read what brother erm said about this fifth sealed jew it was jewish people but realize one thing the different the only difference between them and us is we get ours here they're giving robes when they're already passed on don't you ever think you can do that because we come under a different uh i don't say a rule but we come under a different word right because that word in that fifth seal when it when god wrote it in the bible he wrote it for them people right there but he wrote an underlying meaning for us to get and that's what we'll get next sunday is everybody all right not next sunday maybe the next let me read you a little something right here before we get before we leave listen to this now i want to tell you this is this is an example of what kind of what i went through not comparing myself to the prophet but watch this brother branham on 11 12 on 11 12 of 1961 he preached a true sign that's overlooked women i'm talking about pentecostals this is paragraph 194. go up to the altar they begin pleading i've always been against an altar call i'm reading it verbatim might as well say it i don't believe in them there's no such a thing in the bible how can any man come lest god calls him you couldn't keep him away you don't have to call anything if god's calling him altar calls are a methodist idea that's right altar call they get a hold of them say john you know your mother died a long time ago oh boo hoo yes brother boo hoo that's not conversion right now cut it off now the next service which was 11 19 1961 which was seven days later from one sunday to the next watch what he said perfect perfect strength by perfect weakness i don't say this to be indifferent but sometimes under anointing now listen to what he said he said this under the anointing one week ago that he did not believe in altar calls see we're all now we're all of our brains are going to don't be nervous listen but sometimes under anointing you know things that you wouldn't you wouldn't darest tell the people you know what he's saying he said i thought this all along i just haven't never spoke it then sometimes under anointing something will slip out you see and you won't notice it and one of the things that i believe was said last sunday that might cause someone when i mentioned that i never did believe in altar calls i want to say that and clear that so you'll understand there never was an altar call made in all the bible there's no such a thing in the scripture nowhere down through the ages was it made until the methodist age about 200 years ago tradition if we're supposed to get back to the faith of the fathers they never made an altar call they never had a prayer line hello altar calls are when people come up and try to persuade and pull people come on john that's the reason this church listen to this that's the reason the church is all muddled up the way it is today is because of such things conviction you don't have to say a thing brother god's there and done done the work while peter spake these words the holy ghost fell on them that heard the word there's no altar call no such a thing no the altar is a place of prayer where every person coming to the church now i've seen this in several churches where they'll come people come through the door and instead before they pray they'll come down and kneel and pray then go to their seat now that's he said that's okay every person coming to the church should first go in kneel at the altar simply pray to god and offer their petition of prayer for their loved ones and thank god for what he has done for them then go back to the seat and then the church is the place where the word of god judgment begins at the house of god where the judgment of the word goes forth then but today we've changed that around so much we've changed that around so much now i have nothing again in this southern language i have nothing again anyone making altar calls see i've made a many of them and i'll probably make many more if i keep on going but just for my own self see you you collect too much and there's nothing against it no harm it's all right because listen jesus said no man can come to me except the father draws him first that's right that throws your altar call completely out all together our responsibility is to preach the word the bible said as many as believe was baptized repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for their mission their forgiveness of sins what be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the mention of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost right that okay but when you persuade and pull and scare people and talk people people must come sanely soberly under conviction and receive christ then the first thing they do as soon as they receive christ setting in their seats the next thing is be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the mission and sin that they have been convicted that they're wrong that's how they're remitted their sins because they have repented been baptized as a moral to the people i have received christ as my personal savior then you're a candidate for the holy ghost but now many people continue on persuading and calling to the altar and so forth which that's all right i'll go with that that's perfectly all right as far as i'm concerned anybody that wants to do it but to me it's not scriptural and i would like to stay with the scripture i'm just telling you what he said he said i don't believe in him and then he come back seven days later and he said they all said i said this but this is i want to explain it so that's the same way with with explaining what's going on with altar calls and things it was never in the early church it's a tradition that we've got used to and brother brown said that's all right but it's not scriptural it's a tradition i'm just telling you that i alters there never was an altar call made at any time in the bible there's no such a thing that's in paradox 1961. they didn't do it in the bible that's a tradition of our people originated formerly by the methodists but it's a good thing but i don't like a dried repentance either he said and faith is the substance 1951. so you see not meaning that you shouldn't make an altar call you shouldn't depend on them i've got to go to x church because they have altar calls really week week week faith right amen week week week faith now let me explain something else too somebody asked about a quote and i gave him one where brother brown says you come up to my prayer line in other words i'm going to paraphrase you come up my prayer line you don't get healed then you go to oral roberts prayer line you don't get healed you go to billy graham's prayer line you don't get healed he said that weakens your faith every time you go through there now let me make something clear if you need a prayer you come up here and be prayed for don't ever stop and we'll pray as earnest as we'll ever pray because it's life and death people it's life and death we are we are still human beings i don't care who it is but don't come back up here two weeks later for the same thing that weakens your faith i got joe's got the quote back there because i gave it to him last week that weakens your faith coming up for the same thing over and over again why you know what you're waiting on some light switch to come on you're waiting on some uh you know jerk or you wait you see what you're depending on satan can what impersonate every one of them but he cannot impersonate god calling you in your seat and you receive it in your altar of your heart and then it changed your life that was my whole thing i've seen people come to the altar cry scream snot and pray and they're out in the world now what did it do any good we're looking at what we're looking at a body change we're looking at where god is not going to speak through 50 000 000 people he's going to speak through you if your glorified body is inside of you then who's gonna bring it out i just read you in there you had enough you had enough power in your own body right now not over yonder that'd be real easy over there but right now brother brown said you got enough power in your body by the baptism of the holy ghost to you to create a world and go live on it put your hell by a bar what's the bar first three dimensions you know what your first bar is i can't that's the biggest bar i can't you know why cause you know what i didn't when i went to the grand canyon i didn't go over that rail i didn't say oh i can fly just like that well you'd have you'd have found me down there a little speck about that big but you know what if god ever told you you can walk right across that thing but you better know that it's god that told you that's why i want to say one more thing god works with individuals differently because we're gentiles if we need prayer please come be prayed for but just don't come up for the same thing every other sunday i got this problem i got this problem well you know what you either like it you know what brother brown said about that girl right and he didn't know what he said about that maniac they said brother brown did he get rid of that no he didn't get rid of it he said remember he said he said he liked it there's a lot of people like to be sick you know i got a sister-in-law that if she was totally healed she'd probably well i'm gonna say what she'd do they got to be sick to have some kind of something in life you know some old woe is me moment that ain't that we shouldn't be that way as christians we should be leaving our seat we should just like i said we should pray before we walk through that door expecting that god's gonna gonna reveal the word to you now revealing the word to you really revealing the word to you going from right here to here there's where the altar is you have went to the altar amen you have went to the altar that god wants to talk to you at sure he may talk listen i come right here december 17th 1997 i came right here and stood right in this spot and asked god to come into my life i needed that i was a young christian i don't care how old i was i was a young christian and i needed that right but now what would it be now after this many years 20 years 21 or so then i walk back up here and do the same thing that ain't even mental i mean that's not you see what i'm saying if you need prayer for something come and ask prayer me and june stood several years ago for our children when brother forney was standing right here and he said anybody that wants to come up for their children but you know what we don't come up every sunday and ask for that that night it was settled for me and her regardless of the circumstance and we didn't come up here to write a list i want my children saved and filled with the holy ghost that's it i can't save them you can't save them but you can try your best to get them away till they can be saved in other words pray for them claim them now what's claiming brother donnie claiming is they're yours not they're going to be yours they're yours your kid didn't become your kid when he turned 40 and 30 and no he was born your kid so he's your kid and whatever happens that's what i said by circumstances we come up here and we try to get rid of something and then it's like and i got a quote here i'm not going to read it because we're go musicians come because what happens is you turn around and you go back to your seat and you're still going leave it up there and don't worry about it no more don't come back up here the next sunday like this that makes you weaker because you gotta you're depending on something some light to come on some switch some angelic music to begin playing you understand what i'm saying you're waiting on something external when god said if i'm standing beside you son i can't heal you if i was standing right here today i can't heal you i did it at calvary believe that believe that right through all we do don't ever forget what happened to calvary because that's when the sin debt was paid that's when your body got healed that's when your glorified body come into being right so let's just believe that it's already done believe it's finished listen if abraham we're supposed to be abraham's children right right now abraham didn't stop every 15 minutes or even every 15 years and go all right god no he just kept on walking whatever happened over here to lot that was lot's business whatever happened to that remember he comes up to lot and he says look we got to separate in other words we've been going have you ever done this before we we've been going this way together a lot for a long time right he said lot you pick your way and i'll go the other way lord says i like this way because this is the way we go abraham said okay i'll take that way and you know what then god told him said abraham wherever the souls are your feet wherever the souls are your feet not what wherever the souls are your feet turn and walk and wherever you walk i'll give you that land what a great thing that god through a prophet told us that the very place that that abraham took communion with melchizedek is where the new city's going to push up amen abraham was looking for a city brother john it was under his feet he just couldn't see it but by faith he believed it what a great thing to know that that rock that rock that's going to build that new city was right there where abraham and and melchizedek were conversing with each other if they would have been if they would have had sonar they could have looked down and abraham said that's a big old pyramid looking rock down in that right brother brown said the very spot that he met melchizedek is where our new city is going to push up so it must start with you meeting melchizedek god in human flesh god in human flesh god in human flesh god in human flesh god in human flesh god in human flesh god in human flesh that's where you meet him let's stand so don't misunderstand me but i want you to not misunderstand me on this this has got us nothing but just a good life good christian walk sure we can commune with god but if we keep going in this direction right here we're going to get the same results got to turn and change our thinking to where god i believe what you said i don't need somebody to lay hands on me that's faith in you because remember god's going to deal with israel as a nation so what one gets the other one gets not gentiles not gentiles we're saved as individuals so we're sitting just like this we're like this we're up here down some here some are brand new some needs it brother ryan we were talking the other day you were talking about your children see you teach your children but lay your hands on the children but i'm going to tell you something let me give you a little secret that goes on this place all the time you'll actually say something that i've got a headache or i've got a cold i've got a backache how many times you've seen brother dale do this and just turn and never say a word and walk off what has he done he just touched your body and was praying for you i don't i don't lay my hands on june and have some great emotion she's sick what do we do we hug we hold each other up in my mind i'm saying god take this thing away from her glory you don't have to have all that right just if you want contact if you want contact i'll promise you you ever shake that man's hand and hug his neck he's prayed for you right amen he's prayed for you at that moment so whatever needs you got if your wife sit your kid's sick if your kid's sick you lay hands on that child because they believe that you can touch god so don't worry about that you lay hands on them amen i'm not talking about anything like that but when we grow into maturity though we should not need the same thing as we need as children we should know it should not become a knowledge it should become our person right that jesus christ is in you and has already healed you can't he can't double heal you he's already healed you you just gotta accept that glory i wasn't gonna be this long today but lord bless you i'm sorry but you take it by faith faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not what seen because if you see it you don't need faith but if you don't get an instant healing walk abraham continue to walk and i'll promise you if we do that god will meet you because he kept meeting abraham and all the whole path he just kept meeting abraham he was right there with him walking with him and when abraham needed something he was right there you're never alone right i was thinking the other day brother joe you know you know driving down the road and you don't even think you know i'm delivering mail then all of a sudden you have this pause moment and you go thank you lord just for a split second you showed me you were there now did i see god know did i see a pillow fire no did i see no he's here right he's not out here he's inside of you that's what we got what brother brown preached the message looking to the unseen that's what i said when we talk about that first four dimensions we can see that with our even with our natural lives but when we enter into that fifth dimension you've got to see something that you really can't believe how that god can give somebody eternal life and they really didn't want it and that he's got them preserved in a place and even talks about them in the bible and puts them in a seal right that's kind of hard to believe but you know what this is comfortable this is not right but who all believes in comfort no i believe this way will take you to comfort i just believe that right so we got to we got to change our whole thought process to believing god for yourself take him at his word that's what he wants we're supposed to be what spoken word children not touching children spoken word children god didn't need to touch adam adam was him made manifest in another form he didn't have to go around like i said before when that when adam looked at that big old thing with with a trunk on it he said that's an elephant that's a leopard that's a duck bill platypus i'd like to talk to him about that one but god's not over going no adam no no no no god was going that's exactly what i was thinking why because it was what he was thinking it was an extension of god almighty what are you you're an extension of god on this earth exactly right we're what we're the what we're sure we're eve but the second adam is now living inside of you so second eve can't fall hey man hey man he yeah you can't you can't fall sing a song or we'll be here all day [Music] man [Music] [Applause] [Music] yep [Music] thou art calling [Music] and pass them out so we're going to pray over them here plus we're going to pray for their safety and their journey and all the things that everything will be fine and you support your daddy and you support your dad and your mama okay all right everybody touch us right here dear heavenly father this is according to your
