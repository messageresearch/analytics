TRANSCRIPT
========================================
talking about choosing love love is a choice uh not so much this fairy tale love that Hollywood paints for us you know through movies and so forth about this love at first sight and this fairy tale sort of situation but real love starts and it continues in a lifelong journey and I'm talking about love our love with the Lord our relationship with him as well as love and marriage and so forth it should start and grow stronger as time goes on and uh so with that that's the review of the last lesson so I'm going to pray before we start on this new lesson of Revelation heavly father we thank you for letting us get to be here Lord today pray you bless this lesson for your people Lord let it be a blessing to them I pray pray bless the service today help with Donaldo ministering for us here and um all there the ministers and bride around the world bless all those others in Sunday School uh downstairs all the young people let it uh be a blessing to them as well pray be with brother Bob and family traveling today and also brother Michael away traveling and whoever else is out Lord today for various reasons Lord touch all them and be with them Lord and um bless all we forgot to pray for and just again just give us understanding as we studying you this morning in Jesus name amen um so as I was saying this uh real love requires intention it doesn't just happen accidentally and um also um take everything that I'd say in this lesson and all these series of Love lessons and also apply it to marriage almost all of what I'm saying about our love relationship with the Lord can be applied to marriage to help those of you who are married as well so um I I like to quote the phrase getting to know that girl um when I first met Gabby October 14th 2006 in monello Kentucky I just went up to introduced myself to a young lady who was sitting by herself I felt sorry for and I said well no youth should be left out at a young Camp Youth Camp I said I'm just going to go up make her feel welcome I walked away not thinking any more of her than anybody else any other pretty girl at a youth camp walked away and then something hit me in the head like a Bullet in the Brain and said you need to get to know that girl he didn't say go marry her he didn't say have four kids with her he didn't say spend your life with her he just said you need to get to know that girl and I didn't know why but um later I found out that he put in her every single little thing I'd been praying for for many years before that for a wife specific little details I've been asking God for for a wife he put that in her and I would not have known that if I had I got to know her everything we need we find in Christ and you don't know that unless you start this Revelation which I'm going to Define I made up the word it's I mean this it's been around a while that's you can find that word on various places but um for the sake of this lesson I want to Define that word as a relationship based on receiving Revelation from God simple as that we need Revelation more than anything we need to call on God for Revelation more than anything else in the world brother benam said it's so key so important for us to get to know him and in him we'll find everything we need okay everything we need for lives Jing everything we need spiritually uh naturally in every way so this relationship is so important uh 1 Corinthians 2 as is written ith not seen ear not heard neither ha entered into the heart of man the things which God ha prepared for them that love him God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yeah the Deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God which things we speak not in Words which man's Wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual we must be receiving revelation we have to have a real intimate relationship with the Lord otherwise it's kind of superficial you can have kind of a just a superficial re uh relationship with the Lord where you just kind of know him you believe him you love him but there comes a time where that's not enough when you need more and a more intimate relationship like brother Brown talked about that three- room house you know you you can know him for a while in the living room and or in the kitchen but some at some point you need to have an intimate relationship go further with the Lord and that requires this Revelation receiving of Revelation so talking about daily bread Isaiah 28 Whom Shall he teach knowledge and to whom shall he make uh to understand Doctrine them that are wean from the milk and drawn from the breast and for a while it's okay for us to drink milk but we need precept upon precept line upon line here little there little for stem lips and another Tong while I speak to this people I say that I'm quoting that precept upon precept line upon line here a little there a little because don't overlook those little Revelations it's all important if you look at I think brother Tony didn't you do the stone work outside the church whoever did the stone work out who did that I don't even know they hire okay so whoever did that if you notice there's big rocks and there's little rocks but they're all important any any building you look at there's big parts and there's little Parts but they're all important the smallest little pieces of Revelation that you get in your journey are all important I've been serving the lord for 28 years and since I was 12 and I look through the last 28 years of my life Journey and I think well there's mostly just little pieces here a little there a little precept upon precept line upon line very few of these Cornerstone Revelations there are a few of them though that turn my life around like coming to the message out of the Baptist Church and so forth but most of it made up of these little bitty pieces so don't overlook don't belittle those little bitty Revelations you get along the way that's all part of it so from uh Waters of Separation brother B says you come to the church water separation that's all right hear the word it's good you get separated from your sin but you go out with an intellectual Faith that's the reason you can't believe that's the reason you go back out and sin the way you do the reason you can't hold up from one Revival to another if you let the intellectual faith move down through your brain into your heart then it becomes a reality with a new birth then it'll stay there anchored forever God sealed you in by the Holy Spirit and it's settled forever you know um there was a time early on in the message I had had had that Cornerstone Revelation that God brought me to the message all right and I thought well I'm set now I'm set this is great this I'm at Lula I'm hearing the revelation of the word this is awesome this is where I need to be and I floated Along on pastor's coattail for a while cast in my vote and that's good to do say cast your vote with your pastor say he's my pastor I believe what he preaches about false Doctrine don't fully understand some what he brought out 2004 about certain false doctrines I didn't really quite follow it but he said uh he's preaching know this is what they preach and this is what brother brandham said and and now you decide what to believe and I didn't quite follow but I said I'm going to cast my vat with brother Dell I believe what he believes because he's my pastor that's good for a time but at some point you can't ride pastor's coil in 2006 Gabby and I both faced a situation about false Doctrine head-to-head for the first time we had to find out what we believe and we had to seek God desperately for Revelation about those doctrines because I couldn't disting English I couldn't really tell which way was right and that's when I believe the Lord was turning to me and saying Ryan who do you say I the son of man am Gabby who do you say I the son of man am can't be right in pastor's coat tell anymore so that's when we had another I had this Cornerstone Revelation and then it gave me a real Firm Foundation good foothold in the days of the voice this is quoted from Brother Luis October 30th yes I like to quot to our ministers because I believe what they're preaching and I believe in studying and going back and Rel listening what they preach because there is so much in there that you won't get sitting here in the service for me personally I have to go back and Rel listen multiple multiple times and that's what I do through the week Gabby does the same thing staying up till 2:00 or 3: in the morning she's up anyway she can't sleep she says you know it's insomnia or whatever she's going to be up for one reason or another but she dedicates that time to read and listen to or to listen to our ministers and I do to likewise when I'm driving the chicken truck and I find there's so many nuggets that I missed even when I sitting here in the service so that's part of what I'm saying here to come to this Revelation you have to go back and dig and and make some sacrifice and give up some things give up some time give some effort forfeit some sleep forfeit some food forfeit whatever you have to whatever stands in your way say get out of my way I'm coming if it's your job schedule you can change things around and give up whatever you have to to be here and to listen and then go back and relisten and study and pray and seek God I found out for many years as a daily Bible reader that I was still missing a lot you can read your Bible every day and devotions and you still miss a whole lot of this Revelation so I mean I it takes more than just daily Bible reading it takes more than study and comparing verse with verse brother bam said so brother Louise says it's not enough for just the preacher to study the word amen it's not enough for just the Evangelist to study the word the pastor amen you've got to take the open little book let me tell you what the book is open it's not closed so it's not too difficult to study amen praise God it's an open book in this hour amen God has spoken it amen through the seventh Church age messenger it's up to us to take it in it's up to you if you're going to take it in or not so the book is open the book is open and that's for sure amen so I told my dream couple years ago I think it was I had a dream I dream a lot and I dream in very intricate detail I don't know why very few of them I've ever had were really spiritual but I thought this one was and if it's not then I apologize and God forgive me for even mentioning it but I believe there's a lot of spiritual symbolism in here and I've meditated on it over the years and it's helped me I hope it'll help y'all so I'd had this dream early in the week and then I prayed and said Lord is that for me or should I I mentioned to the congregation come middle of that week I woke up from another sleep and heard brother Dell's voice distinctly say tell the dream so I I came to church that Wednesday night and brother Bob was preaching unbeliever make believer and unbeliever and I took that as another confirmation from the Lord because that's what the dream is about so in the dream and then I stood up and told the dream that's when I told it to the church here out in the parking lot this took place at church out in the parking lot that was not a parking lot it was a pond and I was walking around the bank of this Pond the circumference walking around and around and my hand I had two things one was some kind of a grain meal like we'll just say cornmeal I'm not sure something something for food and I was tossing it into the pond by handfuls the other ingredient was oil okay and I was pouring that into the pond and I was walking around and around the pond and uh at some point I don't know if this is uh significant or not I ran out of oil came into church to get more oil sister June as she is a helper so many people I believe that's part of her her Ministry in life is to help people she's helped me she's helped Gabby helped our family she's helped a lot of people here she's a helper she was the one in the basement here helping me get more oil I went back out excuse me and I went back to what I was doing walking around and around this Pond pouring in these ingredients all and some kind of meal all right and as I walked around I observed three different characters one was this boy similar to that in the picture doing what a boy typically does just immature jumping in and out of the pond he was never constant and let's just say the pond represents the word of God as water often does in scripture so let's just say that was the word of God he was in and out he was just up and down in and out never steady never constant he would jump in the pond and then run back and then he jump in again just kind of like playing Church you know here sometimes sometimes he's not sometimes he's here sometimes he's not you never know when that kind of believer or that kind of person is going to be at church there was this other character a young lady like that in the picture there on the left on a slide and it was fixed to where it was sliding down into the pool she never would slide in she had every opportunity easily to get into that pool and really get all the way in but she was just kind of like a borderline believer she was just sitting there she wouldn't get in she'd stay at the water but never get in always there but never got in and I kept walking around and around the pond and observed another character and this was a young lady I couldn't really see her clearly because of the the water it was kind of distorting my vision of her I could tell by looking down in the water as I walked around that far end of the pool or Pond as I kept walking around I would look down and I would see her looking up at me the whole time smiling and happy to receive what I was ministering to her is like handfuls of meal and or you know cornmeal or whatever and oil she was happy to receive it always in that water never moved always stable always steady always just content and and pacified if you will just to sit there and receive what was being ministered to her and she just watched me intently every time I made a pass she just watched me intently focused never in and out up and down never on the borderline always in completely submerged stay in there and to me she represents the True Believer the bride just stay in there always in that water always submerged always believing that's what a Believer does a Believer believes no matter what and stays in this Revelation always there uh seeking more of God and a close walk with him okay might refer back to that some more here in a moment so the Holy Ghost can't ever be false this is uh brother Wade from October 27th last year the Holy Ghost is always going to be true and if it falls on a True Believer it makes that person true everybody with me but remember God seals a group in and then he rebukes a group that he's trying to come on and they continue on thinking they've got this and they don't y'all are familiar with deception deception is where you really believe something something and you don't know you're wrong I never questioned the Trinity as a Baptist I never showed up at church one Sunday in the Baptist Church said I wonder about that Trinity is that really true never had a second thought about it until I came here never even had a thought about it being wrong that's called deception you can be in a deception but and you really believe it so the point is follow Christ no matter what and that Holy Ghost as part of the new birth process says he will Search Your Heart find what's wrong that you don't even know is wrong okay you don't know what's wrong if you're deceived all right well his job is he'll find that he's an expert he knows what's wrong in you when you don't and then he'll put a man in the pull pit to address it the problem is if you're not here that's a big problem you've missed your day of visitation please go back and relisten and dig that's part of what I'm talking about being that True Believer that girl under that pond that's always always here always listening intently focused and going back and realising and real listen and realising get every little nugget that you miss search for it like treasure like your life depends on it cuz you can go on in a deception and not know it so that was uh this is I think that's the same sermon yeah brother the way that was brother Banner's whole message he would look out on the whole congregation and he could discern who had the Holy Ghost and who didn't he could say move Pentecostal Church move you got to move with God there they sat on that slide like that girl in my dreams sitting on the slide would not fully move on and they just sit right there and he'd watch the Holy Ghost continue on everybody with me let's go let's don't do that here let's don't do that here well I'm sitting here at Lula I'm fine I'm comfortable everything is good I sat there for several years myself reading my Bible every day come to church every service sat there didn't know that there was something I was missing riding pastor's coatel believe in brother Dell and that's good believe brother way but there Comes A Time God will wink at your ignorance there comes a time when he commands you to repent of your own false Doctrine the things that you believe that you don't know is wrong yes that's what brother Bam's whole message was okay let's uh what kind of experience this is brother Bob black from October 20th what kind of experience are we talking about a personal encounter with Christ where you've read about it you've learned about it and then now you meet him you meet him it's a revelatory experience that transform you deep within because Christ has become personally known Revelation that's everything I'm talking about today Revelation you know him it's not that you just read about it but you now know him there's a transition know him on a superficial level that's fine keep going though just don't stop I'm begging you don't stop there I tell you what when you know him then you can fall in love with him him and you can begin to know him in these dark moments you praying beside your bed at night and David tossed around um as he would say the Deep call to the deep and also brother Bob I think that same sermon then you begin to know him it's not just something that you've heard about but you know him it's a deep internal change a complete shift in your nature now the new birth let's not get this wrong the new birth is the start of your regeneration you're going to begin to grow the statue perfect man you're just getting a place to grow now but I tell you what then you're when you're born again it starts something you're going to start to change something begins to change and makes you different deep internal change uh let's I think I repeated that but what you want you want more of God because you know the way to life is through the word you're going to get more life you got to come to the word all right and then you tell me a born- again Christian don't want some more word you tell me a born again Christian don't want to be in the house of God there's something that changes when you're born again you want more of the word because it brings you to the life not just a change in Behavior a transformation of identity from in Exodus brother benam says you're not saved because you pack a crucifix or because you go to church because you know your catechism your textbook you're not even saved because you know the Bible you're saved because you know the person Jesus Christ to know him is life not even know his word is life but to know him the person is life there's only one way to know him that's to be born again the spirit of God okay and then from the basis of Fellowship now you haven't you only live in a three room house I quoted this earlier you may have three or four room bedrooms pantries or so forth or the kitchen let's skip on down but uh that's right you live in a three- room house God lived in a three room house father son Holy Spirit you live in a three room house soul body and spirit uh the basis of Fellowship I got to really kind of rush along got something I want to get to here that's the kitchen part fellowshipping Faith coming by hearing then the next thing in the other room is the engagement room a lot of people think as long as they get into the kitchen that's all they have to do so there's that slide in my dream you're sitting on that slide at the pool or Pond always waiting but never getting in you're just feeding then you're just getting food uh fed basis of Fellowship but the next room is where only not only Fellowship but relationship comes and that's what's the matter with the church today they got a shame face you can't catch my Parable they don't want that relationship with God Revelation so they'd rather have some sto called formaly organization and Presbyterian methods Bap Pentecostal that really come down to the relationship with God okay uh this is Brother Wade um just about a month ago uh just it's our problem that we say well I don't know I don't understand that there's nothing in this Bible you can't understand if you'll get somebody if you'll pray hard enough God will explain it to you there's nobody here that cannot get this Revelation if you'll try and if you'll seek God God will never let you say well now you're just a dummy you don't understand that now has he ever told anybody that God won't tell you you're a dummy if you said that you told yourself that God didn't tell you that because you see people leave church because I can't understand what brother Dell says I can't understand what brother Wade I can't understand brother the Bob I'm just going to leave well you never had anything to begin with you can't leave the word of God and say that I can't understand that if you're born again you might not understand for a moment but keep going be patient that girl in the water in my dream in that pond she was patient she always sat right there intently focused on the ministry delivering the word to her she would never leave every time they made a minister would make a pass she was there receiving the word okay she would never leave that spot just weeks months years however long it takes stay right there God's obligated folks obligated to brothers and sisters he's obligated to put somebody in the pull pit that will explain your question you got to be here okay that's one thing about it you got to be here and if you're not at least go back and relisten over and over again brother benam said that he's obligated only a prophet can say that he's obligated God's obligated to put somebody the problem is that we hear something like that we close our ears up we don't go to study we don't get in our prayer closet and say God I didn't understand that word the man said today you said you'd explain it to me how many times have we had questions and brother Dell would preach something that we'd be like no I I don't know about that he said I'll raise my hand I'll raise both of them God can't send something something to his children and say I know you can't understand that but I'm going to put it in the Bible anyway God's not that way God will never do that he'd be unjust God and we crack that book during the week I'm going to preach here uh we don't crack that book open during the week and we don't study it we don't reread the scripture maybe or I read or brother Bob or brother Aaron Brother Lis so go back and restudy what was preached here you know we take notes and my me and my girls and we go back and every Saturday or so we have a Bible study that's based on just what's being preached we go back and riew the the notes the sermon the and relist the sermons that that were quoted from brother brandham and you know review the the scriptures and so forth um you just go and say well that was good it happens all the time happens all the time so why do we keep letting it happen all the time because if you don't understand God's G us somebody to help us understand he giv us a prophet he gave us a fful Ministry that's why you're not going to get it just sitting at home you're just not going to get it sitting at home re listening to tapes persever brother B said now I can't imagine them seeing that there was some people might have had might have been a borderline believer you know what that old man could have been right just the kind that hangs around the meetings you know it comes to every meeting and said that old man but never willing to come in never willing to accept it I may have to just skip on down to the main part here of what I wanted to quote because I'm running out of time main thing I wanted to get to is the church ages this is commonly quoted around here we're very familiar with it it's SE position of the seven Church ages then I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to give us Revelation we'll fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together we see that it won't take just an ordinary student study and thinking to make this book real it's going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people it will take one with prophetic Insight it will require the ability to hear from god require a supernatural instruction not just a student can bring verse with verse your daily Bible reading is good and don't stop that I believe in that I firmly believe in Daily Bible reading and devotions but don't stop right there it's like a devotion I read recently it's like if you read the Bible and you don't meditate on it it's kind of like eating food and not digesting it you're not going to get the nutrition you need so you need to read it but then meditate on it listen to the sermons but then meditate on them throughout the whole week uh mystery requires a teaching of the Spirit orever come becomes clear how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open become yielded of the spirit to hear and know so be that girl that bride submerged in the water in my dream be be that always submerged never in and out up and down wish you washing I have already said this book Revelation and consummation of scriptures even placed exactly right in the Canon scriptures at the end you cannot know why it says that Anyone who reads or hears it or so you can know um if you basically he's saying if you change or add to it you'll be cursed it would have to be so for who can add or take away from the perfect word of God okay uh M musicians can go ahead and make your way up here and I'll make a few more quotes here from Hebrews 12 wherefor see we are so compassed about so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us get out of your way whatever is hindering you like I said earlier job or whatever it is that would hinder you from being here from listening to sermons and Rel listening to them um from the days of John the Baptist till now the Kingdom of Heaven suffered violence and the B take it by force we need to be forceful the beginning of this year we were given a commission by brother uh Andrew Glover the main point he was making on the watch Night Service was keep walking and that doesn't sound very profound but it's really deep if you think about it it has to do with everything that I'm saying today just keep walking what if you might say R what if I'm that guy that's playing church I'm in and out will start being Church what if I'm the girl on the slide that's at the pool all the time but won't get fully in we'll go ahead and get in but really you can't put yourself in that you can't throw yourself in 2006 what happened to me was God intervened but I was continuing on I wouldn't stop but God's the one that moved me up higher God has to move you up higher in Revelation but you have to be there you got to make yourself available and so you you say well I'm not receiving Revelation just keep pressing keep praying keep serving God he's faithful um it's like brother Dell um he dedicated himself his whole life everything about him was dedicated to the word of God just be that person be fully submerged keeping that Revelation sh every day reading the Bible without meditating I already quoted this is like eating food without digesting it you don't get the nutrition you need unless you digest it you don't get the divine revelation you need without meditating on the word of God okay let's skip on ahead here um that's the way message is you can sympathize with and say it's right but you've got to take it yourself to become part of it and then the message become one you and the message become one then the anointing is with you as it was with the others okay so be that girl that's all I'm going to close with on that God bless you all and by the way we are short of a musician Brother Richard is out today he's been coughing a lot so brother Onin I think brother onen recently is he here okay okay you can come play bass if you like and Brother Joseph uh that was playing drums is Brother Joseph here no he's not here okay I'll I'll play drums all right God bless y'all [Music] my [Music] that I oh [Music]
