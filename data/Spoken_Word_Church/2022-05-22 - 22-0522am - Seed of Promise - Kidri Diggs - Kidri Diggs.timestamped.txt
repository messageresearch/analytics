[53:19] amen if you have your bibles
[53:22] uh let's go to luke
[53:25] chapter 8.
[53:28] luke
[53:31] saint luke
[53:36] chapter eight
[53:42] let's start reading that verse
[53:45] five
[53:47] luke chapter eight verse five
[53:52] a saw
[53:54] went out to sow his seed
[53:57] and as he sold some fell by the wayside
[54:00] and it was trodden down and the files of
[54:03] the air devoured it
[54:05] and some fell upon a rock
[54:07] and as soon as it was
[54:10] spring as it was sprung up it withered
[54:13] away because it lacked moisture
[54:16] and some fell among thorns
[54:19] and they
[54:20] and the thorns sprang up with it and
[54:22] choked it right
[54:24] and others fell on good ground and
[54:27] sprang up
[54:28] and bear fruit
[54:30] a hundred fold
[54:32] and when he had said these things he
[54:34] cried
[54:35] he that have an ear to hear let him hear
[54:39] and his disciples asked him saying
[54:42] what might this parable be
[54:45] and he said unto
[54:48] and he
[54:49] and he said unto you it is given to know
[54:51] the mysteries of the kingdom of god
[54:54] but to others
[54:55] in parables
[54:57] thus seeing they might not see and
[54:59] hearing they might not understand
[55:02] now the parable is this
[55:04] the seed is the word of god
[55:08] amen let's go to jeremiah 32
[55:12] and we want to um read verse 14.
[55:18] jeremiah 32 verse 14 the bible says thus
[55:21] saith the lord of hosts
[55:23] the god of israel
[55:25] take these evidences this evidence of
[55:28] the purchase
[55:29] both which is sealed and this evidence
[55:32] which is open
[55:34] put them in earthen vessels
[55:37] that they may continue
[55:39] many days
[55:40] amen may the lord bless you of his word
[55:42] you can have your seats
[55:47] amen by the grace of god today i want to
[55:49] use for a subject
[55:51] the seed of promise
[55:53] the seed of
[55:55] promise
[55:56] you know as we see in the book of luke
[55:59] the soul went out the soul
[56:02] and as he began to sow
[56:04] you know let's just let's just get right
[56:06] into it
[56:07] the sword was sowing the word
[56:10] and as the word went forth it landed on
[56:13] certain kinds of grounds but
[56:16] to make this thing you know kind of a
[56:19] visual
[56:20] i want us to understand that
[56:22] the word it will do what it's supposed
[56:25] to do
[56:26] there's never a problem with the word
[56:29] if you stick exactly with
[56:31] the divine inspiration that was given to
[56:34] us
[56:35] you will get the promise of that seed
[56:38] you get the promise of that word
[56:41] see the word is not altered it can't
[56:43] fail
[56:44] it can't come up short whatever god says
[56:47] in his word will come to pass
[56:50] because god cannot tell a lie
[56:52] hallelujah god cannot tell a lie
[56:56] god cannot fail so when we think of the
[56:59] word of god we ought to think of it as
[57:02] god making his promise
[57:04] but the problem is
[57:06] the ground that the word falls on
[57:09] but even when the ground is messed up
[57:12] the word still tries to come forward
[57:16] hallelujah it fellow it fell on uh
[57:20] grounds among thorns it still came
[57:22] forward
[57:24] hallelujah so there's nothing wrong with
[57:26] the word there's a promise in that word
[57:28] you know it fell by the wayside but it
[57:31] still came forward that's right
[57:32] hallelujah you know the scripture says
[57:35] that they were
[57:36] they they received it with joy
[57:38] hallelujah with the word king but other
[57:41] situations based upon that ground stop
[57:44] the word from coming forward
[57:46] hallelujah in its fullness
[57:48] that's what we're talking about
[57:50] the word of god should come forth in its
[57:53] fullness but you got to be the right
[57:55] kind of ground
[57:58] hallelujah
[58:00] you know a lot of times we you you know
[58:02] it's it's
[58:04] it's funny to me that we have so many
[58:06] churches and so many doctrines and
[58:08] denominations and and everybody say they
[58:11] are christian everybody say they got the
[58:13] truth well why ain't everybody bringing
[58:15] forth this word
[58:18] because there is a manifestation of the
[58:20] seed
[58:21] hallelujah i i i didn't do it today but
[58:24] i like i think i left it in my car
[58:27] but if i was to buy
[58:29] a bag of seeds holly
[58:31] from from from columbia south carolina
[58:34] if i bring let's just say the apples
[58:36] holly if i bring those those seeds of
[58:39] apples up here to lulu georgia
[58:41] hallelujah there's a promise in those
[58:44] seeds
[58:46] there's a life in those seeds all i got
[58:50] to do in lula georgia is find good
[58:52] ground
[58:54] and the promise of that seed even though
[58:56] i bought it in south carolina it'll
[58:58] still come forward in georgia
[59:01] all i need is the right kind of ground
[59:04] because there's nothing wrong with the
[59:06] promise
[59:07] hallelujah and i want you to know
[59:10] hallelujah if you are a child of god and
[59:13] his seed is inside of you life has to
[59:16] come forward
[59:19] amen
[59:20] but the ground has to be prepared
[59:22] hallelujah the ground has to be found
[59:25] worthy
[59:26] hallelujah the word the foolish of the
[59:28] word will never come forward on ground
[59:32] that is not ready
[59:35] the one always the one that always gives
[59:37] me it said it was it was um
[59:41] it was soul and ground and and it was
[59:44] among thorns and the thrones choked it
[59:47] all right
[59:49] oh my
[59:50] people are getting choked out
[59:53] by just their surroundings
[59:55] by just the the thieves they fellowship
[59:57] with
[59:58] hallelujah the people in their family
[1:00:00] the people in their jobs the people in
[1:00:02] their schools there's nothing wrong with
[1:00:04] the words you're hearing in this church
[1:00:07] it's the grounds

[1:11:39] right quick
[1:11:41] holy something the prophet god said
[1:11:44] and i i pray
[1:11:46] it does for you what it did for me
[1:11:49] hallelujah
[1:11:50] look
[1:11:51] you know we talk about troubles and and
[1:11:55] trials and situations in our life
[1:11:57] all the different things that that we go
[1:11:59] through and
[1:12:00] and we experience
[1:12:02] you know
[1:12:03] i'll just paraphrase it holy
[1:12:05] he said why does he say why does god
[1:12:07] allows trouble to come
[1:12:09] he said he takes trouble
[1:12:11] put a bit in his mouth harnesses it
[1:12:14] and takes it where it needs to go
[1:12:18] that's what god does
[1:12:20] your trouble my trouble your dirt my
[1:12:22] dirt god get on top of it
[1:12:25] and god said okay all right now this is
[1:12:27] what we're gonna do hallelujah we need
[1:12:29] to get these spirits out of his life so
[1:12:31] what i got to do is i got to expose it
[1:12:35] hallelujah and then it rises up what
[1:12:37] happens when you see dirt you clean it
[1:12:39] up
[1:12:40] right that's right hallelujah
[1:12:42] so that's what god does he lets our
[1:12:44] troubles and different things come he
[1:12:46] clean it up why so then we can't
[1:12:49] experience the promise
[1:12:51] hallelujah but you take that seed church
[1:12:54] and that seed with a promise of life
[1:12:56] inside of it it'll never come through a
[1:12:58] manifestation except first it's planted
[1:13:02] in dirt
[1:13:07] and as i read don't get nervous i'm
[1:13:09] about to close
[1:13:11] [Laughter]

[1:13:23] every different one of those seeds were
[1:13:25] planted in a certain ground a certain
[1:13:27] kind of dirt hallelujah
[1:13:29] but that word tried to come forth in his
[1:13:32] full strength it was the ground and the
[1:13:34] surroundings that stopped it from coming
[1:13:36] forward
[1:13:37] the bible said when jesus went back to
[1:13:40] nazareth he couldn't do many mighty
[1:13:41] works there because of the people's
[1:13:43] unbelief this was the god of glory
[1:13:47] this wasn't just a prophet this was god
[1:13:49] himself and unbelief hindered the
[1:13:52] supernatural that's right i hope you're
[1:13:55] not one of those people who are still
[1:13:57] discerning me
[1:14:00] i wonder where he's going with this

[1:32:21] of a life coming out
[1:32:23] even though you don't see it there's a
[1:32:26] mystery within the seed
[1:32:28] see nobody really knows who bride is
[1:32:34] you don't know
[1:32:35] we all look like brides but the only way
[1:32:38] we're gonna know who's who is when that
[1:32:40] date happens
[1:32:42] hallelujah and no doubt you're going to
[1:32:44] see some people that you doubted
[1:32:49] you're going to see some people
[1:32:51] hallelujah that you look that you look
[1:32:52] down on

[1:32:56] called serpent seed

[1:33:01] gonna say something you gonna see some
[1:33:03] people that you thought left the message
[1:33:11] just because they ain't in your church
[1:33:13] that don't mean they holding on to the
[1:33:14] revelation
[1:33:16] the message is a revelation
[1:33:18] and to make it even more
[1:33:20] even more precise the message of the
[1:33:23] hour is a person
[1:33:26] hallelujah
[1:33:27] the message is not books and tapes
[1:33:31] the message is not cds the message is
[1:33:34] not a table the message is a body of
[1:33:37] believers
[1:33:40] the message is the person
[1:33:43] i'm the message
[1:33:45] you're the message
[1:33:47] [Applause]
[1:33:49] remember hallelujah he says in the
[1:33:52] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:33:54] god and the word what happened to it the
[1:33:56] word became french
[1:33:58] [Music]
[1:34:02] hallelujah church if you don't believe
[1:34:04] it
[1:34:05] let's just look through the scripture
[1:34:07] remember
[1:34:08] in the old testament
[1:34:10] whenever they wanted to see god's
[1:34:12] presence it was a pill of fire or
[1:34:13] something
[1:34:15] it's a pill of fire by night a pillar
[1:34:17] cloud by day
[1:34:18] that was a representation of god
[1:34:21] they said the ark of the covenant was a
[1:34:22] reputation of god
[1:34:24] you know all the things behind the veil
[1:34:26] was a representation of god hallelujah
[1:34:29] but you notice hardly they had all these
[1:34:32] things going with them under that
[1:34:34] covenant but as the covenant began to
[1:34:36] change hallelujah y'all notice when
[1:34:39] jesus was born you never saw the pill of
[1:34:42] fire again
[1:34:45] because he was the vilifier
[1:34:48] you didn't have to see a rainbow you
[1:34:49] don't have to see none of that why
[1:34:51] because he was off
[1:34:53] hallelujah
[1:34:54] and as soon as he was crucified it
[1:34:57] appeared again
[1:34:58] in the book of acts to paul
[1:35:05] i hope you know your bible
[1:35:07] hallelujah
[1:35:09] amen that's what i love about the
[1:35:11] message it made the bible a new book
[1:35:16] as far as what we see
[1:35:19] not the letter of it what we see
[1:35:22] let's get it twisted it's not a nlv or
[1:35:24] uuv or
[1:35:26] lmnop
[1:35:30] no it's still the same word of god
[1:35:33] hello
[1:35:34] but look at all those times you never
[1:35:36] saw a pill of fire hallelujah as long as
[1:35:38] jesus was on the earth what no need for
[1:35:41] relics
[1:35:43] what no need for faith in those
[1:35:45] different sources and different things
[1:35:46] because he was there hallelujah and what
[1:35:49] once jesus was gone the pillar fire
[1:35:51] began to appear again the rainbow
[1:35:54] appeared again why because those things
[1:35:56] was a reflection they were a
[1:35:58] manifestation of who he was
[1:36:01] hallelujah
[1:36:02] hallelujah all of that was a part of the
[1:36:04] promise in church if we really we really
[1:36:07] dive into it we look at these things
[1:36:10] about the seed of promise when you take
[1:36:12] when you what's the manifestation
[1:36:15] of a tadpole
[1:36:17] a frog
[1:36:22] we are in a season of change
[1:36:24] holy
[1:36:25] what's the manifestation hallelujah
[1:36:28] of a caterpillar
[1:36:30] a butterfly
[1:36:32] it always goes into something else that
[1:36:35] he could never go back to
[1:36:47] amen what has god given us
[1:36:50] what is the potential of heaven
[1:36:52] what is the potential of the
[1:36:53] resurrection
[1:36:55] what is the potential of our body change
[1:36:57] now let's understand potential
[1:36:59] hallelujah the prophet of god said holy
[1:37:01] if you wanted an acorn tree you first
[1:37:04] start with what a acorn seed
[1:37:06] he said if you got that seed you
[1:37:08] potentially have the tree
[1:37:11] the seed hallelujah is a reflection of
[1:37:14] what's to come
[1:37:16] but the manifestation of that seed is
[1:37:18] the tree
[1:37:19] hallelujah so what is the potential of
[1:37:22] having for us what is the potential of
[1:37:24] the resurrection what is the potential
[1:37:26] of a body change for us it's the holy
[1:37:29] ghost
[1:37:31] when you get the holy ghost you are
[1:37:33] potentially resurrected
[1:37:36] hallelujah because it's a promise the
[1:37:39] prophet of god said it's the earnest
[1:37:42] what is earnest
[1:37:44] y'all know what earnest is
[1:37:47] let's make it real simple
[1:37:49] for those of you who own your own house
[1:37:51] before you bought that house they had a
[1:37:53] thing called earnest money right
[1:37:55] hallelujah you look at the house house
[1:37:57] it's beautiful you already got the loan
[1:38:00] they said but do you have any earnest
[1:38:02] money
[1:38:03] we want to see if you mean business
[1:38:05] you want to see if you really want this
[1:38:06] house so maybe the house was 200 000 or
[1:38:09] whatever it was you said they said can
[1:38:11] you put a thousand up
[1:38:13] can you put a thousand up just to you
[1:38:15] know to put on the house
[1:38:17] almost like a down payment
[1:38:19] so you willingly put that out because
[1:38:21] you want the house hold it so the
[1:38:24] earnest money is a guarantee that you
[1:38:27] can go forward with the deal
[1:38:32] as long as you didn't put something down
[1:38:34] in this house nobody else can write a
[1:38:36] contract on what's yours
[1:38:40] oh boy i felt that was in my shoulder
[1:38:42] now
[1:38:45] hallelujah
[1:38:47] oh my
[1:38:49] church hallelujah think about that
[1:38:51] once you have the earnest once you put
[1:38:54] the earnest down no matter whoever
[1:38:57] no matter whoever wants what you got
[1:38:59] another contract cannot be accepted
[1:39:02] until yours is done
[1:39:09] church the devil can't come and say well
[1:39:11] they did this they knew that god said no
[1:39:13] i already got the contract
[1:39:15] i already got the contract all i see is
[1:39:18] blood
[1:39:21] i got the contract all i see is joy and
[1:39:24] peace
[1:39:25] i got the contract all i see is divine
[1:39:28] healing hallelujah i already got to cut
[1:39:30] say you say no i think they see oh i'm
[1:39:32] sorry he said oh i'm sick he said no i
[1:39:34] got the contract
[1:39:36] fire strike by my shots
[1:39:39] he won't accept another deal
[1:39:43] and if somebody you know what you can do
[1:39:46] if you didn't put money down you got a
[1:39:48] contract
[1:39:49] and they accept somebody else's own over
[1:39:51] yours now you can sue
[1:39:54] some of y'all just sitting back just
[1:39:56] going through the motions you need to

[1:41:33] think about the seed and the
[1:41:35] manifestation
[1:41:37] of god and how he how it goes into the
[1:41:39] expression
[1:41:40] of what god is the expression of what
[1:41:43] he's done in different things church who
[1:41:45] who was the expression
[1:41:48] of john the baptist
[1:41:51] john's message holly john began to
[1:41:54] preach repentance and these things and
[1:41:56] ask john was he the messiah john said no
[1:41:59] i'm not the expression
[1:42:04] the expression is among you hallelujah
[1:42:06] his name was jesus

[1:42:11] the expression of elijah elisha

[1:42:20] so
[1:42:21] amen so everybody don't get nervous
[1:42:24] listen
[1:42:25] so since we talked about the promised
[1:42:27] seed and they're coming forth and the
[1:42:29] expression of that seed who's the
[1:42:31] expression of william branham's message
[1:42:41] it ain't jeffersonville
[1:42:43] as far as the state that's right
[1:42:46] it ain't arizona as far as the state
[1:42:49] it ain't georgia or south carolina as
[1:42:51] far as the state you ain't got to move
[1:42:53] to the state that ain't the expression
[1:42:55] hallelujah the expression of this
[1:42:57] message is a people
[1:43:03] it's a person
[1:43:07] when you look around
[1:43:09] the message wouldn't even come forth if
[1:43:11] there was no you
[1:43:15] it's very clear you look at his
[1:43:17] commission behold
[1:43:19] i send elijah no
[1:43:21] it says behold i seen you
[1:43:29] what
[1:43:30] me
[1:43:36] you sent god the prophet to me
[1:43:39] yes he did
[1:43:41] and i heard the voice of god
[1:43:44] i saw the expression of god
[1:43:46] i saw the miracles of god
[1:43:49] you said your brother you went down no i
[1:43:51] wasn't there physically but i was there
[1:43:53] when he changed my life
[1:43:55] [Applause]
[1:43:59] that's how i witnessed this message
[1:44:04] i could easily we all could easily take
[1:44:06] the testimonies of the prophet and the
[1:44:08] caribou and all these things and talk
[1:44:09] about all that but people be looking at
[1:44:11] you like man what you talking about
[1:44:14] but when you started to tell him what
[1:44:15] this message did in your life
[1:44:19] when you start to witness about your
[1:44:21] change
[1:44:22] then the message comes alive they can't
[1:44:25] argue with that
[1:44:27] that's right
[1:44:30] hallelujah
[1:44:34] listen
[1:44:35] before we go any further
[1:44:38] oh my
[1:44:39] church
[1:44:41] he says god
[1:44:43] but his predestination see
[1:44:45] has brought his seed to life
[1:44:48] and it's
[1:44:49] pressing itself
[1:44:51] see coming to light see that's what
[1:44:53] happened with all of us church
[1:44:55] think about it i want you to see the
[1:44:57] seed of promise
[1:44:59] god would have never let a word come
[1:45:01] forth if there was not a people to make
[1:45:04] it live
[1:45:08] look at how he did it
[1:45:10] can you agree
[1:45:11] even if we just take history can you
[1:45:13] agree with martin luther separated from
[1:45:16] the catholic church there was a people
[1:45:19] to follow him
[1:45:21] there was a people to carry on that
[1:45:24] inspiration
[1:45:26] there was a people to show that
[1:45:29] revelation
[1:45:30] that the just shall live by faith
[1:45:34] hallelujah
[1:45:35] so god got a hold of martin luther and
[1:45:38] he began to preach his message but the
[1:45:40] people manifested
[1:45:42] the people may live the people showed
[1:45:45] the whole world what martin luther was
[1:45:47] talking about
[1:45:48] hallelujah but then god didn't settle
[1:45:50] god kept unveiling himself
[1:45:54] and then wesley harley looked at martin
[1:45:56] luther him he's uh that's all right but
[1:45:58] y'all still smoking and drinking i
[1:46:00] believe god is a holy god
[1:46:03] i'ma still walk by faith but i'm gonna
[1:46:05] clean my life up and you know what there
[1:46:07] was a people hallelujah that could make
[1:46:10] what he was saying come into a full
[1:46:13] expression
[1:46:14] there are people who stop smoking stop
[1:46:16] drinking and begin to live a sanctified
[1:46:19] life
[1:46:21] hallelujah
[1:46:25] that's what them people say don't it
[1:46:26] don't
[1:46:27] it don't take all that but you gotta do
[1:46:29] all that god know your heart
[1:46:32] god is within me
[1:46:35] well
[1:46:36] i agree with that to a certain extent
[1:46:39] he within you if your vessel clean
[1:46:44] because the bible says hallelujah god is
[1:46:46] so holy
[1:46:48] that the angels are unclean in his
[1:46:50] presence
[1:46:52] and they never did nothing wrong
[1:46:57] and you gonna sit up there with all that
[1:46:59] stuff going through your mind and all
[1:47:00] your past and all this god is within me
[1:47:03] it don't take all that

[1:47:41] please
[1:47:43] girl go and play with your child please
[1:47:46] that's what we need to say to the devil
[1:47:48] hello
[1:47:49] you trying to tell us that god is not a
[1:47:51] holy god that he doesn't want us to be
[1:47:54] clean living hallelujah when the enemy
[1:47:56] comes speaking that nonsense you need to
[1:47:59] tell him child please
[1:48:05] why you be saying this all this crazy
[1:48:07] the way you be saying this because if
[1:48:08] you don't catch anything you're gonna
[1:48:10] catch my parables
[1:48:14] then you're gonna start thinking why was
[1:48:15] each other saying child pleasers she
[1:48:17] said boy the child plea was so funny
[1:48:19] he's a chocolate chopper oh yeah
[1:48:21] holiness
[1:48:24] holiness yeah
[1:48:26] you see that you see what i did i
[1:48:27] connected child please to holiness
[1:48:31] so you be in the house you tell somebody
[1:48:33] time please you say you got to be holy
[1:48:35] man
[1:48:37] [Applause]
[1:48:42] hallelujah
[1:48:44] but look at it he says
[1:48:46] see come into light and now on top of
[1:48:49] all that
[1:48:51] it has overcome
[1:48:55] what does it mean to be an overcomer
[1:48:57] look
[1:48:58] before i get ready to get out of here
[1:49:01] we think about we just went through a
[1:49:03] season of easter right
[1:49:05] we just went through a season where
[1:49:06] everybody's celebrating the resurrection
[1:49:09] holly
[1:49:10] but
[1:49:11] i appreciate
[1:49:13] the rising of christ
[1:49:15] without that we have nothing
[1:49:17] but can i say that it was more to it
[1:49:20] than that
[1:49:23] it was more to it than just god rising
[1:49:26] hallelujah because in the process of
[1:49:29] rising he did something for us
[1:49:32] hallelujah hallelujah when he went down
[1:49:34] in the grave he took my problems your
[1:49:38] problems everybody's problems in here
[1:49:40] and he crucified it
[1:49:43] hallelujah we always talk about the
[1:49:45] resurrection but we never talk about
[1:49:47] when he went to hell
[1:49:50] [Applause]
[1:49:55] my god is awesome
[1:49:57] she go by the church hallelujah when he
[1:49:59] changed dimensions and he would end up
[1:50:01] in hell with all our problems on his
[1:50:04] shoulders
[1:50:05] and now he's in the garden of hell
[1:50:07] hallelujah
[1:50:09] amen and these rounds are garrisons of
[1:50:11] demons hallelujah and jesus looks around
[1:50:15] all the demons looking at him because
[1:50:17] they doubted his power
[1:50:20] now they looking at him hallelujah and
[1:50:22] jesus knew he had to get to satan
[1:50:24] hallelujah but you know you got to get
[1:50:26] through all this illness before you get
[1:50:27] to him hallelujah so now jesus in hell
[1:50:30] surrounded around demons and now he
[1:50:33] stands up and all the demons are looking
[1:50:35] at him and jesus makes a step hallelujah
[1:50:38] and maybe the demon of diabetes he says
[1:50:41] jesus say sit down
[1:50:44] the master is here
[1:50:46] maybe he takes another step and the
[1:50:48] spirit of alcoholism begins to talk he
[1:50:51] says shut up
[1:50:52] the master is here and he takes another
[1:50:55] step and maybe the demon of depression
[1:50:58] begins to say so he says i said sit down
[1:51:02] the master is here
[1:51:10] every drug every sickness every hurt
[1:51:13] every pain jesus took control of hell
[1:51:22] that was before he rose
[1:51:27] if you're going through something
[1:51:29] you need to tell satan you ain't got no
[1:51:31] power
[1:51:33] i'm gonna drop something on y'all this
[1:51:35] morning gonna shake your boots
[1:51:40] we say it all the time right away oh my
[1:51:43] boy i feel like i'm in hell it's so much
[1:51:45] hell on the earth
[1:51:48] well let me tell you something
[1:51:50] god is controlling hell now
[1:51:54] hell don't belong to the devil no more
[1:51:57] when jesus died he went down into hell
[1:52:00] and he took over hell hallelujah so god
[1:52:03] is controlling my hell he's controlling
[1:52:06] your hell he's controlling the hell that
[1:52:08] would bother any of us
[1:52:12] satan don't get no credit
[1:52:15] he went down he took the keys to death
[1:52:18] hell and the grace
[1:52:20] [Applause]
[1:52:21] i can't even die unless it's the will of
[1:52:23] god
[1:52:27] [Applause]
[1:52:38] and all the devils could do
[1:52:40] is just sit there and
[1:52:43] okay look some of y'all doing
[1:52:49] that's all you could do
[1:52:51] he couldn't say nothing
[1:52:52] he couldn't react
[1:52:54] because god came down and took over the
[1:52:56] house
[1:52:57] god did a renovation
[1:53:00] it's still hell but god controlling hell
[1:53:02] now
[1:53:03] god tell the devil who he can try who he
[1:53:06] can't try
[1:53:07] that's right hallelujah
[1:53:09] go back and read the book of job he told
[1:53:11] the devil what he could do
[1:53:17] he told him who to try and who he
[1:53:19] couldn't try
[1:53:20] god is controlling your hell
[1:53:24] so when you go and do things adjust your
[1:53:26] attitude
[1:53:27] [Music]
[1:53:28] just your attitude
[1:53:29] first thing we say a lot of times we go
[1:53:31] through stuff there ain't nothing better
[1:53:32] to do
[1:53:34] be careful
[1:53:37] be careful
[1:53:39] it could be god doing something
[1:53:44] hallelujah
[1:53:46] pharaoh was doing everything he could do
[1:53:47] to let the people go
[1:53:50] go back and read it
[1:53:53] he was doing everything he could do he
[1:53:54] died let him go later you know god
[1:53:56] turned his heart a little bit
[1:53:58] he said y'all ain't going no way
[1:54:00] probably went back in there and slapped
[1:54:02] himself what i'm saying what i don't
[1:54:04] know why i can't let these people go
[1:54:09] god was controlling him
[1:54:15] you might not believe it
[1:54:17] god controlling your boss
[1:54:28] he can only do
[1:54:29] what works out for your goods
[1:54:33] and if that's being a pain to you
[1:54:36] it's working for your good
[1:54:41] god trying to give you some temperance
[1:54:44] some self-control
[1:54:47] you know you we've always got to stand
[1:54:48] up and flex who we are
[1:54:51] something go through you don't know what

[1:57:24] but when she was about to get married
[1:57:26] when she first started dating a young
[1:57:28] man

[1:57:31] because i ain't know him
[1:57:34] you know how we daddy's dude we
[1:57:35] protected
[1:57:37] so she's like daddy so and so he want to

[1:58:16] in my spirit
[1:58:18] he said look here cause you know what

[1:58:22] young girls don't get upset with your
[1:58:23] dads all they want is the best for you

[2:00:25] this thing was so powerful
[2:00:27] and god showed me i was like man i
[2:00:29] should have been operating in this thing
[2:00:31] by the way
[2:00:32] this ministry so power you can use it in
[2:00:34] all kind of situation
[2:00:36] so it's almost like a new doctrine but
[2:00:38] it's been around forever
[2:00:41] god gave me a new ministry it's called
[2:00:42] the shut your mouth ministry
[2:00:44] [Laughter]
[2:00:52] anybody know what i'm talking about
[2:00:55] that's a real live ministry
[2:00:57] it can save you from a lot of heartache
[2:00:59] and pain
[2:01:01] if you would just shake your mouth and
[2:01:04] mind your business
[2:01:11] [Music]
[2:01:15] y'all know what what we do a lot we talk
[2:01:17] about people and things
[2:01:19] that they
[2:01:20] supposedly going through
[2:01:22] and all it is is what you heard
[2:01:25] you ain't never talk to the person about
[2:01:26] it
[2:01:28] you're just going off assumptions
[2:01:30] oh i saw i saw your eyes can lie to you
[2:01:33] some of us ain't got 20 20 vision
[2:01:36] [Music]
[2:01:40] so the best thing to do is just shut
[2:01:42] your mouth
[2:01:44] that's the ministry guard gave me a boy
[2:01:45] i just love that thing
[2:01:47] love that thing

[2:02:18] he said but
[2:02:19] i ain't gonna do nothing
[2:02:22] unless i got your consent
[2:02:25] i was like oh

[2:02:45] look if you get my daughter
[2:02:47] by god's grace she didn't live pretty
[2:02:49] good y'all know as messy believers we
[2:02:50] spoil our kids
[2:02:52] cause we try to keep them from the world
[2:02:54] stop that stuff
[2:02:56] stop them them boys ain't gonna be boys
[2:02:58] they're gonna be mama's boys
[2:03:00] them girls ain't gonna be girls they're
[2:03:01] gonna be rebels
[2:03:03] stop spoiling these kids let them grow

[2:03:06] hallelujah let them teach them
[2:03:07] responsibility
[2:03:09] hallelujah and stop marrying these kids
[2:03:12] off when they're not ready
[2:03:15] [Music]
[2:03:20] brother branham said mary young if you
[2:03:23] ready
[2:03:24] if you got the holy spirit
[2:03:30] so he comes to me he says
[2:03:32] i want your consent
[2:03:34] he said but
[2:03:36] you know they always say the father's
[2:03:37] blessing he said what is the father's
[2:03:39] blessing
[2:03:40] he said we don't know we just young men
[2:03:42] we don't know i said well look my point
[2:03:43] of view is look
[2:03:45] if my daughter leaves me
[2:03:47] and
[2:03:48] you supposed to marry her
[2:03:49] you're supposed to take her higher
[2:03:52] naturally and spiritually
[2:03:53] her life is not supposed to go backwards
[2:03:58] if i give you this head ship that's why
[2:04:00] it's up here
[2:04:02] that's why i give you this handship it
[2:04:04] ain't supposed to turn into a shoulder
[2:04:05] ship
[2:04:06] or a hip ship
[2:04:08] or a calf ship or ankleship
[2:04:11] some of them is a footship
[2:04:14] it's supposed to stay to a spiritual
[2:04:16] headship
[2:04:17] and it's supposed to go higher and
[2:04:19] higher
[2:04:21] that's what we daddy's want
[2:04:23] hallelujah
[2:04:24] so when i told him i said simple well
[2:04:26] all the plans you got do them try to do
[2:04:28] as much as you can
[2:04:30] hallelujah to be a stable man before you
[2:04:33] get married
[2:04:34] because anything you go through when you
[2:04:36] get married she gonna go through it with
[2:04:38] you
[2:04:39] so try to be as stable as you can so you
[2:04:42] can go through the marriage without all
[2:04:44] kind of pressures
[2:04:47] because precious burst pipes
[2:04:50] so you know what i did i left it alone
[2:04:52] we all continued fellowship and
[2:04:54] everything
[2:04:55] and after we had that talk
[2:04:57] my daughter came to church
[2:04:59] she was already going to church
[2:05:01] but this day
[2:05:03] she got up after i began to step back
[2:05:06] she got up
[2:05:07] after the man preached she was the only
[2:05:09] one
[2:05:10] went to the altar rededicated her life
[2:05:13] back to god
[2:05:15] and since that point she's never been
[2:05:17] the same
[2:05:24] it's a seed of promise
[2:05:27] the holy ghost is unto you and unto your
[2:05:30] children amen
[2:05:32] in church this is what blew me away i
[2:05:34] was walking out of the church by the way
[2:05:36] my pastor stopped me and he said you
[2:05:38] know what god told me to leave them
[2:05:41] alone i was like oh
[2:05:44] he told me the same thing
[2:05:49] so when y'all see things going on in
[2:05:51] church don't be questioning the pastor
[2:05:54] god is in control
[2:05:55] [Music]
[2:05:57] god is in control you might say i know
[2:05:58] they doing this i know they did that
[2:06:01] god is in control
[2:06:03] it's a seed of promise hallelujah the
[2:06:06] reason why hallelujah he ain't got you
[2:06:08] up there doing that because you ain't
[2:06:10] got the spirit of a pastor
[2:06:14] if it was me i so and so and so that's
[2:06:17] why it ain't you
[2:06:24] hallelujah god give us a promise church
[2:06:27] and every promise will come to pass
[2:06:30] and you know what now
[2:06:32] my son-in-law
[2:06:33] is we can take the in-law part off now
[2:06:38] he's like my son
[2:06:41] hallelujah
[2:06:43] and what blew me away he knew nothing
[2:06:46] about this message
[2:06:48] had about this background that that's
[2:06:50] why that was about to go off on him
[2:06:53] he knew nothing about his troop and i
[2:06:55] ain't telling you girls go out here and
[2:06:56] get some boy who don't know nothing

[2:07:06] word the boy
[2:07:07] you hear that
[2:07:08] that ain't what i said

[2:07:34] glory to god
[2:07:36] [Applause]
[2:07:53] he's like my son
[2:07:57] when he got questions he called and
[2:07:59] asked me
[2:08:02] i'm gonna make your daddy's trip out now
[2:08:04] when i got questions i call him as him
[2:08:10] i could easily call my daughter but i
[2:08:12] get hillary respect as the head
[2:08:14] so i call him
[2:08:16] hallelujah
[2:08:18] and sometimes my daughter get mad
[2:08:19] because we'll be talking too much
[2:08:27] it's for the church but i love it
[2:08:30] she told me the other day
[2:08:31] say why he come home he got to tell me
