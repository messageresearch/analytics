[0:06] that's great that's great
[0:09] that's right
[0:11] now what I didn't say it was bad it was
[0:13] good
[0:15] but let's get in the back into the book
[0:17] of Romans because sometimes we get off
[0:19] course we need to get back before I say
[0:21] the truth in Christ I lie not my
[0:23] conscience always very witness in the
[0:25] Holy Ghost no this is Paul we are going
[0:27] to revisit this just for a moment that I
[0:31] have great heaviness and continual
[0:32] sorrow in my heart
[0:34] for I could wish that myself were
[0:38] accursed from Christ for my brethren my
[0:40] kinsmen according to the flesh don't
[0:42] know what did you all of the youth who
[0:44] are
[0:46] irritated the adoption and the glory and
[0:48] the covenants and giving them the law in
[0:50] the service of God and the promises
[0:53] you know Virgina asked me a question
[0:55] this morning at the breakfast table you
[0:57] should one's my favorite
[0:58] I
[1:00] guess you might say no not chapter book
[1:05] a favorite book of the Old Testament
[1:07] well Isaiah would be number one and
[1:09] Daniel would be number two because
[1:12] Isaiah is a complete commentary the
[1:15] Bible and Daniel is the book of
[1:17] Revelation to the Jew so we can see
[1:21] there that Israel is consistent who are
[1:24] Israelites to entertain the adoption and
[1:26] the glory and the covenants and the
[1:27] giving of the law services on the
[1:28] promisee if Israel would have stayed the
[1:30] way God wanted in the state state of
[1:32] course they suppose this painting they
[1:35] would have been his bride
[1:38] even Jesus when he come first coming
[1:41] said I don't go to Luke don't go to the
[1:43] Gentiles go to my people the lost sheep
[1:45] of the house of Israel I become the Old
[1:47] Testament had turned him down and we're
[1:49] going to read because there watch this
[1:52] whole summation today is going to end up
[1:54] right here we're brother though look as
[1:57] it is written behold I lay in Zion a
[1:59] stumbling stone a rock with fancy I
[2:01] believe with on them to not be ashamed
[2:02] they stumbled at the stumbling stone
[2:05] so instead of him staying here being the
[2:09] head of Israel he had to come down here
[2:12] and become the head of the Gentiles
[2:14] now his rule is coming in
[2:16] Israel is coming in not as children
[2:20] anymore but they are coming in as
[2:24] servants that's just the way it is I
[2:28] mean he literally lays that she can't be
[2:31] his bride anymore
[2:33] she was married to Israel if you read I
[2:35] believe even then I was asked somewhere
[2:37] in there says that I was married to thee
[2:40] Israel
[2:42] and you went whoring and I had to put
[2:44] you away across can't bring them back
[2:46] because you can't have a life that went
[2:49] out and had problems and you can't
[2:51] remarry her if she's went out to manage
[2:52] somebody else does the Bible tell you
[2:54] that well Christ can't break that law
[2:56] either right so he can't remarry Israel
[2:59] once he divorced her he's done with her
[3:01] but he won't forget her he said I'll
[3:03] never forget it so he's not gonna forget
[3:05] her you know he's gonna forget the ones
[3:08] in the Old Testament the Old Testament
[3:11] to me is is our foundation
[3:14] because remember the faith of the
[3:16] father's me sniffing business right the
[3:19] faith of the father's remember they were
[3:20] Jews and they everyone were born under
[3:22] the law
[3:24] the law was in the fact until Christ
[3:27] died actually the technically the law
[3:30] was in effect until the day of Pentecost
[3:32] and then it continued to be in effect as
[3:35] those that didn't believe that's what
[3:37] the Bible said and that's what Paul is
[3:38] telling us here but when the day of
[3:40] Pentecost come the King don't come
[3:44] the baptism of Holy Ghost and that
[3:46] brought into the many nations which Jews
[3:49] were taken to though 120-mm are all Jews
[3:51] as far as I understand they were all
[3:54] Jews so he the Holy Ghost fell in a
[3:57] Jewish dispensation first or juice my
[4:00] dispensation the Jewish people first
[4:02] that were under an Old Testament
[4:03] dispensation because remember until
[4:05] Christ died there was a Old Testament
[4:08] that's why the book of Matthew Mark Luke
[4:11] and John it's not in the New Testament
[4:13] that's not New Testament a great man
[4:16] gets it wrong but see they just think
[4:17] well that's Matthew then Jesus appears
[4:19] no he's got to die test there has to die
[4:22] for if he even said the testator has to
[4:24] die he holds up the company said this is
[4:27] the New Testament in my blood we haven't
[4:29] shed any blood yet but when he did
[4:31] that's when the New Testament we can sow
[4:33] the book of Acts is truly the first book
[4:35] of the New Testament right okay Matthew
[4:38] Mark Luke and John is a commentary about
[4:39] a man's life called Jesus Christ with
[4:41] just the son of man but it was still the
[4:43] Old Testament I was reading them back in
[4:45] the Book of Luke again
[4:47] because jesus heals the leper and then
[4:50] what's the first thing he tells them to
[4:51] do
[4:52] go to mode I'm sorry go get the priest
[4:56] and do the lot what Moses commanded them
[4:58] that if a
[5:01] leper
[5:02] was healed they had to come to the
[5:04] priest the priest had to check them out
[5:06] the priest basically the doctor right
[5:08] during that time here to look at the
[5:10] sores and the boils and all the things
[5:11] you read the need on the Old Testament
[5:13] it tells you pretty much the doctor of
[5:15] the whole place but he had to go show us
[5:17] him and do a sacrifice right because
[5:20] Jesus told him go do what Moses said
[5:22] what Moses a mode it was law
[5:25] okay and then Bible said to law having a
[5:28] shadow of things to come will we make it
[5:31] in there we made in Hebrews neck when
[5:33] maybe wrong
[5:34] I enjoy those chapter two
[5:36] books the Paul's telling us who are
[5:40] Israelites according to the flesh my
[5:43] kinsmen so Paul saying art this is my
[5:44] kin this is the Jews this is my kinfolk
[5:47] all right who are you sir lies to them
[5:50] pretends the adoption and the glory and
[5:52] the covenants and the giving of the law
[5:53] the service of God and the promises
[5:56] those are the fathers and of whom as
[5:59] concerning the flesh Christ came
[6:02] why Christ has come in the flesh in the
[6:05] Old Testament Christ wasn't in the flesh
[6:08] oh yeah I ain't here Dean milk hasn't
[6:09] eaten but he didn't he wasn't Jesus
[6:11] Christ right okay all right but the
[6:14] person in the flesh that was born in one
[6:17] there I got that he was Christ but he
[6:19] wasn't the Christ that we're talking
[6:21] about that Paul's talking about you
[6:22] gotta separate the two no cuz it it was
[6:25] not somebody to die for you the
[6:27] captain of the host all those that was
[6:30] just God putting on skin speaking to man
[6:33] and then stepping back out again that
[6:35] that couldn't hang on the cross when
[6:37] that wasn't our brother he has to be our
[6:39] brother we went through Romans a heirs
[6:41] and join heirs Melchizedek was enjoin
[6:44] air that's my right that's my brother
[6:45] Ram the Prophet had to come and say okay
[6:47] milk as a big we see him no more
[6:49] now we see Jesus Christ right okay
[6:52] because Melchizedek wasn't our Savior
[6:54] you have to Savior with him then the son
[6:56] of God was inside that flesh body but he
[6:59] wasn't even the Son of Man the Son of
[7:01] man had to be somebody born in a wound
[7:03] just like me and you
[7:05] come forth and die for our sins and then
[7:09] so his life could come back inside of
[7:11] you so his life comes inside of you you
[7:14] see that's the whole key many men could
[7:17] die from many men many men in the Old
[7:19] Testament died to save other people's
[7:21] life made only one man but
[7:24] physically
[7:26] didn't save him spiritually but there's
[7:29] only one man who can die and multiply
[7:31] his life out like he did over there ten
[7:34] thoughts and that was music rocks they
[7:37] had the son of God inside of him the Son
[7:38] of God is the one that separated
[7:40] remember we go to that a couple of
[7:42] Sundays ago and even dad covered it last
[7:44] Sunday he died son of man he wrote son
[7:46] of God he had to be in son of God in the
[7:48] church ages to spread his gospel to
[7:51] spread the holy oath and then as we were
[7:55] talking the other day he was kicked out
[7:56] of the church during the church ages and
[7:59] here he is staying at the door who was
[8:00] it was a man it was the son of a moth
[8:02] what was kicked out the Son of God was
[8:05] nice thing about this yesterday listen
[8:07] God is so gracious because under that
[8:09] sound our message there can be error
[8:12] listen to me because
[8:16] fourth church age
[8:18] over there anyway fourth church age
[8:21] right here
[8:24] God baptized people into the body in
[8:28] that church age that were Trinitarian
[8:30] right they had come under a false
[8:32] baptism that had come under all this
[8:34] eternal hell all these things Luther was
[8:37] the same way but you say well what was
[8:40] his his deal he still was God birthed
[8:44] the just shall live by faith
[8:46] but he went dicta ignorance of man and
[8:49] continued on baptizing them with the
[8:52] Holy Ghost put them end of the body even
[8:55] though they had error but remember they
[8:57] had error they had error and I'm a point
[9:00] Hebrew hip Pentecost had error the 1906
[9:03] Azusa Street Pentecost were Trinitarian
[9:05] only for 1912 the bishop Havel would
[9:08] reach or his even the history books tell
[9:09] you that that the bishop hey would come
[9:12] in in 1912 which was six years after the
[9:14] Holy Ghost fell so the Holy Ghost didn't
[9:17] follow a Trinitarian baptism if fellow
[9:21] the restoration of the gift right there
[9:23] I got that so you have faith for the
[9:25] time or a Holy Ghost for the time but
[9:27] now you and I have come to this age like
[9:30] we talked about Sunday afternoon Oh
[9:31] beast all day that was brother Browns
[9:33] message this was the son of man the head
[9:36] Pentecost brought people out it brought
[9:39] I'm saved they got him filled with the
[9:40] Holy Ghost even some of the great ones
[9:43] that Walter brother Brian Bosworth even
[9:45] Smith Wigglesworth around here if
[9:47] anybody wants to read about his his a
[9:49] round of this Jim it's a good book to
[9:50] read Smith Wigglesworth all they were
[9:53] Trinitarians but God went into a mess
[9:55] because they didn't have a message
[9:57] behind it meant workers work was a
[9:58] wonderful faith healer okay but he
[10:01] didn't have a
[10:03] brother Branham even in the 47 to 63 was
[10:08] doing like zerubabbel he was sweeping
[10:11] off the foundation and building the
[10:13] building was he trying to do he's trying
[10:15] to build it back up the manticore down
[10:16] right how do I tear you down crease and
[10:19] dogmas same way with Israel Israel
[10:22] toriel
[10:25] with Washington the pot remember Jesus
[10:29] Jesus even told them said you you shined
[10:31] the tombs and you're the ones who put
[10:33] them in there in other words you're a
[10:35] hypocrite you're setting us shining to
[10:37] turn them white washing it and cleaning
[10:38] it up but you're the one who put them in
[10:40] there
[10:42] who are Israelites the adoption and the
[10:45] glory the Covenant giving them long
[10:47] service and Jordan promises whose are
[10:49] the fathers and of them as concerning
[10:51] the flesh Christ came who is over all
[10:52] God blessed forever amen not as though
[10:56] the Word of God had taken none fact so
[10:58] in other words
[11:00] Paul's saying I've kind of give you a
[11:02] little glue my dad here that the Old
[11:04] Testament was this and God was kind of
[11:05] you know pushing no
[11:07] we're they're not all Israel which are
[11:09] Israel not as though the Word of God I
[11:11] take another fact now that means what I
[11:14] don't think it is what Paul is saying is
[11:16] he say now I'm not telling you to take
[11:18] the Old Testament scrolls and throw them
[11:20] away and burn them and don't ever read
[11:21] them same way with us we go man we that
[11:24] Old Testament you nice though there's a
[11:26] lot of Revelation in the Old Testament
[11:28] right but it's food for us revelation
[11:31] right I
[11:34] don't think Abraham lived his life on
[11:37] this earth
[11:39] realizing that one day four thousand
[11:42] years later they'd be a group of people
[11:45] sitting in here
[11:47] realizing we had to go the same way with
[11:49] him Abraham just got up and while he
[11:53] didn't have somebody to tell anyone
[11:54] today they got told he wanted so he just
[11:57] got up and walked and did this thing and
[11:59] you know and sure there was times he
[12:00] went there he went to Egypt there's a
[12:02] lot of times we go to Egypt he'd have
[12:03] been the world on time we travel you
[12:05] know the NGO de them didn't come out of
[12:06] agent went into career they went
[12:08] differently mentality journey
[12:10] but I don't think he just said that said
[12:12] well I think about 2018 there's gonna be
[12:15] a group people talk about me know he he
[12:17] probably passed on and probably figured
[12:20] that God did promise he gave him Isaac
[12:22] so I'm you know that's my promise was
[12:25] Isaac was my promise son so cuz you know
[12:29] what you take the kid up your only kid
[12:32] up the mountain and you get ready to
[12:33] kill him and and we think all that was
[12:36] just to act well the Bible says the
[12:39] angel caught his hand called it was
[12:41] coming down brother Brown said he would
[12:44] have killed that child if it hadn't been
[12:46] for that but Seco I knew that being the
[12:48] loyalty of a father though he
[12:51] was going to do it in the angel stopped
[12:54] him because of what I think was his
[12:57] promise see well you can't kill cumin
[12:59] seed and you know if having any progeny
[13:03] or our generation because that Isaac is
[13:07] dead gone laying in the grave his bodies
[13:09] M&E as sold in another dimension
[13:11] the true seed of Abraham
[13:15] hung on the cross and came back and had
[13:18] other children call me and you come
[13:20] remembers not seeds as of many but one
[13:23] seed which is Christ and that one seed
[13:25] is in the multiple form today neither
[13:28] because they are the seed of Abraham no
[13:30] one man not as though the Word of God
[13:31] had taken none thing so they are not all
[13:34] Israel which are Israel telling you last
[13:36] Sunday when we look at when we look at
[13:39] all these things that are going on
[13:40] b-bros you were talking about last week
[13:43] when you look at all these things that's
[13:45] going on and people say well you know
[13:47] the products falling apart no no no no
[13:49] no no no the bride never felt poor
[13:51] surprised never been in better shape no
[13:53] never never been in better shape than
[13:55] right now right it's just what you're
[13:57] looking at not all is rolling right
[13:59] that's Israel because I promise you if
[14:02] you if you come to this message all
[14:06] right I'm gonna make this strong if you
[14:08] come to this message and like somehow 34
[14:11] years walking this message and you
[14:13] reject this message that's blasphemy of
[14:16] the Holy Ghost because you blaspheme the
[14:19] word that's been brought to you for that
[14:21] day that day an hour that you're living
[14:23] in I don't care who you are or what you
[14:25] say you are you cannot take this truth
[14:28] and reject it now you can surely say I
[14:31] don't understand it now that's okay
[14:33] right can they still all things I don't
[14:34] understand but you can't just walk up
[14:37] and say well everything the problem said
[14:39] was wrong he was wrong all this was
[14:41] wrong he was wrong and all we got to do
[14:43] get back to the Bible
[14:45] well I believe what he brought was the
[14:47] Bible we couldn't understand it without
[14:50] him bringing it to us right so there you
[14:52] go I don't care what the bread of mine I
[14:55] listen I literally don't care what the
[14:57] brother Ryan was out there when he said
[14:58] he was I don't care if he was on the
[15:00] mountain down in the valley somebody's
[15:02] back porch he doesn't bother me he
[15:05] brought me the Word of God I really
[15:07] don't care all these other things are
[15:09] superficial is human being as human
[15:10] thought is human ideas whether he kills
[15:13] a brown bear I don't care I don't people
[15:16] get muddled up with that Popo he's
[15:19] coming back well that's a bunch of lazy
[15:21] people think she's coming back you have
[15:22] to preach us something to get us in a
[15:24] rapture because he said right from Fred
[15:26] laughing two books on tape
[15:33] no they don't Malky when you say what
[15:36] someone comes to the message and gets it
[15:44] someone that
[15:49] not exactly I'm saying I'm saying you've
[15:52] said and been taught
[15:54] before even a year
[15:57] our six-month and you reject what you've
[16:01] heard and say that's not true now if you
[16:04] say I don't understand it and you walk
[16:05] away you've got a chance right but to do
[16:09] like they're doing they're saying this
[16:11] is false and we're moving over to here
[16:14] well my how in the world can you get how
[16:17] can you know what we know and now go to
[16:20] a Baptist Church or the Methodist Church
[16:21] or earth yeah and a lot of them are
[16:24] going out completely out in the world
[16:26] you see a pig's with no Facebook sitting
[16:28] in the bar with the beer in your hands
[16:29] though and they used to preach the
[16:31] gospel right okay that's blaspheming the
[16:34] holy
[16:38] that just that just my semesters mine
[16:40] it's not my opinion that's what the
[16:42] Bible says yeah
[16:43] you can't walk in this tree and then
[16:46] turn it away no now it's not for
[16:49] everybody hey man it's not right give
[16:52] somebody book or tape and they say look
[16:53] that's okay but right they're fine I
[16:57] don't mean to find but I mean they've
[16:59] not they've not turned their day of
[17:02] grace away but if you walk in this for
[17:05] the length of time that we have
[17:07] coming to the knowledge of the tree that
[17:10] is in the Bible you come to the
[17:11] knowledge of the truth and turn away
[17:13] there's no more sacrifice there's not a
[17:14] sacrifice for that amen so because there
[17:18] is a ignorant sacrifice wait you wait
[17:20] backstage that's when you turn this
[17:21] message them away by Caesar
[17:24] and what it is it's a demonic thing
[17:26] that's possessed you
[17:28] let's talk about that for just a second
[17:31] I want to make something clear me and
[17:32] brother were talking about this even
[17:34] when brother Brown says you can go
[17:35] totally insane take your own life and
[17:37] still be a born-again believer
[17:39] okay so you got to separate that you
[17:42] can't just go okay yeah you can't do
[17:45] that because Baptist Church will tell
[17:47] you if you commit suicide you're going
[17:49] to hell there's no
[17:50] there's no if ands and buts about it you
[17:54] commit suicide the bad news commits
[17:56] suicide everybody's playa they know
[17:58] they're teaching says this person ain't
[18:01] making it that's right okay but now we
[18:04] know and understand that there's a
[18:06] separation you can one of them the point
[18:08] I'm making is the brother Ramsay that
[18:11] brother man talked about they had the
[18:13] Holy Ghost believe it did because
[18:14] brother Brown called him a child of God
[18:16] he got a spirit on him and he started
[18:18] drinking and doing things of the world
[18:20] said I'm not preaching the morning I see
[18:22] he didn't turn it down and he just
[18:24] something got on him and said I need
[18:26] them do them
[18:27] now remember what happened he didn't go
[18:30] on
[18:30] years brother Graham said six months
[18:33] later he was dead why because God took
[18:36] him home so not Mar his name he wasn't
[18:38] going to let somebody do that but now
[18:40] you see these people that's turned this
[18:42] message down though they're not dying
[18:44] suddenly they're continuing on wow they
[18:46] never had nothing to begin with that's
[18:48] what man Jules talking about you know
[18:49] they never had a birth to begin with
[18:51] don't care if they could preach like a
[18:52] house on fire the wind today they never
[18:54] had a birth that's the whole thing they
[18:57] just got an anointing and that anointing
[18:59] I'm anointed them to preach like when we
[19:01] were talking about this this brother and
[19:03] he's never preached in this church he
[19:04] preached from best woman and brother
[19:06] Donnie and all the ones like that young
[19:08] guy
[19:09] totally turned the message down and now
[19:12] he's got him a Pentecostal church down
[19:13] in Florida and him and his wife with a
[19:15] passion from Co pastor and they're just
[19:16] absolutely just blow I mean exploding
[19:18] the whole place having a good time
[19:20] people wonder how that happens that that
[19:22] anointing stayed on that guy he had an
[19:24] anointing but he used it wrong he turned
[19:27] it down oh yeah but he's he's he's big
[19:30] in a pickle my
[19:32] he's peaceful but let me just say it
[19:35] this way he's played in the truth that's
[19:37] right he's played in a true so he knows
[19:39] how to do it and then when he come out
[19:41] from under the truth he still has on the
[19:43] morning we're not yet doing this work
[19:49] might be to a degree but it's mostly
[19:52] mostly a rock-and-roll
[19:54] emotion lots and you know all that stuff
[19:58] feeling
[20:00] and you'll go to feelings every time
[20:02] when you should never do that yeah
[20:05] you should never do that
[20:09] like they say if you want a cold chill I
[20:11] put some ice tender but I don't mean
[20:14] nothing meant
[20:17] neither because they are the seed of
[20:19] Abraham are they all children but in
[20:22] Isaac shall thy seed be called shall thy
[20:24] seed be called see because not only
[20:26] Israel Israel they will walk in a round
[20:29] member when Jesus was here they told him
[20:31] we're the seed of Abraham
[20:33] he said if you were the real estate
[20:35] lower he said if you were the real
[20:37] cereal don't need any help if you were
[20:39] the real seed of Abraham you'd know who
[20:42] I was hey if you were the real seat
[20:45] which is what what what they were
[20:47] looking at was they could open up a page
[20:49] in their in their little genealogy book
[20:52] and they could say so and so begat so
[20:55] and so and so on so but God so and so
[20:57] and so and so and Here I am I come
[20:59] straight from Abraham and Jesus said I
[21:02] and even polishes endless genealogies
[21:05] well that's what they were doing they
[21:06] were going and I'm sure he'd been that
[21:08] with priests it was like we mean wrong I
[21:10] was born so on so that was born coming
[21:12] so that was born and so on so then come
[21:14] straight from Isaac
[21:16] not all there's no there's no balls in
[21:18] that's why they hated him here's all
[21:20] kinds of one hated him really Roman
[21:23] didn't hating his own people hated him
[21:25] they're the ones who want to stone him
[21:27] and killing
[21:28] the Gentiles received his message gladly
[21:32] pretty much you know
[21:34] but when he went in him selling dogs
[21:36] they hated that boy
[21:38] all right
[21:41] that's why I say popularity is not a
[21:43] good thing in the message because
[21:45] usually that means you've compromised
[21:46] somewhere
[21:47] if you're very unpopular then you've
[21:50] probably done something right that is
[21:52] they which are the children of the flesh
[21:53] these are not the children of God but
[21:55] the children of the promise are counted
[21:58] for the seed all right
[21:59] that is they which are the children of
[22:03] the flesh these are not the children of
[22:05] God I just explained that they could
[22:08] tell in their flesh where they came from
[22:09] I come from the seed of
[22:12] Joseph in addition and back and back and
[22:15] back and back to Abraham
[22:17] what was the promise the promise is what
[22:21] us the promises that he's going to have
[22:25] a seed of Abraham which is two-faced see
[22:27] not on the literal
[22:30] man seed you know gene gene terms see
[22:33] firm whatever go fell gotta forward see
[22:36] you never look at its flags that's what
[22:38] Steve comes from the flesh
[22:40] but God is the spirit they must worship
[22:43] in spirit and in truth they missed that
[22:44] point
[22:47] for this is the word of promise what
[22:49] this at this time will I come and Sarah
[22:51] shall have a son and not only this but
[22:55] when Rebecca also had conceived by one
[22:58] even fire father Isaac that's bringing
[23:01] it to here he's bringing a natural
[23:04] genealogy to show you as a kite that
[23:08] Sarah and Abraham begot a son his name
[23:11] was as a Isaac and Rebecca conceived and
[23:15] had children remember who do they have
[23:20] they're giving these off
[23:22] I
[23:24] mean look even you say well boy that
[23:27] that natural genealogy but what about
[23:29] Isaac and Rebekah standing there and
[23:31] they she had a set of twins
[23:35] Jacob goes this way Esau goes that leg
[23:39] and look what happened could Jesus come
[23:42] in the Bible said Jacob hello up then he
[23:44] saw that lady though they both come from
[23:46] the same woman I think brother Brown
[23:49] says one time come from godly parents so
[23:51] really so you can't count on
[23:53] mmm men's genealogy means nothing but
[23:59] now I'm telling you even when Jesus was
[24:00] on earth Paulo and all the ones they had
[24:03] to deal with that natural genealogy
[24:06] because that's what they lived in the
[24:07] Old Testament I come from this one they
[24:09] come from this one they came from this
[24:11] man you know what it had to be pure it
[24:13] couldn't be have any flaws in it or
[24:15] anything else it had to be pure liner he
[24:17] couldn't consulates good have been high
[24:19] priest
[24:21] all right he's interpolating here
[24:23] interpolating for the children being not
[24:25] yet born neither having done any good or
[24:28] evil that the purpose of God according
[24:30] to election might stand not of works but
[24:33] of him the caller now what is election
[24:39] 92nd
[24:45] but you're you're correct nevermind I'm
[24:47] sorry I thought you did predestinate I'm
[24:49] thinking ahead you said for knowledge
[24:50] that is exactly correct because
[24:55] sorry I was thinking ahead
[24:58] alright here's
[25:02] yeah
[25:05] no one is election
[25:08] the action is foreknowledge it's not
[25:12] totally predestination good you gotta go
[25:13] for knowledge first that's why I was
[25:15] thinking somebody was a predestination
[25:17] so
[25:17] so there's God
[25:20] let's go make the devil bigger than
[25:22] going there's
[25:25] okay now according to the election what
[25:29] is the election
[25:36] yes removes
[25:39] what is an election
[25:41] you know
[25:44] God voted for you the devil voted
[25:47] against you so you're 101 your kind
[25:50] who swings the vote
[25:53] you either vote this way and this way is
[25:57] always two-to-one are bigger than one so
[26:01] about foreknowledge he knew what you
[26:04] would choose
[26:05] therefore he could elect you to be
[26:09] chosen because listen if you take the
[26:11] election like people preaching the
[26:12] message and predestination like the
[26:14] original that's it it's just like I told
[26:16] you it's this and then it
[26:21] it's according to your choice everything
[26:24] is according to your course
[26:30] everything
[26:33] [Music]
[26:35] but in the true God we should all be
[26:37] safe so there's your boat and then with
[26:40] the bottle said I wish did everybody be
[26:42] safe every person to come out of the
[26:44] womb beats what he wants to save them
[26:45] but he can't why can't he free moral
[26:50] agents in crime you free more
[26:52] languishing then comes over here on this
[26:53] side of that side
[26:55] to me that's very simple about election
[27:01] but then we look at election but now
[27:04] look we look at the story of Jacob and
[27:05] East on which one what do you pay
[27:09] if you were looking at Mary and Martha
[27:11] which one you picked I glanced at the
[27:13] other day one other looks at Jesus and
[27:16] says Lord
[27:18] let me give you an example here's a
[27:21] woman sitting down beside Jesus and
[27:22] they're conversing and here's Martha or
[27:25] Mary can't remember you just put the
[27:26] name in and here just working cleaning
[27:29] the wall she's fixing the meal she's
[27:33] that's not one Jesus thing
[27:35] I'm telling you though that's not what
[27:37] Jesus said Jesus said she chose
[27:42] the better thing right
[27:45] don't you remember she's going by she
[27:47] and finally I believe she just stopped
[27:48] and said
[27:50] hello I'm sweating over here
[27:54] you go ah yeah are you gonna help you
[27:56] and get up man Jesus is like she's big
[27:59] she picked right I'm sure she went
[28:03] same way with Jacob Jacob was a shyster
[28:07] he got that birthright by
[28:09] stick from his old father that was black
[28:14] and he deceived him and he start went
[28:18] out and done what he's supposed to do he
[28:20] was the hunter he got everything you
[28:21] needed to eat and all that good stuff
[28:26] but
[28:28] like I said this is Paul interpolating
[28:30] because remember for those of you that
[28:32] had been here while Paul interpolates
[28:33] with parentheses because Paul's writing
[28:36] has seeped by one even our Father in IV
[28:38] it was said unto her the elder shall
[28:40] serve the other now if you didn't have
[28:41] this interpolated in there you wouldn't
[28:43] understand what he's done you see
[28:45] anything in parentheses Paul is stopping
[28:47] and saying okay I'm making a point but
[28:50] and I believe the Lord put that in there
[28:52] Paul didn't the Lord put that in there
[28:53] to explain what he's fixing to talk
[28:55] about for the children being yet not yet
[28:58] born neither having done any good or
[28:59] evil that the purpose of God according
[29:02] to election might stand not of works
[29:06] Martha the hill working working working
[29:08] working working he saw that they were
[29:11] working where he working working
[29:13] Jacob was brother out to Jacobs hunters
[29:15] mom's coat though
[29:17] probably didn't have a callus in their
[29:19] life mama didn't ever think once a month
[29:21] my boy it was said unto her the elder
[29:24] shall serve the younger as it is written
[29:27] Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated
[29:30] what shall we say then
[29:34] is there unrighteousness with God now
[29:37] what's he saying as we look at these
[29:39] scenarios we would think God would be
[29:40] unrighteous
[29:43] because you thought we go locally so we
[29:46] love the boy he does everything he don't
[29:48] deceive his daddy he goes out and kills
[29:50] deer and brings in fresh meat and Jacob
[29:53] probably is like saying Jacob probably
[29:55] hiding under his mother's coattails mom
[29:57] was doing everything for him
[29:59] so is there unrighteousness with God god
[30:02] forbid for he saith to Moses I will have
[30:05] mercy on whom I have mercy and I will
[30:08] have compassion on whom I will have
[30:10] compassion
[30:11] so there is not of him that will it nor
[30:16] of him that runneth but of God that
[30:19] short mercy because he knew Jacobs heart
[30:22] he knew Jacob wanted that birthright and
[30:23] he knew in E soft heart he never would
[30:26] want the perfect didn't mean nothing to
[30:28] him okay for the scripture saith unto
[30:32] Pharaoh even for this same purpose have
[30:34] I raised the other that I might show my
[30:36] power in thee and that my name might be
[30:38] declared throughout all the earth
[30:41] remember God hardened Pharaoh's heart
[30:44] several several several times in the Old
[30:46] Testament now listen to make election in
[30:49] foreknowledge stand
[30:51] god didn't walk in and go feral don't
[30:53] you let the people go
[30:55] he just gave him a scenario and Pharaoh
[30:58] chose which one to take okay it wasn't
[31:02] it it wasn't it God come in and he said
[31:05] now Pharaoh you don't need doing that
[31:06] huh don't you do something else knowing
[31:08] that he can't do that
[31:10] therefore hath he mercy on whom he will
[31:13] have mercy and whom he will he hardeneth
[31:16] because he knows your choice like that
[31:19] to help me more than anything okay you
[31:21] take people like Adolf Hitler and all
[31:23] these different one and even when we
[31:25] look now come to this folks and this is
[31:28] what's gonna really this is what will
[31:30] stump you come up to the end time and
[31:32] the beast and the false prophet goes
[31:34] into the way fire before there does
[31:36] before Judgment Day
[31:40] why kind of knows I'll never move men
[31:43] okay no don't ever repent
[31:47] then we're going to the lake fire before
[31:49] the day of judgment the Bible tells us
[31:51] that in Revelation def thrown into the
[31:54] lake of fire before the watch come good
[31:56] what
[32:02] really you know what a wife nor judgment
[32:04] is and for you to judge yourself
[32:07] they're judging themself
[32:11] Jesus Christ is going hey you turn me
[32:13] down and they said yes with it so who's
[32:16] judging there we good
[32:18] now these that have left the message and
[32:21] think they're still in the Bible to me
[32:22] they're the ones they come up to that
[32:25] day and say have I not cast out Devils
[32:27] have I not prophesied have I not done
[32:29] this have I not done that and you'll say
[32:32] depart from me I never knew you and that
[32:34] word new in that
[32:36] it's just like Adam knew his wife he was
[32:39] an intimate not a sexual relationship
[32:41] but an intimate relationship he said I
[32:43] never knew you that's the same news when
[32:46] Adam knew his wife Eve so it's an
[32:48] instant hit yes when he told them he
[32:50] said you've got all this but you never
[32:51] had an intimate well what does an
[32:52] intimate relationship with God if the
[32:55] Holy Ghost you have an intimate
[32:56] relationship we go right
[33:02] rough nothing now we'll say then unto me
[33:06] why doth he yet find fault for who has
[33:10] resisted his will what nay but o man who
[33:14] art thou that repliest against none
[33:17] shall the thing formed say to him that
[33:20] formed it why hast thou formed or made
[33:23] me thus
[33:26] people take that wrong that tells me
[33:29] that when those people go to the white
[33:30] throne judgment they're not going to ask
[33:32] him - why'd you make me wrong they know
[33:35] why they were wrong they did the wrong
[33:37] God didn't make him do wrong if he made
[33:40] him do wrong he's dying - giving me
[33:41] eternal life and he's because he
[33:43] wouldn't be just a factor he's got to be
[33:45] a just God and I just die means just
[33:47] this that's where the word justice come
[33:50] from judge justice okay what a half's
[33:54] now made me this hath not the Potter
[33:56] power over the clay of the same lump to
[34:00] make one vessel
[34:01] honour and another unto dishonour God
[34:03] knowing our choice
[34:06] that's what I said about Adolf Hitler
[34:08] hidden God through his foreknowledge
[34:11] knew if he gave Adolf Hitler a million
[34:14] years to repent he said I you can live a
[34:16] million years I tell Hitler and he can't
[34:18] force him to do it he'd never repent
[34:21] that's right he knew that so about
[34:23] foreknowledge we knew that so by
[34:24] foreknowledge he knew the beast and the
[34:26] false prophet and yeah that
[34:27] foreknowledge he knows that the people
[34:28] would want on Kobol what they're gonna
[34:30] do but there's gonna be some surprises
[34:31] that twice come judgment he's going to
[34:33] give eternal life to somebody that don't
[34:35] even want it that's been good to you
[34:39] drown I believe that 100%
[34:44] what if what if God come up willing to
[34:49] show his wrath and to make his power
[34:51] known endured with much long-suffering
[34:53] the vessels of Wrath fitted for
[34:56] destruction that's what I'm just telling
[34:57] you what if God willing to show his
[35:00] wrath to make his power known endured
[35:02] with much long-suffering the vessels of
[35:05] Wrath fitted for destruction now he knew
[35:07] before Adolf Hitler was born what he was
[35:09] gonna do so why he just killed him as a
[35:11] baby
[35:12] you can't give them any baby I'd give
[35:15] him with joy life say okay do you kill
[35:18] him as a baby you know if everyone who
[35:19] went to heaven
[35:22] right Oh baby's gonna have so he lay
[35:26] upon
[35:27] does he knew you had come to a place and
[35:30] then somewhere the active term gone down
[35:32] Lord we don't ever go that's to me that
[35:35] was the most easiest thing a man to do
[35:36] him and that doctor his mingling
[35:42] recently
[35:43] but all that was was in same demons that
[35:46] was that was back in the Old Testament
[35:49] persecuting Israel they just came into
[35:51] the into the 1940s and then that demons
[35:55] not dead it's going to go over into the
[35:57] two witnesses and Israel they're gonna
[35:59] kill them so you know they that we got
[36:03] to kill all the Jews think yeah and then
[36:05] he might make known the riches of his
[36:07] glory on the vessels of Mercy which he
[36:10] had the for preparing the glory
[36:13] the irrelevant preach on the law
[36:15] contrast you got to have something bad
[36:18] to have something good but that's what
[36:19] this is here he had to have something by
[36:23] had to let something allow something to
[36:25] be bad so that he can take the good out
[36:28] of it I desire to be yes exactly just
[36:32] like the Garden of Eden he took
[36:33] something beautiful allow Satan to come
[36:35] in but he allowed it to make a choice
[36:37] and listen we be for Eve to death I
[36:40] don't maybe I don't want to sold us out
[36:42] evening right I don't want it sold us
[36:44] out
[36:46] all right but being that they were one
[36:49] you couldn't kill one yeah
[36:52] all right and then he might make known
[36:54] the riches of his glory on the vessels
[36:56] of mercy us which he had a for
[36:59] foreknowledge prepared unto glory
[37:02] even us whom he have called none of the
[37:05] Jews only but also of the Gentiles he's
[37:08] asking the question and he said also in
[37:11] OCR that would be let's look at that
[37:15] would be what the book of
[37:18] pulls that
[37:20] hold that so he's quoting scripture
[37:23] right
[37:25] when a book of Hosea I will call them my
[37:27] people which were not my people
[37:29] jinn health and her beloved which was
[37:33] not beloved the Gentiles this is talk
[37:34] about the Gentiles coming in God loved
[37:36] Israel he still does love Israel but he
[37:39] had to put her away when she went with
[37:42] another man another doctor in another
[37:44] you know doctrine of balaam and all that
[37:47] he had to put her away to the king take
[37:48] her back and it shall come to pass that
[37:51] in the place where it was said unto them
[37:53] ye are not my people there shall they be
[37:55] called the children of the Living God
[37:58] because remember he told them he said
[37:59] don't go to don't go to Gentile
[38:03] he came to his own and his own received
[38:05] him not he came to a Jewish place and
[38:08] they turned him down
[38:10] Esau also cried concerning Israel though
[38:15] the number of the children of Israel has
[38:17] beat the sands of the sea a remnant
[38:18] shall be saved for he will finish the
[38:21] work and cut it short in righteousness
[38:23] because the short work was the Lord mate
[38:25] on the earth as and as Esau stood before
[38:29] except the lord of sabbath had left us a
[38:32] seed we had bad stardom the benz
[38:34] Gomorrah well that's not he saw that's
[38:37] out there sorry
[38:39] yep story its Isaiah Isaiah said so this
[38:44] is quoting isaiah i said the lord of
[38:46] sabbath had left us a seed we've been
[38:48] inside of them been gamar what shall we
[38:50] say then that
[38:52] the Gentiles which followed not after
[38:54] righteousness have obtained to
[38:56] righteousness even the righteousness
[38:57] which is of faith comes remember Israel
[39:01] was not so much a faith
[39:04] nation they needed signs and wonders
[39:07] Jarius come and touch my daughter coming
[39:10] but what did he see when he saw the
[39:13] centurion which was a Gentile said Lord
[39:16] no you don't even have to come how few
[39:17] to speak for you have authority to speak
[39:19] the word he said I'm not seeing any
[39:21] faith in Israel like this why because
[39:24] there's not what they have faith you
[39:27] know what they had they depended on the
[39:29] Toro the letter of the word is what they
[39:33] defended them right the Gentiles that
[39:37] Centurion didn't know probably one
[39:41] commandment okay he is never probably
[39:44] ever been in a synagogue before Yeah
