TRANSCRIPT
========================================
is your tater and your kill juice and I get it anyone right Nicola is always a hideous and our knowing to do better and you do it anyway okay make it an endocrine kind of sand on beliefs of some of them wanted and didn't didn't know that when you said emotional blinded him know that was never side that killing them so sin well the window deep Jesus brother Brown said that the Jews made their fatal mistake Joshua Eagle able piano plays era Otto Charlotte Haven towing I see Charlotte you go play the man you can play he's an i played organ I said we'll go up and setting out late ordinance okay anyway hello is this a good thing extern is throwing up so anyway um we don't think that for those of you to come in later number one please do not turn that register all we roast in here doing somebody keep turning off pushing you pushing it off wasn't it I'm not turning to register off one if you are the old if you I know who's what listen I believe we all long live I'm just birthday to me what but those Jesus over there did not know that's the thing I believe somebody I mean yes somebody does lunch to turn it back on it off funny only Ronald listen hey special flashes mop listen my floor here you can have all your pinions you want it we have a new air conditioned see if you shut that off there's nothing but stale air in here and when we walked in this morning on you it was closed because it's stale air that is the air to circulate back forward and I knew it was off so don't turn it off number one for circulation and number two some of us ride right but those of you that are cold you know even if you eat there in between services move somewhere else or if you shut it off turning back on but most of you did shut it stuff off don't remember terms okay go because I don't do that i do that was that so you know let's they do is leave it on and just deal with it bring your sweater get you get you over all mine oh right what was your question again Brian had a question making an end of iniquity is when they do the reconciliation for anything like a so if you make an end of sin pantis in absolute yep they knew not to kill him right they know he was 10 see brother brown yet they should have known it they were looking for the Messiah it wasn't like that works see the heat member c program said the heath and went even looking for anybody but the jews were definitely looking for a messiah and he came the exact way he was supposed to come right through the bible and they turned him down see that's iniquities actually knowing better they know the Messiah was coming they knew that they were he was supposed to do those things but he said the greatest mistake they made it was in that same damn 17 weeks we may read it later on then the Jews with the greatest mistake they made was is when they said let his blood be on us and our children so for perpetual generations that's what his room has been dispersed killed shot gasps and everything else is because of that one statement they said let his blood be on us in our children that was the same I was that was iniquity and saying both I'm in it anybody in sends the same thing sin because there's a file on there because you when you were a center did you know better no you did it but but once the consciousness comes to you though not to do something and you do it anyway that's iniquity I would say more let me put it this way real simple a center-to-center but a Christian can have an equity we do things that we are supposed to do and we know we ain't supposed to mean that's iniquity okay which is the hideous thing that's knowing to do better because the world today don't know to do better they just fit this under the anointing of the age and and you know they're just they're gonna be judged such but the one is going to be judged them harshest is when it goes up and says have I not cast out devils and all that stuff but shadow remember that Jesus blab it there that's right thank God put daddy he blinded their eyes so that we can come in actually this was one of the question told you we were going to run off some copies but drummer Hoff any copies today my coffee maker was in Atlanta all last week my computer died Jim's computer with her when I could get anything off of so she was done with it sailing not know do not be sorry don't know where that anything else I mean what would you say that in equity is a more advanced age yes seeing is your sin a guy go to smoke cigarettes he smoked always loud he does not get up in the morning and go man all right but right there's no condemnation but now somebody that says going to go to church and say they come to church and I started doing good and justified sanctified cleaned up but remember what island owl said that person will go right back if you don't get it cleaned and swept but the devil is going to come back and bring it again not to me that's iniquity that's knowing you have come under a religious order now you know better and that can't ever go away from you can't believe amnesia and with God he said no you you know you need to do better than get into okay so yes ma'am so we're under this damned is pooping yes that is the six full purpose that is the reason that of the 490 years that they've got to come together is because they did all these hideous things against knowing what hey look even in the Old Testament like we were reading Wednesday night and chronicles doc knew they was going to do that I needed one know how to set but they weren't going to do that and they weren't good they were going to put up gods they were going to put up groves with idols beginning said I'm going to save you hey open offer that's right he gave him out to me they were God's bright they were the Old Testament riot I mean they were the bride of Jesus Christ and for the old customer time but he had to put him away and when he cleared away and she become a servant that's why the hunter point equals out and that's why I nikto we have to go through game 70 weeks anti-sexual purpose the movie byte didn't see full purpose but I said I want tied in with a sealed a little bit later on you have a question and just okay am i all right it is okay if I am feeling good we've got comes with a new week time to time to listen to the word a little bit y'all got see brother ray today I am it that's about how low your time did your duty raise your hand we had graduation ceremony for senior and I there's none it used to be above the knee dresses these early on mid thigh Lord that's long since the you ain't saying the ones above below the crotch sorry now the LA band / I have no idea don't worry strapless yeah I'm sorry wait isn't that I mean who the world is just it's insane i mean my heavens you can't talk you can't go you look at hey you wanna do I look at something don't look in a prom dress can graduation ain't nothing go to them some of those problem they once messages to kids into some of the mothers we're laying any brother brown said what flapper prostitute flapper streetwalker come Ronald down to your go where they get it from what I'm saying I can't after 13 years old wearing all right Thank You Elliot lay down don't mine too now that we have all this sex education class going home let's talk about 70 weeks name Amen all right yeah let me get off this for a little while all right listen get your brain on that's correct you sure turn on equity iniquity will continue on into blaspheming the holy go right that's why we have to repent every day I know I did something wrong yesterday I had a wrong call I know I did glad I could get forgive me but once but if I start letting that bad off continue and overcome me like it did before I didn't get the Holy Ghost I just got here 25 sanctified in that unclean spirit came back and I'm heading back in the other direction okay and you can't blaspheme the Holy Ghost listen if you got to hold so see my selling is if I have the Holy Ghost I can't blasting the whole goes but now I can commit an equity I can commit sin yeah I can do that and that's what that's why it is real and something I want to correct real quick thank you for bringing to my attention later I went back and watched least asked me about the 490 years i miss stated and I'm going to tell him everybody this evening about today morning doesn't end up here but when I said that Israel was in captivity for 70 years right three score and ten now I said they were really in captivity for native i miss stated that what i meant was the 70 years at least asked me afterward and i said i don't know i went back watch the whole thing what happened in that 70 years that they let the lan arrest was typing to 490 years cuz he there in bondage still from their freedom is only going to be right in here for the land and the people right the bari luys i had he asked he asked the question answer one wonderful i'm glad you did but i was working so fast and I told you for tonight they weren't in captivity wearing cap for 70 years but showing that the 490 years that they were coming out was hyped by that stable year because during a 70-year what happened to land rest and it was a jubilee for the land but what's going to happen right here at the end of the 490 years it's going to be a jubilee from the land so thank you very much I appreciate that because remember you asking me win tonight and you were a little bit confused not confused with had a question about why wait back home that night and watched it Callay when you get something like when someone asked a question you know it's like Rachel you know somebody said wolf why does she have to go you need to go check out you need to look for yourself if I say something here that that 445 bc is wednesday extend away started don't just agree with me and say well I guess that's what it is because he said no go back to this good luck actually will read it because brother Brad was that it started 45 bc but still I don't I don't take you for that either we should all you need yeah you need to listen to a profit but you gotta run through your filter right you gotta have your own holy ghost I'm not going I'm not I don't get a revelation cuz brother my brother ground go to Revelation right now tell a personal revelation now it's got a tie into that revelation that's what we're going to talk about today brother ground was revelation today in 70 weeks never changed let me tell you again hitting never change never he never changed his his revelation of Daniel 7 2 weeks now most of the message world says he did and what this is what come out of the ministers meeting several years ago was that Brenda Reynold tall in here that basically this whole book was wrong that he was confused well see that's why people leaving a message to things that they talk about is the cloud and dane 17 weeks that's the two topics that come up in 1977 well hope wins tonight you saw 1977 exactly my 1977 happened the way it did okay all right but they they don't deny that you never give them to say he was wrong but I asked him I said he preached 3 sermon put it in book form said thus says the Lord many times said the Holy Spirit Tony want to ride I said you're denying this whole book because what they're saying is is he caught down to 70 weeks in 1961 then when the seals broken 63 this was all wrong and God updated his revelation because what what they're contending is that yeah he did say and he did we're going to read it he said that the 70th week will happen after the broadleaf seven times in this book he tells us that that after the raft of the church is when the last week will happen then end to end seal bug somebody asked him that question he said no no no Nene night he sa I was wrong he said you misunderstood what I say in another work okay he said no is only three and a half years well well there's only three and half years left ok this is ministry there's always been a half years left and I want to show you something right here this is 1957 1957 before because my contention is if they if it's if it's in continuity with what the preacher from the message say is that if he was wrong here and he granted it in the seals okay then we must contend that that was wrong and anything active before that was wrong and then he come up with a new revelation in 63 of daniel said we come from track the whole mansion upcoming just 97 with okay watch right here 1957 is before 1961 this is when he starts preaching he somebody asked him a question will the Jews be saved after the bride leaves are right about that time what now believe it the Gentile Church this is 1957 questions and answers going he breathe now I believe is a Gentile Church will soon to complete completing of the body of Gentile Church the doors between Jesus said in Matthew 24 effect at one scripture from whence they will try down the walls in Jerusalem to attend college especially be finished know what it was given by Lord Jesus in Matthew 24 that the Jews will be taken out of the picture Dana stayed back over the old prophecy said there would be 70 of weeks yet allotted to the Jews and the Messiah would come the prince and would prophesy in the midst of a 70 of weeks weeks and say weeks and weeks now watch here's the tea here's the key to the whole thing that people do understand which was the seven years Daniel 70 weeks is not seven years it's 490 what year is he talking about there is no bible that jesus was cut off in the midst of the week that's no scripture find it scripture says he would st. jesus he can make the cover menu for one weekend in the midst of the week he'll call the sacrifice no place in the seat right here that's not Jesus and this is not Jesus ministry Jesus ministry what brother branham is doing listen the whole 70 weeks can be compressed into one week or seven years three and a half years of Jesus's ministry while he was here and three and a half years gives his ministry to the Jews so he was cut off in the middle of that week but not the middle this way because the Bible listened the Bible go back to the Bible the Bible said that when we left when the Covenant is made the road round can't be wrong but but here's my contention if he'd look if he's saying now that there's only three and half years with the prophesied in the midst of the 70 weeks which was the seven years he'd be cut off in the mid look how perfect that Jesus was exactly preach three and a half years he's going back to Jesus ministry and was crucified but there is three that come riding on this earth question here there's three and a half years yet allotted to them to the Jews it's got to be so now hold on a minute now you take this quote go all the way over to nineteen sixty Korean put it with what he said in the seals you say well he's saying the same thing but now have more confused now as the Prophet when he preached in this way contentiously I'm saying when he preached it this way this was only 39 years level then he comes up and preaches here that there seven years well Nene goes back preaches in 1953 at this tree and a half years web was he that confused we're going to continue this there's only three and a half years left of Jesus's ministry right the key for the website says the gym there three and a half years yet lauded to them but you got to remember go back to the six whole purpose 30 M is for the people and three of them is going to happen in the seventy weeks of Daniel but they have an after the battle born again you can't bring in everlasting righteousness and build the temple here and then destroy it and then have perfect harmony you know can't do that right so you can't put six photographs one day Tacoma he said read the sinkhole purpose understanding he said that will explain every bit of it and it did the central purpose to me explained and that's what brother Graham preached before he treats the 70th week of Daniel he preached gave Moses instruction to Daniel and then he creates 26 full purpose the six whole purpose will you will go by Rita a faux fur bus brother and whines it rather wear the number six is us entering the but we enter a temple here and then we have a battle of Armageddon to start all where's your Bible so I love love love one brother Brown said he says face final resting places in the word gun you got to put in here first and it brought around made this statement in 57 these statements in 61 we're going to read them there and then a different one is 63 then we do me do it for another problem we did he so confused no he's not he's talking about there was one minister they come up to me and that he said brother branham must be talking about a secret or an inside week that's true because you can condense all the Daniel 70 weeks to the Ministry of Jesus Christ through his self which we get we got that great heavier minister because he cut a lot he was cut off but not for himself French he'll come and destroy the city Titus disperse the Jews again right then in 1949 I started coming back right then you got a three and a half years ministry to bring out to finish transgression we can understand that reconciliation for iniquity this will be the same ministry of jesus christ that you and i are getting today you and I are now living under the Son of Man ministry so there's only when brother Brad watch he would prophesied in the midst of the 70th weeks not week he said we could have been right here this is the 70th week which was the seven years he condensed in you we won't read it today but in Daniel seventy weeks he says at about two more times he said 70 weeks that's seven years he condenses all to remember the seventy weeks of Daniel covers 490 years and there's a lot of things you plug in but come down to the very bottom line that three and a half year minutes Jesus Christ it's the whole key you can't get saved I style that three-and-a-half-year ministry Jesus Christ Geor Gentile so God blinded their eyes so the Gentiles could come in now he's got three and a half more years so he was he was cut off in the midst of that son of man ministry to my style week Isaiah 51 51 53 as he was cut off his generation was cut off he was killed look like mom said if you took the Gentiles out and didn't blind them you just pull it right together right here they have the Jews would have been there Jubilee afterwards if you pull them together but you got to separate them and put your gym columns in but you got to go by the Bible the Bible says that he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week who that's the Antichrist we do not see that coming at me we're already interactor for one week he makes that covenant then you got all these scriptures it's got to be fulfilled but there's only three and a half years of Jesus ministry level that's what brother branham he's peeing on every time after he preached this he preached this and broke it down to the people it is to the Jews this whole week is to the dude that's not to us we're gone we're out of here we're doing something else what are we doing you know me I really okay I mean Jesus has already got it settled for us and the reason I said okay it's not that I don't care what God has but he's already got it he's got it lined up for us there's no need for us to sit here in wonder what we're going to do what does it matter what does it matter what your future home house is going to life I don't dwell old man it was made back that theophany this inside of you hey man that's what it was made out of it was made out of that part that's in you right same thing yeah it's been on for a while even while you talking about all them sexy dresses and then so anyway we got my little things here but let you you got to have one week left to finish all those scriptures no watch right let's go through so you got that daniel said the 70 of weeks allotted to the Jews seventy seven seventy times seven 490 years okay but now what you said to Messiah would come to press and will promise on the midst of the 70th week know the Bible doesn't they will say that right it's ready to find it find it we're selling wasabi carving the middle of week and then 10 then it says after sixty two weeks than mice I'll be cut off and then he the prince that shall come will destroy the city in sanctuary I'm almost 40 verbatim now we've been over too many times and he verse 27 to confirm the coming of many for one week that's not Jesus that's not the Messiah it's Antichrist in the midst of the way he's going to cause the sacrifice an oblation to cease and I showed you the other day but Passover so there's three and a half years yet lighted to them to the Jews I believe that amen there's only three and a half years left to that elected and forty-four thousand that's going to be called out of Israel because remember when they go into rapture one more time there's no Holy Ghost on the earth that's why we gone that's my brother Ambrose of Great Tribulation the whole world is going to go through tribulation not justice not just a small one is going to happen around the world because remember this peace treaty that he signs at least for three and a half years Israel is going to be safe right it's what the treaty is it's a right if you'll do this we'll do that but inside that there's going to be two prophets preached the Son of Man ministry that we're getting right now okay to get the Holy Ghost and then they're going to go on a rap trouble on their out of here all hexagon Brinkley bell alarm again okay okay so what which was the seven years so if you'll take all the Daniel seventy weeks squeeze it down to seven years three and a half years of Jesus's ministry here you can see all night three and a half years Jesus ministry that he preached on earth while himself which we get the revelation of because we they were blinded the Jews but they were blinded so that we could get the revelation of it then you had a two thousand year gap right now where you're in that gap right now then he's going to come back and priest we're going to have more years because this indicated through two prophets our two witnesses Moses and Elijah preaching the same brother Brown said the same message this message is going to go over there okay so there's your stare sure seven years so Jesus with what he was coughing a mist of that seven years now when we get over to the seals that's what brother Brown was going to say he said no no you misunderstood he was caught up in the mess the week there's only three and a half years of Jesus's ministry lab well there's only three hundred years in that clip but there's one week left half of the right to the finish seventy weeks of Daniel code remember it's 25 people and this city to me that was the key you didn't say just to the people because Jesus only get I mean the Jews only get the three and a half your ministry of jesus christ the CD don't the Sun the city is going to be level right here remember the Bible says they going to drop a bomb right in the middle of Rome well then we go to destroy everything else you think they gonna leave you think Jerusalem is going to be safe I like knowing just going to be heathen Jews he's an Jews and Gentiles and everybody else so they got to rebuild the temple sometime in here I don't know why that really matter because it's not it's not for us today it's for the Jews today they're going to build a temple we're going to come back into that temple according to the sixth fold purpose is where the temple is anointed with our presence coming back in Revelations 19 riding back in the Millennium with us and 144,000 and the fifth fields you see you've got to see this is going to be a Jewish time that's why i was talking about wednesday night this is that you believe they've been looking for this is the jubilee that the Jews been looking for God told him 70 years i'm going to make that land rest i'm gonna get whether you like it or not in other words but then you try the 490 years into that 70 cuz remember seventy weeks from what Daniel was looking at is already finished it was finished back Daniel was in the 68 year of captivity two more years they went out but you gotta remember they didn't go out and was free they never been free who ruled Jerusalem when Jesus was that wrong how does a Roman 0 killed him and destroy them and put them on all over the place send them out into all them all over the world and then they started coming back during the World War that's what Hitler was so mad Hitler was killing Jews all the time cuz they had the money so so then you got all the six and a half million that were killed because they were Jews all right the end in 1949 they became a nation so you can really say from 49 till now is really the only time they have been free but have they been free no that's still in the captain they don't know Jesus Christ and the world is just the world is wanting to kill the whole town right don't tell you don't get your freedom is really when they go that temple this yield you comes up all that 144 Val and they see the Gentile come in that's when that Jubilees don't start this one said there's no can't be extended for a few blade can't go to 20 27 with 20 27 of being your 50th jubilee i'll be your 71st Jubilee I don't see it happen I just don't I just don't it nineteen forty nine to twenty nineteen years and seven year how about that how about that there was something else Louise brought to my attention win tonight he says come strange there your dad preached in 74 that that about that about the date you know from 74 to 77 it's three years and then here we are now speaking on on Daniel seventy weeks in 2016 looking at 2019 that's three more years so so God may be in a cycle here in ain t nana cycle he's trying to put us in one yeah yeah you don't need a cycle with us as human beings we need to have our brain jogged every once in a lot you know so all right everybody got them so this three and a half years allotted to them to the Jews it's got to be if I understand that that's the prophecy of the 1260 days of two prophets preaching the Ministry of Jesus Christ the Son of Man ministry right remember we preached on some man son of God yet all right we're living under the Son of Man ministry now but if we don't get a revelation that we're still under the Son of God revelation which is not bad it's about to his mother Holy Ghost and we get a revelation for our time but the son of man ministries the only thing it's going to take us in a rapture son of man ministries don't think gonna take them to my okay they're like to be killed we will have to be killed if we're the page we take a body change won't be all right Congrats gonna it's gonna be 2019 some two years old I write labs that have to spend they're not gonna give it a right hot right the only thing is they can't have the Holy Ghost now because that's my whole contingent you say well we got to use opening up the Holy Ghost and they're going to be the to Edison can't happen brother Brown says when the rapture happens everybody that has the Holy Ghost is going to leave so they don't have to get it right there afterwards though so have some way and it can begin a one we going after one man a very next day they can go with instra and receive the Holy Ghost and start preaching to them because you you know what they do they listen to it take make you listen to or whatever you know taking they get a message preached to them they finally little quick and everything that they need and then they'll take this message and take it on for 1260 days listen our website yes all right here we go now that is 1957 brother Brown says that Messiah would prophesied in the midst of the 70th weeks which was 27 years does everybody understand that but I want you to run off a copy of that thing you made you know the charge huh yep and we'll look at next Sunday because it's beautiful but everything is hinged on just seven years the 445 bc into bringing in and building the walls that's just a build-up to okay the jesus coming then all this other two thousand years is the build-up to this coming but there's only three and a half years is his ministry here over there that he preached himself then there's three and a half years of uses main street to the Jews that's your seven years and he was cut off in the middle of that week that Messiah wait you watch it will read it even into a silver he talks about massage my silence on one side he doesn't talk about the land and all this other things being built costs about my side well this is the only Messiah week there is left there's three and a half years over there three and half years here so if we brother Graham said he was caught up in the midst of the week he's telling you that there's seven year Ministry of Jesus Christ you can compress all that seventy weeks of Daniel into that one week if I got that yes if I got it got it got it though you either laughing it up any attention by big guy okay thank you alright so now let's go to that was 1957 now we're going to go to Gabriel construction to Daniel could not freeze up all right here we go now look this is gareth instructions to Daniel got the first book called the schedule instructions to Daniel six-fold purpose and then the 70th week there i got that this is Gables instructions to Danny mean got none for nothing Bravo revelation 61 revelation 19 21 it's connected with the 17 weeks what forever lesson 6 1 beginning of the seal listen to 60 literally opens during this time right here the two prophets go back d 6 they will start reading a steelbook because you see the sixth seal is these two prophets bringing fire bringing tornado earthquake whatever fire proceedeth out of their mouth stay open the students deal alright so for revelation 6 12 19 21 is connected with the 70 weeks now let me ask you a question revelation 6 1 starts to sealed revelations 1921 is what us riding back into the Millennium in 1921 or I started to read the whole Tiger the revelation 19 21 from 61 and 19 21 is connected with the 70 weeks now hold on a minute if I know it three and a half years left as most people say then we're going to ride back in the Millennium around here okay huh okay how therefore we must stop and explain before we go further we must stop and explain why these 70 of weeks because if you don't you'll miss the seals what you will be able to play some right because if you don't you miss those seals you missed the trumpets what the trumpets at all trumpets sound under the sixth seal which is the prophets how outstanding if you didn't get that you wouldn't know the one to trumpet sound they might understand that region still book read the face of the trumpets Brown said he preached on supernaturally in the sixth seal that all trumpets one through seven sound under the sixth seal which is right this is the message hmm which is message store that's correct too that's correct trumpet what is it trumpet what so I blow the horn you turning look you know and they said they sound a message one of them is retrieved one of them is charged because back then they didn't have cell phones in and walkie-talkies to let sound a trumpet to either charge or to retreat throw a trumpet what makes the sound you will miss the bowels and plagues three unclean spirits like frogs three whoa when does the third will happen go ahead third world war got it casting out of the red dragon woman in the Sun another woman in the Sun we know comes to Israel cops us too but comes to Israel because they hide her for three and a half years 1260 days they hide hurt they can't be key open till the end of that 1260 days right all right okay you'll miss it all if you don't cut the tape place right here in this 70th week what I just explained to you happens right here that's that last week that's why I told you they'll be more scripture fulfilled from right here to right here then then even when Jesus was on earth the district do you read that it takes place right here in this 70th week that's where it takes place right now go the National he comes up now to the six full purpose 64 Perkins no right here's part of your answer so Israel get it wrong to God and in this 70th week not this half week the 70th week what's going to happen God is going to finish the transgression of Israel finish the transgression will be turning away the ungodliness from Jacob and then all Israel will be born again now all Israel all Israel that's going to be safe 144,000 okay now all of them will receive the Holy Spirit finish the transgression transgressing against you is to do our own to you if you'll read a six-foot purpose you'll get your answer more clear maybe than I and I hit it okay but this is a 6-volt purpose in this 70th week what's going to happen God going to finish the transgression of Israel alright if I got that here we go again to the next one this is still gables and strut I mean six
