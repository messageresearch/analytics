[6:07] Revelations
[6:08] one that we've been reading 1 through
[6:13] three everybody had a big time I hope
[6:16] yesterday at the the yard sale they said
[6:18] he didn't make a lot of money but I
[6:20] guess they got a lot of talking done so
[6:23] that could be a lot fellowshipping okay
[6:27] Revelations 1 1-3 the revelation of
[6:30] Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to
[6:32] show unto his servants things which must
[6:34] shortly come to pass and he sent and
[6:37] signified it by his Angel and to his
[6:39] servant
[6:40] John who bear record of the word of God
[6:42] and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and
[6:44] of all things that he
[6:46] saw now remember the testimony of Jesus
[6:49] Christ remember that as we're in dealing
[6:51] with the fifth seal that they have their
[6:53] own testimony that's corre of staying
[6:55] with the word but not the testimony of
[6:58] Jesus Christ right blessed is he that
[7:01] reth and they that hear the words of
[7:02] this prophecy and keep those things
[7:04] which are written byin for the time is
[7:08] at hand amen right all right Revelations
[7:11] 69- 11 and when he had opened the fifth
[7:14] seal I saw on the altar The Souls of
[7:16] them which were slain for the word of
[7:18] God and for the testimony which they
[7:20] held see not the testimony of Jesus
[7:22] Christ testimony they hell and they
[7:24] cried with a loud voice saying how long
[7:26] oh Lord holy and true do thou not judge
[7:29] and avenge our blood on them that dwell
[7:31] on the earth and white robes were given
[7:33] unto every one of them and it was said
[7:35] unto them that they should rest for a
[7:37] little season until their fellow
[7:40] servants also and their bre Brethren
[7:43] that should be killed as they were
[7:45] should be fulfilled you may be seated
[7:48] the Lord at his Blessing to the reading
[7:50] of the
[7:52] word now I was trying to bring out a
[7:56] point our Wednesday night and the Lord
[7:59] begin to open up some
[8:01] more to me you know of what I was
[8:04] talking on and I just pray that the Lord
[8:07] would help me to be able to
[8:10] express what he's revealing to us amen
[8:13] now we know that the
[8:16] Bible is the complete Plan of Redemption
[8:18] amen that's right all right and so we
[8:21] read here that it is the revelation of
[8:24] Jesus Christ amen all right so then the
[8:28] the book itself being the Plan of
[8:30] Redemption and the revelation of Jesus
[8:34] Christ see then we are studying The Plan
[8:40] of Redemption amen now the Plan of
[8:44] Redemption right and remember now what
[8:47] we tried to
[8:49] express and all and this is what I I'll
[8:52] get back to in a little while and I just
[8:53] want to lay it down and then back up and
[8:56] do like I do a lot of times to make you
[8:57] to think
[8:59] that we have put a lot of emphasis upon
[9:02] the uh
[9:05] Redemption and we've dealt with it in a
[9:07] lot of ways as to Bringing out and we
[9:10] we've dealt with it as the
[9:13] uh The Plan of Redemption for
[9:16] salvation you know for the for the Bride
[9:19] of Jesus Christ we've dealt with Israel
[9:23] salvation in the Old Testament because
[9:25] they had one they had the bosom of
[9:28] Abraham the place to go that uh you know
[9:31] was related to the faith of Abraham and
[9:35] and they come when Jesus Christ came he
[9:38] come and paid the price
[9:40] right and would be able then to open up
[9:45] the uh Old Testament Saints you know
[9:48] bring them up with him yeah in the
[9:50] resurrection and things and uh go into
[9:53] the City and uh you know I don't claim
[9:58] to understand all of the things of
[10:00] redemption but I just want us to follow
[10:02] Redemption so then israels had their
[10:05] Redemptive plan as far as the Old
[10:07] Testament people they were not left out
[10:10] then the Gentile Bride Comes In which
[10:12] means Nations means anybody can come in
[10:15] right and a lot of the Jews came in to
[10:18] because it began basically on the day of
[10:20] Pentecost with Jews you know in the
[10:23] upper room and all and then it come
[10:26] turned into the
[10:27] Gentiles go Gentile just means Nations
[10:31] all right then we know that we've de
[10:36] we've dealt with and studied about even
[10:38] the foolish
[10:40] virgins and their Plan of Redemption and
[10:43] you know how that they will be given
[10:44] eternal life at the right Throne
[10:46] judgment all right and we've
[10:49] dealt for quite a while with the
[10:53] 144,000 to see their Redemptive plan and
[10:57] to see you know that they have a
[10:59] position a place and knowing where
[11:01] they're going to when they leave from
[11:03] here and you know that they will
[11:05] actually be in the millennial rain as
[11:07] Unix to the
[11:09] bride so we' we've tried to cover those
[11:13] things in doing it but we haven't spent
[11:16] much time on the uh fifth seal Jew and
[11:20] their Redemptive
[11:23] plan all right and I begin to see that
[11:25] open up more
[11:27] Wednesday than than I ever have you know
[11:29] and to to try to express it and to see
[11:33] what we need to understand because the
[11:37] I'll say this part of it and W can pick
[11:39] it up and bring it on into the U sixfold
[11:42] purpose one day maybe because see the
[11:45] fifth seal Jew must be also brought
[11:47] under that's correct the uh sixfold
[11:50] purpose that's right amen it's not just
[11:53] dealing with and I'll show you in a
[11:55] minute where the Prophet is reading it
[11:57] and I never noticed it even to be in the
[12:00] uh the Gabriel's instructions of what he
[12:03] was dealing with go we've always just
[12:05] basically made that um you know as to be
[12:08] the 144,000 right but it's not it goes
[12:12] into the Redemption of
[12:15] Israel of the fifth seal which is to be
[12:19] that group of people that was from
[12:22] Calvary down through and coming out into
[12:25] the end time you know when we go up then
[12:28] that Plan of Redemption will stop for
[12:31] them y right because then God will start
[12:34] dealing with the
[12:36] 144,000 all right now it might be
[12:39] surprisingly when we get through maybe
[12:42] some of it to to be able to try to
[12:45] express
[12:46] it but I'm just saying that we've we've
[12:49] dealt with those things but we haven't
[12:52] dealt with the
[12:54] uh part of the fifth seal Jew and that's
[12:58] what we're trying to do now is to see
[13:00] their Redemptive plan and you remember
[13:02] the statements that I've made that the
[13:06] the first four seals
[13:08] shows what this the the seals are not to
[13:10] the bride because they're after we leave
[13:13] out of here I hope that's beginning to
[13:15] click in your mind to to settle it we
[13:19] get the revelation of those things
[13:21] that's right amen all right we see where
[13:24] that that seal will go all the way back
[13:25] to Genesis and come all the way through
[13:28] the Bible but not be
[13:32] fulfilled until the time comes up
[13:34] because you remember how we were
[13:36] bringing out about the the fifth seal
[13:39] Jew the fifth seal Jew is actually uh
[13:43] her ceiling her bringing her forth her
[13:46] her being killed is during the church
[13:48] ages right amen but the prophet will say
[13:50] this is not during the church ages right
[13:53] he said because the the the ages is over
[13:56] with the brid are gone right but yet
[13:58] he's not saying that those fifth seal
[14:02] Jews are not placed in their
[14:05] position corre to be the souls under the
[14:08] altar yep all right and as it is then
[14:12] those Souls under the altar can cry how
[14:15] long but then it says white robes were
[14:18] given unto them all right now I believe
[14:24] that's where we're missing some of the
[14:25] part so we'll get back to it in a little
[14:28] while to to to get a little better
[14:30] understanding but let's just keep our
[14:32] thought going the way we're going right
[14:35] through who this group of people
[14:39] is and by looking at them you'd say well
[14:42] what has that got to do with
[14:44] us it's because we see the Plan of
[14:46] Redemption right right all right we see
[14:50] how they're redeemed we can see how
[14:52] we're redeemed we see how we're redeemed
[14:54] we can see how they're redeemed
[14:56] everything that's why the Bible made an
[14:59] outstanding statement there it says
[15:02] Jesus Christ died
[15:04] once for all it didn't say he died and
[15:08] then he has to come back again and die
[15:09] again and and this out of the other it
[15:12] said he died once all right in him is
[15:16] the complete Plan of Redemption right
[15:19] amen right whether it be the Old
[15:21] Testament
[15:22] Saints they're dependent upon who he was
[15:27] all right you know because of Salvation
[15:29] is dependent upon Jesus Christ amen the
[15:33] bride is dependent her salvation is
[15:35] dependent upon Jesus Christ all right
[15:39] now then the the foolish virgin is
[15:41] dependent you know Upon Jesus
[15:45] Christ and then the 144,000 is dependent
[15:49] upon Jesus Christ all right so the fal
[15:52] Jew her her Plan of Redemption is
[15:55] dependent upon Jesus Christ it is not
[15:59] some other halfhazard form or whatever
[16:02] just something happened along the way
[16:05] that uh would give them
[16:07] salvation no matter whether they
[16:09] believed it or
[16:12] not it is dependent upon that right in
[16:16] the Old Testament they did not know
[16:18] about Jesus Christ
[16:20] right but their salvation is dependent
[16:23] upon whether or not he was that God that
[16:28] the word has spoke of that's right now
[16:30] surely they believed in the God and they
[16:33] believed in their Redemptive plan is
[16:35] being evolving around that
[16:38] God but they killed that God when he
[16:41] came see because they couldn't
[16:43] understand all
[16:45] right then truly if we look at it all
[16:48] salvation is based upon Jesus Christ yes
[16:52] amen so now if you hear me coming
[16:54] through the message in a little bit and
[16:56] it looks like I'm leaning over a little
[16:58] just just remember I'm not
[17:00] leaning I'm trying to
[17:03] explain but not lean but stay with the
[17:06] word amen all right see then that way we
[17:08] can understand the Plan of Redemption
[17:12] right because all Redemption is related
[17:15] together right no matter that's what I'm
[17:18] trying to get to point to you no matter
[17:20] where it would be an Old Testament say
[17:22] the bride the foolish virgins the
[17:24] 144,000 the fal Jew or
[17:27] whatever it's based upon and got to have
[17:31] a Plan of
[17:33] Redemption to where we can see it and
[17:36] then to see how that they so Lac
[17:39] together right until we talk about the
[17:41] fifth FAL
[17:43] Jew one day be given eternal
[17:47] life all
[17:49] right not because they want it
[17:53] right but because God said it right
[17:57] trying to get to to to you and I like
[17:59] the prophet said the word is what is
[18:03] right right all right and if whatever
[18:07] God says we can't argue with it of
[18:10] course we do because of the carnalities
[18:13] of our
[18:15] mind but yet who are
[18:19] we if the prophet said it in the Bible
[18:22] said it then where do we have any right
[18:24] to think or say anything else that's
[18:27] right right right because see that would
[18:29] make us the prophet
[18:32] right that would make us the one to
[18:34] bring the message all right you see
[18:37] church that's not that way all right now
[18:41] so remember
[18:44] now we get the revelation of the Plan of
[18:50] Redemption right that goes all the way
[18:53] back to Genesis even really goes back up
[18:55] into heaven cuz Christ Min God reveal
[18:59] is a great message for the prophet he
[19:00] said let's go back in the back part of
[19:02] God's mind so he went all the way back
[19:04] up into heaven and brought it down to
[19:07] where we're at see then we can stand
[19:09] here still in Mortal bodies dying
[19:13] decaying you know rotting away getting
[19:16] older and yet be able to look
[19:20] back into
[19:22] eternity and see what was there by way
[19:25] of the Prophet right and then be able to
[19:27] look for
[19:28] forward all the way into eternity the
[19:32] future home and the thing and that's
[19:34] still standing here right amen that
[19:37] ought to make us the most happiest
[19:39] people in the world if it's not even
[19:42] revealed if it's just the fact that we
[19:45] can say it that's right it order to make
[19:48] us the happiest people in the world to
[19:50] be able to understand the
[19:52] Bible That's Right amen and what it's
[19:54] saying right sir right the word of this
[19:58] the most beautiful thing that could ever
[20:01] be and once it's put into
[20:04] place there's no
[20:06] problem but yet until it's revealed to
[20:09] us we argue it that's
[20:12] right because we don't understand it see
[20:15] there's no writings check your your
[20:18] thing there's no writings about this
[20:20] fifth seal Jew
[20:22] right you know now I'm sure people spoke
[20:25] of it and all but I mean you got
[20:27] writings of about all the other things
[20:30] of the
[20:32] Redemption but yet you have no one being
[20:34] able to speak on these
[20:36] things but I hope in a minute that
[20:38] you'll see what I was trying to bring
[20:40] Wednesday that you know the Apostle Paul
[20:43] wants it unveil from his eyes and
[20:47] remember now he said he saw
[20:51] things that he was not able to talk
[20:54] about
[20:56] right but where would he get get there's
[20:58] such a statement to make that we'll get
[21:00] to in a
[21:02] minute where he would be standing
[21:06] there persecuted and everything by the
[21:09] Jews and you know the Israelites as we
[21:11] call them but yet he would make a
[21:14] outstanding statement he
[21:16] said all Israel shall be
[21:22] saved now where did he get
[21:26] that man emphasize a statement brother B
[21:30] made and let you think on this idea and
[21:32] then you'll see that the seals are broke
[21:34] to the bride of Christ
[21:37] right brother BR said one day he said
[21:40] that one of the seals opened up and John
[21:42] saw his
[21:44] name right and he said have you seen
[21:47] your name in the book that's right by
[21:50] the opening of the
[21:53] seals as the seals revealed Jesus Christ
[21:56] to you
[21:58] right have they revealed The Plan of
[22:01] Redemption to you right come
[22:05] on would there be any problem to even
[22:08] think and say that God allowed Paul for
[22:12] that to just open up right to him in his
[22:15] day and him look right down and see this
[22:18] fifth sealed
[22:23] Jew and see Israel
[22:25] saved as a nation right right right yep
[22:29] then you'll understand what I was
[22:31] getting
[22:33] at those two
[22:35] witnesses those Jews
[22:39] 144,000 see the Plan of Redemption and
[22:41] see they've missed it but see the
[22:44] sunship that is that is for the bride of
[22:47] Christ the beautiful thing they turn
[22:50] down but yet see that God has finished
[22:53] their transgression right and made an
[22:56] end to their sin that's right
[22:59] and brought them into a place they're
[23:01] not going to be mad because that they
[23:03] servants to the
[23:05] bride they will rejoice amen
[23:12] amen but just
[23:15] think when that opens to
[23:18] them they
[23:20] see this fifth seal
[23:24] youw that God has
[23:26] given
[23:29] Redemption to their people y not just
[23:33] them no that's
[23:36] right but he's given it to Israel right
[23:39] not every Israelite we'll get in a
[23:41] minute just read it where the Prophet
[23:42] will say it
[23:45] right all Israel is not Israel right man
[23:50] all Jews Better Way saying are not
[23:51] Israel that's right all Israel is Israel
[23:56] when you really get down to the word
[23:57] Israel
[23:59] but think on that
[24:00] point and you'll see what I'm driving at
[24:03] that I'm trying to get us to see the
[24:05] Plan of Redemption for ourselves how
[24:07] much could it be a greater message of
[24:11] Grace when we would realize and say
[24:13] grace is unmerited favor
[24:16] amen an unmar favor to Israel we see it
[24:20] even though they crucified him and said
[24:24] let his blood be on us you said now wait
[24:28] a minute it wasn't that group of people
[24:30] outside that that day with
[24:32] Jesus I'm glad you thought of
[24:35] that because if you going to take that
[24:38] route then I'll take a route with
[24:40] you I didn't have anything to do with
[24:43] Even Adam in the garden so I'm
[24:47] sinless
[24:50] uhoh you got caught out in the open
[24:52] didn't you right we know that Adam and
[24:55] Eve in the garden represented us us and
[24:58] made us into the point of being lost
[25:02] amen and no hopes whatsoever we didn't
[25:06] have to be back gued for that to be that
[25:12] way so is it with
[25:15] Israel those people as I said they were
[25:17] even so blinded until in that group
[25:20] standing there was probably some of the
[25:22] people that finally gave their lives and
[25:24] would be this fifth sealed Jew was
[25:26] standing there that was crying out let
[25:28] his blood be on us right CU they were
[25:30] blinded right
[25:32] right that's where we try to make little
[25:35] things to fit our personal
[25:37] thoughts or ideas
[25:40] of the
[25:42] Bible but then it won't line up after
[25:44] you try to bring it down through the
[25:45] correct
[25:47] way cuz I hope you understand what I'm
[25:50] saying yes I try to take something like
[25:52] that to prove a
[25:54] point do you say no no it wasn't that
[25:57] group of people people well I don't have
[25:59] to be blamed for what what he's done in
[26:01] the garden
[26:02] then so you're denying the word of God
[26:06] trying to make some point of her own for
[26:08] a thought right sit back and listen and
[26:12] try to
[26:14] understand because we're going to get
[26:16] out of
[26:17] here when this Plan of Redemption is
[26:20] completed to you and
[26:24] I then we'll see as we'll read in the
[26:27] scripture
[26:28] then out of Zion the Bible speaks of the
[26:31] a deliverer coming to
[26:33] Zion all right that's the bride it comes
[26:35] from B gar over to the Jews over to the
[26:38] Gentiles that'll come from out of Zion
[26:42] right amen then we know that Zion
[26:44] represents the
[26:46] bride and see then the Bible says out of
[26:49] Zion will come a deliverer we'll read in
[26:51] a minute who far for Israel right this
[26:55] message is going to Israel
[26:58] to deliver
[27:00] them after we get out of here so we have
[27:03] a great key point to to be dealing
[27:06] with cuz without us they cannot be made
[27:10] perfect
[27:12] amen we put that to this other things
[27:15] but why not put it on to the rest as I
[27:18] said if we don't fight this battle of
[27:19] Armageddon spiritually speaking and win
[27:22] the battle over Satan and the mind there
[27:24] won't be no literal battle of Armageddon
[27:26] right
[27:28] there won't be no time of anything like
[27:30] that because he would defeat us if he
[27:32] defeats us right then he's
[27:35] defeated God himself right
[27:38] righten right think on these things
[27:42] that's
[27:44] right but think about it now look even
[27:47] these even now watch light had not
[27:52] shined on these scriptures that's what
[27:54] I'm trying to get you to see right you
[27:57] know understand light in other words it
[27:58] was written but light had not shined
[28:01] that's
[28:02] right the prophet when he saw the the
[28:05] great vision and the things you know and
[28:07] the or the man did which way it is
[28:09] whipped off the tot and looked down in
[28:11] there he saw these things he went West
[28:14] and come back and preached the Seven
[28:16] Seals The Plan of Redemption that light
[28:19] had not shined upon but truly this is
[28:22] one thing that we see we talk about the
[28:25] the Mysteries Paul would speak a lot of
[28:27] about Mysteries and he says that the The
[28:30] Mystery of the engrafting of the
[28:33] Gentiles right and that's a great
[28:36] understanding amen of how that there was
[28:38] a group of people to receive eternal
[28:40] life that would not be the chosen
[28:43] Israelite you know or Jew right but
[28:47] would even be Gentiles dogs right but
[28:51] yet it's a
[28:53] mystery and then look back and we can
[28:55] see tops and shadows of you know Ruth
[28:59] and Boaz and you know Rahab the Harlot
[29:03] coming into the lineages and the
[29:05] things and we can see and say well the
[29:07] Gentiles were spoke
[29:10] of and on this fifth seal there's hardly
[29:12] anything whatsoever that was even spoke
[29:15] of because we didn't realize what Paul
[29:17] was saying right when he said all Israel
[29:20] shall be
[29:22] saved we argued well does that mean this
[29:25] or does that mean that or does that mean
[29:26] this
[29:29] it means exactly what he
[29:32] said all the chosen
[29:34] predestinated will be saved brother R
[29:38] says those that had their name on the
[29:40] lounge Book of Life and it remained
[29:45] amen then we can get into invisible
[29:48] Union and understand that there can
[29:50] be a transferring of names right
[29:55] right that Israel could have her name
[29:57] name still left in the book but not go
[30:00] into the Eternal section of the book
[30:01] until she receives eternal life
[30:04] right then she will realize
[30:08] Redemption but looking at them and
[30:10] seeing ourselves what is the greatest
[30:13] message of Grace it could ever be that
[30:15] God would save a group of people that
[30:16] don't want it
[30:19] right then you'll see that it's Grace
[30:22] for you and I
[30:24] right think on these things as we go
[30:26] along let's go ahead and
[30:28] you know this was even closed up so much
[30:30] until the
[30:31] prophet of God he didn't see those seals
[30:34] until 63 right right
[30:37] amen all right this mystery of
[30:40] redemption was sealed up even after even
[30:43] though he preached 1 2 3 and four
[30:47] sure ab and brought in the Journey of
[30:50] the Antichrist and the things Y and even
[30:52] curries it to death and CES it to the
[30:54] white thr judgment and the rejection
[30:57] into the things
[30:59] right and yet he says the Lord had to
[31:02] speak to him that morning because see he
[31:04] thought her that day
[31:05] right he thought this was the martyred
[31:09] right Saints amen all right so let's
[31:13] start right there go ahead brother look
[31:15] number one this is paragraph
[31:18] 215 of the fifth
[31:21] seal notice now the ninth verse sold
[31:23] under the altar now here's where I'm
[31:25] going to get some real disagreement
[31:28] but just watch just a minute just see I
[31:32] thought that too y but it didn't come
[31:35] out didn't come that way amen we I've
[31:38] always thought that these Souls under
[31:40] the altar were the martyrs of the early
[31:43] church
[31:44] yep that's what he thought sure and I'm
[31:47] sure that Dr U Smith and every one of
[31:49] them says it and all and I thought so
[31:51] myself but when the Holy Spirit showed
[31:53] the vision to it it wasn't it it isn't
[31:56] the soul it's not the Marty n right he
[32:01] said show
[32:03] division so he saw this and without even
[32:06] just to say a MH a thought coming to him
[32:11] right he said he saw the vision amen
[32:15] look at the next one now which is a
[32:17] continuation of reading
[32:19] but this is paragraph
[32:22] 28 now for they at this time if you
[32:25] notice this fifth seal being opened see
[32:27] the church is gone it just can't be the
[32:29] sold under the the early church now now
[32:32] please if you ever did give this
[32:35] attention now cuz this is a great
[32:38] controversy so I want you to listen real
[32:40] close now and you got your papers and
[32:42] things to write them now I want you to
[32:44] notice now these cannot be them Souls
[32:47] because the souls of of the righteous
[32:49] martyr and the rightous people the
[32:51] church the bride has done been took up
[32:55] so they wouldn't be under the
[32:59] altar they'd be in glory with the bride
[33:02] now watch for they are gone in the
[33:04] Rapture in the fourth chapter of
[33:06] Revelation they was taken up now who are
[33:09] these Souls then see that's the next
[33:12] thing who are they that they if they are
[33:16] not the early
[33:17] church who is it then this is Israel
[33:20] that's to be saved as a
[33:23] nation all of them that are
[33:25] predestinated that's Israel that's
[33:28] Israel itself you say oh wait a minute
[33:32] see people to argue with it y but it's
[33:35] Israel to be saved as a
[33:38] nation it is not talking about the
[33:43] 144,000 it is not talking about the
[33:46] Israel of the Old Testament because they
[33:49] have their Plan of Redemption right amen
[33:52] it is talking about those killed
[33:55] from Calvary
[33:58] mhm up until now right that were blinded
[34:02] amen I know people don't like that part
[34:04] either they don't like that they want to
[34:06] make some form of blinded they they
[34:08] don't understand what I'm getting
[34:11] at they say well they blinded
[34:13] theirselves no you blind yourself you
[34:16] lost that's right amen I hope people get
[34:19] that
[34:21] idea right those Jews those people that
[34:25] blinded them
[34:27] yeah are not the chosen of Israel right
[34:32] amen those that blinded the people back
[34:38] there can't claim this point
[34:42] of
[34:45] Israel cuz they
[34:47] blinded all
[34:49] right but you
[34:53] see they were blinded for you and I
[34:56] right
[34:57] amen amen if they were not blinded
[35:00] salvation would not have come to you and
[35:06] I but it's all right brother D but I
[35:09] just don't like the point of of you
[35:11] saying God blinded them well Who blinded
[35:13] them come on now amen that's right well
[35:17] they blinded yourself I just covered
[35:19] that you blind yourself you got a
[35:20] problem right amen
[35:23] right but think about it
[35:28] God is the only one that can blind
[35:30] anybody that's right right no no no the
[35:33] devil blinded
[35:35] people I thought we understood that but
[35:40] I thought we
[35:41] understood that God permitted him to do
[35:45] what he
[35:47] done come
[35:49] on you say well now all right you go on
[35:53] with your blindness then all
[35:55] right you calling me blind brother Dale
[35:58] no I'm not calling you blind you're
[35:59] calling your own self blind
[36:02] right the understand because that's is
[36:04] what I've always
[36:08] preached people who blind themselves are
[36:11] lost right right amen but when God came
[36:15] the way he
[36:17] came your Prophet said it blinded
[36:22] them
[36:24] right now I covered it Wednesday night
[36:26] that if the foolish
[36:30] virgin truly you have to say that she's
[36:32] blind to the
[36:35] truth then God don't destroy her
[36:40] right he gives her eternal life one day
[36:43] that's right amen that's right so he can
[36:46] deal with Israel see the Plan of
[36:48] Redemption so what did he
[36:51] say this is the Israel to be saved as a
[36:55] nation go with number
[37:00] three the last Gentile bride to be
[37:04] brought in for the bride the bride the
[37:06] blindness come to Israel for that
[37:08] purpose for so all Israel shall be saved
[37:12] and is it written there shall come out a
[37:14] design of deliver and shall turn away
[37:16] ungodliness from
[37:17] Jacob now you you'll see it in a minute
[37:20] that'll coveres right on the end of that
[37:21] six-fold
[37:22] purpose right now they are Israel that's
[37:24] under the altar what Israel was blinded
[37:27] for the very purpose of us being saved
[37:29] you believe that now Who blinded them
[37:32] God God blinded his own children that's
[37:36] right all right now I'm not talking
[37:39] about everybody that's
[37:41] blind right I Do cover that right we're
[37:43] only talking about the F seal Jew that's
[37:45] blind we ain't talking about Gentiles
[37:47] that are blind or who's blind we're
[37:48] talking about this group of
[37:52] people let be blind all right now watch
[37:56] the next
[37:58] one
[38:00] 227 no wonder Jesus standing there at
[38:03] the
[38:03] cross look and then Jews howling for his
[38:07] blood that was his own kids y look what
[38:11] he
[38:11] covered and he was the scripture you
[38:15] understand what he's
[38:16] meaning he knew what was going on right
[38:20] you see what the prophet is say in other
[38:22] words he's the word he he knows what's
[38:24] going on he knows what them people's
[38:27] doing
[38:29] yes right but he knows also what he's
[38:32] going to
[38:33] do right right come on and he was the
[38:37] scripture he was himself the word and
[38:40] here he knowing that those people would
[38:43] have gladly received him and that's the
[38:46] reason he blinded them right so that
[38:48] they wouldn't recognize
[38:51] him
[38:54] y now
[38:59] you better get into the thought of what
[39:01] we're trying to
[39:04] bring because if those people would have
[39:07] gladly received him right and he done
[39:11] anything to keep them from receiving
[39:18] him he can't judge them
[39:21] Noe sure not
[39:25] man
[39:27] mhm
[39:28] Y and he would be overriding your freeo
[39:31] agency y That's it because they would
[39:34] want to be saved now that's what he said
[39:36] come on you just talk to talk to God and
[39:38] the prophet don't argue with me about it
[39:40] I don't have time fool with
[39:45] you he blinded them so they wouldn't
[39:48] recognize him once he come in such an
[39:51] humble way and blinded them to it
[39:54] y that they wouldn't receive it you see
[39:56] they already they had it figured out he
[39:58] going to come riding in on some great
[39:59] warrior you know going to kill them
[40:01] Romans and take over and and all this at
[40:04] the other you know or he was going to
[40:06] come down and they'd be a carpet rolled
[40:08] all the way right up to cus the high
[40:10] priest he'd walk up and oh cus you
[40:12] stayed with the word I come to you since
[40:15] doing that he's born as a baby amen
[40:18] exactly the way the Bible said he would
[40:22] come that's right now is the prophet
[40:26] saying anything wrong
[40:28] no he come in such an humble
[40:32] way he said well well that's what
[40:34] blinded the people because it's
[40:38] so they was reading the word they knew
[40:42] the Messiah was to be born right MH
[40:47] Isaiah 9:6 said so
[40:50] y yep
[40:53] right but you see they had it figured
[40:55] out
[40:57] right could that be you and me right
[41:01] brother there I think it's just a way oh
[41:04] good Constitution permits that Bible
[41:12] don't but you see what he's saying yes
[41:16] they would have received him that's
[41:18] right so he had to do something
[41:21] mhm that's right well no he just comeing
[41:24] on boy
[41:30] yeah why is it that we'll get to it in a
[41:33] minute that the Bible says they had eyes
[41:35] and can't
[41:36] see ears and can't
[41:39] hear
[41:43] right right come on
[41:46] Church Jesus pied them in so much as he
[41:52] said father forgive them yeah
[41:56] they don't know what they're doing they
[41:59] were blind Paul said they were blinded
[42:01] for a cause for
[42:04] us Jesus said father forgive
[42:07] them
[42:09] now that would be applied to everybody
[42:12] that was standing there if they
[42:17] had the right
[42:19] attitude but the wrong attitude made a
[42:22] lot of people standing
[42:24] there yep that'll never never be saved
[42:27] amen that's
[42:28] right cuz they blinded
[42:33] themselves the prophet of God you
[42:35] remember what we bringing out Wednesday
[42:36] the foolish virgins in the seal book
[42:38] what did he say those who never heard
[42:40] the
[42:41] message right are those who were blinded
[42:44] by false Shepherds amen preachers in
[42:47] this message in other words that's right
[42:49] amen is blinded the people to the truth
[42:52] y
[42:54] right now if I do that deliberately I go
[42:57] to hell right
[42:58] amen that's right but you be blind you
[43:01] might make it to heaven right yep do you
[43:04] see where I stand and where I preach
[43:06] that's
[43:07] right but
[43:12] look they were blinded Paul said they
[43:15] were blinded let's go to the scripture
[43:17] now and just read
[43:20] it and we're going to basically read the
[43:22] entire 11
[43:25] chapter but I want you to think about
[43:27] it and think about what I said there a
[43:30] moment
[43:31] ago God opened Paul's
[43:37] eyes you know
[43:41] why why did God give wisdom
[43:45] to
[43:47] Solomon that's it
[43:50] amen and remember wisdom is different
[43:52] than understanding and knowledge right
[43:53] remember I might do the message with it
[43:56] why did he give him
[43:58] wisdom because he asked him for a
[44:03] way to lead his people amen right so he
[44:08] gave him wisdom to know how to lead his
[44:11] people Paul said I would be a cast away
[44:15] if it were possible for my
[44:18] people the Bible say about Isaiah stand
[44:22] us continually pleading
[44:25] see right
[44:28] right anybody that's ever had salvation
[44:30] wants to deliver to somebody else right
[44:33] like I've always told you salvation is
[44:34] the only thing I want to give
[44:37] away yep I want to give it to you
[44:41] amen but how many preachers would be a
[44:44] cast away for their own people brother
[44:48] right you can see what they're doing
[44:50] today we'll get off
[44:54] that look what Paul said 13th 11th
[44:57] chapter of Romans 13th verse we're going
[44:59] to go way down now so we're going to
[45:02] read we're going to see if Paul really
[45:04] saw
[45:07] something so went right in there and
[45:09] spoke of it for I speak to you Gentiles
[45:14] in so much as I am the Apostle of the
[45:15] Gentiles I magnify my
[45:20] office if by any means I may provoke to
[45:23] emulation you know stir them up
[45:26] them which are my flesh and might save
[45:30] son of them some of
[45:32] them I speak to you
[45:36] Gentiles remember he went to the Jews
[45:41] right that's right but they wouldn't
[45:44] have Paul that's right
[45:46] y right but he said lo I turned to the
[45:50] Gentiles right God said through the man
[45:53] there said I'm going to show him what
[45:56] he's going to suffer from me y I'm going
[45:59] to send him to the dogs that he's
[46:01] been so much against all of his life I'm
[46:05] going to send him to the Gentiles with
[46:07] salvation y I'm not even going to let
[46:10] him go to my
[46:13] people y I'm going to send him to the
[46:19] dogs Paul was speaking about I preach to
[46:21] you dogs I preach to you gentille to try
[46:24] to bring you in
[46:28] try to stir you
[46:30] up but his mind was on his
[46:36] people he wanted to see his people
[46:40] sa right
[46:43] sure and was he wanting to see him saved
[46:46] as just individuals to come into the
[46:48] body of Christ why didn't he stay with
[46:49] the
[46:54] Jews
[46:56] no he wanted to save his
[47:00] people the nation of
[47:06] Israel he wanted salvation for his
[47:09] people what about
[47:12] you if by any means I may provoke to
[47:15] emulation them which are my flesh you
[47:18] talking about Jews right Israel and may
[47:22] might save some of them and he did right
[47:25] some of them came into the body of
[47:27] Christ to be there but what about the
[47:29] rest of them now let's cover
[47:31] that for if the casting away of them be
[47:34] the reconciling of the world remember
[47:36] what we read the prophet said he blinded
[47:39] them for we for we could come in right
[47:43] look or if the casting away of them what
[47:46] the Jews be the reconciling of the world
[47:48] what shall the receiveing of them
[47:51] be but life from the dead
[47:54] mhm well won't will it be they'll come
[47:56] to it one day y for if the first fruit
[47:59] be holy yep remember we are not the
[48:02] first
[48:03] fruit Israel is the first frot amen we
[48:07] are not the root Israel is the
[48:11] root we're grafted in right right all
[48:15] right
[48:16] y for if the first fruit be holy the
[48:18] lump is also holy and if the root be
[48:21] holy so are the
[48:23] branches why because the root is
[48:26] Holy right come
[48:30] on the tree brother Ram saw that all
[48:33] kind of things on it said will it ever
[48:36] put forth
[48:38] another Orange He said yes but it'll
[48:42] have to be from the original
[48:45] root right come
[48:49] on and if some of the branches be broken
[48:52] off
[48:53] right and thou being a wild Olive Tree
[48:56] were grafted in among them and with them
[48:59] partakers of the root and the fatness of
[49:01] the Olive Tree so our BAS is upon Jewish
[49:05] this is Jewish roots this is not Gentile
[49:06] Roots boast not against the branches but
[49:10] if thou boast thou bearest not the root
[49:13] but the root
[49:16] thee all
[49:18] right thou W say then mhm the branches
[49:21] were broken off that I might be GR in
[49:27] right well because of unbelief they were
[49:31] broken off and thou standest by faith be
[49:35] not high minded but fear in other words
[49:37] don't build yourself up too good you
[49:39] know
[49:42] folks for if God Spar not the natural
[49:45] branches take heed lest he also spare
[49:48] not thee behold therefore the goodness
[49:51] and sovereignty of
[49:53] God on them which
[49:56] which
[49:57] fail
[49:59] listen the
[50:01] goodness and the
[50:05] nature the servant which would go to
[50:07] Servant Hood the
[50:10] understanding how great God
[50:14] is on them which fail y who he talking
[50:18] about
[50:21] Jews
[50:23] servant but toward word thee good
[50:26] if thou continue in goodness right
[50:29] otherwise Thou shalt be cut
[50:32] off
[50:34] right and they also if they abide not
[50:37] still in
[50:39] unbelief shall be grafted in that's
[50:45] right you remember there's a covering
[50:47] over their heart but Paul says that one
[50:50] day that'll be taken away that they'll
[50:54] see but God is able to graft them in
[50:57] again
[50:59] right he hasn't forgotten
[51:02] Israel or if th were cut off cut out of
[51:05] the Olive Tree which is Wild by nature
[51:08] and work grafted contrary to Nature to a
[51:10] good Olive Tree see in other words what
[51:12] you do you don't you you take a a wild
[51:15] Olive Tree you take the Wild and you
[51:17] graft into if you're going to try to
[51:19] hybrid it and bring it up and do the
[51:21] thing you take a wild Olive roots and
[51:24] you you Graft in the T into
[51:26] it right a good one but it's not so with
[51:33] God I were cut off cut out of the Olive
[51:37] Tree which is Wild by nature and work
[51:40] grafted contrary to Nature into a good
[51:42] Olive
[51:43] Tree how much more shall these which be
[51:47] the natural Banes be grafted into their
[51:50] own olive tree right future event amen
[51:54] right m mhm for I would not Brethren
[51:57] that you should be ignorant of this
[51:59] mystery
[52:02] y let you should be wise in your own
[52:06] conceits that blindness in part has
[52:08] happened to Israel until the fullness of
[52:11] the Gentiles become in you feel still
[52:14] Jew come
[52:15] on and so all Israel shall be
[52:20] saved now I've got it in here so don't
[52:22] worry about it not ever Israelite
[52:28] right but the chosen of Israel that's
[52:31] right amen so all Israel shall be saved
[52:34] now that's a bold statement what are you
[52:37] talking about
[52:39] Paul I'm talking about all of the chosen
[52:42] of Israel right the predestinated let me
[52:45] I'm quoting brother brandom for
[52:47] references in later in the quotes the
[52:50] ones whose names remain on the
[52:54] book
[52:57] the natural nation of
[53:01] Israel is where these people come from
[53:03] and here they are yeah but brother Dale
[53:06] you said it you taught us that yes they
[53:08] will the natural nation of Israel
[53:12] amen will not be saved in the
[53:16] tribulation
[53:17] period That's Right none of them will be
[53:21] saved in the tribulation right of the
[53:24] natural nation of is Israel the
[53:28] 144,000 will come out of Israel yes
[53:32] right right that's the part to be saved
[53:35] come on get it all
[53:38] right and so all Israel shall be saved
[53:42] as it is
[53:45] written
[53:47] yeah let spoke of in the scriptures yep
[53:50] you got your Bible to over to the side
[53:52] of and they'll tell you where that's
[53:53] coming from mhm
[53:56] I think it's Isaiah isn't
[53:58] it so all Israel shall be saved even as
[54:01] it is written there shall come out of
[54:03] Zion the deliver and that scripture says
[54:05] come to Zion right over there I think
[54:07] it's in Isaiah isn't it the deliver and
[54:10] she'll turn away ungodliness from
[54:12] Jacob it was spoke up in the Old
[54:14] Testament what this was going to
[54:16] be and this is my
[54:21] Covenant come
[54:24] on
[54:26] Isaiah
[54:29] 59 for this is my Covenant unto
[54:33] them when I shall take away their
[54:37] sins amen amen there's your sixfold per
[54:41] amen all right now we're going to read
[54:43] where brother R puts that in there in a
[54:44] minute now so don't just think this is
[54:46] just me
[54:49] talking but
[54:51] look a covenant with them amen
[54:59] I thought we
[55:03] believed God gave
[55:06] Abraham an unconditional
[55:12] Covenant is not Abraham the father of
[55:15] the Jews or Israelites true Israel is
[55:20] really the way of saying it
[55:24] right cuz he was the first one called a
[55:28] Hebrew because it means one from the
[55:30] other side of the
[55:32] river and the Bible said I brought your
[55:35] father Abraham from the other side of
[55:37] the
[55:38] flood so he really was a good Hebrew
[55:41] that's
[55:42] right they give it to him because they
[55:44] saw him cross the river come walking
[55:45] toward him oh your name is Abraham
[55:47] you're a Hebrew you just crossed the
[55:50] river the Bible said I brought him from
[55:52] the other side of the flood yep
[55:58] amen so I thought Abraham was to have an
[56:00] unconditional
[56:03] Covenant oh brother you're walking
[56:05] inside I love
[56:10] it because when I can walk in that word
[56:13] I don't have to
[56:16] worry every Israelite will never be
[56:18] saved no way that's right but every true
[56:22] Israelite that is a
[56:28] Covenant right Israelite
[56:32] amen will one day be
[56:36] saved and folks I thought that we
[56:40] believe that we were the Seed of Abraham
[56:43] by faith right and I
[56:48] thought that we didn't have anything to
[56:51] do with our Salvation come
[56:53] on I thought that's the way we believed
[56:58] it well but brother d i right that's
[57:00] what you've
[57:01] done but the Bible said no man sought
[57:05] God and your Prophet told us we didn't
[57:08] that's the Bible said the goodness of
[57:10] God is what leadth the to
[57:15] repentance oh you're getting into
[57:18] Redemption that's you
[57:21] around we seeing that Paul spoke of this
[57:25] yeah so no wonder he said right I went
[57:28] up and I saw things that are not lawful
[57:30] me to even talk about if he was talking
[57:32] about all Israel to be saved and the
[57:34] world is arguing the religious world is
[57:37] arguing what that Paul was saying when
[57:39] he said all Israel be saved before they
[57:42] come up we Baptist we had that figured
[57:44] out all Israel is not Israel all Jews
[57:46] not Jews all this that Bo we're smart
[57:49] well we did out some much figured
[57:53] out we certainly didn't see what Paul
[57:56] was talking about
[57:59] right but brother Dale I've just always
[58:01] been taught that if I don't seek God God
[58:04] can't seek me where's that at in the
[58:07] Bible I want the quote from the prophet
[58:09] and I want the Bible
[58:12] for you never sought
[58:16] God right look at even a man like the
[58:20] Apostle Paul that God had to run him
[58:22] down and bury his nose in the dirt
[58:26] right to get him to even think about
[58:29] being saved amen because he thought he
[58:32] always
[58:34] was what about the feel of this message
[58:37] yeah come
[58:37] on come I've always was
[58:42] eternal I don't have to be justified
[58:44] Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost I
[58:46] come in the world eternal life and I
[58:48] want the prophets message on that I want
[58:49] the Bible
[58:52] right right
[58:55] if you can't have it then I don't give a
[58:57] hoop what you got right amen cuz it
[59:00] won't fit the
[59:01] word it's time to be
[59:05] plain I always thought it was pretty
[59:08] good
[59:08] anyway but look this is my Covenant unto
[59:14] them not you and
[59:16] I unless we come into it by a new
[59:21] birth but they have a covenant
[59:26] that they won't be
[59:30] annihilated my brother R says in the
[59:33] Bible our word speaking and this
[59:35] generation shall not pass
[59:37] away even Scofield picked that up
[59:41] brother brother said that's a Divine
[59:42] promise that Israel would never be wiped
[59:45] off of the face of the
[59:47] Earth we thought it was some
[59:50] help but even Scofield had that much
[59:53] understanding
[59:57] sure listen for this is my Covenant when
[1:00:01] I shall take away their
[1:00:05] sins sixfold
[1:00:07] purpose as concerning the gospel they
[1:00:11] are enemies for your sake that's
[1:00:15] it oh the natural nation of Israel right
[1:00:19] but as touching the
[1:00:23] election
[1:00:25] come
[1:00:26] on they sealed you come on folk that's
[1:00:29] right as touching the election they are
[1:00:32] beloved for the father's
[1:00:34] sake
[1:00:38] amen read your Bible
[1:00:41] right I CH to just read
[1:00:44] it y make it verse by verse I'd love to
[1:00:48] be able to do that all the time with the
[1:00:49] Bible just I love to do that just take
[1:00:51] it just take one verse right after
[1:00:52] another I said that 40 years ago ain't
[1:00:54] got back to it yet I going to do that
[1:00:57] one day so I'm doing a little of
[1:01:00] it
[1:01:01] listen as concerning the gospel they are
[1:01:06] enemies that's it for your
[1:01:09] sake see what makes them enemies is the
[1:01:11] fact that they never re they don't
[1:01:13] accept Jesus Christ right that's right
[1:01:17] so they're
[1:01:19] enemies but that's touching the
[1:01:22] election now I love the next verse when
[1:01:25] you put it that way
[1:01:28] Y for the gifts and callings of God are
[1:01:31] because I repented because I was so good
[1:01:37] yeah well it's because I cried and
[1:01:39] prayed and S
[1:01:42] him read your
[1:01:45] scripture amen for the calling gifts and
[1:01:48] callings of God are without right
[1:01:52] repentance so you never repented to get
[1:01:55] something right you repented or ought to
[1:01:58] because of feeling knowing how sorry you
[1:02:00] was right
[1:02:03] amen amen
[1:02:06] listen that's your FAL youw that's the
[1:02:10] all Israel that will be
[1:02:14] saved not every
[1:02:17] Israelite not every
[1:02:20] Jew they wouldn't call Jews until you
[1:02:22] come on down into the scripture matter
[1:02:23] of fact that first time the word Jew is
[1:02:25] mentioned is in the Jew or Jews is
[1:02:28] mentioned in the Book of Esther and it's
[1:02:30] mentioned of Mori was a
[1:02:34] Jew but I can't find it to place it in
[1:02:37] the scripture to show exactly what I'm
[1:02:39] talking about but I can find it in
[1:02:40] brother R's message brother R said the
[1:02:43] Jew refers to the tribe of Judah Judah
[1:02:46] amen don't I believe what the scriptures
[1:02:49] I mean what he's saying right listen for
[1:02:52] as ye in times past
[1:02:55] I not believe God
[1:02:58] y yet have now T
[1:03:01] Mercy through your
[1:03:04] unbelief what good thing we do to get
[1:03:07] saved right that's right well I I I
[1:03:10] never did drink and I never did smoke
[1:03:13] and chew or anything I never run around
[1:03:15] with women I never had this or that or
[1:03:17] the other I was never a prostitute talk
[1:03:20] about the girl the sister I I was always
[1:03:23] true and God saved me because of that
[1:03:26] you religious
[1:03:31] hypocrite all is screaming out against
[1:03:35] you what goodness did you
[1:03:39] have what goodness do we have
[1:03:44] now bless God I don't cut my hair I
[1:03:46] don't wear no pants I don't I'm a
[1:03:48] Christian that don't make you a
[1:03:50] Christian that should be the attributes
[1:03:52] of being a Christian
[1:03:55] right you should do that because you're
[1:03:57] a
[1:04:01] Christian whereas in times
[1:04:04] P have not for ye in times P have not
[1:04:07] believed
[1:04:08] God yeah have now obtain Mercy through
[1:04:12] their unbelief right their unbelief you
[1:04:16] received it through their Israel's
[1:04:18] unbelief you and I to come in are you
[1:04:22] reading even so have these
[1:04:25] also
[1:04:27] now not
[1:04:33] believed come on even so have these also
[1:04:38] now not believed
[1:04:41] y that through your mercy
[1:04:47] y they also May obtain
[1:04:53] Mercy
[1:04:57] did you read that y
[1:05:02] amen no
[1:05:04] wonder where's it El not in there back
[1:05:07] of the out of sign comes a
[1:05:16] deliverer when we were over in Israel
[1:05:19] Ruben he said Sam I fought in four
[1:05:22] Wars he said pray for the Peace of
[1:05:25] Israel I said I do every
[1:05:29] day that was really playing for the
[1:05:32] 144,000
[1:05:34] right the true Israel
[1:05:39] right why that they might come
[1:05:42] in and you know what they will one day
[1:05:45] right cuz the Bible says it
[1:05:49] will so read it
[1:05:51] again even so have these like what for
[1:05:54] as in times
[1:05:56] past for ye as in times past have not
[1:06:01] believed God yet have now obtained Mercy
[1:06:05] through their
[1:06:08] unbelief then why wouldn't we want them
[1:06:10] sa why wouldn't we want them to get the
[1:06:12] word why wouldn't we want
[1:06:16] them come on why would we not want them
[1:06:20] saved but you see we're blinded like
[1:06:22] Martin Luther said the Jews ought to be
[1:06:24] got
[1:06:29] killed even
[1:06:33] so have these also now not
[1:06:37] believed that through your mercy
[1:06:41] they also May obtain Mercy
[1:06:45] right for God have concluded them all in
[1:06:50] unbelief that he might have mercy upon
[1:06:53] all yes yes all the depth of the riches
[1:06:56] both of the wisdom amen you remember
[1:06:59] that amen you remember the message
[1:07:03] wisdom not knowledge and understanding
[1:07:05] right wisdom comes first cuz you don't
[1:07:07] know how to use your knowledge right
[1:07:10] right unless you got wisdom which is the
[1:07:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost right oh of
[1:07:14] the dep of the
[1:07:17] riches both of wisdom and knowledge of
[1:07:20] God how unsearchable are his judgments
[1:07:24] in his ways P finding out well now I'll
[1:07:28] tell you what so I just I I don't
[1:07:31] believe that is because you you're
[1:07:33] making salvation without Jesus
[1:07:38] Christ I've done preach the message
[1:07:44] for nobody goes to heaven without Jesus
[1:07:48] Christ am all right Old Testament newest
[1:07:53] Testament foolish virgins they s
[1:07:58] Jew nobody goes to heaven without Jesus
[1:08:01] Christ F in the briide
[1:08:04] right you accuse me of
[1:08:07] that but I always thought we had to be
[1:08:10] born again yes well we used to all think
[1:08:14] that didn't we yes then we begin to read
[1:08:17] the Bible find out a little about F
[1:08:20] about foolish versin right Matthew
[1:08:22] 25
[1:08:25] then we found out hey there is somebody
[1:08:27] maybe that's going to heaven that's not
[1:08:28] born
[1:08:30] again then we found out about
[1:08:34] 144,000
[1:08:36] y now we're finding out about Israel
[1:08:41] amen
[1:08:47] okay all
[1:08:49] right let's prove a couple of
[1:08:52] points go ahead and number
[1:08:57] six this is 222 the the seal paragraph
[1:09:00] 222 oh yes there to be saved here let's
[1:09:04] settle it just a moment let's see what
[1:09:08] yeah
[1:09:09] okay I'll take one let's take Romans
[1:09:12] just a minute and find out if they are
[1:09:14] let's take the book of Romans so now the
[1:09:16] reason I'm giving you this is because
[1:09:17] showing you that he was verifies what
[1:09:20] we're talking about in The Book of
[1:09:21] Romans okay just started he said 11
[1:09:25] chapter 25 26 and listen to what Paul
[1:09:28] and Paul you know said for an angel from
[1:09:30] heaven can preach any other thing let
[1:09:32] him be a curse he said I wouldn't have
[1:09:34] you be ignorant Brethren of the
[1:09:37] mystery therefore blindness is a part
[1:09:40] has come to Isel look at the next
[1:09:48] one this is the sixfold purpose of
[1:09:50] Gabriel's visit to Daniel paragraph 43
[1:09:52] see we read over the
[1:09:54] I admit I did when I read Daniel 70
[1:09:57] weeks I was only dealing with
[1:09:58] 144,000 couldn't figure out how to do
[1:10:01] what to do with the other
[1:10:02] 24,000 CU
[1:10:06] remember that in the in the
[1:10:09] seals you remember Dan and Ephraim was
[1:10:11] taken out back under there was
[1:10:12] originally supposed to have been 13
[1:10:14] tribes y it was in the children of
[1:10:17] Israel and when they sinned Dan and
[1:10:19] ephra did they were taken out and Joseph
[1:10:22] and Levi was place 10 to make the 12
[1:10:24] tribes in the book of of
[1:10:27] Revelations that where you're dealing
[1:10:29] with the
[1:10:33] 144,000 what are you dealing
[1:10:35] with Dan and Ephraim is left out until
[1:10:38] they
[1:10:40] return and when they return what are you
[1:10:42] going to do with the other 24,000 that
[1:10:44] takes their place thank God I know where
[1:10:47] they're at
[1:10:51] now I know where to go
[1:10:54] with I always wondered what are you
[1:10:56] going to do with that 24,000 Brother
[1:10:59] Gary you mean you just going to throw
[1:11:01] them away no
[1:11:03] can't
[1:11:06] no paragraph 43 six more purpose of G
[1:11:10] until God is finished with the
[1:11:12] Gentiles Israel was
[1:11:14] blinded not just speaking 144,000 right
[1:11:19] they went off into sin and
[1:11:21] transgressions against God because God
[1:11:23] blind their eyes that we might be
[1:11:25] drafted in you get it 26th verse now and
[1:11:29] all Israel shall be
[1:11:32] saved he may have not known that FAL
[1:11:35] Jew and what it was dealing with but he
[1:11:39] sure being a prophet he knew how to put
[1:11:41] the word
[1:11:44] together now do you see why brother
[1:11:46] randam was say that's reason I said I'll
[1:11:48] give some of these things to way where
[1:11:50] you can pick it up because
[1:11:55] the prophet said if you don't understand
[1:11:57] Daniel 70
[1:11:59] weeks you won't understand the
[1:12:02] seals so youd miss the fifth one
[1:12:06] Y come on you totally missed the fifth
[1:12:09] seal without the Daniel 70 week right
[1:12:13] amen and you'd Miss Revelations 12 yep
[1:12:17] 13 and all the things he listed guard
[1:12:19] you
[1:12:21] miss look and all Israel shall be saved
[1:12:25] God blinded them perfectly uni they
[1:12:28] cannot see God blinded
[1:12:30] them and all Israel true Israel shall be
[1:12:34] saved what did the angel say to finish
[1:12:37] the transgression of
[1:12:39] Israel I've come to tell you that there
[1:12:42] will come a time when Israel's
[1:12:43] transgression will be finished that's
[1:12:46] not just 144,000 right that's that F
[1:12:49] still Jew God will cut off that wild
[1:12:52] branch and graft into that back that
[1:12:56] real Branch
[1:12:58] again oh sometimes it makes my heart
[1:13:00] junk to see them
[1:13:03] poor isra people cut off that under not
[1:13:08] knowing where they're going and think
[1:13:10] that God in his Mercy did that so I
[1:13:14] could be
[1:13:17] saved blinded their eyes from their own
[1:13:20] Messiah shut their ears up that they
[1:13:23] could not hear him it look right at his
[1:13:27] miracles and look right at his miracles
[1:13:30] and things that he was doing they look
[1:13:34] right at him and couldn't see
[1:13:39] right go to the
[1:13:44] next
[1:13:47] 46 Matthew I believe the 12th chapter or
[1:13:50] the 8th or the 12th chapter matter of
[1:13:52] fact that's Matthew 13:15
[1:13:55] right you know if you want to write it
[1:13:57] down he's a human being you know right
[1:14:01] he could give up on his
[1:14:04] scriptures because in Matthew 15 13:15
[1:14:08] is where this scripture the Matthew I
[1:14:10] believe the 12th chapter or the 8th or
[1:14:12] the 12th chapter said though Jesus said
[1:14:15] had Jesus had done so many miracles yet
[1:14:18] they could not believe because God said
[1:14:20] they got eyes and they can't see and
[1:14:22] ears and they can't hear unless they
[1:14:24] would see with their eyes and hear with
[1:14:26] their ears and I would convert
[1:14:33] them see I used to just think that's
[1:14:36] because they blinded theirselves no it's
[1:14:38] because he blinded
[1:14:40] them the ones that blinded themselves is
[1:14:42] not the ones I'm dependent upon of the
[1:14:45] roots that's carrying me come on Don
[1:14:48] said they said sometimes you get
[1:14:50] sometimes I do get
[1:14:52] upset at the stupidity and carnality of
[1:14:55] us that's right bunch of preachers and
[1:14:57] car the
[1:14:58] things twisting this message that's
[1:15:01] right
[1:15:02] amen but so that we could have a change
[1:15:06] he pulled a curtain down on his own
[1:15:08] children's eyes right turn his own
[1:15:10] children away from the table and turn
[1:15:12] them off to leanness of spirit that he
[1:15:15] might find that we might have a chance
[1:15:17] to life give us life 26th verse now he's
[1:15:22] back in Romans
[1:15:24] so all Israel shall be saved it is
[1:15:26] written there shall come out of Zion to
[1:15:27] deliver the out of Zion because this is
[1:15:29] where it's coming the message is going
[1:15:31] to go and shall turn away ungodliness
[1:15:33] from Jacob run that scripture back in
[1:15:35] your reference and you'll see that it
[1:15:37] says two
[1:15:40] Zion yeah because it was back there
[1:15:42] coming to Zion now it's out of Zion
[1:15:45] going to Israel see yes he will come to
[1:15:48] Mount Zion one of these days watch upon
[1:15:52] the Mount of Olives they recognize him
[1:15:54] and all Israel will know it's him now
[1:15:57] there's your 144,000 MH the Gentiles
[1:16:00] will be finished then that Branch that's
[1:16:03] been grafted in God will take them take
[1:16:06] from it the fruit that's been gathered
[1:16:09] and that wild Branch will be
[1:16:16] yep go to the next
[1:16:20] one still in the six full purpose PR he
[1:16:23] is now remember and on back in here as
[1:16:26] you read he said if that Roots was holy
[1:16:29] and that Roots was a holy root also the
[1:16:32] fruit that comes up from that Holy root
[1:16:33] will bring holy fruit and if that root
[1:16:36] was Jesus Christ who is both root and
[1:16:39] offspring of David if that life was in
[1:16:41] him come up through the Jewish
[1:16:43] generation and was cut off from
[1:16:45] them come up through the Jewish root
[1:16:47] remember Christ in the Old Testament
[1:16:49] right
[1:16:51] right and cut off from them and their
[1:16:55] eyes blinded that we might see our lives
[1:16:58] will have to pattern with a blessed
[1:17:00] Branch oh yes brother that's right why
[1:17:04] can't we weep for
[1:17:05] them right why can't we weep go ahead to
[1:17:09] the next
[1:17:11] one paragraph 49 still in God cut them
[1:17:14] all purposely and blinded their eyes so
[1:17:17] that we can have a chance to see giving
[1:17:19] us an opportunity and we will rock
[1:17:21] around like mhm we're
[1:17:24] somebody Paul tells them here take heed
[1:17:28] of how you do that take heed for if God
[1:17:30] sped not the natural Branch how will he
[1:17:33] have an have any more Mercy on the wild
[1:17:36] Branch that's already so we walk around
[1:17:38] and say I'm Presbyterian I'm Methodist
[1:17:40] I'm Baptist I'm Pentecostal that don't
[1:17:43] mean nothing to God we got to be born
[1:17:45] again of that Holy Spirit that come from
[1:17:47] the root he come and remember he's not
[1:17:50] speaking of the
[1:17:52] Gentiles
[1:17:53] I'm just throwing this in here so that
[1:17:55] you can see where the Gentiles had their
[1:17:57] change but he come to finish the
[1:17:59] transgression make a finish of it that's
[1:18:03] right in the
[1:18:05] transgression
[1:18:07] right if I go any further I got a bunch
[1:18:09] of scriptures to
[1:18:11] read so we'll pick up right there this
[1:18:14] afternoon continue to the
[1:18:16] thought I hope you see what I'm talking
[1:18:18] about amen amen amen amen amen yes sir
[1:18:24] Daniel 70 weeks is dealing with amen
[1:18:27] Israel as a nation yes right now to show
[1:18:31] you some
[1:18:33] keys somebody is going to preedee us
[1:18:37] here and build a millennium Temple
[1:18:45] right and I don't think that it's going
[1:18:49] to be some goofball American
[1:18:56] I think it'll be Israel amen that's
[1:19:00] right yep amen I always thought I'll
[1:19:03] pick this up this afternoon and car the
[1:19:05] thought
[1:19:06] on I've always
[1:19:08] believed having to change some thoughts
[1:19:10] that I'm having yes but I've always
[1:19:13] believed the Millennium is to Israel yep
[1:19:16] because it's a promise to David that his
[1:19:19] son would sit on his
[1:19:21] throne Solomon in the natural but one
[1:19:26] day Jesus Christ will set on that throne
[1:19:29] in the
[1:19:30] Millennium and it ain't going to all be
[1:19:32] Gentiles that's surrounding it
[1:19:35] no
[1:19:38] right we know for a certainty the
[1:19:40] 144,000 would be in the Millennium the
[1:19:42] prophet said M right is he going to
[1:19:45] leave out to 24,000 to keep them from
[1:19:47] being in the Millennium I don't think
[1:19:51] so but where is all that Israel come
[1:20:01] for no is Israel is a nation right in
[1:20:05] the
[1:20:06] Millennium
[1:20:10] yep that's Le
[1:20:15] thing have we left
[1:20:18] Israel out of the Plan of
[1:20:21] Redemption
[1:20:25] right is there a way that she could be
[1:20:28] redeemed I'm talking about Israel as a
[1:20:30] nation I'm not talking about Old
[1:20:32] Testament Jews I covered that now I'm
[1:20:35] talking about the Israel as a nation
[1:20:37] from Calvary until the end the fifth
[1:20:39] seal
[1:20:40] Jew we going to do with her yes Lord
[1:20:49] amen and brother brandham
[1:20:51] says
[1:20:54] that when he
[1:20:56] comes in the
[1:20:59] Millennium to the
[1:21:04] 144,000 then they'll see him in a
[1:21:07] body they don't see him in a
[1:21:10] body until that time that's right they
[1:21:13] see him through two witnesses that's
[1:21:15] right right he's coming in the
[1:21:18] Millennium let me make another
[1:21:21] statement
[1:21:24] the Millennium is in
[1:21:29] him the Millennium is in Jesus Christ
[1:21:32] right
[1:21:34] right there won't be no Millennium
[1:21:36] without Jesus Christ right amen and all
[1:21:40] salvation is tied to Jesus Christ let's
[1:21:46] stand think on these
[1:21:50] things the more is unold holding
[1:21:54] right more is opening to us that we may
[1:21:58] see the Plan of Redemption
[1:22:03] amen where the Prophet said you would
[1:22:06] miss it in the Daniel 70 week said you'd
[1:22:07] miss it if you don't get this correct
[1:22:12] amen so You' Totally Miss the fal Jew if
[1:22:15] you didn't have Daniel 70 weeks
[1:22:17] cor cuz they got to have a place
[1:22:19] somewhere that their transgression comes

[1:22:38] those sixf purposes is in the
