[9:43] each and every one of us and keep us in
[9:45] Jesus name
[9:46] amen
[9:48] Revelations one one through three
[9:52] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[9:55] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[9:57] things which most shortly come to pass
[9:59] and he said and signified it by his
[10:02] Angel and to his servant John
[10:05] through my record of the word of God and
[10:07] of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of
[10:09] all things that he saw
[10:10] blessed it is he that readeth and they
[10:13] that hear the words of this prophecy who
[10:15] keep those things which are written
[10:17] therein
[10:18] or what the time is at hand Revelations
[10:23] 13 we'll begin reading with verse 11.
[10:27] and I'll be held another Beast coming
[10:29] out of the earth and he had two horns
[10:31] like a lamb
[10:33] and his fake as a dragon
[10:35] and he exercised all the power of the
[10:37] first Beast before him and causes the
[10:39] Earth and them which dwell therein to
[10:42] worship the first Beast whose deadly
[10:45] wound was healed can you do a great
[10:47] Wonder so that he make a fire come down
[10:49] from heaven on the earth in the side of
[10:52] men
[10:53] and he deceiveth them that dwell on the
[10:55] Earth by the means of those Miracles
[10:58] which he had power to do in the sight of
[11:01] the Beast
[11:02] saying to them that that dwell on the
[11:05] earth that they should make an image to
[11:08] the Beast
[11:09] which had the wound By The Sword and
[11:12] didn't live now watch the next verse
[11:14] and if you're running if you're running
[11:16] a reference on the image of the Beast if
[11:19] you run in your reference three ways
[11:21] there you'll get a whole lot more quotes
[11:22] and brother random will say image to the
[11:26] Beast he'll say image of the Beast he'll
[11:29] say image unto the Beast
[11:31] so you know it'll all tie together so
[11:34] watch now here it says the image to the
[11:36] Beast which we had to wound By The Sword
[11:38] and did allele and he had power to give
[11:40] life into the image of the Beast that
[11:43] the image of the Beast should both speak
[11:45] and cause as many as would not worship
[11:48] the image of the Beast should be like
[11:52] killed you may be seated the Lord had
[11:54] his Blessing we won't wound down into
[11:55] the other person we're trying to to stay
[11:59] in a line to you know to just be able to
[12:04] follow our thought
[12:07] we're going to be talking today on the
[12:09] image to the Beast and like I said run
[12:12] it in then you'll see image of the Beast
[12:14] you'll see image
[12:16] unto the Beast and that way you'll
[12:19] you'll get a whole lot more quotes if
[12:21] you'll do it another way from the
[12:23] prophet all right now what have we been
[12:25] doing
[12:27] we've been taking these things to see
[12:30] what these will be and we know these
[12:32] things that we have covered and want to
[12:35] keep covering from not
[12:37] um you know
[12:38] you go over to the seventh chapter 8
[12:41] chapter 9 10 11 12 and up to the 13th
[12:45] and you're seeing that that's covering
[12:47] only a three and a half year period of
[12:49] time upon the earth called the
[12:52] tribulation of Israel and you see all of
[12:55] these things and they say as we're
[12:57] beginning to see them my point is to get
[13:00] us to work that we can understand what's
[13:03] going on and I mentioned the other day
[13:05] you know that we uh we were reviewing a
[13:08] lot of these things and the sister said
[13:10] you're not reviewing it to me so that's
[13:11] the first time I've heard it right so
[13:13] that's maybe that's good to work that we
[13:16] can do it you know what meaning is you
[13:19] know this going through these things one
[13:21] right after the other and I pray that
[13:24] the Lord will bless us and and give us
[13:26] understanding ears to hear
[13:30] because
[13:31] even though we're not in the tribulation
[13:33] if we've covered the because the Rapture
[13:37] goes up into chapter four therefore one
[13:39] and then the bride the prophet says not
[13:42] seen until chapter 19 coming back riding
[13:46] into the Millennium all right then these
[13:48] things are to Israel and what's
[13:50] transpiring but we can look at the
[13:53] things that are here and see where they
[13:56] started at right
[13:58] like the seals and things see go all the
[14:01] way back to Genesis and start and come
[14:04] down
[14:05] to where we're at and then get down here
[14:07] and then we can understand what will
[14:09] transpire right and why it will be those
[14:13] things and why the Antichrist will come
[14:16] into being and and why the man of sin
[14:18] will sit in the temple of God and
[14:20] showing himself to be as God because we
[14:22] can see how it starts back here and
[14:24] unfolds down through but the main thing
[14:27] is to see that these things is to Israel
[14:30] but remember we see our day in this hour
[14:35] upon the Earth to to walk there in and
[14:38] then we we're trying to do I'll try to
[14:41] if I can remember it if I don't get down
[14:43] far enough run around actually covers
[14:46] on the image of the Beast about he said
[14:49] Luther started out with the truth
[14:52] sure he said but then they denominated
[14:54] right and he said they started forming
[14:57] the image to the Beast he said Wesley
[15:00] done wonderful starting out with the
[15:02] truth he said but then Dayton begin to
[15:05] denominate well see Luther even though
[15:07] brother Brown will use Luther news
[15:08] Wesley but remember Luther never
[15:10] denominated in church right let's be
[15:12] never denominated in the church right
[15:14] but the people after them you know went
[15:17] on to denominate and and cause into
[15:20] things and there's where your image to
[15:22] the Beast you'll see that it will begin
[15:24] to unfold and you can see it's right
[15:27] Among Us right right here now because
[15:29] you know that's what's taking place all
[15:32] right but now what I want to do is to
[15:34] just drop back and and we'll just start
[15:37] and see kind of in the 13th chapter
[15:40] because this this chapter has more to do
[15:43] with us
[15:44] then say basically the others because
[15:46] it's showing uh America and where it's
[15:50] at right
[15:51] and showing how we come into being
[15:53] you know and what is the reason for us
[15:56] and what we're doing and that's what I
[15:58] want you to see is the the thing right
[16:00] now Among Us right here right
[16:03] see we can look as as we did before and
[16:06] say well we don't know what these
[16:08] symbols are we don't know what this
[16:10] means we don't know what that means but
[16:13] when a prophet comes along and talks
[16:15] about is we'll read in a minute like the
[16:17] two horns you know the Lamb with two
[16:20] horns he said that was the American
[16:22] Buffalo right well he's putting it right
[16:24] down to where we live right
[16:26] you know and then on your your your
[16:29] Indian Head pennies and things you know
[16:31] woman to the nation because America is
[16:34] in the 13th chapter of the Book of
[16:36] Revelation you know as it's coming forth
[16:40] and manifestation but remember you you
[16:43] when you look at something even though
[16:45] this takes place right here
[16:48] the scripture is telling you where it's
[16:50] at right but yet there's got to be a
[16:52] lead up to it right
[16:54] So It Begins back there see it didn't
[16:56] begin as a beast it was covering the
[16:59] seals in the Thunder it began as a
[17:02] Antichrist and really it didn't begin as
[17:04] the Antichrist Innovation is what we
[17:06] look at it it began just as a Saiyan
[17:09] a little Doctrine right a little idea
[17:13] that's right yeah
[17:15] what don't you think like I try to get
[17:17] you to look it up you know what that and
[17:19] I see him counselor 325 A.D you know
[17:22] well they just come in there saying that
[17:25] Jesus was not the same substance of God
[17:29] we'll see you could argue and say well
[17:30] the bodies this and God is this and that
[17:34] enrolled just that little thing began to
[17:37] bring in enough until you would
[17:38] eventually wind up with a community
[17:41] Doctrine right coming forth amen all
[17:45] right see then it's all leading up and
[17:47] that's what I'm wanting us to look at it
[17:48] but let's go back into what we've we've
[17:51] covered a little and we're going to use
[17:53] it
[17:54] and just read it and make sure that we
[17:57] follow this throughout the early chapter
[17:59] of the Book of Revelations go ahead
[18:01] brothers and pull up the
[18:02] the uh things and we'll just read it
[18:06] but I want you to think about it we'll
[18:07] read it we'll stop in a verse read
[18:09] something verse maybe a little on this
[18:11] because you know if I ever get time I
[18:14] told my wife the other day I said I want
[18:16] to get in the Book of Romans and take
[18:17] Romans 1. and explain it in verse 2 and
[18:21] verse 3. I want to do that I used to do
[18:23] that a lot you know and I'd like to get
[18:26] back into there but I'm just tied up too
[18:29] much maybe in the Millennium we'll get
[18:31] back there
[18:32] but now notice
[18:37] see it says in verse 1
[18:39] and I stood upon the sand of the sea
[18:42] standing up here see and saw a beast
[18:45] rise up out of the sea and then seven
[18:47] horns seven heads ten horns and upon his
[18:49] horns ten crowns and upon the heads of
[18:52] the name of blasphema all right
[18:54] now
[18:57] this one right this beach Rises up out
[19:00] of the sea
[19:05] now
[19:06] well we read in 11th verse we'll see the
[19:09] one coming up out of the earth that is
[19:10] more of the United States right
[19:12] right this is Rome coming forth into the
[19:15] seven heads and and the horns and the
[19:18] things the crowns is the Roman Catholic
[19:20] Church that rules the world spiritually
[19:24] in the extent of what they're doing and
[19:27] you know that they just recently if
[19:29] you'll run it in on Google you'll find
[19:31] it's been in there probably a while but
[19:33] Brother Richard brought my attention if
[19:35] you'll run in on Google you'll find it
[19:37] and just type in uh sing for the Pope
[19:41] you know where he's wanting a seat to be
[19:44] set aside for him
[19:46] in the upper room
[19:50] in the upper room he wants it set aside
[19:52] a seat for him
[19:54] in the upper room
[19:56] and his point of saying is that
[19:59] people can come to see these things
[20:04] it's this gradually little things coming
[20:07] in you know there's a lot of Catholic
[20:10] shrines in in Israel
[20:13] there's a lot of places you go down like
[20:16] where where the angel appeared to marry
[20:18] Bethlehem remember that one
[20:20] and and you're going to go into a
[20:22] Catholic Church
[20:24] that's built there with the place of
[20:27] where the water is running there's a lot
[20:29] of Catholic things are but now see with
[20:33] the the Jewish people I was thinking
[20:35] yesterday about they don't care
[20:38] about all of them shrines being put up
[20:40] as long as they're getting the money
[20:43] that's right they're only concerned with
[20:45] the money coming in they don't care how
[20:48] much right because they're not
[20:49] Christians that's right
[20:51] they wasn't here and they don't care to
[20:54] make all of these covenants with
[20:58] you know with Rome
[21:00] why because
[21:02] they're not Christians as we call it you
[21:05] know they don't accept Jesus Christ
[21:08] see they're still under their old doings
[21:10] and they'll go back to their sacrifices
[21:12] one day but it's getting ready see they
[21:14] have to go through the government to get
[21:16] it okay that's right
[21:18] so he wants him a seat sitting right up
[21:20] there in the
[21:22] Upper Room
[21:24] all right
[21:26] I say give him a seat let him put all he
[21:28] wants to do on there yeah
[21:30] because that's just going to bring that
[21:32] much more amen right and bring us into
[21:34] being but you see what we're talking
[21:36] about now what is it the seven heads the
[21:38] only place in the world sets on seven he
[21:40] opened his Rome Italy Cincinnati Ohio
[21:42] does but it's not a religious center
[21:44] it's ruling the world this is the Beast
[21:47] that rises up out of the sea out of the
[21:52] people the multitudes is out there
[21:54] what's your prophet in a minute when he
[21:56] defines America right
[21:58] right you know and you're so specific of
[21:59] the wording that he uses but look and
[22:02] the Beast which I saw was like under a
[22:04] leopard and see where is the feet of a
[22:05] bar and like a lion and a dragon we know
[22:09] that dragon is wrong right so we went
[22:11] through coming down through the the
[22:13] Nebuchadnezzar and then down through the
[22:16] the Greeks and the the Alexander and
[22:19] coming on down to the Natural government
[22:21] of Rome
[22:23] you know the Romans were ruling the
[22:25] Known World basically of the time of
[22:27] Christ right all right then in doing
[22:30] that then we see things happen because
[22:34] we got into verse 3 in one of it heads
[22:36] where it wounded at the death and the
[22:38] deadly wound was healed and the world
[22:40] wandered after the Beast we found what
[22:42] that was when
[22:43] natural Rome could no longer rule
[22:46] it was a nation it could no longer Rule
[22:50] and be deceiving right
[22:52] but what happened was in natural Rome
[22:55] Pagan Rome as we call it the natural
[22:58] Roman world see was annihilated all
[23:02] right but you see it coming right back
[23:05] up in
[23:06] right because they had many gods they
[23:08] had many kinds of things and then you
[23:10] see them right over and you see
[23:11] Constantine helping the church and and
[23:15] all of the things that was taking place
[23:17] and just bringing it in and what then
[23:20] Hagan wrong become what Apple wrong
[23:27] and brother random you want this quote
[23:29] run around and said they say we're the
[23:31] first church he said that's exactly
[23:33] right that's right
[23:35] man he said the early church
[23:41] the bride the church
[23:44] what the nazia Rome
[23:47] and a lot left and went back home
[23:50] but what did they bring a Doctrine
[23:54] sure they didn't go over there and
[23:56] showing up with it and all they seen
[23:58] what it was and they left right but what
[23:59] did they bring little ideas you called
[24:01] little sayings
[24:04] and when it did Apple Rome come into bed
[24:09] because remember now this Beast is going
[24:11] to have to rule the world
[24:13] and Rome in the government
[24:16] they lost that ability right
[24:19] I mean
[24:21] but yet now the Catholic church has the
[24:23] ability to control the world
[24:25] called who can make war against him
[24:28] like I was showing you there the other
[24:30] day we're over there in you know the
[24:33] country where the pope came from back in
[24:36] where was it Poland and they just
[24:39] stopped the whole thing by walking out
[24:41] there in this military wouldn't fire on
[24:44] them
[24:45] food
[24:47] they look at it all around the world
[24:48] tonight
[24:51] but watch them and they worship the
[24:53] Dragon
[24:56] that's not some kind of a dragon with a
[24:59] thing and you're bowing down and no it's
[25:01] when you're beginning we'll get more
[25:03] into the market of these than a hundred
[25:04] base okay it's when the the Roman ideas
[25:09] like I said a moment ago they had many
[25:12] gods well then they couldn't accept one
[25:14] God
[25:15] no under their religious ideas because
[25:19] they were still so much natural wrong
[25:21] that spirit that that pain was
[25:24] controlling
[25:26] and then they started putting up mini
[25:28] knives and naked Peter one making this
[25:32] one one making that one my friend said
[25:35] they took down the images of their other
[25:37] things and put up people you know like
[25:40] Mary and starting to do it right and
[25:44] what it did what's began to happen
[25:46] they worshiped the dragon which gave
[25:48] power unto the Beast and they worshiped
[25:50] the Beast said who is likened to the
[25:52] Beast who is able to make war with him
[25:54] yeah
[25:56] all right now spiritually speaking
[25:59] who's able to make war yep with him
[26:04] because you see
[26:06] your ability to speak now is vastly
[26:09] going away
[26:11] yeah that's right you know amen you
[26:14] think that it's not even meaning for
[26:16] that but for you to even use uh
[26:19] you know the words gay and stuff like
[26:22] that you can be tried for hate crime
[26:25] now who do you think is behind all that
[26:27] right
[26:33] right who do you think is controlling
[26:34] when Reagan and the pope got together
[26:36] and done away with Communism wasn't that
[26:38] something yeah
[26:39] let's just wipe out a nation
[26:42] because they
[26:46] done it with her own dogs
[26:49] that is going through it
[26:53] but think
[26:55] who is able to make war with him now
[26:57] we'll get on down in a minute on this
[26:59] with the image of the Beast
[27:02] because anybody right now could drop a
[27:05] bomb on the vatically you know we know
[27:08] they won't
[27:09] they won't but I mean it could because
[27:10] the government you know it's a thing
[27:12] and Rome Italy is actually a government
[27:15] it is a government within the government
[27:19] all right you agree
[27:23] I'd consider about Washington D.C
[27:26] if I was you
[27:30] Washington DC is a government within the
[27:34] government it is not a state
[27:38] it is a government within the government
[27:41] kind of that's why we're getting to the
[27:44] image of the beast but who's able to
[27:46] make war see here's where now we're
[27:48] going to come into being
[27:50] because who could make war now
[27:53] when they declare a problem in a country
[27:56] who's the first groups to go
[27:59] it's supposed to be the United Nations
[28:03] right it was set up for the United
[28:06] Nations and he's going to put so many
[28:09] troops from each country into a police
[28:12] force
[28:13] and when you did then if anybody went
[28:16] wrong you just sent that Force well it
[28:18] was their own people to be sent right
[28:20] back on them right it was a good idea
[28:22] but veteran said it won't work right all
[28:25] right but see who's the first one to go
[28:28] to all these places
[28:29] the United States because who's able to
[28:33] make war
[28:36] against the United States
[28:38] we have the Firepower we have the
[28:41] ability
[28:43] watch it a minute what your Prophet says
[28:45] those a lot of those things are
[28:48] we're the only nation in the world that
[28:49] has the ability to control the world he
[28:52] said well we're not able to do this we
[28:54] could do anything right
[28:59] in Vietnam
[29:01] my brother-in-law knew a high-ranking
[29:03] official
[29:06] and he said we don't need nuclear Wars
[29:09] to stop that
[29:12] he said we've got the ability
[29:15] to take them out
[29:19] this was a high-ranking man he said we
[29:21] had them ever want to almost captured
[29:23] and said we had orders to back out and
[29:26] said we sat there and let them walk out
[29:27] to be a communist thing yeah
[29:31] the you can't have the control right
[29:34] look over there what's China to us
[29:38] he's always afraid of this my friend now
[29:41] we're afraid of the rest of the world
[29:42] joining up with them
[29:44] because they don't have the ability not
[29:47] supposed to be to be able to bring a
[29:49] bomb over here if it did it'd be limited
[29:51] well all we've got to do is fly up
[29:53] no more
[29:56] China
[29:58] no more Russia
[30:01] but they won't let us do it
[30:03] right right
[30:07] they won't let us do it even so much
[30:09] control is on even a little country of
[30:13] Israel until they won't let them defend
[30:15] themselves
[30:17] the yet they can drop bombs on them
[30:20] every day you know rockets and missiles
[30:22] are flying in there every day
[30:25] but they're not allowed to even tell a
[30:27] lot of times those things are happening
[30:28] right
[30:30] somebody's controlling this thing and it
[30:34] certainly is not a governmental United
[30:36] States
[30:40] see
[30:41] it's something else it's recording you
[30:44] know coming in and taking over and
[30:47] I remember back years ago a lot of you
[30:49] in early ones in the message back in the
[30:51] 60s and 70s everybody was against the
[30:54] Illuminati you remember that
[30:58] for super rich
[31:00] the illuminatis boy everybody
[31:03] and there was people in the message that
[31:05] quit paying income taxes and all kind of
[31:07] things you know to try to protest stuff
[31:10] like that
[31:14] ain't nothing but a flash up in the
[31:16] front of you
[31:18] like run around and said don't worry
[31:19] about communism
[31:22] he says there's no scripture that it'll
[31:25] ever rule the world right he said but
[31:27] worry about Catholicism so don't worry
[31:30] about all the iron curtains and the
[31:32] thing he said you better be concerned
[31:34] with the purple one yeah that's right
[31:36] amen wrong right and they're gradually
[31:41] taking over yes but they're not and you
[31:44] know as far as I know even till now that
[31:46] the Catholic church is not the last I
[31:48] heard years ago they're not even a
[31:50] member of the World Council of churches
[31:54] but they have delegates there
[31:59] that was 20 30 years ago or more than
[32:01] that
[32:02] they have delegates there what are they
[32:04] doing the Bible says he's going to come
[32:07] in according to the Book of Daniel Comes
[32:08] In by flattery
[32:10] he's invited in and you know to come in
[32:14] and running
[32:16] like Wade was talking about in the Dave
[32:19] Ramsey thing or what he was just saying
[32:21] oh you know if you wanted somebody to
[32:23] run your bank that you've had would you
[32:25] go out on the street and get a bomb that
[32:27] ain't never you know he he
[32:32] been bankrupt what all his life and
[32:34] don't no you don't get damn you get a
[32:36] man's in charge well who's got the
[32:38] wealth to the world today
[32:42] the prophet years ago when gold was 35
[32:44] an ounce was talking about the Catholic
[32:46] Church having billions and billions of
[32:49] dollars of gold
[32:50] when would be the best guy to run the
[32:52] world right now amen
[32:56] surprising to me I would have probably
[32:58] voted to what was his name the one that
[33:00] run against Obama because he was a big
[33:03] man
[33:05] he had made great billions he was a
[33:09] smart guy
[33:10] if you want somebody to run the country
[33:12] get a smart guy and get a rich guy he's
[33:15] got a lot of Investments his Investments
[33:18] is going down see
[33:20] what you see what I'm talking about
[33:21] right the control comes in gradually
[33:27] until it just squeezing out right why
[33:31] because we're forming the image to the
[33:33] Beast right
[33:34] we've got the power to rule the world
[33:36] the Catholic Church doesn't have a a a
[33:39] military power
[33:43] so you got to have the image of the
[33:44] Beast to raise up to be the military
[33:46] power
[33:49] and see then we're going to do what they
[33:51] say
[33:53] is that true
[33:55] who is able to make war
[33:58] with him we'll get back more than the
[34:00] image of the Beast and looking worse
[34:03] five
[34:05] that was given unto him a mouth-speaking
[34:08] great things and blasphemies
[34:11] the power was given unto him to continue
[34:13] for him too much that's in the
[34:15] tribulation right 1260 days right she
[34:17] wasn't worth that
[34:19] and he opened his mouth in blasphemy
[34:22] against God to blasting his name and his
[34:25] Tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven
[34:29] now before I've never heard the pope
[34:32] Blanche theme he's always been sweet
[34:39] but when he says he's instead of God
[34:42] come on folks amen when he says he said
[34:46] instead of God that's blaspheming God
[34:50] run
[34:53] and I say if you notice in this if you
[34:55] look there's a lot of times black
[34:56] stainless blacks theme is in 13th
[34:58] chapter
[34:58] right and he's talking about
[35:01] an image to the Beast and he's talking
[35:04] about image of the Beast and he's
[35:05] talking about blasphemen then you get
[35:07] over in about the 17th chapter somewhere
[35:09] along in there and you'll find out that
[35:11] it's the names of glass things and run
[35:13] around there you remember in the message
[35:15] blessing his name said
[35:17] that's what he called him he said
[35:18] instead of saying names of last names he
[35:21] said call the Blasphemous names
[35:24] because that's what it is he's in
[35:26] Methodist Madness Presbyterian Pentecost
[35:28] who may I add brown eyes anybody gonna
[35:31] get mad at me for saying that everyone I
[35:34] mean
[35:36] you better believe I I'm
[35:39] if you you just wait on down the road if
[35:42] this thing goes on a little while
[35:43] they're going to be trying to get us
[35:45] together because we're beginning to get
[35:46] to be a big group of people in the world
[35:50] right there's Millions following this
[35:52] message now
[35:54] don't you think that they're going to
[35:56] try to get us in the world Council
[35:57] churches

[36:54] at God have you

[38:24] woman's seed that the remnant of the
[38:27] woman said to the river of Israel is 144
[38:30] 000. that's what your Prophet said the

[39:09] written in the Book of Life in the last
[39:11] name before the foundation World I'll
[39:12] take that back out into YouTube on
[39:14] another message later all right but this
[39:17] is where I live
[39:18] If any man have an ear
[39:21] let him hear
[39:25] when we get down to the to the Beast and
[39:27] the doings of his number and it said to
[39:30] him that have to understand
[39:35] wisdom understanding
[39:39] he that lead us into captivity shall go
[39:42] into captivity

[39:46] killed his assortments from being killed
[39:48] with the sword uh you know here you deal
[39:50] with that a lot
[39:51] but what about he that leadeth into
[39:53] captivity she'll go into captivity
[39:57] you realize I Pastor a church

[40:02] somewhere in close to 100 Souls that's
[40:05] right I'm not responsible for you out
[40:07] there on the internet system that are
[40:08] listening because I'm not your pastor
[40:11] but even my voice is going out there
[40:15] you know what if I teach a false
[40:17] Doctrine I'm going into captivity right

[40:36] I'm glad you're reading listening to
[40:39] tapes I want you to do those things
[40:44] and if I'm off somewhere come and tell
[40:47] me all right all right could I've got it
[40:50] made see
[40:51] I've always told you this
[40:53] if I'm wrong and you show me it's off
[40:57] your shoulders number one that's right
[40:59] but number one is I can accept truth and
[41:02] get straightened up right
[41:04] but if I'm right
[41:08] now I'm still okay
[41:10] and still not a dogmatic hateful old guy
[41:13] that tries to push everything over on
[41:14] everybody to make them believe it I
[41:16] preach something and I go on down the
[41:18] road
[41:20] because I've never been one to just keep
[41:21] arguing with people about it
[41:23] right words that ever solved anything
[41:25] yeah it's a it's a jump in a quote it's
[41:30] a grabbing the scriptures and like the
[41:32] Church of Christ man said I I got a
[41:34] scripture shoot down your scripture you
[41:37] know like it's all messed up which one
[41:39] do you want you know
[41:41] we'll see I'm sorry I'm just no never
[41:43] was made that away when the brother got
[41:46] up that time and he said go to the
[41:47] Daniel 70 weeks he said well there's
[41:48] seven no over here they're talking about
[41:50] seven over here they're talking about
[41:51] three and a half he said we'll just make
[41:52] it feel nice
[41:54] now that wasn't no answer to nobody that
[41:57] was mass confusion amen
[42:01] see church I'm trying to get you and I
[42:03] to to realize the truth
[42:07] but mainly in this part of the series
[42:09] since we got up into these things is to
[42:11] get you and I to see where we're at
[42:18] you think it can't be done but your
[42:20] money can be gone before you get home
[42:27] yes but brother Dave I don't believe
[42:29] that's under persecution
[42:30] yeah
[42:32] well I will remind you
[42:37] that in about 20 something they had
[42:42] a crash of the economy here in America
[42:45] called the Great Depression right
[42:49] right that's right you don't think that
[42:53] we're so great until we can't be
[42:55] right
[42:58] a Great Depression struck and overnight
[43:01] people were jumping out of Windows
[43:02] giving themselves but you didn't have
[43:04] anything to do yeah they set up rules
[43:07] mad brother Dale laws is in in places
[43:09] that can't go so far
[43:17] all you can do is close the bank
[43:21] will you close the bank and I can't get
[43:23] my money
[43:26] where am I at all right
[43:30] around said if you knew what you had in
[43:32] your pocket you'd take it out and burn
[43:33] it
[43:38] he said keep your homes and take the
[43:40] mark of the beast
[43:43] me
[43:47] I don't believe in the bride going
[43:49] through the tribulation no way in the
[43:50] world right
[43:52] but it can get pretty drastic right
[43:55] right that's right
[43:57] why because it's going to take something
[43:59] to bring even out of the right place
[44:02] but listen George were you are you
[44:04] following me what I'm trying to say
[44:05] looking in our day and where we're at
[44:08] the great land of America and thank God
[44:11] for it and like I said the other night
[44:13] there was nowhere in the world any other
[44:15] country would have the the materialistic
[44:17] ability to put this message and walk to
[44:20] the fork to the world
[44:22] in America
[44:24] I Don't Preach all doomsday how bad we
[44:27] are how bad this is done
[44:29] I'm glad that God chose
[44:32] an American
[44:33] that spoke our language
[44:36] to bring the message to us because if
[44:40] not you'd be at the mercy of somebody
[44:42] translating it
[44:43] to you which could mean one Higher left
[44:47] off that's right and we got it bad
[44:49] enough because we're human right
[44:53] you know speaking what are you following
[44:56] me
[44:58] I'm not looking for horrible things I'm
[45:02] just going every day being what I am
[45:04] if it comes we deal with it right that's
[45:07] right you can't figure it out that's
[45:10] right no because once you get it figured
[45:12] out it's not going to happen that way
[45:14] right
[45:15] that's it
[45:17] that's what everybody says well the
[45:19] coming of the Lord is going to be on a
[45:20] certain day when if you can say that
[45:21] then
[45:22] you're out of the Bible before you start
[45:23] because the Bible says you can't know
[45:25] today
[45:26] some of your Liars start with
[45:29] people don't like that see they like
[45:32] they grow the house somebody that's made
[45:34] all these predictions and all these
[45:36] things
[45:37] they'd rather listen to somebody like
[45:39] that than to listen to somebody that
[45:41] stood in 1974 and said this thing can go
[45:43] to 2026 and not break the profits
[45:46] message nor in the Bible and many people
[45:48] have ever wanted to hear that
[45:51] all right
[45:52] nobody
[45:56] they don't even ask me well how did you
[45:59] come up with that
[46:05] what you see Church
[46:07] they don't want you they want somebody
[46:09] that's we see why she you know why
[46:11] because they wish you my
[46:14] right as most Crooks get caught they
[46:18] don't want to be a group by themselves
[46:19] because they got that bad conscience
[46:21] thing in them you know
[46:22] they want to tell it to the world and
[46:24] then
[46:25] what was the man out there in Alabama
[46:28] he wanted to make a statement he knew
[46:31] when he went under there with that boy
[46:33] he killed that man he knew he wasn't
[46:34] coming out alive he just wanted to make
[46:36] a statement
[46:38] it's hard I know they never did let him
[46:40] make you stable
[46:43] what you see people don't want to just
[46:45] stay by themselves
[46:48] they want to tell it like I tell
[46:50] Robinson Robbie they don't got a lot of
[46:51] problems Robbie said well that's all
[46:53] right we all have problems see I'm not
[46:55] but I'm sat in the morning I gotta I got
[46:57] somebody this is as bad as I am maybe I
[46:59] kill four guys and he and he only had
[47:01] got a nose somewhere but he's got
[47:03] problems too
[47:05] he said I said they're not sure
[47:10] see because we try to justify our own
[47:12] selves and run it in our own ways
[47:15] come on I hope you wrote like that let's
[47:17] go again
[47:18] and I love that ninth verse If any man
[47:20] happen here right now let him hear
[47:23] but remember he that leads into
[47:25] captivity she'll go into captivity with
[47:28] his Doctrine
[47:29] you watch the people of this message and
[47:32] you see them
[47:33] you know the old saying this you never
[47:36] stand alone right yeah
[47:40] when you look at the doctrine for this
[47:42] message
[47:43] and look what they're doing in the
[47:44] Foreign Fields
[47:46] when those four old people don't have
[47:48] the ability to quote back to them
[47:51] I've been there in the Philippines and
[47:54] they said there's a day when we didn't
[47:55] have a book to argue with them said we
[47:57] was at the mercy of what they were
[47:58] saying wrote around and say it
[48:02] yep think what about him
[48:05] but look
[48:08] if we take the sword we're going to be
[48:10] killed by we know what that means
[48:14] well what about taking the sword of our
[48:15] tongues and trying to kill everybody
[48:17] with it
[48:19] okay
[48:23] we look at verse 11 now we get to the
[48:25] mark of the biggest
[48:26] and I'll be held at another Beast come
[48:28] up out of the Earth
[48:29] he had two horns like a lamb and he
[48:32] expected as a dragon
[48:34] now this one comes up out of the Earth
[48:35] right all right
[48:37] so look what happens
[48:40] coming up out of the earth go ahead with
[48:42] number two while we're not a
[48:43] denomination 1958 927.
[48:47] look what the prophet is talking about
[48:51] Scarlett he's talking about the woman
[48:53] said Upon A Scarlet country Beast and
[48:55] the Bible represents royalty color
[48:57] Scarlet means red and beasts represent
[48:59] power did you notice the bees come up
[49:01] out of the sea now the first one come to
[49:04] power the sea all right
[49:06] that was in the in the revelations the
[49:08] 13th and when you see the Beast coming
[49:10] up out of the sea it meant that this
[49:13] power was raising up among the people
[49:15] because I got one in a minute would run
[49:17] around and even said he said to people
[49:19] from Europe
[49:20] roll it over
[49:25] but in Revelation 13 when this lamb came
[49:29] up
[49:30] you know which was the second beast we
[49:32] just read about where's he come from
[49:34] came up out of the Earth
[49:36] look no people
[49:40] I watched right around when he's so
[49:42] specifically explaining something but do
[49:44] you understand what he's explaining
[49:49] see there was a time there was no people
[49:50] in America now we talk about the Indians
[49:52] was here or this was there or that was
[49:54] our but you know he's talking about
[49:58] you know
[49:59] people we came over here right
[50:03] so there was a time there was no people
[50:07] so this piece is going to raise up out
[50:09] of the Earth
[50:13] you and I
[50:15] are the people
[50:17] so what came about the Earth First Beast
[50:20] come about a sea second beast come down
[50:21] the Earth we just read it in the street
[50:23] no people United States but then after
[50:26] he had been after him he had two little
[50:29] horns see one of the ecclesiastical
[50:31] powers and then he received the powers
[50:34] played like a dragon did before him so
[50:37] you just got to mark it down we're
[50:39] coming into a religious persecution with
[50:42] the same things that they did in Pagan
[50:44] Rome many years ago for it's thus saith
[50:48] the Lord now what is it setting up on a
[50:51] beast of power
[50:53] there we go coming into a religious
[50:57] persecution
[51:01] that's odd he could say thus saith the
[51:02] Lord
[51:03] you see people say we're not going to go
[51:05] through persecution we're going to be
[51:06] taken up I know where the quotes are
[51:08] we're not going to be close enough we're
[51:10] going to be taking her right
[51:13] because of religious persecution is not
[51:15] closing you up
[51:18] right let's just take them taking over
[51:20] and doing nothing right all right but
[51:22] you see what I'm talking about
[51:24] look where he describes the United
[51:25] States on the mark of the beast number
[51:27] three
[51:29] 54 513.
[51:34] and we'll read that
[51:35] read it on down in the 13th chapter of
[51:37] Revelation here look here at a time
[51:41] look here at the 15th verse
[51:43] is where it's not about the Beast you
[51:44] know where
[51:45] and I just a minute I want to go back
[51:48] before that and see and we see your word
[51:51] that he was standing here by the seaside
[51:55] now I want to just find a place where
[51:58] the 11th verse and I beheld another
[52:00] Beast coming up out of the Earth
[52:03] the outer not out of water out of the
[52:07] Earth the first one expanding John the
[52:09] John standing and he seems to come up
[52:12] out of the sea the second we're going to
[52:15] follow the Earth then the statements of
[52:16] multiputed people is look in water then
[52:19] this is where there was no people in the
[52:22] United States
[52:23] now look what he said and he had two
[52:25] horns like a lamb
[52:27] two horns like a lamb not a lamb
[52:32] me
[52:34] what is it our American buffalo
[52:39] God is an animal right
[52:42] purecy there he is two horns like
[52:46] but then what did he do
[52:48] and freedom of religion
[52:54] lamb but remember he never did become an
[52:57] old Ram
[52:59] what did you say
[53:01] he was a lamb this country is only 150
[53:04] years old you know what just the Lambs
[53:07] it's not old enough to be an old Ram
[53:10] now
[53:11] watch this in a second
[53:14] he sprayed like a dragon he ever found
[53:16] all the power first he said before him
[53:18] the red dragon he called all that was in
[53:20] the earth that Drew up on the earth to
[53:21] worship the Beast whose wound was he
[53:24] that everyone was ill and he does great
[53:26] wonders
[53:28] yeah
[53:30] and the next verse on down I believe it
[53:32] is it even says that the Miracles he can
[53:35] perform but look what your Prophet said
[53:37] they are
[53:38] doing makes him a
[53:40] fire
[53:42] told to so to make him a fire come down
[53:44] out of Heaven the atomic bomb
[53:48] sure
[53:49] yeah there ain't some guy standing out
[53:51] there fire come down to heaven
[53:57] you tell me what it is
[53:59] atomic bomb hydrogen bomb intelligent
[54:02] nation and so forth deceiving the
[54:05] Nature's Nations by these things
[54:10] so these things should be coming down
[54:12] into a more simple understanding
[54:17] a prophet saying that is that this Beast
[54:19] has the ability to call down fire see
[54:22] we're looking for some guy to walk out
[54:23] there you know
[54:28] the prophet says it's Atomic power right
[54:32] word Atomic power start
[54:36] jury Russia would do with Japan mainly
[54:40] Germany and Japan was dealing with it
[54:42] that's why we went in there and took
[54:43] those scientists whether you know your
[54:44] history or not we went in there and
[54:46] divided those countries that's why the
[54:48] Berlin Wall was putting or where we
[54:49] could get half the people out of there
[54:51] to be our scientists and they could have
[54:53] the other half
[54:56] see Russia will come in right Russia
[54:59] come in World War II Russia was being
[55:01] defeated up there
[55:03] and we went to the Rain
[55:05] the most sensible thing to have been
[55:07] done in that day was back off and say
[55:09] blowing to pieces and then we'll blow
[55:10] you to pieces right but no we want to
[55:13] help
[55:14] so we went and conquered and gave Russia
[55:16] all the equipment
[55:19] and then we divided the world in law
[55:23] we got the big scientists they got the
[55:26] big signs
[55:29] don't you remember many many years ago I
[55:31] remember this statement was made in the
[55:32] paper see
[55:35] did when they send a rocket this was
[55:37] before but said when they sent a rocket
[55:39] to the moon
[55:40] said
[55:42] two scientists would step out and Shake
[55:44] Hands one from the U.S and one from
[55:47] Russia
[55:49] will step out and shake hands because
[55:51] that's what it is
[55:53] come on church it's just a point of
[55:55] looking at it see the fire coming down
[55:57] out of Heaven is atomies what did they
[55:58] do in World War II
[56:00] they blasted that places
[56:03] Smithereens that's right
[56:05] Gilmore with two bombs and had been
[56:07] killed in a lot of the other times of
[56:09] the war
[56:10] who has power to do that
[56:12] United States
[56:15] who has the ability to do that you know
[56:18] you know I'll drop back your scripture
[56:19] you'll see it
[56:21] I make number four
[56:22] and the answer is not all the power of
[56:24] the first weeks before him and called
[56:25] the Earth and then with their end to
[56:28] worship the Beast whose name the wound
[56:29] was healed this Beast is coming forth
[56:32] the deadly wound was healed begging
[56:34] wrong become powerful wrong you have
[56:36] great wonders show that he make a fire
[56:38] come down from the heaven on the earth
[56:40] and the side of men
[56:42] you think about it
[56:45] see we're over here to where we see
[56:46] things
[56:47] but what if you were in some backwards
[56:50] country to a word that you you would
[56:53] never even maybe seen white people you
[56:54] were living back to Irish as people in
[56:58] the jungle from night what would happen
[57:00] if a helicopter sit down
[57:02] and a guy jumped out with these great
[57:04] big things all around his head and all
[57:07] this suit he had on and then he takes
[57:08] his fire thing and he you know a gun
[57:10] he'd go and just burns a jungle what you
[57:14] think
[57:16] I'd fall down and start worship anymore
[57:18] you do
[57:20] I certainly know a whole lot greater
[57:22] than I am
[57:27] see what he can do
[57:29] he does great wonders making Fire come
[57:33] down from heaven on the earth and the
[57:34] side of me and nuclear stuff
[57:37] think about it
[57:40] and to see with them
[57:43] Miracles which he had power to do in the
[57:46] shot of the Beast
[57:49] these two in the side of the Beast one
[57:52] the image of the Beast you're talking of
[57:55] two beasts right right
[57:57] but it's not released it's one beast and
[58:00] an image to the Beast amen right
[58:04] all right
[58:05] because he describes who the Beast is
[58:09] the one that had the wounded was healed
[58:12] we see the image of the Beast you have
[58:15] power to give life unto the image of the
[58:17] Beast this be strong gave life
[58:23] where did we come from
[58:25] where did we get all of our doctrines
[58:27] and ideas right
[58:30] where did where did it off base though
[58:36] I'm talking Brother Richard this morning
[58:38] and I said well I'm back to eating the
[58:39] cough drops
[58:42] but listen
[58:44] look at number five
[58:46] we'll get a few more questions
[58:49] there'll be two forms of them taken from
[58:51] Oneness of unity
[58:52] 1958-128 paragraph or page 45 portal
[58:57] there'll be two forms of them one form
[59:00] will come from Rome which will be will
[59:02] be the Beast
[59:04] there is an image of the Beast which we
[59:06] will be the ecclesiastical head of the
[59:09] Protestant church
[59:13] keep up as an image unto the Beast under
[59:16] the denominational world
[59:19] they'll all come under one great
[59:22] Dominion
[59:23] and the Antichrist will be the one
[59:25] that's enthroned and seated
[59:27] May understand sits in the temple of
[59:29] God's humans have to be have done right
[59:30] yep
[59:33] enter against
[59:35] almost exactly not but yet his teaching
[59:39] isn't from the scripture another
[59:40] scripture to make it look like that is
[59:42] right it'll be wrong
[59:46] you see we started out over here for
[59:48] Religious Freedom
[59:50] right and then we took their
[59:53] very Doctrine
[59:55] you know
[59:57] right
[59:59] the very Doctrine right he said but I'm
[1:00:02] not a Catholic but I'll tell you what I
[1:00:03] asked my sisters that I told you I said
[1:00:05] what's the difference in the Catholic
[1:00:06] Doctrine and the Baptist she said
[1:00:09] we worship Mary we worship Jesus they
[1:00:12] worship Mary I said uh
[1:00:15] yeah someone
[1:00:18] we'll get dark when we get into the mark
[1:00:20] of the beast
[1:00:22] you realize to have the same Doctrine
[1:00:28] you're the image
[1:00:30] of what you're looking at
[1:00:32] if you have the same Doctrine
[1:00:34] now don't misunderstand this before we
[1:00:37] get down to it
[1:00:40] in the Baptist Church there was a dozen
[1:00:43] splits of different forms of doctrines
[1:00:46] and ideas
[1:00:50] so everybody's not going to say the same
[1:00:52] you understand what I'm getting at
[1:00:55] it's never going to be that everybody
[1:00:56] says the same
[1:00:59] it's just that you go along with it
[1:01:01] because
[1:01:03] you're part of the system
[1:01:05] and you form an image to the Beast which
[1:01:08] means the exact likeness of it
[1:01:10] whatever Doctrine the Beast has you have
[1:01:13] that Doctrine
[1:01:15] that's right
[1:01:20] but when you tell me there's two Lords
[1:01:22] all right
[1:01:25] then you've got two Gods
[1:01:28] you're back like it was at the Nicene
[1:01:30] Council of 325 A.D then when you tell me
[1:01:33] that Jesus wasn't god Till The River
[1:01:35] Jordan right
[1:01:38] then you're saying the same thing they
[1:01:40] did and then I see in councilman 325 A.D
[1:01:42] that's right because that's where they
[1:01:44] were arguing over whether he was the
[1:01:46] same substance or a like substance
[1:01:48] bringing it down to our day that's why I
[1:01:51] tell you what you listen to is up to you
[1:01:55] right I've never told nobody you can't
[1:01:57] listen to somebody else
[1:02:00] but when you bring that back here that's
[1:02:03] right and you start among the people and
[1:02:05] start talking about brother so-and-so's
[1:02:07] got a good thing going then you're going
[1:02:09] to find brother Dale in the Pulpit right
[1:02:10] addressing it right right
[1:02:12] amen okay right because I'm responsible
[1:02:19] for your soul
[1:02:21] because they're not now right I know I'm
[1:02:24] late for me I don't want nobody to leave
[1:02:26] this church whatsoever I never have
[1:02:29] but if you're going to believe somebody
[1:02:30] else's Doctrine go with that Doctrine
[1:02:33] and that person
[1:02:34] amen that's right now you just think you
[1:02:37] know everything no but I know who does
[1:02:40] have all the answers right
[1:02:42] I got a Bible and I got a prophet's
[1:02:45] message amen all right
[1:02:49] do you say well well that's just better
[1:02:51] way of seeing it
[1:02:55] we got one Holy Ghost
[1:03:02] one interpreter of the word all right
[1:03:07] one revealer of the word
[1:03:11] yep well brother that's what I don't
[1:03:13] like about you because you just think
[1:03:14] you're the only one that's got it no
[1:03:16] I've always told you I ain't worried
[1:03:18] about it because ain't other people's
[1:03:20] got it because it's not made for Lula
[1:03:22] ice on me it's made for the Bride of the
[1:03:25] around the world and there's people out
[1:03:28] there that believe the truth amen
[1:03:30] but there's a lot out there that believe
[1:03:33] all kind of perverted doctrines that's
[1:03:35] right that you can have three or four
[1:03:36] wives that you can help this you can
[1:03:38] have that right yeah
[1:03:42] making a good denomination I mean that's
[1:03:44] right we don't make a good denomination
[1:03:47] don't link me with that don't tell me
[1:03:49] one of these days I'm gonna have to sign
[1:03:51] papers to agree that the people of this
[1:03:54] message just got the truth
[1:03:56] I ain't gonna do it
[1:03:59] but what do you mean they got the truth
[1:04:01] nah you didn't listen I said for you to
[1:04:04] make me sign a paper
[1:04:06] to say the message of this people this
[1:04:08] message is not the truth this message is
[1:04:10] the truth amen but the people in this
[1:04:13] message is most perverted people there
[1:04:15] are in the world that's right to believe
[1:04:18] any Doctrine any idea that's right right
[1:04:20] amen
[1:04:22] and then turn around and try to destroy
[1:04:24] the very message
[1:04:27] that's right
[1:04:29] you tell me that ain't the image of the
[1:04:31] Beast
[1:04:32] you tell me this thing ain't reached his
[1:04:34] Apex in this people of the message
[1:04:38] that's right just reached this height in
[1:04:41] this day
[1:04:42] Satan now has
[1:04:44] you know that right around said when
[1:04:46] when baptized that they accepted let's
[1:04:48] see if unquote right when they accepted
[1:04:49] Barabbas instead of Jesus run around and
[1:04:52] said Satan was exalted to the throne he
[1:04:54] always wanted
[1:04:57] personal Warden
[1:05:01] when they accepted Barabbas instead of
[1:05:03] Jesus he said that puts Satan to a
[1:05:05] strong well what do you think it's being
[1:05:07] done now
[1:05:09] but the people have taken this message
[1:05:11] and twisting in it
[1:05:13] and saying to run around and said so and
[1:05:15] so what about if you was at the mercy
[1:05:17] that you had no quotes
[1:05:21] you say well I never would do it
[1:05:24] do it son I've been there
[1:05:27] and talked to people
[1:05:32] that women years ago in a church
[1:05:35] I ain't calling no names
[1:05:37] there was women in that church getting
[1:05:40] ready to see who they was going home
[1:05:41] with that night
[1:05:44] and you know the names if I called them
[1:05:50] because it was being taught to them that
[1:05:53] they're supposed to have a head
[1:05:55] and some of them didn't have a husband
[1:05:57] that the husband could have a whole
[1:06:00] bunch of wives
[1:06:03] because he didn't have enough men to go
[1:06:04] around
[1:06:06] you know
[1:06:09] and you know what I'll lay them back to
[1:06:11] that in The Minister's meeting and you
[1:06:13] know what happened
[1:06:15] the pastor of that church ridiculed me
[1:06:18] and would not speak to me for probably
[1:06:21] five years
[1:06:29] and I saved them from going into
[1:06:31] adultery
[1:06:33] yeah
[1:06:34] that's right that's why my brother
[1:06:36] Dale's tired
[1:06:39] tired of putting up with garbage cans
[1:06:41] it's called this message
[1:06:46] you might be surprised one of these days
[1:06:48] I'm not coming here and start calling
[1:06:49] names of preachers I try to be nice
[1:06:53] but see some of you are listening to
[1:06:55] people that I'm talking about that's
[1:06:57] right
[1:06:59] and you think they're preaching a good
[1:07:00] message
[1:07:05] okay
[1:07:08] image to the Beast
[1:07:13] they look at the neighborhood
[1:07:16] what's your number six
[1:07:19] question and answers 54. 5 15.
[1:07:24] they had said what does the image of the
[1:07:26] beast mean all right
[1:07:28] considers a joint question he goes on
[1:07:30] and answers
[1:07:32] the Bible clearly teaches that the
[1:07:34] Catholic church is the the Beast the
[1:07:37] Bible teaches that obese means a power
[1:07:40] is that right a beast the Bible says
[1:07:42] that the Beast men of power and the
[1:07:45] Beast was the Vatican City
[1:07:47] the Catholic hierarchy all right now
[1:07:50] that was the power of the church that
[1:07:52] was the Beast
[1:07:55] build a Protestant Church come out of
[1:07:58] that of the Catholic church and organize
[1:08:00] himself a little power
[1:08:03] that is an image
[1:08:06] wrote it on that word
[1:08:10] if anything if something was made in my
[1:08:13] image it'd have to look like me it's
[1:08:16] something made in the image of this
[1:08:17] church you'd have to look like the
[1:08:19] church something was made to be made an
[1:08:22] image unto this Beast which was the
[1:08:24] Lutheran right
[1:08:25] right and now I maybe can't pronounce
[1:08:29] some words well that you know look there
[1:08:31] is right methodisms right madnessism
[1:08:35] right Pentecostal instrument isms or as
[1:08:38] it system
[1:08:45] that's what people don't want me to say
[1:08:48] it's okay to throw off on all of them
[1:08:50] over there
[1:08:54] all them is was formed into an
[1:08:56] organization and made an image just like
[1:08:58] the Beast there it is
[1:09:00] now do you say being brother Brown that
[1:09:04] all Catholics all messages and all
[1:09:06] Baptists are gone listen
[1:09:09] I didn't say that
[1:09:14] come on you take a quote up here make
[1:09:16] you say this what he said there's
[1:09:18] thousands and thousands and tens of
[1:09:20] thousands of morning increasing in those
[1:09:21] churches
[1:09:22] but in their organization they're trying
[1:09:25] to drive them to a Creed and they won't
[1:09:27] stand for it in a church when it
[1:09:29] organizes it comes under a Creed
[1:09:34] okay
[1:09:36] now you know what an organization is
[1:09:39] that's my brother remember there's a
[1:09:40] quote similar to this right around said
[1:09:42] you'd never be able to denominate this
[1:09:44] next year but to organize it into lay of
[1:09:46] seal
[1:09:48] because if you denominate it means you
[1:09:50] put up your poster outside you declare
[1:09:51] what you are and you're doing this and
[1:09:53] accept nothing else
[1:09:56] but when you organize it it means you
[1:09:58] got the same spirit
[1:10:03] so the Methodist the Baptist the
[1:10:06] Presbyterian the brand of mites
[1:10:08] they all got the same Spirit of the
[1:10:09] Catholic church and we'll get through
[1:10:11] the image of the beast when it's your
[1:10:12] Doctrine in your forehead right it's in
[1:10:14] the forehead it's not stamp 66.
[1:10:17] nobody wouldn't accept that
[1:10:20] it's your Doctrine in your forehead
[1:10:23] well brother now how do we know you
[1:10:25] better be know one thing for certain
[1:10:29] number one qualifications you better
[1:10:31] have the baptism of the Holy ghosts yes
[1:10:36] if you don't have that don't worry about
[1:10:37] the rest of it no that's right that's
[1:10:39] right you're deceived anyway right
[1:10:42] but mama was good and there's something
[1:10:44] wonderful
[1:10:46] they have their day and their times
[1:10:49] it's not for you and I that's right
[1:10:52] Sam brother Brown said Mama used to
[1:10:55] teach me that that what was it hell was
[1:10:57] eternal or different Doctrine or
[1:10:59] something that he was on he said I don't
[1:11:01] believe that no more right
[1:11:03] he was born awful mama that's right
[1:11:07] come on
[1:11:10] a thousands and ten thousands of
[1:11:13] Christians exactly
[1:11:15] all right let me see if I can find these
[1:11:18] over here all right hang on just a
[1:11:20] minute
[1:11:22] so you can see what I got and that's
[1:11:24] just that's not even the fourth of
[1:11:26] what's living in office when the image
[1:11:28] would be just run it in image of the
[1:11:29] Beast our image to the Beast our image
[1:11:32] unto the leaves let's run into computer
[1:11:34] let's see if I can find it right
[1:11:37] all right Hey Brother Anderson jumped to
[1:11:41] 14.
[1:11:43] I'm gonna give them
[1:11:46] no
[1:11:51] this is from the Seal of God preached
[1:11:53] 1954 5 14. you remember why I'm giving
[1:11:56] the dates remember that because
[1:11:58] sometimes they don't have the
[1:12:00] Jeffersonville up there so I gave you
[1:12:02] the date at least you can know what it
[1:12:03] is watch very said let us in the United
[1:12:06] States they said let us make an image
[1:12:08] unto the base if the Beast with the
[1:12:10] power the power was an organization not
[1:12:12] taking Theory now that's the word of God
[1:12:14] the organization of the Catholic Church
[1:12:16] organized himself together and make a
[1:12:20] agree and they accept what they call the
[1:12:22] early fathers together
[1:12:25] you go back and like I said while I
[1:12:27] don't run around to you say that the
[1:12:29] Catholic church is the first church you
[1:12:31] sit there and exactly right
[1:12:34] these
[1:12:36] they put my words do you know that the
[1:12:38] Catholic Church
[1:12:41] was the first people going out with the
[1:12:43] truth but
[1:12:46] do you understand what he's saying
[1:12:48] that's my wordings
[1:12:51] but then it got perverted
[1:12:54] organize yourself together May the agree
[1:12:56] exactly what they call the early fathers
[1:12:58] completely accept the in their
[1:13:01] teachings you know the the Bible and the
[1:13:04] thing and organizers came to the church
[1:13:06] and made a ritual in what they believed
[1:13:07] and what they would teach a universal
[1:13:10] belief and they forced it to the People
[1:13:12] by punishment now you know then what
[1:13:14] happened in the Dark Ages how they
[1:13:15] killed the people all right now
[1:13:18] then we come out of it with Martin
[1:13:19] Luther but look what he says about
[1:13:21] Martin Luther
[1:13:22] and then when Martin Luther come out
[1:13:24] seeing the spirit of God leading him out
[1:13:27] instead of letting the people stay free
[1:13:30] he organized the church
[1:13:35] an image like unto the Beast a political
[1:13:38] power locking into it instead of letting
[1:13:41] the peoples walk as God gives light they
[1:13:44] organize under a
[1:13:46] discipline and they have to stay to that
[1:13:50] discipline you go to some Churches and
[1:13:53] you join them
[1:13:54] you're going to a certain period of new
[1:13:57] age
[1:13:58] everybody in here that's ever been
[1:14:00] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:14:02] Christ
[1:14:03] all right if you go to a Baptist church
[1:14:06] today you could go to a Methodist or
[1:14:08] Presbyterian of Pentecostals and they
[1:14:09] wouldn't argue
[1:14:11] but if you go to the Baptist Church it
[1:14:13] is their Doctrine you got to go and be
[1:14:15] re-baptized Father Son and Holy Ghost in
[1:14:18] the Baptist Church
[1:14:21] now you're not going into the church
[1:14:25] you see they got rules set up what's the
[1:14:27] difference in that kitchen people you
[1:14:29] got to speak in drama right
[1:14:31] right
[1:14:32] you got to speak in tongues of how the
[1:14:34] Holy Ghost right what's the difference
[1:14:36] that's a discipline or a Doctrine or an
[1:14:39] idea what's the thing of the people in
[1:14:40] that do you believe the prophets met you
[1:14:42] that means you got the Holy Ghost
[1:14:47] my uncle devil believes it so he got it
[1:14:52] but he don't believe like I do I'll
[1:14:54] agree with you that's right he believes
[1:14:55] the truth and you don't
[1:14:59] hurt but
[1:15:01] all right
[1:15:02] you say you shouldn't be that way
[1:15:04] another day why not
[1:15:06] why not be that way look look on go
[1:15:09] around to uh
[1:15:10] what do we get going up it's on uh
[1:15:13] number 15 which is actually a
[1:15:15] continuation but nothing but in the Seal
[1:15:18] of God same message God moved right out
[1:15:20] into the mess of the church the mess in
[1:15:22] this church had a Revival that swept the
[1:15:24] world the holy spirit with them teaching
[1:15:26] sanctification and the first thing you
[1:15:28] know when they did that then they
[1:15:30] organized the church making an image
[1:15:32] unto the Beast
[1:15:35] that's right a political organized power
[1:15:38] we're Divine the people of God to agree
[1:15:40] instead of being free to worship and
[1:15:42] walk in the light as light was shown on
[1:15:45] their path
[1:15:48] think about it
[1:15:51] an image to the Beast
[1:15:56] that Beast bred around and said rose up
[1:15:58] in America there's one in here where he
[1:15:59] said
[1:16:00] they brought it from Europe
[1:16:03] that was one of the first comes up out
[1:16:05] of the sea all right we had to come over
[1:16:07] here by the ocean
[1:16:10] but then the image of the Beast was put
[1:16:12] right here
[1:16:14] and you realize that we have that
[1:16:16] Doctrine we're just as much Catholic as
[1:16:18] anybody in the world that's right
[1:16:23] just as much
[1:16:25] do you see why I'm so
[1:16:29] hard I guess
[1:16:31] because I've got to be protective
[1:16:34] of your soul
[1:16:36] okay
[1:16:38] amen now
[1:16:41] brother animal
[1:16:43] feminish motor what is that word that
[1:16:46] you use you know was he against women
[1:16:49] no no
[1:16:51] he went against women right
[1:16:55] he's against the wrong kind all right
[1:16:57] was he against churches no
[1:17:01] how many quotes do you want where he
[1:17:02] says go to these denominations
[1:17:06] and let your light shine
[1:17:09] a quote yeah let me just quote it for
[1:17:12] you
[1:17:13] he said let your light Chinese because
[1:17:15] they'll run you out
[1:17:25] do you see what I'm talking about
[1:17:28] just keep reading till you get all the
[1:17:30] answers right amen any quote by itself
[1:17:33] is a death to you that's right
[1:17:36] um
[1:17:37] let's see Church we've formed an image
[1:17:40] to the Beast
[1:17:41] here in America
[1:17:44] we have the material of power to control
[1:17:46] the world
[1:17:48] and we have the ability to send quotes
[1:17:53] message books Bibles
[1:17:56] and thanks to the world right
[1:17:59] and all that's good because it's finding
[1:18:01] the life seed and I'm all 100 for it
[1:18:05] right
[1:18:06] but it's just like I told the brother
[1:18:10] you've heard me before say it
[1:18:13] and it come out later
[1:18:16] I said you've been to these places and
[1:18:18] you've set up and done these things
[1:18:21] I'll try to work my word wasn't going to
[1:18:23] be so bad
[1:18:25] but they try to
[1:18:26] you know take in a doctrine of the
[1:18:28] message and produce wrote around was a
[1:18:30] prophet isn't that in the other that's
[1:18:31] wonderful
[1:18:33] but I said now what are you going to do
[1:18:35] next year when you go back to the same
[1:18:36] people right
[1:18:38] you got 200 this year next year you got
[1:18:40] 400. are you going to set that 200 and
[1:18:42] ain't heard nothing but right around was
[1:18:44] a profit are you going to set them down
[1:18:47] and make them go through this same thing
[1:18:49] again
[1:18:51] I said that ain't even sensible I said
[1:18:53] take that 200 and put them over to the
[1:18:55] side and let somebody teach them
[1:18:58] the prophet said okay the message came
[1:19:00] back I believe it was China
[1:19:03] I'm pretty sure it is when it came back
[1:19:05] later of saying this since you've told
[1:19:07] us that God sent a prophet now come and
[1:19:10] tell us what he taught
[1:19:13] I'm 100 for going and doing but
[1:19:16] I'm not going back to the same church
[1:19:18] next year and preach the same day
[1:19:21] message I preached that year
[1:19:27] I think we ought to be in growth
[1:19:29] development
[1:19:32] man you say well what do you mean I mean
[1:19:34] simply this I've been to these countries
[1:19:37] a few of them if I go back to any of
[1:19:40] those countries I'll try to progress in
[1:19:42] the message
[1:19:43] try to teach them deeper into the
[1:19:45] message I think that ought to be done
[1:19:48] you want to go tell them about the
[1:19:49] message but tell them what the prophet
[1:19:51] talk right then once you tell them they
[1:19:53] can fight these false doctors
[1:19:58] but until you tell them and give them
[1:19:59] the books and the things they can't
[1:20:01] fight with them and you know what it
[1:20:03] means give them to books
[1:20:05] if you don't give them somebody to teach
[1:20:08] them what's in the book
[1:20:10] you're netting the first reader
[1:20:13] you know what I mean by that see dick
[1:20:16] run see John run see this See Spot
[1:20:22] and you just get ready to see spot
[1:20:24] that's perfect
[1:20:26] we'll take somebody let them take some
[1:20:28] more books right let them explain the
[1:20:30] message in detail
[1:20:32] where they could fight the doctrines
[1:20:34] that are around them that's right
[1:20:36] that's all I've ever tried to say
[1:20:40] but you know what I've never been
[1:20:41] invited to go back
[1:20:46] because I made that statement
[1:20:49] that I thought to order progress in
[1:20:51] their teaching yeah
[1:20:53] but see I've never been invited to go
[1:20:55] back to that countries with anybody
[1:20:58] because they still think all it is to go
[1:21:00] around was a profit but around was a
[1:21:02] profit
[1:21:03] yep
[1:21:06] and then you sat there and marchy
[1:21:08] tongues and hear him say that brother
[1:21:10] rather was when it comes to John hope
[1:21:12] Atmos
[1:21:18] I don't know what I'm sorry
[1:21:21] I just can't see that
[1:21:29] you see Church
[1:21:31] the truth
[1:21:34] is hard to preach
[1:21:36] alive is easy to breathe that's right
[1:21:39] you'll get people to leave a lot on
[1:21:40] locker and you can believe the truth
[1:21:44] truth requires you to study
[1:21:47] lives requires you to listen
[1:21:51] to these things what about an image to
[1:21:53] the Beast right
[1:21:56] you mean you're talking about brother
[1:21:58] Dale that the people of this message
[1:22:02] will you show me where this
[1:22:07] thing in with the people of this message
[1:22:08] come on well then don't you think Satan
[1:22:10] is right here right
[1:22:14] what do you think he's using his intro
[1:22:20] it wasn't about Napoleon it wasn't it
[1:22:22] him which one was it that had the spot
[1:22:24] which was uh Sweden and I think right
[1:22:27] with it
[1:22:28] and he didn't want to talk about that
[1:22:30] place because there's one place he
[1:22:31] couldn't conquer
[1:22:34] Que
[1:22:37] the one place
[1:22:39] see Satan can't conquer the people of
[1:22:41] this message I'm not worried about that
[1:22:42] because truth's gonna come right God's
[1:22:45] going to raise up these young men like
[1:22:46] take over and preach because that's
[1:22:48] older Wonder dying going off
[1:22:53] and he'll bring the crook that's right
[1:22:54] somebody's going to make this message
[1:22:56] live
[1:22:58] not just talk about it not argue and
[1:23:00] fuss about it come on
[1:23:03] that's right
[1:23:04] somebody's going to take the message and
[1:23:06] become the message when I brought it
[1:23:08] that way
[1:23:09] out on the street corners and proclaim
[1:23:12] the message if you want to yeah
[1:23:15] that's a good idea
[1:23:21] but just make sure you tell the truth
[1:23:22] out there right right
[1:23:26] make sure you tell the truth doctor
[1:23:29] all right
[1:23:32] come on because it reflects back to here
[1:23:35] right and they say is that what you
[1:23:38] teach up there yeah
[1:23:42] I appreciate my mother-in-law
[1:23:46] it was somebody said something about it
[1:23:48] well up there where brother Dale did
[1:23:49] that or and all this stuff they just
[1:23:52] believe in beating their wives and
[1:23:53] everything else
[1:23:55] they asked my mother-in-law about it
[1:23:56] because they knew that
[1:23:59] I was her son-in-law you know and was
[1:24:02] preaching here
[1:24:03] she said I'll tell you one thing
[1:24:07] Sam Dale ain't gonna do that
[1:24:11] the last night y'all actually had that
[1:24:12] much confidence right
[1:24:15] she said he won't do that
[1:24:17] do it you know kind of ends the gospel
[1:24:20] don't it you ever notice it's really bad
[1:24:23] when you when you got something you want
[1:24:24] to tails up to everybody and nobody
[1:24:26] would want to hear it that's right
[1:24:29] you got some good gossip and you run
[1:24:31] among the neighbors and they say I
[1:24:33] already heard it
[1:24:35] turns you up
[1:24:41] you just want to go home and cry
[1:24:47] I'll jerk
[1:24:48] this message is not to be arguing first
[1:24:51] about it
[1:24:52] bring it into manifestation let the
[1:24:55] people do the manifestation then one
[1:24:57] thing about it they can't argue about it
[1:25:00] listening
[1:25:02] they can't argue the point because they
[1:25:04] will see it living right right
[1:25:08] we're going to send some prayer claws up
[1:25:11] to
[1:25:16] the baby there and
[1:25:19] we just want to
[1:25:21] everybody to pray and believe that it's
[1:25:23] all going to be all right so let's put
[1:25:25] some in here now for Amy and Jeffrey and
[1:25:29] put one in the babies and then there's
[1:25:31] just one Spire left over and kissing
[1:25:32] needed but we were there the other night
[1:25:35] and
[1:25:38] um just Gwen's mother there were some
[1:25:41] people having trouble over on the side
[1:25:43] there and we never didn't know what the
[1:25:46] trouble was but with no business of ours
[1:25:48] she said Sam said you need to go with
[1:25:51] her and pray with them people that
[1:25:53] they're having troubles so what he
[1:25:56] followed me we just walked over there
[1:25:58] and
[1:25:59] I should I'm a minister
[1:26:02] you know and I said they said that there
[1:26:04] was maybe some problems and honey we all
[1:26:07] need somebody to pray with you
[1:26:09] well they didn't jump up no blessed
[1:26:12] Garden one of them said see we've done
[1:26:14] parade with the chaplain I said okay I
[1:26:17] was just this woman you know volunteer
[1:26:20] my services
[1:26:21] Lloyd said this is my pastor here simply
[1:26:25] you see I wasn't wanting to make no big
[1:26:27] light and I didn't I just went on over
[1:26:29] and said I am but they thanked me for
[1:26:33] coming over there and saying that
[1:26:36] but I don't think they thought I was a
[1:26:38] bad age you know
[1:26:47] you see we don't have to scream and
[1:26:49] holler at the world just be ourselves
[1:26:53] you just do that and then the more take
[1:26:56] care of you so let's join hands together
