========================================

the money collected you all have done a wonderful job as a church we're going to start allocating These funds we've far surpassed the need for those few things so we've collected as a church this has nothing to do with the church funds this is what you have handed me and I put in my pocket Hallelujah fifty four hundred and ten dollars as of this morning thank you and I don't have anything but candy in my pocket so the show for it fifty four hundred and ten dollars plus the church is sending three thousand dollars to build that addition to that church so that's going to be 8 410 we're going to send over there to my oh and we're we're sending brother Leto we're sending him a hundred dollars a month the one I told you that did all the work in Palawan actually praise God I got an email from Brother uh um what's your brother Royal thank you got an email from Brother Royal Friday they went back over to Palawan and baptized three denominational pastors out of that meeting so thank God for that and they're going back in a week or the next week and they're going to preach in those three denominational churches the message of the hour so that's wonderful hey 3 out of 15. that's wonderful and that's just something that has has immediately said they wanted to be baptized and wanted to hear the message of the hour so out of that 60 60 denominational people 15 contacted them back three of them's been baptized already so just keep praying that those full churches and then according to your help we're going to send them this is a way that that that I think we should do it just I want to get it approved by you but they only needed 15 tablets well we got enough what you handed me to send them 26 tablets so we're going to send them 26 tablets and they can distribute that out to the uh to the brothers over there and to whoever they see fit but also we have that one for the brother Edwards church and there's another brother Rudy that needs about twelve hundred dollars well if we give him that to finish his church because his church is finished in the front but it's totally open in the back there's nothing there's no wall there's no anything and they still have church service so brother Royal said if you we could allocate 1200 of that which still leaves 310 dollars left over that we ain't got anything to give to so I'm just going to send it over there and tell them to use it as they see fit but I want to thank you as a church percent for giving me personally fifty four hundred and ten dollars besides what the church is going to send over that but God bless you if anybody

that was given to us for her birthday and thanks for all of the food that was fixed it was marvelous you know I tried to eat as much as I could but I found out I couldn't eat it all but I appreciate every bit of it all of it was great and wonderful you know had a wonderful time and now when we get through there is cake and ice cream to all to go downstairs when we get through and eat a little cake and ice cream okay so we just make sure you do that all right remember the announcements brother Aaron will be preaching the Lord willing this Wednesday so remember him and then remember that on May the 6th brother prakash which is a Wednesday night will be here speaking and also remember the Fourth of July cookout time together in the service on Saturday evening at six o'clock make sure we keep saying that or you'll remember it at six o'clock in July because that'll be our July time together all right that's all of the announcements uh yeah I guess it's all everything we appreciate all of everything that you do and we had a wonderful time I say again yesterday and thank you for fixing the food the doings and the things together that we Fellowship together and had a good time in the Lord just sitting around fellowshipping together you know I like that all right scripture reading Revelations 1 12-15 and the same as we read this morning John 3 1 through 10. father we thank you for your grace thank you for everything Lord thank you that Lord you would give an opportunity to a group of people to be able to hear your word and that we could accept that and believe that you're speaking to us and about us and directing Us in the light of your love and your grace here in the end time we pray that you would hasten the day to finish all of this up because we're not glorying in trying to end all things because we know the horrible things that goes with it but we glory in the fact that we will be with thee and gathered around the throne to be your people we thank him we love you Lord we ask you to just bless and guide each one now and keep us in Jesus name we've been reading Revelations one here for a while and I turned to see the voice that spoke with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks One Life unto the son of man clothed the Garment down to the foot and gird about the pouch with a golden girdle his head and his hires were white like wool as white as snow in his eyes where's the flame of fire and his feet likened to find Bryce as if they burned in a furnace and his voice says to sound many Waters all right we thank the Lord for showing us the truth of that we can read the book of Revelations and understand it and go back then and tie it together with all the others so we'll go to John 3 . there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou has that thou doest except God be with him and Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus saith unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born and Jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born to the flesh his flesh and that which is born of the spirit is Spirit Marvel not that I say it unto thee you must be born again you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now I pray that you'll help me and we'll carry on and go through the service this afternoon and doing it like some of them said it'd be hard to stay awake because of eating so much and things and and all like that well if you do we'll just take a break I'll just take a nap with you and we'll finish up and get through with all things that was a wonderful meal we really appreciate it we have some of the best cooks in the world and I don't say that with any reserve or throwing off on anybody else it's just I believe it that we do and and to appreciate the getting together and and fellowshipping around the food now we were speaking this morning of why you must be born again all right seemingly like a very simple message but remember the prophet in his explain explaining it he said it was a deep thought because it was his first Doctrine the first message that he brought of you know showing there was other little things happened you know and the different parts of doings but as far as a sermon that was his first sermon to tell a bunch of religious people who no marks against him or you could have killed them in a lot of situations especially the high priest um the things like that that you could put in the line there to spend years speaking about and as I said this morning then him uh bragging so much on Jesus that we know that you've got to be of God and yet after it was all finished I believe if he'd have said to Nicodemus he said now Nicodemus you're a good man and what you need to do is you need to you need to give a big offer into the church you know well he would have probably just whipped out his you know money and laid it down wouldn't have been any problem if it would have been anything to have done without for a month or whatever to do you know he would have been Overjoyed to do that but when a man would tell you that you thought you were I mean tell you and you thinking that you were born correct and I've always since I've heard the prophet's message and begin to understand the serpent seed and you know the seed of the serpent the things and in reading the Bible I believe those Pharisees knew what happened in the garden I don't think they were blind to a lot of the things that we speak of even with the the man that was up at brother biscoll's and he said um the garden and the act of of uh you know taking place in the garden he said that's known you thought he said but to think about something like that it was the Beast you know and Eve he said that gives us something to think about you know I believe they understood because they would say to Jesus we're not born a fornication and why would they lay so heavily on the fact of circumcision and the realization as we were talking to the sister last night about it the in the realization that was placed upon mankind the doings and the things and how and then to turn around and eventually tell the man that the man had to be circumcised you know well then it you know everything mounts up to the situation of seeing that they're all related together and I I believe it I mean I'm honest I believe that that when you know they knew that that and they I believe they believed that circumcision brother Brown said that old Jew would tell you said now you know I'll just take you and show you you know he believed in it he had ever hoped he had laid on it other sign of circumcision because he wouldn't dilate his child go without it being circumcised you remember that even when Abraham going down you know I mean not Abraham um Moses going down you know and was fixing to leave because he'd kind of drifted away from the strict point of doing of following the traditions and he was getting ready to go down take over to Egypt and hadn't even circumcised his own son you know and and the angel was fixing to kill him and you said well it wouldn't have killed I wouldn't want to argue with an angel Lord do you you know I'm not going to say you're not going to kill me I don't know I'm not going to argue with him and uh see but he had to perform the sign of circumcision that was a very different thing you remember in the time there that one of the girls uh was uh you know taken by an outsiding country man a different group and you remember and he wanted her for a wife well you know they agreed he did the man did to kind of let it be okay because you know I do but they made a stipulation sit down the only way that you'll ever showing you the very importance of what they thought of is it the only way you'll ever settle this case now the daughter the old man you remember told who that Jacob forever which one of it was the No Man's Daddy he said but y'all gonna have to be circumcised that was a Shameless disgrace well you know how they done and more boys kind of used the time and they circumcised all those people well they just went in there while they were sore and having trouble they just went in there killed all of them well the daddy was upset about it but he kind of got over it because he knew that really they was right you know but that they laid so much honor so much on that circumcision I believe now this is me okay I'll tell you when I it's when I say I believe something I will definitely tell you I believe it all right I believe that they believed that circumcision done away with the seed of the serpent because it would have been a cleansing Factor in the things you know of doing and now that's just personal you take whatever you want to about it I've never read or run around said that but I never read where he didn't say it so all right definitely he said to be my idea but the point is telling religious leaders who believed in their uh at least their following of traditions and the following of the letter of the word until they believed that they were pure and righteous they believed they were right they would believe that they were and you know what they were the chosen people of God Jesus never argued with him about it he praised them for that point and saying that that's who they were they were the people of God all right and the thing that made it bad was when they turned down the god of the word that they claimed to be following would then naturally you know he had to turn against them but now you think about it great religious leader but tell that religious leader something he'd never thought of in his life he had studied the word and I remember listening to those Brothers uh from when brother biscal had him up there from Rabbi Richmond and gershom Solomon and I picked up a thought through that they uh studied a lot of things and talking to brother Bissell and them about what they had said see those people were not just sitting down every day reading and reading and reading they've done that yeah but they talked about things and discuss the things among themselves you know of what the Bible was talking about and like I said if if Jesus would have asked Nicodemus Nicodemus will you give me all the scriptures pertaining to the coming of the Messiah he would have just rolled them off you know he would have went right through the the Virgin conceiving it went right through you know the things that would have been there because they understood that they were looking forward to that all right and you know that would be their their point but yet he didn't say it like that he said you must be born again all right then in saying it like that we know that why we must be born again as we talked about this morning then what that we were born a hybrid condition from Eve sin and the sin was between Satan and Eve that brought the fall and that was the worser part of it than it actually the ACT between the Beast and Eve to bring forth Cain see the worst part was the uh the fact of Eve receiving the unbelief and then when she does even Paul comes on later that Satan might not tempt us as he did through Eve through his satility it was a warning there all right and in doing that it put us in a place called Death right now then until something took place to change that it didn't matter how good you were in the Old Testament remember they went to a place called Paradise when they died all right now in going to that place of paradise it was a place of the bosom of Abraham as we call it scripturally all right not meaning the badly or the inwards of Abraham it was the faith of Abraham it was Abraham's belief in God it provided a place to work that they would have a place to abide all right when they passed away because they're all looking forward as we're reading a little bit they were looking to the cross right and that was wonderful they had the blood of bulls and goats to cover for their sins they had the atonements to be made they had all of that but see you and I are not looking say to the cross I love the way run around and said it I'll read it he said they look to the cross he said we look through the cross now what does he mean see now you got to answer something what does it mean see you would probably say looking through the cross no see to me it doesn't matter if I look back that way I can see the beginning if I look through the cross I can see the atonement I can see all that took place back there back through the atonement through the cross and that way then I can surely know where we are now so it was a great way for him to say it I remember that thought it thought I mean I sometimes it amazes me I wish I could talk like he did I'm kind of like that fella you know about the when the atom bomb went off and a great big smoke went up and the old Indian talked in in sign language you know smoked languages and that old big that we ending was standing there watching when that great atom bomb went off and the great big mushroom went up he looked he said man I wish I'd have said that so I'm just kind of like that I wish I could say like brother Branham does because it looked like he'd say you know we look to the Cross or something or we're on the other side of the Cross explaining you don't go and but he said they looked to the Cross we looked through the cross what does it matter whether you look that away or look that away either way you're coming back to the beginning to a wonderful situation to understand all right but see being born between the mess up of Eve that brought death to the human race then no matter what and you'll see why that I don't agree with the lineages I can follow lineages through the Bible I can take those things but you know people that want to follow lineages and they want to follow it like they'll say whether I was Judah and Tamar to continue a lineage I had to continue to limit lineage but you know what brother Ryan said he said that was adultery you know what he said he said adultery can't be a predestinating seed now argue with him all you want to see it puts it in a different situation but it's like I said this morning I wouldn't care if you could run my lineage all the way back and find out I was a direct descendant from Cain coming down through the lines it wouldn't bother me at all because that has nothing to do with a new birth if you try to make it anything you've got a problem you try to make it any lineage is there anything you got a problem just make it where it was because you look back through your lineages are not too good you remember see you run around and said in the church age book many were the flaws of those coming down you can't find the one in there without flaws you got a problem so stay away from those type of things because that's why I said I don't agree with lineage is that a way to try to say that if I was born of a certain lineage I can be saved because I don't care if I could come directly from Cain down to where I am today I believe in the atonement and the salvation it is offered to all mankind all right and I believe that's why we must need to be born again see we must be born and now if you're going to be born again and the only one that could explain that uh would be the Lord Jesus himself all right because no one else knew how to explain that now come on the prophets themselves could speak of they could prophesy they could say the messiah's coming they could say the things the law Giver would become from Judah they could determine the place of it coming the different things but they not a one of those Prophets never come right down to speaking of that new birth even the greatest of all which was John the Baptist to receive the Holy Ghost six months before he's born or three months or something before he's born you know yet the least in the kingdom is greater than he well you know that doesn't belittle because he was the introducer now brother Branham coming on over on this side see that's why to me when it says you have been given a greater gifts you remember that why because he was a born-again believer whereas the other prophets were not I'm talking about the Old Testament now you're talking about Paul and coming down into the new he was a born-again Believer he was a church-aged messenger he was a promise prophet of the word right but yet he was worth nothing until he received that new birth and he was born to prophet but that that wouldn't have been he would you know there's a Doctrine not too far over the road over here that years ago was out that brother Branham Was An Old Testament prophet in the New Testament age although that didn't sound good you know I mean it is oh it is beautiful now that you could they could just line it up and and it just sounds so great and I thought an Old Testament prophet he'd be a lawgiver because it couldn't be anything else you put him in a new testament age you have a law Giver without salvation I didn't realize what they were saying but that's all right in simple terminologies do you realize what Jesus was saying he's saying that there's nothing here on Earth may I go over in the Book of Revelations and and declare it from there that there's no man worthy to take the book the prophets you know he said it like this he said the prophets were standing there the sages were standing there he says there's there was no one worthy to take the book John says all right see then there was no man Worthy or no no man that could bring a new birth it would have to be someone and the prophet said God came himself he didn't send the son all right now in doing that then it would come to the bases that no mankind is worthy whatsoever of performing a new birth even describing it it would take the one who could give it to be able to explain it all right and he was the only one that could explain it because he was the only one that would be able to give it right all right and he didn't give it right then when he was even explaining through the Matthew the mark the Luke the John he never gave the new birth right then he was preparing them to a place to receive it later but isn't it amazing to just think of the Simplicity of what it is he was not of this world Jesus Christ was not of this world sure he was a human being life and living here right okay but he was not of this world and you know what he said you're not of this world but see he was totally not of this world was well then would there be any problem when he would say you must be born again and I'm trying to lay down a situation with both of these messages for you to think it made it even more confusing to Nicodemus for him to say what he said because we read it as you know well it says you he said you must be born again all right but now remember what I said this morning that was what we read in What's called the English language you know do you know what that original says in the emphatic dyglot if not anyone may be born from above not is able to see the kingdom of God now would you understand that that's the original translation that's the original English straight in from from the Greek or the Hebrew average one of you because that's your reasonable see if not anyone may be born from above not is able to see the kingdom of God and that puts it more confusing than any doesn't it then when it was put over into the King James it came about except a man be born again all right now what are you saying brother Dale I believe no I know we we use other Bibles and reading things but that's all right I have as many of them as I can find I've actually got one book that's got 26 translations and I'm talking about different translations from way back uh new in new English any kind of doing I've actually got them and I compare them I compare this and I believe it's Knox that brought the correct it down to where it says You must be born from above all right now that would be even more confusing as I said Nicodemus could understand him if he said do this give that go do this go do something he was okay I've been after all these other things might as well do that too you know and uh but when he said you must be born again he was literally saying You must be born from above well how would you like to explain to people how would you like to even now now we're not no reflection of churches but how would you like to explain to a good Baptist Church and tell them the original says You must be born from above without giving them a long lengthy part of telling them what the other scriptures are related well see it was really confusing to Nicodemus I can understand this part but he said from above now what's this guy talking about what's the problem see literally Jesus was saying to him in the completed thought that you would be getting the Nicodemus it won't do you no good to enter into your mother's womb and be born again that way I'm not talking about that I'm talking about that you must be born from above because that's where I came from and if you're going to be in anything in my kingdom because the kingdom of God is not anything natural right the disciples couldn't understand that now to show you how far they missed it what did they say when they got over an ax right before the coming of the Holy Ghost after they've done seen his resurrection after they've done seen all other things what did he say are you going to restore the kingdom to Israel at this time they still had their thoughts after following Jesus for three and a half years and seeing him raised and seeing all the things that had happened they still were thinking as the prophet said of a natural Kingdom they thought that they were that Jesus was going to throw the Romans off and take over and and they'd be victorious right so I'm getting it to a point to try to get you to think of really it is mass confusion to the human mind truly as we get to it in a minute the prophet will say the new birth is a mystery truly it is a mystery how can we Earthly people be born from another world are we in a Superman situation was this Jesus like Superman that all the kids would know about that he came from this planet of Krypton and he came down with superhuman powers and you know the X-ray Visions the faster than the speeding bullets you know able to leak buildings with a single bound you know you know what though those people picked that idea up from Jesus coming because Superman come from another world and Jesus seemed to be saying he was coming from another world and you know what he did and he says you can't see you can't understand the kingdom and if you can't understand it then the other part of the scripture will be right you can't enter you can't enter the kingdom unless you're born again unless you're born from above unless you have a supernatural birth it wouldn't have helped Nicodemus to went back 10 times to his mom's wound they would not have changed nothing but for him to think about this man we know that God is with him we know he's done these miracles we know that no man can do those things but now he's speaking languages that we have no ability to understand let me see if I can find one that I loved when I was looking at it uh yeah um Brothers go up to quote number eight quote number eight which is why I'm against organized religion of 1962 1111 e paragraph one one one Drew one one three and look what he says Rolling On Up the art of Master in Israel and can't even understand what the new birth is now watch what he puts it on the reason he don't understand what if you have if you would have kept away from them traditions and held onto the word you'd have known that I was coming to give men New Birth the letter had already declared it Ezekiel speaks of the new heart the new spirit the new thing Moses spoke of the inward man Solomon to Davis the Psalms and writings right and look you'd have known I was coming to give new men New Birth you'd have knowed my day and if you're a node Moses you to have knowed me Moses spoke of me and said I would come and here I am what about it if you'd have stayed away from the traditions the doctrines the ideas of mankind you would have known that I was coming to give man a new birth now listen real careful because of what I was speaking of the other week those Jews knew of his coming right they knew it was coming they knew the prophecies and one group had it figured out he's coming this way another group hadn't figured out coming this way they had all kind of ways figured out one group had him come in maybe as a baby another group having him coming as a grown man all kind of different situations because they knew about that but not a one of them knew his real purpose was to give his own life they didn't know that they didn't know that he was coming to give his own life and that was the only way that they could be anything was to be born again and born from where he was born from because that's what we are you want scripture does it not say it that when you receive the new birth does not Paul emphatically state that you are now what resurrected sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus the prophet said you're already right but that's the inward man right it's not the outward Parts not the body and spirit that's the soul of mankind see we're going to get into these things but the main things that I'm wanting you to follow me is to look at this the point of the things talked about by the prophet that relates to it to show why this is and then you'll go back to your original and look if you've got a Scofield bible you just uh look over in the middle about halfway down your line and you'll see this is it means born from above is the original translation born from where God came from I remember brother moak used to preach on a message years ago and how that what was it now Heaven and Earth kissed you know that in the scripture when God and man become one upon Earth Heaven and Earth kissed and embraced I used to enjoy that I can still remember a lot of messages but let's just read a few because I don't want you to think it's just my thoughts and that I could read something and you could read something from the Greek to say this or something like that but to try to get the thought or concept of something into your mind is my goal to think about we are Earthly people doomed lost and on the way to hell I don't care how good you think you are what you think you are who you think you are even the Old Testament prophets would be lost without the blood of Jesus Christ they had their salvation for their days and the time that sealed them in until the coming of the Messiah but remember they were looking to the Cross so they had to depend upon that and he had to go to down to paradise and bring Paradise up because that would be the the situation to to bring them out of that position they were in because they were not able to move themselves but let's just read a few look what he says on the oncoming storm number one brother we'll read a few and then we'll just get to our thoughts this is taken from the oncoming storm paragraph 81 60 1960 229. all right he's talking about while they're getting it up that his wife was telling him you know and they went to this and they went ahead and wondered why the new wings and he says uh they are Americans she said well aren't we I said no we just live here but we've been born from above the Holy Spirit come upon us born from above see he knew what it was talking about therefore we are prison strangers here this is not a roboting place but we're seeking the city to come who's building micro is God therefore when you are born of above you have the Holy Spirit coming down from God that changes your nature no matter your sister your mother your best friend could be dressed up but the Christians don't a Christian that's born of the spirit of God is born from above and their spirit is of another kingdom oh I'm so glad to hear of that the simpleness of the Holy Spirit to follow it watch how it behaves itself you must be born from above it wouldn't do us any good to beat you you know we can change a new life you know you come up at New Year you say well I'm going to make a resolution and then you're gonna break it before that day's over brother Brandon was listening to him the other night he said I used to watch my daddy he said he'd take that plug of the backer and said he'd sling that plug of the backer you know he's gonna quit said he'd swing it out said didn't even watch where it went he said cause he's gonna go get it right this is not changing her mind or our thoughts because that would not be any good then you'll see why that maybe one day it will don't understand there's not too many the prophet says new verse you remember that quote not too many new verse why because people don't know what it is they think it's shouty speaking in tongues crying that's what they think it is that's not the new birth that's attributes you remember we ended up this morning talking about it a little listen what he goes on to say and as an eagle stirs his nest number two foreign he goes on and says it seems strange and said yes sir what makes these people act like that is because they're born from above they're spirits of another kingdom their kingdom is above Jesus said if this world was my kingdom my people would fight for it but my kingdom is up above read you Matthew Mark Luke and John simply read the Bible for yourself and watch what it talks about the kingdom and the different things you know and see what it's doing but do you see what he's saying look what he goes on to say in the Kinsmen Redeemer number three priests in 60. we're living in America while they're rolling out that's true that's the body part but to Soul that conducts us our character is from above we live from above because we're born from above all Christians come from above Jesus said I'm not from Below I'm from above if I was from below my subjects would fight for me but my kingdom is of above and so is every man that's born of the kingdom of God he's from above to the children to the young people I know we we use a lot of wordings and make great things and maybe sometimes we leave you not knowing what we're talking about but brother Dale believes firmly in and I believe the prophet did that you must be born again and then you say well well I believe the message I didn't say that he said well I cried I didn't say that he said I come to church every service I didn't say that because we're going to read in a minute you can impersonate every one of them but children you must be born again right and see that means dying out to yourself and accepting Jesus Christ as your savior but if you don't realize you're lost I've been out in the woods I don't got lost one time turned around a little bit maybe a few times but when you're lost you don't know which way you're going and trust me you'll go the wrong way the old Indian death walk you'll generally get in a circle and start circling unless you're smart enough to not do that on the basis of finding you a creek a thing and even your profit was turned around one time and kept circling and coming back because he didn't find any landmarks that he could follow had he followed in and found a creek or something he was making a circle and he just going around and around all right the but we've got to First realize that we're lost all right now Mom and Daddy loves you and you know they do all they can to help you and you know whatever thing and they want you to live right and do good but they're not your God they're not your savior they're not you're doing sure they help you and do all they can but kids you must be born again and you say well what does that mean I've been in the message all of my life I was born in this message well that's good but have you really accepted Jesus Christ as your savior well I didn't know I needed now you do okay I got it now so now you do no matter whether it's kids or adults now you know you know that you need to accept Jesus Christ as your savior we will get into more of these as we progress further in the thought of trying to help understand what it really means to be born again and what transpires within your life during those things but just remember number one you're lost why must you be born again because you're lost well brother Dale told me told me that I've lost well honey he just don't know what you're talking about you was born in the message and your mom and daddy was in the message now that don't run with me now it may run with your mom and daddy but it don't run with me all right my kids my grandkids my great grandkids my wife ever they've got to have their own experience with Jesus Christ not because I'm Papa the pastor that doesn't save nobody it's when you have the experience in your heart and life of Jesus Christ and that way then I want you to know that we have to be born from above all right watch what he goes on to say this is taken from the message the mark of the beast 1961. you talk about the kingdom and the citizens and all of it the kingdom of God is within you see they've argued even in organized religion I remember that one brother dick I know we used to talk about they argued about the point where it says Jesus said the kingdom is within some said it was just right there and some said it was in him and some said it was in US and all kind of what does it mean he simply meant what he said the kingdom was Within because once you receive the new birth it's not without it's within right so it matters is within the kingdom of God is the Holy Ghost you belong to that Kingdom that's the reason women don't bother her don't worry were shorts that's the reason men don't smoke cigarettes and things like that they're from above their Spirit teaches them righteousness Holiness they don't they don't swear they they don't don't use bad language and think why they're born from above they're different they're from citizens from above what kind of a reaction or thought what you have of the way the life that Jesus Christ would live what if he were here today I mean 2015. how would he live he wouldn't walk down the streets with a dick and big old robe he wouldn't act like that he would act and look in the similarity to what we are I said similarity because he wouldn't follow her after the wrong things but he would still be in that form or similarity or to what we are and that's always been the thing that helps me to understand anything about Christianity my whole question in my life has always been one thing what would Jesus do then they came up with this thing they were on their arms you know the kids you know the bands the WW J D is that the way it's going on there what would Jesus do you know well I had a man really rebuking me heavily one time about it didn't matter what she'd done or didn't do he said Jesus had long hair and said you say we're not supposed to have it as men so you know what I do and I just told him I said I'm not going to compromise with you I'm going to just make a statement if you lived like the Lord Jesus your hurricane drag the ground that's as simple as I could have make it it stopped the whole conversation I said you know you don't live like he did so there's no need of discussing whether it's long hire because see I would even agree that it was shoulder length higher because we'd have the words of the Prophet they wouldn't care about that but you know I don't have no problem with Jesus with shoulder length heart you know I don't have no problem with me and hire a little fool but now when it gets to running down and curling up and go down the back then and then you got to ponytail it up then you know you're getting a little bit on that and I'm sorry I'm too old I still think about the Tinker Bell ninety percent of you don't even know what that means we didn't call them bad names in our day we call them feminist Tinker Bells you know all right and get you in trouble like I said to the man I said if you live like Jesus and act like Jesus you can just the Earth just leave your hair alone you know yeah but it it just won't work but see you're born from above he said I'm glad our kingdom is above and if our kingdom is above we're born from above then we seek those things which are above where Christ sits at the right hand of God that's 252. God being misunderstood it goes on on God identifying himself by his characteristics he said this is the best Nation in the world but yet we're not Americans I said we are born from above the Holy Spirit come down and we belong to a kingdom it's not of this world that's the reason our sisters don't do the things of the world all right look what he goes on is getting my point in the thought look at number nine which is taken from the message called a paradox 63. that virgin birth was a mystery to the people they couldn't understand it just like the new birth is today the new birth is a mystery to the people they can't understand it they don't know what you mean they have belittled it bring it down saying well just because you believe something the Devils believes the same thing and Trembley it isn't what you believe is what God has actually done the new birth is a birth it was a new it was a paradox when God brought new life to the human race to reject it is eternal separation to receive it is eternal life a mystery now according to the definitions of Webster and bringing it down through the prophet's message a mystery is something that has not been made known it's been sealed away from you and it's a mystery and no matter how much you know about the doings it's still a mystery you know the atom bomb you can hold it in your hand but what do you think about comparing that to the fact of where they started with electric lights you know in the first what would it what was his name the the guy that made the first one you know done a man's house and he showed how to do it and he turned it on and made electric lights throughout the house do you realize the atom bomb is just a that if that had never been perfected in the electrical light situation the atom bomb would have never existed because it's simply uh further advancement of electricity but it had to go through many processes to be able to come to that all right we look back in the days of Martin Luther especially to come down into the ages and we see him in what he taught and that was the new birth of that time the just shall live by faith John Wesley comes along and believes the things Martin Luther had taught and he's converted under that you know the story but yet he realizes that there has a desire seemingly to him and he leaves there Londoner where it was comes to America to convert the heathen he runs into a group of people called a moraviander more rather how you pronounce it and they're actually taught him the way of sanctification but you know in all they could teach him they were not the messenger of the age and could not do what John Wesley done John Wesley took Luther's message and stood on it and then he seemed that there was more to the new birth and he stepped out on sanctification and you know what the new birth was of the days of John Wesley sanctification but it was still what more of the what he started with in one day the baptism when the Holy Ghost came on the Zeus then the message came the things and we're still what if Peter call it being born again further divising things and you look back there and once you can see it you look back then to the Old Testament and you can see what those men were actually speaking of and that's why that I read that when I go to her he said Jesus said if you'd have known Moses you'd have known me because that he spoke of me we don't know where he spoke you well you didn't read the Bible oh yeah they studied it every day they could tell you every word that was in it but they didn't get the thought that was in the Bible the thought that was in the Bible was speaking of the coming Messiah to die to give his life the word mankind could be born again and that someone would have to come to do that and it would not be just another human being it wouldn't be just an anointing you know that some of the Jews you know there's so much split within the Jewish ranks of doing that some of the Jews believed just a few years ago he was about 90 years old up here like New York or somewhere and they believed that was the Messiah because they were only looking for an anointing they were not looking for a person to come and to be born as it had to be born they just picked this man out because he probably had signs following him you know but follow my point for a second you must be born again there's a mystery but yet we've got to to the point that what we do is like he goes on to thirsting for life and he said the reason men go and join churches and put their names on them is because they're trying to bypass the new birth and watch it they don't want the new birth and some of the theologians today figure out what they called the new birth shake hands put your name on a paper you believe a declaration of creeds but the new birth is to be die and be born again a new a new creature in Christ see they can't understand now watch what he said though he says they bypass they don't want the new birth what about a people teaching you a way to heaven you don't you don't think this way I know I'm the only one to build in this wacko crazy to think the way I do but I'm sorry you got a church that they've spent all of their life sending their preachers to seminaries to teach you a set of rules or creeds and the prophet says they bypass the new birth he said they don't want it foreign you want to go right over here I'm not throwing those stones you want to go right over here and tell that brother he don't want a new birth you're going to be told off right because he's going to tell you I spent all my life all my life I've spent to try to bring the new birth to my people you said but you went by the traditions why didn't you go from the honestness of your heart to try to see the things in the word why do you want to bypass the real New Birth and to take something and call it the new birth I'm not talking about over there I'm talking about over here you remember me I Don't Preach over there that internet is going out I'm not the pastor the internet of the world I refuse to answer any questions even from ministers that are brought in I mean I've tried to answer give me an answer questions because I'm not going to pasture or anything like that I'm talking to Lula Georgia to you and me that some of you maybe claim the new birth from a wavelander longer than even my thoughts of it but is it genuine you get your feeling to hurt at me because I say so you know I mean you get upset at me because I say something to you hey you ordered let's be able to quote but if I said got to let somebody say something see how you react that's number one but what if you say something mean it you know I mean sister Anna what if I walked up to you and said to Anna I want you to know you're lost don't tell me I'm lost I'll drop him Jaws that's going to prove you something was right when but you understand my point my point is if we're born from above you know that won't bother us at all you know that I used to work with these brothers that are sitting right here one two three three I know for sure sitting here now I used to work with I think it was seven of us at one time and we Fellowship together every day eight together talked together worked side by side a lot of days you know what they call me a queer that I was a homosexual because all I'd done was hung around men well you know that didn't offend me I didn't get mad at nobody it didn't upset me for them to think that you know what I think if I hadn't have been born again I'd probably think the same thing you don't ever do that you don't ever think things over and wonder what side of the fence you would be on had God not brought you to where you are thank you in the end it brought us to the position to where we'd have an understanding we would be falling for the traditions and the ways of mankind thank God for the truth but the new birth is a mystery shouting he said speaking in tongues I gave it this morning he said those are just attributes that follow the life yet we call it the new birth he said are you born again I spoke in tongues I shot it I cried I believe the word I walk with the prophet I slept with him I hunted with him I believe everything said you ever seen people that tell you are right balance to your face I believe everything the prophet says well the Bible and the prophet both says forsake not descending of yourself together as the manner of some is and yet people believe everything the prophet said but don't go to church right see this right but look we put everything on shouting speaking in tongues running crying praying whatever according to questions and answers 1954 he said that's just attributes that follow he said the first thing is to accept the person Christ Jesus all right look what he says on this one and I enjoy it because you will see one of these days the Lord willing looks the last one we use it I will restore and you'll see why brother Branham a lot of times had to say what he said I've studied this message for 50 years and to see the perfection or the lineup the man had did in 54 unless side by side was 65. 47 -65. and see that he really knew what he was talking about and you know yourself that I in the ministry style that I've been that I spent the biggest portion of my Ministry taking things that looked like and he said this and he said this that we're contrary to one to the other to the Daniel 70 weeks to the godhead New Birth the predestinations the marriage and divorce that I've spent that time declaring that he knew what he was talking about now I don't believe he knew what he's talking about all the time I said that I never did say that but it's so amazing sometimes I wonder did he even know what he said until a later date would come and he'd see why see the people of this message reject all organized religion all forms or Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostals but how can you build a church and reject the truth of Martin Luther the truth of Martin Luther not when he was teaching that the Jews ought to be took out and be killed that was just a human being that was under the age of his doing that he'd smoke a pipe and drank a beer and talk about the Lord but yet he had to message you that day and for you to be in the body of that day you was going to believe that message think about it well then do you reject the Lutheran message no I reject the denominational teachings of what the man taught that way brother run said we don't have nothing against organize religion he said it's the doctrine systems why can't we be friends and neighbors with people of other religions I want to get their Spirit don't you worry about it honey you ain't gonna get it you don't got it well that's the reason you're saying that because you're scared to death are you afraid to face someone with your Doctrine let's read what your Prophet had to say for my will restore Worship the Lord a man come to me here on the West Coast a few weeks ago he said brother Branham I went I've been trying to seek the Lord for the last five years he said I went to Mr Graham's meeting meeting he told me to hold up my hand except Jesus said I did I went out with the same thing I went to a free Methodist Church they told me I had to get happy enough to shout and I did and said I still went away unsatisfied I said I went to another man's meeting now you all know him brother Roberts exactly my buddy my friend said brother Robert says stay in there until you speak with tongues then you got it so he said I went there and prayed until I did speak with tongues and still I haven't got it and watch it I said my brother what Billy Graham told you is the truth you know just believe he said that's the truth what the Free Methodist told you is the truth sounds good believe it's good when Oral Roberts told you is the truth seeing her long enough right around and said quote it he said if you stay under the spout long enough you'll come through speaking in tongues that's the prophet's word but look what he said what Oral Roberts told you is the truth I don't believe me he's he's explaining what they said and each one of them was part of the truth believing is part of the truth or to be all the truth but I mean I'm getting the point shouting crying is part of the truth we believe in it speaking in tongues is part of the truth we believe in it right but receiving Christ is not whether you shout whether you hold up your hand it's receiving the person Christ Jesus in your heart and these things are attributes that follow it attributes that follow it the shout the speaking in tongue the things you do is attributes like smoking drinking gambling is not sin it's an attribute right see we make the birth the attribute come on you've heard the prophets say I've seen a lot of people shouting in that you've seen people thinking tongues didn't happen he said sin ending speak in tongues and write in unknown tongues and tell the truth but see none of that is to be born from above none of that is the new birth all of that is attributes for you to do after you receive Jesus Christ well you're taking away everything I ever believed okay if I can take away what you believe you didn't ever believe it it was never a revelation that's right it went to Revelation we'll get to that that the new birth is a revelation we'll get to those things but the main point of understanding is what you got to be born from above the new birth is not crying speaking in drunk shouting believing all of those are wonderful and part of the Christian Life but they are not the new birth two to the world around him explaining the new birth I'm going to have to say it when I get there to it anyway but to most people in this message they cannot even tell you what brother Branham says a new birth is because they don't study that that was a piece that was we're into these great Revelations of these seals and Thunders and trumpets and vowels you remember like I said the other day when the brother said we go out Beyond brother Branham I said okay he preached us to the Future home so now tell me after the future home don't talk about me some of these other little play things you're going to talk about tell me out Mr he couldn't do that but what does it mean to you that you're born from above is this a fictitational story with a superhero of Superman or Saint Nick or some character or is this the Bible speaking of the very God of Glory see the only way you could be born from above would be for your life to come from above right so if you're gonna have a Superman you know coming from another planet then you're gonna have to remember that we've got to come from dark too right no brother Dale we don't believe that but you believe more in that than you believe the real truth you'd rather believe something fictition or something and Satan has had a lot of them and they're called preachers because that's what the Bible says that is angels are as Ministers of righteousness when you see a law teacher just remember he ain't even in the class now if you want to argue with about the art with the Bible it says his Ministers of Satan were as Ministers of righteousness they'll bring you enough for the right to deceive you with it they're not even to the point of saying you got to do this and you got to do that but then what about the biggest portion of this message people that says you got to do this you got to do that I know they're born again because of the way they live that's good good but you live all of that good life and impersonate it and still be lost well you don't believe in living good no just go ahead and run your run your thoughts about what I'd say I don't believe in living good I believe in being born again I got the quote laying in here first laying on the desk where that's what the prophet is saying it's not the fact that you're trying to live good it's a fact of whether you're born again or not he said if you're born again the life will take care of itself wouldn't that be something I have to get up every morning now Peggy don't you know now you're Christian true you don't cut your hair today and you got to wear dresses and at night when you get ready to go to bed God I thank you that my wife survived being a Christian today come on this is what the prophet said this morning when the man said what must we do to be born again he said we tell them what not to do did he didn't ask that he won't know how to get born again well you just come to church and you believe and just do the best you can one of these days Lord take care of it yeah born from above now make this life statement now according to our understanding we're not talking about a Superman situation even though isn't it odd that Superman came to Earth as a baby that was an odd one but we think about a supernatural person right and did he come from a supernatural world to live in US to make us Supernatural and that is the new birth well if there was a planet of Krypton or anything you'd want to call it and Jesus come from there then we ought to wanna live and look like that true shouldn't we not want to be like him what about it I thought that this thing was going to wind up on Earth I thought it would wind up in and we would have a millennial reign here on Earth and then we would go and have a future home here on Earth that it was not going to another planet or a situation but that God of Glory would come here and live with us and this would be the center of the universe because everywhere God is would be the center of all things what about it but it is true that he came a baby and you know what it is true that if we're born into this Kingdom the Bible says we must become as a little child right now you explain that one I'm 75. I'm Nicodemus now you mean I got to go back to my mama yeah you just said it no the day I got born again I had to become a child to receive that within my heart because a child is the only one that can understand that a child can understand each other and fight and bicker and argue and fuss the next minute hugging in life and then going on and they're not even born again at a lot of places but yet they're acting like another civilization so we must become as a child die out to all of our thinking and accept Jesus Christ and become a baby in Christ to desire the sincere milk of the word that we may grow thereby that we're actually born from above we're not of this world we have to live here we make a living we have to do things but we're not of this world we sing that song This world's not my home it's true it's not come on brothers this world's not our home we're just here for a while all right we didn't come from that other world in any physical form we must be transmitted into the kingdom that was within him to be like him while we're here then we found out to go to heaven doesn't mean that we go flying to the sky in that it starts off by being resurrected sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and then it will eventually finish up by God and everything coming here Joe is not a Superman story is God's Bible to unfold in a Simplicity of you and I as being Christians you know what we have a right to look at people and I say enough talk to you we don't need to because it don't work no good but we do have a right to look at people if I act like some other country you can say I must be from that other country right and if I act like the world you can say that I must be the world but if we act like Christ then maybe something has started in our hearts and lives to make us Worthy born from above not from Below a kingdom read Matthew Mark Luke and John and notice everything that's spoken of the Kingdom every other Parable is a kingdom the kingdom kingdom kingdom of heaven is like a deer the kingdom you know what we get into in the in the para in The Parables on the kingdom one of them talks about the kingdom of God the other talks about the kingdom of heaven I've heard people argue over that one of them was one thing and the other one was another thing I said I always thought it's just a new birth put us in the Kingdom yeah but you got the kingdom of God is to do this the Kingdom of Heaven is to do that I didn't know you had to divide it up I thought he was the god of Heaven right well yeah we can take all of that and argue doctor we can argue argue uh attributes my attribute fits the word I know where the Prophet said that it's whether or not the spirit in you agrees with the word amen in my spirit of Grace with the word I doubt that you need somebody to jog you just a little bit to see what you do believe you need somebody to ring your jaws physically to see whether you're not whether or not you got the spirit of Christ to be able to turn the other cheek you'll not be another way well why not is it the truth should we be that way should we pray for our enemies and them that despite flee uses the word I pray for my friends but it's hard to pray for my enemies right Susan we get a kick out of her in Bible study she's always asking a question for some friend I got a friend that's got a question we know the friend that's got a question she raised a hand but that way we can all be Christian let's stand together what do we got brother what we got E flat let's just sing a song Anybody ever need now remember we're going downstairs and eat some cake and ice cream sweet let's say are you born from above We Believe already his grace to the people we've seen great things happen from just prayer claws right we lay our hands upon this prayer Clause this piece of material to be made into little pieces given to people as a prayer call and we've had it here laying on the platform for a long time we wore it today within our body as we preach the gospel and now we gather together as men of the gospel and ask you to just come down and put your anointing upon these Claws and as we give them to people that it will take care of the needs in the bodies and we thank you father in Jesus name amen praise God yes in Jesus Christ Lord Jesus thank you
