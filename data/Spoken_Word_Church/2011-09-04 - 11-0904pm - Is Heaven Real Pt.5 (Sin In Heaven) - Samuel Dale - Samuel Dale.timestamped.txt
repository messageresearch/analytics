[19:30] us if you'd like turn in your scriptures
[19:31] turn to Revelations
[19:33] 12 now I got to do two parts this
[19:36] afternoon so I'm going to drop back a
[19:39] little bit for the morning and carry
[19:41] over because I'm sure that I will not
[19:43] complete the uh what I want to bring out
[19:47] on Revelations 12 but we will go as far
[19:50] as we can and just get as much and then
[19:51] we'll we'll try to uh uh bring maybe the
[19:55] rest of it Wednesday but we'll be
[19:57] dropping back to just to Heart okay so
[19:59] just remember that remember pray one for
[20:01] another the Lord would bless father we
[20:04] thank you we love you and
[20:07] truly you are the rock of our Salvation
[20:10] that's right truly you hide our
[20:12] soul thank you Jesus in The Cliff of
[20:15] your
[20:17] rocken when all is over and all is
[20:19] finished then we will be able to realize
[20:23] realization and realize that this Earth
[20:25] was a wonderful place to be and a
[20:27] wonderful time because
[20:28] here is where we start our
[20:31] journey here's where we will end our
[20:34] journey and all will be made well and
[20:37] father then we go to meet you in the air
[20:40] we love you and we thank you and just be
[20:42] with each one be with the sick among us
[20:44] cuz you said it you said I sent my word
[20:47] and healed them yes thank you Lord and
[20:50] delivered from destruction we love you
[20:52] and we thank you in Jesus name amen now
[20:57] I I said it's going to be hard to cover
[20:59] because I'm going to have to just break
[21:01] down Revelations 12 and uh don't worry
[21:04] about it we can come back later and
[21:07] eventually pull it over in after the
[21:09] Rapture and you'll see that it will tie
[21:11] into to Israel and their Journey etc etc
[21:15] but we're not concerned with that part
[21:18] we're just wanting to get what is to be
[21:21] known known for this day and the hour so
[21:23] Revelations
[21:25] 12:1 and there appeared a great Wonder
[21:28] in heaven a woman clothed with the sun
[21:30] and the moon under her feet and upon her
[21:33] head a crown of 12 stars and she being
[21:36] with child cried she being with child
[21:39] cried travailing in birth and pain to be
[21:42] delivered and there appeared another
[21:44] Wonder in heaven and behold a great red
[21:47] dragon having seven horns and SE and
[21:50] having seven horns and 10 crowns and
[21:53] seven crowns upon his
[21:55] heads and his tail drew the Third part
[21:58] of the stars of heaven and did cast them
[22:01] to the earth and the dragon stood before
[22:03] the woman which was ready to be
[22:05] delivered for it to devour her child as
[22:07] soon as it was
[22:09] born and she brought forth a Manchild
[22:12] who was to rule all nations with a rod
[22:13] of iron and her child was caught up unto
[22:15] God and to his throne and the woman fled
[22:18] Into the Wilderness where she had the
[22:20] place prepared of God that they should
[22:23] feed her for 1,23 score days now here's
[22:27] the point what we want to get to because
[22:29] that shows something back here then
[22:31] we're coming down and there was war in
[22:33] heaven Michael and his angels fought
[22:36] against the dragon and the dragon fought
[22:38] in his angels and Prevail not neither
[22:41] was there a place found anymore in
[22:43] neither was their place found anymore in
[22:48] heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out
[22:52] that old serpent called the devil and
[22:55] Satan which deceiveth the whole world
[22:58] and he was cast out into the Earth and
[22:59] his angels were cast out with him then
[23:03] there something glorious will happen
[23:04] that we probably won't get this far but
[23:07] and I heard a loud voice saying in
[23:09] heaven now is come salvation and
[23:12] strength and the kingdom of our God and
[23:14] the power of His Christ for the accuser
[23:17] of our Brethren is cast down which
[23:19] accused them before our God day and
[23:22] night you may be seated the Lord add his
[23:25] Blessing to the reading of the word
[23:32] now we ended up this
[23:35] morning talking
[23:38] about you know that how real God
[23:44] is and how real heaven
[23:47] is because I believe that God is
[23:51] a you
[23:53] know he's a greater higher beyond
[23:57] anything that we we could comprehend
[23:59] right
[24:00] right but yet he's a
[24:03] being right and then I believe heaven is
[24:07] real because that was where he was at
[24:09] yes he existed in heaven now we're not
[24:12] concerned with where it comes down to
[24:15] different things later and Heaven and
[24:17] Earth will pass away you know and this
[24:18] out of the other I'm just kind of like
[24:20] the old brother that said you know I'm
[24:24] glad that it says in the word abide it
[24:26] forever cuz if Heaven and Earth away
[24:28] than the world of God so we don't have
[24:29] to worry about it but we know that it's
[24:32] not
[24:34] Annihilation it is changing from one
[24:36] form to another right just as you
[24:40] receiving the new birth that was not the
[24:44] annihilation of your
[24:46] soul that was just changing the form
[24:49] that it was in which was sin and
[24:52] changing it into eternal life by the
[24:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost ghost so it's
[24:59] not an
[25:00] Annihilation the only thing that I know
[25:02] of that will ever be annihilated is the
[25:05] devil and his angels in hell that's
[25:08] right and you show me anything else that
[25:10] will be annihilated I'd like to see it
[25:15] see once you destroy that then you don't
[25:17] have to worry about anything everything
[25:19] will be done and you know and God will
[25:22] be in command all but now
[25:28] I'm trying to put the point across this
[25:30] morning strongly to you that God is
[25:33] real we say that he's a
[25:36] spirit but in comparison to where the
[25:39] dimensions we are here to get to a
[25:43] Heavenly place as we would call
[25:46] it and then we in this part of the earth
[25:50] the word Spirit just means no
[25:54] form it's just you don't put a form to a
[25:58] spirit you know it's just floating
[26:01] around well that's our definition
[26:03] here but in the place we would call
[26:07] heaven and he being who he is and and
[26:11] all and being a spirit what would that
[26:14] word mean
[26:16] there you cuz Even in our natural
[26:20] languages you say something in a natural
[26:23] language here and you say it in English
[26:26] you better be careful how that you uh
[26:28] translate that
[26:30] into uh some other language I told you
[26:32] about when I was in Brazil when I was
[26:35] trying to make an emphasis about you
[26:37] know that God made a help meet you know
[26:40] it doesn't say help me in Genesis it's
[26:42] help meet
[26:44] in and I was trying to emphasize that
[26:47] about sister Cesar and they all when it
[26:49] was translated I mean they just was
[26:51] having them a hilarious time life and
[26:54] and I knew something was wrong and I
[26:56] looked over in my I said to The
[26:58] Interpreter I said something went wrong
[27:02] well we've got to get together and what
[27:03] did you say he said well I translated
[27:06] what you
[27:07] said I said yeah but it didn't come out
[27:10] right cuz something's messed up you know
[27:13] and me and him standing talking like
[27:15] this they're still just dying laughing I
[27:17] said tell me what you said about her he
[27:20] said well I told her she would have help
[27:21] meet you know she was meat me a I said
[27:26] that's not what the the Bible says and
[27:29] that wasn't what I
[27:30] said I said don't call her that call her
[27:33] a help meet me he never seen in the
[27:36] Bible and he actually read it see right
[27:38] there and because he was reading what I
[27:40] was to saying so he got it back I said
[27:43] get it together let's see what does it
[27:44] mean he said oh you me you I said well
[27:49] now tell her what I mean she's wonderful
[27:52] she's part of him she's this because
[27:54] when you use the word me t it means part
[27:58] of you see a woman become and man
[28:00] becomes one what if you're just to have
[28:02] mate two men can be a mate come on we're
[28:06] in the wrong days right two women can be
[28:08] a mate right it doesn't have anything it
[28:12] doesn't get it in the right order so God
[28:13] didn't say that so get what I'm saying
[28:16] in the language we're using we try to
[28:19] express what we see but in comparison to
[28:22] what it would be in the Heavenly
[28:23] language when all of us around the world
[28:26] would be able to one way to just
[28:29] understand exactly what somebody says
[28:31] and what it's meant see so it's so much
[28:34] above we'll read to it when we get it
[28:36] it's so much above this this is not even
[28:38] in the picture all right but now we were
[28:40] talking
[28:41] about
[28:44] that the first Creation in
[28:47] heaven the prophet of God said and I
[28:49] gave it to you this morning
[28:51] that God was his first
[28:54] creation all right and in doing that
[28:58] him being the first
[29:00] creation now it's like a sister
[29:03] mentioned
[29:04] outside you
[29:06] know I won't say what she said
[29:09] but see you can get confusing because
[29:12] when you say the beginning of the
[29:14] creation of
[29:16] God all right now here's our click
[29:21] computer brother said anything had a
[29:23] beginning had an
[29:25] ending see now we just killed the whole
[29:27] thought yeah amen because brother Ram
[29:31] was saying God was his first
[29:35] creation but his first creation was
[29:38] himself moving over into understanding
[29:43] or to Bringing himself to a basis toward
[29:45] us that we could comprehend him not that
[29:47] he had a beginning right see we just use
[29:50] that word beginning so loosely till we
[29:52] say anything has a beginning has an
[29:53] ending to it right well then you'd say
[29:56] Jesus was the beginning of the creation
[29:58] of God well then well he's another
[30:00] person then no he's God made manifest
[30:04] right he's a being he's
[30:07] real all right so that's what I wanted
[30:09] to make sure you understand and I know
[30:11] most of you here have been with me long
[30:13] enough and I've read these many times
[30:14] but still we're going out now to the
[30:16] basis that some people begin to wonder
[30:18] maybe somebody heard that you know and
[30:20] they say let's see brother R said God
[30:23] was his first creation that's a creation
[30:26] is bringing something something from
[30:28] from I read you the definition of it
[30:31] that it can come from even a thought
[30:33] into
[30:34] manifestation and be called a
[30:36] creation see so get don't be so quick to
[30:40] snatch the words and just hang on to
[30:43] that just loosen up and let it let it
[30:45] under give understanding to what we're
[30:47] doing so I wanted to read a couple of
[30:49] about three quotes from the morning's
[30:51] message that I didn't get to and then
[30:53] we'll start in the evening okay so bear
[30:56] with me so if they'll pull up brother
[30:58] Joe uh it wasn't so from the beginning
[31:01] 1960 306 E10 right so let's just see
[31:05] what brother randam has to say about
[31:07] this great
[31:09] person that we're talking
[31:12] about this great almighty
[31:14] God when his whole
[31:18] desire from the very beginning is always
[31:21] been to reveal himself am to his
[31:26] creation yes
[31:27] to show himself to his
[31:30] family you know to bring into being
[31:33] himself to where that we can comprehend
[31:36] him but listen what your Prophet has to
[31:39] say now God is omnipotent omnipresent by
[31:42] being omnicient he knows to be there so
[31:45] he can makes him
[31:48] omnipresent he he knows all things but
[31:51] God could not be just like the IR
[31:55] is now listen to your problem Prophet
[31:58] because God has a Dwelling
[32:00] Place God is not a myth God is a being
[32:04] God Jesus he God pronoun he is a being
[32:10] therefore he's omnicient omnipresent
[32:12] omnipotent infinite
[32:15] now see then we say that he's just a
[32:20] spirit and see mankind believes he's
[32:23] just like the wind the amoya in Africa
[32:27] and see but watch brother BR said then
[32:29] if it is you breathe in and out see I
[32:33] breathe out brother collie breathes in
[32:35] that would be a mo you're going between
[32:36] me and him because it's just like breath
[32:40] amen but it's not that
[32:42] way God is a
[32:45] being he's
[32:47] real all right now what's going down
[32:50] he's not a myth that's right go he said
[32:54] he has a Dwelling Place amen
[32:59] where does God dwell in
[33:02] heaven what's the problem with
[33:06] that all right look on down to the next
[33:08] one adoption U part 3 62 I mean 6522 the
[33:13] morning service paragraph
[33:16] 51 he comes down talking about this
[33:19] spars and he says he's omnicient he
[33:21] knows everything but he is a being God
[33:25] is a being and out of this being begin
[33:27] to bring forth things now brother Ram
[33:30] didn't have to break it down as I said
[33:32] when this morning trying to emphasize it
[33:34] when we say God oh God's an object of
[33:37] worship now brother brandom never said
[33:39] God is an object of
[33:42] worship in every time he used the word
[33:46] God when he was Des describing what God
[33:49] is yes but he had no trouble saying
[33:55] God he didn't mean that object of
[33:57] worship he could be talking about the
[33:58] very God of creation all of the whole
[34:00] thing he can be talking about the very
[34:02] Elohim the self-existing
[34:06] all right because he's real look what
[34:10] the next one answer to say is what I
[34:11] like cuz you'd be like theoa see the are
[34:13] going in and out if you wouldn't careful
[34:15] this is from the message Fellowship
[34:18] e19 uh 1966
[34:20] 111b he talking about God being is a
[34:24] being now God's just not like you're
[34:27] like the a if he
[34:30] would you would never have to seek the
[34:33] Holy Ghost it would be in you cuz he'd F
[34:38] all space and things God God I'm the
[34:42] present sure by being omniscient
[34:45] omnicient means he knows everything is I
[34:47] no problem knowing all things but God
[34:49] has a dwelling
[34:50] place because he is a being exactly
[34:54] right and God dwells with Fellowship
[34:57] under the shed blood of his son and that
[34:59] alone amen not Upon Our denomination or
[35:03] affiliation upon the shed blood we meet
[35:05] God face to face he's a
[35:09] being now we'll read another one when it
[35:11] come out to one on the Eden
[35:13] CH see he's not like the wind that's
[35:17] right right well I've seen him in the
[35:20] Whirlwind
[35:21] amen but you know what brother R said
[35:23] about that he said the Whirlwind
[35:25] wouldn't God that's right
[35:28] he said it's what he's veiled in that's
[35:31] right but see we we think about it we
[35:33] think we've heard so much all right
[35:36] number next one if you will which is
[35:40] things that are to be 1965 1205
[35:44] paragraph 42 all right look what he says
[35:47] he said Heaven is a real
[35:50] place he said it's not like my mother
[35:52] used to tell
[35:55] me you know that we get up there and we
[35:58] it is and we' be doing that see in a
[36:01] place called Heaven and the musicians
[36:04] would be able to play well I can't play
[36:06] here I figure I won't be able to
[36:09] there I'm not concerned about it I'm
[36:13] just concerned with getting there you
[36:14] know all but he said after the opening
[36:17] of The Seven Seals now I emphasized this
[36:20] the other day purposely for the point
[36:22] when brother random went beyond the
[36:23] curtain of time you don't hear him here
[36:26] referring to
[36:28] to the point he's getting
[36:33] at beyond the curtain of time was real
[36:35] to
[36:36] him
[36:38] right but here he's talking about the
[36:42] word the word is more real than anything
[36:44] else that's right Satan can impersonate
[36:47] those things that's right show you
[36:50] Visions
[36:51] dreams
[36:53] whatever but he can't impersonate the
[36:56] word so he said because the opening the
[36:58] seals now we understand I believe that
[37:01] heaven is a real place just the same as
[37:04] this a real is a real place see for God
[37:07] started us in our spiritual growth in
[37:09] this place right here and I believe that
[37:11] heaven is a place just as real as this
[37:14] where we don't set up there for eternity
[37:16] and just sit there on a cloud we don't
[37:19] just strum our harp for all all from
[37:23] here
[37:25] ever but we're going to a real place
[37:29] where we're going to do things where
[37:31] we're going to live we're going to work
[37:33] we're going to enjoy we're going to live
[37:35] we're going to life to a real eternal
[37:38] life we're going to heaven a
[37:43] paradise going to heaven a
[37:47] paradise heaven is real God is real
[37:50] that's the point I'm trying to get you
[37:51] to see the whole thing of me preaching
[37:55] this whole thing that we've been on this
[37:57] is message number five you been talking
[37:58] about is heaven real I've been asking
[38:00] you that question is your heaven
[38:02] real is your God
[38:07] real or is it just the mythologies or
[38:11] thoughts but I'm
[38:13] sincere you want to go with the prophet
[38:16] and talk about sincerity where that over
[38:18] in some of those countries they take
[38:20] their babies and they feed them to an
[38:24] alligator to try to appease that God you
[38:27] want to talk about
[38:30] sincerity see let's don't get into that
[38:33] let's just get down to reality of life
[38:35] and living and and doing and things and
[38:38] being who we are now back up then just
[38:40] to what we were talking about this
[38:41] morning what
[38:43] that the first creation was God
[38:47] himself and then from that he created
[38:50] the Loos the word the theophany the Son
[38:52] of God in other words he set from one
[38:55] form which would be totally to where you
[38:58] don't even have any comprehension of
[39:01] whatsoever he begins to what would be a
[39:04] better way you tell me the words I'll
[39:05] use them but he began as the prophet
[39:08] said to change his
[39:10] form so we can get some
[39:14] idea about this
[39:17] God so he moves over into the word
[39:21] form and he begins to be in that word
[39:24] form No Angel no molecules no Earth no
[39:28] doings nothing
[39:30] here in heaven so he creates
[39:35] angels and they worship him and that
[39:39] makes him as our English word god an
[39:42] object of worship and those angels are
[39:45] worshiping Angels that's where Satan the
[39:47] the kingdom of the north go study it get
[39:49] into the to the doings and even get back
[39:51] into the to the Old Testament and watch
[39:53] the the layout of the children of Israel
[39:56] and and the 12 tribes and the things how
[39:58] they would count and they count like
[40:00] three three three and three you know or
[40:02] whatever uh you
[40:05] know and it's got to move out a certain
[40:07] way they got to go this man can't go
[40:09] before this man it's all got to do this
[40:11] then you got to worship altar see Satan
[40:14] is a worship he loves beautiful
[40:18] music he's worship
[40:20] Angel he was in charge of all of the the
[40:24] worship in
[40:25] heaven now I like what brother George
[40:28] Canada said years ago one time he's
[40:32] talking he said when those angels said
[40:34] they look at him and they see him and
[40:35] said they say Glory Glory
[40:38] Glory he said they look back and they
[40:40] see him again and they see more of him
[40:42] and they say glory glory glory and look
[40:44] back and see more of Him Glory Glory
[40:46] Glory so the more every time it's not
[40:48] just a well that be the dumb I mean the
[40:50] the dullest place to be to sit there
[40:52] listen somebody Glory Glory Glory Glory
[40:55] Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory
[40:57] Glory 24 hours a day 7 Days of a week
[41:00] for about 10,000
[41:02] years but it wouldn't be if every time
[41:04] you said Glory Glory Glory you saw him a
[41:07] little
[41:08] higher you saw a little more of him you
[41:11] saw him as he was beginning to unfold
[41:14] itself then you'd want them angels to
[41:16] sing Glory Glory Glory but but the first
[41:19] was created was
[41:20] Angels see that was before anything
[41:23] natural natural world atmospheres life
[41:27] stars moon etc for anything he created
[41:32] angels and they worshiped him for
[41:35] billions of trillions of me because
[41:37] there was no
[41:38] time and as I said this morning then we
[41:41] talk about angels is being something
[41:43] running around with
[41:44] wings who did we get that from there is
[41:48] illustrations
[41:50] yes but where did we get that all angels
[41:53] have wings and then where did we get
[41:55] Glory under put her in all of this stuff
[41:59] as a female angel there is no such thing
[42:01] as a female nor male Angel they're
[42:04] masculine in the look because God is
[42:07] masculine right but they are not
[42:09] masculine in the point they cannot have
[42:11] children they cannot
[42:14] procreate none of that is
[42:17] involved and they were made for a
[42:19] specific purpose to worship God right
[42:22] but they also had another meaning
[42:24] involved in it
[42:27] cuz the Bible said that there the angels
[42:29] are ministering
[42:33] Spirits sent to the children of the HS
[42:37] of
[42:40] Salvation they you that job back there
[42:43] you remember two or three services ago
[42:45] when the morning Stars sang together and
[42:47] the sons of God shouted for joy we saw
[42:49] those angels
[42:52] worshiping was we back there not this
[42:54] people no no no no know we were in him
[42:58] yes am in him we've been down through it
[43:03] but now
[43:04] listen heaven then is a real
[43:09] place just as say is we're in a real
[43:13] place that's what we just got through
[43:15] reading that was what I was ending up
[43:16] this morning it's number one coming back
[43:19] up
[43:20] on uh to where we're talking about so
[43:23] let's get down to who is this mches that
[43:26] was uh things that already be let's go
[43:29] to number one now and just get started
[43:31] on what we're talking about cuz I want
[43:33] to keep this in your
[43:35] mind to where we can see it and see how
[43:38] God is and how great he is then we can
[43:41] understand okay paragraph 48 who is this
[43:44] mzc 1965 through 21 to evening
[43:49] service now notice those who have have
[43:51] tonight eternal life was with him in him
[43:54] in his thinking before the was ever an
[43:57] angel star cherubim or anything else
[44:01] that's Eternal and if you have eternal
[44:03] life you always was not your being here
[44:06] but the shape and form of the infinite
[44:09] God Amen now break it right
[44:16] there when God stepped over into another
[44:19] form to be known as the Son of God the
[44:22] Loos the
[44:24] Creator he didn't wait to get there to
[44:27] create
[44:29] us that's what we just
[44:32] read before there was any of those
[44:35] things if you have eternal life right
[44:39] cuz now see if you don't understand how
[44:41] that he could be a
[44:47] creation he just stepped into another
[44:50] form that's right if we wasn't in heaven
[44:54] in God in the beginning as the eternal
[44:56] life that we have within us now you
[44:58] understand me the eternal life that we
[45:00] have within us not this thing you're
[45:02] looking at I just read he said not your
[45:04] being here no body Spirit Soul form so
[45:07] get all that out of the way
[45:12] right see then we never had a beginning
[45:16] right that's why your Prophet could say
[45:19] it right he said if you have eternal
[45:22] life you always was eternal amen
[45:26] hallelujah look what the people though
[45:27] take of the message I don't need to get
[45:30] the Holy Ghost I always was eternal now
[45:32] where did brother randam say
[45:34] that he said we begin our eternal life
[45:37] right here
[45:39] right well what do you mean he said was
[45:41] always Eternal he said the eternal life
[45:44] you have if you have eternal life was
[45:47] that what he said those who have eternal
[45:50] life does who have tonight eternal life
[45:54] was with him in him in his thinking
[45:56] whether we just in his thinking he would
[45:58] just he just thinking about
[46:01] us well that's
[46:03] wonderful that's as far as you can
[46:05] comprehend that's true but we've been
[46:07] quite a while studying on the thoughts
[46:10] of God right and the things and we found
[46:13] out the thoughts of God are Eternal
[46:15] that's right and that he can never have
[46:17] a new thought that's right right right
[46:21] right so then if he thought of you in
[46:23] the beginning you know watch you in the
[46:25] beginning with
[46:27] him but not as people that's what we
[46:30] want to do we want to get this person
[46:32] involved out here
[46:34] right then you look at it and you tell
[46:36] me I'm wrong somebody come and tell me
[46:38] I'm wrong about it every doctrine that
[46:40] has run with that that you always was
[46:42] eternal has wound up in the bed of
[46:44] adultery with young girls and all kind
[46:46] of things you want me to name
[46:49] names no it wouldn't do no good cuz it
[46:51] wouldn't change nobody right but you
[46:54] check your pastor and say
[46:58] check him out he starts preaching about
[47:00] everything oh I always was eternal I
[47:02] could just feel it I was oh just sweetly
[47:05] I just love it cuz I was always there
[47:07] with him I just feel it all over me yeah
[47:09] Napoleon did
[47:12] too lot people might not understand that
[47:15] symbolics but Napoleon claimed he was
[47:20] reincarnation but
[47:22] listen I'm not talking about junk I'm
[47:24] talking about something that's real
[47:25] that's right amen a real God
[47:29] Amen not your being here right but the
[47:33] form of the infinite God look what he
[47:35] goes on to
[47:40] say omnicient makes him omnipresent God
[47:43] is a being he's not like the
[47:46] wind I remember a certain brother in
[47:48] this message years
[47:49] ago he put out some books how we built a
[47:52] house wrong so you know who it was
[47:54] somebody he said well to me God is just
[47:57] like the wind he's just blowing
[48:00] everywhere just
[48:02] blowing and I asked brother calling
[48:04] looking at me grinning cuz he knows what
[48:06] went wrong and I asked this brother said
[48:09] well see her to him God is like the wind
[48:12] I said that was my brother Brown said he
[48:14] said well he just saying it's like to
[48:16] him I don't care what he said what
[48:18] brother Brown
[48:21] say brother R said he's not like the
[48:23] wind amen right
[48:26] right you know God don't have to be in
[48:28] heaven don't have to be on the moon
[48:30] right
[48:30] now unless there's somebody up
[48:35] there he's omniscient omnipresent what
[48:38] he's omnipresent in that he's omniscient
[48:41] he knows to be there if he needs to be
[48:44] there the first time they went to the
[48:45] moon they came back and told you that
[48:48] there were two or three objects followed
[48:50] him there and back he had to go as a
[48:53] witness all right but look what he say
[48:58] because he
[49:00] knows that he dwells he is a being not
[49:03] like the wind he he is a being he dwells
[49:06] in a
[49:07] house oh my God my God don't need a
[49:11] house
[49:13] am
[49:16] why why is it we've always tried to make
[49:19] him
[49:24] one did did he not come down when they
[49:27] got through making him a
[49:32] house come on see we think well we just
[49:35] quote words words don't mean anything
[49:37] there's no Revelation that's right look
[49:39] what he goes on to say things that are
[49:40] to
[49:44] be 1965 1205 paragraph 38 he's
[49:49] omnipresent because he's omnicient
[49:51] omnicient because he's omnipresent
[49:54] therefore by his for knowledge
[49:56] now he can't be just like the wind be
[50:00] can't be just like the wind over the
[50:02] Earth because he is a
[50:04] being he just isn't a mid he's a being
[50:08] he
[50:08] dwells he even dwells in a house he
[50:12] dwells in a place called
[50:16] heaven right God dwells in a place
[50:19] called
[50:21] Heaven well why can't we believe Heaven
[50:23] is
[50:24] real
[50:28] H why can't we believe that
[50:32] except cuz he said I gave you the one
[50:34] quote where he said we wouldn't have to
[50:36] pray for the Holy Ghost if he's just
[50:38] like the
[50:41] wind it just be going
[50:45] everywhere but he's a
[50:53] being I thought we believe that we were
[50:55] created in the image of
[50:58] God now brother Dale you sure get no no
[51:01] no no don't break it down too far to us
[51:02] cuz we're going to get all confused now
[51:04] you already are forget
[51:07] it he had some image or idea of a way to
[51:10] make a
[51:12] man and he must have made him in his
[51:14] image that's just a spiritual
[51:17] man well where the natural one come
[51:23] from but it come from the animals where
[51:25] animals come
[51:26] from you get what I'm saying see we
[51:30] think that we've got it all figured out
[51:32] and I'm
[51:33] sorry I wish to God that he had never
[51:35] called me to preach you think it never
[51:38] you you you think that brother Dale
[51:40] wants to preach show what he believ I'd
[51:42] love to
[51:44] quit just sit down cuz I bungled the
[51:48] whole thing up trying my best to get you
[51:50] to see the God I'm talking
[51:52] about I know I have cuz I just can't
[51:54] able to get get it into
[51:58] words just let somebody else take it and
[52:01] carry it on and break it
[52:04] down but until that time you're going to
[52:06] have to put up with me all right I put
[52:08] up with
[52:10] you okay we got a
[52:14] partnership yeah we have fun doing it
[52:18] all right we can sing Happy Birthday the
[52:22] only problem we got is he never has sung
[52:24] happy birthday three times
[52:26] in in April they sang it three times
[52:30] today get you the last a second get
[52:33] it but we have a wonderful time
[52:36] everybody looks at us on this internet
[52:37] system they probably die laughing they
[52:39] probably turn us on and the wackest
[52:41] quack as video message people I get but
[52:45] we have fun doing it but you know
[52:46] sometimes we get
[52:48] serious and you know God's been good to
[52:51] us but now
[52:54] look God dwells in
[52:58] heaven so wouldn't we realize that
[53:00] heaven is
[53:05] real he dwells in heaven right now
[53:09] brother D's out here in a Dimensions
[53:11] floating around he can be there
[53:14] too he can be anywhere he wants to like
[53:17] they asked me last night about
[53:19] it you know that one day when Jesus
[53:22] Christ
[53:24] died
[53:26] you know that his soul went to
[53:28] hell that's right you
[53:32] agree now if my soul went to hell I
[53:36] wouldn't be able to get
[53:38] out you better consider
[53:41] something so it wasn't this his soul
[53:44] went down like we think about what we
[53:46] are and it certainly wasn't you know the
[53:49] the uh the being because his body was
[53:52] laying in the
[53:53] grave but see he was capable of being
[53:56] able to move between all of those
[53:57] Dimensions that we can't you said but
[54:00] now wait a minute brother Brandon went
[54:02] to hell did Brother randam go to hell as
[54:04] a
[54:05] person if he did he can't get back
[54:08] out so you better be careful what you're
[54:10] saying that's right
[54:13] amen he went there in a vision right or
[54:16] translation or what you want to call it
[54:19] but you better believe that he was body
[54:21] he was laying back down there and
[54:22] wiggling on that bed when he was down
[54:24] there when that little boy was
[54:25] shot so his soul couldn't leave that
[54:28] body if it did the body's dead you
[54:31] better get it it
[54:32] straight think a little bit every once
[54:35] in a
[54:36] while instead of thinking you know so
[54:38] much about it but listen
[54:42] folks look what the prophet let's take a
[54:45] little bit we'll try to talk about
[54:46] heaven and then we've got to get to the
[54:48] point of and if I don't I'll just finish
[54:51] this up and then we'll take up Wednesday
[54:52] about uh sin originating in heaven
[54:56] but look what he says in
[54:58] 1961 uh
[55:00] number
[55:03] 1961 um
[55:05] 412 4 402 excuse me paragraph 136 the
[55:09] true Easter seal all right look what he
[55:12] says I tell you you read all up and down
[55:15] that's why give you the whole thing we
[55:16] can give you a short line quick just
[55:18] like that and I give you the whole quote
[55:20] I give it to them out on the internet
[55:21] they can sit and read up above there and
[55:24] they can see what is coming context is
[55:25] and they can come down and follow his
[55:27] context but then they can see what he's
[55:29] talking about I like to get it like
[55:31] that look what he says he talking about
[55:35] being out there on Mount uh Palmer in
[55:38] California and seeing those things now
[55:40] think look at through a
[55:42] telescope I
[55:45] think
[55:47] 120 million
[55:49] years of light
[55:53] space how many miles
[55:56] would that be to be broke
[56:01] down when light travels at so many feet
[56:04] per second and light is and am I right
[56:07] Aaron light is the only thing that's got
[56:08] one number the only stable thing is
[56:12] light and they can give you the exact
[56:14] how many feet it is and what all of this
[56:16] is look but yet Heaven is so many
[56:20] billions and billions and billions of
[56:23] light years beyond that
[56:30] are you reading
[56:32] it in other words they can look up to
[56:35] hundreds to 120 million years of light
[56:39] space evidently they've ever been able
[56:41] been able to look that
[56:44] far but he said Heaven is so much so
[56:48] many billions and billions and billions
[56:51] of light years beyond that till it's not
[56:55] even thought
[56:59] of how would we get
[57:02] there he said TR like I
[57:05] thought don't worry about it like I told
[57:07] him there last night brother brand I
[57:09] tell you what we keep listening to him
[57:10] you keep doing you going to find answer
[57:12] to every question you
[57:13] got and we're talking about how that
[57:15] Jesus when he was was there said don't
[57:17] touch me I'm not yet ascended he went up
[57:19] brother random said and this is quoting
[57:21] him he said he come back so
[57:23] fast till he come right to the
[57:28] wall science says you pass one object to
[57:31] the other object in the fourth dimension
[57:33] and it won't te it
[57:35] up brother Ram knew something what he
[57:37] talking about he said he came back so
[57:39] fast he W went right straight through
[57:41] the wall and could stand there and feel
[57:43] me then give me something to
[57:48] eat see we think of time and light and
[57:51] doings you know that's why brother man
[57:54] said I'd love have been able to talk to
[57:55] Einstein and said to been there to
[57:57] hearing when he made that great speech
[57:59] about the his finite
[58:03] Universe when Einstein says you look out
[58:05] like that and with unlimited eyesight
[58:08] you just keep looking straight out he
[58:09] said you see the back of your
[58:15] head what he
[58:18] say see we said that's impossible
[58:20] because everything is in a
[58:22] circular everything is in a war
[58:26] all of this stuff that we've seen for
[58:28] many years of all of that space travels
[58:30] and things like that it's not as far off
[58:32] as we
[58:33] think you know the Lost in Space that
[58:36] they went out and they couldn't come
[58:38] back see right now to be able to go
[58:40] without there's only one little
[58:42] Gap don't ask me what it means I don't
[58:44] know I just know they can't do it and
[58:46] it's sure it's funny if they can't go up
[58:48] on the clouds on now that's something a
[58:50] it they got sitting on a
[58:53] pad probably 2 or300 billion dollar
[58:57] worth of equipment sitting in one place
[59:00] and five or six guys sitting there and
[59:03] they're getting ready to go into outer
[59:04] space boy we go and ain't nothing
[59:06] control us about that time comes on so
[59:08] get out boys and come on back down cuz
[59:10] it's coming up a
[59:13] cloud oh boy ain't that silly cuz it's
[59:17] got something to do with that passing
[59:19] out and coming
[59:22] back I don't understand it I just what
[59:24] to say look what he says on the message
[59:27] the way of a true Prophet paragraph 172
[59:30] 1962 513 the morning service look what
[59:34] he says and if Heaven is so
[59:37] great and where we're going to then if
[59:41] we can't line up with a little bitty
[59:43] Petty things how how are we going to
[59:48] line up with the spirit there got to
[59:52] line with the word
[59:55] if we can't understand a little petty
[59:58] things here and get over all of that
[1:00:00] where are
[1:00:04] we questions and answers 1964 8:30 the
[1:00:07] morning service paragraph Was questions
[1:00:09] and answers part three I get uh
[1:00:12] paragraph
[1:00:14] 21 he's talking about negative and
[1:00:16] positive and the different things that
[1:00:18] are happening and the picture is
[1:00:21] absolutely this is the negative the
[1:00:23] negative part of life life is where
[1:00:25] we're living now in anything if there is
[1:00:27] a negative there's got to be a positive
[1:00:29] before there can be a negative therefore
[1:00:31] if it is a neg therefore if this is a
[1:00:34] negative there's got to be a positive
[1:00:38] somewhere and this ain't the real thing
[1:00:41] this is only a shadow of the real thing
[1:00:43] that is to come now you got it cuz it
[1:00:46] goes on up into the heavens he says you
[1:00:47] can't destroy
[1:00:49] it right it's in heaven you can't
[1:00:52] destroy
[1:00:53] it
[1:00:55] all of this could burn up right now
[1:00:56] everything we are whole atmosphere we're
[1:00:58] in could be annihilated it wouldn't
[1:01:00] touch one thing of Heaven that's right
[1:01:03] that's what brother Dale
[1:01:07] believes God I believe it's real yes sir
[1:01:11] okay I believe it's a real
[1:01:16] place but here's the thing that will
[1:01:18] cover for a little while cuz we got this
[1:01:19] a little
[1:01:23] bit that we think of the Angels being
[1:01:27] the first
[1:01:28] creation go ahead brother Joe and pull
[1:01:30] up the one where starts
[1:01:32] about which would be uh the greatest
[1:01:35] battle ever fought go ahead and just
[1:01:37] pull it up he's probably got it up there
[1:01:38] they get ahead of me most of the time
[1:01:41] they one splick second to a second ahead
[1:01:43] of
[1:01:45] but and we think about
[1:01:49] heaven now if you don't think about
[1:01:51] heaven being real I want you to than
[1:01:53] with me for just a a
[1:01:56] second I like to prove
[1:02:00] things you know the Bible says prove all
[1:02:03] things and the whole fast that which is
[1:02:05] good I like to prove it this is the way
[1:02:09] I like to prove
[1:02:10] it well brother Dale how do you know
[1:02:12] that heaven is
[1:02:15] real you ain't never been
[1:02:18] there you never had no visions of it
[1:02:20] have it no no no you never traveled
[1:02:22] there have you dreams or no no no no no
[1:02:26] well how do you know it's
[1:02:29] real because I believe the prophet of
[1:02:33] God that brought us the
[1:02:37] message now how many people how many
[1:02:41] theologians how many Scofield or
[1:02:44] whatever you know all of it they bounce
[1:02:46] up and down a little bit on the things
[1:02:48] and and not Scofield U the Great
[1:02:53] theologians
[1:02:55] but you know what makes me think about
[1:02:56] heaven being real more real than
[1:02:58] anything cuz that's where sin
[1:03:04] started I know I'm a funny thinking
[1:03:06] person I agree with
[1:03:08] you but that's where sin
[1:03:12] started it didn't start on earth right
[1:03:16] right CU you see only thing we got on
[1:03:18] Earth to talk about Sin Sin what is sin
[1:03:21] smok and drinking ging running around
[1:03:23] women and brother Brown kept emphasizing
[1:03:25] that's not
[1:03:33] sin do you do you get what I'm
[1:03:35] saying that makes me realize Heaven is
[1:03:38] more real than anything that I could
[1:03:40] ever think about is because sin become
[1:03:45] there now how many of us are saying how
[1:03:48] many people do you know or any doctrinal
[1:03:50] ideas that ever had any thought that sin
[1:03:53] originated in heaven
[1:03:55] no they wondering about down in the
[1:03:57] garden we don't know what happened we
[1:03:59] wasn't there you wasn't there nobody
[1:04:00] knows so we don't know we just what is
[1:04:02] just
[1:04:04] sin it started in
[1:04:07] heaven
[1:04:10] right now let's do away with some
[1:04:16] thoughts all
[1:04:19] right so it's impossible for
[1:04:22] sin to be drinking gambling smoking
[1:04:25] running around with women adulteries or
[1:04:27] anything that can't be
[1:04:31] sin cuz the Angels had no
[1:04:36] ability to do any of those things
[1:04:43] right case
[1:04:45] closed
[1:04:48] right see that's why people don't come
[1:04:50] and talk to me about it that's when I
[1:04:53] preach they won't come because what you
[1:04:54] going to do with
[1:04:56] that I mean what in all your carnalities
[1:04:58] and your arguments and you can argue all
[1:05:00] day long with me they going to be
[1:05:02] standing there holding up one
[1:05:05] finger then when you get through I got
[1:05:08] another statement to make which was the
[1:05:09] first
[1:05:11] one the angels have no gender they have
[1:05:14] no no Humanity or whatever you want to
[1:05:18] call it they have no ability drink smoke
[1:05:23] down
[1:05:24] but they were the first
[1:05:29] Sinners well brother you think all right
[1:05:31] drink smoke G it's all right if you want
[1:05:33] to be lost yeah it is it's all right go
[1:05:35] and do it if that's what you want to do
[1:05:37] just help yourself that's right cuz
[1:05:40] you're not a Christian
[1:05:41] anyway those are only displaying that's
[1:05:45] right the attribute of the unbelief
[1:05:47] that's inside of you that's right amen
[1:05:50] then inside of you is an unbelief that
[1:05:52] you need to deal with that's right but
[1:05:54] what do you mean brother I believe in
[1:05:56] God well now that's that's the thing
[1:05:58] we're going to deal with don't you
[1:05:59] believe that them Angels believed in
[1:06:03] God now we just plainly talking this
[1:06:06] afternoon I'll finish it Wednesday I
[1:06:08] know I won't get
[1:06:11] through but don't you believe them
[1:06:13] Angels believe in
[1:06:17] God but they wound up in sin
[1:06:21] right whether you want to call it a
[1:06:23] third of them 2/3 of them whatever you
[1:06:25] want to do it's feel a big
[1:06:28] number but I want you to remember too
[1:06:30] that ain't no telling how many billions
[1:06:32] of years that it took for those angels
[1:06:34] to go develop into unbelief
[1:06:41] right because Satan doesn't work fast
[1:06:44] that's
[1:06:47] right but those angels have no way of
[1:06:50] smoking drinking G and R around with
[1:06:53] women it wasn't made that way
[1:06:56] right but they were the original
[1:07:01] sinners now what happened
[1:07:09] there and what I want us to Simply think
[1:07:12] about is
[1:07:15] ourselves right right ourselves right
[1:07:19] yes higher
[1:07:21] higher some of you getting sleepy
[1:07:27] I want us to think about
[1:07:31] ourselves
[1:07:33] amen if I wrote down I said okay what I
[1:07:36] want you to do I want you Wednesday
[1:07:37] night to turn into definition to me of
[1:07:38] what sin is I wonder what we'd all have
[1:07:40] up wrote
[1:07:43] down well let's disbel God now the
[1:07:46] Angels never disbelieve God that's why
[1:07:49] brother brand said Eve in the garden she
[1:07:52] knew God was real she didn't disbelieve
[1:07:55] God being
[1:07:58] real right come on am I quoting the
[1:08:01] message
[1:08:03] amen what was eeve sin cuz what her sin
[1:08:06] was is what the sin was in
[1:08:08] heaven see all we seeing Eve some
[1:08:10] lustful sexual
[1:08:14] feelings get all that out of your mind
[1:08:16] until you get down to seeing what really
[1:08:18] sin
[1:08:21] is and a man stand like he is that was
[1:08:24] so dedicated to the word is he that he
[1:08:27] said I live have lived so close to God
[1:08:30] I'm quoting brother ROM he said I've
[1:08:31] lived so close to God till I forc the
[1:08:33] gifts and the things to
[1:08:35] work a man if you couldn't put one mark
[1:08:37] on his life right right oh they tried to
[1:08:41] do a lot of it they ain't done it
[1:08:44] yet but they said brother Bram do you
[1:08:46] see he said every
[1:08:51] day now what was he talking about
[1:08:59] well we got a definition we don't
[1:09:00] practice that's still old bad this
[1:09:02] Presbyterian Doctrine you know we use
[1:09:04] that word where it said don't commit sin
[1:09:06] we translated that over into practice
[1:09:08] and start boy we thought it had fig all
[1:09:10] figured
[1:09:13] out the prophet of God said I sin every
[1:09:16] day the Bible
[1:09:19] says anything that is not a faith is
[1:09:25] sin we automatically you ate too
[1:09:29] much no you just don't to get
[1:09:35] sick you say it's a sin to eat too much
[1:09:39] well then let's just break it on down a
[1:09:40] little further
[1:09:42] then if you're going to count this sin
[1:09:45] as being eaten too
[1:09:48] much and then you you you justify it by
[1:09:52] saying look at the poor world out there
[1:09:56] that doesn't have anything to
[1:09:58] eat well why don't you cut down a couple
[1:10:01] of more potions of what of the eat of
[1:10:03] that day and send it to
[1:10:09] them oh brother Dale talks too straight
[1:10:13] don't
[1:10:14] he you get what I'm saying
[1:10:19] yes like brother mon said you take a 55
[1:10:22] gallon drum you fill it up with water is
[1:10:23] full you take a 3/4 in water pipe you
[1:10:26] fill it up with water it's
[1:10:28] full sure we do we destroy our bodies by
[1:10:33] eating too much yes
[1:10:37] yes but then we want to make some sin as
[1:10:40] some little some form CU we've developed
[1:10:42] enough to know that it's not the great
[1:10:46] big so now we're going to be dealing on
[1:10:48] sin this service and probably another
[1:10:50] 10 I'm going take 20
[1:10:54] but look what brother Rand had to
[1:10:58] say the first great battle 1962 311 the
[1:11:03] greatest battle ever fought paragraph
[1:11:07] 62 this great first battle that was ever
[1:11:11] fought began in heaven when Michael and
[1:11:15] his angels fought against Lucifer and
[1:11:17] his
[1:11:18] angels it first started the first battle
[1:11:21] was in heaven so see did not originate
[1:11:25] on Earth it originated in heaven and
[1:11:29] then it was thrown down from
[1:11:32] heaven cast out of Heaven to the Earth
[1:11:36] and fell on human beings then the battle
[1:11:40] from Angels become human
[1:11:46] battles
[1:11:50] right so when at when Satan
[1:11:59] sinned
[1:12:01] remember it was a created
[1:12:06] being the
[1:12:08] first we'll get to why he got upset see
[1:12:11] CU he thought he was a right-and
[1:12:13] man and he
[1:12:15] was he just didn't understand the
[1:12:20] story but we've got to cover a little
[1:12:23] part right here see the first thing in
[1:12:25] heaven was Angels created everybody with
[1:12:26] me for this morning first thing in
[1:12:28] heaven was Angels that's you're still in
[1:12:30] heaven uh now before we get to the sin
[1:12:33] of what is finished and I want to say it
[1:12:35] because what brother around just said he
[1:12:37] said it started in heaven and then came
[1:12:39] to Earth so
[1:12:41] Somewhere in
[1:12:46] Heaven that logos theophany word Angel
[1:12:49] Son of God U Halo of light
[1:12:55] had
[1:12:56] created a
[1:13:04] world
[1:13:08] okay he had created a
[1:13:14] world you're going to see what I'm
[1:13:15] talking about just a second so you go to
[1:13:17] Genesis 1 and what do you
[1:13:19] find why would brother random find me a
[1:13:22] place that brother random didn't make
[1:13:23] this statement when he quoted the
[1:13:25] scripture he'd always say in the
[1:13:27] beginning God God created the heavens
[1:13:29] and the Earth period is that right
[1:13:33] he you remember his little girl said
[1:13:36] Daddy said to the world is millions of
[1:13:39] years
[1:13:43] old and he said that's
[1:13:48] right he said because honey God created
[1:13:51] the heavens and the Earth perod he said
[1:13:53] he could let it goone for millions of
[1:13:55] millions of
[1:13:57] years that's
[1:13:59] right now let's go back and read this
[1:14:03] see that's where I love the Bible let's
[1:14:05] read the Bible go back to Genesis 1 okay
[1:14:07] we'll just stay with what part we can
[1:14:08] get to and then we'll just pick up the
[1:14:10] rest of it
[1:14:18] Wednesday I want you to watch
[1:14:22] something
[1:14:26] we try to make the days in the garden
[1:14:28] that's
[1:14:31] right but we're going to read that the
[1:14:34] world come into existence was not the
[1:14:37] creation of the first
[1:14:39] day get your
[1:14:44] Bible are you with
[1:14:47] me that wasn't the first day my brother
[1:14:51] Brown
[1:14:52] said
[1:14:54] period every time he said he could laid
[1:14:58] for millions of
[1:15:00] years yes so let's see what this world
[1:15:03] look
[1:15:04] like in the beginning God see doesn't
[1:15:07] have any trouble there and you translate
[1:15:10] that word God over and that word God is
[1:15:13] translated from Elohim you got a scull
[1:15:15] field Bible right down under
[1:15:18] it so it does brother him to call him
[1:15:22] God and it's not in a capital
[1:15:26] letter as it appears in a couple of
[1:15:28] chapters
[1:15:30] later we've been through that right in
[1:15:33] the beginning God created the heavens
[1:15:35] and the Earth
[1:15:38] period now what did it look like let's
[1:15:40] still get in the first day now we got to
[1:15:41] get verse three to get the first
[1:15:44] day what does it look
[1:15:51] like and the Earth Earth was without
[1:15:54] form and
[1:15:59] void meaning no
[1:16:02] life and without a definite
[1:16:06] form
[1:16:08] okay and
[1:16:10] darkness was upon the face of the
[1:16:15] deep and the spirit of God moved upon
[1:16:17] the face of the waters then he started
[1:16:21] day one with verse tree and begin to
[1:16:24] create light you get what brother random
[1:16:26] is saying you get what he's
[1:16:28] emphasizing could laid millions of
[1:16:30] billions of years in that
[1:16:33] state all right now let's reread what we
[1:16:35] just read from Brother
[1:16:38] Brown
[1:16:41] okay go back brother Joe to number six
[1:16:44] on your notes the greatest battle ever
[1:16:47] fought
[1:16:49] 1962
[1:16:52] six PR 62 and
[1:16:56] look this great first battle that was
[1:16:58] ever fought began in heaven when Michael
[1:17:00] and his Angel was fought against lucier
[1:17:01] and his angels it first started the
[1:17:04] first battle was in heaven so sin did
[1:17:06] not originate on Earth it originated in
[1:17:08] heaven and then it was thrown down from
[1:17:12] heaven cast out of Heaven to the Earth
[1:17:16] and fell on human
[1:17:19] beings all right what kind of a battle
[1:17:22] took place in
[1:17:24] heaven oh people this man you know this
[1:17:28] Michael he knows more about karate he
[1:17:30] just he he know everything and no I
[1:17:33] don't think so that's
[1:17:38] right I think when it come and you can
[1:17:40] take my ATT fart whatever you want to
[1:17:42] you got
[1:17:43] yours there come a time as I said this
[1:17:48] morning that what took care of those
[1:17:51] angels during all of that time
[1:17:55] that they were planning to take over cuz
[1:17:58] that's what Lucifer was
[1:18:01] doing he was planning to take over yes
[1:18:05] who took care of that is because God
[1:18:08] turned his back some way turned his mind
[1:18:12] how does he keep from seeing you and I
[1:18:15] sinning his Omni presence would make him
[1:18:17] know exactly what we do that's right but
[1:18:21] he's got something between doesn't
[1:18:24] him but after a while when it was all
[1:18:28] finished Michael said hold
[1:18:32] it and I'm sure he probably draw a
[1:18:36] line on the floor of
[1:18:39] heaven he said all it's on God's side
[1:18:41] get over
[1:18:46] here he said right
[1:18:48] Lucifer all is on your side get over
[1:18:51] there right
[1:18:54] he turned to him and he said into outer
[1:18:57] Darkness shall you
[1:19:01] go see because outter Darkness had
[1:19:04] already been created that's what I'm
[1:19:06] getting you at first he created angels
[1:19:08] then that logos stood there and created
[1:19:10] a
[1:19:12] world but it was in outer
[1:19:17] Darkness I even believe in The Big Bang
[1:19:21] Theory
[1:19:23] you want brother Brown's Big Bang
[1:19:27] Theory The Big Bang Theory is what that
[1:19:30] it was all once of gases and molecule
[1:19:32] that everything was in one and then all
[1:19:34] at once it started slinging on and that
[1:19:35] started slinging off and it was caused
[1:19:37] by an explosion from internal that just
[1:19:39] sent everything scattering through you
[1:19:41] know and it was once a big ball lot you
[1:19:43] want brother brand to tell you about
[1:19:44] that I didn't bring because I think he
[1:19:47] needed
[1:19:49] that he said Dar was and said what did
[1:19:51] he do he said it's all just gases and
[1:19:55] said he just starts slinging off
[1:19:57] clinkers you ever heard him say that he
[1:19:59] said he throw it out said it went for a
[1:20:01] 100 million years he said he stopped
[1:20:05] it he off goes another one he said
[1:20:08] what's he doing he's creating the
[1:20:10] Stars he said what's he really doing
[1:20:13] said he's writing his
[1:20:16] Bible in the star brother R bu believed
[1:20:20] in come some form of a Big Bang Theory
[1:20:24] and I like his theory the best but all
[1:20:27] come out the same thing MH it's just
[1:20:29] science trying to explain it and they
[1:20:31] can explain it that's true They're
[1:20:33] bringing back stuff from these other
[1:20:35] planets now but you know
[1:20:38] what they're finding on some of these
[1:20:40] other planets now that it could be the
[1:20:43] earliest form of any form of life there
[1:20:48] is no life there but all of the things
[1:20:51] are there are you reading what what
[1:20:52] you're bringing
[1:20:57] back see it all com for one
[1:21:00] time God said let there
[1:21:03] be he slung it out who done that Jesus
[1:21:07] Christ the word the logos of
[1:21:10] theop and he let it all sling but it was
[1:21:12] in
[1:21:16] darkness and when Satan was cast out of
[1:21:18] heaven where was he put outer Darkness
[1:21:24] this
[1:21:25] Earth is not this Earth our the domain
[1:21:28] of the
[1:21:29] devil you want the scriptures you want
[1:21:32] brother
[1:21:33] brandham he said I'll give you the
[1:21:35] scriptures where every Kingdom in the
[1:21:36] world belongs to the
[1:21:39] devil that's
[1:21:41] right said he even tried to give them to
[1:21:46] Jesus it was made his domain so you see
[1:21:50] brother randam is not just quoting
[1:21:52] something to make us my children to
[1:21:54] understand he said in the beginning God
[1:21:56] created the Heaven and the Earth perod
[1:21:57] he said he could let it late for
[1:21:58] millions and millions of years amen so
[1:22:01] Satan could have been here on Earth for
[1:22:03] millions and millions of
[1:22:07] years in
[1:22:11] darkness okay simply giving you a run
[1:22:15] through all
[1:22:17] right so let's talk about him in just a
[1:22:19] minute
[1:22:21] now if sin originated in heaven what was
[1:22:24] that
[1:22:26] sin it could not have been that the
[1:22:28] Angels didn't believe in
[1:22:31] God cuz there he
[1:22:37] was so let's go on down a little bit
[1:22:39] deeper than to just think about you say
[1:22:41] well but Brother D I believe in God I
[1:22:44] believe everything brother Brown
[1:22:47] says how many quotes
[1:22:50] that but where are they when the church
[1:22:52] doors open
[1:22:58] say it okay
[1:23:01] S I believe everything brother R said
[1:23:04] brother said you do not have to have
[1:23:06] something to tell you it's wrong to
[1:23:07] commit
[1:23:09] adultery then you don't believe if you
[1:23:11] do
[1:23:13] that okay
[1:23:16] soloft you know what I mean by k s
[1:23:18] somebody out there might not know what
[1:23:20] that means to us it just means tell me
[1:23:22] something that's say cuz you can't do
[1:23:25] it and then laid the case out and it's
[1:23:27] soft well that don't matter to me I tell
[1:23:29] you what I believe what I want to
[1:23:30] believe you just go right and believe
[1:23:31] what you want to believe anyway cuz you
[1:23:34] are but one day we'll find out that's
[1:23:38] and it won't be this man looking down on
[1:23:40] you as a stick of hatred and say I tried
[1:23:44] to tell you it'll be the same tears
[1:23:46] within my eyes are saying I tried my
[1:23:48] best to tell you about this
[1:23:51] God
[1:23:54] Amen to see God and see how real he is
[1:23:58] to see Heaven and the
[1:23:59] things look down on what we're going
[1:24:01] let's read a couple and this we'll quit
[1:24:03] on 10 then we'll start
[1:24:05] Wednesday the unfailing realities of the
[1:24:08] Living God preached in 196 626 paragraph
[1:24:13] 225 remember sin didn't begin on Earth
[1:24:17] sin began in
[1:24:18] heaven when Lucifer taken and made him
[1:24:23] watch he said I want a
[1:24:29] denomination
[1:24:35] oh that's where we all come
[1:24:41] from but how much do we still have
[1:24:45] left as brother Mo used to make a good
[1:24:47] statement he said you can take your coat
[1:24:50] and hat and you can walk out of one
[1:24:52] Church and stick it up on the wall of
[1:24:53] another one what good have you done you
[1:24:57] still got the same
[1:25:00] Doctrine true Satan wanted a
[1:25:03] denomination that's
[1:25:07] right course he was going to be the head
[1:25:09] of it
[1:25:13] right he said I want a
[1:25:16] denomination make a great big
[1:25:19] thing went on the North Country Now he
[1:25:22] in the Bible as I said this morning you
[1:25:23] study the kingdom of the north and
[1:25:25] that's where the the king is to come
[1:25:26] down and then you get into worship alar
[1:25:28] and you'll find the North and the things
[1:25:30] and all this got involved with it all
[1:25:32] right went on the North country and set
[1:25:36] up a bigger thing than Michael had and
[1:25:39] he was kicked out of
[1:25:47] heaven he just simply pulled a group
[1:25:49] with
[1:25:50] him went over
[1:25:54] and he says now boys I'll read you in a
[1:25:56] minute where he said he didn't believe
[1:25:58] his
[1:26:01] boss and he says
[1:26:06] boys I I'm not trying to be
[1:26:11] anything don't you see that in the
[1:26:12] preachers of the
[1:26:14] message I'm not trying to that sickens
[1:26:17] me when a preacher he's paid to preach
[1:26:18] he comes in to preach he's assigned to
[1:26:20] preach and what's the first thing he
[1:26:21] said
[1:26:24] I I'm just the least one among you but
[1:26:26] it just fa my lot to preach well why
[1:26:30] don't you shut up let somebody else do
[1:26:32] it amen if you're that good he ain't
[1:26:35] meaning that
[1:26:39] to no he's wanting to get you in his
[1:26:41] pocket want to get you with him and this
[1:26:44] well he's so
[1:26:46] sweet now you think the devil he went
[1:26:48] you think the devil he went around there
[1:26:50] you know and he went up this Ang said
[1:26:52] now let me take you you going to believe
[1:26:56] me I'm the guy in charge I'm just you
[1:26:59] see where I stand don't you I stand
[1:27:02] beside the
[1:27:05] Lord now I don't think the devil is not
[1:27:09] that dumb you might think so but I
[1:27:12] don't he's very very
[1:27:18] deceiving he tried to get them to see
[1:27:21] his Doctrine
[1:27:23] his
[1:27:29] denomination
[1:27:31] okay message called why preached in 1965
[1:27:35] 309 paragraph
[1:27:39] E34 he said talking about heart trouble
[1:27:42] is not the number
[1:27:43] one heart and I said heart trouble's not
[1:27:46] the number one sin trouble now listen to
[1:27:49] it and what is sin sin is not not
[1:27:52] smoking cigarettes sin is not committing
[1:27:54] adultery sin is not drinking swearing
[1:27:56] that's the attributes of sin there's
[1:27:59] only one sin that's
[1:28:02] unbelief any man if he lives as holy and
[1:28:05] Pious and as good as he could be and yet
[1:28:09] say it say that the days of Miracles is
[1:28:14] passed and deny the scripture saying
[1:28:17] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and
[1:28:20] day forever that man is a sinner cuz
[1:28:23] he's an unbeliever right good
[1:28:28] definition don't matter how holy and
[1:28:34] P now how many of us and I don't like to
[1:28:38] don't raise your hand I just asked a
[1:28:40] question how many of us back before we
[1:28:42] heard of this message believe that Jesus
[1:28:44] Christ was the same yesterday today for
[1:28:46] oh we quoted it yeah we read it we got
[1:28:49] to GH St we read that scripture
[1:28:55] but did we believe
[1:28:57] it the
[1:29:00] Antichrist John tells you what it
[1:29:03] is any spirit that denies that Jesus
[1:29:06] Christ is present tense come in the
[1:29:10] flesh is
[1:29:13] Antichrist if you don't believe Jesus
[1:29:15] Christ is now standing in people of this
[1:29:17] day you do you are an
[1:29:20] unbeliever that's right
[1:29:22] trying to get you to see how
[1:29:24] simple
[1:29:30] simple
[1:29:35] sin to
[1:29:41] disbelief so Satan as I said he just
[1:29:45] goes among the
[1:29:48] crowd and now
[1:29:50] listen
[1:29:52] let's get down to where we at in the
[1:29:54] message there's not anybody the big guys
[1:29:57] in this message who will stand up and
[1:29:58] say I'll tell you what I'm I'm the guy
[1:29:59] in
[1:30:00] charge I'm the fell you're supposed to
[1:30:02] listen to now there may be one or two

[1:30:07] can name a few if you want that said I

[1:38:08] quick if he can't find it he get it
[1:38:10] there quick as I start reading and all
[1:38:12] of us know that he was the Antichrist he
[1:38:15] worked a very closest hand to Christ now
[1:38:19] who's he talking about you talking about
[1:38:22] Judas number
[1:38:25] one CU he's the closest to Christ he was
[1:38:28] the secretary treasure that's right
[1:38:31] right that's right but look what it goes
[1:38:34] on his right-and man did you know that
[1:38:37] in heaven that the devil was God's
[1:38:39] right- hand man in the beginning that
[1:38:41] Lucifer the son of the morning was given
[1:38:43] power and the reason he brought sin into
[1:38:47] the world he was able to take something
[1:38:50] that God God had created and perverted
[1:38:54] back into an evil thing which started
[1:38:57] all this trouble in the beginning then
[1:39:00] God back before the foundation of the
[1:39:03] world was ever laid when he seen what
[1:39:06] Satan done in his
[1:39:13] pride
[1:39:15] pride is't that what the scripture said
[1:39:18] Pride goes before
[1:39:20] fall what is
[1:39:26] pride you know what amazed
[1:39:29] me I mean I remember the day I first
[1:39:31] read
[1:39:34] it what was those seven demons that was
[1:39:37] cast out of Mary
[1:39:40] Magdalene oh anybody tell what it is it
[1:39:42] was lust it was desires it was all kind
[1:39:46] of
[1:39:47] things you haven't read the
[1:39:50] message
[1:39:55] brother Rand said it was
[1:39:57] Pride I'll get to these when if we get
[1:39:59] back to
[1:40:01] it he called them demons not one of them
[1:40:04] did he call any lust whatsoever that was
[1:40:07] in Mary
[1:40:10] Magdalene it was Pride
[1:40:14] boastful
[1:40:19] beautiful right
[1:40:23] see we think it was all kind
[1:40:25] of yeah CU we seen too many
[1:40:29] movies we've been in life too long right
[1:40:33] do we think we know what was wrong with
[1:40:37] Mary now if I miss this was it right now
[1:40:41] and if it is I'll tell you if it ain't
[1:40:42] I'll bring it back to
[1:40:44] you that one of those in there brother
[1:40:48] Brandon said
[1:40:49] that she thought saw the religious
[1:40:53] world and how wrong it
[1:41:00] was and said she turned to the street of
[1:41:08] prostitution be glad to find that
[1:41:11] one but you already to see it's
[1:41:15] right she saw the
[1:41:19] religion and how that it wouldn't worth
[1:41:23] nothing we laugh at the you
[1:41:28] know but look at a group of people over
[1:41:32] there that those Pharisees all of their
[1:41:37] life they spend their life
[1:41:41] serving a
[1:41:44] God that to them no longer
[1:41:48] exist yet they're willing to fight the
[1:41:50] the world over
[1:41:52] him but right on the other side of the
[1:41:54] street is the Hindu Muslim if I get all
[1:41:57] that wrong you put it in the right one
[1:42:00] okay and they every
[1:42:02] day one
[1:42:04] hour they get down
[1:42:07] and crawl on the ground and they
[1:42:13] pray I saw it the magazine one time for
[1:42:17] us to pray in school and lock you up
[1:42:19] right
[1:42:21] right in New York they have been having
[1:42:25] prayers I don't really know how long but
[1:42:29] those people get down and block the
[1:42:32] streets and pray for
[1:42:37] hours they don't lock them
[1:42:42] up
[1:42:43] right so it goes to show who's going to
[1:42:45] be in command one of these
[1:42:48] days but what are you talking about I'm
[1:42:50] talking but don't call it
[1:42:57] sincerity they have a
[1:42:59] month that they don't need certain
[1:43:01] things they have a month of fasting they
[1:43:04] have a month they have this that and
[1:43:06] what do we
[1:43:09] have you said we don't have to do that
[1:43:11] stuff to be
[1:43:13] Christians you don't have to act like
[1:43:15] the devil and try to claim you one
[1:43:17] either right amen right I don't look
[1:43:21] down on those
[1:43:23] people I've been to the

[1:43:37] tried and you wait and see there'll be
[1:43:40] one walk in that door back there that'll
[1:43:41] have a turban on his
[1:43:43] head and we'll ask him to remove it and
[1:43:47] then we'll be in
[1:43:49] jail
[1:43:51] CU he will not remove it but I will
[1:43:54] stand in his face and tell him
[1:43:56] Mister I've been to your
[1:43:58] mosque I take my shoes off in
[1:44:01] respect you take that off in respect or
[1:44:05] leave and I'll be in

[1:44:23] service station and buy some
[1:44:27] gas now all belong to some
[1:44:30] people go to motel before you get home

[1:44:37] people what's going to happen when they
[1:44:40] refuse to sell you gasoline and all they
[1:44:44] want you to do is just say recognize us
[1:44:48] as being a religious belief
[1:44:54] that's all there was in
[1:44:56] heaven Satan was saying just recognize
[1:45:03] us now Lord don't we worship more than
[1:45:06] these
[1:45:10] others he never has stopped worshiping
[1:45:14] God see we think of the guy with the
[1:45:17] horns and the red
[1:45:19] suit
[1:45:21] he never been
[1:45:22] that brother R said he's a Slicker in
[1:45:24] the P pit
[1:45:27] right so you better know who's in the
[1:45:35] pit but think on these things what is
[1:45:37] sin just think about that to
[1:45:40] Wednesday and we'll get the rest of
[1:45:42] these quotes out to where Satan got
[1:45:48] jealous he said he didn't like his boss
[1:45:53] jealousy
[1:45:56] Pride
[1:46:00] beautiful his anointing is in the the uh
[1:46:05] Stones
[1:46:10] beautiful we study a little bit about
[1:46:12] Satan till we get
[1:46:16] back but just think about
[1:46:19] unbelief
[1:46:23] you said I believe everything brother
[1:46:24] Ram said but one
[1:46:29] thing that makes us a
[1:46:32] sinner no no me brother I don't
[1:46:36] understand well why did you say you
[1:46:38] didn't believe it why did you just say
[1:46:40] you didn't understand
[1:46:43] it think you say I don't understand
[1:46:46] it I told you about the Daniel 70 weeks
[1:46:49] AG we should see my book
[1:46:51] years ago ever right on the side of the
[1:46:53] page I had a question question question
[1:46:55] question question cuz I didn't know what
[1:46:57] he's talking about and I kept reading
[1:47:00] and praying and studying I'd go back and
[1:47:02] sometimes I'd be able to take one of
[1:47:03] those question marks off I would never
[1:47:06] preach any message on Daniel 70 weeks
[1:47:08] until ever question mark was
[1:47:14] erased I spend more time trying to turn
[1:47:17] down my sermon a lot of times than I do
[1:47:19] in trying to build
[1:47:24] it why because I don't want it to be an
[1:47:31] unbelief and I realize that just one
[1:47:33] word planted into your heart in the
[1:47:36] wrong
[1:47:37] way will bring out a seed of
[1:47:42] unbelief thinkk on these things go ahead

[1:49:47] scriptures being 1
[1:49:49] Corinthians 11:23 cuz everything is
[1:49:52] provided and ready for
[1:49:55] us for I have received of the Lord that
[1:49:57] which also I delivered unto you that the
[1:50:00] Lord Jesus the same
[1:50:02] night which he excuse me which he was
[1:50:06] betrayed took bread when he had given
[1:50:08] thanks he broke it and said take it this
[1:50:10] is my body which is broken for you this
[1:50:13] do in remembrance of me after the same
[1:50:15] manner also he took the cup when he had
[1:50:17] St saying this cup is the New Testament
[1:50:19] in my blood
[1:50:20] this do you as often as you drink it in
[1:50:22] remembrance of me for as often as you
[1:50:24] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:50:26] sh the Lord's death till he come
[1:50:28] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:50:30] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:50:31] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:50:34] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:50:36] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:50:38] that bread and drink of that cup for he
[1:50:40] that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:50:41] eateth and drinketh down to himself not
[1:50:45] Discerning the Lord's body for this
[1:50:47] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:50:49] and many sleep for if we would judge
[1:50:51] ourselves we should not be judged but
[1:50:53] when we are judged we are chasen to the
[1:50:54] Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:50:56] with the world wherefore my brethren
[1:50:58] when you come together to eat t one for
[1:51:01] another and if any man hunger let him
[1:51:03] eat at home that he come not together
[1:51:06] under condemnation the rest will I set
[1:51:08] in order when I
[1:51:10] come take on these
[1:51:13] things sister Gail yes do you have the
[1:51:16] little bottle of rub on your hands
[1:51:20] you have in your
[1:51:22] pocketbook I think
[1:51:26] so if not I'll rot some oil on my hand
[1:51:28] and break the
[1:51:30] bread because I've been coughing and
[1:51:32] holding my hand over my mouth and I
[1:51:33] don't want anybody else to think any
[1:51:35] problems have any troubles to wor that
[1:51:38] they would think it would be anything
[1:51:39] wrong who got it sister Regina you got
[1:51:42] some all right and we'll do it I need to
[1:51:45] put me a little bottle up here to where
[1:51:46] we can do it cuz I don't want to hinder
[1:51:48] nobody's believing or are thinking I
[1:51:51] don't fragance this is a free one H
[1:51:54] fragrance
[1:52:01] oh I might do my hands more often
[1:52:04] man I'm not I'm throwing off on nobody
[1:52:07] now I understand everybody's human and
[1:52:09] some people they just don't want to they
[1:52:11] think and they be standing there
[1:52:12] thinking well he broke that bread see
[1:52:14] the devil's on your shoulders he broke
[1:52:15] that bread and he's done been coughing
[1:52:17] all over his hands and things but uh so
[1:52:21] we just put that to rest but the Bible
[1:52:23] said that they tied for a
[1:52:26] moment so let's just pray one for
[1:52:28] another that God would bless
[1:52:41] us bless each one Lord we commit
[1:52:44] everything into your hands in Jesus name
[1:52:48] amen the Bible said he took bread and he
[1:52:51] blessed it father this bread was made
[1:52:54] for the purpose today for this time and
[1:52:58] we accept it as coming from you and you
[1:53:00] gave it to us we ask you now that you'd
[1:53:02] sanctify it and Lord we know that it's
[1:53:06] just a symbol yet it still has a lot of
[1:53:08] meaning to that symbol so we ask you to
[1:53:11] just sanctify the bread and the
[1:53:12] partakers that we may be one together in
[1:53:15] Jesus
[1:53:18] name
[1:53:24] it was the broken
[1:53:26] body that was broken for each one of us
[1:53:30] there not a round wer you know not a
[1:53:32] soda
[1:53:33] cracker wouldn't made for
[1:53:36] that made
[1:53:39] dedicated to where that it would be
[1:53:42] right in the
[1:53:44] symbols you know seeing people healed by
[1:53:47] taking it so they he healing virtues and
[1:53:50] whatever our mind and our thinking about
[1:53:52] the the things of
[1:53:56] life but you see back there in the Old
[1:53:58] Testament they couldn't understand it
[1:54:00] but as Wade was bringing out one time
[1:54:01] they had a special little place there
[1:54:04] they never could understand what was
[1:54:05] going on but when it come forth then
[1:54:08] that's what Jesus Took the
[1:54:10] bread you know and done what he done
[1:54:13] with it it wasn't just something that
[1:54:15] was new it already a part of their ways
[1:54:19] and Customs but it had never been
[1:54:21] understood as to what it was until he
[1:54:25] came
[1:54:26] along and instituted
[1:54:31] it father we thank you for this wine
[1:54:33] that's been made for this purpose and we
[1:54:36] believe that it's the type of your
[1:54:37] spirit of the Living God that dwells
[1:54:39] with each and every one of us and as we
[1:54:41] eat the bread and the example and then
[1:54:44] we drank this little piece of we eat the
[1:54:46] little piece of bread and we drank this
[1:54:47] little bit of wine to tomorrow it will
[1:54:50] be blood cells in our body helping us to
[1:54:52] live Lord we thank you for that we ask
[1:54:55] you to sanctify the wine and the
[1:54:57] partakers in Jesus name
[1:55:09] amen come
[1:55:11] morning
[1:55:13] I by the
[1:55:17] river I'll rest kn
[1:55:21] the
[1:55:22] Ever Green
[1:55:25] Tree I'll
[1:55:28] carry my
[1:55:30] cross through the
[1:55:33] midnight Come
[1:55:36] Morning
[1:55:38] Glory for
[1:55:41] me sometimes I'm
[1:55:45] despised and
[1:55:48] rejected and I question oh
[1:55:53] Father
[1:55:56] how then I take one more look at Mount
[1:56:04] calary and it gives me the strength to
[1:56:10] go
[1:56:10] on why come morning some morning between
[1:56:15] 600 and
[1:56:17] 9:00 River something's going
[1:56:23] happen and brother Richard talking about
[1:56:25] it this morning I don't believe we're
[1:56:27] going out of here with Lambs missing and
[1:56:30] things I don't believe we're going out
[1:56:32] of here in sick bodies you know Sister
[1:56:35] Trudy we're talking about last night
[1:56:37] talking about her eyesight I said what
[1:56:40] if God changes it right here and Chang
[1:56:42] the rest of your body in one Split
[1:56:43] Second after then what has it got to do
[1:56:45] with it that's right it could be
[1:56:47] standing there with an arm missing and
[1:56:48] it be restored all at once and then gone
[1:56:50] but you know what I look for it to be
[1:56:52] done before
[1:56:56] then I believe it can be done
[1:56:58] now I believe your eyesight can be
[1:57:01] healed just now you say what's keeping
[1:57:03] it from being healed I
[1:57:08] believe sometime God just wants to see
[1:57:11] if we
[1:57:12] believe and he just holds off a little
[1:57:17] bit Let's us run our
[1:57:20] course and get through and then he just
[1:57:23] simply comes
[1:57:25] down yes and just takes care of
[1:57:28] things cuz he's a wonderful God you see
[1:57:31] we're trying to make it
[1:57:33] work we're trying to make it in some
[1:57:37] way you
[1:57:38] know that God has to come and
[1:57:44] uh do it he don't have to do
[1:57:48] nothing he's God right he in no form has
[1:57:52] to do
[1:57:54] anything you remember brother randam got
[1:57:56] in trouble because he said God you owe
[1:57:58] me he said he let me pout it out for
[1:58:00] about 3
[1:58:02] months now that's a
[1:58:04] prophet he said he let me pout it out
[1:58:06] about 3 months then he come to me and
[1:58:08] explained it to
[1:58:10] me but you see we think we're so
[1:58:12] something don't worry about it just go
[1:58:17] on what does it matter
[1:58:21] I mean I got two tests to be run this
[1:58:23] week or two things I'm still waiting on
[1:58:25] the answers
[1:58:27] to what if it comes back and says you're
[1:58:29] eat up with
[1:58:31] cancer you know what I say so
[1:58:37] what you said brother Dale that's the
[1:58:39] way you you'd be yeah that's exactly the
[1:58:41] way I'd
[1:58:43] be so
[1:58:48] what God don't owe us
[1:58:53] nothing if he's true with this gift
[1:58:56] where do you think all of the tracting
[1:58:58] has been right here in my throat over 30
[1:59:01] years right here that he's tried to shut
