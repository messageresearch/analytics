[19:54] baked potato salad or chicken baked
[19:57] potato and salad so it's going to be not
[19:59] be like a buffet style it's going to be
[20:01] more like going to a restaurant and
[20:04] having white napkins and and having a um
[20:07] you know somebody playing no just
[20:10] kidding maybe a mariachi band but it's
[20:12] not going to
[20:14] be no good to have brother Ben Jackson
[20:17] with us I know everybody's wondering who
[20:19] is this
[20:20] guy he comes from Connecticut and don't
[20:23] hold that against him shake his hand say
[20:25] God bless you from the south and I'm
[20:28] sure it's like Five Below 1,000° up
[20:31] there right now and 24 in of snow so we
[20:33] don't have that down here but we have
[20:35] had cold weather though and we
[20:37] appreciate the Lord helping Brother
[20:38] Anderson getting his uh water turned
[20:40] back on but brother Ben goes to brother
[20:42] Craig Bo's Church never met him before
[20:45] heard of him for many years but never
[20:46] met him before maybe I get to meet him
[20:48] and also as somebody said Mester is here
[20:51] so what the heck so um and they go to
[20:54] somebody's Church down in buer South
[20:56] Carolina so they'll be gone after the
[20:57] first service so we don't have to worry
[20:59] about him no
[21:01] more always good to have you with us you
[21:03] know that amen always good to have
[21:05] brother Mike and I tell him I see him
[21:07] all the time cuz I watch brother Jason
[21:08] online cuz brother Jason's a good good
[21:10] Minister and um got some good wisdom and
[21:13] he's always sitting behind him and his
[21:15] dad sitting behind him you know playing
[21:16] instruments so we appreciate that he's
[21:18] still playing those instruments and I
[21:20] hadn't seen Esther sing there yet before
[21:22] but maybe I missed something maybe I
[21:25] missed it okay okay well good to be in
[21:27] the house with Lord just just um tell
[21:29] brother Ben we appreciate you coming bud
[21:31] and and you're not a visitor anymore so
[21:33] you've come with us and and we sure
[21:35] appreciate you and uh and we love you
[21:38] with love of the Lord and tell brother
[21:39] Craig when you get back that we said
[21:40] hello amen he won't know who we are but
[21:43] he has probably heard of brother Dale
[21:44] I'm sure so let's we're going to start a
[21:47] little bit different today we're going
[21:49] to start into the church ages I really
[21:52] enjoyed U uh getting back into church
[21:55] age book this past week and been staying
[21:58] with Dad a little bit and so I just took
[22:00] the church AE book and opened it up and
[22:01] was walking around with him and I just
[22:03] reading it actually I stole his church
[22:05] AE book so uh it had all the cheat sheet
[22:09] in it you know so I was reading his
[22:10] quote what he had written down before
[22:12] there was a concordance I was reading
[22:14] you know and I said okay all right I
[22:15] remember that and I'll go back and check
[22:16] it out but it's been refreshing so what
[22:18] we're going to do today is we're going
[22:20] to talk about that we got to get through
[22:21] the church ages and we got to see who
[22:24] this is because when we went through
[22:25] that statue of perfect man that's him
[22:27] display himself to us and then we
[22:30] display that through us back to him all
[22:33] right well here in the church ages we're
[22:35] going to see that he's in the midst of
[22:37] the church age we're going to see that
[22:38] in just a few minutes but he is now a
[22:42] judge and you got to understand that you
[22:44] say no it's Mercy yes it's Mercy but
[22:47] he's a judge he's already judged those
[22:49] other Church ages amen we'll read that
[22:52] in just a little bit so Lord bless you
[22:54] let's start into the church ages we're
[22:55] not going to get into Ephesus right now
[22:58] but let's stay and let's see who this
[23:00] man is that's controlling everything and
[23:03] look what form he's in now he has
[23:05] decided to become into another form all
[23:08] right he decided in the beginning was
[23:09] the word word was with God and that word
[23:11] was made flesh now he has transferred
[23:14] that into us by inor he has imorph
[23:17] himself in a bride and he absolutely
[23:19] right here tells
[23:21] us he's in Bride form right now all
[23:24] right so let's bow our heads Lord we
[23:26] know we got many sick many ones Lord
[23:29] that that are um not here Lord because
[23:31] of sickness we pray that you'd touch
[23:33] their body Lord be with the ones Lord
[23:36] that are sin sick as as brother Donnie
[23:38] said Lord we think of many ones that
[23:39] should be here Lord of our children and
[23:42] family and different ones Lord I pray
[23:43] that youd touch their heart father it's
[23:45] getting late this Gentile dispensation
[23:48] that we're that we're in now is about to
[23:50] be over in Revelations 4:1 John was
[23:54] caught up through an open door and
[23:56] father I believe that we're now into
[23:58] that place to where we're going to be
[23:59] caught up in a Rapture and whatever
[24:01] happens down here is going to be
[24:03] judgment to the Gentile dispensation
[24:06] father just be with us let us not be
[24:09] scared but let us have some urgency that
[24:11] we study more pray more come to church
[24:13] more do the things of the Lord more this
[24:17] year father than ever before father
[24:19] forgive us of our sins and faults and
[24:21] many mistakes Lord we make ask you to
[24:23] bless the bride around the world
[24:25] Lord be with the ones Lord that in
[24:28] places where there's a lot of bad
[24:29] weather Lord I pray that you'd touch
[24:31] them and be with them Lord give us this
[24:33] day our daily bread we come to hear from
[24:34] you father so I pray in Jesus name that
[24:36] that will happen amen Revelations
[24:40] 1:1 will dis still on the son of man
[24:43] because right at the beginning right
[24:45] here at the front boom when John looks
[24:47] over he saws he saw what one lik to the
[24:50] son of man so we're going to carry that
[24:52] into what we've been speaking for 10 and
[24:55] something services but now we're going
[24:57] to put him in the m M all right
[24:58] everybody with me Revelations 1:10 says
[25:01] I was in the spirit on the Lord's day
[25:04] and heard behind me a great voice as of
[25:06] a trumpet now we're going to maybe break
[25:07] a little bit this down a little bit more
[25:09] later on but look at verse 11 saying I
[25:12] am Alpha and Omega now the alpha bride
[25:15] has already been
[25:17] here that was the Beginning Church ages
[25:19] that was the way God wanted his church
[25:21] to start he said I'm Alpha and Omega now
[25:23] in between he was the Holy Ghost and he
[25:25] had Believers and he had bride but what
[25:27] whatever he had in the first he wants it
[25:29] in the last all right us we're in the
[25:33] Omega part all right thereby with me on
[25:36] that I am Alpha and Omega and we'll see
[25:38] in just maybe later on down the road
[25:40] that even the verbiage that John uses
[25:42] shows you that Ephesus and leosa is the
[25:46] two book ends all right we'll see that
[25:48] maybe later on I am Alpha and Omega the
[25:51] first and the last and what thou seest
[25:53] right in the book and send it into the
[25:54] seven churches which are in Asia under
[25:56] Ephesus Smyrna pergamus thyra Sardis
[25:59] Philadelphia and laa and I turned to see
[26:02] the voice now remember
[26:04] John that voice was
[26:07] familiar John had literally heard Jesus
[26:10] for three and a half years speaking all
[26:12] right and John was put on the aisle of
[26:14] pmas to write what he saw all right but
[26:17] he's going to hear something first
[26:19] because Faith cometh by hearing so he
[26:21] had to have faith in what he was hearing
[26:24] so I turned to see the voice that spoke
[26:25] to me and be and being turned I saw
[26:27] seven golden
[26:28] candlesticks and in the midst of the
[26:30] seven candlesticks one like unto the son
[26:32] of man clothed with a garment down to
[26:35] the foot and gir about the paps with a
[26:37] golden girdle his head and his hair were
[26:39] white like wool as white as snow and his
[26:41] eyes were as flames of fire and his feet
[26:43] liking Define brass as if they burned in
[26:45] a furnace and his voice as the sound of
[26:48] many Waters and he had in his right hand
[26:50] Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a
[26:52] sharp two-edged sword and his
[26:54] countenance was as the sun shineth in
[26:56] his strength there seven identifications
[26:58] of this man that we're talking about and
[27:00] we'll break them down this afternoon all
[27:02] right as the sun shineth in its strength
[27:05] all right you may be seting the Lord
[27:06] that His blessings of the word now that
[27:08] word mixed means among or from among and
[27:12] actually it means also the middle all
[27:15] right can everybody see that
[27:16] okay CU if I if I magnify it maybe a
[27:19] little bit more there'll be some um some
[27:23] uh pictures on here that we can uh that
[27:26] we can see so let's
[27:28] let's get us a little bit more up
[27:31] here all right so he's in the midst of
[27:33] the church he's in the midst of these
[27:35] candlesticks now here is the Candlestick
[27:38] that the manora as they call it now
[27:40] watch cuz I'm going to show you another
[27:42] picture I couldn't find one with Jesus
[27:44] in the middle of it but I did find one
[27:46] but the the lamp stands off a little bit
[27:48] it makes them separate listen it's not
[27:50] separate what happened was in the inner
[27:52] Court not the holy of holies in the
[27:54] inner Court there was an artificial
[27:56] light and it was these candles sticks
[27:57] what happened is is there was a little
[27:59] thing down at the bottom at that ve at
[28:01] the bottom of that let me get up here we
[28:03] maybe you can see it all at the bottom
[28:05] of that there was a little place you
[28:06] could open and you poured oil in all
[28:09] right and then the wick ran down into
[28:11] those into those
[28:13] bars all right everybody seen everybody
[28:15] seen a hurricane
[28:18] lamp well I'm sorry you young kids it's
[28:21] not
[28:22] LED it's actually a burning fire we have
[28:26] a couple that we use and it's full of
[28:28] oil and it's got a wick that you turn up
[28:29] and down to make the flame go up or
[28:32] flame go down so that's kind of what
[28:34] that was at the top of that was fire and
[28:37] as you kept pouring the oil in the
[28:39] priest would come in and light those and
[28:41] he listen he lit one off the
[28:45] other that's important because it's the
[28:47] Holy Ghost in every Church age but it's
[28:49] the fire from one Church age that goes
[28:51] to the second Church age from the second
[28:53] Church age to the Third Church age
[28:55] listen they are separate in in do
[29:00] but they're the same with the Holy Ghost
[29:02] it's the Holy Ghost in every Church age
[29:04] it's just that we'll see here in just a
[29:05] few minutes that that light is being
[29:09] divided into seven different ways all
[29:12] right so there's your lamp stand that's
[29:13] the official one that's one that's in
[29:15] the and if you'll look right down here
[29:17] if you can see it there's one right here
[29:18] in this case um which is the just like
[29:21] that but you pour the oil in which is
[29:23] the type of the Holy Ghost and then that
[29:24] Holy Ghost goes into every lampstand all
[29:27] right everybody with me on
[29:28] that now what John saw was pretty close
[29:32] to this right here I don't know if you
[29:34] can see that well it's not too bad I
[29:36] tried to blow it up but you see that he
[29:38] had what hair like wool sword in his
[29:41] mouth stars in his hand his feet was
[29:44] brass but he was in the midst of the
[29:47] church ages and that's why I said I
[29:48] couldn't find one all those should be
[29:50] connected but that's his that's his
[29:52] personage that's who the that's who the
[29:55] uh the church ages are Laing to the son
[29:57] of man G about the paps which means
[30:00] breast all right so that would be a
[30:02] feminist form of Jesus Christ which is
[30:05] the what the bride me and you all right
[30:09] everybody with me on that now I want to
[30:10] show you something here that I looked up
[30:12] and that may be a little bit blurry but
[30:15] we understand about the rainbow colors
[30:18] the the world uses it for for something
[30:23] filthy but God used it for something
[30:26] that said I'll not destroy the Earth
[30:29] with water anymore it was a sign but now
[30:32] what happens and look it's funny that a
[30:34] prism you can't do it with a
[30:38] circle right it has to be a
[30:43] triangular pyramid
[30:46] looking and you can and then reading it
[30:49] online you can take that and you can cut
[30:52] it like this A Million Ways as long as
[30:54] you got a little bit of that glass it
[30:57] will as they say in a minut a big word
[30:59] called refraction but it's important
[31:02] because what God's doing he's standing
[31:04] here one person in the midst of these
[31:06] Church ages but there's a there's a a
[31:09] voice to this age and a voice to this
[31:11] age and a voice to this age and a voice
[31:12] to this age all the way through seven
[31:14] seven different voices coming emanating
[31:17] from one light now the whole thing of
[31:19] this is is this light that goes into
[31:22] this must be
[31:25] white and then as it goes into this
[31:28] pyramid our prism it changes our
[31:33] disperses in different light forms all
[31:39] right what does the prism do the light
[31:42] as light passes now watch as light
[31:44] passes through the prism it's
[31:48] bent in its own unique way right all
[31:52] right everybody with me Bob's Bob laid a
[31:55] lot on y'all about teaching today so
[31:57] we're going to try to understand this
[31:59] thanks a lot
[32:00] buddy lay the pressure would you as like
[32:04] no it just keeps us it keeps us where we
[32:06] study a lot you know study some more so
[32:09] as light passes through now watch as
[32:10] light passes into
[32:13] that it bends or
[32:16] refracts it slows
[32:22] down eternity white light comes to the
[32:26] church ages it goes into seven different
[32:29] and we'll get in we're not get into the
[32:30] brother George Quinn if you want to know
[32:32] about George Quinn about 10 years ago he
[32:34] came here preached about all those seven
[32:36] seven um U colors in the rainbow I will
[32:39] not get into that but it's been a
[32:41] refracted now what refracted is if you
[32:43] put a straw inside of this water
[32:45] remember if you look at it like this it
[32:46] look like it's
[32:47] broke cuz what happens is when the light
[32:50] goes into something an object it bends
[32:53] it can't go straight through it bends
[32:56] and when it bends it slows down and as
[32:58] it slows down it creates
[33:01] color God had to slow down for us amen
[33:05] he was the white light he was the he was
[33:06] the Eternal one but he decided to go
[33:09] through a prism he decided to go through
[33:12] a church age and the angle of light for
[33:15] each age is
[33:17] different so what does a prism do to
[33:19] light as light passes through a prism it
[33:21] is bent or refracted I tried to look up
[33:24] the word refracted in the computer and
[33:26] the uh internet was down it's back up
[33:28] now but what refracted basically is is
[33:30] like I said before something white the
[33:33] light's going like this but when it hits
[33:35] any object it bends right so it refracts
[33:39] or bends just a little bit and then what
[33:42] look by the Angles and plain look it has
[33:44] to be an angle you can shoot it through
[33:47] a flat piece of of glass and you don't
[33:48] get
[33:51] anything it's got to be a shirt in
[33:54] shape can't be round it can't can't even
[33:57] be square as some of us may be
[34:01] but those young ones will understand I
[34:03] mean old ones will understand young ones
[34:05] will not but you see the you see the end
[34:07] of that what it looks like that's what
[34:09] it is it's a triangular glass prism that
[34:12] white light goes into and then the light
[34:14] slows down and and why seven why not 8
[34:18] 10 9 4 three cuz God's perfect he's
[34:22] complete in seven if that white light is
[34:24] him then all that light right there is
[34:27] him being bent or
[34:30] refracted or revelated to his people
[34:34] down here because that's what we see
[34:37] right all right everybody with me so
[34:39] what it does is by the Angles and plain
[34:42] faces of the prism and each wavelength
[34:44] of light is refracted by a slightly
[34:47] different amount every Church age is
[34:49] different by slightly different amount
[34:52] all right everybody with me on that all
[34:55] right
[34:57] upon Passage through the prism the white
[34:59] light it actually says the white light
[35:03] all right the white light is separated
[35:06] into its component colors so inside of
[35:09] that white light come on somebody inside
[35:12] of that white light is those seven
[35:14] colors you can't see them though until
[35:17] he reveals our bends now listen he don't
[35:20] bend the word but he bends himself
[35:23] enough to where he gets down here with
[35:25] us puts up with some of our junk is
[35:27] somebody here today puts up with some of
[35:30] our
[35:31] stuff and says I love you anyway you
[35:33] were part of me before you were part of
[35:35] me when it was white and now you're part
[35:38] of me now that I've divided you into
[35:39] seven different ways I still love you
[35:42] cuz you were in me before the foundation
[35:43] of the world these colors come on
[35:45] somebody these colors were in him before
[35:47] the foundation of the world they just
[35:49] didn't go oh I think I no he had a seven
[35:53] colored prism he had a seven stars in
[35:56] his hand he he had seven Messengers he
[35:58] had seven messages and thank God we're
[36:00] in the last one cuz I'll read to you in
[36:03] just a little bit what happens now let's
[36:05] look at this real quick I was running
[36:07] through this what brother rman said
[36:08] about the allseeing eye for those of you
[36:10] that don't have a dollar bill can you
[36:12] see that or I need to make it a little
[36:13] bit
[36:15] bigger Anna be honest can you see
[36:22] that let's make it just a little bit
[36:24] bigger if you got a dollar bill look
[36:26] look on the back of
[36:28] it but listen this is what America done
[36:31] now think about
[36:33] this the pyramid never had a cap put on
[36:37] it all the pyramids in Egypt one bill
[36:40] nothing it's flat on top how about with
[36:43] me cuz remember the headstone was eject
[36:46] was rejected or ejected was rejected so
[36:50] there shouldn't be that up
[36:53] there but you got to have your white
[36:55] light you got to have that all SE eye
[36:57] that's looking down through the church
[36:58] ages praise the Lord and he's glowing
[37:02] looking down he's an
[37:06] eye why do you think we need isav in
[37:09] this end
[37:11] time all right why do we need isav
[37:16] H because of that right there because
[37:18] look in this use the I representing the
[37:21] allseeing eye of God serves as a
[37:25] reminder
[37:27] that Humanity's thoughts and deeds are
[37:30] always observed by
[37:32] God now there whoever wrote this didn't
[37:36] continue on as brother brandham did he
[37:38] said so that the world so he's looking
[37:40] at the why would the United States he
[37:42] said that's why she's going to be judged
[37:43] more than any other place they are
[37:45] saying that is the Seal of God they're
[37:48] saying that's the allseeing eye of God
[37:50] watching what they're doing as a nation
[37:52] come on he's going to destroy this place
[37:54] if he sees this nation and what we've
[37:56] come
[37:58] now he's got to destroy it but that
[38:02] allseeing eye that's why they why they
[38:04] put it on the back of a dollar
[38:06] bill why God made them put it on there
[38:09] right right God will make you whether
[38:12] you like it or not he'll make you
[38:14] testify what age you're living in he'll
[38:16] make you testify as where the Bible
[38:18] saying whether you're a Christian or not
[38:20] or whether you got the gift of God or
[38:22] not heal it's got to come out like I
[38:24] said before all last year let it out now
[38:26] it's going to manifest
[38:28] itself all
[38:29] right so it's the Eye of Providence or
[38:33] Divine Providence is all seeing eye
[38:35] brother brand and Daniel 70 weeks so now
[38:38] because they're in shape see where I've
[38:40] got this shaped up here like a pyramid
[38:42] the arising of the Saints makes the
[38:44] March into Glory you understand it now
[38:47] Christ The Headstone the rejected Stone
[38:49] that's what we've been talking about and
[38:50] that's what we're into now we're into
[38:52] the headstone talking about the church
[38:54] but you got to look him in the headstone
[38:55] though he's looking looking down on his
[38:57] church the white light is now looking
[38:59] down and he's divided himself into
[39:01] seven Church ages seven manifestations
[39:05] seven men one to each Church age all
[39:08] right so we're not looking for another
[39:11] messenger it's the holy ghost pulling up
[39:13] through that oil that oil pulling up
[39:15] through our
[39:18] Candlestick Christ The Headstone the
[39:20] rejected Stone the allseeing eye coming
[39:22] exactly like the Bible said and Daniel
[39:25] said he watched this Gentile age this is
[39:28] kind of why I'm bringing it cuz listen
[39:30] the Gentile age started on the day of
[39:32] Pentecost the the alpha bride it's going
[39:36] to end in the Omega bride and it will
[39:38] end the Gentile dispensation will end
[39:41] when that stone came out of the mountain
[39:43] that wasn't cut with hands they had
[39:45] never put a Capstone on that pyramid it
[39:47] wasn't cut by man's hands that's why
[39:50] this is not a man this is not a man's
[39:52] religion this is not a man's message
[39:54] except the man the white light it's the
[39:58] white light man's message all right you
[40:01] see it and what did it do it hit the
[40:03] image right smacking the feet if you
[40:05] want to knock somebody over do what hit
[40:06] them in the feet and broke it to Pieces
[40:09] grounded into powder hallelujah what
[40:11] happened at that time the coming of that
[40:13] stone up went the church into Glory at
[40:16] the Rapture cause it ended the Gentile
[40:19] dispensation why did they put it on the
[40:21] dollar bill because it's ending the
[40:23] Gentile dispensation and we're part of
[40:25] it
[40:26] and our own money declares it our own
[40:31] government I'd like to talk to whoever
[40:33] that was that put that on there course I
[40:35] mean they're passed on now but and ask
[40:38] why why' you put that instead of a you
[40:40] know because they got a eagle in one and
[40:41] they got all these things held up with
[40:43] the different things but they put a
[40:45] pyramid with an allseeing eye up went
[40:48] the church into Glory at the Rapture
[40:49] because it ended the Gentile
[40:51] dispensation God ended it up the coming
[40:54] of that stone and that's what we're in
[40:55] today we're into the coming of The
[40:57] Headstone all right The Headstone back
[40:59] to the church to unite the head and body
[41:02] if you'll look at that picture there's
[41:03] still a gap between the
[41:05] two there's an interval there's an
[41:08] intermission there's something in
[41:09] between that that's got to be filled
[41:12] up that is where your seals
[41:17] are there he is Christ is that stone cuz
[41:20] look the headstones already took a body
[41:22] change the ones underneath have not
[41:25] right right
[41:29] there he is Christ is that stone he
[41:32] wasn't born of a man he was born of God
[41:34] he's coming for a church that's been
[41:35] reborn Again by the spirit of God
[41:38] because the strength of that headstone
[41:40] look the strength of that headstone runs
[41:41] all through the church like a
[41:44] magnet and we saw those white
[41:46] lights
[41:48] refracting down upon us into seven
[41:50] different colors so now the future home
[41:52] brother B talks about this now I don't
[41:55] have my pocketbook with with me but if
[41:56] you'll notice he did not carry
[41:58] pocketbook it used to be called a
[41:59] pocketbook it's a billfold all right so
[42:01] some the young people are going did he
[42:02] PR a pocketbook no your pocketbook with
[42:05] your BFF hoo all
[42:07] right like saying boot or trunk and
[42:11] glove compartment or
[42:14] dashboard brother in Connecticut's going
[42:17] what in the world are they talking about
[42:20] I don't have my billfold with me but if
[42:22] you'll notice in your billfold if you
[42:24] have a dollar bill they have the SE of
[42:26] the United States an eagle on one end
[42:28] holding the spears the coat of arms as
[42:30] it were and the other end has got the
[42:32] pyramid with an allseeing eye on top of
[42:35] it see they don't know what they were
[42:38] doing and on there is wrote in Latin and
[42:41] you'll find out it says this is the
[42:43] Great Seal they didn't know what they
[42:46] were doing neither did Kus know he was
[42:50] prophesying brother Bown illustrates is
[42:52] there's the Great Seal here it is see
[42:53] the city he's talking about the future
[42:56] home home so what's he saying listen the
[42:58] future home is going to be what a
[42:59] pyramid shaped City and then he's going
[43:02] to sit down on top of it and be the
[43:04] light and and who is really the light of
[43:06] the city it's not just coming from one
[43:08] man it's coming from the bride we like
[43:11] the city right we're Lights of the world
[43:14] is that not right but when we get over
[43:16] there it's not going to be any kind of
[43:17] Shadow there's not going to be a
[43:22] Monday it's not just a flat Cube like
[43:25] this see it's got to refract so it's got
[43:28] to have an angle to
[43:30] it got to have an angle to refract his
[43:33] light or to bended enough to have seven
[43:36] different Church ages all right not
[43:39] seven different ideas right no that's
[43:43] happened before there's seven seven
[43:45] different ideas in the in the
[43:47] message much less down Through the Ages
[43:49] but it's not it's what the personage of
[43:51] God being shown into each Church age
[43:54] because remember the picture that was a
[43:56] sharp two-edged sword came where out of
[43:58] his mouth but he was in Bride form right
[44:00] we'll see all this afternoon you'll see
[44:02] all this and you'll think man judgment
[44:04] is over that's why a lot of people
[44:05] thinks judgment is over and and we're in
[44:07] a millennium and all we don't have to do
[44:08] this you don't have to do that listen if
[44:10] you have a doctrine that takes stuff out
[44:12] of the
[44:14] Bible and you can't accept all of it I
[44:16] think Revelations 20 or somewhere in
[44:18] there says your name would be taken out
[44:20] of the book if you took something out of
[44:22] the Bible we're not beyond anything
[44:28] right just put that in there for a
[44:31] minute so it's not something new it's
[44:34] not new
[44:35] doctrine it's just more revelation of
[44:37] the same one aren't we going to get more
[44:39] Revelation even when we get over there
[44:42] we're going to get more revelation of
[44:43] what went on and all the things that
[44:44] happened and we'll understand we'll
[44:47] understand it better by and
[44:50] by but it leans up so that it can be
[44:53] seen now he's talking about the city
[44:54] upon this Holy Mountain of the Lord Lord
[44:56] the Lord shall descend upon top of his
[44:58] Mountain here he is that's the reason
[45:00] the Capstone wasn't put on by Enoch
[45:02] that's the reason the Capstone has to
[45:04] come now and the mountain will be pushed
[45:06] up and it'll be the Mountain of God and
[45:08] who's going to live there just the
[45:11] bride everything else will live outside
[45:14] the city in this great big world but the
[45:16] bride will live inside that City and we
[45:18] will be the light thereof that says the
[45:20] Bible the lamb but who are we by the
[45:23] spirit of God today we're the Lamb of
[45:25] God
[45:27] God that too much no it ain't enough
[45:31] right even Jesus stood one day and said
[45:33] whoever sins you retain they're retain
[45:35] whoever sins you forgive they're
[45:36] forgiven who is he talking about he was
[45:39] talking about Peter talking about the
[45:41] disciples but it was Christ in them
[45:43] because they couldn't do it by theel
[45:45] that's
[45:46] right so Blasphemous names we've been
[45:48] reading this quote where brother around
[45:50] SS the church is a mystical Body of
[45:52] Christ and we we kind of showed where
[45:54] the church and the bride was cuz we know
[45:56] the church in the bride is
[45:58] different the mystical Body of Christ
[46:00] born of the Breath of God did you get it
[46:03] the Church of God is born of the Breath
[46:05] of God God breathed breath into the
[46:06] nostrils spiritually of Adam and he
[46:08] became a living Soul did you know the
[46:10] Pentecostals are the true Pentecostal
[46:12] church now he's talking about the alpha
[46:14] church is born by the Breath of God Amen
[46:17] we see licks of fire and different ones
[46:19] but it was God had already breathed on
[46:21] them and God breathed on them and went
[46:23] in them to make them Sons and Daughters
[46:25] of
[46:26] god so let's read this just for a moment
[46:28] and then we'll get into
[46:30] the into the thought but watch what
[46:32] brother B says he talks about look each
[46:34] age has had its message and its
[46:36] messenger cuz I want you to get
[46:38] established there is a message there is
[46:41] a messenger there is a
[46:45] rebuke there's a spiritual war
[46:49] starts we'll read that in just a
[46:52] minute cuz what's combating us now it's
[46:55] the anti Christ but remember in the end
[46:58] time though that battle is going to be
[47:00] so close till it's almost going to
[47:01] deceive the very elect that we were
[47:02] talking about Jesus in Matthew
[47:04] 24:24 that the two Spirits would come so
[47:07] close and brother Ram talks about the
[47:08] two spirits in the framework of the
[47:14] church one's going to make it lukewarm
[47:16] cold and Powerless one's going to make
[47:19] it
[47:20] powerful and nobody's going to stop it
[47:24] it will happen through and in somebody
[47:26] called the bride all right all through
[47:29] the times every age has packed its
[47:31] message with a messenger our refracted
[47:34] the light of God not changed it but ref
[47:37] reflected or refracted what's already
[47:40] the white light
[47:41] showing in every dispensation has sent
[47:44] forth someone Anointed with the Holy
[47:46] Spirit to bring forth his message for
[47:49] that age every time all right let's read
[47:52] this right
[47:54] here God's gifts find his place notice
[47:56] I've said God he divided his word now
[47:58] look he divided his word at the
[48:00] beginning so he doesn't have a problem
[48:02] talking about
[48:03] refraction God divided his word but
[48:06] listen if it's God's word and he divides
[48:09] it it's God's word if we take God's word
[48:12] and divide it it's our
[48:14] plan right or it's anti anything
[48:18] contrary to God is anti all right
[48:22] brother man says I can take Genesis and
[48:23] show you every age in the Bible we might
[48:25] do that cuz I the Lord I believe opened
[48:28] up
[48:29] something years ago about there is seven
[48:31] Church ages in the Old Testament cuz you
[48:34] got your you got your mirror image and
[48:36] we'll talk about maybe a little bit
[48:38] later it doesn't mean anything to us but
[48:40] it just shows the continuity of God he
[48:41] was in the Old Testament now he might
[48:43] not have been in the people but he was
[48:44] right there dividing and keeping the
[48:46] people he always separate when did
[48:48] Israel get in
[48:49] trouble when they started mingling with
[48:53] the Earth with the
[48:54] world they started mingling he said
[48:56] separate
[48:58] divide come up here with Moses I'm going
[49:00] to destroy them people thank God there
[49:03] was a Moses but but Moses could only do
[49:05] it so much cuz when Dayan and cor did
[49:09] that Moses could have said whatever he
[49:11] wanted to those people had rejected the
[49:13] word and they died all right the ground
[49:16] opened up
[49:18] and wow what a what a great God I can
[49:22] take Genesis and show you every age in
[49:24] the Bible down to this age here all the
[49:25] Cults and things we have today I can
[49:27] show you exactly where they was in
[49:30] Genesis now I want you to realize and
[49:32] and understand that brother randam he's
[49:34] he's getting ready to go through the
[49:35] church
[49:36] ages to show each age but now remember
[49:38] when he first got started he didn't know
[49:41] every Church age messenger he's the only
[49:43] one that God delivered that to him
[49:45] because it just says to the angel of the
[49:46] Church of Ephesus Angel of the Church of
[49:48] Smyrna Angel the church thara and even
[49:51] brother brandham was studying we'll get
[49:53] to it in the second
[49:56] second Church age he was leaning toward
[49:59] polycart because polycart was a great
[50:01] man great individual he had done great
[50:03] things but he had one thing against him
[50:05] that the Holy Spirit brought to brother
[50:07] bram's
[50:09] attention brother Bram said he leaned
[50:12] too much to
[50:13] denomination so he chose irenius the
[50:16] Holy Spirit chose irenius and then
[50:18] showed brother Brenham and and showed
[50:20] him that that was the right refraction
[50:22] or the right light now listen polyart
[50:24] wasn't lost
[50:26] right he's a great man he was absolutely
[50:28] they said that when they burned him at
[50:30] the steak that at one moment the fire
[50:32] came away from him then when the fire
[50:34] came in they said it just like an angel
[50:36] just like something lifted up out of the
[50:38] out of the uhu out of the Flames so God
[50:40] takes care of his
[50:42] own God gave his word so much here and
[50:44] so much here so much here for each age
[50:47] and then he sent a prophet down anointed
[50:49] to make that word come to pass and it
[50:51] supports the other one now look it
[50:53] supports the other one that was
[50:57] coming they're not different it supports
[51:00] the other
[51:03] one and see like the Messiah always
[51:06] supported every prophet in his own life
[51:09] his own being the word that was given
[51:11] for that day are the refraction or the
[51:13] bending of the light and foretold what
[51:17] the other one was going to
[51:19] be now see i' never seen that
[51:23] before but you got to have a platform
[51:25] for the next person to stand on that's
[51:28] why we'll talk about later on about the
[51:30] overlap or the or the message between
[51:32] the ages there's an overlap that
[51:35] overlaps the church ages it's not just
[51:37] an Abrupt end that Wesley died and
[51:39] everything died with him no Wesley
[51:41] passed on and the messages keep going
[51:44] then then you got the Pentecostals come
[51:45] in at a lap over and they're bringing it
[51:47] up then you got each one are lapping
[51:49] over God doesn't have a time when he's
[51:52] not in all the ages he's got bride in
[51:55] every Church age but they lap over and
[51:58] as we've many times before and we'll get
[52:00] into it in the L toy in church age I
[52:01] believe that's what brother Bram a lot
[52:02] of people that were he was preaching to
[52:05] were not message
[52:07] Believers oh don't get quiet on me they
[52:10] weren't message Believers there wasn't a
[52:12] message Church started till later on in
[52:14] the late 60s all the other ones went
[52:17] back to their denominations cuz they saw
[52:20] they got they got
[52:23] Blinded by the Light that's right amen
[52:27] they didn't see the refraction for their
[52:29] age they didn't see the color for their
[52:32] age but yet they were part of it okay
[52:35] they don't we're not kicking anybody out
[52:38] God's the only one that does that all
[52:41] right oh by the way thank you
[52:44] Hudson see that thing he's holding up
[52:46] back there that's a a fan I think Sister
[52:49] Charlotte brought a bunch of them up
[52:50] here and and uh I like palm trees palm
[52:54] tree leaves so we'll just just if y'all
[52:56] get sleepy this will really help you cuz
[52:57] you know if you fall asleep you might
[52:58] throw it to your neighbor and hit them
[53:00] in the head or something you know so
[53:02] we'll sharpen the ends of
[53:05] them then we'll pray for the
[53:08] sick get you laugh a little bit cuz you
[53:11] fallone sleep already look and every one
[53:14] of them spoke of that white light so you
[53:16] can't take anything
[53:19] away from the white light which is God
[53:22] all right can't can't can't take it away
[53:24] from anything from the pure word of God
[53:26] cuz he was the fullness he was the head
[53:28] of the prophets in other words the
[53:29] allseeing eye he was the word of God he
[53:32] was the prophets he was the word of God
[53:34] he was the prophets there he is how
[53:37] wonderful what he was each one of those
[53:39] prophets now listen we'll continue on
[53:41] identification of Christ 1964 this is
[53:44] after the after the seals open actually
[53:46] in the church ages now we find out that
[53:49] he in the beginning God look God lotted
[53:51] so much word for each age listen the
[53:53] alpha bride had so much word
[53:56] then what happened in the other ages in
[54:00] between all that man got
[54:03] involved brought their own idea and it
[54:05] weakened the church it didn't destroy
[54:07] the church it weakened
[54:09] her but he still the the light still
[54:11] refracted but God didn't refract his
[54:14] light on a father son Holy Ghost baptism
[54:16] that's right he allowed that to happen
[54:19] because man had just got into such a
[54:21] scruple like brother Brandon on marriage
[54:23] and divorce don't go by leave
[54:26] when you say marriage and divorce people
[54:27] getting real nervous nobody leave but he
[54:30] want had the marriage and divorce he
[54:31] said what's the problem what's the
[54:33] problem with why we're sitting right
[54:35] where we're sitting
[54:36] today he said
[54:39] misinterpreted
[54:41] theology coming from the pull pit saying
[54:45] it's okay to do that come as you are I
[54:48] believe in coming as you are but I don't
[54:51] believe in leaving as you
[54:52] were I don't believe in living like that
[54:55] on down the
[54:57] road come as you are no doubt you got to
[54:59] get into you got to get into water
[55:01] somehow but that water should what clean
[55:05] you praise the Lord don't miss this when
[55:08] it comes time for that word to be
[55:10] revealed talking about each Church age I
[55:12] want to see how listen this thing is
[55:14] separated but it's all together it's all
[55:17] together the body of Christ but it's
[55:18] been separated
[55:20] into this church age here the first
[55:22] church age they were powerful God God
[55:25] Jesus had just left the scene they had
[55:28] Paul Peter and all these great Apostles
[55:31] they had the foundation of the word of
[55:32] God they had these virtues working in
[55:35] their
[55:37] church but what happened was this man
[55:40] got
[55:42] involved at sthus right at the first you
[55:44] know he says oh Jesus was a light
[55:46] substance of God so see that just we'll
[55:50] get to it in a little bit as as brother
[55:51] Bob was alluding to the nician spirit it
[55:53] starts as a what SA
[55:56] well do you think I don't think what do
[55:58] you think God don't care what you
[56:01] think remember I told you you get in
[56:03] real big trouble when you start a word
[56:05] of of a sentence with me saying I
[56:08] thought we're going downhill from then
[56:10] on all
[56:12] right and then as the word becomes time
[56:15] look time for it to be revealed in other
[56:18] words the light's coming in it's already
[56:21] refracted in one age and it's going to
[56:22] be just and listen it says slightly
[56:26] slightly into another church age don't
[56:29] miss this when it comes time for that
[56:30] word to be revealed usually man had it
[56:33] so messed up till he appeared to a
[56:37] prophet and we'll get into that just in
[56:38] a few minutes and see where brother
[56:39] Brown in the first seal clears every bit
[56:42] of this up and shows exactly how God
[56:44] moves in the church ages praise God for
[56:46] the open of the seals I think he says
[56:49] that too search the scriptures see now
[56:51] remember the unchanging God the
[56:53] unchanging white light
[56:56] he cannot change his ways he must every
[57:00] time do it the same
[57:03] unchanging listen he did it the same
[57:06] man's the one that took and refracted it
[57:09] or or bent the word of God to fit what
[57:11] their Doctrine to fit their
[57:15] time why they say you know they say well
[57:18] y'all just y'all just live in the Old
[57:20] Testament or you you you just you know
[57:22] you look like back in under somewhere
[57:24] you know I remember when Grandma used to
[57:26] well what
[57:28] changed what changed I tell somebody in
[57:31] the family the other day we were talking
[57:32] about granny granny Dale she's she died
[57:35] in
[57:36] 19 87 or 88 but I never see her I never
[57:39] saw her wear a pair of pants and she was
[57:41] a
[57:42] Baptist long hair I mean who took that
[57:46] out man took it
[57:50] out living the word of God man took it
[57:53] out and what did God do I'll tell you
[57:56] what he done here in just a few
[57:57] minutes and seven Church agents that set
[58:00] forth in Revelation now look chapter one
[58:02] is showing as brother R calls it his
[58:05] personage it's showing who this guy is
[58:08] but it's also showing where he
[58:11] is he's in those seven Gentile Church
[58:14] ages in a bride bride
[58:17] form all right so in Revelation chap 2
[58:20] and 3 Tak in the whole span of the
[58:22] fullness of the Gentiles cuzz remember
[58:24] Revelations 41 does what John top of the
[58:27] Bride gets caught up right in a
[58:31] Rapture are the whole time in when which
[58:34] God is dealing with the Gentiles unto
[58:39] salvation in every single age Bar None
[58:42] it says the very same thing in opening
[58:44] and closing the message to each age
[58:47] until the messenger of and he list them
[58:49] these things saith he etc etc he that
[58:52] hath an ear let him singular hear what
[58:55] the spirit sayith to the churches notice
[58:57] here that Jesus by the spirit in every
[58:59] age addresses himself to only one
[59:04] person relative to the word for that
[59:08] age they're the color or the refraction
[59:11] they catch the word of God they catch
[59:13] the Revelation for their
[59:15] hour then they bring their message we'll
[59:17] talk about that in just a second only
[59:20] one messenger for each
[59:23] age now ask you a question brother BR
[59:27] never denied D Moody all he he he list
[59:30] all these great people right Clarence
[59:33] Lin all the he he names them right he
[59:37] said he said Dwight Moody put millions
[59:40] in in the kingdom of God was he a church
[59:42] change messenger
[59:44] no he didn't have the light for his day
[59:47] he had part he come in under the light
[59:49] he actually came in under Wesley's
[59:52] light in the late 18 1900s early
[59:56] 1900s but only one messenger for each
[59:58] age and you talking about Charles
[1:00:00] Spurgeon and all these different ones
[1:00:02] Smith
[1:00:03] Wigglesworth read about that man he
[1:00:06] wasn't a prophet messenger he didn't
[1:00:08] have the light for the day but he told a
[1:00:11] guy that had one leg he one leg sure he
[1:00:13] didn't have a foot he told him to go buy
[1:00:15] him a pair of shoes right uh do you hear
[1:00:18] what I said a pair of shoes and when he
[1:00:21] got in the shoe store he believed that
[1:00:22] man so much
[1:00:25] but when they went to get his shoes when
[1:00:27] come back there was a foot
[1:00:28] there now praise
[1:00:31] God but he wasn't a messenger because he
[1:00:33] didn't receive the message it was made
[1:00:36] for one man William brandham one man
[1:00:38] John Wesley Martin Luther Columba all
[1:00:41] the way down the
[1:00:42] line and that one messenger is the
[1:00:45] messenger to the look to the true
[1:00:48] church he speaks for god wow by
[1:00:53] Revelation to the church you know why
[1:00:55] cuz he catches that white light which is
[1:00:57] eternal God he catches the thought of
[1:00:59] God brother R said let's go back into
[1:01:01] the what back part of the mind of God
[1:01:02] nobody's ever said that
[1:01:04] before the message is then broadcast to
[1:01:07] all but though it is broadcast for all
[1:01:10] who come within range of the message
[1:01:12] that message is received
[1:01:15] individually by only a certain qualified
[1:01:18] group in a certain
[1:01:21] way each individual of that group
[1:01:25] is one who has the ability to hear what
[1:01:28] the spirit is saying by way of the
[1:01:30] messenger people want to try to do away
[1:01:32] with brother brandom well find me a
[1:01:34] messenger find me somebody I need number
[1:01:36] seven I need that seven star I need I'm
[1:01:39] in lay out of SE that's for real I need
[1:01:42] that messenger if brother R's not yet
[1:01:44] God got to send it to me but I believe
[1:01:46] he already
[1:01:47] did N is a group getting their
[1:01:49] Collective Revelation watch this but
[1:01:52] each person is hearing and receiving
[1:01:55] what the messenger has already received
[1:01:58] from
[1:02:00] God now this will explain it all right
[1:02:03] here in the first seal brother Brown
[1:02:05] says look says now
[1:02:08] notice but it's to be revealed when the
[1:02:10] lamb leaves his intercessory place from
[1:02:13] the father now that's Revelations 5 now
[1:02:16] he takes the book of seals the book of
[1:02:18] seals or a book sealed with seals
[1:02:22] everybody with me amen the book was was
[1:02:24] a scroll remember it wasn't the Bible it
[1:02:26] was a scroll and it had tabs on it it
[1:02:28] sealed up what was inside each one had
[1:02:30] seal right breaks them and shows them
[1:02:36] look at the End of the Age now after the
[1:02:40] intercessory is
[1:02:41] over the church age has done finished up
[1:02:45] he come in the first age the Ephesian
[1:02:47] age revealed sent a messenger notice
[1:02:50] what happened as we go along now here is
[1:02:52] the plan of it now this this is
[1:02:55] explained the best I've ever
[1:02:57] heard I hope brother Brown said it
[1:03:01] here's the plan of it now as we go
[1:03:02] through the church ages you keep this in
[1:03:03] your mind the first thing happens
[1:03:06] there's an announcement in heaven
[1:03:11] first what happened a seal is
[1:03:15] open right we'll talk about that in a
[1:03:18] little while what is that a mystery is
[1:03:22] unfolded Paul was the mystery of Christ
[1:03:25] revealed for his age right brother
[1:03:28] brandham was the mystery of Christ
[1:03:30] revealed for the age but then there was
[1:03:32] a there was an announcement in
[1:03:33] Revelations 10 that in the days of the
[1:03:36] voice we would catch it all right
[1:03:39] everybody with me on that we would catch
[1:03:41] it he didn't take it with him he gave it
[1:03:43] it went through the Airways it broke the
[1:03:44] airwaves we break it every Sunday and
[1:03:47] every Wednesday we break the Airways
[1:03:49] with the what the voice of
[1:03:50] God are you listening to it or not
[1:03:54] so now listen we F to go through the
[1:03:56] church ages I want to tell you something
[1:03:58] we talk about church ages you look at
[1:03:59] yourself now Paul irenius Martin and
[1:04:02] different ones they were human
[1:04:04] beings Paul had
[1:04:08] issues the things I would I would not
[1:04:10] the things I do I shouldn't do he wasn't
[1:04:13] sinning like that but he wasn't doing
[1:04:15] right 100% he'll tell you he didn't look
[1:04:19] at each one of them each one had a
[1:04:23] flaw something quirky that you know but
[1:04:27] you know what that didn't stop God he
[1:04:29] picked that age that messenger for that
[1:04:32] age so he picked Paul Paul for that age
[1:04:35] but now Paul he had to go about
[1:04:37] preaching irenius was was married the
[1:04:40] different ones you you know what I'm
[1:04:41] talking about you and I we're like we
[1:04:43] hold them up like this and we think man
[1:04:45] they were all perfect no they were human
[1:04:47] you just didn't get all their
[1:04:50] life I promise you if you started
[1:04:53] tomorrow that's enough to begin with
[1:04:56] right there you start tomorrow and write
[1:04:57] down everything you did and record
[1:04:59] everything you did through the week I
[1:05:01] said
[1:05:04] everything let's see what it sounds like
[1:05:06] on next
[1:05:08] Sunday so we all got
[1:05:11] issues brother Brown said he had
[1:05:18] complexes so when we but what I'm saying
[1:05:20] is when we look at this we got to see
[1:05:22] Christ in the messenger preaching the
[1:05:24] message and then it
[1:05:27] affecting the the
[1:05:29] bride affecting her all
[1:05:33] right and you know it does affect you in
[1:05:35] your personal life because I hope when I
[1:05:38] hear all these all these um uh y'all
[1:05:41] going to do that right start recording
[1:05:43] yourself tomorrow morning and bring it
[1:05:45] Sunday we'll go through some of them
[1:05:46] we'll edit some of it
[1:05:49] out but I hope somebody didn't go to a
[1:05:51] bar didn't go to a you understand what I
[1:05:53] mean so that way it has affected us
[1:05:55] where we don't do that but we're still
[1:05:57] humans right and we do human things we
[1:06:00] make human
[1:06:01] mistakes but a mystery is unfolded now
[1:06:04] how's it unfolded it's got to be
[1:06:06] somebody to speak it and there's got to
[1:06:08] be somebody to hear it Faith cometh by
[1:06:13] hearing hear what the spirit says to the
[1:06:16] church right two one listen twice as
[1:06:21] much as you
[1:06:23] talk I'll get
[1:06:27] there and I hear Giggles Rippling all
[1:06:30] the way back to the back see I told you
[1:06:33] I'm I have flaws hello so now look what
[1:06:37] brother Brian says look when a mystery
[1:06:38] unfolds now listen what is a mystery
[1:06:41] it's something previously hid but it's
[1:06:45] there uh those lights are there in that
[1:06:49] white light it just takes God to slow
[1:06:51] down a little
[1:06:53] bit and and get into a messenger slow
[1:06:55] down a little bit get into a messenger
[1:06:57] and then that light bends it doesn't it
[1:06:59] doesn't break it bends and gives Paul a
[1:07:03] message to the
[1:07:05] church but there's somebody there listen
[1:07:09] we see
[1:07:10] rainbows we see light if we didn't have
[1:07:13] any
[1:07:14] eyes that's why the end of the church
[1:07:16] agent says
[1:07:18] isaf use
[1:07:21] isaf brother R talks about Gree
[1:07:24] who talks about
[1:07:26] gree
[1:07:28] Isa and when a mystery listen a prophet
[1:07:31] is is the word for his day so he lives
[1:07:33] to the whole thing now he's got flaws
[1:07:36] he's got a family he's got all these
[1:07:37] different things but he is the message
[1:07:39] so he becomes that part of the word
[1:07:41] brother Bram was identified with Malachi
[1:07:44] 4 Revelations 10 Luke 17:30 all those
[1:07:47] different ones he identified with that
[1:07:49] and he lived
[1:07:51] it so now what we got to do is catch
[1:07:53] that same mystery and live
[1:07:57] it and when a mystery unfolds look a
[1:08:00] trumpet sound so to unfold a mystery
[1:08:03] somebody's got to hear it like I said
[1:08:04] before they might be those seven um
[1:08:08] Indigo readed and all those different
[1:08:09] ones but unless you see it there nothing
[1:08:12] nothing there so unless somebody sees
[1:08:15] the light for the
[1:08:16] day unless somebody sees the light for
[1:08:19] the day and becomes that light they're
[1:08:21] Blinded by the Light
[1:08:24] yeah all right now look when a mystery
[1:08:27] unfolds God has these great Mysteries
[1:08:29] he's getting ready to unfold them he's
[1:08:31] going to unfold them through seven
[1:08:32] Church AE
[1:08:34] Messengers all right and then there's
[1:08:36] going to be seven groups that receive
[1:08:38] it and when a mystery unfolds a trumpet
[1:08:42] sounds a
[1:08:44] message and we hear it now watch what he
[1:08:47] says it declares a
[1:08:51] war that's why we're going to see his
[1:08:53] seven full personage this afternoon if
[1:08:57] it declares a war there got to be
[1:08:59] somebody to fight it right and who's the
[1:09:02] captain to the host he's already
[1:09:04] identified himself as that and when a
[1:09:06] mystery unfolds a trumpet sounds it
[1:09:08] declares a war what did you do when you
[1:09:11] got born again when you got born again
[1:09:12] you may have been out in another church
[1:09:13] not I'm not talking about a m Church you
[1:09:14] might have been in the Baptist or the
[1:09:15] Methodist or the Pentecostal but when
[1:09:17] you heard the voice of this
[1:09:20] messenger come on somebody you're
[1:09:22] sitting here today for a purpose you're
[1:09:25] sitting here today because you heard
[1:09:26] something different than your neighbor
[1:09:28] heard you heard something different than
[1:09:30] your family heard maybe sometime you
[1:09:32] heard the voice of God for your
[1:09:35] day and now you're producing whatever
[1:09:37] light that is and there is something to
[1:09:40] that because indigo is the beginning and
[1:09:44] I think red has the weakest signal but
[1:09:46] we'll talk about that maybe later on
[1:09:47] because each one of them when the light
[1:09:48] bends it changes it just a little bit to
[1:09:50] make the different colors so as it bends
[1:09:52] it slows down
[1:09:55] we'll talk about that in a little bit
[1:09:57] not today we're about done now we get
[1:09:59] out of here and go eat
[1:10:00] something get real full for this
[1:10:03] afternoon and when a mystery unfolds the
[1:10:06] trumpet sounds it declares
[1:10:08] war listen you you yeah you come into
[1:10:12] the
[1:10:13] message and it was just so
[1:10:16] perfect I Comm in and everything's fine
[1:10:19] everybody loves me my family just opens
[1:10:23] arms they say come on
[1:10:24] in no they don't it declares a
[1:10:29] war cuz there's only two people fighting
[1:10:32] that's the devil and
[1:10:33] God and when he gets inside of you he's
[1:10:38] fighting so there's a war declared now
[1:10:41] when brother Bram came on the scene we
[1:10:43] saw all the wars he was born during
[1:10:46] World War I he was here during World War
[1:10:48] II and right after World War II in 1947
[1:10:51] he got his Commission
[1:10:54] right then you had the Korean War and he
[1:10:56] was in part of the the the most wars
[1:10:59] that a prophet had been here he was in
[1:11:01] them he wasn't in them he was here
[1:11:03] during that time there was a war
[1:11:05] declared and fighting began why does a
[1:11:08] war happen in the natural two opposing
[1:11:11] forces one has this idea one has this
[1:11:14] idea everybody with me same thing with
[1:11:17] you when you get your side or the Lord's
[1:11:19] Side there's always opposition yeah
[1:11:22] you'll be hated by your family even
[1:11:24] Jesus said he said father and mother
[1:11:26] sister and brother you know they're not
[1:11:28] going to understand
[1:11:30] you and they
[1:11:36] don't why do you'all do that church
[1:11:38] thing all the time what one guy asked me
[1:11:41] and cusses and prays at the
[1:11:44] next meal but why do y'all do that
[1:11:47] church thing I said well that's what the
[1:11:48] Bible said to do if you didn't see it in
[1:11:51] the Bible then you need to open your
[1:11:52] eyes
[1:11:54] right amen what you here today for You
[1:11:58] Had Your Eyes Open you got the eyes have
[1:12:01] out you read the scripture where it says
[1:12:02] as the day approaches you need to come
[1:12:04] to church
[1:12:06] more problem is is we don't have a
[1:12:08] revelation that it's getting close to
[1:12:11] the
[1:12:13] end or you'd be here more and
[1:12:16] more look it declares a war though look
[1:12:19] or a plague Falls right and a church age
[1:12:25] opened a a light comes
[1:12:29] forth a a different color light than was
[1:12:32] before but it supports the light before
[1:12:35] because it comes from One Source the
[1:12:37] white light but it come through a prism
[1:12:39] it come through the headstone that's why
[1:12:40] the headstone was rejected he became the
[1:12:42] chief what Chief Cornerstone that
[1:12:44] Through the Ages that light could shine
[1:12:46] through that and refract hisself in all
[1:12:49] these Church ages then what's going to
[1:12:51] happen though see we get the headstone
[1:12:53] he's up here pulling us
[1:12:56] up here there's a push up there there's
[1:12:59] a pull that's why it's the third pull
[1:13:01] it's pulling us up into the headstone
[1:13:06] amen or plague Falls and a church age
[1:13:09] open see what is the war part the angel
[1:13:13] of the church now watch catches the
[1:13:15] mystery of God
[1:13:18] right not f look not fully yet revealed
[1:13:21] brother R didn't know what the seals
[1:13:23] were
[1:13:24] come on he didn't know every Church a
[1:13:26] messenger in
[1:13:29] 1947 but he kept he kept going he kept
[1:13:33] catching staying in the mind of God
[1:13:35] staying in the mind of God and then God
[1:13:38] would say study this or have you ever
[1:13:41] looked at this take this right
[1:13:45] here the angel of the church catches the
[1:13:48] mystery of God what am I saying well you
[1:13:50] know you just don't have a church anged
[1:13:52] messenger and all of a sudden he's he's
[1:13:53] uh you know he's working at wherever and
[1:13:55] and all of a sudden it just God dumps on
[1:13:58] him and he runs out and starts
[1:13:59] preaching no he catches the mystery God
[1:14:02] starts speaking to
[1:14:05] him now listen Here's my thought on that
[1:14:08] like dad's thought is about Abraham why
[1:14:10] was Abraham
[1:14:12] called God's not respector
[1:14:15] persons Abraham's the only one that
[1:14:17] responded to the
[1:14:20] call many men from here backwards is
[1:14:23] going to say you never spoke to me and
[1:14:26] and God's going to say at judgment he's
[1:14:27] going to say yep right there I said that
[1:14:31] person oh that was you yeah that was
[1:14:35] me oh St Martin remember St Martin in
[1:14:38] the
[1:14:40] dream or not the dream but the day
[1:14:42] before he gives his coat to the
[1:14:44] beggar has a dream that night and it's
[1:14:46] the Lord Jesus standing in the same same
[1:14:49] coat it's me we've been putting this age
[1:14:54] am to be God to the
[1:14:56] people God sees it that
[1:15:00] way what is the war part the angel of
[1:15:03] the church catches the mystery of God so
[1:15:05] in other words one man catches it so all
[1:15:07] of a sudden he's
[1:15:09] separated right all of a sudden he has
[1:15:12] this new light that's never been shown
[1:15:13] before the blue the Indigo the yellow
[1:15:16] whatever it is he they have that
[1:15:18] light but now to have that light
[1:15:21] somebody's got to see it brother Rand
[1:15:23] would have been not a prophet of the end
[1:15:25] time if he had have preached and died in
[1:15:27] 1965 and that was
[1:15:29] it right no somebody thank God caught
[1:15:33] the voice of God and said that man's a
[1:15:35] prophet we need to listen to what he's
[1:15:38] saying that's the voice of God for the
[1:15:40] age that was God speaking to a group of
[1:15:44] people but look not fully yet revealed
[1:15:47] but when he does he catches this mystery
[1:15:50] of God then he goes forth to the what to
[1:15:53] to the people after the mystery has been
[1:15:55] given to
[1:15:56] him it's why I believe that whatever
[1:15:59] that was 1947 when the angel come and
[1:16:02] met brother
[1:16:03] brandom he said I've been sent from the
[1:16:05] presence of
[1:16:07] God and you got these things you got to
[1:16:09] do amen and then God kept telling him
[1:16:12] don't smoke Don't drink don't defile
[1:16:13] your body because of a work for you I
[1:16:15] wish You' have spoke to me like
[1:16:17] that but
[1:16:19] see we're not light reflectors number
[1:16:22] one like that he brother Bron was the
[1:16:24] light reflector reflector for this age
[1:16:26] we got to get caught up in that light
[1:16:29] but he came to him first he said hey I
[1:16:31] got a work for you to do keep
[1:16:37] yourself but when he does he catches
[1:16:39] this mystery and then goes forth to the
[1:16:42] people after the mystery has been given
[1:16:44] to him Goes Forth to the people what
[1:16:46] does he do he begins to Proclaim that
[1:16:50] message and what does it start a war
[1:16:54] a spiritual war today you're having a
[1:16:57] spiritual war if you don't understand
[1:16:59] what I'm saying or what God's speaking
[1:17:00] to you there's a war going
[1:17:03] on but it's a spiritual
[1:17:07] war look and then God takes his
[1:17:09] messenger with the elect of that age and
[1:17:12] lays them away
[1:17:14] asleep and then he drops a plague upon
[1:17:17] the ones that rejected
[1:17:20] it that's why this United States America
[1:17:23] is going to be
[1:17:25] destroyed they got a messenger that
[1:17:28] spoke their language lived in their
[1:17:31] towns went through their pull pets and
[1:17:33] they turned him down America's going to
[1:17:35] get it
[1:17:36] first sorry with the greatest nation and
[1:17:39] I love where I'm living wouldn't live
[1:17:41] nowhere else but she can she's going to
[1:17:43] get it she's going to get it they ain't
[1:17:45] nothing they ain't no Buy Reading other
[1:17:47] day where now they taking them silos
[1:17:48] that they had the nuclear bombs in and
[1:17:50] these rich folks are building their
[1:17:52] their house down in them where nobody
[1:17:54] blow them up guess
[1:17:57] what read the word of God that's a
[1:18:01] little bit futile it don't matter if you
[1:18:03] make it through a nuclear bomb explosion
[1:18:06] soon as you walk out you going to get
[1:18:08] burned to Pieces by the
[1:18:10] radiation so hey get into
[1:18:13] god let's be the light if we be the
[1:18:16] light then not going to worry about the
[1:18:17] rest of it but he lays them asleep then
[1:18:21] he drops a plague upon the one that
[1:18:23] rejects it a temporary this where I want
[1:18:26] to get to a temporary judgment cuz this
[1:18:28] afternoon you're going to see all these
[1:18:29] Flames Flames coming out of his eyes
[1:18:31] feet like brass sword coming out of
[1:18:34] that's all
[1:18:36] judgment but where is he going to judge
[1:18:39] the world
[1:18:41] from his
[1:18:44] bride he drops a plague on them who
[1:18:46] rejects it a temporary judgment and then
[1:18:49] after that is over now look then he goes
[1:18:51] on they denominate bring in
[1:18:53] denominations and start off with that
[1:18:55] man's work like of Wesley and all the
[1:18:57] rest of them then it gets all in the
[1:18:59] scrapple
[1:19:00] again then another mystery comes
[1:19:04] forth then what happens another
[1:19:06] messenger arrives on Earth another
[1:19:09] refraction of the
[1:19:10] light arrives on Earth for a church age
[1:19:13] now
[1:19:15] listen we don't get any more of
[1:19:18] this there's not another
[1:19:20] messenger there's not another age
[1:19:23] this is it right no more we can't say
[1:19:26] well we'll just wait till the next guy
[1:19:28] comes there is no there's only one next
[1:19:30] guy to
[1:19:33] come then when he arrives the trumpet
[1:19:38] sounds he declares
[1:19:41] war see then what happens finally then
[1:19:44] he's caught
[1:19:45] away and then when he's laid away then
[1:19:49] plague Falls destroys them that's why I
[1:19:52] said brother stood one day and he said
[1:19:54] these denominational churches are no
[1:19:56] more than lodges go to one don't lay out
[1:20:00] a church but we may not have church one
[1:20:01] Sunday do like I did I went back to the
[1:20:03] church of my
[1:20:05] Nativity where I was raised and me and
[1:20:07] June got married and dead as the hammer
[1:20:09] I'm sorry it was so formal I asked a
[1:20:13] girl s beside me I said can I say amen
[1:20:15] and I get thrown out she said yeah but
[1:20:17] nobody else did so I
[1:20:21] didn't
[1:20:24] but that's the way it is everywhere
[1:20:26] right even jun's dad realized going to
[1:20:28] Presbyterian Church is nothing but a
[1:20:30] ritual just a ritual you say these
[1:20:32] things you sing two songs you you do a
[1:20:35] doxology and even in the Baptist Church
[1:20:37] they they used to not do that but they
[1:20:39] have a thing they read like Apostles
[1:20:40] Creed almost but it's not the Apostles
[1:20:42] Creed that's kind of funny because they
[1:20:44] hate the Apostles Creed and that's their
[1:20:48] mama but listen brother Brandon that was
[1:20:50] where a war started he come on Earth
[1:20:53] listen God was okay with the
[1:20:55] denomination listen to me until brother
[1:20:57] rown came on the
[1:20:59] scene think about it but Jesus walked
[1:21:03] into the
[1:21:05] temple he said if I had not have come
[1:21:08] here you had a
[1:21:10] cloak you had Ten Commandments that says
[1:21:13] as long as you don't touch that woman
[1:21:15] you're good he said but I say unto you
[1:21:18] boy talking about a
[1:21:19] war I say unto you you just look on a
[1:21:24] woman to lust after and you've committed
[1:21:25] adultery already they hated him for that
[1:21:28] the religious people killed him not the
[1:21:30] people the Beggs on the street the
[1:21:32] religious people killed him CU why there
[1:21:34] was a spiritual death
[1:21:36] declared he said you're
[1:21:40] dead twice plugged up plucked
[1:21:45] up dry Man's
[1:21:47] Bones praise God we were dry Man's Bones
[1:21:51] but according to the word of God
[1:21:53] we got a
[1:21:54] quickening them dry bones have come to
[1:21:57] life and a bride in the end time and
[1:22:00] then when he's laid away then plague
[1:22:02] Falls in other words like I said before
[1:22:04] brother B tells me many many times he
[1:22:05] said there will not this will not
[1:22:06] denominate and there'll not be another
[1:22:08] denomination now we understand that may
[1:22:10] they may have been more cuz there was
[1:22:11] 900 and something if you look them up on
[1:22:13] the Internet there's like 13,000
[1:22:14] different denominations now boy God so
[1:22:16] really
[1:22:18] confused think about that white light
[1:22:20] and it opened up into 13,000 in
[1:22:22] different views
[1:22:25] no God's Sovereign God said you going to
[1:22:28] hear this prophet he preached around the
[1:22:31] world seven times I made sure that we
[1:22:33] kept him on
[1:22:36] tape I made sure brother R stood there
[1:22:38] in 1947 preached his first sermon he
[1:22:41] said they got these new
[1:22:43] gadgets and it was a
[1:22:45] wire that they' got from the war that
[1:22:48] they developed into something that you
[1:22:50] could record voices with well well
[1:22:53] hello now War might have started but the
[1:22:56] real war started when they put that on
[1:22:59] tape
[1:23:01] amen and then when he's laid away then
[1:23:04] the plague Falls destroys him spiritual
[1:23:06] death hits the church and she's gone
[1:23:10] that group then he goes on to another
[1:23:12] listen we don't have one to throw it
[1:23:14] back to musicians come on we don't have
[1:23:16] want to throw it back to we're at this
[1:23:18] is all you either catch this light this
[1:23:20] refraction or you don't get it that's
[1:23:27] right he sent us the spirit of Truth as
[1:23:30] brother B was talk about this
[1:23:32] morning what did he send us he sent us
[1:23:34] what at that day you shall know you'll
[1:23:37] know your Messer for your age it's all
[1:23:41] right I've read about Luther and Wesley
[1:23:43] I'm reading some of their books now not
[1:23:45] that they wrote but about their life and
[1:23:47] it's wonderful but you can see listen
[1:23:50] Martin Luther was a Catholic
[1:23:55] hello he still wanted to pull the
[1:23:57] Catholic church out with him cuz he
[1:24:00] liked some of the things that was going
[1:24:01] on but God said no separate yourself I
[1:24:04] got 95 things you need to write down
[1:24:06] right and when he posted them things on
[1:24:09] that door that excommunicated him from
[1:24:12] the Catholic Church why he caught the
[1:24:14] light of god let's stand to our feet at
[1:24:16] that day you'll know I ask you today do
[1:24:18] you know your messenger and your age
[1:24:22] that you're living in is this the
[1:24:24] message of the hour or is this just
[1:24:26] other something that we're going to go
[1:24:27] and and then we're going to all die and
[1:24:29] and somebody else is going to come back
[1:24:31] up and brother Mike is going to start
[1:24:32] preaching and
[1:24:35] and said
[1:24:38] Mike I said mik oh Michael and Micah
[1:24:43] okay but this is how we're going to know
[1:24:45] the difference the comforter which is
[1:24:46] the Holy Ghost that's why brother BR
[1:24:48] said that was the most important thing
[1:24:49] in your life Esther it's okay I breathe
[1:24:54] but the comforter which is the Holy
[1:24:56] Ghost whom the father will send in my
[1:24:57] name he shall teach you all
[1:25:00] things listen he'll tell you what light
[1:25:03] you're living in he'll reveal to you
[1:25:06] what you need for your
[1:25:08] time and bring all things to your
[1:25:11] remembrance whatsoever I have said unto
[1:25:14] you peace I leave with you my peace I
[1:25:15] give unto you not as the world
[1:25:18] gives give I unto you let not your heart
[1:25:21] be troubled
[1:25:23] neither be afraid cuz there's two
[1:25:26] Spirits coming Matthew 24:24 is going to
[1:25:28] be two spirits in the framework of the
[1:25:31] church false Christ not false not false
[1:25:35] demons false Christ which are
[1:25:38] demons are we singing songs
[1:25:42] now you hear
[1:25:44] that you don't to hear that I guess I
[1:25:47] need to I hear something playing in the
[1:25:49] background
[1:25:50] here look the church Spirit of the
[1:25:52] church people and the bride Spirit of
[1:25:54] the Bride people would be so close
[1:25:56] together till it would deceive the very
[1:25:57] elect if it was possible that's how
[1:26:01] close right that's how
[1:26:03] close that's why brother random came to
[1:26:06] tell
[1:26:07] us the Book of Revelation shows how the
[1:26:09] Antichrist Spirit would come into the
[1:26:12] church defile it make it lukewarm formal
[1:26:17] and Powerless and absolutely Satan has
[1:26:20] done his job that's right
[1:26:23] but it exposes Satan now Reveals His
[1:26:26] work he knows that if the people get the
[1:26:29] true revelation of the true church in
[1:26:31] other words your light for your day cuz
[1:26:33] listen we can't live in Luther's light
[1:26:35] Luther's light will not even get you in
[1:26:37] the body of Christ
[1:26:39] amen it's a different light for a
[1:26:41] different age but we we collect off of
[1:26:44] that same same comes from the same
[1:26:46] Source we believe in Luther's
[1:26:49] justification amen you got to be
[1:26:51] justified by faith Faith it's not by
[1:26:54] works but if you get a true revelation
[1:26:56] of the two Spirits within the framework
[1:26:58] of the Christian church and by God's
[1:27:01] spirit deser and withstand the
[1:27:02] Antichrist Spirit Satan will be
[1:27:04] powerless before her he will be as
[1:27:06] definitely thwarted today as when Christ
[1:27:07] with stood his every effort to gain
[1:27:09] power in the desert Satan hates
[1:27:13] Revelation but we love it amen with true
[1:27:17] Revelation in our lives the Gates of
[1:27:19] Hell cannot Prevail not saying it won't
[1:27:21] come it's going to come
