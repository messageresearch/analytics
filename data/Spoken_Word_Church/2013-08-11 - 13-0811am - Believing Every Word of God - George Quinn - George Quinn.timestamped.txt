[2:27] and that's that's the way a minister
[2:29] feels somebody comes into a place sister
[2:30] pagy when you feel the pool I felt that
[2:33] for some time that that uh I'm sure not
[2:36] just one or two but but there's a lot of
[2:38] you that has want to hear from God and I
[2:41] just pray as brother Ronald pray prayed
[2:43] that God would take the clay lips and
[2:46] push me out of the way and take full
[2:48] control and and and be a blessing to
[2:50] your heart this morning amen uh so it is
[2:53] a joy to be here and uh praise the Lord
[2:56] uh I was talking to my wife sends over
[2:58] her love to you I was just talking to
[2:59] her this morning morning and of course
[3:01] it's about what half 2 in the afternoon
[3:03] there and I in Ireland half 3 and uh
[3:07] they've they've had their service over
[3:09] this morning the what they do when I'm
[3:11] away now because pastors don't generally
[3:13] like um going to another church of the
[3:16] pastor the resident pastors away so uh
[3:20] what we do now we find it works well we
[3:22] play brother brandham and Brother Joseph
[3:24] Bram actually made us a gift of their
[3:27] the best equipment they've got in D D
[3:30] and that was very nice of him and I
[3:32] thanked him for it and uh he sent us
[3:35] back a lovely letter which we
[3:37] treasure and uh you know so we've got
[3:40] anything we want on the I I did have
[3:42] DVDs but not not any not any quality L
[3:45] to what Joseph s over we got many books
[3:48] so the the I don't know I actually
[3:50] forgot to ask her what they were
[3:51] listening to today but I I know one
[3:54] thing uh it was would have been a
[3:55] wonderful message and they've got the
[3:58] books and they can read it as well so
[4:00] they're well fed praise the Lord and
[4:02] we've come for our spiritual food as
[4:04] well amen so we do bring our love over
[4:06] uh to you God is moving amen little bits
[4:10] and pieces and we're always looking out
[4:12] uh amen for that predestinated seed we
[4:15] always are looking out for that amen
[4:17] praise the Lord and um you know that's
[4:20] when brother Bram said when the last
[4:22] person is in uh you know in the Bible
[4:24] it's actually there if you could see it
[4:27] that the Bible tells us that Lydia the
[4:29] purple of seller she was the first
[4:32] European person to come to Christ and if
[4:36] she was the first one there has to be a
[4:39] last one so that's that's that's that's
[4:41] we understand that don't we and uh so
[4:44] praise the Lord uh the the the churches
[4:47] are doing well and the brothers are
[4:49] doing well and uh when I go home I'll be
[4:51] off for a few weeks then we're going
[4:53] over to Scotland which is lovely uh
[4:55] praise the Lord we' be preaching over
[4:57] there I take my wife with me there and I
[4:59] hope to go up to Iona to where Columbo
[5:02] was he always said I don't know if it's
[5:03] true or not but he said if you visit
[5:05] once you'll visit three times so this
[5:07] would be my third visit to the island so
[5:09] amen praise the Lord and of course uh
[5:12] when we left here last year we did go
[5:14] over to India which we were planning on
[5:16] the Lord willing amen always of the Lord
[5:18] is willing and uh we're planning to go
[5:20] back to India again this November so uh
[5:24] last year we went over and uh you know
[5:28] brother brownon the angel told Brother
[5:30] bham never lose your feeling for the
[5:33] people that's a very very dangerous
[5:35] thing for a minister to lose the feeling
[5:37] for the people and praise the Lord uh we
[5:41] must remember where our offerings came
[5:43] from it came from the people and so when
[5:46] we were in Hyderabad at the end of the
[5:48] service a lovely service and they've got
[5:50] a different way of doing things you know
[5:52] so they all started to bring out flowers
[5:54] to me you know not just the ones you put
[5:56] over your neck but flowers bunches and I
[5:58] was standing there getting heavier and
[6:00] heavier with these so I had to call for
[6:02] a table put the flowers down and people
[6:04] kep that's what they wanted to do so I
[6:06] just say amen and uh what a wonderful
[6:08] service lovely weather there too very
[6:10] it's quite hot in and and even in
[6:12] November and um uh we went up to uh well

[6:20] Samuel uh people were going out the door

[6:26] hard to think and that's why I'm getting
[6:28] fairly well into to Har American people
[6:30] think but I'll tell you
[6:33] what but I'll tell you what the Indian
[6:36] people there must be more healings goes
[6:38] on on the way out of the church than

[6:58] and she says do you recognize me me and
[6:59] I just stood back and I said I sure do
[7:03] stand there with her husband shook hands
[7:04] with him too and you could see her
[7:07] lovely hair beginning to grow out again
[7:09] like this last year he brought her to
[7:12] the church they travel a long way to
[7:14] come to the church she whatever stage of
[7:17] cancer she was doing her last treatment
[7:19] and that was it and she she looked
[7:20] pitiful I'll tell you she really did she
[7:22] what had a scarf completely bald had a

[7:27] look like a whale girl and
[7:30] uh n here she
[7:32] was the just Health you know the hair
[7:35] growing down again and I said well
[7:37] praise God and thank God you know and I
[7:39] said to that sister I said you know
[7:41] Sister you might think well last year I
[7:43] just prayed a prayer over you got you
[7:45] out of the way and forgot about you I
[7:47] said I did not I said I prayed for you
[7:49] many many times in Ireland amen so she
[7:52] had come down all that way just to give
[7:54] God the glory amen I'm sure other people
[7:56] prayed for her it's got nothing to do
[7:58] with persons but you know I just really
[8:00] thank God uh to see that that girl
[8:03] rejoicing amen praise praise the Lord

[8:12] Spirit dangles these things in front of
[8:14] you amen you should you should take take
[8:17] note you should take note and uh there
[8:20] was one little woman and she's a good
[8:22] Christian girl a middle-aged woman and
[8:25] uh up in uh Bombay and uh she came out
[8:30] for prayer at the end of the service we
[8:31] were only there a couple of days and uh
[8:33] she had a guer and I never seen anybody
[8:36] with a guer like that you stuck out
[8:37] under their throat and so I have a
[8:39] little prayer cloth I keep it in my
[8:40] wallet and uh praise the Lord uh I said
[8:44] well I'll lay this on you I'll pray for
[8:46] you and then when I was praying I just
[8:49] think of you were praying for them I
[8:50] just try and keep this short but you
[8:53] know just think if you were praying for
[8:54] that sister what would you do you're
[8:56] standing there there's a guy there well
[8:58] are you you going to believe God's going
[9:00] to take it off or is he going to take a
[9:01] year to take it off or what's he going
[9:02] to do so I said well Lord I should
[9:04] really be believing you here you know so
[9:07] anyway we prayed the prayer and I said I
[9:09] should be really believ in you here so I
[9:11] took off the guer and I'm looking really
[9:13] intent and and I don't see nothing there
[9:16] so I turned around to one of the
[9:17] brothers I said would you look at that I
[9:19] said is that gone he said sure is so she
[9:22] was beginning to to to feel it as well
[9:25] about the size of a good egg you know

[9:31] he doesn't know what happened to that
[9:34] guer but I tell you what something touch

[9:40] and uh so we we've always the pleasure I
[9:42] don't know how many but the time we get
[9:44] the glory I just hope that every person
[9:46] we baptized uh gets in mix it in
[9:48] somewhere along the line you know but we
[9:51] we certain are always baptizing people
[9:52] there and it's got less and less you
[9:55] know over the years but you might
[9:57] baptize five or six or seven whatever
[9:59] just whatever the needs are you baptize
[10:02] them there and we had a we had a day off

[11:46] and all that but my she's she's
[11:48] murmuring to herself and her legs are
[11:51] flying about you know and she's not
[11:54] comfortable and I said well what
[11:55] happened to her and they said well it's
[11:57] something to do with her heart and they
[11:59] said they've told her they can do
[12:00] nothing for her and and I said well I'm
[12:02] sorry to hear that she been in her 50s
[12:04] maybe and um her name was Mary and uh
[12:08] praise the Lord said will you pray for
[12:10] her and I said yeah that's that's all we
[12:11] can do and that's all we will do and
[12:13] dear folks I tell you what it's it's
[12:16] just a simple prayer right that's it
[12:19] it's just a simple prayer but if that
[12:20] prayer touches God if you make contact
[12:23] amen I tell you if you have the prayer
[12:25] of faith then you will bring a reaction
[12:29] from God now you're sitting in your seat
[12:31] this morning if you do that contact him
[12:35] and release your faith I'll tell you
[12:38] what it will bring a reaction he'll
[12:40] never react not react to Faith like the
[12:43] little woman that touched His Garment
[12:44] he'll never he'll always do it and uh
[12:47] you know so we left we went to another
[12:49] brother but at least we got a cup of
[12:50] coffee but any any one of them if we'd
[12:53] asked for tea or coffee we would have
[12:54] got it but we went to another little
[12:56] brother and uh he's doing well too last
[12:59] year they'd give him nearly up but he's
[13:01] doing well had a bit of Fellowship there
[13:03] and then we eventually went down to the
[13:04] seashore and the fishermen were there a
[13:06] big Mount of fish just spread out you
[13:09] know so you take whatever you're going
[13:11] to take and buy it and take it home we
[13:13] had a nice nice meal out of that and uh
[13:15] it was it was really nice praise the
[13:17] Lord but uh that evening the little
[13:20] little guy came around on his sco
[13:22] motorbike and he jumped out he's all
[13:24] excited and he run up and he says M's up
[13:26] M's up you know and M talking Mar's
[13:29] talking you know and uh I said well
[13:32] praise God for that you know and uh not
[13:34] only that but uh so the doctor they
[13:37] phoned up the doctor he says bring her
[13:39] right up and he examined her he said
[13:40] I've got I can't explain it he said I
[13:42] don't know what's happened to her he
[13:43] said can't explain it so praise the Lord
[13:47] just just so wonderful you know and uh
[13:49] not only that there but you know uh when
[13:51] when we were leaving uh they were
[13:53] telling me that she was up and she was
[13:55] singing Christian songs so God bless her
[13:58] and you know I tell you one thing see
[13:59] what it does in India is it creates an
[14:02] atmosphere in that Village so once
[14:05] people here can it's a stepping stone
[14:07] it's a stepping stone to bring the word
[14:09] amen as well you know and of course in
[14:12] India we always help them with uh some
[14:14] of the poer people there is some poor
[14:16] people some of them are some of the the
[14:18] churches now give us offerings brother
[14:19] uh brother Samuel and it's wonderful
[14:21] just to help us on our way and uh uh but
[14:24] yet there is some of Po ones and we
[14:26] still buy them the rice buy them their
[14:28] Dow and their oil and whatever we can do
[14:30] uh to help them we we do it amen help
[14:33] the poor help the poor pastors to to
[14:35] give them a gift and I tell you what I
[14:38] just heard this morning that you'll help
[14:40] them uh them people somewhere in Africa
[14:43] or Filipino wherever it is just to to to
[14:45] get the gospel out amen wonderful and
[14:49] the little children actually give me a
[14:50] love offering in India it was it was
[14:52] very very lovely but anyway let me go
[14:54] down just and finish off here uh in
[14:56] March this year amen uh we went back to
[15:00] Thailand and uh you know the devil's
[15:04] real and the devil's real and God is
[15:07] real amen God is real but uh when I get
[15:10] over to Thailand uh I I couldn't get
[15:13] into my email and I I don't know why I
[15:16] couldn't get in because I was answering
[15:17] all the questions you know the typing
[15:18] the question and all this graffiti kind
[15:20] of thing and I couldn't get into it and
[15:22] I didn't get into it so I couldn't email
[15:25] the people that I was going to I
[15:27] couldn't email home and uh uh not only
[15:31] that there but I looked up my my ticket
[15:33] and I had the wrong part of the what you
[15:35] print off I didn't have the E uh a
[15:38] ticket part and I thought oh this is
[15:40] good so if I go up to the airport I give
[15:42] them my passport and if that doesn't
[15:45] show up you know well where's your
[15:47] ticket I don't have it so it was a real
[15:50] fight I'll tell you it was a real fight
[15:51] the the song leader he had to go into
[15:53] the hospital to get the Sten in and it
[15:56] was a real battle oh boy it sure was but
[15:58] you know something folks sometimes God
[16:01] lets that happen to see what you're
[16:03] going to do amen and I'll tell you what
[16:05] I did uh on the Wednesday night uh I got
[16:08] on my knees and the Lord spoke to me
[16:11] about Abraham and he said that Abraham
[16:14] did not even consider the deadness of
[16:18] his own body now that's awesome stuff he
[16:21] didn't even consider I cannot do it but
[16:25] God said I will do it and he did do it
[16:28] Hal alah and so that's what I believed
[16:31] and I came home and I preached a message
[16:33] on it so I I wrote it in my notes before
[16:35] it was even done that I am not
[16:38] considering what my eyes and what my
[16:40] senses are telling me but I'm
[16:42] considering that God sent me here and
[16:44] that we will overcome and that
[16:46] everything will work out right and from
[16:48] the next morning everything just started
[16:50] to come into place and it was wonderful
[16:52] how that happened so I can remember that
[16:54] very very very well amen and uh we had a
[16:57] wonderful time there we always help the
[16:59] little church and they are poor and uh
[17:02] uh you know so we get them rice and
[17:04] things like that and we baptize two
[17:06] precious people and uh I don't know if
[17:09] it was translated or not but when I
[17:11] baptized them and they were standing
[17:13] there in the water and I said it was a
[17:15] man and a woman and I said to them are
[17:17] you happy and they said very happy and
[17:21] they you could see it in their faces you
[17:23] know you could see it in their faces and
[17:25] and that's right so I thank God for
[17:27] these things amen uh wonderful uh and
[17:29] then we flew down to Indonesia uh to
[17:32] midan and somatra I'd never been there
[17:34] before but you know I can I can tell you
[17:38] just the same way as John was our
[17:40] representative and he came back and told
[17:42] us about that New Jerusalem he come back
[17:44] and told us what he saw how the L took
[17:47] the book he was our representative he
[17:49] was there so I was in Indonesia and I
[17:51] can tell you as your representative what
[17:54] it's like amen and the bride is the
[17:56] bride Hallelujah and never been there in
[17:59] my life and just fit it right in
[18:02] Hallelujah wonderful Pastor doing a
[18:05] wonderful work and we met about five or
[18:07] six pastors I believe it was and we had
[18:09] a wonderful time in Indonesia praise the
[18:12] lord we traveled on their their Jets we
[18:14] traveled on their uh uh Railway system
[18:18] and we traveled overnight as well and
[18:20] there's 240 million Muslim people there
[18:23] well not all Muslim but the main reason
[18:25] why there's no trouble is cuz I don't
[18:27] know how many millions of them don't
[18:29] practice nothing they just name only so
[18:32] as many people that got as you well know
[18:33] in America as well in Ireland name only
[18:36] Catholics name only you know yeah name
[18:38] only so that means that there was no
[18:40] persecution on the Christians and I'm
[18:42] glad about that you know and that's
[18:44] where the tsunami head over if you
[18:45] remember Sumatra there five mli islands
[18:47] in Indonesia and down in Jakarta the
[18:50] main Pastor there we didn't get down
[18:52] that far but he was just on the phone
[18:54] and he was just D for us to come down so
[18:56] maybe uh again we might get down to
[18:59] Jakarta amen but wonderful time and
[19:01] there was a little Pastor there he was
[19:03] standing crying at the pulit and he said

[19:07] sad he said no I'm crying because I'm
[19:09] happy amen crying with tears of joy
[19:12] Hallelujah because God had come down and
[19:14] touched him and the word just touched
[19:16] him and he was so blessed his little
[19:18] wife um she was having a little bit of
[19:20] trouble but uh when we left he was on
[19:23] the phone to her and she she told him
[19:26] she couldn't walk from A to B I don't
[19:28] know the distance because I never
[19:29] inquired but wherever it was it may have
[19:31] been across the street it may be a mile
[19:33] I don't know but I don't think it was
[19:34] very far and she couldn't walked it
[19:36] without stopping Midway
[19:39] and and and she said to her husband she
[19:42] said I went over and I came back and

[24:18] that you can well imagine then it was
[24:20] time to go uh the pastor went into this
[24:23] kind of little place and he was shaking
[24:25] hands with some people and I went in
[24:27] behind him and there she was sitting on
[24:29] the bed smiling just rejoicing and God
[24:33] had just touched her and I I don't know

[24:37] glad I I I I'm glad about that folks uh
[24:40] prayer is real it it is real amen it's
[24:44] real and I love to to see God doing

[25:07] they're in my little uh what do you call
[25:09] it the the wi the we pin thing there so
[25:13] but I got them few I just got them
[25:15] printed and uh you'll see the bus that
[25:17] we went on overnight to go right up to
[25:19] the north of of Thailand and right there
[25:24] the M tribe is my sister-in-law asked me
[25:27] years ago
[25:28] is there anybody there I said I don't
[25:29] know one one soul but you know this year
[25:32] there's a pastor amen and he's coming
[25:35] into this word and who can run better to
[25:37] his own people than he can so thank God
[25:40] for these things and it's wonderful amen
[25:42] we went right into Laos and they are
[25:45] just like Vietnam they're a military
[25:47] State and uh but uh they don't want you
[25:49] to practice Christianity they certainly
[25:52] wouldn't agree with a with an outsider
[25:54] like me preaching but I got the
[25:56] opportunity to speak to the people
[25:57] people are down by the Riverside amen
[26:00] and uh and it was a wonderful service
[26:02] and just like yourselves just attempt to
[26:04] the word believe in the word and my I
[26:07] tell you what I know God's got a bride
[26:10] and Leos so we had a wonderful time and
[26:12] I was telling brother earing about the
[26:14] little girl Esther I believe her name is
[26:17] and she has to get blood every I think
[26:19] she' to get it every three months or
[26:20] something when I was there the first
[26:23] time but now he said you know God
[26:24] touched her she doesn't need half of
[26:26] that and we prayed for for her again and
[26:28] she's a lovely little girl she doesn't
[26:30] look too for an 8-year-old she doesn't
[26:31] look like she's it but you know
[26:34] wonderful and I trust God bless blesses
[26:36] eser today Amen brother uh boomy is his
[26:39] name bumy KO but he you know he's I'll
[26:42] tell you who he's like he's like Fred
[26:44] Flintstone amen so if you can remember

[27:01] that's right I said but make sure it's
[27:03] the full name amen the full title you
[27:06] know the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[27:08] so um they are having a little bit of
[27:10] persecution from the denominations now
[27:12] because that's a break you know but
[27:15] certainly I would rather drink Branch
[27:17] water and and eat hard bread and have
[27:20] the truth than than stay a big
[27:22] organization and have it all all made no
[27:24] sir I wouldn't want that amen so we had
[27:27] a good time there and I really enjoyed
[27:29] it and that was wonderful to to see
[27:31] there was four tribal pastors there uh
[27:33] when we had that service and it was
[27:35] wonderful and it was really enjoyable so
[27:37] that's what we did that's what we did
[27:39] there last year so may it may it bless
[27:41] you to hear that little testimony amen
[27:44] and of course what what you give last
[27:45] year amen uh we took it over and we used
[27:48] it and that's that's part of your
[27:50] offerings all went into that there so
[27:52] God bless you amen I didn't come here
[27:54] looking to for that because I'll Tell
[27:56] You Folks I don't even concern myself
[27:58] about them things anymore all I know is
[28:00] that when I'm going whatever God wants
[28:02] me to have that's what I'll have

[29:30] which the Lord thy God LED
[29:32] thee these 40 years in the wilderness to
[29:36] Humble thee and to prove thee to know
[29:40] what was in thine heart whether thou
[29:43] wouldst keep his Commandments or no and
[29:45] he humbled thee and suffered thee to
[29:48] hunger and fed thee with Mana which thou
[29:51] knewest not neither did thy fathers know
[29:54] that he might make thee know and and
[29:57] this is the message this is the title of
[29:59] the message today that he might make
[30:01] they
[30:03] know that uh let me see that
[30:06] man does not live by bread only but by
[30:11] every word that proceeds out of the
[30:15] mouth of the Lord does mine live that's
[30:18] right thy remant wax not old upon thee
[30:21] neither did thy foot swell these 40
[30:24] years Thou shalt also consider an nine
[30:26] heart that as a man chasteneth his son
[30:30] so the Lord thy God chasteneth thee
[30:34] therefore Thou shalt keep the
[30:36] Commandments of the Lord thy God to walk
[30:38] in his ways and to fear Him for the Lord
[30:42] thy God bringeth thee into a good land a
[30:45] land of Brooks of water of fountains and
[30:48] depths that spring out of the valleys
[30:49] and Hills a land of Wheat and barley
[30:52] Vines and fig trees and pomegranates a
[30:56] land of of olive oil and honey Amen Let
[31:01] us just bow for a moment of prayer
[31:03] gracious heavenly father that just
[31:06] Thrills my heart this morning to read
[31:08] that Lord that you have done all these
[31:10] things for us and Lord we come this
[31:15] morning to the god that wants us to live
[31:17] by your every word and we pray father
[31:20] that you will grant that to every one of
[31:22] us that we'll live by every word of God
[31:26] as you reveal it to us so Lord let M
[31:30] decrease let our lord Jesus increase
[31:33] this morning that none be seen save
[31:35] Jesus Christ only we ask it in Jesus
[31:38] name amen praise the Lord
[31:41] amen they tell me amen I'm not sure but
[31:45] I think they they tell me that uh
[31:48] illustrations are uh remembered better
[31:52] than what people preach amen and uh I I
[31:56] I want to prove that to to see if that's
[31:57] true or not so maybe brother deck when I
[31:59] come back next year I might ask you uh
[32:01] what you remember did you remember the
[32:04] message the title or did you remember
[32:06] the little illustration I read one there
[32:08] and I think sister Regina mentioned
[32:09] something about it last night about uh
[32:11] about Jesus but this one was a a woman
[32:14] and she was uh canning the beans and she
[32:18] had a little boy I don't know what age
[32:19] he was maybe nine or whatever not and
[32:22] anyway so she asked him would he go down
[32:24] into the cupboard and and and get her
[32:26] something and bring it out like some
[32:28] some beans or something that she could
[32:29] check the dates or whatever she asked
[32:31] them to go down he said but mom he said
[32:32] it's dark in there and she said I know I
[32:35] know she said but it's okay she Jesus is
[32:38] in there and uh he says okay you know
[32:42] and she don't you worry you'll be safe
[32:44] you know I see a little boy down here
[32:46] you know brother Joe's boy you know uh
[32:49] you'll be safe Jesus is there so the
[32:52] little boy reluctantly kind of went down
[32:55] into and opened the door and the mom
[32:57] came behind him to find out if uh what
[32:59] he was going to do so he' be
[33:01] okay uh and he opened the door and he
[33:04] pushed it open and he said Jesus I know
[33:07] you're in there mom said would you hand
[33:11] me out a can of
[33:15] beans so so we we we we we'll we'll see
[33:20] we'll see amen what you remember
[33:24] most praise the Lord amen you know I
[33:28] think it was brother Henry green said it
[33:29] many years ago all that God ever
[33:31] required and maybe brother Bram said it
[33:33] but I'm not sure but all that God ever
[33:36] required of a man was that he believed
[33:39] his word that he believed God's word
[33:41] that's all God ever required so when you
[33:42] come boil it all down it comes down to
[33:44] that amen and that's a wonderful uh uh
[33:47] text this morning amen all the
[33:50] Commandments of the Lord and that's what
[33:52] it's entitled this morning believing
[33:55] every word of God Amen
[33:57] and uh praise the Lord all the
[33:59] Commandments which I command thee uh
[34:01] this day shall You observe to do observe
[34:04] to do it means to look at it and take
[34:07] notice of it with the the distinct
[34:09] thought of obedience amen that's what
[34:12] his Commandments are for if we don't
[34:14] obey them what use are they praise the
[34:16] Lord so uh amen that you may live so
[34:19] there's life in obeying What God Says in
[34:21] his Commandments amen and to multiply
[34:24] and go in and possess the land which the
[34:26] Lord swear to your fathers you know we
[34:28] know that we're not God's not going to
[34:30] give me when I go home 50 more Acres of
[34:32] Irish land because uh you know no it's
[34:35] not that this is the land of the holy
[34:37] spirit amen the land where you're living
[34:39] tonight spiritually amen that you may go

[34:44] this is what he wants you to do amen the
[34:46] land of promise amen and uh it's I'm
[34:49] going to speak a little bit on a moment
[34:52] but just to go down this and thou shalt
[34:54] remember it's a good thing to remember
[34:56] uh all the things that that God so I'm
[34:58] going to highlight that in a moment for

[35:15] you now he'll be with you the next step

[35:20] says here Amen to Humble thee and to
[35:24] prove thee and to know what's in your
[35:26] heart you know God I'm going to speak
[35:28] about that a little bit later God wants
[35:30] to know what's in your heart amen he
[35:32] wants to know where you stand amen and
[35:35] uh so that's a good thing and we'll
[35:37] think about that later in a moment and
[35:39] uh and he did humble thee and he caused
[35:41] you to hunger and he fed you Mana praise
[35:44] the Lord that was God's provision amen
[35:46] there it's in your Bible Hallelujah we
[35:48] say oh we believe every word and we
[35:50] believe every word amen and there was
[35:52] the Mana we'll talk about that in a
[35:53] little while as well amen and it says
[35:56] that that he might make thee know right
[36:00] that he might make thee know right you
[36:05] see I I love that I was listening to
[36:07] yesterday uh the the cockman 25 years
[36:10] and they they put together 64 their
[36:13] songs so in one of them songs uh
[36:15] Caroline sings uh about going to the
[36:17] little old church in the corner uh where
[36:20] the preacher preach that morning you got
[36:22] to know that you know that you know
[36:25] that's how real it is and I just put
[36:27] that down when it comes to that he might
[36:30] make thee know that man shall not live
[36:33] by bread only we're so thankful for the
[36:36] bread that we live by every day we give
[36:39] thanks for it amen and uh but this is
[36:43] the spiritual bread amen and that that
[36:46] that when you know that you know that
[36:49] you know that you can't live just by
[36:51] Bread only you need something more in
[36:54] life Hallelujah and that is
[36:57] hearing the word of God that you live by
[37:00] every word that proceeds out of the
[37:03] mouth of the Lord do M live amen so
[37:06] praise God you know uh doesn't it say in
[37:09] one Peter it says that the word of God
[37:12] uh which liveth and abideth forever
[37:14] that's how we live amen and that's what
[37:16] Peter is talking to us about amen so
[37:19] this is really soul food amen praise the
[37:21] Lord that we're talking about today amen
[37:23] sister Jun amen now praise God God and
[37:27] and and uh uh you know not only that
[37:30] there but there's at least two
[37:32] scriptures there that are taken out and
[37:34] carried into your New Testament and
[37:36] repeat it again for you and and one of
[37:38] the ones that one I'll just stay on it
[37:41] for a second because that's the law of
[37:43] the first mansion that's the first time
[37:45] that that ever was put in the word of
[37:47] God and you know I was thinking about it
[37:49] last night brother Samuel that Moses if
[37:52] I said to you where did Moses get the
[37:54] five books from he he had to be in the
[37:56] wilderness cuz he never went into the
[37:58] present Promised Land he never got them
[38:00] there in Egypt so he had to get them in
[38:02] the wilderness how he got them where he
[38:04] went to get them I don't know but I tell
[38:07] you what that's where he got them he got
[38:08] them in the wilderness of siai and he
[38:11] wrote them books and the first time he
[38:12] wrote this inspired book Hallelujah that
[38:16] he put them words in there that's the
[38:17] first time God mentions it like that so
[38:20] therefore it will follow the whole way
[38:22] through the Bible the law of the second
[38:24] mention of the same thing is exactly
[38:25] like the law of the mentioned and the
[38:27] third time it's mentioned it'll contain
[38:30] exactly the same truth and so that's
[38:32] exactly what our lord Jesus as you well
[38:34] know quot it to Satan amen so that's the
[38:38] law of the first mention and the truth
[38:40] will never change amen and then it says
[38:42] here if I can just pull this out very
[38:44] quickly and pass on it said uh about
[38:47] your heart well I'm going to speak about
[38:48] that in a while but as a man Chast his
[38:51] son so the Lord chasteneth thee amen and
[38:55] uh praise the Lord we know Paul picked
[38:57] that out and took it right up into the
[38:59] book of Hebrews and he said in chapter
[39:01] 12 my son despise not the chasings of
[39:06] the Lord amen sometimes you got to
[39:08] correct your child love is corrective
[39:11] sometimes you got to do that amen and do
[39:13] it in love and and he says here so
[39:16] despise not when God is is chastening
[39:19] you and making you right uh and and he
[39:21] says um uh nor uh let me see uh faint
[39:26] when thou art rebuked of him so we don't
[39:29] want to uh be fainting and say oh Lord
[39:31] what are you what are you letting all
[39:32] this happen on me for there's always a
[39:34] higher motive a higher Purpose with God
[39:37] God's Not Like Us folks we were talking

[39:41] higher Hallelujah his ways are higher
[39:44] he's he's he's he's not finite like we
[39:47] are he's infinite amen you know it's
[39:50] very hard to explain God I'm so glad
[39:53] that when Jesus came I see a human being
[39:56] there that in him all the fullness of
[39:58] the God had dwelt that I can explain but
[40:01] where God came from I can't explain
[40:03] Hallelujah he's Eternal didn't have a
[40:06] beginning that won't have an end so it's
[40:08] wonderful and he said don't F so things
[40:11] are tough for you don't F hallelujah
[40:14] amen and uh praise the Lord why because
[40:17] the whom the Lord loveth if he didn't
[40:20] love you he just let you live any old
[40:22] way but he does love you that's why he
[40:25] sent the prophet of day to give us the
[40:27] things that we have to live by them amen
[40:30] and praise the Lord amen and uh uh he he
[40:35] he scourgeth any son that he receives so
[40:39] that is he cleanses us up and he fills
[40:41] us with his own holy spirit amen and uh
[40:44] we we thank God for that there amen now
[40:47] bless the Lord and when Moses here is
[40:50] reciting he talks about this great land

[44:17] illustration you know if you went over
[44:19] to the Himalayas and you wanted to climb
[44:20] up one of them high mountains and and
[44:23] you met this little man standing there
[44:25] and he got all his little gear on and
[44:27] his rope and his Peck and all and he's
[44:29] you know and he said I'll take you up

[44:34] looking around for one of them old
[44:35] sherpers you know and you meet one and

[44:39] mountain many times would you take me up
[44:42] that mountain sure will well which one
[44:46] would you go up with right I mean ask
[44:48] yourself you know the fella how many
[44:50] times have you claimed that oh this is
[44:52] my first time but I'll take you up I
[44:53] don't think you would go with them I

[45:12] the speed limit to go but this this fell
[45:13] that was driving he didn't know that you
[45:16] know but I was over in the the other one
[45:19] and the inside one anyway but you know
[45:20] so people had to go into the middle in

[45:24] know what I'm talking about my guide H
[45:26] you know Jeremiah I love Jeremiah my
[45:29] father thou W my guide it's wonderful
[45:31] that that God is our guide this morning
[45:33] you know and and may I say this uh

[45:41] whole town of Jerusalem or city burning
[45:44] down and the Temple's been uh burnt and
[45:47] and he's standing there and he raises
[45:49] his hands up to God and he says great is

[47:56] terrible you know you look at the
[47:58] denominations today from the Catholic
[48:00] Church time and they've got a name that
[48:03] they live but the Bible says they're
[48:06] dead imagine if you had a name you're a

[49:32] shalt go I will guide thee with mine eye
[49:35] thank God there's an unseen hand there's
[49:37] something just watching us every day and
[49:39] we were talking about it in coming

[49:43] folks we have moral Free Will as
[49:45] Christians there's no you you won't give
[49:47] me one scripture where God will force me

[51:12] uh praise the Lord but that's not what
[51:14] he's talking about for us the clothes
[51:16] that we're wearing folks is that he's
[51:18] clothed Us in his own righteousness the
[51:20] white linen is the righteousness of the
[51:22] Saints and brother that is never born
[51:25] Hallelujah that's never spoiled all the

[51:55] your your feet Shaw with the preparation
[51:59] of the Gospel of of peace brother that
[52:01] will never fail that will never fail

[52:06] peace your feet shwed with the gospel of
[52:10] peace amen you know uh God wants uh to
[52:13] guide you into peace that's his desire
[52:16] Hallelujah I would trust that you would
[52:18] all have peace this morning but I I met
[52:21] a young man that didn't have that peace
[52:24] amen and and I I trust that God touched
[52:26] him that that peace would come but God
[52:29] wants to do that as Zachariah prayed
[52:31] that prayer at the birth of John the
[52:32] Baptist he said and it to give light
[52:35] unto them that sit in darkness and in
[52:37] the shadow of death and to guide our
[52:40] feet in the way of Peace Hallelujah you
[52:43] see the devil doesn't know anything
[52:45] about peace but we as Sins Of God Amen
[52:49] when I was in India last year uh the
[52:51] brother he got some thyroid uh trouble
[52:53] or whatever not so he finally goes to
[52:56] this occup rist now I thought they used
[52:58] to stick needles in here but I don't
[52:59] think it's I'm not sure but this guy had
[53:02] wooden wooden needles so I'm sitting
[53:04] watching all this here and and uh uh
[53:08] when he finished he said would you like
[53:10] to have a go and I said well okay so he
[53:13] took my hand he start this big long
[53:14] thing and he pushed it in here and he's
[53:16] pushing in right you know that's okay he
[53:18] comes here and he's starting to push it
[53:20] in that was okay so he got my thumb and
[53:22] he's nearly had it bent right off me you
[53:24] know and he's pushing in and he said
[53:25] that's
[53:27] okay and he said to me do you know he
[53:29] said your body's at perfect peace with
[53:31] itself I said yes sir that's exactly
[53:34] right that's what he said brother dick
[53:36] I'll tell you what and you know and so I
[53:38] said that's okay that's no evidence to
[53:40] me you know because he said that but he
[53:42] said to me something he said but there
[53:45] is a little thing he said you see your
[53:47] left knee and I said yes sir he said you
[53:50] got a little trouble there I said yes I
[53:52] do he said but that's nothing to worry
[53:53] about and he stay right CU as long as I
[53:55] keep exercising that you know when I go
[53:57] and do my exercises you know I've got no
[53:59] trouble with that KN amen so there must
[54:01] be a little bit something to it cuz he
[54:03] touch that point you know so God wants
[54:05] to guide he's the author of Peace amen
[54:07] and he certainly wants to guide us in
[54:09] peace and he has not give us the spirit
[54:10] of fear this morning we don't need the
[54:12] fear you know you know I've got a whole
[54:14] message coming up to my church about
[54:16] fear the Fear Factor amen and I'll tell
[54:19] you what folks tonight we don't need
[54:20] fear you don't need to fear about
[54:22] nothing amen you don't need the fear
[54:23] when you go out you don't need to fear
[54:25] when you come back Hallelujah you go by
[54:27] faith every morning you live Lord Jesus

[54:32] are with me FEI that you will look after
[54:34] me Fe that no matter what happens you'll
[54:36] be right there with
[54:38] me that's it Hallelujah wonderful praise
[54:41] the Lord amen see I'm glad about that
[54:44] there amen and said Mark the perfect
[54:47] mind amen watch your pastor watch put
[54:50] away it watch these brothers and see if
[54:53] their ways are not ways of peace that's
[54:55] right so it's so true you know and I
[54:57] love that song when peace like a river
[55:00] you know we've all sat there beside the
[55:01] river and so peaceful you know so that's
[55:04] what God wants your peace to be like
[55:06] this morning amen but you say oh brother
[55:08] sometimes the old sea belows roll that's
[55:10] exactly right too but there's times with
[55:12] peace like a river there if your life is
[55:15] all storm there's something wrong that's
[55:17] right I mean God wants you to walk and
[55:19] ordain peace for his people amen and of
[55:21] course uh amen uh let the God of Peace
[55:25] in your heart says Paul and and and
[55:27] numbers I love it where he says uh amen
[55:31] that the Lord lift up the light of his
[55:32] countenance and give you peace that
[55:34] would be our prayer this morning and of
[55:36] course what Jesus himself said my peace
[55:40] H there's no peace like got peace folks
[55:42] the peace that he has the peace that he

[56:25] Pride that is what was found in in
[56:27] Lucifer amen the day that Pride was

[56:54] where he said this looks familiar and it
[56:57] was because he was doing the death
[56:59] Circle I tell you he was doing the death
[57:01] Circle and you know something then when
[57:04] he said to the Lord Lord amen please

[57:09] to hear him say Amen okay he's a wise
[57:12] guy you think you know I'm not say like
[57:14] that in a wrong sense but you know you
[57:15] think you got the answer you think you

[57:23] you know don't be ashamed of that you
[57:25] can't do it you know you've got someone
[57:27] beside you who can do it he just wants
[57:29] to be called on the scene to help you
[57:31] out to do it wonderful isn't it
[57:34] Hallelujah I tell you what yes and so uh
[57:38] you know a Hoy Spirit goes before a fall
[57:41] and and it's that's in Proverbs 16: 19
[57:44] it says this better it is to be of a
[57:47] humble spirit with the lowly amen you
[57:49] know something folks it doesn't matter
[57:51] to me amen I can sleep in a lowly place
[57:54] going into a lonly Little House
[57:56] Hallelujah maybe just a dirt floor it

[58:01] in them people's hearts that's all
[58:03] important amen and and I thank God for
[58:05] it and I'd rather be with them than to
[58:07] sit up in some big gambling casino you

[58:11] dollars to gamble away tonight I lost it
[58:13] all so what I've got millions yeah no

[58:18] you today hallelujah praise God then to
[58:21] divide the spoil with the pride amen
[58:23] well could I just give you illustration
[58:25] on that amen and again brother Samuel we
[58:28] were talking about this he me he
[58:30] actually mentioned uh Manasseh today so
[58:32] he did and Hezekiah that Hezekiah prayed
[58:36] when when when when Isaiah said you know
[58:38] I set your house in order you're going
[58:39] to die and he did and he spread that
[58:41] letter before the Lord and God granted
[58:43] him 15 more years amen and that's a
[58:46] wonderful story praise the Lord and you
[58:48] can work it out you know whatever way
[58:50] you want but but I'll tell you what if
[58:53] he had have died at that time there
[58:55] would have been no
[58:56] Manasseh and Manasseh was one if not the
[58:59] most evil guy he was one of them of the
[59:02] Kings of Israel a Judah and so cuz he
[59:05] was only 12 when he began to reain so he
[59:08] was born in the time that God extended
[59:10] to to to to Hezekiah and uh but God
[59:14] knows what he's doing you see God's
[59:16] purposes are above all things folks
[59:18] that's the main thing praise the Lord
[59:20] you just know that that God's purposes
[59:22] are above all things and his purpose
[59:24] will be saved amen and when we know that
[59:26] our name is in the Book of Life the
[59:28] Lamb's Book of Life I beg your pardon
[59:30] then we can rest on that Hallelujah
[59:31] ain't going to be rubbed out you're
[59:33] going to be there amen and as brother
[59:35] Donnie said the other night and a few
[59:37] other people you know when it all the
[59:39] Rapture comes I'm going to be there amen
[59:41] that's it as long as I'm there so you
[59:43] make sure to the same thing this morning
[59:45] amen praise the Lord now manasa listen I
[59:48] just if I could read this for a second I
[59:49] go on as fast as I can here um I might
[59:52] have to leave some of the said but
[59:53] you'll understand that and the Lord
[59:54] speak to Manas unto the people but they
[59:56] would not hearken and wherefore the Lord
[59:58] brought unto them the captains of the
[1:00:00] host of the king of Syria which took
[1:00:03] Manasseh among the thorns and burned him
[1:00:05] with feathers he burned with feathers
[1:00:07] chins and carried him to Babylon so that
[1:00:11] was that's where he ended up amen it
[1:00:12] wasn't very nice and when he was in
[1:00:15] Affliction he besought the Lord as God
[1:00:18] now I was thought he was just a wicked
[1:00:20] old man he died a wicked old man but I'm
[1:00:22] not not so and so he besov the Lord as
[1:00:24] God some something of his daddy must
[1:00:27] have rubbed off him and uh humbled
[1:00:29] himself greatly before the god of his
[1:00:32] fathers and prayed unto him and he was
[1:00:36] intreated of him and heard his
[1:00:39] supplication and brought him again to
[1:00:41] Jerusalem into his kingdom and then
[1:00:44] manasse knew that the Lord he was God
[1:00:48] and he was a changed man amen now uh
[1:00:51] praise the Lord because look what the
[1:00:53] good he goes on to do and he took away
[1:00:55] the strange gods and the idol the idol
[1:00:58] out of the house of the Lord and all the
[1:01:01] altars that he had built in the M of the
[1:01:03] house of the Lord in Jerusalem he cast
[1:01:05] them out of the city amen wow that's
[1:01:08] wonderful and he repaired the altar of
[1:01:10] the Lord amen sacrificed peace offerings
[1:01:14] thank offerings commanded Judah to serve
[1:01:16] the Lord God of Israel nevertheless the
[1:01:19] people did sacrifice in high places but
[1:01:21] only to the Lord so what I want to say
[1:01:24] is humility
[1:01:25] Works amen and if God needs to make me
[1:01:28] humble then Lord Make Me humble amen
[1:01:31] praise God but it really works amen if
[1:01:34] he hadn't humbled himself that story
[1:01:36] would not have finished as it did amen
[1:01:40] and so let your let your clothes be
[1:01:42] humility folks and it's just like a you
[1:01:44] know when you can stand up in the front
[1:01:46] of the people and say oh God I thank you
[1:01:48] I'm so humble well there's something
[1:01:50] wrong there's something wrong humility
[1:01:53] like you couldn't bring in a sheep in
[1:01:54] the day there and say night do you know
[1:01:56] how much wool you've grown in the last 6
[1:01:58] months that sheep would look up to you
[1:02:00] like the horses last night and they say
[1:02:01] pardon you know it doesn't care about
[1:02:04] how much grow world it's growing it's
[1:02:06] just as long as the grass is there it's
[1:02:08] SE in the grass and that's the way it is
[1:02:10] with humility it's a cloth that you're
[1:02:12] covered with but you don't even realize
[1:02:14] it amen praise the Lord okay Hallelujah

[1:02:37] actually missed a page here so it's a
[1:02:38] good thing because our time will not
[1:02:40] allow it but you'll find it there all in
[1:02:42] Exodus 16 about the Mana and uh praise

[1:16:58] the first uh when I made this up and it
[1:17:01] just spoke to me uh the first thing I

[1:17:05] illustration was in numbers where uh the
[1:17:10] people had been disobedient and God had
[1:17:12] sent the fiery serpents among them all
[1:17:15] and uh so you can read it there and the
[1:17:17] people speak against God against Moses
[1:17:19] and he sent the fiery serpents because
[1:17:21] they were complaining about Egypt
[1:17:23] they wanted to go back the garlic and
[1:17:25] the onions and the fish from the sea it
[1:17:27] was so nice you know you know you would
[1:17:30] be surprised how many people stay behind
[1:17:32] in Babylon when when isra and Nehemiah
[1:17:36] all them ones came across zable all that
[1:17:39] you'd be surprised to many stayed behind
[1:17:41] because it was a cushy number amen the
[1:17:43] Jews learned all their business over in
[1:17:44] Babylon and and thousands maybe tens of
[1:17:47] thousands of them stayed in Babylon but
[1:17:49] you see the remnant came back hallelujah
[1:17:52] it's always going to be a Remnant folks
[1:17:54] Amen to press on and so uh to the
[1:17:57] Overcomers now and here they were
[1:17:59] murmuring and complaining amen they
[1:18:01] could see no good at than nothing and uh
[1:18:04] uh they said oh our soul do love this
[1:18:07] bread that's what they said about the
[1:18:09] Mana our soul not our body we know we
[1:18:12] need to eat that but our soul that Lo it
[1:18:15] amen and God just had enough and you
[1:18:17] know that's right I tell you what you
[1:18:19] know I think brother Brown said that God
[1:18:21] run into patience with uh some
[1:18:23] sure did he sure did you're not going to
[1:18:25] try put my gifts on on show you know oh
[1:18:28] tie me up I can break it you know he
[1:18:30] lost patience you know so don't let God
[1:18:32] lose patience with you this morning amen
[1:18:35] and here they were and the Lord sent
[1:18:37] fairy serpents among them and uh praise
[1:18:39] the Lord that b them and and much people
[1:18:42] died therefore the people came to Moses
[1:18:44] and said we have sinned you know God has
[1:18:47] way of making you it really does you
[1:18:49] know it keep you on your toes you know
[1:18:51] you might just get start to get relaxed
[1:18:53] and I'll take you next thing is your
[1:18:54] little crisis and I tell you P you back
[1:18:56] on your toes and get you back to prayer
[1:18:58] oh Lord amen see so he knows hard to do
[1:19:01] it with all of us and and here he was
[1:19:03] and and uh Moses prayed and and and the
[1:19:07] Lord told him to make that fiery serpent
[1:19:09] amen and you know it was so simple God
[1:19:11] in Simplicity you didn't have to have a
[1:19:14] diploma amen but hard to live in the
[1:19:17] wilderness but my goodness all you had
[1:19:20] to do was L and live that's all
[1:19:23] and can you imagine that there would
[1:19:25] have been people there that said that's
[1:19:28] too simple how could looking at a bra
[1:19:32] snake on a pole heal me I need a doctor
[1:19:35] get me a good doctor from Egypt and
[1:19:37] he'll get me right that's not what God
[1:19:39] Said folks if you're going to live by
[1:19:41] every word of God here you are right
[1:19:45] here in this story what are you going to
[1:19:46] do right is it going to be too simple
[1:19:49] for you have you got beyond that and he
[1:19:52] turned run and he said amen look that's
[1:19:55] all you got to do you didn't have to pay
[1:19:57] any money you didn't have to buy any
[1:20:00] first ID Kats or nothing like that you
[1:20:02] just had to look Hallelujah and
[1:20:05] something happened in your body you
[1:20:06] would feel it hallelujah hallelujah and
[1:20:09] you were healed why because you believe
[1:20:12] what God
[1:20:13] Said oh I love it Jesus said Heaven and
[1:20:16] Earth will pass away we know it's there
[1:20:20] it's going to be fulfilled but as he
[1:20:22] said my my word will not pass away my
[1:20:26] word will not pass away amen now let us
[1:20:28] get on so there's a story of just
[1:20:31] obeying what God Said simple but obeying
[1:20:34] it and you live amen right uh praise the
[1:20:38] Lord you know when he was met the devil
[1:20:40] when he met the devil in the up there in
[1:20:43] the wilderness amen I remember preaching
[1:20:45] to you about how the word came to the
[1:20:48] prophet but the spirit came to the word
[1:20:50] hallelujah and L him out and anointed
[1:20:52] him amen and there he Feast the devil up
[1:20:54] with that praise God it is written Amen
[1:20:58] brother BR said but the gifts he could
[1:21:00] have used him or whatever not to defeat
[1:21:02] the enemy but he used his word amen the
[1:21:06] word of God that defeats the enemy
[1:21:09] anywhere anytime it really does and he
[1:21:11] met him with the word and you know you
[1:21:13] say well that's okay that's that was the
[1:21:15] Lord and brother BR but you know
[1:21:17] something he said the weakest Christian
[1:21:19] doing the same my if if the Devil Comes
[1:21:22] Your away in some form or ship this week

[1:21:37] a wonderful firey heads amen and it's
[1:21:41] wonderful and he said the weakest
[1:21:42] Christian can take that stand and hold

[1:21:47] defeat him amen uh I I I don't know but
[1:21:51] I tell you what friends
[1:21:53] uh I think there's going to be more of a
[1:21:55] falling away that's my own personal
[1:21:58] opinion I could be wrong but I don't
[1:22:00] think so because the Bible says that God
[1:22:03] is going to shake everything that can be
[1:22:06] shaken everything going to shake his
[1:22:09] house to nothing amen hallelujah and
[1:22:12] I'll tell you what praise God he's going

[1:22:16] Samuel I cannot understand it in my
[1:22:18] heart right that any man could say that

[1:22:26] 10:7 you know when the prophet through
[1:22:28] the church he book if you can read where
[1:22:30] he doesn't fulfill it then you're in the
[1:22:32] wrong message you're in the wrong
[1:22:34] message I tell you and if we're going to
[1:22:36] believe every word hallelujah we're
[1:22:38] going to have to see what God has
[1:22:40] Vindicated amen we're going to have to
[1:22:42] see the interpretation of how God's
[1:22:44] interpreted by Vindication amen and uh
[1:22:48] praise the Lord uh we're going to have
[1:22:50] to believe it so certainly we believe it
[1:22:52] today amen uh you know I've heard some
[1:22:55] messages about the token being displayed
[1:22:58] in your life amen and that's true the
[1:23:00] token Life of Christ people should see
[1:23:03] you're a Christian amen you might be a

[1:23:10] Holy cigarette outa no I don't smoke why
[1:23:12] do you not smoke cuz I'm a Christian

[1:23:19] God it'll stand forever we believe it
[1:23:21] Hallelujah we believe it amen the token
[1:23:24] Life of Christ amen the spiritual food

[1:30:37] the start amen and you could go right
[1:30:39] back to Eve Eve didn't believe every
[1:30:41] word that was a trouble and so amen but
[1:30:45] of believing every word you've got three
[1:30:46] Witnesses you've got one here in
[1:30:47] Deuteronomy you've got it there with the
[1:30:49] Lord amen and then you can come right up
[1:30:52] to the the last book of the Bible and it
[1:30:54] says whosoever shall add one word or
[1:30:57] take one word from it there's God giv
[1:31:00] you a whole Panorama of that whole thing
[1:31:02] amen and he said I'll remove his name
[1:31:04] amen out of that book of life no so
[1:31:07] praise God that we go without that amen
[1:31:09] and every word of God is true whether
[1:31:11] it's a prophecy whether it's a
[1:31:13] promise you just lay hold on it amen and
[1:31:17] let God speak to you sir amen let him
[1:31:19] speak to you and and see what he says
[1:31:22] says about you amen praise God it could
[1:31:25] be a proclamation of God behold I come
[1:31:27] quickly let him come quickly to you
[1:31:29] whatever it is don't matter a
[1:31:30] pronouncement or a command What He
[1:31:33] commands you to do amen hallelujah just
[1:31:36] do it amen that's the way we live
[1:31:38] hallelujah praise God this is the things
[1:31:40] if you abide in me and I abide in you
[1:31:42] and this is really I I I'll finish up
[1:31:44] right on this here I can finish n one
[1:31:46] minute praise the Lord you know brother
[1:31:49] Bram says don't become a Bible
[1:31:50] hitchhiker I thought that's a strange
[1:31:52] title a Bible hitch hacker you know and
[1:31:54] you know what a hitch hacker is where
[1:31:56] are you going I don't know where are you
[1:31:57] getting off I don't know wherever you
[1:31:59] put me off you know to get a Li and
[1:32:01] they're hopping bopping about you know
[1:32:03] but we don't want to be like God in the
[1:32:04] Bible we want to be uh grounded and
[1:32:06] settled Hallelujah and the word of God
[1:32:09] and uh we know where we're going um like
[1:32:11] that we don't want to be a Bible hitch
[1:32:12] hacker amen so Jesus defeated the devil
[1:32:15] with that word amen quoted it and do you
[1:32:17] know something that I could even say
[1:32:19] here uh you'd be surprised
[1:32:22] but when Satan came to the Lord and
[1:32:25] contested with him about you know you're
[1:32:28] hungry change him to bread well of
[1:32:31] course he could have did that of course
[1:32:33] Moses could have just smoked the rock
[1:32:35] once and said you know but he didn't he
[1:32:36] smoked it twice but this was the word
[1:32:39] itself amen and when he did that the
[1:32:43] devil did not contest him I think about
[1:32:45] that the devil when he said man shall
[1:32:47] not live by bread alone the devil didn't
[1:32:50] say well hold on a wa minute you know he
[1:32:51] didn't say nothing cuz he knew amen it's
[1:32:55] like jackm you
[1:32:56] know you can't move Hallelujah I've got
[1:32:59] you Hallelujah you've came to the wrong
[1:33:01] thing today you've come to the word
[1:33:02] today Hallelujah and the word will
[1:33:05] always right quote that amen I love it
[1:33:08] praise the Lord so amen now the prophet
[1:33:11] said and this is me write down one word
[1:33:14] broken can break the whole chain so
[1:33:16] that's why everything that God says and
[1:33:19] it's hard when he said love your enemies
[1:33:21] that's not that's not easy but you can
[1:33:23] do it hallelujah amen and and and and
[1:33:26] some Wicked people about but I tell you
[1:33:27] what just love your just let the love of
[1:33:29] God flow through you and that's what it
[1:33:30] takes cuz you'll never do it in the
[1:33:32] natural amen somebody look you can say
[1:33:34] well brother there's somebody at work I
[1:33:35] remember somebody in my job they were
[1:33:37] the same very hard brother than me and
[1:33:39] I'll tell you what but but boy did I get
[1:33:41] the Victory and when I got the victory I
[1:33:43] knew it and every time after that that
[1:33:45] guy didn't even know in my presence he
[1:33:47] didn't even know where he stood cuz I
[1:33:49] had the victory amen and I'll tell you
[1:33:52] what it's wonderful Hallelujah and and
[1:33:54] the Lord will judge us by his attitude
[1:33:56] to his word amen and praise the Lord as
[1:33:59] I said earlier what would we do oh
[1:34:02] friends what would we do if this word
[1:34:03] wasn't available to us today amen look
[1:34:06] at the things that the prophet has
[1:34:07] taught us amen what would we do if we
[1:34:10] didn't have an end time message we would
[1:34:12] just be walling about like a hog you
[1:34:14] know we wouldn't know where we were
[1:34:15] going you know we wouldn't oh my I'm so
[1:34:17] glad I'm so glad amen and uh it is it's
[1:34:21] the sacred word of God now this is the
[1:34:23] last quote said you know we have to do
[1:34:26] something another to settle the end of
[1:34:29] strife so there's no Strife there should
[1:34:31] be no Strife in your life amen there
[1:34:33] should not be and and the word there
[1:34:36] should be no Strife just you believe
[1:34:37] that message and all that Christ was he
[1:34:40] poured into the church what is it
[1:34:43] anointed one to continue his work that's
[1:34:45] what he's done amen and his word might
[1:34:48] continually live amen he live by the
[1:34:52] word of the father man shall not live by
[1:34:54] bread alone but by every word that prees
[1:34:56] out of the mouth of God see that's the
[1:34:57] only way we can live spiritually and so
[1:35:00] it says uh uh it says uh by the word of
[1:35:03] Christ amen that's why the church don't
[1:35:05] live in bread alone but by the word of
[1:35:06] Christ and the Holy Spirit comes in
[1:35:09] takes the word of Christ makes it a
[1:35:11] living action today and these sins shall
[1:35:13] follow them that believe so I trust and
[1:35:17] pray now listen Hallelujah today you
[1:35:21] know God has got strange I I I I felt I
[1:35:25] felt in my heart God was going to speak
[1:35:27] to folks this morning I just felt that
