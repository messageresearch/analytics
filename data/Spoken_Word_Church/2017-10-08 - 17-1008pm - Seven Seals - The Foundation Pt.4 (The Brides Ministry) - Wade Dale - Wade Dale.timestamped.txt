[20:39] this morning because part of it will be
[20:41] what we're going to talk about today and
[20:44] and really last night brother Joe Cantor
[20:47] didn't know the question that he asked
[20:49] about the fivefold ministry I had been
[20:51] teetering with with there was a gap in
[20:54] the brother Darrell nose won't tell me
[20:56] there's a gap that was a gap between
[20:57] here and going to revelations 5 and I
[20:59] was trying to fill that in and and last
[21:01] night we got it filled in and then Ryan
[21:03] just came in and and almost filled it in
[21:06] I told him I was gonna take about 10
[21:08] minutes of introduction and then let him
[21:09] finish for what he was saying this
[21:12] morning but but it's good that we got a
[21:14] ministry that flows good together so
[21:16] that that's really good we know that
[21:17] that's the Lord cuz you know we don't
[21:18] sit and have meetings and discuss what
[21:20] we're gonna preach you know so we know
[21:22] that it's the Lord leading and it kind
[21:24] of gives you like brother branham it
[21:25] kind of gives you a confirmation that
[21:27] maybe we are heading in the right
[21:28] direction when when everybody's kind of
[21:30] you know going in the same way so let's
[21:32] turn
[21:32] revelations 10 and let's finish today
[21:36] we're going to have part for the
[21:37] foundation then we're next Sunday we're
[21:39] going to go into revelations chapter 5
[21:41] but today we want to fill in a little
[21:43] bit of a gap here before we do so let's
[21:46] bow our heads before we get started
[21:48] dear Lord Jesus we pray today Lord them
[21:50] number one that you'll give us a
[21:53] revelation that you will settle us and
[21:56] keep us right here for this appointed
[21:59] time that you will not be just a visitor
[22:02] that you'll be the active participant in
[22:04] the service you take over Lord and your
[22:06] will be done now outside the reigning
[22:09] and all these things Lord we pray that
[22:11] you'd just be with us take care of us
[22:13] Lord be with our homes be with all the
[22:16] cars and the things Lord that are
[22:17] outside with all this rain coming down
[22:20] hard and heavy that everything will be
[22:22] fine and and everything will be for your
[22:24] honor and glory Lord we pray that you'd
[22:26] heal the sick that's among us you said
[22:29] you sent your word and healed us and
[22:30] delivered us from destruction I pray
[22:32] this you'd be with the missionaries on
[22:34] the foreign fields finally give them
[22:35] fruit for their labor bless the ones
[22:37] that are not here Lord take care of them
[22:39] be with the ones that are on the
[22:41] highways traveling be with them Lord
[22:42] touch all the little bride around the
[22:44] world father just give us this day today
[22:46] our daily bread in Jesus name we pray
[22:48] amen revelations 10:1 and I saw another
[22:52] mighty angel come down from heaven
[22:54] clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was
[22:56] upon his head his face was as it were
[22:58] the Sun his feet as pillars of fire and
[23:00] he had in his hand a little book open
[23:03] that's what we're getting into there
[23:05] were Revelation chapter 5 but we got one
[23:07] little point we got to cover here and he
[23:09] said his right foot upon the sea and his
[23:11] left foot upon the earth and cried with
[23:13] a loud voice as when a lion roar then
[23:15] when he had cried seven thunders uttered
[23:16] their voices and when the seven thunders
[23:18] had uttered their voices I was about to
[23:20] write and I heard a voice from heaven
[23:21] saying unto me seal up those things
[23:23] which the seven thunders uttered and
[23:25] write them not in the angel which I saw
[23:28] stand upon the sea and upon the earth
[23:29] lifted up his hand to heaven and swear
[23:31] by him that liveth for ever and ever who
[23:33] created heaven and the things that
[23:34] therein and the earth and the things
[23:36] that therein are and the sea and the
[23:37] things which are therein that there
[23:39] should be time no longer but in the days
[23:42] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[23:43] he shall begin to sound the mists
[23:46] of God should be finished as he had
[23:47] declared to his servants the prophets
[23:49] now let's read Ephesians 4:11 what we
[23:52] were talking about last night in the
[23:53] Bible study seasons 4:11 and he gave
[23:58] some apostles and some prophets and some
[24:00] evangelists and some pastors and
[24:01] teachers what for for the perfecting of
[24:04] the Saints for the work of the ministry
[24:06] for the edifying of the body of Christ
[24:07] till we all now that's going to be till
[24:10] we all right see what this is till we
[24:13] all come into the unity of the faith and
[24:15] of the knowledge of the Son of God unto
[24:18] a perfect man unto the measure of the
[24:21] stature of the fullness of Christ and we
[24:23] may get into that a little bit today
[24:25] that we henceforth be no more children
[24:29] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[24:32] every wind of doctrine by the sleight of
[24:34] men and cunning craftiness whereby they
[24:36] lie in wait to deceive and we see that
[24:39] happening all you know around around the
[24:41] world now not just in the message but
[24:43] everywhere but speaking the truth in
[24:45] love may grow up into him in all things
[24:49] which is the head even Christ
[24:51] now what roll it back down this is the
[24:54] two part go back the other way right
[25:02] there all right look the knowledge of
[25:05] the Son of God now who's the headstone
[25:10] headstone the son of man mm right so we
[25:15] we have a part here that we play and
[25:17] then we have a part here you see the
[25:20] onion peel you see that we break him
[25:22] back to layer speaking the word in truth
[25:24] may grow up into him in all things which
[25:26] is the head even Christ which is the son
[25:29] of man now he built his church on the
[25:32] Son of God revelation will short - in a
[25:34] minute back down through the church ages
[25:35] and they were people that came to
[25:37] fruition because remember the faith of
[25:41] the father's is here so they had all
[25:43] these virtues working in their life
[25:45] that's not something new brother Brian
[25:47] didn't preach statue of a perfect man it
[25:48] was all a new revelation it was an
[25:51] updated version of what Paul and Peter
[25:52] had already experienced 2,000 years ago
[25:56] and then what was he doing though
[25:58] brother Branham was
[25:59] turning us back to what to where we can
[26:01] get to that mmm tweaking we can get back
[26:04] to that but speaking the truth in love
[26:06] may grow up and do him in all things
[26:09] which is the head even Christ from whom
[26:11] the whole body fitly joined together and
[26:13] I like this word compacted when you
[26:15] compact something you don't build a
[26:18] foundation I was reading the other day
[26:20] that was talking about the Key West
[26:21] where they were had a lot of sand they
[26:24] drilled down till they get to coral they
[26:27] keep building on that sand they drilled
[26:29] till they get to coral rock and then
[26:31] they what they compact that thing and
[26:33] then they what build their buildings own
[26:35] well that's what I see here that God is
[26:36] now compacting by that which every joint
[26:40] supplieth according to the effectual
[26:42] working in the measure of every part
[26:44] maketh increase of the body unto the
[26:48] edifying of itself in love you may be
[26:51] seeing the Lord add his blessing to the
[26:52] reading of the word but I like that
[26:54] scripture just continue reading because
[26:56] most of us preacher stop on he gave some
[26:59] apostles prophets and we have to verify
[27:04] our office I don't think we have to
[27:05] verify our office hey man I think God's
[27:11] one that verifies the office that's
[27:12] wondering when you're gonna bring it
[27:16] brother Bob came all by you from Mobile
[27:19] Alabama to bring me that water today he
[27:21] was supposed to be in mobile preaching
[27:23] today but but Nate McFerrin went down
[27:27] and say that okay but Nate yeah that's
[27:31] right he's learning Nate is in the back
[27:33] learning so Nate come flying through
[27:34] here and he's the cause of all this
[27:36] weather so y'all can whip him when you
[27:38] see him
[27:39] so I'm allowed to say in churches listen
[27:41] let's get our get a foundation again now
[27:44] this messenger Malachi 4 in Revelations
[27:46] 10 7 is gonna do two things now I'm
[27:48] gonna keep repeating it so you can
[27:50] understand that he said there was two
[27:52] things that he was supposed to do all
[27:54] right not not someone that he said one
[27:56] according to Malachi 4 he will turn the
[27:58] hearts of the children to the father's
[28:00] no we were talking about that the other
[28:01] day
[28:02] children what Pentecostal babbling
[28:05] babies back to this faith of the what
[28:08] early Pentecost not Pentecost 1906 not
[28:11] Pentecost not
[28:13] 18:12 we're talking about Pentecost back
[28:15] in a t-33
[28:18] 30 80 30 we see that that's when the
[28:21] Holy Ghost came and fell on what sons of
[28:24] God and they were what they'd already
[28:27] been tutored by God for three and a half
[28:28] years God himself in human flesh tutored
[28:31] them for three and a half years amen so
[28:33] the word fell on what they held and
[28:35] we're going to talk about that later on
[28:36] today because if the first church age
[28:39] matured that way the last church age has
[28:42] got a mature that way man because you
[28:44] got you alpha brian omega bride you've
[28:46] got everything in between but the Alpha
[28:48] Brian and Omega bride had so much in
[28:50] common because God was restoring back in
[28:52] Malachi he was restoring us at the end
[28:55] time back to the faith of what the
[28:57] foundation of the Pentecostal fathers
[29:00] alright but that was the foundation to
[29:02] grow upon like we were talking about
[29:05] here in Ephesians 4 that started our
[29:07] growth development when you got born
[29:09] again you just you just didn't become
[29:11] full grown in God all right you had to
[29:15] start as a baby you fell you got up you
[29:19] made mistakes you cried daddy daddy and
[29:21] in romans 8 as we've as we've been
[29:24] through many times before but according
[29:27] to my account for he will turn the
[29:28] hearts of the children to the father's
[29:29] too he will reveal the mysteries of the
[29:31] seven thunders in revelations 10 that's
[29:33] what we're getting ready to get into
[29:34] which are the revelations contained in
[29:37] the seven seals like we said times
[29:38] before for those of you they weren't
[29:40] here this is the seal this is not the
[29:42] seal this is the seal this is the seal
[29:45] that had this sealed okay and this was
[29:48] sealed so nobody could see what was
[29:50] inside okay so the seven thunders of the
[29:52] revelations contained in the seventh
[29:54] seal so when the seven seals break God
[29:57] will be able to speak or Thunder out a
[29:59] voice that will bring us revelation
[30:02] because revelation was sealed up you
[30:05] said no no yes yes man's sealed this
[30:08] thing up the look the founding fathers
[30:11] never taught that father son Holy Ghost
[30:13] was a baptism so who did that come from
[30:16] the devil that had this thing sealed
[30:20] amen
[30:22] done all right so he he had that thing
[30:24] sealed where we couldn't see it
[30:28] but this endtime messenger promised us
[30:32] listen this is our inheritance today if
[30:34] you're a child and daughter of God today
[30:37] I am reading I am the attorney that's
[30:39] reading your will of your father that
[30:42] died to leave you something it is not
[30:46] just baby form justification baby form
[30:48] sanctification baby form baptism my Holy
[30:51] Ghost we're talking about the headstone
[30:53] we're talking about mature people that
[30:55] you know you you look at Peter and Paul
[30:59] and they had contention you look at Paul
[31:03] and what Barnabas
[31:05] they had contention it wasn't doctrinal
[31:09] contention though it was misbehaving or
[31:13] a Barnabas didn't want to take didn't
[31:14] think it was time for Timothy to go with
[31:16] him so he said I'm not taking him the
[31:18] Bible said they had so much contention
[31:19] they had to leave so we're not talking
[31:21] we're just talking about personalities
[31:22] there we're not talking about revelation
[31:24] I remember I told you right here in
[31:25] Ephesians 4 speaking the truth in love
[31:27] may grow up in him which is the head
[31:29] even Christ that we be not children
[31:33] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[31:35] every wind of doctrine somebody comes in
[31:38] and preaches this and we believe this
[31:39] they come in and preach that we believe
[31:40] that I'm like brother Ryan said this
[31:43] morning
[31:44] he what he said he was going to be a
[31:46] little bit arrogant
[31:47] Ron bonnet arrogant that's why you need
[31:51] to listen to this because I don't think
[31:55] there's an arrogant bone in his body I
[31:57] think it's just truth because how you
[32:02] gonna hear that's what brother Joe asked
[32:04] last night about the fivefold ministry
[32:05] in them in the Bible study and that's
[32:07] what struck my attention he said it's
[32:10] the fivefold ministry for everybody like
[32:13] out in the denominational world yes it
[32:15] is but there's a there's a group that's
[32:19] predestinated to take me and you to that
[32:24] headstone because there will never a
[32:26] denomination take you to the headstone
[32:29] never will a denomination take you to a
[32:31] headstone
[32:32] amen sorry that's just the way it is my
[32:36] brother branham watch here it's the
[32:38] divinely revealed mystery truth of the
[32:40] seventh church age messenger that will
[32:42] take us on right here literally turn us
[32:45] back it'll be those seven thunders in
[32:48] Revelations 10 which are the revelations
[32:50] contained in the seventh seal it will be
[32:52] these divinely revealed mystery truths
[32:54] that literally turned the hearts of the
[32:56] children to the Pentecostal father is
[32:58] exactly so but consider this also this
[33:00] prophet messenger will be in this nature
[33:02] and manners were Elijah and John the
[33:03] people of this prophet messengers days
[33:06] is that me and you the people of this
[33:12] prophet messengers day now remember if
[33:15] brother Branham said it's gone from you
[33:17] then it wasn't those people sitting in
[33:19] the tabernacle at the time of this they
[33:23] got their truth they got their
[33:24] revelation under the Son of God in the
[33:26] church ages hey man
[33:28] but he's talking about something totally
[33:31] different the headstone the seals that
[33:36] was the only person that had the seal
[33:38] was Christ himself amen
[33:42] then all right Clarence Larkin didn't
[33:45] have the revelation of the seals yet he
[33:47] had an understanding of the seal amen
[33:51] so I brother Ryan said I mean I'm I
[33:54] agree with him 100% these people sitting
[33:56] in this church that's wanting an
[33:58] anointing there's people in this church
[34:00] that wants that wants an anointing on
[34:02] the outside these people in this church
[34:03] wants an anointing on the inside and
[34:07] they some sentient that ain't don't want
[34:09] neither one of them make believers
[34:14] unbelievers and true believers in every
[34:18] congregation and I hate to say that but
[34:20] the prophet of God I'll just quote him
[34:21] he said that but as brother Ryan said
[34:25] which one do you want you want something
[34:28] that will sustain you for 15 minutes or
[34:30] for an eternity
[34:32] you won't 15 minutes of fame you won't
[34:34] 15 minutes of wool or do you want what
[34:37] an eternal soul that speaks back to God
[34:40] then when God speaks that you say yes
[34:44] Lord and it doesn't matter if it comes
[34:46] from me or Reiner brother anybody like
[34:50] sister Rachel asked last night about a
[34:53] prophetess being a woman well yeah we
[34:55] listen to but they're not gonna come
[34:57] back here and preach that's the
[34:59] difference you understand you got your
[35:01] office but God can't speak to women
[35:04] brother Brown said if a woman's got the
[35:07] Holy Ghost said you can listen to her
[35:08] and get something okay man we just have
[35:12] our offices we got to understand there
[35:13] is an office that we fulfil that they
[35:16] can't be in this office like we're
[35:18] talking here right we were talking last
[35:20] night and this is just my belief I don't
[35:22] have a quote for it but brother Branham
[35:24] remember he fulfilled all file offices
[35:27] remember he was a prophet but remember
[35:29] he was a church age messenger prophet he
[35:31] was not this faithful ministry prophet
[35:35] but he fulfilled all five what'd he do
[35:37] he stepped back and gone well God sent
[35:40] him in other words he stepped forward
[35:42] and showed all five offices and how they
[35:46] worked to their perfection therefore we
[35:50] can now take what he says as being the
[35:53] Prophet messenger of the endtime being
[35:56] the head prophet no other prophets if
[35:58] him because you can have multiple
[36:00] prophets in a fivefold ministry but you
[36:03] can't have multiple church agent
[36:04] messenger prophets on the scene at the
[36:06] same time God only speaks to one man but
[36:09] he fulfil remember the the angel said do
[36:11] the work of an evangelist he took him
[36:13] right to the scripture and told him to
[36:15] do the work of an evangelist didn't tell
[36:16] him he was an evangelist but to do the
[36:18] work of an evangelist because it had to
[36:21] come through God to the major prophet
[36:25] into the minor prophets apostles
[36:28] evangelists pastors and teachers that
[36:30] all right say ma'am all right that's why
[36:32] I say it there brother Branham showed us
[36:34] how to fulfill every one of them he was
[36:37] our example but only the children whose
[36:43] hearts will be turned it's only the
[36:45] children
[36:46] who will listen all right so let's
[36:48] continue on we've been reading this
[36:49] number to faith 1953 cuz the one I want
[36:53] to show you a few things on the board
[36:55] and then that'll put everything together
[36:56] and we'll get the Revelations 5 it
[36:58] shouldn't take us too long
[36:59] number two faith nineteenth this is 1953
[37:03] I'll still like this quote there's a
[37:04] step up coming in the church now brother
[37:07] Owen was talking about he sees things
[37:10] yeah and brother Dale was talking this
[37:11] morning you must see si means to
[37:15] understand you must understand that
[37:17] there is there is something that's
[37:19] that's not going to happen that's
[37:21] happening it's working because remember
[37:23] God what God what does it reveals it and
[37:27] it makes it manifest by the time you see
[37:29] the manifestation God's already been
[37:31] through to two forms of bringing it
[37:34] revealing it and then making the
[37:36] manifest all right so anyway we're in
[37:38] that time of this right here there's a
[37:40] step up coming into church now see these
[37:43] things that you're now seeing are going
[37:45] to be just little things after a while
[37:47] some things are moving I say this by the
[37:49] power of the revelation of Jesus Christ
[37:51] whom I everyone in our doctrine or in
[37:53] our baptism we come to a place but
[37:56] there's some key that will unlock
[37:58] something here all right so that key you
[38:01] know what that key is your faith that
[38:03] gives your faith your faith in believing
[38:07] that you're hearing the Word of God amen
[38:10] number three let's go to number three
[38:11] here because I want to read this and
[38:14] then we'll then we'll read this other
[38:17] quote that we had last night that I that
[38:19] I pulled up for us to to take a look at
[38:22] questions and answers 1964 first
[38:24] Corinthians 13 says this when that which
[38:27] is perfect is come that which is in part
[38:29] shall be done away with so all these
[38:31] little things of jumping up and down
[38:33] like a kid hello this is what Ryan was
[38:38] so much this morning that anointing that
[38:40] you get just a little whew you know then
[38:42] it's over with so all these little
[38:44] things have jumping up and down like a
[38:45] kid trying to talk in tongues and all
[38:47] these other things when that which is
[38:49] perfect see I want you to see some if
[38:52] brother branham watch on a tape we were
[38:55] talking about last night if somebody
[38:57] interrupted him and brought a
[38:59] tongue or an interpretation sometimes he
[39:03] would acknowledge it
[39:04] sometimes he never acknowledged it one
[39:06] time why it was not in order
[39:09] Amen it was not in order alright I was
[39:13] looking the other day and and I want us
[39:14] to be sensitive to this and I want to
[39:17] say this with all love you know let the
[39:19] preacher do the preaching when brother
[39:21] Brandon would there was only about four
[39:23] times somebody interrupted him during
[39:25] all those services that interrupted and
[39:27] said something to him and it took him
[39:29] five minutes you can hear him on the
[39:30] tape it took him five minutes to get his
[39:32] spirit back leave it alone you're not
[39:34] the preacher what the preacher up here
[39:35] say hallelujah say man say glory to God
[39:38] but don't try to preach for the preacher
[39:40] you take him out of his anointing you
[39:42] move him over be subject to the
[39:45] anointing that's here I'm just saying
[39:48] that cuz it's not right to do it any
[39:50] other way
[39:50] alright so it says right here same thing
[39:52] these little we shouldn't grow me grow
[39:54] we should be grow we should be grown up
[39:58] and we do have today by God's help the
[40:03] perfect interpretation of the word will
[40:06] divine vindication then that word since
[40:10] part is done away with when I was a
[40:12] child I spake as a child I understood as
[40:15] a child but when I became a man I put
[40:18] away childish things
[40:19] a man I go to preach and then then don't
[40:22] get to these things he's talking about
[40:23] answering questions Oh Matt now let's
[40:25] read number four we were talking about
[40:27] last night brother they asked brother
[40:29] Branham questions and answers on the
[40:31] seals you just heard it just the other
[40:32] day with the Bride of Christ would the
[40:35] Bride of Christ have a ministry before
[40:37] the rapture sure that's what's going on
[40:40] right now
[40:42] see the Bride of Christ certainly it is
[40:45] the message of the hour so he is he has
[40:47] told us where it was that it's the
[40:50] message of the hour the Bride of Christ
[40:51] sure she's consist of apostles prophets
[40:55] teachers evangelists and pastors of that
[40:57] right that's the Bride of Christ sure
[40:59] she's got a ministry great ministry it's
[41:02] the ministry of the hour but it'll be so
[41:05] humble and man it'll be so so humble so
[41:10] now let's read number five
[41:13] and then we'll go back and and make a
[41:17] few comments number five tell me brother
[41:18] tell me my sister when what's the time
[41:20] now look I want to show you something
[41:22] too later on when we start with the
[41:26] chart the messages brother Dale is
[41:29] always bringing out the messages after
[41:33] the seals well I'm going to bring you
[41:35] the messages coming up to the seal
[41:37] because to me that was the foundational
[41:40] important that it was important for him
[41:42] to bring that before he brought the
[41:43] seals because we know one thing's for
[41:45] sure if he didn't bring Daniel 70 weeks
[41:47] and preach it correct then he couldn't
[41:49] preach the seals now he said that
[41:50] himself same way with you and I we can't
[41:52] understand it tell me my brother tell me
[41:54] my sister so he preached in 1960 priests
[41:56] adoption series when was the time that
[41:59] the sons of God was ever to be
[42:00] manifested outside of this time now I'm
[42:03] telling you this is your inheritance I'm
[42:04] reading your well alright when were
[42:07] there ever a time in the history that
[42:10] this manifests the time to deliver all
[42:12] nature nature the nature itself is
[42:16] groaning waiting that's what's happening
[42:18] right outside this door look at nature
[42:21] we've never had this many hurricanes
[42:23] this time of the year this late in the
[42:25] year and all these earthquakes and all
[42:27] this other stuff that we're going
[42:28] through why is it groaning because we
[42:31] are not where we're supposed to be when
[42:34] were there ever a time in the history
[42:36] that the that manifests the time to
[42:38] deliver all nature nature the nature
[42:40] itself is groaning waiting for the time
[42:42] of manifestation why before the
[42:46] atonement was made before the Holy Ghost
[42:48] was ever poured out before all the Old
[42:50] Testament on down there there couldn't
[42:52] have been manifestations it had to wait
[42:55] till this time
[42:58] that's 1960s leading up to the ceiling
[43:01] now look now all these things has been
[43:04] brought coming shaping up to a headstone
[43:06] to the manifestation of sons of God
[43:09] coming back and the Spirit of God coming
[43:12] into these men so perfectly until the
[43:14] ministry will be so close like Christ
[43:18] it'll join him in his church together
[43:20] hey man I believe that's where we're
[43:22] right now there's your inheritance if
[43:25] you ever wanted
[43:26] there's your inheritance we've come to
[43:28] the place that that we know we are all
[43:30] in different areas in different
[43:31] different levels but this is where we
[43:34] must end up that is our end result is to
[43:38] get the headstone Christ never preached
[43:48] a false doctrine right Christ never
[43:52] preached a false doctrine
[43:53] did he so if we're supposed to be so
[43:56] much like Christ like brother Ryan said
[43:59] you can call it bragging or whatever you
[44:00] want to he believes that we're in the
[44:02] place we ought to be we're hearing the
[44:04] correct Word of God
[44:05] so you better bleep you better believe
[44:07] that if you don't you need to haul it
[44:08] out of here find something else please
[44:14] me to find something else if you got
[44:17] something else well I'll go listen to
[44:19] the Prophet he just told you to listen
[44:20] to the ministry he just told you to
[44:23] listen the apostles prophets pastors
[44:24] teachers and evangelists all right and
[44:27] if he was sitting here today he would
[44:28] Amen the same thing and then is this the
[44:30] end of the time surge number six we will
[44:34] talk about this and then we'll get into
[44:35] what we're what we're talking about
[44:36] today this has all been background the
[44:38] mystery here is the mystery of mystery
[44:40] of Scripture it is previously hidden
[44:42] truth now divinely revealed we've read
[44:43] this before we're going to read it again
[44:45] but which is a supernatural element
[44:47] still remaining despite the revelation
[44:49] so we've went through and we'll read at
[44:51] the minute where brother Martin talks
[44:52] about it we've went through chapter 7
[44:55] church ages with like he said the
[44:56] revelation of the Son of God coming down
[44:58] baptism no eternal hell all the major
[45:02] doctrines that we've talked about but
[45:04] remember Paul says we've got to what
[45:06] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[45:09] of Christ let us go on to perfection not
[45:14] doing away with it building on it and
[45:17] then building on that foundation taking
[45:20] in sin though did vile Icke that word
[45:22] divine cuz there's only one person
[45:24] divine that's God himself he can only
[45:28] bring divine you and I can't bring
[45:31] divine but God can bring divine but
[45:34] brother mom said these divinely revealed
[45:36] mystery truth so in other words they
[45:39] come from a man they come straight from
[45:41] God Almighty and right here now divinely
[45:44] revealed but which still still after
[45:49] being divinely revealed there's a
[45:51] supernatural element remains under that
[45:55] revelation and to me I believe that's
[45:58] the seven thunders that we're talking
[46:00] about here that all right you believe
[46:02] that if you want to do you know what you
[46:04] don't have to but I believe that it's
[46:06] these divinely revealed mystery truths
[46:08] that will literally turn us back it will
[46:10] turn us back not back to not back to the
[46:13] son of Samuel and Peggy Dale but back to
[46:15] the what the son of God that I was
[46:16] supposed to be my brother Dale is
[46:18] talking about all we're doing is meeting
[46:20] up with what we should have been in the
[46:21] Garden of Eden we're just meeting back
[46:23] up with it and we're not meeting back up
[46:25] with it in heaven
[46:27] we're meeting back up with it right here
[46:29] I told them I'm telling you again I the
[46:34] the one of the greatest revelations is
[46:37] that we don't have to stand judgment
[46:39] that ought to make you happy that we
[46:42] don't have to stand in front of that
[46:44] judgment but everybody all denominations
[46:48] oh we got to go before that white throne
[46:50] everybody's got to stand before that
[46:52] white throne no you don't no you do not
[46:57] why because my advocate has already
[47:01] stood the judgment and if I stand there
[47:04] with him how can I be judged if he's not
[47:08] judged to me that makes me happy to me
[47:13] that's a revelation and it didn't it
[47:15] then there is a supernatural element
[47:16] underneath that then I'm not gonna have
[47:19] to go somewhere to get judged I'm judged
[47:21] right here right here I take my judgment
[47:27] with Christ he wasn't judged in heaven
[47:29] he was judged on earth
[47:30] he took my judgment at Calvary so I
[47:35] don't have to stand it I already been in
[47:36] the hell I've already been in another
[47:40] dimension
[47:42] it's what the prophets in 1st
[47:45] Corinthians 2 verse 7 says but we speak
[47:48] the wisdom of God in a mystery even the
[47:50] hidden wisdom which God ordained before
[47:52] the world
[47:52] unto whose glory here's glory no no no
[47:59] hold on our glory remember brother Brown
[48:07] said we are his victory
[48:09] we are his victory he went to Calvary to
[48:12] pay the price but unless somebody
[48:14] accepts it down here unless somebody
[48:17] what brings that same ministry back here
[48:20] in this dimension it's got to be in this
[48:23] dimension on another one all right which
[48:26] none of the princes of this world knew
[48:28] for had they known it they would not
[48:29] have crucified the Lord of glory but as
[48:32] it is written I have not seen nor ear
[48:34] heard neither have entered into the
[48:36] heart of man the things which God has
[48:37] prepared for them that love him but God
[48:40] has to reveal them but God has revealed
[48:45] them unto us by his Spirit for the
[48:48] spirit searches all things yea the deep
[48:50] things of God we read this yes that's
[48:52] Sunday for what man knoweth the things
[48:55] of a man save the spirit of Man which is
[48:56] in him even so the things of God knoweth
[48:59] no man but the Spirit of God so now look
[49:02] we have received not the spirit of the
[49:05] world but the spirit which is of God
[49:07] that we might know the things that are
[49:09] what freely given to us of God now folks
[49:14] the seals have been open everything's
[49:17] been given to us the book is open there
[49:21] is no closed book if there's a closed
[49:24] book you closed it if it was a closed
[49:26] book I closed it but that book that we
[49:29] see in Revelations 10 was Christ Himself
[49:32] bringing that open book so that you and
[49:35] I can understand not just words on a
[49:38] page a book is not all words on a page
[49:41] you are living epistles known in what
[49:45] read of all men when you go to Walmart
[49:51] do you show this or do you show the
[49:55] things of the world which things also we
[49:59] speak not in the words which man's
[50:01] wisdom teacheth but which the Holy Ghost
[50:04] teacheth comparing spiritual things
[50:06] with spiritual I'll promise you I can
[50:11] stand here today and give you the
[50:14] commentary of Gemini's 38 years together
[50:17] some of you it would sicken you and some
[50:20] of you it would make you happy but I'll
[50:23] promise if you get in the same spirit of
[50:25] the one that was involved you'll
[50:28] understand it better so if you'll get in
[50:31] the spirit of the one that wrote it I
[50:35] see that more than ever sister Johnny I
[50:38] can't understand this word of God unless
[50:40] Stace the person that wrote it is inside
[50:42] of me same with you you cannot
[50:45] understand sure you can get superficial
[50:48] you can have the anointing like brother
[50:49] I was talking about you got the
[50:51] anointing on your spirit every day your
[50:52] life and dying to bust hell wide open
[50:54] you've said in a message Church sorry
[51:02] you'd be a sanctified as Judas was and
[51:06] still worthy go but the natural man
[51:10] receiveth not the things of the Spirit
[51:12] of God we're contrary our first life was
[51:16] contrary to this new life that's why
[51:18] they Paul said we listen you and I
[51:21] didn't have a worry in our members
[51:22] before we became Christians we just did
[51:24] what the inside man said but now that we
[51:30] become Christians there's like brother
[51:31] Dale said he never liked beer ever but
[51:33] now that you become a Christian you like
[51:38] why because it's that man inside of you
[51:43] has no one of that but that outside man
[51:47] still has a what a nature that we gotta
[51:50] find and we will fight that thing I
[51:53] promise you we'll win because the one
[51:55] greater is He that's in me than he
[51:57] that's in the world
[51:57] hey ma'am so that's the same way with
[51:59] you and I so look but the natural man
[52:01] receiveth not the things of the Spirit
[52:03] of God for they are foolishness unto Him
[52:05] neither can he know them because they
[52:09] are spiritually discerned this message
[52:12] even in its baby form is hard for people
[52:15] to understand even though it's plain
[52:19] even though it's something you just read
[52:21] in the Bible because when we read it
[52:23] remember we read it and let don't get me
[52:26] wrong you know when you were a new
[52:29] convert you didn't have the Holy Ghost
[52:31] you didn't have the teacher inside of
[52:33] you but he was so close
[52:35] God knows whether you gonna receive the
[52:37] Holy Ghost or not he knows whether you
[52:40] gonna continue own we see so many they
[52:42] come and they go man this is great this
[52:44] is great this is good this is well maybe
[52:47] it's not for me and then well God knew
[52:50] that he just let the person run the
[52:54] course but you and I but it's like
[52:57] brother Dale said many times of the the
[53:00] one that comes in and sets on the front
[53:01] row and shouts and screams hallelujah
[53:03] it's like a house on fire on a windy day
[53:04] well guess what six months later they
[53:06] just burn right on out but the person
[53:09] that comes in and sets and listens and
[53:11] listens and listens and listens and
[53:12] listens and hangs around for about a
[53:14] year or so
[53:15] I'll give them a little bit of credit
[53:17] hey man
[53:18] because what God's working on people
[53:21] he's working on him he's even working on
[53:23] the ones that don't want him right he's
[53:26] working on he's not he's not just
[53:29] kicking people out he said no come on in
[53:30] come on in sit down listen but one day
[53:36] he'll say you walked in a church and you
[53:37] turned me down so there's the righteous
[53:41] judge all right so now where is this
[53:43] message coming from and going to
[53:47] that's what we're gonna tie everything
[53:48] together just for a few minutes all
[53:50] right
[53:51] so let's go to number seven the breach
[53:52] between the church ages in the seals
[53:55] 1963 brother Graham says until we read
[53:57] this last week and we know this but I'm
[54:01] solidifying the foundation I'm
[54:03] compacting it to keep the crash you know
[54:06] from something falling through the
[54:07] cracks now see the mystery of the
[54:09] seventh seal book will be revealed at
[54:11] the sounding of the seventh Church ages
[54:14] church SEP sorry seventh church angels
[54:18] message saying the seventh angel begins
[54:21] to sound and there's the message wrote
[54:23] out there and we got it in tape and book
[54:25] for them he told them right where it was
[54:27] that
[54:28] plain as day but how many people caught
[54:32] that that we're sitting there probably
[54:34] not meaning because of what happened
[54:36] afterwards you look at you look at what
[54:38] happens afterwards because what you'll
[54:41] manifest who you are we're gonna
[54:42] manifest who we are what I said the
[54:44] other day you can you know we can say
[54:46] whoever about whatever but when it comes
[54:48] to manifesting time we will manifest who
[54:50] we are whether we want to or not you
[54:53] will manifest what's inside of you all
[54:55] right so now let's read this right here
[54:56] number eight we were talking last Sunday
[54:59] right here and this is where we'll just
[55:01] bring a few points and then we'll start
[55:03] in Revelation chapter five next Sunday
[55:04] now God has provided and original ways
[55:08] to do things and he'll never do it
[55:10] contrary to that that's why I like about
[55:12] God he's just constant and consistent
[55:14] he's constant inconsistent now he
[55:16] promised in the last days where we at
[55:19] now last day so put yourself in this
[55:21] quote that forty would do and it sent
[55:24] them us the message and this message
[55:26] would have the same identification
[55:28] there's Elijah hat as you lost your head
[55:30] as John the Baptist head and it will
[55:32] turn the hearts of the people not to the
[55:34] denomination but back to the original
[55:37] apostolate fathers back to the word how
[55:40] these things have been a vindicated how
[55:42] that in the sounding of the last angel
[55:44] revelations 10 and the days of the
[55:46] seventh angel these mysteries that's all
[55:48] been why did the message let's do this
[55:50] in the Baptist in the Church of Christ
[55:51] and Jehovah Witness all do that these
[55:54] mysteries will be revealed in the last
[55:56] day when the seven angels seven angels
[55:59] message when he not when he starts out
[56:01] doing this but when he begins to sound
[56:04] his message see not the years in
[56:07] preparation but you can't do away with
[56:09] the years of preparation no that's your
[56:12] foundation amen but that wasn't his
[56:15] message he come at the end of the age to
[56:20] bring his message he he preached to
[56:23] those baby Pentecost first part of his
[56:26] message to turn them around but that
[56:29] second part was not for them that was
[56:32] the shot that died had life in it before
[56:35] it I don't forget that like brother Owen
[56:37] said don't forget that shot one time had
[56:38] life
[56:39] protected the seed but God moves right
[56:43] on into the seed and the shut drives up
[56:45] and blows away that's what we see now
[56:47] not in the years of preparation but when
[56:50] he begins to sound the message these
[56:52] mysteries then will be revealed and here
[56:54] they are not knowing them and you people
[56:57] are a witness of it so he he put it
[57:00] pinned it right on him he said you're
[57:01] the witness all right so he says not in
[57:04] the years of preparation now we're gonna
[57:08] draw out here again and want you to see
[57:10] something and keep you awake maybe
[57:14] anyway now remember this is the this is
[57:21] the church ages all right now watch
[57:27] that's the church ages one through seven
[57:30] just like you got up here now what was
[57:32] he doing was and this was that this was
[57:35] a revelation of what son of God we know
[57:37] that on this rock I'll build my church
[57:40] this is the church this is the church
[57:44] he's talking about cuz remember brother
[57:46] Branham a little bit later on he pulls
[57:49] away from calling everybody a church
[57:51] because the church goes through the
[57:53] tribulation the bride don't go through
[57:56] the tribulation all right so the bride
[57:58] has to be called out of these ages
[58:00] remember he put the the black and you
[58:04] know he said the white was what the
[58:07] white was the believers and the black
[58:09] was the unbelievers and and remember the
[58:12] angel blacked us completely out he said
[58:15] I added a little bit of light you know
[58:19] where that light is it's like that comma
[58:21] that William bore the one you know what
[58:22] that light was mark haxon wrong way Dale
[58:27] be Caterson all of you that's the light
[58:29] he put up there because we have received
[58:32] that message everybody does
[58:33] everybody's not going to receive it and
[58:34] the ones that don't they're black
[58:36] they're black and out amen
[58:41] so now we got seven church ages and then
[58:43] we remember we were talking bringing it
[58:45] up as this that's horrible but that was
[58:51] that gap when that was the breech well
[58:53] during that
[58:53] I want you to see that even though
[58:55] that's what I was looking at this
[58:57] morning in birth pains number nine
[59:00] brother Branham says notice quickly now
[59:01] now she is in that stage beyond a shadow
[59:04] of a doubt we're in the Laodicean Church
[59:06] age so we're still at listen the way out
[59:10] of seeing church age actually continues
[59:12] on when we're gone if you won't be real
[59:18] technical as far as time continues even
[59:20] into the Millennium but that's not the
[59:21] Laodicean Church age all right time
[59:24] doesn't end until the what till we get
[59:26] to the future home all right but the
[59:28] church age ends when we get out of here
[59:30] and God goes to the Jews and then
[59:32] everything is destroyed that okay
[59:34] because because the church ages to the
[59:36] wise the Gentile all right
[59:37] does everybody understand that so it
[59:39] doesn't stop when we leave we're what
[59:42] we're calling out of the age remember if
[59:44] you'll look at your Daniel 7 do we chart
[59:46] brother Branham draws those little dots
[59:48] that's the church leaving the earth
[59:51] going right to and you know what he does
[59:54] he brings that God and he brings it
[59:55] right to what the headstone because
[59:58] that's what's going in a rapture this is
[1:00:01] not someone has to come to here to pull
[1:00:04] all this out to pull all this up to get
[1:00:08] us to what condition let me tell you
[1:00:14] something again I'm not looking for a
[1:00:16] rapture let me put you let me give you
[1:00:20] let me give you a real good example when
[1:00:23] I graduated high school I finished
[1:00:26] really 13 years kindergarten I just I
[1:00:30] didn't miss a grade kindergarten through
[1:00:33] 12 then I got a what on that graduation
[1:00:37] day I got a diploma that diploma says
[1:00:40] you're finished with this school and
[1:00:41] don't come back here anymore I didn't go
[1:00:43] back there the next year I was finished
[1:00:45] I was what I was called up out of that
[1:00:48] time but what was the most important
[1:00:51] that piece of paper or the 12 years I
[1:00:54] took a school that's your rapture the
[1:00:59] most important is to what the background
[1:01:03] the background is your important when
[1:01:05] the rapture is just an event that
[1:01:07] happens at the end of your required time
[1:01:11] on earth that all right say ma'am so to
[1:01:15] me the rapture sure it's very important
[1:01:16] I needed that diploma to continue on
[1:01:18] what I was doing
[1:01:20] but that one diplomacy I could have this
[1:01:22] is this is the whole point
[1:01:24] I could have skipped my graduation they
[1:01:26] could have mailed me my diploma but I
[1:01:28] couldn't have skipped 12 years of school
[1:01:29] and then got a diploma I had to go
[1:01:34] through those 12 years of school 13
[1:01:36] years of school and then they said okay
[1:01:38] you're ready to go so that's what God
[1:01:40] said you got to finish this required
[1:01:41] course then this is what this is a
[1:01:44] benefit of you taking all of your
[1:01:46] courses so the rapture is a benefit that
[1:01:48] we come to a place that we got to get to
[1:01:50] dead Saints out of the ground first
[1:01:52] people will not go one place without
[1:01:54] getting those dead Saints back into this
[1:01:57] dimension birth pains notice quickly now
[1:02:04] she's in that stage beyond a shadow of a
[1:02:08] doubt we're in the layout of scene
[1:02:09] churchy
[1:02:09] now her messenger is promised in Malachi
[1:02:12] the fourth chapter he's promised to do
[1:02:15] it and the message is to bring back the
[1:02:18] word bring the people back to the word
[1:02:21] birth is to be she's to be delivered of
[1:02:24] a new birth from according to Malachi 4
[1:02:27] now many people take that as he changed
[1:02:31] the way you got born again he can't
[1:02:33] change the way you get bored again he's
[1:02:37] a word prophet he had to bring it out of
[1:02:38] the word right so he couldn't bring out
[1:02:42] the word that now let's just believe the
[1:02:43] message of the hour no you still got
[1:02:46] justification because look in the future
[1:02:49] home he preaches the three stages
[1:02:53] completes the birth right justifications
[1:02:56] thanks for catching us but we're to be
[1:02:59] delivered of a new birth we get the new
[1:03:03] birth were delivered from a lot of
[1:03:05] things but they still some other things
[1:03:07] that we got to get out remember there's
[1:03:09] a birth into this there's a birth into
[1:03:11] this there's a birth into this is the
[1:03:13] birth into this and then we come up to
[1:03:14] right here we come up to that gap
[1:03:16] that we were talking about the breech
[1:03:19] listen your new birth is not wrong but
[1:03:23] your new birth if he doesn't carry you
[1:03:26] known to what the perfecting of the
[1:03:28] Saints in the headstone according to
[1:03:31] Ephesians 4 then what you're stuck
[1:03:36] you're stuck in the birth canal you
[1:03:39] can't get out
[1:03:40] never brother Brown said these people in
[1:03:42] these church ages couldn't get all the
[1:03:45] way out amen
[1:03:47] but in this time right here this Malachi
[1:03:50] 4 message is going to Burke a group of
[1:03:53] people that's not going to go back to
[1:03:55] tradition that's not going to go back
[1:03:57] even to the tradition of 1960s
[1:04:04] we've moved past not brother branham's
[1:04:09] message no no no no no but we've moved
[1:04:13] past that denominational idea that we
[1:04:16] don't have to all die every denomination
[1:04:24] teaches you you gonna die right that's
[1:04:30] why this is not a denomination this is
[1:04:35] not and will not be a denomination it
[1:04:38] cannot be denominated because what a
[1:04:41] denomination binds you
[1:04:44] it stops you Pentecost was wonderful it
[1:04:50] stopped
[1:04:51] what do brother Brahim say God went on
[1:04:55] the ship dried up why when there's no
[1:04:58] wife to shut dries up it blows away
[1:05:02] that's what's happening now we've got
[1:05:05] people still stuck in the church ages
[1:05:07] I'm sorry with church age mentality I
[1:05:10] got a guy I got a list I got a letter
[1:05:13] we're in the headstone is death Jesus
[1:05:18] had to die simply for me and you he
[1:05:20] didn't have to die for itself he died
[1:05:23] for us
[1:05:24] he took on CNN so weed it won't happen
[1:05:28] if we ever get it we don't have to die
[1:05:33] we've already done
[1:05:39] we're being delivered of a new birth
[1:05:42] from according to Malachi 4 bring in
[1:05:45] what the headstone back into the church
[1:05:50] listen to this see if you can take this
[1:05:55] one let's not read that quote yet just
[1:05:58] hang on men but look now we've come to a
[1:06:01] place anybody all right say man we got
[1:06:06] just just 10 minutes
[1:06:08] we got a gap here right because then you
[1:06:14] got what you got the headstone because
[1:06:16] it was rejected in the church ages so he
[1:06:19] was out of his church ages he was
[1:06:21] rejected in the church agent remember I
[1:06:23] got a cot I couldn't pull it up because
[1:06:25] they don't have the fix back there but
[1:06:26] write it if there's layout to see in
[1:06:28] church age he's kicked out he's been
[1:06:30] kicked out of every one of these Church
[1:06:31] ages he's standing at the door knocking
[1:06:33] waiting for us to lady man
[1:06:36] so in other words he's been kicked out
[1:06:38] of all my church ages and 90% of the
[1:06:41] message churches well it hurts but I
[1:06:44] really don't care
[1:06:45] not everybody is going to come to the
[1:06:48] headstone that's just the way it is I'm
[1:06:51] sorry but you got to have the right
[1:06:53] teaching to get you to that you can't be
[1:06:56] stuck in those church ages but look
[1:06:59] watch 1960 brother Branham preaches the
[1:07:05] adoption series I want you to watch how
[1:07:07] God brings this up cuz I told him last
[1:07:13] night every message brother Branham
[1:07:15] preached was God sent God ordained and
[1:07:20] God's one it did the preacher
[1:07:22] we need all 1,100 sermons to get us out
[1:07:26] of here
[1:07:26] so there wasn't that he preached one
[1:07:29] just to fill in a gap
[1:07:31] sometimes we preach sometimes and we
[1:07:33] think well we just fill the gap in today
[1:07:35] because nobody said they meant but it
[1:07:37] went to somebody because God's Word
[1:07:39] won't return void we smiling for a
[1:07:41] bubble Bob did good job Wednesday night
[1:07:43] dude laid it out there buddy I mean laid
[1:07:46] it out there didn't call no names but he
[1:07:50] should him 1960 watch he preaches what
[1:07:59] the church ages all right there by all
[1:08:03] right all right preaches the church ages
[1:08:06] puts them all in order remember the
[1:08:09] church age book doesn't come out till
[1:08:10] later it's a compilation of all the of
[1:08:13] the seven churches plus the ten virgins
[1:08:15] and all the other ones that he did he
[1:08:18] preached all right got that preached
[1:08:20] Church ages in 1960 I want to get this
[1:08:24] order down in 1211 so at the end of the
[1:08:26] year he was preached in 1963 Church ages
[1:08:29] all right now in 1961 he preached his
[1:08:34] Daniel 70 weeks in July everybody got
[1:08:39] that watch he comes through the church
[1:08:42] ages he said no we got to get these
[1:08:44] Daniel 70 weeks out of the way no we're
[1:08:46] still right here we're in that birth
[1:08:49] canal we're getting ready to be
[1:08:52] delivered
[1:08:54] because remember Malachi 4 has two parts
[1:08:56] the first part and the second part
[1:08:59] they're by all right first part in the
[1:09:02] second part now 1961 he preaches daddy
[1:09:07] I'm 70 weeks
[1:09:08] he said we got to get these out of the
[1:09:09] way now watch this in 1962 he preaches
[1:09:14] spoken words original seeds one of the
[1:09:16] greatest messages I think he ever
[1:09:17] preached but what did he do during that
[1:09:19] message what did he do during that
[1:09:25] message pulled it up on screen Polk
[1:09:29] Awards Regency 1962 he preached that in
[1:09:32] in March so let's put this date down 318
[1:09:35] that's March the 18th 1962 he said now
[1:09:39] look God has promised
[1:09:40] be careful God has promised Malachi for
[1:09:43] for this day and Malachi for has not yet
[1:09:47] been fulfilled but it must be fulfilled
[1:09:51] for it is a germanized Word of God
[1:09:55] spoken through Malachi the Prophet Jesus
[1:09:59] referred to it it is the to be just
[1:10:02] before the coming of Christ the second
[1:10:04] coming listen close now all scripture
[1:10:07] has not been yet fulfilled must be
[1:10:09] before that time the Bible is to be
[1:10:12] finished to be finished the Gentile
[1:10:13] dispensation is to be finished with the
[1:10:15] church age when this anointed messenger
[1:10:18] arrives now wait a minute he's been on
[1:10:20] the same for 30 years
[1:10:22] that's 1962 he started preaching in 133
[1:10:27] thirtysomething he's been preaching for
[1:10:29] thirty years he said as of yet that
[1:10:30] messenger is not here okay the Gentile
[1:10:37] dispensation is to be finished with the
[1:10:40] church age when this anointed messenger
[1:10:42] arrives of course he will plant the seed
[1:10:46] of the entire Bible plump from the
[1:10:49] serpent to the messenger in the form of
[1:10:51] rain obviously then he will be rejected
[1:10:54] by the denominational people as his
[1:10:56] forefathers John and Elijah as we're
[1:10:58] spoken by our Lord so on 3:18 1962 god
[1:11:03] this is the part that God put on his pen
[1:11:05] to write the Holy Spirit put this on his
[1:11:09] pen to write as of yet Malachi 4 had not
[1:11:12] been fulfilled now he had preached what
[1:11:15] adoption church ages

[1:11:21] back in this part of his ministry Tony
[1:11:25] was finished he was only beginning the
[1:11:31] Holy Ghost said wait a minute
[1:11:34] you're not even started your message yet

[1:12:28] perfect man he had to preach that to get

[1:14:11] foundation look we had to learn about
[1:14:14] adoption put the church ages in line put
[1:14:17] Daniel seventy weeks in line folk and
[1:14:19] words original seed brother branham your
[1:14:21] message is not finished son it's just
[1:14:22] beginning
[1:14:23] you got you got hey look from 318 1963
[1:14:32] to 12 about 20 when he preached
[1:14:36] communion I couldn't find couldn't look
[1:14:37] it up that's in 1965
[1:14:40] of course he died on the what the 24th
[1:14:42] right that's three years in nine months
[1:14:45] that's the three and a half year
[1:14:47] ministry Jesus Christ
[1:14:50] there's your message right there that's
[1:14:55] the message of the headstone so as of
[1:15:00] yet Malachi 4 has not been fulfilled but
[1:15:04] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:15:06] angel when he shall begin to sound you
[1:15:10] said no no no I'm just telling you what
[1:15:12] he said we're up here now we got to be
[1:15:16] called out of the ages you know what we
[1:15:18] got to do we got a door with a doorknob
[1:15:21] on our side we either leave it shut and
[1:15:26] staying here and dying go by the grave
[1:15:29] or we can open that door and let him in
[1:15:32] cause he's standing at the door let's
[1:15:35] stand our feet behold I stand at the
[1:15:42] door and I'm knocking look at that
[1:15:46] perfect that ministry just led us right
[1:15:49] into the headstone and you know what but
[1:15:53] Larry Christ had to come he had to come
[1:15:58] during that time why cuz everything was
[1:16:00] in perfect order just like now people we
[1:16:05] got to have everything in perfect order
[1:16:07] and I believe we are getting there to
[1:16:13] get everything in perfect order to get
[1:16:16] out of here
[1:16:18] let's sing a song if you need anything I
[1:16:20] hope that helped you a little bit maybe
[1:16:27] because remember a prophet doesn't do
[1:16:29] anything previously he does he does
[1:16:33] that's why he's a prophet he does what
[1:16:35] God tells him today so he's in there and
[1:16:38] he's studying these preaching spoken
[1:16:40] word getting ready to preach before its
[1:16:42] original seed and I'll guarantee you in
[1:16:44] his human mind he's going I preached
[1:16:48] this I preached this I brought the
[1:16:52] Daniel seventy weeks the way it's
[1:16:53] supposed to be I brought I went behind
[1:16:57] the curtain of time I've seen the sixth
[1:17:00] dimension I know where the people are
[1:17:01] that I'm preaching to if they die know
[1:17:04] where they're going I preached the
[1:17:06] church ages and and God's vindicated it
[1:17:09] by what growing the same thing on the
[1:17:10] wall what a vindication is histor for
[1:17:13] God to come down and draw the same thing
[1:17:15] you drew which it was God drawing it the
[1:17:17] first time anyway so we would we kind of
[1:17:20] well know that was brother right in line
[1:17:22] with God and then to have that
[1:17:24] vindicated and for us to come to a place
[1:17:26] now to where we can look back and see
[1:17:28] that and then we just walk right up them
[1:17:30] same step walk right up them saying
[1:17:34] there is no door except what we closed
[1:17:38] it's all open it's all for me and you to
[1:17:43] take this message and go right on into
[1:17:46] eternity with let's sing a song
[1:17:48] let's sing number 376 in the spiral book
[1:17:51] the original life
[1:17:53] God's heaven a buttes were manifested to
[1:17:57] his bride in this last stage we have
[1:18:00] caught the revelation by the last
[1:18:03] prophets message and we know
[1:18:12] for the original lives the original
[1:18:18] the original see the original
[1:18:23] is what I believe the son of mine
[1:18:29] revealed seven sealed
[1:18:31] BAM original I
[1:18:34] the original see we are the word made
[1:18:39] flesh today this what the scriptures say
[1:18:42] and our names are seen within redeemed
[1:18:46] and perfect without sin yes we are
[1:18:50] anointed
[1:18:51] [Music]
[1:18:56] the original
[1:18:58] the original
[1:19:01] the original shape the original world
[1:19:07] I believe the son of mine
[1:19:11] it's revealed a seven ceiling
[1:19:15] the original
[1:19:17] the original leaves thank alas what we
[1:19:20] are called to adoption gone
[1:19:24] [Music]
[1:19:31] sleep
[1:19:38] whose narrate
[1:19:41] there is it all
[1:19:43] the original see the original world
[1:19:49] it's what I believe
[1:19:50] [Music]
[1:20:20] [Applause]
[1:20:24] the original lies the original say we
[1:20:28] have been turned back to a place no one
[1:20:30] has been turned to you and I are
[1:20:32] standing in an inheritance that no one
[1:20:35] received God always had an inheritance
[1:20:38] but there's an inheritance of for you
[1:20:41] and I to have this second part of of the
[1:20:44] Prophet where it literally turns us
[1:20:47] badly it literally takes us out of here
[1:20:50] not just turn us back we should already
[1:20:54] be turned by it we should have the
[1:20:57] virtues working in our life at least
[1:21:00] some of them that's what I call is the
[1:21:04] first step but that's not the call today
[1:21:06] the call of today is the full
[1:21:09] manifestation of God the full
[1:21:12] manifestation of the one the headstone
[1:21:14] know what God says you love Lord and
[1:21:19] then all minds clear be careful going
[1:21:22] home
[1:21:22] I think it's lit up a little bit so just
[1:21:26] go with God
[1:21:27] read the breach if you would before next
[1:21:31] Sunday you don't get time to then we'll
[1:21:33] still start covering it but to me that
[1:21:35] was the foundation that that will help
[1:21:38] us I think as we go through then we'll
[1:21:40] come back and you'll know why brother
[1:21:42] Brown did some things see that's that's
[1:21:44] what I like about God if God can reveal
[1:21:49] it brother a if God can reveal it to me
[1:21:51] and the illiterate person really
[1:21:52] illiterate in the gospel I've been
[1:21:55] preaching but you know 15 years I'm not
[1:21:57] somebody's been preaching for thirty
[1:21:58] years and no ever closed during that's
[1:21:59] but if he can take somebody literate
[1:22:01] Percy brother a he's been in the message
[1:22:03] a long time but God still he still being
[1:22:05] what inspired he's still being what
[1:22:08] changed and something comes away and you
[1:22:11] go pan well you know what that does that
[1:22:13] gives me fuel for a little bit further
[1:22:17] then I get fuel for a little bit further
[1:22:19] and fuel for a little bit further so God
[1:22:22] bless you we got a fivefold ministry
[1:22:23] that works we got each one of you all of
[1:22:27] us together song leaders musicians
[1:22:30] you know if it if it's if it's better
[1:22:32] somewhere else let me know but I like it
[1:22:34] right here so the Lord bless you let's
[1:22:36] let's pray before we go the Heavenly
[1:22:38] Father we pray Lord that you'll go with
[1:22:39] your people take care of them on the
[1:22:41] highway the Lord just bless them be with

[1:23:02] journey as that's when the children of
[1:23:05] Israel were getting ready to go across

[1:23:08] that had to be circumcised there was one
[1:23:10] last group before they went across that
[1:23:13] they had to be circumcised before they
[1:23:15] went across and Lord we pray that you'll
[1:23:17] circumcise our heart just take those
[1:23:20] things away from us that we don't need
[1:23:21] Lord to give us a refill and give us
[1:23:23] that new birth from according to Malachi
[1:23:24] 4 that we can take this thing and sweep
[1:23:26] it onto the coming of the Lord just be
[1:23:28] with us now Lord to take care of us in
