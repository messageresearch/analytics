[10:03] way you know everything about it is so
[10:07] much cheaper insurance is like 80%
[10:11] cheaper than what he was paying you know
[10:14] and he seeing that and that's God's way
[10:17] of doing things that's just better all
[10:19] the way around not just in our finances
[10:22] but in every area of your life God's way
[10:25] is so much better and that's all our

[10:29] that his way is better he wants the best
[10:32] for you you know I want the best for my
[10:34] kids the best car that you can get cash
[10:37] the best one you see when you go in the
[10:40] devil's territory he like to make it
[10:41] easy and John and I talking about it
[10:43] because he went and got the loan he's
[10:44] like yeah Dad and they was telling me I
[10:46] can pay 80,000 for this just sleep on it

[30:21] going to ply the
[30:22] token Satan can't put his grimy hands
[30:24] through the blood he cannot do that he
[30:28] cannot put his Grimmy hands through the
[30:29] blood of Jesus
[30:31] Christ so we're going to apply the token
[30:33] to him and and watch him grow up and and
[30:36] be young men and and young sisters and
[30:39] if you get married stay here in this
[30:40] church you're not leaving so I know
[30:44] cleave and leave but you know there's
[30:45] interpretations there so I want to um

[31:01] a display and if Brothers will pull it
[31:04] up this is the website is called Vision
[31:10] books and there it is
[31:12] now voice of God has stopped producing
[31:17] books there's no print and press in
[31:19] Jeffersonville anymore they've sold all
[31:21] that the building's empty they're not
[31:24] printing anything It's All Digital and
[31:26] it's all electronic which is fine and
[31:28] dandy for
[31:31] some but for
[31:33] others less fortunate they need a
[31:37] book they need something to
[31:40] read and we're so fortunate to get it in
[31:46] English I mean you take 1100 sermons and
[31:49] put it in our home and it blesses our
[31:50] soul but you go take them same 1100
[31:53] sermons in English and put them in
[31:55] somewhere that speaks a different
[31:57] foreign language
[31:58] right
[32:00] useless the word's not useless the
[32:03] translation is useless so what brother
[32:05] Barry has done if you'll scroll it up
[32:07] just a little bit they're publishing the
[32:09] sermons what they're doing is they are
[32:12] coordinating with
[32:15] Cloverdale with the message Hub the
[32:17] message Hub has like huge database of of
[32:22] foreign languages so they come together
[32:25] so the process begins with the
[32:26] translation of sermons by the
[32:28] translators around the globe once
[32:30] translations are complete orders are
[32:32] placed for books to be printed
[32:35] offshore then they're shipped to
[32:37] countries for distribution by the local
[32:39] Ministry so the local missionaries and
[32:42] pastors give it out it's nothing that
[32:44] brother Barry does or anything from his
[32:46] church he's just
[32:48] facilitating and so brother Barry as the
[32:50] executive director or the leader of it
[32:54] he's Incorporated four brothers and
[32:55] those four brothers have come together
[32:57] in United States and Canada to put these
[33:00] books together now here's what I want to
[33:04] tell you is so astounding brother Barry
[33:07] coffee worked in the book industry so he
[33:11] had connections all over the world with
[33:13] printing
[33:14] books they're printing some in China
[33:17] they're printing some in the in the host
[33:19] countries that they're sending them
[33:21] to the Harvest is great but the labors
[33:24] are
[33:24] few so there's the current projects
[33:29] now you see it little green underneath
[33:31] that's how much money they've raised and
[33:33] how much money they
[33:37] need what if you didn't have a seal
[33:39] book what if you didn't have a church AE
[33:42] book those people that are standing in
[33:44] that line does not have
[33:48] one
[33:50] so it's astounding that they
[33:54] have put these
[33:56] books so some of those projects are
[33:58] completed and we're going to send them
[34:00] some money uh to help them but I want to
[34:03] lay this on your heart because it's on
[34:06] mine a small book a a a regular book
[34:10] like Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[34:12] or or anything like that any small book
[34:15] they
[34:17] can God's so good they can make that
[34:20] book for eight
[34:22] cents oh8 eight pennies they can make a
[34:27] book now seal book in a church age book
[34:29] Hebrew series anything thick is 86 cents
[34:32] a
[34:36] piece have you ever bought a book for 86
[34:40] cents and and have eternal qualities
[34:43] like these books will have eternal
[34:45] qualities to
[34:46] somebody so we're going to start
[34:48] supporting them now I'm going to lay
[34:50] this on your heart you pray about
[34:52] it we used to a long time ago the first
[34:56] Sunday of every month we had a mission
[34:58] offering everything that come in the
[34:59] collection plate went to missions some
[35:01] of the younger ones don't remember that
[35:03] but us older ones we remember first
[35:05] Sunday of ever month all the brother
[35:08] dick would announce it I can hear him
[35:09] announce it he say this is all going for
[35:11] Mission since we have two services on
[35:13] the first
[35:15] Sunday we're going to all the offering
[35:17] is going to go to Vision books all right
[35:22] now I want to ask you a
[35:25] question and I'm going to be a little
[35:27] comical but
[35:28] I would like for every family sometime
[35:31] during the month now not the week
[35:32] sometime during the month before that
[35:35] first week before that first Sunday find
[35:38] a way to put $20 fold it up and put it
[35:41] in your bill fold or your pocket and
[35:44] like I'd like for every family to put
[35:46] $20 in that time now if you want to give
[35:49] more that's fine if you want to give
[35:50] less that's fine but you're putting 20
[35:53] message
[35:55] books just by you giving $20
[35:58] here's the comical part I was thinking
[36:00] about you know you can't even go to
[36:01] Longhorn and get anything for $20 now
[36:03] hardly go to a drive-in or whatever
[36:06] McDonald's but take that $20 and and Sue
[36:10] don't go to The Waffle House oh no okay
[36:13] Donnie don't go to the wff house okay
[36:15] but take that $20 put it in your pocket
[36:17] and and go to Dairy Queen or Wendy's and
[36:20] get that $5 bag
[36:22] lunch I think it's $6 now but but give
[36:26] you a bag lunch stick that $20 in your
[36:28] pocket and then the first Sunday of
[36:30] every month put that $20 in the
[36:32] collection plate and that will go toward
[36:34] and the and obviously the church will uh
[36:37] also contribute but I think it's a it's
[36:40] for the
[36:41] cost you get your money's
[36:44] worth and look how they need they need a
[36:47] million books from Malawi and it was
[36:50] fully funded by
[36:52] somebody 5,7 Church AE books now how
[36:55] would you be without a Col a church AE
[36:57] book
[36:58] think about if you have a church AG not
[36:59] a church age book in your collection to
[37:01] read or to listen to quotes or to say
[37:03] that ain't nothing but the truth because
[37:04] I know because I read a church a book
[37:06] 5,000 Church AIDS books for
[37:10] Burundi it was fulfilled you can see
[37:12] that so if you'll scroll to the very end
[37:14] if you want to do anything extra if God
[37:16] puts it on your heart to do anything
[37:17] extra there's how to give go to the
[37:21] website if you don't have a QR Reader
[37:25] take a picture of that with your phone
[37:27] phone it'll tell you at the bottom what
[37:30] it is either PayPal cash app or zel you
[37:32] push that button and you can donate to
[37:36] Vision books but I think it's a worthy
[37:38] cause or you can mail a
[37:41] check for us residence only you can mail
[37:43] a check to that number right there if
[37:45] you want to just write a check and give
[37:46] it to them straight out but I would I
[37:48] would on the first Sunday of every month
[37:51] I'd like to see everybody put a $20 bail
[37:53] every family not everybody every family
[37:55] so you gather your family together and
[37:56] if you're single then gather yourself
[37:59] together and give
[38:00] $10 but you'll make 10 you'll get 10
[38:03] message books in somebody's hand
[38:06] overseas listen I love Electronics I
[38:09] love walking up here without 20 books or
[38:11] 30 books it scare you to
[38:13] death I got them right here but not
[38:16] everybody has access to this right here
[38:19] like brother J Hugh said yesterday he
[38:21] said how many brought their Bibles well
[38:22] some people didn't bring their Bibles
[38:23] they brought their tablets he
[38:25] said don't have to plug is in this stays
[38:29] charged all the time and I understand
[38:32] cuz I do the same thing I look up quotes
[38:33] and stuff on on the computers and all I
[38:36] understand that but I like a book and
[38:37] there's nothing else when they cut your
[38:39] power
[38:40] off your tablet's going to last about
[38:43] what hour
[38:45] maybe but them books
[38:48] won't so $20 if if you don't
[38:52] mind or more if you want to give but

[39:10] giest group in the
[39:12] world in the
[39:14] world you're the giest group versus how

[39:19] brother Ernie would tell you brother Joe
[39:21] Green will tell
[39:23] you per individual we give more to
[39:26] missions than any church that they know
[39:28] of now that's churches they know of cuz

[41:04] myself who's our worst
[41:06] problem the devil nope we are Our Own
[41:10] Worst Enemy but yesterday I was clever
[41:13] so I want to change the world I want to
[41:15] change everything oh if we could thank
[41:17] God we're not God today I am wise so I'm
[41:20] Chang you know God even being God he
[41:22] can't

[41:26] Bob said he he's he he's unchangeable he
[41:30] cannot be Chang and thank God that we
[41:31] can put that on look at the changing
[41:34] World out here changing all the time
[41:37] people shifting over on this way and
[41:39] shifting over on this side but the
[41:41] bride's real steady the bride should be
[41:44] real stable and real steady cuz we know
[41:46] a God that don't change we know a God
[41:49] that's seen this before the foundation
[41:50] of the world he knows what's going to
[41:52] happen he saw you make
[41:56] it well one more time he saw you make it
[42:00] through all that Journey he saw you make
[42:02] it so God loves you so do we we're going
[42:05] to speak today we're going to shift it
[42:06] over a little bit to the son of man at
[42:10] Pentecost transition to Perfection so
[42:12] we're going to stay on this for a while
[42:14] because we have been into the church
[42:16] ages now for half a year going from the
[42:20] first church age and now we're at the
[42:21] book
[42:23] end we're at the book end we there's no
[42:25] other Church age there's no other m and
[42:27] you are now literally living in that
[42:30] church age abely you get the good and
[42:33] you get the bad but we're living y'all
[42:35] all drove you lay to see a car to work I
[42:37] mean and you drove them here today
[42:40] right easy comfortable air heat brakes
[42:45] Windows some of them Drive their
[42:47] s but we use that but you know what we
[42:50] live in it but we're not of it that's
[42:52] right we've got to detach oursel from
[42:54] the world and get in this stay into
[42:57] Christ all right so that's what we're
[42:59] going to be speaking on now because
[43:01] that's there is a transition the first
[43:03] church age wonderful and we were talking
[43:06] about it yesterday brother randam said
[43:09] that the first church age should have
[43:10] took a Rapture they had everything in
[43:13] line they had everything going right
[43:15] they had no false Doctrine
[43:19] yet they should have took a Rapture but
[43:21] the full scripture had to be fulfilled
[43:23] that the corn of wheat had to go in the
[43:24] ground and die and abide alone in the
[43:27] church in the middle Church ages to come
[43:29] back up so that Luther would have a
[43:30] message Wesley would have a message
[43:32] Pentecost would have a message and then
[43:33] you're setting in the last message the
[43:35] eagle anointing message of the end time
[43:38] so we're going to transition now to
[43:40] Perfection because each one took a dip
[43:42] in the Holy Ghost but today I stand
[43:45] before you to tell you today we are at
[43:46] the
[43:47] fullness we are at the Apex we're at the
[43:51] Capstone this is the Capstone message we
[43:54] have arrived we have come to it and it's
[43:56] here for
[43:57] if we'll just yield ourself to it so
[44:00] we're that's what we're going to be
[44:01] speaking on now even through brother BS
[44:03] all his ministry it's a transition to
[44:05] Perfection cuz remember he allowed a lot
[44:08] of things during that Pentecostal first
[44:10] part of his ministry right he said you
[44:13] can't teach Pentecostal babies
[44:14] Supernatural things and can't teach them
[44:16] ABCs if they don't algebra if they don't
[44:17] know the ABCs but when he come up to
[44:19] those seals and come up to the very end
[44:21] from there to the end of his ministry
[44:23] that was a Perfection that had never
[44:25] been on the earth since Jesus Christ
[44:27] right cuz he was the son of man so now
[44:30] we are the son of man in the end time
[44:32] okay the word made flesh in a group of
[44:35] people let's bow our heads dear heavenly
[44:36] father thank you for this day Lord we
[44:38] appreciate the people we appreciate your
[44:41] presence we love the worship father and
[44:44] we thank you Father for giving us good
[44:45] song leaders good musicians and Lord
[44:48] everyone responding Lord with with feror
[44:51] that they they want to they want you to
[44:53] talk to them today Lord so I pray that
[44:55] you'd move me out of the way Lord and
[44:56] you speak to the people father give them
[44:59] Lord Supernatural hearing today that
[45:02] they can hear what the spirit says not
[45:03] what just an mortal man says but what
[45:06] the spirit says to the churches father
[45:08] forgive us of our sins and many mistakes
[45:10] Lord just be with us lead us and guide
[45:12] us bless the ones that are sick sister
[45:14] Johnny Sister Mary all the different
[45:16] ones Lord we call I pray that you'd
[45:18] bless each one father be with the ones
[45:20] that are watching in Lord that you just
[45:22] touch them Lord and and sister Audrey
[45:24] and different ones Lord that that need a
[45:26] touch from you father I pray that you'd
[45:27] be with them today Father just bless us
[45:29] in Jesus name amen so we'll go to Joel 2
[45:34] and it shall come to pass afterwards
[45:36] what's the afterwards the afterwards is
[45:37] the corn of wheat going in the ground
[45:39] pomor canor and all that eating the bug
[45:42] the bug eating the plant and it shall
[45:44] come to pass afterwards all right the
[45:47] restoration part that I will pour out my
[45:49] spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and
[45:51] your daughters shall prophesy your old
[45:53] men shall dream dreams your young men
[45:54] shall see visions and also upon on the
[45:57] servants and the handmaids in those days
[45:59] will I pour out my spirit 1 Corinthians
[46:03] 13:8 charity what is Charity that's the
[46:06] love of God that's Agape all right
[46:09] charity never faileth but whether there
[46:10] be prophecies they shall
[46:13] fail whether there be tongues they shall
[46:16] cease whether there be knowledge it
[46:20] shall vanish away for we know in part
[46:23] and we prophesy in part Paul was a
[46:27] prophet he could look through a glass
[46:29] Darkly he said I can see things but I
[46:31] Grievous wolves and he makes all these
[46:33] statements but he never saw the end
[46:35] because he had to be another Prophet a
[46:36] bookend Prophet William brandom in the
[46:38] end time but Paul Knew by the holy ghost
[46:41] that something was moving in that
[46:42] direction all right he just didn't know
[46:44] how long remember he was trying brother
[46:46] R said he tried to get them people to
[46:48] realize the Lord wasn't coming during
[46:50] that time he knew that he was looking
[46:52] and seeing something but when that which
[46:54] is perfect is come all right we're
[46:57] transitioning to Perfection but when
[46:59] that is perfect is come then that which
[47:01] is in part shall be done away now you're
[47:03] not going to do away with the foundation
[47:05] of this building right if you do we're
[47:08] all in trouble we're going to build on
[47:10] it but you're not going to go back down
[47:11] there and say now that's the foundation
[47:13] we know there's a foundation under this
[47:15] building so then build from there so we
[47:17] know there's a foundation in the
[47:19] Bible with the prophet's message let's
[47:21] build on it all right when I was a child
[47:24] I spake as a child I understood as a
[47:26] child it's not a problem being a child
[47:28] it's a problem staying a child I thought
[47:30] as a child but when I became a man I put
[47:32] away childish things in other words my
[47:34] thought process changed for now we see
[47:37] through a glass Darkly is that was
[47:39] saying but then face to face listen you
[47:41] and I brother John today are face to
[47:43] face with this message we're face to
[47:46] face with God and we're going to have to
[47:47] give an
[47:48] account if we do away with this message
[47:50] like many people have done but then face
[47:53] to face now I know in part but then
[47:55] shall I know even as also I am known and
[47:58] now B the faith hope and charity these
[48:00] three but the greatest of these is agape
[48:03] love or that headstone charity which is
[48:07] the son of man in the end time in human
[48:09] flesh called a bride you may be seing
[48:11] the Lord that his Blessing to the
[48:12] reading of the
[48:13] word but he had to start somewhere so in
[48:16] starting
[48:18] somewhere kind of I kind of froze there
[48:20] for a minute I looked the clock it was
[48:22] 11:42 I had this little little twitch
[48:25] but it's gone now so praise the Lord I
[48:28] got a big bottle of water and I'm good
[48:30] I'm ready to go I hope y'all ate a good
[48:31] breakfast most important meal of the day
[48:33] especially on Sunday Acts 2 verse1 and
[48:36] when the day of Pentecost was fully come
[48:38] they were all with one Accord in one
[48:39] place so God started his church that way
[48:42] all right he's going to fill them with
[48:44] the Holy Ghost and suddenly there came a
[48:45] sound from Heaven there a rushing Mighty
[48:47] Wind and it filled all the house where
[48:49] they were sitting there appeared under
[48:50] them clo and tongues like as of fire and
[48:52] it set upon each of them and they were
[48:54] all filled with the Holy Ghost how about
[48:56] 120 people at one
[48:58] whack like about this building plus a
[49:00] few more receed the holy ghost at one
[49:03] time powerful but God had to do that to
[49:07] get the church started so that they
[49:08] could what go out to the 3,000
[49:11] downstairs and those 3,000 could go out
[49:14] and you're sitting here today as a
[49:15] recipient of that experience on the day
[49:19] of Pentecost in the upper room you're
[49:21] sitting here today you're a benefactor
[49:23] of them receiving the Holy Ghost cuz
[49:24] without them receiving it you're not
[49:26] going to receive it amen all right so
[49:28] you receive the Holy Ghost just like
[49:29] they
[49:32] did may not have been with an emotion
[49:34] but you're going to have an experience
[49:37] the prophet of God said you're going to
[49:38] experience something and then you're
[49:40] going to move forward from that
[49:42] experience whether it even be
[49:43] justification or even sanctification but
[49:46] when the Holy Ghost comes that's the
[49:48] burner that burns all that out we were
[49:51] talking about that we may cover it again
[49:53] they were all filled with the Holy Ghost
[49:55] who began to speak with other tongues as
[49:56] a Spirit gave them others now for the
[50:00] some of the new ones we we have a a
[50:02] chart here this is the church agent
[50:04] we've kind of filled in a few things I
[50:05] say we dad did that me and him did this
[50:08] um years ago when he taught on the
[50:10] porter that's the red letters in there
[50:13] so what happened is when the first
[50:15] before the first church Aid started
[50:17] there was a day of Pentecost I just read
[50:19] it all
[50:23] right I'm not saying anything do you say
[50:25] Amen amen amen amen so there was a day
[50:30] of Pentecost there was no Messenger to
[50:32] that age though Peter was the spokesman
[50:35] he stood up and said men and Brethren
[50:37] you've killed Jesus and you've done this
[50:39] the determinant counsel and all these
[50:40] things and he said they said men and
[50:42] brother what must me do he said repent
[50:45] and be baptized in name you know
[50:47] yesterday brother Jason
[50:49] was you know expounded on that a little
[50:52] bit but you know what that still Thrills
[50:53] my
[50:55] heart that that I can read acts 238 and
[50:58] know what it
[50:59] says that I can read Matthew 28:19 and
[51:02] know that's what Peter said that ought
[51:05] to excit you that you know that cuz
[51:07] listen folks there's 8 billion people in
[51:10] the world today probably a billion of
[51:13] them are somewhat Christians they all
[51:16] baptized in the name of Father Son and
[51:17] Holy Ghost all of them except me and you
[51:21] and maybe a little spackling of other
[51:23] people but we understand and know that
[51:25] what Peter was talking about is the same
[51:27] thing what Jesus was talking about we
[51:30] know that and and to us it becomes
[51:33] common but it shouldn't become common
[51:34] when somebody reads reads a scripture
[51:37] that that we can tie ourself to you
[51:39] ought to say
[51:41] Amen if you don't see your name in every
[51:44] verse Christ in every verse I say see
[51:46] you in every
[51:47] verse you need to read it again but we
[51:50] had a Pentecostal age which came in like
[51:52] I said a I'm not zud street but ad30
[51:56] Jesus died came back on day Pentecost so
[51:58] they had a little time in there and then
[52:00] what did Paul Paul comes on the scene he
[52:01] gets the Holy Ghost and he starts his
[52:04] message he's a prophet he's not a
[52:06] reformer he's a prophet all right
[52:09] because God wanted his church started
[52:10] right so he did it with a
[52:13] prophet that's why God wants to end his
[52:15] church right he sends us a prophet all
[52:17] right not a
[52:19] reformer so then you come through here
[52:21] and you see all these Church ages and
[52:22] they're not exactly in the little round
[52:25] um holes we got there they lap over they
[52:29] connect to each other God don't just
[52:31] abruptly stop one age and start a new
[52:33] one they they actually overlap or just
[52:36] like these steps this one steps on that
[52:38] one well that one is connected to this
[52:40] one but it's not that step it's a
[52:41] different step but they're connected so
[52:44] those ages are connected all the way
[52:46] through but but to have an alpha bride
[52:50] and an Omega bride that's the two
[52:51] bookends that are to be the same all
[52:54] right everybody with me then if it
[52:56] started with the Pentecostal
[52:58] age it's got to end with the Pentecostal
[53:01] age right before the last Church age so
[53:03] the Holy Ghost came himself we'll read
[53:05] it later on where brother R tells us
[53:07] that on isusa Street 1906 when the Holy
[53:11] Ghost fell that was the Holy Ghost
[53:13] himself coming to restore the church to
[53:17] restore the gifts all right
[53:19] amen so now let's continue on so the
[53:24] upper room Jes Jesus told him said I
[53:27] indeed baptize you with water or this
[53:29] was John speaking but he that cometh
[53:32] after me is mightier than I whose shoes
[53:33] I not worthy to Bear he shall baptize
[53:35] you with the Holy Ghost and with fire we
[53:39] were talking about that yesterday you
[53:41] can receive the Holy Ghost on your
[53:43] spirit
[53:45] realm and be lost and go to hell that's
[53:48] so you can't say I got the Holy
[53:54] Ghost Judas had an anointing of the Holy
[54:00] Ghost and he was the son of
[54:02] predition he never got it in his soul
[54:05] like the 120 in the upper room I've been
[54:07] this message so I got the Holy
[54:10] Ghost no they ain't going to get you
[54:12] nowhere you got to be born again yes sir
[54:16] and you got to be born from above you
[54:17] got to take this nature that you've got
[54:19] and have God burn it out and nobody can
[54:22] burn it out but the Holy Ghost with fire
[54:25] now when he comes in with the fire and
[54:26] burns it out and then he resides inside
[54:28] of you guess what that makes you a born
[54:31] again believer that takes that Genesis 1
[54:33] 12627 man and puts that part that God
[54:36] saw you were can't change his mind
[54:38] remember that's right that piece a part
[54:40] of him that he saw came right inside of
[54:43] you yes sir and made you a son and
[54:45] daughter of God Amen bire you into the
[54:48] body of Christ now you're not a creature
[54:49] of the earth you're a creature of
[54:52] Heaven I hope y'all en I hope y'all
[54:55] understand that amen if you're not born
[54:57] again you need to get born again okay
[55:00] you need to be born from above now watch
[55:02] what brother B said look the future
[55:05] home he said I'm trying to get to you
[55:07] now watch he's going to do the Earth see
[55:10] it isn't going to just going to be
[55:12] another Earth that's why we don't
[55:14] believe there's some in the message do
[55:17] believe that this body is just going to
[55:18] rot away and we're going to get a brand
[55:20] new one now that's not what he's going
[55:21] to do to the
[55:24] Earth he's not going to do that to the
[55:26] Earth brother ROM prove that now the
[55:28] world thinks that the world thinks this
[55:29] place is going to be annihilated and
[55:31] we're going to sit on
[55:33] clouds me and brother Richard are going
[55:35] to be playing hearts together I don't
[55:37] think he can play one neither can I and
[55:39] I don't want to be sitting on the cloud
[55:40] for eternity I'd like to have my feet on
[55:43] some kind on something that is
[55:46] eternal so it will be the Earth your
[55:49] body will be redeemed the one the mom
[55:52] and daddy gave you will change in the
[55:55] atoms and you'll be changed in a moment
[55:56] in the twinkling of an eye there's an
[55:58] empty tomb over in Jerusalem there'll be
[56:00] an empty tomb right here your body's
[56:03] going to come out of that ground God
[56:05] thought so much of you he put you
[56:08] together amen he's going to keep you
[56:10] together sure it'll be young sure it'll
[56:13] be changed sure it'll be new but you
[56:16] become a new creation when you got born
[56:18] again but the Earth here he said it's
[56:21] going to be burnt off same Earth same
[56:24] elements just burnt yes sir
[56:26] and God's going to do the same thing
[56:28] with us at the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[56:30] he burns us off on the
[56:31] inside but there's going to be a day
[56:34] when this body is going to be changed
[56:36] there'll be a fire
[56:38] come hasten the day
[56:40] Lord that this body will feel that fire
[56:44] yes
[56:44] sir inside of our
[56:47] bones and those bones will change in the
[56:51] moment in the twinking of an
[56:53] eye well it's not a it's not a hope no
[56:56] sir it's a promise and if God said it he
[57:00] can't change his mind somebody just said
[57:03] that so in the future home that's why I
[57:05] love the future home give me that book
[57:08] because it tells the complete Plan of
[57:10] Redemption all
[57:12] right it isn't going to just going to
[57:15] have another Earth you're not going to
[57:17] have another
[57:18] body it's going to be the same Earth now
[57:21] what are
[57:23] you your Earth your body literally came
[57:27] out of this Earth yes sir your mom and
[57:29] daddy ate potatoes and beans and and if
[57:32] you're if you're a vegetarian that's all
[57:34] if not then we'll pray for
[57:36] you but meat that the cow died but what
[57:41] did the cow grow up with eating grass or
[57:44] eating corn that what came out of the
[57:45] earth so everything came why we call it
[57:47] Mother Earth what we get every all of
[57:50] our nutrients so Mom and Daddy had all
[57:51] the nutrients they got married they got
[57:53] together and then in that process there
[57:56] you are you're made of the same 16
[57:58] elements as your mom and daddy is that's
[58:00] right all right but now remember when
[58:02] you get born again though you get
[58:05] transformed into what into his kingdom
[58:08] are Sons and Daughters of God by the new
[58:10] birth inside that's why it's a secret
[58:13] amen it's a secret but you're going to
[58:17] express that
[58:18] secret you will Express what's inside of
[58:20] you I don't care what it is it's coming
[58:22] out folks
[58:26] was talking to I think I was talking to
[58:28] brother Bob yesterday you know if we are
[58:30] in the third everybody's going hollering
[58:32] third pole Ministry we're in the third
[58:33] pole we're in the very end do you know
[58:36] what the third pull is it's preaching to
[58:38] the totally
[58:41] lost someone sitting in your
[58:44] congregation I'm not saying this one I'm
[58:46] just saying ministers think about it
[58:49] somebody sitting in your congregation
[58:50] they can never be saved that's who we're
[58:51] preaching to now you better get in yes
[58:55] sir you better get in that Ark because
[58:58] if you don't get in the ark you're going
[58:59] to
[59:01] drown listen it's time to check up it's
[59:05] time to check everything up all the way
[59:08] from one thing to the next cuz God is
[59:11] going to do what he said he was going to
[59:13] do he saw a group of people come to
[59:16] Perfection that's right oh I don't see
[59:18] it in them we look at it in you
[59:21] first you want everybody else to conform
[59:24] to your image the only image I want to
[59:26] conform to is God's image that's all all
[59:29] right and where brother R stood we were
[59:31] talking about yesterday brother R stood
[59:33] and said I'm not the son of Charles and
[59:34] Ella brandham he knew there was another
[59:37] William brandham that had developed
[59:38] inside of him so much and you know he
[59:41] said that you know what he said
[59:43] it right before he
[59:46] died just a month before he died on
[59:49] leadership or communion he said I'm I I
[59:52] found out I wasn't a he didn't deny his
[59:54] mom and daddy
[59:56] but he had been transformed so much till
[59:58] he had a Heavenly family and the Earthly
[1:00:01] family just shed
[1:00:04] away thank God for our Earthly parents
[1:00:06] they're the ones that got you here all
[1:00:08] right but they ain't the ones going to
[1:00:09] get you there right because you born in
[1:00:12] sin was all born dead until we get the
[1:00:15] new birth all right now look I'm trying
[1:00:16] to get the Plan of Redemption to you if
[1:00:18] I don't get nothing else all right he's
[1:00:21] talking about us at a future home giving
[1:00:23] us Dimensions telling us where we're
[1:00:24] going telling them where it's going to
[1:00:25] be telling me it's streets of gold it's
[1:00:28] Paradise it's got rivers of water it's
[1:00:30] got all these great things he said I'm
[1:00:32] if you don't get anything get Plan of
[1:00:34] Redemption cuz the earth goes through
[1:00:36] the same thing you go through water
[1:00:39] baptism under
[1:00:42] Noah sanctification under Jesus shedding
[1:00:45] his blood and it dropping literally
[1:00:46] dropping on the
[1:00:48] earth and then the holy ghost coming in
[1:00:51] the end time with the fire to burn all
[1:00:53] that out yes sir praise God if I don't
[1:00:56] get nothing else the baptism of fire on
[1:00:59] it only is to cleanse it and make it a
[1:01:02] fit place for his Meek to live in oh
[1:01:06] like he did us his creation yes sir to
[1:01:09] live in yes sir God's not going to dwell
[1:01:11] in an unclean
[1:01:14] vessel now like what brother said last
[1:01:17] weekend he said you know he said your
[1:01:19] soul is sealed in by the Holy
[1:01:20] Ghost right you either got it or don't
[1:01:23] they ain't a middle ground in the soul
[1:01:25] that's right like white one of the two
[1:01:26] you either got the devil in you today
[1:01:28] working or you got God in you working
[1:01:29] but that next Rim we we spoke of this
[1:01:31] many many times but I like the way he
[1:01:33] put it he said that's your maintenance
[1:01:35] department all
[1:01:37] right you get your power from the inside
[1:01:40] but you got to maintain that with your
[1:01:42] what memory reason conscious effects and
[1:01:44] Imagination that's your maintenance
[1:01:45] department you maintain you maintain
[1:01:49] your spirit realm cuz you control that
[1:01:53] or you let the devil control it or we
[1:01:54] let God control it that's right amen
[1:01:58] well praise God anyway it's your
[1:02:00] maintenance department you I know some
[1:02:02] of you worked in maintenance if Aaron
[1:02:04] was here he works in different things
[1:02:05] brother Boyd listen they're the one of
[1:02:08] the most important people in the
[1:02:11] building if something breaks down it
[1:02:13] starts costing you money we called the
[1:02:16] maintenance department that's right and
[1:02:18] we didn't have to call them from 30
[1:02:19] miles away we usually had one in house
[1:02:22] that's right let's get
[1:02:24] one let's get one
[1:02:26] house well we ain't got to go look for
[1:02:28] it he's right there and he said oh no
[1:02:31] don't put that there oh don't look at
[1:02:36] that praise the
[1:02:39] Lord he had to give us the baptism of
[1:02:42] fire then the Holy Ghost come in and
[1:02:45] live baptism of fire in other words he's
[1:02:47] got to burn all that out before he'll
[1:02:49] come in that's right then when you get
[1:02:52] that baptism of fire then the Holy Ghost
[1:02:53] can come in what as it does it burns up
[1:02:57] everything contrary to the word out of
[1:03:01] you amen have we had that
[1:03:08] burning have we had that burning you
[1:03:10] know burning is burning is bad different
[1:03:12] in places but burning is really good
[1:03:14] when you burn off a piece of property
[1:03:17] right you burn all the underbrush and
[1:03:19] all the new starts coming up but
[1:03:21] remember it's a control
[1:03:23] burn an out of control burn is is not
[1:03:26] God God's never out of control I just
[1:03:28] got that thank you the Lord thank the
[1:03:29] Lord like California they got them
[1:03:31] wildfires and every that's what they're
[1:03:33] called some of you wildfires some of us
[1:03:37] wildfires but when the fire of God comes
[1:03:39] in he don't make you
[1:03:40] wild amen he makes you fervent for the
[1:03:43] word of God he makes you fervent for the
[1:03:46] people of God he makes you fervent to
[1:03:47] make sure you see that your brother and
[1:03:49] sister has everything they need amen
[1:03:53] from you yeah from you we're all sheep
[1:03:57] all right it won't believe nothing else
[1:03:59] but the word because it's the word we
[1:04:01] can't supersede the word if we do we're
[1:04:03] in iniquity that's right brother
[1:04:06] brandham first seal mystery of iniquity
[1:04:09] but the Bible says in the end time that
[1:04:11] iniquity will
[1:04:13] abound well I know that says that but
[1:04:15] I'm not going to do it that's iniquity
[1:04:18] that's
[1:04:20] right now that's what we were talking
[1:04:22] the other day the evidence of the Holy
[1:04:23] Ghost the evidence of the Holy Ghost all
[1:04:25] right you ready it's when you can
[1:04:28] receive the word not some system amen
[1:04:32] but have a what
[1:04:34] clear understanding right know who you
[1:04:38] are and what you're doing here amen
[1:04:40] Satan don't want us to know that but God
[1:04:42] does and he he will have a people when
[1:04:45] brother Bob was speaking this morning I
[1:04:47] thought well Lord if I stepped into your
[1:04:49] mind which just for a few minutes he
[1:04:52] knows everything we're going to do right
[1:04:55] ups and down ins and outs but to him
[1:04:57] that's
[1:04:59] nothing end of the
[1:05:01] road all right but remember I was
[1:05:04] thinking also this though we're a child
[1:05:07] of God though we're a son and daughter
[1:05:08] of God remember what brother R
[1:05:11] said this is how we can sin and not get
[1:05:13] by with it this is how we can sin and
[1:05:15] ask for forgiveness and God give he
[1:05:17] can't see
[1:05:20] us you want me to read you the quote
[1:05:23] brother Brown said he only hears your
[1:05:27] voice he said because one second in
[1:05:30] front of a holy God in our condition
[1:05:33] he'd have to do away with us so that's
[1:05:36] why we have that Advocate we have Jesus
[1:05:39] Christ in between that can go to the
[1:05:41] father not two
[1:05:43] people but that power is transferred to
[1:05:45] him and he takes it to the father and
[1:05:46] says they didn't they didn't mean to do
[1:05:50] that you hear them they're
[1:05:54] repenting repentance is good good for
[1:05:57] the soul
[1:05:58] am not some system but have a clear
[1:06:01] understanding how do you know the word
[1:06:03] is
[1:06:04] clear understand it watch it vindicate
[1:06:08] itself yes sir amen that's all you got
[1:06:11] to do watch it vindicate itself all
[1:06:14] right and listen I'm going to tell you
[1:06:16] something that's why we've been here 60
[1:06:17] years after the prophet
[1:06:19] left he's shaking the
[1:06:22] bushes ones are going to make it yeah
[1:06:25] the ones that are hanging around because
[1:06:26] remember what happened when they went to
[1:06:29] cadis
[1:06:30] barnea remember what happened when they
[1:06:32] went to the promised land only two
[1:06:35] people got the
[1:06:37] Revelation now the younger ones come up
[1:06:39] during the but they had to go through
[1:06:40] that Wilderness Journey they had to
[1:06:42] watch their mother and father
[1:06:44] die come on without cuz Hey listen what
[1:06:48] is our promised land it's the Holy Ghost
[1:06:51] we know that right and that's what we
[1:06:53] should be looking for but they were
[1:06:55] literally looking God said I'm going to
[1:06:56] give you this piece of property right
[1:06:58] here God said the Creator said I'm going
[1:07:01] to give you this piece of property go to
[1:07:02] it it's yours you may have to fight for
[1:07:05] it but it's yours it's your property and
[1:07:08] 2 million
[1:07:10] left and only two of the original made
[1:07:13] it AC
[1:07:14] cross brother BR said one in a
[1:07:18] million but the young ones that come up
[1:07:20] 20 and
[1:07:21] younger they watch their mom and dad die
[1:07:25] but they something in their heart said
[1:07:27] sister Regina I know there's a Promised
[1:07:29] Land I know there's a God I know Jehovah
[1:07:32] told my mom and daddy cuz they told me
[1:07:35] we weren't there we were weren't born
[1:07:37] yet but mom and daddy told me or or
[1:07:39] Moses told me or Joshua preached to me
[1:07:41] one Sunday is anybody listening to what
[1:07:43] I'm saying or somebody said something
[1:07:45] about my inheritance that's right and
[1:07:48] now Joshua and KB I know them back there
[1:07:50] said I don't I we can't do
[1:07:53] it but we're going to be like
[1:07:56] Caleb were more than able yes sir he
[1:08:00] started at 40 he was 80 years old so a
[1:08:04] doesn't matter he said I'm more than
[1:08:06] able he said I'm stronger now than I was
[1:08:08] back then why because he could see the
[1:08:10] Promise can we see the
[1:08:14] Promise we're living that close to the
[1:08:16] promised land
[1:08:18] folks that
[1:08:20] close I see this do it well you say I
[1:08:22] see this do it and oh yes weeds live the
[1:08:25] same way
[1:08:26] but it's got to be the entire word to be
[1:08:29] the bride you have to be part of him he
[1:08:32] is the word and what a part of him is it
[1:08:35] the word that's promised for this day
[1:08:37] yes sir he's calling a bride in this day
[1:08:40] he's not calling a Luther bride in this
[1:08:42] day he's not calling a Wesley or a
[1:08:44] Pentecost he's calling a mature bride in
[1:08:47] the end time to take this thing and get
[1:08:50] out of here with it
[1:08:56] like Brother Richard Wilson says just as
[1:08:57] sure as I'm standing here that's going
[1:08:59] to
[1:09:00] happen Ministry of Jesus 1953 you know
[1:09:04] what I done I buil me a little fire and
[1:09:05] said the old boy he's talking about
[1:09:06] something he done to a turtle I think it
[1:09:08] was or something he moved then what we
[1:09:10] need today is not Church joining and
[1:09:12] arguing about baptism just the Holy
[1:09:15] Ghost in fire that'll make any church
[1:09:17] move get the Holy Spirit back in the
[1:09:20] church and the apostles and teachers and
[1:09:22] so forth into their places and let the
[1:09:25] Holy Ghost go to reigning on a church
[1:09:27] like that and see what takes place signs
[1:09:29] and wonders and miracles will follow
[1:09:31] sure it will what a
[1:09:35] promise but I want to tell you back up
[1:09:37] just a minute when we started in Luther
[1:09:40] and Wesley remember they fall under the
[1:09:43] man
[1:09:44] anointing right everybody with me the
[1:09:46] liox man and
[1:09:49] Eagle brother Timothy Dodd was speaking
[1:09:51] on this last weekend and I mean he
[1:09:54] brought a boatload
[1:09:56] but this one thing he he made me realize
[1:09:59] which I wouldn't have brought to you
[1:10:00] that's why I like to go places and hear
[1:10:02] other
[1:10:06] preachers I'm not saying you don't not
[1:10:08] to do that I'm saying you be careful but
[1:10:10] you listen there's some good stuff out
[1:10:12] there we ain't the only boat in so in
[1:10:14] the
[1:10:15] ocean but brother Timothy Dawn he said
[1:10:18] you know brother brandham now remember
[1:10:20] brother random had two Ministries all
[1:10:22] right we're going to cover that is
[1:10:23] everybody with
[1:10:24] me there's two Ministries brother R had
[1:10:26] a Ministry to restore the back to the
[1:10:28] faith of the
[1:10:31] fathers and then bring his message now
[1:10:34] his message was not in the man
[1:10:38] age brother K his message was not in his
[1:10:43] first part of his ministry from 63 back
[1:10:46] was not the eagle age that was just
[1:10:48] restoring what's already been
[1:10:50] known he was just bringing us back he
[1:10:53] was renewing our mind to what had
[1:10:55] already been on the first day of
[1:10:57] Pentecost nothing
[1:11:00] new but when he come to the seals that
[1:11:03] was new that was something man had never
[1:11:06] looked at he said Remember the white
[1:11:08] thing was took off of the pyramid he
[1:11:10] said light shined on things that had
[1:11:12] never been shine on before that's the
[1:11:14] eagle anointing that's the prophetic
[1:11:16] anointing sure he was a prophet when he
[1:11:18] was born sure he was a prophet in
[1:11:20] 1947
[1:11:22] amen he was a prophet to the age we
[1:11:25] don't we don't discount 47 to 63 but
[1:11:28] that was restoration I'll read it to you
[1:11:30] next time I preach brother bam said not
[1:11:32] in the days of
[1:11:34] preparation that's right but when he
[1:11:37] begins to bring his
[1:11:39] message which his message were the seals
[1:11:43] forward don't get quiet on me so the
[1:11:47] first part was a man anointing so
[1:11:49] brother Brandon preached under the man
[1:11:51] anointing you can see it now I can see
[1:11:53] it more clear now than I ever have
[1:11:54] before he's trying to get those
[1:11:56] Pentecostals to come to a place he was
[1:11:58] trying to pull them
[1:11:59] up some did some didn't we were talking
[1:12:03] yesterday brother Jason Watkins said
[1:12:05] that now there's like 13,000 and
[1:12:07] something different
[1:12:09] denominations now brother brandham in
[1:12:11] 1950 something he said there was
[1:12:16] 969 that goes to show you how powerful
[1:12:18] the denomination is brother Ram didn't
[1:12:20] destroy not one denomination when he was
[1:12:22] here he brought people out of them come
[1:12:25] out of her my people and we did too but
[1:12:27] he didn't just lay them denominations
[1:12:29] waste he told them they were the
[1:12:31] Antichrist he told them they were the
[1:12:32] mark of the beast and they went right on
[1:12:34] growing 13,000 different interpretations
[1:12:38] of that Bible right
[1:12:40] there and several thousand in the
[1:12:44] message but he was under the mount
[1:12:46] anointing so let's just keep that in the
[1:12:48] back of your head plant that little seed
[1:12:49] brother random was at the restoration he
[1:12:52] was restoring things back so that could
[1:12:55] bring his message to the people that had
[1:12:57] never been preached before because the
[1:12:59] only person that preached the seals
[1:13:00] prior to brother random in its truth was
[1:13:04] Jesus in Matthew
[1:13:06] 24 hello oh yeah Lin and all them they
[1:13:11] that ly wasn't a prophet he was still a
[1:13:14] trinitarian we see this picture over
[1:13:16] here's got to be all put back together
[1:13:18] like it was over there or it's not an
[1:13:20] alpha bride and Omega bride so let's
[1:13:23] remember that brother randam under the m
[1:13:25] anointing that's what he was doing he
[1:13:27] was trying to get the people but when he
[1:13:29] come to 1963 well prior to 1963 he had
[1:13:33] thousands in his audience hundreds of
[1:13:35] thousands of
[1:13:36] people when no seals broke and then he
[1:13:39] kept going and preaching these different
[1:13:40] things they just kept falling away
[1:13:43] falling away the greatest anointing he
[1:13:45] ever had he said was during the seals he
[1:13:47] said hundreds of my friends will go away
[1:13:49] and he even told them on questions and
[1:13:51] answers on the seals he said you're not
[1:13:53] getting it that's right
[1:13:55] it's not for
[1:13:57] you he's telling that group of people
[1:13:59] they were under the man come on somebody
[1:14:02] they were under the man anointing he
[1:14:03] didn't say they weren't born again he
[1:14:05] just said they're not getting the
[1:14:06] message of the
[1:14:08] hour he said it's gone from you but what
[1:14:10] there's a group of people that's going
[1:14:12] to catch it there's a group of people
[1:14:14] that the crystal is going to be just
[1:14:16] exactly right and whenever they hits
[1:14:18] that Crystal they'll say that ain't
[1:14:19] nothing but the
[1:14:23] truth we can't stand a man ofor we can't
[1:14:26] stay that's my whole point we've got to
[1:14:28] come the transition to Perfection has
[1:14:32] got to be in the
[1:14:35] bride Jesus never ever said I was
[1:14:40] wrong but he was God but that son of man
[1:14:44] Ministry is going to be back in a group
[1:14:45] of
[1:14:46] people I like what brother brother Jason
[1:14:49] said he said now listen we say this she
[1:14:51] is him and we put this thing real close
[1:14:53] he said but now remember you'll never
[1:14:55] never be
[1:14:55] God you'll never be the
[1:14:58] husband we have headship we're going to
[1:15:01] be so
[1:15:03] close amen she is him we have his
[1:15:06] potentials we have his characteristic
[1:15:08] but we ain't Big
[1:15:10] G Big G rules we Little G's but big G
[1:15:15] rules sir all right that's why you have
[1:15:17] to have
[1:15:18] headship we always know he is the head
[1:15:20] he's the head of the what of the body
[1:15:23] the church which is supposed to be like
[1:15:26] him right now look questions and answers
[1:15:29] on the seals this is on the seals you
[1:15:31] see each of these ages only taking a dip
[1:15:35] into the Holy
[1:15:37] Spirit justification is a work of the
[1:15:39] holy spirit all right sanctification is
[1:15:42] a work of the Holy Spirit but the
[1:15:44] baptism is the holy spirit that's the
[1:15:46] reason it took a prophetic Prophet now
[1:15:49] listen let me insert brother R's name
[1:15:51] right there he was a prophetic Prophet
[1:15:54] see Mo was not param was not bartleman
[1:15:58] all them down they were not they were
[1:16:00] the founders and the spokes people just
[1:16:02] like Peter was but we had to have a
[1:16:04] Prophet come on the scene to bring us to
[1:16:07] Perfection God's pattern never changes
[1:16:09] somebody said that this morning God
[1:16:11] don't change I don't know who it
[1:16:16] was he's immutable man he's
[1:16:20] good that's the reason it took a
[1:16:22] prophetic Prophet to come down why no
[1:16:23] Messenger to the age of of
[1:16:25] Pentecost cuz it was the restoration of
[1:16:28] the gifts they were still trinitarians
[1:16:30] they still were baptized in the name of
[1:16:31] Father Son and Holy Ghost they hadn't
[1:16:33] come to the fullness yet some had come
[1:16:35] out some had become then though Jesus
[1:16:37] name Jesus only trinitarians brother R
[1:16:41] said remember he takes the leaf off each
[1:16:42] tree and puts them
[1:16:44] together he stood in that Gap he stood
[1:16:48] in the gap between the Pentecostals and
[1:16:50] this age he stood in the
[1:16:52] Gap no Messenger to the age though cuz
[1:16:55] the Holy Ghost came himself in his
[1:16:57] fullness of the baptism but at the end
[1:17:00] of the age in other words the end of
[1:17:02] Pentecost there had to come a prophet or
[1:17:05] there had to come A A preacher and he
[1:17:07] had to be a prophet I'll read that in
[1:17:09] just a minute as it always ends upon the
[1:17:12] others we find there then the messenger
[1:17:15] sent all these Scruples and things are
[1:17:17] to be placed in their places now that's
[1:17:19] restoring all right like that then the
[1:17:22] Rapture comes for the the
[1:17:25] church now brother Ram was talking about
[1:17:28] the Holy Ghost coming and restoring the
[1:17:31] gifts to the church those gifts were
[1:17:34] always in the
[1:17:36] Bible brother rand's message even the
[1:17:38] seals and even the great messages he
[1:17:41] preached all in the Bible right he
[1:17:44] didn't write a new Bible he didn't have
[1:17:46] a word of the Bible he just give Clarity
[1:17:48] to what was already there he gave
[1:17:50] Clarity where man had clouded it up he
[1:17:53] broke back the the the the curtain of
[1:17:55] time and he said look this is what it
[1:17:58] is it's the love letter cuz if you just
[1:18:02] read the Bible it can condemn you to
[1:18:05] Hell you'll never get anything I'll
[1:18:08] never get perfected I can't do this no
[1:18:10] you can't but if you let the one that
[1:18:12] wrote the book do it cuz when he wrote
[1:18:15] the
[1:18:16] book he had you on his
[1:18:19] mind he had your
[1:18:22] characteristic yours individually had
[1:18:24] your characteristic on his mind when he
[1:18:27] wrote
[1:18:28] that come on he said they're going to
[1:18:30] need this one day in 2024 maybe tomorrow
[1:18:34] maybe the next day there's a situation
[1:18:37] you cannot get a up oh down can't get
[1:18:40] around it you go read a scripture and
[1:18:43] say thank you God there's my Deliverance
[1:18:45] well that was
[1:18:47] eternal the word don't
[1:18:49] change he puts this listen this is a
[1:18:52] very small book yes but it's Eternal and
[1:18:56] it's got everything you need to change
[1:18:59] your body and put you in the future home
[1:19:02] and this is eternal just think about
[1:19:06] that I mean Webster's Dictionary is
[1:19:08] bigger than that it is
[1:19:11] now but this is
[1:19:14] eternal find yourself in this book folks
[1:19:17] if you don't find yourself in this
[1:19:19] book you don't have the new
[1:19:21] birth cuz the one that wrote it
[1:19:25] is the one that's inside of you actually
[1:19:27] looking through your
[1:19:29] eyes if you got the Holy Ghost remember
[1:19:32] amen it's inside you and what you see I
[1:19:36] mean physically see he
[1:19:39] sees
[1:19:42] hello think about that remember what old
[1:19:45] remember brother Sher what he said he
[1:19:47] said now
[1:19:50] devil listen listen so it was funny but
[1:19:54] it's it's true
[1:19:55] old brother shider he's old Gruff big
[1:19:58] individual used to go to church here and
[1:19:59] he passed away but he went to Brother
[1:20:01] Richard Wilson but uh brother Grace he
[1:20:04] said he said devil if you going to play
[1:20:07] in my
[1:20:09] mind he said I'm going open this Bible
[1:20:12] and said me and you going to
[1:20:14] read amen cuz the devil can't stand this
[1:20:18] he said me and you going to look through
[1:20:20] these eyes and we going to read what God
[1:20:21] said about me do that sometime you say
[1:20:24] oh the devil ain't that close you're
[1:20:30] deceived First Corinthians 12:3 devil
[1:20:33] don't bother me oh boy well let me let
[1:20:36] me take a vacation and y'all handle him
[1:20:37] for a little while wherefore I give you
[1:20:40] to understand that no man speaketh by
[1:20:41] the spirit of God calleth Jesus a curse
[1:20:43] and that no man can say that Jesus is
[1:20:45] the Lord but by the Holy Ghost you can
[1:20:47] speak it but there's no meaning behind
[1:20:50] it all right this has got meaning behind
[1:20:53] it when you have the Holy Ghost and you
[1:20:54] say Lord Jesus he
[1:20:58] listens the god that created everything
[1:21:03] listens God don't have no ears yeah well
[1:21:06] God's got ears better than we
[1:21:08] do that no man can call can say that
[1:21:11] Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost
[1:21:13] now there are diversities of gifts by
[1:21:14] The Same Spirit and there are
[1:21:16] differences of administrations by the
[1:21:18] same Lord that's we're putting the
[1:21:20] church together I I like what um we were
[1:21:22] talking about yesterday morning you know
[1:21:24] the Apostle Paul being a prophet when
[1:21:27] you read his writings he set the church
[1:21:31] up told you how to worship told you how
[1:21:34] to study told you how to take communion
[1:21:36] even though he went to the communion
[1:21:37] table told you how to take communion
[1:21:39] told us how to conduct our
[1:21:41] life told us what preachers are supposed
[1:21:44] to do deacons are supposed to do what
[1:21:45] this was supposed to do Paul told us all
[1:21:47] that in just a few writings everything
[1:21:49] we need is right there so we can't
[1:21:52] discount Paul I I wasn't saying Paul
[1:21:54] Paul didn't see the seals but everything
[1:21:56] we got in the seals opens up the Bible
[1:21:59] of what he
[1:22:00] wrote The Love
[1:22:03] Letter CU if you don't get the Love
[1:22:05] Letter like I said before you'll be
[1:22:06] condemned but that in between that love
[1:22:09] letter that God wrote To Us by the Holy
[1:22:12] Ghost you and I are the writers of this
[1:22:19] Bible oh don't get
[1:22:22] quiet who wrote the Bible
[1:22:25] the Holy Ghost AR we talking about you
[1:22:27] getting the Holy Ghost okie dokie
[1:22:29] there's not two of them sir okay listen
[1:22:33] that's why we can understand this
[1:22:35] book the person that wrote it is in
[1:22:38] there telling us what he
[1:22:40] wrote if not you're going to be
[1:22:45] confused but the manifestation of the
[1:22:47] spirit is given to every man to prophit
[1:22:49] with all for to one is given by the
[1:22:52] spirit the word of wisdom now I broke
[1:22:53] these down last
[1:22:54] uh Wednesday but I um we're here today
[1:22:58] so it's the skill in the management of
[1:23:02] Affairs skill and discretion in
[1:23:04] imparting Christian truth that's wisdom
[1:23:09] we have the gift of wisdom in the
[1:23:12] church Supreme intelligence such as
[1:23:16] belongs to
[1:23:18] God that's not man's Wisdom then that's
[1:23:21] the wisdom of
[1:23:22] Almighty to another the word of
[1:23:24] knowledge look he was very specific by
[1:23:28] The Same Spirit all right Paul said by
[1:23:30] The Same Spirit you're going to do these
[1:23:32] things knowledge signifies in general
[1:23:35] intelligence or understanding the
[1:23:37] general knowledge of Christian religion
[1:23:39] the deeper more perfect and enlarged
[1:23:42] knowledge of this
[1:23:45] religion listen there's a lot of people
[1:23:47] know
[1:23:49] God no of him that's right right they
[1:23:53] use his name in vain all the
[1:23:56] time but a deeper more perfect
[1:23:58] understanding if you get that wisdom of
[1:24:01] knowledge wisdom then you get knowledge
[1:24:03] it's a knowledge that this world listen
[1:24:05] don't the world call us
[1:24:08] crazy we're the cult we're a cult we
[1:24:11] follow a man we do this the sisters
[1:24:13] can't do this you can't do that we ain't
[1:24:16] can't there's nobody in this building
[1:24:19] can't you can wear whatever you want to
[1:24:24] right you can smoke whatever you want to
[1:24:28] you can drink whatever you want
[1:24:30] to but I'm telling you the want to ain't
[1:24:33] there no
[1:24:34] more if the want to ain't there no more
[1:24:37] it's not
[1:24:40] you think about that the deeper more
[1:24:43] perfect and enlarged knowledge of this
[1:24:45] religion such as belongs to the more
[1:24:49] advanced especially of things lawful and
[1:24:51] unlawful for Christians moral wisdom
[1:24:54] such as seen in right living you know
[1:24:56] brother Bron we
[1:24:58] were um when Brother Anderson became a
[1:25:01] deacon I was reading through what
[1:25:02] brother R said and you know he comes up
[1:25:04] to a place and and somebody handed him a
[1:25:06] note and uh a couple days before and it
[1:25:10] was a brother's name it was two brothers
[1:25:12] it was brother's name and another
[1:25:13] brother's name and he said now this
[1:25:14] brother's good he said this brother
[1:25:16] there's nothing wrong with him at all
[1:25:19] but he's not
[1:25:20] married a deacon must be married that
[1:25:24] that's the qualifications brother R
[1:25:25] tells you a deacon has more
[1:25:26] qualifications than a pastor does don't
[1:25:29] get quiet it's in the
[1:25:32] Bible all right so a deacon has got to
[1:25:34] be the husband of one wife all right and
[1:25:38] have his
[1:25:40] household right so brother Ram said now
[1:25:43] this brother there's nothing wrong with
[1:25:44] him at all except he's not married so
[1:25:47] he's disqualified they didn't call the
[1:25:48] brother's name he said now this next
[1:25:51] brother y'all brought to me he said he
[1:25:53] said good brother also wonderful brother
[1:25:55] Young Brother married but he hadn't been
[1:25:58] in the faith for about 6
[1:26:01] months he said he don't have enough
[1:26:03] wisdom and knowledge yet he didn't say
[1:26:05] that exactly but that's what he was
[1:26:06] meaning he hadn't been in the faith long
[1:26:08] enough to make decisions or help make
[1:26:10] decisions or help lead a church all
[1:26:12] right is everybody with me so that's
[1:26:13] what the qualifications of this that
[1:26:15] wisdom and knowledge will bring you to a
[1:26:16] place to where you can have an office
[1:26:19] yes all right so to another Faith
[1:26:23] there's some of you in building that has
[1:26:25] wonderful faith and some that don't and
[1:26:26] I'm one that don't I just believe I mean
[1:26:29] I don't have to have anything worked up
[1:26:30] I just believe what God
[1:26:32] Said but we got to have faith yes by The
[1:26:35] Same Spirit that's the conviction of
[1:26:37] truth of anything my faith is in that
[1:26:40] God's
[1:26:41] right my faith is in that that Bible is
[1:26:44] right and he sent us a right Prophet to
[1:26:46] tell us what's going on that's my I put
[1:26:49] my faith in
[1:26:50] that to another the gift of healing by
[1:26:53] The Same Spirit or healing means to make
[1:26:55] whole or to cure or to heal the gift of
[1:26:58] healing is here today if you receive the
[1:26:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost you can be the
[1:27:01] most fit person in the building but
[1:27:04] you're the worst person there ever was
[1:27:06] if you're not born again so there's
[1:27:08] healing in what there's healing in
[1:27:10] receiving the Holy Ghost there's also
[1:27:12] healing and praying for the sick
[1:27:14] right to another the working of Miracles
[1:27:18] Miracles is strength and power and
[1:27:19] ability if you'll um remember what I
[1:27:22] told you that word miracle is a same
[1:27:24] word as dunamus which Jesus said go to
[1:27:27] Jerusalem you'll be endued with power
[1:27:29] from on high dunamus is where they get
[1:27:31] to word Dynamite from so that's the same
[1:27:33] way with the Miracles man it be
[1:27:35] wonderful to have a
[1:27:37] miracle right but sometimes God heals
[1:27:42] Divine Healing is is time listen God
[1:27:45] divinely heals us every
[1:27:49] day that hospital up there's full of
[1:27:51] people that may not be a 100 Christians
[1:27:55] but when but when the doctor does a
[1:27:57] surgery and sews them
[1:27:59] up they can't do no
[1:28:02] more God has to put themselves back
[1:28:05] together God has to do those things and
[1:28:08] he sends a healing Angel y'all may think
[1:28:09] I'm crazy he sends a healing Angel up
[1:28:11] there and heals them because they're
[1:28:13] human
[1:28:14] beings and they have faith in the
[1:28:16] doctors and they have faith that the
[1:28:18] nurse will do the right thing and but
[1:28:20] sometimes it messes up but you know what
[1:28:21] not with God right with God there's
[1:28:24] Miracles and I've seen Miracles I know
[1:28:26] most of you have seen them
[1:28:28] too it was a miracle I'm standing right
[1:28:30] here today I knew somebody said that so
[1:28:34] to another prophecy now this is not
[1:28:37] listen this is not being a
[1:28:39] Prophet this is prophecy all right
[1:28:43] somebody could stand up and prophesy but
[1:28:45] it's got to be judged by two to three
[1:28:47] witnesses to make sure it's right okay
[1:28:50] but listen there's a difference in that
[1:28:52] and a prophet you don't judge Jud a
[1:28:54] prophet nobody judges a prophet but God
[1:28:58] God's the only person that judges a
[1:29:00] prophet you can't judge that's why these
[1:29:01] people that are trying to judge brother
[1:29:04] random they going to have a hard time
[1:29:06] with the day of
[1:29:08] judgment to another prophecy a discourse
[1:29:11] emanating from divine inspiration and
[1:29:14] declaring the purposes of God whether by
[1:29:17] reproving and admonishing the wicked or
[1:29:20] comforting The Afflicted or revealing
[1:29:23] things hidden
[1:29:26] I had a minister that was here long time
[1:29:28] brother Jimmy Harris took me aside told
[1:29:31] me something secret that he was that was
[1:29:33] come from divine inspiration I
[1:29:35] believe he came to
[1:29:39] pass we Marvel sometimes when it comes
[1:29:42] to pass but if God says it somebody said
[1:29:45] today he was perfect and couldn't
[1:29:48] change listen I've heard people say this
[1:29:52] is a God thing this is a God thing this
[1:29:54] is God handling
[1:29:58] everything to another Discerning of
[1:30:00] spirits or judging so somebody's got to
[1:30:02] judge if that spirit's right or wrong
[1:30:04] right to another different kinds of
[1:30:07] tongues the origin of the expression is
[1:30:09] apparently apparent to be found in the
[1:30:12] fact that in Hebrew the tongue is spoken
[1:30:15] of a leading instrument by which the
[1:30:16] Praises of God are proclaimed in other
[1:30:18] words speaking right and that according
[1:30:21] to the more rigorous conception of
[1:30:22] inspiration nothing human in an inspired
[1:30:26] man was thought to be active except the
[1:30:28] tongue put in motion by the Holy Ghost
[1:30:31] all right to another the interpretation
[1:30:33] of Tong now see that's the two lowest
[1:30:34] gifts that's number eight and number
[1:30:37] nine and that's the ones we say well we
[1:30:39] don't have the gifts working in our
[1:30:40] church cuz we hadn't piing that's the
[1:30:43] Lesser
[1:30:44] gift I would that we'd have that but I'd
[1:30:46] rather have somebody with
[1:30:49] wisdom I just read you the scripture all
[1:30:51] that can cease yes remember I just read
[1:30:54] you that all these things will cease but
[1:30:57] not charity or love or agape love agape
[1:31:02] love is not sloppy love I didn't say
[1:31:04] sloppy I said agapy right bio love is
[1:31:10] sloppy love I'm sorry but it ain't of
[1:31:13] God it wasn't supposed to be
[1:31:17] hello filo love was not supposed to be a
[1:31:20] part of this that was brought into being
[1:31:23] when Adam and Eve did what they did and
[1:31:25] God approved of that he had to approved
[1:31:27] of that and said okay you live like that
[1:31:30] you take a husband you get a wife you're
[1:31:31] supposed to be the head of this one
[1:31:33] we've changed the Covenant remember the
[1:31:34] Covenant was like not
[1:31:36] that man and woman was equal before the
[1:31:41] fall try that in the message church
[1:31:43] every once in a while but you are you're
[1:31:47] not going to get over in heaven and just
[1:31:48] and be a lesser vessel right
[1:31:56] sorry to another the interpretation of
[1:31:58] tongues to interpret to translate what
[1:32:01] has been spoken or written in a foreign
[1:32:03] language into the vernacular now the
[1:32:05] vernacular is is what you can understand
[1:32:07] it's in your language all right but all
[1:32:10] these work it one and the selfs Same
[1:32:12] Spirit divided to every man severally as
[1:32:15] he will for as the body is one and have
[1:32:18] many members and all the members of that
[1:32:20] one body being many are one body so is
[1:32:22] Christ for by one Spirit are we all
[1:32:25] baptized into one body whether it be jew
[1:32:28] Gentile Bond or free and who all made to
[1:32:30] drink into one spirit for the body is
[1:32:32] not one member but many amen the Bible
[1:32:37] tells us not to seeds as of many but to
[1:32:40] one seed which is Christ but that one
[1:32:43] seed is in a multiplied form called a
[1:32:46] bride amen all right tell me y all to
[1:32:48] try sleeping at
[1:32:50] night what it takes to overcome unbelief
[1:32:53] I thought we was going to be able to
[1:32:54] have a wonderful
[1:32:59] time then these other nine different
[1:33:02] spiritual gifts oh I'm sorry this is
[1:33:04] 1960 what it takes to
[1:33:07] overcome these different gifts should be
[1:33:09] operating in the church to keep the
[1:33:11] church
[1:33:12] clean like the Anan and safire and so
[1:33:15] forth the spirit of God rise up and call
[1:33:16] somebody out tell them they're living
[1:33:18] wrong and rebuke that sin
[1:33:22] openly it don't sound very good does it
[1:33:25] but that's what we're supposed to do
[1:33:28] rebuke that sin openly and that's what
[1:33:30] the holy spirit is in the church to keep
[1:33:32] the church clean and ready for the
[1:33:33] coming of the
[1:33:34] Lord so it keeps the church clean
[1:33:37] perfected and clean ready for the coming
[1:33:38] of the
[1:33:41] Lord now let's look at just for a moment
[1:33:43] because we're transitioning now
[1:33:45] Pentecost was true and real remember
[1:33:48] listen to me Pentecost was true and real
[1:33:51] because it was in the Bible and the
[1:33:53] Prophet told us that it was the true
[1:33:56] Holy Ghost falling on a group of
[1:33:59] people so Pentecost wasn't false they
[1:34:02] had some
[1:34:04] falsities they have Perfection they had
[1:34:07] a perfect Holy Ghost but remember I read
[1:34:09] you here in just a second where brother
[1:34:10] Brown said the Holy Ghost can only work
[1:34:12] with what you give
[1:34:13] him that's right remember he's
[1:34:16] timid so now look then Along Came the
[1:34:18] Pentecostal age with the baptism of the
[1:34:20] Holy Spirit and they cabbaged down on
[1:34:22] that in other words they sto stop God
[1:34:24] moved on now there cannot be no more
[1:34:26] ages it's the Le Phil he said
[1:34:28] Philadelphia but he meant he said the
[1:34:30] Ley and
[1:34:31] age we find in the study of the
[1:34:34] scripture that the messenger to the age
[1:34:35] come right at the end of the age every
[1:34:37] time so so so what did Paul come at the
[1:34:41] end of he didn't come at the end of
[1:34:43] Ephesus he came at the end of that
[1:34:45] Pentecostal age I was telling you about
[1:34:47] ad30 remember he said I should have been
[1:34:49] there I was one born out of due season
[1:34:51] brother R said the same thing over on
[1:34:52] this side
[1:34:54] Paul come at the End of the Age we find
[1:34:56] out irenius come at the End of the Age
[1:34:58] Martin the End of the Age Luther the end
[1:35:00] of the Catholic age so he's identifying
[1:35:02] exactly what was the Catholic
[1:35:05] age huh it was Columba right that's when
[1:35:10] the Catholic Church Rose there wasn't a
[1:35:11] Catholic age but it was during that age
[1:35:13] the the Catholic Church
[1:35:15] grew and what Wesley at the end of the
[1:35:18] Lutheran age Wesley couldn't come at the
[1:35:21] end of his own age he couldn't bring
[1:35:23] message
[1:35:24] backwards no he had to come at the end
[1:35:26] of the previous age bring his message
[1:35:29] God he went down to the ground into the
[1:35:32] he died his message denominated and what
[1:35:35] to do God brought another one up but he
[1:35:38] came as the Holy Ghost himself to bring
[1:35:39] us to a place to where brother brandham
[1:35:41] could step out on that he brought the
[1:35:44] gifts back in now brother Bram first
[1:35:46] part of his ministry was what gifts
[1:35:48] gifts were operating all the time in his
[1:35:50] ministry even in his church
[1:35:55] so at the end of the Lutheran age and
[1:35:56] Pentecost at the End of the Age of
[1:35:58] sanctification now what was what was the
[1:36:00] age of sanctification
[1:36:02] Wesley all
[1:36:05] right through the B then what at the end
[1:36:08] of the Lutheran age and Pentecost at the
[1:36:09] End of the Age of sanctification through
[1:36:11] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and at the
[1:36:14] end of the Pentecostal age what we've
[1:36:16] been talking about isus street at the
[1:36:18] end of the restoration of the gifts
[1:36:20] coming up to about 1915 to 1920 brother
[1:36:22] R started preaching 30s all right
[1:36:25] everybody with me he got his Commission
[1:36:27] in 47 but folks he was on the river in
[1:36:29] 1933 baptizing those people when the
[1:36:31] angel came and told him his message
[1:36:33] would forerun the coming of the Lord
[1:36:35] right so there was that lap over so now
[1:36:39] watch at the end of the Pentecostal age
[1:36:41] we're supposed to receive according to
[1:36:43] the word as God helped me tonight to
[1:36:45] show you through here that we are to
[1:36:47] receive a messenger that will take all
[1:36:49] these Loose Ends out there and reveal
[1:36:52] the whole secret of of God for the
[1:36:54] rapturing of the church now remember
[1:36:57] that was the man anointing that was
[1:37:00] partial
[1:37:02] remember lion a lion's very very
[1:37:06] powerful
[1:37:07] right powerful man powerful U animal but
[1:37:11] he starts out drinking
[1:37:14] milk the ox is very powerful big animal
[1:37:18] what the start out doing drinking
[1:37:20] milk man
[1:37:24] every one of us sitting in this
[1:37:26] building started out drinking milk amen
[1:37:30] but now the
[1:37:32] eagle there's no milk
[1:37:36] glands Mama eagle has no milk glands
[1:37:39] Mama eagle takes the food kills it chews
[1:37:43] it up and puts it down the throat of
[1:37:46] that baby until that baby can go catch
[1:37:48] his own food that's the eagle anointing
[1:37:51] that's what brother brandham was doing
[1:37:53] he was giving us Eagle food there from
[1:37:56] 1963 on now to me Lord It's Eagle food
[1:37:59] from 47 to to the to the end time right
[1:38:03] amen but there was a people during that
[1:38:05] time listen there was no message church
[1:38:07] when he
[1:38:09] died there was no message said we're
[1:38:11] we're going to be a connected to brother
[1:38:13] brandham no they scattered like the wind
[1:38:15] another group brother Mo different ones
[1:38:17] brother Mike Canada different ones they
[1:38:19] picked that up and started having
[1:38:22] churches this one got started in 71 but
[1:38:25] brother Mo was there with him in the 50s
[1:38:27] and the 60s
[1:38:30] right that transition that lap over
[1:38:33] brought it now to this day and the old
[1:38:36] ones like brother Mo brother Dale
[1:38:38] different ones they're passing on
[1:38:39] because they God keeps
[1:38:41] moving God keeps moving right on through
[1:38:44] God somebody told s me this told me this
[1:38:46] morning God's
[1:38:48] perfect he don't make a mistake all
[1:38:52] right so we got to go from partial to
[1:38:55] perfect so brother brandham started
[1:38:57] listen to me real quick he started in
[1:38:59] the partiality of the Pentecostal
[1:39:04] movement cuz they didn't have they had
[1:39:07] Loose
[1:39:08] Ends they baptized wrong they believed
[1:39:11] in a trinity believed in eternal hell
[1:39:13] they believed that the gifts gave you
[1:39:15] the Holy Ghost now that's wrong right
[1:39:18] God can't now God can write a wrong but
[1:39:21] he can't work with a wrong
[1:39:25] one more time God can write our wrongs
[1:39:27] but he can't work with your
[1:39:29] wrong I'll read you here in a minute
[1:39:31] brother Bri said the Holy Ghost is timid
[1:39:33] it only works with what you give it yes
[1:39:35] and if you give it
[1:39:38] garbage come on if you give it garbage
[1:39:41] it's just going to sit
[1:39:45] there I pray to God that we all give God
[1:39:48] something to work with give that Holy
[1:39:51] Ghost something to work with amen
[1:39:54] read your Bible
[1:39:57] pray pray for
[1:40:00] people because we have come got to come
[1:40:02] to Perfection and we are in that time
[1:40:04] right now yes sir there was no other
[1:40:06] anointing we do not work under the milk
[1:40:09] now Paul said milk's okay like I said
[1:40:12] all of us sitting here I don't care how
[1:40:14] old you were you had some kind of milk
[1:40:16] when you were growing up baby form for
[1:40:18] Mama and all that all the way through
[1:40:21] even if it's that old nasty stuff that
[1:40:22] they give you
[1:40:26] yeah and crushed up English
[1:40:29] peas but we had to start that way yeah
[1:40:33] that was horrible stuff it didn't even
[1:40:35] look good but we ate it why cuz we
[1:40:38] couldn't eat meat at the time but when
[1:40:39] we what when we spake as a child ate as
[1:40:42] a child we were a
[1:40:44] child but now I don't eat my English
[1:40:47] peas mashed up I like English peas but
[1:40:51] don't mash them up it brings back
[1:40:52] memories
[1:40:56] cuz listen folks I'm telling you when I
[1:40:57] was growing up I tell when I was growing
[1:40:59] up you didn't have all this baby food at
[1:41:01] Gerber everywhere now you had a f few
[1:41:04] things here and there but Mom would Mama
[1:41:08] Eagle
[1:41:10] would crush it up and feed it to
[1:41:14] us we didn't even have a food
[1:41:17] processor brother John L John don't roll
[1:41:20] your eyes don't roll your eyes son
[1:41:24] we come through this your daddy just
[1:41:26] ain't told you everything
[1:41:29] yet it's good to see you man you're
[1:41:31] looking good look good looking kid I on
[1:41:33] a kid anymore you're an adult so
[1:41:36] watching the third seal but ain't that
[1:41:37] true I mean that's what we done we came
[1:41:38] through that mashing of the of the food
[1:41:41] and and feeding it to
[1:41:43] us to where
[1:41:45] now I don't like that no
[1:41:48] more I don't need that I want some I
[1:41:51] want some steak and
[1:41:54] yeah tell them brother brother boy and
[1:41:56] bators you know what bat is that's a big
[1:41:59] old baked potato some of y'all shook
[1:42:01] your head other look kind of weird so
[1:42:03] baked
[1:42:04] potato I like that mashed up a little
[1:42:09] bit but we moved through that we had to
[1:42:12] go through that so my point is Pentecost
[1:42:15] had to go through that baby
[1:42:16] stage they had to right cuz they were
[1:42:20] babies brother R said babbling babies so
[1:42:22] because he had to take the children and
[1:42:25] take them and transer them transform
[1:42:27] them to the fathers some did some didn't
[1:42:31] you and I did we weren't back there in
[1:42:34] that age but we come from baby
[1:42:37] form to
[1:42:40] adults third seal
[1:42:42] 1963 now look what we find out as we've
[1:42:44] been studying that down Through the Ages
[1:42:47] we've had reformers now down Through the
[1:42:48] Ages we've had reformers not Prophets
[1:42:53] everybody with me now what does a
[1:42:55] reformer do alcoholics anonymous is a
[1:42:59] reforming okay they say you always are
[1:43:02] drunk if you're drunk you're always
[1:43:03] going to be
[1:43:04] one it's always going to be there so
[1:43:07] don't go to a bar don't don't don't
[1:43:09] don't don't let you know don't start
[1:43:10] drinking again that's
[1:43:13] reforming that's suppressing
[1:43:17] everything the Holy Ghost does not do
[1:43:20] that you become a new creation
[1:43:23] if I was an alcoholic and God saved my
[1:43:26] soul and give me the new birth you could
[1:43:28] put me in a bar with 9 million people
[1:43:30] and 9 million I wouldn't want to be
[1:43:33] there anyway but you could put me there
[1:43:34] and there'd be no temptation
[1:43:37] that's because the person that made me
[1:43:39] do it is
[1:43:47] gone they're
[1:43:50] dead so they were reformers not profets
[1:43:54] reformers and each look now each office
[1:43:56] carries its own work now watch he's
[1:43:59] going to explain this just like a man
[1:44:00] that's a telephone operator he isn't
[1:44:02] exactly an electrician he might do a
[1:44:05] little job at it y'all don't know what
[1:44:07] telephone operators were they used to
[1:44:08] have
[1:44:09] to okay watch an old
[1:44:11] movie just like a man that's a telephone
[1:44:14] operator he isn't exactly an electrician
[1:44:16] he might do a little job at it and like
[1:44:18] if a man is a lineman well a man that's
[1:44:21] a post hoold digger and never did any
[1:44:23] Line work he better keep off the line
[1:44:25] remember brother Brandon was a lineman
[1:44:27] but he might do a little patch-up work
[1:44:29] we don't want patch
[1:44:31] up we're going we're transitioning now
[1:44:33] from partial to perfect we're
[1:44:35] transitioning to Perfection but you got
[1:44:38] to start
[1:44:40] somewhere but when the real thing is to
[1:44:43] be revealed at the last day of the last
[1:44:46] part of the church you and I are the
[1:44:49] last part of the church
[1:44:54] is when God has said that he would send
[1:44:56] to us according to the scripture and
[1:44:59] we've searched it through and through
[1:45:00] that he predicted that the spirit of
[1:45:02] Elijah would return in some person yes
[1:45:06] now he was specific do you know they
[1:45:07] believe the spirit of Elijah is here
[1:45:10] I've heard him preaching he preached on
[1:45:12] internet but not message
[1:45:14] believer they just throwing it out and
[1:45:16] said it's just the spirit of Elijah on a
[1:45:19] group of people no Spirit of Elijah was
[1:45:21] on brother Ram
[1:45:23] amen and then we're little eaglets
[1:45:25] underneath that but he's the prophet
[1:45:27] messenger we're not right but when the
[1:45:30] real thing is to be revealed at the last
[1:45:32] day of the last part of the church is
[1:45:33] when God has said he would send to us
[1:45:35] according to the scripture remember
[1:45:38] behold I
[1:45:39] send you Elijah the
[1:45:43] prophet and we've searched it through
[1:45:45] and through that he predicted that the
[1:45:47] spirit of Elijah would return in some
[1:45:50] person now I think that's been made just
[1:45:52] as clear and we're looking for that to
[1:45:54] happen somewhere in anointed person in
[1:45:56] the last day to rise up you'll hear a
[1:45:58] lot of Fanatics and everything
[1:46:00] else it's the devil trying to take away
[1:46:03] from the real one when it gets here but
[1:46:05] it will be properly identified and we
[1:46:08] believe that okay I know we do but the
[1:46:10] world
[1:46:12] don't and watch that and you'll know and
[1:46:15] then when now the elect will know the
[1:46:18] Lord not the others hallu they sure
[1:46:22] won't do it it they'll miss it a million
[1:46:27] miles for seal 1963 will be done here
[1:46:30] just about 30 45 more
[1:46:37] minutes I ought to woke you up just a
[1:46:42] second now watch this is this is this is
[1:46:45] this is the part I wanted to get to now
[1:46:47] brother Bown 1963 is on the fourth seal
[1:46:49] he's recapping the first three seals all
[1:46:52] right if you you're watching brother ra
[1:46:53] he'll spend 20 minutes recapping the
[1:46:55] seal before and then bring his message
[1:46:58] all right not under the revelation of
[1:47:00] the lion age now see so so there's a
[1:47:03] revelation they didn't
[1:47:06] get hello pay attention not under the
[1:47:10] revelation of the lon age or the first
[1:47:12] age the early age this wasn't revealed
[1:47:16] now what is this he's preaching the
[1:47:18] seals come
[1:47:20] on Paul died before the seals even come
[1:47:23] to to John the
[1:47:26] Revelator so now look the next age was
[1:47:29] the age of the ox which is the Dark Age
[1:47:31] the middle age it wasn't
[1:47:34] revealed as what it was we were talking
[1:47:37] yesterday there is no church AE
[1:47:39] messenger ever knew he was a church AE
[1:47:41] messenger except maybe Paul and brother
[1:47:45] brandham I don't think Luther ever knew
[1:47:49] well I'm just a messenger I'm the church
[1:47:50] age messenger number five and Wesley
[1:47:53] didn't either they just what they got
[1:47:55] the spirit of God they preached the word
[1:47:56] of God and they let the chips fall where
[1:47:59] they may but we know and we can
[1:48:03] understand by their characteristics that
[1:48:04] it had to be those
[1:48:07] people all right it wasn't revealed as
[1:48:09] what it was nor the manlike Beast of
[1:48:12] wisdom representing the reformers Luther
[1:48:15] and Wesley now watch you said and so
[1:48:19] forth Luther Wesley and so forth
[1:48:23] Pentecost and so it wasn't revealed but
[1:48:26] in the eagle age the last age the
[1:48:29] prophetic age where there is to rise a
[1:48:32] prophetic utterance to whom the secrets
[1:48:36] always comes amamos 2 and9 what I'll do
[1:48:40] nothing till I reveal those secrets to
[1:48:42] my servant the
[1:48:46] prophet so Malachi 4 it says turn the
[1:48:50] heart of the children to the fathers
[1:48:51] lest I come andile the Earth with a
[1:48:53] curse and we know brother random he C he
[1:48:56] tried to take the Pentecostal babies to
[1:48:58] maturity that's the children to the
[1:49:00] fathers what faith of the fathers back
[1:49:02] to Paul back to Peter and back to the
[1:49:04] original
[1:49:06] Church Hebrews 6:1 Paul's telling us
[1:49:09] said therefore leaving the principles of
[1:49:12] the doctrine of Christ don't leave them
[1:49:14] like do away with them had a brother not
[1:49:16] too long ago he said oh we don't have to
[1:49:17] take communion and we don't have to do
[1:49:18] this he said Paul says just leave those
[1:49:21] principles I I said
[1:49:24] brother that's not the way I read
[1:49:28] it communion is important to
[1:49:31] me all the water baptism that's all
[1:49:33] important to me that never went away I
[1:49:35] don't have to get baptized every Sunday
[1:49:38] though but I know where I came from and
[1:49:41] I know it's important so it's laying
[1:49:43] there as my foundation so we don't leave
[1:49:46] the principles listen Paul would be he
[1:49:50] he'd be a false prophet if he meant what
[1:49:52] you're reading right there to just leave
[1:49:54] them and don't ever do them no more
[1:49:57] Jesus said do this till I
[1:49:59] come therefore leaving the principles of
[1:50:02] the doctrine of Christ let us go on let
[1:50:05] us transition from partial to perfect
[1:50:08] let us transition from from I once a
[1:50:11] child I spake as a child I ate as a
[1:50:13] child I did childish things but when I
[1:50:15] become a
[1:50:16] man I put away childish
[1:50:20] things L look not laying again the
[1:50:23] foundation of repentance from dead works
[1:50:24] and Faith toward god of the doctrine of
[1:50:26] baptism laying on of hands resurrection
[1:50:28] of the dead and eternal judgment and
[1:50:30] this we will do if God permit in other
[1:50:32] words we're going to go on to
[1:50:34] Perfection but we're not going to ever
[1:50:36] forget the doctrine of baptism how in
[1:50:38] the world can you forget your baptism if
[1:50:41] you've never been baptized then God
[1:50:42] bless you you
[1:50:44] better it's important it ain't
[1:50:47] mandatory but it's
[1:50:51] important I mean come on
[1:50:53] these people been saved and have been
[1:50:54] baptized all right but it is important
[1:50:57] if you're sitting here sucking air today
[1:50:59] and you haven't been baptized you need
[1:51:00] to be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:51:01] Christ all right but we're not getting
[1:51:04] away from that but I got it right here
[1:51:05] in my
[1:51:07] head I was baptized down in Gillsville
[1:51:10] can the creek name of the Lord Jesus
[1:51:13] Christ
[1:51:15] January
[1:51:17] 1989 I remember that you don't remember
[1:51:20] the day you got baptized you better
[1:51:22] remember the day you got
[1:51:23] baptized some of you ought to know it
[1:51:26] cuz we just recently did it right but
[1:51:29] we're not leaving those and not ever
[1:51:31] preaching them ever again that's what
[1:51:33] that brother no we don't we need to go
[1:51:34] on and do these brother you got to have
[1:51:37] this right here this is your foundation
[1:51:41] listen this is your promise to get to
[1:51:43] the remember the baby food if you didn't
[1:51:46] eat that baby
[1:51:48] food you didn't you're not going to be
[1:51:50] sitting here today you're going to be
[1:51:51] gone passed away so we ate baby food
[1:51:54] when we needed baby food and like I just
[1:51:57] said I can't forget it I can't forget
[1:51:59] them mashed up peie but I ain't going to
[1:52:02] eat them again I'm going
[1:52:04] on and this will we do if God permit
[1:52:07] listen brother R said look he said you
[1:52:10] using wrong end of the string now this
[1:52:12] is this is an angel talking to brother
[1:52:15] brandham all right he said you're using
[1:52:18] the wrong end of the string he's got
[1:52:19] he's in a vision he's fishing he's
[1:52:21] trying to catch trout right and I looked
[1:52:23] down on the floor and there laid truly
[1:52:25] there laid the string all went out a
[1:52:27] nice ate them an inch and taped down
[1:52:29] real nice he said you can't teach
[1:52:32] Pentecostal babies Supernatural
[1:52:35] things you'll cause carnal
[1:52:38] impersonations remember after brother
[1:52:39] Ram came on the scene they had people
[1:52:41] that had oil coming out of their hands
[1:52:43] and and blood coming off their forehead
[1:52:45] well they were doing it all
[1:52:47] theirself that wasn't the truth and you
[1:52:50] know what happened their life proved it
[1:52:53] right he said no that's
[1:52:55] true I perceive your Prophet 1953
[1:52:58] there's quite a difference between a
[1:52:59] gift of Prophecy and a prophet what I
[1:53:01] was talking about a minute ago a gift of
[1:53:03] Prophecy is in the church but a prophet
[1:53:05] is born a prophet all right that's the
[1:53:08] difference so this man might prophesy
[1:53:11] tonight and never prophesy
[1:53:13] again all right it might be on that
[1:53:16] woman over there the next night this man
[1:53:18] back here the next night and that one
[1:53:20] over there but when the gift of Prophecy
[1:53:23] is operating it cannot be received
[1:53:26] unless two or three judge it and see
[1:53:28] whether it's right or not but a prophet
[1:53:31] singular Prophet p r o p h e t is born a
[1:53:35] prophet comes up a prophet everything he
[1:53:38] says is in the name of the
[1:53:41] Lord and it does not have to be
[1:53:46] judged only by
[1:53:49] God is absolutely truth if he's
[1:53:52] prophesying now a gift has to First be
[1:53:55] recognized to be in the Bible and then
[1:53:57] if it's in the Bible the man claims it
[1:53:58] then if God confirms that gift we know
[1:54:01] brother right God confirmed his gift
[1:54:03] over and over thousands and hundreds of
[1:54:07] thousands of
[1:54:08] time then he ought to believe but now
[1:54:10] remember that was under the man
[1:54:12] anointing that was the worm on the
[1:54:16] hook the hook was full Perfection the
[1:54:20] worm was to get them to come to get them
[1:54:22] to come to that but what did they do
[1:54:25] they eat the worm spit the hook out
[1:54:27] we've had that had we brother Danny
[1:54:29] several
[1:54:30] times but that's what they did they
[1:54:32] didn't get the
[1:54:34] hook they got the
[1:54:36] bait and they continued just give me the
[1:54:38] worm I don't just give me the worm don't
[1:54:40] give me that hook just give me the
[1:54:42] worm then if that gift is testified by
[1:54:45] God then God's giving the man the gift
[1:54:47] if God says so you have no right watch
[1:54:50] this you have no right to doubt it
[1:54:52] you we have no right to doubt that
[1:54:56] brother brandham was a
[1:54:57] prophet if he's
[1:55:00] Vindicated which we know he is well now
[1:55:03] a gift of Prophecy gift of discernment
[1:55:05] gift of wisdom gift of knowledge all
[1:55:07] these things are Divine gifts that sets
[1:55:09] in the church and oh God grant today
[1:55:11] that we'll all come together and see
[1:55:13] that those nine spiritual gifts move in
[1:55:15] the church operating the whole church
[1:55:16] body then we'll have a Rapture look
[1:55:19] watch this then it will be called out
[1:55:27] then we'll have a
[1:55:29] Rapture so there's a cing out
[1:55:34] coming if we can't have faith for Divine
[1:55:36] Healing how are we going to have faith
[1:55:38] for Rapture in faith the church has got
[1:55:40] a ways to go yet but I believe God will
[1:55:44] do it I believe God will do it we ain't
[1:55:48] going to we ain't going to be able to do
[1:55:49] it God will do it just a few more quotes
[1:55:52] we'll be done we read these Wednesday
[1:55:54] night I'm going to read them again the
[1:55:56] holy spirit's very timid just a little
[1:55:59] just a little least little thing Grieves
[1:56:02] it away that's why we have to have order
[1:56:04] in church that's why we have to have you
[1:56:06] know kids not running around and playing
[1:56:07] and eating and drinking and all that
[1:56:09] stuff little kids we know we they do
[1:56:11] that that's fine but now if you're 8
[1:56:13] nine 10 years old sing back there eating
[1:56:15] a sandwich you're in trouble if you was
[1:56:17] mine you'd be in real
[1:56:19] trouble well don't get quiet
[1:56:22] we've had these things set in the church
[1:56:24] for us this is not
[1:56:27] new this is something brother randam
[1:56:29] read Church order rech order and
[1:56:31] Doctrine very plain that's why we don't
[1:56:34] run he said he said you a kid running a
[1:56:38] church he said would affect the next
[1:56:41] meeting it would grieve the Holy Spirit
[1:56:43] from this building so much the next
[1:56:45] meeting would be
[1:56:46] hindered wow so let's do the best we can
[1:56:50] we do a good job in church order
[1:56:53] you get to Rushing look now watch you
[1:56:55] get to rushing the holy spirit's very
[1:56:57] timid and I don't want you to rush I
[1:57:00] want you to be reverent like you have
[1:57:02] plenty of
[1:57:03] time that's right be alert the holy
[1:57:08] spirit this is all in the prayer line
[1:57:09] brother R was telling teaching the
[1:57:10] people don't get up and walk
[1:57:12] around don't move he even he said don't
[1:57:15] move he said because you're a spirit and
[1:57:18] when I'm catching that Spirit In other
[1:57:20] words he didn't say this but it is what
[1:57:21] it is he watching every spirit and when
[1:57:23] the spirit's moving and the Holy Ghost
[1:57:25] is moving there could be
[1:57:28] confusion or I'm going to try to find
[1:57:31] that quote I found it one time and I
[1:57:32] can't find it again I'll try to find it
[1:57:34] where brother R said he said something
[1:57:36] happened on the platform he said the
[1:57:37] Holy Ghost left the platform and left me
[1:57:40] standing
[1:57:42] there it wasn't something he did it was
[1:57:44] something somebody else did and left me
[1:57:46] standing there and he said I'm no
[1:57:49] good listen to have the Holy Ghost
[1:57:52] that was a special gift he had to one
[1:57:56] generation we can have it to a degree
[1:57:58] but not in the scale he had it that was
[1:58:01] one gift for one generation that gift
[1:58:04] that he had a Divine Healing you and I
[1:58:06] have Divine Healing sure but not where
[1:58:07] we can run a prayer line and and and
[1:58:10] call every person in the prayer line and
[1:58:11] tell them where they was at yesterday
[1:58:13] and what color the doctor's glasses were
[1:58:15] and we that's
[1:58:17] not let's work on the nine spiritual
[1:58:20] gifts first all right that that was what
[1:58:22] was given in the church to keep them
[1:58:24] clean very timid it just won't tolerate
[1:58:28] nothing
[1:58:29] wrong identify Christ of all ages the
[1:58:32] holy spirit is timid very timid and
[1:58:34] where you have just one unbeliever or a
[1:58:37] skeptic sitting around the Holy Spirit
[1:58:39] cannot work hardly remember Jesus do you
[1:58:42] remember in the scripture where Jesus
[1:58:44] they laughed at him they disbelieved him
[1:58:46] and even him being God Almighty and
[1:58:48] human flesh he had to take that person
[1:58:50] out of the city that's right get him
[1:58:53] away from everybody so that he could
[1:58:55] heal him think about me and you remember
[1:58:59] Jesus had to had a man let a man Plum
[1:59:02] out of the city to heal him one time
[1:59:04] just to get him away from
[1:59:07] unbelief Queen of Sheba there's too much
[1:59:11] confusion the holy spirit is timid
[1:59:13] everything must be decently and in order
[1:59:15] for the Holy Spirit now this is one that
[1:59:17] we'll stop right here we need something
[1:59:19] to work on before the the Holy Ghost can
[1:59:23] ever go to work all right is everybody
[1:59:25] with
[1:59:26] me he's got to have something to work
[1:59:34] with pray
[1:59:37] up read
[1:59:39] up don't bring them demons in we got
[1:59:42] enough here
[1:59:44] already leave them at the
[1:59:47] door prayer folks prayer
[1:59:50] repentance I do that every time I walk
[1:59:52] through that door now not when I'm up
[1:59:54] here working or doing something but in
[1:59:55] the mornings come to church or in the
[1:59:57] evening I said God forgive me of my sins
[2:00:00] I said I am so sorry anything I don't
[2:00:02] want to hinder and you you've heard of
[2:00:03] me before some of you young ones don't
[2:00:05] young people that that are coming now
[2:00:08] when you when Dad was preaching and and
[2:00:10] when he prayed for somebody I didn't
[2:00:12] pray for that
[2:00:17] person don't look over at your
[2:00:20] neighbor tell you
[2:00:23] why cuz that's between the preacher that
[2:00:25] was anointed and that person right that
[2:00:30] person works the gift everybody with me
[2:00:33] but if you're sitting over there with
[2:00:34] unconfessed
[2:00:36] sin come on somebody you sit over there
[2:00:39] with unconfessed sin you can hinder that
[2:00:42] person from getting
[2:00:44] healed so I rais my hands and even in
[2:00:46] the back there when they're praying for
[2:00:47] him if I in the back I lay I say God
[2:00:51] don't let me do anything let no spirit
[2:00:54] inside of me hinder that person getting
[2:00:56] their healing now see to me that gives
[2:00:59] that channel time to work between these
[2:01:02] two
[2:01:03] people cuz that's where it's got to come
[2:01:05] from it's not a group thing when you
[2:01:08] come up here as an individual it's an
[2:01:09] individual you're you're looking for
[2:01:10] something and you got to work the gift
[2:01:13] you're working it
[2:01:14] now or hindering it one of the
[2:01:18] two so he's got to have something to
[2:01:20] work with so try try that sometime just
[2:01:23] pray for the person that's okay I'm not
[2:01:24] saying I don't but I'm just saying God
[2:01:27] don't let me be the one that hinders
[2:01:29] them getting
[2:01:30] healed don't let anything I've done said
[2:01:33] Spirit what just Lord just clear my mind
[2:01:36] and let them get their healing
[2:01:40] right that way it ain't somebody stand
[2:01:42] up here say I laid hands on them and
[2:01:44] prayed for them and they got healed
[2:01:46] that's
[2:01:48] garbage ain't no stinking individual
[2:01:50] ever healed nobody that's right Jesus
[2:01:53] Christ is the Healer he's the perfect
[2:01:56] one we just operate the gift we can't
[2:01:59] heal
[2:02:01] nobody you know that oh this Pharisee
[2:02:04] age that we're living in that was in
[2:02:09] 1957 wow I'll tell you I never let a
[2:02:13] seventh grade dummy tell me I come from
[2:02:15] so so and I got a college education but
[2:02:18] you haven't got gumption enough to know
[2:02:20] how to control it maybe
[2:02:23] he was telling those Pentecostals you
[2:02:26] got the
[2:02:27] gifts but you're doing them wrong you're
[2:02:30] hindering the work remember brother R
[2:02:32] said one time he said that sister
[2:02:33] hindered the prayer line cuz she stood
[2:02:35] up just stood up and started prophesying
[2:02:37] every service said she'd get ready and
[2:02:39] get her hair all fixed up and you know
[2:02:41] pull her hose up and all that stuff cuz
[2:02:43] she was getting ready to stand up and
[2:02:45] make a
[2:02:46] spectacle brother Brown told her to sit
[2:02:48] down and shut up remember that
[2:02:55] hm you know how to control it that might
[2:02:57] mean a lot whole lot different brother I
[2:03:00] tell you Paul had one too but he said he
[2:03:02] forgot everything he's talking about a
[2:03:04] degree but he got forgot everything he
[2:03:06] ever knew in order to find Christ the
[2:03:09] trouble of it the church needs today we
[2:03:11] need to dump out a whole lot of stuff so
[2:03:14] we can be filled up again dght Moody
[2:03:16] said God will only fill those who are
[2:03:18] not full of their
[2:03:19] self and what a profound St
[2:03:25] statement he said how can I teach them
[2:03:27] algebra when they don't even know their
[2:03:29] ABCs and other words under the man
[2:03:30] anointing he's trying to he's trying to
[2:03:32] pull them he's pulling them trying to
[2:03:33] get them out of that age some of them
[2:03:35] come some of them don't how can I tell
[2:03:38] you spiritual things about heaven tell
[2:03:40] you them spiritual things about Heavenly
[2:03:42] things let the Pentecostal
[2:03:44] Church let Lula
[2:03:47] Church straighten itself up get right
[2:03:50] with God and I'll prove to you that the
[2:03:52] Holy Ghost will come right
[2:03:54] in while this the church will be so full
[2:03:57] of the power of the Holy Ghost that
[2:03:59] can't be one member do one
[2:04:02] sin do you believe
[2:04:05] that the Holy Ghost will call it right
[2:04:08] out like Anan in safire but you can't do
[2:04:10] it when you won't even take your
[2:04:12] kindergarten training certainly not
[2:04:15] magicians come
[2:04:17] on 1 Corinthians 13 we go back to that
[2:04:20] again we'll cover this next time we'll
[2:04:23] start with the transition to Perfection
[2:04:25] we we really got you a background now
[2:04:27] but we'll get to it charity never
[2:04:28] faileth but whether that be prophecies
[2:04:31] they'll fail tongues they'll cease
[2:04:34] knowledge it'll vanish for we know in
[2:04:37] part we prophesy in part let's stand our
[2:04:40] feet but when that which is perfect is
[2:04:43] come now look
[2:04:45] Paul is
[2:04:47] prophesying when
[2:04:49] that he didn't know what to call it
[2:04:54] okay he didn't know what to call it he
[2:04:56] said it's a that but when that which is
[2:04:59] perfect which was the eagle anointing
[2:05:03] the message of the hour under brother
[2:05:05] brandom the eagle anointing that's the
[2:05:08] that he's talking
[2:05:10] about boy I mean and we're in that that
[2:05:13] we're in that but when that which is
[2:05:16] perfect has come then that which is in
[2:05:18] part shall be done away when I was a
[2:05:21] child I spake as a child I understood as
[2:05:23] a child I thought as a child but when I
[2:05:26] became a man I put away childish things
[2:05:29] for now we see through a glass Darkly
[2:05:31] but then face to face now I know in part
[2:05:35] now look that won't do us any good today
[2:05:38] you got to start knowing part but we're
[2:05:40] going from partial to perfect you said I
[2:05:42] can't do it you just stopped yourself
[2:05:44] right there you just confess with your
[2:05:47] mouth that you can't do it so God only
[2:05:51] what he goes by your confession he's the
[2:05:54] high priest of your confession well I've
[2:05:57] got all this and that and the other well
[2:05:58] so do everybody else this person set
[2:05:59] beside of you got as many problems as
[2:06:01] you
[2:06:02] do work on your own don't try to work on
[2:06:06] theirs now I know in part but then shall
[2:06:09] I know even as also I am known and now
[2:06:11] abideth faith hope and charity these
[2:06:13] three but the greatest of these is
[2:06:17] Charity we'll start right there with
[2:06:18] Revelations 3:14 folks we are in the
[2:06:22] beginning of the creation of God this is
[2:06:25] the way God want it to wanted it to be
[2:06:28] in the first
[2:06:31] church but they weren't required a
[2:06:33] Rapture you and I are required a
[2:06:36] Rapture what was the beginning of the
[2:06:39] creation of
[2:06:41] God it
[2:06:43] wasn't when he said let there be
[2:06:46] light that's a finished physical
[2:06:49] creation the beginning of the creation
[2:06:51] of God is when God made him a
[2:06:55] body and stepped into it made him a baby
[2:07:00] I made him a germ and an
[2:07:03] egg and the spirit of God came in he was
[2:07:07] a beginning of the creation of God now
[2:07:09] what is what was his name Lord Jesus
[2:07:11] Christ but what was his title son of
[2:07:14] man that identifies right there that
[2:07:17] we're in the son of man that last age is
[2:07:20] in the son of man age cuz we are back to
[2:07:22] the creation the true beginning of the
[2:07:25] creation of God you are standing today
[2:07:27] outside of your Humanity the way God
[2:07:29] wanted you I said outside of your faults
[2:07:31] and your Humanity he wanted to have
[2:07:33] somebody walking in human flesh that had
[2:07:35] his spirit inside of them in its
[2:07:38] fullness not in training got to take

[2:15:50] you'd like to help um serving there
[2:15:52] after the uh youth service and some of
[2:15:55] your youth call some of your friends or
[2:15:56] call somebody that's got kids and tell
[2:15:58] them invite them to come and it' be the
[2:16:00] last one we have for the for the year
[2:16:02] we'll start him back up in January
[2:16:04] brother Daryl Ward's going to be here
[2:16:05] for that one we already got him schedule
[2:16:07] so we appreciate all of you love you
[2:16:09] with the love of the Lord just see
[2:16:10] sister June and uh and just think pray
[2:16:14] about that Vision books um I really lay
[2:16:17] it on my heart to do that and just just
[2:16:20] simple
[2:16:22] $20 bold it up put it away once a month
[2:16:26] don't go to Starbucks shouldn't anyway
[2:16:29] go go to Starbucks and buy $20 coffee go
[2:16:32] to McDonald's they got a $1 menu get you
[2:16:34] a cup of coffee then take that $19 and
[2:16:37] put in your pocket and give it to the
[2:16:40] Lord listen the only reason I'm saying
[2:16:42] this is that was just so I figured maybe
[2:16:44] it was $2 a book $5 for the big book you
[2:16:48] know that that for to produce them he
[2:16:50] said no he said we can make millions of
[2:16:52] them for8 cents a piece and I'm talking
[2:16:54] about your regular message books and and
[2:16:56] 86 cents for for the seal book The
[2:16:59] Church age book less than a dollar and
[2:17:01] it's just a miracle and then they
[2:17:03] distribute them no
[2:17:06] charge for that so I I think we need to
[2:17:10] get on board with that one and and help
[2:17:12] the bride that we'll never see but I'm
[2:17:14] going to tell you something somebody
