brother mark lord because he's having a lot of trouble with his kidneys and do you just pray to bless guide us and all forgive our sins lead us in jesus name amen all right now i want to read this whole or not to hold but i want to read over to the about the 16th 17th verse because i want you to get a point i told you back under that we would uh when we finished the series and we got on over to the uh covering predestination the brothers took over and they've covered a lot of of things about predestination and so we're we're laying it out in order i told you we would just get some little points maybe as a service or two and just take that point you know to uh uh instead of having a series thing uh we'll try to just do it in a message or two to get the thoughts and ideas of of what we need okay so let's just read from john 15. he said i am the true vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me now remember who bears does the vine or do the brain our the branch is what bears the vines only supports the nutrients and things out to the you know bringing it to the branch and doing those things but remember that now all right every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every brains that bear fruit he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit now you know purging is cutting off a lot of things that we don't need so that's what we've been dealing with is kind of in the day and talking last night in the the bible study had a marvelous time talking about you know the age and the time we're at the adoption the points of where that this age is the one age that's no other age has been responsible or anything for what we are because we're the winding up of all things okay now and you're clean through the word which i have spoken unto you abide in me and i knew as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no man no more can ye accept you abide in me i am the vine you are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing all right now remember you say well wait a minute you've emphasized the point john in your writing that the branch because they mentioned it about four or five times in these first four five verses talking about the brains to get you the idea the thought to point to who you are we are the branches he's the vine we're just the branches all right the branches is what brings forth the fruit though amen all right so then look at the importance of what he's talking about and he says i am the vine you are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing now he's making his point right if a man abide not in me he is cast out a catch forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they're burned if you abide in me in my words abiding you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you herein is my father glorified what that you buy much fruit all right so it takes some sometimes from chastening some whipping some uh cutting away the uh excess things off of the vines and the branches and things like that getting it lined up right as the father had loved me so have i loved you continue ye in my love if you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love even as i have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love these things have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full this is my commandment that if you love one another as i have loved you you know that you love one another greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends now watch he's changing his point okay watch watch the reading now because look at the word friends you're my friends no over here he calls you a branch now he calls you a friend listen to him but i have called you friends for all things that i have heard of my father have made known unto you you have not chosen me but i've chosen you and ordained you that you should go forth and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should be should remain that whatsoever you asked of the father in my name he may give it unto you this these things i command you that you love one another you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word that's uh i was asked kind of last night you know how did i study how did i do sometimes see that's the way i like to do i like to read the bible and just follow through because here over in the beginning he's calling you a branch now he's calling your friend the greater things there because he's calling you a friend but remember now he said to judah's friend because judas was chosen he was in that job in that position place there that we were talking about last night of the gifts and the things and judas was called he called him friend the bible talks about abraham being what a friend of god see a friend is greater than than the branch you sometimes the branches what's doing but remember the branch without the vine there's no fruit all right so then you got to upgrade from your branch to you know a branch part to think about he's now calling you like he did abraham a friend great position for someone to say a friend you know i mean you you know you think about somebody in your life that has been your close friend you know somebody that's been close to you and been a friend to you see a friend would lay down his life for his brother you know because that's a friend all right see we need to keep that in mind now is what i'm trying to get to into the point but i want to not back up so far into what we've been talking about predestination as much as to taking the thought because it's been bearing on me to just uh maybe speak a little bit of where that jesus said there i've chosen you so you didn't choose me i chose you all right the bible covers through many things i chose you ordained you all right so we're going upward to from if you're understanding my point we're going from a branch because the branch is no good without the vine but the vine is not will not produce correctly or never will in the basis because it's the branch it produces so the vine must be there too and then now he's summing that up to come up to friendship that is uh a greater point of loving one another and being friends one to another that would give our life for each other as a friend amen all right now so what we want to talk about for a little bit now is one of the thoughts that we were covering in the series back before to sum up what jesus is saying coming from a branch to the vine and without means no good me without you and then coming to calling his friend all right so we can see that he would more easily choose a friend than to choose a branch or a vine or a thought like that because it's coming into the human race to talk about it but to sum up this point or thought how does god choose all right now how does he choose he's all he just picks in no no the prophet says he doesn't pick his desire is that everybody be saved all right he wished everybody would come to that place but he knows they won't so he's covered it here in a reading of this if the branch don't bear for fruit cut it off do it purge it okay it comes to the very age that we're living because adoption is cutting away the things that we do not need and bringing us to a place to where that we are the children of god amen being his offspring all right now and thinking about it how does god choose without being a respecter or a person without you thinking how could god do it without you know the human being say uh you know trying to figure that out and go the wrong way so how does god [Music] choose he choose like we do see we choose one thing today and tomorrow we'd you know we drive a uh uh a buick one day and then the next day we may be driving a cadillac the next day you know might be back down to a volkswagen because we're just making our choices over the natural thing all right we choose churches we go here we do that we go up and down we we do in choosing those churches we choose that by what we think is what would be the best part for our lives or thoughts all right but how does god choose without making him a respecter of person do you understand that yeah i just picked that thought up to they're doing it and and laid it aside during that series and just then well we'll come back to that all right but in summing up all that jesus said then he climaxes it by saying you didn't choose me i chose you all right now you said well but brother dale i've done this i've done that we can go through the lengthy series or whatever and thoughts when we did in that series of services and things we covered a lot about that god predestinates and how does he predestinate amen not by his desires not by what he he would want to be but what he predestinates by for knowledge all right now listen to what i'm talking about see if you approach for knowledge predestination choosing etc if you approach it in one direction you'll wind up being like a lot of the people of the message are you know i've got this born with this seed in me and and i always was eternal i don't need nothing else you know i'm i'm ready to go and they go most of the time they go after other doctrines or ideas and leave the message you know so they do some going with it but thing of it is see if you approach it on the wrong direction you'll come out wrong amen true that's right you'll come out with your own concept or thought or idea about it but if you preach approach it according to the word of god see keeping your scriptures close together and reading them and following it and like i said they're a while ago see see you say well how do you study so well i see long years ago i was preaching from romans 8 and and different ones in ephesians and preaching about predestination and in preaching those things you know i tried to emphasize so much to us that we would follow it that god predestinates by foreknowledge not by choice see then that way it's not you choosing him that's right right it's him choosing you now but we've got to keep when we've come to that side of the story we start another emphasis on the point right all right another thought you say then brother dale i chose god are you accepted right that's right choosing is a hard word because it covers a lot of things but you accepted what he done for you and you must do that but remember that he looked down through time and saw you would accept it if he offered it to you amen right right but he also saw judas's carrot which was chosen for the job and put into the position and and had the gifts and all of the things everything working in his life in a great thing right yet he turned down god make your calling an election the scripture says sure yeah in other words make sure you know what you're talking about you say yeah but brother dale them brothers can quote so much of this that will praise god but can you come back to one simple thing now this is the way i've been all my life for for 50 years ministering to you and i'm sorry not for ministering to you but for 50 years trying to get you to see something the more simple you make anything the better off it is right the more simple or simplified form aversion well see then we must approach then the fact of how does god choose by approaching it from a simple point that even a child can understand and see then uh your children you think well i chose to be who i am no you didn't now we have adoptions in the in the bases and all so you understand that part but that still you didn't have any choice you know remember kids you didn't have any choice he was born to dale he was born to fly bush he was born of robbers did you have any choice about your family that you were allowed to come into no right now other than the fact of adoption or bringing into that way you know okay we can pick up that part but still remember that it's the parents that are doing the choosing even if it's in adoption it's not you going into the adoption agency and applying for parents right it's the parents going in and applying for you so now we got it simple leave it up to the parents and now then kids you can blame your mom and daddy for everything in the world every time anything goes wrong you say well you made me you chose me like this you say no i didn't choose you like that and i tried to correct you through the time to get you to not come out to be right but evidently i didn't apply the right rule you know or ruler you know in doing that much and because today they you know they say you can whip your child with a belt or a fat and like that but you can't do it with a stick i i never did understand it it's just getting the attention of the child anyway but listen now but how does god choose without it being a respecter of persons and the thing formed me paul says can't say why did you form me this way because god never formed us wrong he formed us correctly we chose the wrong thing amen well i can't help to be what i am i'm just born this way no no you wasn't born that way you become that away all right by your own choosing so then is it that god chooses us without us choosing no when he chooses us we must accept the fact of him choosing us and agree to the stipulations or the points or parts of that choice or the the thing of coming into the family so then see he can he can choose by his foreknowledge he knows exactly what you and i will do that's right well why didn't he stop me from doing it that would be the opposite side of the story now you're gonna start trying to blame him for those things because there is something about this situation see by you accepting jesus christ as your savior you made a choice okay you made a choice you chose for him to be your savior amen well no he made it for me because that's what you're saying no no because remember when he was talking to the disciples in this illustration here in john he was also speaking to judas's character amen he chose judas iscariot amen he justified him to him believing on him he sanctified him in saint john 17. that's who he's talking to here judas was right in this group and he sanctified him he set him aside cleansed him all right see it's not a poor old judas attitude you know well he didn't know no he had the same position that the disciples had all of them had the same situation so judas was chosen of god but what happened what happened to the story when some of the others went through more horrible ways or doings and things than maybe judas ever had to go through see then you can't make his choosing be hand picking you can't have that he said okay i'm going to put judas in here but then i'm going to throw him out no judas chose god now we're getting a little bit different on choosing than our thoughts maybe sometimes is letting us run judas chose god chose him he chose god he chose him through justification to follow him and to believe him he had gifts he had the signs and wonders of the apostles and all of those things but yet what happened in the end of all things at the state of sanctification then you have to put everybody at the same all of the disciples see we won't deal with every person but the 12. all 12 of them stood in the same place picture of god for a job ordained for that anointed for that amen and judas just as present it's the rest of them god never goofed up in choosing but there's a simple little way of keeping predestination straight and fornotted just remember foreknowledge is knowledge before is that simple enough knowledge before anything takes place is for knowledge and remember it was for knowledge that put it to the basis that even before the foundation of the world the bible tells you that jesus christ stood as a lamb slain and when he was chosen for that position you know what you were chosen right there in him because that's what it says chosen in him we'll get to that in a minute in ephesians chosen in him we were chosen of him but remember judas could be into that position of being chosen of him but when it become to the analyses or what you'd call it the finality of it all whose problem was it did god turn down judas did he give him something that was beyond the point that he could abide by it and but yet he didn't do with the other disciples you know did he do something like that no that would be something according to his desires and he desires that all man be saved he desired that judas is carrot be saved he called him friend friend why have you come to betray me see we don't look at it in the right order we look at cain and abel you know a situation or something like that but just remember cain was offered the same thing that abel was offered cain then was chosen of god as much as abel was in the basis of election and what was to take place see the people this message you heard a lot of people oh but cain he didn't know cain had a choice that the bible said if you would have been chosen if you'd have done like your brother in other words he just said go and do it now understand if he was telling him how the brother got to that position he was telling him you're going to do right now he wasn't saying you have done and you're doomed because you didn't do right no he's telling him go right now go right now and do what your brother done and you'll be accepted right because that way is god putting forth the choice but knowing the choice that's right for knowledge that before the world ever begun god knew every person that would ever come into this world and what our choices would be right everybody but he has to put it before everybody the same yes what's the difference between the foolish virgins and the virgins that's right at one stage of the journey until the day of pentecost you didn't have 12 uh 10 virgins right now i hope you follow this point and you didn't have five wives and five foolish until you come into the new testament because see that's where we miss it if we get the point that the salvation was not in the old testament in the form to were that it could bring you forth and and bring you into the right position salvation came through jesus christ upon calvary see then develop the idea or form to where that you could have five wise and five foolish because what's the five wives those that have the baptism of the holy ghost they couldn't have had the baptism in the holy ghost if jesus christ hadn't died so it's all based upon that amen right so it's a time of calvary until they made their choice god's choice was the same for the foolish and the wives he desired that they both be saved i'm just picking up scriptures to make you think in the simplified form of thinking about you know what has happened did god look down through and see you as a goody-goody and say well i like that you know i'll choose that one but i'll reject this one over here you're going to wind up in trouble because you're going to get into east on jacob and you're going to find out in in jacob that he's a shyster and you're going to find out that a lot of esau is doing was better than what jacob done right now you've got to get that involved but it's all involved in one thing god foreknew all things amen he could say to the prophets back there even in jeremiah and him and say i knew you ordained you before the world ever begun amen when was the choosing and the rejecting see that's why jesus christ why did jesus christ have to die before the foundation in the world why wouldn't it have been in time that he would come to we know he did physically in time oh we know that but what would be the emphasis of the bible talking about it the bible speaks of it like the more emphasis is placed upon that before the foundation of the world god would know all things and then he wouldn't have to write down a book he just let you live it there ain't going to be a whole bunch of books when we get there and those things where it says books you know in revelation we talked about the other day uh you know no no it's all become we're going to be computerized right you know it's going to be set up on that basis that the whole thing will go and he can see everything about us and know everything but i've tried to get you to understand one thing i know i'm crazy in the way i think but you realize you go back as far as you can go and that's for knowledge for knowledge is as far as you can go all right that's why the prophet emphasized that we were not back there as beings people etcetera we was in his mind not as identities of people or thoughts we we were not in that we were in his mind all right so then the mind goes back so far until we won't have no court of appeal when we get there because it won't be that he said well i you know i i know i realized i've done you wrong jacob i i mean he saw i've done you a little wrong order or done this out of the other when you know i can preach your sermon on jacob and esau and show you that it looked like god did have favoritism and in jacob you know it kind of looked like he favored him just a little you know what he did now then you have to stop and think right how could he have a favoritism to jacob and it not be something of his desire could it be that he was looking at what each one of us would do could it be there's the foreknowledge could it be that he could see right what it would be and then all he's got to do is just lay it out and let it transpire and he just comes by and drops a little meal is that uh uh ruth and boaz come by and just drop a little extra meal and you just reach down and pick that up and you oh you have a good time and he says what there's more than just keep following the ones that's dropping it he goes to them and says drop a little x tree for them is that now what you're thinking about the choosing of a of uh jacob over esau what if it is folks that jacob loved god i proved it to you back there in the series time we were talking about abraham abraham was called a friend of god abraham loved god david loved god that no matter what took place or what happened to the life of david you know he would come right back and fall on his knees and cry out to a living god and god would just drop down and say that's a man after my own heart that's hard to explain because you say one can jump up and say well what about david's adulterer and murder this out of the other is that after god's own heart no no what's the love see we had a choice in who we was to marry in things or something like that or a job as we worked at we know those things have been a choice but see when i when i asked peggy to accept me as and i would never nobody in that room i tell you do not play with your little jitty jaddy kids words don't don't talk to somebody on the serious matter of marriages and things until you get a lot of emphasis or a lot of help by somebody else kids don't just go out and say oh yeah i'll marry you oh yeah i love you talks cheap right right but it can get you in trouble you don't realize it gets you in trouble because by your words to be justified by your words will be condemned so be careful how you use your words don't be cheap about it david wasn't on my point david wasn't being cheap about his love for god david loved god amen no matter what god would turn and do to david david just the lord i love you abraham a friend of god moses lipped to ear as never to any man that was ever made talked like that lift the ear that moses talked to god god loved him that's what i said about the fruit sometimes you have to cut the limb off sometimes you have to prune this and do that and that's what he had to do to mankind he had to do those things to keep us from being he had to whip david and sometimes you remember that one time somebody was preaching about this recently here uh you know one time david he god had just laid it out in front of him now do you want to do this do you want to be in the presence of your enemies for so many days you want to lose this you want the plagues to come you want what to do and david looked at him and says i want to be left in the hands of my god that's paraphrasing it was close enough he said i want to be in the hands of my god you know what it cost him thousands of lives but he'd rather do that and lose half of his army than to go with some idea or some point of his own of his own desires and wind up and not lose nobody you understand what i'm getting at how does god choose without being a respecter of persons how is it that he can choose without being a respecter it's simple if you look at it correctly he looked all the way down through and see exactly everything we do he knows what you're going to do he knows the choice you're going to make well you know what he just has it ready for you amen but he knows what everybody will choose then the fact of us choosing him the prophet was not and the bible is not saying it when it says you didn't choose me i cho you didn't dream i chose you and then come over to brother branham and brother brown and give you emphasis over and over and over about the the doings of of choosing and all like that and you didn't choose him he chose you you it looks like if you could preach that you could actually wind up with a good uh mixed-up denomination but a situation would exist that you'd blame god for everything because remember if you can blame him for everything you're in trouble who'd want a god that you could blame him for everything and get by with it oh that'd be nice no it wouldn't i don't want to blame god for my doings i don't even blame the devil for my actions you don't hear me saying the devil made me do it i'm the devil itself if you want to take it that way because it's not going to be on the basis that you can blame the the devil even for your doing sure we know what it is we know what the devil does and how he comes through and how he lives through life and what he does with our lives and how he perverts us and and things because even in the garden see satan it's hard for to understand what the prophet is talking about but he says that satan was the the designer of eve in the garden huh anybody want to take that one satan's a designer you mean he made her like that no he didn't make her like that god made her like that now then you're on to me about it right god didn't make eve do the wrong he knew what she would do he didn't make us go wrong in sin but he knew his immediate lift turning us loose that it would go to that basis all right see you can't pull anything over on god so quit trying to quit trying to blame somebody else or what you're doing and just blame yourself cry out for deliverance and say lord help me see we've come in this stage until we're through the and we're talking about life not about it we're at the age of adoption that no age faced this age in what it's doing while they down through their brother delay was killed by the millions they was given a whole lot easier than trying to live now and do right what well are you listening what about all of these these heartaches and troubles that are coming upon us and what about when you finalize it the bible says i sent these things among you to try you i sent them he said amen amen i allowed these things to happen all of these things i've got the book sister lonely of of people with those viruses and and over the past uh hundred years there's been um something in the neighborhood of 500 million or billion people there's some big outstanding number that have died in all of these viruses and things some of them had two and three hundred thousand people we're not in nothing today compared to what some of those viruses took and are still taking all right but listen to what i'm talking about god doesn't pick and choose the way we do get it all out of our mind of understanding of how god does things and think about how simple it is i had nothing to do with the way it turned out to be left-handed piggy had nothing to do with that oh you can call it a genetic what genetic felt it and what terence didn't turn out left-handed i mean you know you say well i'll blame it on this lane no no no just get it to the bases but remember we're serving the god that knows everything amen he knew before the world ever begun ever nap that would ever be in the world and how many times it would bat its eye now that's infinite amen but he knew that amen so then it would be very easy to just watch it take place create mankind make him not wrong make him perfect not eternal come on there's a difference in the word make him perfect adam and eve were made perfect right they were given the the eternal life in their soul that's how close to perfection it would come out to be well yet they would still do wrong that's why you don't hear that among the preachers of the message because they can't handle that what do you mean well adam and eve according to brother random one blasphemy's name adam and eve had eternal life in the garden in their soul not in their body not in their spirit that's right go read the book and come back and tell me well i don't believe it that's what i mean you ain't going to do it you're going to prove what you are by doing that well don't you think god knew what she was going to do amen you know in school they told us to read certain books i enjoyed reading but i didn't enjoy making bookmarks my book works there what you call it you know i didn't enjoy having to write those stories you know they'd assign you a book and tell you want to write a story about it well first off i just wind up and give my dog my sister my uh book and tell her to make me a book report that done pretty good on that until one day i forgot and you know how you had to turn the notes in and i forgot and turned in my sister's notes on the book the teacher found out what i was doing you know all right but i'm like this too i really i've always been the one that i enjoy reading i enjoy getting into something and reading this a lot of people are not made that away this is for some reason but some people just made to the basis oh uh zane gray or what his name was the one that wrote all of the western movies back you know and all the things that wrote all the books about him and everything i enjoyed that i could get right in there and just be right in there with him pulling guns and just shooting because i could read it and become a part of it you know what that's what i do about the bible i love to read it and read me living there that's why i emphasize so much to you lately what last year or so church it's this is a personal thing something personal between you and god amen he wants you to see who you are what you're doing here but he saw you before the world get away from the peeking and choosing of how good it is but get down to the bases that what if you could just look over the building today and just see everybody's thoughts and ideas you know that's why i don't want to be a prophet that wouldn't work with me i'd go crazy to the bad it's bad enough as it did but to just look out across the congregation being able to tell you all your thoughts you say oh i'd love to do it no no no brother branham said you don't feel a knife sticking in his back that was his friend i wouldn't want to do that but you know what to be able to live our lives together that's been a wonderful thing to me my wife and i have been together 50 what one two years or when are we going 62. well how many we i don't even know we're getting all this mess it up but 62 years her daddy told me something i told the kids about it or told richard them about it the other day that i've never told anybody of what her daddy said daddy said to me one day he said sam he said peggy is a good little girl i'd ask him to marry her you know and everything because that's always that way i think your boys ought to go to the parents and ask the parents can you marry their children i i believe in that and i went to talk to him and said well you know ask his permission he said she's a good girl said she'll blow her stack said she'll become you know a little irritated with you but he said in about 30 minutes she'll be over it well you know what i know that so she blows her stack sometimes a house i said okay 30 minutes i got to find something to do but the problem is see i blow my stack and ain't no 30 minutes to get over it you understand it takes me a week or two or all right to get over my parts you know to get it settled out but if you'll pay attention to kids especially to mom you'll find that trait is there that she'll be upset with you but about five minutes all you gotta do is say mom you're gonna have some biscuits ready for supper okay she'll be up cooking biscuits even though she don't feel like it but see that's a trait that's a thought or an idea the reason to that point is to think about god what about a god that could look all the way down through time what about a guard that could do that don't you think he gets upset with us a lot he said god getting upset don't you think he gets upset of us a lot of things in our lives every day maybe i think he does but there's always been one thing that my wife knows i've told her i said no matter what i do or say or think don't take that as the final point wait a day or two and look at the situation my point was i wouldn't mind her having total uh ability to know all of my thoughts now this is going to be contrary to a lot of people because a lot of people don't want you to know their thoughts because they keep secret themselves by not letting out their thoughts well see i'm not that way to you i'm that away as long as you get my life's thought because my life's thought's going to be the good one i'm going to have bad thoughts but i'm going to get over it right and i'm going to be anchored into that and there's no problem what are you talking about god for knew ever move everything we do and you know what he looked out of us living it all the way down through and didn't get mad and throw us away right we're down here at the end of all things and i'm glad of it at the end of all things you're going to know all things and you're going to see then and all of it is right right all things that are wrong will be made right that's why there is a judgment seat of christ not a white throne judgment for you to have to go to the bride does not go to that but she has to have the judgment seat of christ to give an account of the deeds done in the body whether good or bad it is not a decision of eternal life to decide whether or not you're going to heaven but it is the fact that we went through life and done those things and those things have got to be cleared out that's what i'm talking about and why i believe it's so here because right here's a way to do and get rid of all of our our little troubles and heartaches and problems and things and come out of it where the bible says the judgments it begins at the house of the lord we're on a day that it can be made possible to get rid of all of our wrongs will you ever come to a place that you won't have a wrong thought i didn't say that i said get rid of my wrongs i'll always have my problems but i won't be blaming everybody else i'll accept it on the basis and keep it to work that i can say this is me why because that's the way god chooses he had a world full of people for some reason he chose twelve he had a world full of people one one time he chose a little virgin to have a child could it be that he could sit down and look and see things that we are going through life and to see it that we could go different and him still know what we're doing you don't believe god that way i know you don't because i've tried to explain it i've tried to explain to one thing of god that he could know anything even though it would go the opposite direction he would still know where the right or wrong of it is that's right well because he's god don't never do away with an infinite god that could know everything because that's what he's doing what is it how does god predestinate brother branham buy for knowledge because he could look all the way back before the eternities ever started and see everything that would go all the way through and wind up with all being made eternal in the future home and all of the things he's god he can do all of those things nothing is hidden from him but like i said down through that time he would see us mess up and do but he'd see us go and cry that's what i say about david that's why he was a man there for me he'd go out and do wrong but yet you'd see him repent he'd go cry out to god god said okay david i'm gonna have to whip you you ever done this with your kids you ever told your kids that it's going to hurt you more than it does then for you to whip them you ever done that i mean really told god you know or told you your parents told your your children let me write it this is going to hurt me more than it does you well see that the kids i know they didn't understand it so one day they was at the house and the kids got to acting up you know the grandkids to us and they got they're doing wrong and doing that in the other and they was trying to get them straight down about time they'd get this straight and i need to be over here in this crowd not tell them get that straight and be back over here they was having problems there's kids you know i looked over at them started laughing i said now y'all know what i'm talking about then when i used to try to tell you that it hurt me more to whoop you than it did for you to get whipped let's take care of them you know make a mind don't you think god sometimes looks down and kind of laughs and he said you know what old brother john duret he's let me pick on him a little let me give him back trouble you mean god gave it to him well where to get it come on that's a perfect man are we in the message god puts those things on there to try to bring us to a position he lets things come among us look at all these viruses and the different things but you know what i'm going to say this one time i mentioned it but i'm going to say it this way the virus didn't change a lot of people you just think about it a lot of the people that were not steady and coming to church they didn't come regular they do it's the same people when the virus comes they didn't come regular but they're already doing that right they're already laying out and coming when they wanted to and doing what they wanted to do the virus didn't change the thing it gave you a reason gave you something to lie about because you got problems right that's right he didn't pull down over on god what if this is the point that what he brought to straighten us out amen amen well how did we work how did we do i failed i don't know about you i figure i failed totally right because of me but listen god knows every move everything you'll ever do so don't worry about it worry about the end point of what i'm talking about right i was expressing that a minute at the end of all things think about it that god has allowed us to live and to bring us the of the truth of god that sometimes he'd have to whip us to get us to line up well that's not a loving god if he loved me that's what's wrong with me and you a dodie granddaddy grandma they pet them kids you know and huh we love them we want to do it right but sometimes god has to put things on us to get us to line up that's right but do we think of it that way now i'm just getting it god's foreknowledge the prophet said he knew that by making mankind mankind would fall now how did he know that how did he know mankind would fall because he'd already seen it he seen all he had to do is create man give man a choice and we'd automatically fall that's right amen that makes god the author of sin no it doesn't make him authorism makes him the god of eternal life because he knew what choice was mine but see he also knows the choice what we do he knows exactly how far he can push you he knows exactly how much punishment he can place upon each one of us you see mean god punishing us well let's use another word just to get you off the hook let's use the word try yeah god knows how much he can put on and try us because he knows where we're going to blow the stack but do you know the point yourself how far you can go have we fallen in love with god enough to realize that no matter what he does he's my daddy he's my father i talked to him like that now tell him i said father sometimes you know that i didn't know my daddy because he died when i was four years old i never got to know him very much but to think that you would give me an opportunity to be able to just if nothing else if i die and go to hell give me an opportunity to study thy word and study it from a prophet's view of the word how would you say it or or god's view of it instead of our own views we had our own views we sat down in the baptist we talked about things in the baptist i've heard adoption preached in the baptist see a lot of you you can't say the things that i can't i've seen a lot of things that was preached there i heard of of the old doctrine that man didn't even have a soul until the giving of the law i heard those things in the baptist church you never heard doctrines like they were we were we studied things you know what i'm talking about we had we had things back there we talked about things i thoroughly enjoyed the old man that was preaching when we left the baptist church he was a good old baptist 80 something years old talking about things that you heard brother branham talk about and i don't believe that he heard brother branham maybe he did because he never would the only thing he'd said was he says i'm not saying nothing i said have you ever heard of william branham he said i'm not saying nothing about the man he said there are some other people i'd like for you to talk to that would be able to discuss things but said i will not say nothing about the man it's because i'm sure he had to respect i've heard him tell about how he'd get up be preaching away and this man get up and start coming to the altar and a woman jump up and run over in front of him shouting speaking in tongues and things in the baptist church you say you weren't back there and all you were in the baptist church we used to sing and worship god so one day he said i'm going to end this thing next time she jumped up and started crosstalk in front of that man coming to the altar he went over to her and told her you sat down and shut up i'm sure he wasn't a popular fella right because everybody thought she was in the spirit yeah but he said the man comes out and got saved that night you see i've heard things in the baptist church we studied things we talk about things and brother around him come along telling us about these things some of the things i had you've never heard of what i've said there's a doctrine that man never had a soul until the law came into existence because the law was a knowledge of sin and a soul was human knowledge they never come into existence until the writing of the ten commandments i said well according to the bible it says in genesis adam was his living soul and i ran into that at work down there one day and the man told me that and he said well i've never seen it like that but you see church i've tried my best to study the word to try to get you to see things try to get you to understand what it is that's bothering us and doing our wrongs and doing in our lives and and hindering us the most because it's not the big things that's doing it it's the little things that we allow to happen to lead us astray but we should always have one thing in mind god knows every move will ever make right he knows everything we'll ever do every way but you know what he still loves us does god love sin no no no no does god love for us to be sinners no no no no no he just knows we will he knows what we're going to do before the world ever begun amen so you're not pulling anything over on him he knows exactly what we think what kind of life we were talking about the other day what kind of a doing or maybe it was last night or something what what would it be if you was like brother branham that node ever thought or everything that you could walk up to him and he'd you know tell your thoughts and all like that i don't want it i don't want it what little bit i've got i don't want i've got just enough to realize that you and i need to get very simple in our understanding so all right very simple language god created the world knowing that mankind would fall he could not make it fall so he went ahead and even wrote the lounge book of life amen but see he not only knows the people of the wise virgins as i was bringing a while ago the true born again he knows the foolish virgins he knows what all of us will think and what we'll do amen but yet he don't throw us away he said cain you would have been accepted if you do what your brother done he knew what judas was going to do he finally told him says go do what you've got to do right nobody else in the crowd knew what he's doing they thought he'd send him to buy food or do this out or the other but he sent him out to two deny him and set up the crucifixion but yet he didn't right and scream and holler at him when he come back he said friend what about it church come on musician what about it god by foreknowledge knowledge before anything takes place knew what you and i would be doing today knew exactly where we'd be sitting what would be doing what we'd be thinking let's see what i love about him is that he corrects us he chastens us he does all things but he don't throw us away he don't throw us away because he didn't choose us to throw us away he never throwed judas away judas went out on his own he didn't run him off and just simply told him said go do what you got to do because he knew then it was already finished what about you and now let's stand again what we got brother sing though of course created me a clean heart [Music] created [Music] he said god knew abraham would teach his children he knew we would be people that would try our best [Music] for the joy [Music] one more time [Music] remember next week [Music] me within me [Music] oh [Music] spirit [Music] you know this is the very day every day is a day of salvation with god and this is the very day [Music] that we should catch on to the basis of what's going on in the land and around the world and start getting ready to get out of here this is what we're here for [Music] he's already looked down to see who it is so he just already goes down there and he just sets our way have you ever felt his presence to where did this be so sweet so much until you just realize that the creator of all things is right there with you [Music] me salvation
