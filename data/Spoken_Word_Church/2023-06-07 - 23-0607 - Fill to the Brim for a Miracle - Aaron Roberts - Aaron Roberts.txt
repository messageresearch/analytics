you let's stand this evening and uh look into the scripture John chapter 2 and the beginning of verse 1. and uh I was trying to think of a song that uh actually went along with what I was what I want to speak about tonight and uh that's the only song that the first song actually really come to my mind and had that in it but John Chapter 2 beginning at verse one and uh it's about uh turning the water into wine and I I titled this failed to filled to the brim for a miracle and uh I I heard something the other day just caught my attention and what struck me I was listening to somebody do you know that the water to wine is probably one of the most common Miracles that's talked about that Jesus performed people that are not Christians people that are or don't know read the Bible they don't go to church but people will tell you that Jesus turned water to wine they know about water to wine but what was interesting was when you look at that everybody's like well Jesus turned the water to wine well you know what something had to take place something had to take place so that's what I want to look at tonight was that's what's what caught my attention when I was hearing that you know because everybody thinks well you know just Jesus done this and Jesus done that but you know what it took somebody had to do something there had to be an Act of Faith for God to perform and if we if we see that you know it says well God just does yeah but lots of times what holds God from doing things is we don't do it what we're supposed to do amen amen so let's just all bow our heads this evening and remember all the ones that are sick and Afflicted on all the needs but I thank the Lord he's always a miracle work in God he's always the great physician and all we got to do is just trust him amen let's just all pray Heavenly Father we thank you this time Lord to be in your house this evening Lord Jesus for Lord together with those of like Precious Faith Lord Jesus father we just pray that you just come amongst us this evening Lord just help us Lord just get ourselves out of the way Lord that you can have the preeminence father you just come and be the speaker and the hearer Lord Lord we have natural hearing Lord but it takes Supernatural hearing it takes the Holy Spirit Lord for us to hear father there's many times we've heard we've heard the prophets say so many things we just be listening to read read a book and we and we've passed over it hundreds of times and all of a sudden you come in Quicken that and it's just like it becomes brand new we don't see it the same way anymore and father that's what we're Desiring Lord that you come and just anoint us Lord you get the glory out of this or do you just help each one that's that's not here Lord the ones that are in this building that have needs Lord you know what's on every heart every desire and Lord we just commit it to you and the ones that are watching in Lord we just pray that you be with them and touch them whatever their needs may be Lord you've heard all the requests that has been mentioned and Lord we just commit them to you Lord because we know that you're whatever the question is whatever the problem is whatever the situation is you are the answer to it and Lord we just commit it to you Lord we just thank you for all your blessings on us and we just want to say that we love you because you first loved us and where would we be without you so Lord we just Commit This to you Lord just bless the reading of your word bless your people in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen John chapter 2 beginning at verse 1. and it says and the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee and the mother of Jesus was there and both Jesus was called and it is disciples to the marriage and when they wanted wine the mother of Jesus saith unto him they have no wine Jesus saith unto her woman what have I to do with thee my an hour is not yet come his mother saith unto the servants whatsoever he saith do unto you do it and there were set there six water pots of stone after the manner of the purification purifying of the Jews containing two or three Firkins a piece Jesus saith unto them fill the water pots with water and they were filled filled them up to the brim and he saith unto them draw out now and bear unto the governor of the feast and they bear it and when when the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine and knew not once it was but the servants which drew the water knew the governor of the feast called the bridegroom and saith unto him every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine and when men have well drunk then that which is worse but thou has kept the good wine until now this beginning of miracles did Jesus and Cana of Galilee and manifested forth his glory and his disciples believed on him amen God bless you you may have your seats this evening God bless the reading of the word and so that was as I was saying I was I I was listening to a man and he was talking about you know this being the one of the most commonly known Miracles even people that aren't Christians they know about this uh this miracle that took place but you know lots of times we don't under you know we don't understand we don't look at the scope a lot of people don't look at the scope of what it takes for for a miracle and you know um brother Branham was speaking in a message and uh at a at kadish Barney and brother random is talking about miracles and you know he was talking about you know not for us to ask for miracles he said but you know we look to God we put our faith in God because God he said signs follow the Believers he said if we if we have our trust in God in his word then the Miracles will take place he said God performs miracles but the thing is is he said he said brother I said the Bible says a week a week a week an adulterous generation seeks after miracles he said we don't seek after Miracles but he said but God performs miracles he said right at the same time he said that he was performing miracles he said I don't he said I don't believe in evidences he said I believe in the evidence that we're saved we took God at his word so that's the main thing he's taken God at his word but you know God does Miracles he's a miracle-working God but the main thing is is not seeking after a sign and not seeking after a miracle but putting our trust in God because whatever God wants to do God is Sovereign in what he does and you know but the thing is is God wants us to have TR our trust in him to have confidence in him and you know whatever he wants to do then praise God I know one thing whatever God does he don't make a mistake he's never he's never wrong you know because I I love what you know when when they were speaking to Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War and you know they were asking him said you know who's right the the union or the or the Confederates and you know you know is the Lord on our side and he's like he said it's not he said it's not whether God is on their side or God is on our side he said my question is and my goal is to make sure I'm on the Lord's Side he said because the Lord's always right and many times we try to get it where we try to get God on our side and the Really the main focus is we need to be on God's side we need to have Lord the Lord's plan and his will that's what we need to look for not trying to mold everything to us but we need to be molded unto his plan whatever he want his will his way that's what we want and so when we we seek for these things see we are seeking not Miracles but we are seeking the word we are seeking God's word and you know one of the things that brother I was talking about was when you when you see you know the greatest Miracle that's taking place you know we we don't realize sometimes when we look for a miracle to take place but really the greatest Miracle that's ever taken place is when you come from a sinner that is cut off alienated from the life of God when you're when you're hopeless and helpless and when the creator of all Heaven and Earth comes down when he comes the sins to you and makes himself known to you and he takes up residence in you that's the greatest miracle and anytime we say well we're looking for a miracle we're looking for you don't realize but you are a walking Miracle the miracle has already taken place he's standing in your midst as the miracle the problem you are a miracle and you're and he is what he has done is this is a masterpiece and many times we don't we don't see that we don't consider that but we are a miracle and we are a masterpiece of God's grace of his of his power and in the world today you know people look at and they they look at the world and they see all these great Majestic things and you know they they try to split atoms and you know they're trying to figure out all these great things and understand the mysteries of all these great things that God has created and not realizing the greatest one is when God said let us make man in our own image and our after our likeness and for him to have dominion over the Earth and that's what he still wants to have today because through the fall that was what was separated from man he lost that ability he lost that relationship he lost that all of that that God had designed for him that he had designed man to do was to have dominion to be an amateur God to fulfill the plan of God and when when that failed and guess what God made a way because he knew it was one to take place he created a way for God to bring man back into that place back into the same fellowship and so that's what God has for us today and so the thing is is but there's a but there is a way that we must come to come into that and so that's what God has for us if we can just follow what God has for us the plan of God what God has done for us and realizing it's greater and there's more of it and so brother Brandon was speaking he was speaking to the to his disciples and you know he was telling them about what they needed to do because when we see when when man was separated from God you know that he got away from the word of God you know Eve separated herself because she didn't follow the word she got out from behind the fortification that the word presented to her it protected her and even Adam knowing that that he was in the wrong and yet he went out with her why because his love for her and he knew what was what he'd done but you know what he had love for her and so he went out with her knowing what he was giving up and he went out but you know what that was showing a type of of Christ because you know what he descended from the highest uh the highest of Glory from Heaven to come and Condes sin to be the same as you are to be to go through the same things that you and I have went through to feel the pain and the and the loneliness and every other thing that we can face that as a human to face these things but to bring us back to bring us back into Fellowship and when he began to speak to the disciples and he began to tell them he you know he tells them he said now listen he said you go out into the world go you into all the world and preach the gospel he said they signed shall follow them that believe he said that was it he said get back to the same word it'll produce the same blank he said they followed that word and it zeroed in and drove attack every attack every promise that God made was made manifest he said he said if we'll get back to that same word it'll drive the same tax do the same Miracles perform the same things make the same light make the same creature raise the dead heal the sick cast out Devils see Visions prophecies it's the same gospel that drove the text then if if it will get back to that to the same thing and if somebody just like a gun having the having the same conditions and it when a gun is set right when the when the barrel is correct when the scope is set when the sites are correct every single time when you're holding that rifle the same every single time if you can hit the bullseye the first time you should hit the bullet uh every single time it shouldn't there should be combined because he was saying so if you if we get the he said if we can get all the vibrations of unbelief out of us God's work will still be like it was at the first beginning that's exactly right it'll zero every time it did once it'll do it again don't be be satisfied with a Creed or something stay right there until the word zeros so we have to follow the same word but if if we've done it one time and he laid out the plan for us to come back that all we've got to do is get in that same plan follow that same thing and it'll zero every time but you know that's what Satan's see that's not what Satan's playing is that's what is Satan's desire is is to hinder you to block you to stop you from what God has for you but you know the God is God is there and he's trying to reach out to you and bring you to the place that he wants you to come to but the problem is is you know we we have the pro we have the power it's ours we give we give Satan the right to say well yeah you know what you can just come and get in my way and stop me because you know what I'm not going to go any further because you know if we listen to him and you know it's just like you know brother boy you brought this up so but you know you I'm not I'm not going I'm not gonna mention any names the names of the guilty are omitted to protect them I guess but you know but you know you you see people that you know when they when just like you know he talks about you you get into a certain situation and you see these people and you know they you try to and yeah y'all y'all worked y'all understand but I mean it's so amazing how you know you try to work with people you try to have a good relationship with them you try to take care of things and you know it doesn't matter whatever you do it's they're going to fight you tooth and nail and you know what and you're doing you're doing the dead level best to help them you can take and draw a big chart out and explain this is what we're doing and this is why we're doing it and this is benefiting you it's not benefiting me because you know it's like you go in there and brother going to tell you you know you're working on something that's like listen we got 19 other jobs to do but we're going to take priority and do your job when it doesn't take priority but we're going to do this for you well we got other things that are more important but we're going to help you and then you know what they're you know they'll get in your way they want you know they'll do everything they can just and it's like you know what yeah it's like we just exactly it's a mistake and then you just said okay sorry here you go and you have to move on and it's the same and it's the same thing God will come and he'll speak to you and you'll hear you'll hear a how many times have you heard the prophet say or a minister somebody will be speaking and they'll be speaking to you and you know that the if the Lord is sitting on the Pew with you talking in your ear and he's telling you exactly it's thus saith the Lord and his right to you and you know and you know that the that the Lord is in he's he's it's right to you the only thing that's not been said from the pulpit is your name but you know it's to you and you know and sometimes everybody else in the church or other people in the church know it's for you but sometimes the problem is is when when everything is going right to you and then and then when you get done it's like well who was that for and not realizing the Lord's speaking to you it's thus saith the Lord It's to you and everything he comes right by and speaks to you and speaks to your situation exactly letter perfect to a T and we miss it how many times with brother Brandon standing there and he calling people out and he's calling some sister out in the in the audience and he's talking to her and saying the sister back there and you know he begins to speak and talk to her and tell her the situation and trying to tell her what kind of dress she has on and everything and he begins to pray to the Lord Lord don't let her miss it and in the midst and he calls her name and tells and then she said you know that's for you but you know what gee for some reason maybe she didn't think she had faith enough that for God to speak to her but he's standing there speaking and telling her this is for you this is for you and it's for you and then well I don't I don't know but when but when when when the devil has stood and hindered you over and over and over and over again and you know what I I you know what I I guess you're right Satan I guess you're right but you know what it's like well you know well you know I'm supposed to resist the devil but you know what sometimes he just gets so you know what and it's and it's whoever whoever we're close to sometimes it's our spouse sometimes it's our children sometimes it's our boss sometimes it's our mom and dad and sometimes it's born again believers oh no we don't want we don't well sometimes it is sometimes it's somebody and they're gonna say something to you and you know what they just well make my feelings I'm gonna go home and I'm gonna sit down and I'm just gonna let's go just quit well just keep talking the devil's language he wants you to do that just quit I'm just I'm just I'm just upset nobody nobody appreciates me well you know what that you know hey your brother I'm talking about our life down here is not a flowery bed of ease you're going to have those times and you know what if nobody goes if if the rest of your life nobody ever comes by and Pat you on the back it never tells you that you've done a great job and we appreciate you you know what that's still and not a reason to try to quit amen why because you know what if every gun inhales against you if every devil inhales against you and you got nobody in your corner but you know what you still got almighty God who's still behind you and he's still going to stand there and you know what many times he wants us to stand alone to see if we can stand on our own two feet sometimes you know it's just being a child of God is to raise up just like raising children you know what there's a time you got to get them you can't just carry them around all the time and Pat them on the rear end and just you know just no you can't coddle them you've got to set them down and say listen you got to start learning how to walk stand on your own two feet and you know what they're going to fall down hey you got to get them back up and you know what Sometimes the best thing to do is just let them sit there they'll fall down but you know what sometimes they'll get in their mind it's time to get up all right instead of you trying to scoop them up all the time sometimes you just let them fall down and guess what they'll go somewhere and they'll get on the wall or they'll get to the couch and they'll start pulling themselves up why because we've got to get to the place where it's us and God you know the one of the biggest problems that people had when when the prophet was here was every time they they had every little thing that come along is we got to get in touch with brother Branham and brother Branham standard trying to get people to understand you got to look to Christ it's you in Christ he said I'm not here trying to make myself anything he's not I'm pointing you to Jesus Christ and it's the same way we're pointing the people to Jesus Christ that's what God has come he's wanting to have a relationship with you to the place that you can do these things can we do this yes we can here's here's when when Jesus is there and he's and you know he's standing in there at the at the water at the at the wedding and you know when when his mom Mary comes to him and tells him there's no there's no wine we have we have no wine here and he's like well you know but you know she knew that you need to do something and it's the first thing that you know here he is you're standing there but you know the first thing that she done was she went to Jesus with her problem and that's the first thing you got to do is you got to go to Jesus with your problem they need and he's like you know you know you know what what do you have to do with me you know you know he had never he'd never done any Miracles but you know she was looking to him for a for an answer because and and in which she had such faith that she stood there and she told us that whatever he says for y'all to do just do it and you know they have these the big water pots there that they have for uh you know when they when they entered in that was for them to clean with and you know here they are with those big water pots and you've got different measures and you know there's many things that you can you can look at in the in the types here but you know when to have all these these big water pots and when Jesus comes in and he tells them he said fill those water pots so here they are you know they come and they fill the water pots full here though they're adding all the water well you know they didn't sit around and say well why why are we doing this they need walk you know they they're looking for wine not water well what are we doing these things for I was I was reading a commentary uh by Spurgeon and and Spurgeon was talking about you know it was so amazing when when you look at this situation you know God is only using what's available he said the pots were already there he said water was in abundance there was no shortage of water and so here they are that's what that's what was in front of them that was close by and he said just fill them up brother Branham said that that the wine the water would most likely turn to be turned into wine anyway so he just bypassed all that but you know he wanted them to do something and they didn't they didn't question why are we doing this what's the outcome no just just fill your water pots just fill them up just continue to fill them up and he said you know not just add a little bit more and a little bit more he said fill them up to the brim what does that mean you fill them up until you can't get them more in it the next step is overflowing it put all your can in there just keep filling them keep filling those pots I mean and and so you know what what is the what is the clay pots represents Humanity humans they're six parts what is the is the number of man you know there's different types that we can look at but you know here they are adding adding the water to those pots and you know what they keep adding water into it what is it the water of the word just keep putting it in just keep putting it in keep putting it in and he said when they got when they got to the place where they filled those water pots full then they could dip out but it was it's such a simple thing but you know what that's what God wants us to do that he said you know he said when he was speaking to the disciples and he was telling them he said you know he said these signs shall follow them that belief so if you do what I say do he said then the Miracles will take place but you just follow what I say do and he began to tell them to go out and he said listen he said in my name you'll cast out Devils he said they'll speak with new tongues he said he said he said you can take up service or drink deadly things and none of these things will harm you all of these things but he said go and do all these things so lay hands on the sick they shall recover he said he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also so if you follow all of these things that God has said if you'll follow these then they'll come to pass all you got to do is just believe and he said you know so that you didn't have to have any kind of special training he was speaking of Peter and John you know they didn't have to have an education they didn't have to have anything all they had to do was have confidence in what God Said what Jesus told them and they could go out and do it that's all it took he said you know they didn't have to have anything but you know he said they didn't have to have any they didn't have money because you know Jesus Peter stood there and John stood there and repent Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have I give unto you that's all it took because you know what was given to them is what they could give out that's why they could give out he said in in the name of Jesus Christ why rise up and walk what they told the crippled man why because he had that and he had it because he was what it was given to him but you know what the thing is is it had to be a time that he was filled and you know so as as we were reading earlier you know the more you get full on the things of God you know what then you got to force the devil out you know the old saying that is you know you know God never turns us away empty unless we're full of ourselves you know so if we if we have the things that hinder us you know that's the things we got to get rid of but you know what it takes it takes the filling up on the word it takes it takes the word coming in but you know what you'll never get there if you don't ever if you've never study if you never read if you never pray you know he said how do we get closer to God reading your Bible and praying if you read your Bible and pray if you get into the word then you know what the word is coming because if you have confidence in what you read you know how many times have you sat down and you you're tired you're weary you're upset and you start reading or you start listening to something and all of a sudden the more you begin to listen or the more you begin to read then all of a sudden your attitude begins to change something takes place inside of you that you've got to get rid of you know it's like well listen I'm gonna get up you know because the scripture says that you know when David was going through all of his hard times and his battles and his troubles and everything like that but the scripture says you know he encouraged himself well you know what he didn't what did he do he got away from the people that was hindering him he had to get to the place where it was just him and God you know as as the song says shut in with God in a secret place sometimes you got to get to a place and you know sometimes it's been on the roof of in this in the sun in the middle of the day and you're on the roof working and nobody else is around you but it's you and God sometimes it's driving down the road you get to a place where you get where it's just you and God but you got to get to a place where it's just you and God and you get to a place where God can speak to you and you can speak to God and listen to what he has to say to you and then when will you get to that place then the Lord will speak to you and you begin to you begin to feed on the things of God and you know then all things things begin to change sure right but you know as long as as long as you sit around and you listen to these things and you know I believe brother Rand was telling the story about the the lady that you know you know God had spoken to her and told her she was going to have a child and when when she went through all of that and struggling all that time and her preacher and her husband and all of her family come against her so you're not ever going to have that you know because their problems are too big they're you know all of that he's just some kind of soothsayer he just trying to get your money or just trying to build your build your hopes up all these type things oh and you know and then she came back and been you know apologized to brother Brandon he said but why did God say what did God say did God tell you he's going to have a child well I don't care he didn't know how many Devils whatever said you know what if God promised you that that you know what it's going to come to pass that's the thing about God you know God's not an Indian giver God's Not Too Short God's not God's not going to run out of anything thank you yeah I was just I was thinking this week you know I was I was looking at some things and you know what's so amazing is when you have these people and it's been about three or four times this week I've heard I've heard testimonies from people and and some of them are believers and you know people that are going through different you know going through hard times some people are facing surgeries or different things whatever issues are and it's so amazing because they said at times when when they've got in these situations all of a sudden the Lord has put somebody across their path to speak to them because one sister was telling that you know she's facing a surgery well she met a person that had the exact same surgery and it went great and everything went wonderful everything's been great it's like well the I believe the Lord put her in across my path to encourage my faith because if I got to go this route and praise God there's somebody else this went by that had to go through that same route and people people that have you know financial problems and people that have Wayward loved ones and things that are that they're facing and you know and some of them are people that are believers and they meet somebody that has a need that's facing a situation and it's like they come by and it's like well the Lord put them across my path because I was able to share my testimony with them and share and encourage that person well because if you haven't if you have a need if you've got a problem whatever the situation is you know what there's somebody that's been through that battle before that God has delivered and brought through and you know what some God will put somebody across your path to tell you listen don't quit don't give up don't don't just keep going why because there's what there's a brighter day ahead of you it's just right in front of you God is there to meet your need and many times well I don't know yes he's there and he's wanting to speak to you and tell you he's there and it's available you know there's many times people go through you know Financial hardships and and different problems and different things in their lives and I appreciate brother John and all of his his Sunday school lessons because you know what you know lots of people when you get to talking about money you know people get a little nervous they get a little bit of anxiety but let me tell you something one thing I appreciate about brother John when he gets up here there ain't no lack of faith and there ain't no lack of confidence in what God's done when he gets up here he's so positive why because he has seen God work and when you stand up here and you begin to talk about those things why why is it that people have anxiety about something why because they don't put their confidence in God if you had confidence in God you know what I know what the Bible says about handling money well then guess what then you got to do that but if you do that if you'll follow those principles as brother John was talking about if you've got confidence because I can't handle money and you know you say well I can't handle money if that's if that's your problem then guess what there's a plan in God's Bible that you can follow and guess what God will lead you through and the problem is is you got to put your trust well Lord you got to help me because I can't do this and it's just like well you know I I've got I've got I got a sickness I've got an illness I've got this problem I've got an infirmity whatever it is within you know what then God Is A Healer and then guess what we put our trust and our confidence in him and when you can't get out of bed in the morning then praise God then you know what the Holy Ghost will come and help you get out of the bed but you know what people think that's a joke but you know what that's true but people don't see that I was thinking about sister Dale being in that bedroom when Pop was on the ground when he was on her and Nanny was in there and all of a sudden somebody got him out of the floor and she didn't do it well then you know what there's a miracle that took place so you know what sometimes you know what that he will if God is the one that got him up out of the floor and got him in there then you know what God's the one who took care of him the rest of the time amen if God starts to work in you and already done one miracle though well I I don't know I don't know what's going to take place well you know what I don't have I don't have any worries I don't have any problems but because God's already done one work God's already done one Miracle then you know what he'll do another one he can do all of them but the problem is we just got to keep holding on and keep having faith and keep believing and keep thanking him for what he's done and just keep believing and if we just keep putting our faith in confidence in him then praise God it'll take place you don't want you we don't have to worry about it because God is the one that's in control but see the thing is is you've got to you've got to get to the word you've got to get in the word and the words got to get in you and you've got you've got to be just like that water park you just got to keep pouring the water in keep pouring the water in brother Brandon says and God God in his people he said there's a fountain open flowing freely everywhere just drink till you just can't drink no more the tree if it just drinks to what it was allotment why it was it would all just always still in the drought that's what's the matter with Christians they don't drink enough you want to drink till you just spread out and let everybody else see it say push out get a testimony committed to God believe it step out on it claim God's promise just commit it to God believe it commit thy ways unto the Lord he will bring it to pass whatever you want so if you just keep drinking in and pushing out then you know what as long as you're in the water then you know what it's going to take place because you plant you plant something his brother brother Wade's out playing his garden and everything you know and the water's got to be you know you get out there and you plant and then you hoe and you take care of fertilize and everything but you keep putting the water to it just well put all the seed in the ground and we're going to get out there with a hoe and we're going to hold this Dusty ground well if there's no moisture there then you know what you've stunted the growth you can have the seed you can hear the word and can be planted but if there's no water added to it it's not ever going to come up and you've got to stay in the word and keep adding water to that and if we just keep adding water we keep staying in then guess what it's got to take place you just keep saying it well I don't see a change well praise God just keep staying in it that's right you know because you know if you follow the laws of God then you know what it's got to take place man that's like you go getting this I mean how many of y'all got in the shower and said well you know I've been in here 30 minutes I'm still dry as a bone and I don't know why there's water everywhere but I'm still dry as a bone well no if you get in the presence of God then you know what it's got to do you've got to get into it you've got to get it something's got to take place there's got to be an effect of that so if you're if you're in the presence of God if you're in the word then you know what it's got to start to do a work on you but you know what sometimes we just don't get enough water brother said you know we just get enough water to to you know to get baptized so we get enough to you know pray for our forgiveness of sins but you know we don't stay in it long enough till the Lord comes in and begins to do a work until he begins to push out all these things until if it comes a place where it's everything is taken out foreign God's gifts always find their place when he when he's speaking of what the word is doing when the word comes he says hey here's what it's teaching us he said that God can use every faculty of our being if it's surrendered to him he said we've got to surrender it to him he said he can use our mind our dreams our subconscious our first conscious our tongue our songs our eyes our everything that we have can be used to God if it's committed to God see everything that you are committed to God he'll use every outlet and every part of you he'll use it no matter what it is he'll use it if it's Sanctified for his purpose and calling so if we begin to use these things why because the more we commit and begin to stay in this word and we begin to feed on this word and soak up this word soak up the water then as it takes place and you know what it's got to begin to change it's like well you know I I've been doing this for so long whatever whatever the case may be but you just stay with it you just keep doing God's going to do a work you know people talk about you know Abraham had to wait 25 years for a son you know and and you know and Noah he preached 120 years for for to a generation to see what was going to take place but you know one of the things I I always think about is that man who said at the pool and you know he was there and he had an infirmity well you know brother I've said he wasn't going to die of it but you know what he laid there 38 years now now when when Mo Noah was telling them for 120 years you got to get in the ark or you're going to die you know what it was a life or death situation you know they were there were other people that were in the in the scripture you know what they Moses gave them uh told the children of Israel listen it's a death life or death situation everybody had a lot but you know what this man didn't have a life or death situation but you know what he laid there for 38 years with an infirmity but you know what he had the faith to hold on for 38 years and he still hold on still laid there and kept trying to get up when Jesus come to him and said wilt thou be made whole he said well Lord he said I've got nobody to put me in the water how many times had that the pool had been troubled by the angel how many times did that pull been troubled by the angel and that man struggled to get to the water struggling and when somebody got in ahead of him and he had to walk into feet and he had to crawl back to his mat laying there until the angel came again but you know what he never got he never gave up on that he never he never got tired why because there was a promise in the word and he stayed right there year after year I don't know how often the angel came but you know he laid there for 38 years no it wasn't going to kill him but you know what he gave up 38 years of his life holding on no matter how many you know if if it only had it happened one time that's disheartening but if you're like there and saying that happen two or three times and more and you know here's more people coming maybe maybe more people came to that pool Bethesda and laid around it maybe there was people laying around that pool and end up dying but you know what he laid right there at that pool and he laid right there and he kept waiting for the angel and he saw the the stirring of the water and he got up and he struggled every single time he kept trying to get to the water and you know what and somebody got ahead of him but he laid right there how disheartening was that how heartbreaking is to go through all of that and not get what you want but here come Jesus up to him and said wilt thou be made whole see the one who created the angel that created that created all things was standing in front of him the creator of the angel that came and troubled the waters was standing in front of him and said well thou be made whole he said Lord I'm trying I'm trying right but you know what Jesus didn't ask him about I got no man to get me into what he didn't ask him that he said will thou be made whole do you want to be made whole do you want to see a miracle take place do you want what your desire is 38 years in the making and he said yes then he said well just take up your bed and walk that's what it took when Jesus spoke those words to him then you know he could take Jesus at his word or he could have laid there after he laid there for 38 years having faith in what the scripture what the word said to because he had seen those things take place that that angel would come and Trouble the waters no doubt he'd seen other people come there get in the water and get healed and walk fine whatever they were but you know what it never changed it but you know what he got to the place you know what he's like well you know what I'm going to take him at his word I'm gonna get up maybe he had to scroll maybe he had to crawl over to the wall or slide over to the wall I don't know maybe Jesus helped him up maybe he got up on his own maybe he's all of a sudden you know he got his feet Underneath Him decided I'm going to stand up try this 38 years all of a sudden he's standing on his feet and so many times there are things in our lives that happened and maybe you know it may not be a great thing it's not a Salvation it's you but there's things that you that you know that that you know that are that are not right or you're facing problems and and you know the thing is is and sometimes we can get to the point where we just like well I'm just you know just going to live with it and it's like we don't see a way out we get discouraged by these things we can be just like that man but what about if Jesus was to come by and speak to you wilt thou be made whole well thou be delivered of that will you put your trust in me then we can put our confidence in God and do what he said see this is from perfect strength by Perfect weakness brother Emma speaking and he's talking about having the Holy Ghost he says I just received the Holy Ghost the other night Hallelujah he said you're going to make me do so and so he said God can't use a bit of that he says no whenever you get licked and you realize you're licked then you come back and humble yourself he said get weak you'll find out you're human he said and there's none of you intellectuals can do he said human weakness will never be used of God by the human weakness weaknesses pours themselves into you then he uses himself you just become an instrument certainly you've got to get yourself out of the way so when we get to the places when things happen see we've got to realize we've got weaknesses we've got shortcomings we've got problems but you know what God will work through those things your head because just like that man laying there beside that pool will thou be made whole but Jesus didn't have to drag him over to the pool he wanted him to have faith and confidence in what he said then get up so we have human weaknesses we've got problems we all do we all face things and we're all have complexes and different things that we have to deal with but the thing is is you know what through God will use it when we when he pours himself into those situations Daniel he can work through those you know you know so many times when brother Brandon was standing up and he'd be talking and talking about all the things that he had went through you know temper and the different things that he had been through in his life you know a lot of people they wouldn't have stood up and told all the things brother Branham did I you know because people don't you know I'm not going to tell you all of my shortcomings I'm not going to tell you all my thoughts but you know what brother Brown was an open book and began to tell everybody all the things that that he had done why because he wanted you to understand he was a man just like everybody else he had faults and failures and shortcomings and you know what but you know what God had Grace to bring him through all those things recruit and so the thing is is when you have these shortcomings and God can use he said he said you just become an instrument for God to use you know many times when people stand you know when brother man would be calling a prayer line and he'd be calling people up and you know he'd tell people standing in the prayer line he'd tell them listen if you've got unconfessed sins if you've got a problem he said get out of the line you need to get out of the line but you know what and he told me he said y'all need to make that right and I was listening to a brother the other day and he said you know there's never been a place where brother Branham got up and told him said y'all such horrible people I don't know why y'all even get in the prayer line because y'all know y'all got unconfessed sin and how do you expect God to do anything for you no he told me he said get out of the line and make that right why because God was speaking to them listen there's something that's going to hinder your healing but you need to get whatever you're looking for through from God he said you're here and God can meet your need but the problem is is you know you've got something you need to take care of that and so he didn't try to tell him well don't get in the prayer line no take care of it and get in the prayer line don't let anything hinder you whatever the issue is then let God come on the scene that he can take care of that and if you if you're just allowing then he can work through those things so if you've got any issues it's like brother Brown you know he had faults and failures but you know what he wanted to show the people that that was Grace that God was working through him well why because everybody well you know God spoke that was that was God's mouthpiece and he was a prophet yeah but he was a human being and he went through all the same well you know everybody you know because they try to put brother Bradham in the same category they put Jesus in and you know Jesus Jesus never had a problem well you know what Jesus faced all the problems that you you face all the same Devils he faced all the same thing and brother Brandon did too and guess what and brother Branham was a human and failed but you know what he didn't change who he was he didn't change his ministry all right brother but you know what he had to go and had to go make things right he had to go pray through and he was showing that we got he done those things and you know what he didn't change well you know what brother Brown told a lie I said you know what I just I'm gonna get rid of my books brother Brian I'm hungo hung across from the mirror in his car well I don't know if I can have confidence in him or not William is a human and sometimes we're gonna the devil likes to get those little things and you know he'll he'll the devil will get those things in your mind and he'll roll them around and around and around and around you know you waste the whole day with listening to the things the devil's got to say true he'll be on your shoulder and just and just I mean just oh man it's so draining sometimes but you know sometimes it's good just get in the word just like uh I can't remember who the man's name was the brother but brother I think brother Dale used to talk about that man and he was like well you know the devil always talking to me so well devil we're going to read some of the Bible today let's look over here and we'll read this right here we'll get in and start reading the scripture we'll go read the scripture together now all of a sudden you know what he didn't want to read the scripture anymore why because you know what that was contrary to what he was trying to tell him we're going to get in over here where it's something positive we're going to read something that's good that's what God said we're going to get into this why because that's what God wants us to do it get into this that we can reflect him that we make himself known see we begin to see these things if we can just surrender ourselves our complete being see then we become what God wants us to be he said he says I believe this is from the statue of a perfect man he said see when you surrender your complete being then the Holy Spirit just pours through you and these virtues then you're a living Tabernacle then people look out and say that's a man full of virtue knowledge he believes the word Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness full of the love of the Holy Ghost see there he is walking around what is it a stature that unbelievers can look at and say there is a Christian there is a man or a woman who knows what they're talking about see if we can get to those things where we can get them poured in everything it gets poured in all those virtues all all the the holy spirit all those things get poured in then when you when you get full on those things then you can be used of God then all of a sudden it begins to flow out from you has he talked about those Rivers flowing out see when it begins to overflow and begins then it becomes out just like when they filled those those water pots filled up then they were able to scoop that out and take it and it's like wow what took place it was a miracle but that's what God wants from us Lord let us fill me up Lord that I can teach others Lord that I can be used of God lord fill me up Lord let me empty myself of everything that's not like you to be filled up that we can be given out to be emptied out to those that need it because you know there's one thing God didn't God didn't fill us up just to be full so if God give you know through justification if he takes us and he jumps offer all our past sins and brings us in and through sanctification he cleans us and sets us aside for service that he wants to fill us brother Graham said he wants to fill us to put us in service God just didn't do that just just to have some Us full of the Holy Ghost he wants us to be used for us to be used to be instrumentalities the living breathing instrumentalities of Jesus Christ that the world can see to help those that haven't that have needs that have problems why because you know what you know nobody nobody's going to be able to do it all by themselves it takes one another it takes everybody working together and the main thing is is you know don't get our eyes on somebody else but what you have called me to Lord asked what I want to do it's not big eyes and little use or anything like that but it's to be called to what God has called us to whatever little small part it is if whatever part of the body is that that's what I want to be I want to be a part of the body I want to be effective part of the body of Jesus Christ I want to be the to be full kin use me that can be given out to be emptied out to be poured out upon people that's that's all Stan will have the musicians come I want to I want to sing that song tonight I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more to give why because I want to be full I want to be filled up that I can be given out that I can be emptied out that I can flow that these virtues are in me that they can be given out the people that need strength they can they can draw on us that we can all stand and do the what the part that God has given us to do the journey to come into the full stature of Jesus Christ amen God bless you [Music] um until there's just no more to give I want to love love till there's just no more love I can never ever [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] and me make me more like me Jesus Jesus [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] that's true in love and make me more
