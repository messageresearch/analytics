[50:42] of Matthew and get started now
[50:45] if I pause for a moment
[50:48] I am collecting my boss because I am a
[50:50] southerner and it takes people to think

[51:21] I didn't pay him the same man so
[51:25] you only need to help them
[51:27] in Matthew chapter 17. we will start
[51:31] with first
[51:33] eight unless about eight before we get
[51:35] started did Heavenly Father we pray Lord
[51:37] today yes Lord
[51:39] you would absolutely be the preeminent
[51:41] one in this service
[51:43] do not be a bystander to record our
[51:47] thoughts and actions because lord
[51:48] they're all against you but father you
[51:51] come down and you take over this service
[51:54] yes give me the speaker you be the hero
[51:56] you be the one that does the revealing
[51:58] Lord you be the one that takes over lord
[52:01] from the front to the back we ask your
[52:04] blessings on the people here father the
[52:06] the family members that we we have here
[52:08] in Mobile and the ones that from
[52:10] different parts and yes we pray father
[52:12] that you would bless them today yes
[52:14] brother Matthew Warren bless him
[52:17] Wednesday that have a part in the
[52:20] service board all the way from the front
[52:22] to the back and she'll give them a
[52:24] special blessing amen we pray that
[52:26] you'll be with us today Lord give us the
[52:28] words to speak if there be any sick
[52:29] among us you said you sent your word in
[52:31] heels yes yes and delivered them from
[52:33] their destruction so as the word goes
[52:35] forward many times Lord we've seen you
[52:36] heal people just sitting in their seats
[52:38] father truly that's the way you want it
[52:40] for that's the Gentile way is to just
[52:43] believe and it will happen father
[52:46] forgive us of our sins and many mistakes
[52:48] that we make against you Lord we pray
[52:50] that you would be with the church back
[52:52] home Lord we always thank you that
[52:55] you've been with a missionary on the
[52:56] foreign
[53:04] amen Matthew 17 verse 8. we all know
[53:09] what happened here this was mouth
[53:10] Transfiguration but Jesus comes down off
[53:13] of the mountain and when they had lifted
[53:14] up their eyes they saw an old man
[53:17] say Jesus only and as they came down
[53:21] from the mountain
[53:22] Jesus charged him saying tell the vision
[53:26] to no man until the son of man be risen
[53:29] again
[53:30] from the dead
[53:32] and his disciples
[53:34] obviously were confused they ask him
[53:36] saying
[53:37] wild things they described to the last
[53:39] must first come and Jesus answered and
[53:41] said unto them he lies truly shall first
[53:43] come and restore
[53:46] all things
[53:49] bless you because remember we're going a
[53:51] little bit further and we see that Jesus
[53:54] was speaking of John the Baptist in that
[53:56] scripture but that scripture has a
[53:58] twofold meaning yes and we're talking
[54:01] about now a resurrection and the son of
[54:04] man Jesus said until the sun man be
[54:07] risen again do not speak of this visions
[54:10] of no man so we're going to speak on
[54:13] today though we're going to take a
[54:15] little line uh you know there's many
[54:18] ways to get to New York
[54:20] there's not just one way in a several
[54:22] ways but we're all going to get to the
[54:23] same spot but we may take a little
[54:26] different rap so we're going to speak on
[54:28] today a masterpiece family
[54:31] because
[54:33] obviously in my wife and I were talking
[54:36] on the way you see people that and and
[54:38] not saying anything about denominations
[54:40] uh the people remember brother rounds
[54:43] said do not say anything about the
[54:44] people they're good people it's just the
[54:45] denomination that's got a bound right
[54:47] but remember we had to have a prophet in
[54:49] the end time he come and indicted a
[54:52] generation yes or the second crucifixion
[54:55] of Jesus Christ those people are are
[54:58] worshiping a god of 2 000 years ago they
[55:02] got him off the cross but turned right
[55:04] around and put him back on the cross
[55:05] right amen amen amen so now we see here
[55:09] though that this scripture is being
[55:10] fulfilled because of Son of Man
[55:12] obviously if they crucified him the
[55:14] second time
[55:15] to them he's dead right again
[55:19] the man he's dead absolutely amen you
[55:23] see how the deception is but but Jesus
[55:25] was prophesying until the son of man be
[55:28] risen again amen from the dead yeah man
[55:31] so we're looking at not a physical
[55:33] Resurrection today
[55:38] but a spiritual Resurrection yes all
[55:40] right resurrecting City in the Bible
[55:42] says and how many places all right so
[55:46] we're going to look and see because
[55:48] remember he didn't say until the Son of
[55:50] God be risen again right he said until
[55:52] the son of man be rich amen right
[55:55] because there is a different
[55:57] dispensation it's the same God yes it's
[56:00] the same God but in another
[56:02] manifestation
[56:03] now look the son of God
[56:07] was back in the beginning
[56:10] amen amen amen God was back in the
[56:13] beginning son of man didn't come until
[56:14] 2000 years ago right man that's right so
[56:17] we're looking down as we say again not
[56:20] at a physical Resurrection but a
[56:22] spiritual Resurrection but in turn once
[56:25] that spiritual Resurrection happens it's
[56:27] going to create a natural Resurrection
[56:31] that's right the graves are going to
[56:34] open well actually the graves won't open
[56:36] because it's going to be a secret
[56:43] amen Paul was so full of the Holy Ghost
[56:45] that today that they cut his head off
[56:47] you know when he stepped over over in
[56:49] that sixth Dimension he didn't have to
[56:50] pick his head up off the ground and put
[56:52] it back on his shoulder so that
[56:54] theophany was so strong
[56:57] at the time and there he stood
[57:00] Eternal being with God until I believe
[57:03] that the same way with the resurrection
[57:04] you're not going to have to dig him out
[57:06] of the ground
[57:07] they're going to come up and they're
[57:09] going to be in that glorified body right
[57:11] and if I start preaching Slow Me Down
[57:13] come on
[57:16] Louise you okay back then
[57:19] okay all right
[57:22] let's read the first quote let's get
[57:24] this started here we're going to look to
[57:25] and see two things we're going to look
[57:28] at the Son of God in the son of land is
[57:30] everybody okay
[57:31] all right
[57:33] so one's got to be risen again Son of
[57:35] God can't die Amen brother some God
[57:37] can't die man so a man had to die amen
[57:40] all right brother uh Jesus was very
[57:43] specific when he said the son of man
[57:45] must be risen against right from the
[57:47] dead all right so let's look at the
[57:49] first quote
[57:50] and Watchman one of the night 1960 and
[57:54] I'm going to read this kind of slow I'm
[57:56] gonna we're gonna be here for just a
[57:57] little bit because there's no second
[57:58] service so we're going to pile two
[57:59] anymore
[58:00] amen all right you got anywhere else you
[58:03] need to go no sir okay all right I know
[58:06] what the ball game or something long you
[58:07] might want to watch it

[58:13] stand and never moved
[58:29] if people go fill up a stadium up in
[58:31] Alabama and what do they do they sit
[58:33] there like that
[58:34] no no
[58:35] they screen their lungs out they wear
[58:39] weird clothes yeah and I'm sorry if you
[58:42] think this is where this is a
[58:43] Philippines it's just called the Barone

[1:00:57] what what
[1:00:58] it is
[1:01:00] God in human flesh
[1:01:03] and God would represent himself again in
[1:01:06] human flesh just before the coming of
[1:01:10] the son of man what flesh
[1:01:13] you're fine amen My Flesh word of God
[1:01:16] God coming down from heaven God longing
[1:01:19] for Fellowship yes how people it seems
[1:01:23] to be that there's no there's so much
[1:01:25] mental theology about it you fail to get
[1:01:28] the discernment of the spirit that's
[1:01:31] right amen you're gonna fail to get it
[1:01:33] but God you say oh that was just in
[1:01:35] brother Brown I beg your partner
[1:01:38] this is not a one-man show he bought a
[1:01:41] one-man message there we there will
[1:01:43] never be a message like that before but
[1:01:45] I thought now it was coming to the
[1:01:46] people
[1:01:48] amen
[1:01:49] that's the way I believe that's it
[1:01:51] brother amen I I see people they they
[1:01:55] they're looking for something to come
[1:01:57] it's like my dad always says he said for
[1:01:59] six thousand years man has been trying
[1:02:01] to prove that God's in heaven but for
[1:02:04] six thousand years God's been trying to
[1:02:05] prove it he never left the Earth
[1:02:07] amen
[1:02:09] are we going to heaven or is having him
[1:02:13] Hey listen we're just going to step over
[1:02:15] in the sixth Dimension God's going to
[1:02:16] clean this thing off we're going to step
[1:02:18] right back in here man hey don't
[1:02:20] remember what we lost in the garden when
[1:02:23] God's going to restore well what do we
[1:02:24] have in the garden Adam and Eve was the
[1:02:26] god of the earth amen amen right that's
[1:02:29] right that's a problem with Satan Satan
[1:02:31] so Eve said you'll be like God she
[1:02:34] should have looked at him and said I'm
[1:02:35] already in God that's right amen amen
[1:02:38] right I'm already in God Amen so you'll
[1:02:41] be like going if Adam would have been
[1:02:44] there he just said no I am gone amen
[1:02:46] thank you manifest in another form
[1:02:49] and that's exactly why Adam was that's
[1:02:51] right so without him being that way
[1:02:53] guess what you and I to be restored back
[1:02:57] have got to become the same way amen
[1:03:00] amen you've got to come back to that my
[1:03:02] brothers and sisters back to the
[1:03:05] beginning or the original because
[1:03:07] remember
[1:03:08] Redemption is not replacement that's
[1:03:11] right is that right
[1:03:13] whatever we lost in the garden that's
[1:03:15] what we're going back to yeah and before
[1:03:17] the fall Adam and Eve walk before God
[1:03:20] with no fear they talked to their daddy
[1:03:22] every day amen that's right with no fear
[1:03:26] first time happening in the garden what
[1:03:28] was the first thing Adam said after the
[1:03:29] fall I was afraid yes and answer we got
[1:03:32] to get rid of that fear
[1:03:34] the Fear Factor is this flesh that's
[1:03:37] right amen amen just a little bit we'll
[1:03:40] see though that God uses that flaw
[1:03:44] yes to Perfection because you remember
[1:03:47] people let me give you a little hint
[1:03:51] God always wanted to meet his children
[1:03:54] in human flesh amen yes
[1:03:57] Adam and Eve were in human flesh when
[1:04:01] God talked to them in the cool of the
[1:04:03] day amen amen so we're going back to
[1:04:06] that yeah amen yeah but we're just gonna
[1:04:09] have to take change
[1:04:11] because remember this was brought by Mom
[1:04:13] and Dad not by God Almighty right the
[1:04:16] way it should have been so let's go back
[1:04:18] into the beginning let's go to one of my
[1:04:22] favorite scriptures in the Bible again
[1:04:23] this is one
[1:04:25] 26 and 27 brothers and everything
[1:04:27] started in in book dances right yeah
[1:04:29] that's right and let's break this down
[1:04:32] because we have got to look
[1:04:36] where this masterpiece family came from
[1:04:38] you know if I was the looking brother
[1:04:40] Berlin
[1:04:41] um I'm sure he's got a family album
[1:04:43] bigger than most it probably looks like
[1:04:46] a book of life
[1:04:51] we can laugh a little bit Kim hey yeah
[1:04:54] probably that's it but you know what I'm
[1:04:55] not in it
[1:04:58] why I'm his brother
[1:05:05] but when they have a family reunion why
[1:05:07] do they call why don't you call me when
[1:05:09] we have your family reunion wow
[1:05:13] I'm not part of your family
[1:05:15] physically amen amen right same way with
[1:05:18] God he's not going to invite the devil's
[1:05:20] kids to the family reunion that's right
[1:05:22] that's right man he's only going to buy
[1:05:25] his children amen God's not going to
[1:05:27] adopt the devil's kids are going to
[1:05:29] adopt his children amen amen those
[1:05:31] Devil's kids didn't come from him that's
[1:05:33] right
[1:05:33] that's what we're going back to Genesis
[1:05:36] one and let's read Genesis one
[1:05:38] 26
[1:05:41] through verse 28. let's break this down
[1:05:43] for just a minute
[1:05:44] everybody all right say amen amen got to
[1:05:47] see this origin of this masterpiece
[1:05:48] family because you know where it's going
[1:05:50] to culminate right right here that's
[1:05:51] right amen the devil's going to be
[1:05:54] destroyed here the reason the difference
[1:05:55] in the denomination of the world they
[1:05:57] think we're going to get something bad
[1:06:00] you got to have something here to get
[1:06:01] there with amen all right say he's going
[1:06:04] to be destroyed Redemption doesn't
[1:06:06] happen in heaven Redemption happens on
[1:06:08] Earth
[1:06:09] okay all right so we're all right now
[1:06:12] just having a family reunion today amen
[1:06:16] the origin of this masterpiece family
[1:06:18] Genesis 126 and God said
[1:06:20] let us make man in our image
[1:06:24] after our likeness
[1:06:27] and let them something plural yes sir I
[1:06:30] think in Alabama they teach them as
[1:06:32] plural rights
[1:06:33] there is plural okay all right and let
[1:06:37] them have white demand amen oh the fish
[1:06:40] of the scene over the foul the air and
[1:06:41] over the cattle and over all the earth
[1:06:44] now this is God speaking so it's God
[1:06:45] comes to pass that's right amen the
[1:06:48] Eternal thoughts of God listen you and I
[1:06:49] can change our mind but God cannot
[1:06:51] change
[1:06:52] he has one thought and that thought is
[1:06:54] eternal he has no wasted mood amen you
[1:06:59] and I have a lot of wasted mood God does
[1:07:02] not have any ways to move and he says
[1:07:04] that one time it's going to happen
[1:07:05] so here's God now watch what he's doing
[1:07:08] he's over all the Earth and over every
[1:07:10] creeping thing that creepeth
[1:07:12] on the Earth so God created man in his
[1:07:17] own image
[1:07:18] in the image of God created in him male
[1:07:20] and female
[1:07:22] created in them amen and God blessed
[1:07:25] them now whatever this dream is or
[1:07:27] whatever God is doing he's already
[1:07:29] blessing amen amen amen God bless them
[1:07:33] and God said unto them so he's speaking
[1:07:36] to them yes amen be fruitful and
[1:07:40] multiply and replenish the Earth and
[1:07:42] subdue it yes amen I like that amen they
[1:07:46] have dominion
[1:07:48] over the fish of the scene over the fall
[1:07:50] of the United over every living thing
[1:07:52] that moveth
[1:07:53] upon the Earth
[1:07:56] so let's break it down for that but
[1:07:58] let's read what brother Randall says in
[1:08:00] Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[1:08:03] 1963. yes because now God's secret
[1:08:07] mystery he had before the world began
[1:08:11] now back in the back part of God's mind
[1:08:13] there was something that he was trying
[1:08:16] and was going to achieve that's right
[1:08:19] and he had a motive in doing it amen
[1:08:23] that's it right he had a motive in doing
[1:08:26] it yes man amen why he was possible let
[1:08:28] me just explained that he was father he
[1:08:30] wanted to be impossible without children
[1:08:31] you can't be a father that's right
[1:08:33] that's right amen you can't be a father
[1:08:36] without having children right now so the
[1:08:38] attribute of father was getting ready to
[1:08:40] be displayed here in Genesis 1 26. he
[1:08:43] had a motive in doing in doing it in
[1:08:45] order to let himself be expressed
[1:08:48] because first there wasn't even a moon
[1:08:50] star out of molecule or anything he was
[1:08:53] God
[1:08:54] but he exactly wasn't gone at that time
[1:08:56] because God is an object to worship and
[1:08:59] there was nothing to worship him so in
[1:09:01] his great mind he wanted these
[1:09:02] attributes to be expressed in him was
[1:09:05] love and him was to be father
[1:09:07] and him was to be son and him was to be
[1:09:10] Savior and he wants to be a Healer all
[1:09:12] these great attributes that we see
[1:09:15] already expressed they were already in
[1:09:19] God Amen well that's God's great plan it
[1:09:22] took a prophet of God
[1:09:24] to go back into the mind of God and to
[1:09:27] see exactly what was going on I mean
[1:09:29] exactly didn't listen to us Amen brother
[1:09:31] and sister this message they you may you
[1:09:33] may hear somebody say there's flaws in
[1:09:35] this message but let me tell you
[1:09:36] something the essence of this message is
[1:09:38] absolutely the mind of God made my life
[1:09:42] there's nothing with it the wrong is
[1:09:44] here and it's not here
[1:09:46] right that's what I believe yeah it is I
[1:09:50] don't believe there's any flaw in God
[1:09:52] Amen right
[1:09:54] and there's not another Messenger to
[1:09:56] come so this is it thank you Lord amen
[1:10:00] we're done for it we think there's
[1:10:01] something else coming
[1:10:03] all right so let's break this down just
[1:10:05] a little bit because looking in at
[1:10:07] Genesis 1 26 you're looking it says God
[1:10:09] created
[1:10:11] well in our human mind we look at the
[1:10:13] word created and we think well there's
[1:10:15] nothing and then God created when I look
[1:10:18] if this is the part of God
[1:10:20] and it was created it had a beginning
[1:10:23] it's going to have to have an ending
[1:10:25] that's right
[1:10:27] so this word created is not exactly the
[1:10:30] way you see we see it
[1:10:32] I'm going to explain that because
[1:10:34] remember this Genesis 1 26 man
[1:10:37] is an expression of God himself right
[1:10:40] amen amen not another person that's
[1:10:42] right amen amen as an expression of God
[1:10:45] himself and God said let us make man in
[1:10:48] our image
[1:10:50] so God created man in his own image so
[1:10:53] what's going to look like look like a
[1:10:55] human right amen he's not a he's not a
[1:10:58] Casper the Friendly Ghost he's not a
[1:11:00] blob he's not he's not a yeah sure he
[1:11:02] manifests himself in light and all these
[1:11:04] different things and then clouds but not
[1:11:06] human that's right he's a person only
[1:11:09] human
[1:11:12] praise God well if he's not then you're
[1:11:14] not right because I think you said right
[1:11:16] here he created us any damage amen amen
[1:11:19] all right so God created now that word
[1:11:22] created in the great means to shape
[1:11:24] fashion
[1:11:26] not and so because watch in the Book of
[1:11:30] Genesis we see the word god 30 times in
[1:11:33] Genesis 1. now that word expressed in
[1:11:37] Genesis 1 of God is Elohim self-existing
[1:11:41] one right right so now he's he's
[1:11:43] creating something off of himself and
[1:11:46] he's still God Amen that's right amen so
[1:11:48] this must be a part of God Amen yes not
[1:11:51] a separate identity from God Amen but
[1:11:54] another part of God that he's getting
[1:11:55] ready to express and if you're a part of
[1:11:58] God and you have to be Eternal amen amen
[1:12:01] nothing there's nothing in God if it's
[1:12:04] not Eternal amen amen that's right man
[1:12:07] so if this is the part of God then it's
[1:12:09] Eternal you say well well preacher how
[1:12:10] are you going to get that word created
[1:12:12] you know there was a car in the Garden
[1:12:14] of Eden
[1:12:17] right Michael
[1:12:20] saying amen amen there was a car in the
[1:12:23] garden to me all cars were in the garden
[1:12:26] of me that's right yep right what did
[1:12:29] man do Man created right
[1:12:34] right our fashion our form he took all
[1:12:37] the elements that were already here and
[1:12:40] as everybody understands what happened
[1:12:41] Amen brother this was in the Garden of
[1:12:43] Eden so there's nothing on this Earth
[1:12:46] that wasn't in the earth to start with
[1:12:48] that's right amen God put everything in
[1:12:50] the earth so so Man created the car by
[1:12:54] taking all the plastic and the Rubber
[1:12:56] and the metal and all these oars and all
[1:12:58] these things put together and so what
[1:13:01] does man do man just took something that
[1:13:03] was already here yes and brought
[1:13:06] something into view that you could see
[1:13:08] amen same way with God right we were
[1:13:11] always with God Amen we had it wasn't a
[1:13:13] time when we wasn't with them and they
[1:13:16] said my children were always in me amen
[1:13:19] yes sir amen well if you get a
[1:13:21] revelation
[1:13:23] that's all right amen
[1:13:26] but now look so God created our formed
[1:13:30] man what did he do he brought something
[1:13:32] so that someone can see or understand
[1:13:35] he created man in his own image in the
[1:13:39] image of God created in him male and
[1:13:41] female created in them and God what
[1:13:43] bless them now remember the word image
[1:13:46] the word image is a lightness or a
[1:13:48] reflection yeah if you look in the
[1:13:51] mirror you don't see I don't see this
[1:13:53] brother I see him without because that's
[1:13:55] the image that's projected into the
[1:13:57] mirror so that's the way God was because
[1:13:58] I believe when God went down and talked
[1:14:01] to Adam and Eve before the fall
[1:14:03] I believe Adam will look at him and say
[1:14:05] man I look just like it
[1:14:08] I guess they'll start my day amen what
[1:14:12] do you think it sounds like that's my
[1:14:15] dad amen
[1:14:17] and God looks down at Adam and says
[1:14:19] that's my boy he walks and talks just
[1:14:22] like me amen if I like what brother
[1:14:24] Elise was preaching his church the other
[1:14:25] day he said uh Adam was so in tune with
[1:14:28] God that that when Adam you know Adam
[1:14:31] starts naming the animals God's going no
[1:14:33] no no no no don't paint that elephant no
[1:14:36] no no uh when Adam said that's an
[1:14:38] elephant God said that's exactly what I
[1:14:39] was thinking
[1:14:41] man that's exactly what I'm about it
[1:14:52] back to when we speak it's exactly right
[1:14:55] now the problem is is we filter it down
[1:14:59] and say what we want exactly we say what
[1:15:02] we want to say and all right God's
[1:15:03] already said amen so we got to take what
[1:15:06] God's already said get it down here so
[1:15:08] you and I that's why the son of man's
[1:15:10] got to be here right amen amen amen not
[1:15:13] Immortal flesh but in your flesh yes
[1:15:16] everybody all right say amen yeah
[1:15:19] Bible says God bless them verse 28
[1:15:22] blessed means to be blessed or be adored
[1:15:25] to praise I love my children yeah
[1:15:28] yeah okay how bad they are
[1:15:30] awesome they're mine they came from me
[1:15:32] God's the same way
[1:15:35] he'll never ask you how long it took you
[1:15:36] to come to church
[1:15:38] he'll just say thank God I knew you were
[1:15:40] coming yeah
[1:15:42] he knows the days that you're going to
[1:15:44] make it so don't worry about that
[1:15:45] but then he keeps talking he said God
[1:15:48] said and then be fruitful
[1:15:51] wow now anything being fruitful means is
[1:15:54] to have a lot of children obviously you
[1:15:57] have that Revelation down here
[1:16:18] we're doing the same thing at our place
[1:16:20] you know we got some of the borderline
[1:16:21] people up here
[1:16:25] see what you started
[1:16:29] be fruitful the Bible says this is from
[1:16:33] the original and the Greek it says to
[1:16:35] show fruitfulness or to bear fruit
[1:16:38] amen be fruitful
[1:16:41] bear fruit in other words loud joy peace
[1:16:45] long suffering that's what we're that's
[1:16:47] actually the characteristics of God if
[1:16:49] we I have the characteristics of my
[1:16:50] father because I have the gene of my
[1:16:52] father inmate amen amen
[1:16:54] that's the mess up I have the gene of my
[1:16:57] natural father and me what we got to do
[1:16:58] is get the genome
[1:17:01] and then you know what we'll start
[1:17:03] acting like the rest of the family
[1:17:06] and the Bible says you have two sets to
[1:17:09] multiply that's another thing it says to
[1:17:12] become great
[1:17:14] not just to multiply in number but to
[1:17:17] become great God is bestowing all these
[1:17:20] blessings and you know what he hadn't
[1:17:22] put them in human flesh yet that's right
[1:17:24] amen that's right yeah yeah and he put
[1:17:26] him in human flesh in Genesis 1 26 this
[1:17:28] is a spirit man's gospel all right amen
[1:17:30] amen to lead to leave the animals the
[1:17:33] prophet of God said just like the Holy
[1:17:35] Spirit leads the people today and I
[1:17:38] believe that's what he was and amen amen
[1:17:40] but multiply become great
[1:17:43] the Bible says too he says to replenish
[1:17:45] fullness abundance what's he telling you
[1:17:49] to do multiply replenish the Earth and
[1:17:51] subdue it
[1:17:52] Adam had complete dominion over this
[1:17:55] Earth yes God in other words says look
[1:17:57] Adam I'll Take Care Of Heaven you take
[1:17:59] care of her I'm going to be the BG and
[1:18:02] you can't be the big Gene but you beat a
[1:18:04] little kid amen amen Adam gave me a
[1:18:07] little big G but he loves you because
[1:18:09] God told him to be a little bit right
[1:18:10] and when God spoke it it's got to happen
[1:18:12] amen amen what happened was is we got
[1:18:15] lost in the fall right and that Dominion
[1:18:18] are the title deed if you want to call
[1:18:21] it is that okay
[1:18:22] Adam lost the title Deeds right in other
[1:18:25] words Adam lost the family album that's
[1:18:28] right right yeah amen got it right it
[1:18:31] wasn't a title
[1:18:33] you want a title that you hand somebody
[1:18:35] says no God told Adam right here to
[1:18:39] multiply and replenish the Earth and
[1:18:41] subdue it and have dominion right so
[1:18:43] that's what God wanted Adam to do amen
[1:18:45] well when Adam lost that in the fall God
[1:18:47] said okay buddy son you can't do that
[1:18:50] anymore nothing can come through to you
[1:18:54] but death all right and that's all right
[1:18:57] nothing can come through you but there
[1:18:58] but I'm gonna come back amen I'm going
[1:19:02] to actually take that book in my bosom
[1:19:05] and I'm going to hide it amen
[1:19:09] I'm gonna take that book and I'm the
[1:19:12] father it's my book to start with amen
[1:19:15] amen amen I'm the head of the family
[1:19:18] I was just going to give my son
[1:19:20] responsibility to bring this in into
[1:19:22] being but you can't do it anymore son
[1:19:25] I'm gonna have to do it all right man
[1:19:28] because remember Adam got out and
[1:19:30] thought he could say good evening the
[1:19:31] prophet of God said he found out when he
[1:19:33] got out he couldn't get back in why he
[1:19:35] wanted to be a kid right yeah he was a
[1:19:38] little kid that's right there was no
[1:19:40] attribute in Adam to be a savior that's
[1:19:42] right Adam couldn't give his life for
[1:19:45] anything right amen right only God can
[1:19:48] do that
[1:19:49] so the VG had to come amen amen the seed
[1:19:52] of a woman God but
[1:19:55] is everybody okay because I can skip a
[1:19:57] lot of clothes if you can understand
[1:19:58] what this Genesis 126. it's a spirit man
[1:20:01] or brother round calls it a theophany
[1:20:04] right man which is God being able to be
[1:20:07] seen what God's doing he's condescending
[1:20:09] cutting down so that our finite mind can
[1:20:13] understand an infant of God Amen that's
[1:20:15] right see in our finite mind we don't
[1:20:18] know how many kids we're going to have
[1:20:19] but God is in for the Mind looked down
[1:20:21] two times last time I preached here on
[1:20:23] on uh foreknowledge God form you right
[1:20:27] then he could predestinate amen and
[1:20:29] that's what had to be foreign knowledge
[1:20:31] first and then he could look down
[1:20:33] through time see where all of his
[1:20:35] children would land and he'd just say
[1:20:37] okay that's what it's going to be
[1:20:39] but I'm gonna have to come and redeem
[1:20:41] that group of people amen because they
[1:20:43] can't save theirself right how many of
[1:20:46] us saved ourselves I didn't think so sir
[1:20:49] amen you can't save yourself amen amen
[1:20:52] but you know what the father can say to
[1:20:54] you amen father can come and do it he's
[1:20:57] not the power amen so he's a daddy he's
[1:21:00] the one that we came from amen everybody
[1:21:03] all right say amen amen all right so we
[1:21:06] can skip a few of these quotes here then
[1:21:08] that'll help us get along and it won't
[1:21:09] be three or four o'clock when we get
[1:21:11] finished
[1:21:12] let's read one
[1:21:15] questions in actions 1953 brother Louise
[1:21:19] you've been okay back there
[1:21:20] okay everything's fine I think he's good
[1:21:23] he can he can handle it
[1:21:25] he's a good addition to our church in
[1:21:26] other words
[1:21:28] we praise God he insisted Christine and
[1:21:31] the girl with his fit right in so great
[1:21:33] yeah God orchestrates this penis he puts
[1:21:37] it together
[1:21:38] questions asked for 1953 so now God
[1:21:41] created man his own image in his own
[1:21:43] likeness what kind of man did he create
[1:21:44] a spirit man
[1:21:46] now you'll notice after he made all the
[1:21:48] creation and created Spirit man the
[1:21:50] close reading of this now to the one
[1:21:52] that asked the question will find it
[1:21:53] that God gave Dominion of the cattle and
[1:21:55] fish and everything to the man but in
[1:21:57] his making up there he made man in his
[1:21:59] own image to lead the cattle to lead the
[1:22:02] beasts of the field just like the Holy
[1:22:04] Spirit leads the Believers today amen
[1:22:08] now listen I do not believe when I
[1:22:10] thought said that we were back there
[1:22:11] with God we were in God in gene form we
[1:22:15] were not back there as Souls
[1:22:30] he said you were nothing
[1:22:33] all right
[1:22:34] you were laughing that makes you feel
[1:22:36] good
[1:22:37] but only in God Amen that's right God's
[1:22:41] Great mind he had us in his mind in gene
[1:22:45] form amen because the only way I can
[1:22:48] produce children is by my genetics all
[1:22:51] right amen they say I walk like my
[1:22:53] grandfather well mine doesn't fall like
[1:22:55] my grandfather because he doesn't have
[1:22:56] my grandfather's jeans in it but I have
[1:22:58] my grandfather's jeans the only way I
[1:23:00] can see this brothers and sisters is to
[1:23:01] look natural that's right amen so look
[1:23:04] at the natural the things we see in the
[1:23:06] natural that's right of being a father
[1:23:08] and being a son and having the
[1:23:10] attributes of my dad
[1:23:13] amen same thing when you get the new
[1:23:15] birth that brings the attribute so if
[1:23:18] you're a real God yeah the way we should
[1:23:21] imagine well the one that Adam and Eve
[1:23:24] was going to be able to produce amen
[1:23:26] amen but God so preserve this or the
[1:23:29] prophet of God said God took a picture
[1:23:31] of you hallelujah amen for the
[1:23:34] foundation of the world let's read that
[1:23:36] from 9964 questions and answers
[1:23:40] Steve
[1:23:42] but this picture is the main thing
[1:23:45] then in the resurrection those gases and
[1:23:48] acids and things comes right back into
[1:23:50] the place and develops this picture
[1:23:52] again
[1:23:54] now this picture was not taken when you
[1:23:57] was 16 or 18.
[1:23:59] right yeah R20 that's your best when was
[1:24:03] it taken
[1:24:04] before there was a foundation of the
[1:24:06] world
[1:24:07] it was put in God's Great file our
[1:24:11] family album amen because only his kids
[1:24:14] are in his album right right amen and
[1:24:17] then only thing it did was featured
[1:24:20] itself here for you to make your choice
[1:24:24] amen amen
[1:24:26] but by for knowledge he knew what choice
[1:24:29] you would make so therefore
[1:24:30] predetermined amen amen
[1:24:35] amen because that looks like you're
[1:24:37] going down a straight line you can't do
[1:24:38] anything different no
[1:24:40] you still got a choice so you're still a
[1:24:42] free more agent even after you're born
[1:24:44] again you got free moral agency you can
[1:24:46] go by the Graver you can take a body
[1:24:47] chain you listen to the word of you
[1:24:49] that's right amen amen better choice
[1:24:51] today
[1:24:52] amen but the picture is the main thing
[1:24:55] then you become a servant of God him for
[1:24:57] knowing it makes him a redeemer as we've
[1:25:01] been through it now that picture is in
[1:25:03] God's Great Gallery up there
[1:25:07] we're preserved in God
[1:25:09] there's no way you can't make it if
[1:25:11] you're already in that album amen amen
[1:25:14] but it's because of what he saw you do
[1:25:16] when you got here listen even Cain could
[1:25:20] be saved yeah
[1:25:22] that's right
[1:25:25] the people in the nation don't believe
[1:25:26] that I do
[1:25:28] because it's a Bible amen the Bible says
[1:25:31] if you'll do as your brother that's
[1:25:33] exactly right you will be accepted sure
[1:25:36] God and you came wasn't going to do it
[1:25:37] right but he had to give him a choice
[1:25:39] that's right brother Matthew there's no
[1:25:42] way God can be just
[1:25:44] because he's the greatest judge that
[1:25:45] ever lived right but remember we can go
[1:25:48] to a court and a judge can do things
[1:25:49] wrong but you go to the court of God
[1:25:52] that's right he's already seen you do it
[1:25:54] amen amen he's already seen it happen
[1:25:56] amen that's right all right so he knows
[1:25:59] what's going to he knows how to judge
[1:26:00] and he could be a judge you can't come
[1:26:02] up to the white Throne judgment and God
[1:26:04] condemned this one and save this one if
[1:26:06] this one doesn't say Lord you never
[1:26:09] never
[1:26:10] he said yes I did they'll give you the
[1:26:13] date and the hour that he came to you to
[1:26:16] try to save your soul
[1:26:19] that's right and he'll stay there before
[1:26:21] you turn me down amen if not then he did
[1:26:24] choose one over the other and he can't
[1:26:26] do that not may have just thought he
[1:26:28] cannot do that amen so it is your choice
[1:26:31] amen I don't care who you think you are
[1:26:33] absolutely it's still your choice that's
[1:26:34] right brother Brown had a choice he had
[1:26:37] to be born again yes right amen a lot of
[1:26:40] the Prophet oh he's born in private but
[1:26:42] he hadn't been born again amen
[1:26:44] absolutely right brother
[1:26:46] you must be born again right
[1:26:49] if any Born Again puts you in this
[1:26:51] family that's right but remember
[1:26:54] now let's just look
[1:26:56] Adam lost the ability in the Garden of
[1:26:58] Eden
[1:26:59] but all wasn't lost
[1:27:02] the father takes the book yes he does
[1:27:05] and he holds on to that book Thank God
[1:27:07] but he presents that book in the Old
[1:27:09] Testament and types and shouting that's
[1:27:11] right amen that's right he comes down as
[1:27:13] Melchizedek what theophany amen amen
[1:27:17] amen that's something of God that's not
[1:27:20] the son of man that was the son of God
[1:27:21] that's right that's right amen amen
[1:27:24] gotta get a little slow here the Son of
[1:27:26] God is the creator that's the Son of God
[1:27:28] before the foundation of the world
[1:27:29] that's the creator of God amen amen amen
[1:27:32] amen that's the spirit God the Holy
[1:27:34] Ghost amen that's right amen right son
[1:27:37] of man is the one that was put in flesh
[1:27:38] right man it's not a man is God in human
[1:27:41] flesh right so the sun god in Revelation
[1:27:45] was even in the Old Testament in types
[1:27:48] and shadows but he did come down for one
[1:27:49] moment just to show the faith Seed of
[1:27:53] Abraham that in a final end we're gonna
[1:27:55] have to meet that same person just like
[1:27:57] Abraham about that man yes but
[1:28:01] that man couldn't say to Abraham
[1:28:04] yes amen
[1:28:07] it's good brother no Cassidy could not
[1:28:10] save Abraham that's right amen
[1:28:13] because it was a created body that's
[1:28:15] right now what happened in the fall
[1:28:17] proves that that created body couldn't
[1:28:19] save us yes it had to be born of a woman
[1:28:23] for a woman pollution came that's where
[1:28:26] it had to be cleaned as it came through
[1:28:29] amen but that was Melchizedek yeah that
[1:28:32] was God in human flesh sir for one
[1:28:35] moment meeting Abraham amen amen amen so
[1:28:39] and then what do you do you just step
[1:28:40] right back into eternity left that flesh
[1:28:43] just dust just go right back to the
[1:28:45] Earth man so that couldn't be your
[1:28:47] savior or Redeemer because remember Adam
[1:28:49] didn't felt didn't fall in his soul he
[1:28:51] fell in his excuse me fell in his flash
[1:28:53] right yeah the flesh is what had to be
[1:28:56] redeemed come on Amen listen the song
[1:28:59] God doesn't need Redemption that's right
[1:29:01] that's right
[1:29:03] he never sinned today hey let me give
[1:29:06] you one more thing here Genesis 1 26 man
[1:29:08] never sinned the day in his life
[1:29:11] this is 126 man
[1:29:17] that's right
[1:29:33] because remember the Holy Ghost came on
[1:29:35] the damn Pentecost but they didn't have
[1:29:37] enough Revelation yes to get this man
[1:29:39] changed amen right amen why well David
[1:29:43] took a Rapture if you didn't all right
[1:29:44] yeah amen Rapture right Praise You Lord
[1:29:48] the Raptor's here yeah man this is a
[1:29:50] Rapture because the revelation of the
[1:29:52] son of man God in human flesh has to be
[1:29:55] here Lord God Amen property of God see
[1:29:58] God in your flesh though that's right
[1:30:00] but in my flesh
[1:30:02] Amen brother praise God is that good
[1:30:05] that's good amen now
[1:30:08] it was one of my second most favorite
[1:30:10] scriptures let's go to Isaiah 53. amen
[1:30:14] 53. so let's look Adam lost the book
[1:30:18] that's right why you turning Adam lost
[1:30:21] the book of eternal life amen amen amen
[1:30:23] no one came Eternal lack Rider
[1:30:26] amen hello hey man any Old Testament
[1:30:29] they didn't even have the new birth they
[1:30:31] had an anointing of the Holy Ghost right
[1:30:33] right amen that's right a lot of
[1:30:35] information don't believe that I no
[1:30:36] Abraham's not a son of God
[1:30:42] show me in the Bible where he said the
[1:30:44] Bible calls him a friend of God right
[1:30:46] they had an anointing of the Holy Ghost
[1:30:48] goes around people the blood of bulls
[1:30:50] and goats couldn't get in that soul and
[1:30:52] say that okay
[1:30:54] the blood of wolves and goats can't save
[1:30:56] you it just pushes your sin to Calvary
[1:30:59] now when Calvary happened they go back
[1:31:02] and say Abraham your faith has saved you
[1:31:06] Isaiah Joseph all those ones in the Old
[1:31:09] Testament absolutely God in faith but in
[1:31:12] in the book of of Hebrews 11 it says
[1:31:15] they die not receiving the promise
[1:31:18] that's right what is the promise in your
[1:31:21] soul amen amen not an anointing the
[1:31:23] anointing to come on David and David
[1:31:25] could prophesy in the first person just
[1:31:27] like he was hanging on the cross that's
[1:31:29] right and when Adam million would come
[1:31:30] off from David you think David had the
[1:31:31] Holy Ghost in his soul no no the way the
[1:31:34] reason he didn't have the Holy Ghost in
[1:31:35] his soul swing had spring killed right
[1:31:37] that's right right and committed
[1:31:39] adultery right yeah probably go spilled
[1:31:41] person wouldn't do that that's right
[1:31:42] amen all right so God preserve that
[1:31:46] because remember
[1:31:48] Jesus the first sermon he preached
[1:31:52] was the Kingdom of Heaven is in hand yes
[1:31:55] amen and he said look he said the least
[1:31:57] in this kingdom is greater than John the
[1:32:01] Baptist praise God
[1:32:03] the least the weakest the weakest Born
[1:32:06] Again believer is greater than John the
[1:32:09] Baptist so they had an anointing on
[1:32:12] their flesh and God honored their faith
[1:32:15] but they are not the children of God
[1:32:20] in the Old Testament no they died in
[1:32:24] faith looking what even Paul Paul stands
[1:32:27] and looks in Hebrews 11 40 and he says
[1:32:29] they without us yes that's right they
[1:32:32] without us cannot be made white perfect
[1:32:35] amen I believe if you have the new birth
[1:32:37] today you're perfect amen so if they
[1:32:40] didn't have the new birth
[1:32:41] but when you come over to hear Paul says
[1:32:45] they without us cannot be made perfect
[1:32:47] amen
[1:32:51] all right Paul became obey
[1:32:54] him again you're laughing the rest over
[1:32:56] here
[1:32:58] because Paul said that that's right they
[1:33:01] without us when Paul died he became
[1:33:04] available because you walk over here
[1:33:05] today and you say they without us cannot
[1:33:08] be made perfect amen they can't come out
[1:33:10] of that great without you and I come
[1:33:12] into Perfection
[1:33:14] Hallelujah Isaiah 53 9 and he made his
[1:33:17] grave with the wicked right

[1:33:34] word says that's right
[1:33:36] it's great with the wicked
[1:33:40] and with the rich in his death
[1:33:42] because he had done no violence
[1:33:45] neither was any deceit in his mouth
[1:33:48] praise God look at Isaiah 53 10.
[1:33:52] get it please the Lord and bruise him
[1:33:56] he have put him to grief
[1:34:00] when thou shalt make his soul his soul

[1:35:17] have plenty of degree when thou shalt
[1:35:19] make his soul and offering for sin when
[1:35:21] did he do that at Calvary right again
[1:35:23] the soul of God was in that man
[1:35:26] amen and that soul of God is where that
[1:35:29] seed comes from us right and man not my
[1:35:31] natural ones of a man you know I come by
[1:35:33] the spoken word of God amen amen
[1:35:36] that's why I always say Jesus hung there
[1:35:39] from six o'clock you know I mean from
[1:35:41] four o'clock three o'clock six o'clock
[1:35:44] yeah you know mine you get a call
[1:35:48] overnight you can't call over two of his
[1:35:51] name
[1:35:52] he was on the cross yeah I was always
[1:35:55] mine don't worry he wasn't dying for
[1:35:57] himself amen he didn't have to die
[1:35:59] that's right he was dying for me
[1:36:02] he was dying for him for his children
[1:36:04] because we were bottled up inside of
[1:36:06] that man called Jesus and there's no way
[1:36:07] for us to get out thank God thank you oh
[1:36:10] God unless he gave his soul an offering
[1:36:13] for sin yeah he shall see his seed
[1:36:15] praise God for his Gene his genetics his
[1:36:19] children he shall prolong his days in
[1:36:21] the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper
[1:36:23] in his hand
[1:36:25] he shall see the travail of his wife
[1:36:27] Soul yes and shall be satisfied
[1:36:31] by his knowledge shall my righteous
[1:36:33] servant justify many for he shall bear
[1:36:35] their iniquity thank God
[1:36:37] therefore Elijah divide him a portion
[1:36:40] with the great and he shall divide the
[1:36:42] spoil of the strong because he had
[1:36:43] poured out his soul
[1:36:46] unto death now listen God didn't die
[1:36:50] your soul don't die when you leave this
[1:36:52] world Amen that's right yes that's right
[1:36:54] amen amen amen right somebody said one
[1:36:56] time my God can't die but my God played
[1:36:58] the active part of that sure coaching
[1:37:01] again right here he says what shall pour
[1:37:03] out his soul unto death
[1:37:06] he played the part of death you can't
[1:37:08] kill God I can't kill brother Matthew
[1:37:10] like I said about Paul they chopped his
[1:37:12] head off right he was more alive than he
[1:37:15] was when he dropped his head off
[1:37:17] the soul inside of him was so much more
[1:37:19] real in them than the man that they take
[1:37:21] his head off like I said I didn't have
[1:37:23] to pick his head up that's right crazy
[1:37:25] man it's good bro
[1:37:28] you love more
[1:37:31] he poured out his soul unto death and he
[1:37:34] was numbered with the transgressors and
[1:37:35] he bore the sin of many and made an
[1:37:37] intercession to the transgressive and we
[1:37:39] don't want to happen on Friday when
[1:37:40] Jesus was crucified
[1:37:43] prophet of God said God tore that soul
[1:37:45] out of that man well you know what the
[1:37:46] body died that's right that was our
[1:37:49] sacrifice that was the lamb that was the
[1:37:51] sacrifice the flesh was the sacrifice
[1:37:54] the flesh took the Strife God never took
[1:37:57] a Strife in his soul he took the stripes
[1:37:59] in his body for me and you his soul came
[1:38:02] out of the body but now remember one
[1:38:04] thing
[1:38:05] he wasn't finished Hallelujah that's
[1:38:08] right
[1:38:08] probably God said his work wasn't done
[1:38:10] that's right and I want to announce
[1:38:12] something to you today
[1:38:14] when he went to hell
[1:38:16] Caprice for those souls in prison I went
[1:38:20] with him that's right so you've already
[1:38:23] been to him you ain't got to go to hell
[1:38:25] no more you've already been there amen
[1:38:28] if you were in that theophany drive
[1:38:31] right yes
[1:38:34] Jesus when he went to hell you went with
[1:38:37] him and you don't have to go again
[1:38:38] because he's already paid prize
[1:38:41] his soul a ransom glory to God amen amen
[1:38:45] he'd have to pay dollars he paid it with
[1:38:47] his life he said my children now will be
[1:38:50] set free Satan you'll have any property
[1:38:52] you don't own anything you don't have

[1:38:58] come back 10 days later yes oh we love
[1:39:01] the resurrection I love it I love the
[1:39:03] resurrection but if he had to come back
[1:39:05] 10 days later in the hearts of them
[1:39:06] people that's right his job was not
[1:39:09] complete that's right but he did brother
[1:39:11] he 10 days later on today of Pentecost
[1:39:13] they were in that Upper Room sir Amen
[1:39:15] brother around and say God sent his soul
[1:39:18] back in the form of the Holy Ghost and
[1:39:20] filled those Believers with the Holy
[1:39:22] Ghost listen I've always said Satan if
[1:39:25] he would have left Jesus alone he would
[1:39:27] have only had to fight one Jesus so when
[1:39:30] he killed Jesus 10 days later that was
[1:39:33] 128. Amen in the next
[1:39:37] sermon then three thousand little Jesus
[1:39:39] said man he's having a fifth having a
[1:39:43] heart attack himself he's going what I
[1:39:45] killed one and I've already got 3120
[1:39:47] Amen in one day
[1:39:50] Hallelujah compared to the church ages
[1:39:53] look at the millions of little Jesus is
[1:39:54] the same time to deal with he's bless
[1:39:56] his heart
[1:40:12] oh sure he's got his own thing that's
[1:40:15] right but it's not part of God yeah man
[1:40:17] get on the Lord amen man you gotta love
[1:40:20] him because he gave his soul of Ransom
[1:40:22] he actually sent his soul to hell yes he
[1:40:25] did for me and you that's right you know
[1:40:28] what we can't take ours down there so
[1:40:31] Satan says hey I got a little I got
[1:40:33] something I got to talk to you about but
[1:40:34] when God walks down there in Saint Lucie
[1:40:37] gone he's like hey man I really don't
[1:40:40] want you now yeah that's right that's
[1:40:41] right I don't want to talk to you
[1:40:43] anymore
[1:40:44] that's what I've always said you know
[1:40:46] Jesus in human flesh he's walking he
[1:40:48] looks at Legion and all those demons you
[1:40:50] know we I've always told the brothers in
[1:40:53] church I said look don't ever negotiate
[1:40:54] with the demon right
[1:40:59] when Jesus walks up to Legion the first
[1:41:02] thing they said to him was that's right
[1:41:04] Son of God why are you here amen I've
[1:41:08] always said the devil knew who God was
[1:41:10] but when he walked in front of the
[1:41:11] Pharisees the religious people today
[1:41:13] they said you're a devil all right
[1:41:15] right Pharisees is your devil Jesus and
[1:41:18] and Jesus walks out in front of a legion
[1:41:20] for the devils and they said you're the
[1:41:22] Son of God right what are you doing here
[1:41:24] before our time
[1:41:26] but you know what they felt that Spirit
[1:41:29] yes they did they felt that Spirit they
[1:41:31] knew that Spirit of Jesus Christ was
[1:41:33] more powerful than anything amen
[1:41:46] into the hearts of the blue
[1:41:48] now
[1:41:50] the son of God
[1:41:52] was the creator amen I still is I say
[1:41:55] was here's the Creator God Amen And that
[1:41:57] son of God moved into a
[1:42:00] a realm of Flesh
[1:42:02] Hebrews 10 5 a body down has prepared me
[1:42:05] right so the Son of God is in that flesh
[1:42:08] and that's called the son of man
[1:42:10] right yeah let's go back up just a
[1:42:12] little bit here with Jesus because that
[1:42:14] was he was the son of man right he
[1:42:16] wasn't a song man he was decent man yeah
[1:42:18] he was Big G in human flesh amen amen
[1:42:22] remember back he was BG he wasn't he had
[1:42:27] full control so he was Benji and human
[1:42:30] flesh so here's the son of man walking
[1:42:32] on the Earth
[1:42:34] showing and what happened in the parable
[1:42:36] in there in Matthew 13 is where remember
[1:42:39] he said a sword goes out to Soul he said
[1:42:41] who's the sower he said the son of man
[1:42:42] what's the seed the seed as to what
[1:42:45] children of the Kingdom you and I are
[1:42:47] the children of the kingdom and I am is
[1:42:50] that true say Amen are the children of
[1:42:52] what the family we're the family members
[1:42:54] amen so actually Jesus had to come here
[1:42:57] to show the word into the Earth because
[1:42:59] what are we feeding off of what are we
[1:43:01] living off of you and I'm a weak okay
[1:43:03] when we uh I don't like to say God the
[1:43:06] Holy Ghost but you get the Holy Ghost
[1:43:07] the other day you're alive and die and

[1:47:39] saying a prophet stands before no one
[1:47:41] except God himself amen amen so if you

[1:47:48] them right

[1:47:58] to God that's exactly man you have super
[1:48:01] seated that and come around and say oh
[1:48:03] brother Brown's wrong or didn't he
[1:48:16] Jesus Christ
[1:48:19] 1961 brother rammsteady breaks the seal
[1:48:22] reveals gives us gives us his
[1:48:25] inheritance to his people he gives the
[1:48:28] inheritance that he inherited yes amen
[1:48:32] amen becoming kinsman redeemer because
[1:48:35] remember he did inherit flesh right
[1:48:38] amen amen amen amen and freely gives it
[1:48:42] out to us it all belongs to him
[1:48:45] he was the one who redeemed but instead
[1:48:48] of keeping it himself he gives it back
[1:48:50] to the people
[1:48:53] oh what a great father yeah thank you
[1:48:57] Jesus what a horrible father even the
[1:48:59] Bible says that if a son asks for a fish
[1:49:01] and you give him a stone right right oh
[1:49:03] no we got a father that he knew what we
[1:49:05] wanted before we wanted it
[1:49:07] already there before we need it
[1:49:10] everybody all right say amen amen but
[1:49:13] here we look excuse me the apostles and
[1:49:17] we see we go back to our scripture in
[1:49:18] Matthew where the son of man be risen
[1:49:20] again because we know that some man died
[1:49:22] two thousand years ago and that's what
[1:49:24] the world is celebrating the
[1:49:27] resurrection of that man
[1:49:30] right man
[1:49:32] but somewhere he got buried again
[1:49:35] yeah yes if if brother Bradham indicted
[1:49:39] the generation for the crucifixion of
[1:49:41] Christ they killed him again brother
[1:49:43] Ryan said put into an open shame so
[1:49:45] obviously if they killed him they had to
[1:49:47] bury him right that's why Jesus said the
[1:49:50] son of man had to be risen again from
[1:49:52] the dead and Elijah had to come and
[1:49:55] restore all things so we're sitting
[1:49:57] right in the middle of this
[1:49:58] of this resurrection of the son of man
[1:50:01] amen amen amen the Risen again but what
[1:50:05] is it it's the family members of God
[1:50:07] that's right it's not the devil's kids
[1:50:10] listen it this wasn't for Luther
[1:50:15] I'm sorry but I'm going to make a
[1:50:18] statement Luther couldn't preach this
[1:50:19] message today
[1:50:21] amen that's true Right Wesley didn't
[1:50:23] preach this message like I'm preaching
[1:50:25] by the way
[1:50:36] even Peter when Jesus looked at Peter
[1:50:39] and I know this may be controversial but
[1:50:40] you know what I'm controversial I just
[1:50:42] don't like to be normal
[1:50:47] I'm not normal okay
[1:50:50] but Jesus asked Peter a question said
[1:50:55] who your man say I the son of man am
[1:50:59] right
[1:51:00] Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son
[1:51:03] of the Living God that's right right
[1:51:06] Peter only had a son of God in
[1:51:08] Revelation he did not answer that
[1:51:10] question the way Jesus presented it to
[1:51:13] him right because the son of man
[1:51:15] Revelation was hid until 2000 years
[1:51:18] later
[1:51:19] in this end time
[1:51:22] do you hear what I'm saying do you
[1:51:24] understand amen Peter said Thou Art of
[1:51:26] Christ the son of the Living God he
[1:51:28] didn't say the word for some land he
[1:51:30] didn't say thou regarding human
[1:51:31] Collective men
[1:51:33] prophesied
[1:51:47] the son of man Revelation though was was
[1:51:50] preserved for this time right here
[1:51:53] when Jesus died and resurrected and when
[1:51:56] he ascended he sent back that son of
[1:51:58] God's revelation amen amen because if
[1:52:01] anybody would have ever got the son of
[1:52:03] man Revelation there is the body chain
[1:52:05] my mind there is what you and I are
[1:52:08] living for today that's right amen you
[1:52:11] and I are not here to go by Wesley's
[1:52:14] message or Luther's message or
[1:52:15] Pentecostal message or even even Paul
[1:52:18] Irene is they had their heart right I am
[1:52:22] not and not belittling the Apostle Paul
[1:52:24] right but Paul was a great Revelation he
[1:52:26] had if he would have got the son of man
[1:52:28] Revelation they either took a Rapture in
[1:52:30] the first church
[1:52:32] but God held back amen because he listen
[1:52:36] he can't go over his word because he
[1:52:38] said the son of man was risen again from
[1:52:40] the dead and then he went right straight
[1:52:42] to a lies truly shall come first never
[1:52:44] short all things right yes Elijah the
[1:52:46] ministry the forthcoming obliga had to
[1:52:49] come and restore all things before that
[1:52:51] son of man in Revelation could be made
[1:52:52] on the face of this earth right amen
[1:52:54] right look what we got
[1:52:56] amen sure Son of God of Revelation was
[1:52:59] held the people down through the church
[1:53:01] ages but they died they're in a grave
[1:53:03] they're waiting on us they're waiting on
[1:53:06] somebody to receive a revelation that
[1:53:09] the son of man's not coming
[1:53:15] right brother
[1:53:18] he's him amen
[1:53:20] that's right thank you Lord now the
[1:53:23] physical body of Jesus Christ will not
[1:53:25] come here until the Millennium that's
[1:53:26] right Brothers but
[1:53:29] it's a strong man had to be risen again
[1:53:32] from the dead there's got to be a son
[1:53:34] man of Revelation you and I like this I
[1:53:36] just read that quote to you brother I
[1:53:37] don't say God in human flesh in you
[1:53:39] that's right amen that's right run
[1:53:42] around look in Oneness now buddy if you
[1:53:46] want to read a book one this is good
[1:53:48] book three amen 1962 brother Ryan said
[1:53:50] now don't you see the great picture okay
[1:53:53] we and flesh are different
[1:53:55] we're like a byproduct a creative being
[1:53:58] by holy wedlock but in spirit
[1:54:00] we are Sons and Daughters of God Amen
[1:54:03] not some other spirit
[1:54:06] but the spirit of the Living God we are
[1:54:09] in his likeness in his unity in the
[1:54:13] perfect image of the Living God
[1:54:15] because we become Sons and Daughters not
[1:54:18] separated but the Same Spirit listen
[1:54:20] what about what about God listen listen
[1:54:23] to me just saying what about God here's
[1:54:25] the great God the Eternal God he can
[1:54:26] speak things into existence he can speak
[1:54:28] things out of existence he created
[1:54:29] everything amen
[1:54:31] but yet because of the bar of the word
[1:54:33] he can't be here with his family
[1:54:36] like he wants to be
[1:54:38] right because of what sin this thing's
[1:54:41] exactly right that's the bar or the
[1:54:42] enmity The Amity was a division between
[1:54:44] God and man God had to pull away from
[1:54:47] him because God can't stand right amen
[1:54:49] amen now he looks at your soul every day
[1:54:52] and says that that's my children they're
[1:54:54] Eternal right but we still got to deal
[1:54:56] with this this is what we got to deal
[1:54:57] with right here man amen look not
[1:55:00] separated but the Same Spirit the same
[1:55:02] God the same person joined in wedlock to
[1:55:05] the eternal see how God planned that we
[1:55:08] should be not a different but him not
[1:55:10] some other being of some other tribe but
[1:55:13] a real Union and offspring of the
[1:55:15] almighty amen done by holy Union in
[1:55:19] other words not by the ones of your
[1:55:21] parents but by the Spoken Word season
[1:55:24] right before the foundation of the world
[1:55:26] that we should have come by the spoken
[1:55:28] word of God Amen I believe through Adam
[1:55:30] and Eve it takes two
[1:55:45] three weeks there of management and all
[1:55:48] my ministering there was was uh maturity
[1:55:52] you know right God's not going to come
[1:55:54] back for a baby bride right right so
[1:55:57] he's not coming back for a bunch of baby
[1:55:58] rhymes that's right it's always coming
[1:56:00] back for a while you're a grown woman
[1:56:02] amen somebody who knows what to do with
[1:56:05] the word of God Amen so we're joined in
[1:56:08] wedlock to the Eternal yes see how God
[1:56:11] planted that we should not be different
[1:56:13] but him not some other being or some
[1:56:16] other tribe but a real Union and
[1:56:19] offspring of the almighty yes done by
[1:56:22] holy Union holy yeah the body comes from
[1:56:25] mother and father but the spirit comes
[1:56:27] from God God is separating himself as
[1:56:30] Adam was separated then watch it's a
[1:56:34] continuation paragraph 21.
[1:56:36] on the day of Pentecost we find the Holy
[1:56:38] Spirit the pillar of fire separating
[1:56:40] himself and setting upon each member of
[1:56:42] that church God putting himself together
[1:56:46] what a master builder
[1:56:49] well if he's a master builder and he
[1:56:51] built this we shouldn't be a masterpiece
[1:56:53] family that's right amen amen God
[1:56:56] putting himself together then with that
[1:56:58] group of people together what does it do
[1:57:01] brings back the unified body of the Lord
[1:57:04] Jesus coming together yes and today in
[1:57:08] this great separation that we're living

[2:12:54] and where we don't end our brain we use
[2:12:56] the what the mind of God that's right
[2:12:59] amen and forgetting the word puts you in
[2:13:03] the mind of God that's right
[2:13:05] something else you get in the word of
[2:13:07] God and then what you can do is it's
[2:13:09] like I told him many times before I
[2:13:11] don't know anything about electricity
[2:13:13] and I hate to be shocked awesome so I am
[2:13:17] fearful of even that light socket over
[2:13:20] there I I don't I wouldn't even take the
[2:13:22] cover off that why I'm not skilled in
[2:13:24] what to do with electricity but now a
[2:13:27] master electrician that does it every
[2:13:29] day
[2:13:30] that's nothing to him right he opens
[2:13:32] that up does his work don't even have to
[2:13:34] cut power off right he scare me to death
[2:13:36] why because I'm not trained in what I'm
[2:13:39] doing same way with God God can't use
[2:13:42] you and you're going to be scared to use
[2:13:44] a word of God unless you're trained in
[2:13:47] the word of God right so how you do that
[2:13:49] brother I've said read your Bible and
[2:13:51] practice that's right that's it that's
[2:13:53] real hard and it is yeah it's real hard
[2:13:56] yeah so read your Bible and pray and get
[2:13:59] closer to God that's right stay in the
[2:14:01] message of the hours amen amen when you
[2:14:02] come up to something speak the word of
[2:14:04] God yes speak the word of God Don't Be
[2:14:06] Afraid amen a lot of Heavens don't be
[2:14:09] impressive
[2:14:10] daddy gotta eat something yeah you know
[2:14:13] what he's going to say speak all right
[2:14:18] yes the master builder does not make
[2:14:22] mistakes
[2:14:23] you're not a mistake being here
[2:14:26] so just take that sword of God go
[2:14:29] forward speak the word of God and watch
[2:14:31] God back it up he'll have to the only
[2:14:33] way to get that dead those dead things
[2:14:35] on the ground is for us to be able to
[2:14:37] speak to where God lives and not speak
[2:14:40] it frivolously not speaking on our own
[2:14:42] mind but we are in the mind of God and
[2:14:44] speak what he says then they're going to
[2:14:46] come out of the ground yeah there's
[2:14:48] nothing to hold them back that's right
[2:14:49] the resurrection is the next thing
[2:14:51] that's yeah because we don't get our
[2:14:53] body changed till after the resurrection
[2:14:54] Yeah man so the resurrection that's next
[2:14:57] that's right that's the next thing we're
[2:14:59] looking at is the resurrection of the
[2:15:00] Dead God bless
[2:15:02] amen praise God
[2:15:11] I appreciate that word today amen
[2:15:15] hard not to you know carry it on a
[2:15:18] little bit after all that good work
[2:15:19] amen we appreciate that you heard
[2:15:22] something so mildly important today my
[2:15:24] brothers and sisters I believe we heard
[2:15:26] the express stop to Jehovah and then God
[2:15:28] stops Express amen through the truth
[2:15:30] that he's brought to his children these
[2:15:33] last days Amen brother sisters we can't
[2:15:36] make ourselves into that image but his
[2:15:38] word and his Spirit has the power to
[2:15:40] transform us into that image amen I
[2:15:43] appreciate that ministering today it's
[2:15:46] just like this Bible where the Timothy
[2:15:49] is a mirror
[2:15:50] and sometimes when you go on in around
[2:15:52] your day-to-day life that devil he tries
[2:15:55] to huff and puff all that hot air and
[2:15:57] put that that moisture up on your mirror
[2:16:00] and try to fog it up so when you look
[2:16:02] down at your mirror it don't look too
[2:16:04] good then you can't see your reflection
[2:16:06] in the mirror like you need to let God
[2:16:08] sends somebody like a precious brother
[2:16:10] like brother Wade or a minister brother
[2:16:12] in spite of the spirit to bring that
[2:16:14] word he brings a nice soft cloth and
[2:16:16] wipes that nasty devil humidity off that
[2:16:19] mirror lets you see a little better and
[2:16:22] then I agree I see myself today erase
[2:16:24] God Amen as that Ministry was going
[2:16:26] forth but otherwise I see myself on
[2:16:28] Calvary I see myself in hell I see
[2:16:31] myself in the book right I see myself
[2:16:33] descending Out of Heaven I see my son
[2:16:35] believe that in time testimony of Jesus
[2:16:39] Christ
[2:16:40] and that's what brother Minister do you
[2:16:43] have to see yourself and the Plan of
[2:16:46] Redemption amen amen does anybody any
[2:16:49] specific prayer about anything before we
[2:16:51] go today anything at all that we can
[2:16:54] stand in agreement with you about

[2:21:43] behold how good and how pleasant it is
[2:21:45] for Brethren to dwell together in unity
[2:21:55] I was meditating on the message that
[2:21:58] brother Wade was uh brought to us this
[2:22:00] morning
[2:22:10] if we're brother and if God is our
[2:22:13] father if we're Brethren let's go
[2:22:15] upstairs
[2:22:17] Padre
[2:22:21] it's like you look exactly just like
[2:22:24] your father so you're going to have his
[2:22:26] same characteristics you're going to
[2:22:27] have it the same way he acts
[2:22:33] as in the physical father if you're
[2:22:35] child of your father you're gonna have
[2:22:37] to act the same way as your heavenly
[2:22:39] father
[2:22:56] because if we're still in the world
[2:22:59] following the traditions of the world
[2:23:01] acting like the world
[2:23:04] then we're not his child children
[2:23:07] we don't look like him
[2:23:10] if you're his child
[2:23:12] you're gonna look like him me amen
