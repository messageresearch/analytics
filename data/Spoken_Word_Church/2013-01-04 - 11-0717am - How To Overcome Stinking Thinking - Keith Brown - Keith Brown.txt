we just we're going to try to sing this song Amen let's try try to keepy him yeah how many thankful for the lighthouse amen amen there's a lighthouse on the hillside that over looks like see when I'm TOS it sends out of light yes light I might see and the light that shines in darkness now will safely the home right if it wasn't for that Lighthouse tell me where would this ship be now everybody around the lighthouse they said why don't you just tear it on down well the big ships they don't sell this way anymore there's no you that old thing standing around but then my mind goes back to that stormy night when just in time I saw the light and the light from that Old lious still stands on calary here and I thank God for the lighthouse I ow my life to him Jesus is is the lighthouse and safe from the rocks of sin he has shown his light about me oh that I might clearly see if it wasn't for that Old Lighthouse tell me where would this ship be if you know what sing it with me and I God all I have I oh my life to him Jesus is the LI house and save from the rocks of sin he has shown his light about me all that I might could see if it wasn't for more than a lious tell me where would this ship be tell me where would this should be hallelujah praise the Lord amen and I tell you I know where this ship would be we'd been crashed up against the Rocks that's right okay without that light we don't have anything to lead the way amen so we want to get into the word of God here this morning and uh we have a little thought we'd like to share with you uh it's a little uh series that I had ministered at my church here not long ago and um I believe um that the Lord laid this back on my heart to speak here amen um and I pray this will be a blessing to you but we want to turn our bibles if you would over to uh Ephesians Ephesians uh chapter uh 2 and verse one and also if you would turn your Bibles our main uh scripture text will be St John 11 and we would begin reading uh in um verse um I'd say uh 21 or 22 but we want to just take a little thought here uh this this morning and and possibly if the Lord would lead us if we go into that direction we just want to be led of the Holy Spirit whatever he would have us to say but we want to just share a little thought about the resurrection of Lazarus and uh I'd like for you to see some things in here about the resurrection of Lazarus and I believe that you begin to see what it is that Lazarus went through and went what he went down with yeah what he came up with yeah and what he overcome amen I believe you'll see a lot of yourself in there amen so we want to begin reading in in Ephesians and this a well-known scripture and I believe that this it begins it says and you have he quickened who were dead in trespasses and in sins right wherein in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience but aren't you thankful it doesn't work in you anymore amen among whom also we all had our conversations in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others ain't that powerful but God who is rich in Mercy amen for his love great love wherewith he loved us I like I I that just touches my heart when I hear him say he loved me amen amen even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by Grace ye are saved and hath raised us up together and made us set together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now if you notice that that's from one condition to another condition exactly amen hallelujah praise God now let's take our bibles if you would let's just turn right over here to St John and uh we won't read a just a lot the scripture is just the whole scripture is just full of wonderful nuggets amen but let's just begin reading where it says in verse uh 21 then Martha said unto Jesus Lord if thou had been here my brother had not died but I know that even now whatever thou will ask of God God will give it to thee amen Jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again Martha said unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life and he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou this amen she said unto him yay Lord I believe that thou art the Christ the son which shall come into the world now let's just flip over here to 43 if we would and when he thus had spoken he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth and he that was dead came forth bounded hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was bound about with a napkin Jesus said unto them loose him amen and let him go amen let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we come to you this morning Lord and we ask you Lord that you would speak through your servant Lord and the words that you have laid upon his heart father we would ask you in Jesus name God that you would come down now Lord Jesus move your servant out of the way Lord bless the ears of the hears that have come Lord I know they're looking to hear something father and we ask you God that you would just speak to us in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you Saints you may be seated amen I'm going take my coat off here bless so if I preach too long just pull on my cooktail God bless everybody we want to take our thought here this morning out of Ephesians 2 And1 and it says you who he ha quickened right now we see the word uh Quicken and it means to be made alive right amen because we know one thing we know that we are the chosen of God that's right and we were chosen of him the Bible says in Ephesians I believe it says that he chose us in love go amen he chose us in love Glory Church he didn't fall in love with us he always loved us see his love is greater than affiliate love amen but his love is so great that he loved you yeah when you was dead to him right right he loved you when you was a sinner he loved you when you was a drunker he loved you in that condition and he took you the way you were he didn't let you get cleaned up and then accept you amen but he saw you before the foundation of the world so what do we got to worry about right God is in control of every condition every situation that we go through we have to understand that praise be to God and we want to see um our scripture here and the thought that we want to bring out here is that we see a a Woman by the name of Martha right and we know that there's Martha there's Mary there's Lazarus and Lazarus we find out that he died right and we also find out that Jesus could not uh be around until he died right see sometimes things have got to get bad I hear a lot of people say well my marriage is just the worst it is well sometimes the worst has come before the better right hello I said sometimes the worst has to come before the better because that's the way it does Amen it that's not always better and then it's worse so sometimes the worse sometimes the cancer is worse before it gets better amen so don't always think when something gets worse that God can't handle it God can take every situation and I want to show you something here this morning just for a little season of time that we're going to speak this morning and perhaps as we carry it on this evening but what we want to talk about here is just a line of thought because what we want to see here is that Jesus had to leave and when he left the people there were waiting on him Mary and Martha had sent a word for Jesus come your your your friend the one that you love the one that loves you come and heal him do something but see Jesus couldn't do it right right right because he had seen a vision of a resurrection hallelujah amen Lazarus had gone down with something my brother and sister and that was potentials yeah right he went down into the grave with potentials yeah and I'm going to tell you if you don't have these potentials that Lazarus had if you don't have have these potentials that God is looking for then you're you're not going to resurrect you're not going to come forth exactly that's right because this is our line of thinking is coming forth overcoming all the things that are in your life right things that are of your past that are still trying to haunt you you know there's some people that are sitting in the message now that are still Bound in their mind cuz they don't TR God and release it to him what we try to do sometimes my brother and sister is we will give him our strengths oh yeah we'll give him our power we'll give him our our gifts we'll give him all these things but we won't give him our weaknesses right come on brother amen and that's what we need to do is take those weaknesses and give them the hearing because he can turn that situation around you see the only thing that could have right in this situation was a resurrection that's why I said sometimes things in your life have got to get bad but you have to still have the same faith and trust God Amen even if it gets worse even if the doctor looks at you and says well we there's no hope y see you got to realize one thing the doctor only knows what his book says he can only go by what his book says amen but we got a greater book my brother and sister and the great physician tells us that he can change the condition and I'm here to tell you this morning I don't care what kind of condition you're in I don't care what struggle you got right now I believe there's an hour when it's time for you to come forth and when that hour comes in your life there's no devil in hell going to stop you from coming forth hallelujah amen death couldn't stop it corruption couldn't stop it right praise God so here we are we see ourselves as the message tells us that God saw us not just saw us yeah but he chose us right right so his choice God's choice has to be a sovereign choice right so his choice has to be based on something Sovereign he has to have that sovereign so as we go back into the mind of God we find out that he was the lamb slain yeah before the foundation of the world right that's right so when God saw you and he chose you and he didn't just fall in love with you yeah exactly that's right he always loved you amen yes sir because you are a part of him and what you need to understand my brother and sister is the hour when you come forth to recognize what he's already done for you that the work is already over it's already done the price has already been paid and he's now saying to you come forth right amen right brother Hallelujah to God right but you know there's always those around and people have a problem with something yeah sure you know what that's called it's called stinking thinking abely Amen to that stinking thinking that's right amen because they cannot see you the way God sees you right right they cannot understand what it is that God has already done for youen Martha had come to a place she knew he was the Christ right but she needed more of a revelation and church sometimes he'll take the closest thing from you exactly to bring you to the place he'll take things from you just to Humble you and get you to the place where he wants to be able to work with you amen exactly I tell you as we look into this scripture we're going to see so many different little nuggets that just jump out and if we begin to look and we begin to see this scripture I want to read something to you that the prophet of God said go ahead and this is in the message um it's the rising of the sun it says now see now you're already resurrected amen when God raised him up he raised you up the sun is just there on you and now you are growing into the blossom life like like he was to be resurrected in the last day so my brother and sister you are growing to a full Resurrection but the work has already begun yes sir but our problem is we have those around with stinking thinking and sometimes we find if we're not careful that we might have stinky thinking right because we cannot Look What God Says we are right amen we struggle with the fact of what God says we are amen and the reason we do is because it takes a revelation it takes an understanding and brothers and sisters Lazarus came forth with something yeah he came forth the prophet of God says now watch the father told him one day Lazarus is going to die I want you to go away it's going to be so many days Jesus would without warning or anything obeyed the father and went away they sent him said Lazarus sick come pray for him Jesus just went on they sent him away and he just kept going yeah finally after the time was fulfilled that the father had showed him right oh I'll tell you when Lazarus came forth he didn't just come forth in a resurrection saints of God but he came forth with an understanding and what that understanding was is what the father had seen of him yeah Hallelujah Church you ain't just a church member here you're not just a church member come on brother exactly it should be more than that it should be deeper than that amen you should be looking in your life and say Lord where can I come forth Lord where is these things in my life that I've got to die out to where are these dead things that are trying to uh uh take me down right let me share something with you dead things can't hold you right that's right I've been to many funeral homes I never had a dead man reach out and grab me if I wanted to hold on to something dead I had to grab a hold of it that's right CU there's no life right right in that body that's right Hallelujah to God you think about that now you say well then I think I start to understand where my struggle is I'm not letting go of the Dead things right they're trying to that are trying to hold me trying to bind me trying to hold me down right see church you've got to be willing to let it go that's right because if you don't it won't let go of you right amen see you have to come to the place to where you say as Jesus told Lazarus he said Lazarus come forth so here it is say he wasn't just calling to a man to a resurrection but he was calling this man to something right he was calling him to an understanding he was calling him to a revelation right of what he went down let me tell you something when he came forth he recognized that what he believed is the truth right amen ain't it wonderful when you go through a trial when you go through a testing and you go through something and you find out you say Lord your word is real your word is the truth no other word could have done this no other Church no other man nor the Lord only you can do this amen but now watch this speaking of this Resurrection so he said that you now have the Potentials in you right now and the potentials that Lazarus went down with he said I am the resurrection and life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live so brothers and sisters the voice that was calling out was not just a voice right that's right amen but it is the voice that summons all things amen that's right oh I tell you is that voice speaking to you that's right amen if you're sitting in this assembly tonight you've already been in contact with the voice of the Resurrection Hallelujah that voice is already called out amen that voice has already brought you out of the Dead things it's already changed you from form to another form the prophet said from a sinner to a saint that's right so you no longer think on those things right exactly you know there are people in this world that are called niccs do you know what a nicc is I do that is a person that will hold on to dead things yeah that is a person that cannot release that which has died right that is a person that excuse my expression as you study into it you'll find out that it is a romance with the dead yeah they cannot release their dead mother their dead father they cannot release these things right and they hold on to them they dig them up out of the Grave yeah right right and they won't let go of what is already dead if God says it's dead then it's wreck and dead am exactly amen are you with me here Saints so we want to see here that if God says it's dead if God says it's done away with then why are people still struggling right Amen in that area of their life right I'm not exactly because you don't really believe what God has said right right right brother exactly amen hallelujah oh my praise God that's what these nihils are y they're attracted to dead things yeah the prophet of God said this world is should be dead to us right amen the things of this world should be dead to us but try telling that to a nicic yeah and I wonder in the message if we got some spiritual nicil right people that just refuse to let go of the Dead things right brother come on I'm here to tell you this morning Lazarus was in a tomb Lazarus was sealed up right Lazarus was in a condition where everybody was stinking thinking right but I want to share something with you this morning I want to show you how to overcome stinking thinking because there is a way sure Lord that you can overcome stinking thinking there is a way that you can look and see what God says and believe what God says amen hallelujah to God so we want to look at this now that when Lazarus Rose listen listen to this that Jesus spoke to uh mark and said thy brother shall rise again right A lot of people think they know everything you know yeah amen a lot of people think they understand this about the resurrection that about this and this about this let me tell you something Jesus was trying to bring her to a deeper understanding of who he was Martha I'm not just the Christ come on but what you're about to witness amen is the resurrection amen he said I am the resurrection and the life so we see church that the resurrection isn't just an event but it is a person and if that person is in you Hallelujah that Resurrection is in you Hallelujah and the word is calling you amen that's right what called Lazarus right sir it was the revealed word of the hour it was the manifested word for that day that was calling a man in a condition that he was in is this okay SS of God hallelujah to God Amen but see you are part of a vision right sure amen God saw you amen before the foundation of the world and when he saw you and he chose you his choice couldn't be based on yeah he's okay no he's not yeah this is not yeah I'll take this I don't like that blackhaired guy this r no I'll take it yeah no no that wasn't God exactly God's choice was Sovereign amen because it was based on the same thing that looses you today the shed blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah his choice was Sovereign because it was based on blood Glory even in the mind of God are you with me here say some see I'm trying to show you how to overcome stinking thinking right I'm trying to show you how to release these dead things so you can be free so that you can live again so the lifeless areas in your life can now be resurrected you say my marriage is falling apart well he can make it come forth again amen you say my home is erect he can make it come forth again Hallelujah to God oh I feel his presence here this morning listen to what the prophet of God says I like reading what the prophet says I love looking at a scripture and then seeing what he said about the scripture because you're seeing through the eye of a prophet exactly now watch this watch what he says he says um uh in the Lamb's Book of Life whose names uh in the Lamb's Book of Life from the foundation of the world that's Abraham's seed this is in Abraham's Grace Covenant if you want to write it down he says God's choosing right not yours right well don't you just love Brothers with limited Grace yeah yeah you know Lord if this man does this to me should I forgive him seven times Well I tell you I'm glad God ain't a man with with just limited Grace right that's right brother all right buddy this is the fifth time Seven's my limit yeah right but Jesus said no 70 times s you say but brother Kei he's done come up to me 15 times and ask for forgiveness good because maybe it's helping you am right amen most of us are I told you I forgive you now get out of here you're bothering me leave me alone yeah right amen I told you I forgive you but maybe that's what the brother needs right right maybe he needs a little bit more right and maybe what it is is God's having him to come up until one day you forgive him and it's not you anymore forg but it's the resurrection in you forgiving him it's the Christ in you that's forgiving him remember Jesus said this he said father forgive them for they know not what they do right now did you notice he didn't say I forgive you yeah right but what Christ did is he allowed the father he allowed that eternal spirit to forgive the world through him right absolutely exactly are you with me sir goe see sometimes it takes a lot of God to forgive somebody right exactly right that's right brother oh come on now don't get quiet come on Amen I live in the same town called realville okay I'm down here I tell you you're looking at the only man that can get lost in Lula you get lost in Lula now there's something you got a problem here now I had a gentleman one time I I was trying to find a way to a church and he said uh I I said where is this certain place at he said oh yeah yeah that's right he said you just you go down the road and you go over the bridge right well in Florida our bridges are 2 mi long right I went over this boat and I drove for about 10 miles almost I realized I said something a't right here so I come back over the bump and I realized that was the bridge oh Hallelujah but the hour has come for you to come forth amen that's right right exactly amen no excuses right that's it amen amen bro it's time to wake up right exactly it's time to look at your life amen and say God are you really there yes yes Amen brother that if I need you in the time of death yes y that if I need you in a time will you be there for me amen see the hour has come right we're living in a day now where we're fixing to take a a trip on the good old gospel sh and the time is for you to hear what the word is telling you to do Lazarus was in a condition 4 days talk about a stinking thinking right Amen brother brother Rah said his nose had fell off y the maggots was all in him right his his his his nose was slick y the corruption was all in him right he said he was on a 4 day Journey y think at that but you know what that shows me that that voice that summons all things it don't matter what kind of condition you sitting in this church right now right brother he can bring you forth true Hallelujah help us Lord this morning see Jesus said I go to wake him he didn't say I'm going to try I see how it works no if it looks a little too hard I think I'll just leave church that's the way it is with a lot of people when things start to get hard you know and things really uh you say well I'm serving the lord I'm doing this I'm doing that and it just seems like these things are coming down on me and I look around and I got people around me and they're just just a bunch of agitators in my life I say praise God for the agitator right amen every washing machine has to have an agitator that's how you get the wash clean oh our church would be so good if we didn't have these agitators in our church chug chug chug chug maybe the dirt needs to get cleaned out maybe you need to find a place see that's what's happening see God brings those things into the church cuz it's not just for to help but it's to help you right right so you may find out that you got something dead in you that you ain't died out am see you may find out there's some part in your life that oh my God had to bring this man into the church yeah had to bring this sister oh Lord you just had to bring this sister everything was fine until this family come into the church oh lord well I just don't understand it it's not for you to understand sometimes God will bring into a church a situation to find out the maturity of the churches brother amen that's right and sometimes the pastor will know what's going on and why won't that brother why won't he do this why won't he take care of this why won't he straighten this out because he's waiting to see what the spirit is going to do to the yeah right sure come on church if the pastor attacked every single thing that come into the church You' have the most paranoid Church in the world exactly somebody walk in the church yeah right I got my eye on you buddy but see those Brothers with limited Grace they can all go so far right yeah but if the Life of Christ is in you and it's living in you you can Overlook if you're the statute of the perfect man right right and you've come to brotherly kindness brother brandom says brotherly kindness putting yourself in his place that's right in the matter right you'd be surprised how easy there'd be a lot of things that overcome and the struggles that you'd have if you could just put yourself in that other person's place right and you could just see it through their eyes you might find out that it's your fault right right amen right right see but we're talking about a Resurrection right and we're talking about a man who was in a condition and in that condition I mean it looked hopeless abely I mean Martha she was brother brandom said she had the right to abraid Jesus yeah but she didn't do it right but even in her own thinking yep she was say he stinketh yeah you want me to roll the the stone back yeah right well Martha didn't you say even now yeah even now Lord right if you had been here my brother would not have died but even now Lord help us Lord right see because if we're not careful our mind will lean in a direction because we have to have a revelation to understand what God is doing in our lives right amen see once you get a revelation then the rest is rest right amen exactly see once you begin to see what God is doing and leave it alone right brother come on and don't try try to poke at it right don't try to stir it but let God deal with the situation right amen because when you do that then you're beginning to overcome that way of stinky thinking yeah right because you don't you have to see it the way God sees it Glory that's right are you wouldn't here this morning praise God Amen so let's watch this here now because before the foundation of the world he saw you yeah and he chose you and the blood that was shed for you he chose you by Grace oh Hallelujah church that means something to me no wonder able when he offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice yeah than that of Cain because what Abel offered to God is what God had give to Abel right and now in worship he is now giving that back to God and God received his sacrifice why church because it match the Eternal sacrifice amen that's right exactly and see that's what our life has to do our life has to match what the word says our life has to come in order right and God is calling you each one of us to come forth come out of that situation right that you're in amen amen the voice that is calling you today that voice is the voice brother brother brand said that quickened you amen that is the same voice that had you to be baptized in Acts 238 amen that same voice that spoke to John that said come up hither it's the same voice it ain't a different voice saints of God if God is speaking to you today then the voice of the Resurrection has already spoke in your heart Hallelujah to God you are already now resurrect in Christ Jesus am help us Lord oh praise God he's already called you from one condition right right to another amen condition amen see you're not in that same condition right amen because if you are y right brother y some's day right something's stinking yeah but you can overcome amen that's right you know how come cuz he said you can he saw you overcome he saw the vision of you overcoming that trial that you're in right now that testing that you're in right now he's holding your position right man right glory to God Amen when the lamb slain 2,000 years ago on Calvary not in God's sight right he was the lamb slain from the foundation of the world when God saw what Satan had done his program was laid out and he knowed that he would send his son and he would be a perpetuation for our sin right right amen that means he took our place right Glory that's hallelujah amen you mean to tell me when you was in the condition that you were in he loved you I know exactly yep that's right he didn't clean you all up and he said I love that guy he's just going to be a great guy no but he saw you glory am before the foundation of the world holy and Without Blame amen that's the vision he saw of you that's why I say to you Church of Lula it's the hour to come forth the word of this hour the voice of the Resurrection is speaking in your heart that same voice that has quickened you is now telling you to come for Glory to God Amen I mean he was a man in a tomb for 4 days right I mean you talk about something stinking yeah you talk about people looking at that and seeing them man walk up and roll the stone back brother Brandon said why did he ask them to roll the stone right right he said he should have been a gentleman yeah but he said it shows you there's something you see don't put it all on him something you have to do something that you I'll tell you if you want the lifeless areas that you're dealing with with right now and I don't know what that can be but I'm here to tell you this morning that voice can speak right now into the lifeless area and breath new life into that situation right hallelujah praise God sorry brother he saw you amen he chose you before the foundation of the world I'm trying to labor this cuz I'm trying to get you to see that there's nothing that you can overcome all things right right but you got to stop having the stinking think that's right amen you got to stop thinking like the devil wants you to think you got to stop reacting the way the devil wants you to react and you got to start reacting the way God's word says you should react Lord give me p and I want it right now you be careful right tribulation work of patience that's right and you might be sitting right new to the tribulation yeah you might be that's you don't know but tribulation worketh patience that's correct brother Brown said Moses is poor they had some hot nights out there in that desert but saw tempers yep right s because when you come to that place you come to find out you turn around and look at your mate and say you're part of my perfection yeah yeah what are off quiet maybe maybe I to go back to uh yeah is that amazing you get married before you get married have you no when you know you know with God he didn't fall in love with us he always loved us but we fall in love with our mate right is that right God saw before the foundation of the world who we would have God saw he put this person in our life and we had to come down the pathway of life and go through the trials and heartaches and testing see that's why young people you need to be careful of the Dead things you're attracted to right brother yes sir that's right that's right oh Samson was a Son of God right sure he was an anointed Son of God right okay but let me tell you something when that little philistine got a hold of him Y and I always tell the young people in my church the
