David Come and sing for us God bless you buddy God bless you all just so good to see everybody uh greetings from the church in Sweetwater we're we're killing lots of Philistines out our way and we're pressing the battle and the church is doing well I was just amazed when I come here I watched a lot of these young ones grow up and I I see some faces not here anymore but to see The Young Ones taking up their swords and shields for the Lord got so much to say just take a couple minutes all right you know we went through this covet thing and I I wanted to say a couple things about kovid for the world it may be one way but for us the kovid was nothing but a door to heaven for some of our precious brothers and sisters we did not lose anybody they went to the next place amen and we'll wait on them we didn't lose anybody everything that happens to the believer was predestinated for ordained planned of God and if that was God's choice to to have Isaiah the prophet son and have to have John the Baptist beheaded and to have Brother Ray Montgomery go by a crazy virus so be it that's God Amen and we'll see them again Amen in this message it goes on and just uh every now and then we have a little Eagle that comes with his family brother Ryan God bless you so good to have him my heart is different from two years ago when we saw each other and I just can't help but think about Abraham traveling and he's he's gone through Wilderness to some places he's never seen and he's thinking this world is not my home and he's just looking for a place you know and he knows God is the maker of that promised place and he's searching and searching and he meets people and they're just such strangers with such strange ways and that's right oh my but you know God was God was good to him and he gave him the he gave him the answer to all his questions and this message has given us the answer to all of our questions amen we are we are coming to a place exactly where we're supposed to be at exactly the right moment and we'll get to what I told my 14 year old daughter I says honey you get to watch the world fall apart you get to watch as the world is falling apart the things that were said back in the prophets Ministry are coming to pass right before us what an amazing thing yeah you know you get a chance to think while you're driving three hours a little bit more because of the rain and a couple curves you know all of a sudden we got to a place we hadn't been there for a long time and it's called Blood Mountain and I thought how perfect I'm on blood Mountain I'm on the I'm on the road Through Blood Mountain and all those curves and those hardships and I thought this is the perfect place for me I want to be on blood Mountain amen I want to be on that road where the blood of Jesus Christ covers every step that I take amen I want to be on that road where the king of Calvary is trod and I'm thinking going down and finally you know it's just 18 miles and I'm just driving and driving it says 17. it's like yep that's it and those curves were so so steep you almost turned back and go the other way I think that's Blood Mountain yeah I'm still going forward though I'm still pressing on I'm still still making it we're still making it this message is so worldwide I I think sometimes unfortunately as Americans we don't get to see the power that's happening all over the world right but I can testify to you today in Chilean in Argentina in in Haiti in Cambodia of all places you walk and there's churches amen what a lovely thing and I can't say Amen what a lovely thing and I can't wait to hear the word and I pray it's real good we come for church amen we come to to let the enemy know where we stand you're part of an invincible Army this is the day now where we're beginning to recognize who we are amen and there is no uh lack of water there is no drought Amen in this Kingdom so I love everybody and thank you for staying with this message thank you for gathering together my heart just just feels so at home and it's been too long too long for us to be apart and and uh I just want to quit wandering one day one day we're going to run brother Samuel right we're going to run like children see who is filing faster amen we're gonna sing we're gonna hear our brother sing again amen and then maybe David will come along Dave says I'll play the harp to that song and yeah and now that won't that be grand amen amen God bless you and looking forward to the word and hey let's just really pull from the minister let's just have one of them great old Services because yes last thing to say we don't know how long this will last oh I'm not worried I have social security to live by oh yeah like that that can take it oh I'm better off yet I've got the stock market I've messed around with that a little bit and I I've used a yo-yo in my life and it goes up goes down and I'm so happy and I'm so sad but the word of God will be true the word of God will go past all that and we are on the right track we are going through Blood Mountain amen we're going to come out on the other side of them clouds isn't that wonderful God bless you so good this evening thank you I remember when we were the same size who praise the Lord [Music] I'm just a poor ing strangers [Applause] there is no sickness to which I go I'm going there to see my father and all my love [Music] the goals I know dark clouds arise before me I know my way is dark and sea but beautiful [Music] arise [Applause] their vigils keep I'm going there to see my brother he said he'd meet [Music] thank you I'm only going over Jordan I'm only going over [Music] here I hope brother Nick Addison heard that that one brother Dick's favorites one of his favorite songs he liked to sing and I hope that the Lord let him open back the curtain just for a minute brother Tom just kind of peek over and see somebody a young man pick up a guitar and remind him when he was here but he's young man over there hey man so he remember he's I hope he just said let him bro David that was touched our heart so that brother dick Addison Our Song leader of this past Stone he used to just really enjoy seeing it song and I think he whipped him on the guitar but it's our Builder date night we'll talk about that later but um it's good to see these young young ones grow up brother Tommy he's talking about brother Ryan he's a deacon now at the church and teaches Sunday school he's been doing that for a little while but when he first came along he was just a little kid you know remember we used to come to he'd ride with us in in the van and and he'd have to sit in the front because he got sick going through those curves and and then he he overcame that you know what he could have done what like a lot of us would have done we're not going because we're going to get sick no he persevered he went right on I mean we met we may have to carry a couple barf bags with us but we made it Ryan made it he made it through all that now he's going up here by himself how about that so but that's the way the Lord works and it brings it brings a joy to me to see that in in each one of life and brother Tom you know as well as I do we've seen your kids grow from just from chill or from nothing from nothing so there you are and then now you're now you're grown and nice looking bunch of kids and they're not kids but young adults now and uh and all these that are you see sitting here there's a lot of them 10 years ago a little little babies that wasn't able now we've got other sisters brother this is this is Brother Ryan's kids here so we got a group coming up God always will have a group if if it's if it's of God he'll always have a group waiting to come forward as the other one maybe uh goes off the scene and we're able to sit back and and watch the young people and we sure appreciate them so let's stand to our feet um remember uh sister Raymond she's about a month from having that baby and she's having some back issues I thought I'd go outside and brother Daniel and her have really traveled a while to get here too and her being pregnant and it was a wonderful day a couple years ago when we baptized her here at the church and I didn't know if I was going to get her out of the water she had that big head thing on her head and I didn't know how in the world that thing got sold was in trouble but she wanted to be baptized so we baptized her anybody ever want to be baptized will baptize them so uh but good to see each and every one of you here now let's go listen to the word of the Lord Brother Chris Long from Flagstaff Arizona where it snows constantly it's probably snowing out there now but but send us a picture one time a couple years ago and you you could see the stop sign brother Tom that's all you could see the rest will snow from there down then he sent us a picture a few months ago of his well it was a hump for a car he had to hunt for his car to dig that thing out so uh it was good that we have this here I'm okay right where I'm at well I'm good I'm good love brother Chris but I love him from afar over that way and then we'll come back and forth and see each other and whip but we appreciate him loving with the love of the Lord he said he never met brother Tom so he's getting being able to meet him he's a brother Chris is a good brother he's solid as a rock and we enjoy his ministry here and we appreciate him loving with the love of the Lord so let's sing Open the Eyes of My Heart as he comes to minister for us just take his Liberty now afterwards we're going to have a meal prepared for you so just stay and hang around Fellowship tomorrow's service start at 9 45 with regular Sunday school class and then it'll just be one service tomorrow and then we can Fellowship afterwards so last thing opened the Eyes of My Heart as our brother comes Open the Eyes of My Heart alone Open the Eyes of My Heart how many come to see him today we come to see him not him we come to see him the one that died for our sins Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you and I want to see [Music] As we sing Holy Holy Holy amen high and lift it up amen Lord pour out your power and love as we sing Holy Holy Holy [Music] foreign [Music] amen I like that cause I'm looking at him right now in the form of the mystical body of Jesus Christ pleasure to be here with you tonight God bless you all what appropriate words that brother Tom spoke you didn't realize that the title of my message is Resurrection by representation amen but unfortunately we're going to have to hit a little dark sock before we get to the light I think that's why the weather's so bad outside because this represents the day when he was entombed backed many thousand years ago and uh really enjoyed brother Dutch's message I tell you what that fed my soul uh that was Eagle food enjoyed it enjoyed it enjoyed it he just texted me a minute ago said he was still driving I told him I went down to the rental car agency and traded in my car for a boat we may get snow but at least we can walk on it amen sure love everybody here it's a pleasure to be here with you I don't need to take up a lot of time introducing myself how about if we just get right into the word and and I'll try to keep her under three hours and that'll you'll be plenty hungry Lenny hungry my wife's already saying uh all right let's go to Romans 8 11. I'm gonna yeah cut the lights right uh Romans 8 11. Resurrection by representation now I got to give you the dark side first but I'm reading this scripture because it's the end result of the Rising of the sun amen I got a pair of glasses in here somewhere no I don't need a pair thank you he loaned me a pair last time and there were some girls glasses and I I just don't go there if you got your Bibles open I tell you Brothers back there in the back I found an app that makes the sound of pages turning there is one there sure is I like to hear the pages of your Bible turning but there is an app that makes that sound so you guys might want to hook it up all right Romans 8 verse 11 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you all right let's bow our heads father we thank you this evening Lord or this afternoon father for the grand privilege of being able to gather together Lord with those of like Faith father unto the shed blood and banner of Jesus Christ Lord we realize that the weather outside father is compensation Lord for what happened Lord 2 000 years ago or so father we realize Lord that while it was dark and gloomy outside Lord you were still working as we desire to work for you today Lord amen bless each and every one that's made the effort to come Lord thank you for traveling Mercy's father in the specials Lord and the and the tender words from Brother Tom Lord help me father I pray to get out of the way Lord use me for your honor and your glory Lord and let he that hath an ear hear what the spirit saith unto the churches Lord for your honor and For Your Glory in the precious and lovely name of Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you may be seated God is good all the time not just some of the time all the time I like what brother Wade said the son is still shining up there yes it is amen amen now it says here in Ephesians uh chapter 1 verse 4 according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love now we realize that this is the real the real and only genuine holiday holy day which we can put our actual pulse upon celebrate sometimes Christmas some people do but we know that Christ wasn't born on December the 25th probably born sometime in April maybe late March early may like Lambs are born depending on the weather conditions but this weekend is the one time that we know as Christians that set aside properly and of course it started uh I guess a week or so ago from tomorrow it's a Palm Sunday when he came into town we heard brother Dutch cover that marvelously I tell you what I got I I got some good notes do you mind if I if I if I just go over a couple of things and again I I enjoyed every word of it amen he was preaching to me if he wasn't preaching to you right and I like when he started out when as soon as he said the word Einstein now I'm not a genius I'm not a mathematical guy like that I'm not a scientist but when the prophet of God says something about somebody it always intrigues me and I like to kind of look into that area uh brother Branham even went so far as to say that he went to hear a talk on Einstein that was given by a fellow that was famous back then I know his name but it doesn't come to me it doesn't matter uh but you know he said that Einstein was looking for the center he was looking for the center of the universe and and he was trying to find it by mathematics and uh of course he was a pretty good mathematical guy and I and I know that I wrote this down if I got it right uh uh brother uh Dutch mentioned that um how that Einstein and and and mathematicians and scientists afterwards and so forth um believed believed today that you can travel forward in time okay uh and they and they and they formulate that by uh their their mathematical formulas and he mentioned how that Einstein had had uh made a proof of something and then couldn't find that last little phrase that he needed in that long five or six chalkboards worth of of algebraic equations any and he used the word he fudged he fudged it you know he he he he thought well if I put this number in here nobody will know I think that's what Satan thought by trying to inject the seed into Adam's race I'll put this in here and nobody will recognize it well right away of course somebody that has life and not death somebody eating off the tree of life and not the knowledge of the tree of Good and Evil would immediately recognize wait a minute you fudged it there because we we don't go for that no we want all the work we don't want just part of the word we don't want 99 0.9999 of the word we want all the word now did you realize brothers and sisters that that has been the desire of all of the past Christians Believers men of God and so forth all the way back to the beginning right but God ordained a Time in history where only one portion of his body would be able to come to that fullness of his word and we live in that time it amazes me how that you or I can read a scripture uh hear a message here a sermon preached from a minister and and and you you could have heard that same sermon five minutes five days five years 50 years ago but spiritual food new season it's always in action it's a never-ending occurrence so when he said that they'd proven that that they they believe now now now I don't know that any one of these scientists have ever went forward in time but they believe mathematically it can be accomplished is that right now he also said that these same scientists uh do not believe that you can go back in time all right or erase your past we got news for them but I'm going to tell you folks something that science at the end of its uh equations and and calculations and and postulations and theories proves God so I'm gonna help them right now I'm going to agree with him brother Wade I don't have to go back in time okay but wait a minute I'm going to preach to you Resurrection by representation oh brother Branham told us that the woman at the well as an example uh as she had representation now she didn't know that [Laughter] but she had it anyway and he said the Sadducees and the Pharisees and the high priest and the priesthood and and the Sanhedrin and all them they didn't have that representation So based upon that they attacked the word of God Amen in the flesh they didn't attack the word of God and the Scrolls they believed that they had the revelation of what was in those Scrolls but they didn't realize that the word had been made flesh and that is why they crucified him we don't crucify you for being a good man now but we crucify you for you being a man and making yourself God man you know what it would have been fantastic if Jesus knew that they had representation and he would have said but doesn't it say in Genesis let us make man in our image and after our likeness but they couldn't have swallowed that so he didn't cast his pearls he said I got to turn aside there's somebody waiting for me at a well that's right and I happen to know that I am her representation and I'm gonna resurrect a life that's been laying in her since before the foundation of the world now I'm preaching to you on Resurrection we can go back and we can go through the history uh was it uh was it brother Dutch that mentioned in your and and brother Samuel is I been an eyewitness that for instance over in the Philippines this weekend there it's probably tomorrow morning over there now they are really literally nailing themselves to crosses they've carried them and and so forth and all those things uh and and but but but they're not going to resurrect from the dead and last they were in him yeah before the foundation of the world so my thoughts that I wrote down while brother Dutch was speaking was that we don't have to go backwards God always moves forward what the prophet of God taught us that eternal life is like a circle so if you just keep going far enough you'll go past your past and you'll come right back up to where you came from we don't have to go back we need to go forward is that right yeah that just got inspired when he said that I said oh I see something here you see because what we think of discernment by the prophet is him looking back because we're creatures of time what we don't realize is that the god that we serve never goes backwards those four living creatures always go forward I'm gonna get brother Wade a hat foreign bills on it Postman beekeeper mayor he only wants three bills right now I'll stop right there was the fourth one waiting there's a fourth one waiting I know you do because I'm on your side God is good amen but look where we're at today man I enjoyed that I'll tell you what Mr Goodwin if you missed it I mean you know we understand it people have to do things and it looked like uh he is preaching on Good Friday but it looked like a bad Friday really did um but it was a good Friday the weather outside right now looks terrible but there will be a sunrise I believe tomorrow we'll see it but I want to put some emphasis on a few things if I can I'm not going to keep you a long time I hear your stomach's growling now I remember uh in one of the messages and it'll come to me brother Branham is that a Full Gospel business Moroccan systems at a Full Gospel businessman's breakfast and he keeps telling the people at the end of the message forget about the cafeteria now he does yeah he says you go back and listen and he picks it up two or three or four times don't worry about it it'll still be there when you because he was bearing down on something yeah but let me read let me start out by reading something to you out of a message if I could uh the brothers I'll tell you what they are you know I'm just a rookie with these tablet things you all know that uh and uh perhaps someday I'll actually get used to them The God Who is rich in Mercy 119-65. let's just you want to go for a ride right now it's a boat but let's go for a ride okay brother Brandon says starting in paragraph 30. and I was speaking last Sunday on the Ephesians how that the Book of Joshua was the Ephesians of the Old Testament and how was the book of redemption you see that's what Easter's all about and Redemption has two different parts don't forget that now come out of and entering into first you have to come out some people wants to bring the world in with him but you got to come out of the world to enter into Christ did you get that okay now we were in him we got to come out of the world to get back in him even though we never were out of him okay but you and I came through a perversion but there's a purpose behind it God has a plan you have to come out of unbelief to enter into Faith now you see how he shifted that amen he took us now to a spiritual walk everybody is is celebrating the natural crucifixion 2000 years ago or so and it happened and it has meaning but we realize that in the day we live in there has been a second crucifixion there's been an indictment and it's harsh like the weather today you listen to that message and you find out listen brothers and sisters that the ministry of today is guilty yeah of crucifying the son of God afresh that's why the weather's not good but what they didn't realize is that God brother Branham said this and I may be getting ahead of myself that's okay I'll just hurry up all right he said that the denominational thought process bound the Holy Spirit for nearly 2 000 years now that's an entombment yeah that's right you know what they do whenever somebody dies back in the old days they rap them all up they bind them but brother Branham said never said that the Holy Spirit died because it cannot die but denominationalism bound that Holy Spirit by trying to tie it up and put ownership on it from a human perspective but here's what they forgot to think about while they were busy binding the Holy Spirit to to keep it from accessing the people Jesus was not in the Tomb on Saturday they didn't know that because there was a big Stone in the way they thought he was still bound inside that Doom but he was busy preaching the gospel to the souls that were in prison now brother Branham in the message souls in prison which is about entombment in a way okay declared to us that it looked like that Souls that are in prison and Jesus preaching to them was like the third pool today preaching to the totally lost but that is not all he said he said while the third pull is the word being preached to the totally lost it's for the bride you understand that he didn't say it in that message but he said it in a message after that it's for the bride and that's the difference between you and I and all the other churches on the planet now I'm not talking about the local assembly here I'm talking about you being the church we just had some meetings last weekend for our 11th anniversary and brother Manuel Salazar gets up there and says how in the world could you stay out of church when you are the church if you are in the church you're staying in the church we're not talking about the four walls now we're talking about you as an individual House of God now we realize that entombment requires a tomb what is a tomb it's a place the dictionary says of confinement see what that Spirit tried to do it tries to confine it's still here today it tries to confinement the moving and freedom of the word of God made flesh remember they didn't crucify him for being a good man they didn't even crucify him for being a rotten man because that was a rotten man on death row and they let him go is that right okay whoo okay better settle down place of confinement listen to what it says a building house chamber Vault structure Etc in which a corpse is in turn now brother Branham told us about them cemeteries doesn't require a theologian I am far from an Einstein in the message but I realized that if we'll take what all those great men were looking for through their intellects and education and Academia and we begin to separate the Bible says You must rightly divide the word Hebrews 4 12 says the word of God is sharper and more powerful it's a discerner you must have discernment I know groups of Ministries today that claim to follow this message that don't believe you can have discernment only the prophet they say no that is not scripture that is not message I'll tell you what that is that's a tomb that's a Whited Sepulcher full of Dead Man's Bones that's what the Bible says right still with me so so what we have here is we have a religious spirit it's trying to keep you captive by keeping him captive but we have proof now what day of the week is Friday it's the sixth day of the week that's why he was crucified on Friday because of the number six it's a judgment number is that right now today is Saturday is that right and today is the seventh day of the week and God always runs in mathematics that's why I was really enjoying brother Dutch he brother Branham told us he runs in mathematics is not from Einstein mathematics is from God Amen it's just that man tries to put his two cents worth in and he ends up fudging everything amen he has to amen that's what they're busy doing today in their Laboratories remember when brother Brandon mentioned the the men in the Laboratories pouring the test tubes back and forth and and somebody said stop that don't do that and they just looked up and oh like zombies and kept pouring their little test tubes back and forth look where we're at today the brother mentioned uh uh covet don't tell me that's not some test tubes being poured together and and they think they're helping Humanity what really are they thinking do you think that they think they're trying to kill people and as I've heard population control and ethnic control and race control and and intelligence control and control control control no what they're trying to do and they don't even realize that they're being used by the devil to try to create and eaten yeah [Music] yes amen but it's Satan's Eden already and Satan is the only pastor he's the only Minister he's the only Shepherd he's the only God I know that's occupied by killing his congregation what's the matter with the guy yeah you with me this is Satan's Eden and there's only one group of people that God ordained to be able to withstand the fiery darts of the enemy and everything he has to throw at us and he accomplished it by revealing to you and I what he did on Calvary every bit of it is in here right right I can't hardly preach on Easter without bringing up job but we'll do that tomorrow yeah all right I just got done preaching a series on job not realizing Easter was coming I didn't have him on the ashy for three months or six weeks or one year I probably preached on it for three months but oh there's so much in there but at the end of the day job caught something that apparently nobody else caught and he caught it in such a time where it was critical critical mass I know My Redeemer we'll get there tomorrow listen now let's let's get done with Redemption shall we there there cannot be watch what he says you have to come out of unbelief to enter into Faith there cannot be one thing in your way not one all right can't be a grave can't be a tomb can be a church can be your intellect there cannot be one thing in your way to really have genuine Faith you must absolutely leave everything that's contrary to the word of God behind see behind we're not going backwards to enter into faith and that was the book of Ephesians of the Old Testament Joshua where listen to what he says where Moses represented the law could not save no one but Grace could and here Joshua is the same word like Jesus Jehovah savior and now then we find out that we have come to another Ephesians now brothers and sisters if you haven't caught it and you have you will because I'm going to tell you point blank there's been a second crucifixion of Jesus Christ in our generation amen therefore there has to be another resurrection and brother Branham to me represented Jesus when everybody thought he was in the Tomb laying dead he was busy working he was preaching and God was using him to manifest not the resurrected Christ the way in you and I think he didn't die twice he only needed the Bible said to sacrifice one time but because of denominationalism and religion yes and science forgive me I'm not preaching against scientists but I am preaching against the philosophy of science We Don't Preach against higher education did you all know that brother Branham never preached against like oh wait a minute brother I got 10 quotes but what you don't realize is he was preaching against the spirit that was entering into the system to begin to manipulate and massage and change the Outlook of the young mind starting at a very young age and I'll tell you when it started when did this nation turn its back on God as a nation 1956 and if you go back in your history you'll find out that there was a turn made in 1956 and it started in the school systems with the little bitty pre-case but it was such an infant so if there's a teacher in here please don't I'm not preaching against Joe I feel something I'm not preaching against you I'm wanting you to understand that politics and religion are now two horns on one hand brother Branham said that that that that that that that that that little that little creature there that represented the United States he said it started out like a lamb but it turned into a bison and I'll tell you what I know a few Cowboys and you don't Cowboy a bison he Cowboys you if he feels like running he runs if he feels like taking down the fence you can't stop him if he wants to eat over there in that pasture and he doesn't like it where you've got him he just goes don't get in his way because he'll mow you right now now do you see what's happening in politics don't get in their way no I'm not preaching to your politics but I want you to understand that same Spirit has crept in to the church and now it's coming around the message churches which which you know why you know why it's just now getting here because they realize listen now Satan's not a creator man nope that's the one thing he can't do what what's the other thing he can't bring the word word by word so I was telling brother Wade then if brother Branham and he did make both statements to me bringing the word word by word is creation there are two in that one God Amen it's creating something in you which will raise you up in the day we live in and you'll go from the barnyard to the Eagles Nest you say well brother uh I I I I I'm not I'm not I'm not in the barnyard you were at one time I can prove it I can prove by the words of the Prophet that you well you don't understand now brother I didn't come through the church watch now brother random type the Barnyard as a denominational work is that not right but you forgot the pigsty yeah I come from the pig Style that's right brother I come in and guess what the pig has to do when the call of God begins to call on him the Deep call into the deep he he's he stops Lincoln oh he still looks like a pig then the world was that how does a pig hear an eagle cry remember that same Pig has to come through the Barnyard you see that's why I see what happens in the message churches today not this when you understand I'm attacking Spirits yeah because a lot of folks come to the church so they were already in the barnyard they just didn't know whether they were a chicken or an eagle now the pig he gets a double power of transformation remember the brother that brother Branham talked to and he said now brother Bradham I don't want to die because I want to make the rapture he said you get a double blessing brother he says you get resurrected and then you go in the Rapture now the pig that was in the world he gets resurrected and then he walks through the Barnyard and here's the eagle crying on what's that what is that he was an eagle all the time he just had a pig nature that Nature's got to change it now now when you get to the Barnyard that nature changes and you think you're a chicken yeah but you're really an eagle you just don't know the difference has you have you ever noticed when when birds are hatched they're really ugly and and they've got no feathers in their heads they're all bald and they just flop around you know and their heads gets sorry you know and they can barely squeak exactly but what happens is the food chain begins to change amen metamorphosis in a way they're all just little bitty scraggly birds that can barely move and they don't know one from another but somehow over time because brother Branham said the eagle just can't eat them bucks now when he said that brother wait I'm going to tell you what came to me now brother Brown didn't say this so I want to make that clear but what came to me was there's a chick missing every once in a while you know the mother it's not a cartoon yeah five six she just says I'll lay more eggs I'll have more chicks I lay more eggs and I'll have more chicks I'll multiply I'll multiply I'll multiply I'll bring fourth after them but after a while this one bird gets twice as big as the other ones no he doesn't know he's an eagle he just looking down at the rest of the congregation going what in the world and because he's an eagle I'm telling you every once in a while a chick has to come up missing yeah I mean it's just a natural occurrences the chick has to come up missing you know and that's and you know that's like a church member right that you know if you was raised in a barnyard of a church and people go they don't want to be here no more yeah yeah come on hopefully the eagle didn't get you think about it there was very few mice around in that barnyard you know snakes didn't come strange barnyard and then after a while that eagle began to get twice as big as the mother now the mother's a chicken doesn't know any better it thinks hey look at Junior there he's going to be in the NFL huh look at him run he outstrides them all here's that eagle cry what's that see he was predestinated he was going to resurrect by representation how was he going to resurrect he's already alive so are we God's not dead he's still alive but what the devil is trying to convince us of is that he's not here and he is and if he gets here he's bound when he gets here that's what you and I do with it that's what brother random indicted the ministry for us keeping him bound so that when he gets free in the congregation that's right the people can't use it and harness it for the purpose it was intended God is good so I'll just stay with the eagle story it's it's right here in my nose but and I could read to you all the things that brother but he said some tremendous things about the eagle our brother was preaching last weekend and he quoted a quote by the way at our meetings you're gonna pick up your pen and write right now he mentioned a quote brother Branham said and I started to write down and I said well there's bald eagles I'm becoming one there's golden eagles there's Harpy eagles there's sea eagles anybody been at the ocean in Beach lately they're seals you know and you can go down the list and I think there's 17 19 15 20 different kinds of eagles and then subspecies let me tell you something about an eagle I've been fishing in Haynes Alaska yeah yeah and you catch a nice salmon and that eagle wants it yep you ain't getting it I don't care if it's on your hook yeah he takes it from you so I began to think and this brother was quoting and he quoted a quote where brother banham said true Eagles and I said look at that there's another Eagle possibility brother it ain't balding gold it ain't harpy it ain't see it doesn't eat roadkill did you all know that there are eagles that eat Roadkill ERS not every Eagle will no but there are certain families of eagles that will just take any old scrap they'll take it away they'll keep guard over it from the vultures but I found out last weekend there's an eagle that can't miss it's a true because that's what brother Branham said and that's what you are yes yes and you may not realize it but when we were in that denominational thought process which still happens today to people even sitting in message churches why I know people that become uh uh isolationists in their own church ah well who's preaching today well I don't feel like coming because I know but there might be a little piece of meat in there that you gotta have you don't know right um that's right it's getting quiet in here you need it I need it regardless of food you say well well that brother's off go anyway yeah let me tell you why because brother Branham said after that eagle began to get a little bigger and it began to develop feathers and it it still didn't know it was an eagle now and it heard that cry still didn't know it was Ingle but it whooped what was that that has a deep call and a deep response oh my goodness and he started looking around now he wasn't impuning and degrading the chickens he was only thinking about one thing he was thinking about where did that come from and the next time that eagle cried it said come on up by representation that's what the woman at the well had she didn't realize it but she was an eagle in the barnyard of humanity now watch this want to know why I tell you to leave the chickens alone you don't have to touch them you don't have to say nothing to him you just flap those wings when Mama says come up a little higher and brother Branham says where do you get the fence post but let me tell you something I grew up around farms and ranches and if an eagle or a hawk or any bird of prey gets on a fence post and he's flapping his wings the chickens are running for cover because they see the shadow of a bird of prey and that's an instinct go then you find yourself all by yourself on the fence post I gotta find a church see what happened to me in the world is I wasn't happy on the inside and I wanted to find a piece and I didn't know God I didn't know Jesus Christ but I wanted to find peace and contentment and reality and and and and all the things that we desire if he knew what he was doing brother Wade I didn't realize that was when I was up on the fence post I hadn't gone to church yet I was up on the fence post and all my worldly friends disappeared didn't want to be around me no more why because I'd be preaching to him I remember the first week I got saved I found out about the cloud and the Life Magazine I went down to the local Auction Yard and got three or four magazines for 25 cents a piece back then it was a long time ago I've been doing this 45 years and then I'm witnessing to one of my best friends in his bedroom we were Motocross Racing buddies I'm sitting on the foot of his bed by the way there's a bookshelf across with me and I'm preaching to him I'm telling them a God sent a prophet and that there was a cloud and that you know I was immature but I was an eagle I just wow wow I was just going off thinking everybody was going to hear it I didn't know and I'm just going at it with him and he's like wow yeah well um yeah wow but brother Wade right there as I was testifying to him about God sending a cloud in 1963 lo and behold God is my witness right on his bookshelf was a Britannica encyclopedia 64-year book which in it has the picture of the cloud for 1963. I whooped that thing off there and I opened it up and I said there it is right there and he was like you must have known that was there I said I had no idea I'd heard that it was in one of the encyclopedias a yearbook he he had it on his Shelf the next week he moved yeah yeah he moved he moved out to San Luis Obispo from the from the mainlander the center of California where I lived but I didn't know I thought wow man I thought everybody would accept this because I thought everybody I guess was an eagle I didn't realize that I was walking with the chickens and the pigs and the Pigs die yeah see how God operates brothers and sisters what you don't realize is that if you were in him you're still there yes yes he don't lose one all that the father has given me will come to me and I won't lose one the devil can't snatch one from me that's what the resurrection means to me I wasn't there 2 000 years ago but he's here today the resurrected Christ is now living in US I caught something last week as the brother was preaching and we got a picture of the pillar of fire up there and he gets the picture off the wall and he begins to show and he's talking about how that how that this Pillar of Fire speaks hmm yeah what speaks spoke to Moses then he began to preach on how this same Pillar of Fire on the day of Pentecost broke off from himself but it never diminished like the fishes in the loaves it was still the same size and the same Pillar of Fire why they had leftovers with the fishes and the lows can I take my coat off I'm going to preach a little bit okay look at that thank you and it come to me it should come to you that Pillar of Fire was in that burning bush that pill or fire was in the photograph y I believe that Pillar of Fire was in the hearts of every believer starting from the day of Pentecost so guess what brother that makes us a burning bush there's an attraction on the mountain they just don't know what it is but if they turn aside and they Wonder hey what happened to you brother I haven't seen you in years well you got time sit down let me tell you how this works there is a pillar of fire burning in my heart named Jesus Christ Jesus Christ he was a man two thousand years ago oh but when Paul met him they all met him yeah and he went back Amen to God is that right he said he came from God and he went back to God and the prophet of God says you and I have the same life in us so not if we came from God but because we came from God we're going back to God but we've always been a part of God you say well brother I can read to you quotes where brother Branham says there ain't nothing good in us I got those same quotes I want to ask you a question who are you brother Branham said you don't see me this ain't me there's a man in here yes who can turn on the light there's a man in here who turns water to wine walks on the water and gives sight to the blind he gave back life to the ones that's daddy fed for a thousand with seven loaves of bread yep do you believe that yeah that's the resurrected Christ today brothers and sisters he didn't die on Calvary so people could nail themselves to the Cross every Easter no died on Calvary so that the life that he lived can come back and be imparted into each and every one of you and I and what would it do to us it would transform us there's a question in question I'm off my notes now there's a question and questions and answers that somebody asked brother Bradham if they'll explain the translation brother Bradham does not mention Enoch nope he says let me tell you about Abraham and he begins to talk about Abraham and his journey and that Journey that Abraham took which you and I are on tonight began to turn Abraham from an old man who was dried up into a young man who could produce children now the church was a little behind him now watch we don't know whether the church Sarah had gotten the Revelation at the same time that uh that that the transformation at the same time that Abraham did because she wouldn't participate she said I gotta uh uh Hagar here I got an idea see what's wrong see what happens with the church I got this idea lay them ideas down would you like throw them in the garbage can take God and God alone and once you get him brothers and sisters you'll find out he's not entombed that's not a gloomy day outside that's the same spirit that falls on the just and the unjust and we live by it you say but there's too much rain I'll tell you there's too much snow you don't have to shovel rain you come to my house and you'll be shoveling snow you don't believe me listen to what the prophet says I got it I got it here I'm just going to stay off my notes and stop pretty quick thank you but you know what it's getting hot in here I can tell listen to this I got trials tribulations and tests written down here brother it says from the message I know amen I'm gonna finish that my redeemer liveth but it's I know the date there 419 of 60. this is what the prophet of God said think about it we ask for comfort and peace there I was kingford still asking for comfort and peace but my peace and comfort now come from within yeah because there's a resurrected Christ and inside of us that means that we are able to do and perform all of those signs wonders and miracles that he did he said if you believe me these signs shall follow you people are so oh get out of the Barnyard get up on the post that's not your final destination the the fits post is just as high as you could get and the chickens are running amen you haven't even flown yet you did what a turkey does when he wants to roost but mama says come on up you're an eagle and she keeps calling that word keeps talking to you that Revelation keeps coming it's spiritual food and new season it keeps feeding it keeps building faith muscles it keeps building spiritual bodies we ask for comfort and peace God gives us the best he could give us what is it the next sin says trials and tribulation oh right away people go I don't want to serve that God yeah oh and your life is any better yeah see what happens is if we recognize that he gives us his best through trials and tribulations we become real genuine amen God born God felt god-builded God begotten children of God that's our goal not everybody wants to do that most people want to hang around here for a while and save some more money and convert their cash into gold and okay it's not going to help you you want to know why you can accumulate and amass as much riches as you want you can have a food shelter you can have gold piled up in your safe and guess who's showing up if the IRS don't come if the FBI don't come if the doj don't come if Hunter don't come your neighbor's coming yeah you know the guy that's got the cash of AK-47s and 10 million rounds of ammo and his oh I wish guys like that in Flagstaff they asked me how come I don't carry a gun in church I said I don't need a gun in church according to what the prophet said bullets will bounce right off you and if they don't brother Tom they'll you'll go home is that right that's what you that's what he was testifying God don't lose a one who in the world wants to stick around here do you think it's going to get better come on it's snowballing yeah it's an avalanche of sin and unbelief and craziness but do you want peace and contentment and comfort trial and tribulation is coming your way but God Made You to withstand every one of them by his life being placed in you and to finish about representation now brother Branham explain to us the translation of the Bride okay I will let me use Abraham as an example he talks about Abraham in the journey you're on it and that journey is transforming you by hearing the word of God and it alone and brother Branham says that word that you're taking in begins to start to form a body and that body begins to form on the inside of you and if you keep taking in the word if you keep bringing in the eagle food you will see the resurrected Christ in your very own life then you won't care what comes or goes you won't care what the government's doing or the banks are failing or even if your car is broke down brother or cars in your case because he's given you his best he's forming a character by the building of that body inside of you and brother Branham says this in closing did you know the resurrection Lays in you now we know that what the scripture means they without us I'm telling you those folks that have gone on before us you may not realize it but they're rooting they're pulling they're shouting now there is a half hour of Silence in everybody's life that's right because you begin to look at yourself and brother Branham said that's seventh seal they were oh it was pretty awesome man when you come to the real genuine Revelation that God the Eternal God the god that ha don't try to figure this out you'll become Einstein what I didn't tell you about Einstein if you ever watch any of documentaries on him he spent the last years of his life laying in bed with chalkboards in front of him trying to figure out how to change that equation into a final answer he didn't realize all the time that the James Webb super telescope was going to go out and look for it because he mentioned Hubble so they got the idea that telescope is one million miles out there and it's got these big wings that fold out and they're reflective mirrors and they're and they're sending and wanting to receive signals guess what the mirrors are made out of does anybody know it's gold thank you and the way they explained it when I was hearing the documentary on it I know this sounds crazy but the guy took his wedding band off and he laid it on the table and he said there's about five six or seven of those wedding bands and those giant mirrors that are yards and yards and yards wide yeah yeah it was funny that he used a wedding band and that it's gold gold is the most conductive and reflective substance that we know of but it has to be beaten out so thin that you can see through it and it reflects like a mirror guess what they're looking for they're looking for the same thing that Einstein and Hubble and all the rest of the astronomers in Galileo and everybody was looking for they were looking for the god that's in you we could have saved them trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars and and and tens of twenties of years and said he's here quit wasting your time and your money but you know what I heard brother Dutch say this that the astronomers astrologers mathematicians scientists philosophers etc etc won't admit it's Jesus Christ [Music] it won't admit it they believe in a higher being they just don't want anybody to know that because then they don't need to teach anybody anything is that right it's exactly right you love him yeah it's a bodybuilding inside of you yeah guess what it started with the same Pillar of Fire that built the body 2 000 years ago to walk this Earth 33 and a half years and hang on the cross for you and me so that we can become joint heirs with it please stand please stand please stand praise the Lord I know you don't want me to because you know I can't but I'm going to sing to you these musicians would come I can't even say the word musician you asked me why I'm happy so I'll just tell you why because my sins are gone and when I meet the scoffers who ask me where they are I say my sins are gone where'd they go They're underneath the blood on the cross of Calvary as far removed as darkness is [Music] praise praise God my sins are gone twice [Music] [Music] [Music] that's good enough for me praise God my sins are gone when Satan constitute me yeah that's right come on now say it my sins are gone you've got me into trouble but Jesus got me out I'm glad my sins are gone [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] praise God my sins are gone for Jesus [Applause] with all my heart I say I know let's sing it to it let me hear you hold there underneath as far removed and darkness is [Music] good enough for me praise God my sins are gone hey man do you believe that though do you believe that you know he threw them in the sea of his own forgetfulness backwards where we can't go [Music] he threw him in the sea putting no fishing sign up I said don't go there no more but what do we do brother Tom we take a fishing pole we throw it out there and we bring them back out or we try to give him another hand that was good brother brother Chris can pour his heart out quicker than anybody I've ever seen it took me two and a half hours to say what he said yeah I know you can you can do it tomorrow but we appreciate the Lord and the Ministries that we hear the ministers uh the different ways of of of you know there's different ways to get to Atlanta you know and you got five folds of it there's a map that you that's folded up by the time that fold is five-fold if you unfold one fold you might could get 20 miles down the road you fun fold it again you might get 20 more miles down the road but you'll never get to your destination until you file and take all five folds and open them up and let the fivefold ministry help us that's why we believe in a powerful Ministry we don't believe in a one-fold we believe in a five-fold Ministry that will pour their heart out and the only way you're going to get it and I'm going to get it is that way we can press play all we want to but I promise you you will not get perfected the Bible says without a five-fold minister amen can't do it according to the Bible to be perfected you got to listen to a man and you know what brother around me said that's the hardest thing for one man to do is believe another man well you know what I don't believe brother Chris I believe that God is in him that just spoke to us through that human vessel now that way I do believe brother Chris hey man now we're going to go eat a bite of natural food now we appreciate all of you coming we thank brother Chris again for pouring his heart out there's so many nuggets and I want to tell you if you weren't here last night you almost missed the Rapture that's why I'm telling you y'all miss church and you think boys that ain't nothing just another you missed a visitation of God last night from God not from some man you've missed a visitation brother Dutch Scott preached a masterpiece so I'll adjure you if you have not heard that or watched it that's why we put it online so you can watch it you need to watch that I'm gonna go back and watch it myself again because I'm telling you it was full of nuggets he almost two hours that man priest it didn't seem like 15 minutes when somebody's saying something you slide off into eternity and you listen to the Eternal Word of God and it just keeps going on and keeps going on and keeps going on we sure appreciate the five full ministry we appreciate everyone brother Tom and all the different ones too the ministry we have here we sure do appreciate we we need to bind together hey man you realize today is what the seventh day right today's the seventh day today's Saturday and you know what Jesus is not on the Earth two thousand years ago he's silent the Bible says silence in heaven for the space of half an hour he wasn't up there [Music] he was down preaching to the souls in prison right but you know what he was doing he was doing what we've been preaching every sermon millions of sermons for 2000 years that's what he was doing during that time of Silence there was nothing going on and then up from the grave he arose amen and he didn't rise for himself he rose for me and you I want you to understand that he did not come up for himself he didn't come up and get Glory of his own self he came up to get glory to give it to you [Music] he walked out of that tomb as brother Dutch said he walked out of that tomb and those feet that had nail prints on them he said I don't think he was down there in Hell tiptoeing he went Hallelujah he wanted the devil to know he was the mighty conqueror even with nail prints in his feet in his hands he was a mighty conqueror looked like a bad day like today like like brother Dutch was talking about the sermon was Good Friday it didn't look very good if you look from the outside it didn't look very good very dark moon lost its life all the stars lost their life there was no light it was the darkest day that ever was to a to man but not to a Christian we know that had to be the part of the play and the plan that we've been talking about the Plan of Redemption that was a plan God had and that was per that was part of that plan and today we have seen part of that plan being given to each one of us and we appreciate uh brother Chris again and sister Joanna for coming and we love them with the love of the Lord and love all of you with the love of the Lord and we wish you'd stay around and eat um it's just going to rain on you if you go outside so I appreciate brother Tom and his family coming and then we want to try to get to maybe get a fellowship meeting back into the summertime sometime for the Tony and different ones that they would they'd try to we try to get it back together but I miss the fellowship meetings I really do I miss the fellowship meetings because it's a fellowship we come to fellowship with each other and and do his brother Tom said he'd come up here and he gave us a little snippet of what was going on in his mind because usually a minister when he comes up here I hope he speaks his mind right he gave us a little snippet of what's been going on and you think well that was just five minutes to me it's an eternity of what's going on and what's happening and what's going on in the world and the different things each one of us we bring it all together and it's a big story it's a big picture and it's not a story that's a story like a fiction it's non-fiction the what we what we speak is non-fiction amen and with Einstein you know Einstein came on the Earth the greatest mind that ever was produced by human you understand what I'm saying the greatest mind that was ever produced by a man and a woman to human beings but thank God you and I we might have missed that we can't sit down and listen to Einstein break down the theory of relativity but we had a spiritual Einstein that came from a mother and father called Branham but he caught the mind of God and he was a spiritual Einstein I believe if you'd have got that natural Einstein and brother ran them together they might have been something went on it would have been a happening because they would have sat there and fed off of each other but thank God they didn't because they gave it to us but I like what we were talking about this uh yesterday brother Chris was talking about going forward you know you take and if you look at what Einstein is teaching was that if you could look through Infinity if you could look you know obviously it's in a curve all right but what did he say he said if man could look with infinite eyesight what would you see he said you see the back of your head there's you there's your new body he just didn't know what to call it Einstein just said you see the back of your head no we see the new body because that's our Eternal that we step into it's just a curve and we jump in and take off all right visitors go first um we'll pray over the food here for those of you that go to church here next Sunday brother Dale's 83rd birthday will be next Sunday and we're gonna have a birthday party afterwards uh after the second service and we appreciate everybody that come we appreciate um um the visitors that are here most of you have already been here before but we sure appreciate you coming and being a part of the fellowship tomorrow it's not ending tomorrow we will have church here 9 45 and we'll have brother brother Chris just hang on it gets gooder if I know Chris long this is just a piece of it tomorrow will be a good one hey man I just believe that I just believe that we're as brother Chris we were talking about I believe you know it says uh a true eagle I believe we're in the true part we're not just an eagle we're true Eagles and and that doesn't make us big-headed and separate ourselves let God separate us yes right God you want it does it anyway God will separate us from the world I promise you that we'll not be chickens unless you are a chicken you're not going to be one you're going to be separated from that barnyard and we uh we know that there's one thing for sure we're heading closer to getting out of here one day further one day closer one day further on this journey is one day closer to where we can all be together not have to say goodbye and I want to see you and Dad Race by the time I do well there'll be no bedding in heaven but he just might outrun you I've known my dad a long time he got some long legs but we enjoyed having brother Tom and his family and I see now oh there's Theron and uh her husband with it they've just been recently about a year year now two years good grief time flies two years but good to have you with us and let's go
