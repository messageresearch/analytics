[26:32] to me i i want you to look to title what
[26:34] i said the spoken seals of matthew 24.
[26:37] i don't know if you guys know it jesus
[26:39] spoke the seals
[26:40] in matthew 24 spoke them
[26:44] john wrote symbol form what they were
[26:47] what he saw and then we had a prophet
[26:49] come for the third part of this to give
[26:51] us the revelation of what was spoke
[26:54] and what was put in symbol form so see i
[26:56] have
[26:57] i have no question where i'm at in this
[27:00] great scheme of god
[27:01] is that right and brother wade's been
[27:03] preaching on the eternal redemption this
[27:05] kind of falls right in that line
[27:06] so we're going to talk about kind of
[27:08] some of the things that i think that we
[27:09] missed
[27:10] that we need to get caught up to where
[27:12] we're at right
[27:14] that's what it is okay so we're going to
[27:16] turn in your bibles if you want to
[27:17] follow along
[27:18] matthew 24 1 and jesus went out and
[27:20] departed from the temple
[27:22] and his disciples came to him for to
[27:23] show him the buildings of the temple
[27:25] they had been to the church that morning
[27:27] on the sabbath
[27:29] jesus had went in there they had read
[27:30] the scrolls they had all had a good time
[27:32] they were leaving
[27:33] and the the apostles said look at this
[27:35] temple that our fathers
[27:36] and that's a beautiful we got to we
[27:38] built this pretty church and jesus said
[27:41] the whole thing's going to be destroyed
[27:42] there ain't going to be a rock left on
[27:44] another one
[27:45] you think i want to shower them and then
[27:46] you know what he did after he preached
[27:48] that
[27:48] he walked right up on the mount of
[27:49] olives didn't explain it just
[27:52] walked right up it's what he's doing and
[27:54] jesus said unto them see not
[27:55] all these things see not right
[27:59] the kingdom of god is not seeing by
[28:01] observation see not
[28:03] verily i say to you there shall not be
[28:04] left here one stone upon another
[28:07] that shall not be thrown down do you
[28:10] think that wasn't a shock to them
[28:12] shocker huh and as he said upon the
[28:14] mount of olives disciple come to him
[28:16] privately right privately
[28:19] saying tell us right when shall these
[28:22] things be
[28:23] what shall be the sign of thy coming and
[28:26] of the end of the world so there's three
[28:28] things that he's answering here three
[28:30] questions jesus is going to answer all
[28:31] three right
[28:32] that's what they are shall these things
[28:34] when shall these things be when shall
[28:36] all
[28:36] the temple be tore down we already know
[28:38] that's history titus did that
[28:40] what shall be the sign of thy coming so
[28:43] remember
[28:44] israel has a sign they seeketh after a
[28:46] sign
[28:47] there's going to be a sign given of thy
[28:50] coming
[28:51] and of the end of the world
[28:54] so this has to do with events times he's
[28:57] showing you exactly what's going to be
[29:00] before the end okay that's exactly what
[29:02] and jesus is going to speak these things
[29:05] so this what is the original word
[29:08] spoken words original seed he spoke it
[29:11] right
[29:12] that's if you're going to start
[29:14] something didn't don't doesn't god have
[29:16] to send a prophet to speak at the start
[29:18] events to start happening jesus spoke
[29:21] something here to start something is
[29:23] that right
[29:23] and that's what he's doing here okay
[29:25] let's bow our heads if you would
[29:27] dear heavenly father we thank you for
[29:29] the reading of the word now i pray that
[29:30] you're quickening it to the people
[29:32] lord it's not a dead letter where we
[29:34] live it's a quickening power
[29:36] it's a living where it's made flesh in
[29:38] the people the word and you are the word
[29:40] it's
[29:41] god made flesh in this end time lord in
[29:44] and through his bride lord
[29:45] now be with us in this service and give
[29:47] us leadership in jesus christ's name we
[29:49] ask it
[29:50] amen you may be seated lord bless you i
[29:52] want to read a quote out of the sixth
[29:54] seal brother branham preached first seal
[29:56] through the fifth seal
[29:57] brother branham hardly mentioned matthew
[29:59] 24. he gets to the sixth seal and all of
[30:02] a sudden he's bringing into focus
[30:04] the matthew 24 and there's a real
[30:07] purpose in
[30:08] that because brother branham is trying
[30:09] to show you exactly where we're at
[30:12] when that brother last night i don't
[30:13] know where he's at i can't see him here
[30:15] but he said
[30:15] okay you asked we're kind of where we're
[30:17] at right when you see the covet falling
[30:20] don't you think where are we at in this
[30:21] great
[30:22] right all the events you see what's
[30:24] happening in the political world you see
[30:26] america falling apart
[30:28] and you're saying where are we at you
[30:30] know you want to know don't you want to
[30:31] know where you're at today
[30:33] be kind of kind of be senseless you
[30:35] didn't know where you're at
[30:36] and so here brother brown's going to
[30:38] stop and he's going to
[30:39] he takes time he says okay now i'm going
[30:42] to preach out of matthew 24.
[30:44] i'm going to show you in matthew 24 what
[30:46] was spoken and i'm going to
[30:47] line it up with revelation chapter six
[30:50] what was put in symbol form does
[30:53] everybody understand
[30:54] remember we said yesterday if you could
[30:56] hear a message i could hear a message
[30:58] you may hear more or less of what i hear
[31:00] and i may hear more or less
[31:02] so by putting these two together you're
[31:04] going to get the whole scope of what's
[31:06] going on
[31:07] with just matthew 24 it's hard to put it
[31:09] together
[31:10] but when you get and combine it with
[31:12] revelation chapter 6
[31:14] it'll give you a clear view of exactly
[31:16] where we're at
[31:18] okay and that's where we all want to be
[31:20] he says here the sea
[31:21] i'm going to jump to the sixth seal and
[31:23] i thought under this sixth seal when the
[31:25] holy spirit broke it forth there
[31:27] i seen what it was then i thought i'd be
[31:30] it'd be a good thing to give the class
[31:33] i gotta line it up where i can see i'm
[31:35] getting blind as i get older
[31:37] to give the class a little something
[31:39] different tonight
[31:40] his approach in the sixth seal he's
[31:42] gonna give something a little different
[31:44] you aren't just gonna hear me speak i'm
[31:45] going to put it in the scriptures for
[31:47] you to read he did all of them
[31:49] but really focus in on matthew 24 and
[31:52] revelation chapter 6 okay because it
[31:55] might be
[31:56] uh where am i it might be tiring you
[31:59] just
[32:00] i did that i put it in red shame on me
[32:03] listen to me talk talking at the time so
[32:05] i thought that we'd do something
[32:07] different okay
[32:08] this great event was sealed under the
[32:10] blood of the mystery of redemption
[32:12] what's he been preaching
[32:14] eternal redemption right
[32:18] does everybody understand that it's
[32:19] going right along with what he's saying
[32:21] right along with what you asked
[32:23] okay now the lamb has it in his hand is
[32:26] going to break it now let's look to
[32:27] matthew the 24th chapter
[32:29] okay you go there if you want the lamb
[32:31] himself speaking
[32:35] not just simple form speaking
[32:39] okay he's emphasizing that now anyone
[32:42] knows that christ is the author of the
[32:43] whole book as far as he's concerned
[32:45] but this is his speech here or his
[32:48] sermon too now i want to i want you to
[32:50] read this
[32:50] this right here what i got in yelling
[32:52] very important listen to what it says
[32:54] does everybody know that when jesus
[32:56] speaks through the we always said this i
[32:58] know brother samuel you probably
[33:00] he said well the seals are the gentiles
[33:02] trumpets are the jews
[33:03] everybody ever anybody ever heard that
[33:05] am i the only one that heard that
[33:08] right so if jesus is speaking to the
[33:11] jews and he's talking seals isn't that a
[33:13] little different
[33:14] i thought the plan of redemption for the
[33:15] jews is through the trumpets
[33:17] everybody understand what i'm talking
[33:19] about so
[33:21] right away brother brahma is going to
[33:22] point us to something and show you how
[33:24] they overlap
[33:25] the seals and the trumpets ever laugh
[33:27] and they're all a part of the plan
[33:29] of redemption redemption for the
[33:32] gentiles
[33:33] redemption for the jews does everybody
[33:35] understand there's two classes of people
[33:37] look at this here he said so he's
[33:39] speaking out
[33:40] out of whoops i hit the button sorry i
[33:43] do that at my church too
[33:44] did i get that lost hold on where are we
[33:48] at here
[33:49] technical difficulties uh
[33:53] wait a minute what happened
[33:57] where'd the quote go oh right there it
[33:59] is right here
[34:00] they changed my colors already did that
[34:03] color change or am i going crazy
[34:06] did the brothers do that to me back
[34:08] there
[34:10] well thank you i appreciate what did he
[34:11] say he stuck his head through there
[34:14] well you lost me there i was looking for
[34:15] red thank you for that
[34:18] i thought i'd really gotten a mess here
[34:19] okay so listen to what he says here
[34:22] his speech his sermon to the the people
[34:26] and to the jews
[34:29] amen this matthew 24 is not just to the
[34:32] gentiles
[34:33] it's the gentile and jews amen who's he
[34:35] talking to in matthew 24
[34:38] jews were there but he said this sermon
[34:41] is not just for these jews that i'm
[34:43] addressing out here it's to the people
[34:44] too
[34:46] does everybody see what he's saying okay
[34:48] so this is very important
[34:50] now i want to hold your book like this
[34:52] matthew 24 and revelation 6
[34:54] like this let's compare something here
[34:56] just a little bit so watch this now
[34:58] and you can find out just how it is see
[35:00] what the lamb here is showing exactly in
[35:02] symbol form what he
[35:03] said over here in the word right
[35:07] okay doing exactly so that makes it
[35:11] right so that makes it right the mouth
[35:14] of two or three witnesses let these
[35:15] things be established right
[35:17] doing exactly so that makes it right now
[35:20] that there is to it here
[35:21] here's one he's talking to it and here's
[35:24] where it happens see
[35:25] it's just a perfect vindication now look
[35:29] let's look at 24th chapter of saint
[35:31] matthew revelation 6 compare the 24th
[35:33] chapter of matthew
[35:34] we all know that was the chapter that
[35:36] every scholar
[35:39] every scholar no every
[35:42] nobody's excluded out of this every
[35:46] scholar
[35:46] every person goes to talk to about the
[35:48] tribulation period
[35:51] what's the seal is he preaching in when
[35:53] he's talking about this
[35:56] now i'm going to tell you there's two
[35:57] parts of the sixth seal i'm gonna get a
[35:58] little ahead of myself
[36:00] one part of it is investigating judgment
[36:04] the other part of it is tribulation
[36:08] does everybody understand what i'm
[36:09] talking about so if you're putting a
[36:11] sixth seal all the way over there in the
[36:13] tribulation period then what does that
[36:15] have to do with me
[36:19] right does everybody understand remember
[36:22] that's what spoke of theirs to all the
[36:24] people
[36:25] amen you're a part of these things you
[36:28] understand
[36:30] i see your faces you're not got it yet
[36:32] but you're going to before we get
[36:33] through today
[36:34] i promise you i'm going to cover it okay
[36:36] so we know that this chat
[36:37] every scholar every one of them this is
[36:39] a tribulation period comes out of the
[36:41] 24th
[36:42] uh chapter now i'm going to go to the
[36:43] first seal so i'm going to go to the
[36:44] first seal and show you where he's
[36:46] talking matthew 24 and he's talking in
[36:48] six
[36:48] to show you he's one says a little more
[36:51] than the other
[36:52] when you go to matthew 24 saint luke 17
[36:55] is the same
[36:56] luke is telling what he heard matthew is
[36:59] telling what
[37:00] he heard and it'll be a little different
[37:03] here you'll get more here than what you
[37:05] get here
[37:06] and between the two of them it'll paint
[37:08] a picture for you and you can draw it
[37:09] together
[37:10] and it'll make everything clear has
[37:12] everybody got it that's what jesus
[37:14] all these things that jesus does the
[37:16] seals and in 6 and 24 he's just trying
[37:19] to get it to us is that right
[37:21] you know as a preacher how many times we
[37:22] preach the same sermon over and over
[37:24] one service we take one approach another
[37:26] one another and then finally everybody
[37:28] i'll look out there and you're all going
[37:31] you got it when i'm looking out there
[37:33] and some of you going
[37:34] and others are going you know your face
[37:37] responds
[37:39] one of my favorite quotes in the message
[37:41] brother branham was preaching one time
[37:42] he said
[37:43] i wish you could see the devil's face
[37:44] now who
[37:46] is he looking at you ever think of that
[37:50] he was looking at the people do you know
[37:53] you will express how you feel
[37:55] when i used to be a deacon in our church
[37:57] i sat on a platform and i could watch
[37:58] people come and what i did is i looked
[38:00] at people if they come in and they were
[38:02] limping they got problems
[38:05] if you got pain you will not smile
[38:08] unless you're crazy
[38:11] right when you're not happy do you smile
[38:14] somebody help me here so when i would
[38:18] watch people and i look at people i'd
[38:20] see a sad face
[38:21] i'd you know what i'd instantly do i
[38:22] dropped my head and start praying for
[38:23] them
[38:24] i know something's bothering them it may
[38:25] be depression it may be whatever's after
[38:28] them
[38:29] lord i'm praying for them that you'll
[38:32] get them through you know what i'm
[38:33] saying because
[38:34] i want to see everybody smiling don't
[38:36] you i don't know about you but i want to
[38:37] be happy
[38:40] i've been through a lot in my natural
[38:41] body the last four years and i am
[38:43] determined to be happy today
[38:46] i could have died it could have really
[38:48] went south for me you understand
[38:50] but i am determined to be happy i am not
[38:54] going to major on sad i'm going to major
[38:56] on being happy
[38:57] and god wants you to be happy this
[39:00] morning
[39:01] he gave you the best thing he could give
[39:04] you this message of the hour
[39:06] the sweetest thing it's sweet do you
[39:09] understand
[39:09] i have partaken of it and this message
[39:12] is sweet
[39:13] the bitterness comes when you digest it
[39:15] and the persecution
[39:16] the tribulations when people die out of
[39:18] our audience my mama passed away three
[39:20] years ago
[39:21] i can't hardly talk about her i'll start
[39:23] crying so i can't hardly talk about her
[39:26] because i'd loved her so much
[39:28] you know we suffer many things in this
[39:30] natural body
[39:31] god's not mad at you you understand it's
[39:35] a character builder
[39:37] i've come out on the other side i know
[39:38] i'm not the man i was four years ago i
[39:40] know i'm not
[39:42] so the first seal let's go there matthew
[39:44] 24 4 if you want to catch it and jesus
[39:46] answered and said
[39:48] uh did i do that again
[39:51] where am i at where am i at
[39:56] oh send it to them okay there you go
[39:57] thank you i may have to get off my
[39:58] clicker and let them click
[40:00] i got two 70 inch monitor in mind and i
[40:02] go back back boy i guess cruz
[40:04] so matthew 24 4. and jesus answered and
[40:06] said unto them take heed that no man
[40:08] deceive you
[40:09] for many shall come in my name saying i
[40:12] am christ and shall deceive many
[40:14] look at the sixth seal notice now we're
[40:16] going to read first
[40:17] then he answered them and said to them
[40:19] thank you
[40:21] he's going to start to answering now
[40:24] and we want to compare it with the seals
[40:26] now watch the first seals revelation 6 1
[40:28] 2. okay now we read 6-1-2 and i saw the
[40:33] lamb when he had opened one of the seals
[40:34] and i heard as it were a noise of a
[40:35] thunder
[40:36] one of the four beasts saying come and
[40:38] see the first four seals
[40:41] the beasts say come and see everybody
[40:44] knows what those beasts are right
[40:46] lion ox man
[40:50] flying eagle amen i tell the church
[40:54] i don't like to use eagle i like flying
[40:56] eagle
[40:57] there's difference in an eagle's person
[40:58] on a rock waiting for a rabbit to be
[41:00] killed down in the valley or go kill it
[41:02] i want to be a flying eagle because you
[41:04] know what a flying eagle is he sees a
[41:06] far
[41:06] off this is a flying eagle we have come
[41:09] up
[41:10] hither i'm not just an eagle sitting on
[41:12] a mountain somewhere
[41:14] looking down in the valley i am flying
[41:17] and i'm seeing a far off
[41:18] all the way to the new heaven and new
[41:20] earth flying eagle
[41:22] okay i love that i don't want to just be
[41:24] an eagle i want to be a flying eagle
[41:26] you know the eagle that's down the
[41:28] ground he's usually going through that
[41:29] what dropping season
[41:30] remember i'm not dropping where i'm at
[41:33] i'm flying
[41:35] okay i want you to know that okay so
[41:38] then he answered and said compared with
[41:40] okay and i saw the lamb when it opened
[41:42] okay
[41:42] and i saw it behold a white horse so you
[41:45] have a lion
[41:46] and a white horse every time the devil
[41:48] does something god raises the standard
[41:50] against
[41:50] it the white horse come out and then god
[41:53] raised a standard to get
[41:54] a lion is that right okay
[41:58] and what did he do the white horse he
[42:00] hadn't a bow he had no arrows
[42:02] he's just a bluff the antichrist is a
[42:06] bluff brother
[42:08] antichrist can't faze me anymore he's a
[42:10] bluff he's got a bow but it ain't going
[42:11] to get me
[42:12] got no arrows right okay uh he went
[42:15] forth conquering to conquer and who
[42:17] would find this fellow was
[42:18] antichrist matthew 24 now 4 and 5. and
[42:22] jesus answered said to them
[42:23] take he that no man deceive you for many
[42:25] shall come in my name saying i'm crushed
[42:27] shall deceive money
[42:28] is that saying the same thing right amen
[42:31] right okay let's go up now
[42:35] see it antichrist this there's your seal
[42:38] let's go a second i don't want to spend
[42:39] a whole lot of time on first four seals
[42:41] but i'm gonna spend a whole lot of time
[42:42] on the fifth six and seven not even the
[42:44] seventh you
[42:45] everybody knows what seventh seal is
[42:47] coming of the lord there's three parts
[42:49] to it coming of the lord
[42:50] an unknown tongue let me ask you when
[42:52] you were in pentecost somebody spoke in
[42:54] an unknown tongue who could interpret
[42:55] that
[42:56] only god amen now somebody in the
[42:59] audience would stand up with a gift of
[43:00] interpretation but really god can only
[43:02] interpret an unknown tongue

[43:09] all the way the coming lord all the way
[43:10] to the end of all things
[43:12] everybody understand does everybody
[43:14] understand when the white horse rider
[43:15] starts to ride
[43:17] when that rider when that rider got off
[43:19] the white horse onto the red horse the
[43:21] white horse kept going
[43:22] amen the antichrist is still here today
[43:25] do you agree
[43:26] did he stop when he got on the red horse
[43:28] the antichrist
[43:29] no no those so those writers write all
[43:31] the way to the end
[43:32] okay spirit antichrist is alive and well
[43:35] today okay
[43:36] now the second seal matthew 24 6
[43:38] revelation 6 3 and 4.
[43:40] now watch matthew 6 4 24
[43:43] 6. now let me see what it says all ye
[43:46] shall
[43:47] hear of wars and rumors of wars see that
[43:49] you be troubled not for all these things
[43:50] must come to pass but the end is not yet
[43:52] okay then brother branham here i
[43:55] corrected it brother rem said all right
[43:56] let's take the second seal revelation 3
[43:58] and 2.
[43:59] well you got to go three and four right
[44:02] see brother brown did make mistakes when
[44:04] he was talking everybody got that do we
[44:08] need a five-fold ministry to break it
[44:09] down for the people
[44:10] yeah people think we don't need a
[44:13] five-fold ministry anymore people don't
[44:15] think we got to go to church what do
[44:16] people think anymore
[44:18] i thought a christian went to church i
[44:20] thought the people said under a pastor
[44:23] i mean that's the unbeliever out there
[44:24] won't come to church and won't have a
[44:26] pastor
[44:27] people in this message think they don't
[44:29] have to come to church they sit at home
[44:31] listen to tapes
[44:32] and they think they don't have to have
[44:33] rapturing faith somebody some people ask
[44:35] me
[44:36] they call me me i'm a dummy why are they
[44:38] calling me it's like what are you
[44:39] calling me for
[44:40] they'll say well i'm going to this
[44:42] church and i got this pastor should i
[44:43] leave and go somewhere else
[44:45] you know what i always ask them does
[44:46] your pastor preach rapturing faith that
[44:48] stops them dead right there
[44:50] they'll go oh oh i thought well do you
[44:53] not know if they preach rapture in faith
[44:55] and i say do they preach yeah i said
[44:57] then you better stay there
[44:59] because about 10 of the message churches
[45:01] preach rapturing faith
[45:02] the rest of them are into emotion
[45:04] feeling and feeling good and i want to
[45:06] feel good
[45:07] but the stimulation of revelation is
[45:08] what makes me feel good
[45:10] you can sing a song like sound like the
[45:12] archangel by the way lucifer-led songs
[45:14] in heaven
[45:16] did you know that lucifer right
[45:19] he exalted himself above god he thought
[45:22] he was better than a preacher
[45:24] right we got news for him
[45:28] oh some of these message people need to
[45:30] get a revelation
[45:32] that's what we lack right so he opened
[45:34] it second beast what was it red horse
[45:37] okay let's go i want to keep i'm going
[45:39] to go through these fast you everybody
[45:41] in here know
[45:41] what four horses are right i'm gonna say
[45:44] it real quick rather than read it so i
[45:46] can get through it because i want to get
[45:47] to five
[45:47] first white horse and then god raised up
[45:50] a standard
[45:51] lion second the red horse god raised up
[45:53] a standard an ox
[45:54] does anybody know what a dog says a
[45:56] converted bull
[45:57] he's had the fight taken out of him you
[46:00] know what brother branham said i love
[46:02] this quote to me this quote makes a
[46:04] second seal as real to me he said he was
[46:07] talking about predestination
[46:08] he said why predestination is one of the
[46:11] oldest doctrines in the bible
[46:13] irenaeus preached that if you were
[46:16] predestinated and know where you stand
[46:18] with god
[46:19] does it matter if they tart and
[46:20] feathered you and burnt you would it
[46:22] matter if they hung you on a cross if
[46:23] you got predestination and you know
[46:25] you're going to make it to the other
[46:26] side
[46:26] they had the spirit of the ox on them
[46:28] for that age and they said
[46:30] got the fight taken out of me man kill
[46:32] this body and i'm gonna
[46:33] you're just sitting next before you
[46:35] blink i'm gonna be on the other side
[46:38] so they had their little red horse with
[46:39] their sword killing 68 million
[46:41] protestants
[46:42] didn't lose the one all that the father
[46:45] hath given me will come to me what is
[46:46] that predestination
[46:48] they had a revelation of predestination
[46:50] sam and they go here
[46:52] you know paul had him he said they're
[46:54] gonna chop my head off didn't even tie
[46:55] him up here
[46:57] just gave it up right he was ready to go
[46:59] he said i fought a good fight
[47:00] finished the course let me go so that's
[47:03] what it was
[47:04] okay god raises the standard then we
[47:05] come to the man what is man intelligence
[47:09] right what is the dark horse rider you
[47:11] remember three measures
[47:12] uh three pennies for a measure of barley
[47:14] it was all about money the catholic
[47:16] church was doing indulgences they
[47:18] trapped the entire money of the world
[47:22] those 68 million that were martyred you
[47:24] know where their farms and their money
[47:25] went to
[47:27] the catholic church
[47:30] everybody understand that very rich the
[47:33] black horse rider and what did it come
[47:35] up the intelligence of men
[47:36] under that we had luther we had wesley
[47:39] right
[47:39] so let me tell you something i said it
[47:41] last night your intelligence will take
[47:43] you a long way
[47:45] you ought to go read some of wesley's
[47:46] stuff
[47:48] knox finney dwight moody if you've never
[47:50] read some of those i have those were
[47:52] highly intelligent they were smarter
[47:53] than we were brother samuel
[47:55] you go and go take a test to iq they'd
[47:57] beat me hands down
[47:59] they had intelligence and it took them a
[48:01] long way
[48:02] but it took more than intelligence it
[48:04] took a revelation from
[48:06] god that's what we received in this
[48:08] prophet of this
[48:09] hour this elijah ministry the coming of
[48:11] the lord we got a revelation from god
[48:13] it's going to take you
[48:14] further than man's intelligence further
[48:16] than your intelligence will ever take
[48:18] you
[48:19] let's go up okay so then we have the
[48:22] next one's a pale horse
[48:23] the pale horse is the white red
[48:27] and black all mixed together

[48:47] message
[48:48] death if you denominate separate
[48:51] yourself from people
[48:52] shame on you you're supposed to have
[48:54] brotherly kindness you're supposed to
[48:55] draw the circle bigger
[48:59] i teach at our church you go to the old
[49:01] testament remember moab remember the
[49:03] children of israel were coming out
[49:05] and they went to the land of moab they
[49:07] went to the elders of jerusalem

[49:12] larp up you know what the moab said we
[49:14] want you
[49:15] out of here we don't like we're cousins
[49:18] and we don't like you

[49:22] folk
[49:24] loan somebody in your family uh money
[49:26] and see if you get it back
[49:28] i told the people at church if you're
[49:30] loaning the money to somebody you know
[49:32] plan on not getting it back
[49:34] and if you do fine yeah isn't that right

[52:02] the gentile dispensation and god saved 6
[52:05] million jews
[52:08] huh pretty interesting don't you think
[52:12] but now listen so he said this is for
[52:15] the people and for the jews
[52:17] everybody got why he said that that
[52:20] trapped it

[52:43] hour and because iniquity shall abound
[52:45] you know what iniquity is something you
[52:46] know to do and you don't
[52:48] amen iniquity and the love of many a wax
[52:51] cold doesn't it say in thessalonians
[52:53] that
[52:53] at that day the love of many will wax
[52:55] cold or more scripture says that than
[52:57] here
[52:58] right but i want you to key in on this

[53:14] endure the same shall be saved you know
[53:17] what that is that's to us
[53:20] if the fifth seal is only to the jews

[53:28] am the one and you're the one sitting
[53:29] here that's enduring till the end

[54:44] four days screamers i called them
[54:46] the neighbors thought my wife was
[54:48] beating me
[54:51] seriously i don't know if any of us
[54:52] anybody had a gallbladder attack in the
[54:53] air
[54:55] rough oh
[54:58] did it hurt well they took mine out too
[55:02] sister finally

[55:06] the hospital christmas and i've gained
[55:08] 30 pounds
[55:09] i was but i drink water and have an
[55:11] attack
[55:13] you know what i'll tell this i want to
[55:15] show you how this natural body is such a
[55:17] phenomenon and how you
[55:18] here are even far above that the doctor
[55:21] finally i i'd had a heart attack had a
[55:24] bad gall bladder they wouldn't take it
[55:25] out
[55:26] you got to wait a year those stents got
[55:27] to set a year we can't disturb them
[55:29] gall bladder attack all black next year
[55:32] okay
[55:33] i'm approaching the year sister peggy
[55:34] i'm going to get it out all is well
[55:36] another heart attack another year
[55:39] another heart attack
[55:40] another year finally i told the guys
[55:42] that i will i'll do anything to get this
[55:44] out
[55:45] i'll sign a waiver she said well you'll
[55:47] die if we do it while you're in the
[55:48] hospital i said i don't care
[55:51] i said would you get this i feel like i
[55:52] got something eaten from the inside out
[55:54] would you get this out i begged them
[55:56] nope we'll i'll wait three months waited
[55:58] three months and i got one surgeon that
[55:59] would do it
[56:00] nobody else wanted to he when he did
[56:02] that surgery he said my stomach and the
[56:04] rest of my organs were so swollen
[56:06] that they they wear your gallbladder
[56:07] they swole up and attach themselves to
[56:09] the gallbladder
[56:10] my gallbladder had been gangrene for no
[56:12] telling how long
[56:13] i should have died sister peggy he said
[56:17] your organs
[56:18] your organs were so swollen in your body
[56:20] they swell up
[56:21] and attach their self to you he said it
[56:23] took me 30 minutes to get your stomach
[56:25] off from your gallbladder they had to
[56:27] tear it off
[56:29] so your uncomely members when one is
[56:32] sick among you
[56:33] we get around them we'll forfeit ourself
[56:37] and we'll get around them if that would
[56:38] have leaked into my body that gangrene i
[56:40] would have died
[56:41] he said once i pulled everything away
[56:43] and got to your gall bladder
[56:44] he said it come out in pieces he said i
[56:47] grabbed it and he just fell off and he
[56:49] said like 10 pieces
[56:50] i said well how bad was he said the
[56:52] worst gallbladder i've ever seen in 10
[56:54] years
[56:55] worse see how good god is to us
[57:00] you think i didn't suffer a lot of days
[57:02] man oh
[57:04] it was and so now i've gained 30 pounds
[57:06] i'm going on a diet when i get home
[57:08] so you understand the fifth seal is an
[57:10] endurance thing it gives you the ability
[57:11] god has gifted you with something here
[57:14] he has given you grace in this church
[57:16] where you can endure where the other guy
[57:18] can
[57:18] when you've got guys sitting next to you
[57:20] in church falling away he's given you
[57:22] something
[57:22] he's given you grace by grace are you
[57:24] saved through faith
[57:26] and not of your own works
[57:29] now under that seal since it's to the
[57:32] people
[57:32] and of the jews right we understand that
[57:36] okay let's go up now i'm going to get
[57:38] the sixth seal and you go back and look
[57:40] at the fifth i'll cover this somebody
[57:42] was asking
[57:43] the sister about ezekiel the four living
[57:44] creatures do you understand
[57:46] i went and re-read the fifth seal all
[57:48] over in the sixth seal all over brother
[57:49] wade this way
[57:50] i studied more last week than i do at my
[57:52] church when i go out and preach it's
[57:54] harder on me than when i stay at home
[57:56] i don't have to do nearly the study you
[57:57] know what i mean but sam knows what
[57:59] that's like to go to another church
[58:01] man because you want to you want to be
[58:02] sure you're saying the right things you
[58:04] know
[58:05] but in the fifth seal brother branham
[58:07] explains this and he gets on the beast
[58:08] he said now the first seal
[58:10] the beast said come and see the lion the
[58:12] second one the beast said come and see
[58:14] the ox the next one the third come and
[58:17] see the man
[58:18] the next one come and see the eagle does
[58:21] everybody got that
[58:22] the fifth seal there is no living
[58:24] creatures announcing that
[58:26] it says he said this is
[58:29] christ that's going to reveal this to
[58:31] you by grace
[58:32] are you saved through faith the only way
[58:36] you're going to get this fifth seal
[58:37] is if god reveals it to you everybody
[58:40] got that
[58:41] the sixth seal not announced by a beast
[58:45] the seventh seal not announced by a
[58:47] beast
[58:49] is that right and i'm going to tell you
[58:50] something the four living creatures
[58:53] are the ministry amen the eagle is the
[58:57] ministry for this hour does everybody
[58:59] understand that
[59:00] the the lion was the ministry in paul's
[59:03] day
[59:04] they said in paul's day they got to look
[59:07] see that finger how messed up it is
[59:08] everything on my ain't got a good part
[59:10] on my body i can't donate if something
[59:12] you needed a part i couldn't give it to
[59:14] you
[59:15] don't look at me i can't give you a part
[59:18] okay
[59:18] i'm wore out so you know what the
[59:20] believers in paul's day did
[59:22] they put their finger on their nose
[59:23] brother and said you ain't saying what
[59:24] paul said is that a lion
[59:26] you know what a lion is
[59:30] type a personality just pounced right on
[59:32] them said hey you're not saying what
[59:34] paul said right
[59:36] so those four living creatures are the
[59:38] ministry that god has rose up in that
[59:41] hour

[1:00:53] now it's what jesus said in matthew 29
[1:00:58] 24 29 and 30.
[1:01:02] i didn't really catch the whole whole of
[1:01:05] this until i preached it here a while
[1:01:07] back
[1:01:07] and this excites me and what we're going
[1:01:09] to get into
[1:01:11] now remember everybody got your bibles
[1:01:14] if you got it go to 24 9 9 or 24
[1:01:17] 29 is everybody here the last time or
[1:01:19] not the last time time for i preached it
[1:01:21] back
[1:01:21] way back probably 2012 here about the
[1:01:23] age of aquarius
[1:01:26] you know i took this scripture and
[1:01:27] preached it out of it
[1:01:31] i want to bring it to you go back and
[1:01:32] listen to it or they don't get it posted
[1:01:34] that far back but you can get it if you
[1:01:35] want it and i'm going to cover that a
[1:01:36] little bit here in a minute under this
[1:01:38] seal
[1:01:38] okay immediately after the tribulation
[1:01:40] of those days what this tribulation this
[1:01:42] amateur tribulation that we've went
[1:01:44] through
[1:01:45] here what's he talking about the
[1:01:47] persecution of the 6 million jews that
[1:01:49] was an amateur tribulation
[1:01:52] you know what brother branham said
[1:01:53] another quote it's a type of tribulation
[1:01:55] does everybody understand what a type is
[1:01:57] it's a shadow of things to come
[1:01:59] those 6 million jews was a type of
[1:02:02] what's fixing to happen in tribulation
[1:02:05] will 144 000 be killed
[1:02:08] will the foolish virgins be killed will
[1:02:11] the earth be burnt over
[1:02:13] everybody get what i'm saying right okay
[1:02:18] but that's grace amen right brother
[1:02:22] that's grace right amen nothing but gray
[1:02:25] remember brother branson said that
[1:02:26] german guy had his it was in germany was
[1:02:29] talking about well they had six million
[1:02:30] that died in the
[1:02:31] in the uh dark ages he he said god was
[1:02:34] this old doty
[1:02:36] white-haired god sitting on a throne
[1:02:37] with his arms crossed around remember he
[1:02:38] said that
[1:02:39] and he said can you believe that god let
[1:02:41] 68 million people die
[1:02:44] yeah but were they all saved
[1:02:49] we don't know but if if if they were
[1:02:52] under that
[1:02:53] if they were predestinated they were
[1:02:55] saved right
[1:02:57] sure so it's just brother i'm saying
[1:02:59] it's the tender
[1:03:00] hand of jehovah he said the six million
[1:03:03] it died was a tender hand to jehovah
[1:03:06] kind of different what we think huh
[1:03:08] immediately half tribulation of those
[1:03:10] days that's eichmann and them the sun
[1:03:11] shall be darkening the moon
[1:03:13] does everybody remember how that we had
[1:03:15] how the sun was dark how the
[1:03:16] the church age pictures remember the the
[1:03:19] the moon was darkened
[1:03:21] to where it went into a total eclipse
[1:03:22] remember laodicea was totally dark
[1:03:25] do you know brother branham was allowed
[1:03:26] to write light in that
[1:03:28] do you know that laodicea was completely
[1:03:30] dark
[1:03:31] now let me ask you something i'm going
[1:03:32] to get this is a real big doctrinal
[1:03:34] thing
[1:03:35] do you think you're in laodicea
[1:03:40] you're in a bright age i don't call you
[1:03:43] church anymore
[1:03:44] brother i'll call you bride if you're in
[1:03:46] the church ages i got to call you church
[1:03:48] church ages everybody got it
[1:03:51] it was totally black why we ain't in the
[1:03:53] church ages no more
[1:03:55] i'm in the bright age people everybody
[1:03:58] understand that
[1:03:59] if you're in a church age you're under
[1:04:00] laodicea you're under a church
[1:04:03] uh somebody that's born of a woman is a
[1:04:07] how's it go he's in song proverb a man
[1:04:09] that's born of a woman it's a full day's
[1:04:11] and full of trouble
[1:04:12] if you're the church you're born of a
[1:04:15] woman you know
[1:04:16] i've talked to people in this message
[1:04:17] this is something that just gets on me
[1:04:18] quicker than anything
[1:04:20] i'll talk to somebody goes to a certain
[1:04:21] message and all they want to talk about
[1:04:23] their church
[1:04:24] their church their
[1:04:27] church i get off the phone and said did
[1:04:29] he even say one thing about christ
[1:04:32] are they born of a church or are you
[1:04:34] born of christ
[1:04:36] think about it you're not in the church
[1:04:39] age anymore you're not
[1:04:40] under the church you're a bright age
[1:04:42] you've had an invisible union with him
[1:04:45] you are so above the church now let me
[1:04:48] ask you something
[1:04:49] in a sixth seal does the church go
[1:04:51] through tribulation
[1:04:53] the church does does the bride go
[1:04:56] through tribulation
[1:04:59] let me tell you something you better get
[1:05:00] out of that church thing amen
[1:05:04] the church is your mama and she'll raise
[1:05:06] you to a certain age and then you got to
[1:05:08] get it on your own big boy
[1:05:10] you can't stay on the milk all the time
[1:05:12] mama will give you the milk
[1:05:13] but sooner or later you got to get it
[1:05:14] for yourself you better get into that
[1:05:17] bride age
[1:05:18] does everybody understand that brother
[1:05:20] branham said 120 coats were beyond
[1:05:22] pentecost what was the pentecostal age
[1:05:26] right see people want to take us back to
[1:05:29] pentecost
[1:05:31] you know i got a quote not having to
[1:05:33] hear i'm going to say it it's going to
[1:05:34] be a shocker
[1:05:35] brother said he didn't like the word
[1:05:36] pentecost
[1:05:38] he said pentecost was those people that
[1:05:40] were down there celebrating the 50.
[1:05:43] the ones in the upper room were
[1:05:44] apostolic it doesn't say in the bible
[1:05:47] he'll turn your heart back
[1:05:49] to the pentecostal fathers
[1:05:54] everybody in the message wants to turn
[1:05:55] you back to a pentecost all the hoopty
[1:05:57] do
[1:05:58] they're jumping up and down huh they're
[1:06:00] laying on the hands is that what they
[1:06:02] want
[1:06:02] prayer lines huh i'm not against that
[1:06:06] i want you to understand but that's not
[1:06:08] my emphasis
[1:06:10] my emphasis is christ the word
[1:06:13] your emphasis better be on this message
[1:06:15] on the word and you better get in it it
[1:06:17] better be in you
[1:06:18] and you better get in it okay
[1:06:22] time's running out people we are real
[1:06:26] close to the end of this thing

[1:06:31] i say seven church ages remember it was
[1:06:33] dark did did the moon go dark did we
[1:06:35] have an eclipse
[1:06:36] okay listen what it says uh the moon
[1:06:38] shall not give her light that's when it
[1:06:40] hap
[1:06:40] and the stars shall fall from heaven and
[1:06:42] the powers of heaven shall be shaken
[1:06:44] and then shall appear the sign of the
[1:06:47] son of man
[1:06:48] in heaven listen to this this is right
[1:06:51] here
[1:06:52] this is 30 is that right 29 was
[1:06:55] immediately after those days after the
[1:06:56] persecution of the jews
[1:06:58] this is when they appear the sign of the
[1:07:00] son of man amen
[1:07:01] now brother branham says this is the

[1:07:30] the best preachers i've ever heard in my
[1:07:31] life
[1:07:33] you guys have been so blessed here with
[1:07:36] this man
[1:07:37] [Applause]

[1:08:10] thinking the sixth seal is when it's
[1:08:13] there's two and it's it is that two
[1:08:16] so brother this is why he said it and i
[1:08:18] think it's a
[1:08:19] really good he said you won't go through
[1:08:21] tribulation but you will go through
[1:08:23] persecution

[1:08:28] that's what i'm telling you too do you
[1:08:30] know what the persecution is
[1:08:32] judgment you know what brother branham
[1:08:35] said
[1:08:36] education is of the devil is that
[1:08:37] judgment
[1:08:39] he said in 1956 he said in 1956 america
[1:08:42] you're getting your final jubilee
[1:08:44] in 1957 he said i don't pray for her
[1:08:46] anymore is that judgment
[1:08:49] he said politics is of the devil is that
[1:08:51] judgment
[1:08:52] i tried to tell our people and i
[1:08:53] preached and preached but stay out of
[1:08:55] that
[1:08:55] crazy stuff out there politics brother
[1:08:57] random sentence of the devil
[1:08:58] and i had people in my church saying
[1:09:00] well i'm i'm trump
[1:09:02] i'm for tr and a guy's been married
[1:09:03] three times and his wife's a
[1:09:05] ex-porno star did you know that
[1:09:09] would you you know what in our right
[1:09:11] mind would i vote for a guy like that
[1:09:14] is that the best we can produce in
[1:09:15] america you know what my answer is
[1:09:18] uh-huh shows were
[1:09:20] it's been judged a prophet or when you
[1:09:23] don't receive elijah the prophet he's a
[1:09:25] grace prophet brother ram said elijah
[1:09:27] prophets to the world he's a grace
[1:09:28] prophet
[1:09:29] when you refuse grace what do you have
[1:09:30] coming
[1:09:32] has america as a whole refused our
[1:09:35] prophet
[1:09:36] what do they what are we living in
[1:09:37] judgment this coveted 19 fallen is
[1:09:40] nothing but
[1:09:41] judgment brother branham said the flu of
[1:09:44] 1918 was a plague did you know he said
[1:09:47] that do you know covet 19
[1:09:49] is just another flu but it's a better
[1:09:51] bigger strain of it a new strain
[1:09:53] that's why they don't know how to fight
[1:09:55] it because we don't have a natural
[1:09:56] immunity to it or antibodies built up
[1:10:00] it's a plague following people now let
[1:10:02] me ask you something was israel in egypt
[1:10:04] when the things were starting to fall
[1:10:07] now if you die a coven 19 it doesn't
[1:10:09] mean that you're an egyptian
[1:10:11] it means your cadillac showed up and you
[1:10:13] just went over
[1:10:15] does everybody understand you gotta you
[1:10:17] gotta have a revelation with them
[1:10:19] you you know those heart attacks i never
[1:10:21] thought god was trying to kill me
[1:10:23] i never hollered out in the hospital one
[1:10:25] time when i had my gallbladder god are
[1:10:27] you trying to kill me
[1:10:29] i knew he wasn't trying to kill god
[1:10:30] don't want to kill me but you know what
[1:10:32] if i die
[1:10:34] it's my cadillac what is death to you
[1:10:38] i passed from death to life death
[1:10:41] you can no more die than god can die
[1:10:43] didn't brother brown say that
[1:10:45] what are you worried about death now
[1:10:47] i'll be honest with you
[1:10:49] i think you ought to go get a vaccine
[1:10:51] because there's no immunities to this
[1:10:52] one
[1:10:53] the flu we've had it in the world for
[1:10:55] 1918
[1:10:57] your mama had it you've had how many in
[1:10:59] here have had the flu
[1:11:00] hold up your hand every time you get it
[1:11:03] your
[1:11:03] build up antibodies against it and it's
[1:11:06] harder to get
[1:11:07] this rascals a new strain of it and your
[1:11:10] body has no immunity to it
[1:11:13] 95 of the people that get the vaccine if
[1:11:16] they get it
[1:11:17] they don't have it as bad sister peggy
[1:11:20] you know what i did i haven't taken a
[1:11:21] flu shot in 20 years and i haven't had
[1:11:23] the flu
[1:11:24] i went and got this rascal i thought uh
[1:11:26] uh buddy
[1:11:27] you know why in 11 22 my song leader
[1:11:30] died a miserable death
[1:11:32] he got blood clots and i've never heard
[1:11:34] anybody yet that got blood clots with
[1:11:36] this government that lived
[1:11:37] not one this is tough people
[1:11:41] this is tough god gave you a coconut use
[1:11:44] it
[1:11:44] what i tell our people your intellect
[1:11:47] will go a long way
[1:11:49] right this head that god gave you will
[1:11:52] go
[1:11:53] way up the ladder and where it can't
[1:11:55] take your revelational finishing
[1:11:58] so god gave me a coconut up here and he
[1:12:00] kind of expects me to use it
[1:12:02] right huh okay
[1:12:06] if you don't get the vaccine that's your
[1:12:07] deal i'm not trying to tell you to or
[1:12:09] not too but

[1:13:04] moon until here recently
[1:13:06] i went out and looked up what is a blood
[1:13:08] moon you want me to tell you
[1:13:10] remember jesus when his his sweat looked
[1:13:12] as like blood
[1:13:13] you know what that was a blood moon
[1:13:17] did anybody know that that was a blood
[1:13:20] moon
[1:13:20] he was standing there he had prayed and
[1:13:23] he got sweaty
[1:13:24] and that red that blood moon was shining
[1:13:26] it looked like he said he's
[1:13:27] appeared as blood he didn't say it was
[1:13:30] blood
[1:13:31] you're pulling that's why i'm looking at
[1:13:32] you okay everybody else is too but
[1:13:34] you're pulling
[1:13:35] okay that's the way it happens with me
[1:13:37] blood moon does everybody understand
[1:13:39] that we're having all these blood
[1:13:40] you know what blood moon means in the in
[1:13:42] the time of isabella and king ferdinand
[1:13:44] and spain in 1492
[1:13:46] or 52 someday they had a blood moon you
[1:13:48] know what happened right after that
[1:13:49] they said the jews couldn't be in spain
[1:13:51] anymore they told them to pack their
[1:13:53] luggage they took them out on ships they
[1:13:54] dumped
[1:13:55] they kept their luggage and killed them
[1:13:57] and dumped them in the ocean
[1:13:59] you know what hitler did pack your
[1:14:01] luggage jews we're going to relocate you
[1:14:04] just exactly what king ferdinand and
[1:14:07] isabella was telling them in spain
[1:14:09] they packed their luggage does anybody
[1:14:10] know a jew they ain't gonna be far from
[1:14:12] their money brother sam
[1:14:14] they had it no luggage right so when
[1:14:17] they got to the track before they gassed
[1:14:19] them they threw their luggage over here
[1:14:21] they had people going through it right
[1:14:23] and they took them to the ovens the same
[1:14:25] thing that happened blood moons when you
[1:14:27] see a blood moon
[1:14:28] innocent blood is going to be shed the
[1:14:30] blood moon when jesus prayed let this
[1:14:32] cat cut past
[1:14:33] was innocent blood shed and king
[1:14:35] ferdinand was innocent bloodshed
[1:14:37] every time you see a blood moon it's an

[1:37:55] same thing so just like the gospels just

[1:38:29] and we love you too amen the only person
[1:38:32] we want
[1:38:32] to be uncomfortable is who the devil we
[1:38:34] want the devil to be uncomfortable
[1:38:36] amen so that's our job is to defeat the
[1:38:39] devil so let's bow our heads
[1:38:41] to heavenly father we pray lord today
[1:38:43] that
[1:38:44] as our brother was speaking we were
[1:38:46] thinking lord back
[1:38:48] to when we first come to the lord and
[1:38:52] a lot of these things were maybe foreign
[1:38:56] in our mind and we were just a young
[1:38:58] christian and we had heard it maybe many
[1:39:00] times before at
[1:39:01] younger age but lord when the new birth
[1:39:04] comes it
[1:39:05] it it just paints a picture that that
[1:39:07] man cannot
[1:39:08] paint it puts things together
[1:39:12] and as the prophet said it may be the
[1:39:14] cow and the top of the tree eating grass
[1:39:16] but
[1:39:16] all of a sudden the picture becomes
[1:39:19] clear and we have the cow
[1:39:20] eating the grass on the ground and we
[1:39:23] see the picture lord
[1:39:25] it gets more clear as we go further
[1:39:28] through the message of the hour
[1:39:30] and we thank you for that lord i hope we
[1:39:32] all
[1:39:33] in this building and we all started as
[1:39:35] young christians and
[1:39:37] some are young christians now that maybe
[1:39:39] not understood everything that was going
[1:39:40] on but
[1:39:41] you said you would lead and guide us
[1:39:43] into all truth yes
[1:39:44] so i believe we heard the truth today
[1:39:46] lord so i pray lord that if it be anyone
[1:39:48] that has a question
[1:39:50] that lord in the stillness of the night
[1:39:52] or the next time
[1:39:53] someone preaches or we've heard many
[1:39:55] times before
[1:39:56] someone say something about a sermon
[1:39:58] that was preached three months ago that
[1:40:00] they got something out of so
[1:40:01] lord that's the way you work you're
[1:40:04] almighty god and you know what we need
[1:40:06] we're your children but you did require
[1:40:09] us to grow up
[1:40:11] and be adults and quit screaming daddy
[1:40:14] daddy
[1:40:15] but lord take this message and take it
[1:40:17] to a dying world
[1:40:19] and go up that statue of a perfect man
[1:40:21] together lord as the bride of jesus
[1:40:23] christ in the end time
[1:40:24] thank you for this day that you give us
[1:40:26] lord as we go and eat a natural meal and
[1:40:28] come back at two o'clock
[1:40:30] we pray that you would just be with each
[1:40:31] one of us lord and help us
[1:40:33] lead us and guide us into all truth be
[1:40:35] with sister chichi again and brother
[1:40:37] royal that we'll hear a good report
[1:40:38] father that's that's coming from there
[1:40:40] in the philippines we know they're

[1:40:42] horrible time there lord i pray lord

[1:40:46] you'll sanctify us though for our
[1:40:48] journey and cleanse us from all
[1:40:50] unrighteousness when we ask these things
[1:40:51] in the name of jesus christ
