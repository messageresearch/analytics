so remember them too and uh brother Danny and brother Gary and I going to try to go a little fishing some maybe take a little bit of time off but not gone for the weekend we'll be back so we'll we're just leaving Thursday and coming back Saturday but I wanton have to be studying for the service and everything all right but just pray that the Lord would bless and be with each one of us let's go into our scripture let's go to Hebrews 10 we're going to go to Hebrews 10 and verse 38 and then we'll read on through Hebrews 11:3 then we'll go to habca 2 so these will be the scriptures that we'll be dealing with so let's just pray father we thank you for this opportunity that we have today that we can come together we had a good time this morning and listen to our brother talk about you and Lord now this afternoon we come to a time that we desire to sit down and listen for a little while and fellowship Lord around Thy word and let your love and grace be with each one of us we love you and we thank you bless all the ones that have been traveling and all today and just be with each one be with those that are away bless each one and guide each and every one of us we love you we thank you keep us now in Jesus name amen now drop back up because of a specific point that I want to bring out and if you'll notice I like the way the brother said this morning about the Bible being a you know continuance continuance it's not just it was cut up and put into uh uh you know what we call verses and things like that by mankind and sometimes they put it the best they could comprehend as to subject matter you know but yet they don't follow the Revelation continually uh you know the way that I look at it sometimes now I don't believe it's like my grandmother my wife's uh grandmother uh and my mother used to write that way too but my wife's grandmother she'd write you a letter and she'd tell you what happened here and what happened there what went on here and what went on there never a perod a question mark or anything you just had to figure out where you stopped and started well that's pretty well way the Bible is and it's really written backwards so that really does confuse us but you know we just we love it anyway love the word look what it says now as a background for Hebrews 11 I could go back all the way through the whole thing but we don't want to do that I just want you to see the background Paul is laying before he says faith is the substance and look at his background now there just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back unto predition but of them that believe to the saving of the Soul now Faith is the substance of things hope far the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now I like we'll get to habac just a second I like to think on the scriptures because if you get in Hebrews 11 you'll find that the word by is used like 15 times by Faith by Faith by faith but if you'll notice when we got down to verse three it says through faith we understand that means a continuation of something true it takes it time and then you get over to verse 12 and it says you know through faith sah conceived in other words true means you're traveling through something by is simply stating a point that this is what it is by this all right now we know that it's used in Romans that just shall live by faith it's used in Galatians but each one one of them is stated the same way as to say the just shall live by faith all right now I wish you would go to habca with me this one verse and they can pull it back up and look what it says here behold his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him that's human beings look but the judge shall live by his faith all right now first off that's stating that just shall live by his faith God's faith all right now hold that main thing cuz that's what it is but then a Man Too is living by his own faith and remember what we're talking about trying to have a positive attitude to look at the word and remember the point we're trying to say that see you you have the biggest portion of your faith the prophet says Blasphemous names is what mental Faith oh we like to think we got super duper super duper Faith right but he said the biggest portion of our faith is mental Faith that's taken from paragraph 142 3 4 5 6 of blasphemia name but he said when the when God comes down see mental faith comes by the word of God right anything you get comes by the word of God faith mental Faith you don't get Holy Ghost faith it just drops in you and oh bless I ain't even never read nothing but I got a great Revelation yeah you got one all right but see everything's based on God's word all right but as I said now to take habca he is stipulating that it's by his faith all right now first your faith is just a mental concept so it's right in using that relating to the just shall live by his faith you all right but then it goes into the point of living by God's faith all right because as we said there on Blasphemous night when the Holy Ghost comes down through your mental Faith the prophet said it'll make it a spiritual Revelation all right so now what have we been talking about Hebrews 113 we read there that it says faith cometh by hearing what 11 10 and then we drop down to 11 that it's defining more of what he's talking about in verse 10 or chapter 10 that faith is the substance all right now remember last week when we were talking about it we're talking about a substance we'll call this substance faith it kind of get a title from it but if you're me Faith it's a wonderful thing don't lose it because it it it doesn't come spiritual faith it comes mental Faith by hearing the word and then that mental Faith by hearing the word becomes a spiritual Revelation when the Holy Ghost quickens it to you or as we'll get to it later on down in the message when it becomes a revelation to you amen all right but now you think of about which comes first then see faith has to come before anything can be an actual substance all right so our life service we went through speaking about how that God before the world back in his mind he had thoughts of what he wanted to do and then he be to transmit that down and we're talking about that being the f fa there and then he begin to transmit downward and it goes from that point of Faith or God to being the word that he can say Let There be right all right see then it's becoming more to more toward an actual substance but remember he had to speak it the word had had to say it before it become world you know the world was created this was created that was created but before then it was a substance but we couldn't find it you can't show it to somebody cuz Faith is something you can't show nobody else right you alone have it all right now if it's right in our reading then faith is the substance of things hop for so whatever you're hoping for if it's revealed to you you already have the substance right but yet you can't show it to nobody Abraham had a baby but even Sarah couldn't find it right she didn't believe it right she couldn't see it but he saw it am all right now I wonder how many times you've looked up things to just think about it how many times don't raise your hand now but some of you may already know but how many times you think the word faith is used in the Old Testament many ask what times do you think the word faith is used in the old test what' you say sister Gail two times faith is not an Old Testament word right now not meaning they didn't have faith all right meaning that it was not in its Purity to where that it would relate to the word faith all right not meaning they didn't have faith I hope you understand what I'm getting at right but it was called to Abraham it was called believing to uh job it was called I know uh you know a lot of those things were used back there that are different words to Able it was revealed right which would be a better word wouldn't it right it was actually revealed to abble well I believe it was revealed to Abraham don't you right and I believe it was revealed to job but the word faith is not there it's only used the two times that's in the scripture we just read where it talks about but to just shall live by his faith Deuteronomy 32:21 says children in whom is no faith all right it's a new testament word to my way of saying it and that's just my terminology it's something that's real all right now it was real to Abraham okay right 25 years he waited pretty real but yet that word believed or believe is not as strong as the word faith right to say I know it's not as strong you know why because they did not have the faith of God inside of them as a new birth right are you with me right the Old Testament saint never had the new birth amen you couldn't have the new birth until Christ came right right because the Bible said because the Holy Ghost is not been given because Jesus not been glorified people look at the Old Testament you say them people in the Old Testament were not born again boy they just they get all huffy with you about it thinking they had some great Revelation but just remember you cannot have the new birth until Christ come to die that was the thing that would bring a substance within the man amen whereas uh Abraham he would have that believing that anchored and that God could speak to him but yet may I quote the prophet if under the blood of bulls and goats you could have flies fleas and frogs he said why would we stumble at the blood of Jesus Christ what is he meaning he's meaning the capability of bringing anything to being or it's a stronger way of saying it today amen all right Abraham believed God but it never brought him a new birth right it brought a child right right amen because see you you you can't have it back there that's the point you have to look at it but those people back there they had to have a positive attitude you know they thought positive and seemingly sometimes they were more positive than we are that claim the new birth right but see we're we're getting all mixed up in what faith is I've ask you this question each service have you ever had God to reveal something to you that you knew beyond any shadow of a doubt it was coming to pass or had already come to pass or whatever you ever had that if you haven't then you don't know what I'm talking about because you've never experienced it right well a lot of our faith then the prophet said is mental Faith now he says about Christians taken from fellowship by Redemption he said but once faith when but when Once the faith comes down into the compartment down here you know what he's talking about from the head down the heart what happens there's the reason people doesn't get where they should be it becomes a mental concept of God now come down with me by you believing him by an intellectual Faith but that won't do it it's got to be a born again experience where your faith is brought down into this compartment here and no matter what it looks like faith says it so anyhow right now remember what we've been dealing with though we've been dealing with the point of saying that you can be sick today right and be healed of that and die tomorrow with the same thing well you just didn't get it no what your Prophet said you did so you argue with him you know and he said in explaining it he said Peter had had a substance He Walked on Water perfect Faith but he said he lost his substance right he began to fall right we said he held his profession all right you remember he looks up he's sinking down I don't believe he goes you know I believe he just starts sinking his way and he looks up and he says Lord help me he still had a great confession because he realized that was the only help he had or hope he had so he kept his profession and you know what his profession walked him back in the boat but he had lost his substance all right so it's possible now to be healed and lose the substance right you go back to a mental statement but it's impossible now to be born again and lose the substance of your salvation now you can be at justification you can be at sanctification and you can lose that substance part that you have and you can lose that salvation but there's no way to lose the new birth right amen you know is no way but now remember the difference why we use and then Faith becomes a new testament word is because those Old Testament people never had that new birth right no now I'll get to it when we get back on to it brother Brandon was talking about the woman that touched the him of His Garment and he says she had faith for that time right and she could be here healed he said the disciples were casting out Devils we know that's in the Bible right but when they come to that epileptic child they couldn't cast it out he said see they didn't have perfect Faith he said because it's hard to have perfect faith without the Holy Ghost right he said because it brings it right all right but now remember the point we getting that faith is the substance now it doesn't say faith might be a substance could be a substance that goes into the words hope but it says faith is the substance well now to God and remember backing up where he was and then he CES to sins and then and he speaks it and the world comes into being but remember the world in the mind of God was just as real as the substance that came I peed on the pull pit to make the point to what you're talking about something hard see the world that was spoken into existence was in his mind all right now in his mind that faith is what it is the certain of things was just that Faith transmitted down to become a substance as we call it all right see then faith is the substance okay of whatever you're asking for but see we don't believe it that way we we believe it in a mental concept we say I'm Healed right and we have a good confession but sight and time what the prophet say God's worst enemies all right so let it go a little while and after a while you begin to deteriorate in your faith see then you'll say well I I need to go to the doctor I guess well I don't see no reason why you should went to start with unless God tells you now if he tells you don't worry about it but see there's our propped up super duper thing now remember keep the point in mind everybody awaking up keep the point in mind salvation can't be lost truly Born Again experience can't be lost amen you receive the person of Jesus Christ in the New Birth you you can't lose that you remember the man on the Hebrew series that was a preacher just quit preaching went out and got in some beer and sat down and said I ain't going to preach no more it wasn't long he is gone the prophet said God couldn't let him Mar his name he took his child home but in healings and things we can have it and lose it have it and lose it H that's why the problem is that we look at healing like this say you're healed of a of a bad headache or something well a few weeks later you have a hurting in your leg you know and our doings most of the time is to say I got healed of the headache I'm Healed of this uh-uh you got to come back again you don't get it because you got it before healing is not based on that basis healing is based on an individual now don't get me wrong that's good faith Builder that's good faith Builder to realize you was healed but that don't heal you right we'll get down in a little while where the Prophet was talking about if I had the quarter I got the bread but remember the quarters is not the substance we got that wrote down too the quarter is not the substance it's only the purchasing power we're talking about a substance and Webster says substance is what anything consist of but it's in a material matter or Etc I gave them to you the other day physical matter or material that's what Webster says about substance something that has a separate or independent existence all right it's something real in your strong concordance 5287 that which has actual existence real being Foundation subst structive or structure it actually means a person that's what the word substance comes out to be from strong concordance all right now remember which one comes first faith has got to be there before the substance will ever come into being right all right and see once the once it comes into being to an actual substance now once it come to this now listen to what I'm saying this is not substance you say what is it it's an oak tree it's an actual fact the dirt you stand on the car you drove up here with is not a substance that's an actual fact you don't have to have faith for a shirt on today do you I don't see any men in here without any amen that's an actual fact and see that's why it's so easy for us to think yes I believe I'm Healed but now when I'm delivered I'll confess it actually you're saying when I get it I'll tell everybody I got it and our big super duper what's my favorite saying our big super duper thing is you you need to confess you're healed yeah but I'm not healed and if I say I'm Healed and I'm not healed I'm a line huh you don't never have that to come in your mind when God delivers me I'll say I'm Healed well you can never be healed and can never be saved because mental faith is not a substance mental faith is not a substance it's a hope it's a believing a wish no matter then who it is that's why a sinner can receive healing brother brother said have prostitutes cross the platform and be healed real genuine Saints cross the platform and not receive their healing you remember that but you know what you take that prostitute and you do like brother randam did one day in a prayer line he said little girl and the mother came and he said now ain't you ashamed to come up here to want to be healed when you're lost said you to accept Jesus Christ first and he said they accepted Jesus Christ and he said you know what happened they was healed right or the little girl was but you see that's the way we do it we make it we're so super duper religious until we totally deny the word of God you got to say you're healed before you can be healed you got to say you're saved before you can be saved it ain't something falling out of Heaven it just flops along you know but when it comes have you ever heard the prophet say this he said faith is very simple faith is very simple you know what the prophet said he first does it then he reveals it and then he makes it manifest you remember those all right even in Salvation Romans says confess with your mouth believe in your heart shall be saved but see we get up and we say I said it I believe it so I got it well you know somebody might have done that and received it because I'm as honest as I can say to you I've been healed of a many of thing you know that from high blood pressure to eyes that couldn't see to my blood type totally changed from a positive a negative medically proven you want to talk to these nurses about what they'll tell you if you say that stupid can't be done only your records prove it but you know every time God's ever touched me that way he didn't holler and scream at me and explain it to me he just simply took care of it right right yes sir that's why we're looking for Faith to be something great you know some kind of a marvelous thing that happens and we feel it we emotionally you know are elated we we do many things and those things are wonderful but may I quote the prophet he said if you need them things God will let you have them but he said you're not supposed to have do it that way he said you're supposed to believe what the word says Brother D you don't believe in being emotional I just explained it I believe in being emotional because of what God has already done amen I'm not going to shout my way into being healed if I can do that I don't need Jesus at Calvary I didn't need his stripes I could shake myself into it see what does it mean to you when you actually read that faith is the substance what does it actually mean to you see if you ever really see what it is you'll realize why the prophet would say faith is more real than anything you can see taste f smell or here it's more real it's a substance and a substance is what anything consist of you remember the one we gave the other day I won't get back over to it but where the Prophet said where it said and the evidence of Things Not Seen he says now if it's an Evidence it's got to be a substance first right when it sickens me I know I'm old Dy granddaddy I'm sorry and I don't mean this wrong I always just say what I mean and mean what I say and forget it but you have a wreck happen out here on the highway and two hours later they get the news media out there you know and they're view viewing and taking pictures of the car and that and then they want somebody to tell them what happened I'll leave out them other words where I talk about the fat lady is generally the one that does it but I'll go on to the other but you know what I'm talking about the truth the loudmouth person in the crowd that wasn't there showed up 5 minutes before the news crew got there but they tell them all about what happened at the wck right am I true you go to court with that what does the court say I many of you ever said on jury here says no evidence they say did you see the wreck no go sit down shut up but I tell you I saw this shut up cuz you don't know what's going on see if it's an Evidence an Evidence is a fact that can be proven you want the Webster's Dictionary on that one an Evidence is something that can be proven you witnessed the wreck then you can put that in the testimony right see how many of us is actually witnessed in her own experience come on yes and mainly where does experience change people come on you said boy when I come into the message I quit cutting my hair I quit painting my face I quit wearing them clothes I quit but I was born again 10 years before then something's wrong right amen somewhere I thought the new birth was to bring a new life right a new doings right I didn't have to quit smoking when I come in this message I didn't have to quit drinking why because I didn't do it before I came in the message well brother D you just like to be different go GL praise God I'm Different what's the matter with you you mean you got to to be told it's wrong by a prophet when the word of God says don't do it that's right I mean was it all right to commit adultery run around with women and do all kind of garbage but when I heard the message I had to quit but I was born again see those things going into our mental faith brother R said you can't get a holy ghost fied woman to put on a PR of pants now you go do what you want to with that he didn't say he said it he said you can't get it done well brother D I done it well then yeah you're the one admitted your loss not me right yeah but I don't like it that's what it is you don't like for me to be blunt what can't we be blunt amen you'll never get nowhere trying to to figure out what faith is by being diddle doly and play around and well yeah boy I believe that I believe that the times God has healed me I simply just confess my way into it and walk right toward it and all at once it was gone I wore glasses for eight years couldn't shoot a gun because the iron sights fuzzed on and to go to a look out and everything was wavy I wore glasses to take care of that one day I came right here and I said and on the way I said God you know I'll use my eyes for you and I read and I study would you just please take it away I had a church to pray for him he went to the ey doctor and he said what are you doing wearing glces been wearing for eight years why he said you got 2020 you know what I went in there fuzzy and couldn't tell what everything was I came out of there seeing as clear as a crystal and you see me reading this print 74 years old and can still read Bible print under a good light situation I use glasses to read why cuz you get a headache if you don't but what's my point my point is we want to make some super duper thing to happen and if something super duper happens we believe it w't you just walk right into it brother col's wife there years ago they had to take her ptary every how you pronounce that big old word gland out back here they take it out which means you're automatically a diabetic right because there just nothing to that gland is what produces she got to get in being sick go we done told her said and they gave her the medicine we told her simple little illustration I said just sanctify that medicine before you take it how many of you sanctify your medicine before you take it in our medicine cabinet there's a prayer cloth in case I forget ask to sanctify the medicine amen so sister Ruth goes to the doctor got her because she was sick and the doctor saids for some reason your body is supplying insulin just don't take no more well you know you ever heard r r make this statement he said God draws millions of gallons of water out of the ocean every day and don't make one bit of sound right but yet we think it's got to be super duper oh yes just something great happens if I saw a vision Brother D I believe I was healed the devil can give you one now what are you going to do with that right yeah if you'll pray for me brother Dale and I feel cold chills run all over me I'll be healed well that's only going to set you up for the next time because it may happen that time and the next time when you really need it right and when you really need it it won't come why because you're dependent on a sensation but listen faith is the substance it's an actual substance you just I'm going read from Brother you just can't show it to nobody else show me one God show me one God you can't do it you actually got to believe something that science says is impossible but the Bible said he that cometh to God must believe what that he is not was or maybe will be he is right a positive attitude will always come from things that are present tense you remember Moses mama told him his deliver all he heard all of his life got him must stinking dead Egyptian and run out of the the country for five minutes at a burning bush he walked out of there ready to go take over in Egypt and he did a lot of difference in just a confession but but we must confess right right brother the gir's daddy would tell you what 50 or 80% or something he was a doctor about 80 90% of the people get well they told them when they started Medical School said the biggest portion of people will get well if you don't hinder them and he said I try to get people to believe like I explained the other day you go in and they got this new medicine we want you to try this new medicine you you got this cancer you got that once you try this new medicine we've been using it for a year or two now only had one patient that was healed we've had 10,000 died you're not going to take that medicine and the idiot that was trying to sell it to you order to know better but if you go in there this product 95% delivery rate from this product you're willing to train take a change ain't you you know what he's trying to do touch your mental capacity of your being like I've always said the boy that broke the 4-minute mile was an invalid That was supposed to have never been able to walk but you know what they forgot to tell him that's you know they forgot to tell the Bumblebee that it can't fly but scientifically it cannot fly but you know does every day but see faith is the substance now what you're asking for is not in the substance after you get it that's a fact it's in asking God when you have nothing to show sure if he better that's good but what if you get worse there's where we lose it right I was prayed for but I got worse well what did the prophet say the greatest sign that you're healed is you get sicker we don't want to quote that but you understand what I mean my nephew was laying in the hospital with roast what do you call it multiple it ftic but it was in the lungs which means they fill totally up one of them finally rung up they done a double lung transplant on him and he's doing wonderful thank God but you know what when he was a little bitty fell they gave him up I saw a brother Ben Howard up at Gainesville I said where you going Ben he said I'm going down here to pray for somebody I said I said come on I said we're going to pray for my nephew they done give up and told him it was nothing they could do we walked in the room didn't spend no big a lot amount of time simply turned around prayed a prayor walked out of the room you know what that's about 30 something years ago I guess 40 he's still alive but see we don't think about faith as being simple if we got something to to link it to but that's not what the Bible say right the Bible doesn't say substance is something you link your things to and then it becomes Faith no no come on it I know where the Prophet said if you got something that that's a scientific fact I don't have to ask for a shirt I've got one on but when you got to stand there without any form of real evidence that you can show anybody else but stand there and say by Stripes I'm Healed you see a lot of people have never done that so they don't really know what faith is I'm just going to make mistake to forget it then I wonder what they're linking their salvation to if you're linking your your healing to a mental concept that if you can feel better you'll say you're healed then if you you're a sinner and you say well if I quit sinning I'll figure out I'm a Christian and that's actually what you're saying right I thought we believed in Deliverance I didn't know we believed in quitting or sieling out something you know make it it's easy to believe when you prayed far and think starts happening to the good but when they start happening to the bad right what are you going to do but see you're not getting the scripture faith is the substance of the things you hope for so whatever you want faith is the substance of that see now you've gone back beyond the natural so you're going to beond the natural thing because it's easy to have a to have a substance in claim I've got a substance but wasn't it something with Abraham 25 years you know Abraham means High father right everybody comes up to him and say high father how many kids you got don't have any well you're lying cuz your name says your father is that back to what we talking about a while ago I I I don't want to lie now but because I I I'm I'm not a liar and and and I'm not going to say I'm Healed until I am well don't worry about you ain't going to never be healed you're a liar when you won't say it cuz the Bible says you're healed amen there Abraham one day God met up with him again again again right and one day he changed his name from Abram to Abraham which Abram means High Father Abraham means father of Nations you're how you doing Abram my name's been changed oh what happened when a been changed Abraham oh father of Nations that means you got a bunch of kids you know back then polygamy was illegal and he could probably had about 10 one year he still didn't have a thing in the world right and God done changed his name and made him father of Nations well you know what he got a hold of something that was real right that's what I mean by asking the question have you ever had an experience right right what are you basing your salvation on what is your experience well I come into the message I believe God sent a prophet devil doesn't beat you to it that's right he does all them what is your evidence something that you can prove prove I don't have to prove to you I'm saved bless God well I know you're not then if you start out that yak it Yak but you see faith it says is the substance if you got faith you already got it that's where our problem's at we try to work our way up into getting it if you got faith you've already got it it's an actual substance but see Peter had a good substance but he lost it you cannot be healed the prophet said by mental faith it won't heal you don't do away with it CU you got to start somewhere but you can't be saved by mental Faith it's got to turn out to be his Revelation his faith right that's why I hope you understand what I meant that that word faith is not in the Old Testament those but those two times well because they didn't have the new birth experience to be able to say the life that I now live by the faith I live by the faith of God they couldn't say that as Paul could but what about it see substance is what you desire right you want to see it hear it feel it smell it but faith is something that you don't see taste feel smell or here so now why would you want to feel it why would you want to say when I feel better I'll say I'm Healed don't worry about it go and die put your salvation on it like that when I feel good I'll say I'm saved if I don't feel good today I'll say I'm not saved today well you know what you going to do but did you ever just thought about it I know you have mentally but have you ever asked God to reveal it to you cuz brother around said we need a revelation more than anything you know you can't be saved without a revelation what about the man that told brother brandom he didn't believe in Revelation what about the people of this message they believe brother brandham had to Revelation that's why I'm saved right to believe this message is not Faith to how this message revealed is Faith right that's right right Amen to believe it you just have a hope can somebody come along with a trinity Doctrine now and talk you out of the one God deprogram you as they call it today well why don't we get serious folks see it's Faith now think about what I'm saying it's Faith before it can become a sub I don't get nothing else will this stay right here faith is whatever substance you're Desiring Faith well I believe God brother T you trying to tell me I ain't a Believer no I'm trying to just get you and I to one thing the prophet said it's time to rub out all this middle hoop looop stuff that we think we got so much of and settle down and believe God Amen they put a gun to your head you'll find out whether you got faith or not that's right right it won't be no deprogramming then all you got to do is just say I don't believe that then you just keep your head where we going to fit in all of those back in the ages see faith has to come first don't even talk about a substance don't talk about healing until it's revealed to you pray for it to be revealed to you how many of you ever I'm honest how many of you have ever simply you're sick you have problem problems have you ever simply just prayed God would you reveal to me that I'm Healed I mean just seriously mean it Lord let me get away from all this hoopla that I've got CU it evidently ain't working reveal to me that I'm Healed that's right but see that's what we want to Super right I walked in the doctor's office that day with my kneecap and he showed me through the x-rays and thing let his War slap out I like the old guy he was my kind of a guy old country guy he comes walking in paint on his shoes and everything in the world I look at him I that's my doctor there he said Sam said you KN out wor slap out and here x-rays Etc he said we'll just stop take it off we see that was back when you stayed Peg Leg you know they didn't have all this super duper stuff that they do now just took your cap off and used his Peg Leg to rest of your life and and I didn't think it over and didn't scream and holler at him or anything I said Doctor I've got an irritated kneecap he said you got a wore out kneecap and I'll take it off I said you will never take my kneecap off it's irritated get me off of my feet for a few days and I'll prove it to you doc he said I won't do it he said because you got crippling arthritis and said you get off of your feet for a time and you'll never move again that's well you ain't going to take me cap off that's life walked out of the office he like life back at me he said I see you s well I still got my knck out and he's dead and gone on but I went back to my regular doctor you know that was a specialist Orthopedics what you call those big words you know a guy with the paperwork you know don't mean he knows anymore he just got paperwork I went back to regular doctor and he said I told I said get me off my knee my feet for give me a 3 or 4 days doctor and I'll prove to you that it is nothing nothing wrong he said Sam that's a specialist and said you went to him to learn I said yeah but he's wrong I said my KN out's just irritated I bummed him up crawling up under a house working and I said get me off my feet for a while he said I'll give you two days he said if it if he's right he said if you got crippling arthritis he said you can't afford to sit down I said doc I know all about about that but I it's not it well I still got my knap you know now they'll come along after 40 years and they come along and they'll hurt devil says see there they going to take in a knap off I said well I got 40 years I've been enjoying it now they got it up where I can get me one mobile you know they even got them now it's got the machines on it you know I watched my wife when she was going through hers you know put on that thing that d straighten the leg and pull it back out I said man if I get me one of them just installed I could walk good you know right yeah but do you understand what I'm getting at Faith is not imagination it's not a myth I'm looking at the quotes from the prophet he said you actually possess it but you can't show it to no nobody else substance that's why a person right over here can be healed more healings per buildings of what we would call the people outside of the message one more healings with them than they are with us right you know why they can do it because they're not cond DED you stop as I said that woman that was a prostitute and you tell her ain't you ashamed coming up here in this church and you being a prostitute she ain't going to get healed cuz you just blocked her mentals part of her see faith is the substance the Bible says it's his faith his faith it goes all the way back to him that's why the Bible says when you're brought to the FL do what did it say take no thought for what you're to say said it will be given to you at that time well we going to court I got this figured out because and I know they're going to say this and I'm going to say that they're going to say this I'm going to say that you just wasted today why don't you go take a nap course it ain't going to be that way anyway you get in there and they're going to trick you and trap you and everything in the book right but you see church if you've ever experienced something most people have never seen God in a ways that brother said some are chosen to see it to where they can explain to others and they can't talk about seeing God it's just mental it's just being good going to church believing God sent a prophet trying to live right and do right that's why Church you know I don't I don't preach on women's hir and dress and clothes I bring it in the sermon every once in a while cuz I see some that don't do right and I bring it out and mention it but I've never seen a church yet where they preach clothline Holiness and that all that ever preach that ever amounted to anything you want to meet me at a service we'll talk about them I'm not talking to your body I'm trying to talk to your soul cuz that's where the new birth is at and that's where faith is laying if if you have it it's laying within that Soul cuz that's the only way you can be born again it's for God to come and live in you amen right see if I talk to that one inside of you he'll just come right out and tell the body what to do we have women come in here newcomers and things what oh boy most preachers what do they want boy I'll tell you what God revealed to me this week no he revealed to me about two minutes ago when he seen that short dress coming in the door and like I've always told them if theyd stay out of Walmart you don't know what I mean by that I heard a preacher one night he said I didn't have nothing to preach I went down to Walmart walked around said I got something and all he preached was on women in their clothes and their how they looked we see faith is a revelation right has God ever revealed to you that you're healed now let me explain that Brother Gary was here one night he had a real bad headache and he has those kind of headaches that he's just honest that if it do his head any good to take a gun out and shoot somebody else's head off he do it because it's so severe I've never hurt like that my wife's had him to pass out with him I've never hurt like that I've been blessed all my life been real healthy but he was supposed to come up here and let me pray for him and he didn't do it he went down the road if I miss the story he can tell all of it something happened and all it was if you just believe that you're healed it's gone and you know what it was gone have you ever had that to happen see you don't know what I'm talking about if you've never had most people don't know what I'm talking about but yet they don't understand what God has done through their life as I said it wasn't a super duper Halo light come on in the car and all these ringing and all this superpower come in it was just a knowledge that come to a man's mind and it went from his mind into his soul and brought out a reality of a deliverance and you realize that a lot of you have had that and don't know it you've had a lot of things happen and don't realize it that is in the realm of Faith have you ever just been to a place where you said I don't know why but I believe this and you know what take place now now who done that let's don't blame the Boogerman for it okay just simple little things has happened in life that you would call it and not even think about faith but you were driving down the highway and you were supposed to go this way maybe the shorter way and you just turn and go the other way and you got home and find out they had a bad wreck over there you see this thing might not be as py patterned setting flat blunt as we think it is it might be that God just allows mankind to walk in a realm to where he can get to have confidence in them I surely ain't going to say that that the devil made me do it I don't even say the devil made me do it when I do wrong well that's what it is devil made me do no you're trying to prop up an excuse you flim flamy around admit it you're the one that done it devil made me cut my hair and God knows I just cried while them scissors were going through it I just cried oh yeah you cried cuz you going to get caught up with cuz when you walked outside somebody going to say oh you cut your hair right what gets most Crooks caught because they got a soul they got to admit to somebody else they want because they don't want to live by their s and they admit to somebody else and they get caught it's all on blabbering you said what does that got to do with faith how back could a man would live by his own faith so taking this lower form of that right men attitude is this the way the prophet said it right menly attitude toward any promise will bring it to pass now what's the right menal attitude well now Lord I want you to know that I haven't done anything wrong this week I haven't lied I haven't cheated and that fell standing over beside of me he's been a dirty dog but I ain't been like it is that in the Bible am I in the Bible with the you know the man saying that Lord I've fasted I've done this but I ain't been like that sinner over there are you with me but what was the rest of the story the man that was repented in his heart went home Justified you know what the other man went home feeling Justified that's right well I read told the Lord how good I've been and he agreed with me yeah wasn't that what Tammy F said she said I asked God about putting on makeup said he never did tell me it wrong we're nice ain't we're good people but what's faith it ain't just an imagination or thought is something you actually possess that nobody can't talk you out of it now I mean I'm 74 years old I was born 1940 got goofed up on what day I was born on but they finally got that right but the point is I was born and you know you can't talk me out of that there's not much need to you trying yeah you know but what about it being so real to you come on have you ever had God to just be so real to you I've walked when I knew he was walking beside of me and I could feel his presence I'm a very emotional person but only emotional to myself you're not with me all the time I've walked when I felt his presence and I've stopped look around I've seen him I had no problem I've smelt the presence of the Lord down in the woods when I was deer hunting when there was no females with 100 m i mean 10 Mile there the prettiest perfume you've ever done ever smelled and yet at the same time he was bringing to pass what I had asked him to do but I didn't understand it and I was laying on the ground crying as a py paded little child and saying God now even some crazy female is out here I can't even deer hunt without these crazy females with their perfume brother Dale you mean you're honest to tell us yeah then about an hour later I found out he was working out his will in somebody's life but you see we think we have a great super duper Faith but you know God has to put us through the test to find out remember how we started out talking the other day God doesn't tempt Satan tempts God Tak yes there's a lot of difference in it too sounds like the same word and it reads basically the same word but there's a lot of difference in it Satan tempts you he'll put out in front of you an object that will throw you the wrong way if you used to drink he'll put you in a drunken crowd used to smoke he'll put you there but God test God don't send you to an alcoholic he don't send you into a bar no he just simply allows test and we listen to T the other night and brother R said God only test You by his word well I've been through his test God put a test in front of me and I failed it no we just got in the garbage can ourselves and blaming God for it right we got in trouble blaming him he doesn't tempt he tests Us by his word amen he don't put something in front of you to try to get trap you with it you said well what did that get out the world got out there to do that don't blame God my brother tell you know her he's a Methodist preacher he said God can't judge me for being wrong he made me me wrong I said you didn't God didn't make you wrong you made yourself wrong he said well God made good and evil I said no you're misinterpreting he knows of evil he didn't make evil said even though you quote your scripture correctly you're not quoting God God can't make wrong and in judge it for being wrong right but he can permit it yeah that's right talking to somebody the other day about the you remember the old the young Prophet that went down he was told don't you go back the wrong way don't eat with them or nothing old Prophet went down told him lied to him right and told him said God told me to tell you come on back I'm a prophet and you're a prophet he went back with the old prophet and while he was eating the old Prophet wrote rose up and said you're dead but I want to ask you a question what did God do to the old Prophet for lying God permitted him to do it right did God judge the old Prophet so you can't play with prophets prophets were ordained of God and you don't play with them why did God in the Bible tell a prophet to go marry a prostitute and have children by which was contrary to the word now you explain that see we've got all our reasoning factors that we know all about things you can't reason God's word you got to believe it because faith is the substance let's go all the way back to where God is and let him then come down to us and speak to our heart and once he speaks to you you won't have to worry about it and you know what he don't explain a lot of it you ever notice that I've heard a brother one time he's talking about the Lord told me to do this and I told him I was going to do that and the Lord told me to do this he said I argued with him for the longest said I've finally done what he said for me to do and I caught a bunch of fish I mean I just simply didn't believe him cuz you don't argue with God right he'll simply come down and tell you something these preachers can tell you in a hurry what I'm fixing to say you'll give you one thought and you one word and you'll preach for five years off of it over what he give you as one word right see we're not dealing with a peanut brain something like us as human beings we can't blame God we can't do this that or the other and let's don't call it what it is or what it ain't if it's an actual substance is to Gil we will eventually walk on that substance I may not be able to step out here like that but I will not argue that Ben hen didn't do it and I don't believe he's in this message I'm just honest now but you know what he reached a place just like a firew walker can walk across fire and never be burned he reached a place but see I'm not trying to do that there's the difference I have no desire to walk walk on CS to prove that I have the faith of God I try to keep preaching what's in here then if you can't see it's the word of God then that's your problem because we will finally get to it where the Prophet says faith is a six sense and only Born Again Believers have it you say what you going to do about the people with the healing I just got through explaining that healing for that is not based on salvation only a born again believer has that sick sense to be able to go beyond all of our senses and still believe God come on Brothers what do you think about it substance Faith the prophet called it perfect Faith substance Faith your mental Faith becomes a spiritual Revelation and when it does it becomes a substance until then it's not a substance it's only a mental Faith a concept a thought and a man stand in B metal with is just his brain capacity break life just with his mental abilities no wonder the prophet said biggest portion of our faith is mental but you know mental faith comes by hearing the word of God but there's a quote I've got it in here you know that hearing the word of God is Not Faith that's where I love to just keep reading what the prophet has to say cuz somewhere you wind up with these little beautiful nuggets hearing the word of God is Not Faith it's when it's revealed so you can say this is the word of God brother R said as long as it's laying in the pages of this book it can be questioned that's what he said but he said when it comes off of there it comes in your heart see then you got the faith you got a substance I thought we believe the new birth was the person of Jesus Christ are you listening I thought we believe the new birth no I thought it was shouting speaking in tongue believing the message I thought the prophet said it was the person of Jesus Christ coming living in you you know if it's a person of Jesus Christ then you have a substance living in you right that's it the person of Jesus Christ Living in you that's why you can't show it to nobody else he's your God and God alone I've always made this statement and I don't mean it incorrect mean it rightly brother colleag God is brother col's God brother col's God is not my god when it's my God it's my God why Jesus said I go to your father my father and your father we got the same father as long as we line up correctly then that way brother col and I's got the same daddy right because he's our father amen let's Stand Together number 225 start run here my come and queen R Heaven I want no more here's my cup fill it up with a substance you can't get warn by pained fire but you can put the darkness out of the room by one little match one little light that's what I want Jesus Christ here's myup I lift it up come and queen thirsty anybody have a de here's my it up and make have you ever prayed for a Revelation you ever asked God for a revelation I thought I had the message you can have the message every day of your life read it and study it did not mean a thing but one second in the Pres father we lay our hands up our little buddy just condemning this problem that's on his leg and Lord you just reach down and touch him he believes you Lord he thanks you for it we believe you and make it manifest in Jesus name just believe it buddy what about it faith is the substance that's what anything consist of God is a substance he's not an imagination he's a person he's real he's not a he's a person at C let's just believe it father in the name of Jesus Christ we lay our hands upon our little sister father believe in you that by your stripes she's heal she believes you we believe you we thank you in Jesus name amen Lord of my praising about your sister getting better is that what you're saying let's just pray father you know what our little buddy is trying to say I can't hear it Lord but we believe you and we thank you now you just bring it to PA in Jesus name you going to believe it buddy run dry my God anybody else think about a substance this week now see I got a great Revelation and that means you got a substance God is a substance that's where we miss a new birth we try to make him this or make him that or make him instead of making him the person of Jesus Christ well I don't understand how that can be see there and you prove you don't have faith he said it why can't we believe it love it a little more today all I tomorrow ain't God good you believe it ain't God good to give us shake hands with one another as we're leaving sing that to one another oh we believe it little more to whole lot tomorrow dism that
