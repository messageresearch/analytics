in the house of the Lord good to see you to every one of you just remember to pray for brother Dale and the Lord again strength he tends to overdo it sometimes so the Lord has to back his gear off a little bit maybe and let him rest for a little while so he's uh he's done he's done wonderful for the age that he is but he can still out work me at 20 years my senior so I don't uh try to keep up with it don't try to keep up with him preaching neither because my what's coming forth now church we don't need to miss we do not need to miss this this is important amen if you have your Bibles while you're standing let's turn to First Corinthians 2 and this will be just for a thought to we get into it won't uh it'll have something to do with it but I want to get this thought in your mind uh before we begin and thank the Lord for these projectors sure help now a few things to remember we will have a baptismal service after all right after this afternoon this afternoon service a baptismal service it at Brother terence's house uh brother Chris I think is going to finally go ahead and do what he's supposed to do it be baptized and find him a name that's right you can baptized and get a name and then also remember my buddy out in Oklahoma brother Claude he had some fainting spells like on Friday I haven't called him back but uh they hadn't called us back so just remember him and they also bought a new church so just remember them and uh their Endeavors of putting it together and it's a really neat place but just keep them in your prayers they need prayers more than anything else and that's the same way with you and I money by a lot but prayers change things right First Corinthians 2 unless fire headed before we get started up I don't think there's any other announcements we got Bible study coming up in a couple of weeks but uh just keep every one of us in our prayers ones that are not with us we got a pretty full house today but just remember the ones that are not here we're still on admission we're still on a mission to get those lost ones in not just in a church but I mean in in the bride all right get them in the safety and shelter it was good to see Brother David here Marlo hadn't seen him in a long time just pray for him I pray for each one and once they come in the door they can't leave they either leave Better or Worse right right it's going to really pound on him what he heard today so I hope God stirs his water that's right First Corinthians two let's bow our heads dear heavenly father we pray today Lord that you would father not be a an onlooker but become an active participant in this service father she would take over this lump of clay One More Time Lord and you use your words and let them be Lord heard with spiritual ears and seamless spiritual lives father we pray that you would forgive us Lord of our sins and many mistakes that we make Lord in life the mistakes we made Lord that we make I pray that you cover them by the blood father give us this day our daily bread Lord take care of each one of us you said you sent your word and healed us Lord so as the word Goes Forth may you heal each one father take this word now Lord and break it to each one Lord as you did there while you were here on the earth it kept multiplying and multiplying and multiplying father I pray that you would do that for us Lord be with the ones that are sick outside the building Lord that you would take care of them sin sick Lord mainly we want to send sick in we want them in the safety of not just a church but we want them in the safety of you father back in the Sheepfold where they should be Lord we pray that you'd touch each one now bless us you take over lord in Jesus name I ask him amen First Corinthians 2 verse 9. but as it is written I have not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit isn't that correct only only by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yea the Deep things of God so there are deep things of God okay for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him in other words if you're carnally minded today and you only take this carnally minded you're going to get a carnal application that's right but even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God so if the spirit of God dwells in you today you will understand what's going on for your day and hour now here's Paul listen now we have received right can you say that now we have received that's right see Paul's not putting it off he's saying we've received something now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God Amen let's read that one more time that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God which things also we speak so in other words brother sister it was not above Paul to speak these words right right that's what he said which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth right um but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual let me go and read 14 but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of dying for their foolishness unto him today you mind some of you is gonna your mind's gonna wander that's foolishness that's right all right let's try to keep focused but the natural man receiveth not the things things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned you may be seen the Lord and His blessings of the reading of the word and there's two things that I need to um to run by you while I got you here well I got a captive audience it's been brought to our attention that there's some of you children young adults have been chewing chewing gum and blowing bubbles and stuff like that in church you don't need to do that because the next time I see you I'm going to call a name from up here and if you parents can't look and see that your kids are chewing chewing got me blowing bubbles I'm going to call your name all right because we need to quit doing that I know we need to do that to uh okay we need to do that to keep the church clean we need to get not be a distraction we don't want anything we got enough to distract us anyway we don't need that to distract us and another thing if you look on those back two two or three benches back there it says only for children for parents and families with children okay so if you're sitting back there you need to move up front you don't have to do it today but that is reserved those last two or three rows back there are reserved for children and families with children so that the mothers can take them out that's why we put the sign on the side of the of the seat there and on the wall so you can see it okay does everybody understand that you're something that just rules that we have to follow so if you got children you can sit back there and that's fine but if you don't have children you need to settle them up this way all right that okay didn't hurt nobody's feeling that's just the way brother now wants and that's the way I want it so that's just the way it is okay uh if you got any better idea we'll put all the kids up front and all y'all on the back but that way gonna work so but just remember to do that just honor that way it keeps the kids in the back and and everybody's gonna have to keep running in and out running in and out running in and out from here back to there okay just keep that in your mind keep that in your heart brother dick said he wanted a report on South Carolina camp or maybe you all do everything went wonderful and well we survived we fed about 150 146. people 150 people brother Mark was with us and the Donnie and sister Susan and always join Gwen there and Joyce and dad didn't make it this time but we'll forgive them but uh and with anybody else brother Boyd and Sister Janet and Jason Rebecca came on Saturday and she brought me a documentary and I just praise the Lord for that because you need it when you lay there you need all kind of all the help you can get it but we had a good time uh we had exactly we had maybe like 40 or 50 dollars left over so we had plenty to feed the people everybody had a wonderful time uh everybody was fed well and the services went really well until the power went off Sunday morning in the middle of the service and it was about 90 degrees in the sanctuary so yeah it was just the old devil but it was a good camp we had a good time and thank all of you for putting your time effort and money into making it happen again this year so you give yourself a hand immediately all right man let's get started and here in Corinthians let's we know for a fact and my brother and I were talking about this the other day and it's kind of hard to do I wanna I want to make sure that we understand one thing when I say that we're going to speak today on true seed now true seed does not mean that there's that there is a false seat all right there is a false seat but remember where we're going to read it in a minute when we put it on the screen but not right now where in Revelations it talks about the faithful and true witness Jesus wasn't a false witness right he was the faithful and true witness and we'll read in just a minute but I want to get these things kind of in your mind because I may be a little hard today because I want us to get something remember one thing if if we have the mind of Christ which we believe we do if we're born again correct we have the mind of Christ I was telling them down to Sunday school class this morning ever how little small Speck of the ocean you have you have all of the ocean the chemicals in the ocean so if you're just a baby born again baby today you've got all of God that you need amen but you have a journey that you have to go through all right so ever had a little speck of God if you have the mind of Christ which that's what Paul told us to have then you do have the mind of Christ if you're born again when you believe that you're you know your your um a newborn babe or been in a message for 30 years what does it matter right Paul says we must have the mind of Christ right now now if you paint the mind you take like brother Reynold made those um wonderful illustrations about Beethoven you take Beethoven if you take the spirit of Beethoven and I can't play a lick on the on the piano but if you took the spirit out of Beethoven and put that Spirit into me today I could go over there and I could create a a great Orchestra right and what about the mind of God glory what brother Dale's been preaching all these things we're going to say I'm going to try to tie a lot of things together maybe if you have the mind of Christ why can't you see my question is why can't we see I'm saying we why can't we see that we were back there nine people we're gonna read it right right but when you read the word of God that's not God telling you a story right a story all right that's God playing it out through you know come on people that's what we got to believe we can't keep putting this thing off over here that God's coming to no that's right if I took this book and I was the author of this book if I was the author of this book right here but brother Colin wasn't the author but he read the book it's just a good story that's right right that's right it's just a good story that's right right same way with the message book which I don't have oh there we go good story right man exactly this is just a good story that's right I told him not in Sunday school this morning Satan read these before we did he was here Harrison to take all of my brain sorry brother all of my brain get the point forget about me if I could take all of my brains that wrote this I said I actually remember remember God's mind is real amen more real like brother now said this morning so this right here is more real than the pages that I'm looking at right here right man but if I'm some way took this because I wrote it I wrote this book books book right here now if any of you read this book it would just be well okay that's good story and that's what it's been down Through the Ages right amen but if I was to some way take my brain out that wrote this and put it into his brain and throw his away then when he opened this book he'd say man I wrote that right exactly people that's a mind of Christ all right that's what we gotta believe that we have now sure we got a car on mine that's right but if we got one little speck of the mind of Christ just what I read you even the Deep things of God can be understood because it's wrote in this book and if that author comes to you and becomes a part of you Gloria not just comes to see you every once in a while that's right but advised amen Satan abides with this morning the Lord does sometimes you know you know why I calls me lady oh bless you but if we have the mind of Christ we should be able to understand what is going on for the day and the hour that we're living in that's right man that's why he puts you here in this age to understand what he wrote because we're not just one page of this book over in Revelations he told John to not just eat one chapter right right he told John to eat the whole book and when you eat the book it becomes a part of you and then you can what digest the things out of here see a lot down Through the Ages they couldn't do that because they surely they had the mind of Christ but it's like I was telling this morning I'm gonna stay out here a little while it's hot up there it's cooler around here but I was telling them this morning even back in the Roman Catholic time in the in the Dark Ages what happened was Constantine looked and he saw a group of religious people that had power not in money and not in government they had power in a church they had power because what people is a church right yeah that's right without this message without people sitting here today I'd just be talking to the wall right so the people made the message so he saw these people and he saw this great powerful Roman government yeah he said if I get these two together so what did he do he took the pull the religious people in pull the political people in instead of now a Roman Empire you've got a Holy Roman Empire all right now what has become it was dirty now's become holy in their eyes and we know what it was Satan doing the work but he was gathering this to this I said well now if the if the devil can do that he's an imitator of God correct right right so God must have done it first amen so he's got the spirit over here and he's got the word over here he said if I ever get these two together in a group of people it'll be a powerful Army and that's our problem a lot of times we got a lot of we got a lot of spirit sometimes and not enough word that's right didn't brother Brown say that about the Pentecostal exactly he said you Pentecostals have got your spirit but you don't know what to do with it you put you fundamentalists you've got what to do with it but you don't have the spirit he said if I ever get you two together powerful army man well now he's talking about Pentecostal people I'm talking about today today get to Spirit in the word we got mechanics and Dynamics it's okay to say well we got mechanics and it's okay to say we got Dynamics but don't keep them apart yes troop City will put it together true seed not true as in false I'm talking about listen brother Brown said we talked about this what sparked this whole thing of the true sea will come with group C before somebody we got a real you there's a difference in being arrogant and confident being arrogant is of the devil being confident I believe God likes people being confident because Paul was very positive he said you'll be judged in my mind gospel some of you think I say things up here or say things outside that you wouldn't want to deal with sister Gail said she was she didn't uh she didn't want to say it because she don't mind she said I don't want I you wouldn't be my I don't want you to be my judge and you know what I thought I said well if God says it from this pulpit history don't matter it will be your judge regardless because where's your judgment gonna start right yeah that's what it starts right here judgment starts here and yet we might get into ourself a little bit too much my grandbaby's been up here where's Deanna oh she's asleep okay you love the Lord all right now let's turn to Romans 8. but listen bro you're going to pull the quote up number one please but you can understand this book but you've got to have the mind of the writer to really know where you come from because see if you were the author if you have part of you and the author have balkanized brother brand amuse vulcanized one time that's your perfect man vulcanized when you taking Heat this up now you can't heat rubber and plastic so you gotta have the right material right right but when you put the two together and melt them together guess what we got recycled things you know recycle bottles that come from probably 100 different bottles but you can't tell the difference because it's been melted down that's right that's right and it's been put together all right so now we're going to read a couple of quotes here now in our journey this is what I want you to remember we may be a little lengthy today in our journey we have two things that you and I have to deal with I'm gonna keep you busy today two things we got to deal with two things we got to deal with it you've got a journey of being a Christian right right just the 565 filled with the Holy Ghost that was Through the Ages amen amen all right now we're called to something a little bit different right when I say different it don't mean we got to be a different Christian right but we do got to understand something that the other ages have never understood before right that's why that you're gonna hear that you hear quotes that seem like brother Brown was talking about this seeing he says you I read it to the to the church out in Oklahoma are ready to quote brother Brian so your eternal life begins right here at the altar IO and I read on the quote out of the same book brother Brown was carrying the thought on over a little bit further he said your eternal life was before the foundation of the world right you never was born on any certain day right now get this is very simple brother Brandon was looking and talking to a group of people it needed salvation amen but now when he turns and looks through God's eyes and you're already born again he can say that you never was that's right Martin only ain't certain nothing man exactly if you have eternal life that eternal life never happened in your hand but you had to come to a place to receive it so brother Branham didn't quit altar called right that's right a lot of all these people say well you always was eternal and all this stuff Wayne brother Ram just quick I have an altar call why he believed in one thing we're human on this side right and we need to stay here but the savior is over here saying hey if you've got me and you you never started on any certain day you never be gone on any certain date you always why is he turned right there right right man correct so now we can take quotes and see that brother Brandon was preaching to humanity but then every once in a while brother then God would drop down and say he'd speak right straight to the bride amen you always was eternal you never was born on any certain day right did you hear what I said yes God you know right spoke to you through that man right he was trying to connect to you and tell you hey if you've got me inside of you this is what's gonna happen but if you don't this is what's going to happen you need me that's right and there you responded to the word all right let's read this quote because you're gonna get started in your journey you have two parts number one you're born again right right number two you have a call in this age for a body change right right no other agent had that call that's right exactly all right so you can be born again listen to me real close you can be born again but if you don't come up to that next level you're going to die and go by the grave you are going not going to make the change alive so I said it's going to be hard just again that's why I can say it down in Sunday school class if you're still smoking and drinking you might not I don't mean you're going to go to hell because you're sure not gonna make a body change right that's right I mean downstairs we're talking about the seals right a whole lot different than just talking about justification certification of baptism of the Holy Ghost a quote where the man that that was going to go drink the beer and God took the shirt but he took his servant home that servant didn't get a body change right right remember the preacher said I quit right right brother Brown said God took his serve at home you know what that's what's happening now God's going to take me and you home if we don't quit acting up right right he's gonna take me and you home right if we don't quit acting up exactly be born again for 50 years keep acting up we're going to go by the grave exactly so it's not the person that comes to be destinated eternally from God but to see it on the word now way back there way too far back for the human mind to grasp the Eternal god with eternal thoughts thought and decreed Jacob have I love East all have I hated so it's not you this precious little thing that we walk around in yeah but God thought so much of it that when he connected with you see see when he connected with you he's never going to depart that's right so if an eternal God had Eternal thoughts and he went wrong to start with if he's connected to you that'll take us in a Rapture amen that'll take us in a rapture before Anita was born nor do you have done good or evil let's go and go to the next quote saves time brother Joe number two now I'm going to read these now this word true he's talking about faithful and true witness now this word true is the same word we saw back there in Revelation 3 7 you recall listen to this you recall that it does not mean true as in contrast with false right it has a richer look over there a richer deeper meaning by far amen it expresses perfect realization in contrast to partial ain't that what we were just talking about harsher realization is you're a born-again Christian today the call for this age is the body change not just to stay a born-again Christian God had that through seven Church ages and that's not what the call of this age is right right listen now back in the Philadelphian they used to come into the Lord was drawing now what great love that age manifested for him then it reminds me he reads let's read with them we Rejoice also we haven't seen him but we have felt him we know him now as much as our limiting limiting senses can let us listen to what he's saying but one day it will be face to face that's right that's right that is for this age what's more of an impact when you read it on there isn't it it's for this age he is coming at the end of this age partial realization will be made perfect realization completed realization Hallelujah we have been looking through a glass Darkly but soon it will be face to face we have been going from glory to glory I say we've been going around the mountain for 40 years but soon it will be right in the glory and in his glory we'll shine we shall be this is not in the Millennium right right exactly right this is not in the Millennium this is now if we don't become that now there won't be a millennium all right we'll shine we shall be like him wondrously like in Jesus our savior Divine isn't that wonderful we are completing him that is true he would not lie to us about it but one day we will be changing the atoms we will put on any more talenting right we will be all swallowing up in life than we will realize realization all right pull up number three brother joke please this is from the Greek Mexican this is where it says a faithful and true Witness in Revelations 3 14. the word true means that which has not only the night you read it don't worry about this down here some of this stuff don't have to we don't have to put on there that which is not only the name and resemblance got it what are you and I a continuation of that creation all right all right but the real nature corresponding to the name you're fixing to find that out in a little while in every respect corresponding to the idea signified by the name real true genuine amen that's the faithful and true witness now when we talk about true seed we're not casting away other seed right but we're talking about true seed the one that not only has the name but the resemblance the real nature corresponding to the name we're bride right that's right we're proud in the last church I used to take a Rapture that's what we're identified with all right everybody say Amen isn't that right now put out number four this is way Dale quote now what has Brothers been talking about and then we're gonna I want everybody to turn to Romans 8. what are we been talking about now here this is what came to me the other day when we I was sitting up here kind of meditating on what I was going to preach in Oklahoma but the part of the word you heard and responded to was the part or the attribute of God set aside for you before the world Amen you want me to decide for that for you you had the hero sermon those of you that are born again you know what I'm talking about you heard a sermon and something in that sermon sparked are just something clicked right what was it a sermon about though uh horses and cattle no it was a sermon that a preacher brought from what amen the word amen everybody has their favorite scriptures you know what mine is it's posted up there because that's where I come from but you heard and that part of the word that you heard and responded to remember in Acts there was not the Holy Ghost didn't fall on any person until after or during the word being preached amen right so what were they responding to the 3000 responded to Peter standing up and saying hey you killed this guy called Jesus and what did they say man brother what must we do to be safe what was he doing he was preaching them the gospel right that's right right out of the word of God because it's in the word of God right so the part of the word you heard and responded to him was that attribute that God had in his mind for you right waiting on you all right but if it's Eternal it was with him before the foundation Lord amen right pretty good quote that's right that's Genesis 1 26-27 and here's what happened when we were in the Garden of Eden sorry when I say we I'm looking at the Garden of Eden okay sorry but but when when the Garden of Eden when we were there I was thinking about that this morning it's just kind of funny but the thoughts of God are eternal but ideally Adam wants to bring forth all the thoughts of God right so when Adam and Eve did what they did God had to curse the ground he didn't curse out of me cursed the ground and he said hold that thought right he should hold that thought of course the thoughts couldn't come at that time exactly right you know we always say hold that thought well that's what God did he said hold that thought I got to come and do it myself right now all right but what was it the thought of me and you it wasn't thought of anything of cars and General Motors and this and that and this no it was of me and you because if it stops are Eternal and he can't have a new one or change his talk then his first thought about us back in Genesis 1 has not ever changed so he had the word waiting on you because the word's Eternal right right right it responded to the part of the attribute of God because what is the attribute of God this Bible is the activation of God Amen right it tells everything about God there's not a hidden chapter somewhere that people don't know this is the word of God the mind of God transferred down all right but it was set aside for you when he set aside Genesis 1 26 and 27 he didn't set aside Dean Gibby no he said this guy's going to respond to that scripture right right and when he responds to that scripture it becomes eternal amen he becomes Eternal that's right the word always was right now he's become eternity amen Lord pretty good but two parts we got to deal with we don't kick people out you can cut that off Joe thank you bro let me tell you something we got to kick this thing up a little higher right we got to get this gear going just a little bit further than we're going now because we're just going like this we're chasing our Tail as the old saying goes the dog chases tail it doesn't get anywhere right right and actually he never catches his title right so we're just running around and around in circles we got to realize that there's something here that is higher than any time on the face of the Earth right right amen it's the same word of God it's the same Bible but brother Branham as the prophet of God you remember he said he said when he uh I think it was Gene gold or one of them he had a dream remember and he said brother Brandon was out on this like this little platform this little saucer and he started climbing up and he said Gene you can't come out here only God can bring you out here now I just believe this I'm just dumb enough to believe it that wasn't just for brother Brown he didn't say it God's bringing me out here and nobody else he said only God can bring you to this position you as a human man can't do it that's right see but everybody puts brother random way up here says oh man he's he's up here where no if we don't get into that if we don't get into that we're lost not only lost to go in the house see now I don't mean losing going to hell but we're lost in what we're supposed to bring forth amen we've lost it somewhere so when you hear me talk about this it may not mean this but when we're downstairs talking about the seals we're in a higher form amen we're not dealing with babies anymore that's right man we got to stop dealing with babies I'm not talking about babies in Christ oh baby but I'm talking about all these little ideas and feelings and all this stuff that we got going around and all right you know and missing church and skipping this you guys think another day just stupid man if you miss Wednesday night service you missed 52 Services a year away service on Wednesday night you miss 52 sermons right right if you only come one time on Sunday that's a 104 sermons and how are we going to take our body change doing that we cannot and folks it's not work you sit right here and die in a few amen and come every Circle if you come every service expecting to meet God and not somebody sitting beside you he'll give you what you expect but think about that you ever thought about that if you miss winning tonight's service you missed 52 Services a year you know brother random as a quote and I didn't bring him but brother Brown said you know what said the one time you missed see God may want to bring you something right that's it now I'll paraphrase it he may want to bring you something that service and you miss it right and you don't have to give an account for it I say you're going to give an account for it because you admit because you missed it God didn't miss it right right these two people always here in church God and the devil Romans 8. you love the Lord but everybody got this settled in their mind I mean we read all the quotes it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally but the seed of the word all right got that all right then we got the uh the part where that the word when that word comes to you like when I told you there when that word comes to you and you respond to that then that makes you part of the word that's right okay and that was eternal God always had that waiting on you ready all right and when you responded to that though when you put a seed in the ground and it gets up about this high do you go out there and go corn oh yeah Sister pig you've done that before but no really you go okay she's in the ground she's playing she's got life she's growing corn take it to the market put in the back of your pickup truck everybody's saying where I'm going with this it's not matured yet but it is a grain of corn it is a corn seed a product of it it has two little shoots but it hasn't come to full maturity but it did have life it did grow it was put in Good Earth Born Again people but are we going to stay here are we going to pluck that thing up and say that's it no we can't do that not in this age right we're talking about the fourth age downstairs in that fourth age brother Brown said it was just enough to be called a Christian and give your life for the gospel and that's all they were required exactly Luther's age was required to say the just shall live by faith not by Penance not by what the Catholic Church says they just shall live by faith but Luther would go home from the from the church and he'd go and get him a beer and smoke him a pipe we can't do that right why because that plant was here now that plant's put a stalk on it now that plant's put a tassel and now there's something on the very end of it that was just like the original that was planted that's right right right right exactly remember what brother random says he says the two shoots the life goes out of them yeah life goes into stock right life goes out of that right exactly life goes into but he said the life goes out of those right he said there's only life in the original seat amen right right carriers now that doesn't make them not part of the plant that does not make them not born again right right everybody understand that we're not we're not putting excuse me putting people out right we're trying to draw them in Glory we're trying to draw them in we're not trying to do away with them but you are the one that control how high that plant grows amen right right and when brother Dale ever gets us down to the Earth he's going to explain that right right that's where the explanation comes to where you do have something to do with it right you can pull that plant up and say I got no Let It Grow all right let it grow let it grow Let It Grow and it will become you know what if you let it grow you don't have to do the same sister Andy you don't have to go out there every day and go you're a corn plant no it knows it's a corn plant leave it alone fertilize it a little bit water it right right take it to church with you sometime Romans 8 now we're gonna go through right now we got number do we do number four yes we did okay all right so now Romans 8 I know Dad's been through this now let's just kind of flip through it just real quick and uh I hope everything I said is okay so far that you'll understand that we're not trying to say true seed and salt seed or we're not trying to say fruit seed and we're gonna we're gonna no it's not for us to do it's not for us to say it's not alone but you do have something to do with this that's right all right you can say I'm going in a rapture but these things that we've got to do to get us there excuse me all right Romans 8. now we know that there are three stages in this adoption and in your journey here's the first stage verse chapter 14 for as many are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God which is what Genesis 1 26 and 27 that's where you're that's where your new birth begin that was where God knew you were going to respond to that word had that word waiting for you it is eternal you you're not the son of Samuel and Peggy Dale anymore you're my child ciao I said ciao you're my child all right let's read this real slow for you have not responded again to fear fear right false evidence appearing real yeah yeah don't ever fear anything right because Satan's gonna put a scarecrow up in front of that crop bro you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption right in other words now you have the ability to become adopted right exactly we're not going to read the other one but you know though you were a son you still had tutors and governors but you were always a son you got part of the inheritance because right here's what it tells you right here that even in this baby stage whereby we cry I have a father now see there we cry because we're babies amen you see that yes yes father father we cry you get them down further you don't cry we got a checkbook now with Jesus it with our daddy's name on it he hands it to us and we cash it when we get down to the end he's just gonna give us a blank check we signed the bottom and we go cash it right all right now listen but watch we got a journey you know but you never see the spirit of adoption whereby we cry I'm a father the spirit itself bearth witness with our spirit who now that's Paul the spirit capital S right capital S that's the holy spirit is agreeing with our spirit it's a witness with our spirit inside ourselves not the flesh guy not the creation right not the creation that your mom and daddy brought because we're going to deal with that in just a minute right watch how this Authority come the spirit itself bear with witness with our spirit that we will become the children of God all right my glasses are bad oh oh we are the children of God orange present right and I'll quote the rest of it and if children Ayers and Joint heirs with Jesus Christ at the baby stage of adoption amen because we get what he gets that's right we get what he gets Laurie air is not like this air is like this amen but he gets you get right equal portions amen hey baby adoption that's right when you just start your journey amen thank you jeez people we live way below our privileges right and if children then heirs Heirs of God and join ours with Christ if so be if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also White that's baby stage adoption right because those who he is truly Justified he's already glorified it says right there right that's right amen now you may have to die and go by the grave and get your glorification right right right right right it's your choice but we are in the time that it can happen let's just be real honest and I'm going to be confident here and bold Paul couldn't preach this sermon boy that hurt some of you older brothers is that correct right amen Paul could not preach this sermon today right exactly there's no understanding for it now the Holy Ghost was there the word of God was there but see Paul was writing the word prophesying right right that there would be a group come to fulfill what he saw that's what I and they really enjoyed that you know uh telling dad that that they they'd never seen that in Oklahoma that those who prophesy must die if you prophesy something then that means you're prophesying something to come that's right something to come right right if we prophesy it's something to come right exactly right right so we have to pass on so that that can come that's right because that is greater right than me standing here doing the prophecy nobody understand that man let me say it one more for sure people like me I really didn't get that the first time anyway I think but really if you stand here and you prophesy on something to come it's greater than you standing right here man right right and if you prophesy that means you're not going to be there because that's got to come right here amen so if we keep prophesying what's gonna happen we're gonna die right because this right here is greater and it's coming Glory really it's not coming it's staying there we're meeting it right right right everybody got that yeah so if we prophesy oh there's a great bride coming you're dead we're dead right we're dead if we say oh there's a great translation coming oh it's coming no it's here in 1963 folks that judge came down and he did not leave right amen white wig exactly he was a judge where do you think that's going to come from right the bride that's standing on the earth that's right not the bride before they can't judge you can't judge if you're already dead you have to be alive to be a judge when 1963 when that judge when that when that hood came down that white wig came down he came to judge this Earth glory and he came to judge this Earth I ain't talking about the ball that we stand on I'm talking about this sir he come to judge this guy right here because when he brought the seals this is what he judged and you know what he said now I call you bro you're perfect you're complete Roman hey because all the other ages couldn't come to understanding that we come to you that's right Paul Peter they were prophesying brother Benny the whole Bible every Prophecy in the Bible speaks to you amen amen if you're the Bride of Jesus Christ that's why I said before remember we don't type anything right everything types us amen exactly you say oh what she is him remember she is him so whatever types him types us and he's the whole type of the Bible Moses didn't we don't type Moses right Moses talk to us all right right there's only one person that don't type us and that's Jesus because he's our husband we don't he's only one and it's in the scripture that that we don't type with because he is the great one and we're his bride but see everything else he balls around that when he was on the cross we were on his mind we were the ones he came after he did not come after the ones that are not written in that land Book of Life that's right Sherry came to die but everybody would but he knew that they wouldn't right all right now verse 17 and his children then heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ and so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together right he's got a marriage in there it's together we're glorified together right right you know Jesus had to be glorified right right man the flesh Jesus had to be glorified Glory the flesh right flesh had to be glorified yes right so we're glorified with him right amen we were there with him right right now look you can get all carnal and say boy I can remember when I was back before the foundation world or I can remember being on the shores of gallery but can why do you think brother Brown told so vivid a story now him being a prophet I believe God could let him see back later and literally see Even Adam in the garden and be able to describe it down to her hair and her eyes and I Adam and everything else but why can't you and I don't believe three want that Prophet said and then every once in a while God made sister Anna he may blow the clouds back and let us see what he's really talking about right Brother Dean c not not C I understand right understand what's going on folks this is not a gospel that we just sat in here and hold the football and sit on the front view and say touchdown no you gotta run you might get knocked down and blindsided every once in a while right but you know what get back up all right we got the Playbook all right we got the Playbook you know I saw a thing the other day he's going to Baptist Church he said God gives tests test tsts God gives tests but they're all open books but they're all open book 10. that's good every test he gives us everything we need for the test that we have is in this book and you know what I said see this is where you get in trouble I said God that book might not be open to them but I know you opened it to me all right because we're an open book group yeah you can read the book like this right here like most people do but we can see what's going on inside this group right so we really do when we have a test we do have an open book test we ought to shop more than the back to shout about it Amen to that right all right let's finish verse 18. now here we go and start into the second stage for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in Jesus oh what'd I say in US amen watch Paul he's bringing the he's bringing the children heirs John heirs with Christ and then what'd he say he said now it's going to be revealed and he tells you exactly where it's going to be revealed at it's gonna be revealed in us right man now part of everyone to get all over brother Danny he got a portion of it he got his portion right sure he was the pattern messenger one of the greatest prophets but like I said before his understanding was limited by what word he had sure do you really believe another day you ever thought about this do you really believe that Paul when he was writing those letters to Thessalonians and Corinthians do you really believe you thought that was going to be putting Eternal Word of God I don't know I'm just asking a question I mean I'm really not just you but I I sometimes you're a thinker like me we sit down and think about things I mean if I'm writing a letter to the Thessalonians and I say hey or the Corinth he said hey you guys are really good for nothing because that's what he was saying you know you need to stop this you need to quit this you need to quit doing this you need to start doing this well he was right on the letter right remember there was no Bible until about the 1500s right or 1800s there was no Bible what we consider a Bible there were Scrolls over here they were scrolled over here they were scrolled over here but somebody brought together amen and God said put that one right there put that one right there because this is for all my church not just the first one all right put this one right here this letter to the Thessalonians to the Corinthians to the Ephesians look at the Ephesians it's a very short book but look how powerful it is why because they could take strong meat they can understand what Paul was talking about right all right the Corinthians he kept going back and kept going back but you know what they're in the Eternal Word of God Amen so they might have messed up but you know what God gets forgiveness but you know what they didn't take a body change that's right but the junk that they were doing and you and I are not gonna take a body change with the junk that we're doing right yeah we need to get rid of but look she'll get be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US for the earnest expectation of the creature or creation weighteth for the manifestation of the sons of God are the what the making known that we're here yeah yeah people were here not that we're coming right we have arrived that part of that scripture of authority is on the scene right somebody is alive and going to say this body will not die right it might be Josiah nine nine years old Lord maytary another 10-15 years we're gonna put a lot in like Danny said toes up just be honest let's be honest with each other 15 years I'll be 66 years old so I'll be oh like y'all are all now but um but you know think about it though somebody is on the scene that's the way I read the scripture now I told you but there's a fire in my bones you read that scripture don't read that scripture for somebody else read that scripture for yourself the people are on the same to do the work right word's been here remember it's eternal right it was already fourth Foundation to work right now but we've arrived we've come to the place where you can look at you cannot look at me but you can look at the word of God and say that ain't nothing but the truth now what did that bring sister had to write it brought her the spoken word exactly it brought her her two sons right in other words he said whatever you say you know I asked for 10 billion dollars God would have had to give it to her exactly but he knew what she would want that's why I could say that amen he knew what she wanted and when he knew what she wanted it was already there waiting on her whatever you need that's not what I said it's waiting on you all right to realize it's already here that's right remember he does it reveals it makes it manifest by the time he's made a manifest he's going to work through a couple of stages dogs over here doing this right waiting on me and you to get to that stage of manifestation does it reveals it makes it manifest well that's what we're talking about right here manifestation of the sons of God all right everybody all right amen not going too long I may need to go about another 10-15 minutes all right for the earnest expectation of the creature verse 19 waited for the manifestation of the sons of God now watch this that's not us waiting read that again that's not us waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God this world is waiting we're not waiting read that again cause our creation waited for the manifestation of the sons of God I've always then when the fall happened before the fall Adam and Eve were in the Garden of Eden and the Lions and the Tigers just played around them yeah they scratch your back scratch your belly just like a bunch of little kittens because they didn't eat each other yeah yeah but after that fall happened oh what a place Adam was in where he could walk through the garden and just move stuff then he couldn't do that anymore and then the lion instead of looking at him as a as a friend he looked at him as food that's right and then Adam started watching the big cats eat the little calves and the other cats eating the smaller cats you know the chain down through the chain don't you think that really hurt Adam yes well you know what that line didn't want to do that right that tiger doesn't want to do that that elephant doesn't want to do that all those animals don't want to do that you know what they're doing they're looking at Adam and go and hurry up yeah we don't want to do this this is not in the original exactly this is not the way I'm supposed to be that's right I'm not supposed to eat meat so the whole world growing it and waited and travail we're going to read together with us so they're waiting on us once we start manifesting what was lost remember that's Redemption bringing back what was originally here come back to that sure we saw it a few times with brother Branham with the storm and and that's what a preacher really did a good job one time you know because remember when brother Brown spoke the storm out of existence remember the two dogs the two does walked right up to brother Brown he said they shouldn't have done that right do you know what they were doing they were going Adam is that you Adam if you made it back you're not gonna shoot me good isn't that right right that's what those deer were doing nature so let's Master amen that's right for just a moment now he saw they saw Adam back in full view move this move this don't do this do this don't do that now listen you and I are never going to come to the place where we need to move trees I don't think or we don't need to do everything that Adam did but let me tell you something this whole world has grown in to come back into that condition the way that we are not their ruler because if you rule by this it's wrong that's right if you're real by this it's right I'm talking about the spirit you ruled by this it's wrong this is what got us all in trouble we're real about this kingdoms Kings we're supposed to be Kings and Priests but not act like some Kings and Priests that I know right why because we're ruled by the inside guy well when's it ever going to happen when's it gonna happen that's right if it's there you're the one that's keeping it from happening I said if it's now that's right we're going to show our colors because this is going to show who's got it and who don't know man okay let's finish because the creature let's go back to 20. for the create for the creature which makes subject to vanity not willingly but by a reason of him who has subjected the same in hope in other words they weren't willingly the the natural world didn't willingly fall the natural world was cursed by what Adam and Eve did so they didn't do it willingly right right right so they didn't do it so it's not their fault that's right it's our fault and when we started understanding that when we get this thing stand back up right because remember we resurrected right sitting in Heavenly places wasn't resurrected me and that means you came up that's right you were once down in the earth now you've come up out of the Earth all right so now listen we're getting close to getting that checkbook with a name on it for the creature was made 70 to vanity not willingly but by reason of him last subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered also so we're gonna be delivered from something and they're also going to be delivered right all right from the bondage of corruption this guy sure this is correct remember corruption must become Incorruptible when the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty Liberty freedom we're bound now you can say you were you're bound by this but when are we going to start believing that what's inside of us is more real than this yeah I hope you caught that exactly that's right because your soul Came From Another Dimension that's right I mean the soul of God Came From Another Dimension even your soul came from another Dimensions but the soul of God Came From Another Dimension so what's more real right can you and I go to a dimension can I go walk in that wall no no you know why I can't walk to that wall number one because I don't believe it let's be truthful but if I drop dead right here you wouldn't have to open the door to let me out that's right that's right right that's right amen so watch more watch more Supernatural right this or this one you can't see all right this one right here is more real inside so now when we start getting our stinking thinking like the brother preached the other day when we start getting our stinking thinking away from well we're trapped in this whole body and there's nothing we can do about it and this is just something more pastels that we got to deal with no this has got to go with us right because that's what we came here to Earth to do is to pick up our natural body because God was going to live listen to me God was going to live in flesh in a human body for eternity that was his plan I didn't say was I meant it is his plan right he just had to hold his thoughts there for a little while you and I had to hold us then as we came to the Earth through this through the bedding ground we came one by one but now he calls for full manifestation of that person right not that person that person was born from Mr Miss Kylie this person and he's going to deal with that right right but God gave us a way to deal with it amen he didn't leave this thing hopeless he didn't leave this thing where we couldn't do it that's right there just was never enough word for us to absorb right right that's right because they were true seed down through the end time through the through the seven churches it was true see quickened by the word of God and let's just be honest with each other has anybody ever been healed in your shadow was in Peter's Day we're supposed to have a greater than Solomon here right right uh if you ever walk by and said Silver and Gold Have My none yeah we've all done that come on people you lay hands on and they get healed sure it's not what you did but it was a connection silver and gold how about none amen but such as I have you gotta have it to get it right you gotta have it to give it that's the key if nothing happens maybe you ain't got it right let's just be honest with each other if you ain't got it there's nothing there to get one brother randomly always said his mother said you can't get blood out of the tournament because there's no personal no blood in return all right verse 21 let's finish because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God look what he's done for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaleth in pain together two very important words until now right that that's where I stopped until now right because I never really understood I thought that third stage was the change of the body we know better than that now right but watch how God is bringing us through the authority stage and right before he starts talking about the adoption to with the Redemption the body he says we've grown and Prevail until now in other words we've grown and prevailed until August the 21st yeah 2011. we've grown within ourselves amen wondering what is this change of the body what is this adoption what is all this crazy stuff that some of you that are new here that that that may not understand don't look around Rick I'm calling you um but all that is going to come to pass in somebody that's alive right so until now we've had a problem oh man that's why that's what Paul's saying we've groaned and prevailed until now right but he was prophesied right he didn't see that right but you and I are sitting where we can literally folks let me tell you something gold prices are going up through the roof who owns the gold of the worm Roman Catholic Church they're sitting over there getting richer while the whole world is getting poorer they're sitting up you understand what I just said the Richard day while every country in the world is getting poorer and poorer and poorer that's right that's Bible prophecy coming to pass right before your eyes you're sitting in it now it's not a prophecy that's right brother it's a reality and guess what they're gonna do they're gonna say Okay United States you got the biggest military you're all over the world we'll tell what you want to do and you enforce it there's your image to the beast that's right yeah and we're in the Book of Revelation yes standing in it not looking for it to come we're standing in it right now right now so we are now the sons of God right not going to be and the last part but we know that the whole creation girls incredible tremendous and pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves growing within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the Redemption of our bodies to understand the Redemption exactly have you ever looked at that word let me pull it right back over here and let me read it because I read it to them and Oklahoma I'll find it do it means how about and to understand or it also means the intellect or the understanding right to it that's what means Strong's 56 13 I think they read it but it's the intellect or the understanding he said oh intellect intellectual person on the face of the Earth and let's not forget one thing if he came to you and gave you his mind he didn't give you a lesser part of him that's right right he didn't give you an extra part of him he didn't say oh now Danny from Banks County I'm just gonna give him a little bit I'll be laughing the rest of them no brother Danny when he gave me the new birth you know what he gave you the same God Amen he give brother Brown exactly the same God that was in Jesus Christ the same God that was before the foundation of the world all right the same God that's not back there anymore he's here he's here to do the work we need to let him do it all right that's the whole problem we need to let him do it we need to let him do the work let us quit trying to figure it out but you know what he said we can understand the Deep things of God right right brother Joe if you want to put up possessing the enemy's Gates 1958. this is the prophet but I don't believe that the true Seed of Abraham will fail they'll stand just as gallant and loyal as Abraham did all right thank you Lord now we've got the Bible and we've got a prophet remember David believed what his Prophet said so the giant was not involved David believed that that the prophet Samuel anointed him to be king and it really didn't matter what was going to happen right he was going to be king because he believed this Prophet right so if we believe our Prophet guess what look what he said but when the testing comes that's where we fail but I don't believe that the true Seed of Abraham will fail that's right are you true sick of Abraham that's your choice all right spoken words Regional seat 19. 62. then from a little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ The Beloved bride a virgin a virgin of his word now I didn't have the rest of this but I want you to read this right here and then we'll close Glory sometimes we don't read all of them right we'll be fulfilled all that has been promised for his word and the Virgin who knows no man-made Creed or Dogma right are you part of that great that's the question you gotta answer but out of the true sea will come a group right thank you Harvest Time 1964. look hurry there must come a true seed there has just got to be because he's coming for the bride will not spot a wrinkle now let's stop right there if you're a bride for spot and wrinkle you're going to die and go by the grave right I'm talking about this outside guy all right the inside guy's never going to die right this I got never had to spot a wrinkle the inside guy never never cussed it never run around and never fooled around never said a bad word amen but we gotta deal with this guy yeah cause we're still connected yes right because he's coming for the bride without spotter wrinkle he's coming for it a word Vindicated Brian oh she'll be such a little bitty group Jesus said as it was in today's the north where an eight Souls were saved is that right so shall it being the coming of the son of man how many I don't know right but of course the bride's gonna be made up of millions you read in the Bible but that's down to the ages we're talking about this age right here not worried about another age all right let's read one more another joke if I can find it Satan's not there with a shot 429 1965. he must have knew that was the next one I was going to read he shall be lying about the evening time seed come forth from Mary but it was not her seed it was the promise of God right now she was a carrier so Mary doesn't have anything to do with it but the true seed must come right exactly Mary top Pentecost remember the show exactly she wasn't the seed but now then she became the seed right sure right in the upper room exactly when she went to the upper room and became born again she received the one that she birthed naturally she received it spiritually man okay so we don't do it see you somebody said well that Mary was just dog no she's not dog meat no he's making a point he's giving you a tie he produces the seed come forth from her Jesus Christ but she had nothing to do with it that's right your sisters can't say that let's just be honest if you have children you can't say that that's right you can't say if you didn't have anything to do with it that's right yeah hello you did but now Mary didn't America said be it unto me according to Thy word that's right but it was not her seed it was the promise of God Amen the carry of life was the woman and I married the seed so much closer see that's what we are so much closer because we're not married right now like I said Mary became part of the Bride she became part of the sea but she didn't have anything to do with that the first part that's right she did have something to do with the second part right same way with you and I you can't you and I can't deal and worry with what got this here amen somebody stand up and tell me you had one thing to do with getting here yeah your Mom and Daddy really didn't have anything with getting you here because everybody understands what goes on in the in the conception part but you know what this is the way I understand God it's okay going to be anyway um if I was God and you then how many children if you how many children you got three if you knew before the before you were even before you were just a little girl I mean you were just a baby I'm gonna have three kids and they're gonna be whoever you got right now and brother dick says okay that's fine we you know they meet and brother dick says well we're gonna have three kids that's the way God is you can't go in god you can't because remember the seed of the word is what comes predestinated eternally right you can't go into the body of God and go well where's Brother Dean was right here he was that little spot right here in the back no you can't do that Josh was a part of me when I was a baby yeah right amen let's just take a natural story just for a minute everybody okay you're not sleepy I know people not sleeping I'm over here in your face but um maybe you want to do this more days but preach on him but but look Josh was it that very person look let's be real that gray person right here was inside of me when I was born right right it's flesh who he is his DNA strain was in me when I was a baby when I brought that could you take and do some kind of anatomy and inspection and go on where was Josh no he was he was in my DNA makeup right but now we know what happened the 16 elements I ate it it became me it became blood blood become compressed and become sperm then we know what happened then here come Josh but now did I know exactly where he was at any time in my body Yeti was there that's right you can't deny it because there is right he looks like me plus his heart but he's got my DNA makeup he's supposed to look like me he's not supposed to look like brother Rick thank you you know I mean really so what about God put him out gone could you find that seed or word could you find that anywhere thank you but you were there amen and what that attribute right exactly you were in that attribute the word of God is a seed right right the word is a seed so you were there it's the seed or word that was predestinated then just like I said before when you got here as a human you responded to that part exactly and then what did God do he took part of his own life his DNA makeup because I believe God's a human being right he took his DNA strain and said there's my daughter just like brother dick and sister Gail could have done if they'd have known if they would have been you know if they knew eternity they know how many kids it's going to have right right that's Eternal he knew how many kids he's gonna have because they were inside of it not in a spot I've seen preachers try to draw spots y'all have two you know I was right no God is the word which is a Living Word and what he was when I was walking around I didn't wonder where I was going to get my kids from I knew where they was going to come from but see we all come through sexual desire but when you're born again you come to spoken word desires amen what the desire that you had for the word amen you desired your husband yes and he made you a child and now we can understand the Redemption of the body right because it's not somewhere we got to go get exactly it's right here it's now everybody who's going to make it I am man that's right that's all you got to say who's gonna make it I am it's not going to be me flesh me you looking at it's going to be the one inside of me amen that about 11 years 11 years ago I gave my heart to the Lord I made mistakes on the way but you know what if he'd have looked at all of Abraham's mistakes I mean this guy was a father of our faith yeah and he didn't just laugh at God inside like you know you know Sarah just said me and my husband have fun again you know no the Bible says Abraham got down on the ground and laughed in front of God right right he gave his wife away twice don't ever try that once he gave it but he did he tried to give her away twice that's right but yet when Paul wrote about him he said he was strong right in faith never wavering and he was the father of our faith why because he saw that baby and it didn't matter sister Anna what happened during that Journey didn't matter there was a glass standing away for Dave from David there was a spot and I'm gonna tell you something people let's see him we gotta find that we don't have to find that spot we know where the spot is we know what's in the word of God but we've got to believe that we can get there yes right Abraham believed he could get there amen Gloria Abraham the whole difference in Abraham and the rest of them was he believed that he was going to have that son did not matter did he you know what Abraham was a hundred years old when God changed his body right now and all of you know him nobody's made a hundred yet some of you getting close but do you really want kids when you're that old even in Abraham's Humanity it's like gee but no you know what Abraham said I'm going to have that child it does not matter if I'm 190. because God promised it right so here's the baby brother Brown said he's had the baby it's like he had it in his arms Gloria so what happened was he he did not he did not and Paul did not account the Journey of Abraham right against him exactly he's not going to count your journey against you if you see the Promise now if you don't say the promise and you you're doing this through your journey now God's not going to count that to you but when you have a spot you've got to get to and you know you're getting there and you know what's happening to you all right I can't make it happen to brother Aaron he's going to make it happen to himself but God's Made A Way amen God's Made A Way Gloria let's sing a song you love the Lord okay come around here we're standing on Holy Ground and Holy Mountain was God on the mountain made the mountain holy where's her holy it's what I said about being confident being arrogant you be arrogant and you'd be in bad shape but we must have confidence that God has given us the ability now to make this thing to the very end amen I believe 100 I believe this new prophets are alive taking changes in the bodies alive oh all right foreign at this stage going away Peter and them you know were walking to the gate beautiful and describing you know what happened to them and then people being healed in their Shadow and I kind of felt a little chat you can do that while you're preaching don't worry perhaps all of us but listen how do you know that hadn't happened amen sorry I didn't mean to say that I mean I'm really sorry honestly I thought I shouldn't have said that because we don't know it could have happened that's right you never know that you never know because the same God is there is here now and he's more in manifestation now than he was then see that's why we have to leave a clean life we have to ask God to forgive us daily that's right you know if you don't then I want to come live with you for a day or two I'll sure make you repent of something but you know what he's put people there to try you but we must be confident in what God has made us people arrogance is of the devil if you think you're better than somebody else no no but it's he that has made us yes not we ourselves when I was born in this world in this natural world I didn't have anything to do with it but God knew that when I come to the age I'm sorry that it was so long that I would want him more than life itself amen now he would do that he'd do the same thing for you right but you gotta want it right you gotta want it you gotta want more God more than anything in this natural world tonight okay let's say 369 I'll Fly Away cause I had already wrote that song later join the Lord be with you I am my way
