[10:59] see hey man good me in the house the
[11:05] Lord Easter resurrection he's alive and
[11:10] well that's a good song we can sing
[11:14] after the service is over we got it in
[11:16] there he's alive and well man look how
[11:19] the Lord works or how we talk good to be
[11:23] in the house of the Lord turn around
[11:24] shake somebody's hand and say god bless
[11:26] you thank you for overcoming and getting
[11:29] the church so you can see us god bless
[11:32] you buddy love you
[11:33] appreciate you hey man you enjoy that
[11:37] this morning that was good something
[11:40] else about that too we talked about the
[11:43] locust the pummel worm can't go where
[11:44] worm and and the caterpillar we we know
[11:48] that's the for death bugs but we've been
[11:51] talking about the for life the for life
[11:53] guys so we are kind of meshing all this
[11:57] thing together so good to be in the
[11:58] house of the Lord we got your Bibles
[11:59] let's turn back to the Book of
[12:02] Revelations chapter 6 we'll finish up
[12:05] today this will be thunder part 2 I hope
[12:09] you enjoyed last Sunday that was just an
[12:12] eye-opener to me every time that we that
[12:14] we study the Word of God and it should
[12:15] be should be something to where we can
[12:17] see from Genesis to Revelation and be
[12:20] able to like brother Owen said 1 Selah
[12:22] kind of the entire Bible together and
[12:24] the reason we've seen about this
[12:27] yesterday and some this morning I don't
[12:30] think will be so long on seal 2 3 4 5 6
[12:32] and 7 but seal one to me if you don't
[12:36] get on the right track
[12:37] it's like brother Lewis is coming out
[12:39] this morning brother Lewis not Lewis
[12:42] brother Lewis this morning about the and
[12:45] I really like that because remember in
[12:47] Daniel those Fork those kingdoms that
[12:51] were built that image that was built in
[12:52] Daniels started with a head of gold down
[12:56] to the feet
[12:57] i Staton right but God always starts at
[13:03] the foundation he starts at two feet
[13:05] gives you a good firm foundation then he
[13:08] builds up because what happens with that
[13:10] stone that stone doesn't roll down and
[13:12] hit the image in the head it hits him
[13:16] right down there where he has no
[13:17] foundation he hits him in that iron and
[13:20] clay which is the two softest metals of
[13:22] the whole thing so but to me that just
[13:25] brings the word back alive you know more
[13:27] and more as as we read this thing that
[13:29] it it brings us to a realization that is
[13:34] thinking about this just a few minutes
[13:35] ago we're the right people in the right
[13:39] place at the right time and man we're
[13:43] the right people at the right place at
[13:45] the right time so now something can
[13:47] happen now they you know it's been in
[13:50] the ages as like brother Dale saying
[13:53] they were and I read a quote where
[13:56] brother BAM said you know Wesley went so
[13:58] far
[13:59] Luther went so far denominated and died
[14:02] Wesley went so far denominating died
[14:04] every time you had somebody come up they
[14:06] denominated and died but this word here
[14:09] that we had cannot be denominated it
[14:12] will not be denominated sure they're
[14:14] making it everything in the book but it
[14:17] will not be denominated into a church
[14:23] like a Baptist or Methodist or anything
[14:24] like that where they say well this is it
[14:25] and then that's the way it is I'm gonna
[14:27] let God say this is it I'm all that God
[14:31] say that this is the right people at the
[14:33] right place at the right time and man it
[14:38] wasn't that way it has never been that
[14:40] way since Jesus was here he didn't have
[14:43] the right people on work at the right
[14:45] time no he didn't he didn't complete his
[14:49] kingdom amen we were the completion of
[14:53] the kingdom he was the head that got
[14:56] lost and then now if the heads come by
[14:59] then he's standing here just like he was
[15:01] by 2,000 years ago amen
[15:04] so let's turn to revelation 6 verse 1
[15:06] this will be the ending up of the first
[15:10] seal
[15:12] just pray for us next week I'll get a
[15:14] little I get double duty next Sunday so
[15:17] I can get on the second sail pretty
[15:18] quick and hope you enjoyed the first
[15:21] seal I have really enjoyed it myself
[15:23] showing a lot of things that we can look
[15:25] at that that we haven't seen before and
[15:28] I think that's the way it should be
[15:30] amen brother Dale preached this in 1984
[15:34] so it's not new to him but I'm sure
[15:35] these other things opened up since then
[15:38] till now that have that have helped it
[15:41] to enhance it just a little bit more a
[15:43] man not change the revelation but just
[15:46] to add to because those are adds add to
[15:49] your faith virtue add to your faith
[15:52] knowledge all right so now revelation 6
[15:54] verse 1 let's bow our heads to Heavenly
[15:57] Father we pray that you'd be with the
[15:58] people today father as an active
[16:01] participant in this service you do the
[16:03] speaking you do the healing you Lord
[16:06] give us understanding because that's
[16:07] what we crave in this hour we crave
[16:10] understanding and revelation more than
[16:11] anything Lord all the things of life are
[16:14] good and okay jobs and money and horses
[16:17] and cows and bees and all the other
[16:20] things are okay but Lord you're the most
[16:21] important thing because without you all
[16:24] that's just going to pass away one day
[16:25] but your word will never pass away and
[16:28] you said you'd be here in your word the
[16:30] Word made flesh again in the end time
[16:32] and so I believe Lord that you're here
[16:35] as much as you were 2,000 years ago even
[16:38] now more in a multiple form because you
[16:40] said greater works will we do when you
[16:43] come back in a bride bless this day
[16:47] father thank you for this Easter time of
[16:50] Resurrection and looking outside and the
[16:52] things are blooming and or maybe we have
[16:55] a resurrection in our heart today that
[16:57] will see you Father and not look at the
[17:01] circumstances that's our problem is
[17:04] circumstances does not look at
[17:06] circumstances don't fear anything little
[17:09] bride because God is on the scene to
[17:11] take care of everything for us father
[17:13] forgive us of our sin bless this day
[17:15] take care of us be with the ones are on
[17:17] the highway there's many of them out
[17:18] today Lord for different things
[17:21] traveling be with them Lord on their way
[17:23] home
[17:25] strength Lord to get back home and and
[17:28] be with us again next week father we
[17:30] asked you just bless us be with the
[17:32] missionaries on the foreign fields
[17:33] people brother royal there with this
[17:35] easter service coming today father that
[17:38] you'd just be with him take care of him
[17:40] be with that church they're building
[17:41] there and at Mount Pinatubo that you'd
[17:43] just bless them father be with those
[17:44] people forgive us of our sins and many
[17:47] mistakes Lord we pray in Jesus name Amen
[17:51] got a report back from that they haven't
[17:53] finished a church we gave them the rest
[17:55] of the money to finish the church and
[17:56] some wasn't able to go we went ahead and
[17:58] sent the money for them to pretty much
[17:59] finish it they're going to dedicate it
[18:01] May the 30th but brother or else sent me
[18:03] I'm email just a few days ago that
[18:06] they're going to baptize I think this is
[18:08] right they're gonna baptize over a
[18:09] hundred people that's already lined up
[18:11] to be baptized they're going to dedicate
[18:13] over a hundred babies they've been busy
[18:16] they go they're going to do several
[18:20] other things and dedicate that building
[18:22] on May the 30th so so you know it and if
[18:25] that if that just one little thing helps
[18:27] then you did it you help those people
[18:29] get a safe place to stay and to have
[18:31] church service in a building so thank
[18:34] God for that
[18:35] so revelation 6 verse 1 and I saw when
[18:37] the lamb opened one of the seals I heard
[18:39] as it were the noise of thunder one of
[18:41] the four beasts saying come and see
[18:43] I saw him behold a white horse and he
[18:45] that sat on him had a bow and a crown
[18:47] was given unto him he went forth
[18:48] conquering and to conquer keep those two
[18:51] words conquering and to conquer because
[18:52] I want to bring something to you in just
[18:54] a few minutes you may be seated in the
[18:56] Lord at his blessing to the reading of
[18:57] the word but we're satisfied one thing's
[19:05] for sure like I said before we'll read
[19:08] it in just a little while there brother
[19:10] Branham when he was preaching the
[19:12] greatest sermon of his life he was
[19:15] preaching to people that probably wasn't
[19:17] even born yet
[19:18] for the culmination oh hey sister Jeanne
[19:21] Lord good to see you today good to see
[19:25] you she told me the other day today in
[19:28] the hallway she said you made it man I
[19:29] said no she said you haven't insulted
[19:30] men weeks I said today is not over with
[19:33] you
[19:33] I don't insult you I just pick on you
[19:39] sister and genie and I'm brother Larry
[19:41] we go back a long way they were they
[19:45] were a very I say this from my point of
[19:49] view they were a very wonderful family
[19:50] to be around when we first began the
[19:52] message because they believed the
[19:54] message what no junk when no playing
[19:57] they believed the message and that
[19:58] really was a we had you know went away
[20:02] fellowship wise to other places but but
[20:04] that foundation is always there so
[20:06] complement to you not a condemnation he
[20:09] it was good to be around a family that
[20:12] whole family there that that really
[20:15] helped with the Word of God amen
[20:16] it's good to have that first part of
[20:18] your of your journey same way with
[20:19] anybody growing up in Christianity
[20:21] that's why I tell people when you become
[20:23] a Christian get around Christian you
[20:26] will get around Christians if you become
[20:28] a real Christian because you don't want
[20:30] you know what are you gonna talk about
[20:31] hey how you gonna go back and you know
[20:35] I've been born again now since 1998 how
[20:38] can I go back to those people I run
[20:39] within the world and even have enough
[20:41] you can even have a hey how you doing
[20:44] conversation almost much less them our
[20:46] conversation our mindset would be
[20:48] totally different
[20:49] the man same with you you shake your
[20:51] head you know that's the truth you just
[20:53] can't talk their language well we talk a
[20:55] language that when Jesus walked on earth
[20:57] he spoke a language that nobody had ever
[21:00] understood and really up until today
[21:03] nobody has understood that language but
[21:06] now I believe by the voice of God
[21:09] speaking through a prophet to us that we
[21:13] now really hear the true voice of God
[21:17] the true trumpet the truth Thunder every
[21:20] what you want to call it we hear that in
[21:23] its totality because Martin Luther when
[21:27] when God said to just shall live by
[21:28] faith and said Martin Luther this is
[21:30] your message God was happy for Martin
[21:32] Luther to have that message and then
[21:34] extremely happy because he was the only
[21:37] one he picked in that age to bring that
[21:39] message and put a bride away right amen
[21:45] then another one came up but he will
[21:47] happy with that but now God was happy
[21:49] with that but just like I told you about
[21:51] the the analogy of the beekeeping some
[21:53] of you said they really enjoyed that
[21:54] Ryan sent me a pretty good a little
[21:57] email after church but you know some
[21:59] people are happy just having a couple of
[22:01] beehives um some people just happy being
[22:03] a Christian but you know I've always
[22:05] wanted more I've always wanted there's
[22:08] more of a I believe that that we see the
[22:11] first pull and we see it it was a pull
[22:14] that brought people's attention amen
[22:18] first pull second pull but now that
[22:21] third pull
[22:21] it can't be imitated it has to be the
[22:25] Word of God and it has to be somebody to
[22:27] respond to the pull and then because the
[22:30] first pull in second the people that
[22:32] came under those first pull in second
[22:34] pull they as soon as the Prophet left
[22:36] they went off back into denominations
[22:38] and I'm not saying they weren't
[22:39] Christians they just didn't see the
[22:41] light of what he was bringing but now
[22:43] when he said that third pole would not
[22:45] be imitated and it would not be a public
[22:48] show then it's got to be to a group of
[22:50] people that understand and listen we
[22:54] become a part of that pull a man just
[22:57] for us being on the earth the pull of
[23:00] all Christians should be let's get out
[23:03] of here
[23:03] that's the pull of all Christian not
[23:06] that we're good well we'll be around
[23:07] here in those thirty years uh you know
[23:09] my grandkids probably see Lord coming
[23:13] you better hope that because there's a
[23:17] death in between there somewhere right
[23:19] so let's just pray that God has got the
[23:21] right people on the earth the right
[23:23] message the right people to bring that
[23:26] message and we'll read it today where
[23:27] the prophet of God will tell us exactly
[23:30] what he wanted to see and he called it a
[23:33] thunder we're talking about the thunders
[23:35] but let's kind of go through now and
[23:37] start back at the beginning kind of got
[23:40] off my message a little last Sunday but
[23:41] let's pull up Redemption Redemption
[23:44] Redemption we still got to put that
[23:47] Redemption Redemption Redemption this is
[23:50] the breaking of the seals is not
[23:52] necessarily for your soul your soul is
[23:55] redeemed by the new birth by what Christ
[23:57] did at Calvary two days ago 2,000 years
[23:59] ago
[24:00] resurrected came back in a group of
[24:02] people Peter didn't jump up and say
[24:05] thank God for the first seal there
[24:09] wasn't one right his buddy John was
[24:14] there right
[24:16] John John not John the Baptist John the
[24:18] Revelator was in that hundred and twenty
[24:20] people he didn't jump up and say thank
[24:23] God for the first seal yet he was going
[24:27] to write about it several years later a
[24:28] man but they jumped up and said thank
[24:31] God for Jesus Christ they died at
[24:33] Calvary like brother Dale was saying
[24:35] this morning read that message that
[24:37] Peter Peter said that same Jesus that
[24:39] you crucified he pulled it right out of
[24:43] Matt three thousand he said you put him
[24:45] on a cross
[24:46] in other words he was saying - I put him
[24:48] on the cross he said has now become Lord
[24:52] what Lord he was saying he was Lord him
[24:54] of his life a man has not become Lord
[24:57] Jesus Christ that's why I told him he
[25:00] said repent and be baptized in the name
[25:02] of my Lord amen so what a powerful one
[25:06] message that that Peter brought that day
[25:08] but you know what he knew what he was
[25:10] talking about that's the whole thing he
[25:13] knew what he was talking about that's
[25:15] what you and I must do we might like to
[25:17] talk to people that know what they're
[25:19] talking about there's some people you
[25:20] can talk to for hours and you know know
[25:23] more than you did when you first started
[25:25] and then but now they some people that
[25:29] in 15 minutes can give you a good
[25:31] revelation amen because it's what you
[25:33] know from a revelation not from just
[25:39] your head knowledge but what we're
[25:42] looking at now is since we are born
[25:44] again since we are part of the family of
[25:47] God like brother Dale said this is
[25:48] something different it's something
[25:49] higher it's something even this this is
[25:53] not we're all all Christians start here
[25:55] but all Christians don't end up here the
[26:00] little three beekeeper woman likes to
[26:01] stay right here but you know you state
[26:04] you take the same principle and you get
[26:07] you know fifteen thousand hives out of
[26:09] the same three that she had but what you
[26:11] just what you just like brother Dan said
[26:13] you just
[26:13] cut you keep reading you keep studying
[26:15] you keep put yourself before God and let
[26:18] him take you up through that because
[26:20] look you can climb up that ladder
[26:21] brother I've seen you climb up that
[26:22] ladder and he said if you climb up it he
[26:26] said oh you get up here and he said
[26:28] right reach that's your perfect man you
[26:30] get up so high and if it's not God
[26:32] somebody hits you not shout somebody
[26:34] takes a little temperance that's why
[26:39] don't we always go to temper everybody
[26:42] we always go on our temperance
[26:43] temperance temperance why because we're
[26:45] all humans somebody say something to
[26:48] about your to you you know a little
[26:49] cross and you do get a little upset a
[26:51] man a man you do get a little upset but
[26:56] it's how you control it a man don't
[26:58] cultivate it
[26:59] but these seals to me will bring back
[27:03] full fellowship just like Adam now look
[27:06] if the new birth brings you back into
[27:09] that condition like brother Lewis or
[27:12] brother Dale one read the quote I know
[27:14] Elyse talked about this morning where
[27:15] when you get the new birth you're back
[27:17] into that condition like Adam was before
[27:20] the fall you're a son of God God is
[27:23] residing in your soul and then but what
[27:26] happened to Adam he didn't go on and he
[27:29] cut his fellowship off because of what
[27:32] iniquity that's what we're talking about
[27:34] the first thing we've been talking about
[27:36] is this mystery of iniquity all right
[27:40] now remember the first seal though it
[27:42] tells us when we start this seal and we
[27:45] start bringing it up and you don't have
[27:46] to bring up number one but you can bring
[27:47] up the mystery of iniquity for the
[27:49] mystery of iniquity doth already work
[27:51] only he who now letteth will let until
[27:55] he be taken out of the way so remember
[27:59] if the eternal Word of God then you say
[28:01] well that was Paul and then in under we
[28:02] didn't we understand the mystery of
[28:04] iniquity is right here because we are
[28:08] still here hey man
[28:10] but now but by Mercy and truth iniquity
[28:13] is purged so by by Mercy and truth
[28:16] iniquity is purged by the fear of the
[28:19] Lord men depart from evil and that's
[28:20] what we're looking at with this first
[28:21] seal we must see as I've said last
[28:24] Sunday we must see that yes there
[28:27] as a thunder but there had to be
[28:30] lightning behind it there had to be a
[28:32] light Jesus Christ when he struck the
[28:35] earth when they put him at Calvary the
[28:39] Bible said it thundered and then when
[28:42] when man I'm gonna move real slow today
[28:44] because Kern's running the running the I
[28:50] told him I was gonna give him a little
[28:52] bob and weave turns back they're going
[28:53] like here but when Jesus Christ is on
[28:57] Calvary what there was a life there
[28:59] that's why hundred it didn't thunder
[29:02] when John and Henry and Jim and Joe was
[29:05] crucified why there was no lightning
[29:08] behind it but Jesus Christ was eternal
[29:12] life coming from an eternal condition to
[29:15] a natural condition and giving his life
[29:19] in a natural condition so that you and I
[29:21] could be saved I don't believe it's quit
[29:28] Thunder I don't believe it's quit I
[29:31] think it's just under just keeps rolling
[29:33] they just keeps root but there has to be
[29:35] a life behind it up I got a quote here I
[29:37] may read it or I make pass over where
[29:39] brother Brown said a lot of thunder but
[29:43] no lightning okay you can get a lot of
[29:46] rumbling you can you throw some dynamite
[29:48] out in the yard and people will swear
[29:50] it's thundering no it's a piece of
[29:52] dynamite
[29:52] it's not the right thing but when you
[29:54] hear that crack up in the sky when you
[29:57] hear that when that white thing pops the
[30:00] ground like that and then you hear the
[30:02] boom boom boom
[30:03] you know something happened so mercy and
[30:06] truth in other words what am I saying
[30:07] I'm saying that whatever has been
[30:10] happening in the ages there's a time now
[30:13] to where every one of these scriptures
[30:15] there was a part that everybody
[30:17] fulfilled right but not you and me know
[30:23] when you come to the headstone now
[30:25] Christ was the head I don't like that
[30:29] word was that's like I once said before
[30:30] brother Branham was a prophet no he
[30:32] wasn't he still is so Jesus was the head
[30:36] no he still is the headstone hey man so
[30:39] being the headstone to the church
[30:40] if he's back now in power where is he
[30:45] hey man he's working through a group of
[30:49] people I'll read that to you in a minute
[30:54] but the mystery of iniquity we know
[30:57] where the seed of Satan is they didn't
[31:01] know it before and like I was thinking
[31:03] about my brother Dale was talking this
[31:04] morning
[31:05] the reason they didn't have a problem
[31:08] the reason they went to the faith of the
[31:09] father so quick listen they had no
[31:14] denomination to deal with
[31:16] they had no they had nobody standing up
[31:25] saying you're wrong
[31:27] you gotta follow me but now that
[31:29] happened later on now they come right
[31:31] after that but on the day of Pentecost
[31:34] when God came down into 120 group of
[31:37] people they weren't they weren't saddled
[31:41] or shackled by false doctrine amen
[31:45] oh sure Caiaphas and himself we got
[31:48] Moses you know we got his quote book
[31:51] trust what to say now yeah we got
[31:53] brother Graham we got this quote they
[31:54] got that quote got this quote they were
[31:58] looking at the quote book in flesh and
[32:00] turned him down that's why this message
[32:04] is not popular if Jesus wasn't popular
[32:07] you and I are not gonna be popular every
[32:09] characteristic little headstone had if
[32:11] he's back I'm asking you that not me if
[32:13] the headstone is back we gotta act the
[32:16] same way he did but like Louise send us
[32:21] what he was tempted in many points right
[32:24] but without saying now what difference
[32:27] does that mean you if you got the same
[32:28] man inside of you right come on now
[32:31] really you got the same man standing on
[32:34] earth they said who can't condemn me of
[32:39] sin you say who are you making yourself
[32:42] nobody God's the one that said I could
[32:45] do God's one that said I'm gonna come
[32:47] down I'm gonna burn that old you out I'm
[32:50] gonna enter in and we are gonna live on
[32:53] this earth
[32:56] we just came the wrong way hey man I saw
[33:01] this wrong we just came the wrong way so
[33:10] when the mystery of iniquity has been
[33:11] made history this lifetime you gonna
[33:13] hear me say this not when they Nick when
[33:15] the mystery of iniquity has made been
[33:17] made history it's when God reveals to
[33:20] you you than you that what I just said
[33:26] it's the truth amen
[33:32] Christ died to give us all this and it's
[33:37] not since not a second person or a third
[33:39] person it comes to you that same Jesus
[33:42] who you crucified I'm gonna tell you
[33:45] today that same Jesus who you crucified
[33:48] God has raised him up and made him why
[33:51] Lord Jesus Christ and the only Jesus
[33:56] Christ they're gonna see is who you so
[34:00] to me the mystery of iniquity it's done
[34:03] away with when you realize who you are
[34:06] that's why they first seal that's why
[34:08] that went in opened to me it's one of
[34:12] the most important seals if he did not
[34:14] open then we know we're in a room now
[34:17] we're in the room of eternity we're not
[34:21] in the room of denomination we're not in
[34:23] the room of Baptist thinking and
[34:25] Methodist preaching in Pentecostal
[34:27] preaching we're in a new room we're in a
[34:31] place called the eighth day we're in a
[34:33] place called the headstone sure the
[34:39] bride never was in a church age but you
[34:42] and I are know they called out people
[34:45] that's going to leave here and another
[34:48] Church age come to develop art to bring
[34:50] anything else then let's tell them this
[34:55] morning Sunday School
[34:57] we got an over coming in the first age
[35:01] he did overcometh in the second age he
[35:04] that overcometh in the third age to
[35:06] number seven do you know there's a
[35:08] oh you better read revelation when the
[35:13] new city comes down amen
[35:17] let's read it it's powerful revelation
[35:23] 21:1 don't pull it up and I saw a new
[35:25] heaven a new earth for the first heaven
[35:26] and the first earth passed away there
[35:27] was no more sea and I joined saw the
[35:29] holy city New Jerusalem coming down from
[35:31] God out of heaven prepared as a bride
[35:32] adorned for her husband sorry brother
[35:34] Hal I'm having to read a real fast verse
[35:36] 7 he that overcometh shall inherit all
[35:40] things no limitation that's your age
[35:45] that's because really the only time
[35:47] we're gonna be the whole world in its
[35:49] totality is gonna be in the 8th day is
[35:50] when when the new city comes down hey
[35:53] man hello even even even the millennium
[35:58] is going to be time white drones going
[36:00] to be time until the Battle of Gog and
[36:03] Magog land God doesn't just burn bodies
[36:05] up he kills souls
[36:09] hey man this first burning were fixing
[36:13] the gifts just going to put them in the
[36:15] 5th dimension the next one of Gog and
[36:19] Magog God's gonna reign his own fire and
[36:22] listen the soul that sinneth he said
[36:28] don't you fear the man that can kill
[36:31] your body he said you better fear that
[36:34] guy that can take your soul and do away
[36:37] with it there's only one and that's the
[36:40] Creator the one that created it can take
[36:43] care of it that's why if you are part of
[36:46] the Creator but if you're not he'll take
[36:57] care of that soul cause all them demons
[37:01] are gonna be done away in the gog and
[37:02] magog oh we not gonna have to worry
[37:05] about that in the new city no that's why
[37:07] that a twin right there I wrote in my
[37:09] Bible long time ago I wrote number eight
[37:11] with a star beside it he said verse six
[37:14] it is done I am Alpha and Omega the
[37:17] beginning in the end I will give unto
[37:19] him that's the thirsty fountain of the
[37:20] water of
[37:20] freely he that overcometh shall inherit
[37:22] all things and I will be his God and he
[37:26] shall be my son I see it that's number
[37:31] eight that just slides us right over
[37:33] into turn now listen you and I sprite
[37:34] window better than this we're gonna see
[37:37] ours here I write day comes right here
[37:40] into this dimension Amen because we get
[37:44] a body change here right now others
[37:47] don't have to wait you see what a
[37:50] Christian has got to look forward to I
[37:54] said many times before and even in this
[37:56] first seal the mystery of iniquity shows
[37:59] me that I don't have to go through
[38:01] judgment I'm judged with Christ and if
[38:08] mercy and truth purges and done away
[38:11] with your iniquity and God's only one
[38:13] that can forgive sins amen he's the only
[38:18] one because says I can't remember that
[38:20] no more never to bring you back up again
[38:24] hey man you know what we don't believe
[38:29] that somewhere we think maybe that'll
[38:33] all get see that's the fear part that
[38:35] Satan says I still remember but I was
[38:38] thinking the other day you know
[38:39] sometimes I'm like brother Dale I'm
[38:41] little carnal one day I thought man I
[38:43] thought God standing here in eternity
[38:44] you know he's standing here like this
[38:46] Satan walks up and he goes you see what
[38:49] they're doing I thought this was some
[38:52] kind of message is supposed to bring all
[38:53] these people to some kind of you said
[38:55] something kind of you gonna change their
[38:57] bodies or something
[38:58] Oh God you know doc God don't go Oh Lord
[39:01] boo you aren't ready it's true let me
[39:03] see what I wrote about that he just
[39:05] looked over at Satan said just wait a
[39:07] minute yeah just wait a minute just wait
[39:12] a minute because I got to have the right
[39:15] people in the right place at the right
[39:18] time and when I do you will have nothing
[39:21] to do with it hey man I love that to me
[39:27] that's what the seal show us for
[39:29] redemption the full plan not just to
[39:33] save my soul
[39:34] but to change my body to make my even my
[39:39] spirit realm turn back to where before
[39:42] the fall where my memory is not of me
[39:46] being a sinner we've read it before many
[39:55] times
[39:55] let's read it now we talked about
[39:58] justification burl Ernie was talking
[40:01] about a revelation of true justification
[40:03] now that doesn't mean there was a false
[40:04] justification but the true just like
[40:08] like the Bible says the faithful and
[40:09] true witness not that Jesus was false
[40:12] but it rained true everything he had was
[40:15] the truth
[40:16] but look being justified freely by His
[40:18] grace through the redemption that is in
[40:19] Christ whom God has set forth to be a
[40:21] perpetuation through faith in his blood
[40:23] to declare his righteousness for the
[40:25] remission of sins are passed never to be
[40:28] remembered again we dig them up
[40:31] Satan give us a shovel just hand it back
[40:35] to him cuz remember brother we say and I
[40:42] believe to when Jesus walked through the
[40:43] world there was things went through his
[40:46] mind just like those two hours he
[40:48] listened he lived with Mary Magdalene
[40:51] and all them now Mary Magdalene was a
[40:52] prostitute he probably saw some things
[40:55] you understand what I'm talking about
[40:56] that was running through his mind maybe
[40:59] he saw Mary a few times you understand
[41:01] what I'm saying but he never entered and
[41:05] remember what the prophet of God said he
[41:07] said Satan can't come to him he can't
[41:09] come to you jesus never stepped out in
[41:14] his field hey man he just watch he just
[41:20] said no now you and I we got a problem
[41:23] with that because we don't do that
[41:25] hello everybody we don't do that even in
[41:28] our Christian condition even in our
[41:32] Christian condition what are these for
[41:38] to show us how to handle these things
[41:41] amen
[41:42] now the seals combined with that too
[41:47] because the seals
[41:48] for the redemption of this guy which
[41:50] everybody since the beginning of time
[41:56] knew they were gonna have to die even
[42:00] job though the skin worms destroy this
[42:04] body in my flesh shall see God
[42:08] hey man he had a revelation but he also
[42:12] that revelation man he was gonna say
[42:15] master revelation you and I got a break
[42:20] listen we put everything listen this we
[42:25] put everything on that's dying on all
[42:28] these symptoms I'm getting older I feel
[42:31] worse are this that I don't feel good I
[42:35] don't that's the symptom that's the
[42:41] symptom that we cultivate in our head
[42:46] but now everywhere God said hey hey he
[42:50] didn't say now you gonna get sick and
[42:51] die right tell me in the Bible where
[42:55] Jesus said here you're dead meat you
[42:59] sorry you're a goner now every time he
[43:02] walked up and somebody was dead they got
[43:05] a body change
[43:06] hey man Lazarus definitely got a body
[43:10] change he's stuck his nose was sunk in
[43:15] see we think all this and I think a
[43:17] priest it's a long time ago about the
[43:20] great mystery of the body change my
[43:22] heaven Abraham totally had a body change
[43:27] amen
[43:28] Lazarus totally out-of-body change
[43:31] everybody was raised from the dead
[43:32] everybody change
[43:33] amen so the body change is not something
[43:36] new it just what happens is is this body
[43:40] change by the revelation the opening of
[43:42] the word is going to carry us right into
[43:44] eternity where Lazarus died again
[43:48] Abraham died again each one of them died
[43:51] again
[43:52] but you and I today if you're still
[43:55] breathing and sucking air you got a
[43:58] chance
[44:02] some of us suck it more than others but
[44:05] you got a chance because you know what
[44:07] we do we bring them things up right
[44:09] there that's what I've been thinking all
[44:11] week we but we bring those sins back up
[44:13] and we just want we just collect them
[44:15] back again through what through our
[44:19] memory we reason oh whoa I don't know if
[44:24] that come on now that's our problem
[44:29] because look what the prophet of God
[44:31] tells us invisible Union number two what
[44:34] he tell us he said you're standing
[44:38] completely you never see in the first
[44:40] place God don't even know it's in the
[44:43] sea of forgetfulness you never did it
[44:45] how positive you want me to say this a
[44:48] little bit more you were accused of it
[44:50] by the accuser like I said you know God
[44:53] and Satan standing then Satan is going
[44:54] you see what the Diddy's didn't sisson
[44:59] you see that no but now we're down in
[45:03] this dimension going yes I did it but
[45:07] would say forgive me Lord listen let's
[45:10] don't be above where we're not going
[45:11] we're gonna walk a sinless life hello
[45:14] brother Brown said this thing will be
[45:16] sticky until we get changed but he and
[45:19] say we couldn't overcome it he never
[45:21] said we can't overcome it he said it'll
[45:24] be sticky until the change
[45:25] he never said you're gonna be this I
[45:29] said zombie Louise Lisa's in the back
[45:34] you never did it you were accused of it
[45:37] but really from the beginning you were
[45:40] predestinated to be a son and daughter
[45:42] of God that Genesis 1:26 man way back
[45:45] you know what we say way back brother
[45:47] Brian it ain't God ain't a second older
[45:49] than when he spoke that so it's not back
[45:52] there to him it's present you know what
[45:55] he's going he's standing there though
[45:57] looking at us and he's going do you now
[45:59] believe ain't know what Jesus stood
[46:02] there one day and finally he said do you
[46:04] now believe do you now believe what I'm
[46:07] saying hey man so that's what God's been
[46:09] doing he said hey do you now believe
[46:11] I've already done the work
[46:12] I've already proclaimed I've already
[46:17] proclaimed in the first part of the book
[46:20] Genesis 1:26 before there was ever flesh
[46:23] that spit all over myself before there
[46:25] was anything he said you're standing
[46:29] sinless you can control nature you have
[46:33] complete control over this earth you're
[46:40] standing there washed and your whole
[46:43] book of divorcement is put away and it's
[46:44] dead now see remember you can't marry if
[46:48] you're divorced right but you can marry
[46:50] if your husband's dead
[46:51] so your husband's gotta be dead not
[46:54] divorced me and man you gotta be dead
[46:56] and when it's dead you know what you
[46:58] freedom and I saw brother brand the
[46:59] other day and I'll look it up again
[47:00] because it really it's not exactly this
[47:03] way but he said if your husband dies
[47:05] you're just a virgin to the next man in
[47:07] other words if you're if you do what to
[47:09] Bible what God said in the word if your
[47:11] husband dies you're just as true a
[47:13] virgin to the next man you marry Wow how
[47:16] about that but that's the truth how you
[47:18] going to ever marry again cuz you call
[47:20] them a virgin I'm just telling you that
[47:23] I'm not doing marriage and divorce thing
[47:25] here today okay don't ruin all the but
[47:26] we're out the back of the rim absolutely
[47:29] out of existence even in the mind of God
[47:30] so it's not even in the mind of God so
[47:35] remember he's not thinking about our
[47:39] sins one day he and I love the quote I
[47:43] don't believe it was something somebody
[47:44] maybe been Dwight Moody said God is
[47:46] never going to come to the end and ask
[47:48] you what took you so long
[47:50] to be a Christian now right
[47:54] he knew how long oh he's going to say
[47:57] his enter into the joy of the Lord
[47:59] created to you what before the
[48:03] foundation of the world
[48:04] Amen it gives us confidence to live in
[48:11] this world it gives us confidence the
[48:13] Word of God does nothing else does you
[48:16] can read all these other books if you
[48:17] want to you can't put confidence in them
[48:20] because you know what in about five
[48:21] years some other person is gonna write a
[48:24] book
[48:25] that's gonna be against that book that
[48:26] you said that books right you remember
[48:30] all the things when they told us that
[48:31] eggs we're bad for you
[48:34] eggs bad for you give you cholesterol
[48:37] you know you and then they come out with
[48:39] one time they said well you don't have
[48:40] to refrigerate them now you do have to
[48:42] refrigerate them now eggs are good for
[48:44] you somebody on the egg board must've
[48:46] stuck in some money and said how about
[48:48] telling people eggs are kind of good for
[48:50] you you say what I'm saying but God
[48:52] never done God never say well I'll put
[48:53] that in there and say now that ain't
[48:54] gonna work for you let me take it out
[48:55] put another thing in now what he said is
[48:58] done we just got to go by the plan amen
[49:03] and he didn't have a plan right you know
[49:09] what if God didn't have a plan we
[49:10] couldn't understand him because we're
[49:13] humans we're lambs we need a plan we
[49:17] need a plan
[49:19] we need somebody tell us this is what's
[49:21] gonna happen
[49:22] amen that's just where I am Garside GPS
[49:29] way before GPS came in
[49:31] that's God's positioning system our gods
[49:37] predestinate seat it'll always land
[49:39] where it's supposed to they won't be
[49:41] none of this recalculating in God's in
[49:43] God show no no he don't recalculate
[49:47] that's what they mow tom-toms used to
[49:50] tell us the recalculating
[49:52] then you'd drive about thirty feet past
[49:54] it make a u-turn and go back not God's
[49:59] he is precise his GPS always will work
[50:03] he's always had wireless connection he's
[50:04] never needed a wire to connect to
[50:06] anybody so all that stuff that we're
[50:07] looking at now is is not something new
[50:09] no no God's been Wireless forever he's
[50:12] never had to plug in anything nope amen
[50:15] I'm not gonna charge you for that one
[50:16] one God all right let's get through this
[50:19] and God spake these words saying I am
[50:21] THE LORD thy God now look he thundered
[50:23] from heaven on Mount Sinai thundering
[50:28] lightning come to Mount Sinai remember
[50:30] the whole but man it was just all on
[50:33] fire and everything else what was he
[50:35] doing he was talking to his
[50:37] it was talking to Moses said you'll have
[50:39] no other God before me don't try it
[50:43] but they did amen
[50:47] that was a problem with Israel they said
[50:50] o Moses you go up and get it for us and
[50:53] we'll do whatever you say
[50:56] they lied they lied to begin with they
[51:01] started murmuring the minute he was gone
[51:03] and plural Aaron the prophet of the hour
[51:07] he got a bad revelation he said Moses
[51:10] that thing just popped out of the fire
[51:15] that's what he's saying I'm telling you
[51:17] that guy says and Moses that thing's
[51:18] gonna pop right out of fire and I'm sure
[51:20] Moses was like brother come back here
[51:24] give her a minute I won't take you
[51:26] behind the tent no one told you for just
[51:28] a minute no it made Moses mad and he
[51:31] throwed them plates down and started
[51:33] over again first seal number three they
[51:40] said now here's a white horse and white
[51:42] horses the power of charger man who sat
[51:44] on him was white horse with the Holy
[51:46] Ghost he's talking about now this is
[51:47] their revelation fourth in the early
[51:49] ages conquering that age for the kingdom
[51:51] of God he had to bow in his hand which
[51:52] meant like Cupid he shot the arrows of
[51:54] love into the hearts of the people the
[51:56] love of God and he conquered now that
[51:58] sounds very good but it isn't the truth
[52:00] no sir that isn't why it does mean
[52:03] righteous know we talked about the law
[52:05] of contrasts and put it on the board
[52:07] where there was a white righteous church
[52:09] on earth a man that wrote in those first
[52:12] three ages that's why the the people
[52:14] under day of Pentecost that was a white
[52:15] righteous church God was riding through
[52:19] those people hey man no false doctrine
[52:22] but Satan went in late I think I'll go
[52:25] down to the bar room and see if I can
[52:26] get me a bunch of pro-prosecution
[52:28] and drunks and that will know he said I
[52:31] like this because Satan remember Satan's
[52:34] a spiritual guy we got to remember one
[52:36] thing
[52:36] Satan is the most anointed person beside
[52:39] God amen
[52:41] so when he fills in an Ordnung he just
[52:43] goes I think oh uh move on in here get a
[52:48] little closer but then get look close
[52:51] right right but what exposes him the
[52:56] Word of God right here that horse rider
[53:00] rode all the way to march of 1963 when a
[53:11] prophet came on the scene and God said
[53:14] I've had enough I've had enough of this
[53:17] I'm fixing to bring your truth I'm
[53:21] fixing to bring you wanted to brother up
[53:23] stand there and say this is the greatest
[53:24] of my ministry is right now right why he
[53:29] knew that he was bringing all those
[53:32] doctrines right back to where they
[53:34] should be
[53:34] kicked over into the pits of hell and
[53:36] breath the right brought the right truth
[53:39] to the people see that's why when that
[53:43] first Hill opened that's why it's under
[53:45] we're reading just a minute realizing
[53:48] what means righteous the teachers taught
[53:49] us it was the Holy Spirit conquer in the
[53:51] first stage but the revelation by the
[53:53] Holy Spirit is not that way my
[53:54] revelation about Holy Spirit is Christ
[53:56] and the Holy Ghost is the same person
[53:58] and that one true Living God only in a
[54:02] different form so here stands Christ the
[54:04] lamb we know he was the lamb he's
[54:07] standing here with the books in his hand
[54:09] and there goes the white horse rider
[54:11] so remember brother Brown said when you
[54:12] see two people show up there's not Jesus
[54:17] in God
[54:17] sorry Mormons I'll call it out like it
[54:21] is sorry Mormons it wasn't Jesus and God
[54:24] came to John Smith or Joseph Smith hello
[54:28] hey I've read their book I've had to
[54:31] Mormons y'all told you the story I had
[54:32] two that were my secretaries they told
[54:33] me the whole thing Jesus and God appears
[54:36] to this person Mariah or whoever it is
[54:38] and when you know it's a lie to begin
[54:42] with that's a lot of begin with so you
[54:44] know what I don't have to read that amen
[54:49] they've changed it 1,500 times anyway so
[54:52] why would I read it I don't have to read
[54:53] it again you read this Bible one time
[54:55] and if you pick it up 40 years later
[54:56] you've got a really different amen
[55:01] it will never change face final resting
[55:06] place I love that what brother Brown
[55:07] said face final resting places in the
[55:09] Word of God so look my revelation only
[55:13] in a different form same person so here
[55:16] stands Christ the Lamb we know it was
[55:17] the Lamb me standing here with the book
[55:18] in his hand there goes two white horse
[55:19] rider so it wasn't the Holy Spirit in
[55:22] other words we wanted to take a person
[55:24] or a third person it was the person of
[55:26] God amen
[55:27] number four watch what he's saying to
[55:32] watch you breathe he said look
[55:32] trinitarianism is of the devil I say
[55:35] that that's at the Lord so you can
[55:36] forget everything else you won't do that
[55:38] was the voice of God telling me that
[55:41] trinitarianism is of the devil look
[55:43] where he come from they come from Nicean
[55:45] Council we talked about last week we're
[55:48] reading again when the Catholic Church
[55:49] becoming the rulership the word Trinity
[55:51] is not even mentioned in the entire book
[55:53] of the Bible and as far as three guards
[55:55] that's from Hell so where's this wild
[55:58] horse rider come from hell memory don't
[56:03] he don't have a name to the third to the
[56:06] third seal but his name always was death
[56:08] in other words there was a revelation
[56:11] there's one God that's exactly right now
[56:15] do you say well do you believe that all
[56:16] these people that trinitario of hell no
[56:18] sir I believe they're Christians God
[56:22] winked at their ignorance but watch that
[56:24] last quote but the hour is approaching
[56:27] brother were they are sincerely wrong
[56:31] amen look that comes a time brothers and
[56:37] sisters look it comes to an absolute
[56:41] sharp point and that's where we're at
[56:43] we're at that sharp point where that
[56:47] people can be sincere but they
[56:49] absolutely can be sincerely wrong
[56:54] revelations 2 verse 4 I want you to look
[56:59] real quick here

[57:08] gonna cut through it and read it a
[57:09] little bit faster nevertheless I have
[57:11] somewhat against thee because thou has
[57:13] left thy first love nice it's the first
[57:14] church age this is the fusion church age
[57:18] that's powerful big powerful church but
[57:20] watch nevertheless I have somewhat
[57:22] against they become has left thy first
[57:23] love remember therefore from whence thou
[57:26] art fallen and repent that's pretty
[57:32] simple but you got to know where you
[57:35] fell to me that's what these seals are
[57:38] not to tell me that my soul ISM is bad
[57:41] if this already redeemed I don't say
[57:44] forget about it but let push that back
[57:46] my spirit realm is where I got a lot of
[57:48] problems and then not my flesh that
[57:52] middle guy and if we keep remember
[57:59] therefore from whence thou art fallen
[58:00] and repent and do the first works do
[58:03] what I told you to begin with listen if
[58:08] I told you to have dominion over the
[58:11] fish of the sea in the foul the air
[58:13] that's what I want you to get back to
[58:16] it's all down here where I got a quote
[58:19] hang on a minute
[58:21] but this thou hast that they'll hate us
[58:24] now look the first age they hated the
[58:27] deeds of the Nicolaitans what is Niko
[58:29] laughing brother branson niko is what
[58:31] conquered the laity all right which i
[58:33] also hate now when god hates something
[58:36] he can't change his mind and say later
[58:38] on no i made a mistake
[58:39] cuz you now do the same thing like i you
[58:42] know but now lemon pie hate lemon pie
[58:44] sorry i just hate it and I'll hate it
[58:46] tomorrow but I've said things I hated
[58:47] that I didn't hate anymore alive but God
[58:49] can't do that gunk and say I hated it
[58:51] no I think I like him no he can't do
[58:53] that thank God we can go back to that
[58:56] though if he hated it then he hated it
[59:00] now and he hated it before the
[59:02] foundation of the world
[59:04] alright next please revelations 2 verse
[59:08] 12 now look I skip the pergamus because
[59:12] watch it took three ages that wild horse
[59:15] rider riding through
[59:17] the righteous people amen the Devils
[59:22] riding right there with them and to the
[59:24] Angel of Church of Pergamos which is
[59:26] your last year Third Age these things
[59:28] saith he which has two sharp sword with
[59:29] two edges I know thy works and where
[59:32] thou dwellest even where Satan's seat is
[59:35] in other words the mystery of iniquity
[59:37] is history you ought to know where he's
[59:40] sitting that but watch and thou holdest
[59:43] fast my name now the third age they were
[59:45] still baptizing them Lord Jesus Christ
[59:47] alright and has not denied my faith even
[59:52] in those days wherein Antipas was my
[59:54] faithful martyr who was slain among you
[59:56] where Satan dwelleth but I have a few
[59:59] things against thee because thou hast
[1:00:01] there them what your men going with the
[1:00:05] wrong crowd not mongers and drunks
[1:00:11] your your mingling with the wrong crowd
[1:00:14] because thou hast there them that hold
[1:00:17] the doctrine of Balaam who taught Balak
[1:00:20] to cast a stumbling-block before the
[1:00:21] children of Israel to eat things
[1:00:22] sacrificed unto idols and commit
[1:00:24] fornication
[1:00:24] so hast thou also them in your
[1:00:28] congregation in your pulpit hello
[1:00:30] somebody so hostile also them that hold
[1:00:33] the doctrine now remember it was a deed
[1:00:36] now it's the doctrine they're preaching
[1:00:39] it it's doctrine folk this is the
[1:00:42] doctrine we're going to talk about now
[1:00:44] the doctor of the Nicolaitans which
[1:00:46] thing I hate he hated it from the
[1:00:49] beginning and he's still hating it now
[1:00:50] and then that all right say man it's
[1:00:55] truth anyhow all right now watch this
[1:01:00] I'm gonna bring this note there's
[1:01:02] nothing for you to pull up I just kind
[1:01:04] of sketch this down because look if you
[1:01:06] go the wild horse rider said what
[1:01:09] conquering and to conquer now this is
[1:01:11] nothing on here that I just wrote this
[1:01:12] down in here remember you went out
[1:01:15] conquering into what does conquer do
[1:01:19] divides conquering divides right hey man
[1:01:25] you got a divide to conquer anyway
[1:01:27] because you got to have opposing forces
[1:01:30] amen we're all Christians we shouldn't
[1:01:32] fight each other we don't have certain
[1:01:33] about doctrine but anyway anyway anyway
[1:01:35] anyway nevermind but remember when
[1:01:39] brother Dan was talking about in Joel
[1:01:40] you know what the locust does if we're
[1:01:45] gonna go locust pummel worm cankerworm
[1:01:47] caterpillar he read it this morning what
[1:01:51] does the locust do the first thing the
[1:01:53] locust does is what eats to leave
[1:01:57] brother Brown said took away their
[1:02:01] fellowship divide our I wrote join us
[1:02:07] don't join them over there
[1:02:09] join us hey man that's what he says
[1:02:13] though the locusts we're gonna take the
[1:02:15] locust pom wearing all those and you can
[1:02:16] fit them right into this and also
[1:02:18] remember what happened with Cain and
[1:02:21] Abel amen
[1:02:24] the seals the sails to me broke all the
[1:02:29] way through the Bible you just gotta
[1:02:30] have an understanding of that because in
[1:02:33] Genesis 4 what what what was the problem
[1:02:36] with Cain killing Abel opposing forces
[1:02:40] hey man Cain tried to put his doctrine
[1:02:45] over on Abel and Abel says I don't want
[1:02:48] having nothing to do with it but now
[1:02:50] Cain thought he was just as righteous as
[1:02:52] Abel think about that first that white
[1:02:53] righteous Church they thought they were
[1:02:55] right they did not start
[1:02:58] there's no denomination ever started
[1:03:01] said well we're going to nominate and
[1:03:02] we're gonna deceive these people we're
[1:03:04] gonna be wrong they never do that they
[1:03:08] create a denomination to say we're right
[1:03:10] Shane still thinks he's right hey man so
[1:03:16] here it is that thing is riding right
[1:03:18] through it started and I started
[1:03:20] actually when Michael Inc and Lucifer
[1:03:22] fall amen and he come all the way down
[1:03:25] through Cain and Abel and there was a
[1:03:27] division and what happened Cain killed
[1:03:28] Abel not because he didn't like his
[1:03:30] brother Abel wouldn't agree with him
[1:03:34] God accepted able and then iniquity was
[1:03:40] found in Cain's heart
[1:03:41] amen that Alright say man
[1:03:43] that's the truth now let's read here
[1:03:46] let's see now just for a few minutes we
[1:03:49] got all them brother Louie's you want
[1:03:52] that spell on me you put the lid about
[1:03:55] halfway on okay I'll get you some time
[1:03:59] later so now let's look let's pick up
[1:04:11] the thought of the Thunder again from
[1:04:14] watch 1954 nope not that one remember
[1:04:17] we're putting that we're putting out at
[1:04:19] the very end you didn't put that at the
[1:04:21] very end okay all right look
[1:04:24] what's this Lauer grace Jeffersonville
[1:04:26] Indiana this is 1954 and the justice of
[1:04:29] law required blood and the blood of
[1:04:31] sheep wouldn't do it now remember before
[1:04:33] we get started these thunders all seven
[1:04:36] thunders uttered under the first seal
[1:04:38] there was no other thunder sound on
[1:04:41] number two number three number four
[1:04:42] brother Rams they all opened on the
[1:04:43] first seal when I first you open you
[1:04:46] know boom boom boom boom boom boom
[1:04:49] alright that's why that first seals so
[1:04:52] important hey once you get me in gosh
[1:04:57] said once you let me in your heart now
[1:04:59] let me get in a little bit further

[1:05:10] can say god you can't go in that door
[1:05:12] right there

[1:05:15] the Holy Ghost was what a very timid
[1:05:16] person he will not override your free
[1:05:19] moral agency even as a Christian amen

[1:06:55] opened it it was there that lightning
[1:07:02] came and then that Thunder Here I am
[1:07:08] don't look for me in this one or this
[1:07:10] one or that one look for me right here
[1:07:13] this is where I'm at I'm in this message
[1:07:17] that this man is bringing he saw you put
[1:07:21] it all in one man just hang on a minute
[1:07:24] cuz watch this right here
[1:07:26] this will prove it one the blood of
[1:07:30] cattle wouldn't do it the blood of God
[1:07:31] himself had to do it
[1:07:34] remember do not do it forget Redemption
[1:07:37] the thunders have to be something that
[1:07:40] John was familiar with he was getting
[1:07:44] ready to ride him down he had no problem
[1:07:46] beginning to write them I was about to
[1:07:50] ride
[1:07:51] John was a born-again Christian standing
[1:07:53] on the earth with the Holy Ghost in his
[1:07:55] soul and God was showing him something
[1:07:59] and he said you lad what you see
[1:08:04] so in Revelations 10 comes down he said
[1:08:07] the seven thunders are the voice and I
[1:08:08] join began or started to write in other
[1:08:14] words he wasn't waiting he knew what he
[1:08:20] saw he knew what he saw and there's only
[1:08:24] one thing that we all have in common
[1:08:28] Redemption there's not one soul gonna go
[1:08:32] into eternity the Eternity that has not
[1:08:35] been redeemed not one nobody
[1:08:44] God was made flesh to live here on earth
[1:08:47] that great thundering person on top of
[1:08:51] Mount Sinai was here in flesh then then
[1:08:56] he cleansed the way well I love this
[1:08:58] then he cleansed away that he could come
[1:09:02] and live in your heart and now that same
[1:09:06] spirit that thundered from Mount Sinai
[1:09:09] is living in a human heart who's the
[1:09:14] Thunder what's the thunder let's keep
[1:09:19] reading no the next one what here's now
[1:09:24] Elijah 1959 this Angeles temple and we'd
[1:09:29] pass that this Angeles temple tonight
[1:09:31] would be packed out to the roof standing
[1:09:34] out yonder in the yard somewhere if we
[1:09:35] could only hear that voice of God
[1:09:37] speaking behind the thing remember those
[1:09:40] things went first the voice spoke last
[1:09:46] what he's saying about Mary he's talking
[1:09:48] to Elijah remember at Thunder the
[1:09:50] earthquake the lightning and all that
[1:09:51] but remember Elijah never moved till he
[1:09:54] heard the voice behind it hello we've
[1:10:01] had rushing winds and thunder and
[1:10:03] everything else but the hour is coming
[1:10:06] now that the voice of God speak and he
[1:10:09] proved that it's him it was him that
[1:10:12] sent the Thunder and they went after the
[1:10:15] Thunder instead of listening for the
[1:10:18] he sent the wind but they went after the
[1:10:21] wind instead of the boys that's the
[1:10:23] problem now we got a lot of wind in the
[1:10:25] pulpit number eight now look here's the
[1:10:30] position though you say well where is it
[1:10:32] it's with God it's up in heaviness with
[1:10:34] God God's only voice that can speak is
[1:10:37] this a sign of the end time sir look
[1:10:39] where the voices words the thunders not
[1:10:41] in heaven hello not in heaven so he's
[1:10:46] telling us where it's at not in heaven
[1:10:48] the thunders never started from the
[1:10:50] heaven they uttered from the earth
[1:10:53] I thought the Bible said it was silence
[1:10:55] in heaven we'll talk about that little
[1:11:00] head room number nine first seal watch
[1:11:03] this
[1:11:04] and then there's coming for seven
[1:11:05] mysterious thunders that's not even
[1:11:07] written at all that's right and I
[1:11:09] believe that through those seven
[1:11:10] thunders will be revealed in the last
[1:11:11] days in order to get the bride together
[1:11:13] for rapturing what faith faith because
[1:11:18] what we got right now we wouldn't be
[1:11:21] able to do it he's telling us look he's
[1:11:25] saying we got everything we're right
[1:11:26] here
[1:11:27] oh it's wonderful to have all these
[1:11:30] working but you know what all those
[1:11:31] people had that working in her life dead
[1:11:32] I hate to say that but they are there
[1:11:37] God's finished with them they're done
[1:11:39] I'm the same way with us I mean that's
[1:11:41] no shame listen man there's no shame in
[1:11:43] dying lord have mercy
[1:11:44] oh please goodness gracious you know
[1:11:49] what the hardest part is when the Bible
[1:11:51] says die daily that's a lot harder than
[1:11:54] dying physically babe and everybody
[1:11:57] awake it's harder to die daily hey man I
[1:12:04] just got that sister Johnny that was
[1:12:06] good
[1:12:06] amen we can't have enough faith for the
[1:12:10] divine healing hardly we've got to have
[1:12:12] enough faith to be changed in a moment
[1:12:13] and be swept up out of this earth and
[1:12:16] we'll find that after look and we'll
[1:12:19] find that after a while Lord will it
[1:12:21] words read right now that's for page two

[1:12:25] all that one right now we're gonna save
[1:12:27] that one all right number 10
[1:12:30] I'm still in the first seal then when
[1:12:33] the lamb took the book and broke that
[1:12:35] first seal God spoke from his eternal
[1:12:38] throne to say what that seal was to be
[1:12:41] revealed now who do you speak it through
[1:12:43] a man amen he didn't come from 14
[1:12:48] different men at that time it came from
[1:12:49] one person a man because he was a
[1:12:51] prophet he was connected to God amen
[1:12:56] but when it's placed before John it was
[1:12:59] in assemble when John saw it it was
[1:13:01] still a mystery why it wasn't even
[1:13:03] revealed right then it cannot be
[1:13:06] revealed until one he said here at the
[1:13:08] end time but it come and assemble when
[1:13:11] the Thunder remember a loud clapping
[1:13:13] noise of a thunder is the voice of God
[1:13:15] amen
[1:13:16] brother brother Chris did a wonderful
[1:13:20] short job Wednesday night but I mean the
[1:13:24] voice of God anytime God speaks into
[1:13:28] this dimension something's got to happen
[1:13:29] something's got to move call this is
[1:13:32] eternity coming into this dimension hey
[1:13:34] man
[1:13:36] brother Bob was telling something I just
[1:13:38] want to lay this in even in the natural
[1:13:40] form when a when a sperm and an egg gets
[1:13:43] together they found out now under a
[1:13:44] microscope that a spark goes off they
[1:13:47] see this luck that's life light goes off
[1:13:53] us there's a there's a little spark Bob
[1:13:55] can tell you about a little because he's
[1:13:56] telling me about the other day
[1:13:57] that when the sperm and the egg connects
[1:13:59] and they get together like to make the
[1:14:00] baby that there's a little it's this
[1:14:03] little little spot of light hey man same
[1:14:08] here when God comes into the event this
[1:14:11] dimension there is something going to
[1:14:13] happen amen
[1:14:15] a clap of thunder they thought it was a
[1:14:18] thunder but it was God he understood it
[1:14:21] for it was revealed to him see it was a
[1:14:23] thunder and noticed the first Hill
[1:14:25] opened the first field when it was open
[1:14:27] in the symbol form it thundered Chris
[1:14:29] read this Wednesday night now what about
[1:14:31] when it opened in this reality form amen
[1:14:34] it's thunder that's it because remember
[1:14:37] look when these things open in their
[1:14:39] reality form who is he going to be
[1:14:44] Moses and Elijah the two prophets at
[1:14:46] Israel you talk about a thunder
[1:14:49] they don't have some lightning an end
[1:14:51] Thunder Amen but we're gonna be gone
[1:14:53] because it's already been revealed to us
[1:14:55] it's thundered as soon as the lamb
[1:14:57] struck back to seal and what did it
[1:14:59] reveal not all of itself not all of
[1:15:04] itself first it's with God
[1:15:07] next it's in a symbol then it's revealed
[1:15:11] three things see and you know what you
[1:15:14] say well why is God doing that listen
[1:15:15] like I said before I'm gonna say it
[1:15:18] again
[1:15:18] if this Bible could have been written
[1:15:20] any different for you to understand it
[1:15:21] God would have wrote it that way the way
[1:15:24] he wrote it and the wait listen I'm
[1:15:26] gonna be honest the way he wrote it and
[1:15:28] the way the true preachers of this
[1:15:29] message to preaching it that's the way
[1:15:31] God ordained it to me if you can't
[1:15:35] understand it it's your fault but
[1:15:39] somebody's gonna see it or he went to
[1:15:41] brought it down that line he brought it
[1:15:42] down a predestinate in lines that
[1:15:44] somebody is going to attach to that and
[1:15:47] hear it and say god that's the truth but
[1:15:50] truth like Citra had it here but see she
[1:15:55] only did it in a small form sure I mean
[1:15:59] you say well it wasn't small wood for
[1:16:01] the two boys but but man well we come to
[1:16:03] that when we say this ain't nothing but
[1:16:05] the truth that's when our body will
[1:16:07] change our body will change when we say
[1:16:12] this ain't nothing nothing but the truth
[1:16:16] because we got this truth going over
[1:16:18] here we got this - it's going over here
[1:16:20] we got this seemingly truth but there's
[1:16:23] got to be one there's only one way one
[1:16:29] truth first is with God Nexus in a
[1:16:34] symbol then it's revealed three things
[1:16:36] it's coming forth from the throne
[1:16:38] where's the throne of God where is the
[1:16:43] throne of God brother Lewis been for
[1:16:47] five services downstairs the kingdom of
[1:16:49] God is within you
[1:16:52] and even pilot in his in his worst form
[1:16:56] a demon pilot was a demon okay pilot
[1:17:02] want no Christian man he said I don't
[1:17:05] see no threaten this guy his kingdom he
[1:17:08] ain't he's no threat to my kingdom right
[1:17:12] he has no revelation what Jesus was
[1:17:15] fixing to do but if you had to put him
[1:17:19] to death
[1:17:19] he's kingdom wouldn't come hey man it's
[1:17:25] coming forth from the throne first it
[1:17:27] can't be seen hurt or nothing it's
[1:17:29] sealed up the lambs blood paid the price
[1:17:33] its thundered when he spoke it out and
[1:17:36] when he did a wild horse rider started
[1:17:39] out it was still with a symbol Amen that
[1:17:45] good now what's this one number eleven
[1:17:48] home for sale the last one is gonna be
[1:17:51] real good that's what we're gonna close
[1:17:52] on to be by five minutes now we had him
[1:17:54] coming last night with his great sword
[1:17:56] to kill this is the fourth seal he's
[1:17:58] showin back on the third seal we find
[1:18:00] out that he gets killed with the sword -
[1:18:02] the sword of the word
[1:18:03] I don't think and kill the devil short
[1:18:05] of the word God's words sharp two-edged
[1:18:08] sword slays him puts him right down wait
[1:18:11] till them seven thunders uttered their
[1:18:13] voices - that group who really can take
[1:18:17] the Word of God and hand it there
[1:18:22] remember when the sword came into
[1:18:25] brother Browns hand he said it fit
[1:18:27] perfect but room if you'll remember when
[1:18:30] he continued on with the vision what did
[1:18:32] he say he said it takes a strong skilled
[1:18:36] hand of faith to handle that sword
[1:18:38] because you know what Satan is a pretty
[1:18:40] good apple story he have a say he's got
[1:18:42] a sword he's going to be given one here
[1:18:46] and just in about numbers seal two or
[1:18:48] three he's gonna be given a word so he's
[1:18:51] got a sword but that sort of the word
[1:18:53] knows where to take it like he brother
[1:18:55] Rams head right to the heart of the
[1:18:56] devil all right to the heart of the
[1:18:58] enemy so now I'm telling you we have the
[1:19:01] people on earth not just storage 'men we
[1:19:04] have my
[1:19:04] mr. swordsman's now we have master
[1:19:07] swordsmen that knows what to do with the
[1:19:09] word of God and hand it their slice and
[1:19:14] cut what's this they can close the
[1:19:17] heavens he ain't talking about the two
[1:19:21] witnesses at that point he's talking
[1:19:24] about us they can close the heavens they
[1:19:27] can shut this or do that whatever they
[1:19:29] want to glory he will be slayed by the
[1:19:31] word that proceeds from his mouth it's
[1:19:34] sharper than a two-edged sword they
[1:19:36] could call for a hundred billion tons of
[1:19:38] flies if they wanted to amen whatever
[1:19:40] they say is going to happen because it's
[1:19:42] the Word of God coming from the mouth of
[1:19:43] God God always
[1:19:45] it's his word but he always uses man to
[1:19:49] work it hey man so it's not a one-man
[1:19:53] message not anymore
[1:19:55] all right let's watch the last one and
[1:19:57] we'll be done I love this or not here

[1:20:06] seven stars the voice of the stars
[1:20:09] voices you see there was more in
[1:20:12] Revelations four here five we can find
[1:20:14] out and out of the throne proceeded
[1:20:17] lightnings thunders and voices not one
[1:20:20] voice voices plural now not seven men we
[1:20:27] know about that junk not one voice
[1:20:30] voices plural what was it God speaking
[1:20:35] to the church reflecting himself through
[1:20:38] the seven spirits when the true anointed
[1:20:41] of God speaks it's the voice of God to
[1:20:46] reject it is to remove the candlestick
[1:20:48] see voices the voice of the seven church
[1:20:51] age is over here in the corner the voice
[1:20:52] is speaking with what thunder and
[1:20:54] lightning

[1:21:27] very last one and be finished right here
[1:21:29] alright here was voices oh how we need
[1:21:34] in lula georgia thousands of live voices
[1:21:39] the thunder of god thundering out in
[1:21:42] sweetness and holiness purity undefiled
[1:21:45] lives walking around on the earth today
[1:21:47] without a white prophet without a
[1:21:50] blemish
[1:21:51] i'm just telling you what he said okay
[1:21:53] you believe it or not yes sir real
[1:21:56] christians that's thunder against the
[1:21:58] enemy the devil don't count how loud you
[1:22:01] can holler the devil don't care how much
[1:22:04] you can jump or how much do you do this
[1:22:06] to shout but what hurts the devil is to
[1:22:09] see that sanctified holy life
[1:22:12] consecrated to god say anything to him
[1:22:15] call him anything just as sweet as it
[1:22:17] can be and move right on all my that
[1:22:19] throws him away that's the thunder that
[1:22:22] shakes the devil when these seals open
[1:22:25] satan has tried his best to make it
[1:22:28] everything but the truth because
[1:22:31] remember he's not oblivious of what's
[1:22:33] going on when that prophet was standing
[1:22:36] there that night in 1963 in the
[1:22:38] tabernacle satan was right there
[1:22:40] i don't think he sent one of his minions
[1:22:43] i don't think he sit in the second in
[1:22:44] command he felt the greatest anointing
[1:22:48] if the prophet of god said this is the
[1:22:49] greatest anointing I've ever worked
[1:22:50] under Satan was standing right beside
[1:22:52] him a man and what did he do just as
[1:22:56] soon as brother Graham brought that
[1:22:57] message Satan went out and said well I
[1:23:00] think it's this I think it's this I
[1:23:01] think it's this amen they made it
[1:23:04] everything in the world but Redemption
[1:23:06] they made it everything in the world
[1:23:08] that you can't do it you got a you got
[1:23:10] to go angle T you got to go to
[1:23:13] Jeffersonville or you got to go here I'm
[1:23:15] not just saying that I'm but they do say
[1:23:17] that we know I think brother Branham
[1:23:19] just real clear it's your life that
[1:23:23] thunders louder than anything any
[1:23:26] doctrine your life thunders louder than
[1:23:29] anything if you're consecrated to God
[1:23:36] Satan can touch your life that was a
[1:23:42] weak amen
[1:23:43] I know we're about done but amen amen
[1:23:48] that's the thunder they shanks the devil
[1:23:51] see we and this is my whole point
[1:23:53] let's tan we're gonna take communion too
[1:23:55] so if anybody needs the prayer if you
[1:23:57] want to come on up if you don't we'll
[1:23:59] get ready for the communion service okay
[1:24:00] yeah go ahead what we've all thought
[1:24:04] just like I said before is that God is
[1:24:06] so far out under he's so holy that we
[1:24:10] can't listen the very holy God listen to
[1:24:14] me the very holy God under the blood of
[1:24:17] bulls and goats said if you'll come up
[1:24:20] to this mountain I'll speak to you
[1:24:23] face-to-face what about under the blood
[1:24:26] of Jesus cry come boldly to the throne
[1:24:31] ask what you will
[1:24:36] that's the Thunder ask what you will and
[1:24:40] it'll be given unto you Satan can't do
[1:24:44] that now Satan will take it he'll go
[1:24:47] well let's just twist it and turn it
[1:24:48] over this way a little bit now God said
[1:24:50] this is where it is no this is where
[1:24:53] it's gonna be you know what like I said
[1:24:55] before he wrote this right here
[1:24:56] so that every one of us could have a
[1:24:58] body change he brought the message so we
[1:25:02] can all have a body saying Amen they're
[1:25:08] just wetting the right group of people
[1:25:09] on earth at the time because rapturing
[1:25:13] faith faith rapturing faith talked of
[1:25:19] denominations they'll tell you yeah we
[1:25:20] believe in the resurrection yeah it's
[1:25:22] gonna come some time like I said it's
[1:25:23] gonna come maybe 20-30 years now
[1:25:25] forty years you know what they're saying
[1:25:27] is I don't have enough in me to overcome
[1:25:32] in it right I don't have enough in me to
[1:25:35] overcome I'm just gonna have to die when
[1:25:39] I die hallelujah by my
[1:25:43] so my god listen
[1:25:45] the Bible says them it's appointed under
[1:25:48] man wants to die
[1:25:50] that's an appointment that I'm gonna
[1:25:53] meet us right you know what you make an
[1:25:57] appointment with the doctor hell or high
[1:26:00] water you're gonna be at that doctor's
[1:26:02] appointment
[1:26:03] right but the Bible says it's appointed
[1:26:07] unto us once tonight
[1:26:08] now I've already died one time I'll have
[1:26:11] died again but now still that's not
[1:26:14] gonna give you enough rapture faith to
[1:26:15] put you in a body change you still gotta
[1:26:17] believe more you still gotta believe
[1:26:19] that I will not be at that appointment
[1:26:22] some will someone you love the Lord but
[1:26:27] that Thunder is not something out there
[1:26:29] it's not a strange doctrine the
[1:26:32] strangest thing that's going to really
[1:26:34] break Satan's back is that he's gonna
[1:26:37] look at you and go you did this and this
[1:26:39] and this and this and this and this and
[1:26:40] this and you got the back game saying no
[1:26:42] I didn't know that nor didn't nor didn't
[1:26:45] yes you did yes you damn I'm gonna argue
[1:26:47] with the devil you know I'm gonna say I
[1:26:49] said your Creator standing beside you
[1:26:52] somewhere in another dimension talk to
[1:26:54] him because he's the one to say that
[1:26:56] about me not me I'm an I'm just telling
[1:26:58] you what I'm just telling you what my
[1:26:59] creator said and he's standing next to
[1:27:00] you somewhere over there in another
[1:27:02] dimension look over and ask him and he's
[1:27:04] gonna go what sin is you talking about
[1:27:08] amen
[1:27:10] Silas in heaven silence in heaven is
[1:27:17] there my kids
[1:27:19] I can't condemn my children I've already
[1:27:24] told them work where they begun from I
[1:27:26] sent them a prophet to tell them what
[1:27:28] they're doing here and where they come
[1:27:30] from and where they're going so we can't
[1:27:33] lose we can't lose doesn't matter
[1:27:35] doesn't matter anymore
[1:27:36] god bless you let's bow our heads just
[1:27:39] for a second new Lord Jesus thank you
[1:27:41] for this day we think of this you sure
[1:27:45] enough resurrected anew in our life we
[1:27:49] know you did it physically 2,000 years
[1:27:51] ago but that wasn't the end of it you
[1:27:54] went up a few days
[1:27:55] later and said I'll be right back and
[1:27:59] said the world will see me no more but
[1:28:02] you'll see me
[1:28:02] cuz I'll be with you even in you to the
[1:28:06] end of the world or do we take that
[1:28:08] promise and we hold on to it that you
[1:28:11] are in us already but that you've not
[1:28:13] finished your work that you keep working
[1:28:16] and you keep working on us and the
[1:28:19] things that we used to do Lord we don't
[1:28:21] do them anymore
[1:28:22] the things that used to bother us Lord
[1:28:25] they don't bother us anymore the fear
[1:28:28] that we had is just as brother Ernie
[1:28:30] says false evidence appearing real
[1:28:32] fa-a-a-r false evidence appearing real
[1:28:36] you you you when you came into this
[1:28:38] dimension after you'd already had a
[1:28:40] glorified condition first thing he said
[1:28:42] was fear not fear not fear not so Lord
[1:28:46] take the fear away from the people take
[1:28:48] the fear away from all of us Lord that
[1:28:51] we'll look at you what you've already
[1:28:53] said it's not some new doctrine it's not
[1:28:56] some new but my the prophet told us the
[1:28:59] seven thunders weren't written sure
[1:29:01] they're not written there in our heart
[1:29:03] we're written epistles you said known
[1:29:06] and read of all men so let that live out
[1:29:09] Lord let that thunder here in lula
[1:29:11] georgia and everywhere we go that our
[1:29:13] life will project you Lord and that we
[1:29:16] will have I meant to mention this thanks
[1:29:19] you for bringing to my remembrance Lord
[1:29:21] the property God told us said now we
[1:29:23] have Satan's answer his answer is no
[1:29:28] Satan
[1:29:28] I will not die no Satan I will not do
[1:29:34] what I used to do no Satan I will not
[1:29:37] take that fall to doctrine because I'm
[1:29:40] covered by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:29:42] thank you Lord we ask you to be with us
[1:29:44] now in the further man the service there

[1:30:19] bad thoughts and all that we have Lord

[1:30:36] let's take communion go ahead let's give
[1:30:45] her brother a good name
[1:30:47] [Applause]
[1:30:53] even when Adam and Eve sinned God never
[1:30:58] condemned Adam God never condemned Eve
[1:31:03] I'm quoting brother Brandon he walked
[1:31:07] right into their presence in their
[1:31:09] sinful condition he stood right there
[1:31:11] and talked to him cause he'd already
[1:31:14] covered him he'd already covered it's
[1:31:22] done before the world right hey man tell
[1:31:24] her brother how much you appreciate the
[1:31:26] word yeah let's just read their
[1:31:29] scripture and going into the communion
[1:31:32] so we'll go to first Corinthians 11:23
[1:31:35] where I received of the Lord that which
[1:31:38] also I delivered unto you but the Lord
[1:31:41] Jesus the same night in which he was
[1:31:42] betrayed took bread and when he had
[1:31:45] given thanks he brake it and said take
[1:31:47] eat this is my body which is broken for
[1:31:50] you this do in remembrance of me after
[1:31:54] the same manner also he took the cup
[1:31:55] when he had supped saying this cup in
[1:31:59] the New Testament this cup is the New
[1:32:01] Testament in my blood this do ye as oft
[1:32:05] as you drink it in remembrance of men
[1:32:08] for as often as you eat this bread and
[1:32:11] drink this cup you do shew the Lord's
[1:32:13] death till he come or for whosoever
[1:32:16] shall eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:32:18] of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty
[1:32:21] of the body and blood of the law
[1:32:23] but little man examine himself and so
[1:32:25] let him eat of that bread and drink of
[1:32:27] that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:32:29] unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation
[1:32:32] to himself not discerning the Lord's
[1:32:35] body for this cause many are weak and
[1:32:38] sickly among you and many sleep for if
[1:32:41] we would judge ourselves we should not
[1:32:43] be judged unlike this if we judge
[1:32:46] herself won't be judged they didn't stop
[1:32:48] there but when we are judged we do it
[1:32:53] we're judge guilty what does he do
[1:32:58] we're chasing to the Lord that we should
[1:33:01] not be condemned with the world
[1:33:03] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:33:05] together to eat tarry one for another
[1:33:07] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[1:33:10] home that you come not together under
[1:33:12] condemnation the rest when I said in
[1:33:14] order when I come
[1:33:18] think about the communion we talk about
[1:33:23] the Easter the resurrection and the
[1:33:25] things I've just never been one to
[1:33:28] preach Easter messages or Thanksgiving
[1:33:34] messages I just try to bring what's on
[1:33:36] my heart but it's true this is Easter
[1:33:40] this is sunrise and this is the
[1:33:43] resurrection but it's talking about him
[1:33:47] not about me and you all in him what
[1:33:51] he's doing for you and for me he took
[1:33:54] our place what I said about Adam and Eve
[1:33:59] he didn't condemn him read your prophet
[1:34:01] he came the condemned the earth
[1:34:03] condemned the beasts condemned to fight
[1:34:05] but he never condemned Adam and Eve he
[1:34:09] walked right into their presence the
[1:34:11] code in his mind before the world
[1:34:13] he had already atoned as quick as he got
[1:34:17] into their presence and seeing what they
[1:34:18] were
[1:34:19] he took the animals made the atonement
[1:34:22] then he could walk right out there with
[1:34:24] him and he's been here ever since I love
[1:34:27] that statement I remember when I first
[1:34:28] heard him the Prophet said that God come
[1:34:32] down in the garden in City and never
[1:34:33] went back
[1:34:35] he came down with us to live never left
[1:34:40] that's a wonderful thing Union we come
[1:34:43] to the time of taking the communion code
[1:34:45] it's a wonderful situation and wonderful
[1:34:47] part that Paul is explaining the things
[1:34:50] he was chosen to do this because he
[1:34:54] would be able to take all the old
[1:34:55] testament the things and put it together
[1:34:57] and could come out and explain to
[1:35:00] communion what a wonderful opportunity
[1:35:03] the man would have to be chosen for that
[1:35:05] job but you don't want were the
[1:35:08] recipients never how you call that big
[1:35:11] word we're the ones who receive the
[1:35:13] benefits and in doing that then what a
[1:35:18] wonderful opportunity what it's better
[1:35:20] to understand you know is it better to
[1:35:23] understand and be able to know or is it
[1:35:26] better to walk and live into what you
[1:35:29] folks to be which one is it I'll take
[1:35:34] walking
[1:35:35] I'll take living I'll take being what I
[1:35:37] am and walking in the Lord what about
[1:35:40] you so we come to this time the Bible
[1:35:42] says they take tarried one for another
[1:35:44] so let's take a few moments suggest how
[1:35:47] silent prayer waiting and remembering
[1:35:49] each other before the Lord
[1:36:06] father as we come to this time then we
[1:36:09] think of the sick ones among us and
[1:36:11] believe in that a resurrection took
[1:36:13] place toward that you could come back
[1:36:16] and heal and deliver what an Easter what
[1:36:21] a time to walk in you reach down and
[1:36:24] touch the sick among us you said it you
[1:36:27] sent your word in healed us and deliver
[1:36:29] us from destruction so we thank you for
[1:36:32] all the things have your way forgive our
[1:36:34] sins cleanse us make us worthy to be
[1:36:39] able to protect of this communion we
[1:36:42] love you in Jesus name Amen
[1:36:50] [Music]
[1:36:54] the Bible said he took bread father we
[1:36:57] ask you to just bless this it was made
[1:37:00] for this purpose today we asked you to
[1:37:03] sanctify it because we know it's not
[1:37:05] your body
[1:37:06] it's only a representation with what a
[1:37:08] wonderful representation
[1:37:10] we're wonderful Balcon though the truth
[1:37:12] about you loving your grace we love you
[1:37:16] we thank you sanctify the food and the
[1:37:18] partakers and we may be all together as
[1:37:20] one in you in Jesus
[1:37:36] you may not think much about communion
[1:37:40] or why the issue why bad you know you
[1:37:45] didn't tell us like we did I don't throw
[1:37:49] off on nobody but we used to take the
[1:37:52] communion every three months take once
[1:37:57] over three months actually we didn't
[1:38:02] have a foot water we took the communion
[1:38:06] once every three months we'd order the
[1:38:10] book of the bag of food get it a little
[1:38:15] package we take that we have the
[1:38:24] communion what we had leftover we just
[1:38:28] put it back in the bag put it the
[1:38:31] preacher we can't fit for three months
[1:38:36] later you know we had the communion
[1:38:41] three months later we didn't follow
[1:38:44] nothing in the word toward it we divide
[1:38:47] the bread do this or try to oh you're
[1:38:49] not supposed to hold over I'm supposed
[1:38:53] to do those things
[1:38:54] you're supposed to keep it for it'll all
[1:38:57] be the fresh for the day to them they
[1:38:59] call this the word not the one off on
[1:39:04] nobody but this is telling the truth
[1:39:09] father we thank you for this wine is
[1:39:11] going through the process of aging and
[1:39:14] it's better every day the Lord because
[1:39:16] it it's the top of your blood we ask you
[1:39:19] to sanctify the blood or protectors that
[1:39:23] we may all be together in you and as we
[1:39:26] eat the little bread and we drink a
[1:39:27] little wine and tomorrow there'll be
[1:39:30] blood cells created from that so life is
[1:39:33] involved you know this represents your
[1:39:36] blood for each one of us
[1:39:38] see it would sanctify all of us together
[1:39:51] until we take we didn't believe in
[1:39:54] taking wine we were too holy
[1:40:09] you
