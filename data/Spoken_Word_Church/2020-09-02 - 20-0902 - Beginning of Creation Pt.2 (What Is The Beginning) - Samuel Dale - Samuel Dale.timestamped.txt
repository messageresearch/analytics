[3:08] in your scriptures turn to revelations 3
[3:12] and then to
[3:14] john 1.
[3:17] revelations 3 verse 14 and then we'll go
[3:20] to john 1. and we had a real good time
[3:23] last weekend
[3:24] uh wade and i
[3:26] dedicated brother forney's church and
[3:28] everything got a nice little building
[3:30] there that they can increase it some if
[3:33] they need and and everything but it's
[3:35] it's really really comfortable
[3:37] and should be uh you know be able for to
[3:40] for them to have church in it see maybe
[3:43] 50 60 right now they can change a little
[3:46] bit and do something but we had a good
[3:47] time it's on the internet
[3:49] the church
[3:50] church
[3:51] website youtube so if you want to watch
[3:54] it you can click on there and and watch
[3:56] it and see how we do it in dedicating a
[3:59] a church and also just uh we thank you
[4:02] for for everything we thank the
[4:04] ministers for taking over and all while
[4:07] we've been missing on some of these and
[4:10] uh different things we we've done it
[4:12] it's been kind of an odd thing to me
[4:13] because we went from everything from
[4:16] uh let's see which come first we went to
[4:19] a wedding
[4:22] in a funeral
[4:23] and then dedicating a church
[4:25] so we've been traveling and and doing
[4:28] and and all of these things and and had
[4:31] a good time doing it and pray that we
[4:33] done the best we could do but it turned
[4:35] out real good in each one of the cases
[4:37] but remember that just keep remembering
[4:39] my wife she still has trouble breathing
[4:41] she'll be okay for a little while and
[4:43] then it'll hit her and striker and she
[4:45] has trouble breathing through her nose
[4:48] she can still breathe pretty good
[4:49] through her mouth but it's through her
[4:51] nose and all
[4:52] feels like cotton she said stuck up
[4:54] there but at least we're open enough to
[4:57] where that they can now get into being
[4:59] able to go see doctors that can help the
[5:02] this situation you know and all like
[5:05] that because that's just a hangover part
[5:08] but just keep praying for it the lord
[5:10] would would bless her and everything
[5:12] and all of that amen
[5:15] uh
[5:16] now we're going to try if you want to
[5:20] we're going to try this coming weekend
[5:23] to have a number two stage or phase of
[5:26] what we generally do and if you remember
[5:28] that was
[5:30] that everybody's welcome to come
[5:33] but you have to sit according to the
[5:34] pews and the way they are and sit not
[5:37] real close now you can do it if you like
[5:39] a family
[5:40] can sit together if you want to that way
[5:43] you know and all but not uh you know the
[5:46] the rest of it and just use it in
[5:48] downstairs we're gonna have the open
[5:50] downstairs and open up here for you to
[5:53] be able to see and do all right now
[5:56] we're going to put one thing into stage
[5:59] uh
[6:00] this is from us but uh mainly to say
[6:03] from myself
[6:04] uh i'm asking us if we would all please
[6:08] wire mask
[6:11] all right now i'm meaning while we're
[6:12] here
[6:13] i'm meaning while you're in the church
[6:16] i'm meaning while the service is going
[6:17] on
[6:19] that's what i mean where's where i'm
[6:21] inside or outside you know we're trying
[6:23] to to do a little bit to where when we
[6:25] leave here now and going outside we put
[6:26] the mask on
[6:27] but let's put it the whole thing just
[6:30] how to wear a mask the whole time that
[6:31] we're here
[6:33] all right
[6:34] and that way it won't
[6:36] give any uh problems we should cover all
[6:38] of the the things and you know then when
[6:41] you go outside make sure you just wear
[6:43] the mask all the time you're here on the
[6:44] property inside the building outside the
[6:47] building and all to do and it'd be
[6:50] mandatory for everybody to uh do now
[6:53] this be hard for this for the preacher
[6:56] because it'd be muffled out and things
[6:58] so that won't be required for the
[7:00] preacher to do you know we'll kind of
[7:02] set that aside and the song leader
[7:05] to where that you can be clear enough to
[7:07] understand okay
[7:09] we're not trying to be too much but
[7:11] we'll do it that way but as quickly as
[7:13] you minister or song leading you go sit
[7:16] down put the mask on
[7:18] all right you understand we're just
[7:20] going to try to go
[7:21] that away and see how it works out
[7:24] and all if it does we'll keep increasing
[7:27] possibly we'll we will announce it
[7:30] sunday but we may try to take communion
[7:33] the next sunday if we do we'll try to
[7:36] arrange something either we can make it
[7:38] inside or we can make it work that we
[7:40] can just line up outside and and walk
[7:43] out to church and take communion as
[7:44] you're going out and whatever we can do
[7:46] we'll try to because you know everybody
[7:48] wants to go to church and get back in
[7:50] church
[7:51] because that's that's
[7:53] that's part of it i i like to be in
[7:55] church
[7:56] and but we're going to try to do the
[7:57] best we can to follow and and and do it
[8:01] on the grounds don't hug and and do
[8:04] everything you know try to keep
[8:05] everything uh what is that word
[8:07] distances
[8:09] yeah i never didn't understand why they
[8:11] call it social because you know social
[8:13] district
[8:14] social means you would get together
[8:16] distance
[8:18] okay no problem
[8:20] but just remember that
[8:21] but we do truly thank brother
[8:24] luis they're started last wednesday then
[8:27] brother bob and brother aaron for sunday
[8:29] services and i think they've done a
[8:31] marvelous job it was you know good good
[8:34] services all three of them i really
[8:36] enjoyed it and all three of them related
[8:38] to each other and we're still right on
[8:40] the same thing because you're going to
[8:42] pick that up tonight and just keep going
[8:45] with it and praying that god would bless
[8:46] all of us anything else
[8:50] i'm thinking that's basically what's
[8:52] covering the whole thing okay
[8:54] all right we're going to try what we can
[8:58] okay revelations 3 14 and john
[9:01] 1
[9:02] 14-18 father we thank you for your grace
[9:06] and your love thank you for everything
[9:08] and we just ask you lord to be with us
[9:10] and help us we're trying our best to do
[9:12] everything we can
[9:15] in the physical realms and things of
[9:17] life to try to not aggravate these
[9:20] things and and try to bring on these
[9:22] situations we're doing the best we can
[9:24] lord and doing that that and trying to
[9:27] be able to come to church and have a
[9:29] good time we ask you that you just reach
[9:32] down and touch all of these that are
[9:33] sick and lord remember our wife remember
[9:36] richard remember uh the different ones
[9:38] many of us named tonight and just have
[9:40] your way some
[9:41] lord they've been sick for quite a while
[9:44] and we pray that you would just reach
[9:46] down and touch each one
[9:48] in your loving your grace maybe we can
[9:50] get back together and have more
[9:52] fellowship into the to the the church
[9:55] and things and that will be able to
[9:58] bring you on the scene in our hearts and
[10:00] lives because you did promise it you
[10:02] said wherever two or three are gathered
[10:04] in my name you'd be in the mist
[10:06] so as we gather a few more people coming
[10:08] in and
[10:10] fellowshipping together around thy word
[10:12] we pray that you would just come on the
[10:14] scene and touch each one
[10:15] forgive our sins lead us by thy grace
[10:18] and love and keep us in jesus name amen
[10:23] all right we've been on this we'll
[10:24] probably be using this for a while but
[10:28] i knew that would do that
[10:30] i'm losing my eyes
[10:33] yeah
[10:34] i don't need them anyway i can run out
[10:36] of ones yeah
[10:39] that's the way glasses do okay
[10:42] revelation 3 14.
[10:45] okay what are we on what is the
[10:47] beginning we're in the beginning of
[10:48] creation part two now we're going to
[10:51] talk about tonight more on what is the
[10:53] beginning
[10:54] all right and unto the angel of the
[10:56] church of the lady of sian's right these
[10:58] things saith the amen
[11:00] the faithful and true witness the
[11:02] beginning of the creation of god now
[11:04] let's go to john
[11:06] 1
[11:10] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[11:11] among us and we beheld his glory as the
[11:13] glory
[11:14] as of the only begotten of the father
[11:17] full of grace and truth
[11:19] john bare witness of him and cried
[11:21] saying this was he of whom i spake
[11:24] he that cometh after me is preferred
[11:26] before me for he was before me
[11:30] and his fullness have all we received in
[11:33] grace for grace for the law was given by
[11:36] moses but grace and truth came by jesus
[11:38] christ no man hath seen god now notice
[11:41] that and keep it in mind no man has seen
[11:44] god at any time
[11:47] all right
[11:48] the only begotten son
[11:51] which is in the bosom of the father
[11:53] he hath
[11:54] declared him you may be seated the lord
[11:57] had his blessing to the reading of the
[11:59] word now
[12:01] i want us to stick with it tonight a
[12:03] little more because of what we spoke on
[12:05] the last time
[12:08] in uh trying to to do you remember what
[12:11] we were talking about we're gonna have
[12:12] three parts or three stages whatever you
[12:15] want to call it
[12:16] part one is
[12:18] seeing almighty god
[12:21] and how he manifests himself how he
[12:23] comes into being
[12:26] to where we can comprehend
[12:28] all right and then we'll move into the
[12:30] second stage which will be into the word
[12:34] dwelling with us and the sun coming down
[12:37] to where that we can comprehend that and
[12:40] then we will get to the bride of jesus
[12:43] christ and all because we're dealing
[12:45] with what all god was
[12:48] yes
[12:50] now how many times did the prophet say
[12:52] that
[12:53] all god was
[12:56] was poured into christ
[12:59] all christ was
[13:01] was poured into the to the church
[13:04] and to take her back to the garden of
[13:06] eden the threefold purpose of christ is
[13:08] a mystery all right
[13:09] now how have we tried to cover that
[13:12] remember all god was
[13:15] was poured into christ well does that
[13:17] mean there's no more god
[13:20] you know
[13:22] all right see then you know what states
[13:24] and all god was poured into christ well
[13:26] okay no more god then you take all
[13:28] christ poured into the church is it no
[13:30] more christ
[13:32] see that's what i'm saying
[13:34] the words
[13:36] words we use
[13:39] are are uh
[13:40] the hardest thing to try to comprehend
[13:43] with i don't know where you'd say that
[13:45] right or not but
[13:46] you know
[13:48] it's hard to communicate
[13:52] because our minds
[13:54] are the way they are
[13:55] all right we think well oh we're doing
[13:57] good i don't see why in the world
[13:58] anybody couldn't understand that well
[14:00] why does a theologian teach a trinity
[14:06] now i'm talking about you know a
[14:08] theologian a a highly
[14:11] educated trained
[14:13] person
[14:14] who knows all of the greek
[14:17] the hebrew the the thing but why does he
[14:20] come up with a trinity out of the word
[14:22] of god when it is not even in the word
[14:25] at all
[14:27] all right and see then
[14:29] you you look at it like that and you you
[14:31] you begin to think about
[14:34] that our problems is our mind
[14:37] our comprehension of
[14:39] uh
[14:40] wordings
[14:42] you know
[14:43] and things it it messes us up you say
[14:45] well now uh
[14:47] uh
[14:48] we we should all say well that's true
[14:51] now like i've always said and this crazy
[14:53] way of saying it um
[14:55] but
[14:56] you you can go overseas
[14:59] and and you can see different languages
[15:02] and different people
[15:05] and all i can but you know what little
[15:07] bit
[15:08] that i've been overseas
[15:11] i never detected the dogs barking in
[15:14] spanish
[15:16] and and
[15:17] you know
[15:19] you understand
[15:22] i've never heard a dog bark in spanish
[15:25] i don't i don't understand why see maybe
[15:28] the dog has some more ability to
[15:30] communicate than we do
[15:32] because he doesn't do that but yet the
[15:34] people speak to him in spanish
[15:39] right and they will train him and he'll
[15:41] comprehend in spanish
[15:43] because that's just a part of doing it
[15:45] but to start with he doesn't bark
[15:48] the mark don't change
[15:50] because it's the same all right now what
[15:52] was our main
[15:54] point
[15:55] like i said then we're studying what all
[15:57] god was
[16:00] we're going to see how that's poured
[16:01] into christ
[16:03] all right then how christ is poured into
[16:05] the church
[16:07] and we'll see then that that is the way
[16:09] to understand how we're going back to
[16:11] the garden of eden are to be fully
[16:13] redeemed all right now
[16:16] so
[16:17] what was the main point that we were
[16:19] trying to make on our lives uh which was
[16:22] uh the first message of this
[16:25] we're talking about beginning of
[16:27] creation
[16:28] because we read there you'll get to that
[16:30] later see i'm using it in to word it'll
[16:33] match up see when you come to the
[16:35] beginning of the creation of god
[16:39] you've moved over a stage or two that
[16:42] you know that you need to have
[16:44] understanding how you got there
[16:46] all right so we're we're taking what the
[16:49] prophet said and the wordings he says
[16:51] and then
[16:52] applying that to where we're at and and
[16:55] what we're doing
[16:57] to understand all right
[17:00] now
[17:01] we know that
[17:04] there in the old testament when he came
[17:06] forth he was the i am
[17:09] he said i am that i am
[17:12] that was to be his name forever
[17:15] all right now i am means ever-present
[17:19] for eternity
[17:21] but you just don't pray and say
[17:23] i pray thee in the ni in in i am i pray
[17:26] thee and i am
[17:28] no
[17:30] we we we're smart enough to understand
[17:33] we're told to pray in the name of jesus
[17:34] christ
[17:36] he said ask anything in my name we'll
[17:38] pray we're to pray in that name why
[17:40] because that name is the i am
[17:43] amen
[17:44] you're recognizing him as that i am
[17:48] the ever president for eternity
[17:51] is speaking to you that's his name his
[17:54] name was not even jehovah that's that's
[17:56] that's certain of scripture he said by
[17:58] my name jehovah was i never known that's
[18:01] right
[18:02] all right it's jvhv and there was no way
[18:05] to pronounce it and the best they could
[18:07] do was call it jehovah
[18:10] all right but he said by my name jehovah
[18:12] by jvhv i was never known
[18:15] see there was no way to no way to
[18:17] understand that so the best you could do
[18:19] is go back to self-existing
[18:22] you can go back and pick up the wordings
[18:24] then of of elohim
[18:27] and showing that elohim means
[18:29] self-existing
[18:31] all you all of those things running back
[18:33] to the point of understanding
[18:36] what his name is but his name is jesus
[18:39] see that's that should be the most
[18:41] simple thing for us to understand as you
[18:44] you'd say to somebody say what's the
[18:45] name of god well his name's god
[18:49] no no god's not a name
[18:51] god's a title
[18:53] jehovah jireh jovitis jehovah tischendo
[18:55] et cetera et cetera that's titles to a
[18:57] name
[18:59] but his name is jesus
[19:01] well then everything we pray and
[19:03] everything we do the bible says
[19:06] is to be done in the name of jesus
[19:09] christ
[19:10] all right that's why our baptism is
[19:12] correct all of the things we have see
[19:15] following it we baptize in the name of
[19:17] the lord jesus christ
[19:20] all right that's simple to us
[19:22] but do you realize that the biggest
[19:24] portion of the religious world does not
[19:27] believe that
[19:29] they believe in father son and holy
[19:31] ghost
[19:34] they won't take it and try to understand
[19:37] all right because it's contrary in their
[19:39] wording and you know their teachings
[19:41] coming down all right
[19:43] but we were we're trying to to get up to
[19:45] a point there i was in the last message
[19:48] to understanding
[19:51] what the statement the prophet made
[19:56] and by him making that statement
[19:59] it sounds like contrary to common sense
[20:03] but yet it is the only way once you get
[20:07] it lined up correctly in your mind it's
[20:09] just like
[20:10] lord jesus christ father son and holy
[20:12] ghost is any trouble with that
[20:15] i can tell you because that's the way we
[20:17] baptize to fulfill the great commission
[20:21] amen now i found that from the prophets
[20:22] reason i used it that way because we
[20:24] already know it enough to use it but
[20:26] when i baptize somebody i'll say to
[20:28] fulfill the great commission of
[20:30] baptizing the name of the father and the
[20:32] son and the holy ghost i'd now baptize
[20:34] thee my brother sister in the name of
[20:36] the lord jesus christ
[20:39] all right that's simple terminologies to
[20:41] us and simple truth
[20:43] but to the world it is baffling
[20:47] because they can't understand that
[20:49] no father's father his name is father's
[20:52] father you know father well father is
[20:54] not a name
[20:56] son is not a name
[20:58] holy ghost is not a name
[21:02] that way we can can lean back into the
[21:05] word and find a real truth but it'll
[21:07] come all the way my emphasis is it comes
[21:10] all the way through
[21:12] just as we were talking about
[21:14] uh let's see in the uh
[21:17] the dedication of the
[21:20] the church
[21:22] see
[21:22] here's moses
[21:25] taking in bad badger skins et cetera and
[21:27] made us ten
[21:29] god was happy to come down dwell in it
[21:31] but that wasn't what he wanted
[21:34] it was okay it was fine
[21:36] then here comes david over really
[21:38] wanting to build god a house and supply
[21:41] the material
[21:42] because when he found out he couldn't do
[21:43] it he turned it over to solomon well
[21:46] since when solomon built a house for god
[21:49] god was so happy about that until he
[21:52] came down
[21:53] into those situations there and and so
[21:56] was engulfed in the building till they
[21:58] couldn't even worship and couldn't
[22:00] couldn't do anything
[22:02] why because he was so happy
[22:05] so pleased to dwell
[22:08] but that still wasn't it
[22:10] trying to get a little point like slide
[22:12] something in there see all right then
[22:14] one day a baby was born
[22:17] and that baby growed up and he was
[22:20] there on the river jordan and john
[22:21] baptized him and he says this is my
[22:23] beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell
[22:29] there was the body hebrews 10 5
[22:33] of almighty god
[22:36] was that human body
[22:38] and we'll get to it on the next stage
[22:40] too more of it on the beginning of the
[22:43] creation of guardians and coming through
[22:45] that but there it was
[22:47] there was
[22:49] the fulfillment of the scriptures
[22:53] that god could come down and be pleased
[22:56] to dwell in a human vessel
[23:00] but he was pleased to dwell in a
[23:02] building
[23:04] all right but it's like i was
[23:05] emphasizing to them now don't forget now
[23:07] and think about it that when we go out
[23:09] the door god goes out the door and it's
[23:10] an empty building do we get back and he
[23:12] don't come in the building till we get
[23:13] back don't get all tied up in
[23:16] situations or something just be sensible
[23:20] you know if he wants to stay here he can
[23:23] stay here if he wants to go we can go
[23:24] with i'd rather think about him going
[23:26] with me or in me
[23:29] because the body thou has prepared me
[23:31] all right that body when it came forth
[23:34] that was the body of almighty god
[23:38] that body was a bottle you know of 16
[23:41] elements
[23:43] and that was as i said we'll get over to
[23:45] the next day or two when it says the
[23:47] beginning of the creation of god and
[23:49] brought around and said when did it when
[23:50] did this begin he said in the wound of a
[23:52] virgin
[23:53] all right we'll get to those stages as
[23:56] we go along but i want you to just kind
[23:58] of drop back and stay with me into
[24:00] thinking about
[24:04] what does the word beginning mean to you
[24:08] well
[24:10] something starts
[24:12] well that's that's all right that's
[24:13] that's human terminologies
[24:16] you know but what is really you know
[24:18] something beginning
[24:20] the beginning of the creation of god it
[24:22] don't even
[24:24] you mean god had a beginning
[24:28] see
[24:30] beginning of the creation
[24:32] are you saying well well
[24:34] god was non-existence and then he become
[24:36] existent
[24:38] no
[24:39] i've tried to explain that and people
[24:41] look at me you know
[24:42] and over the years i've tried my best to
[24:44] explain it
[24:45] that you know you say well brother dale
[24:47] do you mean before this world ever begun
[24:49] that that god had a body
[24:53] yeah
[24:55] yeah that's exactly what i believe
[24:58] you say well what kind of a body was
[25:00] this 16 l it's better than this body
[25:04] let me quote the prophet about a
[25:05] theophany when we get over that he said
[25:07] it's far more greater
[25:10] than your natural body for more greater
[25:12] than your hands for more greater than
[25:15] your eyes
[25:17] see it's more real
[25:19] all right as we go back that way to
[25:21] comprehend eternal god remember it's not
[25:24] going to become less
[25:27] it's not something that is being done
[25:29] away with it
[25:32] neither going forward
[25:34] are we going to leave something
[25:37] no
[25:39] it's in our thinking to where we can say
[25:44] god is real
[25:49] he's not like the wind i've got a quote
[25:52] here from the prophet
[25:55] he said he's a being.
[25:56] [Music]
[25:58] he said he's not like the wind
[26:01] all right see now when you say god is a
[26:03] spirit what do you think of
[26:09] our terminologies
[26:11] no
[26:13] let's say we're back of like a 20 30
[26:15] years ago we used to think that way
[26:16] anyway well we should be getting away
[26:18] from that much but still
[26:21] our terminologies about things is what's
[26:24] confusing
[26:25] god is a spirit
[26:27] john what 4 24
[26:30] they that worship him must worship him
[26:32] in spirit and in truth
[26:34] well what was the first man
[26:38] that god made
[26:40] a spirit man why because god was a
[26:42] spirit okay we're great we'll follow
[26:44] that
[26:46] i never believed that that he didn't
[26:49] exist
[26:52] because see
[26:53] the more you would go backward into
[26:55] understanding you would find greater
[26:58] things
[26:59] you mean to tell me you think that they
[27:01] could they could be
[27:03] back there somewhere that he was
[27:04] tangible well why not right right
[27:08] the word of god is tangible
[27:12] faith is the substance of things so far
[27:16] that's pretty well tangible
[27:18] the substance of what anything you hope
[27:19] for that's what faith really is
[27:21] and see the father we would go back
[27:25] into eternity you're never going to go
[27:27] back so far that you run out of god
[27:30] that's right
[27:32] right
[27:35] because you go back to self-existing
[27:39] but then remember
[27:41] that when he was self-existing
[27:44] he was far more real than we are as
[27:47] existing
[27:49] right
[27:51] that's the way i believe it that's the
[27:52] way i've always taught it why because i
[27:54] believe in one god
[28:00] don't do away with anything to try to
[28:01] explain one god let it explain itself
[28:06] let it let it unfold and and and be able
[28:10] to understand
[28:12] you know
[28:13] and that way the things that is said by
[28:15] the prophet and the bible won't be
[28:17] confusing look at scripture god is a
[28:20] spirit
[28:22] well he's just a spirit he's just
[28:24] something floating around well if he's
[28:26] floating around he's something
[28:31] come on oh no no he's just
[28:33] well
[28:34] a spirit is something
[28:40] the only problem is is we're trying to
[28:42] bring into
[28:45] our
[28:46] situation of looking at tangibles to try
[28:49] to bring him into that situation
[28:52] well
[28:53] come on he hasn't been far beyond that
[28:56] because he's done brought it into being
[28:59] that was the point i was trying to get
[29:00] us that to where let's go ahead and pick
[29:02] up
[29:03] the ones because i want to make sure we
[29:05] keep getting this
[29:07] go to number three
[29:10] which is questions and answers
[29:12] on genesis
[29:15] this is the one that you you read it
[29:17] through
[29:18] you know that's that's number two quote
[29:20] number three
[29:21] okay
[29:24] now if god created man in his own image
[29:26] and his own likeness what kind of a man
[29:28] did he create
[29:30] a spirit man
[29:33] not a spirit
[29:36] a spirit man amen
[29:39] see when i look at it god is a spirit i
[29:42] look at it as in this way god is a
[29:45] spiritual being
[29:48] now i've got something tangible
[29:52] that my eyes cannot see
[29:57] that my hands cannot feel
[30:00] but i've got something there that is
[30:01] called faith
[30:04] that is then the substance of what
[30:06] things
[30:08] is and that comes from faith what is
[30:10] faith
[30:11] well i right turned my hand you know i i
[30:14] i got faith no
[30:16] that won't control the world
[30:18] that won't heal your body when you're
[30:20] sick right
[30:23] but if you've got faith
[30:25] it is the substance of what you're
[30:27] asking for
[30:30] it's the evidence of things that is you
[30:33] know real all right so now listen to
[30:35] what he's saying
[30:38] what kind of a man did he make
[30:41] all right
[30:42] what is god
[30:45] the bible says god is the spirit
[30:51] okay then if god is a spirit then he
[30:53] created a spirit man amen
[30:57] right
[30:58] now if you'll notice after he had made
[31:00] all the creation and created a spirit
[31:02] man the close reading of this now to the
[31:04] one that asks the question we'll find
[31:07] this
[31:07] that god give dominion
[31:10] of the cattle and the fishes
[31:13] and everything to the man
[31:16] but in his makeup up there he made man
[31:20] in his own image to lead the cattle now
[31:24] that is a spirit man
[31:26] that is not a physical man spirit man
[31:29] who remember the back emphasis on the
[31:31] message before what did we cover
[31:33] we're covering two things ways covering
[31:36] two parts bob dylan's been in and
[31:38] everybody brother louise come in with
[31:40] the uh you know
[31:42] for knowledge
[31:43] and well praise god aaron coming along
[31:46] hitting on it okay we're all trying to
[31:48] do one thing get to see something real
[31:51] you know
[31:52] right
[31:54] i'm talking about something real
[31:56] ain't talking about just a spirit
[31:57] floating around
[32:00] but i i will say it this way i've never
[32:01] been drunk never trained any but i've
[32:03] always heard these people talk about
[32:05] that you you get drunk and you get
[32:07] seeing pink elephants
[32:10] well
[32:13] that guy would run in front of a train
[32:14] probably get away from a pink elephant
[32:18] but the pink elephant don't exist
[32:20] that's the thoughts of his mind
[32:23] all right but look at this
[32:25] coming on down now the beast of the
[32:26] fields just like the holy spirit leads
[32:28] to believers today he was in other words
[32:31] adam
[32:33] the first man in the lower creations
[32:36] of god amen
[32:38] now remember is who adam
[32:40] amen
[32:42] and the lord bringing it downward
[32:45] not lower down
[32:47] bringing it down to be able to
[32:49] comprehend
[32:50] see
[32:51] the first creation was god himself
[32:56] first creation is god himself i can just
[32:59] see a theologian here and brother
[33:00] branham and say those things you know
[33:02] and he says well that guy's all messed
[33:04] up
[33:05] he don't
[33:07] but he's saying it the only way it can
[33:08] be said
[33:12] you tell me any other way that can be
[33:14] said
[33:15] how can you explain god
[33:18] which is so far back that away
[33:21] until it's eternity granting and just
[33:23] keeps going and he's so far that away
[33:25] until his eternity is still going and
[33:29] how can you explain god
[33:31] well he's just a spirit no he's not a
[33:34] spirit the prophet said if you want it
[33:36] he said he's a being said he's not like
[33:39] the wind
[33:41] not just something floating around you
[33:43] know
[33:44] he's a being
[33:45] all right he's a spiritual being
[33:49] all right
[33:50] so put that in your little computer
[33:52] brain parts and think about when you say
[33:54] god is a spirit they say god is a
[33:55] spiritual being
[33:57] he's a being
[34:00] he's a person
[34:03] right all right then out of god came the
[34:07] logos which was the son of god then out
[34:10] of the logos which was the word comes on
[34:12] the beginning was the word you're coming
[34:14] on down to the man but stay up in here
[34:16] until we we'll get a stage two when we
[34:19] start talking about the logos the
[34:20] theophany the word the creation etc and
[34:23] you'll see that then god is so real
[34:26] until
[34:28] you won't miss what is being said so
[34:30] just think about it now
[34:34] the first creation was god himself
[34:38] let's put it this way
[34:40] uh the first
[34:42] thing that could be
[34:44] comprehended
[34:47] understood
[34:53] was god himself
[34:55] now you can just keep going
[35:00] you said but but brother dale uh god is
[35:04] a spirit was there a time that he wasn't
[35:06] no there wasn't the time that he was in
[35:08] the spirit
[35:09] now come on listen
[35:11] there's not a time that he wasn't god
[35:15] we're just trying to explain it oh no no
[35:17] no no he he wasn't god because god is an
[35:20] object of worship
[35:22] well god was an object of worship before
[35:24] a man who got here to worship him
[35:27] so don't run that route seeing and it's
[35:30] it's our thinking we bring our thinking
[35:32] into it and say god is a spirit
[35:36] well
[35:36] brother dale just don't understand god
[35:38] is a spirit
[35:40] well explain to me what a spirit is
[35:49] a spirit can go through that wall
[35:52] and come back
[35:56] right
[35:56] let's see you do it
[36:01] so there's something more powerful there
[36:03] than we're talking you know in our human
[36:05] terminologies
[36:07] something is more real than what our
[36:09] thoughts
[36:12] all right now if it's true
[36:14] that moses saw i am at the burning bush
[36:19] and that i am stayed so much in a con
[36:23] connection to mankind until when jesus
[36:26] came forth he said before abraham was i
[36:28] am
[36:31] he said i am that i am
[36:34] ever present for eternity
[36:38] and that's his name
[36:41] not to just say his name as i am
[36:45] he had a name before i am came into
[36:47] being
[36:48] now let me put it this way because i
[36:49] want to correct my own thoughts and but
[36:51] telling you something about brother
[36:53] brown says there was a time he didn't
[36:55] have a name
[36:59] i mean you know that's no problem to me
[37:02] there was a time he had no connection to
[37:04] mankind
[37:06] that would relate to a name
[37:09] he had no reason for a name he had no no
[37:11] doing there was nobody there
[37:15] he existed alone
[37:19] see that's why
[37:20] i thought that when brother louise was
[37:22] preaching earlier today that's why
[37:23] people will say well you know i was back
[37:26] there
[37:27] be careful how far you go back
[37:30] because you could predestinate yourself
[37:32] out of existence
[37:35] right
[37:39] i mean you would you would actually be
[37:40] taking yourself totally out of existence
[37:45] you got to remember the eternal life
[37:48] always was eternal
[37:50] the prophet said not your being here
[37:53] not what we are
[37:56] see
[37:59] but to follow it and see
[38:01] that
[38:03] the bible explains one truth of the
[38:05] living god
[38:07] and the bible starts out and the prophet
[38:10] started out explaining god
[38:14] all right
[38:15] now you got a problem when you start
[38:16] doing that because the human
[38:17] terminologies
[38:19] as i've been saying over and over that
[38:21] runs into into our makeup and our mind
[38:23] and starts bouncing around with those
[38:25] little marbles in there and it don't
[38:26] work too good
[38:29] all right
[38:31] but you see
[38:34] the first creation was god himself
[38:38] now was he nothing
[38:40] and then he created himself
[38:44] well only ask one thing where did he get
[38:46] where he what he created himself from
[38:51] if you're going to say he created his
[38:53] own self no
[38:54] get all of that see get that out of our
[38:56] mind and our
[38:58] thinking get it in there in the basis of
[39:01] understanding one thing
[39:04] the word beginning sure means
[39:08] something that starts
[39:11] a starting point
[39:13] you've got many terminologies
[39:16] or points brought to it but
[39:19] think of
[39:23] the fact
[39:25] that he
[39:29] always has been
[39:31] and always will be
[39:34] the eternal god
[39:38] there's no time for him to start
[39:40] that he mean he wasn't back there and
[39:43] there's no time for him to run out of
[39:45] over here
[39:47] just think about it
[39:49] think about then being as
[39:52] a time that
[39:55] because let's let's just go to that
[39:56] scripture and join them
[39:58] all right now what does it say
[40:02] it says the only begotten
[40:04] hath declared him
[40:11] the only begotten have declared him
[40:13] what does declare mean to bring out into
[40:15] the open or to show
[40:17] or to make known
[40:20] you know
[40:21] something coming into being
[40:24] something that you could not comprehend
[40:26] before but all at once it can be
[40:28] comprehended and once it does it's more
[40:31] real than what this was over here that
[40:33] you're
[40:36] right see god is real
[40:41] and that's the whole point
[40:45] i i keep bringing these where you'll
[40:47] think about it
[40:49] you say
[40:50] well will he become
[40:52] he become god when he created the angels
[40:57] what was he before then
[41:02] that just means the angels worshiped him
[41:05] was he before then
[41:08] you know how did he exist before then
[41:12] was he non-existent
[41:15] now you're going to predestinate him
[41:16] clean out of existence
[41:21] i'm trying to preach one god i said this
[41:23] many many years ago i said i didn't
[41:25] finish what i see
[41:26] i said one of these days i'll get around
[41:28] and preach on one god well i'm around
[41:30] for trying it
[41:32] okay just bear with me
[41:34] to worry that i can try to express it if
[41:37] you don't agree with it just come tell
[41:38] me
[41:39] you think it's a better way to explain
[41:41] it come tell me i'd sure love to know
[41:43] because
[41:44] see
[41:48] god never just was non-existent
[41:52] you know i can't do this the way i want
[41:54] to but
[41:55] i'm making this like a point
[41:57] that see you can't see this piece of
[41:59] paper all right so it's nonexistent
[42:01] there's nothing up here then all at once
[42:03] here comes some
[42:07] see that's what you're thinking that's
[42:08] what your mind is
[42:10] is telling you
[42:12] that there was a time he didn't
[42:14] exist but then he existed
[42:18] now think about it
[42:20] see i love the way the prophet says it
[42:22] like this
[42:25] and see then remember the other week i
[42:26] kept emphasizing
[42:28] you know
[42:29] that
[42:30] adam and eve
[42:32] did not make god
[42:34] a father
[42:37] he was already a father for them
[42:42] they didn't make him a father
[42:44] he was a father before then he was god
[42:47] before then he was all of these things
[42:49] back there back in time as we'd call it
[42:51] but yet back in eternity
[42:55] and see you'd say well well well that
[42:57] made him father that didn't make him
[42:59] father
[43:00] for adam and eve
[43:03] he was already the father
[43:09] he already existed as a father he was
[43:11] just not known as that
[43:15] he was already god
[43:17] he's always you ever heard the prophet
[43:19] say he's always been god
[43:21] well then why do we want to put
[43:23] something well he
[43:24] well i i got the quote where the prophet
[43:27] said well amen
[43:30] but what are you trying to do with it
[43:34] i mean
[43:35] is it to you that there's somewhere that
[43:37] your god did not exist at all
[43:40] and then he come into existence
[43:47] why not put it to the basis that that he
[43:50] was
[43:51] always existed
[43:53] but he couldn't come into existence to
[43:55] the human mind
[44:01] because that's what really being brought
[44:03] out means it means to bring him forth or
[44:07] declare means
[44:09] to lead out
[44:11] to go before no
[44:13] to unfold
[44:16] see
[44:19] it means to come forth
[44:21] what did he do
[44:23] he declared him
[44:24] there was no way listen there was no way
[44:28] to understand god
[44:32] outside of the bases of the lord jesus
[44:34] christ becoming that one
[44:37] that would first start dealing with as
[44:39] we'll get to it later as the christ
[44:42] then dealing with him as the human
[44:44] element
[44:46] then dealing with him back into the
[44:47] church
[44:49] which looks like you're going backwards
[44:50] no
[44:51] you keep him going forward
[44:54] see when this winds up and you see the
[44:56] way that i'm trying to bring it you're
[44:58] going to see all god was according to
[44:59] christ and all christ in the church
[45:01] you're going to see every move he makes
[45:02] is that much more
[45:06] it ain't going to leave a gap all god
[45:08] was he poured in the crowd
[45:12] seal it off
[45:15] well where's god
[45:17] he ain't no more he poured him over here
[45:20] no
[45:23] that makes him greater
[45:27] i mean i'm sorry that's why i said that
[45:29] may seem greater where he could take
[45:31] what he was
[45:32] and bring it into another form and
[45:35] morphe changed
[45:38] and manifest himself
[45:40] finally one day until on the shores of
[45:43] galilee walked a man
[45:47] that could say before abraham was i am
[45:51] amen
[45:56] season that body will never be done away
[45:58] will
[46:00] but now we've got the prophet's message
[46:02] thank god for see that body was not
[46:04] eternal it was born from a woman it was
[46:07] created in the wound of a virgin
[46:11] that body had to be made eternal in the
[46:13] resurrection in rapture
[46:15] back there of the lord jesus the chains
[46:18] the ascension
[46:20] all right see then it became eternal but
[46:22] it'll never be separated no more that's
[46:24] why i've always taught it i always
[46:26] believed it when we get there we're not
[46:28] going to see a father a son a holy ghost
[46:31] and this and brother ernie gets that
[46:33] flooding that dove floating around i
[46:35] like him's way because he says them
[46:36] catholics get that dove floating like
[46:38] that but it's not going to be
[46:41] when we get there we'll see jesus and
[46:44] realize that all the time he was god
[46:49] he said show us the father
[46:51] then it suffices us or satisfied he said
[46:53] have i been so long with you
[46:57] if you've seen me
[46:59] he said you've seen the father
[47:04] but just keep in mind now what i'm
[47:06] talking about
[47:07] all god was poured into christ doesn't
[47:09] do away with god
[47:11] it increases
[47:13] glory
[47:15] right
[47:17] because i like the way brother
[47:20] harris was preaching you know he said
[47:22] that old devil he said if he left jesus
[47:24] alone said he had one jesus one christ
[47:27] he said if he just left him alone
[47:29] instead of that he jumped on him he
[47:31] killed him said first thing you know you
[47:33] got 120.
[47:34] then the next hour a few later you've
[47:36] got 3 thousand
[47:38] if he'd left him alone
[47:41] well see he couldn't do it
[47:43] but follow me now
[47:47] why would a prophet say the first thing
[47:53] was god himself
[47:56] amen
[47:59] now
[48:01] to be able to fulfill all the scripture
[48:03] of the declaring
[48:06] now listen
[48:07] because that's what we read in john
[48:10] but the son hath declared him
[48:12] now before you can bring that into being
[48:15] you've got to bring four thousand years
[48:19] of existence on earth
[48:23] where was god then
[48:27] because that existence of coming into
[48:30] the christ
[48:32] could be seen back there but not fully
[48:35] made manifest
[48:39] but then one day
[48:40] here come a man
[48:43] on earth
[48:44] his name was jesus
[48:48] and upon him on the river jordan
[48:52] right i believe that those brothers were
[48:54] trying to preach if they didn't just
[48:55] listen i believe that i believe that on
[48:58] the river jordan he became the fullness
[49:00] of the godhead bodily well before that
[49:03] when the holy ghost was he was a baby
[49:06] he was a teenager
[49:09] right it couldn't be the fullness at
[49:11] that time he couldn't die for our sins
[49:13] at two years old that's right
[49:17] oh see get your mind in the thinking
[49:19] gear
[49:20] all right but see one day
[49:25] you see what was taking place
[49:28] the
[49:28] father stepped down in human flesh
[49:36] now listen for a second
[49:39] that human flesh
[49:41] is called the son of god
[49:48] okay
[49:50] son of god
[49:52] now he never declared himself to be the
[49:53] son of god so hold on why
[49:56] why did he not declare himself to be the
[49:57] son of god
[50:03] come on and you thought about it why
[50:06] did he not relate to himself as son of
[50:08] god
[50:10] he always related to himself as son of
[50:12] man
[50:16] now back to where adam and eve was
[50:18] didn't make him father do you realize
[50:21] brother brandon made a statement one day
[50:23] and he said
[50:25] in the son of man
[50:27] he became the father he wanted to be
[50:32] man that looks like
[50:34] human
[50:35] reproductions
[50:37] right
[50:39] but no
[50:42] because you see
[50:44] that's the point
[50:46] you go back in god to word that he's
[50:49] there and he's the first
[50:52] in stage 2 he's the son
[50:58] now you're to john 1. in the beginning
[51:00] was the word the word was with god and
[51:02] the word was god and the word was made
[51:03] flesh and dwelt among now you've got it
[51:05] to her there was standing a man the word
[51:07] was standing in human flesh
[51:10] where was it before then through the
[51:12] prophets to the men of all through the
[51:14] time
[51:20] i know that it hurts people's feelings
[51:22] for you to say things and it it hurts
[51:24] some people's feelings here one time for
[51:25] me to make the statement everybody was
[51:27] talking about son of man i said why talk
[51:28] about son of man where's the son of god
[51:32] and i said would you raise your hand
[51:34] if you tell me where the son of god
[51:36] started or what is it beginning
[51:38] everybody raised me started 2 000 years
[51:40] ago
[51:45] i said no way
[51:47] i said even scofield
[51:52] even those theologians
[51:55] come back there and what did brother
[51:57] branham say in that statement while ago
[52:03] out of the logos came the son of god
[52:09] the word
[52:13] the son of god was back there because
[52:16] remember now
[52:17] listen
[52:20] you remember this with the last message
[52:22] father never created
[52:25] the son is the creator
[52:27] because he's the word
[52:31] not meaning he couldn't create
[52:34] he just
[52:35] moved over in another form and began to
[52:37] create
[52:38] now listen he moved over in another form
[52:41] and began to create and we call him the
[52:42] son
[52:43] now he who god almighty
[52:46] moved over in another form
[52:48] and we call him the son
[52:51] well who was he before then
[52:54] he was god almighty
[52:56] he moved over into another form
[52:59] and begin to say let there be
[53:03] now you can go back to genesis and when
[53:05] it says and god created the heavens and
[53:07] the earth
[53:11] and don't say back there jesus created
[53:13] the heaven and the earth
[53:14] no
[53:17] because the flesh man jesus was back
[53:19] there
[53:24] the one god is being revealed through
[53:26] the prophet and we're talking about it
[53:28] who
[53:29] or in other words what is the beginning
[53:34] are you listen to the point it took 4
[53:37] 000 years
[53:38] to come from a
[53:40] time wise come from a
[53:42] time of genesis
[53:44] 1 1.
[53:46] god created heaven it took 4 000 years
[53:53] and god finally created a body to live
[53:55] in
[54:00] now may i quote the prophet
[54:02] because back there he he finished the
[54:04] physical physical creation
[54:07] he said well jesus was yeah but that's a
[54:08] higher order
[54:12] see
[54:14] go back there with me in the thinking
[54:16] that here is almighty god
[54:19] he's dwelt alone there's nothing nobody
[54:21] with him or anything
[54:23] he's self-existing
[54:26] and he just steps over into another form
[54:32] so he created himself
[54:35] he stepped over in another form
[54:38] he became the word
[54:40] but then it took 4 000 years for that to
[54:43] materialize to be a flesh man
[54:48] right
[54:48] that's right it took 4 000 years for
[54:51] that son of god the word to keep
[54:55] creating until it would bring the
[54:56] prophets to bring the body right am i
[55:00] with the prophet
[55:02] the prophets brought the body john was
[55:04] the last one to introduce the head jesus
[55:07] christ was the head
[55:09] all right
[55:11] and there when he stepped out on the
[55:12] river jordan
[55:14] john said behold the lamb of god that
[55:17] takes away the sin of the world behold
[55:21] our almighty god in human flesh
[55:28] isn't this easy to think about
[55:30] when the prophet would say it his first
[55:32] creation was
[55:34] god himself
[55:37] not a creation like that none existed
[55:39] and he created it and because remember
[55:41] remember if you're thinking that way
[55:43] then you've got somebody over here
[55:45] creating something over there so be
[55:46] careful
[55:49] now because that's what we got to do
[55:51] and that's what i kept emphasizing in
[55:52] the last message
[55:56] brother branham said
[55:58] did
[55:59] god send a son
[56:05] i got a bunch of quotes on that if you
[56:06] want to
[56:07] did god send a son he said no he came
[56:09] himself
[56:12] see when he stepped over into another
[56:14] form he came himself he didn't do away
[56:17] with that
[56:18] to make that non-existent
[56:21] that just moved over with him
[56:26] the father
[56:28] just became the son which is god in
[56:31] another form
[56:33] right
[56:35] and seeth in that god created and we'll
[56:37] get to those times and he began to be
[56:39] into that beginning of the creation of
[56:41] god
[56:42] but yet that was not the total
[56:44] fulfillment because he would have to
[56:47] wait until
[56:49] the bride comes forth
[56:51] to be able to say
[56:53] to this age
[56:55] the beginning of the creation of god
[56:59] and meaning it's a bride amen
[57:04] you're coming right down to where you
[57:06] are
[57:07] and that's the way we're going to have
[57:08] to see it we're going to see ourselves
[57:11] and it's not god moving from one form to
[57:13] another and leave a vacuum and he gets
[57:15] over here and he gets through with this
[57:17] when he moves over and then leaves the
[57:18] vacuum leaves the vacuum leaves the
[57:20] vacuum no
[57:24] he just reveals himself
[57:27] in another form
[57:32] the finality of his natural doing
[57:35] took place in jesus christ because there
[57:38] was the sun as we read in the scripture
[57:40] in john
[57:41] the son hath the clarity
[57:45] brought him out in the open
[57:46] showed him
[57:49] right
[57:50] because what did jesus say now you ever
[57:53] thought about this what does god look
[57:54] like
[57:57] now i know i'm stupid and crazy man
[57:59] i'll get a thought every once in a while
[58:02] what's god look like
[58:08] i thank god that we've got what the
[58:09] prophet said hoffman was the closest but
[58:11] now he didn't say it with all of it but
[58:13] he said it was the closest anything he'd
[58:14] ever seen because he seen him out in the
[58:16] field
[58:18] right
[58:24] if jesus was god
[58:28] being god in another form
[58:33] his name is jesus
[58:35] he looks like jesus
[58:39] now wait a minute now
[58:40] well what did jesus look like
[58:44] jesus said i come in my father's name
[58:48] if you've seen me he said you've seen
[58:50] the father
[58:53] amen
[58:55] trying to preach one god
[59:00] trying to get one god down in a a realm
[59:02] that for 30 years i've been trying to
[59:06] so forgive me just despair with me
[59:09] if i repeat myself just
[59:10] all right just unplug that one and you
[59:12] know you can take my hearing aid
[59:14] you know you can just take one of them
[59:16] out and
[59:17] i'm not silly i'm just truthful
[59:20] i know
[59:22] and realize
[59:25] this is one thing that this man knows
[59:27] and has known for a long time
[59:29] you cannot
[59:32] change people
[59:35] you cannot change their mind
[59:40] they're going to keep that natural mind
[59:42] in their thinking
[59:43] you've got to go to the inside man
[59:48] i am not dealing with your body i am not
[59:52] dealing with your second realm spirit
[59:54] i'm dealing with your soul talking to
[59:57] you
[59:58] because what did brother branham say
[1:00:03] he said
[1:00:04] god came himself
[1:00:06] he said now in body
[1:00:09] he was a man
[1:00:11] he said but in spirit he was god
[1:00:17] in another statement he said in body he
[1:00:19] was a man he said in soul he was god
[1:00:22] so who was that man
[1:00:24] that was walking the shores of galilee
[1:00:27] god
[1:00:28] in another form called a son
[1:00:33] now what is he to be in the last days
[1:00:36] god in another form called the bride
[1:00:46] because all god was
[1:00:48] he poured into christ all christ he
[1:00:50] pours into the church
[1:00:54] then he takes that church back to the
[1:00:56] garden of eden or returns her back to
[1:00:58] where she's supposed to be
[1:01:00] or restores her may i say it this way
[1:01:02] restores her to her original position
[1:01:10] you may not think like i do and i'm i'm
[1:01:12] glad i guess maybe everybody don't but
[1:01:16] i look at the things brother branham are
[1:01:17] saying
[1:01:21] and i said well see you look there he he
[1:01:24] he made a man in the garden that made
[1:01:26] him god
[1:01:27] he was already god
[1:01:32] he was already god
[1:01:34] he always was god
[1:01:36] he never was anything else
[1:01:39] he just was not made manifest
[1:01:43] see jesus come to declare or to bring
[1:01:46] him out in the open
[1:01:50] he said i do nothing until my father
[1:01:53] shows me
[1:01:56] brother brandon what did he say he said
[1:01:58] he didn't do nothing without a vision
[1:02:00] no i wouldn't be glad to give you these
[1:02:02] because he's
[1:02:05] he said he
[1:02:07] didn't do nothing without a vision he
[1:02:09] said that's why i
[1:02:11] wait on him
[1:02:14] he waited for a vision
[1:02:17] waited for an interpretation or a
[1:02:19] thought
[1:02:21] but listen
[1:02:22] to lead out or go before
[1:02:26] see beginning can be go before all right
[1:02:29] what's he going before
[1:02:34] he's moving from one existence
[1:02:38] to another existence
[1:02:40] and he doesn't lose anything
[1:02:43] everything in this existence goes with
[1:02:45] him
[1:02:48] and then when he pours it into the
[1:02:49] church all that's in existence of him
[1:02:52] all the way down is finalized and
[1:02:54] pouring into the
[1:03:00] church that's why i like that the
[1:03:03] scripture there where it says you know
[1:03:05] uh this is my son in whom i'm pleased to
[1:03:08] dwell well i think he says that every
[1:03:10] time he gives out the new birth
[1:03:12] if he gives you the baptism of the holy
[1:03:14] ghost he is pleased to dwell now you
[1:03:16] tell me i'm wrong there i'll just ask
[1:03:18] you what reasonable sense you got
[1:03:20] because if he's in there he's pleased to
[1:03:22] be there
[1:03:24] right because he ain't going to force
[1:03:26] him in there
[1:03:29] no it's going to be a pleasing factor
[1:03:34] so then what was it
[1:03:36] the first creation
[1:03:39] was god himself
[1:03:44] now
[1:03:50] go to number five
[1:03:52] brothers
[1:03:56] let's get number five i'm jumping over a
[1:03:58] couple but
[1:04:01] you got it
[1:04:03] number five
[1:04:07] now when he said here that he emptied
[1:04:09] himself or poured himself now we would
[1:04:12] think like this that he vomited up
[1:04:15] now see that's our terminologies that's
[1:04:17] our words that mean that word that's
[1:04:19] used for there to empty himself up
[1:04:22] is to vomit out that's human
[1:04:24] terminologies to explain it
[1:04:28] that he vomited up the english word of
[1:04:30] emptied are poured out from him see
[1:04:33] something went out of him that was
[1:04:36] different from him now there's your
[1:04:38] beginning that looks like see
[1:04:41] something went out it was different
[1:04:42] because listen but the word kinos
[1:04:45] in the greek does not mean that he
[1:04:48] vomited up
[1:04:49] or or his arm went off or his eye went
[1:04:52] out or another person that is he changed
[1:04:54] himself
[1:04:56] he poured himself into another
[1:04:59] itself into amen into another mask
[1:05:04] into another form
[1:05:06] not
[1:05:07] another person went out of him
[1:05:10] called the holy spirit amen but it was
[1:05:13] he himself
[1:05:15] said you get it
[1:05:17] god all the fullness of godhead bodily
[1:05:19] was in that person jesus christ he was
[1:05:22] god and god alone not a third person
[1:05:25] or a second person or a first person
[1:05:30] now that explained that one
[1:05:34] but the person god veiled in human flesh
[1:05:40] he wasn't the third person second person
[1:05:42] or the first person he wasn't the first
[1:05:43] one he was the person of almighty god
[1:05:46] that's why he's not like the wind
[1:05:47] blowing
[1:05:48] he's a being
[1:05:51] [Music]
[1:05:52] but see he stepped out
[1:05:56] in other words moved out into another
[1:05:57] form
[1:06:00] okay now listen
[1:06:03] get natural with it for a minute
[1:06:07] all right there was a time when donnie
[1:06:09] was
[1:06:09] born as a baby
[1:06:12] you know
[1:06:13] all right
[1:06:15] well see you know what he
[1:06:17] he's changed forms since then
[1:06:20] right
[1:06:22] but did he change persons
[1:06:25] no he's still the same person
[1:06:28] he just changed his form
[1:06:30] he just moved from one place to another
[1:06:33] place
[1:06:35] you know how i've always tried to
[1:06:37] explain it
[1:06:38] brother vote you he'd say and a lot of
[1:06:40] people believe in like god uh in the
[1:06:44] backyard in uh
[1:06:46] the upper room he said it's like taking
[1:06:48] an apple and cut it up and you pass out
[1:06:50] to pieces and you run out of apple and
[1:06:52] ain't got nothing left
[1:06:53] he said that ain't it
[1:06:58] well what is it like the fish that he'd
[1:07:01] take
[1:07:02] and the bread
[1:07:04] that he handed out when he reached back
[1:07:05] there's more
[1:07:08] there was more
[1:07:09] on the day of pentecost he went from
[1:07:13] one person
[1:07:15] to 3120.
[1:07:21] that's a pretty good increase
[1:07:25] how would you like to put a few dollars
[1:07:26] in the bank if they'd let you do it you
[1:07:28] know
[1:07:30] and you'd go for that
[1:07:32] and then you'd have a pile of money in
[1:07:33] just a little bit
[1:07:36] but think about it see that's what i was
[1:07:37] trying to get across the last minute get
[1:07:40] it to the point of this one thing
[1:07:45] god never sent another person
[1:07:49] i see trinitarian concept right
[1:07:53] god never sent another person
[1:07:55] he came himself
[1:07:58] to live in his people
[1:08:01] came to die
[1:08:04] as a human being
[1:08:05] to do that he had to take on another
[1:08:07] form
[1:08:08] there's where he's declaring the father
[1:08:11] see
[1:08:13] he didn't declare the father too much in
[1:08:15] genesis and all like that
[1:08:18] but one day a man walked
[1:08:20] on the shores of galilee
[1:08:23] that man was almighty god
[1:08:27] in body
[1:08:28] he was a human element
[1:08:31] in spirit he was a spirit man
[1:08:34] but in soul
[1:08:35] it was almighty god
[1:08:43] they killed him because he said you're a
[1:08:44] man making yourself god
[1:08:48] no
[1:08:49] he was god making himself a man
[1:08:52] god manifesting himself in a man form
[1:08:56] being a person
[1:08:59] when we get dire as i say and want to go
[1:09:00] we're going to see jesus
[1:09:04] won't that be wonderful
[1:09:06] you know that's what i said i like about
[1:09:08] it because see if we're going to believe
[1:09:09] brother branham now he didn't say that
[1:09:11] hoffman was exactly he said it's close
[1:09:15] well we know close to what jesus looks
[1:09:17] like
[1:09:19] but did you catch what i said a while
[1:09:20] ago
[1:09:23] jesus looked like his father
[1:09:26] because he was his father made manifest
[1:09:33] well what are we talking about
[1:09:36] we've seen jesus
[1:09:38] the bible said
[1:09:40] we have handled with our own hands
[1:09:45] now that was when jesus came into human
[1:09:47] flesh right
[1:09:49] the disciples and the things they've
[1:09:50] washed his feet they've done the things
[1:09:52] you know they
[1:09:58] what do you think about
[1:10:00] god
[1:10:05] we're going to pick up the next one
[1:10:06] where brother brown said he goes into
[1:10:08] the next point of saying
[1:10:11] that he gave birth to his son
[1:10:17] but don't forget this
[1:10:19] he never gave birth to another person
[1:10:24] he just stepped over in another form
[1:10:30] he became the father made manifest
[1:10:39] think on these things church
[1:10:42] what are we looking at what are we
[1:10:44] trying to find
[1:10:50] brother brother said
[1:10:52] most people think that god created jesus
[1:10:54] and jesus created everything else he
[1:10:56] said now that's incorrect
[1:11:03] no
[1:11:06] god just stepped into another form
[1:11:12] and when that form was
[1:11:16] not to be say it come out it went out or
[1:11:18] run out or whatever but when it
[1:11:20] fulfilled its time
[1:11:22] he stepped into another form
[1:11:24] called the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:11:28] the same god the same jehovah god
[1:11:32] that came on the day of pentecost in the
[1:11:34] baptism of the holy ghost was the same
[1:11:36] eternal god that back before the world
[1:11:38] ever begun whatever they're doing and he
[1:11:41] said
[1:11:42] i'm going to just start this and let's
[1:11:44] see what it you know let it be right
[1:11:47] we'll get to that back into some of
[1:11:48] these brothers and pick up their
[1:11:49] thoughts what because see
[1:11:54] if you think about foreknowledge
[1:12:01] you realize how far you can go back
[1:12:02] before knowledge
[1:12:04] you go back as far as there's a god to
[1:12:06] be thought of
[1:12:08] for knowledge
[1:12:12] he didn't predestinate by his desires
[1:12:15] he predestinated by his foreign
[1:12:16] knowledge because he knew what was going
[1:12:18] to happen
[1:12:22] see but he knew
[1:12:25] that when he created man
[1:12:29] he knew
[1:12:31] he would have to die
[1:12:35] but he knew he couldn't do it
[1:12:37] in the form he was in
[1:12:41] he couldn't do it as a baby laying in a
[1:12:42] cradle or a teenager running he couldn't
[1:12:44] do it in none of that
[1:12:47] he couldn't do it in the spiritual realm
[1:12:50] and it be done that's the point that we
[1:12:52] look at
[1:12:53] remember the two creations we tried to
[1:12:55] cover
[1:12:57] spiritual realm
[1:12:58] natural realm
[1:13:00] first he created
[1:13:02] the the spirit man
[1:13:05] because it was in the image of god so
[1:13:07] what does god look like that's the man
[1:13:09] that he made
[1:13:10] that sense well enough
[1:13:12] right
[1:13:13] then
[1:13:15] coming staging stages stages just simply
[1:13:18] moving down
[1:13:20] unveiling himself
[1:13:24] now he would never be happy i'm going
[1:13:26] back to that
[1:13:29] dedication of the
[1:13:31] church
[1:13:33] god was happy with moses and
[1:13:36] the things that he done
[1:13:38] he proved it he came down
[1:13:41] they couldn't minister
[1:13:44] he proved he was happy in
[1:13:47] solomon
[1:13:48] when he came down
[1:13:50] and just
[1:13:52] you know you think about it i i remember
[1:13:55] thinking one day how many
[1:13:56] animals would be being killed in one day
[1:14:00] and just hundreds of thousands of
[1:14:02] animals being killed
[1:14:06] all of that going up and you say my
[1:14:08] morning
[1:14:11] not if you're god
[1:14:16] not if you're god and you're looking
[1:14:17] down and saying
[1:14:19] that's covering for sin
[1:14:23] but then when he looked at it he says
[1:14:24] that's covering but it'll only cover
[1:14:27] till the story is finished
[1:14:29] because david's gonna i mean solomon's
[1:14:32] gonna build me a
[1:14:33] building
[1:14:34] that's gonna stay there but it ain't
[1:14:36] gonna work i'm gonna have to step down
[1:14:38] in human flesh
[1:14:40] not send a son not another person or
[1:14:43] anything step down himself into another
[1:14:45] form
[1:14:47] and become
[1:14:49] the son of man
[1:14:55] he didn't say i'm a son of god
[1:14:57] because that was the situation to be
[1:14:59] declared later that when the bride of
[1:15:02] christ would come forth with the baptism
[1:15:04] of the holy ghost if seven church ages
[1:15:06] it would be son of god
[1:15:09] and the age is the son of god
[1:15:11] see right at the end as son of man just
[1:15:13] for a little bit
[1:15:16] now may i say it just a little bit on
[1:15:18] the thoughts
[1:15:20] you know that the son of man is the only
[1:15:21] sower of the seed according to the bible
[1:15:26] the son of man's on sword deceit son of
[1:15:28] god didn't sow no seed
[1:15:30] son of man sowed the seeds of entire new
[1:15:33] testament
[1:15:34] he sowed the seed of his bride
[1:15:37] that way he was the father he wanted to
[1:15:39] be
[1:15:43] when all of this can be comprehended and
[1:15:46] come down
[1:15:48] and dwell here with us and we can see it
[1:15:50] and then we can see just as far that
[1:15:52] away or that away and see the whole
[1:15:54] thing
[1:15:55] and say thank you lord
[1:15:58] thank you
[1:16:00] but see
[1:16:02] don't forget these things until i get
[1:16:04] back to
[1:16:09] god
[1:16:11] came himself
[1:16:16] and died for our sins
[1:16:24] he made us his offspring
[1:16:27] his children
[1:16:31] he created his own bridegroom
[1:16:34] i mean a bride the bridegroom created
[1:16:36] his own bride
[1:16:42] think on these things
[1:16:45] look
[1:16:52] all through eternity
[1:16:54] he would always be known
[1:16:56] as the i am
[1:17:01] because that would be his name
[1:17:05] but yet
[1:17:08] i am
[1:17:10] would not finish the story
[1:17:14] but jesus does
[1:17:18] brother brown says on what is what is
[1:17:21] who is this melchizedek
[1:17:24] knowing all things all places
[1:17:27] because of his omniscience
[1:17:30] on the presence he's omniscient makes
[1:17:32] him
[1:17:34] omnipresent he is a being
[1:17:37] he's not like the wind he's a being
[1:17:40] he dwells in a house
[1:17:51] i remember reading here a while back not
[1:17:53] too long ago that bill gates built a 50
[1:17:55] million house sitting on this hillside
[1:17:58] ocean side or something would that be
[1:18:00] something for a 50 million dollar house
[1:18:07] god made his out of pure gold
[1:18:11] but it's not fear gold his house is in
[1:18:13] you
[1:18:16] that was what made him happy when he
[1:18:17] could come and live
[1:18:21] what about today
[1:18:23] when he can live in his bride and she
[1:18:25] can know who she is
[1:18:28] and comprehend come on musician
[1:18:30] comprehend
[1:18:31] and all but just keep that in mind
[1:18:37] what does beginning mean to you
[1:18:41] we went from eternity to eternity
[1:18:44] and never had a starting point nor
[1:18:46] stopping point
[1:18:49] i hope you listen that way to what i'm
[1:18:51] saying i never had a starting point or a
[1:18:54] stopping point
[1:18:57] you say yeah you did because now you
[1:18:58] just go back there and you just keep on
[1:19:00] going
[1:19:02] and what about the prophet saying
[1:19:04] that he had a house
[1:19:08] well god don't need a house now we we
[1:19:10] know all of that
[1:19:12] he didn't need a temple in the
[1:19:13] wilderness he didn't need those
[1:19:14] buildings
[1:19:15] but they were put there
[1:19:20] what about it
[1:19:23] a body thou has prepared me
[1:19:27] a place for god to dwell
[1:19:31] the way he wanted it
[1:19:33] in his bride
[1:19:36] that he creates by the word
[1:19:40] think on these things let's stand
[1:19:41] together
[1:19:44] [Music]
[1:19:46] victory
[1:19:48] just think about him and what he's
[1:19:50] trying to show us
[1:19:53] no
[1:19:55] story
[1:19:57] our savior came
[1:19:59] from glory
[1:20:01] how he made
[1:20:07] [Music]
[1:20:09] anybody have a need
[1:20:11] just remember
[1:20:13] he's all in all he's always been there
[1:20:21] he always was god he was just not made
[1:20:24] known
[1:20:25] until the angels worshiped him as that
[1:20:27] word god
[1:20:32] all right
[1:20:33] but it doesn't change him
[1:20:37] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:20:39] forever
[1:20:40] [Music]
[1:20:51] now we're going to have to take the
[1:20:52] whole thing of what we covered
[1:20:54] and step back and say okay
[1:20:58] now we got a beginning
[1:21:01] now we can start the creation of the
[1:21:03] world
[1:21:04] [Music]
[1:21:09] you got to get all that straight to know
[1:21:11] who he is and what's going on then you
[1:21:12] can look back and say okay now the world
[1:21:15] began
[1:21:15] [Music]
[1:21:20] but remember
[1:21:22] man was made before the world
[1:21:26] as a spiritual being
[1:21:27] [Music]
[1:21:31] one day he became a literal
[1:21:34] being
[1:21:35] person
[1:21:39] think on these things
[1:21:44] [Music]
[1:21:53] he loved me
[1:21:57] [Music]
[1:22:02] see father son and holy ghost is not
[1:22:04] three god
[1:22:05] [Music]
[1:22:07] it's three ways of that god manifesting
[1:22:10] himself
[1:22:11] [Music]
[1:22:13] or revealing himself or declaring
[1:22:15] himself
[1:22:16] [Music]
[1:22:21] it's the same one god
[1:22:27] [Music]
[1:22:31] and the old redemption
[1:22:35] and somehow hey i'll sing up there what
[1:22:39] about him
[1:22:41] he's reeling
[1:22:44] oh victory
[1:22:46] in jesus
[1:22:48] my savior
[1:22:50] forever
[1:22:52] he sought me
[1:22:54] and he bought me
[1:22:56] with his
[1:22:58] redeeming blood
[1:23:00] he loved me
