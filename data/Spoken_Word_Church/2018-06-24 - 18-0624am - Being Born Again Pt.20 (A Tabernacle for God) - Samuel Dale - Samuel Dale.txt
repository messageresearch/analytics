just be with that bless each one God and direct us in your love forgive our sins because we want to stand completing you and just have your way in Jesus name any man first Peter seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren since you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible what by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever let's go over to Hebrews 10 for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with such sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers darn to perfect now what's the point there's things it this can't be done it can't make the perfect make the person perfect if it's into those lines and things and I watch that as we tie it with the message as we go along for would they not have ceased to be offered because if the worshiper once purged should have no more conscious of sin but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made us in every year or it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body thou has prepared and me all right now let's go to Scripture was using their last Sunday will go to first Thessalonians and the very God of peace sanctify you wholly and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless under the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now trying to continue the thought alone on what we were talking on last weekend and just to try to see if we can follow that point but what what I want us to see is you know we talked about as let's get to point C then we'll try to go on you know we have studied the message we have come to the basis of finding a lot of truth in the Word of God all right now one of those truths is that we found that a Christian now a Christian is the only one that can sin sinners condemned on a higher level but a Christian is the only one that can see in now we got to find out how that and we went to that how that that Christian cannot sin from his inner being of the soul all right no you understand that he can't sin from dark because that's where Christ build all right but he sins in his body his spirit all right his body is worth nothing you know no anything at all without that spirit to make it work all right so the problem is in the spirit realm of mankind that we see those were our trouble is the memory reason conscience affections and things DARS were we have our trouble all right see then that way we're not born again you remember Sunday we're not born again in our body you're not born again in your spirit you're born again in your soul which is the center part of you the N word being ours were we're born again at all right now and we found those things to be marvelous for understanding purposes because it's always been a thing you know we'll do we see in order can we see in our are we as Christians do we do this or what do we do and if we see in where do we sin from you know like that well then those things should be settled by now as we've studied the message of the Prophet bringing out the points and seeing you know that a Christian a born-again Christian does have problems and troubles alright but not in that soul because the soul is born again alright it's pure it's holy Satan can't get into where you're at because you're sealed in sin he's sealed out alright now to hold that then we see that we do wrong in our spirit realm and our body really all like body does is displays it's worth nothing because you tap him in the head knock him out and he's done you know there's nothing that can be done like that it you don't reason and all that you do all of that through your spirit realm you know because your new body you just out see taste feel smell in here all right now so remember that now and and that would be very needful and helpful to understand the Christian journey and that way we don't go wrong all right now but I've tried to hoot to a little bit darkness past Sunday to try to make a point about the you know who we are that we're a triune being alright now one part of us gone we're not worth anything right it takes the tribe to try on the body the spirit the soul to make us a being a person an individual take one of those away you're not complete things won't work you know take it any any part of those three away so just remember then now remember that in no way would we ever try to go in the wrong room and just say well you know it don't matter what I do it's not me that's doing it it's a citizen my spirit well now it be careful with that because that can be true you know that that's right it can be true all right but what if we don't have that inward being in the right way what if it's not born again what if it's not pure then we've got problems right that was the whole point of trying to get you to see from Sunday you know that the that we're a triune being and being that triune being then it takes those three to make us work alright one without the other it won't work this will evolve any one of the three you have no way for it to work yeah alright see the cold it's got to be in that room so then let's don't try to justify and say well well it's really I'm glad we found out that a Christian sins from the spirit and I'm glad we found that out because that that's just that spirit doing it it's not me you might ought to remember this fear it is you right all right it's just the basis that we order come to a point of realization and the truth of it is what that that soul cannot sin because his seed remaineth in us according to the scripture and that soul cannot sin all right but the body the spirit realm can do wrong so then we don't just well it's not me it's my body in my spirit that's going wrong see when you start doing like that's your propping up things right you're making excuses for what you're doing you're trying to justify your point instead of being truthful all right just keep in mind that what I'm trying to say then because we're one being we're being we're one being body spirit and soul all right now all of that and that takes that to make me so then if I can't just go along say well that's not really me because that's my spirit and that's my body come on that's the body you've lived in all your life and that's the spirit that has come into that that's made us into the rim of to be able to you know memory reason conscious affections and times all right that was why I was ending up the services Sunday we'll get back a little more later to it but ending it up talking about the fact that those virtues work out through your spirit right the nature of God is with inside in the soul sealed in all right but then working back out through that spirit realm is supposed to come in to being God's nature working in our spirit realm all right so then the the virtues would work out through the spirit is not to just say no this it's not to say that the virtues are the spirit no no I don't see you you go wrong to say the virtues of the spirit now the virtues work through the spirit that spirit room is in us and no matter what you do you can't operate without the spirit realm and naturally you won't operate without the body so then don't get it to where that we can say well well okay then then it's really not me okay listen see where we're trying to justify something to make it work for our own our own way of thinking instead of saying my whole being thing if you see me go out and rob a bank well that wasn't my soul well where was that i right it was that robbing the bank right see that's why we try to take things and even though though we find truth will overrun the truth and try to make it work on out into other realms instead of being truthful about it my spirit is what's giving me trouble but you know what that's not your spirit giving me trouble right that's not your spirit giving me trouble it's my spirit that gives me trouble it's my spirit that has to be brought under control because come on what is there supposed to be it's supposed to be the soul controlling the spirit the spirit controlling the body right because the soul is the center rim the part of us that guides us and keeps us that is if you're born again that is Christ coming and living in you bring in his nature his everything within you to try to let it then work back out well I just can't happen it I just can't help it you know I I know I've got a little temper here and I just can't help it now what are you doing you're trying to justify something instead of facing up front just get it right that's where we'll get into the virtues when the Prophet when he gets in not to worry says that you know virtue and what it is and then temperance and what it is you know we'll didn't see we'll go on the other side of it a lot of time and we'll say Oh what but you know I'm a Christian and and I don't have no wrong calls you might not have no wrong thoughts but you just lied is that plain enough I didn't break it down and smile that's as plain as it can be you just lied C to say you never have any wrong thoughts as you lied about it uh-huh see that way you're not facing it honestly to say that we are a human being and brother branham will come up here to temperance and he'll say this controlling that temper well I didn't thank you Chris you had a temper no I think we need to get everything in the right order all right but now we are a triune being okay body spirit and soul then we know that the message in Prior we've been through it that you tank can take and the but random will cover in his early ministry body soul spirit then when he comes into the last part of his ministry especially back into the 65 he'll come to body spirit and soul because that way the Bible lines up he got it lined up because the Bible says the soul that sinneth it shall die it doesn't say the spirit that's in it because that spirits going to do wrong they don't mean you got to but I just can't help it well maybe we need to do a lot of praying that might change a lot of things if we do a lot of praying to try to get over that all right now see that was what I was trying to bring out and bring out the point of what see then the soul is the center part of man all right then that comes out wordly to control the spirit realm the spirit automatically controls the body alright see that way we've got it in order to her that we can follow the Christian life and see what's going on but never forget and I wanted to put this point in to make sure we don't never forget that your body and spirit is a part of your being you don't don't try to isolate it well my soul that's what my real mean well now come on you say well one of these days we don't get rid of this old body that's why they taught it in the organizations and the people of this message teach it that you don't get a new body you know a lot of people in this message after all that brought around them instead of I still believe you're gonna get a new body another body I want this body made new right because this is the body I've lived in okay this is my being this is Who I am but I want God to work from the inside out through that alright now as you'll see then the statue of a perfect man that's where it comes in so valuable because that it does work now listen it works back out from the inward part into our spirit realm and we've got to bring that under control well I just can't help it well then you're not trying at least we could try right you know we could do something that away alright because see we are not a complete unit unless we're body spirit and soul take off any part you're not a complete unit alright you won't work so then we we know then that the soul is the part that's born again the soul then controls the spirit the spirit controls the body that brings the whole unit into being to manifest Christianity in our journey in life all right the because we're not born again their body we're not going to get in their spirit but they do play a part see without your body spirit it wouldn't work God has to contact us through the body here right see taste feel smell in here all right he doesn't just open us up and go pour stuff in you don't know he has to work through the rim and what's so amazing I don't understand how he does it but I don't understand how Satan does it either I can understand him do any better than I can understand God doing it because God won't dwell in an unclean vessel and I know these vessels are unclean but yet he will take that and work through it and use it to bring us to the right place all right because we're coming to the Christian journey okay making the part that we see what's controlling us that it's Christ in you the hope of glory is him controlling us but knowing and for surety and realizing that we're human beings and human beings in this body as long as we're in this body we will how trouble none see you take the profit and then you'll try to justify this try to justify that the prophet said as long as we're in this body will be a sticker okay now well I just can't have it I'm just gonna be a sticker God wants me to be a sticker I won't be a good sticker yeah that's kind of stupidity in it that's the best way to say it let's see we try to justify things to try to make it work it won't work repentance is the best time the best way to get rid of anything is repent of it I think you try to justify it or hide it or or cover it or you know it's just this repent alright because you've got to be a complete unit before God can use you already following enough because he's a complete unit the God's a complete unit God is body spirit and soul just like your body spirit and soul so then he can work through those realms and as I said a moment ago how does he get through when one time I'm having wrong thoughts and the second time that this right from that all at once God comes through that and brings some of the most beautiful thoughts into your mind you ever done that no come on have you ever done it I mean you're actually having wrong thoughts something going wrong problems and troubles you know I don't mean getting out and running like crazy I'm just saying human human being well God comes right through that and speaks to us right that's marvelous so then where would you be without a body that he could use to speak through where would you be without a spirit for him to be able to come down and as the Bible says come let us reason together God sits down in their spirit sometimes in research with us right I mean that might not be too good of language but it's his truth he does deal with us through our spirit realm see because he is body spirit and soul that's what God is a real person okay now we know to bring the Godhead into complete order and making it right the great eternal God existed before the world had desires and all of that and then he came down to earth and when he did that soul is the very soul of Almighty God all right talking about Jesus Christ as he came into birth the very soul is a very soul of Almighty God his spirit was the very spirit of Almighty God and his body was created that's why we read in Hebrews 10 5 was that a body that has prepared me now see he he made a body to come and live in it now there is a fulfillment of his desires right he made a body and come to live in it now think about it or what we're trying to get to God has always wanted a tabernacle a dwelling place all right so Moses is taken up to heaven sees things comes back to earth and we'll read it in a second and he builds on earth through skins and in tents or whatever you wanna call it you know and stuff like that he builds our brains into being what he saw in heaven which was a dwelling place of God through God dwelt in the tent back there that was made that was a dwelling place so he started off his earthly journey not as a body spirit and soul man he started his journey in life as to a tabernacle that he could come and dwell in and Moses built that tabernacle they started off with a tent right unless that's the best way you can do it he started off with skins and he was making it but remember then what we're talking about what God wanted Moses built but that was that's complete that just started his existence upon earth or whatever you want to call it to fellowship with mankind and he started it with a tent in the journey so let's go ahead and get started and we'll read some scriptures and go ahead with number one we bypassed 1a because 1a is the rapture we read around is explaining how the inward being as the sole this second rim is the spirit the outside is the body all right now look what he says now this is the scriptures taken from acts 7 this is actually part of what was used as a statue of a perfect man all right look our fathers had a tabernacle of witness in the wilderness as he had appointed speaking under Moses that he should make it according to the fashion he had seen now I like to think like this what did Moses see did Moses did God take Moses up and he saw tent you know skins our thing now he saw the tabernacle of Almighty God okay he saw the body before it came into being now listen to what I'm saying did he just see a tent and see this that did he come back and built out all right that's fine David comes over and look what all he does in Solomon and builds a wonderful tabernacle way more marvelous in appearance than the tent that Moses had but yet God was pleased to dwell in that tent then they brought it to earth but understand what I'm saying see look according to the fashion he had seen we see I don't think like I know I'm crazy I don't think like everybody else I'm crazy but I love it sometimes you know what because see I love to think about not that Moses is up in heaven and he's seeing it tent and he said y'all go back down and I'll build this and I'll put this and I'll put that he's a prophet he doesn't need that all he needs is to see what God won't God won't somebody God won't back down a dwelling place right because remember he so he spirit Almighty God but he has no earthly form of dwelling place you'd be in a theophany he'd be in the forms like that different things but not in a being I mean not in a tell and he's not in a being flesh at that time so then Moses he builds it according to what he's seen that's why it's wonderful to me you know I I kind of heard something the other day brother was telling me about that this passenger said he didn't want his wife to know anything about the message or something no as much I guess that he did but I'm kinda little bit different from that I want my wife to know the what God is to her I believe that's what it's supposed to be I believe it's Christ to her as well it is to me you know all right now not throw stones are just making the point that the I want you to have your understanding of what you see and see that way you'll see more like Moses sees things you'll be taken up to see a marvelous beautiful things but it was Jesus Christ and sisters see you say well we don't have nothing to do you know how I've always said it and I believe it so you could sit down with some of those old customers Jews and talk to them your sisters could and explaining that say well what's this what's that you remember brother branham talking about that rabbi those two lows and he said I never seen that that was what he's supposed to been studying he said he'd never seen it see I believe in something real I don't disbelieve in imaginary things and it and he's Moses went up and he saw this great big tent and he come back and build it on earth that's all right you want to think that way I think he went up so Jesus Christ he saw Almighty God he come to earth and tried to build a tabernacle God watch it as we go along so he tried to be already seen which also our fathers that came forth came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles whom God drove out before the face of our fathers unto the days of David who found favor before God and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob the you can look at David more than you'll see it in Moses but David longed to build God a dwelling place he didn't get to cause it too much sin that's like but he desired that and he sure didn't do a lot cuz he got everything ready for Solomon didn't it don't leave David out of it he got everything ready Solomon I don't that dude just put it together he just assembled it David had everything but going cuz he loved it who found favor for guarding desired to build a tabernacle for the God of Jacob always been something that man wants to build a place for God if we get over there far enough remember on the Mount of Transfiguration Peter named said let us build three Tabernacles even though they had come through all of that and seen all that they still was trying to build Tabernacles with Solomon building my house now howbeit the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands let's say if the Prophet heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool what house will you build me saith the Lord or what is the place of my rest then listen to it howbeit the most I dwell if not in temples made with hands let's say if the Prophet heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool what house will you build me there was what can you build that would be to my satisfaction of what I want is if the Lord or what is the place of my rest a house of tabernacle of light is for you to go sit down rest cool off you know no build it look our statement that God made and remember this is God talking huh heavens my throne earth my foots too well will you build meself the Lord or what is the place of my rest hath not my hand made all these things Solomon built a beautiful masterpiece of a tabernacle and all of those things but you know if you read that correctly you'll see one come up he had to take what was on earth to make that out of if God wanted to build his house he could have made the whole thing out of pure gold right that's what he's saying he said in other words you you want to build me a house but what house can you build me I can build my own house I can make it to work that I'd have everything perfect what said I'm not gonna do it and we'll let you hit and we'll let you be part of it right so then we know that what he started Moses he saw the what he saw and come back and build it he built it out of skin he made it to look like skins and things trying to build what he thought the tabernacle of God looked like see that's why I love to listen to the Prophet and it is amazing to me to think you don't ever think what do you know right around him he'll be just coming along and let's see he was thinking yesterday was honest on something that sister explained it but he would try to brother round him which would come to her to a place that he has no answer to the question right but he says we're going to get into these things to the trumpets you remember he was planning on doing it well see he didn't even know what they were other than when he was reading we get a profit once he started reading that if you're listening when that profit when I read it I'll read this out of the other I read Moses do this make a curtains around this way make it out of this skin and make this out of that skin and make this to come over like that and like this to do that you know that's the best I can read what a prophet sees what everything in there means and that it ever be pointed to Jesus Christ badger skin all the things everything dar spoke of Jesus Christ that's what Moses saw in heaven was Jesus Christ come to earth and try to describe him well once he left the rims of the Eternity and come to earth he come back to mortal and coming back to mortal then he could only describe what he saw in mortal language he saw a tent he saw this he saw yet he saw an opening he saw a thing he saw you know the the candlesticks he saw all of the things and begin to try to describe but every bit of that is describing Jesus Christ everything in nurse describing Jesus Christ now if you look at it and follow him Tomba then you'll see that David you know pulled up Solomon comes in and Solomon is just trying to do the same things he's trying to put in stone just like Enoch enoch built the pyramid right in stone but what was he building he was building Jesus Christ in stone because he was a prophet see a prophet knows what - how to build things we said well they hate him make sure you put this here make sure all right and Moses ever studied a little bit in the lineup of Moses Moses could go in and out of the temple the top of everybody else better stay out Moses could move in and out Joshua could even move into a certain room because he was chosen for that part but he couldn't go on with Moses he'd have to come throw far steady your Bible no wonder Joshua knew all about all the things Joshua's chosen of Moses once he he come back with right report he was chosen of Moses to be right with him and the Bible says Joshua stayed in the temple but in other words the tabernacle he was in the building he might not have been behind a holy of Holy's ain't saying that I'm just saying he was right in there he would know everything because he was chosen to be there right that's the way I love to do the word but look God said I could have built what I wanted I can make me a house I can do this what said I wants you to do it told Moses build it for his time Solomon built it for his time enoch built it for his time each one of them marvelous and stone would build Jesus Christ in stone they took it see Almighty God you go into pyramids well you got justification same case baptism when I go you've got the seven steps going into the inverted seal into going up you got you got all kind of things that's in the Bible well are you following me see Church what I'm trying to get you to see is one time he said if I wanted to build a house I would build it out of what I wanted to build it out of I said but that's not what I'm wanting but said you're doing the best you can do do what you're doing David you can't do it but get everything ready Solomon is gonna build me a house and he did but you know each one of those things the pyramid is the only one that's left in time right the pyramid is the only one that's left in time Moses all of that skins all of that scone Solomon build a temple marvelous and wonderful as it is it's gone because you know what that was only God's dwelling place for a time sure he's happy to dwell there but he was looking forward to something else looking forward until it would come to work that it would be more wonderful right all right now so we get through and seeing that it's coming down but watch one gamma then all at once after all of these things are built and are torn down and the best you can do is what is it hey guy I've got it in to thank you guys talking about the building of the temple remodeling and bringing it back the house of God and he said to the latter house is greater than the former I wonder why you sit down when how could he have made anything greater than Solomon you understand what I'm getting at when they were rebuilding some of that walls they just took old rough stuff and picked it up and stuck it in made walls it ain't not the beauty that it was in the days of Solomon the days of Solomon everything was hewn cut made to fit don't go there look when they started back when hey guiding them started they were just they didn't saw the Timbers but I mean the the rocks and I thought they just picked up what they could put and made a temple but the Bible says the latter house was greater than the former you know why because restoration the faith of the fathers is a wonderful thing and was a great thing for the time I hope you following me the restoration to bring back the faith of the father's will bring it into a greater meaning and greater depth of understanding than in the original house that Paul and him had because in this one it went on from the faith of the father's all the way to the bringing of the headstone the prophets message right God keeps unfolding what he wanted to do but you know what he come over so far and he stopped he said okay now that's it since now I'm stepping on the scene and I'm gonna build my own body I'm gonna build my own tabernacle you've done wonderful you've done your part you put it in stone but said now I'm gonna build my own Hebrews 10 5 a body God didn't want to build it up 10 that was for time he just used it for a time knowing it would be destroyed a great big monstrosity of a temple until he would even say if you're any were just looked at the temple and out here he honored daddy glory into that but one day as toward huh you know what the second house come up you know what the day come it was tore down because it's not - not what God wanted is not what he wanted to be complete now are you listening that's why you see it if you listen we started out talking about what we're trying being we're a body with spirit we're soul a try on being God is a try on being the soul is Almighty God the spirit with Almighty God the body was created for him to step into to the place that he would now listen to I'm saying all those other temples were destroyed but don't you think that temple was destroyed because they beat it and cut it and split it and down with it it stepped right into eternity so don't take that one and try to do away with it now because you come to the right place all right because you come into the scriptures see you get into Matthew when he comes to the River Jordan dark God had come into being because of little virgin had give birth to a man and brought him into being that sold in that spirit was Almighty God that body had a beginning it was not eternal because showing what he was going to be alright and see then he comes forth to his time to beginning his ministry on the River Jordan that comes forth and what does it say this is my beloved son whom I'm pleased to dwell in other words this is my body now this is my tabernacle I built it you build all them others you handled all that you've done wonderful because it's all as dire for speaking of what I was to bring forth but now I'm stepping forth myself Almighty guard stepping into human flesh don't try to do away with his crown being so don't try to do away with your crown be keep it your body spirit and so you got a right to do all of those thoughts but see now watch what I'm getting at cause it's gonna go into the statute of perfect Lana cuz that's what i'ma doing with it but he says on the river Jordan this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell right then he spends three and a half years tutoring training child training that human element wooden trying to train the soul or the spirit he's training that human element that body the human element that would fit the rest of him the body of the soul in the spirit is pure and perfect they don't need nothing the body didn't need nothing because of it being sin it needed something because it was a beginning it had a beginning but now he's building it then what's wrong talk about a body thou hast prepared me the rent said the father provided that body through the Virgin Mary one that he could step into himself God stepped into that body at the birth right and lived in that body brought him up through life gave him a tutor and brought him all the way the Holy Spirit I only do what my father tells me than what he said comes up through life and he comes out to a place where he says this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell but that wouldn't have finished with a story that wasn't the finishing of it that wasn't a completion of that body even though brother Ron said right there the body was redeemed on the River Jordan but then he still had three and a half years of ministry and then he comes over into Matthew 17 this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell listen here you him now quote brother branham he said God simply was saying if you get anything else from now on now I'm paraphrasing it but it's pretty close if you get anything else from now on you're going to get it from him see they didn't want to try to find the fathers anymore there was the father they wouldn't try to find God anymore there was God sure that body was beaten torn but he wasn't destroyed because just in a few days you find him raised in glorified condition when was just a short period of time the Prophet said he said he went right off of Mount of Transfiguration straight to Calvary and someday I'll tell you what God showed me on that but it's there it's not going to be a great time that we're looking for remember we look out there we look back there instead of looking and seeing what's taking place but a run said to be a short period of time he said he left Mount of Transfiguration and went straight to Calvary a very short period this is my beloved son hear ye him God created the body according to perseverance 62 it was a different body yet it was a human body you know Solomon build him a house are you ready you know Solomon build him a house but Stephen said I'll be at the most out dwelleth not in outer then what a body that has prepared me God prepared himself a body in the form of the Lord Jesus which was the Christ meaning the Anointed One and now all that God was in Christ he was the fullness of the Godhead bodily that's what the scripture says all that God was he poured into Christ he was Emmanuel now what's the rest of that quote and all Christ he poured into the church right because now listen God build a body Moses saw that tried to put it in language couldn't sir David saw his message he could try to tell Solomon Solomon puts it over in the best he can do all they can do it was temples Enoch sees it all he can do is build it up here minute but God Himself said I'll just build my own body you remember what I said a minute ago because that's what the scripture said the scripture plainly says or in acts another heard he said if I wanted to outside build it himself and he did he build a body he just borrowed it wound to build a body but now listen there was only one body that was a tabernacle for Almighty God to come down and dwell in that body become United together with that soul and spirit until it was Almighty God dwelling on earth the body had to be redeemed because it was not sinful but because it was had a beginning it was made eternal now the body is the body of God right exists in Revelations you can see it in all of the prophet in his studies but my point is to do one time there was only one body that was not God's complete plan those his complete plan was to be a father a healer a savior a redeemer right that was his desires in the beginning not to just the fact of coming down and dwelling with man although that's wonderful and he wanted it and it happened but to come to mankind come to mankind and let mankind now listen let mankind build God a body that's what he wanted sure he built it himself cause it that was good but he wanted something for us to have to do with it he had to borrow a wound to get the first one right there was a connection to the human race with that body even though God created eggs sperm fine but there was a connection to the human race because there was the body of Mary she was used to bring forth that body that was God building himself a body that he could dwell on earth when who was it going to hell with I mean what was it going to Elvia it sorry for saying it and being human the way I am that wouldn't have put him very much farther than David and all of them with all the buildings that at least back neither had buildings and things that they could show to people with their God comes down and he wants the tabernacle he wants the place that he can dwell let's bypass the notion preach to them God then knows he's got to make a way he provided the first body provided all the things now he knows he's got a microwave for everything to come out right so he starts dealing with a human race you don't want him to build him another building that's why you get over there being Matthew that's what Peter didn't say it said Lord let us build the tabernacle one for Moses one Elijah and one for you let us build a he said just forget that that ain't what I want I want a body made and I'm making my own but that's not the plans completed I want you to have something to do with this one you had something to do with the other he was used and brought to earth and your mind was use your control of being and you made all of these buildings and you made all of these things that Tabernacles that looked and spoke he doesn't understand I said now I want you to move up a little closer how many quotes do you need for me to read where brother Branham says we are the dwelling place of Almighty God I'll just put it this away I'm not gonna ask you did you do it but if you read statue of a perfect man you got at least five or six statements literal word-for-word that the brighter Jesus Christ is the dwelling place of God God is now using me and you to bring into finality the whole finished story and he starts building on us brothers and sisters in her soul he brings that to eternal life because his soul was eternal he begins to work on our spirit realm to bring things into being and like I said if you read the statue of a perfect man you hear brother Branham say these virtues will bill God a tabernacle that he can live in that's what the virtues is far see I didn't stop with a part you'd think I'd stop the new bar it brings eternal life into the soul of mankind yes wonderful that's not to finish the story there's more of that try on being that needs to be brought into being needs to be redeemed you see it's not just for the fact that we're a soul that God could come down and live and that way we we could say well bless God I don't see it in my soul everything is wonderful in my soul you know all of that now there's other parts for this being those virtues have to come down and work from the inside out wordly into our spirit realm that others may see our faith our virtue our knowledge our temperance our patients our beings and all because that's the type of natural God wants may I quote brother branham a church with these did you read this one a church with these virtues in it is a church that will go in the rapture he said a people with these virtues in it will be the people that will go in the rapture well God was standing there and they beat him and they've done everything in the book to him but he said Father forgive them he turned around and gave up his life God took him into eternal life in body he didn't out take him to eternal life in his soul enough to take Jesus to eternal life in his spirit he had that but he took them to eternal life in his body making a complete unit fully redeemed does he church these virtues and things has got to come in to us as individuals and dwelling us to make us his divine nature and to build him a dwelling place to build him a tabernacle a body thou hast prepared me think about that as yourself God provided you a body God came down and gave your soul eternal life right by the new Birds come on what did he do that for he laid claim on the rest of us is that the seals that's in the seal book he laid claim on the rest of this property he purchased it lay claimed on it and one day it will follow the soul into eternal life a dwelling place for God to dwell this dwelling in you you mean wasn't come on do you have the new birth is the new birth of the life of very God himself is the very soul of God divided among the people he turn alive giving you well what do you think he's done that for he brings us then to a walk this is my beloved son who I'm pleased to dwell that on the River Jordan he said he's pleased to dwell in you and I at our new birth he's pleased to dwell but that's not the finish of the product with the Mount of Transfiguration brings the adoption the stature of a perfect man brings all of those things into being and then he says this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell hear ye him you realize what we're doing Church we are now not will be and mova yonder back yonder this we are now the body of God what other body does he have on earth he's not here on earth in a physical body according to the scriptures his body sitting on the throne but now he comes into you and me to build a body wonderful body he's going to build the brain from that inside man out through that spirit and bring it out into that body and bring faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and then love what a wonderful body that God is building you said well why have we been here so long because that is what he's been doing but we've been playing around dilly dallying and not been following him and walking into it and wondering if this doctrine is right and that doctrine is right trying to follow this and trying to wonder if this is ok should we follow this person should we follow that person that's all we're supposed to follow Almighty God I stood in this message without even you heard my story I didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost I come in this message so you get that right and what you're thinking with some brother stood one day and talking about it cuz one of the first doctrines that struck us you can't be saved after 63 Redemption was over 63 the lamb left the mercy seat I said according to my Bible and I wasn't quoting brother randomise quoting my Bible I said according to my Bible Redemption was over for the foundation of the world is that the scripture of the lamb slain before the foundation the world my Bible was telling me and I didn't have the Holy Ghost to do it I just had plain sense to think about it that you try to tell me I can't be saved I said forget it you didn't save me and you ain't gonna lose me Missy Church do you understand what I'm talking about you realize the point I'll drive it hard to say the statue of a perfect man will bring God's Tabernacle a body into being well you sound like you're trying to get the bike I'm trying to get the body redeemed that's exactly what I'm trying to do is get this body reading and as he works on me from my inside of the soul out through my spirit to bring these things into being and brings it out until the body will be completely redeemed a tabernacle for God to dwell in if you don't believe that I'm telling you I've got them laying here you're welcome to the notes why should we have to now try to prove that the Prophet said we are the body of Jesus Christ I know debt is a badness the tebab will talk to of a body and a body being a church where would you act we talk to some of these things in the Baptist Church where would you act same way you are now oh I don't know whether that's right or not yeah that sounds pretty good but I guess you could say in a way you remember that when brought around and said you can say in a way he said it's not to say in no way he said that ain't what it is the church instead of trying to find a place to go to church or to this that of the other and I'm not throwing no stones I'm just saying it why can't we settle down and realize we're the church that way you'd stop Church jumping right we realize we are the body of Christ and these virtues are to be added to your faith which brings your virtue your knowledge your temperature but own up to be your love that God will come up with because he's giving it from the inside out into her being God's plan and purpose was to end this all thing up with a future home am i right does he have a future home for us all to go to and when we go to that all born-again believers in the future home is going to be just as eternal as God is eternal because that was his plan and his purpose was to have a family to display all of these attributes father Saviour healer but worth the body of Christ we are the body of Christ God is preparing himself a body the statue of a perfect man back out into the individuals that are born-again believers come on brothers come on musicians a body thou has prepared me a dwelling plush God finishes up his dwelling place in a human body standing in eternity in what we call the future home the things you know eternity and Dyer will be his children his offspring right there will be his offspring there in that future home that is what he wanted and he will bring it to pies let's stand together think on these things or Tabernacle a body that has prepared me those are wonderful things back there you look at that and you you see they've they've got a thing over there in the in Israel that you can go and look and they've got a place made let's I don't know probably maybe twice the size of this building or something close to it and what it is it's laying out and drawing every one of those put the temple here put this here put this here put everything you know that was in back dark and they've got it laid out and you can just walk through and it tells you what they are and how all of those things what they represent it's wonderful it's beautiful but to know that I'm looking at what God come to redeem his plan and purpose is not fulfilled in a tender or a a concrete building no matter how beautiful it is if he built it of gold what would it be nothing like the body of Jesus Christ the born-again believers together together in one body in one frame what we got anybody have an aide hey old Spidey I've seen yes I sing out I love song [Music] Jesus who in moments like
