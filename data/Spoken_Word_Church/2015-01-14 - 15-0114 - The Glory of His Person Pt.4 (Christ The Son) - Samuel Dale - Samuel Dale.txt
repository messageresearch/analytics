that should be all of our desires right amen good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn to Revelations 1 and we'll go to Matthew 16 remember now the

we believe in God taking care of things amen just remember that any other announcements I generally forget but remember that remember the fellowship meeting there and if you want to go along with us let us know all right Revelations 1 Matthew 16 Heavenly Father we thank you because we know for a certain that thou art God and you change not then we can depend on you and we can just relax and not have to worry about anything let everything be right according to what you Lord want to be with each one of us so have your way come among us tonight in a mighty way and open the understanding of our hearts that we may see you our eyes of understanding is what we desire to be opened Lord Just Have Your Way bless those that are not here remember the sick father thank you for being with brother Lis there taking care of him bring everything completed and bring him back home Lord and we pray that you would just have your way with all of us tonight we love you we thank you in Jesus name amen all right Revelations 1 we'll begin about verse 10 I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou see us write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia unto Ephesus and and un Samia and un pergamus and Tara and unto Sardis and unto Philadelphia and unto lady OA and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one liken to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about the paps with a golden girdle all right trying to get some thoughts in mind to be able to follow on there end that scripture of going on and understanding you know and trying to look at it throughout the word and see the lineup okay go to Matthew 16 when Jesus came into the coast of cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples saying who do Man say that I the son of man am and they said some say thou art John the Baptist some Elias and other jeremias or one of the prophets he saith unto them but whom say ye that I am and Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now as I've said trying to get an understanding in the the U Book of Revelations then we will pick up the Sevenfold glory and be able to go on from that part but the main thing that I'm trying to get you and I both to see is that God reveals himself in many many forms uh you know he would appear here he would appear there he would show himself here show himself there and all but it's the same God all right then you can take the seven compound names of Jehovah you can follow that all the way through and see as the prophet said that all of those pertain to Jesus Christ all right then looking at one true and living God and seeing that uh you know and then when he ask here who do Man say I the son of man am he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God all right now as we've emphasized many times before he asked him who was a son of man well Peter evidently didn't catch that or he would have tried maybe to have answered accordingly but he answered according to what you read the rest of the verse it says that the father hath revealed these things unto thee and upon this I'll build my church all all right then the church is built on the revelation of the Christ the son of the Living God Amen right all right now you may not think of it as I do on what that means but remember the prophet said if you don't see Christ in every verse go back and read it again all right so then you go through and you follow Christ throughout the Bible so you can't follow Jesus Through the Bible right you can't see him physically for Etc in every verse but you can see the Christ amen all right and seeing that Christ then me to me then the greatest thing that it is the church has built upon the revelation of who Jesus Christ is all right he comes to John on patmas and the very first thing is what the Revelation that God give to Jesus to give to John to show the church what of who he is amen and then to show his future uh the you know the taking place and seeing the future and it would come out see to understand then the son of man right amen because none of your writers wrote of the son of man Paul and the greatest of all he was he never spoke of the son of man uh Peter and them yeah because they wrote you know because Matthew Mark Luke and John you say they wrote about the son of man right but never they never made any more uh what is the word for it commentaries or or uh anything later in relation to it and looked like Paul would have picked that up but yet he was concerned with the building of the church he was not concerned with a Rapture he says himself you know uh get it out of your mind that God is coming now that's what we used to think we we used to think that Paul was trying to get people to see you know that the Lord was coming the next day and brother Brown said he was trying to get it out of their mind because it have to be a falling away first it have to be these things and Paul knew that so there was no need of Paul dealing with the end time Revelation other than the prophecies that he made the the statements of change in a moment twink of an i etc those things he would make those but he would not deal with how that would come to pass amen all right and God knowing that he was going to send us a prophet to bring those things into being all right now then we we don't have to worry about what the symbols are and now this is going to be valuable later to talk about the the Sevenfold Glory so this is what I'm trying to get you to see that even though you see uh someone standing there uh it can still be in symbolics right because you know as we tried to emphasize last Wednesday night that uh you know that was not the body of the Lord Jesus Christ the human element the fleshly speaking standing in Revelations 1 but it was the body in being the body of Christ you know the Church all right now in being the body of Christ which is your church see you're still dealing with symbolics you're still be dealing with symbols of things or or something in relation you're not seeing it in total Purity uh orever how you would say the word for it uh because to me if you saw it like you needed to see it you would see Jesus now uh if if you don't like this statement then just cast it away but to me anything that will not bring Jesus Christ to the glorification that he's supposed to be brought I don't care if it's bragging about the people I don't care if it's talking about the people but if it does not bring Christ into the open and and showing him and showing who he is cuz who is the church come on right amen the church is Christ made manifest well then that's all I've ever tried to bring is to try to get us to see you know that Christ and that's what we're going to talk about tonight uh is Christ the son amen and we'll get back into the reason of using that in a minute as we go through but now we ended up and I went back and listened to the message because I I like to do that that and I know that I'm I'm I listen to that and I thought man have I got slow I recking 74 makes you slow but I'd rather be slow than fast and I'd rather repeat myself if that is you know part of old age signs and Paul had it and I don't know how old he was because for me he said for me to say the same thing is needful for you all right then but I was very very slow but very very I noticed it trying to make it and I do I'm trying to make it very uh to the point to where that you know what I'm saying all right now whether you believe it or not that's between you and God and I I can't reveal it anyway but I want to make it to where that it's clear enough to to where that you can say well this is what he believes all right now because that's always been my goal but forgive me for being that way and and you know and just being myself all right but we were talking about Sunday I mean Wednesday of how that we got to the point that we were talking about that no man has seen God right all right and see then by by doing that and and we've read it from 1 John 4:12 that no man has seen God at any time then we went to 1 Timothy 6:16 that whom no man can approach unto whom no man has seen nor can see now that's two two uh scriptures we used uh Moses remember when he said I like to see it he said you can't see my face you say well he later he seen the face well I I remember and I did in that I emphasized that you're not just talking about that kind of a look uh to me Moses wanted to see his see him and he says it's not time it's not the right place but said you'll never see me the way you want to see me that that's hard to try to emphasize to people but how else can you say it and stay with the scriptures that no man has seen God at any time all right you can say well he saw the back part there and he saw the front part later you're getting into what you think is good Revelations and the people get all tantalized with those things and say this look at what this is look at what that is but it doesn't uh answer any questions right to talize you with a piece of ice running up down your back won't answer questions right I I like for questions to be answered that way then I like what the prophet said when he says questions makes a strong church that's right you said well we can go here to this Baptist Church and boy they got 10,000 questions about all of the scriptures now that's not exactly what he's meaning to me all right you may think that I think he's meaning questions that are answered you're listening questions that are answered makes a strong Church sir it don't because we can go into the Bible and see where that questions gender stri so don't just think that it's questions no it's questions who that have been answered I had a lot of questions before I heard of this Prophet didn't you I still have a lot of questions after I heard about him and heard the message all right but they are gradually going away to give us understanding all right but we got down in to John 1 and18 where it says no man has seen God at any time but the only begotten son now I emphasize that in the message which is in the bosom of the father he had the clarity him all right so now we're dealing with the son and see when you're talking about um trying to understand to a trinitarian a son happened uh 2,000 years ago right that's the relation of a son that they talk about but we don't talk like that brother brandham took it all the way back as we will in a little bit he took it all the way back before the foundation of the world and speaks of the Son of God and he says now we don't believe in Eternal sunship so then there's something wrong with our understanding that we need to uh maybe think about a lot all right but are you with me now see Jesus said God is a Spirit John 4:24 or 5:24 or what it is there all right but yet he yet the scriptures would say nobody can see God well AR there's something about this part of saying that God is a spirit all right and we'll we'll get down into that in a minute so just hold your point of of that and I want to rephrase uh what I brought out Wednesday because I thought that was a good way for the prophet to give the definition and you know and we could have the understanding so if you will Brothers pull up number one and you know for me to repeat then I'm getting old so just mark it off he just old foty dudy uh but think about what he's saying and I ask you to listen to uh the message questions and answers on Genesis and I won't ask for a raise of hands it might embarrass you um but I hope you did uh you know and besides reading constantly of it and almost t almost printing out uh half the book I we still sat down and we listen to the message you know to try to hear the things because I wanted you to hear it and I wanted to hear it too all right but now look what he said now no man has seen the father at any time no man can see God in the bodily form now now you're going to have to Define things as you come down are you going to be in very uh limbo State all right no man can see God in the bodily form because God is not in body form God is a spirit all right no man has seen the father but the only begotten of the father have declared him all right in John now what do you think about when you see that or read the scripture or think about it that God is a spirit what what are your thoughts uh the prophet took it back before the foundational the world before there was any atoms molecules etc etc etc but he said that God existed now he explained that the word god is an object of worship all right so then uh you know he didn't wasn't God until he created angels and they worshiped and that made him God but that didn't make him God like making him God that made him manifest as God because he would have been God to begin with or else you've missed it you'd say no God is an object of worship well then before he ever made anything that was one of his attributes right okay remember that in the prophet's message that's one of his attributes is to be God was to be father was to be son was to be human was to be this that that was already in him so then he already had those attributes he was just not displaying Angels worshiped him that was a display and that brought him into being all right but now watch now we take the part of God being a spirit and it's very easily to be like that there's no form there's no uh you know nothing it's just Spirit right well now I hope tonight we can deal with that a little bit by way of the Prophet to to take a lot of that that out of your mind as to thinking about just a right I will read in a minute where the Prophet said it he said if he's just like the wind then you do not have to pray for the baptism of the Holy Ghost it would be in you that's the amoia out in right so you see where I'm going but see we we we get our mind locked in and our thoughts are on God is a spirit but watch what he goes on to say now notice there's nothing there just space there's no light there's no dark there's nothing it's just seems nothing but in there is a great supernatural being okay Jehovah God who covered all space in all places at all times he was from Everlasting to ever lasting he's the beginning of the creation Now watch when we get over into it far enough that brother R says God was his first creation see he then needs the beginning of the creation of God all right that's God can't see nothing can't hear nothing not a move of an Adam in the a not nothing no hour no nothing but yet God was there that was God now let's watch for a few minutes and no man has seen God that's the father see all right now are you listening we want to make him as a spirit as to be uh no form no doings but yet he says here that he's a being right amen now I I've always been and I'm sorry to be blunt but at least you understand me you mean we are beings you mean we have a form you mean we are tangibles uh could be felt you know Etc but yet God is just a spirit that that would make us more real than he is right I don't go that way I'm sorry because I believe that if I'm going to believe in God as a Creator to bring into being I'm going to believe that he's real now if I ask you a question without laying down the case I have before you and I would ask you the question and I would say brother collie do you believe the devil's real and you'd say yes and as I said if I hadn't laid your mind something that you know that I'm pulling you into a point of thinking you would really say the devil is real maybe not in the real points of this you know materialistic uh you know the the 16 elements or the metals or anything but I I get Plum tickled at people's thinking that there is no God and we think about well who created all of this you know and I know I'm just plain carnal but that's the way I think if the devil is God he's real because he created where we are so that would make him greater than what we are even the Devil Himself I know I know my mind's all slipped and gone and it's all right nursing home's waiting on me teren is getting plans send me and all of that that's hard I'm got to get away from that a just a fun point to drive a a nail down even if I believed in in Buddha Hindu Muslim uh allas um any of the other names for your gods that people claim to be uh I would still believe they were real or why would I believe in them I believe there has to be some form of Supernatural being that brought us into existence don't you all right then if that supernatural being brought us into existence then he's greater than we are because he brought us we didn't bring him right right he brought into the into existence the things that we speak of that are tangibles you know solids all right so then you know I just laugh at people when they say there is no God or something like that cuz I I say Well they're caught in that trap but now listen God is not like the wind that was where we ended up uh kind of you know being but let me get these two in the middle here to where that we before we get to that point go ahead with number two cuz I like this and I like these two places cu in case anybody won't say well I believe in everything after the seals well we give you one after the seal one for the seal so you know we we just do that but look what he says on questions and answers on Hebrews uh theal 2 57 102 another body and I don't want to dwell on this very much I'm trying to get down okay the body God is the spirit how many understand that say Amen God is a spirit Jesus is a man and Jesus was God made flesh Jesus was we could never see God see he's a spirit you can't see Spirit no man has seen God at any time no man couldn't see God all right are you reading what he's saying then let me say this you've never seen me right you never seen me in all your life and you never will see me you know what he's explaining God talking about himself you'll never see me that's right you see this body that declares this person that's in here now this body doesn't have eternal life but the spirit has eternal life this body will go back but it'll come forth again and his likeness like a grain of wheat all right look at the next one which is Shalom 64 when he says but really frankly we have never seen each other right did you know that we have never seen one another you hear something speaking out of a body here that impersonates whatever is on the inside I love that you know the reason I love that I'm sure I had read those things and it was dwelling in on my mind but you know what 90% of the people are preachers and forgive me for numbers most preachers preach to bodies right sure hair dress clothes shoes you know right but you know the Lord showed me something back many many years ago I've made this statement when I say it most of you will remember it real well I said I'm not speaking to your body I'm talking to the one inside of there brother random was not trying to uh contact bodily forms of people you automatically do that that's a human element but he was trying to get down on the inside of that inside to where that inside could make up its mind what it wants to be and I thought when I read these I thought I really love those that's because that's the way I've always been I I what good does it do to be the body you know that's what people say oh we went to church and the preacher he just preached a whole sermon on me and I just feel so good well why didn't you repent and get straightened up where the preacher could have preached something oh yeah he just beat my toes to Pieces well clean up your toes right you want to go back the next service and let him beat on you again and you go home feeling good you repent you cry you ask the Lord to forgive you and you go home feeling Lord I just feel so good he just he just told me like it was tonight well you don't need to be told like it was again I mean one time's good enough may I quote the prophet he said what is it about a woman you can't get her put on a pair of pants and she's got the Holy Ghost and he said you don't have to tell the bride but one time am I quoting it maybe paraphrasing it a little but am I right that what he said but you see church then maybe we'll to get down to thinking about what sometimes people are doing when we get so upset at him he's talking about me well you know what honey if you ain't guilty I can't talk about you but if you are guilty is it me that's doing the talking or is there something inside of here trying to talk to the something that's inside of you re like this okay I'll get off of it in a minute you hear something speaking out of a body here that impersonates whatever is on the inside see then when we talk to each other we're really not talking to the body it's the spirit inside but the body is the thing that identifies the spirit that's on the inside and therefore when we speak to each other we are quickly can understand right away whether we're Christians or not caus ours a fellowship in the spirit that we talk from is that true do you love to talk to people that are not in the word more than you do people that are in the word then you're out of the word I'll continue quickly you understand right away whether you're a Christian or not because there's a fellowship in the spirit that talk from you see that it vibrates to one another that whether we are Christians or not therefore we have never seen each other Jesus no man has seen God at any time but the only begotten of the father has declared him in other words God was identified that's right the person of God was identified in the body the Lord Jesus Christ so he was the expressed image of God Amen or God expressing himself through an image right all right see through an image man God expressed himself to us and he was God not a third person or second person but he was the person he was God himself identifying himself so that we could see him all he goes straight to 1 Timothy 3:16 without controversy that's argument great is the mystery of of godliness for God was manifested are made known in the flesh see the son declares him brings him out into the open isn't that wonderful God we could uh never understand God as he moved through a pillar of fire and so forth as he did but we understood him when he became one of us see when he became one of us we could touch him we could handle him we could do you know the Bible says you've handled God all right but not you didn't handle God because God is a spirit but what did you handle you handled the form that he changed himself into to live in that form now we'll get more on that next Wednesday of of some things on God but I just wanted to get those things see you've never seen God at any time why because he's Spirit God but does that mean he's not a person just when you say he's a spirit does that mean he's not a person the prophet who just read that he said he's not the first second one he's not the first person he's the person I love that statement the person all right now what about God how real is your God I'm not talking about condescending we we are not down we will get to that the Lord willing further on about the God the baby the man the the things and but we're back before the foundation of the world by way of the Prophet message talking about this great Eternal one who covered all space Time and Eternity and how that he is real amen is your god real that's a simple question see I ask most people if you ask and I'm not to no stones but you ask people that are not trained in the message part of what we've heard you go over here and you ask them you said well the Bible says God is a spirit said what do you think about that well he's just a spirit it was just back there when there was wasn't nothing and he was nothing but just the spirit you know well that would make us greater than him and we we can't do it all right look what your Prophet had to say go to Number Four Brothers which is questions and answers on Genesis and you heard him make this statement and then he asked the question now let us who Father and Son now brother Brandon wasn't a trinitarian right but he had no problem saying father and son could say let us right now theologians got trouble there or theological mind had because there's two people involved father son but see we know that the son is the father made manifest in another form so we don't have problems well what about this communicating well I remember one day when a man was standing on on the River Jordan and here came a dove down and here came a voice and that looks like three people but we can't go that way and remain in the truth of one true and living God see then we just look at the acts of a play right but now watch the point now listen very carefully for a few moments let us who Father and Son make man in our own image now if a man was made something like that little sacred light Yonder going to way on back right or something like it could not be seen which is a spiritual being he manifested or unfolded himself down a little more to make a trip inity of himself by father Son and Holy Spirit but how many gods do you have even if you're going back to the the old thought of God as a spirit you would still hold it at least to one you wouldn't have a whole bunch so what are you thinking well brother brandom he has no problem using the word Trinity or triun he has no problem because he's talking of what like a trinity of himself but Father Son and Holy Ghost and here was God unfolded himself now down into let us make man which was his son and all sprang from him him man in our own image he was a supernatural being amen so now remember your scriptures as we go along let us make man in our own image so whatever image this is is the same image he was a spiritual being and we Are Spiritual being or were created that in the beginning right he was a spirit your spirit there no problem but he was a being and we're a being I'm talking about Adam the beginning all right let him have dominion over the cattle of the field and so and the M lad not in natural flesh that was later right right that's right y later he was Genesis is 2 and 7 brother brandom what are these this doing he said Genesis 1 questions and answers you heard it if you listen to the tape he said God is a spirit and said the man was made as a spiritual being because God's image was spiritual being amen now all right hold your thought then if God is a spirit that's nonconformity to anything and has no form whatsoever has nothing that he is but just like the wind blowing about then he created a man just exactly like that our language has messed up somewhere that's right because language says let us make man in our own image right so whatever he was this man that he made was just like him you follow me so that order to get a lot of that out of your idea about this the spirit part all right then in Genesis 2:7 he made a natural man and he put to Genesis 1 126 and 27 into 27 and brought him on Earth to do but yet he was already controlling the animals and leading and doing in that spiritual being that he was okay so think about it let's read this one number five I love it that we just read no man can see God in the bodily form because God is not in body form God is a spirit but now he doesn't say that that person does not have a form that's our problem he's talking about a bodily form what do you think of in bodily form I think of 16 elements don't you I think of this old stuff God's not in a bodily form but now when he created man in his own image what image was God before he created a man well I don't know I wouldn't back there and I don't figure I need to know well whoe I'm glad you're so super religious because these things are very valuable to me because the only way you'll ever see who you are is to see who God is first sister came to me there last Wednesday and said nobody else might not called it but said I seen for one time myself in the Bible Hallelujah I said praise the Lord amen that's all I'm trying to do to get you to see yourself in the Bible and when you do you can see the Christ and who he is and you can see Moses and who that was and David and who that was and Paul and who that was and brother brandom and who he was and you see yourself in the Bible you say but but brother Dale is just it's just a spiritual what okay let's go a little further then look at the next one which is number six it wasn't so from the beginning uh E10 now God is omnipotent omnipresent by being omniscient makes him om the present now you'll really catch shown what he means in a minute by that statement we just take it from there he being omniscient makes him omnipresent and he knows all things but God God could not be just like the a is because God has a Dwelling Place God is not a myth God is a being God Jesus he God pronoun he he is a being therefore he's omniscient omnipresent omnipotent and infinite right he's not like the air right floating around he's a being all right look at the next one Fellowship 1960 e19 raise it on up toward and I said God is a being now watch he's talking to somebody else you know now God's just not like your like the hour if he would you would never have to seek the Holy Ghost it would be in you cuse he'd fill all space and things God's omnipresent sure by being omniscient he's omnipresent in the fact that he's omniscient he knows where he needs to be right knowing all things but God has a dwelling place because he's a being exactly right and God dwells with Fellowship under the shed blood of his son and that alone amen not up on our denomination sometime CU you know what our denomination got him oh he's just a floating around he's just a spirit he just he has no form he has no uh you know what about it what are you thinking about I didn't give them this one this is taken from the message of God's provided way preached in 1953 and God put man first first in his own image which was in in an image of God and God is a supernatural being he was a supernatural man and then he put him in five sentes see Adam created he was a supernatural man and then he was put in five senses none of those the senses decare anything but what is he he's a supernatural being all right going with who is this Mel chdc number 8 paragraph 48 and 49 preached in 1965 to20 221 now he if he isn't infinite isn't God God has to be infinite we're finite he's infinite and he was omnipresent omniscient and omnipotent if he isn't then he can't be God knows all things all places because of his omnipresent omniscient makes him an omnipresent he is a being he's not like the wind well brother Dale them others was written a 50 60 and he changed after the seals broke well that's 65 I think is after I believe who is this mzc is 65 he's a being he DS in a house but being omniscient knowing all things makes him an omnipresent because he knows everything that's going on how do you believe that can you put your life and your Stakes upon that to believe it that he's omniscient which means he knows all things and that makes him on the present and he's not not omnipresent in the words we use omnipresent right because our words of omnipresent if you remember through would just make him like the wind just being anywhere and everywhere he's not that way as I've always said if there's nobody on the moon right now he don't have to be on the moon that's right but when anybody goes up there he always goes with them why because he knows all things things right right but he's not like the wind he's a person the person far greater than you and I well if you think you're something then you ought to know that I'm trying to tell you God is greater than the something you think you are but what do you think about God is a spirit he's a spiritual being he made Man In His Image did he make man just a spirit or a spiritual being was the first man just a spirit form this you we talk about the angel being Spirits Etc but you know they do have forms now if we are in His image and listen hey I know the message a little bit okay I got a little bit of understanding that the first man was made in the image of God the spirit man second man was made in the image of animal right you know hand like a chimpanzee etc etc but you know when we get over on that other side and all of this is gone are we going to see a glob sitting somewhere and realize it's the father well we don't have no form or is it just that we can just feel the wind blowing through the heavens and we think well that's him well I think the prophet done a good job of defining that if he's just everywhere then you wouldn't have to pray for the Holy Ghost right he'd be inside you CU he'd be everywhere well you know where that' make him if he's in you he'd be an a Hitler he'd be in judas's character he'd be in the meanest person you could think of in in your life right right now and now I hope we don't believe that at least to get away from that we might make him a round bouncing ball as a glob but we certainly don't want this to put it to work that it would just be in everything that's right and see that would make the devil then to be in that form too because he'd be a spirit do you understand what I'm getting at I believe God is real I believe that he's not just like the wind he's a being he's a supernatural being but that supernatural being can be anywhere in the world he desires to be that's right right now but being as he is as a being he limits himself forgive me for the words he limits himself to the point of being in one place y you know or many places if he desires to be and that's why I like the scripture where it says you know that and talks about how that the prophet expressing it that see Jesus could only be in one place but now he's got a many membered body that can be around the world so then the more are many there you know more and things in the scriptures doesn't go wrong it's true all but what do you think about God my desire has always been one thing and that's to learn more about him am I've always had that desire I had it when I was in the Baptist Church I wanted somebody to tell me about him but what they would tell me didn't bit what I had an understanding of so one day I had to walk out of there and move on because I I knew that there the people I was talking to didn't have the same thing in them that I had in me even in the point that I wasn't even claiming to be born again at that time see because even a person's not born again got a little common sense you you might not be able to to know God in the correct way but at least you can know there's a God you know I mean you can know there's something real about all of this instead of thinking like an idiot that we was a poliwog flipped over on one side and grow an arm and the leg and flipped over the other way grow another night while we stood up and begin to walk well where did the pow come from right right but then we'll come into the uh religious realm of mankind and in our religious realm of mankind we read the word of God and and not having say the inside teacher that we will try to put our own thoughts upon that scriptures and come out with some concept or thought and that's where your trinities come from your no your hell being Eternal you're all kind of things that comes out of people in their minds thinking without it being the Holy Ghost to teach I I want the inside teacher don't you right and see that with that inside teacher then I don't I wouldn't have to worry about anything all right but do you understand what I'm getting at right I'm not talking about now listen we have to use phrases and words and I'm not talking about where that God begins to condescend down to where we can understand him or help us to I'm talking about what was he before the world before anything before any concept thoughts or ideas I Think Jesus would have a pretty good understanding of the scriptures with you when he said you know that uh God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in what spirit and in lies that's told by everybody not exactly what it says right spirit and in truth I was thinking about it today and I still didn't bring it I forgot it do you realize that nobody can see God unless they see him in you right CU remember God is is a spirit amen but if they can see what's come in your life and seeing it affect you right and seeing you live in that realm of you know to them as a place that they say we can never attain un to where you are you know we we value you we honor you we we do but we can't live like that because we are in this realm here for you sisters as the prophet would say now for you to go down the road walking with your high drag in the ground is the what's the lady that's the singer crystal gaale is she an image of a Christian when her High I remember seeing it one time it was like a couple of feet you know on the ground well is that the image of a Christian when you turn it around and her face is painted and makeup all over it and and her clothes are ungodly and no but what about you sisters just going about your daily Duty and you're going to Walmart you're going to where you work or whatever you do and you just dress correctly and you have your hair fixed and and all of the things and you know you're a witness to them about Christianity why because you got the rest of the makeup right you know was it not to prophet's words like this he said live me a sermon instead of preaching me one y right man you see somebody that can preach like a LK but live like the devil i' I get that one irks me I'm sorry I'm human I ain't blaming that on 74 it irked me when I was 25 it irks me to see the people of this message that had rather hear a man that's been married for 9 times and he's he's a jail bird and he can sing and and he can do all the things and they'd rather hear him than someone who has lived a decent life and at least tried to be right and honest and stay with the word now you know what I'm saying is true you just don't want to admit it that's right right you don't want to admit it but it's true right that don't change the point but for to see I thought we were to I never knew that all of this great understanding of the message was to do away with the fruits of the spirit I thought it was to bring it into manifestation I thought the fruits of the spirit was instead of just saying Faith virtue knowledge I thought you could say love joy peace goodness I thought that was the fruits of the spirit and I thought that was what God wants to see in each and every one of us right right amen and see then if people can see Christ in you they want to be like that but I've always told you and I know it hurts feelings so get ready rub it good some of the people of this message I wouldn't want to be their children some of the preachers in this message I wouldn't want to be their children if I die and go to hell I'd like to stay at least sensible enough to try to live a decent life before my kids that they could actually be able to in a little way see Christ amen amen yes sir because I've always believed that whatever God was back there he still is that's right am sir am but he's not like the wind he's a being right he dwells in a house I thought that we understood that Jesus was up there right now building us a house called a future home but I didn't think he was up there doing it I thought he was down here in you and I sending up boards that we say for whatever the Mansion is well what would our mansion look like right but what about God see God had to move from that position that he was in and remember the position I'm talking about is not just like the wind floating around he was in another dimensional form or whatever you want to call it Place house living dwelling moon stars Mars whatever you want to call it God lived before any of the this ever come into being amen that's right and you know that he had thoughts about Redemption etc etc I won't get to it tonight but next Wednesday we'll get to it to find out when them thoughts started coming into display he had those thoughts as Spirit God but when he condescended down into another form brother BR said he stands there and in his mind he's thinking about how to do this that's not the spirit God before the foundation of the world that's the logos one to create these are not new things let me just give you just a little bit where I lay a foundation for the next message what about a prophet that could talk like this seventh grade education man but yet he could speak of these things pull up number nine preparation preached in 53 1111 paragraph 23 let's take a minute little mental trip tonight you and I and let's go back before there there was a star in the heaven for there even wasn't anything how a man could go back I love I love that statement where he talks about God and he said in the beginning before for the Eternal we can't talk about eternity he's talking about in the beginning before eternity and then we want to try to make God as just some Spirit form oh for there was a star and everything sitting way back in eternity that was God and then going out of God or God unfold holding himself what comes the logos which was the son of God are the word of God right in the beginning was a word and word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the logos we'll get to it later I got it laying on the desk may have it here I doubt it but have you ever noticed in the message the unveiling of God brother B said in the beginning was Elohim Elohim was with God and Elohim was God he had no problem talking that way right he had no problem speaking of a Son of God but he never did talk about God the son all right and watch we're seeing God unfold himself then he said in Genesis let us make man in our own image what kind of a man was he he had to be a spirit man and they put him in the senses to contact Earthly home he gave him a foot like a bear and hand like a monkey but he was a spirit man cuz God was Spirit but he said he begins to unfold now what was the scripture that we said to remember no man has seen God at any time one John 1:18 no man has seen God at any time but the only begotten son that's the scripture we read now come on the only begotten son ha declared him or as as the prophet would say brought him out into the open the Son of God which was the word of God all right go on to the next try to cut off in just a minute the message called life let's close our eyes to our imagination for a few moments and go way back into the before there was anything the great Fountain of all eternity couldn't you just hear a theologian trying to explain that you real what this man was doing a theologian say where did he get that he got that the way Moses got that and wrote that all right how did Moses get all about Genesis and what happened in the garden and wrote the first five books wrote of his own death for he died right now come on get read your Bible huh way back no what Fountain of Eternity was that Spirit of love joy that Spirit of honesty that Spirit of tress what was back before the world all of that in this Perfection then out of the existence of the father went the logos which was the son which was the theophany which was the body of the great Jehovah God went forth in a Celestial body right right that's the logos the word spoke out of them great Fountains of life and went forth and there was the theophany which was God made in word right we we'll go back over this next Wednesday but what I want you to uh get is just a little point and then we'll quit mind can only comprehend what the seat can endure all right let me get the license trying to find there there it is look what he says on questions and answers on Genesis you should have heard him say this paragraph 21 which would be number 13 brother back up cuz you're on 14 I want to be on 13 first because you're on it Hebrews run it up now where we can see it he talking about the leading the Holy Spirit he was in other words Adam was the first man in the lower creation of God now theologians get ready for your teeth to fall in the floor because how are you going to comprehend what this man with his sixth or seventh grade education is fixing to say the first creation was God himself you know the Bible tells you where God come from do you know that he come from teeman that's right and look up Tean you'll find out it means right hand so you need to go right back around to your circle and it all connects but look the first creation was God himself then out of God came the Loos which was the son of God then out of the Loos which was the word in the beginning was word and word with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwell among out of the L guys came forth the man bringing it down to Genesis I thought that we understood that gen that Revelations 3:14 begins talking about the message to this age and it says the beginning of the creation of God amen we want to lay that all Upon Jesus and that's wonderful because we we'll do that we have to bring it forth because he coming into being where he says a body thou has prepared me but where did the Sun come into being the prophet can talk about it in simple terminologies but the sun was the first form of God that moved out to where we could comprehend amen Our God condescended in the form to be the word god being the son but we don't believe in Eternal sunship so just get that part out of the way but we believe in Eternal godship right do you need that quote that's what your Prophet said don't believe in Eternal sunship he said but I believe in Eternal godship amen I believe that a Son of God can be Eternal amen I hope I'm looking at a bunch of them right that have eternal life and you know what we never will be nothing but Sons and Daughters of God so we better kind of get used to that point but God being the first Creation in other words simple terminologies now what's he saying God just simply moving from the existence of where he was over into another existence is that the way we will get back to it next week the word that the prophet was explaining he says not a part of God going off like a lamb or an arm or something he said but a part just going out and that's the Son of God but brother d i not was Son of God 2,000 years ago that's how far we are missing it evand Scofield in his footnotes comprehends the point of talking about Son of God as the word the theophany why because I believed the Bible says that all things were created by Him and without him which was a son right Hallelujah nothing wouldn't created outside of Him Father didn't create a thing but a body for the son to step into and he had to come 4,000 years ahead of time to be the Son of God to where he could speak the word into existence to bring a body I know that to most people is like I said a the his mind goes Haywire how could God have a beginning he's not talking about a beginning like we talk about he's not talking about a creation like we talk about it he's talking about a coming into existence to where you can see it right there was a day my wife and I could not see our children but according to genetic makeup they were were th present in me true that's right what do you think about it what about your God but brother Dale you read a statement a while ago that where brother Brandon said is not in a bodily form I agree wholeheartedly not in a 16 element form but let's read this last one and we'll quit which is taken from the message questions and answers on Hebrews part two 5712 paragraph 385 will be number 14 all right God went out logos so Jesus had a beginning God had no beginning see but the son was not Eternal sunship but the son that was with the father in the beginning was the logos that went out of God right it was the theophany of God that went out y well theophanies and Spirits are just floating around the human form that didn't have eyes like you see oh that'd be a good one to stop wouldn't it a better eye it didn't have ears like you hear but a far more hearing see it was a theophany that all this rainbow conders into theophany Moses saw it when it passed through the rock like that he saw the back part said it looked like a man I thought brother brandham when he went beyond the curtain of time could feel those people that he said was in theophany I thought he could feel him right but you see we want to make everything so supernaturally spiritual until we just put oursel totally out of the way and you know but I've been at this 40 years so I ain't worried about it we got 40 more be fine probably some of us won't be here but that's fine with me what's my point my point is that when I saw what this Prophet started talking about I laid down all of my thinking about what I used to think about God is a spirit and he's juster this there he goes no he ain't going nothing and he's over here now don't tell me we didn't think about them things don't tell me you didn't have questions back then you see the God I serve is real so let's come on Brothers he was real before he ever got here where we're at and all we're doing is just showing the reality of a living God and what he really is to speak of him as being tangible yeah but brother Dale you just try to make God too tangible well now if he could create this wood it's pretty hard he got to be greater than that but we just don't see him like that but he condescended so you and I could understand let's stand Christ the son of the Living God we'll try to bring it more Wednesday to get back on it but see when he says Christ the son of the Living God and when he say Jesus Christ created all things we know the Flesh of Jesus never created it was the Christ the Christ created all things then Peter had a great Revelation that the church is built upon the church is not built upon Concepts or ideas of imaginations of Spiritual Beings or this doing this this know you know we don't know nothing about it the Bible is full of the truth of God am men saw God but they never saw God they saw the form he used for the day right he would appear in a form to mankind but yet mzd spoke of him in Hebrews 7 and it calls him almighty God right but you know what it called him there too verse forly it called him a man and you know Abraham fed a calf to a man amen he didn't feed a calf to a spirit it floating around or something right he fed it to a man that man was almighty God go ahead brother what we got 596 feel the P think on these things at night iay in in bed and I begin to cry anybody have a and fails to know I maybe the reason we don't see God is because we don't believe God is real within it must be God if I was only expecting to see a spirit I would be trying to figure out which way the wind are blow I feel the pool just remember if God is like people thinks then you don't have to pray for the Holy Ghost it's in you because it's the wind but he's not like the wind give my heart he's real he speaks to me and I agree Lord please come and take control I feel the poor I went to hear the word say that well we're sending him for that purpose amen father you make it manifest in Jesus name anybody else they explain t deep within it must be in my soul for I feel the pool we run out of prayer CL so I feel the PO if the brothers will if you'll come up I let's pray over this and then we'll leave it here on the pull pit know believe that whatever is needed take it you believe let's lay our hands and believe it Lord Jesus we know these prayer claws are in your word and that's what we do we send them out your name Lord we just cut these up and we Lord we believe that they're taken from the body because it's not just a piece of material that way but yet it's a clo and we just lay our hands on it believe it that you'll take care of everything she'll make it manifest what everybody's asking for and we as brothers in Christ and sisters are praying also Lord believing that when this goes out it these prayer claws that they will accomplish what is asked for because we believe you we lay our hands are believe in it by your stripes so people are healed salvation Deliverance whatever is needed is her and your word amen do you believe it know his leave that there you oh he speaks to me and I age I won't wait to where this Sunday before we cut it up control I feel the pool do you I feel the pool don't you right I feel God is wanting you and I to move closer and get away from all of the things and ideas and thoughts that's right we're getting older we're worrying out that's all right then he said last night said we getting old ain't we well I'm not worried about it don't care how much longer we got or how much shorter we got that has nothing to do with it it's resting in him and believing it right doctor tell you you got this that of the other okay hey Doc that's what you getting paid for but God is my healer that's right he's the one who takes care of me so I ain't going to be worried about it you go to the doctors I'd like to I'd like if you'd sat down and listen for about 4 hours I'd like to explain healing in doctors I may do that one day because that's been on my mind for quite a while you mean God now we know there's quacks but they quack preachers so don't worry about that part you know but real doctors are trying to help you right they do the best they can well you know when your head's are hurting a good old aspirin that was made by somebody is real good to take away that pain you don't have to keep on hurting the prophet said that little nitroglycerin peel he said it's nothing but just for that little valve in there that kind of opens it up and makes it work he said we God knew we would need that and he gave it to us yeah but you put too much confidence in do hey if you went with me sometimes and way I talk to doct you would you probably wouldn't want to doctor me cuz I don't mind telling them doc I'll do what you're saying but God is the Healer he's the one who takes care of things so you do the best you can do that's you know you help me and you know but we're going to sit up front and say God Is A Healer ain't nothing wrong with taking medicine but ain't nothing wrong with not taking it that's where you got to meet a middle of the road for your own self be what you think all right father we just commit the service to you tonight Lord in your loving grace we ask you to be with each and every one of us and guide us on the way home take care of everybody give a safe journey be with each and everyone be with all of the sick Lord that's among us remember Brother Gary there Lord I forgot to tell the people tonight so I'll just tell them while I'm talking to you about it that he said that he was going to try his best to come this coming Sunday Hallelujah that he would just want to make sure that he didn't come in on some sicknesses and things so then if somebody is sick among us really bad just stay away from Brother Gary and just walk away from him and be off somewhere else and all Lord and just help us all to be that way and not to be so stubborn in their own selves have to do everything we love you and we thank you we commit everything into your hands in Jesus name amen amen you're dismissed as I travel through this pilm land there is a friend who walks with me leads me safely through the sinking sand it is a Christ of calvary this would be my prayer dear Lord each day that I may do the best I can for I need thy light to guide me day and night blessed Jesus hold my hand
