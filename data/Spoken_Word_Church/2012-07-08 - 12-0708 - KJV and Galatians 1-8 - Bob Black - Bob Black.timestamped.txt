[0:00] what's last week's topic on pause for a
[0:02] little bit and it kind of changed
[0:04] Direction
[0:06] um I started I've been reading this this
[0:09] wonderful little book in all thy word
[0:11] and it's like it's a great big huge book
[0:13] but if you okay you can kind of open it
[0:15] up anywhere and the whole topic is the
[0:18] difference between the King James
[0:19] version and and some of the other Bibles
[0:24] so I wanted to talk about the King James
[0:27] version and Galatians 1 8. and uh so
[0:31] turn it uh foreign Galatians chapter one
[0:35] you know I want to kind of go through
[0:38] um what brother Brown said about
[0:39] different Bible versions
[0:41] and um
[0:44] how to know how to how to uh Galatians
[0:52] but um I'm gonna I don't turn we're all
[0:56] familiar with the scripture in
[0:57] Revelation revelation 22 18 19 when it
[0:59] says for I testifying to every man that
[1:02] hears the words of the prophecy of this
[1:04] book
[1:05] If any man shall add under these things
[1:08] God shall add unto him the plagues that
[1:11] are written in this book
[1:12] and if any match will take away from the
[1:14] words of the book of this prophecy God
[1:15] shall take away his part out of the book
[1:17] of life and out of the holy city and
[1:19] from the things which are written in
[1:20] this book
[1:22] and I've heard people say before that
[1:23] that only applies to the Book of
[1:26] Revelation
[1:27] in other words you can change the other
[1:30] books as long as you don't change
[1:32] Revelation oh it just doesn't make any
[1:35] sense oh
[1:38] this is a
[1:40] I'm reading from revelation 22 but I
[1:43] wanted you to turn into Galatians 1 so
[1:45] I'm going there to say
[1:47] um so what
[1:49] this is really talking about is that the
[1:52] standard that was said at the original
[1:53] in the original has to be the same
[1:55] standard that we're hooking on to the
[1:58] the Pentecostal standard is the same
[2:00] standard we're held to what they're but
[2:02] the original Revelation was that our
[2:04] Revelation that's the match that
[2:06] in the Ephesian Church age brother and
[2:08] said If any man who's reading this
[2:10] scripture If any man shall take away
[2:12] from the words of the book of his
[2:13] prophecy God should take away his part
[2:14] out of the book of life he said thus
[2:16] what the church was at Pentecost is the
[2:18] standard that is the pattern there is no
[2:20] other pattern no matter what the
[2:22] scholars say God has not changed that
[2:24] pattern
[2:26] what God did at Pentecost he has to keep
[2:28] on doing until the church age is closed
[2:30] so to see if we're
[2:34] we got to match ourselves with the
[2:36] original pattern and that's also what um
[2:40] you can kind of compare the uh the King
[2:43] James version and go back through all of
[2:45] the previous versions which is what the
[2:46] translators did to to brother Venom
[2:50] talked about how God protects his word
[2:52] he makes sure that his his word says
[2:55] what it's supposed to say
[2:57] and um so we're going to look at the
[3:01] next 30 minutes that some of the things
[3:02] that by Revelation brother random saw
[3:05] that were not quite right in the King
[3:06] James version and we'll compare it with
[3:09] some of the other verses that are out
[3:10] today
[3:11] um
[3:12] so let's see so Paul's doctoring as a
[3:16] standard now let's read Galatians
[3:18] chapter one and Galatians 1 8 is very
[3:21] familiar to us all
[3:23] but let's kind of set the the stage for
[3:26] Galatians 1. so this letter was written
[3:29] to the churches not one particular
[3:31] church but the churches in galatia
[3:34] to set them straight on some what what
[3:37] had happened was some some different
[3:39] preachers were coming through and saying
[3:42] um just to for example my message is
[3:47] right because I knew Peter or John or I
[3:51] uh say I fished with the prophet or
[3:55] um
[3:56] or anything other than what Paul is
[3:59] fixing to say and this kind of applies
[4:01] to us too what what is our Holy Ghost
[4:04] experience based on is it based on the
[4:06] fact that we go to a certain church or
[4:10] that we um sat under like maybe maybe a
[4:14] particular Minister might say that what
[4:16] I preach is correct because I have I sat
[4:19] under brother so and so for many years
[4:22] but listen to what Paul says
[4:25] Paul an apostle not a man neither by man
[4:30] but by Jesus Christ and God the Father
[4:33] who raised him from the dead
[4:35] and all the brother in which are with me
[4:37] unto the churches of galatia
[4:39] Grace be to you and peace from God the
[4:42] father and from our Lord Jesus Christ
[4:43] who gave himself for our sins that he
[4:46] might Deliver Us from this present evil
[4:48] world according to the will of God and
[4:50] our father
[4:52] to whom be glory forever and ever amen
[4:55] I'm Marvel that you are so soon removed
[4:58] from him that called you into the grace
[5:00] of Christ enter another gospel
[5:02] which is not another but there be some
[5:04] that trouble you and would pervert the
[5:07] gospel of Christ
[5:08] but though we are an angel from heaven
[5:11] preach any other gospel unto you then
[5:13] that which we have preached unto you let
[5:16] him be accursed as we said before so say
[5:19] I now again if any man preach any other
[5:21] gospel unto you than that ye have
[5:23] received let him be a curse
[5:26] so Paul's laying it down but if anybody
[5:29] preaches anything else other than what I
[5:30] preached and and in a second he's going
[5:33] to show you why
[5:34] that when we get to verse 12 for Dua
[5:37] verse 10 for do I now persuade men or
[5:39] God or do I seek to please man
[5:42] for if I yet please men I should not be
[5:45] the servant of Christ
[5:48] but I certify you Brethren at the gospel
[5:51] which was preached to me is not after
[5:53] man it's not something that somebody
[5:55] told me
[5:57] verse 12. for I neither receded a man
[6:00] neither was I taught it but by the
[6:03] revelation of Jesus Christ now you might
[6:06] uh you might say okay well we don't need
[6:08] to fight for Ministry well that's not
[6:10] what he's talking about you need the
[6:11] final Ministry to help you but like for
[6:14] example if I tell you if you're sick and
[6:16] I I could tell you my Revelation I
[6:18] believe that you are healed but until
[6:20] you get that Revelation uh it's and when
[6:23] that Revelation is made personal to you
[6:25] then it can be made manifest in your
[6:27] life
[6:29] so that's what Paul is talking about and
[6:32] that's what um as we go through
[6:34] um
[6:36] uh kind of talking about the different
[6:39] versions of the Bible you can say well
[6:42] if I get the right version of the Bible
[6:44] then I'll understand it but brother
[6:47] random talked about how all down through
[6:49] it when when Christ came on the Earth
[6:51] they they had all of their scriptures
[6:54] laid out just perfectly but they missed
[6:56] him because they didn't have the
[6:57] Revelation so in the in the revelation
[7:00] of Jesus Christ the churches book
[7:02] chapter one
[7:03] he said
[7:04] um
[7:05] now you can see
[7:08] um let me go back however before we get
[7:10] too concerned about this let us read
[7:12] both the King James version and the
[7:13] translation by Dr lonza so our
[7:16] gratification we find the words are both
[7:18] amazingly the same so that there is no
[7:19] difference actually in content or
[7:21] doctrine
[7:22] we may even conclude that God has
[7:24] allowed these newly discovered
[7:25] manuscripts and recent publications of
[7:27] already known scripts to come before us
[7:29] to prove the authenticity of what we
[7:30] already had and we find that though
[7:32] translators May fight each other scripts
[7:34] do not
[7:36] now you can see that you can't base
[7:38] interpretation upon a student's profound
[7:41] knowledge of the language the Bible is
[7:42] written in but if you still can't see
[7:45] that because you are veiled in your mind
[7:46] by tradition here is one last
[7:48] illustration
[7:49] no one can doubt but with the scribes
[7:51] and Pharisees and the great Scholars of
[7:53] the Year 33 A.D knew the exact laws of
[7:56] grammar and the exact meanings of the
[7:58] words in which the Old Testament was
[8:00] written but for all their superb
[8:02] knowledge they miss the revelation of
[8:03] God's promise word manifested in the Sun
[8:06] there he was set forth from Genesis to
[8:09] Malachi with whole chapters devoted to
[8:10] him in his ministry and yet except for a
[8:13] few who are eliminated by the spirit
[8:14] they missed him entirely
[8:16] we now come to a conclusion such
[8:18] conclusion as we have already found in
[8:20] the word as much as we believe in trying
[8:22] to find the oldest and best manuscripts
[8:25] to get the best record of the word
[8:26] possible we will never get the true
[8:29] meaning of it by study and comparison of
[8:31] scriptures since series we may be it
[8:33] will take a revelation from God to bring
[8:35] it out that is exactly what Paul said
[8:38] which things we also speak not in Words
[8:40] which man's Wisdom teaches
[8:43] but which the Holy Ghost teaches
[8:45] First Corinthians 2 15. the true
[8:47] Revelation that's God interpreting his
[8:49] own word by vindicating what is promised
[8:52] now don't let anyone be mislead about
[8:54] what I've said and think that I did not
[8:55] believe in the accuracy of the words we
[8:57] now have and I believe this Bible is
[8:59] accurate Jesus completely authenticated
[9:01] by the old test the Old Testament one
[9:03] here on Earth and it was compiled as
[9:05] exactly as was our new testament
[9:08] make no mistake about it we have the
[9:10] infallible word of God today and no man
[9:12] there's take from it or add to it but we
[9:14] need the same spirit that gave it to
[9:16] teach it to us oh how we need Revelation
[9:19] by the spirit we don't need a new Bible
[9:21] we don't need a new translation though
[9:23] some are very good and I'm not against
[9:25] them but we need the revelation of the
[9:28] spirit and thank God we can have what we
[9:30] need for God wants to reveal his word to
[9:33] us by his spirit
[9:35] now when you get at revelation
[9:39] I believe
[9:40] um you know my brother Dale's saying say
[9:43] it in your own words
[9:44] so let's look at um
[9:47] a few places in scripture where in the
[9:50] New Testament they said they quoted
[9:52] something in the Old Testament in their
[9:54] own words
[9:57] so we think you know brother Brown said
[9:59] say just say what's on the tapes so uh
[10:03] you know a lot of times I've I've been
[10:05] over to people's houses where they they
[10:07] know I disagree with them so the first
[10:09] thing I come over they hand me a bunch
[10:11] of quotes a stack of quotes So
[10:15] and then we'll wait while I read through
[10:17] them I believe these quotes brother
[10:20] but
[10:21] if I believe we should be able to say it
[10:24] in our own words if you have a
[10:26] revelation of it
[10:30] um so let's look at um
[10:35] well I'll just kind of compare in Romans
[10:37] 10 20 Paul said
[10:39] but Isaiah is very bold and saith I was
[10:42] found of them that sought me not I Was
[10:43] Made manifest unto them that asked not
[10:45] after me and then he's quoting Isaiah 65
[10:49] that says I have thought of them that
[10:50] asked not for me I'm found of them that
[10:52] sought me not I said behold me behold me
[10:55] unto a nation that was not called by my
[10:58] name
[10:59] in James 4 6 he said but he giveth more
[11:03] grace wherefore he said God resists us
[11:06] the proud but giveth Grace unto the
[11:08] humble and he's quoting Proverbs 3 34.
[11:12] surely he's gone at the scorners but
[11:14] he'd giveth Grace under the lowly it's
[11:17] not a word for word quote he's saying it
[11:19] in his own words
[11:21] in First Peter 2 22 Peter said who
[11:24] didn't know sin neither was God found in
[11:26] his mouth and he's quoting Isaiah 53 9
[11:29] and he made his grave with the wicked
[11:31] and with the rich in his death because
[11:33] he had done no violence neither was any
[11:36] deceit in his mouth
[11:38] with first Peter 4 18 Peter said and if
[11:42] the righteous scarcely be saved worse of
[11:44] the ungodly and The Sinner appeared and
[11:47] he's quoting Proverbs 11 31 behold the
[11:49] righteous shall be recompensed on the
[11:51] earth much more than Wicked in the
[11:53] center
[11:54] so the doctrine is the same but
[11:56] different words
[11:58] and Romans 11 8-10
[12:01] no this is interesting because uh Paul
[12:04] actually takes three different quotes
[12:05] from the box from the Old Testament and
[12:07] combines it all into one statement he
[12:09] says according as it is written God had
[12:11] given them the Spirit of Slumber eyes
[12:13] that they should not see
[12:15] and the ears that they should not hear
[12:16] unto this day and David says let their
[12:19] table we made a snare in a trap on a
[12:20] stumbling block and a recompense unto
[12:22] them let their eyes be darkened that
[12:24] they may not see and bow down their back
[12:26] always and he's quoting Deuteronomy 29
[12:28] yet the Lord has not given you an heart
[12:30] to perceive and eyes to see and here's
[12:32] the here under this day for the Lord
[12:34] hath poured out upon you the spirit of
[12:36] deep sleep and that's close your eyes
[12:38] the prophets and your rulers the serious
[12:41] hath you covered and then he's also
[12:43] quoting Psalms 69 22 23 let their table
[12:46] become a snare before them and that
[12:48] would have said have been for their
[12:49] welfare but it become a trap let their
[12:50] eyes be darker that they see not I make
[12:53] their own ones continue to shake I'm
[12:55] going through this a little fast but all
[12:58] these notes are on the website if you
[12:59] want to print them out or
[13:01] um
[13:02] take a look at them
[13:05] um
[13:05] so
[13:07] our Doctrine
[13:09] maybe you might not say the same words
[13:11] if I asked you to explain one God you
[13:15] might not say the same words that I
[13:16] would but as long as our Doctrine is the
[13:19] same and matches what was the original
[13:21] in the in the beginning Paul's what Paul
[13:24] taught
[13:25] so um
[13:27] let's kind of go through the history of
[13:30] the Bible and uh
[13:32] because I've been uh the history of the
[13:34] translation real quick in in maybe five
[13:37] minutes or so
[13:39] uh so Matthew started writing
[13:43] uh according to historians about four
[13:45] years after
[13:46] Jesus uh
[13:49] we all right yeah
[13:52] I would just saying what you were saying
[13:54] about it you may not beg your words we
[13:57] might not say the same word but we're
[13:59] getting the same thing
[14:00] Don's dad in him when I would talk to
[14:03] them about that about something and they
[14:06] would always try to correct me well I
[14:09] was saying the same thing as them I just
[14:10] wasn't using the words they were using
[14:13] yeah so yeah lots of both of them was
[14:15] talking last night about a Bible study
[14:17] about how people don't listen to what
[14:19] you're saying they will try to come up
[14:21] with our response in our head yeah we're
[14:24] really well he kind of said that's what
[14:26] a Bible meant he said I put it in
[14:28] Vietnam right they brought break it down
[14:30] in little ones so he was leaning there
[14:32] not saying exactly what I say but
[14:35] they're breaking it down for the people
[14:37] right
[14:39] huh
[14:40] excuse me I think that proves you have a
[14:43] revelation when you don't quote what
[14:46] somebody else says right it's not the
[14:47] same thing but it's in your words yeah
[14:50] absolutely exactly you're understanding
[14:53] right right
[14:57] absolutely didn't mean to interrupt yeah
[14:59] no that's fine
[15:01] that was here the attitude of discussion
[15:06] um
[15:07] so uh you know most people say a lot of
[15:10] people say that the
[15:12] scriptures weren't recorded until you
[15:14] know hundreds of years after the after
[15:16] uh Jesus died and rose again but Matthew
[15:20] started writing but just four years
[15:21] after the after he rose and then uh
[15:25] John uh you know he was very old close
[15:28] to a hundred they say
[15:30] um he started his school as a scribe as
[15:32] a copy scriptures down right there and
[15:34] they were written by eyewitnesses and
[15:36] the way they wrote because they all get
[15:37] in a circle around somebody in the
[15:39] middle that would
[15:42] um call out or read the scripture they
[15:46] would all write down maybe a chapter or
[15:48] however a long was predetermined and
[15:51] then it all switched places and they
[15:53] could read again and then go back and
[15:54] double check
[15:56] uh to make sure because they were very
[15:58] concerned that the word was accurate if
[16:01] it was not if one word was off when they
[16:03] double checked it throw that page out
[16:05] and write it again
[16:07] then they went through 10 official Roman
[16:09] persecutions called uh the Odio Humanity
[16:13] generis which is Latin for hate crimes
[16:17] you got that out
[16:23] I I might not have gotten that out I
[16:27] just uh
[16:31] uh and through Nero demetian trading now
[16:35] the mission uh
[16:37] around the time is the one that boiled
[16:40] John and old because the mission took
[16:43] the name Dominus which means Lord and he
[16:46] thought he thought that he was God so he
[16:48] said well John's writing these uh he
[16:50] heard about John putting out these Works
[16:52] about
[16:53] um another lure and he said I'm gonna we
[16:56] gotta do something about him so he
[16:58] bowled him in oil
[17:00] and you can on Wikipedia you can still
[17:02] find a picture of the gate station is
[17:04] still there where he was bowling all
[17:06] right in front of that so he can still
[17:08] visit it visit it but uh you know
[17:10] brother Brown was talking about it what
[17:12] was on the inside of John so permeated
[17:14] his whole being until it it quickened
[17:17] his flesh and they couldn't Bowl it
[17:19] um
[17:20] and then uh
[17:23] in Acts
[17:26] uh on the day of Pentecost the gospel
[17:28] went into all the different nations and
[17:30] they say that the uh one of those
[17:32] Nations was the Goths
[17:34] which uh went into Romania and Bulgaria
[17:38] and uh there was a Gothic a goth uh
[17:41] missionary by the name of wolfula and
[17:44] which means a little wolf and he was
[17:46] ordained by this man named eusebius and
[17:48] he took the gospel to The Goth Goths and
[17:51] this is kind of important to compare the
[17:52] scripture because if you look down uh
[17:55] through all the different Bible
[17:56] translations the gothic Bible was
[17:59] translated around uh It Was Written
[18:01] around 300 A.D so it's one of the
[18:04] earliest Bibles that we can kind of
[18:05] compare against so compare the gothic
[18:08] Bible with the Anglo-Saxon Bible and the
[18:10] Wycliffe Bible Nintendo Bible and the
[18:12] Geneva Bible the Bishops Bible on the
[18:13] King James version and this book if you
[18:16] if you're interested in reading it goes
[18:17] through all the comparisons to show you
[18:19] that
[18:20] little like a lot of these modern day
[18:22] translations that have big pots and
[18:24] houses with their own agenda behind it
[18:25] the the
[18:27] um what is written down lines up so
[18:30] perfectly from all the way from the
[18:32] gothic Bible which is uh
[18:36] goth is really like an early version of
[18:38] the English language so I guess it's the
[18:40] earliest version of English it went from
[18:42] Gothic to Anglo-Saxon to on down to the
[18:45] modern day English
[18:47] so um
[18:48] then we get to the King James version
[18:52] King James was a lot of people a modern
[18:55] day critics say he wasn't a Christian
[18:56] man but he wrote this uh
[19:00] he wrote a book for his son called the
[19:02] basilicum doron that um you know he
[19:06] encouraged his son to count every sin
[19:07] and breach of God's law not according as
[19:09] the vain world esteems of it but as God
[19:12] judge and maker of the law accounts the
[19:13] same
[19:14] he said that all all that is necessary
[19:17] for salvation is contained in the
[19:18] scripture and the whole scripture is
[19:21] dictated by God's spirit and so he said
[19:24] to translate the King James version he
[19:27] set up
[19:28] um he put in he made I think it was 15
[19:31] or so rules that the translator should
[19:34] fall and put them in different
[19:35] committees and the way that it worked is
[19:38] to eat some media committee would submit
[19:40] suggestions for
[19:42] um updates to the different
[19:45] Source texts that they were looking at
[19:48] and uh the bottom line is after they
[19:51] after they end up reviewing it every
[19:52] word in the Bible got looked at 14 times
[19:55] every word in the Bible because they
[19:57] were just as concerned as they were in
[20:00] John's School of scribes that every word
[20:02] be just perfectly in line
[20:06] and another thing is
[20:08] um and you know in the software world we
[20:10] call Open Source software software where
[20:12] anybody can contribute well this was the
[20:15] first Open Source book because they
[20:17] allowed anybody to contribute it was
[20:19] open to everyone not just uh the
[20:23] the
[20:24] scholars and whatnot but any anybody
[20:27] could say um I've been looking at this
[20:29] particular scripture and I think this
[20:31] you know The Bishop's Bible of the
[20:32] Geneva Bible has this a little bit wrong
[20:34] you could so if you could say you could
[20:36] submit something to the translators they
[20:38] might not use it but they would consider
[20:40] it
[20:41] so it was the first translation that any
[20:44] it was kind of open to the entire to the
[20:47] entire bride
[20:50] and um
[20:52] so
[20:54] now let's look at a few difficulties
[20:56] with the King James version that brother
[20:58] Brandon poured it out the first one is
[21:00] acts 238 you don't have to turn that
[21:02] because we're all familiar with
[21:05] Ben Peter said that they repent and be
[21:07] baptized every one of you in the name of
[21:09] Jesus Christ for their mission of sins
[21:10] and he shall receive the gift with only
[21:12] gift
[21:14] now who would know this but a prophet
[21:17] that is missing a very key word Lord
[21:20] Jesus Christ because King James version
[21:22] says Jesus Christ but he said um
[21:27] now let me see it
[21:29] I like to hear my sisters and your
[21:31] Brotherhood president Matthew said
[21:32] father son Holy Ghost now if you all go
[21:34] get the emphatic Diagon or the Greek
[21:36] interpretation it happens to be that I
[21:38] have on the side of print now
[21:39] Peter said repent everyone and be
[21:41] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[21:43] Christ the King James version said in
[21:45] the name of Jesus Christ but in the
[21:46] emphatic Diagon it says in the name of
[21:48] the Lord Jesus Christ
[21:49] now when you won this brother and just
[21:51] baptize the name of Jesus there's just
[21:53] me and Jesus but there's only one he was
[21:55] born crisis of God that's his name
[21:57] that's what he has Christ means the
[21:59] anointed one Messiah Christ now Jesus
[22:00] eight days later he was given the name
[22:02] Jesus when he was circumcised and he is
[22:04] our Lord so he is our Lord Jesus Christ
[22:07] and the next one is um
[22:11] John 14 2 in my father's house I mean
[22:14] mansions
[22:15] if it were not so I would have told you
[22:17] I get to prepare a place for you now
[22:20] this is not necessarily a mistake it's
[22:22] just something that he clarified for us
[22:24] to help us understand and a lot of
[22:26] modern day translations translate
[22:28] Mansion as room or apartment but the the
[22:31] what is what the thought of it is in his
[22:34] father in The Father's Kingdom were many
[22:36] mansions when brother Reynolds said in
[22:38] the original it said in my father's
[22:39] Kingdom there's many palaces
[22:41] because a house can't how do you get a a
[22:44] house is it like a building house it's
[22:46] the kingdom like how they would speak in
[22:49] the when they were riding the King James
[22:51] version back in King James day
[22:53] and the next is um Revelation 1 12 and
[22:58] let's turn to see the voice and we're
[23:00] all familiar with these I'm just kind of
[23:01] doing overview I turned to see the voice
[23:03] to speak with me and being turned I saw
[23:05] seven golden candlesticks and we know
[23:08] brother Ram said that was
[23:10] should be lamp stands because uh it's
[23:13] got to have the same mold in every
[23:17] church and um
[23:20] not just a candle
[23:22] really
[23:24] all right
[23:26] now right
[23:30] Revelation 17 3
[23:32] so he carried me away in the spirit Into
[23:35] the Wilderness I saw a woman sit upon a
[23:37] scarlet color Beast full of names of
[23:38] blasphemy having seven heads and ten
[23:40] horns and brothers said and why a while
[23:43] I'm against organized religion
[23:45] that it should be full of Blasphemous
[23:48] names
[23:50] and he said uh in return in Jubilee and
[23:52] you see that the King James put it she
[23:54] had names of blasphemy but in the
[23:56] original thy Glide it said she was full
[23:57] of Blasphemous names what a difference
[24:00] from names of blasphemy name's a
[24:02] blasphemy to Blasphemous names that
[24:05] means to me I don't know if I'm wrong
[24:07] God forgive me but it means churches
[24:08] that it took on has took on the names of
[24:10] Christianity that live like the world
[24:12] and act like the world and do the things
[24:14] of the world has brought our disgrace
[24:16] upon the True Church of the Living God
[24:18] and they join those you might join the
[24:20] Methodist large Presbyterian launch of
[24:22] the Pentecostal laws but you cannot join
[24:24] the church
[24:25] you must be born into the church by the
[24:27] baptism of the holy spirit that is true
[24:30] so we read earlier we're talking about
[24:33] Galatians that uh the particular
[24:36] translation is not going to give you the
[24:37] Revelation that the Revelation has to
[24:39] come from God but um
[24:42] a lot of these new translations you got
[24:44] to be careful because the they leave out
[24:46] whole verses and and uh words that
[24:50] change change the doctrine so let's kind
[24:52] of quickly go through
[24:54] um
[24:57] some of the differences
[25:00] and Mark took 13 33
[25:02] and you don't have to turn on just kind
[25:04] of read the Anglo-Saxon said Watch and
[25:07] Pray Wycliffe said watch you and pray
[25:09] Tyndall said Watch and Pray Geneva said
[25:11] Watch and Pray Bishops watch and pray
[25:13] the King James version says watch and
[25:16] pray but it's changed a little bit in
[25:18] these new versions The NIV says be alert
[25:21] the nasb says keep on the alert get a
[25:24] Cavalry version says stay awake
[25:26] and the Jehovah's Witness version says
[25:28] stay awake instead of watching pray so
[25:30] you miss that watch and pray
[25:33] and uh
[25:36] First Timothy 2 7 where unto I am
[25:39] ordained a preacher an apostle I speak
[25:40] the truth in Christ and why not now in
[25:44] uh
[25:45] I have a long list of different versions
[25:47] that just leave out the in Christ
[25:50] in Luke 2 33 and Joseph and his mother
[25:53] Marvel at those things which were spoken
[25:55] of him
[25:56] and I have another long list of
[25:58] translations that change Joseph
[26:01] to the child's father or Jesus parents
[26:04] or his father and mother for Jesus
[26:06] father and mother see how it's changing
[26:08] is changing the testimony that Joseph
[26:10] wasn't his father
[26:12] dude he was his father so it's not right
[26:16] you gotta be careful and um if you want
[26:19] to compare all these versions a real
[26:21] easy way to do it is to go to
[26:23] www.bible.cc and type in a scripture
[26:26] it'll give you
[26:27] um that scripture in probably 20
[26:29] different
[26:30] um
[26:31] versions that's a real good study
[26:34] resource
[26:45] that's not.com
[26:49] CC
[26:52] a lot of people are using a lot of
[26:53] websites I started using a cc domain for
[26:55] just to First Christian Church even
[26:58] though that's not originally what it was
[27:00] intended for
[27:02] um
[27:08] Luke 9 55 but he turned and rejected him
[27:11] and said you know not what manner of
[27:13] spirit you are of and a lot of the
[27:16] modern translation is completely removed
[27:18] that part and said you know not what
[27:20] manner of spirit you are of
[27:26] so I've got all these in the note I'm
[27:28] going to skip through some of those um
[27:30] it's just something to be aware of and
[27:33] we're all familiar with the
[27:35] the
[27:36] um
[27:37] thank you
[27:38] this is the fame of the most famous era
[27:41] I guess especially the message Believers
[27:42] it's Matthew 24 28 it says wherever they
[27:45] carcass is they were the Eagles be at
[27:47] the together and almost all the modern
[27:49] translations render Eagles as vultures
[27:51] which
[27:56] changes the meaning a whole lot
[28:01] so uh and then program talked about the
[28:04] emphatic dye gloss and what a diaglot is
[28:06] is where you got
[28:07] um
[28:09] two pages or uh you got your pages put
[28:13] up into two Farms or
[28:15] um something on the left something on
[28:17] the right so they usually have maybe
[28:19] like the grease on the left and the
[28:21] English on the right
[28:23] and a polyglot is a
[28:27] teach me all these fancy words but I
[28:30] probably go out is like more than two so
[28:33] that's why it's called the emphatic
[28:35] dialogue I'm not sure why where the
[28:36] emphatic came from but um
[28:39] so brother Randolph said about the
[28:41] emphatic dog a lot now I've got an
[28:42] emphatic dog out of the original Greek
[28:44] translation it's the one most
[28:46] outstanding things I'd advise it to any
[28:48] of the clergyman
[28:50] it's not a print but I think you can get
[28:52] it in England I'm not sure but I have
[28:53] one that's very old and it brings it
[28:55] down just the original Greek word and it
[28:57] comes over on the other side and just
[28:59] puts it because in the Greek verb is
[29:01] before the adverb you see and it just
[29:02] turns it around so you can read it out
[29:04] you can just read it off if it's one
[29:06] word write down just as he said it
[29:10] um so the in fact dog lot was was
[29:12] published in um
[29:14] in the 1800s by a man that inventional
[29:17] Wilson
[29:18] and he uh the neat thing about the
[29:20] anesthetic diagram is it puts the Greek
[29:22] word by word on the left and then
[29:25] underneath it it was the English
[29:26] translation for each word
[29:30] and then on the right it kind of tells
[29:33] you kind of uh polishes up to English to
[29:36] make it easier to read in a sense so you
[29:38] can go through each word and see what
[29:40] the original Greek meant
[29:42] and um
[29:45] now it originally was um
[29:51] for sale but now it's the copyright has
[29:53] expired so you can get it online for
[29:55] free or you can you can buy uh you can
[29:58] buy one of the original 1900 printing
[30:00] like the one that brother Brandon said
[30:01] he had the leather bound if you can find
[30:03] you can find them on Watchtower the
[30:05] world because the I was gonna say I've
[30:08] actually got a lady that I used to work
[30:10] with who's actually a witness and I've
[30:12] worked with her and she's actually
[30:13] ordered some for me in the three bag
[30:15] lots and so we're waiting for them to
[30:17] come as soon as they come I didn't want
[30:19] to say anything about how many I have
[30:20] could I don't know until we get them and
[30:22] she said that they're supposed to be
[30:23] shipped and they're supposed to be on
[30:24] their way excellent so they take
[30:27] donations so whatever whatever I get I'm
[30:29] gonna bring them and say what are you
[30:30] gonna pay us let's go from there so this
[30:31] is how many I have okay so I thought
[30:33] everybody liked it
[30:36] if you go to the Watchtower store and
[30:39] they have some of the original ones that
[30:41] I use for sale online and they're about
[30:43] 200 each or you can go on to the um to
[30:47] archive.org
[30:52] is this a little print a whole lot of
[30:53] anymore they're mainly on CD yeah
[30:55] they're very rare but um but they have
[30:57] done a new printing machine disorder I
[30:59] think she told me she ordered 20 of them
[31:01] so hopefully we'll get 20.
[31:04] there might be a rush on them
[31:08] but uh I'm just kind of giving y'all
[31:11] some resources if you go to archived
[31:13] over we're going to have a lot it's an
[31:14] archive a free

[31:39] was just I had a few resources at the
[31:41] bottom of this document yeah I know that
[31:43] um some of us don't have the if you have
[31:46] a copy of the table or the other
[31:48] software that lets you search that that
