[53:14] listening to our elder ministers and
[53:16] learning by them they are staying close
[53:18] as we can to what's right when we follow

[1:39:29] in the book of first corinthians chapter

[1:39:42] first writtens chapter 15 and we'll
[1:39:45] start in verse 45
[1:39:47] first Corinthians 15:45 and so it is
[1:39:53] written the first man Adam was made a
[1:39:56] living soul the last Adam was made a
[1:39:59] quickening spirit howbeit that was not
[1:40:02] first which is spiritual but that which
[1:40:04] is natural and afterward that which is
[1:40:07] spiritual the first man is of the earth
[1:40:09] earthy the second man is the lord from
[1:40:12] heaven as is the earthy such are they
[1:40:15] also that are dirty and as is the
[1:40:18] heavenly such are they also that are
[1:40:21] heavenly and as we have borne the image
[1:40:24] of the earthy we shall also bear the
[1:40:28] image of the heavenly even you may be
[1:40:30] seated in the Lord at the blessings to
[1:40:33] the ring of the word I like to call your
[1:40:35] attention to verse 49 and as we have
[1:40:39] more of the image of the earthy we shall
[1:40:41] also bear the image of the heavenly we
[1:40:44] shall also bear the image of the head a
[1:40:49] map and I would like to speak for a few
[1:40:52] moments by the health of the Lord and
[1:40:54] that home brother Homer you know
[1:40:56] stresses amen 30 minutes that fellowship
[1:40:59] means and brother pageant believe you
[1:41:01] said it give me thirty two and a half
[1:41:03] minutes I believe so by the grace the
[1:41:05] Lord will try to share something in
[1:41:08] these next few minutes that cannot see a
[1:41:10] blessing but my total bearing the image
[1:41:13] amen to put all or beware the image
[1:41:17] there is an image that you and I are is
[1:41:19] embarrass the bride is Jesus Christ and
[1:41:21] that's the Bride of Christ we have no
[1:41:24] glory our role and we're not to bear our
[1:41:26] own image we don't come in our own name
[1:41:28] but whenever we come in this union with
[1:41:30] cry
[1:41:31] we take on his image we reflect his
[1:41:33] attributes we have to reflect him
[1:41:35] everything that he is we are to reflect
[1:41:38] that and we take hold his name we become
[1:41:41] mrs. cries hey mister brother Brandi
[1:41:45] said that my last name was Roy he said
[1:41:48] that I already brown a man my wife was
[1:41:52] Cleveland and when she married me she
[1:41:54] took all my name's she became an
[1:41:55] elephants whenever that we is the bride
[1:41:57] in Christ we've been come into a oneness
[1:41:59] and unity with the Lord and we take on
[1:42:02] the name of Christ that's why today
[1:42:04] we're not known as necessarily a Baptist
[1:42:06] or Methodist or Pentecostals but we're
[1:42:08] Christians followers of Christ we become
[1:42:11] a science a madden what is that Brian we
[1:42:14] have the barest image were to reflect
[1:42:16] him and the image that we aware the
[1:42:19] image that we carry that shows it is a
[1:42:22] reflection of our identity is what if we
[1:42:25] are identified and known as to everyone
[1:42:27] around us and one that we see them we
[1:42:29] are know by image that we marry in 1959
[1:42:34] for the RAM preached images of Christ
[1:42:36] and he said but we must in our souls
[1:42:39] reflect his spirit image and his manner
[1:42:42] of life I do not believe that Christians
[1:42:45] consist of joining churches and creeds I
[1:42:48] believe it's a reflection of Jesus
[1:42:50] Christ in the human being for we are his
[1:42:53] members the members of his body and we
[1:42:56] bear his image the scripture says now
[1:42:59] the churches cook in chapter 3 about the
[1:43:03] indecent church a program set price this
[1:43:05] hood says the true Church of Jesus
[1:43:08] Christ
[1:43:08] the bride is likened to pure gold her
[1:43:12] righteousness is his righteousness
[1:43:15] her arteries her after each are his own
[1:43:18] glorious attributes her identity is
[1:43:21] found in him what is
[1:43:24] she is reflect what he has she is to
[1:43:27] manifest there is no fault in her she is
[1:43:31] all glorious within and without from
[1:43:33] beginning to end easiest work of her
[1:43:35] Lord and all his works are perfect and
[1:43:39] fine in her is summed up and manifested
[1:43:43] the eternal wisdom and purpose of God
[1:43:45] how could one battlin have a good one
[1:43:48] understanding though we cannot do that
[1:43:50] we can accept it by faith for God hath
[1:43:53] spoken
[1:43:53] he said we final fall to her she's
[1:43:57] glorious within without the Bride of
[1:43:59] Christ but it's not her lorry that's not
[1:44:02] relaxed but all the bride does my
[1:44:05] cuticle it reflects everything that
[1:44:07] Christ is the wishes driver's life yeah
[1:44:11] now we look at our world today and we're
[1:44:15] truly living in a messed up world that's
[1:44:18] tough I stand anymore not a man we can
[1:44:21] tell that identified by the Scriptures
[1:44:24] we are definitely living in the land of
[1:44:26] C&H amen all the prophecies have been
[1:44:28] fulfilled before us and we look at the
[1:44:31] people in the world today how they're so
[1:44:34] confused and how the people this world
[1:44:38] today they don't know who they are they
[1:44:40] don't know where they come from and they
[1:44:43] certainly don't know where there goes in
[1:44:46] fact today people who world don't even
[1:44:48] know what fail they don't know if
[1:44:50] they're male or female nothing's so
[1:44:53] confused completely deranged it's
[1:44:55] nothing more than
[1:44:56] they don't really know since that and
[1:45:00] today they look and they call it an
[1:45:03] identity crisis they don't know what the
[1:45:06] purpose of that life is they don't know
[1:45:08] who they really are they don't know that
[1:45:11] enrolled in society they don't know what
[1:45:13] they're supposed to be doing that if
[1:45:14] thrown into an identity crisis we also
[1:45:17] know that we are living today in an age
[1:45:20] full of fear there's all kinds of fears
[1:45:24] in the nation fears in the political
[1:45:27] realm phil fears across the world with
[1:45:30] wars agree.i all this and we have fears
[1:45:34] in the local community some crime and
[1:45:37] visionary and murderers and all kinds of
[1:45:40] things to be afraid of so many things to
[1:45:43] be scared of in this late hour that
[1:45:45] we're living in the bio said in the last
[1:45:47] days that men's hearts will be failing
[1:45:49] them for fear because we're living in a
[1:45:52] fearful age and one of the main things
[1:45:55] today that people are so afraid of and I
[1:46:00] know you don't have a television but if
[1:46:02] you did it on the commercials they're
[1:46:04] cops they talking about something called
[1:46:06] identity theft you can hear on the radio
[1:46:08] you can agree about in the newspapers
[1:46:11] and magazines people be through
[1:46:14] computers and technology they can take
[1:46:17] everything you old everything I every
[1:46:20] diamond their bank accounts all your
[1:46:22] possessions they can steal it from you
[1:46:24] without ever even meeting you without
[1:46:28] ever even stepping on your property
[1:46:30] without ever breaking into any kind of
[1:46:32] physical structure they can steal
[1:46:34] everything for you electronically do
[1:46:36] identity death thank you
[1:46:38] stealing your identity and use it to
[1:46:40] open up bank accounts and credit cards
[1:46:42] for your needs and so people will spend
[1:46:45] thousands of dollars on these companies
[1:46:47] that will protect identity theft fraud
[1:46:50] protection companies make money by
[1:46:53] protecting your identity now and you
[1:46:57] know think about it how there was a time
[1:46:59] but in Queens the Bride of Christ we
[1:47:02] didn't know who we were there was a time
[1:47:05] that we didn't understand who we really
[1:47:08] were because I didn t happen to stole
[1:47:11] from us we were made victims to identity
[1:47:15] theft back in the Garden of Eden so we
[1:47:20] can go back there and well this message
[1:47:22] is no other Church no the preacher has
[1:47:25] been ever been able to tell us what
[1:47:27] happened before Genesis 1:1 but we had a
[1:47:30] prophet that contained us before Genesis
[1:47:33] 1:1 into the mind of God and we sing in
[1:47:37] the creation story after Genesis 1:1 of
[1:47:40] God and the story of creation how when
[1:47:43] God created Adam Adam was like an
[1:47:47] amateur God for the random second right
[1:47:49] and was made to be a creator and half
[1:47:52] full rein in jurisdiction over God's
[1:47:55] creation he was to completely rule this
[1:47:59] earth as an immature God because he was
[1:48:01] a son of God he was made in the image
[1:48:03] and likeness of God according Scripture
[1:48:05] and he ruled the earth and how Adam has
[1:48:11] that son of God he held in his hand the
[1:48:14] book of Redemption that was given to him
[1:48:16] by God Almighty and he had a reign of
[1:48:19] that and the animals God would read even
[1:48:21] when you always like the name
[1:48:23] I don't got to name the animals yes and
[1:48:26] he has that book of addiction now the
[1:48:30] letter Eve was borne out and conquer the
[1:48:33] mire of all the lady but comes true the
[1:48:36] original preach I'm gone it was perfect
[1:48:38] because God doesn't do anything is not
[1:48:41] hurt what happens is Satan he's not able
[1:48:44] to create all they can do for her but
[1:48:46] God has already created and so we look
[1:48:50] at this how God's original plan
[1:48:53] Adam and Eve were so designed that they
[1:48:56] would have never died they were designed
[1:48:59] to be eternal beings they're in that
[1:49:01] garden that books are bitching out of
[1:49:05] hell they had all our names in that book
[1:49:07] because they were put there before the
[1:49:10] foundation of the world
[1:49:11] they met before this world was created
[1:49:13] existence or nature or any on that book
[1:49:16] in the Matabele and Adam being an
[1:49:20] amateur God he was to speak the names of
[1:49:23] that book and then those names those
[1:49:26] people would be bought for the movie
[1:49:28] because he was to be the mother all this
[1:49:30] that was the weight God originally
[1:49:32] created without physical attraction
[1:49:36] without carnal knowledge without a snake
[1:49:39] sack we were all to be born by the
[1:49:41] spoken word just Heineman enormous
[1:49:45] where we whose names from that book we
[1:49:48] were to be born through the one of thee
[1:49:49] by the spoken word yeah but then st. it
[1:49:54] created through the love of God where he
[1:49:57] crept in through deceit and how however
[1:50:02] was not the scenic on the scripture evil
[1:50:04] looks but because of the love that Adam
[1:50:07] had for us why he will brown and death
[1:50:10] with her and brother Graham sent in the
[1:50:15] first seal how do we said he forfeited
[1:50:18] the book of life for the knowledge of
[1:50:20] Satan and lost his inheritance lost
[1:50:23] everything and no way for redemption
[1:50:26] whatever Adam chose to walk back with
[1:50:29] his wife at the death he hated that book
[1:50:32] or intention or the title deed to
[1:50:34] eternal life he handed it over to Satan
[1:50:37] and that is how st. became the god of
[1:50:40] this world and now he would be known as
[1:50:42] the priests of Xavier that Donald is he
[1:50:44] late now it was corrupted and perverted
[1:50:47] in it now we know this Satan season but
[1:50:52] Satan could not hold the book his hands
[1:50:56] could take it so the title deed went
[1:50:59] back into the hands of the original

[1:59:00] this surgery back to the same we believe
[1:59:02] the exact same thing that whole believe

[1:59:06] coming in this hour that preached exact
[1:59:08] same thing Paul preached for this ensure

[1:59:17] base but the original Apostolic fathers

[1:59:26] thing that Paul preached the remembrance
[1:59:28] brothers and sisters how the prophet saw
[1:59:31] beyond the curtain of time and how when
[1:59:33] that bull is him he began then and then
[1:59:35] I will body experience the Lord
[1:59:37] translator whatever is going on time and
[1:59:39] I've always said once you like to see
[1:59:41] just beyond the curtain and you remember
[1:59:44] any set all the way it would help me so
[1:59:45] much and all my brothers and sisters I
[1:59:48] didn't see what he saw but just to know
[1:59:51] that he'd been there and came back and
[1:59:52] tell us and just to hear it is voice on
[1:59:54] that tape
[1:59:54] a man tells walls beyond that curtain
[1:59:56] just how they live so he said boy it
[1:59:59] would help me so much brother sister a
[2:00:00] helps me so much so much it was all
[2:00:05] beyond those people he was gathered as
[2:00:08] people almost numerous converse
[2:00:11] they came running to the channel fiction
[2:00:13] brutal
[2:00:14] maybe we're not seeing it we would not
[2:00:16] be here we judge by what you preach city
[2:00:23] and he said it all screw Medina he said
[2:00:26] it pops Romanian
[2:00:27] my will do a good I'll preach this
[2:00:29] family Nepal breach
[2:01:00] our precious brother and he will be the
[2:01:08] one to present us the Christ on that
[2:01:12] thing as the trophies of his mission
[2:01:15] they said on that day he said I want to
[2:01:18] present you but also there's a chaste
[2:01:21] virgin to Christ he said don't let me
[2:01:24] down don't let me down and God help me I
[2:01:28] don't want my Lord and Savior down right
[2:01:31] over his prophet at home o my brothers
[2:01:34] and sister cousin and let me take my
[2:01:36] freedom you can hardly wait you're a
[2:01:38] part of I'm in elegance and there's
[2:01:42] absolutely nothing I can do to change
[2:01:44] that I couldn't be anything else even if
[2:01:46] I wanted to and I'm afraid you cannot
[2:01:49] believe this message even if you wanted
[2:01:51] to go to the pretest and see them off
[2:01:53] it's for you and you cannot even believe
[2:01:57] it and we're going to do it in an hour
[2:01:59] where people have walked away to the
[2:02:01] message but they walk away from it
[2:02:03] because they were
[2:02:06] because they ruin video of us they would
[2:02:12] no doubt still been here today but it
[2:02:14] was time that they be manifested in
[2:02:16] cycle if they were to an hour would say
[2:02:19] Micah people were leaving the message in
[2:02:28] there and it didn't matter to me
[2:02:44] Amen what John Collins and all they
[2:02:46] won't believe the science thing I read
[2:02:48] every article they got one with me every
[2:02:52] contradiction they kind of say a
[2:02:54] contradiction every time they say he
[2:02:56] missed a hearing a message there I'm
[2:02:58] finishing it because let me take my eyes
[2:03:01] my eyes to be wholly going to say what
[2:03:07] you want to a man John Collins tell them
[2:03:09] if they're actually prophecy been
[2:03:11] famille it was a promise I thought they
[2:03:14] would do this they don't realize it but
[2:03:16] they're fulfilling a prophecy that
[2:03:17] program set up and they're not even they
[2:03:20] only rather fill these props because
[2:03:22] it's in this hour that just like is
[2:03:25] Tennyson Timbers footstools so they
[2:03:28] raised up but then sweet kids got profit
[2:03:31] this week against the truth of this
[2:03:33] master team representing northern ones
[2:03:36] at the end time these three things have
[2:03:38] been fulfilled he said first the world
[2:03:41] is in a started conditioned to believe
[2:03:43] that say man it's in night out or
[2:03:46] important structure here that Tennyson
[2:03:48] Timbers appearance did what you think
[2:03:50] that thirdly it's in that same hour that
[2:03:54] the son of man is to be revealed and you
[2:03:56] know believe the sign never was right
[2:03:58] even when they were in the message the
[2:04:01] whole name of it's wrong believe the
[2:04:04] sign because the message teaches us that
[2:04:07] there's always a voice that follows the
[2:04:09] sign
[2:04:26] [Applause]
[2:05:03] for the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:05:08] these laws have been anointed by Satan
[2:05:11] to speak against this message false
[2:05:14] Christ all said no anyone's Amen they
[2:05:17] have gone in the way obtained and they
[2:05:20] ran after the error of Balaam then go
[2:05:23] and the game say Nicole rack because
[2:05:26] they're absolutely fulfilling the
[2:05:27] prophecy
[2:05:28] they already Antichrist false I'm going
[2:05:31] to find something again it's the word
[2:05:32] and then we take my freedom this reveal
[2:05:35] word is the word of God to our
[2:05:37] generation this to the not Christ for
[2:05:42] Christ is the word for the Randy
[2:05:44] psychiatrist of one word or even to this
[2:05:47] believe she was in the hall but just go
[2:05:50] sleep in one word one word and let me
[2:05:54] tell you the not one word this revealed
[2:05:56] through tomorrow is for the nitrogen for
[2:05:58] the Christ it's just word to deny the
[2:06:01] oneness of the Godhead is for the not
[2:06:03] parties so they're not water baptism in
[2:06:05] jesus name it is to the night Christ to
[2:06:08] deny the doctrine of a servant Sita it
[2:06:10] is to the novel tries to deny that God
[2:06:13] was sent off in the corn amount of God
[2:06:15] for us it is to the knowledge possessed
[2:06:18] and I'm the word and if you not aware
[2:06:20] you are the nine o'clock
[2:06:24] any man any preacher or any way McGregor
[2:06:27] has the real Holy Ghost and now this
[2:06:30] word sanctified until the Holy Ghost
[2:06:34] I spoke with tongues I shout out damps
[2:06:36] out of the place and whenever I'm in
[2:06:38] this minute I realized I had not even
[2:06:40] had a word again and I did not even know
[2:06:45] who Christ was I'm talking this message
[2:06:47] this message Jesus Taylor's life may
[2:06:58] always be enough
[2:06:59] they don't you realize their name Christ
[2:07:00] there really are
[2:07:22] the real it'll work
[2:07:26] [Applause]
[2:07:54] and this is the image that we are
[2:07:56] debater right well you are to bear the
[2:07:59] image of Christ a word that in this last
[2:08:02] hour my brothers and sisters I'm not
[2:08:06] ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ or
[2:08:08] it's the power of God unto salvation now
[2:08:12] I'm not ashamed but maybe I didn't power
[2:08:14] this message I'm not ashamed to be
[2:08:19] identified with God they call me a brand
[2:08:23] might
[2:08:24] I call myself a rainbow but when they
[2:08:28] call me a brand might shake my head and
[2:08:33] I'll say yes I am
[2:08:35] because I'm ashamed to be identified
[2:08:38] with God no matter where I am around
[2:08:43] them and they got a problem with it the
[2:08:45] making there's going somewhere else
[2:08:46] because brother sister is a dark hour
[2:08:49] and in terms of this world is overriding
[2:08:51] the light of God
[2:08:55] and sister team us to lose our own
[2:08:59] earthly identity so that we can reflect
[2:09:03] the image of Christ because the image of
[2:09:07] Christ that is our true identity one we
[2:09:10] have landed in first Corinthians chapter
[2:09:12] 15 verse 49 and as we have borne the
[2:09:16] image of the earthy weight tune into
[2:09:18] this earth through a sex act through a
[2:09:22] natural physical birth and that's a lamp
[2:09:24] we form a team into the national person
[2:09:27] we shall also bear the image of the
[2:09:31] heavenly
[2:09:31] we're also divinity image of the head
[2:09:36] 1st Corinthians 15:51
[2:09:38] the musicians can come he said behold I
[2:09:42] show you a mystery we shall not all
[2:09:45] sleep but we shall all be changed in a
[2:09:49] moment and the twenty clinging of an eye
[2:09:51] at the last Trump for the trumpet shall
[2:09:54] sound and the dead shall be raised
[2:09:57] incorruptible and we shall be changed
[2:10:01] we shall bear the image of the heavenly
[2:10:03] we shall be cheney's let me say it's
[2:10:08] been a long time coming but brother and
[2:10:10] sister were gone the old time home and
[2:10:13] in the Old Market Scott bus saying where
[2:10:15] it is becoming in the Lord where is that
[2:10:17] rapture and let me take all the nominal
[2:10:19] churches out here Baptist every day
[2:10:21] to say I'm going to God mental not only
[2:10:24] the rapture they'd only know directories
[2:10:28] there is no rapture outside this message
[2:10:30] because this message the only thing that
[2:10:33] got sent to give up prior actions faith
[2:10:35] only the Bride of Christ on the rapture
[2:10:38] and you can be in the message the outer
[2:10:40] it's gonna give you that rapture in vain
[2:10:43] because malachi for the seventh angel
[2:10:46] was sent to us with the material address
[2:10:49] the right and i message came to bring us
[2:10:52] to a rapture thing that we shall not all
[2:10:56] die but we shall all these changes a man
[2:11:00] would you stand at night don't you love
[2:11:04] it
[2:11:05] late I went three minutes over I'm sorry
[2:11:08] for the patch if you look
[2:11:16] [Applause]

[2:11:26] operate seven years and Pentecostal
[2:11:28] movements amen and I could open up a
[2:11:32] sermon and close and call people pray
[2:11:34] within 30 minutes at least every single
[2:11:36] time sometimes 20 minutes and then that
[2:11:39] I'll struggle to keep an hour because
[2:11:42] it's an eternal subject it's so rich you
[2:11:44] know that's why the denominations could
[2:11:47] not handle this mess home it was too
[2:11:49] rich for their stomachs couldn't handle
[2:11:52] it couldn't digest it thank God I found
[2:11:55] a people with the body is we're just
[2:12:02] trying to come together then when I get
[2:12:04] ready to go to that great tension await
[2:12:05] their answers already here and then the
[2:12:08] rapture really began when the message
[2:12:11] went forth that was the shout the Lord
[2:12:13] began to descend when the message
[2:12:15] shouted and now brother and sister you
[2:12:17] have the Holy Ghost that's the rapture
[2:12:19] in human interaction else intentionally
