[23:23] there Friday and Saturday all right
[23:26] everybody say Amen all right I hadn't
[23:29] lost you yet but food and gas is your
[23:31] responsibility outside of what we're
[23:33] going to do at the venues now I talked
[23:37] to brother Andre yesterday Friday we're
[23:40] going to kind of get there when you can
[23:42] or when you want to it's just going to
[23:44] be a fellowship at the Unicoi Park from
[23:46] five until whenever but whenever you get
[23:49] there he's already rented that place and
[23:52] on Saturday we're not going to have it
[23:54] at brother uh Andre's Church we're going
[23:57] to have it he has rented the Methodist
[23:59] Camp Community Center all day so it'll
[24:03] be basketball volleyball we're going to
[24:05] have a worship service with specials get
[24:07] your specials ready use they're going
[24:09] and even adults at probably around five

[24:14] uh and brother Joe can get my brother
[24:15] Andre about the song service we'll find
[24:18] out maybe who's going to speak that
[24:20] afternoon and if we can get Luis there
[24:22] in time maybe we can do it later on in
[24:24] the afternoon all right Sunday will be a
[24:26] regular service and I'll be speaking
[24:27] Sunday morning it's not an afternoon
[24:29] service but I need to know downstairs
[24:32] when you you see that sheet of paper
[24:34] this is important
[24:36] if you're going to stay over now it's
[24:38] about a three and a half hour drive it's
[24:39] very easy to get there three and a half
[24:41] hours from here sorry
[24:43] and then you may be a little bit further
[24:45] in Atlanta
[24:46] but on Sunday afternoon after the
[24:48] service is over we're going to go to a
[24:50] place called The Farmer's Daughter
[24:52] and it's an Amish Restaurant there
[24:54] they've got a place to hold about 50
[24:56] people in the back
[24:57] excuse me brother Andres got that
[25:00] reserve for us for Sunday it is a Amish
[25:04] I mean meat and it ain't a meat in three
[25:07] it's like a meat and 30.
[25:08] because it's an Amish place and they
[25:10] raise their own vegetables they raise
[25:11] their own beef they raise all that stuff
[25:13] at The Farmer's Daughter afterwards so I
[25:16] need to know who's going to stay over
[25:18] for that meal now you will be
[25:20] responsible for that meal
[25:22] also but now whatever we eat at at the
[25:26] two camps which will be Friday evening
[25:28] will be sandwiches and stuff like that
[25:30] uh Saturday we got to get that menu
[25:32] nailed down but like I said before
[25:35] please let us know just like we did with
[25:38] Ohio we'll have an itinerary and let you
[25:41] know when to be there and what's going
[25:44] on but the church will pay for the motel
[25:46] you just need to get there and the food
[25:49] that you eat outside of the venue will
[25:52] be your responsibility so we appreciate
[25:53] brother Dale Pam for the motel rooms
[25:55] because that's the biggest expense is a
[25:57] place to stay so brother Andre said he
[25:59] did not have a place to put 45 people
[26:01] and that's how many signed up to go at
[26:03] the moment so if you want to go though
[26:05] please sign up we want everybody to go
[26:07] we will have service here that Sunday
[26:09] regardless there will be a service here
[26:11] on that Sunday and we'll give you that
[26:14] itinerary
[26:16] later on so all mine's clear Lord bless
[26:19] you thank you for being tentative
[26:20] attentive and for helping in all this
[26:22] and let's go to the Lord in prayer

[27:41] Part 111 yes Jonathan I am slow
[27:46] but we're breaking it down pretty much
[27:48] so this is Part 111 so let's begin with
[27:51] John 1 1. in the beginning was the word
[27:53] the word was with God and the Word was
[27:55] God and that word
[27:58] became flesh
[28:00] or was made flesh and dwelt Among Us now

[28:05] ago but what about in your flesh what
[28:07] about when he comes by the new birth and
[28:09] comes into you and makes your flesh
[28:12] huh the word
[28:14] all right that's what we gotta we gotta
[28:16] see that the statue of perfect man is
[28:18] making us into His Image molding us into
[28:22] his likeness and we behold his glory the
[28:25] glory the only begotten of the father
[28:26] full
[28:29] not halfway
[28:31] full of grace and truth you may be
[28:33] seeing the Lord has blessing to the
[28:34] reading's word second Peter 1 verse 5
[28:37] says besides this giving all diligence
[28:39] out to your faith virtue in the virtue
[28:41] of knowledge and all his Temperance
[28:42] Temperance patience and patience
[28:44] godliness and to Godliness brotherly
[28:46] kindness and the brotherly kindness
[28:47] charity he had a man that had a problem
[28:51] with all these but once he got the new
[28:53] birth
[28:54] he was able to pin it into the Eternal
[28:57] Word of God the man named Peter Peter
[29:00] had issues but God
[29:03] said I prayed for you and he said I
[29:07] prayed for you Peter I know you're gonna
[29:08] get sifted like wheat he's just get
[29:12] behind me saying now he was always
[29:13] letting Peter have it well Amy let Peter
[29:16] have it then guess what he let Peter
[29:18] have this Revelation right here that
[29:20] somebody that way an old naked sailor
[29:22] come on somebody an old naked sailor he
[29:25] could have him write this and it'd be
[29:27] the Eternal Word of God and that we can
[29:29] set in 2023 and see that we have to
[29:31] become that
[29:33] hey man no going back
[29:35] we have to be this we're not walking
[29:37] backwards we're walking forward all
[29:39] right first Timothy 3 16 says without
[29:42] controversy
[29:43] all right great is the mystery of
[29:45] godliness there is a mystery connected
[29:48] to Godliness and you got to get all the
[29:50] way up and you got to have you got to
[29:51] have virtue and you got to have
[29:52] knowledge and Temperance patience all
[29:55] that working in your life and then God
[29:57] requires that you become Godly Now read
[30:00] you a quote I did last week where
[30:01] brother Brown said what so my soul
[30:03] brother I can't do that he said oh yes
[30:04] you can now we believe God sent a
[30:06] prophet right we believe that his words
[30:09] are the words that transferred from the
[30:10] mind of God down through him that little
[30:13] Kentucky Englishman and he spoke and
[30:16] said yes you can
[30:18] yes you can all right all right then I
[30:21] think there is a way amen that we can do
[30:23] it we just got to get in that way not
[30:25] our way this afternoon Lord willing
[30:27] we're going to start on brotherly
[30:29] kindness but the first word we're going
[30:30] to look at is selfishness
[30:34] selfishness
[30:36] amen there is nowhere selfishness should
[30:40] be in Christianity
[30:43] I'll read it to you I don't think I know
[30:45] how quote
[30:47] but look Paul said without controversy
[30:50] so in other words there's no disputation
[30:52] I'm not going to sit here and argue
[30:53] whether you say well I can be Godly and
[30:56] I can't or I can't and I said you can
[30:58] you can
[30:59] there is a way though that you've got to
[31:01] get into in that plan and and God saw
[31:05] Listen by foreknowledge what did God do
[31:07] he saw somebody make it
[31:10] right under this plan he saw a group of
[31:13] people in the end time they made it they
[31:16] came in the open book they understand
[31:18] the healing of the Soul they understand
[31:20] the healing of the body they know that
[31:22] the healing of the soul is is eternal
[31:24] the healing the body is temporary all
[31:27] right everybody with me so there was a
[31:29] mystery and God gave us a prophet that
[31:31] could go down and he would say he would
[31:33] say well cancer starts as a bruised cell
[31:36] now that wasn't in any science book that
[31:39] wasn't into AMA that wasn't in John
[31:42] Hopkins that was in the mind of God he
[31:44] knew that that cell started that part of
[31:47] cancer and he could tell you
[31:49] by what by a vision by somebody by him
[31:52] knowing
[31:53] that there was a great mystery
[31:56] so let's look at that just for a minute
[31:57] because if there's a mystery of
[31:59] godliness we need to see the mystery all
[32:03] right and I we know what the mystery of
[32:04] God is godliness is because Paul told us
[32:07] what it was
[32:08] right it's crafting you the hope of
[32:11] glory Pastor Ministry
[32:14] so mystery is what a hidden thing a
[32:16] secret religious Secrets confided only
[32:20] to the initiated now when you got up
[32:23] this morning and you said I'm coming to
[32:25] church well you didn't say you're coming
[32:26] to church you said you said uh maybe I
[32:29] don't want to go but the one inside of
[32:31] you said let's go
[32:32] okay
[32:34] oh I'm the only one that has that
[32:35] problem oh okay all right well pray for
[32:37] me
[32:38] so you initiated something inside of you
[32:41] that says I'm going to hear from God
[32:44] Amen
[32:46] so you're initiated or not you you said
[32:48] I'm going to get up and go
[32:51] and not to ordinary Mortals if it was
[32:54] the ordinary Mortals this place would be
[32:56] packed full of people
[32:57] if that's what they wanted
[32:59] but we have a hidden secret a hidden or
[33:02] secret thing not obvious to the
[33:04] understanding none of these are obvious
[33:07] to the understanding sure man has their
[33:08] own uh knowledge they have their own
[33:10] Temperance and different things but it's
[33:12] totally contrary to God
[33:14] all right so we got to look at the
[33:16] things that are Godly
[33:17] all who live Godly in Christ what shall
[33:19] what suffer persecution
[33:22] all right number three is a hidden
[33:24] purpose
[33:25] so if there's a mystery behind it it's
[33:27] just it's not just going to be I'm gonna
[33:29] unfold this and then
[33:33] let the air out of the bloom no
[33:36] no it just keeps unfolding and what you
[33:38] see is you see the secret hidden Mystery
[33:42] of God and where he is the secret
[33:44] Council which govern God in dealing with
[33:48] the righteous that's us which are hidden
[33:51] from ungodly
[33:53] and wicked men but plain to The Godly
[33:56] man I saw a mystery should be plain to
[33:58] us uh the prophet of God tells us one
[34:01] place he says the mystery is now what
[34:02] history
[34:04] we have an open book back during the end
[34:07] back during this part of the 2000 years
[34:08] of church ages there was a great mystery
[34:11] what is this seventh seal what is this
[34:14] Elijah coming in Malachi for all they
[34:17] you know they tried their best to hit it
[34:19] but they couldn't
[34:20] it took a profit in the end time to
[34:23] bring us the word of God to open that
[34:25] mystery up and say not William Brown I'm
[34:28] saying here I am Christ saying here I am
[34:31] in you
[34:32] all right
[34:33] brother Brandon was the most unselfish
[34:35] person in the world so we can put him up
[34:37] there where we can see at brotherly
[34:39] kindness that that's why that his son
[34:41] said Remember the greatest one of the
[34:43] greatest qualities of his dad was he did
[34:45] you couldn't tell who was his enemies or
[34:47] friends in other words when him and
[34:49] Billy would drive down the road for
[34:51] thousands of miles remember he didn't
[34:52] like to fly
[34:54] when they drive down the road from
[34:56] Jeffersonville to Arizona at that time
[34:58] it was probably about a 20-something
[35:00] hour trip because it wasn't many
[35:01] interstates back at that time they
[35:03] talked
[35:05] so you know what Billy's Billy's telling
[35:07] us Billy's telling us that brother
[35:08] Brandon didn't for two hours talking
[35:11] about one preacher
[35:17] let that sink in
[35:21] he didn't spend two hours at the table
[35:25] complaining
[35:27] or telling you Billy how wrong this
[35:29] person is or how wrong this church is or
[35:31] how wrong this preacher is
[35:34] Billy couldn't tell
[35:36] so brother Bradham I'll read you in just
[35:38] a minute well no I'll read you this
[35:40] afternoon brother Brown said he got a
[35:41] selfish Spirit on him
[35:45] I'll read it to you brother Branham yeah
[35:48] you know what if you'll read a lot he
[35:49] had plenty of complexes
[35:54] Colossians 1 verse 21 says you that were
[35:57] sometimes alienated and enemies in your
[35:59] mind by Wicked Works yet now hath he
[36:02] reconciled where in the body of his
[36:05] flesh through death to present you what
[36:08] read that with me holy and unblameable
[36:12] an unrepute reprovable in his sight
[36:18] all right not the side of the world but
[36:20] in his sight yes
[36:22] if
[36:24] big word if you continue in the faith
[36:28] grounded and settled and be not moved
[36:31] away from the hope of the Gospel which
[36:33] you have heard yes
[36:34] you have heard the gospel you have no
[36:37] excuse me
[36:39] and which was preached to you wait a
[36:41] minute and not moved away from the hope
[36:42] of the Gospel which you have heard and
[36:44] which was preached to every creature
[36:46] which is under heaven
[36:48] wherefore I Paul and made a minister I
[36:51] like Paul's boldness but you know what
[36:53] he could back it up
[36:55] who now rejoice in my sufferings for you
[36:57] and fill up that which is behind of the
[37:00] afflictions of Christ in my flesh for
[37:02] his body's sake which is the church in
[37:04] other words Paul being unselfish he's
[37:07] giving us listen he didn't have to go to
[37:08] prison
[37:10] he didn't have to go before Pilate I
[37:12] mean uh
[37:13] um in Rome
[37:15] he'd have to
[37:17] the Holy Spirit even warned him to go to
[37:21] Rome
[37:22] right he went anyway
[37:24] now he wasn't out of the will of God
[37:28] he was fulfilling what God saw happen in
[37:31] his life but Paul knew I believe that
[37:34] little part of Paul was always saying
[37:35] man I've got this thing because I put a
[37:39] lot of Christians to death
[37:41] I persecuted the very church that I'm
[37:44] ahead of
[37:46] so so I'm gonna give myself
[37:49] for that church
[37:51] unselfish we'll talk about that this
[37:53] afternoon
[37:54] wherefore I made a minister according to
[37:56] the dispensation of God which is given
[37:58] to me for you to fulfill the word of God
[38:01] now watch even the mystery which hath
[38:04] been hid from ages and generations but
[38:07] now has made manifest to the Saints now
[38:09] Paul is standing in probably the year 80
[38:11] 50 something or 60 something right
[38:13] before he died he's standing there
[38:15] telling us the mystery that was hit from
[38:18] back in the Old Testament until today
[38:20] alrighty
[38:22] and from Generations yes but now has
[38:25] made manifest to his Saints so they got
[38:27] a mystery on unfolding but they didn't
[38:30] get it all
[38:32] right to whom God would make known what
[38:34] is the riches of the glory of this
[38:36] mystery among the Gentiles which is
[38:38] Christ in you the hope of glory
[38:42] whom we preach warning every man and
[38:45] teaching every man in all wisdom look
[38:47] that we may present every man
[38:52] in Christ Jesus
[38:55] Bible I'm just telling you what the
[38:56] Bible said all right wherefore I also
[38:59] labor striving according to his working
[39:01] which worketh in me mightily boy he had
[39:04] something inside of him that he had to
[39:06] get out
[39:08] so we come to this and we see that Paul
[39:12] Paul is telling us that the great
[39:13] mystery is is going to be that that
[39:16] God's going to inhabit a group of people
[39:18] in their human flesh even though they
[39:21] are born in sin even though that that
[39:23] they might be healed and and and and
[39:26] temp It's All Temporary to the outside
[39:28] all right you can be healed to cancer
[39:30] today and die of it tomorrow night
[39:31] that's what brother rap said because
[39:32] what happens is you get that you get
[39:35] whatever you got you get that taken out
[39:37] of you but
[39:39] the fall was I was thinking about this
[39:41] yesterday that fall was so horrible
[39:46] that it separated God and man
[39:48] here stands Adam and Eve nothing going
[39:50] on full Fellowship their bodies being
[39:53] renewed they're not getting older
[39:55] they're not stooping over for hundreds
[39:56] of thousands of years they walked
[39:58] through the garden with God but all of a
[40:00] sudden the fall happened and then the
[40:02] presence of God was separated
[40:05] so that he can't deal with man like he
[40:08] used to so what'd he do he took that he
[40:10] put the curse on his flesh remember he
[40:12] didn't curse Adam
[40:13] he encouraged Adam Saul he couldn't he
[40:17] can't curse his own self if you're born
[40:19] again today you're not under the curse
[40:21] he has revealed to you
[40:24] that you are his and he can't curse
[40:26] himself
[40:27] Hallelujah
[40:31] you're covered
[40:33] man buys blood
[40:36] and he can't ever if he ever loved you
[40:38] he can't unlove you
[40:40] don't ever say God don't love me no more
[40:42] no he don't love you no less either
[40:46] he's loved you from the beginning he
[40:48] can't unlove you you cannot love
[40:51] yourself
[40:53] oh yeah
[40:55] but when Jesus was here he said okay
[40:57] we're going to have this great mystery
[40:59] I'm going to come into this people I'm
[41:01] going to come and be the I'm the Holy
[41:03] Ghost because that's what now you can
[41:06] um agree with me or not but when we're
[41:08] in the Garden of Eden there stands God
[41:10] and Adam and there's nothing in between
[41:13] all right there's no there's no wall
[41:18] total just there's there's really no
[41:20] Mysteries
[41:22] now God withholds a mystery because he
[41:25] knew they were going to fall
[41:27] but he didn't tell Adam
[41:29] because Adam was a free moral agent
[41:32] he let Adam choose right all right we're
[41:36] all on free moral ages he preached on
[41:37] that several several weeks you didn't
[41:40] come here with eternal life and just
[41:43] Lock Stock and Barrel sealed and ready
[41:45] to go I'm sorry you were born in sin now
[41:48] you had representation in the Bible and
[41:51] the word of God you had representation
[41:52] but when you got here you was Dirty
[41:54] Rotten filthy
[41:56] born in sin shaper than the neck with
[41:59] the prophet said bound he said I was on
[42:01] my way to hell
[42:05] but thank God
[42:08] Jesus
[42:09] now we take John 3 16 as the Lord's
[42:12] Prayer right
[42:14] Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be
[42:15] the name thy kingdom come thy will be
[42:17] done all that
[42:18] to me that's to the world
[42:22] to me that's that's to the world like we
[42:24] were talking about last Sunday there's a
[42:25] big difference between being saved and
[42:27] being born again
[42:28] amen big difference you can be saved and
[42:31] be lost and go to hell but you can't be
[42:33] born again and be lost and go to hell so
[42:36] there's a difference and say people can
[42:38] be can be given eternal life but they
[42:40] don't have eternal life right
[42:42] believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and
[42:44] thou shalt be saved now that would be if
[42:46] somebody want to give their heart at a
[42:47] deathbed confession or or something like
[42:50] that and they died they would not go in
[42:52] the sixth Dimension because that's where
[42:54] we would go if we pass away which is the
[42:56] born-again but they would be somewhere
[42:58] and then if the day of judgment they
[43:00] would be given eternal life right
[43:03] but if you're born again
[43:05] like I said before you can be
[43:08] saved and not be born again but you
[43:11] can't be born again and not be saved
[43:12] amen
[43:14] all right you got to go through that
[43:17] salvation plan and if you stop that's
[43:20] your business
[43:21] but the Bible says believe in the Lord
[43:23] Jesus Christ there's a lot of people
[43:24] going to be saved there's not going to
[43:25] be in this group that Jesus came to get
[43:28] amen
[43:31] he wouldn't all be saved but when he
[43:33] come down to the very end yes he died
[43:36] for every person but he knew this group
[43:38] right here would be the only group he
[43:40] was going that was going to receive his
[43:42] Blessing of eternal life and that's his
[43:44] bride or his body is everybody with me
[43:47] John 17 verse 10 says and all mine are
[43:50] thine and thine are mine and I am
[43:52] glorified in them
[43:56] oh
[43:58] where's the glory of God
[44:01] me and you
[44:03] but listen you tell the world that first
[44:05] thing you're going to say what
[44:06] ain't perfect and you ain't perfect
[44:08] don't tell me you perfect well I'm not
[44:11] God told me I was perfect
[44:15] and now I
[44:17] asked to me this is the bride's prayer
[44:19] Brother John
[44:20] this is Jesus praying to put to put a
[44:23] comforter he said he was going to come
[44:25] back send a comforter that'll lead us
[44:27] and got us into all truth right the true
[44:29] Holy Ghost and I saw not just anointing
[44:32] on our spirit realm or even anointing on
[44:35] our bodies everybody with me we know
[44:36] this is Anointed ones at the end time
[44:38] time
[44:39] all right
[44:41] and now I am no more in the world
[44:45] but these are in the world
[44:46] now remember I told you Jesus didn't say
[44:49] father Shield them from the world put a
[44:52] bubble around them make sure that make
[44:55] sure that they don't get no bills no
[44:56] more when they get born again make sure
[44:58] that car don't tear up
[45:01] make sure your house gets somehow
[45:03] supernaturally painted
[45:05] and for your sister supernaturally
[45:07] cleaned
[45:09] I wish
[45:12] everybody with me
[45:14] that's when your problems start is when
[45:16] you become a Christian all right you
[45:18] might get an extra bill
[45:21] but uh but the world's not going to
[45:23] realize
[45:24] and understands you they're not going to
[45:27] understand us
[45:28] they never will because listen I'm gonna
[45:31] read it right here
[45:32] Jesus said you're of me
[45:35] if the world hated me
[45:37] they're gonna hate you
[45:39] but I prayed for you
[45:41] Peters I prayed for you I prayed for you
[45:45] bride
[45:48] this is the prayer to the bride
[45:51] and now I'm no more in the world but
[45:53] these are in the world I come to thee
[45:54] Holy Father
[45:55] keeps doing thy own name now what is the
[45:58] name of the Father the Lord Jesus Christ
[46:00] we know that whom thou has given me that
[46:03] they may be one as we are
[46:08] oh but brother wait I can't be the Bible
[46:11] says yes you can
[46:14] Jesus prayed a prayer have you ever
[46:16] heard a prayer Jesus now listen we
[46:17] prayed a lot of prayers that didn't come
[46:19] to pass hello
[46:20] Jesus never prayed a prayer that didn't
[46:23] come to pass though
[46:24] all right so I'm gonna tell you this
[46:26] prayer is going to come to pass
[46:29] while I was with him in the world I kept
[46:32] him in my name oh yeah he hearded those
[46:34] 12 and one of them was a son of
[46:36] perdition
[46:37] those that thou give us me I have kept
[46:40] and none of them is lost but the Son of
[46:42] Perdition that the scripture might be
[46:43] fulfilled and now come out to thee these
[46:47] things I speak in the world that they
[46:50] might have my joy fulfilled in
[46:52] themselves
[46:55] I have given them Thy Word
[47:00] amen we'll talk about amen that word is
[47:02] a seed all right
[47:04] and the world had hated them
[47:07] because they are not of the world even
[47:09] as I am not of the world
[47:13] I pray
[47:16] not that thou should take them out of
[47:18] the world
[47:19] but that thou should have keep them from
[47:21] the evil yes that's in the world
[47:24] they are not off the

[53:17] with his too man
[53:20] don't tell your daddy I called your
[53:22] daddy
[53:23] no do it please I pay you Genesis 17
[53:27] what when Abram was 90 and nine
[53:30] nobody heard 99 there's one getting
[53:33] close
[53:34] but the Lord appeared to Abram and said
[53:37] I am almighty God walk before me and try
[53:40] to be thou perfect
[53:44] oh it says and be thou perfect
[53:47] Now That Word Perfect is what complete
[53:50] morally innocent having Integrity one
[53:52] who is morally and ethically pure and
[53:55] like I said before
[53:58] when we look at the word godliness we
[54:00] see reverence respect piety towards God
[54:02] and remember I gave you a list for those
[54:05] of you that weren't here
[54:07] we talk about living godliness and then
[54:11] brother Brown says right here
[54:14] said you're moving right on up to line
[54:16] fifthly at godliness Temperance patience
[54:18] wow you say I can't do that brother
[54:20] Branham oh yes you can
[54:23] you can live this godliness
[54:25] you say well I I what do I do
[54:28] listen
[54:31] but when we are judged we're going to
[54:33] read this this afternoon at the
[54:34] communion service but when we are judged
[54:36] we are chastened of the Lord now that
[54:40] word is instructed
[54:43] we are instructed on how to be this
[54:46] godliness
[54:48] that we should not be condemned with the
[54:51] world
[54:51] Saint John 17.
[54:54] he took us out of the condemnation of
[54:55] the world we we are not condemned with
[54:57] the world everybody that's not born
[54:59] again is condemned with the world
[55:00] whatever the world gets they give I
[55:02] don't care if you foolish virgin I don't
[55:04] care if you just saved if you're not
[55:06] filled with the baptism of the Holy
[55:08] Ghost today by the new birth in your
[55:10] soul the old you dead and the New Life
[55:13] coming in to live it through you you
[55:16] will be here when the world is judged
[55:21] sorry about that
[55:25] Noah didn't shut the art
[55:27] God did
[55:29] God's getting ready to shut the ark
[55:37] I told you before we're going to talk
[55:39] about back again
[55:41] um
[55:44] in just a second but I have a list and I
[55:48] want you to kind of think about you see
[55:50] I can't live Godly I can't live this
[55:52] godliness which is piety which is which
[55:55] is uh Perfection as the world would say
[55:57] but we would say it would be completion
[55:59] or how complete we are but not complete
[56:02] according to the world
[56:05] into the Bible
[56:06] hey about with me well I can't I can't I
[56:10] don't know
[56:14] we're not a denomination
[56:17] that makes us closer to God than the
[56:19] denominations
[56:20] because we've been taught
[56:22] we'll talk about the horse forehead in a
[56:24] minute
[56:25] you sisters don't cut your hair well
[56:27] that's what the Bible says so guess what
[56:28] 99.9 of the people in this world are not
[56:31] living Godly because they cut their hair
[56:33] but you are you are living Godly
[56:36] all right
[56:39] dress
[56:42] the world don't mind wearing pants they
[56:44] don't even mind wearing shorts to church
[56:45] now
[56:46] they have no respect
[56:49] but you do
[56:52] and then we've had some that come in
[56:54] Among Us the new people
[56:56] they'd come in wearing pants the girl
[56:58] the ladies and brother Dale never
[57:01] got down and and you know nailed them to
[57:04] a tree
[57:05] you just preached the word
[57:08] something's got to change from inside
[57:09] anyway a lot of y'all I mean a lot of
[57:11] y'all if you if you're wearing pants now
[57:13] then you know you're not born again
[57:14] number one see what I mean you moved
[57:16] yourself from godliness over to this
[57:17] group all right
[57:19] uh what about uh your our actions and as
[57:22] I said before uh many big churches and
[57:25] I'm not knocking them they're doing the
[57:26] best they can but most churches have the
[57:29] program for the widowed a program for
[57:32] the divorced a program for the divorce
[57:34] singles a program for the you understand
[57:37] you understand for the for the
[57:38] alcoholics the a program for the smokers
[57:43] do we need to add on to the church
[57:46] huh
[57:49] well then we're living more Godly than
[57:51] they are
[57:54] everybody with me on this
[57:56] all right
[57:57] our manner of life
[57:59] we don't smoke drink cuss I hope you
[58:02] never get a DUI that means you're drunk
[58:05] but if you don't ever drink
[58:09] well Jonathan if you never drink we
[58:11] don't if you never drink that law of uh
[58:14] blowing 0.08 or whatever it is to make
[58:16] you legally drunk to you don't even
[58:18] worry the books I don't even worry about
[58:20] it I don't keep up with that
[58:23] right but man I'm telling you the people
[58:24] at home
[58:25] being the mayor of the city oh Lord they
[58:28] want to have alcohol in the convenience
[58:29] store and they want to have all this
[58:31] stuff they're worried about that
[58:34] now I'm not worried about it
[58:38] you shouldn't be worried about where the
[58:39] beer costs six dollars a can instead of
[58:41] five
[58:42] but there's a lot of people got up this
[58:45] morning

[59:46] use but explain it to your kids if you

[59:52] contain their self
[59:54] now buy with me yeah all right and it's

[1:06:51] get rid of it right back there
[1:06:53] and then come in here
[1:06:55] and enjoy the service but we know the
[1:06:57] seed is the word of God every time God
[1:07:00] talks about a seed in the Bible and
[1:07:03] brother random talks about a seed he's
[1:07:04] talking about not talking about some
[1:07:06] Wiggly Little sperm with a tail on it
[1:07:08] everybody with me that is not what God
[1:07:12] is all about
[1:07:16] Adam's seed polluted the world his
[1:07:19] natural sperm polluted the world
[1:07:22] hey man brother Brown said that
[1:07:26] we should know it without a quote
[1:07:29] but the seed is the word or the sermon
[1:07:31] you hear
[1:07:33] or the Bible you read all right and the
[1:07:36] ground is yours not this Earth your
[1:07:39] Earth
[1:07:39] today you come to get spiritual water if
[1:07:44] the word has been planted if there's no
[1:07:46] word there
[1:07:48] it ain't coming up because there's no
[1:07:50] seed there to come up
[1:07:51] everybody with me
[1:07:53] so everybody knows the parable of the
[1:07:55] sore of the seed so we're going to
[1:07:56] continue on down a little bit further
[1:07:57] because remember he explained it
[1:08:01] in detail here you therefore the parable
[1:08:04] of the sower all right so is who son of
[1:08:06] man the ministry we're under the son of
[1:08:08] man Ministry we're under the ministry of
[1:08:11] the sower of the seed all right we have
[1:08:13] a former reign
[1:08:15] which is this rain right here
[1:08:18] which is a teaching Reign which is when
[1:08:20] you plant the seed I needed this rain
[1:08:22] for my crops I planted some extra ones
[1:08:24] yesterday so praise God they'll come up
[1:08:26] the other ones didn't because it didn't
[1:08:28] have good moisture all right
[1:08:30] so then there will be a rain in
[1:08:33] September
[1:08:34] or around October that will be a harvest
[1:08:37] rain
[1:08:37] that'll be the rain righted end that
[1:08:39] pops everything to maturity that makes
[1:08:42] that corn of wheat
[1:08:44] get real heavy
[1:08:46] and hang over
[1:08:48] because it's become back to the original
[1:08:51] that's when my apple trees in September
[1:08:53] those things limbs that I used to cut
[1:08:56] grass underneath didn't hit my head I
[1:08:58] hit my head all the time on apples
[1:09:00] why they they they're coming to maturity
[1:09:03] they're heavy
[1:09:05] the apples are big then you get that
[1:09:07] last rain and you know you look at your
[1:09:09] corn Chucks and and they start drying
[1:09:11] out you need that one more good rain to
[1:09:14] just make everything and that's the same
[1:09:15] way with me and you we're gonna have
[1:09:16] that one more good rain
[1:09:18] I believe we're having it now
[1:09:20] to mature the bride to get us ready for
[1:09:24] Harvest to get us ready to get out of
[1:09:26] here amen
[1:09:28] this world is not my home I'm just
[1:09:32] passing through
[1:09:33] right my treasures are laid up wear here
[1:09:36] no somewhere beyond the blue all right
[1:09:38] here you therefore the parable of the
[1:09:39] sore when anyone heareth the word of the
[1:09:43] Kingdom
[1:09:44] and understandeth it not
[1:09:46] then cometh the wicked one and catch us
[1:09:50] away that which was sown look in his
[1:09:53] heart
[1:09:54] now remember be careful that is not the
[1:09:57] heart
[1:09:58] of the soul of you
[1:10:00] Satan can't steal anything out of your
[1:10:02] soul your soul is sealed until the day
[1:10:05] of your Redemption
[1:10:06] Satan can't make your soul sin
[1:10:11] he can't make your soul make a mistake
[1:10:14] we'll be happy in that if you're sealed
[1:10:17] in he's sealed out but now that second
[1:10:19] realm that we're working memory reason
[1:10:21] conscious effects of imagination that is
[1:10:23] his playground God has allowed him yes
[1:10:26] that access to your brain to your memory
[1:10:29] your reasoning your conscious affects
[1:10:30] imagination there's the Battleground
[1:10:33] listen there is no battle in your soul
[1:10:37] if you're born again it's God
[1:10:39] if you're not it's the devil
[1:10:43] that's just plain as black and white
[1:10:46] all right so what are we dealing with
[1:10:48] here with the Statue of perfect man
[1:10:50] though we're dealing with that second
[1:10:53] realm or that Spirit realm of man you
[1:10:56] you
[1:10:58] so sometimes we do hear the word
[1:11:01] but you remember in Ezekiel remember he
[1:11:03] gives he takes the Stony heart out and
[1:11:05] gives you a new new heart brother Brown
[1:11:07] said that's not the new birth
[1:11:09] all right he's trying to soften you up
[1:11:12] under sanctification to get you ready
[1:11:15] for God to come in and we've been taught
[1:11:17] that for 50 something years so we know
[1:11:19] that's the truth
[1:11:21] but now that's sanctification
[1:11:23] that's not the Holy Ghost the good man
[1:11:26] of the house oh sure everything's been
[1:11:28] cleaned out but there's the devil going
[1:11:30] to come back according to Luke right
[1:11:32] unclean Spirit goes out of a man walks
[1:11:34] in dry places comes back
[1:11:37] comes back finds the house swept in
[1:11:40] garnished but the doors are still open
[1:11:43] it's not been sealed
[1:11:46] you need to get it sealed
[1:11:48] until the day of your Redemption
[1:11:50] therefore he cannot get into your that
[1:11:52] part of your house
[1:11:54] when anyone heareth the word of the
[1:11:56] kingdom and understandeth it not
[1:12:00] that means you didn't study that means
[1:12:02] you didn't prepare yourself that means
[1:12:04] you just came here because you was
[1:12:05] afraid I'd say something if you did
[1:12:08] praise the Lord anyhow then coming to
[1:12:11] Wicked one and catch us away
[1:12:14] that which was sown
[1:12:16] in his heart
[1:12:18] we've seen that
[1:12:20] they come here
[1:12:23] they disappear
[1:12:26] this is he which receives seed by the
[1:12:29] wayside
[1:12:31] in other words on their way
[1:12:34] they sat down in the church and heard of
[1:12:35] a message
[1:12:36] and it sounded good it sounded different
[1:12:39] I know something you don't know
[1:12:43] but you got to know Christ first
[1:12:45] you got to get born again first I Pro
[1:12:47] listen I promise you you get born again
[1:12:49] it will take you to the message because
[1:12:50] it has to lead you and guide you into
[1:12:52] Altru it's not just some truth all right
[1:12:54] so you get the Holy Ghost first that's
[1:12:55] my brother Ram said most important get
[1:12:58] the Holy Ghost and it will drive you to
[1:13:00] the message
[1:13:01] listen folks you you don't have to I was
[1:13:05] listening to preacher the other day he
[1:13:06] said you don't have to beg a Christian
[1:13:08] to come to church
[1:13:12] and we still beg and they still don't
[1:13:14] come
[1:13:15] but he that was
[1:13:21] just Stony places what you got some
[1:13:24] issues you had a problem with your wife
[1:13:26] on the way to church or your kids on the
[1:13:28] way to church you got that Stony heart
[1:13:33] you sit here and worry about it I don't
[1:13:35] for me to be quiet so you can go outside
[1:13:37] and bless your wife out or wait a minute
[1:13:39] vice versa
[1:13:41] are your kids
[1:13:43] or your neighbor when I get home I'm
[1:13:45] going to church better time out
[1:13:47] but when I get back
[1:13:51] and I'm gonna drive two or three people
[1:13:52] off the road getting there
[1:13:54] road rage
[1:13:56] yeah it happens
[1:13:58] the same as he that Hearth the word now
[1:13:59] watch here's another one but either
[1:14:01] received seed in the Stony places the
[1:14:03] same as he that here at the word
[1:14:05] all right and are not with joy receiving
[1:14:08] oh man it's great
[1:14:10] but wait I felt some I want you
[1:14:17] like bro dancing
[1:14:20] I'll send you back y'all be shouting and
[1:14:21] speaking in tongues
[1:14:24] so I told William Berlin he was staying
[1:14:25] with us in our when we put the shower in
[1:14:28] we put the
[1:14:30] it's one limit does this and it says hot
[1:14:32] on this side and cold on this side well
[1:14:34] me and dad put it together backwards I
[1:14:36] don't know if he did just to play with
[1:14:37] him
[1:14:38] because that's where we put all the
[1:14:40] preachers at
[1:14:41] so he went over to the hot side it
[1:14:43] stayed cold
[1:14:44] he never did he said this is Heist it
[1:14:47] must be something wrong with the hot
[1:14:48] water heater so he gets in there you can
[1:14:49] hear him wow wow
[1:14:55] come out I said you're not speaking in
[1:14:58] tongue
[1:15:00] he said that water cold
[1:15:03] I said ain't nothing worse than a cold
[1:15:05] preacher
[1:15:07] I said if you'll turn it on the other
[1:15:08] side so we put a little thing June's
[1:15:11] laughing now I'm sure that we put a
[1:15:12] little sign that says this backwards and
[1:15:14] for the use of this is the hot over here
[1:15:15] which says see
[1:15:18] life lesson 769 don't ever do that to a
[1:15:21] preacher the same as he here at the word
[1:15:24] and we receive it with joy shout pink
[1:15:27] and tongue
[1:15:28] yet hath not root he didn't sit there
[1:15:31] long enough or she to get rooted and
[1:15:35] grounded to that when the wind did blow
[1:15:38] it didn't knock your plan over
[1:15:41] some people it knocks him out of church
[1:15:44] some people
[1:15:46] that want it so bad
[1:15:49] their feet
[1:15:51] that tree bends them Roots get loose but
[1:15:54] they don't fall over
[1:15:56] they might get loose a little bit why
[1:15:57] they're loosen the soil up so they can
[1:15:59] grow some more
[1:16:00] they're loosen in the soil that's why
[1:16:02] wind blows
[1:16:03] you either hath no root in himself but
[1:16:06] endureth for a Time hangs around for a
[1:16:09] little while for when tribulation or
[1:16:11] persecution arise oh
[1:16:13] because of what not somebody because of
[1:16:17] the word
[1:16:19] by and by He Is offended
[1:16:23] he also that receives seed among Thorns
[1:16:25] is he that heareth the word
[1:16:28] his sermon comes to church
[1:16:30] and the cares of this world well I got
[1:16:33] to work on Sunday I can't get here on
[1:16:34] Wednesday because I go to work some of
[1:16:36] you have to and I understand but don't
[1:16:39] make it an excuse
[1:16:41] if you make it your crutch then you're
[1:16:43] in this
[1:16:44] part right here
[1:16:46] and the care of this world and the
[1:16:48] deceitfulness of riches
[1:16:50] choke the word
[1:16:53] now the word's not choked you are
[1:16:56] you're choking the word
[1:16:58] and he becometh unfruitful
[1:17:04] but he that receives seed in good ground
[1:17:06] we're just going to say we all had good
[1:17:08] ground today he never received seed or
[1:17:10] heard the message or the word of God
[1:17:12] into good ground is he that heareth the
[1:17:15] word an
[1:17:16] understandeth it
[1:17:19] which also beareth fruit and bringeth
[1:17:22] forth some 100 some 60 and some 30. not
[1:17:26] everybody's going to be a hundred
[1:17:28] my man
[1:17:30] not everybody there's going to be a lot
[1:17:31] of 16 a lot of 30 which means it's a 30
[1:17:34] percent though it was just as important
[1:17:35] as the hundred percent
[1:17:37] all right everybody with me
[1:17:39] so there's that Parable then let's look
[1:17:41] for a second of this horse forehead
[1:17:43] because I want you to understand there
[1:17:44] was a question about this it does sound
[1:17:46] awful and it is awful God hates it
[1:17:50] there's a lot of things God Haze you
[1:17:51] know that look it up in the Bible God
[1:17:53] hates a lot of things
[1:17:57] so when Jeremiah talks about therefore
[1:17:59] the showers have been withholden and it
[1:18:02] has been a lot of rain in other words
[1:18:04] no Harvest rain
[1:18:06] seed's been planted
[1:18:08] but it was wrong
[1:18:10] timing
[1:18:11] and thou Hast the horse forehead thou
[1:18:13] refuses to be a shame
[1:18:15] now that word means highly fed and
[1:18:19] therefore want and in other words to
[1:18:21] commit fornication be a harlot to be
[1:18:23] unfaithful to God
[1:18:26] because he told Israel one time he said
[1:18:29] you've went whoring
[1:18:30] and I had to put you away what were they
[1:18:32] doing they were sacrificing to other
[1:18:34] idols
[1:18:35] are you sacrificing today to other idols
[1:18:39] to something that's keeping you out of
[1:18:41] church something that's keeping you away
[1:18:42] from The Fellowship Of God
[1:18:45] with God and with his people
[1:18:48] all right to play the Harlot to cause
[1:18:51] the commit adulterer to adultery or to
[1:18:53] commit fornication but I like that one
[1:18:55] said highly fed that means man just get
[1:18:58] just give me all the worlds you can give
[1:19:00] me I can't control myself
[1:19:04] because that's what a does a
[1:19:06] can't can't keep theirself
[1:19:08] all right everybody with me
[1:19:10] but God said they have a horse forehead
[1:19:14] from an unused root word man to be clear
[1:19:16] or conspicuous which is the brow or the
[1:19:18] forehead so so you've got unclean and
[1:19:21] then you've got what you've it's at the
[1:19:22] Forefront
[1:19:24] some of us have real prominent foreheads
[1:19:28] remember a collie
[1:19:30] some of y'all
[1:19:32] but you you see that though I can look
[1:19:34] back here and I see your forehead
[1:19:36] so what's happening in the in the
[1:19:39] religious Realm
[1:19:40] a horse forehead is is something that's
[1:19:43] being shown that they don't care whether
[1:19:45] they show it or not
[1:19:47] that's why this is the ungodly group we
[1:19:50] are The Godly group because we don't
[1:19:51] have a horse forehead
[1:19:53] we are we are keeping ourself in the
[1:19:56] word of God we are not one time we are
[1:19:59] not uh highly fed except for the word of
[1:20:02] God we're not highly fed in the world
[1:20:05] so this is a this is a um a definition
[1:20:08] brother Brown doesn't say anything about
[1:20:09] horse forehead I think he makes a
[1:20:11] comment about it one time or reads it
[1:20:12] one time but this is used in the Bible
[1:20:14] as an analogy for a person or a group
[1:20:16] now if this doesn't cover the Church of
[1:20:19] the day I don't know what does our
[1:20:21] church who has broken all meaning of
[1:20:23] integrity now the church
[1:20:25] has broken all meaning of integrity so
[1:20:28] severely they no longer recognize the
[1:20:30] damage of the evil of their actions
[1:20:33] women come to church with their hair cut
[1:20:34] they come to church with pants on they
[1:20:36] just come to church anyway you know what
[1:20:38] I mean the big thing is Come As You Are
[1:20:41] I believe that
[1:20:43] but if you come as you are you won't go
[1:20:45] away as you came
[1:20:46] if you really get something you will not
[1:20:48] go away as you came if you get something
[1:20:51] I can't agree with that come as you are
[1:20:54] come on Cindy came sister came for two
[1:20:57] three months and then nobody had to
[1:20:59] blast her over the head about it she
[1:21:01] quit wearing earrings she quit wearing
[1:21:03] makeup she quit wearing pants
[1:21:06] dad just sat there and preached the word
[1:21:07] of God
[1:21:09] and just remind them that it's in the
[1:21:10] Bible and you remind you know all this
[1:21:12] all these things and you let them do it
[1:21:14] their own self
[1:21:16] that's better than having to be a slave
[1:21:18] to do it all right it is a relevant term
[1:21:20] today describing how the average
[1:21:22] person's sense of right or wrong has
[1:21:24] been warped from its natural we're not
[1:21:25] living in that world
[1:21:27] shooting on every hand transgender I I
[1:21:31] love this guy his license he's not back
[1:21:34] but it's something else they were
[1:21:36] challenging him a transgender was
[1:21:38] challenging him on something about male
[1:21:40] and female
[1:21:42] he said I just want to ask one question
[1:21:44] he said how many of you that was born a
[1:21:48] man
[1:21:49] have ever given birth
[1:21:53] can't happen
[1:21:54] won't happen won't ever happen
[1:21:59] so that person you know goes off on his
[1:22:01] face and answer my question how many men
[1:22:04] in the Dawn and history of time he said
[1:22:06] all the way from recorded history how
[1:22:08] many people that were born men
[1:22:12] all right has had a baby
[1:22:16] well well none well okay then we know
[1:22:19] there's a separation between a male and
[1:22:21] a female
[1:22:22] hello somebody I mean see look back to
[1:22:24] the world it's become now the natural
[1:22:26] thing to be whatever you want to be not
[1:22:29] here
[1:22:31] we have godliness
[1:22:33] now they're bringing it into churches
[1:22:35] the Methodist Church allowing every bit
[1:22:37] of that
[1:22:38] parts of the Methodist church thank God
[1:22:40] there's a part of the church that's
[1:22:41] standing up says no
[1:22:46] our neighbor he said I'm not listening
[1:22:48] to a gay woman tell me about God
[1:22:51] is it okay
[1:22:53] because he's a Methodist
[1:22:55] but you see how that see we don't debate
[1:22:57] that here
[1:22:59] that's never a debate
[1:23:01] we don't debate clothes we don't have we
[1:23:04] don't debate whether it's father son
[1:23:06] holy ghost or Lord Jesus Christ do we we
[1:23:08] don't do debate those things in here
[1:23:10] we don't debate
[1:23:14] debate there's no difference
[1:23:21] great is the mystery of godliness
[1:23:24] because he come into me and you
[1:23:26] told us how to live
[1:23:29] what the bible really says
[1:23:32] or in other words what it means
[1:23:34] straight from the mind of God
[1:23:37] people in the world they got their own
[1:23:39] work sense this has led to the
[1:23:41] destruction of marriage massive numbers
[1:23:43] of fatherless homes and bastard births
[1:23:45] I'm sorry it is nothing now for a woman
[1:23:48] to get pregnant out of wedlock it's
[1:23:50] nothing
[1:23:50] it's just wide open
[1:23:57] sorry
[1:23:59] 30 percent to Upward of 80 percent
[1:24:01] illegitimacy rate in some groups
[1:24:04] now in the Old Testament if you were
[1:24:06] born a bastard child you didn't you and
[1:24:08] your family you and whoever was didn't
[1:24:10] go in the congregation for 400 years
[1:24:13] 400 years you were
[1:24:16] barred from going to church
[1:24:18] wow and We Know listen we've done been
[1:24:21] through this so the blood of Jesus

[1:24:40] that
[1:24:41] because humanly it bothers us but but
[1:24:43] you're not going to hear from this
[1:24:45] pulpit and from the pulpit of the
[1:24:47] message of the hour that you're going to
[1:24:49] hell because you're a bastard child and

[1:25:06] them gone well that's not that's greasy

[1:25:11] open and increase sexual perversion
[1:25:13] homosexuality pedophilia transvestite
[1:25:15] bestality pornography adultery
[1:25:18] prostitution and the sexualization of
[1:25:20] young children especially girls have we
[1:25:22] not seen that
[1:25:23] that's a forehead that's that's
[1:25:25] become accepted practice now when I was
[1:25:27] growing up it wasn't if a girl got
[1:25:29] pregnant when I was growing up she
[1:25:30] disappeared for a little while anybody
[1:25:33] with me
[1:25:34] now
[1:25:37] who's the daddy I don't know
[1:25:41] these passages all have a similar
[1:25:43] context they were written just prior to
[1:25:45] the fall and scattering of either Israel
[1:25:47] to the north of Judah to the South each
[1:25:50] shows a wealthy people unblinkingly
[1:25:52] focused on their pleasure is that not
[1:25:54] the United States of stinking America
[1:25:58] giving no thought to God listen we
[1:26:01] raised to that ceiling just so we could
[1:26:03] stay in debt
[1:26:04] how's that fit brother John how's that
[1:26:07] feel we raise the debt ceiling so we can
[1:26:10] borrow more our credit card went to 70
[1:26:12] trillion instead of 40 trillion
[1:26:16] there's got to be a day that that's
[1:26:18] going to fall
[1:26:20] but they unblinkingly focus on Pleasure
[1:26:23] giving no thought to God they're
[1:26:25] casually uninterested in the moral
[1:26:27] welfare welfare of their Nation
[1:26:29] that is crashing into utter depravity
[1:26:33] shame for sin has disappeared
[1:26:36] amen
[1:26:37] the interpreters commentary the Bible
[1:26:39] states that the Bible shows that in a
[1:26:41] period before Nations fell their
[1:26:43] societies show significant breakdowns in
[1:26:46] two areas political and business hello
[1:26:48] somebody and in family life with
[1:26:52] specific blame falling on women
[1:26:56] churches
[1:26:57] women are churches
[1:26:59] brother Brown said the weakness is what
[1:27:01] pulpep he said uh not it's not of
[1:27:05] children or juvenile delinquency is what
[1:27:07] parental delinquency
[1:27:09] and these passages the Fallen
[1:27:11] characteristics are either directly
[1:27:12] named or strongly implied Rebellion
[1:27:14] obstinacy betrayal distrust
[1:27:16] shamelessness and greed now I hope we
[1:27:19] don't have that problem here
[1:27:21] an audacious self-centeredness against
[1:27:23] God and fellow man we're going to talk
[1:27:25] about selfishness this afternoon
[1:27:27] these are not the characteristics of a
[1:27:29] nation that would bring honor to God at
[1:27:32] one time in the history of this nation
[1:27:33] the overwhelming majority of people
[1:27:35] expressed a strong sense of Shame when
[1:27:37] they sinned Shane was an ugly thing and
[1:27:39] due to these sense of Shame they did
[1:27:41] whatever they could to hide their moral
[1:27:43] flaws from others
[1:27:45] but today the horse forehead is all
[1:27:47] painted right here
[1:27:49] look at me
[1:27:53] some of that still exists the period of
[1:27:55] late 1950s and 60s was probably the
[1:27:57] beginning of the end of that attitude
[1:27:58] sin has gradually carried less of a
[1:28:01] stigma and the sense of Shame has been
[1:28:04] slowly replaced by a growing boldness of
[1:28:06] attitude
[1:28:10] a flocking of sin much of that sense of
[1:28:14] Shame has disappeared from the American
[1:28:16] psyche some remains in a small
[1:28:18] percentage of the population thank God
[1:28:22] that's why we living
[1:28:24] God garlic territory
[1:28:27] but we'll
[1:28:28] subcute him because if we stand here
[1:28:30] against that
[1:28:31] they're going to persecute us
[1:28:35] yet increasingly bold immorality has
[1:28:38] become the way of life so that sin is
[1:28:39] now blatantly committed civility is
[1:28:42] becoming a thing of the past rudeness
[1:28:44] and open Brazen misconduct is becoming
[1:28:46] the normal way of doing things
[1:28:48] if this is not the world come on
[1:28:51] that's what the conduct of a horse
[1:28:53] forehead pictures it represents the
[1:28:55] blatant audacious sin of the
[1:28:57] streetwalker who is out in public openly
[1:29:00] displaying what she is promoting herself
[1:29:02] and tempting others to engage in sin
[1:29:05] with her
[1:29:06] wow
[1:29:08] I've had enough of that let's talk about
[1:29:10] godliness for a second I had enough of
[1:29:12] that
[1:29:15] so here's that group over here
[1:29:18] and listen folks you may think that's
[1:29:21] that that's you know we say we got the
[1:29:24] the world that don't care about God we
[1:29:26] got the world that thinks a little bit
[1:29:28] about God
[1:29:29] the world that goes to church under
[1:29:30] their denominance denominational idea
[1:29:32] and then you got the bride
[1:29:34] well every bit of that is from us now
[1:29:40] that's for most down
[1:29:43] I'm saying us too because we let a lot
[1:29:45] of stuff creep in Houston not creep in
[1:29:46] churches in the message either
[1:29:48] oh don't say now brother wait now you
[1:29:51] did good till you put us in that in that
[1:29:53] room
[1:29:54] yeah
[1:29:56] well you just look around
[1:29:59] takes a lot of things goes on in the
[1:30:00] church that and this one and others not
[1:30:03] just this one that that you know 40
[1:30:05] years ago wouldn't happen
[1:30:09] why
[1:30:13] because it's right you know what you see
[1:30:15] it you look around
[1:30:18] a deity is a supernatural the shaping of
[1:30:20] Western Christianity well let's get to
[1:30:22] deity for just a second then we'll close
[1:30:24] it was coined by Saint Augustine the
[1:30:26] Theologian whose writings were very
[1:30:27] influential in the shaping of the
[1:30:29] western Christianity deity comes from
[1:30:31] the Latin word for God Dias the divine
[1:30:34] nature of deities is believed to be
[1:30:36] immortal goodness and powerfulness or
[1:30:38] any supernatural being brother Ram tells
[1:30:40] us right here
[1:30:43] and he swore by himself in 1954.
[1:30:46] he said let's just read the red in it
[1:30:48] the same life that was in the corn down
[1:30:50] here at the first talk is in it up here
[1:30:52] in the ear of the grain just the same
[1:30:54] the same God within the pill of fire was
[1:30:56] in Christ Jesus all right hold on the
[1:30:58] same one in Christ Jesus and you
[1:31:02] that's right God in you the hope of
[1:31:04] glory is that right the baptism of the
[1:31:06] Holy Spirit dwelling in the person now
[1:31:09] you become what sons of God no wonder he
[1:31:12] believes in the Supernatural no wonder
[1:31:14] he believes in anything why is it in him
[1:31:16] as a portion of God
[1:31:18] wow wrapped up in that mortal body
[1:31:23] where there's sin and everything else
[1:31:25] has created this body but down in there
[1:31:29] some work of God Alone in regeneration
[1:31:32] somehow he come down through all that
[1:31:35] mess and save yourself
[1:31:38] has come down through there by the
[1:31:40] shedding of his own blood taking away
[1:31:42] that blood that was in there as a way
[1:31:44] and set it aside and entered into this
[1:31:47] sinful man and put him in a hope that
[1:31:50] he'd die for it just as freely
[1:31:52] as he'd stand there now what's he saying
[1:31:54] in in simple terms
[1:31:57] you still got your old stinking blood
[1:31:59] because you were born in sin shaping a
[1:32:01] nickel you came from your daddy's sperm
[1:32:03] and your mama would give you the body
[1:32:04] right everybody with me and that's
[1:32:06] inside of you and that that you know the
[1:32:08] song his royal blood flows through my
[1:32:10] veins and not happening right now
[1:32:13] but by what representation of his blood
[1:32:16] last brother Ryan talks about a blood
[1:32:17] transfusion but he said right here see I
[1:32:20] like what he said and set it aside
[1:32:22] he shed his own blood and taken away
[1:32:25] that blood that was in there not taking
[1:32:27] your blood all the way out
[1:32:29] but as a way and set it aside and
[1:32:32] entered into this sinful man and put him
[1:32:35] in a hope that he'd die let's stand to
[1:32:36] her feet we'll stop right there we'll
[1:32:38] finish this afternoon
[1:32:39] we didn't even get the godliness much
[1:32:44] musicians come let's sing a song
[1:32:49] but we got to believe that we're not
[1:32:50] just
[1:32:52] another
[1:32:53] part of God in another situation or
[1:32:56] another separation we are God made
[1:32:58] manifest in another form called bride
[1:33:02] right so right here brother Brown said
[1:33:03] he's just a portion of God
[1:33:06] now remember we're not all of God
[1:33:11] Jesus Christ was all of God we're not
[1:33:13] all of God
[1:33:14] we're part of God but you know what a
[1:33:17] part of God is all of God
[1:33:19] you take the spoon
[1:33:21] go dip it in the ocean
[1:33:23] come out put it under a microscope you
[1:33:26] look then you take the microscope if you
[1:33:28] could and go out in the four-fifths of
[1:33:29] the of the world is made out of ocean
[1:33:31] water and if you were to put the
[1:33:33] microscope down over that and and
[1:33:35] magnify it it's the same thing
[1:33:40] it's just this is important
[1:33:42] you can't drown in this you can drown in
[1:33:44] this
[1:33:45] you can't swim in this you can swim in
[1:33:47] this you can't put a boat in this you
[1:33:48] can put a boat in this and Jesus you put
[1:33:50] all the boat
[1:33:51] he was the fullness of the godhead
[1:33:53] bodily but you and I collectively though
[1:33:56] will become and are becoming the
[1:33:58] fullness of the godhead bodily in the
[1:34:00] end time that's a promise that God gave
[1:34:02] us through a prophet that we would be
[1:34:04] that headstone in a Army of people the
[1:34:09] bride in the end time and we will
[1:34:13] defeat Satan a portion of that deity
[1:34:16] dwells in the heart of every born-again
[1:34:18] Christian
[1:34:19] Hallelujah that's what you will it'll be
[1:34:22] given to you if you need something
[1:34:24] there's your promise let's sing a song
