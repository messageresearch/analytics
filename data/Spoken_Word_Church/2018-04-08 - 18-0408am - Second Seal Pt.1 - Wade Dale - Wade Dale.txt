Description:
MATTHEW 12:43-45
»     43     †     When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.
»     44     †     Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.
»     45     †     Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.

5) 62-1231   THE CONTEST   JEFFERSONVILLE IN     MONDAY_      64
31       †          How I would like to stand here now and lay onto that, go back through the Bible and show you a man back there who come face to face with. How in the contest against the enemy, they fortified themselves by the Word of God. Noah had an experience of it, and he knew that God told him it was going to rain. And the contest was on between science and the Word of God: Science says, "It can't happen." God said, "It will happen." Amen.

32    That same thing exists today. It will happen! It does happen! There is devils! But Jesus cast them out, and He gave His Church authority to do so, "Cast out devils in My Name!" He cast seven devils out of a pretty woman one day. And He said, "When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walks in dry places, returning back then, bringing seven other devils with him." Now, that goes to show that if the man was cleaned of devils, there was something was in him had gone out. A devil had gone out! Now, when the devil moved out, that God... gives God an opportunity to move in. So, and when he goes out, let the Holy Spirit come in. Don't just leave it there. If you do just repent of your sins and go on, then you're going to be worse off than ever. But get that place where Satan once lived and occupied, get it filled with the Holy Spirit of God, and then you'll have the strength of God's Word in you, manifested, and cast o...

it becomes a god you'll be blessed hey ma'am come to hear from him good to be in the house of Lord good to have everybody back couldn't have brother down sister Nell back in and Richard Joe Rachel Bob Monica we had all these people out a couple of weeks so good to have them all back couldn't have them all arrested I guess that wasn't much of a name man but I guess they probably need another week off to rest for the week they took off right they never wear that happens on a vacation you take a vacation need take a few days off after the vacation or you think you need it so but good to be announced of the Lord if you got your Bibles let's turn now to the Book of Revelations what we're going to do today is we got to services so we don't take our time hey man that all right and we will enter into the second seal today we're going to review a little bit with the first and then we'll enter back into the go into the second seal but go back into the first just for a few minutes polish up some things that we that we saw again last night while we were yesterday while we're students so don't you pray for me the devil trying to give me the cred so I'm boot him enough so y'all believe blew them too so but I may have to do the estimate do that but that's okay we're still in these human bodies but that's alright we're going to persevere good to have that group last night the Bible study man that was probably half the church they're almost of a failed to build the building up so those you that missed it well you missed it it's your fault what did you do what did you do oh we sat and watched service we watched online no well forget it whatever Bible study we had a good time though we had a real good time Bible study brother Louisa's message Wednesday night if y'all didn't hear it you need to hear it and you know what that calls to Louie's Thursday morning there was a 5.3 earthquake call for the coast of California one strongest one that had in that a long time and it was off the coast right at Los Angeles getting close people we can we can we can make excuses if we want to but there's only one shelter that's in the Word of God we can take everything else we want to take and go wherever we want to go but the Word of God is what's going to keep us that's thinking yesterday you know they if you got a cell phone in your pocket they can find you so that's the GPS so and you got one in your car now everybody this kind of new cars go to GPS well guess what the government can listen in the government or whoever it is we take the government but whoever it is can listen in so it's only good it's only going to be God when that third pull is going that will be just for a group of people that trust in God and no one else amen and if you'll catch it like brother Brown said if you'll catch it we are speaking on the third pole because like I was talking about the clock last night and about his wife but we were talking about the the message and he said his church he just got so cold and I said well most of ours is too just cold cold too formal we we call it a church that's what they called it in Rome a church I thought it wasn't a church I thought was people amen are you people growing not my church is growing by numbers well what does that matter but as your people growing and your people growing your people is what it is will the third pole who is it - to the bride to the church and to the totally lost who will never know what's going on and they're sitting right around it hey man so just when you give you that little tidbit of information there because we from that message Wednesday night we need to wake up we we are complacent and all of us are and we do things that we shouldn't do and and that's why we're going through these seals it talks about a nick word in it talks about sin and transgression and all these things where we're trying to sharpen it out but brother Clark now we're talking you know we we are the cleanest people on the face of the earth now we are the cleanest living people on the face of the earth be denominations don't care about marriage and divorce they married divorce ten times 20 times they don't matter you know they have they have many meetings for divorced couples well that don't fly on the message folks we we don't have he had he had somebody call him and said should I divorce my wife brother closet unless she's committing fornication UK divorce her period what do you want to discuss this about there's no divorce in this message we don't have counsel for divorce in the met why because we're supposed to be set aside and kept clean because we had a prophet come told us the truth whether you believe it or not he told us the truth and the truth what's gonna set you free not some man's idea it's not some discussion that we have but that's what we're when brother Brown got on these seals he said you said you people realize this is that third pull in other words it cannot be imitated so we know one thing for sure the denominations can't imitate us they're so far away we will read it now where we've come up now to the fourth age and he said y'all have suffered that woman Jezebel nobody let me tell you something Jezebel's come back in the church Jezebel has come back in the church you said no she's in that church well no she's in this church because it's the devil that ain't Jezebel it's the devil that's trying to what divide and conquer that's why you see the Pope divide and conquer that's not victory that's divide and conquer he wants to divide and conquer this place so to go to Revelation six we're gonna read 1 through 4 and just take her time today if that's all right man won't be little B in no hurry I've got enough note something you just got notes there'll be some inserts but you'll use it for this afternoon so just keep it in your seat or bring it back with you revelation 6 one through two how many one through four unless by our heads definitely father we pray Lord today that you would be the active participant in this service you do the speaking you do the hearing only you can give her ever landlords will drop down that 12 inches from the brain to the heart not the thumping part of man but the very heart the very soul of the individual today and shake us Lord stir us that we watch and wait and see that your coming is drawing nigh and that you will come and get a group of people there nothing you're not going to just come and get us because we say we're bright you're gonna come and get us because we are bright and we act like bright and we do the things that the bride does we think the things that the bride things father we thank you for these things Lord that you've brought to us in this endtime no one else since the dawn of time has been able to open this book and be able to see the things that we see and we should be happy for that Lord thank you for this day forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes that we make Lord bless the missionaries on the foreign fields give them fruit for their labor bless the ones that are not here that are sick the ones that are not with us Lord today we pray that you would just go to them and strengthen their body Lord save the Lost heal the sick father in the name of Jesus Christ amen he's still a sin killing God and man and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard it was the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and I saw him behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer now that's what we've been on now we're gonna get ready to enter into the second seal after we do just a little bit of background and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see no thunder go straight into there straight into the scene like we were talking about last night John wrote a scene he wrote what he saw no interpretation he wrote what he saw and there went out another horse and that was another horse but the same rider and then another horse or another power but the same rider and power was given to him that sat thereon that said on the horse to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword and we know what a sword is it's a word the man you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing for the reading of the word now before we get into the second seal I was reminded to go back and review just a few minutes and I believe we will since we have a little time and review and read some of the things I forgot my chart I'd be right back love the Lord he's good to uh Sidney st. and trying to keep try to hinder us and kill us everywhere you can right a man does pretty good job sometimes but you know what the Bible says like we come back he that overcometh it's not he that codes of the Hinton's not to he that he that goes to the cushy birthday party no is he that has been through a battle they'll be battle-scarred veterans they're not people that didn't have to do anything amen I believe that I believe it'll be I believe it'll be battle-scarred veterans it'll be people this went through a battle and you'll know it too hey man don't you go through a battle already maybe we go through a battle already so all right we're gonna cover now the first two ages I mean first two seals and we know that all this other happens okay but we'll get to that in a minute all right if I witness a man all right first seal covers what the first three ages and we've got this as a lap over because we're going to look today that this church age this church age here ended in like 606 which is kind of weird that was a nice scene council all right but what happened was Constantine was back during that time too so what happened with Constantine he's bringing what church and state together so but we'll get into that in just a second let's pull up the first we want to see this as we've always looked Redemption Redemption we got to see the word Redemption don't forget that word we've we have been we have been lost and we are now able to be redeemable because of the new birth in our soul we come to a place where we can be we're already redeemed in the soul but we can take this body own to redemption amen those who he's justified he's already glorified all right so we'll that'll strike you one of these days the breaking of the seals is not necessarily for the soul I keep saying that because the blood of Jesus Christ it's what saves your soul that's what cleans your soul out hey man you go through justification which got chopped off your past sins he won't dwell with an unclean vessel sanctification unclean spirit goes out but we'll read it again a minute but unclean spirit goes out and sanctification amen so there must have been something unclean in you to start with we weren't so holy in past Paul had something unclean in him that's why I God had to knock him down get his attention but Paul had to go see somebody that was already in the body hey man because the seed comes to the body the what the word Ananias was in the word Paul thought he was in the word he was in the word of a past day Martin Luther's justification only gets you in one step today it put him in the body so when God moved on God moved on through the Old Testament Paul thought he was okay he was what persecuting Christians Brian persecute Brian was Paul bribed in God's mind absolutely Paul always was bribed but down here on the earth he was not right he was a sinner dead a dead center until God struck him down amen could you just stop for all these scriptures out there why did it wise the unclean spirit a lot of a man if it's not in you the Bible says the unclean spirit goes out of a man so it had to be there that older Demick nature everybody was born under everybody was born in saying shaping iniquity come to this world speaking live and see to me that way I can I can see that the blood of Jesus Christ saved my soul but then there's another part of this though I want more fellowship with God I want more manifestations in my life God said okay you got to do this you got to go up that statue of a perfect man that's why that the the first the faith of the fathers is we were talking about last night the faith of the fathers had these virtues working in their life Peter couldn't put it in the Bible if he had to live through it hey man Peter couldn't just start right well add to your faith virtue divert no Peter by all means Peter had some temper he knew God was working on that man and then even jesus said Peter I'm praying for you Satan is sifting you you know why cuz he was just like Paul Paul was one of Satan's best employees Paul was he was persecuting Christians he said himself in the Bible says I caused them to blaspheme I caused them what I Paul so you and I did the same thing you said no I didn't persecute the church you persecute Christianity by not being one why didn't I come to church when I was a sinner cuz I wasn't a Christian hey man I wanted to do what did ever want me to do you didn't oh well you must have been born in a bubble because I was like Paul I prefer to get employee but when God saved my soul he saved my soul I don't know about yours he saved my soul he burnt that old nature I was born with completely out and put himself in there hey man I responded to the word that before the foundation of the world God wrote this Bible amen God wrote the Bible before the foundation of the world knowing you would respond to a certain part of that scripture ethiopian eunuch reading the Old Testament who is this man talking about yeah his self or another right God just trench transporting Philip over Philip says let me tell you about this guy right you know why because the word had come alive in Philips heart it wasn't a hearsay hearsay he had experienced that come on so he could tell the Ethiopian eunuch and you know what listen I'm sorry but Philip was a little complacent he said I'm leaving I'll see you bye and if you'll be innocent I raised water right here some sparked in my lap you gonna baptize me before you leave remember fella was getting ready ladies okay I'm done think they'll be innocent oh no I don't think so while you here you gonna baptize me cuz you've shown me something I don't know where that comes from but that's good enough yeah come summer winds you're not still up here I'm rubbing all over the week but we're looking at full fellowship now though we are we have come to a place in the end time to where that garden like I said about the Thunder the Turner's the voice of God God come down into this dimension with a thunderbolt lightning come in and finally he says I'm here and now I got a group of people that'll really understand what I'm saying that don't excite you where'd it come from that don't excite you he should the end of the earth has come upon you and I but we've been equipped with more words than anybody in the whole time since the beginning of time how to handle this thing we have Satan's answer Sadie's answer is devil I know you used to be my friend I know that I have no you know iniquity is what iniquity is to say no he ain't in me I always was this great thing no you wouldn't you were lost why the Prophet have to go in the Pigpen and get holy go but if it's good enough for him was good enough for me but then the Prophet came and that's what he said yeah - sure he was born a prophet he had an anointing but he needed the Holy Ghost do you remember what he said he said I used to wash my car on Sunday now wait a minute I used to wash my car washed it watching people go to church did not what he said he'd go to church why he was a sinner he told you he was a sinner so what happens you say well why are you harping on this my salvation is the greatest thing than the greater than this world being made but there's more that just gets the baby here that just gets the baby out of the womb and then the baby starts to living in the finally the baby comes to a place to where he says I want to know more I like this milk but now I want to sandwich one my milk then I wanna oh that's a steak I think I want some of that too and there's some chicken where's jewel Forney when you need him there chicken hey listen chicken excites jewel for anyone cuz he likes chicken the Word of God ought excite you they see the you like it or you know but brings full fellowship in the manifestation so even down to all these church ages there was not full fellowship and then remember the Bible brother I mean census we says come out of her my people he said they couldn't get all the way out why they didn't have enough word to get out on Luther had just enough to get born again amen but that's why they were last night does the faith of the fathers brings us back not to full fellowship but it brings us back to a fellowship with God that no one else had but that really just gets you in tune which is the body to get you in tune with the head and the head stone coming was the opening of those seals and we'll read up here in just a little while look at number one but you have to get you know you have to get your days together and you have to get your time you have to see that that's the hand of God's and everything they man the hand of gods and everything we do but look see what it's doing is these seals opening up just begin to reveal the plan of redemption how we did it it's all over now just about just about finishing up so we're at the end time so that's why the things are being revealed there by all right with that say man now this when I read way back when we did the foundation and brother Lewis sent it to us yesterday and I want to read it again let's pull number two up this is in the breeze now when we go to break in these seals you going to see it goes plumb back in the scripture all the way back once you talk about back to Genesis alright back to Genesis alright the Bible don't go further in Genesis go Genesis did God created heaven the earth and the stars and the moons and all out okay all right that's when what that's when the thought of God was expressed just telling you what the Bible says it's the thoughts of God expressed the same with you you were thought in God's mind but listen it's like brother Dale always said and he didn't cover it last night I want him to say it so bad Judas was thought of God Hitler was thought of God but to be part of the one doing the thinking to be to be not a second person a man but if you're part of the one that wrote the book like brother Ram tops about the symphony all these little things that he tells us we're not just to fill up tape space amen because to get into with the conductor you can lead whatever you want to lead same way with the Bible if the one that wrote the Bible is inside me guess what there is no way I now I personally can hinder the work of the Holy Ghost a man grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you're sealed grieve not so you can grieve okay but what's inside of me is the word made manifest so I should be able to understand what the word says that's why the Ethiopian eunuch couldn't though he was a but though he was a potential Christian he wasn't Christian the timeyou potential Christian amen there was a seed laying there waiting but he took Philip the one with a live word to come and make that word alive to him I mean people how many of us read the Bible when we were sinners why we think we need it now that's all we feed off of why we found that that's what we come from not a dead letter on the page but the seed word quicken all right look for each one of those seals the whole thing together the whole mystery lays right here in these seals every mystery of the Bible lays in these seals in the seals cannot be broken until that time I'll prove it just admit now he's in the breeze right notice now the book remember is sealed here's one no it's what we're talking about remember before look this is the seal this is not the seal this is what's written this is the seal this is what's got this sealed up so you can't see it is that all right because look I'm gonna read to you right here now but notice the book remember it's sealed here's one here is this seal then another one's round a seal another one's wrapped to seal it's a book of redemption now the whole thing together makes the book and it's sealed with seven seals it's being on the back side is because it's wound around the seal mystery is on the inside and it only says look and it only says the wild horse rider or black horse rider whatever more on the white on the outside right this right here this is the seal but remember the complete plan of redemption is revealed in the seals this is the revelation listen it only took just a little bit of guidance for us to know that the white horse rider was the Antichrist amen I mean that had to break the seal had to come off the prophet had to come and tell us and put us in the right condition but remember everything after that though was what was inside this is the inside of the book alright remember I read the quote to you that it was the thunders and the seals is two different things this is the seal this is the thunder of the voice of God when the seal breaks this is the this is the thunder alright what he had sealed was was wild horse when he had sealed was a Red Horse and I'm gonna prove something to you just second which really came to me yesterday which I really enjoyed but listen I'm sorry I didn't read it on our black horse and whatever more on the outside but the mystery of the whole book is in themselves from Genesis to revelations a complete plan of what redemption is revealed in those seven seals and it's an important time God helps us to get it god help us to get it now because what did the seals do the seal showed your complete Redemption Israel's complete redemption amen the world's complete redemption and the defeat of Satan now what more do you want now he's defeated in your soul but I won't just got change amen that's what I want I don't know about you but that's what I want I want this guy changed amen cuz watch you think well now boy Roman isn't paganism all started right here in this angle man hang on man you know whether the deception really started now not yeah in the Garden of Eden but I mean when it comes down to earth right here to where we can see what it started from now we know it started as a deed went to a doctrine we know it started as a baby form and then he kept coming up we know it started as a wild horse rider what was the first deception under Romanism because remember Romanism brother Brown said you know don't worry about communism he said you better worry about Romanism amen watch what did they steal that tomb of Jesus is with a Roman seal he said what's that got to do anything when Jesus resurrected the first thing they said was he didn't say he's risen they said somebody stole his body when that Roman seal was broken ISM come out with a lot and told all the people in their part that hey they stole his body and they paid somebody to say that same thing today that Roman seal it's still here today they stole his body he didn't resurrect in there right so he carried right on in that demon just kept right going and he kind of hid a little bit in the first ages but he popped his head back up right here he said now he's he's not dead now he's a second person of a Trinity right that's what they said all Romanism amen I thought that was pretty good it was a Roman seal a Roman lie they started the whole thing off I said start the whole thing off and then but going back on was what it was that pure Church in the first stage that white righteous Church that was the real white righteous was on the earth´s at the time that's why Satan got on his white horse and attached himself to that same church and rode right down through there telling the people Jesus wasn't gone he couldn't have been that's what he says Suren theist there in the arena this time that Jesus was not gone until the River Jordan select doctrines old real old man real old I mean two thousand years old what it's done it's raised his head to see who agree with it then what happens is as you they push you back down well then all of a sudden he finds a weak spot he jumps right back up and then he goes down he jumps right back up same devil same thing with Hitler listen the the spirit that was on Hitler to kill the Jews it's the same spirit that was on Haman amen in the book of Esther Haman wanted all the Jews killed and what happened the great thing is the type of us is that is that when Esther went to the king and he said well now I can't change my word because you can read that Bible they'll judge and condemn you but I'm going to give but she said well what about this if you can't change it then give them something to defend herself with so you know what he did he said I'm going to tell them the very day it's going to happen and that they can take up arms and defend themselves and what did they do they destroyed Haman's army because they knew what was coming in at the same thing what the holy ghost does with you and I he's give us that power to know what the Devils doing to know what he's going to do thirty years from now if we'll just listen and then so let's review for a minute the white horse remember the wild horse was a white righteous Church Satan was a bluff and he went forth conquering in to conquer all right so we know that that was typed in the first three Church ages with a little bit of lap over amen like what we was talking about all right now let's some of you that have this sheet of paper you'll need to add the sheet that temps gave you later I added these quotes in so let's pull this one up right here and let's see we're going to we're going to finish a little bit of this because I'm still reviewing and I missed this and I want to go back to it because I think it's really important to see we've mentioned it before but now since today we got a little time we'll come back and review it because remember this is the book of redemption right this is the plan of redemption for us for Israel Jews you can call them whatever you want to call them I don't care I ain't gonna fight over why you call them people it's 144,000 that's going to be saved and a fifth seal Jew that's gonna be given eternal life so what you call them whatever you want I really don't care I really don't I'm worried about me I'm a Gentile whatever happens to them God's already done it for sealed side delivered you know what they're doing they're waiting on us to get out of the way so that's what we're trying to do we're fighting trying to get out of the way now let's get our sword out again now the word because remember we're heading toward the second seal where God get actually gave Satan a sword we'll read it in a minute and I appreciate brother Neville spiritual support as well as the brotherly love back here behind me praying for me you all out there now tonight being Friday night we'll just make it as you can't possibly hit all the things if you cause you to take that just one of those seals and stay just bring it right through the scripture right down see it takes months and months and months and you still wouldn't have it because the seal itself times the entire scripture from Genesis to Revelation one seal will try the entire Bible together why because it's the plan of redemption this Bible is the complete plan of redemption us the Jews the world and a defeat of Satan just like I said before all right so let's go to the next one this is the second one we added in six seal doesn't want you to see something then we're going to parallel here because I didn't do it in the first seal now the earthquake let's compare scripture this is the sixth seal if you got pencil on paper with you I want you to do something for me if you want to write write this because unless you're going to take the tape now I want you to read with me as you do compare scriptures of this great event that we will see that this great secret or mystery that was under the sixth seal of the book of redemption he's talking about 16 right now remember these are hidden mysteries and the sixth seals altogether is one great big book now you say oh brother around there seven seals now remember six seals is always wrote there is nothing wrote in the seventh seal except silence and brother branham he told us Christ is the seal Amen so Christ is not just in the book he is the book hey man and the six seals all together is one great big book just six Scrolls rolled together and unwinds the whole book of redemption that's how the whole earth was redeemed so six seals finishes Redemption remember brother emphasis six-foot sea not totally the quote but I'll read it later on six seals finishes finishing it and then the seventh seal brings Christ back to earth that's what he said in the seventh seal right so Christ is the seal redemption is over once that seeks hell breaks to you redemption is over because really the seventh seal guy Jesus Christ meets you on the opening in the first seal because he's the one with a book in his hand and man Jesus Christ is the one with a book in his end of the first Dale got it say man so now look if six sales finishes redemption for us then we've got to walk this thing through and I want to show you how to parallelize the six fold purpose of Daniel seventy weeks all right that Alright say ma'am because remember Daniel 9:24 says what let's read it seventy weeks are determined what thy people and the city member we went through dang of 70 weeks long time it's to two things the people and the city to do how many things six one finish transgression to make an end of sin three mate reconciliation for iniquity for bringing everlasting righteousness five seal up the vision and prophecy and six to north among holy there's your six fold purpose finishes Israel's Redemption and then there's no seventh in there was it because the seventh is on the scene at the time amen amen the seventh seal is on the scene at the time brother brown said ten one Christ one coming down being here because he's only one can open the seal but there's only six written seals there's only six full purpose of the redemption of Israel because you know as well as I do Daniel not damaged the Book of Daniel is the Book of Revelations to the Jews amen just like the Book of Revelations this to us that's the book of Revelation to the Jews because it tells them all the three and a half years and tell some all the things they're going to go through plus this right here seventy weeks are determined right then you see that there's three parts right what there's three parts a seven a 62 and the one a man a seven a 62 and the one that makes 69 that's why it doesn't matter to me you can tell me a thousand quotes where brother Brown said there's only three and half years left after the rapture he knows what he's talking about so do we because the Bible says there's one week left after the rapture so I don't have to go nowhere else I don't have to listen no great sermon from somebody else the Bible says there's one week left and when he shall make a covenant will mean for one week who's that he that's the guy we're talking about the devil that started he's not God could brother I'm saying God doesn't break the covenant he shall make a covenant with many for one we and when is that coming up May when we're gone so there's one week last after the rapture to finish the 70 weeks of Daniel to bring in this right here now people is the three-and-a-half holy cities the other three and a half hey man we've been through this all time but that's the great mystery of the people in the message don't see but if you don't get it right how can we bring the seals if you don't get it right you can't so there's one week left after the rapture all the earthly time cause of 60 what 69 weeks are done you read in the Bible hey man 69 weeks for finish there's one week left there's seven years left after the rapture of the church to do what that right there that's what's gonna happen amen cuz luck if it's only three and a half years left after the rapture and in the 70 weeks of Daniel ends after that three and a half year ministry where you'll put all this that's got to come inside there because 70 weeks determines all this right here brother Bob said anoint the most holy was in the moon going in to the Millennium so it's got to be some time left people we know that we've all been through it brother Dale preached this in 1974 it should be just old hat for most of us amen alright so now look so now let's take a look at the six fold purpose let's take the first one now what we were talking at the first seal the first seal was a mystery of iniquity the first seal is under justification hey man we were justified not that you you did it yes you did it but your sins were forgiven your sins were put in the sea of God's forgetfulness now how does God go to redeem Israel they're condemned because what they even said we'll cover it in just a minute what we want we'll wait for next time but remember when they said ladies blood be on us and our children that's the second part that's what we're fixing to talk about cuz we're fixing to talk about red No we're going to a red horse hey man now look to finish the transgression to finish what to finish Israel's transgression just like me and you what is a transgression it's to go against something will you for God's when you as a sinner will you for God when you were a sinner no you weren't I'll just answer it for you no you weren't a transgression against me is to do a wrong to me transgress against you is to do the wrong to you so Israel did a wrong to God but you can say well we were trapped into us we were too so is Israel so was Israel he blinded their eyes he blinded them from going on just so you and I could come in Oh what about justification you were talking buddy now so Israel did it wrong to God and in this 70th week what's going to happen God's going to finish the transgression of Israel finish the transgression we'll be turning away the ungodliness from Jacob what's God going to do he's going to say I don't remember that no more amen because if he remembers that he's got to bring you back up amen same thing with you enough he remembers our sins he's got to bring it back up I love what brother Brown said I read it last night brother Brown said you put that under the blood he said I can't even see it he said if you'll put it on the blood he said not even I with his discernment can bring that out of your life why because God's going to go where'd you get that from because let me tell you something people when brother Branham was discerning that wasn't brother Branham that was the mind of Almighty God a man can't discern that perfect sure we could have feelings and and we could be right some of the time but he never was wrong why because it was God coming down and projecting that image right in front of him that's exactly what happened that wasn't hearsay that comes from the mind of God so that was truly God's speaking to us and he still speaks to us by the interpretation of the word finish the transgression will be turning away the ungodliness from Jacob and then all Israel will be born again amen all of them will receive the Holy Spirit hey man so six full purpose in the six seals hand in handle we'll see it in just two a while there by all rights a man we good with this don't hurt nobody's feeling I'm not here to hurt feelings so now look let's look real quick right here cuz we're not gonna be it is hot see some of y'all Fanning them sweating myself so now let's look now we've come through the first seal the first seal types the first three ages with a lap over because it stops at 6:06 and it's the lion age lion li o n the lion age and then Satan rides right through that and becomes just like we read we're going to read it again maybe this evening maybe this morning revelations to where we saw where those seals went right into those church ages it became a deed sorry it became a saying then I hate and you hate that's what he said I'll reread it I hate it and you hate it by the time they come to the church third church age he said you've accepted it and I still hate it then we don't get to number four where says you now hold the doctrine of Jezebel wow that woman preacher hello now let's read the seal because we're coming right here this is the fourth this is the Ox age that all right lion ox man and Eagle the Ox age is what the burden it was a long church age very long it was from 606 to 1520 so it was you know close to a thousand years in this church age right here so the Ox age had to be a labor a bird bear had to just just barely made it through the age amen and when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see now who's the second beast the Ox all right and there went out another horse that was red and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one of them the most the time when you killed somebody there's blood amen and there was given unto him a great sword or a great word we know that right and now we know that the fourth church age now watch the fourth church age goes in to perk of me in church age ends in 606 kind of strange that there was a nice teen Council in 606 somewhere right in there there was things being changed when 325 there was some things going on but he went from a deed to a doctrine and then when we go from come when we come out of that 606 and go into that for church age it becomes a Jezebel spirit but to have a powerful woman you got to have a powerful woman church to be on the scene he saw all they didn't they both they just bet brother Brown told us and I'll find it I couldn't find it this morning her brother Brown told us that the same anointing that those people in that fourth dimension used to overcome that age you and I use every day to overcome what's going on now so it's pretty pow fool to me you say it looked bad it didn't look bad to me God was on the scene doing what he was supposed to do he said if a corner week goes in the grounds got to go in the ground it's gotta go in the ground but when he comes back up we'll get into that with the other ages so now let's go and let's read revelations - like we did the other day that's all right don't get sleepy on me this morning heavenly days you'll never make it this afternoon people y'all will have to start jogging or something start to quit eating so much candy in the morning I know it hits us all but my lord you don't sleep when you're watching television and watching somebody other than that do you did I say that sorry hey it's whatever you want it's whatever you want if you have to set there with a pen and set that with a straight pin and poke yourself in the rear-end please do somebody might start shouting the truth all right let's go let's let's go to the Ephesian Church agent let's read this and then we'll this is heading us into the second seal you'll get that thought in your mind for this afternoon and then we'll start into the seal itself and read some quotes down through here because I wanted to I told them last night I was looking at this everything's red now we got a red horse a red brother branham even red as red is not good sometimes yeah we'll read it tonight red is not good stoplight warning but he said now when it's the blood-red blood of Jesus Christ he said it's the only thing that matters amen and the only thing they can sanctify you it's what the blood of Christ remember because back in the Old Testament the way they were what brought under that water of separation that's why they're waiting on the red heifer now they know they got to get that red heifer to go back over to Israel and start doing worship animal worship because really remember their Messiah had come yet that's why it's going to be the witnesses are going to come in that temple and they're gonna go why are you doing this that's why that I don't believe brother Brian I don't believe that the United States and Russia is gonna kill the 144,000 the Jew boys I don't mean that wrong I'm talking about the Jew boys that surround a litter nothing are gonna say what what do you mean we spent 2,000 years getting this heifer we spent 2,000 years getting this holy of Holy's back now you tell us that it's no good and they're gonna go yep - witness is gonna say you missed it back - in and you missed it now they're gonna get mad at them and kill them and then because where does all persecution come from within amen and you shall hear of wars this is matthew 24:6 let's read it first you shall have wars and rumors of wars now how many of you have ever seen or heard of a war that wasn't bloody bloodiest time of the world is a war shooting killing you understand the natural part for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet so what's he telling him he said look we've still got some more church ages to go we've still got some more things we got to take care of amen so now we've got get my paper back again here so now we've got a red horse power was given to what take peace and kill and he was given a what a word because remember the Word of God was in power in these church ages we don't have them on here but it's like the we said it looks like somebody laying down but you got a lot of light a little more less a little more less than just a little bit a lot wow that's the Christian the black is what the opposition alright is that Alright so the Word of God was in power but what happens is these these doctrines I read you the quote last Sunday where the Holy Ghost has been bound for 2,000 years right here 2,000 years at the door of Creed's and dogmas right in this message but it's to be loosed by an endtime bride that'll listen to what's going on and listen what to what the Spirit says to the church hey man you got listening to what the Spirit says to the church so he was given a great sword then all right so now let's go to revelations 2 and we started last Sunday I didn't have them bring us up but they can late if they can pull it up where we go thank you until the angel the Church of Ephesus write these things either hold us of seven stars in his right hand the walks in the myth of the seven golden candlesticks I know thy works and thy labour in other words I'm not forgetting you and thy patience and how thou canst not bear them with your evil now look that first church says listen when cilenti us who was Iranian said I don't want to be in the same house right Bob he said I don't want to be caught in the same house with syringe he is preaching that false doctrine quote by Irenaeus yet sometimes they didn't want nothing to do with false doctrine can't spare them which are evil and thou has tried them which say they are apostles and are not and has found them liars that determine in that first tooth one one two three Church ages they discern that spirit and they called it what it was and has born and has patience if far my namesake not father and Holy Ghost baptism for my namesake the Lord Jesus Christ that's the labor that has not fainted nevertheless guess what there's a wild horse rider fixing to ride through amen never the nest Lynn nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent what's the first seal justification chopped off your past sins do the first works perhaps I will come unto thee quickly and remove that that'll stick out of place except thou repent but this thou hast alright this now half now God said now these things I don't like but this you got you got this part right now hast thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans which I also ate he's havin ear let him hear what the Spirit says into the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Tree of Life who's Jesus Christ which is in the midst of the paradise of God now let's go to the second church age which is still covered under the first seal which is the white righteous church and in the angel of the church in Smyrna write these things saith the first in the last which was dead in his life I know thy works and tribulation and poverty but thou art rich and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not but are the synagogue of Satan fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that you may be tried and you shall have tribulation ten days be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a crown of life he doesn't have the neither let him hear what the Spirit says into the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death in other words they're not going to see that amen and to the angel of the church in Pergamos right this is coming up now look that's the second age there Pergamus is the third age just coming out of that white horse has been riding for several hundred years the devil's been riding in those churches come on people riding the churches the world is just the world the world's going to get bad Saint not worried about them he's the guy he's that anointed all there's demons to annoying everybody out there in the world the scratching what's that you fall down gee this is a family-oriented show come off of there I'm not jumping around uh boo devil all right but st. was running to that church what little sayings little bitty things don't you think my opinion is don't you think no this is what Paul said Paul said you'll be judged by my gospel what a stout thing to say and did the angel of church in Pergamos now this is heading towards the toward the third church age coming out of that age he's getting ready to get off of that white horse and get on a red horse these things says which he has to sharp sword with two edges he's still got the word I know that works and where thou dwellest even where Satan's seat is right there together amen now see he wasn't talking about Satan's seat being in a brothel you stole my Satan seat being right here in that in that third Church ain't and thou holdest fast my name they still even them to this age right here they still held that Lord Jesus Christ amen and has not denied my faith even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth you see Satan is already starting to physically kill them which is we're getting into the Reds that all right we're getting into the red but I have a few things against a now you've done all these great things but I have a few things against it because they'll hatch there them that hold the doctrine of balaam doctrine of balaam not a saying anymore who taught Baylock to cast a stumbling-block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication so hast also them that hold now they hated it in first age now they're holding it that hold the doctrine not the deed the doctrine of the licked Nicolaitans which thing in other words I still hate it folks I still hate this repent or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them what with the store to my mouth why that's a word the Word of God revelations 2:17 he's a half an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches to him that overcometh have overcome well I give to eat of the hidden manna and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth safe he that receiveth us now everybody in the world's but ever worried about these new names and all that stuff hey this is we're talking about the seals we'll talk about that later but there's no man going to know it except the one that receives it anyways watch this personal revelation to you a white stone is a revelation to me it's a true revelation hey man and it's only going to be to you so I'm not gonna stand up here and say well here's your white stone and here's your watch stone here no your revelation is to you and you got to be able to what receive it you got to be able to receive it Amen alright now look now we're going into the fourth days this is where we're going into yes we're going in the fourth age here watch and to the Angel of the church in sight I write these things saith the son of God who had his eyes like into flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass I know thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first in other words in that last stage when they really cuz they didn't start killing we'll read it in a minute they didn't start the Crusades and still until 1095 they started earlier but in 1095 is when all this other stuff starts piling up we'll read it in a minute because the age started 606 to 1520 the Crusades the Pope called in 1095 called for a liberation of Christian when I we know what happened that wasn't God telling the Pope to do that but now look under that read what the sanctification what is what is sanctification cleaned and set aside for service amen so keep that in your mind because will not read that to the written this morning notwithstanding I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel they let that woman Jezebel come right in and they suffered her in other words they let her come right on in and they just said well that's okay let's accept this because what happened is during that time the Pope's and all the even Constantine and all them what they were putting church and state together amen listen they were putting church and state together and they suffered that woman Jezebel in other words they said okay it's all right we're going to accept father son Holy Ghost baptism okay we're going to accept the Trinity yeah there's purgatory yes see they started accepting that now that had nothing to do with God I was just reading in there where brother Graham said Columba the reason he chose Columba because Columba was as much against the Catholic Church as Martin Luther was he didn't go with any of that stuff we said which college to herself or prophetess well you think the Pope was gonna say I'm the devil you think his bishops are gonna say well we're the devlin we're going to deceive you know they're going to say we're of God they call herself a prophetess to teach him seduce my servants my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto idols and I gave her space to repent of her fornication he gave that woman Jezebel and he served he gave Jezebel codes remember we were talking last night remember there are seven church ages in the Old Testament talk about that last night and I believe brother Branham said that Paul was chosen for the first church age because he was the what pattern messenger amen brother boards going through an insensitive class pattern messenger so whatever the church ages were patterned after they were patterned after Paul would not you think that the pattern messenger for the Old Testament would be Moses Moses everything patterned after Moses we read last not even in mouth I remember either law of Moses Amen so Moses was the pattern messenger for the Old Testament so he would be the first Church agent messenger to me in the Old Testament then you've got where Jezebel married who ain't how bad was did you and then he was a Jew when he married brother Graham said that's the dark ages of the Old Testament where church and state married each other she brought in what all them prophets are Bale she killed mother prophets but he lied you passed judgment on her he was given special ID you passed judgment remember he lied you didn't see or die get you type because remember we type Elijah amen Elijah's time for the bride we see Jezebel destroyed out here know it here in here we see Jezebel destroyed in here I gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not you know walk of the devil still thinks he's right behold I will cast her into bed now watch he cast her in the bed right here there was no denomination from here back this way because what our denominations the daughters of the Harley come on people the daughters of the harlot are the denomination oh well you believe it or not the only things what the Bible says what the Prophet said so he cast her into bed and then that commits adultery with her went into great tribulation except they repent of their deeds and I will kill her children with death there's your daughters they're to be destroyed in the end time I will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that I am he which searches the reins and heart and I will give unto every one of you according to your words but until you I say unto the rest of Thyatira as many has have not this doctrine and which have not known the depths of Satan as I speak I will put upon you none of the burden in other words in that church is all you did like brother Aaron said all they did was said they were Christian born-again Christians they automatically died he said well that's a burden no son burden the burdens let you live we got to thinking wrong a burden to let you live but that which you have already hold fast till I come and he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him will I give power over the nation's he shall rule them with a rod of iron and the vessels of a Potter shall they be broken to shivers even as I receive him my father and I will give him the morning star God never forget him he said he that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches they men so we come down to where we got the Dark Ages in the Old Testament but then what's the seven churches in the Old Testament who shows up Elijah John the Baptist to introduce the introduced the head what the property God doing the seven churches come on the sin and the Elijah anointing to introduce the head and then so there's your churches in the Old Testament but you see these sails riding right through those showing every characteristic that the seals have are right there in the Bible amen so this afternoon we'll stop right there this afternoon we're going to see that this red horse rider he was sent forth now the first seal was to conquer set forth conquering and to conquer divide and conquer he ceased he's not physically dividing and conquering he's spiritually dividing and conquering I'm right you're wrong I'm right you're wrong if you're not in my camp you're wrong I'm right you're wrong that's what happened that's what's that but now look it took look how strong the Word of God people it took a thousand years for Satan to really come out and say let's have a denomination because God was trying to work with look patience I will not forget you he's in overcometh will I give all these things there was nothing that God finally said you know if it'd have been mere you they'd have been mirror you our patience will be about that thing and we'd go now get out of here yeah I've had enough of you get out of here no God said this is the way I want it this is the way I have to have it to show my pattern that the church had to go down at Nicaea start going down and go down in the ground where they killed 68 million Christians do you know that's a third of the population of the United States or a little bit a little bit less so we have two hundred and something or 300 million people Oh in there it's just like going to wiping out like Europe every person 68 million you don't think that was strong you don't think that was red it was blood everywhere but remember in our contrast we have Satan riding on a red horse killing people giving him a sword taking peace killing but we have God's saying look I've got to do this to wipe this thing off because sanctification means cleanse and set aside for service there was something coming out of Martin Luther and John Wesley that was going to start to church back up amen so he had to start with cleaner everything off and getting everything ready then this afternoon we'll talk about that sanctification under the Steel's let's stand our feet hope that was all right for you to to get a basis of what we're gonna do and then we'll we'll go a little further this afternoon appreciate the time to be able to do this but remember when that seal breaks we know we're not sealed breaks that there's a red horse rider and that red horse rider is going out and he's now got not just to conquer and be a bluff that was one point I was gonna try to make remember in the first church age he was a bluff bow and no arrows now he's got some ammunition he's got a sword and with that sword he's going to want kill people brother Brown said physically 68 Millions unknown billions with this doctrine the doctrine is what come out that killed all the people that's what's killing us today folks the doctrine our own ideas is Kelce what's killing us hey man you love the Lord just pray for this afternoon we'll we'll get started on the sanctification under that seal but that original seal was in that Dark Ages Satan got off that white righteous horse and it just kept on going because it's still here today but he got on a red horse and he got mad he got mad because it wasn't working the way he wanted it working that first three church ages so he was going to now step out onto that red horse start riding and then he was going to have a sword in his hand and he was not going to just conquer he was going to kill cuz you can conquer a nation and not kill everybody but he's in the business to kill everything he wanted them all dead if it wasn't been for God holding that little remnant of people in that fourth church a saint would have wiped them all out under under the title of Christianity right that's what it is now under the title of Christianity Satan is killing people right amen but this afternoon we're gonna look at the red heifer and go back and see why she had to be red and while these things happen down through the Old Testament because brother Brown said you in top one silk and tie the whole Bible together we can go all the way back in the first Genesis 1 and we can come all the way down showing how God has done his work not our work is his work Jesus said thy will be done this thing so if you ever need for sinners slain give him more real people why do we give Him glory cuz we know now the full plan of redemption we know why those people cuz you know what we're gonna see them people we're gonna see them people in that for church age they won't be eat by lines anymore now they'll be standing just as perfect as you are [Music] but we'll be able to tell them why they had to go through that they went through that for me and you we can understand God more than any persons ever been on the earth floor here's a blood has the way you sing it one more time praise him down Oh and will praise Him I will parade great and for sinners late thank you Lord give him glory only people for his blood has washed away Easter amen you know something to think about this afternoon that sanctification that you came through will read it and I remember going through it just plain as day where the unclean spirit goes out of a man you just feel so empty you feel like that demons not going to ever come get you again but now read to you where brother Branham said if you don't fill it up with something because remember in the analogy of the jar the jar you know God picks the jar up it's dirty and nasty on the inside and out picks it up out of the mud pit and says I'm going to use this that's justification whatever it happened down here that's gone I have brought it to a place I'm gonna use and then then what does he do he goes in to his water pot washing of the water by the word washes it out amen but it's it still got a hold on the top you can still get mud back in it you can put poison in it you can put all kind of things in because it's just cleaned and set aside for service right but you got to fill it with something like and there was God knew he seals it there's the Holy Ghost he seals that and saying can't get in you're sealed that's the seal but the sanctification part is to cleaning out and getting it ready to be used God is saying okay this thing's dirty I'm gonna wash it by the water of the word amen but when the unclean spirit goes out of a man walks in Dry places seeking rest find this nun comes back to the house finds it swept and garnished and says I think I'll make him religious I'll put him in a message church and make him believe that God sent a prophet he comes right back in and makes you seven times worse than you were when you started I'm gonna tell you some people if you're not born again if you did not go through I'm gonna tell you this if you did not go through a definite stage of justification a definite stage of sanctification you're not born again now when Satan fills you up with a religious spirit what do you do you come to church you come to church you're saying you worship you might preach say it's a good preacher you know but that's the problem with this hour most people take that and that's there you're full of something today one way or the other amen now even when God seals it God seals it with the Holy Ghost we're on the outer Court again we got to go right back up to there now it's not a it's not a washing like the first one you know washing away cuts and smoking drinking and committing adultery you're washing away your knowledge and taking God's knowledge you're washing away a little bit of that temper that you still got and put guards temperance brother Bob said ain't got enough patience to wait you know what he said he said wait on God have patience the way don't God and go up that statue of a perfect man sure you're sealed that's what I just said but we're sealed our soul is sealed but going up the Statue of a perfect man God is still what burning out the trash sister Sheppard's dream remember there was still trying out he told he said you're born again right but they were still trash coming out we still have trash yes we still have trash called that spirit strong but now look that right there is where we're heading to where you are sealed as a total unit and you just as eternal as God is body spirit and soul can't happen brother you're an unbeliever that's why we're still here we are not believing what's already been said amen we just are not believing everything that God wouldn't I believe that God can just can't clean me up brother and clean my soul up and give me a new car but can I have the same talks of Jesus head oh I can't don't start that I can't business remember the three things you can't overcome is can't couldn't and wouldn't you can't overcome that I can't I couldn't do that I wouldn't do that you overcome in three and God can work on you because that's what he's doing he's working up this Way's working on the outside man he's working on the memories and conscious Vixen imagination of man that's what this is doing why so let that Holy Ghost that created the world you know I was telling you the other day I don't think but when we were in Alabama I preached on bringing in the soul of God and the different things and and brother Matthew was just having a he was having a Holy Ghost filled time letting me brother brother above still talking about it because he really never solved it then and I don't I'm just gonna say this that really that's what come to you new birth it's not a it's not a Holy Ghost that just as well it's God Himself not a third person it's the creator they said I'm moving in and saying you're moving out there to me that's Redemption I was lost but now fell by the Creator by the God that created everything he resides in me and I now control what comes out you control grieve not the Holy Spirit of God program said you can grieve him he'll go out on a limb he's a gentleman he said okay remembering that's why we're talking but the brother they're bringing an adoption what is he what his brother Bram used as an example for adoption he says the Holy Ghost comes down and looks at the child goes back to the father and says he's not acting like you now we know that's a drama but that's was actually what happens in adoption when when dust was about five years old he and drive your cars did he why he was a human yeah no he was a human though he had fight he had five fingers on he tell you right here he had a brain why did he drive the car he was the son of Mark action rock but why did mark getting the keys because he wasn't mature enough to handle the situation that was coming but as he grew up in God God handed him the keys God hands you the teeth that's why we come to church every Sunday folks could hate that key you got the key you're either better or worse that's what the Prophet said you either better when you come in and leave are you worse when you leave one of the zoo that's your choice though we're trying our best to open this thing up so we can see what's going on god bless you by your hands the Heavenly Father would pray Lord that you'll be with us as we go either natural meal just take care of each one of us Lord that we may have a zeal for you Father and not worry about the things of the world just come in and be under the Shekinah glory being that holy of holies with only you Lord as an individual we walk in there the Lord would come back out to walk the Christian life forgive us of our sins be with us Lord take care of us along the highways that have to go home we pray that you just be with us Lord may the fire be lit the brotherly week started winds denied may that fire be given more and more and more fuel so if that fire burned out all the stuff that's inside of us it needs to go be with us and take care of us until the service comes Lord two o'clock in Jesus name we pray amen you're dismissed [Music] go [Applause] Oh
