[1:49] turn to Hebrews
[1:51] 11 we will finally get down to speaking
[1:56] about
[1:58] faith the way we started out to do and
[2:02] trying to get to so just you know we're
[2:04] going to be on this for quite a little
[2:06] bit now and there'll probably be a lot
[2:09] of
[2:10] repeating uh because I want you to uh be
[2:14] able to understand what I'm talking
[2:16] about whether you believe it or not I
[2:19] want it to be you know uh for you to
[2:22] understand the way that I'm trying to
[2:23] bring it all right uh the Lord willing
[2:27] next weekend brother Tom ERM is not
[2:29] going to be able to come so he's not
[2:31] going to be here with us preaching any
[2:33] and brother uh William um sister
[2:36] Monica's brother will be here preaching
[2:39] for us now we don't know where both
[2:41] services or just one whatever we go from
[2:44] there but brother Tom Earnest and him's
[2:46] not coming you had to make a different
[2:48] Arrangements also now we had announced
[2:51] that we're going to have the uh 4th of
[2:54] July weekend a fish fry and we had
[2:57] announced that we were going to have it
[2:59] on Saturday and then regular services on
[3:03] Sunday and so some have wound up to be
[3:07] that they're going to be some kids gone
[3:08] to Camp Josiah and and little Zach and
[3:13] the family will be gone to Hall them and
[3:15] everything so we will be changing it to
[3:19] where that we'll be having a regular uh
[3:22] Bible study Saturday night all right
[3:26] everybody got it regular Bible study
[3:29] Saturday night on the 5th of July and
[3:33] then on the 6th of July we will be
[3:36] having a fish fry here we'll just have
[3:39] one service and then we'll have a fish
[3:42] fry afterward in the evening so that's
[3:46] changing the things around and make sure
[3:49] you get that now what we're announcing
[3:52] and tell everybody about it all right
[3:54] amen everybody got the scripture Hebrews
[3:58] 11 any other announcements I generally
[4:01] miss something I know that we uh
[4:04] appreciate God being with with uh BB and
[4:08] the baby and everything's fine so that's
[4:10] all right and made us a another great
[4:14] grandma and a great grandpa so we're
[4:16] getting them on up there now getting a
[4:19] crowd of them that's where it goes with
[4:22] the age and then our brother dick and
[4:24] sister Gail coming up to you say 59
[4:27] years and their an iversary today and we
[4:31] say to you happy
[4:34] anniversary so what anyone else anything
[4:37] else that we've
[4:38] missed all right Heavenly Father we
[4:42] thank you for all things we thank you
[4:44] that you are God and you change not and
[4:47] then that way we can depend on you we
[4:50] know we don't have to worry about it we
[4:51] don't have to be concerned about changes
[4:54] along the way we don't have to be
[4:57] concerned about having to find the
[4:59] changes or walk in but you've always
[5:02] been Hebrews
[5:04] 13:8 that's where Eve messed up in the
[5:06] garden by not believing that and that is
[5:09] the great test to be put forth before
[5:11] the people here in the end time is to
[5:14] see whether we believe you to be the
[5:16] same so we pray that you would just help
[5:18] us open our understanding forgive our
[5:21] sins bless us in Your Love in Your Grace
[5:24] and just have your way with us tonight
[5:26] in Jesus name thank you Lord amen
[5:31] Hebrews
[5:36] 11 now Faith is the substance of things
[5:39] hoped for the evidence of Things Not
[5:42] Seen for by it Elders obtained a good
[5:46] report through faith we understand that
[5:49] the worlds were framed by the word of
[5:51] God so that things which were which are
[5:55] seen were not made of things which do
[5:59] appear you may be seated the Lord at his
[6:01] Blessing to the reading of the word now
[6:06] we're going to try to get into this
[6:08] scripture and maybe on it for uh quite a
[6:11] bit on to the point because I want to
[6:15] drive this down hard for us to see it
[6:17] and and understand it but you remember
[6:21] now what we've been talking about a
[6:23] positive
[6:24] attitude to where that that we can can
[6:28] uh
[6:29] be positive about what we're saying and
[6:32] not negative CU negativism will get us
[6:35] nowhere but you know uh negativism is
[6:39] what causes most of your sicknesses
[6:42] because that way you you start going
[6:44] over on and getting into the wrong side
[6:48] and and the right mental attitude the
[6:51] prophet said toward any promise of God
[6:54] would bring that promise to pass all
[6:57] right so then we need to have the even
[6:59] just if nothing else we need to have the
[7:01] right mental attitude and the right
[7:03] mental attitude shouldn't be in this day
[7:06] and hour as I've emphasized over a
[7:09] couple of services it shouldn't be oh
[7:12] wowy wowy woo as brother for is always
[7:14] saying you know oh we're Downing out
[7:17] because of the problems and nobody's got
[7:20] troubles like I've got well we found out
[7:24] that nothing can't come upon you unless
[7:27] God permits it so wowy wowy yo
[7:32] woo you
[7:34] know are we trying to get away from the
[7:37] will of God for our lives or the thing
[7:41] that would bring us to
[7:44] uh the bases that God can come on the
[7:48] scene because we found out that you
[7:53] know God comes on the scene in
[7:57] the the oddest ways isn't
[8:00] right in all of our
[8:01] troubles heartaches and trials when we
[8:04] think we're all alone and nobody loves
[8:08] us that's when God is more on the scene
[8:12] CU he said I'll never leave you nor
[8:13] forsake you you remember the story about
[8:16] the the man wondering about the the two
[8:19] sets of footprints and then when it got
[8:20] down to the hard part you know there was
[8:22] just one set and uh he said Lord I don't
[8:26] understand it he said that's when I was
[8:27] having to carry you
[8:29] well we ought to be able to get down to
[8:32] the bases at least to have the right
[8:33] mental attitude remember what we found
[8:36] out too that God loves to test
[8:43] us and not tempt us he didn't tempt job
[8:48] he tested
[8:49] job he permitted the devil to bring upon
[8:53] job the things that was brought so as to
[8:57] to bring him to a test but he never made
[9:00] those things come as to tempt him
[9:05] remember what we tried to bring out
[9:07] Satan tempts God tests a lot of
[9:11] difference in the two yet you can think
[9:13] about the wording of it and it sounds
[9:14] like the same and it's all seemingly
[9:17] trouble but I was just thinking and
[9:20] trying to put down a few things on it
[9:22] you
[9:24] know Satan puts before us things to
[9:28] tempt us
[9:30] God doesn't put anything before you to
[9:33] tempt
[9:34] you now that that that would be the
[9:37] wrong thing he permits trials and
[9:40] troubles to come our way to test but not
[9:44] putting them there that they've got to
[9:47] be because if we would be right about it
[9:51] we could bypass a lot of our sicknesses
[9:53] and things if we uh didn't fail all the
[9:57] test you know and and if we fail them
[9:59] remember we got to go back to them again
[10:02] because that's the one way all right see
[10:04] God really tests Us by his
[10:07] word Satan tempts us with the world and
[10:11] life and doings and you know riches and
[10:15] and all kind of thing he tempts with
[10:17] those
[10:18] things but God tests us or tries Us by
[10:22] his
[10:24] word to see if we'll take the word and
[10:26] just stand on it right all
[10:29] and see that way he can mold a character
[10:32] into you and I you know and and bring us
[10:36] to the right place now
[10:41] remember it was at the end or the final
[10:44] test of
[10:45] Abraham that he was went up to offer his
[10:48] own
[10:50] son and then God really came on the
[10:55] scene job got as far as he could go God
[10:58] came on the S
[11:00] see my point has been one thing don't
[11:04] think that God is not with us or where's
[11:06] the Lord and and what have I done wrong
[11:12] listen I know I'm just too old too blunt
[11:15] too plain but nobody don't have to tell
[11:18] you when you do
[11:22] wrong if you're so dumb that you don't
[11:24] know when you do wrong then your
[11:27] dumbness is a problem that's a big
[11:32] wrong and brother R said you don't have
[11:34] to tell nobody that's wrong to commit
[11:37] adultery that's
[11:39] right but see that's what everybody in
[11:41] the message think we come in this great
[11:42] message and it's don't tear down the
[11:45] fence don't do this and don't do
[11:49] that we're to know them as human
[11:55] beings but you see then what did we end
[11:57] up by saying God allows these things to
[12:02] happen even permitted there in the Bible
[12:05] said if a if a prophet or a dreamer of
[12:07] dreams come and give you a sign and it
[12:11] come to
[12:14] pass but if he takes you after another
[12:16] God don't hear him now what's another
[12:22] God it's a it's a Doctrine or idea or
[12:26] concept which is contrary to the one
[12:29] true and living God that's right
[12:32] right is any thought or idea that we
[12:35] have that we could be something great
[12:39] because of who we are that's another God
[12:43] see it's not trying to find you it's not
[12:45] that that there's going to the devil
[12:47] can't come along in the end time and try
[12:49] to get you to go after a
[12:52] trinity no so it has to go with other
[12:54] ways and that becomes Our
[12:57] God so so then we we don't but yet what
[13:00] did we find out that God does that to
[13:03] prove
[13:04] to Satan you remember God of this evil
[13:08] age I believe it was that this bride
[13:10] would not
[13:12] fall and remember the fall of Eve in the
[13:16] garden the climax was bad but the start
[13:19] was just
[13:22] a not believing God would keep his
[13:26] word right Hebrews
[13:31] 13:8 but just remember testing brings
[13:36] God to you and
[13:38] I after the test well we got to go
[13:42] through the test but do you understand
[13:44] as I wrote down cuz he said I'll not
[13:46] leave you nor forsake
[13:48] you I'll be with you always it doesn't
[13:51] say
[13:52] always because that CES to wrong
[13:56] all it means wherever we need it he's
[13:59] there all
[14:01] right now as we start out on this point
[14:05] that we're talking about now to to move
[14:07] on over into the message a little
[14:11] bit I've asked this
[14:14] question a good many
[14:17] times is our faith mental
[14:21] Faith or is it substance
[14:26] faith and remember
[14:29] with mental
[14:31] Faith a cheap magician can break
[14:35] life move objects
[14:39] around people can walk on colds of fire
[14:42] and not be
[14:43] burned by mental Faith so don't think
[14:46] we're talking about something that is
[14:48] just so far till one goes one way and
[14:51] one the other remember Eve was deceived
[14:54] with Hebrews 13:8 that's very
[14:57] close all right
[15:00] and I asked a question over and over to
[15:03] you have you ever had God to show you
[15:08] something show you that you were
[15:11] healed amen show you something that was
[15:13] going to
[15:14] happen now I don't mean presumption
[15:17] that's what I'm we'll try to get at
[15:18] tonight what it is cuz see you can have
[15:21] presumptuous
[15:23] thoughts you know and hit pretty good
[15:27] with them MH you know you remember how
[15:31] that that they do it done in the
[15:32] Pentecostal Parts you know and the
[15:34] prophet would speak of it you know and
[15:35] they'd say well there's somebody in the
[15:37] building here tonight got a headache
[15:39] well no more than here tonight there's
[15:41] somebody's head bothered them and then
[15:43] if they say well nobody well it must be
[15:46] mine see those are great Revelation
[15:50] great uh you know anointing great
[15:53] discernment and you'll see what I mean
[15:55] by discernment later
[15:57] on but just remember now that we all
[16:00] start out with mental
[16:04] faith we think we start with some super
[16:07] duper something now Faith cometh by
[16:09] hearing and hearing by the word there
[16:12] was nobody in the Bible ever saved or
[16:15] healed just by a mental
[16:21] conception just believing it you know I
[16:23] believe
[16:24] it there's an upper room saying I
[16:26] believe it I believe it but they didn't
[16:28] get it until the time
[16:31] came right so then remember what we're
[16:34] talking about Moses was his great
[16:37] intellectual
[16:39] ability he had trained all of his life
[16:42] cuz his mother told him you know as she
[16:44] raised him that he was not the son of
[16:47] Pharaoh's daughter he was the deliverer
[16:50] of her you know and said Son you need to
[16:53] know everything so he trained and he
[16:55] trained and he studied and he he even
[16:58] taught the Egyptians as the Bible
[17:03] says but when he come to the trial and
[17:05] the
[17:06] test he got one dead Egyptian and run
[17:09] into the
[17:11] Wilderness but when he had an experience
[17:13] of the burning
[17:15] bush and he was out there 40 years
[17:18] thinking over well I thought I was a
[17:21] deliverer I believed I was a deliverer I
[17:23] tried to deliver looked like Mama messed
[17:27] up but see couldn't go on what mama said
[17:31] but when he had a personal experience at
[17:32] the burning bush then he was ready to go
[17:35] to Egypt because he had something
[17:39] real not an
[17:42] imagination out in the desert there he
[17:44] probably had a lot of
[17:46] imaginations you know they say you can
[17:48] look out there A lot of times and and
[17:49] just see
[17:51] water you see
[17:54] water you go running for it and it's not
[17:57] there right why because it's your
[17:59] imagination but yet to you it looks
[18:02] real like I always say an old drunk he
[18:05] sees pink elephants and things to him is
[18:09] real but to you is not but that's just a
[18:13] part of his imagination so don't get to
[18:15] point now that we're talking about just
[18:17] mental faith is just well it's so far
[18:20] over that way until brother Dale I know
[18:22] I don't have mental
[18:24] Faith remember mental faith in
[18:28] Christianity Realms now all right is
[18:31] based upon the word of
[18:36] God mental faith is based upon on God's
[18:41] word and mental faith comes by what
[18:47] hearing the word of
[18:49] God all right now in that part
[18:55] then when we talk about perfect
[18:59] Faith the prophet said on Blasphemous
[19:02] names you don't have to run up one or
[19:04] just wait we'll run up number two and
[19:05] start but we've been through this one
[19:07] Blasphemous names the biggest portion of
[19:10] our faith is mental
[19:13] Faith mental faith comes by hearing the
[19:16] word of God
[19:18] right spiritual faith comes by taking
[19:22] the word of
[19:24] God holding on to that word of God and
[19:28] believing that word of God is for
[19:33] you and God can make it alive amen then
[19:37] it can become a spiritual
[19:42] Revelation all
[19:45] right so no matter who we
[19:48] are a great super duper we think we
[19:51] are we all start at the same
[19:55] place we start by hearing the word of
[19:58] God
[20:00] some people didn't have the ability to
[20:03] believe whereas others will never
[20:09] believe because we're asked to believe
[20:12] the impossible amen
[20:15] right as far as what science says man
[20:17] says the world
[20:19] says when you say you're believing in
[20:25] God I'm not talking about whether your
[20:27] Trinity or Force or Oneness or tenness
[20:29] or whatever when you're saying that
[20:31] you're believing in God you're stepping
[20:33] out on the grounds Beyond human mankind
[20:37] because mankind is believing on only
[20:40] what can be
[20:42] proven as to be what is real so you're
[20:46] asked to believe something
[20:48] that in a way you can't prove
[20:52] it but then after it comes to that you
[20:56] can
[20:57] see that it's the one thing that is
[21:00] proven but it takes experience to come
[21:03] through that all
[21:05] right so no matter who we
[21:10] are no matter what it must start by
[21:14] mental faith and then let the hold that
[21:18] word you remember how the disciples
[21:20] wound up being saved they took the word
[21:22] the Bible said and held
[21:24] it that's why there was only 120 in the
[21:27] upper room and not 100,000 that maybe
[21:29] hurt him in his life or 10,000 that hurt
[21:32] him it was the ones who took the word
[21:34] and believed
[21:36] it and held
[21:38] on what about you and
[21:42] I it's those who were were not taken
[21:46] away by the cares of Life the things
[21:49] that The Parables the Lord Jesus spoke
[21:51] of but they took it and held on to
[21:54] it they said one day said where can we
[21:57] go thou has the words of eternal
[22:01] life they' at least come to a position
[22:05] that they knew of no other place to
[22:08] go all
[22:11] right I I think you and I ought at least
[22:14] be that far amen because you take what
[22:18] you got and try to walk across the
[22:20] street over
[22:21] here now you go over there and keep your
[22:24] mouth shut you're all right you're
[22:25] brother that's right but you go over
[22:28] there to open your mouth and you're out
[22:29] the
[22:30] door and I'm not throwing off on nobody
[22:32] that's the their doctor their
[22:35] ideas
[22:37] right you get my
[22:40] point where do we have any place to
[22:44] go oh those people try it they go back
[22:46] and they do this and they do that you
[22:49] know but we at least be far enough along
[22:52] now to realize hey there's not anything
[22:55] else for you and I amen so let's move on
[22:59] right now remember this
[23:03] point and it would be good to even write
[23:05] it
[23:07] down mental
[23:09] faith is
[23:12] not a substance
[23:18] Faith mental
[23:21] faith is an
[23:25] imagination it's a hope
[23:28] it's a
[23:30] wish it's a
[23:33] desire right but it's not a
[23:38] substance all right like we said Peter
[23:40] he was doing fine
[23:44] right he was walking on
[23:46] water but then he lost his
[23:50] substance still has confession about
[23:52] Jesus being God and the Savior and but
[23:55] he lost his
[23:56] substance
[23:58] remember
[24:00] Moses he never had the substance he had
[24:02] a mental
[24:05] concept but when he met the burning bush
[24:07] and brought something personal to
[24:11] him now how many times have I said this
[24:14] so far I keep illustrating
[24:17] it probably Martin Luther in his desires
[24:22] was to try to and he is all writings
[24:25] about it what he's WR he didn't want to
[24:26] leave the Catholic Church he wanted to
[24:28] reform the Church that was why it was
[24:30] called a Reformation he was trying there
[24:32] were a lot of people in those days
[24:33] trying to reform the Church you know
[24:36] move it back to the word the middle and
[24:38] and and coming back to God with it and
[24:42] and he probably done a lot of speaking
[24:44] about the just shall live by
[24:48] faith but one day the message of that
[24:53] hour became a reality to
[24:56] him and when it did he like Moses at the
[25:00] Burning Bush was ready to challenge the
[25:04] world upon what he
[25:07] believed all
[25:09] right right cuz he had something real
[25:13] on we'll get to it in a little bit he
[25:16] had a
[25:18] substance that before then he had a
[25:21] confession an
[25:23] imagination a
[25:26] desire
[25:28] but only when that become a
[25:31] substance in the man's
[25:37] life now how many times have we went
[25:39] over it see Wesley what about
[25:42] him they came a day
[25:45] when he saw what was
[25:48] needed he came to America to be
[25:51] converted I mean the Cur convert to
[25:53] Heathen and got
[25:55] converted right the moravians or how you
[25:57] pronounce it they introduced him to the
[25:59] message of sanctification but they never
[26:02] conquered the
[26:03] world so their
[26:07] message are you listening was not the
[26:11] message of that age even though they
[26:14] were talking about
[26:15] sanctification even though they were
[26:17] talking about doings and
[26:21] deliverances are you
[26:23] listening but when John Wesley saw that
[26:27] message it was the message of that
[26:31] age zusa Street
[26:36] Pentecost people had spoken tongues and
[26:38] different things down through
[26:41] time the gifts had been in operation in
[26:45] her
[26:47] degrees but one day there was an age
[26:50] happened they needed a
[26:53] messenger and that messenger went out
[26:55] speaking of the speaking in
[26:59] tongues see all we do is we argue about
[27:02] well they just done this and they done
[27:04] that even some of the brothers that used
[27:06] to come to church here with us they were
[27:08] back in the Pentecostal mood said there
[27:11] was some of them preachers would tell
[27:12] them people just because you spoke in
[27:15] tongues don't mean you got
[27:18] it cuz they believed in speaking in
[27:21] tongues yeah but they believed in a
[27:23] change in
[27:25] life you go out and live like the devil
[27:27] speak in tongues all you want
[27:30] to that doesn't mean you're a
[27:34] Christian you understand what I'm
[27:35] getting
[27:36] at well we are supposed to
[27:40] be in the end
[27:43] time that this Prophet came to bring us
[27:46] the
[27:47] message of the entire
[27:51] Bible brought his message has passed on
[27:54] left it with
[27:56] us
[27:59] and as I tell my wife the other day we
[28:01] have spent most of the time most people
[28:03] spend the time reading and listening to
[28:06] brother brandom to try to find out him
[28:08] talking about himself when he was
[28:11] talking about a
[28:14] bride he was talking about a
[28:19] church that was where I gave the quotes
[28:21] right the bride would be the fullness of
[28:24] the godhead
[28:26] bodily h where the bride would be the
[28:29] son of
[28:32] man the bride would be the same grain it
[28:35] went into the
[28:36] ground that would come
[28:39] back well then when are we going to
[28:41] stand up and say this is
[28:48] that see we're going to have to have an
[28:51] experience to match the age that we're
[28:53] living
[28:55] in not a going to church and being good
[28:59] or claiming a message a prophet
[29:03] brought and I've told you over and over
[29:06] they didn't care when Martin Luther
[29:08] protested the Catholic church but when
[29:10] the people begin to become one with his
[29:13] message they got
[29:16] upset all right the prophet brought his
[29:20] message it died
[29:22] down right come on it went
[29:26] around
[29:30] now people are trying to raise up to
[29:33] believe that message is speaking about
[29:36] them and now it's when Satan is going to
[29:40] get
[29:42] upset because it's always been that
[29:45] way all right now I'm talking about a
[29:50] people that brother brandham said
[29:52] quoting it he said that it was no
[29:55] problem in the days of Luther that he
[29:57] could protest the Catholic
[30:01] church he said but to hold his head
[30:03] above all the
[30:04] fanaticism that followed the
[30:07] message that was the greatest of all
[30:10] that was more sure that he was the
[30:12] messenger of
[30:14] God is when the people had the same
[30:19] experience when we have the same
[30:21] experience as
[30:22] individuals and a group of people put
[30:25] together to be the Bride of Jesus Christ
[30:28] that the prophet has brought unto us
[30:31] then we can talk about something real
[30:36] right all
[30:38] right we can stand upon what we believe
[30:42] then that's
[30:45] it it won't be like we talking about
[30:47] brother Bob was talking about there the
[30:48] other Wednesday you know didn't want
[30:50] nobody to know that the preacher said
[30:54] you know God talking about they want
[30:55] nobody to know what he believed I want
[30:58] everybody to know what I
[31:00] believe I would love to be able to stand
[31:02] as Martin Luther did that day and maybe
[31:05] we'll get a change when they asked him
[31:08] said did you write this what was his
[31:10] answer he didn't know what was in the
[31:14] pile
[31:16] right he said but what I
[31:19] wrote I believe
[31:21] it all right all the garbage that goes
[31:24] with this message I don't believe
[31:29] but what's revealed in my heart I
[31:31] believe amen and I'm willing to stand
[31:34] upon believing
[31:36] that you
[31:38] know and no matter what it cost us why
[31:41] can't we
[31:42] be but
[31:46] now mental
[31:49] faith is not
[31:53] a
[31:56] substance
[31:59] it's an
[32:00] imagination which is something that you
[32:04] you think are uh you know you think it's
[32:08] a
[32:09] substance but it's just an
[32:11] imagination a hope is a desire of
[32:19] fulfillment see you think you have
[32:26] it
[32:27] there's where the problem's
[32:31] at but we read in
[32:33] Hebrews
[32:37] one that it says
[32:40] faith is the
[32:43] substance of
[32:45] things you're hoping
[32:48] for expecting Desiring or imaginations
[32:52] that brought to your uh part of your
[32:54] being that you're Desiring after
[32:56] something
[32:59] it's the
[33:00] evidence of Things Not
[33:03] Seen
[33:09] now this is this is a hard point because
[33:13] of trying to break down a little line
[33:16] right here for you to
[33:19] understand and I don't mean that you
[33:21] don't I'm just mean it's a hard thing
[33:23] for all of us to understand it's hard
[33:25] thing for me to understand to separate
[33:28] between uh what we've been
[33:31] taught what we've thought was
[33:35] right to bring it down to a uh a concept
[33:40] at least that we can be scriptural about
[33:43] it and then let God Quicken that to
[33:48] us all
[33:52] right you know how that I've always said
[33:54] it that firew Walker
[33:58] that firew Walker he enters into an
[34:00] imaginary
[34:03] situation and he walks on the
[34:07] co
[34:11] right that preacher who has the great
[34:14] ability to
[34:17] uh even bring healing to
[34:24] people but you put this message in front
[34:26] of it
[34:27] and let him begin to see what this
[34:29] message really
[34:31] is and they'll lose every bit of those
[34:34] great super duper things that they
[34:36] thought they
[34:39] had you know what if you lose it then it
[34:42] evidently would no good
[34:46] right it evidently had no substance to
[34:51] it now I've looked up substance to try
[34:55] to to bring bring it you know backwards
[34:58] and
[34:59] forth and the word substance is used in
[35:02] about three different ways or four that
[35:04] I've finding throughout the
[35:07] scriptures and substance can be
[35:09] referring to just uh structural ability
[35:13] you know houses cars uh wood trees
[35:19] animals uh those things is dealing with
[35:22] a
[35:23] substance you know
[35:25] this
[35:27] pullit all right this is a
[35:31] substance it came off of a tree you know
[35:34] an old
[35:38] tree and it's a
[35:40] substance it's
[35:43] hard all
[35:46] right but now when you're dealing with
[35:49] substance
[35:50] faith in the Bible
[35:54] terminologies and I'm trying to break
[35:56] this down down now so
[36:00] listening when you're talking about
[36:03] scriptural or spiritual
[36:06] faith our substance
[36:09] faith that we just went through that
[36:12] mental faith is not a substance Faith uh
[36:15] Peter had substance Faith but he lost
[36:18] his substance went back to his mental
[36:21] part all right now so there's a
[36:24] difference between mental faith and
[36:27] substance Faith substance faith has
[36:31] something behind
[36:33] it you
[36:35] know and really in relationship to
[36:40] it this is
[36:42] wood this is a
[36:45] substance but according to what we read
[36:47] there in the
[36:49] scripture that it says it's the
[36:51] substance of things hope for the
[36:53] evidence of things not
[36:58] seen all right which
[37:01] means whatever this
[37:04] tree that this wood was cut out
[37:08] of at one time was in
[37:13] non-existence according to our
[37:15] terminologies of substance right run it
[37:19] all the way back you back to an acorn
[37:24] right come on and the acorn was put in
[37:28] the ground and it come forth and made a
[37:31] tree of
[37:34] substance but when we're talking about
[37:36] Bible terminology of substance remember
[37:39] it's where the acorn came
[37:43] from are you
[37:45] listening that Acorn came from
[37:50] somewhere and it came from an unseen
[37:54] situation as far as our ways of thinking
[38:01] all
[38:02] right but we understand that through
[38:06] faith the worlds were framed by the word
[38:09] of
[38:11] God so that things which
[38:14] we are
[38:17] seeing were not made of
[38:21] things which do
[38:25] appear so when we're talking about
[38:27] substance
[38:29] faith we will be going back further than
[38:32] the mental mind of
[38:38] mankind all
[38:44] right because see we give the definition
[38:47] of
[38:51] substance and as we
[38:54] do as I said now
[38:58] substance what anything consist
[39:02] of but remember there was a time this
[39:05] wood was not in
[39:07] existence right there was a time it was
[39:11] an acorn then there was a
[39:14] time that it wasn't no Acorn that's
[39:19] right then there was a time there was no
[39:21] tree or the acorn that's right
[39:25] right there was a time that there wasn't
[39:27] nothing
[39:30] right and God said let there be
[39:36] that's all right now when he said let
[39:39] there be that's the word of God
[39:43] Amen so we're going to find out that the
[39:45] only substance we can depend on is the
[39:48] word of God Amen I hope you'll write
[39:51] that down and take it with
[39:53] you I prayed of how to try to express
[39:56] this part because you just say faith is
[39:58] a substance substance what anything
[40:00] consist of you it just goes right
[40:06] through but
[40:08] remember if there is a
[40:11] substance of
[40:14] anything that substance at one time
[40:18] never
[40:19] existed in the form that we call a
[40:25] substance you keep on going on back back
[40:27] back tree tree tree tree tree until amen
[40:33] you would wind back in the garden and
[40:35] there'd be a tree
[40:37] right but then you keep on backing
[40:40] up until it would be no tree that's
[40:43] right and there'd be no atoms no
[40:45] molecules
[40:47] no
[40:49] scientific
[40:52] abilities and you will go back into the
[40:54] world of what we call
[40:56] the
[40:58] unknown the reason we call it the
[41:00] unknown because we don't know about
[41:05] it but yet the Bible tells us
[41:10] right that it was made from things that
[41:12] do not appear come
[41:16] on now
[41:18] remember if anything ever came into a
[41:23] substance somewhere
[41:29] that started as a word of
[41:35] God all
[41:38] right he didn't have from some other
[41:41] civilization to take a tree and bring it
[41:44] on the earth and plant it you
[41:51] know he didn't have no
[41:53] 99.9% gerti seed you know that's the
[41:57] best you can
[41:58] buy you can't buy 100% gerti seed
[42:01] whether you know that or not go try it
[42:05] you only get about 96 or something like
[42:09] that but yet the word of
[42:16] God said let there
[42:18] be all right now there is the connecting
[42:22] of what we want to hang
[42:24] to is that
[42:28] word is the
[42:37] substance now come
[42:42] on and if that word is a
[42:49] substance then you got to back up past
[42:51] the
[42:55] substance
[42:57] because it says faith
[43:00] is the
[43:08] substance meaning that one time it was
[43:11] not in
[43:14] existence of the way we
[43:18] think because then it would have been
[43:21] the thoughts of
[43:25] God in his
[43:28] mind there's where faith is going to
[43:33] lie cuz come on we're going to get down
[43:35] to where we run to where the Prophet
[43:37] said if you got to a quarter you got the
[43:39] loaf of bread well you can run that and
[43:42] run that and run that you better keep
[43:43] running
[43:45] it because one time he said it like this
[43:49] he says now the
[43:51] quarter is only the purchaseing
[43:55] power
[43:56] the quarter is not the
[43:59] bread it is only the purchasing
[44:04] power that must all be brought together
[44:06] correctly or we'll miss the point of
[44:09] what really is saying in
[44:12] Hebrews all right but are you following
[44:14] me now now
[44:17] Faith is the
[44:19] substance of things hope
[44:23] for all right so you going
[44:28] backward and you find the first
[44:30] substance that we can deal
[44:32] with as understanding because it's hard
[44:35] to deal I know in the human mind as to
[44:40] God and how really is I understand that
[44:44] understand most people can't go back and
[44:46] talk to you about before the world and
[44:48] believing that God existed and walked
[44:51] around and and
[44:54] everything cuz they want to believe a
[44:56] spirit and I want to get
[45:00] into but remember
[45:02] now before it can be a word it's got to
[45:05] be a
[45:09] thought all
[45:11] right so now before he said let there be
[45:15] an oak tree a world a substance
[45:19] Etc tangibility or whatever you want to
[45:21] call
[45:24] them
[45:26] whatever brought this wood into being
[45:29] was already
[45:31] there there's your
[45:34] substance and remember it comes from the
[45:37] mind of God which is the
[45:41] faith faith moved over into a being of
[45:46] Let There
[45:49] Be are you following
[45:53] me faith God God himself alone Elohim
[45:58] self-existing whatever you want to call
[46:01] it but he had
[46:05] thoughts and in his thoughts was the
[46:08] whole concept of trees houses cars this
[46:14] that the other
[46:15] people but none of it was
[46:18] into
[46:24] substance are you with me
[46:26] right but then one day he
[46:29] said Let There
[46:31] Be Right the word amen Prophet said not
[46:36] another God not another he said it's a
[46:39] part of God but said not like a arm
[46:42] flying off of
[46:48] this see it was the
[46:50] word he said let there
[46:54] be now you see a
[46:57] substance what a
[46:59] world right let there be this let there
[47:03] be that let there be this let there be
[47:05] people it all wound up to be
[47:11] substances but before it was substance
[47:13] it was
[47:18] Faith the reason it's saying faith is
[47:21] the substance remember that's present
[47:23] tense
[47:24] is
[47:26] faith is the
[47:28] substance CU whatever created this world
[47:31] is still
[47:32] here
[47:35] believe he didn't go nowhere he's still
[47:40] here all
[47:43] right and in being
[47:48] that he could become a
[47:53] substance right
[47:57] right
[47:59] condescending all right see not talking
[48:02] about a desire of fulfillment he never
[48:05] had a he now don't get me wrong don't
[48:08] okay I don't have the education just
[48:10] forgive me I just try to
[48:12] preach God desired these things into
[48:15] come into being but his desire these
[48:17] can't bring these things come into being
[48:20] didn't bring it into being at that
[48:24] time in his
[48:27] mind was reality to him but in his mind
[48:31] was not the
[48:33] substance we deal
[48:39] with but it's what brought this
[48:43] substance all
[48:46] right what is a
[48:49] substance we can talk about faith let's
[48:52] deal on this substance part and then
[48:54] we'll go back to
[48:56] faith and I hope you follow what I mean
[48:59] by that and you'll see that the faith is
[49:02] the part of God that is his
[49:07] thoughts and he delivers his thoughts to
[49:13] you
[49:16] right and then when he delivers it to
[49:19] you it can become a
[49:24] substance Jesus you don't have to have
[49:27] the
[49:30] tree see that's what we think oh yeah
[49:32] yeah Lord Heal Me Lord Heal Me I'll Go
[49:35] tell everybody about
[49:37] it but if I go tell them I'm Healed and
[49:40] I'm still sick I'm a
[49:43] liar and I don't want to
[49:45] lie you don't want me to lie to you
[49:48] brother Dale you born
[49:51] one you got all the makings of it why
[49:54] tell one more
[49:56] is there any problem if you lied all
[49:57] your life I got a buddy of mine up used
[49:59] to work with he lied he lied so much he
[50:02] believed his own lies well would one
[50:04] more lie hurt
[50:09] him now you know I'm not talking about
[50:11] we got a lie you know what I'm talking
[50:14] about you're a liar when you won't say
[50:16] you're healed that's
[50:18] right that's according to the Bible
[50:21] right sir let the sick say so
[50:26] amen what that they're
[50:29] healed
[50:31] right but let's just get on to this
[50:36] substance cuz I want you to see
[50:38] something about substance tonight and I
[50:41] know we'll carry on to later
[50:43] messages go ahead brother Joe and pull
[50:46] up the word substance there in Hebrews
[50:52] 11 and look what it
[50:54] says now remember as I said all the
[50:57] others are dealing with like when you
[50:59] say substance and the substance that
[51:01] they came down with all their substances
[51:03] you know or something like that in the
[51:05] Bible and all it would mean the things
[51:07] they possess and and all but then watch
[51:10] what this gets to all right it means
[51:13] confidence or
[51:16] confidence the word substance means
[51:20] person now they're just giving you the
[51:23] um Hebrew
[51:26] oh excuse me Greek they're giving you
[51:28] the Greek definition of a
[51:30] word they're not supposed to be
[51:32] interpreting
[51:34] it you know they're not supposed to be
[51:36] putting in there what they think they're
[51:39] supposed to be telling you what it
[51:42] says and the things it can relate
[51:45] with so it can be a person watch a
[51:49] setting or placing
[51:52] under thing put under
[52:01] substructure what is a
[52:06] substructure it means something under
[52:08] your structure that is that okay it
[52:11] means you got a structure you got this
[52:14] under this building is a foundation
[52:16] poured footing Etc substructure and you
[52:19] look down to bottom and there's a
[52:21] concrete
[52:22] floor you know substructure
[52:27] underneath the word substance means
[52:37] Foundation that which has
[52:41] Foundation substance is that which has
[52:44] Foundation I hope that I've just got
[52:46] through describing it as to going all
[52:48] the way back to God and coming down and
[52:51] saying in his mind and then he spoke it
[52:57] all right that which has Foundation is
[53:01] firm hence that which has
[53:04] actual
[53:09] existence a
[53:13] substance it's a real
[53:16] being you know what point would you be
[53:21] driving at if you would keep calling it
[53:23] even a person are are are a great super
[53:28] struct uh
[53:30] substructure a great
[53:32] foundation and going back to that which
[53:34] as a foundation if you're not going back
[53:37] to the word of God and God
[53:43] himself right so it's a real
[53:47] being all
[53:49] right now I've asked you the question
[53:51] over and
[53:54] over
[53:55] has God ever showed you something that
[53:57] was going to take place has he ever
[53:59] healed
[54:01] you I mean healed
[54:04] you you know that one minute you're sick
[54:06] the next minute you're
[54:08] well or you're sick one day and three
[54:10] months later you as well what's the
[54:12] difference you know there's more faith
[54:15] in the the gradual than there is over a
[54:18] complete
[54:20] deliverance but you know a lot of people
[54:22] have never
[54:23] experienced what I'm trying to
[54:27] say because I'm talking about the same
[54:30] thing that I talking about Martin Luther
[54:33] when that one day he stood here with a
[54:38] confession he stood here with a saying
[54:41] he was saved he stood here with
[54:44] confessing Jesus Christ as his savior he
[54:48] stood here on one side with with making
[54:51] great proclamations maybe about faith
[54:54] and substances and
[54:57] thing but then one day amen something
[55:00] happened to the man right you think you
[55:03] could get that away from him
[55:07] no Hallelujah come
[55:09] on they burned them in oil they cut
[55:13] babies out of the mothers back there and
[55:17] fed them to the
[55:19] Hogs and they didn't deny Jesus
[55:23] Christ you better have a substance when
[55:26] you're put up against the wall
[55:28] right imaginations won't help you then
[55:31] good feelings won't do it you jump over
[55:33] on the other side you
[55:35] know you know what I
[55:37] mean
[55:40] substance that which has
[55:44] actual
[55:49] existence so now substance then is
[55:53] greater that form of what
[55:57] you then this Oak
[56:00] W because remember the oak wood came
[56:04] because of the
[56:05] substance in the
[56:08] beginning all
[56:13] right it can go to a quality or a nature
[56:16] of a person the steadfastness of your
[56:19] mind firmness courage resolution
[56:21] confidence firm trust
[56:23] assurance what from the word
[56:30] substance
[56:32] now Webster
[56:34] says you know your Webster
[56:38] dictionary
[56:41] substance
[56:42] that of which a thing
[56:49] consist physical matter or
[56:53] material
[56:56] something that has a
[56:59] separate or
[57:02] independent
[57:05] existence you remember we read our is an
[57:07] actual existence Webster says it's
[57:10] something that has a separate or
[57:12] independent existence so everything's
[57:14] independent everything's different
[57:18] everything's you know oak tree pine
[57:21] tree just that way you know dog C
[57:26] at each thing has a separate
[57:31] existence cuz he's saying was the word
[57:33] of
[57:41] God brother Mo used to have a good
[57:43] saying he said substance is what
[57:45] anything exist
[57:48] of whether natural or
[57:51] spiritual and I wrote that down 40 years
[57:54] ago and I you know it's a good
[57:57] statement what do anything consist of
[57:59] because isn't that exactly what we just
[58:01] read from
[58:04] Webster that is what something consists
[58:07] of is physical matter or
[58:11] material it's
[58:15] real even an acorn is
[58:19] real break it on down inside of there is
[58:22] a germ of life
[58:25] that's
[58:30] real Faith then is the
[58:37] substance all
[58:39] right so now remember what we're trying
[58:41] to
[58:43] bring it was not substance
[58:49] first it was Faith
[58:53] first
[58:58] do I need to preach over what I got
[58:59] through this preaching CU I'd hate to
[59:01] have to try it cuz I got to have a bit
[59:02] of that just while I was preaching it
[59:04] would you believe it or
[59:06] not I had to change my whole thing I
[59:08] have
[59:10] already so don't ask me to try to preach
[59:12] it back over you just listen to the
[59:15] tape but I will assure you of one
[59:20] thing
[59:23] faith
[59:25] is the
[59:29] substance of what you hold
[59:34] for when do we get down to
[59:39] evidence
[59:43] faith it was more real in
[59:47] faith than it is in
[59:51] substance you say no it's substance it's
[59:53] it's real over here here okay all this
[59:56] going to be burned up one day now where
[59:58] are you
[1:00:00] going all these old oak trees and
[1:00:02] benches and pews and churches are going
[1:00:04] to burn up where are you
[1:00:09] going we better back up to Faith because
[1:00:13] faith is the thing that you're talking
[1:00:14] about substance is no
[1:00:20] problem
[1:00:22] right we just got to get to Faith
[1:00:28] and if it's not Faith then it's not a
[1:00:30] substance if it's imagination mental
[1:00:33] reasoning
[1:00:36] Etc it's not a
[1:00:39] substance until faith is made
[1:00:43] alive so you got to go that
[1:00:46] way right we keep trying to go this way
[1:00:51] right remember we keep going this way
[1:00:54] all this is is going out of
[1:00:56] existence right I I want to back up this
[1:00:59] way you know what I mean to anybody on
[1:01:01] internet or anybody don't understand me
[1:01:03] I I want to back up not to just in the
[1:01:06] mind of God because in the mind of God I
[1:01:09] could bring myself totally out of
[1:01:11] existence I want to back up into the
[1:01:14] point of being a part of the mind of
[1:01:17] God and I cannot lose my
[1:01:20] faith my faith will hold
[1:01:23] me I'm talking about faith being more
[1:01:27] real than any substance you can think
[1:01:33] of are you
[1:01:36] listening faith is more real sister Gil
[1:01:39] than this wood because it brought this
[1:01:44] wood it's more real than the metal or
[1:01:48] the car you rode in to get to
[1:01:53] church
[1:01:56] the
[1:01:57] faith it is the substance but you got to
[1:02:01] get it on faith
[1:02:05] first we want
[1:02:07] substance oh
[1:02:10] yeah I got an arm missing oh yeah when
[1:02:13] my arm comes back I'll say I got
[1:02:22] faith that's a scientific
[1:02:25] fact if that arm appears again it's gone
[1:02:27] it's that's scientific fact you ain't
[1:02:29] got nothing to do with faith anything
[1:02:31] are scientific ific fact ain't got
[1:02:33] nothing to do with
[1:02:34] faith come on but if I can stand here
[1:02:37] and look at it and say my
[1:02:41] arm God
[1:02:43] has revealed that it will come
[1:02:46] back in his time when he wants it to be
[1:02:50] nothing to me I see my
[1:02:53] hand
[1:02:55] listen church I have no parts missing
[1:02:58] but maybe some of you do here I've heard
[1:03:00] people talk about that a finger be
[1:03:03] missing or a hand missing and they can
[1:03:06] feel still still feel it
[1:03:11] itch right and they'll be rubbing what
[1:03:15] you doing that
[1:03:17] for I can feel that finger when did you
[1:03:21] get it cut off 20 years
[1:03:23] ago
[1:03:26] see the mental connections of the mind
[1:03:29] and the nerve endings and the things has
[1:03:31] recorded into our brain some way and
[1:03:34] those things will
[1:03:36] work but remember it doesn't say
[1:03:38] substance is the
[1:03:43] faith we're turning it
[1:03:48] around it says faith is the
[1:03:52] substance of anything thing that we hope
[1:03:58] for it's
[1:04:01] real it's not an
[1:04:05] imagination let me just read a few of
[1:04:07] what the prophet had actually to say on
[1:04:09] this I know we won't get through but go
[1:04:11] ahead number three brother Joe Dr
[1:04:15] Moses we deal a lot with
[1:04:17] psychology or whatever how you pronounce
[1:04:20] them big old
[1:04:22] words but in Psych ology it doesn't take
[1:04:26] the place of
[1:04:27] reality what he said psychology is
[1:04:31] something you're thinking of are of
[1:04:34] mentally worked up
[1:04:36] to walking on colds of fire all kind of
[1:04:42] things but the reality is God's placing
[1:04:47] that in
[1:04:49] confirmation of your
[1:04:53] psychology you understand what he's
[1:04:55] saying it starts off mental
[1:04:57] Faith psychology mental faith God takes
[1:05:01] your mental Faith makes it a reality by
[1:05:05] bringing it into a revelation to
[1:05:10] you if you got a revelation your
[1:05:13] Revelation is just as solid as God's
[1:05:17] revelation if it's a
[1:05:20] revelation all
[1:05:22] right what faith is substance of things
[1:05:24] hold far the evidence of Things Not Seen
[1:05:27] It's
[1:05:28] actually an
[1:05:33] Evidence something
[1:05:36] positive when it's confirmed to
[1:05:46] you are you
[1:05:48] listening It's actually an
[1:05:50] Evidence I show you how far we're going
[1:05:52] to have to swap this thing backwards
[1:05:55] brother Joe you're going to have to jump
[1:05:56] over to number
[1:06:01] 18 can you do that it'll take him a
[1:06:04] minute but he'll get to
[1:06:07] our and listen to what your Prophet has
[1:06:09] to say on the message have faith in God
[1:06:12] 1958 paragraph
[1:06:15] E6 some thinks that it's a mental
[1:06:17] conception of the word but that is not
[1:06:20] right faith is a substance
[1:06:24] to a lot of people in this message think
[1:06:26] because brother brandham said it I
[1:06:28] believe it it's a substance that's not
[1:06:31] right I don't care who it is families or
[1:06:34] who it is I'm I'm just me they can say
[1:06:36] all they want to about
[1:06:38] me but I'm just say in plain language
[1:06:41] it's not a
[1:06:42] substance just because you can read it's
[1:06:45] not a
[1:06:47] substance we could read the Bible before
[1:06:49] the prophet
[1:06:51] came but we had that so actually
[1:06:57] confused come
[1:07:00] on look what he says faith is a
[1:07:03] substance faith is not a myth say faith
[1:07:07] is a substance of things H for the
[1:07:10] evidence now listen to have an
[1:07:17] Evidence it must
[1:07:20] be a
[1:07:22] substance
[1:07:29] I would write that quote down if I were
[1:07:30] you and read it over and over about 20
[1:07:33] times each day to have an
[1:07:36] Evidence it must be a
[1:07:39] substance so it's it is not just
[1:07:42] something that you imagine in your
[1:07:45] mind it's something that absolutely you
[1:07:52] have
[1:07:55] it's something that you possess in your
[1:07:58] own
[1:08:02] being now you see why the prophet would
[1:08:04] say the biggest portion of our faith is
[1:08:06] mental
[1:08:10] Faith an
[1:08:14] Evidence is something
[1:08:17] proven you know a statement approving to
[1:08:21] doing see if I can
[1:08:24] bring it up
[1:08:27] no an
[1:08:32] Evidence is
[1:08:34] reproof a
[1:08:37] proof that by which a thing
[1:08:40] is proved or
[1:08:46] tested that's number
[1:08:50] 1650 that by which a thing is proved or
[1:08:53] tested it means a
[1:08:56] conviction
[1:08:58] right so now
[1:09:01] it's if you're going to talk about an
[1:09:03] Evidence you got to have a
[1:09:08] substance now you see where you going
[1:09:10] with your gifts and your signs and your
[1:09:11] wonders and you're speaking in tongues
[1:09:13] and you're doing this and you're
[1:09:14] believing that and Etc what you're
[1:09:16] calling the evidence of the Holy
[1:09:22] Ghost there's only one evidence of the
[1:09:25] Holy
[1:09:31] Ghost only one evidence of the Holy
[1:09:33] Ghost and what is it whether or not the
[1:09:37] spirit in you agrees with the
[1:09:39] word is that
[1:09:41] right you can call it love you can call
[1:09:44] it this you can call it that you can
[1:09:45] call it gifts you can call it all kind
[1:09:47] of but there's only one evidence of the
[1:09:50] Holy Ghost right it's whether or not not
[1:09:53] the spirit in you agrees with the
[1:09:56] word all
[1:09:59] right
[1:10:00] now back to our
[1:10:04] substance cuz that's what I'm trying to
[1:10:08] prove I'm talking about
[1:10:10] faith as something that we don't
[1:10:14] generally relate to I guess is a better
[1:10:17] way of saying it without hurting
[1:10:22] feelings
[1:10:24] but the biggest portion of our faith is
[1:10:26] mental
[1:10:29] faith and mental faith comes by
[1:10:33] hearing it's not
[1:10:39] psychology but then God can
[1:10:42] take if our psychology is
[1:10:46] right he can take that cuz psychology is
[1:10:50] a is your doctrine of a mind or thoughts
[1:10:53] or whatever you are you
[1:10:55] know
[1:10:58] you all
[1:11:02] right he can take that and make it a
[1:11:05] revelation
[1:11:07] amen and see what he does he takes our
[1:11:11] mental
[1:11:12] faith our hope our imagination our
[1:11:19] thoughts what did the prophet say when
[1:11:21] your mental Faith perfect faith Faith
[1:11:23] there mental Faith becomes a spiritual
[1:11:32] Revelation all right we don't lose our
[1:11:34] mental
[1:11:37] Faith but I will explain the difference
[1:11:39] between the mental faith and the
[1:11:41] spiritual Revelation in this
[1:11:44] point the world is made up of a lot of
[1:11:46] different doctrines and in this message
[1:11:49] and all kind based upon mental Faith but
[1:11:53] there's only one Supernatural Revelation
[1:11:57] so there can't be that many doctrines
[1:11:59] that's
[1:12:00] right so all of that is a mental
[1:12:04] Faith now mental faith will never put
[1:12:08] under your feet something to hold you
[1:12:11] up unless God comes down to Quicken it
[1:12:16] right and from my understanding unless
[1:12:20] I've missed the message in the Bible
[1:12:23] that God cannot
[1:12:27] Quicken our thoughts if they're not
[1:12:30] according to the
[1:12:33] word I mean if I'm wrong there I'm just
[1:12:36] wrong because that's what I believe he
[1:12:38] can't Quicken something that's not right
[1:12:41] right the Lord revealed to me a trinity
[1:12:43] and I get up to heaven you ever you ever
[1:12:45] heard him I get up to heaven and he
[1:12:47] ain't three up there I'll just turn and
[1:12:49] walk out cuz I ain't the wrong I'm in
[1:12:50] the wrong place oh my boy that's great
[1:12:53] super duper
[1:12:55] imagination that's that's really what
[1:12:58] did you see how strong he believes what
[1:13:00] he believes he said he just walk
[1:13:08] out walk out of
[1:13:12] Heaven come on quit being dumb the alone
[1:13:16] stupid walk out of
[1:13:19] heaven cuz he said if he went to heaven
[1:13:22] and they wouldn't tree up there
[1:13:26] right he just walk
[1:13:29] out boy that's man he had the Revelation
[1:13:32] that's a great Revelation he had that's
[1:13:35] a great Revelation when I seen that
[1:13:36] brother he dra out that light and it
[1:13:38] went across this way pulsating and it
[1:13:40] went over here and it come down here and
[1:13:43] it created and it come on down
[1:13:45] and
[1:13:52] yeah
[1:13:54] remember mental faith hope whatever is
[1:13:58] not a
[1:14:05] substance but faith is the
[1:14:09] substance all
[1:14:11] right we'll get back to more in it later
[1:14:14] but I know we can't go much
[1:14:16] further we're well familiar with the
[1:14:19] Rapture message where the Prophet says
[1:14:22] that
[1:14:25] faith is a
[1:14:32] revelation
[1:14:35] right faith is a
[1:14:41] revelation so if you say you got a
[1:14:47] substance you're going to have to have a
[1:14:51] revelation because a revelation will
[1:14:53] bring the substance substance don't
[1:14:55] bring a revelation you're going
[1:14:58] backward Faith brings the substance
[1:15:01] remember it's Faith first faith is the
[1:15:07] substance Faith brings it into
[1:15:11] being what you're Desiring
[1:15:22] for we
[1:15:25] substitute hope for
[1:15:31] Faith I just hold these other quotes
[1:15:34] till
[1:15:35] Sunday well if I preach one if I don't I
[1:15:38] don't worry about it I'll have for next
[1:15:41] time but listen
[1:15:46] Church you can't be saved by mental
[1:15:49] Faith but yet you must have mental Faith
[1:15:52] before you can become s right right you
[1:15:55] can't be healed by mental Faith but yet
[1:15:57] you must have mental Faith to come to a
[1:15:59] healing Factor that's right all right
[1:16:02] that's why people that are lost can be
[1:16:04] healed because it's not based on the
[1:16:06] same basis as salvation is based upon
[1:16:10] you know that the healing part is not
[1:16:13] all but remember the illustration or the
[1:16:16] point I kept trying to
[1:16:18] bring Faith is the substance
[1:16:25] all you've done is moved it or what
[1:16:27] would be a word I don't understand it
[1:16:29] folks I don't have that
[1:16:31] education but what you do is you take
[1:16:33] Faith God took didn't take Faith he was
[1:16:37] faith and from what his thinking was and
[1:16:40] his you know his whole Faith
[1:16:43] makeup he just said let there
[1:16:46] be and it became a
[1:16:49] substance right that's right of what he
[1:16:53] was hoping
[1:16:55] for which was a
[1:16:58] world right right and a
[1:17:01] people to live on that
[1:17:05] world so he went from his
[1:17:09] Revelation he brought it down closer to
[1:17:12] Earth and made a substance out of it
[1:17:15] we've got to go that
[1:17:17] way so what we've got to do
[1:17:20] is declare
[1:17:25] that we're already
[1:17:27] healed before he can make it a
[1:17:32] revelation there's were the problems
[1:17:36] at we got to declare that we're saved
[1:17:39] before he can make it a substance he
[1:17:42] doesn't save us give us a substance come
[1:17:46] on that's
[1:17:50] right you're going to have to say it
[1:17:52] first
[1:17:55] and say it by not just a mental
[1:17:58] imagination come
[1:18:02] on I remember something I can't remember
[1:18:05] exact story but maybe brother Ram didn't
[1:18:08] tell the person but I'll put it like
[1:18:10] this that there was somebody that was
[1:18:12] real sick sick like a young
[1:18:15] lady and his point was maybe some of you
[1:18:19] can help me remember it but his point
[1:18:21] was to the girl if God heal you what
[1:18:23] would you
[1:18:24] do
[1:18:29] right would you glorify God or would you
[1:18:32] go back to where you
[1:18:41] was you see if it was a faith
[1:18:45] substance she wouldn't consider going
[1:18:48] back to where she
[1:18:50] was but if it was a mental conception
[1:18:54] she'd go back to that point I
[1:18:56] illustrated by a lady we were talking to
[1:18:58] a young lady we were trying to introduce
[1:19:00] him to the message and somebody said
[1:19:02] something about we're going to have a
[1:19:04] glorified body well I'm sorry I
[1:19:08] just there she was with short dress and
[1:19:12] painted face and all kind of things but
[1:19:15] when it come down to speaking about
[1:19:16] going back to a glorified body she was
[1:19:21] just and I didn't have to have no great
[1:19:24] discernment to know what she's talking
[1:19:30] about would you if I
[1:19:33] said she was talking about you mean this
[1:19:37] body that I've got is about 20 30 pound
[1:19:40] overweight it's going to come down to
[1:19:41] beauti and I'm going to be beautiful and
[1:19:48] I'm I mean that's what I
[1:19:51] thought
[1:19:54] because of her
[1:19:57] reactions is that what the prophet said
[1:19:59] about the girl if God healed you what
[1:20:01] would you
[1:20:11] do see church
[1:20:13] Faith then comes before the substance
[1:20:17] matter can be
[1:20:21] considered but here we
[1:20:24] are we don't wait for the faith to
[1:20:27] confess the substance because we're
[1:20:30] going
[1:20:31] backwards if you don't get anything
[1:20:33] whatsoever tonight I'll don't get this
[1:20:35] point let's confess What God
[1:20:42] Says then he can make it a
[1:20:45] substance
[1:20:49] right but as I said if you ever had him
[1:20:53] to come speak to you when you knew what
[1:20:55] it was going to be you had no troubles
[1:20:59] you know what you done done you done got
[1:21:01] the substance before you ever even
[1:21:04] thought about it being out in the body
[1:21:05] to heal it or
[1:21:07] anything you had a
[1:21:15] revelation see
[1:21:18] then it's not only just talking about
[1:21:21] creating world or
[1:21:25] whatever I want to go back and be part
[1:21:27] of that that's in God's mind before the
[1:21:30] world when he thought of what he was
[1:21:32] going to
[1:21:35] do but to do that I must stand
[1:21:39] here and take God's
[1:21:42] word and I'm sick I need healing I must
[1:21:47] stand here and say by his stripes I am
[1:21:54] already
[1:21:56] positively
[1:22:07] healed
[1:22:10] salvation
[1:22:13] Salvation believe in your heart confess
[1:22:16] with your mouth is that the
[1:22:19] scripture you got to say it before you
[1:22:22] can have it that's
[1:22:26] right you got to say that you're saved
[1:22:29] before you can be saved but then when
[1:22:32] God quickens that to you it's over
[1:22:37] right when he makes that alive to
[1:22:40] you it's
[1:22:42] over yeah we can do like a man did at
[1:22:45] work one day he said I used to wonder
[1:22:47] about being a Christian because there's
[1:22:48] so many troubles going my way but said
[1:22:51] one day I found out Christians have
[1:22:53] troubles so I know I got to be saved why
[1:22:56] because you're having a lot of
[1:23:00] troubles is that what you're saying
[1:23:02] because you got a lot of
[1:23:06] troubles remember job wouldn't
[1:23:10] guilty we want to make all of our tests
[1:23:12] and trials you know I'm sorry now blunt
[1:23:16] we want to go out and do something wrong
[1:23:18] and get venial
[1:23:20] disease and then say I'm in a test
[1:23:25] sorry for being
[1:23:27] blunt but you'll think it
[1:23:32] over that's tempting that's not
[1:23:37] testings That's what Satan put before
[1:23:40] you a test is when you're
[1:23:45] right job wasn't wrong the reason he was
[1:23:49] tested he was right that's right well
[1:23:52] all them problems coming my way it might
[1:23:55] be that we got a lot of
[1:23:59] wrong well let God Brother D I've
[1:24:01] checked it all
[1:24:02] out well maybe that is where we need a
[1:24:06] prophet because remember one time I
[1:24:08] doing a story that was telling and this
[1:24:11] young person was having a lot of trouble
[1:24:13] and nobody couldn't figure it
[1:24:15] out he sat there and told him said you
[1:24:17] stole money from a church when you were
[1:24:20] 16 years
[1:24:21] old
[1:24:23] did you go make it right and God will
[1:24:25] heal
[1:24:30] you oh but I confessed all of them I
[1:24:33] asked God to forgive me of all of that
[1:24:34] all of that's
[1:24:41] gone remember the
[1:24:46] lady that they couldn't figure out what
[1:24:48] was wrong with her brother brand went
[1:24:51] back in her life and said you remember
[1:24:53] the day you was running around on your
[1:24:58] husband she had that so pressed down
[1:25:01] till the psychologist couldn't get it
[1:25:03] out of
[1:25:06] her she was a Sunday school
[1:25:14] teacher but you see
[1:25:17] Church we're missing what faith really
[1:25:21] is
[1:25:25] faith is a revelation of God's will for
[1:25:28] your life and
[1:25:33] mind you see why the prophet said we
[1:25:35] need a revelation more than
[1:25:40] anything you know you can't be saved
[1:25:42] without a
[1:25:44] revelation you want to
[1:25:47] quote you can't be saved without a
[1:25:51] revelation well I can't accept remember
[1:25:54] the first I can't accept Revelation he
[1:25:55] said then you can't be
[1:25:58] saved but did the person do anything
[1:26:01] about it no they went away I am Sav
[1:26:03] bless go he can't tell
[1:26:06] me like I told a man here one time I
[1:26:09] said the way you're acting shows me
[1:26:11] you're not saved he went around told
[1:26:13] everybody I said he's lost I never did
[1:26:15] say is lost I said the way you're
[1:26:19] acting
[1:26:21] right come on I had a right to say that
[1:26:24] didn't I where you're acting Christ
[1:26:27] don't act like that that's
[1:26:31] right but of course everybody's on his
[1:26:33] side brother Dale you shouldn't have
[1:26:34] told him his lost I didn't tell him he
[1:26:37] lost he told me he was lost that's
[1:26:41] right come
[1:26:47] on
[1:26:49] faith is the
[1:26:56] substance of what's your hope
[1:27:00] are so we start out saying I hope I'm
[1:27:02] safe
[1:27:04] right come on ain't a person in the
[1:27:07] building didn't start out that away I
[1:27:09] hope I'm
[1:27:10] saved what do you do you keep confessing
[1:27:13] it until he saves
[1:27:16] you then you're delivered right he's
[1:27:19] brought a substance into being
[1:27:23] a
[1:27:25] reality because of
[1:27:28] substance is something you
[1:27:35] possess when I stood at that doctorine
[1:27:38] life that day and told him I said you
[1:27:39] won't take my kneecap off I spoke from
[1:27:43] something besides
[1:27:46] myself I still got my
[1:27:51] kneecaps
[1:27:55] how many times have you ever been
[1:28:00] healed and like I said the other day
[1:28:02] then we turn around and somebody come
[1:28:04] around and say well I'm Healed I'm this
[1:28:07] that or the other you say I'm Healed of
[1:28:10] cancer I got a complete bill of help
[1:28:12] from saying that you know I had cancer
[1:28:15] and God heal me I say it's totally wiped
[1:28:18] out in my body well what it is now uh uh
[1:28:21] that sign ific fact can't cover back but
[1:28:23] 4,000 or
[1:28:25] something meters goes and all that stuff
[1:28:27] so that means that journey is still
[1:28:29] laying that jemy is still in there but
[1:28:31] you it just ain't showing up on records
[1:28:33] you are a great
[1:28:35] help
[1:28:39] wonderful I love to hear you talk like
[1:28:47] that well a doctor give me a complete
[1:28:49] Bill people got a complete bill of
[1:28:51] health and died three days
[1:28:54] later you're a wonderful
[1:28:58] help devil gone on
[1:29:02] vacation he don't have to be
[1:29:07] around we're so
[1:29:10] smart but if you ever get a substance
[1:29:13] I'll guarantee you one thing I asked
[1:29:15] somebody the other day she said I've had
[1:29:16] it one time but if you ever get one
[1:29:19] time if you're ever delivered one one
[1:29:22] time from a sickness no matter if you
[1:29:25] got it instantly or if you had to wait
[1:29:27] on it don't make no difference but
[1:29:30] during that time you could not be talked
[1:29:33] out of your healing because it had been
[1:29:37] said how many of you would stand like I
[1:29:40] did when I told my wife I said that will
[1:29:42] happen or I'll never preach
[1:29:50] again come on
[1:29:53] why can't we be put on the spot that's
[1:29:58] right if you got the goods you ain't got
[1:30:02] to worry about
[1:30:03] it
[1:30:05] right see the reason I'm not afraid of
[1:30:07] what I preach is because I've always
[1:30:09] tried to preach what the prophet brought
[1:30:12] in the Bible so then I'm Not
[1:30:15] Afraid are you challenging the world no
[1:30:18] I'm just saying to the world I ain't
[1:30:19] afraid of
[1:30:20] you come on show me where I'm wrong God
[1:30:24] I want to be right that's
[1:30:29] right but can you stand on a
[1:30:33] substance now I going to say this word
[1:30:35] and then quit has it ever been revealed
[1:30:37] to you there just one
[1:30:39] God or is it still just an
[1:30:45] imagination if it's been revealed to you
[1:30:49] you have the substance of all almighty
[1:30:57] God and you don't mind it being
[1:31:01] tested that's right come on musicians
[1:31:04] you don't care if the world's against
[1:31:08] you if you got a
[1:31:11] substance
[1:31:20] right I tell the dream that I had one
[1:31:22] time some of you have heard
[1:31:24] it you don't put everything on a dream
[1:31:27] but sometimes they good
[1:31:30] dreams and I dream about 10 times every
[1:31:33] night so I'm an old
[1:31:37] dreamer garbage can dreams and
[1:31:39] everything
[1:31:40] else but in a dream one night I was
[1:31:43] standing in my front yard most of the
[1:31:47] clouds storms comes directly from the
[1:31:50] front yard from over pice W's house
[1:31:53] coming to that way is our worst
[1:31:55] storms worst wind and the thing and then
[1:31:59] this dream I was standing there and not
[1:32:02] just trees flying but great big boulders
[1:32:05] almost as big as this church was flying
[1:32:08] through the air right by
[1:32:11] me I was just standing
[1:32:14] there and all at once out of
[1:32:18] that
[1:32:20] horrible boulders and all come a man
[1:32:22] riding on a
[1:32:24] horse he rode right straight towards
[1:32:28] me and he
[1:32:32] stopped now all of these Boulders flying
[1:32:35] by and he
[1:32:37] stopped he looked at me and he said
[1:32:40] don't use
[1:32:42] that how many of you have heard me tell
[1:32:44] a
[1:32:46] dream don't use
[1:32:48] that I look down in my hand I had a
[1:32:52] slingshot
[1:32:55] hallu a guy come riding out of big old
[1:32:57] Boulders and storms and things but he
[1:33:00] was afraid of a
[1:33:02] slingshot and he said don't use
[1:33:09] that I thought we
[1:33:11] understood that it was not David that
[1:33:14] killed
[1:33:15] Goliath but yet he had a
[1:33:17] slingshot and in that slingshot he had a
[1:33:20] rock in those rocks he had
[1:33:27] Faith see the devil is afraid of your
[1:33:31] faith he ain't afraid of your statements
[1:33:35] you're talking you're rattling he'll
[1:33:36] rattle with
[1:33:39] you but he's afraid of it when you take
[1:33:42] God's word and say that's
[1:33:46] it
[1:33:49] right that's what it says
[1:33:55] there's just one true and living
[1:33:57] God there's just one way in the Bible to
[1:33:59] be baptized name of the Lord Jesus
[1:34:01] Christ not father Son and Holy Ghost I'm
[1:34:04] just stand on the word
[1:34:07] right there wasn't but one Prophet
[1:34:09] promised for the end time to
[1:34:11] come there's not but one bride promised
