Description:
1) 63-0728  CHRIST.IS.THE.MYSTERY.OF.GOD.REVEALED_  JEFFERSONVILLE.IN  V-3 N-7  SUNDAY_
«  102       †          Now, God's secret mystery, He had before the world began. Now, back in the back part of God's mind, there was something that He was trying and was going to achieve, and He had a motive in doing it, in order to let Himself be expressed. Because, first, there wasn't even a moon, star, atom, molecule, or anything. He was God. But He exactly wasn't God at that time, because God is an object of worship, and there wasn't nothing to worship Him.
103    So, in His great mind, He wanted these attributes to be expressed. And in Him was love; in Him was to be Father; in Him was to be Son; in Him was to be a Saviour; in Him was to be a Healer. And all these great attributes that we see already expressed, they were in God.

2) 63-0728  CHRIST.IS.THE.MYSTERY.OF.GOD.REVEALED_  JEFFERSONVILLE.IN  V-3 N-7  SUNDAY_
«  105       †          Now, God had a purpose and a hidden mystery. And that's what I want to speak on to the Church this morning, the hidden mystery of God that He had in His mind before the world ever began, and how that it's unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living. See? Then you will understand clearly then, you see, on, I believe, what is being done.

3) 64-0705  THE.MASTERPIECE_  JEFFERSONVILLE.IN  V-4 N-7  SUNDAY_
«  44       †          Now let us turn the page, of Michelangelo, and close the book.
And let's open another Book and read of the great Sculptor, the Almighty. Who, before there was a world, and before the foundations was laid, He had in His mind what He wanted, and He wanted to make man in His Own image. He wanted to make something in--in reality of what was a vision to Him, what was in His thinking.

4) 64-0216  IDENTIFICATION_  TULARE.CA  V-22 N-14  SUNDAY_
«  58       †          But, see, all that is, it's displaying showing by type, like the whole Bible, God coming together with a redeemed Wife, a Bride that God had...

you're alighted and shining each one of our hearts and lives forgive our sins because we want to be covered by the blood and guide us in Jesus name Amen John 1c we're going to finally get to verse 3 where he's the creator but it'll be a few more messages just hold on a while okay says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God in the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was a lot of men a lot shyness and darkness and the darkness comprehended it not alright we go to Colossians to pick her a thought for tonight Colossians 2 verse 8 beware less men's bands for you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ all right because we don't we're going if we keep it all into Christ then we'll come out to verse 9 for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power you may be seated the Lord added blessing to the reading of the word now I hope that you remember this make this little statement before we start on the message you remember about two months ago I made the statement that I believe that we were in the end time and in time for the bride to recognize who she is and the Prophet was saying you know when she realized who she is then all to be over with it'll be going out and we're doing all right and I told you I said the brothers here are really picking up to minister and I said the ministers are coming in from the foreign fields to minister and cush what we had for trees represented and we had five preachers well I believe each one of them picked up a good thought carried on the thought of doing I believe it was the Lord that led them to to speak and then brother Brady finishing it all up because see brother Brady would have brought it into the testimony on the morning service of how that go to random went to the Olive there and you know in Jamaica and the things that had happened later in a different thing but the thing that happened about his wife where brother Branham called him out in the service and said you know your wife will be okay all right that to me is what we call a living witness and I'm glad the Bible speaks plainly of saying that there's you know it was kind of talking like everything's running out there in the scriptures and it says but those people laughed something to that degree you know there there's people left that saw these things and I'm very pleased to fellowship among the people that did see the things called we don't put any emphasis no more than what it is it's a truth that God did come down in the last days and you know bringing the word all right all that's well and good but the main thing I want is the word these because I can believe brother wrote told me he said I've seen the dead raised a sick healed I've seen all kind of thing I said that's wonderful I said I believe you so I'm not doubting you have no reason to but I said you just saw that you tell me what he told in the word and I'll know from my own experience whether he was a prophet or not but I couldn't go by what he saw because he could be lying about it you know if people could be lying today about this side the other but if you got something personal with inside of you then all the rest of it's wonderful because that's you know things to dwell upon and real good alright but now see I'm still trying to express to you something that I'm you know I'm trying to bring out from my thoughts to your thoughts of the fact of how that God came into manifestation or whatever the words you want to call it came into view came into revealing himself and showing himself and coming down through time and how that he started out as the great self existing on the word I would be used Elohim because that would just be the fact that that would be the only word they could pick up I guess to everybody to be able to understand what it meant and how that it was God to reveal himself all right but then how he come down and manifested himself through this and we're but we're still back I'm still back before time in other words my thoughts are still dealing with what took place before time came into being all right we've got a lot to do then we get over time and then we'll see why John says that all things were created by him and all and who was to him according to my Bible Jesus Christ is to create cars all right not Jesus the flesh but Jesus the Christ he's the creator and that's why it was wonderful when Peter said thou art the Christ he was actually recognizing Jesus as being the great eternal God that created all things because he called him the Christ so it was brought out all right now that's what I'm still trying to do is we haven't got over into to time all right and I know I have a very odd way of expressing things and you know it's all right I'll try to get it expressed one of these days but now remember what I've always taught you that no matter what you think about what somebody is saying check it out with the Bible and see if it's right check it out with the prophets message to see if it's right they may be right and you might be wrong all right but that's you know check it out and see what's what is happening and remember that no matter what you think I'm saying that I have never taught any way of thinking that we come into the world with eternal life you say well I've got where the Prophet said this and probably said that that's good I got scriptures too that says a lot of things about you know we'll get into those scriptures and time but the thing about it is people want to bring this eternal life and they don't want to wait because if you came into the world with eternal life then you explain to me why Jesus Christ had to die I mean that's the only question I'm God if I come in the world eternal life Jesus Christ is not to die so that means I didn't come in with it all right now we use the word redeemed but you ever thought about the word regime yeah we know what it means to go back where we come from that's good that's real good that's straight that's right redeemed mean to go back where you come from but then how come everybody in the message wants to kind of keep you and try to give you eternal life when you come into the world he said what do they do that yeah they do that because if redeem is correct then it means you fail is that sensual to be regain back where you came from means you fail from dark is that sensible that doesn't need a great big light bulb turn onto to explain that little point does it it just plain language that if you're going to go back to where you came from that means you fail from dark that means you never came that away all right and we'll get to those signs as we're going along but I don't want you to ever think then you know you hear me talk about it and reading and giving the quotes of the Prophet in the scriptures I and people get the idea of it that you're thinking about you know we're random would say you always was eternal well now if that's not understood in the correct understanding you sure got a lot messed up in your Bible and you got a lot messed up in in the truth so we want to stay with that until we can see it in the correct order so no matter what you think I'm saying just remember I am NOT saying and I've never told that we come into the world with eternal life because that would annihilate Jesus saying you must be born again that would annihilate all of the things it would put the whole thing out of shape alright you say but but the Prophet said it will amen but remember if you don't understand what the Prophet said and it goes in the right order you can make him say anything you want to that's as plain as I can put it but I want you to see that fact because I believe you must be born again all right that was Jesus's first doctrine you must be born again all right I believe that according to the Bible that I must believe in my heart Romans right and confess with my mouth I must do that to be saved it's not to die just say well I always was eternal I've had people who looks right you can't tell me I'm not eternal always was he terminal you know I mean telling you that he'll tell you that to your face because they're trying to stay with some idea or some concept but I've never believed done like that so now I want that in here to where when we start reading things or talking about things you won't have that in mind you'll say wait a minute now he said he never believed that way of what it sounds like is being say it see I believe the Bible were you born in sin safer than iniquity and the spouse from your mother's womb and you're going forth a liar and you're doomed and on your way to hell and if you don't get born again you've got a problem I've always taught that and always believed it so when you come up to the word always was or thoughts like I'm trying to bring of how that something was transpiring before the foundation of the world before this world ever came into existence we've been through it we're in Joe we're talking like the morning stars sang together the sons of God shouted for joy we've been through that your name was written in the book of the book of the life of the Lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world it was done before then we've been through all the things on predestination because I've been preaching this for forty about forty eight years and I'm glad that we've got at least a pice thirty years still left in our tape collection that you're welcome to go to and see if I change the doctrine it's not being sarcastic it's being truthful I do a lot of things a lot of other preachers don't they said we're on the internet system and I don't cover a lot of things but there's a tape being made right back there that is kept anybody preaching in this church that tape is kept for us to see if I change if we change if Bob change their hearing changer this change or you know we've got them down we can check it out I'm always glad if you do that not being no sarcastic way just being truthful because I want you to know what I believe and then you can make up your mind whether you believe it or not because I can't reveal it to you come on is that what Peter said you say into Jesus dark necropsy said now wait a minute I'm paraphrasing brother around him with the wording he said my said jesus said my own life didn't reveal that under the Peter he said it was a father in heaven it revealed that and said I ain't gonna build on nothing on you as a rock I'm gonna your revelation of who I am right all right see that away then we keep it straight and we keep in mind what we're trying to do no all right still back before the foundation of the world and our thinking still back in the point of thinking about before the world ever was even thought of or anything happened that God existed knew how freaks didn't believe it I've got quotes for it and read it to you that God is a being he's a person but he's not one two three cuz ain't no society he's either God are we the most mixed-up people that has ever been alright we see them believing that he is real believing that he is not like the wind blowing to and fro then he's not just some kind of a spirit moving around and seed we always had that you know we all love that then God is a spirit and they that worship it much worse than in spirit in true well then how you gonna work some in spirit and truth you ain't in the same spirit here is that sensible you're not in the same spirit he's in how you going to worship in spirit and truth all right but see just to be to get to point to where we were driving at the last message you remember how we were talking about it that God in His great mind before anything ever existed you ever NAT that would ever come into the world I wouldn't the one that wrote the Bible where he said that we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world I didn't not to word he did I didn't write where he said you didn't choose me I chose you well yeah but I wouldn't ride and I prayed you don't understand the rest of the Bible either what does it say it says the goodness of God is what leads you to repentance read your Bible you'll find out it's got a lot of good things in the goodness of God is what drugged you and out of God no man can come to the Father what Jesus said in the length under me unless the father draws him right it's all right now see we got the whole thing settled in the basis of understanding but my point is trying to get us to think about that we could not have existed back tyre as people you know we wasn't spirits we gave those quotes we was in the mind of God all right but what about the mind of God as I've always told you I don't want to be just in the mind of God because Judas Iscariot was in the mind of God I don't want to just be in his mind I want to be part of his mind I want him to be into me so much until his mind and Paul would say that what let the mind that was in Christ be in you it'll make you a new creature what I do and give you a new bird I won't dad I want to be a part of the one that was doing the thinking not to just a thought in his mind he thought of Judas Iscariot he thought of Adolf Hitler he thought if everybody's ever be in the world he knew everybody's ever be in the world right what you see we'd say what I want if I was just in his mind well how much you in this mind now I want to go back and find out it I'm part of this man and well I don't see how you can be that well why not are you part of your father alright are you part of your father are you part of your grandfather are you part of your great grandfather the great grandmother great the great the great the great great I mean what greats you need your part of that right because of the DNA by the DNA you can be all the way back and that's why I love the Bible see here it comes alone back there and Levi paid tithes while he was in Abraham ask roots ring you said well how'd he do that because it was representation coming all the way down before the foundation of the world I said in job said where were you in the morning stars sang together the sons of God shouted for joy that was back before the world ever started see what we think of predestination and and things like that is we think we haven't figured out now that it's by foreknowledge well amen because the Bible says those who he for no he did predestinate all right foreknowledge is before predestination we've got that straight at least it ought to be that if you've got any form of predestination you got to back up behind ur to a foreknowledge because the foreknowledge would cause him to predetermine it see I don't see why we can't accept the truth really I do know why because it's not meant for a lot of people lunch I'll read you the Hat in the Prophet it's not meant you know that God was talking about the other day he didn't know I had all these in my notes I believe it was him that mentioned or one of the brothers anyhow you know that God didn't come to save the devil's children right didn't come save the devil children while you're making it we're a lot of people can't recite no I'm making it work if they're not God's children they won't but I'm making it this way do you know that when you've got lost and you come into this world as a sinner you work in folks to the devil whether you like it or not the devil is my daddy if I'm not born again he's your daddy if you're not born again right see then that puts it all straight and in line there's no arguments because you say yes but we believe predestination praise God I do too but I believe that the foreknowledge comes before the pre determining all right why can't you back up a little further then into God's mind that's what I've been trying to do why not back up to the point of where he was thinking come on back up to where his those who he foreknew or for Noah's Obama fair when I back up to where his thinking was that you might find out you're part of this thinking you might find out you're part of him wouldn't it be wonderful well you sound like that you're saying that there's people that that's what I said you get it in your mind and you say well brother Dale is saying that he's talking about somebody being eternal now I'm talking about eternal life I'm saying it over and over to for me and you to have eternal life we've got to receive eternal life that is the gift of God is that right eternal life through Jesus Christ all right so keep it in straight in your mind what I'm saying well where were the morning stars and Suns of garden and all that where is that taking place see let's back up a little farther than read estimation look back up into his foreknowledge and we might find that we're a part of that we'll find out the right way that we're a part of it today don't like us anything when it settles the whole situation of predestination it settled the whole thing of these things that are messing people talking about I come with a seed in me I believe that but the only problem I mind is one time when was the seed put any may I ask simple question I love questions you know that I love questions an answer we have questions and answers on the first Saturday of every month we love it we just get down and we talk about things and we have some pretty good little girls every once in a while you might call it discussing things because we just allow everybody to discuss it you know and talk about it why not see is just a simple question and then I asked for a simple answer but can you give me the simple answer without making it such a great monstrosity or trying to express it and understand it we listen to the simplicity of a little seventh grade educated man who explained all of these signs when was the seed of God put in you biggest portion people this message believe you come to see Jenny I do too but you better get it right you don't talk to me about it how about saying where the prophet said you seed was put in you you know where he when he said the seed was put in he said was put in before the foundation of the world I got him here live in front of me so you want to agree the mighty one don't now get to it Sunday cuz I'm I'm worried I've had two months now to study on this to try to express away to where we could understand if the seed was put in you before the foundation the world that's easy to catch them know I was born with this seed is put in me when I had one will you show me the Prophet was put in you where nears born I'll show you where he said it was put in you before the foundation world see then we get it all figured out we know all about this this seed of that what good is a seed without moisture come on we're farmers we're old people we plant food we plant graves with like corn with what good is any seed you put in the ground without moisture the Lord Jesus sowed the seed come on is that the parable the children of the kingdom or the seed of God that Jesus Christ showed the children of the devil were the ones that the devil showed are we still in the Bible Lee well yeah we we want different that see we want to that we want to try to get something to make this thing feel good don't you worry about it just getting the word the older it gets it don't feel quite as good as you stir so there's a lot of us on the downhill drag right being plain sorry but it's the best way to say it listen what was the life stock that we had brother branham said it will read it from Christ mister God reveal that God in the back part of his mind he had a plan in the purpose now he said in the back part of his mind see then in your human mind you have conscious subconscious and really you have an unconscious we don't we'll deal with that unconscious because it's not much to understand we have enough trouble with the conscious and the unconscious on see you how things that you dream dreams you're in a subconscious on point you know you dream dreams those are real to you but you have a natural knowledge out here well I now remember how we were trying to bring it out if I don't get any more I'll get this point you remember how we were trying to bring it out to life's message I doubt if any of yous went back and listened to it because you didn't care what I said that time you don't care what I say to not show you're not going to listen to it anyway I'm sorry but that's playing what you see God evidently if he made man in His image and likeness sometimes who must be pretty close the simulation every what you call it you know he looks like and everything it works right and see God has us two parts of his mind you remember how we're trying to bring that out one part of God's mind it knows everything that's taking place right he knows every now he knows everything you know he's ever moving over everything and that's part of his mind and he knew that before the world right and he could predetermine by what we would choose correctly but what about the Bible that keeps saying you didn't choose me I chose you and ordained you what about which one was it was Jeremiah the Prophet he said I saw you and ordained you I'm quoting scripture before the world ever begun those prophets were predestinated now listen so then think about it we relay so much own wording there's human terminologies when we have to use it but that's why I love the Bible in the way it would do because it'll say something about God created this or created the world whatever you know what that has a beginning because he created it if he created it the word created mean it had a beginning but when he come to man he said let us make man then use the word creator Genesis 1:26 and 27 huh he said let us make man instead he made man in His image long if you remember the thoughts we were trying to bring out that God anything he creates is the beginning it has a beginning with anything that's a part of him doesn't have a beginning so what we got to do we got to find out some way to get back far enough to find out some way that we can be a part of him is that planning out and you know you don't go back there to find it you know where you go you go right in the altar and find your new birth you'll find your Newburg puts you to the right place now quote from spoken words original seed butter run said it have borne that away by the words of spirit he said takes you back like it was in the beginning and this is words he said he said I'd never seen that before someone spoken word for it no seed he called it right then it would put us back like the original like we should have been we'll get to those things as we come down under talking about when we get to the creation of mankind and and get to the creation of the world and the things like that but just remember when he created the world it had a beginning he created a lot it had a beginning he created animals it had a beginning then he said let us make man you say let us create man looks like me now then there would be a part of God's mind that would know all about the world and all the things and everything that would ever take place and how you would create and what he would do and he'd know if every person had ever come into the world and why it would be but then in the back part of his mind he would be dwelling with his thoughts alone is that Elohim the self existing one who dwelt along with his thoughts see if you can see how that you're a part of God you see you didn't have no beginning then it won't be no problem for the Prophet to say you always was eternal all you got to do is get the right line up you don't have to rip out those pages you know how to do it like a man told me one time he's telling me he said certain part of the Bible he said in order be tore up this coat out I said give me a Bible I was gonna turn it out if it ain't no good tired out well he wouldn't do it well there should be a lot of our ideas may over be taught and thought out but make a simple little point this is as simple it is anything that's created has a beginning come on revelation 3:14 they said he's the beginning of the creation of God you know who that's talking about Jesus Christ when he come into human flesh you know what is human flesh at a beginning right so he's the beginning of the creation of God he began he was created in the wound of a Virgin Mary of creation but the God that dwelled in that body it's why I read the fullness of the Godhead bodily dwell in him see that soul in that spirit of Almighty God that came into that body that was the little baby we call Jesus had no beginning and had no ending it was always eternal because it was eternal God there's no beginning to the eternal God so if you can see you're a part of God then you can understand why the Prophet would say you always was eternal and then turn around till you receive eternal life at the altar then turn around tell you you must be born again because you're not born again you're going to die and go to hell see then that was the point of trying to get of what that garden his mind could think of everything he could write the book of life he could run all the way but you know there's more in the book a lot because that's why that I'm in Phatak Lee stated to it said it we call it the book of life that the Bible doesn't say the book a lot the Bible says the book of the life of the Lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world because if you're saying book of life your name can be in the book of life and Judas Iscariot's name was in the book of life and removed from the book of life which you cannot remove a name from the book of the life of the Lamb that was slain because that's his children you realize when people that watch on judgment you believe that there will be a white throne judgment you believe there will be people giving eternal life it to watch their own judgment do you believe that you know what that's impartation that's not a child of God that's in partition that doesn't make them a child of God come on but to a born-again Christian they are a child of God why because they're his offspring is that what Paul said on Mars he'll when you got up there any got to looking around and seeing all these things in all the places all the little things and they have them laid for everybody and this in case they miss one to that little box maybe sitting there and it said to the unknown God Paul said I just like to talk to y'all a little bit about that he said I like to talk to you about the unknown God you know what he preached Jesus Christ to those people and he said even your poets say it says that we are his offspring he realized that not if you're a born-again Christian with the baptism of the Holy Ghost eternal life in your soul that you're just as eternal in soul if God ever was because God life is in you because life is in you make your life eternal let's see we want to come into the world with eternal life where we don't have to worry about it then we want the evidence that I believe everything cause I believe the message right well tell me where the Prophet said itself I didn't think he said it was what do you believe the message or not I thought he said it's the fact of whether or not the spirit in you agrees with the word ah that's the same time then you don't know that ain't exactly the same time a little different there see the proof of the new birth is whether or not what's in you agrees with the word if it don't agree with the word then it's not of God right what you see if we only go back to pre destinations or the foreknowledge is in pre determining by foreknowledge ease and say we're only dealing with the part of God's mind that knows everything because at the same time that he predestinated you by foreknowledge he predestinated Judas before knowledge right cause he predestinated everything by foreknowledge his foreknowledge was worst that he could determine it but the problem would say God knew you and wanted and said he'd haven't here for you because he knew you'd wanted at the same time he knew you'd wondered he knew others would want it for a little while and go with it for a little while and be borderline believers and things like that and go along for a while but eventually would go away why because since the character of life in this setting the other takes it away the toy and the time is I'm am i still quoting scriptures from Matthew Mark Luke and John you see why I asked you a few months ago read Matthew Mark Luke and John over and over and over and over you ever want to know anything that rose they will tell you to read read Matthew Mark Luke and John that was a lifetime I the thing I talked to Ricky for Bush before he passed away that was a last thing I told I said Ricky don't try to figure out and read the Book of Revelations to try to figure out what this is or Daniel or these books or that book stay away from that I said get simply in Matthew Mark Luke and John and start reading from Matthew Mark Luke and John and I said you'll come out with the right guy not because we want to understand all these great things and say that's evidence of the Holy Ghost according to my understanding the Bible says you can have all wisdom to know all mystery but have not eternal love right do you see what I'm driving at see with with the part of God's mind is that as far as we can go back we've done a wonderful job and don't discounted that it took me 40 something years to try to bring what I'm talking about I preached up to it and see it preached up to it see it preach it and try to bring it keep trying to climb higher and higher and higher 40 something years I've been preaching on predestination I was thinking today about it work that the first sermon I preached in this message with 1969 in Athens Georgia but there's no there's people sitting here that was out of that day but they wouldn't recognize and understand that we this is maybe even of it but does that mean I didn't do it because about 30 years ago I'll take you from about the police it was mentioned 30 years ago you know make it one out 40 what you see I saw Jesus Christ and I taught then that the bride of Jesus Christ would be the son of man the Word made flesh in a group of people not in this brother branham brother Branham was not the son of man brother Branham is not the one standing in Revelations one where it says he's go about the pouch with a golden girdle standing in the seven golden candlesticks that your prophet said was the bride but you see you say well I say something like that you just say what he just trying to do no I'm trying to tell you what God has been doing he's been trying to reveal himself to his people but they won't listen they got it figured out this way or that away or it's going to be here going to be that we're going to have it by certain president we don't have it by somebody at one we're told finally getting the White House we're gonna make it tell me that in the Bible according to my Bible she's been in the White House all along is that right you want to go to revelation 17 the old mother and the harlot daughters because the first thing I done when I come into this message and I heard brother Brown talking about how the Catholic would worm its way into the White House you know what I done I got all the books I could get everything I could get and I wrote it in front of my Bible at somewhere but they were that was 19 in 67 66 or 67 at that time it was about eleven or twelve hundred Catholics already in the White House see when he said times I wanted to see it I'm not interested in him coming after all because I know what I'm interested it it says when you see Jerusalem compassed about we're over here Russia's over here turn it over here there there when you see that that's what the Bible says listen Church I'm just trying to get you to see something to profit from Chrysler mysteries it back in the back part of God's mind why would you go to the back part and why would he say in Christ the mystery let's see do you remember it he said what about knowing that's all alone in not being able to try to explain it in other words it's in Christ mystery he said he knew it all alone but couldn't bring it to the people what about it why did he know all along I thought - mr. cross the mystery of God revealed was that God entered his mind a plan and a purpose if he was planning on accomplishing and you know what he said alpha-1 message this is when I love you know what he said off of the message masterpiece if you had something in his mind he wanted to display he said it was to make man in his own image you need to read that that's what he had in his mind my brother Dale the Chrysler mister God revealed is a great mixture the Seventh Seal well evidently that must be what the Seventh Seal did because that's what he explained you want to read a little bit of it let's just read some of it because see you get the point of one Gumba I'm not talking about God he's got a split mind he's doing this and he's doing that it's illustrating that God knows everything but then he can back up further than just his own foreknowledge he so know you can't go back face your own foreknowledge you can if you turn around and walk back with the one that does the thinking that's what I've always told you I don't want to be just what God thinks huh I want to be part of his mind I want what Paul said that the mind of Christ you said would regret avail the Bible says our mind our cry to make a new creature that's a new creation praise God because he we was lost and he had to change things but when he made Adam he made him different he made Adam in his own image that was a spiritual man that he made right what about it what are we looking at let's go ahead some let's take up a few of these but whoever's on the pole biker today I've been giving you some you've been getting you some relaxed time you hadn't been running out having to keep up let's go to Christ mr. God reveal paragraph 102 let's just see well they're getting onto it and bringing it up huh God a secret mystery he had before the world begun now back in the back part of God's mind there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve right he had a motive in doing it what was his motive in order to let himself be express express his attributes right look at Aetna second right because first there wasn't even a Moonstar atom molecule or anything he was God but he actually wasn't God at that time because God is an object of worship and there was nothing was nothing to worship him so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be displayed not you better be expressed you better listen and follow me for a second okay so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed in him was loved and him was to be father in him was to be son I can understand father I can understand healer I can understand Savior but what about in him was to be something what what's the key in him was to be son she then before the world ever begun you've got the word shun but remember anything had a beginning has an ending the word shun had no beginning you buddy such a son it sounds kind of have a beginning not the way God done it that's why the son the logos the word the thought the speech is what created all things the father never created nothing show me show me the message show me the Bible where the father created anything now the son created but remember now we're not being no co-equal and coeternal in the Trinity sometimes we're in the line of her right so the father became the son it could be father because he created man he could be son and Savior true but the main thing is he's son in creation come on hebrews 1 says Jesus Christ created all the time Colossians 1 says he quit Oh John 1 we just read city created and I believe it's James 3 and 9 said all things were made by Jesus Christ and without him there was not anything made that was made so now we've done established a doctrinal issue of a thought just because you call him son don't make him a heaven in the beginning remember you are the sons and daughters of the Living God by the new word right you now know beginning what it took to make you eternal to be a son of God and know beginning there's an impartation god just stepped over in another phone you were to read real slow sometimes and think about what you read and him was to be son and him would to be savoring him which will be healer all these great attributes that we see already expressed they were in God go ahead to the next paragraph 105 Christ the mystery of God reveal God had a purpose and a hidden mystery and that's what I want to speak on to the church this morning the hidden mystery of God that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how that is unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living see then you will understand clearly then you see on I believe what is being done it's still going on you realize every time a newborn baby comes into Christ God is still dividing himself when that newborn child amount of 80 years old 30 years old you know what I mean anybody receiving the new birth God is still giving his eternal life like brother Moke said don't worry about like a knife or you cut it up and you give out your pieces and you end up with it just remember as much as you cut up God and try to get him out there going to be that much more for him to give away that's why that devil wouldn't smart if that devil had just stayed where he's at to kill Jesus hung him on a cross for told him in a tune that didn't do no good by doing that he had 120 Jesus's to face he ought to left them alone but he getting right outside they went there was 3,000 more little Jesus's he'd have been smart if he did just went on to his self and stayed there he can't do it he's a destroyer okay sorry let's go to the next one but let's see what he wanted to make huh the masterpiece he don't want Michelangelo and reading to the Great's culture who before there was a world he's coming to Christ right and for the foundation was laid he had in his mind what he wanted now what did he want what did God want well he wanted a whirl he wanted to do this and he wanted to do that and he wanted to build this and he wanted to do all of this at the other he wanted to make man in his own image where he could fellowship with him now come on church God can't fellowship with a devil children he will annihilate him but he can fellowship with his own children and he will never annihilate them because look what he's saying he wanted to make man in his own image that was his whole purpose Genesis 1:26 and 27 now as I said let us make man he wanted to make something in reality of what was a vision to him what was in his thinking what was a part of him he wanted to bring into being what was a part of him we only think about father and in this out of the other and we think about it as a healer Redeemer etc right that's what we think about when we think about attributes which just remember now hope vertebra know that God dwelt alone with his attributes there was his children yeah but now you've got something before the world we known all along Ian's don't finally say it well praise God I hope he did cuz I've been saying it for forty something here I'm just glad you finally caught up to listen God's planning purpose is not to have all of mankind and the seeing in the world and all of the situation's he's planned what to have people to come into being he didn't have to be a father to him he was her father he didn't have to be a healer he was the healer he never gained an attribute by coming into the world all those attributes he had he's all free he wanted to bring into being his children well now you're making something I correct I'm not making nothing back there I'm telling you the other part of God's mine first part all mankind involved everybody all over the world everything predestination it all involves praise God we finally got that figured out and what about backing up in his mind to her that Jesus told us a sample I'll get to these later he said I had fellowship with you before the foundation of the world well I just back in his foreknowledge you're cutting yourself short you don't understand the Bible you're dying right there because that's exactly as far as mankind even in this message has been able to go it's foreknowledge to go back to get back to God thinking you don't hear anybody preaching that they know what to me just something anything that they want to be part of the tinkerer gets eternal life to be part of the very one that done the thinking because if it just is thinking he thought of a lot of people that'll never get eternal life he thought of a lot of people at the white throne that will be given eternal life but none of that is your children and don't forget what I said to start with we come into this world lost 10 folks to the devil you've got to have the new birth for God to transmit that eternal life into you to give you eternal life what I always works I'll talk to prophet out always worthy come what are you gonna do with it I'm showing you what you want to call it a contradiction you want to call it that I say it's not I said it's God's honest truth but one time in the Bible the Bible says that we are the sons of God they're not appear yet what would be we said when the in fear will be like him then another Bible says we were all lost doomed and on the way to hell now is that a contradiction you're making it one by your thinking see if you can allow it we'll get back to that if you allow it to come to a basis that one day we'll get out of heaven with this thing come to down towards the earth and start talking about sometimes because see when God created Adam he created a special man because he created a man that he wanted according the blasphemous names brother Branham said it Adam had eternal life especially he breathed into Adams nostrils a breath of eternal life well let let poor Eve out well then you're going to have to handle some more because brother Branham says that Adam was lonely because part of him was still left in theophany so he had to bring even to be okay you see what I'm doing I got a quote he wrote around and said I'm not doing this to try to see I'm not trying to do doing this to try to produce dr. drew I'm trying to do this to straighten out doctrine he said it's wonderful because I've told you not you do what you want to for 40 years I've been driving at one time trying to get you and me to see who we are and our purpose for being here and what's taking place trying to get you to see who you are what I'm a child of God because I predestinated back there God knew I'd want to be safe so he predestinated me to be safe now wrote around says you're wrong he said God never predestinated by his desires till now for all your desires out you see one of these days you're going to understand a little message your prophet brought to you it's called an unconditional covenant Ibraheim never even had a new birth and yet he got an unconditional covenant you see we're leaving those messages out we push them aside because we don't want to handle that you say how do you know we do that because that's what I've always done I don't mind telling you there's a lot of the messages I have to push aside they've bred a random talk time because I don't know what he's talking about I can't put it together so if I can't put it together I'll leave it alone but then after a while here coming home from the work to me and I always come through the scriptures and he'll open the scriptures you take quotes quotes quotes you can quote yourself to death in this message or you quote yourself to death in the Bible but when it comes together in brains eternal life who's going to worry about quoting what what did he say he said God wanted to create a man that's his whole goal that some cry semestre go read it over and over and over God's whole goal was to bring man into the world it would be his children not just to bring people into the world now listen I don't mean to go this way but it's going intellectual to many weeks of not preaching I guess dirty if bother there's a lot of people caught it on the preach that don't mean cuz it piled up so much I can't preach but you see if all we can go is back to pre destinations and for knowledge we're only looking at half the story because you're not seeing his plan and purpose you're thinking his plan and purpose was to create mankind well how come he created some right or something wrong you've got to go with that see you're not thinking you're just going back to a point that we've got it favored brother Dale I thought I had it figured out I've heard you say that foreknowledge is first and predestination comes after foreknowledge and elections and the things involved and said I thought I finally had it figured out now you done blowed my mind because you don't want that page for knowledge why not we're here we go into the back part of God's mind by way of the Prophet messenger and why can't we see the morning Sarge we're staying together and the sons of God were shouting for joy well that was just in God's mind oh that's wonderful I gave you the quote from brother branham and got it laying here if you wanted brother Brown who said what is when the morning stars sang together under guard shot it with your he said how do you know that that would when they seen the plan of salvation would then is one thing for certain those that saw that back gar saw the plan of salvation before we ever made one step this way well you just put it out there we like these other brothers because they they come through and they say things we can understand them praise God when you think I can get them to try to help you it's about time to quit playing with sugar tits too and start believing what God says the prophet of God said it over and over you know it he said you always was eternal now what's he talking about what do you talk about always why'd he come he said you wouldn't save don't know certain day he said she was always saved did you say what I say george'll he said according to the Bible you're saved before the foundation of the world what about it church which ought to understand you you know when you say you don't understand me I know one thing for certain and you're going to like this really good you'll go ahead and boil out a little bit get it done but I'll get that patents for them where you'd go roll it up and pout it but you know the reason you don't understand me maybe it's cause you don't talk to the same God I talk to have I ever brought you anything that wasn't in the message you have a right to come and show me have I ever brought you anything that wasn't according to what the Prophet said you have a right to come and show me why would a prophet say you needed to be born again but say you always was eternal I start sensible but you know what that means I know you're gonna like it better okay you know what that means that means acts 2:38 comparable Matthew 28:19 are you listening we had Matthew 28:19 in acts 2:38 as a direct contradiction in the Bible and would not listen to being baptized the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right cold we had father-son oligo cuz everybody else that father son and holy God so when the Prophet says you need to be born again and then turned around and says you always was eternal you got a contradiction if you don't know the answer and remember you're going to talk among yourself about what I'm saying you always do instead of coming to me just remember you've got to let me sit right there and can't hear a thing did you notice the other day when I said it and I kept turning back wait called it he song kept turning back somebody was sitting our texting at the same time on your telephone now if that can be done I would think a little bit about the Word of God I'm not playing trying to build character or anything I'm trying to get you to see one thing God and had in his mind that he was going to bring his children into be you mean God had children come on are you that blind the Baptist knows God has children are you that blind who are we the only way you can be a child of God is to be born again what you see we segment but now listen what is that what would it make us be in that let's read a couple then we'll quit ok give me a few more minutes ok while are getting number six I'll quote number five to you from the message what does it take to make a Christian life God had in his mind what to do now listen but when he expressed it it had to come into existence he listened to that he had in his mind what he wanted to do but he expressed it and it come into existence okay let's just see what this would make us to be let's see number six yep and knoweth it not you talking about you've come over here in this little inside man they talk about and you how to be foreordained because you was with God you're a part of God now he's explaining a prophet in his ways of actions and doing okay our gifts and the way they operate okay he said I was in my father I was in my grandfather and my great-grandfather grandfather by seed I was in that I was in Christ you were in Christ before the foundation of the world he came to redeem his own his own that was in him hallelujah his children that was in him never he never came to save the devil's children they all know they never will know it they are so shrewd in the ways or their intellectual learning that you can't compile with them at all you cannot talk them but by faith you see it not the devil's children God didn't come to save them he come to save his own children what about it who are the ones that are going to be in this group that you're talking about go ahead number seven now who is this Melchizedek paragraph 115 look he's coming down explaining the sisal to show the germ to thing shows plainly the predestinated is the only one that's considered in Redemption Devil's children's not in redemption to impart eternal life to anybody to watch on is not Redemption that's just him giving eternal life to for some reason what the other one is considered in Redemption did you get it let me say that again the predestinate is the only one that's considered in Redemption people might be making like think they are but the real redemption is those that are predestinated because the very word redeem means to bring back is that right the redeem is something to redeem anything is bring it back to its original place hallelujah so it's only the predestinated that would be brought back because the others didn't come from dark what's the dark you got to predestinated group of people then you got something didn't come from dire they didn't come from where the predestinate people come from is that sensible right now watch what he says being eternal with him at the beginning the eternal life that you had his thought of what you was only he wanted you to he wanted me to stand the pulpit that he wanted me to sit in the seat tonight then we are serving his eternal purpose and remember it is not the person 150 for church age book we got it it's in here it's not the person that comes free that's innate eternally from God it's the word or seed not this and when you hear where he says oh that's fine we're going down to it who is this Melchizedek notice those who have tonight eternal life was with him and in him and his thinking before there ever was and for there ever was an angel sure of him anything else that's eternal you have eternal life you always was not your being here with the shape and form that the infinite God not this that's where the trouble that that's why the predestination theories are what they are that's why in the organizations that were that that's why you bad this split over predestination it wasn't just a lot of the others a Baptist doctor split with two brothers I'll come out of there two brothers split the Baptist Church over predestination we'll see what is predestination well I don't I know I'm not too good a person but if I was back there I'm predestinated backward well always was eternal see there's the problem you got the Baptist doctrine was called to seeds in the spirit that's a Baptist doctrine called to seeds in the spirit almost identical calling it two souls two seeds in the spirit that was her doctor and the people of this message what if I come with a seed in me if I come with this seed in me what seed did you come with some seed in you that the other person didn't come with a seed in them you've gotten God respect to a person now you're out you've got him a respect to a person you got any money you're out you're off the message but if you give everybody a change on this side on predestination then you can go according to predestination but I'm not talking about that we're ending this tonight bringing I'm talking about back before the foundation all this one more metric I got one more I got to bring that we were chosen in him Lord willing we'll bring Sunday we were chosen in him he chose us we didn't choose him oh I saw God I thought God the Bible says no man so God at any time but I don't understand you cuz I cryed and I done this trying to find another quote coworking the end owner you see Church all I want to be is to be a part of God is that your desire I'm as honest that I can be in straight Blaine talking I'm not interested in going to heaven I come out here about 20 30 years ago preach the sermon I said from now on I have no interest in going to heaven I said I don't mean now if I die where I'm going to want to do it I'm just trying telling you that heaven is supposed to come here according to the Bible everything comes here we don't go down if you're gonna do anything gonna meet him up in the air we're all of us here that's why this is the center of the universe is this earth cause this is where God makes his headquarters this is where the future home is going to be set in I want him to come here and see that's why I tried my best to get you for 40 years over one time your prophet said the seventh seal is the coming of the Lord that right go home and look up the word come it has nothing to do without darkness it means the word coming I can go into a lot of things with it belong but it literally means to be right here embraced in the arms of the Lord Jesus Christ then when he comes here to take our star the word come means to be here not in travel not you going it means to be here your prophet said one day they'll come such a baptism of the Holy Ghost then it'll fill every fiber of our being and take us in the rapture it's coming here he's going are you crazy listen a preacher don't go to heaven you don't even know what I say it you ain't listening you just listening to word and go ahead but think about it let me give you one more where you won't think I'm wrong on it you're a part of God that's all that I want to be okay brothers let's go to 13 eight single have jumped now I list mine and unless one two three so we're going over 13 a and it's off the message Jesus Christ the same they said that man's belly bub look when the light flash across that little predestinated see now you know he talked about the woman well the woman run come on place across that little predestinated cedar she had her seed praise God when it struck that real seat of God that was before the foundation of the world probably name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life when it struck that quickly she recognized it in her condition she recognized it really I say that woman knows more about God right then than half the people in the United States and she recognized why she was ordained before the foundation of the world when that light struck it now one minute listen when that predestinated seed was made alive to the little woman at the well did it give her eternal life right there you just read from your prophet does it was struck to life did she get eternal life no because Jesus hadn't died yet the seed was made alive of who he was come on I can say all that now if you want to to Moses when that light struck Moses it never gave him eternal life but he gave him the revelation of the one burning at the burning bush it was the I am that I am you can have the seed made alive to you of many things if the seat was made alive - - Abel it was quicker than made alive - Abel of the blood being the atonement that didn't give him eternal life see that's where you want to just run with anything you want to it didn't give that little woman at the well eternal life she had to go to Calvary she was probably in the upper room I think she was I don't see no reason why she wouldn't have been there but she never got any turn alive when that light was struck now you're reading your prophet and you listen to it he'll say that seed was laying there and the light struck it and it come to life he'll say eternal life with a woman that dwell never got eternal Island but she got to eternal life a few days later but a random said she had representation from predestination he said the Pharisees didn't have it do you understand making just that point that we think because it was struck whether I gave you all these copper red atoms said Moses was struck a lot Amen but it never gave him eternal eyes because you've got eternal life in people before Calvary and you can't have it except to one man Adam will cover him Sunday good Adam did have eternal life that was God's program and God's ordained way it should have come okay we'll leave that alone okay so look what he says now going to the Nexen 13b going to 13b and he you're supposed to hit it still on its on Christ miss your God reveal you can't commit adultery you're already pregnant what's he talking about the new birth right glory you can't take it hold the wound of life is close to anything else you're already here's my predestination that seed has come to life no world can get it oh how we'd like to stay on this for about an hour I'm sure you understand see Christ and his alone already finished the seed was there the seed was already when was it foot died before the foundation of the world has predestinated us unto eternal life and as soon as the life-giving flow that seed laying down other seeds it won't take hold where we succeed puttin you before the foundation world not in predestination you're gonna have to back up into the God's mind or else you're gonna have him choosing come on now I'm saying that come on listen if you say well that was just back before the foundation world when in God's mind he was rolling doing it then you're having him choosing because he's speaking out we want you say well you sure sound like you're choosing no I'm not there was no choosing to that seed the seeds is what comes predestinate eternally from God there's no choosing on the seed you didn't choose to receive a seed when it says there in the beginning what I'll put enmity between thy seed and the seed of the woman that seed was Jesus Christ okay one more come on decisions one more crisis a mystery of garden let's see now we're on microscopy go to the next one which would be 13b my cry sneaker see the seed of God is actually placed in us from the foundation of the world and when that light strike first strikes that seed it brings its life the Verte the light first has to come upon the seat okay now listen if it was put there before the foundation of the world then the Bible's right when it said the morning stars sang together the sons of God shouted for joy then the Bible is right when it says the things were written in the book of the life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world now you going on back into the mind of God and we'll take a pickup Sunday where it says we were chosen in him it's not whether or not I've been chosen it matters because my goodness can't put me into heaven but it's according if he was chosen we say well we know for sure he will be that's right if he was chosen we were children you ain't never listened to the Prophet when he'd say when he walked the shores of Galilee I was in him said when he went to Calvary I was in said when he went to hell I was in he said when he raised I raised in him not important what that we think of predestination the importance is whether or not he chose us you said yeah I accepted God I accepted God that was one that really told me you know the quote I'm going to run around him later statement he said you accept he'd gone that's right he said but did God accept you well wait he said if I'd repent and I believe and be baptized and he saved me yeah and then you go back live like a devil proven it's a long way it goes to show he didn't accept you you might have accepted him but he didn't accept you but when you accept you he's gonna come and live in you and when he comes and lives in you you ain't gon live like a devil right so we're gonna try to find now to get out of heaven but I hope you understand he didn't listen to the message tonight I got the quotes are laying the Prophet said if you wasn't in him before the foundation the world you never will be but said if you was in him they ain't enough for Devils inhale to stop you what about it then go ahead what we got let's take 15 15 [Music] in that
