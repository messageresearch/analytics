have it in its fullness like we do in the end time god bless you good to be in the house of the lord again good to have each and every one of you here with us and thank you for being a tentative this morning we uh that was dad's two brothers and uh that was the that was the rest of the family so that's the two three boys is all that's left and daddy's the baby so um marshall has met the preacher for a long time and john's been in and out of church all of its life so they uh told me the other day that was going to come by and see us and i said i'll believe it when i see it so i guess i better believe it because we saw it and we had witnesses so that's good you never know never know who you can touch when you come to the house with laura so remember now brother aaron will be speaking for us wednesday uh terence and lisa and the boys will be in hilton head probably till next sunday uh the sign up sheets downstairs for the putt-putt so make sure you sign up for that who all wants to go also remember brother aaron glover will be here september 25th 26th and there's something we need to pray about um brother richard and the tech guys are getting screens that we can put them up here or tv screens and i i i hope the walls don't fall down in this church but let's pray that they get another television so it's not we don't pray for tvs but but we need another screen we've got one back here in the office and they keep delaying and delaying and even richard comes up here two or three times they say yep we're going to deliver it on tuesday because we need two of them we need one over here and one over here so that you over here can see that way and you over here can see this way and we're gonna put them in you know on the wall but we need two of them we've got one it's been here for three months since may so we need to pray that the church gets a television that's what i said kind of hard kind of hard to say that but uh we need a tv screen it's too big to be a monitor this thing's 70 something inches big so it's it's uh for the older ones in the group that can't see very well amen so just pray that they send the thing richard he they called him the other day and they delayed it again said something happened in the warehouse and there's something wrong here i just laid my hands on the tv just a few minutes ago and i said look we need the other one lord so we can get these things on the screen we don't have to pull this thing up and down anymore and uh it'll make it a lot easier so let's pray that we get that thing in okay also remember i remember i forgot to give this to bob about that little girl named angie that's getting bullied at school and she's wanting to take her own life so we know we know the devil would love to do that but you know we know a god is greater than the devil amen so those things are real too there's people that you know they the um the bullying part of school uh when we were growing up it was bad and kind of people just kind of overlooked it but but you get now to this age of neurotic people and this taking nothing's to take a life anymore they just they just think they can do whatever they want to so let's just pray that that little child as we did this morning just keep her in your prayers and harmony and you can keep us updated on it okay all right keep us updated you pray with her you you go by just if she's not a friend you just you know what just pat her on the back say hey everything's gonna be okay that's that transfer of faith you know lay your hands everything will be okay i'll pray with you if you want me to out of the mouth of babes right amen all right so let's bow our heads and we'll get started we'll try to uh get to a point this afternoon this morning obviously i had to i had to back up a bunch and uh and try to make sure that everybody understood what was going on but um we'll try to get into the millennium tonight this afternoon so we'll see so let's bow our heads do heavenly father thank you for this day that we're living we ask you lord that you would come among this service be the active participant lord you've you've been in the song service lord and the people lord have sung the songs of zion we've done the things that we needed to do lord to get the anointing here now pray lord that you'll be with each one anoint us all for this time of service lord forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes that we make against you thank you for touching all of our bodies lord we ask you for this little girl named angie lord that you'll truly again just cover it by your holy spirit and just give whoever's doing the bullying lord don't don't give them a hard time just make them have a sweet spirit just give them a sweet spirit lord that they'll they'll it'll contradict that thing that wants to rise up in them to be a bully and let it be lord taken away from them father we know they don't mean it we know it's the devil motivating so we pray in the name of the lord jesus that you'll help that situation lord bless this day that we're in father give us strength bless our pastor keep him strong bless each one that's here lord in the sound of my voice and the ones lord that are sitting at home father we pray that you give each one today a blessing because we truly believe that we are heading toward a millennium lord it's going to be a thousand years of just something we can't even if we spent years and years and years we could not um tell the people how glorious it's going to be the bible says i have not seen and near hath not heard what's entered into the hearts of man according to the bible lord we're going to live with you for a thousand years and that's not even that's just going to be the beginning then we go into a future home lord we pray that you'd be with each one father be your brother royal and the different ones lord in the foreign countries the ones in afghanistan and also the ones that are now dealing with these mudslides and all the rain and here even in the united states there's people dying of floods and different things lord we pray that you just protect your bride be with humanity lord they need you we know one day lord for a surety there's going to be a wrath poured out on this nation in this world that we don't want to be here lord so we pray that every time with the lord that we speak behind this desk lord that someone will come to you father and they'll know you as their personal savior lord and give their heart to you lord so they don't they don't have to go through that that they'll be lifted up above that and you said come up hither and lord we'll be in another dimension with you father and they'll do what they will on this earth man will destroy each other and be and just be at each other's throat but lord we will be in a place of safety because of the choices we make on this side father just give us this day our daily bread in jesus name we pray amen hebrews 9 11 says but christ being coming high priest of good things to come by a greater more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us in revelations 11 3 and i will give power to my two witnesses and they shall prophesy one thousand two hundred three score day clothed in sackcloth i think we covered that pretty good this morning so we may just skip through some of this but i want to get to two points that i left out because the company was here and that made they may not have understood so let's go to isaiah 65 verse 17. for behold i create new heavens i want you to watch how that says that all right the bible is written specifically right it all it has a purpose now remember in revelations 21 when we get to the future home it'll say a new heaven and a new earth this says new heavens and a new earth everybody got that because that is specific over there the future home this is going to be in the millennium where there's going to be layers and layers of heavens we'll get to it maybe not today but you i like when when we read that isaiah 65 66 and the different one says heavens but when you get revelations 21 create a new heaven and a new earth all right and the former things will be passed away so the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind and before you all sit down i want you all to take a look over to your right and look at this beautiful group of people now not brother donnie but this beautiful group of ladies standing up here that's your future amen they all pretty much play instruments and they sing and they do the things and they're sitting up here in the front while you couldn't get me to sit in the front at that age for nothing in the world but thank god that they're able to i know even though we told them they had to but i'm just kidding they they sat there they're on the court y'all got to find you another place when i start sitting back over there oh okay all right well y'all can be seated thank you for y'all okay i'll say it with paul no i'll say paul said i can sit with him so y'all can sit over there huh uh-huh yeah freddy you stand listen me and june hadn't sat together in years and mom and daddy they just look 60-something years they never sat together now they're sitting together it's been 60-something years they don't sit together during the service it's a distraction if we can't laugh would cry so anyway so let's go to matthew 16 real quick um brother anderson are you in the back yeah we're going to skip over a little bit of this that we covered today and the reason i said pray about the television if y'all can't turn this back off turn it down you can't can y'all see that those little white spots are getting worse and worse and then finally this thing's going to go out this projector's losing some of its bits and it looks kind of like the it was kind of like constellations no that's not what it is but now it looks more like the milky way and then we're going to get into like the nebula and it's going to get worse and worse so we need to get rid of this thing it served its purpose and get those screens but that's why we put that black screen up so some of you in the back won't be able to see it but some up in the front in the front you definitely can see it looks like a bunch of stars done it you could do the constellations because i can see orion's belt right there listen god's first bible was where in the heavens and the stars all right so maybe we'll get back to that but not right now so let's go to matthew 16 verse 15 and brother richard and them have worked diligently to try to get the uh they're trying to update and get uh new cameras um and everything made into high definition so that we'll have the best brother brown said you should always have the best amen so now let's look at this because i want to cover this this point and then we'll move on because we used this the other day and brother russ called me and we were talking about this and it really helped him so let's read it and then let me make a comment that i didn't make this morning he saith unto them but who says who do you say that i am and simon peter said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and sent unto him blessed art thou simon bar jonah for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church in other words upon this revelation of the son of god i'll build my church we read the quote where brother ryan said he built his church on the revelation of the son of god he said i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against him all right so let's go to the next part where it says son of man because that's what we were wanting to cover this morning and i kind of skipped through that but look if you'll take this and and you'll see the virgins and you'll see the wives you see the foolish and what brother russ and i were talking about but the son of man and i kind of hit it briefly the other day but the son of god revelation will put you in the bride everybody got that so we'll do this real quick so son of god revelation is when you bow your head and say god forgive me of my sins and you go through justification sanctification the baptism of holy ghost you become a newborn baby in christ amen okay you become a newborn babe all right but you don't become a fully mature christian until you go up the statue of a perfect man and you add this and you add this then you add this everybody got that amen you're not no less a child of god when you get born again you're born again you're a child of a god but there are positions in different well the bible calls them but it's really you're not going to have a stack of crowns on your head it's going to be an honor bestowed upon you or something given to you that god's going to give you like god gives us certain gifts he did not give me a gift to sing or to play an instrument but he gave you all gifts to do those things so it's like a gift that god gives you so the wise virgins here's the point the wise virgins are under this son of god revelation everybody got that they received they had oil all right so that's down to the church ages now what about the foolish virgins they're not part of this the foolish virgin is not part of this building of my church because they're not part of his church everybody got that the foolish virgins did not get the holy ghost now they may be sitting in the church but jesus ain't talking about sitting in my church he said i'll build i'll build my church on the son of god revelation but it will end on the son of man revelation where we look at the alive and remain that's what me and brother russ is talking about that's the mystery of god is the son of god revelation will put you in the kingdom everybody got there in the kingdom in the my church part or in the bride but it doesn't guarantee you to be part of the son of man revelation the son of man revelation is when paul says we which are alive and remain are behold i show see here's the mystery we shall not all sleep that's the son of man revelation that's the complete revelation of the son of man when the headstone comes to me and you that's the complete revelation of god and that's where the son of man revelation is is that he lie alive and remain so there's a group of people that's not going to die and they can't do that under the son of god revelation because under the son of god revelation sure it puts you in in the body of christ it helps you to grow but it doesn't put you in a position to be the alive and remain all right so everybody got that so there's there's those different groups that you see the wise virgin foolish virgin is not part of building god's church now they may be support they may go to god's church but when he said i will build my church it will be the born-again believers that he's building nothing else now that doesn't say the foolish virgin is not going to make it to eternal the eternal home or the eternal part but they're not going to ever live in the city they're going to have to stay dead for a thousand years they're going to have to come up at the white throne judgment and stand before god and be judged by what they did do and did not do that scares me already right right but if you get born again and become a wise version you don't have to fool with any of that or worry with any of that food because it's foolish for this virgin so everybody got that i was going to try to cover that this morning but with the with the people here that i didn't think they'd understand so so we'll get through we're done through that so now let's go if you don't if you don't mind brother anderson let's go to number one and it will be way on down past jeremiah we read revelation 6 12 today i skipped this quote i want to cover it there you go because i want to read you a scripture that i left out and that you don't have to pull it up but brother brown said notice there's a whole earth to be purged now see we we should we've already covered the two witnesses we've down to the battle of armageddon is everybody okay with that we're at the battle of armageddon notice there's a whole earth to be purged there will be such a thing that the moon stars and all nature will be purged see what it is the earth is renewing herself being purged getting ready for the millennium the millennium's coming and see everything that's got any filth in it is to be purged during the sixth seal now we know that sixth seal is the judgment seal and it is opened by the two prophets everybody got that say amen don't fall asleep on me already i'll be back there sitting with you all right this is important it's not important don't be here because the ones that don't think is important are not here but now look i want to go to where the prophet of god tells us watch this let's go to revelation see if you find revelations 11 14 no stop right there you're gonna have to find it and pull it up you're gonna work overtime today but this struck me the other day just go to revelations 11 try find 11 14. no it's going to be 11 14. i hit it it's hidden and revealed in simplicity but now look what brother brown said everything's got to be purged everything's purged during what the sixth seal all right so that's the that's the armageddon but i want you to see you say well well by the way that's the sixth seal that's right listen the seventh seal the prophet of god tells us that the seventh seal and the seventh trumpet are the same right so what is the seventh trumpet revelations 11 14. now listen six seals purge the earth a battle of armageddon happens everybody got that bell of armageddon kills everything off the earth all right so now watch so what would be the seventh seal would be us entering in because remember we're still in the seventh day in the millennium we'll read that in a minute it's not the eighth day there we go the second woe is past and behold the third woe which is the third war what's the third world war battle of armageddon the third war third woe cometh quickly revelations 11 15 and the seventh angel sounded and there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our lord and of his christ and he shall reign forever and ever everybody got that say amen see that look the seventh that's the seventh trumpet when the seventh trumpet opens is the same as the seventh seal to me and you now when is this going to happen the kingdoms of this world now what is going to be the millennium it's going to be 12 tribes with a kingdom set up jesus christ being the head of that kingdom and you and i are going to sit there with him but what's going to happen before that in our seventh seal is he's going to have to become the kingdoms of this world the kingdoms of this world are they can't become the kingdoms of our lord and of his christ and he shall reign for ever and ever but watch how this brings us on into the millennium and the four and 20 elders which sat before god on their seats fell upon their face and worshiped god saying we give thee thanks o lord god almighty which art and what it art to come because thou has taken to thee thy great power and hath reigned everybody got that so the seventh seal going into the millennium remember going into the millennium you had to have a sick seal to purge the earth right yeah i had to have a sick seal to purge the earth right amen not just not just sanctification like you got before when you stop doing this and stop doing that no no it's when the statue of perfect man comes and this kingdom is now body spirit and soul become the kingdoms of our lord because listen this is not the kingdom of god yet this was brought here by mama and daddy but it will be changed changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye it will be changed listen why is it going to be changed it's going to be changed because what's inside of you and i was praying this week and you know you yeah i'm feeling a lot better than i was last week thank the lord but you're gonna you're gonna have to fight your way through everything you do don't give up fight for every inch of ground if i go i want to go standing up with my boots on amen i mean really what are you going to do just lay there no and i said lord inside of me is the healer amen i have the new birth it's not just the holy ghost and that's it brother bryan said you get everything you need for your journey when you get the holy ghost now we know we got to grow though because a kid has everything every function that kid needs to be an adult has got it at a baby but you don't want to let them do adult things like drive a car and go to work no remember because so you got to grow and develop so i said lord that thing inside of me has got a healer in it let it out how many times have i told y'all we need to let out what we got inside of them it's been so encapsulated and so held together by unbelief and and and not having faith and not reading our bible as much as we should and not praying as much as we should but there it's already in there if you're born again amen the healer's already there you don't have to sometimes i think we pray and want god to come here i thought he always already was i thought when i got up in the morning he was there i'm just sleeping in my natural body god don't have to sleep listen that soul you got inside of you doesn't sleep why do you think you can think and you can do all these things when you're asleep because you got a person inside that's not asleep amen it's not even tired well i'll let that thing out please let the thing out i said lord that thing is inside of me as a healer let it come out and touch this guy right here let it touch this guy right here sure we like to call people we like to have somebody lay hands on us the man is already inside of you if you're born again just let it out i did i stood the other day and i said lord you're already here you're in here the kingdoms of this world have got to yield to what's inside of you already and let me tell you something it's going to yield to what's inside of you if you're not in the kingdom of god it's going to yield to you in the kingdom of the devil because you know what what's inside of you is going to determine what kingdom where you go anyway you're going to stay here and be destroyed by the kingdoms of this world are you going to take a rapture by the kingdoms of what christ yes kingdoms of our lord and his christ and he shall reign for ever another now when ever and ever now that was one i was going to cover this morning so now thank you for pulling it up brother brother anderson excuse me now let's go we know what jacob's trouble is we talked about that this morning and we talked about revelation six we just talked about that he opened the sixth seal but now what is the seventh seal like i said before the seventh seal is the same as the seventh trumpet so we receive our seventh seal saint our seventh seal body change here everybody okay with that six seals purges the earth sabbath brings christ on the scene right amen so now the earth's got to do the same thing the sixth seal purges the natural earth so that who can be who can because remember brother brown said god can't put his feet on the earth till the millennium right his literal feet can't stand on the earth until the millennium because there's sin here now we're going to look and see too that there's sin here he's inside working his way out like i said before you got to let that kingdom become part of this kingdom and you're going to manifest who you are folks we're going to manifest who we are whether we want to or not we can suppress it for years but one day it's going to all come out it's got to because the kingdom is going to have to come into power one way or the other like we were talking about this morning that beast's power he's going to have a kingdom but he's wanting a natural kingdom he's going to set up a natural kingdom ten kings and he wants to go to the world see all the fineries and and we read it last wednesday he wants everything he wants the gold he wants the money he wants the silver he wants to land why do you think these rich people are buying land now they want to possess something they think possessing something is going to keep them here they can have all they want and keep them here because it's going to burn just like all that other stuff's going to burn but see god burned me out one day god burned you out one day oh and did it feel good because i i i was looking at a quote back here i didn't bring it where brother ryan said the most cleansing thing is fire if you want to sterilize something put some fire on it burn it so brother what do we get the holy ghost and fire and that fire is going to burn out all these things and then you still get more fire to burn out all these things in that second realm so that that middle guy can have what have his way with you amen i hope that's good for the young people too because i want you to understand we we talk about things and we talk about what we're going to do and we talk about these worlds but remember it's an it's a type of what you're going through as a born-again believer because you're going to go through it first before the world goes through it so all these things we're going to talk about the battle of armageddon oh that's a horrible thing well it's a battle that me and you have all the time right in our mind the greatest battle ever fault bob read it this morning greatest battle ever fought is the battle of armageddon in your brain but remember it will come to an end i just read you that old things will pass away behold all things will become new amen right so the kingdom of this world so the seventh seal that we get here the earth is going to literally get one in the millennium because i'm gonna read it to you in a minute there was a promise to king david that he would sit on a throne and rule the 12 tribes of israel in a house or in a temple and that's what's going to happen in the millennium because remember see it's not to us we've already been changed we've already had all that done but they're go there's going to have some people in the millennium that's going to have to come through i will read it here in a minute but there's going to be a heathen and different things but i want to try to get to that today so let's skip over all this down to oh let's see let's go down to quote number two um on our regular notes and thank you for doing that brother anderson whoever else is back there right after revelations 11 7 that's kind of where we were at this morning the two prophets are killed and then we come to the 70 weeks of daniel now watch now let me stop right here just a minute that you might know beyond one shadow of a doubt that i just wouldn't take that one place i can take it through the entire scripture and prove to you that seven days that seven one week is seven years remember we did it in the bibles in genesis i just did it over here in revelation the 13th chapter 11 chapter and third verse look then prophets will prophesy 1200 three score days which is in the midst of the last week after the three and a half years then they're cut off and armageddon sets in so now we're in armageddon so let's continue on with that let's go to the next one number three now here's what we were talking about last week now when he gets the money who's the he this is the beast the antichrist all right when he gets the money now look to be able to get the money he's got to have a system in place he's got to have a kingdom in place he's got to have a his own revelation in place and see you're being deceived by it now if you're not born again you don't have to wait till till the middle of the 70th week of daniel if you're not born again you're deceived under it now because remember he deceives the whole world with this except the people that are sealed by the baptism of the holy ghost now when he gets the money all under control then he breaks this covenant with the jews as daniel here said he would do in the midst of the last half of the 70 weeks of daniel and then brother what will he do he will have all of the world trade and commerce and packed with the world now listen at this point in time the world can't get together on nothing right something's gotta happen supernaturally because naturally it'll never happen you can't even get something to come to the league of nations you can't get someone to come to the pack of eight the pack of ten the pack of four and whatever they got going on some of them ain't coming why because they've got so many differences somewhere this is all all these differences are going to have to head under one person and what will it head under religion a pact with the world because he'll hold the wealth of the world completely and during that time then two prophets will rise on the scene and call 144 thousand you you think he's you think brother brown's off but listen that thing's being set up now we were talking downstairs listen ronald reagan was a good president let me put that he was a good president he was good for the economy he was good for america but i'm telling you it's like brother paul said his name was ronald wilson reagan six six six he was a good president but when he got with that pope and destroyed russia he set up the one world government under the pope that was back in the 80s folks for those of you are going who's ronald reagan he was a president in the united states back before some of y'all were even born okay but you'll read about if you'll stay awake in school but he was he was a great economist though the world the united states grew exponentially during his time we had a real good economic he was a good economic president but what he done he got with the pope and they destroyed russia and that took the it took the bear and broke the bear up russia ussr broke it up under who did it him and the pope the beast and the lamb they came up out of the sea with the two horns they did it in the 80s so this thing is not going to have to wait till the you know every how many years it is from now it's being set up now it's just going to keep snowballing when we leave because he's going to take over the wealth of the whole world so during this time two prophets will rise on the scene call 144 000 then what will take place then the mark of the beast revelation 13 will set in because he holds all the commerce trading everything of the world and what will take place then the mark of the beast will come in that no man can buy or sell now listen that is not the mark of the beast that you can't buy or sell go back again folks the mark of the beast is unbelief the mark of the beast is not born being born again the mark of the beast is not buying and selling food but it is under that system of the mark of the beast everybody got that okay thank god the church will be enjoying a great three and a half years in glory don't go through that so that's what we don't have to go through that all right so now we don't have to look at the chart just keep going revelations 19 verse 6 no me and you are going to leave so i heard it was the voice of great multitude the voice of many waters the voice of mighty thundering saying hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent reigneth this is not israel this is the bride let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the what marriage of the lamb now remember israel can't marry god that's right they're devo he's divorced him she can't marry her again okay but he marries us and his wife has made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed and find linen clean and white for the fine linen and his righteousness of the saints in other words we took a body change and we've gone all right blessed are they which called to the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto them these are the true sayings of god so we take a rapture so we're going to go through this real quick go again now when we go into rapture then tribulation starts on the world we were just talking about that the sixth seal so i saw three unclean spirits like frog i didn't want to get into this while some of them were here this morning so because we know we know what those unclean spirits were it was a trinitarian doctrine but listen it's all doctrine it's false with god it's not just but it is strange that it's three three unclean unclean spirits not clean spirits unclean spirits like frogs but what now look it's the doctrine that comes out of the mouth of the dragon out of the mouth of the beast in the mouth of the false prophet listen they all three are one because they've got the same attitude they've got the same doctrine okay so the three unclean spirits like frogs brother brown said was the trinitarian doctrine the father son holy ghost uh split up of god in three and also the father son holy ghost baptism because they're all false if they're false they're of the devil they're unclean for they are the spirits of devils working miracles which go forth unto the kings of the earth listen what y'all going to do what y'all going to do one day when a guy comes up and says you got to go to a certain place in the united states and sit under a tape ministry and we know that's false but what if they start having miracles one right after the other what if you go to these people that are thinking about this yesterday what if you go to these people that have left the message and then god still got these churches and you hear these churches are having revival they're having the sick healed the dead raised one right after the other what are you going to do well it must be right brother wade no what's verse 14 say for they are the spirits of devils working miracles which go forth unto the kings of the earth and the whole world to gather them together in a great battle of hey we're in a battle like i said now right but what are you going to do when you pick somebody picks up the phone and says hey brother so and so they left the message man they're having they're having a revival they've got people sick healed they got the dead raised they got all these mighty miracles well what are they saying about brother brown oh he was false well what are you going to do i'm asking you because you're going to be deceived if you're not sealed now jesus says behold i come as a thief blesses he that watches keepeth his garment lest he walk naked and they see a shame and he gathered them into a place called in the hebrew tongue armageddon and the seventh angel poured out his vile this is the last of the vials into the air and there came a great voice out of the temple of god from the throne saying it is done there were voices and thundering enlightening great earthquakes such as nonsense men upon the earth so tribulation so mighty an earthquake and so great and the great city was divided into three parts and the cities of the nations fell this is a worldwide event and babylon came in remembrance before god had given to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath and every island fled away and the mountains were not found don't get scared folks we're not here don't get scared children don't get scared we're not going to be here if you're born again you're not going to be here and there fell upon men a great hell out of heaven every stone about the weight of a talent about 90 pounds in other words have you ever seen what a hail storm will do in the hail storm the hail is only about maybe the size of a golf ball or even maybe a tennis ball think about it they were weighing 90 pounds they'll just they'll crush a building and men blasphemed god because of the plague of the hail for the plague thereof was exceeding great let's go to the next one victor victory day brother brown says it'll finally wind up into the great battle of armageddon that'll be the last of it when she comes to the battle of armageddon that'll settle the whole thing just before the great millennium the armageddon is to clean off the earth see that's what i was when brother claude was preaching the other day you see that sixth seal that sixth seal is opened by those two prophets while they're here and judgment strikes the world through those two prophets but it continues on in through into the battle of armageddon and until everything's destroyed so that six seals not just a boom it's not just an event that just happened because listen your cleaning off is not a one day event that just happens if you're under the sixth seal sanctification of your nature it takes time just like under this battle of armageddon it's going to take time it's not a one-day battle just before the great millennium armageddon is to clean off the earth she re-purifies herself with this atomic blowing so man is going to do it it's going to be an atomic explosion it's going to be men pushing buttons and it's going to be just a nuclear holocaust but it's going to be worldwide not just in one place she re-purifies herself with this atomic blowing and the volcanic ash and things sink this soak the blood of men and upon the earth in sin and crime she sinks beneath the earth the volcanic braze out again and renews and cleans the earth for the great millennium he cleans his church during that time for a people to live here amen i like that see there's coming a time when it'll be great all right let's continue on now what did we say after the battle of armageddon was over what's going to happen there's going to be a millennial temple built it by the jews all right so we know the 144 thousand they die the two prophets die they go on a rapture the battle of armageddon happens here on earth and then they've got to come back sometime and build this temple or who's going to build it we don't know and it's not our business none of our business all right because but but listen to fulfill let's stop just a minute real quick daniel 70 weeks remember what is that 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and what else the city now for 69 weeks back before christ they've they've destroyed jerusalem titus after christ was crucified in 1870 titus totally destroyed jerusalem and it's never been built back since never been built back now sure they've got the buildings there i'm talking about the temple the temple's never been restored all right so the temple is going to be restored in the millennium because it will and i mean before the millennium because it's got to take that daniel 70 weeks that last week pay attention three and a half years the prophets prophesy and they're cut off there's three and a half more years left to put this temple in because it's to thy people and what the city so it's got to restore the people now who how's the people going to be restored through to prophets restore the people um end of sin reconciliation for iniquity they're going to be born again believers all right amen but now what about the city it's laying in complete destruction because armageddon is going to clean her off even if they tried to build it back and brother brown said that the mosque of omar they'll put a bomb right down in the middle of it so it's going to blow it completely to smithereens so where's the city they got to build one ezekiel 40 in the 5th and 20th year of our captivity in the beginning of the year and the 10th day of the month and the 14th year after that the city was smitten in other words it was destroyed and the self same day the hand of the lord was upon me and brought me thither and the visions of god now what is a vision it's a vision of something that's going to happen brought me into the land of israel set me up on a very high mountain by which was the frame of a city on the south and he brought me through there and behold there was a man whose appearance was like the appearance of brass with a line of flax in his hand and a measuring reed and he stood at the gate and the man said unto me son of man behold with thine eyes and hear with thine ears and set down hard upon all that i shall show thee for to the intent that i might show them unto thee art thou brought hither declare all that thou see us to the house of israel now from ezekiel 40 through ezekiel 44 it gives you all the dimensions tells you how many how many where the temple is going to be and how much the dimensions are and i'm not going to get into that because they're going to build it see there's the restoration of the people has already been done now comes the restoration of the city in the last half of the 70 weeks of daniel everybody got that say amen all right we've been taught this many many for many many years all right so now let's go to the next number five six full purpose now look when the tabernacle is erected the resurrection has come the jews has returned christ and his bride has come the jew the 144 000 are sealed the millenniums in other words taking place there will be an anointing when the most holy place will be anointed now what are they doing they're building the temple outer court inner court holy of holies everybody got that because that's the rest restoration of the city now remember it's not the new city that's ours it's the tabernacle that god promised david he would sit on a throne and rule the 12 tribes of israel so there's got to be a city belt for them to do that in all right i'll read some more quotes it'll clarify it here in just a minute for there will be an anointing when the most holy place will be anointed the holy holy of holies and the most holy the most holy place is a sanctuary where god lived between the cherubims now remember there was an outer court right there was an inner court and there was a holy of holies now where was god he wasn't in the outer court he wasn't in the inner court so much as they had the little things they had to do where was god he came down in the inner court and only one priest went in there and did his job and then came back out everybody got there so that's the holiest of holies now remember same thing with me and you outer court inner court memories and conscious imagination holy of holies is where god is me and you that's where god is with us he's inside that holy of holies now what's going to happen here though and and i you know when we studied daniel 70 weeks i thought man where did brother burnham but it's really simple you would think now see here we got to go back just a minute you will think you would think that we have nothing to do with it being gentiles which we don't in building the temple right but where is the holiest of holy people at amen it's us it's us that's why brother brown got the revelation that when when the temple was to be anointed it would not be anointed by a cloud because remember back in solomon's time solomon they dedicated the tabernacle what happened god came down in the cloud and filled the whole place all right the jews sure they're holy but they had a they had a uh their distinction was to build the city and they're not second-rate citizens don't get me wrong but they turned god down so he couldn't make them bride so they can't be the holiest of holies the holiest of holies is me and you there's no holier people on the face of the earth are in heaven besides jesus christ and his bride and i thought we were one yes all right so what comes to that sanctuary is they're going to build this temple and the and 144 000 are going to build this temple and they're going to build it exactly the way ezekiel said and then we come riding back in the millennium we're going to be able to go into that holy of holies because that's who they're that's what they're waiting on they're waiting on the temple to be i don't say re-anointed but to be anointed and it can't be anointed by nobody but christ in the bride the most holy place is a sanctuary where god lived between the cherubims and this time this time christ will set in the most holy place with the anointing upon him what is anointing that's upon him me and you they'll need no sun there for the lamb is the midst of the city shall be the light the sun will never go down in that city as old uncle jim used to say and it never will because christ will be that light the anointed one and the king will come and take his throne for one thousand years to reign let's go to the next now revelations 19. now we read revelations 19 the first world we went up the marriage of the lamb has come we've been at the marriage supper now what's happening at the end of all this to three and a half years of preaching the battle of armageddon they have built the temple and then you and i come riding back into the temple to start the millenniums everybody got that and i saw a new i saw heaven open behold a white horse and he that sat on him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he does judge and make war you got to read this right because remember we're the judge in the future home right before you go into the future home there's a white throne judgment so this is clearly telling you that it's going into the millennium not into the future home because he's going to be a he's death judge and mate war his eyes were as a flame of fire and his head were many crowns he had a name written that no one knew but he himself and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his name is called the word of god and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean that's us and out of his mouth goes a sharp sword that with it he should smite the nations now watch and he shall rule them with a rod of iron now i didn't bring it but in the old testament that's exactly what he's going to do in the millennium he's going to rule the 12 tribes of israel not with a rod of iron but he's going to be their king not with a literal rod you understand what i'm saying you got to look at the allegories and he traded the wine press of the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of almighty god and he hath on his veteran on his thigh name written king of kings and lord of lords let's go to number six and see what brother brown has to say about that what is it his people had just crowned him king of kings and lord of lords coming back to his holy temple anointed with the presence of god to live and reign through the millennium with his church amen the appearing with the mighty king to take her place her place who's to her me and you he has no other wife when you hear the word her attacked onto god that's me and you because you don't have two or three wives the appearing of the mighty king to take her place at his side the new royal anointed temple now the sixfold purpose of revelation 6 1 to revelation 19 is fulfilled what's the last purpose of the sixth full purpose to anoint the most holy so the scripture fits right in let's go to number seven back in the 70 weeks of daniel now notice that's where we seen her coming back to the millennial temple over here look at the end of the jewish age what is the end of the jewish age the last half of that 70th week to finish daniel 70 weeks all right at the end of the jewish age the anointed here he comes riding on a white horse those follow him on white horse horses powers dressed in white blood or vesture dipped in blood wrote on him the word of god he cometh the mighty conqueror to set up the millennium coming to the temple glory there he meets that hundred and forty four thousand because see he's coming to the he's coming into the millennium not to meet me and you we've been with him the whole time but he comes to meet that 144 000 that's been sent down here to build that temple on the earth to finish the 70 weeks of daniel so let's continue on now look this is the order and then we'll start in the millennium and we'll just for a few minutes ah the church age ending is blacked out the bride is called and we've already entered into tribulation this is a question someone asked him he said no no no i wish that i could not i could just have more time on that scene the bride when she's taken from the church then the church age will cease laodicea goes into chaos the bride goes to glory tribulation period sets in upon the sleeping virgins that's what we've just been talking about for three and a half years while israel is getting its prophecy the two witnesses then tribulation sets in upon israel and then comes the battle of armageddon which destroys all things look and then the bride returns back with the groom for a thousand years the millennium reign after that comes to white throne judgment after that comes a new heaven and the earth the new city coming down from god out of heaven eternity and time blends together now remember what we're fixing to talk to talk about in the millennium we're still in time it's not now brother i'm seeing eternity and time blends together that's when the new city comes down this city that they build over there in israel is not our new city that's still reserved in the mind of god waiting on revelations over there when he sees the new city coming down out of heaven so now listen why do we have to have this millennium all right there's millennialists i've read about several ones brother branham quotes about a few of them so let's read though where do we get a millennium everybody wake up just for a minute everybody wake up just for a minute okay everybody wait now blow that chauffeur what do you do it's not even don't come anymore without it yes sir now i want you to blow and blow it backwards you know blow it back that way think of peter 3 8. now look we talk about a millennium this is why we're going to have a millennium does everybody know why we're going to have one all right some do not take it peter 3 8 says beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day all right that's bible got it so now let's turn to genesis 2 verse 17. god is telling adam right that remember the conditional covenant was talking about this morning it was a conditional covenant do eat this don't eat that but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day now what did peter say a thousand years is a day a day is a thousand years for in the day not today listen if if eve would have fell dead when she did what she did he would demand one day 24 hour day right but she did not she lived whatever 900 years like like adam did so we know that god can't lie so we know that that's what he was meaning for in the thousand years or in the day that you eat thereof thou shalt surely die methuselah live how long 969 years we everybody knows that why because nobody's ever lived a thousand years the curse in the garden made sure no one lived over a thousand years so what is a millennium going to do it's going to bring it right back up and make that true because they have taken then of the tree of life and they're going to live a thousand years to prove that the sin curse is over with somebody has got to live a thousand years now it's not me and you we're eternal we don't have a day or a night so somebody's got to be in that millennium to live a thousand years now this is where it might get a little bit sticky but listen look brother brown they asked him one time and i think i got it for later they said brother brown will children be born in the millennium he says looks like they could looks like they couldn't then he talks about a heathen being raised up in the millennium to be preached to so there's some things in that i don't understand but listen remember let's just get the gist of where we're at and what we're doing and then we'll let the lord reveal it to us because if he reveals it to us we ain't got to worry about we don't speculate and we don't assume because you know what that does when you assume okay isaiah 65 17. i learned that a long time ago now here's isaiah behold i create new heavens and a new earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind but be glad and rejoice forever in that which i create for behold i create jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a joy it's not a very joyful place over there now i'll promise you that and i will rejoice in jerusalem and join my people and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her no the voice of crying there shall be no more thence and then thence an infant of days nor an old man that hath not filled his day see this is the part i don't understand maybe the lord will reveal it to you and you can help me with it for the child shall die a hundred years old but now listen there's nowhere brother brown said that people couldn't die in the millennium nowhere and there's nowhere in the bible except right here so let's don't get all messed up with it because listen remember it's not to me and you you and i are to sit and rule and reign over that group of people ever what that group of people is all right but the center being a hundred years old shall be a curse see that's i'm having an issue with that i'm just going to be honest with you i don't know everything brother call him out but i don't know nothing and i don't know nothing either there and look and they shall build houses here's the key they shall build houses and inhabit them so we know this is not the future home because remember the future home you don't build that house you're building you're building it right now this is your part of the future home right here by your new birth will give you a place to live in the future home so we don't have to build anything you say brother brother they're gonna build i think it says they will and listen they don't built a temple before this you say built it with what here's my here's my take on this whole thing and this is just me and i may be wrong as rain but remember it's an atomic war so it's not going to be that this place is going when we walk back down here the bible tells us that we'll walk out on the ashes of the wicked so we're not going to walk out in this clean like the new city is going to be everybody understand that because remember there's not sin in the millennium but there's still sin there underneath everybody got that all right so we got to get this out of the way but my take on it is if if the if the atomic doesn't blow everything up let's put it that way there's still stuff here there's going to be probably still trees that make it and there's still going to be other things that make it because they got builded by something rocks sticks i'm just telling you what the bible says they shall not build in another inhabit but it says and they shall build houses and inhabit them and it's not just one house because it says houses and look they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them where are they going to get the seed from if there's not something left over they shall not build in another inhabit in other words your daddy bills you know your grandpa builds a house and then he passes away and gives that house to you and and then daddy passes away and he gives that house to you that's not what that that says you'll build it and not another will inhabit it for this whole thousand years they shall not plant and another eat for as the days of a tree are the days of my people and mine elect shall long enjoy the works of their hands you and i are not going to be doing that with the bride they shall not labor in vain nor bring forth for trouble for they are the seed of the blessed of the lord and their offsprings with them now you can claim that one of them and it shall come to pass that before they call i will answer and while they are yet speaking i will hear the wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the lion shall eat straw like the bullet that's going to be kind of funny to see a lion walk up with them great big old teeth sticking down like this like this right here and they start pulling grass up out of the ground yeah but that's the way it was supposed to be in right that's the way it was before the fall eat straw like the bullock and dust shall be the serpent's meat i guess we're gonna have snakes there too they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain saith the lord all right let's go to the next one isaiah 66 now to me this is the millennium the new heavens it always stays singular with earth you have heavens but you always got one earth it's not going to be earth's for there's the new heavens and the new earth which i will make and shall remain before me saith the lord so shall your seed and your name remain and it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another you've got to count time you've got to count time amen amen you've got to count time in the millennium from one new moon to another and from one sabbath to another that's a day shall all flesh come to worship before me saith the lord somewhere in the old testament and i'll try to find it that you're they're still going to because what is it it's jewish they're going to have feast days the three great feast days i can't remember one's pentecost and the other one's first fruits and the other and something else everybody would always come to the temple every year three times a year or every year they come to those three feasts and it's gonna continue on why because this is a jewish domain that we're talking about not a not a gentile domain because it's only going to be the bride and 144 000 and whoever else comes up in all this that we're talking about and they shall go forth and look upon look and they shall go forth and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me you might see some dead people i'm just reading bible i just want you to see that and they shall go forth and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me for their worm shall not die neither shall their fire be quenched and they shall be abhorring to all flesh let's go to jeremiah 33 to me this covers every bit of it thus saith the lord again there shall be heard in this place now what is jeremiah let's go back to what is jeremiah jeremiah is that's the time of captivity that's the time that they're going to be dispersed during the time of jeremiah god says you're going to leave this place i'm going to make you leave because i'm going to make this place desolate because you can't live by my order i'm going to get rid of you not get rid of you wipe you off but i'm going to send you and disperse you into other nations thus saith the lord again there shall be heard in this place which you say shall be desolate without man and without beast even in the cities of judea and in the streets of jerusalem they are that are desolate without a man without inhabitant and without beast the voice of joy and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride the voice of them that shall say praise the lord of hosts for the lord is good for his mercy endure forever and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise look into the house of the lord for i will re i will cause to return the captivity of the land as it was at first thus saith the lord of hosts again in this place which was desolate without man and without beast and all the cities therein shall be inhabitation of shepherds causing their flock to lie down in the cities of the mountains in the cities of the veil and the cities of the south and the land of benjamin the place about jerusalem and in the cities of judea shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth them saith the lord behold the days come saith the lord that i will perform that good thing which i have promised until the house of israel not to us and the house of judah in those days and at that time will i cause the branch of righteousness to grow up unto david and look and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in that land so that whoever's going to rule and reign is going to rule and reign and execute judgment and righteousness so who is it king david which is not david himself it will be the lord jesus christ the son of david in those days shall judah be saved and jerusalem shall dwell safely and this is the name wherewith she shall be called the lord our righteousness for thus saith the lord david shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of israel god promised david he was going to sit on the throne and rule the 12 tribes of israel just like he did when he was here alive all right let's go to the next one so now we'll go to revelations 20. and i saw an angel come down from heaven having the keys to the bottomless pit we'll stop right here having the keys of the bottom of this pit and a great chain in his hand and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which was the devil in satan and bound him a thousand years so in other words sometime before the millennium satan is going to be put in a place where he can't get a hold of me and you or anybody else amen and cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and put a seal on him that he should deceive the nations no more so look there's going to be nations we're going to live a thousand years so there's going to be nations brought up they're going to be vineyards that are planted houses that are going to be built till the thousand years should be finished after that he must be loosed a little season and i saw thrones and they that sat on them and judgment was given unto them who is that me and you and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of jesus and for the word of god which had not worshipped the beast neither his image neither had received his mark on the forehead or in their hands and they lived and reigned with christ one thousand years that's the bride but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection the one we were talking about the one the bride comes up in the first resurrection because look it says blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priests of god in christ and shall reign with him 1 000 years so where's satan going to be during this time he's going to be bound by circumstance that he can't work because the bride is going to be on earth the 144 000 is going to be on earth and if there's going to be a heathen if there's going to be a fifth sealed jew whatever is going to come back into this dimension satan can't work in them for a thousand years [Music] and then after that thousand years he's going to have to be loosed and we'll talk about that let us read let's read this one more luke 1 31 and then we'll close musicians get ready to come we've just been going an hour and y'all slept for 30 minutes so and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth the son and shall call his name jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end he promised david let's read one more let's read jeremiah 23 and then we'll stop i want to try to stay in the bible so you take and listen to what the bible has to say about this behold the days come saith the lord that i will raise them to david a righteous branch now i read this and i'll read it again and a king shall reign and prosper look and shall reign and prosper and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth i mean literally what's going to happen is is is we're going to be in this city with lord jesus christ the bride doing whatever we want to do but there's there's there's nations out there the 144 000 the jews and they're still doing that now they won't be doing any sacrifices you understand that but they're still going to be doing the things that they did because listen jew knows what to do with all these feast days and all the different things what to bring and what not to bring all right and then what they're going to come and they and god's going to execute judgment is there going to be a a squabble i mean you know there's not going to be traffic court there i don't think you know or anything like that definitely not going to be a divorce court so but there will be certain things because he can't judge and and and be a just judge and not have something to judge right like it's like brother brown said he said we shall rule and reign on the earth well now to rule and rain you've got to have something to rule and reign over right so there's got to be subjects there to rule and reign over in his day judah shall be saved and israel shall dwell safely this is the name his name whereby he shall be called the lord our righteousness therefore come the days come say the lord that they shall no more say the lord liveth which brought us the children of israel the land of egypt but the lord liveth was brought up and which led the seed of the house of israel out of the north country look and from all countries whether i driven them now remember what did god do in jeremiah he dispersed the jews they tried to get back in certain times and he kept dispersing them putting them in russia putting them in germany putting them in the united states putting them in every country in the world but he promised he would drive them back to israel i'm going to take you from all these countries which i've driven you and they shall dwell in their own land remember what the prophet says that god will not dwell will not deal with a jew except he's in this homeland so they got to get back to the homeland now listen we saw that in 1946 and the different ones different times where brother brown said they started coming back but let me tell you something they came back to get preached to they came back that's the whole thing they didn't they think they came back to see the messiah well they're going to see him all right but they're going to see him through two witnesses they're not going to see what they think they're going to see so they're going to see god through two witnesses and then you know the 144 thousand are going to know for surety god is finally going to listen to us because we're in our homeland we're trying to do everything we do god sent us to prophets he's given us everything we need so they're going to get saved same thing with me and you folks let's stand our feet musicians come that's the same way with me and you and our new birth and all the different things that we're looking at god has given us these provisions like i said before he's already given us our healer it's already inside of me and you our savior is already inside of me and you he saved us our keeper the one that's going to take us up the statute for me man he's already in us he's not far folks listen if you're getting what the bible tell what the bible tell us the bible says if you'll look toward in the old testament said if you'll look toward the tabernacle just look toward it and pray he said i'll hear you i mean look toward the tabernacle pray i'll hear you well now me and you don't have to look at a certain tabernacle right here right here look toward a certain tabernacle me and you we're walking tabernacles and man we don't have to look at one we know we don't have to focus our eyes on one place but the jews do that's why they have to have a homeland they have to have the city being built according to daniel 9 27. they have to be back in their homeland they have to have the temple belt they have to have a gathering of the 144 thousand to get that millennium started and then live a thousand years to prove that the sin curse is over and then we'll get to the rest pray for brother aaron
