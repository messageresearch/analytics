[43:02] with each other and to to you know look
[43:05] into that all right now what have we
[43:07] been talking
[43:09] about as we read in Ephesians there
[43:12] we've been talking about how that we we
[43:15] chosen in
[43:17] him all right and
[43:20] then we know for assurity of one thing
[43:24] that he is the word am all right now not
[43:28] to just say God is word see we we get to
[43:32] thoughts in our mind uh you know
[43:36] uh ideas I was awake this morning about
[43:39] 5: till 6:30 laying in bed and just you
[43:42] know just just thinking things
[43:45] over you know I like to do that I like
[43:48] to just think about what God is and in
[43:53] his doings and and ways and uh just
[43:56] watch it
[43:58] unfold in your
[44:00] mind if you'll just get away from your
[44:02] own thinking and get into God's thinking
[44:05] See it'll change the whole thing that's
[44:08] why I read the scripture there and we
[44:10] tried to speak a little bit as I said
[44:11] Wednesday night there on um God's
[44:15] thoughts you know and how real they are
[44:17] and and things like that but see we
[44:21] think that
[44:25] uh see we we say that here we are and
[44:29] we're real you know beating on the pit
[44:33] we think this is real right but we ought
[44:36] to
[44:37] realize that and and I got this in the
[44:40] next message or two that we will get
[44:42] into it and uh you know God is real amen
[44:47] and You Know that heaven is real am but
[44:49] see we we think about it as just being
[44:52] you know some something and and you know
[44:56] but we're the real now that's as carnal
[44:58] as anybody can be in our thinking I'm
[45:01] sorry that's just my way of expressing
[45:03] it see you mean we talk about a God that
[45:06] could create us but yet what was he
[45:09] before the world yeah was he just a
[45:12] glove floating around cuz there was
[45:14] nowhere to
[45:15] float there was no atmospheres there was
[45:18] no
[45:20] doings and we think he was
[45:23] just and then he had an idea and he said
[45:26] we'll do this no I'm going to get to it
[45:30] one of these days and prove to you the
[45:31] Lord's willing by the scripture that
[45:34] heaven is real amen yes sir that's
[45:36] exactly
[45:39] right and God is real that's the thing
[45:43] I'm trying to get you to
[45:44] see the main thing of all of it but
[45:47] we'll get to it on a letter message but
[45:49] you just think about it brother Dale
[45:51] believes in a real God
[45:53] Amen what do you think eternal life let
[45:55] me ask you this this question cuz this
[45:56] will be about three or four sermons down
[45:59] I know but what do you think eternal
[46:01] life
[46:04] is you think eternal life is like a a
[46:08] shock of
[46:11] electricity is that what you think it
[46:15] is I mean you think eternal life is a
[46:18] shock of electricity that standing there
[46:20] on the day of Pentecost and
[46:21] then just you
[46:24] know right m
[46:29] I thought eternal life was a person amen
[46:31] that's right right
[46:33] amen do you think it's just some kind of
[46:36] a shock you got some kind of a feeling
[46:38] you got or some kind of a thing come on
[46:41] brother amen no see that's what I said
[46:43] that'll be 10 messages I guess down the
[46:46] road but and see that's what I want you
[46:49] to think
[46:50] about that we were chosen in him before
[46:55] the world
[46:56] that's right all
[46:58] right and in doing that see we're trying
[47:03] to keep our studies now remember how
[47:05] we're doing we're trying to keep our
[47:06] study is is we haven't come to earth now
[47:09] I'll tell you when we we we change
[47:12] courses and come down to earth and it
[47:14] may take 10 or 15 more sermons to do it
[47:17] but you know then we'll talk about
[47:19] coming to Earth I'm trying to get you to
[47:22] realize that heaven is real right amen
[47:25] that eternal life is real right see it's
[47:29] not just our thoughts that's what I'm
[47:31] reading the scripture about see our
[47:33] thoughts are not his thoughts our ways
[47:35] are not his ways Lord amen all right and
[47:39] see in doing that then we'll keep
[47:41] ourself back our until we come down this
[47:45] way so what we've been dealing with we
[47:48] found out a good many things has Tak a
[47:50] place before there was even the
[47:52] foundation of the world or anything
[47:54] right you know and and we still hav't
[47:57] covered nothing of job and and you know
[48:00] there and where were you and we haven't
[48:03] even got into the uh loue Book of Life
[48:07] we haven't got into them we have still
[48:09] some more messages to go before we we
[48:12] leave heaven and come to Earth in our
[48:15] journey but see I'm trying to get you to
[48:17] think about the how real it is there
[48:19] amen and see you say but but brother
[48:21] Dale this is this was only in his mind
[48:26] you know see that's our thoughts cuz
[48:29] we've read enough of the prophet's
[48:30] message to be able to pick out the
[48:32] quotes and and say things you know and
[48:35] and that's right
[48:37] the his thoughts was the thoughts in his
[48:40] mind that's
[48:41] true but how real are his thoughts right
[48:47] amen and as I said are we thinking it's
[48:50] just some before the world is just some
[48:52] kind of a a a glob or some kind of a
[48:56] something of God and just nothing just
[49:00] nothing well remember this and it'll
[49:02] help you we live in a dimension called
[49:05] LifeLight and matter what we call a
[49:08] third dimension all right now fourth
[49:11] dimension is like demons travel in it
[49:14] and Spirits things like that taking
[49:15] place the prophet said and like TV is a
[49:18] fourth dimensional product and they're
[49:20] getting these ether ways or what they
[49:22] call them so filled with all these phone
[49:24] systems until they're having to break
[49:25] into these other things to be able to to
[49:28] bring everything forth and where now you
[49:30] can just touch a button and call Africa
[49:32] you know just like that see uh it's
[49:36] getting Beyond almost Beyond human
[49:38] thinking of the ability right but
[49:41] remember I said we live in life like and
[49:43] matter fourth dimension is more
[49:48] real than we
[49:50] are that's what I want you to break away
[49:52] from I want you to break away from your
[49:55] carnal ity I'm talking about me
[49:58] okay you all of us amen fourth dimension
[50:03] is greater than this
[50:05] Dimension okay The Fifth Dimension is a
[50:09] place that's prepared for the devil and
[50:11] his angels right and people that are
[50:14] going to be in hell right so that's more
[50:17] real than we are right all right sixth
[50:21] Dimension is all of the Christians that
[50:23] have died which would have to cover the
[50:25] old Testament people you know that will
[50:27] will come up and cover all of the Bride
[50:30] of Jesus Christ amen and brother random
[50:32] going there you know beyond the curtain
[50:34] of time he didn't just see glob floating
[50:37] around or thoughts well I thought I saw
[50:41] something he saw people amen he saw
[50:44] trees he saw
[50:47] things that's a whole lot more real than
[50:50] we
[50:51] are and look there was still more above
[50:54] because
[50:56] M he said where's Jesus i' like seen me
[50:58] he said he's in a higher Dimension
[51:00] y the seventh
[51:03] Dimension now we think that this is the
[51:05] real
[51:07] thing well okay if you think this is the
[51:10] real thing just remember when them toes
[51:13] turn up you're going somewhere
[51:16] right all right amen that's right am I
[51:20] right amen you know what I mean when you
[51:23] pass on you're going somewhere right
[51:25] right now wouldn't somewh you're going
[51:27] to be more real than what you are cuz
[51:30] there got to be made a place for you to
[51:33] abide
[51:35] see you know but we we're tied to hear
[51:38] right see and you know if I could just
[51:42] get into words what I see about it I
[51:46] believe it would change a lot of things
[51:48] right but anyhow we say but but brother
[51:51] Dale it's just the thoughts of
[51:54] God
[51:58] now what about the thoughts of
[52:03] God now remember what we were talking
[52:05] about there Wednesday night that God and
[52:08] we'll read something in here that God
[52:10] could never have another thought n
[52:13] that's right a different thought thank
[52:15] you Lord his thought is perfect amen
[52:19] amen and it can't be changed there's no
[52:22] no doings in it that would you know we
[52:25] know that right see then his thoughts
[52:27] are
[52:29] Eternal and a part of him yes amen right
[52:33] see and that's what I was trying to
[52:34] bring out Wednesday see your your your
[52:37] thoughts is part of you like Aon was
[52:39] coming in there ho to go life and we was
[52:41] about you know like this brother said
[52:43] one day he said the only time he knew he
[52:45] was take caring on an intelligent
[52:46] conversation when he was talking to
[52:49] himself you know you just you think
[52:53] about it you know we live a of our
[52:55] thoughts when I ever do a funeral or
[52:58] anything I always encourage people to
[53:00] remember the good right you know the
[53:03] good part of life and you know after a
[53:05] few weeks of grieving and things you
[53:09] know you'll
[53:10] start kind of grining about something
[53:13] then you'll remember something else and
[53:14] you kind of and you know you can start
[53:16] living off of good things that you
[53:18] remember that's just part of your
[53:19] thoughts well Sur if we could do that
[53:22] all right now our thoughts as I was
[53:24] trying to get across the D see that's
[53:25] what created all of this right yep the
[53:28] world you know God brought the world now
[53:30] you understand what I'm saying God
[53:32] brought the world but we take the things
[53:35] of the world we make a nice pull pit we
[53:38] we make a Pew for you to set in we make
[53:40] a car for you to drive you know when our
[53:43] plane to fly in and all of this that cuz
[53:46] that comes from our thoughts that's
[53:48] right
[53:49] correct and and and if that would be
[53:52] bring this to look like this I mean none
[53:55] of you we always say it none of you want
[53:56] to go out to Donnie would but go out and
[54:00] get an OA model and drive home today and
[54:04] at
[54:07] 90° he would cuz he'd be tickle
[54:10] tile but no that's right we used to
[54:13] leave and go to my aunt and uncles and I
[54:15] remember when when for you to go from
[54:18] our home to Atlanta was a Day's Journey
[54:21] any of you remember
[54:24] that no see you're not old enough and if
[54:27] you old enough you you had better cars
[54:28] than we did we had to stop three or four
[54:32] times we was over in South Carolina one
[54:34] time one of the cars messed up and it'
[54:36] run on level ground but it wouldn't run
[54:38] wouldn't pull up a hill so the only way
[54:39] to get the two cars back home what we do
[54:41] we put the one run in the back and we
[54:43] get to a hill start going up we run the
[54:44] back up push him over the hill kept on
[54:47] going till we got home you know but see
[54:50] how would you like to go back to
[54:52] that see our thoughts is what we're
[54:55] working on is continually opening to
[54:58] bring into greater things all right and
[55:01] truly if that is just a human thinking
[55:05] right amen then what are the thoughts of
[55:08] God
[55:11] Amen when them being Eternal and he
[55:14] cannot think of anything different from
[55:17] what he thought
[55:19] right because that's that that would be
[55:22] contrary all right so now let's read
[55:24] about that and keep that in mind of what
[55:27] we're trying to
[55:28] say see cuz the thoughts of God are
[55:31] Eternal but now get get away from one
[55:35] thing with me if you would
[55:37] please see we think it's just God
[55:39] sitting the
[55:42] thought well have a
[55:44] thought no no see that's our ways right
[55:49] you know that's our doings and our ways
[55:52] and things of of of doing and
[55:57] but think about God sitting there in
[56:03] heaven
[56:04] and I think it's a beautiful
[56:07] place
[56:10] but sitting there and then he begin to
[56:14] think you know why he begin to think we
[56:16] gave it to you that Wednesday night cuz
[56:18] the prophet of God said he had
[56:19] attributes in him that's right it's on
[56:21] the back of your notes on the last one
[56:22] today had attributes in him he said what
[56:25] is an attrib is just a
[56:27] nature God had a nature in him to be a
[56:30] savior healer
[56:32] father right all that was within him so
[56:37] it wasn't just him sitting as we
[56:39] thinking by
[56:45] himself eternal life right is what we're
[56:48] talking about
[56:50] amen eternal
[56:53] life you say brother you believe that we
[56:55] was back there in that eternal life
[56:59] don't ever forget that I'll give you
[57:01] there's a couple of quotes in today's
[57:03] message he said not your being here no
[57:05] that's right I'm not talking about Body
[57:07] Spirit Soul or Samuel Dale right or
[57:09] anyone
[57:12] else amen all right I'm talking about
[57:16] eternal life
[57:19] amen and if we was not a part of that
[57:22] eternal life we never will be other than
[57:24] we could be given eternal life one day
[57:27] amen that would still be in God's
[57:29] thinking and knowing that if he created
[57:31] a world that there was going to be more
[57:33] people than just the Bride As we call
[57:35] her or The Offspring of God right right
[57:39] see then let's get the word
[57:41] Eternal and thoughts
[57:44] together to where they can we can see
[57:47] that we
[57:50] existed sure in his thoughts
[57:53] right
[57:55] all
[57:56] right now that's seemingly pretty easy
[57:59] to handle right yes I mean it's pretty
[58:02] easy to handle a point that we think
[58:03] about well it was his thoughts about us
[58:06] he thought about us and you know that
[58:08] that carries on and that's been good
[58:10] enough until we have come down to the
[58:13] time now to understand
[58:16] amen and get into view all the things
[58:19] the prophet has got and bring it over
[58:21] that's why it just takes so long I think
[58:23] it's 30 30 31 quotes on here just a
[58:26] little bit and I could preach an hour
[58:28] off of each
[58:30] quote but to see the thoughts of
[58:34] God the prophet of God said it's not
[58:37] like a man with a blueprint no that's
[58:41] right now he gets it down and I gave you
[58:42] a quote which will show you one and the
[58:44] other I like to do that it's not like a
[58:47] somebody taking their mind and and
[58:49] figure out what you're going to be on
[58:52] no now that's what we do right right and
[58:56] I got a quote in here for brother around
[58:57] covers it the man gets the thought he
[58:59] does this and that and the other and
[59:00] just remember that the writing of the
[59:06] Bible come on the writing of the
[59:10] Bible was a prophet that was specially
[59:13] designed right you know now follow me
[59:18] through to where he could pick up that
[59:21] thought right amen right like of all
[59:24] said where did Abraham get that thought
[59:27] well know Lord I'll give you
[59:29] 10% the Lord said hey that's a pretty
[59:31] good thought I'll write it
[59:34] down now that's not exactly the way God
[59:37] does see Abraham picked that thought
[59:41] up that was part of God's word before
[59:44] the world
[59:46] right see and and the thoughts of God
[59:49] see those prophets would pick up those
[59:51] thoughts and transmit it down to you and
[59:53] I then we we're so blessed in the last
[59:56] day see that God sent a prophet right
[59:59] Amen to us which would not only be and
[1:00:03] somebody remind me to get back to this
[1:00:04] in a second would not only be a a uh a
[1:00:08] prophet but this would be a born again
[1:00:10] believer see no wonder brother r that
[1:00:13] said you know said you're greater of all
[1:00:15] why because he was not only a a prophet
[1:00:19] chosen a prophet right first thing he
[1:00:21] remembered was a vision right and thing
[1:00:25] but yet not only that he was a born
[1:00:27] again
[1:00:28] believer now you say but now brother
[1:00:30] Dale said uh those
[1:00:34] prophets see they received the thought
[1:00:36] of God and they spoke that thought all
[1:00:39] right we agree follow me but you mean to
[1:00:43] tell me that a Old Testament Prophet
[1:00:46] receiving a thought of
[1:00:49] God would be greater than a new
[1:00:52] testament Christian Christian born again
[1:00:56] believer as to pick up the thought of
[1:00:59] God you mean God would think more of the
[1:01:03] prophets of the Old Testament than he
[1:01:05] thinks of you and I his children there's
[1:01:08] something wrong with our carnality there
[1:01:10] that's right and then you take a
[1:01:13] five-fold
[1:01:14] Ministry and you bring her in the New
[1:01:17] Testament right and that's why she picks
[1:01:19] up the thoughts of God to bring to the
[1:01:20] people amen but yet still God speaks to
[1:01:24] you right amen that's that's righty come
[1:01:28] on that's the thing that I've always
[1:01:30] tried to get you to see it's not all
[1:01:33] that's in the preacher that's right
[1:01:35] that's right I'm want you to see God
[1:01:37] wants to talk to you right that's right
[1:01:40] sit down sometime and just think it over
[1:01:43] well I might get confused if you got the
[1:01:44] Holy Ghost how are you going to get
[1:01:46] confused
[1:01:49] right come on lack of information may
[1:01:51] cause you a problem right exactly
[1:01:55] y but how are you going to get confused
[1:01:56] if you got the eternal life amen that's
[1:01:59] right that's right see why can't you sit
[1:02:02] down sometimes and just think about the
[1:02:03] great things of how world and life is
[1:02:06] and how that heaven is more real than
[1:02:08] what we are amen
[1:02:10] amen
[1:02:13] see because that's the thoughts of God
[1:02:15] that's right that's the point I'm want
[1:02:17] you to get that God can transmit his
[1:02:19] thoughts into you now if you have
[1:02:22] eternal life now he he would transmit
[1:02:25] thoughts into man's mind that didn't
[1:02:28] have eternal life right you agree the
[1:02:31] Old Testament Prophet said didn't have
[1:02:33] eternal life right all right now if he
[1:02:36] could do that why can't he transmit into
[1:02:38] Born Again
[1:02:41] Believers his
[1:02:43] thoughts
[1:02:45] right and you realize who you are and
[1:02:47] what you do that's
[1:02:50] right all right so let's read
[1:02:53] now
[1:02:58] okay this will be taken from 149 of the
[1:03:01] church a book really s Church
[1:03:03] age watch carefully now and see
[1:03:07] this before there was ever a speck of
[1:03:11] Stardust now go on back
[1:03:13] totally before God was
[1:03:17] God God is an object to worship no one
[1:03:20] was there to worship him so he was at
[1:03:22] that time only potentially God
[1:03:25] and he was known only as eternal spirit
[1:03:28] y listen the bride was already in his
[1:03:32] mind
[1:03:34] amen see Earth her we just in his
[1:03:39] mind he was just thinking about us
[1:03:42] coming down
[1:03:45] here now I want you to get that away
[1:03:47] from me I'd like for you to get away
[1:03:49] from you one thing that God set up there
[1:03:52] and thought things over of what we're
[1:03:53] going to be down down here you'll never
[1:03:56] get the story of eternal
[1:03:59] life you'll never get what we're talking
[1:04:02] about the Eternal thoughts of God if you
[1:04:06] just dwell on what he thought of what
[1:04:08] we're going to be here that's right
[1:04:11] y that would not be that's not even
[1:04:14] sensible all right so let's
[1:04:16] go so bride was already in his mind yes
[1:04:20] she was she was existing in his thoughts
[1:04:24] and what about those thoughts of God
[1:04:27] they are Eternal are they not right
[1:04:32] okay the Eternal thoughts of God let me
[1:04:34] ask you are the thoughts of God Eternal
[1:04:37] if you can say this see this you will
[1:04:40] see many things amen God is unchangeable
[1:04:43] in both Essence and behavior amen we
[1:04:46] have studied that and proven that
[1:04:48] already God is infinite in his abilities
[1:04:51] so therefore he as God must be
[1:04:53] omniscient
[1:04:56] knowing all things right and if he's
[1:04:58] omniscient then he is not now learning
[1:05:02] nor is he taking counsel even with
[1:05:05] himself right nor is he at any time
[1:05:09] adding to his knowledge that's right if
[1:05:11] he can add to his knowledge then he's
[1:05:13] not omniscient the best we could say is
[1:05:16] that sometime he will be but that's not
[1:05:19] scriptural right he's omnicient he never
[1:05:22] had a new thought about anything because
[1:05:24] all his thoughts he has always had and
[1:05:28] always will have and knows the end from
[1:05:31] the beginning because he is God thus the
[1:05:34] thoughts of God are Eternal they are
[1:05:37] real they are not simply like a man with
[1:05:40] a blueprint he has drawn up and which
[1:05:42] one day will be transmitted into
[1:05:44] substance and form that's not it that's
[1:05:46] the way we do things right yep but they
[1:05:49] are already real and eternal and part of
[1:05:53] God that's right right amen already real
[1:05:56] and
[1:05:57] eternal and part of God right
[1:06:00] amen now remember what we're talking
[1:06:03] about I keep putting this on because I
[1:06:05] don't want somebody out there to get the
[1:06:07] wrong
[1:06:09] idea there a lot of people in this
[1:06:10] message believe you come into the world
[1:06:12] with eternal
[1:06:14] life you don't need to receive eternal
[1:06:16] life he always was eternal well I don't
[1:06:18] agree with that amen pure flat blunt as
[1:06:21] much as I can say it what can I say to
[1:06:22] make it harder right I don't agree with
[1:06:25] that
[1:06:26] amen I believe you have to receive
[1:06:29] eternal life amen amen but once you
[1:06:32] receive eternal life yep it's the same
[1:06:36] person of eternal life right it's not a
[1:06:38] zap of electricity that you just ready
[1:06:41] to feel something you think I got the
[1:06:43] Holy
[1:06:44] Ghost see and they don't do that right I
[1:06:48] saw God when I was 11 years old and I
[1:06:50] know better than that so don't ever try
[1:06:53] to talk to me about about God not being
[1:06:55] real now there just no need of it see
[1:06:58] anybody on the Internet or anything just
[1:06:59] ain't no need to worry about it because
[1:07:01] brother Dale done gone too far I guess I
[1:07:03] believe he's real I believe the Holy
[1:07:06] Ghost is a real person I believe it is
[1:07:08] the prophet would call him the person of
[1:07:10] Jesus Christ Living in each individual
[1:07:13] now how can you explain that
[1:07:17] right 7 billion people in I mean 7
[1:07:21] billion people in the world today and
[1:07:23] God could give every person eternal
[1:07:26] life you
[1:07:28] agree and each one of them would have
[1:07:31] the person of Jesus Christ Living in
[1:07:33] them by the new birth and they'd still
[1:07:36] be no less God they'd be more God Amen
[1:07:41] that's right all right see then we need
[1:07:43] to get it lined up in our mind and our
[1:07:45] thoughts I just don't want somebody
[1:07:46] thinking well they believe that this no
[1:07:48] I don't agree with what those brothers
[1:07:50] are preaching that are come in the world
[1:07:51] with eternal life no no sir
[1:07:54] I believe we come into a world with a
[1:07:56] representation pre from predestination
[1:07:58] like a little woman that dwell had
[1:07:59] brother around said in the future home
[1:08:01] right right I believe in that y but I
[1:08:04] don't believe in coming in the world
[1:08:05] with eternal life you're going to make
[1:08:06] me an eternal Sinner and I don't agree
[1:08:08] with that amen there is no such thing as
[1:08:10] an eternal
[1:08:12] sinner amen that will not work all right
[1:08:15] going down now to some of these I skip
[1:08:18] because it's a little between some of
[1:08:19] it's not page 150 the church age book
[1:08:22] somewhere in church age
[1:08:24] now it says that he has chosen Us in him
[1:08:28] before the foundation of the
[1:08:30] world that means that we were right
[1:08:33] there with
[1:08:36] him in the mind and thoughts of God
[1:08:40] before the foundation of the world that
[1:08:42] gives an eternal quality to the elect
[1:08:45] you can't get away from it that's right
[1:08:46] you remember what I told you the other
[1:08:48] day because people had argued that where
[1:08:49] it says in the beginning was the word
[1:08:51] word was with God and the word was God
[1:08:54] the trinitarians use that word with as a
[1:08:58] a a statement that they got to be two
[1:09:00] people
[1:09:02] right well who was he
[1:09:05] with well he was with
[1:09:11] me come on you already to know what
[1:09:13] brother Dale can quote brother Brown's
[1:09:15] message when he has to cuz it's always
[1:09:17] Ling in that brain brother brandham
[1:09:20] talks about how that not only were we
[1:09:23] with him
[1:09:25] you know in the form of with he never
[1:09:29] existed without me and you right amen
[1:09:32] that's eternal life
[1:09:35] amen right well then that give me
[1:09:37] eternal life no because you got to
[1:09:38] receive it right cuz that's the plan now
[1:09:41] listen if you think you come into into
[1:09:44] the world with eternal life what's the
[1:09:46] purpose of Jesus Christ dying what
[1:09:48] what's the whole reason what's what's
[1:09:49] any Worth to the to the death of Jesus
[1:09:52] Christ no cuz he couldn't come to redeem
[1:09:54] us right redeem means to go back where
[1:09:57] you come
[1:10:00] from what would be the purpose of trying
[1:10:02] to talk about
[1:10:05] anything you would just have us coming
[1:10:07] along and hey always
[1:10:12] was no right this don't work with me now
[1:10:15] I'm sorry amen I'm wrong forgive me pray
[1:10:19] for me all right page
[1:10:22] 151 the Samaran Church
[1:10:26] 8 according to Romans 4:16 we find that
[1:10:29] God has given a sure promise to all of
[1:10:32] Abraham's
[1:10:34] seed and Paul puts himself and all
[1:10:37] believers under that designation because
[1:10:40] he says Abraham who is the father of us
[1:10:43] all then he goes on to not only narrow
[1:10:46] down his definition but rather to
[1:10:48] finalize it in the Galatians 3 he
[1:10:51] identified the seed singular with with
[1:10:54] Jesus and counted the seed children as
[1:10:58] children of promise and promis having as
[1:11:02] having to do with election are the
[1:11:04] choosing of God that is exactly what we
[1:11:07] have been saying these who are the Royal
[1:11:10] seed are the elect of God are the
[1:11:12] predestinated forn of God and we in the
[1:11:16] mind of God and His Thoughts in very
[1:11:19] plain language the true bride of Christ
[1:11:21] was in the mind of God ET eternally do
[1:11:25] not express until each came forth in the
[1:11:27] designated decreed season as each came
[1:11:30] forth it became
[1:11:33] expressed and took its place in the body
[1:11:36] thus this bride is the literal spoken
[1:11:39] word seed bride now I thought we believ
[1:11:42] it was not the person that come
[1:11:44] predestinated eternally what it 154
[1:11:46] Church a book but it was the seed or
[1:11:49] word that come predestinated Eternal not
[1:11:52] the person
[1:11:55] though she is feminine in designation
[1:11:57] she is also called the body of Christ is
[1:11:59] a very apparent that she ought to be
[1:12:01] called that for she was predestinated in
[1:12:04] him came from the same Source right
[1:12:09] right was eternal with him and is now
[1:12:11] manifesting God in a many membered body
[1:12:13] whereas once God was manifested in one
[1:12:15] member even the Lord Jesus Christ right
[1:12:19] now something being of the same
[1:12:21] Source see that's where the trinitarian
[1:12:24] concept came in because the trinitarian
[1:12:27] concept that n a council the argument
[1:12:30] was whether or not with Jesus was God or
[1:12:34] another source you know another God or
[1:12:37] whatever something in a source that was
[1:12:39] the argument at
[1:12:41] n see whether he was God or another God
[1:12:45] or another source so then they developed
[1:12:47] the point of God in three persons cuz
[1:12:50] they could read enough the Bible and it
[1:12:52] didn't develop out of it right real
[1:12:54] quick it took maybe 300 years more to 6
[1:12:58] or6 and then they began to develop and
[1:13:01] bringing in the uh three God Trinity
[1:13:04] Real Deals and all like that right if
[1:13:06] you'll study your your history part but
[1:13:11] see being there they they found out or
[1:13:15] thought they had it figured out because
[1:13:17] they said okay he's one source and he's
[1:13:19] another
[1:13:21] source now when you got two
[1:13:24] sources you got two different people
[1:13:28] right brother Dale you don't believe
[1:13:30] that Jesus was a separate identity from
[1:13:32] God no Ser I believe he was almighty God
[1:13:36] in human
[1:13:38] flesh I got enough sense to know the
[1:13:40] flesh was not Eternal but I got enough
[1:13:44] sense to know too that in his
[1:13:46] resurrection his flesh what's made
[1:13:49] Eternal so we have no arguments today
[1:13:52] over it right
[1:13:54] I was thinking there when it was over in
[1:13:55] the Psalms readings you notice it said
[1:13:57] he chose David and made him these things
[1:13:59] and you know that that was probably a
[1:14:01] thousand years I don't know how many
[1:14:03] years between where Isaiah was writing
[1:14:05] and where David
[1:14:06] existed and it was just like he said
[1:14:08] I've made him just now I just made him
[1:14:10] there right see when God's talking he's
[1:14:13] not like our peanut brain that's right
[1:14:17] but when you say something is the same
[1:14:20] Source all right mhm
[1:14:24] see then what source are
[1:14:27] we now remember we're still back before
[1:14:30] the world what source are
[1:14:31] we we have to be a part of that eternal
[1:14:34] life that's
[1:14:38] right if not we're another source you
[1:14:40] bring us over here with that form in
[1:14:42] mind over that you're thinking see we're
[1:14:43] another source here upon the Earth
[1:14:47] no we're talking about back there right
[1:14:50] but Brother D you're making me think
[1:14:52] that that I was back there me and you
[1:14:54] wouldn't back there Body Spirit Soul as
[1:14:56] human beings that's right right
[1:14:59] amen we're only back there as the part
[1:15:01] of eternal life amen right that was
[1:15:05] imparted unto us by the new birth that's
[1:15:08] the part that is the Eternal that's
[1:15:10] God's Eternal
[1:15:12] thoughts see that way you don't have any
[1:15:14] trouble with it I can take all the
[1:15:16] scripture then and it it all ties
[1:15:19] together you know I I don't have any
[1:15:21] fear of preaching what I preach because
[1:15:23] because not did I just give all the
[1:15:27] quotes but I don't start on something
[1:15:29] like this until God has unfolded it to
[1:15:33] where that I can see
[1:15:36] it and then I try to tell you about what
[1:15:39] I see because I'm trying to get the
[1:15:41] thoughts of God I'm not just trying to
[1:15:42] get a thought from brother brandom
[1:15:46] amen he's the one speaking it but I'm
[1:15:48] wanting you to think about it
[1:15:51] right let go God speak to you why are
[1:15:55] you afraid right well I ain't going down
[1:15:58] there listen brother Dale he might I
[1:16:00] might get confused now you come down
[1:16:02] here you find out you already are amen
[1:16:04] and that's no joke no no sarcasm or no
[1:16:07] hatefulness or nothing just the truth
[1:16:09] right yes sir why are we afraid of
[1:16:11] something if you got eternal life
[1:16:15] amen why are you afraid of the word of
[1:16:17] God CH say something wrong if you're
[1:16:19] afraid of that's right that's right but
[1:16:21] get what I'm trying to get to now if
[1:16:23] we're of the same
[1:16:25] Source then that Source could only be
[1:16:27] the source of eternal life
[1:16:32] right
[1:16:33] right if he's Eternal we're Eternal all
[1:16:37] right we've been through service at a
[1:16:39] service that we're a part of
[1:16:42] God all right we've been through
[1:16:44] services that we're we're we're God made
[1:16:47] manifest we're his offspring right see
[1:16:51] we've been through those things to try
[1:16:52] to bring it down and like I was saying
[1:16:54] about with God see John there brother R
[1:16:58] doesn't mind saying that we were with
[1:17:02] God but now how was Jesus with
[1:17:05] God in the beginning was the word word
[1:17:07] was with God and the Word was God he and
[1:17:11] the Word was one
[1:17:16] right see I preach while that comes back
[1:17:19] but see in
[1:17:20] Genesis when he spoke the word
[1:17:25] y we'll get to 116 so s we'll get back
[1:17:29] to
[1:17:29] there that when he spoke the word there
[1:17:32] was no way to change it amen his
[1:17:34] offspring was going to come amen that's
[1:17:36] right because that is the eternal life
[1:17:39] okay now look at the next one in number
[1:17:42] four in you
[1:17:44] notes this is taken from uh the Mighty
[1:17:48] God unveil before 1964
[1:17:52] 629
[1:17:54] but when he come expressed exactly like
[1:17:56] the Testament had said he would be
[1:17:59] expressed then all those who were
[1:18:02] redeemable y believed it y because they
[1:18:06] were the thoughts of God y why do you
[1:18:09] believe in Salvation yep that's right
[1:18:13] well now brother a lot of people in the
[1:18:14] world believe in but now you you know
[1:18:16] what I'm saying why do you believe this
[1:18:19] message
[1:18:20] right and why do the world don't believe
[1:18:23] this message
[1:18:25] right most the religious world don't
[1:18:27] believe this message
[1:18:29] right because they got some other
[1:18:31] thoughts right that's
[1:18:34] right but how can it be that we right so
[1:18:39] what were we we were redeemable because
[1:18:42] we were the thoughts of God the
[1:18:45] attributes of him at the beginning was
[1:18:48] made flesh and redeemable and was
[1:18:50] brought back to God as many as received
[1:18:53] him to them gave him power to become
[1:18:55] sons of God because they were redeemable
[1:18:58] they were from the beginning in the
[1:19:00] expression now if you look to your notes
[1:19:02] you have to see it's not on a lot of
[1:19:04] there a computer hooked me up wrong
[1:19:10] okay let's get a little bit CU I know we
[1:19:12] ain't going to get very far but look
[1:19:15] look the next identify Christ of all
[1:19:16] ages
[1:19:17] 19640
[1:19:19] 401 now we find that in St John the 1
[1:19:22] chapter beginning with the first verse
[1:19:24] it says in the beginning was the word
[1:19:26] and the Word was with
[1:19:28] God now that's the
[1:19:32] attributes his
[1:19:36] words they thoughts
[1:19:39] now they're not
[1:19:44] expressed so it was a time now which one
[1:19:47] getting that though you'll
[1:19:49] see
[1:19:51] one we on
[1:19:53] oh we're on the wrong Jo
[1:19:56] on
[1:20:00] yeah okay we're supposed to be on number
[1:20:07] five that's that's number five
[1:20:12] yeah okay that's number five I'll get
[1:20:15] back to what I was on the other I was
[1:20:16] looking down on the page and reading it
[1:20:17] off here okay number
[1:20:21] five so what I mean attributes was his
[1:20:24] thoughts right and a word his thought
[1:20:26] expressed right and then that was in his
[1:20:29] thinking and when he said let there be
[1:20:32] and there was let there be and there
[1:20:35] was
[1:20:37] now you know when he said in the
[1:20:39] beginning let us make
[1:20:42] man
[1:20:46] amen you know what brother R said about
[1:20:51] that one time he he said it was word and
[1:20:54] spirit you know what he said it was
[1:20:56] another
[1:20:58] time he said God was talking to the
[1:21:04] animals what he doing he talking to the
[1:21:08] animals when he said let us be let us
[1:21:10] make
[1:21:12] man see it's not always that we think
[1:21:14] about let us is just got to be half a
[1:21:16] dozen
[1:21:17] people word and spirit
[1:21:20] one okay and word word is a thought
[1:21:23] expressed and then that was his thinking
[1:21:27] when he said let there be and there was
[1:21:29] let there be and there was and now
[1:21:31] remember you Christians were his
[1:21:34] thoughts before there was a world and
[1:21:37] you are the manifestation of his
[1:21:40] thinking before there even was a world
[1:21:43] you were in Christ amen in God in the
[1:21:47] beginning that makes you then you see
[1:21:49] his subjects and the whole thing is
[1:21:52] going God himself materializing himself
[1:21:54] tangible so he could be handled seen and
[1:21:57] so forth and that's what God is the
[1:22:00] whole thing that's right Paradox 64 206
[1:22:04] to be
[1:22:05] served but real genuine Faith don't move
[1:22:09] them disciples couldn't explain it but
[1:22:12] they know there it was
[1:22:15] listen see it has to be something that
[1:22:18] God
[1:22:20] planted had to be his thoughts before
[1:22:23] the foundation of the world when he
[1:22:25] planned the whole redeemed Ephesians 1
[1:22:30] 1-5 he planned the whole thing before
[1:22:33] the foundation of the world his his
[1:22:35] thoughts and this is the attributes of
[1:22:37] his thoughts this is exactly what we are
[1:22:40] right life is a thought expressed sure
[1:22:45] right what we've been to all these years
[1:22:47] or thousands of years on Earth as the
[1:22:49] thought of God Express but you know what
[1:22:51] his bride being a part of him is an
[1:22:53] expressed attribute now right amen but
[1:22:56] it's when you receive it right amen you
[1:22:59] got to receive eternal life to be a part
[1:23:02] of eternal life well what do you mean
[1:23:05] Eternal Eternal if I got Eternal always
[1:23:08] had it that's as far as God is concerned
[1:23:11] that's it
[1:23:12] amen that's see what you don't realize
[1:23:15] to think of what you're doing is you're
[1:23:17] taking Satan's lie in the beginning when
[1:23:18] he begin to want to do and said he
[1:23:20] wanted to be as God then he wanted to be
[1:23:22] like God later on and he wanted to
[1:23:24] become God there in the
[1:23:26] scriptures why because that's what he
[1:23:28] wants to be right yep you're picking
[1:23:31] that thought up from
[1:23:32] him instead of taking God's thoughts cuz
[1:23:35] God's thoughts never will make us go
[1:23:36] wrong right amen
[1:23:39] amen there's no such thing as going
[1:23:41] wrong with God's thoughts amen they
[1:23:44] won't cross each other they won't do
[1:23:46] wrong his thoughts is perfect and
[1:23:48] eternal amen he can't change it that's
[1:23:51] right he can't think of you being one
[1:23:53] thing here and then something else over
[1:23:56] here that wouldn't work we not do that
[1:23:59] with our own thoughts all but
[1:24:03] look the token 1964 308 paragraph
[1:24:07] 38 and any Greek scholar knows that
[1:24:10] that's the word eternal life comes from
[1:24:12] the word Zoe Zoe which means God's own
[1:24:15] life that's right and the only way that
[1:24:18] you ever can have life there is only one
[1:24:22] form of eternal life and that's God's
[1:24:25] own life in you see then you have
[1:24:28] eternal life because he is the only
[1:24:31] Eternal there is and we are the
[1:24:35] attributes of his thoughts before there
[1:24:38] was even a foundation of the world or
[1:24:40] anything all this is just his thinking
[1:24:42] and we're the display of his thoughts of
[1:24:45] what it was that's all we're doing here
[1:24:48] as Christians we're just living out what
[1:24:50] God thought before the world Amen and
[1:24:52] knew that we would be so why would it be
[1:24:55] any trouble but he also knew in this
[1:24:56] last days there going to be a change
[1:24:59] amen this is he not going to church and
[1:25:01] being good and and and you know just
[1:25:03] amen we're not talking about that this
[1:25:05] is the only age where man had to be
[1:25:07] concerned with this entire being that
[1:25:09] you're looking at amen that's right see
[1:25:11] we wasn't concerned in the ages about we
[1:25:13] were just concerned to go to heaven get
[1:25:15] saved go to this now I'm not saying
[1:25:17] anything wrong now for you you get me
[1:25:19] wrong you you got the wrong idea I wrode
[1:25:21] by a place the other day it said 18
[1:25:25] converts and I thought call I hope is
[1:25:28] 18 right that was all my thought right I
[1:25:31] didn't have the wrong thought I said I
[1:25:32] hope there 18
[1:25:35] convert yep you know come man wouldn't
[1:25:38] that be something 18 converts brother
[1:25:42] Bram go over in Africa and have 30,000
[1:25:44] in one
[1:25:46] service that
[1:25:51] something cuz see I'm concerned with
[1:25:53] people too Amen brother all right so
[1:25:57] where we
[1:25:58] at identification
[1:26:00] 1964
[1:26:02] 216 paragraph 51 52 3 4 and 5 55 you
[1:26:08] know then see God came down and the
[1:26:12] character of God was Christ he he was
[1:26:15] the reflection he was God made visible
[1:26:18] notice God made visible in the beginning
[1:26:21] was God he wasn't even God then no God
[1:26:25] is an object of worship only thing he
[1:26:28] was was the Eternal y see that's what
[1:26:31] I've tried my to drive into us we have
[1:26:33] educated ourselves enough to know that
[1:26:36] when somebody walk up to us and they say
[1:26:39] well you know God
[1:26:43] we you don't even know the
[1:26:46] story God's just an object of
[1:26:49] worship yeah
[1:26:53] right is it where M
[1:26:57] Cliff we know he always was God right
[1:27:01] you said no no no he wasn't he always
[1:27:04] was the father he always was the Healer
[1:27:06] he always was the Savior if not where
[1:27:09] did it come
[1:27:10] from I tried to drive that into you for
[1:27:13] what for years now that God never gained
[1:27:16] an attribute by coming into this world
[1:27:18] he displayed the
[1:27:20] attribute when he made angs and they
[1:27:22] worshiping that was a display of the
[1:27:25] attribute that was not the attribute the
[1:27:27] attribute was
[1:27:29] God but see we think we're so educated
[1:27:33] into it that we we think we know all of
[1:27:35] the quotes yeah and well and good I'm
[1:27:39] the one who taught you those things but
[1:27:41] I think it's about time to be able to
[1:27:43] get p a quote to get back to what the
[1:27:45] man's talking
[1:27:46] about yep that's right well he didn't
[1:27:49] read that right he missed
[1:27:53] that
[1:27:55] no what was a man talking about
[1:27:59] right and he
[1:28:01] explains but look what he
[1:28:04] said oh see we think we know all about
[1:28:06] it he wasn't even God then no God's not
[1:28:09] work only thing he was was the Eternal
[1:28:11] and in him was
[1:28:15] attributes those attributes is god
[1:28:18] father son Holy Spirit
[1:28:23] healer savior Redeemer
[1:28:26] Advocate what else you want to name off
[1:28:30] right that was a part of God Amen we
[1:28:33] look at the display of it yes see yep
[1:28:38] all right and you better remember one
[1:28:40] thing now you're going to get to this
[1:28:41] one day so you better write this down
[1:28:43] and remember
[1:28:44] it before he was God in his thoughts of
[1:28:49] being
[1:28:51] God the eternal life that I have already
[1:28:56] existed absolutely yes sir you better
[1:28:58] write that down absolutely you can say
[1:29:00] brother Dale's going off on it let it
[1:29:02] you can go what you want
[1:29:05] to eternal life is eternal life amen
[1:29:08] that's
[1:29:10] right only thing he was was the Eternal
[1:29:14] and in him was attribution those
[1:29:16] attributes were thoughts those thoughts
[1:29:18] were expressed to words and words was
[1:29:20] word was made this what is it it's all
[1:29:24] God becoming tangible and you are a part
[1:29:27] of God and Jesus come to redeem those
[1:29:30] that was put on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:29:33] before the foundation of the world it
[1:29:35] was in God's thoughts and that's what he
[1:29:38] come to redeem Y and them as soon as it
[1:29:41] strikes them they see it because the
[1:29:43] life is in there the life is in there
[1:29:46] you the life of connection the
[1:29:49] connection backward right why is it you
[1:29:52] receive this message and others walk
[1:29:54] away from it life you right
[1:29:58] yep y amen but if the life isn't in
[1:30:01] there then what can they do see they
[1:30:04] don't see it and they'll never see it
[1:30:07] that's
[1:30:08] right that's
[1:30:10] right amen you say will that make no it
[1:30:14] don't make
[1:30:18] us and the whole thing is Jesus said
[1:30:20] that day you'll know that I'm in the
[1:30:22] father and father in me and I in you and
[1:30:23] you in me now that's easy to explain I
[1:30:28] in you how many years have I been on
[1:30:31] that where Jesus said I in
[1:30:35] you okay New Birth comes into us we have
[1:30:38] his life now explain you and
[1:30:43] me come on I'm read the Bible That's
[1:30:46] Right Jesus said I
[1:30:50] you and you in
[1:30:55] me see the Bible full of the great
[1:30:57] beautiful nuggets and we just read it
[1:31:00] that's right and get an
[1:31:03] understanding he said it's like a
[1:31:05] husband and
[1:31:07] wife let's get a few
[1:31:10] more first as we would see Jesus 64318
[1:31:13] in the beginning God was not even God he
[1:31:16] was the great Eternal and in there was
[1:31:19] attributes attributes was his St
[1:31:21] thoughts then he become a word like this
[1:31:24] and a word expressed well a thought
[1:31:27] expressed is a word and a word a word
[1:31:30] express is a thought then remember if
[1:31:34] you ever was in God's thinking you'll
[1:31:38] always be there if you got eternal life
[1:31:42] that's simple is y if you got eternal
[1:31:46] life see what are you you're the
[1:31:49] expression or the attribute of of his
[1:31:52] thought for this
[1:31:54] age and it's not not you there's only
[1:31:58] one eternal life and it always existed
[1:32:01] and you in his mind existed before there
[1:32:03] was a world that's the reason he said he
[1:32:05] chose you before the foundation of the
[1:32:07] world it isn't what we think what
[1:32:10] somebody else thinks it's what God
[1:32:13] Eternal you always was see in his
[1:32:16] thinking that's right always was in his
[1:32:19] thinking right we only got three more
[1:32:21] Pages
[1:32:27] too just remember we haven't covered it
[1:32:30] yet we haven't got on to the word
[1:32:32] redeemed
[1:32:33] yet but if we talk about redeemed I
[1:32:36] thought we believe redeemed means to go
[1:32:37] back where you come from that's
[1:32:44] right see we really got to step up in
[1:32:46] our thinking on a deal in I mean not a
[1:32:48] deal of quote in a church seal book
[1:32:50] excuse me for
[1:32:55] deal you know that we fell from eternal
[1:32:57] life that's
[1:32:59] right right yep
[1:33:03] absolutely see I know brother always T
[1:33:06] you that you can't fall from eternal
[1:33:07] life cuz that's not we're talk what
[1:33:09] we're talking about
[1:33:11] right the Adam felt from eternal life to
[1:33:14] death in the garden right that's right
[1:33:16] but he never lost the eternal life that
[1:33:17] was in his soul right man no way you
[1:33:20] can't lose eternal life that's right so
[1:33:22] when we get to it one of these days and
[1:33:23] we talk about falling from eternal life
[1:33:25] just remember it's not our words right
[1:33:27] it's not our thoughts it's what God
[1:33:32] says it was the way he brought us here
[1:33:36] right y not a fault the way he brought
[1:33:39] us here okay give you a lot of things
[1:33:42] ahead of time cuz see I I know where I'm
[1:33:44] going to be going eventually with all of
[1:33:47] this so he says
[1:33:50] in the identified Christ of all ages
[1:33:53] 6441 he's talking about and we find out
[1:33:56] in John the first chapter beginning with
[1:33:58] the first verse it says in the beginning
[1:33:59] was the word and the Word was with God
[1:34:02] now that's the attributes his words they
[1:34:05] thoughts now they're not expressed now
[1:34:08] we on the one I was trying to read off
[1:34:10] of Cu what I was doing slide it down
[1:34:11] like this okay now what's what he
[1:34:16] saying it wasn't word now I don't have
[1:34:20] these written down so you know I try to
[1:34:23] just speak as I can off of it you order
[1:34:24] to be able to remember it's in the
[1:34:26] second seal I'm pretty sure maybe the
[1:34:29] number will come to him in a minute but
[1:34:32] brother randam said that God had
[1:34:36] thoughts and he said it were not word
[1:34:40] yet now listen sure he said he spoke it
[1:34:43] to Moses he said it was God's thought he
[1:34:47] said then it become Moses
[1:34:49] thought he said then Moses spoke it it
[1:34:51] became
[1:34:53] word right
[1:34:55] amen right see when Moses spoke it it
[1:34:59] became word you know what God's want me
[1:35:00] and you to do speak it come on we got to
[1:35:04] speak it to be healed yes right you got
[1:35:06] to speak it to be saved that scripture
[1:35:08] in in Romans there I remember that I
[1:35:11] heard it so much in the Baptist Church I
[1:35:14] got didn't want to hear that scripture
[1:35:15] to the Lord he said get away from that
[1:35:17] it ain't what I'm saying but in the
[1:35:18] Baptist we just read it you know to the
[1:35:20] whole congregation is a blanket if you
[1:35:22] just can believe in your heart and
[1:35:24] confess with your mouth you're saved so
[1:35:27] just come on up here and shake my hand
[1:35:29] and go
[1:35:31] back that's reason I didn't quy I was 18
[1:35:34] years old before I'd ever even step
[1:35:38] out but see because I seen so many come
[1:35:40] up and it's like that little boy said
[1:35:43] you heard it told you know right he's
[1:35:46] asking all of them in a little group
[1:35:47] that came up you know what the Lord do
[1:35:49] for you today Lord save me that's one
[1:35:51] little boy say what God do you ain't
[1:35:53] done nothing yet you know what he's
[1:35:55] probably the most honest one in the
[1:35:57] whole
[1:35:58] crowd right that's right cuz he just
[1:36:00] telling it like it was y see I wouldn't
[1:36:03] going to be no hypocrite about it
[1:36:05] right but you see God's wanting you and
[1:36:08] I to speak the word what do you think
[1:36:10] this is all about oh only for brother
[1:36:12] Rand to speak the word big man in this
[1:36:15] message that's what he says said the
[1:36:17] spoken word was only for brother randam
[1:36:19] and and the Lord
[1:36:20] Jesus well then we're going to have to
[1:36:22] rip out the Bible and we're going to
[1:36:23] have to rip out the
[1:36:25] message of course that ain't going to
[1:36:27] turn nobody away from listening to him
[1:36:29] and I'm not trying to because I don't
[1:36:31] want him here with that thought about it
[1:36:34] it take me a year or two to get that out
[1:36:35] of
[1:36:38] them but now
[1:36:41] listen say now now they're not expressed
[1:36:45] right yep there was a time when God's
[1:36:49] word was God's word but it was not an
[1:36:51] Express word right you
[1:36:54] agree his word was before and he was
[1:36:57] going to you know everything was there
[1:36:58] in him in the beginning was his word but
[1:37:01] there wasn't a world right and then he
[1:37:04] spoke it and it was expressed
[1:37:07] amen right see it become the
[1:37:10] expression that's what we talk about
[1:37:13] that he wasn't God until he created
[1:37:15] angels and any wor he's always
[1:37:17] God he always was the Healer you said no
[1:37:20] he couldn't be a Healer cuz he was lost
[1:37:21] see we got quotes how many quotes
[1:37:24] brother see we keep
[1:37:30] breing salvation made an expression of
[1:37:33] the
[1:37:35] thought the thought was already there he
[1:37:38] always was
[1:37:39] God he always was the Healer he always
[1:37:42] was the
[1:37:44] Savior oh my Lord you want to go on to
[1:37:46] 2:00 that's
[1:37:49] quit listen
[1:37:54] 1964 409 which identified Christ of all
[1:37:57] ages that was paragraph 20 this is going
[1:38:01] down to 68 6970 71
[1:38:05] 72 now in first John or St John the
[1:38:08] first chapter we find out here is what
[1:38:09] the writer said then the inspired by the
[1:38:13] Holy Spirit he wrote this in the
[1:38:15] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:38:16] with God and the Word was God and the
[1:38:17] Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:38:20] may I break it down
[1:38:21] in the beginning was the Eternal he
[1:38:24] wasn't even
[1:38:25] God God our English word god is an
[1:38:28] object of worship but he there wasn't
[1:38:30] nothing to worship him he was just the
[1:38:32] Eternal in him was attributes anybody
[1:38:35] knows what an attribute is in other
[1:38:36] words it's him in him was his thoughts
[1:38:40] just thoughts that's his attribute then
[1:38:42] his word and a thought expressed is a
[1:38:45] word in the beginning was a word because
[1:38:47] it was even before it was even expressed
[1:38:50] it was a thought
[1:38:51] attributes right in this thinking he was
[1:38:55] to be God probably created the Angels
[1:38:58] first then he was worshiped he was God
[1:39:02] then in him was attributes to be father
[1:39:04] to be son to be savior nothing
[1:39:07] lost but watch it something had to be
[1:39:12] lost amen the fall is not not something
[1:39:16] that Satan pulled over on
[1:39:18] God something had to be like lost so
[1:39:22] there had to be a way made for that
[1:39:27] yep to be healer nothing sick so he had
[1:39:31] so he had something had to get sick so
[1:39:34] he could heal it it's only displaying
[1:39:36] his attributes
[1:39:38] right you see what I'm
[1:39:44] saying a way had to be made y now this
[1:39:47] goes on to where we we back up right
[1:39:49] here when we come down and see drop out
[1:39:51] of heaven and come to Earth y right so
[1:39:55] it had to be in God's plan and
[1:39:59] purpose to bring man into the
[1:40:02] world and to know if he gave us freeo
[1:40:08] agency we would choose wrong
[1:40:10] right you said but brother Dale is not
[1:40:13] show today you better be
[1:40:15] careful but I've got eternal life Adam
[1:40:18] had eternal life
[1:40:21] but Adam didn't Adam didn't believe
[1:40:24] Satan Adam walked out with his wife
[1:40:26] thinking some way he could get her back
[1:40:28] and that was contrary to God's word
[1:40:31] right because there was no way Adam was
[1:40:32] going to get her back no sir because
[1:40:34] that was God's plan and purpose not that
[1:40:38] he made the man fall he couldn't make us
[1:40:41] fall and condemn us for being lost
[1:40:43] that's right come on but he knew all he
[1:40:47] had to do was let us be here that's
[1:40:49] right you know right now
[1:40:51] if something don't come out of this
[1:40:53] message to take you in a change we're
[1:40:55] going by the ground that's right we may
[1:40:58] be around here 40 more years somebody
[1:41:00] else will be up here screaming and
[1:41:01] hollering this but if we don't get it
[1:41:03] revealed to us right that's it amen
[1:41:06] we're freeo agents today that's right
[1:41:10] yes sir you got a right to go home and
[1:41:11] say brother Dale's off and I ain't
[1:41:13] listening to him no
[1:41:15] more that's you're right that's right
[1:41:19] but what does the Holy Ghost Say that's
[1:41:21] right Holy Ghost says well I don't
[1:41:22] understand him a lot of times well don't
[1:41:23] worry about it I don't understand
[1:41:28] myself I just wait for
[1:41:31] him and I lay at bed and I said this
[1:41:33] morning for
[1:41:35] our thinking
[1:41:37] about
[1:41:40] heaven thinking about
[1:41:44] God thinking about everything being
[1:41:49] real eternal life to the real
[1:41:53] person not a thought it's not a apple of
[1:41:55] electricity no amen oh it's so much
[1:41:57] greater than a apple of electricity
[1:42:00] electricity and him in I quote what was
[1:42:03] thinking I was listen or looking this
[1:42:05] morning at her it's either in here one
[1:42:07] when I get to it but it's like brother
[1:42:09] Rand want to say and he said you know
[1:42:10] that it comes up T night you know
[1:42:13] Darkness like but he said at night it's
[1:42:16] so
[1:42:17] light now he's not talking about natural
[1:42:20] things
[1:42:25] it was in The Darkest
[1:42:27] Hour of the Christian
[1:42:30] church when God stepped on the scene and
[1:42:33] remember brother brandom said there was
[1:42:34] just a little bit of Halo of light left
[1:42:36] and as a matter of fact he said I put
[1:42:38] that in there you remember that he said
[1:42:41] I put it in there God showed it total
[1:42:44] darkness but you know what in total
[1:42:46] darkness is supposed to be the greatest
[1:42:47] light of all right cuz that's what I
[1:42:49] thought we believed there where talks
[1:42:51] about in the scripture about when the
[1:42:52] towers
[1:42:53] fall and the light of the sun would be
[1:42:56] seven times lighter and the light of the
[1:42:58] Moon would be same as the same as the
[1:43:01] sun that's right you know in Goan
[1:43:05] mhm Egypt was black till Let It Feel
[1:43:08] It In Goan there was light you know I
[1:43:12] don't understand them people I know it's
[1:43:15] just human well I mean I'm a dummy but I
[1:43:18] I look
[1:43:19] overly if I could just make it to that
[1:43:23] light you at least I could see me
[1:43:27] sitting over here day after day and it's
[1:43:29] black right ah come on you don't want to
[1:43:33] go over there with them because you be
[1:43:34] one of them nuts well that's okay
[1:43:38] amen all right let's read a couple
[1:43:42] more should be number 12 when you note
[1:43:44] 64 44 415 Christ is identified the same
[1:43:47] and all a matter of fact you had to
[1:43:48] listen to this whole message Christ
[1:43:50] identified in all ages it would be a
[1:43:52] good one to just get and do I I thought
[1:43:55] about it this
[1:43:56] morning if you would
[1:43:58] just you need sometimes a help to be
[1:44:01] able to lay out something for you to
[1:44:02] study some people will say you know
[1:44:04] brother Dale what should I
[1:44:06] study that you have
[1:44:08] time why don't you just take like one
[1:44:11] service one time a day and just listen
[1:44:13] to a
[1:44:14] tap and won't you just start like in 65
[1:44:17] and go
[1:44:19] backwards right
[1:44:22] you know just take one a
[1:44:25] day you know you'll see that brother
[1:44:28] Dale's right about what he's saying
[1:44:29] because you'll see brother if you can't
[1:44:31] see as much quotes I give you but you
[1:44:33] know but it just give you the
[1:44:38] idea of how beautiful this message is
[1:44:41] okay Christ identified the same in all
[1:44:44] ages say paragraph
[1:44:48] 1516 God like in the beginning he was
[1:44:51] just God well he wasn't really God he
[1:44:54] was just the Eternal God God is an
[1:44:56] English word god means an object of
[1:44:58] worship and there was nothing to worship
[1:44:59] him he was self-existing Elohim so there
[1:45:02] was nothing to worship him so he was
[1:45:04] just the Eternal the great Eternal but
[1:45:06] in him were at was attributes and
[1:45:09] attributes is his thoughts just like you
[1:45:12] have to think of something before you
[1:45:14] speak it right then when you speak it it
[1:45:18] becomes a word all right
[1:45:21] so now that's what God wants us he wants
[1:45:22] us to speak his word right you got to
[1:45:25] say you're healed you got to say you're
[1:45:26] saved you going to have to say you're
[1:45:28] changed somebody going to have to say it
[1:45:32] and then walk into it just how just like
[1:45:36] you have to think of anything because
[1:45:38] before you speak it then when you speak
[1:45:40] it it becomes a word and then he is the
[1:45:42] Eternal and in him was attributes and he
[1:45:44] spoken and it was the word and the word
[1:45:46] is made manifest and the word is made
[1:45:48] manifest is God becoming
[1:45:51] material all right that's right let's
[1:45:53] take the next two which is it's in the
[1:45:57] same message now the Mighty God unveiled
[1:45:59] so brother Joe may have to split from 71
[1:46:00] to 78 I was trying to help them and
[1:46:03] found out we can't help just you know
[1:46:05] I'm lost in this trying to help I just
[1:46:07] go ahead and print it out and get it to
[1:46:09] they figure it out all right this is on
[1:46:11] the Mighty God unveil before us 64629
[1:46:14] paragraph 71 so God in the beginning was
[1:46:17] life the Eternal one in him was
[1:46:19] attributes and those attributes become
[1:46:21] words became words and the word became
[1:46:25] flesh Jesus was the Redeemer to redeem
[1:46:28] means to bring back if he has to bring
[1:46:31] it back it had to be somewhere to be
[1:46:34] brought back too so you see all people
[1:46:37] will never be able to see it because all
[1:46:40] people wasn't in the beginning in God's
[1:46:42] thoughts now that's simple that's not
[1:46:45] degrading
[1:46:46] nobody now paragraph
[1:46:49] 78 but when he come expressed exactly
[1:46:52] like the Testament said he would be
[1:46:54] expressed then all those who were
[1:46:58] redeemable believed it y because they
[1:47:00] were the thoughts of God the attributes
[1:47:02] of him at the beginning was made flesh
[1:47:04] and redeemable and was brought back
[1:47:06] brought back to God as many as received
[1:47:09] him to them gave he power to become sons
[1:47:12] of God because they were redeemable they
[1:47:14] were for the from the beginning in the
[1:47:16] expression that's right
[1:47:19] listen we talk about redeemed let me
[1:47:21] just cover that just a
[1:47:23] second anything that's
[1:47:26] redeemable means it goes back to where
[1:47:28] it come
[1:47:29] from all right
[1:47:33] now this
[1:47:35] world was a creation by the word of God
[1:47:39] that's correct amen you agree amen see
[1:47:42] it was a beautiful state a state or what
[1:47:44] you want to call it
[1:47:47] perfect and you know it can be redeemed
[1:47:50] mhm and this world will be brought to a
[1:47:53] condition one
[1:47:55] day of like it was in the beginning only
[1:47:58] I believe it's going to be stepped on
[1:47:59] over right I I'll get to that in
[1:48:00] messages later I believe this world is
[1:48:02] going to be Eternal amen it's going to
[1:48:05] have to be be given eternal life CU see
[1:48:07] if it goes back to where it was it would
[1:48:09] only go back to an existence of when God
[1:48:12] said let there
[1:48:14] be all right see and that would be
[1:48:17] redeemed now and there will be people on
[1:48:19] this Earth
[1:48:21] yep that God saw and come into the world
[1:48:24] and do things like that and as far as
[1:48:26] they can be redeemed that's why he would
[1:48:27] say it see that everything's not
[1:48:29] redeemable see as far as they exist to
[1:48:32] where they done what they done to to for
[1:48:35] God to look down a cup of water in my
[1:48:38] name or or or something good that was
[1:48:40] done see now that people can only be
[1:48:43] redeemed back to that
[1:48:45] place see which means they can't come
[1:48:48] back to being Sons and Daughters of of a
[1:48:50] living God right am they will only come
[1:48:52] back to the existence of where there'll
[1:48:54] be foolish virgins fifal Jews the things
[1:48:57] like that even the 144,000 that receive
[1:48:59] eternal life on this Earth will be
[1:49:01] servants to the bride right amen right
[1:49:05] that's right yes and see but yet see
[1:49:07] there's a people that can be
[1:49:10] redeemed y right there's a people that
[1:49:14] can be redeemed that's right you know
[1:49:17] why because they're redeemable amen
[1:49:19] right
[1:49:21] amen and we can be redeemed back who
[1:49:23] where we
[1:49:26] were now that's where God's going to
[1:49:28] have to give this body spirit and soul
[1:49:32] eternal life that's
[1:49:34] right to change you know and everything
[1:49:37] else and then that way we'll be Eternal
[1:49:39] but the New Birth has already made your
[1:49:41] soul
[1:49:43] Eternal yep if you have a new birth
[1:49:46] today your soul don't have to be Eternal
[1:49:48] it already is eternal amen amen that's
[1:49:53] right and that's why we could be
[1:49:55] redeemed right we'll get back to
[1:49:59] that and see get to where we can cover
[1:50:03] it let me say this to you and you study
[1:50:05] on it for a while about the lounge Book
[1:50:08] of Life brother col is your name written
[1:50:11] in the lounge Book of
[1:50:13] Life no I know he here but he knows I'm
[1:50:16] fixing to pool something
[1:50:17] but and James colly wouldn't didn't
[1:50:26] there Ray Gabriel was not written in the
[1:50:31] Lamb's Book of
[1:50:33] Life it's written in the book of life
[1:50:37] section y go to Invisible Union where
[1:50:40] the Prophet say it's got to be
[1:50:42] transferred and once it's transferred is
[1:50:44] not that same name right see we're going
[1:50:47] some more
[1:50:48] folks we're going back back to the real
[1:50:50] you that's right yes sir and your
[1:50:55] name of natural life was written in a
[1:51:01] book but the book of eternal
[1:51:05] life that name is not the same here as
[1:51:07] it is over
[1:51:10] here see we get a new name
[1:51:14] amen think on these things because see
[1:51:19] the message is not
[1:51:20] cuz I've always told you I've been in a
[1:51:23] Revival ever since I've been in this
[1:51:26] message and doesn't matter to me how
[1:51:29] sick I have L your brain just run in you
[1:51:33] dreaming crazy dreams all night at 5:00
[1:51:37] when I woke
[1:51:40] up just lay her look at things
[1:51:47] right and see it that's
[1:51:52] real take what I said about them
[1:51:54] Dimensions while ago because that will
[1:51:56] be the key later on which dimension do
[1:51:59] you think is the
[1:52:00] greatest right the seventh or the one
[1:52:04] you know right 1 2 3 is what we're in
[1:52:06] which we're into lifel and matter Y and
[1:52:09] even Einstein says in this
[1:52:13] Dimension if you had unlimited
[1:52:15] eyesight you would look out and see the
[1:52:18] back of your head
[1:52:28] but you
[1:52:30] see the word of God is
[1:52:33] eternal not letters on a page right the
[1:52:37] thoughts of God are
[1:52:39] Eternal not just because he thought of
[1:52:42] it I've always told you that right I've
[1:52:44] always said that I didn't want to be I
[1:52:45] didn't want to be thought of in heaven I
[1:52:47] mean that's wonderful that would be
[1:52:49] great but that's not the
[1:52:51] story I want to be part of the Thinker
[1:52:54] am that's right how many years have I
[1:52:56] been preaching that part of the Thinker
[1:53:00] the one who done the thinking is there
[1:53:03] any difference in the eternal life that
[1:53:04] was in Jesus Christ and eternal life in
[1:53:07] you that's right what's the
[1:53:10] difference that's hard to
[1:53:13] comprehend that's right yeah you just
[1:53:15] Bel little in him no no I'm trying to
[1:53:18] upgrade us Amen to get us to see right
[1:53:22] come on Brothers think on these things

[1:53:28] Sunday I pretty good
[1:53:35] sh but what about the thoughts of
[1:53:39] God and what about those thoughts being
[1:53:42] Eternal that's
[1:53:43] right and then we are the same
[1:53:47] Source you remember that
[1:53:51] we come from the same
[1:53:53] source so if we come from the same
[1:53:56] Source the eternal life that I'm talking
[1:54:00] about would have to be the life of God
[1:54:03] right not a new doctor I want to get on
[1:54:06] that when we get to where it says and
[1:54:08] you can look at them and there's
